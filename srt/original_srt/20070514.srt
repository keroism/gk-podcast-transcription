1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,214
Speaker 0: It's Monday May 14th.

2
00:00:12,715 --> 00:00:13,276
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:15,840
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek night.

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:25,550
Speaker 0: Tonight we give you a brief overview of IT security which will probably lead to a long-running series on IT security.

5
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:28,328
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:32,055 --> 00:00:41,579
Speaker 0: So you're all aware that I've been Painting over the decision to buy a new computer for the past several months and last wait Past several decades there you go.

7
00:00:41,839 --> 00:00:44,709
Speaker 0: No because I really wasn't looking for a new computer until just now.

8
00:00:45,732 --> 00:00:46,835
Speaker 1: You needed one.

9
00:00:46,955 --> 00:00:47,496
Speaker 0: not really.

10
00:00:47,536 --> 00:00:49,542
Speaker 0: yeah, there's nothing wrong with my computer.

11
00:00:50,203 --> 00:00:51,246
Speaker 1: It's pretty bad.

12
00:00:51,266 --> 00:00:52,730
Speaker 0: It does the show just fine.

13
00:00:53,292 --> 00:00:59,551
Speaker 1: I think you're the only one in the listening to the show or any way related to the show that would be satisfied with that Computer.

14
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:00,192
Speaker 1: you've got there.

15
00:01:00,453 --> 00:01:05,045
Speaker 0: this computer can do an entire four nights a week podcast with no problems.

16
00:01:05,285 --> 00:01:08,519
Speaker 1: It can barely do it Barely actually.

17
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:20,062
Speaker 0: no the only problems It's really having are That some of the components like the fans have started to fail and I really didn't want to spend the money to replace it and the Usbs and sometimes it doesn't boot and it's horribly slow.

18
00:01:20,082 --> 00:01:21,647
Speaker 0: It's not that slow and any day now.

19
00:01:21,687 --> 00:01:22,650
Speaker 1: It's gonna explode.

20
00:01:23,252 --> 00:01:28,510
Speaker 0: It takes less than 10 minutes to do all the post-processing of geek nights despite it being a 1 gigahertz process.

21
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:29,553
Speaker 1: That's pretty slow.

22
00:01:29,573 --> 00:01:30,857
Speaker 0: That's not that bad.

23
00:01:31,098 --> 00:01:32,803
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay, anyway.

24
00:01:32,823 --> 00:01:38,510
Speaker 0: I don't need new one for well The only reason I really need a new one is I want to play a bunch of PC games.

25
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:41,682
Speaker 0: So I get this new PC.

26
00:01:41,742 --> 00:01:42,507
Speaker 0: I ordered everything.

27
00:01:42,527 --> 00:01:46,927
Speaker 0: it all came I put it all together, and it doesn't boot doesn't even post.

28
00:01:47,048 --> 00:01:55,553
Speaker 0: in fact It has a little readout that shows me what part of the post and CMOS and all that it gets to and it doesn't even Get past the first step.

29
00:01:55,934 --> 00:02:04,844
Speaker 1: Yeah, it basically says all right enable ATX power supply wait for ATX power supply to be ready Wait for ATX powers apply to be ready forever.

30
00:02:05,287 --> 00:02:05,890
Speaker 1: It's never ready.

31
00:02:06,161 --> 00:02:13,849
Speaker 0: Yeah It doesn't even get to the point where the RAM or the CPU or anything to be the problem And it doesn't even get to a point where I can seriously diagnose anything.

32
00:02:13,869 --> 00:02:17,121
Speaker 1: yeah I know we just you take the motherboard out of the box right?

33
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:18,044
Speaker 1: so it's the motherboard.

34
00:02:18,285 --> 00:02:20,535
Speaker 1: you take the power supply out of The box you put them on.

35
00:02:20,616 --> 00:02:21,621
Speaker 1: you know a mat.

36
00:02:21,902 --> 00:02:23,169
Speaker 1: you plug in the power supply.

37
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:25,419
Speaker 1: so no It's just the power supply the motherboard no CPU.

38
00:02:25,459 --> 00:02:25,860
Speaker 1: No RAM.

39
00:02:25,881 --> 00:02:26,543
Speaker 1: No video card.

40
00:02:26,584 --> 00:02:28,070
Speaker 1: No nothing no case.

41
00:02:28,471 --> 00:02:31,679
Speaker 1: No, can't possibly be anything, but the motherboard and the power supply.

42
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,883
Speaker 1: you turn it on.

43
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:36,864
Speaker 1: it says waiting for ATX power supply to be Ready and nothing happens.

44
00:02:37,168 --> 00:02:47,822
Speaker 0: now I'm reasonably certain that the power supply is just fine because the power supply does activate and spin up all the fans and everything Just the CPU or the processor the motherboard the RAM.

45
00:02:47,862 --> 00:02:50,030
Speaker 0: nothing else seems to have any effect.

46
00:02:50,533 --> 00:02:52,650
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's a problem with the motherboard.

47
00:02:53,514 --> 00:02:56,488
Speaker 1: Or perhaps the BIOS needs an update or something like that.

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,574
Speaker 0: well I doubt it's.

49
00:02:57,614 --> 00:03:00,150
Speaker 0: the BIOS needs an update because it doesn't even get to the award pile.

50
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:02,081
Speaker 1: I know, but people are talking about things like that.

51
00:03:02,101 --> 00:03:12,401
Speaker 0: so who knows the only post I saw in regards to that were that Conrose weren't supported with some ass old version of the BIOS from a long time ago when This motherboard was first made.

52
00:03:12,462 --> 00:03:22,170
Speaker 1: yeah, but anyway I just want to say that it really kind of sucks that it's non Trivial to fake when you're building a computer to figure out which power supply will do the trick.

53
00:03:22,573 --> 00:03:26,941
Speaker 1: It's like all these power supplies They say watts, and it's like obviously a power supply.

54
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:31,427
Speaker 1: with more watts you can have more drives You can have a faster better equipment etc.

55
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:31,568
Speaker 1: etc.

56
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:36,570
Speaker 0: Well except for the fact that the people who make up those watt numbers pretty much just lie.

57
00:03:36,811 --> 00:03:40,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, there are plenty of power supplies out there that say like a thousand watts.

58
00:03:40,345 --> 00:03:43,159
Speaker 1: They're not a thousand watts They're just baking up bullshit.

59
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,849
Speaker 1: You know it doesn't also doesn't help.

60
00:03:45,172 --> 00:03:55,482
Speaker 1: There's a whole bunch of other Factors in the power supply like people now talk about how many rails it has and how many volts the rails are and how Many amps you can get total and how that might be.

61
00:03:55,522 --> 00:04:07,150
Speaker 1: it not be enough to boot your motherboard Or it might be enough and they just need to say hey if you have this equipment Then this is the power this these power supplies will be able to boot your mother.

62
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:08,194
Speaker 1: But who's they?

63
00:04:08,274 --> 00:04:09,177
Speaker 0: who's gonna say that?

64
00:04:09,258 --> 00:04:12,570
Speaker 0: every people who make the motherboard, but the motherboard has nothing to do with it.

65
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:14,397
Speaker 0: The motherboard is a very little factor.

66
00:04:14,437 --> 00:04:20,230
Speaker 0: what matters a lot more is how many drives you have what kind of drives they are What kind of video card you have how many of them you have yes?

67
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:31,706
Speaker 1: But obviously in this case if the motherboard isn't broken which it probably is But there are cases where the power supply is just not even sufficient to boot the motherboard.

68
00:04:31,766 --> 00:04:34,595
Speaker 0: however the odds of that are Incredibly low.

69
00:04:34,615 --> 00:04:36,402
Speaker 1: that happened to me way back.

70
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:36,543
Speaker 1: Well.

71
00:04:36,563 --> 00:04:37,245
Speaker 0: That's because you bought.

72
00:04:37,286 --> 00:04:38,370
Speaker 1: happening to a lot of people.

73
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:43,290
Speaker 0: I read around the internet that was one because you bought a tiny weak power supply for a powerful computer.

74
00:04:43,611 --> 00:04:57,645
Speaker 1: I know, but it wasn't well known and it still isn't well known that computers now are requiring more and more powerful power supplies and No one is telling you like the minimum required power supply or anything or the recommended power supply.

75
00:04:57,705 --> 00:04:58,507
Speaker 0: well actually no.

76
00:04:58,608 --> 00:05:05,612
Speaker 0: Intel does tell You what kinds of power supplies they test and a bit does tell you what kinds of power supplies They test and they tell you what'll work Reasonably.

77
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:11,070
Speaker 0: the factor that people run into problems with are the hard drives mostly and the video cards.

78
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:13,193
Speaker 1: I don't know all the problems I've seen are I?

79
00:05:13,334 --> 00:05:14,318
Speaker 1: my computer doesn't boot.

80
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:20,120
Speaker 0: once you've got it booting Scott you realize you can go to a bits website and they List a bunch of power supplies they tested and how many watts they were.

81
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:23,856
Speaker 0: and if you go to Intel they list power supplies they tested How many watts they were.

82
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:26,029
Speaker 1: no I haven't seen that and I've looked for it.

83
00:05:26,532 --> 00:05:29,468
Speaker 0: I found that right away when I was figuring out what power supply to buy.

84
00:05:29,488 --> 00:05:32,120
Speaker 1: well We'll see if I can find it, but regardless.

85
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:34,250
Speaker 1: It's not readily available enough.

86
00:05:34,613 --> 00:05:44,230
Speaker 0: Regardless my goddamn computer won't work And I'm kind of miffed about that and I discovered that new eggs RMA process is currently broken And you can't actually print shipping labels.

87
00:05:44,772 --> 00:05:52,109
Speaker 0: And they seem to be aware that it's broken because when I eventually called them on the phone They immediately manually made me one, and then I could do my business.

88
00:05:52,714 --> 00:05:54,973
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm yeah It does.

89
00:05:55,033 --> 00:06:00,874
Speaker 1: also doesn't help that a bits website was down for like three days and just now is it Finally is up again.

90
00:06:00,894 --> 00:06:01,437
Speaker 0: Is it still up?

91
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:02,984
Speaker 0: because it wasn't up an hour ago.

92
00:06:03,004 --> 00:06:03,888
Speaker 1: It's up right now.

93
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:10,410
Speaker 1: We'll see how it's actually fast right now, which is like a miracle because it's been completely non-existent for days.

94
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, I love a bit, and they make some of the best motherboards out there as head PCs.

95
00:06:15,044 --> 00:06:17,030
Speaker 0: however a bit does have.

96
00:06:17,253 --> 00:06:18,570
Speaker 0: It's kind of like how I went with Sprint.

97
00:06:19,032 --> 00:06:21,302
Speaker 0: They had better coverage where I lived there better prices.

98
00:06:21,322 --> 00:06:25,160
Speaker 0: everything was great about Sprint except They had the worst customer service in the world.

99
00:06:25,522 --> 00:06:27,390
Speaker 0: a bits the same way great products.

100
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:32,430
Speaker 0: But if you try to get a hold of a bit in any fashion you're better off just killing yourself.

101
00:06:32,852 --> 00:06:35,729
Speaker 0: There is no way to talk to a human who knows anything.

102
00:06:35,769 --> 00:06:36,151
Speaker 0: well It's cuz.

103
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:38,963
Speaker 1: they're a Taiwanese company, so just just give up right now.

104
00:06:39,003 --> 00:06:42,374
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean their website Usually doesn't work.

105
00:06:42,475 --> 00:06:46,649
Speaker 0: I'd say it's down more often than not partly because it's hosted in Taiwan.

106
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:53,790
Speaker 0: Mmm now now I point out that the Taiwanese website That's hosted in Taiwan is for US customers.

107
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:57,584
Speaker 0: Every other customer they have in the rest of the world has a different site.

108
00:06:57,604 --> 00:07:02,601
Speaker 0: that isn't hosted in Taiwan and Works just fine, but you can't get support from that site.

109
00:07:02,882 --> 00:07:07,882
Speaker 0: if you're an American who bought it in America You got to go to the a bit USA site in Taiwan.

110
00:07:08,143 --> 00:07:08,886
Speaker 0: that doesn't work.

111
00:07:09,428 --> 00:07:13,181
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it also doesn't help that since a bit is a Taiwanese company.

112
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:16,090
Speaker 1: It's hard for Americans to talk to them to get help.

113
00:07:16,211 --> 00:07:20,110
Speaker 1: I'm sure if we were Taiwanese it would be very easy for a bit to help us very easy.

114
00:07:20,150 --> 00:07:21,709
Speaker 1: They probably would be glad to help us.

115
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:25,491
Speaker 0: but I've read stories of people calling a bit to try to get support and They don't.

116
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:29,124
Speaker 0: it's not like they get an answering machine or some sort of voicemail system or a loop.

117
00:07:29,505 --> 00:07:31,776
Speaker 0: the phone just rings and no One answers.

118
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:40,220
Speaker 1: yeah, but yeah a bit I have you know in my life, but to a bit motherboards and was very happy with both of them But I guess rim got a bad one.

119
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:41,486
Speaker 1: most likely we'll see.

120
00:07:41,506 --> 00:07:42,410
Speaker 0: I are I made it.

121
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:43,355
Speaker 0: So I don't know.

122
00:07:43,435 --> 00:07:45,850
Speaker 0: in six to eight days when a new one comes.

123
00:07:46,131 --> 00:07:47,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

124
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:47,575
Speaker 0: well one.

125
00:07:47,595 --> 00:07:50,345
Speaker 0: they have to accept the RMA which means they're gonna inspect the motherboard.

126
00:07:50,385 --> 00:07:53,347
Speaker 0: even though I already did I couldn't Find any physical problems with.

127
00:07:53,408 --> 00:08:00,990
Speaker 1: well They probably have better equipment to inspect it and they'll probably if they can get it to boot Then you can get it to boot and it's probably it's the power supply.

128
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:08,855
Speaker 0: so yeah, well from what I look at they only seem to reject an RMA and not just send you a new one if It's physically broken.

129
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:12,250
Speaker 0: and if it's physically broken they won't give you a refund or anything because you broke it.

130
00:08:12,331 --> 00:08:13,506
Speaker 1: Well don't physically break it.

131
00:08:14,023 --> 00:08:20,224
Speaker 0: Yeah Apparently a lot of people with these new Intel chips Will just touch all those pins on the motherboard and ruin them.

132
00:08:20,465 --> 00:08:25,884
Speaker 0: good idea genius Despite the fact that there are like 12 warnings all over saying don't touch anything.

133
00:08:25,944 --> 00:08:26,406
Speaker 0: Don't touch it.

134
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:26,867
Speaker 0: Don't touch it.

135
00:08:26,888 --> 00:08:31,099
Speaker 1: Don't touch it Lol, oh, so just to finish this off.

136
00:08:31,219 --> 00:08:37,090
Speaker 1: I finally found where hidden on the 8-bit website it lists the power supplies that work with the motherboards.

137
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:43,390
Speaker 1: Yep, it's kind of hidden I will admit but your power supply isn't listed with that motherboard.

138
00:08:44,171 --> 00:08:45,836
Speaker 1: Yeah, however, it's pointing that out.

139
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:48,103
Speaker 0: If you look at the list of wattages.

140
00:08:48,303 --> 00:08:55,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are equivalent power supplies and Far weaker power supplies work just fine with this motherboard than the one I've got.

141
00:08:55,296 --> 00:08:59,243
Speaker 1: Yeah but I think those are from companies that make superior power supplies.

142
00:08:59,263 --> 00:09:04,361
Speaker 1: because I see the thing is we just keep The number one stat everyone looks at for a power supply.

143
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:06,409
Speaker 1: is the wattage just like when you look at a CPU.

144
00:09:06,429 --> 00:09:12,721
Speaker 1: look at Megahertz, but I'm beginning to think that nowadays The wattage isn't what really matters and whether it's gonna work or not.

145
00:09:12,761 --> 00:09:18,780
Speaker 1: Like there's probably a 700 watt power supply out there That's not gonna do the trick and there's probably a 300 out there that will.

146
00:09:19,182 --> 00:09:25,526
Speaker 1: so it just it's just too hard for people Alright, so there isn't really tech news this week so much.

147
00:09:25,626 --> 00:09:31,229
Speaker 1: if you haven't noticed Maybe you listen to the most recent episode of twit, which was one of the worst podcasts I ever heard.

148
00:09:32,013 --> 00:09:34,305
Speaker 1: They should really just not make a show and there's no tech news.

149
00:09:34,366 --> 00:09:35,873
Speaker 1: cuz it was so bad I don't know.

150
00:09:35,913 --> 00:09:38,082
Speaker 0: I thought there was plenty of interesting tech news.

151
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,930
Speaker 0: Well, anyway, I have a bit.

152
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,659
Speaker 0: I don't know why they didn't talk about any of it.

153
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know why you listen to twit.

154
00:09:44,072 --> 00:09:44,797
Speaker 1: I don't know either.

155
00:09:45,501 --> 00:09:46,326
Speaker 1: after that episode.

156
00:09:46,346 --> 00:09:46,870
Speaker 1: Maybe I won't.

157
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:57,088
Speaker 1: But a new version of an open source program came out and this is a program I think a lot of people are unfamiliar with and perhaps they should be.

158
00:09:57,658 --> 00:10:05,391
Speaker 1: blender 2.44 came out and this is a piece of software that no it does not grind things up into mush for you to drink or Beat.

159
00:10:05,672 --> 00:10:06,837
Speaker 1: that is that is not what it does.

160
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:09,810
Speaker 1: It does not combine things in any way really.

161
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:19,895
Speaker 1: This is a piece of software that allows you to make things in 3d 3d animations 3d models 3d everything and It is free.

162
00:10:20,338 --> 00:10:21,082
Speaker 1: the story of it.

163
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:24,682
Speaker 1: Is that there was a program I think I forget if it was called blender before.

164
00:10:24,702 --> 00:10:27,143
Speaker 1: it was open source or not, but equivalent.

165
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:34,448
Speaker 1: basically The program blender was made by a closed source company and then the company went down and it.

166
00:10:34,488 --> 00:10:35,708
Speaker 1: basically no one Used this thing.

167
00:10:36,171 --> 00:10:56,270
Speaker 1: So either some open source guys got together and bought it or the people making it gave it up or some Combination of those events happened and this amazing closed source 3d rendering and modeling animation program Was made free free open source and it has been continued to be developed until today and it's actually pretty impressive.

168
00:10:56,431 --> 00:11:10,805
Speaker 1: You if you are someone who needs to do the 3ds like 3d studio max or any Maya or any of those type of things But you don't have mad monies to shell out for those and maybe you want to run the Linux so you don't want to pirate anything.

169
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,029
Speaker 1: Blender exists and you can go get it for free.

170
00:11:14,552 --> 00:11:22,789
Speaker 1: The best part is if you're someone who doesn't even care about 3d modeling But you might want to just poke a program that does that to see what it's like blenders free Why not go for it?

171
00:11:22,971 --> 00:11:31,510
Speaker 0: We could probably do an episode on blender But we'd have to get Emily on because I know pretty much nothing about 3d anything other than what she has told me.

172
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:33,935
Speaker 1: I know how to use AutoCAD Release 13.

173
00:11:33,935 --> 00:11:37,091
Speaker 1: Yeah, which is older than AutoCAD 2000.

174
00:11:37,091 --> 00:11:41,409
Speaker 0: It's actually better than you'd expect at modeling simple things in 3d.

175
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:50,470
Speaker 1: if you give me a physical object or a blueprint or something like that and AutoCAD I can recreate it or make a model of it in time.

176
00:11:50,732 --> 00:11:59,210
Speaker 1: You know, it might take me a while once I got to relearn it because you know But that's what I learned how to do Like if you give me like a machine and mechanical desktop.

177
00:11:59,451 --> 00:12:05,072
Speaker 1: I will have a model of that machine for you and depending on the complexity of the machine in some weeks Maybe.

178
00:12:05,495 --> 00:12:08,450
Speaker 1: but yeah, the thing with blender is that it is very powerful.

179
00:12:08,550 --> 00:12:10,639
Speaker 1: If you look at sample renderings from blender you go.

180
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:13,088
Speaker 1: Wow, that's like better than the first toy story.

181
00:12:13,148 --> 00:12:16,348
Speaker 1: Holy shit That's damn good stuff right there and it is damn good stuff.

182
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:20,168
Speaker 1: But blender is not so easy for the people to use.

183
00:12:20,188 --> 00:12:24,030
Speaker 0: now I don't think it's as bad as the difference between the gimp and Photoshop.

184
00:12:24,251 --> 00:12:24,874
Speaker 1: No, it is not.

185
00:12:25,075 --> 00:12:30,197
Speaker 1: it's not a difference of it's a bad user interface It's that it's a different user.

186
00:12:30,277 --> 00:12:33,087
Speaker 0: Well, that was quite the off-handed jab at the gimp.

187
00:12:33,408 --> 00:12:33,729
Speaker 1: I know.

188
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:36,476
Speaker 0: See the thing with the game.

189
00:12:36,516 --> 00:12:40,136
Speaker 0: I just bring this up because we used to always say yeah the gimp is fine The gimp is fine.

190
00:12:40,318 --> 00:12:41,730
Speaker 0: It's fine for what I'm doing people.

191
00:12:41,971 --> 00:12:47,748
Speaker 0: I didn't use it a lot and I never really use it for anything more complex than resizing an image.

192
00:12:47,848 --> 00:12:50,949
Speaker 1: or possibly I resize images with image magic on the command line.

193
00:12:51,351 --> 00:12:56,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually the gimp to like, you know now that it's like there's a part of an image or something like that Flicker.

194
00:12:56,860 --> 00:13:07,330
Speaker 0: I also do that Yeah But we had a bunch of artists friends over the last several years come over and we try to make them do art for us for various reasons and We didn't have Photoshop.

195
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:22,610
Speaker 0: So they try to use the gimp on either the Mac downstairs or one of our computers and they hated it so much that we looked into it and I tried to do a few slightly more complex things in the gimp and Discovered that it's not just a problem of it's different from Photoshop.

196
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:23,414
Speaker 0: That was.

197
00:13:23,434 --> 00:13:26,510
Speaker 1: my original thinking was oh these people are just so used to Photoshop.

198
00:13:26,671 --> 00:13:36,290
Speaker 1: It's like I use vim every goddamn day and I use SSH and I you know If I try to use Emacs it totally throws me off, but I see other people using Emacs quite well.

199
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:42,368
Speaker 1: So I know it's not a problem with Emacs or vim, but when it comes to the gimp, it's just bad.

200
00:13:42,428 --> 00:13:42,930
Speaker 0: It's counterintuitive.

201
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:51,709
Speaker 1: Well, I mean there are people who can use the gimp quite well, but if you compare a gimp master and a Photoshop master It's really no contest.

202
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:57,990
Speaker 1: Photoshop just has more action and is easier to use to do awesome things.

203
00:13:58,775 --> 00:14:06,488
Speaker 1: alright, so blender if you are Looking for some 3d rendering modeling animating action for free if you ever want to try it.

204
00:14:06,528 --> 00:14:07,170
Speaker 1: see what it's like.

205
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:13,143
Speaker 1: Maybe you're you know in high school You're thinking about maybe doing that college or something or you're a poor college student.

206
00:14:13,223 --> 00:14:15,763
Speaker 1: Who knows blender free get it Why not?

207
00:14:16,452 --> 00:14:24,766
Speaker 0: So there was an article on slashdot last week and it bothered me enough to where I actually Delicious it and waited until today tonight where I could talk about it.

208
00:14:24,806 --> 00:14:26,475
Speaker 0: Whoa Now the head.

209
00:14:26,676 --> 00:14:29,230
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna talk about the slashdot right up in the headline.

210
00:14:29,330 --> 00:14:33,503
Speaker 0: I didn't even bother reading the the stupid Harvard professors paper.

211
00:14:33,523 --> 00:14:40,669
Speaker 0: I like how I said stupid Harvard professor But I think you'll see why I held this opinion once I get into this a bit.

212
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:42,540
Speaker 0: But the headline was Harvard.

213
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,249
Speaker 0: prof says computers need to forget.

214
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,422
Speaker 1: Computers need to forget quote.

215
00:14:47,684 --> 00:14:55,873
Speaker 0: a Harvard professor Argues that too much information is being retained by computers and the machines need to learn how to forget things as humans always have quotes.

216
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:06,330
Speaker 0: if whenever we if whatever we do can be held against us years later if All of our impulsive comments are preserved they can easily be combined into a composite picture of ourselves.

217
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:12,685
Speaker 0: further quotes afraid of how our words and actions may be perceived years later and taken out of context.

218
00:15:13,167 --> 00:15:14,230
Speaker 0: the lack of forgetting is.

219
00:15:14,711 --> 00:15:19,330
Speaker 0: I love that grammar right there may prompt us to speak less freely and openly.

220
00:15:21,331 --> 00:15:22,093
Speaker 0: Before

221
00:15:22,113 --> 00:15:23,438
Speaker 1: before Wow

222
00:15:23,579 --> 00:15:35,129
Speaker 0: I get into my specific complaints with this professor and before I get into my Much more strongly held opinions regarding people like him and my opinions regarding age and its relation to these opinions

223
00:15:36,473 --> 00:15:37,074
Speaker 1: I

224
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:44,756
Speaker 0: would like to point out that John Gabriel's greater internet fuckwad theory very Directly counters this.

225
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:53,470
Speaker 0: he's saying that if people's words are kept online And there's records of what people say that somehow people will be less open in their opinions.

226
00:15:53,993 --> 00:16:04,664
Speaker 0: I point out that the vast majority of people on the internet say absolutely horrendous things to each other 24/7 regardless of if anyone actually that argument.

227
00:16:04,764 --> 00:16:13,110
Speaker 1: while it holds some water with me I think the appropriate counter to it would be that the John Gabriel's greater internet fuckwad theory includes anonymity.

228
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,220
Speaker 0: Anonymity is easily had.

229
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,888
Speaker 1: anonymity is easily had.

230
00:16:16,928 --> 00:16:20,499
Speaker 1: however Imagine a world in which there was no anonymity.

231
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:24,330
Speaker 1: would his this professor's crackpot theories be correct?

232
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:31,770
Speaker 1: See now people would restrain themselves without anonymity, or do you think the current internet free speech?

233
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:34,205
Speaker 1: Everyone's saying whatever the fuck they want would continue.

234
00:16:34,588 --> 00:16:50,257
Speaker 0: see now Here's the point where I really want to dig into this guy because this opinion has been Expressed in my presence many times in my life and without fail it has been expressed by people who were very much older than me and Specifically in a lot of my jobs.

235
00:16:50,538 --> 00:16:58,096
Speaker 0: a lot of the older people who work to these companies or various places Would go so far as to refuse or avoid Responding to anything.

236
00:16:58,156 --> 00:17:17,910
Speaker 0: I sent them an email or in writing whatever possible And they went out of their way to do business over the phone or in person Because they didn't like the fact that if they had an email or a document or a memo Then whatever they promised to do or whatever we'd agreed on or whatever They said was now recorded and could be referred to later.

237
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:19,797
Speaker 0: And they were so afraid of that.

238
00:17:20,159 --> 00:17:22,769
Speaker 1: maybe you shouldn't say something you're not gonna do.

239
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:31,650
Speaker 0: See it seems that people who are afraid of computers retaining information are the kinds of people who are especially like he says here.

240
00:17:31,991 --> 00:17:41,010
Speaker 0: You know if all of our impulsive comments are preserved and be combined later into a composite picture of ourselves All of those impulsive comments are indeed a composite picture of ourselves.

241
00:17:41,472 --> 00:17:52,330
Speaker 0: So if you say all these things on the internet or in your life or all over the place And then you don't want anyone to remember what you said Why did you say it also?

242
00:17:53,871 --> 00:18:04,610
Speaker 1: The only people who should be afraid of the things they say creating composite picture of themselves are people who are ugly not ugly Physically looking though they may be if they're putting pictures on Craigslist or something.

243
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:15,640
Speaker 1: But if you if you're an ugly person on the inside and that comes out when you say things on the internet And you don't want anyone to realize you're an ugly person You should I just shut up or stop being an ugly person

244
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:18,370
Speaker 0: like let's say you're the kind of person who loses your temper really?

245
00:18:18,470 --> 00:18:20,156
Speaker 0: Easily and you lash out at people.

246
00:18:20,537 --> 00:18:25,655
Speaker 0: so you're on the internet and very frequent frequently in your internet conversations You lash out at people.

247
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:32,218
Speaker 0: well now me who is trying to learn about you can see wow He's short-tempered and lashes out at people duly noted.

248
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:42,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, this guy's this professor is basically saying hey Let's create a world in which we know less in which things are shittier in which it is harder to make good decisions.

249
00:18:42,311 --> 00:18:43,118
Speaker 1: Yes, that way.

250
00:18:43,158 --> 00:18:44,490
Speaker 1: It'll be more interesting.

251
00:18:45,215 --> 00:18:47,390
Speaker 0: See it's a very very simply sum up my position.

252
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:55,544
Speaker 0: I'm of the mind that in any case possible in the world More information is better because information is not evil.

253
00:18:55,765 --> 00:19:04,430
Speaker 0: the only problems that arrive from Information are when evil people use it for evil reasons or when people take information and try to obscure it with no good cause.

254
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:14,847
Speaker 0: Yep, I say no good cause because I do agree there are situations where it is good to at least temporarily or for whatever important Reason keep information somewhat under wraps.

255
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:22,208
Speaker 0: yes Well, you don't tell anyone your password, or if there's a military operation you don't post it on Craigslist moments before.

256
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:24,177
Speaker 1: yes That's also a bad idea.

257
00:19:24,478 --> 00:19:29,739
Speaker 0: Yes, if the government has a secret plan to invade I don't know Australia, and they're gonna do it tomorrow.

258
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,008
Speaker 0: I'm fine with them keeping someone quiet for another 24 hours.

259
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:40,061
Speaker 1: however There is way too much information that people attempt to keep secret.

260
00:19:40,382 --> 00:19:43,530
Speaker 1: that is absolutely unnecessary and in fact harmful.

261
00:19:43,732 --> 00:19:52,390
Speaker 1: Maybe not harmful in that they're keeping it But harmful in that the releasing the information would be a benefit and thus they are preventing benefit if not causing harm.

262
00:19:52,852 --> 00:20:05,799
Speaker 0: Now what's funny is I run into this very often in my life And I can remember two separate instances at RIT Because now pretty much no one even thinks everyone logs their chats or at least I assume they do But pretty much right from the moment.

263
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:16,598
Speaker 0: I started using instant messaging when I got ICQ God a fucking long time ago when I was in high school back before instant aim And there was really no instant messaging.

264
00:20:16,638 --> 00:20:20,554
Speaker 0: this was brand new and I saw hey I can log Conversations.

265
00:20:21,057 --> 00:20:29,929
Speaker 0: so I set it up to log every single conversation I had online ever and in fact sitting next to me in my hand right now is a hard drive a broken hard drive.

266
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:35,410
Speaker 0: the Hard drive is fine the controller card on the outside is broken, but there's no way we can get the information off of there.

267
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:36,456
Speaker 0: Well without a bunch of money.

268
00:20:36,657 --> 00:20:37,924
Speaker 1: You're like thousands of dollars.

269
00:20:37,964 --> 00:20:53,838
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I'm ever rich I'll probably pay to get the data off because on this hard drive is the transcript of every single chat and email conversation I had from 1997 until two years into college and Once I got to RIT I continued doing this.

270
00:20:54,120 --> 00:21:01,990
Speaker 0: I remember one time a few years ago before this hard drive died I was sitting around with everyone and I pulled up the very first thing Scott had ever said to me online.

271
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:07,029
Speaker 0: It was the first conversation we had ever had and the Internet's yeah, well the first real conversation beyond.

272
00:21:07,069 --> 00:21:09,381
Speaker 0: hi I'm a guy who likes anime.

273
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:09,763
Speaker 0: Hi.

274
00:21:09,864 --> 00:21:14,459
Speaker 1: I also enjoy anime Had a real conversation in person and before being on.

275
00:21:14,539 --> 00:21:20,196
Speaker 0: I am but barely because this was pretty much the second week of school on Monday right before Gracie's.

276
00:21:20,457 --> 00:21:24,330
Speaker 0: Oh knows yeah, yeah, but yeah, so I started logging everything.

277
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:32,339
Speaker 0: I remember a couple people who I will not name thought this was creepy and odd and in fact They said that I was acting like a J Edgar Hoover.

278
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,285
Speaker 0: and why do I want to record everything?

279
00:21:34,747 --> 00:21:35,530
Speaker 0: one of these people?

280
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:39,270
Speaker 0: Sometime later that year I had an argument with online.

281
00:21:39,772 --> 00:21:44,850
Speaker 0: I then had another argument with in person and the person said that they did not say something previously.

282
00:21:45,292 --> 00:21:49,870
Speaker 0: Well, uh, I pulled up my chat log and sure enough he had said exactly that.

283
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:51,853
Speaker 0: he said exactly what I had said he said.

284
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:59,762
Speaker 0: so I pulled it up and I've showed it to him and continued the argument and He considered this to be some crazy horrible thing.

285
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:04,501
Speaker 0: that how dare I refer to a previous Conversation with proof that he had said something.

286
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:06,370
Speaker 0: How dare I prove the truth?

287
00:22:07,413 --> 00:22:11,307
Speaker 0: How dare you how dare I record a conversation I had with someone?

288
00:22:11,588 --> 00:22:34,408
Speaker 1: oh no Yeah, basically the way I see it is anyone who thinks like this Harvard professor is someone with regrets or shame and as far as I'm concerned anything that makes it harder for people with regrets and shame to get along is a good thing because Part of one factor in the perfect world of Scott is a world in which no one has any regrets or any shame.

289
00:22:34,589 --> 00:22:43,448
Speaker 0: like me Plus without these paper trails I'd never get anything done at any of my jobs because a lot of people just won't do things Unless I have proof that they said they'd do it.

290
00:22:44,011 --> 00:22:46,037
Speaker 1: Also, just think about just I am.

291
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:49,527
Speaker 1: logs rim sends me a link yesterday if that's not in my history.

292
00:22:49,547 --> 00:22:52,255
Speaker 1: It's How am I supposed to find it again?

293
00:22:52,275 --> 00:22:59,558
Speaker 1: It's it's necessary just for functioning let alone, you know getting people who are stupid Just for my personal usefulness.

294
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:07,010
Speaker 1: I need to keep all the information that I communicate Somewhere to refer to it at a later time because it's useful to me.

295
00:23:07,191 --> 00:23:17,049
Speaker 1: there's a reason someone told me something a reason I told something to someone and If I if it wasn't important, I probably didn't say it and if it was important I need to know it again at some point.

296
00:23:17,512 --> 00:23:21,829
Speaker 0: So I guess I suppose to be warned that I am one of those people and I think it's a very good thing to do.

297
00:23:22,371 --> 00:23:26,164
Speaker 0: Who keeps a record of every single written conversation?

298
00:23:26,245 --> 00:23:26,967
Speaker 0: I have ever.

299
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:30,269
Speaker 0: I have every email I ever send and Gmail is making that very easy.

300
00:23:31,012 --> 00:23:34,160
Speaker 1: Also, you might note that in our forum light is the same way.

301
00:23:34,281 --> 00:23:41,762
Speaker 1: anything that has ever said in our forum will be kept probably forever Yeah, as long as digital data can be stored and an apocalypse does not happen.

302
00:23:41,922 --> 00:23:50,545
Speaker 1: Yep barring direct intervention by law enforcement yep, and Not only that even when we delete posts on the forum, they're still in the database.

303
00:23:50,565 --> 00:23:51,589
Speaker 1: Just no one can see him.

304
00:23:52,373 --> 00:23:54,567
Speaker 1: So watch out don't say anything.

305
00:23:54,587 --> 00:24:03,376
Speaker 0: you regret Things of the day.

306
00:24:03,917 --> 00:24:10,562
Speaker 0: so you all know our James Randi who we revere as a minor deity Minor deity police you do.

307
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,069
Speaker 1: I think he's a cranky old man.

308
00:24:12,371 --> 00:24:15,020
Speaker 0: He I think he is probably an awesome cranky old man.

309
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:20,919
Speaker 0: James Randi is probably the god of Cremadines, uh, yes granted.

310
00:24:21,019 --> 00:24:26,397
Speaker 0: I I do not use that in a pre-charted sense because James Randi is still the man But he's very old.

311
00:24:26,658 --> 00:24:28,466
Speaker 0: I mean he was friends with Houdini.

312
00:24:28,947 --> 00:24:31,762
Speaker 0: That's old Yeah, but basically real.

313
00:24:31,782 --> 00:24:39,230
Speaker 0: briefly he goes around the world Proving that people who claim to have psychic powers or magic powers or ghosts or whatever are full of bullshit.

314
00:24:39,692 --> 00:24:41,460
Speaker 0: And he has a million dollar prize

315
00:24:41,802 --> 00:24:42,666
Speaker 1: where he used to have a $10,000 prize

316
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:53,157
Speaker 0: Yep, where if anyone ever can provide any evidence of any supernatural or paranormal phenomenon at all Even the simplest thing ever

317
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:54,200
Speaker 1: you immediately

318
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:57,169
Speaker 0: win the million dollars that he actually has ready to give you.

319
00:24:58,232 --> 00:25:01,329
Speaker 0: And in all these years No one has even come close.

320
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:02,293
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

321
00:25:02,313 --> 00:25:08,273
Speaker 1: what generally happens is people say they have some sort of magic or something and James Randi says, all right I'll give you a million dollars.

322
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:15,292
Speaker 1: Let me see it and they'll either say no or you don't have a million dollars or something like that or They'll say all right Let's do it.

323
00:25:15,452 --> 00:25:16,135
Speaker 1: and then they do it.

324
00:25:16,235 --> 00:25:21,080
Speaker 1: and then they're like they make up excuses and they say Randy's a bullshit and no one Has ever done it.

325
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:23,377
Speaker 0: Yep And the thing is I mean it's not like.

326
00:25:23,718 --> 00:25:26,750
Speaker 0: he just says like maybe a psychic would come and do it and he'd be like.

327
00:25:26,971 --> 00:25:27,813
Speaker 0: I don't believe that.

328
00:25:28,174 --> 00:25:33,390
Speaker 0: he actually proves pretty much straight out that the person didn't have powers and he doesn't even have the final call.

329
00:25:33,951 --> 00:25:40,833
Speaker 0: Usually if another scientist says yep statistically this guy did it then Randi would have to give it to him and he couldn't just back Out.

330
00:25:41,297 --> 00:25:42,467
Speaker 0: but no one's ever won it.

331
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:51,862
Speaker 0: Well, he's been doing this for a long time and here's a video from some talk show from back in the like the proto Culture days of television.

332
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:53,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

333
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:55,621
Speaker 1: It's got Bob Barker and it looks like the price is right.

334
00:25:55,661 --> 00:25:56,946
Speaker 1: set but it's not.

335
00:25:56,986 --> 00:25:57,790
Speaker 1: the price is right

336
00:25:58,291 --> 00:26:03,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically it's a video showing him completely owning this

337
00:26:03,564 --> 00:26:03,825
Speaker 1: really

338
00:26:03,885 --> 00:26:06,601
Speaker 0: kind of a tool guy named James Hydric,

339
00:26:06,987 --> 00:26:15,796
Speaker 1: yeah basically this guy says he trained with a Chinese master and learned psychic powers and that he can move a pencil and Turn pages in a phone book without touching them.

340
00:26:15,897 --> 00:26:16,037
Speaker 0: Now.

341
00:26:16,117 --> 00:26:20,270
Speaker 0: The guy reminds me a lot of a guy from Napoleon Dynamite.

342
00:26:20,351 --> 00:26:26,320
Speaker 0: He's just kind of this really dumb With an ugly haircut and he's obviously a charlatan.

343
00:26:26,521 --> 00:26:29,530
Speaker 0: There is no doubt that he's a charlatan a fake a fraud a phony.

344
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:30,736
Speaker 0: I'm gonna say all those things.

345
00:26:30,776 --> 00:26:33,669
Speaker 0: Penn and Teller are afraid to say cuz I don't care if this guy sues me.

346
00:26:34,111 --> 00:26:36,457
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's a scammer.

347
00:26:36,899 --> 00:26:47,776
Speaker 0: So uh his trick was oh, he'll use psychic powers to move a pencil But he just blows on it and then he uses psychic powers to turn pages in a phone book But he just blows on it.

348
00:26:48,338 --> 00:26:56,109
Speaker 1: and the way that James Randi shows that he doesn't have psychic power Like I thought Randy was gonna put like a little plastic wall around the phone book Yeah, and I was like up.

349
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:59,390
Speaker 1: No, the guy will make an excuse saying it blocks his psychic power or something.

350
00:26:59,812 --> 00:27:03,710
Speaker 1: But James Randi has a much better idea than putting up a plastic wall around it.

351
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:14,170
Speaker 0: Yeah And it's really kind of pathetic how badly this guy gets owned though It does kind of bother me how polite everyone is to the guy even after he's been straight-up shown to be a fraud.

352
00:27:14,491 --> 00:27:22,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing that really got me watching this video is I wasn't worried You know, I wasn't in suspense of ooh, is he gonna be able to do it or not?

353
00:27:22,127 --> 00:27:24,821
Speaker 1: That was not a Obviously he was going to fail.

354
00:27:24,862 --> 00:27:26,229
Speaker 1: There was no question about it.

355
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:37,214
Speaker 1: the question I had was is he going to blow and thus reveal his charlatan ways or is he going to refrain from blowing and Make some excuse up.

356
00:27:37,635 --> 00:27:38,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're not gonna answer that one.

357
00:27:38,819 --> 00:27:39,863
Speaker 0: You'll have to watch it yourself.

358
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:40,585
Speaker 1: Also.

359
00:27:40,886 --> 00:27:47,970
Speaker 1: The other question is There is a way out where he could just admit that he blew or whatever and take out the honorable path?

360
00:27:48,111 --> 00:27:50,123
Speaker 1: But that's pretty unlikely.

361
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:51,069
Speaker 1: I didn't expect it to happen.

362
00:27:51,270 --> 00:28:02,772
Speaker 0: Now the funny thing is they have three quote-unquote impartial judges for all the judges and one of whom has is a professor of Parapsychology, which is another word for Idiot.

363
00:28:02,953 --> 00:28:03,273
Speaker 1: Yeah.

364
00:28:03,915 --> 00:28:05,539
Speaker 1: Oh, I study psychic powers.

365
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,224
Speaker 1: So you study nothing because they don't exist.

366
00:28:07,505 --> 00:28:09,450
Speaker 1: That's like if I studied fairies.

367
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:10,318
Speaker 1: Guess what?

368
00:28:10,338 --> 00:28:11,107
Speaker 1: There are no fairies.

369
00:28:11,531 --> 00:28:16,430
Speaker 1: Maybe if I was a liberal arts teacher studying fairy literature or something like that, that would be okay.

370
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:26,364
Speaker 0: But see now I would have nothing wrong with the title of parapsychology if the people who studied Parapsychology went around just debunking it or well actually investigated.

371
00:28:26,405 --> 00:28:33,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you actually honestly Investigated psychic phenomena you would every time you would go and investigate and say nope.

372
00:28:33,666 --> 00:28:34,127
Speaker 1: Nothing here.

373
00:28:34,308 --> 00:28:35,010
Speaker 1: No, nothing here.

374
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:40,310
Speaker 0: No, luckily in here this charlatan was such a charlatan and was so bad at what he was doing.

375
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, this isn't even like a high quality charlatan.

376
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:47,306
Speaker 1: This isn't the kind of people we have now like the those psychics on TV who talked with the dead.

377
00:28:47,346 --> 00:28:54,446
Speaker 1: or this guy was pretty Bad and he was not prepared to be Punned so thoroughly and I think that's part of why he agreed to be on the show.

378
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,041
Speaker 1: a better charlatan would not have agreed to appear.

379
00:28:57,523 --> 00:29:02,630
Speaker 0: and even the Parapsychology judge was like yeah, you don't have psychic powers.

380
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:15,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this guy was such a milquetoast little me that he went so far as to say However, I do believe that psychic powers do exist and a reasonable man would But he says it in a really halting nervous way and he's just kind of a twat.

381
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:16,650
Speaker 1: Yeah total twat.

382
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:19,300
Speaker 0: I've been calling people twats quite a bit lately.

383
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,090
Speaker 1: I realize you got to come up with new words every now and again.

384
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,989
Speaker 1: You got to recycle the vocabulary, but I'm not sure if I mean.

385
00:29:25,592 --> 00:29:30,090
Speaker 0: It's definitely a kind of British thing to call someone a twat, but it's not used so often in the u.s.

386
00:29:30,451 --> 00:29:31,735
Speaker 0: But I wonder if I'm using cuz.

387
00:29:31,776 --> 00:29:32,438
Speaker 0: Emily pointed out.

388
00:29:32,819 --> 00:29:35,970
Speaker 0: are you using the word twat the way a British person would use it?

389
00:29:36,211 --> 00:29:39,010
Speaker 0: Would you call someone like that a twat or would you use another word?

390
00:29:39,351 --> 00:29:40,536
Speaker 0: I'll have to defer to the movies.

391
00:29:40,576 --> 00:29:49,286
Speaker 1: You should see people or because I don't know All right, well I got a pretty cool thing of the day here that I discovered.

392
00:29:49,487 --> 00:29:58,982
Speaker 1: oh really yep You know how you listen to a song from say the 80s or the 90s or whatever and it always has some sort of Synthesized sound and you always hear these synthesized noises, right?

393
00:29:59,323 --> 00:30:00,045
Speaker 1: And you're like, huh?

394
00:30:00,286 --> 00:30:01,510
Speaker 1: I hear these cool noises.

395
00:30:01,631 --> 00:30:03,480
Speaker 1: I wonder what machine makes those noises.

396
00:30:03,782 --> 00:30:05,350
Speaker 1: I wonder how you use that machine.

397
00:30:05,732 --> 00:30:06,053
Speaker 1: It's not.

398
00:30:06,113 --> 00:30:11,703
Speaker 1: it's obviously not a musical instrument that you know is like a. You know guitar or violin.

399
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:12,850
Speaker 1: that requires lots of practice.

400
00:30:12,991 --> 00:30:18,210
Speaker 1: It's a machine with buttons and dials that somehow creates music and you want to know how those machines work.

401
00:30:18,672 --> 00:30:27,170
Speaker 1: well one very popular one of those machines is The Roland 909 music composer and it's a pretty cool machine.

402
00:30:27,331 --> 00:30:36,964
Speaker 1: it has like drums in it and it's got all sorts of other cool stuff going on and This machine is not a machine that I guess is easy to come by.

403
00:30:37,044 --> 00:30:42,370
Speaker 1: it might be I don't know cuz I don't really know Much about it, but I don't imagine it would be that easy to buy one.

404
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:45,470
Speaker 1: Maybe they're on eBay who knows but they don't sell them in the music store.

405
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:51,090
Speaker 1: They sell newer fancier more modern expensive machines that are possibly more complicated maybe even superior.

406
00:30:51,552 --> 00:30:54,585
Speaker 1: But this is a popular one that if you listen to it, you'll go.

407
00:30:54,786 --> 00:30:55,790
Speaker 1: Oh, I know that noise.

408
00:30:55,972 --> 00:31:13,812
Speaker 1: I've heard that noise and like a bajillion songs And if you want to learn how to use this machine or just play around with it and see how it works some guy Basically emulated the entire machine and flash and if you go to this web page You'll see the machine and you can click on it and manipulate all of its buttons and dials and generate all the sounds it can Generate

409
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:14,636
Speaker 0: hot shit.

410
00:31:14,717 --> 00:31:15,722
Speaker 0: I thought you were just gonna go.

411
00:31:15,742 --> 00:31:16,848
Speaker 0: I didn't even look at what you're thinking.

412
00:31:16,868 --> 00:31:17,250
Speaker 0: the day was.

413
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,978
Speaker 0: I thought you were just gonna talk about the machine.

414
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:19,902
Speaker 1: No, look right here.

415
00:31:20,203 --> 00:31:23,969
Speaker 0: Look not bad I'm gonna have to play with this as soon as I finish.

416
00:31:24,252 --> 00:31:26,669
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm pushing the button to play the demo reel right now.

417
00:31:27,171 --> 00:31:35,862
Speaker 0: So we've been asking a lot for show ideas for the last several weeks now and Often many of you have said things along the lines of computer security.

418
00:31:36,023 --> 00:31:38,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of you are like, how do I not get spywares?

419
00:31:39,451 --> 00:31:41,128
Speaker 1: How do I set up my firewalls?

420
00:31:41,932 --> 00:31:42,305
Speaker 1: How do I?

421
00:31:43,171 --> 00:31:44,969
Speaker 1: Make it so I can hack into people?

422
00:31:45,451 --> 00:31:53,316
Speaker 0: yep, and also a lot of people have asked about very specific things like wireless security or like how WEP works or why WEP is Insecure all sorts of things like that.

423
00:31:53,757 --> 00:31:57,670
Speaker 0: and our how computers work series has been very popular among all of you.

424
00:31:58,091 --> 00:32:19,210
Speaker 0: so we decided to add computer security to the whole mix and we realized that pretty much all of those topics each warrant individual shows and Furthermore we really can't talk about it at all without doing some sort of overview because what computer security or IT Security actually are is quite a bit more involved in complex than a lot of you might realize.

425
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:22,744
Speaker 1: Yes, I just told you how to set up a firewall.

426
00:32:22,945 --> 00:32:24,170
Speaker 1: that basically wouldn't mean dick.

427
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:24,893
Speaker 1: There are many.

428
00:32:25,114 --> 00:32:28,710
Speaker 1: all those things like firewalls and SSH is and encryptions and webs.

429
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:29,855
Speaker 1: those are just tools.

430
00:32:30,216 --> 00:32:36,609
Speaker 1: the same way that a lock is a tool or that a I don't know a low jack is a tool as a security device.

431
00:32:37,232 --> 00:32:43,350
Speaker 1: Just knowing how to use the security device or how to deploy it or how to configure it is not enough to make you secure.

432
00:32:43,791 --> 00:32:47,343
Speaker 1: Knowing how to use a lock and key on your front door isn't enough.

433
00:32:47,484 --> 00:32:49,150
Speaker 1: that it's not gonna do anything for you.

434
00:32:49,250 --> 00:33:04,402
Speaker 1: you need to learn the basic principles of security in general and then the further principles of electronic digital security and then you can start to learn how those tools can be a help to you in your quest to Protect yourself and others.

435
00:33:04,684 --> 00:33:10,568
Speaker 0: and to put it lightly There are a lot more factors you would probably even think about considering when it comes to security.

436
00:33:10,588 --> 00:33:12,053
Speaker 1: their factors I don't even consider.

437
00:33:12,073 --> 00:33:19,311
Speaker 0: I mean I take a security at its base is really just a combination of data security and physical Security.

438
00:33:19,672 --> 00:33:46,110
Speaker 0: I say data security separately because data security is all the data all the stuff you're trying to protect from either being read By someone you don't want to read it all the things you're trying to protect from someone writing over changing getting access to anything like that and Physical security is just the fact that usually very high-powered servers very expensive You don't want anyone to steal them break them or get access to them, which then also compromises the data security.

439
00:33:46,572 --> 00:33:48,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you could have a server right.

440
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:57,190
Speaker 1: let's say we have a server in our house Right and we make a billion firewalls that are all perfectly configured and unbreakable and we have every kind of encryption in the world.

441
00:33:57,351 --> 00:34:01,850
Speaker 1: So quantum encryption, it's the craziest technology security imaginable.

442
00:34:02,131 --> 00:34:06,850
Speaker 1: We don't have wireless everything is locked down so tight and we leave the front door to the house open.

443
00:34:07,492 --> 00:34:10,222
Speaker 1: Oh shit, that all stuff was all a waste.

444
00:34:10,322 --> 00:34:10,905
Speaker 1: We're smart.

445
00:34:11,387 --> 00:34:12,190
Speaker 1: Oh, you're so smart.

446
00:34:13,172 --> 00:34:15,489
Speaker 1: Someone just walked into our house took the computer and walked out.

447
00:34:15,951 --> 00:34:24,062
Speaker 0: Yep, because before we go I mean one of the biggest problems in computer data IT security is the human factor and we can talk about fact.

448
00:34:24,081 --> 00:34:25,848
Speaker 1: the human factor is the number one thing.

449
00:34:25,888 --> 00:34:28,016
Speaker 1: if you don't lock down The human factor nothing else matters.

450
00:34:28,178 --> 00:34:34,185
Speaker 0: Yep human error and human issues Account for the vast majority of actual computer security.

451
00:34:34,245 --> 00:34:37,074
Speaker 0: I would say 90% easily, I mean it depends.

452
00:34:37,396 --> 00:34:44,257
Speaker 0: part of the problem is that a lot of industries are very tight-lipped about when they are compromised and how They were compromised for obvious reasons.

453
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:58,349
Speaker 0: So it's not like there's a lot of hard data as to what happens But the majority of data breaches are caused by users either not following security protocols Following bad security protocols or more importantly just being stupid.

454
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:02,197
Speaker 1: Human security is all about one thing it's about trust.

455
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:11,868
Speaker 1: you have people and You trust people a certain amount and the more you trust someone the more you allow them to do or you more Things you put in their hands.

456
00:35:11,888 --> 00:35:19,265
Speaker 1: and the way to fail for sure at Having good security is to trust the wrong people or to trust people the wrong amount.

457
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:26,768
Speaker 1: if you trust people who are more Trustworthy not enough then they can't help you and if you trust people who are not trustworthy too much They will fuck you.

458
00:35:27,252 --> 00:35:36,605
Speaker 0: You see it's all a matter of compromise because if you've graphed it on one end of a graph You've got accessibility and usefulness of the computer of the data being able to get to it.

459
00:35:36,625 --> 00:35:38,834
Speaker 0: do stuff to it on the other end You've got security.

460
00:35:39,377 --> 00:35:40,503
Speaker 0: I can make a 100% secure server.

461
00:35:42,133 --> 00:35:47,669
Speaker 0: All I would have to do is run it in my room Not connect it to the internet and sit there with it all the time.

462
00:35:48,051 --> 00:35:54,480
Speaker 0: No one can get access to it short of killing me and no one Remotely can get any access to it because there's no network whatsoever.

463
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:57,430
Speaker 0: However, I do point out that this server is not doing anything.

464
00:35:57,892 --> 00:36:00,610
Speaker 1: Yes, this is actually a fundamental principle of security.

465
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:09,825
Speaker 1: That is almost always true and that the more you increase how secure something is the greater difficulty it is to actually use the thing.

466
00:36:10,127 --> 00:36:13,057
Speaker 1: for example My house it has a lock on the front door.

467
00:36:13,498 --> 00:36:17,730
Speaker 1: that makes me waste like 10 seconds opening the door when I get home.

468
00:36:18,151 --> 00:36:21,343
Speaker 1: My house is more secure, but I now suffer.

469
00:36:21,825 --> 00:36:22,005
Speaker 0: Yep.

470
00:36:22,025 --> 00:36:23,210
Speaker 0: So we want that was more secure.

471
00:36:23,652 --> 00:36:26,426
Speaker 0: Say we put a gigantic portcullis in front of the door.

472
00:36:27,029 --> 00:36:30,870
Speaker 0: now It takes us five minutes to get the door open, but the door is much more secure.

473
00:36:31,051 --> 00:36:34,428
Speaker 1: Let's say I have a drawbridge a portcullis and then a giant lock.

474
00:36:34,709 --> 00:36:41,561
Speaker 1: now it takes me a half hour to get into my house and No one can get into my house pretty much without bombs or a battering ram.

475
00:36:41,601 --> 00:36:44,670
Speaker 1: That is mighty large and metal, but I'm secure.

476
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,920
Speaker 1: It's just a pain in the ass for me.

477
00:36:47,061 --> 00:36:49,090
Speaker 1: Well, the same thing is true with computers.

478
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,234
Speaker 1: You want to be more secure?

479
00:36:50,475 --> 00:36:53,728
Speaker 1: You need a longer more complicated harder to remember password.

480
00:36:53,989 --> 00:36:56,777
Speaker 0: Yep I mean think about wireless is a good example.

481
00:36:57,179 --> 00:37:08,457
Speaker 0: by default if you want a wireless access point or wireless internet to work great Just plug it in turn off all the security set it up automatically and if you want to get online Your computer is already online.

482
00:37:08,718 --> 00:37:11,066
Speaker 0: If you have a wireless card, it just finds it and you're online.

483
00:37:11,368 --> 00:37:12,030
Speaker 0: No trouble at all.

484
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's as easy as connecting to wireless at a coffee shop.

485
00:37:15,401 --> 00:37:18,290
Speaker 0: It's just wide open, but now anyone can connect to it.

486
00:37:18,571 --> 00:37:19,635
Speaker 0: So you want to secure it a little bit.

487
00:37:19,675 --> 00:37:21,402
Speaker 0: you put on your web, whatever.

488
00:37:21,443 --> 00:37:23,230
Speaker 0: you turn off broadcasting your SSID.

489
00:37:23,915 --> 00:37:25,650
Speaker 0: Now you have to go a little bit further.

490
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:28,220
Speaker 0: You have to configure your web stuff to make sure it'll work.

491
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,388
Speaker 0: know the SSID and then you can connect.

492
00:37:30,448 --> 00:37:34,850
Speaker 0: it adds more difficulty But even then it's not totally secure because WEP is broken.

493
00:37:35,171 --> 00:37:43,407
Speaker 0: So you got to go with WEP or something else and every layer of security you add the more Inconvenience you were adding to any users who were trying to use that resource.

494
00:37:43,468 --> 00:37:47,869
Speaker 1: Yep Sometimes there are ways to add security without act.

495
00:37:48,331 --> 00:37:53,510
Speaker 1: Add real security without causing a great deal more difficulty and those are usually better solutions.

496
00:37:54,012 --> 00:37:55,841
Speaker 1: There are also ways to add security.

497
00:37:56,082 --> 00:38:01,147
Speaker 1: that only in a little bit of security But making things a lot harder for everyone and those are generally bad solutions.

498
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:10,096
Speaker 0: Yep Now there's also the issue that it's a really multifaceted problem because on one hand most people when they think about computer security They only think about one thing.

499
00:38:10,598 --> 00:38:13,010
Speaker 0: I don't want those evil hackers getting into my computer.

500
00:38:13,352 --> 00:38:16,470
Speaker 0: So they set up a personal firewall or maybe they're behind a net.

501
00:38:16,751 --> 00:38:26,030
Speaker 0: Maybe they run antivirus to make sure they didn't pick up some sort of Trojan or whatever and they try to secure themselves from people getting into their computer from the outside and accessing their data.

502
00:38:26,511 --> 00:38:30,261
Speaker 0: That is one tiny part of individual computer security.

503
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:33,690
Speaker 0: because alright, so you're the only person who uses your computer.

504
00:38:34,091 --> 00:38:38,869
Speaker 0: So the only threats you have to worry about are threats from the outside threats from people trying to get in.

505
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:44,890
Speaker 0: What if you share a computer or you have a house with multiple people living in it in the case of the latter?

506
00:38:45,331 --> 00:38:47,210
Speaker 0: Now you also have to worry about the physical security.

507
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:52,690
Speaker 0: Sure, if you lived alone You can just leave your computer on and unlocked and use it whatever you want as long as your house is physically.

508
00:38:52,730 --> 00:38:53,095
Speaker 1: Yeah,

509
00:38:53,419 --> 00:38:59,411
Speaker 0: but now I live with Scott So I have to lock my computer to make sure that he can't just walk into my room and access it and must with my Data,

510
00:38:59,692 --> 00:39:04,270
Speaker 1: it's not that I'm evil that rim thinks that I'm gonna come and erase his hard drive or anything like that.

511
00:39:04,774 --> 00:39:06,330
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of common sense.

512
00:39:06,350 --> 00:39:07,874
Speaker 1: I Lock my computer.

513
00:39:07,914 --> 00:39:11,910
Speaker 1: to do I if I left it unlocked one day would rim go in there and muscle with my shit?

514
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:15,289
Speaker 1: Probably not probably not but I do it anyway, cuz I'm not a fool.

515
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:18,510
Speaker 1: It's the same reason I have a password on my computer at all.

516
00:39:18,592 --> 00:39:26,543
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean if I you know cuz no one comes into this house that I know whatever comes into this house that I think Would go around my computer and mess it up.

517
00:39:26,825 --> 00:39:27,590
Speaker 1: pretty much nobody.

518
00:39:28,052 --> 00:39:33,437
Speaker 1: But I still lock it down and I no one knows the password for me and no one can use my computer But me is it?

519
00:39:33,538 --> 00:39:34,807
Speaker 1: it's the way it goes.

520
00:39:34,827 --> 00:39:37,158
Speaker 0: now Let's say you share a computer with someone else.

521
00:39:37,178 --> 00:39:39,830
Speaker 0: this happens a lot at offices or in schools or whatever.

522
00:39:40,392 --> 00:39:42,961
Speaker 0: Now you've got another layer that you have to worry about.

523
00:39:43,021 --> 00:39:45,690
Speaker 0: not only do you have to protect the computer from access?

524
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:54,610
Speaker 0: Unauthorized from the outside, but you have to protect Individual users data from other users and you have to protect the system itself from all of the users.

525
00:39:54,610 --> 00:40:00,008
Speaker 1: Yeah How many people like have a family and they use Windows XP or whatever and they all log into the computer?

526
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,702
Speaker 1: Automatically logs in and no one writes a password in or they?

527
00:40:03,863 --> 00:40:05,670
Speaker 1: you know, they don't have separate user accounts.

528
00:40:05,730 --> 00:40:13,419
Speaker 1: You all just log in with the same user account and you don't have your own separate my documents folders and your separate bookmarks Or you know, everyone just uses the same one.

529
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:16,190
Speaker 1: It's bad news real bad news.

530
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:17,575
Speaker 0: Well, not necessarily.

531
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:29,330
Speaker 0: it's more that there are drawbacks to that but there are also benefits in terms of ease of use Yep, but - if you're looking at security one thing you have to worry about especially in a corporate setting is How do you protect a system from the users?

532
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:35,556
Speaker 0: It's not as though you're assuming that all your users are malicious and trying to destroy it though There are situations where you do assume that.

533
00:40:35,696 --> 00:40:37,643
Speaker 0: yeah, I have been told ex-employees.

534
00:40:38,084 --> 00:40:52,810
Speaker 0: Yep, or a kiosk for example I built machines to be used by basically factory workers know nothing about computers all over IBM and As a result, I locked them down assuming that the person using the computer was hostile toward my system.

535
00:40:53,192 --> 00:40:59,709
Speaker 0: I made the computer so that they could not no matter what they knew Damage the computer simply by using it.

536
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:05,450
Speaker 0: I had to protect the computer from its own users and that is a very critical part of security.

537
00:41:05,851 --> 00:41:09,041
Speaker 1: In fact, think about it most computers out there in the world.

538
00:41:09,483 --> 00:41:11,630
Speaker 1: They're getting used by the users every day.

539
00:41:12,033 --> 00:41:13,310
Speaker 1: They're getting hacked every day.

540
00:41:13,431 --> 00:41:22,510
Speaker 1: No, not likely I mean and not the kind of hacking attempt that you know You fantasize about in movies where some hacker tries to infiltrate like, you know and sneak in and steal the important data.

541
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:27,670
Speaker 1: But even in terms of spyware viruses and stuff is that coming in on a daily basis?

542
00:41:28,010 --> 00:41:29,729
Speaker 1: Well only if the user is a complete idiot.

543
00:41:30,211 --> 00:41:31,174
Speaker 1: So you're really.

544
00:41:31,576 --> 00:41:36,010
Speaker 1: the user is the most dangerous enemy to the security of the machine.

545
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:39,841
Speaker 0: Yep, the majority of data loss is not caused by hackers deleting it.

546
00:41:40,122 --> 00:41:45,223
Speaker 0: It's caused by users accidentally deleting their own data Yep, or corrupting their data or something.

547
00:41:45,846 --> 00:41:55,410
Speaker 1: another interesting fact I even have to protect the computer from myself sometimes so I don't accidentally do something, you know Like if I'm you know, try the ever typed are you're trying to delete a bunch of stuff?

548
00:41:55,490 --> 00:42:02,410
Speaker 0: You have like RM - our space star dot whatever but you accidentally put a space between the star and the dot whatever.

549
00:42:02,631 --> 00:42:05,747
Speaker 1: Yep, it's it's all over or you'll.

550
00:42:05,767 --> 00:42:12,070
Speaker 1: uh, you know I'll be backing up a database and I accidentally drop the tables instead of just dumping the tables and then oh shit.

551
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:13,816
Speaker 1: So I fucked up and it's bad news.

552
00:42:14,258 --> 00:42:17,690
Speaker 1: I get work if I ever do anything with any sort of important data.

553
00:42:18,192 --> 00:42:19,877
Speaker 1: I'm so ludicrously cautious.

554
00:42:20,218 --> 00:42:22,907
Speaker 1: Like I won't push the button unless I'm a hundred percent sure.

555
00:42:22,927 --> 00:42:27,519
Speaker 1: I won't push the button That's I'm 110 percent sure and I can't be 110 percent sure now.

556
00:42:27,560 --> 00:42:36,486
Speaker 0: computers particularly Unix and Linux based computers while operating systems I guess were built with that in mind while Windows wasn't until recently with NT in 2000 XP and all that.

557
00:42:37,572 --> 00:42:48,989
Speaker 0: Yeah so though these computers these operating systems have things built in that set it up so that you can partition off users from each other to where user Bob can't read user Joe's files.

558
00:42:49,009 --> 00:42:51,836
Speaker 0: and Even now I'm using my current computer.

559
00:42:52,318 --> 00:42:54,003
Speaker 0: I am NOT root on my computer.

560
00:42:54,304 --> 00:42:56,170
Speaker 0: I'm never logged in as administrator or root.

561
00:42:56,492 --> 00:42:59,290
Speaker 0: I'm logged in as rim and I have a separate root account.

562
00:42:59,752 --> 00:43:04,150
Speaker 0: So if I'm messing around with my computer and doing stuff and I accidentally delete a whole bunch of files.

563
00:43:04,612 --> 00:43:09,170
Speaker 0: At least I can't delete system files because by default I don't have permission to do so.

564
00:43:09,491 --> 00:43:17,190
Speaker 0: I have to go through an interlock or one extra step to prove that yes I wish to have these permissions and these powers before I continue.

565
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:17,491
Speaker 0: Yep,

566
00:43:17,932 --> 00:43:37,805
Speaker 1: and the reason that the systems are designed that way is because originally unlike Windows which was used Which is an operating system designed for one person sitting at one computer to use on their own originally Unix and Linux and all that stuff were mainframe type things where you'd have one giant Ludicrously expensive computer and then a bunch of terminals that were not computers.

567
00:43:37,825 --> 00:43:43,146
Speaker 1: They were just monitors keyboards No mouse is just monitors and keyboards that would hook up to this mainframe.

568
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:55,430
Speaker 1: We need to have 30 people simultaneously sharing the same CPU the same drives the same memory and You needed to find a way that those people could all share the machine and not fuck each other over at the same time.

569
00:43:55,510 --> 00:43:57,316
Speaker 0: Yep, and think about how many things that they could do.

570
00:43:57,357 --> 00:44:03,598
Speaker 0: what if one user executes a process that completely hoses the CPU It just uses the resources 100%.

571
00:44:03,598 --> 00:44:06,910
Speaker 0: someone else tries to fill up the entire hard disk system on the server.

572
00:44:07,432 --> 00:44:11,029
Speaker 0: Someone else tries to hack into a fourth person's account and read their files.

573
00:44:12,434 --> 00:44:16,550
Speaker 0: now also I Said IT security is basically data security.

574
00:44:16,952 --> 00:44:17,594
Speaker 0: Think about this.

575
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:23,176
Speaker 0: just here's an idea of all the possible factors you have to take into account And well, I guess you don't have to.

576
00:44:23,237 --> 00:44:26,650
Speaker 0: it's more a matter of how secure do you want to be and how much do you?

577
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,114
Speaker 0: Care and how important is the data?

578
00:44:28,455 --> 00:44:32,849
Speaker 0: say I've got a computer that has a database in it and it serves a web page out.

579
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:40,668
Speaker 0: so first I have to make sure that my web page and all that is secure and up-to-date so that someone can't Bust into the web server and take control of the computer.

580
00:44:41,118 --> 00:44:41,408
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

581
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:46,108
Speaker 0: I have to make sure that there aren't any other ports or ways that someone can break into the computer.

582
00:44:46,349 --> 00:44:49,025
Speaker 0: other Services that might be vulnerable like net bios.

583
00:44:49,066 --> 00:44:53,082
Speaker 0: Let's say I Have to make sure that the data on the computer.

584
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:56,850
Speaker 0: not only do I have to try to prevent people from Modifying it without my knowledge.

585
00:44:57,352 --> 00:45:03,170
Speaker 0: I want some sort of system to see if and when the data has been modified so that I know if anything is fishy.

586
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:04,411
Speaker 0: Alright.

587
00:45:04,852 --> 00:45:07,079
Speaker 0: now let's say I want to have backups of this database.

588
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:08,343
Speaker 0: So I make the backups.

589
00:45:08,945 --> 00:45:10,510
Speaker 0: Where are the backups stored?

590
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:11,833
Speaker 0: How are they secured?

591
00:45:12,234 --> 00:45:20,745
Speaker 0: all the security on a server in the world is useless if the backups are just shipped off to some Company that keeps them in a warehouse with a padlock on the door.

592
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:23,517
Speaker 0: Yeah That happens kind of often.

593
00:45:23,858 --> 00:45:26,750
Speaker 0: you'd be surprised how easy it is to get access to corporate backups.

594
00:45:27,233 --> 00:45:37,290
Speaker 1: Yep, you just walk right into some places you know like there are places that have a service that will store backups because the idea of backups is you don't want to Keep your backup in the same building as the server.

595
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:43,148
Speaker 1: Like let's say I have a server and I back up the hard drive to another hard drive and I just put that hard drive In a box on the floor.

596
00:45:43,692 --> 00:45:46,082
Speaker 1: Okay, sure if the hard drive in the server crashes I'm safe.

597
00:45:46,102 --> 00:45:48,653
Speaker 1: because I have a hard drive on the floor that's got the same Data, what if?

598
00:45:48,853 --> 00:45:50,158
Speaker 0: what if the office burns down?

599
00:45:50,198 --> 00:45:52,928
Speaker 1: What if the whole place is bombed or something crazy?

600
00:45:52,948 --> 00:45:53,570
Speaker 1: There's an earthquake.

601
00:45:54,493 --> 00:45:56,006
Speaker 1: I lost both of those drives shit.

602
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:56,410
Speaker 1: I'm done.

603
00:45:56,791 --> 00:46:05,230
Speaker 1: So if I have that other hard drive stored far away in another office That's quite a bit safer than just putting it in the same office.

604
00:46:05,451 --> 00:46:10,870
Speaker 0: It's safer from a data retention standpoint, but it's far more dangerous from a data protection standpoint.

605
00:46:11,030 --> 00:46:14,603
Speaker 1: Yep, because now there are two places and two ways people can get the data.

606
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:22,325
Speaker 1: if it's in one lockdown office You know, let's say Fort Knox then someone has to break into Fort Knox to get the data period.

607
00:46:22,706 --> 00:46:25,969
Speaker 1: let's say the data is in Fort Knox and it's also in Fort rim.

608
00:46:26,511 --> 00:46:37,190
Speaker 1: well now people have the option of breaking into either Fort rim or Fort Knox and if one of them is easier to Break into well, you know what they say the chain is as strong as the weakest link.

609
00:46:37,591 --> 00:46:49,890
Speaker 0: There's a possibly apocryphal tale about a financial company that was stationed in the World Trade Center and They had their data backups locally and they also had remote off-site backups that they contracted out to another company.

610
00:46:50,131 --> 00:46:51,053
Speaker 1: They weren't that dumb?

611
00:46:51,253 --> 00:46:57,590
Speaker 0: that other company supposedly was also in the World Trade Center like 25 floors down from them.

612
00:46:57,951 --> 00:47:03,770
Speaker 1: Well, I heard that actually what it was was that they is also agreeing that this is possibly a lie.

613
00:47:04,211 --> 00:47:15,290
Speaker 1: But supposedly a company outsourced their backups to be stored at some company far away and that company far away I re outsourced to another third company that was in the World Trade Center.

614
00:47:15,671 --> 00:47:26,116
Speaker 1: So the first company thought their backups were safe and far away and that first comfort the second company not realizing The first company was in the World Trade Center Outsourced the backups to the World Trade Center.

615
00:47:26,518 --> 00:47:29,706
Speaker 0: So you see there are a lot of factors involved and there's really.

616
00:47:29,726 --> 00:47:31,190
Speaker 0: there's no answer.

617
00:47:31,573 --> 00:47:32,077
Speaker 0: There's no.

618
00:47:32,258 --> 00:47:33,710
Speaker 0: this is how you secure something.

619
00:47:33,790 --> 00:47:34,713
Speaker 0: this is how you do it.

620
00:47:35,175 --> 00:47:51,770
Speaker 0: the industry practices and standards are pretty much just conveniences at best and true IT security basically requires someone like me or Scott or Some sort of IT professional to look at the exact situation the exact data how important the data is who needs to access it?

621
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:52,592
Speaker 1: Into what level?

622
00:47:52,813 --> 00:47:59,157
Speaker 0: Yep when they need to access it how much it needs to be backed up how how much trouble they're willing to Go through to access it.

623
00:47:59,198 --> 00:48:00,909
Speaker 1: How efficiently do they need to access it?

624
00:48:01,151 --> 00:48:03,303
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean we need to look at such things as.

625
00:48:03,605 --> 00:48:11,691
Speaker 0: here's a funny example There is one place at a place I worked at before Where we had a raised floor data center and the data center was locked 24/7.

626
00:48:11,691 --> 00:48:19,582
Speaker 0: you had to have a special code to get into the data center and there's a control room in the front and there's an Emergency door in the back that can't be opened from the outside without a code.

627
00:48:20,385 --> 00:48:21,530
Speaker 0: now the raised floor.

628
00:48:21,792 --> 00:48:23,930
Speaker 0: All right, the door is locked everything's secure.

629
00:48:24,010 --> 00:48:31,749
Speaker 0: But the raised floor went under the door and then outside of the back door There was like a landing where it was still raised floor and then stairs down.

630
00:48:32,353 --> 00:48:45,619
Speaker 0: So if theoretically if you wanted to get into this data center You could just pull up the floor tile on the outside crawl under the secure door and then pop up inside the data center through the floor Because no one thought about it now.

631
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:53,965
Speaker 0: Luckily this actual data center was not Critical in terms of the data being useful for people to steal.

632
00:48:53,985 --> 00:48:55,830
Speaker 0: It was a fairly small data center.

633
00:48:55,910 --> 00:48:59,830
Speaker 0: So when I pointed this out, it was basically said that yes, we're aware of it.

634
00:49:00,211 --> 00:49:08,040
Speaker 0: It is not worth going through the trouble to secure this particular data because this particular data is not terribly valuable And that's not necessarily a bad decision.

635
00:49:08,221 --> 00:49:10,470
Speaker 1: Yes, you have to make these sorts of things.

636
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:16,850
Speaker 1: I mean on the one hand if you wanted absolute security locked down impossible, you could run plan 9.

637
00:49:16,850 --> 00:49:18,738
Speaker 1: There's an operating system called plan 9.

638
00:49:18,738 --> 00:49:22,995
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's mostly a theoretical operating system But I'm pretty sure it does.

639
00:49:23,336 --> 00:49:38,843
Speaker 1: you can actually run it and it's pretty much designed with nothing but security and perfection in mind and If you actually run it and try to do anything with it other than very few applications in the world It'll basically be a nightmare for users and it'll suck.

640
00:49:39,144 --> 00:49:40,610
Speaker 1: It'll suck really big.

641
00:49:40,992 --> 00:49:42,901
Speaker 0: I mean think in terms of the equivalent.

642
00:49:43,243 --> 00:49:44,590
Speaker 0: you all saw a mission impossible.

643
00:49:45,314 --> 00:49:48,110
Speaker 0: You know the computer room they had and how he broke in and got all the data.

644
00:49:48,690 --> 00:49:53,790
Speaker 0: That's the kind of security that makes a computer perfectly secure and it makes the computer almost unusable.

645
00:49:54,011 --> 00:49:55,237
Speaker 0: I mean think about that computer.

646
00:49:55,258 --> 00:49:57,570
Speaker 0: how the hell did people use that computer?

647
00:49:58,710 --> 00:49:59,474
Speaker 1: They didn't it?

648
00:49:59,514 --> 00:50:01,202
Speaker 1: just that it was stupid.

649
00:50:01,383 --> 00:50:02,288
Speaker 1: It was stupid.

650
00:50:02,649 --> 00:50:06,064
Speaker 0: now We're going to break this up into a whole bunch of individual shows.

651
00:50:06,385 --> 00:50:10,530
Speaker 0: if you care about the order We do these security topics in let us know in the forums.

652
00:50:10,992 --> 00:50:16,172
Speaker 0: We're really not in any particular hurry to get into specific ones since we can talk about all of them about equally Yep.

653
00:50:16,574 --> 00:50:20,090
Speaker 1: Now the only other thing I want to add is that we are not experts in security.

654
00:50:20,211 --> 00:50:22,328
Speaker 1: Sure, we took some security classes in college.

655
00:50:22,408 --> 00:50:26,650
Speaker 1: Sure We're generally smart about this sort of thing, but we are not the geniuses of security.

656
00:50:26,770 --> 00:50:29,702
Speaker 0: No, in fact, I'm basically an IT guy.

657
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:35,508
Speaker 0: I can manage IT security fairly Well, I don't know a lot about application security at all.

658
00:50:35,689 --> 00:50:51,346
Speaker 1: Yeah well If you want to hear from someone who is pretty much in my opinion and the opinion of many others the world Genius perfect expert of security you want to look up a man named Bruce Schneier S-c-h-n-e-i-e-r not Gibson.

659
00:50:51,587 --> 00:50:54,589
Speaker 1: No Steve Gibson and he's a little crazy.

660
00:50:55,192 --> 00:51:02,441
Speaker 1: Bruce Schneier is like if you go look for the IT conversations network, you can find There's a few podcasts with him talking in it.

661
00:51:02,762 --> 00:51:21,090
Speaker 1: He's not only a genius of IT security He's a genius of all security in general and he has written at least one or two books and you can hear him talking All over the internet and read things he's written everywhere and as far as I'm concerned There is no person on earth who can better secure things and better know about security than this man.

662
00:51:21,491 --> 00:51:24,702
Speaker 1: And if you really want to know stuff, he is your go-to guy.

663
00:51:24,943 --> 00:51:27,070
Speaker 0: Yep, particularly low-level stuff.

664
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:34,735
Speaker 0: I mean we can talk a lot about the high level or the ideas but in terms of actual direct practice of especially the more Esoteric security options.

665
00:51:35,378 --> 00:51:42,930
Speaker 0: I've never actually had call to use a lot of them and most of the companies I've worked for Actually care a lot less about security than I personally do on my own computer.

666
00:51:43,265 --> 00:52:00,450
Speaker 1: Yeah But also do not fear like if you don't if you think you don't understand computers super well Don't be afraid to go listen to this guy anyway because like the most interesting thing he talked about once is he was talking about airport security and He didn't talk about like oh, this is how the you know, the metal detector works and how you can sneak through.

667
00:52:00,550 --> 00:52:08,382
Speaker 1: He was like, oh this and the psychology of the people there and you know This is how you this actually gets you security and that doesn't etc.

668
00:52:08,402 --> 00:52:08,783
Speaker 1: etc.

669
00:52:08,823 --> 00:52:10,750
Speaker 1: and it was really goddamn interesting.

670
00:52:11,432 --> 00:52:16,810
Speaker 1: And if I was in some position of power, I would assign him to secure the airports and not whoever's doing it.

671
00:52:16,850 --> 00:52:17,151
Speaker 1: Yeah,

672
00:52:17,573 --> 00:52:35,245
Speaker 0: so basically what we're trying to say here is that we will go up to the level We are comfortable speaking as experts we got in regards to computer security and we will not authoritatively say anything beyond that level because While we can make educated guesses and we can definitely put forth how we would do it.

673
00:52:35,606 --> 00:52:40,908
Speaker 0: We are definitely not Experts in computer security like this person or some other people out there.

674
00:52:41,069 --> 00:52:48,284
Speaker 1: Yes Also, I think our next episode should probably be like hey If you have a personal computer with Windows is what you do to not be a fool.

675
00:52:48,464 --> 00:52:52,477
Speaker 0: Yep, or possibly just Security in terms of individual PCs.

676
00:52:52,758 --> 00:52:52,959
Speaker 1: Yep.

677
00:52:53,279 --> 00:52:53,460
Speaker 1: Yep.

678
00:52:53,861 --> 00:52:54,362
Speaker 1: That's a good one.

679
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:56,990
Speaker 1: That's actually useful to the most people in the most ways.

680
00:52:57,291 --> 00:53:12,010
Speaker 0: Yes, luckily, it's actually pretty simple to secure a single standalone PC that you're not backing up Especially if it's your personal PC because the crack hackers of the world are not trying to get into Joey Jojo shabbat whose PC to look at his Pokemon poll.

681
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:13,730
Speaker 1: They're not actively trying to get into it.

682
00:53:13,770 --> 00:53:18,180
Speaker 1: If you went to say if you brought it to Def Con then yes They would be actively trying to get into sure.

683
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:25,190
Speaker 1: if you're just sitting there on your cable modem There isn't a hacker out there sitting, you know manually trying to break into your computer.

684
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:39,190
Speaker 1: However, there are many automatic computers out there zombies if you will roaming around just attempting to get you In a very stupid and predictable manner, but if you are equally stupid You will get bit and turn into a zombie yourself.

685
00:53:39,591 --> 00:54:04,564
Speaker 0: See my point there is simply that if you do your due diligence and luckily the due diligence for a standalone PC is very Very very simple and easy to do you're immune to the probably 99% of any attack that will ever hit your PC because the only attacks that will get past basic due diligence are direct Concentrated efforts by people who know what they're doing against you and those

686
00:54:04,945 --> 00:54:06,550
Speaker 1: are rare or you being an idiot

687
00:54:07,092 --> 00:54:13,490
Speaker 0: In which case you have not undergone due diligence and then the fault is at least as far as I'm concerned entirely yours.

688
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:19,189
Speaker 1: Yes, if you go to some where's site download an exe and run it you get what you put your page.

689
00:54:19,973 --> 00:54:28,229
Speaker 0: if you read a website that tells you how to access something and Part of their instructions are turn off your firewall and then open up all the ports on your router and you do it.

690
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:29,936
Speaker 1: Yeah, good job.

691
00:54:30,761 --> 00:54:38,290
