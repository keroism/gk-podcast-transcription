10
00:00:36,241 --> 00:00:38,368
Speaker 0: You think so like a 50 year old man.

11
00:00:38,408 --> 00:00:40,053
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way if you die.

12
00:00:40,073 --> 00:00:41,718
Speaker 1: I'll keep doing the show.

Speaker 1: great Thanks, but if I die will you keep doing the show?

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,589
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe eventually it will return.

15
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:51,596
Speaker 1: you might have to learn some audio editing.

16
00:00:52,038 --> 00:00:56,386
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah We'll see all right, but we're back.

17
00:00:56,466 --> 00:01:01,640
Speaker 1: geek nights is back on its regular semi-permanent schedule until other conventions get in the way.

18
00:01:01,941 --> 00:01:03,206
Speaker 0: Thanks, East's back.

19
00:01:03,226 --> 00:01:06,480
Speaker 1: Cease is coming and speaking of which backs East is sold out.

20
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,091
Speaker 1: So if you didn't do what we said why don't you know?

21
00:01:09,131 --> 00:01:11,120
Speaker 0: he said we always steer you right?

22
00:01:11,180 --> 00:01:12,427
Speaker 0: When have we steered you wrong?

23
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:15,100
Speaker 1: the fucking day that packs these badges went on sale?

24
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:15,923
Speaker 1: You should have bought them.

25
00:01:16,545 --> 00:01:18,051
Speaker 1: It's been many days since then.

26
00:01:18,071 --> 00:01:18,895
Speaker 1: you have no excuse.

27
00:01:19,116 --> 00:01:19,658
Speaker 1: No badges.

28
00:01:19,718 --> 00:01:21,405
Speaker 0: at this point It's not even gonna be like.

29
00:01:21,466 --> 00:01:23,254
Speaker 0: I'm trying to teach you a lesson anymore now.

30
00:01:23,415 --> 00:01:24,540
Speaker 0: I'm just going to admonish you.

31
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,506
Speaker 0: It's like well you deserve it you dumbass.

32
00:01:26,566 --> 00:01:37,603
Speaker 1: however if you did not get a badge and you need a badge One way to do this is to submit a panel or lecture and get it accepted or below or sir Low of that.

33
00:01:37,964 --> 00:01:40,553
Speaker 1: another way is to buy an exhibitor table.

34
00:01:40,593 --> 00:01:41,957
Speaker 1: that gives you a bunch of badges.

35
00:01:41,977 --> 00:01:43,984
Speaker 1: that also cost Thousands of dollars.

36
00:01:44,004 --> 00:01:45,810
Speaker 0: depends on the size of the table depends.

37
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:52,350
Speaker 0: if you got any video game to pimp it could be prices significantly lower But bigger table you get the more badges it comes with.

38
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:53,293
Speaker 0: that is also true.

39
00:01:53,554 --> 00:01:53,915
Speaker 1: Actually.

40
00:01:53,935 --> 00:01:55,360
Speaker 1: I don't have the price sheet for this year.

41
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,104
Speaker 1: I should get that.

42
00:01:56,165 --> 00:01:59,528
Speaker 0: it also gets you in the exhibitor room slightly early Cuz I.

43
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:06,540
Speaker 1: while you're setting up your shit You can look at everyone else's shit or as Scott was alluding to you can sign up to be an enforcer.

44
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:07,903
Speaker 0: That's a good move.

45
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:27,812
Speaker 1: They need enforcers for PAX East and let me tell you I've been staff for anime cons video game cons gaming cons generic cons that aren't generic on and PAX pretty much has the best deal for staff in terms of responsibility versus fun versus respect versus reward.

46
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:38,337
Speaker 1: and Well now see the thing is before The reward ratio was kind of skewed because you could spend some dollars to get a PAX badge Or you could enforce and get in for free, but have to work a whole bunch.

47
00:02:38,659 --> 00:02:42,620
Speaker 1: now It's either in force or don't fucking go to packs.

48
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:52,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if you're gonna enforce though and try to you know get in that way only do it if you're actually gonna be Serious and do a good job with the enforcing.

49
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:56,034
Speaker 0: don't try to enforce Just to get a badge and then do a shit ass.

50
00:02:56,095 --> 00:02:56,678
Speaker 0: enforce cuz.

51
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:59,289
Speaker 0: yeah Robert who will come and kick you in the day?

52
00:02:59,329 --> 00:03:01,478
Speaker 1: think you can pull off what most anime cons pull off.

53
00:03:01,538 --> 00:03:04,610
Speaker 1: you get to be Quote-unquote gopher and do some grunt work, and then you're in now.

54
00:03:05,112 --> 00:03:07,260
Speaker 1: You've pretty much got to be a badass to be an enforcer.

55
00:03:07,422 --> 00:03:08,535
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can go watch this PA.

56
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:12,170
Speaker 0: There's a recent penny arcade television episode about enforcers.

57
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:15,020
Speaker 0: go watch that shit and then decide if that's for you.

58
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:21,140
Speaker 1: Yes If Aaron see looks like a man that you can respect and take orders from then I think he's identified in the video as airwolf.

59
00:03:21,802 --> 00:03:29,009
Speaker 1: Ah, the thing is you know what he's identified as the man who looks smashing in a real kill not a you till a kill I killed.

60
00:03:29,231 --> 00:03:30,945
Speaker 0: that's right Mm-hmm.

61
00:03:32,103 --> 00:03:33,932
Speaker 1: Anyway, but yeah PAX East it's coming.

62
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:34,495
Speaker 1: It's coming.

63
00:03:34,676 --> 00:03:35,500
Speaker 1: We'll be there doing stuff.

64
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,932
Speaker 0: Are you gonna met a moment in opening bit because it's sold out?

65
00:03:39,113 --> 00:03:40,418
Speaker 1: sure as was expected.

66
00:03:40,438 --> 00:03:42,056
Speaker 1: There's one other bit I don't want to talk about though.

67
00:03:42,846 --> 00:03:43,838
Speaker 1: PAX East is sold out.

68
00:03:44,521 --> 00:03:48,872
Speaker 1: You're gonna see a lot of people at the con and on Craigslist selling packs badges.

69
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:49,814
Speaker 0: do not buy.

70
00:03:49,834 --> 00:03:54,247
Speaker 1: the odds are I'm gonna say Pretty much like 70%.

71
00:03:54,247 --> 00:03:55,029
Speaker 1: there's.

72
00:03:55,089 --> 00:04:02,635
Speaker 0: someone tries to sell you a badge and they aren't someone you know And they're not selling it through an official channel or they're not being cool.

73
00:04:02,656 --> 00:04:03,659
Speaker 1: They won't show you ID.

74
00:04:04,062 --> 00:04:05,438
Speaker 0: They're not in the penny arcade forum.

75
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:09,452
Speaker 1: Like you don't have evidence that they're a gamer who legitimately like had a reason.

76
00:04:09,492 --> 00:04:10,175
Speaker 1: now he can't go.

77
00:04:10,696 --> 00:04:11,860
Speaker 1: It's probably counterfeit.

78
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,267
Speaker 1: We're gonna make a video later because I've got in fact in front of me a small pile of Counterfeit badges from the last time.

79
00:04:18,288 --> 00:04:20,600
Speaker 0: they're not gonna let you the fuck in and you know what?

80
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:27,913
Speaker 0: So you're gonna buy a hotel room in Boston travel there try to go in and they're gonna say fuck Get the hell out of here, and I'll tell you what.

81
00:04:27,973 --> 00:04:31,532
Speaker 1: if I see a counterfeit badge I'm just gonna tear it in half and keep walking because you know what.

82
00:04:31,853 --> 00:04:33,240
Speaker 1: here's how to tell a counterfeit badge.

83
00:04:33,662 --> 00:04:34,788
Speaker 1: You can tear them in half.

84
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:47,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you can't tear it in half It's probably but I heard but accordingly that you know I have received information that this year They are still mailing badges, which will give counterfeiters time to copy them, but they have taken measures.

85
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:49,868
Speaker 0: They said this they're taking some measures.

86
00:04:49,948 --> 00:04:50,831
Speaker 0: We do not know what measures.

87
00:04:50,872 --> 00:04:53,360
Speaker 0: They are to make it harder to counterfeit.

88
00:04:53,521 --> 00:04:56,049
Speaker 0: Imagine the badge is going to be harder to copy.

89
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:00,646
Speaker 1: the thing is once we knew there were counterfeit badges like once we knew that Was the thing and someone showed us one.

90
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:03,117
Speaker 1: you could pretty much spot him a mile away.

91
00:05:03,158 --> 00:05:04,182
Speaker 1: like there's one There's one.

92
00:05:04,222 --> 00:05:04,765
Speaker 1: There's one.

93
00:05:04,785 --> 00:05:08,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I have it on good authority, but this is no way official.

94
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:18,600
Speaker 1: This is just me here saying from other people who may or may not know things That there will be no secure for people who have a counterfeit badge.

95
00:05:19,124 --> 00:05:21,060
Speaker 1: You will not be let in if you were caught with it.

96
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,520
Speaker 1: They're probably just gonna take the badge away, and you're fucked anyway.

97
00:05:25,601 --> 00:05:26,544
Speaker 0: So now who's?

98
00:05:26,584 --> 00:05:28,209
Speaker 0: that's not metamoment nice.

99
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:28,530
Speaker 1: Yes.

100
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:30,577
Speaker 0: We're not talking about any packs in the meta moment now.

101
00:05:30,838 --> 00:05:39,799
Speaker 0: Okay, so If you do not know right Kotaku, which is a blog that is much maligned because it is on the gawker network But at the same time it's pretty good.

102
00:05:39,860 --> 00:05:40,101
Speaker 1: Well,

103
00:05:40,261 --> 00:06:12,220
Speaker 0: I read it only because it's one of the only gaming blogs that has actual people mainly one person bright In Japan and they post a lot of posts that aren't even about games and stuff a lot of times But are about Japanese things that aren't really posted on other English language gaming blogs such as they'll have like cosplay photos from comic cat or they'll have something about like you know some idol who's playing some video games or This crazy game is coming out in the arcades in Japan like Gundam pods.

104
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:16,572
Speaker 0: You won't see that shit on joystick or IGN or pretty much anywhere, right?

105
00:06:16,592 --> 00:06:24,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's why I still reads the Kotaku, but The guy the number one guy at least at Kotaku is Brian crescent e and he was pretty.

106
00:06:24,537 --> 00:06:31,220
Speaker 0: he was a pretty good guy Pretty good guy, but he left and he didn't say where he was going, but the next day the news came out.

107
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:33,849
Speaker 0: Apparently there's some company called Vox.

108
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:41,300
Speaker 0: I don't know much about them, but what they did is They have pulled the ultimate coup in the world of games journalism.

109
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:43,772
Speaker 0: They went and they got Chris Grant.

110
00:06:43,913 --> 00:06:50,580
Speaker 0: Chris Grant was Like the number one guy at the joystick from what I heard, right?

111
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:59,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, then they went out and they got Justin McElroy also A guy who is from game pro PC gamer.

112
00:06:59,058 --> 00:07:03,012
Speaker 1: Wow Two really good legendary guys is pretty good, isn't it?

113
00:07:03,032 --> 00:07:05,200
Speaker 0: Then they got Brian crescent e from from Kotaku.

114
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,012
Speaker 0: Then they got Russ Pitts who was from gamers at jobs.

115
00:07:08,032 --> 00:07:16,328
Speaker 0: I used to listen to his podcast the gamers jobs radio And He is used to be the editor-in-chief of the escapist So he's one of the awesomest.

116
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:18,299
Speaker 0: Russ Pitts is like probably the awesomest on the list.

117
00:07:19,103 --> 00:07:22,417
Speaker 0: Then they got Chris planty who is a guy who did a bunch of stuff.

118
00:07:22,537 --> 00:07:23,200
Speaker 0: escape his joy.

119
00:07:24,022 --> 00:07:26,479
Speaker 0: It was this games editor at ugo.com.

120
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:31,617
Speaker 0: They got rush Rush dick from MTV News and a whole bunch of other things.

121
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:41,971
Speaker 0: six They got Arthur geez the previews editor joysticks And Griffin McElroy who has been writing about games for seven years.

122
00:07:41,991 --> 00:07:45,284
Speaker 0: He was a contributing editor at Joystick and Eight people.

123
00:07:47,561 --> 00:07:49,787
Speaker 0: God, yeah, they got all.

124
00:07:50,008 --> 00:07:54,020
Speaker 0: they pretty much went out and they stole the a-list guys from every team.

125
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:57,380
Speaker 0: This is a Yankees situation all the free agents.

126
00:07:57,460 --> 00:08:00,960
Speaker 0: Just get the best guy in every team and put them all in one gaming blog.

127
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:05,820
Speaker 0: The blog doesn't exist yet, but when it does it's gonna be the gaming blog.

128
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:08,377
Speaker 0: You can just delete joystick from your RSS reader.

129
00:08:08,397 --> 00:08:10,569
Speaker 0: now This you can filter Kotaku's.

130
00:08:10,609 --> 00:08:12,660
Speaker 0: the only see the post by Brian Griscenti.

131
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:23,218
Speaker 1: I mean that right Ashcraft because this tells us something very interesting though I mean we make fun of video game journalism a lot because it's kind of crappy by and large.

132
00:08:23,238 --> 00:08:35,520
Speaker 0: the main problem I have with gert-game journalism is that there are plenty of good game journalists and a lot of these people have excellent Journalism skills and they have plenty of plenty good web journalism skills and a lot of them have a lot of knowledge of recent games.

133
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:36,950
Speaker 0: Which are the ones they talk about the most?

134
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they do a good job.

135
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:44,923
Speaker 0: The problem is very few of these people, you know actually have a deep knowledge of games Period.

136
00:08:45,365 --> 00:08:48,437
Speaker 0: so their perspective is just like hey a new game came out.

137
00:08:48,498 --> 00:08:49,040
Speaker 0: Is it fun?

138
00:08:49,342 --> 00:08:52,079
Speaker 0: and it's like a lot of people that's what they want, but it's so shallow.

139
00:08:52,099 --> 00:09:00,320
Speaker 0: and You know the real meat is someone who actually you know I mean Totillo who just took over for Kotaku because Griscenti left, right?

140
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,192
Speaker 0: He's also he's the perfect example excellent journalism skills.

141
00:09:04,413 --> 00:09:04,995
Speaker 0: I've met him.

142
00:09:05,236 --> 00:09:06,080
Speaker 0: He's a nice guy.

143
00:09:06,381 --> 00:09:09,852
Speaker 0: He's well-meaning, but he just doesn't have game knowledge.

144
00:09:10,073 --> 00:09:12,140
Speaker 0: I know ten times more about games.

145
00:09:12,342 --> 00:09:14,520
Speaker 1: So why aren't we doing game journalism?

146
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:19,839
Speaker 0: I don't have journalism shittily don't have journalism skills But this tells us a couple of things.

147
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:24,640
Speaker 1: The most interesting thing to come out of this is that you know, we make so much fun of video game journalism.

148
00:09:25,483 --> 00:09:44,404
Speaker 1: The fact that this coup was possible means that there either aren't Non-competes in that industry clearly or that people are betting that nobody has the wherewithal to follow through on them and That is a sign of a very immature industry Which means that we're kind of.

149
00:09:44,424 --> 00:09:55,540
Speaker 1: this is a major turning point because now in the future in this industry There's gonna be a whole bunch of non-compete BS Which will actually make it more difficult for anyone to compete with this new offering.

150
00:09:55,741 --> 00:10:01,099
Speaker 0: Well, I think what it's shown more than anything right is something that I knew but I didn't realize.

151
00:10:01,159 --> 00:10:04,460
Speaker 0: it's like oh I knew that but you didn't think this is the opposite of the Peter principle.

152
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:05,886
Speaker 0: No, which is that in the?

153
00:10:05,987 --> 00:10:08,940
Speaker 0: you know, if you look at for example the newspaper world, right?

154
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,994
Speaker 0: Very few people pay attention to who the writer is on newspaper articles, right?

155
00:10:13,054 --> 00:10:14,680
Speaker 0: It's about the name of the newspaper.

156
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:19,300
Speaker 0: It's like oh it's an article in the New York Times about the blah blah blah right in game journalism.

157
00:10:19,701 --> 00:10:26,660
Speaker 0: It's all about the person who is doing the reviewing because the you know, the it's it's not about where they are.

158
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:27,824
Speaker 1: Here's something interesting.

159
00:10:27,884 --> 00:10:29,129
Speaker 1: It's not just game journalism.

160
00:10:29,309 --> 00:10:30,775
Speaker 1: anime journalism is the same way and

161
00:10:31,156 --> 00:10:31,357
Speaker 0: actually

162
00:10:31,377 --> 00:10:45,126
Speaker 1: anecdotally Connecticut right, you know, we run the panels Department of Connecticut all the panels and workshops and The biggest question we got last year was people who didn't know the schedule was out all the titles everything was there But they wanted to know.

163
00:10:45,146 --> 00:10:47,835
Speaker 1: I want to see the panel by Joey Jojo.

164
00:10:48,377 --> 00:10:51,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't care what it's on I want to see panels by this guy.

165
00:10:51,046 --> 00:10:58,654
Speaker 0: this is because the internet a lot, you know in the in the social media Especially, you know, you're not connecting with the brand.

166
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:12,080
Speaker 0: right you're connecting with this, you know Cuz when brands advertise themselves and market themselves these days a lot of them are just so corporate and have corporate Speak and you're not actually connecting with them, you know, for example Hasbro, right?

167
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,791
Speaker 0: It's like we are announcing the blah blah blah.

168
00:11:14,892 --> 00:11:15,434
Speaker 0: It's like great.

169
00:11:15,474 --> 00:11:31,102
Speaker 0: Thanks guys, but the Individuals when they're allowed to have the Twitter account that's associated with there Whatever you connect directly with the people doing the thing and especially in journalism We're pretty much they're tweeting and Facebook and like crazy more than any other industry Right.

170
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:37,140
Speaker 0: the consumers of the media are connecting with directly the producers and authors of the media.

171
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,960
Speaker 1: So this allows another principle to take fold to a degree that you can't see in technology.

172
00:11:41,462 --> 00:11:42,244
Speaker 1: We always talk about how.

173
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:52,660
Speaker 1: in technology firms if there's a critical mass of smart people then Dumb people will be weeded out and that company will attract more smart people because smart people like to work as smart people.

174
00:11:52,681 --> 00:11:53,260
Speaker 1: They don't like to deal.

175
00:11:53,361 --> 00:12:01,140
Speaker 0: I think the only reason that any of these journalists need to team up at all Right because they could all just start their own blogs and forget working but with their power combined.

176
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,469
Speaker 0: But by combining they can sell.

177
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:13,687
Speaker 0: they can get more hits on the same page on the web Internet's to get and they can sell that one ad for more dollars than they could if they sold five ads that had 1/5 as many hits.

178
00:12:13,968 --> 00:12:15,536
Speaker 1: but in technology, you know the other.

179
00:12:15,597 --> 00:12:16,240
Speaker 1: the opposite is true.

180
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,031
Speaker 0: And also, you know the rate of content production.

181
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:25,919
Speaker 0: if you have one blog by yourself you get an article today But if you get a blog with eight people Get a whole bunch of articles per day.

182
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:26,682
Speaker 1: But back to my point.

183
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:31,980
Speaker 1: the opposite is true a place that has a critical mass of bad people will drive smart people away.

184
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:36,540
Speaker 1: But it's a slow process because it's hard to change jobs in a lot of industries.

185
00:12:37,043 --> 00:12:42,560
Speaker 1: It so happens that this relatively immature industry Especially with the fact that you don't need an office to a degree

186
00:12:43,082 --> 00:12:46,534
Speaker 0: Work from home people who send articles in and someone puts them in a blog some the

187
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:53,640
Speaker 1: cost of distribution and collaboration Everything is so low that the barrier to switching jobs is almost zero.

188
00:12:54,662 --> 00:12:57,774
Speaker 1: So as a result all these factors combined and I'm actually excited about this.

189
00:12:57,794 --> 00:13:04,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm looking forward to finally Of course, it might be that could potentially be better than all of the game might be bitter disappointment.

190
00:13:04,981 --> 00:13:06,707
Speaker 1: You got to have guarded optimism.

191
00:13:07,349 --> 00:13:08,773
Speaker 0: I think it'll be probably the best.

192
00:13:08,974 --> 00:13:10,820
Speaker 0: it looks like it's gonna be the best gaming blog.

193
00:13:12,001 --> 00:13:14,131
Speaker 1: That's not saying a lot but that's a high compliment.

194
00:13:14,332 --> 00:13:17,880
Speaker 0: well, you know, we need one because you look around It's like which one really stands out as great.

195
00:13:17,921 --> 00:13:27,872
Speaker 0: I mean, there's some that are good but they're only good in particular areas like you can get a rock-paper-shotgun and they'll do a really good job on like indie PC games and Not much else, but they do a really good job on that.

196
00:13:27,892 --> 00:13:32,657
Speaker 0: or you go to like Gama Sutra And they'll do a really good job on some like, you know in-depth stuff.

197
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:35,388
Speaker 1: Well, like right now How did I learn about the next news we're talking about?

198
00:13:35,769 --> 00:13:38,440
Speaker 1: I saw it on slash jot as an afterthought, right?

199
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:41,570
Speaker 0: But they won't really, you know be whatever.

200
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:48,030
Speaker 1: so speaking of the news I just saw on slash dot There's a Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition coming.

201
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:52,205
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw like an inkling like maybe one sentence Nowhere.

202
00:13:52,245 --> 00:13:56,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is maybe on a Twitter I saw a sentence or maybe on a blog a comment or something.

203
00:13:56,676 --> 00:14:00,678
Speaker 0: That was like announcement something something big and I was like whatever.

204
00:14:00,738 --> 00:14:07,700
Speaker 0: and then Suddenly I see like today or yesterday like 5th edition and I'm like, what the fuck?

205
00:14:07,982 --> 00:14:09,416
Speaker 1: So two interesting things.

206
00:14:09,699 --> 00:14:13,699
Speaker 1: one Nobody in my circles was really talking about this.

207
00:14:14,704 --> 00:14:21,230
Speaker 1: Nope, despite the fact that we're pretty deep in the role-playing community Like no one seemed to really notice.

208
00:14:21,912 --> 00:14:24,440
Speaker 1: and to uh, I want to point something out.

209
00:14:24,821 --> 00:14:28,980
Speaker 1: I'm stealing from Nighthawk 214 who put this little list together.

210
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:32,678
Speaker 1: 1974 first edition, that's right.

211
00:14:32,678 --> 00:14:34,928
Speaker 1: 1989 so that is 15 years second ed.

212
00:14:34,948 --> 00:14:38,746
Speaker 1: Okay 2000 third ed.

213
00:14:38,746 --> 00:14:41,989
Speaker 0: 11 years.

214
00:14:42,069 --> 00:14:50,242
Speaker 1: so it keeps getting shorter less time between editions 15 and 11 a third and a half edition sometime in between their fourth edition 2008 so eight years.

215
00:14:50,423 --> 00:14:51,165
Speaker 0: so 15 11 8. what year is it?

216
00:14:51,165 --> 00:14:58,978
Speaker 1: 2012 so by this rate has been four years in 40 years.

217
00:15:00,381 --> 00:15:05,600
Speaker 0: Edition of Dungeons & Dragons every 16 seconds, but is the fifth edition coming out this year or next year?

218
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,784
Speaker 0: I mean, this is just an announcement.

219
00:15:06,845 --> 00:15:07,106
Speaker 0: It does.

220
00:15:07,126 --> 00:15:11,927
Speaker 0: I didn't get the feeling it's going to play testing now, really I was getting the feeling like that.

221
00:15:11,947 --> 00:15:16,930
Speaker 0: They didn't even start it yet that they were just like the announcement was like We're gonna make it we're starting work now.

222
00:15:17,513 --> 00:15:19,321
Speaker 0: No that it's play testing now They're.

223
00:15:19,422 --> 00:15:22,593
Speaker 1: they're taking submissions to do play testing and stuff with them.

224
00:15:22,734 --> 00:15:25,083
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought the submissions were really good for All.

225
00:15:25,123 --> 00:15:26,387
Speaker 0: right now do I?

226
00:15:27,311 --> 00:15:28,796
Speaker 1: I'm not one to be super like.

227
00:15:28,836 --> 00:15:38,560
Speaker 1: when fourth edition came out I I was very I didn't like it But at the same time I didn't shit all over it because I thought my complaints were justified.

228
00:15:38,620 --> 00:15:40,609
Speaker 0: Well, it sort of made sense for the times right?

229
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:45,669
Speaker 0: It's like hey, they're making Wow the tabletop RPG You know, no one feels useless.

230
00:15:45,709 --> 00:15:47,776
Speaker 0: the game right was the third edition, you know, you did.

231
00:15:47,796 --> 00:15:48,840
Speaker 0: you felt useless game.

232
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:53,880
Speaker 1: Where I look at and say here are problems, but those are only problems for XY and Z kind of gamers.

233
00:15:53,981 --> 00:16:08,970
Speaker 1: They're not problems for our kind of gamer the letter R. so if our gamers want to play D&D fourth edition is exactly what they want, but fifth edition reeks of Being the last edition.

234
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:12,728
Speaker 1: it reeks of failure Right off the bat.

235
00:16:12,768 --> 00:16:15,200
Speaker 1: and I'm really because one here's something really interesting.

236
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:17,428
Speaker 1: I'm looking at the slash shot comments.

237
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:20,759
Speaker 1: right you think slash shots a pretty big haven of like old-school D&D players.

238
00:16:20,779 --> 00:16:26,136
Speaker 1: a Lot of the comments here aren't even about the fifth edition announced they're about Pathfinder.

239
00:16:26,337 --> 00:16:26,638
Speaker 0: No.

240
00:16:26,698 --> 00:16:30,100
Speaker 1: No There's one guy who's like, yeah Pathfinder.

241
00:16:31,382 --> 00:16:39,360
Speaker 1: Most of the comments and the follow-up discussion in other places is people saying man I always want to play D&D, but I can't find anyone to play with.

242
00:16:40,381 --> 00:16:47,700
Speaker 1: Yeah that in that today that is still the primary complaint of RPG people that they can't find someone to play with.

243
00:16:48,422 --> 00:16:54,909
Speaker 0: It's because the people who most want to play RPGs are the people who just don't talk to people there is someone to play with In your town, even in the sticks,

244
00:16:54,969 --> 00:16:55,914
Speaker 1: uh, not always

245
00:16:56,216 --> 00:16:56,517
Speaker 0: almost

246
00:16:56,618 --> 00:17:02,918
Speaker 1: always I think it's more that we're sheltered from that because if you live in a population center It's absolutely guaranteed that there are gigantic groups of people.

247
00:17:03,662 --> 00:17:13,978
Speaker 1: But at the same time even at pretty hardcore events in New York City that we go to Most of the people there show up live in the city and say things like yeah I almost never get to play a role-playing game.

248
00:17:14,621 --> 00:17:16,627
Speaker 0: You gotta set time aside for that shit.

249
00:17:16,707 --> 00:17:17,549
Speaker 0: be consistent.

250
00:17:17,628 --> 00:17:21,480
Speaker 0: actually fucking show up and talk to people human beings.

251
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:27,220
Speaker 0: But I heard a recess this week and they're actually gonna have a thing like get together and you know start games with people.

252
00:17:27,481 --> 00:17:28,708
Speaker 1: Yep, they're gonna have open tables.

253
00:17:28,748 --> 00:17:29,512
Speaker 1: They're gonna set that up.

254
00:17:29,553 --> 00:17:30,096
Speaker 1: No, they're gonna.

255
00:17:30,176 --> 00:17:35,900
Speaker 0: they're gonna have a thing That's like hey all you people get together and form gaming groups that will meet regularly on your own.

256
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:38,059
Speaker 0: So like gamer dating but not dating to go.

257
00:17:38,502 --> 00:17:40,775
Speaker 1: We should do a show about this because they're gonna run into the problem.

258
00:17:40,815 --> 00:17:41,560
Speaker 1: They always run into.

259
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:49,920
Speaker 1: The majority of players want something very different from the majority of game masters and there's already a shortage of game masters.

260
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:50,482
Speaker 0: Players.

261
00:17:50,542 --> 00:17:56,519
Speaker 1: just fucking GM Jesus Christ or you're gonna have to play the weird indie games that the GM's all want to do.

262
00:17:57,142 --> 00:17:57,684
Speaker 1: You can't get.

263
00:17:57,724 --> 00:17:59,290
Speaker 1: no one wants to run D&D for you.

264
00:18:00,013 --> 00:18:01,259
Speaker 0: You don't need someone to run D&D.

265
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,300
Speaker 0: Just take some fucking monsters and you're the player and the GM are basically the same.

266
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:09,240
Speaker 0: You're just monster fighting played descent instead, but that is neither here nor there.

267
00:18:10,062 --> 00:18:16,903
Speaker 1: My worry is that the statements from Wizards of the coast About this.

268
00:18:17,324 --> 00:18:21,880
Speaker 1: they seem to be talking about how they want the game to be more inclusive and more accessible.

269
00:18:22,941 --> 00:18:24,467
Speaker 0: How is it not inclusive or accessible?

270
00:18:24,527 --> 00:18:27,960
Speaker 1: I know they've pretty much streamlined everything to the point where it's almost trivial to play.

271
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,920
Speaker 1: I mean you could replace it with a computer game for them.

272
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,080
Speaker 0: You can make it, you know, like inspectors where it's a simple game where there's hardly any rules.

273
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:40,100
Speaker 1: So they seem to be going down this path where they're going to have a simple rule set that then you add.

274
00:18:40,382 --> 00:18:42,920
Speaker 0: I mean, are they gonna make it like Raven long as you go along?

275
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:46,470
Speaker 1: Like oh, I want more complex rules for fighting BAM.

276
00:18:46,570 --> 00:18:48,960
Speaker 1: I want more complex rules for XYZ BAM BAM.

277
00:18:49,441 --> 00:18:59,900
Speaker 0: This is the fundamental problem with D&D compared to other you know, any game out there is that they seem to have this business model They won't get away from which is sell fucking tons of books, right?

278
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:08,794
Speaker 0: So we need to have a game that fits with the model of sell a lot of stuff and keep coming out with new stuff And keep selling more stuff, you know, every other RPG in the world is.

279
00:19:09,155 --> 00:19:09,857
Speaker 0: I bought the book.

280
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:11,984
Speaker 0: I Have the game now.

281
00:19:12,165 --> 00:19:13,189
Speaker 1: Here's a side analogy.

282
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:15,899
Speaker 1: This is a problem that Lego bricks have to this day.

283
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:22,520
Speaker 1: Pretty much every Lego brick in existence that wasn't eaten by a child or a dog is still in existence.

284
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:25,028
Speaker 1: They're pretty much indestructible.

285
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:27,640
Speaker 1: So there's a surplus of Legos.

286
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:34,320
Speaker 1: It actually becomes more and more difficult to sell Regular Lego because most people have a collection from childhood still that they give to their kids.

287
00:19:34,581 --> 00:19:38,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, I want to read some quotes from the actual announcement.

288
00:19:39,441 --> 00:19:41,500
Speaker 1: official announcement from Hasbro.

289
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:52,971
Speaker 1: We seek to build a foundation for the long-term health and growth of D&D One rooted in the vital traits that make D&D unique and special.

290
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:54,294
Speaker 0: It's not unique or special.

291
00:19:54,314 --> 00:19:58,560
Speaker 1: You want a game that rises above differences in play styles.

292
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:00,624
Speaker 0: Okay, that all right.

293
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:01,266
Speaker 1: I got to interrupt.

294
00:20:01,387 --> 00:20:03,915
Speaker 1: I got that is the opposite of what you should say.

295
00:20:03,975 --> 00:20:04,397
Speaker 1: and do?

296
00:20:04,778 --> 00:20:08,369
Speaker 1: you don't want a Game that's so generic that it fits every play style.

297
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:09,593
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically.

298
00:20:09,894 --> 00:20:11,519
Speaker 0: yeah, this isn't even any rules here here.

299
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:12,483
Speaker 0: here I got it.

300
00:20:12,564 --> 00:20:12,865
Speaker 0: I got it.

301
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,294
Speaker 0: I got the new edition of D&D.

302
00:20:14,334 --> 00:20:14,656
Speaker 0: I found it.

303
00:20:14,696 --> 00:20:15,280
Speaker 0: It's in my pocket.

304
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,565
Speaker 0: It's an index card.

305
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,100
Speaker 0: It says tell stories with your friends about dragons and dungeons.

306
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,765
Speaker 0: Sometimes roll dice.

307
00:20:22,086 --> 00:20:25,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see sometimes roll dice is key because we did our panel and you know what?

308
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,023
Speaker 0: That's the whole book.

309
00:20:26,084 --> 00:20:27,852
Speaker 0: and then the rest ever is just expansions.

310
00:20:27,912 --> 00:20:28,957
Speaker 0: buy whatever expansions you want.

311
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:29,439
Speaker 0: They had rules.

312
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:42,559
Speaker 1: They also want a game that rises above campaign settings and additions one that takes the fundamental essence of D&D and Brings it to the forefront of the game in shorts.

313
00:20:43,021 --> 00:20:46,653
Speaker 1: We want a game that is as simple or complex as you please.

314
00:20:47,014 --> 00:20:48,860
Speaker 1: it's action focused on combat.

315
00:20:49,561 --> 00:20:55,475
Speaker 1: Yeah Intrigue, it's already focused on combat and exploration as much as you desire.

316
00:20:55,495 --> 00:20:56,538
Speaker 1: now, wait a minute.

317
00:20:56,578 --> 00:20:56,980
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

318
00:20:57,501 --> 00:21:04,340
Speaker 1: They said they want a game that transcends all differences in play styles that is focused on combat intrigue and exploration these three specific things.

319
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:06,002
Speaker 0: So it's not really.

320
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:15,427
Speaker 0: it's only focused on the combat intrigue exploration play style and They've already contradicted themselves and again transcend editions.

321
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:20,450
Speaker 1: yet They're calling it fifth edition, but they're talking about a long term.

322
00:21:21,092 --> 00:21:23,683
Speaker 1: So why didn't they call it final edition?

323
00:21:23,924 --> 00:21:24,928
Speaker 0: or why don't they just call it?

324
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,768
Speaker 1: dungeons and dragons?

325
00:21:28,293 --> 00:21:30,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe they brand it as the reboots the.

326
00:21:31,693 --> 00:21:35,124
Speaker 0: What it's gonna be more like is it's gonna be a lot like they're very there.

327
00:21:35,164 --> 00:21:40,882
Speaker 0: No, they're very successful like, you know You know like Ravenloft and a shard alone, whatever.

328
00:21:41,123 --> 00:21:45,437
Speaker 0: I hate those games so much It's gonna be that sort of simplified rule set.

329
00:21:45,477 --> 00:21:46,039
Speaker 0: those aren't.

330
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:48,547
Speaker 1: those are not by the definitions we use in lectures.

331
00:21:48,608 --> 00:21:50,169
Speaker 1: role-playing games They're good games.

332
00:21:50,651 --> 00:21:52,477
Speaker 0: They're gonna take a simplified rule set.

333
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:59,363
Speaker 0: They're gonna remove all the proper nouns and flavor Right to create this sort of generic system.

334
00:21:59,424 --> 00:22:11,568
Speaker 0: So it'll just be like, you know Hey to fight roll numbers and dice and then there'll be books that are like Okay, you want to do Forgotten Realms or here classes for Forgotten Realms.

335
00:22:11,909 --> 00:22:14,897
Speaker 1: I want Option.

336
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,490
Speaker 1: and then this elf book, right?

337
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:18,236
Speaker 0: So here's the setting that actually gives.

338
00:22:18,277 --> 00:22:26,150
Speaker 0: here's a set of proper nouns if you want to play like this and here's a set of Proper nouns if you want to play like that, but all the rules are you know, here's the fight rule.

339
00:22:26,250 --> 00:22:37,159
Speaker 0: Here's the escape from things and whether you're escaping from a dungeon of metal bars or a dungeon with laser Shields in the spaceship now same thing.

340
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:48,110
Speaker 1: That's pretty crap because there are already systems that are like that and Generic rule sets with different proper nouns do not different games make by any stretch.

341
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,537
Speaker 1: There's no like mechanism design.

342
00:22:50,578 --> 00:22:54,650
Speaker 1: There's no like you need to gameplay that actually facilitates the kind of game you want to play.

343
00:22:54,730 --> 00:23:00,515
Speaker 0: Well, we know that we know that but they don't know that the people gonna play this just want to fight things for the cost Of what they're doing.

344
00:23:00,596 --> 00:23:10,224
Speaker 1: to make this mistake with D&D They could probably buy half of the indie RPG intellectual property There is in the world and just release it all under their brand.

345
00:23:10,244 --> 00:23:11,790
Speaker 0: but that means it for said made money.

346
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:13,460
Speaker 0: Right a lot of you playing it.

347
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:15,150
Speaker 1: Um, yeah, but how much money did it really make?

348
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,169
Speaker 1: How many people do you know who pirated that shit?

349
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:18,954
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing.

350
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:20,037
Speaker 0: how much money did it make?

351
00:23:20,138 --> 00:23:23,770
Speaker 0: because if it was making more money wouldn't why would they be trying fifth edition?

352
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:28,430
Speaker 0: I think that a lot of people do play fourth edition because you know about as many as played third.

353
00:23:28,430 --> 00:23:31,382
Speaker 0: It feels like that anyway based on just feeling which is nothing thing is.

354
00:23:31,502 --> 00:23:34,181
Speaker 1: most people I see a gaming events are playing 3.5 or Pathfinder.

355
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:41,250
Speaker 0: Well, I think that they are much less successful at selling the tons of extra books for fourth edition.

356
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,336
Speaker 0: Which is the real reason they're doing fifth edition?

357
00:23:43,356 --> 00:23:48,030
Speaker 0: because even though people are playing fourth edition, they're not making more money off.

358
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:50,799
Speaker 0: It's like they finish making money off it and they need.

359
00:23:50,819 --> 00:24:04,864
Speaker 0: they can't get people to say buy another fourth edition supplement book for a new Palette ng whatever whatever right and they they're already did all the campaign settings They could do that people care about if they make up a new one.

360
00:24:04,904 --> 00:24:06,070
Speaker 0: No one's gonna give a shit about it.

361
00:24:06,352 --> 00:24:13,710
Speaker 0: They're also and that's why they've started making you know D&D board games like the Raven loft and such because they couldn't sell more for that book.

362
00:24:13,810 --> 00:24:16,790
Speaker 0: So those have to go to fit that and those can't be pirated that easily.

363
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:18,330
Speaker 1: I mean they can be but it's pain in the ass.

364
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,881
Speaker 0: The only way to make more money is to come out with another Ed's.

365
00:24:20,921 --> 00:24:25,502
Speaker 0: you can sell another book because so need to make money Every quarter because they're a business that's you know public.

366
00:24:25,803 --> 00:24:35,210
Speaker 1: They're also committed to Getting play testing and building by consensus and getting you know criticism and it's gonna be focused group to shit.

367
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,289
Speaker 0: That's that's like listening to what the people in the tribes and counter-strike forums say to do.

368
00:24:39,872 --> 00:24:42,870
Speaker 0: Guess what it counter-strike didn't listen to the people and they're still around.

369
00:24:43,473 --> 00:24:44,137
Speaker 0: Listen to the people.

370
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:45,002
Speaker 0: they're dead quotes.

371
00:24:45,083 --> 00:24:50,890
Speaker 1: by involving you in this process We can build a set of D&D rules that incorporate the wants and desires of D&D gamers around the world.

372
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:51,733
Speaker 0: Yeah, you listen, you don't.

373
00:24:52,336 --> 00:24:56,030
Speaker 0: I think D&D needs to do the you know, Nintendo Blue Ocean, right?

374
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:57,877
Speaker 0: Fuck the D&D gamer.

375
00:24:58,058 --> 00:25:01,230
Speaker 0: you got to make something that the non the other people will do.

376
00:25:01,350 --> 00:25:03,256
Speaker 1: No, but then take D&D.

377
00:25:03,296 --> 00:25:03,938
Speaker 0: gamers will do it.

378
00:25:04,079 --> 00:25:07,530
Speaker 1: Anyway, so take D&D and make the fucking beer and pretzels.

379
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:09,598
Speaker 1: that is what most people actually want out of D&D.

380
00:25:09,618 --> 00:25:27,839
Speaker 1: because I want to point out at magfest where you're in this panel discussion on gamer motivations and The whole thing got turned around when we asked the open question to the audience along the lines of how many of you would Like want to play games where there is no conflict where you don't actually want a test of skill or competition of any kind We thought everyone in the room would say no.

381
00:25:28,441 --> 00:25:31,228
Speaker 1: the majority of the people in the room said yes That's exactly what I want.

382
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,444
Speaker 1: Yeah D&D is kind of the same way.

383
00:25:33,484 --> 00:25:34,190
Speaker 1: look at role-playing.

384
00:25:34,833 --> 00:25:38,550
Speaker 1: All the game masters want to run these crazy systems that do very specific cool things.

385
00:25:39,053 --> 00:25:41,126
Speaker 1: The average player wants beer and pretzels.

386
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:49,670
Speaker 0: D&D People do not actually you know Only hardcore people actually want to compete and test skills and battle for reals and have smart things.

387
00:25:49,991 --> 00:25:54,850
Speaker 0: People just want to sit around to go lo lo lo lo, I'm dumb and I don't care Angry Birds.

388
00:25:55,293 --> 00:25:57,206
Speaker 0: You know Farmville, we they should make.

389
00:25:57,307 --> 00:25:59,137
Speaker 0: in fact That's what I think D&D should do.

390
00:25:59,178 --> 00:26:02,733
Speaker 0: if they want to sell a lot don't make Wow D&D right.

391
00:26:02,773 --> 00:26:04,739
Speaker 0: make Farmville D&D.

392
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:07,005
Speaker 0: just fucking level that shit up.

393
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:07,707
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

394
00:26:07,747 --> 00:26:08,449
Speaker 1: There's money in that.

395
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:15,142
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now I quote the D&D experience, which is an event will be moving to Jenkon in 2013.

396
00:26:15,142 --> 00:26:18,950
Speaker 1: Okay So as the convention special this year, they'll be doing open playtesting.

397
00:26:19,671 --> 00:26:20,729
Speaker 1: And then here's another bad quote.

398
00:26:21,390 --> 00:26:22,050
Speaker 1: "Through our website...".

399
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:25,210
Speaker 0: So you won't have to buy tickets at Gen Con specifically for the playtest?

400
00:26:25,594 --> 00:26:25,966
Speaker 1: I don't know.

401
00:26:26,310 --> 00:26:26,483
Speaker 1: Yeah.

402
00:26:27,550 --> 00:26:35,809
Speaker 1: "Through our website, we will release a growing set of rules, classes, monsters, and other materials for your study and

403
00:26:35,829 --> 00:26:36,030
Speaker 1: feedback.".

404
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:38,390
Speaker 0: So it's still based on classes and monsters.

405
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:39,599
Speaker 0: It's still D&D.

406
00:26:40,491 --> 00:26:41,506
Speaker 1: Well, they said it's still D&D.

407
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:48,490
Speaker 1: They want it to be uniquely still D&D while making it as generic and non-D&D as possible.

408
00:26:50,291 --> 00:26:51,845
Speaker 1: Uh, guys, you're fucking this up.

409
00:26:51,886 --> 00:26:52,310
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

410
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:56,469
Speaker 1: I have no choice but to shit all over this at this stage.

411
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:05,871
Speaker 1: So, things of the day.

412
00:27:05,972 --> 00:27:06,434
Speaker 1: Why?

413
00:27:06,454 --> 00:27:07,399
Speaker 1: Why, Bidoof?

414
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:08,063
Speaker 0: Why?

415
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,435
Speaker 1: Why would you do this to me, Mr.

416
00:27:10,475 --> 00:27:10,758
Speaker 1: Bidoof?

417
00:27:11,384 --> 00:27:12,059
Speaker 0: Oh, he's got a knife.

418
00:27:12,301 --> 00:27:13,638
Speaker 0: Oh my god, he threw it at me.

419
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,859
Speaker 0: Oh, but he missed.

420
00:27:15,660 --> 00:27:16,210
Speaker 1: Oh, Bidoof.

421
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,258
Speaker 1: He's got a gun.

422
00:27:18,442 --> 00:27:20,240
Speaker 1: I saw this a while ago and it was funny.

423
00:27:20,261 --> 00:27:20,920
Speaker 0: No, I think that's enough.

424
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,397
Speaker 1: It was funny, but I forgot about it.

425
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:23,582
Speaker 0: Oh, Bidoof.

426
00:27:23,824 --> 00:27:24,428
Speaker 0: He's so angry.

427
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:26,039
Speaker 0: It's as angry as Bidoof's ever been.

428
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:30,019
Speaker 1: Our friend Adam brought it up and we remembered it.

429
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:33,117
Speaker 1: And it's this kind of slow burn video where you watch it.

430
00:27:33,137 --> 00:27:33,600
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny.

431
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,253
Speaker 0: You don't need to describe it.

432
00:27:34,273 --> 00:27:34,580
Speaker 0: That's it.

433
00:27:35,347 --> 00:27:36,440
Speaker 1: No, I can explain something.

434
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:37,300
Speaker 0: There's nothing to explain.

435
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,899
Speaker 0: There's an interesting phenomenon you'll see.

436
00:27:39,060 --> 00:27:39,706
Speaker 0: Bidoof, why?

437
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:40,373
Speaker 0: Bidoof, the end.

438
00:27:40,474 --> 00:27:41,060
Speaker 0: My thing of the day.

439
00:27:41,261 --> 00:27:42,219
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny, right?

440
00:27:42,782 --> 00:27:46,200
Speaker 1: But as time goes on, like, you're gonna... It's a slow burn.

441
00:27:46,463 --> 00:27:46,947
Speaker 0: You're doing the.

442
00:27:46,967 --> 00:27:48,260
Speaker 0: dub this, explain the joke, attend the panel.

443
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:51,859
Speaker 1: And it'll be funnier and funnier the more you think about it.

444
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,579
Speaker 0: Adam, why don't you add another panel to that bad webcomic?

445
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,820
Speaker 1: And I guarantee that within a few days, you will be doing the same thing that we did with Dinosaur Office.

446
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,260
Speaker 0: Hey, why did chicken cross the road?

447
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,659
Speaker 1: Which is talking just like the guy who got fucked up by Mr.

448
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:05,840
Speaker 1: Bidoof.

449
00:28:05,921 --> 00:28:06,679
Speaker 1: To get to the other side.

450
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:09,100
Speaker 0: Oh, you see, it's funny because the answer was obvious.

451
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,699
Speaker 0: You thought it was gonna be like a joke answer.

452
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:11,616
Speaker 1: Scott, what did you think of the day?

453
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:11,820
Speaker 0: Come on.

454
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:12,650
Speaker 0: The common sense thing.

455
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:13,380
Speaker 0: Why would a chicken cross the road?

456
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,173
Speaker 1: Come on, what did you think of the day?

457
00:28:14,214 --> 00:28:14,458
Speaker 1: Let's go.

458
00:28:14,902 --> 00:28:20,840
Speaker 0: So, you know, if you got an Apple computer, right, there's many ways to get softwares into it.

459
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:26,960
Speaker 0: You can do what I do sometimes, which is, I have this modem cable and it connects to a serial port in the computer.

460
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:30,160
Speaker 0: So the Apple thinks it's dialing the internets on a modem.

461
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:32,919
Speaker 0: Well, not the internets, but it thinks it's dialing the internet.

462
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:40,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, it thinks it's dialing the modem and receiving software, but really it's my computer sending the software, pretending to be a modem on a serial port, sending software to the Apple.

463
00:28:40,931 --> 00:28:42,060
Speaker 0: that's on a file on my hard drive.

464
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:45,738
Speaker 1: Now you kids are all thinking right now, "Why don't I do that to those ATMs that are plugged into a phone

465
00:28:45,779 --> 00:28:45,920
Speaker 1: line?".

466
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,306
Speaker 1: You know what?

467
00:28:46,327 --> 00:28:47,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, go for it.

468
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,740
Speaker 0: Well, the modem cable on an Apple II GS is like this weird connector.

469
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:52,640
Speaker 0: It's not a phone connector.

470
00:28:52,860 --> 00:28:53,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway.

471
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:57,880
Speaker 0: Another thing you can do is you can get floppy disk drives, either the five and a quarter or the three and a half.

472
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,579
Speaker 0: You can also get hard drives.

473
00:28:59,982 --> 00:29:01,920
Speaker 0: You can get all sorts of crazy shit, right?

474
00:29:02,521 --> 00:29:08,660
Speaker 0: But one thing you could always do is do the tape recorder, where you get the tape recorder, you get software on an audio cassette, right?

475
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,020
Speaker 0: You type load and you push play on the tape and you wait for the tape to play.

476
00:29:12,525 --> 00:29:13,700
Speaker 0: And then the software is loaded.

477
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,180
Speaker 0: And it's just like the modem.

478
00:29:15,521 --> 00:29:17,200
Speaker 1: You can even do that with the Atari.

479
00:29:17,561 --> 00:29:20,060
Speaker 1: I had a cassette that had a whole bunch of Atari games on it.

480
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:28,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just like a modem because it goes... And if you basically put that tape recorder in a regular old audio tape player, that's what it sounds like.

481
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,040
Speaker 1: I don't actually know what format it uses.

482
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,400
Speaker 1: I imagine it's something like QAM, but I'm not sure.

483
00:29:33,741 --> 00:29:34,378
Speaker 0: Right, so check this out.

484
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,220
Speaker 0: There's a website, askiexpress.net/gameserver.

485
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,479
Speaker 0: And what this website is is a list of Apple II games.

486
00:29:41,983 --> 00:29:47,598
Speaker 0: So you go down the list and you click on a game here, Horizon V. So I clicked on Horizon V and it loads and...

487
00:29:47,942 --> 00:29:48,118
Speaker 1: WAV file?

488
00:29:48,961 --> 00:29:50,820
Speaker 0: Some WAV files and some Flash players.

489
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:57,580
Speaker 0: So what you can do is you can even get your iPhone or something, or your phone, you know, or just your laptop or whatever.

490
00:29:58,901 --> 00:30:15,640
Speaker 0: Go to this website, take a regular old three and a half inch audio cable from your phone or whatever it is, audio device, turn the volume all the way up, connect this to the back of the Apple computer, you know, the Apple II GS, type load, press play on your phone, and the game loads from the internet.

491
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:20,340
Speaker 0: So you can basically download games from the internet to play them on your Apple II immediately.

492
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:23,260
Speaker 0: And I have an Apple II, so I might do this shit.

493
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:26,540
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of fucking games here, a lot.

494
00:30:27,020 --> 00:30:35,180
Speaker 0: Super Othello, oh shit son, Stunt Cycle Tron, Xevious, Penzate, O'Reilly's Mine.

495
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,600
Speaker 1: All right, I found the interface.

496
00:30:37,741 --> 00:30:41,460
Speaker 1: It's actually pretty interesting how it works, and it's way simpler than I expected.

497
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,940
Speaker 0: It's pretty simple, it's pretty much this noise for one, this noise for zero.

498
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:49,620
Speaker 1: The header consists of ten seconds of a seven hundred and seventy hertz tone, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

499
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:51,220
Speaker 1: I'll link to this too because it's pretty interesting.

500
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:54,400
Speaker 0: All right, but yeah, I'm going to try this because I have an Apple II.

501
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:58,000
Speaker 0: If you don't have an Apple II, maybe try this with an Apple II emulator.

502
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:03,160
Speaker 0: It might work, maybe it takes like audio input from the microphone and you can just do an analog hole situation.

503
00:31:03,582 --> 00:31:08,760
Speaker 1: Now, if you're hardcore, do a ROM hack on the audio to make the game different.

504
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:18,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, download the WAV file and then write a program that will convert the WAV file into the floppy disk file that you could then take an image of to run in the emulator.

505
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,199
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, we already talked about PAX, but suffice it to say, we will be at PAX East.

506
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:26,640
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we don't have any big conventions on the horizon.

507
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:27,420
Speaker 1: Anime Boston.

508
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:29,180
Speaker 0: Same weekend as PAX East.

509
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,719
Speaker 1: Same weekend as PAX East, there may or may not be a shuttle between the two.

510
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:36,300
Speaker 1: And Anime Boston does have one advantage over PAX East.

511
00:31:36,460 --> 00:31:39,520
Speaker 1: There are more better restaurants near it, but they cost more money.

512
00:31:39,961 --> 00:31:40,740
Speaker 0: But it goes later.

513
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:41,618
Speaker 1: It does.

514
00:31:41,860 --> 00:31:43,936
Speaker 0: So when PAX is over at like 2

515
00:31:43,936 --> 00:31:44,198
Speaker 0: a.m.,

516
00:31:44,561 --> 00:31:47,060
Speaker 0: I think Anime Boston still might have some programming.

517
00:31:47,401 --> 00:31:50,081
Speaker 1: Yeah, that one part, remember, is 24/7.

518
00:31:50,081 --> 00:31:50,859
Speaker 0: A very small part.

519
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,020
Speaker 1: Including, I believe, their tabletop.

520
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:54,080
Speaker 0: Possibly.

521
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:58,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's go over to Anime Boston for some tabletop at 2 in the morning.

522
00:32:00,103 --> 00:32:04,499
Speaker 1: But we'll be at both most likely, as long as we can arrange the schedules between the two.

523
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:05,500
Speaker 0: Which might be difficult.

524
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're working with them.

525
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,239
Speaker 1: We're gonna do our level best.

526
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:09,339
Speaker 0: Other meta things.

527
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,240
Speaker 0: Nerd NYC recesses this weekend.

528
00:32:11,300 --> 00:32:15,200
Speaker 1: This weekend, Scott has to do laundry and wash his hair so he won't be there.

529
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:16,579
Speaker 0: But I... My non-hair.

530
00:32:17,182 --> 00:32:18,738
Speaker 1: I will be there on Saturday only.

531
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,520
Speaker 0: I also have to watch football.

532
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,780
Speaker 1: Well, I might be there Sunday.

533
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,400
Speaker 1: I want to go skiing on Sunday, but it's like 50 degrees.

534
00:32:25,521 --> 00:32:27,260
Speaker 0: It's not looking like you're gonna shush anything.

535
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:27,936
Speaker 0: It's not looking so good.

536
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:29,380
Speaker 0: Unless you want to shush the grass.

537
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I went to the website for the one I want to go to.

538
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,580
Speaker 1: It was like, primary surface, lose granular, which is code for shit.

539
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,180
Speaker 1: Secondary surface, uh, dirt.

540
00:32:39,481 --> 00:32:39,846
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

541
00:32:39,886 --> 00:32:40,820
Speaker 0: secondary surface?

542
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,360
Speaker 0: As in what's ever under the snow?

543
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:45,760
Speaker 1: No, well, so primary surface is like what's on most of the trails.

544
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,780
Speaker 1: Secondary surface is like what's on the rest of the trails that aren't as good as that one.

545
00:32:50,380 --> 00:32:54,839
Speaker 1: It's like where it's worn down or on the edge cases, like what's the worst condition you're gonna run into.

546
00:32:55,604 --> 00:32:58,120
Speaker 1: The secondary surface appears to be dirt, as far as I can tell.

547
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,159
Speaker 1: Maybe grass.

548
00:32:59,382 --> 00:33:00,099
Speaker 0: We'll get those dirt skis.

549
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've hit grass on my skis before.

550
00:33:02,980 --> 00:33:03,840
Speaker 1: It's not pleasant.

551
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:05,599
Speaker 1: Usually you stop and then hit your face.

552
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:07,413
Speaker 0: Face.

553
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:08,337
Speaker 0: All right.

554
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,640
Speaker 1: Otherwise, the book club book is still not one, but two books.

555
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,137
Speaker 0: That's right.

556
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:13,898
Speaker 0: It's The Little Prince.

557
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:20,279
Speaker 0: And also, the second book is Wind, Sand, and the Stars, both written by Antoine de Saint-Euperi.

558
00:33:20,983 --> 00:33:21,660
Speaker 0: I'm almost done.

559
00:33:21,821 --> 00:33:22,820
Speaker 1: The farmer is brilliant.

560
00:33:22,941 --> 00:33:24,760
Speaker 1: The ladder is breathtaking.

561
00:33:26,121 --> 00:33:29,120
Speaker 1: I am very impressed with Wind, Sand, and Stars.

562
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,680
Speaker 0: Are you done?

563
00:33:30,302 --> 00:33:30,606
Speaker 1: Mostly.

564
00:33:30,627 --> 00:33:31,580
Speaker 1: I'm like three quarters of the way through.

565
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,160
Speaker 0: So we're both about three quarters of the way through.

566
00:33:33,321 --> 00:33:33,615
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

567
00:33:34,001 --> 00:33:35,500
Speaker 0: Only, and the thing is, it's not that long.

568
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,060
Speaker 0: It's just I've been so busy.

569
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:38,560
Speaker 1: It's not that long.

570
00:33:39,123 --> 00:33:40,780
Speaker 1: I kept rereading two sections.

571
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:44,400
Speaker 0: And the other thing is like I keep getting other stuff that I keep reading instead.

572
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,394
Speaker 1: Drops of God, maybe.

573
00:33:46,163 --> 00:33:46,578
Speaker 0: Like that.

574
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:46,826
Speaker 0: Yeah.

575
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:48,160
Speaker 0: Let's do a show about that.

576
00:33:48,201 --> 00:33:48,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should.

577
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:49,240
Speaker 0: Next one.

578
00:33:50,003 --> 00:33:51,520
Speaker 0: We gotta get those DC comics out of the way.

579
00:33:51,701 --> 00:33:52,560
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

580
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:53,427
Speaker 1: DC comics.

581
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,793
Speaker 1: Why would you do this?

582
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,619
Speaker 1: The angriest DC comics has ever been.

583
00:33:59,443 --> 00:33:59,511
Speaker 0: See?

584
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,639
Speaker 0: They're up in the sky.

585
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,020
Speaker 1: I told you.

586
00:34:02,081 --> 00:34:02,920
Speaker 0: What they're doing up in that cloud.

587
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,440
Speaker 1: So Scott bought a game, and I just didn't even pay attention.

588
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,920
Speaker 1: I didn't notice this game came out or anything.

589
00:34:08,944 --> 00:34:15,676
Speaker 0: Well, all he noticed is in our forum, Timo was like, "Hey, my friend made a game called Eclipse, and he predicted that it would be pretty popular on

590
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:16,280
Speaker 0: BoardGameGeek.".

591
00:34:16,360 --> 00:34:21,518
Speaker 0: And then I go check it out, and I'm looking around, and suddenly a lot of people are talking about this game.

592
00:34:21,580 --> 00:34:26,760
Speaker 0: So a listener of our show, who we know is really cool, had a friend who made a game that became ridiculously popular.

593
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:30,380
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Whoa, it's so popular that if I go on BoardGameGeek...".

594
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:31,827
Speaker 1: It's an 8.53 out of 10 with over 1,000 rankings.

595
00:34:35,121 --> 00:34:38,360
Speaker 0: Oh my god, it is ranked number 14 on BoardGameGeek.

596
00:34:38,761 --> 00:34:41,679
Speaker 0: It's number two in its theme, and number seven in strategy games.

597
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,753
Speaker 0: That's every game there is, period.

598
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:51,300
Speaker 1: Now this list is a little skewed, because Twilight Struggle made its way to the top, and fuck that game.

599
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:57,260
Speaker 0: The average rating for, I think, it is the number one average rating, period.

600
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:58,517
Speaker 0: Let me check this.

601
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:07,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, this game is in the ranks of things like Agricola, Puerto Rico, Le Havre, Power Grid, Calus, 7 Wonders, El Grande.

602
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:12,201
Speaker 0: Okay, it doesn't have the highest average rating, because there's a whole bunch of games that have a single rating of 10.0.

603
00:35:12,201 --> 00:35:14,880
Speaker 1: Race for the Galaxy, T&E, some of the best games ever made.

604
00:35:15,001 --> 00:35:16,520
Speaker 1: It is already up there, and you know what?

605
00:35:16,621 --> 00:35:17,660
Speaker 1: It's pretty justified.

606
00:35:17,901 --> 00:35:21,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I put this game, having only played it three times, right?

607
00:35:22,441 --> 00:35:26,200
Speaker 0: I put this game as my number three game currently.

608
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,960
Speaker 1: Now, I want to preface this very clearly.

609
00:35:29,401 --> 00:35:31,340
Speaker 0: This game has some random bullshit in it.

610
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,420
Speaker 0: That's why it's number three.

611
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:40,280
Speaker 1: And as a result, it gives me the visceral enjoyment of like war games and such, but also with the mind feel.

612
00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:41,960
Speaker 1: I've decided I'm gonna start using that term.

613
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,320
Speaker 1: You know how people when they review food, they're like the mouth feel?

614
00:35:45,522 --> 00:35:47,780
Speaker 1: So the mind feel, and you know what I'm talking about.

615
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,340
Speaker 1: This feels in my mind, mostly like either a German board game or Master of Orion.

616
00:35:55,266 --> 00:35:56,119
Speaker 0: I guess you could say that.

617
00:35:56,580 --> 00:36:01,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what is Eclipse other than the biggest fucking game we own?

618
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,240
Speaker 0: So it's not the biggest game we own.

619
00:36:03,500 --> 00:36:05,100
Speaker 0: It just takes a lot of table space.

620
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:07,019
Speaker 1: Name a bigger game we own that we play.

621
00:36:08,701 --> 00:36:10,720
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, as in terms of table space?

622
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,919
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, cause Shogun has more pieces.

623
00:36:13,281 --> 00:36:13,978
Speaker 1: It's not bigger.

624
00:36:14,521 --> 00:36:16,478
Speaker 0: Space wise, the box is bigger.

625
00:36:17,301 --> 00:36:19,980
Speaker 1: Box is bigger game, not bigger anyway.

626
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:22,700
Speaker 1: Battle Masters, I guess we don't own Battle Masters.

627
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,008
Speaker 0: I do.

628
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:23,575
Speaker 0: Okay.

629
00:36:24,122 --> 00:36:25,599
Speaker 0: Battle Masters is the biggest game there is.

630
00:36:26,682 --> 00:36:28,440
Speaker 0: So here's the deal with Eclipse, right?

631
00:36:28,661 --> 00:36:35,020
Speaker 0: Is it is Master of Orion, the board game, and it plays sort of mostly like a German board game, right?

632
00:36:35,181 --> 00:36:44,780
Speaker 0: On your turn, you take an action and, you know, and you go around taking actions sort of like, you know, Ticket to Ride or Puerto Rico or any of those games or Calus, right?

633
00:36:45,223 --> 00:36:46,420
Speaker 0: On your turn, you take an action.

634
00:36:46,541 --> 00:36:47,460
Speaker 0: On your turn, you take an action.

635
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:55,720
Speaker 0: You go around and eventually you pass and eventually everyone passes and you manage resources, you know, you've got, and you get victory points in order to win.

636
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:57,560
Speaker 0: It's not about who can conquer the galaxy or whatever.

637
00:36:57,740 --> 00:36:59,019
Speaker 0: Just get victory points to win.

638
00:36:59,442 --> 00:37:00,540
Speaker 0: The game is nine rounds.

639
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:01,140
Speaker 0: Exactly.

640
00:37:02,422 --> 00:37:03,920
Speaker 0: So you know how long it's going to take.

641
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:11,440
Speaker 0: It takes a half hour per person, but that assumes set up time and learning time, which can be quite long depending.

642
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,816
Speaker 0: And basically it's totally awesome except for, right?

643
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:26,680
Speaker 0: The thing that makes it not German is that you have space combat and space combat is a lot like combat in a lot of other, you know, war games.

644
00:37:27,324 --> 00:37:28,719
Speaker 0: But like it's very risk-ish.

645
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to sell you on the space combat right now.

646
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:34,159
Speaker 1: The way this works, and this is what made this game awesome for me.

647
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:36,380
Speaker 1: You've got four classes of ships.

648
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,120
Speaker 1: Three of them are ships and one is the space station.

649
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:38,617
Speaker 1: They can't move.

650
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:39,419
Speaker 0: Starbase.

651
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:42,320
Speaker 1: You play inventory Tetris.

652
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,659
Speaker 1: Well, basically in this case, it's upgrade Tetris.

653
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:53,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the little ship, if you build 10 of them, they're all of the same loadout, which is matching whatever loadout you've built on your character sheet.

654
00:37:54,001 --> 00:37:59,080
Speaker 1: They come with like one kind of engine, one kind of gun, and you can put shit in this extra space.

655
00:37:59,160 --> 00:38:00,200
Speaker 1: You can upgrade stuff.

656
00:38:00,725 --> 00:38:02,319
Speaker 1: It's pretty flexible in what you want to build.

657
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,560
Speaker 1: And that alone is way fun.

658
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:13,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, and what's really, you know, it's also like incredibly like tense because you'll be sitting there ready to go into battle and you're like, I got this.

659
00:38:14,321 --> 00:38:15,820
Speaker 0: The other guy upgrades his shit.

660
00:38:16,122 --> 00:38:18,940
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, that completely changed the odds.

661
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,460
Speaker 0: I don't got the first game.

662
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,680
Speaker 0: So now it's like, well, should I build more ships or upgrade my ships?

663
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:26,740
Speaker 0: Will that make it a winnable battle?

664
00:38:27,682 --> 00:38:32,418
Speaker 0: And like there was the greatest thing happened, like in the last game I played, it was a three player game and that I won.

665
00:38:34,701 --> 00:38:37,740
Speaker 0: Me and Pete were like, he was in the middle and I was just outside the middle.

666
00:38:38,601 --> 00:38:43,098
Speaker 0: And I'm building up a big army and he's building up a giant army, just two adjacent hexes all in.

667
00:38:43,781 --> 00:38:48,060
Speaker 0: And it's like putting in more ships, more ships, more sugar.

668
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,359
Speaker 1: That's a lot of ships.

669
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,959
Speaker 0: Upgrade the ships, anti-matter cannon, boom, boom, boom, make them real big.

670
00:38:53,442 --> 00:38:58,218
Speaker 0: And then it's pretty much like, I was pretty much like, well, I just had to put enough in there that he wouldn't attack me.

671
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:06,740
Speaker 0: He, I only had to make it, I wasted only one action to bluff to make it look like I was going in no matter what, so that he would waste actions defending.

672
00:39:07,621 --> 00:39:12,279
Speaker 0: And then I use the remaining actions to get victory points elsewhere because you win with victory points.

673
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:13,198
Speaker 0: It's not Shogun.

674
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:16,480
Speaker 0: You don't win by killing the other guy, even though that could get you some victory points.

675
00:39:16,882 --> 00:39:17,900
Speaker 0: You win with victory points.

676
00:39:18,001 --> 00:39:20,540
Speaker 0: I just explored some new space and got points elsewhere.

677
00:39:21,245 --> 00:39:23,279
Speaker 0: And then it was just like, oh, no, that's it.

678
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:27,059
Speaker 1: The only game I ever played, I won and I did the same thing.

679
00:39:28,442 --> 00:39:31,159
Speaker 1: Someone was going to attack me like pretty much straight up.

680
00:39:31,425 --> 00:39:31,939
Speaker 0: Run away.

681
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:36,860
Speaker 1: No, I upgraded a bunch of ships and kind of like menaced him a little bit.

682
00:39:37,505 --> 00:39:38,400
Speaker 1: And that caused a standoff.

683
00:39:38,522 --> 00:39:39,960
Speaker 1: And then I just farm victory points elsewhere.

684
00:39:40,561 --> 00:39:43,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, because everyone's actually really afraid to lose their ships.

685
00:39:44,534 --> 00:39:44,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

686
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:58,059
Speaker 0: Well, it's the thing is, right, is that, you know, despite, you know, the fact that you can get victory points in so many different ways that you don't even need to do ships is that if someone comes on you with ships, they can take away, right?

687
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,679
Speaker 0: Number one, your hexes.

688
00:39:59,921 --> 00:40:02,420
Speaker 0: Every hex that you control is worth at least one victory point.

689
00:40:02,521 --> 00:40:04,980
Speaker 0: So having less hexes under your control is bad.

690
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:14,000
Speaker 0: Number two, when you lose hexes, the cubes on the board that are on that hex come off and that makes you weaker, which makes it harder for you to do anything.

691
00:40:15,061 --> 00:40:20,300
Speaker 0: And number three, if you lose all your hexes, then you're out of the game, basically.

692
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:28,079
Speaker 1: So the first game of this I played, when I say mouthfeel, there's one other feel that I got a little bit, but it might have been circumstantial.

693
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:36,760
Speaker 1: And that was our old Battletech days because we started that game of Eclipse after midnight at Magfest.

694
00:40:37,062 --> 00:40:39,960
Speaker 1: And we stopped at five in the morning.

695
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,528
Speaker 0: We stopped at four something and got.

696
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:43,640
Speaker 1: we stopped at five forty five or so.

697
00:40:43,823 --> 00:40:44,820
Speaker 0: We got to bed at five.

698
00:40:45,060 --> 00:40:48,940
Speaker 1: I tweeted my victory at five fifteen before I took a shower and passed out.

699
00:40:49,301 --> 00:40:50,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's better.

700
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,439
Speaker 1: It was a pretty good game, though.

701
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:53,039
Speaker 1: So rather than, you know.

702
00:40:53,300 --> 00:40:57,420
Speaker 0: But if you think about it, right, six people, right, playing half hour each.

703
00:40:57,803 --> 00:40:59,260
Speaker 0: It's three hours teaching.

704
00:40:59,381 --> 00:41:01,279
Speaker 1: We had to add in teaching and setting up.

705
00:41:01,661 --> 00:41:04,879
Speaker 0: So it took us, you know, three hours and change.

706
00:41:05,522 --> 00:41:08,600
Speaker 0: You know, we started at one something and we ended it for something.

707
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:11,680
Speaker 1: So we're not going to explain the rules because you can read the rules and play the game.

708
00:41:12,863 --> 00:41:16,080
Speaker 1: I think we can bring up all the like the individual interesting mechanics.

709
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:16,740
Speaker 0: Here's the number one.

710
00:41:17,161 --> 00:41:20,000
Speaker 0: Here's the number one awesome thing that I was like, oh, shit, son.

711
00:41:20,142 --> 00:41:20,253
Speaker 0: Right.

712
00:41:20,703 --> 00:41:20,998
Speaker 0: The cubes.

713
00:41:21,562 --> 00:41:25,240
Speaker 0: You have these tracks on your board that have cubes covering them completely.

714
00:41:25,901 --> 00:41:29,720
Speaker 0: And it tells you how much money, how much science and how much materials you make.

715
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:34,177
Speaker 0: Money's used for actions and science, used for science upgrades and materials used to build ships.

716
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:41,120
Speaker 0: And basically, as your empire grows, you put cubes on the board, their population cubes.

717
00:41:41,541 --> 00:41:51,240
Speaker 0: So when you put a science population cube on the board, right, that decreases the number of population cubes on your personal board.

718
00:41:51,500 --> 00:41:56,519
Speaker 0: So the number on your personal board that's bigger is now revealed because you remove the cube.

719
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,819
Speaker 1: So think about the elegance of this.

720
00:41:57,940 --> 00:42:05,440
Speaker 1: Rather than most games that the exploration and exploitation, you will get a space and then get points out of it every round to spend.

721
00:42:05,841 --> 00:42:14,360
Speaker 1: This is the same mathematical mechanic, but the mechanism of doing it in the board game is taking one cube off of your board and putting it on the space.

722
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:18,220
Speaker 1: Giving away cubes is tantamount to getting resources regularly.

723
00:42:19,348 --> 00:42:20,740
Speaker 0: The physicality is reversed.

724
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,580
Speaker 0: Normally in another game, it'd be like, you got science points here.

725
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,960
Speaker 0: Take a fist full of science points.

726
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,740
Speaker 1: This physical or it would have, you know, sliders.

727
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:35,978
Speaker 0: This is like I put a scientist from my personal board onto a hex in outer space, and now I get more science every turn.

728
00:42:36,421 --> 00:42:46,780
Speaker 1: This game, by using very clever physical design, was able to greatly increase the complexity of the board game without making it no longer a playable board game.

729
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:50,080
Speaker 0: It's not as complex as actual Master of Orion, right?

730
00:42:50,240 --> 00:43:00,660
Speaker 0: Not even close, but it is plenty complex, and they've managed to compress compact it into less physical bits so that it's actually manageable as a board game.

731
00:43:00,700 --> 00:43:05,393
Speaker 0: And you can actually get the whole game in your brain playing Master of Orion or even Civilization V or IV.

732
00:43:06,302 --> 00:43:08,040
Speaker 0: It's hard to get the whole game in your brain.

733
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:11,020
Speaker 0: There's a lot of tiny, tiny stuff that can only be done on a computer.

734
00:43:11,300 --> 00:43:13,400
Speaker 0: Like, how many grain are in that one city?

735
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:14,780
Speaker 0: I've got 20 cities, right?

736
00:43:14,820 --> 00:43:25,940
Speaker 1: This is why I always recommend when people want to learn game theory or study games or game design or anything like that is to do board games because the physical limitations of the design force you to consider...

737
00:43:25,940 --> 00:43:30,900
Speaker 0: When you're playing Master of Orion, you've got a thousand ships that all have different equipment because they don't automatically upgrade.

738
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,880
Speaker 1: Yep, so imagine trying to design a game like Master of Orion.

739
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:37,060
Speaker 1: You couldn't even get it in your head to design it.

740
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,660
Speaker 1: It would take so much playtesting and time.

741
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,620
Speaker 0: Let alone to even play the combat.

742
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:43,920
Speaker 0: It's like, how do you even make decisions, you know, in that kind of situation?

743
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:54,640
Speaker 1: Another really great mechanic is that the way your upkeep increases is that every time you take an action, you take a disc off of your board and put it on the action you took.

744
00:43:55,620 --> 00:43:58,820
Speaker 1: You also take discs off the board and put them on hexes you control.

745
00:43:59,581 --> 00:44:07,219
Speaker 1: The more things you control or do, the more upkeep there is because there are increasingly negative numbers under those discs.

746
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,559
Speaker 0: So the bigger your empire is, it's harder for you to take more actions unless you have a lot more money.

747
00:44:13,120 --> 00:44:14,700
Speaker 0: You need money to do more actions.

748
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:17,880
Speaker 1: Or you can go for it by burning and losing other stuff.

749
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:19,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can.

750
00:44:20,342 --> 00:44:34,010
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's a science economy of building resource enhancements and improvements and tracks and it's basically got one little piece of all those kinds of space explorer fighty games that everyone loves in one game.

751
00:44:34,030 --> 00:44:36,220
Speaker 1: that is a board game that's actually playable.

752
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:43,240
Speaker 0: It's like when you want to explore outer space to conquer new territory, you flip over new hexes of outer space and add them to the board.

753
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:49,220
Speaker 0: When you want to, you know, every turn we grab more science tiles out of the bag as new sciences are available.

754
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,961
Speaker 0: So you might be playing with a particular strategy and that science just doesn't come up.

755
00:44:53,001 --> 00:44:56,140
Speaker 0: or the one game I played, the wrench just never appeared, the nanobots.

756
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:03,420
Speaker 0: It's like I wanted to buy nanobots immediately in that game, but they weren't available till very late in the game, even though the most basic technology.

757
00:45:03,945 --> 00:45:04,759
Speaker 0: And it's like, why?

758
00:45:05,020 --> 00:45:07,480
Speaker 0: Because there's some randomness there that makes every game different.

759
00:45:07,901 --> 00:45:13,378
Speaker 0: But, you know, the randomness, there is randomness, though, which is, you know, somewhat annoying is the hex draw, right?

760
00:45:13,560 --> 00:45:16,899
Speaker 0: If you get a really good hex draw and you explore a lot, it's going to help you.

761
00:45:18,421 --> 00:45:25,098
Speaker 0: If you if sciences come up that happen to help you and it happens to be you going first this time, it helps you.

762
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:30,700
Speaker 0: You know, if you're in a combat and the other guy happens to roll four sixes, it's happened already, even though you've only played three games.

763
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:31,618
Speaker 0: It's happened a few times.

764
00:45:32,082 --> 00:45:34,480
Speaker 0: Well, you might get fucked even though your military is a barrier.

765
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:39,040
Speaker 1: This is a situation where typically games that have a lot of randomness are pretty crappy.

766
00:45:39,382 --> 00:45:41,460
Speaker 1: And as the randomness goes away, the games get better.

767
00:45:42,021 --> 00:45:46,435
Speaker 1: And then there's a point at which there's no or no functional randomness left in the game.

768
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:53,840
Speaker 1: And these are games like chess and checkers and go or Puerto Rico, where there's functionally other than the state of the plantations, no randomness.

769
00:45:54,920 --> 00:46:02,600
Speaker 1: But then if you keep going, there's this whole other spectrum of games that have randomness because they're more like simulations of real things.

770
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:05,175
Speaker 1: I mean, war has a lot of random B.S.

771
00:46:05,215 --> 00:46:05,900
Speaker 1: that happens in it.

772
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:13,055
Speaker 0: So even if you have the best strategy of war, you know, no matter what you do, shit could happen.

773
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,842
Speaker 0: And that's why, you know, football, real life football or sports, you know, all sports have the.

774
00:46:18,147 --> 00:46:19,079
Speaker 0: we got the perfect game plan.

775
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:19,979
Speaker 0: We got the perfect players.

776
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,580
Speaker 0: We got the perfect matchups to get the perfect plays and randomness happen.

777
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:25,299
Speaker 1: And there's value in those games, too.

778
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:28,060
Speaker 1: I mean, war games and historical simulations are great kinds of games.

779
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:32,640
Speaker 1: And this game is just past that threshold where it's starting to have the randomness.

780
00:46:33,122 --> 00:46:40,760
Speaker 1: that actually makes the game fun and interesting, even though it makes it less good of a game from a purely strategic mathematical game theory.

781
00:46:40,981 --> 00:46:41,545
Speaker 0: It's like.

782
00:46:41,565 --> 00:46:43,920
Speaker 0: I still love the game and want to play it like crazy.

783
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:55,978
Speaker 0: But I am frustrated when I attack, you know, one measly alien ship with like four interceptors that are upgraded and I lose because someone rolled a fist full of sixes and I rolled a fist full of ones.

784
00:46:56,843 --> 00:46:57,719
Speaker 0: And that was that.

785
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:04,180
Speaker 1: But Scott, aren't you also the exact opposite of that when your one interceptor takes out like the center square?

786
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:09,454
Speaker 0: Yes, but it's incredibly frustrating nonetheless, which makes it not as good as Puerto Rico or Tini.

787
00:47:10,220 --> 00:47:17,719
Speaker 1: The only thing I can say about this game that is negative is that there aren't really a whole bunch of expansions yet for me to play with.

788
00:47:18,342 --> 00:47:18,779
Speaker 0: I don't know.

789
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,880
Speaker 0: He really needs expansions.

790
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:25,560
Speaker 0: I think the things that are negative about the game are number one, the setup time is kind of big and it's hard to clean up because you get a lot of pieces.

791
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:31,380
Speaker 1: I'd like more interesting things to run into on the hexes just for like a different flavor of game every now and then.

792
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,350
Speaker 0: Well, there is an expansion that was like.

793
00:47:33,692 --> 00:47:38,780
Speaker 0: there's one thing that's like the supernova something that you got at Essen, which we're probably never going to get.

794
00:47:39,041 --> 00:47:43,000
Speaker 0: No, but it added like supernova tiles and a supernova technology or something.

795
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:44,425
Speaker 0: There's also the discovery.

796
00:47:44,466 --> 00:47:49,800
Speaker 0: tiles are usually where all the good action is in that department, There's also a really nice mechanic of the game.

797
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,332
Speaker 1: By default, everyone plays as humans.

798
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:53,480
Speaker 1: It's the Terran something.

799
00:47:53,660 --> 00:47:59,340
Speaker 1: It's all like the Terran collective, the Terran Republic, the Terran dictatorship, the Terran democracy.

800
00:47:59,580 --> 00:48:04,860
Speaker 0: There are six player boards, each a different color, and they all have Terran on one side and an alien race on the other side.

801
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,079
Speaker 1: Terrans are all the same.

802
00:48:06,462 --> 00:48:10,180
Speaker 1: The aliens are crazy rule breakers, like they're totally all different from each other.

803
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:14,700
Speaker 0: So, for example, you know, Rims the youngest will say so he gets to pick first.

804
00:48:14,880 --> 00:48:16,255
Speaker 0: So he picks green, green.

805
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:22,920
Speaker 0: That means he can either be the green humans, which are the same as all the other humans, or he could be the planta, which are the plant like creatures.

806
00:48:23,482 --> 00:48:24,978
Speaker 0: Now someone else goes, they pick red.

807
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:31,371
Speaker 0: They can be the red humans, the same as all the other humans, or they can be whatever the red guys are, but they can't be the planta.

808
00:48:31,472 --> 00:48:35,240
Speaker 0: and the planta are different from the red guys, which are different from the black guys, you know?

809
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:37,880
Speaker 0: So it's like, uh, it's pretty cool.

810
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:46,612
Speaker 0: Like if you want to be humans, then you want to pick the color, not that you like, which is always going to be green, but that denies the aliens you hate the most from someone else.

811
00:48:47,785 --> 00:48:49,359
Speaker 0: It's a pretty clever mechanic there.

812
00:48:50,382 --> 00:48:54,400
Speaker 1: It is a way fun game and I highly recommend if you're into- It's a hard to get game.

813
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:58,720
Speaker 0: I recommend you go somewhere and pre-order it and pay whatever money they're asking.

814
00:48:59,821 --> 00:49:07,658
Speaker 1: It's a game to get if you like long drawn out, dramatic, angry, you know, risk kind of games, but you want a real game to be there.

815
00:49:08,460 --> 00:49:12,260
Speaker 1: Like at its core, you want it to be a real challenging, interesting game.

816
00:49:12,800 --> 00:49:21,060
Speaker 0: I get the feeling it might be best to play with four player, but I've only played a six, a five, and a three, and the six and the five, more so the six, right?

817
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:28,140
Speaker 0: There was so much competition for hexes and resources that you really, you know, the hex draw mattered a lot more.

818
00:49:28,220 --> 00:49:34,559
Speaker 0: If you drew like a bunch of, you know, alien ship hexes, you needed to spend some early actions upgrading your ships.

819
00:49:34,861 --> 00:49:48,827
Speaker 0: Whereas someone else who drew a bunch of easy hexes that had a lot of spots to put cubes got basically easy free expansion and they could use an action to explore a whole nother tile while you had to use two actions to buy some ships and upgrade them or research technology.

820
00:49:50,382 --> 00:49:54,519
Speaker 0: And as a result, you got less cubes on the board, which slowed you down for the rest of the game and is annoying.

821
00:49:55,581 --> 00:49:59,560
Speaker 0: In five player, it was sort of the same as six, but a little less so, less annoying.

822
00:49:59,961 --> 00:50:01,760
Speaker 0: In three, it was almost too easy.

823
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:08,460
Speaker 0: We didn't even explore all the hexes because, which might've been some strategic mistakes because it's only the third time we played, right?

824
00:50:08,587 --> 00:50:08,720
Speaker 1: Yeah.

825
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:14,379
Speaker 1: The one game I played in, part of the reason I won is early on, I went way off into interstellar space and got a bunch of victory points.

826
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:19,920
Speaker 1: And one person next to me was walled off away from me by alien ships.

827
00:50:20,342 --> 00:50:23,900
Speaker 1: And the other person, we shared diplomats right away.

828
00:50:25,130 --> 00:50:26,360
Speaker 1: You want to talk about the trader card?

829
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:29,720
Speaker 0: I want to finish talking about the, uh, the explorey random bit, right?

830
00:50:29,860 --> 00:50:33,854
Speaker 0: Is I feel like four players would be the best combination of?

831
00:50:34,396 --> 00:50:36,820
Speaker 0: you're actually competing for the resources, right?

832
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,920
Speaker 0: Cause in three, you're not really competing so much.

833
00:50:39,080 --> 00:50:42,200
Speaker 0: Like we didn't fight till the last turn and then we didn't fight, you know?

834
00:50:42,922 --> 00:50:45,440
Speaker 0: But in five, it was almost too tight.

835
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:50,340
Speaker 0: It's like, I like tight competition, but it's almost too tight to where the randomness means more than the competition.

836
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:54,900
Speaker 0: I think four, I want to play a four player game because it would only take two hours with people who knew how to play.

837
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:02,640
Speaker 0: And I think the competition for resources would be, you know, the right tightness and they would be, the randomness would matter the right amount.

838
00:51:03,582 --> 00:51:04,760
Speaker 0: And it seems like the internet agrees.

839
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,158
Speaker 0: They're like four players is besto.

840
00:51:07,521 --> 00:51:11,060
Speaker 1: Well, it says best with four or six players.

841
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:15,219
Speaker 0: But it plays two to six and I'm curious to play the two as well, but I think it might be boring and weird.

842
00:51:15,520 --> 00:51:15,611
Speaker 0: Yeah.

843
00:51:15,901 --> 00:51:17,639
Speaker 1: I don't know if they're weird, but I do want to try it.

844
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:19,159
Speaker 0: There is a one rule change.

845
00:51:19,521 --> 00:51:22,080
Speaker 0: I'm not sure how much of a rule change it is, but we got to try it at least once.

846
00:51:22,401 --> 00:51:26,080
Speaker 1: There's an official eclipse fact for errata and problems.

847
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:27,014
Speaker 0: I'll check that out.

848
00:51:27,782 --> 00:51:29,440
Speaker 0: So talk about the trader mechanism.

849
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:34,860
Speaker 1: So if you want to make an alliance with someone, you can do it.

850
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:39,812
Speaker 1: If you share borders, you give them a diplomat and a cube and they give you a diplomat and a cube.

851
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:43,240
Speaker 0: So it lets you basically increase one of your things by one.

852
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,520
Speaker 0: You can increase your money, science or materials by one cube.

853
00:51:46,824 --> 00:51:47,720
Speaker 0: That's a pretty good benefit.

854
00:51:47,942 --> 00:51:49,640
Speaker 0: And you give each other a victory point.

855
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,280
Speaker 0: So it's basically king making.

856
00:51:51,401 --> 00:51:56,458
Speaker 0: It's like we'll both go up and get one victory point each and we'll get ahead of all these other players by one point.

857
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:07,279
Speaker 0: So if you betray that alliance by attacking a person you have an alliance with, which means even putting ships in their hexes, you can't even fly through their space at all.

858
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:12,998
Speaker 1: You take the you re exchange the diplomats to take your cube back, put it back on your stupid sheet.

859
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:17,498
Speaker 0: You both give each other the victory points back and you get the trader card.

860
00:52:17,558 --> 00:52:20,020
Speaker 1: that's worth minus two victory points at the end of the game.

861
00:52:20,162 --> 00:52:21,819
Speaker 1: And you cannot make any new alliances.

862
00:52:23,204 --> 00:52:24,420
Speaker 0: As long as you're holding the trader card.

863
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:26,180
Speaker 1: There's only one trader card.

864
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,960
Speaker 1: Only the last trader is punished like this.

865
00:52:29,140 --> 00:52:31,900
Speaker 0: So if someone else is a trader, they take the trader card from you.

866
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:40,539
Speaker 0: Now you can make alliances again and you don't get minus two victory points at the end of the game, which means there's this huge incentive to basically never trader someone.

867
00:52:40,579 --> 00:52:42,539
Speaker 0: because if you trader someone, you're going to get the trader card.

868
00:52:42,921 --> 00:52:53,532
Speaker 0: And as soon as you get it, unless the only reason to do it would be if you were going to gain more than two victory points by killing that other guy, in which case, good, good job.

869
00:52:53,920 --> 00:52:59,596
Speaker 0: But nobody, once you trader, no one else is going to try to take the trader card from you.

870
00:52:59,640 --> 00:53:02,800
Speaker 0: Because let's say I attack one of your guys on the second last turn.

871
00:53:03,305 --> 00:53:04,179
Speaker 0: It's a four point hex.

872
00:53:04,826 --> 00:53:05,719
Speaker 0: I take the negative two.

873
00:53:05,981 --> 00:53:07,100
Speaker 0: It's a plus two positive.

874
00:53:07,482 --> 00:53:12,840
Speaker 0: And I have the nukes and on the last turn, I'm going to be able to just roll you over and get like a bunch more points, right?

875
00:53:13,621 --> 00:53:18,358
Speaker 0: No one else is going to want a trader now because that'll basically be giving me two victory points.

876
00:53:19,620 --> 00:53:28,460
Speaker 0: And it's like so basically the first trader is going to be the only trader unless they're going to get so many more victory points that it's worth it for them to take it.

877
00:53:28,901 --> 00:53:33,539
Speaker 0: It's in, you know, but even if they do take it now, suddenly you can make alliances again and get even more points.

878
00:53:34,060 --> 00:53:53,060
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, in other games that just have alliances and not alliances, you whether the alliances are enforced by the rules or whether they just agree to be friends like in risk, you actually have a real reason not to trade or someone in this game.

879
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:53,978
Speaker 0: And it kind of works.

880
00:53:54,260 --> 00:53:56,139
Speaker 0: Rim was usually a dick and just traders everyone.

881
00:53:57,180 --> 00:53:58,615
Speaker 1: Granted, I only had one trader card.

882
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:06,600
Speaker 1: And as a result, my plan was make an alliance with that person and then leave my rear undefended and explore interstellar space.

883
00:54:06,704 --> 00:54:07,140
Speaker 1: And you know what?

884
00:54:07,302 --> 00:54:08,400
Speaker 1: I won that fucking game.

885
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:14,280
Speaker 0: I realize, though, if I'm playing someone in the future, because, you know, it's like, I think it's going to take a lot of plays to learn the best moves.

886
00:54:14,940 --> 00:54:18,740
Speaker 0: If anyone leaves their rear undefended to me, I'm going to upgrade my drives.

887
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:24,100
Speaker 0: No one in any of the games I've played put a lot of effort into upgrading drives to make their ships move more open in my game.

888
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:27,600
Speaker 1: In fact, I had a gigantic army that could move one hex per turn.

889
00:54:27,882 --> 00:54:28,120
Speaker 0: Exactly.

890
00:54:28,541 --> 00:54:33,759
Speaker 0: If someone leaves anything undefended, even if they're my ally, I'm going to get the four hex drives and the nukes.

891
00:54:34,041 --> 00:54:41,680
Speaker 0: And then in one turn, all my interceptors will fly through all your empty space where there's nothing but cubes and there's no ships defending it and just kill all your.

892
00:54:41,962 --> 00:54:44,960
Speaker 0: and I don't give a shit if I get two traitor victory points.

893
00:54:45,300 --> 00:54:48,120
Speaker 0: If I take away four or five hexes from you, you are fucked.

894
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:49,280
Speaker 0: All right.

895
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,259
Speaker 0: So that's what I'm going to do.

896
00:54:51,626 --> 00:54:51,938
Speaker 0: All right.

897
00:54:52,421 --> 00:54:55,420
Speaker 1: So I didn't want to bring this up in the meta moment because I think we're done.

898
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:56,560
Speaker 1: This is the salvage moment.

899
00:54:57,361 --> 00:55:01,100
Speaker 1: I, as in, you know, my company, I'm looking for a good Linux system administrator.

900
00:55:02,024 --> 00:55:03,280
Speaker 0: Hey, got to pay for that advertising.

901
00:55:03,620 --> 00:55:10,767
Speaker 1: So if anybody is no advertising, a good Linux system administrator, I'm getting paid for I.T.

902
00:55:10,787 --> 00:55:12,400
Speaker 1: I'd like you to know Windows.

903
00:55:12,580 --> 00:55:14,399
Speaker 0: You got to pay double because there's no advertising show.

904
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,819
Speaker 1: I don't need any, you know, financial services software.

905
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:21,654
Speaker 1: I just need someone who knows networking and system admin, I.T.

906
00:55:21,695 --> 00:55:22,640
Speaker 1: majors in particular.

907
00:55:23,220 --> 00:55:24,006
Speaker 1: All you are I.T.

908
00:55:24,046 --> 00:55:25,860
Speaker 1: kids I know who might be graduating soon.

909
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,280
Speaker 0: I'm looking at you to a million dollars is what it costs to advertise the show.

910
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:30,337
Speaker 1: So let me know.

911
00:55:30,620 --> 00:55:33,479
Speaker 0: I'll set up for one hundred K and you would be working for me.

912
00:55:33,821 --> 00:55:36,280
Speaker 1: I mean, you might enjoy that because we can be bought.

913
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,000
Speaker 0: But I've been told that I'm pretty cool.

914
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:39,940
Speaker 0: I promise not to advertise in the show ever again.

915
00:55:39,940 --> 00:55:41,900
Speaker 1: I paid myself a million dollars for this ad.

916
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:42,858
Speaker 0: No, you got to pay me.

917
00:55:43,221 --> 00:55:43,820
Speaker 1: I paid myself.

918
00:55:43,921 --> 00:55:44,677
Speaker 0: It's also my show.

919
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,360
