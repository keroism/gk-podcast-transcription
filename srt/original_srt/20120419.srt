1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:14,094
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, April 19th, 2012.

2
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:14,661
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:14,924 --> 00:00:15,430
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:17,358
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:17,398 --> 00:00:19,869
Speaker 1: Tonight, The Hunger Games.

6
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:22,584
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,734 --> 00:00:27,489
Speaker 1: The hunger.

8
00:00:28,874 --> 00:00:31,030
Speaker 1: I wish I had not remembered that that existed.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:35,610
Speaker 0: I wish you also had not remembered that or reminded me of it, forcing me to remember it.

10
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,050
Speaker 1: Yup, it's quite a thing, that hunger.

11
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:40,090
Speaker 0: I hunger.

12
00:00:41,633 --> 00:00:42,018
Speaker 1: I also live.

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,482
Speaker 1: You just ate a whole ton of my cheese.

14
00:00:44,502 --> 00:00:45,430
Speaker 1: You should be good for a while.

15
00:00:45,511 --> 00:00:46,250
Speaker 0: I'm still hungry.

16
00:00:46,411 --> 00:00:46,790
Speaker 1: Still hungry?

17
00:00:47,096 --> 00:00:47,181
Speaker 1: Yes.

18
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,970
Speaker 1: Luckily, The Hunger Games describes food in excruciating detail at all times.

19
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:56,950
Speaker 0: Let us save that for the part where we're going to talk about that.

20
00:00:57,790 --> 00:00:59,761
Speaker 1: Alright, so it's Thursday.

21
00:00:59,942 --> 00:01:01,370
Speaker 1: So it's the lounge, technically.

22
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:01,893
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

23
00:01:01,933 --> 00:01:02,637
Speaker 0: It's the book club.

24
00:01:02,697 --> 00:01:03,361
Speaker 0: It's a different show.

25
00:01:03,381 --> 00:01:04,387
Speaker 0: It's not even a Thursday show.

26
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:04,830
Speaker 0: It's a book club.

27
00:01:04,849 --> 00:01:06,442
Speaker 1: Oh, so I guess I shouldn't have said it's Geek Nights.

28
00:01:06,462 --> 00:01:07,430
Speaker 1: It's the Geek Nights book club.

29
00:01:08,275 --> 00:01:08,749
Speaker 0: You should have.

30
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,349
Speaker 1: So, I got a question for you, Scott.

31
00:01:11,432 --> 00:01:14,589
Speaker 1: If I put this episode up as book club, where will it show up?

32
00:01:15,695 --> 00:01:16,029
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

33
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,618
Speaker 1: As opposed to Thursday.

34
00:01:17,638 --> 00:01:19,509
Speaker 1: Because it doesn't show up on the front page of Geek Nights.

35
00:01:19,891 --> 00:01:20,456
Speaker 0: It does not.

36
00:01:20,537 --> 00:01:21,850
Speaker 0: It shows up in the book club section.

37
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:23,749
Speaker 1: Does anyone out there know where that is?

38
00:01:24,491 --> 00:01:25,679
Speaker 0: No one goes to the website anyway.

39
00:01:25,699 --> 00:01:27,370
Speaker 0: They just go to the RSS feed where it will appear.

40
00:01:28,471 --> 00:01:31,988
Speaker 0: But, you will only see it in the Thursday RSS feed.

41
00:01:32,008 --> 00:01:32,490
Speaker 0: You won't see it.

42
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:36,530
Speaker 0: You'll only see it in the total RSS feed or the book club RSS feed.

43
00:01:37,591 --> 00:01:40,126
Speaker 0: Because I only half upgraded the site and I didn't 100% upgrade it.

44
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,430
Speaker 1: That's also why every episode has a link to a forum discussion that doesn't exist.

45
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:45,296
Speaker 0: That's true.

46
00:01:45,357 --> 00:01:46,208
Speaker 0: I'm going to fix all that.

47
00:01:47,096 --> 00:01:47,790
Speaker 1: Oh well, we'll get there.

48
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:48,906
Speaker 1: We'll get there.

49
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:51,309
Speaker 0: I sort of mostly fixed it.

50
00:01:51,732 --> 00:01:52,770
Speaker 0: Well, we've been busy.

51
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:56,384
Speaker 0: I got to work all day and then every, you know, it's like, "Oh, we just finished a convention.

52
00:01:56,444 --> 00:01:57,428
Speaker 0: Hey, there's another convention.

53
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:57,669
Speaker 0: Fuck.".

54
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:00,510
Speaker 1: I know, another convention that's coming up actually in a few weeks.

55
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:01,658
Speaker 0: Non-stop stuff.

56
00:02:01,699 --> 00:02:03,270
Speaker 0: So, when the fuck am I supposed to do anything?

57
00:02:03,831 --> 00:02:05,530
Speaker 1: That's the life of a D-list celebrity.

58
00:02:06,012 --> 00:02:06,609
Speaker 0: That's an F-list.

59
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,429
Speaker 1: If we're D-list.

60
00:02:07,695 --> 00:02:07,990
Speaker 1: Z-list.

61
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:10,830
Speaker 1: We're on the level of like local news guy.

62
00:02:11,212 --> 00:02:11,730
Speaker 0: No, we're not.

63
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,829
Speaker 1: Who's not the prime time news guy.

64
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:15,769
Speaker 0: We're on the level of...

65
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,350
Speaker 1: We're like the local backup news guy.

66
00:02:17,490 --> 00:02:17,751
Speaker 0: That's right.

67
00:02:17,811 --> 00:02:19,055
Speaker 0: Backup news guy, right?

68
00:02:19,096 --> 00:02:23,230
Speaker 0: Like the guy who does the weather when the weather guy who usually does it is sick.

69
00:02:23,772 --> 00:02:25,745
Speaker 1: Or the guy who does the weather at like 6 a.m.

70
00:02:25,765 --> 00:02:26,450
Speaker 1: when no one's watching.

71
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,590
Speaker 0: Oh, that's true.

72
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:27,797
Speaker 0: Yeah.

73
00:02:28,171 --> 00:02:32,110
Speaker 0: Or like any of the people who do the weather on the weather channel because it keeps rotating.

74
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:35,610
Speaker 0: And no one actually knows any of those people because they're not, you know, known personalities.

75
00:02:35,832 --> 00:02:35,900
Speaker 1: Yup.

76
00:02:37,012 --> 00:02:38,570
Speaker 1: We're nowhere near Soledad O'Brien.

77
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,610
Speaker 1: Surprisingly, one of the few people like that I know exists.

78
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:42,530
Speaker 0: Don't know who that is.

79
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:42,783
Speaker 0: Really?

80
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:46,310
Speaker 1: Soledad O'Brien is the one who taught me that Cuzar existed.

81
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,069
Speaker 0: Okay.

82
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:48,164
Speaker 1: Long time ago.

83
00:02:48,225 --> 00:02:48,510
Speaker 1: Anyway.

84
00:02:49,470 --> 00:03:02,670
Speaker 1: So, you know, because it's the book club, we're not going to really do news, but I do want to talk about how... Soledad O'Brien has not yet gotten used to the fact that there is stuff to do in New York.

85
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:03,131
Speaker 0: Yeah.

86
00:03:03,192 --> 00:03:05,150
Speaker 0: You'd say we're doing stuff constantly.

87
00:03:05,390 --> 00:03:05,913
Speaker 0: He does stuff.

88
00:03:06,034 --> 00:03:08,709
Speaker 0: The thing is, he doesn't have a nine to five kind of job like we do.

89
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:08,975
Speaker 0: Yup.

90
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:09,853
Speaker 0: Necessarily.

91
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,729
Speaker 0: But he has enough monies to live.

92
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,210
Speaker 0: So, and freelancing and that kind of thing.

93
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,167
Speaker 1: So he, you know, he invites us to...

94
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:19,110
Speaker 0: He constantly does anything that there is in the city, he does it.

95
00:03:19,351 --> 00:03:19,934
Speaker 1: I'll put it this way.

96
00:03:19,974 --> 00:03:22,670
Speaker 1: My calendar is like almost completely full.

97
00:03:23,111 --> 00:03:29,790
Speaker 1: And yet somehow he is doing stuff all the times that I'm doing stuff and not doing stuff.

98
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:30,651
Speaker 0: Yeah.

99
00:03:30,671 --> 00:03:33,250
Speaker 0: So he'll invite me to like every freaking thing in the universe.

100
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,701
Speaker 0: Hey, you want to see this chiptune thing?

101
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,890
Speaker 0: Hey, you want to go see this concert?

102
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:36,801
Speaker 0: Hey, we're going to see this movie.

103
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,670
Speaker 0: Hey, we're going to see... And I'm like, one out of 20 times I'll say, okay.

104
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:43,930
Speaker 1: So I actually went to that chiptune concert and it was quite a happening.

105
00:03:44,552 --> 00:03:45,710
Speaker 1: It was not what I expected.

106
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,889
Speaker 0: Should I have gone?

107
00:03:47,452 --> 00:03:48,470
Speaker 1: I'm going to go with yes.

108
00:03:49,011 --> 00:03:49,350
Speaker 0: Okay.

109
00:03:49,592 --> 00:03:50,390
Speaker 1: I'm going to go with yes.

110
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:55,790
Speaker 1: So I went to Control Flow, which was a chiptune event.

111
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,349
Speaker 0: So that was the name of the event?

112
00:03:57,574 --> 00:03:57,746
Speaker 0: Yes.

113
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:58,769
Speaker 0: What was the name of the venue?

114
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:01,430
Speaker 1: So the venue was called Suburbia.

115
00:04:02,194 --> 00:04:02,387
Speaker 1: Okay.

116
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:05,283
Speaker 1: So I said like a month prior, like, yeah, I'll go.

117
00:04:05,324 --> 00:04:06,510
Speaker 1: That sounds fucking awesome.

118
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:14,750
Speaker 1: Chill Brave and Danimal were playing and I think a band called Knife City, which while I didn't know who they were, Knife City is a great name for a band.

119
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:17,577
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

120
00:04:17,598 --> 00:04:18,750
Speaker 1: So I said, yeah, I'll go to this thing.

121
00:04:19,051 --> 00:04:22,350
Speaker 1: It could be cool, you know, Brooklyn hipstery kind of chiptune party.

122
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:23,277
Speaker 1: I'm down with that.

123
00:04:23,297 --> 00:04:23,903
Speaker 1: I'll wear a kilt.

124
00:04:23,943 --> 00:04:24,589
Speaker 1: I'll be that guy.

125
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:26,197
Speaker 1: And I forgot about it.

126
00:04:26,278 --> 00:04:29,538
Speaker 1: So the day of it comes and I'm like, oh, yeah, I wonder where this place is.

127
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:30,930
Speaker 1: I know it's in Brooklyn somewhere.

128
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:33,809
Speaker 1: It's probably going to be a pain in the ass to get to, but I'll deal.

129
00:04:34,752 --> 00:04:36,643
Speaker 1: And I just Google like Suburbia, Brooklyn.

130
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:37,427
Speaker 1: It doesn't show up.

131
00:04:38,534 --> 00:04:38,829
Speaker 0: Okay.

132
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:47,589
Speaker 1: So I start digging around and I eventually find a forum post where I figure out what the address of Suburbia is.

133
00:04:48,612 --> 00:04:51,190
Speaker 1: It's 330 Melrose Street in Brooklyn.

134
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:57,622
Speaker 1: I think it's kind of a residential neighborhood, but it's probably some like hip new place in a basement bar or something.

135
00:04:57,642 --> 00:04:58,690
Speaker 1: So it's all cool.

136
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:02,410
Speaker 1: So I take a cab because it's Brooklyn and I'm in Queens.

137
00:05:03,212 --> 00:05:07,430
Speaker 1: And I get there and the cab lets me off and it's just apartments.

138
00:05:08,751 --> 00:05:09,354
Speaker 1: Like that's it.

139
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:12,270
Speaker 1: It's just apartments and brownstones and empty warehouses.

140
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:13,750
Speaker 0: Are you saying this is an illegal venue?

141
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:19,570
Speaker 1: I am saying that this reeks of a not entirely legitimate venue.

142
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:21,462
Speaker 0: Where did the tickets come from?

143
00:05:21,523 --> 00:05:22,090
Speaker 0: Not Ticketmaster.

144
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:28,289
Speaker 0: Were they, this is the free, you know, the thing you buy at Staples that has dropped this ticket.

145
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:35,309
Speaker 1: So the tickets were give a dude five bucks after you go into this apartment and they stamp your hand.

146
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:40,190
Speaker 0: Was it at least a stamp that was like, you know, a stamp that said Suburbia or something?

147
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,730
Speaker 0: Or was it just a stamp the guy bought at the store with an alligator on it?

148
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:47,269
Speaker 1: It was a blob that covered the entire back of my right hand.

149
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,133
Speaker 0: Okay.

150
00:05:48,497 --> 00:05:49,469
Speaker 1: But it was just a blob.

151
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:55,770
Speaker 1: So basically I'm walking down the street and it's just an empty street and there's all these just like brownstones and apartments.

152
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,710
Speaker 0: So when you went inside, were there any people in there?

153
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:01,250
Speaker 1: So I'm walking around, I'm like, did I get the address wrong?

154
00:06:01,733 --> 00:06:02,650
Speaker 1: Am I just stupid?

155
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:12,609
Speaker 1: And then I see this one apartment that has the right address and there's this tiny handwritten sign propped in the door that says Chiptune concert here.

156
00:06:13,252 --> 00:06:14,689
Speaker 1: And I pull on the door and it's locked.

157
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:15,875
Speaker 0: Okay.

158
00:06:15,895 --> 00:06:16,729
Speaker 0: Did you get there too early?

159
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:17,473
Speaker 1: No.

160
00:06:17,756 --> 00:06:18,484
Speaker 1: So I'm standing there.

161
00:06:18,504 --> 00:06:18,928
Speaker 1: I look around.

162
00:06:20,232 --> 00:06:21,868
Speaker 1: I try to yank the door open and I can't.

163
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,469
Speaker 1: There's buzzers for apartments.

164
00:06:24,570 --> 00:06:30,188
Speaker 1: Two other guys walk up and they are confused like me and they look to me as though I should know what's going on.

165
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:31,984
Speaker 1: So I'm like, Chiptunes?

166
00:06:32,004 --> 00:06:32,530
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah.

167
00:06:33,452 --> 00:06:34,669
Speaker 1: They look like Chiptunes-y dudes.

168
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:39,750
Speaker 1: And I just wing it and I hit the buzzer for the basement apartment.

169
00:06:40,611 --> 00:06:41,315
Speaker 0: You just guessed?

170
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:43,969
Speaker 0: There wasn't any indication of which one it was supposed to be?

171
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:44,472
Speaker 1: Nope.

172
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:50,810
Speaker 1: So I hit that and a couple other buttons and I start buzzing and eventually the door goes and I go in and I stand there in the landing.

173
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,308
Speaker 1: I'm like, all right, do I go up or down?

174
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:54,477
Speaker 0: So you had two guys with you.

175
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,510
Speaker 0: You could have split up three ways and figured it out.

176
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,995
Speaker 1: So they stand there confused.

177
00:06:58,076 --> 00:07:01,310
Speaker 1: I start to go up and they're like, whoa, dude, wait.

178
00:07:01,752 --> 00:07:10,570
Speaker 1: And then I stop and I turn around and behind me there's the tiniest sign that's like Sharpie and it says, do not go upstairs in all caps.

179
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:16,790
Speaker 1: So I'm like, okay, we go to the basement and yeah, give a guy five grubby bucks.

180
00:07:17,453 --> 00:07:18,643
Speaker 1: I only had like $8 on me because...

181
00:07:20,031 --> 00:07:21,300
Speaker 0: Way to not be prepared.

182
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:21,804
Speaker 0: What if it was 10?

183
00:07:21,804 --> 00:07:22,630
Speaker 0: What would you have done?

184
00:07:22,790 --> 00:07:27,988
Speaker 1: I knew it was five bucks, but I also assumed it was a real venue where I could then use a credit card at a bar.

185
00:07:29,332 --> 00:07:33,050
Speaker 1: So I go in and it's totally some dude's apartment.

186
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:33,471
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

187
00:07:33,512 --> 00:07:34,517
Speaker 0: It's some dude's apartment.

188
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,830
Speaker 0: Was there alcohol served at a bar?

189
00:07:37,131 --> 00:07:37,406
Speaker 0: Oh yes.

190
00:07:38,252 --> 00:07:39,890
Speaker 0: There was no liquor license though.

191
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:40,929
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

192
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:42,029
Speaker 0: No liquor license.

193
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:42,986
Speaker 1: There might've been.

194
00:07:43,832 --> 00:07:43,974
Speaker 0: What?

195
00:07:43,994 --> 00:07:45,670
Speaker 0: We can't get a liquor license for a basement.

196
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:46,216
Speaker 1: Here's the deal.

197
00:07:46,256 --> 00:07:47,469
Speaker 1: Here's what this venue was.

198
00:07:47,911 --> 00:07:52,710
Speaker 1: In the basement of this apartment building, there is this sort of antechamber.

199
00:07:53,711 --> 00:07:59,570
Speaker 1: And in that chamber were what looked like doors with numbers that were entrances to other apartments.

200
00:08:00,373 --> 00:08:03,230
Speaker 1: But it was also this big like bar area.

201
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:08,790
Speaker 1: There was a bar like set up and they were selling PBRs and shots of vodka.

202
00:08:09,472 --> 00:08:10,509
Speaker 1: And that was basically it.

203
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:11,588
Speaker 0: No liquor license.

204
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:12,787
Speaker 1: Probably not.

205
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:14,810
Speaker 0: You didn't see one posted, right?

206
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:17,290
Speaker 1: I had exactly $3 and it was $3.

207
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:24,790
Speaker 1: So I bought a PBR because I needed something to hold while I stood there awkwardly in this venue with the kinds of people who show up to a venue like this.

208
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,959
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's a basement.

209
00:08:25,980 --> 00:08:27,150
Speaker 0: I would just hold my dick, right?

210
00:08:27,691 --> 00:08:29,649
Speaker 1: So, and then there's a door.

211
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:35,049
Speaker 1: And through that door is a straight up like club.

212
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:39,530
Speaker 1: Complete with flammable ass looking walls.

213
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:42,429
Speaker 1: These spotlights that look like they're going to start a fire.

214
00:08:42,809 --> 00:08:44,310
Speaker 0: But it was actually, how big was it?

215
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,013
Speaker 1: Gigantic.

216
00:08:45,033 --> 00:08:47,010
Speaker 1: There were like 200 plus people in there.

217
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:49,070
Speaker 0: So it was actually, there's a whole club in there somehow.

218
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:49,510
Speaker 0: Yeah.

219
00:08:50,692 --> 00:08:53,769
Speaker 1: This is the kind of venue where the concert's going full swing.

220
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,369
Speaker 1: I look around, I count, there are over 200 people crammed in.

221
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:04,670
Speaker 1: I look at Chase, I'm like, this is going to be on the news as a whole bunch of hipsters die in a fire when that light gets knocked over.

222
00:09:04,910 --> 00:09:05,249
Speaker 0: That's right.

223
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,410
Speaker 1: There's a projector pointed at a sheet hanging from the wall.

224
00:09:09,272 --> 00:09:14,489
Speaker 1: And there's a couple more apartments, it looks like, just attached to the venue, like in there.

225
00:09:15,915 --> 00:09:16,689
Speaker 0: How awesome would that be?

226
00:09:16,811 --> 00:09:18,449
Speaker 0: You walk out of your apartment and you're in a club.

227
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:28,390
Speaker 1: My best guess is that a whole bunch of dudes that were chill with this and chill with each other got apartments like all together in the basement of this building and just made a venue in the common space.

228
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:29,229
Speaker 1: That was gigantic.

229
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:31,930
Speaker 0: And the people upstairs don't mind as long as you don't go up there.

230
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,110
Speaker 1: I guess, or they live there.

231
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:39,529
Speaker 1: Now, I knew it was shady when I walk out to get some air because I couldn't breathe down there by the end of this.

232
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:40,070
Speaker 0: No kidding.

233
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:43,110
Speaker 1: So I go up after like three of the bands play.

234
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:48,449
Speaker 1: And I walk outside and we're all kind of chilling outside like really quietly, just getting some air.

235
00:09:48,892 --> 00:09:53,083
Speaker 1: And the guy who, I guess, owns the place keeps coming out saying, "You can't hang out in front of the building.

236
00:09:53,103 --> 00:09:54,010
Speaker 1: You got to walk down the street.

237
00:09:54,090 --> 00:09:54,920
Speaker 1: Don't stand in front of the

238
00:09:54,941 --> 00:09:55,244
Speaker 1: building.".

239
00:09:55,917 --> 00:09:56,205
Speaker 0: Yeah.

240
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,728
Speaker 0: Smart guy.

241
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,202
Speaker 0: Yep.

242
00:09:58,392 --> 00:09:59,088
Speaker 0: Smart guy.

243
00:10:00,054 --> 00:10:01,030
Speaker 1: And it was pretty rocking.

244
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,090
Speaker 1: I mean, if you like chiptunes, it was a pretty happening, dancing thing.

245
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:08,550
Speaker 1: There was some crazy moshing, some crazy stage diving.

246
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,410
Speaker 1: Well, crowd surfing.

247
00:10:11,031 --> 00:10:17,850
Speaker 0: We should wait for them to host something shitty there that we don't like and then call the cops, like 311, just to see what happens.

248
00:10:19,093 --> 00:10:21,090
Speaker 1: I imagine Benny Hill music starts playing right about then.

249
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:22,889
Speaker 0: And then video it for YouTube.

250
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:26,510
Speaker 0: And then we could video all the hipsters like pouring out like a spigot.

251
00:10:27,554 --> 00:10:28,810
Speaker 1: But I had one of those moments.

252
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,090
Speaker 0: And then we could put Benny Hill on top of it on our YouTube vid.

253
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:37,770
Speaker 1: So I'm standing there talking to this girl who has like 8-bit style wings tattooed on her back.

254
00:10:38,094 --> 00:10:38,409
Speaker 1: Okay.

255
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:40,168
Speaker 1: And she's drinking a PBR.

256
00:10:40,811 --> 00:10:43,409
Speaker 1: We're talking about chiptunes and packs because I'm wearing my pack shirt.

257
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:48,189
Speaker 1: And I was wearing a kilt and I was drinking a PBR.

258
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:53,330
Speaker 1: And I realized that I was, in fact, not ironically one of those people that the rest of the world makes fun of as hipsters.

259
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:54,410
Speaker 0: That's right.

260
00:10:55,672 --> 00:10:59,050
Speaker 1: And it was pretty awesome, actually, considering the fact that I could have died.

261
00:10:59,952 --> 00:11:02,570
Speaker 1: The only problem really was that the stench of B.O.

262
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:06,450
Speaker 0: You're more afraid of dying down there than you are like skiing, which is much more dangerous.

263
00:11:06,550 --> 00:11:06,792
Speaker 0: Yeah.

264
00:11:06,974 --> 00:11:08,409
Speaker 1: I was more afraid of dying down there.

265
00:11:08,711 --> 00:11:12,510
Speaker 1: Because at one point the stage dive or the crowd surfers kicked the lights.

266
00:11:13,494 --> 00:11:14,669
Speaker 1: I was worried that shit was going to fall.

267
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:21,230
Speaker 1: But so at one point I suddenly smell weed, which at a concert you expect.

268
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:24,230
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I assumed it already smelled like weed the whole time.

269
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:24,984
Speaker 0: It didn't until-.

270
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:28,770
Speaker 0: The fact that it only smelled like weed once and later on is surprising.

271
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:32,248
Speaker 1: No, what was surprising, and again, I turn and we all look at each other like,

272
00:11:32,268 --> 00:11:32,529
Speaker 1: "Really?"

273
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:36,530
Speaker 1: Is that it didn't smell like that skunky kind of like awful weed that you smell at metal shows.

274
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:37,830
Speaker 0: Someone has some high quality weed.

275
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:38,910
Speaker 1: It smelled high quality.

276
00:11:39,212 --> 00:11:39,256
Speaker 0: Ah.

277
00:11:39,671 --> 00:11:44,249
Speaker 1: So it's alternating waves of weed smell and B.O.

278
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:45,190
Speaker 0: All right.

279
00:11:45,554 --> 00:11:47,210
Speaker 0: And- No alcohol smell though.

280
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:47,391
Speaker 0: No.

281
00:11:47,754 --> 00:11:49,589
Speaker 1: So I turn around at one point.

282
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:53,050
Speaker 1: Because usually when you smell weed at a venue you don't see it, you just smell it.

283
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,510
Speaker 1: It's like there's mist just there somewhere.

284
00:11:55,110 --> 00:12:00,030
Speaker 1: No, there's just like this ring of people passing it around like totally openly.

285
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's okay.

286
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:01,952
Speaker 1: Yeah.

287
00:12:02,455 --> 00:12:03,724
Speaker 1: It was fun.

288
00:12:03,785 --> 00:12:04,510
Speaker 1: It was an experience.

289
00:12:05,572 --> 00:12:07,284
Speaker 1: I would go back to an event at this venue.

290
00:12:08,652 --> 00:12:09,080
Speaker 0: Okay.

291
00:12:09,141 --> 00:12:09,549
Speaker 0: It's all you.

292
00:12:10,055 --> 00:12:10,910
Speaker 1: It was five bucks.

293
00:12:11,834 --> 00:12:12,649
Speaker 0: It's about what it's worth.

294
00:12:13,711 --> 00:12:14,195
Speaker 1: It was fun.

295
00:12:14,236 --> 00:12:15,769
Speaker 1: You should have gone just to experience it.

296
00:12:16,314 --> 00:12:17,049
Speaker 0: I have better things to do.

297
00:12:17,251 --> 00:12:18,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think you would have had fun.

298
00:12:18,533 --> 00:12:19,227
Speaker 0: I have better things to do.

299
00:12:19,531 --> 00:12:20,910
Speaker 1: You could have listened to Knife City.

300
00:12:21,395 --> 00:12:22,450
Speaker 0: How good were the chip tunes?

301
00:12:23,372 --> 00:12:26,090
Speaker 1: It was the kind of chip tunes you get at Magfest.

302
00:12:26,310 --> 00:12:30,950
Speaker 1: You know, a bunch of guys sort of ad-libbing on retro synth kind of music.

303
00:12:31,535 --> 00:12:31,746
Speaker 1: All right.

304
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:40,549
Speaker 1: Very ambient and very ... I can't ... I don't understand people who listen to music like that on its own more than once.

305
00:12:41,371 --> 00:12:46,524
Speaker 1: This is the kind of music that you have to listen to live at a venue or it really doesn't do anything, at least for me.

306
00:12:48,835 --> 00:12:49,543
Speaker 1: It was an experience.

307
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,169
Speaker 1: I thought I'd share.

308
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:51,051
Speaker 0: Okay.

309
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,009
Speaker 0: Do you want to do things of the day?

310
00:12:59,855 --> 00:13:00,727
Speaker 1: I guess I do.

311
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,610
Speaker 1: So the Hunger Games ...

312
00:13:03,610 --> 00:13:04,470
Speaker 0: You didn't even say things of the day.

313
00:13:05,154 --> 00:13:05,908
Speaker 1: Because you said it.

314
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:06,384
Speaker 0: Okay.

315
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:09,309
Speaker 1: The Hunger Games is one thing.

316
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,499
Speaker 0: This isn't a thing of the day yet.

317
00:13:10,519 --> 00:13:11,749
Speaker 0: You're skipping ahead again.

318
00:13:12,234 --> 00:13:15,590
Speaker 1: So the hunger ... Oh, God.

319
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:24,329
Speaker 1: If your regular expression ... ... of looking for the Hunger Games is the hunger.star, you're going to find something called the hunger.

320
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:26,009
Speaker 1: We've talked about this before.

321
00:13:26,630 --> 00:13:28,650
Speaker 0: This is already a thing of the day a long time ago.

322
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:36,327
Speaker 1: Yes, but I bring it back because in case ... lest you forgot, lest you forgot, I just want to say one thing.

323
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:36,990
Speaker 0: You should remain forgot.

324
00:13:37,431 --> 00:13:38,950
Speaker 1: I will say one thing and I will let this be.

325
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:41,250
Speaker 0: Remain forgot for your own goodness.

326
00:13:41,350 --> 00:13:47,790
Speaker 1: And I will go to my real thing of the day, but this thing is not ironic, not a joke.

327
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:56,190
Speaker 1: The individual responsible for making it was totally super serial in the making of it.

328
00:13:56,953 --> 00:13:57,747
Speaker 1: I will just say that.

329
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,305
Speaker 1: It is what it is.

330
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,763
Speaker 1: I will let it be what it is.

331
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:09,929
Speaker 1: So my real thing of the day is the German Sailor Moon thing is badass and some cool individual decided to sing.

332
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:10,868
Speaker 0: I was the one who found this.

333
00:14:11,037 --> 00:14:11,210
Speaker 0: Yeah.

334
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,530
Speaker 1: To sing that song translated back into English.

335
00:14:14,810 --> 00:14:22,010
Speaker 1: This is a fan translation of the German re-rendition of the Japanese Sailor Moon theme.

336
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:23,228
Speaker 1: It's pretty great.

337
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:24,449
Speaker 0: It is pretty great.

338
00:14:25,112 --> 00:14:25,529
Speaker 0: Check this out.

339
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:29,428
Speaker 0: This is old and anyone who actually knows about this is like, "Oh man, this is so

340
00:14:29,609 --> 00:14:29,749
Speaker 0: old.".

341
00:14:29,910 --> 00:14:30,310
Speaker 0: But you know what?

342
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:33,289
Speaker 0: It's also so great and 90% of people don't know it.

343
00:14:33,950 --> 00:14:38,790
Speaker 0: It got passed around the internet and I noticed it even though I didn't know about it before.

344
00:14:38,850 --> 00:14:42,670
Speaker 0: So what this is, is the conclusion of a MotoGP race.

345
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:46,450
Speaker 0: If you don't know, MotoGP is basically F1 of motorcycles, right?

346
00:14:46,971 --> 00:14:49,930
Speaker 1: The ones that lean like 89 degrees out of the corner.

347
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:51,030
Speaker 0: Exactly, right?

348
00:14:51,451 --> 00:14:53,150
Speaker 0: It's, you know, supercar, whatever it is, right?

349
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:58,330
Speaker 0: So this is the race in Catalunya from 2009, the conclusion of that race.

350
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:12,950
Speaker 0: And basically what the situation is, Valentino Rossi, who's probably the best MotoGP person there ever was, and Jorge Lorenzo, his rival, have pretty much separated from everyone else and in so close to the end of the race, one of them is going to win.

351
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:18,112
Speaker 0: So it's just the two of them right next to each other and there's like a handful of laps left.

352
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:22,730
Speaker 0: and oh man, shit gets off the hook in this video.

353
00:15:23,691 --> 00:15:25,689
Speaker 0: Someone posted it on YouTube and it got taken down.

354
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:33,269
Speaker 0: Someone else posted it and you can still watch it, but this has the Italian commentators, which is actually kind of better, I say.

355
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:39,830
Speaker 0: So yeah, you should, this is, you don't even need to understand anything about MotoGP.

356
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:43,810
Speaker 0: All you need to know is that it's a race and the guy in front win is the winner.

357
00:15:45,852 --> 00:15:54,950
Speaker 0: And I think Rossi is the guy who is more yellowish in his color and the other guys Lorenzo and their race is almost over and it's awesome.

358
00:15:55,171 --> 00:16:00,130
Speaker 1: When the race is over, time to discover dreams and places.

359
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,162
Speaker 1: So the Hunger Games.

360
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:14,050
Speaker 0: Oh shit, so first I want to make, before we talk about the specifics of this book, I want to talk about some general associated things.

361
00:16:14,531 --> 00:16:15,027
Speaker 1: Alright, alright.

362
00:16:16,171 --> 00:16:20,530
Speaker 0: So specifically, some guy wrote an article, I forget what newspaper it was, it doesn't matter anymore.

363
00:16:21,472 --> 00:16:36,742
Speaker 0: And he was like, he was basically all angry that, he basically said that he cries inside whenever he sees like a grown man reading Hunger Games or Twilight or Harry Potter or anything like that because he's like, "Those are kids books.

364
00:16:37,144 --> 00:16:38,208
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be reading adult

365
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:38,490
Speaker 0: books.".

366
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:39,452
Speaker 0: Right?

367
00:16:40,317 --> 00:16:42,430
Speaker 0: And I want to say, that's bullshit.

368
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,053
Speaker 0: A lot of, you know, just because-.

369
00:16:50,813 --> 00:16:52,330
Speaker 1: Well here are two easy counter examples.

370
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:53,670
Speaker 1: I'd be reading I Want My Hat Back.

371
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:56,109
Speaker 1: I was going to say I Want My Hat Back and The Little Prince.

372
00:16:56,612 --> 00:16:57,028
Speaker 0: Of course.

373
00:16:58,110 --> 00:17:05,109
Speaker 0: But, at the same time, I agree with him slightly in a way, in a different way.

374
00:17:05,609 --> 00:17:19,750
Speaker 0: And that is, right, obviously, it's obvious that any book that is targeted at a lower level of reading ability is going to be more popular because there is a larger potential audience of readers, right?

375
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:24,349
Speaker 0: If you write I Want My Hat Back, well anyone who's even barely literate can read that.

376
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:34,050
Speaker 0: So the potential number of people who could read that book is much, much bigger than, you know, how many people are capable of reading, I don't know, what's really hard to read?

377
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:36,229
Speaker 0: Dostoevsky or something, right?

378
00:17:36,510 --> 00:17:37,110
Speaker 1: Crime and punishment?

379
00:17:37,430 --> 00:17:42,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, so a much smaller number of people are capable of reading that book and understanding it.

380
00:17:42,851 --> 00:17:46,729
Speaker 0: And, right, so therefore that book is going to be less popular no matter what.

381
00:17:48,631 --> 00:18:03,584
Speaker 0: But, obviously I have no evidence, but I have a feeling, right, and I, you know, you can just look around you and sort of, you know, sort of agree with it, looking at what people read on the subway, that we're getting dumber because, you know, old people-

382
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,828
Speaker 1: Uh, Scott, I just point out that pulp novels were the majority reading book forever.

383
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,150
Speaker 0: It's true.

384
00:18:12,550 --> 00:18:17,530
Speaker 1: I mean, look at the drivel that people read a hundred years ago and two hundred years ago.

385
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:25,450
Speaker 0: That's true, but some of that drivel that was drivel in its day is now no longer considered drivel, right?

386
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:29,810
Speaker 0: So, a hundred years from now, Hunger Games won't be like a young adult novel.

387
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:34,190
Speaker 0: That'll be like, hi, like, you know, we'll look at that the way you looked at War and Peace.

388
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:34,911
Speaker 1: Well, maybe.

389
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:39,670
Speaker 1: I mean, Dumas stuff was, you know, drivel for its time, pulp nonsense.

390
00:18:39,690 --> 00:18:40,329
Speaker 1: Oh, it was super drivel.

391
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:42,610
Speaker 1: But, nowadays, he's considered a classic.

392
00:18:43,030 --> 00:18:43,144
Speaker 0: It is.

393
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:49,730
Speaker 1: How many other authors were published in the same anthologies and newspapers that no one remembers?

394
00:18:49,832 --> 00:18:50,990
Speaker 1: That no one considered about, right.

395
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, the best of those survived.

396
00:18:53,270 --> 00:18:55,901
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, I kind of wish, you know, it seems.

397
00:18:55,981 --> 00:19:04,870
Speaker 0: lately there has been a long spurt of very popular novels that are mostly of the young adult, lower reading level variety.

398
00:19:04,930 --> 00:19:11,110
Speaker 0: I would like to see something become as popular as Hunger Games, Harry Potter, et cetera, Twilight.

399
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:17,910
Speaker 0: That is a difficult adult book, like at least as difficult as Prince of Nothing.

400
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:23,830
Speaker 1: I don't think it's possible because of just the intelligence and commitment spectrum of humans.

401
00:19:24,370 --> 00:19:26,810
Speaker 0: I mean, Game of Thrones is a little more intelligent than this.

402
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:28,210
Speaker 1: Have you read any of it?

403
00:19:28,330 --> 00:19:32,050
Speaker 0: No, but I'm assuming, I mean, it is less of a kid's book.

404
00:19:32,110 --> 00:19:33,030
Speaker 1: No, Scott, I'll put it this way.

405
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,450
Speaker 1: It is more complicated, but the way it is written...

406
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:40,090
Speaker 0: It's about the difficulty of reading it and the level of the vocabulary used.

407
00:19:40,550 --> 00:19:43,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think it's substantially more difficult.

408
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:46,470
Speaker 0: And the complexity of the sentence structures and those sorts of things.

409
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:48,429
Speaker 1: Sentence structures do not impress me.

410
00:19:48,631 --> 00:19:49,729
Speaker 0: I'm not saying they impress me.

411
00:19:49,770 --> 00:19:54,130
Speaker 0: I'm saying it makes it more difficult to read as in a less literate person cannot...

412
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,530
Speaker 1: But Scott, Scott, is it just a matter of more difficult to read?

413
00:19:56,610 --> 00:19:58,290
Speaker 1: For example, look at Hemingway.

414
00:19:58,691 --> 00:20:00,370
Speaker 1: Those are very simple sentences.

415
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:01,268
Speaker 0: They are indeed.

416
00:20:01,411 --> 00:20:03,349
Speaker 1: And yet those are brilliant books.

417
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:04,190
Speaker 0: They are indeed.

418
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:04,790
Speaker 1: In my estimation.

419
00:20:05,033 --> 00:20:05,369
Speaker 1: Some of them.

420
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:06,150
Speaker 1: Fuck you if you disagree with me.

421
00:20:06,191 --> 00:20:06,525
Speaker 0: Some of them.

422
00:20:07,376 --> 00:20:07,869
Speaker 1: Which one isn't?

423
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:09,739
Speaker 0: I don't know.

424
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:18,450
Speaker 0: There's just a lot, so I'm not going to... I've only read like three Hemingways, so I'm not going to go out and be like... Say that all of them are great.

425
00:20:18,590 --> 00:20:27,250
Speaker 1: I'm pointing it out because the thing I've run into often, this is totally an aside before we get into the book, is people, like when the God Delusion was making the rounds, right?

426
00:20:27,636 --> 00:20:27,827
Speaker 1: Yeah.

427
00:20:28,051 --> 00:20:36,270
Speaker 1: I would come up in conversation and most kind of normal, don't really think about that sort of thing, people I would talk to would say, "Yeah, I thought it was a great book.

428
00:20:36,953 --> 00:20:38,808
Speaker 1: I agree with most of it, but I don't agree with everything you

429
00:20:38,849 --> 00:20:39,010
Speaker 1: said.".

430
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:42,049
Speaker 1: But then I would ask them, "What's one thing you disagreed

431
00:20:42,089 --> 00:20:42,210
Speaker 1: with?".

432
00:20:42,250 --> 00:20:49,570
Speaker 1: And they couldn't answer because they either hadn't actually read the book or they didn't read it thoroughly and didn't want to commit to an opinion.

433
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,770
Speaker 0: I'm just not committing because I've read three Hemingways.

434
00:20:54,970 --> 00:20:55,709
Speaker 0: They were all fine.

435
00:20:56,212 --> 00:21:00,350
Speaker 0: But I'm not going to go out and say that all of them are great when I haven't read them all.

436
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:03,070
Speaker 1: Nah, I've read a good portion of Hemingway.

437
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,789
Speaker 1: But anyway, this is neither here nor there.

438
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:09,550
Speaker 1: So in terms of The Hunger Games, the reason I chose this book was very simple.

439
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:10,727
Speaker 0: It's way popular.

440
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:18,485
Speaker 1: Before, we actually, it was on the horizon for us way before the movie was announced and it really caught fire.

441
00:21:18,832 --> 00:21:19,208
Speaker 0: Not for me.

442
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,809
Speaker 0: I didn't even really pay attention to it.

443
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:23,190
Speaker 1: Because you don't pay attention to half our forum and the things our friends say.

444
00:21:23,210 --> 00:21:24,110
Speaker 0: I knew there was a thing.

445
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:27,250
Speaker 0: I sort of got whispers that there's a popular thing called The Hunger Games.

446
00:21:27,410 --> 00:21:27,830
Speaker 0: It's something.

447
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:32,309
Speaker 0: And then I got some other whispers like, "Oh, it was a book and there's a movie in theaters

448
00:21:32,369 --> 00:21:32,510
Speaker 0: now.".

449
00:21:32,550 --> 00:21:33,123
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Oh,

450
00:21:33,143 --> 00:21:33,410
Speaker 0: okay.".

451
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:41,668
Speaker 0: And then I got another whisper through the internet that, "Oh, it's about sort of the same thing-ish Battle Royale is about with kids killing each other in some sort of deathmatch

452
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:41,849
Speaker 0: thing.".

453
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,549
Speaker 1: Yep, so this is why I'm going to be brutally honest.

454
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:49,229
Speaker 1: A few friends and listeners independently said, "Hey, Rim, you should do The Hunger

455
00:21:49,269 --> 00:21:49,590
Speaker 1: Games.".

456
00:21:49,712 --> 00:21:50,490
Speaker 1: Or at least read it.

457
00:21:50,792 --> 00:21:51,809
Speaker 1: I thought it was pretty good.

458
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:56,370
Speaker 1: And my skepticism meter was already pretty high.

459
00:21:57,070 --> 00:22:01,627
Speaker 0: I mean, it was at the level of- I did not have a meter because it was just sort of, "Oh, there's a thing,

460
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:02,050
Speaker 0: okay.".

461
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:07,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I have a high skepticism meter of anything that's recommended to me unless it comes from very specific channels.

462
00:22:07,630 --> 00:22:14,650
Speaker 1: Like, if Emily or Alex recommend something, the skepticism is way low unless there's evidence to the contrary.

463
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,729
Speaker 1: But if some random dude is like, "Hey," skepticism starts out pretty high.

464
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:22,229
Speaker 1: But I looked into it and I was like, "What's the book

465
00:22:22,249 --> 00:22:22,410
Speaker 1: about?".

466
00:22:22,430 --> 00:22:26,729
Speaker 1: And they were like, "Oh, it's a bunch of kids who have to fight to the death, blah, blah,

467
00:22:26,749 --> 00:22:26,910
Speaker 1: blah.".

468
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:34,830
Speaker 1: And I immediately tripled my skepticism because none of those people had seen or knew anything about Battle Royale.

469
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:40,070
Speaker 0: And that short description, right, that summary really sounds like Battle Royale.

470
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:51,128
Speaker 1: So I immediately thought, "Oh, this is probably a situation of people who haven't seen X, so they find Y, which is inferior, and because they don't know about X and Y is a simulacrum of it, they think it's

471
00:22:51,148 --> 00:22:51,389
Speaker 1: great.".

472
00:22:51,691 --> 00:22:53,010
Speaker 0: And they think it's a new and original thing.

473
00:22:53,231 --> 00:22:55,210
Speaker 0: It's like it's one of those safe assumptions, right?

474
00:22:55,270 --> 00:23:03,241
Speaker 0: And we see that so often as nerds, right, where something comes out and people are crazy about it and you're like, "I've seen that before.

475
00:23:03,361 --> 00:23:03,985
Speaker 0: It was called

476
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:04,690
Speaker 0: Avalon.".

477
00:23:04,831 --> 00:23:05,825
Speaker 1: "It was called Herzog

478
00:23:05,845 --> 00:23:06,088
Speaker 1: Zwei.".

479
00:23:06,391 --> 00:23:07,235
Speaker 0: "I've seen that.

480
00:23:07,396 --> 00:23:08,360
Speaker 0: It was called 1984.

481
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:09,646
Speaker 0: I've seen that.

482
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:10,309
Speaker 0: It was called...".

483
00:23:10,450 --> 00:23:13,930
Speaker 0: You know, and that happens every day in nerdery, right?

484
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:18,450
Speaker 0: So it's, you know, whether it's a correct assumption or not, it is a safe assumption.

485
00:23:19,011 --> 00:23:30,169
Speaker 0: When you hear a short description of something and it sounds like something old, nine times out of ten, it is indeed a recopying or a redoing of that old thing that you know about because you're a nerd.

486
00:23:30,991 --> 00:23:35,909
Speaker 0: And it's just those people don't know about the old thing, so they're totally fooled, and they think it's original and awesome.

487
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:43,605
Speaker 1: So I was very skeptical, almost on the level of my initial skepticism when a dude was like, "Yo, man, the new My Little Pony is really great.

488
00:23:43,645 --> 00:23:44,148
Speaker 1: You should watch

489
00:23:44,229 --> 00:23:44,269
Speaker 1: it.".

490
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:46,983
Speaker 1: I was like, "Uh, what?

491
00:23:47,606 --> 00:23:47,847
Speaker 0: Really?".

492
00:23:48,671 --> 00:23:55,270
Speaker 1: And I'd just gotten into some arguments with some friends recently about taste and quality of works and this sort of thing.

493
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,455
Speaker 1: So I was like, "You know what?

494
00:23:56,797 --> 00:23:57,099
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

495
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:58,065
Speaker 1: I'm taking that book.

496
00:23:58,226 --> 00:23:58,790
Speaker 1: I'm going to read it.

497
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:01,229
Speaker 1: It's probably going to be shit, and then I can just say I told you

498
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:01,330
Speaker 1: shit.".

499
00:24:01,371 --> 00:24:02,650
Speaker 0: Oh, you went in with a low expectation.

500
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,319
Speaker 1: I went in thinking, "You know what?

501
00:24:04,581 --> 00:24:06,009
Speaker 1: I'm going to destroy this

502
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:06,230
Speaker 1: book.".

503
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:16,650
Speaker 0: I went in with no expectation, but, and the only thing that I had in my mind that was a preconceived notion was the question of how much Battle Royale ripoff is this question mark.

504
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,890
Speaker 0: Other than that, I had no other things in my brain about it when I started reading it.

505
00:24:21,090 --> 00:24:24,250
Speaker 1: So very quickly I realized that the answer is it's not at all.

506
00:24:26,314 --> 00:24:31,790
Speaker 1: They are related to each other in the same way that Bat and Birdwings are related to each other.

507
00:24:31,890 --> 00:24:32,011
Speaker 0: Right.

508
00:24:32,031 --> 00:24:41,199
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, I believe the author, having read Battle Royale, but I've seen Battle Royale, and I've read The Hunger Games, and I'll soon get the other two, so I'll have the quad pecta, right?

509
00:24:41,219 --> 00:24:43,330
Speaker 0: I'll read Battle Royale, and I'll watch The Hunger Games.

510
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:53,290
Speaker 0: But I believe the author, when she said that she had not even heard of Battle Royale, and that she didn't read it when her editor, whoever, told her not to, right?

511
00:24:53,690 --> 00:25:02,230
Speaker 0: So I believe her, but there are some similarities that it's like, clearly, you know, it just happens.

512
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:05,330
Speaker 0: There are ideas that people get, and the same ideas spread around.

513
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:09,510
Speaker 0: There are multiple people on Earth who have independently derived calculus.

514
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I guess my point is it's not a rip-off of Battle Royale at all.

515
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:28,238
Speaker 1: In fact, if anything, the way I saw she said something to the effect of she was watching some news reports and flipping channels and also seeing parts of a documentary, but it was kind of like a reality show, and between the two.

516
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:29,269
Speaker 1: it kind of gave her the idea.

517
00:25:29,731 --> 00:25:37,270
Speaker 1: Like, imagine if you were watching Schwarzenegger, Running Man, and Robocop, and the news in Iraq all at the same time.

518
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:39,630
Speaker 1: Like, I could see where that would cement the idea.

519
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:54,390
Speaker 1: But right away, this is much more, in my opinion, like 1984 than it is like Battle Royale, other than the surface of a bunch of people have to fight to the death in an arena, which is actually a very common... I mean, The Running Man, Arnold Schwarzenegger.

520
00:25:54,812 --> 00:25:55,689
Speaker 0: That is Mad Max.

521
00:25:58,093 --> 00:26:01,390
Speaker 0: But I think what it has in common is, okay, the fighting to the death in the arena, right?

522
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:06,066
Speaker 0: But it's the fact that it's children fighting to the death in an arena, which is a specific detail.

523
00:26:06,086 --> 00:26:07,130
Speaker 0: that's in common with Battle Royale.

524
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:13,230
Speaker 0: Also, you know, the fact that the per- why are they fighting in the arena, right?

525
00:26:13,290 --> 00:26:19,610
Speaker 0: And Running Man, you know, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Running Man, they're fighting to the death in the arena for entertainment and as a game show.

526
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,589
Speaker 1: No, but it's more than that.

527
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:31,150
Speaker 1: The Running Man is fighting for entertainment to distract, like it's very specifically to distract the masses from the fact that they live in a shitty world run by a dictatorship.

528
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,190
Speaker 0: Of course, same thing with Smash TV, right?

529
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:40,990
Speaker 0: But in Battle Royale and in The Hunger Games, the reason the children fight to the death is to basically teach everyone a lesson.

530
00:26:41,390 --> 00:26:43,524
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, we own you, right?

531
00:26:44,571 --> 00:26:47,190
Speaker 0: But at the same time, it's entertainment, right?

532
00:26:47,531 --> 00:26:48,615
Speaker 0: It's the dual purpose.

533
00:26:48,655 --> 00:26:52,850
Speaker 0: It's the 1984 and the Brave New World at the same time.

534
00:26:53,050 --> 00:26:53,970
Speaker 0: Now this is why I like this.

535
00:26:54,010 --> 00:26:58,350
Speaker 0: Look at this, and that's in common between both Battle Royale and, you know, Hunger Games.

536
00:26:58,550 --> 00:27:03,430
Speaker 0: Now I have to read- We're gonna scare the fuck out of you because you could be the next one to have to fight in these horrible games.

537
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:07,910
Speaker 0: But at the same time, watch these horrible games and be entertained at circuses.

538
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:12,450
Speaker 1: Ah, but I guess, I haven't read Battle Royale, but I've seen the movie.

539
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:13,229
Speaker 0: Ah, same here.

540
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:31,730
Speaker 1: And I've read Hunger Games, but Hunger Games at least, the world that was set up around the games makes a lot more sense in terms of why the games would be the way they are than the contrived world that was set up to make Battle Royale happen as it was portrayed in the movie.

541
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:36,247
Speaker 1: Yes, I have a feeling- In the movie, the movie was basically, "Uh, yeah, kids fight,

542
00:27:36,287 --> 00:27:36,368
Speaker 1: go!".

543
00:27:36,931 --> 00:27:40,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, but in the movie, you know, you definitely know that the world is like that.

544
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,889
Speaker 0: They just don't show the world that much.

545
00:27:43,292 --> 00:27:46,810
Speaker 0: I have a feeling, I don't know if it's true or not, because the book is so big.

546
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:49,910
Speaker 0: Alright, Hunger Games is a tiny book, you can read it so fast, two hours.

547
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,650
Speaker 1: I read it like on my flight to India.

548
00:27:51,890 --> 00:27:53,275
Speaker 0: I read it so fast, like a couple days.

549
00:27:53,335 --> 00:27:58,070
Speaker 0: In fact, I read all three of them, but I know Rym told me where the first one ends, so I won't talk about two and three.

550
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,249
Speaker 1: Yep, I'm gonna read the rest, but I've been busy.

551
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:07,770
Speaker 0: Battle Royale is such a large book, I don't, I imagine, in order to fill all of that text, they have to talk about the world more.

552
00:28:07,871 --> 00:28:09,109
Speaker 0: I can't imagine that they don't.

553
00:28:09,572 --> 00:28:11,950
Speaker 1: It could be like that awful Battle Royale manga.

554
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:13,830
Speaker 1: I heard the Battle Royale manga is not awful.

555
00:28:14,230 --> 00:28:16,730
Speaker 1: Uh, did you, how far did you read into it?

556
00:28:16,811 --> 00:28:17,270
Speaker 0: Two volumes.

557
00:28:17,672 --> 00:28:18,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is awful.

558
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,930
Speaker 0: It's not as bad as like Trigun manga, it's not awful, it's just, you know, it's a manga.

559
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:24,810
Speaker 1: No, I don't think, it is awful.

560
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:25,859
Speaker 0: Anyway.

561
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,950
Speaker 1: It is awful, and I don't like it.

562
00:28:27,950 --> 00:28:30,047
Speaker 0: We need a Hunger Games manga so we can match him up.

563
00:28:31,712 --> 00:28:33,150
Speaker 0: Someone get on that, this is a Twilight manga.

564
00:28:33,210 --> 00:28:35,680
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a comic, you know they're.

565
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:38,330
Speaker 1: well, what's the first thing you do with a successful franchise?

566
00:28:38,930 --> 00:28:40,170
Speaker 1: You make some shitty comic.

567
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:40,988
Speaker 0: Should I buy it?

568
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,330
Speaker 1: No, it'll be terrible.

569
00:28:43,050 --> 00:28:43,228
Speaker 0: Anyway.

570
00:28:43,410 --> 00:28:44,430
Speaker 1: Remember the Firefly comic?

571
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:45,129
Speaker 1: That thing was awful.

572
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:45,788
Speaker 0: I didn't read it.

573
00:28:46,110 --> 00:28:46,789
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was awful.

574
00:28:47,175 --> 00:28:47,389
Speaker 0: Okay.

575
00:28:48,091 --> 00:28:49,349
Speaker 1: Relative to Firefly, it was awful.

576
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:51,970
Speaker 1: It was a mediocre, like, you know, generic-o comic.

577
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,790
Speaker 0: Alright, so let's actually talk about Hunger Games.

578
00:28:54,030 --> 00:28:57,830
Speaker 1: But I guess, the whole, you know, again, one last thing, you know, book club.

579
00:28:58,632 --> 00:28:59,710
Speaker 1: We assume you've read the book.

580
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,350
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about it like you've read it and we've read it.

581
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:03,709
Speaker 1: So one, spoilers, duh.

582
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:06,270
Speaker 1: But two, we're not gonna explain the plot.

583
00:29:06,391 --> 00:29:08,610
Speaker 1: Because if you haven't read the book, why are you listening to this?

584
00:29:08,712 --> 00:29:09,290
Speaker 1: Read the book.

585
00:29:09,531 --> 00:29:15,190
Speaker 1: The point of the book club is that we come to the table with a shared understanding, a shared experience that we then discuss.

586
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:17,548
Speaker 0: So we do not need a plot summary because you've read it.

587
00:29:17,916 --> 00:29:18,127
Speaker 0: Yes.

588
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:18,670
Speaker 1: Okay.

589
00:29:18,690 --> 00:29:32,270
Speaker 0: So if you're confused- So, as a plot summary, the books- So, really, the details of the way the world was set up- You wanna do the one, two, three at the same time?

590
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,269
Speaker 0: Say your opinion of the book.

591
00:29:35,461 --> 00:29:35,650
Speaker 1: Alright.

592
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:37,301
Speaker 1: So it'll be one, two, go.

593
00:29:38,851 --> 00:29:42,390
Speaker 0: Well, you wanna do- no, on the show, they do one, two, three and then they say the word.

594
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,869
Speaker 1: So one, two, three, word?

595
00:29:44,272 --> 00:29:44,609
Speaker 0: That's right.

596
00:29:44,670 --> 00:29:48,030
Speaker 0: And your word is basically, you sum up your feelings about the book in one word.

597
00:29:48,191 --> 00:29:50,950
Speaker 0: That way, whatever my word is will not influence your word.

598
00:29:50,970 --> 00:29:57,669
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, yeah, but I don't like that because it's not consistent with rock, paper, scissors, which people fuck up all the time.

599
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:01,550
Speaker 0: Dude, I gotta talk to you about it later, but they do a weird rock, paper, scissors.

600
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:03,850
Speaker 1: Do they do the one where you have to look in the opposite direction of the point?

601
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:04,153
Speaker 1: No.

602
00:30:04,990 --> 00:30:05,033
Speaker 1: Oh.

603
00:30:05,733 --> 00:30:06,310
Speaker 0: Even different.

604
00:30:06,594 --> 00:30:07,790
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll talk about that later.

605
00:30:08,532 --> 00:30:09,340
Speaker 1: Alright, so let's go.

606
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:10,430
Speaker 1: one, two, three, blah.

607
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:10,885
Speaker 0: Alright.

608
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:11,322
Speaker 1: Ready?

609
00:30:12,012 --> 00:30:12,620
Speaker 1: One, two, three.

610
00:30:14,976 --> 00:30:15,305
Speaker 0: We agree.

611
00:30:15,990 --> 00:30:17,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, I liked it okay.

612
00:30:17,432 --> 00:30:18,570
Speaker 1: It was an enjoyable read.

613
00:30:19,011 --> 00:30:22,350
Speaker 0: It was definitely enjoyable, entertaining.

614
00:30:24,134 --> 00:30:25,589
Speaker 1: I got choked up a couple of times.

615
00:30:25,831 --> 00:30:27,529
Speaker 0: I didn't get choked up, but I wanted to read it.

616
00:30:28,692 --> 00:30:31,310
Speaker 0: It's like, I got home, if it wasn't done yet, I wanted to read it.

617
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:37,930
Speaker 1: It was the same thing with anime with any media, where some media, actually most media, start to consume it, and it's a chore.

618
00:30:38,130 --> 00:30:46,208
Speaker 1: I think, alright, I guess I should watch the next episode, but then you read something good, or watch something good, where you actually hit the end of a chapter, and you're like, I gotta read the next one.

619
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:51,270
Speaker 0: But, at the same time, it's like, I liked it, it was entertaining, whatever.

620
00:30:51,971 --> 00:31:00,890
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it'll entertain most people who read it, but it really wasn't that, as in terms of how quality is this.

621
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:01,750
Speaker 0: It's forgettable.

622
00:31:02,232 --> 00:31:05,810
Speaker 0: I put it in my own personal- It's a work of art.

623
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:11,430
Speaker 0: It's like you go to the museum, and you see something that's pretty eye-catching and cool, but it's never gonna be a masterpiece.

624
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:13,081
Speaker 0: It's never gonna be a history book.

625
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,309
Speaker 0: You're not gonna buy a print of it.

626
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:27,529
Speaker 1: It's on the same level, for me, as the first Fullmetal Alchemist anime, in that I liked it while I was reading it, mostly forgot about it as soon as I was done with it, and don't care to really consume it again.

627
00:31:27,750 --> 00:31:32,090
Speaker 0: I think it's like a half step under the lies of Locke Lamora, right?

628
00:31:33,331 --> 00:31:38,390
Speaker 0: It's like just a tiny bit step underneath, because at least- Oh my god, I want the next Locke Lamora book to come out.

629
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:45,870
Speaker 0: Right, because the lies of Locke Lamora had the thing that puts it a little bit above The Hunger Games, is that- Precursor technology?

630
00:31:46,736 --> 00:31:47,008
Speaker 0: Well, no.

631
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:48,210
Speaker 1: Well, they're in both, I guess.

632
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:57,869
Speaker 0: Is that, in the lies of Locke Lamora, the plotting was sort of clever, and you didn't know, and you were surprised, and it was, "Oh man, look how he pulled it off,".

633
00:31:57,949 --> 00:31:58,070
Speaker 0: right?

634
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,766
Speaker 0: In The Hunger Games, I knew exactly what was happening from page one to the hundredth page.

635
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:10,450
Speaker 1: It's like- When they announced the rules are changing, two people can survive, I immediately thought they're going to renounce that rule as soon as two people are left.

636
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:11,010
Speaker 0: That's right.

637
00:32:11,252 --> 00:32:13,610
Speaker 1: Every- That was Telegraph, that was Chekhov's sentence.

638
00:32:14,111 --> 00:32:15,430
Speaker 0: It was Chekhov book.

639
00:32:15,930 --> 00:32:20,037
Speaker 0: It was like, and I'm not even talking about just book one, I'm talking about one, two, three.

640
00:32:20,871 --> 00:32:22,048
Speaker 0: Chekhov wrote the whole three books.

641
00:32:22,970 --> 00:32:24,690
Speaker 0: Suzanne Chekhov wrote these books.

642
00:32:25,311 --> 00:32:27,190
Speaker 0: There were no secrets, no anything.

643
00:32:27,411 --> 00:32:31,370
Speaker 0: The foreshadowing was a bajillion, and it was blatant and obvious.

644
00:32:34,072 --> 00:32:40,549
Speaker 0: I think what would have made this awesome is if it was written more like Lord of the Flies, right?

645
00:32:40,754 --> 00:32:40,798
Speaker 0: No.

646
00:32:41,170 --> 00:32:47,570
Speaker 0: That would have been, because that would have put it over the top in terms of the quality of its awesomeness.

647
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:48,283
Speaker 0: Anyway.

648
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:58,570
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I really appreciated in the setting how plausible the rationale for these games are, that it's literally the punishment for a rebellion.

649
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,309
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing an ancient empire would do.

650
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,368
Speaker 1: Like, "Oh, you rebelled against us.

651
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:07,827
Speaker 1: Every year for the rest of time, the first child born in the year of May will be

652
00:33:07,908 --> 00:33:08,249
Speaker 1: murdered."

653
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,330
Speaker 1: You know, something like that.

654
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:13,850
Speaker 0: I did enjoy, there were a lot of things in there that were very realistic-ish, right?

655
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:18,570
Speaker 0: For example, obviously I don't know what goes on in a teenage girl's mind for real.

656
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:22,810
Speaker 1: That sounded a lot like what goes on in the mind of what I expect of teenage girls.

657
00:33:23,372 --> 00:33:28,588
Speaker 0: But reading it, if someone told me, "Yeah, that's exactly how teenage girls think," I believe it.

658
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:34,669
Speaker 0: And people who have been or are teenage girls told me that that is in fact the case, and so I believe it.

659
00:33:34,790 --> 00:33:38,010
Speaker 0: Also, consider how they portray the people from the Capitol, right?

660
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:42,190
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, the Capitol is the evil place, but it's a lot like the United States.

661
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,549
Speaker 0: It's like not everyone who lives there is evil.

662
00:33:43,752 --> 00:33:44,970
Speaker 0: They just live in the good place.

663
00:33:45,151 --> 00:33:45,848
Speaker 1: That's how they do.

664
00:33:45,930 --> 00:33:59,668
Speaker 1: But also, I really like the way the people in the Capitol were portrayed with their kind of over-the-top makeup, and it really reminded me of the Running Man kind of world, especially with Caesar, the announcer.

665
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:08,949
Speaker 0: I actually want to see the movie, because the only images I've seen from the movie are Katniss with bow and arrow in the woods kind of pictures, right?

666
00:34:09,271 --> 00:34:13,297
Speaker 0: I want to see what the Capitol looks like in the movie, because I always love looking at futuristic stuff.

667
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:16,389
Speaker 0: Is it going to be dark and Blade Runner-y?

668
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,469
Speaker 0: Because I don't imagine it that way.

669
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:21,190
Speaker 0: I imagine it would be bright and shiny, more like a Wizard of Oz kind of Emerald City.

670
00:34:21,190 --> 00:34:22,550
Speaker 1: I want to see the train into the Capitol.

671
00:34:23,070 --> 00:34:24,650
Speaker 1: I want to see the fire dress.

672
00:34:25,393 --> 00:34:25,645
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

673
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:28,230
Speaker 0: I want to see all that kind of stuff, right?

674
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:33,286
Speaker 1: I really want to see Caesar, because that announcer reminded me so much of the Running Man announcer.

675
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:34,690
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

676
00:34:35,091 --> 00:34:39,210
Speaker 1: I like that style of dude, because I like how he's kind of a good guy, too.

677
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:40,904
Speaker 1: He does his best.

678
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:44,829
Speaker 1: He really wants to help these kids out, but yet he's part of this horrible system.

679
00:34:46,030 --> 00:34:46,907
Speaker 0: He's just doing what he do.

680
00:34:47,231 --> 00:34:55,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he's genuinely pretty funny, actually, when you actually get what he's saying, though half the time you're stuck in Katniss's head with her whining about boys while he's talking.

681
00:34:56,070 --> 00:35:03,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, apparently from what I've heard is that in the movie you don't really hear what she's thinking, but basically the book is entirely in Katniss's head all the time.

682
00:35:03,750 --> 00:35:10,789
Speaker 0: And some people who saw the movie first or whatever were bothered by the reversal, like they wanted to know or they didn't want to.

683
00:35:11,231 --> 00:35:11,501
Speaker 0: I don't know.

684
00:35:12,473 --> 00:35:19,489
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I've heard that it's at least obvious what she's thinking if you watch the movie, like the body language is well acted and such.

685
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:24,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, generally the plausibility of a lot of the situations, right, was really comforting.

686
00:35:24,430 --> 00:35:35,149
Speaker 1: In fact, the only false note, like the genetic stuff with the Mockingjays, I actually, that was cool, too, because this is a post-apocalyptic America, so stuff like that actually sets it in time pretty well.

687
00:35:35,551 --> 00:35:44,290
Speaker 1: But those fucking genetic wolves at the end of the first book, one, out of nowhere, two, false note compared to everything else in the book, and three, stupid.

688
00:35:44,650 --> 00:35:45,349
Speaker 0: Yep, I agree.

689
00:35:46,275 --> 00:35:47,130
Speaker 1: That just shouldn't have been there.

690
00:35:47,150 --> 00:36:01,830
Speaker 0: The other thing that bothered me, but it didn't bother me, but it was an implausible thing, right, was like this, you know, the separation of the numbered districts, right, is like they're in this big long line going to the capital with the one train connecting them.

691
00:36:02,350 --> 00:36:08,770
Speaker 0: That's such a contrived geographic situation, sort of like DMZ, the comic.

692
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:09,924
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, DMZ.

693
00:36:10,350 --> 00:36:21,288
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, OK, even if there was this horrible thing that happened, it wouldn't be like that, where like, you know, number this is mining and number this is technology, it's like it wouldn't happen like that.

694
00:36:21,451 --> 00:36:23,370
Speaker 1: Nope, that was very contrived.

695
00:36:23,610 --> 00:36:24,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, extremely contrived.

696
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:32,630
Speaker 0: Just, it seemed like that's the kind of thing that you would make up for an RPG setting, right, you know, sort of like paranoia, like the different colors.

697
00:36:33,093 --> 00:36:33,163
Speaker 1: Yep.

698
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,490
Speaker 0: You know, very contrived.

699
00:36:34,810 --> 00:36:35,530
Speaker 0: But other than that, it was fine.

700
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:37,232
Speaker 1: Ah.

701
00:36:39,113 --> 00:36:41,030
Speaker 0: What else is there to say about this game?

702
00:36:41,871 --> 00:36:46,870
Speaker 1: I mean, I like how it really focused a lot more on food and water and basic stuff than the fighting.

703
00:36:47,130 --> 00:36:48,269
Speaker 1: The fighting was kind of just there.

704
00:36:49,171 --> 00:36:57,269
Speaker 1: I appreciate, too, how unlike Battle Royale, the fight itself, like the actual games, the rules were really well thought out.

705
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:00,490
Speaker 0: Well, in Battle Royale, the rules are pretty well thought out.

706
00:37:00,710 --> 00:37:10,823
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was a little, I don't know, this was more like if like you, me and Luke Crane and Jared sat down and someone was like, "You guys have to design a game where kids fight to the death and we film

707
00:37:10,864 --> 00:37:10,924
Speaker 1: it.".

708
00:37:11,370 --> 00:37:12,550
Speaker 0: Well, in Battle Royale...

709
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:14,950
Speaker 1: Like the rule around the cornucopia in the beginning was great.

710
00:37:15,254 --> 00:37:16,330
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, that's... That was awesome.

711
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:16,908
Speaker 0: That's clever, right?

712
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:24,110
Speaker 0: But I mean, you know, I think Battle Royale, because it's, you know, it seems like it's a very Japanese thing, is those situational things.

713
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,010
Speaker 0: Look at Death Note with its rules, right?

714
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:30,650
Speaker 0: Or look at Nine Doors, Nine Hours, Nine Persons, right?

715
00:37:30,793 --> 00:37:31,323
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, 9-9-9-9.

716
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:37,510
Speaker 0: Right, with all the, they always come with these rules, you know, and the rules involve like, you know, technology, enforcing things, right?

717
00:37:37,771 --> 00:37:44,688
Speaker 0: And that seems like something that happens in Japanese books, movies, stories, mangas, et cetera, right?

718
00:37:44,990 --> 00:37:57,310
Speaker 0: Whereas, you know, this isn't Japanese, so it, you know, even though it's one of those situational things, you know, the situation isn't the whole book, it's just this one part of the book and it doesn't go into that same sort of, you know, complexity.

719
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:02,990
Speaker 0: So in Battle Royale, the rules are you have a necklace, if you fuck up, they explode the necklace.

720
00:38:03,492 --> 00:38:14,242
Speaker 0: There's different zones and you get a map and you have to be in the right zones at the right times, otherwise, if you go in an unallowed zone for you, then your necklace explodes, you know.

721
00:38:14,972 --> 00:38:18,350
Speaker 0: Ah, but look, the necklace- Maybe try to escape it explodes, if you try to remove it, it explodes.

722
00:38:18,370 --> 00:38:25,010
Speaker 0: See, that's the thing, the sudden exploding- And then when the time runs out at the end of the game, if you're not the only one left alive, it all explodes.

723
00:38:25,110 --> 00:38:29,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, but see, those rules, from a, you know, entertainment perspective, kind of suck.

724
00:38:30,033 --> 00:38:30,469
Speaker 0: That's true.

725
00:38:30,970 --> 00:38:35,990
Speaker 1: Like, this is much better in that it seems to be designed to force the conflict and have a camera there.

726
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:41,590
Speaker 1: I like how it really focused on the details of how would they stage this, the fact that she's always worried about-

727
00:38:41,590 --> 00:38:48,187
Speaker 0: That was awesome, how she was always thinking in the meta, the way we would think in the meta of like, you know, oh, you know-

728
00:38:48,730 --> 00:38:51,570
Speaker 1: The camera can see me, I'd better, you know, make this kind of face.

729
00:38:51,790 --> 00:38:58,768
Speaker 0: And I think that's why she was successful, because she could think about it in that way, you know, because she had been watching them at home, right, everyone's forced to watch them, right?

730
00:38:59,171 --> 00:39:08,760
Speaker 0: So, you know, in thinking about, you know, this is a thing for entertainment, so the way to win is this, and that's just like, as you know, as the author said, reality shows, right?

731
00:39:09,130 --> 00:39:20,970
Speaker 0: If you were to win on the reality show, you have to, you know, you can't just, you know, play the games by the rules and try to win and be boring, because they'll find some way to get you out of there by changing the rules or whatever bullshit, because that's what reality shows do, right?

732
00:39:21,051 --> 00:39:22,010
Speaker 0: They just try to be entertaining.

733
00:39:22,490 --> 00:39:38,749
Speaker 0: The way you win the reality show is by, you know, pleasing the producers and pleasing the audience at home, you know, by doing things that make you, you know, liked and appeal and, you know, do things that cause entertaining situations, even if it's putting yourself in danger, but at the same time, don't die.

734
00:39:40,230 --> 00:39:49,250
Speaker 0: And you know, the fact that she could think about it in the meta gave her this big advantage, but also was a way for you to have, you know, the full perspective, right?

735
00:39:50,070 --> 00:40:03,890
Speaker 0: Instead of, they could have done something where like, you know, they cut between her in the game and people watching at home, but they didn't have to do that, because her meta thinking was what the people at home and also the producers are thinking, so you got every perspective.

736
00:40:04,250 --> 00:40:08,950
Speaker 1: Which is probably why in the movie, from what I can tell, they do cut a lot more to the people at home watching.

737
00:40:09,330 --> 00:40:26,568
Speaker 0: Right, because this way, in the book, because you know what she's thinking and she's thinking from every angle, you get the full perspective on the games, even though it's entirely from the point of view of one person, whereas in the movie, if they don't, you know, do voiceover or something with her thoughts, you would need to cut away to get the other perspectives on the game.

738
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:33,869
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you would just have sort of like this, you know, FPS half-life kind of view of Gordon Freeman trying to survive and that's it.

739
00:40:34,010 --> 00:40:34,191
Speaker 0: But I

740
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:50,007
Speaker 1: like how this sets up a really nice contrast between, you know, the Katniss perceived by the people and what she's really thinking, because she is a much more normal, like she's just a teenage girl, but yet she, you know, she has this very different persona as far as people see her.

741
00:40:51,071 --> 00:40:53,265
Speaker 1: And I really like reality shows.

742
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:54,070
Speaker 0: do again, right?

743
00:40:54,110 --> 00:40:57,108
Speaker 0: It's like if I want a reality show, they wouldn't portray me the way I am.

744
00:40:57,410 --> 00:41:01,670
Speaker 0: They would try to come up with some way to label me and, you know, characterize me.

745
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:06,871
Speaker 0: And they would cut and edit so that, you know, maybe they portrayed me as angry guy or nerdy guy.

746
00:41:06,911 --> 00:41:11,529
Speaker 1: Remember how they showed the thing with Rue, but they didn't show the flowers.

747
00:41:11,951 --> 00:41:13,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

748
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,690
Speaker 1: Those notes really rang true.

749
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:18,270
Speaker 1: I also really liked how Katniss actually tried to win.

750
00:41:18,611 --> 00:41:26,830
Speaker 1: And while she cared about the people around her and through some luck didn't have to kill some people she liked, she had no qualms about killing someone when it came to it.

751
00:41:27,170 --> 00:41:27,612
Speaker 0: That's true.

752
00:41:27,692 --> 00:41:28,134
Speaker 0: She didn't.

753
00:41:28,234 --> 00:41:33,729
Speaker 0: But I think that was also maybe because it was a young adult novel, but they really set it up.

754
00:41:33,830 --> 00:41:35,848
Speaker 0: So she never actually had to do.

755
00:41:36,250 --> 00:41:39,150
Speaker 1: No, she killed the dude who killed Rue just like without even thinking.

756
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:41,630
Speaker 0: Of course, but she never had to kill a good person.

757
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:48,230
Speaker 0: You know, they would they always hinted and it could have come up and it was always a possibility, but it just never actually did.

758
00:41:48,270 --> 00:41:49,690
Speaker 0: And it feels like she got away with one.

759
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:50,111
Speaker 0: Right.

760
00:41:50,131 --> 00:41:55,969
Speaker 0: In reality, you know, if this actually went down, it's probably you wouldn't get off so easy that way.

761
00:41:56,291 --> 00:42:00,798
Speaker 0: You know, you'd probably have to kill or be killed by people that you liked and were good people.

762
00:42:01,043 --> 00:42:01,430
Speaker 1: Of course.

763
00:42:01,811 --> 00:42:03,209
Speaker 0: It's just the way things played out.

764
00:42:03,350 --> 00:42:04,729
Speaker 0: Good people never had to kill the good.

765
00:42:05,150 --> 00:42:07,016
Speaker 1: Of course.

766
00:42:07,036 --> 00:42:12,810
Speaker 1: I was a question, do you think if they hadn't backed down at the end, she would have they would have really killed themselves?

767
00:42:13,090 --> 00:42:13,598
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

768
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:14,228
Speaker 1: So.

769
00:42:15,813 --> 00:42:17,709
Speaker 1: All the good people left could have done that together.

770
00:42:18,632 --> 00:42:20,749
Speaker 1: So there was still a way they could have.

771
00:42:21,411 --> 00:42:27,829
Speaker 0: So so because I mentioned, but but the thing is, there weren't enough good people left because of the order in which people died.

772
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:28,131
Speaker 0: Right.

773
00:42:28,191 --> 00:42:32,392
Speaker 0: It was them two and Rue, maybe, you know, but who knows how Rue would have felt about it.

774
00:42:32,412 --> 00:42:35,650
Speaker 0: But I know that Peta and Katniss definitely would have gone through with it.

775
00:42:36,272 --> 00:42:37,965
Speaker 0: But it's like even if you're a good person, right.

776
00:42:39,353 --> 00:42:40,990
Speaker 0: You know, would you necessarily go through with it?

777
00:42:41,150 --> 00:42:42,295
Speaker 0: Maybe, you know, like.

778
00:42:42,356 --> 00:42:52,669
Speaker 0: if you imagine if like, you know, a couple of us and some other good people were standing there and it's like, you know, you're thinking about like, OK, maybe we'll all maybe we'll pick a person we want to win.

779
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:55,350
Speaker 0: But, you know, and maybe that person just can't do it.

780
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,869
Speaker 0: They can't bring themselves to go through with it.

781
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:57,996
Speaker 0: So we'll win for them.

782
00:42:58,056 --> 00:42:58,821
Speaker 0: You know, it's like you would.

783
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:01,120
Speaker 0: you would be a different situation depending.

784
00:43:01,141 --> 00:43:01,769
Speaker 0: Right.

785
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:02,471
Speaker 1: Yeah.

786
00:43:02,551 --> 00:43:07,669
Speaker 1: Of course, at the same time, they did a good job of making it obvious that Katniss kind of had to win.

787
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:12,789
Speaker 1: Like she couldn't just abandon her family and an act of rebellion like that would have endangered all the people she left behind.

788
00:43:13,011 --> 00:43:13,232
Speaker 1: Yeah.

789
00:43:13,534 --> 00:43:16,190
Speaker 1: So it was set up well to where it was the difficult choice.

790
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:19,369
Speaker 1: But because I mentioned Rue, I liked her character, but.

791
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:31,450
Speaker 1: I'm amazed at the number of people who freaked out that she was portrayed as not white in the movie, even though she is clearly dark brown in the book.

792
00:43:32,071 --> 00:43:32,292
Speaker 0: Yeah.

793
00:43:32,734 --> 00:43:33,798
Speaker 1: How do people not?

794
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:41,609
Speaker 1: it's kind of like how people are surprised when you tell them that the wizards Ursula K. Le Guin, like, you know, that they're not white.

795
00:43:41,872 --> 00:43:43,203
Speaker 0: But it says right there.

796
00:43:43,244 --> 00:43:43,930
Speaker 0: they're not white.

797
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:44,734
Speaker 0: It's like.

798
00:43:44,774 --> 00:43:47,269
Speaker 0: the first thing says it in plain text.

799
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:49,430
Speaker 0: This is this is the thing that happens a lot.

800
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:50,534
Speaker 0: It actually happens to me.

801
00:43:50,594 --> 00:43:57,591
Speaker 0: So I can understand it is you read a book and they'll introduce a character and sometimes they introduce a character like, for example, Katniss.

802
00:43:57,612 --> 00:44:02,278
Speaker 0: They only really describe like her braided hair and not too much about her appearance in the book.

803
00:44:02,399 --> 00:44:03,449
Speaker 1: I think olive ish skin.

804
00:44:03,771 --> 00:44:04,053
Speaker 0: Yeah.

805
00:44:04,335 --> 00:44:06,710
Speaker 0: And they only describe it once at the beginning.

806
00:44:06,872 --> 00:44:07,662
Speaker 0: And that's it.

807
00:44:08,007 --> 00:44:08,250
Speaker 0: Right.

808
00:44:08,451 --> 00:44:19,335
Speaker 0: They don't, you know, and they'll describe later on like, oh, she got a scar here or modifications, but they won't redescribe her whole appearance at any point other than the introductory part.

809
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:28,278
Speaker 0: So if you weren't paying close attention, then you've already built this image of the person in your mind based on whatever your prejudices are in your brain.

810
00:44:28,298 --> 00:44:28,400
Speaker 0: Right.

811
00:44:29,832 --> 00:44:32,629
Speaker 0: And now that's stuck in there and it's hard to modify it.

812
00:44:33,292 --> 00:44:34,497
Speaker 0: So you had to pay.

813
00:44:34,537 --> 00:44:42,490
Speaker 0: when you're reading a book, you have to play really close attention to those initial character appearance descriptions or your image in your brain.

814
00:44:42,931 --> 00:44:47,650
Speaker 0: You know, obviously, it's never going to be exactly the same, even if you do pay close attention to that description.

815
00:44:48,211 --> 00:44:56,350
Speaker 0: But it's going to be way the fuck off and racist or who knows what if you just make one up based on nothing, because you didn't pay you didn't read the words carefully.

816
00:44:56,730 --> 00:45:00,330
Speaker 1: That's fine unless you find out on the Internet when it got right.

817
00:45:00,971 --> 00:45:02,729
Speaker 0: You know, like he doesn't look the way you expect, you know.

818
00:45:02,790 --> 00:45:03,904
Speaker 0: So if that happened to me.

819
00:45:03,924 --> 00:45:04,430
Speaker 0: Right.

820
00:45:04,491 --> 00:45:06,410
Speaker 0: And I perhaps, you know, it's only two words.

821
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:09,190
Speaker 0: Anyone could, you know, reading quickly, you know, dark skin.

822
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:10,017
Speaker 0: You can miss that.

823
00:45:10,098 --> 00:45:11,230
Speaker 1: I guess shooting the reaction of Ben.

824
00:45:11,671 --> 00:45:12,676
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess she was black.

825
00:45:13,158 --> 00:45:15,430
Speaker 0: You can legitimately miss that.

826
00:45:15,611 --> 00:45:18,650
Speaker 0: And if you do legitimately miss it, then don't freak out on the Internet.

827
00:45:18,770 --> 00:45:19,675
Speaker 0: Go look at the book again.

828
00:45:19,695 --> 00:45:33,790
Speaker 0: And if you see that you are wrong, be like, oh, and if there isn't a lot of times there isn't a description, a complete description of what someone looks like, in which case whatever you make up is fine, you know, and then in the movie they have complete creative freedom to do whatever they want.

829
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:35,469
Speaker 0: Maybe ask the author, you know.

830
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:38,209
Speaker 0: I mean, like, you know, I mean, I'm going to tell you something right now.

831
00:45:38,673 --> 00:45:40,450
Speaker 0: When I read Lord of the Rings, right.

832
00:45:40,650 --> 00:45:44,430
Speaker 0: Originally back in the middle school days, you thought Bilbo was nine feet tall.

833
00:45:44,913 --> 00:45:45,808
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

834
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,089
Speaker 0: I knew what hobbits look like.

835
00:45:48,571 --> 00:45:48,852
Speaker 0: Right.

836
00:45:49,074 --> 00:45:51,730
Speaker 0: But elves, I imagine like Santa Claus elves like really.

837
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:52,371
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

838
00:45:52,572 --> 00:45:52,893
Speaker 0: I didn't.

839
00:45:53,435 --> 00:45:59,036
Speaker 0: I didn't know like, you know, tall, wavy, pointy eared elf like D&D style until way later.

840
00:45:59,056 --> 00:46:00,203
Speaker 0: I didn't even think of that as an.

841
00:46:00,223 --> 00:46:02,013
Speaker 0: I didn't even think of that as like anything.

842
00:46:02,315 --> 00:46:04,810
Speaker 0: That was not an image in my brain until much later.

843
00:46:04,930 --> 00:46:12,770
Speaker 1: Maybe it's because when I thought it, but I have never had a perception of elves that was not Tolkien-esque elves even before I read Tolkien.

844
00:46:13,191 --> 00:46:13,291
Speaker 0: Yeah.

845
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,110
Speaker 0: I mean, I read Tolkien and I wasn't imagining Tolkien-esque elves.

846
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:17,789
Speaker 0: I was imagining Santa Claus elves.

847
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:18,650
Speaker 0: Right.

848
00:46:18,891 --> 00:46:24,889
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, Rivendell is a place full of tiny elves like, hey, you know, and I guess I had the dwarves right.

849
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,341
Speaker 0: But the dwarves, well, I had the dwarves.

850
00:46:27,562 --> 00:46:28,910
Speaker 0: physical-ness, right.

851
00:46:29,091 --> 00:46:30,290
Speaker 0: You know, short, right.

852
00:46:30,791 --> 00:46:34,430
Speaker 0: But I imagine them like, you know, wearing like David the gnome clothes.

853
00:46:34,672 --> 00:46:36,489
Speaker 0: And not wearing like, you know, armors.

854
00:46:38,131 --> 00:46:39,118
Speaker 0: That's just me.

855
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,909
Speaker 0: You know, obviously I have it right now.

856
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:51,749
Speaker 0: I'm not wrong anymore, but that's the kind of thing that can happen to someone if you don't pay extremely close attention to the physical appearance descriptions at the character introduction stage of any novel.

857
00:46:53,171 --> 00:46:53,990
Speaker 1: So, I mean, I don't know.

858
00:46:54,130 --> 00:46:57,270
Speaker 1: I don't have any other specific points that really stood out.

859
00:46:57,490 --> 00:47:02,250
Speaker 1: I mean, I think I've covered every thing that was memorable or annoying or good.

860
00:47:02,330 --> 00:47:03,109
Speaker 0: Well, it's in the first book.

861
00:47:03,231 --> 00:47:03,494
Speaker 0: Yeah.

862
00:47:03,656 --> 00:47:03,918
Speaker 0: Right.

863
00:47:04,242 --> 00:47:04,970
Speaker 1: I haven't read the rest.

864
00:47:05,090 --> 00:47:08,375
Speaker 1: I read some spoilers and I don't think I like the other books as much as I like the first one.

865
00:47:08,638 --> 00:47:09,550
Speaker 0: Do I like the other?

866
00:47:09,610 --> 00:47:13,849
Speaker 0: I think they're all you know, the thing is, it's one of those ones where they all flow together into the same thing.

867
00:47:14,230 --> 00:47:15,193
Speaker 0: Yeah.

868
00:47:15,755 --> 00:47:20,234
Speaker 0: You know, and because, you know, and the whole thing, you know, I mean, it was all good.

869
00:47:20,255 --> 00:47:21,650
Speaker 0: I mean, I read to the end.

870
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:21,791
Speaker 0: Right.

871
00:47:21,812 --> 00:47:23,109
Speaker 0: If it wasn't good, I wouldn't have kept reading.

872
00:47:23,810 --> 00:47:29,637
Speaker 0: But it was like I said, check off everything right up to the end, 100 percent all the way to the end of the third book.

873
00:47:30,061 --> 00:47:31,049
Speaker 0: Check off all the way.

874
00:47:31,452 --> 00:47:34,790
Speaker 0: So, you know, none of it really felt, you know, profound.

875
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,200
Speaker 1: And I have one question for you.

876
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:37,590
Speaker 1: Do those fucking wolves come back?

877
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:39,296
Speaker 0: They're mentioned.

878
00:47:39,316 --> 00:47:41,210
Speaker 0: They don't actually come.

879
00:47:41,290 --> 00:47:42,034
Speaker 1: OK, that's good.

880
00:47:42,295 --> 00:47:42,857
Speaker 0: But there were.

881
00:47:42,998 --> 00:47:46,496
Speaker 0: there are scenes where a character remember them and be haunted by that.

882
00:47:46,859 --> 00:47:48,250
Speaker 1: I remind me of them.

883
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:49,989
Speaker 1: You know, did you put those in the book?

884
00:47:50,391 --> 00:47:52,130
Speaker 0: They'll just be like, you know, it's a quick thing.

885
00:47:52,190 --> 00:48:03,289
Speaker 0: It's not like a long, drawn out thing where someone, you know, but it'll be like someone has a nightmare that has the wolf in it or someone is thinking about something and is like, oh, man, what if something like those horrible wolves comes back?

886
00:48:03,710 --> 00:48:06,029
Speaker 1: I just I don't understand why those wolves are in the book.

887
00:48:06,632 --> 00:48:07,476
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know.

888
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:10,110
Speaker 0: Just the thing they needed to come up with hazards.

889
00:48:10,251 --> 00:48:12,269
Speaker 0: And that's what they came could have just been wolves.

890
00:48:13,211 --> 00:48:17,031
Speaker 0: It could have been, but I guess they were trying to, I don't know, make a point about something.

891
00:48:17,432 --> 00:48:22,950
Speaker 0: That's another thing is that the book doesn't really make any subtle points.

892
00:48:23,736 --> 00:48:25,070
Speaker 1: No, it's up against tyranny.

893
00:48:25,491 --> 00:48:36,054
Speaker 0: But at the same time, you can't fault someone for not rising up because it's all this symbolism is just blatant and not even not even blatant, but like literally explained.

894
00:48:36,255 --> 00:48:40,491
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's not like well, like I said, Lord of the Flies before, right?

895
00:48:40,511 --> 00:48:42,730
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, that kid is Jesus.

896
00:48:43,231 --> 00:48:49,609
Speaker 0: But this in, you know, in friggin Hunger Games, it would actually have the words, yeah, that kid is Jesus.

897
00:48:49,851 --> 00:48:54,250
Speaker 0: You know, it's like they literally tell you what all the thing, you know, and they'll do it.

898
00:48:54,411 --> 00:49:07,769
Speaker 0: They'll even repeat, you know, in case you forgot what a thing means, you know, like for example, you know, the Mockingjay symbolizes, you know, the fact that, you know, that literally the Mockingjays mocked the empire when it tried to use it.

899
00:49:08,270 --> 00:49:08,551
Speaker 0: Exactly.

900
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:20,029
Speaker 0: And they'll actually explain that in words, whereas what they could have done to be subtle and intelligent would be tell the story of where the Mockingjays came from and, you know, what happened with them and just let it be.

901
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:27,690
Speaker 1: And then people like us and then would say something like, ah, but notice how the symbol of the rebellion is the Mockingjays, the symbol is the Mockingjay.

902
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:38,713
Speaker 0: Do you remember that the story of the Mockingjay was about these birds, right, that were a weapon, the, you know, the capital used against the people, but got turned against them.

903
00:49:39,034 --> 00:49:39,275
Speaker 0: Right.

904
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:49,450
Speaker 0: And notice how that is so similar to the fact that how, you know, Katniss is used as a weapon against the people in the Hunger Games and then she turned against them and mocked them.

905
00:49:49,830 --> 00:49:51,850
Speaker 1: It sounds like there's basically paragraphs like that in the book.

906
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:55,850
Speaker 0: There are paragraphs in the book that basically say exactly that and they'll remind you of it.

907
00:49:55,891 --> 00:50:08,110
Speaker 0: It's like they'll tell the story of the Mockingjay and then in the second, third books, they'll tell the story again to explain it, because, you know, it's like, OK, for a young adult book, you know, lower reading levels, you know, it's understandable.

908
00:50:08,831 --> 00:50:11,710
Speaker 0: But, you know, it doesn't make the book better.

909
00:50:12,013 --> 00:50:13,046
Speaker 0: You could have just left that out.

910
00:50:14,791 --> 00:50:21,870
Speaker 1: Also, the word mutations is kind of dumb, that is a dumb word, it doesn't fit with the flow of the rest of the proper nouns at all.

911
00:50:22,130 --> 00:50:24,110
Speaker 0: No, you're really upset about these wolves.

912
00:50:24,575 --> 00:50:25,850
Speaker 1: They really pissed me off.

913
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:26,173
Speaker 0: They did.

914
00:50:26,275 --> 00:50:27,029
Speaker 0: I mean, I do agree.

915
00:50:27,270 --> 00:50:29,510
Speaker 1: Like when the wolves came, I was like, all right, some monsters.

916
00:50:29,631 --> 00:50:30,235
Speaker 1: This is the end.

917
00:50:30,316 --> 00:50:33,890
Speaker 0: And then you get to the end of that first book and it's like, all right, there's got to be some climactic thing.

918
00:50:33,992 --> 00:50:35,008
Speaker 0: And it's like that was it.

919
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:38,329
Speaker 0: And it's like, whoa, it kind of it was kind of like a weird doink.

920
00:50:38,552 --> 00:50:39,670
Speaker 1: And they didn't do anything with it.

921
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:41,430
Speaker 1: It's not like the wolves had any like memory.

922
00:50:41,912 --> 00:50:44,170
Speaker 1: It's not like there was a hesitation or any character.

923
00:50:44,270 --> 00:50:47,670
Speaker 1: It was just random bullshit out of nowhere.

924
00:50:48,070 --> 00:50:48,191
Speaker 0: Yeah.

925
00:50:48,734 --> 00:50:51,750
Speaker 0: Also, the fact that it was, you know, the blatant trilogy.

926
00:50:51,991 --> 00:50:52,211
Speaker 0: Right.

927
00:50:52,272 --> 00:50:59,829
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, I like it better when someone writes a first book and there's no assumption that there's going to be more books.

928
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:07,550
Speaker 0: So that book is like contained and completed, you know, as opposed if you go into it knowing it's going to be a trilogy or a quadrigy or whatever.

929
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:08,472
Speaker 0: Right.

930
00:51:08,835 --> 00:51:11,349
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, you found good breaking points to split it up.

931
00:51:11,751 --> 00:51:15,250
Speaker 0: But I almost sort of feel like why not just make one big ass book?

932
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:17,670
Speaker 1: Because then we would not yet have even heard of the Prince of Nothing.

933
00:51:19,032 --> 00:51:22,109
Speaker 0: Hey, they could know we could have had one big ass book of the first three.

934
00:51:22,573 --> 00:51:24,009
Speaker 1: That would have come out not that long ago.

935
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:24,734
Speaker 0: That's fine.

936
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:26,530
Speaker 1: And then we would have said, what the fuck?

937
00:51:26,610 --> 00:51:27,256
Speaker 1: Where's the rest?

938
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:28,650
Speaker 1: And then still waiting.

939
00:51:29,151 --> 00:51:30,890
Speaker 0: Well, you know, he would have made it a complete.

940
00:51:32,830 --> 00:51:38,453
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like it better when people write complete thingies that stand alone and then also go together.

941
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:38,695
Speaker 0: Right.

942
00:51:38,755 --> 00:51:42,580
Speaker 0: When things are only going together, you start heading into superhero comic territory.

943
00:51:42,822 --> 00:51:43,530
Speaker 1: No, it depends.

944
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:44,363
Speaker 1: There's a fine line.

945
00:51:44,383 --> 00:51:44,689
Speaker 0: There is.

946
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:47,630
Speaker 0: It's not exactly the same, but I'm saying heads in that direction.

947
00:51:48,991 --> 00:51:49,874
Speaker 0: Is there anything else saying?

948
00:51:50,395 --> 00:51:51,659
Speaker 1: I'm amazed at the.

949
00:51:51,679 --> 00:51:53,183
Speaker 1: I don't like.

950
00:51:53,785 --> 00:51:56,690
Speaker 1: I guess I can see why it's so popular in retrospect.

951
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:57,191
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

952
00:51:57,231 --> 00:52:07,330
Speaker 1: But I'm surprised how quickly this caught like the fire of this book spread catching fire at much, much in the same pattern that Twilight did.

953
00:52:07,451 --> 00:52:10,590
Speaker 1: But I'm glad because Twilight is pretty shit compared to this.

954
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:11,213
Speaker 0: That's true.

955
00:52:11,274 --> 00:52:13,270
Speaker 1: So I'm glad this is the new popular thing.

956
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,049
Speaker 0: And it doesn't take long to read.

957
00:52:15,291 --> 00:52:25,789
Speaker 0: So even if, you know, your highbrow, you could read this and if you in, you know, it's not as quick as, you know, little prints, but you can read this in like a day or two after work and that'll be it.

958
00:52:26,132 --> 00:52:27,888
Speaker 0: And then if you want, you can read the other two.

959
00:52:29,012 --> 00:52:31,150
Speaker 0: I actually I'm gonna be honest, I've pirated books two and three.

960
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:31,672
Speaker 0: You know why?

961
00:52:32,175 --> 00:52:34,670
Speaker 0: Not because they were hardcover only and I don't buy hardcover.

962
00:52:36,271 --> 00:52:44,030
Speaker 1: I do also in terms of like the books themselves, like the selling and the reading and everything in the movie and Emily, I talk about this a lot.

963
00:52:44,110 --> 00:53:00,790
Speaker 1: It seems like young adult books like this that can be interpreted kind of loosely like books that aren't that great, but have a good core where you can really like fudge and add details when you adapt them to movies tend to make really good movies compared to literal remakes of books.

964
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:01,781
Speaker 1: I haven't seen the movie.

965
00:53:01,801 --> 00:53:02,350
Speaker 0: I haven't either.

966
00:53:03,453 --> 00:53:09,069
Speaker 1: So this is what I'm guessing I'm going to feel like when I see this because I've seen it happen with other similar works.

967
00:53:09,752 --> 00:53:16,169
Speaker 1: And with this in particular, from the scenes I've seen from trailers, I think I will enjoy the movie more than I enjoyed the book.

968
00:53:16,690 --> 00:53:17,314
Speaker 0: You know what I think?

969
00:53:17,334 --> 00:53:23,690
Speaker 1: Because the writing of the book, while it was serviceable, much like Locke Lamora was serviceable, it was it was no Hawthorne.

970
00:53:24,490 --> 00:53:25,134
Speaker 0: You know what I think.

971
00:53:25,174 --> 00:53:30,550
Speaker 0: it is, you know, I think makes these things popular and also makes Harry Potter popular and Twilight and all these sorts of things.

972
00:53:30,691 --> 00:53:30,872
Speaker 0: Right.

973
00:53:31,758 --> 00:53:33,670
Speaker 0: I think it's mostly world world building.

974
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:34,231
Speaker 0: Right.

975
00:53:34,251 --> 00:53:37,449
Speaker 1: Well, look at the way I went to Wikipedia to remember who wrote this.

976
00:53:38,253 --> 00:53:42,290
Speaker 1: And there here's this whole article on every individual.

977
00:53:42,890 --> 00:53:45,070
Speaker 1: The Hunger Games universe has its own page on Wikipedia.

978
00:53:45,753 --> 00:53:45,814
Speaker 1: Yep.

979
00:53:45,834 --> 00:53:46,703
Speaker 1: And I think gigantic.

980
00:53:48,110 --> 00:53:50,370
Speaker 0: I think that, you know, it's like nerds love that world building.

981
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:58,670
Speaker 1: That is the very unique to Panam, forgotten realms and unnamed tracker, jacker, venom absorbing plants.

982
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:01,510
Speaker 1: But I actually has two paragraphs.

983
00:54:02,433 --> 00:54:07,670
Speaker 0: But I think actually world building has a mass appeal and not just a nerd.

984
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:15,490
Speaker 1: Oh, I this we've said this a lot that there is a huge mass appeal for crazy science fiction and world building.

985
00:54:15,892 --> 00:54:22,689
Speaker 1: And yet it seems like the majority of the people who are involved in the media production world are scared to death of both of those.

986
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:23,171
Speaker 0: Yep.

987
00:54:23,853 --> 00:54:29,329
Speaker 0: But then once they get a successful world, then they go apeshit all in there and try to cram as much as they can.

988
00:54:29,530 --> 00:54:29,832
Speaker 1: I know.

989
00:54:29,912 --> 00:54:36,849
Speaker 0: And at the same time here, the fans come in because they can come in with their fan fictions and their fan arts and their fan fans.

990
00:54:40,321 --> 00:54:41,179
Speaker 1: So what's the next book?

991
00:54:41,962 --> 00:54:42,820
Speaker 0: What is the next book?

992
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:43,532
Speaker 1: Have you decided yet?

993
00:54:43,573 --> 00:54:43,960
Speaker 1: We can wait.

994
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:44,784
Speaker 1: I waited before.

995
00:54:44,885 --> 00:54:47,380
Speaker 0: I know, you know, I was debating and such.

996
00:54:47,622 --> 00:54:47,823
Speaker 0: Right.

997
00:54:47,843 --> 00:54:49,900
Speaker 0: I actually recently read Ready Player One.

998
00:54:50,063 --> 00:54:51,020
Speaker 0: I'm not making that the book.

999
00:54:51,101 --> 00:54:51,788
Speaker 0: OK, good.

1000
00:54:51,868 --> 00:54:52,999
Speaker 1: I want to read it, but not now.

1001
00:54:53,080 --> 00:54:53,222
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1002
00:54:53,303 --> 00:54:54,560
Speaker 0: I'm just going to sum that up for you.

1003
00:54:54,660 --> 00:54:55,638
Speaker 0: It's the game, the book.

1004
00:54:56,822 --> 00:55:00,440
Speaker 0: It's a combination of Damon, which we did a book club book on, I think.

1005
00:55:00,803 --> 00:55:01,694
Speaker 0: Right.

1006
00:55:01,714 --> 00:55:02,180
Speaker 0: No, we didn't.

1007
00:55:02,420 --> 00:55:02,804
Speaker 0: I thought we did.

1008
00:55:03,005 --> 00:55:04,539
Speaker 1: We talked about you did a Geek Bite, I think.

1009
00:55:04,821 --> 00:55:06,799
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's a combination of that book and the Woo game.

1010
00:55:07,726 --> 00:55:08,799
Speaker 0: That's Ready Player One.

1011
00:55:09,580 --> 00:55:13,580
Speaker 0: I think, uh, OK, let's just do this book.

1012
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:17,140
Speaker 0: So it's one of those popular things, right?

1013
00:55:17,260 --> 00:55:21,880
Speaker 0: Everyone's always talking about the Haruki Murakami person.

1014
00:55:22,361 --> 00:55:22,642
Speaker 0: Right.

1015
00:55:23,746 --> 00:55:24,910
Speaker 0: And it's like all I see.

1016
00:55:24,991 --> 00:55:32,162
Speaker 0: everywhere is people reading these books and it's sort of like, you know, the crazy popular book that hasn't had the movie yet, or at least not that I know of.

1017
00:55:32,964 --> 00:55:37,720
Speaker 0: So I'm you know, I'm not what the person's written so many books.

1018
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:43,971
Speaker 0: I'm not sure which one is like the starting one, but it seems like the most popular one is the one Q eighty four.

1019
00:55:46,321 --> 00:55:48,518
Speaker 0: So I think we should read it just to see what the deal is.

1020
00:55:50,407 --> 00:55:51,157
Speaker 0: And so let's read that.

1021
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:52,029
Speaker 1: All right.

1022
00:55:52,313 --> 00:55:52,719
Speaker 1: I'm game.

1023
00:55:53,241 --> 00:55:53,785
Speaker 1: I'll kindle it.

1024
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:55,336
Speaker 1: And if I can't kindle it, I'll pirate it.

1025
00:55:55,961 --> 00:55:56,627
Speaker 1: Because I'm done.

1026
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:58,040
Speaker 1: I'm I'm pretty much done.

1027
00:55:58,240 --> 00:55:59,360
Speaker 0: Kindle edition, Kindle edition.

1028
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,309
Speaker 0: Fifteen bucks.

1029
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:01,220
Speaker 1: OK, fine.

1030
00:56:01,640 --> 00:56:03,079
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'm going to pay fifteen bucks.

1031
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,040
Speaker 1: The thing is, I don't hardcover 1798.

1032
00:56:06,040 --> 00:56:07,840
Speaker 1: I don't want a physical thing.

1033
00:56:08,301 --> 00:56:10,312
Speaker 1: I'm only buying from like.

1034
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:11,740
Speaker 1: I don't even want paperbacks anymore.

1035
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:19,160
Speaker 1: I'll buy a hardcover of a book that I'm not only going to read again in the future, but I'm going to reference occasionally and lend to people.

1036
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:20,438
Speaker 0: I'll get paperbacks.

1037
00:56:20,761 --> 00:56:27,680
Speaker 0: But my new strategy is to get them, read them, give them away and get rid of them, let loan them to someone and just never ask for them back or book off or who knows what.

1038
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:28,968
Speaker 1: That's better off giving them.

1039
00:56:29,009 --> 00:56:30,100
Speaker 1: I think you don't get enough money.

1040
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:31,680
Speaker 0: I'm just saying that's my new strategy.

1041
00:56:32,143 --> 00:56:33,859
Speaker 1: I'm actually thinking about doing a book purge.

1042
00:56:34,321 --> 00:56:36,560
Speaker 0: I'm definitely got to do a purge soon because I got too many.

1043
00:56:36,860 --> 00:56:38,200
Speaker 1: I got too many everything I bought.

1044
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:40,739
Speaker 0: So I keep buying comics and I haven't read a lot of them.

1045
00:56:42,382 --> 00:56:44,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, we read those fifty two.

1046
00:56:45,342 --> 00:56:47,158
Speaker 0: We did and I have a stack of fifty two.

1047
00:56:54,092 --> 00:56:56,230
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1048
00:56:56,390 --> 00:57:01,350
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1049
00:57:01,770 --> 00:57:06,813

Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1053
00:57:22,550 --> 00:57:25,390
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
