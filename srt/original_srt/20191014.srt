1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,187
Speaker 1: It's Monday, October 14th, 2019.

2
00:00:10,187 --> 00:00:11,671
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:11,812 --> 00:00:12,835
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,935 --> 00:00:14,700
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,199
Speaker 1: Low power modes in things.

6
00:00:20,201 --> 00:00:21,218
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,560
Speaker 1: So, uh, many of you have heard of the Brave browser.

8
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:30,815
Speaker 1: It's a web browser that if you have not heard of it, don't go look for it.

9
00:00:30,996 --> 00:00:31,518
Speaker 1: Don't use it.

10
00:00:32,561 --> 00:00:43,820
Speaker 1: Uh, I feel like the demographic of person, and some of you might be offended by this, who use the Brave browser, uh, is a fan of Andrew Yang, is really into vaping and bitcoins.

11
00:00:45,204 --> 00:00:45,716
Speaker 0: Probably, yeah.

12
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:51,420
Speaker 1: Like, I feel like that, like, it's the same kind of person who uses DuckDuckGo instead of, like, a regular search engine.

13
00:00:52,581 --> 00:01:02,852
Speaker 1: So, one of the things the Brave browser does, and I'm just telling you this as an anecdote that you can do with what you will, is that it's set up to where it's really easy to make it.

14
00:01:02,973 --> 00:01:04,699
Speaker 1: use Tor for everything you do.

15
00:01:05,462 --> 00:01:14,834
Speaker 1: Like, everything you browse, it'll just do Tor, meaning it basically runs a Tor node, meaning don't fucking install the Brave browser on your desktop at work.

16
00:01:15,135 --> 00:01:16,760
Speaker 1: You're probably gonna get in trouble.

17
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:17,455
Speaker 0: Yep.

18
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,720
Speaker 1: And I'm just gonna warn you all, if you are a punk kid who's into Andrew Yang and bitcoins and vaping.

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,168
Speaker 0: Why are you listening to this show?

20
00:01:25,228 --> 00:01:27,160
Speaker 0: Because we advise against all those things.

21
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:28,626
Speaker 1: How did you find Geek Nights?

22
00:01:28,667 --> 00:01:31,460
Speaker 1: Like, how are you still listening to us?

23
00:01:31,922 --> 00:01:34,720
Speaker 1: You might have figured out that we're not into any of the things you're into.

24
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,247
Speaker 1: But now you can add one more thing to that list.

25
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:49,620
Speaker 1: In my personal opinion, and not really in my professional opinion, because I don't give a shit that much which browser you use, but my personal opinion, it's too soon to use the Brave browser.

26
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,788
Speaker 1: I would not trust the Brave browser.

27
00:01:51,808 --> 00:01:55,040
Speaker 1: I would use Firefox or Chrome or Safari.

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,599
Speaker 1: And honestly, Chrome, less and less as time goes on.

29
00:01:59,121 --> 00:02:00,547
Speaker 1: Chrome's not in a great place right now.

30
00:02:00,567 --> 00:02:03,297
Speaker 1: Has anything happened to you in the last 48 hours?

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:12,216
Speaker 0: Unpacked a lot of stuff because I'm done moving, mostly.

32
00:02:12,236 --> 00:02:13,600
Speaker 0: Not really.

33
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,406
Speaker 1: Alright, because we'll get right into the tech news.

34
00:02:17,028 --> 00:02:20,520
Speaker 1: Biggest tech news, a lot of you have not paid attention to the details of this story.

35
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:33,060
Speaker 0: It's one of those stories where you read the news and I feel like I read the story constantly every once in a while, but it's only because there's a lot of time between things happening because it involves courts.

36
00:02:33,523 --> 00:02:36,300
Speaker 0: So it's like it only pops up in the news and the court does something.

37
00:02:36,842 --> 00:02:39,800
Speaker 0: And then it's like you feel like you're just reading the same thing over and over again.

38
00:02:40,463 --> 00:02:42,719
Speaker 0: And there's hardly any actual new news to it.

39
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:43,301
Speaker 1: Yep.

40
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:53,660
Speaker 1: So the original news way back was Facebook ruined the internet because they falsely pivoted to video with clearly inflated metrics.

41
00:02:53,821 --> 00:02:54,442
Speaker 1: Right.

42
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:56,529
Speaker 0: So to explain it better, right?

43
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,238
Speaker 0: Imagine it's the year, the mid to late 2000s.

44
00:03:00,802 --> 00:03:03,972
Speaker 0: And you're a website and you make videos, right?

45
00:03:04,012 --> 00:03:06,580
Speaker 0: And you put them up on your own website or something, right?

46
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,979
Speaker 0: Like CollegeHumor.

47
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:09,480
Speaker 0: That's like the prime example.

48
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:13,871
Speaker 1: Super successful standalone business with its own hosted videos.

49
00:03:13,931 --> 00:03:15,175
Speaker 1: People are watching those videos.

50
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:15,796
Speaker 1: They're making money.

51
00:03:15,857 --> 00:03:16,458
Speaker 1: They're profitable.

52
00:03:16,518 --> 00:03:16,940
Speaker 1: They're successful.

53
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,202
Speaker 0: And then what happened?

54
00:03:18,282 --> 00:03:19,484
Speaker 0: is Facebook, right?

55
00:03:19,504 --> 00:03:21,487
Speaker 0: They completely lied.

56
00:03:21,547 --> 00:03:29,080
Speaker 0: They made up fake analytics numbers to suggest that videos, when posted on Facebook, get a shit ton of views.

57
00:03:29,421 --> 00:03:34,420
Speaker 0: So you're sitting there thinking, well, I get enough views and I run my show on my own on my own website.

58
00:03:35,121 --> 00:03:42,440
Speaker 0: But if I were to upload my videos to Facebook instead, I would get a fuck ton of views, even more than I'm getting now and make even more money.

59
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,097
Speaker 0: Right?

60
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:48,500
Speaker 1: Now, if you assume that that data is true, that's probably the smart move.

61
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:48,920
Speaker 0: Right.

62
00:03:48,940 --> 00:04:06,040
Speaker 0: You're also, well, not only that, if you're sitting there and you don't even make videos, maybe you got a blog and it's like, oh, hey, if instead of making news articles or blog posts, if I make videos and put them on Facebook instead, because look at those numbers of people watching videos on Facebook, that seems, I'll just kind of convert my whole business.

63
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:13,220
Speaker 0: I'm going to make a video studio, hire video people, fire my writers, fire some of the writers because it's only to write the videos.

64
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:19,399
Speaker 0: But, you know, you start making tons of videos instead of what I was doing before and put them on Facebook instead of my own website.

65
00:04:19,862 --> 00:04:21,779
Speaker 0: And then it turns out those numbers were a lie.

66
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,099
Speaker 0: So there aren't that many people watching the videos on Facebook and you can't make that much money off of it.

67
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:37,360
Speaker 1: So even consider if you're like YouTube, YouTube would look at their own metrics and then see Facebook publishing that they're getting like millions and millions more views on their platform.

68
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,940
Speaker 1: So even Google would have to like react to these numbers.

69
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:46,759
Speaker 1: The numbers were inflated to make a fine point by up to nine hundred percent.

70
00:04:47,485 --> 00:04:47,658
Speaker 0: Yep.

71
00:04:47,941 --> 00:04:50,600
Speaker 1: That is that is fucking disastrous.

72
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:51,101
Speaker 0: Right.

73
00:04:51,141 --> 00:05:02,200
Speaker 0: So the result is that all these businesses, you know, people running websites, making content, articles, videos, whatever, turned over their whole business, making decisions based on data they believed to be true.

74
00:05:02,623 --> 00:05:03,531
Speaker 0: That was fake data.

75
00:05:03,552 --> 00:05:04,380
Speaker 0: They believed to be true.

76
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:14,397
Speaker 0: They made business decisions on false data, resulting in their business basically being ruined in some cases or completely changed or completely, you know, damaged severely.

77
00:05:16,381 --> 00:05:21,420
Speaker 1: I mean, how many podcasts failed because they pivoted to video and then didn't actually get that many views?

78
00:05:21,981 --> 00:05:29,000
Speaker 0: You know, a lot of websites with like, you know, that made content, just like articles switched to making videos, moved over to Facebook.

79
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:29,902
Speaker 0: Right.

80
00:05:30,245 --> 00:05:32,080
Speaker 0: And then no one was going to their website anymore.

81
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:36,280
Speaker 0: But they were like, well, we can abandon that website because no one's going there on this Facebook thing.

82
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,825
Speaker 0: And then no one was on the Facebook either.

83
00:05:37,865 --> 00:05:42,480
Speaker 0: It's like you were in a. you had your store on a good street and someone told you, no, no, no.

84
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,739
Speaker 0: This other street, there's so much foot traffic over there.

85
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,520
Speaker 0: You go, oh, man, I got to move my business.

86
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:47,305
Speaker 0: You move your business.

87
00:05:47,728 --> 00:05:49,077
Speaker 0: There's no foot traffic over there.

88
00:05:50,142 --> 00:05:51,056
Speaker 0: You're a very bad man.

89
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,079
Speaker 0: You're making a suggestion for my business.

90
00:05:55,064 --> 00:05:55,438
Speaker 0: You're wrong.

91
00:05:55,940 --> 00:06:05,000
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, there's a whole bunch of people who are still looking for you on the old street because the old street was making enough money for you to have a normal business continuing to thrive.

92
00:06:05,201 --> 00:06:10,100
Speaker 0: So this happened and people sued Facebook, which is what you do, and that kind of thing happens.

93
00:06:10,543 --> 00:06:12,259
Speaker 0: And they won, which is that kind of thing.

94
00:06:12,661 --> 00:06:13,157
Speaker 0: They were right.

95
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,661
Speaker 1: Yeah.

96
00:06:13,921 --> 00:06:20,774
Speaker 0: But the penalty in court that Facebook suffers for doing this lying, you know, it's like you think about the thing.

97
00:06:20,814 --> 00:06:23,740
Speaker 0: they did seem small, just lying about numbers.

98
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,460
Speaker 0: But the damage caused by that small thing was enormous.

99
00:06:27,103 --> 00:06:29,039
Speaker 0: But the penalty Facebook is paying is what?

100
00:06:30,124 --> 00:06:32,313
Speaker 1: So the penalty is 40 million dollars.

101
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:36,817
Speaker 1: In my opinion, the penalty should be 40 billion.

102
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:38,241
Speaker 0: Right.

103
00:06:38,262 --> 00:06:39,539
Speaker 0: Because it doesn't matter what you did.

104
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:41,300
Speaker 0: It's how much damage you caused.

105
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:41,580
Speaker 0: Right.

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:52,940
Speaker 0: If I, you know, swing my fist and I happen to, like, kill three children and someone else, I don't know, sets off a firework and burns a guy's arm.

107
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:56,560
Speaker 0: It's like, well, setting off the firework is really more severe than just swinging a fist.

108
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,260
Speaker 0: But I killed three children.

109
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:05,660
Speaker 0: So I deserve three children death worth of punishment, whereas firework guy deserves burned a guy arm worth of punishment.

110
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:15,200
Speaker 0: Facebook just lied about some numbers, you know, how many people are watching the videos and they destroyed entire content creation companies across, you know, how many places.

111
00:07:15,741 --> 00:07:20,520
Speaker 1: Like, I know, I know multiple people whose careers were like directly affected by this.

112
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:20,800
Speaker 0: I know.

113
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:27,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know several websites, you know, that people worked at that basically are now gone or shells of their former selves.

114
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:30,659
Speaker 0: And all those people are now working at different places, doing different things.

115
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

116
00:07:31,841 --> 00:07:43,160
Speaker 1: So, uh, honestly, the only solution at this point, and this is partly why it says formally endorsed Elizabeth Warren for the Democratic primary for president, is that I think Facebook should be fucking broken up.

117
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:43,705
Speaker 1: Yeah.

118
00:07:43,766 --> 00:07:44,800
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of companies should.

119
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,779
Speaker 1: But Facebook should be broken up irrespective of this.

120
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:49,499
Speaker 0: Google, Microsoft, Apple.

121
00:07:50,343 --> 00:07:55,680
Speaker 1: And simultaneously, probably destroyed by being forced to pay for the real damage it caused.

122
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:01,700
Speaker 0: I mean, if I'm driving my car and I know that's and this is only one instance of Facebook causing damage.

123
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,760
Speaker 0: We should really just take all of Zuckerberg's money and all of Facebook's money.

124
00:08:06,261 --> 00:08:06,522
Speaker 0: Right.

125
00:08:06,602 --> 00:08:11,479
Speaker 0: And all of its and all the shareholders, anyone who owns stock, take the value of those shares from them.

126
00:08:11,961 --> 00:08:12,101
Speaker 0: Right.

127
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:18,900
Speaker 0: Basically take all of its worth entirely instantly and give it back to not only the people who are directly dead.

128
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:23,340
Speaker 1: But how many people lost parents to becoming like crazy conservative nut jobs because of Facebook?

129
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:28,020
Speaker 0: How many people, how many parents lost children who killed themselves because of bullying on Facebook?

130
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:34,559
Speaker 0: How many, literally every single bad thing that was caused by Facebook, people should be able to submit and get paid.

131
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,240
Speaker 0: And also, our entire society should be paid back for the damage that Facebook has caused in general.

132
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:44,700
Speaker 0: How many people lost, if you lost like a year of your life playing Farmville, Facebook should have to pay for that too.

133
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:45,740
Speaker 1: I think Farmville was unethical.

134
00:08:46,584 --> 00:08:49,660
Speaker 1: Now, before you say, but what about all the other companies that do similar things?

135
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:51,208
Speaker 1: One at a time.

136
00:08:51,573 --> 00:08:52,200
Speaker 1: Pick your battles.

137
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:55,420
Speaker 1: Facebook is the most egregious offender here.

138
00:08:55,820 --> 00:09:02,559
Speaker 1: And honestly, destroying Facebook would solve a lot of the short term problems our society is having right now.

139
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,080
Speaker 1: Because, well, that's a topic for another time.

140
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,700
Speaker 0: Lost your job because it's on Facebook?

141
00:09:08,844 --> 00:09:08,931
Speaker 0: Yeah.

142
00:09:10,401 --> 00:09:14,760
Speaker 1: So in some other news, and this is a really good idea, I'm actually really happy about this.

143
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,420
Speaker 1: And I think other cities need to do the same.

144
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:36,140
Speaker 1: San Francisco, the city in the US, is looking to basically pass a law saying that if you want to roll out some technology, I'll get back to what technology means in a second, using public streets or public infrastructure in any way, you need to go to a new office in the city called the Office of Emerging Technology and apply for a permit.

145
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:51,620
Speaker 1: And the permit will either say, yes, you have one year to deploy your technology, and then we will review it to see if it has detrimentally impacted the livelihood and lives of the people in the city, and then either let you continue deploying that technology or ban you from the city.

146
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:58,420
Speaker 1: And the focus of this is to prevent companies like Lime from putting those terrible scooters all over and ruining everything.

147
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:02,380
Speaker 0: Right, so the thing is with the scooters, I don't hate the scooter itself.

148
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:06,500
Speaker 0: It's like anyone using a non-car to get around, that's fucking great.

149
00:10:07,162 --> 00:10:12,660
Speaker 0: And it's like, okay, you're renting it from some sort of Silicon Valley business.

150
00:10:13,242 --> 00:10:16,020
Speaker 0: I would rather you just buy a scooter and own it, right?

151
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:18,620
Speaker 0: So it's not the best, but it's like, that's okay.

152
00:10:18,941 --> 00:10:21,620
Speaker 0: There's like the Revell electro-scooter thing.

153
00:10:22,161 --> 00:10:23,440
Speaker 0: It's like that's actually kind of okay.

154
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,669
Speaker 1: I was actually looking at those.

155
00:10:24,709 --> 00:10:25,819
Speaker 1: I wanted to see how expensive they were.

156
00:10:26,281 --> 00:10:28,040
Speaker 0: Not that bad, considering what you get.

157
00:10:28,441 --> 00:10:36,139
Speaker 0: But I don't mind that as much because it's going, they're parking them in parking spaces, which shouldn't exist in the first place, but they're there.

158
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:42,700
Speaker 0: The problem I have with the scooter is that they're just dumping them on the sidewalk, right?

159
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:43,960
Speaker 0: This is one of those problems.

160
00:10:44,141 --> 00:10:44,494
Speaker 0: I'm walking here.

161
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,180
Speaker 1: This is an affordance problem, the UX problem.

162
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:48,084
Speaker 1: Affordances are.

163
00:10:48,306 --> 00:10:49,011
Speaker 1: you have a thing.

164
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:50,420
Speaker 1: It's intended for a purpose.

165
00:10:50,781 --> 00:10:58,840
Speaker 1: But by the intrinsic nature of that thing, it affords other types of behaviors that you either don't care about or you actively don't want someone to do.

166
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:03,740
Speaker 1: It basically means you intended X, someone figures out they can use it for Y. That's effectively what that means.

167
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,340
Speaker 0: Right, so imagine if I had a business and my business was like hammock rental, come take a nap, right?

168
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,400
Speaker 0: So if I got my own land with my own trees and my own hammocks and you come and you pay some money and sleep in a hammock, that's all great.

169
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:21,120
Speaker 0: If I just go into Central Park and set up some hammocks, even if I set them up in a friendly way that is not damaging trees, right?

170
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:25,175
Speaker 0: It's like if I'm selling sleeps in those hammocks, that's fucking public land.

171
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:26,460
Speaker 0: You can't be doing that shit here.

172
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,338
Speaker 0: So you can't be parking your fucking scooters and running your business off the sidewalk.

173
00:11:32,881 --> 00:11:35,840
Speaker 0: A street cart that sells food off the sidewalk has a permit.

174
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:43,220
Speaker 1: The affordance of a dockless scooter or dockless bicycle as opposed to a docked scooter or bicycle is that you can park it anywhere.

175
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,020
Speaker 0: Well, you can just drop a dock somewhere, right?

176
00:11:47,343 --> 00:11:52,780
Speaker 1: But while you can drop a dock somewhere, the problem is not necessarily the fact that it's dockless versus docked.

177
00:11:53,581 --> 00:12:01,720
Speaker 1: The problem is specifically that the average user of these things is basically the common clay of the New West and they don't give a shit where they leave the scooter.

178
00:12:02,322 --> 00:12:07,300
Speaker 1: And there's no reason for them, too, because there is no consequence to them if they leave the scooter somewhere stupid.

179
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,989
Speaker 0: Right, if you got a city bike, it's like.

180
00:12:10,050 --> 00:12:12,740
Speaker 0: regardless of the fact that a city bike is a city thing...

181
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:15,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I don't bring it back to the dock, I'm out like five grand.

182
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,228
Speaker 0: Well, I'm just saying there's a contract with the city to put the docks.

183
00:12:18,289 --> 00:12:21,600
Speaker 0: It's not just they dump the dock there of their own without asking anyone, right?

184
00:12:21,620 --> 00:12:26,560
Speaker 0: But also, yeah, if you lose a city bike and you don't re-dock it, you're out twelve hundred bucks.

185
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,379
Speaker 1: I thought it was a lot more than that originally.

186
00:12:28,801 --> 00:12:35,198
Speaker 0: But the point is, a lot of people lose theirs or people go in to get a coffee, come out and it's gone and they're like, "Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

187
00:12:35,219 --> 00:12:35,339
Speaker 0: fuck!".

188
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,932
Speaker 0: And they go on Reddit and they're like, "Oh no, my city!

189
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:39,877
Speaker 0: Anyone seen the city bike?

190
00:12:39,978 --> 00:12:40,038
Speaker 0: Oh

191
00:12:40,058 --> 00:12:40,219
Speaker 0: shit!".

192
00:12:40,561 --> 00:12:46,500
Speaker 1: Earlier this summer, I saw someone steal a city bike and I saw this dude freak out and start chasing after him.

193
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,210
Speaker 0: I saw a dude grab a city bike, get on a ferry.

194
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:52,536
Speaker 0: The city bike docks at both ends of the ferry.

195
00:12:52,556 --> 00:12:53,860
Speaker 0: There's no reason to bring one on the ferry.

196
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:58,600
Speaker 0: And then when he got off the ferry, he forgot it and was running back to the ferry to go get it.

197
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:03,091
Speaker 1: Dude, I saw two people with city bikes at Sandy Hook Beach.

198
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:06,860
Speaker 1: I don't think they understand how much money they were going to owe at the end of the day.

199
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,985
Speaker 0: No, I've seen people bring it on to Roosevelt Island.

200
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:11,493
Speaker 0: It's like, there's no docks on Roosevelt Island.

201
00:13:11,513 --> 00:13:13,740
Speaker 0: You'd have to bike off the island pretty quick.

202
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:15,802
Speaker 0: Remember that time, anyway.

203
00:13:15,822 --> 00:13:21,136
Speaker 0: But yeah, you can just literally just get off the scooter and just plop it anywhere.

204
00:13:21,156 --> 00:13:22,720
Speaker 0: You can just leave it in a Starbucks.

205
00:13:23,242 --> 00:13:27,780
Speaker 1: So, the important thing, if you read this article, because it goes into depth, I don't want to get into in the news right now.

206
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:40,980
Speaker 1: But this, what San Francisco is proposing, is a very, very intelligent way to handle, to balance the needs of, one, we want to innovate in making the lives of people in urban areas better.

207
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,287
Speaker 1: Like, better infrastructure.

208
00:13:43,568 --> 00:13:44,392
Speaker 1: And we want to innovate.

209
00:13:44,412 --> 00:13:46,100
Speaker 1: We want to try out modern technology.

210
00:13:46,441 --> 00:13:54,840
Speaker 1: But at the same time, we want the government to be able to regulate, control, and plan that technology in a way that does not have negative and unanticipated consequences.

211
00:13:55,320 --> 00:14:01,460
Speaker 1: And this law seems to specifically attempt to balance that in a very nuanced and intelligent way.

212
00:14:02,261 --> 00:14:06,900
Speaker 1: I am really invested in how this law might go, and I encourage you to read this article.

213
00:14:08,522 --> 00:14:14,540
Speaker 1: In some other brief news, you know, we often talk about how we don't talk a lot about tech news, because most tech news is dry as shit.

214
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:20,400
Speaker 1: So, I wanted to talk about some actual tech news, so you can be reminded why we don't talk about this stuff on Geek Nights.

215
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:22,303
Speaker 1: AMP.

216
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:23,858
Speaker 1: You even know what that is?

217
00:14:24,441 --> 00:14:27,760
Speaker 0: It's like Active Mobile Pages or something like that?

218
00:14:27,982 --> 00:14:28,679
Speaker 1: I always forget about it.

219
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,143
Speaker 0: I know what it is.

220
00:14:29,163 --> 00:14:30,292
Speaker 0: I forgot what the acronym stands for.

221
00:14:30,312 --> 00:14:31,340
Speaker 0: It's definitely Mobile something.

222
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically it's like a mobile accelerator technology.

223
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:45,220
Speaker 0: Basically, all it is is Google says, hey, if you make your mobile site use this subset of HTML and JavaScript, just keep your website real simple and within these constraints, right?

224
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:52,520
Speaker 0: Then we'll be able to like, you know, cash your like super cash your content and like load it.

225
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:55,848
Speaker 0: They were doing stuff like loading it directly off of Google.

226
00:14:55,868 --> 00:15:00,740
Speaker 0: Like you'd be on Google, you do a Google search, you click a link, your website loads straight from Google.

227
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:06,220
Speaker 0: People don't even go to your website because your content has been cashed on there or you make browsing super fast.

228
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:14,840
Speaker 0: Basically, Google would give you all the love if you made a super fast mobile site by just constraining yourself to this subset of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

229
00:15:15,143 --> 00:15:16,740
Speaker 1: I know we've already lost a lot of you here.

230
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

231
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:21,256
Speaker 1: So this is a Google proprietary thing effectively.

232
00:15:21,296 --> 00:15:22,180
Speaker 1: Like it's a Google thing.

233
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:22,612
Speaker 0: Yep.

234
00:15:22,881 --> 00:15:23,635
Speaker 1: So it is now...

235
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,374
Speaker 0: It's not a W3C thing.

236
00:15:25,414 --> 00:15:26,040
Speaker 0: It's a Google thing.

237
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:33,800
Speaker 1: So it is now joining the OpenJS Foundation, which is the Linux Foundation based group that launched last year.

238
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:39,880
Speaker 1: I was quoting Facebook after the merger of Node.js and the JS Foundation or JavaScript Foundation.

239
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:44,300
Speaker 0: All these foundations are where companies send their technology that they don't want to maintain anymore.

240
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:44,680
Speaker 1: Yep.

241
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:53,000
Speaker 1: So the OpenJS Foundation that now will also manage AMP is responsible for jQuery, Node.js and Webpack.

242
00:15:54,672 --> 00:15:55,700
Speaker 1: None of you probably care.

243
00:15:56,561 --> 00:15:58,659
Speaker 1: And there's very little interesting to say about this.

244
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:08,520
Speaker 1: But the one thing I can say is that I feel like we're on the cusp of a major radical reorganization of how open source software gets built and maintained.

245
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:15,900
Speaker 1: Because the reality is a lot of large companies increasingly rely on a very small number of very important open source packages.

246
00:16:16,021 --> 00:16:17,507
Speaker 1: And the funding model around.

247
00:16:17,547 --> 00:16:20,480
Speaker 1: that is increasingly difficult to understand and maintain.

248
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:31,160
Speaker 1: And it is very difficult in this modern late capitalist hellscape to work out open source software seriously for actual free and still survive.

249
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:38,780
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the Linux kernel model, which, you know, the foundation model seems to have worked and continue to work, right?

250
00:16:38,881 --> 00:16:41,660
Speaker 0: As long as you still get people to work on the thing, right?

251
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:46,459
Speaker 0: The Linux kernel, the way it works is they have a foundation and it pays people to work on it.

252
00:16:46,941 --> 00:16:58,560
Speaker 0: But there are also lots of people who work at, say, Intel, Nvidia, AMD, all these other places that need mostly hardware-y places.

253
00:16:59,202 --> 00:17:01,172
Speaker 0: And they need their shit to work with Linux.

254
00:17:01,252 --> 00:17:02,840
Speaker 0: They need Linux kernel to run with their hardware.

255
00:17:03,401 --> 00:17:09,420
Speaker 0: So they're always sending in patches, even though they're Nvidia, IBM employees, whatever employees.

256
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,079
Speaker 0: Red Hat employees, they're all sending in kernel patches.

257
00:17:13,582 --> 00:17:18,280
Speaker 0: So if you've got a situation like this, you know, the AMP goes over to this foundation, right?

258
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:26,280
Speaker 0: Someone over at the foundation is being paid by the foundation's donations, which could come from Google, individuals, who knows, right?

259
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:30,300
Speaker 0: Companies that rely on that software will donate money to pay those people.

260
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:38,520
Speaker 0: But then full time employees at the companies will also send in patches for the people at the foundation to, you know, manage and whatever.

261
00:17:38,823 --> 00:17:39,872
Speaker 0: That's what that model is.

262
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:40,659
Speaker 0: And it's worked.

263
00:17:42,262 --> 00:17:42,442
Speaker 1: Yep.

264
00:17:42,845 --> 00:17:45,840
Speaker 1: I don't have much more to say about it because this space is kind of complicated.

265
00:17:46,361 --> 00:17:49,673
Speaker 0: But the AMP thing is like it would take like a whole show.

266
00:17:49,693 --> 00:17:51,460
Speaker 0: I guess that would be as a Monday show idea.

267
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,765
Speaker 0: Yeah.

268
00:17:53,268 --> 00:17:55,760
Speaker 0: I feel like we've talked about it before, though, on Monday.

269
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,563
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's like a whole drama.

270
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:06,460
Speaker 0: ever since Google started it, especially the mostly surrounding the aspect of Google hosting your content, people not actually visiting your website stuff.

271
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:06,982
Speaker 0: Yeah.

272
00:18:07,845 --> 00:18:11,580
Speaker 0: Which, well, I mean, there have been a lot of changes there.

273
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:19,240
Speaker 1: There's a tweet that makes the rounds periodically and it's just a few words and it sort of sums up one of the fundamental problems of the modern Internet.

274
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,829
Speaker 1: And I quote, I don't even know who said it first.

275
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:24,460
Speaker 1: I feel like there used to be more websites.

276
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,146
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

277
00:18:35,206 --> 00:18:37,233
Speaker 1: So I had a thing of the day that I wanted to use.

278
00:18:37,514 --> 00:18:39,140
Speaker 1: that was about ports of coin ops.

279
00:18:39,582 --> 00:18:41,689
Speaker 1: But I can't find it anymore.

280
00:18:41,709 --> 00:18:44,600
Speaker 1: And I can find all these similar articles that aren't as good.

281
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:50,980
Speaker 1: So instead, I'm using a thing of the day that both expresses my feelings about the fact that I can't find the original thing of the day.

282
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,510
Speaker 1: And I also find extremely amusing personally.

283
00:18:54,931 --> 00:18:55,553
Speaker 1: Just watch it.

284
00:18:55,653 --> 00:18:57,740
Speaker 1: It is a four second video on a tweet.

285
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:02,780
Speaker 0: I think this is a self referential thing of the day because it is such a meh thing of the day.

286
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:03,595
Speaker 1: I think it's delightful.

287
00:19:06,063 --> 00:19:10,380
Speaker 0: If you announce this is my thing of the day, you could use this as a response to that statement.

288
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:14,140
Speaker 1: But I think it is a really good thing of the day because comedically it's perfectly timed.

289
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:17,733
Speaker 1: You don't see the sword until the final sound.

290
00:19:18,455 --> 00:19:19,660
Speaker 1: It's comedically timed very well.

291
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:26,980
Speaker 1: And if you don't recognize what that sound is, I weep for you because you missed out on a cultural touchstone.

292
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:35,520
Speaker 0: Anyway, so way back in the day when you're a kid, you go to pediatrician's office, maybe a dentist's office, and there's two things you're always going to find in that office.

293
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,168
Speaker 1: Oh, there's the wires with the balls.

294
00:19:37,671 --> 00:19:39,480
Speaker 0: There's a toy, which is basically a table.

295
00:19:39,921 --> 00:19:49,040
Speaker 0: And in the table are a bunch of wires that have both ends of the metal metal wires, kind of thick gauge with both ends stuck into the wood and twisted into a crazy shape.

296
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:56,960
Speaker 0: And on those wires, the assortment of them are like various wooden objects with holes poked in them that slide back and forth across the wires.

297
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:01,560
Speaker 0: If you just search on Google for like doctor's office toy, you will see that toy.

298
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:05,920
Speaker 1: To this day, if I saw one of those, like if one were in this room, I think I would fuck with it for a little bit.

299
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:11,718
Speaker 0: Well, I'm just saying is that I'm pretty sure what I get, the feeling I get, I have no evidence for this, is that someone invented that toy, right?

300
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:15,440
Speaker 0: And then no one's going to buy the toy for the fucking house, right?

301
00:20:16,403 --> 00:20:18,140
Speaker 1: I mean, it doesn't have that much replay value.

302
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:26,658
Speaker 0: I feel I feel like whoever made that toy, whoever came up with it, went around specifically to doctors, dentist office, pediatrician offices, right?

303
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:32,040
Speaker 0: Pediatric dentist offices and was like, get this toy for your waiting room or marketing it to you.

304
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,347
Speaker 0: Look, you don't even to clean it up.

305
00:20:33,387 --> 00:20:35,720
Speaker 0: It doesn't get a mess everywhere, like blocks or anything.

306
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,300
Speaker 1: I'm sure it's covered in fecal coliform.

307
00:20:37,641 --> 00:20:37,982
Speaker 0: But it's like.

308
00:20:38,022 --> 00:20:39,749
Speaker 0: this is the perfect toy for your office.

309
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,380
Speaker 0: It's you know, it makes your office look really attractive.

310
00:20:42,821 --> 00:20:45,179
Speaker 1: If you don't know what we're talking about, I weep for you.

311
00:20:45,521 --> 00:20:49,176
Speaker 0: I mean, it could be an American thing, I don't know, but just Google for doctor's office toy.

312
00:20:49,196 --> 00:20:50,020
Speaker 0: You'll see you'll know what it is.

313
00:20:50,461 --> 00:20:55,000
Speaker 0: The other toy that I always only had in doctor's office, not at home, though this was a toy you could get at home.

314
00:20:55,827 --> 00:20:57,040
Speaker 1: One, I had those toys at home.

315
00:20:58,025 --> 00:20:59,200
Speaker 1: And two, they're not cheap.

316
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,269
Speaker 0: No, they're not cheap at all.

317
00:21:00,289 --> 00:21:01,220
Speaker 0: That's why we didn't have one.

318
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:04,474
Speaker 0: Is the model train that is not electric.

319
00:21:04,494 --> 00:21:05,720
Speaker 0: It's just wooden tracks.

320
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:08,260
Speaker 1: Specifically the Thomas the Tank Engine one.

321
00:21:08,380 --> 00:21:09,499
Speaker 0: Well, there were generic ones.

322
00:21:09,861 --> 00:21:13,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm saying the Thomas the Tank Engine one was the premium offering.

323
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:19,120
Speaker 0: Sure, but it was wooden tracks and you had hills and tunnels and bridges and all kinds of everything, right?

324
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,620
Speaker 0: Turns, everything.

325
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:27,340
Speaker 0: But the tracks are only wooden with two grooves and the trains themselves would just, you just push them and they rolled.

326
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,340
Speaker 0: They used magnets to connect the cars together.

327
00:21:29,981 --> 00:21:34,094
Speaker 0: But you could also get ones that were sort of like, you know, pull the train back and let go.

328
00:21:34,174 --> 00:21:35,138
Speaker 0: kind of situation, right?

329
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,740
Speaker 0: Where the train goes up by itself a little bit.

330
00:21:37,941 --> 00:21:39,640
Speaker 0: You don't just have to push it with your own force.

331
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,639
Speaker 0: I only saw those a couple times.

332
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:45,800
Speaker 1: But this specific one in your video I had as a kid, it was not cheap.

333
00:21:46,002 --> 00:21:47,680
Speaker 1: And it was, my brother was obsessed with Thomas the Tank Engine.

334
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,680
Speaker 0: Was it powered in any way or just human powered?

335
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:50,779
Speaker 1: No, it's the one from this video.

336
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:51,871
Speaker 0: Alright, just human powered.

337
00:21:51,891 --> 00:21:52,359
Speaker 0: You just push it?

338
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,320
Speaker 1: Yep, just push it around.

339
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:59,360
Speaker 0: Anyway, so yeah, in this video, someone has this old wooden train set that I used to only see in doctor's offices.

340
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,919
Speaker 1: Plus, it had like a bunch of magnets and stuff.

341
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, the magnets sort of, like I said, to connect the cars together.

342
00:22:05,143 --> 00:22:11,100
Speaker 0: And they got the Thomas the Tank Engine cars and they do mad tricks with those cars.

343
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:13,800
Speaker 0: Like, whoa, like better than Hot Wheels tricks.

344
00:22:14,941 --> 00:22:17,920
Speaker 0: And someone has taken that original video with the tricks.

345
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,760
Speaker 0: We're going to link to the original trick video because we're pretty sure that won't be taken down off YouTube.

346
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:29,680
Speaker 0: But someone has replaced the overlay music in the video with some copyrighted music that resulted in my original link getting taken down.

347
00:22:32,644 --> 00:22:33,860
Speaker 0: Excellent musical choices.

348
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:43,180
Speaker 0: So if the thing of the day link is down for copyright violation, just search for Thomas the Tank Engine tricks Biggie Smalls.

349
00:22:44,541 --> 00:22:47,140
Speaker 0: And you'll find, hopefully find a re-upload.

350
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:51,680
Speaker 0: If not, at least you can see the tricks and play the music on your own in Spotify or something.

351
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:55,680
Speaker 1: So, uh, in the meantime, the Geek Does Book Club book is The Tale of Genji.

352
00:22:56,401 --> 00:23:00,020
Speaker 1: Over the course of the holidays, I'm pretty sure we will finish this book over the holidays.

353
00:23:00,501 --> 00:23:02,459
Speaker 0: Uh, I bet no.

354
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,560
Speaker 1: Alright, pretty sure we'll finish this book by...

355
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,919
Speaker 0: When did I select this book?

356
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,990
Speaker 1: You, when did you select this book?

357
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:10,419
Speaker 1: I will click on the link to this.

358
00:23:11,361 --> 00:23:13,794
Speaker 1: Our website does not show the date that you selected this book.

359
00:23:13,814 --> 00:23:14,980
Speaker 1: You are safe from shame.

360
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:15,429
Speaker 0: Okay.

361
00:23:16,741 --> 00:23:18,353
Speaker 1: Anyway, we are reading The Tale of Genji.

362
00:23:18,433 --> 00:23:19,280
Speaker 1: Read it along with us.

363
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,720
Speaker 1: It's the first novel, so I feel like we should talk about it on the Geek Does Book Club.

364
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,380
Speaker 1: I will make a solemn oath to you, because I get to pick the next book.

365
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:32,800
Speaker 1: I will pick something very short, and something that is not a Dungeons and Dragons licensed property.

366
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:34,677
Speaker 1: I make this oath to you.

367
00:23:36,781 --> 00:23:40,260
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we will be live at PAX Unplugged doing two events.

368
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:43,080
Speaker 1: We will be doing Learn and Play and Win.

369
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:45,212
Speaker 1: Uh, I forget what time we're gonna do it.

370
00:23:45,232 --> 00:23:45,778
Speaker 1: I gotta look that up.

371
00:23:46,321 --> 00:23:48,640
Speaker 1: Uh, and it'll be a workshop where we teach you a bunch of games.

372
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:53,980
Speaker 1: And then we will also be doing a panel, a brand new one called Play Your Fucking Turn.

373
00:23:55,063 --> 00:23:55,909
Speaker 1: Uh, it's gonna be great.

374
00:23:56,009 --> 00:23:57,460
Speaker 1: I'm really looking forward to this panel.

375
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,480
Speaker 1: It's brand new, putting some slides together, doing some research.

376
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:07,540
Speaker 1: We're doing, uh, not the most research we've ever done for a panel, but this might be like the third most research we've ever done.

377
00:24:08,202 --> 00:24:09,499
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm pretty excited about this one.

378
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:17,000
Speaker 1: Uh, also, stay tuned for some PAX Unplugged, or PAX South announcements, and some MAGFest announcements, maybe some Zenkai Count announcements.

379
00:24:17,804 --> 00:24:18,990
Speaker 1: Uh, a lot of stuff is coming.

380
00:24:19,311 --> 00:24:21,060
Speaker 1: This is coming up on the Geek Nights busy season.

381
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:21,664
Speaker 0: Okay, okay.

382
00:24:21,745 --> 00:24:22,452
Speaker 0: It's only been 95 days.

383
00:24:23,701 --> 00:24:23,804
Speaker 0: Okay.

384
00:24:24,071 --> 00:24:25,459
Speaker 0: How many- Since we announced that book club.

385
00:24:25,860 --> 00:24:28,500
Speaker 1: So, we're averaging a chapter per hundred days?

386
00:24:28,881 --> 00:24:30,959
Speaker 1: It's, yeah, uh- That's how we're going?

387
00:24:31,341 --> 00:24:32,877
Speaker 0: That is currently the rate abouts.

388
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,023
Speaker 1: Alright, alright.

389
00:24:34,324 --> 00:24:38,620
Speaker 1: Uh, that's, uh, I feel like I might, maybe I should just read some Dumas on the way.

390
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:40,879
Speaker 0: Maybe.

391
00:24:42,162 --> 00:24:43,459
Speaker 1: Alright, let's get right into it.

392
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:53,720
Speaker 1: So, this is a topic that I'm a little annoyed about, because, uh, it stopped working on fully 50% of the devices I own over the past six months.

393
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,300
Speaker 0: So, I have an HDPC, right?

394
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,705
Speaker 0: So, you have an HDPC.

395
00:24:56,765 --> 00:25:03,160
Speaker 0: The thing you kind of want to do with an HDPC, right, is turn it on without being near it, because you sit on the couch.

396
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,320
Speaker 0: You want to turn on the computer when you're on the couch.

397
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,400
Speaker 0: You don't want to get up and push the button on the computer.

398
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,460
Speaker 0: That's why TVs aren't real controls, right?

399
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:09,610
Speaker 1: Yeah.

400
00:25:10,001 --> 00:25:14,380
Speaker 0: So, you gotta understand how a computer goes to sleep.

401
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:14,830
Speaker 1: Yep.

402
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:15,241
Speaker 1: Right?

403
00:25:15,462 --> 00:25:21,120
Speaker 0: If you shut down a computer, right, and you cut power, that is called, there's these sleep states, right?

404
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:28,999
Speaker 0: That is called either just off, or sleep five, which is soft off, which is basically the same fucking thing as off.

405
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,460
Speaker 1: Now, we're only going to talk about relatively modern computers.

406
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,419
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about, like, how this worked on old ancient stuff.

407
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:36,640
Speaker 0: No, only new, only current modern computers, right?

408
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:36,727
Speaker 0: Yeah.

409
00:25:37,242 --> 00:25:48,500
Speaker 0: And to turn the computer on from those states of sleeping, right, and soft off, sleep five, almost everything in the computer has had its power cut to it, except for the power switch, right?

410
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:52,953
Speaker 0: There's two lines on the power supply, obviously, that are still running electricity.

411
00:25:52,993 --> 00:25:57,400
Speaker 0: Computers aren't electricity, and those are basically powering the power switch, and not much else, right?

412
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:06,139
Speaker 0: And soft off, there's a few other things that are still powered that allow the computer to maybe be turned on, like sometimes the LAN, so you can wake on LAN.

413
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:10,180
Speaker 1: Well, ACPI actually does not define nearly as much as I thought it did.

414
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:10,920
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

415
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:13,360
Speaker 0: Good lord, that's why this all sucks.

416
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:16,820
Speaker 0: It's part of why it sucks, and every motherboard in OS is a big pain in the ass.

417
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:19,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's like sleep five, right?

418
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,640
Speaker 0: The most sleep, or even completely off.

419
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:31,539
Speaker 1: So technically, sleep five, just so we sound smart, I'm looking up documentation, sleep five is also G2, which is considered soft off.

420
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:35,620
Speaker 1: There is a deeper one that's called mechanical off that is completely separate.

421
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:36,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

422
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:40,100
Speaker 1: The computer's power has been totally removed via a mechanical switch.

423
00:26:40,862 --> 00:26:45,480
Speaker 0: Right, so you gotta turn the computer on with the button, if your computer's fucking off, right?

424
00:26:46,141 --> 00:26:48,979
Speaker 0: So, obviously, you want to be able to turn the computer off off.

425
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:52,960
Speaker 1: No, no, no, mechanical off requires two buttons to be pressed to turn it back on.

426
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,480
Speaker 1: Power supply switch, then on button.

427
00:26:55,803 --> 00:26:56,439
Speaker 0: Sure, right.

428
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:04,360
Speaker 1: Soft off, the power supply is still on and drawing a current, and powering elements of the motherboard, but the computer itself is otherwise not operating.

429
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:06,180
Speaker 1: That's the only way the power button could work.

430
00:27:07,021 --> 00:27:09,280
Speaker 0: That's what I said, the power button is the only thing that's powered.

431
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:12,740
Speaker 1: But the power button on the front of the computer, as opposed to the other power button.

432
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:24,280
Speaker 0: Yes, if you turn the power supply itself off, then nothing in the computer is receiving power, even from the power supply, except the power supply is getting power from the wall, but that doesn't mean anything, it's not actually drawing power from the wall.

433
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:28,980
Speaker 0: And if you turn your lights off, it's like, well, they're not drawing power from the wall, even though they're plugged into it.

434
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,078
Speaker 1: But the switch could still work.

435
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:37,600
Speaker 1: So I guess the analogy that's not quite accurate, but is close enough, would be if you went and then turned off the breaker, so the switch can't even work.

436
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:42,320
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the next level of off on a computer is S4, which is hibernation.

437
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:49,340
Speaker 0: So what happens in hibernation, right, is that your computer takes everything in RAM, and it puts it on storage.

438
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:54,419
Speaker 0: Usually on Windows, it makes a file on your file system called like "HiberFile.sys" or something like that.

439
00:27:54,901 --> 00:27:58,180
Speaker 0: It literally is a file that contains the contents of RAM, exactly.

440
00:27:58,761 --> 00:28:10,279
Speaker 1: Because think about it, all your computer is, is a bunch of storage that's non-volatile, meaning it'll remember stuff, and storage that's volatile, meaning it only remembers it as long as you are constantly feeding a huge amount of power.

441
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:21,740
Speaker 0: Right, because when your computer goes off off, well, the way RAM works, the way your CPU works, is everything, all the memory in the RAM and CPU will just be erased, because they need electricity to hold that data in memory.

442
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:29,945
Speaker 0: But your hard drives, or magnets, or SSDs, or whatever the hell they are, right, and it's like, those don't lose their memory, so you just

443
00:28:30,347 --> 00:28:31,253
Speaker 1: copy all the RAM

444
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:49,740
Speaker 0: and all the registers and the CPU and everything to the disk, and then turn off and hibernate, and now, the computer's kind of mostly off off, it's not too different from when it's, you know, S5, but someone comes along and pushes the power button, and the computer will copy everything that's on that file on the hard drive.

445
00:28:49,820 --> 00:29:11,200
Speaker 0: when it's booting into RAM, and it turns on way faster, and your computer, even though it was off off, suddenly it's like, it's just where you left off using it, your browser's open, it's all the same web pages you were looking at, your game is still running, as long as it wasn't a multiplayer game, it's like, oh, it doesn't feel like I turned it off, it's exactly where I left things, oh, that's interesting.

446
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:21,520
Speaker 1: Now, a sort of modern caveat to that is that, most of the reason people wanted to hibernate computers in the old days, is that they'd have very long running desktop applications.

447
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:27,720
Speaker 1: they wanted to leave on, usually because computers took forever to boot, and applications took forever to start.

448
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:38,979
Speaker 1: My current computer boots faster than I can react, but if it's hibernating, and I wake it up from hibernation, that actually takes longer than just booting.

449
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:39,411
Speaker 0: Depends.

450
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:42,074
Speaker 1: Depends on how much I had open in RAM.

451
00:29:42,094 --> 00:29:42,960
Speaker 1: I get a lot of RAM.

452
00:29:43,920 --> 00:29:46,300
Speaker 0: Okay, so the next level we have is sleeping.

453
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:49,040
Speaker 0: Now, sleeping is the thing I had a problem with lately, right?

454
00:29:50,502 --> 00:29:52,130
Speaker 1: I, too, have a problem with it lately.

455
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:54,339
Speaker 1: S3 and S4 both fail on my computer now.

456
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:55,423
Speaker 0: Oh, and S4?

457
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:58,160
Speaker 0: For me, I got different issues.

458
00:29:59,162 --> 00:30:06,700
Speaker 1: If I get below S2, my computer basically can't wake up again, and I'm pretty sure it's a Windows update that caused a specific problem.

459
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,600
Speaker 0: I got a different problem.

460
00:30:08,001 --> 00:30:08,960
Speaker 1: This is a recent problem.

461
00:30:09,662 --> 00:30:12,660
Speaker 0: Mine is a longer running problem, but I didn't try to fix it until recently.

462
00:30:13,121 --> 00:30:18,213
Speaker 0: Anyway, S1, S2, S3 are all asleep, but modern computers don't use one or two.

463
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:22,619
Speaker 0: It's basically only three.

464
00:30:24,143 --> 00:30:28,818
Speaker 1: Or if they do things that are effectively what S1 or S2 would do, you don't need to know about it.

465
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:35,240
Speaker 1: This is where it gets complicated because the devices in your computer can have their own independent power saving features.

466
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,500
Speaker 0: Right, we'll talk about those things later.

467
00:30:37,723 --> 00:30:40,240
Speaker 0: S3 is sleeping for all intents and purposes.

468
00:30:41,065 --> 00:30:43,419
Speaker 0: Your modern motherboard probably won't even support one or two.

469
00:30:43,700 --> 00:30:44,399
Speaker 0: It's just three only.

470
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:45,769
Speaker 0: And what happens when you sleep?

471
00:30:45,890 --> 00:30:50,016
Speaker 0: a computer, a modern PC, it's like closing a lid on your laptop.

472
00:30:50,036 --> 00:30:50,520
Speaker 0: That's sleeping.

473
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:59,159
Speaker 0: What happens is the computer will still draw electricity, but it will turn off just about everything it needs for you to use it.

474
00:31:00,062 --> 00:31:01,380
Speaker 0: So it will turn off the hard drives.

475
00:31:01,842 --> 00:31:04,180
Speaker 0: If they're magnets, it'll stop spinning the hard drive motors.

476
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:05,827
Speaker 0: It'll turn off the monitors.

477
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:08,179
Speaker 0: It'll turn off a lot of USB ports.

478
00:31:08,865 --> 00:31:10,319
Speaker 1: Not all of them, but a lot of them.

479
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,560
Speaker 1: Well, it gets complicated.

480
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:15,699
Speaker 1: It'll attempt to turn off a lot of USB ports, but some USB ports can force themselves to stay up.

481
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,840
Speaker 0: Right, some of them will still charge devices depending on your settings.

482
00:31:19,643 --> 00:31:21,131
Speaker 1: If you've ever seen, you know there's like blue.

483
00:31:21,232 --> 00:31:25,600
Speaker 1: USB ports generally mean like USB 3, and I'm making quotes because it's all complicated.

484
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:29,821
Speaker 1: And if they don't have a color or they're black, it's just USB 2.

485
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,400
Speaker 1: If they're white, it might be 2 or it might be old 1.

486
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:36,020
Speaker 1: But if it's yellow, yellow means it'll still have power.

487
00:31:36,121 --> 00:31:37,400
Speaker 0: On some computers it does that.

488
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:42,780
Speaker 0: I have the option in my BIOS on my computer to like still maintain power to some ports.

489
00:31:43,100 --> 00:31:43,705
Speaker 0: But they're all blue.

490
00:31:43,745 --> 00:31:45,317
Speaker 0: You don't have to figure out which ones they are.

491
00:31:46,202 --> 00:31:48,220
Speaker 0: I see some laptops do the yellow thing.

492
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:57,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, on my old laptop, the yellow meant that if the laptop's plugged in, it'll just power the pins for charging devices on that without otherwise interacting with anything.

493
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:03,260
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is when you sleep a computer, it turns off a lot of things, right?

494
00:32:03,401 --> 00:32:07,500
Speaker 0: But it holds the memory in the RAM and it holds the CPU state.

495
00:32:07,882 --> 00:32:09,532
Speaker 0: It doesn't do any processing.

496
00:32:09,853 --> 00:32:10,859
Speaker 0: It just holds.

497
00:32:11,602 --> 00:32:13,373
Speaker 0: And it doesn't turn off.

498
00:32:13,413 --> 00:32:14,460
Speaker 0: It doesn't hibernate.

499
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,269
Speaker 0: It just holds where it is.

500
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:18,160
Speaker 0: It uses the minimum electricity it can.

501
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:21,536
Speaker 0: to remember what the fuck the computer was doing at the moment.

502
00:32:21,556 --> 00:32:22,360
Speaker 0: you told it to sleep.

503
00:32:23,022 --> 00:32:26,460
Speaker 0: And turn off as much as it can to use as little electricity as it can.

504
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:36,760
Speaker 0: That way you can push a button on the keyboard or move the mouse or something like that because obviously you wouldn't know if you pushed the keyboard or mouse if it was hibernating or off because they'd have no power.

505
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:44,779
Speaker 0: It's still powering the mouse and keyboard so that way it knows if you move them or push a button on them so that it can now wake up and go back to being on.

506
00:32:45,582 --> 00:32:46,208
Speaker 0: And on is just S0.

507
00:32:46,248 --> 00:32:46,954
Speaker 0: Zero is on.

508
00:32:48,701 --> 00:32:58,280
Speaker 1: So my current problem with my current computer that started two Windows updates ago and I tried to troubleshoot it and this is difficult because there's a lot of moving parts.

509
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:04,378
Speaker 1: I don't care that much but basically once my computer sleeps nothing will turn it back on.

510
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:09,400
Speaker 1: Short of physically forcing it to boot anew.

511
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:11,949
Speaker 1: No input device will trigger it.

512
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,060
Speaker 1: No wake on LAN type thing will trigger it.

513
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,608
Speaker 1: The power button will not trigger it.

514
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:17,219
Speaker 1: It just cannot turn back on.

515
00:33:18,321 --> 00:33:24,660
Speaker 1: But I can force it to turn back on by doing the "hold the power button for 4 seconds" thing.

516
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:29,180
Speaker 1: And that'll basically force it to power off and then I can power it on normally.

517
00:33:29,821 --> 00:33:30,839
Speaker 0: You gotta go off first.

518
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,600
Speaker 1: Off first then it'll power back on.

519
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,659
Speaker 0: Way different problem than me.

520
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:40,000
Speaker 1: And I will talk later about if we have time at the end of the show for how I have attempted to troubleshoot this.

521
00:33:40,442 --> 00:33:46,100
Speaker 1: and all I will say is that even if you know a lot about computers this type of stuff is actually really hard to troubleshoot.

522
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:47,770
Speaker 0: It's so poorly documented too.

523
00:33:47,851 --> 00:33:55,980
Speaker 0: When you get your motherboard instructions like half the settings in your BIOS or UEFI are about this power settings and there's almost no instructions in the motherboard.

524
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:00,920
Speaker 0: And even if you google, people barely know what these different settings do and they're not self-explanatory at all.

525
00:34:00,920 --> 00:34:09,620
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I still have the manual that came with my 486 and it has hyper detailed explanations of the potential power saving modes that could enable.

526
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, but modern motherboards.

527
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:13,960
Speaker 0: Every motherboard's got different settings and they're all different explanations.

528
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,230
Speaker 0: And it's all bullshit.

529
00:34:15,311 --> 00:34:15,473
Speaker 0: Anyway.

530
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,719
Speaker 0: So another thing you gotta be worried about is all those S things we just talked about for PCs.

531
00:34:21,362 --> 00:34:24,000
Speaker 0: that's under like the ACPI spec.

532
00:34:24,681 --> 00:34:26,271
Speaker 0: There's other things going on.

533
00:34:26,312 --> 00:34:29,880
Speaker 0: There's like ASPM which I think is Active State Power Management.

534
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,800
Speaker 1: Oh god, I don't even know a lot about that.

535
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:35,560
Speaker 0: That is a separate thing just for PCI Express.

536
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:48,199
Speaker 0: So it's like you tell your computer shit along the lines of like yeah, you manage the power of these different PCI Express devices when we're sleeping, when we're hibernating, when we're soft off, when we're whatever.

537
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:50,560
Speaker 1: Ooh, that's like the old, like I remember doing something.

538
00:34:50,820 --> 00:34:52,760
Speaker 1: It definitely wasn't that because it was way old, but.

539
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:53,860
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, hey.

540
00:34:53,940 --> 00:34:58,420
Speaker 1: I wanted Wake on LAN to work on my old PC and I had an ISA network card.

541
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,879
Speaker 0: Right, because if something's built into the motherboard, let's say a network card, you want to have Wake on LAN.

542
00:35:03,843 --> 00:35:06,600
Speaker 0: Which means you want to be able to turn the computer on via the network.

543
00:35:06,740 --> 00:35:09,739
Speaker 0: Well that means no matter how off the computer is.

544
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,040
Speaker 1: The network card has to be able to receive packets.

545
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,960
Speaker 0: The network card needs some power, right?

546
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,428
Speaker 0: So this can be annoying.

547
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:17,360
Speaker 0: Wake on LAN is a whole host of issues.

548
00:35:17,461 --> 00:35:20,120
Speaker 0: Sometimes the computer will turn on too easily from any old packet.

549
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:24,580
Speaker 1: Because old networks, there wouldn't be any packets unless they were for you.

550
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:27,780
Speaker 0: Right, and now it's like, well I need to actually look at the packet to decide if I'm going to turn on.

551
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,120
Speaker 0: Well now you need more power to run your network card's processor a little more.

552
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,956
Speaker 1: Or you need to be fully awake so the processor can do something.

553
00:35:33,996 --> 00:35:34,640
Speaker 1: and then what the fuck.

554
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:49,320
Speaker 0: Anyway, point is, if you have this, the ASPM stuff is basically a way for your computer and your OS and your motherboard and everything to work together to be like, Okay, you have these PCI express cards, let's figure out when we're sleeping which ones need power and how much.

555
00:35:49,641 --> 00:35:51,771
Speaker 0: When we're hibernating which ones need power and how much.

556
00:35:51,811 --> 00:35:53,800
Speaker 0: when we're off which ones need power and how much.

557
00:35:53,900 --> 00:36:01,780
Speaker 1: And all I'll say about this is a lot of odd PCI express cards will have their own nonsense that makes them incompatible with this.

558
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:08,860
Speaker 1: Like, I have a FireWire card, good fucking luck if your computer tries to tell that thing to go to sleep.

559
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,800
Speaker 1: Recovering from that without rebooting.

560
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:13,720
Speaker 0: So this shit gets really complicated really fast, it's really annoying.

561
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,408
Speaker 0: And that's only in computers.

562
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:17,200
Speaker 0: Think about other things.

563
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:21,519
Speaker 1: Someone in the stream just asked, so how does low power mode work on my iPhone X?

564
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,305
Speaker 0: Exactly.

565
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:27,000
Speaker 0: So low power mode on a phone, right?

566
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:33,560
Speaker 0: It's like, well, you can obviously just when you click the button on the side of your phone, just turn the screen off.

567
00:36:33,941 --> 00:36:35,729
Speaker 0: That's basically sleep, right?

568
00:36:35,789 --> 00:36:38,020
Speaker 0: The phone's not off, it's still doing all kinds of stuff.

569
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:41,440
Speaker 0: You're just turning the screen off and turning some other things off, right?

570
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:44,577
Speaker 0: But it's still on, it still will take a phone call if you get called, right?

571
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,480
Speaker 0: It'll still get a notification if you get a notification.

572
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:52,500
Speaker 0: It's just turning the screen off and turning enough things off so that it can save power.

573
00:36:53,181 --> 00:37:04,820
Speaker 0: If you actually go into the settings and choose low power mode on your phone or something like that, what then it's doing is it's actually disabling features as much as possible to extend the battery.

574
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:05,962
Speaker 0: Right.

575
00:37:06,022 --> 00:37:08,190
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, well, let's stop checking for notifications.

576
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,980
Speaker 0: Let's stop updating our GPS for your weather constantly.

577
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:14,479
Speaker 1: Let's stop doing the smooth scrolling so we don't have to spin up that GPU.

578
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:15,302
Speaker 0: Right.

579
00:37:15,382 --> 00:37:19,820
Speaker 0: It's like let's degrade and turn off software and turn off features.

580
00:37:20,481 --> 00:37:20,721
Speaker 0: Right.

581
00:37:20,922 --> 00:37:27,260
Speaker 0: So that we can just get this battery to last as long as we can and have the phone just like not fucking do anything.

582
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:28,884
Speaker 1: You said the magic word.

583
00:37:28,964 --> 00:37:35,040
Speaker 1: This is one of the fundamental divides between what we mean when we talk about power saving modes.

584
00:37:35,420 --> 00:37:40,360
Speaker 1: If a thing is intended to always be plugged into power, power saving modes are there to protect the environment.

585
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:48,140
Speaker 1: If your device is using a battery, power saving modes are intended to deal with the fact that battery technology has not kept up with society.

586
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:52,600
Speaker 1: And they are radically different problem spaces.

587
00:37:54,202 --> 00:37:59,420
Speaker 1: And one of the reasons why they're so radically different is that batteries have yet another problem.

588
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:10,840
Speaker 1: Depending on how you charge and drain the battery, you can have a device that performs better or saves power in the short term, but physically destroys the battery itself faster.

589
00:38:11,922 --> 00:38:15,840
Speaker 1: And those things are all configurable in phones now and configurable laptops now.

590
00:38:16,504 --> 00:38:19,040
Speaker 1: And they're too complicated for most people to understand and use.

591
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,673
Speaker 0: You got to think about other devices too, not even computational devices.

592
00:38:22,854 --> 00:38:24,139
Speaker 0: Say like, I don't know.

593
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:26,168
Speaker 1: A bike computer, I guess doesn't matter.

594
00:38:26,208 --> 00:38:28,740
Speaker 1: You put an intrinsic battery in there and it'll last for a year.

595
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,568
Speaker 0: Say your microwave, right?

596
00:38:30,588 --> 00:38:32,920
Speaker 0: Well your microwave, you plug it into the wall, right?

597
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:34,585
Speaker 0: It's got a fucking clock.

598
00:38:35,067 --> 00:38:38,660
Speaker 0: It's always drawing this tiny amount of power to keep that clock going.

599
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:41,310
Speaker 0: You unplug that microwave, two seconds, boom, clock's reset.

600
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,218
Speaker 0: There's no battery in there to keep that clock's time.

601
00:38:43,641 --> 00:38:44,640
Speaker 0: Maybe some microwave has it.

602
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,439
Speaker 1: In fact, I just got to notice they're going to turn off power to my building at some point like this week.

603
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:52,040
Speaker 1: So all those clocks are just going to be blinking 12 and I got to fix them all.

604
00:38:52,341 --> 00:38:56,560
Speaker 0: I don't know why they don't put like tiny coin cell batteries in there to keep the battery going.

605
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,580
Speaker 1: The answer to a lot of these more fundamental questions are late capitalism and a lack of care for wasting electricity.

606
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:05,840
Speaker 0: My rice cooker has a coin cell battery inside.

607
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:07,559
Speaker 1: It's mine because I have a very nice rice cooker.

608
00:39:08,021 --> 00:39:12,793
Speaker 0: And mine, I've had the rice cooker so long because it's so nice that it doesn't hold.

609
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:15,600
Speaker 0: the coin cell battery ran out and you can't replace it.

610
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,808
Speaker 0: It's not user replaceable.

611
00:39:17,151 --> 00:39:18,360
Speaker 0: I don't want to open my rice cooker.

612
00:39:19,201 --> 00:39:23,040
Speaker 0: So I only get time on the rice cooker when I plug it in and I don't even plugged in all the time.

613
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:29,920
Speaker 1: So get this, my rice cooker, this tiny little screen that shows the clock, it shows the clock and it's like a really bright like interface there.

614
00:39:30,461 --> 00:39:34,920
Speaker 1: If I unplug it, it still shows the clock, but it gets way dimmer to save power.

615
00:39:35,141 --> 00:39:35,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine did too.

616
00:39:35,923 --> 00:39:40,820
Speaker 0: It just, I've had it so long, 10 plus years, that rice cooker anyway.

617
00:39:41,640 --> 00:39:52,340
Speaker 0: But yeah, every device that you have that plugs into the wall is going to be taking some, you know, hopefully like a light, a lamp is going to take zero power when you have it off, right?

618
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,751
Speaker 1: Well, that should accept some smart lamp bullshit.

619
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,061
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

620
00:39:57,142 --> 00:40:03,380
Speaker 1: Smart lamps draw power to run themselves or LEDs require ballasts and things.

621
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:09,500
Speaker 1: Like they have to be converted to DC power or voltage up, like fluorescence need voltage up regulation.

622
00:40:09,881 --> 00:40:11,285
Speaker 1: All sorts of nonsense has to happen.

623
00:40:11,706 --> 00:40:16,080
Speaker 1: Anytime you're converting from AC to DC, you have to have a transformer.

624
00:40:16,701 --> 00:40:23,600
Speaker 1: And usually that transformer is between the outlets and your device and will just constantly be leeching power as long as it's plugged in.

625
00:40:24,282 --> 00:40:27,380
Speaker 1: Unless the switch is physically in the transformer.

626
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:32,035
Speaker 0: You got some kind of timer or something between your lamp and the wall to cut the power, right?

627
00:40:32,075 --> 00:40:32,537
Speaker 0: Completely.

628
00:40:32,557 --> 00:40:32,637
Speaker 0: Yeah.

629
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:36,126
Speaker 0: The other thing you got to think about is like a television, right?

630
00:40:36,347 --> 00:40:40,900
Speaker 0: Even if you have a television that's not a smart TV, just an old regular flat screen TV, right?

631
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,342
Speaker 0: Or even a CRT.

632
00:40:42,683 --> 00:40:51,660
Speaker 0: If it has a remote control, that TV is always drawing power because the IR receiver needs to be powered in order to know when you push the power button on the remote control.

633
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,587
Speaker 1: Unless you have a TV old enough to have a physical wired remote, which I did have.

634
00:40:57,148 --> 00:41:05,760
Speaker 0: Another thing that you don't think about is that TVs, you expect when you push the power button for that TV to turn the fuck right on.

635
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:08,668
Speaker 0: You don't want to be like push power button, wait, wait, wait.

636
00:41:08,728 --> 00:41:12,380
Speaker 1: Well, I'm already like, I push power button, my TV takes like seven seconds to boot.

637
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,603
Speaker 1: It's not even a smart TV, it's just shitty.

638
00:41:15,623 --> 00:41:17,386
Speaker 0: The point is you want it to go fast, right?

639
00:41:17,746 --> 00:41:24,056
Speaker 0: But the TV has inside of it these capacitors that need to be filled up in order for the TV to turn on.

640
00:41:24,076 --> 00:41:26,340
Speaker 1: Not as much as old CRT TVs.

641
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:29,024
Speaker 0: It's gotten better, but there's still some in there, right?

642
00:41:29,284 --> 00:41:33,851
Speaker 0: If you unplug your TV from the wall, those capacitors will slowly drain.

643
00:41:33,871 --> 00:41:39,320
Speaker 0: and then if you plug your TV back in, they'll slowly fill up as soon as you plug the TV back in.

644
00:41:39,701 --> 00:41:44,809
Speaker 0: If you unplug the TV, wait a long time for them to drain or dangerously drain them, do not do that.

645
00:41:46,211 --> 00:41:51,480
Speaker 0: And then plug the TV back in and push the power button, the TV might have some trouble turning on if you do that.

646
00:41:51,740 --> 00:42:05,818
Speaker 0: And the thing is, that slow drain, even though it might be ridiculously slow, it's still greater than zero, the power that is constantly trickling to keep them always full.

647
00:42:06,138 --> 00:42:07,660
Speaker 0: for that moment you push the power button.

648
00:42:09,781 --> 00:42:10,822
Speaker 1: So where are we going with all this?

649
00:42:11,123 --> 00:42:20,416
Speaker 1: The progression, I think, the problem with PCs is that the model and how power saving is done is so inconsistent and so shitty and so poorly documented.

650
00:42:20,756 --> 00:42:23,420
Speaker 1: And even if it's documented, it's not implemented according to the documentation.

651
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:29,972
Speaker 0: And it's rare that it works perfectly, unless you buy like a MacBook running OS X and you don't mess with it.

652
00:42:30,072 --> 00:42:31,895
Speaker 0: Even then, I doubt it will always work perfectly.

653
00:42:32,256 --> 00:42:33,658
Speaker 0: You'll be like, sleep in it, it won't.

654
00:42:33,919 --> 00:42:34,600
Speaker 0: Or hibernate, it won't.

655
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:46,360
Speaker 1: And phones have gone a different route in the sense that because the phones are a little bit more proprietary and self-contained, like I've watched this progression on Android, I can't speak to iPhone, where originally my Android phones would just, they used power at the rate they used it.

656
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,221
Speaker 1: You want to use less power?

657
00:42:47,261 --> 00:42:50,385
Speaker 1: Just dim the screen, put it in airplane mode.

658
00:42:50,806 --> 00:43:02,160
Speaker 1: But over time, Android started adding all these features, like I could configure power saving things, but then it evolved to, it just made a bunch of automatic intelligent defaults about power saving.

659
00:43:02,661 --> 00:43:06,209
Speaker 1: And then it moved into even more advanced intelligent defaults.

660
00:43:06,229 --> 00:43:11,300
Speaker 1: So now my phone automatically, and I could configure this, but I don't need to, I don't care that much.

661
00:43:11,621 --> 00:43:20,300
Speaker 1: If it hits like 15% battery, it just automatically suspends as much as it can to save as much battery as possible without preventing basic things from working.

662
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:27,510
Speaker 1: And then I can choose, whenever that happens, a button pops up and I can go in and hit the button and say, no, no, no, save as much battery as possible.

663
00:43:27,851 --> 00:43:33,520
Speaker 1: And then it'll just turn off way more stuff to save the battery as much as physically possible.

664
00:43:34,260 --> 00:43:44,656
Speaker 1: And by removing the complexity and just making it work with intelligent defaults, my phone just lasts a lot longer and no one has to learn a bunch of ACPI type nonsense.

665
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:47,280
Speaker 1: Desktop PCs need to somehow get to that point.

666
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:54,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, if you buy a desktop PC where the OS is already installed from the vendor or whatever, laptop especially, hopefully all this stuff is working great.

667
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,309
Speaker 1: I have it on good authority, it still doesn't work.

668
00:43:56,329 --> 00:43:58,399
Speaker 1: I know people buying like a brand new PC.

669
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:00,799
Speaker 0: I close the lid and the screen doesn't turn off.

670
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,045
Speaker 1: Yup.

671
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:02,820
Speaker 0: You know, all kinds of bullshit, right?

672
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:04,379
Speaker 1: I can go configure all that.

673
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:05,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, good luck.

674
00:44:06,020 --> 00:44:16,580
Speaker 1: And to this day, I still see so many people walking around like in my office carrying a modern MacBook and they're walking, holding it open with their finger between the clamp, like on an elevator.

675
00:44:17,162 --> 00:44:18,920
Speaker 1: I don't understand why people are like that.

676
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,119
Speaker 0: I forgot one thing, which is the hybrid sleep mode.

677
00:44:23,422 --> 00:44:25,510
Speaker 0: So hybrid sleep mode is actually not.

678
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,300
Speaker 0: it's actually just sleep mode, right?

679
00:44:28,360 --> 00:44:29,162
Speaker 0: It's not any different.

680
00:44:29,183 --> 00:44:32,733
Speaker 0: It's not a different level as far as the motherboard or the hardware is concerned.

681
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,000
Speaker 0: It's like an OS thing where Windows can do.

682
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:36,244
Speaker 0: I don't know if OS X does.

683
00:44:36,325 --> 00:44:36,847
Speaker 0: it is.

684
00:44:37,249 --> 00:44:39,780
Speaker 0: you say sleep and it goes, OK, I go to sleep.

685
00:44:40,283 --> 00:44:42,600
Speaker 0: But in addition to sleeping, it sleeps like normal.

686
00:44:43,362 --> 00:44:48,060
Speaker 0: In addition to sleeping, it will write the hibernation file just like when it hibernates to the disk.

687
00:44:48,483 --> 00:44:49,513
Speaker 0: In addition to sleeping.

688
00:44:50,139 --> 00:44:50,300
Speaker 0: Right.

689
00:44:50,720 --> 00:45:00,440
Speaker 0: So that way, if something happens while it's sleeping, say it gets turned off or power goes out or who knows, and you turn it back on, it's like, well, it was like you were hibernating.

690
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,646
Speaker 0: We're going back to where you started.

691
00:45:02,008 --> 00:45:03,899
Speaker 0: Sorry, you had to turn me all the way back on.

692
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:06,520
Speaker 0: I was, you know, I fell too much asleep.

693
00:45:07,421 --> 00:45:09,220
Speaker 1: That works fine on my computer.

694
00:45:09,402 --> 00:45:09,536
Speaker 1: Yup.

695
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:12,999
Speaker 1: But regular as sleep mode, I can't wake up from it.

696
00:45:13,281 --> 00:45:13,387
Speaker 1: Yup.

697
00:45:14,541 --> 00:45:17,099
Speaker 0: It's too long to say what's wrong with my home theater PC.

698
00:45:17,363 --> 00:45:18,419
Speaker 1: I'm currently investigating.

699
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:24,700
Speaker 0: I wouldn't mind if it was my regular PC as much because when you sit down at a desktop, the power buttons right there.

700
00:45:24,780 --> 00:45:25,516
Speaker 0: I don't mind pushing it.

701
00:45:25,902 --> 00:45:27,920
Speaker 0: But for the fucking HDPC, I'm on the couch.

702
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:28,720
Speaker 0: It's really important.

703
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:32,619
Speaker 0: I want it to sleep only because if it hibernates or goes off, I have to get up to turn it on.

704
00:45:33,162 --> 00:45:35,840
Speaker 0: And I don't want to leave it on all the time because it's wasting a lot of electricity.

705
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:45,160
Speaker 1: And my desktop PC, I turn the fuck off because my desktop PC, when I'm actually using it, draws a ton of power because it's really a workstation.

706
00:45:45,389 --> 00:45:45,556
Speaker 1: Yup.

707
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,179
Speaker 0: I might just end up leaving the HDPC on.

708
00:45:48,601 --> 00:45:49,919
Speaker 0: I kind of don't want to.

709
00:45:50,140 --> 00:45:50,699
Speaker 0: It's real bad.

710
00:45:51,180 --> 00:45:58,039
Speaker 1: So my thinking for PCs, honestly, is that OS X should just do things to make it work.

711
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,679
Speaker 1: Like Apple can just make it work.

712
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:01,919
Speaker 1: If it doesn't work on an Apple device, like what the hell?

713
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:10,120
Speaker 1: PCs, we should just assume that every PC is running Windows and just make power saving work with Windows.

714
00:46:10,502 --> 00:46:13,879
Speaker 1: Because if it's a server, power saving is a whole different world.

715
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:16,919
Speaker 1: Consumers are not running Linux on the desktop.

716
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:18,379
Speaker 1: That ship sailed and sank.

717
00:46:20,641 --> 00:46:26,920
Speaker 1: So I feel like we should just assume Windows and make assumptions based on that to make this just work a little bit better on desktops.

718
00:46:27,421 --> 00:46:30,480
Speaker 0: They've been working on this for years and years and years.

719
00:46:30,820 --> 00:46:38,440
Speaker 0: And Microsoft and the motherboard companies and CPU companies still have not been able to make this all work perfectly in all computers.

720
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:38,830
Speaker 0: Yup.

721
00:46:40,503 --> 00:46:42,919
Speaker 1: And yeah, there isn't really a cool story, bro.

722
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,140
Speaker 0: The thing is, this is really not an issue for any kind of server or anything ever, right?

723
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:48,779
Speaker 0: Because servers are either on or off.

724
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:50,639
Speaker 0: You don't want to have a server go to sleep.

725
00:46:51,021 --> 00:46:51,658
Speaker 0: What's the point of that?

726
00:46:52,703 --> 00:46:52,980
Speaker 1: Or hibernate.

727
00:46:53,380 --> 00:46:54,420
Speaker 1: I might have servers that...

728
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:58,420
Speaker 0: You might want a server to have a hibernation file in case it ever gets turned off.

729
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,198
Speaker 0: You can turn it back on.

730
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:01,260
Speaker 0: But there's other ways to solve that problem for servers.

731
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:01,693
Speaker 0: Yeah.

732
00:47:01,924 --> 00:47:02,080
Speaker 0: Right?

733
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:03,339
Speaker 0: You don't need to do that.

734
00:47:04,001 --> 00:47:06,060
Speaker 0: And it's like, they're never going to go hibernate.

735
00:47:06,220 --> 00:47:06,800
Speaker 0: They're never going to sleep.

736
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:07,879
Speaker 0: They're going to be on or off.

737
00:47:08,108 --> 00:47:08,339
Speaker 1: Yeah.

738
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:19,600
Speaker 1: And maybe you're using complex modern virtualization where the hardware is being power managed in a world entirely outside of whatever operating systems you're running shit in.

739
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:19,949
Speaker 0: Yup.

740
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:21,259
Speaker 0: That's usually what happens.

741
00:47:21,782 --> 00:47:22,919
Speaker 0: Especially cloud services.

742
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:23,350
Speaker 0: Yup.

743
00:47:23,660 --> 00:47:24,920
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

744
00:47:25,180 --> 00:47:26,800
Speaker 0: It's only a user computer issue.

745
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:31,960
Speaker 1: So for the time being, I just power my computer off every day after we do Geek Nights.

746
00:47:38,162 --> 00:47:40,300
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

747
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:45,440
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
