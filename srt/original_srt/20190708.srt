1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:11,142
Speaker 0: It's Monday July 8th 2019.

2
00:00:11,142 --> 00:00:16,620
Speaker 0: I'm rim Scott and this is geek nights tonight the dark web.

3
00:00:18,383 --> 00:00:19,396
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,622 --> 00:00:25,619
Speaker 1: So over the weekend we went back to Racha to visit some friends.

5
00:00:26,342 --> 00:00:30,293
Speaker 0: City of Rochester that birthed us into this world as a functioning semi.

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:34,967
Speaker 1: adults spab some 4th of July festivities Especially since you know we couldn't.

7
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:37,339
Speaker 1: the fireworks in the city have moved to where we can't see them.

8
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:43,298
Speaker 1: Story of fireworks yeah, but we already saw those on Thursday, so what reason is there to stay in town?

9
00:00:43,358 --> 00:00:43,760
Speaker 1: not much.

10
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,952
Speaker 1: So to get to Racha cha there's three options to get there.

11
00:00:46,992 --> 00:00:48,317
Speaker 1: reasonably reason way.

12
00:00:48,358 --> 00:00:52,117
Speaker 1: number one Drive a car for six hours now fucking sucks.

13
00:00:52,178 --> 00:00:55,491
Speaker 1: It sucks Six hours each way by the way.

14
00:00:55,691 --> 00:00:56,273
Speaker 0: I've done that.

15
00:00:56,314 --> 00:00:57,980
Speaker 0: drive many many many.

16
00:00:59,363 --> 00:01:00,066
Speaker 1: It is unpleasant.

17
00:01:00,086 --> 00:01:01,050
Speaker 0: take route 17 well.

18
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,994
Speaker 0: I guess now I 86. yeah anyway.

19
00:01:03,901 --> 00:01:05,566
Speaker 1: So I wanted to avoid that.

20
00:01:05,747 --> 00:01:08,977
Speaker 1: so option two is take Amtrak and then have someone pick you up.

21
00:01:09,017 --> 00:01:13,374
Speaker 1: the train station is in a Shitty place the train is unreliable, and it still takes for fucking ever.

22
00:01:13,395 --> 00:01:14,319
Speaker 1: you're better off in the car.

23
00:01:14,399 --> 00:01:20,475
Speaker 0: however I would say you're not better off in the car because You can take a sleeper car which costs basically nothing on a fucking ever.

24
00:01:20,816 --> 00:01:21,659
Speaker 0: yeah, but you know what?

25
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,520
Speaker 0: You basically just hang out in a private comfortable room anyway with good with pretty good food and internet the whole time.

26
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:37,375
Speaker 1: option three is pay Some money, but actually quite a reasonable amount of money yeah, and fly there.

27
00:01:37,455 --> 00:01:39,280
Speaker 1: you spend some time waiting at the airport.

28
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:45,665
Speaker 1: But even with the airport time which is what like an hour Maybe right on each end waiting for the plane You know you gotta get there a little early.

29
00:01:45,685 --> 00:01:46,789
Speaker 1: get their security right.

30
00:01:47,191 --> 00:01:49,460
Speaker 1: the plane is literally like up snacks land.

31
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:54,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like 45 minute like you know And the flying time is like 40 minutes or less.

32
00:01:54,769 --> 00:01:56,675
Speaker 0: like the rest of the time is the taxi way.

33
00:01:56,696 --> 00:02:03,795
Speaker 1: like the plane takes off You get in the air they turn the seatbelt sign off you take out your switch You start playing Mario maker, and yeah, it's like all right.

34
00:02:03,815 --> 00:02:04,580
Speaker 1: We are now landing.

35
00:02:04,741 --> 00:02:07,693
Speaker 0: It's like I didn't even finish one episode of Voyager cuz.

36
00:02:07,733 --> 00:02:09,520
Speaker 0: I'd one episode I hadn't watched so I started.

37
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:10,545
Speaker 1: They bring you the cheese.

38
00:02:10,626 --> 00:02:12,436
Speaker 1: It's you open them you eat them you throw them out your land.

39
00:02:12,597 --> 00:02:15,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's great It's totally worth the money if you can afford it.

40
00:02:15,841 --> 00:02:22,299
Speaker 1: I mean, it's actually compared to like you know if you think of the total cost of car ownership You know in the gas and stuff.

41
00:02:22,722 --> 00:02:24,330
Speaker 1: I guess you have a lot of people in the car.

42
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:27,207
Speaker 1: you're saving a lot of money driving yeah But less people.

43
00:02:27,227 --> 00:02:29,080
Speaker 1: it's like if you're only one person driving.

44
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:40,194
Speaker 1: It's like the plane is actually pretty comparable price wise and it's the plane is the Amtrak Which is the worst of the three is no cheaper than the money by any means.

45
00:02:40,254 --> 00:02:50,294
Speaker 1: so I do like long Amtrak rides But the problem is that costs time yep, and while I wore that amount of money You get a lot more time hanging with your friends.

46
00:02:50,314 --> 00:02:54,660
Speaker 1: You don't see a lot in Rochester Yeah, and I'll even better comfort and a lot easier weekend.

47
00:02:54,782 --> 00:02:55,917
Speaker 0: So what's funny is that?

48
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,839
Speaker 0: The real like the reason we're talking about this before we do the rest of the show is that for a long time like I?

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,106
Speaker 0: Don't like jet blue anymore.

50
00:03:02,186 --> 00:03:11,518
Speaker 0: like they're really like they're late a lot and Usually Delta is actually cheaper depending on when I'm going like I fly Delta like 80% of the time when I fly these days.

51
00:03:11,538 --> 00:03:13,988
Speaker 0: yeah I usually and many times I fly Delta.

52
00:03:14,008 --> 00:03:15,955
Speaker 0: a friend of mine flies jet blue.

53
00:03:15,975 --> 00:03:17,400
Speaker 0: I arrive on time.

54
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,507
Speaker 0: They're three hours late.

55
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:19,271
Speaker 0: that happens a lot.

56
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:23,009
Speaker 1: usually I fly jet blue But these days since jet blue has gone downhill.

57
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:25,980
Speaker 1: it used to be I flew jet blue when it was more egalitarian.

58
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,743
Speaker 1: now They've still get now.

59
00:03:26,803 --> 00:03:28,651
Speaker 1: They've got first class and stuff.

60
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:30,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, we used to have no classes.

61
00:03:30,901 --> 00:03:32,488
Speaker 1: Yeah, it used to just be all the seats are the same.

62
00:03:32,509 --> 00:03:33,312
Speaker 1: It was great anyway.

63
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:37,038
Speaker 1: You know back in those days You know I flew jet blue all the time.

64
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:44,500
Speaker 1: But now I basically just go on Google flights or other comparison sites and get the cheapest flight that is the most convenient time.

65
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:44,922
Speaker 1: That's well.

66
00:03:45,002 --> 00:03:48,275
Speaker 0: That's direct and is not Spirit Airways or an equivalent.

67
00:03:48,435 --> 00:03:52,109
Speaker 1: right exactly never From a real legit airline.

68
00:03:52,149 --> 00:03:53,980
Speaker 1: that's not garbage like not flying United.

69
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:59,300
Speaker 0: But normally I would not fly jet blue because they're not that great anymore, but they do happen to fly to Rochester.

70
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:03,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, they happen to fly at a good time, and I used to fly jet blue a lot.

71
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,794
Speaker 0: I had so many jet blue points that I just used them to buy.

72
00:04:07,815 --> 00:04:09,380
Speaker 1: these guys didn't think about my points.

73
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:12,020
Speaker 1: I probably could have also gotten because I never used a jet blue point.

74
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,260
Speaker 0: I want to get use the points and then just never fly jet blue again, but anyway.

75
00:04:16,341 --> 00:04:23,221
Speaker 1: So I flew Delta because the instead of jet blue because it was the price difference was minuscule like 10 bucks or something each Way.

76
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:27,151
Speaker 1: the Delta was slightly cheaper, but the times of the Delta flights are much more convenient.

77
00:04:27,171 --> 00:04:33,207
Speaker 1: We're gonna leave right relatively early on Thursday on the 4th of July.

78
00:04:33,227 --> 00:04:43,080
Speaker 1: yeah get to Rochester early party party party And then leave Rochester early on Sunday get back home in New York in time for lunch and have a great old Sunday in New York.

79
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:46,115
Speaker 1: So getting to Rochester everything was a-okay.

80
00:04:46,457 --> 00:04:47,000
Speaker 1: going home.

81
00:04:47,423 --> 00:04:50,564
Speaker 1: Well, I woke up to get you know thinking all right Let me get my stuff together.

82
00:04:50,645 --> 00:04:53,196
Speaker 1: head over 10 minutes to the airport right you know?

83
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:56,749
Speaker 1: I look at my phone And it says flight delayed a few hours.

00:04:56,789 --> 00:04:57,391
Speaker 1: I'm like all right.

85
00:04:57,572 --> 00:04:57,752
Speaker 1: Well.

Speaker 1: I'll just you know not get up.

Speaker 1: eat a little food hang it.

91
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,667
Speaker 1: You know it's like three hours or whatever.

92
00:05:05,688 --> 00:05:07,757
Speaker 1: I'm like all right hanging out for three hours three hours.

93
00:05:07,798 --> 00:05:13,380
Speaker 1: Go bye Check my phone, it's the delay time has not changed whatsoever, so I'm like all right.

94
00:05:13,802 --> 00:05:14,767
Speaker 1: I guess I'm going to the airport.

95
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:17,279
Speaker 1: I'm glad I didn't have to sit at the airport for three hours.

96
00:05:18,262 --> 00:05:22,747
Speaker 1: Go to the airport and we get there and when we get there It still says you know the time.

97
00:05:22,807 --> 00:05:24,818
Speaker 1: it said on the on the phone, and I'm like all right.

98
00:05:24,958 --> 00:05:25,260
Speaker 1: It's cool.

99
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:29,740
Speaker 1: We're gonna sit here for like 30 minutes, and then get on plane right and then the time changes.

100
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:40,833
Speaker 1: They push it ahead like a couple hours, and I'm like well, that's Not the worst food in the world here meanwhile.

101
00:05:40,974 --> 00:05:42,200
Speaker 0: I took because I did jet blue.

102
00:05:42,943 --> 00:05:43,325
Speaker 0: I flew.

103
00:05:43,405 --> 00:05:46,700
Speaker 0: I was flying home at like six o'clock p.m.. On Sunday.

104
00:05:46,901 --> 00:05:50,493
Speaker 0: Yeah, I decided partly because I want to show the family home.

105
00:05:50,613 --> 00:05:52,741
Speaker 1: our plane was leaving Rochester at 11.

106
00:05:52,741 --> 00:06:01,932
Speaker 0: I would have been home and New York at like noon And I had planned a day of doing stuff with a family like in the Rochester area on Sunday And then getting home having dinner, and then just going to bed.

107
00:06:01,972 --> 00:06:03,900
Speaker 1: right the flight was delayed until like three.

108
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:14,140
Speaker 1: So I'm hanging out at the airport like to something and then suddenly It's like oh by the way four five Okay, well we're just gonna hang out here, and he gets to the point.

109
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:22,302
Speaker 0: There's no reason to leave and come back at this point right I head to the airport For my like 6 p.m.. Flight and lo and behold there's Scott There.

110
00:06:22,362 --> 00:06:22,924
Speaker 1: it's like they.

111
00:06:22,984 --> 00:06:25,292
Speaker 1: you know it was delayed that perfect amount of time.

112
00:06:25,313 --> 00:06:28,100
Speaker 1: where if it was delayed a one hour longer than that I would have left.

113
00:06:28,241 --> 00:06:33,011
Speaker 1: I would have called my friends and left and come back all right But it was just that right amount of time where it's like.

114
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:34,780
Speaker 1: oh not really worth it to leave and come back.

115
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:39,536
Speaker 0: You know I wish airlines if they're gonna be that delay do not be optimistic just be like yo.

116
00:06:39,596 --> 00:06:47,885
Speaker 1: this flight is not coming Yep, so basically what had happened was there was at the original delay was because of troubles at JFK Which also delayed rims fly.

117
00:06:47,926 --> 00:06:50,955
Speaker 0: my flight was delayed an hour to six from five.

118
00:06:51,216 --> 00:06:54,668
Speaker 0: they warned me way in advance So we just left for the airport way later.

119
00:06:54,688 --> 00:07:01,214
Speaker 1: Yep, but then aren't my specific plane Right had some kind of mechanical problem, and they were.

120
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:03,462
Speaker 1: they delayed it more and more Right.

121
00:07:03,502 --> 00:07:04,766
Speaker 1: and then there were flights.

122
00:07:04,826 --> 00:07:11,967
Speaker 1: there were two other Delta flights to New York that left basically on time Before our flight left.

123
00:07:12,228 --> 00:07:13,231
Speaker 1: yeah, they were scheduled.

124
00:07:13,271 --> 00:07:14,957
Speaker 1: their skiff lights were scheduled for like 6 p.m.

125
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:16,944
Speaker 1: To LaGuardia.

126
00:07:17,225 --> 00:07:20,599
Speaker 1: that plane left before my 11 a.m.. Flight to JFK.

127
00:07:20,921 --> 00:07:28,235
Speaker 1: They brought you that like sad Little Caesars bought a whole bunch of pizza for everybody to give me 5,000 miles I don't know how much if that's a lot or not.

128
00:07:28,397 --> 00:07:31,124
Speaker 0: That's That's an okay amount of miles.

129
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:42,248
Speaker 1: actually whatever the point is they kept changing the delay, but like an hour at a time Making us stay at the airport when we probably could have left and came back You know two or three hours later.

130
00:07:42,268 --> 00:07:45,749
Speaker 0: the last time I had a flight delayed that long as when I was trying to fly to Chicago for a conference.

131
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:46,920
Speaker 0: it was like a one-day conference.

132
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:48,067
Speaker 0: I was like gonna fly in the morning.

133
00:07:48,348 --> 00:07:52,400
Speaker 0: do a conference fly home like the next morning Yeah, so the flight was delayed for hours.

134
00:07:52,542 --> 00:07:55,346
Speaker 0: I was just like fuck it And I just canceled the whole trip and went home.

135
00:07:55,487 --> 00:07:59,644
Speaker 1: what actually ended up happening is that plane that was supposed to fly us was Clearly just broken.

136
00:07:59,665 --> 00:08:07,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, they took a plane from some other flight delayed that flight Yeah, used it for 90 minutes to fly to Rochester and back.

137
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:14,380
Speaker 1: So what's funny is from right and then gave that and then those other people who had to get on that flight That we were borrowing their plane for night there.

138
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:21,100
Speaker 1: So they were delayed 90 minutes or two hours while that plane was being used to bring people to Rochester eight hours late.

139
00:08:21,381 --> 00:08:26,540
Speaker 1: I actually feel worse for the people who are going to Rochester eight hours late than us going to New York.

140
00:08:27,581 --> 00:08:34,546
Speaker 1: After eight hours you're in New York, but also, you know if you're in Rochester, it's like you could you know Despite it being an eight-hour delay.

141
00:08:34,566 --> 00:08:38,179
Speaker 1: I was only at the airport three four hours because we showed up way late.

142
00:08:38,301 --> 00:08:41,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're if you if I would I is it going to JFK?

143
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:43,087
Speaker 1: I would have had to go to JFK on time.

144
00:08:43,509 --> 00:08:46,440
Speaker 1: You can't go out and come back in with that kind of security line.

145
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,460
Speaker 1: It's not like Rochester where the security takes two minutes, right?

146
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,797
Speaker 0: JFK security takes zero amount of time because I appreciate you have been extorted.

147
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:56,790
Speaker 0: you allowed yourself Because my company bought it for me.

148
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:58,739
Speaker 1: your company paid an extortion fee.

149
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:02,673
Speaker 0: You pay the big to get the services and the goods.

150
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:04,199
Speaker 1: the point is hey the big good.

151
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:17,111
Speaker 1: But if you leaving JFK got to admit to the cruel realities of an evil world and pay the big no If you leave JFK, even if you do Right, you're gonna take an hour air train ride.

152
00:09:17,131 --> 00:09:19,920
Speaker 1: then you take that all the way to Manhattan to take the train ride back.

153
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,534
Speaker 1: There you go that you didn't get to do anything because it took right.

154
00:09:22,554 --> 00:09:23,620
Speaker 1: you can leave LaGuardia.

155
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:27,837
Speaker 0: You can walk out and like walk to places where the LaGuardia Community College.

156
00:09:27,877 --> 00:09:28,440
Speaker 1: Where are you gonna go?

157
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:30,133
Speaker 0: There's a few restaurants and stuff over there.

158
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:32,789
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever Hang out in that park.

159
00:09:32,829 --> 00:09:46,000
Speaker 0: at least the one time I remember I was flying to Istanbul and The person who booked the flight for me, which was literally the last time I ever let anyone booked my flights instead of doing it Myself, they booked me through London and I missed the connection.

160
00:09:46,922 --> 00:09:49,256
Speaker 0: There weren't any flights to Istanbul for 12 hours.

161
00:09:50,602 --> 00:09:55,299
Speaker 0: So I had 12 hours to hang out in Heathrow which has horrific lines often to get into it.

162
00:09:56,364 --> 00:09:57,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway.

163
00:09:57,822 --> 00:10:06,300
Speaker 1: So I spent quite a few hours in the in the airport got home to New York way late Lost my afternoon in New York that I was expecting to have.

164
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:18,431
Speaker 0: Oh and also you got home and as soon as soon as you landed you were able to open up Chat and see that I had left you a friendly message warning you that the air train is fine But the e-train is F.

165
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:19,960
Speaker 1: I just paid a bunch of money and took a cab.

166
00:10:20,261 --> 00:10:22,713
Speaker 0: We were gonna take a cab, but then we didn't.

167
00:10:22,733 --> 00:10:23,838
Speaker 1: there were no lines for cabs.

168
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:26,568
Speaker 1: actually There was no line for what was happening the.

169
00:10:26,729 --> 00:10:29,799
Speaker 1: actually when we landed we were a terminal for you were probably terminal 5, right?

170
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:30,502
Speaker 1: Yep.

171
00:10:30,522 --> 00:10:33,978
Speaker 1: Yeah a terminal for when we landed was a complete shit show.

172
00:10:34,847 --> 00:10:38,312
Speaker 1: We were like the only Arrival and I didn't have checked bags.

173
00:10:38,332 --> 00:10:39,477
Speaker 1: So I just got in the cab.

174
00:10:39,518 --> 00:10:40,000
Speaker 1: There was no line.

175
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,087
Speaker 0: Oh, you wanna know what's going on?

176
00:10:41,127 --> 00:10:43,280
Speaker 0: There were a lot of other flight delays.

177
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:50,380
Speaker 1: There was like a mega mega shit show going on taxiing right because there's only one runway for departures.

178
00:10:50,762 --> 00:10:53,820
Speaker 1: So planes were having a hard time leaving JFK.

179
00:10:54,624 --> 00:10:56,978
Speaker 1: So we actually had to wait on the on.

180
00:10:57,078 --> 00:11:01,620
Speaker 1: you know The taxi around the JFK waiting for a gate to open to let us off the plane.

181
00:11:02,003 --> 00:11:05,847
Speaker 1: So we spent like 10 minutes just waiting to get off the plane Even though we it was such a tiny flight.

182
00:11:05,927 --> 00:11:08,840
Speaker 0: It's funny that happens a lot because JFK is currently under construction.

183
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:13,274
Speaker 0: So well, there's several like there's runways that cannot be used if the wind gets too high.

184
00:11:13,314 --> 00:11:17,772
Speaker 1: and then when we got into terminal 4 And we had we were basically they let us in the gate.

185
00:11:17,813 --> 00:11:18,818
Speaker 1: That was at this far.

186
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:22,820
Speaker 1: far I know that of the terminal we had to walk all the way.

187
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,420
Speaker 1: That's like a 20 minute walk on all four different people movers to get back to them the shopping mall zone.

188
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:32,614
Speaker 0: Of course, that's also the terminal that has the weird the secret way out.

189
00:11:32,855 --> 00:11:35,071
Speaker 0: if you don't have a check bag It just takes you right out of the term.

190
00:11:35,112 --> 00:11:41,386
Speaker 1: I did that too but the point is we As you're walking.

191
00:11:41,406 --> 00:11:46,911
Speaker 1: it was a complete madhouse on both sides of the people mover Every single flight we passed.

192
00:11:46,931 --> 00:11:48,880
Speaker 1: we were looking to see if they were delayed and whatnot.

193
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:55,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were huge lines like to board planes, but the people weren't boarding they were just crowding around waiting to board.

194
00:11:56,041 --> 00:12:02,680
Speaker 1: They were all international flights Copenhagen Prague and all these European flights Amsterdam Madrid.

195
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:04,047
Speaker 0: Another thing was going.

196
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:06,840
Speaker 1: all of those planes were waiting to depart.

197
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:10,500
Speaker 1: They couldn't leave because they had the single runway for departures.

198
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,388
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the whole terminal all the way down right?

199
00:12:13,408 --> 00:12:14,792
Speaker 1: Well, I walked the full lane.

200
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:17,199
Speaker 1: It was just just a complete shit show.

201
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:23,396
Speaker 1: And it's like well glad I'm not going to you know, like London at 9 o'clock at night.

202
00:12:23,597 --> 00:12:26,906
Speaker 0: Yep, which I Okay, I often would fly.

203
00:12:26,926 --> 00:12:29,232
Speaker 0: Well, usually I fly back from London like a Sunday.

204
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:33,790
Speaker 1: So anyway Airport yesterday was bad Yep, lost half a day in my life.

205
00:12:34,091 --> 00:12:34,433
Speaker 0: Yep.

206
00:12:34,655 --> 00:12:39,419
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I Spent my day having fun and my flight was only too late an hour and everything worked out.

207
00:12:40,281 --> 00:12:43,312
Speaker 0: So the moral is always fly Delta except that one time.

208
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:44,657
Speaker 1: Don't be unlucky.

209
00:12:44,757 --> 00:12:45,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't be unlucky.

210
00:12:48,201 --> 00:12:50,307
Speaker 0: JFK needs a lot more money to get fixed up.

211
00:12:50,468 --> 00:12:51,531
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's the real moral.

212
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:53,637
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of tech news.

213
00:12:54,299 --> 00:12:58,200
Speaker 0: Yep Let's start with this Quote unquote instructional video thing.

214
00:12:58,220 --> 00:13:06,950
Speaker 1: So someone had their YouTube video taken down and the reason given for the video being taken down was that they were teaching people how To hack and break into system.

215
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:10,966
Speaker 0: now already what I ask is one What is the line?

216
00:13:11,428 --> 00:13:12,592
Speaker 0: Yeah, what is the dev like?

217
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:13,896
Speaker 0: does lock picking count?

218
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:15,201
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is the thing It's like.

219
00:13:15,281 --> 00:13:22,520
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of security related YouTube videos showing you how to break security or like Def Con.

220
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:27,208
Speaker 0: You know Panels, how do you know so much about elevator hacking?

221
00:13:27,448 --> 00:13:31,640
Speaker 1: right there is tons of this content on YouTube and tons of it is educational.

222
00:13:33,081 --> 00:13:39,060
Speaker 1: The YouTube claims to have an educational exemption, but isn't all of it educational?

223
00:13:39,261 --> 00:13:47,030
Speaker 1: yeah, like wouldn't literally any video showing you how to get through or Circumvent a security measure be an educational video.

224
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:48,274
Speaker 1: Yeah, please by definition.

225
00:13:48,294 --> 00:13:49,016
Speaker 1: There is not.

226
00:13:49,056 --> 00:13:53,800
Speaker 1: it's like okay We're gonna have a ban on sports videos.

227
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:54,942
Speaker 1: Exception.

228
00:13:55,624 --> 00:13:57,811
Speaker 1: anyone getting sweaty makes the video.

229
00:13:57,932 --> 00:13:58,313
Speaker 1: Okay.

230
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:00,480
Speaker 1: Well, that means all sports videos are okay.

231
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:02,519
Speaker 1: What sports video has no one getting sweaty?

232
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:05,048
Speaker 0: Potentially golf late season.

233
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:06,133
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

234
00:14:06,213 --> 00:14:06,495
Speaker 1: It's like.

235
00:14:06,856 --> 00:14:07,258
Speaker 1: it's like.

236
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:11,339
Speaker 1: alright We're gonna ban videos that show hacking but allow educational ones.

237
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:18,695
Speaker 0: So what they say is there are no videos if the primary purpose is educational documentary Scientific or artistic.

238
00:14:18,715 --> 00:14:19,360
Speaker 1: so all of them?

239
00:14:19,588 --> 00:14:21,030
Speaker 1: Yeah Like it really all of them.

240
00:14:21,131 --> 00:14:23,987
Speaker 0: you ever watch a lot Excepting every single one.

241
00:14:24,128 --> 00:14:27,059
Speaker 1: every single video is an exception to the rule that bans the video.

242
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:28,925
Speaker 0: dude Yeah, you're a fan of like SGDQ.

243
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:31,554
Speaker 0: I've seen the equivalent for lock picking lock peeking.

244
00:14:31,614 --> 00:14:33,300
Speaker 0: races are really fun to watch.

245
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:36,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're in the same category as like Rubik's Cube races.

246
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:36,998
Speaker 0: Let's see.

247
00:14:37,018 --> 00:14:37,460
Speaker 0: So what do they say?

248
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:38,985
Speaker 0: I thought here's the actual YouTube thing.

249
00:14:39,326 --> 00:14:40,289
Speaker 0: So don't post.

250
00:14:40,329 --> 00:14:41,051
Speaker 0: concept of YouTube.

251
00:14:41,092 --> 00:14:43,540
Speaker 0: Here are the actual like words they wrote.

252
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,259
Speaker 0: extremely dangerous challenges.

253
00:14:46,943 --> 00:14:50,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, so apparently I guess we can't do our Mushroom challenge.

254
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:53,525
Speaker 0: Yeah Dangerous or threatening prank.

255
00:14:53,545 --> 00:14:54,589
Speaker 1: Let's just make it not a challenge.

256
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:55,372
Speaker 1: Just make it mushroom.

257
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:56,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like.

258
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,680
Speaker 1: hey not a challenge is mushroom.

259
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:58,744
Speaker 0: We're gonna eat this mushroom.

260
00:14:58,784 --> 00:14:59,809
Speaker 0: Don't you eat this mushroom?

261
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:01,013
Speaker 0: What is this mushroom?

262
00:15:01,034 --> 00:15:02,459
Speaker 0: We're about to find out in the woods.

263
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,991
Speaker 0: Instructions to kill.

264
00:15:06,011 --> 00:15:08,645
Speaker 1: I Guess do you need instructions?

265
00:15:08,726 --> 00:15:17,859
Speaker 1: take gun point the right end at the other person pull trigger at the end or harm Which is take knife pointed at rim move, but like or move it closer to rim until he says out.

266
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:22,120
Speaker 0: But here it's just like like providing instructions on how to build a bomb meant to injure or kill people.

267
00:15:22,200 --> 00:15:30,375
Speaker 1: So if I may take a lot of gunpowder put it in a small space light it on fire, but if I'm making Fireworks, that's probably fine.

268
00:15:30,415 --> 00:15:33,755
Speaker 1: I'm Too many of them bundled them together.

269
00:15:33,796 --> 00:15:34,540
Speaker 1: light them on fire.

270
00:15:35,565 --> 00:15:38,500
Speaker 0: I just found a video how to make fireworks great.

271
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:40,186
Speaker 0: Also, you know what's on YouTube?

272
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:48,260
Speaker 0: a whole bunch of World War two in Vietnam War era Military instructional videos on how to make and use munitions in war.

273
00:15:49,023 --> 00:15:55,994
Speaker 0: I watched a video a few weeks ago on like how to use claymores How to make 17th century artillery.

274
00:15:56,236 --> 00:16:00,640
Speaker 0: Yeah Claymores is in the modern weapons not claymores as in the big swords.

275
00:16:00,821 --> 00:16:05,923
Speaker 0: But I did also watch a video on how to use the old claymores how to use not how to make More.

276
00:16:06,447 --> 00:16:07,877
Speaker 1: I watch one and use an old-fashioned.

277
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:11,932
Speaker 0: I watched one instructional video on how to make improvised weapons.

278
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:14,440
Speaker 0: Okay, and it was a US government video.

279
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:19,700
Speaker 1: So I saw a guy talking about like making a weapon out of like a newspaper, uh hard drug use or creation.

280
00:16:19,861 --> 00:16:21,346
Speaker 0: So I've been following this channel.

281
00:16:21,386 --> 00:16:25,200
Speaker 0: That is literally this dude takes every drug and talks about it at length.

282
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:27,508
Speaker 1: So YouTube is not enforcing any of these rules.

283
00:16:27,688 --> 00:16:29,214
Speaker 0: eating disorders complaining about.

284
00:16:29,254 --> 00:16:31,120
Speaker 1: YouTube not enforcing its hate speech rules.

285
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:36,978
Speaker 1: But what basically is happening is YouTube isn't enforcing any of its hate speech is not listed in any of these categories.

286
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:45,860
Speaker 1: that I'm looking right, but also YouTube did I guess arbitrarily enforce its no hacking rule on this one video from this one guy and created a big uproar.

287
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,155
Speaker 1: and Then when the guy complained, I think they took down his whole channel, right?

288
00:16:49,457 --> 00:16:49,678
Speaker 1: Yeah.

289
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:50,541
Speaker 1: Yeah it was like.

290
00:16:50,922 --> 00:16:57,679
Speaker 1: so this random not good enforcement hit someone who made a big stink and now everyone's focusing on it

291
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:02,880
Speaker 0: and All they would had to do is frame it as here is a documentary of this zero-day exploit

292
00:17:03,101 --> 00:17:03,362
Speaker 1: Yep,

293
00:17:03,683 --> 00:17:06,334
Speaker 0: and then it would probably well, I don't even know

294
00:17:06,394 --> 00:17:07,598
Speaker 1: play some artistic music.

295
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:19,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, let me teach you how the zero-day exploit was discovered Yep, so in some other news there was actually a pretty big deal breach in Japan.

296
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:23,795
Speaker 1: So speaking of reaches now to steal money, let's make a YouTube video.

297
00:17:23,835 --> 00:17:24,999
Speaker 1: Yeah steal money from 7-eleven.

298
00:17:26,364 --> 00:17:35,653
Speaker 0: In my professional experience and I will not go into details on this but In my entire professional experience going back like 15 or so years.

299
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:44,380
Speaker 0: The one thing that has been pretty consistent is that Japanese firms tend to have poor IT security.

300
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:49,720
Speaker 1: That's not surprising from a country that is like still uses a lot of cash, right?

301
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:55,200
Speaker 0: Yeah Like that has been a theme in my entire adult professional life and I will leave it at that.

302
00:17:55,862 --> 00:18:04,477
Speaker 0: So the other thing you need to know is that if you I'm about to talk about 7-eleven and if you live in the United States 7-eleven is a place to be avoided at all costs.

303
00:18:04,578 --> 00:18:10,077
Speaker 1: indeed 7-eleven like unless you are desperate for a sad-ass hot dog.

304
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:13,768
Speaker 1: There's nothing else like 7-eleven is a quickie.

305
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:16,440
Speaker 1: my things there that come in a package that are okay.

306
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:22,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you go to a 7-eleven when you really need a Red Bull at like 11 o'clock at night.

307
00:18:22,188 --> 00:18:31,586
Speaker 1: Yeah, or if you're at a convention, it's the only thing nearby Yeah, and you need band-aids, but like the food in a 7-eleven It's below the line.

308
00:18:31,726 --> 00:18:39,160
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like the floor in a 7-eleven is perpetually sticky and grimy I think even if you're poor you're going to the bodega to get a quarter water.

309
00:18:39,281 --> 00:18:40,687
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know where 7-elevens thrive in the u.s.

310
00:18:43,941 --> 00:18:47,010
Speaker 0: Where they're the area is too poor to even have a proper bodega.

311
00:18:47,351 --> 00:18:48,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, they only have chains.

312
00:18:48,515 --> 00:18:49,999
Speaker 0: They're like outside of.

313
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:54,986
Speaker 1: If you're not in a major city, you're not gonna have a bodega You're only gonna have a 7-eleven.

314
00:18:55,207 --> 00:18:55,789
Speaker 0: in Japan.

315
00:18:55,809 --> 00:18:57,536
Speaker 0: 7-elevens are the fucking shit.

316
00:18:57,577 --> 00:18:58,380
Speaker 1: They are fucking awesome.

317
00:18:58,621 --> 00:19:00,628
Speaker 0: Oh, they're amazing in other places too.

318
00:19:00,648 --> 00:19:01,350
Speaker 0: Like in Hong Kong.

319
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:04,260
Speaker 0: I had lunch in 7-eleven like three times.

320
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, why not?

321
00:19:05,866 --> 00:19:06,448
Speaker 0: It was great.

322
00:19:06,588 --> 00:19:09,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a really good dumplings actually your ramen fucking right there.

323
00:19:10,081 --> 00:19:11,708
Speaker 1: But in Japan, that's only the beginning.

324
00:19:11,748 --> 00:19:21,051
Speaker 0: that's like, you know, not only is 7-eleven great But 7-eleven is also a lot of people's Bank Mmm, like banking happens at 7-eleven.

325
00:19:21,091 --> 00:19:23,681
Speaker 0: like you buy train tickets at the 7-eleven It's.

326
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:32,192
Speaker 0: they're like there was a time when 7-eleven was like the only place a foreign ATE Like the only place you could use a foreign debit card to get cash.

327
00:19:32,232 --> 00:19:34,040
Speaker 1: now some of this it's like in America.

328
00:19:34,321 --> 00:19:36,091
Speaker 1: There is a lot of this stuff happening.

329
00:19:36,131 --> 00:19:37,660
Speaker 1: We're like a store that does everything.

330
00:19:37,941 --> 00:19:39,226
Speaker 1: Yeah, like we could buy.

331
00:19:39,246 --> 00:19:50,160
Speaker 0: I remember when I was a kid we would pay the electric bill at like this gas station Dude, we would go to the Meijer which was a grocery store gas station appliance store like home improvement store.

332
00:19:50,461 --> 00:19:57,443
Speaker 1: I think you might actually be surprised like at the number of services that places near you are offering that you are not aware of Or using.

333
00:19:57,846 --> 00:20:06,380
Speaker 1: but it seems like in other countries like Japan for instance People are aware of the incredible wide variety of services that places like 7-eleven offer and use them.

334
00:20:06,681 --> 00:20:10,900
Speaker 0: There is a class based and societal based nuance to that in the u.s.

335
00:20:11,422 --> 00:20:18,529
Speaker 0: Most of the places like those kinds of services that are not at banks are used by poor people are Not only not just used by poor people.

336
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:22,089
Speaker 0: They're usually exploitative and Target poor people.

337
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:23,820
Speaker 0: there's there's a nuance there.

338
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,023
Speaker 0: But that nuance is important.

339
00:20:25,485 --> 00:20:32,730
Speaker 0: like if you're doing your banking at the 7-eleven in the US or the Western Union in the US It's because you are marginalized.

340
00:20:32,810 --> 00:20:33,916
Speaker 0: Yes most of the time.

341
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:41,180
Speaker 0: So anyway 7-eleven has a mobile payment system that they launched so people can have a phone app that'll spit out a barcode.

342
00:20:41,301 --> 00:20:42,291
Speaker 1: So like Apple pay?

343
00:20:42,412 --> 00:20:43,219
Speaker 0: yeah like Apple pay.

344
00:20:43,461 --> 00:20:47,798
Speaker 1: Okay, so you guys you give them your money to 7-eleven and deposit it in 7-eleven.

345
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:51,820
Speaker 1: They open an app on your phone and it shows a code.

346
00:20:52,121 --> 00:21:04,320
Speaker 1: You scan it at a register and that register takes from your 7-eleven account the amount of money that you're required to pay for Whatever you're buying basically and then your account go decreases at 7-eleven and you can like tie different debit cards to it.

347
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:05,448
Speaker 0: Like I can't read Japanese.

348
00:21:05,468 --> 00:21:08,404
Speaker 0: I don't know all the details of how it all worked But pretty simple thing.

349
00:21:08,424 --> 00:21:11,292
Speaker 1: something along those lines close if not exactly.

350
00:21:11,473 --> 00:21:13,358
Speaker 0: it was launched on July 1st.

351
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,247
Speaker 1: That wasn't very long ago.

352
00:21:15,267 --> 00:21:16,373
Speaker 1: That was seven.

353
00:21:16,394 --> 00:21:17,359
Speaker 1: That was one week ago.

354
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:21,472
Speaker 0: It was immediately hacked to the tune of half a million dollars.

355
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:24,020
Speaker 0: They shut it down immediately and now it's fucked.

356
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:34,602
Speaker 1: All right, so and this is why it's amazing million dollars isn't a lot of money for such a big company A lot of money for people to have it stolen from them and it's also a lot of money I guess.

357
00:21:34,642 --> 00:21:36,674
Speaker 1: does Japan have like an FDIC equivalent?

358
00:21:36,694 --> 00:21:37,780
Speaker 1: I'm assuming there was no insurance.

359
00:21:38,142 --> 00:21:45,175
Speaker 0: funnily enough at work yesterday or last week I was actually reading a lot about because there's a.

360
00:21:45,195 --> 00:21:46,040
Speaker 1: there's I see.

361
00:21:46,762 --> 00:22:01,532
Speaker 0: So I know a lot about like US financial regulatory agencies and bodies and I know a lot about European regulatory bodies like in the US there's a ATS is like an ATS is like so an alternative trading system.

362
00:22:01,653 --> 00:22:04,220
Speaker 0: Okay, so sometimes you trade on like an exchange.

363
00:22:04,401 --> 00:22:08,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then you might trade on something that isn't actually an exchange.

364
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:12,980
Speaker 0: All right, but is regulated similarly to an exchange but is right but is also regulated differently.

365
00:22:13,262 --> 00:22:18,556
Speaker 1: So like I make something that lets you trade stocks I could just make something you can and I let the SEC know about it.

366
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,024
Speaker 1: and they say okay You're following all these rules.

367
00:22:20,065 --> 00:22:23,040
Speaker 0: and I say yeah, basically and it's not actually the FTC in this case.

368
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,194
Speaker 0: But I digress let's not get into that in Europe.

369
00:22:26,235 --> 00:22:27,380
Speaker 0: There's a similar thing.

370
00:22:28,202 --> 00:22:30,973
Speaker 0: There's a similar thing, but it's not an ATS.

371
00:22:31,134 --> 00:22:36,424
Speaker 0: It's called an MTF a multilateral trading Forget whatever.

372
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:48,019
Speaker 0: Anyway, I was trying to figure out what the fuck those are and how they're regulated anywhere on earth other than the US and the EU and that is actually really hard to find out.

373
00:22:48,039 --> 00:23:00,020
Speaker 0: and I was able to figure out that Japan has regulations around it But I cannot find equivalent relevant regulations in like China or Singapore or other countries in in East Asia.

374
00:23:00,622 --> 00:23:02,551
Speaker 0: Anyway, that was that was me today.

375
00:23:02,611 --> 00:23:04,720
Speaker 0: I was reading Wikipedia at work to figure something out.

376
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:07,688
Speaker 0: All right, so I don't know what Japan's like it like.

377
00:23:08,129 --> 00:23:13,163
Speaker 0: regulatory models are around this but the fact that they were hacked Not that interesting.

378
00:23:13,604 --> 00:23:18,015
Speaker 0: the egregious security failing like it is so egregious.

379
00:23:18,035 --> 00:23:20,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is like didn't even try.

380
00:23:21,205 --> 00:23:24,346
Speaker 0: They basically do hack this.

381
00:23:24,707 --> 00:23:30,326
Speaker 0: all you had to do was know someone's email address and Reset their account.

382
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:32,560
Speaker 0: Okay, and then now it's yours.

383
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:33,845
Speaker 1: How did you get the?

384
00:23:34,026 --> 00:23:37,740
Speaker 1: they're like you didn't have to like actually get an email with a link in it.

385
00:23:37,820 --> 00:23:39,166
Speaker 0: So here's what you need.

386
00:23:39,488 --> 00:23:42,020
Speaker 0: You need to know the user's date of birth.

387
00:23:42,321 --> 00:23:46,497
Speaker 0: Okay, the email address and their phone number and you just lets you reset.

388
00:23:46,537 --> 00:23:51,069
Speaker 1: right in the app Send any confirmation to the email or the phone number.

389
00:23:51,390 --> 00:23:54,759
Speaker 0: it asks you what email address you'd like the password to be sent to.

390
00:23:56,072 --> 00:24:04,082
Speaker 0: great Even better you didn't actually even need to know their birthday Because they don't require you to put in a birthday You can.

391
00:24:04,122 --> 00:24:06,793
Speaker 0: if you don't put one in it defaults it to January 1st 2019.

392
00:24:06,793 --> 00:24:07,134
Speaker 0: It just works.

393
00:24:08,702 --> 00:24:19,180
Speaker 0: So basically matter what part that you put in hackers immediately Just attack this Just with scatter attacks and it immediately made as many charges as they could.

394
00:24:19,901 --> 00:24:23,650
Speaker 0: All right, like that is egregious to the point of malfeasance.

395
00:24:23,891 --> 00:24:27,700
Speaker 1: It's not even hacking really, you know based on your it's just like.

396
00:24:28,921 --> 00:24:30,084
Speaker 1: It's just like okay.

397
00:24:30,164 --> 00:24:34,035
Speaker 1: If everyone's password is a I just log in with everyone's account like it.

398
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:34,636
Speaker 0: what's like?

399
00:24:35,519 --> 00:24:42,826
Speaker 0: on one hand I don't want to blame the victim but the victim here like as you know, the victim here is not 7-eleven 7-eleven customer.

400
00:24:42,846 --> 00:24:46,303
Speaker 1: the customers who had their accounts emptied like The.

401
00:24:46,544 --> 00:24:56,840
Speaker 0: everyone involved in building the system should be charged with crimes Like this is this is pathetic that is crime worthy and it's a negligence.

402
00:24:57,101 --> 00:25:01,413
Speaker 1: I mean at the very least there should be a class-action lawsuit by the people who had accounts.

403
00:25:02,075 --> 00:25:04,269
Speaker 0: and there's even a thing in Japan I don't know.

404
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:04,776
Speaker 0: I don't know.

405
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:07,670
Speaker 0: Equivalent, I guess like not in the u.s.

406
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:08,654
Speaker 1: That's what would happen.

407
00:25:08,775 --> 00:25:13,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I Or forced arbitration.

408
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:16,317
Speaker 1: just this kind of this is why you shouldn't agree to forced arbitration.

409
00:25:16,498 --> 00:25:20,071
Speaker 0: Yep ever In some other news you probably saw this.

410
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:24,398
Speaker 0: it's hard to find unbiased reporting about this.

411
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,305
Speaker 1: I just want to say about this story.

412
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:53,360
Speaker 1: This is a thing that happens a lot these days where something outrageous or seemingly outrageous happens to a single or a very small number of customers or users of a certain thing and That thing becomes a big story and the journalists find like a couple other examples of it happening and then they make a headline Like so-and-so does this to all their customers all their users?

413
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:06,326
Speaker 1: They're evil my god because of small or even a single Person has an anecdote that is seems outrageous or bad And Some it goes both ways right.

414
00:26:06,367 --> 00:26:08,593
Speaker 1: sometimes it is and sometimes it isn't.

415
00:26:08,654 --> 00:26:12,866
Speaker 0: but in this case all I'm gonna say is I'm gonna report on this as best I can.

416
00:26:13,227 --> 00:26:30,580
Speaker 0: but I found a lot of websites talking about this, but they all had very similar articles written and I'm making quote marks by different people and they all seem to be focused on the single issue of Restaurants don't want to have to deal with grubhub.

417
00:26:31,342 --> 00:26:39,068
Speaker 0: So I feel like there is an industry entity trying to push against grubhub on behalf of Restaurants which we have pro.

418
00:26:39,108 --> 00:26:44,038
Speaker 1: grubhub rim over here may or may not be justified You still owning grubhub stock over there?

419
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:50,080
Speaker 0: So full disclosure, I did own a significant amount of grubhub stock and also full disclosure.

420
00:26:50,583 --> 00:26:53,620
Speaker 0: I sold it all some time ago for a substantial profit.

421
00:26:54,082 --> 00:26:56,754
Speaker 0: I currently own zero grubhub stock, so I got.

422
00:26:56,794 --> 00:27:00,412
Speaker 0: no I got no horse in this race And I also disclosure.

423
00:27:00,472 --> 00:27:01,600
Speaker 1: we both use grubhub a lot.

424
00:27:01,781 --> 00:27:04,937
Speaker 0: I use grubhub a lot because I'm not calling you on the phone or a pizza.

425
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:07,647
Speaker 1: I use it like maybe three four times a month.

426
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,028
Speaker 0: I use it.

427
00:27:08,068 --> 00:27:12,080
Speaker 0: Maybe one one to one point five times a week got average.

428
00:27:12,361 --> 00:27:15,420
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I think you say month and but no he's a way more than me.

429
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:17,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, we order by order in at least once a week.

430
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,080
Speaker 1: Okay, I do maybe once a week, you know.

431
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,720
Speaker 0: But in some week zero, I think part of the difference is there's two of us.

432
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,738
Speaker 0: So it's more bang for our buck if we order in.

433
00:27:25,261 --> 00:27:28,700
Speaker 0: It's like maybe ordering Indian food for one is two nights worth of Indian.

434
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:29,222
Speaker 0: That's right.

435
00:27:29,422 --> 00:27:33,937
Speaker 0: ordering Indian food for two is either two nights of Indian food or one night of Indian food.

436
00:27:33,997 --> 00:27:42,920
Speaker 0: like it works out Mmm, so the story that you saw was grubhub created fake webs restaurant websites to screw restaurants over.

437
00:27:43,389 --> 00:27:49,649
Speaker 1: Okay The speaking of which if you don't realize grubhub does sort of screw restaurants over Away.

438
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:51,858
Speaker 1: if you're a restaurant It's like alright.

439
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:57,420
Speaker 1: Nobody who's buying food to get delivery online is gonna find you if you're not on grubhub.

440
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,988
Speaker 1: So it's like you need to be on there.

441
00:27:59,029 --> 00:28:01,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know restaurants on grubhub.

442
00:28:01,261 --> 00:28:06,587
Speaker 1: I don't search elsewhere and then see if you try to make your own Website or be listed on some other thing.

443
00:28:06,607 --> 00:28:08,032
Speaker 1: if you're not grubhub or seamless.

444
00:28:08,233 --> 00:28:10,280
Speaker 1: It's like people aren't really gonna find your restaurant.

445
00:28:10,321 --> 00:28:11,660
Speaker 1: They're gonna order from your competitor.

446
00:28:11,941 --> 00:28:17,160
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get a lot of deliveries unless people know your restaurant and even then if they know your restaurant.

447
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:20,420
Speaker 1: They'll probably search for on grubhub and not on Google and it's like it's you know.

448
00:28:20,702 --> 00:28:22,619
Speaker 1: But the problem is is how do they screw you over?

449
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:27,856
Speaker 1: They screw you over because they know they're the only game in town and they charge like a 30% ridiculous fee.

450
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,802
Speaker 1: So it's like you pay the restaurant $30 groves taking like $10.

451
00:28:32,802 --> 00:28:36,217
Speaker 1: Yep, right the restaurants do not make a lot of money when you buy and grow up up.

452
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:36,900
Speaker 1: You should tip them.

453
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:44,815
Speaker 0: Well, you know what I do my policy because just the way things are in New York in particular I tip grubhub delivery people at the rate.

454
00:28:44,915 --> 00:28:45,960
Speaker 0: I would tip at a restaurant.

455
00:28:46,161 --> 00:28:51,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do too cuz yeah, so a waiter a waiter just came in like delivered basically what I do.

456
00:28:51,300 --> 00:29:00,779
Speaker 1: This dude was on a motor like on an electric bike going the wrong way Reloaded percentage buttons, I push the one farthest to the right.

457
00:29:01,623 --> 00:29:06,506
Speaker 0: I do 20 ish percent because I figure if you're on a bicycle Yeah, this to the right.

458
00:29:06,707 --> 00:29:13,800
Speaker 1: if you're on the bicycle in the rain delivering me pizza and like you're in the rain I put I go beyond if it's raining or snowing or something.

459
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:21,008
Speaker 1: You deserve a real tip and I try also try not to order in those situations to begin with only if I really have to Yeah, and if I really have to I'd leave a big tip.

460
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:23,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, but basically here's the deal as best I can tell.

461
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:32,092
Speaker 0: I'm gonna link to two things because on one hand the second article link to is how to avoid grubhub, but Honestly replace grubhub with Amazon.

462
00:29:32,173 --> 00:29:33,340
Speaker 0: It's the exact same conversation.

463
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:40,377
Speaker 0: Amazon is problematic for everyone except Amazon and the consumer.

464
00:29:41,163 --> 00:29:42,149
Speaker 0: Grubhub is the same way.

465
00:29:42,471 --> 00:29:46,266
Speaker 0: ordering before grubhub Ordering from restaurants sucked.

466
00:29:46,567 --> 00:29:50,079
Speaker 0: Yep, and outside of New York City ordering from restaurants sucks.

467
00:29:51,262 --> 00:30:00,959
Speaker 0: But basically what grubhub was doing is if you make an account with grubhub They would not only like set up the thing to let you order food, but they would make websites.

468
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:03,709
Speaker 0: That I have basically like.

469
00:30:03,749 --> 00:30:06,880
Speaker 0: it's a website for your restaurant that is integrated with grubhub.

470
00:30:07,224 --> 00:30:12,040
Speaker 1: So if someone finds that website Someone were to Google for you know rims chicken shack.

471
00:30:12,483 --> 00:30:15,118
Speaker 1: They would find a standalone website for rims chicken shack.

472
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:28,640
Speaker 1: but is actually a grubhub powered website that would allow them to browse your menu and Order from rims chicken shack directly from rims chicken shack comm yep without having in case they googled instead of going to grubhub first.

473
00:30:29,181 --> 00:30:43,980
Speaker 1: And on the one hand that's good because you didn't maybe didn't have a website right and now people are Finding your website if they finding your restaurant if they happen to search Google Instead of grubhub and they're placing an order with you, so that's helpful.

474
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:47,520
Speaker 1: It's not helpful because what if you do have a website?

475
00:30:48,101 --> 00:30:53,101
Speaker 1: This is actually a you already have your own rims chicken shack website that allows non grubhub Ordering.

476
00:30:53,282 --> 00:30:55,268
Speaker 1: that doesn't have this big cut taken out.

477
00:30:55,308 --> 00:31:03,720
Speaker 1: if anyone happens to order there someone googles for rims chicken shack and in Above rims chicken shack in the search results is this website made by grubhub.

478
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:12,825
Speaker 1: Someone clicks on that thinking instead of the second one and basically because they click that link instead of the other one rims losing like $10

479
00:31:12,825 --> 00:31:25,256
Speaker 0: yep, but at the same time if someone clicks on the real website Then they're gonna have to order direct from the restaurant which in my experience Usually doesn't work because most restaurant owners have a garbage website that no one maintains.

480
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:25,838
Speaker 0: that doesn't work.

481
00:31:25,918 --> 00:31:26,400
Speaker 1: that is true.

482
00:31:26,581 --> 00:31:32,428
Speaker 0: I have literally ordered from restaurants before where no food came And I called them and they were like what?

483
00:31:32,910 --> 00:31:35,220
Speaker 0: like they didn't know you could order online from their website.

484
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:40,560
Speaker 1: I've had that happen to me, but for example Burger Club over here in Astoria right they have their own website.

485
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:42,266
Speaker 1: It's powered by some kind of software.

486
00:31:42,326 --> 00:31:43,029
Speaker 1: They've installed.

487
00:31:43,169 --> 00:31:46,100
Speaker 1: It's I guess like a WordPress equivalent for restaurants.

488
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,924
Speaker 1: I forget what it's called.

489
00:31:46,964 --> 00:31:47,767
Speaker 1: It's some kind of thing.

490
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:55,672
Speaker 1: so if you order directly from Burger Club's website It does not go through grubhub Yep, and the price is slightly cheaper and the restaurant gets a lot more money.

491
00:31:55,873 --> 00:31:59,706
Speaker 1: so and if you order from grubhub It's like it's the same exact menu.

492
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:03,700
Speaker 1: the prices are a little bit more expensive and the restaurant gets way less money.

493
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:11,456
Speaker 0: So what's sad is personally I have there are some restaurants around here that have their own website to order from and it's the same Deal is slightly cheaper.

494
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:22,044
Speaker 0: Kind of like how I'm unwilling to launch any Application other than steam to buy games not really willing to go to a website and log in with a separate credential to order food Even if it's cheaper.

495
00:32:22,465 --> 00:32:23,189
Speaker 1: I only it's.

496
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:25,520
Speaker 1: the only reason is because then it had to make credential.

497
00:32:25,681 --> 00:32:26,786
Speaker 1: It lets me log in with Google.

498
00:32:27,369 --> 00:32:28,354
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not bad.

499
00:32:28,756 --> 00:32:37,220
Speaker 0: That's actually pretty good Yeah, but so one thing that might be happening here, too Is that grubhub's website the one they make for the restaurant is?

500
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:43,420
Speaker 0: Probably better and more linked to than the actual restaurants website because who links to a restaurant's website.

501
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,240
Speaker 0: There's gonna be no SEO like there's good Google.

502
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:50,375
Speaker 0: There's gonna be no Google juice for the website restaurant unless you're searching Google Maps.

503
00:32:51,037 --> 00:32:51,800
Speaker 0: That's just how it is.

504
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one's linking to your crappy restaurants website on a regular basis.

505
00:32:56,041 --> 00:32:56,302
Speaker 0: So

506
00:32:56,624 --> 00:33:01,491
Speaker 1: unless you're happen to be that one restaurant is really good at internet which may be this one that started this story is I

507
00:33:01,993 --> 00:33:10,200
Speaker 0: don't think so because Basically, I'm reading into this but I'm not gonna explain the details of the lawsuit because that is way too much to talk

508
00:33:10,220 --> 00:33:10,320
Speaker 1: about.

509
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:11,006
Speaker 1: It's actually a lawsuit.

510
00:33:11,026 --> 00:33:12,195
Speaker 1: I didn't know that there's a lawsuit.

511
00:33:12,276 --> 00:33:20,220
Speaker 0: Okay Alleging that the company bills restaurants for commission fees when calls are made through the number because grubhub those websites also provide phone numbers.

512
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:23,117
Speaker 0: You can call where a human will take the order through.

513
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:23,660
Speaker 0: for grubhub.

514
00:33:25,721 --> 00:33:27,949
Speaker 0: The lawsuit is claiming you've been just like.

515
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:30,298
Speaker 1: go to grubhub and type in the info.

516
00:33:30,438 --> 00:33:30,940
Speaker 0: why not?

517
00:33:31,000 --> 00:33:33,308
Speaker 0: That's what I would do.

518
00:33:33,328 --> 00:33:34,272
Speaker 1: call someone on the phone.

519
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:36,680
Speaker 1: They go to grubhub.com and type in your order for you.

520
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:41,092
Speaker 0: That's some bullshit, but they're claiming that grubhub was taking commission fees.

521
00:33:41,273 --> 00:33:45,649
Speaker 0: Even if those calls did not result in an order That would be some bullshit.

522
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:47,760
Speaker 1: How could you have a commission on a zero dollar?

523
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:54,220
Speaker 0: That's what I don't understand the lawsuit seems to be about other things and not the thing everyone's talking about.

524
00:33:54,361 --> 00:33:54,886
Speaker 0: Interesting.

525
00:33:54,966 --> 00:33:56,419
Speaker 0: So the thing everyone's talking about?

526
00:33:57,501 --> 00:34:02,314
Speaker 0: From what I can tell one grubhub in 2018 stopped offering the service of making these microsites.

527
00:34:02,555 --> 00:34:05,996
Speaker 0: Okay, maybe because this lawsuit, uh No, because no one used them.

528
00:34:06,056 --> 00:34:12,580
Speaker 0: apparently Yeah And - I've never seen one grubhub said in response to this like they've been responding to those articles.

529
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:22,100
Speaker 0: site owners can request that these sites be taken down at any time with no cost or and the ownership of the domains would be Transferred to the restaurant free of charge.

530
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:27,264
Speaker 0: So if you are a restaurant you could say hey give me the domain Grubhub just gives it to you.

531
00:34:27,324 --> 00:34:29,210
Speaker 1: grubhub just registered a domain for you.

532
00:34:29,331 --> 00:34:33,849
Speaker 0: point it point this domain that has a shit ton of Google juice at your real website.

533
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:35,175
Speaker 0: You just win.

534
00:34:35,195 --> 00:34:38,106
Speaker 0: I Think what's happening here?

535
00:34:38,206 --> 00:34:41,659
Speaker 0: And this is just me guessing based on my interactions with people in this industry.

536
00:34:42,523 --> 00:34:46,819
Speaker 0: Is that the restaurants who are complaining about this the most don't?

537
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:51,473
Speaker 0: Understand how to use a domain that they are given like?

538
00:34:51,533 --> 00:35:03,694
Speaker 0: they don't know how to point this domain at Their website because their website was either made by their cousin's younger brother Or was made by a fly-by-night consulting company and they don't know how to update it.

539
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:05,880
Speaker 0: That is how most restaurant websites are.

540
00:35:06,665 --> 00:35:07,270
Speaker 0: There's a lot.

541
00:35:07,310 --> 00:35:08,580
Speaker 0: you can read all these details.

542
00:35:08,741 --> 00:35:15,947
Speaker 0: But all I'm saying is when you see these stories of grubhub creating fake websites for restaurants There's always a lot more to the story.

543
00:35:16,308 --> 00:35:24,566
Speaker 0: and if you see a lot of articles talking about the same thing that use very very similar copy Look into it a little bit deeper.

544
00:35:24,667 --> 00:35:26,353
Speaker 0: There's probably something else going on.

545
00:35:26,393 --> 00:35:31,097
Speaker 0: The real issue is that No one wants to go to more than one website to buy things.

546
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:41,557
Speaker 0: news 11 So in some last really light news before we get into the main bit There is I saw a ton of people talking about this the discord virus.

547
00:35:41,858 --> 00:35:45,680
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Yeah, there's no discord virus, okay, here's what's going on.

548
00:35:47,242 --> 00:35:50,820
Speaker 0: Some people are sending malicious links to other people via discord chats.

549
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:55,540
Speaker 1: You open discord you go to some server you have a link that goes to some meet malware site.

550
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:58,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, send the link to someone and they stupidly click on.

551
00:35:58,375 --> 00:36:01,709
Speaker 1: they stupidly click on it And then yes people are more likely to click on a links.

552
00:36:01,850 --> 00:36:05,225
Speaker 1: if you send someone a link via email the spam filter gets it And no one clicks on it.

553
00:36:05,245 --> 00:36:07,680
Speaker 1: You send someone a link a shady link on discord.

554
00:36:07,821 --> 00:36:21,018
Speaker 0: Well, they click it but even then you go to this website It's shady and then you type in all your credentials again and give it access to your discord And then you're aft and your discord is ruined forever and hackers steal it and spam your friends.

555
00:36:21,198 --> 00:36:30,100
Speaker 0: and it's a thing That's been happening a lot apparently One all I'm gonna say I'm not gonna dwell on this not even talk about the details not even a link directly to any article.

556
00:36:30,181 --> 00:36:31,008
Speaker 1: Not a virus.

557
00:36:31,452 --> 00:36:32,239
Speaker 0: It's not a virus.

558
00:36:33,482 --> 00:36:34,909
Speaker 0: If you fall for this, you're dumb.

559
00:36:34,929 --> 00:36:42,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, but more importantly This is happening a lot and it worries me because basically people are morons.

560
00:36:43,181 --> 00:36:45,247
Speaker 0: People older than us fall for fishing a lot.

561
00:36:45,708 --> 00:37:03,588
Speaker 0: people our age fall for it less for reasons that I don't want to get into now But I'm seeing people younger than us like they get the Russian bot thing Like they can recognize when like there's a Russian bot posting on their Facebook wall or tweeting at them like they get it But they don't understand fishing.

562
00:37:04,070 --> 00:37:08,315
Speaker 0: like they're falling for this ridiculous fishing stuff again And it's happening a lot.

563
00:37:08,396 --> 00:37:10,704
Speaker 1: Let's go Teach a man to fish.

564
00:37:11,146 --> 00:37:14,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, should we just make a fishing site that deletes your account?

565
00:37:14,636 --> 00:37:15,820
Speaker 1: Just quit my job become fisherman.

566
00:37:18,031 --> 00:37:25,730
Speaker 0: So Yeah, if you fall for this like I don't know my condolences Learn how to spot babies first fishing.

567
00:37:26,011 --> 00:37:28,040
Speaker 0: These are not even sophisticated attacks.

568
00:37:28,302 --> 00:37:29,730
Speaker 0: These are literally like I looked.

569
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,419
Speaker 0: I clicked on one of these links to see the deal.

570
00:37:32,062 --> 00:37:37,038
Speaker 0: This is literally the equivalent of those aim fishing attacks from like the 90s.

571
00:37:38,547 --> 00:37:39,778
Speaker 0: So what's old is new?

572
00:37:45,990 --> 00:37:48,738
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day what he got.

573
00:37:49,219 --> 00:37:50,824
Speaker 1: so it's for the July weekend.

574
00:37:50,884 --> 00:37:59,444
Speaker 1: for July weekend in America America You tend to have a barbecue which is not bar You know, usually not barbecue of the you know, the kind you get at a barbecue.

575
00:37:59,464 --> 00:38:03,560
Speaker 1: right when Americans say barbecue We mean we mean grilling some hot dogs and hamburgers.

576
00:38:03,600 --> 00:38:06,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, we also say barbecue when we mean ribs.

577
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:09,782
Speaker 1: But we also say barbecue and we mean grill some hot dogs and hamburgers.

578
00:38:09,802 --> 00:38:10,023
Speaker 0: Don't judge.

579
00:38:10,043 --> 00:38:12,010
Speaker 0: That's just how the English language is in the US.

580
00:38:12,311 --> 00:38:14,380
Speaker 1: Yes, that's how American English is whatever.

581
00:38:14,441 --> 00:38:22,424
Speaker 1: But yeah, the hot dog and hamburger style of barbecue Grilling also involves often nice deserty or you know, sort of side dish.

582
00:38:22,705 --> 00:38:24,068
Speaker 1: You cut up a big old watermelon.

583
00:38:24,309 --> 00:38:26,515
Speaker 1: tastes great It's watermelon season.

584
00:38:26,555 --> 00:38:27,156
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

585
00:38:27,317 --> 00:38:27,939
Speaker 1: Right?

586
00:38:27,959 --> 00:38:28,922
Speaker 1: So here you go.

587
00:38:28,962 --> 00:38:29,624
Speaker 1: This is guy.

588
00:38:29,644 --> 00:38:31,870
Speaker 1: I just discovered his YouTube channel.

589
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:37,290
Speaker 1: I'm sure other people have been following it for quite a while cuz it's got five fucking million plus views on this video.

590
00:38:38,352 --> 00:38:43,450
Speaker 1: I was like trending something on YouTube, but in case you haven't seen it turtle loves watermelon.

591
00:38:43,550 --> 00:38:58,070
Speaker 1: This is guy called the fish whisperer and he's got a little pond or whatever he hangs out at and he's got some turtle friends and the fish friends and They love him and he keeps going to feed him and take care of him and he does other videos on here.

592
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,049
Speaker 1: He made special popsicles for the turtles.

593
00:39:00,574 --> 00:39:04,336
Speaker 1: He's just like these turtles are getting like You know really sweet life.

594
00:39:04,457 --> 00:39:11,655
Speaker 1: Thanks to this guy who comes over and takes care of them all the time and gives them sweet shit And everyone loves cute turtles.

595
00:39:12,317 --> 00:39:13,019
Speaker 1: So here you go.

596
00:39:13,199 --> 00:39:13,741
Speaker 0: It's good stuff.

597
00:39:14,363 --> 00:39:24,090
Speaker 0: So in another cute and possibly antifa video so Cockatoos are terrifyingly smart like parrots are in general.

598
00:39:25,012 --> 00:39:32,171
Speaker 1: That's the white bird that's like fans out all its feathers like yeah And I'm a fan of cockatoos like the ones on its head, too like.

599
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:48,150
Speaker 0: but this is pretty amazing because cockatoos are real smart and there are many kinds of cockatoos, but some cockatoos are Thriving in a world where they coexist with humans like they coexist with humans and they figure our shit out.

600
00:39:49,374 --> 00:39:56,963
Speaker 0: And that's a problem because unlike say squirrels trying to steal my food Cockatoos can be as smart as a like two to two and a half year old human.

601
00:39:57,425 --> 00:39:57,545
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

602
00:39:57,947 --> 00:39:58,870
Speaker 0: That is trouble.

603
00:39:59,131 --> 00:40:05,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I was spent the weekend in the presence of a not even two year old human who could you know Open a door.

604
00:40:05,874 --> 00:40:09,525
Speaker 1: Yeah or point at things grab stuff, right?

605
00:40:09,686 --> 00:40:11,050
Speaker 1: You know, it's like oh shit.

606
00:40:11,130 --> 00:40:15,149
Speaker 1: That's somewhat more intelligent than I thought that a child that old would be.

607
00:40:15,531 --> 00:40:23,376
Speaker 0: So a thing that people do in places like Australia is they will put anti bird spikes on Surfaces to keep birds away.

608
00:40:23,436 --> 00:40:26,126
Speaker 1: It's not just people doing Australia's and people do everywhere.

609
00:40:26,267 --> 00:40:27,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Australia It's a pretty good.

610
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:34,936
Speaker 1: So it's very common because hostile architecture for against humans and animals in New York You see for pigeons all the time like.

611
00:40:35,498 --> 00:40:38,790
Speaker 1: it's funny because you see a place like pigeon is pigeon shit everywhere.

612
00:40:38,870 --> 00:40:45,933
Speaker 1: There's clearly a whole ton of pigeons hanging out here shitting all over and you see spikes all over the fucking everything and there's still Pigeon shit everywhere.

613
00:40:46,094 --> 00:40:48,040
Speaker 0: So this video is a cockatoo.

614
00:40:48,441 --> 00:41:07,750
Speaker 0: very methodically with purpose and malice of forethought is Dismantling and Discarding the bird the anti bird spikes and you watch it and you're like, okay the bird is removing these spikes But then the video zooms down and you see that the bird has been at it all day.

615
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:08,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, they is.

616
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:11,565
Speaker 1: remove the spikes from like the vast majority of the fence.

617
00:41:11,585 --> 00:41:12,870
Speaker 1: They are all on the ground.

618
00:41:12,910 --> 00:41:16,681
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you just working down the line this birds taking one for the team.

619
00:41:17,002 --> 00:41:18,788
Speaker 0: This bird is a bird hero.

620
00:41:19,089 --> 00:41:26,036
Speaker 0: Yep In the moment the geekiness book club book is still pages of Getting I was on my to-do list.

621
00:41:26,076 --> 00:41:26,417
Speaker 1: I forget.

622
00:41:26,999 --> 00:41:32,660
Speaker 1: the book club book is the first novel ever written in recorded human history.

623
00:41:33,102 --> 00:41:42,253
Speaker 1: the tale of Genji Beginning then next we're gonna read the second novel in Is not as older.

624
00:41:42,414 --> 00:41:48,781
Speaker 0: I think That's more an oral storytelling.

625
00:41:48,801 --> 00:41:50,108
Speaker 1: I think it is not a novel.

626
00:41:50,128 --> 00:41:50,852
Speaker 0: yeah It's not.

627
00:41:50,872 --> 00:41:51,920
Speaker 0: I don't think it counts as a novel.

628
00:41:51,940 --> 00:41:57,081
Speaker 1: like Homer Homer's Odyssey is much older than the tale of Genji.

629
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:57,483
Speaker 1: It is.

630
00:41:57,583 --> 00:41:59,047
Speaker 1: it is a epic poem.

631
00:41:59,087 --> 00:42:02,197
Speaker 0: It is not a novel Yep, but the tale of Genji.

632
00:42:02,457 --> 00:42:03,521
Speaker 0: I've never actually read it.

633
00:42:03,541 --> 00:42:04,945
Speaker 0: I've only read excerpts from it.

634
00:42:04,985 --> 00:42:10,069
Speaker 1: Make sure you get the unabridged penguin deluxe version.

635
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:17,130
Speaker 1: If you get the abridged one that is not what we are gonna read cuz we don't read abridged shit we are pros.

636
00:42:17,351 --> 00:42:18,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, you play hard mode.

637
00:42:18,778 --> 00:42:20,869
Speaker 0: only we're playing Scrabble unabridged OED.

638
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:23,269
Speaker 1: No We're no baby mode where?

639
00:42:23,890 --> 00:42:31,887
Speaker 0: Scott famously beat me in Scrabble once because he misspelled laser because he wasn't paying attention But it turned out that that misspelling is a word in the OED.

640
00:42:31,907 --> 00:42:32,330
Speaker 1: That's right.

641
00:42:33,153 --> 00:42:36,609
Speaker 0: I was I was I was I was salty shall we say on that day?

642
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:39,019
Speaker 1: That's why Scrabble is not a good game.

643
00:42:39,501 --> 00:42:40,645
Speaker 1: All right, it's a game of memorization.

644
00:42:40,946 --> 00:42:43,336
Speaker 0: Let's talk about oh, yeah And we got no cons till PAX.

645
00:42:43,697 --> 00:42:50,019
Speaker 0: and then PAX West is actually in two weeks, which two months I was about to say I have not finished writing panels.

646
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:55,113
Speaker 1: two months PAX West in Seattle, Seattle Liberty weekend.

647
00:42:55,374 --> 00:42:55,635
Speaker 0: Yep.

648
00:42:56,036 --> 00:42:57,441
Speaker 0: We hopefully will see you there.

649
00:42:57,461 --> 00:43:00,030
Speaker 0: All right, so let's talk about the dark web, right?

650
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,970
Speaker 1: Well, I mean back in the day high level.

651
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:03,659
Speaker 0: We're not going too deep in this right yet.

652
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:20,309
Speaker 1: back in the day in the earlier internet days The late 90s early 2000s, right, you know, you had this internet connection and at least, you know My experience in the 90s was open up AOL Connect and once you're connected you can now run any internet app.

653
00:43:21,191 --> 00:43:22,235
Speaker 1: What shut up Siri?

654
00:43:22,315 --> 00:43:22,737
Speaker 1: you suck.

655
00:43:23,058 --> 00:43:23,520
Speaker 0: How was Scott?

656
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:24,042
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

657
00:43:24,183 --> 00:43:24,564
Speaker 1: I don't know.

658
00:43:24,645 --> 00:43:25,609
Speaker 1: I wasn't even touching my watch.

659
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:29,476
Speaker 1: I don't have Siri.

660
00:43:29,536 --> 00:43:30,319
Speaker 1: I had Siri disabled.

661
00:43:30,499 --> 00:43:32,125
Speaker 0: Well, Siri's always listening.

662
00:43:32,145 --> 00:43:33,350
Speaker 1: I have to do some more disabling.

663
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:35,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically you had access.

664
00:43:35,795 --> 00:43:40,910
Speaker 1: you had an internet connection and then you could run any network application and it would connect.

665
00:43:40,990 --> 00:43:42,522
Speaker 1: So for example, you could run IRC.

666
00:43:42,824 --> 00:43:45,915
Speaker 1: No, you could run Gopher.

667
00:43:46,217 --> 00:43:47,610
Speaker 1: you could run Netscape navigator.

668
00:43:47,731 --> 00:43:54,807
Speaker 0: All you needed to know Ron aim All you needed to know is a DNS name or an IP address and a port number and a protocol.

669
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:55,790
Speaker 1: you could run a video game.

670
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:58,058
Speaker 1: That needed some an internet network play.

671
00:43:58,138 --> 00:44:00,567
Speaker 1: you could run a file sharing program like Napster.

672
00:44:00,627 --> 00:44:01,189
Speaker 1: you can write, you know.

673
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:06,553
Speaker 0: In the days before that you could if you knew the phone number of the BBS you could get in Right deal.

674
00:44:06,674 --> 00:44:09,470
Speaker 1: then there were some that were even more advanced like for example hotline.

675
00:44:09,570 --> 00:44:17,829
Speaker 1: You would run hotline and then you'd have to know the IP address of a hotline server to connect to Right, and then you'd be like, ooh, or you could run a hotline server, you know.

676
00:44:18,292 --> 00:44:19,357
Speaker 1: So it was like.

677
00:44:19,377 --> 00:44:19,679
Speaker 1: there was a

678
00:44:19,719 --> 00:44:20,543
Speaker 0: whole world

679
00:44:20,684 --> 00:44:34,609
Speaker 1: of networking apps Right that used the internet and it was none of it was necessarily dark But it was sort of like, you know, they call it on Wikipedia At least the hidden web or the invisible web where it's like, you know, it's like.

680
00:44:34,629 --> 00:44:35,235
Speaker 1: yeah It's just.

681
00:44:35,276 --> 00:44:36,430
Speaker 1: there's a thing on the internet.

682
00:44:36,450 --> 00:44:43,390
Speaker 1: There are services that servers are providing on the internet Network ports that are open waiting to provide you with data.

683
00:44:43,570 --> 00:44:44,554
Speaker 0: I care to buy apples.

684
00:44:44,794 --> 00:44:59,042
Speaker 1: you must know about them or hear about them from somewhere security through obscure and be intelligent enough or In the know enough to run the software get the software Configure it and connect and to do the thing.

685
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:05,350
Speaker 0: now in the old day before the internet Like when you were doing this with phones, you could kind of war dial and find thing.

686
00:45:05,471 --> 00:45:07,510
Speaker 1: You know the phone number of the thing.

687
00:45:07,650 --> 00:45:12,770
Speaker 0: But if you didn't know the phone number, you could war dial your neighborhood and find the phone number.

688
00:45:12,871 --> 00:45:19,087
Speaker 0: Yeah But then and when we were in high school That was an era of the internet where there weren't really search engines that worked yet.

689
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:19,549
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

690
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:27,010
Speaker 0: So like there were websites unless someone told you how to get there there was no way to know it existed.

691
00:45:27,281 --> 00:45:27,468
Speaker 1: Yep.

692
00:45:27,952 --> 00:45:34,735
Speaker 0: So like for one thing I knew of the IP address of a particular server That rather had quick to like.

693
00:45:34,976 --> 00:45:39,970
Speaker 0: I could type in this IP address and there was a quick to server there with only good people.

694
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:42,298
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm on that same IP address.

695
00:45:42,780 --> 00:45:54,950
Speaker 0: if you in the web browser typed a colon So that IP address colon and a particular port number There was a website there and that website had shall we say things to download?

696
00:45:56,071 --> 00:45:56,402
Speaker 0: Where's?

697
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:02,470
Speaker 0: There were where's there you don't say but cops aren't gonna be able to find that.

698
00:46:02,596 --> 00:46:12,464
Speaker 0: No Unless someone's stupid enough to tell a cop the IP address and the port the cops could never find the place that I downloaded expensive software from in the 90s, right.

699
00:46:13,892 --> 00:46:16,280
Speaker 1: So, you know, this is the way things were.

700
00:46:16,360 --> 00:46:26,810
Speaker 1: but over time people sort of you know Stopped using all these other softwares for the most part and because people just kept making more and more advanced websites and web browsers.

701
00:46:26,890 --> 00:46:33,120
Speaker 1: So it's like oh instead of having your separate Thunderbird email app You now just go to gmail.com in your browser.

702
00:46:33,481 --> 00:46:38,950
Speaker 1: instead of having your separate IRC app You have slack and discord which run in the browser.

703
00:46:39,351 --> 00:46:42,883
Speaker 1: And if you do have these separate standalone slack and discord apps, guess what?

704
00:46:43,124 --> 00:46:44,890
Speaker 1: Those are just web browsers in disguise.

705
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:50,326
Speaker 1: They're literally just Chrome without a location bar at the top and some other slight mods to them.

706
00:46:50,346 --> 00:46:52,774
Speaker 0: and there are apps like Discord.

707
00:46:52,834 --> 00:46:57,210
Speaker 1: and why did you say like that discord app is literally just another copy of Chrome?

708
00:46:57,690 --> 00:46:59,954
Speaker 1: It is not really its own app that is any different.

709
00:46:59,974 --> 00:47:03,942
Speaker 0: but more importantly all these things because of entities like Google.

710
00:47:04,442 --> 00:47:09,333
Speaker 0: they are Google.

711
00:47:09,473 --> 00:47:10,798
Speaker 1: you search and you can find them.

712
00:47:10,918 --> 00:47:12,343
Speaker 1: anything that's web-based.

713
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:17,490
Speaker 0: Yep worldwide web, you know the WWW that you don't type in anymore, right?

714
00:47:18,090 --> 00:47:22,110
Speaker 1: But there are still some things that are on the hidden slash invisible web, right?

715
00:47:22,250 --> 00:47:24,901
Speaker 1: These are things where you search on Google.

716
00:47:24,941 --> 00:47:25,825
Speaker 1: You won't find them.

717
00:47:25,865 --> 00:47:29,003
Speaker 1: You have their website You have to know about right now.

718
00:47:29,023 --> 00:47:36,935
Speaker 0: an IRC server You have to know about but website you have to know about means it probably doesn't have a DNS entry May or may not.

719
00:47:37,136 --> 00:47:41,050
Speaker 0: if it has a DNS entry someone is cataloged that it could still be, you know?

720
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:46,853
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a DNS entry but you got to go to slash slash slash something something something a hidden poor You know.

721
00:47:47,134 --> 00:47:50,249
Speaker 0: crawlers have an economy of scale to find those things.

722
00:47:50,790 --> 00:47:57,466
Speaker 1: Ostensibly it can even be something that worried like yeah, it is indexed by Google But no matter what you search for if it even shows up as a result, it'll be like the 10,000th result.

723
00:47:58,290 --> 00:47:59,749
Speaker 1: No, no one will ever see that link.

724
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:03,630
Speaker 0: There are a lot of parts of the internet that are hard to find but that is not what we were talking about today.

725
00:48:04,253 --> 00:48:07,370
Speaker 1: The dark web is the next level of hidden web.

726
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:10,300
Speaker 0: The dark web is something that has like.

727
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,153
Speaker 1: it is relative read about it in the news a lot and you're like What the hell is that?

728
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:16,842
Speaker 1: It's it's not super new, but it's you know, it's.

729
00:48:17,002 --> 00:48:36,130
Speaker 0: it's new enough like the closest equivalent to the modern dark web are private dark networks that ran proprietary software that were rarely if ever used like Fear like a group of people using waste together could theoretically be like the dark web, right?

730
00:48:36,250 --> 00:48:37,316
Speaker 1: So imagine for a second.

731
00:48:37,376 --> 00:48:39,025
Speaker 0: waste was something nullsoft made.

732
00:48:39,266 --> 00:48:39,930
Speaker 0: we've talked about it.

733
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:48,290
Speaker 1: Anyway, so imagine it for a second like in my house I make a land a bunch of computers wired together and I run a bunch of services.

734
00:48:48,511 --> 00:48:50,719
Speaker 1: Maybe a web server may not game server.

735
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:53,410
Speaker 1: Maybe a file server, right all kinds of stuff, right?

736
00:48:53,911 --> 00:48:55,970
Speaker 1: And then it's not connected to the internet.

737
00:48:56,110 --> 00:49:00,490
Speaker 1: There's no way that anyone can access any of these services unless they come to my house Right.

738
00:49:00,510 --> 00:49:00,591
Speaker 1: Okay.

739
00:49:00,611 --> 00:49:13,810
Speaker 1: So now I Connect it to the internet, but due to fancy networking and several routers and VPNs and all that sort of stuff There's no way for anyone to just connect to it from the internet directly.

740
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:17,490
Speaker 1: They type in the IP address of like, you know, and they're not gonna hit anything.

741
00:49:17,570 --> 00:49:21,310
Speaker 1: It's gonna hit like this outside router and they're not gonna see jack shit.

742
00:49:21,631 --> 00:49:23,718
Speaker 1: none of these services are gonna be accessible to them.

743
00:49:23,738 --> 00:49:30,229
Speaker 0: because basically the way the internet works and we've done old episodes about this is In the end whatever you're trying to get to has an IP address.

744
00:49:30,541 --> 00:49:41,021
Speaker 0: Yeah And there are ranges of IP addresses that are routable meaning if I type in this IP from anything connected to the internet I will be able to get to it from anywhere else on the internet.

745
00:49:41,082 --> 00:49:53,430
Speaker 0: Yep, every router thanks to routing protocols Which we talked about recently because that big cloud flare outage The rise in outages not the cloud flare outage, but like the internet says oh you want to get to that IP?

746
00:49:54,134 --> 00:49:55,362
Speaker 0: I know the next stop.

747
00:49:55,402 --> 00:49:56,469
Speaker 0: go there and ask that guy.

748
00:49:56,635 --> 00:50:04,150
Speaker 0: Yeah Like everything works that way but there are ranges of IPs where every router on the internet will say you can't get there.

749
00:50:04,270 --> 00:50:07,624
Speaker 0: Yep, because they're reserved for things like private networks.

750
00:50:07,664 --> 00:50:11,218
Speaker 0: Like, you know, your house is 192.168 dot something.

751
00:50:11,238 --> 00:50:11,539
Speaker 0: Yep.

752
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:18,776
Speaker 0: That's because everyone's house is 192.168 Unless you're cool, and then it's 10 out something 172.

753
00:50:18,776 --> 00:50:18,877
Speaker 1: Yeah.

754
00:50:18,897 --> 00:50:19,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got the idea.

755
00:50:21,930 --> 00:50:24,617
Speaker 1: The point is if you can set up.

756
00:50:24,798 --> 00:50:49,370
Speaker 1: it's possible and actually quite frequently used things like VPNs Tor onion routing you may have heard of some of this stuff Such that someone who is in the know and has the right software and has the right credentials and has the right Configurations and is in the know could run a bunch of things on their computer and then actually connect to those Services that are otherwise completely inaccessible.

757
00:50:49,831 --> 00:51:06,049
Speaker 1: network wise no amount of searching on the internet or scanning or sending packets will ever find these services because there are layers of encryption and routing and other shenanigans that make them inaccessible except for someone who is in the know and Goes right in there.

758
00:51:06,110 --> 00:51:08,056
Speaker 0: well like waste was an example of that.

759
00:51:08,076 --> 00:51:20,470
Speaker 0: where what it did is if I run this software and Scott runs the software and all the People we personally know and trust run this software We can go to an IP address and send data to each other in a way that no one can trace.

760
00:51:20,490 --> 00:51:21,858
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one else has access to.

761
00:51:21,898 --> 00:51:36,030
Speaker 1: yeah, we can chat we can share files We can do all sorts of stuff and it's a hundred percent encrypted and a hundred percent Deniable and no one will ever know that any of it happened and no one who hasn't been given a key by us Will ever be able to find it or access it even though it's just out on the internet.

762
00:51:36,131 --> 00:51:37,269
Speaker 1: This is even more than that.

763
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,453
Speaker 1: This is like cuz.

764
00:51:38,554 --> 00:51:44,290
Speaker 1: even with a waste someone might be able to scan and say oh, there's a waste there that I can never access.

765
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:46,537
Speaker 1: Yep, this is you'll never find.

766
00:51:46,557 --> 00:51:47,259
Speaker 1: you won't even know.

767
00:51:47,339 --> 00:51:48,884
Speaker 1: this web server is there ever?

768
00:51:48,944 --> 00:51:54,730
Speaker 1: no matter even if you search every IP address On the whole internet and every port you will never see this web server, right?

769
00:51:54,930 --> 00:52:00,929
Speaker 1: You will only maybe see like some sort of VPN gateway that you can't get into and there is completely mysterious shit behind it.

770
00:52:01,190 --> 00:52:20,898
Speaker 0: Yep, like this is the kind of crap where you will like take a range of IP addresses that belong to another company like Microsoft and if you're running the right software and Connected to the right VPN with the right tunnel the right time of day when the moon is full when you type that IP address Instead of going to Microsoft it goes somewhere else.

771
00:52:21,179 --> 00:52:24,528
Speaker 0: Yeah, but when the cops type that IP address it goes to Microsoft.

772
00:52:24,608 --> 00:52:28,377
Speaker 0: Yep, and Shady shit happens in there.

773
00:52:28,417 --> 00:52:37,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is where people are buying and selling bitcoins Using bitcoins to buy and sell drugs and weapons and child porn and all sorts of bad shit.

774
00:52:37,892 --> 00:52:39,664
Speaker 1: Yep, and cuz they like.

775
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:45,228
Speaker 1: let's be honest There is not a lot of reason to go through all this hassle to do legitimate things.

776
00:52:45,288 --> 00:52:49,430
Speaker 0: now I don't think of is activism and oppressive states.

777
00:52:49,530 --> 00:52:50,232
Speaker 1: Yes, that is.

778
00:52:50,272 --> 00:52:55,086
Speaker 1: there are some good reasons to use it and I'm not saying anyone who uses it is bad.

779
00:52:55,186 --> 00:52:56,470
Speaker 1: clearly not right.

780
00:52:56,591 --> 00:52:59,110
Speaker 1: It's like oh, why do you have tinted windows?

781
00:52:59,211 --> 00:53:00,217
Speaker 1: What are you trying to hide?

782
00:53:00,257 --> 00:53:02,430
Speaker 1: if you got nothing to hide you shouldn't be tinting your windows, right?

783
00:53:02,490 --> 00:53:03,749
Speaker 1: We all know that arguments bullshit.

784
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:09,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but the point is just the truth of it is the vast majority of dark web shit is shenanigans.

785
00:53:09,731 --> 00:53:14,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, the smaller dark or people thinking they're cool going to where the bad kids hang out.

786
00:53:14,610 --> 00:53:23,904
Speaker 0: but like for example, a lot of the things that like legitimate uses of dark nets are things like Like we said we're fighting against an oppressive state.

787
00:53:23,985 --> 00:53:26,897
Speaker 0: Yep in those cases You don't really impressive state.

788
00:53:26,917 --> 00:53:30,230
Speaker 1: we just turn the internet off though, then you're not getting to the dark web or the lightweight.

789
00:53:30,391 --> 00:53:33,584
Speaker 0: That's where you need like distributed peer-to-peer nonsense.

790
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's more like waste.

791
00:53:35,210 --> 00:53:38,620
Speaker 0: That's like small scale peer-to-peer friend networks.

792
00:53:38,941 --> 00:53:48,389
Speaker 0: dark web is where you need people you don't know To be able to thanks to knowledge get into the system to interact with you in a way that you can burn that bridge.

793
00:53:48,429 --> 00:53:51,439
Speaker 1: if you Need to write you want to make stuff available on the web.

794
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:54,950
Speaker 1: You don't want just anyone stumbling across it randomly.

795
00:53:55,321 --> 00:54:06,673
Speaker 1: Yeah You want people in the know around the world to be able to get together and share information in a in a place now securely and privately as possible like a like a Speakeasy.

796
00:54:06,693 --> 00:54:10,390
Speaker 1: and but when the cops come they go into the phone booth in the restaurant.

797
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:15,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, they dial the exact right number in a kind of pet shop is open at 3 a.m And it doesn't open.

798
00:54:16,016 --> 00:54:19,410
Speaker 1: but then someone in the know comes and they go right into the speakeasy.

799
00:54:19,651 --> 00:54:24,850
Speaker 0: Yep, so what's funny is we don't need this for software piracy.

800
00:54:25,212 --> 00:54:28,250
Speaker 0: Software piracy just happens without the dark web, right?

801
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:31,441
Speaker 1: You only need the dark web for much more heinous and much more.

802
00:54:31,481 --> 00:54:33,649
Speaker 1: do you need the dark web to get like?

803
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:42,612
Speaker 0: The bot the key to the botnet you paid for with bitcoins that you got that you're trying to use to launder the cocaine money Like.

804
00:54:42,652 --> 00:54:44,860
Speaker 0: that is what you use the dark net for the dark.

805
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:52,168
Speaker 1: or you use the dark web to feel cool because you're hanging out With people who you believe these fantastical tales of bitcoins and drugs about.

806
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:54,188
Speaker 1: yeah You hear those kinds of stories.

807
00:54:54,208 --> 00:54:55,495
Speaker 1: you go Oh, I want to get in on that.

808
00:54:55,556 --> 00:54:57,686
Speaker 1: and then you go do some dark web and it's kind of boring.

809
00:54:58,087 --> 00:55:00,217
Speaker 1: and it's just some Websites, they're just websites.

810
00:55:00,237 --> 00:55:04,876
Speaker 1: You couldn't see unless you did a bunch of shenanigans with Tor and onion routing Yep, and now there's websites there.

811
00:55:04,897 --> 00:55:07,808
Speaker 1: So based on really cool cuz you're seeing websites other people can't see.

812
00:55:07,828 --> 00:55:07,888
Speaker 1: Yep.

813
00:55:08,671 --> 00:55:12,047
Speaker 0: So based on Wikipedia cuz I'm poking around on some stats that are posted here.

814
00:55:12,067 --> 00:55:14,397
Speaker 0: Yep Onion services like.

815
00:55:14,457 --> 00:55:16,509
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into all the different ways this works.

816
00:55:17,215 --> 00:55:32,270
Speaker 0: What I will say is if you're young and you're going into college Study the technology of how dark networks and overlay networks Technology at least some of it especially the routing technology is useful for network engineering and legitimate purposes.

817
00:55:32,291 --> 00:55:38,630
Speaker 0: Yeah Like if you think about it that I have not studied closely because it was not much of a thing when I was in college.

818
00:55:38,951 --> 00:55:44,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you think about like a lot of corporate internets and kind of stuff is not too far away from dark web.

819
00:55:44,592 --> 00:55:45,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want it.

820
00:55:45,539 --> 00:55:49,760
Speaker 0: you want to do like fancy Balancing is dark web adjacent tech.

821
00:55:49,961 --> 00:55:56,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, so based on Wikipedia It seems like the dark web is used almost entirely to buy and sell drugs.

822
00:55:56,789 --> 00:55:58,339
Speaker 1: Yes That is the number one use.

823
00:55:58,379 --> 00:55:58,661
Speaker 0: for sure.

824
00:55:58,681 --> 00:56:04,606
Speaker 0: that seems number two Let's see is selling other things like it other illegal goods that are not drugs.

825
00:56:04,706 --> 00:56:10,630
Speaker 1: Yep and fraud I think it's drugs are the most I think because they are ones that you can't sell.

826
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:13,230
Speaker 1: It's something you can't sell easily on the open web.

827
00:56:13,230 --> 00:56:17,210
Speaker 0: I mean if the geek nice website just started selling cocaine can't sell crack on Amazon.

828
00:56:17,370 --> 00:56:19,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it the end.

829
00:56:19,275 --> 00:56:20,117
Speaker 1: but you can.

830
00:56:20,639 --> 00:56:21,421
Speaker 1: usually you can.

831
00:56:21,521 --> 00:56:25,210
Speaker 1: it's actually pretty easy to ship cocaine like just by UPS or whatever.

832
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:27,710
Speaker 1: It actually gets through a surprising amount of time.

833
00:56:28,011 --> 00:56:30,544
Speaker 0: I did because you keep saying it's actually really easy to be clear.

834
00:56:30,585 --> 00:56:31,630
Speaker 0: We do not ship cocaine.

835
00:56:31,770 --> 00:56:34,158
Speaker 1: I never I'm the person doesn't drink alcohol.

836
00:56:34,178 --> 00:56:37,629
Speaker 1: You think I've ever bought or sold or you touched any cocaine ever, right?

837
00:56:37,930 --> 00:56:39,174
Speaker 0: It's like no, but for whatever.

838
00:56:39,214 --> 00:56:43,650
Speaker 0: like a lot like actually like people ship illegal things all the time.

839
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:45,218
Speaker 0: It's just like postal service, but it's a

840
00:56:45,258 --> 00:56:47,148
Speaker 1: lot harder to ship say a gun

841
00:56:47,891 --> 00:56:48,533
Speaker 0: Yeah, right

842
00:56:48,734 --> 00:56:58,870
Speaker 1: in an illegal manner because it's like that's a big metal thing that would be detected Whereas some white powder in a tiny bag usually ends up in an envelope and someone's mailbox and then they call the police

843
00:56:59,151 --> 00:57:01,479
Speaker 0: Yep, it's not like it got there right now.

844
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:04,510
Speaker 0: Where do you put your storefront that says I'm selling cocaine?

845
00:57:04,792 --> 00:57:05,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't.

846
00:57:05,296 --> 00:57:07,149
Speaker 1: you got to put it somewhere where cops can't see it.

847
00:57:07,290 --> 00:57:15,050
Speaker 0: You put it on the dark web with an address for like bitcoins Yep, and if someone deposits bitcoins, then you just mail a package.

848
00:57:15,913 --> 00:57:22,560
Speaker 1: I'm sure the dark web is also full of tricks to catch naive people who have Googled on how to get to the dark web.

849
00:57:22,801 --> 00:57:33,030
Speaker 1: guys at the dark web look for the drugstore Yeah, and then got fooled and then got all their bitcoins robbed Which is funny because before the dark way don't hang out in the shady part of town kids.

850
00:57:33,454 --> 00:57:34,750
Speaker 0: Actually, there is one dark web.

851
00:57:35,051 --> 00:57:36,619
Speaker 0: You know what?

852
00:57:36,699 --> 00:57:39,030
Speaker 0: one of the big one of the dark webs that we actually used a lot.

853
00:57:39,171 --> 00:57:55,090
Speaker 0: That isn't really a thing anymore Internet - was kind of a dark web sort of in the sense that the RIAA An entire separate network the RIAA and the MPAA and the cops Couldn't really get access to internet - well, I don't know who's doing these.

854
00:57:55,110 --> 00:57:56,723
Speaker 0: It's not a thing anymore at all.

855
00:57:56,904 --> 00:58:01,663
Speaker 0: Not really now Okay But basically because we were at a university that had access to this.

856
00:58:02,044 --> 00:58:03,710
Speaker 0: we had access to a separate network.

857
00:58:04,072 --> 00:58:09,242
Speaker 0: So like between you of our and our IT there was this direct connect server that we all had access to.

858
00:58:09,282 --> 00:58:13,582
Speaker 0: that no one else had access to so No one could see what we were pirating.

859
00:58:14,326 --> 00:58:15,070
Speaker 0: That was just the thing.

860
00:58:15,532 --> 00:58:18,283
Speaker 0: We had this private piracy network that no one else could access.

861
00:58:19,046 --> 00:58:25,365
Speaker 0: so it's kind of like that Internet - seems to still exist but it's not the kind of thing it was when we were.

862
00:58:25,486 --> 00:58:26,590
Speaker 0: it's not the same thing anymore.

863
00:58:26,912 --> 00:58:28,380
Speaker 1: It still seems to be the same as it was.

864
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:30,150
Speaker 1: I don't think it's advanced very much.

865
00:58:30,351 --> 00:58:32,369
Speaker 0: There are like that direct connect is gone.

866
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:36,378
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, yeah, sure But I'm saying the net internet to itself is.

867
00:58:36,478 --> 00:58:39,570
Speaker 0: it does not have the advantages that it had back in the day.

868
00:58:39,670 --> 00:58:43,487
Speaker 1: It is 500 members including 251 institutions of higher education.

869
00:58:43,507 --> 00:59:01,944
Speaker 1: Yep so if you're at one of those 500 places you can you're on internet - basically internet - if you don't know is 500 places on earth that have their own separate internet connections like physically and They can all share data with each other much much faster than people are internet normal.

870
00:59:02,205 --> 00:59:03,589
Speaker 0: Yep, but it's like it's.

871
00:59:03,830 --> 00:59:03,950
Speaker 0: it's.

872
00:59:04,931 --> 00:59:10,030
Speaker 0: All I'll say is that it is policed in a way that it was not capable of being policed when we were in college.

873
00:59:10,617 --> 00:59:11,468
Speaker 0: I was leaving at that.

874
00:59:12,956 --> 00:59:15,375
Speaker 0: so What do we do with dark like?

875
00:59:16,078 --> 00:59:17,744
Speaker 0: what would we do about dark nets?

876
00:59:17,864 --> 00:59:19,270
Speaker 0: There's no way to make them go away.

877
00:59:19,843 --> 00:59:28,270
Speaker 1: I mean It's the fundamental structure of the internet and the networking technologies that have been developed Will always mean that yeah, it's possible to do things like this.

878
00:59:28,370 --> 00:59:33,190
Speaker 0: There's always holes and cracks in systems like say these darkness all get taken down.

879
00:59:33,551 --> 00:59:35,338
Speaker 0: people would know that if you're

880
00:59:35,499 --> 00:59:35,739
Speaker 1: on the

881
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:53,150
Speaker 0: World of Warcraft server at a particular time of day at a particular time of place when the moon is full you go talk to the weird-looking elf and He will give you a word and you give it to someone else and then you have a private chat with someone and then You follow the trail of breadcrumbs and eventually you buy your internet cocaine with a Bitcoin.

882
00:59:55,532 --> 00:59:55,774
Speaker 1: Right.

883
00:59:55,794 --> 01:00:03,548
Speaker 1: It's just mathematically impossible to You know not have this technology unless you make an internet that works differently and I think it's too late for that.

884
01:00:03,809 --> 01:00:06,759
Speaker 1: Yep So, I mean they're just there are what they are.

885
01:00:06,779 --> 01:00:08,165
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's out there.

886
01:00:08,346 --> 01:00:08,968
Speaker 0: They're the modern.

887
01:00:09,631 --> 01:00:10,454
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

888
01:00:10,514 --> 01:00:12,843
Speaker 1: Don't go trying to do stupid shit and losing all your money.

889
01:00:12,883 --> 01:00:14,690
Speaker 1: Don't fuck around with evil bitcoins and stuff.

890
01:00:15,031 --> 01:00:20,415
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe use this stuff, you know, if you have a legitimate reason or you just want to you know Learn about networking.

891
01:00:20,716 --> 01:00:29,386
Speaker 0: so what I was getting on to about with before I got sidetracked on internet, too Is that in those early 2000s era because in the 90s like pirated software was just always great.

892
01:00:29,947 --> 01:00:39,330
Speaker 0: but in the 2000s If you went to the wrong place to get wares You would get your pirated software and it was full of malware.

893
01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:47,380
Speaker 0: Yep, but if you knew the right people you'd go to very similar looking sites that had the legit stuff You just had to know.

894
01:00:47,400 --> 01:00:50,419
Speaker 0: Yep, and The dark web is the same way.

895
01:00:50,439 --> 01:00:51,646
Speaker 0: I guess you just have to know right.

896
01:00:51,666 --> 01:00:56,864
Speaker 1: for example today I was reading a story about how people pirate video from like Netflix and stuff.

897
01:00:57,004 --> 01:00:58,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, and apparently they go to Netflix.

898
01:00:58,850 --> 01:01:00,135
Speaker 1: They watch a video right.

899
01:01:00,336 --> 01:01:04,310
Speaker 1: it takes about like eight minutes or whatever because how long is the Netflix video take to download, right?

900
01:01:04,710 --> 01:01:08,328
Speaker 1: They capture all the the chunks of video, but it's all encrypted.

901
01:01:08,348 --> 01:01:10,910
Speaker 1: in the end If you try to watch it in VLC, those be black screen.

902
01:01:11,271 --> 01:01:17,548
Speaker 1: But they capture all the packets right and then they there's tools to decrypt those things and make actual watchable mp4s.

903
01:01:18,491 --> 01:01:22,103
Speaker 1: Those tools are very highly guarded by the people that made them.

904
01:01:22,163 --> 01:01:33,414
Speaker 1: if you try to go on the dark web and search for them You'll find like old fake ones or you're like you'll find someone selling the software for like a Bitcoin or two and actually hahaha They give you software that doesn't work.

905
01:01:33,655 --> 01:01:35,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but they do.

906
01:01:36,161 --> 01:01:39,410
Speaker 0: they give you software that seals the rest of your Bitcoin, right?

907
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:46,000
Speaker 1: There's a small number of people that have developed and share and use this software that it can actually you know Has the decryption.

908
01:01:46,061 --> 01:01:46,769
Speaker 1: probably people who?

909
01:01:47,733 --> 01:01:53,330
Speaker 1: You know anonymous people who probably work to make the encryption in Netflix are probably also getting the decryption out there.

910
01:01:53,471 --> 01:01:58,950
Speaker 1: It's probably I imagine it's an inside job And you know, it's highly guarded.

911
01:01:59,151 --> 01:02:00,718
Speaker 1: So it's not something you can google for.

912
01:02:00,758 --> 01:02:03,329
Speaker 1: you have to know the right dark web place to go get it.

913
01:02:03,771 --> 01:02:08,683
Speaker 0: Dark webs are basically now they're kind of like those shady bazaars in cyberpunk fantasy.

914
01:02:08,904 --> 01:02:10,488
Speaker 0: Yep, like kind of legit.

915
01:02:10,508 --> 01:02:20,674
Speaker 1: That's what they are Yep, and like I said like you go in planescape and you go to the back of the bar Yeah, and you go through the portal in the door You're gone.

916
01:02:20,694 --> 01:02:25,070
Speaker 1: You're in some other place and when the cops come in they look in the back room and it's a back room.

917
01:02:25,331 --> 01:02:45,590
Speaker 0: so my advice to you the listener is that one if you are not super confident in your personal ability to know how to deal with bad people and You do not have like deep confidence in your own like OPSEC do not interact with the dark web.

918
01:02:45,811 --> 01:02:47,477
Speaker 0: Yep, you are going to get effed.

919
01:02:47,818 --> 01:02:50,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that is not something you should be messing around with.

920
01:02:51,039 --> 01:02:51,167
Speaker 1: Nope.

921
01:02:51,651 --> 01:03:05,876
Speaker 0: Number two if you are going to school or want to learn about networking if you learn how dark nets and overlay networks and onion networks and all this stuff work you will be highly sought after because this stuff is Very complicated and very teat.

922
01:03:05,896 --> 01:03:20,350
Speaker 0: like it is difficult to understand the nuances of how these things are actually set up Mmm, and if you learn how to make that like how this stuff works You can get a job in corporate IT or you can get a job working for those same shady people.

923
01:03:20,532 --> 01:03:30,926
Speaker 1: If you are very confident in your abilities Yeah You also can you know learn enough that you could say go and browse the dark web and just not engage in any shady Activities as long as you don't do any bitcoins or drugs or guns.

924
01:03:30,987 --> 01:03:36,169
Speaker 1: if you just you know around and see what You'll see some interesting stuff and have some fun.

925
01:03:36,491 --> 01:03:40,110
Speaker 0: You'll probably see a lot of child porn though - don't look at that either.

926
01:03:40,371 --> 01:03:43,325
Speaker 0: But that seems to be a big part of what is on the dark way.

927
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,921
Speaker 1: I imagine it is Don't do don't look at that.

928
01:03:46,485 --> 01:03:47,050
Speaker 1: just go to you.

929
01:03:47,130 --> 01:03:52,978
Speaker 1: But you could you know do some onion routing and have you know fun Just doing the technology part of it itself.

930
01:03:53,058 --> 01:03:56,976
Speaker 1: the same way you would have fun setting up like a raid in your house And then not using it.

931
01:03:56,996 --> 01:03:57,057
Speaker 1: Yep.

932
01:03:57,137 --> 01:03:58,910
Speaker 1: All right, but I cannot much data.

933
01:03:58,990 --> 01:04:08,692
Speaker 0: I cannot stress enough and I say this as someone who is very Interested in hacking and cracking and freaking back when that was still a thing Don't like.

934
01:04:08,833 --> 01:04:13,630
Speaker 0: this is actually kind of dangerous to fuck around with if you are not careful.

935
01:04:13,962 --> 01:04:18,786
Speaker 1: Yeah Cuz like you go to a drug selling website and then oh it's one the FBI set up on the.

936
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:22,435
Speaker 1: if you can figure out How to get on the darkwebs right the one that you can.

937
01:04:22,516 --> 01:04:29,326
Speaker 1: even more importantly your place that you can find is the place the FBI can find also and They set up a fake drugstore and you buy a drug from it or

938
01:04:29,386 --> 01:04:34,784
Speaker 0: more importantly you you fuck with the wrong person and buy something from them and then they blackmail you right

939
01:04:34,844 --> 01:04:35,085
Speaker 1: because

940
01:04:35,125 --> 01:04:36,268
Speaker 0: they are not great people.

941
01:04:36,288 --> 01:04:43,343
Speaker 0: and this is Do not let people in places like that figure out who you are.

942
01:04:43,363 --> 01:04:48,263
Speaker 1: It's like oh, yeah Bitcoin is anonymous and then Oh, it's not and then you don't do it right.

943
01:04:48,343 --> 01:04:49,609
Speaker 1: and now you know who you are.

944
01:04:50,412 --> 01:04:55,429
Speaker 0: If you have all say this if you think Bitcoin is anonymous never ever use the dark web.

945
01:04:56,212 --> 01:05:07,265
Speaker 0: Bitcoin is so the opposite of anonymous that half of what happens on the dark web is you need to pay people in Bitcoin to anonymize the other bitcoins you use to buy your cocaine or to sell your cocaine and

946
01:05:07,305 --> 01:05:08,007
Speaker 1: not steal them

947
01:05:08,429 --> 01:05:14,410
Speaker 0: and then The only way to get that money out of the system is to launder it literally money laundering.

948
01:05:14,932 --> 01:05:18,830
Speaker 0: You have to commit federal crimes to get money back out of the dark web.

949
01:05:19,071 --> 01:05:22,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if you didn't do anything illegal in the dark web.

950
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:26,770
Speaker 1: Yep So, uh, yeah, don't do anything involving coins and you'll be more okay.

951
01:05:26,770 --> 01:05:28,175
Speaker 0: Don't do anything involving coins.

952
01:05:28,536 --> 01:05:30,523
Speaker 0: Don't buy anything on the top.

953
01:05:30,543 --> 01:05:41,176
Speaker 1: type your personal information into anything ever Yep If you are not confident that you are not as the dark web using a computer that is not have access to your other computers Or the personal information on them.

954
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,621
Speaker 0: Yep.

955
01:05:42,922 --> 01:05:44,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe use like a virtual machine or some shit.

956
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:49,106
Speaker 0: Yep, don't necessarily trust that VPN you're paying for to protect you.

957
01:05:49,427 --> 01:05:50,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, no, no, no.

958
01:05:50,850 --> 01:05:57,196
Speaker 0: Basically stay away from this stuff unless you are one of the few edge cases we talked about but you know if you're.

959
01:05:57,256 --> 01:06:02,133
Speaker 1: I think the best way to fool around with it would be actually because I just mentioned a Virtual machine.

960
01:06:02,153 --> 01:06:07,890
Speaker 1: Yep, make a little dark web in your house with a bunch of virtual machines or a better.

961
01:06:08,291 --> 01:06:14,490
Speaker 1: Oh make your own little dark web with like a bunch of like, you know cloud service like machines like on Oz or line.

962
01:06:14,531 --> 01:06:16,415
Speaker 0: Oh, there's no more Pro move.

963
01:06:16,817 --> 01:06:19,330
Speaker 0: Nah, this is if I were younger and still in college.

964
01:06:19,511 --> 01:06:23,250
Speaker 1: This is the kind of thing I would and then get all your friends and teach them how to access your own dark web.

965
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:25,130
Speaker 1: That doesn't have drugs or child porn or bitcoins.

966
01:06:25,331 --> 01:06:32,282
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I would do this if I was younger or if things were more dire, but make a dark net Yep for you and your friends to have fun.

967
01:06:32,623 --> 01:06:34,190
Speaker 0: Yep, that would be cool.

968
01:06:34,573 --> 01:06:43,984
Speaker 0: And if you do this and you do it Right, then if an oppressive state appears in a place you live where it wasn't previously You still have any kind of internet connection.

969
01:06:44,004 --> 01:06:44,648
Speaker 1: You'll be alright.

970
01:06:44,929 --> 01:06:53,730
Speaker 0: Yep This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
