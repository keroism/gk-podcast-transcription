1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,617
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Monday October 18th.

2
00:00:10,878 --> 00:00:11,420
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:14,830
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight because it's been at least a year.

4
00:00:14,971 --> 00:00:16,950
Speaker 0: It's a tech news roundup.

5
00:00:22,851 --> 00:00:23,864
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:26,052 --> 00:00:33,679
Speaker 0: So as you all know I went about a hundred and sixty eight hundred and seventy hours without caffeine last week My epic anti caffeine odyssey,

7
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,508
Speaker 1: so I guess you drink caffeine today of

8
00:00:35,588 --> 00:00:48,590
Speaker 0: course But my plan was to reduce my dependence and get out of the physical addiction stage and then Experience something I haven't experienced in many years what a caffeine rush feels like when you haven't become completely a hundred percent tolerant to it.

9
00:00:49,446 --> 00:00:52,878
Speaker 0: so Observations because a lot of people were really interested in this.

10
00:00:53,199 --> 00:01:03,750
Speaker 0: the withdrawal symptoms are real and they occur like clockwork 48 hours after your last coffee splitting headache and then for like the next few days aches and all your joints mm-hmm.

11
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:06,401
Speaker 0: And then you'll feel completely normal.

12
00:01:06,562 --> 00:01:14,190
Speaker 0: I don't feel different though I expected that maybe caffeine was doing something to me that maybe I would feel like more awake or different in my life.

13
00:01:14,312 --> 00:01:15,169
Speaker 1: Just can't tell.

14
00:01:16,671 --> 00:01:18,609
Speaker 0: Maybe I mean it might be a Jekyll and Hyde syndrome.

15
00:01:19,592 --> 00:01:22,405
Speaker 0: But the one thing I can say is I don't feel different.

16
00:01:22,566 --> 00:01:23,310
Speaker 0: I feel normal.

17
00:01:23,711 --> 00:01:28,589
Speaker 0: I feel the way that I felt when I had caffeine in my system when I was addicted mm-hmm.

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:35,770
Speaker 0: But when I consumed caffeine over lunch today after having gone a complete week without any it was a fucking rush.

19
00:01:36,052 --> 00:01:36,757
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

20
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:38,450
Speaker 0: It was really awesome.

21
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:41,190
Speaker 0: So now I did a bunch of research.

22
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:59,069
Speaker 0: I feel like if I have no more than 100 milligrams of caffeine Per two days I can maintain at most a low level tolerance yet at the same time not achieve total tolerance and enjoy all the benefits of caffeine without all the Pain in the ass of having to constantly take caffeine just to stay awake.

23
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:02,674
Speaker 1: Yeah Let's see.

24
00:02:02,714 --> 00:02:09,949
Speaker 1: so today right I went to work Yeah, and then I realized since I'd worked from home on Friday my work computer was home.

25
00:02:10,971 --> 00:02:13,361
Speaker 1: So I got to work and there was no computer.

26
00:02:13,381 --> 00:02:15,630
Speaker 0: so I daddy to work computers.

27
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:16,316
Speaker 1: So I went.

28
00:02:16,397 --> 00:02:17,286
Speaker 1: I went all the way home.

29
00:02:17,306 --> 00:02:17,366
Speaker 1: now

30
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:19,459
Speaker 0: I got a work laptop that I leave at home

31
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:22,495
Speaker 1: when all I went all the way home and then all the way back Again

32
00:02:23,058 --> 00:02:30,314
Speaker 0: see if you had dynamic DNS setup And you left the laptop on you could have remote desktop into it from work And then worked

33
00:02:30,595 --> 00:02:31,639
Speaker 1: from what computer at work.

34
00:02:31,659 --> 00:02:33,064
Speaker 0: You don't have any computer at work.

35
00:02:33,104 --> 00:02:33,766
Speaker 0: Just the laptop.

36
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:34,208
Speaker 1: That's it.

37
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:36,590
Speaker 0: Oh Wow actually at work.

38
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:44,430
Speaker 0: I got this huge like quad-core Ubuntu development box And then I got my normal like quad-core Windows PC, and then I got my work laptop.

39
00:02:44,972 --> 00:02:48,423
Speaker 1: Yeah, just have it the one computer the stupid Mac which I have.

40
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:50,390
Speaker 0: I also actually have a terminal server.

41
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:53,219
Speaker 0: So if all those computers die I can are.

42
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,159
Speaker 0: I can remote desktop into a terminal server that has all the stuff I need on it.

43
00:02:58,858 --> 00:03:01,576
Speaker 1: Also Over the weekend.

44
00:03:01,596 --> 00:03:03,869
Speaker 1: I actually tried to make donuts for reals that you did.

45
00:03:04,351 --> 00:03:07,261
Speaker 0: I I would have come to your donut thing, but I had other plans.

46
00:03:07,763 --> 00:03:09,047
Speaker 1: that the it's alright.

47
00:03:09,087 --> 00:03:12,219
Speaker 1: because the donuts You know I don't they were not that it was weird.

48
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:12,901
Speaker 1: They were not.

49
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:15,270
Speaker 0: that magnificent should have used more trans fat.

50
00:03:15,411 --> 00:03:19,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know, but I learned a lot about donutting and I'm sure my it will improve greatly.

51
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:26,087
Speaker 1: But the thing was is when I went back home to get that computer that I left there I grabbed one of the donuts that I put in a ziploc bag.

52
00:03:26,127 --> 00:03:26,550
Speaker 0: was it good?

53
00:03:27,153 --> 00:03:38,430
Speaker 1: It was much better actually better than it was when it was fresh out of the oil Which is the opposite of what I was going for because the place in Seattle fresh out of the oil They're like oh, you're gonna die you're gonna wait in line and fork over your whole wallet.

54
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:42,350
Speaker 0: I waited in line for 40 minutes to get those donuts again on Sunday.

55
00:03:42,631 --> 00:03:45,807
Speaker 1: But if you but if you get them after they've been sitting there a while.

56
00:03:45,847 --> 00:03:46,350
Speaker 1: They're no good.

57
00:03:46,752 --> 00:03:58,310
Speaker 1: You know I ended up making the opposite like when I ate the donut that was like You know like sat in the plastic bag overnight And it was much superior to the donut that I you know when it was fresh the day before.

58
00:03:58,611 --> 00:03:59,976
Speaker 0: Huh, maybe the oil congealed.

59
00:03:59,996 --> 00:04:01,381
Speaker 0: well what it was is hot.

60
00:04:01,442 --> 00:04:12,721
Speaker 1: the edges of the donut the crust part You know the surface was still slightly burninated because of you know factors like using butter inside the donut Which I shouldn't have done and inconsistent oil temperature.

61
00:04:12,742 --> 00:04:14,690
Speaker 0: We definitely have a pro butter bias.

62
00:04:15,072 --> 00:04:18,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, sometimes butter is not the answer, but I always feel like I can make like the answer.

63
00:04:18,769 --> 00:04:21,141
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I'm gonna do is well cuz why I like butter?

64
00:04:21,281 --> 00:04:22,648
Speaker 1: because doesn't have trans fat right.

65
00:04:22,728 --> 00:04:23,634
Speaker 0: well remember we can't.

66
00:04:23,674 --> 00:04:27,153
Speaker 0: you can't use if you want to do the Project DT.

67
00:04:27,173 --> 00:04:30,504
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't actually DT works for that.

68
00:04:30,946 --> 00:04:34,830
Speaker 1: You can't use the trans fats And I gotta figure out what's going on with that.

69
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:38,602
Speaker 1: But anyway if I I'm gonna try to use peanut oils right.

70
00:04:38,682 --> 00:04:48,639
Speaker 1: if I use peanut oil for the frying I can Filter it and reuse it over and over again because I had to use a whole tub of Crisco to fry this Donuts and it still wasn't enough.

71
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:51,469
Speaker 0: I would add to bite you fried them in Crisco straight up.

72
00:04:51,831 --> 00:04:53,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, whoa that's what you're supposed to do.

73
00:04:53,598 --> 00:04:54,221
Speaker 0: when I was a kid.

74
00:04:54,261 --> 00:05:00,422
Speaker 1: We always used like safflower oil Supposedly supposed to use safflower oil for stir-frying, but not for deep frying.

75
00:05:00,783 --> 00:05:01,646
Speaker 1: Oh, that's what they.

76
00:05:01,827 --> 00:05:02,529
Speaker 1: that's what people say.

77
00:05:02,549 --> 00:05:04,279
Speaker 0: yeah You know I've read the same forum thread.

78
00:05:04,822 --> 00:05:06,090
Speaker 1: no, but I'll sir on the Internet.

79
00:05:06,596 --> 00:05:07,510
Speaker 1: I didn't read it in the forum.

80
00:05:07,591 --> 00:05:12,384
Speaker 1: but I'm gonna get peanut oil and I'm gonna use the peanut oil can reuse cuz I mean that's how.

81
00:05:12,404 --> 00:05:15,928
Speaker 1: but Crisco was six bucks and I would have needed actually two of them to make it deep enough.

82
00:05:15,948 --> 00:05:21,590
Speaker 1: and Reusing Crisco is not great because you want to let it cool before you rebottle it or whatever.

83
00:05:22,193 --> 00:05:25,130
Speaker 1: But if you let Crisco cool it turns into white goop, and you have to scrape.

84
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:27,962
Speaker 1: It's no good, but the peanut oil will stay liquid right.

85
00:05:28,042 --> 00:05:29,790
Speaker 1: so I get the peanut oil.

86
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:40,270
Speaker 1: I'll fry the donuts in peanut oil, but I'll use Crisco in the donuts themselves Such that they'll be full of trans fat and therefore delicious they will not.

87
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,767
Speaker 1: You know well it is zero trans fat per serving in the Crisco way.

88
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,310
Speaker 0: Yeah See I'm dubious of that.

89
00:05:47,410 --> 00:05:55,043
Speaker 0: I mean if the ingredients say zero trans fat for this tiny serving and they also say Constituted almost entirely of partially hydrogenated oils.

90
00:05:55,063 --> 00:06:06,907
Speaker 1: Yeah There's no trans fat in there at all is there, but anyway the you know I'll put that in the donut itself because it's actually a relatively small portion of the of the whole right.

91
00:06:06,927 --> 00:06:13,849
Speaker 1: I mean this recipe that I used had like three and a half cups of flour and all this other stuff and like half a stick of butter.

92
00:06:13,889 --> 00:06:18,410
Speaker 1: wait I got an idea, so it's not a lot of Crisco that goes into the actual dough.

93
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:24,356
Speaker 0: I got a really good idea because we you know we didn't go apple picking last weekend and this coming weekend is the last Goddamn weekend.

94
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:26,410
Speaker 0: you can go apple picking and have it be even worth going.

95
00:06:26,672 --> 00:06:29,817
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm if we go apple picking They'll be cider donuts.

96
00:06:29,837 --> 00:06:30,882
Speaker 1: you want to ask them what there is.

97
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:34,599
Speaker 0: you should just be friendly and be like hey What's the recipe for these cider donuts?

98
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:36,470
Speaker 0: and watch them and like see how they're making them?

99
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:37,675
Speaker 1: They just you know what they're gonna have.

100
00:06:37,695 --> 00:06:41,110
Speaker 1: they're gonna have a machine and they're gonna have a bag full of powder.

101
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:46,046
Speaker 1: They're gonna add water to it And they're gonna dump it in the top of the machine and then out come the side and just be seriously.

102
00:06:46,086 --> 00:06:48,050
Speaker 0: just ask him like alright Where'd you get that white powder?

103
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:52,502
Speaker 0: They buy it from a food distribute and find out who that food distributor is.

104
00:06:52,562 --> 00:06:57,440
Speaker 1: and I mean if you get it from any food Distributor yeah, it's just donut mix.

105
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,729
Speaker 0: so why not use the stuff that tastes the best?

106
00:07:00,472 --> 00:07:02,320
Speaker 1: Cuz that stuff isn't necessarily the best.

107
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:02,621
Speaker 1: I got it.

108
00:07:02,661 --> 00:07:03,584
Speaker 1: I want to make it special.

109
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:04,388
Speaker 1: right you got to go.

110
00:07:04,428 --> 00:07:08,122
Speaker 0: project Cup noodle on this like you look at Chipotle.

111
00:07:08,162 --> 00:07:09,710
Speaker 1: right Chipotle doesn't just order.

112
00:07:10,112 --> 00:07:16,170
Speaker 1: You know that meat from you know I mean they do order it But it's like they prepare it and it's so they got a recipe that they prepare at the Chipotle.

113
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:16,816
Speaker 1: That's like.

114
00:07:17,058 --> 00:07:18,490
Speaker 1: that's what sets them apart Scott.

115
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:19,333
Speaker 0: It's like the cup noodle.

116
00:07:19,373 --> 00:07:22,948
Speaker 0: when they found the the ultra fancy particular one shrimp that stayed pink.

117
00:07:23,128 --> 00:07:24,517
Speaker 1: exactly That's what I got to do.

118
00:07:24,618 --> 00:07:26,027
Speaker 1: I got to do project X donut.

119
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:31,691
Speaker 0: You know I can't just be but I think the way to go about this would be to first go around and sample everyone else's Cider.

120
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:33,082
Speaker 1: I've already done that in my whole life.

121
00:07:33,102 --> 00:07:33,686
Speaker 1: I have 28 years.

122
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,896
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and you know what my experience has been.

123
00:07:36,278 --> 00:07:37,944
Speaker 0: all cider donuts are fucking awesome.

124
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:38,666
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

125
00:07:38,807 --> 00:07:39,650
Speaker 1: That's why I'm trying to make.

126
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:46,769
Speaker 1: I'm also gonna experiment with glaze because you can't be a donut king if you don't know about glaze.

127
00:07:47,071 --> 00:07:49,504
Speaker 0: But you know you know why is glaze cider donut?

128
00:07:49,524 --> 00:07:50,067
Speaker 0: fuck that.

129
00:07:50,087 --> 00:07:50,670
Speaker 0: what do you mean?

130
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,095
Speaker 1: You make like a cider glaze.

131
00:07:52,236 --> 00:07:55,508
Speaker 0: no no if you're gonna make a glaze donut like that the key is maple.

132
00:07:55,648 --> 00:07:56,793
Speaker 0: maple glaze Maple glaze.

133
00:07:56,813 --> 00:07:57,215
Speaker 1: very good.

134
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:58,039
Speaker 0: That's the way to go.

135
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:00,130
Speaker 1: I think is that so I got experiment with glazes.

136
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:01,656
Speaker 1: I got to know all about glaze.

137
00:08:01,837 --> 00:08:03,865
Speaker 1: I gotta be and I'm gonna glaze all kinds of shit.

138
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:05,130
Speaker 1: glaze pretzels.

139
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:07,847
Speaker 0: Glaze fruit glaze pretzel does not sound so good.

140
00:08:07,927 --> 00:08:10,279
Speaker 1: Oh come on Do you get like a you know a chocolate-covered pretzel?

141
00:08:10,339 --> 00:08:12,388
Speaker 1: now just imagine glaze strawberry glaze pretzel.

142
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:13,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, it would be like.

143
00:08:14,017 --> 00:08:16,530
Speaker 1: it would be like fucking Pocky with Saul's.

144
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,519
Speaker 0: So it sounds like double Pocky with.

145
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:24,505
Speaker 0: sounds like project DT is the backup plan of project st And project continue to work at a job.

146
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:25,109
Speaker 0: both fail.

147
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:29,390
Speaker 1: I think they're all project fail.

148
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:39,826
Speaker 1: But you know the thing is if there's anything that I've learned over the past many years It's that the things that are awesome are not the things that you try to do the accidents right.

149
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:41,169
Speaker 1: Twitter was an accident.

150
00:08:41,852 --> 00:08:44,020
Speaker 1: Almost everything was an accident and not intentional.

151
00:08:44,081 --> 00:08:45,065
Speaker 0: so how come with geek knives?

152
00:08:45,105 --> 00:08:49,706
Speaker 0: we never made anything To accomplish something that itself was useful independently.

153
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,196
Speaker 1: I made a Podcasting website.

154
00:08:52,256 --> 00:08:54,770
Speaker 0: yeah, if only podcasting mattered.

155
00:08:55,292 --> 00:09:03,269
Speaker 1: I think our problem is that we use money a lot of times instead of making something right like if we would have made a Mixer that was like the ultimate podcasting mixer instead of buying one.

156
00:09:03,793 --> 00:09:13,779
Speaker 0: Then we would have like a product that we could sell except There's a million podcasting mixers that are way cheap made with Chinese parts, and I couldn't do better than that on my own No But I mean just in terms of the feature set.

157
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:19,830
Speaker 1: right because we would design one that have like more inputs And a USB and you know all these things that no one is gonna make.

158
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:21,253
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

159
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:29,889
Speaker 0: when I was doing all my research because you know we're the problem really is that we do our own research And my research showed that oh all that exists, and it's actually really cheap

160
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:30,873
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

161
00:09:31,154 --> 00:09:31,857
Speaker 0: so I just bought it,

162
00:09:32,521 --> 00:09:37,150
Speaker 1: but I mean there's always something that I'm like oh They should do this like that doesn't exist there's no market for it.

163
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:39,162
Speaker 1: It's like the in-between product you know.

164
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:42,718
Speaker 0: yeah except the problem There is a lot of times there really isn't a market for.

165
00:09:42,758 --> 00:09:43,742
Speaker 0: I mean look at podcasting.

166
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,050
Speaker 0: podcasting is basically dead.

167
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:59,614
Speaker 0: Like it is such a niche that most podcasts that are popular are professional or semi-professional like us anyway And the other half it's just Skype and like that Logitech stick microphone Actually nowadays.

168
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:02,565
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people use like Xbox style headset, whatever.

169
00:10:02,585 --> 00:10:03,870
Speaker 1: you know they're using something.

170
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:06,186
Speaker 0: Oh, so get this total randomness.

171
00:10:06,509 --> 00:10:09,502
Speaker 0: Emily And I went to a jazz club last night that also had awesome barbecue.

172
00:10:09,562 --> 00:10:11,128
Speaker 0: you know that blue smoke barbecue place?

173
00:10:11,289 --> 00:10:12,536
Speaker 0: no Well, it's in.

174
00:10:12,617 --> 00:10:13,482
Speaker 0: it's like 28th Street.

175
00:10:13,502 --> 00:10:16,577
Speaker 0: They have awesome barbecue Underneath in the basement.

176
00:10:16,637 --> 00:10:18,529
Speaker 0: It's the same restaurant, but it's a jazz club.

177
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:22,486
Speaker 0: So you get the full meal, and you just eat it while they play jazz mm-hmm.

178
00:10:22,948 --> 00:10:23,209
Speaker 0: It was okay.

179
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:30,808
Speaker 0: It was kind of avant-garde you know guy in a saxophone going For like 20 minutes all righty.

180
00:10:31,150 --> 00:10:38,118
Speaker 0: But that aside on the way home right biggest fan of that as always the are came Much sooner than the end of the queue.

181
00:10:38,138 --> 00:10:41,130
Speaker 0: so we took the our home and in Queens Plaza station.

182
00:10:41,852 --> 00:10:47,630
Speaker 0: There was you know those white like four foot by three foot like metal doors that are always locked.

183
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:49,109
Speaker 0: They're just all over the place in the subway.

184
00:10:50,491 --> 00:10:53,402
Speaker 0: No, they're like steel plates that like their doors, and they aren't.

185
00:10:53,422 --> 00:10:53,924
Speaker 0: they lock.

186
00:10:54,406 --> 00:10:55,249
Speaker 0: one of them was just open.

187
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:56,878
Speaker 0: There's no one around.

188
00:10:57,261 --> 00:10:58,629
Speaker 0: so I crawled in there to take a look.

189
00:10:59,091 --> 00:10:59,793
Speaker 0: And there's there.

190
00:10:59,994 --> 00:11:05,010
Speaker 0: basically it was in the wall and the wall is all tiled and there's like ads and posters like a subway wall.

191
00:11:05,114 --> 00:11:09,760
Speaker 0: right Inside of this plate Was a crawlspace.

192
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:12,254
Speaker 0: it was about two and a half feet wide And it was just.

193
00:11:12,415 --> 00:11:14,708
Speaker 0: it was tall enough to walk in like a hallway any rats get you?

194
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:15,009
Speaker 0: nah.

195
00:11:15,412 --> 00:11:18,066
Speaker 0: And it was cleaned and it followed the entire length of the hallway.

196
00:11:18,086 --> 00:11:25,689
Speaker 0: You know what it was Another wall with old ass ads still in frames right behind it.

197
00:11:26,071 --> 00:11:32,310
Speaker 0: Uh-huh like they built another wall two feet in front of the original wall and left all the ads and everything in there.

198
00:11:32,671 --> 00:11:36,350
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I I can't figure out what the fuck the reason is for that.

199
00:11:36,451 --> 00:11:38,010
Speaker 0: But I gotta go back sometime at night.

200
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,390
Speaker 0: There was a guard kind of hanging out, and I saw that I was poking at it.

201
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:42,610
Speaker 0: So we left before he bothered us.

202
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:45,082
Speaker 0: I gotta go back when no one's looking and go in there and see what's up.

203
00:11:45,544 --> 00:11:46,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe take some videos.

204
00:11:46,851 --> 00:11:48,760
Speaker 1: It's probably just you know the structure of it.

205
00:11:48,820 --> 00:11:50,930
Speaker 1: It's like that's how they do you know yeah?

206
00:11:51,010 --> 00:12:00,149
Speaker 0: But they built a wall and the thing is it wasn't like that subway station is even that old and the wall in there was Relatively clean and new and there was just an even newer wall in front of it.

207
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:02,270
Speaker 1: How old were the ads in back there?

208
00:12:02,931 --> 00:12:03,876
Speaker 0: I gotta go back and look.

209
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:08,556
Speaker 0: they mean they look kind of faded at least a year or two Okay, but it was no.

210
00:12:08,596 --> 00:12:10,061
Speaker 0: It's not like 1940s.

211
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,586
Speaker 0: Burma shave something crazy.

212
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:13,949
Speaker 1: I was like yeah I was like is it Burma shave?

213
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:16,671
Speaker 1: It's like what the hell's back there.

214
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,253
Speaker 0: No casks of a Monti auto or anything.

215
00:12:19,653 --> 00:12:20,053
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

216
00:12:20,334 --> 00:12:29,220
Speaker 0: Oh well so things of the day.

217
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:30,705
Speaker 0: This one's real simple.

218
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:31,749
Speaker 0: It's a girl with a ball.

219
00:12:31,869 --> 00:12:32,913
Speaker 0: That's all all right.

220
00:12:33,093 --> 00:12:34,438
Speaker 0: It's pretty awesome actually.

221
00:12:34,779 --> 00:12:37,770
Speaker 1: yeah I think it's the best one ball juggling ever seen.

222
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,255
Speaker 0: I'd say so I want to see.

223
00:12:39,275 --> 00:12:40,720
Speaker 0: look Burj try to do something like that.

224
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:41,986
Speaker 1: I don't think he can.

225
00:12:42,006 --> 00:12:43,253
Speaker 0: no probably not.

226
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:44,118
Speaker 1: and now he's gonna cuz.

227
00:12:44,158 --> 00:12:47,944
Speaker 1: I challenge Whatever.

228
00:12:47,964 --> 00:12:51,059
Speaker 0: now he'll call a shit talk debt until we do some of the things we've talked about.

229
00:12:52,321 --> 00:13:02,055
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's a if you remember in the olden days of the old Prodigy the oldest prodigy for like IBM ps1 DOS prodigy.

230
00:13:02,557 --> 00:13:03,620
Speaker 0: I had that at school.

231
00:13:03,781 --> 00:13:05,232
Speaker 0: I never had that at home right?

232
00:13:05,394 --> 00:13:06,180
Speaker 1: I had friends who had it.

233
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:15,773
Speaker 1: They had IBM ps1 and they had because their dad worked at IBM still works at IBM and they had Prodigy on this IBM ps1 and is the oldest prodigy.

234
00:13:16,034 --> 00:13:19,585
Speaker 1: and there was a game you could play on it called madman Fuck mad maze.

235
00:13:19,907 --> 00:13:21,533
Speaker 0: that game sucked, but I loved it.

236
00:13:21,774 --> 00:13:22,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, no right.

237
00:13:22,577 --> 00:13:25,900
Speaker 1: There's the only game There was some other fun stuff to do was never winter nights.

238
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,817
Speaker 1: You had to pay for that, but mad maze is the best game on there.

239
00:13:28,837 --> 00:13:33,280
Speaker 0: pretty much I remember I would play mad maze, but and it was fine.

240
00:13:33,481 --> 00:13:38,524
Speaker 0: But I never beat it because I had a 2400 baud modem 2400 baud.

241
00:13:38,744 --> 00:13:41,714
Speaker 0: it would always time out before it finished saving my game.

242
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,500
Speaker 0: So I always had to start from the beginning.

243
00:13:44,363 --> 00:13:47,154
Speaker 0: That's when I gave up and started playing magic in the chat rooms instead.

244
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:47,736
Speaker 1: Yeah.

245
00:13:48,198 --> 00:14:01,023
Speaker 1: So anyway There's apparently this website at pages dot prodigy dot net something something where you can play mad maze 2 in your browser But you need to do some fiddling with your browser because it was designed This is made in 2001.

246
00:14:01,023 --> 00:14:04,694
Speaker 1: So it's made to work with like ie5 plus some.

247
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:10,499
Speaker 1: you might have to break out a virtual machine with Some old-ass windows 95 or something, you know to make this thing go.

248
00:14:11,183 --> 00:14:12,770
Speaker 1: But if you do that, you'll be all.

249
00:14:12,891 --> 00:14:16,750
Speaker 1: maybe Windows 98 would actually probably best But if you do that, you'll probably all set.

250
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:24,339
Speaker 1: I might actually work in ie6 I don't know, but it's not gonna work in your real modern browser unless you do some crazy hackage.

251
00:14:25,041 --> 00:14:28,715
Speaker 1: But otherwise, it's actually you can play mad maze - it's there.

252
00:14:28,735 --> 00:14:30,000
Speaker 1: It does work.

253
00:14:30,281 --> 00:14:32,456
Speaker 1: Damn, yeah, how about that?

254
00:14:32,638 --> 00:14:32,940
Speaker 0: All right.

255
00:14:33,261 --> 00:14:39,440
Speaker 0: So very briefly in the meta moment up next in the geek nights lineup is magfest in January.

256
00:14:40,242 --> 00:14:42,107
Speaker 0: We're doing one panel by our panel.

257
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:42,909
Speaker 0: losing should be fun.

258
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:50,222
Speaker 0: We're also now part of something called the mag nine mag nine Alright, and basically I do any other panels But one.

259
00:14:50,342 --> 00:14:54,560
Speaker 0: we're doing one panel and then we're going to split up and sit on some of all these other panel.

260
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:07,579
Speaker 0: They've got a whole bunch of pretty high-powered Awesome people in the gaming industry and they're gonna split us all up and sit on panels and talk about stuff I don't know how much I like, you know, the many people I like our panel doing.

261
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,588
Speaker 0: well We don't do panels.

262
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,819
Speaker 0: you realize what we do is lectures.

263
00:15:10,064 --> 00:15:10,700
Speaker 1: I know that's right.

264
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:13,673
Speaker 0: So I want to do are actually panels which I like being on.

265
00:15:13,693 --> 00:15:16,687
Speaker 0: because think of this if you've got a panel That's actually smart people.

266
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,979
Speaker 1: Well, I hope that it's not nine people on the panel.

267
00:15:19,362 --> 00:15:20,186
Speaker 0: It's gonna be four.

268
00:15:20,468 --> 00:15:29,467
Speaker 0: five absolute max is five mostly four Uh-huh, and they're gonna split it all up and like someone will be on like this one in this one depending on what they're interested In what they have stuff to say about that.

269
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:32,640
Speaker 0: That's what that thread that email thread your cc'd on is all about.

270
00:15:33,706 --> 00:15:35,536
Speaker 1: But yeah, I know why we only do one panel.

271
00:15:35,556 --> 00:15:36,199
Speaker 1: I'll do more panels.

272
00:15:36,501 --> 00:15:39,315
Speaker 0: That's all they want is to do is one panel which has to do one more.

273
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,280
Speaker 1: and why are we doing that one?

274
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,271
Speaker 1: We should do Game mechanics to make it was done instead.

275
00:15:43,673 --> 00:15:44,659
Speaker 0: now losing should be fun.

276
00:15:45,102 --> 00:15:48,115
Speaker 0: At least none of the people there have probably seen it and it's a good penalty.

277
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,092
Speaker 0: was that originally I also really wanted to do?

278
00:15:51,112 --> 00:15:52,420
Speaker 0: I don't know the Miku panel.

279
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,403
Speaker 0: I want to do everything.

280
00:15:53,464 --> 00:15:54,929
Speaker 1: so yeah, why did they?

281
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:58,060
Speaker 0: uh, anyway, it was that or beyond Candyland where the two they really wanted.

282
00:15:58,384 --> 00:16:01,489
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh Beyond Canada would have been real good.

283
00:16:01,509 --> 00:16:02,032
Speaker 1: We should done that.

284
00:16:02,254 --> 00:16:03,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we'll do it.

285
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:03,869
Speaker 0: You know what we could do.

286
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:07,673
Speaker 0: if people are interested We can just go find a spot and just do it like out in the hall.

287
00:16:07,693 --> 00:16:08,758
Speaker 0: So we need a projector.

288
00:16:08,819 --> 00:16:09,120
Speaker 1: It's weird.

289
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:11,287
Speaker 1: Then I'll buy a projector.

290
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:12,555
Speaker 0: No, it's a little handheld one.

291
00:16:12,595 --> 00:16:13,038
Speaker 1: That's all you.

292
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,166
Speaker 0: Also, we've got axes coming up.

293
00:16:16,306 --> 00:16:20,260
Speaker 1: axes in March get a hotel now or get a hotel yesterday.

294
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:22,590
Speaker 0: We've got anime Boston in April.

295
00:16:22,651 --> 00:16:23,052
Speaker 0: it's coming.

296
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:23,555
Speaker 0: we'll be there.

297
00:16:23,756 --> 00:16:24,660
Speaker 1: it's a while for now.

298
00:16:24,981 --> 00:16:26,967
Speaker 1: I think anime Boston panel reg went up.

299
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,913
Speaker 1: You can apply to get it beyond a panel.

300
00:16:29,094 --> 00:16:29,315
Speaker 1: Yes.

301
00:16:30,097 --> 00:16:30,519
Speaker 1: That's all you.

302
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:38,393
Speaker 1: And if so, anyone knows book club book is World War Z by Max Brooks is about zombies.

303
00:16:38,494 --> 00:16:39,699
Speaker 0: I'm so not looking forward to that.

304
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:44,459
Speaker 0: Okay, but also for anyone who's interested pecs East panel submissions are not yet up.

305
00:16:46,302 --> 00:16:47,151
Speaker 1: Hotels are though.

306
00:16:47,171 --> 00:16:47,899
Speaker 1: get a hotel room.

307
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:49,406
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you're gonna be fun.

308
00:16:49,427 --> 00:16:52,219
Speaker 0: from what I can read all the really close hotels are already sold out.

309
00:16:52,982 --> 00:16:59,300
Speaker 1: It's like that's what you get for not reaching immediately and I'm gonna tell immediately the hotel that we reg for sold out that day.

310
00:16:59,783 --> 00:17:01,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, why don't Pete like people just don't get it.

311
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,500
Speaker 1: It's like listen if you want to go if you have any interesting going whatsoever.

312
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,599
Speaker 1: No, no, you can cancel these things like a couple days beforehand.

313
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:10,122
Speaker 0: it's no.

314
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:16,819
Speaker 0: it's because of the cultures are different in packs because of the fact that you can just cancel and Because the fact that you can resell the badges.

315
00:17:17,262 --> 00:17:18,306
Speaker 0: People are the weird.

316
00:17:18,326 --> 00:17:19,329
Speaker 0: They're not as rushed.

317
00:17:19,371 --> 00:17:20,273
Speaker 0: They don't sell out as quick.

318
00:17:20,576 --> 00:17:21,599
Speaker 0: Look at Otacon hotels.

319
00:17:22,002 --> 00:17:23,632
Speaker 0: Those fuckers sell out almost immediately.

320
00:17:23,652 --> 00:17:24,980
Speaker 1: You just got to go immediately.

321
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:28,280
Speaker 0: Look at the artists alley it like Otacon it sells out like in second.

322
00:17:28,401 --> 00:17:30,260
Speaker 1: Listen people don't hesitate on this shit.

323
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:35,380
Speaker 1: If you want to go to San Diego Comic Con, you got to buy your badges for the next one at the current one.

324
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,305
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

325
00:17:36,586 --> 00:17:39,320
Speaker 1: You got to get your hotel room for the next one at the current one.

326
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:44,020
Speaker 1: All right, and if you can't plan that far ahead in advance then just don't even be disappointed.

327
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,727
Speaker 1: Just just be like, alright, I'm never going.

328
00:17:45,887 --> 00:17:48,980
Speaker 1: just pretend you're never going and just don't even think about it.

329
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,087
Speaker 1: No, I'm disappointed if you can't commit.

330
00:17:51,107 --> 00:17:54,680
Speaker 0: I have much more important advice delay delay delay.

331
00:17:55,205 --> 00:17:58,005
Speaker 0: Order your badges like the last minute like when they say they're gonna sell out.

332
00:17:58,266 --> 00:18:03,075
Speaker 0: wait until the last second get some cheapo hotel like a mile from the con because that Just makes it so much easier for me.

333
00:18:05,401 --> 00:18:12,788
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're gonna have a real terrible experience traveling back and forth to the con from faraway hotels and all that You know, don't be doing that.

334
00:18:12,909 --> 00:18:20,140
Speaker 0: The thing is at least with tax I mean with an anime con like Otacon or anime Boston even it's not like you can resell your badge easily.

335
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:24,594
Speaker 0: so a lot of people probably delay the pre-registration because they don't know if they're gonna go.

336
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:34,217
Speaker 0: and a lot of hotels at anime con specifically anime cons require large deposits and Such or even will require non-refundable deposits and a couple of conventions.

337
00:18:34,258 --> 00:18:41,500
Speaker 0: I've seen Are so prone to canceling rooms at the last second, man, and it's actually becoming a big problem.

338
00:18:41,581 --> 00:18:44,520
Speaker 0: But with packs you can totally just resell your badge.

339
00:18:44,601 --> 00:18:47,600
Speaker 0: So if you even consider for a second, you might go to pack.

340
00:18:47,921 --> 00:18:52,540
Speaker 0: There is no reason not to buy a badge because they will be trivial to sell that badge and you're already too slow.

341
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,626
Speaker 1: You should have gotten it a few days ago.

342
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,220
Speaker 0: Anyway, in fact, if you're a jerk you could scalp it and make some money.

343
00:18:56,361 --> 00:18:56,783
Speaker 0: Let's go.

344
00:18:56,803 --> 00:18:57,466
Speaker 1: Let's continue.

345
00:18:58,089 --> 00:18:59,033
Speaker 1: So tech news roundup.

346
00:18:59,174 --> 00:19:00,480
Speaker 0: tech news roundup.

347
00:19:00,821 --> 00:19:02,166
Speaker 1: So actually a lot of the new.

348
00:19:02,186 --> 00:19:05,923
Speaker 1: we haven't done this in a while and actually been light on tech news even light on Monday Shows.

349
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:08,160
Speaker 1: if it was Monday show ideas, let us know.

350
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,048
Speaker 0: So all you new listeners good Monday show ideas.

351
00:19:11,068 --> 00:19:15,300
Speaker 0: tech news roundup is code for rim and Scott didn't have shit to talk about.

352
00:19:15,781 --> 00:19:16,343
Speaker 1: That's right.

353
00:19:16,924 --> 00:19:21,076
Speaker 1: But there is at least one source of a ton of tech news slash dot.

354
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,700
Speaker 1: Well, no, I'm not talking about.

355
00:19:23,181 --> 00:19:24,946
Speaker 1: I'm talking about a thing right?

356
00:19:25,187 --> 00:19:30,140
Speaker 1: So Oracle they have done many things lately which have resulted in numerous news is in sequence.

357
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,806
Speaker 1: So this is pretty much three, right?

358
00:19:31,846 --> 00:19:33,873
Speaker 0: That was perhaps as vague as you could possibly be.

359
00:19:33,893 --> 00:19:35,318
Speaker 1: Okay, so the first thing right?

360
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,088
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, let me go through the whole story right.

361
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:39,111
Speaker 1: so my.

362
00:19:39,131 --> 00:19:41,619
Speaker 0: so there's a man named Larry Ellison, that's too far in.

363
00:19:43,521 --> 00:19:44,886
Speaker 0: So slash just as an aside.

364
00:19:44,906 --> 00:19:56,557
Speaker 0: slash dot pointed out because I don't like Larry Ellison and I really don't like Oracle and slash someone anonymous on slash dot I'm stealing their joke pointed out that Oracle actually stands for one rich asshole called Larry Ellison.

365
00:19:56,717 --> 00:19:57,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway continue.

366
00:19:57,801 --> 00:20:09,530
Speaker 1: So anyway, there's Sun Microsystems, right and recently Sun Microsystems bought MySQL and that put Java and MySQL And open star office all together under the same roof.

367
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:16,156
Speaker 0: three very important open source II things that suddenly are Under the nominal control also also virtual box.

368
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:22,020
Speaker 0: Ah shit Yeah, it's then but it was remember Oracle is a company that has a history of being dicks.

369
00:20:22,481 --> 00:20:24,007
Speaker 1: They're pretty much is the worst right?

370
00:20:24,027 --> 00:20:25,171
Speaker 1: I mean you think Microsoft is bad.

371
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:26,074
Speaker 1: now Oracle's the worst.

372
00:20:26,135 --> 00:20:27,419
Speaker 0: Microsoft fights against Oracle.

373
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:31,680
Speaker 0: It's kind of like watching two evil giants fighting and you don't really want either one of them to win.

374
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:36,876
Speaker 1: But you don't want I mean apples bad - it's like the three evil Google's standing up for us.

375
00:20:37,077 --> 00:20:40,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, barely So you've got.

376
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:42,537
Speaker 1: Oracle comes in and buys sons now.

377
00:20:42,597 --> 00:20:43,725
Speaker 1: It's like oh shit What's gonna happen?

378
00:20:43,745 --> 00:20:45,358
Speaker 1: all this good stuff that Sun was up to?

379
00:20:45,418 --> 00:20:50,647
Speaker 0: well I recall when all these newses were announced way back, you know That Oracle basically started owning all this stuff.

380
00:20:51,349 --> 00:20:56,892
Speaker 0: a lot the the posts on things like slashed out and digger about 50/50 half the nerds Saying this is the end.

381
00:20:56,912 --> 00:20:57,860
Speaker 0: We got to watch out.

382
00:20:57,880 --> 00:20:58,723
Speaker 0: They're gonna do evil stuff.

383
00:20:58,783 --> 00:21:01,012
Speaker 0: the other half people saying they haven't done anything.

384
00:21:01,133 --> 00:21:01,414
Speaker 0: evil.

385
00:21:01,715 --> 00:21:03,060
Speaker 0: Java is always gonna be Java.

386
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,309
Speaker 0: they're not gonna like close my SQL.

387
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:15,949
Speaker 1: and well, the first thing they did right is Apparently there was some sort of drama discussion among like the open office Leading people or so.

388
00:21:15,969 --> 00:21:17,234
Speaker 1: I don't even know what the hell they are.

389
00:21:17,294 --> 00:21:18,760
Speaker 0: But wasn't it the guiding board?

390
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:26,240
Speaker 1: I guess something like that and basically Oracle asked a bunch of the people on the board to leave for conflict of interest reasons.

391
00:21:26,382 --> 00:21:27,517
Speaker 1: Whatever it's like what?

392
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:30,140
Speaker 1: Something weird is going on there, right?

393
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:36,250
Speaker 1: I don't know what's up with that and it's like do they want to like Take open office and close it up or do something evil with it.

394
00:21:36,330 --> 00:21:42,590
Speaker 1: I don't know but it's not looking too good, but Luckily, it looks like.

395
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:43,295
Speaker 1: do you remember when?

396
00:21:45,463 --> 00:21:51,362
Speaker 1: X3 86 changed their license and was all evil and weird and then there was X or and then they just came out with X Or gonna.

397
00:21:51,402 --> 00:21:52,970
Speaker 1: no one uses x86 anymore.

398
00:21:52,990 --> 00:21:54,518
Speaker 1: I don't know if anyone's working on x86.

399
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,940
Speaker 0: It doesn't look like the same things happening here with LibreOffice.

400
00:21:58,221 --> 00:22:06,848
Speaker 1: yeah, basically all these things that Oracle is fucking up with their evilness are just getting forked and They're gonna be like X org, right?

401
00:22:06,888 --> 00:22:09,460
Speaker 1: So instead of open office, you're gonna use LibreOffice.

402
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:11,834
Speaker 1: No one's gonna think about open office anymore in a few years.

403
00:22:11,995 --> 00:22:12,719
Speaker 0: So what about my SQL?

404
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:20,260
Speaker 1: Well, there hasn't been any news about that later now, but there has been news about open Solaris Which also they pretty much just canceled it.

405
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:27,150
Speaker 1: It's like oh, yeah, we're Yeah, we're gonna just get rid of open Solaris, you know, it's done.

406
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:29,860
Speaker 1: We're gonna we're gonna go just stick with the commercial Solaris.

407
00:22:30,263 --> 00:22:32,358
Speaker 1: it's like well great guys, thanks a lot for that.

408
00:22:32,378 --> 00:22:36,702
Speaker 1: and the other thing is Java.

409
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,086
Speaker 1: there's some weirdness with Java.

410
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:41,536
Speaker 0: Well, it's particularly Java mobile because there's basically all.

411
00:22:41,576 --> 00:22:43,844
Speaker 1: no, it's actually no listen It's all Java's right?

412
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:46,855
Speaker 0: So I only know about the mobile thing with the the job.

413
00:22:46,936 --> 00:22:48,060
Speaker 1: It's all related.

414
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:57,981
Speaker 1: So basically the thing is is they decided with IBM, right that they're going to concentrate on all the Java standard edition Development.

415
00:22:58,021 --> 00:23:00,409
Speaker 1: concentration will be on the open JDK.

416
00:23:00,449 --> 00:23:01,633
Speaker 1: That's what they're gonna concentrate on.

417
00:23:01,653 --> 00:23:03,579
Speaker 1: and IBM was like, okay, let's do that, right?

418
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,485
Speaker 0: Wait now open JDK.

419
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:06,188
Speaker 0: That sounds great.

420
00:23:06,248 --> 00:23:06,730
Speaker 0: It's open.

421
00:23:07,031 --> 00:23:07,292
Speaker 1: It is.

422
00:23:07,312 --> 00:23:08,075
Speaker 1: Yeah.

423
00:23:08,477 --> 00:23:08,718
Speaker 1: Okay.

424
00:23:08,999 --> 00:23:09,260
Speaker 1: All right.

425
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,367
Speaker 1: But the thing is is goes like this right?

426
00:23:11,908 --> 00:23:16,121
Speaker 1: is IBM really likes to do Apache Foundation open source stuff Like they?

427
00:23:16,141 --> 00:23:25,955
Speaker 1: they're buddy buddy with that right like IBM hired the couch DB guy to and they couch DB went through the Apache Foundation, you know IBM's all about Apache Foundation open source.

428
00:23:26,356 --> 00:23:33,300
Speaker 1: So IBM was working on this thing called harmony, which is a Java implementation, right?

429
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:34,768
Speaker 1: that was in the Apache.

430
00:23:34,808 --> 00:23:41,352
Speaker 1: it's like the Apache Java basically and Harmony is what Android was using because Android is all Java.

431
00:23:41,473 --> 00:23:41,653
Speaker 1: eat.

432
00:23:42,094 --> 00:23:47,089
Speaker 1: if you do any Java Development for Android you're using harmony.

433
00:23:47,109 --> 00:23:50,060
Speaker 1: You're not using Sun Java or Oracle Java, right?

434
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:52,270
Speaker 1: You're using or open JDK using harmony.

435
00:23:52,773 --> 00:23:55,459
Speaker 0: No one uses the open JDK yet I don't know people use it.

436
00:23:56,322 --> 00:24:11,113
Speaker 1: So the thing is is because of this agreement with IBM and Oracle to concentrate an open JDK all the IBM employees Were working on harmony are now gonna work in open JDK instead Thus putting the Android Java in a shady place.

437
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:12,036
Speaker 1: because now what they're gonna?

438
00:24:12,057 --> 00:24:13,000
Speaker 1: they're still using harmony.

439
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,066
Speaker 1: So what the hell are they gonna do?

440
00:24:14,287 --> 00:24:21,700
Speaker 0: See I read a much more sinister story talking about how Oracle is now claiming to that Android's virtual machine that basically they didn't want.

441
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:26,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're making some lawsuits because the mobile edition there was encumbered and I think there was even some cost involved.

442
00:24:27,081 --> 00:24:35,730
Speaker 0: So instead Google has Dalvik which is their Java virtual machine to run on Android and Oracle is now saying Yeah that infringes in all our patents.

443
00:24:35,851 --> 00:24:36,979
Speaker 0: We're gonna sue the fuck out of you.

444
00:24:37,221 --> 00:24:40,898
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know Oracle's is basically getting all evil and people are gonna have to.

445
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:44,008
Speaker 1: just you know Java was already has a bunch of alternative.

446
00:24:44,028 --> 00:24:48,219
Speaker 0: apparently mobile Java actually was not included when Java was opened up.

447
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:50,339
Speaker 0: Mobile Java was not open.

448
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:53,932
Speaker 0: Google said fine We'll make our own and then we get to the problem.

449
00:24:53,952 --> 00:24:55,118
Speaker 0: and actually this leads into my.

450
00:24:55,199 --> 00:25:00,755
Speaker 0: the news I want to talk about next is the patent lawsuit clusterfuck that is smartphones and cameras.

451
00:25:00,975 --> 00:25:03,968
Speaker 1: No, well is everything Technological.

452
00:25:04,049 --> 00:25:05,000
Speaker 0: Yep, but think of this.

453
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:13,360
Speaker 0: So basically Google did something innovative and new on their own But they may or may not have infringed upon a whole bunch of ultra-broad patents that Oracle has.

454
00:25:13,662 --> 00:25:17,020
Speaker 0: So Oracle can sue them to prevent competition in the phone world.

455
00:25:17,201 --> 00:25:23,620
Speaker 0: As far as I can tell everyone who makes phones and make software has sued everyone who makes phones and make software.

456
00:25:23,961 --> 00:25:28,880
Speaker 0: There's a funny graphic online that the only flaw and it shows like all the clusters and all the lawsuit lines.

457
00:25:29,323 --> 00:25:31,460
Speaker 0: The only problem with that graphic is doesn't show all the lawsuits.

458
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:38,800
Speaker 1: Usually from what I've read is the way this works right is everyone gets a ridiculous number of patents And the reason they get him is for defense, right?

459
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:48,680
Speaker 1: It's like I'll infringe your patents and you infringe mine But if you go too far as long as we're sort of both have a ton of patents It would be mutually assured destruction, right?

460
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,549
Speaker 1: So we're just not gonna.

461
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:50,499
Speaker 1: everyone's gonna be chill.

462
00:25:51,002 --> 00:25:55,080
Speaker 1: But then it is, you know, so that no one actually goes after anyone big time.

463
00:25:55,161 --> 00:25:57,060
Speaker 1: They only go after when there's a slight advantage.

464
00:25:57,100 --> 00:26:02,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, because or when there's a really strong patent or something like that say I'm IBM in your Oracle sure say I find out.

465
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,988
Speaker 0: Oh, they're violating like 50 of our patents.

466
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:06,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we might be violating like 50 of theirs.

467
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,786
Speaker 0: It'll be a giant lawsuit.

468
00:26:08,148 --> 00:26:10,220
Speaker 0: and when elephants fight, it's the grass that suffers.

469
00:26:13,722 --> 00:26:17,134
Speaker 1: So, yeah, the grass is the grass is suffering right now, I don't think it is.

470
00:26:17,274 --> 00:26:18,960
Speaker 1: actually I think what's gonna happen those.

471
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,913
Speaker 1: We're gonna have a whole bunch of X org situations.

472
00:26:20,933 --> 00:26:22,060
Speaker 1: We're gonna library office.

473
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:23,206
Speaker 1: There's gonna be some.

474
00:26:23,608 --> 00:26:34,018
Speaker 1: one of the Java's is gonna stand out as the Java Right and all the people are gonna go to one Java to rule them all, you know Maybe one of the MySQL forks will stand out, you know virtual box.

475
00:26:34,058 --> 00:26:35,484
Speaker 0: Yeah You know what's gonna stand out.

476
00:26:35,504 --> 00:26:39,177
Speaker 0: the database world post grass, you know, the new post grass has replication.

477
00:26:39,218 --> 00:26:39,840
Speaker 0: that fucking works.

478
00:26:40,002 --> 00:26:45,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's still post grass Like post grass.

479
00:26:45,271 --> 00:26:45,372
Speaker 0: it's

480
00:26:45,432 --> 00:26:52,700
Speaker 1: a pain in the ass to use You know and virtual box so far is still Goes on it, but otherwise, it's still good

481
00:26:52,740 --> 00:27:25,619
Speaker 0: I think something for more fundamentals in the works because it's interesting that the patent lawsuits in particular About a third of them as far as I can tell our hardware patents on fairly legitimate Awesome things that companies did and the other two-thirds are patents like my patent Like and a lot of them are oh, yeah this software thing on a phone On two phones networked and I think The end result of the clusterfuck of reality is that if they don't all start settling with each other or?

482
00:27:26,761 --> 00:27:40,199
Speaker 0: If we get patent trolls that go in grenade style like a company that gets one patent Or like member SEO Yeah, anyone who goes in with one patent and says we're just gonna broadside you bring it on.

483
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:47,560
Speaker 0: Nobody wants that because when that happens Courts will start to do something about it.

484
00:27:47,881 --> 00:28:03,160
Speaker 0: If all these lawsuits go through and none of them settle out of court the courts are gonna have to start invalidating patents on one side of the other or doing massive damages and all it does is point out more and more to even people Who don't care the obvious flaws with the entire patent system that we have today.

485
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,365
Speaker 1: Well, I heard that what's gonna happen soon is they're gonna start having like public Things for patents.

486
00:28:09,426 --> 00:28:09,928
Speaker 1: They're like it's.

487
00:28:09,988 --> 00:28:21,548
Speaker 1: it's very likely that what's gonna happen is when there's a patent they're gonna put it out there before it's approved and Just people like you and me will be able to relatively easily You know with a little bit of bureaucracy.

488
00:28:21,628 --> 00:28:23,797
Speaker 0: I could go and validate my own goddamn patent.

489
00:28:23,817 --> 00:28:27,888
Speaker 1: You just basically Allow you to submit prior arts, right?

490
00:28:27,969 --> 00:28:31,520
Speaker 1: So if you can go find prior arts you can submit them eventually maybe soon.

491
00:28:31,781 --> 00:28:38,539
Speaker 0: So if I were a company that relies upon this giant patent, I would hire someone to just find prior arts.

492
00:28:38,982 --> 00:28:46,272
Speaker 0: I would also hire someone to flood the system with penises Thus preventing them from actually validating any of the real prior.

493
00:28:46,975 --> 00:28:56,260
Speaker 0: on my pens, maybe I Mean you've got some patent on like imaging a system to rebuild it with a new MAC address and dynamic DNS.

494
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,911
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then the prior art is.

495
00:28:58,153 --> 00:28:59,120
Speaker 0: here's a picture of my penis.

496
00:28:59,401 --> 00:29:05,399
Speaker 1: I think the thing to just take away from this is that watch out for anything that Sun used to own that Oracle now owns because they're evil.

497
00:29:05,419 --> 00:29:08,920
Speaker 1: and If you're gonna use anything that is in that category, right?

498
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,760
Speaker 1: You might want to look for like the up-and-coming replacement project and use that instead, you know?

499
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:17,340
Speaker 1: Maybe use LibreOffice instead of open office or use a B word.

500
00:29:17,842 --> 00:29:19,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know that's only word processor.

501
00:29:19,788 --> 00:29:24,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, but the Google Docs at least, you know, it's look for Alternatives to those things.

502
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:33,236
Speaker 1: if you have to if you can, you know Maybe you'll be better off in long run if Oracle gets progressively more evil as time goes on.

503
00:29:33,638 --> 00:29:34,540
Speaker 0: So there's the story.

504
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,845
Speaker 0: I only want to talk about this briefly.

505
00:29:35,885 --> 00:29:49,360
Speaker 0: but Dutch hotels under this law that may or may not be passed May have to register as ISPs and then be subject to all the regulation that ISPs are Like data regulation everything just because of the shitty way the laws are written.

506
00:29:49,526 --> 00:29:50,568
Speaker 1: No It's terrible.

507
00:29:50,588 --> 00:30:04,040
Speaker 0: and now imagine that If a hotel that just offers like free Wi-Fi to the people at the hotel has to register as an ISP into all this data retention Theoretically like some store that just wants to offer free Wi-Fi has to do the same thing.

508
00:30:04,442 --> 00:30:04,804
Speaker 0: All this.

509
00:30:04,965 --> 00:30:07,816
Speaker 1: this would basically say offer free Wi-Fi at my house I have to do it too.

510
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:12,377
Speaker 0: This would basically say it's illegal to offer Wi-Fi because it'll be too kind of like what I'm trying to do.

511
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:26,580
Speaker 0: our e-commerce Properly Following the law is so much more expensive and so much more difficult than breaking the law And in fact if the more we follow the law The more likely we are to accidentally break it and be noticed than if we just never follow the law in the first place.

512
00:30:26,761 --> 00:30:41,660
Speaker 0: yeah, but I point this out one because I think that's been bothering me lately is that half the laws we have related to anything internet were written in the 80s and Literally make no sense at all in light of any modern technology.

513
00:30:42,042 --> 00:30:46,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, and - and that's why people just break the law like with piracy and such because it's like.

514
00:30:46,319 --> 00:30:48,027
Speaker 1: well The law is completely meaningless.

515
00:30:48,047 --> 00:30:49,735
Speaker 1: It's so out of the judges don't understand it.

516
00:30:49,875 --> 00:30:50,860
Speaker 0: Why should I understand it?

517
00:30:51,301 --> 00:30:53,171
Speaker 1: Why should I even bother?

518
00:30:53,191 --> 00:30:54,899
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna do what I know is best.

519
00:30:55,120 --> 00:31:01,040
Speaker 0: I mean look at how hard it is to even convince tech people that net neutrality is a problem or not a problem.

520
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:07,459
Speaker 0: But anyway, the other thing I want to point out is that the United States does not have a monopoly on internet law.

521
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,966
Speaker 0: bullshit This is Dutch.

522
00:31:09,086 --> 00:31:10,212
Speaker 0: This is not American.

523
00:31:10,232 --> 00:31:11,117
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

524
00:31:11,177 --> 00:31:17,180
Speaker 1: No by no I mean if anything the US actually has not the work anywhere near the worst internet law.

525
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:19,155
Speaker 1: Look at how many places are all censoring right?

526
00:31:19,196 --> 00:31:23,213
Speaker 1: Look at how There was a. there was a URL shortener not bitly.

527
00:31:23,273 --> 00:31:24,579
Speaker 1: but another one that ended with ly.

528
00:31:24,881 --> 00:31:25,826
Speaker 0: Okay, and it was.

529
00:31:25,866 --> 00:31:27,878
Speaker 0: it was aimed at porn.

530
00:31:27,898 --> 00:31:30,067
Speaker 1: basically Yeah, is he a porn URL shortener?

531
00:31:30,168 --> 00:31:31,534
Speaker 0: only who would need that?

532
00:31:31,694 --> 00:31:40,760
Speaker 1: and because they registered In ly You are a length right, which is Libya, but I'm right qaddafi totally shut them down.

533
00:31:41,363 --> 00:31:43,213
Speaker 0: So they just was it actually qaddafi.

534
00:31:43,273 --> 00:31:44,500
Speaker 1: Well, no, but it was Libya, you know.

535
00:31:44,560 --> 00:31:50,018
Speaker 1: So they just lost their domain and it's like whoa bitly could just lose their domain and he any time.

536
00:31:50,058 --> 00:31:52,286
Speaker 0: because look At the same time.

537
00:31:52,687 --> 00:31:56,720
Speaker 1: I'm almost okay with remember that happened with goat C CX just the canary island.

538
00:31:56,800 --> 00:32:09,890
Speaker 0: It was ever one reason our TLDR Not TLDR our top-level domain system and the DNS in general is kind of broken in that people are just using Designations that weren't intended for those uses.

539
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:13,100
Speaker 0: I mean ly was intended for Libya and we're using it because it's clever.

540
00:32:13,662 --> 00:32:15,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, CX was clever.

541
00:32:15,249 --> 00:32:19,367
Speaker 1: It's you know, you're not actually from the Canary Islands Yeah, and a long time.

542
00:32:19,387 --> 00:32:22,399
Speaker 0: I mean you used to actually have to be a nonprofit to get a dot org.

543
00:32:23,142 --> 00:32:26,033
Speaker 0: Yeah, daddy to you is still pretty tightly controlled.

544
00:32:26,314 --> 00:32:28,020
Speaker 0: calm, whatever men, whatever.

545
00:32:28,522 --> 00:32:31,774
Speaker 0: Yeah gov int int is the one people don't even know exists.

546
00:32:32,095 --> 00:32:33,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know how to get an int.

547
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:33,984
Speaker 0: I don't know if I could.

548
00:32:34,004 --> 00:32:34,910
Speaker 1: yeah, I don't know either.

549
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:38,865
Speaker 0: the UN has one as far as I can tell but you know It's like.

550
00:32:39,367 --> 00:32:47,840
Speaker 1: it is true that they're making a mockery of the top-level domains But at the same time it's like you think about this right bitly, you know, they need the short URL, right?

551
00:32:47,981 --> 00:32:48,910
Speaker 1: That's the whole thing.

552
00:32:48,950 --> 00:32:57,908
Speaker 1: if they added another character Like well what we should put in by a quest to have a new top-level domain that is just like Zed Mm-hmm and just that might exist.

553
00:32:57,948 --> 00:32:58,772
Speaker 0: and that's the official.

554
00:32:58,973 --> 00:32:59,476
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

555
00:32:59,536 --> 00:33:02,951
Speaker 1: They're usually two letters It's anyway, the other thing though is that they've already.

556
00:33:03,152 --> 00:33:04,840
Speaker 1: there's already all these bitly URLs.

557
00:33:05,362 --> 00:33:06,808
Speaker 1: So if they yoink those expire.

558
00:33:06,828 --> 00:33:07,812
Speaker 0: what do you mean?

559
00:33:07,892 --> 00:33:09,860
Speaker 0: I thought I thought they eventually got reused and expired.

560
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:10,644
Speaker 0: I don't think they last forever.

561
00:33:10,664 --> 00:33:11,429
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

562
00:33:11,509 --> 00:33:12,434
Speaker 0: I don't think they last forever.

563
00:33:12,475 --> 00:33:13,380
Speaker 1: I think they last forever.

564
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,115
Speaker 1: So if they go yoink that's like gonna ruin like this whole.

565
00:33:19,196 --> 00:33:22,091
Speaker 1: that's gonna like just make 404 is all over the internet.

566
00:33:22,131 --> 00:33:22,916
Speaker 0: Well that it should.

567
00:33:22,996 --> 00:33:23,398
Speaker 0: here's the thing.

568
00:33:24,062 --> 00:33:33,918
Speaker 0: It'll it should if people were smart if people were responsible internet citizens It should only affect fucking Twitter if you're using bitly on your blog to link to stuff.

569
00:33:33,958 --> 00:33:34,620
Speaker 0: You're stupid.

570
00:33:35,884 --> 00:33:37,940
Speaker 1: A lot of people are using bitly and they shouldn't play.

571
00:33:38,042 --> 00:33:43,660
Speaker 1: No The reason is not because they want to shorten the URL but because bitly provides tracking for you.

572
00:33:43,861 --> 00:33:45,795
Speaker 0: Well, you can do the tracking yourself trivially.

573
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:49,888
Speaker 1: You're running Apache Yeah, but that's a lot more work than just having bitly do it.

574
00:33:50,370 --> 00:33:53,118
Speaker 0: Ah, I have no sympathy for plus.

575
00:33:53,178 --> 00:33:55,527
Speaker 1: a lot of people Remember, we're sort of weird, right?

576
00:33:55,548 --> 00:33:59,523
Speaker 1: We actually have an actual hosting where we control a true A lot of people are like.

577
00:33:59,563 --> 00:34:04,500
Speaker 1: most people are using like wordpress.com or they're using like dreamhost where you can't control shit.

578
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:06,147
Speaker 1: You can't control your Apache server.

579
00:34:06,368 --> 00:34:17,060
Speaker 0: You basically put files in a folder and you can maybe But at the same time the only people who need that sort of tracking are people who are trying to sell ads anyway.

580
00:34:17,362 --> 00:34:18,551
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't care any mind.

581
00:34:18,591 --> 00:34:19,719
Speaker 0: Okay, I doubly don't care.

582
00:34:20,202 --> 00:34:23,260
Speaker 1: But I mean the point is that all these links on Twitter who's just gonna be broken?

583
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:27,214
Speaker 0: You realize whenever I can I give raw URLs on Twitter.

584
00:34:27,495 --> 00:34:31,349
Speaker 1: We're also using bitly a lot too Yeah, so our Twitter would be broken.

585
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:34,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, our Twitter would be but not our RSS feed.

586
00:34:34,121 --> 00:34:36,159
Speaker 0: We don't have bitly links in the feed burner.

587
00:34:36,472 --> 00:34:37,744
Speaker 1: No but it's you know, it's still.

588
00:34:37,804 --> 00:34:39,712
Speaker 1: it's pretty it's pretty bad and it's also.

589
00:34:39,752 --> 00:34:46,600
Speaker 1: a lot of people have jobs at bitly and have invested in bitly and if the domain is pretty much This place I work is the same thing.

590
00:34:46,659 --> 00:34:48,568
Speaker 1: I work at broadway.com at our.

591
00:34:48,629 --> 00:34:51,280
Speaker 1: the domain is pretty much our whole company at the same time.

592
00:34:52,022 --> 00:34:53,005
Speaker 0: You know, there's hope.

593
00:34:53,045 --> 00:34:54,951
Speaker 0: there's people who work at bitly and they're reliant upon.

594
00:34:55,172 --> 00:34:57,820
Speaker 0: they're relying upon the fact that their URL is from Libya.

595
00:34:58,303 --> 00:35:00,760
Speaker 0: They should have known that when they got but it's too late now.

596
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:09,519
Speaker 0: Actually, I went to bitly to see stuff just to try to figure out if they ever expire.

597
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:14,139
Speaker 0: and For some reason the only link I see is a geek nights link.

598
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:17,570
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't know why it's showing me that on the front page.

599
00:35:17,591 --> 00:35:18,876
Speaker 0: All right, I've never.

600
00:35:18,996 --> 00:35:19,840
Speaker 0: I never used bitly.

601
00:35:20,902 --> 00:35:22,836
Speaker 1: All right, let me let me say check it out.

602
00:35:22,936 --> 00:35:23,379
Speaker 0: It's just weird.

603
00:35:24,683 --> 00:35:25,388
Speaker 1: Are you logged in?

604
00:35:25,408 --> 00:35:26,900
Speaker 0: No, I don't have a bitly account.

605
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:29,910
Speaker 1: I'm logged in as geek nights on bitly.

606
00:35:30,251 --> 00:35:32,240
Speaker 0: I'm not logged in as geek nights on bit.

607
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:32,822
Speaker 1: What does it say?

608
00:35:32,842 --> 00:35:34,790
Speaker 1: at the very top it says bitly.

609
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,508
Speaker 1: to the right where it says sign in and sign out It says sign in or sign up.

610
00:35:38,931 --> 00:35:40,480
Speaker 1: It doesn't say hi geek night sign out.

611
00:35:40,580 --> 00:35:42,910
Speaker 0: No, all right, and then under shorten your long links.

612
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:44,034
Speaker 0: It shows one link.

613
00:35:44,094 --> 00:35:45,018
Speaker 0: That is the geek nights link.

614
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:48,385
Speaker 1: But let me click at it and find out.

615
00:35:48,505 --> 00:35:51,212
Speaker 0: yeah, it takes us to the vanilla farms episode a1 b2 c3.

616
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:56,943
Speaker 1: Ah Don't know What's the?

617
00:35:57,023 --> 00:35:58,008
Speaker 1: what is the bitly link?

618
00:35:58,149 --> 00:36:04,722
Speaker 0: I have a thing that turns bitly links into non bitly link see a KQCI Uh-huh.

619
00:36:04,742 --> 00:36:06,387
Speaker 1: I don't know where you're seeing this.

620
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:07,150
Speaker 1: I'll have to look later.

621
00:36:07,451 --> 00:36:08,474
Speaker 1: All right, just keep it open.

622
00:36:08,655 --> 00:36:13,160
Speaker 0: Anyway, crazy meta aside My writing I just have little sympathy.

623
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,659
Speaker 0: I mean This is part of the problem.

624
00:36:15,081 --> 00:36:22,300
Speaker 0: Bitly is using Libya because we really didn't think our TLD system through to handle a modern infrastructure.

625
00:36:23,164 --> 00:36:30,964
Speaker 0: But at the same time I'm not gonna be one of those You know freshmen and IT at a tech school who will you know be in class learning how DNS works like yeah This is stupid.

626
00:36:31,165 --> 00:36:36,440
Speaker 0: We should use something new and modern which is code for I don't understand it And I can't be asked to read the documentation.

627
00:36:37,842 --> 00:36:39,788
Speaker 1: All Right, what are their?

628
00:36:39,848 --> 00:36:40,151
Speaker 1: what are their?

629
00:36:40,231 --> 00:36:40,433
Speaker 1: tech?

630
00:36:40,473 --> 00:36:41,300
Speaker 1: news has happened.

631
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:47,460
Speaker 0: Well, there was the announcement that Google had been testing autonomous robot cars for some time now.

632
00:36:47,561 --> 00:36:48,266
Speaker 1: I mean that's not.

633
00:36:48,366 --> 00:36:49,051
Speaker 1: I mean there have been.

634
00:36:49,071 --> 00:36:53,472
Speaker 1: I've been when I was in high school You could watch TV and there would be shows about robot cars.

635
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:54,837
Speaker 0: Yes, but none of them really worked.

636
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:58,625
Speaker 1: I mean in College there were kids making robot.

637
00:36:58,746 --> 00:37:03,760
Speaker 0: Yes, but they worked in such controlled situations and didn't work at all outside of those situations.

638
00:37:04,021 --> 00:37:05,971
Speaker 0: They worked on empty roads that were straight.

639
00:37:06,252 --> 00:37:07,940
Speaker 0: they worked on predefined courses.

640
00:37:08,341 --> 00:37:11,952
Speaker 0: They worked in like these pathetic, you know, like proof of concepts.

641
00:37:12,374 --> 00:37:23,871
Speaker 0: Google kind of came out and they've actually you know they hire dudes apparently 15 bucks an hour to sit in the cars and just be ready to take over if they go apeshit and They're able to drive in city traffic on freeways thousands of miles.

642
00:37:23,912 --> 00:37:29,268
Speaker 1: Apparently all these even where the roads are really weird Other cars are doing really weird.

643
00:37:29,288 --> 00:37:31,960
Speaker 0: You know, they were testing these just downtown San Francisco.

644
00:37:32,422 --> 00:37:35,358
Speaker 1: All right, the driving's not too bad there it is is it?

645
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:35,699
Speaker 1: yeah?

646
00:37:36,141 --> 00:37:38,993
Speaker 1: But I mean like, you know, what if other cars do weird stuff?

647
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:40,118
Speaker 1: the Google car still works.

648
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:50,540
Speaker 0: supposedly They do and all this time only one was involved in an accident for the many thousand whatever miles they've driven and that accident It was stopped at a red light and someone rear-ended it.

649
00:37:50,922 --> 00:37:51,303
Speaker 1: I mean like.

650
00:37:51,344 --> 00:37:54,780
Speaker 1: what if like the road is just really weird where you know, this is out west.

651
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,511
Speaker 1: I mean, how would it do on an East Road right East Coast?

652
00:37:57,531 --> 00:37:59,820
Speaker 1: The roads are old and very weird out west.

653
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,050
Speaker 1: They're a lot more grid like and you know easy to pattern.

654
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:05,117
Speaker 0: San Francisco's pretty shitty to drive in.

655
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:11,840
Speaker 1: from all the tell I've seen on the I mean, maybe they can deal with other cars But they're still not dealing with weird northeast old roads not yet.

656
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:18,226
Speaker 0: but the point is that what Google showed and demonstrated at least is Leaps and bounds beyond.

657
00:38:18,267 --> 00:38:20,297
Speaker 0: the last time there was big news about robot cars.

658
00:38:20,438 --> 00:38:20,880
Speaker 1: that is true.

659
00:38:21,201 --> 00:38:29,240
Speaker 0: And I think within our lifetime you and me we will see Autonomous or at least semi autonomous robot cars on the streets for real.

660
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:35,080
Speaker 0: Yes, which will be great when we're old because then I don't have to deal with the problem of I'm too old to drive safely.

661
00:38:35,145 --> 00:38:39,540
Speaker 1: And yeah It'd be great now cuz I could go somewhere without having anyone have to drive.

662
00:38:39,641 --> 00:38:42,155
Speaker 1: We can have four seats facing the middle and play board game.

663
00:38:42,175 --> 00:38:49,893
Speaker 0: if I had a robot car I would pay whatever it took to own a car and have it parked in this building and every con I just get in the car and say take me to Otacon.

664
00:38:49,933 --> 00:38:50,516
Speaker 0: That's right.

665
00:38:50,656 --> 00:38:51,380
Speaker 0: Maybe not Otacon.

666
00:38:52,421 --> 00:38:53,325
Speaker 0: Take me to PAX.

667
00:38:53,887 --> 00:38:56,097
Speaker 1: I would take you to Seattle when you wanted to go to Boston.

668
00:38:56,237 --> 00:39:01,011
Speaker 0: Yeah Course maybe it'll be like ex-driver.

669
00:39:01,051 --> 00:39:06,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, robot cars are awesome And really any Luddites just need to STFU right if anyone's like.

670
00:39:07,014 --> 00:39:08,438
Speaker 1: no again, I don't trust it.

671
00:39:08,458 --> 00:39:09,040
Speaker 1: It's dangerous.

672
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,460
Speaker 1: It's like it's not any more dangerous than your shitty driving.

673
00:39:11,701 --> 00:39:17,098
Speaker 1: I think human error is way more dangerous than even flawed computers.

674
00:39:17,118 --> 00:39:23,300
Speaker 0: two points One of the biggest killers of humans in the world today at least world is car accidents.

675
00:39:23,801 --> 00:39:33,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, and to think about the fuel economy of robot cars that can autonomously form road trains on the freeway Yeah, and the fact that you know, they don't drive like morons.

676
00:39:33,475 --> 00:39:34,580
Speaker 1: everyone has robot cars.

677
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:39,702
Speaker 1: There'll be a lot less traffic because the cars will just be like an inch from each other all going at the maximum possible Speed.

678
00:39:39,943 --> 00:39:42,070
Speaker 0: and here, you know mass transit works.

679
00:39:42,211 --> 00:39:50,334
Speaker 0: in very dense centers like in New York City Our subway system works because all the jobs are in one place and all the people are in a couple of places and the subways Just work.

680
00:39:51,341 --> 00:39:56,419
Speaker 0: Mass transit despite the dreams of a lot of people who want it to be is not feasible in most of the country

681
00:39:56,579 --> 00:39:58,495
Speaker 1: unless Everyone moves which they should yeah

682
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,124
Speaker 0: But it won't be ever

683
00:40:00,305 --> 00:40:04,420
Speaker 1: unless every state becomes a country and then all the states that aren't feasible will go bankrupt.

684
00:40:04,561 --> 00:40:05,605
Speaker 0: I don't have to leave them.

685
00:40:05,685 --> 00:40:09,520
Speaker 0: mass transit like Detroit doesn't service even in like New York mass trans.

686
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,143
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

687
00:40:10,484 --> 00:40:14,240
Speaker 0: Unless you want to go a couple of miles to the left or right of where the mass transit goes.

688
00:40:14,306 --> 00:40:19,160
Speaker 1: Yeah There are certain places like you just can't get right like if I had to go to the UPS of the FedEx in mass.

689
00:40:19,862 --> 00:40:26,300
Speaker 1: Like if you don't drive there like there is a subway stop, but it's not close and the bus goes there.

690
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,203
Speaker 1: But it's a shitty.

691
00:40:27,243 --> 00:40:29,551
Speaker 1: you got to take like two or three buses and it's real.

692
00:40:29,592 --> 00:40:30,294
Speaker 1: I just bike there.

693
00:40:30,334 --> 00:40:30,956
Speaker 1: It's way easier.

694
00:40:31,017 --> 00:40:34,670
Speaker 1: macadamia Mean macadamia gazebo on the bus.

695
00:40:34,710 --> 00:40:40,828
Speaker 0: Yeah the bus bus bus But even more The like.

696
00:40:40,849 --> 00:40:40,990
Speaker 0: what?

697
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:41,737
Speaker 0: I want to go skiing.

698
00:40:42,701 --> 00:40:44,971
Speaker 0: Who would ever make a train that goes to Hunter Mountain?

699
00:40:45,212 --> 00:40:45,734
Speaker 1: nobody.

700
00:40:46,336 --> 00:40:47,120
Speaker 0: so I got to take the bus.

701
00:40:47,261 --> 00:40:48,671
Speaker 0: You know what the bus sucks.

702
00:40:48,792 --> 00:40:52,993
Speaker 0: every time I've been to Hunter Mountain I will see that bus pull up after I've been skiing for like an hour.

703
00:40:53,013 --> 00:40:54,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, it just gets you there late.

704
00:40:55,062 --> 00:41:03,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hate that shit and it's like 80 bucks a person what it's cheaper If I'm going with more than one other person it is cheaper to rent a car for the entire weekend.

705
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:04,123
Speaker 0: That is to take.

706
00:41:04,163 --> 00:41:07,014
Speaker 1: that car is a ripoff and that's still cheaper.

707
00:41:07,234 --> 00:41:08,720
Speaker 0: Yeah zip car is not that bad.

708
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:09,604
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about getting it.

709
00:41:09,625 --> 00:41:12,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I would get if it was less money.

710
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:16,880
Speaker 1: It's still way too much money because like I wouldn't use it most of the time and you paying even if you're not using.

711
00:41:17,082 --> 00:41:19,440
Speaker 0: I looked into it actually for how much I rent cars.

712
00:41:19,762 --> 00:41:23,120
Speaker 0: It would be useful because when I go skiing I have to rent a car.

713
00:41:23,442 --> 00:41:25,153
Speaker 0: I have to run a car like five times every winter.

714
00:41:25,213 --> 00:41:26,199
Speaker 0: It's already used worth it?

715
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:27,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't I wouldn't use it that much.

716
00:41:27,889 --> 00:41:28,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz you don't go skiing.

717
00:41:28,975 --> 00:41:29,920
Speaker 1: I would use it a lot less.

718
00:41:30,422 --> 00:41:33,839
Speaker 0: I also might use it to go to like kinetic on rather than I don't know what we're gonna do.

719
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:40,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's like that's when I would use it which is like what when one's twice a year, you know, it's not a lot Right.

720
00:41:40,436 --> 00:41:51,404
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, the other thing is that in general if we had robot cars It solves so many societal problems that you wouldn't even think about like getting kids to school and dealing with buses And you

721
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:54,504
Speaker 1: just have the kids get in the car and you can say car go to school Yeah,

722
00:41:54,846 --> 00:41:55,289
Speaker 0: and old and

723
00:41:55,329 --> 00:41:56,779
Speaker 1: then the car would just drive itself home.

724
00:41:58,201 --> 00:41:59,466
Speaker 0: We don't need taxis anymore.

725
00:41:59,988 --> 00:42:03,020
Speaker 1: Maybe robot taxis the driver on all the taxi workers would be out of work.

726
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:03,703
Speaker 0: That's fine.

727
00:42:04,226 --> 00:42:06,075
Speaker 1: All the any bridge any chauffeur would be out of work.

728
00:42:06,196 --> 00:42:17,120
Speaker 1: Yeah now I feel like really rich people would demand to have human Robots anyway only really old people who didn't trust the robot cars and we just had to make human driving on roads illegal.

729
00:42:17,763 --> 00:42:22,000
Speaker 1: I guess I'm just and only only human drivers and races and other situations like that.

730
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:25,720
Speaker 0: Well, I think there'll be a transition where what we'd have to do is just phase in the robot cars.

731
00:42:25,981 --> 00:42:27,427
Speaker 1: That's the one the new engines got.

732
00:42:27,669 --> 00:42:29,597
Speaker 1: the Jetsons had flying cars that you drove.

733
00:42:29,657 --> 00:42:30,079
Speaker 1: It's like what?

734
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:32,927
Speaker 1: X over had non flying cars.

735
00:42:33,047 --> 00:42:36,320
Speaker 0: I saw Elroy get into a car in one episode and tell it to go to school.

736
00:42:36,361 --> 00:42:37,078
Speaker 0: They just drove him there.

737
00:42:37,821 --> 00:42:41,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was all but most of the time George just is sitting into the stick and he's wiggling it back and forth.

738
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:44,550
Speaker 0: You know, he wasn't just playing like a game cuz he didn't see the guy.

739
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,032
Speaker 1: I don't know.

740
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:46,256
Speaker 0: It was in his brain.

741
00:42:46,819 --> 00:42:49,368
Speaker 0: maybe It's not like he was staring.

742
00:42:49,388 --> 00:42:53,994
Speaker 0: He's just going left right left right left friend Like everyone in old movies with that back projection is always Larry's.

743
00:42:54,015 --> 00:42:55,160
Speaker 1: the Jetsons had flying cars.

744
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:58,031
Speaker 1: They would still line up in traffic when they could just gone out.

745
00:42:58,071 --> 00:43:00,400
Speaker 1: There's different ways to directly to the destination.

746
00:43:02,001 --> 00:43:06,036
Speaker 0: There was even traffic in the fifth element, I know at least that made sense.

747
00:43:06,076 --> 00:43:07,180
Speaker 0: there were just so many cars.

748
00:43:07,766 --> 00:43:09,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, they actually cars fucking everywhere.

749
00:43:09,320 --> 00:43:09,601
Speaker 0: I'm just.

750
00:43:09,922 --> 00:43:11,648
Speaker 0: I'm really excited about robot cars.

751
00:43:11,708 --> 00:43:17,507
Speaker 0: if if there was anything that I want from science other than Immortality and perfect eternal.

752
00:43:17,607 --> 00:43:29,988
Speaker 1: I think robot cars are the most convenient awesome and drastic Improvement to everyday life that is feasible in the near either on the near future in the industrialized world because there are parts of the world Where clean water is a revolution.

753
00:43:30,008 --> 00:43:35,632
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean another related thing right is, you know I've always said I would get a tattoo if it was like digital like just a race.

754
00:43:35,812 --> 00:43:37,720
Speaker 0: Oh digital ink tattoo ink.

755
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,960
Speaker 1: There's strides in that as somebody invented basically like LED tattoo.

756
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:47,840
Speaker 1: So you implant this LED grid and then you can light it up in different colors and so I would get that.

757
00:43:48,161 --> 00:43:49,827
Speaker 1: I would get it under three conditions.

758
00:43:49,887 --> 00:43:53,580
Speaker 1: condition number one if I could turn off all the lights and it'd be invisible.

759
00:43:54,761 --> 00:43:57,252
Speaker 1: Condition number two, I could easily program it to do whatever.

760
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:57,875
Speaker 0: condition three.

761
00:43:57,895 --> 00:43:58,840
Speaker 0: It doesn't cause cancer.

762
00:43:59,322 --> 00:44:01,515
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I mean, it's just a grid or I have lights.

763
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,420
Speaker 1: It's not gonna be cancer.

764
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,920
Speaker 0: Never know my just you might get an infection now, you'd be surprised how much stuff leeches out of stuff.

765
00:44:07,081 --> 00:44:09,069
Speaker 0: Oh, that's true, especially in the human body.

766
00:44:09,109 --> 00:44:12,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if there's any pain or any sort of hazards I don't want it.

767
00:44:12,363 --> 00:44:15,555
Speaker 1: but condition three is what's the battery situation with that?

768
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:18,650
Speaker 1: Yeah got a battery in your ear Yeah, and you to replace the battery.

769
00:44:18,711 --> 00:44:19,496
Speaker 1: if that, you know, it's like.

770
00:44:19,516 --> 00:44:22,940
Speaker 0: fuck that, you know You charge it with induction maybe but be a way to do it.

771
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:27,118
Speaker 1: But if but if it has if it had all of the if did none of those caveats, I'll get it.

772
00:44:28,661 --> 00:44:32,908
Speaker 0: If you lottie know what you got to get is the thing where you can just wave your hand and your hand as the LEDs in it.

773
00:44:33,874 --> 00:44:35,542
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

774
00:44:35,862 --> 00:44:36,264
Speaker 0: All right.

775
00:44:36,705 --> 00:44:38,871
Speaker 0: So cuz Scott doesn't even have any tech news.

776
00:44:39,252 --> 00:44:43,050
Speaker 0: There's this dude and this is a common problem That's been around for a long time.

777
00:44:43,090 --> 00:44:44,179
Speaker 0: This is not a new story.

778
00:44:44,662 --> 00:44:47,639
Speaker 0: This guy is just a new story and that is calling attention to it.

779
00:44:48,161 --> 00:45:00,520
Speaker 0: Dude is smart has a smartphone goes to use book sales scans is BNS Automatically looks on Amazon to see if the books are worth money or not Buys all the books that are way underpriced sells them on Amazon.

780
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:03,130
Speaker 1: What I read is he's actually used bookstore owner, right?

781
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:05,640
Speaker 1: So he goes to you know, he doesn't go to used bookstores.

782
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:12,240
Speaker 1: He goes to like, you know second-hand stores and other places that books aren't their primary thing that they can tag sale.

783
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,389
Speaker 0: You're talking about Michael Savitt's the guy.

784
00:45:15,470 --> 00:45:16,252
Speaker 1: that's the guy.

785
00:45:16,312 --> 00:45:18,920
Speaker 0: there's a bunch more people involved in this this story.

786
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:27,673
Speaker 1: But I mean this one guy got most the internet attention cuz he goes around and he's trying to buy books to sell in his Used bookstore and he has like a database of the used books.

787
00:45:27,734 --> 00:45:28,920
Speaker 1: cuz he's used bookstore owner.

788
00:45:29,262 --> 00:45:37,534
Speaker 1: So he checks the value in his little database with his smartphone And if he sees that the book is underpriced he buys it and then sells it in his used bookstore.

789
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:39,520
Speaker 0: now, here's the problem.

790
00:45:40,501 --> 00:45:44,000
Speaker 0: First and weirdly I looked around on the internet and even slashdot.

791
00:45:45,121 --> 00:45:50,200
Speaker 0: I'd say the majority of the people posting are totally against this guy and are totally for the bookstores banning him.

792
00:45:50,402 --> 00:45:52,080
Speaker 0: What the fuck most of slash jobs?

793
00:45:53,381 --> 00:45:54,124
Speaker 0: Yes, last shot.

794
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:55,691
Speaker 0: People are like fuck this guy.

795
00:45:55,771 --> 00:45:56,394
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

796
00:45:56,434 --> 00:45:57,860
Speaker 0: He's being a jerk to the bookstore.

797
00:45:58,121 --> 00:45:59,770
Speaker 0: He's undercutting all the competition.

798
00:46:00,011 --> 00:46:03,609
Speaker 0: Like I can't imagine Called business isn't slash.

799
00:46:03,669 --> 00:46:04,774
Speaker 1: It's usually super live.

800
00:46:04,794 --> 00:46:05,960
Speaker 0: It's not even called business.

801
00:46:06,201 --> 00:46:09,693
Speaker 0: It's called being smart and using technology to do something better.

802
00:46:10,095 --> 00:46:11,600
Speaker 0: notice how the article says arbitrage.

803
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:17,376
Speaker 0: You know what arbitrage is if there is someone selling something and someone else buying something and their prices are crossed.

804
00:46:17,777 --> 00:46:22,138
Speaker 0: as in someone will buy Something for more than someone else is selling it and they just haven't met each other.

805
00:46:22,762 --> 00:46:26,180
Speaker 0: Arbitrage is when you buy it from person a and sell it to person B and pocket the difference.

806
00:46:26,522 --> 00:46:29,560
Speaker 0: Yep, and arbitrage is a very important thing in the stock market.

807
00:46:29,962 --> 00:46:34,910
Speaker 0: That's how you're able to trade even if no one's buying right now In in pretty much any time.

808
00:46:34,930 --> 00:46:35,775
Speaker 0: there's an imbalance.

809
00:46:35,815 --> 00:46:36,499
Speaker 0: in any market.

810
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:40,500
Speaker 0: Arbitrage is when someone takes it upon themselves to balance that out.

811
00:46:40,742 --> 00:46:46,453
Speaker 1: but what will happen right is right now we have a situation where there's a few smart people and a bunch of stupid people in every market.

812
00:46:46,774 --> 00:46:52,392
Speaker 1: if we have a ton of Arbitrage in all different markets then all prices converge on real price.

813
00:46:52,713 --> 00:46:59,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically the problem is that real price I think is gonna ruin our economy and make every all even more unemployment and porn.

814
00:46:59,321 --> 00:47:03,780
Speaker 0: Definitely what I think it's going to do is use bookstores will just disappear but they're gonna disappear.

815
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:06,279
Speaker 0: Anyway, Amazon wins Kindle wins.

816
00:47:06,661 --> 00:47:13,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, use bookstores only existed like the beach pretty much and even then most used bookstore owners don't use technology for shit.

817
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:23,328
Speaker 0: I never see barcodes or barcode scanners or even usually they've got that one like 486 that their grandkids set up for him 20 years ago, maybe Ten years ago.

818
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's the same in a lot of industries.

819
00:47:25,601 --> 00:47:31,408
Speaker 1: I was at this little hacker meetup and this guy he wasn't that technological He's mostly a business guy, right?

820
00:47:31,428 --> 00:47:33,660
Speaker 1: And apparently his family owns liquor stores, right?

821
00:47:34,180 --> 00:47:37,316
Speaker 1: So he knew how to program like a palm pilot and he programmed.

822
00:47:37,376 --> 00:47:38,180
Speaker 1: he went to business school.

823
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:47,160
Speaker 1: So he knew these business algorithms to figure out like how much inventory you should buy like what you should order You know and he knows he really knows how to figure out what you should order.

824
00:47:47,521 --> 00:47:53,100
Speaker 1: So he wrote a palm pilot program where you just keep the inventory and your sales on this palm pilot.

825
00:47:53,601 --> 00:48:00,320
Speaker 1: Not even a point-of-sale system doesn't even have that right because all his family's liquor stores are so technologically inept.

826
00:48:00,823 --> 00:48:06,854
Speaker 1: Even this shitty palm pilot app helps them like make better orders and not buy some alcohol.

827
00:48:06,874 --> 00:48:12,060
Speaker 1: that's gonna sit on the shelf and Order enough of what's gonna sell and have the price be correct, you know.

828
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:17,060
Speaker 1: And it's like imagine if they had a point-of-sale system and an actual computer instead of just this palm pilot thing.

829
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:17,611
Speaker 1: This guy wrote.

830
00:48:18,964 --> 00:48:22,580
Speaker 0: You could blow away all the liquor stores in town or even use bookstores.

831
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:25,300
Speaker 0: You know correlate like the guy at the beach right that used bookstore.

832
00:48:25,661 --> 00:48:32,627
Speaker 0: What if he just correlated like what sold and when it sold what authors were popular and you know The demographic of like a girl bought this.

833
00:48:32,708 --> 00:48:34,253
Speaker 1: a guy bought that right?

834
00:48:34,434 --> 00:48:36,220
Speaker 1: It's how many girls, you know general age.

835
00:48:36,441 --> 00:48:37,869
Speaker 1: You just look at the person right?

836
00:48:37,889 --> 00:48:40,227
Speaker 1: You could have cameras in your store perfectly legal You can.

837
00:48:40,248 --> 00:48:45,699
Speaker 1: just you know you could get all kinds of crazy data from that and use it to vastly improve your sales.

838
00:48:45,739 --> 00:48:49,800
Speaker 1: and then Like you could also if books aren't selling you can look on Amazon.

839
00:48:49,941 --> 00:48:54,259
Speaker 1: You can try to sell them on Amazon if no one's buying them in the store, you know do stuff like that.

840
00:48:54,874 --> 00:49:05,459
Speaker 0: Yeah The funny thing is I've run into this before I got kicked out of a Best Buy once when I was in high school Because I was shopping for something and I actually pulled out a camera and took a picture.

841
00:49:05,479 --> 00:49:07,460
Speaker 0: now You're not supposed to do that technically so I got kicked out.

842
00:49:07,500 --> 00:49:11,238
Speaker 0: But I got kicked out from another Best Buy when I did it with a pen and paper.

843
00:49:11,278 --> 00:49:17,400
Speaker 0: instead I was just writing down the prices of the things I was gonna buy and then going around other stores and seeing where it was Jeepist and they kick you out.

844
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,495
Speaker 0: I was writing down prices and they asked me to leave.

845
00:49:19,515 --> 00:49:24,594
Speaker 0: Wow And it's fairly common store and especially now that people have some like iPhones.

846
00:49:24,615 --> 00:49:26,079
Speaker 0: they're taking pictures or like.

847
00:49:26,099 --> 00:49:27,405
Speaker 1: well They're scanning the barcodes.

848
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:30,520
Speaker 0: Yes, take pictures of the barcodes and then looking on you know, there's apps.

849
00:49:30,540 --> 00:49:32,340
Speaker 0: They'll just tell you here's what this cost on Amazon.

850
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:39,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I've gotten a lot of no one can kick me out of like an anime dealers room But a lot of people have had harsh words for me.

851
00:49:39,670 --> 00:49:48,946
Speaker 0: when I stand at a guy's booth and I pick up like princess Tutu it's like 40 bucks and I just hold it in my hand and I hold my phone and I type in princess tutu And I see it's 30 bucks in Amazon.

852
00:49:48,966 --> 00:49:50,111
Speaker 0: I put it back down and walk away.

853
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:50,734
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

854
00:49:51,940 --> 00:49:52,762
Speaker 0: I Was just what.

855
00:49:52,923 --> 00:50:01,976
Speaker 1: as the guy gets that's that's the you know, I mean you can charge a slight premium for you know Sell it getting it now, right and you can get away with that.

856
00:50:02,036 --> 00:50:02,820
Speaker 1: For example, right?

857
00:50:02,900 --> 00:50:03,242
Speaker 1: I bought it.

858
00:50:03,282 --> 00:50:05,352
Speaker 1: I had to buy a new DS cuz the other one was stolen.

859
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:06,900
Speaker 1: I bought it in Best Buy.

860
00:50:07,000 --> 00:50:08,268
Speaker 1: I didn't show my receipt at the door.

861
00:50:08,409 --> 00:50:09,354
Speaker 1: I did the no thanks trick.

862
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:10,501
Speaker 0: Yeah, it worked Didn't?

863
00:50:10,521 --> 00:50:12,414
Speaker 0: they pause for a second like what and they just walk out?

864
00:50:12,495 --> 00:50:13,991
Speaker 1: I didn't even look at him I just walked out.

865
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:15,182
Speaker 0: You gotta say no Thanks, like.

866
00:50:15,202 --> 00:50:18,311
Speaker 0: you're totally sincere and they'll pause and just walk past him whatever.

867
00:50:18,712 --> 00:50:21,600
Speaker 1: so, you know, it's the same price in Amazon.

868
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:25,900
Speaker 1: Apparently wheeze and Xbox 360s are also the same price in Amazon as they are in the store.

869
00:50:26,141 --> 00:50:27,389
Speaker 0: So even my life camera.

870
00:50:27,430 --> 00:50:29,060
Speaker 0: I was gonna you know, I was gonna buy this webcam.

871
00:50:29,642 --> 00:50:31,972
Speaker 0: I go to Best Buy I see the price I go on Amazon.

872
00:50:32,012 --> 00:50:32,796
Speaker 0: I see it's the same.

873
00:50:32,816 --> 00:50:33,679
Speaker 0: So I just bought it.

874
00:50:33,881 --> 00:50:35,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's you know, it'll happen.

875
00:50:36,905 --> 00:50:40,860
Speaker 1: Most of the time Amazon is gonna be cheaper right and most of the time Best Buy is gonna over.

876
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,005
Speaker 1: But here's the final problem.

877
00:50:42,045 --> 00:50:42,888
Speaker 1: memory cards like.

878
00:50:42,908 --> 00:50:45,800
Speaker 1: I need a new memory card, you know a micro SD card.

879
00:50:45,880 --> 00:50:46,424
Speaker 1: so I go.

880
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:51,604
Speaker 1: and of course Best Buy is like 40 bucks and Amazon's like $10.

881
00:50:51,604 --> 00:50:59,820
Speaker 0: But here's the amazing thing Anyone I can see why store owners physical brick-and-mortar store owners are against people doing this.

882
00:51:00,081 --> 00:51:04,140
Speaker 0: That is self-interest and I can understand that if you don't own a store.

883
00:51:04,341 --> 00:51:12,855
Speaker 1: But I mean wouldn't it just be better if you were the owning the store if you just Competed and then one it's like, you know, because currently people don't do this by and large.

884
00:51:12,895 --> 00:51:14,300
Speaker 0: so they win by not competing.

885
00:51:14,806 --> 00:51:15,859
Speaker 0: I mean think about how many people buy an.

886
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:23,280
Speaker 1: They make more money ripping off all those customers and just getting rid of a few smart customers and not getting their business at all.

887
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,751
Speaker 0: Oh source hate smart customers.

888
00:51:24,771 --> 00:51:25,920
Speaker 0: They'd rather us just not shop there.

889
00:51:26,141 --> 00:51:37,920
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, kind of like how TV networks will often, you know, if the demographic if a show is popular But not with the right advertising demographic They'll just take it Even if the show is very popular because they don't make money from the popularity of the show.

890
00:51:38,201 --> 00:51:41,149
Speaker 0: They make money from the advertisers and the advertisers want the.

891
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:44,700
Speaker 0: you know, the dream demographic 20 to 30 something affluent white dudes.

892
00:51:45,064 --> 00:51:47,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I mean or you know It depends to like if you're.

893
00:51:48,207 --> 00:51:56,455
Speaker 1: if you're advertising like prescription drug plans you advertise people CBS during the daytime when the old people are watching, you know It's like they.

894
00:51:56,475 --> 00:51:56,556
Speaker 1: it's.

895
00:51:56,657 --> 00:52:08,982
Speaker 1: you know If a show doesn't have a particular demographic then even if the even if the audience is very large if you're not advertising something that has a broad audience that's just generic pop culture then It's cute.

896
00:52:09,002 --> 00:52:13,040
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get that many, you know eyeballs that you want cuz like, okay, I'm gonna advertise.

897
00:52:14,246 --> 00:52:19,313
Speaker 1: You know Some like toys and I'm gonna advertise the toys on HBO.

898
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,460
Speaker 1: HBO doesn't have commercials, but you get the point, right?

899
00:52:21,480 --> 00:52:26,459
Speaker 1: It's like no kids are watching that dude Even if a billion people are watching it.

900
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,809
Speaker 1: Advertising he-man is not gonna work in that spot.

901
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:32,337
Speaker 0: There was a time when cable didn't have commercials.

902
00:52:32,598 --> 00:52:33,080
Speaker 1: That's true.

903
00:52:33,482 --> 00:52:36,278
Speaker 1: So, I mean, you know, it's it might want to show that.

904
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:43,732
Speaker 1: okay We want a show where even if only a million people are watching even if only a few thousand people are watching They're all in the same demographic or mostly.

905
00:52:44,053 --> 00:52:45,580
Speaker 1: so our advertising be very effective.

906
00:52:45,921 --> 00:52:50,637
Speaker 0: So my point is thus I can understand why store owners are against this sort of thing.

907
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:53,026
Speaker 0: Fuck them But I understand where they're coming from.

908
00:52:53,568 --> 00:52:54,773
Speaker 0: anyone who's not own a store.

909
00:52:54,793 --> 00:52:55,857
Speaker 0: I can.

910
00:52:55,957 --> 00:53:07,243
Speaker 0: there is no possible rational argument you can make against someone using extent information that is publicly available on their smartphone to figure out if a deal in a store is a good Deal or not.

911
00:53:07,424 --> 00:53:07,767
Speaker 0: I don't know.

912
00:53:07,787 --> 00:53:08,371
Speaker 1: there it's.

913
00:53:08,653 --> 00:53:10,643
Speaker 1: it's weird the attitudes I see people have.

914
00:53:10,683 --> 00:53:16,006
Speaker 1: I've seen different attitudes such as there are people who feel charitable towards the store owners Like especially.

915
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,740
Speaker 1: I see this a lot with comic people, right?

916
00:53:17,841 --> 00:53:18,122
Speaker 1: It's like.

917
00:53:18,564 --> 00:53:19,268
Speaker 1: I'm like, why do you?

918
00:53:19,549 --> 00:53:21,600
Speaker 1: why don't you just pre-order and get the crazy discount?

919
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:23,572
Speaker 1: They're like, oh because I'm supporting the store.

920
00:53:23,592 --> 00:53:27,299
Speaker 1: It's like Just listen to the not a charity episode.

921
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,353
Speaker 0: Here's a quote from one of the one of the haters on slash dot.

922
00:53:30,614 --> 00:53:34,688
Speaker 0: and now that I'm looking at the article again Luckily all the haters have for every hater.

923
00:53:34,788 --> 00:53:36,894
Speaker 0: There's two responders saying what the fuck's wrong with you.

924
00:53:36,974 --> 00:53:42,021
Speaker 0: So slash dot dot respect plus plus Quote.

925
00:53:42,323 --> 00:53:45,016
Speaker 0: sure you can go through all those second-hand bookstores and strip them of anything.

926
00:53:45,036 --> 00:53:45,760
Speaker 0: They'll make a profit.

927
00:53:46,041 --> 00:53:49,620
Speaker 0: It makes the store less interesting for the rest of us who actually want to read the books we find.

928
00:53:50,124 --> 00:53:56,360
Speaker 0: I like the search which may turn up treasure I recognize or may turn up something obscure that I but virtually nobody else wants to read.

929
00:53:57,502 --> 00:53:58,486
Speaker 1: You can just do that on the internet.

930
00:53:58,546 --> 00:53:59,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck you.

931
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:02,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I Think a lot of it is.

932
00:54:02,684 --> 00:54:02,965
Speaker 1: it's.

933
00:54:03,065 --> 00:54:04,851
Speaker 1: it's like feelings and nostalgia.

934
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:09,159
Speaker 1: Like people say oh, I like to hold it in my hands It's like that's a legitimate thing.

935
00:54:09,501 --> 00:54:19,360
Speaker 0: But to then say therefore you smart person should use your smartphone to find a smart price Because then this if you TV take it to the logical extreme the store won't exist anymore.

936
00:54:19,462 --> 00:54:20,640
Speaker 1: They won't be able to go there anymore.

937
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:23,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the store only exists because there's so many stupid people.

938
00:54:23,489 --> 00:54:24,573
Speaker 0: It's the nostalgia.

939
00:54:24,593 --> 00:54:27,847
Speaker 0: People are not the majority of the market either They're the minority.

940
00:54:27,907 --> 00:54:28,611
Speaker 0: We're the minority.

941
00:54:28,651 --> 00:54:30,039
Speaker 0: the majority just doesn't know better.

942
00:54:30,401 --> 00:54:35,667
Speaker 0: When I every time I'm in a Best Buy or a surgical circuit city or a store like that I guess not Circuit City anymore.

943
00:54:35,727 --> 00:54:37,114
Speaker 1: That was a long time ago.

944
00:54:37,194 --> 00:54:37,978
Speaker 1: I forgot they existed.

945
00:54:38,018 --> 00:54:40,026
Speaker 0: remember Well, I guess FYE is still around.

946
00:54:40,066 --> 00:54:42,614
Speaker 1: media play media play was the best.

947
00:54:43,176 --> 00:54:47,616
Speaker 1: media play was the best one Because that's the real media play cuz actually competed with the internet.

948
00:54:47,636 --> 00:54:48,420
Speaker 1: That's why they're out of business.

949
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:52,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, media play was the store that sold what the internet now sells.

950
00:54:52,301 --> 00:55:01,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, media play was great when I couldn't buy stuff on the internet and sure was Plus that one media play in Rochester is one of the only Profitable ones toward the end as far as I could tell and it actually sir.

951
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:02,779
Speaker 1: I bought my GameCube.

952
00:55:02,819 --> 00:55:03,764
Speaker 1: there They serve nerds.

953
00:55:03,824 --> 00:55:08,085
Speaker 1: Well, they're like, this is our IT could pre-order stuff easily You know you would.

954
00:55:08,105 --> 00:55:11,297
Speaker 1: I'll bet that that you would actually get the stuff you pre-ordered.

955
00:55:11,357 --> 00:55:13,226
Speaker 1: if you pre-ordered something You have like a pre-order bonus.

956
00:55:13,246 --> 00:55:14,131
Speaker 1: You'd get the bonus.

957
00:55:14,433 --> 00:55:15,740
Speaker 1: I had D&D books.

958
00:55:15,840 --> 00:55:23,389
Speaker 0: They had I will bet money that that media play if media play had gone under and somehow that media play had been exempt from The bankruptcy could have stuck around.

959
00:55:23,751 --> 00:55:25,940
Speaker 0: maybe they would had to get rid of all those CDs.

960
00:55:26,081 --> 00:55:29,927
Speaker 1: They had a huge music section and a whole bunch of other crap They were mandated to have.

961
00:55:29,967 --> 00:55:31,012
Speaker 0: that cuz that never sold that.

962
00:55:31,033 --> 00:55:34,368
Speaker 0: the manager herself said that yeah This anime shit is like half our money.

963
00:55:34,388 --> 00:55:35,833
Speaker 1: Yeah, they sell anime shit.

964
00:55:35,854 --> 00:55:37,420
Speaker 1: They had you know, some nerdy books.

965
00:55:38,184 --> 00:55:39,251
Speaker 1: You know that kind of thing whatever.

966
00:55:39,915 --> 00:55:48,360
Speaker 0: but anyway I I don't know what to do about this because stores are literally like yelling at people and like making people leave or just scan.

967
00:55:48,460 --> 00:55:51,905
Speaker 1: If anyone yells at me, I'll just leave I'll be like fine no money for you I'll never come back here.

968
00:55:52,147 --> 00:55:54,000
Speaker 1: And in fact, I'm telling everyone else never come back.

969
00:55:54,042 --> 00:56:03,239
Speaker 0: Yeah At least I do a public service whenever I'm in a Best Buy and I I love the look on Best Buy employees faces cuz they Work there, but they don't own Best Buy's They don't really care.

970
00:56:03,602 --> 00:56:15,980
Speaker 0: But they're still annoyed a little bit when you know I'm standing looking at something and a guy's like Asking him a question and I just kind of look at Amazon to see what it really cost and I turn and say yeah You can buy that exact same thing on Amazon for like 40 bucks less and then just walk away.

971
00:56:16,382 --> 00:56:17,506
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love doing that.

972
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:20,619
Speaker 0: one Best Guy guy was like, yeah, but you won't get the extended warranty.

973
00:56:24,260 --> 00:56:27,840
Speaker 1: Actually if you buy it with the American Express card you will get an extra warranty on time.

974
00:56:28,881 --> 00:56:31,520
Speaker 0: If everyone knew that that benefit would go away.

975
00:56:31,681 --> 00:56:33,749
Speaker 0: I think it's only there because most people don't know all those.

976
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:37,324
Speaker 1: the reason all those part of the reason all those benefits exist is No one knows about them.

977
00:56:37,464 --> 00:56:37,705
Speaker 0: Yeah.

978
00:56:38,107 --> 00:56:38,388
Speaker 0: Yeah.

979
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:41,580
Speaker 0: So do you have anything cuz I got one more thing I want to talk about.

980
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:44,380
Speaker 1: Alright, let's just get it over with cuz I'm way hungry and I'm gonna make some awesome dinner.

981
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:47,614
Speaker 0: Alright, there's a slash shot article on like the 12th.

982
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:51,322
Speaker 1: So like last week on a Tuesday We haven't done tech stuff in a long time So that's plenty.

983
00:56:51,402 --> 00:56:56,520
Speaker 0: and it basically said that people are stupid with their passwords online and it made all these kind of disparaging remarks.

984
00:56:56,640 --> 00:57:00,352
Speaker 0: But yeah, the stupid users like they use passwords incorrectly and I read the.

985
00:57:00,433 --> 00:57:02,700
Speaker 1: I think the biggest problem is simply that it's it.

986
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:05,292
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with the people passwords people make.

987
00:57:05,432 --> 00:57:07,060
Speaker 1: I mean except for the people who make a password.

988
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,010
Speaker 1: That's like password or admin or ABC 123.

989
00:57:10,010 --> 00:57:11,154
Speaker 0: You don't need a password.

990
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,800
Speaker 0: That's 16 like high ASCII.

991
00:57:13,661 --> 00:57:19,200
Speaker 1: It helps to have something that's a little bit complicated likes and something that's something that no one you know can figure out.

992
00:57:19,240 --> 00:57:28,220
Speaker 1: Right, a lot of people will make something like the name of their dog, but now it's like, okay great That's you know, no one's gonna figure it out some stranger, but everyone you know can figure it out.

993
00:57:28,662 --> 00:57:33,840
Speaker 1: So you wonder you know most of the time when you hacks, you know Some people talk about oh you hacked my myspace.

994
00:57:34,262 --> 00:57:37,600
Speaker 1: It's cuz he figured out your password cuz he knows you personally, you know?

995
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,616
Speaker 1: Or they look at your profile and they figure out your password from your profile

996
00:57:40,676 --> 00:57:41,641
Speaker 0: or keylogger But

997
00:57:41,803 --> 00:57:51,380
Speaker 1: or keyloggers, you know, but that's that's much more rare As long as your password isn't something personally that someone can figure out about you if they know you and it's not something completely stupid.

998
00:57:52,082 --> 00:57:55,370
Speaker 1: The biggest problem is people tell people their passwords.

999
00:57:55,911 --> 00:57:59,340
Speaker 1: Don't tell anybody don't tell your your wife don't tell nobody.

1000
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,947
Speaker 0: I don't think that's the biggest problem anymore.

1001
00:58:01,007 --> 00:58:02,132
Speaker 0: That is a huge problem.

1002
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:09,540
Speaker 0: But reading this article I realized that one Everyone recommends like have a huge hard-to-remember password that's unique to every site you visit.

1003
00:58:09,681 --> 00:58:13,080
Speaker 0: No have like two throwaway passwords for all the throwaway bullshit sites.

1004
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:21,520
Speaker 0: The only things that actually need a password that is actually difficult are your bank Yeah, and any financial stuff like you have Scott trade account or something?

1005
00:58:21,941 --> 00:58:30,180
Speaker 0: But more important than that your goddamn email address because if you Compromise someone's email address you can compromise every other account they've got in the world.

1006
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:36,955
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz all you have to do is search through their email figure out the username go reset the password Get the new password from their email.

1007
00:58:37,116 --> 00:58:44,280
Speaker 1: They're fucked Yeah, but the thing is if let's say someone compromises your Facebook if you still have your email you can recover your face.

1008
00:58:44,360 --> 00:58:48,000
Speaker 0: But yeah, but if you if someone compromises your email you are so fucked.

1009
00:58:48,361 --> 00:58:51,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, mail is probably the most if you have to rank all your passwords.

1010
00:58:51,971 --> 00:58:55,000
Speaker 0: I think email is actually number one in this world today.

1011
00:58:55,161 --> 00:58:58,440
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, unless you are a lot of you doesn't do anything important on the internet.

1012
00:58:58,480 --> 00:59:03,660
Speaker 1: See I've been using super gen pass and the way super gen pass works is one of those domain hash salt thingies.

1013
00:59:04,041 --> 00:59:08,520
Speaker 1: So what basically the way it works is you have one password that you remember and make it a good one, right?

1014
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:11,540
Speaker 1: Because if but what happens is you go to a website.

1015
00:59:11,620 --> 00:59:13,868
Speaker 1: Let's say I go to a website for American Express.

1016
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:21,540
Speaker 1: it basically takes the American Express comm domain Combines it with my master password and generates a new password.

1017
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:25,080
Speaker 1: That's crazy complicated and it uses that as the password for the site.

1018
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:35,789
Speaker 1: So what I do is I just type in the one password that I remember and then I go to any website and I click the super gen pass thing and Automatically spits out the password for that site.

1019
00:59:35,830 --> 00:59:37,917
Speaker 1: So I have a different password for every frickin website.

1020
00:59:37,957 --> 00:59:38,820
Speaker 1: That's crazy complicated.

1021
00:59:38,840 --> 00:59:42,274
Speaker 1: I don't even know what most of them are, but I don't have to remember all of them.

1022
00:59:42,696 --> 00:59:43,680
Speaker 1: and super gen pass.

1023
00:59:43,902 --> 00:59:49,980
Speaker 1: You know, you normally would be like whoa What a super gen pass disappears, but super gen pass is a little bit of JavaScript and I've got it saved.

1024
00:59:50,261 --> 00:59:51,968
Speaker 1: So I have it forever in case anything happens.

1025
00:59:52,249 --> 00:59:54,017
Speaker 1: and they have a mobile site and they've got it all.

1026
00:59:54,117 --> 00:59:55,222
Speaker 1: it's all set up It's all good.

1027
00:59:55,423 --> 00:59:56,828
Speaker 0: Now a poor way to go.

1028
00:59:57,109 --> 00:59:57,551
Speaker 0: It's not.

1029
00:59:57,711 --> 00:59:58,956
Speaker 1: it's not the best solution.

1030
00:59:58,976 --> 01:00:03,519
Speaker 1: There's new a better solution I'm gonna switch to and the better solution is a password card.

1031
01:00:03,961 --> 01:00:14,656
Speaker 1: This is a website you go to and you print out a password card and it generates one randomly and it's basically just this grid Of random symbols and each row and column has a symbol on it identifying it.

1032
01:00:14,736 --> 01:00:20,560
Speaker 1: so you could just be like, alright I'll remember that the first eight symbols in the dollar sign column are my bank.

1033
01:00:21,043 --> 01:00:23,280
Speaker 1: So you look and there's a password right there for you.

1034
01:00:23,340 --> 01:00:28,939
Speaker 1: But if you lose the card someone looks at and they go Uh, it's just a card with a bunch of crazy symbols on it doesn't help them at all.

1035
01:00:29,181 --> 01:00:38,040
Speaker 0: And even you know brute-forcing is not an issue anymore because every site that's worth anything After you try three or four times it slows you down or locks you out or something.

1036
01:00:38,262 --> 01:00:39,940
Speaker 1: Well, I mean a brute-forcing from that angle.

1037
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:48,540
Speaker 1: But even then if your passwords are hashed and salted in the database as someone who has access to the database So if it's an inside job, it's still gonna be really hard for them to get your password.

1038
01:00:49,242 --> 01:00:57,727
Speaker 0: Uh, unless it's a shady like, you know crappy for a lot of places do not salt and hash the password properly Even if you do nothing else.

1039
01:00:57,907 --> 01:01:03,943
Speaker 0: if you just use like the lowest goddamn level Apache like HT access and HT password You're fine.

1040
01:01:03,963 --> 01:01:05,287
Speaker 1: Well, mostly fine.

1041
01:01:05,367 --> 01:01:06,370
Speaker 0: Well, you're fine enough.

1042
01:01:06,792 --> 01:01:08,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly not completely.

1043
01:01:08,697 --> 01:01:12,240
Speaker 1: you're fine for morons But still they're hacker people who just be like they'll break that so fast.

1044
01:01:12,421 --> 01:01:13,685
Speaker 0: They have to break in.

1045
01:01:13,786 --> 01:01:16,836
Speaker 0: usually they have to at least break Apache right but it's easy to do that.

1046
01:01:16,857 --> 01:01:19,245
Speaker 1: if someone's who someone Who's not doing stuff properly?

1047
01:01:19,325 --> 01:01:20,229
Speaker 1: It's already they're all.

1048
01:01:20,249 --> 01:01:21,975
Speaker 1: their whole thing is gonna be easy to destroy.

1049
01:01:21,995 --> 01:01:25,148
Speaker 1: true true Yeah, they're gonna have holes all over.

1050
01:01:25,188 --> 01:01:25,972
Speaker 0: actually what I want.

1051
01:01:25,992 --> 01:01:27,599
Speaker 1: You're either Swiss cheese or your Fort.

1052
01:01:27,619 --> 01:01:28,966
Speaker 1: not There isn't a lot of in between.

1053
01:01:28,987 --> 01:01:35,160
Speaker 0: I have my Yuba key and I have an open ID And I use that for every site that takes it which currently is fucking nothing.

1054
01:01:35,381 --> 01:01:36,891
Speaker 1: I'll actually a lot of sites use open ID.

1055
01:01:36,911 --> 01:01:43,226
Speaker 0: They're just not sites that you use Yeah, but nothing that I use except uh, well nothing now Yeah, no, but you know.

1056
01:01:43,387 --> 01:01:46,539
Speaker 1: if thing about Yuba key and other, you know, is that?

1057
01:01:47,761 --> 01:01:55,723
Speaker 1: If you're making sites for yourself your internal stuff at a company or like our own geek night stuff You can make it use The UV.

1058
01:01:55,743 --> 01:01:57,272
Speaker 0: well open ID is interesting because it's not.

1059
01:01:57,292 --> 01:01:58,700
Speaker 1: you have your own WordPress blog.

1060
01:01:58,820 --> 01:02:02,492
Speaker 1: You can install the Yuba key plug-in open IDs or something like open ID.

1061
01:02:02,532 --> 01:02:04,860
Speaker 0: not to plug open ID because it does have its problems.

1062
01:02:05,241 --> 01:02:07,108
Speaker 0: Not to say that I promise is open idea.

1063
01:02:07,309 --> 01:02:08,353
Speaker 0: Nothing fucking uses it.

1064
01:02:08,915 --> 01:02:12,072
Speaker 1: every the lot of stuff uses it Not enough stuff stack overflow.

1065
01:02:12,092 --> 01:02:13,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I use it for that.

1066
01:02:13,721 --> 01:02:17,440
Speaker 1: I think the thing is that most sites right are actually open ID providers.

1067
01:02:18,002 --> 01:02:26,231
Speaker 1: So like you get you know, Google your Google account is an open ID and your Facebook account is an open ID But you can't use your open ID from Google to log into Facebook.

1068
01:02:26,391 --> 01:02:27,837
Speaker 0: Yep, and I want a universal one.

1069
01:02:27,857 --> 01:02:30,246
Speaker 1: They're not consumers They're just they're their providers.

1070
01:02:30,607 --> 01:02:34,163
Speaker 0: Also, like maybe a different company could do it better or different open version or whatever There's.

1071
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:37,946
Speaker 0: there's different ways to go about it But with something like open ID.

1072
01:02:37,966 --> 01:02:43,220
Speaker 0: the primary benefit of it at least in my opinion is proof of identity more so than authentication.

1073
01:02:43,441 --> 01:02:52,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the ability to say look I made this post and I am me Yeah, or I am X this and I was you know, oh I can prove later that that was me.

1074
01:02:52,260 --> 01:02:54,308
Speaker 1: Well, oh off is helping with that a bit.

1075
01:02:54,388 --> 01:02:56,436
Speaker 1: But oh off is not the same thing as open ID.

1076
01:02:56,456 --> 01:02:57,540
Speaker 1: people get them confused a lot.

1077
01:02:57,540 --> 01:02:58,640
Speaker 1: They're actually completely separate.

1078
01:02:59,141 --> 01:03:06,382
Speaker 1: What Oh off is is is when I go to say your website and your website is some integration with Facebook Right.

1079
01:03:06,402 --> 01:03:11,460
Speaker 1: I mean I could use you know, Oh open ID to log into your website with Facebook.

1080
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:18,760
Speaker 1: But Oh off is basically I give you permission on Facebook to do stuff with my Facebook account, right?

1081
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,567
Speaker 1: It's it's the other direction, right?

1082
01:03:20,888 --> 01:03:24,744
Speaker 1: So if I want to log into rims website with Facebook That's open ID.

1083
01:03:25,025 --> 01:03:30,047
Speaker 1: if I want to give rim the ability to do stuff to my Facebook Then that's Oh off right?

1084
01:03:30,248 --> 01:03:32,356
Speaker 1: There's two things going on there and people.

1085
01:03:32,477 --> 01:03:34,384
Speaker 1: people are not, you know Always up on that.

1086
01:03:34,505 --> 01:03:38,160
Speaker 0: so something Google's been doing lately my last thing and Facebook is doing it now, too.

1087
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,148
Speaker 0: But Facebook introduced their one-time passwords.

1088
01:03:40,650 --> 01:03:41,915
Speaker 0: if you set it up get this?

1089
01:03:42,096 --> 01:03:43,000
Speaker 0: you text some number.

1090
01:03:43,462 --> 01:03:46,755
Speaker 0: It texts you back a temporary password that you can log in in the next 20 minutes.

1091
01:03:47,358 --> 01:03:57,360
Speaker 0: All right, and That's a great part of the problem is great part of the problem of email You know being the point of attack for everyone is that you can reset all the passwords to email.

1092
01:03:57,843 --> 01:04:02,166
Speaker 0: It's a hell of a lot harder to hack someone's phone Straight up.

1093
01:04:02,206 --> 01:04:03,840
Speaker 1: It's really easy to send someone's text.

1094
01:04:03,941 --> 01:04:06,600
Speaker 1: It's really hard to intercept someone's text unless you take their phone.

1095
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:08,813
Speaker 1: Which do you do have to worry about?

1096
01:04:08,854 --> 01:04:09,860
Speaker 1: people are very close to you.

1097
01:04:09,940 --> 01:04:17,086
Speaker 1: A lot of people are very free about like letting their family members mess with their phone and sharing, you know This is something people really need to do.

1098
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:21,080
Speaker 1: and you know, I mean a lot of people have you know, trustworthy families.

1099
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:26,390
Speaker 0: It's a lot of shared passwords in situations where there's no better solution But everyone should have their own.

1100
01:04:26,450 --> 01:04:38,960
Speaker 1: the thing is a lot of people Have you know, they get fucked by the people that are closest to them, you know There's plenty of people have like shitty parents or you know shitty, you know spouses or shitty siblings.

1101
01:04:39,201 --> 01:04:39,963
Speaker 0: Not just text out.

1102
01:04:39,983 --> 01:04:41,267
Speaker 1: don't share your shit.

1103
01:04:41,287 --> 01:04:48,070
Speaker 1: Don't let anyone even touch your phone, you know, even if it's like, you know You're your person you've been married to for 50 years.

1104
01:04:48,131 --> 01:04:49,296
Speaker 1: Do not let them touch your phone.

1105
01:04:49,336 --> 01:04:52,620
Speaker 1: get your own damn phone Right because who knows what the fuck right?

1106
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:57,440
Speaker 1: You can't even if it's it could be incompetence that fucks you over, you know, well, I would argue more generally.

1107
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,758
Speaker 0: I mean, I let people use my phone sometimes because there's not much on my phone.

1108
01:05:00,798 --> 01:05:07,121
Speaker 1: You could do No, but I mean like, you know, somebody could get a one-time password with my text messaging, you know It's.

1109
01:05:07,141 --> 01:05:08,066
Speaker 1: that's pretty serious.

1110
01:05:08,106 --> 01:05:10,679
Speaker 0: if you have my phone, you know, but at the same time my bank.

1111
01:05:11,987 --> 01:05:12,852
Speaker 0: I can see if they did that.

1112
01:05:13,073 --> 01:05:14,320
Speaker 0: I wouldn't let my phone to a stranger.

1113
01:05:14,460 --> 01:05:20,280
Speaker 1: No, my bank tells me to verify like you could do it by email or by text or by telephone audio call.

1114
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:26,484
Speaker 1: So it's like you got two out of the three ways to get to my bank account if you got my phone, you know, so Well the real thing.

1115
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:27,529
Speaker 0: look at society in general.

1116
01:05:27,569 --> 01:05:28,412
Speaker 0: forget all the tech stuff.

1117
01:05:28,753 --> 01:05:35,440
Speaker 0: most murders and most Violence and most robberies and most kidnappings and most sexual assault are close friends and family.

1118
01:05:35,620 --> 01:05:39,775
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like crazy random psycho on the street or like dedicated robber.

1119
01:05:39,795 --> 01:05:40,979
Speaker 0: are the rarity.

1120
01:05:41,460 --> 01:05:46,393
Speaker 0: Notwithstanding the anecdotal evidence the scotches got robbed by a stranger by not my family.

1121
01:05:46,975 --> 01:05:48,679
Speaker 1: I could have been someone I know was it you?

1122
01:05:48,940 --> 01:05:49,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was me.

1123
01:05:50,284 --> 01:05:50,826
Speaker 1: Where's my TV?

1124
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:55,020
Speaker 1: Why do you think I have two Xboxes, you know, I should just steal your Xbox.

1125
01:05:55,181 --> 01:05:56,454
Speaker 1: I wouldn't have to buy a new one.

1126
01:05:56,494 --> 01:05:57,080
Speaker 1: You have more money.

1127
01:05:57,984 --> 01:05:58,933
Speaker 1: You go buy a new Xbox.

1128
01:05:58,953 --> 01:05:59,599
Speaker 1: I'll just take yours.
