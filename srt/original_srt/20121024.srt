1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,547
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, October 24th, 2012.

2
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:13,877
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:14,364 --> 00:00:14,857
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,460
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight, the sixth One Piece movie.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:20,878
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:27,260
Speaker 0: So we were going to watch the first One Piece movie, and I downloaded it.

7
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:31,240
Speaker 0: In fact, I downloaded a torrent that was every One Piece movie, up to like nine.

8
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:31,809
Speaker 0: Whoa.

9
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:34,840
Speaker 0: With Arabic and Italian subtitles only.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,300
Speaker 1: Well, we know it's very popular in Italy.

11
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,479
Speaker 1: They have that great One Piece opener.

12
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:37,873
Speaker 1: Yeah.

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:44,760
Speaker 0: The thing is, the opener that stuck in my head is the American opener, because of that panel I always wrote.

14
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,439
Speaker 0: Did you- One Piece.

15
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,220
Speaker 0: It's the name of the treasure on the grand line.

16
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,278
Speaker 1: Did you not look at the notes on the torrent and see that- Yeah, so you know what?

17
00:00:54,561 --> 00:00:56,660
Speaker 0: Most of these torrents had fuck all for notes.

18
00:00:56,822 --> 00:00:57,500
Speaker 1: Were you on Pirate Bay?

19
00:00:57,946 --> 00:00:58,179
Speaker 0: Yeah.

20
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:03,000
Speaker 1: Maybe you should go see for anime, sometimes you gotta go to the other site with like Baka BT or whatever.

21
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:03,838
Speaker 1: I don't even know what it is.

22
00:01:04,181 --> 00:01:08,216
Speaker 0: I looked around and most of them had all the recent One Piece movies, but not the first one.

23
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,139
Speaker 0: So I had another torrent, so I figured, you know, one of the two would be good.

24
00:01:11,867 --> 00:01:12,037
Speaker 0: Nope.

25
00:01:12,641 --> 00:01:13,799
Speaker 0: Also, only Italian.

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,839
Speaker 1: I have a feeling you didn't read something.

27
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:21,270
Speaker 1: Usually I notice it says on torrents, like, "This has Italian Dutch subtitles, this is Italian

28
00:01:21,290 --> 00:01:21,680
Speaker 1: subtitles.".

29
00:01:21,781 --> 00:01:25,370
Speaker 0: One of them had comments that were only in Italian, and I kind of thought, "Well, this one might not be

30
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:25,533
Speaker 0: good.".

31
00:01:26,008 --> 00:01:26,080
Speaker 0: Gee.

32
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,436
Speaker 1: But that was my back- I wonder.

33
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,659
Speaker 0: That one was my backup torrent.

34
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:30,488
Speaker 1: Right.

35
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:32,797
Speaker 0: So this morning I'm like,

36
00:01:32,837 --> 00:01:33,079
Speaker 0: "Fuck.".

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,540
Speaker 0: So I'd search for like every torrent, I'd start them all, because whatever, I got Fios.

38
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,280
Speaker 0: And not only was not a single torrent in English, but one of them was in Hebrew.

39
00:01:42,904 --> 00:01:43,078
Speaker 1: Okay.

40
00:01:44,341 --> 00:01:49,178
Speaker 0: So all the other One Piece movies are really easy to get, so we watched the sixth One Piece movie.

41
00:01:49,848 --> 00:01:50,117
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

42
00:01:50,461 --> 00:01:53,380
Speaker 0: We'll get to that in a little bit, but first we got some news, because it's Wednesday.

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,460
Speaker 1: All right, so check this out.

44
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:54,980
Speaker 0: I'm checking.

45
00:01:56,322 --> 00:01:59,000
Speaker 1: You know, Katie Cook wrote this pony comic.

46
00:01:59,485 --> 00:02:00,880
Speaker 1: I forgot, who's the guy who drew it?

47
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:01,540
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

48
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:02,379
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

49
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,187
Speaker 1: And everyone keeps getting it confused.

50
00:02:04,267 --> 00:02:09,639
Speaker 1: anyway, sorry artist dude, because Katie Cook has been known as an artist, right?

51
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,140
Speaker 1: You know, of many things.

52
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,399
Speaker 1: And she's very, very good.

53
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:19,839
Speaker 1: So when she suddenly writes a comic, everyone's like thinking she's drawing it without even, you know, noticing.

54
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,457
Speaker 1: But anyway, the pony comic.

55
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,780
Speaker 1: The pre-sales for it, I guess.

56
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,517
Speaker 0: Of course, we're talking about My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic, you know, G4.

57
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:29,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, issue number one from IDW, right?

58
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:34,300
Speaker 1: The sales were over 90,000.

59
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,260
Speaker 1: So wait, wait, wait, wait.

60
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,800
Speaker 1: And you might be saying 90,000 copies.

61
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:47,620
Speaker 0: So correct me if I'm wrong, but is not My Little Pony now, the new comic, before it's even available for real, outselling X-Men?

62
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's kind of weird, right?

63
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,720
Speaker 1: Back in the olden days, the number one selling comic book would be millions of copies, like action comics, you know, in the olden days, golden age.

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,420
Speaker 0: You know, before everything we talk about on Geek Nights.

65
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:11,078
Speaker 1: Nowadays, if you sell 100,000 copies, you are pretty much the most popular comic there is because the only nerds buy those little, you know, buy floppy comic books in comic book stores and no one else.

66
00:03:11,582 --> 00:03:16,420
Speaker 1: And the number that they quote you is the number that comic book stores buy, not the number that comic book stores sell.

67
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,919
Speaker 1: So a lot of times, you know, the best selling comic doesn't actually sell as well as you think it does.

68
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:25,320
Speaker 1: Because comic book stores load up on it and then no one buys.

69
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:28,640
Speaker 0: Or if they don't, maybe every comic book store only buys one.

70
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,958
Speaker 0: That's still a lot of comics.

71
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,400
Speaker 1: Well, no, that's that's a few thousand.

72
00:03:33,841 --> 00:03:35,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's more than a few thousand comic book stores.

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,080
Speaker 1: There's so few comic book stores, you have no idea.

74
00:03:38,281 --> 00:03:39,080
Speaker 1: It's like a couple thousand.

75
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:39,760
Speaker 0: Maybe three.

76
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,600
Speaker 0: Well, I'll try to find out how many comic book stores there are in America.

77
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,099
Speaker 1: It is only a few thousand, it is kind of sad.

78
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:47,799
Speaker 1: It's a really sad number when you find it anyway.

79
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,039
Speaker 0: But yet somehow there's that one in Newberg.

80
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:53,220
Speaker 1: If that one even counts anyway.

81
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,540
Speaker 0: There's the one in the hippie mall.

82
00:03:55,160 --> 00:04:02,720
Speaker 1: So the thing is, you know, something that, you know, they love to do with comics to make more money is they make multiple covers.

83
00:04:03,342 --> 00:04:05,252
Speaker 1: And the My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic.

84
00:04:05,332 --> 00:04:06,740
Speaker 1: issue number one is no exception.

85
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,560
Speaker 1: There's a there's a like two or three covers to choose from.

86
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:15,319
Speaker 1: And then there's like limited variant covers and then there's like a box set that has all the covers.

87
00:04:15,542 --> 00:04:17,779
Speaker 1: And then there's an even more limited cover and it's crazy.

88
00:04:19,983 --> 00:04:32,080
Speaker 1: Uh, so I actually did something I never do and bought all the covers, one of everything because I'll read the regular one and flip the rest of them on eBay to crazy pony people who don't know how to order comic books properly.

89
00:04:32,641 --> 00:04:36,700
Speaker 0: Even if they know how to order comic books, maybe they didn't think to preorder like this one.

90
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:37,400
Speaker 0: They figured whatever.

91
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,420
Speaker 0: No one's going to buy my little pony.

92
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:43,779
Speaker 1: They're going to go into the comic book store asking for it and they're only going to have the regular cover or it'll be sold out.

93
00:04:44,182 --> 00:04:45,699
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I'll have a full set.

94
00:04:46,641 --> 00:04:52,256
Speaker 0: So I found one number that said a little over twelve thousand comic book stores in the United States.

95
00:04:53,081 --> 00:05:05,199
Speaker 0: I found another number that said thousands and I found a link to a diamond distributors site that claims to have the answer, but doesn't actually become like if you go to the comic shop locator and you just go to every type in every zip code.

96
00:05:05,603 --> 00:05:06,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

97
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:07,592
Speaker 1: I'm going to get on that right now.

98
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:10,548
Speaker 1: We have a database.

99
00:05:10,749 --> 00:05:13,660
Speaker 1: one comic shop locator is a database of every comic shop.

100
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,000
Speaker 1: So if you go through it, you could count anyway.

101
00:05:16,341 --> 00:05:18,340
Speaker 0: Now the question is, how many people use that site?

102
00:05:18,601 --> 00:05:23,833
Speaker 0: And if I wrote a W get script that was going to hit it all night, how long before it shuts down?

103
00:05:24,422 --> 00:05:27,180
Speaker 1: So incompetent you could easily get the data anyway.

104
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,460
Speaker 1: No, I'm worried that I'm going to bring it down that many.

105
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,818
Speaker 1: So here's is something interesting, right?

106
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,439
Speaker 1: Is that I got the preorder form that includes my little pony number two.

107
00:05:38,303 --> 00:05:40,099
Speaker 1: And there were three different covers this time.

108
00:05:41,162 --> 00:05:42,880
Speaker 1: Cover number one was the regular cover.

109
00:05:43,002 --> 00:05:43,718
Speaker 1: So I ordered that one.

110
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:46,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is actually selling better than Uncanny X-Men, right?

111
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:59,179
Speaker 1: Cover number two was a one in, I think, 50 or 25 variant, which means that if you're a comic book store and you order 25 copies of My Little Pony, one of them will have this different cover.

112
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,157
Speaker 1: So if you want two of this different cover, you have to order 50 copies.

113
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,520
Speaker 0: We've talked about why I think the way we distribute comics in this country is ridiculous.

114
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:07,805
Speaker 0: So we don't need to say anything about.

115
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:11,660
Speaker 1: there was a third cover on issue number two that was even more rare.

116
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,351
Speaker 1: I think it was like one in 50 or one in 100. get this cover.

117
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:19,588
Speaker 1: So I was like, oh, might as well buy these and flip them on eBay just like issue number one.

118
00:06:19,709 --> 00:06:20,579
Speaker 1: Crazy pony fan.

119
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,432
Speaker 0: Well, you know, somehow I'm translating you saying that into.

120
00:06:23,794 --> 00:06:26,819
Speaker 0: might as well put them in Lucite and hang them up on my wall.

121
00:06:27,281 --> 00:06:27,563
Speaker 1: Right.

122
00:06:28,086 --> 00:06:30,200
Speaker 1: So they were selling this.

123
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:39,280
Speaker 1: Keep in mind, this is a discount preorder for smart people who know what's up that extra rare cocoa bean My Little Pony number two cover.

124
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,180
Speaker 1: That was these rare variant.

125
00:06:41,581 --> 00:06:42,344
Speaker 1: They were selling.

126
00:06:42,464 --> 00:06:47,340
Speaker 1: I would have had to pay out of my pocket one hundred dollars.

127
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:47,861
Speaker 0: What?

128
00:06:48,384 --> 00:06:50,959
Speaker 1: Fuck that up the ass.

129
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:53,311
Speaker 1: Even though I flipped that on eBay, I wouldn't make shit.

130
00:06:53,814 --> 00:06:56,005
Speaker 1: who's going to pay more than a hundred bucks?

131
00:06:56,528 --> 00:06:58,520
Speaker 0: May how many are being printed?

132
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,000
Speaker 1: Because there's ninety thousand.

133
00:07:01,623 --> 00:07:03,980
Speaker 0: If that comic is a rarity.

134
00:07:04,601 --> 00:07:04,862
Speaker 1: Right.

135
00:07:05,786 --> 00:07:09,080
Speaker 1: If let's say that let's give it a nice because issue two always is a big drop.

136
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:09,404
Speaker 1: Right.

137
00:07:09,424 --> 00:07:10,600
Speaker 1: So let's say seventy five.

138
00:07:10,943 --> 00:07:12,480
Speaker 0: Now, some things have a big drop.

139
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:16,860
Speaker 1: But remember, issue two being my job, conservative estimate ponies goes up.

140
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,820
Speaker 1: Hundred thousand copies is number one.

141
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:19,303
Speaker 1: Right.

142
00:07:20,211 --> 00:07:21,220
Speaker 1: One in a hundred.

143
00:07:21,762 --> 00:07:24,099
Speaker 1: So there's only a thousand of these in the whole earth.

144
00:07:24,301 --> 00:07:25,899
Speaker 1: There's a lot more than a thousand pony fans.

145
00:07:26,324 --> 00:07:27,357
Speaker 1: I'm not paying a hundred bucks.

146
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:32,060
Speaker 1: I'm not going to find a thousand pony fans willing to shop more than a hundred bucks.

147
00:07:32,602 --> 00:07:50,639
Speaker 0: I have this feeling that other than people who listen to geek nights and people who are already fans of My Little Pony and are hardcore enough about it to follow pony news at a time, even at a time like this, when ponies is so far from actually having been on the air with new episodes.

148
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:59,726
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that the geekery of the world is going to discover that the My Little Pony comic is selling really big and that's going to cause another wave of what the fuck bronies.

149
00:08:00,475 --> 00:08:00,840
Speaker 1: We'll see.

150
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,380
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's the point is, is comics probably going to be worth reading.

151
00:08:05,903 --> 00:08:08,800
Speaker 1: There's some free previews online, a little bit, a few pages or so.

152
00:08:09,061 --> 00:08:10,005
Speaker 0: Pretty excited about it.

153
00:08:10,286 --> 00:08:13,357
Speaker 0: And I'm more excited about this than the last 52 comics.

154
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:17,160
Speaker 1: Katie Cook is an awesome brony type person.

155
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:21,199
Speaker 1: So I, you know, I trust her to know what's going on.

156
00:08:22,381 --> 00:08:27,584
Speaker 1: So if you want to read this comic, you should a) someone's going to scan it in on the Internet.

157
00:08:27,665 --> 00:08:28,479
Speaker 1: You know, that's going to happen.

158
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:36,140
Speaker 1: B) Get the trade, which will come out and you just buy it on Amazon, no problem, super cheap and will not be collectible or expensive in any way.

159
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:44,939
Speaker 0: I wonder if when that's on Amazon, that'll be about six months from now, the bronies will do what happens with Firefly and everything else where they just keep buying extra copies of it and sits in the number one for a while.

160
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:47,099
Speaker 1: And it'll be six months from now.

161
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,307
Speaker 0: That would be an interesting measure.

162
00:08:48,327 --> 00:08:50,420
Speaker 0: But I don't even know.

163
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,839
Speaker 0: I do know this is all expected.

164
00:08:54,120 --> 00:09:07,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, things of the day, you might remember quite some time ago we interviewed the Oda King on our show.

165
00:09:08,563 --> 00:09:11,720
Speaker 0: He was talking about translation and how fansubbers are dumbasses.

166
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:13,340
Speaker 0: And it was a great interview.

167
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,108
Speaker 0: He's a great guy.

168
00:09:14,189 --> 00:09:15,160
Speaker 0: He's done cool stuff.

169
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:19,705
Speaker 0: There are many things he has done and many of you might be familiar with him, but I don't need to get into that.

170
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,539
Speaker 0: He did yet another thing.

171
00:09:21,961 --> 00:09:27,436
Speaker 0: And it's interesting because a lot of the people I know who saw this didn't know it was him who did it.

172
00:09:27,761 --> 00:09:30,100
Speaker 1: Neither did I until someone pointed it out and I said, wait.

173
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:35,380
Speaker 0: But when they watched it, said something like, hey, this is kind of like what the Oda King did before.

174
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,560
Speaker 1: It looks like his style.

175
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it is him.

176
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:53,559
Speaker 0: All I have to say is that if there was a thing that would make me more excited than Ghost in the Shell standalone complex third gig, because it doesn't exist, or My Little Pony, it would be a Star Wars anime that looked like this.

177
00:09:55,364 --> 00:09:56,177
Speaker 0: I just watch it.

178
00:09:56,841 --> 00:10:02,519
Speaker 0: And if you don't think this is one of the greatest things you've ever seen, you're either a terrible person or you're way too young.

179
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:09,920
Speaker 1: OK, so I saw a link to a funny video on YouTube and it was all about Halloween costumes.

180
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,700
Speaker 1: It was a funny little cute animation.

181
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:15,780
Speaker 1: And I noticed that it was part of this YouTube channel, Sleeping Ninja Toast.

182
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:24,479
Speaker 1: So I check out the channel and it has many other hilarious and cute animations in it, mostly about Zelda and tongues.

183
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:35,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, I highly suggest you watch obviously the Halloween costume animation that brought me into this, but also every video in this channel, especially my summed up experience in Twilight Princess.

184
00:10:39,022 --> 00:10:45,399
Speaker 0: This is the kind of thing where it's really cute, but I feel like we're going to see the girl who's making this stuff like a couple of years from now.

185
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:54,380
Speaker 1: You can tell watching these videos that whoever is the person doing this is someone with talents who is going to bust out onto the scene.

186
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,440
Speaker 0: I think very similar.

187
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,660
Speaker 0: You know what this reminds me of the kid who did that Lavender Town expose.

188
00:10:59,741 --> 00:11:02,732
Speaker 1: Like very well, I think it's a little better than that equal.

189
00:11:02,813 --> 00:11:07,060
Speaker 0: equal in terms of what I project to be their potential for YouTube.

190
00:11:07,641 --> 00:11:10,940
Speaker 1: This is this is a person who is young and has high talent and is productive.

191
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:25,780
Speaker 1: And especially if you watch the video, there's a video where they demonstrate how to draw Zelda in flash like, you know, they drew a picture of regular Zelda, just, you know, like a rat, you know, just a pencil, scan it in and then draw vector Zelda on top of it.

192
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,160
Speaker 1: You can tell this person knows what they're doing.

193
00:11:28,464 --> 00:11:40,040
Speaker 1: I expect great things in the future to subscribe to this YouTube channel and you will see things possibly before they explode on the Internet and discover this person before they are super popular and famous.

194
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:44,799
Speaker 1: I bet they're going to be busting out in artist's alleys and other places soon enough, if not already.

195
00:11:47,002 --> 00:11:58,680
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, very briefly, before we get into this, this amazing burning, burning con is this this this weekend, also including what you got to get a stutter stutter, stutter looting Sunday.

196
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:02,640
Speaker 0: I'm running a game in the first slot on Saturday.

197
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:06,040
Speaker 1: I'm running even the last slot on Sunday.

198
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,920
Speaker 1: So basically, it's a lot mean Scott bookending the convention.

199
00:12:11,062 --> 00:12:12,239
Speaker 1: I'm in the bed slot.

200
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:13,280
Speaker 0: I think it's a fine.

201
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,125
Speaker 1: So it's a bad slide because everyone's already left and everyone's tired and no one gives a shit.

202
00:12:17,206 --> 00:12:18,300
Speaker 0: I don't leave burning con.

203
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:20,220
Speaker 0: I usually leave, though.

204
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:21,619
Speaker 1: I don't leave, but other people do.

205
00:12:21,863 --> 00:12:22,600
Speaker 0: I think you'll be fine.

206
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:23,390
Speaker 0: We have enough.

207
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:24,180
Speaker 0: Legend of Krauser.

208
00:12:24,361 --> 00:12:25,679
Speaker 0: I think people will join our games.

209
00:12:25,981 --> 00:12:26,442
Speaker 1: I hope so.

210
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:32,123
Speaker 0: The thing is, I get to set the bar for every game everyone else plays and who starts with mine.

211
00:12:32,163 --> 00:12:37,586
Speaker 1: I also think, you know, I look through a lot the game schedule and it's like careful.

212
00:12:37,606 --> 00:12:39,020
Speaker 0: A lot of those people listen to gig nights.

213
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:39,904
Speaker 0: What are you about to say?

214
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:46,760
Speaker 1: A lot of the games I want to play in are all at the same slots and not I want to play in inheritance.

215
00:12:47,824 --> 00:12:48,920
Speaker 1: I already did inheritance.

216
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:49,627
Speaker 0: It's changed it.

217
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:50,599
Speaker 0: It's a larp now.

218
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:52,359
Speaker 1: And that makes me want to do it less.

219
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:53,003
Speaker 0: Really?

220
00:12:53,023 --> 00:12:54,620
Speaker 1: Already done that.

221
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,419
Speaker 1: I want to do new stuff.

222
00:12:56,405 --> 00:12:57,500
Speaker 0: You got a lot of opportunities.

223
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,598
Speaker 0: How many slots are there?

224
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,090
Speaker 0: Lots of five.

225
00:13:00,395 --> 00:13:00,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

226
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:07,000
Speaker 0: Five Saturday to Sunday anime Boston a ways out Magfest.

227
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,760
Speaker 0: We're finalizing our schedule for what we're doing at Magfest.

228
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,539
Speaker 0: But rest assured, we're going to be a fucking Magfest.

229
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:13,219
Speaker 1: Fuck yeah.

Speaker 0: I'm going to buy my badge probably tonight, even in case really in case it's one sells out to somehow we don't get to lecture at it.

234

235
00:13:40,381 --> 00:13:41,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what you're going for.

236
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:42,776
Speaker 0: That's what I'm going for.

237
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:43,720
Speaker 1: All right.

238
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:48,048
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll buy one by two then by two that I'll have to buy three because Emily's coming to.

239
00:13:48,088 --> 00:13:48,720
Speaker 1: what are we seeing?

240
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,120
Speaker 1: How is there?

241
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:54,179
Speaker 0: How do we sell them off if I don't know how we're going to manage that?

242
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:57,180
Speaker 0: I haven't done any planning for this trip yet.

243
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,079
Speaker 0: All I know is it cost about two grand if we fly coach.

244
00:14:00,644 --> 00:14:01,099
Speaker 1: That's cool.

245
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,278
Speaker 0: It's not that bad.

246
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,520
Speaker 1: The thing is, it's like one grand to fly to Seattle.

247
00:14:05,921 --> 00:14:07,277
Speaker 1: So just two Seattle's.

248
00:14:07,981 --> 00:14:12,979
Speaker 0: If you fly a little bit off like we did, I was like 400 bucks to fly to Seattle.

249
00:14:13,963 --> 00:14:15,358
Speaker 1: No, I mean, and back and back.

250
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,440
Speaker 0: No, you bought your ticket after me.

251
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:23,660
Speaker 0: My flight there was well, my flight back was nothing because we flew back Monday night.

252
00:14:23,942 --> 00:14:26,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's, you know, it's a few hundred dollars each way.

253
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:30,038
Speaker 1: Comes out close, you know, give you between eight hundred and a thousand dollars for the round trip.

254
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:38,256
Speaker 0: I've never paid more than six hundred dollars round trip to packs because you can get one of the flights for like one hundred and twenty bucks every time.

255
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:41,019
Speaker 1: JetBlue, the direct flight.

256
00:14:41,523 --> 00:14:42,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, just don't fly.

257
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,198
Speaker 0: You got to fly at the right times.

258
00:14:45,064 --> 00:14:46,000
Speaker 1: We fly in the same flight.

259
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:46,321
Speaker 0: Yeah.

260
00:14:46,342 --> 00:14:47,600
Speaker 0: And I always buy the tickets first.

261
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,040
Speaker 0: Then I'm like, Scott, buy this flight.

262
00:14:49,180 --> 00:14:50,698
Speaker 0: Usually the cheap seats are sold out by then.

263
00:14:52,301 --> 00:14:53,939
Speaker 0: Anyway, join the forum.

264
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,000
Speaker 0: Check out our Internet shit.

265
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,339
Speaker 0: We uploaded a radio for Equestria since ponies are coming up again.

266
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to send out a newsletter probably real soon.

267
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:06,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're going to do more radio for Equestria and we're going to do another show because enough of you said you wanted us to do it.

268
00:15:07,521 --> 00:15:11,799
Speaker 0: We're going to do the RFE treatment on Shoujo Kakumei Utena.

269
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,960
Speaker 1: Gotta watch it first.

270
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:16,837
Speaker 0: We're going to watch it episode by episode and do a show on the show, dog.

271
00:15:18,321 --> 00:15:19,178
Speaker 0: OK, so.

272
00:15:20,262 --> 00:15:22,800
Speaker 0: We skipped one, two, three, four and five.

273
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,533
Speaker 0: I've only seen, I don't know, seven episodes of the book.

274
00:15:27,553 --> 00:15:31,194
Speaker 1: club book is name of the wind, name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

275
00:15:32,102 --> 00:15:32,890
Speaker 1: So read that shit.

276
00:15:33,132 --> 00:15:33,900
Speaker 0: OK, just the first book.

277
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,399
Speaker 0: I'm about a third of the way through.

278
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:43,399
Speaker 0: And I just got to the point where the kids like, you know what, I'm going to stop being a dumb ass and I'm going to become a man now.

279
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,704
Speaker 1: That's the good part.

280
00:15:44,805 --> 00:15:51,031
Speaker 0: Also, so far, this plot is very similar to Elminster, The Making of a Mage, which is a fuck out of the realm's book.

281
00:15:51,292 --> 00:15:53,167
Speaker 0: that takes you through the life of Elminster.

282
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:54,019
Speaker 0: And you know what?

283
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:57,040
Speaker 0: Elminster also became a poor street urchin thief.

284
00:15:58,925 --> 00:15:59,960
Speaker 0: The parallels are astounding.

285
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,040
Speaker 1: Are you saying it's a rip off?

286
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:05,940
Speaker 0: I'm not sure because Elminster, Making of a Mage is a pretty awful book.

287
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:08,059
Speaker 0: So tell me this.

288
00:16:08,200 --> 00:16:09,078
Speaker 0: I can ask you one thing.

289
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:18,635
Speaker 0: Does the main character in our book club book, The Name of the Wind, become a girl and have an elf have sex with him and learn magic better?

290
00:16:18,716 --> 00:16:20,208
Speaker 0: because women are better at magic than men?

291
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:20,738
Speaker 1: Not yet.

292
00:16:23,062 --> 00:16:25,399
Speaker 0: OK, if that happens, this book is a rip off.

293
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:32,260
Speaker 0: OK, so we I've seen maybe seven episodes of One Piece.

294
00:16:33,202 --> 00:16:36,840
Speaker 0: I lectured on the anime opener to One Piece.

295
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:37,227
Speaker 0: Great.

296
00:16:37,247 --> 00:16:37,940
Speaker 1: That's so relevant.

297
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,879
Speaker 0: In different languages.

298
00:16:39,621 --> 00:16:42,400
Speaker 1: I read eleven volumes of the One Piece manga, the first eleven.

299
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,160
Speaker 0: I read one volume of the One Piece manga.

300
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:48,280
Speaker 0: And I listened to four episodes of Anime Pulse.

301
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:53,560
Speaker 1: I have seen a handful of the first ever episodes of TV One Piece.

302
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,353
Speaker 1: And that's pretty much it.

303
00:16:57,514 --> 00:16:58,540
Speaker 1: before seeing this movie.

304
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,940
Speaker 0: One Piece six, the sixth movie.

305
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,041
Speaker 1: I told you why you watch this one, because it's the one we could download the English subtitle.

306
00:17:06,061 --> 00:17:14,640
Speaker 0: So we skipped One Piece, Clockwork Island Adventure, Chopper's Kingdom on the Island of Strange Animals, Dead End Adventure, The Cursed Holy Sword.

307
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:18,940
Speaker 0: And when we watched Baron Omatsuri and the Secret Island.

308
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:23,563
Speaker 1: So as soon as this starts, within 30 seconds, we're already like Slayer's movie, Ebro's Island.

309
00:17:24,306 --> 00:17:32,980
Speaker 0: Now, you might think that's totally superficial because, all right, we're watching one of those OAV-ish movies from a TV show kind of stand alone.

310
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is one of those things where it's like, OK, it's the characters you love.

311
00:17:37,081 --> 00:17:40,660
Speaker 1: We came up with this all new story that's unrelated to anything else.

312
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:46,768
Speaker 1: They literally go to an island separated from the world, go on an adventure, and then there's an end.

313
00:17:46,869 --> 00:17:47,820
Speaker 1: And that's the whole movie.

314
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:48,581
Speaker 1: Right.

315
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:52,140
Speaker 1: But it's just like the Slayer's movie, just like a lot of Lupin movies.

316
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:58,660
Speaker 0: But it was very telling because as we're watching the very beginning, it really felt a lot like Ebro's Island.

317
00:17:59,181 --> 00:18:11,918
Speaker 0: And then I realized about halfway through this thing that it's also a Lupin movie and that all those not the good Lupin movies, no AVs, but the and not the really bad ones, but like the mediocre ones.

318
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:15,279
Speaker 0: It's not that it's like a movie like that.

319
00:18:15,563 --> 00:18:15,928
Speaker 1: It is.

320
00:18:15,949 --> 00:18:16,030
Speaker 1: Yeah.

321
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:26,320
Speaker 0: Literally, if you just took this and replaced all the characters with Lupin characters and changed the proper nouns of their dialogue, it might as well be a Lupin movie.

322
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,998
Speaker 1: It might as well be the Slayer's movie if you change it, right?

323
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,277
Speaker 0: It's like, I've no, no, no, no.

324
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,819
Speaker 0: Well, it might as well be a Slayer's movie in terms of style and theme and story.

325
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,902
Speaker 0: In terms of the interactions between the characters, there's one scene where they're on the boat.

326
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:42,920
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, that's Zenigata, not Zenigata, that's Goemon.

327
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:43,401
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

328
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:46,479
Speaker 0: And again, like to the point that they could even say the same lines.

329
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:51,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was so I I almost pictured it as a Lupin movie.

330
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:59,717
Speaker 0: There's something about these like tier two mediocre anime OAV-ish movies to where they're all the same.

331
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:04,380
Speaker 1: Well, it seems to me like, you know, this sort of two kinds of anime movies, right?

332
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,780
Speaker 1: There's the real anime movies, which are sort of original.

333
00:19:08,122 --> 00:19:09,420
Speaker 1: They're separate from everything else.

334
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:17,080
Speaker 1: You know, the girl who lived through time is a Miyazaki movie or, you know, a Satoshi Khan movie or a Mamoruji movie.

335
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:17,442
Speaker 1: Right.

336
00:19:17,743 --> 00:19:22,084
Speaker 1: These things really stand alone as like these, you know, even like Pat LeBourne movie one.

337
00:19:22,104 --> 00:19:24,700
Speaker 1: Would you think, oh, that's related to like this TV series and stuff?

338
00:19:24,883 --> 00:19:25,820
Speaker 1: No, it stands alone.

339
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:26,747
Speaker 1: It stands alone.

340
00:19:26,767 --> 00:19:28,058
Speaker 1: It's like this awesome movie.

341
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:31,180
Speaker 1: It's got its own real plot and everything.

342
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:34,940
Speaker 0: Now, this does stand alone in the sense that its plot is self-contained.

343
00:19:35,101 --> 00:19:41,140
Speaker 0: And even if you know nothing at all about the characters, it kind of goes out of its way to explain everything about the characters.

344
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:44,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least everything you need to know to understand the movie you're watching.

345
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:45,906
Speaker 1: I'm sure you can't swim.

346
00:19:48,461 --> 00:19:48,802
Speaker 0: Right.

347
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:53,383
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, I knew that before, but, you know, some other people might not have.

348
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:58,379
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's like, you know, there's this other class of anime movie.

349
00:19:58,459 --> 00:20:02,560
Speaker 1: that's not the compilation movie, but these sort of series movies, the Pokemon.

350
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:10,220
Speaker 1: You know, it felt a lot like watching that third Pokemon movie or Lupin movie or, you know, any of those where there's movies are in a series.

351
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:14,680
Speaker 0: But again, not a good anime movie, a mediocre one.

352
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm we're talking like Momo.

353
00:20:17,701 --> 00:20:20,340
Speaker 1: Like not worth spending time to watch.

354
00:20:20,621 --> 00:20:23,260
Speaker 1: Now, it has the, you know, the same sort of plot structure.

355
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:23,603
Speaker 1: Right.

356
00:20:24,711 --> 00:20:25,980
Speaker 1: Here's all the characters you love.

357
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:26,924
Speaker 1: Let's introduce them.

358
00:20:27,507 --> 00:20:30,459
Speaker 1: Here is a some sort of hook for the thing they're going to do.

359
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:31,624
Speaker 1: They go there.

360
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:41,015
Speaker 1: There's something mysterious and there's some sort of silly and lighthearted introductory conflicts with lots of humor because of the beginning of the movie and lots of action.

361
00:20:41,157 --> 00:20:41,380
Speaker 1: Right.

362
00:20:42,001 --> 00:20:48,953
Speaker 1: And then the action starts to get a little more serious and some of the characters start to discover the mysterious thing that's going on.

363
00:20:49,034 --> 00:20:51,103
Speaker 0: all of this, even in the lighthearted part in the beginning.

364
00:20:51,143 --> 00:20:56,353
Speaker 0: There's always the the very obvious, sinister undertones, but nothing overt.

365
00:20:56,638 --> 00:20:56,780
Speaker 0: Yeah.

366
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,760
Speaker 0: And it just feels like in this movie, it zooms in on this flower on the guy's shoulder.

367
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,688
Speaker 1: And, you know, we know immediately.

368
00:21:02,848 --> 00:21:06,366
Speaker 1: anyone who has half a brain knows immediately that guy's a bad guy.

369
00:21:06,547 --> 00:21:08,620
Speaker 1: That flowers the square boss, the end the end.

370
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:08,901
Speaker 1: Right.

371
00:21:08,921 --> 00:21:10,920
Speaker 1: You know, everything they show you this volcano.

372
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:11,564
Speaker 1: You're like the endings.

373
00:21:11,685 --> 00:21:14,954
Speaker 1: I said immediately beginning of the movie, the movie is going to end on top of that volcano.

374
00:21:14,995 --> 00:21:15,420
Speaker 1: Was I right?

375
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,171
Speaker 1: You were right.

376
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:16,580
Speaker 1: I was right.

377
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,092
Speaker 1: I didn't even two seconds of the movie.

378
00:21:18,112 --> 00:21:19,000
Speaker 1: Didn't even know what the plot was.

379
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,519
Speaker 1: They said they show you a volcano.

380
00:21:20,661 --> 00:21:21,608
Speaker 1: They're approaching this island.

381
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:23,264
Speaker 1: I'm like, end of the movie is going to be on the volcano.

382
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:24,140
Speaker 0: So one other warning.

383
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:26,220
Speaker 0: I read a thing on the One Piece movies.

384
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:27,813
Speaker 0: It was like, yeah, they're all about 50 to 55 minutes.

385
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:36,752
Speaker 0: So the first One Piece movie, 51 minutes, second one, 55 minutes, third one, 56 minutes, fourth one, 95 minutes, 95 minutes, 95 minutes.

386
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,100
Speaker 0: They basically escalated.

387
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,799
Speaker 0: One hundred and thirteen minutes.

388
00:21:42,422 --> 00:21:43,459
Speaker 1: But how long is the one we watched?

389
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:47,300
Speaker 0: The one we watched was 90 something minutes.

390
00:21:47,981 --> 00:21:48,121
Speaker 1: Right.

391
00:21:48,282 --> 00:21:48,483
Speaker 1: Yeah.

392
00:21:48,523 --> 00:21:52,608
Speaker 1: We we went into this thinking it was going to be much shorter than like 50 minutes in.

393
00:21:52,669 --> 00:21:53,114
Speaker 1: We're like, what?

394
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:56,980
Speaker 1: And we go down to look at the progress bar and it's a little bit over half.

395
00:21:57,122 --> 00:21:57,959
Speaker 1: We're like, what?

396
00:21:58,101 --> 00:22:04,680
Speaker 0: At one point near the end, there's the scene that's just black and Luffy's just talking to himself and the pirate guys talking to himself.

397
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:08,899
Speaker 0: And I'm like, and I clicked forward quite a bit.

398
00:22:10,122 --> 00:22:11,091
Speaker 0: Screen was still black.

399
00:22:11,151 --> 00:22:12,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's be honest.

400
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:12,341
Speaker 1: Right.

401
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:14,620
Speaker 1: We got after we saw that we were only halfway through.

402
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,046
Speaker 1: We sort of checked.

403
00:22:16,186 --> 00:22:18,940
Speaker 1: We sort of click through quickly to look at each scene.

404
00:22:19,342 --> 00:22:23,583
Speaker 1: But we didn't actually watch the rest in the entirety because that would have taken forever.

405
00:22:23,724 --> 00:22:26,802
Speaker 1: And it was sort of unnecessary because we knew exactly what was going to happen.

406
00:22:27,103 --> 00:22:37,647
Speaker 1: The only thing I didn't know, you know, predict that was accurate was the fact that, you know, after the square boss was revealed and, you know, they had the final encounter with the final bad guy.

407
00:22:37,687 --> 00:22:43,179
Speaker 1: and the dire moment, you know, everything gets all trippy, of course, and dark and spooky.

408
00:22:43,981 --> 00:22:44,404
Speaker 0: Of course.

409
00:22:44,565 --> 00:22:46,800
Speaker 0: Usually they don't get this this movie.

410
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:52,179
Speaker 0: I was but for the end, I would have said this was not worth watching at all.

411
00:22:52,842 --> 00:22:55,655
Speaker 0: But the end is actually pretty odd.

412
00:22:56,841 --> 00:23:01,260
Speaker 1: It's where it is trippier and visually and aesthetically than I expected.

413
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:01,945
Speaker 1: But it was still.

414
00:23:01,985 --> 00:23:03,479
Speaker 1: I still expected trippiness at the end.

415
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:03,781
Speaker 1: Right.

416
00:23:05,388 --> 00:23:08,380
Speaker 1: That ending part was much extended.

417
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:14,980
Speaker 0: Like usually it's like you reveal the square boss and within 10 minutes in Sailor Moon, when the evil flower on the guy's shoulders revealed is the bad guy.

418
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:15,764
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

419
00:23:16,831 --> 00:23:18,219
Speaker 1: There's like to feed him then.

420
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:18,702
Speaker 1: Yeah.

421
00:23:18,742 --> 00:23:22,760
Speaker 1: It's like once you see the square boss, it's like and it's the over.

422
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,021
Speaker 1: Right.

423
00:23:23,302 --> 00:23:32,700
Speaker 1: In this, like shit's revealed and that the battle with the revealed ending square boss lasts a long, good percentage of the movie.

424
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:35,960
Speaker 0: You look at the Mepros Island movie and all these other kind of movies like it.

425
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:47,283
Speaker 0: One thing I've noticed about the one characteristic is that the movie will have very long scenes where very little happens, very, very atmospheric and very atypical of the show there.

426
00:23:47,303 --> 00:23:49,959
Speaker 1: But I mean, the Cowboy Bebop movie is the worst of those.

427
00:23:50,341 --> 00:23:50,542
Speaker 1: Right.

428
00:23:50,582 --> 00:23:57,040
Speaker 1: In terms of I mean, not that those scenes are bad, but just saying it has lots of long scenes where literally nothing happens.

429
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:57,402
Speaker 1: Like now.

430
00:23:57,442 --> 00:24:02,740
Speaker 1: another is like a five to 10 minute scene of Ed walking around town while the song plays, even though that's one of the best scenes in the movie.

431
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:03,604
Speaker 1: It's nothing wrong with.

432
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:07,141
Speaker 1: I'm just saying is this talk about long scenes where nothing happens.

433
00:24:07,162 --> 00:24:10,617
Speaker 0: There's a scene where Chopper gets waylaid in the typical.

434
00:24:10,677 --> 00:24:12,759
Speaker 0: the sinister thing finally catches him when he's alone.

435
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,243
Speaker 0: These are movies.

436
00:24:14,323 --> 00:24:19,786
Speaker 0: It's like in a bubble gum crisis where I'm going in for a closer look means I'm going to die.

437
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:22,159
Speaker 0: Tell my kids I love them in a movie like this.

438
00:24:22,701 --> 00:24:26,520
Speaker 0: I'm going to go explore around the island by myself and see if I can figure anything out.

439
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,280
Speaker 0: is also code for an arrow is going to fucking kill me.

440
00:24:29,481 --> 00:24:29,807
Speaker 0: The end.

441
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:30,459
Speaker 1: Yeah.

442
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:38,240
Speaker 0: But so there's a scene where choppers walk in and there's this really sort of surreal someone watching him thing and all these angle cuts.

443
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,345
Speaker 0: It's an interesting scene.

444
00:24:39,365 --> 00:24:48,102
Speaker 0: I actually really liked how the scene was played out, very similar to a scene in Ursa Yatsura to a beautiful dreamer, which also does all these things.

445
00:24:48,644 --> 00:24:56,480
Speaker 0: And what's interesting there is that Ursa Yatsura to a beautiful dreamer was directed by Oshii and was very atypical of even the rest of the other movies.

446
00:24:57,341 --> 00:25:01,580
Speaker 0: This movie, the one we watched, was directed by Mamoru Hosoda.

447
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:03,609
Speaker 0: I saw it in the credits.

448
00:25:03,650 --> 00:25:05,100
Speaker 0: I was like, can't be the same guy.

449
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:10,580
Speaker 0: Totally the same guy as in the same guy who did the girl who left her time.

450
00:25:11,503 --> 00:25:11,726
Speaker 0: Yep.

451
00:25:11,868 --> 00:25:12,659
Speaker 0: Summer Wars.

452
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:13,745
Speaker 0: Yep.

453
00:25:13,825 --> 00:25:15,240
Speaker 0: The Yu Yu Hakusho movie.

454
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,112
Speaker 1: I know who it is.

455
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:16,398
Speaker 1: Yeah.

456
00:25:19,523 --> 00:25:21,019
Speaker 0: So what was this movie about?

457
00:25:22,743 --> 00:25:24,980
Speaker 1: Just a one piece character adventure.

458
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:26,760
Speaker 1: You know, they go to an island.

459
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:30,900
Speaker 1: They think it's going to be a resort, you know, and they're going to have a good time.

460
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:37,399
Speaker 1: In actuality, it's some guy who presents them with challenges because, I mean, you can't have a tournament in one movie, but you can have challenges.

461
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:47,959
Speaker 1: I was so waiting for that challenge to be a tournament at, you know, secretly and obviously the island is actually full of evil and they because they're good at the challenges, they get pulled into the evil part.

462
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:53,682
Speaker 1: And after they all get a bunch of them get captured, of course, you know, Love is the main character.

463
00:25:53,723 --> 00:25:58,944
Speaker 1: He saves the day at the very end after everyone else saves the minor day all throughout the movie.

464
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:06,538
Speaker 1: He saves the big day in with the help of some of the characters who are just created for this movie, you know, and that's it.

465
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:16,779
Speaker 0: A lot of trippy stuff happens, though, and I didn't expect that all the characters kind of got eaten by the flower and turned into goop.

466
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,018
Speaker 0: Somehow they became human again.

467
00:26:19,502 --> 00:26:23,060
Speaker 0: And the inside of the square boss is filled with filled with utenna.

468
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,087
Speaker 0: Let's put it that way.

469
00:26:24,714 --> 00:26:25,320
Speaker 0: It is filled.

470
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:29,440
Speaker 0: I couldn't watch all of utenna and then watch this movie.

471
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:30,587
Speaker 0: And you'll know exactly what I mean.

472
00:26:30,628 --> 00:26:32,139
Speaker 0: There's no other way to describe that.

473
00:26:34,528 --> 00:26:34,569
Speaker 0: No.

474
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:35,439
Speaker 0: Movie's pretty bad.

475
00:26:36,021 --> 00:26:36,704
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not.

476
00:26:36,824 --> 00:26:40,320
Speaker 1: I don't think you should really go out of your way to see this.

477
00:26:40,641 --> 00:26:40,943
Speaker 1: Right.

478
00:26:40,984 --> 00:26:43,480
Speaker 1: I mean, who knows about the other one piece movies?

479
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:48,740
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm someone who is a fan of part of one piece like when I be pirates.

480
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

481
00:26:49,061 --> 00:26:53,222
Speaker 1: When I read one piece or watch the TV series, there's good parts, there's boring parts.

482
00:26:53,263 --> 00:26:55,300
Speaker 1: The boring parts are fights that last too long.

483
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,219
Speaker 1: The good parts are all the other parts.

484
00:26:57,722 --> 00:26:58,365
Speaker 1: It's just fights.

485
00:26:58,425 --> 00:27:01,099
Speaker 1: last too long is the better percentage of it.

486
00:27:01,741 --> 00:27:05,576
Speaker 1: So, you know, it's like 25 percent of one piece is the best and 75 percent is boring.

487
00:27:06,721 --> 00:27:11,100
Speaker 1: And this movie did not have any of the good parts at all.

488
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:11,603
Speaker 1: Really.

489
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:12,678
Speaker 1: Very, very few of them.

490
00:27:13,981 --> 00:27:16,080
Speaker 1: You'd have to be like a crazy one piece fan.

491
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,320
Speaker 1: Need to see all the one piece to watch this movie.

492
00:27:20,101 --> 00:27:27,920
Speaker 1: Or maybe you're studying, you know, all of the anime movies that have this identical structure, in which case you need to see this one because it is a perfect example.

493
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:32,519
Speaker 0: I feel like we could turn this into a panel if we put work into it on showing all these media.

494
00:27:33,222 --> 00:27:42,839
Speaker 1: A whole bunch of movies and show how they're exactly the same goddamn movie and be like we can call the panel like seen one anime movie, seen them all.

495
00:27:43,421 --> 00:27:53,941
Speaker 0: Now, what's interesting is that the the movie internally, it jumps around a lot, like very jarring transitions between scenes, which actually the Mipros Island movie kind of did that.

496
00:27:53,961 --> 00:27:59,447
Speaker 1: Well, I think what early on in the movie, the cameras really in one place, right, because all the characters are together.

497
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:06,825
Speaker 1: But then the characters sort to start to split up and it's cutting between what all the different characters are doing, supposedly at the same time.

498
00:28:06,845 --> 00:28:10,785
Speaker 1: And that's where things can get a little bit confusing because the timing doesn't make any sense.

499
00:28:10,825 --> 00:28:19,600
Speaker 1: No, but also you look at something like Lupin, there's Lupin, Jigen, Goemon and maybe they'll show you Fujiko, right?

500
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:23,000
Speaker 0: Or well, Zenigata is there, but every now and then you cut to Zenigata.

501
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:30,119
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, hardly ever do they actually, you know, depending on the movie, they might need it to only show Lupin and Fujiko and that's it.

502
00:28:30,381 --> 00:28:30,683
Speaker 1: Right.

503
00:28:30,724 --> 00:28:32,820
Speaker 1: I mean, or, you know, Lupin and the bad guy.

504
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,341
Speaker 1: And that's it.

505
00:28:33,682 --> 00:28:39,642
Speaker 1: And this they got to keep going to every different character in Luffy's crew.

506
00:28:39,682 --> 00:28:42,580
Speaker 1: And his crew is like, you know, seven people in it.

507
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,365
Speaker 1: There were people in the crew.

508
00:28:43,406 --> 00:28:45,280
Speaker 1: I didn't know because I never got that far in one piece.

509
00:28:45,381 --> 00:28:45,523
Speaker 1: Right.

510
00:28:45,544 --> 00:28:46,680
Speaker 1: Like, who's that girl with the black?

511
00:28:47,241 --> 00:28:48,000
Speaker 0: I have no idea who that girl.

512
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,884
Speaker 1: I don't know who Robin is.

513
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:52,285
Speaker 1: I've never seen that red or seen that far in the one piece regular series.

514
00:28:52,305 --> 00:28:54,580
Speaker 0: My problem with her is that she's too cool and confident.

515
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,279
Speaker 0: She doesn't fit in his crew at all.

516
00:28:56,521 --> 00:29:02,020
Speaker 1: No, you know, but Luffy is more like a Captain Taylor situation.

517
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:04,220
Speaker 1: Tyler, where he's cool and confident.

518
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:04,864
Speaker 1: But is he?

519
00:29:05,611 --> 00:29:06,500
Speaker 1: But he gets it done.

520
00:29:09,663 --> 00:29:16,740
Speaker 1: But yeah, they keep cutting between the characters until, of course, the secret evil guy removes the characters from the picture one at a time also.

521
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:18,139
Speaker 1: But that takes a while.

522
00:29:18,463 --> 00:29:19,680
Speaker 1: That's like halfway through the movie.

523
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,300
Speaker 1: They start going out of the picture.

524
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:24,686
Speaker 0: So, yeah, I mean, you think at first it feels like there's going to be these four challenges.

525
00:29:24,746 --> 00:29:25,999
Speaker 0: They have to pick up the goldfish.

526
00:29:26,842 --> 00:29:31,020
Speaker 0: And then they have a speedboat race where they have to throw hoops at each other.

527
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,439
Speaker 1: That one was weird.

528
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:35,300
Speaker 0: And that one went on for like a half hour.

529
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:36,161
Speaker 1: Yeah.

530
00:29:36,765 --> 00:29:39,000
Speaker 0: And I guess we should have seen that come in a fight that takes forever.

531
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:39,761
Speaker 1: Right.

532
00:29:40,544 --> 00:29:44,600
Speaker 1: At least there weren't too many direct fights other than the ending fight.

533
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,711
Speaker 0: Wait, spoiler, spoiler.

534
00:29:47,381 --> 00:29:50,360
Speaker 0: And the very end, there's a dude who appears a bit through the movie.

535
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:51,258
Speaker 1: Good guys win.

536
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,203
Speaker 0: He's an uncle.

537
00:29:52,524 --> 00:29:55,860
Speaker 0: And the uncle is trying to be a badass for his kids, but he's a coward.

538
00:29:56,222 --> 00:30:00,040
Speaker 0: And then finally, he minds up and hardens up and he's going to do the good thing.

539
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:06,600
Speaker 0: He picks up the bow and arrow and he shoots it at the bad guy, the square boss, and it just fucking kills the square boss.

540
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:06,982
Speaker 0: The end.

541
00:30:08,312 --> 00:30:09,320
Speaker 0: It just it just works.

542
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,280
Speaker 0: Why didn't anyone do that before?

543
00:30:13,163 --> 00:30:14,419
Speaker 0: Why was it so easy to kill then?

544
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,211
Speaker 0: Suddenly, I don't know.

545
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:18,459
Speaker 0: Granted, we skipped a bit.

546
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:20,899
Speaker 0: Maybe there's some baby ate some gum, gum, I don't know.

547
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:21,502
Speaker 1: I don't know.

548
00:30:21,522 --> 00:30:24,020
Speaker 0: This movie is weird.

549
00:30:24,802 --> 00:30:27,400
Speaker 0: And you can kind of see the influence of Hosoda.

550
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:37,700
Speaker 0: But I feel I think one of the things that drives all these movies to be similar is that you're either directly constrained if you work on one of these, because you can't kill a character.

551
00:30:38,262 --> 00:30:43,119
Speaker 0: You can't alter the relationship between any main character and any other main character.

552
00:30:44,123 --> 00:30:46,080
Speaker 0: You can't change the world's plots.

553
00:30:46,180 --> 00:30:49,820
Speaker 0: You always have to be in a setting that's like separate, like a special island somewhere.

554
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:50,302
Speaker 0: Right.

555
00:30:50,322 --> 00:30:51,419
Speaker 1: So basically what you do is you write it.

556
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,480
Speaker 1: You take the characters with their personalities.

557
00:30:54,090 --> 00:31:04,759
Speaker 1: You write a self-contained fan fiction story for those characters, and you make sure to reset the status quo and send the main characters on their way again at the end without any permanent change to them.

558
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:11,260
Speaker 1: And you also, because you need to have permanent change, create some temporary characters that you can have a permanent change for.

559
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:21,479
Speaker 1: A bad guy who gets defeated, you know, some help, some helpful local characters who improve and, you know, develop as characters and such that will never, ever be seen again.

560
00:31:22,204 --> 00:31:24,300
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's the same thing happens every time.

561
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like that's part of it.

562
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:36,899
Speaker 0: And I think that's why some of the movies like this that really stand out, like particularly a Lupin or two, is because they took great liberties anyway and they went way out of character and did interesting stuff.

563
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,220
Speaker 0: Maybe this movie.

564
00:31:39,901 --> 00:31:40,524
Speaker 0: It was so.

565
00:31:40,584 --> 00:31:48,240
Speaker 0: the interactions between his crew were almost like someone said, well, this guy likes this girl and this girl is mad.

566
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:52,959
Speaker 0: Like Nami's character might have been she punches people to show both anger and affection.

567
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:57,520
Speaker 0: I think that's the only direction they gave for her character in this movie.

568
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, quite possibly.

569
00:32:01,325 --> 00:32:02,339
Speaker 0: This movie was not.

570
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,120
Speaker 1: I suppose if you're already like a huge One Piece fan, right?

571
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:06,845
Speaker 0: It's not.

572
00:32:06,886 --> 00:32:08,160
Speaker 0: it's not a One Piece movie.

573
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:18,940
Speaker 1: Well, I'm saying I'm saying that if you are a huge One Piece fan, right, because the characters act in character, barely, you might, you know, they're in cardboard cutout character.

574
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:19,582
Speaker 1: Exactly.

575
00:32:19,623 --> 00:32:24,820
Speaker 1: But, you know, when people are huge fans of characters like that, they just get off on seeing those characters.

576
00:32:25,121 --> 00:32:26,320
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute.

577
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:29,200
Speaker 0: So this is American superhero comic syndrome.

578
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:30,243
Speaker 1: Possibly.

579
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:37,920
Speaker 0: I care about the events that happen around character with a proper noun A as long as they fit into the cardboard cutout.

580
00:32:37,981 --> 00:32:39,138
Speaker 0: That is proper noun A.

581
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,759
Speaker 1: Hey, people are all about that.

582
00:32:42,922 --> 00:32:43,640
Speaker 0: They are indeed.

583
00:32:44,985 --> 00:32:45,900
Speaker 0: I don't know what I could like.

584
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,100
Speaker 0: I would make fun of this movie, like go through the plot.

585
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:48,727
Speaker 0: Dave and Joel.

586
00:32:48,930 --> 00:32:49,235
Speaker 0: Let's see.

587
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:49,580
Speaker 0: All right.

588
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:50,780
Speaker 0: They land on the island.

589
00:32:51,101 --> 00:32:54,120
Speaker 0: They have a bunch of really stereotypical set up like we talked about.

590
00:32:54,800 --> 00:33:06,420
Speaker 0: This pirate captain surrounded by a bunch of people who all have leaves growing out of their heads in a fake town with Versailles and Moscow kind of inside of it.

591
00:33:06,802 --> 00:33:07,774
Speaker 0: And really bad CG.

592
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:09,970
Speaker 0: I don't know what was up with the CG.

593
00:33:10,010 --> 00:33:11,561
Speaker 0: It's 2005.

594
00:33:11,561 --> 00:33:12,254
Speaker 0: They couldn't get good CG.

595
00:33:13,701 --> 00:33:15,280
Speaker 0: But they have a contest.

596
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:19,260
Speaker 0: And the first contest is they've got to pick up a goldfish.

597
00:33:19,781 --> 00:33:21,900
Speaker 0: But the goldfish is gigantic.

598
00:33:22,565 --> 00:33:23,739
Speaker 0: And then they do it anyway.

599
00:33:24,261 --> 00:33:27,119
Speaker 0: And then they have another contest where they have to throw hoops on each other.

600
00:33:27,563 --> 00:33:29,660
Speaker 0: And then arrows come out and bullshit happens.

601
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:32,076
Speaker 0: Then an hour and fucking forever later, it's over.

602
00:33:33,121 --> 00:33:33,403
Speaker 1: The end.

603
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:34,326
Speaker 0: There's.

604
00:33:34,909 --> 00:33:40,059
Speaker 0: I defy anyone to enjoy this movie unless you are trying to analyze it.

605
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:41,420
Speaker 0: And even then, good luck.

606
00:33:41,501 --> 00:33:44,020
Speaker 0: Maybe if you really like memorials and you're trying to see his influence.

607
00:33:45,161 --> 00:33:48,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess he sort of, you know, it seems like he just did this as a job.

608
00:33:49,121 --> 00:33:49,362
Speaker 1: Right.

609
00:33:49,403 --> 00:33:52,380
Speaker 0: Rather than well, the animation was pretty different.

610
00:33:52,841 --> 00:34:00,300
Speaker 0: And especially some of the side characters he added, like look at the uncle who was a coward and those kids that was really hosted a feeling right there.

611
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:00,563
Speaker 1: Yeah.

612
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:01,820
Speaker 1: I mean, that is one thing I noticed.

613
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,400
Speaker 1: Watch the video we downloaded from the Internet.

614
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:04,641
Speaker 1: Right.

615
00:34:04,661 --> 00:34:08,020
Speaker 1: The encoding was not necessarily the highest.

616
00:34:08,341 --> 00:34:09,331
Speaker 0: The CG was bad, nonetheless.

617
00:34:09,371 --> 00:34:10,138
Speaker 0: Don't think that.

618
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:10,908
Speaker 1: Well, it's from 2005, right?

619
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:14,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was bad for 2005.

620
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:14,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

621
00:34:14,984 --> 00:34:16,980
Speaker 1: But the what was I saying?

622
00:34:17,100 --> 00:34:17,201
Speaker 1: Right.

623
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:23,257
Speaker 1: You look and I look even looking at with our batting code that made things kind of blurry because it was a download from the Internet's.

624
00:34:24,722 --> 00:34:26,860
Speaker 1: You know, it looked like things were a little off.

625
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:30,099
Speaker 1: I'm like, hey, those characters aren't looking like how they look.

626
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:32,079
Speaker 1: Usually it's a little bit off.

627
00:34:32,581 --> 00:34:38,699
Speaker 1: But according to the Internet's, it was, you know, this movie doesn't look like the other movies because Hosanna did that on purpose.

628
00:34:39,286 --> 00:34:40,559
Speaker 1: He made it look like his stuff.

629
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he couldn't stray too far from those characters.

630
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:51,940
Speaker 0: But obviously, so all his own characters like the normal people, Captain Hitler and all those guys, those other characters do not look.

631
00:34:52,300 --> 00:35:00,139
Speaker 1: But, you know, the characters that are new for this movie don't look very one piece ish except for maybe the bad guys, you know, and they only look a little bit one piece ish.

632
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:05,498
Speaker 1: And, you know, I don't think that the one piece guy actually designed these characters at all.

633
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:11,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that flower, every time it zoomed in on the flower, it was exactly like when it zoomed in on the smiling frog in Mipros Island.

634
00:35:13,442 --> 00:35:19,840
Speaker 0: Oh, so talking about a weird scene, there's a scene where basically Hitler is there.

635
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:20,920
Speaker 0: Actually, it's a pretty funny scene.

636
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,380
Speaker 0: Hitler's there and he's throwing rocks at Luffy.

637
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:31,360
Speaker 0: And for some reason, this scene goes on for like a couple of minutes where this guy just keeps throwing rocks at Luffy and Luffy can't see where they're coming from.

638
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:32,720
Speaker 0: And he keeps throwing bigger and bigger rocks.

639
00:35:33,262 --> 00:35:35,899
Speaker 0: And then he finally finds the guy and tries to confront him.

640
00:35:36,523 --> 00:35:43,460
Speaker 0: And then there's this weird scene where Luffy's like chasing the guy Scooby Doo style, and it just keeps going on and on.

641
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,740
Speaker 0: It is almost identical to a couple of scenes.

642
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:48,200
Speaker 0: It's really shit like pond movies.

643
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:49,739
Speaker 1: And then it finally ends.

644
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:53,120
Speaker 0: And there's the scene where Luffy's like standing there, there's out of a pool.

645
00:35:53,862 --> 00:36:00,479
Speaker 0: And the guy's talking and Luffy's talking and barely anything that either one of them saying really makes much sense.

646
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:03,098
Speaker 0: And then it just kind of ends.

647
00:36:04,422 --> 00:36:08,140
Speaker 0: And I guess the guy's captain of the mustache crew and he has a Hitler mustache.

648
00:36:08,961 --> 00:36:10,939
Speaker 0: But then there's another pirate crew somewhere else.

649
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,289
Speaker 0: They were the.

650
00:36:12,613 --> 00:36:13,038
Speaker 0: what were they?

651
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,839
Speaker 0: Because there's the mustache family.

652
00:36:15,221 --> 00:36:17,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were some other pirate crew, pirate family.

653
00:36:17,482 --> 00:36:19,140
Speaker 0: They were a modest pirate crew.

654
00:36:19,241 --> 00:36:20,018
Speaker 0: And they were the red.

655
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:23,040
Speaker 0: No, the red tails was the doesn't matter.

656
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:23,838
Speaker 0: So many pirate crews.

657
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:28,760
Speaker 1: And it's like, I don't think, you know, it's like, what does it even mean to be a pirate in this world?

658
00:36:28,881 --> 00:36:31,220
Speaker 1: It means you just have a you have friends.

659
00:36:31,502 --> 00:36:31,959
Speaker 1: You have a team.

660
00:36:32,141 --> 00:36:34,200
Speaker 1: You have a team on a boat that makes you pirates.

661
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,713
Speaker 1: It's like a guy.

662
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:37,160
Speaker 0: What do you pirate?

663
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:40,160
Speaker 0: I guess maybe that's why they're after the one piece.

664
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:41,640
Speaker 0: There was only one pirate ever.

665
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:43,279
Speaker 0: And he plundered and pillaged.

666
00:36:43,823 --> 00:36:45,598
Speaker 0: And he's got pirate booty and they want to get it.

667
00:36:46,081 --> 00:36:46,445
Speaker 0: Maybe.

668
00:36:46,566 --> 00:36:47,900
Speaker 0: And they don't realize how to get it.

669
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,279
Speaker 0: They're going after him to be pirates.

670
00:36:50,525 --> 00:36:54,420
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone but I don't have anything else to say about this movie.

671
00:36:54,802 --> 00:36:56,253
Speaker 0: No, I can't even make fun of it.

672
00:36:56,314 --> 00:36:57,100
Speaker 0: It's just weird.

673
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:00,219
Speaker 0: So I think this breaks my rule.

674
00:37:01,122 --> 00:37:07,120
Speaker 0: Usually whenever we review an anime movie, I always say there aren't that many anime movies.

675
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,460
Speaker 0: You might as well watch them all.

676
00:37:09,721 --> 00:37:11,740
Speaker 1: Well, no, that really just applies to.

677
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:15,479
Speaker 0: That applies to anime movies that are not sequels to other anime movies.

678
00:37:21,310 --> 00:37:23,450
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

679
