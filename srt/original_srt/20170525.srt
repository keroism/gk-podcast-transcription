1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,910
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, May 25th, 2017.

2
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,351
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:16,059
Speaker 1: I'm scared and this is geek nights tonight in another episode of.

4
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:20,768
Speaker 1: I can't believe we didn't talk about this before Talking about amusement parks.

5
00:00:21,009 --> 00:00:23,216
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we tell you to show me the episode.

6
00:00:23,898 --> 00:00:26,217
Speaker 1: find it Let's do this.

7
00:00:28,326 --> 00:00:35,940
Speaker 1: So tonight I don't care about hockey in a visceral level anymore because no team I care about is in contention for the cup.

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,745
Speaker 0: So on Pittsburgh to lose.

9
00:00:38,006 --> 00:00:39,289
Speaker 1: I do want Pittsburgh to lose.

10
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:44,665
Speaker 1: tonight's an important game because say the Senators in Pittsburgh It's gonna be a game seven.

11
00:00:44,886 --> 00:00:46,712
Speaker 1: One of them is gonna go on to fight the Preds.

12
00:00:47,234 --> 00:00:48,297
Speaker 1: The other one's gonna go home.

13
00:00:48,558 --> 00:00:54,756
Speaker 1: That's right and Really don't want a Pennsylvania team to ever win the Stanley Cup again if we can avoid it.

14
00:00:55,057 --> 00:00:58,539
Speaker 1: same with New Jersey Same with all but one New York team.

15
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:03,080
Speaker 0: But if the Sabres wanted to be funny, I guess no, whatever they could win out.

16
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:12,360
Speaker 1: But I think I'm rooting for the Preds and I'm hoping to see predators senators and Because neither one of them is my team NHL is not hoping for that.

17
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,627
Speaker 0: They're really their ratings will be.

18
00:01:14,290 --> 00:01:26,580
Speaker 1: but if it comes to that I'm hoping it goes into game seven and I'm hoping game seven has like 20 over times because Overtime hockey is one of the most stressful things in the world to watch if you care about the outcome of the game.

19
00:01:27,063 --> 00:01:29,759
Speaker 1: And it's one of the best things in the world to watch if you don't give a shit.

20
00:01:31,243 --> 00:01:39,828
Speaker 1: As long as you care about hockey in general at least I guess No, even if you don't care even if you don't even know what's going on Overtime game seven hockey is exciting.

21
00:01:39,968 --> 00:01:41,714
Speaker 1: Even if you literally don't know what's happening.

22
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:42,335
Speaker 1: Hmm.

23
00:01:43,058 --> 00:01:45,204
Speaker 1: So, uh, I got some news here.

24
00:01:45,264 --> 00:01:45,946
Speaker 1: You got some news.

25
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:46,568
Speaker 1: It's Thursday.

26
00:01:46,608 --> 00:01:49,057
Speaker 1: We can talk about whatever cuz it's the lounge.

27
00:01:49,077 --> 00:02:16,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's your mom And a sad news, so, you know way back in the college days, you know when we were in the a nine clubs Right, we listened to lots of j-pops and j-rocks and whatnot because that was the style of the times You know and especially like in the summer We would tend to play that music more often because it wasn't really the greatest winter music Even though winter was most of what we experienced in college because I'm in Rochester.

28
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,340
Speaker 1: Well, that was also, you know in that era like I became a weeb when I was in fourth grade.

29
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:27,220
Speaker 1: So I was already like I came to RIT already like mostly listening to like j-pop.

30
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:33,096
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I don't know how many people realize but there's a person named Ayumi Hamasaki.

31
00:02:33,136 --> 00:02:37,332
Speaker 0: He's basically sort of like The Madonna of Japan.

32
00:02:37,513 --> 00:02:50,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I remember as a kid I found for I found Megumi Hashibara because she did a lot of anime music and then at RIT I discovered Ayumi Hamasaki and she rapidly game one of my favorite music performers on earth, right?

33
00:02:51,801 --> 00:03:02,455
Speaker 0: Stuff is on Spotify and there's lots of like eurobeat remixes of her albums and stuff and she has like tons of hits and I Think it's you know, it's one of those names like every Japanese person will know who that is.

34
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:03,660
Speaker 0: I almost everyone, right?

35
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:06,782
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess someone who was just born wouldn't know Right.

36
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:11,840
Speaker 0: This is like a super famous person who hasn't really done anything recently, right?

37
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:14,040
Speaker 1: Or at least if she did I didn't pay attention like I didn't know.

38
00:03:14,462 --> 00:03:24,497
Speaker 0: But like every like, you know, maybe like once or twice a year every year Like I'm remembered that she exists usually in the summer You know and I go back in and I find something like a euro mix album or something.

39
00:03:24,517 --> 00:03:34,270
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh, yeah Kind of like how with Megumi Hashibara I remembered she existed because I was at Zenk icon and I did a panel on anime openers and We had a song that she sang on it.

40
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:36,180
Speaker 1: So I was like, oh right she exists.

41
00:03:36,461 --> 00:03:42,900
Speaker 0: But anyway, uh, but I like didn't know what she was up to recently until this news appeared in the news feeds.

42
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:47,580
Speaker 0: Right because this news appeared it linked out to all the other news's of what has happened to her, right?

43
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:49,719
Speaker 0: So the last I had heard from her was years ago.

44
00:03:50,322 --> 00:03:55,437
Speaker 0: She married like some guy from like California or something like some non-celebrity person.

45
00:03:55,457 --> 00:03:56,240
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, that's nice.

46
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:05,829
Speaker 0: So I kind of like it when like celebrity people like meet and marry non-celebrity people, you know Cuz it seems more like a. you know I hope that they have like a genuine thing going on.

47
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:18,998
Speaker 0: you tend to see lots of like mega celebrity people like Get married with each other and have like these Weddings that at least appear they might be legit, but they you know Appear that like they're just for show right there and then they you know divorce and get remarried like 20 times.

48
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:28,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, that's because it's you know, they're not like really, you know in a real relationship To like keep your circles in that same public sphere.

49
00:04:29,022 --> 00:04:32,273
Speaker 1: So you sort of limit your dating pool to people who are like that.

50
00:04:32,534 --> 00:04:38,519
Speaker 0: But anyway, but I heard you know One of the news's I saw is that that is no longer a thing which is kind of sad.

51
00:04:39,603 --> 00:04:48,280
Speaker 0: But the really sad news is that even though like she is a pop star and a singer She appears to be losing her hearing and she's not that old right now.

52
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,651
Speaker 1: Apparently that itself is not news know what?

53
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:56,959
Speaker 0: so what happened was is a long time ago actually, she had already been losing hearing in one ear right there was like an infection I think.

54
00:04:56,979 --> 00:05:24,200
Speaker 0: and But she was on tour and rather than like, you know, take a break and you know get some medical attention She's like, nope show must go on and ruined her ear and now the other ear is being ruined and it's like, you know we've had, you know, Beethoven was deaf too, right, but it's like You know I can't think of like someone who was a pop star like a huge such a huge one that then lost their hearing.

55
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:24,882
Speaker 1: Well, it's just.

56
00:05:25,223 --> 00:05:39,233
Speaker 1: it's extra sad in general whenever you see someone who is very good at a thing and a physical Disability comes along and prevents them from doing the thing that they love Like a hockey player gets the you know, one too many concussions and has to retire early.

57
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:41,460
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm any of those situations are always sad.

58
00:05:41,721 --> 00:05:43,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, so that's a thing.

59
00:05:44,271 --> 00:05:46,540
Speaker 1: Yep in a lighter news.

60
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,338
Speaker 1: So, you know that we go to pack south and pack south is a really good.

61
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:50,081
Speaker 1: packs Like.

62
00:05:50,743 --> 00:05:58,125
Speaker 1: if you have to pick one packs and you can't afford to go to like packs west pack south is way Cheaper and nicer than

63
00:05:58,727 --> 00:06:07,720
Speaker 0: even if you live far away from pack south at least if you live in the United States Pack south, even if you live in New York pack south will probably be cheaper than packs east.

64
00:06:07,981 --> 00:06:12,015
Speaker 0: You know if you live in like Massachusetts pack south is probably shockingly cheap.

65
00:06:12,116 --> 00:06:13,220
Speaker 1: food cost nothing there.

66
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:18,357
Speaker 0: Flights and hotel will probably cost less than the parking in Boston.

67
00:06:18,658 --> 00:06:23,153
Speaker 0: Yep Okay, and so you're gonna and then the ticket.

68
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,720
Speaker 0: you're gonna be able to get it very easily.

69
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,089
Speaker 1: Just buy it on the website at face value.

70
00:06:27,651 --> 00:06:29,859
Speaker 1: It's like hotels like a hundred and twenty bucks a night.

71
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:37,417
Speaker 0: Right, you're only gonna be disappointed in like and you know pack south If you're one of those people who just wants to be in the expo hall playing triple-a games.

72
00:06:37,477 --> 00:06:39,424
Speaker 0: in which case Please stop going to pack.

73
00:06:39,444 --> 00:06:44,380
Speaker 1: So from my perspective the expo hall at pack south is kind of better than the one in paxies.

74
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's less crowded.

75
00:06:45,845 --> 00:06:52,679
Speaker 1: Let's go the weird like lower tier games of people who can't afford to be at a bigger packs Which is usually the more interesting games.

76
00:06:53,704 --> 00:06:58,045
Speaker 0: And also there is some trip place that remember the last pack south Frickin.

77
00:06:58,206 --> 00:07:00,460
Speaker 0: Nintendo was there with the stretch and shit, right?

78
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:01,041
Speaker 0: You know.

79
00:07:01,462 --> 00:07:07,020
Speaker 1: and peck south was until packs unplugged got announced the most tabletop in packs.

80
00:07:07,665 --> 00:07:08,996
Speaker 1: For a lot of reasons it ended.

81
00:07:09,016 --> 00:07:09,480
Speaker 1: so it's great.

82
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,649
Speaker 1: But I think we talked about this.

83
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:18,760
Speaker 1: but when we went to San Antonio for the for pack south We got trapped there for extra days because of a blizzard back in the north.

84
00:07:19,585 --> 00:07:21,920
Speaker 1: So we saw the fuck out of the Alamo.

85
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,063
Speaker 0: Yeah There is nothing.

86
00:07:23,103 --> 00:07:27,180
Speaker 0: there is no tourist thing to do in San Antonio that we have not dude.

87
00:07:27,663 --> 00:07:29,720
Speaker 0: So there's no reason for me to stay there any longer than this.

88
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:34,740
Speaker 1: We've said that we literally we went to the Alamo and spent hours there because there's nothing else to do.

89
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,147
Speaker 1: So we read every piece of text Everywhere in the entire facility.

90
00:07:39,387 --> 00:07:42,397
Speaker 1: we sat in every little park all around it.

91
00:07:42,417 --> 00:07:50,811
Speaker 1: So Apparently said the Alamo made it on this list as The worst tourist trap in Texas.

92
00:07:50,851 --> 00:07:53,100
Speaker 0: who made this list under what I don't even know or care?

93
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,259
Speaker 0: Is this just some BuzzFeed list or is it like a real list?

94
00:07:56,760 --> 00:07:59,880
Speaker 0: Wso ctv.com I guess some local TV network?

95
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:11,220
Speaker 1: yeah, but that that's not news because the reality is the Alamo might be in terms of Expectation versus reality the second worst tourist trap in all of America.

96
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,377
Speaker 0: I mean the Alamo is not it's it.

97
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,340
Speaker 0: I mean I my expectations were low but I can understand how people's expectations can be high because it's mythos.

98
00:08:19,662 --> 00:08:21,559
Speaker 1: You've seen that Davy Crockett, right?

99
00:08:22,382 --> 00:08:23,730
Speaker 0: of the Alamo.

100
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:28,829
Speaker 0: the legend of the Alamo is Larger than the reality which is it?

101
00:08:28,909 --> 00:08:36,073
Speaker 1: just sort of this building and it's not In some ruins and it's like there's just strip malls next to it.

102
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,557
Speaker 0: now, it's half gift shop.

103
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:46,598
Speaker 0: Yep You'll probably have more fun if you're a tourist like with a family doing like the Ripley's believe it or not garbage across the street yep, uh.

104
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:56,860
Speaker 1: So I think the only tourist trap in all of America that has a bigger disparity between the average person's Expectation and the reality of it is Mount Rushmore.

105
00:08:57,503 --> 00:08:58,730
Speaker 0: Fuck Mount Rushmore.

106
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,756
Speaker 0: What's wrong with Mount Rushmore?

107
00:08:59,836 --> 00:09:00,439
Speaker 1: You ever been to it?

108
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,201
Speaker 0: No, why?

109
00:09:01,282 --> 00:09:05,757
Speaker 1: if the thing with around much Mount Rushmore people treat it like it's something you should go see right?

110
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:06,640
Speaker 0: is that never been?

111
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,382
Speaker 1: There I know better.

112
00:09:07,543 --> 00:09:08,927
Speaker 0: is it's which?

113
00:09:09,088 --> 00:09:10,332
Speaker 0: it's in South Dakota, right?

114
00:09:10,874 --> 00:09:12,820
Speaker 1: It's it's in the middle of nowhere, right?

115
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,264
Speaker 0: Is it nothing you're gonna?

116
00:09:14,305 --> 00:09:17,154
Speaker 0: you're gonna go to this place in the middle of fucking.

117
00:09:17,195 --> 00:09:18,760
Speaker 0: no meaning that it is your desk.

118
00:09:19,184 --> 00:09:20,275
Speaker 0: There's nothing else.

119
00:09:20,375 --> 00:09:24,230
Speaker 0: there Is a bunch of faces on a rock.

120
00:09:24,290 --> 00:09:27,960
Speaker 1: there's nothing to do there and the faces aren't even that great.

121
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,587
Speaker 0: There's nothing around it.

122
00:09:29,808 --> 00:09:30,270
Speaker 0: It's just.

123
00:09:30,552 --> 00:09:31,255
Speaker 1: but think about this.

124
00:09:31,616 --> 00:09:36,994
Speaker 1: if Mount Rushmore We're like at some exit on your way to a real place.

125
00:09:37,295 --> 00:09:38,178
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a five-minute.

126
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:38,860
Speaker 0: Check it out worth.

127
00:09:39,162 --> 00:09:41,200
Speaker 1: It's going like oh look at that then keep going.

128
00:09:41,522 --> 00:09:44,760
Speaker 1: But the fact that you would have to make your entire trip around going to it.

129
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:47,331
Speaker 0: At least the Alamo there's like you can walk around.

130
00:09:47,372 --> 00:09:50,122
Speaker 0: so it's like a museum a tiny crappy one But a museum.

131
00:09:50,143 --> 00:09:51,105
Speaker 0: there's something in there.

132
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:56,460
Speaker 0: Mount Rushmore is like is a bunch of rocks of four president's heads that someone made by dynamite.

133
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,505
Speaker 0: And here they are.

134
00:09:57,526 --> 00:10:00,099
Speaker 0: but you look at them for a few minutes and then you're good.

135
00:10:00,421 --> 00:10:03,534
Speaker 1: San Antonio is weird because I've been going there every year.

136
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:04,840
Speaker 1: now like I'm gonna keep going to that packs.

137
00:10:04,981 --> 00:10:11,720
Speaker 1: I love it, but a Lot of people especially families seem to go to San Antonio as a tourist destination.

138
00:10:11,861 --> 00:10:14,491
Speaker 0: Well, I mean if you live nearby, right if it's.

139
00:10:14,611 --> 00:10:16,077
Speaker 0: if it's you know, there's a lot of land.

140
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:18,186
Speaker 1: No, these are these people are?

141
00:10:18,206 --> 00:10:20,860
Speaker 1: it's not like they live nearby and they come in and like go out like day trip.

142
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:25,660
Speaker 1: These are people like come and stay for days in hotels and go around the city.

143
00:10:26,386 --> 00:10:32,340
Speaker 1: It's a two-day town And that's if you go like out of your way to like the museum's right.

144
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:40,275
Speaker 0: So the best part about this article the other thing you had to understand though Is that and we're sure definitely gonna talk about this in the main part of the show.

145
00:10:40,396 --> 00:10:41,420
Speaker 0: Is that you know?

146
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,406
Speaker 0: He who travels alone travels fastest.

147
00:10:44,968 --> 00:10:47,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like so we're and we're too fast people.

148
00:10:47,475 --> 00:10:49,340
Speaker 0: So even together we're really we're pretty fast.

149
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:52,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're faster than a lot of one people's traveling.

150
00:10:52,802 --> 00:10:57,300
Speaker 0: Right, so but when you're with a family traveling with the children, yeah, that's hella slow.

151
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,718
Speaker 1: So like a two-day town grandma doesn't want to go see the thing and mom's picky about it.

152
00:11:01,778 --> 00:11:03,985
Speaker 0: at the rest You know the mother tie Alamo.

153
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:11,645
Speaker 0: that takes you and me one hour to see everything is gonna take a family all fucking day but San Antonio is.

154
00:11:12,026 --> 00:11:16,740
Speaker 1: so the best part about this is not necessarily that you know article.

155
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:27,102
Speaker 1: It's the FARC thread associated with it of people talking about Texas San Antonio and Tourism because basically everyone there is the exact same opinion We do.

156
00:11:27,404 --> 00:11:33,517
Speaker 1: the river walks nice and there's this Tower of America's thing I guess you can go on top of and this comment here.

157
00:11:33,537 --> 00:11:37,796
Speaker 1: Yes Let's climb to the top of this building so we can see all the highways and Walmart parking lots.

158
00:11:37,936 --> 00:11:38,760
Speaker 0: That's what we saw.

159
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:48,410
Speaker 1: Yep The only interesting thing we saw up there at all other than the awesome mysterious industrial facility far away Yep out in the desert couldn't even tell what it was.

160
00:11:48,451 --> 00:11:50,160
Speaker 1: There's some sort of factory looking thing.

161
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:53,571
Speaker 1: We spent like 10 minutes like trying to figure out what it was and that was cool.

162
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:54,093
Speaker 1: Mmm.

163
00:11:54,555 --> 00:11:56,140
Speaker 1: It's just San Antonio.

164
00:11:57,061 --> 00:12:03,328
Speaker 1: People go to this place as a tourist destination Mm-hmm, and I really just don't get it.

165
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:08,300
Speaker 1: and you can enjoy this FARC thread of people comparing even people who come to New York.

166
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:08,842
Speaker 0: What do they do?

167
00:12:09,143 --> 00:12:10,569
Speaker 0: They go look at the Statue of Liberty?

168
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:11,050
Speaker 0: Yes.

169
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:13,600
Speaker 0: What's the difference between the Statue of Liberty and Mount Rushmore?

170
00:12:13,681 --> 00:12:24,100
Speaker 0: it was made by French people and Statue of Liberty is next to like 4,000 other things you can do of a similar caliber, right but those tourists they don't go to Ellis Island, right?

171
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,726
Speaker 0: You know, they're doing stupid shit.

172
00:12:25,746 --> 00:12:27,151
Speaker 1: They don't even go to Governor's Island.

173
00:12:27,332 --> 00:12:29,320
Speaker 0: Like they don't know the Governor's Island exists.

174
00:12:29,441 --> 00:12:38,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, like if you're a tourist coming in here, it's like they just go whoa tall buildings and they buy stuff They go to stores and some of the coolest things you can do in New York are just like ride the East River ferry.

175
00:12:38,821 --> 00:12:40,251
Speaker 1: It cost like a dollar.

176
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:41,561
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it cost 275.

177
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,471
Speaker 0: Well, I mean if you're a tourist you can ride the circle line.

178
00:12:43,492 --> 00:12:44,940
Speaker 0: the circle line is actually not bad.

179
00:12:45,121 --> 00:12:49,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's like it's a one one of the few things you can do as a tourist.

180
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:53,938
Speaker 0: That's not bad Yep, but like you can live in New York and I can just go ride the circle line tomorrow.

181
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:54,400
Speaker 0: That's a good time.

182
00:12:54,863 --> 00:13:02,219
Speaker 1: Ah someone pointed out you can see the Alamo from top there Which you can and that really puts in the stark contrast that the Alamo is not a thing anymore.

183
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:11,120
Speaker 1: Also the the last stand of the Alamo was a bunch of jerks who were basically fighting to preserve slavery.

184
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,886
Speaker 1: so Mm-hmm.

185
00:13:13,150 --> 00:13:17,440
Speaker 1: Yeah In some other news, I got a little bit of a geek bite.

186
00:13:18,043 --> 00:13:24,014
Speaker 1: So I know I'm late to the party on this but I on my flight back from Hong Kong I watched a bunch of episodes of Westworld.

187
00:13:24,034 --> 00:13:28,518
Speaker 0: Oh The you'll Brenner TV show doesn't have you a Brenner in it.

188
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,417
Speaker 1: No Well, yeah, you think of it as a year-old Brenner TV show, but it's Michael Crichton.

189
00:13:32,738 --> 00:13:33,020
Speaker 1: Really?

190
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:38,498
Speaker 1: You're just obsessed with your Brenner, which I can understand why An attractive man.

191
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:42,811
Speaker 1: But Westworld I actually watched a bunch of it.

192
00:13:42,831 --> 00:13:46,585
Speaker 1: now Emily and I are watching it together to watch it all the way to the End season one is done.

193
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:47,788
Speaker 1: It's only ten episodes.

194
00:13:48,551 --> 00:13:49,614
Speaker 1: So it's pretty short to watch.

195
00:13:50,376 --> 00:14:02,099
Speaker 1: It's real good and The best way I describe it is if you like say Jurassic Park or that episode of The Simpsons Where they go to itchy and scratchy land.

196
00:14:02,902 --> 00:14:08,480
Speaker 1: Both of those things are actually more referencing or based on Westworld than based on anything else.

197
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,513
Speaker 1: You might think they're based on who I mean.

198
00:14:10,694 --> 00:14:11,479
Speaker 0: who didn't know that?

199
00:14:11,721 --> 00:14:17,060
Speaker 1: Most people think that itchy and scotchy episode is based solely on Jurassic Park and have no idea that Michael Crichton also made Westworld.

200
00:14:18,003 --> 00:14:20,303
Speaker 1: Okay, people don't know this stuff I've discovered.

201
00:14:20,865 --> 00:14:30,796
Speaker 1: but Westworld like the TV Westworld is Jurassic Park with robots instead of dinosaurs Except it gets a lot more into like cyberpunk Ghost in the Shell nonsense.

202
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,808
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm and the new TV series.

203
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:44,132
Speaker 1: it takes the premise of Westworld and Kind of minimizes the action thriller like cowboy robot shooting each other And it really focused.

204
00:14:44,212 --> 00:14:45,220
Speaker 1: It's just Ghost in the Shell.

205
00:14:46,441 --> 00:14:52,539
Speaker 1: It's Ghost in the Shell nonsense and it's really really really good in so far as I've seen the first third of it.

206
00:14:53,302 --> 00:14:54,386
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna watch.

207
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:55,250
Speaker 0: it's ten episodes.

208
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:56,073
Speaker 0: You only seen three.

209
00:14:56,093 --> 00:14:57,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you're on a flight from Hong Kong.

210
00:14:57,921 --> 00:15:03,128
Speaker 1: That's enough time to watch like 30 because I also So that flight to Hong Kong from Hong Kong.

211
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:04,653
Speaker 1: I slept for half of it.

212
00:15:04,954 --> 00:15:16,087
Speaker 1: Okay, and the other half I mostly went around collecting bits to upgrade the Hylian clothing all the way to the max and Went around collecting thing.

213
00:15:16,147 --> 00:15:19,056
Speaker 1: I basically got my hundred ancient arrows turned out.

214
00:15:19,076 --> 00:15:21,817
Speaker 1: I only needed like 10 to be gannin.

215
00:15:22,201 --> 00:15:28,634
Speaker 1: So yeah I was not just watching Westworld and in fact I was watching the fourth episode and then the flight was about to land.

216
00:15:28,674 --> 00:15:29,860
Speaker 1: so I didn't see the end of that episode.

217
00:15:30,921 --> 00:15:32,389
Speaker 1: But it's real good.

218
00:15:33,134 --> 00:15:38,500
Speaker 1: And if you're into Existential Turing test like what does it mean to be conscious?

219
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:40,226
Speaker 1: Cyberpunk nonsense.

220
00:15:40,949 --> 00:15:47,200
Speaker 1: It's real good, but it is real violence and real disturbing.

221
00:15:48,201 --> 00:15:48,302
Speaker 0: Hmm.

222
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:50,592
Speaker 0: I mean the original Westworld movie was disturbing.

223
00:15:50,733 --> 00:15:57,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, but in a more Because of the tech this the special effects capabilities of the day.

224
00:15:57,275 --> 00:15:58,600
Speaker 1: it's a little more over the top.

225
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:00,099
Speaker 0: So it's each of the killer disturbing.

226
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:01,966
Speaker 1: This one is more.

227
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:03,170
Speaker 1: you know each of the killer like.

228
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:11,499
Speaker 1: the main part of its violence was that the camera wouldn't cut away And you'd see like three more seconds of that knife cutting across before it would snap back.

229
00:16:12,143 --> 00:16:15,060
Speaker 1: Westworld is very hyper realistic violence.

230
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,491
Speaker 0: I heard something about someone was like gonna like remaster.

231
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:19,975
Speaker 0: each of the killer like HD.

232
00:16:20,016 --> 00:16:27,205
Speaker 1: each of the killers, you know I don't know if I really want to see that because You see the killer like.

233
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:28,530
Speaker 1: I like that movie.

234
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,603
Speaker 1: what I made in the in the sense My only.

235
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:47,603
Speaker 0: really the only thing good about that movie is that if you it's one of those movies where you can You know watch it when it's super late at night and like you're really really tired It's got that sort of Nighttime mood sort of the same sort of same mood as Space Ghost has when you watch it at like, you know 2 a.m It's like

236
00:16:47,724 --> 00:16:47,825
Speaker 1: it's.

237
00:16:47,966 --> 00:16:49,660
Speaker 1: also it's much like apocalypse zero.

238
00:16:49,740 --> 00:17:02,480
Speaker 1: It's one of those media experiences where it may not necessarily be good and I may have been disturbed by it But I remember it and it was an experience that I'm glad I had even if I don't necessarily want to replicate that experience.

239
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:14,900
Speaker 1: West world has moments that approach that level of violence, but unlike each of the killer they are coupled with actual Emotions and characters and plots you care about as opposed to something that makes no sense.

240
00:17:15,101 --> 00:17:15,402
Speaker 0: Yeah,

241
00:17:15,683 --> 00:17:34,098
Speaker 1: I mean the hypnotist like each of the killer really Really does not end the way you probably all think it does Because all those people that Oda kind of walked out before the end They didn't get to see that muscle hypo hypnotism moment Which is I think that might be in my top five of scenes and movies I've ever seen

242
00:17:34,118 --> 00:17:34,580
Speaker 0: right?

243
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:39,680
Speaker 1: Because I did not know how to react to what was happening on screen at that moment in that movie.

244
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:44,855
Speaker 0: That doesn't make it top five Makes it I think is in my top five though top five of things.

245
00:17:44,895 --> 00:17:45,899
Speaker 0: I didn't know how to react to.

246
00:17:45,959 --> 00:17:46,120
Speaker 0: sure.

247
00:17:46,301 --> 00:17:48,732
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, it made me sit up and go.

248
00:17:48,772 --> 00:17:49,013
Speaker 1: Wait.

249
00:17:49,214 --> 00:17:50,439
Speaker 1: What's this movie about again?

250
00:17:52,262 --> 00:17:58,760
Speaker 1: A bit of the ultra violence, but yeah Westworld is super good so far as I've seen and it's only ten episodes.

251
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:03,556
Speaker 1: So you might as well just watch it and it's real easy to see it whether or not you pay for it.

252
00:18:04,077 --> 00:18:06,704
Speaker 1: Just saying Got any other news.

253
00:18:06,744 --> 00:18:07,166
Speaker 1: Is that it?

254
00:18:07,989 --> 00:18:08,351
Speaker 1: We're good.

255
00:18:08,552 --> 00:18:25,775
Speaker 1: then I guess it's time for Things of the day says, you know Another thing I've watched the scout doesn't watch is it's always sunny in Philadelphia Which kind of scratches that the itch that Seinfeld would scratch?

256
00:18:25,815 --> 00:18:30,450
Speaker 1: except Seinfeld does not Largely live up to modern comedic sensibilities.

257
00:18:31,092 --> 00:18:35,151
Speaker 1: Seinfeld was more revolutionary for its time But I wouldn't necessarily recommend people go back and watch it.

258
00:18:36,116 --> 00:18:36,780
Speaker 1: It's always sunny.

259
00:18:36,881 --> 00:18:39,439
Speaker 1: It's just it kind of scratches that itch now and I really like it.

260
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:41,259
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna review it right now.

261
00:18:42,222 --> 00:18:47,436
Speaker 1: My thing of the day is a super cut of all the intros to all the episodes of.

262
00:18:47,497 --> 00:19:03,260
Speaker 1: it's always sunny in Philadelphia because the open the intros to these episodes have a very particular theme and style and way they come together and shotgunning all of them in this 11-minute video is Pretty entertaining even if you don't actually know what the show is about.

263
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:05,819
Speaker 1: So what do you got for me?

264
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:09,152
Speaker 0: Alright, so here's an old old old issue of.

265
00:19:09,173 --> 00:19:38,520
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's the village voice But it could be just voice but it's from like October 1986 and the article is favorite dinosaurs of The Mets as in the New York Mets who play baseball and I'm not sure if the author Charlie Rubin spelled exactly the same as my last name related to me Actually went and Interviewed the Mets to get these answers or if this is a complete work of fiction, but it does not matter.

266
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,330
Speaker 1: Nope, the mythos is all that matters.

267
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,320
Speaker 0: He answered it in the character of the various players.

268
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:46,390
Speaker 0: So it's as if they answered the question.

269
00:19:46,531 --> 00:19:47,314
Speaker 1: Mookie Wilson.

270
00:19:47,696 --> 00:19:55,979
Speaker 1: when I'm in a slum I comfort myself by saying if I believe in dinosaurs then somewhere they must be real They must be believing in me.

271
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:56,984
Speaker 1: It must be something I could.

272
00:19:57,045 --> 00:20:00,140
Speaker 0: it was cut off in my and if they believe in me then I can believe in me.

273
00:20:00,403 --> 00:20:01,155
Speaker 0: Then I bust out.

274
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:04,026
Speaker 0: Yep, right, so it's like.

275
00:20:04,408 --> 00:20:08,340
Speaker 0: is basically he asked, you know each met real or fiction?

276
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:14,500
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if you know if you actually asked them, but these have to be fictional because they're Rafael Santana.

277
00:20:14,902 --> 00:20:24,397
Speaker 1: I know two things the best ball players in the world come from San Pedro de Macau Ris in the Dominican Republic and the best petrosaurus come from terrace or terrace.

278
00:20:24,417 --> 00:20:25,240
Speaker 1: those come from Kansas.

279
00:20:25,601 --> 00:20:29,277
Speaker 1: Kansas is the San Pedro de Macau Ris of flying shit.

280
00:20:29,338 --> 00:20:29,759
Speaker 0: That's right.

281
00:20:31,701 --> 00:20:40,640
Speaker 0: There's an excellent article from olden days and I think you know, it makes you think and realize like, you know Every day or consuming, you know so much internets, right?

282
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:48,400
Speaker 0: I read so much internets every day But I'm only reading things that are like brand new that day like instantly even if something's five minutes old.

283
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:53,620
Speaker 0: It's too old not reading it right, but there was already so much content created in the past.

284
00:20:53,740 --> 00:21:05,200
Speaker 0: Most of it you could ignore, you know, like you don't need to read a newspaper article from like, you know About some local townie happening in the 80s or whatever right, but you know a lot of things like this.

285
00:21:05,401 --> 00:21:19,440
Speaker 0: You know, I've been in magazines and you know Newspapers and all sorts of other print medias, you know things that like aren't even like like saved likely like programs to various Events and things, you know, they're school newspapers.

286
00:21:20,782 --> 00:21:22,970
Speaker 0: You know some things some kid made somewhere.

287
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:23,652
Speaker 0: Well, you know what.

288
00:21:23,672 --> 00:21:33,329
Speaker 0: so there's a ton of great content out there That's really inaccessible or is hidden in libraries and unless someone takes a photo of it and puts it on internet You're not gonna see it.

289
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:39,113
Speaker 1: So when I was in middle school I was there because they were busting me over to the high school to take mostly high school classes.

290
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:50,371
Speaker 1: I didn't have enough Actual classes in the middle school to take so the school put me in this sort of like work program where I worked For the school's library.

291
00:21:50,733 --> 00:21:55,300
Speaker 1: So for an hour and a half a day I just sit in the library and I guess shelve books but there wasn't enough work to do.

292
00:21:55,380 --> 00:22:02,486
Speaker 1: so what I did is I would they had an archive a physical archive of Every issue of popular science and popular mechanics.

293
00:22:03,288 --> 00:22:03,950
Speaker 1: I read all of them.

294
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:06,657
Speaker 0: every single one covered cover.

295
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:07,760
Speaker 1: I'm not covered a couple.

296
00:22:07,982 --> 00:22:08,426
Speaker 1: Well, I'm based.

297
00:22:08,466 --> 00:22:15,802
Speaker 1: I take each one out what every day I just take a pile of them and I flipped through each one like look at every page and see if there's anything interesting and I'd Would get.

298
00:22:15,862 --> 00:22:17,414
Speaker 1: I'd get through like 30 of them a day.

299
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:20,769
Speaker 1: And that's what I did in middle school.

300
00:22:20,789 --> 00:22:21,633
Speaker 0: That's a lot of time.

301
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:22,859
Speaker 1: What else was it gonna do?

302
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:23,970
Speaker 1: They wouldn't let me play.

303
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:26,510
Speaker 1: my gameboy Wasn't allowed to do that.

304
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:30,110
Speaker 1: Uh Modern like there's no smartphone.

305
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:31,740
Speaker 1: It's not like I could sit and look at the internet.

306
00:22:31,821 --> 00:22:32,427
Speaker 1: What was I gonna do?

307
00:22:32,448 --> 00:22:33,519
Speaker 1: I looked at the physical internet.

308
00:22:34,861 --> 00:22:39,739
Speaker 1: So in the moment, the book club book is Frank Herbert's Dune and because I beat Gannon, I'm gonna read it soon.

309
00:22:42,645 --> 00:22:43,339
Speaker 1: Just be Gannon.

310
00:22:44,501 --> 00:22:45,970
Speaker 1: You guys just go kill Gannon right now.

311
00:22:45,990 --> 00:22:47,840
Speaker 0: I have even gone to Goron land.

312
00:22:48,681 --> 00:22:49,083
Speaker 1: Oh, you can.

313
00:22:49,103 --> 00:22:50,127
Speaker 1: you could kill Gannon right now.

314
00:22:50,188 --> 00:22:51,493
Speaker 1: In fact without going to Goron land.

315
00:22:51,514 --> 00:22:52,217
Speaker 1: It might be more fun.

316
00:22:52,598 --> 00:23:04,985
Speaker 1: Probably Goron land is way easy and boring You really I'm really really sad that I did Goron land last cuz it's the weakest of the four Mmm, like the plot is boring The characters are boring the.

317
00:23:05,386 --> 00:23:10,982
Speaker 1: the shrine is either the shrine the beast is easy and the quest to get to the beast is also Really easy.

318
00:23:11,443 --> 00:23:16,697
Speaker 0: I didn't do any of the house buying stuff or yeah the dragon scale getting I got.

319
00:23:16,777 --> 00:23:18,747
Speaker 1: I did to the dragon scales I didn't care anymore.

320
00:23:18,787 --> 00:23:19,574
Speaker 0: I only got one.

321
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:20,300
Speaker 0: I gave the other two.

322
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:26,260
Speaker 1: I was trying to farm the dragons to upgrade my champion shirt cuz that's the only way to see actual hit points of enemies.

323
00:23:26,381 --> 00:23:28,372
Speaker 1: But I just wore my like Zora suit.

324
00:23:28,392 --> 00:23:28,975
Speaker 1: It didn't matter.

325
00:23:28,995 --> 00:23:29,518
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

326
00:23:30,401 --> 00:23:34,420
Speaker 1: So yeah, otherwise, you should check out my youtube channel and Scott's youtube channel.

327
00:23:35,024 --> 00:23:44,123
Speaker 1: This episode of geek nights is live streaming right now on YouTube And if you follow my youtube channel most episodes of geek nights just live stream and there are 11 people watching it right now And they're actually.

328
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:46,793
Speaker 1: they're having a great big old chat in there right now.

329
00:23:46,974 --> 00:23:48,660
Speaker 0: They should not do that.

330
00:23:48,821 --> 00:23:50,089
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's something better to do.

331
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,142
Speaker 1: Well, they're literally like just like chatting There's like.

332
00:23:52,162 --> 00:24:00,040
Speaker 0: I mean look, you know while I haven't seen it and I can't personally recommend it Wouldn't you be better off going to watch that Westworld the room was just talking about than watching geek nights?

333
00:24:00,181 --> 00:24:01,428
Speaker 0: You are better off what it.

334
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,278
Speaker 0: wouldn't that be a better use of your time?

335
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:19,103
Speaker 1: Even watching the old you you'll Brenner Westworld is definitely a better use of time than watching geek nights though I don't let anyone spoil Westworld for you Like if you don't know what the deal is with Westworld don't go look it up like the old Westworld Robots.

336
00:24:19,685 --> 00:24:24,240
Speaker 1: watch this robot people, you know, it's funny cuz this wasn't planned cuz robot cowboy.

337
00:24:24,401 --> 00:24:28,080
Speaker 1: We didn't know what we were doing the show on until like just when we started recording.

338
00:24:28,582 --> 00:24:36,960
Speaker 1: but we're doing the show on amusement parks and it just so happens that half of our Topics ended up being about amusement parks there heads that we had to have done a show to use in parks.

339
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:37,925
Speaker 0: I couldn't find one.

340
00:24:37,965 --> 00:24:38,448
Speaker 0: No way.

341
00:24:38,468 --> 00:24:40,620
Speaker 0: This is like one of rims top five favorite things to talk.

342
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:46,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like what I was gonna talk about on NTP heuristics the fixed protocol.

343
00:24:50,198 --> 00:24:52,560
Speaker 0: I Will be not done a show in all of rims favorite things already.

344
00:24:52,942 --> 00:24:56,578
Speaker 0: I mean I sir you could search yourself, but I'm sure we did shows on all of Scott's favorite things.

345
00:24:56,598 --> 00:25:01,140
Speaker 0: learning Yeah, but I this I mean did we even do a show on the fixed protocol?

346
00:25:02,141 --> 00:25:02,826
Speaker 0: Don't worry about it.

347
00:25:02,947 --> 00:25:04,176
Speaker 1: We could do a show on the fixed protocol.

348
00:25:04,196 --> 00:25:04,377
Speaker 0: It's not.

349
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:07,591
Speaker 1: You're better off watching Westworld than listen to me.

350
00:25:07,611 --> 00:25:08,777
Speaker 1: Talk about the fixed protocol.

351
00:25:08,837 --> 00:25:09,400
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

352
00:25:11,123 --> 00:25:21,713
Speaker 1: So I have a complicated Relationship with amusement parks because on one hand I Grew up in a place where I could go to Cedar Point Which is literally the best roller coaster park in the world bar none.

353
00:25:21,753 --> 00:25:28,719
Speaker 1: Like there is not even a question It's not the best amusement park by any stretch, but it is definitely the best roller coaster park.

354
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:46,720
Speaker 1: But growing up like near that and like literally going to Cedar Point multiple times a summer every summer It was a big part of my childhood and roller coasters actually were a big hobby of mine like learning about them and like learning About how I knew how to see your point and amusement parks get run.

355
00:25:47,501 --> 00:25:50,511
Speaker 1: But at the same time I'm gonna see you playing a rollercoaster tycoon.

356
00:25:51,454 --> 00:25:53,280
Speaker 1: I did a lot just not recently.

357
00:25:54,781 --> 00:26:07,016
Speaker 1: But well, the problem with roller coaster tycoon is that it's not accurate at all much like playing striking Uh The same rib bone twice and yet making tudes entirely distinct sounds.

358
00:26:07,398 --> 00:26:07,899
Speaker 0: Why don't you?

359
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:11,227
Speaker 0: Make roller coaster like simulator.

360
00:26:11,247 --> 00:26:13,153
Speaker 0: that's accurate like the farm simulator and such.

361
00:26:13,814 --> 00:26:14,496
Speaker 1: Ah, you know what?

362
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:18,438
Speaker 1: I wonder if that exists anyway, I will look that up.

363
00:26:18,579 --> 00:26:26,908
Speaker 1: but amusement parks outside of Cedar Point Always feel weirdly Sad and cheap to me.

364
00:26:27,089 --> 00:26:31,184
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's just that when I was young, you know Cuz like kid brain.

365
00:26:31,525 --> 00:26:32,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just kid brain, right?

366
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,780
Speaker 0: It's like even like when you're in San Antonio, right?

367
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:39,620
Speaker 0: We saw those like believe it or not sitting haunted houses and shit across the street from the Alamo.

368
00:26:40,148 --> 00:26:49,332
Speaker 0: And when I was a kid I went to those things and when I passed by them say in Niagara Falls or New Hampshire or any other kind of touristy Place like George I'd be like, ooh, I want to go in there.

369
00:26:49,352 --> 00:26:50,035
Speaker 0: That looks cool.

370
00:26:50,476 --> 00:26:52,310
Speaker 1: Not only does exist It's called no limits.

371
00:26:52,673 --> 00:26:57,576
Speaker 1: It has a sequel It also works with VR and it's like ultra physics engine.

372
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:58,400
Speaker 1: It looks like sure.

373
00:26:59,222 --> 00:27:03,978
Speaker 0: But now when I see those my adult eyeballs like oh wow, those look really sad and run down and crappy.

374
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,915
Speaker 0: Yep, I do think though some aspect of that rundown this?

375
00:27:10,216 --> 00:27:10,798
Speaker 0: I'm not 100% sure on this.

376
00:27:11,721 --> 00:27:14,620
Speaker 0: I'd need like video or phone was less rundown when you were younger fertile.

377
00:27:14,768 --> 00:27:15,542
Speaker 0: Yeah Is that?

378
00:27:15,622 --> 00:27:22,529
Speaker 0: I think like my memory is like in the 90s it seemed like there was like some economic Explosion where there was tons of money.

379
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:25,100
Speaker 1: well case in point malls, right animatronics.

380
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:36,086
Speaker 0: You would go to malls and like the Disney Store would be like some crazy Experience full of animatronics shit and they'd be like a VR thing and that'd be like a you know NASCAR simulator thing.

381
00:27:36,126 --> 00:27:37,831
Speaker 0: and there'd be a laser tag in the mall.

382
00:27:37,851 --> 00:27:41,823
Speaker 1: and then the mall in my house had a water park Inside of it.

383
00:27:41,923 --> 00:27:46,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there were water slides that wound their way around the mall that had glass walls.

384
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:49,829
Speaker 0: You could see people going by things like battle tech pods, right?

385
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:53,200
Speaker 0: But now as time went on, you know, those things weren't upgraded.

386
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:59,564
Speaker 0: They were run down shuttered, you know destroyed sold Disappear owed.

387
00:27:59,584 --> 00:28:02,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's got dirty and janky.

388
00:28:02,173 --> 00:28:04,140
Speaker 0: They were not maintained.

389
00:28:05,043 --> 00:28:05,284
Speaker 0: so it's

390
00:28:05,324 --> 00:28:26,869
Speaker 1: interesting because you know I by going to the same amusement park year after year after year and By not only was I a nerd about amusement like Cedar Point and roller coasters But my family was too like the coffee table book in our living room for a long time was this gigantic hardcover like in-depth history of Cedar Point Like that stuff.

391
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:27,712
Speaker 1: so like.

392
00:28:27,752 --> 00:28:39,859
Speaker 1: I knew a lot about the history and the park was way more rundown when I was younger and then it got an infusion of money and was like way cleaned up and got way better and Then I got kind of crappy to run down again.

393
00:28:40,342 --> 00:28:47,009
Speaker 1: and then they like super rebrand and got rid of all the Berenstain Bears dust and replaced it with like Ultra commercialized Snoopy nonsense.

394
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:47,993
Speaker 0: I like Snoopy.

395
00:28:48,214 --> 00:28:57,371
Speaker 0: I like Snoopy a lot better than Berenstain Bears Yeah, but the Berenstain Bears thing was like this barely commercialized like science center And I thought Berenstain Bears is religious.

396
00:28:57,552 --> 00:28:59,320
Speaker 0: or is that just something I'm remembering incorrectly?

397
00:28:59,621 --> 00:29:07,548
Speaker 1: I feel like it was adjacent to that, but I don't think it was directly that I remember just being Inoffensive and lame and really like gender-rolly.

398
00:29:07,568 --> 00:29:11,160
Speaker 0: I was not a fan of Berenstain Bears when other kids were reading it in like first grade.

399
00:29:11,401 --> 00:29:16,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, well because by first grade you're already a little too old for the Berenstain Bears not some of the kids in my class.

400
00:29:18,168 --> 00:29:28,499
Speaker 1: I remember in my elementary school in fifth grade They gave the four smart kids in class my side of the mountain to read and they gave all the other kids in class the biography of Michael Jordan.

401
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:30,986
Speaker 0: I've read a biography of Michael Jordan.

402
00:29:31,167 --> 00:29:44,513
Speaker 0: Yeah for fun because they figured that the the rest of the class When I read a biography of Michael Jordan, he was still playing Yeah But uh, he hadn't even played baseball yet at the time.

403
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:45,880
Speaker 1: so amusement park.

404
00:29:45,920 --> 00:29:49,420
Speaker 1: So it's weird too because amusement parks are like fake by design.

405
00:29:50,063 --> 00:30:03,466
Speaker 1: but at least for like nerds like us it's almost more interesting to Embrace the fakeness to me and like really try to look around the corners Look at the things you're not supposed to look at and like check out the back end and like see what's going on in that Parking lot.

406
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:07,386
Speaker 0: I was always doing that but yeah You know that you could still write the.

407
00:30:07,466 --> 00:30:11,257
Speaker 0: the front sides of things were, you know, pristine mostly, right?

408
00:30:11,758 --> 00:30:22,280
Speaker 0: So like The amusement park I went to most when we were young was the one that they would take us to on trips whether you know in the Geographically, you know situated right which is called Riverside.

409
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:27,279
Speaker 0: I had this raccoon mascot and then what happened is the years went on.

410
00:30:27,641 --> 00:30:31,712
Speaker 0: Eventually Riverside got bought by Six Flags and it's now Six Flags New England.

411
00:30:31,732 --> 00:30:33,437
Speaker 0: and when Six Flags New England bought it.

412
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:38,379
Speaker 0: they started Adding and replacing and adding and replacing, right?

413
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,067
Speaker 0: So there's like still like.

414
00:30:40,690 --> 00:30:48,427
Speaker 0: if I go there I can still point out like ah That's from Riverside that you know, there's like this this area in the middle It can is still Riverside.

415
00:30:48,468 --> 00:30:55,999
Speaker 0: basically, even though it's not hasn't been called that in forever And everything else that's like out, you know, it's all brand new stuff.

416
00:30:57,061 --> 00:30:58,366
Speaker 0: So that's where I went the most.

417
00:30:58,446 --> 00:31:00,915
Speaker 0: but like also you'd be there like summer camp and you could like.

418
00:31:00,935 --> 00:31:04,812
Speaker 0: I think I went to Dorney Wants and Hershey Lake Compounce.

419
00:31:05,375 --> 00:31:07,284
Speaker 0: Yeah the the ambulance I went there was.

420
00:31:07,304 --> 00:31:13,425
Speaker 1: I just learned from Wikipedia that Lake Compounce is the oldest Continuously operating amusement park in North America.

421
00:31:13,465 --> 00:31:19,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, Lake Compounce actually originally was sort of like this just like Lake with like bungalows.

422
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:20,966
Speaker 1: Well, so it's contemporary to Cedar Point.

423
00:31:20,986 --> 00:31:25,060
Speaker 1: Cedar Point started the same way in the 1800s as like a lake resort on Lake Erie.

424
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:32,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, just like a resort like rich people would go there and hang out and have a good time and then eventually You know slowly they added rides to it at some point, right?

425
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,620
Speaker 0: Yeah Became a natural place to put that sort of thing and then that became the bigger attraction than the original.

426
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,780
Speaker 0: It's like if you owned a roller skating rink and you put in a pac-man machine and suddenly everyone's playing pac-man and no one's roller skating.

427
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:46,880
Speaker 0: Eventually you get rid of the roller skating and just fill it up.

428
00:31:48,064 --> 00:31:50,293
Speaker 1: As a kid, I used to go to roller rinks a lot.

429
00:31:50,895 --> 00:31:52,240
Speaker 1: There were a bunch of them in my town.

430
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:59,674
Speaker 0: There's only one in our town and it I think some years it like burned down multiple times And now it's actually gone.

431
00:31:59,714 --> 00:32:00,319
Speaker 0: now for reals.

432
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:06,327
Speaker 1: I think they used to run these all-night parties where you'd go there all night and just like Rollerblade and hang out in the arcade mostly.

433
00:32:06,347 --> 00:32:08,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, we went you know, there were many birthday parties there.

434
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:21,729
Speaker 1: Yeah but yeah, like all these old amusement parks like eventually started like adding rides bit by bit and becoming like real places and Disney is probably the first like modern amusement park.

435
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:24,136
Speaker 0: I want to say well Disney's a theme park, right?

436
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,440
Speaker 0: It's not really well true.

437
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:28,772
Speaker 1: There's a theme other than just there are amusement, right?

438
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:29,113
Speaker 0: There's like.

439
00:32:29,133 --> 00:32:29,434
Speaker 0: there's like.

440
00:32:29,655 --> 00:32:31,080
Speaker 0: it's like a few different tiers, right?

441
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:37,828
Speaker 0: The first tier is the portable one that like comes to your town Arnie's the carny one, right as a kid We'd whenever the carny's were in town.

442
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:39,053
Speaker 1: I always wanted to go over there.

443
00:32:39,134 --> 00:32:40,680
Speaker 1: My parents are like, no, they're in a store.

444
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,075
Speaker 0: Oh, they were in a story like last week.

445
00:32:42,156 --> 00:32:44,645
Speaker 1: Yeah Like yeah, that's a kid brain.

446
00:32:45,047 --> 00:32:45,648
Speaker 1: There's rides.

447
00:32:45,709 --> 00:32:46,531
Speaker 1: I want to ride them.

448
00:32:46,752 --> 00:32:48,859
Speaker 1: I don't give a fuck about how safe they are.

449
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,547
Speaker 0: And those rides are safe.

450
00:32:50,848 --> 00:32:52,275
Speaker 0: Yeah, the tiny ones.

451
00:32:52,436 --> 00:32:54,774
Speaker 1: Yeah They're not that safe.

452
00:32:54,976 --> 00:32:55,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're good.

453
00:32:55,782 --> 00:33:02,436
Speaker 1: I saw someone get seriously injured on one when I was a kid Sure, and I was on one that broke down and other people got hurt.

454
00:33:02,496 --> 00:33:03,300
Speaker 1: I was actually okay.

455
00:33:03,761 --> 00:33:09,980
Speaker 1: But I I saw one the chain that like drove the spinner snapped and flew out into the crowd.

456
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:15,673
Speaker 1: It didn't hit anyone but it hit a tree and like embedded inside of it Yeah, nice like that would have killed whoever it hit.

457
00:33:15,693 --> 00:33:16,720
Speaker 0: I'll be on YouTube today.

458
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,113
Speaker 1: Yeah, the funny thing is if you're on that ride, it would have been safer.

459
00:33:20,133 --> 00:33:22,708
Speaker 1: Yeah, I rode one once We were in luck.

460
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:35,160
Speaker 1: We went to like a Michigan State Fair and they the carnies set up these rides and there's this one ride that was manually controlled Like it wasn't just like hit a button to start hit him on the stop.

461
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:47,594
Speaker 1: the guy was like moving this throttle constantly and like looking at gauges and My parents started talking to the car and he was like, yeah this thing's actually illegal in most of the country because it's super fucking dangerous and like.

462
00:33:47,634 --> 00:33:51,672
Speaker 1: I could really hurt people if I mess up and It's fun so fast.

463
00:33:51,713 --> 00:33:53,532
Speaker 1: I couldn't breathe Nice.

464
00:33:53,716 --> 00:34:08,539
Speaker 1: Yeah like literally start spinning and my brother and I like faster faster and the guys like like he gives us his thumb up and then He's basically it's a spinner and then around it are Sub-spinners and the cars are on the end of those sub spinners.

465
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:15,739
Speaker 1: So if the sub spinner was spinning in the same direction as the main spinner, you literally could not breathe And I never wrote that thing.

466
00:34:17,201 --> 00:34:22,980
Speaker 0: So the next tier up is sort of like the established in one place amusement park, but not a big one, right?

467
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:26,333
Speaker 0: So in Connecticut, there's like quasi is the one we went to.

468
00:34:26,474 --> 00:34:28,581
Speaker 0: there's also one in New Hampshire That was like.

469
00:34:29,185 --> 00:34:31,833
Speaker 0: it was sort of like an old timey town.

470
00:34:31,853 --> 00:34:33,559
Speaker 0: I forget what it was called, but it had like.

471
00:34:34,981 --> 00:34:40,318
Speaker 0: It had a like one of those houses where you sit in it in the room turns around you and a train ride.

472
00:34:42,882 --> 00:34:48,500
Speaker 0: You know, it's just like it didn't even have a one roller coaster, you know, but it's like an established place with some rides.

473
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:52,847
Speaker 0: But you know, it doesn't It's not really large.

474
00:34:52,867 --> 00:34:58,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then there's the full-on theme parks The ones like people follow the world or at least all over the region will go to.

475
00:34:58,637 --> 00:35:01,840
Speaker 0: well There's even stuff in between that though, right?

476
00:35:01,940 --> 00:35:13,120
Speaker 0: It's like, you know the six flat, you know like six flags kind of places are in between the small places in the Few roller coasters and like a bunch of like basic thrill rides.

477
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:17,284
Speaker 0: Right and this even with though even with the six flags level of thing There's all.

478
00:35:17,405 --> 00:35:19,640
Speaker 0: there's almost sort of like two levels of that, right?

479
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:23,679
Speaker 0: There's some six flags that are like tiny and there's some that are like the mega.

480
00:35:24,302 --> 00:35:25,105
Speaker 0: No, we're the.

481
00:35:25,266 --> 00:35:30,057
Speaker 0: we're this crazy six flags and we're sort of like yeah, we're just a six flags We're like one of the crappy ones.

482
00:35:30,743 --> 00:35:38,570
Speaker 1: So as a kid, it was weird because I would like like my family like, you know We're talking about fast like we're fast movers when it comes to travel Like we see the whole Alamo and like we've seen everything.

483
00:35:39,213 --> 00:35:41,222
Speaker 1: we were like that at amusement parks anywhere We went.

484
00:35:41,463 --> 00:35:54,754
Speaker 1: we'd like study the map in advance and like we're gonna ride this ride first and we're gonna like You're gonna eat in line and not waste time be there when the park opens you leave after the park closes Like we were puff puff puff go go go 100% Even when I was a little kid

485
00:35:55,783 --> 00:36:03,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the difference was is like, you know, I think Probably me one who was willing to ride more rides than anyone else in the family.

486
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:14,719
Speaker 0: You know see my whole family was like down with the roller coaster, yeah Yeah, and it wasn't like we were gonna like split up in some crazy crowded place when we were all children's.

487
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

488
00:36:15,503 --> 00:36:22,672
Speaker 0: So it's like we just sort of you know, we weren't slow, you know We're definitely faster than some others, but we were not the fastest right.

489
00:36:22,752 --> 00:36:35,259
Speaker 0: and you know, depending on the place, you know you know how long lines or whatever, but I never felt like We missed out on like there was never a time where there's something I wanted to go on that we didn't go on.

490
00:36:35,340 --> 00:36:41,808
Speaker 1: no No, it's like dinner point was just so big and it's so many coasters that you regularly would not ride Like you could not ride every ride there in one day.

491
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:43,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's literally no way.

492
00:36:43,094 --> 00:36:50,260
Speaker 0: the other the other good times though We're like when we went with like summer camp or something You just sort of like be on your own or with a couple camp friends.

493
00:36:50,381 --> 00:36:52,843
Speaker 1: those are those early forays into Independence.

494
00:36:52,923 --> 00:36:57,783
Speaker 0: or you'd go with school and you just be like with a couple of your school friends and then you just run around Everything.

495
00:36:58,084 --> 00:36:59,351
Speaker 1: that was so my high school.

496
00:36:59,391 --> 00:37:01,180
Speaker 1: the physics classes would always do like physics day.

497
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:04,800
Speaker 1: We're like y'all go to Cedar Point and you have to do some experiments and the rides.

498
00:37:06,044 --> 00:37:06,888
Speaker 0: We didn't do any of that.

499
00:37:06,948 --> 00:37:08,594
Speaker 0: We just said we're going to be used in parking.

500
00:37:08,614 --> 00:37:09,055
Speaker 0: There was no.

501
00:37:09,076 --> 00:37:12,906
Speaker 0: there was no Justification other than school trip.

502
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:13,348
Speaker 0: Let's go.

503
00:37:13,528 --> 00:37:16,280
Speaker 1: So when I took the day I turned 16 was in January.

504
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,358
Speaker 1: so like I got a car and I could drive that was crazy.

505
00:37:18,379 --> 00:37:24,700
Speaker 1: and that summer When I was 16, I had this revelation like I was in school one day.

506
00:37:25,101 --> 00:37:32,407
Speaker 1: It was like near early June like school's gonna be out soon and I just suddenly realized wait a minute I could just drive my car to Cedar Point.

507
00:37:32,427 --> 00:37:34,034
Speaker 1: I could just go there.

508
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:35,560
Speaker 1: Who's gonna stop me?

509
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:36,371
Speaker 1: I can do whatever the hell I want.

510
00:37:36,392 --> 00:37:36,859
Speaker 1: I have a car.

511
00:37:37,402 --> 00:37:39,992
Speaker 1: So the next day me and a bunch of furniture skip school and she went to Cedar Point.

512
00:37:40,253 --> 00:37:44,302
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and that was great Being.

513
00:37:44,322 --> 00:37:53,580
Speaker 1: that was like being alone in amusement parks as a kid without your slow parents slowing you down Was one of the like the highlights of my childhood, but now I haven't been to one in a long time.

514
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:57,223
Speaker 1: But I'm feeling that itch like real strong Man, I mean like.

515
00:37:57,284 --> 00:37:59,029
Speaker 1: I'm not feeling the amusement park.

516
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:02,140
Speaker 1: itch like I don't want to go see shows in an amusement park.

517
00:38:02,501 --> 00:38:04,852
Speaker 1: I don't even want to go to the arcade in an amusement park.

518
00:38:05,314 --> 00:38:06,740
Speaker 1: I just want to ride a roller coaster.

519
00:38:07,643 --> 00:38:11,447
Speaker 1: I'm feeling the roller coaster itch Independent of any theme parking.

520
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:12,390
Speaker 0: that is true, right?

521
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:15,560
Speaker 0: Cuz it like in those days right in the 90s or whatever, right?

522
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,684
Speaker 0: We didn't have no YouTube.

523
00:38:16,724 --> 00:38:20,939
Speaker 0: So like the show at an amusement park was like like whoa, holy crap.

524
00:38:20,999 --> 00:38:24,320
Speaker 0: now It's like you can see those things on the internet and they're not that exciting.

525
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:27,591
Speaker 0: The arcades of the amusement park it used to be.

526
00:38:27,611 --> 00:38:29,260
Speaker 0: you'd go there and they'd like some games there.

527
00:38:29,260 --> 00:38:30,160
Speaker 0: It's like holy shit.

528
00:38:30,662 --> 00:38:35,642
Speaker 0: Even it with the time we were in college like early 2000s you go to reason parking at DDR and it's like oh my god Did your machine?

529
00:38:35,662 --> 00:38:38,512
Speaker 1: Yes, the Cedar Point was the first place I ever saw a physical DDR.

530
00:38:38,552 --> 00:38:39,134
Speaker 0: It was always.

531
00:38:39,154 --> 00:38:45,479
Speaker 0: it was always upsetting that the Arcades adding amusement parks cost like four times as much as the ones in your town.

532
00:38:46,022 --> 00:38:51,040
Speaker 0: But they always had like for some reason new the newest bestest fanciest games there.

533
00:38:51,422 --> 00:38:52,466
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's still there.

534
00:38:52,828 --> 00:39:04,300
Speaker 1: Cedar Point at least when I was a kid had a bunch of modern arcades, but they had one Giant arcade like, you know, it's other than fun spot, which is just mostly an arcade.

535
00:39:04,340 --> 00:39:13,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, the place that I went with the second biggest arcade was actually of all places Sesame Place in Pennsylvania, I don't know if it's still there.

536
00:39:13,927 --> 00:39:18,740
Speaker 0: I mean it's Sesame Place is still there But I don't know at least I think it is but I don't know if the arcade is still there.

537
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:28,020
Speaker 0: The arcade at Sesame Place was like two stories tall as I remember it right and in one part They had all these custom Sesame Place computers.

538
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:32,180
Speaker 0: Whoa, they were like Apple twos with simpler keyboard kind of things going on.

539
00:39:32,401 --> 00:39:33,265
Speaker 0: I can't remember.

540
00:39:33,285 --> 00:39:34,972
Speaker 0: maybe you search your Sesame Place computer.

541
00:39:34,992 --> 00:39:35,515
Speaker 0: You'll see one.

542
00:39:35,535 --> 00:39:36,720
Speaker 1: I think it's gone.

543
00:39:37,101 --> 00:39:43,720
Speaker 0: Anyway, and it had these like Sesame Street games on them and you could choose from among the games.

544
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,206
Speaker 0: They're all like kid games, right?

545
00:39:45,347 --> 00:39:50,486
Speaker 0: Because it's Sesame Place, but those games were not available Like anywhere else ever.

546
00:39:50,566 --> 00:39:51,469
Speaker 0: it was like the only place.

547
00:39:51,489 --> 00:39:55,240
Speaker 0: you could play those ABC games at those computers at Sesame Place.

548
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,286
Speaker 0: But that wasn't the whole arcade.

549
00:39:57,586 --> 00:40:05,559
Speaker 0: the rest of the arcade was a two-story big-ass room regular old arcade And I played like Simpsons arcade game there.

550
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:11,940
Speaker 1: The biggest one was obviously not retro on purpose to like make money from being retro.

551
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:15,460
Speaker 1: It was just they put all the old shitty games and like this one giant arcade.

552
00:40:15,981 --> 00:40:22,320
Speaker 1: But that giant arcade was nothing but like a retro arcade museum effectively and the games in there were only a quarter.

553
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:30,733
Speaker 1: Well a token they didn't take quarters and the arcade games and the normal arcades cost normal money Like put a dollar in there to play your Simpsons or whatever.

554
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:32,060
Speaker 0: Sesame Place still exists.

555
00:40:32,141 --> 00:40:41,596
Speaker 1: Let's see if this Sesame Place arcade still exists Because it looks like a lot of the games that were in the retro arcade at Cedar Point are not there anymore based on some tentative interneting.

556
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:47,760
Speaker 1: But as an adult if I want to play retro arcade games, I could just go to magfest.

557
00:40:48,223 --> 00:41:09,639
Speaker 1: So if I go back to Cedar Point, which I'm really thinking about doing this summer I think I'm just going to ride roller coasters and literally do nothing else in that park And I think part of why I got amusement park out of my system like independent of a roller coaster was that I was just Recently in Disney for the first time as an adult and I think I amusement parked out in the course of that trip.

558
00:41:11,961 --> 00:41:13,470
Speaker 1: I'm just killing time while you look up your thing.

559
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:14,193
Speaker 1: Have you looked it up yet?

560
00:41:14,214 --> 00:41:15,400
Speaker 1: Do I have to keep killing time?

561
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,171
Speaker 0: I don't know if they still have an arcade there.

562
00:41:17,211 --> 00:41:18,460
Speaker 0: It's not clear from their website.

563
00:41:18,661 --> 00:41:21,551
Speaker 0: No, I want to find a picture of those old computers though.

564
00:41:22,093 --> 00:41:24,000
Speaker 0: So how cool would it be to get one of those computers?

565
00:41:24,221 --> 00:41:27,354
Speaker 1: Yeah, so in terms of that's the kind of thing you bring to magfest.

566
00:41:27,836 --> 00:41:28,398
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right?

567
00:41:28,438 --> 00:41:30,787
Speaker 1: Yeah We got to get on that.

568
00:41:30,848 --> 00:41:32,640
Speaker 1: see if we can find someone who will like bring it to magfest.

569
00:41:33,286 --> 00:41:34,074
Speaker 0: I found a picture of it.

570
00:41:35,742 --> 00:41:38,881
Speaker 1: So in terms of amusement parks like as a kid What?

571
00:41:38,921 --> 00:41:40,045
Speaker 1: what were your favorite rides?

572
00:41:40,145 --> 00:41:42,533
Speaker 1: and has that changed as an adult as a channel?

573
00:41:42,594 --> 00:41:44,460
Speaker 0: I haven't ridden rides in a long time.

574
00:41:44,581 --> 00:41:52,080
Speaker 1: I think the last ride we rode was both of us Remember when I had Lyme disease and Wildwood and we both paid the like $14 to ride that one roller coaster.

575
00:41:52,821 --> 00:41:56,392
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I don't really have a like a favorite kind of right.

576
00:41:56,432 --> 00:41:59,140
Speaker 1: maybe what kinds of rod like throw up forget roller coasters.

577
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,124
Speaker 1: How about just throw rides?

578
00:42:00,526 --> 00:42:01,791
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, so I'm saying it's like this.

579
00:42:02,052 --> 00:42:04,000
Speaker 0: It's pretty much as good ride or bad ride, right?

580
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:07,256
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like if there's a roller coaster that's all shaky.

581
00:42:07,297 --> 00:42:07,920
Speaker 0: It makes you sick.

582
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,108
Speaker 0: It's no good, but it is a roller coaster.

583
00:42:10,148 --> 00:42:12,176
Speaker 0: That's like whoo, then it's good.

584
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:22,269
Speaker 1: You know, it's like mmm, but when you don't care like inversions or like partial inversions or hanging or I mean You know this good inversions and bad inversions.

585
00:42:22,429 --> 00:42:28,172
Speaker 0: now hanging ones that are good and bad and you know It's like there's definitely there's no particular category.

586
00:42:28,232 --> 00:42:29,919
Speaker 0: That's like better or worse, right one.

587
00:42:30,321 --> 00:42:37,400
Speaker 1: Yes, cuz I because I you know, I was a nerd about this I think about it in turn like they're sort of legit industry categories for all those different kinds of thrill rides.

588
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:39,659
Speaker 1: So I can categorize them much more easily.

589
00:42:40,762 --> 00:42:42,672
Speaker 1: But that technology definitely changed like when I was a kid.

590
00:42:43,155 --> 00:42:44,160
Speaker 1: there was this inversion ride.

591
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:49,160
Speaker 1: There was just a wheel like a ferris wheel that started sideways and then it would slowly rise to be vertical.

592
00:42:49,521 --> 00:42:54,338
Speaker 1: So you're just going upside down upside down upside down upside down and it would make some people real sick.

593
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:56,145
Speaker 0: Yeah That's a good ride.

594
00:42:56,647 --> 00:43:04,080
Speaker 1: But that was like that era similar to the roundup Yeah, but in that era that was like the height of like full inversion thrill ride.

595
00:43:04,662 --> 00:43:10,183
Speaker 1: But I remember just as I was getting ready to go to college like a few years before that when I was in high school Cedar Point.

596
00:43:10,203 --> 00:43:10,905
Speaker 1: they kept the witch's wheel.

597
00:43:10,925 --> 00:43:15,180
Speaker 1: that was like a retro ride and they added this other ride called chaos.

598
00:43:16,383 --> 00:43:20,054
Speaker 1: It moved in so many axes that you could like it was.

599
00:43:20,515 --> 00:43:28,790
Speaker 1: it was insane how disorienting that ride was and you could see like this moment where Thrill ride like design and technology started to.

600
00:43:29,171 --> 00:43:33,614
Speaker 1: I guess use data or get more advanced or maybe material science Like allowed them to do crazier things.

601
00:43:36,423 --> 00:43:42,673
Speaker 1: But uh You know I kind of only liked thrill rides as a kid because you couldn't.

602
00:43:42,713 --> 00:43:48,592
Speaker 1: you literally could not just ride roller coasters all day Or you might get sick or get a headache and the lines were long.

603
00:43:48,672 --> 00:43:53,090
Speaker 1: So thrill rides were just like Many not roller coasters.

604
00:43:53,111 --> 00:43:55,903
Speaker 1: you'd ride between roller coasters Like.

605
00:43:55,923 --> 00:44:00,100
Speaker 1: I would never ride a thrill ride unless I was on my way to ride a real roller coaster.

606
00:44:01,861 --> 00:44:02,063
Speaker 0: Mmm.

607
00:44:02,669 --> 00:44:10,186
Speaker 1: and in terms of roller coasters I pretty much primarily like the mega coasters like the out-and-back like Super giant hills super fast.

608
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:17,487
Speaker 1: big drop like that was my favorite bar none like the Magnum or the millennium 4 And I was just happy to be riding a ride right?

609
00:44:17,527 --> 00:44:23,285
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you're going whoo pretty much matter what ride it is You know It's better than not riding a ride.

610
00:44:23,326 --> 00:44:26,100
Speaker 1: wait in line has ever been a ride that like messed you up or you didn't go.

611
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:31,731
Speaker 0: Woo, like it was bad news when I was super small Super small, right?

612
00:44:32,092 --> 00:44:36,463
Speaker 0: So again sesame place There was it.

613
00:44:36,583 --> 00:44:38,029
Speaker 0: there's a water ride there.

614
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:40,779
Speaker 0: it's actually called the counts car wash and the count is my guy.

615
00:44:41,201 --> 00:44:44,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know the counter guy other than you know, Cookie Monster, right?

616
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:47,553
Speaker 0: And the counts car wash is basically sort of like.

617
00:44:47,874 --> 00:44:49,120
Speaker 0: I'm sure you could find pictures of it.

618
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:58,040
Speaker 1: It's basically like, you know tubes you crawl around in like, you know mesh net - oh They had one of those on the roof of the ball pit building when I was a kid.

619
00:44:58,181 --> 00:45:01,656
Speaker 0: yeah, you know and it sprays water on you all the time, right.

620
00:45:02,179 --> 00:45:09,970
Speaker 0: but You know the second time I went to sesame place, you know I had this memory of the first time I went there.

621
00:45:10,071 --> 00:45:18,380
Speaker 0: and the memory I had of the first time I went there Was not, you know when I looked at it I saw like you're just being sprayed with water everywhere, right?

622
00:45:18,480 --> 00:45:27,756
Speaker 0: It wasn't like any big deal, but my memory was that it was basically Cylinders and tubes and you know pieces that were 100% filled with water.

623
00:45:30,543 --> 00:45:30,824
Speaker 0: And like.

624
00:45:30,844 --> 00:45:37,992
Speaker 0: I had this fake memory obviously fake memory of like, you know, basically being trapped in these tubes Yeah, completely submerged.

625
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:39,500
Speaker 1: I had all these memories.

626
00:45:40,522 --> 00:45:46,039
Speaker 0: Like I was like I was inside a clear but filled in submarine trying to swim out.

627
00:45:46,661 --> 00:45:51,940
Speaker 0: I had all I was not, you know, I had a severe negative memory associated with the counts car wash.

628
00:45:52,761 --> 00:45:55,473
Speaker 0: Now when I look at it, it's like whatever it's.

629
00:45:55,834 --> 00:45:57,200
Speaker 1: I had all these weird fake memory.

630
00:45:57,281 --> 00:45:59,039
Speaker 0: I guess I went on it when I was too young.

631
00:45:59,562 --> 00:46:03,398
Speaker 1: It created a false thing cuz there was like the giant tube thing.

632
00:46:03,438 --> 00:46:03,920
Speaker 1: It wasn't water.

633
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,051
Speaker 1: It was just like on the roof of this building versus John.

634
00:46:06,372 --> 00:46:16,730
Speaker 1: as far as I remembered as a kid It was a structure so large and so complex that I was pretty sure there were kids who just lived inside of it And like had never found their way out.

635
00:46:17,252 --> 00:46:20,158
Speaker 1: and when I saw it as a teenager I went up there and looked at it.

636
00:46:20,902 --> 00:46:21,845
Speaker 1: I was taller than it.

637
00:46:22,347 --> 00:46:26,105
Speaker 1: and yet I remember it towering above me to the point that I never thought I'd see the top of it.

638
00:46:27,221 --> 00:46:30,940
Speaker 1: Perspective of how high your eyeline is actually changes those situations a lot.

639
00:46:31,587 --> 00:46:35,268
Speaker 1: But the only ride that ever messed me up I think was so see your point added.

640
00:46:35,288 --> 00:46:41,140
Speaker 1: because they started doing like the different kinds of coasters and They made a new kind of coaster one year called the Mantis.

641
00:46:41,561 --> 00:46:43,085
Speaker 1: It was a standing coaster.

642
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:48,400
Speaker 1: you stand on a platform and there's a fuck up harness that comes over your shoulders.

643
00:46:48,861 --> 00:46:57,252
Speaker 1: But you stand and they're like vertically and the ride goes and there's a little platform that kind of comes up Like almost like a bicycle seat.

644
00:46:57,272 --> 00:47:02,460
Speaker 1: you're not supposed to sit on it But it like is there to keep you from falling down out of the roller coaster.

645
00:47:03,182 --> 00:47:24,760
Speaker 1: so the first so I. I waited in line for like three hours to ride the thing cuz it was a new ride never was Lined up for it and I finally get on it and I go and the bicycle seat thing Stayed a little too high and crushed my balls and I spent the entire ride desperately trying to not get my balls Completely crushed at the bottom of every hill and it was a nightmare.

646
00:47:26,781 --> 00:47:33,546
Speaker 1: It's very telling that they since got rid of that roller coaster and they rebuilt it to be a different format of coaster is no Standing coaster.

647
00:47:33,908 --> 00:47:36,140
Speaker 0: so I can't find a picture of the counts carwash.

648
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:39,759
Speaker 0: it's apparently been replaced with the counts splash castle.

649
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:46,178
Speaker 0: and Looking at a picture of the splash castle like wow, that thing is actually fucking awesome looking.

650
00:47:46,198 --> 00:47:50,451
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah They read they renamed it the Rougarou and it's flawless.

651
00:47:50,712 --> 00:47:53,380
Speaker 1: instead of floor that literally tries to crush rims balls.

652
00:47:53,782 --> 00:47:55,388
Speaker 1: Okay, so a good job.

653
00:47:55,769 --> 00:48:01,794
Speaker 1: I think that was the only bad roller coaster I ever rode other than oh Well, I when I was a kiddo there was a quasi.

654
00:48:02,115 --> 00:48:20,958
Speaker 0: there was like a. we rode like this tiny tiny roller coaster where there's only two people in the car like a little cat and mouse dealing and It's one of those ones, you know goes up and then it sort of makes all like these sharp turns like you're going perfectly straight Like there isn't any elevation changing and it'll make like a 90-degree turn a 90-degree turn and return.

655
00:48:21,661 --> 00:48:24,430
Speaker 0: It's just like uh, uh, uh, and it's a wooden and crappy.

656
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,120
Speaker 0: and click click click click click and it's really uncomfortable.

657
00:48:27,281 --> 00:48:35,780
Speaker 0: Then it'll go down a little bit and it's like yeah, and it's just sort of someone like beating the shit out of you Right, like shaking your body around in random directions.

658
00:48:35,940 --> 00:48:37,687
Speaker 1: That's what it was like for me with the old cuz.

659
00:48:37,968 --> 00:48:41,380
Speaker 1: I like old wooden coasters for like history and aesthetics.

660
00:48:42,063 --> 00:48:45,799
Speaker 1: But actually riding one of those things is just a guaranteed migraine headache.

661
00:48:45,819 --> 00:48:48,580
Speaker 0: for the rest I mean, they're good wooden ones and bad wooden ones.

662
00:48:49,003 --> 00:48:58,694
Speaker 1: Most of the ones you think of as good wooden ones are technically steel Possibly if they're smooth if the track if the tracks are round steel tubes It doesn't matter if the whole thing is made out of wood.

663
00:48:58,735 --> 00:48:59,620
Speaker 1: That is a steel coast.

664
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:00,563
Speaker 0: No, the tracks are.

665
00:49:00,684 --> 00:49:02,631
Speaker 1: there's still lots of metal.

666
00:49:02,651 --> 00:49:03,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, the rails right.

667
00:49:03,635 --> 00:49:05,060
Speaker 0: so I get a Busch Gardens.

668
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:12,520
Speaker 0: There's one where it's like this Uh, it's it's wooden and there's two roller coaster to sort of go at the same time a red one and a blue one.

669
00:49:12,962 --> 00:49:16,220
Speaker 1: There's one of those in Cedar Point called Gemini, but it's a steel coaster, right?

670
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:20,197
Speaker 0: But it's like a lion tiger deal or something because Busch Gardens has you know animal theme.

671
00:49:20,237 --> 00:49:23,171
Speaker 0: Yeah, right But it's like it's.

672
00:49:23,211 --> 00:49:26,760
Speaker 0: definitely they're on rails But it was you know at the time I went on it.

673
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,313
Speaker 0: It was like it was modern and smooth and kind of nice to ride.

674
00:49:29,353 --> 00:49:32,163
Speaker 0: It wasn't like, you know What's the?

675
00:49:32,203 --> 00:49:33,828
Speaker 0: what's the one that was at Riverside?

676
00:49:33,889 --> 00:49:37,360
Speaker 0: It was like Thunderbolt or something and that thing was shaky as fuck.

677
00:49:37,481 --> 00:49:40,180
Speaker 0: It was like, you know, it was a normal looking roller coaster.

678
00:49:40,180 --> 00:49:44,040
Speaker 0: You go up you go down a hill you make a turn you come back you go down another hill, right?

679
00:49:44,500 --> 00:49:49,200
Speaker 0: But the whole time it was like someone was shaking you like the vibration machine.

680
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:56,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the mean streak was the longest fastest wood style roller coaster in the world when they built it.

681
00:49:56,884 --> 00:50:03,779
Speaker 1: so it was the super super long ride and It was pretty fun and it was like a but it was a wooden coaster.

682
00:50:04,984 --> 00:50:17,620
Speaker 1: after a few years Wooden coasters tended to grade in quality rapidly and it got so shaky that it like I would literally get a splitting headache If I wrote it, I'd still ride it almost every year.

683
00:50:17,781 --> 00:50:29,160
Speaker 1: Anyway, I don't know why I just felt like I had to but I would not ride a traditional wooden coaster again unless there was some particular historic reason to.

684
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,639
Speaker 1: So Do you think you'll go to roll out to a amusement park again at some point?

685
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:38,989
Speaker 0: I'm sure sometime before I die.

686
00:50:39,030 --> 00:50:41,140
Speaker 1: Hopefully you want to go with me to Cedar Point this summer.

687
00:50:41,341 --> 00:50:46,619
Speaker 0: No, I would like to go but the problem is it's just not worth it Considering how much of a pain in the ass it is to go there.

688
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,726
Speaker 1: That's why my plan is to fly there.

689
00:50:48,747 --> 00:50:54,739
Speaker 1: do like two or three days of like get all the roller coaster out of my system And then go back to my normal life.

690
00:50:55,562 --> 00:51:02,281
Speaker 1: It's still too much of a pain in the ass to go there Kinda like how I just did for Disney went to Disney and all the Disney out of my system and now I can wait a Decade.

691
00:51:02,301 --> 00:51:06,720
Speaker 1: I'll go back to Disney when like the new Star Wars land is fully fully fully complete.

692
00:51:07,781 --> 00:51:10,550
Speaker 0: So whatever roller coaster it is that we rode at Busch Gardens.

693
00:51:10,591 --> 00:51:11,333
Speaker 0: That was wooden.

694
00:51:11,353 --> 00:51:13,260
Speaker 0: He's not on their website anymore.

695
00:51:14,224 --> 00:51:15,208
Speaker 0: I don't understand that right.

696
00:51:15,228 --> 00:51:17,759
Speaker 0: people tearing that like you run an amusement park, right?

697
00:51:18,860 --> 00:51:19,663
Speaker 0: People are gonna like.

698
00:51:19,884 --> 00:51:24,460
Speaker 0: they're always trying to get like the biggest craziest ride or whatever but like, oh, why?

699
00:51:25,240 --> 00:51:26,058
Speaker 0: Are you like, you know?

700
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:29,609
Speaker 1: Smashing rides it's a point used to not like.

701
00:51:29,910 --> 00:51:33,180
Speaker 1: there was a point where they stopped tearing down roller coasters because they figured why not?

702
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:42,680
Speaker 1: Just keep adding them and always have the world record of having the most roller coasters But then they started destroying ones that didn't get ridden anymore that maintenance cost more than like the value.

703
00:51:42,821 --> 00:51:44,920
Speaker 0: I'm saying it's like you only care that people come to the park.

704
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,192
Speaker 0: You don't really care how much they ride when they come there.

705
00:51:47,212 --> 00:51:48,579
Speaker 0: You just wanted to come and stay right?

706
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,499
Speaker 0: So they're gonna come pretty much no matter what rides you fucking have.

707
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:53,784
Speaker 0: No, cuz I really.

708
00:51:53,824 --> 00:51:58,400
Speaker 0: are you really gonna get like more if you pay zillions of dollars for another roller coaster?

709
00:51:58,922 --> 00:52:02,340
Speaker 0: Is that really gonna bring in enough people to like pay for it and make you more money?

710
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:04,240
Speaker 0: So what with the rides you got already?

711
00:52:04,520 --> 00:52:06,126
Speaker 1: I think so Disney doesn't need to like.

712
00:52:06,187 --> 00:52:18,950
Speaker 1: I don't think Disney could probably get away with never fucking changing anything forever because it's such A cultural icon, but they change things constantly Yeah, but they also keep a lot of old stuff there Not as much what Nate.

713
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:20,637
Speaker 1: what's something new in the Magic Kingdom?

714
00:52:20,657 --> 00:52:22,085
Speaker 1: in the last decade I haven't been there.

715
00:52:22,145 --> 00:52:28,859
Speaker 1: So I don't know but I can tell you old stuff they got rid of Yeah, but most of the old stuff especially the ride rides are just still there and they're mostly the same.

716
00:52:29,886 --> 00:52:38,525
Speaker 1: but so like Cedar Point because it was like if a place has repeat traffic as opposed to occasional traffic like Regionally the people who go there every year.

717
00:52:38,927 --> 00:52:43,810
Speaker 1: they always have to have a piece of news to advertise to remind people Hey, there's new shit here.

718
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:44,234
Speaker 1: Come back.

719
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:57,246
Speaker 1: So like there would be ads on TV like as a kid right around like April Like May as they get toward the end of the school year ads would be on primetime TV Advertising the new roller coaster.

720
00:52:57,286 --> 00:53:00,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had those all kinds of ads like that advertising the new roller coaster.

721
00:53:01,241 --> 00:53:04,920
Speaker 1: People would come to the park who wouldn't otherwise go and line up for four hours to ride.

722
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:07,090
Speaker 0: But you could have just had an advertisement.

723
00:53:07,512 --> 00:53:09,300
Speaker 0: just say hey, we got a crazy amusement park.

724
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,055
Speaker 0: Holy shit, you don't need you know advertising the specific roller coaster.

725
00:53:12,075 --> 00:53:12,880
Speaker 0: How much did that really help?

726
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,026
Speaker 1: I guess it depends on.

727
00:53:14,147 --> 00:53:15,274
Speaker 1: are you getting a lot?

728
00:53:15,395 --> 00:53:16,180
Speaker 1: is your business?

729
00:53:16,460 --> 00:53:18,430
Speaker 0: What if you had spent the money building the roller coaster?

730
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:20,360
Speaker 0: I just more advertising instead, right?

731
00:53:20,520 --> 00:53:22,328
Speaker 0: Or just you already bought the advertising.

732
00:53:22,369 --> 00:53:23,333
Speaker 0: don't build the roller coaster.

733
00:53:23,353 --> 00:53:27,042
Speaker 0: You're gonna get the same number of visitors advertising the roller coaster You've already got.

734
00:53:27,143 --> 00:53:27,866
Speaker 1: I feel like what you're.

735
00:53:27,886 --> 00:53:31,059
Speaker 1: that philosophy you're talking about is how most amusement parks are run.

736
00:53:31,402 --> 00:53:34,789
Speaker 1: Hmm because they don't change that often I feel like the ones that do something different.

737
00:53:35,091 --> 00:53:43,660
Speaker 1: have some other business model around like Get like to having a region where you're trying to make sure that you have regulars who come every year forever like get people hooked.

738
00:53:43,781 --> 00:53:44,552
Speaker 0: I can understand.

739
00:53:44,572 --> 00:53:46,687
Speaker 0: if you know Disney has regulars like.

740
00:53:46,747 --> 00:53:51,210
Speaker 0: I understand having the biggest or the most or Changing significantly can help you.

741
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,140
Speaker 0: if you're pulling international traffic, right?

742
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,507
Speaker 0: It goes like or long-distance traffic Disney World.

743
00:53:55,808 --> 00:53:56,711
Speaker 0: you go to Disney World.

744
00:53:56,731 --> 00:53:59,420
Speaker 0: All right, and it's like, okay, you got this family.

745
00:53:59,522 --> 00:54:00,520
Speaker 0: They come good, right?

746
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:00,981
Speaker 0: We need that.

747
00:54:01,002 --> 00:54:06,840
Speaker 0: we want them to go to Disney World on vacation more years, right every year if possible if they're from far away.

748
00:54:07,302 --> 00:54:10,875
Speaker 0: But are they gonna come back to Disney World if it's the same exact thing as last year?

749
00:54:10,996 --> 00:54:12,000
Speaker 0: if they're not Disney nuts?

750
00:54:12,562 --> 00:54:19,925
Speaker 0: probably not and that's why you would update because you're whole you got to pull someone from far away and give them a reason to Make it worth coming because there's something crazy new.

751
00:54:20,286 --> 00:54:25,400
Speaker 0: but if it's just hey, you're in town come here and have a good time.

752
00:54:25,681 --> 00:54:27,729
Speaker 0: Well, you're gonna have a good time with the rides.

753
00:54:27,769 --> 00:54:28,452
Speaker 0: They already got.

754
00:54:28,472 --> 00:54:30,500
Speaker 0: it doesn't need to be a new ride every time.

755
00:54:31,604 --> 00:54:33,872
Speaker 1: I wouldn't go back like most amusement parks.

756
00:54:33,892 --> 00:54:34,995
Speaker 1: I've ever visited in my life.

757
00:54:35,497 --> 00:54:36,260
Speaker 1: I wrote every ride.

758
00:54:36,763 --> 00:54:38,697
Speaker 1: There's literally no reason for me to ever go back to them.

759
00:54:38,918 --> 00:54:40,204
Speaker 1: ever Disney.

760
00:54:40,225 --> 00:54:46,573
Speaker 1: there's only a reason for me to go back When you know, they do a full refresh and there's new Star Wars shit to see.

761
00:54:46,614 --> 00:54:48,520
Speaker 0: I feel like there's still a reason to go.

762
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:49,767
Speaker 0: You know, the ride is fun.

763
00:54:49,827 --> 00:54:54,519
Speaker 0: more than a few times, especially if you haven't written It's like new again.

764
00:54:54,580 --> 00:54:56,512
Speaker 1: Yeah I think that I guess it's partly I just got room.

765
00:54:56,552 --> 00:55:01,300
Speaker 1: I see your point like The crappiest roller coasters there are better than some of the best roller coasters at most places.

766
00:55:01,380 --> 00:55:02,666
Speaker 1: So I just like like.

767
00:55:02,686 --> 00:55:05,860
Speaker 1: I went to Canada Wonderland once and I wrote every coaster and they're all bullshit.

768
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:12,054
Speaker 1: I was like, well never coming back here Even though those roller coasters were fine by like a six flag standard.

769
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:14,224
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

770
00:55:14,304 --> 00:55:23,571
Speaker 1: I was a. I was an amusement park hobbyist Primarily around roller coasters as a kid and the only reason I didn't keep that up as a hobby Is that it's not a very active hobby.

771
00:55:23,591 --> 00:55:25,643
Speaker 1: It's not like I can build roller coasters Can't?

772
00:55:25,663 --> 00:55:26,909
Speaker 0: you'll build them in the backyard all time.

773
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:29,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I live in New York where I can build it my living room.

774
00:55:29,040 --> 00:55:30,137
Speaker 0: I guess you don't have to live in New York.

775
00:55:31,324 --> 00:55:46,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do Though something that's kind of I've always been even as a kid like I remember being really Disgusted like like actually disgusted by most of the other people who were at the amusement parks.

776
00:55:46,816 --> 00:56:00,536
Speaker 1: that weren't me and my friends Mmm, because as a kid, I remember a lot of the people in the park weren't there to ride roller coasters and Were incapable of moving quickly and we're often in my way on scooters

777
00:56:00,657 --> 00:56:04,111
Speaker 0: when someone is Touristing or and going to amusement park.

778
00:56:04,172 --> 00:56:06,040
Speaker 0: that is like when they are at their worst.

779
00:56:06,221 --> 00:56:08,634
Speaker 1: Yeah, like they're already slow cuz you're all slow.

780
00:56:08,734 --> 00:56:09,699
Speaker 1: Most people are slow, right?

781
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:13,038
Speaker 1: But now they're like they're going slow on purpose, but they're going slow.

782
00:56:13,118 --> 00:56:18,640
Speaker 0: relative People are waiting in lines in the heat bothered by kids.

783
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:32,660
Speaker 0: You know Way too much of that terrible food Carrying around a bunch of heavy crab that they don't need right, you know.

784
00:56:32,740 --> 00:56:33,062
Speaker 0: It's like.

785
00:56:33,443 --> 00:56:37,320
Speaker 0: that's the kind of things people are doing when they're, you know, touristy amusement park.

786
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:49,255
Speaker 0: And if you're just you know Trying to efficiently ride rides those vast majority people are gonna be in your way Yep, and I remember people getting particularly testy in lines.

787
00:56:49,897 --> 00:56:53,600
Speaker 0: It's it's hot out Yeah, and none of them would talk like standing around doing nothing.

788
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,240
Speaker 1: I remember standing in a line to ride a new roller coaster to Cedar Point with a bunch of high school friends.

789
00:56:58,542 --> 00:57:06,260
Speaker 1: We were in line for a little over three hours Which we didn't care cuz we can go anytime we want a couple hour drive But no one in the line was talking.

790
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:12,138
Speaker 1: They were just standing there in the heat being surly and we were talking and being loud and we're the only people.

791
00:57:12,438 --> 00:57:30,106
Speaker 1: so it was hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people silent and also being loud and I remember this one mother was just like staring at us and staring at us and then eventually she just yells shut up and everyone got silent and Then we just kept being loud again.

792
00:57:30,126 --> 00:57:30,971
Speaker 1: cuz what's she gonna do?

793
00:57:31,434 --> 00:57:32,439
Speaker 1: and that story doesn't go anywhere.

794
00:57:32,901 --> 00:57:35,009
Speaker 1: It's not like she could get through the turnstile to get to us.

795
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:35,430
Speaker 0: Mmm.

796
00:57:36,092 --> 00:57:37,578
Speaker 1: It's not like there's a rule against talking.

797
00:57:37,598 --> 00:57:39,308
Speaker 1: Mmm It really.

798
00:57:39,328 --> 00:57:55,373
Speaker 1: it really hits stark though like it really bothered me recently when we were at Disney World because I feel like a full third of the people there were Had lived such sedentary lives that they could not Walk the distances required to even experience Epcot.

799
00:57:55,855 --> 00:58:00,358
Speaker 1: and we're using mobility scooters even then even though in their normal lives, they are mobile and walk.

800
00:58:00,378 --> 00:58:05,091
Speaker 1: I Think literally one in three people in that park were in mobility scooters.

801
00:58:05,653 --> 00:58:09,387
Speaker 0: a lot of people don't walk Yeah in their daily lives.

802
00:58:09,407 --> 00:58:10,311
Speaker 0: They sit in a house.

803
00:58:10,733 --> 00:58:12,279
Speaker 0: They take a car to go anywhere.

804
00:58:13,601 --> 00:58:15,673
Speaker 1: Parking lot for the closest parking spot.

805
00:58:15,713 --> 00:58:16,880
Speaker 1: minimize walking, right?

806
00:58:17,080 --> 00:58:22,094
Speaker 0: People don't walk very much at all If they live a suburban lifestyle and suburban kind of people.

807
00:58:22,154 --> 00:58:29,319
Speaker 0: the kind of people go to use and park Yeah, and amusement park requires lots of walking, you know if you want to get from here to there.

808
00:58:29,600 --> 00:58:34,475
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if there's monorails and little cars and tram cars and things like that.

809
00:58:34,816 --> 00:58:36,200
Speaker 0: You still got to walk a whole bunch.

810
00:58:37,102 --> 00:58:38,390
Speaker 0: There's nothing you can do about it.

811
00:58:39,899 --> 00:58:41,888
Speaker 1: Oh I'm probably going to see your point.

812
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:44,299
Speaker 1: this summer chase wants to go so it might be like me Emily chase.

813
00:58:45,122 --> 00:58:46,029
Speaker 0: Sure, you don't want to go.

814
00:58:46,150 --> 00:58:48,545
Speaker 0: It's too much of a pain in the ass One weekend.

815
00:58:48,585 --> 00:58:49,209
Speaker 1: take one day off.

816
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:50,780
Speaker 0: We're in a weird-ass place.

817
00:58:51,865 --> 00:58:58,220
Speaker 0: It was a convenient place to go to Right near a major city where you could fly there direct or it was cheap.

818
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:00,676
Speaker 1: And but it's it's a couple hours from Detroit.

819
00:59:00,717 --> 00:59:05,134
Speaker 0: You can fly there So you gotta fly Detroit and then you got to get two hours away from Detroit.

820
00:59:05,155 --> 00:59:06,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, how do you do that?

821
00:59:06,860 --> 00:59:10,374
Speaker 0: It's not like a train Rent a car renting a car.

822
00:59:10,435 --> 00:59:17,339
Speaker 1: Okay, great Renting cars outside of New York like in New York, like it's a hundred plus dollars a day to rent a car.

823
00:59:17,821 --> 00:59:22,178
Speaker 1: But like outside of New York, I've rented cars for like eight dollars a day.

824
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:30,041
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's not a convenient trip where it's just nice and easy right place to Sandusky, Ohio $87.

825
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:31,889
Speaker 0: I'm just saying we could.

826
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:32,833
Speaker 1: it's a what what.

827
00:59:32,994 --> 00:59:34,199
Speaker 1: what are you gonna do in a weekend?

828
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,073
Speaker 0: Enjoy, New York a much better place.
