1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,070
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, January 25th.

2
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,080
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and I'm Rin, and this is Geek Next.

3
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:21,946
Speaker 0: Tonight we discuss Odoru Daiso Sase, a.k.a.

4
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:24,865
Speaker 0: Bayside Shake Dad, a.k.a.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,829
Speaker 0: Rhythm and Police.

6
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,277
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

7
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,700
Speaker 1: So I had a bit of an adventure going into work today.

8
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:45,437
Speaker 1: I talk about my car a lot lately, but my car, now that I spend 10 hours a week in it, has a great influence on my life.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:49,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just don't have problems with my car ever since I got a new one.

10
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,074
Speaker 0: You know, I used to be like, "Uh, car's old and shitty, huh?

11
00:00:52,195 --> 00:00:52,739
Speaker 0: Car's old and

12
00:00:52,779 --> 00:00:52,980
Speaker 0: shitty.".

13
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,170
Speaker 0: You used to drive- Then for like a week, it was like, "Uh, I got a new

14
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:56,552
Speaker 0: car.".

15
00:00:56,652 --> 00:00:57,758
Speaker 0: Then it's, "It's a

16
00:00:57,798 --> 00:00:58,019
Speaker 0: car.".

17
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:01,194
Speaker 1: You used to drive the second worst car I had ever sat in.

18
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:02,642
Speaker 0: The worst car- That was it?

19
00:01:02,662 --> 00:01:04,333
Speaker 0: That was the second worst car you ever sat in?

20
00:01:04,354 --> 00:01:05,319
Speaker 0: You're pretty good off.

21
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,540
Speaker 1: Well, the worst car I ever sat in was the identical car that James owned.

22
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:12,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, my car- my old car was bad, but it wasn't that bad.

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,670
Speaker 0: I've seen a lot worse cars.

24
00:01:15,032 --> 00:01:16,480
Speaker 0: Like, cars with holes in the floor.

25
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:18,019
Speaker 1: Oh, I've seen them, but I've never been in them.

26
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:19,365
Speaker 0: Ahh.

27
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:20,261
Speaker 1: Yeah.

28
00:01:20,944 --> 00:01:27,583
Speaker 1: But no, I get up, you know, I'm going to work like you do, and I get in my car, and I start it, and it's like any other day.

29
00:01:27,643 --> 00:01:29,449
Speaker 1: My car drives flawlessly.

30
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:34,712
Speaker 1: It's an old car, but despite the over 100,000 miles on it, it works like a perfect car.

31
00:01:34,753 --> 00:01:35,540
Speaker 1: Nothing's wrong with it.

32
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,044
Speaker 0: It goes.

33
00:01:36,407 --> 00:01:37,920
Speaker 0: It doesn't have air conditioning, but it goes.

34
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:45,244
Speaker 1: Yep, and actually, it goes pretty fast, and it's a fairly- considering what I paid for it, and considering it's only 120 horsepower, it performs pretty well.

35
00:01:45,726 --> 00:01:48,800
Speaker 1: I can get up to about 95 before it starts shaking or anything.

36
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:57,720
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I'm driving to work, and I'm just about to get on the Taconic, when suddenly, the battery light comes on.

37
00:01:58,466 --> 00:01:58,719
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

38
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:14,652
Speaker 1: Now, I'm thinking to myself, you know, and then, while I'm thinking to myself, I flash back to a couple years ago, where I was getting my car inspected for New York State, and I'm looking at it, and while they're doing everything, I tell the guy, "Could you please replace my battery?

39
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:16,580
Speaker 1: That's the original battery from this car.

40
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,505
Speaker 1: It's never been changed.

41
00:02:17,525 --> 00:02:18,450
Speaker 1: It's never been serviced.

42
00:02:18,591 --> 00:02:19,516
Speaker 1: I should probably just get a new

43
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:19,677
Speaker 1: one.".

44
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:25,700
Speaker 1: And he took one look at it, tested it, and said, "Not only is this battery fine, it's like new.

45
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,716
Speaker 1: I'll buy you a new battery and pay for your towing if that battery fails you within the next 100,000

46
00:02:30,716 --> 00:02:30,836
Speaker 1: miles.".

47
00:02:32,762 --> 00:02:33,586
Speaker 1: And I was like, "You know what?

48
00:02:33,627 --> 00:02:34,009
Speaker 1: Whatever.".

49
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,898
Speaker 1: And I kept the same battery in, and now-- Did he get that in writing?

50
00:02:37,781 --> 00:02:38,445
Speaker 1: I trust this guy.

51
00:02:38,505 --> 00:02:39,349
Speaker 1: I work with him all the time.

52
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,280
Speaker 1: He's been my mechanic for a long, long time.

53
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,620
Speaker 1: So I'm thinking back to this driving now, and my battery light come on, and I'm thinking, "Son of a fuck.

54
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:49,329
Speaker 1: That was a bad

55
00:02:49,471 --> 00:02:49,814
Speaker 1: idea.".

56
00:02:50,560 --> 00:03:04,359
Speaker 1: Because either my battery has done something catastrophic, which is somewhat possible because the battery is weird, or my alternator's died, which is the more likely thing in general-- Or somehow, in a freak accident, the wiring somewhere in there got messed up.

57
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,360
Speaker 1: Which isn't out of the realm.

58
00:03:05,661 --> 00:03:07,560
Speaker 0: It's not out of the realm, but it's not common.

59
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, old cars tend to have wiring problems.

60
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:14,100
Speaker 0: If the battery light goes on, 99% of the time, its alternator or battery is broken.

61
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,220
Speaker 1: Most likely, if it comes on while you're driving, it's alternator.

62
00:03:17,527 --> 00:03:17,680
Speaker 0: Yep.

63
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:21,560
Speaker 1: So now I have to debate, because I've just gotten on the Taconic.

64
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:28,880
Speaker 1: There's basically no civilization between that part of the Taconic where I just got on and my work.

65
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:31,575
Speaker 1: So I'm debating, "Can I make it to

66
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:31,796
Speaker 1: work?".

67
00:03:32,581 --> 00:03:37,880
Speaker 1: Because at my job, in the industrial pla-- Well, it was an industrial plaza, now it's more commercial.

68
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,638
Speaker 1: There's actually a mechanic right there.

69
00:03:40,202 --> 00:03:42,970
Speaker 0: Well, if you turn off your radio and your lights-- No.

70
00:03:44,064 --> 00:03:45,060
Speaker 1: See, it depends.

71
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,620
Speaker 1: I'm thinking-- I mean, I'm going all these calculations.

72
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:52,040
Speaker 1: Is my alternator dead, or is it just not charging the battery so well?

73
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:56,560
Speaker 1: Does that light mean the alternator's not charging it, or does it mean the battery is close to being drained?

74
00:03:57,701 --> 00:04:02,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's the same problem I have with Macs, is that they give you an error message like, "Printer not

75
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:02,638
Speaker 0: working."

76
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:07,959
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Well, why don't you give me some more information so I can actually figure out what the fuck I'm supposed to

77
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:08,119
Speaker 0: do?".

78
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,073
Speaker 0: Instead of just, "Eh, battery

79
00:04:10,113 --> 00:04:10,536
Speaker 0: problem."

80
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,434
Speaker 0: It's like, "Can I have more details,

81
00:04:12,475 --> 00:04:12,677
Speaker 0: please?".

82
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, my car has basically four lights.

83
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,420
Speaker 1: It has check engine, which means anything that isn't described by the other three.

84
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:19,807
Speaker 0: Yeah.

85
00:04:20,481 --> 00:04:22,939
Speaker 1: It has a battery light, which I'd never seen before.

86
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:28,700
Speaker 1: It has a fluid light that refers to any and all measurable fluids in the car.

87
00:04:29,542 --> 00:04:32,339
Speaker 1: If any fluid is low, including my gas, that light will come on.

88
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:34,000
Speaker 0: Oh, wow, I have a separate gas light.

89
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,959
Speaker 1: And then I have the analog brake and all that.

90
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,939
Speaker 1: But, so now I'm thinking, "Ah, shit, what do I do?

91
00:04:41,421 --> 00:04:43,474
Speaker 1: I know where a mechanic is, but I have to go

92
00:04:43,494 --> 00:04:43,796
Speaker 1: north.".

93
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:48,460
Speaker 1: And at the last second, I decide, "All right, I'm getting off because I'm at this exit.

94
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:50,717
Speaker 1: I'm not going to risk it breaking down on this

95
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,020
Speaker 1: conic.".

96
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:54,140
Speaker 1: So I turn around, I go back up north, and I pull into this mechanic.

97
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,860
Speaker 1: Now, while I'm driving back up north, my headlights, my daytime running lights dim a little bit.

98
00:05:00,063 --> 00:05:00,271
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

99
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:06,679
Speaker 1: Then my analog brake light comes on, meaning that there is now no longer enough power for analog brakes.

100
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:07,132
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

101
00:05:07,805 --> 00:05:09,420
Speaker 0: Then- At least you still have normal brakes.

102
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:12,320
Speaker 1: My power steering ceases to function.

103
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:14,500
Speaker 0: Oh, now it's going to be real hard to drive.

104
00:05:15,043 --> 00:05:15,256
Speaker 1: Yes.

105
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:21,460
Speaker 1: So I obviously had made the right decision, and I kind of hobble into this mechanic, but I've seen this mechanic.

106
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,418
Speaker 1: I've driven past it.

107
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:26,659
Speaker 1: I've never so much as stopped anywhere near this guy.

108
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,236
Speaker 0: And you say, "Hey, man, you got a battery in

109
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:29,458
Speaker 0: there?".

110
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,819
Speaker 1: No, so I pull in, and I leave the car running, because once I turn it off- It's over.

111
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,820
Speaker 0: Well, if you're at the mechanic, I would feel safe turning it off.

112
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:42,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so I don't want them to have to drag the car into their little bit.

113
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:42,839
Speaker 0: Oh, that's true.

114
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:48,182
Speaker 1: So I walk in, and I'm like, my battery came on, and he's like, "I ever had a problem with your

115
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:48,636
Speaker 1: alternator?".

116
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,293
Speaker 1: And I said, "I've never had a problem with this

117
00:05:50,334 --> 00:05:50,576
Speaker 1: car.".

118
00:05:51,448 --> 00:05:52,000
Speaker 0: Well, you have.

119
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:57,220
Speaker 1: No, I had one problem a long time ago that was resolved handily for almost no money.

120
00:05:58,141 --> 00:06:01,039
Speaker 1: In fact, the problem was so simple, I could have fixed it myself if I'd known.

121
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,420
Speaker 1: But this car has had no major repairs ever.

122
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:05,358
Speaker 0: Well, except for the time you crushed it.

123
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:11,280
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, when I was involved in a seven-car pileup on 490 outside of Rochester.

124
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,520
Speaker 1: But even then, that was purely cosmetic damage.

125
00:06:14,882 --> 00:06:16,400
Speaker 1: The car itself has had no repairs.

126
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:20,100
Speaker 1: And, you know, why would the alternator suddenly fail?

127
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:21,660
Speaker 1: It's been fine forever, but, you know, he tested.

128
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:24,360
Speaker 0: Because moving parts don't last forever.

129
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it failed completely.

130
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:27,059
Speaker 0: Entropy is the win.

131
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,840
Speaker 1: It failed completely and suddenly.

132
00:06:30,241 --> 00:06:30,536
Speaker 0: All right.

133
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:39,000
Speaker 1: So the guy replaces my alternator, and while he's doing this, I tell him, "Replace my drive train belt thingy," because that thing is also original.

134
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,333
Speaker 1: And he's like, "Yeah, it's kind of

135
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:40,859
Speaker 1: old-looking.".

136
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,059
Speaker 1: And it's cheap to do, since he's taking the alternator off anyway.

137
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:46,880
Speaker 1: But more importantly, I tell him, "And while you're at it, replace that battery.

138
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,075
Speaker 1: It's the original freaking

139
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:48,420
Speaker 1: battery.".

140
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,040
Speaker 1: He's like, "Really?

141
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:49,887
Speaker 1: Really?".

142
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:51,655
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Yeah, it's almost 10 years

143
00:06:51,796 --> 00:06:51,877
Speaker 1: old.".

144
00:06:52,241 --> 00:06:53,799
Speaker 1: He's like, "You've never done anything to

145
00:06:53,859 --> 00:06:53,900
Speaker 1: it?".

146
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,174
Speaker 1: He's like, "I've never even looked at

147
00:06:55,235 --> 00:06:55,276
Speaker 1: it.".

148
00:06:56,462 --> 00:06:58,357
Speaker 1: And he's like, "All right, I'll replace

149
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:58,458
Speaker 1: it.".

150
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,754
Speaker 1: "Yeah, goddamn, shouldn't have left that in

151
00:07:00,794 --> 00:07:00,976
Speaker 1: there.".

152
00:07:01,762 --> 00:07:03,320
Speaker 1: So then he's replacing the alternator.

153
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,694
Speaker 1: He comes out and he says, "Come

154
00:07:04,735 --> 00:07:04,856
Speaker 1: here.".

155
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,518
Speaker 1: So I come out and he says, "You're sure this is the original

156
00:07:07,558 --> 00:07:07,800
Speaker 1: battery?".

157
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,958
Speaker 1: I'm like, "Yes, this is the battery that came with the car when it was

158
00:07:09,998 --> 00:07:10,099
Speaker 1: new.".

159
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:13,280
Speaker 1: And he says, "This battery is acting like a brand new battery.

160
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,334
Speaker 1: There's no reason to replace

161
00:07:14,354 --> 00:07:14,395
Speaker 1: it.".

162
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,539
Speaker 0: - What the hell?

163
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,760
Speaker 1: - This battery is like the battery of the gods.

164
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:24,080
Speaker 0: - I think that there must be something wrong with the battery that fools the detection machines that test the battery.

165
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,340
Speaker 1: - Because the battery is just fine.

166
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:34,640
Speaker 1: Not only is the battery fine, but despite the fact that it wasn't being charged for some amount of time, it managed to get me like eight miles back to a mechanic.

167
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:42,320
Speaker 0: - I think I'll have to submit the battery to some battery test lab and then they can make more batteries like it for other applications like laptops.

168
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:47,560
Speaker 1: - Well, see, because my family has a history of appliances and cars lasting far longer than they should.

169
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:56,920
Speaker 0: - Wait, you're suggesting somehow your genealogy is responsible for a magical physics-defying battery?

170
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,920
Speaker 1: - Well, you know, that is obviously the only logical solution because random chance, there's no way.

171
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,060
Speaker 1: I mean, what?

172
00:08:05,084 --> 00:08:06,320
Speaker 1: Ah, ah, call Randy.

173
00:08:07,467 --> 00:08:14,638
Speaker 1: But I mean, no, seriously, my grandparents have a fridge that they've had since the '50s, and it's without service, been working perfectly to this day, and they still use it.

174
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,080
Speaker 0: - Hey, what you gonna do?

175
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,097
Speaker 1: - Keep using it.

176
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:17,309
Speaker 0: - Yep.

177
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:20,320
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so I've still got that battery.

178
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,029
Speaker 1: That battery has seen 130,000 miles and almost 10 years of driving.

179
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:24,578
Speaker 0: - Cool.

180
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,379
Speaker 1: - And that's the end of my story.

181
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,780
Speaker 1: I got to work two hours late, no one batted an eye.

182
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:33,080
Speaker 0: - Yeah, so I'm at work today and not doing any work, of course.

183
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:39,659
Speaker 0: And I realize, hey, 'cause I set up this website at work where people can apply to work at our company.

184
00:08:40,662 --> 00:08:43,558
Speaker 0: So I checked it to see if there were any new applications, and there were.

185
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,555
Speaker 0: So I emailed my boss, "Hey, here's some

186
00:08:45,595 --> 00:08:46,080
Speaker 0: applications.".

187
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:49,240
Speaker 0: And he said, "Cool," like a second later.

188
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,209
Speaker 0: So then I'm like, "Oh yeah, I keep forgetting I'm taking off Katsu-kan,".

189
00:08:53,229 --> 00:08:53,653
Speaker 0: and he says,

190
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:54,176
Speaker 0: "Okay.".

191
00:08:54,823 --> 00:08:55,209
Speaker 0: And I'm like,

192
00:08:55,229 --> 00:08:55,371
Speaker 0: "Huh.".

193
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:04,496
Speaker 0: Then I'm like, "Since you're responding so quickly, can we discuss this issue that, you know, you keep avoiding and never

194
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:04,979
Speaker 0: discussing?".

195
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,440
Speaker 1: - The thing you're supposed to be working on, but no one ever gets back with you?

196
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,859
Speaker 0: - Well, it's more like a recent problem that's come up.

197
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:14,200
Speaker 0: that's under my responsibility, and I need someone else to do something.

198
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,640
Speaker 0: I can't just do it all on my own.

199
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,140
Speaker 0: I need some discussion, some decision-making.

200
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:19,900
Speaker 1: - Welcome to my goddamn world.

201
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:25,859
Speaker 1: I could do all the work I'm given at any job I've ever had in like one day a week if it weren't for the fact that I have to rely on other people.

202
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:28,280
Speaker 0: - Yeah, so he doesn't respond immediately.

203
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:32,454
Speaker 0: (laughing).

204
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,767
Speaker 0: - The other things.

205
00:09:33,848 --> 00:09:36,579
Speaker 0: I emailed him, he responded within a second with one word.

206
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,920
Speaker 0: This one, no immediate response.

207
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,700
Speaker 0: A few hours later, doo-doo, there's an Outlook email, and it says, "Yeah, can we talk about that on Monday?

208
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:47,895
Speaker 0: I'm on vacation in the Dominican

209
00:09:47,915 --> 00:09:48,318
Speaker 0: Republic.".

210
00:09:48,520 --> 00:09:48,756
Speaker 1: - What?

211
00:09:50,144 --> 00:09:50,996
Speaker 0: Why was he checking in?

212
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,098
Speaker 0: See, I don't get this.

213
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,040
Speaker 0: - Well, with the Blackberry action.

214
00:09:53,180 --> 00:10:14,557
Speaker 1: - No, that's not cool, 'cause everyone I work with, if they have any meat, they'll check their work email every day when they're on vacation, and they check it over the weekends, and they check it at night, and as far as I'm concerned, unless I'm on call for something specific, like make sure this doesn't break overnight on this day, I turn my pager off, and I don't even think about work until eight in the morning the next

215
00:10:14,578 --> 00:10:14,659
Speaker 0: day.

216
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:18,680
Speaker 0: - The thing is, when you have a smartphone, you've got all your emails going to this one device.

217
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:23,480
Speaker 1: - Oh, I'd set up a filter that would queue up and not show me work email on weekends.

218
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,079
Speaker 1: - You can't do that.

219
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,879
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I could.

220
00:10:25,224 --> 00:10:26,280
Speaker 0: It'd be difficult.

221
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
Speaker 1: - Plus, I wouldn't even send my real email to a smartphone.

222
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:38,540
Speaker 1: Email is, to me, exists solely to talk to people who aren't on aim, I can't call, and I want a record of my conversation in case I need to cover my own ass later.

223
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,995
Speaker 0: - Well, that's what people do, and--.

224
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:46,860
Speaker 1: - God, most email I send at work these days is simply proving that I put due diligence forth on something.

225
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:55,060
Speaker 0: - Yeah, so it made me realize, not only does my work not know or care what I do most of the time, but apparently I don't know what they do.

226
00:10:55,240 --> 00:11:01,500
Speaker 0: I mean, think about this, Rim, if your boss went on vacation to the Dominican Republic next week, all week, would you know?

227
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,200
Speaker 1: - God, well, it depends.

228
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:15,360
Speaker 1: I mean, at IBM, there'd be a lot of times where we'd be sitting around, and something would be going down, and we'd be like, all right, we need to talk to the boss, and then someone would ask the ever-present question, where is the boss?

229
00:11:15,726 --> 00:11:16,379
Speaker 1: Is she in today?

230
00:11:16,721 --> 00:11:18,759
Speaker 1: I thought I saw her this morning, but I wasn't sure.

231
00:11:19,263 --> 00:11:20,060
Speaker 1: Is she in her office?

232
00:11:20,402 --> 00:11:22,356
Speaker 1: Well, she's not on same time, huh.

233
00:11:24,303 --> 00:11:29,100
Speaker 1: But then again, in my work now, I get a month's notice if anyone's gonna be gone for five minutes.

234
00:11:29,540 --> 00:11:31,740
Speaker 0: - Yeah, so I want everyone out there to think about this.

235
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,039
Speaker 0: Maybe start a thread in the forum.

236
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:36,319
Speaker 0: If your boss went on vacation, would you know about it?

237
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:44,519
Speaker 0: I mean, my boss apparently is in the Dominican Republic all week, and I had no clue until I tried to talk to him, which I don't do so often.

238
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:50,079
Speaker 1: - Huh, of course, see, I'm a weird case, 'cause I rarely have a boss straight up.

239
00:11:50,340 --> 00:12:00,699
Speaker 0: - Well, I mean, I don't know if there's technically, there isn't sort of this boss kind of thing, but I mean, I'm the programmer, and he's a CTO, so he's above me.

240
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:07,639
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, there's a person who clearly, this is the person who will be giving you assignments, and without their input, you won't do anything new.

241
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,478
Speaker 0: - Uh-huh.

242
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,200
Speaker 1: - That's what I would call a boss, at least in the technology world.

243
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,060
Speaker 0: - I don't know, it's sorta, it's weird.

244
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:19,799
Speaker 0: - 'Cause really, in technology-- - The point is, my job is fucked up, and I'm trying to find a new one.

245
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:29,417
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I would be trying to find a new one, except my company pays me quite a bit, considering how, I guess, non-technical the job requirements actually are.

246
00:12:30,942 --> 00:12:36,280
Speaker 1: But yes, it's not Monday, it's Thursday, so we're allowed to go on rants, but we're not gonna go too long.

247
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,359
Speaker 0: - Let's move on some news.

248
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:52,959
Speaker 1: - All right, so on Digg, you might've seen that there was this thing about how, hey, if you microwave a wet sponge for 30 seconds or so, you can de-germify it, clean it up, and whatever, and now it'll be like a brand new sponge, and it won't smell bad.

249
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,998
Speaker 0: - It makes sense, unless you have the problem I have, which is where the sponges get shredded by knives, 'cause we don't have a dishwasher.

250
00:12:59,460 --> 00:13:08,000
Speaker 0: So you have to clean all the knives with the sponge, and thus the sponges get cut up, and then I needed to change the sponge out, even if the sponge is perfectly clean.

251
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,439
Speaker 1: - Also the forks and some of the spatulas, they just do a number on our sponges.

252
00:13:12,445 --> 00:13:15,579
Speaker 0: As soon as you get a dishwasher, we'll be able to use a lot fewer sponges.

253
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:21,139
Speaker 1: - But yeah, this is old news, but for some reason it was all over Digg, and even some mainstream media picked up on it a little bit.

254
00:13:22,381 --> 00:13:23,931
Speaker 1: The news here is that there

255
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:24,313
Speaker 0: has been a

256
00:13:24,555 --> 00:13:39,399
Speaker 1: follow-up set of stories on every major news outlet today, talking about the numerous fires, injuries, and accidents that have come about as a result of people who probably don't know much about physics and have no business owning a microwave trying to emulate this trick.

257
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:40,760
Speaker 0: - Oh my God.

258
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:47,331
Speaker 1: - Apparently a lot of people heard about this through various means and thought, "Hey, that's a great

259
00:13:47,412 --> 00:13:47,675
Speaker 1: idea.".

260
00:13:48,322 --> 00:13:59,600
Speaker 1: So they went to their microwave, they dutifully put their dry, not soaked in water sponge in the microwave, which is the same as putting nothing in the microwave.

261
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:05,240
Speaker 1: They then turned the microwave on for like five minutes and walked away, assuming it would sterilize the sponge.

262
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:06,399
Speaker 0: - Five minutes?

263
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,300
Speaker 1: - Well in many cases, they just didn't put a wet sponge in.

264
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:11,660
Speaker 1: I mean, running an empty microwave is not the best idea.

265
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,459
Speaker 0: - All right, now go ahead.

266
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:16,540
Speaker 0: Did anyone put some steel wool or a Brillo pad in there?

267
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:16,943
Speaker 0: - Yes.

268
00:14:16,963 --> 00:14:18,600
Speaker 0: - Oh, oh God.

269
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:24,340
Speaker 1: - So now, there are stories on CNN and MSNBC about such things as, "Yes, you can do this.

270
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:25,719
Speaker 1: "Make sure you wet the sponge.

271
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,280
Speaker 1: "Make sure your sponge does not contain metal.

272
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,159
Speaker 1: "Make sure you keep an eye on it.

273
00:14:30,381 --> 00:14:32,299
Speaker 1: "Make sure you only do it for a short amount of time.

274
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:34,320
Speaker 1: "Be warned, the sponge will be hot.

275
00:14:34,401 --> 00:14:35,297
Speaker 1: "when you try to remove

276
00:14:35,338 --> 00:14:35,378
Speaker 1: it.".

277
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,720
Speaker 0: - Yeah, this actually kind of fooled me for a second.

278
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:41,539
Speaker 0: Like when I saw the story on Digg, I saw the headline only, I didn't read it.

279
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:43,414
Speaker 0: I said, "That makes a lot of sense,

280
00:14:43,454 --> 00:14:43,817
Speaker 0: yeah.".

281
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:46,200
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Someone should just make a dishwasher.

282
00:14:46,724 --> 00:14:48,577
Speaker 0: "that uses microwaves to clean all the

283
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:48,900
Speaker 0: dishes.".

284
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:52,276
Speaker 0: And then I said, "Wait a minute, "you couldn't put silverware in

285
00:14:52,337 --> 00:14:52,679
Speaker 0: there.".

286
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,219
Speaker 1: - Not at all.

287
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:57,618
Speaker 0: - But other than that, it's an okay idea when you think about it.

288
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:02,240
Speaker 0: If something is microwave safe, there's no reason you couldn't clean it with microwaves.

289
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,299
Speaker 1: - Well, except that microwaves wouldn't remove physical gunk, all it would do is disinfect.

290
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:06,938
Speaker 0: - Eventually they would.

291
00:15:08,101 --> 00:15:11,320
Speaker 1: - Nah, 'cause depending on the gunk, it might not even burn or anything.

292
00:15:12,381 --> 00:15:18,200
Speaker 1: Most of the microwaves died because if you run microwaves, especially older ones without anything in 'em, they'll just burn themselves out.

293
00:15:19,020 --> 00:15:20,160
Speaker 0: - Mm, I guess maybe.

294
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:25,120
Speaker 0: a dishwasher with some sort of microwave action might, it might be okay.

295
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:28,459
Speaker 1: - Most modern dishwashers basically steam clean--.

296
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,660
Speaker 0: - Yeah, well they have the steam clean super heat burning everything to death function.

297
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,099
Speaker 1: - Yeah, which we'd probably use.

298
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:36,520
Speaker 0: - They use it once in a while to super clean the dishes.

299
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,300
Speaker 1: - Once a month to clean all the silverware.

300
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:41,400
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it makes all the dishes real hot though, like hotter than the microwave.

301
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,159
Speaker 0: - That's fine.

302
00:15:42,681 --> 00:15:44,716
Speaker 1: We have enough dishes to entertain like 40 people.

303
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:46,759
Speaker 0: I don't think-- - I don't think we, oh.

304
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:47,548
Speaker 1: - Well, silverware.

305
00:15:47,568 --> 00:15:48,439
Speaker 0: - Yeah, oh, okay.

306
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,760
Speaker 1: - We have enough silverware to entertain 40 people.

307
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,659
Speaker 0: - Hey, if you count the plastic silverware, yes.

308
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,380
Speaker 1: - Oh God, if you count the plastic silverware.

309
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,960
Speaker 0: - All right, so remember Diebold?

310
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,000
Speaker 1: - I'm well aware of the company called Diebold.

311
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:04,699
Speaker 1: - Yeah, well, apparently-- - They make voting machines for those of you who are unawares.

312
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:09,140
Speaker 0: - Incredibly insecure and faulty voting, electronic voting machines.

313
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,280
Speaker 1: - Lots of shady business going around left and right.

314
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:21,260
Speaker 0: - Yes, the government trusts this, the US government trusts this company to make sure that electronic voting works and is not hacked or frauded or anything.

315
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,700
Speaker 1: - Well, these machines have already been compromised in almost every single way possible.

316
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,540
Speaker 1: Are you telling me that the last possible way has been compromised?

317
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:38,840
Speaker 0: - Well, apparently, the company Diebold on their website, oh, okay, these voting machines all have a key that you can use to physically open them, all right?

318
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,239
Speaker 0: And that's pretty secure, a key.

319
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:45,078
Speaker 0: I mean, this key's not the most secure thing in the world, but you gotta copy a key, it's not--.

320
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,460
Speaker 1: - Yeah, well, I mean, think about it, even if-- - You need to call a locksmith to sit there.

321
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:59,899
Speaker 1: - Well, no, even if it's a pickable lock, 'cause almost all locks are easily pickable, it takes a non-trivially amount of time, like, it takes a couple minutes, and you can't just sit there using a bump key inside of the voting booth, they'll notice.

322
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:05,680
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and nobody's gonna have these keys except election workers and Diebold themselves.

323
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:11,400
Speaker 1: - Granted, there were corrupt election workers at the most recent election where I voted, but I digress.

324
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:18,839
Speaker 0: - Yes, anyway, remember how Princeton was doing a study on these voting machines and showed how they were all insecure and everything?

325
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:28,319
Speaker 0: Well, they noticed on the Diebold website, because if you're studying Diebold machines, you're gonna go to Diebold's website, that there was a picture of the key.

326
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:32,840
Speaker 1: - Um, was this the high resolution picture, per chance?

327
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,400
Speaker 0: - It wasn't, I don't know how high the resolution was.

328
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:40,680
Speaker 1: - What, they've got like an HDTV screenshot fully zoomed in of the keys on it?

329
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:40,760
Speaker 1: -

330
00:17:40,841 --> 00:17:59,040
Speaker 0: I don't know, but they took the picture of the key, they went to Ace Hardware, they got some similar looking keys, and they sculpted the keys, you know, into look like the one in the picture, and two out of the three keys opened the test voting machine that they had for their lab.

331
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:00,160
Speaker 1: - Outstanding.

332
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:12,300
Speaker 0: - So Diebold realized this mistake, and changed the picture on the website to a picture of a digital key card, instead of the physical key to open the voting machines.

333
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:16,100
Speaker 1: - Yeah, way to close that barn door, I'm sure those horses will.

334
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:17,677
Speaker 0: - That's what it says right here.

335
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:21,517
Speaker 0: It says, "Shutting the barn door after horse has

336
00:18:21,577 --> 00:18:21,778
Speaker 0: left.".

337
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:28,099
Speaker 1: - See, you gotta be in that, like in WarioWare, smooth moves when those customers are trying to get out of your store, you just gotta pull that thing down.

338
00:18:28,460 --> 00:18:29,560
Speaker 0: - That's right, that's right.

339
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,900
Speaker 1: - Of course, maybe if you just never opened it in the first place.

340
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:42,180
Speaker 0: - Yeah, this is just a lesson in security, and for everyone out there who, you know, is not security minded, don't put a picture of your frickin' key anywhere.

341
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:52,130
Speaker 1: - Things of the day.

342
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,510
Speaker 1: So cats don't like to get wet, that is well known.

343
00:18:55,650 --> 00:19:01,350
Speaker 1: I have watched people attempt to watch cats who did not want to be washed, and serious injuries have resulted.

344
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:05,950
Speaker 0: - I've always seen people who use like, spray bottles of water to like, tame their cats.

345
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,510
Speaker 1: - That doesn't wash them, however.

346
00:19:07,670 --> 00:19:08,670
Speaker 0: - No, it doesn't wash them.

347
00:19:08,690 --> 00:19:12,090
Speaker 1: - All that does is piss them off and cause them to further plot your demise.

348
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:13,290
Speaker 0: - All right.

349
00:19:13,890 --> 00:19:16,690
Speaker 1: - So basically, I've seen people wash cats.

350
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:23,470
Speaker 1: that tends to involve wearing leather gloves, holding the cat at arm's length, into a spray of water, and holding it there.

351
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:26,850
Speaker 0: - You'll get to scratch up your arms pretty bad.

352
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,930
Speaker 1: - That's why you tend to wear protective equipment.

353
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:33,510
Speaker 0: - Can't you just take your cat to like a grooming place that'll wash your cat for you?

354
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:38,389
Speaker 1: - Well you can, and thanks to the power of the internet, we now know what goes on in many of these places.

355
00:19:38,990 --> 00:19:42,790
Speaker 1: Apparently there's a product that is basically a torture chamber for cats.

356
00:19:43,050 --> 00:19:43,287
Speaker 1: - What?

357
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,930
Speaker 1: - It's this box, and it's called like a pet spa.

358
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,730
Speaker 0: - Wait, wait, wait, if you took it to a grooming place, wouldn't like, one person just hold the cat, and then another person wash it for you?

359
00:19:53,930 --> 00:20:00,010
Speaker 1: - That's not, I mean, cats are pretty strong, and you're gonna have to pretty much hold the cat's arms and legs so it doesn't scratch everybody.

360
00:20:01,292 --> 00:20:04,728
Speaker 1: I imagine they use this on cats that are particularly, I don't know, evil.

361
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:15,348
Speaker 1: But, all right, so this video is kinda, I mean it's funny, but at the same time, that poor cat, but at the same time, the cat probably smelled a little bit better when this was all over.

362
00:20:16,110 --> 00:20:16,510
Speaker 0: - Okay.

363
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,409
Speaker 1: - So they take this cat, and they put it in this box with a big window door.

364
00:20:21,711 --> 00:20:23,149
Speaker 1: It looks like a washing machine.

365
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:29,087
Speaker 1: So they close the door, and the cat's just kinda sittin' there like, the fuck is this shit, childs?

366
00:20:29,851 --> 00:20:30,689
Speaker 1: What's goin' on?

367
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,703
Speaker 1: The cat's lookin' around like, ugh.

368
00:20:32,871 --> 00:20:37,510
Speaker 1: Then the guy walks up, and he punches in some settings, like air temperature and water temperature and whatever.

369
00:20:38,711 --> 00:20:43,408
Speaker 1: And the cat suddenly jumps and looks around with his look of, oh no, you didn't.

370
00:20:45,673 --> 00:20:48,830
Speaker 1: And it's at this moment that water starts to bubble up a little bit in the bottom.

371
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:55,110
Speaker 1: And the cat looks at the water and looks out the window, and that cat is ready to kill anyone.

372
00:20:55,670 --> 00:20:56,005
Speaker 1: (laughing).

373
00:20:56,351 --> 00:21:02,529
Speaker 1: Now this bubble of water turns into multi-directional spray, and at this point, the cat loses it.

374
00:21:03,911 --> 00:21:14,307
Speaker 1: And there's no way out, and the cat doesn't, the cat is basically like a guy screamin', fallin' off of a building, where eventually you just run out of breath and stop screamin', and just kinda take it.

375
00:21:14,991 --> 00:21:20,189
Speaker 1: The cats go freakin' out and freakin' out, press A, press A, water's in the room, it's gettin' you wet.

376
00:21:21,432 --> 00:21:28,009
Speaker 1: And then finally, the cat just gets so tired that it just kinda half-assedly is poking at the door like, bastards, all of you.

377
00:21:29,614 --> 00:21:36,950
Speaker 1: And when they finally take the cat out, it has this look of just, I can't describe how angry and tired this cat looks.

378
00:21:37,953 --> 00:21:41,329
Speaker 1: I feel bad for it, but at the same time, how else are you gonna wash a cat?

379
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:42,368
Speaker 0: - The hose.

380
00:21:44,413 --> 00:21:45,028
Speaker 0: Hoses work.

381
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:46,530
Speaker 1: - It's pretty hilarious.

382
00:21:47,331 --> 00:21:52,827
Speaker 1: And don't think it cruel of me that I laugh, because I guarantee that you will laugh at least a little bit at this.

383
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,449
Speaker 0: - How can you not?

384
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:55,690
Speaker 1: - Oh my God.

385
00:21:57,750 --> 00:22:05,269
Speaker 0: - So apparently there's a trivia game show in Britain, and I don't know the name of it, but someone else probably does, and they're gonna yell at me.

386
00:22:05,671 --> 00:22:08,089
Speaker 0: So I'm not even gonna say the name, because I might be wrong.

387
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:16,450
Speaker 0: But anyway, it appears from watching this video on YouTube that the way the show works is you choose a topic for yourself.

388
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:19,689
Speaker 0: Like, I could go on and say, ask me about Linux.

389
00:22:20,234 --> 00:22:21,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right, ask me about Linux.

390
00:22:22,230 --> 00:22:23,569
Speaker 0: Oh look, I know everything.

391
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:24,330
Speaker 0: Pund.

392
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:32,470
Speaker 0: And then at the second part of the show, they ask you general stuff, which is usually stuff you have no idea.

393
00:22:33,150 --> 00:22:35,690
Speaker 1: - Like pop star blah, football team blah.

394
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:36,949
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and you go, ah shit.

395
00:22:37,430 --> 00:22:41,110
Speaker 0: But, you know, and then I guess whoever, when you get questions right, you get points.

396
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:43,390
Speaker 0: It seems pretty good, it's kinda fun.

397
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:49,562
Speaker 0: Anyway, this chick went on the show, and she says, yeah, ask me about H.P.

398
00:22:49,602 --> 00:22:50,910
Speaker 0: Lovecraft, that's all right.

399
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:51,455
Speaker 0: - Ooh.

400
00:22:51,476 --> 00:22:52,110
Speaker 0: - That's right.

401
00:22:52,451 --> 00:22:53,930
Speaker 0: And she's like, yeah, I know that shit.

402
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:54,907
Speaker 0: What you gonna do about it?

403
00:22:55,493 --> 00:22:56,168
Speaker 0: And it's pretty cool.

404
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,210
Speaker 1: - I gotta say-- - You're the chicks in Britain.

405
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,206
Speaker 1: - I'm a huge fan of H.P.

406
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:03,870
Speaker 1: Lovecraft, but I couldn't answer three quarters of those questions.

407
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:08,504
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and for anyone who, you know, is still kinda new to the whole H.P.

408
00:23:08,605 --> 00:23:11,530
Speaker 0: Lovecraft thing, you might learn something watching this.

409
00:23:11,610 --> 00:23:16,260
Speaker 0: 'Cause like in the middle part, the host guy kinda questions her out about H.P.

410
00:23:16,301 --> 00:23:18,110
Speaker 0: Lovecraft a little bit, and she gives you some information.

411
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,569
Speaker 0: Of course, you'll probably learn more going to Wikipedia, but hey.

412
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,729
Speaker 1: - Or just reading the Colorado of Space.

413
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:25,369
Speaker 0: - Yeah, or any of those other--.

414
00:23:25,450 --> 00:23:26,510
Speaker 1: - Or the thing on the doorstep.

415
00:23:26,610 --> 00:23:27,550
Speaker 0: - Or the Call of Cthulhu.

416
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:29,170
Speaker 1: - Tales of Horror and the Macabre.

417
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:29,889
Speaker 1: - Yeah, whatever.

418
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:31,290
Speaker 1: - Tales of Terror and Death.

419
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:34,329
Speaker 0: - Yeah, so, it's pretty cool, you should watch it.

420
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:37,068
Speaker 0: I don't know, this actually looks like a pretty cool quiz show.

421
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:43,690
Speaker 0: You know, it's definitely a lot better than that millionaire where I just get frustrated and go, goddamn, you're stupid, goddamn.

422
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:47,182
Speaker 1: (laughing) What orbits around God?

423
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,390
Speaker 1: Without further ado, we've been doing a lot of hard-hitting episodes lately.

424
00:23:54,610 --> 00:23:56,270
Speaker 0: Just in terms of-- - At least we think we have.

425
00:23:56,530 --> 00:24:03,090
Speaker 1: - Not in terms of particularly our content or the way we handle the show, but in terms of things that we particularly like.

426
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,689
Speaker 1: I mean, Dave and Joel talk a lot about things they don't like.

427
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:12,150
Speaker 1: We talk a lot about things we like, and this is something we like perhaps more than almost anything.

428
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:13,270
Speaker 0: - I don't know about that.

429
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:14,990
Speaker 0: - We like it a lot, though, a whole lot.

430
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,249
Speaker 0: - Well, consider-- - We like it as much as you like Initial D.

431
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:21,150
Speaker 1: - I think I like it more than Initial D. I think I like it twice as much as I like Initial D.

432
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,748
Speaker 0: - Oh, that's a whole lot of liking going on.

433
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:23,470
Speaker 0: - It is, goddamn.

434
00:24:23,470 --> 00:24:26,550
Speaker 0: - I like it as much as I like Initial D, which is a lot.

435
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,610
Speaker 1: - Odoru Daisousasen.

436
00:24:31,030 --> 00:24:33,070
Speaker 0: - Hey, hey, everyone listen to that carefully.

437
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:41,089
Speaker 0: Odoru Dais-- - So-- - I had it right, and now when I actually try to do it on the show, Daisousasen.

438
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:48,830
Speaker 1: - Yes, now the reason we say it and bring that up is that when we first heard of this and we found out, there's a whole story as to how we came up to this.

439
00:24:49,091 --> 00:24:54,090
Speaker 1: There were many near misses where we almost found out about this but didn't, due to our own stupidity.

440
00:24:54,170 --> 00:24:56,566
Speaker 0: - We'd be like, oh, doo doo, D.C.

441
00:24:56,606 --> 00:24:57,070
Speaker 0: Sousen.

442
00:24:57,310 --> 00:24:58,509
Speaker 1: - Well, we didn't even know what it was.

443
00:24:58,590 --> 00:24:59,124
Speaker 1: - Yeah, yeah.

444
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:05,949
Speaker 1: - An event for a longest time, I was like, Odoru Daisousasen, and finally our friend Katsu was like, RM, it's not how you say it.

445
00:25:06,230 --> 00:25:09,728
Speaker 0: - Yep, Daisousasen, Sousasen.

446
00:25:11,137 --> 00:25:11,528
Speaker 0: - O-A-E.

447
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:21,769
Speaker 1: - Before we go into the details of what exactly this is, other than the fact that it's awesome, I think we should give you a little bit of backstory as to how we discovered it, 'cause it's a convoluted and interesting tale.

448
00:25:22,070 --> 00:25:22,382
Speaker 0: - Mm-hmm.

449
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:38,343
Speaker 1: - You see, now remember, there's a pre-story before any of this when I was a freshman at RIT and our friend Katsu was a freshman, and he would talk fairly often about this cop drama from Japan that he was a big fan of, and we all just kinda totally brushed it off 'cause we had no way to see it, we

450
00:25:38,364 --> 00:25:38,606
Speaker 0: didn't--.

451
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,930
Speaker 0: - I remember him talking about it freshman year.

452
00:25:41,290 --> 00:25:44,849
Speaker 1: - I remember it partly because he had a scheme to try to fan sub it.

453
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:47,890
Speaker 0: - See, I remember that coming later, but it doesn't really matter.

454
00:25:48,070 --> 00:26:07,747
Speaker 1: - And he tried, he wanted my help, and I didn't know a lot about that sort of thing, I didn't have a genlock, and I didn't have all the good software to do it well nowadays, so we tried a little bit, I watched an episode raw, and I didn't know what it was, and I didn't understand it, so I didn't think it was that funny, and after a little while, we just kinda ignored it, and I forgot about it.

455
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:30,612
Speaker 1: - Fast forward, playing DDR, we're playing the song that is perhaps my second favorite song in DDR, and Katsu says to us, "Hey, that's the theme song "to my cop

456
00:26:30,632 --> 00:26:30,877
Speaker 1: show.".

457
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:38,019
Speaker 0: - See, I don't even remember that particular incident, I just remember somehow, we had this song in DDR.

458
00:26:38,442 --> 00:26:49,539
Speaker 0: that was a cool song that we liked to do, and somehow, it came into my brain from someone else that there's a TV show about police that goes with this song here.

459
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:56,097
Speaker 1: - See, I think it might have been for me, because when I played with Katsu, and then Katsu was like, "This is from that cop show,".

460
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,490
Speaker 1: and I was like, "Oh,

461
00:26:57,591 --> 00:26:58,136
Speaker 1: really?".

462
00:26:59,028 --> 00:26:59,720
Speaker 1: Rhythm and police.

463
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:13,380
Speaker 0: - But yeah, all I knew for the longest time was rhythm and police, it's a song in DDR, it's a cop show of some sort, and the theme song is really cool, and it's in DDR, and I like to dance it, and I wish I could find the show in English.

464
00:27:13,762 --> 00:27:23,945
Speaker 1: So then, we talked about it for a few days off and on, and it came up, and the gist was, Katsu had a bunch of it, untranslated, and that was basically the end of that, we weren't gonna--.

465
00:27:23,965 --> 00:27:25,236
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I'm not even, yeah.

466
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:30,080
Speaker 1: - I tried to watch an episode or two with him kinda translating, but I didn't have the magic.

467
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:32,079
Speaker 1: So whatever, forget about it.

468
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,560
Speaker 1: Fast forward to the future.

469
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:37,877
Speaker 0: - Well, every once in a while, we would play the song, and we would always think, "Ah, all right, there's a

470
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:38,119
Speaker 0: show.".

471
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,260
Speaker 1: - It's just like the tapestry with your family.

472
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,753
Speaker 1: It would just come up, and like, "Yeah, we should do something, eh,

473
00:27:42,793 --> 00:27:43,178
Speaker 1: whatever.".

474
00:27:44,264 --> 00:27:45,480
Speaker 1: So then, fast forward further.

475
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,720
Speaker 1: We have the Video Barn, which is the most awesome--.

476
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:58,620
Speaker 0: - Well, in Rochester, in, well, Henrietta, Rochester, New York, near RIT, there is a video rental place, much like a Blockbuster, however not Blockbuster, it is Video Barn.

477
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,340
Speaker 1: - Yeah, here's the caliber of this place.

478
00:28:00,581 --> 00:28:09,280
Speaker 1: We walked in, and we saw some movie that had just gibberish on it, moon language, but written over it in marker was very good sword fighting.

479
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:11,176
Speaker 0: - I think it said, "Sword fighting very

480
00:28:11,237 --> 00:28:11,439
Speaker 0: good.".

481
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,818
Speaker 1: - Something like that, so we decided--.

482
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,879
Speaker 0: - What was that, Princess Blade?

483
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:17,059
Speaker 1: - Princess Blade, which was a crap movie, but-- - Sword fighting very good.

484
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,740
Speaker 1: - Sword fighting very good indeed.

485
00:28:19,724 --> 00:28:23,955
Speaker 1: And you know, we went there once, we're like, "Hey, you ever heard of this movie called "Attack the Gas

486
00:28:23,975 --> 00:28:24,300
Speaker 1: Station?".

487
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:27,394
Speaker 0: - The guy reaches behind him, pulls the DVD out, and it's like, "Here you

488
00:28:27,415 --> 00:28:27,456
Speaker 0: go.".

489
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,656
Speaker 1: - Here you go, and then we bring it back, he's like, "They liked it, didn't

490
00:28:30,676 --> 00:28:30,737
Speaker 1: ya?".

491
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,660
Speaker 0: - These guys are pretty awesome.

492
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,520
Speaker 0: It's like the best damn video store in the world.

493
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:44,298
Speaker 0: I mean, not only did they have all sorts of awesome Asian films, not only did they have basically every anime ever released in the United States on VHS or DVD.

494
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:46,659
Speaker 1: - Including a lot of Japanese stuff.

495
00:28:46,961 --> 00:28:50,976
Speaker 0: - Yeah, not only did they have a huge selection of porn that I never looked at.

496
00:28:51,820 --> 00:28:52,700
Speaker 0: - Well, we walked in once.

497
00:28:52,800 --> 00:29:00,700
Speaker 0: - We walked in once, and let me tell you, the porn section of the video store looks a lot like really colorful manga from far away.

498
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,520
Speaker 0: - Yeah, until you get up close and-- - It looks like a bunch of teen magazines from far away.

499
00:29:05,301 --> 00:29:12,719
Speaker 0: With all these bright magenta and yellow colors all over the place, and so that's what I remember from going back there for like five seconds.

500
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:17,720
Speaker 0: - So Scott and I would often just-- - Oh yeah, they also had basically every movie ever.

501
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:22,080
Speaker 1: - Yeah, especially obscure stuff, and art house stuff.

502
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:28,320
Speaker 1: So Scott and I used to go a lot and just spend a half hour looking, pick a movie based on the cover.

503
00:29:28,741 --> 00:29:37,619
Speaker 1: Usually we'd look for more than one Yakuza, perhaps some lightning in the background, anything like that, anything-- - We always had trouble remembering to return stuff, the video bar.

504
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,919
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but they never cared.

505
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:39,637
Speaker 0: - No, they didn't.

506
00:29:39,820 --> 00:29:42,899
Speaker 1: - 'Cause they knew us, and they seemed to be really cool and kinda with it.

507
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,880
Speaker 0: - Yeah, anyone who was renting awesome movies, they liked.

508
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:48,118
Speaker 0: Anyone who was renting normal stuff, they were like, whatever.

509
00:29:48,220 --> 00:29:49,519
Speaker 1: - And they never steered us wrong.

510
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,580
Speaker 1: If they recommended something, it was solid gold.

511
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:51,969
Speaker 0: - Yep.

512
00:29:52,641 --> 00:30:00,859
Speaker 1: - So one day, Scott and I are there, and we don't have katsu around or anything, and we see this movie called Bayside Shakedown, and I'm like, hey.

513
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:03,520
Speaker 0: - I kinda wanted to get this ninja movie or something.

514
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,600
Speaker 1: - But I'm like, hey, wait a minute.

515
00:30:04,981 --> 00:30:08,860
Speaker 1: That guy kinda looks like the guy from that cop show that katsu always talks about.

516
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,460
Speaker 0: - I'm like, what?

517
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,700
Speaker 0: Are you saying that that's the rhythm and police whatnot?

518
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,218
Speaker 1: - And I'm like, I don't know.

519
00:30:13,582 --> 00:30:15,539
Speaker 1: So we're reading the back of it, and we're trying to figure it out.

520
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:18,359
Speaker 1: I tried to call katsu a bunch of times, but I couldn't get ahold of him.

521
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,100
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and I'm like, I don't know if this is it, man.

522
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:23,820
Speaker 0: It looks like just some random police movie.

523
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,859
Speaker 1: - So we decide after a while, it's either the ninja movie or this, and we decide we can't pass this up.

524
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,500
Speaker 1: There's a chance.

525
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,580
Speaker 1: Worst case, it sucks.

526
00:30:30,780 --> 00:30:31,899
Speaker 1: We deal with it, my bad.

527
00:30:32,841 --> 00:30:35,378
Speaker 1: So we take it home, and we watch it.

528
00:30:35,903 --> 00:30:39,699
Speaker 1: And we're not sure if it's the thing until the music starts.

529
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,679
Speaker 1: And at that point, we knew that we had struck gold.

530
00:30:43,060 --> 00:30:43,597
Speaker 1: This was it.

531
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,704
Speaker 1: We didn't know.

532
00:30:45,046 --> 00:30:47,200
Speaker 1: TV show, movie, multiple movies, whatever.

533
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:53,539
Speaker 1: All we knew was that this was a movie about the exact same thing that that cop show was.

534
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:58,020
Speaker 0: - It was a movie that was the thing the DDR song came from.

535
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:06,079
Speaker 1: - Now, not only is this movie so amazing, not only should we tell movies you should see to review it, why'd we tell them to do Attack the Gas Station?

536
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,519
Speaker 0: - No, Attack the Gas Station, I think, is more important.

537
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,120
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but they should do this.

538
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:12,240
Speaker 0: - I like this as much as I like Attack the Gas Station.

539
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:12,696
Speaker 1: - Yeah, me too.

540
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:16,219
Speaker 1: We then immediately showed it to a bunch of other people, like the whole crew.

541
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,580
Speaker 0: - It was like, oh shit, we found an awesome movie.

542
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,600
Speaker 0: We must show everyone.

543
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,600
Speaker 1: - And then we showed it to more people.

544
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,857
Speaker 1: We rented it multiple times.

545
00:31:23,260 --> 00:31:25,019
Speaker 0: - I think they did a fireside Friday with it.

546
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:25,484
Speaker 0: - Yep.

547
00:31:25,504 --> 00:31:26,600
Speaker 0: - Oh no, I remember.

548
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,172
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

549
00:31:27,193 --> 00:31:27,317
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

550
00:31:27,460 --> 00:31:32,679
Speaker 1: - So then, I was on the board of this anime club, this huge anime club for three years.

551
00:31:33,123 --> 00:31:40,940
Speaker 1: And I was president, I was riding high, I was at the peak of my popularity at RIT, I had my adoring fans, blah, blah, blah.

552
00:31:41,421 --> 00:31:47,100
Speaker 1: But the tradition at RIT is that when a president resigns at the end of his term, before he graduates--.

553
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:49,418
Speaker 0: - But when an anime club president resigns.

554
00:31:49,640 --> 00:32:02,440
Speaker 1: - Well, yeah, because-- - You're like, the tradition at RIT, when the president resigns, like what the president of RIT is-- At RIT, there was the anime club and the gaming club and the other gaming club, and pretty much every other club was just bupkis.

555
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:10,320
Speaker 1: I mean, the anime club had more members than like 80% of the rest of the clubs combined, and the gaming club was almost up there.

556
00:32:11,183 --> 00:32:12,939
Speaker 1: Like, the geek clubs outnumbered everyone else.

557
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:13,295
Speaker 0: - Yep.

558
00:32:13,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Speaker 1: - But the tradition was, when you're retiring, when you're done, when you're passing the reins on to another president, you get a showing that's all yours, you can show whatever anime you want.

559
00:32:23,361 --> 00:32:30,620
Speaker 1: And not only did I show Bayside Shakedown, which is not an anime, it's live action, but I built it up for months.

560
00:32:31,322 --> 00:32:37,399
Speaker 1: I mean, I'd leave hints like it's got an opening song that is also in a DDR game.

561
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:43,080
Speaker 0: - And when you, I remember when you put it in, some guy in the back was like, wait a minute, is this Rhythm and Police?

562
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,854
Speaker 1: - And at that moment, the song comes up and the crowd's like, woo, woo!

563
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:53,160
Speaker 1: And I'm like, yeah, by the way, it's live action.

564
00:32:53,241 --> 00:32:53,999
Speaker 1: The crowd's like, what?

565
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,060
Speaker 0: - And then they said, oh shit, it doesn't matter.

566
00:32:57,680 --> 00:33:01,819
Speaker 1: - Yeah, 'cause I pretty much told them, 'cause it was one of the highest, like there were so many people there.

567
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:03,059
Speaker 1: It was one of the biggest showings ever.

568
00:33:03,421 --> 00:33:05,600
Speaker 1: Not the biggest, no, but one of the biggest.

569
00:33:07,164 --> 00:33:10,420
Speaker 1: And not only, like I warned everyone, this isn't an anime, and they're like, what?

570
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:15,997
Speaker 1: I was like, I will stake all of my honor and I guarantee that you will all like this, I promise.

571
00:33:16,761 --> 00:33:18,080
Speaker 1: I put everything on the line.

572
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,039
Speaker 0: - And you did not lie.

573
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:25,860
Speaker 1: - Oh my God, there's a scene at the end of this movie where the crowd is silent, absolutely silent.

574
00:33:26,284 --> 00:33:28,760
Speaker 1: You could hear a pin drop in that room and everyone's like (gasps).

575
00:33:28,900 --> 00:33:30,639
Speaker 0: - That's my favorite part, where they're on top of the building.

576
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,120
Speaker 1: - Yeah, that and the car ride afterward.

577
00:33:35,223 --> 00:33:37,340
Speaker 1: When they're driving away and that sad music's playing.

578
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:38,539
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it's all right.

579
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:51,679
Speaker 1: - And then when the two big events happened, it was one of the few times in the history of the Anime Club where not only did the crowd cheer and scream, but they jumped up and gave a standing cheer scream applause in the middle of a movie.

580
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:55,020
Speaker 1: Not at the end, in the middle, because one thing happened.

581
00:33:55,141 --> 00:33:56,316
Speaker 1: That's how awesome this is.

582
00:33:57,703 --> 00:34:00,920
Speaker 1: It was so fantastic, that showing.

583
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:08,120
Speaker 0: - Anyway, I learned, to give you a perspective on how great this movie is, I'll give you a fact I learned today from Wikipedia, you ready?

584
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,880
Speaker 0: Oh, two facts from Wikipedia.

585
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:17,940
Speaker 0: Number one fact, this is the fifth best performing film in Japanese box office history.

586
00:34:18,841 --> 00:34:20,639
Speaker 0: Remember, this is Japan we're talking about.

587
00:34:20,719 --> 00:34:27,520
Speaker 0: This is competing with Miyazakis and Akira's and all those other live action Japanese movies.

588
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:29,719
Speaker 0: - Yeah, number-- - This is number five.

589
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:34,340
Speaker 0: There are only four better Japanese movies than this according to Japanese people.

590
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:38,578
Speaker 1: - Nevermind the fact that the show itself was crazy popular.

591
00:34:38,598 --> 00:34:38,780
Speaker 1: - Yep.

592
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,280
Speaker 1: - And is still crazy popular.

593
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:46,839
Speaker 0: - And after the TV series was off the air, applications to the police force in Japan skyrocketed.

594
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, so let's give a rundown on the whole thing 'cause it's not just a movie.

595
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:54,451
Speaker 1: - No, it's in 1997 and '98, there was, I think, whatever.

596
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,720
Speaker 0: - There was a TV series, it was a TV drama.

597
00:35:00,300 --> 00:35:01,439
Speaker 1: - Odoru Daiso Sase.

598
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,399
Speaker 0: - That's what started the whole thing.

599
00:35:03,680 --> 00:35:11,499
Speaker 1: - Now it's about a guy, Aoshima, who quits his job to join the police force because he's idealistic, he wants to make Japan a better place.

600
00:35:12,202 --> 00:35:16,460
Speaker 1: So he is working in this made up precinct somewhere, I think it's around Tokyo or in Tokyo.

601
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:20,140
Speaker 0: - Yeah, they make up the fictional Wangen precinct.

602
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,400
Speaker 0: Wangen, whatever, it doesn't matter.

603
00:35:23,980 --> 00:35:27,599
Speaker 1: - And he's idealistic, he's young, he's energetic, he wants to change the world.

604
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:32,220
Speaker 1: Problem is, the actual police force is no better than his corporate job.

605
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:50,840
Speaker 1: There's full of red tape and bureaucracy, civil servants that don't give a crap, his bosses are more concerned with keeping their jobs and saving face and looking good for the national police than they are actually fighting crime, and his hands are tied behind his back at every turn, a lot of people are incompetent, and it's just, it's a comedy.

606
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:57,960
Speaker 0: - Yeah, there's a lot of character drama going on, like there's the old detective who's smart and awesome, and there's the girl who's a girl.

607
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,075
Speaker 1: - Yep, and there's Moroi.

608
00:35:59,580 --> 00:36:02,399
Speaker 0: - It was Moroi who's the best character, even though he's not the main character.

609
00:36:03,240 --> 00:36:21,140
Speaker 1: - To put it in a perspective that would make sense to Americans, imagine if Aoshima, the main character, is like a beat cop on the street, and the old detective is like an old, retired, amazing detective in the US, and Moroi is like an FBI guy who comes in when big things happen, and he can't concern himself with the little stuff.

610
00:36:21,340 --> 00:36:29,220
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I think he used to be, I think the story of Moroi is that he was a little guy, but he was so good that he got pushed up into the ranks, and therefore is more awesome.

611
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:33,280
Speaker 1: - Yeah, see, we haven't actually seen the show, so we can't talk a lot about the backstory.

612
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:37,700
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we've only seen the two big movies, which is what we're gonna talk mostly about.

613
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:45,620
Speaker 1: - Bayside Shakedown, and then Bayside Shakedown II, Save the Rainbow Bridge, which was basically the exact same movie.

614
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:56,637
Speaker 0: - Yeah, anyway, after the show ended, there were a few special TV episodes, then the two big movies, and then in 2005, there were two spin-off movies, and that's it, that's all there is.

615
00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:04,080
Speaker 0: - Yep, for now at least, I mean, it's been, I mean, the last movie-- - It's been two years since they did anything, those spin-off movies, but they might do more.

616
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,820
Speaker 1: - It was two years between the second movie and the spin-off movies.

617
00:37:06,900 --> 00:37:08,119
Speaker 0: - That is true, that is true.

618
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,420
Speaker 1: - And apparently the show still sells really, really well on DVD over there.

619
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:27,600
Speaker 0: - Yeah, there was a DVD box set of the whole show I just saw on the internets on CD Japan, it was a lot of money, and it didn't have subtitles, it was region two box set, but it was really nice, and they said the DVD set came out in 2005, so, you know, hey, not bad.

620
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:54,240
Speaker 1: - But anyway, the pertinent information here is simply that you don't need to have seen any of the show or anything to appreciate the movie, because the movie is standalone, and while all of the character drama is there, and in fact, a lot of character drama from the show comes to a head, but yet they do it well enough to where you know exactly where everyone stands, and you don't know the exact backstory, but you know enough about who likes who, and who's with who, and what's going on, to enjoy it fully.

621
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:56,969
Speaker 0: - Yeah, so there are some inside jokes that you won't get.

622
00:37:57,090 --> 00:38:13,338
Speaker 0: if you watch the movie without seeing the show, such as there's the mascot of the police station, you won't know what the hell it is, but there was a whole episode about it, you just see it there in the movie, but it doesn't actually hurt your enjoyment of the movie, but it can enhance the enjoyment of the movie if you do know.

623
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,279
Speaker 1: - But you can't really get ahold of the show.

624
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,780
Speaker 0: - No, not in English, not easily in English.

625
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,279
Speaker 1: - Yes, the movie, however, you can just get.

626
00:38:19,641 --> 00:38:20,859
Speaker 1: It's in English, on DVD.

627
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:21,369
Speaker 1: - Yep.

628
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,999
Speaker 1: - Get it at any anime con, they always have it.

629
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:33,240
Speaker 0: - You can get it on the internet, it's pure Amazon and eBay, and just make sure you get a DVD with subtitles, we had one, it was at Video Barn, you can get one too, they exist.

630
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:36,740
Speaker 1: - Yes, they're also torrents periodically, because this movie is super popular.

631
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:40,640
Speaker 0: - Yeah, fifth biggest movie in Japan ever is gonna be a torrent somewhere.

632
00:38:41,320 --> 00:39:05,100
Speaker 1: - Now, I think what makes these movies, well this movie in particular, so amazing, before we get into a lot of the details, is simply that there's drama, and there's serious drama, and there are very, very poignant, amazing action moments, and it's a straight up action-packed thriller, but at the same time, it's a straight up laid back, goofy, pun-riddled, low comedy.

633
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:23,019
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I mean, dramedy is usually a bad word, but this isn't like all the dramedies that, the typical, stereotypical dramedies in the United States, you know, it's more like, it's not like a combination of drama and comedy, it's the two side by side, with not interfering with each other so much.

634
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:38,480
Speaker 1: - Yes, and while the plot, if you actually analyze it from way back, is not the most complex thing in the world, and there are a couple of, effectively, deus ex machinos coming around, the thing is, it's executed to the point that it'll take you along for the ride.

635
00:39:38,620 --> 00:39:39,880
Speaker 1: We kind of mentioned that in Brave Story.

636
00:39:40,261 --> 00:39:45,760
Speaker 1: It's so good, you'll just go along for the ride, accept everything at face value, and it's just awesome.

637
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:51,820
Speaker 0: - Yeah, a lot of it is kind of silly, like the detectiving, you're not getting the best detectiving action here.

638
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,960
Speaker 1: - It's Phoenix Wright level of detectiving.

639
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:56,840
Speaker 0: - It's a little better than Phoenix Wright level, but not much better.

640
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:06,359
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but the movie itself, this one specifically, is about, actually, I don't want to ruin anything about this movie, it's really hard to talk about it.

641
00:40:07,564 --> 00:40:08,339
Speaker 0: There's a crime.

642
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:10,219
Speaker 1: - Yes, well, here's the thing.

643
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:26,953
Speaker 1: The opening scene, I don't want to ruin this, but when we showed the movie, the opening scene happens, and the whole crowd in the anime club was like, wow, I didn't expect a movie to be like this, and the opening scene, the way it gets resolved, is so hilarious.

644
00:40:26,973 --> 00:40:27,500
Speaker 0: - With the golf?

645
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:28,559
Speaker 1: - And so amazing.

646
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:29,958
Speaker 0: - Is that the golf one in the car?

647
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:31,505
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

648
00:40:31,525 --> 00:40:32,051
Speaker 0: - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

649
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:34,455
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

650
00:40:34,475 --> 00:40:34,700
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

651
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:53,920
Speaker 0: - The second movie, actually, the second movie, the second movie is not as good as the first movie, but it's still good, but the opening bit of the second movie with the hostage situation on the boat with the guns is so awesome, oh my god, I think that was like the best scene in both movies combined.

652
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:57,339
Speaker 0: The beginning of the second movie is the best scene in the whole thing.

653
00:40:57,600 --> 00:41:04,080
Speaker 1: - I don't know, I think the die in the air scene and the (snores) scene.

654
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:09,140
Speaker 0: - Those are good ones, but I think the boat was way cool, 'cause it totally fools you right away.

655
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,899
Speaker 1: - It does, 'cause I was thinking, what the fuck?

656
00:41:11,241 --> 00:41:11,580
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

657
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:13,580
Speaker 1: And I didn't learn my lesson from the first movie.

658
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:14,394
Speaker 1: - Nope, not at all.

659
00:41:14,414 --> 00:41:14,660
Speaker 0: - At all.

660
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:15,920
Speaker 0: - I didn't learn it either.

661
00:41:16,182 --> 00:41:18,780
Speaker 0: I'm watching the second movie going, what the fuck's going on here?

662
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,899
Speaker 0: And then all of a sudden it's like, mother, oh, woo!

663
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:26,860
Speaker 1: - It takes a movie, a fucking movie, to fool you twice.

664
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,637
Speaker 0: - Fool me three times.

665
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,173
Speaker 1: - Can't fool me again.

666
00:41:31,193 --> 00:41:31,578
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

667
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:38,480
Speaker 1: - But long story short, a big name, a big shot, an important person gets kidnapped.

668
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:43,060
Speaker 1: And Aoshima is a beat cop, and they wanna solve the crime.

669
00:41:43,642 --> 00:41:50,299
Speaker 1: But at the same time, because it's a big crime, the high up Moroi and all the real cops, like the national awesome cops come in.

670
00:41:50,800 --> 00:42:05,700
Speaker 0: - And a lot of the drama of the movie is the big people at the top of the National Police Department of Japan, all the big time people running the investigation, they are all doing grumbly stuff that's not so good.

671
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:13,279
Speaker 0: And the guys who work on their feet, the actual cops, they know how to get this job done, and there's all sort of conflict between them.

672
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:16,519
Speaker 0: At the same time, they're trying to find the guy who did the crime.

673
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,318
Speaker 0: And aren't there some side crimes also?

674
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,066
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it seems to be.

675
00:42:19,127 --> 00:42:20,080
Speaker 1: both movies were like this.

676
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,820
Speaker 1: There's the main plot crime.

677
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:31,020
Speaker 1: But there are two, or actually I think there are three, pretty much unrelated threads of crime that are going on that they have to deal with independently of the main crime.

678
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:40,640
Speaker 0: - Yeah, usually all of the detective people will be looking to solve the big crime, but each one of them will have some sort of side crime they have to deal with.

679
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:45,040
Speaker 1: Like what was the one, the-- - Well, there's the crazy woman with the suicide thing.

680
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,540
Speaker 0: - Yeah, there was like a purse snatcher or something?

681
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,120
Speaker 0: What was it?

682
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:53,860
Speaker 0: - Well, there's the-- - That's right, someone was stealing things from the desks of people in the police department.

683
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:55,819
Speaker 1: - However, that one has a twist ending.

684
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:57,480
Speaker 0: - That one has a great twist ending.

685
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,020
Speaker 0: It's hilarious.

686
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,419
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna give that away at all.

687
00:42:59,560 --> 00:43:00,400
Speaker 1: - Oh, we can't give anything away.

688
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:01,559
Speaker 1: This movie is, ugh.

689
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:04,820
Speaker 0: - That's a big part of this movie is total surprises.

690
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,000
Speaker 0: It's like, huh, there's a mystery.

691
00:43:07,441 --> 00:43:11,920
Speaker 0: And you can kinda get some clues a little bit, but not so much, 'cause it's not a mystery show.

692
00:43:12,041 --> 00:43:13,200
Speaker 0: It's a comedy drama.

693
00:43:13,661 --> 00:43:15,599
Speaker 0: So mystery doesn't enter into it so much.

694
00:43:16,661 --> 00:43:19,460
Speaker 0: And then when it kindly resolves, surprise!

695
00:43:19,943 --> 00:43:20,777
Speaker 0: And you go, oh, shits!

696
00:43:21,282 --> 00:43:23,900
Speaker 0: And it's either "Lul" or "Oh My God" or both.

697
00:43:24,481 --> 00:43:31,419
Speaker 1: - Yes, this movie really is a kind of a rollercoaster of build you up and then hit you over the head with an awesome scene.

698
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:34,779
Speaker 1: And then build you up and hit you over the head with a more awesome scene.

699
00:43:35,281 --> 00:43:37,139
Speaker 1: You'll yell at the screen multiple times.

700
00:43:37,946 --> 00:43:40,460
Speaker 0: And I insist-- with people around.

701
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:42,480
Speaker 0: 'Cause watching it alone, you don't get the same effect.

702
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,940
Speaker 0: - The more people you have in the room with me-- - Oh, and you gotta turn the music up loud.

703
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:46,457
Speaker 0: - Yes.

704
00:43:47,620 --> 00:43:49,380
Speaker 0: - I think we've just demonstrated that enough.

705
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:50,279
Speaker 1: - I think we have.

706
00:43:51,121 --> 00:43:55,260
Speaker 1: Now we were talking about the big, national, fancy police versus the low beat police.

707
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:59,900
Speaker 1: And this seems to be a theme or a thread that is present in a lot of Japanese fiction.

708
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:03,879
Speaker 1: Where there's the person on the front lines, the person, like the grunt down there.

709
00:44:04,441 --> 00:44:05,999
Speaker 1: And he knows how to get the job done.

710
00:44:06,481 --> 00:44:09,379
Speaker 1: And he has to trust the people above him to make the right decisions.

711
00:44:10,061 --> 00:44:11,239
Speaker 1: And then there's the people at the top.

712
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:17,920
Speaker 1: Who have to, they have to make the right decisions because the things they do directly affect the people on the line.

713
00:44:17,980 --> 00:44:21,519
Speaker 1: And they rely on the people on the front lines to do things for them.

714
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:25,499
Speaker 1: But at the same time, they can't just walk all over those people or nothing will get done.

715
00:44:26,341 --> 00:44:31,796
Speaker 1: And it's this whole kind of, the bond between the low level salary man and the high level CEO.

716
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:33,820
Speaker 1: And how both of them are required.

717
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:36,020
Speaker 1: And how you have to have a balance between the two.

718
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:42,919
Speaker 1: And all these sorts of things that are really cool and poignant, but you don't need to worry about them if you don't care because there's also awesome, crazy, funny scenes.

719
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,500
Speaker 0: - It also has a little bit of sanctuary in it.

720
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:54,379
Speaker 0: You know, a sanctuary is all about, I'm in the mafia and you're in the government and we'll work together, you know, me on one side and you on the other side to, you know, set things right.

721
00:44:54,684 --> 00:45:03,220
Speaker 0: There's also-- - In Bayside Shankdown, they have the whole thing of, you know, we're friends, you go up the ladder and I'll stay here on the streets and we'll work together to set things right.

722
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:10,879
Speaker 1: - And there's this really cool plot of like, the friendship between Oshima and Moroi is really strained by this.

723
00:45:11,060 --> 00:45:15,579
Speaker 1: Because Moroi has to make decisions based on information that Oshima can't see.

724
00:45:16,181 --> 00:45:21,339
Speaker 1: And Moroi often has to make decisions that are painful or outright suck for reasons that he has no control over.

725
00:45:21,781 --> 00:45:23,300
Speaker 1: But those things still fuck Oshima.

726
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:29,199
Speaker 1: And he has, he trusts Moroi and he has to trust Moroi even when he thinks that Moroi is doing the wrong thing.

727
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,999
Speaker 1: Because his role is the grunt, doing what they say.

728
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:32,492
Speaker 0: - Yep.

729
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:37,160
Speaker 1: - Of course, he's also a troublemaker who never gets any sleep and can never go to the bathroom.

730
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,460
Speaker 0: - Oh yeah, there's all kinds of stuff like that.

731
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:47,900
Speaker 1: - Actually, one of my favorite scenes now that I'm thinking about that thread is remember the scene where-- - The vending machine in the-- - I was about to say the vending machines where-- - I always remember that one.

732
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:49,299
Speaker 0: I don't know if I like it so much.

733
00:45:49,541 --> 00:45:51,640
Speaker 0: It's a good scene, but it's not like my favorite.

734
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,539
Speaker 0: But I always remember it.

735
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,780
Speaker 1: - Well, the fact that the old detective was eavesdropping.

736
00:45:54,980 --> 00:45:57,919
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the old detective, I think, is my favorite character in the whole thing.

737
00:45:58,340 --> 00:46:01,259
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I mean, I like Oshima in the same way that I would like Ranma.

738
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:03,537
Speaker 1: It's just, like, he's the awesome, funny, oh my god.

739
00:46:03,558 --> 00:46:03,759
Speaker 1: guy.

740
00:46:04,202 --> 00:46:05,860
Speaker 1: But all the supporting cast are really good.

741
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:12,900
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the girl actually reminds me, like, Scully from X-Files, only less serious, and Japanese.

742
00:46:16,180 --> 00:46:21,880
Speaker 1: - Yeah, we've really avoided talking about the movie in any specific detail, because ruining this movie is a crime.

743
00:46:22,403 --> 00:46:24,800
Speaker 1: I mean, that's like ruining cowboy bebop for someone.

744
00:46:24,940 --> 00:46:25,858
Speaker 1: It's just, you can't do it.

745
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:26,639
Speaker 1: That's horrid.

746
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,960
Speaker 0: - The thing is, this is just not very well known outside of Japan, and it's awesome.

747
00:46:31,220 --> 00:46:33,460
Speaker 1: - Yes, I can't stress enough.

748
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:37,399
Speaker 1: I know we say this a lot about things, but that's just because we tend to review things we really like.

749
00:46:38,081 --> 00:46:40,560
Speaker 1: I guarantee you will like this movie.

750
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:41,839
Speaker 0: - If you are a human being.

751
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:51,360
Speaker 1: - If you do not like this movie, and you give us a valid reason, an actual valid reason, I mean, we'll probably play your critique on the show.

752
00:46:51,441 --> 00:46:59,199
Speaker 1: If you actually give us a good reason why you didn't like this movie, but you'd better be honest, because we'll know if you actually liked it, and you're just lying to get on the show.

753
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,720
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you could be just lying.

754
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:06,180
Speaker 1: - We'll know, because I've never met a human being who did not absolutely love this movie after they saw it.

755
00:47:06,420 --> 00:47:19,964
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I think one of the key things about this movie that makes it so great is, here in the United States, right, we have police shows, and the range of police shows seems to be on one end, we've got NYPD, Blue, and CSI, and all these serious, you know,

756
00:47:20,286 --> 00:47:20,790
Speaker 1: police,

757
00:47:21,696 --> 00:47:24,099
Speaker 0: we gotta figure out who did this horrible thing, we found 'em.

758
00:47:24,440 --> 00:47:25,360
Speaker 1: - We found 'em decapitated.

759
00:47:25,440 --> 00:47:28,194
Speaker 0: - It's all dark and gritty, and police procedural.

760
00:47:30,383 --> 00:47:32,479
Speaker 0: And on the other end, we have police academy.

761
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:33,096
Speaker 0: - God.

762
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:36,139
Speaker 0: - Or naked gun, and crap like that.

763
00:47:36,420 --> 00:47:38,579
Speaker 0: We don't have the in-between in the United States.

764
00:47:39,304 --> 00:47:40,000
Speaker 0: Can you think of one?

765
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:43,480
Speaker 1: - Not really, I can't think of any movie that's at all like this.

766
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:56,700
Speaker 0: - Every police, or detective, or even lawyer, there isn't so much loi-ing in Bayside Shakedown, or Doru Daisousasen, but it seems to either be really serious, or really wacky.

767
00:47:57,140 --> 00:48:03,840
Speaker 0: And this is way in between, it's got serious and silly, but not wacky silly, just normal silly.

768
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,979
Speaker 0: And it's awesome, super awesome.

769
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:08,859
Speaker 1: - Get this movie, watch it.

770
00:48:09,300 --> 00:48:14,839
Speaker 0: - Any way you can, if we find a link to somewhere, we should find a link to somewhere you can buy it, and put it in our little thingy.

771
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,559
Speaker 1: - We probably will do that, maybe not right away tonight, but at some point.

772
00:48:18,760 --> 00:48:30,959
Speaker 0: - Yeah, so go to frontrowcrew.com, either in the forum, you know what, yeah, in the forums, there will be probably a thread about the episode, and if we find a link to where you can buy it, we'll put all the different links up in there.

Speaker 0: - So go to the forums.

775
00:48:32,780 --> 00:48:36,940
Speaker 1: - And in fact, go to the forums anyway, 'cause the forums have recently exploded more so than ever.

776
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:39,437
Speaker 0: - Yeah, there's a lot of people talking about a lot of stuff in there.

777
00:48:39,477 --> 00:48:42,720
Speaker 0: now, it's like there's way more action going on than before.

778
00:48:42,940 --> 00:48:47,478
Speaker 1: - Yeah, the forums are to the point where I can't even keep up with them anymore, and I admin them.
