1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,977
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday November 22nd, and this is geek knives.

2
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,100
Speaker 1: tonight We talked about how we completely screwed off the first half of this podcast.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:24,339
Speaker 1: alright, so The first 20 minutes of this podcast are gone screwed up.

4
00:00:25,002 --> 00:00:32,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott in his infinite playing with his microphone Brushed the knobs on the mixer and turned my volume all the way up.

5
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,168
Speaker 0: Hey only part of the blame go to me.

6
00:00:34,389 --> 00:00:36,980
Speaker 0: part of the blame also must go to the knob and the wire.

7
00:00:37,623 --> 00:00:49,104
Speaker 1: All right, all right, but the point is the first 20 minutes of our banter Which we cannot replicate because it is absolutely impossible to Retalk about something.

8
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:54,580
Speaker 0: yep, but it was good, but it was loud loud loud, and I was normal.

9
00:00:54,841 --> 00:00:58,677
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm loud loud loud clipping loud and Scott is quiet quiet quiet.

10
00:00:59,019 --> 00:01:02,350
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, so it's kind of painful to listen to.

11
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:19,080
Speaker 0: but rather than deny you all the pleasure Hahaha, we we put it up completely unedited Completely unedited so that at least you get something out of it, and it's in a separate thing so we won't force it upon anyone.

12
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:26,498
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you really want to hear what we had to say Look in the comments on this week's podcast on the website, and you'll see a link to the bad mp3.

13
00:01:27,522 --> 00:01:31,376
Speaker 0: So we're just gonna jump right into our games bit because it's Tuesday, and it's games day.

14
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:31,456
Speaker 0: Yep.

15
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:37,120
Speaker 0: Yep, yep Ah So let's see video game action.

16
00:01:37,902 --> 00:01:38,825
Speaker 1: Well we picked up.

17
00:01:39,046 --> 00:01:42,176
Speaker 1: well I picked up for six dollars soul caliber - that was $12.

18
00:01:42,176 --> 00:01:44,145
Speaker 1: now It was six dollars.

19
00:01:44,346 --> 00:01:44,789
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

20
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:45,251
Speaker 0: It used to be 17.

21
00:01:45,251 --> 00:01:49,459
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Kind of balked at paying six bucks at first.

22
00:01:50,102 --> 00:01:53,636
Speaker 0: Well, I wouldn't balk at six bucks, and then I realized hey soul caliber.

23
00:01:53,656 --> 00:01:54,258
Speaker 1: I like that game.

24
00:01:54,559 --> 00:01:58,734
Speaker 0: Yeah It's an old game, but you know it's my second favorite fighting game ever.

25
00:01:58,834 --> 00:02:09,387
Speaker 0: second only to Bushido blade - I'm not a fan of the Bushido blade, but you're not good at him, and it's like even if I try to be good at him It's just even if I was good.

26
00:02:09,407 --> 00:02:11,212
Speaker 0: I mean it's a great concept.

27
00:02:11,252 --> 00:02:14,457
Speaker 0: you kill a guy with you know realness like you hit him with a sword he's dead.

28
00:02:15,684 --> 00:02:21,764
Speaker 0: but It ends up not being really fun to play because it ends up just being Kind of see.

29
00:02:21,784 --> 00:02:27,146
Speaker 1: it is really fun to play among people who are good because it's it's ching ching ching ching ching ching ching Ching ching ching ching ching ching ching.

30
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:29,119
Speaker 1: it takes about as long as a normal soul caliber battle.

31
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:32,091
Speaker 0: No, I've actually seen people who are good.

32
00:02:32,673 --> 00:02:41,200
Speaker 0: and the thing is is that If you take two of the like the two best Bushido blade guys in the world One of them is just better than the other and goes ding dead.

33
00:02:42,542 --> 00:02:44,350
Speaker 0: And while that's great very realistic.

34
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:49,874
Speaker 0: I mean you know for sword fighting I guess it's kind of boring and unfun.

35
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:55,592
Speaker 1: and yet you complain Incessantly while we play a soul caliber - about every aspect of that game.

36
00:02:55,632 --> 00:03:03,500
Speaker 0: see it's not so much so the problems with soul caliber - in Fact soul caliber - is terrific and that it solves most of the problems of other fighting games.

37
00:03:04,283 --> 00:03:11,638
Speaker 0: But the problem is is that there are problems inherent in the fighting game Period in every fighting game, and I disagree.

38
00:03:12,321 --> 00:03:17,896
Speaker 1: I think that fighting games as they are now are a genre and what you want is in a completely different genre.

39
00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:21,989
Speaker 0: I Don't think it's so much a completely different.

40
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:25,160
Speaker 1: I think it'll be especially the stupid things you've been suggesting.

41
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:27,509
Speaker 0: It's more like an evolution of the John.

42
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:32,713
Speaker 1: wasn't one of your suggestions that you want the map to be infinite So you can run away and hide behind a door and then hit someone.

43
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,039
Speaker 0: Yeah sure why not?

44
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,098
Speaker 1: That's a different kind of game.

45
00:03:36,946 --> 00:03:37,396
Speaker 0: Why so?

46
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:45,699
Speaker 1: fighting game is a genre of Gen of generally two-dimensional sometimes three-dimensional, but not really it doesn't really matter.

47
00:03:45,719 --> 00:03:52,018
Speaker 1: and It's just two people fighting two people engaging in various combinations of button pushing one of which will become the victor.

48
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:57,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah That's what it is fundamentally.

49
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:05,378
Speaker 0: But the way it translates on the screen Isn't all isn't always a hundred percent, and it kind of makes you go hurt.

50
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:06,863
Speaker 1: Only you.

51
00:04:06,883 --> 00:04:18,558
Speaker 0: well like when I see my sword go through someone and it doesn't actually register a hit or when you know some guy You know swings his sword like just above the bad guy's head.

52
00:04:18,598 --> 00:04:19,079
Speaker 0: It's like all right.

53
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,478
Speaker 0: You could have lowered it a little bit.

54
00:04:20,661 --> 00:04:23,373
Speaker 0: You know it's just a little but didn't remember.

55
00:04:23,494 --> 00:04:24,800
Speaker 1: in a fight you make a mistake.

56
00:04:25,423 --> 00:04:26,870
Speaker 1: How many kung-fu fights have you seen really?

57
00:04:26,911 --> 00:04:28,519
Speaker 1: I punches and then the other guy you know?

58
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:31,768
Speaker 0: Dodges and grabs his arm, but this isn't even like dodging.

59
00:04:31,788 --> 00:04:35,759
Speaker 0: This is just like dumbness and like other things like you know.

60
00:04:36,946 --> 00:04:37,355
Speaker 0: it's just.

61
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:45,645
Speaker 0: It's like you know when you're playing half-life right and you get this real immersion thing going on But you don't feel like you're playing a video game.

62
00:04:45,665 --> 00:05:01,250
Speaker 0: you feel like you're in half-life, and you're Gordon Freeman right and then you see like Some crate hanging off a crate in a non-possible way Or you see a guy in counter-strike standing on top of a door, and you're like all right It's a video game, and it kind of takes you out.

63
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:03,340
Speaker 0: You know so I guess I've never had that problem.

64
00:05:03,602 --> 00:05:09,060
Speaker 1: I mean when I get immersed in the game like half-life I get immersed fully and the game is consistent within itself.

65
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:13,114
Speaker 0: I just have life is really really great and not messing that or even counter-strike.

66
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:16,639
Speaker 1: when I see a guy jumping on a door that Makes perfect sense in counter-strike world

67
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:30,154
Speaker 0: but It's it's like there's this feeling and then it can be destroyed and broken by certain things in a game and For all fighting games seem to have this problem where you know it's not.

68
00:05:30,334 --> 00:05:32,480
Speaker 1: you know a game doesn't push ito blade.

69
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:35,626
Speaker 1: If the sword touches him he's dead.

70
00:05:36,328 --> 00:05:38,655
Speaker 0: I guess that's true, but that game's not fun.

71
00:05:38,675 --> 00:05:47,974
Speaker 0: Oh Revelation There's something we can do that's not Bushido blade that is not the standard fighting game.

72
00:05:47,994 --> 00:05:48,856
Speaker 0: That is also fun.

73
00:05:49,277 --> 00:05:55,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, well uh Produce it then because you keep saying oh it can be done But you never really come up with anything.

74
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:59,909
Speaker 1: because I think coming up with it is the hard part not even coming up with solid Concepts, I'm not saying make the game.

75
00:05:59,949 --> 00:06:01,740
Speaker 1: I'm saying just make the concept which you really haven't.

76
00:06:04,061 --> 00:06:08,388
Speaker 0: You control a guy the guy can do Any move.

77
00:06:08,489 --> 00:06:10,079
Speaker 0: the other person is any move.

78
00:06:10,581 --> 00:06:14,720
Speaker 1: How do you translate any move into a combination of button presses on a controller?

79
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:25,478
Speaker 0: well you you the button presses that we really abstracts like a is punch and Depending on the position of your guy and the position of the enemy the punch is determined.

80
00:06:25,879 --> 00:06:30,000
Speaker 1: wait So you mean you want it all to be determined by the game and not by what I do to the controller.

81
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:35,940
Speaker 1: Well, no, so I hit I determine I hit a and then my character does whatever punch is appropriate.

82
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:40,585
Speaker 0: It's not whatever pun It's it's not a hundred percent.

83
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:43,755
Speaker 0: Just you know always he throws the perfect punch, and it hits.

84
00:06:43,836 --> 00:06:45,120
Speaker 0: then why there's more to it?

85
00:06:45,220 --> 00:07:03,840
Speaker 0: It's like it would be a game more of positioning yourself because you know what punch he'll throw Depending on what you're doing otherwise like oh, I'll you know jump off the wall and I'll you know or I'll go through the window or climb up the ladder and drop down on him and throw a punch or something like.

86
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:09,320
Speaker 0: Or wait till he ducks and then jump and throw a punch because I'll do a different move if that happens.

87
00:07:09,521 --> 00:07:12,080
Speaker 1: That doesn't sound any different than Soul Calibur.

88
00:07:13,861 --> 00:07:16,732
Speaker 1: Because Soul Calibur you think you you see always in that stance.

89
00:07:16,752 --> 00:07:17,817
Speaker 1: He can do any of these moves.

90
00:07:18,178 --> 00:07:20,973
Speaker 1: all right I'll do this move they don't be able to counter and then oh, but

91
00:07:21,295 --> 00:07:31,796
Speaker 0: it's a lot more complicated in the button pressing it to memorize all these button presses and It's it's very complicated and unless you're like a fight you have to be a fighting game master to really

92
00:07:31,977 --> 00:07:33,040
Speaker 1: actually what I've done.

93
00:07:33,441 --> 00:07:35,146
Speaker 1: I'm not great at the game, but I'm pretty good.

94
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,751
Speaker 1: You know I only play voldo.

95
00:07:37,092 --> 00:07:39,820
Speaker 1: Don't ask why I'm terrible at most fighting games.

96
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,929
Speaker 1: But when I picked up Soul Calibur, and I use voldo.

97
00:07:41,949 --> 00:07:42,471
Speaker 1: I'm pretty good.

98
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:44,480
Speaker 0: It's scary voldo scary.

99
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,223
Speaker 0: Why voldo?

100
00:07:45,664 --> 00:07:47,270
Speaker 1: and why couldn't it been a cute girl now?

101
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,812
Speaker 1: It's voldo.

102
00:07:47,832 --> 00:07:50,080
Speaker 0: Hey you you should have picked a cute girl.

103
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,905
Speaker 0: I never played voldo.

104
00:07:50,925 --> 00:07:54,363
Speaker 1: I did I played I played Rafael and all these people all the time And I always lost.

105
00:07:54,965 --> 00:07:58,498
Speaker 1: and then I played voldo one time and I started actually beating people a lot.

106
00:07:58,518 --> 00:08:13,998
Speaker 1: yeah But like I don't know the specific button combinations But I have this general sense that I've picked up in my brain of like Voldo standing a certain way, and you're standing there, and I just think to myself I want to do a move kind of like this, and it just comes out

107
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,101
Speaker 0: Yeah,

108
00:08:15,623 --> 00:08:16,689
Speaker 1: it's all very my brain.

109
00:08:16,729 --> 00:08:18,600
Speaker 1: I don't specifically think it's like you're playing DDR.

110
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:21,174
Speaker 1: You don't think down left down left down left up.

111
00:08:21,536 --> 00:08:25,131
Speaker 1: you just think Arrows are going in my eyes, and they're coming out my feet.

112
00:08:25,332 --> 00:08:33,340
Speaker 0: the problem is generally you want to make a game Where the higher level of skill you have then the more you will win and the less skill you have the more you will lose.

113
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:34,495
Speaker 1: That's how fighting games are.

114
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:44,600
Speaker 0: Soul caliber not really the guy with less skill who button mashes can often beat people with a Small a lot slightly larger amount of skill or slightly larger.

115
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:46,528
Speaker 1: That's effectively negligibly large.

116
00:08:46,549 --> 00:08:49,080
Speaker 0: they can also beat people with a medium amount of skill.

117
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,096
Speaker 0: It's only the people you know insane fighting game skills that can win consistently.

118
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:59,660
Speaker 1: see I Don't think you have much evidence of that because none of us are good at Soul Calibur.

119
00:09:00,142 --> 00:09:02,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are people who are good, and they still.

120
00:09:02,811 --> 00:09:05,460
Speaker 1: you know when was the last time we played with someone who was good?

121
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:14,968
Speaker 0: I played against a crazy obsessive fanboy at an anime club social night and all I did was button mash and I beat him.

122
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,059
Speaker 1: How do you know he was good?

123
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,139
Speaker 0: Because he whupped like ten people in a row.

124
00:09:21,522 --> 00:09:23,239
Speaker 1: That's not that scientific you know.

125
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:25,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, y'all James Randi.

126
00:09:25,972 --> 00:09:27,039
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be all James alright.

127
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:31,120
Speaker 0: So I guess we're not gonna be able to settle this until we find the Soul Calibur 2 grandmaster.

128
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

129
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:41,900
Speaker 1: And then see if he can beat my close my eyes and hit a bunch of buttons with a Waldo technique And if he can't I guess that's a problem, and if he can all right.

130
00:09:43,361 --> 00:09:49,660
Speaker 0: But you know the thing is if you ace me if you just smash buttons you can beat people with a medium amount of skill.

131
00:09:49,921 --> 00:09:52,919
Speaker 0: You know kind of know what they're doing just because the way the game works.

132
00:09:54,321 --> 00:09:55,305
Speaker 1: See I don't see that so much.

133
00:09:55,366 --> 00:10:02,080
Speaker 1: most of the people I see who the people who button mash who I watched tend to never Win I but rarely win very a lot.

134
00:10:03,162 --> 00:10:04,070
Speaker 1: You don't win that often.

135
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:05,199
Speaker 0: What are you talking about?

136
00:10:06,661 --> 00:10:08,949
Speaker 1: It's more that you just don't give up the controller when you lose.

137
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:14,018
Speaker 0: no excuse me excuse me Heads not it at all.

138
00:10:18,431 --> 00:10:19,190
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah.

139
00:10:20,111 --> 00:10:23,424
Speaker 1: So we played a lot of board games this past weekend.

140
00:10:23,946 --> 00:10:32,950
Speaker 1: Oh board games I miss be and I figured we just talked about all the board games We played because they're our favorite board games, and it's gaming night, and there's no more video game.

141
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:35,038
Speaker 0: Well, we didn't play one of our favorite board games.

142
00:10:35,118 --> 00:10:37,165
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're done with that game for now.

143
00:10:37,226 --> 00:10:43,969
Speaker 0: kind of yeah It's kind of like you know you might have a Megaman 2 is the greatest video game, but you don't see me playing it too often.

144
00:10:44,292 --> 00:10:45,138
Speaker 0: It's a little played out.

145
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:46,488
Speaker 0: Puerto Rico's the same way.

146
00:10:46,891 --> 00:10:51,590
Speaker 0: I'm so great, but it's kind of played out and there's no two players.

147
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:54,743
Speaker 1: So and we really got no more video games to talk about.

148
00:10:54,763 --> 00:10:57,856
Speaker 1: unless you want us to talk more about Mario Kart Which we're playing incessantly.

149
00:10:57,876 --> 00:11:00,669
Speaker 0: I got some good time trial action going on.

150
00:11:00,729 --> 00:11:05,544
Speaker 0: now I'm gonna pretty much do time trials and online play from now on considering.

151
00:11:05,564 --> 00:11:07,490
Speaker 0: I beat all the GPS with God.

152
00:11:10,181 --> 00:11:10,410
Speaker 0: Yeah.

153
00:11:11,335 --> 00:11:18,269
Speaker 0: So the board games we started out with a little teeny Tigris and Euphrates, which is currently my favorite board game.

154
00:11:18,731 --> 00:11:21,663
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely currently the hot game to play.

155
00:11:21,684 --> 00:11:25,989
Speaker 0: I could play it pretty much all night And I don't think I get tired of it without like a hundred more plays.

156
00:11:26,513 --> 00:11:35,050
Speaker 1: See tigers and Euphrates is a very open game And there is other than the tiles you draw in your hand which is just an aspect of the game.

157
00:11:35,412 --> 00:11:41,050
Speaker 1: There is absolutely no randomness whatsoever Anything that happens in the game was caused by another player directly.

158
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:51,790
Speaker 0: Of course, you know the what tiles you draw is kind of random and kind of really important But except it's the only bit is the only thing and you're the only one who's ever complained about not getting the tiles you needed.

159
00:11:52,652 --> 00:11:53,499
Speaker 1: I'm not lying.

160
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,427
Speaker 0: I swear to God.

161
00:11:54,588 --> 00:11:57,972
Speaker 0: my Beginning of the game I drew one red On.

162
00:11:58,012 --> 00:12:01,847
Speaker 0: the very last tile I drew out of the bag was my second red tile.

163
00:12:02,068 --> 00:12:07,209
Speaker 0: you could have Know I could have thrown out all my tiles and drawn six new ones, right?

164
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,957
Speaker 0: But I just don't feel good doing that.

165
00:12:09,977 --> 00:12:10,599
Speaker 0: Yeah.

166
00:12:10,941 --> 00:12:11,905
Speaker 1: Well great.

167
00:12:12,366 --> 00:12:13,089
Speaker 1: That was great for me.

168
00:12:13,792 --> 00:12:16,482
Speaker 0: I won the first game though pretty well to with.

169
00:12:16,542 --> 00:12:21,061
Speaker 1: I won the second game handily Yeah by an order of magnitude.

170
00:12:21,181 --> 00:12:29,241
Speaker 0: I just ran for those monuments and bam It's nice Like I'm like how we used to never put out the monuments.

171
00:12:29,281 --> 00:12:32,093
Speaker 0: or maybe we'd put out a monument and then fight over it Ferociously.

172
00:12:32,113 --> 00:12:36,589
Speaker 0: now like every monument comes out It's crazy.

173
00:12:37,091 --> 00:12:38,736
Speaker 1: So T&E is a very open game.

174
00:12:38,997 --> 00:12:45,115
Speaker 1: Basically you place tiles on a board and you can place them anywhere on the board pretty much And you have little leaders.

175
00:12:45,155 --> 00:12:52,802
Speaker 1: you can place them anywhere and you're building little kingdoms and fighting with each other over Monuments and victory points and the game has a really cool gimmick.

176
00:12:52,982 --> 00:12:55,310
Speaker 1: every game that we like has some kind of gimmick.

177
00:12:55,410 --> 00:12:56,977
Speaker 1: It's like you describe the game.

178
00:12:57,017 --> 00:12:58,363
Speaker 1: You're like, yeah, but what's the gimmick?

179
00:12:58,423 --> 00:12:59,950
Speaker 1: and then someone says the gimmick and you go whoo?

180
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:10,284
Speaker 1: This game's gimmick is there are four different colors of victory points that you get and your final score is The lowest of the four that you have.

181
00:13:10,505 --> 00:13:11,509
Speaker 0: it's the most least.

182
00:13:12,193 --> 00:13:12,896
Speaker 0: That's how you win.

183
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:15,710
Speaker 0: is you have the most of the least color of point.

184
00:13:17,311 --> 00:13:29,187
Speaker 0: So if you got three green ten red ten black and ten blue and the other guy has four of everything He wins because your score is three because you all your most least is three.

185
00:13:29,207 --> 00:13:32,285
Speaker 0: Yep The other guy has he's got four.

186
00:13:32,486 --> 00:13:34,417
Speaker 0: so ha You could also think of.

187
00:13:34,437 --> 00:13:37,170
Speaker 0: it is getting sets like how many sets do you have?

188
00:13:38,070 --> 00:13:41,849
Speaker 0: But it's it's technically the most least because technically they both work.

189
00:13:42,171 --> 00:13:46,346
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but if there's a tie for most least you look at the second lowest.

190
00:13:46,426 --> 00:13:47,390
Speaker 0: so that's not sets.

191
00:13:47,691 --> 00:13:50,061
Speaker 1: No, all you do in that case is you eliminate your lowest color.

192
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:50,944
Speaker 1: then you do sets again.

193
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:51,948
Speaker 0: That's true.

194
00:13:53,651 --> 00:13:57,463
Speaker 1: Anyway, we also played a lot of a little bit not so much st.

195
00:13:57,523 --> 00:13:58,285
Speaker 1: Petersburg.

196
00:13:58,606 --> 00:13:58,787
Speaker 0: st.

197
00:13:58,827 --> 00:14:03,085
Speaker 0: Petersburg is good But I don't see a lot of a variation in the game.

198
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:04,190
Speaker 1: It's a really fun game.

199
00:14:04,351 --> 00:14:06,349
Speaker 1: It's basically a growth management game.

200
00:14:06,671 --> 00:14:12,193
Speaker 1: You buy workers to get money and then you use the money to get victory points and you have to balance money and victory points Throughout the whole game.

201
00:14:12,494 --> 00:14:12,654
Speaker 0: Yep.

202
00:14:13,217 --> 00:14:24,360
Speaker 1: It's pretty much perfect except for one glaring problem Whereby if one of the big aristocrats comes out the judge Judge of the mistress comes out in the first round.

203
00:14:24,661 --> 00:14:26,670
Speaker 1: whoever buys it pretty much wins automatically.

204
00:14:27,173 --> 00:14:30,733
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is sometimes that the guy plays poorly It's.

205
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:38,224
Speaker 0: I think there's the one balancing against that is if you buy a Kremlin the first turn You stand to get a lot of points out of that Kremlin.

206
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:43,370
Speaker 1: Not really Well buying a Kremlin the first turn is almost always suicide.

207
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,879
Speaker 0: It's because you lose all this money and the.

208
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:54,655
Speaker 0: but the thing is is if then one of the big Jews The big aristocrats comes out Yeah, we call them the Jews.

209
00:14:55,036 --> 00:14:57,485
Speaker 0: yeah, see I'm not silly with a German board game.

210
00:14:57,645 --> 00:14:59,010
Speaker 0: don't even guess we are silly.

211
00:14:59,071 --> 00:14:59,758
Speaker 1: I mean you there.

212
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,589
Speaker 1: they are workers buildings aristocrats and upgrades.

213
00:15:05,253 --> 00:15:15,507
Speaker 1: But we call them workers or I don't know Proletarians or we make jokes like all the workers, but yeah Yeah, and then we got Kremlin's because the icon is shaped like a Kremlin because it's a Russian games.

214
00:15:15,547 --> 00:15:19,603
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's Berg Yeah, and the upgrades just squares.

215
00:15:19,844 --> 00:15:28,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the Jews are the aristocrats Yep, because the the tile that represents them is this pointy nose guy, and I'll point out that Scott here is Jewish.

216
00:15:28,891 --> 00:15:30,645
Speaker 1: So yeah, so it's okay.

217
00:15:30,907 --> 00:15:33,418
Speaker 0: We're not Anti-semite, so we're just.

218
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,009
Speaker 0: hey, Jerry racism eggs overcooked.

219
00:15:36,551 --> 00:15:42,189
Speaker 0: Anti-semitism racism is funny when it's not real And it's just words.

220
00:15:43,004 --> 00:15:43,290
Speaker 1: NASA.

221
00:15:44,114 --> 00:15:46,085
Speaker 1: Sorry, that is definitely an inside joke.

222
00:15:46,386 --> 00:15:47,110
Speaker 0: It is coal.

223
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,056
Speaker 0: so The Problem I have with st.

224
00:15:52,097 --> 00:15:56,580
Speaker 0: Petersburg is that it's a lot of fun to play But there's not a lot of variations pretty much.

225
00:15:56,922 --> 00:15:58,829
Speaker 0: You know you buy workers you buy Kremlin's.

226
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:01,221
Speaker 1: Yeah, once you get down to it the game becomes.

227
00:16:01,482 --> 00:16:02,950
Speaker 1: it's no longer a game of playing the game.

228
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:16,388
Speaker 1: It's a game of either odd evening which is you take a card now to ensure that you will be able to get a card in the next phase or I don't take a card now to make sure that my opponent does not get a card in the next phase.

229
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:24,650
Speaker 1: yep Or The only other real aspect is when do you turn from making money to making victory points and whoever does it first?

230
00:16:24,771 --> 00:16:25,908
Speaker 1: But not too early will win.

231
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:28,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you do too early you won't have enough money, and you'll be stuck.

232
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:35,469
Speaker 0: But if you do it too late the other guy gets more victory points than you because he bought something a turn earlier And it ended up generating in more points.

233
00:16:35,731 --> 00:16:40,427
Speaker 1: It's a good beginner to intermediate game, and it's really fun, and we still play it, but it'll get old.

234
00:16:40,688 --> 00:16:41,310
Speaker 0: it will get old.

235
00:16:42,671 --> 00:16:46,730
Speaker 0: The other thing is I noticed that a lot of other board game people want to hear them talk about board games.

236
00:16:47,374 --> 00:16:49,849
Speaker 0: They seem to only play a game like a few times a year.

237
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:55,522
Speaker 0: God we Also play a lot more games in total.

238
00:16:55,562 --> 00:16:57,170
Speaker 0: they have all just a huge variety.

239
00:16:57,692 --> 00:17:02,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a lot of games a whole lot because we only buy that like the best best games.

240
00:17:02,410 --> 00:17:03,196
Speaker 1: Then we play them out.

241
00:17:03,418 --> 00:17:09,723
Speaker 1: Yep like when we bought Puerto Rico We the three of us played Puerto Rico one weekend.

242
00:17:09,743 --> 00:17:11,290
Speaker 1: We played it like 15 times in one day.

243
00:17:11,329 --> 00:17:12,474
Speaker 1: We just played it constantly.

244
00:17:12,555 --> 00:17:13,057
Speaker 0: It was great.

245
00:17:13,659 --> 00:17:15,265
Speaker 1: like we'd play it someone would win.

246
00:17:15,546 --> 00:17:16,470
Speaker 1: We'd sit there for a second.

247
00:17:16,530 --> 00:17:18,964
Speaker 1: We'd argue for a while about oh you won because of this.

248
00:17:19,126 --> 00:17:19,730
Speaker 1: oh blah blah blah.

249
00:17:19,871 --> 00:17:20,762
Speaker 1: I didn't notice that.

250
00:17:21,047 --> 00:17:31,050
Speaker 1: yeah And then we just play again and again and again and again and one of us to go to work and come back and play Again, those are good days good days, and we still do that whenever our friends come over.

251
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:32,738
Speaker 1: We play board games pretty much non-stop.

252
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:33,541
Speaker 0: Just make a stack.

253
00:17:33,561 --> 00:17:35,108
Speaker 0: We play the top right to the bottom.

254
00:17:35,349 --> 00:17:40,390
Speaker 1: yep Some games get neglected now like settlers, but it's gonna be all good.

255
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:40,973
Speaker 0: I just order.

256
00:17:41,013 --> 00:17:43,284
Speaker 0: I find there isn't a game store around anymore.

257
00:17:43,324 --> 00:17:44,490
Speaker 0: Well there is but it's not so good.

258
00:17:44,671 --> 00:17:45,654
Speaker 1: No, it's no millennium.

259
00:17:45,775 --> 00:17:51,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I am gonna go there this weekend because supposedly there's gonna be some gamers there and I'll try to get a game on with them.

260
00:17:51,356 --> 00:17:56,076
Speaker 0: maybe I can get some more consistent games on with them and Because we need players.

261
00:17:56,437 --> 00:18:03,061
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we don't have a game store that sells a high Quantity of the in selection of the German games that we like.

262
00:18:03,563 --> 00:18:10,105
Speaker 0: so finally I decided to bite the the bullet And I bought some games online at this website game fest calm.

263
00:18:10,687 --> 00:18:11,510
Speaker 0: It's a good website.

264
00:18:12,074 --> 00:18:24,690
Speaker 0: They had a whole big selection of games And they told you how many of each they had in stock left and a lot of the games were either out of stock Or they had single-digit numbers of copies, so I imagine it's just a game store somewhere that has a nice website.

265
00:18:25,552 --> 00:18:28,470
Speaker 0: There was another one that had a good website fun again calm.

266
00:18:29,152 --> 00:18:31,641
Speaker 0: they seemed like a you know pretty much equal like.

267
00:18:32,042 --> 00:18:45,890
Speaker 0: it was completely arbitrary which one I bought from and The only thing that made me choose game fest was the site was a little bit cleaner a little bit more trustworthy looking and The price was like lower by a dollar on one game.

268
00:18:46,610 --> 00:18:48,617
Speaker 0: Huh so yeah, that'll do it.

269
00:18:49,199 --> 00:18:52,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm driving to Rochester this weekend.

270
00:18:52,634 --> 00:18:57,628
Speaker 1: I'll definitely be stopping in Millennium Which is one of the biggest game stores in America might be the biggest.

271
00:18:57,869 --> 00:19:01,526
Speaker 0: yeah I'm gonna get me some board games definitely the best that I've ever been to or seen.

272
00:19:01,666 --> 00:19:03,716
Speaker 0: yeah of course There is one in the city somewhere.

273
00:19:03,736 --> 00:19:04,560
Speaker 0: I just have to find it.

274
00:19:05,424 --> 00:19:06,630
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go to it one of these days.

275
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:07,433
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll go Friday.

276
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,076
Speaker 0: I don't know huh.

277
00:19:08,217 --> 00:19:08,819
Speaker 0: I'll think about it.

278
00:19:09,884 --> 00:19:11,410
Speaker 1: We also played some Alhambra.

279
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:17,098
Speaker 1: Alhambra is always a good game deserving its feel this yeah It's a bidding game and a tile placement game.

280
00:19:17,399 --> 00:19:19,406
Speaker 1: not a tile laying game, but a tile placement game.

281
00:19:19,547 --> 00:19:20,410
Speaker 0: It's not really bidding.

282
00:19:21,390 --> 00:19:23,957
Speaker 0: It's more of a take money buy stuff.

283
00:19:24,218 --> 00:19:30,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you cut if you keep track of the money people are drawing in their hands Which is very easy to do.

284
00:19:30,677 --> 00:19:32,246
Speaker 0: it's like oh look rim took all the blue money.

285
00:19:32,286 --> 00:19:35,707
Speaker 0: I wonder yeah once Oh, could it be that tile that's on the blue space?

286
00:19:37,492 --> 00:19:42,799
Speaker 1: This game has a gimmick like every game and the gimmick is You don't get change back when you buy something.

287
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,813
Speaker 0: so if you spend if you do something cost ten and all you have is two Nines.

288
00:19:47,335 --> 00:19:53,366
Speaker 0: guess what you spent if you want to buy it right now You got to spend the two nines, and you don't get eight back.

289
00:19:53,648 --> 00:19:58,245
Speaker 1: yep But other gimmick is if you do buy something with exact change you get another action.

290
00:19:58,666 --> 00:19:59,770
Speaker 0: that is very powerful.

291
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:02,989
Speaker 0: People who basically the winner is the person who both?

292
00:20:03,611 --> 00:20:16,960
Speaker 0: buys things that are that they need while also saving money and not buying useless things and Buying everything as much as possible with exact change in order to get free turns though You can't forget buying the things other people need to deny them points.

293
00:20:17,462 --> 00:20:19,509
Speaker 1: of course it also has a nice mechanic.

294
00:20:19,549 --> 00:20:19,730
Speaker 1: where?

295
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,723
Speaker 1: Games where ties can occur within the game have a number numerous ways of dealing with that.

296
00:20:25,084 --> 00:20:36,170
Speaker 1: some games are everybody loses meaning if there's a tie You either no one gets anything or you divide up everything like among the winners mm-hmm and Alhambra is one of those.

297
00:20:36,731 --> 00:20:41,485
Speaker 1: So say first place is something's worth 15 points and second place is worth six points.

298
00:20:41,966 --> 00:20:49,790
Speaker 1: if three people tie for first place They divide 15 points by three and then the second place person actually gets more points than the first place person.

299
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:55,327
Speaker 0: Yeah, it basically if that mechanic right there is what makes it a multi-person game.

300
00:20:55,367 --> 00:21:04,630
Speaker 0: without that mechanic It's basically just a race to see who can get the most points the least amount of time based on the random Coming out of tiles and coming out of money cards.

301
00:21:04,713 --> 00:21:10,056
Speaker 0: Yeah That mechanic actually forces you to look at what other people have When deciding what tiles to buy.

302
00:21:10,076 --> 00:21:13,909
Speaker 0: if first second and third play at first and second place are already locked in.

303
00:21:14,692 --> 00:21:26,010
Speaker 0: It's really a waste of money to spend things on the third place to get a tile to tie for third place when you could You know wait for the next tile to come buy that and get something something other color.

304
00:21:26,111 --> 00:21:32,710
Speaker 1: yep, unless you're a Rival, you can tie him in something to take points away from him or there's a bunch of things you can do.

305
00:21:32,911 --> 00:21:38,550
Speaker 0: There is of course one thing that you know Always kind of messes you up in the game is that if you keep looking at the colors?

306
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:42,450
Speaker 0: Deciding what tiles to buy and what not to you kind of ignore the walls.

307
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,929
Speaker 0: You have to pay attention to the walls, too.

308
00:21:44,051 --> 00:21:50,950
Speaker 0: You might not need a tile But if it has good walls on it and it fits nicely in your Alhambra you can get a bunch of extra points from it.

309
00:21:51,452 --> 00:21:55,390
Speaker 0: So you don't want to like, you know, leave anything out with more than you know.

310
00:21:56,312 --> 00:21:58,745
Speaker 1: Yeah, our friend Pete has a problem.

311
00:21:58,765 --> 00:22:02,209
Speaker 1: whenever he builds an Alhambra He tends to wall himself in completely and then he's screwed.

312
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:05,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to build the Alhambra nicely a lot of times.

313
00:22:05,790 --> 00:22:09,446
Speaker 0: They'll be like the perfect tile but nowhere to put it in your Alhambra then you're done.

314
00:22:09,627 --> 00:22:10,009
Speaker 0: forget it.

315
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:13,890
Speaker 1: now It's a great game, but the box lies when it says it's two to six players.

316
00:22:14,392 --> 00:22:15,437
Speaker 1: It's three to six players.

317
00:22:15,678 --> 00:22:20,495
Speaker 1: If you play with two players, it adds this like Deterministic player named Matt.

318
00:22:20,977 --> 00:22:22,100
Speaker 0: It's like playing blackjack.

319
00:22:22,522 --> 00:22:23,084
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

320
00:22:23,244 --> 00:22:23,645
Speaker 1: Don't play.

321
00:22:23,746 --> 00:22:24,849
Speaker 0: always know what dealers gonna do.

322
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,197
Speaker 0: You always know what Matt's gonna do.

323
00:22:26,217 --> 00:22:28,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, it never wins unless you're dumb.

324
00:22:28,851 --> 00:22:31,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, the first time we ever played Matt almost beat us.

325
00:22:31,439 --> 00:22:34,649
Speaker 0: It's kind of like playing risk with that neutral army out there only worse.

326
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:37,180
Speaker 1: Of course we played.

327
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,490
Speaker 1: I mean this was a game where everybody loses in ties.

328
00:22:39,851 --> 00:22:42,258
Speaker 1: We played another game where everybody wins on a tie.

329
00:22:42,279 --> 00:22:44,124
Speaker 1: I'm on ray.

330
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:45,930
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a fun game.

331
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:47,515
Speaker 1: It's probably my second favorite game, right?

332
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:50,706
Speaker 0: I realize that most of our games are Rainier Canizia games.

333
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:51,850
Speaker 1: They're awesome games.

334
00:22:52,432 --> 00:22:53,435
Speaker 0: He's a great game making.

335
00:22:53,876 --> 00:22:56,385
Speaker 1: I'm on array is a really neat mechanic as well.

336
00:22:56,445 --> 00:22:59,236
Speaker 1: It's a. it's a diminishing returns.

337
00:22:59,316 --> 00:23:06,001
Speaker 1: buy things bid but bid in a weird way By sacrificing things to the gods or stealing from the gods.

338
00:23:06,523 --> 00:23:15,690
Speaker 1: stealing from the gods was very key but the mechanic here the the gimmick is that You build a bunch of stuff on the board and you play the game all the way through and you score.

339
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:23,369
Speaker 1: Then if the flood comes and wipes everything out except the pyramids that everyone is built and you lose everything you have other than that Everything on the board goes away.

340
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:26,882
Speaker 1: Then you play the whole game again and the board starts the way it left.

341
00:23:27,324 --> 00:23:28,609
Speaker 1: it ended at the previous round.

342
00:23:29,851 --> 00:23:32,806
Speaker 0: It's really cool because what ends up happening is in the first round.

343
00:23:32,886 --> 00:23:33,650
Speaker 0: play is obvious.

344
00:23:34,051 --> 00:23:39,689
Speaker 0: It's easy to tell which ones are the best and which ones aren't the best to go for and you can just bid on the best provinces.

345
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:46,685
Speaker 0: You know how much money you have and how much you can afford to bid and everyone gets exactly what they deserve based on the order of play and such.

346
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:56,901
Speaker 0: But in the second round You know some guy who didn't spend a lot of money for his province that he didn't pay for in the first round But built like two pyramids on it.

347
00:23:57,303 --> 00:24:06,129
Speaker 0: and now in the second round Someone has to decide between a good province with maybe one pyramid and a crappy province with like many many pyramids.

348
00:24:07,151 --> 00:24:14,738
Speaker 1: Yep, I've often found my strategies lean towards if I have a choice if I have a crappy Province while I'm playing in the first round.

349
00:24:14,999 --> 00:24:17,690
Speaker 1: I'll put all my pyramids there and screw someone in the next round.

350
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:22,808
Speaker 0: I basically try to get the best province I possibly can every time.

351
00:24:22,828 --> 00:24:24,802
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, I can afford.

352
00:24:24,923 --> 00:24:28,589
Speaker 1: so uh Yeah, I try to win every game that I play.

353
00:24:30,232 --> 00:24:32,081
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's you know, what can I do besides?

354
00:24:32,302 --> 00:24:33,770
Speaker 0: go for the best province possible?

355
00:24:34,590 --> 00:24:40,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the thing is the way the bidding works is it's like you can't fake out and bid on something crappy and then move To something good.

356
00:24:41,076 --> 00:24:43,590
Speaker 0: You have to pretty much go for what you're gonna go for.

357
00:24:43,731 --> 00:24:45,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you're gonna fake someone out.

358
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:46,329
Speaker 1: you have to be devious in it.

359
00:24:46,811 --> 00:24:48,296
Speaker 0: It's it's real hard to fake someone out.

360
00:24:48,316 --> 00:24:52,170
Speaker 0: You'd have to go for like the second best province at a low price.

361
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:56,227
Speaker 0: Hope that someone out bids you and then go to the best province at a higher price.

362
00:24:56,267 --> 00:25:02,590
Speaker 1: Yeah The bidding is definitely fun because you get you can sacrifice to the gods or you can steal from the gods temple and get money.

363
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:10,950
Speaker 0: Yeah I think that the problem is is that if everyone Depending the provinces that come out that determines if people are gonna steal or bid to the gods.

364
00:25:11,613 --> 00:25:15,129
Speaker 0: And I remember in early games we used to bid to the gods a lot and we go way up.

365
00:25:15,853 --> 00:25:24,764
Speaker 0: But now everyone seems to kind of screw the gods and steal all their money Which is great because that means I give to the gods and the gods give me nice things Yeah, then I also give to the gods.

366
00:25:25,046 --> 00:25:25,790
Speaker 0: I remember one game.

367
00:25:25,850 --> 00:25:28,607
Speaker 0: I just got first place every time and everyone else kept stealing it all.

368
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:30,830
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, that won that game pretty easily.

369
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:45,081
Speaker 0: But I think that if we played a game where you know different tile the order of tiles came out to where that everyone wanted to give more to the gods that we'd see a crazy high point scoring game as Opposed to the low point scoring games we have now.

370
00:25:45,382 --> 00:25:46,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we had them.

371
00:25:46,186 --> 00:25:47,070
Speaker 1: it changes.

372
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,436
Speaker 1: We haven't played the game much lately.

373
00:25:48,858 --> 00:25:49,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz we don't own it.

374
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:51,370
Speaker 1: Our friend who lives far away owns it.

375
00:25:51,752 --> 00:25:53,844
Speaker 0: That's good because it that way we won't get played out.

376
00:25:54,286 --> 00:25:56,339
Speaker 1: Yeah We also played a lot.

377
00:25:56,379 --> 00:25:57,546
Speaker 1: We played some Dungeons & Dragons.

378
00:25:58,652 --> 00:25:59,996
Speaker 1: Oh my god, we actually.

379
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:04,669
Speaker 1: we were sitting around and we realized all of us really want to play D&D and hadn't played in a long time.

380
00:26:05,551 --> 00:26:09,590
Speaker 1: So, uh, we forced our old Dungeon Master to think up a game.

381
00:26:09,992 --> 00:26:12,930
Speaker 1: So he forced us to roll up characters while he thought up a game and then we played a game.

382
00:26:13,532 --> 00:26:14,496
Speaker 0: It was most excellent.

383
00:26:14,797 --> 00:26:17,809
Speaker 1: We stayed up like four in the morning playing and then we finished it the next day.

384
00:26:18,251 --> 00:26:20,983
Speaker 0: It probably wasn't the best, you know campaign I was ever in ever.

385
00:26:21,003 --> 00:26:21,907
Speaker 1: It wasn't a campaign.

386
00:26:21,947 --> 00:26:22,490
Speaker 1: It was a one-off.

387
00:26:22,771 --> 00:26:26,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, still whatever but it wasn't the best D&D I played in my whole life.

388
00:26:27,331 --> 00:26:32,820
Speaker 0: But because it was such a drought it's like, you know Dirty water at the end of a desert.

389
00:26:33,142 --> 00:26:34,750
Speaker 0: Yeah good is cold water.

390
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:43,223
Speaker 1: And plus I got to admit our Dungeon Master Alex came up with one hell of an adventure for you know Zero preparation and a bunch of people demanding you run a game.

391
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:44,649
Speaker 0: Yep, very good.

392
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:52,410
Speaker 1: My only regret is that I made a character and I had all this stuff set for him and I basically ended up just playing Mal from Firefly.

393
00:26:53,751 --> 00:26:54,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, Firefly.

394
00:26:54,576 --> 00:26:56,144
Speaker 0: I don't like Firefly is awesome.

395
00:26:56,205 --> 00:27:05,701
Speaker 0: Whatever you suck I was a paladin and I realized it's hard to roleplay someone who's all Paladin II when you're really in real life.

396
00:27:05,902 --> 00:27:07,227
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, yeah.

397
00:27:07,488 --> 00:27:18,120
Speaker 1: Hmm Let's see We're going to a village to do some sort of semi-secret business and the paladin walks in and says yo unto you villagers I am a paladin and I am here to grab a brab.

398
00:27:18,201 --> 00:27:22,543
Speaker 1: a brab a paladin's do know Some balladins aren't stupid.

399
00:27:22,563 --> 00:27:24,798
Speaker 0: Oh I only had an intelligence of 10.

400
00:27:24,798 --> 00:27:28,455
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'll do it 10 10 is actually average.

401
00:27:28,515 --> 00:27:30,360
Speaker 0: So yeah average.

402
00:27:30,380 --> 00:27:32,204
Speaker 0: I was as smart as what the villagers were.

403
00:27:32,646 --> 00:27:33,989
Speaker 0: My wisdom was 15 though.

404
00:27:34,029 --> 00:27:35,693
Speaker 0: So Uh-huh.

405
00:27:35,853 --> 00:27:36,295
Speaker 0: I think it was.

406
00:27:36,535 --> 00:27:41,573
Speaker 0: part of that was because I didn't quite know how to be a paladin and I kind of know a Little better now.

407
00:27:42,096 --> 00:27:45,532
Speaker 0: Yeah, and part of it was because it was way late at night and the next one Oh, yeah.

408
00:27:45,612 --> 00:27:48,423
Speaker 1: Yeah, we stopped playing at 4 in the morning only because you were asleep.

409
00:27:48,564 --> 00:27:53,224
Speaker 0: Yeah when we played the next day I got a much better job paladin.

410
00:27:53,305 --> 00:27:54,470
Speaker 1: You were much better the next day.

411
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:59,503
Speaker 1: Your character was actually somewhat intelligent and did useful things and actually had things to say.

412
00:27:59,563 --> 00:28:09,269
Speaker 0: that weren't I think the next time a paladin I'm not gonna try to be all evangelical gadi as much as like heroic saving.

413
00:28:11,131 --> 00:28:16,590
Speaker 0: I'll try to be more heroic saving, you know, well not saving throws saving others.

414
00:28:17,107 --> 00:28:21,803
Speaker 0: Ah with my powers Yay, paladins.

415
00:28:23,231 --> 00:28:26,019
Speaker 1: We also played some carcass own carcass owns.

416
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:29,649
Speaker 0: Okay, but it's a quick understand why there's a bunch of expansions for it.

417
00:28:30,112 --> 00:28:36,369
Speaker 1: yeah, we've kind of played it out and You don't seem to learn that you can't beat me in the farmer game.

418
00:28:37,175 --> 00:28:43,807
Speaker 1: You know every time we've ever played You see me build a farmer and you get into your head that you can somehow get more farmers than me.

419
00:28:44,129 --> 00:28:50,032
Speaker 0: and you know Farmer down first in the best spot and it ended up being the whole board and My.

420
00:28:50,112 --> 00:28:57,029
Speaker 0: you know this time you didn't completely dominate the farmer game as in previous times Except I got more points from farmers than anyone else.

421
00:28:57,631 --> 00:29:02,963
Speaker 0: Well, you see what the problem here was that farmers really get you four points per city thing, right?

422
00:29:03,685 --> 00:29:07,997
Speaker 0: It's that I Didn't have enough guys on the board.

423
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:10,245
Speaker 0: I did good enough in the farmer game to win.

424
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:11,710
Speaker 0: I just didn't get anything else.

425
00:29:11,771 --> 00:29:12,900
Speaker 0: I didn't get any roads.

426
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:26,573
Speaker 0: I didn't get enough cities You know and part of it is what tiles you draw and especially in that many players in a game with so with with no expansions It you don't get so many tiles in the game to put guys on So you

427
00:29:26,593 --> 00:29:27,035
Speaker 1: have to put

428
00:29:27,075 --> 00:29:28,220
Speaker 0: a guy in every time.

429
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:32,962
Speaker 1: I realized right away that I had to jump on any point thing I drew because I wouldn't draw as many tiles.

430
00:29:33,042 --> 00:29:34,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't realize that till later.

431
00:29:34,570 --> 00:29:42,847
Speaker 0: but now I know that if I'm playing with not any expansions and So many people I have to start putting my guy and every tile I put down.

432
00:29:42,887 --> 00:29:44,413
Speaker 0: pretty much You know.

433
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:49,210
Speaker 0: whereas in two players you have to be very discerning about where you put your guy because you might not get him back.

434
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:53,229
Speaker 0: Yeah It's a completely different game with different numbers of people.

435
00:29:54,273 --> 00:29:56,230
Speaker 1: We also played some of Wario aware.

436
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:58,333
Speaker 0: Wario aware.

437
00:29:58,353 --> 00:30:00,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not so exciting to talk about.

438
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:00,981
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

439
00:30:01,021 --> 00:30:01,683
Speaker 1: I love that game.

440
00:30:01,964 --> 00:30:07,377
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's alright, you know, but Yeah, it's it's getting kind of played out for me.

441
00:30:07,397 --> 00:30:10,790
Speaker 0: yeah mostly because I haven't seen any new minigames in it.

442
00:30:12,393 --> 00:30:14,890
Speaker 0: You know and a lot of them are the same just with a different picture.

443
00:30:15,031 --> 00:30:16,619
Speaker 1: Yeah that we played some of that.

444
00:30:16,719 --> 00:30:25,394
Speaker 1: the the pac-man game for the GameCube Pac-man game is very good where one guy has the game boy and they're playing pac-man and the other three people are ghosts and they Can't see where pac-man is.

445
00:30:25,414 --> 00:30:28,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, the pac-man game is very good, but I can only play it a few times a night.

446
00:30:29,772 --> 00:30:32,289
Speaker 0: But then and you know at another night I can play it again.

447
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:35,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like once you played a few times in a row you're done.

448
00:30:35,632 --> 00:30:38,430
Speaker 0: But then if you bring it back out again later, it's I could play it all night.

449
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:39,816
Speaker 1: But part of that's cuz I win a lot.

450
00:30:39,836 --> 00:30:45,335
Speaker 1: I mean once I get pac-man I just clear the board over and over Depends who the ghosts are.

451
00:30:45,395 --> 00:30:47,784
Speaker 0: if the ghosts are really good they can get you.

452
00:30:47,865 --> 00:30:51,357
Speaker 1: but if the ghosts aren't so good And the thing is the if the ghosts are not so good.

453
00:30:51,437 --> 00:30:54,066
Speaker 1: I clear the board, but if the ghosts are actually really good.

454
00:30:54,086 --> 00:31:01,689
Speaker 1: I Usually get more points because while I don't clear the board because they eventually get me I eat them because they're aggressively going after me and then I get more points.

455
00:31:03,012 --> 00:31:09,064
Speaker 0: You know, I remember when we played it previously The you know pac-man would switch around a whole lot.

456
00:31:09,105 --> 00:31:11,868
Speaker 0: when we played it this weekend It didn't seem to switch around so much.

457
00:31:12,451 --> 00:31:16,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people were clearing the board and I think it was a difference in the ghost strategy.

458
00:31:16,425 --> 00:31:21,026
Speaker 0: and you know people were Trying to camp power pills and they were trying to eat the fruit a lot.

459
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:21,750
Speaker 1: Well, that was me.

460
00:31:21,951 --> 00:31:24,385
Speaker 1: I was the only one eating the fruit and that's how I win every game.

461
00:31:24,626 --> 00:31:25,310
Speaker 1: That's my secret.

462
00:31:25,651 --> 00:31:32,074
Speaker 1: I get enough points with pac-man to stay ahead and then I let people who aren't going to win be pac-man while I just Eat the fruit over and over.

463
00:31:32,295 --> 00:31:36,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, I eat the fruit over and over also, but you know, sometimes it's a race to the fruit.

464
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:36,812
Speaker 0: What can you do?

465
00:31:36,832 --> 00:31:39,825
Speaker 1: Well, I always win it because I'm always closer to the pan.

466
00:31:39,865 --> 00:31:41,070
Speaker 0: I got the fruit plenty of times.

467
00:31:42,676 --> 00:31:43,728
Speaker 0: But you know the game.

468
00:31:45,391 --> 00:31:45,812
Speaker 0: It's good.

469
00:31:46,013 --> 00:31:46,756
Speaker 0: It's interesting.

470
00:31:47,017 --> 00:31:50,250
Speaker 0: The price is right on it, you know, or at least was when it was out.

471
00:31:50,614 --> 00:31:51,409
Speaker 0: It was pretty much free.

472
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:57,130
Speaker 1: The sad thing is that it's the only good thing in that game because when you buy it it comes with this other pac-man game.

473
00:31:57,371 --> 00:31:59,317
Speaker 0: well, you when it originally came out.

474
00:31:59,858 --> 00:32:03,349
Speaker 0: you would get it if you bought like any game on this list, you know be free.

475
00:32:03,369 --> 00:32:15,526
Speaker 0: and Then when that promotion was over and they ran out of the free discs on their own They the only way to get it is to buy pac-man adventure land something.

476
00:32:15,586 --> 00:32:16,530
Speaker 1: It's the worst game ever.

477
00:32:16,771 --> 00:32:20,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the worst game ever, but it comes with the pac-man verse in the same package.

478
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,906
Speaker 1: We pulled it out and turn it on to see if it could actually be as bad as we'd heard.

479
00:32:23,926 --> 00:32:24,910
Speaker 1: and it was worse.

480
00:32:25,232 --> 00:32:35,786
Speaker 0: I played it for maybe 10 seconds and you know I was pac-man and it was 3d and I was walking around eating pills and pellets and it was like a ghost And it was like an adventure land kind of.

481
00:32:35,866 --> 00:32:36,933
Speaker 0: oh my god It was terrible.

482
00:32:36,993 --> 00:32:39,446
Speaker 0: after like I played it for five seconds and I want to kill myself.

483
00:32:39,486 --> 00:32:40,150
Speaker 0: So I stopped playing.

484
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:43,745
Speaker 0: Why do people make games like that thinking they're gonna be fun?

485
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:44,348
Speaker 0: I don't know.

486
00:32:44,993 --> 00:32:46,201
Speaker 1: I don't know what they I wouldn't handle.

487
00:32:46,241 --> 00:32:53,768
Speaker 0: let them release that game Nintendo or let you release things as long as you know, they're not full of bugs and they work.

488
00:32:53,829 --> 00:32:54,109
Speaker 0: they don't.

489
00:32:55,612 --> 00:32:56,900
Speaker 1: It's got one glaring bug.

490
00:32:57,001 --> 00:32:57,786
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

491
00:32:57,807 --> 00:33:02,263
Speaker 0: Yeah but you know Nintendo doesn't judge the content of games.

492
00:33:02,303 --> 00:33:07,030
Speaker 0: and they released them which You know, they didn't do for the NES either.

493
00:33:07,572 --> 00:33:10,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, in fact, no one really seems to do it these days.

494
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:15,570
Speaker 0: if I had a console I would make sure the only games out for it were crazy awesome.

495
00:33:16,451 --> 00:33:18,559
Speaker 1: But yeah, but then I can games appear in.

496
00:33:19,322 --> 00:33:26,010
Speaker 0: yeah, that'd be a problem, you know Especially when people start saying all your system doesn't have a lot of games for it.

497
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:26,713
Speaker 0: What does it have?

498
00:33:26,773 --> 00:33:28,661
Speaker 0: these three games and you know?

499
00:33:28,782 --> 00:33:29,665
Speaker 0: sure I could point out.

500
00:33:29,886 --> 00:33:30,730
Speaker 0: Well, look at your system.

501
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:31,435
Speaker 0: What does it have?

502
00:33:31,717 --> 00:33:33,430
Speaker 0: these three games in a pile of crap?

503
00:33:34,370 --> 00:33:35,955
Speaker 0: But there are people who buy the crap.

504
00:33:35,975 --> 00:33:36,918
Speaker 0: That's why it exists.

505
00:33:36,978 --> 00:33:43,218
Speaker 1: And yeah, mostly parents who know their kid like to movies So they buy the game that went along with the movie.

506
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,503
Speaker 0: you'd be surprised.

507
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:46,090
Speaker 0: who buys those games with movies?

508
00:33:46,633 --> 00:33:48,824
Speaker 0: Actual people who buy them like they want to play them.

509
00:33:49,467 --> 00:33:51,655
Speaker 0: Wow It's scary.

510
00:33:51,695 --> 00:34:08,949
Speaker 0: the people who buy these non-awesome games Like it's really frightening Like remember we saw that kid in Game stop or wherever and he ran over to the DS rack Like he was excited and he was gonna get a game that he knew he well, yeah, and he got Rayman.

511
00:34:09,876 --> 00:34:16,790
Speaker 0: I mean, come on kid get freakin Mario Kart get advance Wars get any of the other ten awesome games.

512
00:34:17,853 --> 00:34:18,900
Speaker 0: Are you getting Rayman?

513
00:34:18,981 --> 00:34:22,815
Speaker 0: It's a boring generic Nothing new, you know.

514
00:34:22,917 --> 00:34:26,525
Speaker 0: platform game that has been has seen like ten remakes.

515
00:34:26,867 --> 00:34:27,569
Speaker 0: None of which were good.

516
00:34:28,291 --> 00:34:30,799
Speaker 1: Haha way to piss on that kid's parade.

517
00:34:30,819 --> 00:34:34,250
Speaker 0: His parade is thoroughly drenched in yellow urea.

518
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:38,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're crotched old men when it comes to video games and you know what?

519
00:34:39,070 --> 00:34:42,063
Speaker 0: Crotched yield men are right not like this Muppet Show old man.

520
00:34:42,485 --> 00:34:42,989
Speaker 0: They know what's up.

521
00:34:44,813 --> 00:34:46,047
Speaker 1: So I think that's every game we played.

522
00:34:47,753 --> 00:34:49,108
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't play San Juan.

523
00:34:50,132 --> 00:34:52,509
Speaker 1: We played a couple of other video games that you guys don't care about.

524
00:34:53,391 --> 00:34:55,719
Speaker 0: I don't know if we played another board game or not, but it doesn't matter.

525
00:34:55,981 --> 00:34:57,748
Speaker 1: Nah, we didn't all right cool.

526
00:34:58,991 --> 00:35:01,340
Speaker 0: So yeah, I guess the first part of the podcast messed up.

527
00:35:01,701 --> 00:35:03,869
Speaker 1: Yeah, and yeah, yeah.

528
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:07,389
Speaker 0: But I think this one should be good enough on its own.

529
00:35:07,711 --> 00:35:11,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, we went a little long on the video game part to cover the fact that the rest of it was done.

530
00:35:11,853 --> 00:35:19,269
Speaker 1: It was okay because while we had good stuff to talk about It was mostly us dredging the bottom of the news pile because there was not much news.

531
00:35:19,309 --> 00:35:20,532
Speaker 1: that Really?

532
00:35:20,672 --> 00:35:21,716
Speaker 1: We wanted to talk about.

533
00:35:22,057 --> 00:35:24,285
Speaker 0: yeah, and the things of the day are in there.

534
00:35:24,305 --> 00:35:27,521
Speaker 0: then those are messed up But we'll still put the links in the things.

535
00:35:27,581 --> 00:35:28,446
Speaker 0: you can see what they were.

536
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:34,369
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, to sum up my thing of the day is a device that gives you an artificial Nintendo finger.

537
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:41,070
Speaker 0: My thing of the day was a French book from 1844 that said if you masturbate you will die horribly.

538
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:43,364
Speaker 0: It had illustrations that were hilarious.

539
00:35:43,586 --> 00:35:47,259
Speaker 0: Haha All right, I think that's.
