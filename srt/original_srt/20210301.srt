1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:12,231
Speaker 1: It's Monday, March 1st, 2021.

2
00:00:12,231 --> 00:00:12,712
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,334 --> 00:00:15,639
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:15,659 --> 00:00:19,640
Speaker 1: tonight We are talking about cryptocurrencies and why they are terrible.

5
00:00:20,962 --> 00:00:21,954
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:23,803 --> 00:00:26,619
Speaker 1: So you might recall on a previous geek nights at some point.

7
00:00:27,505 --> 00:00:36,086
Speaker 1: Time just doesn't exist anymore for me But I talked about how I had to replace the fans in my computer because the computers like yeah from 2016 And a new fans.

8
00:00:36,106 --> 00:00:37,190
Speaker 0: new fans came in the mail.

9
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:39,720
Speaker 0: the new fans came and you put him in and they're great.

10
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:40,865
Speaker 1: I put him in and they're great.

11
00:00:40,905 --> 00:00:41,347
Speaker 1: God damn it.

12
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:42,331
Speaker 1: That's the whole opening bit.

13
00:00:42,733 --> 00:00:49,340
Speaker 1: But what I can say is that one of the fans Was smaller than the fan that could have gone there.

14
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:49,681
Speaker 1: They came.

15
00:00:49,722 --> 00:00:55,484
Speaker 1: actually Kate case actually came with 120 millimeter fan in the by 120.

16
00:00:55,484 --> 00:01:01,967
Speaker 1: No, so the fact the case can fit a 140 back there But the case stop the one that came.

17
00:01:02,047 --> 00:01:05,738
Speaker 1: stock in this NZXT case was a 120 but the stock intake either.

18
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:08,994
Speaker 1: so I put 140s everywhere because why not?

19
00:01:09,457 --> 00:01:20,719
Speaker 1: and The fact that the top fan had not been pulling its fair share of air previously was significantly impacting the performance of the GPU.

20
00:01:22,086 --> 00:01:22,918
Speaker 0: Why did they not?

21
00:01:24,182 --> 00:01:26,899
Speaker 0: You know if NZXT knows this why didn't they?

22
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:27,986
Speaker 1: well This is a case from 2016.

23
00:01:27,986 --> 00:01:29,738
Speaker 1: They don't even make this case anymore.

24
00:01:31,062 --> 00:01:33,293
Speaker 1: Their cases are way better now in terms of air flow.

25
00:01:33,896 --> 00:01:40,660
Speaker 1: Well, except for that one Recall the one that's a literal danger to your house the one that I was thinking about buying from a HD PC.

26
00:01:41,724 --> 00:01:42,478
Speaker 0: Well, not anymore.

27
00:01:44,441 --> 00:01:45,446
Speaker 0: But you could buy the recouped.

28
00:01:45,466 --> 00:01:46,912
Speaker 0: you buy the recalled one, it'll be just fine.

29
00:01:46,932 --> 00:01:48,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically yeah.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:52,875
Speaker 0: So I get if people don't know NZXT who is a great maker of computer cases.

31
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:53,537
Speaker 0: They're really.

32
00:01:53,617 --> 00:01:54,300
Speaker 0: they're really pretty good.

33
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,636
Speaker 0: I would buy them if I was gonna but even despite the recall, I would still buy one.

34
00:01:57,656 --> 00:02:00,046
Speaker 0: Yeah That's the recall only affected.

35
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:01,973
Speaker 1: I guess we could have done this as news, but we didn't.

36
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:03,479
Speaker 1: the recall only affected.

37
00:02:04,781 --> 00:02:10,803
Speaker 1: If you want one of those stupid risers to mount your video card vertically into the side Which I don't.

38
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:11,947
Speaker 0: I do that in my.

39
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,473
Speaker 0: I do that in my HD PC.

40
00:02:13,493 --> 00:02:16,123
Speaker 0: that lies flat, but otherwise Yeah, don't do that.

41
00:02:16,143 --> 00:02:20,720
Speaker 1: You know, like if you're doing a mid tower, that's pretty much just gonna be a worse cooling solution for you.

42
00:02:21,004 --> 00:02:25,978
Speaker 1: It also introduces Risk of problems independent of start a fire.

43
00:02:26,942 --> 00:02:31,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, only one NZXT case has a fire hazard and got a recall but everything else is fine.

44
00:02:31,858 --> 00:02:39,777
Speaker 1: Yep But it was interesting that you know the K the faith the can at the fake case fan in the back had been busted for some time like once.

45
00:02:39,857 --> 00:02:44,799
Speaker 1: once I realized it wasn't really spending much and What was happening is when I played games?

46
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,531
Speaker 1: The inside of the case would get hotter and hotter because the airflow wasn't great.

47
00:02:48,612 --> 00:02:53,171
Speaker 1: the puller fans on the front were effectively also Pushing out that hole in the top.

48
00:02:53,452 --> 00:02:54,879
Speaker 1: I only had one puller fan.

49
00:02:55,401 --> 00:03:03,760
Speaker 1: We're up equalizing now that everything's fully equalized with all these fans and everything like reconfigured The inside of the case stays pretty cool.

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,670
Speaker 1: The GPU stays around 50 when I'm playing overwatch and max settings.

51
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:13,683
Speaker 1: before when with the old fan it was held to hover it around 56 hmm Whatever.

52
00:03:13,965 --> 00:03:14,327
Speaker 0: That's that.

53
00:03:14,347 --> 00:03:16,219
Speaker 1: Yeah the most I could milk out of that.

54
00:03:16,923 --> 00:03:20,900
Speaker 0: The only thing I can say is that we did an episode on computer maintenance way back.

55
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:26,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least a while at least a while back and I've been doing more Using my Google tasks.

56
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:32,437
Speaker 0: I guess you whatever task managing thing you might to-do list kind of thing you use in your life.

57
00:03:32,517 --> 00:03:43,960
Speaker 0: I use Google keep sure As you Google tasks, and I've been putting more recurring tasks And one of the ones that I have is clean out filters on CPU fans to remove all the dust.

58
00:03:45,381 --> 00:03:50,619
Speaker 0: So I've been doing that like every few months and you know a month or two and that's good I guess.

59
00:03:51,722 --> 00:03:54,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, all my fans are working cuz I don't hear any noises down there.

60
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:59,896
Speaker 1: So yep fans have gotten better too because the old fans I had plugged into the 3-pin like they were standard.

61
00:04:00,358 --> 00:04:02,145
Speaker 1: the new fans I got are all 4-pin.

62
00:04:02,427 --> 00:04:04,095
Speaker 1: So my software can control them better.

63
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:06,718
Speaker 0: I Mean, yeah, I don't think all mine are that way.

64
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:10,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's just this computer that feels like it's brand new.

65
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:13,519
Speaker 1: I built it in like 2016 and that was a long time ago.

66
00:04:14,643 --> 00:04:15,331
Speaker 0: It's not that long.

67
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:21,235
Speaker 1: All right Yeah, so in the news, there's ton of tech news, but it's not quite time for the tech news.

68
00:04:21,255 --> 00:04:21,797
Speaker 0: It's almost time.

69
00:04:21,837 --> 00:04:22,620
Speaker 0: RIM's getting excited.

70
00:04:22,721 --> 00:04:23,204
Speaker 0: It's almost time.

71
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:23,727
Speaker 1: I'm getting excited.

72
00:04:23,788 --> 00:04:24,533
Speaker 1: It's my favorite.

73
00:04:24,553 --> 00:04:25,580
Speaker 0: You don't want to use all your news.

74
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,284
Speaker 0: You won't have any.

75
00:04:26,304 --> 00:04:27,028
Speaker 0: when your time comes.

76
00:04:27,049 --> 00:04:28,638
Speaker 0: you'll blow for a whole year, right?

77
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:29,683
Speaker 0: You'll do like.

78
00:04:29,904 --> 00:04:32,400
Speaker 0: you'll have just a really crappy news for a tech news roundup.

79
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,998
Speaker 0: It'll be a shitty one and then you won't be able to do another one for a whole year.

80
00:04:35,864 --> 00:04:40,380
Speaker 1: Maybe Some days you should lay it the future of geek nights.

81
00:04:40,762 --> 00:04:43,112
Speaker 1: The Monday show is gonna turn into just tech news roundup.

82
00:04:43,634 --> 00:04:44,860
Speaker 0: That's that's all you want it to be.

83
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:51,685
Speaker 0: But I think you should just hold off on this tech news roundup for 2021 until you build up enough good news But it's always there.

84
00:04:51,725 --> 00:04:53,030
Speaker 1: I got so much tech news.

85
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,118
Speaker 1: every time we do a tech show that I'm like holding back.

86
00:04:55,258 --> 00:04:58,933
Speaker 1: always Make sure you're just saying round up like Christmas for me.

87
00:04:59,595 --> 00:05:00,479
Speaker 0: Don't don't waste one.

88
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:10,852
Speaker 1: Well, especially because usually traditionally the tech news roundup happens just as convention season is ending and We're going into our like lull before convention season starts up again.

89
00:05:11,294 --> 00:05:12,620
Speaker 1: Of course that didn't happen this year.

90
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:27,939
Speaker 1: So in the news, if you're not familiar, there are many social media platforms out there and one of them Quite literally the worst of them is called close to the worst of them I mean if there's meant there are several is still the parlor one, right?

91
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:31,714
Speaker 1: Parlor is not as bad as gab sadly really Like.

92
00:05:34,926 --> 00:05:35,719
Speaker 1: They're all bad.

93
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:37,748
Speaker 1: But the Nazi I didn't.

94
00:05:37,808 --> 00:05:38,149
Speaker 0: I wouldn't.

95
00:05:38,209 --> 00:05:39,053
Speaker 0: I didn't think that either.

96
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,900
Speaker 0: any of them were better than any of the others.

97
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,479
Speaker 0: They thought they were just all equally Nazi.

98
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:54,560
Speaker 1: so if I had to describe the differences parler is people who got kicked off Twitter and Gab is people who are openly pedophiles and open like like right parlor, isn't that?

99
00:05:55,422 --> 00:05:59,670
Speaker 1: Like if Hitler were still alive his account would be on gab because even parlor would have kicked him off.

100
00:06:00,581 --> 00:06:04,975
Speaker 1: You sure really grab is so much worse than parlor.

101
00:06:05,096 --> 00:06:06,360
Speaker 1: You have no idea?

102
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:07,443
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't looked.

103
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,008
Speaker 0: I haven't looked at either one.

104
00:06:09,108 --> 00:06:13,160
Speaker 1: So I'm trusting the reporting of people who follow like fascist groups.

105
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:18,382
Speaker 0: Yeah, all I know is that the name that those are the names of fascist social websites I'll make.

106
00:06:18,422 --> 00:06:20,756
Speaker 0: gab is reddit style and parlor is Twitter style.

107
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:21,340
Speaker 0: That's all I know.

108
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,384
Speaker 0: I don't know anything else.

109
00:06:22,745 --> 00:06:28,320
Speaker 1: the thing that far-right extremist social networks have in common Is that they rarely?

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,385
Speaker 1: Have good IT or technology.

111
00:06:30,706 --> 00:06:37,360
Speaker 1: because most people who are good enough at technology to do a platform like that Right aren't actually fascists.

112
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:46,979
Speaker 1: They might work for a company that does things that enable the sort of neoliberal dystopian hellscape that we live in But they're not like down with the Reich.

113
00:06:47,762 --> 00:06:57,435
Speaker 0: So those those places even you know, even if someone had no morals and high skills of IT Those places that are on the far right don't have a lot of money.

114
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:58,500
Speaker 1: That is also true.

115
00:06:59,002 --> 00:06:59,464
Speaker 0: You're gonna.

116
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:06,592
Speaker 0: if you have no morals, you're just a mercenary or in capitalist society You're gonna work for the goog right this the Facebook's or whatever.

117
00:07:06,813 --> 00:07:08,137
Speaker 0: You're not gonna work for the gabs.

118
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:12,526
Speaker 1: They can't pay you Yep, so gab Parlor, I think I hacked a while ago.

119
00:07:12,647 --> 00:07:25,329
Speaker 1: gab like just recently got mega hacked and it appears That someone downloaded their entire database every post every private message Completely in the clear ready for anyone to read.

120
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,014
Speaker 1: they got for all their groups.

121
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:29,080
Speaker 1: They got raw unencrypted passwords.

122
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:33,373
Speaker 1: They got the hash passwords for the actual accounts themselves.

123
00:07:33,955 --> 00:07:41,679
Speaker 1: The only thing we don't know there is Rumblings that those hash passwords don't even appear to be salted, but no one's sure.

124
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:43,488
Speaker 1: yet Like I'm still waiting for confirmation.

125
00:07:43,508 --> 00:07:44,633
Speaker 0: hit him with the rainbow table.

126
00:07:44,653 --> 00:07:48,065
Speaker 0: See what comes out exactly Our rainbow tables.

127
00:07:48,567 --> 00:08:00,320
Speaker 1: So yeah, if you are a piece of shit and you have an account on gab Everyone can read every awful thing you posted pretty sure is mostly child porn and planning the riot and the attack on the Capitol.

128
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:03,149
Speaker 0: Okay, now this child porn hugging.

129
00:08:03,169 --> 00:08:04,414
Speaker 0: the FBI hasn't done anything about that.

130
00:08:04,434 --> 00:08:05,640
Speaker 0: They loved going after child porn.

131
00:08:05,941 --> 00:08:08,779
Speaker 1: I imagine they will be doing something about this leak.

132
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:14,776
Speaker 1: Okay, I think a lot of people are in a lot of trouble around child porn because of this.

133
00:08:15,579 --> 00:08:15,760
Speaker 0: good.

134
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:24,485
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean no good person has an account on gab this whoever did this hack which apparently was done via a Hold on.

135
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:24,868
Speaker 0: Hold on.

136
00:08:24,908 --> 00:08:26,620
Speaker 0: Hold on the person who committed this hack.

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,719
Speaker 0: It doesn't hear him had to make a gab account in order to figure stuff out.

138
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,351
Speaker 1: So yes, someone may have a research gab account.

139
00:08:34,631 --> 00:08:37,220
Speaker 1: if you have an earnest gab account, you're definitely a bad person.

140
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:54,827
Speaker 1: that's a good clarification, but the vulnerability that was used by the person who hacked it who is known as Jax Perot and my little anonymous revival project got all the data via a Simplistic SQL injection attack.

141
00:08:55,569 --> 00:08:56,191
Speaker 0: that makes sense.

142
00:08:56,332 --> 00:08:58,900
Speaker 0: But if you database dump, you're probably gonna get it via injection.

143
00:08:59,261 --> 00:09:03,694
Speaker 1: Yep, and shitty social networks like this tend to have just one giant database that runs everything.

144
00:09:04,556 --> 00:09:05,760
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, you're not that big.

145
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:12,320
Speaker 0: You need to have some you know, like multi-stage multi-region kind of partition database setup, you know.

146
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:18,300
Speaker 1: So keep the hacktivism up like go after these right-wing platforms because they are usually really soft targets.

147
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:25,234
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah in some other news Fries which I'll be I've never been to a fries never seen.

148
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:34,555
Speaker 0: if I may I. if I've been to one I don't remember it but I assume that they're just the same thing as a Best Buy or what a circus city used to be Or pretty much like I.

149
00:09:34,575 --> 00:09:44,962
Speaker 1: I'll be honest I never understood it front people being obsessed with fries Really reeked of people just like caring a lot about their local non Wegmans grocery store Right.

150
00:09:45,002 --> 00:09:54,480
Speaker 0: It's like there are certain stores that really are you know us in the same category as other stores But do something special and different to like level them up, right?

151
00:09:54,580 --> 00:10:00,851
Speaker 0: So for example, you have furniture store, but then IKEA is like it's got something going on That's significantly different.

152
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:01,153
Speaker 0: right.

153
00:10:01,415 --> 00:10:06,720
Speaker 0: where you have that You know, it's the layout of the place and the way you shop there and the thing at the end, right?

154
00:10:08,043 --> 00:10:10,532
Speaker 0: And then you got your supermarkets, but then you got your Wegmans.

155
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,560
Speaker 0: Wegmans is still just a supermarket.

156
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:15,659
Speaker 0: It's just so big and has so much good stuff, right?

157
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:19,432
Speaker 0: You know, but then you got your TJ which is also different.

158
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,600
Speaker 0: It's smaller, but they've got special stuff.

159
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,945
Speaker 0: It's all a stuff right.

160
00:10:23,165 --> 00:10:26,397
Speaker 0: and then you get your Stu Leonard's which is in that IKEA zone of like.

161
00:10:26,678 --> 00:10:30,845
Speaker 0: is this even a Park right?

162
00:10:30,905 --> 00:10:31,668
Speaker 0: What the hell is this?

163
00:10:31,688 --> 00:10:33,195
Speaker 0: There's an actual cow here.

164
00:10:33,255 --> 00:10:34,239
Speaker 0: Where did this milk come from?

165
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,094
Speaker 1: You're you've talked for as long as you knew shit like I'll Stu Leonard's not the Stu Leonard's.

166
00:10:39,396 --> 00:10:51,780
Speaker 0: then we finally went I was like all right, this place is Weirder than I expected like it's something It's only people who live in the Northeast US could possibly know about Stu Leonard's and let me tell you it's really something good.

167
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,004
Speaker 0: But yeah, I never.

168
00:10:53,025 --> 00:10:53,506
Speaker 0: I never.

169
00:10:53,968 --> 00:10:57,983
Speaker 0: if I'd have been to Fry's it's only been once I don't remember it But I I have.

170
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:09,540
Speaker 0: I can't imagine you can do something with that sort of store to really make it that special Wegmans or IKEA level different experience than what you get out of a Best Buy.

171
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,092
Speaker 0: So I never believed anyone who was like so high on fries.

172
00:11:13,132 --> 00:11:17,531
Speaker 0: They remind me of the people who are really high on What are those burgers from out west?

173
00:11:17,591 --> 00:11:19,260
Speaker 1: Oh in and out or yeah?

174
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,824
Speaker 0: It's like I can't imagine.

175
00:11:20,925 --> 00:11:26,340
Speaker 0: in and out is like significant actually any big freaking deal compared to like crappy old five guys.

176
00:11:27,244 --> 00:11:30,239
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, what could possibly be special about that?

177
00:11:30,581 --> 00:11:34,960
Speaker 1: So it was telling that when this hat when this news broke my first thought was fries was still in business.

178
00:11:36,181 --> 00:11:36,984
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't think.

179
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:48,171
Speaker 1: I basically thought that every store except Best Buy had gone down And I'm still kind of amazed that Best Buy still exists, but I think I can come up with some reasons Why I think they exist because they're the last one.

180
00:11:48,612 --> 00:11:50,380
Speaker 1: coupled with they have an online presence.

181
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:51,082
Speaker 1: That's pretty good.

182
00:11:51,122 --> 00:11:52,467
Speaker 1: Like they just sell stuff online.

183
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:54,213
Speaker 0: the same way to get that.

184
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:55,719
Speaker 0: GameStop is the last one.

185
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:59,371
Speaker 0: I have the last one though GameStop is dying still.

186
00:11:59,411 --> 00:12:08,357
Speaker 0: but but Best Buy also, I think a lot of their stuff Comes from the things that they sell that you can't just buy online.

187
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:11,810
Speaker 0: and also They some they get stuff right?

188
00:12:11,931 --> 00:12:14,200
Speaker 0: Yeah supply runs out at other places.

189
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:17,212
Speaker 1: I guess electronics are such an interesting like they're.

190
00:12:17,574 --> 00:12:33,318
Speaker 1: they're not completely unique But they're in a unique class of digital good or not digital goods goods Non-digital goods physical meatspace goods that people need to buy because most people will only ever buy televisions or maybe whole computers.

191
00:12:33,338 --> 00:12:41,580
Speaker 1: and There's a very relatively small subset of the population who buys components of computers or more advanced electronics.

192
00:12:42,582 --> 00:12:44,230
Speaker 1: Mmm, I guess I'll leave appliances out.

193
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,316
Speaker 1: That's a whole different thing.

194
00:12:45,357 --> 00:12:46,000
Speaker 1: Like that's my cells.

195
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, where would you buy appliances if not Best Buy?

196
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:51,939
Speaker 1: I mean, I would just buy appliances online and have them drop-shift me too.

197
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,465
Speaker 0: But I think I don't think people.

198
00:12:53,565 --> 00:13:08,300
Speaker 0: I think while I think well overall our society has gotten used to buying things online I still don't I'm not sure I don't have you know But my gut tells me that like only people like us are gonna buy a TV or a washing machine online.

199
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:14,320
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people TV is increasingly online would guess that a lot of people would not do that.

200
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,280
Speaker 0: They would want to go to a Best Buy to buy your TV or your washing machine.

201
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:20,153
Speaker 1: I think there's data that TVs at least are going the other route.

202
00:13:20,454 --> 00:13:21,860
Speaker 1: but appliances might be like cars.

203
00:13:21,921 --> 00:13:31,340
Speaker 1: I remember those old studies I wonder if this is still true showing that most people when they want to buy a car They basically buy whatever the dealerships kind of push on them.

204
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:35,414
Speaker 1: They never go out shopping for a specific car like people.

205
00:13:35,434 --> 00:13:37,120
Speaker 1: there's a whole weird ecosystem around that.

206
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:51,247
Speaker 1: But anyway, we thought with computer components in particular We're in this interesting space right now in that like I won't buy computer parts from Amazon because I've gotten too many counterfeits and scams Like in the last several years.

207
00:13:51,609 --> 00:13:55,560
Speaker 0: I have but that was years ago and the scam rate has gone way up since then.

208
00:13:55,640 --> 00:14:02,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I would be I would buy some from there but only After you know, very careful Checking.

209
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:30,396
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the trend in this sector in especially stuff like computer components where there's a big OEM market is That I think people who know and want to buy these types of components are either gonna go to a specialty retailer online like Newegg which like focuses on that sector and is very trustworthy because their brand is on the line and They're also buying name brands of the electronics themselves.

210
00:14:30,456 --> 00:14:45,318
Speaker 1: Like they know what they want They've done the research in advance and they're buying specific things, which means also a generic Electronics retailer a physical one or an online one Doesn't have really a well an avenue to compete with that.

211
00:14:46,781 --> 00:14:51,820
Speaker 1: Why would someone physically go to a fries when they could go to Newegg and get the same experience for a video card?

212
00:14:52,821 --> 00:14:58,440
Speaker 0: Sure, but I think that's also if you think just in the physical shopping world, right?

213
00:14:58,580 --> 00:15:01,140
Speaker 0: Let's say somebody wants to go to a store and buy a thing.

214
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,032
Speaker 0: Well, if you live in New York City, right I can.

215
00:15:03,193 --> 00:15:06,131
Speaker 0: if I want to buy a thing There's a store for that thing.

216
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:07,600
Speaker 1: that is true here, right?

217
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:12,193
Speaker 0: If you live out in the the mega who knows where right?

218
00:15:12,574 --> 00:15:13,858
Speaker 0: It's like Walmart is the store.

219
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:14,280
Speaker 0: That's it.

220
00:15:14,604 --> 00:15:15,539
Speaker 0: You got no other store.

221
00:15:15,965 --> 00:15:22,720
Speaker 0: but if you live in between You might have a Walmart and a Best Buy and then but you're not gonna have like a camera store there.

222
00:15:22,941 --> 00:15:30,864
Speaker 0: It's not like there could be but not likely to have a camera store or you know, like some kind of specialty Place like that.

223
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:37,140
Speaker 0: So if you need something that is in any sort of electronic category, you might not even have a GameStop.

224
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:44,229
Speaker 0: It's like yeah that only place to buy video games in town is Best Buy or I guess Walmart does sell video games, too Right, but yeah, you get the idea.

225
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:46,519
Speaker 0: All right, but I guess it's your store.

226
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:58,657
Speaker 1: But I guess part of what's what's happening there, too Is that you know what I just said about the brands a lot of the kinds of electronics that might previously have been bought even by professionals in places like this.

227
00:15:58,978 --> 00:16:24,601
Speaker 1: those are the kinds of people who are more likely to buy online and The brands that actually sell those trustworthy goods are increasingly going direct to consumer Like NZXT, you can buy NZXT computer components directly from NZXT and I as a personal rule for like five plus years now if a brand I am buying something from because I shop mostly based On brands and the trustworthiness of those brands.

228
00:16:25,204 --> 00:16:26,570
Speaker 1: I will always buy direct if I can.

229
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,930
Speaker 1: I only go to a generic retailer if I cannot buy directly from the source.

230
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:35,250
Speaker 1: And if I have to go to a retailer, I always try to go to a specialty retailer first.

231
00:16:35,734 --> 00:16:44,225
Speaker 1: Amazon is like the last resort or It's the place I go for Undifferentiated commodified goods like I need ten white plates.

232
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:47,493
Speaker 0: I need Sometimes price.

233
00:16:47,753 --> 00:16:49,578
Speaker 0: sometimes price matters a little bit, right?

234
00:16:49,659 --> 00:16:56,630
Speaker 0: So, you know, there are situations more to buy directly from the brand than from Amazon Depends how much more right, you know, it's easy.

235
00:16:56,771 --> 00:16:58,990
Speaker 0: It's easy to say when it's only a little bit more, right?

236
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:04,230
Speaker 0: But sometimes Amazon just has a huge sale and if it you can if you're pretty sure you're gonna get legit good.

237
00:17:05,712 --> 00:17:07,176
Speaker 0: Then you can't you know, it's like.

238
00:17:07,217 --> 00:17:08,201
Speaker 0: well I got no choice.

239
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:08,803
Speaker 0: I'm saving $300, right?

240
00:17:08,823 --> 00:17:12,609
Speaker 0: You can't say no But I think the world is moving toward this.

241
00:17:12,690 --> 00:17:15,328
Speaker 0: No one can blame you for shopping on Amazon when you're saving 300 bucks.

242
00:17:15,690 --> 00:17:22,310
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, but I have increasingly found that buying direct is never more expensive than Amazon except for very old things.

243
00:17:22,551 --> 00:17:23,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's you.

244
00:17:23,237 --> 00:17:24,829
Speaker 0: I mean I bought this new 4k monitor.

245
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,405
Speaker 0: I bought it from LG comm now the LG comm web store e-commerce software.

246
00:17:30,445 --> 00:17:44,192
Speaker 0: wise their website was not the greatest But The monitor is here and I paid the right amount of money for it, you know And the last time I bought a video card the 1050 that's in my HD PC, which I was in 2018.

247
00:17:44,192 --> 00:17:46,338
Speaker 0: I bought that from EVGA comm yeah.

248
00:17:46,599 --> 00:17:49,509
Speaker 0: Yeah that directly it totally showed up.

249
00:17:50,010 --> 00:17:51,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, I paid a normal price for it.

250
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:55,691
Speaker 0: It's still worth just as it's still selling for what I paid for it in 2018.

251
00:17:55,691 --> 00:18:03,704
Speaker 1: But I think the few the future of non commodified goods Specifically and fry like this fries thing is just a symptom of this.

252
00:18:04,065 --> 00:18:18,057
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna see showroom big-box stores where Brands will pay to showcase their goods But most of the actual purchasing will be done online or if it's in those stores that yeah There's tons of this in the city.

253
00:18:18,118 --> 00:18:19,885
Speaker 0: There's like tons of like clothing store.

254
00:18:19,905 --> 00:18:20,890
Speaker 0: That's where we bought our bed.

255
00:18:21,071 --> 00:18:25,370
Speaker 1: We went to a bed matures that had yeah the mattress there was like 10 mattress brands.

256
00:18:25,811 --> 00:18:30,889
Speaker 1: All just put like samples of other mattresses in this dumpy little storefront and we laid out them all.

257
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:38,470
Speaker 0: Only businesses right that are like, you know, the kind that will like buy Instagram ads to sell their product, right?

258
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:39,314
Speaker 0: They in the city.

259
00:18:39,354 --> 00:18:40,662
Speaker 0: They open up little showrooms.

260
00:18:40,742 --> 00:18:42,170
Speaker 0: It's literally just alright.

261
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:44,781
Speaker 0: You really don't want to buy our stuff until you see it.

262
00:18:44,861 --> 00:18:45,102
Speaker 0: Okay.

263
00:18:45,122 --> 00:18:46,950
Speaker 0: Well, here's we rented out the cheapest place.

264
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,768
Speaker 0: You can come see the stuff and then buy it online.

265
00:18:49,613 --> 00:18:53,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess the part that they get back to you know, the gig nights thing like you and I the way we shop.

266
00:18:54,992 --> 00:19:09,574
Speaker 1: We also have to remember that we and people like us and like a lot of people listen to the show Engage with buying things very differently because I think the average geek nights listener I mean averaging one person doesn't really do much but will have an idea of what they want first and then go look for that thing.

267
00:19:10,021 --> 00:19:16,694
Speaker 1: but mass market purchasing by non experts of any good is primarily driven by.

268
00:19:16,714 --> 00:19:20,589
Speaker 1: I want thing and then it seems to be almost random.

269
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:23,058
Speaker 1: which Iteration of that thing they actually end up buying?

270
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:34,067
Speaker 0: like marketing drives them what happens to be in a store They physically visit drives them and it's like alright, we're gonna buy, you know They just think I want to buy a big new TV and they go to.

271
00:19:34,087 --> 00:19:36,737
Speaker 0: you know But they don't whereas we're like.

272
00:19:37,138 --> 00:19:38,642
Speaker 0: I want to get this exact.

273
00:19:38,723 --> 00:19:41,010
Speaker 0: I want to actually know what OLED means.

274
00:19:41,090 --> 00:19:45,245
Speaker 1: Like if I ever bought a car again, I'll go to a fucking dealership.

275
00:19:45,366 --> 00:19:46,470
Speaker 1: I'm gonna know in advance.

276
00:19:46,671 --> 00:19:51,448
Speaker 1: I want this specific make model color feature set and I'm going to buy it.

277
00:19:51,588 --> 00:19:52,030
Speaker 1: and that's it.

278
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:52,392
Speaker 1: Like.

279
00:19:52,412 --> 00:19:53,015
Speaker 1: there's like.

280
00:19:53,055 --> 00:19:54,302
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna talk to a human being.

281
00:19:54,322 --> 00:19:55,770
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to buy it online if I can.

282
00:19:56,711 --> 00:19:56,872
Speaker 0: Yep.

283
00:19:57,494 --> 00:20:02,190
Speaker 1: All right some other news, you know, we always said Twitter can't make money because you're the products.

284
00:20:02,592 --> 00:20:04,341
Speaker 1: Well, mm-hmm Twitter's getting desperate.

285
00:20:04,582 --> 00:20:05,969
Speaker 1: They're really trying to make money.

286
00:20:06,351 --> 00:20:12,890
Speaker 1: They're going to now allow people to have a subscription where I could say some of my tweets.

287
00:20:13,232 --> 00:20:17,010
Speaker 1: You have to be paying me a monthly price to be able to see those tweets.

288
00:20:17,792 --> 00:20:24,702
Speaker 0: So the twitch model the twitch model aka the patreon model aka subscribe to my you subscribe to my tweets And then Twitter takes a cut.

289
00:20:24,985 --> 00:20:27,373
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly On one.

290
00:20:27,394 --> 00:20:31,370
Speaker 0: I mean that's that's slightly good in that you're not the product as much anymore.

291
00:20:31,454 --> 00:20:40,910
Speaker 1: Yeah If you block all ads I think most of the problems Twitter has as a platform both in terms of damage to society And in terms of like the shitty experiences we have with it.

292
00:20:41,371 --> 00:20:49,255
Speaker 1: I think most of them would have been resolved if Twitter had charged money for its service in some way rather than monetizing Advertising from the beginning.

293
00:20:49,275 --> 00:20:49,696
Speaker 1: Yeah,

294
00:20:50,097 --> 00:21:05,641
Speaker 0: I what I think is is somewhat true and somewhat good Thinking at least correct thinking on the side of the Twitter people is like hey look, you know We're seeing a lot more popularity on Twitter of like people making long threads yeah, which is like well and it's like.

295
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:11,363
Speaker 0: Twitter was founded on the Only post 140 characters and now it's about posting a whole post.

296
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:12,948
Speaker 0: and it's like let's just go back to blogs.

297
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:19,486
Speaker 1: people Twitter would just link to someone's blog instead of that thread and they wrote their thread as a blog post.

298
00:21:19,526 --> 00:21:20,710
Speaker 1: Now you got rollers.

299
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:23,259
Speaker 1: It's right, but I'm an old man yelling at a cloud.

300
00:21:23,379 --> 00:21:26,350
Speaker 0: So whatever like just let's just delete Twitter and go back to blogging.

301
00:21:26,473 --> 00:21:28,990
Speaker 0: Come on Anyway.

302
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:33,200
Speaker 0: But anyway, but Twitter is correct and wise to recognize that.

303
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:36,409
Speaker 0: that's a thing and that's a lot of people are you know?

304
00:21:36,509 --> 00:21:39,239
Speaker 0: on Twitter To read those qualities are usually quality.

305
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:40,664
Speaker 0: when I see a retweeted thread.

306
00:21:41,025 --> 00:21:42,230
Speaker 0: That's usually the good stuff.

307
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:45,149
Speaker 0: That's what I'm on Twitter for as long as you're following good people.

308
00:21:46,691 --> 00:21:57,643
Speaker 0: and if there were to say You know someone retweets a thread and then it's like oh you want to follow that you follow that person who posted a good thread and it's Like oh, you know that person's posting even more good stuff.

309
00:21:57,663 --> 00:22:06,301
Speaker 0: Just pay like one dollar and it's like That's why like I'm saying this is a or if you click on a thread It's like one out of X and the thread starts off.

310
00:22:06,342 --> 00:22:07,990
Speaker 0: good and it's like to read whole thread.

311
00:22:08,731 --> 00:22:10,035
Speaker 0: Subscribe to this person's Twitter.

312
00:22:10,135 --> 00:22:10,577
Speaker 0: one dollar.

313
00:22:10,597 --> 00:22:11,480
Speaker 0: It's like mmm.

314
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:14,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe especially if it was like absurdist words.

315
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:15,916
Speaker 1: They're like, what are these anti-fascist accounts?

316
00:22:15,977 --> 00:22:19,109
Speaker 1: I follow or a good skeleton, you know, I'm not.

317
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:24,606
Speaker 0: I'm not saying I'm a big fan of that, but I'm not entirely opposed and it's it's not.

318
00:22:24,646 --> 00:22:25,168
Speaker 0: it's not ads.

319
00:22:26,353 --> 00:22:27,864
Speaker 1: This is a good thing.

320
00:22:27,984 --> 00:22:42,649
Speaker 1: We as a society Irrespective of the broader problems of capitalism We have to get some of our technology back to a point where the users pay for a service as opposed to the service Milking the users data for other purposes, right?

321
00:22:42,830 --> 00:22:45,586
Speaker 0: But now there's the question of you know, we're getting to we're gonna start.

322
00:22:45,807 --> 00:22:48,021
Speaker 0: if they do this We'll have to start asking all the same questions.

323
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:48,807
Speaker 0: We ask about twitch.

324
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:52,061
Speaker 0: It's like, okay I'm that people are subscribing to and YouTube also.

325
00:22:52,543 --> 00:22:54,210
Speaker 0: people are subscribing to my tweets.

326
00:22:54,912 --> 00:22:56,297
Speaker 0: I'm now a Twitter employee.

327
00:22:56,357 --> 00:22:59,970
Speaker 0: Twitter is bullshit and they're gonna have all those battles again, right?

328
00:23:00,150 --> 00:23:02,281
Speaker 1: It's like but it also shows a couple other things.

329
00:23:02,522 --> 00:23:10,829
Speaker 1: one Twitter is Probably in trouble and trying to monetize because fleets didn't work and ads definitely aren't fucking working for them.

330
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:14,104
Speaker 0: Just charge money to have an account.

331
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:14,948
Speaker 0: It's that simple.

332
00:23:15,029 --> 00:23:16,635
Speaker 0: Yep and you know charge money.

333
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:28,457
Speaker 1: sauce would be let me it's free to have an account that lets you read and Maybe you can even like follow and reply in some limited capacity, but to have regular full-on Twitter You got to pay like two dollars a year.

334
00:23:28,477 --> 00:23:30,703
Speaker 0: I mean consider this right?

335
00:23:30,723 --> 00:23:41,774
Speaker 0: So tweet bot which is a third-party IO App or Twitter right that lets you block all ads and is just better in most ways than the official Twitter app Right.

336
00:23:42,176 --> 00:23:49,690
Speaker 0: They I had tweet bot 5 Which I only cost a flat one-time fee to buy the app and then you have it forever.

337
00:23:50,152 --> 00:23:55,575
Speaker 0: but they recently came out with tweet bot 6 which is slightly improved and I was like Yeah, fuck it.

338
00:23:55,615 --> 00:24:00,770
Speaker 0: I use this app like more than most other apps, you know They want like a few dollars a year instead of a flat fee.

339
00:24:01,512 --> 00:24:03,729
Speaker 0: Okay, so I got tweet bot 6 for a few dollars a year.

340
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:12,143
Speaker 0: That's money Twitter could could have just had if they would have sold me No ads no nothing and I would have just not used tweet bot.

341
00:24:12,243 --> 00:24:14,270
Speaker 0: use the official Twitter app and paid them that money.

342
00:24:14,390 --> 00:24:16,017
Speaker 0: Take that money.

343
00:24:16,339 --> 00:24:20,213
Speaker 1: the incremental cost of 20 was zero if It caught.

344
00:24:20,273 --> 00:24:26,830
Speaker 1: if it costs money to have full access to Twitter's features 99% of bots disappear instantly.

345
00:24:27,843 --> 00:24:29,030
Speaker 0: Yep true.

346
00:24:29,713 --> 00:24:34,356
Speaker 1: So I think this actually is a good move for Twitter and I think it foretells a possible few.

347
00:24:34,376 --> 00:24:56,120
Speaker 1: if Twitter runs into enough problems of failing to monetize all the bullshitty ways Eventually either Twitter will fall enough to where investors who just want it to make a profit without having to pay back all the VCs could run it and then it could be a real product again or It'll somehow make enough money to be healthy in a way That isn't just trying to cram ads into people's faces.

348
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,309
Speaker 1: that relies on bot networks and outrage culture.

349
00:24:59,852 --> 00:25:01,040
Speaker 1: So we'll see how this all goes.

350
00:25:01,121 --> 00:25:02,550
Speaker 1: But yeah, I think it's a pretty good thing.

351
00:25:02,671 --> 00:25:05,429
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna make you pay to read my tweets though, cuz my tweets are not that great.

352
00:25:06,552 --> 00:25:07,197
Speaker 0: No, there's no.

353
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,627
Speaker 0: nothing I tweet is worth money.

354
00:25:11,234 --> 00:25:13,486
Speaker 1: All right, I think I'll skip one of these news as we go a little while.

355
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:34,750
Speaker 1: one last thing This is a science news partly a health news but also This is one of those things where we talk a lot like Scott will often say things like a new study comes out that proves Something and Scott says but we always knew that Yes We have conventional wisdom But having data and evidence to back something up is really important because sometimes long-standing wisdom can be wrong.

356
00:25:35,392 --> 00:25:40,767
Speaker 1: This is a study talking about running and cycling and the impact.

357
00:25:40,807 --> 00:25:41,630
Speaker 0: Oh, I sent you this, right?

358
00:25:41,971 --> 00:25:42,374
Speaker 1: You sent me.

359
00:25:42,414 --> 00:25:43,521
Speaker 1: this is a great this is old.

360
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,266
Speaker 0: this is from 28 this old news.

361
00:25:46,014 --> 00:25:52,781
Speaker 1: But we didn't talk about it and almost no one talked about it except in very narrow Circumstances, but people talked about you'd probably just didn't hear.

362
00:25:52,801 --> 00:25:54,126
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't follow.

363
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:55,030
Speaker 0: I didn't hear either though.

364
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,600
Speaker 1: So it seems like biking.

365
00:25:56,641 --> 00:26:01,669
Speaker 1: people were talking about it a lot And as far as I can tell the running community didn't say didn't even notice because they don't care

366
00:26:02,631 --> 00:26:02,892
Speaker 0: anyway,

367
00:26:03,073 --> 00:26:22,762
Speaker 1: but basically the study and the data shows that Here if we're not talking about like your physical bodies like vo2 max max heart rate like oxygen processing and muscles Like if you get past the point like you're above the line where you're good at those parts Like you've optimized your own physical body in that regard.

368
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:33,529
Speaker 1: There's a question about whether or not training in a sport Like getting better at the technique of the sport can make you more efficient at that sport or

369
00:26:33,589 --> 00:26:41,370
Speaker 0: better Think think of the vo2 max, you know that your cardiovascular system right as sort of the engine it provides power.

370
00:26:41,430 --> 00:26:41,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

371
00:26:42,213 --> 00:26:43,961
Speaker 0: so you can level up your power.

372
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,870
Speaker 0: You can get more horsepower, right?

373
00:26:46,250 --> 00:26:49,560
Speaker 0: You know, you can make your body just freaking stronger and you have more power.

374
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:54,054
Speaker 0: Yep, but it's how much you know, okay Well, you have this power now.

375
00:26:54,094 --> 00:26:57,183
Speaker 0: Let's say your your your body has a hundred horsepower, whatever.

376
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:59,290
Speaker 0: that is in terms, right?

377
00:26:59,754 --> 00:27:03,357
Speaker 0: It's like okay, well, I have a hundred horsepower But how fast do I actually run?

378
00:27:03,458 --> 00:27:06,350
Speaker 0: do I run five miles an hour ten miles an hour 20 miles an hour, right?

379
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:11,362
Speaker 0: It's like how much you know to convert that energy into actually going right?

380
00:27:11,723 --> 00:27:14,350
Speaker 0: So that's the efficiency we're talking about here.

381
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:27,967
Speaker 0: It's like yeah You can level up your power by working out or whatever increase your vo2 max to whatever your body's limit is based on your DNA and other environmental Restrictions, but you got to convert that into the actual going.

382
00:27:28,088 --> 00:27:31,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, right How efficient are your muscles at doing what they do?

383
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:32,080
Speaker 1: Yep.

384
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:35,830
Speaker 1: So and that's what we're talking about here and that efficiency also covers technique.

385
00:27:36,031 --> 00:27:41,850
Speaker 1: Do you have techniques that could possibly improve that in some way in a measurable way beyond just making the engine better?

386
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:45,770
Speaker 0: So imagine your max could be X and without increasing it at all.

387
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:55,017
Speaker 0: You can just change the way you move your body with a coach and some training and yeah throw something harder further faster Better because so like to do it the proper way.

388
00:27:55,097 --> 00:28:01,378
Speaker 1: if I magically had the exact same body as some professional baseball home run hitter Could I hit the same number of home runs?

389
00:28:01,458 --> 00:28:04,690
Speaker 1: or are there skills I can input above and beyond that power?

390
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,342
Speaker 1: This study shows something very interesting.

391
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:15,750
Speaker 1: with running technique matters and You can improve your physical efficiency by training.

392
00:28:15,830 --> 00:28:23,575
Speaker 1: Your body will change in ways beyond just the engine to make you more efficient and there appears to be no Serious upper bound to that.

393
00:28:23,636 --> 00:28:25,843
Speaker 1: like you can keep training and keep getting more efficient.

394
00:28:26,264 --> 00:28:27,950
Speaker 1: I mean, obviously there's an eventual bound.

395
00:28:28,693 --> 00:28:29,175
Speaker 0: It's also.

396
00:28:29,195 --> 00:28:30,922
Speaker 0: there's also a bound on.

397
00:28:31,103 --> 00:28:32,850
Speaker 0: you know, the real bound is just on the engine.

398
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:42,650
Speaker 1: Yep, the engine's gonna limit you before like you can't get better at the efficiency part But with the gains in efficiency won't matter too much as your engine is top.

399
00:28:42,730 --> 00:28:45,269
Speaker 0: So if you get for the already flooring at the end, yep.

400
00:28:45,410 --> 00:28:52,509
Speaker 1: So if you just keep training and running and practicing running you will get better even if your cardiovascular System does not get better.

401
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:54,336
Speaker 1: but cycling.

402
00:28:54,837 --> 00:29:02,060
Speaker 1: once you get to a basic like a this baseline level of Efficiency and skill of doing the motions of cycling.

403
00:29:02,863 --> 00:29:05,130
Speaker 1: It appears that you cannot get more efficient.

404
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:07,235
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing else.

405
00:29:07,315 --> 00:29:11,487
Speaker 0: Most of the efficiency most of the efficiency of bicycling comes from the bicycle.

406
00:29:11,507 --> 00:29:20,957
Speaker 0: Yep, right It's you know You're just putting that horsepower pretty much directly into the bicycle and it's so efficient that like there's nothing different You can do body wise.

407
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:37,590
Speaker 1: besides put more power into the pedals real It's like you put the power of the pedals there you go, right, you know, yep so the argument that was made then was that if you are a Cyclist and you are training that engine you're training like the cardiovascular system.

408
00:29:38,555 --> 00:29:45,582
Speaker 1: You can actually be more efficient in your training By doing cross training with running instead of training cycling because you can get more.

409
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:48,690
Speaker 1: you can work out the engine more in less time.

410
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:53,430
Speaker 1: Doing more time in the saddle won't actually help you that much once you get to a certain point.

411
00:29:57,093 --> 00:30:00,915
Speaker 1: But anyway What did I have?

412
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,106
Speaker 0: oh, yeah, I've been wanting to talk about this for a while.

413
00:30:05,186 --> 00:30:06,630
Speaker 0: it's almost news territory.

414
00:30:06,771 --> 00:30:15,863
Speaker 0: But then our friend at YouTube a big Clive and Clive my boy Big Clive with his excellent electronics related videos on YouTube.

415
00:30:16,545 --> 00:30:25,089
Speaker 0: He has a certain style that is Somewhat off-putting but not shouty YouTube guy and not wrong and that's why I like big club.

416
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:29,070
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, but yeah, I've been wanting to talk about these Dubai lamps.

417
00:30:29,391 --> 00:30:33,493
Speaker 0: So if you haven't heard right the I guess King I don't.

418
00:30:33,553 --> 00:30:34,617
Speaker 0: I don't know what the is.

419
00:30:34,637 --> 00:30:37,670
Speaker 0: the king of Dubai is Emperor of Dubai Sultan of Dubai.

420
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:38,933
Speaker 0: I don't know what the person is.

421
00:30:39,655 --> 00:30:45,030
Speaker 0: I'm sorry person who runs Dubai, but also I'm not sorry because you're sometimes doing bad things.

422
00:30:45,992 --> 00:30:57,807
Speaker 0: But a somewhat bad Good thing you've done is you ordered The creation by Commission and partnership with Phillips the company that makes light bulbs.

423
00:30:57,827 --> 00:31:02,150
Speaker 0: that are a million other things These light bulbs and you have a license on them.

424
00:31:02,190 --> 00:31:07,780
Speaker 0: So now they're your light bulbs and they're not sold anywhere else in the world And it's hard to get them anywhere else in the world.

425
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,629
Speaker 0: You have to like get them sent from Dubai.

426
00:31:11,312 --> 00:31:14,605
Speaker 0: And basically he was like, yeah, I want more efficient air efficiency.

427
00:31:14,645 --> 00:31:15,690
Speaker 0: again to the topic of the day.

428
00:31:16,434 --> 00:31:18,730
Speaker 0: He wanted more efficient light bulbs in Dubai.

429
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:28,589
Speaker 0: All right The LED ones were not that efficient in terms of watts per I guess lumen or however, you're gonna measure it Right, you want to you know, and he wanted light bulbs that lasted longer.

430
00:31:29,333 --> 00:31:46,650
Speaker 0: So if you look at LED light bulbs that you get in, you know Local store in not Dubai anyone who lives outside Dubai, which is imagine 99.99 percent of our listenership if not a hundred You're gonna see that there's actually very few LEDs in there.

431
00:31:46,750 --> 00:31:53,697
Speaker 0: They're running those LEDs kind of hot to put out more light and as a result They sort of burn out faster.

432
00:31:53,778 --> 00:32:07,170
Speaker 0: not that they burn out as fast as like old filament light bulbs, which burn out super fast But they won't last as long as you're running them hot and you're getting you know Less light per watt per electricity that you're putting into the bulb.

433
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:10,290
Speaker 0: So, how did they solve this in Dubai?

434
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:15,870
Speaker 0: They basically just made light bulbs and big Clive does nice teardown explaining everything about these light bulbs.

435
00:32:16,293 --> 00:32:18,349
Speaker 0: They just put more LEDs in there and ran them lower.

436
00:32:19,751 --> 00:32:23,523
Speaker 0: They put less power into each LED, but there's more of them.

437
00:32:23,965 --> 00:32:25,610
Speaker 0: So you're getting more light.

438
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:26,794
Speaker 0: You're not getting necessarily.

439
00:32:26,935 --> 00:32:27,095
Speaker 0: each.

440
00:32:27,216 --> 00:32:36,770
Speaker 0: each individual right diode is putting out less light But there's more of them and each one is getting less power to it, but there's more of them, right?

441
00:32:37,592 --> 00:32:43,937
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's a more efficient bulb with more right that lasts longer Because you're running them cooler, right?

442
00:32:43,957 --> 00:32:46,585
Speaker 0: They're not heating up so much taking more damage over time.

443
00:32:46,625 --> 00:32:47,970
Speaker 0: These bulbs probably last forever.

444
00:32:48,973 --> 00:32:57,388
Speaker 0: But then again if you're anyone in Dubai You now basically by decree only have three light bulbs or to choose from there for light bulbs to choose from.

445
00:32:57,408 --> 00:32:58,190
Speaker 0: that's it.

446
00:32:58,311 --> 00:33:00,329
Speaker 0: They had to use this light bulb everywhere in Dubai.

447
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:04,528
Speaker 0: You can't use any other kind of light bulb anymore, right?

448
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:20,619
Speaker 0: the end Which rules out a lot of different styles of light bulb, but it's really fascinating and it's also questionable Right as to whether this is actually better or not because on the one hand Let's say the whole world had the same decree.

449
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:21,001
Speaker 0: right.

450
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:23,390
Speaker 0: use these Dubai lamps everywhere on earth, right?

451
00:33:24,111 --> 00:33:26,620
Speaker 0: That would be very power efficient.

452
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,530
Speaker 0: It would save us a lot of electricity coming from the power plants, right?

453
00:33:29,953 --> 00:33:40,996
Speaker 0: Whatever are powering our power plants we would be able to cut down on that and that's a good thing in terms of the environment, but We'd have to make a lot more LEDs right?

454
00:33:41,076 --> 00:33:47,003
Speaker 0: each one of these bulbs has way more LEDs in it and there's a materials and Manufacturing cost that goes into making these.

455
00:33:47,023 --> 00:33:48,370
Speaker 0: they're more expensive to buy.

456
00:33:49,851 --> 00:33:58,345
Speaker 0: Even if that you could get them there are a few dollars more than the other normal style now I have ever read about like the transition to CFLs and LEDs so far.

457
00:33:58,526 --> 00:34:12,070
Speaker 1: is that because incandescent bulbs used so much electricity that Nearly unlimited mining and supply chain to make these things as long as they last long enough in general is worth it.

458
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:21,032
Speaker 0: But I'm not comparing these to the old light bulbs and comparing these Dubai LED lamps to the ones we have which are also LEDs.

459
00:34:21,052 --> 00:34:21,895
Speaker 0: just less efficient.

460
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:26,570
Speaker 0: right because what if I get less efficient LEDs, but there's less LEDs in there?

461
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:29,982
Speaker 0: So the manufacturing there's like way less materials used.

462
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:32,250
Speaker 0: we can get like four or five bulbs instead of one.

463
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the fact that they were out faster is the real problem.

464
00:34:35,384 --> 00:34:47,527
Speaker 0: where our faster is true But you could power them right with like a solar Cell and it doesn't matter if it's more or less efficient really because if as long as you have sufficient power to power it You know, it's green energy, right?

465
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:55,760
Speaker 0: Manufacturing any of them is not you know, even if the power even if the factory was run on solar cells The materials are still mined.

466
00:34:55,940 --> 00:34:59,278
Speaker 0: Yeah at some point so It's questionable.

467
00:34:59,318 --> 00:35:06,610
Speaker 0: I don't know so I do the math on that But it's still fascinating and big Clive here will break down the circuitry for you, which is also fascinating.

468
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:07,936
Speaker 1: It's interesting because in my own life.

469
00:35:08,016 --> 00:35:18,009
Speaker 1: I've transitioned almost all my lights increasingly to Intrinsic lighting fixtures that have like their own inbuilt like a raise of LEDs that are not replaceable.

470
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:22,336
Speaker 1: hmm So, uh, I think of the day.

471
00:35:22,637 --> 00:35:28,393
Speaker 1: it's something that is not like it's not good and you probably shouldn't use it But it's neat.

472
00:35:28,975 --> 00:35:40,130
Speaker 1: So you might have noticed that whole hubbub about game stonk Game stock stocks and all the stock market nonsense going on and the diamond holds and all this Rocket ships.

473
00:35:41,731 --> 00:35:54,850
Speaker 1: so a lot of nerds are really into trying to trade in the stock market and trying to make money with Cryptocurrencies which we'll get into in the main bit and some enterprising nerd has made what they're calling the game stonk terminal.

474
00:35:54,890 --> 00:35:56,749
Speaker 1: I want to read this about because it's really really short.

475
00:35:57,312 --> 00:36:02,110
Speaker 1: Game stock terminal is an awesome stock and crypto market terminal that is developed for fun.

476
00:36:02,571 --> 00:36:08,990
Speaker 1: When I saw my GME shares tanking the implementation and Python allows to easily add more commands expand on the configuration.

477
00:36:09,593 --> 00:36:10,680
Speaker 1: Feel free to make requests.

478
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,270
Speaker 1: I'm happy to work on them in my spare time.

479
00:36:13,251 --> 00:36:16,163
Speaker 1: It's basically the way people are talking about it is.

480
00:36:16,464 --> 00:36:21,369
Speaker 1: it's a quote Bloomberg terminal But it's open and it's for the masses and anyone can just use it.

481
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:25,039
Speaker 0: Well has an interface similar to a Bloomberg job.

482
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:30,558
Speaker 1: It's a command line interface where you can type stuff and See stock stuff.

483
00:36:31,321 --> 00:36:35,879
Speaker 0: So if you were used to using a Bloomberg terminal You might come to get a similar user

484
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,730
Speaker 1: really worthless if you're used to losing a Bloomberg terminal because here's

485
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:43,029
Speaker 0: But I'm saying the user experience in terms of like, you know, the interface

486
00:36:44,531 --> 00:36:44,873
Speaker 1: Because I'm

487
00:36:45,174 --> 00:36:48,469
Speaker 0: trying to mimic it right the same way like, you know, this

488
00:36:48,509 --> 00:36:48,589
Speaker 1: is

489
00:36:48,629 --> 00:36:50,452
Speaker 0: why Windows

490
00:36:50,834 --> 00:36:59,019
Speaker 1: the way people are talking about this thing like oh, yeah, it's like a Bloomberg terminal Using it and looking at it and like seeing the way people are talking about it and what it is.

491
00:36:59,040 --> 00:37:44,699
Speaker 1: I Equivalent of Stock market interactions like this is like this is the kind of tool someone would make if they had seen what stock market stuff looks like but didn't actually Understand how and why people trade stocks and tried to make something that had the visual aesthetic of a tool they happen to have seen Because basically all it lets you do is use a kind of mediocre Command-line interface to make it draw charts of stock prices and run really simplistic Regression models against those prices and look up publicly available data from like sources out there Things like the Bloomberg terminal.

492
00:37:45,101 --> 00:37:46,850
Speaker 1: that interface is not what people pay for.

493
00:37:46,971 --> 00:37:48,760
Speaker 1: Nobody's paying to have something.

494
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,590
Speaker 0: get that for free from Yahoo Finance.

495
00:37:50,717 --> 00:37:53,418
Speaker 1: Yeah Yahoo Finance does more than this little terminal.

496
00:37:53,438 --> 00:37:57,190
Speaker 1: does people pay for those types of services because they give you data?

497
00:37:57,551 --> 00:38:10,082
Speaker 1: The data is the only thing anyone wants with any one of these platforms out there and this is the interface That is superficially similar to one of those platforms, but without any of that data.

498
00:38:10,123 --> 00:38:11,185
Speaker 1: That's actually worth anything.

499
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:16,150
Speaker 0: I Think that you know, that's someone who hasn't used one of those things, right?

500
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:18,216
Speaker 0: It's just some day trading game stop buying.

501
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:22,690
Speaker 0: person doesn't really know what's you know going on and it's extra fascinating to see what?

502
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:33,566
Speaker 1: commands were implemented first based on what people care about because they have this section called due diligence where you can like Type the word news to see the latest news for some company or

503
00:38:33,847 --> 00:38:34,429
Speaker 0: type the word

504
00:38:35,591 --> 00:38:42,370
Speaker 1: To see your recent posts on reddit about this company or type the word short to see the short interest in this company.

505
00:38:42,872 --> 00:38:54,296
Speaker 1: like that stuff's just in Yahoo or Google or Google Finance or whatever and No one who would use a tool like this has any idea how to actually use any of the information they would get out of It to make a stock trade.

506
00:38:54,537 --> 00:38:57,630
Speaker 1: a human being is not looking at stuff like this to make stock trades.

507
00:38:57,972 --> 00:39:00,870
Speaker 1: This is like you're just a hobbyist playing a game and you're gonna fuck yourself over.

508
00:39:01,192 --> 00:39:01,979
Speaker 1: Don't trade stocks.

509
00:39:02,019 --> 00:39:05,712
Speaker 1: If you don't know what you're doing Don't trade stocks period yeah.

510
00:39:06,032 --> 00:39:11,499
Speaker 1: Well, let some like 401k trade them for you in the meta moment.

511
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:20,438
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh, I do have a metamom whoa, whoa.

512
00:39:22,042 --> 00:39:23,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, so I found out.

513
00:39:25,223 --> 00:39:35,719
Speaker 0: You know since I was spending a lot more time playing video games I was poking around steam and I was cleaning out my steam friends list because I had way too many steam friends And it was hard to find actual friends in that list.

514
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:42,420
Speaker 0: So I sorted it out a whole bunch and I'm sorry if I unfriended you because there were a lot of people who's done names.

515
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,649
Speaker 0: I'm like, I think that's a listener, but I don't know them and it's not like I'm playing games with them or messaging them Or anything, right?

516
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:48,960
Speaker 0: So why are my friends with them on Steam?

517
00:39:50,202 --> 00:39:51,531
Speaker 0: So I unfriended a lot of people.

518
00:39:51,672 --> 00:39:56,094
Speaker 0: if you want to be my steam friend You can just message me on any platform and I will be a steam friend.

519
00:39:56,134 --> 00:39:57,580
Speaker 0: again if you want to play games with me.

520
00:39:57,640 --> 00:40:00,685
Speaker 0: It's not a you know, don't don't be sad You know.

521
00:40:00,706 --> 00:40:01,271
Speaker 1: speaking of which?

522
00:40:01,372 --> 00:40:06,620
Speaker 1: along those lines I I mentioned this in the stinger a couple episodes ago and I posted a few places.

523
00:40:07,202 --> 00:40:11,218
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start up a play-by-mail game of sip six for any of the listeners who want to be in.

524
00:40:11,258 --> 00:40:14,660
Speaker 1: I'm looking for like 8 to 10 players and I will make a post.

525
00:40:15,363 --> 00:40:20,587
Speaker 1: Well, we're gonna do online speed instead of quick speed for obvious reasons but I'm gonna make a Google forum post.

526
00:40:20,627 --> 00:40:27,077
Speaker 1: people can like put their stuff in so I can make sure I am friends with you on Steam so I can invite you into this game when I started up in a week or two.

527
00:40:28,062 --> 00:40:33,600
Speaker 0: Anyway, so while I was doing that I took note of some steam features, right?

528
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:43,537
Speaker 0: and I noticed I've known for a while that there's like the steam curator feature because Occasionally, I'll see people like linking to steam curator pages on Twitter and it's like here's the list of games.

529
00:40:43,578 --> 00:40:46,579
Speaker 0: We've got together We're promoting as a group or stuff like that, right?

530
00:40:47,262 --> 00:40:55,340
Speaker 0: And I realized like wait a minute that curator thing is like a is like a steam Group feature and there's been a geek nights group on steam for like ever.

531
00:40:56,362 --> 00:40:58,028
Speaker 0: It has actually lots of people in it.

532
00:40:58,109 --> 00:41:00,900
Speaker 0: I don't know how people aren't using the group, but they're in the group.

533
00:41:01,902 --> 00:41:09,533
Speaker 0: It's got I think a couple hundred people at least in there And You can make a curator page to go with your steam group.

534
00:41:09,874 --> 00:41:11,160
Speaker 0: So I went ahead and did that.

535
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:19,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there is now a geek night's steam curator page, which I basically included the games We recently talked about on this podcast.

536
00:41:20,843 --> 00:41:22,957
Speaker 0: But you know, maybe we'll do a little bit more over there.

537
00:41:23,441 --> 00:41:25,997
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's about what I want to curate in there.

538
00:41:26,922 --> 00:41:32,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's a. there's actually a whole bunch of features that I haven't really thought about but they're in there.

539
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:34,988
Speaker 0: So there is basically this perpetual chat room.

540
00:41:35,370 --> 00:41:36,433
Speaker 0: That's just always there.

541
00:41:36,534 --> 00:41:38,320
Speaker 0: That's like the geek night steam chat room.

542
00:41:38,803 --> 00:41:40,135
Speaker 0: You we have a geek nice discord.

543
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:40,780
Speaker 0: You can come there.

544
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,975
Speaker 0: I don't think you need to use the geek night steam chat room, but it exists.

545
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:45,100
Speaker 0: It's it's a thing.

546
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,775
Speaker 0: I guess there was a little forum on there with one posted.

547
00:41:48,875 --> 00:41:50,020
Speaker 0: I just deleted that form.

548
00:41:50,524 --> 00:41:52,580
Speaker 0: There's still a link to go to that forum.

549
00:41:52,680 --> 00:42:05,267
Speaker 0: There's like a discussions tab on the steam group, but if you click on it, you'll get an error now because I deleted And they don't remove the tab when you don't have any forums And we can make announcements there as well.

550
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:09,220
Speaker 0: So I am using steam a lot more these days being at home all day.

551
00:42:09,742 --> 00:42:15,412
Speaker 0: So if you want to do geek night steam biz, you know You don't really need to be friends of me directly on steam.

552
00:42:15,452 --> 00:42:18,347
Speaker 0: if you're just in the geek night steam group All right, it's a public group.

553
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:21,526
Speaker 0: You could just join it Totally public.

554
00:42:21,566 --> 00:42:22,430
Speaker 0: just come on in.

555
00:42:22,752 --> 00:42:23,737
Speaker 0: you can just search for it.

556
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:24,280
Speaker 0: There it is.

557
00:42:24,501 --> 00:42:27,660
Speaker 0: You know, I don't think you think you're smart enough to type geek nights into steam to find.

558
00:42:29,081 --> 00:42:38,648
Speaker 0: You can follow the little curator page and then even if you'd ever want to listen to our stupid podcast which I guess you are doing it now, but You'll see when we wreck it.

559
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:39,773
Speaker 0: if we ever talk about

560
00:42:40,034 --> 00:42:41,460
Speaker 1: people in the stream right now

561
00:42:42,501 --> 00:42:48,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we talk about a game that happens to be on steam I'm gonna try to remember to go add it to our little curator page

562
00:42:49,542 --> 00:42:49,763
Speaker 1: Yeah,

563
00:42:49,824 --> 00:42:52,100
Speaker 0: and we can also add like some extra lists to it, too.

564
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:57,423
Speaker 0: We can be like, you know list games Scott likes a rim dozen or something like that, you know You'll

565
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:59,796
Speaker 1: see more stuff up here in there because that you

566
00:42:59,816 --> 00:43:06,120
Speaker 0: can use it If you ever think if you ever sit in there and you're like man, you know, there's a steam sale.

567
00:43:06,180 --> 00:43:06,945
Speaker 0: What should I buy?

568
00:43:07,166 --> 00:43:07,790
Speaker 0: or man?

569
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:13,500
Speaker 0: I really like to play a game right now But I don't know which game and I've played all the games on my steam library.

570
00:43:13,884 --> 00:43:15,580
Speaker 0: Let me go actually buy a new game.

571
00:43:15,741 --> 00:43:20,340
Speaker 0: You can go to the geek night steam curator page and see if any of those games strike your fancy.

572
00:43:20,461 --> 00:43:23,414
Speaker 1: So, you know along those lines actually I'll shit talk it now because I did.

573
00:43:23,454 --> 00:43:24,640
Speaker 1: I've been working on this for a while.

574
00:43:25,041 --> 00:43:30,960
Speaker 1: You know how if you're not aware I put every board game review we've ever done on YouTube.

575
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:33,047
Speaker 1: It's basically the part of the gig nights episode.

576
00:43:33,067 --> 00:43:36,580
Speaker 1: That's the review without like things the day or news any that other crap.

577
00:43:36,700 --> 00:43:53,680
Speaker 1: It's just the review of that game and they're pretty much all on YouTube except a handful of like games were reviewed in episodes from like 2005 where fair like that garbage review we did of T&E as part of a larger episode in Literally 2005 does not need to be on YouTube.

578
00:43:54,262 --> 00:43:56,151
Speaker 0: But oh that does remind me.

579
00:43:56,171 --> 00:43:57,618
Speaker 1: so now there's some metal.

580
00:43:57,638 --> 00:43:57,980
Speaker 1: look at this.

581
00:43:58,321 --> 00:44:01,337
Speaker 1: So that was successful and if you're not aware of that go check it out.

582
00:44:01,357 --> 00:44:01,880
Speaker 1: I'll link to it.

583
00:44:02,463 --> 00:44:18,133
Speaker 1: I am working on doing the same thing for all the video games we've ever reviewed meaning you'll be able to find link to and listen to a The review of any video game we've ever talked about without any of the news and other nonsense as well And I'll start publishing those on a semi-weekly basis.

584
00:44:18,193 --> 00:44:21,618
Speaker 1: Once I get my pipeline completely Rockin and a little bit ahead.

585
00:44:22,682 --> 00:44:31,858
Speaker 0: So the two that reminds me is that in that steam curator page We have the ability to link from our curating page directly to our review of the.

586
00:44:31,998 --> 00:44:32,660
Speaker 1: look at that.

587
00:44:32,760 --> 00:44:35,960
Speaker 1: It's almost like the thing I just said and the thing you just said is gonna make it real easy.

588
00:44:36,081 --> 00:44:40,180
Speaker 0: So when you go to the curator page and you see a game and you're like should I get this game?

589
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:47,000
Speaker 0: Well right there in steam is an embedded YouTube video of us reviewing the of the geek nights episode of us talking about that game.

590
00:44:48,047 --> 00:44:48,580
Speaker 0: That's helpful.

591
00:44:49,082 --> 00:45:09,918
Speaker 0: And the other thing I forgot about is that the steam curator thing has a feature Where people can actually send games to us saying like it's sort of like an inbox on steam on on the curator page From like for game creators people who are making games and putting them on steam to send those games to us and saying hey Please check out my game.

592
00:45:11,962 --> 00:45:13,814
Speaker 0: So I guess you can try to use that.

593
00:45:13,834 --> 00:45:17,432
Speaker 0: I don't I can't promise I'm gonna play your game, but you can try to use it.

594
00:45:17,834 --> 00:45:18,175
Speaker 0: I don't know.

595
00:45:18,436 --> 00:45:19,822
Speaker 0: see what happens Now.

596
00:45:19,862 --> 00:45:22,171
Speaker 1: we got people in the stream talking about they're gonna engage with this.

597
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,380
Speaker 1: I think we should do a lot with this team group.

598
00:45:25,342 --> 00:45:26,387
Speaker 0: Well, maybe maybe not.

599
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:28,055
Speaker 0: we'll see it's low-hanging fruit.

600
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:38,479
Speaker 0: The effort is yeah Right like I'm saying is we on every single platform steam discord Twitter Not so much Facebook anymore Instagram if I remember to use it.

601
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:44,800
Speaker 0: You know ever we are on every platform wherever you YouTube we are there, right?

602
00:45:44,921 --> 00:45:51,090
Speaker 0: So you can come and find us in the place that you like to be including even steam All right, so we don't know.

603
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:57,340
Speaker 1: this won't be a super long main bit But or else we've never done a show on this and I think it is where you deleted a show on this.

604
00:45:57,440 --> 00:45:58,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty sure we've talked about this.

605
00:45:59,129 --> 00:46:06,240
Speaker 1: We've trashed coins in the past Yeah, but what we've never done is done an episode to actually as a main vent like talk about what this stuff is.

606
00:46:06,301 --> 00:46:11,592
Speaker 1: So we're gonna talk about Cryptocurrency like as a concept because it's new right.

607
00:46:11,672 --> 00:46:13,599
Speaker 1: this did not exist in any meaningful way.

608
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:15,026
Speaker 1: It's quite.

609
00:46:15,086 --> 00:46:17,980
Speaker 0: it's actually more years old than you realize at this point.

610
00:46:18,101 --> 00:46:21,114
Speaker 1: But so the in the early to mid 2000s there was.

611
00:46:21,135 --> 00:46:22,926
Speaker 0: I thought it would have been dead by now But I was wrong.

612
00:46:22,946 --> 00:46:24,439
Speaker 1: there was chatter about this kind of thing.

613
00:46:24,801 --> 00:46:33,153
Speaker 1: But Bitcoin like the famous one that people know that kind of kicked off a lot of interest in it 2009 like that's when that appeared.

614
00:46:33,897 --> 00:46:34,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

615
00:46:35,561 --> 00:46:42,480
Speaker 1: So what a cryptocurrency is is actually a complicated question to answer because it's not as easy question answer.

616
00:46:42,660 --> 00:46:57,580
Speaker 1: well, it's complicated if you actually think about what this technology does because fundamentally what cryptocurrencies do is make a Ledger a generic ledger imagined like an Excel spreadsheet literally a spreadsheet.

617
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,939
Speaker 1: Yep, but I say ledger because spreadsheet implies some other features that these don't have.

618
00:47:02,482 --> 00:47:20,140
Speaker 1: but it means that there could be a spreadsheet out there that I can put updates into and Scott can put updates into and Scott and I can agree to put an update in together and the spreadsheet itself will prove Who put those updates in there and when?

619
00:47:20,640 --> 00:47:33,480
Speaker 1: it'll prove that Oh Brim and Scott agreed to put this update in there and it'll prove that those updates have not been tampered with and I don't have to trust Scott and Scott doesn't have to trust me and neither of us has to trust the ledger itself.

620
00:47:33,902 --> 00:47:35,611
Speaker 1: We can write this distributed trust.

621
00:47:35,631 --> 00:47:37,099
Speaker 1: that quote just works.

622
00:47:37,964 --> 00:47:45,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, so fundamentally the principle of the cryptocurrency Right is actually the only positive thing about it, right?

623
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,692
Speaker 0: And I can see why that principle is so alluring.

624
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:54,620
Speaker 0: that has dragged people into it Despite literally everything else about it being absolute dogshit.

625
00:47:55,161 --> 00:48:07,354
Speaker 0: So the principle is like hey if you wanted to set up like, you know a bank or a new currency Digitally the easy way to do it It's just make a server that has a spreadsheet and just keeps track of everything right.

626
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:08,860
Speaker 0: and anyone wants to do anything.

627
00:48:09,362 --> 00:48:13,997
Speaker 0: They would contact the server and the server would say, okay, so and so is given ten dollars to someone.

628
00:48:14,017 --> 00:48:15,946
Speaker 0: so and write it down So and it keeps it just.

629
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:18,780
Speaker 0: they'll just have a database that keeps track of how much money everyone has.

630
00:48:19,121 --> 00:48:20,885
Speaker 0: It's super simple super easy.

631
00:48:21,146 --> 00:48:21,748
Speaker 0: It just works.

632
00:48:22,048 --> 00:48:22,670
Speaker 0: It's just great.

633
00:48:23,111 --> 00:48:27,183
Speaker 0: But the problems with that is who's controlling that server Now?

634
00:48:27,404 --> 00:48:28,369
Speaker 0: can you trust them?

635
00:48:28,389 --> 00:48:30,900
Speaker 1: now the right is the server get compromised.

636
00:48:31,981 --> 00:48:38,800
Speaker 1: We can trust the people running those things for the most sure but can I want to give money to sell someone else?

637
00:48:38,940 --> 00:48:40,110
Speaker 0: But I don't want anyone else to know.

638
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:41,340
Speaker 0: I wanted to be secret, right?

639
00:48:41,741 --> 00:48:43,468
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's all these.

640
00:48:43,709 --> 00:48:45,376
Speaker 0: what if the government takes down the server?

641
00:48:45,396 --> 00:48:46,340
Speaker 0: They don't like what you're doing?

642
00:48:46,621 --> 00:48:54,860
Speaker 1: Well, I guess that's why I wanted to say there was a complicated answer because they call it a crypto currency But all it really is is a distributed shared ledger.

643
00:48:54,920 --> 00:49:08,000
Speaker 1: The currency aspect of it is the use case people imagine for this technology first, which was basically Have something digital that acts like physical cash Yep, an intrinsic asset.

644
00:49:08,323 --> 00:49:18,432
Speaker 1: I'd like if I give Scott $20 Physically the only way to get that back from him is to fight him and take it or like break into his house and steal $20 like I can't.

645
00:49:18,753 --> 00:49:20,120
Speaker 1: I can't undo the transaction.

646
00:49:20,321 --> 00:49:25,560
Speaker 1: I can't like call Andrew Jackson on the phone and be like, yeah, I need that $20 back from Scott, right?

647
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:32,791
Speaker 0: But but if we're using say an essentialized currency like say World of Warcraft gold, right, you know World of Warcraft could just be like, you know what?

648
00:49:32,811 --> 00:49:34,220
Speaker 0: We're deleting half the gold in the world.

649
00:49:34,543 --> 00:49:36,079
Speaker 0: We're just gonna delete your account.

650
00:49:36,662 --> 00:49:41,200
Speaker 0: We're gonna you know, you mind go you you had you had a. you were gold farming and selling the gold.

651
00:49:41,481 --> 00:49:43,369
Speaker 0: We're gonna delete all your account and get rid of all that gold.

652
00:49:43,811 --> 00:49:47,312
Speaker 0: It's like they just run it and it's like well You don't want that you want to.

653
00:49:47,797 --> 00:49:49,445
Speaker 1: well It's something I don't want that.

654
00:49:49,726 --> 00:49:53,500
Speaker 1: some people do want that because I'm gonna make a very specific argument right now.

655
00:49:53,662 --> 00:50:08,100
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into currencies and like Economics in this episode too much, but I am of the opinion that you generally do want Governments and professionals heavily manipulating currency to achieve desirable social outcomes.

656
00:50:09,068 --> 00:50:09,532
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

657
00:50:09,613 --> 00:50:17,660
Speaker 1: maybe in some cases I would like the game developer to have the ability to fuck with the in-game currency to make the game better.

658
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:28,020
Speaker 1: Imagine if World of Warcraft like the use some blockchain Bitcoin technology and literally had no way To interfere with the valuation of the in-game currency, right?

659
00:50:28,540 --> 00:50:40,150
Speaker 0: Anyway, so that principle though is alluring no doubt, especially for you know Anti-authoritarian people which I think people on the far right and the far left are combined in our anti-authoritarianism.

660
00:50:42,464 --> 00:50:44,213
Speaker 0: You know, we don't want Kings right.

661
00:50:44,334 --> 00:50:47,380
Speaker 0: I guess maybe people on the far I do want a king but they don't want the king we have.

662
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:48,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's still.

663
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:55,040
Speaker 0: they're anti this authority Even if they're not and they're anti existing authority, even if they're not anti all authority?

664
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and anarchists are anti all authority, right?

665
00:50:58,020 --> 00:51:07,538
Speaker 0: so there's sort of this combined desire for the core principle, but the Implementation of Bitcoin specifically and many of the followers of Bitcoin

666
00:51:07,558 --> 00:51:08,965
Speaker 1: pretty much all currencies

667
00:51:09,769 --> 00:51:21,907
Speaker 0: pretty much all cryptocurrencies have fallen on this one question, which is the problem whenever you're starting any new currency is Okay, we've started a new currency.

668
00:51:21,967 --> 00:51:22,790
Speaker 0: Well you print money.

669
00:51:22,870 --> 00:51:24,736
Speaker 0: Okay, you printed a billion dollars.

670
00:51:24,757 --> 00:51:25,720
Speaker 0: You've got them in a pile.

671
00:51:26,163 --> 00:51:28,600
Speaker 0: It's like it's not doing anything until you give it out to people.

672
00:51:28,841 --> 00:51:30,988
Speaker 0: How much do we give out to who right?

673
00:51:31,571 --> 00:51:32,795
Speaker 0: who gets what to start with?

674
00:51:32,855 --> 00:51:35,298
Speaker 0: and we're just gonna give everyone in the world One and then that's it.

675
00:51:35,664 --> 00:51:36,480
Speaker 0: Are we gonna you know?

676
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:36,921
Speaker 0: What are you gonna?

677
00:51:36,941 --> 00:51:40,935
Speaker 0: you need some way to determine how much you're gonna give to who like to start with.

678
00:51:41,377 --> 00:51:42,240
Speaker 0: the second problem?

679
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:47,032
Speaker 0: That all cryptocurrencies have that regular currencies might not necessarily have.

680
00:51:47,634 --> 00:51:49,880
Speaker 0: is that because you have this distributed ledger?

681
00:51:50,402 --> 00:51:56,280
Speaker 0: You need people to use their computers to sort of run the ledger and to you know, make it work.

682
00:51:56,561 --> 00:52:00,320
Speaker 0: It's not because there isn't a central computer doing all the work and keep your track of everything.

683
00:52:00,902 --> 00:52:06,179
Speaker 0: You need people to turn on their computers and run software that will make the thing go?

684
00:52:06,299 --> 00:52:08,207
Speaker 0: if not And if let's say only let's say.

685
00:52:08,247 --> 00:52:15,980
Speaker 0: I started a cryptocurrency today and the only computer Running the cryptocurrency was one that I bought and set up in like the cloud just a little cloud server.

686
00:52:16,662 --> 00:52:27,186
Speaker 0: If this currency got popular and people started using it I'll say I gave everyone in the world one one Scott dollar and they started using it Basically trade.

687
00:52:27,226 --> 00:52:33,720
Speaker 0: it would take so long for that computer To do even like one transaction because it's one little weak computer.

688
00:52:34,141 --> 00:52:42,353
Speaker 0: It would be a useless currency because you have to wait for my little computer to do work every time you're exchanging The one dollars that I gave everybody right

689
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:48,718
Speaker 1: now, but even worse now It's basically just a centralized currency again because Scott server is the only server sure like

690
00:52:48,919 --> 00:52:49,240
Speaker 0: exactly.

691
00:52:49,421 --> 00:52:52,559
Speaker 1: So you don't get any of these supposed benefits of the technology itself.

692
00:52:53,423 --> 00:53:02,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the way Bitcoin decided to solve to basically both of these problems at once How do we give out the money and how do we get people to turn on their computers and make them help us?

693
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:05,086
Speaker 0: Run this network of you know computation.

694
00:53:05,106 --> 00:53:16,659
Speaker 0: They combined both of those problems into one solution, which is the worst idea ever And basically they said hey look You're gonna run your computer and help run the Bitcoin network.

695
00:53:17,321 --> 00:53:27,795
Speaker 0: Right help, you know enter transactions and process them and do all that stuff for this shared ledger and We're basically gonna run a lottery sort of effectively.

696
00:53:27,815 --> 00:53:28,860
Speaker 0: right where?

697
00:53:29,921 --> 00:53:35,467
Speaker 0: You know every 10 minutes or so every amount of work Which is adjusted to sort of.

698
00:53:35,487 --> 00:53:37,234
Speaker 0: you know bring it down to.

699
00:53:37,254 --> 00:53:38,759
Speaker 0: you know one per 10 minutes.

700
00:53:39,061 --> 00:53:41,099
Speaker 0: They keep adjusting it to sort of keep it in that window.

701
00:53:41,683 --> 00:53:44,819
Speaker 0: We're just gonna give a Bitcoin to someone who was doing that work.

702
00:53:45,887 --> 00:53:52,760
Speaker 0: You know every 10 minutes or so They just give out another coin until there's a set number of how many coins they're gonna give out and then it's done.

703
00:53:53,041 --> 00:53:56,940
Speaker 0: But that number is off in the future, so that's not a problem yet, but it will be.

704
00:53:57,981 --> 00:54:03,700
Speaker 1: And at some point, but the important thing about that technology is that it's usually there's two fundamental.

705
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:13,829
Speaker 1: There's more than two but these are the only two that anyone really seriously talks about of how to make these networks run either proof of stake or Proof of work because you need to have a

706
00:54:13,889 --> 00:54:14,270
Speaker 0: way

707
00:54:14,672 --> 00:54:25,817
Speaker 1: to get a bunch of people to do what Scott described and You have to make sure that enough people are doing that that there isn't just one sole authority running the whole thing Because then they could start fucking with it.

708
00:54:26,803 --> 00:54:30,039
Speaker 1: So exactly proof of stake is all is the idea.

709
00:54:30,099 --> 00:54:36,740
Speaker 1: and again I'm super paraphrasing here because I don't think this technology is useful or me like for most purposes on earth.

710
00:54:37,302 --> 00:54:41,200
Speaker 1: So I don't think you need to learn a lot about it nor do I want to learn that much more about it.

711
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:48,607
Speaker 1: to be honest, but proof of stake would basically mean imagine if all right, I Want the Bitcoin network to keep working.

712
00:54:49,168 --> 00:54:56,291
Speaker 1: So I keep computers running to make a part of it keep working But they don't use a ton of resources like they do today.

713
00:54:56,934 --> 00:54:58,540
Speaker 1: in order to participate in the network.

714
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:02,515
Speaker 1: I have to freeze some percentage of the bitcoins.

715
00:55:02,575 --> 00:55:12,473
Speaker 1: I own like some real money worth of that asset in a provable way Basically saying if my if the work I'm doing on the network is found to be fraudulent.

716
00:55:12,593 --> 00:55:13,736
Speaker 1: I lose my stake.

717
00:55:13,756 --> 00:55:17,074
Speaker 1: I Cared that the network continues to function.

718
00:55:17,678 --> 00:55:23,870
Speaker 1: thus I have no incentive to fuck with the network because I would lose so much Personally that it wouldn't be worth it to me.

719
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:25,379
Speaker 1: and there's more to it than that.

720
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:27,653
Speaker 1: proof of work is what most of these things use.

721
00:55:27,734 --> 00:55:32,420
Speaker 1: proof of work is Basically solve Sudoku's by idling your car's engine.

722
00:55:33,762 --> 00:55:47,442
Speaker 1: Just do a bunch of worthless computing Mm-hmm and like solve problems that are specifically very very difficult to solve But very easy to prove that someone has solved Mm-hmm.

723
00:55:47,783 --> 00:55:56,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you know we've talked about cryptography in an old episode think of this is like non-reversible math or difficult to reverse math or Asymmetric math.

724
00:55:56,726 --> 00:55:58,335
Speaker 1: easy to go one way hard to go the other way.

725
00:55:58,777 --> 00:55:59,260
Speaker 0: That's nice.

726
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,244
Speaker 0: Like I'm trying to.

727
00:56:00,345 --> 00:56:02,174
Speaker 0: I'm trying to figure out rims password.

728
00:56:02,294 --> 00:56:03,460
Speaker 0: It's really hard to figure out.

729
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:08,680
Speaker 0: It's a guessing guessing guessing guessing guess, but if I get it right, it's very easy to know I have the right one.

730
00:56:08,861 --> 00:56:10,730
Speaker 0: It's like is this the correct password?

731
00:56:10,952 --> 00:56:12,540
Speaker 0: Yes, that's a very easy question to answer.

732
00:56:12,601 --> 00:56:14,799
Speaker 0: It takes to say like I'm in millisecond so fast.

733
00:56:15,281 --> 00:56:20,420
Speaker 1: So if we're getting into that like the real cost and problem with these algorithms and how bitcoins is Bitcoin in particular.

734
00:56:20,500 --> 00:56:22,083
Speaker 1: But they just applies to all of these currencies.

735
00:56:22,704 --> 00:56:24,867
Speaker 1: The problem is that we use the term currency.

736
00:56:24,927 --> 00:56:35,279
Speaker 1: people talk about these as a Solely as speculative investments.

737
00:56:36,243 --> 00:56:44,280
Speaker 1: Yep, people are only participating Because they assume that the value of these things will go up over time and they won't make money.

738
00:56:45,023 --> 00:57:00,963
Speaker 0: You turn you see that a Bitcoin is worth a zillion dollars, right and you say well If I turn on my computer and have it waste energy like in the next ten minutes There's a good chance on entering this lottery every ten minutes basically and the more computers I turn on the more lottery tickets I get.

739
00:57:01,587 --> 00:57:12,419
Speaker 0: so if I can do that Then I can win this lottery and that if the coin is worth so much if I win the lottery and I'm mathematically I'll win about these many.

740
00:57:13,082 --> 00:57:26,620
Speaker 0: so that means I'll be able to pay for this many computers as long as some rube is willing to Give me real money because I can't obviously pay for Or or the person who's selling me the computers and electricity is a rube who will take the coins?

741
00:57:27,322 --> 00:57:29,100
Speaker 0: Right, but in that case, what are you doing?

742
00:57:29,260 --> 00:57:34,000
Speaker 0: So it's paying you in coins to run a computer and then you're just paying for the computers with coins.

743
00:57:34,040 --> 00:57:35,653
Speaker 0: You're doing nothing like you're getting.

744
00:57:35,673 --> 00:57:36,460
Speaker 0: what are you getting out of it?

745
00:57:36,640 --> 00:57:42,189
Speaker 0: Maybe there's some profit their margin of real dollars in there somewhere Of like a spare coin that you don't need.

746
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:43,213
Speaker 0: you get an extra.

747
00:57:43,474 --> 00:57:44,820
Speaker 0: you minted five coins.

748
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:50,660
Speaker 0: It only cost you three to pay for the computers and you sold two to someone else for cash real cash, right?

749
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:52,071
Speaker 0: No one wants actual coins.

750
00:57:52,091 --> 00:57:52,959
Speaker 0: people want real cash.

751
00:57:53,200 --> 00:57:57,100
Speaker 0: The allure of the Bitcoin is that you can turn it into real dollars, right?

752
00:57:57,400 --> 00:57:58,519
Speaker 0: You know one wants a freaking coins.

753
00:57:58,700 --> 00:57:59,845
Speaker 0: They want real dollars.

754
00:57:59,905 --> 00:58:05,374
Speaker 0: if the if a Bitcoin is worth zeroed out the real dollars and you couldn't pay a rent with it No one would give a shit.

755
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:07,224
Speaker 1: now This is the interesting problem.

756
00:58:07,425 --> 00:58:18,400
Speaker 1: every most of the talk around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, especially in the early days was around Using it as a decentralized currency to be a transaction network that didn't rely on the banks.

757
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:29,560
Speaker 1: So like I could buy I don't know a video card from fries online and Literally just pay with bitcoins and have an intrinsic cash like transaction online.

758
00:58:30,162 --> 00:58:46,009
Speaker 1: But and that would be in principle would be good especially for doing illegal things, you know, ah, yeah That's that second part I was about to say because the problem with cash based transactions is that they're non reversibility and Difficult of traceability difficulty of traceability.

759
00:58:46,791 --> 00:58:54,170
Speaker 1: it causes a lot more problems than it solves Because you're basically just saying hey, all right, right.

760
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:58,929
Speaker 0: you think about a normal person, you know doing anonymous transactions Maybe buy some weed or something.

761
00:58:58,969 --> 00:59:00,236
Speaker 0: It's like, okay cool, whatever.

762
00:59:00,276 --> 00:59:04,011
Speaker 0: All right, but Usually it's gonna be money laundering, right?

763
00:59:04,111 --> 00:59:06,500
Speaker 0: It's gonna be real crime that you don't want happening.

764
00:59:06,801 --> 00:59:07,824
Speaker 0: It's not right.

765
00:59:08,205 --> 00:59:13,766
Speaker 0: and then any normal person it's like average person can just use regular cash.

766
00:59:13,968 --> 00:59:17,184
Speaker 1: it's That's like the.

767
00:59:17,265 --> 00:59:25,410
Speaker 1: all the arguments as to why we would want to use a cryptographic intrinsic currency are Pretty specious at best because most of the arguments are around.

768
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:31,598
Speaker 1: Oh, well, you don't want the payment processors to control things While you avoided some payment processing fees.

769
00:59:31,659 --> 00:59:32,895
Speaker 0: great Yeah, but you know.

770
00:59:33,360 --> 00:59:41,900
Speaker 1: but those fees arguably pay for that system existing and working in the first place and The incremental cost to individual users is relatively low.

771
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:53,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, also it's like, you know, you could you know, even if the the coin network Right wasn't eating up all the power on earth and causing heart horrific climate You know change if it was just.

772
00:59:53,967 --> 00:59:56,540
Speaker 0: you know, a few computers, you know, a few people did it.

773
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:56,761
Speaker 0: It was.

774
00:59:56,881 --> 00:59:58,266
Speaker 0: it was all good right?

775
00:59:58,286 --> 01:00:04,353
Speaker 0: the the fact that the value of the coins is constantly changing Makes them not a good currency.

776
01:00:04,373 --> 01:00:05,420
Speaker 0: Yeah volatile.

777
01:00:05,741 --> 01:00:16,681
Speaker 1: I might try to buy pizza from like the local pizza shop and by the time the transaction finishes Bitcoin went up a thousand dollars and now I've literally paid a hundred bucks for my pizza or Right.

778
01:00:16,701 --> 01:00:22,620
Speaker 0: So currencies that you actually use for buying and selling goods on a frequent basis need to be relatively stable.

779
01:00:22,720 --> 01:00:24,560
Speaker 0: They don't need to be absolutely stable, right?

780
01:00:24,740 --> 01:00:30,079
Speaker 0: You know as they need to be predictable even if they are not necessarily stable, right?

781
01:00:33,242 --> 01:00:41,289
Speaker 0: Right if the value of a dollar is like dropping precipitously people rush out to spend dollars really quick Right before they're not worth anything.

782
01:00:41,330 --> 01:00:41,751
Speaker 0: It's like quick.

783
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:42,354
Speaker 0: Give me that pizza.

784
01:00:42,374 --> 01:00:45,289
Speaker 0: That means this value isn't changing But the dollar is becoming worthless quick.

785
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:46,335
Speaker 0: Take my dollars, right?

786
01:00:46,556 --> 01:00:47,019
Speaker 0: I don't want them.

787
01:00:47,482 --> 01:00:50,139
Speaker 0: But if the value is rising people just hoard it.

788
01:00:50,421 --> 01:00:53,300
Speaker 0: They just put that shit in the mattress and they wait and they don't buy anything.

789
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:54,485
Speaker 1: Oh, this is even worse than that.

790
01:00:54,585 --> 01:00:57,156
Speaker 1: cash and crypto currencies have this fundamental problem.

791
01:00:57,176 --> 01:00:57,979
Speaker 1: They're intrinsic, right?

792
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:01,990
Speaker 1: So even it even if they're super volatile or not vols save.

793
01:01:02,010 --> 01:01:03,775
Speaker 1: they were perfectly like a one.

794
01:01:03,795 --> 01:01:08,615
Speaker 1: Bitcoin was worth one dollar and that Was magically like real didn't have to worry lost it in.

795
01:01:08,856 --> 01:01:09,459
Speaker 1: they locked it in.

796
01:01:09,479 --> 01:01:12,018
Speaker 1: somehow It's still cash.

797
01:01:12,564 --> 01:01:14,300
Speaker 1: Cash can be stolen.

798
01:01:14,903 --> 01:01:16,972
Speaker 1: You can rob someone of cash.

799
01:01:17,193 --> 01:01:18,840
Speaker 1: cash can be lost in a fire.

800
01:01:19,281 --> 01:01:25,720
Speaker 1: How many bitcoins are buried in a kiss an encrypted hard drive where someone forgot the password?

801
01:01:26,860 --> 01:01:31,120
Speaker 0: Yep, there's a lot of bitcoins that are just gone cuz someone forgot lost the encryption key and that's it.

802
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,658
Speaker 0: There's no way to get them out the whole unless you I guess you could try to brew.

803
01:01:34,678 --> 01:01:46,494
Speaker 0: I wonder If we could like find see but thing is I think that would cost more than just mining coins is if you could find some Abandoned coins and try to mine the key to try to unlock.

804
01:01:46,554 --> 01:01:48,259
Speaker 1: there are people doing just that.

805
01:01:49,043 --> 01:01:49,988
Speaker 0: Okay, but it's like.

806
01:01:50,069 --> 01:01:51,980
Speaker 0: I think it might be more efficient just mine coins.

807
01:01:52,061 --> 01:01:53,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, isn't efficient at all.

808
01:01:53,961 --> 01:02:05,020
Speaker 1: But effectively all the arguments for crypto current currencies being used as actual currencies for the most part have been ridiculous Because in practice no one gives a shit about these as currencies.

809
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,400
Speaker 1: They don't solve any problem that most people have.

810
01:02:08,522 --> 01:02:12,620
Speaker 1: The way people buy and sell things actually works really well today for the most part.

811
01:02:13,982 --> 01:02:18,560
Speaker 1: So as speculative instruments, like yeah, they're just a bubble like all bubbles.

812
01:02:18,661 --> 01:02:22,159
Speaker 1: They're not worth anything and someday this whole particular system is gonna come crashing down.

813
01:02:22,802 --> 01:02:34,120
Speaker 1: But good the third problem is that because we're using these proof-of-work algorithms Not only did they not solve a problem people actually have but they are literally destroying the earth.

814
01:02:35,116 --> 01:02:44,419
Speaker 0: Yep Using the Bitcoin that people are spending more electricity Mining coins than like entire country's worth of people, right?

815
01:02:46,639 --> 01:02:47,463
Speaker 0: I Think it's like you.

816
01:02:47,503 --> 01:02:48,447
Speaker 0: basically I think is you just?

817
01:02:48,949 --> 01:02:53,320
Speaker 0: I really don't have a problem with going around and just like if you're mining Coins, we just confiscate all your computers.

818
01:02:53,741 --> 01:03:06,688
Speaker 1: I honestly think the governments of the world should make it illegal to use and interact with the Bitcoin network or any proof of work Currency that is traded as an asset like it.

819
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:09,577
Speaker 0: and it's not because it's not because of the principle right.

820
01:03:09,597 --> 01:03:15,357
Speaker 0: that core principle It's very anti-government and I actually agree with that core principle of like yeah, fuck the man.

821
01:03:15,397 --> 01:03:16,300
Speaker 0: Let's get our own money.

822
01:03:16,903 --> 01:03:18,249
Speaker 0: That's out of government control.

823
01:03:18,310 --> 01:03:20,420
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, you know, that's actually kind of a good thing.

824
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:23,254
Speaker 0: The problem with that can't destroy the earth.

825
01:03:23,335 --> 01:03:24,340
Speaker 0: to do that, right?

826
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,240
Speaker 0: I would argue that you have to find another way.

827
01:03:26,401 --> 01:03:33,540
Speaker 1: I would argue that even that the idea of a currency not controlled by governments and experts is Probably more dangerous than valuable to society.

828
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:37,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, you mean yes and no, but it's also cyberpunk cool.

829
01:03:38,268 --> 01:03:38,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's cyber cool.

830
01:03:39,261 --> 01:03:52,726
Speaker 1: But all the cyberpunk cool things are trying to fight against the systems that are entrenched in neoliberal late capitalism anyway Like shadow like oh, yeah cool We got cred sticks with intrinsic digital cash.

831
01:03:53,147 --> 01:03:55,393
Speaker 1: half the plots of that game are.

832
01:03:55,694 --> 01:03:57,920
Speaker 1: let's murder that dude and steal his cred stick.

833
01:03:58,603 --> 01:03:59,486
Speaker 0: So now there's one more.

834
01:03:59,506 --> 01:04:02,660
Speaker 0: there's one more cryptocurrency related thing I want to talk about.

835
01:04:03,402 --> 01:04:05,991
Speaker 0: So this is news literally like a couple days ago.

836
01:04:06,091 --> 01:04:10,169
Speaker 0: So I never knew how to pronounce this this This musician's name.

837
01:04:10,893 --> 01:04:12,180
Speaker 0: It's three LAU.

838
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:17,098
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's eelow or three lau or I never knew how to say this person's name.

839
01:04:17,158 --> 01:04:25,504
Speaker 0: I'm sorry You know, but anyway Basically what what this person did recently is They.

840
01:04:25,684 --> 01:04:30,745
Speaker 0: there's a. there's a thing called an NFT a non-fungible Token.

841
01:04:31,047 --> 01:04:31,791
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

842
01:04:31,811 --> 01:04:33,099
Speaker 1: I'm extra mad about those.

843
01:04:34,143 --> 01:04:34,765
Speaker 0: Well, okay.

844
01:04:34,805 --> 01:04:37,353
Speaker 0: So this is good and bad parts to this again, right?

845
01:04:37,433 --> 01:04:38,617
Speaker 0: So a non.

846
01:04:38,637 --> 01:04:41,550
Speaker 0: so a dollar is Fungible by what?

847
01:04:41,610 --> 01:04:42,900
Speaker 0: by fungible in this sense?

848
01:04:43,000 --> 01:04:48,655
Speaker 0: We mean that if I got a dollar and rims got a dollar right we can swap dollars and we're.

849
01:04:49,297 --> 01:04:49,898
Speaker 0: it's the same.

850
01:04:49,918 --> 01:04:51,486
Speaker 0: a dollar is A dollar right.

851
01:04:51,526 --> 01:04:52,693
Speaker 0: a Bitcoin is a Bitcoin.

852
01:04:52,733 --> 01:04:53,860
Speaker 0: bitcoins are fungible, right?

853
01:04:53,900 --> 01:04:57,859
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter if I have Bitcoin a or Bitcoin B. They're both one Bitcoin, right?

854
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:04,460
Speaker 0: Imagine if every single Bitcoin right was you a unique snowflake.

855
01:05:04,560 --> 01:05:08,113
Speaker 0: So imagine a good example for nerds be Pokemon cards, right?

856
01:05:08,434 --> 01:05:19,060
Speaker 0: So at the Pokemon card factory Instead of printing, you know a thousand Charizard cards Every single Pokemon card that comes out of the printer is a brand new Pokemon.

857
01:05:19,162 --> 01:05:22,650
Speaker 0: There's a million Pokemon and they're all unique Pokemon.

858
01:05:22,690 --> 01:05:25,180
Speaker 0: to catch them all you would need a million Pokemon.

859
01:05:25,361 --> 01:05:29,137
Speaker 0: Literally every Pokemon in the universe is perfectly unique, right?

860
01:05:29,659 --> 01:05:43,200
Speaker 0: So what you they do is they they make a cryptocurrency right not Bitcoin a different one and They make it to where each and every coin in the currency is a unique snowflake, right?

861
01:05:43,300 --> 01:05:49,640
Speaker 0: it's like I have number five and In this way you can do some cool things.

862
01:05:50,101 --> 01:05:57,320
Speaker 0: Right, it still has all the same awful problems of all the other cryptocurrencies, right that we've talked about it already.

863
01:05:57,962 --> 01:06:02,816
Speaker 0: But the sort of unique and only positive feature and this is what three Lau is.

864
01:06:02,956 --> 01:06:15,220
Speaker 0: or however, you say the person's name I should really look it up talked about them is They're selling their art this way and it's basically like hey, we're basically selling like limited edition artworks, right?

865
01:06:15,321 --> 01:06:21,950
Speaker 0: It's like you couldn't sell a limited edition artwork in the digital realm Normally, right, you know if you make a JPEG, it's like you.

866
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:22,853
Speaker 0: just there's an affinity.

867
01:06:22,893 --> 01:06:23,355
Speaker 0: JPEGs.

868
01:06:23,395 --> 01:06:25,040
Speaker 0: now deal with it, right?

869
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:28,712
Speaker 0: But in the real world, you could print a thousand albums and that's it.

870
01:06:28,833 --> 01:06:30,579
Speaker 0: There's a thousand albums the end.

871
01:06:31,201 --> 01:06:40,175
Speaker 0: so the NFT allows you to be like hey here I've made a thousand albums or even a thousand unique songs and each one is right.

872
01:06:40,537 --> 01:06:48,052
Speaker 0: and then You attach your artwork to the Currency coins unique coins and FTS.

873
01:06:48,614 --> 01:06:50,460
Speaker 0: and now look you three.

874
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:57,580
Speaker 0: This person sold them for a cut all of them in total for three point six six six six six million dollars.

875
01:06:57,640 --> 01:07:03,239
Speaker 1: And didn't this use like more electricity than that studio spent in two years to accomplish?

876
01:07:04,863 --> 01:07:08,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like these non fungible tokens are also using a ton of electricity.

877
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:12,020
Speaker 0: They sold a collection of limited edition NFTs for three point six six.

878
01:07:12,241 --> 01:07:20,500
Speaker 0: Also, I want to point out that pundit also broke the record in non fungible token sales by selling 33 unique items for a total of 11 million dollars.

879
01:07:20,520 --> 01:07:26,333
Speaker 1: So the problem with those non fungible tokens though Is that they don't prove ownership or restrict ownership of anything.

880
01:07:26,373 --> 01:07:28,140
Speaker 1: people can still copy the underlying asset.

881
01:07:29,461 --> 01:07:39,465
Speaker 1: All they do is there's one shared ledger somewhere that says Scott owns this one Doesn't mean you actually have it own it can do anything in particular with it Except transfer that ownership.

882
01:07:39,766 --> 01:07:43,459
Speaker 1: It's not really different than a server that just says who owns what scan at what time?

883
01:07:44,901 --> 01:07:51,400
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but as long as human, you know It's the same thing with the Bitcoin if people are willing to put value on that right the same way.

884
01:07:51,521 --> 01:07:56,560
Speaker 0: Someone's you know, this World of Warcraft There's just a database somewhere that says your character has a sword.

885
01:07:56,941 --> 01:08:04,129
Speaker 0: the people at Blizzard could push a button and up do an update statement in their SQL database and give Everyone every a full inventory of every rare.

886
01:08:04,170 --> 01:08:05,695
Speaker 0: They're all the items right?

887
01:08:06,076 --> 01:08:06,959
Speaker 0: It's like tada.

888
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:07,340
Speaker 0: It's done.

889
01:08:07,461 --> 01:08:18,319
Speaker 0: It's completely false scarcity Right, but it's a way to create a false scarcity in the digital realm Which can be cool can also be kind of not cool, right?

890
01:08:19,180 --> 01:08:20,203
Speaker 1: But remember this isn't like.

891
01:08:20,304 --> 01:08:25,340
Speaker 1: generally not a fan of is on this like only whoever has the key can listen to the Wu-Tang album.

892
01:08:25,380 --> 01:08:26,162
Speaker 0: Well, it would be.

893
01:08:26,283 --> 01:08:30,140
Speaker 0: it would be like that is if you did a digital one and you just made one non fungible token.

894
01:08:30,247 --> 01:08:33,991
Speaker 1: No I wouldn't because people can just copy the music out and share it without the token.

895
01:08:34,292 --> 01:08:34,473
Speaker 1: all.

896
01:08:34,694 --> 01:08:41,118
Speaker 1: the only thing the token gives you is You can point at that database and say at that ledger and say I own.

897
01:08:41,158 --> 01:08:45,899
Speaker 1: that Doesn't actually prevent anyone else from having the actual thing.

898
01:08:48,283 --> 01:08:48,957
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe not.

899
01:08:50,027 --> 01:08:52,509
Speaker 0: anyway It depends on what the thing is.

900
01:08:52,590 --> 01:09:01,814
Speaker 0: if the thing is like, you know They use this technology with like those crypto cats, right and it's like, you know You go to the website and is like that's Scott's crypto cat the same way.

901
01:09:01,834 --> 01:09:03,580
Speaker 0: It's your sword in World of Warcraft, right?

902
01:09:03,680 --> 01:09:05,006
Speaker 0: It's like it but I did that.

903
01:09:05,046 --> 01:09:05,569
Speaker 0: this is the.

904
01:09:05,670 --> 01:09:06,554
Speaker 0: you log into the.

905
01:09:06,814 --> 01:09:07,880
Speaker 0: you log into the game.

906
01:09:08,081 --> 01:09:11,920
Speaker 0: The game checks the ledger and now the game sees that I own the sword.

907
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:12,819
Speaker 0: So I have the sword.

908
01:09:13,341 --> 01:09:14,546
Speaker 0: You you get your character in.

909
01:09:14,567 --> 01:09:16,636
Speaker 0: the game doesn't have the sword because the ledger doesn't say so.

910
01:09:16,978 --> 01:09:18,865
Speaker 0: there are I think the ledger as is data.

911
01:09:18,885 --> 01:09:29,160
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of game companies that want to do this kind of thing for skins To have skins be like themselves tradeable outside of the games.

912
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:32,700
Speaker 0: But do you think you just you can just do it the old-fashioned way that they do it now?

913
01:09:33,821 --> 01:09:43,751
Speaker 1: Database all the ways people like to use crypto currencies for Currency like actual currency are just kind of failures.

914
01:09:44,312 --> 01:10:00,820
Speaker 1: all the ways people try to use this technology for these other interesting things It is the use cases where just putting a database in place is Somehow we're like not the option and somehow this technology makes this thing work are vanishingly small.

915
01:10:01,081 --> 01:10:07,862
Speaker 1: There's almost no reason ever use this kind of technology for any of these use cases compared to traditional methods Mm-hmm.

916
01:10:08,666 --> 01:10:10,937
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know like I guess TLDR, right?

917
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:15,379
Speaker 0: I think that all the people who support coins, right are.

918
01:10:16,701 --> 01:10:19,509
Speaker 0: You know some I can partially understand.

919
01:10:19,890 --> 01:10:23,640
Speaker 0: it's like they're so allured by the principle of the coin, right?

920
01:10:23,780 --> 01:10:38,820
Speaker 0: You know Jack from Twitter the CEO of Twitter is one of these people right and that The the promise and the principle of the non-government Give it to the man cyberpunk, you know money money of the people, right?

921
01:10:40,083 --> 01:10:41,470
Speaker 0: You know that principle.

922
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,380
Speaker 0: you can believe in it so strongly.

923
01:10:44,005 --> 01:10:53,431
Speaker 0: but when you look at the reality of How these things work the actual effect they've had the actual results literally everything about them They've lived up to that principle?

924
01:10:53,512 --> 01:10:54,377
Speaker 0: basically not at all.

925
01:10:54,598 --> 01:11:10,521
Speaker 0: Yep They're pretty much used almost exclusively as money laundering instruments for crime or as speculative instruments Yes, and pretty much everyone who's like it's it's telling that everyone who is pro coin is Like.

926
01:11:10,621 --> 01:11:16,359
Speaker 0: when I first heard of the coins, you know people were they always talk about them in the future.

927
01:11:16,439 --> 01:11:18,185
Speaker 0: tense They're like they.

928
01:11:18,245 --> 01:11:19,831
Speaker 0: they see the promise of coins.

929
01:11:19,851 --> 01:11:27,878
Speaker 0: like they're admitting coins aren't there yet Right, like they're basically saying coins suck now but they still believe in them in the future.

930
01:11:27,898 --> 01:11:29,905
Speaker 0: and That's what someone says.

931
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:30,788
Speaker 0: when they own.

932
01:11:30,848 --> 01:11:34,040
Speaker 0: they still own the asset in a Ponzi scheme or when at the top of a pyramid scheme.

933
01:11:34,060 --> 01:11:35,996
Speaker 1: Well, like look at in those early days how many?

934
01:11:36,720 --> 01:11:42,985
Speaker 1: scams and like cyber thefts happened of these digital assets because They're intrinsic assets.

935
01:11:43,065 --> 01:11:44,148
Speaker 1: like you can steal them.

936
01:11:44,188 --> 01:11:47,037
Speaker 0: Yep, but there is no in my opinion.

937
01:11:47,057 --> 01:11:47,920
Speaker 0: There is no future.

938
01:11:48,261 --> 01:11:53,720
Speaker 0: There is no positive future for coins and they're hurting people outside of the coin world, right?

939
01:11:53,780 --> 01:11:58,020
Speaker 0: It would be one thing if you when you did coin shit, you only hurt people who are doing coin shit, right?

940
01:11:58,963 --> 01:12:00,855
Speaker 0: But you're hurting everyone when you do coin shit.

941
01:12:01,258 --> 01:12:13,100
Speaker 0: So Fuck everyone who's in the coin world go to hell and fuck them coins and find another way to achieve Your cyber utopian principles that actually fucking work.

942
01:12:13,441 --> 01:12:24,700
Speaker 1: Because frankly even if there were valid uses for this technology that made sense and actually solved a problem in the world these proof-of-work Algorithms and the electricity they're wasting makes that a non starter.

943
01:12:25,582 --> 01:12:35,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if you want to if you want to set up a currency or whatever Postgres is free and it uses one computer and with one computer you could run you could have like so many users is unbelievable.

944
01:12:36,321 --> 01:12:37,363
Speaker 0: Right, just do that.

945
01:12:42,494 --> 01:12:49,819
