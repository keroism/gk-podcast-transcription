1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,066
Speaker 1: It's Thursday July 24th 2014.

2
00:00:10,066 --> 00:00:12,773
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,954 --> 00:00:14,759
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:21,725
Speaker 1: tonight we're talking about - con because it is an example of Every bad con ever.

5
00:00:22,027 --> 00:00:25,680
Speaker 1: let's do this and long openers really annoy Scott.

6
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:27,587
Speaker 0: I'm gonna find the thing that noise.

7
00:00:27,607 --> 00:00:30,598
Speaker 1: there's nothing you can do that annoys me more than annoys you.

8
00:00:30,698 --> 00:00:34,390
Speaker 0: doing it I'll just do blatant destructive things like break all your shit.

9
00:00:34,591 --> 00:00:35,333
Speaker 1: That's not annoying.

10
00:00:35,353 --> 00:00:36,176
Speaker 0: That's in your bed.

11
00:00:36,196 --> 00:00:37,560
Speaker 1: I'll just call the police.

12
00:00:38,254 --> 00:00:40,464
Speaker 0: do They come home?

13
00:00:40,845 --> 00:00:42,190
Speaker 0: this pee in your bed, and I'm not here.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:44,678
Speaker 1: Oh doll Bob call the police anyway.

15
00:00:44,698 --> 00:00:45,320
Speaker 1: genetic testing.

16
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:45,943
Speaker 1: I got money.

17
00:00:46,124 --> 00:00:48,134
Speaker 1: I could actually make the police do stuff if I needed to.

18
00:00:48,435 --> 00:00:48,696
Speaker 0: okay.

19
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:51,757
Speaker 0: This is water With urine in it yeah.

20
00:00:53,661 --> 00:00:55,348
Speaker 1: Also, there's a camera in there.

21
00:00:55,509 --> 00:00:56,875
Speaker 1: I'd have video of you peeing.

22
00:00:57,055 --> 00:00:57,799
Speaker 0: It's aimed at your bed.

23
00:00:58,704 --> 00:01:00,659
Speaker 1: It would get me enough evidence.

24
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:04,891
Speaker 1: You'd have to go disable that drop cam without it being obvious.

25
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:05,614
Speaker 1: you disabled it.

26
00:01:05,634 --> 00:01:10,205
Speaker 1: oh So yeah, anyway, it's Thursday.

27
00:01:10,245 --> 00:01:10,907
Speaker 1: It's the lounge.

28
00:01:10,947 --> 00:01:14,840
Speaker 1: talk about whatever here on geek nights, so you got any news anything anything.

29
00:01:16,262 --> 00:01:20,239
Speaker 0: I mean, it's kind of hard to do news right now because we're on like the cusp of news.

30
00:01:20,661 --> 00:01:22,430
Speaker 1: Oh, what do you mean every time of geekery?

31
00:01:22,450 --> 00:01:24,179
Speaker 1: We're on the edge of a new cold war.

32
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:32,100
Speaker 1: Multiple airliners full of people have disappeared crashed or been shot down in recent memory, and there's nothing to say about any of it.

33
00:01:32,562 --> 00:01:33,607
Speaker 1: There's a lot to say about it.

34
00:01:33,768 --> 00:01:35,397
Speaker 1: You just don't have anything to say about it.

35
00:01:35,497 --> 00:01:36,000
Speaker 0: It happened.

36
00:01:36,761 --> 00:01:37,505
Speaker 0: What is there to say?

37
00:01:37,526 --> 00:01:39,396
Speaker 1: all right a game came out?

38
00:01:39,416 --> 00:01:39,999
Speaker 1: What is there to say?

39
00:01:41,482 --> 00:01:42,560
Speaker 0: That's right exactly.

40
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:46,313
Speaker 0: The point is to talk about things people don't know so that they learn.

41
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:50,420
Speaker 1: so I thought the point of geek nights was to talk About things people do know for commentary purposes.

42
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:51,939
Speaker 1: Opinions we're not.

43
00:01:53,961 --> 00:01:55,025
Speaker 0: You can't have an opinion.

44
00:01:55,105 --> 00:01:55,707
Speaker 0: It's like having it.

45
00:01:55,787 --> 00:02:01,309
Speaker 0: having an opinion on something like that is having an opinion on the weather like ah This rain it's not good.

46
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,876
Speaker 1: No because you've won.

47
00:02:02,937 --> 00:02:13,340
Speaker 1: if you're into weather That's a fascinating conversation and - if you're into geopolitics like me and scojo We there is nothing any human being listening to this show can do to act on the fact that planes were shot down.

48
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:16,480
Speaker 0: It matters not to their lives in any way whatsoever.

49
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:19,510
Speaker 0: That is not something you want to do.

50
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,854
Speaker 0: I recommend you do not do that.

51
00:02:20,894 --> 00:02:22,780
Speaker 1: we could go and do some investigative journalism.

52
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,185
Speaker 0: I recommend you do not do this.

53
00:02:24,286 --> 00:02:25,008
Speaker 0: anyone listening.

54
00:02:25,028 --> 00:02:28,180
Speaker 1: That's a bad idea a while ago cause some of our friends got married.

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,167
Speaker 1: It was an awesome wedding.

56
00:02:29,712 --> 00:02:30,800
Speaker 1: Scott took some really great pictures.

57
00:02:31,101 --> 00:02:35,740
Speaker 1: I all my pictures are sitting on this SD car that I'm fondling right now that I haven't even put it in a lightroom.

58
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,725
Speaker 0: Why are you fondling things?

59
00:02:37,026 --> 00:02:37,669
Speaker 0: stop fondling?

60
00:02:38,252 --> 00:02:39,759
Speaker 1: That's what I but but black dynamite.

61
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:47,120
Speaker 1: But they last night we were at a bar and they were showing us all the pictures from their honeymoon in Germany.

62
00:02:47,222 --> 00:02:55,880
Speaker 1: There's good pictures But I noticed something in a bunch of the pictures that they did not notice and this ended up being ridiculous.

63
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:57,546
Speaker 1: So there's a picture.

64
00:02:57,867 --> 00:03:03,852
Speaker 1: they're sitting like in a restaurant and they're kind of hugging each other like oh We're a cute couple and their friend takes the picture.

65
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:11,520
Speaker 1: in the background There's a woman with a zoom lens and a fancy camera that looks like it's pointed right at them.

66
00:03:11,902 --> 00:03:14,195
Speaker 1: Okay from from like back into the right.

67
00:03:14,215 --> 00:03:14,597
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

68
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:17,069
Speaker 1: They took a bunch of pictures in a row there.

69
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,480
Speaker 1: the next frame like the next picture.

70
00:03:19,922 --> 00:03:24,580
Speaker 1: She is lowered the camera a bit and is looking right at them and has a raised eyebrow.

71
00:03:25,103 --> 00:03:26,188
Speaker 1: And then the next picture.

72
00:03:26,409 --> 00:03:29,424
Speaker 1: she's just like looking at him like, uh-huh Mm-hmm.

73
00:03:29,746 --> 00:03:38,440
Speaker 1: It is it is a hundred percent her Not realizing that she photobombed them and taking pictures of them doing their thing at a restaurant.

74
00:03:39,185 --> 00:03:41,360
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought that was hilarious.

75
00:03:42,801 --> 00:03:44,188
Speaker 0: It's not hilarious in any way.

76
00:03:44,408 --> 00:03:45,132
Speaker 1: It's pretty hilarious.

77
00:03:45,152 --> 00:03:45,935
Speaker 1: You should see the pictures.

78
00:03:46,156 --> 00:03:46,940
Speaker 1: She's got the raised eye.

79
00:03:47,282 --> 00:03:49,756
Speaker 1: It's it's the raised eyebrow of approval.

80
00:03:49,917 --> 00:03:51,220
Speaker 1: It's the proceed.

81
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:58,600
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah, but no the cusp of nerdy news because the Comic Con is starting Wednesday.

82
00:03:58,821 --> 00:03:59,323
Speaker 1: Oh, that was gonna.

83
00:03:59,363 --> 00:04:01,071
Speaker 1: I was gonna talk about that as my real news.

84
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:03,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, there's nothing.

85
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:07,340
Speaker 0: I mean There's no reason to go to it because we're gonna find out all the news in the Internet's without having to go there.

86
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:14,713
Speaker 1: My news was gonna be that SDCC is happening now, and I think SDCC is actually one of the worst Never have never having been to it.

87
00:04:15,096 --> 00:04:15,439
Speaker 0: I agree.

88
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:30,180
Speaker 1: Well watching Twitter and I noticed that a bunch of people are tweeting along the same lines and Daryl Surratt was leading this charge great that People all the news that comes out of SDCC not just the news but like all the tweets all the blog posts pretty much everything.

89
00:04:30,643 --> 00:04:37,874
Speaker 1: It's pretty much focused entirely on The big reveals and the big like events and screenings and the expo.

90
00:04:38,135 --> 00:04:39,018
Speaker 0: so there's no reason to go.

91
00:04:39,078 --> 00:04:45,420
Speaker 0: if that's what you want There's no reason to be there and you got to be in the room when the guy makes the announcement Rather than finding out the internet five seconds later.

92
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:59,454
Speaker 1: It's interesting that no one talks Fucking anything about like the other events like the panels and workshops and stuff that happens like because any media is only going there To go report on things that they think will make people their media.

93
00:04:59,514 --> 00:05:01,320
Speaker 0: I think it's big Hollywood things.

94
00:05:01,581 --> 00:05:06,340
Speaker 1: I think the attendees who self-report also only go there for those things.

95
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, look at the biggest line is the miss the hall H. I'll be.

96
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:13,818
Speaker 0: yeah The well the infamous Hall H. That was the word I'm looking for.

97
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:17,934
Speaker 1: Yeah But and it was the same thing with the New York Comic Con all those kinds of cons.

98
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:23,800
Speaker 1: a lot of people don't seem to Realize that like all the media and all the people in the world who don't go to a lot of conventions.

99
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:27,150
Speaker 1: Look at those cons like the mecca of nerdery.

100
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,016
Speaker 0: and even people go to other nerd cons.

101
00:05:29,076 --> 00:05:30,280
Speaker 0: All they see is cosplay.

102
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, because they're not actually participating.

103
00:05:32,372 --> 00:05:33,700
Speaker 0: They're just sort of standing on the outside.

104
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:45,320
Speaker 0: they don't really see what's going on and anything that is going on has Nothing that is good to report on in mainstream media and nothing good to take photos of So it basically doesn't get broadcast to anyone who's not in on it.

105
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:47,468
Speaker 1: So these cons basically all have the same thing.

106
00:05:47,588 --> 00:05:51,604
Speaker 0: also a lot of people go to San Diego Comic Con don't know of or go To any other con.

107
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:52,106
Speaker 1: Yep.

108
00:05:52,186 --> 00:05:52,468
Speaker 1: Great.

109
00:05:52,488 --> 00:05:54,376
Speaker 0: It's like the same way that band-aid is band-aid.

110
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,420
Speaker 0: comic-con is comic-con.

111
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,824
Speaker 0: There aren't any others granted.

112
00:05:57,064 --> 00:06:01,135
Speaker 1: I found some people who call other conventions like kinetic on a comic-con.

113
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:08,391
Speaker 1: Yeah, so yeah But these cons You don't go to him to do anything there.

114
00:06:08,411 --> 00:06:16,243
Speaker 1: you go to him to walk in walk around Pay for an autograph and then get the fuck out of there and then all the people that are worth seeing are at other Conventions.

115
00:06:16,624 --> 00:06:18,553
Speaker 0: right Katie cook is some giant ass line.

116
00:06:18,593 --> 00:06:20,280
Speaker 0: It's like you can just see her pretty much anywhere.

117
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,929
Speaker 0: You know many conventions she works a year.

118
00:06:21,949 --> 00:06:24,080
Speaker 0: I remember she does a convention like every weekend.

119
00:06:24,522 --> 00:06:28,499
Speaker 0: Why would you pay to go to San Diego Comic Con to see her when you can see her like in?

120
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:34,233
Speaker 1: Anywhere near where you say there was a time you could say the same thing about Gabe and Tycho because you go to penny arcade expo.

121
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:35,520
Speaker 1: really hard to see them.

122
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:47,650
Speaker 1: Like if you want to get the autograph you stand in that huge line That one time they're at the New York Comic Con there was like no line, and they're just sitting at a table like Yep, so yeah comic-con just kind of sucks.

123
00:06:47,690 --> 00:06:53,592
Speaker 1: I mean it's telling that the New York Comic Con Which is the same damn thing there's no difference between these two for any.

124
00:06:53,652 --> 00:06:55,860
Speaker 0: like actual a New York Comic Con is much smaller.

125
00:06:56,661 --> 00:07:01,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the size of both of them is deceiving because it's pretty much a churn turnstile mm-hmm.

126
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:07,960
Speaker 0: I actually saw a numbers for Anime Expo that were posted that included both turnstile and unique.

127
00:07:08,522 --> 00:07:09,466
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe we're fine.

128
00:07:09,486 --> 00:07:14,043
Speaker 0: They said they said their unique was 80,000 and their turnstile was like 200,000 something.

129
00:07:14,444 --> 00:07:17,752
Speaker 1: you know how you get a unique of 80,000 because they're still missing.

130
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:26,411
Speaker 1: the third metric the metric that I actually want is maximum simultaneous Because that's the measure of how big the con is.

131
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:31,629
Speaker 1: Otakon's 30,000 people at a time But uniques are and turnstile.

132
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:33,255
Speaker 1: actually both kind of count that churn.

133
00:07:33,275 --> 00:07:37,795
Speaker 0: well Otakon's also maxed 30,000 people so I don't I don't know if it's actually 30,000 at a time.

134
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:44,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, well max 30,000 means they sell 30,000 badges and all those people have the right to be in the convention center, right?

135
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,405
Speaker 0: So that isn't that what the unique of anime expos?

136
00:07:46,626 --> 00:07:58,635
Speaker 1: No, so Pax is unique is way higher than his maximum simultaneous because single-day badges I Got through a Friday Saturday and Sunday badge are still three unique people.

137
00:07:59,036 --> 00:08:00,080
Speaker 1: because there's no way.

138
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,580
Speaker 1: well There's no way they're going to count those as one person not gonna keep track of.

139
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:07,128
Speaker 1: well This person bought two single-day badges.

140
00:08:07,168 --> 00:08:08,833
Speaker 1: So that actually counts as yeah.

141
00:08:09,174 --> 00:08:09,335
Speaker 0: Yep.

142
00:08:09,636 --> 00:08:20,558
Speaker 1: They sell single-day badges Nominally and not that not just packs but any con nominally so that more people can experience it But really because it gives them a better number for the people who pay for booths.

143
00:08:20,799 --> 00:08:29,995
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so the one thing that the news that came out of comic-con is actually worth paying attention to right now Besides all you know, all that movie garbage and whatever and shit.

144
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:33,717
Speaker 0: You don't care about new Jeff Lemire comic.

145
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:42,249
Speaker 0: Always a winner, but this is interesting because under read the description Is positive and negative right?

146
00:08:42,328 --> 00:08:43,394
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna read the description.

147
00:08:43,575 --> 00:08:44,519
Speaker 0: It's only two paragraphs.

148
00:08:44,539 --> 00:08:46,219
Speaker 1: All right I actually haven't read anything about this yet.

149
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,297
Speaker 0: So ten year it's it's by Jeff Lemire and artist is this other guy does on Ant Man is it?

150
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:54,140
Speaker 0: no It's from image gets independent.

151
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:59,900
Speaker 1: I type for I typed SDCC just now into Google and the top news is here's Marvel's Ant Man comic-con poster.

152
00:09:00,068 --> 00:09:13,425
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, ten years ago massive planetside robots called the harvesters materialized without warning and evaded the orbits of all the United Galactic Council's worlds wiping out entire planets and civilizations before Disappearing again.

153
00:09:13,445 --> 00:09:14,772
Speaker 1: All right in culture world.

154
00:09:14,812 --> 00:09:16,480
Speaker 1: That's a hegemon star control.

155
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:25,043
Speaker 0: Anyway, you know fear-fueled response to this machine Holocaust the galaxy blamed millions of robotic companions whom they suspected somehow spawning the harvesters.

156
00:09:25,163 --> 00:09:32,000
Speaker 0: all robots and androids are immediately outlawed and ruthlessly ruthless bounty hunters called scrappers were charged with universe.

157
00:09:33,103 --> 00:09:34,672
Speaker 0: Any surviving robots Astro Boy?

158
00:09:34,753 --> 00:09:37,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was about to say well one Scrappers the.

159
00:09:37,626 --> 00:09:43,680
Speaker 1: when you introduce your own proper noun in your pitch of the thing That's usually one of the warning signs of a bad anime.

160
00:09:43,888 --> 00:09:47,049
Speaker 0: Yep The incredibly like like artificial boy Astro Boy.

161
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:53,784
Speaker 0: Tim 21 may hold the secrets to the origin of the harvesters machine Machine apocalypse.

162
00:09:53,825 --> 00:10:04,199
Speaker 0: so we get rid of all machines that are smart and as a result is the most wanted robot in the universe With only his small pet bot bandit and the lumbering mining droid driller at his side spaced in.

163
00:10:04,782 --> 00:10:07,260
Speaker 0: Tim 21 goes on the run before long.

164
00:10:07,361 --> 00:10:17,300
Speaker 0: The entire galaxy is looking for this ragtag group of unlikely Companions as they make their way from one exotic planet to the next with new foes advancing on them in every turn saga.

165
00:10:17,521 --> 00:10:21,393
Speaker 1: I feel like the term ragtag is also a warning sign.

166
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:28,200
Speaker 0: I don't know who wrote the description, but it's It's like every cliche of awesomeness put together.

167
00:10:28,361 --> 00:10:32,820
Speaker 0: So I don't know how to feel about it because Jeff Lemire has done almost no wrong.

168
00:10:32,981 --> 00:10:35,940
Speaker 0: Yep, and these are all cliches, which is bad.

169
00:10:36,161 --> 00:10:47,780
Speaker 1: But when you but they're all awesome cliches combined, which is good But at the same time when you tell someone that something is everything they like combined That's usually what a snake oil salesman tells you I know.

170
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:51,133
Speaker 1: So I've been burned by that before with certain media.

171
00:10:51,194 --> 00:10:52,660
Speaker 0: It's not like I'm not gonna read it.

172
00:10:53,183 --> 00:11:00,919
Speaker 0: I just have doubts that it's gonna somehow Come over the top of saga to become the best comic on the shelf, which probably won't be.

173
00:11:01,922 --> 00:11:02,849
Speaker 1: So it could be good.

174
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:08,698
Speaker 0: so back in ant-man territory I just wanted to talk about comics on Thursday because I think some Thursday people probably aren't reading comics and they should.

175
00:11:08,939 --> 00:11:10,669
Speaker 1: yeah What comic should they be reading?

176
00:11:10,709 --> 00:11:11,212
Speaker 1: the saga?

177
00:11:11,353 --> 00:11:14,185
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much pretty much Saga is the comic.

178
00:11:14,225 --> 00:11:18,485
Speaker 1: or if you have any friend who is like I don't really into comics Just give him saga.

179
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:19,952
Speaker 0: That's the only comic you gotta read right now.

180
00:11:20,113 --> 00:11:28,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't worry about anything else Things of the day.

181
00:11:28,824 --> 00:11:35,213
Speaker 1: so I got a preface this this video is a little special to me because it reminded me of something that Happened to us at a wonderful Otacon.

182
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:38,507
Speaker 1: Oh my god This was like two thousand four.

183
00:11:38,527 --> 00:11:40,314
Speaker 1: I want to say okay.

184
00:11:40,374 --> 00:11:42,080
Speaker 1: This was a long goddamn time ago.

185
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:48,179
Speaker 1: We're at nota con walking around and out of nowhere a dude just says everyone everyone everyone.

186
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:50,150
Speaker 1: Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention?

187
00:11:50,472 --> 00:11:51,699
Speaker 0: So the show time?

188
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,548
Speaker 1: Show time I didn't.

189
00:11:54,589 --> 00:11:57,058
Speaker 1: we didn't live in New York yet, so I wasn't used to show time.

190
00:11:57,098 --> 00:11:57,620
Speaker 1: show time.

191
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:05,825
Speaker 1: So I look we all we both look our friends look and there's a guy and he's holding his hand up and in that hand Is a condom.

192
00:12:06,247 --> 00:12:07,954
Speaker 1: Oh, it's out of its package.

193
00:12:07,995 --> 00:12:09,119
Speaker 0: It might be show too much time.

194
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:19,816
Speaker 1: he proceeds to then pull the condom over his head and Then inflate it through his nose and mouth over his head into a space suit and then pop it.

195
00:12:20,258 --> 00:12:21,080
Speaker 1: and then he took a bow.

196
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:22,444
Speaker 0: Classic parlor trick.

197
00:12:23,005 --> 00:12:23,286
Speaker 1: it was.

198
00:12:23,768 --> 00:12:24,891
Speaker 1: it was wonderful to behold.

199
00:12:25,332 --> 00:12:25,974
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

200
00:12:25,994 --> 00:12:30,759
Speaker 1: So this gentleman on YouTube Has taken this to the next level.

201
00:12:31,602 --> 00:12:36,799
Speaker 1: He put a hat on the condom first and then inflated it using only his nose.

202
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,726
Speaker 1: I Invite you all to watch this YouTube video.

203
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:40,649
Speaker 1: It is delightful.

204
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:41,271
Speaker 0: All right.

205
00:12:41,933 --> 00:12:44,120
Speaker 0: I have two YouTube videos daddy to peepee.

206
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:50,118
Speaker 1: I can't complain because I have often done the two video thing as rim alluded to in the opening bit, right?

207
00:12:50,138 --> 00:12:58,079
Speaker 0: I've been doing more photography, right and Photography sort of weird because it is both science and art at the same time.

208
00:12:58,582 --> 00:13:01,560
Speaker 0: And it's like you open up Photoshop and it's like where do I put these noblies?

209
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:04,131
Speaker 0: It's like there is no right answer where to put the noblies.

210
00:13:04,614 --> 00:13:05,940
Speaker 0: every answer is the right answer.

211
00:13:06,061 --> 00:13:10,401
Speaker 1: The wrong answer is let's make that sky more dramatic Maybe.

212
00:13:10,823 --> 00:13:15,417
Speaker 0: so here's two really interesting videos that helped me learn a lot and they're pretty short right?

213
00:13:15,457 --> 00:13:19,640
Speaker 0: So in the one video The guy shows you the difference between raw versus JPEG.

214
00:13:20,521 --> 00:13:24,297
Speaker 0: Right and basically, you know raw versus JPEG is all about.

215
00:13:24,859 --> 00:13:26,186
Speaker 0: you know He's like how much day.

216
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:30,607
Speaker 0: it's like people talk about there's more data in the raw file Like what the fuck does that actually mean?

217
00:13:30,648 --> 00:13:32,455
Speaker 0: There's more data in the raw file, right?

218
00:13:32,475 --> 00:13:35,000
Speaker 0: I mean, it's the same resolution There's the same number of pixels.

219
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:35,261
Speaker 0: Like.

220
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,366
Speaker 0: what does that actually mean?

221
00:13:36,386 --> 00:13:37,652
Speaker 0: when there's more data in there?

222
00:13:38,174 --> 00:13:44,380
Speaker 0: and he actually shows you What it means when there's more data in there you can make this guy's so much more dramatic?

223
00:13:44,681 --> 00:13:48,086
Speaker 0: Not really, but it's like you watch this and it's like oh I get it right.

224
00:13:48,146 --> 00:13:53,096
Speaker 0: and the other thing the other video is Realistic HDR photography.

225
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,521
Speaker 0: It's like only seven minutes long.

226
00:13:54,542 --> 00:13:59,870
Speaker 0: All right, both of these are like less than ten minutes and Basically, you know you have a raw file.

227
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:00,693
Speaker 0: it has more data.

228
00:14:00,994 --> 00:14:10,737
Speaker 0: if you do HDR you're basically taking multiple photos of the same exact thing and Combining them to have one file with a fuck ton of data like more data than any monitor You'll ever use could display.

229
00:14:10,777 --> 00:14:13,630
Speaker 1: like you can't display all of it right one photo?

230
00:14:13,690 --> 00:14:16,644
Speaker 1: Well, maybe but like you're like you got to export that shit, right?

231
00:14:16,664 --> 00:14:17,910
Speaker 0: So for example, right?

232
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:23,950
Speaker 0: Let's say I take a photo in a room and the room has a window and the Sun is shining through the window, right?

233
00:14:24,370 --> 00:14:29,890
Speaker 0: Well, if I want to see what's outside the window, I have to like ever, you know a lot less exposure.

234
00:14:30,372 --> 00:14:31,275
Speaker 0: You know to get to.

235
00:14:31,395 --> 00:14:35,449
Speaker 0: otherwise that sunlight shining through is just gonna be a big white spot on the on the.

236
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:36,372
Speaker 0: you know The photo.

237
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,925
Speaker 0: you're not able to see anything outside the window at all.

238
00:14:39,347 --> 00:14:41,690
Speaker 0: Even with raw I won't be able to see what's outside the window really.

239
00:14:42,591 --> 00:14:46,310
Speaker 0: But if I do that then the inside of the room is gonna be really dark.

240
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,960
Speaker 0: I like the shadows near the furniture.

241
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:49,530
Speaker 0: It's like you don't see anything, right?

242
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:56,869
Speaker 0: But if I expose the photo for the furniture so you can see the carpet and the flowers and whatever's in the room This is gonna be the big white spot.

243
00:14:57,372 --> 00:15:13,490
Speaker 0: So what you do is take two pictures or more than two pictures and you combine them and then when you're photoshopping You can edit it in such a way that you can see outside the window and inside the room at the correct exposure Which is what it would look like if you were looking at the room with your eyeballs, right?

244
00:15:14,952 --> 00:15:21,511
Speaker 0: So he shows you how that's done and how you can use the HDR techniques and whatever without you know Make.

245
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:26,850
Speaker 0: you could use them to make some things that look crazy unrealistic and like ridiculous high contrast.

246
00:15:26,951 --> 00:15:29,789
Speaker 0: That's you know stupid and tacky.

247
00:15:30,032 --> 00:15:40,429
Speaker 1: Yeah But you can also use it this way for reals Of course those high cut those like really like fake looking pictures or sometimes useful in a sense that like if you take a picture of a big cityscape or something.

248
00:15:41,052 --> 00:15:41,935
Speaker 1: Those pictures are good.

249
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:45,646
Speaker 1: If you want to like use that picture to impress impress people.

250
00:15:45,827 --> 00:15:48,676
Speaker 0: make desktop wallpapers Oh, yeah, or more like.

251
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:53,030
Speaker 1: if I wanted to like try to do something weird like how many people are in that picture?

252
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:55,572
Speaker 0: That's not gonna help you with that so much They would

253
00:15:55,592 --> 00:16:07,337
Speaker 1: because I guess if there's a lot of different varied white like White levels and light levels all over the place in this giant picture I can just have all the data and a normalized view where I can see everything Even if it's pretty tacky.

254
00:16:07,538 --> 00:16:11,170
Speaker 1: not because it doesn't look natural at all because everything is it like the same brightness.

255
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:13,074
Speaker 0: mmm.

256
00:16:13,511 --> 00:16:18,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're not gonna get any more detail really didn't that more detail like that?

257
00:16:18,330 --> 00:16:19,114
Speaker 0: And you're now you're gonna.

258
00:16:19,134 --> 00:16:20,542
Speaker 0: how does it help with counting people?

259
00:16:20,582 --> 00:16:21,768
Speaker 0: I don't know you're talking about.

260
00:16:22,211 --> 00:16:25,252
Speaker 1: So if there's people like in the shadow of a building or not in the shadow of a building You'll

261
00:16:25,272 --> 00:16:26,910
Speaker 0: still be able to tell there's a person there

262
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,392
Speaker 1: Maybe and

263
00:16:27,713 --> 00:16:32,229
Speaker 0: it would only help if you wanted to be able to like see all the details on the human being like.

264
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,766
Speaker 0: oh I want to really be able to see the details in their skin.

265
00:16:38,151 --> 00:16:38,857
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever.

266
00:16:38,877 --> 00:16:54,105
Speaker 1: You know what's funny because I got this drop cam and it's got a. it's got a real set of lenses in it so I can zoom in on the image right but Then I zoom in and it's gonna be all blurry and then I can hit the enhance button because then it'll like focus on that area.

267
00:16:55,191 --> 00:17:07,790
Speaker 1: But if I do that then it messes up the stream because now the whole stream is focused on that area because there's only one Lens obviously and it's a live stream, so it basically has the effect that amounts to the CSI zoom and enhance.

268
00:17:09,853 --> 00:17:11,898
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah Camera's actually pretty good though.

269
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:12,945
Speaker 1: I'm enjoying it so far.

270
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:17,210
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment the booklet book is still a canticle for Liebowitz.

271
00:17:17,590 --> 00:17:19,758
Speaker 1: I've read every culture book that was ever written.

272
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:22,066
Speaker 1: while waiting for Scott to read this book.

273
00:17:22,086 --> 00:17:27,886
Speaker 0: I Just choose not to spend my time on reading when I thought the whole point of this was to read.

274
00:17:27,906 --> 00:17:29,472
Speaker 0: it is when the Sun Is out.

275
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:32,749
Speaker 1: you shouldn't probably shouldn't read read up on the beach.

276
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:34,739
Speaker 0: When have I gone to the beach?

277
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:36,350
Speaker 1: You want to go to the beach the weekend before packs?

278
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:36,892
Speaker 0: I don't know.

279
00:17:36,912 --> 00:17:37,294
Speaker 0: if I can.

280
00:17:37,314 --> 00:17:39,063
Speaker 1: we'll see what could you be doing that week?

281
00:17:39,324 --> 00:17:40,310
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

282
00:17:41,130 --> 00:17:42,535
Speaker 1: Okay, we should go to the beach.

283
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:43,337
Speaker 0: We'll find out.

284
00:17:43,418 --> 00:17:44,120
Speaker 1: go read on the beach.

285
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:47,393
Speaker 1: So yeah, the book is a canticle for Liebowitz.

286
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:50,539
Speaker 1: It's one of the first apocalypse books of the modern era.

287
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:51,400
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

288
00:17:52,511 --> 00:17:54,963
Speaker 1: I hope you know a lot about Catholics or will make a lot of sense.

289
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:57,253
Speaker 0: I Know enough.

290
00:17:57,915 --> 00:17:58,638
Speaker 1: I think you know enough.

291
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:00,465
Speaker 1: no one about Jews also helps.

292
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:01,910
Speaker 0: I know a lot about that.

293
00:18:02,010 --> 00:18:07,473
Speaker 1: Yeah, though the e-book I had didn't actually show any of the characters Hebrew character.

294
00:18:07,513 --> 00:18:07,754
Speaker 1: Yeah.

295
00:18:07,955 --> 00:18:10,405
Speaker 1: Yeah, so that that was annoying just asterisks.

296
00:18:11,027 --> 00:18:13,094
Speaker 0: Oh, okay Well, it's not like you could read them.

297
00:18:13,476 --> 00:18:14,900
Speaker 1: No, but you could recognize them.

298
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:20,199
Speaker 1: It's pretty obvious what they say anyway Even when they're all disastrous.

299
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,226
Speaker 1: we were at Connecticut.

300
00:18:21,246 --> 00:18:21,790
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

301
00:18:22,231 --> 00:18:31,069
Speaker 1: Publish a bunch of data from Connecticut take that every other fucking convention and I'm gonna publish that data in a computer readable format Not just images for you guys.

302
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:39,032
Speaker 1: once I finished redacting it and hopefully enriching it with some information like what categories the panels are in like anime or writing or Whatever.

303
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:40,860
Speaker 1: So, uh, stay tuned for that.

304
00:18:41,262 --> 00:18:41,443
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

305
00:18:41,583 --> 00:18:43,070
Speaker 1: I hope people do cool stuff with this data.

306
00:18:43,312 --> 00:18:45,670
Speaker 1: I hope other cons start releasing this data.

307
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:48,708
Speaker 0: I don't think any kind of even thought of releasing data like this or even up.

308
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:49,957
Speaker 1: I'm pretty confident.

309
00:18:49,998 --> 00:19:01,787
Speaker 1: most counts don't even gather that data possibly because I have asked conventions where we attended and I saw a Staffer with a clicker count the number of people in the room and then look months after the con.

310
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:02,710
Speaker 1: I'd asked the convention.

311
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:10,934
Speaker 1: Hey, how many people were actually in our panel and they have no convention has ever been able to answer that question ever As any.

312
00:19:10,975 --> 00:19:14,070
Speaker 0: well, let's wait for someone to ask us that question to be able to answer it.

313
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:17,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually I had three panelists asked me and you know what I told them exactly.

314
00:19:17,831 --> 00:19:33,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did not give them the internal notes though because the notes are fair and honest honest and for Scott's and mine and Kristen's eyes only Unless you want it, uh, I don't know what I would.

315
00:19:33,968 --> 00:19:34,370
Speaker 1: I'm so far.

316
00:19:34,390 --> 00:19:36,222
Speaker 1: I'm denying it to everyone because here's the problem.

317
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:39,042
Speaker 0: Someone said I want to hear the feedback I'm like, I'm warning you.

318
00:19:39,062 --> 00:19:45,526
Speaker 0: I don't haven't looked at the Panel, I considered but it may be horribly negative and you might not like it.

319
00:19:45,786 --> 00:19:48,743
Speaker 0: Here's the I don't know If you still want to hear it.

320
00:19:48,864 --> 00:19:49,629
Speaker 0: if that is the case

321
00:19:50,292 --> 00:20:01,749
Speaker 1: Part of the problem is that if I just say no to everyone Then I don't have to deal with having to decide if I'll even engage on the next level with someone or I go and look It up and I see like really bad comments about them.

322
00:20:02,412 --> 00:20:09,150
Speaker 1: But - let's say I only respond to people where the comments are good or at least like not bad bad.

323
00:20:09,834 --> 00:20:10,942
Speaker 1: And then I just tell the other people.

324
00:20:10,962 --> 00:20:11,888
Speaker 1: Sorry, we don't have any data.

325
00:20:11,908 --> 00:20:14,657
Speaker 1: that That people will figure out rapidly.

326
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:19,648
Speaker 1: that we don't have any data is code for your panel was so bad that people wrote bad right.

327
00:20:19,750 --> 00:20:22,141
Speaker 0: That's why if someone I say do you really want to hear it?

328
00:20:22,261 --> 00:20:27,184
Speaker 0: and then if they really want to hear it and I warn Them and then I read it and it happens to be a bad one.

329
00:20:27,345 --> 00:20:28,350
Speaker 0: I'll just read him the bad one.

330
00:20:28,611 --> 00:20:36,820
Speaker 1: I also don't trust to be perfectly blunt that that accurate the kind of oh, no I trust our staff and seriously reading those comments.

331
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:39,147
Speaker 1: They're pretty spot-on.

332
00:20:39,267 --> 00:20:48,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Were I to give someone the kind of person who would get the kind of feedback that would make a person like that cry?

333
00:20:49,032 --> 00:20:54,770
Speaker 1: Is the kind of person who would then take the email that I sent them with that data and publish it on the internet?

334
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:58,595
Speaker 1: possibly out of context Thus causing drama.

335
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:02,550
Speaker 1: and what's the number one rule of running a convention club?

336
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:04,998
Speaker 0: Don't run it like - can.

337
00:21:05,098 --> 00:21:06,384
Speaker 0: yep, so - can.

338
00:21:09,091 --> 00:21:14,065
Speaker 1: We're not going to give you guys a play-by-play of everything that went wrong.

339
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:15,890
Speaker 0: you can read that on the internet.

340
00:21:16,092 --> 00:21:18,848
Speaker 0: Yes, we also did the same thing But basically is the deal.

341
00:21:19,475 --> 00:21:26,430
Speaker 0: somebody made a con and they were gonna Make it basically a tumblr convention a convention for the tumblr community and all these different sub communities.

342
00:21:26,773 --> 00:21:29,775
Speaker 1: We talked about this previously Which is not a bad idea.

343
00:21:29,815 --> 00:21:35,756
Speaker 0: pretty much any internet community get you know of any substantial size can have a successful Convention and probably needs one.

344
00:21:35,977 --> 00:21:39,929
Speaker 0: It's not a bad idea to have one, but this is unofficial not run by tumblr or anything.

345
00:21:39,949 --> 00:21:48,590
Speaker 0: and They had troubles all along the way that you can read about online and famous famous troubles right big-time troubles.

346
00:21:48,711 --> 00:21:49,856
Speaker 0: They couldn't pay the guests.

347
00:21:49,876 --> 00:21:51,302
Speaker 0: They couldn't pay the hotel.

348
00:21:51,322 --> 00:21:53,010
Speaker 0: the things were disorganized.

349
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:55,462
Speaker 1: They like panels didn't show up.

350
00:21:55,522 --> 00:21:56,909
Speaker 1: panel rooms were empty.

351
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:02,490
Speaker 0: People who paid to go to the convention didn't get to see what they wanted to see because didn't happen and they were upset.

352
00:22:02,831 --> 00:22:07,089
Speaker 0: They told video game room had like one TV with one game system on it.

353
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,250
Speaker 1: They told the attendees that they needed seventeen thousand dollars or the con was gonna close.

354
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:15,188
Speaker 0: It's unknown if that was a lie, or if it was actually true.

355
00:22:15,892 --> 00:22:19,203
Speaker 1: The generally just drama filled ridiculous bullshit all over the place.

356
00:22:19,283 --> 00:22:21,170
Speaker 0: now this made news on the internet.

357
00:22:21,491 --> 00:22:24,098
Speaker 1: But this the point of what we're about to say.

358
00:22:24,118 --> 00:22:28,390
Speaker 1: the rest of this night of geek nights is that Dashcon was a disaster.

359
00:22:28,470 --> 00:22:29,173
Speaker 1: Don't get us wrong.

360
00:22:29,393 --> 00:22:30,356
Speaker 0: No question.

361
00:22:30,376 --> 00:22:31,701
Speaker 1: Dashcon was.

362
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:34,630
Speaker 0: we weren't even there, but we could tell that's a hundred percent accurate.

363
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,476
Speaker 0: This is a convention.

364
00:22:35,496 --> 00:22:40,080
Speaker 1: where had I attended and bought my badge with cash I probably would have sued them in small claims court.

365
00:22:40,723 --> 00:22:44,605
Speaker 1: had I bought my badge with a credit card I would have charged back the credit card.

366
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:48,520
Speaker 1: Yep Had I donated money to their seventeen thousand dollar fund?

367
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,524
Speaker 1: well one I wouldn't have.

368
00:22:49,825 --> 00:22:51,170
Speaker 0: meanwhile the guests that went to their can.

369
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:52,758
Speaker 0: It was the same weekend as kinetic on right.

370
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,106
Speaker 1: I had it so a co-worker.

371
00:22:54,307 --> 00:23:00,570
Speaker 1: when I came back After kinetic on they were like so uh you were running a convention this weekend.

372
00:23:00,651 --> 00:23:03,212
Speaker 1: It wasn't this one, and I was like yes I was.

373
00:23:03,232 --> 00:23:05,963
Speaker 1: you probably read about a convention on the internet.

374
00:23:06,224 --> 00:23:15,130
Speaker 0: that is not the one I ran But sure enough, but guess that went to Dashcon and did not perform and were not paid should have come to kinetic on instead.

375
00:23:15,270 --> 00:23:17,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, seriously welcome to night Vale.

376
00:23:17,777 --> 00:23:22,008
Speaker 1: I hope it is not my job to invite guest guests to kinetic on.

377
00:23:22,289 --> 00:23:28,450
Speaker 1: however I've told all the people involved that if they I would like them to ask you to come to kinetic on.

378
00:23:28,631 --> 00:23:29,756
Speaker 0: Please come to kinetic on.

379
00:23:29,877 --> 00:23:32,550
Speaker 1: we will not do anything that - gone did also.

380
00:23:32,691 --> 00:23:35,585
Speaker 0: I heard from someone in may or may not be true that you live in Brooklyn.

381
00:23:35,605 --> 00:23:36,690
Speaker 0: kinetic on is a way close.

382
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:38,442
Speaker 0: We'll fucking drive you there in our zip car.

383
00:23:38,543 --> 00:23:39,610
Speaker 1: I'm not even joking.

384
00:23:39,811 --> 00:23:41,500
Speaker 0: I don't know how many of you people there are.

385
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,189
Speaker 1: I will rent the zip van.

386
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:46,727
Speaker 0: Yeah, we will rent the zip fan, and we will take you to kinetic on with us.

387
00:23:46,968 --> 00:23:50,162
Speaker 1: Yes We'll make sure you can still stay in the Marriott with all.

388
00:23:50,222 --> 00:23:55,682
Speaker 0: our staff will give you the biggest panel room At the best time which we now have data to figure out when that is.

389
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:59,981
Speaker 1: yep, oh One other interesting fact before we get into the rest of this.

390
00:24:00,041 --> 00:24:05,570
Speaker 1: so a lot of attendees of conventions Like to complain about shit even when the convention is awesome.

391
00:24:05,891 --> 00:24:10,489
Speaker 1: so I have evidence that these people straight-up lie.

392
00:24:10,509 --> 00:24:22,472
Speaker 1: a Large number of the complaints that I personally received about kinetic on that we you know we were on the panel's department for that Were people saying that an event they attempted to go to the room was full and they were turned away They lined

393
00:24:22,612 --> 00:24:22,672
Speaker 0: up,

394
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:24,236
Speaker 1: and then they couldn't get in.

395
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:31,216
Speaker 1: but I have the data on that and I and I investigated those cases Most of the times.

396
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:34,570
Speaker 1: most of the panels that people complained were full and they couldn't get into.

397
00:24:35,051 --> 00:24:41,610
Speaker 0: We're not in fact full and had our staff had clickers and counted the number of people in that room.

398
00:24:41,951 --> 00:24:45,019
Speaker 0: You know shortly after the panel started and there were seats open.

399
00:24:45,239 --> 00:24:51,689
Speaker 1: so if that is a representative sample of people who attend conventions in general People just lie about things.

400
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:56,089
Speaker 1: However - con does not appear that there were too many lies about.

401
00:24:56,109 --> 00:24:58,035
Speaker 0: well I'm sure you know the.

402
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:01,526
Speaker 0: the 100% precise truth is not what was written on the internet.

403
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:05,724
Speaker 0: right there are exaggerations and Exaggerations for example, but there's no question.

404
00:25:05,744 --> 00:25:06,549
Speaker 0: It was a disaster.

405
00:25:06,689 --> 00:25:19,954
Speaker 1: well So a lot of people were writing like tear downs of - con like as it was happening and what I found interesting was a lot of the things people were complaining about appeared made up or Just didn't make sense.

406
00:25:19,974 --> 00:25:31,705
Speaker 1: like one guy wrote a big blog post talking about how - con was operating illegally because the company that runs it is Incorporated in one state, but then the event was in a different state.

407
00:25:31,725 --> 00:25:32,570
Speaker 1: It's like no kid.

408
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:33,694
Speaker 0: That's perfectly legal.

409
00:25:33,734 --> 00:25:36,606
Speaker 1: you have no idea how companies work at all.

410
00:25:36,767 --> 00:25:37,590
Speaker 0: You don't know anything.

411
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:38,918
Speaker 1: It's like people.

412
00:25:39,341 --> 00:25:49,200
Speaker 1: once they notice this was happening we're going out of their way to like try to write the biggest list of things they fucked up and things that went wrong and I Filtering through all that noise.

413
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,290
Speaker 1: It was still a disaster.

414
00:25:51,053 --> 00:26:01,390
Speaker 0: Anyway, the reason we want to talk about this is not because anything with - con civilly wouldn't care about - con So I'm gonna bring up examples from - chair, but conventions fail like this a lot.

415
00:26:01,611 --> 00:26:05,754
Speaker 0: I've seen many of them all the time Throughout history.

416
00:26:05,774 --> 00:26:07,984
Speaker 0: when we show not a rare thing at all.

417
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:20,107
Speaker 0: a convention is hard to run But it's often run by fans who are not experts and don't know what they're doing but they manage to know enough to at least get the convention to start and get people to show up.

418
00:26:20,688 --> 00:26:26,610
Speaker 0: and then Because people show up and they the people running it fail bad things go down.

419
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:32,130
Speaker 1: I mean, we've been staffed at a lot of conventions Kinetic Con for many years, but also Katsu Con.

420
00:26:32,351 --> 00:26:33,897
Speaker 1: We were staffed for years Oda Con.

421
00:26:33,978 --> 00:26:34,661
Speaker 1: We were staffed.

422
00:26:35,122 --> 00:26:42,587
Speaker 0: Well some other smaller cons You've never heard of and will bother with and conventions their failures are not always total failures or the whole con collapses.

423
00:26:42,728 --> 00:26:44,717
Speaker 0: often conventions Will have localized failures.

424
00:26:44,757 --> 00:26:55,703
Speaker 0: that first Ohio Con we went to oh my god That was the first con we ever went to had localized failures in the video game area Yep, and the panel area people not showing up right.

425
00:26:55,723 --> 00:26:57,450
Speaker 1: a lot of their panels just didn't show up.

426
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,196
Speaker 1: In fact, that's how we.

427
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,990
Speaker 1: that's kind of how geek guide started.

428
00:27:00,070 --> 00:27:03,984
Speaker 0: But like the dealers room artists alley were small because it was a tiny con, but they didn't fail.

429
00:27:04,004 --> 00:27:04,907
Speaker 0: Yeah, they worked.

430
00:27:05,388 --> 00:27:05,810
Speaker 0: they happened.

431
00:27:06,231 --> 00:27:12,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know and and also some of the things that went wrong weren't their fault like the hookers like that wasn't Happened to be.

432
00:27:12,614 --> 00:27:16,649
Speaker 0: the hotel they chose happened to have the you know, or like we went to.

433
00:27:17,091 --> 00:27:23,234
Speaker 1: We went to penguin con in Novi, Michigan, which ended up being an awesome con, but probably the best Unreplaceable con ever.

434
00:27:23,455 --> 00:27:28,830
Speaker 1: the badges weren't like ready and we couldn't like register or go in or anything.

435
00:27:29,091 --> 00:27:31,758
Speaker 1: The con started like four hours late effectively.

436
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:33,363
Speaker 0: Yep, but the con happened.

437
00:27:33,383 --> 00:27:34,025
Speaker 0: it did.

438
00:27:34,045 --> 00:27:35,309
Speaker 1: it did in the end happen.

439
00:27:35,449 --> 00:27:37,103
Speaker 1: Yeah but so - con.

440
00:27:38,753 --> 00:27:52,394
Speaker 1: What happened here is very simple nerds and fans of things wanted to make an event happen and they vastly underestimated the amount of actual work it takes to make that happen and Simultaneously.

441
00:27:52,414 --> 00:28:02,970
Speaker 1: the core group of people who made this convention happen Were not a stable group of people who are professional and able to trust each other.

442
00:28:03,391 --> 00:28:07,927
Speaker 1: It was people who either didn't know every convention well or was one of those drama friend groups.

443
00:28:08,188 --> 00:28:08,429
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

444
00:28:09,131 --> 00:28:20,111
Speaker 1: And if you ever get involved in the staffing or management of a convention and You go to their meetings and you see that the people involved are drama people quit Immediately.

445
00:28:20,292 --> 00:28:24,470
Speaker 0: never staff for a convention that has drama unless you kick all those people out and you run it.

446
00:28:24,671 --> 00:28:30,353
Speaker 0: Yes, and you're not and you're not those people, but you can't know if you're not those people just like that guy doesn't know He's that guy.

447
00:28:30,513 --> 00:28:30,735
Speaker 1: Yep.

448
00:28:30,956 --> 00:28:32,483
Speaker 1: You know, like other guys are that guy.

449
00:28:32,503 --> 00:28:34,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might.

450
00:28:35,212 --> 00:28:37,159
Speaker 1: Why is it so hard to run a convention but one?

451
00:28:37,801 --> 00:28:39,045
Speaker 1: it's actually not that hard.

452
00:28:39,346 --> 00:28:40,350
Speaker 1: as much as I said, it's hard.

453
00:28:40,450 --> 00:28:41,133
Speaker 1: It's not hard.

454
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:42,638
Speaker 1: It's just hard for most people.

455
00:28:42,959 --> 00:28:45,950
Speaker 1: It's hard if you were unable to act without drama.

456
00:28:46,613 --> 00:28:49,830
Speaker 1: Read and respond to emails immediately.

457
00:28:50,111 --> 00:28:56,777
Speaker 1: Yes, if all of them if someone asks you a question and you can't answer it You need to.

458
00:28:56,917 --> 00:29:04,978
Speaker 1: you have to already know who could answer that question And be able to contact them and that person has to be able to then actually Do what we just said.

459
00:29:04,998 --> 00:29:07,792
Speaker 1: you have to do read emails respond to questions you also.

460
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:15,882
Speaker 0: the main thing is if you're running a whole convention, there's a huge list of things you have to do and You no one's just hands you that list.

461
00:29:16,204 --> 00:29:17,270
Speaker 0: You sort of have to know it.

462
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,558
Speaker 0: Like did you know that you need insurance?

463
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,210
Speaker 0: if you don't know that and you don't buy it you are fucked.

464
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:24,659
Speaker 0: I've been to many but that's a thing.

465
00:29:24,699 --> 00:29:26,369
Speaker 0: No one tells you you need insurance.

466
00:29:26,691 --> 00:29:30,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, you just decide you're gonna run a convention and call a hotel and say hey, I want to have a convention.

467
00:29:30,650 --> 00:29:31,232
Speaker 0: Let's say okay.

468
00:29:31,594 --> 00:29:33,882
Speaker 0: They expect you to just know all these things that you need.

469
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, they think that you're an event manager.

470
00:29:36,331 --> 00:29:37,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have to just know.

471
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:39,640
Speaker 1: and there's another big example.

472
00:29:39,781 --> 00:29:41,004
Speaker 1: I have asked certain conventions.

473
00:29:41,044 --> 00:29:47,170
Speaker 1: We've gone to I'm not gonna name any names But they're large ones and my question was do you pay ASCAP?

474
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:49,996
Speaker 1: Yep, they had no idea.

475
00:29:50,016 --> 00:29:58,450
Speaker 1: and then as a result, I did not ask my follow-up question Which was we're gonna play a bunch of clips of stuff like music in our panel.

476
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,438
Speaker 1: We're assuming that we're covered by that.

477
00:30:01,499 --> 00:30:03,247
Speaker 0: I guess you could also pay BMI.

478
00:30:03,267 --> 00:30:06,796
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, or questions like.

479
00:30:07,097 --> 00:30:10,590
Speaker 1: do you have permission to screen that thing that you're screening in that room?

480
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,350
Speaker 0: Did you know that you needed permission to show this movie to people in this room?

481
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,356
Speaker 0: Is that a thing that you knew you had to have?

482
00:30:16,637 --> 00:30:20,170
Speaker 1: those are professional looking radios that your staff are using?

483
00:30:20,311 --> 00:30:23,710
Speaker 1: Are you licensed to use that kind of radio in this state?

484
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:26,257
Speaker 1: That is a question that needs to be.

485
00:30:26,518 --> 00:30:29,350
Speaker 1: or oh, you've got a nice wireless microphone system.

486
00:30:29,430 --> 00:30:30,554
Speaker 1: What year did you buy that?

487
00:30:31,015 --> 00:30:31,998
Speaker 1: that might be a felony?

488
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:34,767
Speaker 0: Did you rent that from a company?

489
00:30:34,907 --> 00:30:35,770
Speaker 0: Did they have a union?

490
00:30:36,390 --> 00:30:39,000
Speaker 0: Did you know that the unions gonna stop working?

491
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:39,682
Speaker 0: It's such an hour.

492
00:30:39,702 --> 00:30:41,930
Speaker 0: Did you know you want to load things to the loading dock?

493
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,722
Speaker 0: Did you know that you had to pay a union to do that?

494
00:30:43,742 --> 00:30:46,782
Speaker 1: Because it's a union building Do you know what a fire marshal looks like?

495
00:30:46,883 --> 00:30:47,949
Speaker 1: Have you seen him yet?

496
00:30:48,392 --> 00:30:50,967
Speaker 0: Do you know what the fire marshal is going to look for?

497
00:30:50,987 --> 00:30:52,336
Speaker 1: Yes Do you know how to?

498
00:30:52,357 --> 00:30:53,970
Speaker 1: do you know what to say to a fire marshal?

499
00:30:54,290 --> 00:30:57,624
Speaker 0: And these are only the things that we know that you have to check for.

500
00:30:57,704 --> 00:30:59,453
Speaker 0: some of the things that we know you have to Check for.

501
00:30:59,875 --> 00:31:07,770
Speaker 0: there are many other things that you must do that We have not mentioned that you won't know and so if you fuck any of them up you risk fucking everything up.

502
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:15,500
Speaker 0: But really did you know that if you call your the tickets to the convention tickets that many states most in fact have ticket tax That you have to pay.

503
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:21,832
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, if you don't pay the ticket tax you could go to jail Possibly.

504
00:31:21,992 --> 00:31:23,336
Speaker 1: so that is what tax evasion.

505
00:31:23,356 --> 00:31:28,903
Speaker 1: that's why most conventions you go to they sell you a membership into their nonprofit Organization.

506
00:31:29,004 --> 00:31:31,839
Speaker 1: Yes Also, how is your convention run?

507
00:31:31,939 --> 00:31:33,083
Speaker 1: Is there a company involved?

508
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:34,930
Speaker 1: Is there an LLC or a corporation?

509
00:31:36,211 --> 00:31:42,899
Speaker 1: If it's just you and there's no corporation for a sole proprietorship Well, not even we're talking like you.

510
00:31:42,939 --> 00:31:45,348
Speaker 1: just run the convention and do it all yourself.

511
00:31:45,388 --> 00:31:45,990
Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

512
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:49,364
Speaker 1: You're the one who personally gets sued if something happens.

513
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:50,228
Speaker 0: Oh, that's a shame.

514
00:31:50,348 --> 00:31:59,845
Speaker 1: Yeah Also, if you form a nonprofit like a 503c or whatever There's rules about what content you can and cannot have at your event.

515
00:31:59,865 --> 00:32:06,850
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Why do you think so many anime cons have such a bug up their butt about not having content that doesn't fit their charter?

516
00:32:06,931 --> 00:32:15,970
Speaker 1: Well, because a they don't want to have not only made content Also, they have ramifications to going outside of their charter and it's hard to change that charter.

517
00:32:16,331 --> 00:32:24,941
Speaker 1: That's why my advice to you is if you ever run a convention, you should run it from a map from it like an LLC I'm not a lawyer by the way, and you should run it for profit.

518
00:32:25,383 --> 00:32:27,830
Speaker 1: Even if you are in effect a nonprofit.

519
00:32:28,832 --> 00:32:31,045
Speaker 0: All right, so that's pretty much covers all.

520
00:32:31,729 --> 00:32:31,830
Speaker 1: yeah.

521
00:32:32,212 --> 00:32:40,161
Speaker 0: The other thing though is that you look at a failed convention like this, right and when a convention fails I know the people who attend who run it are claiming that it succeeded.

522
00:32:40,241 --> 00:32:41,946
Speaker 1: by the way, whatever because they're already.

523
00:32:41,966 --> 00:32:43,471
Speaker 1: they've announced 2015.

524
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:44,715
Speaker 1: They've announced the venue.

525
00:32:44,775 --> 00:32:48,790
Speaker 0: it's sort of a miracle that even when a convention fails people can still manage to hold another one.

526
00:32:49,192 --> 00:32:55,030
Speaker 1: well, what amazes me is that people go to these things and Don't realize what a disaster it was.

527
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:58,347
Speaker 1: It's like you've never been to another convention and the answer to that appears to be no.

528
00:32:59,071 --> 00:33:03,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of the people who went to dashcon appear to have never been to a convention.

529
00:33:03,290 --> 00:33:04,757
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about conventions.

530
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, then they feel like they can post on the internet like they know everything.

531
00:33:07,723 --> 00:33:12,390
Speaker 1: Yep And we know the staff had not been to a lot of conventions either because one thing I've noticed among nerd cons.

532
00:33:12,754 --> 00:33:14,209
Speaker 1: Is that for good or ill?

533
00:33:14,930 --> 00:33:22,289
Speaker 1: the people who run them The ones that have succeeded and continue to exist like Otakons and katsu kans and mag fests and things like that.

534
00:33:23,153 --> 00:33:27,715
Speaker 1: They went to a lot of nerd cons saw things that were staffed at other cons Yep.

535
00:33:28,352 --> 00:33:35,902
Speaker 1: And then when they run like when they rise to the ranks and start running their own conventions or running bigger events They kind of just do things the way all the other cons do like.

536
00:33:35,942 --> 00:33:37,810
Speaker 1: there's an unspoken rule of like.

537
00:33:38,212 --> 00:33:39,399
Speaker 1: This is just kind of how you do.

538
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:40,404
Speaker 0: but you learn.

539
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:44,190
Speaker 0: working at one convention You take the things you learn and just repeat them at the other one.

540
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,844
Speaker 1: You know like submit a panel to pretty much any nerd con even like New York Comic Con.

541
00:33:48,964 --> 00:33:54,118
Speaker 1: It's all pretty much the same process Submit a panel to dashcon.

542
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:57,010
Speaker 1: Well, we talked about that at length on geek nights.

543
00:33:58,271 --> 00:34:07,455
Speaker 1: It's like the people who wrote this policy had literally never heard of a convention and came up with like their idea of how Should go out of convention.

544
00:34:08,197 --> 00:34:09,703
Speaker 1: quote as a panelist.

545
00:34:09,864 --> 00:34:11,610
Speaker 1: You'll be expected to think on your feet at that quickly.

546
00:34:13,014 --> 00:34:17,389
Speaker 1: You will be expected to attend all required briefing sessions.

547
00:34:17,851 --> 00:34:24,570
Speaker 1: Well, you might be needed briefing for along with one in-person briefing session held just before the actual start of the convention.

548
00:34:26,152 --> 00:34:29,449
Speaker 1: You'll expected to attend all the panels to which you are assigned.

549
00:34:30,252 --> 00:34:35,310
Speaker 1: The assigned Sun will be expected to act in a way that does not upset our guests or trying to the convention name.

550
00:34:35,632 --> 00:34:38,248
Speaker 1: You'll respect the authority of the Dashcon staff.

551
00:34:39,889 --> 00:34:47,449
Speaker 1: Oh, so long as you do not feel the direction of the staff endangers the mental, physical, emotional well-being of you, you'll be expected to understand that panel...

552
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,170
Speaker 0: That was written by people who were on top of Tumblr.

553
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:49,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's for sure.

554
00:34:50,453 --> 00:34:50,646
Speaker 0: Anyway.

555
00:34:51,351 --> 00:34:52,770
Speaker 1: Oh my god, this just keeps going.

556
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,510
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

557
00:34:53,692 --> 00:35:07,889
Speaker 1: This thing's like 100... Basically, you would... They formed these committees of people for different types of content, and then those people, who were vetted by this ridiculous process, would then put together these panels, and then you only got reimbursed.

558
00:35:08,571 --> 00:35:11,050
Speaker 1: If you ran a panel, you still had to pay for your badge.

559
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:19,989
Speaker 1: You got the badge for the day of the panel that you ran refunded to you if 100 people attended the panel.

560
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:20,373
Speaker 1: Whoa.

561
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:21,950
Speaker 1: Yeah.

562
00:35:22,657 --> 00:35:22,930
Speaker 0: Nope.

563
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:23,274
Speaker 0: Yeah.

564
00:35:24,871 --> 00:35:26,689
Speaker 0: People just coming up with stuff that sounds good.

565
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:28,450
Speaker 1: Well, it doesn't even sound good.

566
00:35:29,052 --> 00:35:29,928
Speaker 0: Well, it sounds good to them.

567
00:35:30,358 --> 00:35:30,910
Speaker 0: Knowing nothing.

568
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:33,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, this forum wants my birthday.

569
00:35:34,891 --> 00:35:40,889
Speaker 1: The forum to submit a panel to this is longer than any forum I've ever submitted to any convention in my entire life.

570
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,790
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is, when a convention fails...

571
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:45,050
Speaker 1: Have you ever been convicted of a felony?

572
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:45,727
Speaker 1: No.

573
00:35:45,951 --> 00:35:46,890
Speaker 1: If so, please explain.

574
00:35:47,931 --> 00:35:51,790
Speaker 0: When a convention fails like this, there's mega collateral damage.

575
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:58,949
Speaker 0: That one person sucking at running conventions hurts all these other people, the attendees, the guests, pretty much anyone involved gets hurt.

576
00:35:59,291 --> 00:36:07,950
Speaker 0: Some people traveled a long way, took vacation days, bought, spent money, and went to a thing and had a subpar experience and waste all the time.

577
00:36:08,090 --> 00:36:16,310
Speaker 0: They have a right to be upset and they are, yeah, they should be upset at the people who sold them a raw egg, but they should be slightly upset at themselves.

578
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:21,709
Speaker 0: I know that's victim blaming, but you should be able to tell that convention is shitty and not go to it.

579
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:23,069
Speaker 1: I buy raw eggs all the time.

580
00:36:23,477 --> 00:36:23,710
Speaker 0: Right.

581
00:36:24,411 --> 00:36:26,390
Speaker 0: And it's your fault if you get poisoned.

582
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:28,708
Speaker 1: Raw eggs are just an egg.

583
00:36:29,711 --> 00:36:32,770
Speaker 1: If I bought an egg, why would I expect it to not be raw?

584
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,030
Speaker 1: I wouldn't buy an egg that was pre-cooked.

585
00:36:34,250 --> 00:36:36,139
Speaker 0: I drank raw milk and I died, come on.

586
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:44,950
Speaker 0: But it's really not any different from all the other things people fail at, nerds and not nerds.

587
00:36:45,070 --> 00:36:48,530
Speaker 0: People try to do things they don't know how to do all the time, self-included, right?

588
00:36:48,991 --> 00:36:54,750
Speaker 0: How many people like, I don't know, try to write a video game and they don't know how to code and it just fails completely?

589
00:36:55,190 --> 00:36:55,278
Speaker 1: Yeah.

590
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,210
Speaker 1: How many people try to do a podcast?

591
00:36:58,293 --> 00:36:58,399
Speaker 1: Yes.

592
00:36:59,210 --> 00:36:59,930
Speaker 0: And it fails completely.

593
00:37:00,733 --> 00:37:00,824
Speaker 0: Yeah.

594
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:04,810
Speaker 0: The only difference is when people do those things, it doesn't make the news because no one else suffers.

595
00:37:05,250 --> 00:37:05,709
Speaker 0: If you listen.

596
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:07,510
Speaker 0: Maybe the person who did it doesn't even suffer.

597
00:37:07,630 --> 00:37:13,309
Speaker 1: If you listen to those early episodes, the geek nights, like the beta episodes, the only person who was harmed by those was you.

598
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:13,907
Speaker 0: Right.

599
00:37:14,716 --> 00:37:15,750
Speaker 0: And you can just stop listening.

600
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:23,410
Speaker 0: It's not like you traveled and took out a hotel, used vacation days and bought tickets to geek nights and then it sucked.

601
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:28,463
Speaker 0: It's like you turned it on, it sucked and you turned it off two seconds later and that's life.

602
00:37:28,715 --> 00:37:28,850
Speaker 0: Right.

603
00:37:28,850 --> 00:37:29,568
Speaker 0: It's not a big deal.

604
00:37:30,151 --> 00:37:36,529
Speaker 0: You know, so it's like when a convention fails, it makes the news, but it's really not any different from anyone failing at any other sort of thing.

605
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,048
Speaker 1: Yup.

606
00:37:37,650 --> 00:37:47,209
Speaker 0: But you know, if you, if you look at why these people fail to this convention, look at any of the things you fail at in your life and it's the same thing that happened to you when you tried to do something and sucked.

607
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:59,706
Speaker 1: Though with the convention, I think what really happened here with Dashcon was that the people involved were young, inexperienced, naive, and there was obviously drama because, uh, I'll link to this.

608
00:38:00,710 --> 00:38:12,730
Speaker 1: Dashcon put out a couple of different versions of this and they seem to have like tried to remove bits over time, but they have this like giant explanation of separating fact from fiction and official statement.

609
00:38:13,613 --> 00:38:14,624
Speaker 1: I read this whole thing.

610
00:38:15,912 --> 00:38:24,609
Speaker 1: It, to summarize it, we're all fuckups and this is our attempt to try to make ourselves look a little less like fuckups.

611
00:38:24,790 --> 00:38:25,409
Speaker 0: We know how to write.

612
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:26,365
Speaker 1: We are.

613
00:38:26,790 --> 00:38:35,869
Speaker 1: This is, we don't know how to run a convention, but we know how to write like the five year old that you find in his bedroom with the pie that he stole from the kitchen, like smashed all over his bed.

614
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,541
Speaker 1: And he's trying to explain to you the series of events.

615
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:41,350
Speaker 1: I can explain this and how it was not his fault.

616
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,930
Speaker 0: It's really smooth talker, but that pie is still all over the place.

617
00:38:45,051 --> 00:38:46,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, like I'm looking at the pie.

618
00:38:46,530 --> 00:38:48,929
Speaker 1: He's like, well, there might've been a pie.

619
00:38:50,710 --> 00:38:52,550
Speaker 1: Someone else was responsible for the pie.

620
00:38:53,312 --> 00:38:55,369
Speaker 1: I'm just responsible for the room the pie ended up in.

621
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:58,570
Speaker 0: Let's talk about some other failed conventions from history.

622
00:38:59,110 --> 00:38:59,529
Speaker 1: From history?

623
00:38:59,693 --> 00:38:59,784
Speaker 0: Yeah.

624
00:38:59,890 --> 00:39:02,049
Speaker 0: What, what, what failed conventions can we think of?

625
00:39:03,011 --> 00:39:08,250
Speaker 1: You know, the only convention I've been to that I would consider a failure was Setacon.

626
00:39:08,738 --> 00:39:08,926
Speaker 0: Yeah.

627
00:39:10,010 --> 00:39:20,950
Speaker 1: Because as a person who uses the internet, I saw Dashcon as a disaster coming from the day it was announced that they were accepting panel submissions.

628
00:39:21,010 --> 00:39:25,950
Speaker 0: I didn't even know it was a thing until I read the stories about it failing and I was like, oh, I guess this thing happened.

629
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:29,010
Speaker 1: They emailed me asking if we were going to be at Dashcon.

630
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:32,189
Speaker 1: I thought, I assumed it was some My Little Pony thing.

631
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:33,469
Speaker 1: So I was like, yeah, no.

632
00:39:33,870 --> 00:39:34,310
Speaker 0: Oh, cause Rainbow Dash.

633
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:34,683
Speaker 1: Yeah.

634
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:36,130
Speaker 1: I was like, no, we're not going to that.

635
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,388
Speaker 1: I didn't even like look up what it was.

636
00:39:38,210 --> 00:39:43,969
Speaker 1: And then like Mike Tool, I think tweeted something about like, oh my God, look at this Dashcon panel submission thing.

637
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:46,210
Speaker 1: I clicked on this expecting to make fun of some cronies.

638
00:39:46,330 --> 00:39:47,890
Speaker 0: So you knew about it before the convention happened.

639
00:39:48,991 --> 00:39:52,510
Speaker 1: The best reading this page, which I'll also link to the page on panel submissions.

640
00:39:53,811 --> 00:40:05,709
Speaker 1: If you as a human being read this page and do not see that this convention is going to be a disaster from that point, you're the kind of person who's going to get scammed into buying a stereo from a guy in a white van.

641
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:14,710
Speaker 1: Dashcon was a guy selling you a really expensive stereo system for way cheap out of the back of a white van in like the parking lot of a Sears.

642
00:40:15,352 --> 00:40:17,790
Speaker 1: I have almost no sympathy for the people who attended this convention.

643
00:40:19,291 --> 00:40:24,240
Speaker 1: So as a result, I have not experienced convention failures because I see them coming and avoid them.

644
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:26,627
Speaker 1: Cinecon, we were paid to go to.

645
00:40:27,651 --> 00:40:28,145
Speaker 1: And you know what?

646
00:40:29,051 --> 00:40:33,849
Speaker 1: They didn't fuck up even close to the degree of Dashcon because we got our hotel room.

647
00:40:34,561 --> 00:40:35,810
Speaker 1: We got everything was compensated.

648
00:40:36,551 --> 00:40:37,650
Speaker 0: All that stuff worked.

649
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:38,570
Speaker 0: All the events happened?

650
00:40:38,930 --> 00:40:38,999
Speaker 0: Yes.

651
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:40,930
Speaker 1: The geek nights meet and greet.

652
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:42,688
Speaker 1: We showed up to run it.

653
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:43,730
Speaker 1: Everything was fine.

654
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:44,425
Speaker 1: The room was there.

655
00:40:44,970 --> 00:40:45,707
Speaker 1: Microphones were there.

656
00:40:46,532 --> 00:40:47,089
Speaker 1: No attendees.

657
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,949
Speaker 0: Wasn't there one attendee?

658
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:50,548
Speaker 1: One attendee.

659
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,148
Speaker 1: It was one of our fellow guests who came in to see what was up because no one was at their panel.

660
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:57,790
Speaker 1: And then the three of us left the room and went to the fast karate room.

661
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,827
Speaker 1: We're like, "Hey, what are you guys up

662
00:40:58,868 --> 00:40:58,909
Speaker 1: to?".

663
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,329
Speaker 1: And they're like hanging out in this empty panel room.

664
00:41:02,051 --> 00:41:06,150
Speaker 1: And then we eventually all converged on the Happy House of Hentai meet and greet panel.

665
00:41:06,452 --> 00:41:07,449
Speaker 0: That actually had people at it.

666
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,390
Speaker 1: Yes, all of us and a few other people.

667
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:10,047
Speaker 1: And then we hung out.

668
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:15,350
Speaker 0: But yeah, just no attendance caused the not so success of that convention.

669
00:41:15,670 --> 00:41:18,950
Speaker 1: We pretty much sat in the room that was like the guest's room.

670
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,230
Speaker 1: Like imagine the hall where all the guests sit at their table and you get autographs.

671
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:26,590
Speaker 1: So all of us who were paid to be there just kind of sat in that room hanging out.

672
00:41:27,571 --> 00:41:30,629
Speaker 1: No one came in at any point who wasn't one of us.

673
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:35,150
Speaker 1: I walked over to the dealer's room and there were like 10 or 15 people walking around.

674
00:41:36,591 --> 00:41:41,428
Speaker 1: There were people who went to the cosplay thing at the end, but that was a disaster because they asked us to judge it.

675
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:43,330
Speaker 0: I don't know anything about judging cosplay.

676
00:41:43,652 --> 00:41:44,649
Speaker 0: I judge the one that looked best.

677
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:50,789
Speaker 1: I was looking at people stitching and I was like, "I don't know, four out of five stitchings?

678
00:41:51,692 --> 00:41:52,369
Speaker 1: Sorry, kid.

679
00:41:53,030 --> 00:41:54,690
Speaker 1: I don't know if you bought this from a store.

680
00:41:55,154 --> 00:41:56,648
Speaker 1: I don't even know what character this is.

681
00:41:57,570 --> 00:42:00,730
Speaker 1: I don't understand enough about costuming to look at your reference material.

682
00:42:01,050 --> 00:42:02,949
Speaker 0: That one definitely looks better than the other one to me.

683
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,269
Speaker 0: If it was on the internet and it was hot or not, I would pick that one.

684
00:42:08,413 --> 00:42:10,290
Speaker 1: There was that first New York Comic-Con.

685
00:42:11,711 --> 00:42:13,425
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, they failed because they sold out.

686
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,809
Speaker 0: They had people showed up who couldn't get in.

687
00:42:16,110 --> 00:42:19,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was a professional event and they fucked it up big time.

688
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:27,250
Speaker 1: I mean, when guests can't get in to run their own panels because the fire marshal has shut you the fuck down, that's it though.

689
00:42:27,390 --> 00:42:29,110
Speaker 1: I haven't really run afoul a lot of these conventions.

690
00:42:29,310 --> 00:42:32,630
Speaker 1: I mean, I've heard a lot of tell of smallish gaming cons.

691
00:42:32,810 --> 00:42:34,049
Speaker 0: How many Rude-A-Cons failed?

692
00:42:35,276 --> 00:42:36,010
Speaker 0: Did they even count?

693
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,449
Speaker 0: Did it even technically happen?

694
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:43,030
Speaker 1: So actually, that's a good example because that was the first convention I ever staffed.

695
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:53,050
Speaker 1: I was asked, well, tricked by hook and crook, I joined the staff and I became the webmaster for this convention.

696
00:42:54,192 --> 00:43:07,589
Speaker 1: And then I went to the first meeting and the meeting was about how we as a convention are going to apologize to the vendors from the previous year for straight embezzling their money and thanking them for not involving the police.

697
00:43:09,157 --> 00:43:12,510
Speaker 0: And I was like- How could you embezzle- Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.

698
00:43:12,610 --> 00:43:14,750
Speaker 0: How could you possibly embezzle a vendor's money?

699
00:43:15,171 --> 00:43:15,567
Speaker 1: Openly.

700
00:43:15,971 --> 00:43:21,950
Speaker 0: So what they did- The vendors give you money for the space, they come in and they sell things and collect money for themselves.

701
00:43:22,070 --> 00:43:27,148
Speaker 1: So there was a currency at the convention called, I think, Rude-A-Box, and you could win them at events.

702
00:43:28,090 --> 00:43:30,249
Speaker 1: They counted as dollars in the dealer's room.

703
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:34,550
Speaker 1: The dealers would then get cash from the convention after it was done.

704
00:43:34,570 --> 00:43:35,730
Speaker 0: They just didn't give them the cash for the Rude-A-Box?

705
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:36,327
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

706
00:43:37,094 --> 00:43:37,263
Speaker 0: Okay.

707
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:38,629
Speaker 1: There were a lot of Rude-A-Bucks.

708
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:40,966
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

709
00:43:41,230 --> 00:43:42,129
Speaker 0: They just handed them out like candy?

710
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,110
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

711
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:44,829
Speaker 1: That was before we were even at RIT.

712
00:43:45,751 --> 00:43:47,864
Speaker 0: If I was a vendor, I'd be like, "Fuck your

713
00:43:47,884 --> 00:43:48,387
Speaker 0: Rude-A-Bucks.".

714
00:43:50,272 --> 00:43:52,425
Speaker 0: They're basically the- "You're Jackson's face on that

715
00:43:52,486 --> 00:43:52,689
Speaker 0: shit?".

716
00:43:53,230 --> 00:43:53,272
Speaker 0: "No.".

717
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:54,725
Speaker 0: "Eh, you ain't getting nothing from

718
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:54,888
Speaker 0: me.".

719
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:57,009
Speaker 1: It's that currency in itchy and scratchy land.

720
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:57,530
Speaker 0: Yeah.

721
00:43:58,490 --> 00:43:58,581
Speaker 0: Bits.

722
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:00,901
Speaker 0: Dogecoin.

723
00:44:01,850 --> 00:44:02,809
Speaker 0: Not taking your dogecoin.

724
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:04,444
Speaker 1: But basically, seriously.

725
00:44:05,971 --> 00:44:08,929
Speaker 1: When it comes to- I feel like we could do a separate- I don't want to do a Geek Nights on this.

726
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:13,090
Speaker 1: I almost want to do a separate YouTube series of every area of a convention.

727
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:17,990
Speaker 1: Dude, if you're seriously going to run it, here's the playbook on how to run this shit.

728
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:30,230
Speaker 1: Because if you read this Dashcon thing, most of their excuses come down to, "Well, Jenny McShavidoo was responsible for that, and she didn't respond to an email, so I wasn't able.

729
00:44:30,330 --> 00:44:33,969
Speaker 0: The first thing we said about running a successful convention, reading and responding to emails immediately.

730
00:44:34,194 --> 00:44:34,348
Speaker 1: Yeah.

731
00:44:34,650 --> 00:44:39,829
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just nothing but passing the bucks around, because these kids had no idea what they were doing.

732
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,190
Speaker 1: And it's really just summed up by that ball pit.

733
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:44,290
Speaker 0: Buck stops here.

734
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:45,090
Speaker 0: Who is the con chair?

735
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:46,288
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

736
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,790
Speaker 0: But it appears- You read the con chair, and you email someone.

737
00:44:48,890 --> 00:44:49,610
Speaker 0: They don't email you back.

738
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:50,107
Speaker 0: It's on you.

739
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:50,519
Speaker 1: Yeah.

740
00:44:50,850 --> 00:44:51,390
Speaker 1: I mean, that's it.

741
00:44:51,610 --> 00:45:08,729
Speaker 1: In the old days, before we got Kristen and other people to help us, if something went wrong, I had a panelist come up to me, and they were like, "We were promised a hotel room, and we don't have one, and we need somewhere to sleep tonight, and there was no one I could go to above me to deal with that.

742
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:13,488
Speaker 1: That was my responsibility to figure out what the fuck happened there, and I had to deal with it.

743
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:13,989
Speaker 1: And you know what?

744
00:45:14,091 --> 00:45:14,747
Speaker 1: I dealt with it.

745
00:45:15,460 --> 00:45:17,570
Speaker 1: People at Dashcon didn't deal with it.

746
00:45:18,151 --> 00:45:20,910
Speaker 1: They just kind of let it all slowly collapse around themselves.

747
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:29,330
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

748
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:34,450
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando Kay for the logos.

749

Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
