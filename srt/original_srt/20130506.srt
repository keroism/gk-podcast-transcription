1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,427
Speaker 0: It's Monday, May 6th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,427 --> 00:00:12,751
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,971 --> 00:00:13,533
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,573 --> 00:00:14,756
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,817 --> 00:00:19,083
Speaker 0: Tonight, what to do with your bits when your meat stops working.

6
00:00:21,365 --> 00:00:22,466
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:35,860
Speaker 0: So I won't belabor the point, but many of you noticed on Twitter, in recent memory, I was arguing a bit with Ask.com because they stupidly responded to my tweet.

8
00:00:36,442 --> 00:00:37,044
Speaker 1: Really?

9
00:00:37,165 --> 00:00:40,115
Speaker 1: Usually that kind of place is not going to respond to an aggressive tweet.

10
00:00:40,517 --> 00:00:41,681
Speaker 0: I never understand.

11
00:00:41,701 --> 00:00:44,230
Speaker 0: It's like, well, the thing is, do not engage.

12
00:00:44,511 --> 00:00:45,856
Speaker 1: Usually they do not engage.

13
00:00:46,217 --> 00:00:48,988
Speaker 0: It's telling that Oracle did not engage at all.

14
00:00:49,008 --> 00:00:51,135
Speaker 1: I don't think Oracle engages with anybody.

15
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:53,521
Speaker 0: Because Oracle does actually know better.

16
00:00:53,902 --> 00:01:03,533
Speaker 0: But Ask.com engaged, especially Ask.com Eric, and then magically they suddenly stopped engaging once the retweets started happening.

17
00:01:04,194 --> 00:01:10,358
Speaker 0: So the funny thing at the very end of that, I guess they saw the Streisand effect coming in the headlights.

18
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:17,345
Speaker 0: Well, I kind of gave them a hint in my Tumblr where I was basically like, if you're Ask.com, don't engage people like me.

19
00:01:17,405 --> 00:01:20,074
Speaker 0: My job is to catch you saying something stupid in public.

20
00:01:21,418 --> 00:01:31,289
Speaker 0: But really the reason I bring it up now is that I am actually mad about the fact that semi-legitimate software like Java has bundled shitware in it.

21
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, usually that's the realm of shit software, right?

22
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:36,553
Speaker 1: It's like some guy makes a piece of shit program.

23
00:01:36,975 --> 00:01:41,253
Speaker 1: You know, he includes some, you know, auto install nonsense in the installer to make money.

24
00:01:41,273 --> 00:01:45,249
Speaker 1: That's the kind of thing that shady crapware does not super pro real.

25
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:46,536
Speaker 1: So you don't see Adobe doing that.

26
00:01:46,617 --> 00:01:49,511
Speaker 1: Oh, wait, you do McAfee when trying to install a flash plugin.

27
00:01:49,852 --> 00:01:50,474
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

28
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:51,016
Speaker 1: Right.

29
00:01:51,357 --> 00:01:54,988
Speaker 1: But you know, usually real software does not do that.

30
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,673
Speaker 1: It's a low life thing to do.

31
00:01:58,218 --> 00:02:04,098
Speaker 0: So I don't know what to do about it because Java, I mean, unless Oracle drops it, it actually causes problems.

32
00:02:04,359 --> 00:02:11,565
Speaker 0: Pretty much everyone who has a company that makes Java using software and it's not easy to just rewrite everything in another language.

33
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:15,725
Speaker 0: So I'm just mad about that lately and I'm not going to let it go.

34
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:16,570
Speaker 0: That's all I got there.

35
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:17,896
Speaker 0: That's my opening bit.

36
00:02:18,017 --> 00:02:22,077
Speaker 1: Well, I actually, because of this, I learned about this really interesting thing I didn't know about before.

37
00:02:22,218 --> 00:02:22,580
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

38
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,001
Speaker 1: You sent me a link about this called Ninite or nine night N I N I T E right.

39
00:02:27,061 --> 00:02:29,812
Speaker 1: And what this thing is, I think I'm going to start using this.

40
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,119
Speaker 1: Um, it's malware.

41
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:32,720
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

42
00:02:33,142 --> 00:02:34,044
Speaker 1: I verified this.

43
00:02:34,064 --> 00:02:35,288
Speaker 0: How'd you verify it?

44
00:02:35,749 --> 00:02:39,322
Speaker 1: I went and asked around and I went to, did you ask people?

45
00:02:39,342 --> 00:02:39,624
Speaker 1: I know.

46
00:02:39,644 --> 00:02:39,724
Speaker 1: Okay.

47
00:02:40,366 --> 00:02:44,019
Speaker 0: Just cause a lot of people we know install a lot of wares.

48
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,010
Speaker 1: I also checked around the internet in multiple places.

49
00:02:47,432 --> 00:02:51,467
Speaker 1: that are the kind of places that verify malwares and can be trusted, right?

50
00:02:51,548 --> 00:02:53,053
Speaker 1: Including like security websites.

51
00:02:53,294 --> 00:02:53,796
Speaker 0: All right.

52
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:55,522
Speaker 1: And yeah, there's a lot of like.

53
00:02:55,582 --> 00:03:04,776
Speaker 1: NASA uses it like legit NASA or NASA and it's not just because it says on the front page that NASA, Harvard and Tupperware all use this.

54
00:03:05,137 --> 00:03:08,549
Speaker 1: I actually went and checked to see if NASA actually used it and they do.

55
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:09,172
Speaker 1: All right.

56
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:14,236
Speaker 1: So the way this thing works is you go to this website and there's a bunch of check boxes, right?

57
00:03:14,597 --> 00:03:20,824
Speaker 1: And this check boxes, I realized looking through it for pretty much every app that I would install on a windows computer.

58
00:03:20,845 --> 00:03:22,291
Speaker 1: Here's the ones that I would pick up.

59
00:03:22,311 --> 00:03:25,521
Speaker 1: Chrome, Firefox, steam, Google earth, maybe.

60
00:03:25,802 --> 00:03:28,491
Speaker 0: Um, you know, I always install Google earth.

61
00:03:28,953 --> 00:03:31,822
Speaker 0: I haven't actually used it in like three years.

62
00:03:32,043 --> 00:03:34,672
Speaker 1: Skype, maybe Google talk or pigeon or whatever.

63
00:03:34,852 --> 00:03:36,156
Speaker 1: All the IM clients are on there.

64
00:03:36,718 --> 00:03:40,890
Speaker 1: iTunes, VLC, maybe Hulu, Winamp, maybe right.

65
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:41,813
Speaker 1: Spotify maybe.

66
00:03:41,993 --> 00:03:42,174
Speaker 1: All right.

67
00:03:42,194 --> 00:03:49,719
Speaker 0: So it's basically like a repo, but for windows, Java, uh, Adobe air shockwave, silver light flash, right?

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,906
Speaker 1: Um, pretty much everything.

69
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:53,170
Speaker 1: VNC client launchy.

70
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:55,156
Speaker 1: I use launchy seven.

71
00:03:55,196 --> 00:03:56,440
Speaker 0: I don't use launchy anymore.

72
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:00,434
Speaker 0: I used to win RAR because windows just kind of does that now.

73
00:04:01,859 --> 00:04:05,393
Speaker 1: The window, the thing in the start menu when you push the window key is not that good.

74
00:04:05,413 --> 00:04:10,013
Speaker 0: I've never started typing something and not had it immediately give me what I wanted.

75
00:04:10,274 --> 00:04:12,927
Speaker 1: The thing is I have launchy configured to do one thing.

76
00:04:12,947 --> 00:04:19,798
Speaker 1: It's just, I have in my home because you know how sometimes you get applications that you double click set up that exe and they install properly, right?

77
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:20,402
Speaker 0: Yeah.

78
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:23,757
Speaker 1: And they go into program files and they create start menu icons.

79
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:24,098
Speaker 0: Yup.

80
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,390
Speaker 1: And the window key works great for that, right?

81
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:27,735
Speaker 0: Window key works for bullshit.

82
00:04:27,816 --> 00:04:30,990
Speaker 0: I dragged putty onto my desktop and it shows up in there really.

83
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:31,452
Speaker 0: Yeah.

84
00:04:31,954 --> 00:04:40,508
Speaker 1: But what happens to me is I'll take something like door fortress, which is an unzip and I'll put it inside, you know, users me applications, a folder I made.

85
00:04:41,049 --> 00:04:45,309
Speaker 1: If it's an unzip type application, I put it in there and window key hasn't been finding those.

86
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:47,946
Speaker 1: and I don't really want to go through the effort of making a start menu shortcut.

87
00:04:47,987 --> 00:04:53,230
Speaker 0: I think there's a way to configure it because window key finds bullshit that I drop in like my home direct.

88
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:53,531
Speaker 1: Okay.

89
00:04:53,691 --> 00:04:56,341
Speaker 1: Also, I really like the keyboard shortcut.

90
00:04:56,441 --> 00:04:57,947
Speaker 1: Alt space as opposed to window key.

91
00:04:58,328 --> 00:04:59,252
Speaker 0: Ah, true, true.

92
00:04:59,392 --> 00:05:00,759
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's a minor whatever.

93
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:01,241
Speaker 1: Yeah.

94
00:05:01,402 --> 00:05:02,969
Speaker 1: Putty is actually something that's on here.

95
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:10,919
Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, basically you go to this website, you check the check boxes for all the apps you want to install and you click get installer.

96
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,708
Speaker 1: Then it'll give you an exe, right?

97
00:05:14,069 --> 00:05:16,984
Speaker 1: And you run that and it will install all the apps you chose.

98
00:05:17,386 --> 00:05:25,161
Speaker 1: So you don't have to go around the internet like finding all the windows apps that you normally get and you know, collecting all these things except I guess Nvidia drivers not on here.

99
00:05:25,181 --> 00:05:33,835
Speaker 1: Uh, but other than that, right, you just go to this one place, get one installer for all your apps and run it and your windows boxes set up so fast.

100
00:05:34,177 --> 00:05:35,703
Speaker 1: This is even has useful stuff.

101
00:05:35,743 --> 00:05:39,600
Speaker 1: You get the pro version for like assisted men administering a whole bunch of windows machines.

102
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:47,130
Speaker 1: You can like, you know, set all the windows machines to like, okay, everybody upgrade when amp everybody install open office.

103
00:05:47,391 --> 00:05:49,160
Speaker 1: You can do star Libra office now, right?

104
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,526
Speaker 1: You can do stuff like that with this thing.

105
00:05:51,149 --> 00:06:04,570
Speaker 1: So this allows you to install a Java without an ask toolbar, the sun Java and people were, I think Adobe I think was going after night for cause it was skipping the McAfee, whatever

106
00:06:05,213 --> 00:06:08,627
Speaker 0: the fact that Adobe went after, it seems to be how most people learn that exists.

107
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:13,485
Speaker 1: It was a Streisand effect for me for sure, but um, this thing is totally awesome.

108
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:14,168
Speaker 0: Yeah.

109
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:16,481
Speaker 1: I'm going to use this the next time I have a windows box.

110
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,527
Speaker 1: I need to set it from scratch,

111
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:27,714
Speaker 0: but it's interesting because years ago I would have said that the biggest problem normal people have with their computers, especially laptops, is all the shit where that OEMs bundle and then Microsoft kind

112
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:31,895
Speaker 1: of allows them to, I'm telling you if Microsoft, right, here's the thing with windows.

113
00:06:31,915 --> 00:06:35,233
Speaker 0: Well, I was about to say it doesn't matter anymore because people don't use computers.

114
00:06:35,273 --> 00:06:40,875
Speaker 1: They use already too late, but windows got a bad rap with a lot of people in the world, right?

115
00:06:41,157 --> 00:06:45,414
Speaker 1: Because of all these perceived problems with it, especially windows Vista and such, right?

116
00:06:45,936 --> 00:06:59,165
Speaker 1: If windows would have put a Microsoft would have put their fist down their foot down and said, if you install anything on a computer that is pre-installed with windows besides windows, you do not get a discount from us.

117
00:06:59,206 --> 00:07:01,855
Speaker 1: You have to pay full retail price for every copy of windows.

118
00:07:02,317 --> 00:07:09,930
Speaker 1: Every single OEM, like Dell and everybody, it was the least bad and they still bundle a bunch of shit, but at least you can uninstall it properly.

119
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:10,512
Speaker 1: Right?

120
00:07:10,993 --> 00:07:14,608
Speaker 1: Every single one of those people would have stopped immediately, right?

121
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:16,717
Speaker 1: Or they would have fought first, but they would lost.

122
00:07:17,239 --> 00:07:23,025
Speaker 1: They would have stopped installing garbage, like replacing the windows, wifi with a bullshit wifi manager.

123
00:07:23,366 --> 00:07:25,334
Speaker 1: All that shit would have gone away, right?

124
00:07:25,475 --> 00:07:26,198
Speaker 1: Except drivers.

125
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:30,394
Speaker 0: I just still don't understand how the ecosystem got to the point where that worked.

126
00:07:30,454 --> 00:07:37,007
Speaker 1: I mean, windows would have had a much better reception among people because using it would have been much more of a pleasure.

127
00:07:37,027 --> 00:07:39,299
Speaker 1: It would have been the intended experience and not this fucked up.

128
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:42,795
Speaker 1: Oh, my computer's broken because the person who sold your computer broke it.

129
00:07:42,815 --> 00:07:44,100
Speaker 1: It's not Microsoft.

130
00:07:44,321 --> 00:07:47,694
Speaker 0: Who like, how is, where did the money actually come from?

131
00:07:47,734 --> 00:07:51,550
Speaker 0: So maybe McAfee pays like Lenovo to include it in their bullshit.

132
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:51,931
Speaker 1: Right?

133
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:56,248
Speaker 0: I can understand those cases, but then how does McAfee make that money back?

134
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:58,276
Speaker 1: Who is paying right?

135
00:07:58,296 --> 00:08:02,472
Speaker 1: I understand that like McAfee will pay Lenovo to include like antivirus free trial.

136
00:08:02,512 --> 00:08:03,174
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

137
00:08:04,117 --> 00:08:08,028
Speaker 1: Who pays Lenovo to include Lenovo wifi manager?

138
00:08:08,048 --> 00:08:12,586
Speaker 0: I think they do it on their own for a better user experience, but it's, it ruins it.

139
00:08:12,606 --> 00:08:15,477
Speaker 1: The built in windows wifi manager is amazing and great.

140
00:08:15,779 --> 00:08:17,024
Speaker 1: It works perfectly fine.

141
00:08:17,325 --> 00:08:21,460
Speaker 1: Why would you cover it up with this Lenovo one that sucks and is ugly.

142
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:24,672
Speaker 1: And at the same time, everyone gets really confused.

143
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,740
Speaker 1: Cause now there's two wifi managers.

144
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,747
Speaker 0: You're only ruining it.

145
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:33,528
Speaker 0: I think what I find the most amusing is that Lenovo and other people always do this kind of ineptly.

146
00:08:33,828 --> 00:08:39,068
Speaker 0: They'll add things to the task bar and they try to make them look like a battery manager.

147
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,258
Speaker 0: Now, but the thing is the battery manager, like.

148
00:08:41,479 --> 00:08:45,878
Speaker 0: obviously it's just slightly the wrong color and just like kind of the wrong bezel.

149
00:08:45,958 --> 00:08:47,825
Speaker 0: And it's obvious that it shouldn't be there.

150
00:08:48,969 --> 00:08:59,014
Speaker 0: Though at least to us, to normal people, they have no fucking battery manager does include some things you can't do with the windows one involving actually controlling some deep parameters in the battery, right?

151
00:08:59,054 --> 00:09:01,487
Speaker 1: You should be doing that in a driver, right?

152
00:09:01,527 --> 00:09:02,110
Speaker 1: For the battery.

153
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:07,868
Speaker 1: That handles the battery properly without changing the user interface, right?

154
00:09:08,068 --> 00:09:08,570
Speaker 1: Whatsoever.

155
00:09:08,811 --> 00:09:12,166
Speaker 1: And windows actually includes facilities to do things like that properly.

156
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:21,443
Speaker 1: Like in video, when you go to video properties, right inside your video properties, there's like a thing for the video driver to go to the Nvidia control panel.

157
00:09:21,484 --> 00:09:24,557
Speaker 1: It's done correctly, even though it's this extra thing, right?

158
00:09:24,838 --> 00:09:27,068
Speaker 1: It's still done properly in the windows way.

159
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:34,536
Speaker 1: It's not some like ugly hack where to change resolution, you can't use the windows change resolution thing anymore, right?

160
00:09:34,597 --> 00:09:42,229
Speaker 1: It's like, no, they put the extra Nvidia controls in the Nvidia area in a special tab and all the windows stuff is still the windows stuff.

161
00:09:42,269 --> 00:09:43,152
Speaker 1: It's done correctly.

162
00:09:43,172 --> 00:09:44,498
Speaker 1: Got to do with that.

163
00:09:44,558 --> 00:09:47,088
Speaker 1: You know, anyway, the no one would complain.

164
00:09:47,169 --> 00:09:50,866
Speaker 1: I wouldn't complain if I bought a laptop that had the Nvidia driver preinstalled.

165
00:09:50,927 --> 00:09:52,554
Speaker 0: I think the moral is pretty simple.

166
00:09:52,995 --> 00:09:54,401
Speaker 0: Don't tolerate bullshit.

167
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:59,000
Speaker 0: bundle where and whenever a semi legitimate company includes it, call them out on it.

168
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,068
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I'm tired of this shit.

169
00:10:01,369 --> 00:10:04,942
Speaker 0: I'm tired of uninstalling like nine toolbars when I visit grandma.

170
00:10:06,307 --> 00:10:08,857
Speaker 1: Anyway, I mean, this is an issue that's like 10 years old.

171
00:10:08,877 --> 00:10:09,379
Speaker 0: I know.

172
00:10:09,661 --> 00:10:18,553
Speaker 0: Kind of like how Congress only recently was like, maybe they shouldn't be allowed to make the volume higher on ads on TV now that no one watches TV anymore.

173
00:10:18,574 --> 00:10:20,620
Speaker 1: Good job old guys.

174
00:10:21,582 --> 00:10:25,577
Speaker 0: Why don't we close that barn door that seems to have opened a little while ago?

175
00:10:25,597 --> 00:10:28,713
Speaker 1: Oh, it'll get all warm in here if we don't have the ventilation.

176
00:10:29,034 --> 00:10:30,921
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

177
00:10:30,941 --> 00:10:33,851
Speaker 1: I don't have a news, but I have something I discovered today.

178
00:10:34,112 --> 00:10:38,769
Speaker 1: Oh, so you know, a Google authenticator, which everyone should be using, right?

179
00:10:38,810 --> 00:10:49,856
Speaker 1: The two factor authentication because you know, there's a big problem these days of basically people have shitty passwords and everyone guesses them and then they say they got hacked when really they just had a shitty password.

180
00:10:49,876 --> 00:10:57,544
Speaker 1: I think about over 99% of the time when someone says someone was hacked, it was password got guessed or password got found out.

181
00:10:57,804 --> 00:11:11,123
Speaker 1: Well, if someone finds out my password for something, even though he's a different password for everything, that's okay because they would also need not to only have something I know my password, but to have something I have my phone.

182
00:11:11,485 --> 00:11:16,686
Speaker 1: I'm the only one who has my phone because they need Google authenticator to log into my mails and such, right?

183
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:24,560
Speaker 1: So that is the best security we have in the modern day because the odds of someone stealing your phone and knowing your password are pretty low.

184
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:29,197
Speaker 0: Though, if you're stupid, there's probably a way to steal your phone.

185
00:11:29,218 --> 00:11:37,294
Speaker 1: You'll know your phone is stolen and you can disable it and reset everything before they are able to do it because they're already logged into your mail in your phone.

186
00:11:37,334 --> 00:11:42,013
Speaker 0: They disabled two factor with the settings and then they reset all your passwords.

187
00:11:42,053 --> 00:11:46,130
Speaker 1: Basically, we can do this smart and they physically stole your phone.

188
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:46,933
Speaker 1: You're already fucked.

189
00:11:47,154 --> 00:11:57,420
Speaker 0: Well, the moral, actually, it's interesting because physical security used to be a big deal in computers, but really in the modern era, email security is more important than everything else for normal people.

190
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:57,801
Speaker 0: Yes.

191
00:11:58,042 --> 00:12:02,502
Speaker 0: If your email account gets compromised, you're fucked and there's almost no way to unfuck yourself.

192
00:12:02,643 --> 00:12:08,467
Speaker 1: This is why you need to use two factor authentication for security, even though it may be a hassle, right?

193
00:12:08,788 --> 00:12:09,009
Speaker 1: Yeah.

194
00:12:09,109 --> 00:12:09,390
Speaker 1: Okay.

195
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:11,720
Speaker 1: You say it's a hassle now and you don't use it.

196
00:12:12,001 --> 00:12:19,575
Speaker 1: And then when someone guesses your shitty password that you have as a really easy to guess password because you were lazy and it's a hassle, right?

197
00:12:19,675 --> 00:12:21,421
Speaker 1: I'm going to say, I told you so.

198
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:22,525
Speaker 1: You deserve it.

199
00:12:22,907 --> 00:12:23,790
Speaker 1: Your life is ruined.

200
00:12:24,711 --> 00:12:25,895
Speaker 1: Good job, loser.

201
00:12:26,197 --> 00:12:31,418
Speaker 1: Anyway, so there are other things, though, besides Gmail, you might want to have two factor authentication for.

202
00:12:31,619 --> 00:12:31,840
Speaker 1: Yeah.

203
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,802
Speaker 0: Now, if you're a rich company, you pay for like the RSA little key fobs with the counting down numbers.

204
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:37,425
Speaker 1: Exactly.

205
00:12:37,686 --> 00:12:44,697
Speaker 1: Or you could get a YubiKey, but that requires a piece of hardware that's a USB and can only be used on things with USB like laptops and computers.

206
00:12:44,999 --> 00:12:46,324
Speaker 1: Not really so much as phones.

207
00:12:46,685 --> 00:12:53,527
Speaker 1: So if I like have a YubiKey secured website and a log in for my phone, I can't do that easily.

208
00:12:53,688 --> 00:12:55,374
Speaker 1: That's very hard to do, if not impossible.

209
00:12:55,595 --> 00:12:59,291
Speaker 1: What phone has a USB on it that works and can allow a USB keyboard to be plugged?

210
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:03,367
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, my phone technically has USB storage internally.

211
00:13:03,428 --> 00:13:06,680
Speaker 1: Yes, but what if I probably four pins that I could.

212
00:13:06,981 --> 00:13:07,182
Speaker 1: All right.

213
00:13:07,222 --> 00:13:13,912
Speaker 1: So if you if I take a USB keyboard with a mini adapter and plug it into your phone, well, you can recognize it as a keyboard phone.

214
00:13:14,214 --> 00:13:16,805
Speaker 0: Find the USB pins that are connected to the store.

215
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:21,888
Speaker 1: Even if you did that, does it have the drivers in Android for USB human interface device for keyboards?

216
00:13:21,989 --> 00:13:24,701
Speaker 1: I'm actually kind of curious that so that a keyboard would work.

217
00:13:25,324 --> 00:13:25,545
Speaker 1: Right.

218
00:13:25,645 --> 00:13:26,589
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it'll work.

219
00:13:26,649 --> 00:13:28,598
Speaker 1: I'm saying that's what it would take to make YubiKey.

220
00:13:28,678 --> 00:13:29,301
Speaker 0: It would work.

221
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:37,182
Speaker 1: But anyway, so you really would like to use this Google Authenticator, which is where you just open an app on your phone and it shows you the number and the numbers change all the time.

222
00:13:37,242 --> 00:13:37,443
Speaker 1: Right.

223
00:13:37,986 --> 00:13:39,753
Speaker 1: But that's for Google, right?

224
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:41,099
Speaker 1: It's not for anything else.

225
00:13:41,159 --> 00:13:50,174
Speaker 1: Well, I enabled two factor authentication for Linode this week when they added it and I realized, oh, look, they're using Google Authenticator.

226
00:13:50,214 --> 00:13:50,918
Speaker 1: How are they doing that?

227
00:13:50,938 --> 00:13:52,145
Speaker 1: Did they make a deal with Google?

228
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:53,773
Speaker 1: What what the hell is going on here?

229
00:13:53,814 --> 00:13:54,476
Speaker 1: How they do this.

230
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:56,123
Speaker 1: And here's how they do this.

231
00:13:56,726 --> 00:14:04,264
Speaker 1: There is this completely open thing called TT TOTP time based one time password algorithm.

232
00:14:04,505 --> 00:14:04,745
Speaker 1: Right.

233
00:14:05,467 --> 00:14:09,358
Speaker 1: Or I guess time based one time pad.

234
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,702
Speaker 0: You get the idea.

235
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:11,003
Speaker 1: Yes.

236
00:14:11,244 --> 00:14:16,720
Speaker 1: So the way it works is this Google Authenticator is really just a client for TOTP.

237
00:14:16,801 --> 00:14:18,445
Speaker 1: You can use it with any TOTP.

238
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:19,308
Speaker 1: Right.

239
00:14:19,528 --> 00:14:20,030
Speaker 1: He doesn't have.

240
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,938
Speaker 1: you can even use it as a TOT.

241
00:14:22,018 --> 00:14:24,710
Speaker 1: It basically might as well just call it generic TOTP client.

242
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:30,408
Speaker 1: And Google happens to be using TOTP and it just branded the app with Google.

243
00:14:30,629 --> 00:14:32,358
Speaker 1: But the app actually has nothing to do with Google.

244
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:35,453
Speaker 1: It's like a generic client like MRC is an IRC client.

245
00:14:35,653 --> 00:14:36,938
Speaker 0: So good on Google for that.

246
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:37,360
Speaker 1: Right.

247
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:43,180
Speaker 1: So what you do is you open up your authenticator and you press plus and to add another thing.

248
00:14:43,501 --> 00:14:43,741
Speaker 1: Right.

249
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:48,214
Speaker 1: And you push scan barcode and this will scan a QR code.

250
00:14:48,616 --> 00:14:48,836
Speaker 1: Right.

251
00:14:49,157 --> 00:14:54,110
Speaker 1: To add basically a new client to your Google authenticator.

252
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:01,737
Speaker 1: So when you go to line node and you say add two factor authentication to my phone or account, they display a QR code.

253
00:15:02,018 --> 00:15:03,925
Speaker 1: That QR code has a shared secret.

254
00:15:04,206 --> 00:15:05,693
Speaker 1: You take a picture of it with your phone.

255
00:15:05,974 --> 00:15:09,592
Speaker 1: Now the shared secret is online node and it's in your phone and it's nowhere else.

256
00:15:09,933 --> 00:15:12,043
Speaker 1: And line node will never display that secret again.

257
00:15:12,063 --> 00:15:14,253
Speaker 1: And your phone will never display that secret again.

258
00:15:14,273 --> 00:15:24,667
Speaker 1: And now your phone and line node can use the time of day to the second to figure out, you know, the one time of two factor authentication code.

259
00:15:25,209 --> 00:15:25,871
Speaker 1: And you're all set.

260
00:15:25,911 --> 00:15:26,535
Speaker 1: And there's nothing.

261
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:30,173
Speaker 1: doesn't even have to hit Google's API or anything like that whatsoever.

262
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:30,837
Speaker 1: Google doesn't.

263
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:31,641
Speaker 1: There's no part in it.

264
00:15:31,742 --> 00:15:38,026
Speaker 1: Even though the app says Google, you can in fact get your own TOTP client or write your own TOTP client.

265
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:44,246
Speaker 1: And if you could get the shared secret out of your Google authenticator app, you could use that instead.

266
00:15:44,969 --> 00:15:52,844
Speaker 0: So good listeners, if you're a coder and you know what you're doing, you can really impress your company by having two factor authentication that just works with.

267
00:15:52,924 --> 00:16:07,383
Speaker 1: it's trivial to add two factor authentication to any app that doesn't require the users to spend any money on devices or anything of that nature, as long as everyone has a smartphone that could run Google authenticator, which is every Android and iPhone and possibly others.

268
00:16:07,985 --> 00:16:21,267
Speaker 1: Also, even if they don't have a smartphone, you can use something like Twilio or your own Astra server or something to use text messages or emails for the two factor authentication.

269
00:16:22,069 --> 00:16:24,057
Speaker 1: You just email someone the numbers, right?

270
00:16:24,077 --> 00:16:26,809
Speaker 1: That's what steam does for their two factor, right?

271
00:16:26,909 --> 00:16:31,910
Speaker 1: Emails you a code when you log in from a new computer and it's like, type this code into your steam.

272
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:33,193
Speaker 1: I don't trust you.

273
00:16:33,273 --> 00:16:33,694
Speaker 1: Yeah.

274
00:16:34,798 --> 00:16:52,938
Speaker 0: So in other semi related news, mostly in terms of DRM security and piracy and all that, the internet is a buzz and slash.is angry because Adobe has decided to stop selling thousand plus dollar packages of Adobe products and just have the subscription only Adobe cloud model.

275
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:54,826
Speaker 1: I'm glad I have the Adobe subscription.

276
00:16:55,047 --> 00:16:56,252
Speaker 0: I'm also glad I have that.

277
00:16:56,373 --> 00:16:58,180
Speaker 0: And I think this is a good move for Adobe.

278
00:16:58,742 --> 00:17:01,833
Speaker 0: And I also think it's a good move for me, the consumer.

279
00:17:01,853 --> 00:17:07,769
Speaker 0: and good God are people on slash knee jerk, ridiculous assholes.

280
00:17:07,868 --> 00:17:10,703
Speaker 1: Well, OK, so on the one hand, they have a point.

281
00:17:10,723 --> 00:17:12,330
Speaker 1: And the point is that, well, wait, what do you think?

282
00:17:12,351 --> 00:17:16,972
Speaker 1: slash jobs point is such this point is they want to own the software and pirate it or whatever.

283
00:17:17,012 --> 00:17:20,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much without paying for it, because no one.

284
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:24,808
Speaker 1: basically this means that future versions of Photoshop be unpiratable almost right now.

285
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:26,395
Speaker 1: I'm not going to say that they'll pirate everything.

286
00:17:26,494 --> 00:17:28,924
Speaker 1: But anyway, here's the thing.

287
00:17:29,646 --> 00:17:42,683
Speaker 1: If you pay the fifty bucks a month for the creative cloud, that is right, less money than if you were to buy the master suite of creative suite and keep it upgraded all the time.

288
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:46,958
Speaker 0: Now, the Nard will say, but I don't need to upgrade all the time.

289
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:48,003
Speaker 0: I'm wasting money now.

290
00:17:48,425 --> 00:17:54,847
Speaker 1: This is there are people who want to buy like just Photoshop, CS6 and never upgrade it ever.

291
00:17:54,948 --> 00:18:03,578
Speaker 1: And if you just buy one thing and never upgrade it ever, even for hundreds of dollars, that will in the long run be cheaper than paying for the creative.

292
00:18:03,619 --> 00:18:21,900
Speaker 0: Now, those people say that, but they are very short sighted and usually wrong because I'm sure those people have a perfectly legitimate copy of cool edit that they continue to use to this day on their Windows PC instead of paying the whatever hundreds of dollars for audition.

293
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:31,078
Speaker 0: The fact is, the reason software like this and enterprise software and all those things is so expensive is that there isn't the biggest market for it.

294
00:18:31,539 --> 00:18:37,608
Speaker 0: But simultaneously, it's actually really expensive to have good enough developers and design teams to add features to stuff like this.

295
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:41,769
Speaker 0: If you think you're going to code up a Photoshop competitor in your basement, you're wrong.

296
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:44,859
Speaker 0: And if you think that GIMP is that you're wrong.

297
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,261
Speaker 1: Yeah.

298
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:48,632
Speaker 0: I used to be that way five, 10, not five, 10 years ago.

299
00:18:48,713 --> 00:18:52,005
Speaker 0: I was like, yeah, the GIMP does everything I need and all my art.

300
00:18:52,026 --> 00:18:52,126
Speaker 0: Yeah.

301
00:18:52,146 --> 00:18:57,041
Speaker 0: Cause you're not an artist and you don't know shit about drawing or video or audio.

302
00:18:57,081 --> 00:18:57,241
Speaker 1: Yeah.

303
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:03,807
Speaker 0: One guy on slash I was like, well, I guess I'm just going to go back to the GIMP.

304
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,937
Speaker 0: And the post under that is just brilliant.

305
00:19:06,259 --> 00:19:07,043
Speaker 0: I'll paraphrase.

306
00:19:07,063 --> 00:19:08,450
Speaker 1: At least there was like one brilliant post.

307
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:11,161
Speaker 0: It basically says, yeah, go back to the GIMP.

308
00:19:11,201 --> 00:19:13,350
Speaker 0: That's basically the equivalent of Photoshop.

309
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,397
Speaker 0: CS2 doesn't support shit.

310
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:21,508
Speaker 1: If you think you can get away with the GIMP, I have to pay a hundred dollars a month for my Ferrari instead of a hundred thousand dollars once.

311
00:19:21,769 --> 00:19:24,981
Speaker 1: Well, I guess I'm going back to driving my Pinto.

312
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:30,305
Speaker 0: If you think you can get away with using the GIMP, you never should have been paying for show Photoshop in the first place.

313
00:19:30,466 --> 00:19:31,250
Speaker 1: Exactly.

314
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:32,693
Speaker 1: Exactly.

315
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,788
Speaker 1: If you can get away with the GIMP, why were you using Photoshop?

316
00:19:35,808 --> 00:19:36,652
Speaker 1: Unless you were pirating it?

317
00:19:36,673 --> 00:19:39,368
Speaker 1: and if you were pirating it, why do you care how they charge for it?

318
00:19:39,669 --> 00:19:40,735
Speaker 1: You're just going to pirate it again.

319
00:19:40,755 --> 00:19:42,082
Speaker 0: You can get away with the GIMP.

320
00:19:42,142 --> 00:19:48,464
Speaker 0: If all you do is crop images, change the format of images, apply shitty filters to images.

321
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:50,690
Speaker 0: That's pretty much it.

322
00:19:50,711 --> 00:19:52,976
Speaker 0: Photoshop is just better.

323
00:19:53,537 --> 00:19:56,264
Speaker 0: and yeah, Audacity is, you know, okay.

324
00:19:56,284 --> 00:20:01,667
Speaker 0: But if you know anything about audio, you'll hate Audacity and it won't do anything you want it to do.

325
00:20:01,687 --> 00:20:02,069
Speaker 0: Yeah.

326
00:20:02,089 --> 00:20:04,498
Speaker 1: I mean, this is, you know, pro tools.

327
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,348
Speaker 1: It's not pro tools, it's professional tools,

328
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:17,614
Speaker 0: but the people who say they want to buy it and never upgrade are pretty much always lying because it's always the same people who complain when CS5 comes out and it has new features they don't have in CS4 and they get mad.

329
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:24,686
Speaker 1: But they also complain that they upgrade and it changed and like, oh, I don't like how it changed, but they upgrade anyway.

330
00:20:24,867 --> 00:20:25,991
Speaker 0: That is what I was getting at.

331
00:20:26,272 --> 00:20:37,996
Speaker 0: The most common complaint about this that I see on the internet is that people are mad that now they're just going to get updates to Adobe stuff all the time and they hate it when the UI changes.

332
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:38,679
Speaker 0: Fuck you.

333
00:20:38,719 --> 00:20:43,258
Speaker 0: People like you are holding software back and have been since the dawn of software.

334
00:20:43,418 --> 00:20:47,294
Speaker 0: The people who complained that, oh my God, Office added ribbon menus.

335
00:20:47,314 --> 00:20:48,097
Speaker 0: Well, fuck that.

336
00:20:48,137 --> 00:20:51,290
Speaker 0: I'm using Microsoft works 2000 for the rest of my life.

337
00:20:51,911 --> 00:20:52,795
Speaker 0: You are the problem.

338
00:20:52,956 --> 00:20:54,422
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be working anymore.

339
00:20:54,523 --> 00:20:56,751
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the Scott kind of rant right there.

340
00:20:57,112 --> 00:20:59,979
Speaker 1: Because I do that for a living now.

341
00:20:59,999 --> 00:21:00,520
Speaker 1: You know what?

342
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:11,837
Speaker 0: In my job, I moved a UI element because the old element was poorly designed in the new version and despite release notes, despite no one else's.

343
00:21:11,957 --> 00:21:12,940
Speaker 1: Yeah.

344
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:15,107
Speaker 0: Despite everything.

345
00:21:15,187 --> 00:21:22,813
Speaker 0: And despite the fact that it was clearly superior and clearly intuitive, I had to deal with people who could not figure the new one out.

346
00:21:22,893 --> 00:21:24,157
Speaker 0: That was just better.

347
00:21:24,177 --> 00:21:30,335
Speaker 0: And actually open tickets asking us to restore the functionality they lost.

348
00:21:31,318 --> 00:21:31,539
Speaker 1: Yup.

349
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:37,816
Speaker 0: And it was the equivalent of it's a ribbon menu now in a steadier old file menu.

350
00:21:38,237 --> 00:21:39,782
Speaker 0: They're basically the same.

351
00:21:40,042 --> 00:21:40,283
Speaker 1: Yup.

352
00:21:41,105 --> 00:21:51,023
Speaker 0: People who can't deal with good changes or evolutionary changes or or even revolutionary changes to professional software are no longer professionals, in my opinion.

353
00:21:51,123 --> 00:21:52,108
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

354
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:56,787
Speaker 0: They're no longer professionals in the field that requires the use of that software.

355
00:21:57,008 --> 00:21:57,189
Speaker 1: Right.

356
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,296
Speaker 1: I'm going to bring a tangent rant that's related.

357
00:21:59,537 --> 00:21:59,738
Speaker 1: Right.

358
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:00,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

359
00:22:00,581 --> 00:22:00,902
Speaker 1: Yeah.

360
00:22:00,982 --> 00:22:05,220
Speaker 1: So get, you know, yeah, I'll admit it gets a complicated motherfucker.

361
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:05,441
Speaker 1: Yeah.

362
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,406
Speaker 0: I don't know it that well.

363
00:22:06,526 --> 00:22:10,223
Speaker 0: I have to, I have to reference every time I do anything more complicated than commit.

364
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:10,585
Speaker 1: Right.

365
00:22:10,906 --> 00:22:12,916
Speaker 1: But it's also a powerful motherfucker.

366
00:22:13,036 --> 00:22:14,563
Speaker 1: It's the whole hog.

367
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:15,427
Speaker 0: Back to the whole hog.

368
00:22:15,447 --> 00:22:16,372
Speaker 1: You know that whole hog.

369
00:22:16,453 --> 00:22:18,405
Speaker 0: Everyone who listens to Gignac should know about the whole hog.

370
00:22:18,426 --> 00:22:18,848
Speaker 1: That's right.

371
00:22:18,868 --> 00:22:27,718
Speaker 1: If you haven't searched for a whole hog, H O L E space H A W G. You'll find a, uh, basically an excerpt from the book.

372
00:22:27,798 --> 00:22:29,989
Speaker 1: in the beginning was the command line by Neil Stevenson.

373
00:22:30,029 --> 00:22:31,194
Speaker 1: Read that excerpt anyway.

374
00:22:32,177 --> 00:22:38,601
Speaker 1: So, but everybody these days has to use the get or at least lots of people do, especially with get hub taken over the world.

375
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:44,304
Speaker 0: There's a, I'd say 30% of the people who should be using get are using mercurial because they move.

376
00:22:44,344 --> 00:22:46,553
Speaker 1: You're giving material too much credit.

377
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:46,955
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

378
00:22:46,995 --> 00:22:53,243
Speaker 0: I'm saying they moved to mercurial before get existed or they knew about it and they're not going to move again.

379
00:22:53,263 --> 00:23:13,015
Speaker 1: There's not too many mercurial users left out there in corporate America, even bit bucket, which was the get hub of mercurial added get support and is now basically 60 to 70% of people who need complex revision management are using get.

380
00:23:13,337 --> 00:23:20,908
Speaker 0: the other 30 to higher percent than the other 30 to 40% want to be using it and are stuck currently with the mercurial and are desperately trying.

381
00:23:21,048 --> 00:23:27,480
Speaker 1: I think most people who aren't using get, I think a lot of them are just stuck on subversion or something else like visual source safe.

382
00:23:27,561 --> 00:23:35,634
Speaker 0: I find, luckily the most, most of the people who use subversion as their primary change control are using it for non code where it actually does a pretty good job.

383
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:42,155
Speaker 1: A get is even better at non code, but, but non code implies non coders.

384
00:23:42,175 --> 00:23:48,861
Speaker 0: Do you know how hard it is to explain the concept of revision management to someone whose only job is to draw pictures?

385
00:23:48,981 --> 00:23:51,813
Speaker 1: And this is my point that I was getting to in this rant.

386
00:23:52,335 --> 00:23:54,726
Speaker 1: I don't care if your job is draw pictures, right?

387
00:23:54,987 --> 00:23:57,276
Speaker 1: Are you a professional picture drawer, right?

388
00:23:57,757 --> 00:24:00,729
Speaker 1: Are you working with people on a digital product?

389
00:24:00,769 --> 00:24:05,166
Speaker 1: Maybe you are drawing pictures for a website or drawing pictures for an application, right?

390
00:24:05,186 --> 00:24:10,423
Speaker 1: I don't care if get is primarily a programmer's tool, right?

391
00:24:10,524 --> 00:24:12,289
Speaker 1: It is a revision control tool.

392
00:24:12,329 --> 00:24:15,646
Speaker 1: It doesn't care if you're working with code or pictures or videos or whatever, right?

393
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,996
Speaker 1: And it is a tool you need to learn for your job.

394
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:20,888
Speaker 1: If you are professional fucking learn it.

395
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:26,324
Speaker 0: None of these easy cover up thing is not the problem.

396
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:38,590
Speaker 0: The reason is that people don't have to learn it for their jobs because the majority of companies do not have good processes and everything's so slow and inefficient that it doesn't matter if they know how to use good tools or not.

397
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:40,678
Speaker 0: It'll be just as slow.

398
00:24:40,738 --> 00:24:42,144
Speaker 1: It's true, but I see many.

399
00:24:42,204 --> 00:24:43,972
Speaker 0: I'm going beyond you and I'm going to say this.

400
00:24:44,313 --> 00:24:47,687
Speaker 0: Yes, you can probably get a job to make just fine money.

401
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:48,530
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, you can

402
00:24:48,771 --> 00:25:02,954
Speaker 0: if you're, if you only know how to do one thing and do it well, but the people who will be employed for their entire lives, the people who will make ridiculous money, the people who will run shit are the people who know how to do one thing really well and know how to use computers,

403
00:25:02,994 --> 00:25:03,155
Speaker 1: right?

404
00:25:03,175 --> 00:25:04,864
Speaker 1: But this is not the aspect I was getting at.

405
00:25:04,884 --> 00:25:26,725
Speaker 1: The aspect I am getting at is that you look online and even in hacker communities of programmers, people are making things such as the very popular get flow and all the and gooeys and all these cover ups of the get command line to sort of limit its power into just a few things so that someone who's a dumb ass can still use it without having to learn it.

406
00:25:26,765 --> 00:25:27,770
Speaker 1: They don't want to learn it.

407
00:25:27,791 --> 00:25:29,840
Speaker 1: They say, I don't want to learn that complicated thing.

408
00:25:29,861 --> 00:25:33,233
Speaker 0: I want to, but I ask God, you're so mad you.

409
00:25:33,855 --> 00:25:42,938
Speaker 0: So in two years I have not touched a knob on the compressor and I had to touch a knob because how angry you are right now.

410
00:25:43,078 --> 00:25:43,600
Speaker 1: Okay.

411
00:25:44,262 --> 00:25:49,399
Speaker 1: But the point is if you're a professional, you should fucking learn that shit.

412
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:51,249
Speaker 1: Don't be like, Oh, I want to cover it up.

413
00:25:51,289 --> 00:25:51,390
Speaker 1: Yeah.

414
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:58,541
Speaker 1: If you're covering it up and making it easy for yourself or reducing the power and cause you're avoiding learning, you are not a professional.

415
00:25:58,621 --> 00:25:59,786
Speaker 0: Now don't get us wrong.

416
00:26:00,147 --> 00:26:02,316
Speaker 0: You might still be really good at drawing pictures.

417
00:26:02,598 --> 00:26:03,602
Speaker 0: I know Scott really well.

418
00:26:03,662 --> 00:26:04,606
Speaker 0: Don't get us wrong.

419
00:26:04,928 --> 00:26:09,383
Speaker 0: We are not saying that intelligent defaults and gooeys are a problem.

420
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:16,224
Speaker 0: A good gooey is always better than a good command line, except the barrier, the bottom level.

421
00:26:16,264 --> 00:26:20,037
Speaker 0: to being good gooey is unattainable by the majority of UI designers.

422
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:24,173
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't even make gooeys that are that good or that transcendent.

423
00:26:24,193 --> 00:26:26,465
Speaker 1: There are git gooeys that are good gooeys.

424
00:26:26,706 --> 00:26:37,318
Speaker 1: There are some that are bad, but the good ones and the bad ones both severely reduce the power of git by reducing the things that you can do, right?

425
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:42,339
Speaker 1: The only way to actually use and understand all of git is to use the command line.

426
00:26:42,359 --> 00:26:43,223
Speaker 1: There is no other way.

427
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:44,990
Speaker 1: That's just, it's just so powerful.

428
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:47,059
Speaker 1: There's so many buttons and knobs, right?

429
00:26:47,541 --> 00:26:48,545
Speaker 1: It's like a whole hog.

430
00:26:48,585 --> 00:26:52,666
Speaker 1: If you, you know, and using a gooey on top of it is like using a cheap plastic drill.

431
00:26:52,706 --> 00:26:54,073
Speaker 1: Again, you might as well not use git.

432
00:26:54,194 --> 00:26:56,747
Speaker 1: It'd be, you know, you're, you're limiting its power so much.

433
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:58,494
Speaker 1: Why don't you just use subversion then?

434
00:26:58,514 --> 00:26:58,554
Speaker 1: So

435
00:26:59,698 --> 00:27:18,385
Speaker 0: to get back to the news and the main point of this, uh, my main point is simply that the people who are complaining that the UIs of their professional software are changing are one of the biggest problems in corporate, not America, corporate world today, because that is why so much software is so stagnant.

436
00:27:18,666 --> 00:27:33,863
Speaker 0: If you're, if you're actually a professional audio engineer and you know your shit, if you load up audition one day and some stuffs move around, you'll not only notice that it moved, but you'll understand where it moved and why intuitively almost all the time.

437
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:41,790
Speaker 0: And if you can't, either you're not actually a professional or that software got worse and it's very rarely the latter.

438
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:53,922
Speaker 1: Usually it's that you didn't learn, you know, like if you learn word processing, you can use Microsoft and you've used Microsoft word your whole life and I give you Abby word and say use this or I give you Libre office and I say, use this.

439
00:27:54,726 --> 00:27:57,619
Speaker 1: You should be able to just use it without having to ask any questions.

440
00:27:57,820 --> 00:28:04,362
Speaker 1: If you use, if you understand the concept of word processing, but too many people learn, for example, they learn a workflow or a product.

441
00:28:08,131 --> 00:28:11,823
Speaker 0: They don't learn a concept or a skill, right?

442
00:28:11,863 --> 00:28:21,405
Speaker 1: If you learn a Microsoft word to the, and you only just remembered specific buttons to press in Microsoft word in a specific order such that if Microsoft word changes, you don't know what to do.

443
00:28:21,506 --> 00:28:23,456
Speaker 1: Or if you have to use open office, you don't know what to do.

444
00:28:24,462 --> 00:28:26,092
Speaker 1: Then you didn't really know what the hell you were doing.

445
00:28:26,394 --> 00:28:26,575
Speaker 1: Right.

446
00:28:26,615 --> 00:28:28,064
Speaker 1: And I don't want to hire that kind of person.

447
00:28:28,104 --> 00:28:33,435
Speaker 1: I want to hire someone who if they know word processing and can use any word processor, I want to know someone who knows audio engineering.

448
00:28:33,716 --> 00:28:38,900
Speaker 1: And if I, if one workplace they go to as Pro tools and another one has audition, they should be just fine.

449
00:28:39,201 --> 00:28:46,195
Speaker 1: If they have a problem switching like that and they just can't figure out the differences on their own, that's not a person of high skill who I want to hire.

450
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:54,814
Speaker 1: And I would probably, if I was hiring people, that's the kind of thing I would try to figure out is like, Oh, can this person, do they really understand the core concepts?

451
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:57,286
Speaker 1: Could they do their job using a different tool set?

452
00:28:57,447 --> 00:28:59,942
Speaker 0: Well, that's why I noticed how, like when I interview people, when

453
00:29:00,002 --> 00:29:01,511
Speaker 1: it would be always no one to hire, when people

454
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:11,695
Speaker 0: like us interview programmers, a lot of times, at least I will, I'll ask them just to make sure that they know what they're doing to explain to me how they would go about architecting a simple problem in code.

455
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:16,657
Speaker 0: Because if they can't without reference, I don't need them to write code in front of me by hand.

456
00:29:16,698 --> 00:29:17,220
Speaker 0: That's stupid.

457
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:27,279
Speaker 0: But if they can't like get the concept across of how they would do something in a vacuum, then they probably couldn't write code to do that thing, given all the reference in the world.

458
00:29:28,342 --> 00:29:32,999
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is a great thing for Adobe to be doing for very simple reasons.

459
00:29:33,381 --> 00:29:35,027
Speaker 0: One, it's not to prevent piracy.

460
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:36,573
Speaker 0: This is not why they're doing it.

461
00:29:37,216 --> 00:29:39,988
Speaker 0: It's going to indoctrinate more people to use their software.

462
00:29:40,169 --> 00:29:46,776
Speaker 0: Cause it was just 50 bucks a month, probably with student discounts and whatever, instead of thousands of dollars every year or so.

463
00:29:46,796 --> 00:29:54,805
Speaker 0: And you get every Adobe product instead of paying the thousand plus dollars just for a subset like production premium, like I used to do.

464
00:29:55,628 --> 00:29:58,258
Speaker 0: I'm using a lot of Adobe software I never would have touched before.

465
00:29:58,599 --> 00:30:04,096
Speaker 0: My entire workflow of media has moved entirely within Adobe software.

466
00:30:04,558 --> 00:30:05,742
Speaker 0: I can't leave now.

467
00:30:06,324 --> 00:30:07,729
Speaker 1: I don't even use it that much.

468
00:30:07,769 --> 00:30:09,136
Speaker 1: I could leave, but it became in the ads.

469
00:30:09,196 --> 00:30:13,538
Speaker 1: It's like I use Lightroom a ton and I use Premiere probably second most and Photoshop third most.

470
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,608
Speaker 1: I really don't use a lot of the other stuff.

471
00:30:15,849 --> 00:30:17,418
Speaker 0: I use After Effects, InDesign.

472
00:30:17,459 --> 00:30:18,505
Speaker 1: I use After Effects a little bit.

473
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,250
Speaker 0: I'm using it more and more.

474
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,558
Speaker 0: I'm using InDesign more and more.

475
00:30:20,638 --> 00:30:22,509
Speaker 1: I uninstalled InDesign because I couldn't figure it out.

476
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:23,677
Speaker 0: You know what you're going to use it for?

477
00:30:23,697 --> 00:30:25,730
Speaker 0: If you publish a tabletop game, InDesign.

478
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:26,674
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

479
00:30:26,714 --> 00:30:26,916
Speaker 1: Yeah.

480
00:30:27,278 --> 00:30:28,042
Speaker 0: But I'll teach you.

481
00:30:28,102 --> 00:30:28,645
Speaker 0: I'm starting to learn.

482
00:30:28,686 --> 00:30:34,591
Speaker 1: I actually installed Flash Builder, which is a fork of Eclipse that lets you make Flash apps and things like that.

483
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:36,261
Speaker 1: And I was like, whoa, I didn't know this.

484
00:30:36,463 --> 00:30:39,339
Speaker 1: I sort of knew it existed, but I was like, whoa, this is actually pretty great.

485
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,846
Speaker 0: Also Adobe media encoder.

486
00:30:40,867 --> 00:30:41,871
Speaker 0: I'm using it a lot more.

487
00:30:42,393 --> 00:30:44,660
Speaker 0: Not just exporting out of Premiere.

488
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:51,962
Speaker 1: I use that the most because I'll record everything with fraps and I'll just turn them into MP4s and delete the raws.

489
00:30:52,102 --> 00:30:53,266
Speaker 1: So anyway, two.

490
00:30:53,807 --> 00:30:57,706
Speaker 0: Now anyone who's using Adobe software is always going to have the current version.

491
00:30:57,726 --> 00:31:05,156
Speaker 0: You never have to again deal with that shitty contractor who actually only has CS3 and can't import the file you gave him with revisions.

492
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:06,581
Speaker 1: Three.

493
00:31:07,283 --> 00:31:17,599
Speaker 0: The reason all this enterprise software sucks is because the old model of pay for it doesn't work when you actually need to keep updating the software to fit with modern times.

494
00:31:17,879 --> 00:31:20,146
Speaker 0: Shit's changed since Kool Edit came out.

495
00:31:21,209 --> 00:31:23,818
Speaker 0: I need to be able to edit five point one surround audio.

496
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,564
Speaker 0: Old Kool Edit can't do that.

497
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:25,926
Speaker 1: Nope.

498
00:31:26,508 --> 00:31:28,074
Speaker 0: Audition can do that.

499
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:28,556
Speaker 0: Yeah.

500
00:31:28,656 --> 00:31:31,207
Speaker 0: Audition can do more things than Kool Edit could.

501
00:31:31,307 --> 00:31:32,471
Speaker 1: Even Vermeer can do that.

502
00:31:32,492 --> 00:31:32,652
Speaker 1: Yeah.

503
00:31:33,033 --> 00:31:33,294
Speaker 1: Anyway.

504
00:31:33,555 --> 00:31:35,462
Speaker 0: So anyway, this is great for Adobe.

505
00:31:35,582 --> 00:31:41,264
Speaker 0: And I've seen almost no legitimate complaints other than I want to pirate it, but you still can.

506
00:31:41,284 --> 00:31:44,212
Speaker 0: Non-professionals or people are being disingenuous about why they're mad.

507
00:31:44,452 --> 00:31:44,732
Speaker 1: OK.

508
00:31:50,317 --> 00:31:53,160
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

509
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:55,588
Speaker 1: So do you remember at the famous penguicon?

510
00:31:56,230 --> 00:32:08,598
Speaker 0: The penguicon where Neil Gaiman, the only penguicon we went to and told stories to us and hung out with our friends and Steve Jackson made that chaos machine and we totally blew him off because we didn't know who he was.

511
00:32:08,618 --> 00:32:10,004
Speaker 1: So the chaos machine.

512
00:32:10,385 --> 00:32:15,528
Speaker 0: We had Wi-Fi on a cell phone driving through Canada in an era where none of us had cell phones.

513
00:32:15,548 --> 00:32:15,649
Speaker 1: Right.

514
00:32:15,669 --> 00:32:16,776
Speaker 1: But I'm talking about the chaos machine.

515
00:32:16,957 --> 00:32:19,892
Speaker 0: OK, so the chaos machine is basically Marble Works unplugged.

516
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:21,158
Speaker 1: It was crazy as Marble Works.

517
00:32:21,198 --> 00:32:23,954
Speaker 0: I will link to some pictures of the chaos machine that I found recently.

518
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:26,605
Speaker 1: So what did we try to do with the chaos machine that we failed to do?

519
00:32:27,408 --> 00:32:28,612
Speaker 0: Perfect error handling.

520
00:32:29,877 --> 00:32:31,202
Speaker 0: No, that's what we tried to do.

521
00:32:31,222 --> 00:32:32,167
Speaker 0: That's what I was trying to do.

522
00:32:32,448 --> 00:32:35,261
Speaker 1: Me and Steve Pomeroy attempted to make an adder.

523
00:32:35,281 --> 00:32:36,527
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

524
00:32:36,567 --> 00:32:37,270
Speaker 0: You were doing that.

525
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,576
Speaker 0: I was trying to deal with.

526
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:39,942
Speaker 0: occasionally a ball would pop out.

527
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:43,882
Speaker 0: I was trying to make a system that would catch all the errors and feed them back in.

528
00:32:44,183 --> 00:32:45,509
Speaker 0: So the machine would run forever.

529
00:32:45,911 --> 00:32:46,111
Speaker 1: Right.

530
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,437
Speaker 1: So the batteries ran out.

531
00:32:47,497 --> 00:32:48,703
Speaker 1: No, it was plugged into the wall.

532
00:32:48,763 --> 00:32:49,687
Speaker 1: I had the elevator.

533
00:32:49,727 --> 00:32:50,009
Speaker 1: Remember.

534
00:32:50,370 --> 00:32:50,872
Speaker 1: Right.

535
00:32:50,913 --> 00:32:55,491
Speaker 0: But we got to a point where the elevator could not deal with the load because too many balls were in it.

536
00:32:55,652 --> 00:32:55,833
Speaker 0: Right.

537
00:32:55,853 --> 00:32:56,375
Speaker 0: Too tall.

538
00:32:56,837 --> 00:32:57,941
Speaker 0: But so I got.

539
00:32:57,961 --> 00:33:01,879
Speaker 1: that was so we couldn't make an adder because there was no way to store state.

540
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:10,338
Speaker 1: We basically needed a switch to make an adder, something that when a marble hit, it would flip such that the next marble would do something different than the previous marble.

541
00:33:10,479 --> 00:33:14,436
Speaker 0: I believe there was one switch that would flip between go left, go right.

542
00:33:14,456 --> 00:33:15,782
Speaker 0: It would always go left and right.

543
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:17,734
Speaker 1: But we couldn't use it to store a state.

544
00:33:17,774 --> 00:33:17,935
Speaker 1: Right.

545
00:33:17,955 --> 00:33:19,886
Speaker 1: We needed to do something if a ball came in the right.

546
00:33:20,207 --> 00:33:25,392
Speaker 1: And if another the next ball, like the first ball that comes in the right, like you need to store a state.

547
00:33:25,432 --> 00:33:26,778
Speaker 1: And we couldn't do that anyway.

548
00:33:26,958 --> 00:33:34,109
Speaker 0: Now, if you just have things, if you just have a series of things that flip and the first ball goes left and left and go right, you could do stuff with just that.

549
00:33:34,751 --> 00:33:41,371
Speaker 1: So here is a guy who has made an adding machine out of wood using marbles.

550
00:33:41,652 --> 00:33:45,304
Speaker 1: This actually was uploaded in 2007, but I didn't see it until today.

551
00:33:45,324 --> 00:33:49,720
Speaker 1: And it's pretty much an adder made of wood that uses marbles.

552
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,184
Speaker 0: You know, it's interesting.

553
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:59,600
Speaker 0: That design looks almost identical to a machine that I made with a bunch of my friends for an event in Science Olympiad called Mission Possible.

554
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,167
Speaker 0: Because so this is great.

555
00:34:02,268 --> 00:34:05,863
Speaker 0: We entered the first year and the rules were like, you make a Rube Goldberg machine.

556
00:34:05,883 --> 00:34:07,531
Speaker 0: You get points for all this bullshit.

557
00:34:07,973 --> 00:34:13,931
Speaker 0: And then you also get points based on how close to exactly two minutes your machine runs to completion.

558
00:34:14,692 --> 00:34:19,808
Speaker 0: So we had a clock that we made out of wood with a pendulum.

559
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:28,947
Speaker 0: And then we had a Rube Goldberg machine that did all this bullshit as fast as possible, million points, and then waited a minute and forty five seconds and then did the last thing.

560
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:33,748
Speaker 0: Next year, they changed the rules and said that you can't have parallel processes like that.

561
00:34:34,271 --> 00:34:35,396
Speaker 0: So we found a loophole.

562
00:34:35,677 --> 00:34:38,409
Speaker 0: We made a machine that looks exactly like what you just showed me.

563
00:34:38,429 --> 00:34:39,856
Speaker 0: That would basically.

564
00:34:39,876 --> 00:34:49,474
Speaker 0: the only difference is our channels had holes at certain points so that when the state machine got to a certain point, it would trigger behavior to continue the Rube Goldberg machine.

565
00:34:50,197 --> 00:34:53,068
Speaker 0: And we won again and they changed the rules again to prevent us from doing that.

566
00:34:54,333 --> 00:34:56,100
Speaker 1: Anyway, this is an adder.

567
00:34:56,340 --> 00:35:07,944
Speaker 1: If you were if you wanted to know how your computer or a pocket calculator adds things together, which it pretty much does constantly, this is how it does it only with electricity instead of marvels.

568
00:35:08,266 --> 00:35:10,376
Speaker 0: Now, that's when computers get kind of amazing.

569
00:35:10,396 --> 00:35:16,314
Speaker 0: I mean, you think about one megahertz, one million things per second going on.

570
00:35:16,555 --> 00:35:22,613
Speaker 1: So adding shit every time one of the things in this machine goes click, that is a hurt, basically.

571
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:26,404
Speaker 1: So one hurt, not a million of them in a second.

572
00:35:26,625 --> 00:35:30,756
Speaker 0: So my computer's processor is a lot of gigahertz.

573
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:31,579
Speaker 0: Yeah.

574
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:33,425
Speaker 0: And it's just adding bits together.

575
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:34,910
Speaker 1: Oh, and isn't it quad core?

576
00:35:35,291 --> 00:35:35,613
Speaker 1: Yeah.

577
00:35:35,673 --> 00:35:39,307
Speaker 1: So it can do for it's at the same time if you programmed it to do so.

578
00:35:39,548 --> 00:35:44,249
Speaker 0: My computer can play video and all it's doing is adding numbers together over and over and over again.

579
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:44,712
Speaker 0: Yeah.

580
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:47,363
Speaker 0: And you might think, but rim, it's also subtracting now.

581
00:35:47,704 --> 00:35:51,496
Speaker 1: It's subtracting is adding and multiplying is also adding.

582
00:35:51,656 --> 00:35:51,917
Speaker 0: Yep.

583
00:35:52,399 --> 00:35:55,390
Speaker 1: Dividing is also adding and shifting.

584
00:35:55,751 --> 00:35:59,103
Speaker 0: Now I've got a GPU that has some more specialized functions, but we digress.

585
00:35:59,384 --> 00:36:00,066
Speaker 1: Yeah.

586
00:36:00,127 --> 00:36:01,994
Speaker 1: Everything your computer does is adding.

587
00:36:02,014 --> 00:36:02,435
Speaker 1: Yep.

588
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:05,726
Speaker 0: Or you've got a complex instruction that does well.

589
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:10,901
Speaker 1: Your computer ads, shifts, copies, moves and writes and reads.

590
00:36:10,941 --> 00:36:13,393
Speaker 0: We did a show on risk and CISC a long time ago, right?

591
00:36:13,454 --> 00:36:14,720
Speaker 0: Probably pretty sure we did.

592
00:36:14,860 --> 00:36:16,206
Speaker 1: We did a show on architectures.

593
00:36:16,507 --> 00:36:19,380
Speaker 0: Anyway, my thing of the day, this is just kind of cool.

594
00:36:19,521 --> 00:36:20,224
Speaker 0: It's really short.

595
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:21,710
Speaker 0: I'm going to do more stuff with it later.

596
00:36:22,252 --> 00:36:26,552
Speaker 0: So last year on the eve of hurricane Sandy, Scott and I were at burning apocalypse.

597
00:36:26,572 --> 00:36:27,496
Speaker 0: Well, just burning con.

598
00:36:27,516 --> 00:36:29,346
Speaker 1: I think it was burning apocalypse.

599
00:36:29,426 --> 00:36:32,383
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know if it was called that or if it was just called burning con again.

600
00:36:32,503 --> 00:36:41,264
Speaker 1: I think it was, it was burning con the triad under it because not only was the first burning con was burning con, then burning apocalypse con, then burning con the triad under it.

601
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:42,128
Speaker 1: Cause it was the third one.

602
00:36:42,148 --> 00:36:48,574
Speaker 1: And because it was not just Luke crane and Vince Baker's games, it was also the guy forgets in the game.

603
00:36:48,635 --> 00:36:56,817
Speaker 0: So I can, I participated in a four hour, 100% in character LARP called inheritance run by Lou Crane.

604
00:36:57,398 --> 00:37:03,937
Speaker 0: It was easily one of the three or four greatest role playing or gaming experiences of my entire life.

605
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,668
Speaker 0: And this is that entire four hour game.

606
00:37:07,688 --> 00:37:14,551
Speaker 0: In about 11 seconds we had a camera take a time lapse photo and I just ran it at 30 frames per second.

607
00:37:15,394 --> 00:37:21,100
Speaker 0: And it's just kind of cool to watch and I'm going to have more things about this later, like a slowed down version and whatever.

608
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:22,867
Speaker 0: But this is my thing of the day.

609
00:37:22,887 --> 00:37:24,112
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool to watch.

610
00:37:24,373 --> 00:37:25,980
Speaker 0: And yes, that is Vincent Baker.

611
00:37:26,161 --> 00:37:27,085
Speaker 0: I'm standing over.

612
00:37:27,105 --> 00:37:29,936
Speaker 0: I murdered him because the priestess told me to right.

613
00:37:30,037 --> 00:37:33,670
Speaker 1: Oh, also John Harper is the third guy whose games that you could play anyway.

614
00:37:34,412 --> 00:37:37,203
Speaker 0: So, uh, we should go quick on this book.

615
00:37:37,223 --> 00:37:38,429
Speaker 1: club book is player of games.

616
00:37:38,529 --> 00:37:39,394
Speaker 1: I finished reading it.

617
00:37:39,635 --> 00:37:40,459
Speaker 0: I haven't started yet.

618
00:37:40,821 --> 00:37:43,471
Speaker 1: I am now reading the first book in the culture series.

619
00:37:43,491 --> 00:37:45,720
Speaker 1: Flip is considered or consider Phlebas.

620
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:46,665
Speaker 1: I'm not sure which one it is.

621
00:37:46,766 --> 00:37:53,482
Speaker 0: If it starts raining, I'll probably finish the book pretty quick because I'll be reading it on my commute, but it's been sunny and I've been biking every day for now.

622
00:37:53,723 --> 00:37:53,884
Speaker 1: Yup.

623
00:37:54,286 --> 00:37:55,653
Speaker 0: We've got a bunch of video on the internet.

624
00:37:55,954 --> 00:37:59,734
Speaker 0: We're going to be at Connecticut doing a bunch of panels and running the panels and workshops.

625
00:37:59,834 --> 00:38:01,785
Speaker 1: All that matters right now is anime Boston.

626
00:38:01,805 --> 00:38:06,049
Speaker 0: We're going to be at anime Boston doing not one, not two, not three, not six, not four, but five.

627
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,944
Speaker 1: All you need to know is that we'll be at anime Boston and you'll see us there.

628
00:38:08,984 --> 00:38:10,173
Speaker 0: Emily will also be doing a lecture.

629
00:38:10,193 --> 00:38:11,422
Speaker 0: A friend Judith will also be doing a lecture.

630
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:12,085
Speaker 0: A bunch of people.

631
00:38:12,105 --> 00:38:13,534
Speaker 1: We don't need all the details.

632
00:38:13,574 --> 00:38:14,660
Speaker 1: Just say, go to anime Boston.

633
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,343
Speaker 1: Let's move on.

634
00:38:15,403 --> 00:38:15,886
Speaker 0: Look for us.

635
00:38:16,268 --> 00:38:17,675
Speaker 0: We're going to be at PAX Australia.

636
00:38:17,896 --> 00:38:23,435
Speaker 0: We're probably going to be at PAX dev and packs us or a pecs prime and then packs east again.

637
00:38:23,716 --> 00:38:27,588
Speaker 0: Magfest, Magfest, then paxies video forums, grand prix.

638
00:38:28,291 --> 00:38:29,495
Speaker 1: So, Oh yeah.

639
00:38:29,535 --> 00:38:31,020
Speaker 1: The grand prix backgammon round ended.

640
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:32,766
Speaker 1: New round starts tomorrow.

641
00:38:32,867 --> 00:38:35,618
Speaker 1: Anyone who wasn't playing backgammon, you have a chance.

642
00:38:35,879 --> 00:38:36,743
Speaker 1: Come back and play.

643
00:38:36,763 --> 00:38:39,053
Speaker 1: This one's going to be easier logistic.

644
00:38:39,113 --> 00:38:39,896
Speaker 0: What did I say?

645
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:42,771
Speaker 0: People are going to abuse the doubling cube to get an advantage.

646
00:38:42,791 --> 00:38:44,037
Speaker 0: They didn't get an advantage.

647
00:38:44,077 --> 00:38:48,599
Speaker 1: They basically fucked themselves because a lot of the people who, this is what I said, right?

648
00:38:48,639 --> 00:38:51,169
Speaker 1: It's like, sure, you doubled and you lost.

649
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:57,737
Speaker 1: basically these people were doubling in the game to pump up the score of the person who was beating them while the person was beating them.

650
00:38:57,757 --> 00:39:07,243
Speaker 1: And then of course, if I had used that other, if I had used that as the tiebreaker, that person would have been severely punished because they were stupid and give a bunch of points to someone else.

651
00:39:07,263 --> 00:39:11,504
Speaker 1: So Scott, but they were also punishing other people with the same number of wins as them.

652
00:39:11,705 --> 00:39:11,966
Speaker 1: Yes.

653
00:39:12,066 --> 00:39:13,010
Speaker 0: Which was the thing.

654
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,763
Speaker 1: They brought themselves down and also brought others down.

655
00:39:15,783 --> 00:39:26,531
Speaker 0: What you failed to account for is that knowing that this is a possibility, roughly a third of the players were going to take advantage of another third to use that to greatly enhance their tiebreaker.

656
00:39:26,591 --> 00:39:27,637
Speaker 1: Here's what I could have done.

657
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:29,604
Speaker 1: I realized only now, right?

658
00:39:30,086 --> 00:39:36,607
Speaker 1: Is that what I should have used as the, as the tiebreaker was not opponent wins as in strength of schedule.

659
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:42,446
Speaker 1: It should have been how many points you gave up to your opponents in total, right?

660
00:39:42,686 --> 00:39:44,812
Speaker 0: I suggested that early on.

661
00:39:44,852 --> 00:39:45,695
Speaker 0: Yes, I did.

662
00:39:46,076 --> 00:39:53,261
Speaker 1: That way you would be punished for how bad you sucked as opposed to rewarded for how hard your opponents were doing.

663
00:39:53,522 --> 00:39:55,285
Speaker 0: Anyway, Grand Prix.

664
00:39:55,626 --> 00:39:55,826
Speaker 1: Yup.

665
00:39:56,487 --> 00:40:01,918
Speaker 0: So someday, someday Scott is going to die.

666
00:40:02,519 --> 00:40:03,963
Speaker 0: Gabe and Tyco are going to die.

667
00:40:04,325 --> 00:40:06,554
Speaker 0: Hero from mega Tokyo is going to die.

668
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:07,558
Speaker 1: Obama's going to die.

669
00:40:07,578 --> 00:40:08,301
Speaker 0: The awesome lady.

670
00:40:08,321 --> 00:40:09,848
Speaker 1: Though I do not threaten his life.

671
00:40:09,968 --> 00:40:10,852
Speaker 0: Nor do I.

672
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:13,241
Speaker 1: Don't come secret service again to Rims house.

673
00:40:13,782 --> 00:40:18,773
Speaker 0: All human beings who are alive today are likely to die.

674
00:40:18,793 --> 00:40:20,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

675
00:40:20,978 --> 00:40:24,548
Speaker 1: So even a baby that was born just now will die one day.

676
00:40:24,568 --> 00:40:38,088
Speaker 0: Well, well, so I say likely because statistically, because of how many people live today compared to how many people have likely ever lived, the statistical death rate is not a hundred percent.

677
00:40:39,051 --> 00:40:46,662
Speaker 1: Maybe, but, uh, even if we discover some sort of way to like cut telomeres so that they stop shrinking and you won't die by getting old.

678
00:40:46,682 --> 00:40:50,514
Speaker 1: If you live long enough, you're likely to die by car accident.

679
00:40:50,915 --> 00:40:56,798
Speaker 0: So all I'm saying is that statistically the death rate of humans is not a hundred percent.

680
00:40:56,858 --> 00:41:04,368
Speaker 1: I disagree because if you live long enough, the odds of getting in a car accident approach, you study humans, forget your anecdotal bullshit.

681
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:22,356
Speaker 0: If you study humans, the dad, the absolute death rate, which doesn't just include firearm deaths and car deaths, but kids starving to death in Africa, the death rate is still not a hundred percent because so many people are being born so fast compared to the number of people who have ever died.

682
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,003
Speaker 1: I don't think like, anyway, you will die.

683
00:41:24,906 --> 00:41:31,368
Speaker 0: So many statistical articles talking about this amusing statistical anomaly that might not be rectified.

684
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,897
Speaker 1: Everyone who is Bible bet all my life.

685
00:41:34,078 --> 00:41:39,096
Speaker 1: That's everyone who was born now and born for the foreseeable future will one day die.

686
00:41:39,197 --> 00:41:42,809
Speaker 0: Oh yes, but I'm saying that the statistical rate is not a hundred percent ever.

687
00:41:43,411 --> 00:41:55,312
Speaker 0: And I think it's probably too late for us, but I think there will be, we're on, we're on the cusp as humans of having people who are effectively ageless.

688
00:41:55,352 --> 00:41:55,533
Speaker 1: Yeah.

689
00:41:55,573 --> 00:42:01,074
Speaker 1: When we discover, I said the genetic engineering to, you know, make telomeres stop ruining themselves.

690
00:42:01,415 --> 00:42:05,734
Speaker 1: We will have people that basically don't age and will only die of, they'll be like elves.

691
00:42:05,774 --> 00:42:11,338
Speaker 1: The only desire of disease or murder car crashes or crazy or murderers or poison or whatever.

692
00:42:11,358 --> 00:42:20,209
Speaker 0: But anyway, I'm saying is that that'll let that, I think it is possible that in my dying days I will see the first people for whom this is true.

693
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:24,566
Speaker 1: I hope that they do not discover it when I am very old and then try to give it to me.

694
00:42:24,666 --> 00:42:28,322
Speaker 1: Thus locking me in at oldness forever unless they can also rejuvenate.

695
00:42:28,563 --> 00:42:29,526
Speaker 1: Very unlikely.

696
00:42:29,546 --> 00:42:29,566
Speaker 1: I

697
00:42:30,188 --> 00:42:51,100
Speaker 0: think what I'm really hoping for is that we have the ability to dub or record or store the state of an existing brain and that I do not succumb to severe senility so that there will be an ability to record some simulacra of my personality and put it on the internet to piss around and annoy people for the rest of eternity.

698
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:56,651
Speaker 1: Is not the data I have already placed on the internet very close to that simulacra?

699
00:42:57,252 --> 00:43:08,674
Speaker 0: I would not realize, people who listen to geek nights but do not know us in person tend to have the opposite idea of what our two personalities are like in the real world.

700
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:13,994
Speaker 1: That may be so, but it is an inaccurate simulacra, but a simulacra nonetheless.

701
00:43:14,014 --> 00:43:14,335
Speaker 0: It is.

702
00:43:14,596 --> 00:43:15,660
Speaker 0: Our simulacra are out there.

703
00:43:15,860 --> 00:43:23,706
Speaker 0: How many kids are changing and saying penis on the Parthenon even though they're not really sure of where that came from?

704
00:43:24,208 --> 00:43:24,489
Speaker 1: None.

705
00:43:24,811 --> 00:43:38,234
Speaker 1: But yeah, I put as many bits on the internet as I can, perhaps, you know, I guess, I don't know what the word would be, but it is a vain attempt at grasping immortality of the digital nature.

706
00:43:38,254 --> 00:43:47,032
Speaker 0: Because while I cannot likely be immortal, I would like for there to be some kid somewhere who's listening to geek nights and looking at the memes I put out there basically becomes me.

707
00:43:47,132 --> 00:44:04,780
Speaker 0: And I would love for someone else, because I'm not going to do it, to write a sci-fi story where a guy basically programs a series of memes on the internet such that someday in the future, a child will grow up, encounter all of these memes, and his personality will be reprogrammed to be exactly that person.

708
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:08,169
Speaker 1: That sounds exactly like Diamond Age.

709
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,974
Speaker 0: Not Diamond Age.

710
00:44:10,114 --> 00:44:11,539
Speaker 1: Also Ready Player One.

711
00:44:11,579 --> 00:44:12,361
Speaker 0: Not Diamond Age.

712
00:44:12,401 --> 00:44:15,814
Speaker 0: Diamond Age has a somewhat different but similar idea.

713
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:18,283
Speaker 1: I'm saying it sounds like somewhere, right?

714
00:44:18,343 --> 00:44:23,642
Speaker 1: Diamond Age, Damon, Ready Player One, all three of those are like that, similarly.

715
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:24,686
Speaker 1: Yeah, similar.

716
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:28,839
Speaker 0: Anyway, but the reality is, Scott's probably going to die.

717
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:32,328
Speaker 1: You're definitely, but not before you.

718
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:34,474
Speaker 0: Not before you do.

719
00:44:35,617 --> 00:44:37,323
Speaker 0: Your last words are going to be, "Rim still

720
00:44:37,363 --> 00:44:37,664
Speaker 0: lives.".

721
00:44:37,785 --> 00:44:38,628
Speaker 0: Rim yet lives.

722
00:44:39,271 --> 00:44:42,023
Speaker 1: It's going to be a John Adams, Thomas Jefferson situation.

723
00:44:42,043 --> 00:44:42,926
Speaker 0: That's what we're going for.

724
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,134
Speaker 0: That's our last goal.

725
00:44:45,174 --> 00:44:46,740
Speaker 1: That's the best possible scenario.

726
00:44:48,461 --> 00:44:50,609
Speaker 1: Do you want me to dance on your grave or pee on it?

727
00:44:51,211 --> 00:44:52,937
Speaker 0: Or drag my butt on it?

728
00:44:53,078 --> 00:44:56,512
Speaker 0: I was going to say I plan to drag my bottom over your grave.

729
00:44:56,853 --> 00:44:59,545
Speaker 1: Well, that's not going to happen because you'll never see my grave.

730
00:44:59,787 --> 00:45:00,530
Speaker 1: Because I won't.

731
00:45:00,591 --> 00:45:01,817
Speaker 1: even if I die, I won't have one.

732
00:45:01,857 --> 00:45:03,023
Speaker 0: Cremation's not an excuse.

733
00:45:03,083 --> 00:45:05,979
Speaker 0: I'll find your ashes, pour them out, and I'm not going to fuck up.

734
00:45:05,999 --> 00:45:07,871
Speaker 1: You're going to drag your butt in the ocean or something?

735
00:45:07,891 --> 00:45:09,300
Speaker 0: I'm not going to fuck up like the big Lebowski.

736
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:11,485
Speaker 1: All right, put him in a volcano.

737
00:45:11,525 --> 00:45:12,851
Speaker 1: That way, drag your butt on that.

738
00:45:14,357 --> 00:45:18,216
Speaker 1: Toss me, go to the tropical island where I want to go and then ashes in the volcano.

739
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:19,301
Speaker 0: So Scott's going to die.

740
00:45:20,525 --> 00:45:21,850
Speaker 1: Rim's going to die.

741
00:45:22,652 --> 00:45:25,462
Speaker 0: I'm glad you finally noticed that I didn't imply that I was going to die.

742
00:45:25,783 --> 00:45:28,654
Speaker 0: Our bits, we put so many bits out on the internet.

743
00:45:29,336 --> 00:45:30,661
Speaker 0: What's going to happen to them?

744
00:45:31,283 --> 00:45:34,895
Speaker 1: Well, a lot of them will stay there for a while, right?

745
00:45:34,915 --> 00:45:35,396
Speaker 1: For a while.

746
00:45:35,416 --> 00:45:41,600
Speaker 1: You know, bits that are like sort of held by a company, it's how long does that company live, right?

747
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,067
Speaker 0: Well, it's over talking about the Internet.

748
00:45:43,087 --> 00:45:43,890
Speaker 0: Let's go crazy here.

749
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:47,565
Speaker 0: So companies are not human, but they.

750
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:53,564
Speaker 0: but they have a sort of agency that is the collective will of all the humans that they had.

751
00:45:53,604 --> 00:45:55,332
Speaker 1: They don't necessarily have to die.

752
00:45:55,392 --> 00:45:57,984
Speaker 1: They are like elves and they will not die of age.

753
00:45:58,004 --> 00:46:01,357
Speaker 1: They will only die of being murdered or killing themselves.

754
00:46:01,478 --> 00:46:06,076
Speaker 0: Do things that are not the will of any one individual running those companies.

755
00:46:06,458 --> 00:46:07,462
Speaker 0: But there's sort of this metal.

756
00:46:07,502 --> 00:46:14,848
Speaker 0: Well, they're basically gods or aggregores, which is kind of fucked up that corporations have become gods.

757
00:46:14,889 --> 00:46:15,711
Speaker 0: Yet we have not.

758
00:46:15,912 --> 00:46:18,118
Speaker 0: Yes, but well, I could be.

759
00:46:18,218 --> 00:46:29,515
Speaker 1: a corporation such as Google can keep my website in its cash or the wayback machine can keep my websites in its cash for ever, as long as those organizations continue to exist.

760
00:46:29,655 --> 00:46:40,315
Speaker 1: And even if all the people working for those organizations die, as long as they hire new people and the organization survives and does not change its mission, that those bits will survive.

761
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:43,185
Speaker 0: But there's one other caveat that's very important.

762
00:46:43,747 --> 00:46:45,192
Speaker 0: if they want to.

763
00:46:45,212 --> 00:46:46,015
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

764
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:48,887
Speaker 1: So but if I'm dead, do I care what they do?

765
00:46:49,008 --> 00:46:51,962
Speaker 0: But I thought you put all your bits out there to make more use appear later.

766
00:46:52,283 --> 00:46:52,886
Speaker 1: I do care.

767
00:46:52,966 --> 00:46:56,178
Speaker 1: But once I'm dead, I don't care anymore because I care now.

768
00:46:56,419 --> 00:46:56,820
Speaker 1: Exactly.

769
00:46:57,140 --> 00:46:57,822
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

770
00:46:58,143 --> 00:47:06,329
Speaker 0: Our society is pretty fucking shit at planning beyond the realm of one or maybe two human lifetime.

771
00:47:06,349 --> 00:47:07,875
Speaker 1: See what it really is, is it's not?

772
00:47:07,975 --> 00:47:11,490
Speaker 1: how much do I care about my bits after I'm dead, I'll be dead.

773
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,544
Speaker 1: It's how much do other people care about my bits when I'm dead?

774
00:47:14,745 --> 00:47:20,307
Speaker 0: It's also how much do you care while you're alive about leaving an impact after you're dead?

775
00:47:20,669 --> 00:47:25,726
Speaker 1: So you'll know dying that you because you're a, you're a vain and egotistical monster.

776
00:47:26,267 --> 00:47:27,992
Speaker 0: How long have you known me?

777
00:47:29,335 --> 00:47:32,683
Speaker 0: So the problem is our society has not dealt with this.

778
00:47:32,944 --> 00:47:41,191
Speaker 0: We, our legal system, our Congress, our laws, our rules, our terms of service do not deal with this at all.

779
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,536
Speaker 1: Some of them do, but very poorly.

780
00:47:42,616 --> 00:47:42,898
Speaker 1: Yes.

781
00:47:43,138 --> 00:47:44,806
Speaker 0: So let's go about through the geek nights.

782
00:47:44,887 --> 00:47:45,871
Speaker 0: use cases of you and me.

783
00:47:45,992 --> 00:47:48,242
Speaker 0: So first off, we both got g mail accounts.

784
00:47:48,483 --> 00:47:48,723
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

785
00:47:49,024 --> 00:47:50,068
Speaker 1: Several of them.

786
00:47:50,329 --> 00:47:50,549
Speaker 1: Yep.

787
00:47:50,770 --> 00:47:51,232
Speaker 1: I only have one.

788
00:47:51,492 --> 00:47:51,713
Speaker 1: Yeah.

789
00:47:52,094 --> 00:47:55,005
Speaker 0: So if I die, who can anyone get access to that?

790
00:47:55,306 --> 00:47:55,909
Speaker 1: Google can.

791
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:56,371
Speaker 0: Yeah.

792
00:47:56,551 --> 00:47:57,877
Speaker 0: So what about my mom?

793
00:47:57,997 --> 00:47:59,546
Speaker 1: I would have to put something in a will.

794
00:47:59,566 --> 00:48:01,336
Speaker 1: Well, your mom, I hope will be dead before you.

795
00:48:01,377 --> 00:48:03,889
Speaker 1: Not that I want your mom to die, but you know, she's older than you.

796
00:48:03,909 --> 00:48:07,283
Speaker 1: You're threatening my mom now, but I'll make them your mom joke.

797
00:48:08,527 --> 00:48:09,310
Speaker 1: Um, right.

798
00:48:09,370 --> 00:48:15,130
Speaker 1: It's you gotta, you put in your will for it to go to somebody and I guess Google have to obey that shit.

799
00:48:16,074 --> 00:48:16,676
Speaker 0: Uh, probably.

800
00:48:16,696 --> 00:48:17,318
Speaker 1: Okay.

801
00:48:17,398 --> 00:48:19,625
Speaker 0: Because you can argue that it's your property.

802
00:48:19,665 --> 00:48:20,609
Speaker 0: You could leave instruction.

803
00:48:20,649 --> 00:48:23,680
Speaker 0: So here is where I want to skip.

804
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:24,684
Speaker 1: Is it your property?

805
00:48:24,704 --> 00:48:27,559
Speaker 0: The usual discussion that happens around the legal business.

806
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:36,590
Speaker 0: Now I want to skip the usual discussion and I want to get right to the uncomfortable hypotheticals and the unpopular opinions that die.

807
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:37,312
Speaker 1: Sad and alone.

808
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,959
Speaker 1: There's no one to leave shit to.

809
00:48:38,979 --> 00:48:39,882
Speaker 0: No one.

810
00:48:39,902 --> 00:48:45,580
Speaker 0: I personally believe that we need to move beyond the idea of the rights of the dead.

811
00:48:47,424 --> 00:48:58,572
Speaker 0: And I Jenna, I think in a ideological pro views from an ideological perspective that once you're dead, your data should be public domain.

812
00:48:58,933 --> 00:49:03,089
Speaker 0: But pragmatically, I recognize that that is problematic for a lot of reasons.

813
00:49:03,290 --> 00:49:04,635
Speaker 1: Well, think about this, right?

814
00:49:05,097 --> 00:49:06,542
Speaker 1: Let's say, right?

815
00:49:06,642 --> 00:49:09,977
Speaker 1: Someone, I have my emails, the emails become public domain.

816
00:49:10,017 --> 00:49:12,309
Speaker 1: I would actually be like, yeah, just publish my emails when I'm dead.

817
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:12,550
Speaker 1: Right.

818
00:49:12,731 --> 00:49:12,912
Speaker 1: Yep.

819
00:49:13,214 --> 00:49:17,169
Speaker 1: But that includes emails sent to me by others who may be yet live.

820
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:22,992
Speaker 0: But at the same time, if you were alive, you're perfectly within your rights to publish them while you're alive.

821
00:49:23,535 --> 00:49:28,138
Speaker 1: Maybe, maybe it's one of those emails from a company that says, don't publish this as private one.

822
00:49:28,178 --> 00:49:29,683
Speaker 0: Do those even hold up in court?

823
00:49:29,703 --> 00:49:31,729
Speaker 0: The answer is no.

824
00:49:32,451 --> 00:49:43,824
Speaker 0: And two, maybe I have a moral, a moral ability unless I signed an NDA to publish anything you give me, because is it a crime for me to relate to you?

825
00:49:43,864 --> 00:49:47,039
Speaker 0: The conversation I had with our friend Scott Johnson regarding your mom.

826
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:50,372
Speaker 1: If it is not a crime though, am I being a Dick?

827
00:49:50,533 --> 00:49:53,525
Speaker 1: Even though I'm dead, given the finger from beyond the grave.

828
00:49:53,605 --> 00:50:00,832
Speaker 0: But could, can you ever say that someone is being a Dick for doing something so simple as simply speaking the truth?

829
00:50:01,555 --> 00:50:04,525
Speaker 0: Are you not a Dick for opposing truth in any situation?

830
00:50:04,926 --> 00:50:07,774
Speaker 1: I approve of saying truth, right?

831
00:50:07,895 --> 00:50:13,530
Speaker 1: But when it upsets people, but most people do not like truth saying as per the Boas' comic.

832
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:33,979
Speaker 0: If uncle Joe dies and suddenly everyone in his family looks at his email and finds out just how many furry porn pay sites he was subscribed to and all his internet girlfriends and how much Viagra he was buying and how much he hated aunt Myrtle and how he cheated with aunt Myrtle on uncle Mark.

833
00:50:36,122 --> 00:50:40,248
Speaker 1: Then that's a great one.

834
00:50:40,289 --> 00:50:41,470
Speaker 1: We need to make a movie out of that.

835
00:50:41,991 --> 00:50:44,155
Speaker 0: I mean, I have chat.

836
00:50:44,255 --> 00:50:47,420
Speaker 0: I am.

837
00:50:47,782 --> 00:50:52,059
Speaker 0: And every online conversation I've ever had since 1996, I have a lot of them.

838
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:58,614
Speaker 1: I don't have, I haven't been quite so diligent as rim and keeping them all, but the first thing I ever said to Scott, a lot of them, and I'll paraphrase.

839
00:50:58,634 --> 00:51:03,635
Speaker 0: They don't have it handy right now is, Hey, it's me, that long haired guy from anime club.

840
00:51:03,655 --> 00:51:04,579
Speaker 0: You want to go to Gracie's?

841
00:51:05,080 --> 00:51:05,260
Speaker 1: Yes.

842
00:51:05,461 --> 00:51:06,944
Speaker 0: And then Scott's like, sure.

843
00:51:07,364 --> 00:51:08,466
Speaker 0: Be there in five.

844
00:51:09,468 --> 00:51:13,155
Speaker 1: Okay.

845
00:51:13,175 --> 00:51:15,861
Speaker 0: So, so what do we do about this?

846
00:51:16,644 --> 00:51:22,745
Speaker 0: That forget the technical standpoint from an ideological standpoint, ideological or practical art.

847
00:51:22,925 --> 00:51:23,909
Speaker 0: What should forget?

848
00:51:24,009 --> 00:51:24,992
Speaker 0: both combine them?

849
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:26,297
Speaker 0: What should we do?

850
00:51:26,698 --> 00:51:32,071
Speaker 0: What should the law say about an email account of someone who died?

851
00:51:32,091 --> 00:51:42,986
Speaker 1: If they did not say anything in their will, then it should belong to the, I guess, are they, is it cloud email or do they host it on a computer?

852
00:51:43,006 --> 00:51:45,460
Speaker 0: They're paying for hosting email because everyone uses Gmail.

853
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:48,595
Speaker 1: These days, I guess Google can just make whatever policy they want.

854
00:51:48,816 --> 00:51:49,660
Speaker 0: So is that moral?

855
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,955
Speaker 0: Should it be considered property that goes to the estates?

856
00:51:53,975 --> 00:51:59,973
Speaker 0: or is it a violation of the dead person's property or, or privacy to give it to the estate?

857
00:52:00,615 --> 00:52:07,259
Speaker 0: If the estate was not directly willed it and there was no prior cause to say the person wanted it to be public.

858
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:11,576
Speaker 0: Well, how about this for person say, I never gave anyone the password and I die.

859
00:52:12,058 --> 00:52:14,505
Speaker 0: Should Google be allowed to give the password to my mom?

860
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:17,793
Speaker 1: If I gave no instructions.

861
00:52:17,833 --> 00:52:18,134
Speaker 0: Yeah.

862
00:52:18,154 --> 00:52:24,076
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, that's the thing is like, is there, what if I didn't want mom to see it?

863
00:52:24,096 --> 00:52:27,150
Speaker 0: or maybe find out about your adult baby diver play?

864
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:27,491
Speaker 1: Right.

865
00:52:27,551 --> 00:52:30,724
Speaker 1: Maybe I really did want mom to see it cause there's a nice message in there.

866
00:52:30,765 --> 00:52:32,150
Speaker 1: Like mom, I miss you.

867
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:32,632
Speaker 1: I'm dead.

868
00:52:33,334 --> 00:52:39,825
Speaker 1: Well, if I send my mom an email from beyond the grave and my, but my account just listened to a pretty good pseudo pot about that.

869
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:40,045
Speaker 1: Yeah.

870
00:52:40,065 --> 00:52:43,860
Speaker 0: Well, it was basically a guy like gets lost driving.

871
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:44,704
Speaker 0: So he calls, I don't know.

872
00:52:44,725 --> 00:52:46,676
Speaker 0: This is when cell phones first got ghost plans.

873
00:52:46,736 --> 00:52:47,038
Speaker 1: All right.

874
00:52:47,058 --> 00:52:48,687
Speaker 1: So he calls his wife.

875
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:49,591
Speaker 0: He's like, yeah, I'm lost.

876
00:52:49,732 --> 00:52:50,435
Speaker 0: Can you come and watch?

877
00:52:50,455 --> 00:52:51,279
Speaker 0: like God, fine.

878
00:52:51,299 --> 00:52:52,044
Speaker 0: I'll come get you.

879
00:52:52,325 --> 00:52:53,592
Speaker 0: Just hang out there talking on the phone.

880
00:52:53,612 --> 00:53:02,988
Speaker 0: And then she comes around the corner and she sees an accident where, and it's his car and he's clearly dead and he's just lost somewhere on the phone.

881
00:53:03,049 --> 00:53:05,342
Speaker 0: And it was, it was actually a pretty well done and creepy story.

882
00:53:05,503 --> 00:53:05,744
Speaker 1: Nice.

883
00:53:05,824 --> 00:53:08,055
Speaker 1: But yeah, I have plans for being a ghost.

884
00:53:08,156 --> 00:53:11,912
Speaker 1: That's why I'm not going to write anything in a will cause I'll just take care of it from the afterlife.

885
00:53:13,137 --> 00:53:19,063
Speaker 1: You know, I'm going to haunt your ass if you're still alive, which you won't be, but you know, I don't know you, but I plan to be a fight King.

886
00:53:19,806 --> 00:53:23,136
Speaker 0: That's pretty sweet.

887
00:53:23,216 --> 00:53:24,440
Speaker 1: I'm going to haunt some motherfuckers.

888
00:53:24,921 --> 00:53:30,008
Speaker 0: You know, it's funny cause you just watched adventure brothers, adventure brothers, adventure time in venture brothers.

889
00:53:30,028 --> 00:53:34,817
Speaker 0: There's a whole bit about ghosts and who they're allowed to haunt and why that I can't reference cause you haven't seen that show.

890
00:53:34,837 --> 00:53:35,743
Speaker 1: I just want to haunt everybody.

891
00:53:36,246 --> 00:53:37,473
Speaker 0: You don't really want to haunt everybody.

892
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:37,915
Speaker 1: Why not?

893
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:41,411
Speaker 0: What if it's like ghost and you're just a hobo on a subway car and it sucks.

894
00:53:41,431 --> 00:53:44,622
Speaker 1: I want to be like, Ooh, I'm like Casper.

895
00:53:44,783 --> 00:53:48,373
Speaker 1: Everyone's afraid even though I'm nice.

896
00:53:48,394 --> 00:53:48,755
Speaker 1: I don't know.

897
00:53:48,875 --> 00:54:10,780
Speaker 0: I'm, I kind of feel like we need some sort of generic societal change such that information that could be retrieved about dead people should be retrieved maybe by the government if there's no instructions otherwise or even if there are and released to the public domain, maybe after an interval.

898
00:54:11,121 --> 00:54:11,322
Speaker 1: Yeah.

899
00:54:11,382 --> 00:54:13,473
Speaker 1: I think you could have an interval of like a generation.

900
00:54:13,493 --> 00:54:13,735
Speaker 1: Yeah.

901
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:14,177
Speaker 0: Like maybe 50 years.

902
00:54:15,041 --> 00:54:22,609
Speaker 0: If you die the 50th year after you die, every piece of digital information that can be found about you is public domain.

903
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:25,061
Speaker 1: All right, now let's talk about a slightly different situation, right?

904
00:54:25,723 --> 00:54:32,303
Speaker 1: Let's say I've got, you know, a bunch of data and I have it hosted on a hosting company like Lino.

905
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:34,649
Speaker 0: Oh, well, you know what?

906
00:54:34,669 --> 00:54:41,069
Speaker 0: There are like 1200 episodes of geek nights on lips and that will disappear there all day.

907
00:54:41,571 --> 00:54:41,932
Speaker 0: What are?

908
00:54:42,173 --> 00:54:43,900
Speaker 0: our credit card runs out, right?

909
00:54:44,221 --> 00:54:47,756
Speaker 1: So the bill might, we still have backups here on a physical hard drive.

910
00:54:47,776 --> 00:54:56,790
Speaker 1: So someone who can collect that hard drive in a will can collect the episodes, but they will not be available on the internet anymore to download.

911
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,886
Speaker 1: If that Libsyn account stops getting paid and I die, it'll stop getting paid.

912
00:55:01,027 --> 00:55:10,184
Speaker 0: Now what I'd like to do because once my bank account is empty, we've got an interesting situation in general that all these web comics and online media never existed before.

913
00:55:10,606 --> 00:55:23,874
Speaker 0: The generation that made them is primarily young, so we haven't run into this yet, but eventually they're going to be comics and TV shows, entire youtube TV shows that the creators just made moderately popular

914
00:55:23,955 --> 00:55:26,164
Speaker 1: ones will stay on youtube as long as youtube lives,

915
00:55:26,345 --> 00:55:30,423
Speaker 0: but will youtube keep an account forever if there's zero activity on it?

916
00:55:30,423 --> 00:55:30,945
Speaker 0: 10 years.

917
00:55:31,226 --> 00:55:32,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, so far they have.

918
00:55:32,651 --> 00:55:34,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, so far they have no poll.

919
00:55:34,458 --> 00:55:38,038
Speaker 1: They don't delete videos and this is a copyright person asked for it to be deleted or something.

920
00:55:38,219 --> 00:55:42,499
Speaker 0: All right, so someone suddenly starts sending copyright notices and there's no one to respond.

921
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:49,565
Speaker 1: Well, let's say somebody puts up MP4 videos just on their website or like on Amazon S3 and they stopped paying the bills.

922
00:55:49,585 --> 00:55:53,405
Speaker 0: Now, I don't think private companies are under any obligation to keep that stuff up.

923
00:55:53,747 --> 00:55:55,254
Speaker 1: They are under none whatsoever.

924
00:55:55,295 --> 00:55:58,753
Speaker 1: In fact, they will just turn it off because you're not paying the bills and they'll delete your shit.

925
00:55:58,794 --> 00:55:59,276
Speaker 0: What do we do?

926
00:55:59,296 --> 00:56:11,163
Speaker 0: Our society is gonna hit this brick wall where people who are about our age are going to be old and have grown up watching TV shows effectively where there's no corporation to keep them alive.

927
00:56:12,027 --> 00:56:14,256
Speaker 0: So suddenly they disappear from the internet forever.

928
00:56:14,657 --> 00:56:21,765
Speaker 1: Well, some cases you have right where you know somebody has a backup somewhere who cares about that thing and keeps it alive, right?

929
00:56:21,826 --> 00:56:29,559
Speaker 1: For example, even things we have today that are old, like really old busted video games from a long time ago, someone downloaded it back in the day.

930
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:41,171
Speaker 1: Someone has the floppies and they put it on the internet and then someone else downloads it and gets a emulator and puts it up on the internet again and keeps, you know, there's so data that it's as long as someone cares, right?

931
00:56:41,251 --> 00:56:47,032
Speaker 1: The people who are alive as long as they care, they fight to keep it available and it's up to them.

932
00:56:47,433 --> 00:56:59,098
Speaker 0: So in that case, we need to update copyright law for it to have found media and sort of orphaned media protections so that people can redistribute stuff when there's no one left to redistribute it.

933
00:56:59,159 --> 00:56:59,299
Speaker 1: Yeah.

934
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,807
Speaker 1: It'd be like a digital museum law.

935
00:57:00,867 --> 00:57:06,313
Speaker 1: Like if you find something old and loss that's digital, you can host it on the internet with your will.

936
00:57:06,333 --> 00:57:07,237
Speaker 1: You know what?

937
00:57:07,337 --> 00:57:07,820
Speaker 1: I mean, you know what?

938
00:57:08,080 --> 00:57:17,000
Speaker 0: Scott did that just fine until we extended it so long that by the time it hits the public domain, it might already be too late, but what about the things that no one cares about?

939
00:57:17,381 --> 00:57:22,460
Speaker 1: But we should still, I believe philosophically keep everything alive even if no one cares.

940
00:57:22,660 --> 00:57:24,712
Speaker 1: You're basically saying only the things people care about.

941
00:57:24,752 --> 00:57:29,332
Speaker 0: So I'm going to propose, here's the other, here's the trans human transcendent.

942
00:57:29,432 --> 00:57:30,195
Speaker 0: Cool idea.

943
00:57:30,456 --> 00:57:31,500
Speaker 0: Forget the government doing it.

944
00:57:31,540 --> 00:57:32,764
Speaker 0: Our government can't do anything.

945
00:57:33,246 --> 00:57:33,487
Speaker 0: Forget.

946
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:41,097
Speaker 0: I think we need, someone needs to found something akin to the modern equivalent of a monastic order of technologists.

947
00:57:41,137 --> 00:57:42,262
Speaker 1: You mean the archive dot org?

948
00:57:42,723 --> 00:58:05,678
Speaker 0: Yes, but it needs to be a little more like foundation, a little more monastic and a little more even maybe dogmatic such that we have this body that is greater than the sum of the people who run it so that it'll run in perpetuity and sort of have an almost religious or almost fanatical devotion to maintaining forgotten data forever.

949
00:58:05,698 --> 00:58:08,892
Speaker 1: There are already a lot of lots and lots of lost data.

950
00:58:08,912 --> 00:58:17,204
Speaker 1: I mean, there are movies that were set on fire entire seasons of doctor who since the library of Alexandria shows that were never recorded.

951
00:58:17,304 --> 00:58:18,329
Speaker 1: Library of Alexandria.

952
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:19,153
Speaker 1: Come on.

953
00:58:19,213 --> 00:58:20,620
Speaker 1: This has been happening for a long time.

954
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:21,643
Speaker 1: Art that was lost.

955
00:58:21,784 --> 00:58:22,085
Speaker 1: Yes.

956
00:58:22,165 --> 00:58:23,831
Speaker 1: Castles blown up by Nazis.

957
00:58:23,871 --> 00:58:27,184
Speaker 1: Castles blown up by the allies that were in Germany.

958
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,916
Speaker 0: So I think there should be in the constitution of the?

959
00:58:29,996 --> 00:58:34,427
Speaker 0: u s at least, you know, our constitution is very clear about the purpose of copyright.

960
00:58:34,808 --> 00:58:40,065
Speaker 0: Its only goal is to promote the creation of useful work progress of science.

961
00:58:40,105 --> 00:58:41,169
Speaker 0: So everything else is just bs.

962
00:58:41,510 --> 00:58:47,253
Speaker 0: Our goal is just as long as people keep making more stuff that that is the goal and everything should serve that goal.

963
00:58:47,875 --> 00:58:58,250
Speaker 0: I think we should add a secondary clause and to maintain the existence of previously created works for the Congress, the power to do something.

964
00:58:58,270 --> 00:59:01,925
Speaker 1: It doesn't give them a mandate to do it, which is what we really needed.

965
00:59:02,467 --> 00:59:03,914
Speaker 0: Well, all right, so forget government.

966
00:59:03,994 --> 00:59:05,663
Speaker 0: We should found a monastic order, right?

967
00:59:05,804 --> 00:59:10,544
Speaker 1: Like archive dot org, but with dogma and that takes care of your arts and things like that.

968
00:59:10,584 --> 00:59:13,757
Speaker 1: But there is more data than just art out there.

969
00:59:13,858 --> 00:59:15,765
Speaker 0: But at the same time, you write a lot of that.

970
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:17,793
Speaker 0: data is just noise, right?

971
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:20,062
Speaker 1: But do you want to save that with my tweets?

972
00:59:20,945 --> 00:59:21,347
Speaker 0: I think so.

973
00:59:21,387 --> 00:59:26,425
Speaker 0: Well, someone needs to because the thing is tweets are and I'm not joking or making light of it.

974
00:59:26,505 --> 00:59:34,776
Speaker 1: Tweets are the modern equivalent of open letters in a lot of my text message history or my voicemails or which I've deleted most of ever.

975
00:59:34,917 --> 00:59:37,705
Speaker 0: All voice may voice mail.

976
00:59:37,725 --> 00:59:40,534
Speaker 0: I'm saying why would you mail voices?

977
00:59:40,554 --> 00:59:41,898
Speaker 1: There's a lot of data.

978
00:59:42,079 --> 00:59:50,569
Speaker 1: I know that is, you know, just out hanging out like what if I use some startups GPS tracker of like a bike route I took one day?

979
00:59:50,589 --> 00:59:51,431
Speaker 1: Do we got to keep that?

980
00:59:51,652 --> 01:00:06,817
Speaker 0: So I'm thinking I might for serious update my will to literally say that upon my death, everything I have ever created over which no one else has joint copyright is public domain.

981
01:00:07,078 --> 01:00:07,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

982
01:00:07,701 --> 01:00:09,188
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about doing something like that.

983
01:00:09,268 --> 01:00:14,271
Speaker 0: See what I'm thinking about doing, but the thing is the problem is even if you think, yes, I'll do that.

984
01:00:15,154 --> 01:00:17,481
Speaker 0: People don't know technology, especially not lawyers.

985
01:00:17,782 --> 01:00:22,356
Speaker 0: So you need to set up a technological means to make that happen.

986
01:00:22,377 --> 01:00:27,878
Speaker 0: You need a USB stick and a physical piece of paper in a safe deposit box with the passwords to ever.

987
01:00:27,938 --> 01:00:42,937
Speaker 1: I was about to say, I thinking about going and getting a safe deposit box and putting in instructions, how to get in all my accounts with a hard drive, like four USB sticks and all of them are encrypted and the password to decrypt them is in my will.

988
01:00:43,179 --> 01:00:43,380
Speaker 1: Right.

989
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:45,551
Speaker 1: And I'm going to put all this stuff in a safe deposit box.

990
01:00:45,692 --> 01:00:48,607
Speaker 1: And there's another reason I'm going to do that besides the practical reason.

991
01:00:48,627 --> 01:00:54,677
Speaker 1: So that if I go to a fancy bank in Manhattan as a real fancy state deposit box, you can go in and use all those services.

992
01:00:54,737 --> 01:01:00,524
Speaker 1: It's going to be like, oh, look at the fancy ass lobby and there's a giant ass safe and I get to go in there like it's a movie.

993
01:01:00,987 --> 01:01:02,674
Speaker 1: Oh, is Ocean's Eleven coming in here soon?

994
01:01:04,220 --> 01:01:05,002
Speaker 1: It'll be fun.

995
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:07,733
Speaker 1: And I'll probably have to pay money for it, but it's not that much.

996
01:01:08,376 --> 01:01:09,038
Speaker 1: How much do they cost?

997
01:01:09,079 --> 01:01:09,982
Speaker 1: I get the tiny one.

998
01:01:10,243 --> 01:01:13,093
Speaker 0: I've never had a safe deposit box.

999
01:01:13,274 --> 01:01:14,036
Speaker 1: I my mama.

1000
01:01:14,056 --> 01:01:15,560
Speaker 1: Well, let me search Manhattan.

1001
01:01:16,202 --> 01:01:19,994
Speaker 0: See, I mean, I when I was a kid, I had a safe.

1002
01:01:20,717 --> 01:01:22,304
Speaker 1: What's the fanciest bank in Manhattan?

1003
01:01:22,525 --> 01:01:22,947
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1004
01:01:22,967 --> 01:01:23,208
Speaker 0: There's.

1005
01:01:23,268 --> 01:01:23,610
Speaker 0: it's probably.

1006
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:26,411
Speaker 0: it's probably something you've never even heard of because only rich people can even use it.

1007
01:01:26,472 --> 01:01:26,974
Speaker 0: It's secret.

1008
01:01:26,994 --> 01:01:28,118
Speaker 1: I'm going to go to.

1009
01:01:28,138 --> 01:01:29,564
Speaker 0: it's not FDIC insured.

1010
01:01:30,046 --> 01:01:31,010
Speaker 1: First Bank of Manhattan.

1011
01:01:31,190 --> 01:01:32,835
Speaker 1: It looks like they would have one anyway.

1012
01:01:33,578 --> 01:01:37,812
Speaker 0: So the moral of all this is there's no good answers.

1013
01:01:38,956 --> 01:01:43,531
Speaker 0: Even at a young age, you should think about what you want to happen to all your data.

1014
01:01:43,651 --> 01:01:55,810
Speaker 0: And if you care and if you care at all, set up some means for your wishes to be fulfilled, but more importantly, set up the technology such that they will be fulfilled.

1015
01:01:57,370 --> 01:02:03,875
Speaker 0: And if you don't know what to do, at least think about what your family or your friends might want to have happen.

1016
01:02:04,136 --> 01:02:09,132
Speaker 0: Because imagine if you die and no one could get access to your email.

1017
01:02:10,076 --> 01:02:11,561
Speaker 0: And they're really sad about that.

1018
01:02:11,923 --> 01:02:15,015
Speaker 0: But at the same time, imagine if they got access to your email.

1019
01:02:15,658 --> 01:02:17,586
Speaker 0: And it's all I've already talked about.

1020
01:02:17,606 --> 01:02:18,349
Speaker 0: different fetishes.

1021
01:02:18,369 --> 01:02:20,139
Speaker 0: trying to think is the worst thing they could find in there.

1022
01:02:20,621 --> 01:02:23,053
Speaker 0: They find out your cat pictures your whole life.

1023
01:02:23,716 --> 01:02:23,937
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1024
01:02:24,017 --> 01:02:24,238
Speaker 1: No.

1025
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:28,596
Speaker 1: What I think you can do is if you're the same philosophy as me of that, you're dead.

1026
01:02:28,737 --> 01:02:30,386
Speaker 1: Who cares what happens after you're dead?

1027
01:02:30,426 --> 01:02:33,704
Speaker 1: That's why I won't buy life insurance for myself because like, what the fuck?

1028
01:02:33,865 --> 01:02:35,332
Speaker 1: You know, I buy life insurance on someone else.

1029
01:02:35,733 --> 01:02:36,235
Speaker 1: Not for me.

1030
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:41,652
Speaker 0: Would you let someone else pay for life insurance on you that pays out to them?

1031
01:02:41,873 --> 01:02:42,174
Speaker 0: Sure.

1032
01:02:42,194 --> 01:02:43,156
Speaker 1: I don't give a fuck.

1033
01:02:43,578 --> 01:02:44,019
Speaker 0: All right.

1034
01:02:44,039 --> 01:02:48,533
Speaker 1: I'm not going to pay my living money for money.

1035
01:02:48,994 --> 01:02:49,416
Speaker 0: All right.

1036
01:02:49,777 --> 01:02:56,100
Speaker 0: So, uh, so me and a thousand listeners are going to get life insurance policies on you as long as you're not guilty of fraud.

1037
01:02:56,161 --> 01:02:57,907
Speaker 1: I got lost saying there's.

1038
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:02,163
Speaker 0: that gives us a pretty high incentive for you to not make it too far.

1039
01:03:02,244 --> 01:03:02,826
Speaker 0: It's fine.

1040
01:03:03,127 --> 01:03:03,589
Speaker 1: It's fine.

1041
01:03:03,669 --> 01:03:07,363
Speaker 1: I was protecting me, but you're dead when you can't spend your life insurance from jail.

1042
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:13,877
Speaker 1: You don't think the detectives, the first thing he's going to do in the murder case is look and see who has life insurance on me.

1043
01:03:13,977 --> 01:03:14,178
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

1044
01:03:14,218 --> 01:03:14,781
Speaker 0: And you know what?

1045
01:03:15,203 --> 01:03:17,193
Speaker 0: Uh, you eventually get some, you have.

1046
01:03:17,534 --> 01:03:20,326
Speaker 0: thousands of people have licensed life insurance policies on you.

1047
01:03:20,346 --> 01:03:22,738
Speaker 0: Eventually one of them is just fucking crazy.

1048
01:03:22,758 --> 01:03:24,286
Speaker 1: Oh, you think you're open?

1049
01:03:24,306 --> 01:03:25,010
Speaker 1: The other guy will do it.

1050
01:03:25,110 --> 01:03:26,057
Speaker 0: I didn't, I'm not going to do it.

1051
01:03:26,077 --> 01:03:26,722
Speaker 0: I'm not going to pay out.

1052
01:03:26,742 --> 01:03:29,017
Speaker 1: It's going to be low when the numbers get too big anyway.

1053
01:03:29,097 --> 01:03:32,213
Speaker 0: No, because I have one of the first, I've had like a million dollar policy.

1054
01:03:33,757 --> 01:03:42,877
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is that, you know, if you believe that you should worry about the people who are alive and what the people who are dead think doesn't matter because they're fucking dead, right?

1055
01:03:42,917 --> 01:03:50,005
Speaker 1: Then if you're concerned about your things and your data after you're dead, ask the people who are still alive what they want.

1056
01:03:50,286 --> 01:03:58,127
Speaker 1: And then because of laws require you to put in a will, just put whatever they want in the will, the people you care about so that they get what they want because you're dead.

1057
01:03:58,147 --> 01:03:58,951
Speaker 1: What the fuck do you care?

1058
01:03:58,992 --> 01:03:59,353
Speaker 0: what you want?

1059
01:03:59,373 --> 01:04:04,315
Speaker 0: Make sure you enable the technology, store the password, set up a way for it to actually happen.

1060
01:04:04,677 --> 01:04:05,420
Speaker 0: Otherwise it won't.

1061
01:04:06,203 --> 01:04:11,483
Speaker 0: Don't trust the companies that have the data like Facebook to follow the instructions of the will.

1062
01:04:11,785 --> 01:04:13,812
Speaker 0: Make sure the password's in the will somewhere.

1063
01:04:14,575 --> 01:04:21,115
Speaker 0: And if you want to commit awesome crimes 20 years from now, be a lawyer and be the one who takes everybody's wills.

1064
01:04:27,146 --> 01:04:29,290
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott.
