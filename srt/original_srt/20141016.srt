1
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:09,257
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, October 16th, 2014.

2
00:00:09,257 --> 00:00:09,639
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,652 --> 00:00:14,169
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:15,958
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,978 --> 00:00:18,290
Speaker 1: Tonight, we're talking about sunglasses.

6
00:00:20,512 --> 00:00:22,259
Speaker 0: This is 106 miles to Chicago.

7
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,170
Speaker 1: We got a full tank of gas, half a pack of cigarettes.

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,844
Speaker 1: It's dark, and we're wearing sunglasses.

9
00:00:28,348 --> 00:00:28,589
Speaker 1: Hit it.

10
00:00:30,593 --> 00:00:31,568
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

11
00:00:32,334 --> 00:00:33,148
Speaker 1: I learned something today.

12
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:37,457
Speaker 1: I- I- It took you a while- -that you could learn.

13
00:00:37,497 --> 00:00:38,730
Speaker 0: You didn't know everything already.

14
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there's a thing.

15
00:00:39,697 --> 00:00:51,190
Speaker 1: I- So I- When it comes to e-cigarettes, while I would not use e-cigarettes for all the obvious reasons, they bother me a lot less than regular cigarettes because they don't smell like shit.

16
00:00:51,653 --> 00:00:52,150
Speaker 0: That's true.

17
00:00:52,511 --> 00:00:58,870
Speaker 1: That is the primary reason why I will put up with people smoking their e-cigarettes at cons and things because I just don't care if you don't smell bad.

18
00:00:59,110 --> 00:00:59,230
Speaker 1: Yep.

19
00:00:59,611 --> 00:01:14,490
Speaker 1: So, I've realized that if someone smokes e-cigarettes in an area long enough, I think it takes a couple months, a smell builds up from the residue in the area similar to cigarettes.

20
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:15,081
Speaker 1: But it doesn't-.

21
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:16,167
Speaker 0: How did you learn this?

22
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:19,070
Speaker 1: Because, at my work, someone smokes an e-cigarette.

23
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:20,090
Speaker 0: In the office?

24
00:01:20,512 --> 00:01:22,509
Speaker 1: That's really common in my industry now.

25
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:22,973
Speaker 1: Whoa.

26
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:23,679
Speaker 1: Yeah.

27
00:01:24,673 --> 00:01:32,290
Speaker 1: In fact, a lot of people I can see who had quit smoking started again because they can smoke e-cigarettes in buildings and no one cares.

28
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:44,189
Speaker 0: The policy that I've seen is that even though, at least ostensibly, I originally believed it was water vapor, but now I've seen some things suggest it's not always just water vapor that comes out- Well, it's propylene glycol and a bunch of other stuff.

29
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:44,591
Speaker 0: Right.

30
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:47,269
Speaker 0: That it's not entirely just water vapor coming out the other end.

31
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:52,750
Speaker 0: That even so, it's still only permitted in areas where regular smoking is permitted.

32
00:01:53,212 --> 00:02:01,086
Speaker 0: If someone was trying to do that at my work, no one does, I would talk to HR and they would probably be like, "Yeah, you can only smoke that where people can

33
00:02:01,106 --> 00:02:01,388
Speaker 0: smoke.".

34
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:02,495
Speaker 0: I

35
00:02:02,515 --> 00:02:17,728
Speaker 1: don't care because our office is huge and I'm kind of segregated from everyone, but based on my life for the past few months, both between this and just going to other offices and things, I noticed a smell that I'd never smelled before and I noticed it in a few places for months.

36
00:02:20,371 --> 00:02:29,150
Speaker 1: I'd narrowed it down over time and I eventually figured out I can identify the smell of someone in this area regularly smokes e-cigarettes.

37
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:33,330
Speaker 1: It's a really distinct smell and I can't describe it very well.

38
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:47,910
Speaker 1: It reminds me vaguely of, not the markers that kids would sniff to get high in the old days, but there was this one brand of, it wasn't Crayola, it was some knockoff brand, and they made markers that had really nice fine points that were really durable.

39
00:02:48,793 --> 00:02:58,310
Speaker 1: I just remember that the brown one of that marker had such a distinctive smell that it is burned into my adult brain by way of kid brain.

40
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:05,729
Speaker 0: The number one smell that is burned into my adult brain by way of kid brain is the smell of the Masters of the Universe Mossman figurine.

41
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:10,708
Speaker 0: There's a lot of times in my life where I've been like, "Smells like

42
00:03:10,728 --> 00:03:10,970
Speaker 0: Mossman."

43
00:03:13,492 --> 00:03:18,050
Speaker 0: And everyone who knows Mossman knows what Mossman smells like.

44
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:29,649
Speaker 1: My number one from that era is actually the smell of the insides of those little WWF wrestling toys, the plastic guys that had actions.

45
00:03:30,733 --> 00:03:31,530
Speaker 0: Those are good toys.

46
00:03:31,970 --> 00:03:33,150
Speaker 1: But they had a particular smell.

47
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:34,610
Speaker 0: They didn't make good toys like that anymore.

48
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,419
Speaker 1: Yeah, those were really good toys actually.

49
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:38,550
Speaker 1: I would play with those a little bit again if they were laying around.

50
00:03:38,690 --> 00:03:39,528
Speaker 0: There's no reason not to.

51
00:03:40,093 --> 00:03:40,798
Speaker 0: There's some in my house.

52
00:03:40,818 --> 00:03:42,530
Speaker 0: You want to go to my parents' house, play with them?

53
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:49,610
Speaker 1: And the smell of that brown fucking marker and the residue of e-cigarettes reminds my brain of that brown marker.

54
00:03:49,918 --> 00:03:50,150
Speaker 0: Okay.

55
00:03:51,010 --> 00:04:01,930
Speaker 1: Independently, in my building, there's been a problem for a long time of a bunch of people, all of whom are wide-bodied, shall we say, like to smoke in the stairwells illegally.

56
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:02,950
Speaker 0: To avoid going outside?

57
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:03,365
Speaker 1: Yes.

58
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:08,390
Speaker 0: In my building, people go outside, and in fact, they have now pushed them away from the doorway.

59
00:04:08,431 --> 00:04:09,710
Speaker 0: They have to go to the edge of the sidewalk.

60
00:04:09,890 --> 00:04:10,112
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

61
00:04:10,132 --> 00:04:11,301
Speaker 1: My building has put all these signs.

62
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:16,630
Speaker 1: They've actually tried to get people to stay away from the building, and most of the buildings nearby have done that.

63
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:20,908
Speaker 1: But these guys, it's not like these people are on the 30th floor smoking.

64
00:04:22,211 --> 00:04:25,650
Speaker 1: While that's annoying, I can at least understand why they would do that.

65
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,230
Speaker 0: At least a roof deck or the fire escape.

66
00:04:29,350 --> 00:04:34,310
Speaker 1: But the people who are smoking the most are all on the third floor.

67
00:04:35,255 --> 00:04:36,349
Speaker 1: They could just walk down.

68
00:04:36,753 --> 00:04:38,770
Speaker 0: Listen, smoker is not a protective class.

69
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:42,370
Speaker 0: If I was a boss of a company, I would just fire everyone who smoked.

70
00:04:42,772 --> 00:04:44,569
Speaker 0: I don't care how good they are at their job.

71
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:49,145
Speaker 1: The only reason I complained to the building, the super- Oh, as opposed to your HR?

72
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, because the HR, they complained.

73
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,808
Speaker 0: Oh, it's people who aren't in your company.

74
00:04:53,011 --> 00:04:54,129
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it's not what it works for us.

75
00:04:54,933 --> 00:04:57,150
Speaker 1: We're on the 16th floor of a giant fucking building.

76
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:59,030
Speaker 0: Okay, it's other people in the building.

77
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:07,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I complained, and we complained primarily because that stairwell was full of a sea of cigarette butts.

78
00:05:09,015 --> 00:05:10,450
Speaker 0: And the janitor was not cleaning it up?

79
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:11,420
Speaker 1: No one was dealing with it.

80
00:05:11,461 --> 00:05:12,310
Speaker 1: No one seemed to care.

81
00:05:12,891 --> 00:05:16,029
Speaker 1: So one day, I was walking down- And you saw the person.

82
00:05:16,534 --> 00:05:17,610
Speaker 1: I wear Google Glass every day.

83
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,230
Speaker 0: The guilty party.

84
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,622
Speaker 1: And I saw the people, and I was like,

85
00:05:19,743 --> 00:05:19,966
Speaker 1: "Huh.".

86
00:05:20,551 --> 00:05:23,427
Speaker 1: So I just kind of tapped, and I just recorded videos.

87
00:05:23,467 --> 00:05:23,869
Speaker 1: I walked by.

88
00:05:24,595 --> 00:05:25,709
Speaker 1: And I did this a few times.

89
00:05:26,533 --> 00:05:37,069
Speaker 1: And then later, I did this whole thing, because as I was just giving advice to one of our friends, if you're going to antagonize certain kinds of people, it is best to ensure that they don't know who you are.

90
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:47,189
Speaker 1: So I then, when no one was in the stairwells, took my Google Glass with this nice wide angle, and I held it up really high and took a bunch of pictures.

91
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:53,570
Speaker 1: And then I printed posters in the office printer that said- The paths of aggressive paths.

92
00:05:53,691 --> 00:05:55,704
Speaker 1: Yes, but they didn't say, "Don't smoke in the

93
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:56,429
Speaker 1: whatevers.".

94
00:05:56,771 --> 00:06:00,506
Speaker 1: They said, "Security cameras are in these areas.

95
00:06:00,566 --> 00:06:01,269
Speaker 1: Be where you are on

96
00:06:01,309 --> 00:06:01,490
Speaker 1: film."

97
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,769
Speaker 1: With little pictures of the angles.

98
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,930
Speaker 1: And because the ceiling's kind of dark and weird and dank and cables, it wouldn't be super obvious.

99
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:17,950
Speaker 1: And I figured that the people who smoke and do these kinds of people, and I put them on the door specifically, so they wouldn't see it when they came in to smoke.

100
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,910
Speaker 1: They'd finish their cigarette, they'd turn around to leave, and then they'd see the sign.

101
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:26,850
Speaker 1: And at that point, they probably don't want to be looking around up at the cameras.

102
00:06:29,414 --> 00:06:31,930
Speaker 1: And it seemed to work, because suddenly a lot of the people stopped smoking.

103
00:06:32,511 --> 00:06:35,289
Speaker 1: But one day I was going down, and there were these two guys.

104
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,930
Speaker 1: And they were still smoking.

105
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:37,909
Speaker 0: What kind of guys are these?

106
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:44,170
Speaker 1: Big, fat guys wearing ill-fitting, regular business casual stuff.

107
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:45,725
Speaker 1: Like office people.

108
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:47,290
Speaker 1: No tie, though.

109
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:52,050
Speaker 1: I don't think they work finance, I think they just work regular office jobs.

110
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:55,669
Speaker 0: Not in finance, they don't have a tie.

111
00:06:56,931 --> 00:07:03,569
Speaker 1: People in finance either seem to wear clothes that are tailored or fit well, or they're ill-fitting, but they're wearing a tie.

112
00:07:05,152 --> 00:07:06,528
Speaker 1: So I got pictures of them.

113
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:16,010
Speaker 1: And then I replaced the previous posters with posters that had the pictures of them, because I got it from a really high angle, because I came down the stairs.

114
00:07:16,511 --> 00:07:19,046
Speaker 1: And it was like, "No smoking in the building, violators will be

115
00:07:19,086 --> 00:07:19,629
Speaker 1: prosecuted.".

116
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:26,110
Speaker 1: So the janitors, about a week after I did that, cleaned up all the cigarette butts.

117
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,150
Speaker 1: There are now zero cigarette butts, and that has been the case for months.

118
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:37,350
Speaker 1: So I claim victory by scaring some fat people into not smoking and leaving cigarette butts in the stairwell.

119
00:07:37,831 --> 00:07:39,823
Speaker 1: And the posters are still there, so the building...

120
00:07:41,051 --> 00:07:42,550
Speaker 0: So the building supports your assignage?

121
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,990
Speaker 1: The building tacitly approved of my tactics.

122
00:07:46,536 --> 00:07:47,349
Speaker 1: That is my story.

123
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:48,787
Speaker 0: Great story.

124
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:50,850
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, it's The Lounge.

125
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:51,486
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

126
00:07:52,570 --> 00:07:54,709
Speaker 1: So what are you going to talk about tonight on The Lounge?

127
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:57,242
Speaker 0: I'm not, but I do have a complaint about some news.

128
00:07:57,322 --> 00:07:58,810
Speaker 0: that's probably Monday news, but whatever.

129
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:03,590
Speaker 0: So Apple announced today a bunch of, you know, iPad, whatever, no one cares.

130
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:06,230
Speaker 0: There's no difference between the new iPad and the one I have already.

131
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,810
Speaker 1: I care in the sense that I'm probably going to buy an iPad, so I might as well just get the new one.

132
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:11,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course.

133
00:08:12,292 --> 00:08:14,950
Speaker 0: I don't understand why they're still selling the non-retina iPad mini.

134
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:15,909
Speaker 0: Who is going to buy that?

135
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,748
Speaker 1: I would buy it if it was like... I guess it's cheap.

136
00:08:18,153 --> 00:08:20,410
Speaker 1: If it was half price, I would consider it.

137
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:21,604
Speaker 0: Do they still sell the iPod touch?

138
00:08:21,786 --> 00:08:22,049
Speaker 0: Why?

139
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:27,770
Speaker 0: Why would you get the iPod touch when you could get the iPad mini, not retina, for cheap?

140
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:29,614
Speaker 0: Why even have that?

141
00:08:29,675 --> 00:08:36,750
Speaker 0: The lowest end iPad should be the one I have, which is now called... Which used to be called iPad mini with retina and is now called iPad mini 2.

142
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,370
Speaker 1: When we bought...

143
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:38,809
Speaker 0: That should be the lowest one that they have.

144
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:41,969
Speaker 1: When we bought that Mac that we eventually used...

145
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,169
Speaker 0: That was the highest end one.

146
00:08:43,351 --> 00:08:44,761
Speaker 1: No, it was not, in fact.

147
00:08:44,821 --> 00:08:45,950
Speaker 1: It was the lowest end one.

148
00:08:46,656 --> 00:08:48,189
Speaker 0: Well, first of all, that's a PC.

149
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,229
Speaker 1: We bought the Core Solo.

150
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:51,382
Speaker 0: Yes, but it...

151
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,430
Speaker 1: It had one Core.

152
00:08:53,590 --> 00:08:56,421
Speaker 0: Right, but it was still the newest model, right?

153
00:08:56,481 --> 00:08:58,790
Speaker 0: It was just the lowest configuration of the model.

154
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:06,170
Speaker 1: Wow, I just remembered that in that era, the Core 2 Duo was a big deal because Daddy 2 Cores was not a common thing in consumer PCs.

155
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:15,070
Speaker 0: There's also a new Mac mini, so if you are someone who wants an HDVC, that is the number one recommended editor's choice at Geek Nights Incorporated magazine.

156
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:17,489
Speaker 1: Unless you want to play games on your TV.

157
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,713
Speaker 0: That is not correct.

158
00:09:19,516 --> 00:09:23,730
Speaker 0: It would have been correct, but a few months ago, however, there has been a development.

159
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:24,630
Speaker 1: Oh, the Steam stream?

160
00:09:24,872 --> 00:09:25,549
Speaker 0: The Steam stream.

161
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:28,970
Speaker 1: Can you stream a Windows game to a Mac Steam?

162
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,525
Speaker 0: Not only can you do that...

163
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:32,230
Speaker 1: I did not know you could do that.

164
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:34,684
Speaker 0: You can stream it to a fucking Linux machine.

165
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:35,670
Speaker 0: It doesn't give a shit.

166
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:46,520
Speaker 0: So the way this works... Obviously, this won't help you too much with, say, emulated games, but any game that's in Steam that you want to play... So you have your real desktop PC somewhere else in the house.

167
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,747
Speaker 0: Obviously, you have one of those, right?

168
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:49,369
Speaker 0: Yes, you do.

169
00:09:49,794 --> 00:09:50,469
Speaker 0: Because you're a nerd.

170
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:56,210
Speaker 0: You have your mad, powerful desktop PC with your Nvidia 770 or so, whatever's in there, right?

171
00:09:56,973 --> 00:09:58,610
Speaker 0: On there, you've got all your games installed.

172
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:02,630
Speaker 0: All your games that need that 770 or GPU or whatever to play are on that computer.

173
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:07,910
Speaker 0: You have that computer on a LAN alongside your HDPC, which is on the same LAN.

174
00:10:08,570 --> 00:10:12,310
Speaker 0: You go to your HDPC, which is a measly Mac mini with no GPU to speak of.

175
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:15,829
Speaker 0: However, that measly Mac mini does have a network connection that's fast.

176
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:18,109
Speaker 0: Either wired, ethernet, or Wi-Fi.

177
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,870
Speaker 1: It's got a RAM and a processor.

178
00:10:20,251 --> 00:10:23,990
Speaker 0: And it is capable of playing 1080p video, which is all you can watch on your TV anyway.

179
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,570
Speaker 0: That Mac mini, you go on that Mac mini, you open up Steam.

180
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:32,830
Speaker 0: And in the Steam list, it will be all those games that are on your desktop PC.

181
00:10:33,312 --> 00:10:35,726
Speaker 0: All of them from the low-end ones to the high-end ones.

182
00:10:35,746 --> 00:10:36,310
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

183
00:10:36,912 --> 00:10:42,310
Speaker 0: And if you try to play one of them, that game will actually open up on your desktop PC where Steam is running.

184
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:44,770
Speaker 0: And you can actually go over to your desktop PC and look at it running.

185
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:47,565
Speaker 0: But, it is running in a 1080p window.

186
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:58,570
Speaker 0: And Steam is capturing every pixel in that 1080p window, encoding it to video, and streaming it over the network to your Mac mini, Linux computer, or other Windows PC.

187
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:06,650
Speaker 1: I think what this means for me is that the GTX 460 small form factor video card I got in the HDPC will be the last video card I ever buy over there.

188
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,278
Speaker 0: That is correct.

189
00:11:07,521 --> 00:11:08,170
Speaker 0: For me as well.

190
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:16,350
Speaker 0: There is an amount of lag that would be unsuitable for an incredible real-time competitive game, such as a competitive Starcraft 2 or Street Fighter.

191
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:21,930
Speaker 0: But I was playing Resident Evil, you know, newish, Resident Evil 6, I think.

192
00:11:22,293 --> 00:11:23,930
Speaker 0: And it was not a fucking problem.

193
00:11:24,190 --> 00:11:24,553
Speaker 1: You know what?

194
00:11:24,795 --> 00:11:26,770
Speaker 1: I will test it with Mark of the Ninja.

195
00:11:27,030 --> 00:11:30,690
Speaker 1: Because that game is a simple 2D platform, but it required some precision movement.

196
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:39,390
Speaker 0: The number one reason I love the Steam stream feature is that you can get Steam running on your HDPC and your desktop without having to constantly log in and log out of both of them.

197
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,129
Speaker 0: They now let you log in both places at once.

198
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:50,090
Speaker 0: So, the Mac mini editor's choice at Geek Nights for best HDPC once again, and probably for a long time, as long as Steam stream exists.

199
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,169
Speaker 0: However, there is something else that upset me.

200
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:59,828
Speaker 0: The other actual announcement that matters from Apple today is they got a new iMac, which is just an iMac, just like all the other iMacs.

201
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,730
Speaker 0: Except the screen is a ridiculous resolution.

202
00:12:04,031 --> 00:12:04,654
Speaker 0: It's 27-inch.

203
00:12:04,715 --> 00:12:07,430
Speaker 0: I prefer 24, but 27 is tolerably large.

204
00:12:08,531 --> 00:12:11,747
Speaker 0: But, this motherfucker is not 1080p.

205
00:12:13,152 --> 00:12:15,047
Speaker 0: It's not Ultra HD 4K.

206
00:12:15,972 --> 00:12:16,803
Speaker 0: It's not Cinema 4K.

207
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:18,738
Speaker 0: This motherfucker is 5K.

208
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,513
Speaker 1: Daddy 5.

209
00:12:21,513 --> 00:12:21,882
Speaker 0: Daddy 5Ks.

210
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:30,790
Speaker 0: This is the king of all monitors, and you can only get this monitor attached to a Macintosh computer.

211
00:12:31,093 --> 00:12:31,588
Speaker 1: The fuck?

212
00:12:32,971 --> 00:12:33,658
Speaker 0: For $2,500, which is not bad.

213
00:12:35,070 --> 00:12:38,371
Speaker 0: I would pay $2,000 just for the monitor if I had $2,000.

214
00:12:38,371 --> 00:12:40,762
Speaker 1: As would I. I would not do that right now.

215
00:12:40,782 --> 00:12:41,510
Speaker 1: A lot of travel.

216
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,828
Speaker 0: No, I don't have any money right now.

217
00:12:44,156 --> 00:12:46,830
Speaker 1: Even I am at the limit of my spending right now.

218
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:51,490
Speaker 0: If I had money and I could mount the monitor on an arm, which you usually can't do with Apple monitors.

219
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:54,990
Speaker 1: If I'm spending $2,000 on a monitor, at that point, I'm buying an arm.

220
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I have arms already.

221
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:58,370
Speaker 1: Well, I would get one of the big ol' arms.

222
00:12:58,630 --> 00:12:59,438
Speaker 0: I have big ol' arms.

223
00:13:00,348 --> 00:13:00,590
Speaker 0: Anyway.

224
00:13:01,131 --> 00:13:01,990
Speaker 1: I would get bigger than what you got.

225
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:04,339
Speaker 0: Motherfuckers, it's not so much about Apple.

226
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,910
Speaker 0: Why are you making this monitor attached to the iMac?

227
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:11,242
Speaker 0: It's, "Hey, Dell, Samsung, everyone else in the universe.

228
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:13,769
Speaker 0: How come you don't have a fucking 5K monitor like

229
00:13:13,829 --> 00:13:14,010
Speaker 0: that?".

230
00:13:14,092 --> 00:13:14,728
Speaker 1: I can tell you why.

231
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:15,973
Speaker 0: Why can't you do that?

232
00:13:15,993 --> 00:13:18,042
Speaker 0: I mean, Dell has one that's in the works.

233
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:19,970
Speaker 0: It's like two monitors stuck together.

234
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,870
Speaker 0: It's like, that's garbage.

235
00:13:20,991 --> 00:13:23,910
Speaker 1: Well, this one is probably effectively two monitors stuck together.

236
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:24,858
Speaker 0: Apple doesn't even make this monitor.

237
00:13:24,878 --> 00:13:26,090
Speaker 0: This monitor is made in someone else's factory.

238
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:31,630
Speaker 0: And the piece that's the display, the important part, is not made by Apple.

239
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:35,310
Speaker 0: It's made in a factory by someone else and bought by Apple with a contract.

240
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,295
Speaker 1: I didn't read the specs.

241
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:38,990
Speaker 1: I suspect this is actually two monitors stuck together.

242
00:13:39,371 --> 00:13:41,347
Speaker 0: You think the iMac is two monitors stuck together?

243
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:41,650
Speaker 0: I don't.

244
00:13:42,131 --> 00:13:43,805
Speaker 1: Well, it won't appear that way to the users.

245
00:13:43,846 --> 00:13:44,350
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

246
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,710
Speaker 0: You think it's that flawless that you can't tell?

247
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:47,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll bet you can't tell.

248
00:13:48,592 --> 00:13:50,529
Speaker 0: If that's true, then I don't even want it.

249
00:13:50,874 --> 00:13:52,029
Speaker 0: Who wants two monitors stuck together?

250
00:13:52,390 --> 00:13:53,336
Speaker 1: Because you wouldn't be able to tell.

251
00:13:53,497 --> 00:13:55,227
Speaker 1: How would it act like one?

252
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:55,750
Speaker 1: What do you care?

253
00:13:57,051 --> 00:14:05,770
Speaker 1: With existing specs, depending on how they wired it up, as we were talking about on Twitter, everything short of the newest version of DisplayPort can't handle that resolution.

254
00:14:07,992 --> 00:14:11,810
Speaker 0: Apple literally invented Mini DisplayPort, and they fucking love DisplayPort.

255
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:13,059
Speaker 0: What do you think's inside the iMac?

256
00:14:13,119 --> 00:14:14,469
Speaker 0: A very tiny DisplayPort cable.

257
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:17,101
Speaker 0: People think, "Oh, it's internal.

258
00:14:17,181 --> 00:14:18,127
Speaker 0: Everything is on one

259
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:18,509
Speaker 0: board.".

260
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:19,353
Speaker 0: It's like, no.

261
00:14:19,735 --> 00:14:23,290
Speaker 0: Even inside your iPad, there's pieces, just like there are on a laptop.

262
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:33,970
Speaker 1: The problem is, as Conrad pointed out to me when I was talking about this way back, is that Adobe software, and in general, Windows, can't work on high-resolution displays.

263
00:14:34,231 --> 00:14:34,401
Speaker 0: Why not?

264
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,590
Speaker 1: If you have a super high DPI...

265
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:37,369
Speaker 0: If you have a good enough video card, you should push it.

266
00:14:37,831 --> 00:14:47,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but UI elements, because of the way shitty software is written and the way Windows does its renderer, you can't see them, and you can't scale them most of the time.

267
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:50,509
Speaker 1: And the only scaling you have, basically...

268
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:52,548
Speaker 0: Is the magnifier, which will basically throw...

269
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:54,370
Speaker 1: Literally removes the point of having the good monitor.

270
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:57,508
Speaker 0: It'll just make the same pixels four pixels larger, and then you...

271
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:03,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, and Adobe seems to say that they can't do anything until Microsoft makes a change.

272
00:15:04,111 --> 00:15:05,389
Speaker 0: I'm sure Windows 10 is going to do it.

273
00:15:05,592 --> 00:15:05,857
Speaker 1: We'll see.

274
00:15:06,123 --> 00:15:06,510
Speaker 1: We'll see.

275
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:13,050
Speaker 1: The problem seems to also exist with a bunch of software on Macs, but not as badly as it does on Windows.

276
00:15:14,351 --> 00:15:19,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is pissing me off, because I really need some kind of retina display on my computers.

277
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,710
Speaker 0: And the number one reason, actually, to get retina display on your computer is to develop apps for iOS.

278
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:28,390
Speaker 0: You want to make an iOS, like an iPad app, on retina resolution?

279
00:15:28,950 --> 00:15:33,090
Speaker 0: Too bad that iPad has more pixels than your monitor, unless you have this new iMac.

280
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:39,609
Speaker 1: I just want it, because even my giant monitor now... I need more pixels, because there's a lot of shit I want to be displaying while I'm working on shit.

281
00:15:40,171 --> 00:15:42,721
Speaker 0: Even if I just take a photo, this photo's like 4,000-something.

282
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,988
Speaker 0: I could actually see the whole photo all at once on that fucking monitor, if I could get it.

283
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:49,439
Speaker 1: Yep.

284
00:15:50,490 --> 00:15:51,736
Speaker 0: Almost, yeah.

285
00:15:51,856 --> 00:15:54,106
Speaker 0: Maybe not the whole photo all at once, but a lot of it.

286
00:15:54,689 --> 00:15:54,910
Speaker 0: Enough.

287
00:15:55,770 --> 00:16:00,649
Speaker 0: As opposed to if I want to see each pixel in the photo being one pixel on the screen, having the same way in.

288
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:04,930
Speaker 1: So, I got one other funny news, because I find this funny.

289
00:16:05,291 --> 00:16:09,745
Speaker 1: So, you shit should all vote, so go vote.

290
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:11,330
Speaker 1: Voting's going to happen kind of soon.

291
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:11,679
Speaker 0: Soon.

292
00:16:12,231 --> 00:16:13,826
Speaker 1: And this is the election that no one votes in.

293
00:16:15,470 --> 00:16:17,090
Speaker 0: Who's there even to vote for in New York?

294
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:17,819
Speaker 1: In New York?

295
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,369
Speaker 1: I don't know.

296
00:16:19,551 --> 00:16:21,178
Speaker 1: Well, actually, you know what New York's got?

297
00:16:21,259 --> 00:16:22,183
Speaker 1: The vote already happened.

298
00:16:22,203 --> 00:16:23,790
Speaker 1: The primary is literally all that matters.

299
00:16:23,891 --> 00:16:24,368
Speaker 0: Yes, we know.

300
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:29,590
Speaker 1: So, in Florida, it actually does matter, because it's kind of neck and neck.

301
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:36,690
Speaker 1: They have a shit-tier Republican governor, and a poop-tier Democrat is running against him.

302
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:40,573
Speaker 1: And I don't want to get into the politics of all that, but- Really?

303
00:16:40,593 --> 00:16:41,450
Speaker 0: This isn't about politics?

304
00:16:41,591 --> 00:16:43,070
Speaker 1: They had a debate.

305
00:16:43,858 --> 00:16:44,170
Speaker 1: Okay.

306
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:54,930
Speaker 1: And the debate would have been ignored, like all midterm debates are, but for the fact that one of these assholes did the thing that I often do.

307
00:16:56,532 --> 00:16:59,210
Speaker 0: Wouldn't that make him not an asshole, or it would make you an asshole?

308
00:16:59,490 --> 00:16:59,997
Speaker 1: Yodie-o.

309
00:17:00,402 --> 00:17:00,909
Speaker 1: Yodie-o.

310
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:08,630
Speaker 1: So, basically, debates have these crazy sets of rules, like can't ask about this, can't ask about that, no teleprompters, whatever.

311
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,184
Speaker 0: I would only agree to a debate if I was a politician with no rules whatsoever.

312
00:17:12,365 --> 00:17:13,550
Speaker 0: Say whatever the fuck you want.

313
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:15,459
Speaker 1: No rules whatsoever, just stab motherfucker.

314
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:17,107
Speaker 1: Be like, "Well, I guess I'm

315
00:17:17,146 --> 00:17:17,690
Speaker 1: uncontested.".

316
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:19,048
Speaker 0: Other than the laws of the land.

317
00:17:21,152 --> 00:17:23,770
Speaker 1: No rules, on a barge, international waters.

318
00:17:23,931 --> 00:17:25,749
Speaker 0: Dude, I'll do a political debate in a barge.

319
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:27,888
Speaker 1: Two governors enter, one governor leave.

320
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:32,481
Speaker 0: So, anyway, our goobener has- I go to the polls, corpse.

321
00:17:32,945 --> 00:17:33,529
Speaker 0: One vote corpse.

322
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:43,110
Speaker 1: So, basically, what happened was one of those rules said no electronic devices on the stage.

323
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:44,172
Speaker 0: You know what?

324
00:17:44,613 --> 00:17:52,706
Speaker 0: While I just said I would like a debate with no rules, you know, it's not a bad idea in a debate to be like, "Alright, you can't have your iPad and your iPhones look shit up during the

325
00:17:52,727 --> 00:17:53,028
Speaker 0: debate.".

326
00:17:53,675 --> 00:17:54,809
Speaker 0: That's actually an okay rule.

327
00:17:56,010 --> 00:18:02,119
Speaker 0: So, one of them complained because- The other guy had an earpiece?

328
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,088
Speaker 0: I mean, come on, what was going on?

329
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:08,046
Speaker 1: There was, in fact, an electronic device on one of the candidates' podiums.

330
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,010
Speaker 1: It was hidden, but it was there.

331
00:18:09,971 --> 00:18:11,929
Speaker 1: It was a small electric fan.

332
00:18:13,453 --> 00:18:14,930
Speaker 0: Oh, that is an electronic device.

333
00:18:15,030 --> 00:18:20,689
Speaker 0: It was technically- And I could argue that that is indeed a competitive advantage in a debate where you might be sweating it.

334
00:18:21,552 --> 00:18:22,387
Speaker 0: You might be sweating it.

335
00:18:23,251 --> 00:18:24,497
Speaker 0: And that might be helping you out.

336
00:18:24,678 --> 00:18:25,622
Speaker 0: It'd look better, right?

337
00:18:25,642 --> 00:18:27,310
Speaker 0: Because it looks better in debates now.

338
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:32,610
Speaker 0: So, if you're sweating and that cools you off, and I'm sweating and everyone can see me sweating, that's an advantage.

339
00:18:32,850 --> 00:18:36,484
Speaker 1: So, Chris, the guy who had the fan, apparently he's known for having this fan everywhere.

340
00:18:36,504 --> 00:18:37,950
Speaker 1: He brings his fucking fan with him everywhere.

341
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:43,790
Speaker 0: There's a guy I play Netrunner with, and we go to the Shady Deli, and the Shady Deli does not always turn on the air conditioner.

342
00:18:43,790 --> 00:18:44,269
Speaker 1: Does he bring a fan?

343
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:51,086
Speaker 0: And often, they have bacon cooking in the ovens, and he bought a fan on Amazon and brings it everywhere.

344
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:52,650
Speaker 0: he plays Netrunner in case it's too hot.

345
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:54,230
Speaker 1: So, Chris does the same thing.

346
00:18:55,251 --> 00:19:03,249
Speaker 1: So, Rick Scott, who's the shit-tier guy, he insisted that the debate rules prohibited the fan, at which point the crowd started booing.

347
00:19:05,010 --> 00:19:08,939
Speaker 0: Well, you bring it up in the front of everyone, right?

348
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:13,710
Speaker 0: That's not good for you, because then people see you bringing it up, and you basically just hurt yourself in the debate.

349
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:20,670
Speaker 0: What you want to do is you want to bring that up beforehand, quietly, to the moderator, and get it taken care of off the scene.

350
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:22,837
Speaker 0: Because that way, what's the other guy going to do?

351
00:19:23,057 --> 00:19:26,429
Speaker 0: Go up on stage and be like, "My opponent was trying to get my fan

352
00:19:26,489 --> 00:19:26,770
Speaker 0: banned.".

353
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:31,208
Speaker 0: Now, he looks like the moron, because whoever brings up something so stupid on stage.

354
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:32,692
Speaker 1: Here, I'm going to read something here.

355
00:19:33,072 --> 00:19:48,928
Speaker 1: As Chris walked onto the stage, the debate moderator, the anchor of CB Whatever, told the crowd and the viewing audience that Scott was also in the building, but that, "We've been told that Governor Scott will not be participating in the debate because of Chris'

356
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:49,329
Speaker 1: fan.".

357
00:19:50,274 --> 00:19:52,470
Speaker 1: He was not willing to debate.

358
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:55,461
Speaker 0: He used it as an excuse to get out of a debate.

359
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:56,405
Speaker 0: He knew he was going to lose.

360
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,630
Speaker 0: That's not a good idea.

361
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,850
Speaker 1: So, they did actually end up debating.

362
00:20:00,315 --> 00:20:00,749
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

363
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, he walked on, and...

364
00:20:03,451 --> 00:20:04,329
Speaker 0: The other guy got rid of the fan?

365
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:10,248
Speaker 1: And then he basically complained, like, "Yeah, sorry I was late, but I wasn't sure if my opponent would show

366
00:20:10,408 --> 00:20:10,448
Speaker 1: up.".

367
00:20:11,331 --> 00:20:12,295
Speaker 1: So, basically, he just lied.

368
00:20:12,315 --> 00:20:14,303
Speaker 1: He was like, "I wasn't about the fan.

369
00:20:14,323 --> 00:20:15,468
Speaker 1: I didn't think he showed

370
00:20:15,568 --> 00:20:15,629
Speaker 1: up.".

371
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,330
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, he was on stage waiting.

372
00:20:18,172 --> 00:20:20,030
Speaker 1: So, this debate was hilarious.

373
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:30,070
Speaker 0: This guy who complained about the fan could have eliminated the fan and had that be a positive in his favor, but instead, he just turned that fan into a negative for him.

374
00:20:30,170 --> 00:20:33,050
Speaker 0: The guy who brought the fan, very good move bringing the fan.

375
00:20:33,390 --> 00:20:33,572
Speaker 1: Yep.

376
00:20:33,673 --> 00:20:35,010
Speaker 1: Now, if I were going to destroy...

377
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:38,029
Speaker 0: The fan did end up being the competitive advantage he had hoped it would be.

378
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:41,498
Speaker 1: If I was going to destroy someone on a fan like this, you can't be petulant.

379
00:20:41,518 --> 00:20:46,790
Speaker 1: You can never appear petulant unless you're attempting to make people think you are petulant, like when I win a game.

380
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:55,606
Speaker 1: So, instead, what you need to do is wait for that moment, like that moment in the presidential debate where Obama was like, "Yeah, what did you say?

381
00:20:55,626 --> 00:20:56,769
Speaker 1: We used to have a lot of cavalry,

382
00:20:56,809 --> 00:20:56,949
Speaker 1: too.".

383
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,749
Speaker 0: See, now, here's a good way I would have done it, right?

384
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:07,187
Speaker 0: If I didn't know about the fan and the debate had already started and there was no way I could bring up the fan without bringing the audience's attention.

385
00:21:07,267 --> 00:21:13,144
Speaker 0: and thus, you know, looking bad, I would have said something along the lines of, "Ah, nice fan you got there.

386
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:13,986
Speaker 0: It's a little

387
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:14,187
Speaker 0: hot.".

388
00:21:15,512 --> 00:21:19,330
Speaker 0: Hey, you know, technically, there's no electronic devices allowed in this debate.

389
00:21:19,390 --> 00:21:20,470
Speaker 1: No, I would have gone one step further.

390
00:21:20,650 --> 00:21:21,349
Speaker 1: You know that, right?

391
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:24,930
Speaker 1: I'd wait until I got in a witty Beaumont.

392
00:21:25,732 --> 00:21:29,050
Speaker 1: I got one of those moments where, you know, I made a point.

393
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:37,330
Speaker 0: Or I could have done the thing where every single answer I make, like, you know, sometimes the news will do a segment where, like, everything is a Princess Bride reference.

394
00:21:38,531 --> 00:21:44,163
Speaker 0: Every single answer is something like, you know, "Yeah, you're gonna ask me about the environment.

395
00:21:44,183 --> 00:21:46,409
Speaker 0: We definitely need to cool off this global

396
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:46,910
Speaker 0: warming.".

397
00:21:47,811 --> 00:21:52,229
Speaker 1: You know, my opponents- You gotta get to the end, like, when they shake hands.

398
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,270
Speaker 0: Or it's like, they're asking you about education.

399
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:55,090
Speaker 0: That was a wonderful debate.

400
00:21:55,171 --> 00:21:57,370
Speaker 0: I'm not a big fan of Common Core.

401
00:21:57,791 --> 00:22:00,199
Speaker 1: That was a great debate, and I want to thank you.

402
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:02,025
Speaker 1: I just want to let you know that I'm a big fan.

403
00:22:02,085 --> 00:22:03,690
Speaker 1: I'm probably your second biggest fan.

404
00:22:05,711 --> 00:22:06,333
Speaker 1: Because he knew!

405
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:12,270
Speaker 1: He came into this planet to bring up this fucking fan, meaning he could have written, like, a hundred fan jokes instead.

406
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:20,050
Speaker 0: But anyone old enough to run for governor and actually, you know, or be a governor is not smart or cool enough to do what we just suggested.

407
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,249
Speaker 0: Maybe someday.

408
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:24,570
Speaker 0: Because politicians are really lucky they don't have to debate us fuckers.

409
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:27,752
Speaker 0: And you know what?

410
00:22:27,792 --> 00:22:30,870
Speaker 0: If they knew they were gonna debate me, they would have left that fan fucking straight at home.

411
00:22:31,111 --> 00:22:32,849
Speaker 1: I got one gamergate kid to block me.

412
00:22:33,901 --> 00:22:34,070
Speaker 1: Okay.

413
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:40,105
Speaker 1: Basically, I kept arguing with him, and eventually he's like, "You keep saying all these things, and I can't respond to all of them.

414
00:22:40,146 --> 00:22:41,128
Speaker 1: You're typing way too

415
00:22:41,188 --> 00:22:41,649
Speaker 1: fast.".

416
00:22:42,030 --> 00:22:44,858
Speaker 1: And then he blocked me, and I was like, "Yeah, it's a victory.

417
00:22:45,901 --> 00:22:49,169
Speaker 1: I'm sorry that my submachine gun brain is faster than your bolt-action

418
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:49,370
Speaker 1: brain.".

419
00:22:53,272 --> 00:22:54,036
Speaker 1: I just thought of that now.

420
00:22:54,096 --> 00:22:56,430
Speaker 1: I wish I'd tweeted that at him, but I guess he blocked me.

421
00:23:05,552 --> 00:23:06,937
Speaker 1: Anyway, things of the day.

422
00:23:06,957 --> 00:23:09,004
Speaker 1: My thing of the day.

423
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:15,387
Speaker 1: So we did our lecture at PAX Prime, "How to Win Every

424
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:15,708
Speaker 1: Game."

425
00:23:16,451 --> 00:23:21,686
Speaker 1: One of the slides, I found this picture of the rules to hockey.

426
00:23:21,706 --> 00:23:23,270
Speaker 1: It's a really good picture.

427
00:23:23,972 --> 00:23:25,830
Speaker 1: I really like this picture of this book.

428
00:23:27,130 --> 00:23:31,423
Speaker 1: It's 1931 official hockey rules for the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association.

429
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:33,690
Speaker 1: Constitution, bylaws, and regulations.

430
00:23:33,910 --> 00:23:37,750
Speaker 0: We should play hockey 100% according to those rules, as opposed to any modern rules.

431
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:38,411
Speaker 1: Ooh.

432
00:23:38,972 --> 00:23:39,714
Speaker 1: Thing is, you know what?

433
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:44,468
Speaker 1: Because the rules are old, I'll bet that just means modern trap strategy is 100% dominant.

434
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,769
Speaker 0: The point is, I'm gonna be the coach and not get killed by the equipment rules.

435
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:51,541
Speaker 1: Well, you don't wanna be the goalie in 1931 rules.

436
00:23:53,094 --> 00:23:53,629
Speaker 0: That's your job.

437
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,150
Speaker 1: That's Jason Mask, at least.

438
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,970
Speaker 0: This is actually just a plot to injure you horribly.

439
00:23:58,613 --> 00:23:59,950
Speaker 1: I thought skiing was gonna take care of that.

440
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,278
Speaker 0: I don't think Jason Mask was then.

441
00:24:01,298 --> 00:24:02,325
Speaker 0: I think Jason Mask was like '60s, '70s.

442
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:03,675
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

443
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:05,309
Speaker 1: Is this Jason Mask era or not?

444
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:06,990
Speaker 0: No, I think that's pre-Jason Mask.

445
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,053
Speaker 1: When?

446
00:24:08,073 --> 00:24:09,650
Speaker 1: I'm just trying to figure this out.

447
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:10,889
Speaker 0: Well, let's move on.

448
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:12,150
Speaker 1: When did... I'll look up when Jason Mask...

449
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:12,909
Speaker 0: Is that your whole thing of the day?

450
00:24:13,090 --> 00:24:13,531
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

451
00:24:13,551 --> 00:24:22,710
Speaker 1: So, I was updating those slides, because I'm gonna be in Australia giving basically the same talk, and I'm giving a mini version of that talk at another convention.

452
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:27,769
Speaker 1: And that convention, because they're gonna redistribute the slides, I gotta have all my citations embedded.

453
00:24:30,011 --> 00:24:32,810
Speaker 1: And I had citations in the notes for most of the stuff.

454
00:24:32,891 --> 00:24:34,300
Speaker 0: We should start doing more citations.

455
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,790
Speaker 0: Sometimes I do it, sometimes I don't.

456
00:24:36,033 --> 00:24:36,990
Speaker 1: Well, I always keep them.

457
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:39,510
Speaker 0: I usually do it when it's an image from Flickr, because it's really easy.

458
00:24:40,030 --> 00:24:44,790
Speaker 1: What I tend to do is, I don't put them in the slide, but I always have them ready in case someone asks.

459
00:24:44,971 --> 00:24:46,469
Speaker 0: I put them in the slide in tiny text.

460
00:24:47,513 --> 00:24:51,390
Speaker 1: But for this thing, I had to put them in the slide, just because this is gonna be redistributed to a ton of people.

461
00:24:51,952 --> 00:24:56,629
Speaker 1: And I went around, and I noticed when I was going through that I didn't actually remember where I got this picture from.

462
00:24:57,372 --> 00:24:58,550
Speaker 1: So I searched for it.

463
00:24:58,570 --> 00:25:00,550
Speaker 0: Dragged the image into Google Image Search to find itself.

464
00:25:01,252 --> 00:25:04,050
Speaker 1: And what I found was something amazing.

465
00:25:04,591 --> 00:25:09,510
Speaker 1: This image, this book, was found in a lost time capsule.

466
00:25:09,730 --> 00:25:11,029
Speaker 0: We just love time capsules, don't we?

467
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,949
Speaker 1: That was discovered a couple years ago.

468
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:13,394
Speaker 1: Whoa!

469
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:16,600
Speaker 1: It's the Maple Leaf Gardens time capsule.

470
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,490
Speaker 0: Whoa, a hockey-specific time capsule?

471
00:25:19,711 --> 00:25:23,787
Speaker 1: Yes, Ryerson University revealed the contents of a 1931 time capsule.

472
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,168
Speaker 0: In Toronto?

473
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:30,890
Speaker 1: That they found inside the walls of Maple Leaf Gardens during a renovation.

474
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:31,414
Speaker 1: Whoa!

475
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:38,750
Speaker 1: It's a 20x12x12 copper box that had the rules of hockey, a bunch of other hockey, all this cool stuff.

476
00:25:39,110 --> 00:25:40,889
Speaker 1: And in fact, there's a mystery.

477
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:43,965
Speaker 1: Other than, like, why'd we lose it?

478
00:25:44,126 --> 00:25:44,690
Speaker 1: How'd we find it?

479
00:25:44,690 --> 00:25:45,942
Speaker 0: How did we not know it was in there?

480
00:25:45,982 --> 00:25:46,750
Speaker 0: Who put it in there?

481
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:51,110
Speaker 1: So, one of the things in there is a tiny hand-carved ivory elephant.

482
00:25:53,054 --> 00:25:55,489
Speaker 1: And no one can figure out what the significance of that is.

483
00:25:56,751 --> 00:25:58,389
Speaker 0: Okay, well, I don't think you're going to.

484
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,310
Speaker 1: They're actually asking the public if anyone can tell them anything.

485
00:26:02,471 --> 00:26:03,410
Speaker 1: An anecdote, a memory, a logo.

486
00:26:03,450 --> 00:26:07,930
Speaker 0: You should look up for people who worked at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1931.

487
00:26:07,930 --> 00:26:11,370
Speaker 1: There are students at Ryerson who are, like, researching this for school.

488
00:26:11,572 --> 00:26:13,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, get, like, the staff list.

489
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:14,517
Speaker 0: Like, who was the janitors?

490
00:26:14,577 --> 00:26:16,710
Speaker 0: Who was the, you know, office workers?

491
00:26:16,970 --> 00:26:18,140
Speaker 0: You know, who was working there?

492
00:26:18,382 --> 00:26:19,390
Speaker 0: Who drove the Zamboni?

493
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:21,390
Speaker 0: You know, who's the equipment managers?

494
00:26:22,613 --> 00:26:24,350
Speaker 0: Who was the, you know, whatever.

495
00:26:24,830 --> 00:26:25,659
Speaker 1: So, yeah, this thing.

496
00:26:26,002 --> 00:26:26,710
Speaker 1: Oh, shit!

497
00:26:27,071 --> 00:26:30,410
Speaker 1: I just noticed they had multiple hockey rule books.

498
00:26:31,094 --> 00:26:33,269
Speaker 1: The 1930 NHL rules are also in there.

499
00:26:34,552 --> 00:26:34,870
Speaker 0: Okay.

500
00:26:36,092 --> 00:26:37,470
Speaker 1: Look inside the Ontario hockey.

501
00:26:37,570 --> 00:26:39,049
Speaker 1: So, yeah, it's all hockey rule books.

502
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:42,530
Speaker 1: It's the time capsule of vintage hockey.

503
00:26:42,950 --> 00:26:43,748
Speaker 0: Dude, you know what we could do?

504
00:26:44,230 --> 00:26:50,530
Speaker 0: We could print, like, physical books that are, like, hockey rules, football rules, tennis rules, soccer rules.

505
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:51,370
Speaker 1: And make a time capsule?

506
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:52,989
Speaker 0: Sell them on Amazon as Kindle books.

507
00:26:53,602 --> 00:26:53,645
Speaker 1: Oh.

508
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,109
Speaker 0: And people will probably buy those.

509
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:56,497
Speaker 0: Yeah.

510
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,210
Speaker 0: Because that's, like, a useful book to have.

511
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,749
Speaker 0: And then we could print on demand them as well.

512
00:27:00,130 --> 00:27:00,242
Speaker 0: Maybe.

513
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:04,070
Speaker 0: As long as we don't, like, I'm sure we can't do that with the NFL rule book because, like, we'll get in trouble.

514
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,270
Speaker 0: We can still do, like, football rules.

515
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:08,589
Speaker 1: But we got to get the old copies of the rules.

516
00:27:08,650 --> 00:27:11,250
Speaker 0: It's like FIFA rule book, but we can do soccer rule book.

517
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,530
Speaker 1: Take the rules that are out in public domain or make our own rules.

518
00:27:14,972 --> 00:27:17,230
Speaker 1: Like, I would basically move hockey more like Olympic hockey.

519
00:27:18,171 --> 00:27:19,210
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's my thing of the day.

520
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,230
Speaker 1: This thing's pretty fucking cool.

521
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,209
Speaker 0: That's my thing of the day.

522
00:27:21,631 --> 00:27:22,430
Speaker 0: I did a Monday News.

523
00:27:22,550 --> 00:27:23,549
Speaker 0: I'll do a Wednesday thing of the day.

524
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,527
Speaker 0: Here is an animation from Mazarasha.

525
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:31,510
Speaker 0: It is this awesome animation that's sort of rotoscoped.

526
00:27:31,610 --> 00:27:36,170
Speaker 0: I'm not even sure if it's rotoscoped or not, but it has this look to it that I've never seen before in any kind of animation.

527
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,630
Speaker 0: It's a -- let's see.

528
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:39,990
Speaker 0: Uploaded on November 8th, 2009.

529
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:40,519
Speaker 0: It's a 1977 cartoon.

530
00:27:42,291 --> 00:27:43,669
Speaker 0: The Soviet Union cartoon film.

531
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:46,090
Speaker 0: The author, Antonily Petrov.

532
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,249
Speaker 0: Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia, Russia.

533
00:27:48,653 --> 00:27:49,228
Speaker 0: Cyrillic words.

534
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:54,970
Speaker 0: The only English word in the title is polygon with English subtitles in parentheses.

535
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,150
Speaker 0: The word with English subtitles in parentheses.

536
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,610
Speaker 0: Anyway, what is this about?

537
00:27:58,690 --> 00:28:01,670
Speaker 0: Is this sort of a sci-fi -- it's almost like an episode of The Twilight Zone.

538
00:28:02,391 --> 00:28:04,890
Speaker 0: This dude is on an island, a tropical island.

539
00:28:05,194 --> 00:28:06,350
Speaker 0: And he seems like an awesome dude.

540
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,350
Speaker 0: He has horrible memories of war or whatever.

541
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,849
Speaker 0: I think from South Africa-ish.

542
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:14,770
Speaker 0: And he built a tank because he's some sort of military, you know, developer or whatever.

543
00:28:15,472 --> 00:28:17,730
Speaker 0: And the Soviet head honcho has come to check out the tank.

544
00:28:18,273 --> 00:28:20,030
Speaker 0: And the tank basically has a mind of its own.

545
00:28:20,110 --> 00:28:21,830
Speaker 0: If you shoot at it, it dodges perfectly.

546
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:25,747
Speaker 0: And then they're like, "Oh, doesn't it have

547
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:26,210
Speaker 0: offense?".

548
00:28:26,412 --> 00:28:27,846
Speaker 0: He's like, "Yeah, I got to turn that

549
00:28:27,987 --> 00:28:28,048
Speaker 0: on.".

550
00:28:28,493 --> 00:28:29,609
Speaker 0: He goes and turns it on.

551
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:31,450
Speaker 0: And then Twilight Zone.

552
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:32,430
Speaker 0: Watch it for yourself.

553
00:28:32,551 --> 00:28:36,390
Speaker 0: It's only 9 minutes and 57 seconds long, counting the credits.

554
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,810
Speaker 1: So I just learned something you probably don't know about this.

555
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:39,588
Speaker 1: You know how they made it?

556
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:40,366
Speaker 0: How'd they make it?

557
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:44,904
Speaker 1: Quote, "The film is drawn using an unusual animation technique called

558
00:28:44,924 --> 00:28:46,530
Speaker 1: 'photographica.'".

559
00:28:46,751 --> 00:28:48,810
Speaker 0: So it wasn't rotoscope, it was something else?

560
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:49,690
Speaker 0: That's why it looks that way?

561
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,669
Speaker 0: Well, they might have rotoscoped.

562
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:52,530
Speaker 1: This is independent of any rotoscope.

563
00:28:53,410 --> 00:29:04,010
Speaker 1: "Photographica consists of two celluloid layers for each character with special color schemes and one of the layers out of focus to imitate a three-dimensional space rendering.

564
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:10,860
Speaker 1: The animation then actively moves the camera and changes the perspective for each scene to give a sense of

565
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,344
Speaker 1: realism.".

566
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:13,160
Speaker 1: So this is pre-CGI 3D stuff.

567
00:29:14,330 --> 00:29:17,970
Speaker 0: This looks different than any animation that you've probably seen in your life.

568
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,302
Speaker 0: Maybe we can look up for other examples of

569
00:29:20,343 --> 00:29:21,067
Speaker 0: "photographica.".

570
00:29:21,832 --> 00:29:23,524
Speaker 1: I can find very few references to

571
00:29:23,585 --> 00:29:24,270
Speaker 1: "photographica.".

572
00:29:24,310 --> 00:29:25,645
Speaker 1: It seems like it's not super well...

573
00:29:26,171 --> 00:29:26,709
Speaker 0: But look at that.

574
00:29:26,932 --> 00:29:28,769
Speaker 0: Can you think of anything else you've seen that looks like that?

575
00:29:29,753 --> 00:29:30,229
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

576
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:33,750
Speaker 0: Also, the story's amazing Twilight Zone-quality story, so...

577
00:29:35,791 --> 00:29:36,168
Speaker 1: Nonro.

578
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:36,981
Speaker 0: Yup.

579
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:39,929
Speaker 0: It's got a lot of things Geek Nights likes.

580
00:29:40,631 --> 00:29:41,025
Speaker 0: Sci-fis.

581
00:29:41,410 --> 00:29:41,687
Speaker 0: Tanks.

582
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:42,609
Speaker 0: Tanks.

583
00:29:43,372 --> 00:29:43,749
Speaker 0: Animations.

584
00:29:44,251 --> 00:29:49,726
Speaker 1: So, in the meta moment, there's no book club book yet, because Scott's probably not gonna read anything until it starts snowing.

585
00:29:50,254 --> 00:29:50,749
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna wait.

586
00:29:51,092 --> 00:29:53,990
Speaker 0: I'm actually... I got time to read right now, especially if you're gonna go away.

587
00:29:54,612 --> 00:29:55,669
Speaker 1: Alright, I'll pick a book then.

588
00:29:55,996 --> 00:29:56,529
Speaker 0: What book is it?

589
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:57,507
Speaker 1: I don't know, I gotta pick one.

590
00:29:58,136 --> 00:29:58,227
Speaker 1: Okay.

591
00:29:58,590 --> 00:30:00,709
Speaker 1: So, I will be in Australia coming up.

592
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:04,010
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be at the fixed protocol conference in Sydney.

593
00:30:04,232 --> 00:30:04,648
Speaker 1: No one cares.

594
00:30:04,871 --> 00:30:07,150
Speaker 1: If anyone wants to go see me talk about video games there.

595
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:11,068
Speaker 0: I think more likely someone will just meet you in Sydney as opposed to, you know...

596
00:30:11,531 --> 00:30:12,950
Speaker 1: But I am giving a talk about games there.

597
00:30:12,970 --> 00:30:14,130
Speaker 0: Going to the fixed conference.

598
00:30:14,310 --> 00:30:15,890
Speaker 1: And then I'm gonna be at PAX Australia.

599
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:18,450
Speaker 1: How to win every game on Friday at 11 Fruit Bad Theater.

600
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,420
Speaker 1: Losing Saturday 2 p.m.

601
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:21,750
Speaker 1: in the Fruit Bad Theater.

602
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:22,490
Speaker 1: Okay.

603
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,790
Speaker 0: Other meta things just to remind everyone.

604
00:30:24,971 --> 00:30:27,450
Speaker 0: Geek Nights has presents everywhere on the internet.

605
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:27,969
Speaker 0: Facebook.

606
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:28,980
Speaker 0: Google+.

607
00:30:29,857 --> 00:30:30,170
Speaker 0: Twitters.

608
00:30:30,851 --> 00:30:32,349
Speaker 0: Are you doing any tumblers over there, maybe?

609
00:30:33,015 --> 00:30:34,150
Speaker 1: I haven't tumbled in a while.

610
00:30:34,450 --> 00:30:35,049
Speaker 1: Actually, no, I did.

611
00:30:35,211 --> 00:30:36,170
Speaker 1: I just tumbled.

612
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:39,390
Speaker 1: I documented NTP for the last fucking time.

613
00:30:41,131 --> 00:30:45,110
Speaker 0: I have a newsletter that I write occasionally that you can subscribe to.

614
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:49,990
Speaker 1: It's a really good newsletter and I'm actually saying that earnestly, not just because I'm the co-host.

615
00:30:50,030 --> 00:30:53,465
Speaker 0: Like, I decided to put original content in it as opposed to just.

616
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:55,689
Speaker 0: these are the episodes of Geek Nights we did recently.

617
00:30:56,251 --> 00:30:59,210
Speaker 1: Think of the newsletter as the secret fifth night of Geek Nights.

618
00:30:59,570 --> 00:30:59,710
Speaker 0: Maybe.

619
00:31:01,074 --> 00:31:02,610
Speaker 0: What else do we have going on?

620
00:31:02,871 --> 00:31:05,049
Speaker 0: There's that one convention, PAX Australia, coming up.

621
00:31:05,432 --> 00:31:06,707
Speaker 1: PAX South is coming up.

622
00:31:07,672 --> 00:31:07,947
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

623
00:31:09,532 --> 00:31:18,470
Speaker 0: We have YouTube channels and we randomly stream video games and Netrunner and other things and so you should follow us on the video YouTubes and Twitches or whatever.

624
00:31:19,012 --> 00:31:24,270
Speaker 1: And, after Australia, we'll actually be able to resume Geek Nights Presents Utena.

625
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,449
Speaker 1: Do not fear all of you people who keep bothering me.

626
00:31:27,751 --> 00:31:29,229
Speaker 1: We're going to keep going.

627
00:31:29,910 --> 00:31:32,390
Speaker 1: Just got to get through convention season.

628
00:31:32,731 --> 00:31:33,850
Speaker 0: I'm actually kind of in the mood.

629
00:31:34,070 --> 00:31:35,968
Speaker 0: I've been listening to some Utena OST at work.

630
00:31:37,710 --> 00:31:49,110
Speaker 1: [singing] Well, also, the next episode is one of the big ones and last night, we had some friends over to celebrate Emily's birthday and have some pretzel bread and we started talking about the new Utena because it's that set, that crowd.

631
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:56,689
Speaker 1: And I remembered a bunch of episodes that are later in the show that I really want to get to to talk about.

632
00:31:57,354 --> 00:31:58,269
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

633
00:31:58,790 --> 00:31:59,097
Speaker 0: That's all.

634
00:31:59,117 --> 00:31:59,730
Speaker 0: I'm going to watch it again.

635
00:32:00,271 --> 00:32:00,546
Speaker 1: Apples?

636
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,368
Speaker 1: Remember the apple?

637
00:32:01,792 --> 00:32:03,170
Speaker 0: I remember there was something about apples.

638
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:04,170
Speaker 1: Remember Kanai?

639
00:32:04,430 --> 00:32:05,388
Speaker 1: Do you remember who that was?

640
00:32:05,971 --> 00:32:07,550
Speaker 0: No, but I do remember shaved ice.

641
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:10,570
Speaker 1: You remember the candelabra?

642
00:32:11,362 --> 00:32:11,488
Speaker 0: No.

643
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:12,405
Speaker 1: Really?

644
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:13,082
Speaker 1: Really.

645
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:15,070
Speaker 1: Do you remember Toga?

646
00:32:15,293 --> 00:32:16,309
Speaker 1: I believe it's your line.

647
00:32:16,741 --> 00:32:16,968
Speaker 1: Yes.

648
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:21,370
Speaker 1: You seem to only remember the fucked up parts, like the sexually fucked up parts.

649
00:32:21,370 --> 00:32:22,290
Speaker 0: They left an impression.

650
00:32:22,551 --> 00:32:23,129
Speaker 1: And the cars.

651
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,390
Speaker 0: Yes, they left an impression, you could say.

652
00:32:26,690 --> 00:32:28,490
Speaker 1: So yes, that show will continue.

653
00:32:30,478 --> 00:32:30,730
Speaker 0: Alright.

654
00:32:31,671 --> 00:32:34,670
Speaker 1: I'm amazed at how many people I know who just don't wear sunglasses.

655
00:32:35,351 --> 00:32:36,750
Speaker 0: Maybe their eyes are not very sensitive.

656
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:44,910
Speaker 1: No, I see them squinting in sunlight all the time, shielding their eyes, unable to see things, blinded by glare, and yet no sunglasses.

657
00:32:44,950 --> 00:32:51,770
Speaker 0: Well, I know that in some cultural settings, like sunglasses are like taboo, and in other places, they're like ultra calm and everyone wears sunglasses all the time.

658
00:32:51,950 --> 00:33:03,109
Speaker 1: Well, I noticed, and I don't know if it's just I noticed this, but when I was in Japan with Emily years ago, I remember distinctly that almost no one was wearing sunglasses outside, no matter how sunny it was.

659
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:06,689
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, in Singapore, everyone was wearing sunglasses.

660
00:33:07,939 --> 00:33:08,268
Speaker 0: There you go.

661
00:33:08,610 --> 00:33:08,706
Speaker 0: Yeah.

662
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:09,209
Speaker 1: You know what?

663
00:33:09,310 --> 00:33:10,109
Speaker 1: Sunglasses are awesome.

664
00:33:10,752 --> 00:33:11,689
Speaker 0: I kind of need sunglasses.

665
00:33:11,971 --> 00:33:22,650
Speaker 0: I mean, my vision is el perfecto, or at least as perfect as, you know, I guess it's not a hundred percent perfect because nothing is, but it's like as good as human vision is going to be on, you know, overall.

666
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,449
Speaker 0: I don't need any assistance whatsoever in seeing anything.

667
00:33:26,091 --> 00:33:32,890
Speaker 1: But I remember something like a third plus of Americans at least have uncorrected, unnoticed vision problems.

668
00:33:33,231 --> 00:33:35,949
Speaker 0: Sure, but I haven't had any vision problems, so.

669
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:36,726
Speaker 1: How would you know?

670
00:33:37,271 --> 00:33:39,270
Speaker 0: Because I can read the eye chart from really far away.

671
00:33:39,711 --> 00:33:40,850
Speaker 1: The eye chart doesn't really, anyway.

672
00:33:41,695 --> 00:33:44,150
Speaker 0: And I've never messed up reading the eye chart anyway.

673
00:33:45,031 --> 00:33:48,889
Speaker 0: Uh, I need fucking sunglasses like all the time, even though it's just like a little bit bright out.

674
00:33:49,370 --> 00:33:50,009
Speaker 0: I need sunglasses.

675
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:51,950
Speaker 0: Otherwise my eyes hurt like, ah, fuck.

676
00:33:52,582 --> 00:33:52,809
Speaker 0: Ah, ah.

677
00:33:53,171 --> 00:34:00,350
Speaker 0: And then maybe because I keep wearing sunglasses all the time, I am now further less tolerant to the brightness like a vampire.

678
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,289
Speaker 0: So I need them even more, but I need them a lot.

679
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:08,688
Speaker 1: I like wearing sunglasses just because they make the world seem a lot sharper because you're getting real, a lot of glare.

680
00:34:09,072 --> 00:34:11,889
Speaker 1: And I'm assuming your sunglasses are polarized, otherwise you're a moron.

681
00:34:12,251 --> 00:34:14,889
Speaker 0: You're polarized, so polarization is the most important thing.

682
00:34:14,989 --> 00:34:18,330
Speaker 0: If you have non-polarized sunglasses, you might as well not have sunglasses.

683
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:20,590
Speaker 0: They're just garbage if they're not polarized.

684
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:35,190
Speaker 1: Now, the angle of polarization matters, actually, because I didn't think a lot about sunglasses because for much of my life, when I was a kid, for example, once I got glasses, having prescription glasses makes sunglasses way more a pain in the ass.

685
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,029
Speaker 0: Your options are- Well, you can get the clippy ones.

686
00:34:37,492 --> 00:34:45,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, the clippy ones make your glasses way heavy, and the kind that your parents will buy you are usually really, really shitty because expensive ones are way expensive.

687
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:56,870
Speaker 0: Right, but the thing with clippy sunglasses is that the regular glasses are where all the fancy lenses, and the sunglasses can just be shitty regular sunglasses that are cheap, and if you lose the clippy-on part, you just get another clippy-on part.

688
00:34:56,949 --> 00:34:57,990
Speaker 1: You never lose the clippy-on part.

689
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:01,810
Speaker 1: I still have the clippy-ons to every pair of glasses I ever owned.

690
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:03,050
Speaker 0: But all those glasses are gone?

691
00:35:03,251 --> 00:35:03,398
Speaker 1: Yes.

692
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:03,841
Speaker 0: Yes?

693
00:35:05,112 --> 00:35:07,343
Speaker 1: I had cool ones once that were magnetic, and they were actually really nice.

694
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:10,930
Speaker 0: But those might fall off in a tough situation.

695
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:14,070
Speaker 1: No, those were some fucking magnets.

696
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:19,388
Speaker 1: Those are the kind of magnets that are probably not allowed on glasses anymore because they'd kill a kid if they ate them.

697
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:19,838
Speaker 0: Oh, alrighty.

698
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,029
Speaker 1: They're really good.

699
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:24,306
Speaker 0: But I remember- How do you get the glasses off?

700
00:35:25,715 --> 00:35:26,590
Speaker 1: Well, you angle them.

701
00:35:27,072 --> 00:35:29,345
Speaker 1: If you take it and you angle it, it's the same way.

702
00:35:29,365 --> 00:35:30,190
Speaker 1: you get a big magnet off.

703
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,008
Speaker 1: You have to angle it.

704
00:35:31,110 --> 00:35:32,750
Speaker 0: Two neodymium magnets stuck together.

705
00:35:33,210 --> 00:35:34,028
Speaker 0: God help you get them off.

706
00:35:34,836 --> 00:35:35,369
Speaker 1: Just throw them away.

707
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,329
Speaker 1: Just give up.

708
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:40,710
Speaker 0: You'll need some kind of machinery, like a vice to hold one of them, and then hit the top one with a hammer.

709
00:35:41,273 --> 00:35:41,527
Speaker 0: I don't know.

710
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:45,490
Speaker 1: We had some super powerful electromagnets in the physics lab in high school.

711
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:46,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can just turn the power off.

712
00:35:47,112 --> 00:35:47,348
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

713
00:35:47,590 --> 00:35:51,850
Speaker 1: But we would fuck around with them a lot when the teachers weren't around.

714
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:52,849
Speaker 0: Oh, I got your belt.

715
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:53,650
Speaker 0: Pants falling down.

716
00:35:53,890 --> 00:35:53,958
Speaker 1: Yep.

717
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:54,570
Speaker 1: Okay.

718
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:59,590
Speaker 1: Of course, one time we rolled the Van de Graaff generator outside the teacher's office.

719
00:35:59,651 --> 00:36:00,730
Speaker 1: He was in there grading papers.

720
00:36:01,290 --> 00:36:02,909
Speaker 1: We just turned it on- Near the doorknob?

721
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:03,260
Speaker 1: Yep.

722
00:36:03,430 --> 00:36:07,989
Speaker 1: We just left it there, running, running, and it ran forever, and we thought we were so clever.

723
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:14,667
Speaker 1: Then later, we look, and we see he's standing in the tiny window of his office, looking out at it.

724
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:21,650
Speaker 1: Then he reaches behind him, and he flicks the switch, and then the lights turn off in the classroom, as does the Van de Graaff generator.

725
00:36:23,732 --> 00:36:25,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not talking about Van de Graaff generators.

726
00:36:25,791 --> 00:36:34,089
Speaker 0: I thought you were going to say he took a metal stick and threw it at the knob or something, and then opened the door, or got a rubber glove and opened the door.

727
00:36:34,310 --> 00:36:41,108
Speaker 1: Then he came out, and he was like, "Yeah, the door frame's grounded, so you're all in

728
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:43,744
Speaker 1: trouble."

729
00:36:43,931 --> 00:36:44,769
Speaker 1: For wasting electricity.

730
00:36:46,451 --> 00:36:47,630
Speaker 1: Anyway, enough about magnets.

731
00:36:48,050 --> 00:36:55,130
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, back when I watched TV, and thus there were ads, there's one ad that I remember, the ad for blue blockers.

732
00:36:55,577 --> 00:36:56,128
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

733
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:57,050
Speaker 1: Blue blockers.

734
00:36:57,591 --> 00:36:58,510
Speaker 0: I never heard of this in my life.

735
00:36:58,690 --> 00:37:07,130
Speaker 1: They were sunglasses, and they had all these ads that made a big deal about the fact that they block the blue light, and blue light scatters more than other lights.

736
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:12,149
Speaker 0: Are these like those fucking Gunnar optics yellow things that they sell at the packs all the time?

737
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:19,490
Speaker 1: See, no, because these were actually aimed at a much lower socioeconomic class back then.

738
00:37:19,731 --> 00:37:22,309
Speaker 1: These were marketed in the bad part of town.

739
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:22,890
Speaker 1: Okay.

740
00:37:23,292 --> 00:37:27,289
Speaker 1: Now it looks like they're trying to market much higher end.

741
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:28,050
Speaker 1: All right.

742
00:37:28,932 --> 00:37:32,090
Speaker 1: By now, I mean they actually still exist, and that's amazing to me.

743
00:37:32,170 --> 00:37:32,990
Speaker 0: Well, the brand still exists.

744
00:37:33,817 --> 00:37:34,890
Speaker 0: Someone just bought it or something.

745
00:37:34,890 --> 00:37:36,869
Speaker 1: They're just amber sunglasses.

746
00:37:37,210 --> 00:37:38,508
Speaker 1: There was nothing special about them.

747
00:37:39,091 --> 00:37:40,870
Speaker 0: Oh, but that's a cool color for sunglasses.

748
00:37:42,095 --> 00:37:43,346
Speaker 1: I feel like amber's only.

749
00:37:43,446 --> 00:37:44,388
Speaker 0: okay- Old people?

750
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:45,910
Speaker 1: Grandpa?

751
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:50,090
Speaker 1: If you're wearing those maybe for a hike on a not sunny day, that's okay.

752
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:58,688
Speaker 1: I prefer the dark black lens, like the darkest blackest possible, but obviously not Stevie Wonder black.

753
00:37:59,510 --> 00:37:59,981
Speaker 1: That wouldn't work.

754
00:38:00,823 --> 00:38:00,970
Speaker 0: Okay.

755
00:38:03,312 --> 00:38:08,049
Speaker 1: Actually, I have like five pairs of sunglasses with all different shades and all different like polarization angles.

756
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:15,289
Speaker 1: I paid attention to a lot of that because when I worked at Pipeline, one of the benefits I got was several thousand dollars of money that could have used in an FSA.

757
00:38:16,193 --> 00:38:19,210
Speaker 0: Oh, and your wallet's too many- Which was stupid.

758
00:38:19,391 --> 00:38:22,530
Speaker 1: FSA's are stupid, and I wish they didn't exist.

759
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:23,510
Speaker 1: They should be illegal.

760
00:38:24,091 --> 00:38:25,869
Speaker 1: I think they're a bad idea all around.

761
00:38:26,150 --> 00:38:27,970
Speaker 0: Especially when you put your money in, then your money disappears?

762
00:38:28,390 --> 00:38:29,114
Speaker 1: FSA is basically.

763
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:36,789
Speaker 1: you put money in pre-tax, and you have to estimate how much money you're going to spend on that kind of healthcare for a year, and at the end of the year if you don't spend it, it's just fucking gone.

764
00:38:37,452 --> 00:38:39,709
Speaker 0: So, why did you put so much money into it?

765
00:38:39,855 --> 00:38:40,048
Speaker 1: I didn't.

766
00:38:40,170 --> 00:38:42,850
Speaker 1: The company filled it just as a benefit.

767
00:38:42,870 --> 00:38:45,650
Speaker 0: Why didn't they just give you that in cash, and you could pay tax on it?

768
00:38:45,871 --> 00:38:46,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know why.

769
00:38:47,093 --> 00:38:48,629
Speaker 1: So, it was a benefit that I had.

770
00:38:49,711 --> 00:38:58,209
Speaker 1: So, what I did is every year I bought thousands of dollars worth of ultra-fancy prescription sunglasses, and I still have them all.

771
00:38:58,877 --> 00:38:59,090
Speaker 0: All right.

772
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:09,229
Speaker 1: So, I started to ... That was when I went from the point of actually just buying the cheapest whatevers to when they asked me, "What polarization angle would you

773
00:39:09,289 --> 00:39:09,530
Speaker 1: like?".

774
00:39:09,590 --> 00:39:13,730
Speaker 1: Is when I realized that even sunglasses can have a nerdery and a rabbit hole.

775
00:39:14,911 --> 00:39:24,210
Speaker 0: So, I needed sunglasses so much as I do with my sensitive to light eyeballs, or at least sensitive to light being, right?

776
00:39:24,291 --> 00:39:25,129
Speaker 0: Not liking the sun.

777
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:29,423
Speaker 0: I used to always get the $20 sunglasses from the rest stop.

778
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:31,749
Speaker 1: Because you lose them.

779
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,407
Speaker 0: Right, because you lose them all the time, and the ones at the rest stop, they're not that bad.

780
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:37,330
Speaker 0: It's like you can get pretty good ones there.

781
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:37,889
Speaker 0: They're comfortable.

782
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:43,347
Speaker 0: They block the light, or I'd go to Macy's and get $20 ones, pretty similar to the ones at the rest stop.

783
00:39:44,378 --> 00:39:45,029
Speaker 0: I kept doing that.

784
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:45,690
Speaker 0: They were flimsy.

785
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:46,270
Speaker 0: They would break.

786
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:47,049
Speaker 0: I would lose them, whatever.

787
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:47,847
Speaker 0: I'd just buy a new one.

788
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:50,049
Speaker 0: Then, eventually, I'm like, "You know what?

789
00:39:50,952 --> 00:39:52,101
Speaker 0: I'm going to get the expensive

790
00:39:52,283 --> 00:39:52,444
Speaker 0: ones.".

791
00:39:53,273 --> 00:39:54,050
Speaker 0: I got Oakleys.

792
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:55,310
Speaker 0: You can get custom Oakleys.

793
00:39:55,450 --> 00:39:56,969
Speaker 0: You can choose everything about them.

794
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:57,177
Speaker 0: Yup.

795
00:39:57,493 --> 00:39:58,569
Speaker 1: I have custom Oakleys, too.

796
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,501
Speaker 0: Costs like $300 or whatever.

797
00:40:00,291 --> 00:40:00,869
Speaker 0: Not that many.

798
00:40:00,930 --> 00:40:01,664
Speaker 0: I made $200, whatever.

799
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:02,548
Speaker 0: But you know what?

800
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:08,690
Speaker 0: I got those so long ago, I lived in Beacon or whatever, and I still have them.

801
00:40:09,212 --> 00:40:10,949
Speaker 0: They haven't broken or been lost.

802
00:40:12,190 --> 00:40:17,430
Speaker 0: I've profited versus buying the $20 ones all the time by buying the one expensive sunglasses.

803
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:18,094
Speaker 1: Yup.

804
00:40:18,813 --> 00:40:19,210
Speaker 0: There you go.

805
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:19,705
Speaker 0: It worked.

806
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:22,446
Speaker 0: The only trouble now- The other thing is you can change the lenses in them.

807
00:40:22,850 --> 00:40:27,288
Speaker 0: You can just pop them out, pop new ones in, so when they get scratched up, if you don't take good care of them, pop, pop.

808
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:28,130
Speaker 1: See, that's the trouble.

809
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:35,490
Speaker 1: I don't get any of those benefits, because if I get prescription Oakleys for sunglasses, there's an extra $1,000 of lens and custom work.

810
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:41,326
Speaker 0: Yeah, the new lenses cost less than $100 for the fancy polarized mirror-y whatever ones.

811
00:40:42,171 --> 00:40:47,409
Speaker 1: I need negative four, four and a half diopters, so the lenses need to be super polycarbonate or whatever.

812
00:40:47,630 --> 00:40:57,528
Speaker 0: There's the rubber bits that go near the nose and on the ears, and those are getting sort of nasty, and I lost one of the nose bits, so I went to the Oakley store near work, and I was just like, "I need this new rubber

813
00:40:57,569 --> 00:40:57,690
Speaker 0: bit.".

814
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:58,074
Speaker 0: They're like, "15

815
00:40:58,074 --> 00:40:58,602
Speaker 0: bucks.".

816
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,469
Speaker 0: I gave them 15 bucks, they replaced all the rubbery bits.

817
00:41:02,112 --> 00:41:02,970
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Oh, all right.

818
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:03,298
Speaker 0: How about

819
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:03,463
Speaker 0: that?".

820
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:03,799
Speaker 0: Yeah.

821
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:11,169
Speaker 0: So that would not happen for the ... But then again, I guess 15 bucks equals another pair of crappy sunglasses.

822
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,190
Speaker 1: So you pretty much just wear the same sunglasses.

823
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:15,950
Speaker 1: If it's bright, you wear the same sunglasses.

824
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:17,990
Speaker 0: Unless I'm wearing Google Glass, which has its own sunglasses.

825
00:41:18,174 --> 00:41:18,284
Speaker 1: Yep.

826
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:24,950
Speaker 1: I have different sunglass types and tints for different situations, because skiing ... Here's an interesting thing.

827
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:28,350
Speaker 0: When you're skiing- Well, don't you need sunglasses in the ski goggle when you're skiing?

828
00:41:28,671 --> 00:41:29,870
Speaker 1: Well, yes, but different colors.

829
00:41:29,950 --> 00:41:30,388
Speaker 1: Here's the deal.

830
00:41:30,831 --> 00:41:33,110
Speaker 1: When you're skiing, it might be really hot out.

831
00:41:33,273 --> 00:41:33,990
Speaker 1: It might be 40, 50 degrees.

832
00:41:34,031 --> 00:41:35,149
Speaker 0: Why would you be skiing when it's hot?

833
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:36,250
Speaker 1: Spring skiing's awesome.

834
00:41:36,491 --> 00:41:45,590
Speaker 1: Or, you start at the way top of a mountain, and then even though it's cold, you're skiing hard so you're getting hot and generating heat, so you might not want to wear a full face mask.

835
00:41:45,610 --> 00:41:47,250
Speaker 0: So you need anti-fog ski sunglasses?

836
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:48,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one part of it.

837
00:41:48,630 --> 00:41:54,006
Speaker 1: But the other thing is, even if it's not bright out, you still need some form of sunglasses usually.

838
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,530
Speaker 0: Because the sun is blasting off the completely white snow and blinding you?

839
00:41:57,911 --> 00:42:10,449
Speaker 1: Even if it's not blinding you, because it's kind of dark out, or really overcast, the glare and the diffusion of light will mean that you can't see edges or features or the shape of the snow.

840
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:10,949
Speaker 0: There might so.

841
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:21,630
Speaker 0: Even though you can see in general, and you wouldn't normally wear sunglasses if you were just standing there, you're going at a high speed and you need to be able to see things far away or in specific places to avoid hitting them and dying.

842
00:42:21,751 --> 00:42:22,090
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

843
00:42:22,250 --> 00:42:26,867
Speaker 1: Imagine if, when you walk on a sidewalk, if you stepped on the crack in the sidewalk, you would literally just fall over.

844
00:42:27,591 --> 00:42:29,809
Speaker 1: So you have to be able to see where the cracks are and not step on them.

845
00:42:30,391 --> 00:42:36,169
Speaker 1: If you don't wear polarized sunglasses on a lot of ski slopes, like at certain times a day, you can't see any of the cracks.

846
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:38,189
Speaker 0: Don't ski, you'll get killed.

847
00:42:38,990 --> 00:42:39,969
Speaker 1: I'm doing okay so far.

848
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:45,290
Speaker 1: So I got these, they're yellow tinted, but that's pretty much it.

849
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:50,570
Speaker 1: And I use those for normal skiing, especially if it's kind of darker dim out.

850
00:42:51,010 --> 00:42:59,150
Speaker 1: And then I got a really bright orange, it's not amber, it's like a bright orange tint that's also super polarized with a prescription glass insert.

851
00:42:59,572 --> 00:43:02,369
Speaker 1: And I use that with a mask if I'm skiing and it's bright out.

852
00:43:02,771 --> 00:43:09,189
Speaker 1: And if it's really bright out, then it's probably also warm and sunny, at least the kinds of places I usually ski.

853
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:15,310
Speaker 1: So then I either put on a different ski mask that has a mirror finish or I'll just wear the Oakleys.

854
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,170
Speaker 1: The super black, 'cause you know Oakley, they have like what, the three levels of black tint?

855
00:43:20,330 --> 00:43:20,988
Speaker 1: I got the blackest.

856
00:43:21,190 --> 00:43:25,690
Speaker 0: They have so many different possible sunglass colors and polarization levels.

857
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:26,229
Speaker 1: What tint do you use?

858
00:43:26,412 --> 00:43:26,890
Speaker 1: Like what percentage?

859
00:43:27,714 --> 00:43:28,309
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

860
00:43:29,212 --> 00:43:35,530
Speaker 0: The ones that go with the ones I have, yeah, it's like bring up the list and I can point them to you and like they have a grid of whatever.

861
00:43:37,450 --> 00:43:39,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, I use the blackest one, I forget what percentage it is.

862
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:43,409
Speaker 0: I think mine are actually not black, they're like silver, mirror, something, I don't know.

863
00:43:44,950 --> 00:43:46,407
Speaker 0: Platinum something, fuck, I don't know.

864
00:43:48,416 --> 00:43:48,706
Speaker 0: Don't know.

865
00:43:49,350 --> 00:43:49,477
Speaker 1: Yup.

866
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:56,649
Speaker 1: But I have not bought new sunglasses in many years because now that I don't work at that company anymore, I'm not spending that much money on sunglasses.

867
00:43:58,251 --> 00:44:13,369
Speaker 0: So, for some reason, right, depending on where you are, it may be acceptable or unacceptable to wear sunglasses in different situations, like I saw someone on Twitter getting mad at people wearing sunglasses in the subway after the subway goes underground, it's like I do that.

868
00:44:13,632 --> 00:44:14,550
Speaker 1: Why would you take them off?

869
00:44:15,230 --> 00:44:16,650
Speaker 0: Well, why would I take them off if I'm wearing them?

870
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,233
Speaker 0: It's more comfortable to keep them on my face than on my head and I needed them when I was outside.

871
00:44:20,333 --> 00:44:23,490
Speaker 0: and if I put them somewhere, that's a surefire way to lose them, right?

872
00:44:23,811 --> 00:44:34,590
Speaker 0: But the other thing is, obviously, some people, especially with sunglasses where you can't see the person's eyes, they're going to assume that you're perving on people or whatever, you know, wearing those sunglasses.

873
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:35,910
Speaker 1: Like, no, dog, I'm asleep.

874
00:44:36,350 --> 00:44:49,150
Speaker 0: But it's like, I might be asleep or I'm mostly just like, oh, I don't have to play the avoid eye contact game, I can just keep my eyes in the most comfortable direction regardless of whether anyone is there making eye contact with me.

875
00:44:49,534 --> 00:44:50,210
Speaker 1: I hate that game.

876
00:44:50,270 --> 00:44:55,810
Speaker 0: Normally, when you're on the subway, you have to constantly play this game of avoid eye contact with everybody, right?

877
00:44:56,510 --> 00:45:00,450
Speaker 0: And every single stop, people get on, people get off, you have to readjust for that game.

878
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:03,890
Speaker 0: If you wear sunglasses, you just you're bowing out like I'm not playing.

879
00:45:05,133 --> 00:45:07,510
Speaker 1: I will wear sunglasses and I'll pretty much wear sunglasses anywhere.

880
00:45:07,630 --> 00:45:08,490
Speaker 1: In fact, there was a period.

881
00:45:08,690 --> 00:45:10,458
Speaker 0: I'll wear them at night and

882
00:45:10,518 --> 00:45:10,598
Speaker 1: if

883
00:45:10,678 --> 00:45:21,810
Speaker 0: I have them on me because I had them on me for some reason and I don't have a place to put them to prevent them from getting lost, I'll put them on my head or face regardless of the level of light that is currently out there.

884
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:25,690
Speaker 1: There's a period when I was at RIT where I wore my sunglasses all the time except when I was home.

885
00:45:25,850 --> 00:45:28,590
Speaker 1: Every class, everywhere, no matter where I went, I wore them.

886
00:45:28,930 --> 00:45:35,809
Speaker 1: I only took them off at club meetings because hard to watch anime with sunglasses on and at home because I was home.

887
00:45:37,491 --> 00:45:42,269
Speaker 1: And the professors didn't seem to like it, but they never gave me any shit about it.

888
00:45:42,870 --> 00:45:45,310
Speaker 1: I guess it didn't matter because I was asleep anyway.

889
00:45:45,531 --> 00:45:49,510
Speaker 0: I don't think I've been given shit about wearing sunglasses at night since like high school.

890
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:53,907
Speaker 1: I guess I don't understand the people who get mad about things like that, like that level of mad.

891
00:45:54,690 --> 00:46:03,143
Speaker 0: Like I can see someone getting mad about like, it's like, yeah, if I'm wearing sunglasses at night, I know that I'm doing that and I'm doing, you know, it's not because I'm trying to be a douche or something, right?

892
00:46:03,891 --> 00:46:04,718
Speaker 0: It's just because.

893
00:46:04,859 --> 00:46:05,949
Speaker 0: what else am I going to do with them?

894
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:10,610
Speaker 1: I have them on me, but I think it's a first principles thing of why is there even this idea?

895
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:11,929
Speaker 1: Like why is there even a question?

896
00:46:12,372 --> 00:46:14,010
Speaker 1: Is it douchey to wear sunglasses at night?

897
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:14,196
Speaker 1: Right.

898
00:46:14,571 --> 00:46:17,849
Speaker 1: I mean, the Blues Brothers taught me that that is in fact proper decorum.

899
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:18,199
Speaker 0: Sure.

900
00:46:19,451 --> 00:46:25,110
Speaker 0: There are some times where it's kind of douchey to wear sunglasses, but usually I had your own wedding.

901
00:46:25,950 --> 00:46:26,010
Speaker 0: OK.

902
00:46:26,331 --> 00:46:31,790
Speaker 0: It's a combination of the person wearing the sunglasses and their demeanor, not simply the wearing of the sunglasses.

903
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:39,690
Speaker 0: For example, you can tell when someone's like a mad high bro who's covering up the fact that they're high but has to do something true.

904
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:42,490
Speaker 1: But then the sunglasses are not the problem.

905
00:46:42,590 --> 00:46:55,929
Speaker 0: The bro is or someone who's like mad celebrity, but, you know, didn't put makeup on or whatever and doesn't want you to see that they're horrible reality and is wearing sunglasses like to walk to the airport where all the paparazzi are.

906
00:46:56,311 --> 00:46:58,449
Speaker 1: But again, that's not a problem with sunglasses.

907
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:00,290
Speaker 1: In fact, that's the utility of sunglasses.

908
00:47:00,550 --> 00:47:08,370
Speaker 0: It is a utility of sunglasses, but it can also make the wearer appear more douchey than, say, a celebrity who doesn't have the sunglasses and just like, hi, everyone, I'm here.

909
00:47:08,510 --> 00:47:09,387
Speaker 0: I'm getting my car by.

910
00:47:10,501 --> 00:47:10,690
Speaker 0: Right.

911
00:47:10,971 --> 00:47:14,469
Speaker 0: You know, you have a different aura that you exude when wearing them.

912
00:47:15,150 --> 00:47:18,770
Speaker 1: I guess I enjoy the aura of stay the fuck away from me.

913
00:47:18,870 --> 00:47:19,244
Speaker 1: Leave me alone.

914
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,109
Speaker 1: I'm a dick bag.

915
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:21,049
Speaker 0: That is my aura.

916
00:47:21,370 --> 00:47:21,522
Speaker 1: Yeah.

917
00:47:23,110 --> 00:47:25,750
Speaker 0: You don't need to go to the aura reading place that's opening up in my neighborhood.

918
00:47:25,910 --> 00:47:27,330
Speaker 1: Talk and he pulls up in his car next.

919
00:47:27,470 --> 00:47:29,310
Speaker 1: She was like, what's this aura I see?

920
00:47:30,172 --> 00:47:31,648
Speaker 0: It's like a blue fire around me.

921
00:47:32,331 --> 00:47:34,490
Speaker 1: I saw this great picture of Midasuji's aura.

922
00:47:35,414 --> 00:47:36,168
Speaker 0: That's your favorite aura.

923
00:47:37,013 --> 00:47:37,850
Speaker 0: It's the same as yours.

924
00:47:40,137 --> 00:47:45,710
Speaker 1: I can't bend over completely backwards and stick my tongue out while maintaining a pedaling cadence on my bike.

925
00:47:45,890 --> 00:47:46,261
Speaker 0: Oh, you can?

926
00:47:47,494 --> 00:47:48,388
Speaker 0: Oh, why can't you?

927
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,169
Speaker 1: I got to stretch more, I guess.

928
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:52,970
Speaker 1: Play more of Voldo and Soul Calibur.

929
00:47:55,554 --> 00:47:57,990
Speaker 0: Are there any other sunglass related anecdotes?

930
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:02,547
Speaker 0: Perhaps sunglasses were lost or broken in a fantastic way and not a mundane way.

931
00:48:03,571 --> 00:48:09,130
Speaker 1: So a friend of ours who will not be named was in Wildwood and she put her sunglasses on and got into the ocean.

932
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:12,530
Speaker 0: I never wear any kind of glasses in any kind of body of water.

933
00:48:12,651 --> 00:48:14,610
Speaker 1: I have lost sunglasses in oceans before.

934
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:20,369
Speaker 0: I won't even go in a large swimming pool with any sort of accessory that could be dislodged from my body.

935
00:48:20,810 --> 00:48:22,609
Speaker 1: See, I wear glasses all the time.

936
00:48:23,132 --> 00:48:24,329
Speaker 0: What about those croaky thingies?

937
00:48:25,753 --> 00:48:27,489
Speaker 1: This person did not have a croaky thingy.

938
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,490
Speaker 0: Aren't those ridiculously dorky and should not be used at all?

939
00:48:30,812 --> 00:48:31,217
Speaker 1: Those are 100% legit.

940
00:48:32,754 --> 00:48:34,430
Speaker 0: I put them in fanny pack territory.

941
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:39,450
Speaker 1: So Scott, would you ride a rollercoaster with your current Oakleys on your eyes unsecured?

942
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:42,690
Speaker 0: No, they give you this little locker before you get on the rollercoaster.

943
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:43,588
Speaker 0: You can put your stuff in.

944
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:47,870
Speaker 1: So you're going to be squinting and uncomfortable for the entire rollercoaster ride?

945
00:48:47,910 --> 00:48:48,780
Speaker 0: I'll just close my eyes and go,

946
00:48:48,821 --> 00:48:49,124
Speaker 0: "Woo!".

947
00:48:49,610 --> 00:48:50,790
Speaker 1: You don't want to have your eyes open?

948
00:48:50,850 --> 00:48:51,950
Speaker 1: That's the whole reason you sit in the front.

949
00:48:52,252 --> 00:48:52,829
Speaker 0: I think I'll be alright.

950
00:48:53,230 --> 00:48:56,170
Speaker 1: Also, a lot of rollercoaster parks don't have those little lockers.

951
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:56,890
Speaker 1: What are you going to do then?

952
00:48:57,051 --> 00:48:58,229
Speaker 0: Not go to that shitty amusement park.

953
00:48:58,951 --> 00:49:03,629
Speaker 1: Some of the big ones, like Cedar Point for the longest time, was you have to know your shit if you get in line.

954
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:09,470
Speaker 1: They'll let you stand in line for four hours and then kick you out because you don't meet some requirement or you're carrying some big bag.

955
00:49:10,391 --> 00:49:11,049
Speaker 0: I think I'll be alright.

956
00:49:12,433 --> 00:49:13,250
Speaker 1: I've never had a problem.

957
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:19,650
Speaker 0: It's been a long time since I've been to an amusement park, but when I went to them, I had sunglasses and it was never a problem.

958
00:49:20,510 --> 00:49:22,030
Speaker 0: I've never lost a sunglass at an amusement park.

959
00:49:22,030 --> 00:49:25,330
Speaker 1: Don't you not ride the proper good upside down rollercoasters?

960
00:49:25,610 --> 00:49:26,270
Speaker 0: I'll ride whatever.

961
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:26,863
Speaker 0: Will you?

962
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:27,726
Speaker 0: Why not?

963
00:49:28,211 --> 00:49:28,790
Speaker 0: What's going to happen?

964
00:49:29,130 --> 00:49:29,950
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.

965
00:49:30,233 --> 00:49:31,570
Speaker 1: I remember old conversations.

966
00:49:33,252 --> 00:49:37,669
Speaker 0: I generally try to avoid ... It's not like I'm afraid to ride anything at an amusement park.

967
00:49:38,210 --> 00:49:41,430
Speaker 0: I just try to avoid riding anything that I'm pretty sure will make me boggle.

968
00:49:43,651 --> 00:49:44,698
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh no, I can't ride.

969
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:47,077
Speaker 0: That is

970
00:49:47,097 --> 00:49:47,569
Speaker 0: dangerous.".

971
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:50,870
Speaker 0: It's a safe amusement park ride that hundreds of people have ridden all summer without being.

972
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:52,550
Speaker 1: How could a rollercoaster make you boggle?

973
00:49:53,712 --> 00:49:55,630
Speaker 0: Because you can boggle on a rollercoaster.

974
00:49:56,337 --> 00:49:59,449
Speaker 0: No, the only people who do that- Especially if I just ate a funnel cake or some shit.

975
00:49:59,850 --> 00:49:59,892
Speaker 1: No.

976
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:01,730
Speaker 0: Yeah.

977
00:50:01,910 --> 00:50:02,750
Speaker 1: You're just bad at rollercoasting.

978
00:50:02,956 --> 00:50:03,268
Speaker 0: I find rim.

979
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:06,910
Speaker 0: Let's eat funnel cakes and go on the craziest rollercoaster they have ever been.

980
00:50:06,970 --> 00:50:08,088
Speaker 1: Scott, I've done that.

981
00:50:09,031 --> 00:50:10,789
Speaker 0: And then I'll punch you in the stomach while riding it.

982
00:50:11,152 --> 00:50:11,830
Speaker 1: I'm not Houdini.

983
00:50:12,472 --> 00:50:12,736
Speaker 1: That's not.

984
00:50:12,757 --> 00:50:13,550
Speaker 1: Houdini died.

985
00:50:15,756 --> 00:50:16,590
Speaker 0: On a rollercoaster?

986
00:50:17,892 --> 00:50:18,624
Speaker 1: Some dude was like,

987
00:50:18,665 --> 00:50:18,909
Speaker 1: "Yeah."

988
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:19,488
Speaker 1: Wearing sunglasses.

989
00:50:19,810 --> 00:50:20,690
Speaker 1: I'll punch you in the stomach.

990
00:50:21,170 --> 00:50:22,949
Speaker 0: It's Houdini on a rollercoaster wearing sunglasses.

991
00:50:23,414 --> 00:50:24,628
Speaker 0: Then he gets punched in the stomach.

992
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:28,747
Speaker 0: No, he literally died from just a punch, not from the other parts.

993
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:29,190
Speaker 0: that did not-.

994
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,910
Speaker 1: Also, I've seen other people lose sunglasses on rollercoasters.

995
00:50:33,474 --> 00:50:33,601
Speaker 0: Whoa.

996
00:50:33,954 --> 00:50:34,190
Speaker 0: All right.

997
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:38,730
Speaker 1: I was on the Magnum XL 200, which at the time was the tallest rollercoaster in the world.

998
00:50:38,971 --> 00:50:41,010
Speaker 1: It was also the fastest rollercoaster in the world.

999
00:50:41,211 --> 00:50:41,609
Speaker 0: At the time.

1000
00:50:41,850 --> 00:50:42,869
Speaker 0: Now it's a normal rollercoaster.

1001
00:50:43,010 --> 00:50:45,630
Speaker 1: Well, now it's still one of the faster and taller.

1002
00:50:46,893 --> 00:50:50,222
Speaker 0: Most of the fastest and tallest ones now are really boring, like straight up and down the end.

1003
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:50,660
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1004
00:50:50,832 --> 00:50:53,810
Speaker 0: Well- These vertical spiral things and whatnot.

1005
00:50:54,290 --> 00:50:58,430
Speaker 1: I forget the term for that kind of coaster- They are the tallest and the fastest.

1006
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:03,189
Speaker 1: Those came into vogue after the steel coaster tube in and out types.

1007
00:51:04,271 --> 00:51:07,810
Speaker 1: That was the fallen empires of the rollercoaster era.

1008
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:18,610
Speaker 0: There's one in Taiwan that's like this big U-shaped one where it's like you go ... Basically, it's a hanging one where you're sitting in a seat hanging and it uses a Gauss cannon, shoots you forward.

1009
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:19,829
Speaker 0: You go up one side.

1010
00:51:20,475 --> 00:51:22,110
Speaker 0: Then you fall down, of course, backwards.

1011
00:51:22,910 --> 00:51:28,409
Speaker 0: Then you go up the other side backwards, then down it facing forwards, then up the other side and back and forth.

1012
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:30,090
Speaker 1: Last I checked, multiple fan bodies.

1013
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:33,270
Speaker 0: It twists a bit, so it doesn't just go straight up.

1014
00:51:33,370 --> 00:51:35,329
Speaker 0: It twists on the way up and on the way down.

1015
00:51:36,070 --> 00:51:37,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, those are bullshit coasters.

1016
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:46,350
Speaker 1: I like the standard steel, one main hill, two to three secondary hills, big loopy thing, and then come back in a high-speed rolling hill situation.

1017
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:50,450
Speaker 1: That's like the standard steel coaster Intamin playbook for years.

1018
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,710
Speaker 1: The Magnum was that.

1019
00:51:51,970 --> 00:51:55,650
Speaker 1: The Magnum was basically like the archetype of that kind of coaster.

1020
00:51:56,475 --> 00:51:57,190
Speaker 1: That's the best kind.

1021
00:51:57,370 --> 00:52:08,809
Speaker 1: After the first year or two, they added brakes to it to slow down the first hill because it was going so fast that a non-trivial number of people were getting minor whiplash and a few people broke their noses.

1022
00:52:09,253 --> 00:52:09,769
Speaker 0: That's not good.

1023
00:52:11,437 --> 00:52:13,550
Speaker 1: I rode it just fine when it was that fast.

1024
00:52:14,171 --> 00:52:14,808
Speaker 1: It was fine.

1025
00:52:15,971 --> 00:52:23,530
Speaker 1: But I was riding it one time, and we were in the last car, meaning you're slow because you kind of hang down, so you're slower going down.

1026
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:30,910
Speaker 1: You experience less speed on the actual downhill, but you're going at the maximum possible speed on the uphill as you get whipped around the top of the next hill.

1027
00:52:31,577 --> 00:52:32,170
Speaker 1: We hit the back.

1028
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:36,146
Speaker 1: We whip around the top, and this girl sitting in front of me and her sunglasses just went straight up.

1029
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,410
Speaker 0: Straight up in the air?

1030
00:52:38,653 --> 00:52:38,885
Speaker 0: Just woo!

1031
00:52:39,792 --> 00:52:41,369
Speaker 0: That's one more thing I talk about, right?

1032
00:52:41,672 --> 00:52:43,930
Speaker 0: I have Google Glass with the sunglasses.

1033
00:52:45,152 --> 00:52:47,250
Speaker 1: I can't experience that, so I don't know what that's like.

1034
00:52:47,250 --> 00:52:57,250
Speaker 0: The number one reason I don't wear that more often is because the way Google Glass attaches to your head is it puts force downwards on the top of your ears.

1035
00:52:58,618 --> 00:52:59,069
Speaker 1: It's true.

1036
00:52:59,510 --> 00:53:05,830
Speaker 1: Good sunglasses and these glasses, the weight is distributed perfectly evenly between ear, ear, temple, temple, nose, nose.

1037
00:53:06,230 --> 00:53:17,650
Speaker 0: The Google Glass is basically pushing down on your ears, especially the right ear because that's carrying the weight of the actual device, so the nook of my right ear gets irritated wearing Google Glass for extended periods of time.

1038
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:23,079
Speaker 0: The Oakley sunglasses I have, the way they attach to my head, they don't push down at all.

1039
00:53:23,410 --> 00:53:27,866
Speaker 0: I mean, they don't weigh anything either, but they push inwards towards the sides of my head.

1040
00:53:28,111 --> 00:53:57,354
Speaker 0: They're basically sticking to the side of my head like a clampy forcep kind of deal, so I can position the two wings up high, down low near my ears, pretty much anywhere on the side of my head, and they don't move, especially with the rubber grippy bits on the side, so they're ridiculously comfortable because it's not uncomfortable to have something lightly pressing against the side of your head, where there's a nice skull there, which is pretty durable,

1041
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:58,257
Speaker 1: but the

1042
00:53:58,357 --> 00:54:02,369
Speaker 0: sensitive ear flesh having weight applied to it is not good.

1043
00:54:02,590 --> 00:54:10,583
Speaker 1: Google Glass was designed as a piece of technology and does not have the history of glasses design behind it.

1044
00:54:11,712 --> 00:54:13,150
Speaker 1: Glasses do not have that problem.

1045
00:54:14,411 --> 00:54:18,629
Speaker 0: I've never had that problem with any other glasses-like thing I've ever worn, which is mostly sunglass.

1046
00:54:18,810 --> 00:54:37,289
Speaker 1: For me, Google Glass does not have that problem because I replaced that frame with basically what it wants to a regular glasses frame, so to this day, coaster bus- But then, what do I do if I want to wear a Google Glass and not wear sunglasses simultaneously?

1047
00:54:38,030 --> 00:54:47,130
Speaker 1: To this day, the Magnum XL 200, despite decades of advancement, is still ranked the 33rd best roller coaster in the world by Coaster Buzz.

1048
00:54:48,915 --> 00:54:50,240
Speaker 0: Where does the-?

1049
00:54:50,260 --> 00:55:03,516
Speaker 0: I've never ridden it, obviously, because never went to Cedar Point, but the most similar coaster to that, in your description that I have ridden, is the Superman at Six That's ranked 35th.

1050
00:55:04,850 --> 00:55:05,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not bad.

1051
00:55:06,210 --> 00:55:06,850
Speaker 1: That's okay.

1052
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:15,510
Speaker 1: So, the successor type of coaster to that was typified by the Millennium Force, which was also the tallest- Which is even bigger, which is one third bigger.

1053
00:55:17,051 --> 00:55:23,149
Speaker 1: So, to this day, the Millennium Force is ranked number four in the world, and it was built when I was in high school.

1054
00:55:24,293 --> 00:55:28,690
Speaker 0: It is- I mean, aren't the only things that are taller and faster, like not, are the stupid kind?

1055
00:55:28,710 --> 00:55:39,529
Speaker 1: Yes, there is, I believe, one out-and-back coaster, one or two, that are taller or faster, but they're not better by most rankings because they're very simple.

1056
00:55:40,933 --> 00:55:42,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, not getting into roller coasters.

1057
00:55:44,312 --> 00:55:45,830
Speaker 0: Tangent and sunglasses to roller coasters.

1058
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:47,110
Speaker 1: Otherwise, we'll start talking about Intamin.

1059
00:55:47,530 --> 00:55:47,617
Speaker 0: Sure.

1060
00:55:48,235 --> 00:55:48,590
Speaker 0: All right.

1061
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:51,350
Speaker 1: I'm kind of thinking about going back to Cedar Point, though.

1062
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:53,310
Speaker 0: My brother was there pretty recently.

1063
00:55:53,850 --> 00:56:01,270
Speaker 1: You want to, like next summer, you want to take a trip to- All the amusement parks are always open on Halloween.

1064
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:03,529
Speaker 1: Cedar Point's Halloween is fucking baller, too.

1065
00:56:03,770 --> 00:56:03,890
Speaker 1: Right?

1066
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:05,470
Speaker 0: Every amusement park's Halloween is baller.

1067
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,702
Speaker 0: That's like, they're like, "All right, let's open one more day, guys,

1068
00:56:07,722 --> 00:56:07,782
Speaker 0: woo.".

1069
00:56:10,091 --> 00:56:13,190
Speaker 1: Next summer, because I don't know if I'll go to Paxos a third year in a row.

1070
00:56:13,390 --> 00:56:13,969
Speaker 1: No, you won't.

1071
00:56:14,250 --> 00:56:19,308
Speaker 1: You want to go to Cedar Point and just ride, because we haven't ridden roller coasters in how many years?

1072
00:56:20,052 --> 00:56:20,889
Speaker 0: We're going to Barge Lodge.

1073
00:56:21,090 --> 00:56:21,715
Speaker 1: Want to just go?

1074
00:56:21,776 --> 00:56:23,509
Speaker 1: get it all out of our system in one go.

1075
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:24,436
Speaker 0: We can pay the-.

1076
00:56:24,518 --> 00:56:25,430
Speaker 0: The thing is, we have money.

1077
00:56:25,510 --> 00:56:27,559
Speaker 0: We can go and do the maximum pass.

1078
00:56:27,619 --> 00:56:30,029
Speaker 0: that's like, cut every line or whatever they sell.

1079
00:56:30,890 --> 00:56:31,928
Speaker 1: Shall I warm, sirs?

1080
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:32,770
Speaker 1: Vomit bag.

1081
00:56:33,192 --> 00:56:34,089
Speaker 0: Yes, you shall.

1082
00:56:34,470 --> 00:56:36,010
Speaker 0: In fact, it's quite warm already.

1083
00:56:36,472 --> 00:56:37,430
Speaker 0: Let's heat it up some more.

1084
00:56:37,551 --> 00:56:38,109
Speaker 0: Another photo cake.

1085
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:39,109
Speaker 1: I feel like we should do this.

1086
00:56:39,310 --> 00:56:42,270
Speaker 1: Rather than riding, because that one time we rode that shit roller coaster in Wildwood.

1087
00:56:42,551 --> 00:56:44,290
Speaker 0: We should start with the smallest and work our way up.

1088
00:56:44,410 --> 00:56:51,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the Magnum is super fun, but if you ride the Millennium Force, it literally makes every other coaster you'll ever ride in the rest of your life feel really pathetic.

1089
00:56:52,591 --> 00:57:01,167
Speaker 1: So, if you and I go to Cedar Point, you're riding the Millennium Force last, and you just got to be comfortable with the fact that you're never going to ride a roller coaster again.

1090
00:57:01,490 --> 00:57:02,630
Speaker 0: Well, we could just ride that one again.

1091
00:57:02,990 --> 00:57:03,329
Speaker 1: You could.

1092
00:57:03,955 --> 00:57:04,170
Speaker 0: Anyway.

1093
00:57:04,611 --> 00:57:06,569
Speaker 1: We could just ride that all day and skip everything else.

1094
00:57:07,210 --> 00:57:08,189
Speaker 0: I'll leave my sunglasses at home.

1095
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:16,220
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1096

1104
00:58:06,641 --> 00:58:07,640
Speaker 1: They're really different.

1105
00:58:08,263 --> 00:58:09,000
Speaker 1: My name is Geek.

1106
00:58:09,141 --> 00:58:10,579
Speaker 1: I put them on as a shocker.

1107
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:12,880
Speaker 1: Man, I love these blue blockers.

1108
00:58:13,240 --> 00:58:13,879
Speaker 1: Everything is clear.

1109
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,118
Speaker 1: They block out the sun.

1110
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:15,770
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1111
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:17,219
Speaker 1: I got to get me some.
