1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,478
Speaker 0: It's Monday April 2nd.

2
00:00:11,839 --> 00:00:12,381
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,722 --> 00:00:15,030
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:16,212 --> 00:00:19,089
Speaker 0: Tonight we talked a bit about April Fool's Day on the internet.

5
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:40,160
Speaker 0: Let's do this now Yesterday being April Fool's Day We had a plan for today that we'd made up about I don't know a long time ago when we were first trolling for logos For the show and our dear friend cat and made a really cool geek nights logo.

6
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:48,472
Speaker 0: And then as a joke because it fit she made a leak nights logo because back then That leak spin thing was all over the Internet.

7
00:00:48,894 --> 00:00:50,700
Speaker 1: Yep leak spin was real popular.

8
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:55,893
Speaker 1: We talked about it for like three or four days on this show Maybe I've even two weeks and it was.

9
00:00:56,054 --> 00:01:04,578
Speaker 1: it was all over the forums everyone couldn't stop posting different variations on leaks and leaks spinning and We even took a picture of rim and the grocery store holding a leak.

10
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:10,160
Speaker 1: So she made this leak nights logo and then rim said hey, we should do an actual show of leak nights.

11
00:01:10,481 --> 00:01:16,160
Speaker 0: And the few people I told this to thought it was an awesome idea and Scott said it and left it at that.

12
00:01:16,381 --> 00:01:19,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know, I wasn't particularly for or against this idea.

13
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:23,512
Speaker 0: So anyway, I my idea was that on April Fool's.

14
00:01:23,572 --> 00:01:27,366
Speaker 0: what we should do is especially if it was a Monday You know a science and tech kind of day.

15
00:01:27,848 --> 00:01:30,480
Speaker 0: We do the show straight up like a normal show.

16
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:32,780
Speaker 0: We have two news's or two things of the day.

17
00:01:32,923 --> 00:01:40,324
Speaker 0: We do the main bit But the news is both have to involve leaks and the things the days are both leaks and then the main article Was all about leaks.

18
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:51,480
Speaker 0: but our normal episode except we do real well-researched real News and thing of the day as entertaining as we always are about leaks and we very subtly say leak nights instead of geek nights.

19
00:01:51,982 --> 00:01:56,460
Speaker 0: I thought that would have been a great April Fool's definitely better than what slash dots done for the last decade.

20
00:01:56,782 --> 00:01:59,616
Speaker 1: Oh, it would definitely been better than what slash dot is done ever.

21
00:02:00,721 --> 00:02:03,678
Speaker 1: It would have been better than pretty much what any website has ever done.

22
00:02:05,566 --> 00:02:06,278
Speaker 1: It's not good enough.

23
00:02:06,601 --> 00:02:10,713
Speaker 0: Well, see I asked you the listeners would have been funny if we had done that.

24
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:14,705
Speaker 0: and we've done it straight up with the same Level of entertaining and quality and everything.

25
00:02:14,726 --> 00:02:23,075
Speaker 0: We always have as opposed to uh, when earlier today while we're having some Japanese food at the neck Oh Scott says I don't like that idea.

26
00:02:23,396 --> 00:02:24,140
Speaker 0: Let's not do it.

27
00:02:24,722 --> 00:02:26,491
Speaker 1: I never really did like that idea that much.

28
00:02:26,773 --> 00:02:29,563
Speaker 0: Yeah, you didn't come up with any alternative Other than it.

29
00:02:29,924 --> 00:02:35,950
Speaker 1: what you did want to do is go on and have this thing where if I don't like something I have to have an alternative.

30
00:02:36,071 --> 00:02:37,880
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's no good.

31
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,787
Speaker 1: It's like I if an ugly person comes up and I say wow, you're ugly You're like well who's good-looking then?

32
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,960
Speaker 1: and if I can't name anyone good-looking and that person's not ugly somehow.

33
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,266
Speaker 0: Well, it has to do with the show.

34
00:02:48,326 --> 00:02:49,150
Speaker 0: more cuz think of this.

35
00:02:49,652 --> 00:02:51,500
Speaker 0: We've got to do the show on something.

36
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:54,591
Speaker 0: We need a topic every night four nights a week for the rest of our lives.

37
00:02:54,631 --> 00:02:55,996
Speaker 0: We need a topic to talk about.

38
00:02:56,016 --> 00:03:00,214
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and Say we've got a topic that we've kind of decided on.

39
00:03:00,254 --> 00:03:02,969
Speaker 0: maybe it's a crab people idea I don't know, but we got an idea.

40
00:03:03,432 --> 00:03:10,540
Speaker 0: if you're gonna veto that idea And you'd better come up with something else to replace it because otherwise we got a default to the last best idea we had.

41
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:13,431
Speaker 1: Well, I wanted to do a compromise.

42
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:14,375
Speaker 1: No, I want to do it.

43
00:03:14,415 --> 00:03:15,620
Speaker 1: Well, I don't want to do that, too.

44
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:21,659
Speaker 1: Yes, I wanted to do a compromise where we would have the leak news and things of the day and call it You know leak nights.

45
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,720
Speaker 1: But then the main bit I didn't think should have been a leak bit because that would have run out dry real fast.

46
00:03:26,901 --> 00:03:27,504
Speaker 0: I don't think it would.

47
00:03:27,524 --> 00:03:31,667
Speaker 0: if I think I could have been entertaining for a half hour about leaks What was I gonna say about leaks?

48
00:03:31,847 --> 00:03:34,460
Speaker 0: I think you could have been entertaining for 15 minutes of that half hour.

49
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:35,083
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

50
00:03:35,143 --> 00:03:36,088
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

51
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:36,913
Speaker 0: I think so.

52
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,300
Speaker 0: I think it would have been a challenge.

53
00:03:39,881 --> 00:03:51,180
Speaker 0: Maybe that'll be a contest sometime in the future because I'm still disappointed in you guys over the Wednesday contest though I've been listening to some of those submissions from the Thursday contest and you might have all redeemed yourselves.

54
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:53,288
Speaker 0: You found some pretty goddamn bad.

55
00:03:53,489 --> 00:03:56,480
Speaker 1: I didn't think there were podcasts that bad but there no god.

56
00:03:56,821 --> 00:04:02,344
Speaker 1: I knew there were partners that the rim was playing them at iTunes on the TV and I was just like turn it up Turn it up.

57
00:04:02,525 --> 00:04:03,129
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

58
00:04:03,531 --> 00:04:05,040
Speaker 0: I knew there were podcasts that bad.

59
00:04:05,421 --> 00:04:09,880
Speaker 0: I didn't know there were podcasts that bad for the people didn't stop after a couple of episodes.

60
00:04:10,621 --> 00:04:12,046
Speaker 0: Good God, I mean one of them.

61
00:04:12,147 --> 00:04:14,134
Speaker 0: every episode is like two hours long.

62
00:04:14,194 --> 00:04:15,620
Speaker 0: One of them was three hours long.

63
00:04:17,928 --> 00:04:18,678
Speaker 1: I was gonna cry.

64
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:28,272
Speaker 1: It's good though because you know used to be if you wanted to torture someone you tie him into a chair and make him watch Barney or something like that, you know Barney the big purple dinosaur.

65
00:04:28,653 --> 00:04:30,220
Speaker 1: now, it's real easy.

66
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:37,158
Speaker 1: You just get some of these podcasts put headphones on someone and put them in like a bed And then they have to listen to it.

67
00:04:37,621 --> 00:04:38,203
Speaker 0: Well, you could always.

68
00:04:38,223 --> 00:04:41,216
Speaker 0: I mean we were talking about the leak spin not to be confused with the meat spin.

69
00:04:41,236 --> 00:04:44,946
Speaker 1: Oh god Oh God.

70
00:04:52,851 --> 00:04:53,273
Speaker 0: But yeah.

71
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:56,084
Speaker 0: instead we argued a bit with Alex.

72
00:04:56,104 --> 00:04:57,710
Speaker 0: they're pretty much just watching amused at least.

73
00:04:58,112 --> 00:04:58,656
Speaker 0: What are we gonna do?

74
00:04:58,736 --> 00:05:05,085
Speaker 0: April Fool's Day on and we realized that There's really only one way to come out on top on April Fool's Day now one.

75
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:11,868
Speaker 0: you can have the awesome prank which usually will backfire because one if you do an April Fool's prank that's different from an April Fool's fool.

76
00:05:11,888 --> 00:05:16,785
Speaker 0: a Prank is like I put a water bucket over Scott's door on April 1st.

77
00:05:16,906 --> 00:05:17,267
Speaker 0: Haha.

78
00:05:17,347 --> 00:05:17,950
Speaker 1: I love those.

79
00:05:18,231 --> 00:05:18,893
Speaker 1: Those are great.

80
00:05:19,134 --> 00:05:23,250
Speaker 1: or problem is I've tried that a couple times in my life and I've got it works.

81
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,319
Speaker 1: But the bucket always lands on the person.

82
00:05:25,359 --> 00:05:27,409
Speaker 1: it hurts and I only want the water to land on.

83
00:05:27,429 --> 00:05:31,064
Speaker 0: that's why You got to use a little plastic bucket because a little bit of water goes a long way.

84
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:33,536
Speaker 0: think say you're dressed up in business Clothes ready to go to work.

85
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:36,611
Speaker 0: if someone gets you with a super soaker Good.

86
00:05:36,992 --> 00:05:39,201
Speaker 0: or get you with a bucket or get you with ten buckets.

87
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:42,651
Speaker 0: the end feeling you have is the same True.

88
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:47,806
Speaker 1: Did you see that video of in slow motion of a water balloon hitting a guy straight in the forehead?

89
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:48,990
Speaker 0: Yes, I did.

90
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:49,973
Speaker 0: It was awesome.

91
00:05:50,776 --> 00:05:56,012
Speaker 0: Ah, there was a kid at my high school who took a water balloon to the face and ended up almost losing Mmm-hmm.

92
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:56,815
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

93
00:05:56,855 --> 00:05:57,657
Speaker 1: I took Santa the.

94
00:05:57,758 --> 00:06:04,497
Speaker 0: I once granted that water balloon was thrown from a car going about 45 and The person who did it went to jail.

95
00:06:04,517 --> 00:06:05,339
Speaker 0: Mmm.

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,126
Speaker 0: Yes, but actually I heard.

97
00:06:07,246 --> 00:06:14,410
Speaker 0: probably I mean I've seen some good April Fool's pranks in my life and sadly most of the best ones were done on TV and staged.

98
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:20,830
Speaker 0: But anyway, someone on FARC had the best goddamn idea and apparently he did this over the course of like five years.

99
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:28,644
Speaker 0: You know those jars of peanuts or whatever with the obvious fake label on it, but when you open the top Oh god, snakes pop out and everyone has a good.

100
00:06:28,725 --> 00:06:29,610
Speaker 1: not even snakes.

101
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:33,229
Speaker 1: They're just like Springs with piece of plastic wrapped around them.

102
00:06:33,692 --> 00:06:39,748
Speaker 0: So this guy on FARC when everyone else is bitching about April Fool's Day Apparently he took one of these with the fake label on it.

103
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:47,910
Speaker 0: but he took the snakes out and he filled it with peanuts and he gives it to his friend his friends looking at it like This is the fake freaking snakes and he turns it upside down.

104
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,481
Speaker 0: So the snakes don't hit him and he opens it.

105
00:06:49,663 --> 00:06:50,569
Speaker 0: the peanuts fall out.

106
00:06:51,573 --> 00:06:52,661
Speaker 0: What the fuck are you doing?

107
00:06:52,882 --> 00:06:53,890
Speaker 0: I gave you those peanuts.

108
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:56,396
Speaker 0: So it is.

109
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,030
Speaker 1: this is the great I just got to say this story.

110
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,755
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is about this story.

111
00:07:00,815 --> 00:07:05,630
Speaker 1: But as soon as you start telling someone the story, it's obvious what's gonna happen.

112
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:12,803
Speaker 1: It's the whole story is immediately obvious as soon as the person's telling the story says Candace snakes, right yet.

113
00:07:13,004 --> 00:07:14,150
Speaker 1: It's still hilarious.

114
00:07:14,613 --> 00:07:15,781
Speaker 1: Just to hear the story.

115
00:07:15,802 --> 00:07:16,648
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

116
00:07:16,668 --> 00:07:23,855
Speaker 0: well The thing is the guy was smart and he did it like every year for three or four years and every year that people think He's gonna get me.

117
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,286
Speaker 0: He's gonna get me and then always turn it over turn it upside down.

118
00:07:26,789 --> 00:07:29,589
Speaker 0: one year He gives it to the guy guy opens it up snakes.

119
00:07:32,613 --> 00:07:33,340
Speaker 0: It's just perfect

120
00:07:34,026 --> 00:07:36,559
Speaker 1: snakes snakes on a plane,

121
00:07:37,002 --> 00:07:52,182
Speaker 0: but since We we didn't actually get to do our April Fool's extravaganza, which in retrospect I think I really miss being at RIT mostly for the fact that at the RIT anime club We ran some motherfucking pranks back in our day.

122
00:07:52,202 --> 00:07:53,770
Speaker 1: Oh, those are those April Fool's Day.

123
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:59,287
Speaker 0: Then was I remember we sat there you me and James for like four hours preparing the next day's fool.

124
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:00,050
Speaker 1: We did.

125
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:05,625
Speaker 1: It was the greatest fool I think ever and we discovered who was fools and who was not.

126
00:08:05,706 --> 00:08:14,816
Speaker 0: basically we discovered that of the 200 or so people who were there for that showing maybe 12 of them had an IQ above 70 Either that it.

127
00:08:14,856 --> 00:08:16,930
Speaker 1: I really like track and ball and Linkin Park.

128
00:08:18,813 --> 00:08:24,889
Speaker 0: But then we realized that all right We can either try to do some half-assed April Fool's prank or maybe we can do that.

129
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:29,922
Speaker 0: Oh, we're web comics and we're all gonna draw each other's comics and won't it be delightful?

130
00:08:29,942 --> 00:08:32,308
Speaker 1: or just like the newspaper comics do?

131
00:08:32,688 --> 00:08:34,033
Speaker 0: or oh We're slash-dot.

132
00:08:34,254 --> 00:08:38,150
Speaker 0: We're gonna have every single story be lame for the entire day.

133
00:08:38,792 --> 00:08:44,270
Speaker 0: But then what could we do to stand out from the crowd to be different and better than everyone else on the internet?

134
00:08:44,611 --> 00:08:55,690
Speaker 0: The answer is to not only shun April Fool's Day and not actually do anything for it But to to take a more intellectual standpoint and make fun of all the people who buy into this BS.

135
00:08:56,472 --> 00:08:56,652
Speaker 1: Yep,

136
00:08:57,153 --> 00:09:10,890
Speaker 0: even though my sad reality is that I love April Fool's Day and every year of my life where April Fool's Day fell On a Saturday or Sunday I Was really sad that year because I wanted to be at school or at work to do whatever I was gonna do that day.

137
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:13,879
Speaker 1: The thing is my past two April Fool's Days, right?

138
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:21,230
Speaker 1: It would be April Fool's when I had a new job And or April Fool's and I was working in the middle of nowhere.

139
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, your first day on the job will be cushioned under the CEOs chair.

140
00:09:24,141 --> 00:09:26,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like at my work.

141
00:09:26,409 --> 00:09:31,746
Speaker 1: now I mean, let's say I was at work today on April Fool's Day and I couldn't really.

142
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,776
Speaker 1: I don't know if I'd be comfortable pulling A prank on people.

143
00:09:33,796 --> 00:09:35,529
Speaker 1: I've only been at work with for a few weeks.

144
00:09:36,395 --> 00:09:37,723
Speaker 1: You know, I'd have to next year.

145
00:09:38,025 --> 00:09:51,850
Speaker 0: almost definitely I think I might be comfortable pranking some people but not now see the pranks at IBM usually just involved filling someone's office with Various items so they couldn't get into it or one time we replaced a guy's monitor cable with a busted monitor cable.

146
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,909
Speaker 0: So it worked but only yellow came through.

147
00:09:57,075 --> 00:10:01,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta replace like computer mice with ball mice Or there's always out.

148
00:10:01,295 --> 00:10:10,624
Speaker 0: there's always the obvious thing like we take an Ethernet cable cut off the end stick an antenna on it and instead stick it in a guy's computer and say yeah, we finally got you that wireless upgrade you've been asking for.

149
00:10:10,885 --> 00:10:13,997
Speaker 1: take a Some a screenshot of someone's desktop.

150
00:10:14,278 --> 00:10:17,290
Speaker 1: Ah make it their wallpaper and delete all their icons.

151
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:23,788
Speaker 0: That's so beautiful, except it doesn't work on rim Sean who types window key are or all space and then gets to work.

152
00:10:24,049 --> 00:10:36,209
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, actually though someone did that to a guy at my work at IBM back in the day And the guy was really old and he's smart, but he's not doesn't know about computers and he didn't know how to deal with that at all.

153
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:41,229
Speaker 1: And he was actually a program you can download now where you just run it and it does it.

154
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:48,933
Speaker 1: Wow, you don't need to go through the effort anymore of actually knowing how to take a screenshot or saving it and sending it As wallpaper or anything.

155
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:55,890
Speaker 0: Wow now couple that with some sort of time dependent logic bomb and you could hold a large organization hostage probably.

156
00:10:57,571 --> 00:11:00,969
Speaker 0: Anyway in the news, I have no segue at all for that.

157
00:11:02,012 --> 00:11:03,075
Speaker 0: You might remember I. can.

158
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:08,146
Speaker 0: they as far as you are all concerned regulate DNS names on the internet.

159
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:14,904
Speaker 1: It's the International consortium of Assholes and names and numbers.

160
00:11:14,985 --> 00:11:15,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't remember.

161
00:11:16,091 --> 00:11:18,027
Speaker 1: It doesn't sign names and numbers.

162
00:11:18,128 --> 00:11:19,937
Speaker 0: Yes Something like that.

163
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:20,602
Speaker 1: I forget.

164
00:11:20,864 --> 00:11:21,530
Speaker 0: we're awesome.

165
00:11:22,334 --> 00:11:25,270
Speaker 0: It's kind of like when you interviewed for Google and we know a lot about computers.

166
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,310
Speaker 0: But if you ask us something that we would have learned in school in a textbook, we don't know.

167
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:30,925
Speaker 0: I don't remember the I don't know.

168
00:11:31,973 --> 00:11:34,527
Speaker 1: It's the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers.

169
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:35,050
Speaker 0: outstanding.

170
00:11:35,271 --> 00:11:42,510
Speaker 0: Anyway, every now and then a bunch of people decide that we should have a dot xxx domain and it's always two groups of people.

171
00:11:42,813 --> 00:11:49,490
Speaker 0: It's always the crazy Radical fundamentalist religious types who want to segregate all the porn on the internet into one place.

172
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:54,710
Speaker 0: They can easily block it and on the other side you have all the porn people who want a porn domains.

173
00:11:54,771 --> 00:11:56,689
Speaker 0: They can have porn domain names.

174
00:11:57,022 --> 00:11:59,069
Speaker 1: Yeah Now keep in mind the porn people.

175
00:11:59,632 --> 00:12:04,690
Speaker 1: The difference here is that they want an xxx so that it's real easy for people to find porn.

176
00:12:05,011 --> 00:12:12,360
Speaker 1: But they have no intention of giving up their existing dot-com porn addresses They're gonna keep those to the Christians.

177
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:19,370
Speaker 1: Of course want it to make it somehow illegal for Porn to be in dot-com net org or anything.

178
00:12:19,454 --> 00:12:29,203
Speaker 0: Yeah They seem to have this fantasy that if we make a dot xxx domain we can force Everything objectionable on the internet to be there and not accessible any other way.

179
00:12:29,504 --> 00:12:34,358
Speaker 0: that way all the net nanny and the nets Whatever's can block the dot xxx.

180
00:12:34,378 --> 00:12:35,562
Speaker 1: You won't even need a software.

181
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:36,304
Speaker 1: It'll just work.

182
00:12:36,565 --> 00:12:37,870
Speaker 1: Just be like a click check up.

183
00:12:38,151 --> 00:12:38,933
Speaker 1: No xxx is.

184
00:12:39,495 --> 00:12:40,799
Speaker 0: I don't think I need to explain why.

185
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:50,669
Speaker 0: that is an absolutely ludicrous crazy stupid pathetic Horrible idea that only a moron could dream of not only morally and legally and constitutionally, but also technologically.

186
00:12:50,729 --> 00:12:54,190
Speaker 0: Yes Technologically impossible never mind the fact that it.

187
00:12:55,251 --> 00:13:01,527
Speaker 0: Anyway, the I can for all their problems are very smart and they have yet again rejected this idea.

188
00:13:01,928 --> 00:13:04,363
Speaker 1: That is good I guess in a way is he?

189
00:13:04,545 --> 00:13:05,250
Speaker 1: on the one hand?

190
00:13:05,671 --> 00:13:17,426
Speaker 1: I would like for there to be a lot more top-level domains each handled by more people because really We could use some more things besides com net org biz u.s.

191
00:13:17,647 --> 00:13:18,028
Speaker 1: Etc.

192
00:13:18,048 --> 00:13:21,639
Speaker 0: See, I don't know I disagree a little bit cuz right now the way the internet is right.

193
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:24,407
Speaker 0: we had com edu gov int.

194
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:25,490
Speaker 0: or all those things.

195
00:13:26,276 --> 00:13:27,909
Speaker 0: When biz was Kate was made.

196
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:35,794
Speaker 0: You pretty much know if you go to a website that ends in dot biz that it's either something really shady or a company that Doesn't know anything about the internet.

197
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:40,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, so pretty much top-level domains don't gain acceptance at all among anyone.

198
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:47,170
Speaker 1: That's true, but I think there could be a few awesome ones plus someone can make a lot of money selling them to people.

199
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:54,469
Speaker 1: For example, let's say you let Google have dot goog or you had you let Wikipedia have dot wiki or something like that.

200
00:13:55,071 --> 00:13:58,429
Speaker 1: You could really milk them for some cash and they would love it.

201
00:13:58,911 --> 00:14:04,920
Speaker 0: Well, the other problem is having more top-level domains really defeats the purpose of why DNS is the way it is and why it?

202
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,770
Speaker 1: It does it does in fact all the people.

203
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,960
Speaker 0: really you shouldn't even be using something.com.

204
00:14:12,421 --> 00:14:18,786
Speaker 0: it should be something dot something dot something dot something dot com and it should be segregated based on content and location and all this stuff.

205
00:14:19,337 --> 00:14:25,200
Speaker 0: and It was that way for a short time and then people who didn't know or care about the way DNS was supposed to be used.

206
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,530
Speaker 1: Do we do a DNS episode?

207
00:14:26,550 --> 00:14:27,397
Speaker 0: I don't know.

208
00:14:27,437 --> 00:14:31,590
Speaker 0: if we did it We're doing a DNS episode as soon as is convenient.

209
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,220
Speaker 0: and if we already did one then we're not because we already did one.

210
00:14:34,421 --> 00:14:38,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless maybe we could do one if we did the history do the technical side.

211
00:14:38,054 --> 00:14:40,725
Speaker 0: if we did the technical side do the history I'm pretty sure we haven't done one.

212
00:14:40,806 --> 00:14:41,408
Speaker 1: So we're doing it.

213
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:42,854
Speaker 0: Yeah, regardless.

214
00:14:43,256 --> 00:14:44,140
Speaker 0: It's a bad idea.

215
00:14:44,602 --> 00:14:48,315
Speaker 0: I can't agree at least nine people and I can't agree if I voted for it.

216
00:14:49,239 --> 00:14:49,862
Speaker 1: Ah Good.

217
00:14:50,647 --> 00:14:51,976
Speaker 1: All right, so we're at the grocery store.

218
00:14:51,996 --> 00:14:56,740
Speaker 1: the other day and You know, remember we told you the story about how he found the koalas at the grocery store.

219
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:59,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, the grocery store seemed to be realigning all of its content.

220
00:14:59,994 --> 00:15:01,340
Speaker 0: So we found a bunch of little gems.

221
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:05,633
Speaker 1: Yes, well there is one section in the grocery store that has sort of weird things.

222
00:15:05,653 --> 00:15:06,836
Speaker 1: they have British candy.

223
00:15:07,298 --> 00:15:10,360
Speaker 1: they have You know, it's next to the Goya stuff.

224
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:10,581
Speaker 1: It's.

225
00:15:10,721 --> 00:15:16,039
Speaker 1: it's all sorts of weird beverages and things that very few people want very niche products.

226
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:17,666
Speaker 0: granted I like a lot of that stuff.

227
00:15:17,886 --> 00:15:24,834
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and they had a beverage called ribena R I B E N A ribena black current.

228
00:15:25,255 --> 00:15:26,299
Speaker 1: black current is one word.

229
00:15:26,781 --> 00:15:29,709
Speaker 1: Yes, basically what it is is black current juice.

230
00:15:30,110 --> 00:15:35,365
Speaker 1: now black current is sort of like it's like a berry Raisin kind of thing.

231
00:15:35,385 --> 00:15:42,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a long and cool history about black currents and odd for various reasons They weren't allowed to be grown in the US for a long time.

232
00:15:42,742 --> 00:15:53,620
Speaker 1: Yes The black currents were illegal to grow in the US because they were responsible for spreading this tree disease That would have damaged the lumber industry and the lumber industry was more important than the black current industry.

233
00:15:54,101 --> 00:16:02,668
Speaker 1: But eventually the right the law was returned to state jurisdiction and a lot of states in the Northeast like New York and such Have real loud black current growing.

234
00:16:02,749 --> 00:16:05,300
Speaker 0: now, of course, this is America for all of you British listeners.

235
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:12,620
Speaker 0: I'm sure you're well aware of black currents because they became very popular there Apparently during World War two when it was difficult to get oranges into the islands.

236
00:16:13,022 --> 00:16:20,731
Speaker 1: Yes, also they use black currents to flavor vodak in Russia a lot And the name black curtain actually comes from.

237
00:16:21,233 --> 00:16:23,680
Speaker 1: it's like raisin of Corinth because you know Corinth.

238
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what black currents are outstanding.

239
00:16:27,028 --> 00:16:31,500
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, this beverage rubenna is made of black currant juice.

240
00:16:31,981 --> 00:16:38,180
Speaker 1: Wait and the company that makes it is like a subsidiary of Glaxo Smith Klein, which is that pharmaceutical company?

241
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:44,420
Speaker 0: You know now I had never heard of this drink or anything about it until there was all that news on Fark a while.

242
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:47,773
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hadn't heard of rubana black currents or anything.

243
00:16:47,813 --> 00:16:49,579
Speaker 1: I'd heard of Glaxo Smith Klein, but that's it.

244
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,190
Speaker 0: See I knew about black currents because there's black current.

245
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:53,034
Speaker 1: I've heard of currents.

246
00:16:53,255 --> 00:16:53,958
Speaker 0: There's black current.

247
00:16:53,978 --> 00:16:54,951
Speaker 0: a lot of the wines I like.

248
00:16:55,054 --> 00:16:55,177
Speaker 0: yeah.

249
00:16:55,782 --> 00:17:09,104
Speaker 1: Anyway, some girls in New Zealand were doing a science fair project and their science fair project was pretty much Hey, let's test a bunch of different drinks for vitamin C. So they went to the grocery store and they said oh Here's some orange juice.

250
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:10,268
Speaker 1: Here's some apple juice.

251
00:17:10,529 --> 00:17:11,332
Speaker 1: Here's some water.

252
00:17:11,352 --> 00:17:12,517
Speaker 1: Here's some soda.

253
00:17:12,537 --> 00:17:13,420
Speaker 1: Here's some.

254
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:20,343
Speaker 1: Oh this black currant juice says on it that it has a whole lot of vitamin C a lot In fact.

255
00:17:20,384 --> 00:17:26,969
Speaker 0: in some areas, it looks like they marketed as made with black currants Which contain X percent more vitamin C than oranges.

256
00:17:27,190 --> 00:17:32,409
Speaker 1: black currents do contain a lot of fucking vitamin C too bad They weren't putting those black currents in the drink.

257
00:17:32,891 --> 00:17:34,920
Speaker 1: Well, they were putting black currents in the drink.

258
00:17:35,121 --> 00:17:38,180
Speaker 1: The problem is the vitamin C wasn't making it into the drink.

259
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:50,919
Speaker 0: Yeah what they were doing is they put like four or five percent black currant juice in the drink and then the rest of it was Processed concentrate and a byproduct of the processing was that it destroyed or removed just about all of the vitamin C.

260
00:17:51,270 --> 00:18:00,780
Speaker 1: Yeah So these two girls in New Zealand doing a completely innocent science fair project Didn't detect any vitamin C in these supposedly high vitamin C rubenna.

261
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:08,845
Speaker 1: So they said something to the company and they said hey, there's no vitamin C and in this drink now This was years ago.

262
00:18:09,286 --> 00:18:13,079
Speaker 0: Yep, and the company said what are you gonna do about it?

263
00:18:14,461 --> 00:18:24,327
Speaker 1: So they went to a TV station and now there's news about these girls everywhere and it just shows you that companies lie and Science is real.

264
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:34,300
Speaker 0: just recently the company Pleaded guilty to all 15 charges that were filed against them and they were fined like two hundred thousand New Zealand dollars so far.

265
00:18:34,962 --> 00:18:40,820
Speaker 1: Well, I saw rubetta in the store the other day and it did make many claims about vitamin C that are apparently not true.

266
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:52,079
Speaker 0: Even better Apparently they have been forced to purchase a great number of full page and half page advertisements in popular newspapers Apologizing for what they did and explaining what was wrong.

267
00:18:53,161 --> 00:19:00,326
Speaker 1: They should be forced to like put things on the internet forever and such, you know, there's a useless newspaper I don't think the word is looking at.

268
00:19:00,366 --> 00:19:03,260
Speaker 0: I don't think the word internet in the word forever can ever coexist.

269
00:19:04,084 --> 00:19:12,600
Speaker 1: Also TV commercials might be good perhaps youtubes Anything just newspapers alone isn't good enough these days because only old people will find out about it.

270
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:16,940
Speaker 0: But the thing is all the people who aren't old found out about it already on the internet.

271
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:27,080
Speaker 0: the only people who aren't gonna know about this are the middle gap the gap between the old people who don't know about the Internet and us and frankly those people don't matter in the grand scheme of things anymore.

272
00:19:27,441 --> 00:19:35,620
Speaker 1: Well, if you want vitamin C don't drink rubenna, but if you like black currants Ruben it might still be good for you if you want to drink that.

273
00:19:36,001 --> 00:19:43,931
Speaker 0: Well, I really like black currants and I would say just in terms of promoting honesty in corporations I really like black currants and I like black currant juice.

274
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:45,800
Speaker 0: I would never buy rubenna.

275
00:19:45,921 --> 00:19:52,420
Speaker 0: I'll buy some other black currant juice and it looks like black currants are on the upswing So they're probably gonna be a lot of competitors in the near future.

276
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:56,996
Speaker 0: Alrighty, especially since pomegranate juice is starting to take off more and more and it used to be.

277
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:58,040
Speaker 0: you could just get those little palm.

278
00:19:58,242 --> 00:19:59,620
Speaker 0: I like them but they were expensive.

279
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,240
Speaker 0: I just bought a giant jug of pomegranate juice for very little money.

280
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:08,866
Speaker 1: The thing that upsets me though is, you know, while pomegranate juice is on the up actual pomegranates are not.

281
00:20:09,147 --> 00:20:14,093
Speaker 0: I don't think it's so easy to get them in the best of Quality to the United States.

282
00:20:14,174 --> 00:20:15,000
Speaker 1: I think that is correct.

283
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:19,340
Speaker 1: But when I went to Israel, I ate a pomegranate and it's sort of weird because you open it.

284
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,026
Speaker 1: It's all brainy and slimy.

285
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:24,700
Speaker 0: I was about to say it's like eating a brain is but it's damn good.

286
00:20:25,383 --> 00:20:36,916
Speaker 1: If I could buy pomegranates I would but I don't see any at the grocery store things of the day.

287
00:20:37,358 --> 00:20:46,036
Speaker 0: so I found this video that is basically an ad for a 1955 car and There are two cool things about this ad.

288
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:49,808
Speaker 0: one the primary selling point of this car.

289
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:56,850
Speaker 1: Is that it has Air-conditioning and heat and heat and they actually call it all season air-conditioning.

290
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:01,510
Speaker 0: Turn the knob to the left turn the knob to the right no matter what whether you're driving and it's gonna be great.

291
00:21:02,352 --> 00:21:03,850
Speaker 1: That's pretty crazy that you know.

292
00:21:03,870 --> 00:21:11,658
Speaker 1: I always thought about that because they know a model T doesn't have air conditioning or heating or anything and I always wondered like What were the first cars to have air conditioning?

293
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:12,763
Speaker 1: How did it work?

294
00:21:13,164 --> 00:21:14,610
Speaker 1: What were the first cars to have heat?

295
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,157
Speaker 1: How did it work, you know.

296
00:21:16,197 --> 00:21:18,690
Speaker 1: and all that because now every car is air conditioning and heat.

297
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:21,488
Speaker 1: You pretty much can't get a car without air conditioning and heat.

298
00:21:21,689 --> 00:21:25,090
Speaker 0: Yep Well, my laser didn't have air conditioning, but it was air conditioning ready.

299
00:21:25,251 --> 00:21:25,655
Speaker 0: It had.

300
00:21:25,675 --> 00:21:27,290
Speaker 0: it was set up to take air conditioning.

301
00:21:27,392 --> 00:21:28,087
Speaker 0: It just didn't have it.

302
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:34,401
Speaker 0: Hmm because the rice who had the car before me chose not to get air conditioning because he was afraid they would put too much Heat into his delicate system.

303
00:21:35,107 --> 00:21:41,130
Speaker 0: Oh And my son fire currently no longer has air conditioning, but it's also leaking coolant and oil.

304
00:21:41,576 --> 00:21:42,450
Speaker 0: So yeah.

305
00:21:43,072 --> 00:21:49,811
Speaker 0: But the other cool thing about this is that the character that is selling this car to you is no other than Brer Rabbit.

306
00:21:50,032 --> 00:21:57,825
Speaker 0: Brer rabbit the racist Brer rabbit from the uncle Remus stories derived from African American folk tales in the southern United States.

307
00:21:59,413 --> 00:22:06,490
Speaker 0: Now you might remember Brer rabbit from a bunch of stories and picture books But also from the famous movie entitled the song of the south.

308
00:22:07,012 --> 00:22:09,643
Speaker 1: I always wanted to see song of the south never seen it.

309
00:22:10,186 --> 00:22:10,929
Speaker 1: I saw parts of.

310
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:13,650
Speaker 1: okay I never saw the whole thing at once like somewhere.

311
00:22:13,891 --> 00:22:18,410
Speaker 0: My mom has a tape of it because I remember we bought it and we watched it and I really liked it as a kid.

312
00:22:18,711 --> 00:22:27,606
Speaker 1: It's a good movie, but it is a racist movie and therefore Disney has not Printed it on DVD or VHS or anything in a long time now.

313
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:31,730
Speaker 0: granted there was a rumor I don't know if I talked about on the show that it was gonna come out on DVD eventually.

314
00:22:31,871 --> 00:22:32,232
Speaker 0: I saw it.

315
00:22:32,272 --> 00:22:34,301
Speaker 1: didn't we see a Netflix pre-release or something?

316
00:22:34,321 --> 00:22:36,470
Speaker 0: there was an Amazon pre-release that you couldn't order.

317
00:22:36,751 --> 00:22:37,757
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's still there.

318
00:22:37,817 --> 00:22:40,130
Speaker 1: I'm gonna look for it right now in our Netflix queue.

319
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:42,737
Speaker 0: It's still pending so it's definitely not out yet.

320
00:22:43,118 --> 00:22:54,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't see the Disney movie available on Amazon anywhere although I do see the adventures of bray rabbit 2006 which looks like a really crappy Directed DVD kids movie.

321
00:22:54,216 --> 00:22:58,410
Speaker 1: that is nothing to do with song of the south other than the character of bray rabbit.

322
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:04,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, I thought this was kind of cool cuz I remember growing up as a kid reading a little bray rabbit stories.

323
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,609
Speaker 0: I wonder if I still have those books.

324
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:06,958
Speaker 1: I had one of those.

325
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:15,681
Speaker 1: I had a fisher-price tape recorder and it would come with a book and a tape and you could put the tape in and read the book at the same time and I had a bray rabbit one of those.

326
00:23:15,903 --> 00:23:20,443
Speaker 1: not it was pretty good Alright, so there are a lot of forms of entertainment.

327
00:23:20,664 --> 00:23:26,450
Speaker 1: You know out there in the world But you know vaudeville sideshow type things that aren't really popular today.

328
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:29,770
Speaker 1: I mean no one really likes to see a hypnotist so much.

329
00:23:29,890 --> 00:23:36,257
Speaker 1: You know hypnotist is sort of like you might get him to do a bar mitzvah or a small party But God you know.

330
00:23:36,277 --> 00:23:44,230
Speaker 0: there was a hypnotist at my high school all night senior party Yeah, and the guy was probably the second lamest thing I've ever seen in my life.

331
00:23:44,672 --> 00:23:48,750
Speaker 1: You know all sorts of lame acts out there and ventriloquism is one of those lame acts.

332
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,959
Speaker 1: It's like no one wants to see a ventriloquist.

333
00:23:51,019 --> 00:23:58,108
Speaker 1: I mean you know it's just a joke like gabbo Gabbo gabbo gabbo right it's like a ventriloquist.

334
00:23:58,149 --> 00:23:58,871
Speaker 1: great And why?

335
00:23:59,252 --> 00:24:00,055
Speaker 1: but the reason it.

336
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:00,797
Speaker 1: the thing is.

337
00:24:01,259 --> 00:24:04,750
Speaker 1: back in the day ventriloquists are popular and with good reason.

338
00:24:05,192 --> 00:24:08,209
Speaker 1: It was actually funny that people went to see them.

339
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:09,219
Speaker 1: It wasn't like.

340
00:24:09,562 --> 00:24:16,288
Speaker 1: there was always Ventriloquism and people did it and no one liked it and people continued to do it just because they wanted to it.

341
00:24:16,992 --> 00:24:22,662
Speaker 1: ventriloquism can actually be entertaining and Here is a great example of modern ventriloquism.

342
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,510
Speaker 1: That is pretty entertaining.

343
00:24:25,112 --> 00:24:30,970
Speaker 1: I don't know when this is from but it must be recently and it's some event called tickled pink.

344
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:36,264
Speaker 1: That's taking place at Royal Albert Hall Which is sort of like Carnegie Hall in the UK or Albion.

345
00:24:37,027 --> 00:24:37,750
Speaker 1: and this girl?

346
00:24:37,970 --> 00:24:39,801
Speaker 1: She's pretty cute named Nina Conti.

347
00:24:40,263 --> 00:24:41,370
Speaker 1: She does ventriloquism.

348
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:52,672
Speaker 1: She has a little monkey puppet, and it's pretty funny because the monkeys all acknowledging that it's just a puppet and It's it's pretty dirty It's.

349
00:24:53,113 --> 00:24:55,162
Speaker 1: I laughed a lot when I watch this even though.

350
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:56,267
Speaker 1: It's just a ventriloquist.

351
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:56,668
Speaker 0: It's good.

352
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:57,050
Speaker 0: It's good.

353
00:24:57,351 --> 00:25:00,630
Speaker 0: It's definitely funnier than the ventriloquist in the second Phoenix Wright game.

354
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:07,517
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ventriloquist in the second Phoenix Wright game is just Stereotypically sad ventriloquist.

355
00:25:07,778 --> 00:25:09,986
Speaker 0: Yes sad ventriloquist.

356
00:25:10,287 --> 00:25:13,640
Speaker 1: and I noticed on YouTube There's a bunch of other links to videos with this girl.

357
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:14,705
Speaker 1: I might watch some of them.

358
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:15,829
Speaker 1: Maybe she tells different jokes.

359
00:25:16,911 --> 00:25:24,324
Speaker 0: So April Fool's Day, it's here and every year It seems for pretty much as long as I have known that there was a site called slash dot.

360
00:25:24,665 --> 00:25:29,330
Speaker 0: There's always this Pseudo Controversy about April Fool's Day.

361
00:25:29,852 --> 00:25:30,735
Speaker 0: I mean every year.

362
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:35,030
Speaker 0: slash dot is the same tradition all day from midnight until midnight.

363
00:25:35,532 --> 00:25:40,510
Speaker 0: Every single story on slash dot will be ludicrously ludicrously false.

364
00:25:41,072 --> 00:25:43,219
Speaker 1: Yes, and you know, it's sort of like.

365
00:25:43,479 --> 00:25:46,670
Speaker 1: it's not funny because you read it and they're not fooling you.

366
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:49,823
Speaker 1: You know that the stories are fake and you're kind of pissed.

367
00:25:49,863 --> 00:25:51,610
Speaker 1: because what if real news happens today?

368
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:54,927
Speaker 1: You got to go to a different site to find it because you're not gonna find it here.

369
00:25:54,947 --> 00:25:58,830
Speaker 0: now It's not an issue anymore because now we have Google News and dig and all that.

370
00:25:59,151 --> 00:26:03,286
Speaker 0: But imagine a time before dig and you wanted to know.

371
00:26:03,306 --> 00:26:07,867
Speaker 0: it's like say we were doing the show I don't know four years ago, and we needed tech news and it was April 1st.

372
00:26:08,570 --> 00:26:09,856
Speaker 1: What the fuck are we gonna do?

373
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:11,321
Speaker 1: We go to seen it.

374
00:26:11,522 --> 00:26:17,488
Speaker 0: zd net or slash that Yeah, and slash dot is basically broken for 24 hours.

375
00:26:17,749 --> 00:26:23,446
Speaker 0: granted I usually think they're not really funny in the April Fool's Way, but they're always funny in this onion kind of way.

376
00:26:23,466 --> 00:26:31,850
Speaker 1: I The thing is the onion is actually clever and witty whereas the slash dot is sort of ham-fisted and corny.

377
00:26:32,251 --> 00:26:37,409
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is it's not always ham-fisted and corny because usually they're drawing from what other people have done and linking to it.

378
00:26:38,352 --> 00:26:46,349
Speaker 1: Sometimes but sometimes not a lot of them are just people on April Fool's Day go to slash dot because it's slash That is all users submitted stories.

379
00:26:46,811 --> 00:26:57,930
Speaker 1: So people submit you know stuff and then I guess the editors at slash dot pick which ones are worthy of being posted on April Fool's Day, but the thing is all those things are usually jokes that other people had on their sites.

380
00:26:57,970 --> 00:27:03,236
Speaker 0: There are no original jokes on slash dot other than this year where well I mean, I guess they've done things before but I never noticed.

381
00:27:03,256 --> 00:27:10,423
Speaker 0: but this year due to mostly the rivalry between dig and slash dot Slash dot added dig dot which is very much.

382
00:27:10,443 --> 00:27:20,923
Speaker 1: They added a slash dot it Yes side there, which like rim said, uh last night, you know rim said, uh slash dot put their April Fool's up And I'm like they put digs did there didn't they?

383
00:27:21,164 --> 00:27:22,330
Speaker 1: and rims like yeah, they did.

384
00:27:22,813 --> 00:27:25,228
Speaker 1: I didn't have to look at the site and I knew what they had done already.

385
00:27:25,248 --> 00:27:35,416
Speaker 0: now However, when you click on it The text that is given is probably the best indicator of the different philosophies in Content between dig and slash dot.

386
00:27:35,797 --> 00:27:44,585
Speaker 0: your vote in the slash dotted system will help ensure the best stories are presented to our readers with hyper accurate numbers to indicate their relevance relevance and general awesomeness.

387
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:48,498
Speaker 0: only by requiring the Contribution of every random user of the internet.

388
00:27:48,518 --> 00:27:51,770
Speaker 0: Can we guarantee the most scientifically perfect numbers will be generated?

389
00:27:52,590 --> 00:27:55,602
Speaker 1: Yep, that describes dig pretty well.

390
00:27:55,663 --> 00:27:57,310
Speaker 0: vote early vote often.

391
00:27:59,891 --> 00:28:04,867
Speaker 0: Now luckily dig you can't vote often unless you're a gigantic tool and you put a lot more effort into within.

392
00:28:04,927 --> 00:28:08,339
Speaker 0: any human being would Which you think wouldn't be an issue yet.

393
00:28:08,942 --> 00:28:10,287
Speaker 0: I bury there.

394
00:28:10,548 --> 00:28:26,570
Speaker 0: Ah Usually if I see a story that's dug up stupidly and I look at who dug it I'll find that there are a lot of accounts who seem to exist solely to dig stories from spam sites And I'll usually spend about 10 minutes systematically burying everything those users have ever posted and everything any friend of theirs has ever posted.

395
00:28:27,251 --> 00:28:29,602
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why you got mistaken for the berry Brigade.

396
00:28:29,622 --> 00:28:34,121
Speaker 0: because I am a member of the berry Brigade I very dedicatedly bury things on dig.

397
00:28:34,201 --> 00:28:36,530
Speaker 0: I probably bury 10 stories for every story I dig.

398
00:28:37,311 --> 00:28:40,864
Speaker 1: Yeah, you should bury all the April Fool's Day fake stories.

399
00:28:40,944 --> 00:28:42,450
Speaker 1: that because you only want real stories.

400
00:28:42,610 --> 00:28:43,675
Speaker 0: No, because I don't really care.

401
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:46,024
Speaker 0: I actually kind of enjoy the April Fool's Day stories.

402
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,530
Speaker 0: See the thing is about slash dot.

403
00:28:48,158 --> 00:28:49,030
Speaker 0: That's not the story.

404
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,797
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter that slash dot does this.

405
00:28:50,877 --> 00:28:57,995
Speaker 0: every website does something except geek nights because we're above the fray but on slash dot Every year.

406
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:02,190
Speaker 0: it's like people don't see it coming and they don't remember that it happened the previous year.

407
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:11,190
Speaker 0: so the first story goes up and There's always a bunch of comments of people reacting in shock as to the news like the DMCA was repealed.

408
00:29:11,611 --> 00:29:14,941
Speaker 0: OMG this is the best news ever blah blah.

409
00:29:15,142 --> 00:29:17,168
Speaker 0: and then finally someone wait a minute.

410
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,949
Speaker 0: Oh Wow, those morons fell for it.

411
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,214
Speaker 0: Happy April Fool's Day.

412
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:32,997
Speaker 0: and then in every single thread for the rest of the day It'll be half the people talking about how funny the joke is or playing along with the joke and half the people Bitching about how slash dot is useless.

413
00:29:33,037 --> 00:29:38,075
Speaker 0: now these stories aren't funny and they put more effort into bitching that they could have just not Read slash dot for a day.

414
00:29:38,497 --> 00:29:43,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, actually there was one really good April Fool's Day last year board game geek.

415
00:29:43,643 --> 00:29:44,990
Speaker 1: They actually got me.

416
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,054
Speaker 1: I was totally punned.

417
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:47,097
Speaker 1: they on.

418
00:29:47,137 --> 00:29:58,403
Speaker 1: you went to the site and it sort of logged you in as an administrator or it looked like it and you had all these controls there and you're like They broke the site and I'm logged in as administrator.

419
00:29:58,423 --> 00:30:00,410
Speaker 1: I so I went to the board.

420
00:30:00,831 --> 00:30:04,763
Speaker 1: I sent them an email like hey your sites broken you should.

421
00:30:04,863 --> 00:30:05,646
Speaker 1: you should fix that.

422
00:30:06,007 --> 00:30:08,926
Speaker 1: and then I Went back and I was like don't?

423
00:30:10,871 --> 00:30:14,484
Speaker 1: Because it was so convincing it was actually fooling you it wasn't?

424
00:30:14,585 --> 00:30:15,990
Speaker 1: you know some ham-fisted thing?

425
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:16,251
Speaker 1: It was.

426
00:30:16,352 --> 00:30:20,290
Speaker 1: it looked like the administrator login page in every single possible way.

427
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:30,390
Speaker 0: Fark did that actually almost the exact same way except the admin page They gave you looked like a straight-up admin page Like you could just bury things or blah blah blah and had all these secret options.

428
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:43,250
Speaker 0: but if you looked at it for more than a few seconds you realize that one it had total for our total FARC and ultra FARC stuff and Everyone knows that ultra FARC doesn't exist because anyone who knows about it and talks about it is summarily executed.

429
00:30:43,892 --> 00:30:49,390
Speaker 0: Ah, and two you started noticing that a lot of the options didn't really make sense at all.

430
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:55,388
Speaker 1: Yeah See the thing is I was too good and I didn't actually bother to try to use the administrator interface.

431
00:30:55,448 --> 00:30:57,529
Speaker 1: if I did I would Have gotten the haha message.

432
00:30:58,112 --> 00:30:59,297
Speaker 0: The thing is the FARC one.

433
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:02,029
Speaker 0: if you didn't notice all the dummy entries you tried to use it.

434
00:31:02,391 --> 00:31:06,070
Speaker 0: You thought it was working for a while because it wasn't easy to tell immediately if it worked.

435
00:31:07,472 --> 00:31:09,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the thing is a lot of people.

436
00:31:09,961 --> 00:31:11,125
Speaker 1: it's April Fool's Day.

437
00:31:11,165 --> 00:31:16,202
Speaker 1: so people just do something Wacky instead of actually fooling anyone.

438
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:21,143
Speaker 1: and I really the wacky stuff That's so forced and a non-subtle.

439
00:31:21,464 --> 00:31:22,609
Speaker 1: It just doesn't do it for me.

440
00:31:22,871 --> 00:31:29,725
Speaker 0: See I very much I don't like the April Fool Fool part in the media Because I don't like the media to lie to me one day out of the year.

441
00:31:29,745 --> 00:31:30,910
Speaker 1: I mean, what is true?

442
00:31:31,210 --> 00:31:35,330
Speaker 0: What if the next 9/11 and Hiroshima happened today?

443
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:36,153
Speaker 0: Huh?

444
00:31:36,415 --> 00:31:38,765
Speaker 0: No matter who told me I would have said what yeah, right.

445
00:31:38,966 --> 00:31:39,810
Speaker 0: what yeah, right?

446
00:31:40,050 --> 00:31:41,861
Speaker 0: And it would have taken me a while to realize that.

447
00:31:41,901 --> 00:31:42,424
Speaker 0: wait a minute.

448
00:31:42,867 --> 00:31:43,209
Speaker 1: Yeah.

449
00:31:43,309 --> 00:31:47,408
Speaker 1: Yeah I definitely agree that you know, the news shouldn't be doing fake stuff.

450
00:31:47,428 --> 00:31:48,091
Speaker 1: the news You just.

451
00:31:48,493 --> 00:31:53,310
Speaker 1: it's not that important that everyone should just be silly for everything.

452
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,315
Speaker 1: You know something.

453
00:31:54,375 --> 00:31:56,506
Speaker 1: the news is more important than April Fool's Day.

454
00:31:56,606 --> 00:31:57,330
Speaker 1: It's no big deal.

455
00:31:57,350 --> 00:32:09,820
Speaker 0: The only kind of foolings I like are the things like if Scientific American on their April first issue Happen to have an entirely fake thing about an entirely fake thing Like the old spaghetti tree harvests.

456
00:32:10,663 --> 00:32:12,430
Speaker 1: see fake things like that are okay.

457
00:32:12,953 --> 00:32:17,716
Speaker 1: The thing for me is that when they're so obviously fake It's just not funny.

458
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:19,824
Speaker 0: but people fell for the spaghetti tree one.

459
00:32:19,945 --> 00:32:23,550
Speaker 1: a lot of people that Might have fell for it back in the day as well?

460
00:32:23,631 --> 00:32:25,671
Speaker 1: I don't know but you know I'm not saying.

461
00:32:25,892 --> 00:32:25,952
Speaker 1: are

462
00:32:25,992 --> 00:32:40,310
Speaker 0: you saying seriously that if someone showed you a documentary talking about the spaghetti trees of Italy and showed video in black and white of people from like the 1940s harvesting their spaghetti by hand before they came up with modern equipment and had this whole you would have believed

463
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:40,390
Speaker 1: it?

464
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:41,720
Speaker 1: It depends on a couple things.

465
00:32:41,761 --> 00:32:42,769
Speaker 1: It depends what year it is.

466
00:32:43,151 --> 00:32:47,990
Speaker 1: It depends how old I am because I did not know how spaghetti was made until I was maybe eight.

467
00:32:48,452 --> 00:32:52,289
Speaker 1: So if I was seven and you showed it to me, I'd be like, oh, that's what the spaghetti comes from.

468
00:32:53,512 --> 00:32:57,009
Speaker 1: But now that I know spaghetti is basically we put in a pasta maker.

469
00:32:58,052 --> 00:33:00,010
Speaker 1: So you're not gonna fool me with your spaghetti tree.

470
00:33:00,552 --> 00:33:18,047
Speaker 0: But very much more than the fooling because fooling is easy to do the more credulous your story is or the more subtle it Is it gets to the point where if you make it so subtle that it's this brilliant play and you'll fool everyone You fooled everyone and now no one realizes they were fooled and the thing you fooled them on is something They'll never even realize they were

471
00:33:18,067 --> 00:33:18,229
Speaker 1: wrong.

472
00:33:18,551 --> 00:33:19,133
Speaker 1: That is.

473
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:23,790
Speaker 1: the essential problem with April Fools on the internet is because April Fools in real life.

474
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:31,604
Speaker 1: You can go around being subtle and fooling people but then because you're right there you can go April Fools bitch.

475
00:33:31,785 --> 00:33:37,706
Speaker 1: Yeah But on the internet, that's really hard to do because where are you gonna put that?

476
00:33:37,746 --> 00:33:38,890
Speaker 1: Are you gonna post it later?

477
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:39,834
Speaker 1: They might not see it.

478
00:33:39,914 --> 00:33:41,620
Speaker 1: Are you gonna post it in the same article?

479
00:33:41,901 --> 00:33:45,615
Speaker 1: then they might see that before they get fooled What can you do?

480
00:33:45,735 --> 00:33:48,023
Speaker 0: you lose all the satisfaction of getting someone?

481
00:33:48,144 --> 00:33:49,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, you don't get to see their reaction of going.

482
00:33:50,934 --> 00:33:51,758
Speaker 1: I got fooled.

483
00:33:51,839 --> 00:33:53,024
Speaker 0: I mean plus if you're.

484
00:33:53,205 --> 00:34:00,530
Speaker 0: if you're subtle enough It doesn't become funny anymore because the I got Scott this morning with probably the lamest April Fool ever.

485
00:34:00,591 --> 00:34:02,830
Speaker 0: It was pretty lame mostly as a proof of concept.

486
00:34:03,211 --> 00:34:08,031
Speaker 0: All I did was convince him that we'd left the charcoal from when we grilled outside Which

487
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:13,085
Speaker 1: is absolutely believable because we grilled last night and I didn't bring the charcoal back in

488
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:16,257
Speaker 0: and that it had rained and made A big mess and ruined the deck and

489
00:34:16,297 --> 00:34:19,550
Speaker 1: which is believable because there was a slight chance of rain on the weather.

490
00:34:19,811 --> 00:34:24,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a perfectly believable April Fool and I got no satisfaction out of it whatsoever.

491
00:34:24,491 --> 00:34:28,170
Speaker 0: I should have come in and said Scott your mom just died, but then he wouldn't have believed me.

492
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,618
Speaker 1: No, I would have been like, oh right.

493
00:34:29,658 --> 00:34:30,483
Speaker 1: It's April Fool's Day.

494
00:34:30,704 --> 00:34:30,925
Speaker 0: Yeah.

495
00:34:30,945 --> 00:34:31,025
Speaker 0: Yeah.

496
00:34:32,250 --> 00:34:41,889
Speaker 0: Therefore I'm much more fan of nowadays of the April Fool's Day prank where I'm basically and this is actually This is how I did it all through high school, too.

497
00:34:41,909 --> 00:34:42,933
Speaker 0: I didn't try to fool people.

498
00:34:43,174 --> 00:34:49,141
Speaker 0: what I always did is I pulled pranks because if you fall for a prank on any given day It's no big deal.

499
00:34:49,161 --> 00:34:49,989
Speaker 0: you fell for a prank.

500
00:34:50,312 --> 00:34:53,949
Speaker 0: It's hard to not fall for a prank unless you see it coming or the people doing it or idiots.

501
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:57,490
Speaker 0: But on April Fool's Day everyone's guards a little bit up.

502
00:34:57,791 --> 00:35:03,170
Speaker 0: So if you can get someone on April Fool's Day with a well-constructed prank you sir are a god among men.

503
00:35:03,372 --> 00:35:15,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's just something about it Like, you know when someone says I'm gonna prank you and then you're on the lookout and they still get you It's like imagine if everyone was on high alert and you still manage to totally own someone.

504
00:35:16,226 --> 00:35:17,370
Speaker 1: It's like double power.

505
00:35:17,451 --> 00:35:29,840
Speaker 1: It's almost not worth it to prank someone in any other day because it's only normal prank power when the same exact effort could have gone into that same prank on April 1st and Gotten you 10 times the reward.

506
00:35:30,303 --> 00:35:34,950
Speaker 0: I had a friend in high school and One thing that he did is he had this all day.

507
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,970
Speaker 0: He came up to this other friend of mine and he said I'm gonna get you today and it was April Fool's Day.

508
00:35:40,111 --> 00:35:46,889
Speaker 0: It's April Fool's Day and all day He kept reminding the guy that it was April Fool's Day and that he was going to get him.

509
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,017
Speaker 1: Wow Did he get him?

510
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:59,105
Speaker 0: No, he didn't do anything But he didn't even try And that kid Jordan Jones was probably the most paranoid fucker.

511
00:35:59,165 --> 00:36:05,660
Speaker 0: I've seen in my entire life every time he saw the guy he'd be like Like he walked slow.

512
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:11,970
Speaker 0: every time we went to his locker He'd like he'd look at it to make sure that wasn't like Vaseline on it that we open it real carefully.

513
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:13,315
Speaker 0: He'd like open it.

514
00:36:13,356 --> 00:36:14,701
Speaker 1: He's staying that in a way.

515
00:36:14,741 --> 00:36:15,705
Speaker 1: That's the April Fool's.

516
00:36:15,765 --> 00:36:16,669
Speaker 1: it's I'm gonna get you.

517
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,333
Speaker 1: Just kidding April Fool's.

518
00:36:19,236 --> 00:36:22,725
Speaker 0: I was disappointed though because if he had been paranoid all day

519
00:36:23,006 --> 00:36:27,278
Speaker 1: and he had been gotten that would have been the sweetest cheesecake ever

520
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:35,366
Speaker 0: like the best thing in the world would have been if he came home at night and he gets in bed and then suddenly feels something turns around and Nathan's laying there next to him.

521
00:36:35,386 --> 00:36:35,650
Speaker 0: It's like.

522
00:36:38,753 --> 00:36:39,796
Speaker 0: I've know how that could have happened.

523
00:36:39,817 --> 00:36:51,159
Speaker 1: But yeah, April Fool's Day is generally sort of like, you know Sometimes we play in a game and it's like alright this turn it's plus one to gold and this turn it's plus one to settlers.

524
00:36:51,505 --> 00:36:55,369
Speaker 1: well April Fool's Day is basically plus ten to practical jokes all day.

525
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:59,969
Speaker 0: Actually, I'd say it's minus five to practical jokes because it's harder to pull them off.

526
00:37:00,411 --> 00:37:03,910
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's plus ten to the to your reward if you manage to pull them.

527
00:37:05,536 --> 00:37:12,044
Speaker 1: but at the same time Unsubtle corny ham-fisted things are just annoying that don't even bother.

528
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:13,849
Speaker 0: Hey Scott, there's a spider on you.

529
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:17,184
Speaker 0: Ha ha April Fool's made you look made you look.

530
00:37:17,405 --> 00:37:19,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, like for example Google did some.

531
00:37:19,754 --> 00:37:23,344
Speaker 1: well Google did something last year also, but this year they did.

532
00:37:23,364 --> 00:37:53,947
Speaker 1: I don't even I looked at it for like five Seconds cuz it wasn't funny, but they were basically like hey if you want Google's new awesome internet service provider Yeah, we just take this thing and tie it to a fiber optic cable and flush it down the toilet and then our Google guys will find your wire pick it up and plug it in and then attach this wireless adapter to the other end on top of your toilet and get super fast internet connection in your house and it's like Alright, you obviously made a page for April Fool's Day and it's not funny.

533
00:37:54,348 --> 00:37:59,061
Speaker 0: then again I've known some people who would probably fall in for that and I'm dead serious.

534
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,249
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, those people are just dumb.

535
00:38:01,489 --> 00:38:03,679
Speaker 0: Yeah The thing is that's the other thing.

536
00:38:04,061 --> 00:38:06,010
Speaker 0: getting a dumb person isn't funny at all.

537
00:38:06,232 --> 00:38:07,689
Speaker 0: You don't get any satisfaction out of that.

538
00:38:07,911 --> 00:38:09,035
Speaker 0: You gotta get someone smart.

539
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:13,070
Speaker 0: the smarter person the more prepared person the better the payoff.

540
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:17,930
Speaker 1: Yes, if someone is dumb, they probably don't even remember that it's April Fool's Day.

541
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:20,421
Speaker 1: they probably couldn't tell you which day April Fool's Day was.

542
00:38:20,883 --> 00:38:25,439
Speaker 1: they wouldn't have the Ability to even consider a prank.

543
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:33,709
Speaker 1: they might even be so dumb that if you successfully prank them They'd be like what like you'd open a can of snakes and they they'd be like, huh snakes what what the hell?

544
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,109
Speaker 1: And you'd be like, ah, I just got you with the snakes and it didn't do anything.

545
00:38:38,933 --> 00:38:39,516
Speaker 1: You got to get us.

546
00:38:39,757 --> 00:38:41,204
Speaker 1: only a smart person go.

547
00:38:41,264 --> 00:38:41,686
Speaker 1: Ah snakes.

548
00:38:42,048 --> 00:38:45,519
Speaker 1: Uh-huh Plus the smart person will also gain humor from it.

549
00:38:46,101 --> 00:38:48,590
Speaker 1: Even if they are harmed in the course of the prank.

550
00:38:48,851 --> 00:38:50,176
Speaker 0: Well, it depends on how hard.

551
00:38:50,357 --> 00:38:53,550
Speaker 1: yeah a stupid person might just be all indignant and make it not fun.

552
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,842
Speaker 0: I mean you can't prank someone with a tire iron.

553
00:38:55,963 --> 00:38:57,330
Speaker 0: that moves a little bit beyond Frank.

554
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,002
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh dude, I popped all the tires on your car.

555
00:39:02,263 --> 00:39:03,748
Speaker 0: lol your mom's dead.

556
00:39:03,768 --> 00:39:08,289
Speaker 0: I Killed her for real for real do?

557
00:39:11,671 --> 00:39:16,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but anyway, I'm sorry if that was a kind of rambly show.

558
00:39:16,470 --> 00:39:22,805
Speaker 0: You see since Scott totally copped out on leak nights At least we didn't do something.

559
00:39:22,845 --> 00:39:30,094
Speaker 1: That was unfunny and lame or No one wants to listen to it or Anything dumb.

560
00:39:30,575 --> 00:39:34,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think about how bad this could have been next year.

561
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:38,069
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll do something in the line of what we did at anime club.

562
00:39:39,231 --> 00:39:46,672
Speaker 0: that might be difficult to pull off because we had a captive audience a projector a lot of time to prepare and Absolutely.

563
00:39:46,712 --> 00:39:52,509
Speaker 0: Well, I guess now actually there's far fewer consequences because we were threatened with death a couple times after that April Fool's showing.

564
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:54,521
Speaker 1: Mmm, that's true.

00:39:54,541 --> 00:39:55,429
Speaker 1: That is true.

566
00:39:56,250 --> 00:40:03,978
Speaker 0: But since we had a bunch of people well, we had two people over over the weekend and I got work tomorrow I actually got a lot done this weekend.
