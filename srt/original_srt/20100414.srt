4
00:00:20,803 --> 00:00:23,535
Speaker 2: every time we do a mocha opener you always kind of say it slow like that.

5
00:00:24,197 --> 00:00:24,820
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

6
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:31,364
Speaker 2: Let's do this For the last like week.

7
00:00:31,424 --> 00:00:34,388
Speaker 2: I've been rollerblading home from work in the city.

8
00:00:34,769 --> 00:00:35,850
Speaker 1: It's gonna rain tomorrow though.

9
00:00:36,051 --> 00:00:41,686
Speaker 2: Yeah, so I'm probably not going to do it tomorrow Which is fine because I'm finally going to the DMV to give up the Otari license plate.

10
00:00:41,706 --> 00:00:44,058
Speaker 2: Oh It's the end of an era.

11
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,870
Speaker 1: I always still have to go to the DMV.

12
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:46,633
Speaker 1: Also, I'm gonna.

13
00:00:46,653 --> 00:00:50,286
Speaker 1: I gotta find a way that I need one in Harlem is open until six.

14
00:00:50,547 --> 00:00:51,290
Speaker 1: That's not late enough.

15
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,394
Speaker 1: I got like maybe eight.

16
00:00:52,555 --> 00:00:56,110
Speaker 1: It's I have to go to the doctor the dentist and the DMV and I know the 3ds.

17
00:00:56,672 --> 00:00:57,635
Speaker 2: That's pretty dangerous.

18
00:00:57,776 --> 00:00:58,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I got it.

19
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:01,290
Speaker 1: I got to like schedule it to take the minimum time off work.

20
00:01:01,612 --> 00:01:03,510
Speaker 2: Just take a day off and then use the day to dick around.

21
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:07,893
Speaker 1: That's the four DS Dr.

22
00:01:07,993 --> 00:01:08,355
Speaker 1: Dennis.

23
00:01:08,616 --> 00:01:10,041
Speaker 1: DMV dick around.

24
00:01:10,202 --> 00:01:14,518
Speaker 2: Well, the doctor might also involve some dicking Hopefully not the DMV.

25
00:01:14,538 --> 00:01:15,100
Speaker 2: Definitely.

26
00:01:15,221 --> 00:01:17,169
Speaker 1: I mean I need some doctoring but not in the dick.

27
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:24,466
Speaker 2: But I have some observations about rollerblading in New York City, you know, just almost no one does it.

28
00:01:25,107 --> 00:01:29,980
Speaker 1: actually today I think as long as I've lived here, I've seen three people today.

29
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:42,084
Speaker 2: Today I ran into not literally three Individual rollerbladers other than myself and when I stopped and waited Did you ask them like where they were getting their like rollerblade stuff from now?

30
00:01:42,366 --> 00:01:43,470
Speaker 2: They were just going past me.

31
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:44,396
Speaker 2: I didn't want to stop.

32
00:01:44,437 --> 00:01:46,330
Speaker 2: cuz you know rollerblades it takes a while to get up to speed.

33
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,496
Speaker 2: You did not want to slow down.

34
00:01:47,516 --> 00:01:54,836
Speaker 2: That's the main reason why I'm on the sidewalk anyway, so Observation number one the most important one.

35
00:01:55,538 --> 00:01:58,887
Speaker 2: number of times rim has almost been hit by a car running a red light?

36
00:01:59,348 --> 00:02:05,030
Speaker 2: zero Number of times rim has almost been hit by a jackass bicyclist running a red light.

37
00:02:06,711 --> 00:02:11,845
Speaker 2: You're counting eleven times have I had a green light and I go to rollerblades.

38
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:13,390
Speaker 2: some jackass biker almost hits me.

39
00:02:13,612 --> 00:02:17,557
Speaker 2: Yeah, the cars are fine It's the bikers Even though I noticed biking.

40
00:02:17,577 --> 00:02:22,174
Speaker 1: cuz when you know when your bike like when I got the Mazda 3 suddenly you notice every other Mazda 3 on the road.

41
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:25,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, as soon as I'm biking I notice all the other bikes on the road.

42
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:31,350
Speaker 2: So the thing here's the thing, you know why you're noticing all these assholes on the road anyway.

43
00:02:32,594 --> 00:02:34,671
Speaker 1: now the So.

44
00:02:35,012 --> 00:02:46,299
Speaker 1: so the thing is right, you know, sometimes there are cars that are sort of you know, annoying like I'll be like Hey, dude, give me some room or like they'll double park and it's like great now I can't get around you and this car is going by.

45
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,850
Speaker 1: and if unless I can't go past any further unless I go on the Sidewalk and sometimes that's annoying dude

46
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:53,215
Speaker 2: You haven't driven in the Bronx and

47
00:02:53,296 --> 00:03:06,359
Speaker 1: but you know and sometimes a car will I get behind me and be like beep beep And be like, hey, yeah, you know and it's like, okay, whatever, you know, I can you know sort of understand even it's a little bleh But the bikes are just like whatever.

48
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:06,961
Speaker 1: Whoo.

49
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:08,085
Speaker 1: I see even like old man.

50
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:13,101
Speaker 1: Just run in the red line You know, the bikes are way worse than the cars.

51
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:21,746
Speaker 2: and I'm on the bike saying this, you know, yeah So, I don't know I mean I want a bike but I almost don't want to be associated with all those other bikers.

52
00:03:21,766 --> 00:03:30,255
Speaker 1: then be like me stop with The fucking red lights, you know Don't freakin, you know ring your little horn and everybody We'll see.

53
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:31,849
Speaker 2: the thing is I don't know how much like it.

54
00:03:32,091 --> 00:03:38,657
Speaker 2: I don't know if it'll be that much faster to bike just because it's so short as it is and the primary thing slowing me Down even rollerblading is red lights.

55
00:03:39,381 --> 00:03:41,149
Speaker 1: No, the thing is it's way fast.

56
00:03:42,211 --> 00:03:52,260
Speaker 1: The bike like you go over that bridge and it's just like like I'm like even when I'm pedaling up the hill on the bridge going Yeah, right and I like.

57
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:57,298
Speaker 1: I look at the little fence that prevents you from falling off the bridge and I watch how fast the fence is going by.

58
00:03:57,378 --> 00:04:00,208
Speaker 1: it's like fence post fence post fence post fence post fence.

59
00:04:00,509 --> 00:04:02,566
Speaker 1: and it's like Wow, if I was walking you'd be like fence post.

60
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,808
Speaker 1: Yeah Fence posts, you know.

61
00:04:06,315 --> 00:04:17,904
Speaker 1: So it's like wow even just pedaling really go and struggling in a low gear up a hill on this bridge is Significantly faster than pretty much, you know anything.

62
00:04:17,925 --> 00:04:19,010
Speaker 2: but what amazes me is how many?

63
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,034
Speaker 2: Bikes who end up.

64
00:04:21,075 --> 00:04:22,923
Speaker 2: they walk their bikes up that little tiny hill.

65
00:04:23,024 --> 00:04:32,812
Speaker 1: I see some people walking it up I see some people using the wrong gear, but the thing is it's like it's always like, you know, there is no like stereotype of Bicycling.

66
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:33,053
Speaker 1: like.

67
00:04:33,374 --> 00:04:40,200
Speaker 1: you'll see people who like you like if you saw them just walking around the street normal clothes You might think oh that person, you know, they don't know.

68
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:42,629
Speaker 1: now they're like going way faster than me some old lady.

69
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:52,013
Speaker 2: Well with bicycles in particular I think everyone knows how to ride a bike and New York is just a place where that skill is actually useful Mmm-hmm.

70
00:04:52,274 --> 00:04:57,727
Speaker 2: I think that a lot of people ride bikes just because it's useful and everyone learns not to ride a bike when they're a kid except Greg.

71
00:04:59,272 --> 00:05:07,408
Speaker 2: So on Sunday is the non sequitur And Sunday, you can't make something a sequitur by simply declaring that it was a non sequitur.

72
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:07,929
Speaker 2: Yes, you can.

73
00:05:08,634 --> 00:05:10,990
Speaker 1: So on Sunday, I made some manueva cochina.

74
00:05:12,134 --> 00:05:13,083
Speaker 1: It was so tasty.

75
00:05:13,123 --> 00:05:13,608
Speaker 2: I like it, too.

76
00:05:14,172 --> 00:05:18,449
Speaker 1: So then you know Monday just sat in the fridge and yet last night I ate it again.

77
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,685
Speaker 1: But you didn't want to come and help me eat it even though I had so much like.

78
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,939
Speaker 2: I did want to come and help You eat it, but I had other important things to do.

79
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:25,441
Speaker 2: Uh-huh.

80
00:05:25,722 --> 00:05:27,530
Speaker 2: I was editing YouTube videos.

81
00:05:27,711 --> 00:05:30,945
Speaker 2: You know the geek nights YouTube stream is gonna come online at some point.

82
00:05:30,965 --> 00:05:32,150
Speaker 1: You sure you weren't dicking around.

00:05:32,471 --> 00:05:34,419
Speaker 2: I was also playing DDR.

00:05:40,336 --> 00:05:41,000

Speaker 2: I'm not gonna talk about DDR.

90
00:05:43,634 --> 00:05:46,286
Speaker 2: I'll say one thing I fucking miss playing that shit.

Speaker 2: the memory in Wildwood is so dancing.

94
00:05:52,711 --> 00:05:55,380
Speaker 2: It's so like you can't hear the music and everyone sucks.

95
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,698
Speaker 2: and I kind of forgot how great it is to just have the loud Music using step mania.

00:06:11,391 --> 00:06:12,136
Speaker 0: Where the hell is?

103
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:14,229
Speaker 1: it had a fourth mix folder that was empty, right?

104
00:06:15,113 --> 00:06:18,308
Speaker 2: It actually was full but there were no arrows in there just mp3.

105
00:06:18,891 --> 00:06:21,699
Speaker 1: Oh really the one I got was all arrows and no mp3s.

106
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:25,210
Speaker 1: Ah, but I did get this Konami official folder.

107
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,274
Speaker 2: I downloaded that.

108
00:06:26,294 --> 00:06:26,996
Speaker 2: I didn't look in it.

109
00:06:27,016 --> 00:06:32,317
Speaker 1: yet the Konami official folder that came in the same torrent as the everything else Had a bunch of fourth mix in it.

110
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:34,710
Speaker 1: cuz it was like night in motion and shit weird problem.

111
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:35,472
Speaker 2: Where are you?

112
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:36,314
Speaker 2: so get this.

113
00:06:37,257 --> 00:06:41,208
Speaker 2: I started to play and I was sucking like bad and I'm thinking I'm hurt.

114
00:06:41,428 --> 00:06:42,130
Speaker 2: I'm hurt real bad.

115
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:42,754
Speaker 2: What's going on?

116
00:06:42,774 --> 00:06:43,459
Speaker 2: Do I suck at DDR?

117
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:44,526
Speaker 1: Are you a monkey?

118
00:06:44,687 --> 00:06:48,501
Speaker 2: Is it the Actually downloaded that announcer me too.

119
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:49,305
Speaker 1: I also got that.

120
00:06:49,627 --> 00:06:50,270
Speaker 2: that's the best one.

121
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,770
Speaker 1: But I need to get Alice character pack and also Baldo character pack.

122
00:06:53,910 --> 00:07:11,850
Speaker 2: I was doing so bad and then I thought wait a minute and I turned on the auto sync for one song Which let it little look at how you're dancing and then it'll use the statistical deviation of your steps based on whether like when you hit Close but you're off by a couple milliseconds to figure out how offset the arrows are from the music.

123
00:07:12,271 --> 00:07:14,036
Speaker 2: Mmm, and it offs.

124
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:16,804
Speaker 2: it changed everything by point one one nine seconds.

125
00:07:17,386 --> 00:07:18,689
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm, and then everything was great.

126
00:07:19,452 --> 00:07:20,676
Speaker 2: But then I thought wait a minute.

127
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:24,730
Speaker 2: Maybe I just calibrated this now differently from every DDR machine.

128
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,235
Speaker 2: I'm gonna screw myself in the long run.

129
00:07:26,496 --> 00:07:27,017
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.

130
00:07:27,078 --> 00:07:28,683
Speaker 2: So I started calibrating.

131
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:29,766
Speaker 2: like every song.

132
00:07:29,786 --> 00:07:30,288
Speaker 2: I went through 15 songs.

133
00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:32,459
Speaker 2: I was within point.

134
00:07:32,822 --> 00:07:36,056
Speaker 2: Oh three milliseconds Deviation on all of them.

135
00:07:36,537 --> 00:07:40,048
Speaker 2: So there's a delay in the Mac going to the HDTV.

136
00:07:40,429 --> 00:07:43,147
Speaker 2: Oh Where the delay is.

137
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:53,832
Speaker 2: Okay, I was like what but I felt very precise in my dancing that I was that I am within point zero zero three milliseconds not millisecond seconds of Perfect timing.

138
00:07:54,394 --> 00:07:59,770
Speaker 1: but anyway getting back to my point is I last night I ate some leftover Nuevo cochina and there's even more left over.

139
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:01,516
Speaker 2: Oh my god, you can eat it again tonight.

140
00:08:01,696 --> 00:08:04,686
Speaker 1: No, no, maybe tomorrow, but the like keep that long.

141
00:08:04,987 --> 00:08:05,388
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

142
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:07,033
Speaker 1: No microwaving it.

143
00:08:07,053 --> 00:08:12,534
Speaker 1: So if there's anything nasty thing in there, it's getting hosed unless it already made its poison That's true.

144
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:16,858
Speaker 1: But um, I So I ate two burritos last night.

145
00:08:16,878 --> 00:08:19,406

Speaker 2: it's online.

151
00:08:35,412 --> 00:08:37,842
Speaker 2: All I want to say is we're not talking about anime Boston tonight.

152
00:08:37,863 --> 00:08:39,409
Speaker 2: We're gonna talk about the mocha first.

153
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:41,556
Speaker 2: So, I don't know anime Boston.

154
00:08:41,576 --> 00:08:42,339
Speaker 2: there's not a lot to say.

155
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:44,629
Speaker 2: we recorded a show already, but we're not gonna upload it just yet.

156
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:47,462
Speaker 1: No, it was a convention of anime.

157
00:08:47,482 --> 00:08:50,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did some panels We seem to go over.

158
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,149
Speaker 1: Well, we went to some panels.

159
00:08:52,792 --> 00:08:53,998
Speaker 1: We walked around the dealers room.

160
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:56,730
Speaker 1: once we walked around the artists alley a couple times.

161
00:08:56,730 --> 00:09:09,506
Speaker 2: Darryl Surratt was as always incredibly impressive with his mad array of mad panels And we saw we hung out with people and I'm sorry guys anime Boston was fun and all.

162
00:09:09,546 --> 00:09:11,114
Speaker 2: but The we be.

163
00:09:11,175 --> 00:09:14,570
Speaker 2: it being the weekend after packs just it's really hard.

164
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:20,837
Speaker 2: It's like riding the biggest roller coaster in the world and then riding the kiddie coaster like five times in a row It doesn't matter how many times you ride it.

165
00:09:20,877 --> 00:09:21,720
Speaker 2: It just can't compare.

166
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:27,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like you ride the big roller coaster Whoo, and then you ride the kiddie coaster and you're basically taking a nap on it.

167
00:09:27,190 --> 00:09:30,790
Speaker 2: You know if I'd gone to anime Boston the weekend before packs, it would have been great.

168
00:09:31,011 --> 00:09:32,055
Speaker 1: That's what they should have done.

169
00:09:32,556 --> 00:09:33,359
Speaker 2: Well, they there's.

170
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:36,290
Speaker 2: I don't think there was anyone who had a chance to change that situation.

171
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:40,450
Speaker 1: The anime Boston could have just scheduled two weeks earlier.

172
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,857
Speaker 2: But when did packs actually schedule?

173
00:09:42,897 --> 00:09:45,949
Speaker 2: and when do I remember when they announced where paxies was going to be?

174
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:47,516
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

175
00:09:47,576 --> 00:09:48,810
Speaker 2: It was too late to get the Sheraton.

176
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:53,485
Speaker 1: So hopefully they just there won't be the same weekend cuz that'll be the end of ahead of my boss.

177
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:54,649
Speaker 2: Yeah, at least for us.

178
00:09:54,911 --> 00:10:00,262
Speaker 2: Yeah, oh Well, so I got any anime manga comic media news.

179
00:10:00,663 --> 00:10:07,490
Speaker 1: I do indeed, you know at the mocha I was noticing that you know the you know fan of graphics started doing the oshihiro tatsumi stuff.

180
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:16,022
Speaker 1: But the gecky guy action see, you know in the the you know, the indie underground comics of Japan They're starting to bubble up even more in the indie comics.

181
00:10:16,143 --> 00:10:17,267
Speaker 1: publishers of the u.s.

182
00:10:17,307 --> 00:10:22,570
Speaker 1: Are picking them up You know and it not just fan of graphics brothers like top shelf and such, you know, it's pretty interesting.

183
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:28,329
Speaker 1: It must have been a success for you know fan of graphics if other people are following suit anyway.

184
00:10:29,612 --> 00:10:40,009
Speaker 1: A top shelf is gonna publish a 400 page compilation of stories from a you know underground Anthology of manga from Japan called ax.

185
00:10:40,992 --> 00:10:48,812
Speaker 1: The guy who's in charge of ax named Akino kando is gonna come to New York City on April 21st Next weekend.

186
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:50,217
Speaker 1: Is it really next weekend?

187
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:50,758
Speaker 1: I think so.

188
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:51,741
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

189
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:52,584
Speaker 2: Yeah next week.

190
00:10:52,644 --> 00:10:53,687
Speaker 1: No, it's next Wednesday.

191
00:10:53,707 --> 00:10:54,510
Speaker 1: It's a week from today.

192
00:10:54,812 --> 00:10:55,316
Speaker 1: Oh crap.

193
00:10:55,518 --> 00:10:56,446
Speaker 2: Oh, yeah Wednesday.

194
00:10:56,647 --> 00:11:12,870
Speaker 1: Yeah And the thing is he's doing it at this exhibit that's going on and the exhibit is a showcase of all 120 issues of Garo which is like the original real deal gecky guy magazine that you know tatsumi and others worked on.

195
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:25,374
Speaker 1: So not only do I get to go hear this like, you know modern Underground manga dude talk, but I also get to see every issue of Garo ever in this museum exhibit So it's gonna be totally sweet.

196
00:11:25,394 --> 00:11:26,338
Speaker 2: Well, it's even worse.

197
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:32,477
Speaker 2: There's an opening reception that we could go to but it's Already happened from 6 to 8 p.m.

198
00:11:32,517 --> 00:11:32,859
Speaker 2: Today.

199
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,461
Speaker 2: Yeah.

200
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:34,224
Speaker 1: No, I didn't.

201
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:36,580
Speaker 1: I knew about that a while ago But I didn't want what's.

202
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:37,469
Speaker 1: I didn't want to go to it.

203
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:41,290
Speaker 2: You know, it looks like it's interesting looking at the picture of them.

204
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:41,837
Speaker 2: It's never.

205
00:11:41,918 --> 00:11:45,698
Speaker 1: it's never a good idea Like, you know, I mean people like to go to like openings.

206
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,266
Speaker 1: gallery openings or exhibit openings are great.

207
00:11:48,326 --> 00:11:51,150
Speaker 2: Here's why one free wine Two free cheese and crackers, right?

208
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,179
Speaker 1: The thing is if you act, you know, that's fine.

209
00:11:53,219 --> 00:12:03,355
Speaker 1: if you want wine cheese and crackers, which I do But if you just how I survived our IT if you actually want to see the exhibit going to the opening is actually pretty bad Because that's the time.

210
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,419
Speaker 1: It is the most crowded.

211
00:12:04,459 --> 00:12:05,864
Speaker 1: There's the most people in your way.

212
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,229
Speaker 2: It's tough though, because it's always

213
00:12:07,611 --> 00:12:12,250
Speaker 1: I like to go at a time like when no one else is there so you can just totally take your time

214
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:19,848
Speaker 2: underestimating the factor of the fact that most of the people who go to the openings of these things are going primarily to Hobnob with the other people there.

215
00:12:20,851 --> 00:12:23,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's saying is I'm saying, you know as opposed to look at the art.

216
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,229
Speaker 2: So the few times I've gone to a gallery opening like that was a big deal.

217
00:12:28,192 --> 00:12:38,204
Speaker 2: Most of the people there were kind of standing in the middle talking Drinking the wine eating the cheese and I just went looked at all the art with no one in my way Possible depending on the size and shape of the the gallery.

218
00:12:38,344 --> 00:12:41,183
Speaker 2: But well, yes, I mean if it's shit I don't know what shape would be bad.

219
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:42,049
Speaker 2: Maybe a hexagon.

220
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,652
Speaker 2: So That it.

221
00:12:46,415 --> 00:12:46,836
Speaker 1: yeah, that's it.

222
00:12:46,856 --> 00:12:47,177
Speaker 1: so I got.

223
00:12:47,398 --> 00:12:48,402
Speaker 2: yeah, I don't have too much.

224
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:50,149
Speaker 2: I'm watching a vote Tom.

225
00:12:50,209 --> 00:12:51,961
Speaker 2: slowly I get some DVDs from Scott.

226
00:12:52,263 --> 00:12:56,361
Speaker 2: I started watching Yamato, but I think I'm gonna hold actually watching the.

227
00:12:56,522 --> 00:13:00,539
Speaker 2: I'm gonna hold off on the Yamato because I gotta watch all the vote Toms first so we can actually review it.

228
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,363
Speaker 2: Mm-hmm.

229
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:02,288
Speaker 2: I think it's actually worth.

230
00:13:02,328 --> 00:13:03,595
Speaker 1: Yeah I've watched both.

231
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:06,950
Speaker 1: so you can pick whichever one and we can review how much vote Tom's first.

232
00:13:07,051 --> 00:13:07,393
Speaker 2: I gotta.

233
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:14,190
Speaker 2: it takes a lot longer to watch both times Yeah, but I'll power through it and I'm almost caught up on Dora which is fucking awesome.

234
00:13:14,692 --> 00:13:20,616
Speaker 1: You know the last episode of Dora, I think I don't know if there's a new one on crunchyroll yet But the last one I watched right?

235
00:13:20,656 --> 00:13:23,145
Speaker 1: I think it was episode 12 or 13.

236
00:13:23,145 --> 00:13:24,450
Speaker 1: It seemed like the end of the show.

237
00:13:24,550 --> 00:13:32,926
Speaker 1: It's like oh the show's over and then I went and apparently I talked to you know Some friends of ours who also watched all the episodes that were up there and they're like, no, this is like 24 episodes total.

238
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:35,763
Speaker 1: That's like the halfway climax.

239
00:13:35,784 --> 00:13:41,750
Speaker 1: I was like wow Good, you'll get to an episode and you'd be like, oh, that's the ending right there and it's not the ending.

240
00:13:41,810 --> 00:13:48,090
Speaker 1: It's like oh shit, but my prediction in Dora that I predicted way early was absolutely correct.

241
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:57,267
Speaker 1: So the show is not so good at being like, you know Keeping its mysteries mysterious, but it is still pretty good at being entertaining and awesome.

242
00:13:57,347 --> 00:14:08,765
Speaker 2: So yeah So things of the day.

243
00:14:08,785 --> 00:14:13,417
Speaker 2: I made a critical fatal error recently and now is the time to correct it.

244
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,745
Speaker 2: I Go to College Humor.

245
00:14:15,765 --> 00:14:20,283
Speaker 2: that's where I steal most of my thing of the day videos as many of you smart people may have been Able to figure out.

246
00:14:20,665 --> 00:14:23,580
Speaker 1: let's not let's link to like the YouTube version of this video.

247
00:14:27,641 --> 00:14:29,347
Speaker 1: Well, I'd make the pose so guess what.

248
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:33,020
Speaker 2: but regardless now normally I pride myself in my internet filter.

249
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:34,874
Speaker 2: I mean, you know, well Scott now will be sitting there.

250
00:14:34,894 --> 00:14:45,469
Speaker 2: We'll have friends over we'll be going through the College Humor or some other site looking at funny videos and Scott my usually we look through and we pinpoint like that one will be funny That one's not worth watching.

251
00:14:45,509 --> 00:14:46,114
Speaker 2: that will be funny.

252
00:14:46,134 --> 00:14:47,060
Speaker 2: That was not worth watching.

253
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,723
Speaker 2: We got a filter.

254
00:14:48,084 --> 00:14:54,711
Speaker 2: we're always on the same page and all the kind of inexperienced people will sit there and be like, ah What about that one cute dog blah blah?

255
00:14:54,731 --> 00:14:56,158
Speaker 2: that looks good, but they're never good.

256
00:14:56,479 --> 00:15:00,980
Speaker 2: Yep Well, uh my filter for the first time in my life has failed me.

257
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:05,120
Speaker 1: Well, I to your credit right and you know to the credit of our filters, right?

258
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,513
Speaker 1: It wasn't a situation of a false positive reset.

259
00:15:07,574 --> 00:15:08,660
Speaker 1: Oh, this will be good and it sucked.

260
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:12,311
Speaker 1: It's a situation of you said, oh that sucked and it was good.

261
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:15,180
Speaker 2: So I filter filters out pretty much all the plankton.

262
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:23,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, as long as you get as long as you don't watch any bad things if you miss some good things It's okay cuz good things come around again, especially from the vault or whatever.

263
00:15:24,321 --> 00:15:28,057
Speaker 1: Whereas if you you know, you just want to avoid wasting time on bad things and you're all set.

264
00:15:28,459 --> 00:15:38,422
Speaker 2: So Gary oak, I'm Gary oak with my cribby crab is this is just fucking hilarious Miss tea, there's nothing else to say about it.

265
00:15:38,763 --> 00:15:39,306
Speaker 2: pedophile.

266
00:15:39,547 --> 00:15:47,061
Speaker 1: That's right Let's see, okay, so my thing of the day here is totally awesome.

267
00:15:47,081 --> 00:15:55,890
Speaker 1: it is a is for As a four as takes in atomic armor attacking anomalous amphibians.

268
00:15:56,892 --> 00:16:01,056
Speaker 1: So what this is here, it's I guess unreality magazine Which I've never heard of before.

269
00:16:01,116 --> 00:16:05,132
Speaker 1: but they've got a post here and the post is the most badass Alphabet ever.

270
00:16:05,193 --> 00:16:14,611
Speaker 1: and it looks like they got a different artist to do each letter of the alphabet in some nerdy fashion with alliteration and You know.

271
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:20,350
Speaker 1: and so there's an illustration and an alliteration in nerd fashion for every single letter of the alphabet by a different artist.

272
00:16:20,450 --> 00:16:21,836
Speaker 2: So I saw one of these before.

273
00:16:21,857 --> 00:16:22,821
Speaker 2: I didn't realize it was the thing.

274
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:24,910
Speaker 2: I just saw W like links over.

275
00:16:25,111 --> 00:16:30,269
Speaker 1: so for P it's like Peter Parker playing ping-pong with Pikachu and there's a hilarious picture.

276
00:16:30,289 --> 00:16:38,210
Speaker 1: and For K there K is for kiss King Kong and it's King Kong throwing up the horns with some kiss makeup.

277
00:16:38,314 --> 00:16:38,730
Speaker 2: I don't know.

278
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:43,532
Speaker 2: I think my personal favorite is still Q is for Q and Q reading Q just because it has a Recursion.

279
00:16:43,773 --> 00:16:48,130
Speaker 2: recursion does add a lot to that one, you know, it's the classic picture of your cubicle.

280
00:16:48,231 --> 00:16:50,430
Speaker 2: But in the picture is the picture of the cubicle.

281
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:55,190
Speaker 1: I like the art the best on the Tintin one because it actually looks like Tintin art.

282
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:57,750
Speaker 1: It's Tintin and a Time Lord taking tea in Tibet.

283
00:16:58,631 --> 00:17:04,954
Speaker 2: But if I had to pick a favorite one, I don't know that evolving emu is pretty funny just for the way It's kind of laughing.

284
00:17:05,255 --> 00:17:06,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's pretty good.

285
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:09,210
Speaker 2: a little bit of Psyduck with a little bit of Howard the Duck.

286
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:14,130
Speaker 1: Yeah Picking a favorite like none of them like they're all pretty awesome.

287
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,950
Speaker 1: But I don't I can't find one that's like the awesomest like way up above the other ones.

288
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:21,969
Speaker 1: I guess this Optimus Prime obliterating Oompa Loompas is pretty good.

289
00:17:23,571 --> 00:17:24,377
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

290
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:26,329
Speaker 1: This is a totally awesome nerdy alphabet.

291
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:31,750
Speaker 1: And if you want to see Galactus geeking out with his glove puppets of Gundam and Godzilla, you should go to this website.

292
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:35,710
Speaker 2: But all that aside we kind of talked about a lot of non mocha.

293
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:45,490
Speaker 2: So I suppose we should just talk about the mocha or at least the art festival Not the museum that we've never really talked about saying art festivals redundant because the last a and mocha is art.

294
00:17:45,611 --> 00:17:51,109
Speaker 1: so it's like if you say mocha art festival, you're actually saying Museum of comic and cartoon art.

295
00:17:52,678 --> 00:17:54,690
Speaker 2: If I say just mocha festival it might be about coffee.

296
00:17:54,991 --> 00:18:00,347
Speaker 1: No, the mocha festival is definitely the correct way to say it, but doesn't that not also refer to coffee?

297
00:18:00,408 --> 00:18:00,648
Speaker 2: or perhaps?

298
00:18:00,688 --> 00:18:06,281
Speaker 1: no There isn't a mocha festival with an H in it, it doesn't exist.

299
00:18:06,662 --> 00:18:18,100
Speaker 2: maybe we should pronounce one of the C's different like No or draw anyway, ha ha so you might have noticed much like before when we had guest host Conrad Crayley Why do you keep insisting on this guest host business?

300
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,045
Speaker 2: talk about cell phones?

301
00:18:19,145 --> 00:18:20,170
Speaker 2: We have it yet again.

302
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,030
Speaker 2: We're gonna try to make this a trend at least for a while.

303
00:18:22,371 --> 00:18:27,489
Speaker 0: We have the right honorable Emily Compton because it's so rare that I'm in this room with you guys.

304
00:18:27,851 --> 00:18:29,378
Speaker 2: She's usually the studio audience.

305
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:31,969
Speaker 2: She's been a guest in the past a guest host in the past.

306
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:34,550
Speaker 1: Well, see, uh, let's see even you your fail.

307
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:37,224
Speaker 1: It's not a guest host unless they are hosting.

308
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:40,037
Speaker 1: just give up on it Just like you give up on your stupid guess.

309
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,526
Speaker 1: that's pride and all that other stupid shit you keep doing.

310
00:18:42,707 --> 00:18:43,570
Speaker 2: my hilarious sticks.

311
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're non hilarious repetitive annoying sticks.

312
00:18:51,391 --> 00:18:52,113
Speaker 1: It's not me it's.

313
00:18:52,334 --> 00:18:53,798
Speaker 1: nobody likes these takes.

314
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:57,330
Speaker 2: I will point out that for everyone other than you that's pride.

315
00:18:57,792 --> 00:18:58,474
Speaker 2: It's not a stick.

316
00:18:58,514 --> 00:18:59,417
Speaker 2: That's a one-off joke.

317
00:18:59,437 --> 00:18:59,899
Speaker 2: That's hilarious.

318
00:18:59,959 --> 00:19:03,070
Speaker 0: No, I see it every time and I'm like, it's coming.

319
00:19:03,293 --> 00:19:04,450
Speaker 0: You guys know it's coming.

320
00:19:05,431 --> 00:19:09,217
Speaker 2: When I was anime Boston guys sitting to my left He did not see it coming.

321
00:19:09,237 --> 00:19:12,254
Speaker 2: when I said, I guess that's pride you left You know what.

322
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:13,540
Speaker 1: for now on every time we do that.

323
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:16,454
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be like, oh, I guess you're Greg Hartman And you know what?

324
00:19:16,574 --> 00:19:18,001
Speaker 2: No one else is gonna know what that means.

325
00:19:18,121 --> 00:19:18,925
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

326
00:19:18,965 --> 00:19:19,930
Speaker 1: You'll know what it means.

327
00:19:20,794 --> 00:19:23,310
Speaker 1: It should make you you'll feel bad and you should feel bad.

328
00:19:23,390 --> 00:19:34,930
Speaker 0: There was this chart about dweebs and geeks and nerds and stuff like that And one of the things for being a dweeb was that you go around repeating the same joke over and over to different people.

329
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:39,407
Speaker 2: So you are point out is that not also what someone like George Carlin does?

330
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:40,130
Speaker 2: he tells the same?

331
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:44,279
Speaker 0: About it and you can see it and it's like record.

332
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,603
Speaker 1: He wrote the joke.

333
00:19:45,683 --> 00:19:50,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's not pretending he's being like Original every time.

334
00:19:50,598 --> 00:19:50,719
Speaker 0: it's.

335
00:19:50,859 --> 00:19:58,410
Speaker 2: it's like yeah, this is like it's a performance Like old Jews telling jokes, it's not any telling of a joke or performance.

336
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:01,610
Speaker 2: So what if you happen to tell the same joke multiple times in the course of your life?

337
00:20:02,370 --> 00:20:05,606
Speaker 0: Well, I guess you're part of it is you're pretending.

338
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:08,156
Speaker 0: when you tell the joke It's like a one-off performance.

339
00:20:08,217 --> 00:20:10,285
Speaker 0: Like I am performing just for you.

340
00:20:10,345 --> 00:20:15,816
Speaker 0: And this is an original joke I thought up because I am so witty but It's just.

341
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,403
Speaker 1: I think it's simpler than that.

342
00:20:17,624 --> 00:20:18,830
Speaker 1: your joke isn't funny.

343
00:20:19,971 --> 00:20:21,999
Speaker 1: George Carlin is funny every time.

344
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:22,823
Speaker 1: I think the pride.

345
00:20:22,863 --> 00:20:24,730
Speaker 1: you are funny zero times.

346
00:20:24,811 --> 00:20:27,150
Speaker 1: It wasn't funny the first time or any time thereafter.

347
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:40,441
Speaker 1: The point is is that we are not Guest hosts unless we are not here is just guest.

348
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:43,690
Speaker 2: All right, I might get some backup arguments later.

349
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:50,243
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone will agree with you that someone is a guest host unless We are not here and they are taking up the duties of hosting.

350
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:53,908
Speaker 1: if they're just on the show with us They're only a guest and not a guest host.

351
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:54,412
Speaker 2: But if what?

352
00:20:54,432 --> 00:20:55,255
Speaker 2: if they're hosting with us?

353
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:59,055
Speaker 1: if someone sits next to Letterman those that's not a guest host as a guest We'll see.

354
00:20:59,075 --> 00:21:00,950
Speaker 1: if Letterman is letterman is sick at home.

355
00:21:03,055 --> 00:21:07,750
Speaker 0: Okay, so geek nights is like an apartment that you guys share.

356
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:13,809
Speaker 0: It's like having a guest host would be like putting somebody's name on the lease or having them sublet.

357
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:27,170
Speaker 0: So anyway the mocha the mocha art festival it was Festival and not boiling hot like it was last year, which was very very nice.

358
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have to give credit to the to the people running it right?

359
00:21:29,906 --> 00:21:30,530
Speaker 1: It's like okay.

360
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:34,250
Speaker 1: They were in the puck building not so good because it's cramped with the multiple rooms.

361
00:21:34,792 --> 00:21:36,098
Speaker 0: Crazy old elevator.

362
00:21:36,118 --> 00:21:37,262
Speaker 0: you go up in the creaky.

363
00:21:37,303 --> 00:21:43,444
Speaker 1: I mean, it really wasn't it wasn't ideal Yeah, so they moved to the armory which was you know cheap.

364
00:21:43,925 --> 00:21:45,350
Speaker 1: right because they don't have a lot of monies.

365
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:46,232
Speaker 1: You know, it's mostly.

366
00:21:46,293 --> 00:21:49,582
Speaker 1: this is where the mocha museum gets all its fundraising from.

367
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:53,174
Speaker 1: is, you know, the armory selling ammo Right.

368
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:59,570
Speaker 1: So, you know they had it in the armory Which is this big empty room that they do like drills and usually when it's not being used for festivals.

369
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,661
Speaker 0: There were actually some On-duty soldiers walking around on the second floor.

370
00:22:04,681 --> 00:22:05,303
Speaker 1: It's an armory.

371
00:22:05,344 --> 00:22:05,785
Speaker 1: It's real.

372
00:22:05,825 --> 00:22:06,347
Speaker 1: It's in use.

373
00:22:06,367 --> 00:22:07,070
Speaker 1: There's arms there.

374
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:10,790
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's the real deal, but it was funny how many people at the mocha just had no idea.

375
00:22:10,891 --> 00:22:11,598
Speaker 2: That's what was going on.

376
00:22:11,638 --> 00:22:28,550
Speaker 0: Like that's what the building was Because it's got all these signs and it's like US Army and they've got a list of people who passed away in wars Says like operation, you know Iraqi freedom and stuff on some of this it is really old.

377
00:22:29,714 --> 00:22:34,130
Speaker 2: That sort of thing they don't look at like a building like that and just think about modern military.

378
00:22:34,251 --> 00:22:36,170
Speaker 2: They think of it as like a relic something old.

379
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:36,431
Speaker 2: They don't.

380
00:22:36,732 --> 00:22:42,650
Speaker 2: no one really considers their daily life that all those things are kind of real and that we do saw that stuff Just kind of next door in the building.

381
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:48,406
Speaker 0: But the thing is I mean the Chrysler buildings damn old but like modern day businesses are still in that.

382
00:22:48,566 --> 00:22:51,094
Speaker 0: how is a military Building any different?

383
00:22:51,697 --> 00:22:55,010
Speaker 2: Well, just because people don't think about military stuff like that in their daily lives.

384
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:56,840
Speaker 2: Anyway, this is this is completely tangential.

385
00:22:59,792 --> 00:23:01,802
Speaker 1: The point is is that you know, they had it.

386
00:23:02,003 --> 00:23:08,650
Speaker 1: they moved it to this armory But they didn't change the time of year and the result was that the armory had really no air conditioning.

387
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:11,063
Speaker 1: It was like an a zillion degrees last year.

388
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:12,209
Speaker 0: Is this big?

389
00:23:13,190 --> 00:23:20,310
Speaker 0: You know metal dome and it had the worst fanboy funk, but the thing is there were no fanboys there.

390
00:23:20,451 --> 00:23:21,705
Speaker 0: It was just that hot.

391
00:23:21,907 --> 00:23:36,990
Speaker 1: Yep So all credit to them because I would have tried to find another place, you know And I wouldn't have found one because there aren't any and all credit to the people at the the mocha for coming up with the idea Of hey Let's just move it to a different time of year in the same building when it's not a million.

392
00:23:37,190 --> 00:23:40,965
Speaker 2: They got really lucky because I note that the entire week up until the mocha.

393
00:23:41,306 --> 00:23:44,767
Speaker 2: It was like 80 degrees Couple days.

394
00:23:47,495 --> 00:23:48,201
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty.

395
00:23:48,222 --> 00:23:56,052
Speaker 1: it was a pretty safe Safe-go plus it, you know, it wasn't as warm as it was for the last year not even close It was.

396
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,723
Speaker 0: it was like incredibly pleasant weather that day.

397
00:23:58,744 --> 00:24:00,210
Speaker 0: It was nice and brisk.

398
00:24:01,332 --> 00:24:01,813
Speaker 1: It's very good.

399
00:24:02,395 --> 00:24:12,750
Speaker 0: Anyway, so in terms of my policy like every time I go to mocha It's kind of like I'm overwhelmed by the amount of things that I want to buy.

400
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:16,150
Speaker 0: So I figured I'm gonna take out a certain amount of money.

401
00:24:16,210 --> 00:24:25,590
Speaker 0: It took out $100 and I wasn't gonna spend more than that which is a sizable sum, but I also figured you know They have a lot of publishers there.

402
00:24:25,630 --> 00:24:31,049
Speaker 0: They're indie publishers, but they're pretty big like like top shelf or vertical and stuff like that.

403
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:35,624
Speaker 0: And so I said to myself if there's something I can get online.

404
00:24:36,046 --> 00:24:39,090
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna buy it at the festival I might buy it later online.

405
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:43,686
Speaker 0: But it's like this this money is just set aside for any comics and special things.

406
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:44,589
Speaker 0: I can only get here.

407
00:24:45,091 --> 00:24:50,070
Speaker 1: Well, the you know, I totally agree with that like, you know, it's obvious sort of logic that I would normally follow.

408
00:24:50,171 --> 00:24:50,633
Speaker 1: You know, it's like.

409
00:24:50,955 --> 00:24:52,766
Speaker 1: why should I buy this book from top shelf?

410
00:24:52,826 --> 00:24:57,810
Speaker 1: It's on Amazon You know like buying a funny mini comic about lumberjacks, you ain't getting that anywhere else, right?

411
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,243
Speaker 1: But you know a book from a real publisher.

412
00:25:00,304 --> 00:25:01,230
Speaker 1: you can get that anytime.

413
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:06,850
Speaker 1: The thing is the people are there if the person's there right and it's not like, you know autographs.

414
00:25:06,991 --> 00:25:09,229
Speaker 1: I don't really care so much about autographs, you know.

415
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:10,595
Speaker 1: But it's like need to talk to.

416
00:25:10,656 --> 00:25:13,969
Speaker 1: it's like the person's there and it's like what I'm gonna go up and talk to the person.

417
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:15,213
Speaker 1: Wrote the.

418
00:25:15,273 --> 00:25:18,350
Speaker 1: we made the book that I like and then I'm not gonna buy it, you know.

419
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:18,892
Speaker 1: So it's like.

420
00:25:18,932 --> 00:25:21,541
Speaker 1: well, you know I can go do it's like.

421
00:25:21,561 --> 00:25:22,545
Speaker 1: I could go and buy.

422
00:25:22,625 --> 00:25:24,772
Speaker 1: I had if I could go and buy The newest dr.

423
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:34,226
Speaker 1: McNinja volume, you know from you know, the Internet's or I could go buy it from the dr McNinja guy who's there right now and it's you know, it's to pay to co either way.

424
00:25:34,286 --> 00:25:35,110
Speaker 1: So what's the difference?

425
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:36,020
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy.

426
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:43,045
Speaker 2: definitely All you have to do is you know, you talk to him and be like hey So, you know I already bought your book on to pay to go.

427
00:25:43,205 --> 00:25:48,225
Speaker 0: but that's a lie Rim, if we hadn't already bought the book, it would be terrible.

428
00:25:48,245 --> 00:25:49,430
Speaker 2: You haven't already bought it.

429
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:53,817
Speaker 2: But if you pre-order everything or you get it on to pay to co that's true Like if you got a pre-order in.

430
00:25:53,857 --> 00:25:56,710
Speaker 1: but the point if it's like the same price, it's like what you know, who cares?

431
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:58,189
Speaker 0: Well, it's like Hope Larson's book.

432
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:01,210
Speaker 0: She it's sold on Amazon and everything.

433
00:26:01,371 --> 00:26:06,432
Speaker 0: But it was cool to buy it directly from her and talk to her Briefly.

434
00:26:06,513 --> 00:26:10,970
Speaker 2: the person reason I bought it from her in person was that a lot of people were saying that it's gonna sell out.

435
00:26:10,990 --> 00:26:12,076
Speaker 2: There's gonna be another print run.

436
00:26:12,256 --> 00:26:14,890
Speaker 1: That's that's also a quite frequent possibility.

437
00:26:15,011 --> 00:26:16,538
Speaker 1: Another thing is that the person who makes it.

438
00:26:16,638 --> 00:26:19,089
Speaker 1: usually when you buy it from them at the they get a lot more monies.

439
00:26:19,713 --> 00:26:23,053
Speaker 1: Then you know if you buy it on Amazon, it's like oh, yeah Amazon takes a cut

440
00:26:23,334 --> 00:26:24,297
Speaker 0: the publisher

441
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:32,365
Speaker 1: takes a cut and the person who wrote made it got a royalty if you buy it from them At the convention, it's like they get a lot greater percentage of money.

442
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:39,585
Speaker 2: I didn't realize that This funny feeling that several of them do not in fact pay the duly owed sales taxes.

443
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:40,247
Speaker 1: Yep.

444
00:26:40,347 --> 00:26:40,989
Speaker 1: Most likely.

445
00:26:41,029 --> 00:26:43,138
Speaker 2: Yes I have that impression.

446
00:26:43,359 --> 00:26:45,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably some of the mini comics.

447
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:51,850
Speaker 0: But actually I was happy to see that the Scandinavian comics had actually expanded this year.

448
00:26:52,050 --> 00:26:54,344
Speaker 1: I think they were more like three or four years in a row.

449
00:26:54,405 --> 00:26:58,288
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I Know they had more than one table.

450
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:05,687
Speaker 0: It started with two it started with two like two years ago and then it's gradually expanded.

451
00:27:05,807 --> 00:27:10,198
Speaker 0: and I think this year there were More comics than ever before.

452
00:27:10,238 --> 00:27:21,580
Speaker 0: and I actually a shout out to our friend Timo Because he sent us a box of comics which I've read most of them and you guys haven't so nag nag, but He sent this one.

453
00:27:21,661 --> 00:27:26,350
Speaker 0: I don't even remember the name of it But it's about these two girls who live in a cabin and it's kind of funny.

454
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:27,518
Speaker 2: I had no idea either.

455
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:36,529
Speaker 0: I still thought it was it was cute and there was like goofy stuff going on like somebody fart in a bottle.

456
00:27:38,591 --> 00:27:41,764
Speaker 0: But I was like, you know, I saw this is it?

457
00:27:41,804 --> 00:27:46,766
Speaker 1: well, I guess they call it a Dutch oven Right when you fart under the blanket, so is that like a Dutch bottle?

458
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:47,530
Speaker 0: I guess so.

459
00:27:49,773 --> 00:27:58,506
Speaker 0: The point being I recognize this comic book character on one of the The Finnish comics tables postcards and I was like, oh I know this comic.

460
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:04,094
Speaker 0: my friend sent it to me And it's really cool and I was talking to the lady and they were like really really surprised I knew it.

461
00:28:04,195 --> 00:28:04,678
Speaker 0: So I was.

462
00:28:04,778 --> 00:28:06,046
Speaker 0: I was very proud of myself.

463
00:28:06,187 --> 00:28:11,068
Speaker 1: Yay but That you coincidentally saw something.

464
00:28:11,088 --> 00:28:17,650
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, you know that I that I actually had something to talk about common knowledge with Finnish comics.

465
00:28:17,791 --> 00:28:18,856
Speaker 0: That was that was part of it.

466
00:28:18,896 --> 00:28:19,600
Speaker 0: I was like, yay.

467
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,369
Speaker 0: I knew something about Finnish comics.

468
00:28:22,911 --> 00:28:26,243
Speaker 1: It's like if you're a comics person any random person who's walking around.

469
00:28:26,283 --> 00:28:28,210
Speaker 1: it's like, oh, yeah, we all know these same things.

470
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:29,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

471
00:28:29,554 --> 00:28:35,010
Speaker 0: it was cool and I talked to like one of the guys from Sweden for a really long time.

472
00:28:35,070 --> 00:28:40,730
Speaker 0: But I felt really bad for him because most of his books got lost by UPS in international shipping.

473
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:47,250
Speaker 0: So he he drew like this picture of him and his friend and they were all sad because we have no books.

474
00:28:47,531 --> 00:28:59,449
Speaker 0: and but he was also showing me this Quarterly publication that has all sorts of international comics in it that that the Scandinavian consulates seem to be involved in.

475
00:29:00,213 --> 00:29:01,579
Speaker 2: Because there was another situation.

476
00:29:01,619 --> 00:29:11,868
Speaker 2: apparently some of the people coming from Canada they were on a bus and the bus got stopped for customs and customs almost took all their books because they wanted to get him on some import tax that they didn't know.

477
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:12,069
Speaker 1: shit.

478
00:29:12,089 --> 00:29:18,932
Speaker 2: and the sad story I was told was that apparently customs like made a big deal about it and delayed the bus for like an hour and Was mad.

479
00:29:18,952 --> 00:29:19,835
Speaker 2: and this huge problem.

480
00:29:20,477 --> 00:29:25,502
Speaker 2: and then they finally like they flipped through one of the books and they look disappointed like oh these Aren't professional.

481
00:29:25,543 --> 00:29:29,936
Speaker 2: and then they gave him back Sad story I'd ever heard.

482
00:29:29,956 --> 00:29:32,986
Speaker 0: that is not the ending I was expecting for that.

483
00:29:33,266 --> 00:29:34,129
Speaker 0: Oh, that's so sad.

484
00:29:34,935 --> 00:29:36,690
Speaker 2: That was incredibly heartbreaking.

485
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,533
Speaker 0: I thought it was gonna end with.

486
00:29:38,713 --> 00:29:40,496
Speaker 0: oh it had porn in it or something.

487
00:29:40,536 --> 00:29:46,105
Speaker 0: because actually there's a surprising amount of like Strangely erotic comics.

488
00:29:46,205 --> 00:29:46,666
Speaker 0: not like.

489
00:29:46,967 --> 00:29:48,271
Speaker 0: they're not sexy sexy.

490
00:29:48,311 --> 00:29:55,431
Speaker 2: They're just like penis head guy In an r-crumb kind of exactly.

491
00:29:55,451 --> 00:29:56,154
Speaker 0: that's a.

492
00:29:56,174 --> 00:29:57,620
Speaker 2: that's a wonderful way to put it.

493
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:58,305
Speaker 2: It's very like.

494
00:29:58,406 --> 00:29:59,939
Speaker 1: I don't even know if a lot of them are erotic.

495
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:11,079
Speaker 1: They just happen that they have nakedness the way like, you know old art has no Very very weird like there's a palace coming out of this.

496
00:30:11,605 --> 00:30:12,640
Speaker 1: Is that erotic for you?

497
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,041
Speaker 0: But it's it's like.

498
00:30:14,081 --> 00:30:17,024
Speaker 0: I suppose it sends it like draws a lot of depictions of genitalia.

499
00:30:17,064 --> 00:30:27,947
Speaker 0: it's it's Erotic art in the very least.

500
00:30:27,987 --> 00:30:31,279
Speaker 2: there are many many more penis related items than there were.

501
00:30:31,319 --> 00:30:32,663
Speaker 1: vagina I don't know personally.

502
00:30:32,704 --> 00:30:39,860
Speaker 1: I don't count, you know, just because something has a depiction of a of a phallus or something else You know in my book that doesn't make it erotic.

503
00:30:40,101 --> 00:30:43,153
Speaker 1: I mean is my is this day, you know, is the statue of David?

504
00:30:43,214 --> 00:30:43,917
Speaker 1: is that erotic?

505
00:30:43,957 --> 00:30:44,720
Speaker 1: It's got a penis.

506
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:48,073
Speaker 2: So what if the David was using his penis to bop people over the head?

507
00:30:48,756 --> 00:30:49,760
Speaker 1: That would just be funny.

508
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,211
Speaker 2: My mission to anyone out there is to have that.

509
00:30:55,351 --> 00:30:57,398
Speaker 1: at the mocha someone someone draw a picture of.

510
00:30:57,458 --> 00:31:00,263
Speaker 1: you know 24 hour come.

511
00:31:00,303 --> 00:31:09,307
Speaker 1: okay 24 hour comics at the mocha Like a new hot thing to do.

512
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:13,442
Speaker 1: it's like people go to like comic stores when they're having big sales or what, you know Whatever.

513
00:31:13,462 --> 00:31:15,260
Speaker 1: There's a like a local comic event.

514
00:31:15,481 --> 00:31:21,888
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll get some artists to show up and do a 24-hour comic at the event and then you know That's like the stick lately, but it's like I.

515
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,939
Speaker 0: I picked up a handful and a lot of them were written on it.

516
00:31:25,201 --> 00:31:34,919
Speaker 1: It said, you know, this was done as a 24-hour And I think the 24-hour comic day also like the day you're supposed to do it And then all the artists who do it they keep the 24-hour comic and then they sell it.

517
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:39,960
Speaker 0: You know over and over again like yuko does it and a handful of my art friends do it.

518
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:43,493
Speaker 0: So yeah, it's it's like a yearly thing, but it it also.

519
00:31:43,593 --> 00:31:44,978
Speaker 0: you can do it whenever it's like the.

520
00:31:45,139 --> 00:31:52,317
Speaker 1: you know The the NaNoWriMo, it's like it's the same kind of stick but less Intensive than the NaNoWriMo.

521
00:31:52,498 --> 00:32:02,740
Speaker 1: Yeah So so the mocha I guess this year compared to last year, you know two years previous It was I think they were actually it was smaller in terms of number of tables.

522
00:32:03,202 --> 00:32:07,180
Speaker 1: The turnout in terms of you know, visitors seemed to be about the same, you know.

523
00:32:07,281 --> 00:32:09,552
Speaker 1: But the you know The number of tables was less.

524
00:32:09,592 --> 00:32:14,558
Speaker 1: in the back right corner There was actually an area with all these like tall circular tables kind of a hangout zone.

525
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:17,006
Speaker 2: Yeah Various business cards like that.

526
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:22,000
Speaker 0: It's like then somebody who couldn't afford a table would just put their put their business card.

527
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:26,474
Speaker 1: I think people who had tables also put their business cards on there, you know, yeah But you know, it was just.

528
00:32:26,657 --> 00:32:30,320
Speaker 1: you know They had as they always have an area where you can put flyers at the mocha.

529
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:36,635
Speaker 1: But you know having it back there it's like well we didn't sell enough tables to fill this space So let's fill it with this instead.

530
00:32:36,675 --> 00:32:38,228
Speaker 1: and that was you know It made a nice area.

531
00:32:38,268 --> 00:32:39,316
Speaker 1: you could just stand in and go.

532
00:32:39,538 --> 00:32:49,182
Speaker 2: ah But while the side like there were definitely I think fewer tables and everything The density of awesome was such that usually I budget like a few hours and I can walk through the whole thing see everything be Good to go.

533
00:32:49,202 --> 00:32:50,591
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was weird ever man.

534
00:32:50,731 --> 00:32:52,200
Speaker 1: I didn't like I didn't eat breakfast.

535
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:53,717
Speaker 1: Well, I ate a little bit of breakfast.

536
00:32:53,737 --> 00:32:57,292
Speaker 0: barely I had a chunk of rims corn muffin and that's all I ate.

537
00:32:57,352 --> 00:33:06,700
Speaker 1: right because I was expecting to like go to the mocha See a whole bunch of stuff eat lunch Maybe go back for an hour and then be like, all right, whatever and be out of there like, you know mid-afternoon.

538
00:33:06,961 --> 00:33:10,340
Speaker 2: So usually usually through barely an aisle and a half

539
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:19,865
Speaker 1: Yeah Usually you go to the mocha you see everything and then you've seen it all and then you walk around again like sort of cursor Lee and You know, it's like okay

540
00:33:19,905 --> 00:33:27,157
Speaker 2: my two hours of walking and I know I was not even halfway through like all the like all the I also wanted to see a bump through enough and I'm like, hey, how does it go?

541
00:33:27,177 --> 00:33:28,659
Speaker 2: And he's like man It's like molasses.

542
00:33:30,020 --> 00:33:36,156
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this year the quality was definitely way way way up.

543
00:33:36,496 --> 00:33:37,940
Speaker 0: yeah, actually it was funny.

544
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:43,187
Speaker 0: I convinced one of my co-workers to go and He he was.

545
00:33:43,489 --> 00:33:51,780
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if he's so much an indie comic person He doesn't know much about comic books But he went to check it out and he was like there are a lot of illustrators there that were kind of cool and everything.

546
00:33:51,941 --> 00:33:52,927
Speaker 0: So I was happy.

547
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:56,404
Speaker 0: I was like, maybe he'll get into it But I don't see.

548
00:33:56,444 --> 00:34:01,620
Speaker 1: you know, if you're a human being who enjoys any amount of arts there is something for you.

549
00:34:01,861 --> 00:34:03,026
Speaker 1: You know, there's no reason not to go.

550
00:34:03,086 --> 00:34:03,689
Speaker 1: It's so cheap.

551
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:06,100
Speaker 1: It's like what 10 bucks to get in 14 bucks?

552
00:34:06,281 --> 00:34:09,739
Speaker 2: Well, no, no, it's about $400 to get in because you're gonna have to buy all that stuff.

553
00:34:10,342 --> 00:34:12,110
Speaker 1: No, but you know the point way to avoid that.

554
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:14,520
Speaker 1: the point is is it just it's cheap to get a badge?

555
00:34:14,681 --> 00:34:16,317
Speaker 1: You know you just go in it's.

556
00:34:16,458 --> 00:34:24,040
Speaker 1: you know It takes only a few hours and it's just like it's such a good time if you're anywhere within distance There's no reason not to go unless you got something better going on.

557
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:38,820
Speaker 0: There's just a really really wide range of both the skill levels like everything from the guy who just photocopies his own stuff all the way up to like the glossy bound Hardcover books from the big publishers, but it's like what did we see we saw?

558
00:34:38,820 --> 00:34:49,226
Speaker 0: $125 enormous full-color book And stuff like that.

559
00:34:49,266 --> 00:34:50,971
Speaker 0: a bunch a bunch of artists.

560
00:34:50,991 --> 00:34:53,540
Speaker 2: there were a lot of hardcover books from very small press.

561
00:34:53,620 --> 00:34:55,750
Speaker 2: I think there's suddenly a cheap way to make hardcover.

562
00:34:55,770 --> 00:34:57,077
Speaker 0: Well must be cuz.

563
00:34:57,318 --> 00:35:01,253
Speaker 0: uh Kalman I ran into the guy who used to run.

564
00:35:01,273 --> 00:35:09,220
Speaker 0: He's like a nerdy guy who ran D&D for us freshman year of college and he's he's very loud and kind of bossy.

565
00:35:09,681 --> 00:35:15,880
Speaker 0: but he's been doing a comic with this artist from Argentina or something like that and he had a bunch of hardcover books for sale.

566
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:19,846
Speaker 0: and I know if Kalman's still pretty indie.

567
00:35:20,007 --> 00:35:24,500
Speaker 0: So if he could afford hardcover books, I guess it's not so much of a money drain.

568
00:35:24,961 --> 00:35:29,917
Speaker 2: So things that really stood out to me in no particular at all one diary of Diaries.

569
00:35:29,957 --> 00:35:36,178
Speaker 2: the trilogy has ended three years and I'm sad to say it has come to an end.

570
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,843
Speaker 2: But the quote from the.

571
00:35:37,863 --> 00:35:42,837
Speaker 2: I'm gonna read the quote from the last page because it sums up the whole epic story arc.

572
00:35:43,822 --> 00:35:51,019
Speaker 2: So in closing let me leave you with this when a hard winds a-blowing take heed and realize the storm she's a-coming.

573
00:35:55,661 --> 00:35:57,349
Speaker 1: So, let's see, what else is it?

574
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:03,600
Speaker 1: Oh the like the SVA and the Center for cartoon studies.

575
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:15,640
Speaker 1: So many tables of people who are from one of those two schools Might have even been approaching like 25 or even maybe maximum like 35 percent of the table.

576
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:22,180
Speaker 0: Of course, there are people from those places who reasons I think that this is is one SBA is really close.

577
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:26,940
Speaker 1: So it's like you have a Center for cartoon studies in Vermont and they had a whole row of tables in the back.

578
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,814
Speaker 0: Very true, but like SVA has always been there.

579
00:36:29,894 --> 00:36:36,035
Speaker 0: Like I remember the first Yeah, the first time I went to the mocha they had just the one table.

580
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:49,360
Speaker 0: like SVA take her free compilation of student work and this is really cool, but it's like You know people who weren't necessarily affiliated with the SVA table, but were SVA students.

581
00:36:49,842 --> 00:36:55,085
Speaker 0: there were a ton of folks like that mmm and Late lately.

582
00:36:55,105 --> 00:36:56,794
Speaker 0: I've just been like Oh SVA.

583
00:36:56,854 --> 00:36:57,779
Speaker 0: Why are you so good?

584
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:00,125
Speaker 1: There must I wonder like.

585
00:37:00,668 --> 00:37:07,988
Speaker 1: maybe if like even someone who has no arts whatsoever goes to that school Like they just turn you into awesome arts How much does it cost to go there?

586
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,092
Speaker 0: Lots of money.

587
00:37:09,132 --> 00:37:10,096
Speaker 0: It's a private school.

588
00:37:10,156 --> 00:37:13,494
Speaker 0: Not as much as NYU But not as well, I mean RIT is a private school.

589
00:37:13,514 --> 00:37:14,399
Speaker 1: Is it the same as RIT?

590
00:37:15,882 --> 00:37:22,883
Speaker 0: I actually don't know what tuition for SVA costs, but they do have really good programs and I don't know.

591
00:37:23,244 --> 00:37:25,573
Speaker 0: It's it's fairly difficult to get in.

592
00:37:25,633 --> 00:37:42,210
Speaker 0: I think you have to have a decent portfolio If you're trying to get into art school In in place of an application essay and often in addition to the application I say you have to submit a portfolio and that's

593
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:46,895
Speaker 1: that's not like already college graduate and I'm old I don't know the high school anymore.

594
00:37:46,935 --> 00:37:47,600
Speaker 1: I still have to do that.

595
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:54,632
Speaker 0: You can look on the SVA website and see if you'd get accepted to one of their Anymore going back to college like FAFSA.

596
00:37:54,813 --> 00:37:55,900
Speaker 2: I gotta find one of those things.

597
00:37:56,061 --> 00:37:58,355
Speaker 0: It would be like that song from Avenue Q.

598
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,820
Speaker 2: So I bought this for our friend Scott Johnson, you know He's.

599
00:38:04,961 --> 00:38:08,747
Speaker 2: he's a politician like for real and he's really into politics independent of that.

600
00:38:09,187 --> 00:38:10,810
Speaker 2: and he said I can't come to the mocha.

601
00:38:11,321 --> 00:38:12,829
Speaker 2: I have something important that I can't skip.

602
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:17,410
Speaker 2: rim buy me Anything that you know, I would like.

603
00:38:17,851 --> 00:38:19,960
Speaker 2: and I found a guy who was selling.

604
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:29,413
Speaker 2: He has series one which I bought for Scott Johnson of black conservative trading cards Got some Clarence Thomas some Michael Steele Alan Keyes Condoleezza Rice.

605
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:30,857
Speaker 2: He's silkscreen these things.

606
00:38:30,877 --> 00:38:32,020
Speaker 2: They're pretty high quality.

607
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:33,787
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know silkscreening is really popular.

608
00:38:33,807 --> 00:38:37,380
Speaker 1: I bought this really awesome silkscreen motorcycle poster thing.

609
00:38:37,661 --> 00:38:40,980
Speaker 1: They were only like 60 something of them, but the guy silkscreen all of them by hand.

610
00:38:41,281 --> 00:38:44,199
Speaker 2: This is four color silkscreening - which is not easy to do.

611
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,765
Speaker 2: I suppose you have a fancy machine.

612
00:38:45,966 --> 00:38:49,740
Speaker 0: was that from the table with the cute girl whom whose brother made pixel art?

613
00:38:50,021 --> 00:38:50,905
Speaker 1: Yeah in the back left.

614
00:38:50,985 --> 00:38:52,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, she was nice.

615
00:38:52,431 --> 00:38:54,300
Speaker 2: Although the black no that wasn't from there.

616
00:38:54,761 --> 00:38:57,732
Speaker 0: No, no, the one I got the silkscreen of the motorcycle.

617
00:38:57,812 --> 00:38:59,237
Speaker 0: I was all like art deco.

618
00:38:59,298 --> 00:38:59,960
Speaker 0: That was really cool.

619
00:39:00,961 --> 00:39:06,151
Speaker 2: A couple of people went to buy that thing because you had you showed it to him or said hey I got this thing and they were sold out.

620
00:39:06,312 --> 00:39:12,040
Speaker 1: They were like, ooh Yeah, the I don't want to spend like too much time just going over like the list of things that we got.

621
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:17,170
Speaker 2: We'll do a separate because I got to say this really stood out.

622
00:39:17,631 --> 00:39:20,299
Speaker 2: someone wrote a play and just had it bound for sale.

623
00:39:20,701 --> 00:39:23,232
Speaker 2: That's not a comic.

624
00:39:23,333 --> 00:39:24,840
Speaker 1: he said there's a lot of stuff there.

625
00:39:26,061 --> 00:39:27,688
Speaker 2: You're the first person to even look at this.

626
00:39:28,029 --> 00:39:35,486
Speaker 2: It is called parens and when I showed it to our friend Conrad He said so what it's a play about lisp Nerds left.

627
00:39:35,707 --> 00:39:36,815
Speaker 2: Yes, no one else did.

628
00:39:36,956 --> 00:39:39,066
Speaker 2: no But I'll play it.

629
00:39:39,166 --> 00:39:40,531
Speaker 2: actually I'm excited about this.

630
00:39:40,571 --> 00:39:41,555
Speaker 2: and the other non-comic.

631
00:39:41,575 --> 00:39:42,358
Speaker 2: that was kind of strange.

632
00:39:42,438 --> 00:39:53,319
Speaker 2: Scott Bateman took a public domain Horrible movie took just the audio from it and just Animated a movie using that as the audio track and I bought the DVD.

633
00:39:54,482 --> 00:40:02,992
Speaker 2: It's an hour and ten minutes long and it says on the box 2009 71 minutes color mono Aspect ratio 133 bad acting.

634
00:40:03,012 --> 00:40:13,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's one of the warnings You know, what's really interesting is that last year right Randall Monroe had like the big-ass line, you know, but this year He wasn't there, you know who had the biggest line.

635
00:40:13,869 --> 00:40:15,980
Speaker 1: He'd beaten had this gigantic line.

636
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,742
Speaker 1: It was known as the beaten path Joke stealer.

637
00:40:21,003 --> 00:40:22,168
Speaker 1: you stole it from someone else.

638
00:40:22,269 --> 00:40:22,449
Speaker 1: Yeah.

639
00:40:22,489 --> 00:40:24,839
Speaker 1: In fact, you stole it from the guy who runs the mocha, right?

640
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:29,234
Speaker 2: I think he was either the head of the mocha mocha or the head of logistics.

641
00:40:29,636 --> 00:40:30,843
Speaker 1: It was like the festival He had.

642
00:40:30,863 --> 00:40:34,086
Speaker 1: I had a fancy festival director Yeah, but it was funny.

643
00:40:34,147 --> 00:40:37,000
Speaker 2: cuz we're standing in line to see Kate beaten and I hear the guy behind me.

644
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,454
Speaker 2: You know Scott and Emily and the rest of the crew.

645
00:40:38,474 --> 00:40:39,080
Speaker 2: They're all talking.

646
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:44,160
Speaker 2: I'm kind of half listening and he says well, I guess we're on the beaten path and his friends all left.

647
00:40:44,622 --> 00:40:50,132
Speaker 2: So I just turned to Scott Emily and I said, well, I guess we're on the beaten path We hadn't heard.

648
00:40:50,294 --> 00:40:50,960
Speaker 0: so we are like.

649
00:40:52,745 --> 00:40:55,416
Speaker 2: I was like, I just totally stole your joke and he made all that laugh.

650
00:40:55,516 --> 00:40:56,279
Speaker 2: and then they laughed.

651
00:40:57,423 --> 00:41:00,250
Speaker 2: Yes, it was a good joke For you.

652
00:41:00,451 --> 00:41:01,759
Speaker 2: Yeah, I should have told it to keep beating.

653
00:41:02,182 --> 00:41:03,106
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was still.

654
00:41:03,146 --> 00:41:06,100
Speaker 1: it was really interesting to see that she had this gigantic line.

655
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,276
Speaker 1: I mean she was there last year, but we didn't see her like.

656
00:41:08,376 --> 00:41:13,300
Speaker 1: we showed up But we noticed oh, this is her table and she wasn't there at the time and we never tried to see her again.

657
00:41:13,963 --> 00:41:21,260
Speaker 1: But it was just like wow that you know, it's like I knew that you know She's pretty popular and her stuff is high-quality, but I didn't realize she was that popular.

658
00:41:21,441 --> 00:41:23,831
Speaker 1: I know that that were that many, you know, like.

659
00:41:23,911 --> 00:41:25,036
Speaker 1: more so like dr.

660
00:41:25,076 --> 00:41:26,100
Speaker 1: Meningin dude is sitting there.

661
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:30,180
Speaker 1: He's got like a person coming up to him every, you know, a few seconds or whatever, but he doesn't have a line.

662
00:41:30,581 --> 00:41:33,370
Speaker 1: You know Wonder Marks in between Kate beaten and dr.

663
00:41:33,390 --> 00:41:34,072
Speaker 1: Meningin guy.

664
00:41:34,172 --> 00:41:34,393
Speaker 1: What's it?

665
00:41:34,513 --> 00:41:35,677
Speaker 1: What's that guy's name?

666
00:41:35,717 --> 00:41:40,269
Speaker 1: Chris Hastings, I think And you know, so Dave Malki's the Wonder Mark guy.

667
00:41:40,290 --> 00:41:42,960
Speaker 1: he's got people coming up once in a while just chillin doing his thing.

668
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,097
Speaker 1: He's there every year, right?

669
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:50,380
Speaker 1: We discovered him because of the mocha in fact You know and he's got someone coming up every once in a while and then Kate beaten is there with his mob.

670
00:41:50,641 --> 00:42:01,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like really which is kind of awesome because you figure only a couple years ago She started out on live journal and it was one of those instances where there was no real self-promotion or anything.

671
00:42:01,441 --> 00:42:04,977
Speaker 0: It's just kind of got mimetic Lee traded around and everybody.

672
00:42:05,278 --> 00:42:07,547
Speaker 0: Oh my god You gotta check these comics out.

673
00:42:07,587 --> 00:42:08,250
Speaker 0: They're hilarious.

674
00:42:08,270 --> 00:42:10,880
Speaker 1: I think it's the same phenomenon as xkcd, right?

675
00:42:11,120 --> 00:42:17,985
Speaker 1: It's like, you know your art which kind of art style you don't have, you know have or don't have It doesn't really matter.

676
00:42:18,066 --> 00:42:21,337
Speaker 1: as long as it's you know, it's good and your writing is really.

677
00:42:21,478 --> 00:42:22,180
Speaker 1: what is the winner?

678
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,003
Speaker 0: Different?

679
00:42:24,043 --> 00:42:25,692
Speaker 1: not that you know, her arts is amazing.

680
00:42:25,792 --> 00:42:27,280
Speaker 1: That's you know, but that's besides the point.

681
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:38,342
Speaker 1: It's like the style of the art really complements the kinds of job But it's like look, you know like the penny arcade art style can do just as well as the key beaten art style It does.

682
00:42:38,362 --> 00:42:42,728
Speaker 1: you can do any style as long as your style You know the stick figure art style of xkcd.

683
00:42:42,789 --> 00:42:46,223
Speaker 1: any style is good on the internets as long as you know You do it.

684
00:42:46,263 --> 00:42:51,377
Speaker 1: Well and your writing has to be there, you know Itself from the pack.

685
00:42:51,982 --> 00:42:56,661
Speaker 1: There are plenty of webcomics out there though that have like amazing like holy shit arts Like.

686
00:42:56,681 --> 00:43:05,812
Speaker 1: they look like art books, but no one reads them and they don't have big lines at the conventions because the writing is not You know world-changing, you know as it is with the three comics.

687
00:43:05,852 --> 00:43:07,196
Speaker 1: I've just mentioned and others.

688
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,489
Speaker 0: so One of the tables I spent the most money at was Lucy measly's table.

689
00:43:13,529 --> 00:43:23,700
Speaker 0: I think that's how you say your name, but Actually way back at the first mocha I went to I bought this funny little comic where a girl was talking to an apple and a snowman and a refrigerator.

690
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:27,754
Speaker 0: It was really quirky and cute and I really liked the style.

691
00:43:27,895 --> 00:43:29,380
Speaker 0: and then the next year I saw her again.

692
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:31,404
Speaker 0: I was like, oh, yeah I bought your comic and I bought.

693
00:43:31,705 --> 00:43:34,212
Speaker 0: she had a CD of ukulele songs and they were.

694
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:39,211
Speaker 0: they were really cute and happy and sometimes I would listen to them while I was doing chores and stuff.

695
00:43:39,753 --> 00:43:47,900
Speaker 0: And so it was weird because pre-mocha Raymond Scott and I had gone to see the RIT hockey game at a sports bar.

696
00:43:48,101 --> 00:43:50,972
Speaker 0: It was like an RIT alumni event and the car.

697
00:43:51,012 --> 00:43:56,191
Speaker 0: I know it was so sad But the comic store was right next door.

698
00:43:56,492 --> 00:43:59,464
Speaker 0: And so I was like, come on guys before we go to the subway Let's go comics.

699
00:43:59,484 --> 00:44:02,900
Speaker 0: and they were all like no, but they were doing some sort of event there.

700
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,627
Speaker 0: It was like a woman in comics event And she was there.

701
00:44:06,647 --> 00:44:09,263
Speaker 0: I was like, oh I remember you from the mocha Are you gonna be there?

702
00:44:09,323 --> 00:44:13,280
Speaker 0: and then I ran into her again at drink and draw like a lady and then again at the mocha.

703
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:15,349
Speaker 0: So I was like, oh, I've totally got to buy your books.

704
00:44:15,469 --> 00:44:17,157
Speaker 0: So I got two.

705
00:44:17,237 --> 00:44:25,940
Speaker 0: I got one that was a collection of all her old like Journal comics and stuff called radiator days and that one was really good.

706
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:30,769
Speaker 0: There was like a very wide range of subject matter and styles in it And it was.

707
00:44:30,931 --> 00:44:39,955
Speaker 0: it was kind of a bummer though Because it was something I would totally give to my mom except that there were like three pages of porn Right smack dab in the middle of the book.

708
00:44:39,995 --> 00:44:43,247
Speaker 0: So it's like Situation really.

709
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:45,220
Speaker 0: it was like they were all individual stories.

710
00:44:45,361 --> 00:44:54,336
Speaker 0: It's just one or two of the stories happened to be rated X, you know, and so it was like Give this to all sorts of people, but there's a little bit of porn it.

711
00:44:54,577 --> 00:44:54,999
Speaker 1: How about that?

712
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,791
Speaker 0: So you have to be okay with that sci-fi yaoi.

713
00:44:58,132 --> 00:45:04,319
Speaker 0: Oh, I haven't read it yet You know, I picked up a card from it, but I was like sci-fi plus yaoi.

714
00:45:04,661 --> 00:45:06,994
Speaker 0: Maybe this will be a good webcomic, but the art looked.

715
00:45:07,154 --> 00:45:08,099
Speaker 0: the art looked very good.

716
00:45:08,522 --> 00:45:17,860
Speaker 0: So I was like if if I am gonna read a yaoi That looked like the kind of yaoi that would be interesting to me because it looked like a sci-fi story with plot and good art.

717
00:45:18,062 --> 00:45:22,768
Speaker 1: So I was like, hey You know if it was just sci-fi, I would read it.

718
00:45:23,350 --> 00:45:23,591
Speaker 0: Why?

719
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:25,940
Speaker 0: why does yaoi stop you from reading it Scott?

720
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:26,984
Speaker 1: Why would I want to read?

721
00:45:27,044 --> 00:45:29,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what if it's a really good story?

722
00:45:29,857 --> 00:45:30,580
Speaker 0: What if it's okay?

723
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,343
Speaker 0: What if it's not?

724
00:45:31,444 --> 00:45:33,072
Speaker 1: yaoi is like definition?

725
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:38,533
Speaker 0: I know I was going Going and explaining but say it's not yaoi.

726
00:45:38,593 --> 00:45:42,286
Speaker 0: say it's it's a homoerotic Sci-fi story.

727
00:45:42,828 --> 00:45:44,094
Speaker 0: would would you not read it?

728
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:45,520
Speaker 1: Isn't that sanctuary?

729
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:53,469
Speaker 1: Sanctuary is incredibly homoerotic.

730
00:45:53,509 --> 00:45:56,600
Speaker 1: It's definitely a work of fiction because politics is never that awesome.

731
00:46:00,521 --> 00:46:03,535
Speaker 0: Anyway, but I might give that a look and see.

732
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:04,459
Speaker 0: see how good it is.

733
00:46:04,862 --> 00:46:19,347

00:47:41,365 --> 00:47:49,308
Speaker 1: Ma, you know bust of mr T his head and you would put quarters in his top of his head and you could take any comic For these 50 cents and the.

770
00:47:49,408 --> 00:47:53,767
Speaker 0: I could you say no, even if the comic is bad I know and it was just 50 cents.

771
00:47:53,887 --> 00:47:55,915
Speaker 0: You get a pretty decent mini comic.

772
00:47:55,975 --> 00:47:57,360
Speaker 0: I got one called crazy lady.

773
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:58,408
Speaker 1: That was a good one.

774
00:47:58,448 --> 00:48:03,932
Speaker 1: I read that it was really good Jews not nearly as good really I didn't I?

775
00:48:04,112 --> 00:48:05,719
Speaker 0: the title made you choose it though.

776
00:48:05,941 --> 00:48:07,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, you had to get that one.

777
00:48:07,429 --> 00:48:09,240
Speaker 2: But crazy lady was actually pretty damn good.

778
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,495
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just basically the story about.

779
00:48:11,838 --> 00:48:18,157
Speaker 0: you know The the strange people that populate a neighborhood and this guy observing this lady who owes weights at the bus stop.

780
00:48:18,659 --> 00:48:18,799
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

781
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:22,108
Speaker 0: So there was also baba luba.

782
00:48:22,368 --> 00:48:29,144
Speaker 0: That was a good one too little tiny mini comic like tiny in size about This.

783
00:48:29,565 --> 00:48:33,540
Speaker 0: it's based on this lady's Russian grandma and she's very foul-mouthed.

784
00:48:33,580 --> 00:48:36,976
Speaker 0: It's like she reprimands pussies and tulips.

785
00:48:37,136 --> 00:48:40,252
Speaker 2: No bad catch About a couple of those little things like a bored angel.

786
00:48:40,272 --> 00:48:41,800
Speaker 2: It's just a bored angel for a few pages.

787
00:48:42,001 --> 00:48:45,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're just tiny tiny comics with no real plot.

788
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:49,859
Speaker 2: It's just you know funny little picture lumberjacks which came with a felt beard in it.

789
00:48:50,241 --> 00:48:56,717
Speaker 1: It's always funny how like the prices can like vary between Tables like there's no like standard price for a mini comic and it's almost like.

790
00:48:56,737 --> 00:48:58,961
Speaker 1: you know You'll see something like way awesome Like.

791
00:48:59,001 --> 00:49:03,480
Speaker 1: I bought this one way awesome thing called hobby and it's just the art style of it is like totally sweet.

792
00:49:03,902 --> 00:49:06,475
Speaker 1: But it's it, you know, it's a it's a relatively mini comic.

793
00:49:06,515 --> 00:49:13,909
Speaker 1: It's not the ultra mini It's just sort of like, you know, the digest dish size and it's only like ten or so pages But it's full color and it's really hard paper.

794
00:49:13,929 --> 00:49:16,700
Speaker 1: and the guy was like seven bucks and I was like, ah, really?

795
00:49:17,380 --> 00:49:24,059
Speaker 1: But I bought it anyway, but you know, it's like the other dude is like 50 cents for this, you know more You know for crazy lady, it's like come on.

796
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:25,625
Speaker 2: but those are the things I really look for.

797
00:49:25,645 --> 00:49:31,507
Speaker 2: because the stuff that like someone hand-bound themselves and stapled together and that they clearly Printed it at a Kinko's equivalent.

798
00:49:31,728 --> 00:49:32,149
Speaker 2: Yeah.

799
00:49:32,189 --> 00:49:34,919
Speaker 2: Yeah, because that's the stuff you're never gonna find anywhere else except at the mocha.

800
00:49:35,644 --> 00:49:36,872
Speaker 0: That's so is exciting.

801
00:49:37,596 --> 00:49:54,471
Speaker 0: and I I have to mention here's another one which the art wasn't all that great But for the price it got us like a great amount of laughs which was like poor poor angsty Hungarian and the poor poor angsty Hungarian.

802
00:49:54,792 --> 00:49:59,225
Speaker 0: was this story about this prince who gets Chased out of the castle?

803
00:49:59,385 --> 00:49:59,866
Speaker 0: it there's.

804
00:50:00,267 --> 00:50:08,896
Speaker 0: basically it was just random and it was weird and it would be like and that's Weathers whales in Lake, Ontario and and it's like aren't?

805
00:50:09,298 --> 00:50:09,660
Speaker 0: I know?

806
00:50:10,282 --> 00:50:11,245
Speaker 0: That's the whole point.

807
00:50:11,345 --> 00:50:12,810
Speaker 0: It was just random.

808
00:50:12,850 --> 00:50:13,432
Speaker 0: shit would happen.

809
00:50:13,472 --> 00:50:19,825
Speaker 0: and there was like the Hungarian prince and the Moldovan prince and they go around and have these inference.

810
00:50:20,165 --> 00:50:21,487
Speaker 0: Are you yeah.

811
00:50:21,728 --> 00:50:23,270
Speaker 0: Oh, no, then you should be vegetarian.

812
00:50:24,585 --> 00:50:26,720
Speaker 0: You needed to have soy and and stuff.

813
00:50:27,201 --> 00:50:31,635
Speaker 0: Anyway, it was just weird and just completely batshit random.

814
00:50:31,715 --> 00:50:33,280
Speaker 0: and so Nury and I were reading this.

815
00:50:34,342 --> 00:50:35,245
Speaker 0: You know, I bought this.

816
00:50:35,305 --> 00:50:40,603
Speaker 0: you have to read it Nury and she starts reading it and flip it and then she starts laughing and Laughing.

817
00:50:40,683 --> 00:50:44,040
Speaker 0: and so I think for the price paid that was that was well worth the money.

818
00:50:44,221 --> 00:50:53,780
Speaker 1: It's definitely, you know, you go around you look at these indie comics You're like, you know These are not like the professional high-quality amazing entertainment package that you would get, you know from pretty much anything.

819
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:55,539
Speaker 1: That's actually in a comic book store, right?

820
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:05,110
Speaker 1: But in terms of like the price per entertainment like the value, you know of what you're getting is like So much higher, you know for like 50 cents.

821
00:51:05,472 --> 00:51:07,200
Speaker 1: You can get something like crazy lady, you know.

822
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:14,487
Speaker 1: Or for a couple dollars you can get like, you know, friggin lumberjacks or actually that one little funky beer That one 24-hour comic.

823
00:51:14,527 --> 00:51:29,679
Speaker 0: I bought Catan the spider, which was actually what I think I kind of agree with you because it was it was very different and the art was very sketchy But actually what it portrayed was very imaginative and I liked little dragons, too.

824
00:51:30,482 --> 00:51:31,865
Speaker 0: I suppose I was swayed by that.

825
00:51:31,885 --> 00:51:34,231
Speaker 0: little dentists little dentists little.

826
00:51:34,432 --> 00:51:35,194
Speaker 1: so are we gonna?

827
00:51:35,455 --> 00:51:37,380
Speaker 1: are we pretty much gonna wrap this up?

828
00:51:38,643 --> 00:51:51,200
Speaker 2: We'll cut from here to a Various cavalcade of interviews and audio from the mocha floor and at some point in the near ish future We'll try to get up a video of the kind of unboxing and reviewing.

829
00:51:51,200 --> 00:52:04,497

844
00:52:44,274 --> 00:52:44,775
Speaker 2: why can't this?

845
00:52:44,815 --> 00:52:53,440
Speaker 1: the comic I buy look like that, you know part of being the artist you it's like you gotta You learn each time you get your thing printed.

846
00:52:53,641 --> 00:52:55,788
Speaker 1: But you got to learn what works and what doesn't.

847
00:52:55,849 --> 00:52:56,692
Speaker 1: what reproduces.

848
00:52:56,752 --> 00:52:58,619
Speaker 2: well on what doesn't you know as an artist?

849
00:52:59,200 --> 00:53:04,920
Speaker 1: I get really into like some of the dry brush But some of the more subtle dry brushing doesn't show up very well.

850
00:53:05,241 --> 00:53:05,804
Speaker 0: so you still

851
00:53:05,844 --> 00:53:08,255
Speaker 1: have to have your your pretty bold areas

852
00:53:08,295 --> 00:53:11,846
Speaker 2: of dark and light and You learn.

853
00:53:11,906 --> 00:53:13,317
Speaker 2: you learn what works and what doesn't.

854
00:53:13,377 --> 00:53:16,230
Speaker 2: yeah That's part of this is part of being a comic artist because you're not.

855
00:53:16,692 --> 00:53:20,120
Speaker 2: you're not doing it to display the originals You're doing it to be reproduced.

856
00:53:21,103 --> 00:53:22,406
Speaker 2: Part of the deal.

857
00:53:22,446 --> 00:53:24,251
Speaker 2: comics look like that.

858
00:53:24,632 --> 00:53:27,520
Speaker 2: Well, maybe for web comics you can do I guess you could.

859
00:53:28,502 --> 00:53:30,309
Speaker 2: But even then it's like people's screens.

860
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:34,690
Speaker 1: like, you know, some people's screens can't display all the colors So they don't have a lot of.

861
00:53:34,791 --> 00:53:36,079
Speaker 1: it's just basic design, too.

862
00:53:37,642 --> 00:53:49,685
Speaker 0: Okay, basically a lot of the words A lot of it is just basic design to you because even even if you have the highest resolution image you could possibly do It doesn't really matter.

863
00:53:49,745 --> 00:53:51,830
Speaker 0: your eye can only take so much.

864
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:57,613
Speaker 0: your eye wants to have areas to rest and wants areas for it to be led.

865
00:53:57,957 --> 00:54:01,816
Speaker 1: so If everything's is pretty detailed, but it's all the same tone.

866
00:54:01,836 --> 00:54:02,720
Speaker 2: It's just not going to work.

867
00:54:03,221 --> 00:54:08,700
Speaker 1: You need these areas of simplification even if it's an incredibly high resolution and high detail piece.

868
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:18,259
Speaker 1: So you always have to keep that in mind, especially in comic pages because so much is going on In individual panels, you still have to think of it as a whole thing.

869
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:27,431
Speaker 2: So larger, you know, it does well to officially just sell the like.

870
00:54:27,652 --> 00:54:29,880
Speaker 1: here's the ultra edition at the hellboy stuff and those be.

871
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:34,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, I. but the thing is though, like I love the small format.

872
00:54:34,613 --> 00:54:35,275
Speaker 1: I really do like.

873
00:54:35,295 --> 00:54:46,760
Speaker 1: I really do like small Like Comic guys, you know You know traditional comic fans miss that bigger or even the really bigger formats.

874
00:54:47,804 --> 00:54:49,459
Speaker 1: You know like Alex Ross did those really big?

875
00:54:50,180 --> 00:54:53,412
Speaker 2: Those big superhero comics and I was like, uh, they look good.

876
00:54:53,613 --> 00:54:56,805
Speaker 0: They look good obviously for painting like that But they're so in money.

877
00:54:56,845 --> 00:55:01,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just would rather have a little book, you know read on the subway or whatever.

878
00:55:03,368 --> 00:55:03,655
Speaker 1: That's you?

879
00:55:03,943 --> 00:55:06,897
Speaker 2: Definitely You gotta tell me about this.

880
00:55:08,281 --> 00:55:10,210
Speaker 2: So tell us a little bit about this movie.

881
00:55:10,391 --> 00:55:12,380
Speaker 2: The movie is called Adam age vampire.

882
00:55:12,661 --> 00:55:17,220
Speaker 1: I took the sound from a really old science fiction movie also called Adam age vampire.

883
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:18,345
Speaker 2: It's very bad.

884
00:55:18,365 --> 00:55:21,539
Speaker 1: took the sound and animated a new movie to it.

885
00:55:24,361 --> 00:55:25,586
Speaker 1: Hopefully there will be no more poop.

886
00:55:25,667 --> 00:55:28,277
Speaker 0: Yes, that's that's the hopes and the dreams of my.

887
00:55:28,860 --> 00:55:29,625
Speaker 1: no I wanted to do with three.

888
00:55:29,686 --> 00:55:31,579
Speaker 1: I wanted to be a trilogy from the beginning.

889
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:34,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm a regular George Lucas.

890
00:55:37,841 --> 00:55:43,094
Speaker 2: My name is Allison Braun and my comic is psychoanalytic and it's a photo collage comic.

891
00:55:43,735 --> 00:55:49,499
Speaker 2: and it's not your typical photo collage because I did a lot of printmaking and all the backgrounds and

892
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:57,206
Speaker 1: Basically what it is is I had a journal for like the last Ten years and I decided

893
00:55:57,547 --> 00:55:57,908
Speaker 2: to make it

894
00:55:57,928 --> 00:56:06,323
Speaker 0: into a comic and the journal is basically just me ranting which basically, the girl is Trying.

895
00:56:06,403 --> 00:56:14,359
Speaker 0: the girl in the comic is trying to just find her path and figure out her place in the world And that's that's pretty much what it's about.

896
00:56:15,723 --> 00:56:17,999
Speaker 0: My name is Ross wood Stoodler.

897
00:56:19,522 --> 00:56:40,908
Speaker 2: my new comic book is the Raven and the crayfish and It was inspired by Native American legends about Crater Lake national about Crater Lake National Park the area and a Monstrous crayfish that who is guardian of the lake.

898
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:49,090
Speaker 0: and it's an original tale featuring what happens when the mischievous Raven Tries to claim the lake and has to reckon with the crayfish.

899
00:56:49,672 --> 00:56:54,538
Speaker 1: and you can find more of my work at Ross wood Stoodler blogspot.com.

Speaker 1: and a lot of just

912
00:57:30,213 --> 00:57:30,735
Speaker 2: a quirky

913
00:57:30,775 --> 00:57:31,357
Speaker 1: characters that they

914
00:57:31,377 --> 00:57:31,799

Speaker 2: to work on.

917
00:57:37,724 --> 00:57:39,640
Speaker 2: So who should read saltwater taffy?

918
00:57:40,161 --> 00:57:46,940
Speaker 1: I think everyone should read it because When I say they're all ages it really I really did write it so that really anyone can enjoy the adventure.

919
00:57:47,462 --> 00:57:50,839
Speaker 2: I would say it probably starts at like age 8 and go and up.

920
00:57:52,042 --> 00:57:54,116
Speaker 2: But but I think that anyone can get something out of it.

921
00:57:54,136 --> 00:58:05,800
Speaker 2: Definitely Did you watch everything that the blockbuster had including the bad stuff like Armageddon and Doom Megalopolis?

922
00:58:06,364 --> 00:58:15,951
Speaker 0: No, no, I saw Doom Megalopolis on TV once though I had like a weird antenna channel and it just came in and I saw I think there's a scene where the guy was like Fish or something like that.

923
00:58:16,011 --> 00:58:21,703
Speaker 0: I was like 13 years old and I was like So it was.

924
00:58:21,783 --> 00:58:26,100
Speaker 0: it was kind of shocking but and then I that's actually how I got started reading comics too.

925
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:28,032
Speaker 2: It's because I love beautiful dreamer so much.

926
00:58:28,052 --> 00:58:29,240
Speaker 2: I went to the comic book store.

927
00:58:29,260 --> 00:58:32,259
Speaker 2: I was like find this for me and they happen to have.

928
00:58:33,061 --> 00:58:35,080
Speaker 2: They were calling it like return of the bomb or something.

929
00:58:35,361 --> 00:58:38,960
Speaker 2: That's when they were coming out on monthly issues and I went in every month and I would just pick it up.

930
00:58:39,120 --> 00:58:40,727
Speaker 2: I was like, I don't know who half these people are.

931
00:58:40,747 --> 00:58:41,571
Speaker 2: They're not in the movie.

932
00:58:41,591 --> 00:58:43,118
Speaker 2: I was like, why is she calling?

933
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:46,150
Speaker 2: That's weird But it was just all downhill from there.

934
00:58:46,371 --> 00:58:49,306
Speaker 0: And so when I saw that tour to Uniqlo, I was like, yes That's right here.

935
00:58:49,366 --> 00:58:55,516
Speaker 0: Like lung was my screen name on AOL back in like 95 or something like that.

936
00:58:55,536 --> 00:59:00,390
Speaker 0: So Sure sure, I do a comic called winters in Lavelle.

937
00:59:00,491 --> 00:59:07,060
Speaker 1: It's a fantasy adventure book for Young adults actually do it as a webcomic twice a week online.

938
00:59:07,961 --> 00:59:11,780
Speaker 0: It's it's about like a brother and a sister who gets stuck in another world.

939
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:13,808
Speaker 2: It's like kind of like Narnia, but with teenagers.

940
00:59:14,209 --> 00:59:16,939
Speaker 2: so you get like a lot of like teenage fighting and stuff like that, too.

941
00:59:17,205 --> 00:59:25,330
Speaker 2: so But it's it's I'm trying to do the kind of stuff that I liked when I was a teenager Like I loved like magic pack rare and stuff like that.

942
00:59:25,530 --> 00:59:26,995
Speaker 2: So that's that's what I'm going for.

943
00:59:27,035 --> 00:59:28,179
Speaker 2: It's like I want to do that again.

944
00:59:29,622 --> 00:59:33,058
Speaker 2: Did you watch the dub or the sub with the subtitles all the way?

945
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:36,339
Speaker 1: Openers in English with Sandy Fox.

946
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:38,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember that.

947
00:59:39,446 --> 00:59:41,955
Speaker 0: no, I'd actually been watching it at my anime club at that point.

948
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:45,059
Speaker 0: so I was like school And that was how I got into it.

949
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:48,513
Speaker 1: I was like the only person there who was in the target demographic for rare.

950
00:59:48,553 --> 00:59:53,785
Speaker 1: that was like 13 or 14 and I was like oh my god, and Everybody else there was like.

951
00:59:53,805 --> 00:59:58,100
Speaker 1: it's like older dudes who like sci-fi stuff, but like thinking back on it.

952
00:59:58,120 --> 00:59:59,346
Speaker 1: I think they just showed it for me.

953
00:59:59,387 --> 01:00:01,136
Speaker 1: They were like, all right, she sits through Gundam.

954
01:00:01,176 --> 01:00:01,940
Speaker 0: Let's throw her away.

955
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:07,880
Speaker 1: So and then it just like it just kind of made me want to do my own comics from that.

956
01:00:08,081 --> 01:00:11,899
Speaker 1: So it was like things like that really are kind of what got me started.

957
01:00:12,625 --> 01:00:12,867
Speaker 1: Sure.

958
01:00:12,927 --> 01:00:13,088
Speaker 1: Sure.

959
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:14,459
Speaker 1: My name is Casey van Hise.

960
01:00:15,681 --> 01:00:17,871
Speaker 0: My webcomic is winters in the Lavelle.

961
01:00:18,193 --> 01:00:19,057
Speaker 2: It's winters in Lavelle.

962
01:00:19,097 --> 01:00:19,398
Speaker 2: calm.

963
01:00:21,860 --> 01:00:25,620
Speaker 2: Patrick McQuade the artist of shapes the new brethren.

964
01:00:26,402 --> 01:00:29,232
Speaker 1: Steve Solis the namer of shapes the new brethren.

965
01:00:29,554 --> 01:00:30,316
Speaker 2: So what's going on here?

966
01:00:30,336 --> 01:00:31,300
Speaker 2: What does this you guys do?

967
01:00:31,541 --> 01:00:39,725
Speaker 2: well, what started in high school chemistry class back in the fall of 1994 has Evolved to the new brethren.

968
01:00:40,507 --> 01:00:42,974
Speaker 2: we did about 400 shapes in high school.

969
01:00:43,456 --> 01:00:57,008
Speaker 2: What happens is Steve You know in the back of ditto paper or whatever Withdraw a bunch of abstract shapes and then he would pass them off to me and I would create a character You know inside or inspired by that shape.

970
01:00:57,509 --> 01:01:01,300
Speaker 2: then I would pass it back to Steve and he would give that character a name.

971
01:01:02,042 --> 01:01:05,093
Speaker 2: So again, we did about 400 in high school and it kind of stopped.

972
01:01:05,595 --> 01:01:21,524
Speaker 2: and then in 2005 We reconnected via email and and via the posted postal service and you know, we did a whole new a new new batch and then And then the new brethren.

973
01:01:21,845 --> 01:01:35,089
Speaker 2: in the last six months we've done 34 new characters and Yeah, they are the new brethren and We have characters like Ramburger the Chancellor Stag, Willy and the Fronion man.

974
01:01:35,792 --> 01:01:42,575
Speaker 2: And the book is kind of like a whole shows all history and evolution of the process and documents the whole The whole.

975
01:01:42,696 --> 01:01:44,184
Speaker 2: you know the whole deal.

976
01:01:44,284 --> 01:01:51,353
Speaker 1: So yeah I Discovered my passion for cartooning right after 9/11.

977
01:01:51,353 --> 01:01:53,368
Speaker 2: as a turban and a bearded man.

978
01:01:53,569 --> 01:01:56,420
Speaker 2: a Lot of people know didn't know who six are.

979
01:01:56,440 --> 01:01:58,230
Speaker 1: so I was really a target of a lot of hate crimes.

980
01:01:58,752 --> 01:02:12,930
Speaker 1: but one thing that inspired me is a couple of cartoonists who actually Sketched six into their cartoons showing them as victims of hate crimes and I said, hey, that's interesting Maybe you know, there should be more cartoons about six.

981
01:02:13,010 --> 01:02:28,969
Speaker 2: So that's how it got started and that was almost eight years ago, and I came up with the idea of sick tunes Cartoon sick tunes and I basically take news items from around the world relating to six and Create a single usually single panel cartoons.

982
01:02:30,271 --> 01:02:45,385
Speaker 1: so a lot of the stuff you see here is from the last eight years this piece the I Call this the American turban chronicles collection and it's kind of like my experience and a lot of other people who wear turbans with a lot of it comes from ignorance.

983
01:02:45,405 --> 01:02:46,170
Speaker 1: people don't know who.

984
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:50,999
Speaker 1: People presume that everybody who wears a turban is Arab or Muslim, which is not true.

985
01:02:51,601 --> 01:03:01,450
Speaker 2: So this is my way of Also looking within our own community and making people think about our shortcomings and those kind of things.

986
01:03:02,112 --> 01:03:04,361
Speaker 2: So this is it looks like your first time at the mocha.

987
01:03:04,422 --> 01:03:05,406
Speaker 2: Yeah, are you having a good time?

988
01:03:05,426 --> 01:03:06,410
Speaker 2: Do you think the response is good?

989
01:03:06,790 --> 01:03:07,995
Speaker 2: I mean the response is great.

990
01:03:08,015 --> 01:03:13,476
Speaker 2: People are coming in and you know, they they haven't seen Turbans and beards in cartoons.

991
01:03:13,496 --> 01:03:14,179
Speaker 0: So they're really.

992
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:18,830
Speaker 2: they're kind of you know, they're really coming in and they're like wow I mean, so yeah, it's been a great response.

993
01:03:19,192 --> 01:03:22,269
Speaker 2: Plus I'm getting to see a lot of other people's work and it's quite amazing.

994
01:03:23,131 --> 01:03:25,287
Speaker 2: Vishwajit Singh Sick tunes calm.

995
01:03:26,471 --> 01:03:36,726
Speaker 2: My name is Morgan P L e and my website is Morgan writes a book calm and I do a quarterly Sci-fi anthology called indestructible universe quarterly which can be found on.

996
01:03:36,826 --> 01:03:43,471
Speaker 2: Morgan writes a book calm to buy and I also have a webcomic called driftwood, which is a horror comic and That's it.

997
01:03:43,812 --> 01:03:48,307
Speaker 0: Morgan writes a book calm over the rare bits comics collective and there's three of us.

998
01:03:48,448 --> 01:03:51,389
Speaker 0: I'm Jen Vaughn There's Sam car ba and Jason week.

999
01:03:52,691 --> 01:03:59,290
Speaker 2: We're all friends and cartoonists who have attended or are attending the Center for cartoon studies in the White River Junction, Vermont.

1000
01:03:59,713 --> 01:04:14,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, just about this whole row is all CCS kids and we all decided that we wanted to Control our own destinies with the webcomic and have a you know Instantaneous access to readers in a way that print comics sometimes takes longer to do.

1001
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:16,648
Speaker 0: So that's sort of the reason we all did this.

1002
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:21,750
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean you get back right away you start you can get it out to people and get responses for it.

1003
01:04:21,770 --> 01:04:26,670
Speaker 2: So it's really gratifying Like I've got a couple people who actually follow the comic and email me and I just care about it.
