Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

Speaker 0: Press your luck in a deep sea adventure.

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:22,618
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,926
Speaker 1: So, it got cold.

8
00:00:28,548 --> 00:00:29,733
Speaker 1: Which is also a problem.

9
00:00:29,753 --> 00:00:31,620
Speaker 1: that's not really a first world problem.

10
00:00:32,546 --> 00:00:35,550
Speaker 0: So today- Hey, cuz man I got some second world problems.

11
00:00:35,570 --> 00:00:36,879
Speaker 0: That Soviet block, ugh.

12
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,451
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I go today cuz it's cold.

13
00:00:40,893 --> 00:00:42,640
Speaker 1: Put on pants instead of shorts.

14
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:44,174
Speaker 0: I've been wearing pants lately.

15
00:00:44,194 --> 00:00:44,599
Speaker 0: You know why?

16
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,911
Speaker 0: The air conditioning's still on in my building.

17
00:00:46,951 --> 00:00:48,340
Speaker 0: It's like 60 degrees in there.

18
00:00:48,740 --> 00:00:50,848
Speaker 1: Oh, anyway, so I go to put on pants and you know what?

19
00:00:51,651 --> 00:00:53,457
Speaker 0: Pants are awful.

20
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:54,100
Speaker 1: Too big.

21
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:55,223
Speaker 0: Too big?

22
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:55,686
Speaker 0: You know why?

23
00:00:55,706 --> 00:00:57,900
Speaker 0: Cuz, well, I guess you haven't been biking as much, but you still bike.

24
00:00:58,202 --> 00:00:58,999
Speaker 0: You'll lose some weight if you bike.

25
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:03,660
Speaker 1: I mean, the thing is I've always weighed less at the end of summer than at the beginning.

26
00:01:03,781 --> 00:01:05,780
Speaker 1: That's just how bears work, right?

27
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:06,341
Speaker 1: Yeah.

28
00:01:07,083 --> 00:01:13,500
Speaker 0: I mean, I gained about five pounds like pretty much right after magfest is when that weight starts going away.

29
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,682
Speaker 0: But like magfest time?

30
00:01:15,384 --> 00:01:22,540
Speaker 0: That's like the death knell of my stomach cuz that is Thanksgiving, bonus Thanksgivings, of which there are several, Christmas.

31
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:26,236
Speaker 1: And it's not like, but it's like I bike less this year than any year, right?

32
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,300
Speaker 1: I mean, I didn't bike to work cuz, you know, they wouldn't let me bring my bike inside and such.

33
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:32,207
Speaker 0: Yup.

34
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:37,679
Speaker 1: So obviously I'm not exercising or dieting because I don't do that.

35
00:01:38,866 --> 00:01:39,560
Speaker 0: Well, you bike.

36
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,115
Speaker 1: I bike less than any previous year yet for some reason.

37
00:01:44,135 --> 00:01:45,160
Speaker 1: This never happened before.

38
00:01:45,901 --> 00:01:47,117
Speaker 1: I went to put my pants on.

39
00:01:47,364 --> 00:01:47,596
Speaker 1: Yup.

40
00:01:47,940 --> 00:01:50,929
Speaker 1: And it's not just like, oh, you know, they're a little.

41
00:01:51,029 --> 00:01:54,520
Speaker 1: it's like, no, I need to go buy pants that are one or two sizes smaller.

42
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,891
Speaker 1: I might have to like because I had the belt where you cut the.

43
00:01:57,454 --> 00:01:58,620
Speaker 1: I might have to like cut the belt.

44
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,280
Speaker 1: But then what if I do and I get fat later?

45
00:02:00,502 --> 00:02:02,053
Speaker 0: Wait, you got the fancy track line belt?

46
00:02:02,094 --> 00:02:02,840
Speaker 0: What kind of belt is this?

47
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's with the thingy.

48
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got four of them.

49
00:02:04,986 --> 00:02:06,800
Speaker 0: I got like one of every combination to the best.

50
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:08,395
Speaker 1: But it's like now I have to cut it.

51
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:11,313
Speaker 1: But if I have to uncut it, I can't do that.

52
00:02:11,334 --> 00:02:12,500
Speaker 1: I can only go in one direction.

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:21,360
Speaker 0: See, I've always had this rule that and this was a rule when I was a little kid that I would never, ever, ever buy pants with a bigger waist than the pants I currently wear.

54
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:24,200
Speaker 1: You're wearing the pants that are the same size when you were a three year old?

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,828
Speaker 1: Well, once I became a teenager/a little kid, though.

56
00:02:30,265 --> 00:02:30,871
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

57
00:02:30,891 --> 00:02:32,160
Speaker 0: So like 18.

58
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,309
Speaker 1: Sure.

59
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:37,397
Speaker 0: Once I hit my like, you know, in high school, I wore a 32 inch waist.

60
00:02:37,437 --> 00:02:38,100
Speaker 0: That was like my waist.

61
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:44,700
Speaker 0: And then after when I went to RIT, it went down to about 30 because I started like really exercising.

62
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,148
Speaker 0: And it's pretty much stayed around 30.

63
00:02:47,148 --> 00:02:48,916
Speaker 0: So I just only ever buy pants that are 30 or 31 tops.

64
00:02:50,381 --> 00:02:54,113
Speaker 0: And if I ever like can't put those pants on, I just won't wear pants.

65
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:55,357
Speaker 0: Like I got that weight.

66
00:02:55,497 --> 00:02:56,300
Speaker 0: That weight's got to go away.

67
00:02:56,641 --> 00:02:57,303
Speaker 1: But what do I do?

68
00:02:57,363 --> 00:03:00,473
Speaker 1: Do I have plenty of perfectly good pants?

69
00:03:00,734 --> 00:03:02,520
Speaker 1: and I was not planning to buy new pants.

70
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:07,371
Speaker 1: Should I just eat a bunch of barbecue instead of buying?

71
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:10,100
Speaker 1: Because I could spend my money on barbecue instead of pants.

72
00:03:10,902 --> 00:03:12,933
Speaker 1: And that might be a better deal.

73
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:14,200
Speaker 1: Right?

74
00:03:16,705 --> 00:03:17,048
Speaker 0: I don't know.

75
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:17,894
Speaker 0: You could just...

76
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,159
Speaker 1: Because pants are expensive and I had to buy all new pants.

77
00:03:22,962 --> 00:03:23,548
Speaker 0: Maybe it's time.

78
00:03:23,568 --> 00:03:24,820
Speaker 0: Maybe it's time to do a pants audit.

79
00:03:25,563 --> 00:03:27,451
Speaker 1: But I bought new pants even last year.

80
00:03:27,472 --> 00:03:29,400
Speaker 1: I have pants that are like a year old, perfectly good.

81
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,280
Speaker 1: Nothing wrong with them, except they're no longer my size.

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,280
Speaker 0: You could donate them to charity.

83
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:34,123
Speaker 1: Sure.

84
00:03:34,143 --> 00:03:37,260
Speaker 1: That's a lot of pants money that could have been barbecue money.

85
00:03:39,841 --> 00:03:41,948
Speaker 0: The thing is, I'd say that it might extend your life.

86
00:03:42,028 --> 00:03:45,840
Speaker 0: So if you buy new pants because you're in better shape and you stay smaller.

87
00:03:46,820 --> 00:03:47,904
Speaker 1: But I didn't even do anything.

88
00:03:47,964 --> 00:03:52,440
Speaker 1: Everyone else is like, people are trying crazy shit to lose weight and I didn't do shit.

89
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:54,747
Speaker 1: I just live as I normally live.

90
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:56,913
Speaker 1: And I'm not sick.

91
00:03:56,973 --> 00:03:59,260
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm losing weight because I'm diseased in the hospital.

92
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:06,040
Speaker 0: Maybe you do the thing that apparently, according to that TED talk, most Americans can't do, of you only eat when you're hungry?

93
00:04:06,361 --> 00:04:07,748
Speaker 1: I've done that my entire life.

94
00:04:07,828 --> 00:04:10,120
Speaker 1: It's not any different in the year 2016 than 2015.

95
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,125
Speaker 0: Are you hungry less?

96
00:04:11,145 --> 00:04:14,119
Speaker 0: Or maybe with Blue Apron you're eating better and cooking more and going out less?

97
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:18,120
Speaker 1: I only get Blue Apron not that frequently.

98
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:23,080
Speaker 0: Because we make three Blue Aprons a week and we eat out a lot less.

99
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,039
Speaker 0: Because I was looking through finance stuff, we eat out about half as often as we used to.

100
00:04:29,901 --> 00:04:30,263
Speaker 1: I don't know.

101
00:04:30,343 --> 00:04:34,620
Speaker 1: I mean, I could check my Grubhub order frequency, but I doubt that really makes that big a difference.

102
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:41,020
Speaker 1: I just ate like a giant slice of cake at work yesterday and didn't give a fuck, as usual.

103
00:04:42,062 --> 00:04:44,140
Speaker 1: There's actually been lots of cakes at work lately.

104
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:52,300
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, the thing is, you eat reasonably healthily, but it is known that for most of my life, I've eaten nothing but garbage.

105
00:04:52,882 --> 00:04:53,728
Speaker 1: Cookies.

106
00:04:53,748 --> 00:04:55,280
Speaker 1: You eat a whole package of cookies.

107
00:04:55,965 --> 00:04:56,659
Speaker 0: At RIT, too.

108
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:59,600
Speaker 1: When it's cookies, I eat one serving of cookies at a time.

109
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:04,499
Speaker 0: Scott would get things at Vienna Fingers and there were times when I would eat an entire row of them.

110
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:06,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would eat two or three at a time.

111
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,125
Speaker 0: How could you eat that few cookies?

112
00:05:08,306 --> 00:05:10,697
Speaker 0: When you eat one cookie, it's like cookie fugue.

113
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:11,260
Speaker 0: You just eat them all.

114
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,520
Speaker 0: You keep eating until there's no more cookies.

115
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:20,320
Speaker 1: I eat, you know, one serving of cookie or maybe two serving and then I have a bunch of cookie for later and I can eat servings of cookie every day.

116
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,256
Speaker 0: So for the first time...

117
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:26,260
Speaker 1: So even though, I mean, you eat a whole row at once, but I probably eat two rows over the course of a month.

118
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,900
Speaker 0: But I just buy another thing of cookies for the next day to ensure...

119
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:35,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're eating a whole, you know, store's worth in a month, but I'm eating a whole package in a month.

120
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:37,932
Speaker 0: I actually exercised some self-restraint the other day.

121
00:05:37,952 --> 00:05:38,776
Speaker 0: So basically...

122
00:05:40,121 --> 00:05:40,899
Speaker 1: You're capable of that?

123
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:42,870
Speaker 0: So yeah, this was kind of crazy.

124
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,820
Speaker 0: So the shnippers open next to my office, right?

125
00:05:45,581 --> 00:05:47,200
Speaker 0: Real hard to not just go there every day.

126
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,920
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a shnippers near me, but I go there pretty rarely.

127
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:52,219
Speaker 0: Well, it is like right there.

128
00:05:52,801 --> 00:05:53,397
Speaker 1: How close could it be?

129
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,419
Speaker 0: Like literally one block.

130
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,880
Speaker 1: Mine's like five, six, seven blocks.

131
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,920
Speaker 0: One tiny downtown block.

132
00:05:58,920 --> 00:05:59,900
Speaker 1: But they're all small blocks.

133
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,492
Speaker 0: You know those blocks that are like not even a block?

134
00:06:02,841 --> 00:06:04,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's one block like that.

135
00:06:04,609 --> 00:06:07,180
Speaker 0: I can almost see it from the window in our office.

136
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:12,200
Speaker 0: So I have not yet eaten a burger there because, you know, I eat burgers here.

137
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:14,471
Speaker 1: Actually, I think I've only gotten a burger at shnippers once.

138
00:06:14,511 --> 00:06:16,220
Speaker 1: I usually get the chicken sandwich with the good stuff.

139
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,879
Speaker 0: I got their sloppy joe last time.

140
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:19,940
Speaker 0: That's not something I'm making anymore at home.

141
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,456
Speaker 1: I made a sloppy joe from Blue Apron.

142
00:06:21,476 --> 00:06:21,780
Speaker 1: It was great.

143
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:22,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

144
00:06:22,862 --> 00:06:30,140
Speaker 0: So I go over there at like three o'clock because I walked downstairs and I'm like gonna get some coffee and I walk and I remember the shnippers there.

145
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:33,560
Speaker 0: So what I did is I went over there and just got a milkshake instead.

146
00:06:33,966 --> 00:06:34,319
Speaker 1: All right.

147
00:06:34,481 --> 00:06:35,670
Speaker 0: I was like, just give me a shake.

148
00:06:35,711 --> 00:06:36,880
Speaker 0: And she was like, what kind of burger do you want?

149
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:37,928
Speaker 0: I was like, no, I just want to shake.

150
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,279
Speaker 0: And she was like, that's a good idea.

151
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:41,709
Speaker 0: And I took the shake up to the office.

152
00:06:42,011 --> 00:06:43,420
Speaker 0: And the crazy thing is I go upstairs.

153
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:50,220
Speaker 0: Literally every single person who works in our office because it's an open floor plan walks over like as I walk by, they're like, what's that?

154
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,645
Speaker 0: And I'm like, milkshake.

155
00:06:51,826 --> 00:06:53,212
Speaker 0: And they're like, milkshake?

156
00:06:53,734 --> 00:06:55,120
Speaker 0: Where did you get a milkshake?

157
00:06:55,901 --> 00:06:59,200
Speaker 0: And I was like, well, one, there's a Shake Shack across the street and two, shnippers.

158
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:01,180
Speaker 0: So now my entire office.

159
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,949
Speaker 1: Also, you could just there's a blender in our office.

160
00:07:02,989 --> 00:07:05,140
Speaker 1: I could get ice cream and milk and just make them.

161
00:07:05,521 --> 00:07:05,762
Speaker 0: Yeah.

162
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:11,220
Speaker 0: So my office, I one day like I wanted some coffee and I showed up early, like before the ops team and everyone shows up.

163
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:16,300
Speaker 0: So I go over to that coffee maker that they make coffee in and I opened it to make coffee.

164
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:20,979
Speaker 0: And the coffee from the previous Friday was still in there, all moldy.

165
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,340
Speaker 0: And then I realized that they never clean that thing ever.

166
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:27,260
Speaker 1: Oh, we have the pod thingy, which I've never used in my life because I don't drink poison.

167
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,294
Speaker 0: It makes coffee the opposite of poison.

168
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:29,899
Speaker 0: Coffee is good for you.

169
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,780
Speaker 0: There's serious evidence that it's mostly good for you.

170
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,600
Speaker 1: I think the problem with coffee is whether it's good for your health.

171
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,699
Speaker 0: Probably it's like spice once you start.

172
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,333
Speaker 1: The problem with coffee is I have a hypothesis.

173
00:07:41,414 --> 00:07:42,680
Speaker 1: Obviously, I don't have any evidence of this.

174
00:07:43,207 --> 00:07:43,739
Speaker 0: I'll hear you out.

175
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:50,480
Speaker 1: I think that the people with the attitudes of workaholism who like working are people who drink.

176
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:54,880
Speaker 1: I think if we got if we eliminated coffee from Earth, everyone would be like me and just want to go to the beach.

177
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,426
Speaker 0: So it's got two counterpoints.

178
00:07:56,447 --> 00:07:59,399
Speaker 0: during the rise of the Nazis, like during the war.

179
00:08:00,903 --> 00:08:04,599
Speaker 0: A good chunk of German society was high on meth all the time.

180
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,030
Speaker 0: And I thought something like Adderall and all the like they were.

181
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:08,813
Speaker 0: that was like.

182
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:10,640
Speaker 0: that was the let's be productive.

183
00:08:10,801 --> 00:08:12,115
Speaker 0: Fuck it mentality.

184
00:08:12,236 --> 00:08:12,459
Speaker 0: Sure.

185
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:15,708
Speaker 0: I drink a lot of coffee.

186
00:08:16,612 --> 00:08:18,159
Speaker 0: I do not want to work hard.

187
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:21,299
Speaker 1: You work harder than me.

188
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:22,478
Speaker 0: I would be on the beach.

189
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:23,958
Speaker 1: You work harder than me.

190
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:28,740
Speaker 0: The thing is, I would form a game studio on the beach, but I wouldn't do a lot of work at the game studio.

191
00:08:29,861 --> 00:08:32,960
Speaker 0: Say, you know, I do a little work is I'd make stuff happen.

192
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:33,998
Speaker 1: You're working harder than me.

193
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:34,859
Speaker 1: You're trying to do.

194
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,859
Speaker 1: You're putting effort towards working.

195
00:08:37,823 --> 00:08:38,700
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I have goals.

196
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,840
Speaker 0: My goal is to get to the beach.

197
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,159
Speaker 0: You have no path to the beach from where you are right now.

198
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,559
Speaker 0: I have a path to the beach that does not significantly impact my day to day life.

199
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:47,681
Speaker 1: Yeah.

200
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:54,600
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think I think if you eliminated coffee, you would not be able to go down that path.

201
00:08:54,881 --> 00:08:57,740
Speaker 1: If I eliminated coffee is powering your path vehicle.

202
00:08:58,064 --> 00:08:59,440
Speaker 0: It's powering my life vehicle.

203
00:08:59,821 --> 00:09:00,339
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

204
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,940
Speaker 0: It's like I said, it's like spice.

205
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:07,760
Speaker 0: Coffee gives you a minor superpower, but once you start using it, you pretty much have to keep using it for your entire life.

206
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,591
Speaker 1: I think it's bad.

207
00:09:08,651 --> 00:09:09,139
Speaker 1: Don't do it.

208
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,418
Speaker 0: It also tastes really good.

209
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:11,853
Speaker 1: It tastes like disgusting.

210
00:09:11,893 --> 00:09:12,500
Speaker 1: Just eat hot chocolate.

211
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,460
Speaker 0: You think a lot of things taste disgusting.

212
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:18,460
Speaker 1: It just like tastes like hot chocolate, but it's been like poisoned.

213
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,339
Speaker 0: Hot chocolate.

214
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:19,851
Speaker 1: Diluted.

215
00:09:20,581 --> 00:09:22,840
Speaker 0: It tastes really good, but they're two very different things.

216
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:23,322
Speaker 1: Yeah.

217
00:09:23,484 --> 00:09:24,090
Speaker 1: One of them is good.

218
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:25,160
Speaker 1: One of them is not good.

219
00:09:26,122 --> 00:09:30,020
Speaker 1: If they were similar, if coffee tasted like hot chocolate, I would fucking drink it.

220
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:37,380
Speaker 0: So I don't have any gaming news today because Scott has the gaming news I was going to do and my geek bite is part of the main bit.

221
00:09:38,082 --> 00:09:39,619
Speaker 0: But I do have a story.

222
00:09:40,465 --> 00:09:41,099
Speaker 1: Oh boy.

223
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,040
Speaker 0: So I play a lot of Overwatch as you guys know.

224
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Speaker 1: And nobody cares.

225
00:09:45,643 --> 00:09:46,659
Speaker 0: All the Overwatch people will.

226
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:53,760
Speaker 0: So last night, because the debate was on, we actually did an Overwatch and debate where we all watched the debate on one screen and played Overwatch.

227
00:09:53,921 --> 00:09:54,382
Speaker 0: Wow.

228
00:09:54,904 --> 00:09:57,494
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, this one bad thing wasn't enough.

229
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:59,020
Speaker 1: Let me do two bad things at once.

230
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,491
Speaker 0: Overwatch is literally the game you've been waiting for.

231
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:02,960
Speaker 0: You just won't play it for some reason.

232
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:05,687
Speaker 0: So anyway, that's not the story.

233
00:10:05,728 --> 00:10:06,751
Speaker 0: The story is the other day.

234
00:10:06,992 --> 00:10:07,735
Speaker 0: we're playing Overwatch.

235
00:10:07,936 --> 00:10:09,000
Speaker 0: We're playing it pretty seriously.

236
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:13,172
Speaker 0: And we're playing casual mode, meaning you can all double up.

237
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:15,340
Speaker 0: Like everyone could pick the same hero if they wanted to.

238
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:17,208
Speaker 0: It doesn't count for your ranking.

239
00:10:17,248 --> 00:10:19,240
Speaker 0: It's just fun, but still playing to win.

240
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,728
Speaker 0: Like we're playing, trying to win.

241
00:10:20,749 --> 00:10:22,360
Speaker 0: Occasionally we'll double up on heroes or whatever.

242
00:10:23,141 --> 00:10:24,911
Speaker 0: And we had a really good game with this group of people.

243
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:26,619
Speaker 0: They were really good.

244
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:30,380
Speaker 0: So like we play a game or two with them and then the next map starts.

245
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,917
Speaker 0: And I'm like, what if we all, like I go Bastion and someone else also goes Bastion.

246
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:35,620
Speaker 0: That's the turret guy.

247
00:10:36,181 --> 00:10:39,173
Speaker 1: And then someone's like, hey, Rem, let me tell you about an RPG character.

248
00:10:39,414 --> 00:10:40,880
Speaker 1: So we went into the dungeon.

249
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:44,951
Speaker 0: I don't know why you don't find Overwatch a wonderful game.

250
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:47,200
Speaker 0: Like I still don't understand why you refuse to play it.

251
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:51,720
Speaker 1: Even if, even if you were talking about the most wonderful game on earth right now, you're still telling me about your RPG character.

252
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:53,246
Speaker 0: Nah, so this is good.

253
00:10:53,648 --> 00:10:56,580
Speaker 0: So I choose Bastion and then someone else also picked Bastion.

254
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:58,365
Speaker 0: So I go to switch and then I'm like, wait a minute.

255
00:10:58,987 --> 00:11:00,954
Speaker 0: What if we all go Bastion?

256
00:11:01,215 --> 00:11:02,740
Speaker 0: Which is usually kind of a weird Dick move.

257
00:11:03,421 --> 00:11:04,263
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

258
00:11:04,283 --> 00:11:05,968
Speaker 1: What if you did?

259
00:11:05,988 --> 00:11:08,174
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, I don't.

260
00:11:08,275 --> 00:11:08,716
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

261
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:09,478
Speaker 1: That's too crazy.

262
00:11:09,498 --> 00:11:10,100
Speaker 1: That's crazy.

263
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:11,223
Speaker 0: It's pretty funny.

264
00:11:11,524 --> 00:11:12,528
Speaker 1: So it's secret.

265
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:15,300
Speaker 0: The other team doesn't know what you've picked until they see you.

266
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:21,180
Speaker 0: So we all go Bastion and we like set up and we're laughing to ourselves and being dumb and like, yeah, this is going to be fucking great.

267
00:11:21,461 --> 00:11:23,795
Speaker 1: And then the other team all goes something else.

268
00:11:23,936 --> 00:11:24,560
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

269
00:11:25,181 --> 00:11:25,362
Speaker 0: Yeah.

270
00:11:25,382 --> 00:11:29,540
Speaker 0: So the way it happened was we're sitting there Bastioned up and no one attacks us.

271
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,465
Speaker 0: And we're like, what's going on?

272
00:11:30,526 --> 00:11:31,008
Speaker 0: Where are they?

273
00:11:31,069 --> 00:11:31,310
Speaker 0: Why?

274
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:32,035
Speaker 0: Why aren't they?

275
00:11:32,055 --> 00:11:32,900
Speaker 0: Cause they were super serious.

276
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,820
Speaker 1: Oh it's legendary hall of fame material.

277
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,729
Speaker 0: So then someone's like, okay, I see a Reinhardt.

278
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:42,320
Speaker 0: I see, I think there's six Reinharts.

279
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,240
Speaker 0: They had independently, we both played a bunch of games in the room.

280
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:50,560
Speaker 1: I was playing a game and this guy, he picked rock three times in a row.

281
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,975
Speaker 1: And then I picked paper three times in a row.

282
00:11:54,216 --> 00:11:54,939
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

283
00:11:56,501 --> 00:11:57,786
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

284
00:11:57,806 --> 00:11:59,052
Speaker 0: It's a dumb baby game.

285
00:11:59,353 --> 00:12:00,799
Speaker 0: And this is a real game.

286
00:12:01,861 --> 00:12:08,180
Speaker 0: So they, but the fact that they chose to do the dumb thing, literally independently of us, the same round that we chose to do the dumb thing.

287
00:12:08,503 --> 00:12:10,039
Speaker 0: And they happen to be a counter of each other.

288
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:15,139
Speaker 0: And that match was one of the best matches of Overwatch I have had in a long time.

289
00:12:16,684 --> 00:12:16,905
Speaker 0: All right.

290
00:12:16,965 --> 00:12:18,051
Speaker 0: I guess you can continue by cause.

291
00:12:18,072 --> 00:12:18,836
Speaker 0: what are you playing still?

292
00:12:19,117 --> 00:12:19,580
Speaker 0: Hearthstone?

293
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,101
Speaker 0: Yeah.

294
00:12:20,201 --> 00:12:21,447
Speaker 1: Hearthstone and Pac-Man.

295
00:12:21,728 --> 00:12:22,310
Speaker 1: Yeah.

296
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:22,993
Speaker 1: Real games.

297
00:12:23,073 --> 00:12:23,877
Speaker 0: New Pac-Man.

298
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,791
Speaker 0: Single player games.

299
00:12:25,832 --> 00:12:26,378
Speaker 1: Game of skill.

300
00:12:28,181 --> 00:12:28,282
Speaker 0: Yeah.

301
00:12:28,322 --> 00:12:29,937
Speaker 0: Cause Overwatch is entirely a game of luck.

302
00:12:30,721 --> 00:12:35,580
Speaker 1: It's more, it's less skilled than Pac-Man, which is 100%.

303
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,040
Speaker 0: I would disagree with that significantly.

304
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,060
Speaker 1: Pac-Man is 100% pure skill.

305
00:12:39,261 --> 00:12:40,830
Speaker 0: Now Pac-Man is just a memorized game.

306
00:12:41,071 --> 00:12:42,037
Speaker 0: There's nothing going on there.

307
00:12:42,057 --> 00:12:42,580
Speaker 0: Just memorize.

308
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,342
Speaker 1: All right.

309
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:44,528
Speaker 1: Let's see you do it.

310
00:12:44,548 --> 00:12:46,920
Speaker 1: Cause the new one is definitely not a memorized game.

311
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:47,061
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:12:47,081 --> 00:12:47,971
Speaker 0: The new one I'm not even going to play.

313
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:48,658
Speaker 0: I didn't even buy it.

314
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:50,080
Speaker 1: It's not a memorized game.

315
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:52,813
Speaker 0: Cause I didn't even finish getting super good at Pac-Man CEDX.

316
00:12:52,874 --> 00:12:54,100
Speaker 0: I don't need more Pac-Man.

317
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,624
Speaker 1: Well, the new one is completely different.

318
00:12:55,725 --> 00:13:00,480
Speaker 1: I could, I only got two S ranks at the new one cause it's so balls hard and completely different in every way.

319
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,283
Speaker 0: All right.

320
00:13:01,404 --> 00:13:02,896
Speaker 0: So if it's not memorized, then what is it?

321
00:13:02,936 --> 00:13:03,360
Speaker 0: Just random?

322
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:03,815
Speaker 1: Skills.

323
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:04,846
Speaker 0: Well, like what?

324
00:13:04,907 --> 00:13:05,719
Speaker 0: What kind of skills?

325
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:10,240
Speaker 1: Uh, twitching skills, quick pattern recognizing skills.

326
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:10,732
Speaker 0: All right.

327
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,415
Speaker 1: Uh, keeping from, uh.

328
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,920
Speaker 0: So it's like a baby version of an FPS that tests a very limited skill set.

329
00:13:17,301 --> 00:13:18,486
Speaker 1: Oh, you should play it and see.

330
00:13:18,546 --> 00:13:18,908
Speaker 1: Let's see.

331
00:13:18,948 --> 00:13:19,069
Speaker 1: Yeah.

332
00:13:19,109 --> 00:13:21,800
Speaker 1: If it's such a baby game, let's see you play it and get some S ranks.

333
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,780
Speaker 0: And then you play some Overwatch.

334
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:24,080
Speaker 1: Let's see you even get some A ranks.

335
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,580
Speaker 0: Let's see you even get into the golds in Overwatch.

336
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:30,640
Speaker 1: Let's see you, you know, get even an A rank at Pac-Man.

337
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,253
Speaker 0: You want to play some Doom Deathmatch?

338
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:32,920
Speaker 0: We'll see how that goes.

339
00:13:33,401 --> 00:13:34,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's not.

340
00:13:34,202 --> 00:13:34,464
Speaker 1: No?

341
00:13:34,564 --> 00:13:35,774
Speaker 0: How about some Quake 1 Deathmatch?

342
00:13:36,117 --> 00:13:37,061
Speaker 0: Quake 2?

343
00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:38,919
Speaker 1: Uh, Quake 1, you can't even aim up and down.

344
00:13:39,721 --> 00:13:41,279
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, you can.

345
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:43,182
Speaker 1: No.

346
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:45,227
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

347
00:13:45,569 --> 00:13:47,422
Speaker 0: Did you not play Quake 1?

348
00:13:47,422 --> 00:13:48,800
Speaker 1: I played plenty of Quake 1.

349
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:49,403
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

350
00:13:50,287 --> 00:13:53,360
Speaker 0: I think you, anyway, you got any gaming news?

351
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:55,819
Speaker 1: Dude, there's enormous gaming news, so.

352
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,998
Speaker 1: *yawns* Enormous real gaming news, so.

353
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,610
Speaker 1: The Philadelphia 76ers.

354
00:14:02,421 --> 00:14:05,079
Speaker 0: Why do we even care about, what, are they a baseball team?

355
00:14:05,621 --> 00:14:08,920
Speaker 1: They're the worst basketball team in the entire NBA.

356
00:14:10,742 --> 00:14:18,560
Speaker 1: It's actually sad, because even though they're Philadelphia, and I would normally hate them, like the hated Phillies, the hated Eagles, I pretty much hate the worst.

357
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:25,099
Speaker 1: Every professional sports team in Philadelphia is the most hated, except for the 76ers, who are so bad.

358
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:29,640
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, I don't like basketball, so I don't really care, which also, which helps me hate them less.

359
00:14:30,482 --> 00:14:33,017
Speaker 1: And also, they're so bad, it's like, why would you hate them?

360
00:14:33,057 --> 00:14:33,540
Speaker 1: They're so bad.

361
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:37,178
Speaker 0: It's like when you see a puppy who's got a peanut butter jar stuck on his head, you're like, "Oh, poor

362
00:14:37,259 --> 00:14:37,500
Speaker 0: dog.".

363
00:14:37,520 --> 00:15:00,618
Speaker 1: But they actually, the history of the Philadelphia 76ers is actually a, you know, unlike, say, the history of the Eagles, a team that has never won the Super Bowl and is full of shitheads, or, you know, the Flyers, a team that has historically been full of shitheads, the Philadelphia 76ers have a great history, full of players that are legendary and respected, like Wilt and Dr.

364
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:03,505
Speaker 1: J. So, it's hard to hate on them.

365
00:15:03,545 --> 00:15:12,560
Speaker 1: But anyway, for every year recently, they have intentionally lost, or been accused, or they're intentionally losing, it's not even an accusation, everyone knows it.

366
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:17,300
Speaker 0: In order to win, the NBA- It's the opposite of Herm Edwards, it's play to win next year.

367
00:15:17,641 --> 00:15:24,365
Speaker 1: Right, but the thing is, they keep losing, and they keep going to the NBA draft to try to get the better draft picks, and they keep losing.

368
00:15:24,425 --> 00:15:27,800
Speaker 1: It hasn't helped them enough to where they've been able to become a winning team.

369
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:36,320
Speaker 1: So anyway, they have purchased, I don't even know the names or care, but they purchased some major esports teams, major ones.

370
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:43,300
Speaker 0: Let's see, so they bought Team Dignitas- I've heard of them, actually.

371
00:15:43,441 --> 00:15:44,500
Speaker 0: And Team Apex.

372
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:45,598
Speaker 1: I've not heard of them.

373
00:15:45,983 --> 00:15:47,960
Speaker 0: I don't know if I've heard of either one of them.

374
00:15:48,521 --> 00:15:53,500
Speaker 1: I've heard of- if you said Team Dignitas, I would say that is an esports team, I've heard of them.

375
00:15:53,540 --> 00:15:58,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that you think that, but if someone said a similar name, would you have this vague memory?

376
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I've heard of that.

377
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,518
Speaker 1: I have no memory of Team Apex.

378
00:16:01,182 --> 00:16:02,318
Speaker 0: I might have heard of them, I don't know.

379
00:16:03,701 --> 00:16:08,680
Speaker 0: I've never felt a compelling reason to actually follow any particular esports team.

380
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:17,079
Speaker 1: I basically just pick teams when I watch a particular esports- I think one of them could be a New York team.

381
00:16:17,921 --> 00:16:18,745
Speaker 0: Here's my heuristic.

382
00:16:19,107 --> 00:16:22,080
Speaker 0: I choose the team that acts like the evil team in the Mighty Ducks.

383
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:23,624
Speaker 0: Whoever play- or the Yankees.

384
00:16:23,644 --> 00:16:27,920
Speaker 0: Whoever's the most evil and trying to win, pushing the rules to their limit.

385
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,700
Speaker 1: So you're a fan of the New England Patriots.

386
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,689
Speaker 0: Yeah, fucking win the game.

387
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,019
Speaker 1: That's what I want out of my esports.

388
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,179
Speaker 1: The New York Yankees.

389
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:35,665
Speaker 1: Yup.

390
00:16:36,941 --> 00:16:38,099
Speaker 1: Where's your Yankees hat?

391
00:16:38,742 --> 00:16:39,859
Speaker 0: Because baseball's boring.

392
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,274
Speaker 1: Where's your Patriots?

393
00:16:41,335 --> 00:16:41,640
Speaker 1: anything?

394
00:16:42,982 --> 00:16:44,760
Speaker 1: How many players on the Patriots can you even name?

395
00:16:45,009 --> 00:16:45,280
Speaker 1: None.

396
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:47,360
Speaker 1: Can you even know the name of the coach of the Patriots?

397
00:16:47,620 --> 00:16:48,739
Speaker 0: Why would I even know?

398
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,819
Speaker 1: Because he is the greatest player of games alive.

399
00:16:53,001 --> 00:16:55,570
Speaker 1: And whether you're a fan of them or not, you must respect that.

400
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:58,600
Speaker 1: if he played settlers, we would be in such trouble.

401
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,388
Speaker 1: And we would be so fucked.

402
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:02,200
Speaker 1: We are lucky that man plays football.

403
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:04,699
Speaker 1: A game that we do not have to compete with him at.

404
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:12,940
Speaker 0: So this is actually kind of big news because it's not the only esports team that was bought.

405
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:24,460
Speaker 1: A day later, a group of people, including Magic Johnson and also the company that owns the Washington Capitals and a bunch of other Washington sports, bought other esports teams.

406
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,359
Speaker 1: So it's like- Team Liquid.

407
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,497
Speaker 1: I've heard of them.

408
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:39,140
Speaker 0: Sold a controlling interest of the team to a group of major investors under the ownership group Axiomatic, which itself, I think, let's see, blah, blah, blah.

409
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,699
Speaker 0: So Magic Johnson, I think they just have a stake in it?

410
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:48,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the way in professional sports, for example, sometimes you have a person who just owns a team completely.

411
00:17:48,321 --> 00:17:49,019
Speaker 1: It's just one person.

412
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:53,160
Speaker 1: But sometimes, for example, Magic Johnson, he doesn't own the LA Dodgers.

413
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:57,800
Speaker 1: He owns a large portion of a company that owns the LA Dodgers, among other things.

414
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:58,660
Speaker 1: Right?

415
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:04,160
Speaker 1: So he's like, you know, he can act like he's the owner and just go to the stadium and, you know, do owner things.

416
00:18:04,306 --> 00:18:04,434
Speaker 1: Yup.

417
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,725
Speaker 1: But he's not the sole owner.

418
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:13,359
Speaker 1: the way that, say, you know, Robert Kraft completely 100% owns the New England Patriots on his own.

419
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:13,939
Speaker 1: No.

420
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,945
Speaker 0: But anyway- So this is a big deal, but it depends on how they handle it.

421
00:18:17,986 --> 00:18:24,740
Speaker 0: because are they buying these teams just to explore the space and figure out, like, what esports are?

422
00:18:25,301 --> 00:18:30,480
Speaker 0: Are they buying these teams to brand them with other teams that they own or interact with?

423
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:35,900
Speaker 0: Like, will they rename one of these teams to the 76ers or the Philadelphia Somethings?

424
00:18:35,941 --> 00:18:36,880
Speaker 1: I don't think that is likely.

425
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:48,900
Speaker 1: But I think what's going on here is, number one, it's clear that they don't actually understand the space they're getting into because, like, you know, some of these leagues, like League of Legends, you know, there's like relegation.

426
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:52,580
Speaker 1: You could be buying a team and it's like that team could then become garbage.

427
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:53,650
Speaker 0: Yeah.

428
00:18:54,064 --> 00:18:58,600
Speaker 0: It's like- It's not like buying an NHL team where they're guaranteed to at least play the regular season.

429
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:07,300
Speaker 1: It's pretty high risk to buy an esports team if they're not like that because it's such an, you know, a nascent, you know, sort of league.

430
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:13,280
Speaker 1: It's like you're not- it's not like you're buying the Yankees or it's like a safe bet, you know, that this is an established franchise.

431
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:22,920
Speaker 1: You could be buying a team that will be worthless if, you know, one of those players get old and the good new players join some other team and then now this team is garbage, right?

432
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:27,840
Speaker 0: There also isn't like the existing structure of how to handle, like, player contracts, free agency.

433
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:34,449
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have these, like, established fan bases that are all stuck on one team no matter how good or bad that team is.

434
00:19:34,509 --> 00:19:42,400
Speaker 1: the way that, say, someone who lives in New York will be a fan of the Mets no matter how bad they are or how few weird series they win, you know.

435
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:45,979
Speaker 1: And the Mets will always play in the major league no matter how bad they are.

436
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:51,199
Speaker 0: Most esports players, like people who follow esports- And always sell a certain number of tickets no matter how bad they are.

437
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,526
Speaker 0: Almost no one I know who follows esports really talks about teams.

438
00:19:54,546 --> 00:20:01,700
Speaker 0: They talk about individual people on those teams or they just talk about particular games they watched in the game, like this esport that they care about.

439
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:06,098
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like, "Oh, that was an exciting match between Team A and Team B. I rarely see people have such-".

440
00:20:06,841 --> 00:20:14,300
Speaker 1: There are people who have this, but I think it's pretty rare that there are people who have such a strong allegiance to being a fan of one team no matter what.

441
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,500
Speaker 1: Like, they're gonna- their children will inherit fandom of that team.

442
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:22,357
Speaker 0: Now, for an organization like the 76ers, they could try to apply those techniques.

443
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,803
Speaker 1: I would buy the league and not the teams.

444
00:20:25,823 --> 00:20:37,460
Speaker 1: But anyway, the thing is that's, you know, interesting though is that despite their lack of sort of knowledge of esports, they've clearly recognized the viewership numbers.

445
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:42,260
Speaker 1: And that is why they feel this is a good investment and it's hard to argue against that.

446
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,860
Speaker 0: And I think this is gonna suddenly accelerate.

447
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,203
Speaker 1: The viewership numbers are huge.

448
00:20:45,223 --> 00:20:55,240
Speaker 1: It's like millions and millions of people watch these things more than are watching some of their sports and they recognize this and realize that at this time- Dude, I already think esports are bigger than baseball.

449
00:20:55,560 --> 00:21:06,660
Speaker 1: The price of an esports team is lower than its value, so it's a good investment even if those other risks come into play because it's way bigger than people realize it is.

450
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,484
Speaker 0: Well, there's so little money involved.

451
00:21:08,504 --> 00:21:14,199
Speaker 0: Say you buy a team and you just say, "Alright, I'll pay all the players a salary to be on the

452
00:21:14,239 --> 00:21:14,459
Speaker 0: team.".

453
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:18,050
Speaker 0: That's still less money than you would realize.

454
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:21,120
Speaker 0: Like, that is small change to an organization like this.

455
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can pay them less than you have to pay a basketball player.

456
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:33,060
Speaker 1: And meanwhile, they'll still be mad rich and the number of people watching it is gonna be more than some of your basketball games or many of your basketball games.

457
00:21:33,781 --> 00:21:39,510
Speaker 1: I mean, do more people watch League of Legends final world championship than watch NBA finals?

458
00:21:40,511 --> 00:21:41,573
Speaker 1: I bet maybe they did.

459
00:21:41,633 --> 00:21:46,280
Speaker 1: I haven't looked at the numbers, but I wouldn't bet either way because it's probably close.

460
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:53,937
Speaker 0: There's also a lot of ways this could go and I don't know what's gonna happen other than I think there's gonna be a sudden weird gold rush for teams.

461
00:21:54,178 --> 00:21:55,200
Speaker 0: I think that's gonna happen.

462
00:21:55,280 --> 00:22:01,333
Speaker 1: I think another major risk in esports in general is which game is hot, right?

463
00:22:01,353 --> 00:22:02,775
Speaker 1: Because Starcraft was the hottest.

464
00:22:02,836 --> 00:22:04,920
Speaker 1: and now League of Legends is where all the action is.

465
00:22:05,841 --> 00:22:15,236
Speaker 1: And League of Legends has been around a long time and it doesn't seem to be fading, but it's gonna fade at some point and another game is gonna take over.

466
00:22:15,437 --> 00:22:17,300
Speaker 1: It's not going to always be that game.

467
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,180
Speaker 0: Also, because those games don't get necessarily the constant updates.

468
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,048
Speaker 1: It could be five years, it could be ten years, it could be twenty years.

469
00:22:24,529 --> 00:22:28,220
Speaker 1: In my lifetime, it will fade and another game will become the major esports game.

470
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:37,632
Speaker 0: As soon as someone has a bigger interest in these esports than has come up the other two, the meta will collapse pretty rapidly.

471
00:22:37,872 --> 00:22:39,975
Speaker 0: Even in Overwatch right now, the meta collapsed.

472
00:22:40,235 --> 00:22:43,359
Speaker 0: There's only a few heroes that people actually play in the big times.

473
00:22:44,801 --> 00:22:46,684
Speaker 0: Imagine if they're playing like some MOBA.

474
00:22:47,165 --> 00:22:54,100
Speaker 0: The meta will just collapse immediately on one set of heroes, one set of strategies and the game won't be able to adapt.

475
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:00,920
Speaker 0: None of these games have the kind of depth that you can get from traditional sports because they rely still so much on physicality.

476
00:23:02,901 --> 00:23:07,420
Speaker 0: So, I don't know what their long-term goal is.

477
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:14,360
Speaker 1: Well, it's a hedge against the decline as old people die of the old sports dying and losing viewership.

478
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:22,840
Speaker 1: And when the young punk kids are the only viewership left, ESPN doesn't want to die because all the old people who watch real sports are dead.

479
00:23:25,602 --> 00:23:27,850
Speaker 1: So, ESPN already has an esports podcast.

480
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:30,560
Speaker 1: They're showing esports stuff on their network and on their stream.

481
00:23:30,980 --> 00:23:37,140
Speaker 1: It's like they need some kind of content when people aren't watching baseball and whatnot anymore.

482
00:23:37,942 --> 00:23:39,557
Speaker 1: So, they're like, "Well, we can get that esports

483
00:23:39,597 --> 00:23:39,860
Speaker 1: content.".

484
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,356
Speaker 0: See, if I were ESPN, I would be buying leagues now.

485
00:23:43,436 --> 00:23:44,240
Speaker 0: Buy entire leagues.

486
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,380
Speaker 1: Buy fucking games.

487
00:23:46,062 --> 00:23:47,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, buy games, buy leagues.

488
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,140
Speaker 1: Guys, nobody's bought like Riot, the company that owns League of Legends.

489
00:23:50,641 --> 00:23:53,140
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a big company that's going to be expensive to buy.

490
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:53,866
Speaker 0: Are they public?

491
00:23:53,886 --> 00:23:54,819
Speaker 0: I don't know much about Riot.

492
00:23:55,803 --> 00:24:00,080
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because there are still companies bigger than them who could buy them, right?

493
00:24:01,682 --> 00:24:04,200
Speaker 1: I'm sure Disney could buy Riot if it wanted to.

494
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:17,179
Speaker 0: If I were the VC guy or worked at ESPN or something and had any say in this, what I would do is buy leagues wholesale, buy game companies that make these kinds of games, and make bespoke games just for esports.

495
00:24:18,364 --> 00:24:20,300
Speaker 0: I would make a vertical monopoly.

496
00:24:23,083 --> 00:24:25,860
Speaker 1: I'd start making teams associated with geographic areas.

497
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:27,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's all fiddly-tackly.

498
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:34,260
Speaker 1: People have already started making college teams and it's happening, but it's not getting that much excitement yet.

499
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,419
Speaker 0: Well, the NCAA has to get involved there, I think.

500
00:24:36,781 --> 00:24:37,760
Speaker 1: They're not yet involved.

501
00:24:44,851 --> 00:24:48,346
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

502
00:24:48,367 --> 00:24:49,050
Speaker 0: What do you got for me?

503
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:50,195
Speaker 1: So there's this guy.

504
00:24:50,416 --> 00:24:51,000
Speaker 1: What's his name?

505
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,589
Speaker 1: I don't have my thing open right now.

506
00:24:52,952 --> 00:24:54,003
Speaker 1: But anyway, it doesn't matter.

507
00:24:54,063 --> 00:24:54,750
Speaker 1: This guy's amazing.

508
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,169
Speaker 1: He's been around for a year and I'm shocked.

509
00:24:57,991 --> 00:24:58,510
Speaker 0: Greg Cornell.

510
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,919
Speaker 0: He does not have more- Oh, no, that's the name of the-.

511
00:25:01,384 --> 00:25:02,030
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, Greg Cornell.

512
00:25:02,230 --> 00:25:03,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, his name is Gregory Cornell.

513
00:25:04,071 --> 00:25:07,630
Speaker 1: I don't know why he doesn't have more views and more subscribers.

514
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:09,196
Speaker 1: It's shocking to me.

515
00:25:09,558 --> 00:25:11,470
Speaker 1: It's unbelievable what this guy's doing.

516
00:25:11,470 --> 00:25:12,857
Speaker 1: It's like top-tier shit.

517
00:25:12,877 --> 00:25:15,250
Speaker 1: So what he's doing is reviewing board games.

518
00:25:15,370 --> 00:25:17,370
Speaker 1: The good kind of board games that we play, right?

519
00:25:18,191 --> 00:25:20,602
Speaker 1: And his reviews are okay reviews.

520
00:25:20,863 --> 00:25:26,010
Speaker 1: He's mostly showing you how the game works, which is actually really useful if you want to decide whether to buy the game or not.

521
00:25:26,551 --> 00:25:29,370
Speaker 1: The one that I watched, was it called Above and Below?

522
00:25:29,851 --> 00:25:31,310
Speaker 1: That looks like a pretty good game.

523
00:25:31,771 --> 00:25:37,650
Speaker 1: Oh, if I wanted to have a nice little action-taking competitive game, that seems like a cute one and has a nice theme.

524
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,868
Speaker 0: Well, actually, some of the videos that get a lot of views on our channel are the two.

525
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:45,890
Speaker 0: The one we did where we teach Zendo and then we just play it for a while, and the one where we teach T&E and then we play it for a while.

526
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:52,310
Speaker 1: This is an above-average game and is definitely an above-average game review analysis demonstration thing.

527
00:25:52,650 --> 00:25:58,190
Speaker 1: So the thing is, his video is not his face talking and it's not just bad shots of the game.

528
00:25:58,390 --> 00:25:58,806
Speaker 0: Like I do.

529
00:25:59,330 --> 00:26:09,170
Speaker 1: It is an extremely, extremely well-done stop-motion animation using only action figures that he then voices over.

530
00:26:09,310 --> 00:26:15,610
Speaker 1: They don't have mouths, so it's pretty easy, but I mean, as easy as stop-motion is, which is not easy at all, a huge pain in the ass.

531
00:26:15,870 --> 00:26:15,935
Speaker 1: Yup.

532
00:26:17,113 --> 00:26:18,961
Speaker 0: I went from "Hey, I could do this" to "Fuck.

533
00:26:19,001 --> 00:26:20,870
Speaker 0: no, am I never doing this" in about two seconds.

534
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:27,410
Speaker 1: And he's also done stop-motions of the pieces moving around to demonstrate how they move in the game and it makes it- That is the best part.

535
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:35,610
Speaker 1: It makes it so easy to understand how the game works when you have stop-motion of the pieces moving around and it's well shot and it's so good.

536
00:26:35,771 --> 00:26:39,070
Speaker 1: The tragedy is that- Why does he only have, like, no subscribers?

537
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:40,430
Speaker 0: He has, like, 800 subscribers.

538
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,810
Speaker 1: That is not, that is like, he needs, like, three more zeroes on there.

539
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:46,687
Speaker 0: Like, remember how Scott was like, "Don't back us on Patreon, back Neil

540
00:26:46,707 --> 00:26:47,190
Speaker 0: Cicierega.".

541
00:26:47,210 --> 00:26:47,706
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

542
00:26:49,275 --> 00:26:49,969
Speaker 1: Follow this guy.

543
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:58,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you listen to a Geek Nights board game episode, like this podcast, and you're not watching everything on this guy's YouTube channel, what the fuck?

544
00:26:59,134 --> 00:26:59,241
Speaker 0: Yeah.

545
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:00,050
Speaker 1: Seriously?

546
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:01,490
Speaker 0: Like, these videos are great.

547
00:27:01,710 --> 00:27:06,570
Speaker 1: Also, dammit, I can't steal that idea, but also, yeah, I would never would have stole that idea.

548
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:08,270
Speaker 0: We could steal that idea.

549
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,128
Speaker 0: Do you want to?

550
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:09,398
Speaker 1: No.

551
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:09,950
Speaker 1: Fuck no.

552
00:27:11,653 --> 00:27:13,090
Speaker 1: You want to sit there moving a piece around?

553
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:13,610
Speaker 1: Take a picture.

554
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:16,330
Speaker 0: I mean, I've- If a person has moved a piece, they can take a picture.

555
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:22,350
Speaker 1: We have all the necessary equipment to do what this guy does, perhaps even better, only we don't have the effort.

556
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:22,838
Speaker 0: Yup.

557
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:24,690
Speaker 0: What were you saying about coffee?

558
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,590
Speaker 0: Scott, if you drank some coffee, we could make this happen.

559
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:28,929
Speaker 1: If I drank coffee, yes, I would eat this guy's lunch.

560
00:27:31,351 --> 00:27:34,650
Speaker 0: So, you might have noticed, but I guess you wouldn't have.

561
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:43,786
Speaker 0: I stuck it at the end of the show a while ago, but I've been re-watching The Simpsons with Emily, so I've been off and on tweeting because we're watching season six, like really- The good shit.

562
00:27:45,274 --> 00:27:46,143
Speaker 0: It is- Yeah.

563
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:51,089
Speaker 1: The other day, I was getting the surround sound to work in VLC, and I pressed a play out of Star Wars.

564
00:27:51,371 --> 00:27:53,110
Speaker 0: That's a real dangerous idea, Scott.

565
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:53,382
Speaker 1: Oops.

566
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:54,009
Speaker 1: I Star War.

567
00:27:54,538 --> 00:27:55,150
Speaker 1: Two hours gone.

568
00:27:55,450 --> 00:27:57,830
Speaker 0: I remember that time at RIT, we showed someone was visiting.

569
00:27:58,070 --> 00:27:59,150
Speaker 0: I think it was Pete was over or something.

570
00:27:59,230 --> 00:28:00,390
Speaker 0: We're like, "Blah, blah, blah.

571
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:00,618
Speaker 0: Cowboy

572
00:28:00,639 --> 00:28:00,869
Speaker 0: Bebop.".

573
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:01,787
Speaker 0: He was like, "I've never seen Cowboy

574
00:28:01,808 --> 00:28:01,910
Speaker 0: Bebop.".

575
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:02,310
Speaker 0: I'm like, "All right.

576
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:02,870
Speaker 0: God damn it.

577
00:28:02,870 --> 00:28:05,727
Speaker 0: I'll watch the first episode right now, just so you know what the deal is,".

578
00:28:05,747 --> 00:28:07,268
Speaker 0: and then we watch the entire show.

579
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:07,519
Speaker 0: Oops.

580
00:28:07,750 --> 00:28:08,169
Speaker 1: Cowboy Bebop.

581
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:08,386
Speaker 1: Yup.

582
00:28:08,551 --> 00:28:09,068
Speaker 0: Just happens.

583
00:28:09,971 --> 00:28:12,549
Speaker 1: Luckily, I only Empire'd, and I didn't return, but maybe.

584
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:14,228
Speaker 1: I don't know.

585
00:28:14,350 --> 00:28:14,859
Speaker 1: I got nothing to do.

586
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,449
Speaker 1: when I get home.

587
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:17,090
Speaker 0: See, at least- The thing is, Empire's my favorite one.

588
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:17,910
Speaker 1: Is it so good?

589
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:18,159
Speaker 1: Yeah.

590
00:28:18,370 --> 00:28:19,208
Speaker 0: It's the best one, I think.

591
00:28:20,391 --> 00:28:22,469
Speaker 0: I think it's still- I like all three.

592
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:23,750
Speaker 0: Empire's the best one.

593
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,408
Speaker 1: That Hoffio.

594
00:28:24,796 --> 00:28:25,108
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

595
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:28,050
Speaker 0: As a kid, I was real obsessed with Hoff for whatever reason.

596
00:28:28,514 --> 00:28:29,189
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell you why.

597
00:28:29,390 --> 00:28:29,486
Speaker 1: Good.

598
00:28:29,551 --> 00:28:30,050
Speaker 1: You can go there.

599
00:28:30,070 --> 00:28:30,568
Speaker 1: I'm going to the beach.

600
00:28:31,052 --> 00:28:32,269
Speaker 1: It's the exact opposite of Hoff.

601
00:28:35,091 --> 00:28:45,388
Speaker 0: But unlike the daykillers we had at RIT, which were VHS tapes with episodes of The Simpsons with no commercials, openers, or closers, just rapid fire for eight hours, those would kill a day.

602
00:28:46,131 --> 00:28:57,049
Speaker 0: We're watching individual episodes, so the episode ends, and then I can continue with my life, but I watched the episode again where it's a parody of Cape Fear, which if you've never seen, that's a fantastic movie.

603
00:28:57,310 --> 00:28:58,130
Speaker 1: The Sideshow Bob episode.

604
00:28:58,514 --> 00:28:58,690
Speaker 0: Yes.

605
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:02,470
Speaker 0: But the episode is like a one-to-one parody of Cape Fear.

606
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:06,350
Speaker 0: It's one of the funniest episodes of The Simpsons ever for a lot of reasons.

607
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:11,269
Speaker 1: It's even funny if you haven't seen Cape Fear, because while I knew it was a parody of Cape Fear, I still haven't seen Cape Fear ever.

608
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:15,050
Speaker 1: All I know is that Cape Fear is some kind of action movie that is a lot like that Simpsons episode.

609
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:19,887
Speaker 0: It's more of a thriller than an action movie, but it's like- The Simpsons.

610
00:29:19,927 --> 00:29:22,509
Speaker 0: parodies are often like just a couple of references here and there.

611
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,850
Speaker 0: This one is like a one-to-one.

612
00:29:25,154 --> 00:29:25,890
Speaker 0: It's kind of crazy.

613
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:26,830
Speaker 0: But anyway.

614
00:29:27,811 --> 00:29:41,129
Speaker 0: So at the end, Bart asks Sideshow Bob to sing the entire libretto of the HMS Pinafore, and he does, and that's a plot point, and you get a bunch of snippets of him, Kelsey Grammer, actually singing the HMS Pinafore.

615
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:46,430
Speaker 0: So because of that, I knew what the HMS Pinafore was as a kid.

616
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,650
Speaker 1: I had never heard of the HMS Pinafore before seeing that episode.

617
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:50,206
Speaker 1: Me either.

618
00:29:50,751 --> 00:29:56,750
Speaker 1: And all I knew after watching that episode was, "Oh, it's a musical probably about a And it's probably long.

619
00:29:57,010 --> 00:29:57,950
Speaker 0: It's Gilbert and Sullivan.

620
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,410
Speaker 1: It's arguably the first- Oh, I know who they are.

621
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:00,740
Speaker 0: Yeah.

622
00:30:01,070 --> 00:30:02,030
Speaker 0: Do you remember which one's which?

623
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,049
Speaker 0: One did music, one did librettos.

624
00:30:04,811 --> 00:30:05,623
Speaker 1: I did not know that.

625
00:30:06,531 --> 00:30:10,150
Speaker 1: I thought they just sort of did every- I didn't know that there was like that kind of separation of labor.

626
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:21,030
Speaker 0: I just learned a lot about them over the last week because apparently the HMS Pinafore is way more important than you might realize, and it might be the first modern musical of any caliber.

627
00:30:21,271 --> 00:30:31,049
Speaker 0: But because of that Simpsons episode, the snippets of songs from the HMS Pinafore have been stuck in my head, and I cannot get them out.

628
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:35,489
Speaker 0: So I went on YouTube, and it turns out- You can just replace them with some other musical.

629
00:30:38,633 --> 00:30:39,648
Speaker 1: There's plenty to choose from.

630
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,429
Speaker 1: This is a little more- Might I offer some King and I?

631
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:46,910
Speaker 0: I think because of the motifs and the way this is put together- Some fiddling on the roof?

632
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:49,090
Speaker 0: It's catchier than Les Mis.

633
00:30:50,374 --> 00:30:51,688
Speaker 1: No, Les Mis isn't the most catchy.

634
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:54,750
Speaker 0: Remember that Seinfeld when George just keeps singing Master of the House?

635
00:30:55,272 --> 00:30:56,530
Speaker 1: That's the catchiest song in Les Mis.

636
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is more catchy than that.

637
00:30:58,710 --> 00:31:09,870
Speaker 0: But anyway, this is not a regular performance of the HMS Pinafore because videos of stage productions like that tend to be kind of bad or just not that engaging.

638
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:24,927
Speaker 0: This is sort of a review performance of all the music with narrations linking everything together that the BBC did in 2005, and it is of the highest quality, and you should watch the entire thing.

639
00:31:26,590 --> 00:31:29,769
Speaker 0: Also, if you don't get the stationary joke, I'll be very disappointed in you.

640
00:31:30,933 --> 00:31:31,890
Speaker 1: Is the whole thing on Spotify?

641
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,770
Speaker 1: There's a lot of musical soundtracks on Spotify.

642
00:31:34,271 --> 00:31:37,150
Speaker 1: You would be shocked at how many musical soundtracks are on Spotify.

643
00:31:37,490 --> 00:31:39,749
Speaker 0: I found Martin Garrah on there, so I'm not shocked at all.

644
00:31:40,916 --> 00:31:41,329
Speaker 1: Your fav.

645
00:31:42,312 --> 00:31:49,290
Speaker 0: I don't know if I particularly like Martin Garrah, but I definitely remember- Yeah, because it was very memorable.

646
00:31:49,790 --> 00:31:51,903
Speaker 0: It was like, "Try Hard Les Mis

647
00:31:51,903 --> 00:31:53,272
Speaker 0: 2.".

648
00:31:53,272 --> 00:31:54,410
Speaker 1: Oh, also it was your favorite.

649
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:55,389
Speaker 1: It was Jekyll and Hyde also.

650
00:31:55,653 --> 00:31:55,989
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

651
00:31:56,110 --> 00:31:56,889
Speaker 0: That one's legit good.

652
00:31:57,010 --> 00:32:01,270
Speaker 0: Well, that's the best concept for a musical that was never turned into a real musical.

653
00:32:02,110 --> 00:32:03,990
Speaker 1: You want to know some interesting trivia?

654
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:04,666
Speaker 1: All right.

655
00:32:05,231 --> 00:32:11,010
Speaker 1: So, Korea, I found out from watching so much Korean TV, they're obsessed with that Jekyll and Hyde musical.

656
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:11,729
Speaker 1: Really?

657
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:11,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

658
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:13,769
Speaker 1: What's that song, the main song from it?

659
00:32:14,856 --> 00:32:15,425
Speaker 0: "I Need to Know"?

660
00:32:15,896 --> 00:32:16,170
Speaker 1: Whatever.

661
00:32:16,411 --> 00:32:20,270
Speaker 1: It's like the one song from it, it comes up a lot.

662
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:21,730
Speaker 1: They'll sing it all the time.

663
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:23,030
Speaker 1: It's a long musical.

664
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:23,789
Speaker 0: What kind of song?

665
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:25,890
Speaker 0: Give me anything.

666
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:27,930
Speaker 1: I forget, but they sing it all the time in Korean.

667
00:32:28,412 --> 00:32:30,370
Speaker 0: Is it an angry guy singing about murder?

668
00:32:30,670 --> 00:32:34,010
Speaker 0: Is it a scientist guy singing all inspirational?

669
00:32:34,310 --> 00:32:35,830
Speaker 0: Is it a woman singing about memories and dreams?

670
00:32:35,872 --> 00:32:36,227
Speaker 1: I don't know.

671
00:32:36,410 --> 00:32:37,690
Speaker 1: They don't sing the whole fucking thing.

672
00:32:37,810 --> 00:32:38,708
Speaker 0: They don't sing any part of it?

673
00:32:39,431 --> 00:32:43,870
Speaker 1: They're basically just, they'd say the chorus part in Korean or whatever.

674
00:32:44,371 --> 00:32:45,407
Speaker 0: That still doesn't help me.

675
00:32:46,170 --> 00:32:49,330
Speaker 0: There's no "the main song" in Jekyll and Hyde.

676
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:49,889
Speaker 1: Hold on.

677
00:32:50,030 --> 00:32:53,530
Speaker 1: Let me look up the- In fact, depending on what version of it- Let me look up the tracklist.

678
00:32:53,651 --> 00:32:55,650
Speaker 0: It opens possibly with a different song.

679
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:58,370
Speaker 0: The old concept album was the "I Need to Know" song.

680
00:32:59,070 --> 00:33:00,030
Speaker 1: Let me look up the soundtrack.

681
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:00,810
Speaker 1: Musical numbers.

682
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,609
Speaker 0: There's a lot of musical numbers in it.

683
00:33:03,570 --> 00:33:06,670
Speaker 0: "Alive" is when Hyde is going crazy and about to go murder people.

684
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:07,410
Speaker 1: This is the moment.

685
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:08,210
Speaker 1: They sing that song.

686
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:11,770
Speaker 0: That song is real widely sung in the US as well.

687
00:33:12,133 --> 00:33:13,010
Speaker 0: You're hearing commercials.

688
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:16,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like they got a thing for it.

689
00:33:16,352 --> 00:33:16,807
Speaker 1: I don't hear them.

690
00:33:17,270 --> 00:33:21,210
Speaker 1: There's a lot of songs that they're way into, but that song comes up.

691
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:24,990
Speaker 1: It's come up on multiple shows, multiple times, constantly.

692
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:34,168
Speaker 0: The notable part about that song is that in the original concept album, the singer can hold a note longer than you would expect a human to be able to hold a note that loud, and it's kind of amazing.

693
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:35,250
Speaker 1: Eh.

694
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:35,895
Speaker 0: Eh.

695
00:33:37,252 --> 00:33:37,889
Speaker 0: I'm into that.

696
00:33:38,251 --> 00:33:39,407
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is the entire H.O.S.

697
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,030
Speaker 0: Pinafore.

698
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:40,364
Speaker 0: Enjoy.

699
00:33:41,693 --> 00:33:43,510
Speaker 0: In other news, we got no conventions till MAGFest.

700
00:33:43,750 --> 00:33:44,410
Speaker 0: We're actually working.

701
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:48,270
Speaker 0: I don't think we can say anything about it yet, but we're setting up the panels.

702
00:33:48,390 --> 00:33:57,910
Speaker 0: We're probably going to be doing The Grind, an updated version of what we did at PAX, and a brand new one on quitting, like from games and such.

703
00:33:58,233 --> 00:33:58,448
Speaker 1: I quit.

704
00:33:59,013 --> 00:33:59,130
Speaker 0: Yeah.

705
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:03,887
Speaker 0: You know, MAGFest is the con, unlike PAX, where we could do the joke where we just fucking walk out of the room.

706
00:34:05,471 --> 00:34:07,089
Speaker 0: It'd be real funny if we actually didn't come back.

707
00:34:07,992 --> 00:34:10,027
Speaker 0: I wonder if MAGFest would be mad at us if we did that.

708
00:34:10,654 --> 00:34:12,007
Speaker 1: I just walked out of the room and came back.

709
00:34:13,397 --> 00:34:13,929
Speaker 0: Oh, you're on video.

710
00:34:14,070 --> 00:34:14,525
Speaker 0: They'll know.

711
00:34:15,429 --> 00:34:15,543
Speaker 1: Great.

712
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:18,090
Speaker 0: It ruins everything.

713
00:34:18,190 --> 00:34:18,967
Speaker 1: I'll give everyone a finger.

714
00:34:20,190 --> 00:34:20,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's in there.

715
00:34:20,951 --> 00:34:22,330
Speaker 0: My camera is there.

716
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:23,310
Speaker 1: Will that get us kicked off YouTube?

717
00:34:24,341 --> 00:34:24,510
Speaker 0: No.

718
00:34:24,812 --> 00:34:25,710
Speaker 1: It's your YouTube account.

719
00:34:26,110 --> 00:34:27,650
Speaker 0: Unless I get my dick out, I don't think we'll be fine.

720
00:34:27,771 --> 00:34:29,850
Speaker 1: Oh, I can just get my dick out on your YouTube account.

721
00:34:29,909 --> 00:34:30,266
Speaker 1: That'd be great.

722
00:34:31,313 --> 00:34:32,929
Speaker 0: If you really want to, you're welcome to.

723
00:34:33,050 --> 00:34:34,489
Speaker 0: I'm just going to stop looking at this monitor.

724
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:47,685
Speaker 1: I mean, the only reason I actually wear clothes is A, warmth, B, protection from elements, and C, you know, it's like, I don't care if anyone sees my junk, but I think they got a nude beach respect because they don't want to see my job

725
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:48,690
Speaker 0: at a nude beach.

726
00:34:49,371 --> 00:34:58,190
Speaker 0: I might do a little bit of nude swimming, but I am never in my life going to risk a sunburn on the young master and his married gentlemen.

727
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:02,149
Speaker 1: Well, imagine, are you going to rub sun tan, you know, block on your junk?

728
00:35:03,072 --> 00:35:04,490
Speaker 0: Not while I'm at the beach.

729
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:11,749
Speaker 1: And the thing is, it's like, you know, I don't mind being naked at the beach, but I, I'm pretty sure other people don't want to see my junk, which is why I don't.

730
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:12,521
Speaker 0: Yeah.

731
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,270
Speaker 0: But I'm mostly protecting the boys.

732
00:35:14,470 --> 00:35:16,550
Speaker 1: If people told me like, Hey, Scott, we want to see your junk.

733
00:35:16,650 --> 00:35:21,589
Speaker 0: I'd be like, all right, if you want to also, you know, just getting older, they, they need a lot more support than they used to.

734
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:25,850
Speaker 1: So it's kind of unpleasant to have these DC brought that up multiple times.

735
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,730
Speaker 1: I think you're having some problems because I don't have these problems.

736
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:28,828
Speaker 0: It'll come.

737
00:35:29,878 --> 00:35:30,002
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

738
00:35:30,357 --> 00:35:30,530
Speaker 0: Yeah.

739
00:35:31,411 --> 00:35:33,509
Speaker 0: There'll be a little more room down there as time goes on.

740
00:35:33,770 --> 00:35:35,429
Speaker 0: I mean, you're younger than me, so you're not there yet.

741
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:37,629
Speaker 1: Three months, three months younger.

742
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:41,370
Speaker 0: So uh, yeah, we got nothing.

743
00:35:41,510 --> 00:35:46,110
Speaker 0: The book club book, which I assume Scott hasn't started reading yet because you have not updated the website.

744
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,290
Speaker 1: Well, I had to tell you something about the book club book.

745
00:35:48,370 --> 00:35:49,048
Speaker 1: So I haven't seen them.

746
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:55,050
Speaker 1: I, you know, I saw the movie twice in my think, but it was many years, many years ago that I saw it.

747
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:57,550
Speaker 1: So I don't remember too much cause my memory is not good.

748
00:35:58,211 --> 00:36:03,069
Speaker 1: But as I'm reading the book, like memories of the movie keep coming back, but I can't tell.

749
00:36:03,330 --> 00:36:08,889
Speaker 1: Are they real memories or are they, are they false memories with the actors and actresses from the movie?

750
00:36:10,237 --> 00:36:10,827
Speaker 1: I don't know.

751
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,808
Speaker 0: Well, I mean like I remember I fucking conflated this movie with some other movie.

752
00:36:15,848 --> 00:36:19,967
Speaker 0: that is in no way related to it, but anyway, uh, yeah, I started reading it.

753
00:36:21,174 --> 00:36:22,310
Speaker 0: So I guess you can update the website.

754
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:23,870
Speaker 1: I'm trying to update the whole website.

755
00:36:23,930 --> 00:36:24,607
Speaker 1: It's a pain in the ass.

756
00:36:25,131 --> 00:36:28,229
Speaker 0: You can at least make the post about the book club book.

757
00:36:30,291 --> 00:36:34,265
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, other than that, uh, I guess pack south is in the horizon.

758
00:36:34,465 --> 00:36:44,885
Speaker 0: distantly packs east is going to come up not too long after that, uh, then packs prime, uh, we're thinking about maybe going to gamer X, even if we don't do a panel of us go to it cause it's in New York.

759
00:36:45,832 --> 00:36:46,948
Speaker 0: So stay tuned for all that.

760
00:36:47,250 --> 00:36:49,990
Speaker 1: I still don't know if that's a thing that we're supposed to go to not being gay.

761
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:55,790
Speaker 0: I was invited to submit panels for it and it's not about gay games.

762
00:36:55,971 --> 00:36:58,650
Speaker 0: It's just a friendly convention.

763
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,688
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, that is primarily about games, but it's like I'm taking a ticket away from someone who is.

764
00:37:03,930 --> 00:37:04,769
Speaker 1: So it's like, is that right?

765
00:37:05,834 --> 00:37:06,685
Speaker 0: I don't think it sells out.

766
00:37:07,471 --> 00:37:09,649
Speaker 0: Well, that's pretty sure it doesn't sell out.

767
00:37:10,391 --> 00:37:18,589
Speaker 1: If you are a person who plays games of any kind and is of a non straight sexual orientation, you should go to this.

768
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:19,488
Speaker 1: Cause it's a good convention.

769
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:20,863
Speaker 0: Yeah.

770
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:21,930
Speaker 0: We will probably be there.

771
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:24,069
Speaker 0: It's a new, I'll go to pretty much any con that's in New York.

772
00:37:24,553 --> 00:37:27,210
Speaker 0: I mean, uh, there's that new anime con coming next year.

773
00:37:27,310 --> 00:37:28,350
Speaker 0: We'll definitely be at that.

774
00:37:28,510 --> 00:37:30,089
Speaker 1: I guess we'll go and see what the deal is.

775
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:32,930
Speaker 0: I think that was going to be a lot bigger and better than the much smaller one.

776
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:36,849
Speaker 0: We, I said we were going to go to, and then I forgot about the thing that was near the hotel near my work.

777
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

778
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:47,830
Speaker 1: The one where I was like, oh, I guess I clearly a garbage con, but I was, that was a weird day cause I walked out of my office and there was a cosplayer and I was like, oh, oh, and then I was like, oh right.

779
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:50,470
Speaker 1: Is that tiny shit convention anyway?

780
00:37:50,790 --> 00:37:50,962
Speaker 0: Yeah.

781
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,470
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah.

782
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,528
Speaker 0: Otherwise that's it.

783
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,350
Speaker 0: Patreon's going, we got YouTube channels.

784
00:37:56,710 --> 00:37:59,829
Speaker 0: This episode is streaming live on YouTube right now.

785
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,047
Speaker 0: So you could have watched this live, including all the stuff in between when we actually do the bits.

786
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,488
Speaker 1: You're better off not doing so.

787
00:38:07,530 --> 00:38:10,230
Speaker 0: So deep sea adventure.

788
00:38:12,153 --> 00:38:14,069
Speaker 0: This is a real simple game.

789
00:38:14,773 --> 00:38:17,230
Speaker 0: It's a Japanese indie tabletop game.

790
00:38:17,810 --> 00:38:26,549
Speaker 1: Our friend Chris has gotten obsessed with the Japanese board game industry, so he's getting lots of Japanese games and including this one, which is a good one.

791
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:27,989
Speaker 0: They're real hit or miss.

792
00:38:28,230 --> 00:38:31,010
Speaker 0: Like all games are like all indie type board games.

793
00:38:31,433 --> 00:38:32,990
Speaker 1: Some of them have amazing aspects.

794
00:38:33,070 --> 00:38:35,421
Speaker 1: Like there's a game called Buddha bevel, which is not a great game.

795
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:45,450
Speaker 1: It's basically just sort of like a vote who wins really fast, but the instruction manual is so gloriously hilarious in its English.

796
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:46,569
Speaker 1: It is amazing.

797
00:38:46,810 --> 00:38:51,350
Speaker 1: And also the concept God with your tower that is too tall.

798
00:38:51,774 --> 00:38:52,481
Speaker 1: You want to win the game.

799
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:55,250
Speaker 1: You have to build the tower of Babel.

800
00:38:55,351 --> 00:38:58,910
Speaker 1: That is the tallest, but isn't too tall because then it offends God.

801
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:05,570
Speaker 0: It's uh, I feel like there's a really good game there, but it didn't quite execute, but deep sea adventure final judgment.

802
00:39:06,072 --> 00:39:16,645
Speaker 0: Oh, so the other common theme I'm picking up on because I see other people complaining about this too, is that for whatever reason, Japanese indie tabletop people can't seem to write rules very well.

803
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:19,830
Speaker 1: I'm sure they probably well written some of them at least.

804
00:39:19,830 --> 00:39:27,490
Speaker 1: I mean, I've read multiple people in English can't write rules well, but I'm sure if we knew, you know, Emily read the rules, she could tell us a better ruling than the English.

805
00:39:27,690 --> 00:39:30,910
Speaker 0: So from what I have gathered, that does not appear to be the case.

806
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:36,090
Speaker 0: The rules are just not as tight as I would expect from a game in general.

807
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,410
Speaker 0: But Kickstarter games have the exact same problem.

808
00:39:39,992 --> 00:39:41,650
Speaker 1: I mean, games period have this problem.

809
00:39:41,790 --> 00:39:44,250
Speaker 1: People don't write game rules tightly and well.

810
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:47,646
Speaker 0: It seems like the only games that don't have this problem are the like.

811
00:39:47,887 --> 00:39:52,949
Speaker 1: the people who write game rules well are rules lawyers and rules lawyers are usually bad at designing games.

812
00:39:53,230 --> 00:39:56,650
Speaker 0: It's Rainer Canizia and a few other people are the only people who write good game rules.

813
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:58,349
Speaker 1: Or people with lots of editors.

814
00:39:58,870 --> 00:39:58,963
Speaker 1: Yeah.

815
00:39:59,171 --> 00:39:59,910
Speaker 1: At big publishers.

816
00:40:00,730 --> 00:40:02,050
Speaker 1: But even they fuck it up a lot.

817
00:40:02,170 --> 00:40:07,609
Speaker 0: Deep Sea Adventure is so simple and so quick and I always introduce it to people as the drowning game.

818
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:09,050
Speaker 0: It's a drowning simulator.

819
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:09,650
Speaker 0: Let's go.

820
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:10,290
Speaker 1: That's correct.

821
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,590
Speaker 0: Basically you get a bunch of, I mean, it has a conceit and the conceit is pretty funny.

822
00:40:14,991 --> 00:40:20,630
Speaker 0: You're a bunch of shithead treasure hunters who all hate each other, but you're also poor.

823
00:40:21,292 --> 00:40:23,690
Speaker 0: So you get together and rent a terrible submarine.

824
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:30,949
Speaker 1: You're all in the same submarine together with the same and you only have one air tank, but you want to get more treasure than the other people because you're not sharing on your turn.

825
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:31,730
Speaker 1: You're sharing the submarine.

826
00:40:31,870 --> 00:40:32,609
Speaker 1: You're not sharing a treasure.

827
00:40:32,791 --> 00:40:34,650
Speaker 0: There's a shared set of air on your turn.

828
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:36,610
Speaker 0: You go down and there's all these tiles.

829
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:37,550
Speaker 1: No one had.

830
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:38,910
Speaker 1: No one takes a tank with them.

831
00:40:39,010 --> 00:40:41,010
Speaker 1: Everyone's just got a hose connected to the submarine.

832
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,510
Speaker 1: So if you breathe too much air, you will kill everybody.

833
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:49,970
Speaker 0: So as long as you're going down and not picking up any treasure, a game just goes on forever.

834
00:40:50,130 --> 00:40:58,450
Speaker 0: Just do whatever you want and your options on the turn is you decide if you're going to continue going down or you're going to fucking bail and run back up to that submarine.

835
00:40:58,934 --> 00:40:59,890
Speaker 0: Then you roll some dice.

836
00:41:00,070 --> 00:41:07,110
Speaker 0: You roll 2D3 to figure out how far you move in the direction you chose and then you can choose whether or not to pick up treasure on that spot.

837
00:41:07,811 --> 00:41:09,648
Speaker 0: The treasures get better the deeper you go.

838
00:41:10,191 --> 00:41:17,990
Speaker 0: However, as soon as you've picked up treasure, every time it gets to your turn, the air goes down by the number of treasures you are holding, and that applies to every player.

839
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:19,810
Speaker 1: There's one more thing that makes it even worse.

840
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:23,550
Speaker 1: So if I'm holding one treasure on my turn, the air goes down by one.

841
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:24,749
Speaker 1: There's only 30 airs.

842
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:27,754
Speaker 1: If you got a lot of players, it's hard to 25.

843
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:28,609
Speaker 1: It's not a lot of errors.

844
00:41:29,072 --> 00:41:30,050
Speaker 0: Not a lot of errors at all.

845
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:34,827
Speaker 1: But anyway, uh, then, you know, when you roll the dice to move, remember it's 2D3.

846
00:41:35,670 --> 00:41:36,448
Speaker 1: You don't move a lot.

847
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:40,290
Speaker 1: You subtract one from your total movement for every treasure you're holding.

848
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:48,230
Speaker 1: So if I roll the best possible roll, a six and I'm holding two treasures, I only move four spaces molding two treasures and I roll a one or a two.

849
00:41:48,390 --> 00:41:54,829
Speaker 1: I don't move and my turn goes past the rules like to point out if you still use two air from holding two treasures.

850
00:41:55,851 --> 00:42:05,390
Speaker 0: And that is key because if the air runs out after the players turn and ended the air, anyone who's not on the boat drops all their treasure to the bottom of the ocean and dies.

851
00:42:06,316 --> 00:42:08,310
Speaker 0: And then you play again, you play three rounds.

852
00:42:08,810 --> 00:42:12,308
Speaker 1: The submarine goes back to the surface, so anyone who's in it survives even though they ran out of air.

853
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:21,230
Speaker 0: There's a little bit more about how you can just drop treasure and try to race back for the boat and how the lot like there's also positioning based on the other people.

854
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:24,969
Speaker 1: So when you move, if you step on someone else, you just sort of fast forward right past them.

855
00:42:25,471 --> 00:42:30,910
Speaker 1: So if there's a bunch of people in front of you, it's really easy to get to the bottom of the ocean quickly to get more fancy treasures.

856
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:35,850
Speaker 1: But if there's not a lot of people behind you, it's really hard to go back up to that.

857
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:40,106
Speaker 1: You need people in front of you, whichever way you're going to move quickly with a low roll.

858
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:46,830
Speaker 1: So you want people to be close to you, but in front of you on your way back to the submarine so you can get up there quickly.

859
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:53,690
Speaker 0: Now this game, if everyone knows how to play it, five minutes tops to play an entire game.

860
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,910
Speaker 1: The thing that takes the longest amount of time is the dice rolling.

861
00:42:56,150 --> 00:42:56,225
Speaker 0: Yep.

862
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:57,929
Speaker 0: Maybe 10 minutes.

863
00:42:58,951 --> 00:43:01,970
Speaker 0: Teaching the game takes about two minutes and people just kind of get it.

864
00:43:02,230 --> 00:43:05,970
Speaker 0: And everyone I've shown this game to, because I own it now, really likes it.

865
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:08,989
Speaker 0: Like everyone I've ever introduced this to and I had them play it, they just got.

866
00:43:09,009 --> 00:43:15,810
Speaker 1: really You can basically have all the fun of playing like infiltration is 90% of the fun of playing infiltration.

867
00:43:15,830 --> 00:43:18,190
Speaker 0: I hate to say it, I think this is better than infiltration.

868
00:43:18,610 --> 00:43:26,549
Speaker 1: I mean, because it's- Well, I think infiltration has some complexities and some, you know, meh parts, which make it sort of less pure and less good.

869
00:43:26,932 --> 00:43:30,110
Speaker 1: But it has a little bit more fun because it has extra bits like secrets.

870
00:43:30,190 --> 00:43:35,668
Speaker 0: Well it has the fun and the theme, but it also has this meta of, it always goes kind of the same way.

871
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,150
Speaker 0: There's only two options on how that game goes.

872
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:47,950
Speaker 1: But anyway, so yeah, you can basically have all, you know, I think in terms of fun per minute per dollar per unit, it's better than infiltration.

873
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:48,270
Speaker 1: This

874
00:43:48,311 --> 00:43:59,469
Speaker 0: is like the perfect bust it out while you're waiting for the last person to come back from the bathroom to start a real game or bust it out when you're at a con and the room closes in a half hour and you can just get one more game out of the

875
00:43:59,509 --> 00:43:59,590
Speaker 1: way.

876
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,330
Speaker 1: Or bust it out if you're on a literal submarine and you're divers.

877
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,430
Speaker 0: Bust it out like at the table at a restaurant.

878
00:44:07,491 --> 00:44:16,450
Speaker 0: So the thing I have noticed also is that when you play this game with people who haven't played it a bunch, almost everyone dies or everyone dies the first two rounds.

879
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:21,468
Speaker 0: This game, like everything's going fine and it's just, you know, it's a press your luck game.

880
00:44:21,571 --> 00:44:23,330
Speaker 0: So should I keep going?

881
00:44:23,451 --> 00:44:23,930
Speaker 0: Should I keep going?

882
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:24,549
Speaker 0: Everything's fine.

883
00:44:24,911 --> 00:44:28,329
Speaker 0: As soon as one person decides to turn back, all hell breaks loose.

884
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:31,849
Speaker 0: As soon as one person picks up two treasures, all hell breaks loose.

885
00:44:33,031 --> 00:44:37,230
Speaker 0: The game is all about leaving Scott to drown at the bottom of the ocean as fast as possible.

886
00:44:37,570 --> 00:44:41,310
Speaker 1: Hopefully you're not the one who's at the deepest part of the ocean when people start turning around, right?

887
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:47,569
Speaker 1: If you're at the deepest part of the ocean, you should turn around first so that you get, you know, it's like, I'm, I'm the deepest right now.

888
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:55,050
Speaker 1: I will grab a treasure, turn around and I'll get a pretty good role cause everyone else is right behind me and then I'll be on my way back and it'll be good times.

889
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:55,908
Speaker 0: I've had a strategy.

890
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:59,970
Speaker 1: If you're at the deepest part of the ocean and everyone else turns back and then it's your turn again.

891
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,330
Speaker 1: Now this is a big gap behind you.

892
00:45:01,430 --> 00:45:02,347
Speaker 1: It's like, wait for me.

893
00:45:02,611 --> 00:45:03,088
Speaker 1: And now you're dead.

894
00:45:03,270 --> 00:45:11,930
Speaker 0: If I'm way too shallow, like I'm near the submarine going down and other people have picked up multiple treasures, I just immediately turn around and pick up all the shit treasures on my way out just to try to kill everybody.

895
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:12,427
Speaker 1: Yeah.

896
00:45:12,610 --> 00:45:13,949
Speaker 1: There's plenty of strategies like this.

897
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:14,206
Speaker 1: Yeah.

898
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:17,350
Speaker 0: It's that there's, there's a lot of depth to this game.

899
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:27,630
Speaker 0: Oh, despite how simple it is and I really like it and it's just like if you, if you're the kind of person who plays board games with people, this is like a must have in your library.

900
00:45:29,010 --> 00:45:31,650
Speaker 0: So in general, I mean it's a press your luck game.

901
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:34,350
Speaker 0: It's one of, it's almost a pure press your luck game.

902
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:39,170
Speaker 1: There's plenty of press your luck games is like a, you know, fresh fish is a press your luck game in many ways.

903
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,550
Speaker 0: To a degree, but it's much more obscured and complex, right?

904
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:44,750
Speaker 1: The press your luck is only one aspect of it, right?

905
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:48,630
Speaker 1: But there's a no thanks is a press your luck game in many ways.

906
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:50,209
Speaker 0: Press your luck is a press your luck game.

907
00:45:50,310 --> 00:45:50,410
Speaker 1: Yeah.

908
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,367
Speaker 1: The game show on TV.

909
00:45:51,911 --> 00:45:55,189
Speaker 1: Except if you figure out the pattern and you're not, the luck component goes away.

910
00:45:55,510 --> 00:46:00,389
Speaker 0: And press your luck is also a core, like it is a mechanic, either core or just sort of part of the game.

911
00:46:00,450 --> 00:46:03,162
Speaker 0: Like it's part of way more games that you might realize.

912
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:04,810
Speaker 1: infiltration we just mentioned.

913
00:46:05,091 --> 00:46:17,768
Speaker 0: because all it really means is that you generally have the option like a real, usually a really simple dial where you can dial up your risk and it, yeah, and it dials up the reward at the same time.

914
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:18,168
Speaker 1: Yeah.

915
00:46:18,230 --> 00:46:23,130
Speaker 1: You can just, you know, a lot of games can buy reward potential with risk, right?

916
00:46:23,170 --> 00:46:29,850
Speaker 1: In most games out there, you know, you're always making these sort of decisions based on a risk reward analysis sort of thing, right?

917
00:46:29,911 --> 00:46:31,750
Speaker 1: Like aha, I've got three moves available.

918
00:46:32,011 --> 00:46:34,750
Speaker 1: There's the risky move that has a big reward.

919
00:46:35,093 --> 00:46:36,630
Speaker 1: There's a risky move with a shitty reward.

920
00:46:36,732 --> 00:46:37,429
Speaker 1: Forget that one.

921
00:46:37,731 --> 00:46:49,730
Speaker 1: And there's a conservative move with an okay reward and you can sort of choose to, but a press your luck game is different in that you can choose pretty much anywhere along the scale of risk and reward.

922
00:46:50,112 --> 00:46:54,230
Speaker 1: It's like a free roaming, you know, needle, not just concrete actions.

923
00:46:55,192 --> 00:46:58,170
Speaker 1: And you can, you know, keep pressing.

924
00:46:58,651 --> 00:47:04,089
Speaker 1: And then at some point you flip and you know, this is sort of this movement of increasing the risk.

925
00:47:04,330 --> 00:47:10,309
Speaker 1: And so you stop and turn around and give up on the risk, you know, like a dealer, no deal and things like that.

926
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:19,947
Speaker 0: Now, pressing your luck, like it's in most games where they realized or not like even wizard has a heavy press your luck mechanic or at least a component because once you're behind, you're not going to win.

927
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,610
Speaker 0: You can, you got to go for increasingly desperate strategies to try to catch up.

928
00:47:24,991 --> 00:47:28,630
Speaker 0: So you just dial the risk all the way up in the last round.

929
00:47:28,771 --> 00:47:30,369
Speaker 0: You're like, yeah, I'm taking 10 tricks.

930
00:47:30,550 --> 00:47:36,969
Speaker 0: You just go for it even though you've got almost no chance because that's a conventional heuristic of almost all games.

931
00:47:37,391 --> 00:47:46,410
Speaker 0: If you're losing, you want to increase randomness or take on additional risk to attempt to get a greater reward because you play conservatively and you're behind.

932
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:48,749
Speaker 0: You're guaranteed to stay behind.

933
00:47:49,391 --> 00:47:59,048
Speaker 0: Like you can't overtake someone with a conservative strategy if they're ahead of you because they're going to play a conservative strategy and at best you'll maintain your current negative lead.

934
00:47:59,090 --> 00:47:59,250
Speaker 1: Right.

935
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:04,670
Speaker 1: So the hallmark of a game that's specifically a press your luck game is the turnaround point.

936
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:12,410
Speaker 1: At which point do you stop increasing the, you know, it's like, okay, rim one out of two chance of making a dollar.

937
00:48:12,532 --> 00:48:13,229
Speaker 1: Okay, I'll do it.

938
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:13,710
Speaker 1: All right.

939
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:14,410
Speaker 1: Now you have to bet.

940
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,290
Speaker 1: You have to go all in on every bet or not bet.

941
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:20,470
Speaker 1: So the four chance, the next one is a lot of four chance.

942
00:48:20,550 --> 00:48:22,230
Speaker 1: The next one's one out of eight, 16.

943
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:27,868
Speaker 1: It's like, at what point do you say, all right, I'm just going to keep my money and I'm not going to go all in again.

944
00:48:28,198 --> 00:48:28,470
Speaker 1: Right.

945
00:48:28,832 --> 00:48:30,070
Speaker 1: How do you make this decision?

946
00:48:30,430 --> 00:48:39,292
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, you've already, you know, it's like obviously no matter what the odds are in any game, you're going all in on the very first bet, even if the odds are really small.

947
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:45,110
Speaker 1: because it's like, if you don't win the first bet, you're, you're zero, which is what you can't have less than zero.

948
00:48:45,554 --> 00:48:46,409
Speaker 1: It's like turn one.

949
00:48:46,670 --> 00:48:51,527
Speaker 0: Like a PR a pure conservative strategy and wizard would be to always bid zero unless you have wizards.

950
00:48:51,937 --> 00:48:52,190
Speaker 1: Sure.

951
00:48:52,410 --> 00:49:00,370
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, you're not going to like, you'll get your two points every round probably, but you're not going to win if anyone takes even, and you're also going to take tricks by accident.

952
00:49:00,631 --> 00:49:01,027
Speaker 1: Actually lose.

953
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:01,769
Speaker 0: Maybe.

954
00:49:02,431 --> 00:49:05,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's easier to avoid a trick than to take.

955
00:49:05,903 --> 00:49:09,530
Speaker 1: you would never in deep sea adventure or infiltration on the first turn.

956
00:49:09,772 --> 00:49:11,850
Speaker 1: Just leave and be like, Oh, back in the submarine.

957
00:49:12,059 --> 00:49:12,249
Speaker 1: Yup.

958
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:13,549
Speaker 1: That there's no reason to do that.

959
00:49:13,610 --> 00:49:20,769
Speaker 1: You might as well at least go out, get the first thing, you know, go in infiltration, go out, pick up one day to token and go back.

960
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:21,510
Speaker 0: So there's two things.

961
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:23,790
Speaker 0: On one hand it's, are you behind or not?

962
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:24,990
Speaker 0: Like the further behind you are.

963
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:25,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck it.

964
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:26,468
Speaker 0: Like full sail.

965
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:33,588
Speaker 0: But there's also the, before anyone has made a full declaration, like I step out and take a little more risk.

966
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:36,310
Speaker 0: And then Scott sees it took a little more risk and he also takes a little more risk.

967
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:36,968
Speaker 0: Like let's go.

968
00:49:37,150 --> 00:49:41,370
Speaker 0: Like this game is totally safe until someone starts picking up treasure.

969
00:49:42,671 --> 00:49:49,749
Speaker 0: So at what point do you pick up the treasure and be that guy who caused the game to enter the collapsing state?

970
00:49:50,351 --> 00:49:53,570
Speaker 1: You have to handle it because everyone else takes their turn before you take your turn, right?

971
00:49:53,650 --> 00:50:00,530
Speaker 1: So they could all turn back and then you're the last person to turn back, which could suck unless you're already the person who is in the rear.

972
00:50:00,891 --> 00:50:03,010
Speaker 1: In which case then it's kind of okay because you'll be right.

973
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:03,411
Speaker 1: This

974
00:50:03,451 --> 00:50:04,959
Speaker 0: is why in a lot of games you'll see,

975
00:50:05,019 --> 00:50:14,670
Speaker 1: so if you're all the way in the rear, you have to look at the layout of people based on the dice they've rolled and say, okay, if I roll, how likely is it that I will end up all the way in the front?

976
00:50:14,750 --> 00:50:18,429
Speaker 1: Because if that happens, everyone else will turn back and I'll be in deep shit.

977
00:50:18,912 --> 00:50:22,370
Speaker 1: So if I can sort of land in the middle of everyone, that would be okay.

978
00:50:22,470 --> 00:50:35,189
Speaker 1: I would go deeper, but if I can't do that, I should turn back now and leave them behind and make it harder for them to get back to increase, you know, and maybe take two treasures on the way back to make up for the fact that it didn't go as deep as they did.

979
00:50:35,451 --> 00:50:38,890
Speaker 0: Now it's a really satisfying mechanic and that's part of why I bring up deep sea adventure.

980
00:50:39,291 --> 00:50:57,130
Speaker 0: If you want to really sort of study how this works and what this does to bigger, more complex games like say infiltration, play the hell out of deep sea adventure because you'll see people, despite how really simple this game is, get surprisingly invested in it and that is like, that's one of the reasons why press your luck is such a powerful mechanic.

981
00:50:57,492 --> 00:50:59,150
Speaker 0: It causes you people to get invested.

982
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:07,409
Speaker 0: The more you've risked, even if you're not going to win anymore, like I've seen people play this game, everyone else turned back and someone else like in the third round is behind.

983
00:51:07,970 --> 00:51:08,246
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

984
00:51:08,350 --> 00:51:13,410
Speaker 0: They go way deep and sometimes they almost make it out almost, almost unlikely.

985
00:51:13,671 --> 00:51:21,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, but while there have been times, for example, where people who are trying to make it out, made it out faster than they thought.

986
00:51:22,251 --> 00:51:28,309
Speaker 1: So once they're out, they're not using up the air anymore and this person is like left outside and the only air they're using is their own.

987
00:51:28,659 --> 00:51:28,870
Speaker 1: Yeah.

988
00:51:28,970 --> 00:51:31,189
Speaker 1: They have complete control over what's going on.

989
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:34,948
Speaker 1: It's not like the other people can come out of the submarine and breathe some air and use it up.

990
00:51:35,230 --> 00:51:41,170
Speaker 1: So now they know exactly like whether they can get back or not, if they should put treasures down or pick them up or what.

991
00:51:41,914 --> 00:51:44,630
Speaker 1: And now they can score with like a really deep treasure.

992
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:53,970
Speaker 0: So some games like this almost have a sort of coalition building where there's the coalition of people who are continuing to press forward into deeper risk and the separate coalition.

993
00:51:54,070 --> 00:52:00,810
Speaker 0: These are just implied coalitions of people who are turned back, who have decided the risk enough and are bailing.

994
00:52:01,432 --> 00:52:05,690
Speaker 0: And depending on which of those is the majority is a big part of the dynamic of the game.

995
00:52:06,392 --> 00:52:09,830
Speaker 0: And then you'll see that exact same thing play out in infiltration, for example.

996
00:52:10,232 --> 00:52:13,050
Speaker 0: But there's all this other stuff sort of obscuring it.

997
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:19,589
Speaker 0: Like it obscures the risk reward, even though really infiltration, not much more deep than deep sea adventure.

998
00:52:20,110 --> 00:52:21,406
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a bit of randomness going on.

999
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:26,406
Speaker 0: A lot more randomness, but also like most of the things are not nearly as powerful as you'd expect them to be.

1000
00:52:26,851 --> 00:52:38,010
Speaker 0: And you're very rarely rewarded for going super deep, but the game rewards you with these other things like theme and mystery, and you really want to see what those cards are if you go deeper.

1001
00:52:43,771 --> 00:52:45,890
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

00:53:12,171 --> 00:53:15,070
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1009
00:53:56,343 --> 00:54:05,060
Speaker 0: For those of you who might not be paying attention to the Patreon, I read the entire first chapter of Castlevania II, Worlds of Power.

1010
00:54:05,500 --> 00:54:08,057
Speaker 0: I have multiple physical copies of this book by FX9.

1011
00:54:09,305 --> 00:54:12,280
Speaker 0: For the patrons only, I read Chapter 2.

1012
00:54:12,280 --> 00:54:16,119
Speaker 0: I'm going to read a chapter every week or so until I finish this book.

1013
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:18,406
Speaker 0: And that's a good thing.

1014
00:54:18,446 --> 00:54:24,060
Speaker 0: now, I'm just going to read these amazing Worlds of Power books to all of you who are supporting us on Patreon.

1015
00:54:24,640 --> 00:54:32,920
Speaker 0: So the weird thing I have for you today as a preview, even though this is otherwise only in the Patreon, is Chapter 2 of Simon's Quest.

1016
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:38,785
Speaker 0: It is titled, I believe, Simon, Chapter 2, Simon.

1017
00:54:44,871 --> 00:54:48,470
Speaker 0: "Hi Tim," said the cutest girl in junior high to Tim Bradley.

1018
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:53,729
Speaker 0: Janet Morrison told me you could give me some good tips on where to get discount rates on video game cartridges.

1019
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:57,150
Speaker 0: My brother's birthday is coming up and I need to buy him a nice present.

1020
00:54:58,190 --> 00:54:59,830
Speaker 0: Blink of chocolate brown eyes.

1021
00:55:00,231 --> 00:55:02,630
Speaker 0: A smile so brilliant it dazzled Tim's brain.

1022
00:55:02,771 --> 00:55:05,029
Speaker 0: From cerebrum to cerebellum.

1023
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:05,874
Speaker 0: Wow.

1024
00:55:06,750 --> 00:55:10,830
Speaker 0: He'd always liked Carol Jan since he'd started here at Howard Junior High last year.

1025
00:55:11,470 --> 00:55:21,287
Speaker 0: And though they shared homeroom and Carol was nice enough to acknowledge his existence, unlike the more socially conscious teenage females who shunned him, she'd never actually sought him out.

1026
00:55:21,790 --> 00:55:22,789
Speaker 0: For advice yet.

1027
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,041
Speaker 0: Tim Bradley looked around him at the rest of the homeroom class at the hand of the clock close to the 830 bell.

1028
00:55:29,311 --> 00:55:31,710
Speaker 0: How come everyone wasn't watching the momentous occasion?

1029
00:55:32,132 --> 00:55:36,709
Speaker 0: How come there weren't trumpets and firecrackers and streamers flying through the air just like on New Year's Eve?

1030
00:55:37,790 --> 00:55:42,129
Speaker 0: Um, well, Blockbuster Discount has a real good sale on them now, actually.

1031
00:55:43,230 --> 00:55:45,248
Speaker 0: Carol sure smelled nice, too.

1032
00:55:45,891 --> 00:55:48,150
Speaker 0: He realized he'd never been this close to her before.

1033
00:55:48,591 --> 00:55:50,810
Speaker 0: And it was not an unpleasant experience.

1034
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:53,310
Speaker 0: Tim Bradley didn't normally notice girls much.

1035
00:55:53,751 --> 00:55:56,690
Speaker 0: There were far more important things to be thinking about in his life.

1036
00:55:57,051 --> 00:56:03,170
Speaker 0: However, with her brunette good looks perking just inches from him, he certainly noticed Carol.

1037
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:09,590
Speaker 0: And it was an experience with every bit the excitement of a nervous moment in the middle of a game of Zelda.

1038
00:56:10,453 --> 00:56:11,328
Speaker 0: "Oh, good," she said.

1039
00:56:11,831 --> 00:56:14,110
Speaker 0: But then a small cloud dimmed her smile.

1040
00:56:14,633 --> 00:56:15,108
Speaker 0: "Oh, dear.

1041
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:20,710
Speaker 0: I haven't the faintest idea where Blockbuster Discount is," she smiled glowingly again.

1042
00:56:21,331 --> 00:56:25,229
Speaker 0: "I don't suppose you'd be willing to take me there this afternoon, would

1043
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:25,390
Speaker 0: you?".

1044
00:56:26,492 --> 00:56:28,990
Speaker 0: "Um, sure, sure, Carol.

1045
00:56:29,672 --> 00:56:31,509
Speaker 0: I'd be more than happy to take you there.

1046
00:56:31,932 --> 00:56:33,450
Speaker 0: It's not that far away from the school.

1047
00:56:33,790 --> 00:56:35,407
Speaker 0: I mean, it's so close that we could just

1048
00:56:35,468 --> 00:56:35,589
Speaker 0: walk.".

1049
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:40,930
Speaker 0: "Magnificent," she grabbed his forearm and squeezed it with enthusiasm.

1050
00:56:41,411 --> 00:56:46,223
Speaker 0: "See you at the flagpole outside the main entrance at 3 15 p.m It's a

1051
00:56:46,284 --> 00:56:46,509
Speaker 0: date.".

1052
00:56:47,472 --> 00:56:55,309
Speaker 0: She gave his arm another squeeze, and she was off in a flurry of skirt, fluffy blouse, swirling hair, and that wonderful flowery perfume.

1053
00:56:56,061 --> 00:56:56,469
Speaker 0: A date.

1054
00:56:57,451 --> 00:57:00,430
Speaker 0: A date with Carol Jantz, 8th grade beauty.

1055
00:57:01,250 --> 00:57:06,370
Speaker 0: It all sounded okay to Tim Bradley, especially since it involved video games.

1056
00:57:07,031 --> 00:57:08,989
Speaker 0: That was something he could talk about.

1057
00:57:09,531 --> 00:57:11,049
Speaker 0: He'd have problems with the other stuff.

1058
00:57:11,790 --> 00:57:17,030
Speaker 0: Still, it wasn't a date date, not like a movie at the mall or anything formal like that.

1059
00:57:17,471 --> 00:57:21,910
Speaker 0: It was just him and Carol going to Blockbuster's, looking for bargains, right?

1060
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:27,510
Speaker 0: But the way his heart was beating, you would have thought she'd asked him to the junior prom.

1061
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:29,029
Speaker 0: The bell rang.

1062
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:36,090
Speaker 0: Tim pucked up his books and drifted out into the hallway through the flow of noisy teams, elbowing and clomping toward first-period classes.

1063
00:57:36,570 --> 00:57:39,390
Speaker 0: The odor of chalk dust and floor wax filled the halls.

1064
00:57:39,890 --> 00:57:49,690
Speaker 0: Tim was fantasizing about kicking through a hot game of Double Dragon, Carol Jantz by his side, when he ran smack into Burt Alvin by the boys' room.

1065
00:57:50,533 --> 00:57:51,786
Speaker 0: "It was like running into a

1066
00:57:51,867 --> 00:57:52,129
Speaker 0: truck.".

1067
00:57:53,110 --> 00:57:57,570
Speaker 0: "Hey," said the 9th grader, frowning down on him from about 20 stories above.

1068
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:02,630
Speaker 0: Tim peered up at the heights from the level of Burt Alvin's chest to his chiseled features above.

1069
00:58:03,211 --> 00:58:03,435
Speaker 0: "Hey,

1070
00:58:03,516 --> 00:58:03,963
Speaker 0: Bradley.".

1071
00:58:04,499 --> 00:58:04,650
Speaker 0: "Huh?"

1072
00:58:05,452 --> 00:58:06,099
Speaker 0: "What's this about?

1073
00:58:06,139 --> 00:58:06,806
Speaker 0: a date with my

1074
00:58:06,867 --> 00:58:07,090
Speaker 0: girl?".

1075
00:58:07,898 --> 00:58:08,148
Speaker 0: "Date?

1076
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:09,075
Speaker 0: Girl?

1077
00:58:09,993 --> 00:58:11,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, as in female.

1078
00:58:12,335 --> 00:58:12,570
Speaker 0: Pretty?

1079
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:13,590
Speaker 0: Carol.

1080
00:58:14,830 --> 00:58:14,913
Speaker 0: Mine.".

1081
00:58:15,571 --> 00:58:19,510
Speaker 0: Each of the last four words was accompanied by a hard poke from the forefinger.

1082
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:20,428
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

1083
00:58:21,031 --> 00:58:21,630
Speaker 0: Tim had forgotten.

1084
00:58:22,490 --> 00:58:24,130
Speaker 0: Carol had a boyfriend.

1085
00:58:24,872 --> 00:58:26,049
Speaker 0: A big boyfriend.

1086
00:58:26,890 --> 00:58:28,910
Speaker 0: Maybe she was getting ready to dump him, though.

1087
00:58:29,431 --> 00:58:29,869
Speaker 0: No matter.

1088
00:58:30,270 --> 00:58:34,610
Speaker 0: Tim was still dead meat if Donkey Kong here thought he was trespassing on his territory.

1089
00:58:35,336 --> 00:58:35,585
Speaker 0: "Oh, that?

1090
00:58:35,992 --> 00:58:36,829
Speaker 0: Uh, gee, Burt.

1091
00:58:37,271 --> 00:58:39,027
Speaker 0: She just wants me to take her shopping for video

1092
00:58:39,048 --> 00:58:39,270
Speaker 0: games.".

1093
00:58:40,091 --> 00:58:43,549
Speaker 0: "The video jockey wants to ride off into the sunset with my girl, huh?

1094
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:44,909
Speaker 0: Well, pal, let me tell you.

1095
00:58:45,411 --> 00:58:49,189
Speaker 0: I'm perfectly capable of taking Carol to any store she wants to go to.

1096
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:54,084
Speaker 0: But I tell you, I feel like putting you out of commission just for thinking about going out with my

1097
00:58:54,146 --> 00:58:54,330
Speaker 0: girl.".

1098
00:58:55,235 --> 00:58:55,808
Speaker 0: "What to do?

1099
00:58:56,030 --> 00:58:56,300
Speaker 0: What to

1100
00:58:56,363 --> 00:58:56,446
Speaker 0: do?".

1101
00:58:57,256 --> 00:58:57,749
Speaker 0: "Look, Burt.

1102
00:58:58,253 --> 00:58:59,790
Speaker 0: I was just headed into the boys' room.

1103
00:59:00,090 --> 00:59:02,007
Speaker 0: Can we, uh, discuss this when I'm

1104
00:59:02,047 --> 00:59:02,330
Speaker 0: finished?".

1105
00:59:03,492 --> 00:59:04,709
Speaker 0: Burt glared at him.

1106
00:59:05,293 --> 00:59:06,268
Speaker 0: "Yeah, I guess so.

1107
00:59:06,691 --> 00:59:09,749
Speaker 0: I don't want you having any accidents while I'm pulverizing

1108
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:09,870
Speaker 0: you.".

1109
00:59:10,612 --> 00:59:12,310
Speaker 0: "That's, uh, very thoughtful of you, Burt.

1110
00:59:12,650 --> 00:59:14,604
Speaker 0: Which reminds me of a funny joke I heard the other

1111
00:59:14,625 --> 00:59:14,826
Speaker 0: day.".

1112
00:59:15,431 --> 00:59:17,450
Speaker 0: Tim Bradley loved jokes.

1113
00:59:17,851 --> 00:59:18,947
Speaker 0: He loved puns, too.

1114
00:59:19,773 --> 00:59:22,290
Speaker 0: And like he always said, the badder the better.

1115
00:59:22,990 --> 00:59:24,221
Speaker 0: "Why does the chicken cross the

1116
00:59:24,262 --> 00:59:24,746
Speaker 0: bathroom?".

1117
00:59:25,231 --> 00:59:25,769
Speaker 0: "Move it, man.

1118
00:59:25,971 --> 00:59:27,107
Speaker 0: I'll be waiting for you right

1119
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:27,290
Speaker 0: here.".

1120
00:59:28,210 --> 00:59:29,910
Speaker 0: Tim pushed through the swinging door.

1121
00:59:30,390 --> 00:59:33,670
Speaker 0: He went to a sink, ran cold water, and splashed it on his face.

1122
00:59:34,370 --> 00:59:37,010
Speaker 0: Boy oh boy oh boy was he in trouble.

1123
00:59:37,731 --> 00:59:38,304
Speaker 0: What was he gonna do?

1124
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:41,642
Speaker 0: The word around the school was the last kid who crossed.

1125
00:59:41,702 --> 00:59:41,903
Speaker 0: Burt.

1126
00:59:42,044 --> 00:59:45,470
Speaker 0: Alvin was wearing concrete braces at the bottom of Bulmer Pond.

1127
00:59:46,391 --> 00:59:55,190
Speaker 0: Tim was pretty good when it came to wrestling Hulk Hogan or Macho Man on his Nintendo trademark, but when it came to real life, he wasn't the kind of kid to fight much.

1128
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:59,950
Speaker 0: Gosh, he really wasn't a kind of jam, and it wasn't the good grape kind either.

1129
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:04,049
Speaker 0: "Excuse me," said a deep voice from behind him.

1130
01:00:04,291 --> 01:00:05,461
Speaker 0: "Are you Timothy

1131
01:00:05,542 --> 01:00:06,047
Speaker 0: Bradley?".

1132
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:07,249
Speaker 0: Tim jumped.

1133
01:00:07,850 --> 01:00:09,770
Speaker 0: Startled, he looked up into the mirror.

1134
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:19,810
Speaker 0: Standing behind him was a tall, blonde-haired man who looked like a superhero from a comic book, only with short hair and a vulnerable, perplexed look on his face.

1135
01:00:20,510 --> 01:00:23,350
Speaker 0: But boy, his costume sure wasn't from anything this century.

1136
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:30,370
Speaker 0: He wore what looked like a handmade sheep's wool jacket and trousers with a sackcloth shirt cinched at the waist by a wide leather belt.

1137
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:35,870
Speaker 0: His black boots were leather as well, and he smelled distinctly of garlic.

1138
01:00:36,511 --> 01:00:37,428
Speaker 0: "Uh, yeah, that's me.

1139
01:00:37,811 --> 01:00:38,722
Speaker 0: What is this, Halloween

1140
01:00:38,762 --> 01:00:39,066
Speaker 0: already?".

1141
01:00:39,835 --> 01:00:40,824
Speaker 0: "May I introduce

1142
01:00:40,905 --> 01:00:41,410
Speaker 0: myself?".

1143
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:43,910
Speaker 0: Tim noted a distinct accent.

1144
01:00:44,556 --> 01:00:46,050
Speaker 0: "I am Simon Belmont.

1145
01:00:46,430 --> 01:00:50,730
Speaker 0: I have come here to your dimension to seek your help with a dreadfully important quest.

1146
01:00:51,210 --> 01:00:52,430
Speaker 0: The fate of Castlevania.

1147
01:00:52,930 --> 01:00:58,348
Speaker 0: To say nothing of my soul, my life, and the soul and life of the woman I love are at

1148
01:00:58,489 --> 01:00:58,790
Speaker 0: stake.".

1149
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:02,305
Speaker 0: "Oh," said Tim, "and I thought I had

1150
01:01:02,365 --> 01:01:02,889
Speaker 0: problems.".
