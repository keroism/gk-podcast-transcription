1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,584
Speaker 1: It's Thursday, May 6th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,584 --> 00:00:10,066
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:14,825 --> 00:00:15,360
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:16,726
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Knives.

5
00:00:16,767 --> 00:00:19,100
Speaker 1: Tonight we're talking about learning languages.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,217
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:22,900
Speaker 1: Oh shit, do you have an opening bid?

8
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:26,692
Speaker 1: Uh... I guess I did.

9
00:00:27,176 --> 00:00:27,580
Speaker 1: I got one.

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:27,944
Speaker 0: One second.

11
00:00:28,026 --> 00:00:28,838
Speaker 0: Let me remember it.

12
00:00:29,761 --> 00:00:30,540
Speaker 1: I had it.

13
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,651
Speaker 1: Right, you said you had one.

14
00:00:31,772 --> 00:00:32,398
Speaker 1: You said it.

15
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,199
Speaker 1: Why was it?

16
00:00:35,281 --> 00:00:36,840
Speaker 1: If you forgot it, I can start with something.

17
00:00:37,722 --> 00:00:39,559
Speaker 1: I feel like I should leave this in the show this time.

18
00:00:40,240 --> 00:00:40,580
Speaker 1: This fumbling.

19
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,499
Speaker 0: What the fuck was the opening bid?

20
00:00:43,121 --> 00:00:44,880
Speaker 1: Can I talk about my rim light in more detail?

21
00:00:46,331 --> 00:00:46,478
Speaker 1: No.

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,379
Speaker 1: I could set the rim light to make it look like there's just a fireworks show going on behind me.

23
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:51,700
Speaker 1: You got nothing?

24
00:00:52,042 --> 00:00:53,059
Speaker 0: I forget my opening bid.

25
00:00:56,322 --> 00:00:59,780
Speaker 1: That feels very, like, near the end of COVID lockdown feels.

26
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:03,940
Speaker 0: Oh, I thought of a different opening bid.

27
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,760
Speaker 1: Alright, I'm just assuming that's the first one that you originally thought of.

28
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:08,565
Speaker 0: It's not.

29
00:01:08,586 --> 00:01:09,880
Speaker 0: It's definitely a different one.

30
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:10,747
Speaker 1: Alright, go for it.

31
00:01:10,848 --> 00:01:11,558
Speaker 1: I stuck a marker in.

32
00:01:12,542 --> 00:01:12,758
Speaker 0: Alright.

33
00:01:16,927 --> 00:01:17,839
Speaker 1: Did you forget this one too?

34
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:18,801
Speaker 0: No.

35
00:01:18,983 --> 00:01:21,520
Speaker 0: I'm just figuring out how to start it off contextually.

36
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,710
Speaker 0: So way back in the day...

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,405
Speaker 1: Wait, which day?

38
00:01:25,425 --> 00:01:26,251
Speaker 1: There were a lot of days.

39
00:01:26,291 --> 00:01:27,360
Speaker 1: There were the college days.

40
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:33,080
Speaker 0: It's actually a long time ago, but it feels like less of a long time ago, but it's actually quite long ago.

41
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:36,520
Speaker 0: There was a store in Manhattan called Broadway Panhandler.

42
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,440
Speaker 0: It was a store where you would buy kitchen stuff, right?

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,660
Speaker 0: Panhandler, get it, lol?

44
00:01:45,921 --> 00:01:49,820
Speaker 0: And, you know, the chef's knife that I have in my kitchen, I bought at that store.

45
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,788
Speaker 0: That's how long I've had it.

46
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:52,120
Speaker 0: I was living in Beacon at the time.

47
00:01:52,562 --> 00:01:55,400
Speaker 0: I just went down there, like, after work to buy, you know, kitchen stuff.

48
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:57,838
Speaker 0: That store has been closed a long time.

49
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:01,699
Speaker 0: But I would also go there to get my knife sharpened, you know?

50
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:02,578
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you do.

51
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,560
Speaker 0: There were knife experts there, and it cost, like, a few bucks.

52
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:12,339
Speaker 1: It cost a few bucks, and it's not hard to sharpen a knife, but it takes an amount of time, and it costs so little to just get someone else to do it.

53
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:14,508
Speaker 0: Sure.

54
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:22,340
Speaker 0: The last time I needed my knife sharpened... You know, basically, it's one of those things, like, I don't get it done as often as I should, especially in the COVID times, right?

55
00:02:22,521 --> 00:02:30,260
Speaker 0: It was already needed to be sharpened, and then, you know... I brought one to the place that's right near RIM, the Saito Trading Company.

56
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,024
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah!

57
00:02:31,065 --> 00:02:35,540
Speaker 1: We're actually, we're planning to head down there and get a bunch of our knives sharpened, and also, there's a new knife we want.

58
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:42,780
Speaker 0: No, they did okay, you know, but it wasn't like, oh my god, the knife is, like, slicing paper, like, magically, right?

59
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:50,959
Speaker 0: So, I've always wanted to be able to sharpen a knife, you know, with the whetstone, like they do on YouTube, and, you know, they're, like, it becomes ridiculously sharp.

60
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:57,759
Speaker 0: But also, you know, it's like I'm so worried, like, oh, it takes such skill, it's like you're gonna, you know, mess up the knife or whatever.

61
00:02:59,402 --> 00:03:02,060
Speaker 0: But, yeah, I just was, like, you know what, I'll just do it, right?

62
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:13,700
Speaker 0: I'll buy the, I'm watching YouTube videos, I bought the cheapest, well, not the cheapest, but, you know, a relatively inexpensive, highly rated one, you know, little whetstone set.

63
00:03:14,261 --> 00:03:18,419
Speaker 0: I watched a bunch of YouTube videos, the instructions that came with the set even said to watch YouTube videos.

64
00:03:20,025 --> 00:03:20,640
Speaker 1: That's the future!

65
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:31,320
Speaker 0: You know, and, you know, it turned out okay, knives are sharper, you know, but they're not, like, you know, ridiculously sharp like they are in the videos.

66
00:03:31,681 --> 00:03:37,280
Speaker 0: So, I guess I have to practice more, but, you know, I'll try it again in some months from now, right?

67
00:03:38,442 --> 00:03:40,192
Speaker 0: But I guess, do I recommend it?

68
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:41,540
Speaker 0: Eh, maybe.

69
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:49,220
Speaker 1: I mean, it's one of those things, like, when we shifted from using cartridge razors to safety razors, Well, that's a different situation entirely.

70
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:56,620
Speaker 1: Because shaving with those was both easier and it saved me, like, I stopped counting after it had saved me several thousand dollars.

71
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,140
Speaker 0: It's not, it's not only, it saves you a lot of money and it's better.

72
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,280
Speaker 0: This is not saving you that much money.

73
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,880
Speaker 1: And not better unless you get good at it.

74
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,018
Speaker 0: It's only better if you get really good at it.

75
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:19,476
Speaker 1: It's funny because we were literally having the same conversation, but because they're downstairs from us, the barrier to just, like, walking over there with a knife and being like, "Here's a $1.50, please sharpen

76
00:04:19,495 --> 00:04:19,677
Speaker 1: this.".

77
00:04:20,528 --> 00:04:21,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

78
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,419
Speaker 1: Like, I could just walk, I could walk down there in the middle of cooking if I needed to.

79
00:04:26,005 --> 00:04:26,638
Speaker 0: I wouldn't do that.

80
00:04:27,681 --> 00:04:30,439
Speaker 1: If I was desperate, my knife was just a, I don't know, just a steak.

81
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:44,180
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know, I think if you don't care about your knife, like, losing more material, you know, because I, you know, the whetstone sharpening, you're getting it A, sharper, and B, you're losing less knife material.

82
00:04:45,101 --> 00:04:59,400
Speaker 0: But if you just use, like, the electric sharpeners or those other various kinds of sharpening devices that aren't whetstones, like, they'll still make your knife sharp, you'll just lose more material, and they won't be as sharp as, like, the perfect whetstone sharpening.

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,939
Speaker 0: But who, does that matter to you?

84
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:07,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing I definitely always want to be able to do is hone correctly, because that'll at least keep a knife, like, working pretty well.

85
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,220
Speaker 0: If you hone every time you use it.

86
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,840
Speaker 0: But honing is completely unrelated.

87
00:05:11,122 --> 00:05:12,167
Speaker 1: Exactly, but you gotta do both.

88
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:13,998
Speaker 1: You gotta sharpen them occasionally, and you also gotta hone them.

89
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:15,940
Speaker 0: Sometimes you don't need to hone.

90
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,799
Speaker 1: True, like, don't hone a serrated knife.

91
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:27,640
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but usually it's the knives with softer steel need honing because the tip will, you know, bend around, right?

92
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:36,460
Speaker 0: But if a knife is made with really hard steel, and you don't need to hone it because the burr isn't, like, moving, it's so hard, it's not going anywhere.

93
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,660
Speaker 1: This, uh, weirdly gave me a specifically and strong memory.

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,480
Speaker 1: When I was in high school, me and Ken had to make a video about, uh, like, Macbeth.

95
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,314
Speaker 1: And, uh, we're gonna make this video.

96
00:05:48,354 --> 00:05:49,280
Speaker 1: It's part of a class project.

97
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:58,360
Speaker 1: We needed swords to fight with, and we were, you know, we're both nerds who have real swords, and of course we're not gonna use our real swords, because they're, you know, they're "real" swords.

98
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,992
Speaker 1: And also, we'll just die.

99
00:06:00,133 --> 00:06:00,980
Speaker 1: Like, that'll be a problem.

100
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:03,260
Speaker 1: So, we're not gonna choreograph something good.

101
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:11,140
Speaker 1: So, we went to a Home Depot, and we bought two bars of, like, cheap, mild steel, and just put hafts on 'em, and used those.

102
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,566
Speaker 1: Just, like, imagine a sword.

103
00:06:13,606 --> 00:06:16,780
Speaker 1: that was not, it was just a piece of metal that was flat on all sides.

104
00:06:18,489 --> 00:06:18,700
Speaker 0: Okay.

105
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:20,063
Speaker 1: That's the extent of that.

106
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:30,677
Speaker 1: I had that weird, long piece of metal with a hilt on it for some reason for years, and every now and then, I'd find it again, or someone would find it again and be like, "What the fuck is

107
00:06:30,738 --> 00:06:30,918
Speaker 1: this?".

108
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:33,790
Speaker 1: That's the extent of my anecdote.

109
00:06:34,213 --> 00:06:35,220
Speaker 1: So, let's get into the news.

110
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:37,225
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of stuff going on.

111
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:43,185
Speaker 1: Obviously, some things we're gonna save for, like, a Monday or a Tuesday episode of Geek Nights, but I do want to talk about this one.

112
00:06:43,246 --> 00:06:48,440
Speaker 1: There's a situation going on with the COVID vaccines that you might have seen some talk about, but didn't really understand.

113
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:57,400
Speaker 1: Basically, the vaccines were made by private companies, even though that's a problem, so they have patents on these vaccines.

114
00:06:58,243 --> 00:07:02,100
Speaker 1: So, no one else can make these vaccines without licensing that.

115
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:04,720
Speaker 0: Or getting sued.

116
00:07:06,065 --> 00:07:09,380
Speaker 0: Or being in a country where that law can't touch them and just do it anyway.

117
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:14,230
Speaker 1: And a huge percentage of the world does not have ready access to the vaccine.

118
00:07:14,431 --> 00:07:18,080
Speaker 1: Even countries like Germany and Europe don't have, like, full access yet.

119
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:18,682
Speaker 1: The U.S.

120
00:07:18,702 --> 00:07:22,400
Speaker 1: is, for other reasons we've talked about, way ahead on deploying.

121
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:23,883
Speaker 0: They can't make their own.

122
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:31,080
Speaker 0: Private companies in those countries, if they make their own, might get sued for violating the intellectual property rights.

123
00:07:33,122 --> 00:07:34,886
Speaker 0: So, they just have to buy some from us.

124
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:39,013
Speaker 0: The same way that so many countries just buy weapons from us.

125
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,136
Speaker 0: They're not making missiles.

126
00:07:40,176 --> 00:07:42,360
Speaker 0: They buy our missiles and we sell them to them.

127
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:49,400
Speaker 1: So, it was a moderately big deal in that it was good, but I also want to make it clear that it's not nearly good enough.

128
00:07:49,701 --> 00:07:50,944
Speaker 1: But it was good that the U.S.

129
00:07:51,084 --> 00:07:57,139
Speaker 1: actually said, "We supported waiving the intellectual property rights at least until COVID is under

130
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:57,440
Speaker 1: control.".

131
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,320
Speaker 0: Like, little baby steps.

132
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,274
Speaker 0: By whose definition of "under control," right?

133
00:08:01,315 --> 00:08:01,879
Speaker 0: But that's another...

134
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:05,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, but probably this would be a multi-year thing, like the way it was looking.

135
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:07,092
Speaker 0: It would still be good.

136
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:13,600
Speaker 1: The stock on the vaccine companies plummeted on that news.

137
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:16,912
Speaker 0: Well, okay, so it depends, right?

138
00:08:17,253 --> 00:08:18,738
Speaker 0: A, yes, it did go down, right?

139
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:22,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was going to talk about how then it went back up.

140
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:25,623
Speaker 0: Well, it's not even that it went back up.

141
00:08:25,743 --> 00:08:27,205
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, it went down.

142
00:08:27,305 --> 00:08:36,480
Speaker 0: But if you zoom out on the graph to Pfizer over past five years, ten years, the amount it went down was basically insignificant.

143
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:45,060
Speaker 0: It did cause it to go down, but the amount it went down, not really making the Pfizer shareholders worry.

144
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,131
Speaker 1: But there were drops of like 12-13% for some of these companies.

145
00:08:51,900 --> 00:09:02,920
Speaker 1: So, those stocks rebounded significantly after what happened now, where Germany has come out saying they do not support waiving these intellectual property rights.

146
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,559
Speaker 0: I guess Germany just hates themselves?

147
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:14,420
Speaker 1: Angela Merkel weighed in saying basically that it would create "severe complications" for the production of vaccines, which, that's ridiculous.

148
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:19,720
Speaker 1: The complication causing us to not have vaccines is that these companies are private in the first place.

149
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,406
Speaker 1: Capitalism should have nothing to do with basic medical technology.

150
00:09:24,446 --> 00:09:32,020
Speaker 1: The fact that governments aren't funding this solely for the benefit of humanity is egregious and is arguably just straight up violence.

151
00:09:32,802 --> 00:09:39,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I've been saying the same thing for a while since I learned it from someone else, which is that, like, do you believe in democracy?

152
00:09:40,020 --> 00:09:42,586
Speaker 0: If you don't, well then, don't worry about this conversation, right?

153
00:09:42,606 --> 00:09:48,260
Speaker 0: But if you believe in democracy that people collectively should decide how our society operates, right?

154
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:55,300
Speaker 0: Then whatever mechanism you have for your democracy, A, should be actually democratic, not like what most countries have.

155
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:56,119
Speaker 0: Ours especially.

156
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:57,899
Speaker 1: Ours especially right now.

157
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,583
Speaker 0: Yes, especially.

158
00:10:00,084 --> 00:10:09,080
Speaker 0: But B, that that democratically elected institution, whatever form it takes, must be the most powerful organization there is.

159
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:22,900
Speaker 0: There's no other organization of any form or shape or size in the society must be able to challenge the power of the democratically elected organization because otherwise you don't have democracy anymore, right?

160
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:32,880
Speaker 0: It's like we elected this government, even if you had the best elections that were so fairly and properly conducted, you elect this government that accurately represents the will of the people.

161
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:52,660
Speaker 0: If there's some private company that, like, not even necessarily is in total more powerful than the whole government, but has any sort of leverage against the government whatsoever, then that means that the will of the people is at least partially overrun or at odds with some other non-democratic power.

162
00:10:52,905 --> 00:10:53,378
Speaker 1: Case in point.

163
00:10:54,322 --> 00:10:56,080
Speaker 0: That means you don't have democracy.

164
00:10:56,400 --> 00:11:13,620
Speaker 0: So therefore, any organization, including, say, a farmer's school company in this case, that has enough power to sort of, you know, change or move the government and, you know, compete with the will of the people cannot be allowed to exist if you believe in democracy.

165
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:22,060
Speaker 1: There is an incident that happened in the United States where literally a rich dude bailed out the US federal government.

166
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,019
Speaker 0: Like, that happened once.

167
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,527
Speaker 0: That also includes an individual person.

168
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:32,300
Speaker 0: If an individual person is so powerful that they can, you know, affect the government.

169
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,603
Speaker 1: Well, it's like in Blades in the Dark.

170
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:34,345
Speaker 1: There are factions.

171
00:11:34,386 --> 00:11:39,460
Speaker 1: Like, there's a faction, like the Bluecoats or the Grinders that all have their different deals and they have different tiers.

172
00:11:39,901 --> 00:11:42,439
Speaker 1: There's one faction that's just one fucking dude.

173
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:43,721
Speaker 0: Yeah.

174
00:11:44,082 --> 00:11:48,872
Speaker 0: And there's also things like it doesn't even have to be private organizations, right?

175
00:11:48,913 --> 00:11:51,117
Speaker 0: The NYPD is strong enough.

176
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:52,340
Speaker 0: It's a public organization.

177
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:52,798
Speaker 0: Yeah.

178
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,625
Speaker 0: But it is strong enough to basically oppose.

179
00:11:55,825 --> 00:11:57,729
Speaker 0: It's not democratically elected directly.

180
00:11:57,929 --> 00:12:04,000
Speaker 0: You know, they're like employees, yet they're powerful enough to influence the mayor more than the voters are.

181
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:10,680
Speaker 1: Can you imagine how radically different in a positive way New York City would be if we elected the cops?

182
00:12:11,843 --> 00:12:11,937
Speaker 0: Sure.

183
00:12:12,161 --> 00:12:13,305
Speaker 1: And took away their guns, of course.

184
00:12:13,365 --> 00:12:17,458
Speaker 1: But if they were elected by the people of their boroughs.

185
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:18,540
Speaker 0: Yes.

186
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:27,800
Speaker 0: If you believe in democracy, there cannot be any organization of any kind that is more powerful in any way than the democratically elected organization.

187
00:12:29,202 --> 00:12:29,458
Speaker 0: The end.

188
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:40,657
Speaker 1: So in some other news, YouTube's TikTok clone shorts, it's actually been around for a while, but it wasn't really available in the US, is out.

189
00:12:40,818 --> 00:12:41,298
Speaker 1: You can do it.

190
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,260
Speaker 1: Scott made one already.

191
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:43,320
Speaker 0: Yeah.

192
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,563
Speaker 0: So there was YouTube short.

193
00:12:44,603 --> 00:12:45,965
Speaker 0: Basically, you know, it's like TikTok.

194
00:12:46,005 --> 00:12:47,328
Speaker 0: I'm actually kind of like.

195
00:12:47,508 --> 00:12:49,772
Speaker 0: the thing with TikTok is the app itself.

196
00:12:49,912 --> 00:12:54,020
Speaker 0: I'm not liking the user interface or anything and I don't like the owners of it.

197
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,800
Speaker 1: I don't like the sense, the nature of the censorship on that platform.

198
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:58,903
Speaker 0: Exactly.

199
00:12:59,807 --> 00:13:02,180
Speaker 0: However, and I won't install it on any of my devices.

200
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,219
Speaker 1: Oh, I would not install TikTok on my phone.

201
00:13:04,682 --> 00:13:05,849
Speaker 0: But I will visit the website.

202
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,600
Speaker 0: The website is, you know, I can just visit the website.

203
00:13:08,282 --> 00:13:12,100
Speaker 1: Usually I watch TikToks that people have exported and put up on YouTube, to be honest.

204
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,547
Speaker 0: That is also the most of what I do as well.

205
00:13:14,587 --> 00:13:17,740
Speaker 0: But I have visited the website a couple of times or seen embeds and such.

206
00:13:18,701 --> 00:13:26,120
Speaker 0: But I do greatly enjoy the content on TikTok, the community of people who are making content there and the things they are making.

207
00:13:26,201 --> 00:13:28,320
Speaker 0: There's really good stuff going on there.

208
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,226
Speaker 1: Well, just like Vine.

209
00:13:29,367 --> 00:13:30,374
Speaker 1: Vine was like...

210
00:13:32,524 --> 00:13:34,392
Speaker 0: TikTok is like Vine plus plus.

211
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,000
Speaker 0: It's like another level.

212
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:40,107
Speaker 1: Vine was such a creative explosion and a sea change.

213
00:13:40,407 --> 00:13:47,280
Speaker 1: And also Vine was a place where black creators in particular really exploded and like made a movement of art.

214
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:48,904
Speaker 0: Sure.

215
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:55,420
Speaker 0: One of my favorite TikTok things I've seen actually is there's a guy who is a actual dermatologist.

216
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,151
Speaker 0: And he does, he has a TikTok where he basically does all kinds of different things.

217
00:14:00,191 --> 00:14:03,300
Speaker 0: Like he'll watch people, you know, do skincare stuff.

218
00:14:03,621 --> 00:14:04,547
Speaker 0: And he'll be like, "Right.

219
00:14:04,668 --> 00:14:05,030
Speaker 0: Wrong.

220
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,573
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

221
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:05,634
Speaker 1: Do

222
00:14:05,694 --> 00:14:06,177
Speaker 1: this.".

223
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:16,740
Speaker 0: And then he also will like, he'll do reactions to like people popping giant zits or scraping gross stuff off their face, which is always weird.

224
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,108
Speaker 0: I know we have some friends that enjoy that stuff a lot.

225
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:21,858
Speaker 0: For me, I sort of mix enjoy it.

226
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:22,399
Speaker 0: A part of me...

227
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:23,403
Speaker 1: I got the same feeling.

228
00:14:23,604 --> 00:14:28,340
Speaker 1: It's like on one hand, I'm fascinated and I like to see strange, even terrifying things.

229
00:14:28,661 --> 00:14:32,840
Speaker 1: But on the other hand, enjoy is not a word I would use to describe that feeling.

230
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:33,521
Speaker 0: Exactly.

231
00:14:33,802 --> 00:14:34,827
Speaker 0: It's like eating a food.

232
00:14:34,868 --> 00:14:35,873
Speaker 0: It's like sweet and sour.

233
00:14:35,893 --> 00:14:37,340
Speaker 0: Well, I guess sweet and sour just tastes good.

234
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,440
Speaker 1: Well, you know, it's like when I got my vaccine, I had the side effects for a day.

235
00:14:40,540 --> 00:14:46,295
Speaker 1: Like I wouldn't say I enjoyed it, but I appreciated how unique that experience was.

236
00:14:46,455 --> 00:14:48,380
Speaker 0: Appreciate, but do not necessarily enjoy.

237
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:57,019
Speaker 0: I'm simultaneously feeling satisfaction, like the same satisfaction you get when you watch a power washing video while also feeling like gross.

238
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:00,170
Speaker 0: Like I just saw some gross.

239
00:15:00,712 --> 00:15:02,640
Speaker 0: And it's like they mix that together at the same time.

240
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:07,980
Speaker 1: But part of it is I've definitely I've seen enough terrifying, gross, frightening things.

241
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,745
Speaker 0: You don't need to watch any well in real life to where.

242
00:15:11,146 --> 00:15:18,260
Speaker 1: if it's not present in the room with me, it's very hard to push me over the line anyway.

243
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,987
Speaker 0: But yeah, I enjoy TikTok content.

244
00:15:20,007 --> 00:15:22,998
Speaker 0: So I was excited at the prospect of YouTube shorts because I'm OK.

245
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:26,392
Speaker 0: I'm more OK with YouTube than TikTok as a thing.

246
00:15:26,533 --> 00:15:28,160
Speaker 1: That more there is a load bearing word.

247
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,122
Speaker 1: I'm glad you stuck that in.

248
00:15:29,423 --> 00:15:30,787
Speaker 0: It's a very low bearing more.

249
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:35,900
Speaker 0: And so YouTube shorts is basically just TikTok, except it makes a YouTube video when you're done.

250
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:38,233
Speaker 0: It's been out in India for a while.

251
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:39,360
Speaker 0: It's I think it's big there.

252
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,726
Speaker 1: Well, it's big there because TikTok is banned there.

253
00:15:42,468 --> 00:15:43,109
Speaker 0: Oh, interesting.

254
00:15:44,052 --> 00:15:47,260
Speaker 0: And then they were they brought it in like in beta to the US a little bit.

255
00:15:47,641 --> 00:15:48,143
Speaker 0: But now it's.

256
00:15:48,323 --> 00:15:49,206
Speaker 0: now it's everyone.

257
00:15:49,528 --> 00:15:50,210
Speaker 0: It's still beta.

258
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:53,120
Speaker 0: But for everyone, I think you can now just make YouTube shorts.

259
00:15:53,280 --> 00:16:00,480
Speaker 0: So in terms of watching, I still think TikTok has the ones to watch, but I'm not going to make TikTok because I'm not going to install the app.

260
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,349
Speaker 0: So I made a YouTube short.

261
00:16:02,389 --> 00:16:04,158
Speaker 0: Let's see if I can come up with any more.

262
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:04,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

263
00:16:04,741 --> 00:16:09,539
Speaker 1: Young Rim, like I said in the forum, would have said on this show, I'm going to make one a week no matter how bad it is.

264
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:14,440
Speaker 1: Aged Wiser Rim is just going to say you might see me make a TikTok short at some point.

265
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,555
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I got to think of something that fits in 15 seconds.

266
00:16:17,595 --> 00:16:18,299
Speaker 0: It's like it's not easy.

267
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,860
Speaker 1: Oh, so I actually went back because I knew TikTok was banned in India, but I didn't know the full story.

268
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,788
Speaker 1: It's because of that border clash between India and China.

269
00:16:27,149 --> 00:16:31,840
Speaker 1: India banned a whole swath of basically any apps that were owned by certain Chinese companies.

270
00:16:32,747 --> 00:16:33,009
Speaker 0: OK.

271
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,359
Speaker 1: That's what's going on there.

272
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:42,300
Speaker 0: And Google stepped in and beat Facebook to the race there to grab the dropped baton or whatever.

273
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:52,840
Speaker 1: I feel like if you're going to make YouTube shorts, like if the short videos are going to explode in a big way, like beyond what's happened with TikTok, focus on a niche that is underserved.

274
00:16:53,421 --> 00:16:56,320
Speaker 1: I want to see indie RPG shorts.

275
00:16:57,481 --> 00:16:59,066
Speaker 0: I do think that that is the.

276
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:03,480
Speaker 0: if you look at the people on TikTok who are successful is they find a niche and stick to it.

277
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,400
Speaker 0: And that's how they're able to make so much content is doing the same thing over and over.

278
00:17:07,862 --> 00:17:11,540
Speaker 0: If you try to do variety, it's like like us, you run out of ideas.

279
00:17:11,961 --> 00:17:16,319
Speaker 0: You need one idea that's popular and just keep doing it like the less sausage YouTube channel.

280
00:17:16,923 --> 00:17:17,025
Speaker 0: Yeah.

281
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:18,339
Speaker 0: Hydraulic press YouTube channel.

282
00:17:18,619 --> 00:17:18,923
Speaker 0: What can I?

283
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:20,579
Speaker 1: what can what do I do so frequently?

284
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:21,988
Speaker 0: Lawyer doesn't need new ideas.

285
00:17:22,029 --> 00:17:22,954
Speaker 0: He just needs new locks.

286
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:23,519
Speaker 0: Right.

287
00:17:24,521 --> 00:17:24,762
Speaker 1: Yeah.

288
00:17:25,405 --> 00:17:29,140
Speaker 1: I guess the best I could do is I could try to do something with my me failing at Overwatch.

289
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,209
Speaker 1: I'll figure something out.

290
00:17:30,513 --> 00:17:31,040
Speaker 1: I'll make something.

291
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:32,222
Speaker 0: Exactly.

292
00:17:32,363 --> 00:17:38,500
Speaker 1: Anyway, in some other news, Twitter actually has done a couple of things recently.

293
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:42,233
Speaker 1: They added a tip jar, which is there's.

294
00:17:42,334 --> 00:17:43,700
Speaker 1: there's some stuff going on with that.

295
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:44,386
Speaker 1: We'll see how it plays.

296
00:17:44,426 --> 00:17:45,820
Speaker 0: I mean, adding a tip jar on Twitter.

297
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:52,480
Speaker 0: It's like people are talking about it, but it's like you can already just put your coffee link, you know, coffee link or your your Patreon link in your profile.

298
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,764
Speaker 0: It's like what's what's now.

299
00:17:53,825 --> 00:17:58,340
Speaker 0: it's like some people can get this tip jar like officially lit up in the Twitter interface.

300
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,223
Speaker 0: It's not very different.

301
00:17:59,383 --> 00:18:04,060
Speaker 1: Pretty sure they're doing it this way because it's a trial balloon for even more features related to this down the road.

302
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,520
Speaker 0: Some people like their cash app IDs up there.

303
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:14,840
Speaker 1: Remember, Twitter was talking about having the option to have some of your tweets or an alternate channel that are subscriber only that cost them money.

304
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:16,480
Speaker 1: Like you have to pay to subscribe.

305
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:17,444
Speaker 0: That'd be OK.

306
00:18:17,464 --> 00:18:18,860
Speaker 0: You know, you have a Patreon integration.

307
00:18:18,981 --> 00:18:20,857
Speaker 1: I'd be 100 percent OK with that, because Twitter's biggest problem.

308
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:23,499
Speaker 0: You're going to see more tweets from me than other people see.

309
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:28,520
Speaker 1: Because Twitter's biggest problem is that it doesn't charge the users or the creators.

310
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,520
Speaker 1: It makes money with ads and bullshit.

311
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,300
Speaker 1: Come up with a better monetization model.

312
00:18:32,581 --> 00:18:36,780
Speaker 1: I'm always in favor of models that involve having the people pay for the thing they use.

313
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:38,858
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am.

314
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:45,400
Speaker 0: But I read a thing today written by a guy who works for Google on ads and he's like, why I'm OK working on ads.

315
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:47,418
Speaker 0: And obviously I disagreed with most of it.

316
00:18:47,941 --> 00:18:56,400
Speaker 0: But the one thing he said is like, look, you know, if you don't have ads, then a lot of this content is like has no way to pay for it.

317
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,258
Speaker 0: And it won't exist.

318
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:03,780
Speaker 0: And would you rather have, you know, look at how much of a problem it is that, you know, the real news is behind a paywall and no one sees it.

319
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,339
Speaker 0: And the fake news is just out there.

320
00:19:06,343 --> 00:19:09,395
Speaker 1: But the problem there is not ads and no ads.

321
00:19:09,435 --> 00:19:10,520
Speaker 1: The problem there is capitalism.

322
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,360
Speaker 1: You can't make money doing anything.

323
00:19:13,201 --> 00:19:13,342
Speaker 0: Right.

324
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:17,220
Speaker 0: If you didn't have the ads, the fake news wouldn't be there at all, which is, I think, good.

325
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:18,999
Speaker 0: But also no one would get the real news.

326
00:19:19,461 --> 00:19:19,712
Speaker 1: Right.

327
00:19:22,122 --> 00:19:25,933
Speaker 1: But also the ads to a degree are just shifting who you're stealing the money from?

328
00:19:26,013 --> 00:19:28,420
Speaker 1: because the advertisers are in many cases getting ripped off.

329
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,427
Speaker 1: Anyway, we've talked about that a lot.

330
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:33,620
Speaker 1: So this isn't like earth shattering news.

331
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:36,288
Speaker 1: Twitter did something else that I always.

332
00:19:36,308 --> 00:19:39,720
Speaker 1: it amazed me why people were so mad about this for so long.

333
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:43,699
Speaker 1: Maybe just because I follow a lot of artists who were like oddly persnickety about it.

334
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:47,080
Speaker 1: Twitter had a cropping algorithm that would just crop images.

335
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,799
Speaker 1: If you post an image, it'll crop it.

336
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,180
Speaker 1: So it fits on your phone app, whatever you're looking at Twitter where you couldn't control the crop.

337
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:53,561
Speaker 1: Yeah.

338
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:55,540
Speaker 1: But if you click out an image, you see the whole image anyway.

339
00:19:56,548 --> 00:19:56,739
Speaker 0: Sure.

340
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,040
Speaker 1: If I see an image on Twitter, I'm going to click.

341
00:19:59,521 --> 00:20:00,780
Speaker 0: The crop was sometimes unfortunate.

342
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:05,040
Speaker 1: Well, so the problem with the crop algorithm was that it tried to be too clever.

343
00:20:05,561 --> 00:20:08,780
Speaker 1: It ended up doing some like very obviously racist things.

344
00:20:09,447 --> 00:20:10,520
Speaker 0: It also did that, yes.

345
00:20:10,921 --> 00:20:12,139
Speaker 1: And it did some unfortunate things.

346
00:20:13,361 --> 00:20:16,880
Speaker 1: They probably could have gotten away with just having it always crop the top half of the image and just let people deal.

347
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:17,979
Speaker 1: That would probably work better.

348
00:20:19,001 --> 00:20:19,315
Speaker 0: I don't know.

349
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,679
Speaker 1: But apparently they got rid of it.

350
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:26,960
Speaker 1: But also I'm seeing a lot of people freaking out that they still see the cropping.

351
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,799
Speaker 1: And I think a lot of people...

352
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,840
Speaker 0: They only got rid of it on the mobile app.

353
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:39,920
Speaker 0: If you're using desktop app or tweet deck or something else, you're not going to see, you're going to still get in whatever cropping you've got based on whatever app you're using.

354
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,440
Speaker 0: Because, you know, I'm pretty sure the cropping is happening locally.

355
00:20:43,001 --> 00:20:47,359
Speaker 0: And this is a great time to say if Twitter is, you know, an OK place to be.

356
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,046
Speaker 0: I'm on Twitter.

357
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:48,838
Speaker 0: I use Twitter a lot.

358
00:20:49,342 --> 00:20:51,840
Speaker 0: Do not use the default Twitter website.

359
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,939
Speaker 0: Do not use the default Twitter app.

360
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:55,279
Speaker 0: Just uninstall that shit.

361
00:20:55,441 --> 00:20:57,760
Speaker 0: Go and get some third party Twitter app.

362
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:02,800
Speaker 0: I mean, tweet deck is owned by Twitter, but it might as well be a third party app, at least still for now.

363
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:03,387
Speaker 0: Who knows?

364
00:21:03,407 --> 00:21:03,959
Speaker 0: It might change.

365
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:06,940
Speaker 0: You know, on your iPhone, you can get Tweetbot.

366
00:21:07,983 --> 00:21:09,900
Speaker 0: It's a very, very cheap subscription.

367
00:21:10,504 --> 00:21:11,940
Speaker 0: It's like you're using Twitter that much.

368
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,591
Speaker 0: It's like this is cheaper than anything.

369
00:21:13,753 --> 00:21:14,660
Speaker 0: It's so inexpensive.

370
00:21:15,201 --> 00:21:24,200
Speaker 0: And if you get it, you will see only tweets from people you follow in reverse chronological order and no ads and no bullshit.

371
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,800
Speaker 0: And you can block and mute people.

372
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,113
Speaker 1: Well, you're going to see bullshit.

373
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:27,640
Speaker 1: It is Twitter.

374
00:21:28,141 --> 00:21:29,159
Speaker 1: I mean, sure, sure.

375
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:33,820
Speaker 0: But the point is, do not use the official Twitter apps ever.

376
00:21:33,961 --> 00:21:36,540
Speaker 0: The website, the real app, do not use them.

377
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,180
Speaker 0: They're garbage.

378
00:21:38,162 --> 00:21:42,300
Speaker 0: All the bad things you hate about Twitter, a lot of it is because you're using those apps.

379
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,156
Speaker 0: Do not use them.

380
00:21:44,443 --> 00:21:45,059
Speaker 0: Use the third party.

381
00:21:45,821 --> 00:21:51,600
Speaker 1: In a minor news, I don't put a lot of stock in these things because they're a lot like the Academy Awards.

382
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:53,600
Speaker 1: The Michelin stars are arbitrary.

383
00:21:54,101 --> 00:21:56,640
Speaker 1: They definitely have a European centric focus.

384
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,877
Speaker 1: There's a lot of problems with them.

385
00:21:58,622 --> 00:22:04,360
Speaker 0: If you don't know, my feeling on them was if a place has them, it's probably really tasty frickin food, probably.

386
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:07,219
Speaker 1: But a place not having it does not mean it's not great food.

387
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:08,753
Speaker 0: Not at all.

388
00:22:08,876 --> 00:22:09,080
Speaker 0: Right.

389
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,180
Speaker 0: It's like but, you know, I'm not good.

390
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:11,741
Speaker 0: I'd ever.

391
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:19,720
Speaker 0: it was mostly a thing to like, you know, it ended up because it started as like, you know, literally a travel guide.

392
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,280
Speaker 0: Like you're traveling somewhere.

393
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:25,760
Speaker 0: There's no Google Maps, you know, will help you figure out which restaurants to go to.

394
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:31,220
Speaker 1: Remember traveling when there is no way to know the deal of any restaurant in advance.

395
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:32,381
Speaker 0: Right.

396
00:22:32,401 --> 00:22:35,500
Speaker 0: You know, like those placemats at the diner would tell you about all the places in town.

397
00:22:36,223 --> 00:22:36,365
Speaker 1: Yeah.

398
00:22:36,406 --> 00:22:37,179
Speaker 1: Hole to nowhere.

399
00:22:38,321 --> 00:22:38,897
Speaker 1: Yellow pages.

400
00:22:40,401 --> 00:22:41,174
Speaker 0: AAA would help you.

401
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:41,439
Speaker 0: Right.

402
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,299
Speaker 0: Travel agents, you know, they tell you what was going on in places.

403
00:22:45,525 --> 00:22:46,540
Speaker 0: And that's why it existed.

404
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:52,780
Speaker 0: But it ended up becoming this thing where, you know, no one's using it as a travel guide anymore.

405
00:22:52,901 --> 00:22:53,062
Speaker 0: Right.

406
00:22:53,082 --> 00:22:55,418
Speaker 0: Instead, it became a target for restaurants to hit.

407
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,739
Speaker 0: You know, the what's the what's the principle called?

408
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:03,040
Speaker 0: Which I can think of a measure ceases to become a measure.

409
00:23:03,141 --> 00:23:04,454
Speaker 0: It becomes a right.

410
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:04,979
Speaker 1: Yeah.

411
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:05,301
Speaker 1: Yeah.

412
00:23:05,322 --> 00:23:05,483
Speaker 1: I don't.

413
00:23:05,725 --> 00:23:07,620
Speaker 1: I find whatever that is on the tip of my tongue.

414
00:23:08,341 --> 00:23:08,685
Speaker 0: Yeah.

415
00:23:08,989 --> 00:23:09,860
Speaker 1: But also that.

416
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:10,561
Speaker 1: Yeah.

417
00:23:10,581 --> 00:23:17,900
Speaker 1: So a restaurant will try to cater itself to the taste of the people who judge this to try to get on the list instead of necessarily catering to.

418
00:23:18,842 --> 00:23:22,300
Speaker 1: I'm not saying what would be good, but what could be good, but does not cater to them.

419
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:23,872
Speaker 1: The same thing happened with wine.

420
00:23:23,953 --> 00:23:24,800
Speaker 1: Wine over time.

421
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:34,740
Speaker 1: High end wine has catered to the kinds of people who are rich enough to afford high end wine and write about high end wine, thus causing a feedback loop that caused high end wine to get more like that.

422
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,520
Speaker 0: Superhero comics catered to the nerds who bought ten variant covers.

423
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:45,880
Speaker 1: But there's a paragraph in this article that points out one of the biggest reasons why I'm not a big fan of the Michelin stars.

424
00:23:46,200 --> 00:24:01,619
Speaker 1: Quote, "With the exception of Jeju Noodle Bar, no ramen or ramyun spot has earned a star in the city, nor is any barbecue spot, pizzeria, food truck, taco stand, modern Vietnamese fare, or scores of other culinary styles New York is famous

425
00:24:01,659 --> 00:24:01,800
Speaker 1: for.".

426
00:24:02,342 --> 00:24:04,078
Speaker 0: Note, zero taco places.

427
00:24:04,179 --> 00:24:04,239
Speaker 0: No.

428
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:04,881
Speaker 0: Well, well, well.

429
00:24:05,603 --> 00:24:12,740
Speaker 1: With the exception of Casa Enrique, the city's starred Mexican restaurants are chic and expensive.

430
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:13,983
Speaker 1: This is why I'm bringing this up.

431
00:24:14,584 --> 00:24:21,420
Speaker 1: Years and years and years ago when we lived here, a little tiny Mexican place opened up that was a spinoff of a French place, like same kitchen.

432
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:21,941
Speaker 1: They were cool.

433
00:24:21,981 --> 00:24:27,020
Speaker 1: people called Casa Enrique, and it was just really good Mexican food, like really good Mexican food.

434
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:28,602
Speaker 1: And it was cheap.

435
00:24:29,965 --> 00:24:39,040
Speaker 1: Like not cheap by like a real scale, but for New York scale, like for as good as this food was, it cost as much as like a normal restaurant in a normal non New York city place.

436
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,840
Speaker 0: Normal night out prices.

437
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:41,282
Speaker 0: Yeah.

438
00:24:41,744 --> 00:24:45,020
Speaker 1: So it got a Michelin star years ago.

439
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,859
Speaker 0: Just one, not, not all three.

440
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:47,201
Speaker 1: Yup.

441
00:24:47,523 --> 00:24:50,520
Speaker 0: And there's also the half star, the bib gourmand half star.

442
00:24:51,542 --> 00:24:51,723
Speaker 1: Yup.

443
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,336
Speaker 1: But Casa Enrique has maintained, they got the Michelin star again.

444
00:24:55,377 --> 00:24:56,099
Speaker 1: They keep getting it.

445
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:59,393
Speaker 1: But the cool thing is they never raise their prices or change their menu.

446
00:24:59,795 --> 00:25:00,920
Speaker 1: They just keep doing what they're doing.

447
00:25:01,381 --> 00:25:05,959
Speaker 1: The only thing that changed is I haven't eaten there since, because I can't get in.

448
00:25:06,561 --> 00:25:08,927
Speaker 1: There is like a multi-hour wait.

449
00:25:09,168 --> 00:25:10,471
Speaker 1: They won't take reservations.

450
00:25:11,193 --> 00:25:13,960
Speaker 1: A few weeks ago, they started doing delivery.

451
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:15,314
Speaker 0: Oh baby.

452
00:25:15,640 --> 00:25:22,940
Speaker 1: I ordered some tacos, and not only did they do delivery, they deliver so fast, like 25 minutes your tacos arrive.

453
00:25:23,581 --> 00:25:26,640
Speaker 1: And they're the same Michelin star Casa Enrique tacos.

454
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:30,570
Speaker 0: Now Casa Enrique is, I'd say, it's fantastic.

455
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,517
Speaker 0: I love to eat their delicious food, right?

456
00:25:32,597 --> 00:25:33,580
Speaker 0: Great, great restaurant.

457
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:38,740
Speaker 1: It's not my favorite Mexican food, but it's one of my favorite Mexican restaurants.

458
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:39,720
Speaker 0: Exactly.

459
00:25:39,881 --> 00:25:42,530
Speaker 0: I would, like I'm not even joking, right?

460
00:25:42,731 --> 00:25:45,580
Speaker 0: Obviously the Cafe Maya in Fishkill, New York.

461
00:25:46,886 --> 00:25:48,097
Speaker 1: Yucatan Mexican food.

462
00:25:48,197 --> 00:25:48,419
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

463
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,644
Speaker 0: I would rather eat that.

464
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:51,008
Speaker 0: It's that dessert.

465
00:25:51,229 --> 00:25:54,840
Speaker 0: If Casa Enrique is one star, then Cafe Maya is two star.

466
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,240
Speaker 0: And also in Manhattan, there's Tacos Numero Uno.

467
00:25:59,500 --> 00:25:59,935
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

468
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,824
Speaker 0: Tacos Numero Uno?

469
00:26:01,844 --> 00:26:03,971
Speaker 0: I don't want to say, it's not a full restaurant.

470
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,660
Speaker 0: It's more of like a walk-in, grab-and-go kind of place.

471
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:10,280
Speaker 0: It's almost like a truck that's inside, but it's a little more than that, right?

472
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:15,000
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, but it's just like a takeout, quick-eaty place.

473
00:26:16,022 --> 00:26:24,300
Speaker 0: But the taco there specifically, right, is better than like the taco basically anywhere.

474
00:26:24,922 --> 00:26:31,060
Speaker 0: It's like, I don't know, I don't think you could make a taco better than the taco at Tacos Numero Uno.

475
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:37,151
Speaker 0: And I've heard Mexican people agree, right?

476
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:40,480
Speaker 0: And that has no Michelin stars that I'm aware of.

477
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:42,391
Speaker 0: It doesn't even have half stars, as far as I know.

478
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:43,659
Speaker 0: So there you go.

479
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,720
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

480
00:26:53,340 --> 00:27:03,299
Speaker 1: So this is a Twitter thread, but it points out something that we've talked about before on Geek Nights, but this shows that this problem is more widespread and more current than you might think.

481
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:10,460
Speaker 1: Colorization APIs and colorization libraries, especially leveraging machine learning, are getting more and more popular lately.

482
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:20,660
Speaker 1: Ostensibly, they can take an old photo that's either black and white, or use one of those pre-full color processes where there's some color information that you can use.

483
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:25,019
Speaker 0: Well, because you can always remove the color information, make it black and white again, and then colorize it.

484
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:25,532
Speaker 0: Exactly.

485
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,482
Speaker 0: If necessary.

486
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:38,196
Speaker 0: But you can always just also use the existing weak, crappy, low-quality color information to help you make guesses about and move colors into a larger gamut.

487
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:46,185
Speaker 1: Coupled with having knowledge of the time and place the photo was taken, and maybe having other sources of data, there's a lot of ways to approach this problem.

488
00:27:46,727 --> 00:28:00,479
Speaker 1: But it's important because, and we have a lot of studies to show this, black and white photos tend to make people feel like the past was further away and more alien and different than it really was and is.

489
00:28:01,489 --> 00:28:01,735
Speaker 1: That's true.

490
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:02,802
Speaker 1: They're alienating.

491
00:28:02,962 --> 00:28:16,780
Speaker 1: I remember when I was a kid, I saw a photo from World War II in color instead of in black and white, and it blew my kid mind because it just looked like a normal place with normal people doing, well, sadly, normal things.

492
00:28:18,182 --> 00:28:22,540
Speaker 1: And it really made it real how, as many as things change, a lot of things don't change.

493
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:31,080
Speaker 1: But this also gets into the problem where a lot of Europeans, a lot of white supremacists have false ideas about the past.

494
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:35,169
Speaker 1: Like, they think that Roman buildings were white marble and austere.

495
00:28:35,189 --> 00:28:39,640
Speaker 1: Like, no, they were painted with the most garish colors humans have ever conceived.

496
00:28:41,002 --> 00:28:42,800
Speaker 0: And the paint wore out because it was shitty.

497
00:28:43,041 --> 00:28:43,322
Speaker 0: Yeah.

498
00:28:43,864 --> 00:28:48,820
Speaker 1: So the problem now is that these colorization libraries are getting very popular.

499
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:58,522
Speaker 1: So this person, this thing of the day, is they took some photos from 1909 and 1915.

500
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:03,660
Speaker 1: And they were color photos, accurate, good color photos, early color photos.

501
00:29:04,301 --> 00:29:05,223
Speaker 1: They removed the color.

502
00:29:05,925 --> 00:29:18,520
Speaker 1: Then they ran these through some of the most popular colorization libraries and machine learning networks that are out there, ones that a lot of historians use, where these photos get circulated widely using these APIs.

503
00:29:19,261 --> 00:29:21,229
Speaker 1: And you showed the colors, like, what they look like.

504
00:29:21,771 --> 00:29:24,120
Speaker 1: And they look like the old-timey color photos you expect.

505
00:29:25,002 --> 00:29:32,677
Speaker 1: But then you look at the actual real photos and they look literally nothing like what that API did.

506
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,280
Speaker 1: Like, not even close.

507
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:41,400
Speaker 1: The real photos are so vibrant and the colors are so stark and the people look so different.

508
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:43,122
Speaker 0: Yeah.

509
00:29:43,202 --> 00:29:49,960
Speaker 0: And a lot, you know, that's the thing is, you know, as much as people have digital cameras these days, right?

510
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:55,075
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, and we talk about things like vinyl records being poopy, which is true.

511
00:29:55,376 --> 00:29:56,439
Speaker 0: They're just garbage.

512
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:59,299
Speaker 1: They have way more noise than even, like, a CD.

513
00:30:00,482 --> 00:30:00,743
Speaker 0: Right.

514
00:30:00,964 --> 00:30:04,460
Speaker 0: Analog film, you know, depending on a lot of circumstances.

515
00:30:05,741 --> 00:30:11,700
Speaker 0: But the quality of analog film is actually still, to this day, ridiculous resolution.

516
00:30:13,464 --> 00:30:16,149
Speaker 0: You know, it's like not until, like, 4K even.

517
00:30:16,691 --> 00:30:27,340
Speaker 0: It's like, even 1080p, it's like you're better off watching a, you know, 35mm film, as long as it's in good shape and your projector is good, than watching, you know, a 1080p, you know, boot ray.

518
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,180
Speaker 1: But, like, you look at the black and white...

519
00:30:29,361 --> 00:30:32,856
Speaker 0: And even a 70mm film, it's like, get out, right?

520
00:30:32,937 --> 00:30:33,238
Speaker 0: It's like...

521
00:30:34,001 --> 00:30:41,900
Speaker 1: But, like, you look at this photo of these three village girls in black and white, and it just looks super old-timey and almost depressing.

522
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:48,320
Speaker 1: You look at what the API did, and it just looks really, like, sad and washed out and sort of still old-timey.

523
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:53,599
Speaker 1: The actual photo, they're wearing amazing dresses, and it is not a sad photo at all.

524
00:30:56,081 --> 00:31:09,400
Speaker 1: So, be wary of the sources of colorized, I'm making quote motions, images from the past, if you don't know the process they used, because they often will be lying to you and setting subtle biases in how you interpret history.

525
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:12,079
Speaker 1: So, what do you got?

526
00:31:12,860 --> 00:31:13,843
Speaker 0: I got something real fun.

527
00:31:14,143 --> 00:31:20,639
Speaker 0: So, there was a movie in the 80s, movies like as old as we are, called Ninjas in the Dragon's Den, right?

528
00:31:21,021 --> 00:31:25,600
Speaker 0: It's, you know, some old, one of those silly 80s martial arts movies, the kind of anime hell of a situation.

529
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,079
Speaker 1: Oh my god, those ninja costumes.

530
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,499
Speaker 0: Right, this is the most stereotyped ninja thing you'll ever see.

531
00:31:33,841 --> 00:31:40,900
Speaker 0: And basically, at the beginning, the movie opens up with a three-minute sequence, and that's, like, where the credits play.

532
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:43,719
Speaker 0: Sort of like how a James Bond movie opens up with a credit thing, right?

533
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:48,479
Speaker 0: And it's this song, it's a great song, you'll love it.

534
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:58,200
Speaker 0: It's very of the period, and the three-minute sequence of the ninjas doing their ninja thing, it's like, do you even need to see the rest of this movie?

535
00:31:58,540 --> 00:32:05,640
Speaker 0: I don't know, but this is a really fun way to spend three minutes with some ninjas, if you've never seen this movie or the opening to it.

536
00:32:06,461 --> 00:32:13,420
Speaker 0: It is well worth your three minutes to have some fun 80s, you know, ninja action.

537
00:32:14,901 --> 00:32:22,740
Speaker 1: I, uh, I remember seeing the movie, oh god, three ninjas in the theater, because I was one of those kids who was into ninjas.

538
00:32:23,481 --> 00:32:25,311
Speaker 0: Did I see that in the theater or at home?

539
00:32:25,351 --> 00:32:26,940
Speaker 0: I don't know which one I saw either.

540
00:32:27,241 --> 00:32:31,540
Speaker 1: Not only did we see three ninjas in the theater, but we saw three ninjas kick back in the theater, I want to say.

541
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:37,480
Speaker 0: You know what I definitely 100% saw in the theater was, uh, what's the one with Chuck Norris and the kid?

542
00:32:38,045 --> 00:32:38,759
Speaker 1: Oh, Sidekick!

543
00:32:39,625 --> 00:32:39,999
Speaker 0: That one.

544
00:32:40,182 --> 00:32:41,579
Speaker 0: That movie- I saw that in the theater.

545
00:32:42,243 --> 00:32:44,351
Speaker 1: I, that movie messed with my kid brain.

546
00:32:44,994 --> 00:32:46,360
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure if Chuck Norris was real or not.

547
00:32:46,420 --> 00:32:49,540
Speaker 0: I don't remember anything about it other than that it was a movie with Chuck Norris and a kid.

548
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:54,220
Speaker 1: It was a kid who was bullied and he had this imaginary friend, Chuck Norris, who would, like, help him.

549
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:57,477
Speaker 0: But then he made that, like- I did not know that's what it was about.

550
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:00,460
Speaker 1: But then he, like- I've seen it.

551
00:33:00,460 --> 00:33:03,271
Speaker 1: Chuck Norris ends up being real and, like, actually fights with him.

552
00:33:03,371 --> 00:33:05,600
Speaker 1: Like, I don't, that is all I remember.

553
00:33:06,861 --> 00:33:07,599
Speaker 0: Okay, I remember less than that.

554
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:10,260
Speaker 1: Also, Chuck Norris is a bad person in real life, just in case anyone doesn't know.

555
00:33:10,503 --> 00:33:11,559
Speaker 0: Yes, Chuck Norris is bad.

556
00:33:12,203 --> 00:33:12,455
Speaker 0: Very bad.

557
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:21,580
Speaker 1: But, uh, after we watched Three Ninjas, my brother and I put on the blindfold, or the, the headbands, 'cause the theater gave every kid who showed up a Three Ninjas headband.

558
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,518
Speaker 1: It was a long time ago.

559
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:22,707
Speaker 0: Whoa.

560
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:28,680
Speaker 1: And, uh, we put them over our eyes, like blindfolds, and ran blindly into the parking lot for training.

561
00:33:29,142 --> 00:33:31,320
Speaker 1: And I ran straight into a parking sign.

562
00:33:32,369 --> 00:33:32,539
Speaker 0: Good.

563
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:37,540
Speaker 1: I, uh, I had, it looked like someone had punched me in the face.

564
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:46,640
Speaker 1: So I come home from this movie, and my dad is just like, you're gonna have to explain what happened to you when your mom asks you, 'cause I am not involved in this situation.

565
00:33:48,321 --> 00:33:55,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, that just reminds me of how sad I was as a kid, that on TV there would be commercials occasionally talking about, you know, special promotions like that, right?

566
00:33:56,545 --> 00:33:56,738
Speaker 0: Yup.

567
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:04,480
Speaker 0: And how literally never was, not even one time, were any of those actually happening in a place near me that I went.

568
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,920
Speaker 1: Wow, they were like always near me for some reason.

569
00:34:07,063 --> 00:34:07,740
Speaker 1: Like Lakeside bucket mall.

570
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,300
Speaker 0: It would be like, oh, go to, go to, go to this store.

571
00:34:10,440 --> 00:34:13,780
Speaker 0: There's a special limit, you know, like, uh, cup or whatever.

572
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:16,719
Speaker 0: And I'd go to the store, and they wouldn't, like, no, we don't have that.

573
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,480
Speaker 0: You know, it'd be like, you know, oh, if you go see this movie on this day, you'll get a toy.

574
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:22,978
Speaker 0: Nope, no toys there.

575
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,159
Speaker 0: I think what was going on is- None of those things.

576
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:26,399
Speaker 1: We, like, we weren't rich.

577
00:34:26,561 --> 00:34:29,060
Speaker 1: We lived, uh, we didn't live in the gray part, like the gray neighborhood.

578
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:34,819
Speaker 1: But, if we drove far enough, there was a fancy mall, fancy relative to the mall we would go to.

579
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:35,998
Speaker 0: There's a mall right next to my house.

580
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:42,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, for whatever reason, the fancy mall in the nice suburbs that we drive out to all the time instead of the crappy mall near us.

581
00:34:43,021 --> 00:34:44,839
Speaker 1: Every single movie promotion was there.

582
00:34:45,621 --> 00:34:49,139
Speaker 1: Like, every tchotchke you would possibly want would be there on opening night.

583
00:34:49,840 --> 00:34:53,159
Speaker 0: The only ones we got occasionally were, like, the ones that would, like, come in in the newspaper.

584
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:54,440
Speaker 0: 'Cause we'd always buy newspapers.

585
00:34:55,201 --> 00:34:56,379
Speaker 0: We'd get those kinds of things.

586
00:34:56,840 --> 00:35:01,380
Speaker 0: I think there was one time there was, like, the thing was it was, like, a McDonald's vinyl record in the newspaper, I think I remember.

587
00:35:02,524 --> 00:35:03,599
Speaker 0: I don't, I gotta look that up.

588
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:09,100
Speaker 1: Well, there was a, I mean, the McDonald's vinyl was part of that ad campaign where you had to memorize the song.

589
00:35:10,564 --> 00:35:12,078
Speaker 0: I don't remember anything about it.

590
00:35:12,402 --> 00:35:13,439
Speaker 0: Other than what I just said.

591
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,820
Speaker 1: Okay, interesting.

592
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:22,059
Speaker 1: I tried memorizing that song, and I would perform it on command for other adults because the adults all thought it was funny.

593
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:23,906
Speaker 1: Okay.

594
00:35:24,441 --> 00:35:29,920
Speaker 1: And the contest was, if you got the vinyl, it had the real song, and then it had someone attempting to sing the song.

595
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:35,420
Speaker 1: And if the person attempting to sing the song and the vinyl you got succeeded, you won some cash prize.

596
00:35:35,641 --> 00:35:37,400
Speaker 1: And, of course, nobody actually won that thing, but.

597
00:35:38,963 --> 00:35:40,660
Speaker 0: I don't know why I remember this so specifically.

598
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:44,740
Speaker 0: There's an article here that says what happened to the winner of McDonald's 1 million Flexidisc contest.

599
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:47,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know, 'cause there were two contests.

600
00:35:47,642 --> 00:35:50,640
Speaker 0: In 1989, a 13-year-old boy in Galax, Virginia thought he'd won.

601
00:35:51,604 --> 00:35:54,480
Speaker 0: His family suddenly had money, but with it, more problems.

602
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:54,999
Speaker 0: That's right.

603
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:55,979
Speaker 1: Interesting, yeah.

604
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:56,438
Speaker 1: More problems.

605
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:57,840
Speaker 0: Well.

606
00:35:58,820 --> 00:35:59,519
Speaker 1: Otherwise, metamoment.

607
00:36:00,265 --> 00:36:01,540
Speaker 1: We're still locked inside.

608
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:04,379
Speaker 1: Like, I just got my second shot less than a week ago.

609
00:36:04,700 --> 00:36:05,013
Speaker 1: Stay tuned.

610
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:06,940
Speaker 0: I got mine maybe a week.

611
00:36:07,701 --> 00:36:09,679
Speaker 0: I guess a week and a day ago, I guess?

612
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:10,067
Speaker 1: Yep.

613
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:13,140
Speaker 1: Give me another week, and I'm not gonna change much in my life.

614
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,719
Speaker 1: Like, things are still not great out there.

615
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:18,500
Speaker 0: Well, you know, if it was warm, I would go outside more.

616
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,240
Speaker 1: I mean, if it's warm enough, I'm going outside more.

617
00:36:21,805 --> 00:36:22,319
Speaker 0: It's a little cold.

618
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:22,894
Speaker 1: A little cold?

619
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,400
Speaker 1: This is like hiking weekend.

620
00:36:24,441 --> 00:36:25,639
Speaker 0: And it's gonna rain for like a week.

621
00:36:26,622 --> 00:36:27,959
Speaker 1: It's not gonna rain much on Sunday.

622
00:36:29,723 --> 00:36:29,938
Speaker 0: It's cold.

623
00:36:30,585 --> 00:36:31,302
Speaker 0: It's like 60.

624
00:36:31,302 --> 00:36:31,780
Speaker 0: It's fine.

625
00:36:32,509 --> 00:36:32,799
Speaker 0: It's cold.

626
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:35,679
Speaker 1: How did you get so old so fast?

627
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,840
Speaker 0: You know, the Earth, it kept going around the sun.

628
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,359
Speaker 0: It couldn't stop.

629
00:36:41,823 --> 00:36:43,820
Speaker 1: So let's just get right into it, because I'm hungry.

630
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:44,380
Speaker 1: It's Thursday.

631
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:44,898
Speaker 0: It's the lounge.

632
00:36:45,261 --> 00:36:45,919
Speaker 0: No metamoment action?

633
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:46,438
Speaker 0: I don't know.

634
00:36:46,641 --> 00:36:48,000
Speaker 1: All our stuff's on the internet.

635
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,280
Speaker 1: Our Discord's rocking.

636
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,053
Speaker 1: You should join it.

637
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:53,140
Speaker 0: The book club book is The Tale of Genji.

638
00:36:53,160 --> 00:36:53,939
Speaker 1: The Tale of Genji?

639
00:36:55,901 --> 00:36:57,060
Speaker 1: I'm reading it slowly.

640
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:58,818
Speaker 0: Genji is not a ninja.

641
00:37:02,644 --> 00:37:03,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's just get into it.

642
00:37:04,643 --> 00:37:07,100
Speaker 1: So, in America, you know, we're Americans.

643
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:17,560
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about this from an English-speaking American perspective, because this is a country where white people born here don't really need to speak any other languages to get by, usually.

644
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:33,934
Speaker 0: Thanks to the imperialism of the UK primarily, but also the United States, English has imposed, much like the US dollar, English as a language has imposed its will upon the rest of the world, which is a privilege and benefit of us.

645
00:37:33,994 --> 00:37:36,700
Speaker 0: that was not our fault, but we benefit from it greatly.

646
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,440
Speaker 1: Hey, at least we displace French as the lingua franca.

647
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,100
Speaker 0: That's sure.

648
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:43,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's funny.

649
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,036
Speaker 0: The lingua franca is not English.

650
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:47,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, I never thought about that before.

651
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:56,420
Speaker 0: But yeah, I can go to most countries, and as long as I'm in heavily populated areas, especially, if I go to any airport, you know, things will be written in English.

652
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:59,280
Speaker 0: There'll be people who speak English around.

653
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:04,270
Speaker 0: You know, you can get through life, even if you travel frequently, with only English.

654
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:05,720
Speaker 1: Talk about my day job.

655
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:32,600
Speaker 1: I've spent a decade flying around the world doing business, like, everywhere, in places where very few people speak English, and I've made it out just fine with, like, let's see, some high school French, a little, I can read Turkish phonetically, and I know a few basic words that are useful for, like, ordering things, and I know a bunch of random Japanese nouns and verbs thanks to anime.

656
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:33,937
Speaker 1: Like, that's about the extent of it.

657
00:38:34,820 --> 00:38:42,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I learned, you know, because I'm a Jew in Hebrew school, they taught us, it was really annoying to me that they would teach us to read Hebrew, right?

658
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,559
Speaker 0: So, I can, I guess I've forgotten some portion of it, because I haven't,

659
00:38:47,821 --> 00:38:52,608
Speaker 1: well, like, how to read it phonetically, like, read it, like, you can look at the alphabet, and you can say the word out loud,

660
00:38:56,541 --> 00:38:59,396
Speaker 0: perfectly, with perfect pronunciation, and someone says, "What does that word

661
00:38:59,437 --> 00:38:59,539
Speaker 0: mean?".

662
00:38:59,601 --> 00:39:00,579
Speaker 0: Like, I have no fucking idea.

663
00:39:00,825 --> 00:39:00,915
Speaker 0: Yup.

664
00:39:01,781 --> 00:39:06,920
Speaker 1: That was useful to me in Turkey, because I had to drive there, and I had to, like, do a lot of crap completely on my own.

665
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:18,000
Speaker 1: So, while I didn't know Turkish, I could say any word I could see perfectly, and that was super useful asking for directions.

666
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,159
Speaker 1: Like, that actually saved me many times.

667
00:39:22,480 --> 00:39:22,625
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

668
00:39:23,622 --> 00:39:29,280
Speaker 0: And then, for Spanish, so, in middle school, for all of middle school, they made us take a second language.

669
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,080
Speaker 0: You could choose Spanish, French, basically.

670
00:39:31,140 --> 00:39:33,100
Speaker 1: That's something that came, like, while we were kids.

671
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:49,657
Speaker 1: Like, America wasn't big on learning other languages, generally, but there was a revolution where in the late '70s, early '80s, there started to be this idea that every kid in America should at least learn, while they're in, like, K-12 education, one other language, and some schools started to require it.

672
00:39:50,641 --> 00:39:52,120
Speaker 0: So, the choices were Spanish and French.

673
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,038
Speaker 0: I chose Spanish.

674
00:39:53,624 --> 00:39:54,219
Speaker 1: Oh, that's all you had?

675
00:39:54,542 --> 00:39:56,660
Speaker 1: I went to a fancier school, I guess.

676
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,860
Speaker 0: Well, in high school, there were more choices.

677
00:39:58,281 --> 00:40:03,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, our default choices, like the normal ones, were French, Spanish, German, and Italian.

678
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:09,879
Speaker 1: Those are, like, the four, but there was one Latin class, there was one Japanese class, and there was one Russian class.

679
00:40:10,661 --> 00:40:14,720
Speaker 0: Yup, so yes, in high school, it was pretty much what you described, but in middle school, you had two choices.

680
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:16,900
Speaker 0: So, in middle school, I took three years of Spanish, right?

681
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:22,371
Speaker 0: And then, in high school, you know, they kept telling you, like, "Oh, man, you want to succeed in life?

682
00:40:22,692 --> 00:40:24,059
Speaker 0: You want a college to accept you?

683
00:40:24,421 --> 00:40:26,500
Speaker 0: You better take four years of foreign language, right?

684
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:29,035
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you know, your college just won't accept

685
00:40:29,055 --> 00:40:29,155
Speaker 0: you.".

686
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,930
Speaker 1: I did not take the full four years.

687
00:40:32,011 --> 00:40:33,840
Speaker 1: I stopped taking French my senior year.

688
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,257
Speaker 0: And then they said, "In order to graduate, you need two

689
00:40:36,298 --> 00:40:36,520
Speaker 0: years.".

690
00:40:36,662 --> 00:40:37,840
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Wait a minute, wait a minute.

691
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:54,278
Speaker 0: You're saying you give me the high school diploma with only two years, but, you know, you're really encouraging the four, but you've got all these other classes available in this school that I can take, computer classes, you know, all kinds of fun stuff, and I basically can choose to do those instead of

692
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:54,520
Speaker 0: these.".

693
00:40:54,902 --> 00:41:06,098
Speaker 0: So I did the minimum two years of Spanish in high school, and as a result, my Spanish is actually, you know, it's like, there are some verbs I know how to conjugate, but I've, you know, forgotten some.

694
00:41:07,123 --> 00:41:14,053
Speaker 0: And then, but it's like, I can read, like, even today, you know, that second year of high school was 1998, right?

695
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:26,299
Speaker 0: So it's been a long time since I studied any Spanish or spoke it at all, and I couldn't really hold a conversation if someone was, you know, with a fluent person who was speaking at their normal speed.

696
00:41:26,781 --> 00:41:32,891
Speaker 0: But I can read, like, the signs on the subway that are in Spanish, like 80% of what's on the sign.

697
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:34,620
Speaker 0: You know, it's mostly vocabulary.

698
00:41:34,761 --> 00:41:40,199
Speaker 0: Like, I don't know what that word means, you know, but I understand the sentence structure and enough words that I get the idea.

699
00:41:42,441 --> 00:41:43,930
Speaker 0: So that's, you know, surprising.

700
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:48,635
Speaker 0: It was actually surprising to me that, like, I still know as much Spanish as I do, right?

701
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,580
Speaker 0: Considering how little effort I put into it, other than five years of classes that I had to take.

702
00:41:55,780 --> 00:42:03,760
Speaker 1: I think what helps is that just living in a diverse city, we encounter Spanish a lot, so there's a lot of signs in Spanish.

703
00:42:03,820 --> 00:42:20,880
Speaker 1: Like, you sort of just, like, you gotta know a lot of basic words if you're gonna live in New York and not just be that guy, so... But French, like, doesn't really come up in my life at all, 'cause I ended up picking French because in my school, the basic ones were offered at multiple times, so it was pretty easy to schedule.

704
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:25,440
Speaker 1: I wanted to take Japanese, 'cause I was a mega wee starting in elementary school.

705
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:28,960
Speaker 1: Japanese was during band, and I wasn't gonna give up music.

706
00:42:29,802 --> 00:42:30,753
Speaker 1: So then I was like, "Oh, I'll do

707
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:31,117
Speaker 1: Russian.".

708
00:42:31,621 --> 00:42:34,860
Speaker 1: Russian was during all the advanced math classes, so I couldn't do Russian.

709
00:42:35,480 --> 00:42:39,286
Speaker 1: Basically, all the interesting languages I wanted to take were during a class.

710
00:42:39,326 --> 00:42:41,960
Speaker 1: I wanted to take more, so I had to pick one of the default four.

711
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,659
Speaker 1: I picked French semi-randomly.

712
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:48,518
Speaker 1: I didn't have any particular rationale behind it, I just picked it.

713
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:52,259
Speaker 0: I picked Spanish just aesthetically, you know.

714
00:42:53,043 --> 00:42:58,340
Speaker 0: And also the fact that I thought it would be more likely that I'd go to, like, you know, Mexico than it would be.

715
00:42:58,802 --> 00:43:03,480
Speaker 1: I lived on the border of Canada, and we would go into Canada and head out toward Montreal.

716
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:05,360
Speaker 0: That's true, you were closer to Canada.

717
00:43:06,083 --> 00:43:08,620
Speaker 0: I mean, I was also closer to Canada than I was to Mexico.

718
00:43:08,700 --> 00:43:14,340
Speaker 1: But where I grew up, a lot of things in the grocery store would be in English and French instead of English and Spanish.

719
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:16,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wasn't that close.

720
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:22,480
Speaker 1: So I picked French, and it was an okay time, but I only took a few years of it.

721
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:25,200
Speaker 1: My senior year, I just bailed on it, 'cause I was done with high school.

722
00:43:25,682 --> 00:43:29,178
Speaker 1: But then RIT was like, "Oh, it didn't take four years of language for the IT

723
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:29,620
Speaker 1: program.".

724
00:43:29,962 --> 00:43:32,860
Speaker 1: I had to get a minimum number of language credits to get my degree.

725
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,580
Speaker 0: Oh, computer science did not have that.

726
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:35,806
Speaker 1: RIT had that.

727
00:43:35,947 --> 00:43:37,175
Speaker 1: I had to take some language classes.

728
00:43:37,457 --> 00:43:37,980
Speaker 1: You know what I did?

729
00:43:38,641 --> 00:43:41,597
Speaker 1: I signed up for, like, intermediate French II.

730
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:51,300
Speaker 1: Like, I just picked French classes that looked like they were below what I could speak so they'd be easy, and tried to just basically take French again to get the credits.

731
00:43:51,762 --> 00:43:52,605
Speaker 1: And it totally worked.

732
00:43:52,846 --> 00:43:56,220
Speaker 1: I skipped the entirety of those French classes and passed all the exams.

733
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:57,413
Speaker 0: Sounds good.

734
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,264
Speaker 0: It worked out.

735
00:43:58,325 --> 00:43:58,950
Speaker 1: I graduated.

736
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:00,120
Speaker 1: You can't take my diploma away.

737
00:44:01,020 --> 00:44:01,201
Speaker 0: Yeah.

738
00:44:01,361 --> 00:44:11,892
Speaker 0: So I put, you know, like with most things later in life, right, not just learning languages but other hobbies, right, it's like, you know, there are some where it's like, "I thought I would start 'em, but you didn't really," right?

739
00:44:11,912 --> 00:44:12,576
Speaker 0: It's like, "I bought a

740
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:13,179
Speaker 0: harmonica.".

741
00:44:13,663 --> 00:44:14,189
Speaker 0: No, right?

742
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:15,059
Speaker 0: It's like, I didn't practice.

743
00:44:15,423 --> 00:44:16,169
Speaker 1: I kept practicing.

744
00:44:16,189 --> 00:44:17,359
Speaker 1: I'm pretty good at that harmonica now.

745
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:18,586
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's annoying.

746
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:21,640
Speaker 0: I didn't have the discipline to stick with it, right?

747
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:25,880
Speaker 0: So, like, I think I tried for, like, maybe, like, a week to, like, to read Japanese.

748
00:44:26,502 --> 00:44:29,140
Speaker 0: You know, I could read the katakanas for, like, a little bit.

749
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,171
Speaker 1: Oh, remember, I learned Hangul, like, fully.

750
00:44:32,191 --> 00:44:34,460
Speaker 1: Like, I could read Hangul phonetically, and I learned basic Korean.

751
00:44:34,460 --> 00:44:34,996
Speaker 1: Can you read it now?

752
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,190
Speaker 1: No, I forgot it all, 'cause I never used it.

753
00:44:37,713 --> 00:44:38,719
Speaker 1: This is way before K-pop.

754
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:47,815
Speaker 0: Right, so it's like, you know, my, I never put the effort in, I didn't have the discipline, and then it, so I failed a couple times, and I said, "All right, I give up,".

755
00:44:48,237 --> 00:44:49,702
Speaker 0: and now it's like, "I should learn,".

756
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:54,179
Speaker 0: but it's like, "No, I already know I don't have the discipline, so why

757
00:44:54,219 --> 00:44:54,419
Speaker 0: start?".

758
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:56,970
Speaker 1: So I had something change for me in that.

759
00:44:57,351 --> 00:45:06,840
Speaker 1: part of the reason why I'd forget this stuff was that I just don't use it in my daily life unless I might go out of my way to use it, and I am not the kind of person who has a hammer and goes around looking for nails.

760
00:45:08,243 --> 00:45:10,300
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, exactly, exactly.

761
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:16,024
Speaker 1: But I did, I decided, 'cause Emily's been doing Duolingo just to, like, pick up a lot of basic Spanish, and it's worked out really well.

762
00:45:16,184 --> 00:45:19,900
Speaker 1: Like, read Spanish and understand it pretty well, like, it worked out.

763
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:25,920
Speaker 1: It was very low effort, and it provided that constant context, you know, just poke at it for ten minutes once a day.

764
00:45:26,602 --> 00:45:29,780
Speaker 1: So I started doing it for French, and I learned something fascinating.

765
00:45:30,820 --> 00:45:39,260
Speaker 1: I weirdly have a, like, extremely strong understanding of French grammar and structure and diction and pronunciation still.

766
00:45:40,301 --> 00:45:42,149
Speaker 1: All I'd lost was the vocabulary.

767
00:45:42,451 --> 00:45:44,640
Speaker 1: I didn't know any fucking words anymore at all.

768
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:48,172
Speaker 1: I remembered a lot of, like, verbs, but that was it.

769
00:45:48,272 --> 00:45:50,440
Speaker 1: Like, nouns for anything were just gone from my brain.

770
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,070
Speaker 0: It's actually not, I haven't thought of that before, right?

771
00:45:54,150 --> 00:46:02,260
Speaker 0: 'Cause, like, the languages that I think would be useful to me that I want to learn, right, are, like, you know, Japanese, Korean, right?

772
00:46:02,520 --> 00:46:07,540
Speaker 0: You know, like, these languages where I can then access, you know, media, right, without subtitles.

773
00:46:07,821 --> 00:46:08,082
Speaker 0: Well, like,

774
00:46:08,122 --> 00:46:21,560
Speaker 1: I was even learning hiragana just 'cause that made it easy to be able to do things like read straight signs when we were traveling in Japan, and I knew it for a while, but then we didn't go back to Japan for a long time, and I literally forgot most of it because I don't need it in my daily life.

775
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:32,010
Speaker 0: Right, but it's like now, it's like thanks to literally just within this recording this podcast, it's like, you know, I already know enough Spanish to read signs on the subway.

776
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:38,850
Speaker 0: if I just put, I could probably, you know, become maybe even fluent in Spanish if I tried, right?

777
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:50,840
Speaker 0: You know, considering that I have, like, a head start of some amount, you know, maybe that would work out better if I did that instead of trying to learn something that not only, I don't, I know nothing and has a different alphabet.

778
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:51,622
Speaker 1: Yup.

779
00:46:51,642 --> 00:47:02,808
Speaker 1: Now, but the way I learn languages, 'cause I realize, like, doing Duolingo, like, it's very, like, immersion, like, it gives you a sentence and makes you translate it without telling you anything, but with, like, multiple choice, like, it does that kind of stuff.

780
00:47:02,849 --> 00:47:05,180
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna, like, turn this into a Duolingo ad or anything.

781
00:47:05,862 --> 00:47:15,284
Speaker 1: But I think I would not have liked that application at all if it weren't for the fact that I already know the, a good deal of how French works.

782
00:47:15,846 --> 00:47:25,380
Speaker 1: So the only thing I'm learning is relearning the vocabulary and relearning stuff like which words are feminine and masculine and all that gendered nonsense.

783
00:47:26,861 --> 00:47:35,845
Speaker 1: But, like, I don't, like, 'cause when I learn languages, I would, like, rather read about grammar for a year before I say even one sentence.

784
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:40,260
Speaker 1: Like, I like to learn structure and rules first before I start learning content.

785
00:47:41,722 --> 00:47:45,260
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't really, you know, I don't know which way is the best way.

786
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,809
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't think that's the best way.

787
00:47:46,830 --> 00:47:48,480
Speaker 1: I think that's just how I have engaged.

788
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,800
Speaker 0: No, I mean, for me, I don't know what the best way for me to learn is either, right?

789
00:47:51,820 --> 00:47:53,204
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's like.

790
00:47:53,244 --> 00:48:05,720
Speaker 0: how much, you know, I've consumed so much media in various languages with subtitles and I pick up words, you know, and I eventually learn what they mean, but I still can't speak or read those languages at all, right?

791
00:48:05,860 --> 00:48:10,780
Speaker 0: Even though it's been many, many years of consuming piles and piles of media for some of them, right?

792
00:48:11,660 --> 00:48:17,020
Speaker 1: That's kind of why I'm doing this app thing 'cause it just, it forces me to see the language and engage with it a tiny bit every single day.

793
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:17,820
Speaker 0: It seems like it's working.

794
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:21,580
Speaker 0: I did pirate those Rosetta apps way back in the beacon days.

795
00:48:21,580 --> 00:48:23,110
Speaker 0: They were not great.

796
00:48:23,231 --> 00:48:24,257
Speaker 1: I also pirated them.

797
00:48:24,740 --> 00:48:25,248
Speaker 0: They did not work.

798
00:48:25,268 --> 00:48:26,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't pay for them.

799
00:48:26,100 --> 00:48:31,800
Speaker 0: They charged so much money for those, but yeah, they didn't really work for me at all and I wasn't able to stick with those either.

800
00:48:31,860 --> 00:48:34,079
Speaker 0: I didn't have the discipline, so it didn't work.

801
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:34,810
Speaker 1: Yup.

802
00:48:36,241 --> 00:48:49,539
Speaker 1: So, I'm gonna keep this up and see if I have rudimentary French again by the time we go to France 'cause I actually haven't been to Paris in, God, it's been a long time now and I wanna actually go there on a vacation instead of for work.

803
00:48:50,580 --> 00:49:02,080
Speaker 0: Maybe, yeah, maybe I should try the, you know, it's like to become fluent in Spanish from where I am should be theoretically less work than from nothing in some other language, right?

804
00:49:02,280 --> 00:49:02,368
Speaker 0: Yeah.

805
00:49:02,600 --> 00:49:12,720
Speaker 0: And although I'm not interested in Spanish media, you know, it's like maybe, like there are plenty of Spanish-speaking people all around here.

806
00:49:13,141 --> 00:49:16,200
Speaker 1: It's just generally useful, especially in a cosmopolitan city.

807
00:49:16,602 --> 00:49:20,780
Speaker 0: It would be actually very useful if I could just actually engage in a conversation.

808
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:26,860
Speaker 1: What's funny though is so, you know, I used to spend a lot of time in Turkey to the point that I was like earnestly trying to learn Turkish.

809
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:48,718
Speaker 1: Like I was studying the language, I had a bunch of grammar books, I would like try to use it when I was there, but literally every single person I used any Turkish words with, like I'm not even exaggerating, 100% of the people, if they spoke English at all, they would tell me, they would literally just be like, "Why are you speaking Turkish?

810
00:49:48,738 --> 00:49:49,480
Speaker 1: Don't learn our language.

811
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:51,208
Speaker 1: No one else on earth speaks it.

812
00:49:51,228 --> 00:49:51,751
Speaker 1: There's no point.

813
00:49:51,771 --> 00:49:52,274
Speaker 1: You're wasting your

814
00:49:52,294 --> 00:49:52,455
Speaker 1: time.".

815
00:49:53,961 --> 00:49:56,449
Speaker 1: They were like oddly insistent, like, "No, don't bother.

816
00:49:56,770 --> 00:50:00,160
Speaker 1: Like this language, I love my language, but no one speaks it outside of Turkey.

817
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:01,877
Speaker 1: Unless you move here, you will never use it in your

818
00:50:01,897 --> 00:50:02,058
Speaker 1: life.".

819
00:50:02,561 --> 00:50:06,619
Speaker 1: And they were like specifically earnestly insistent about that.

820
00:50:09,142 --> 00:50:10,200
Speaker 1: It's also a neat language.

821
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:16,779
Speaker 0: Their perspective was like, you know, that, you know, their perspective is like, man, you know, learning English for them, right?

822
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,239
Speaker 1: Like opens up the world.

823
00:50:18,861 --> 00:50:19,041
Speaker 0: Right.

824
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:21,249
Speaker 0: It opens up doors for them, right?

825
00:50:21,309 --> 00:50:24,320
Speaker 0: Whereas knowing only Turkish, they sort of feel trapped.

826
00:50:24,421 --> 00:50:26,880
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like, why would you want to learn Turkish?

827
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:33,700
Speaker 0: It's like being able to access this tiny, it's like this little tiny box that, you know, even from their perspective of being Turkish people, right?

828
00:50:35,462 --> 00:50:40,620
Speaker 0: You know, but other people are like, yes, please learn our, you know, we want people to learn our language.

829
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:43,893
Speaker 0: We want to spread our culture and share with you, right?

830
00:50:43,913 --> 00:50:45,720
Speaker 0: It's just different attitudes and different places.

831
00:50:48,201 --> 00:50:49,165
Speaker 1: So yeah, we'll see.

832
00:50:49,185 --> 00:50:53,400
Speaker 1: I'm going to give this like a year and see how far my French gets along and decide what to do from there.

833
00:50:53,801 --> 00:50:58,400
Speaker 1: I was vaguely thinking if I wanted to learn a language more deeply, I was honestly thinking about German.

834
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,680
Speaker 1: Because in terms of places I might end up, long term.

835
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:03,439
Speaker 0: The board game business?

836
00:51:04,140 --> 00:51:13,600
Speaker 1: Well, not so much the board, like the board games would be a bonus, but more in terms of like what country generally is closer to like the political ideals I have as a structure.

837
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:14,658
Speaker 0: When you learn Dutch then?

838
00:51:15,401 --> 00:51:16,454
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah, that would work too.

839
00:51:17,564 --> 00:51:17,817
Speaker 1: Finnish?

840
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,457
Speaker 0: Say something like that?

841
00:51:21,961 --> 00:51:23,727
Speaker 1: German seems like it would be generally useful.

842
00:51:23,787 --> 00:51:27,720
Speaker 1: Also, I do, in the course of my work, I encounter a lot of German speaking people.

843
00:51:28,161 --> 00:51:31,018
Speaker 1: I also have a bunch of engineering teams in Frankfurt right now.

844
00:51:32,602 --> 00:51:36,500
Speaker 1: So I would actually like have an excuse to use that language because I do enter.

845
00:51:36,900 --> 00:51:43,540
Speaker 1: There are people I would like to interact with more who do not have like, they're not fluent in English, they're fluent in German.

846
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:47,380
Speaker 1: They interact with me in English because I'm the product manager, but like I don't speak German.

847
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,460
Speaker 1: So I would earnestly like to be able to engage with them more directly.

848
00:51:52,080 --> 00:52:01,180
Speaker 1: But that would be a much, just using a language, like planning to use the language for that purpose is a much bigger commitment than learning French for like a trip I'm going to take to France.

849
00:52:02,701 --> 00:52:09,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, at my work they actually, there were so many frequent requests coming, you know, they were like at the front desk or at other places in the company, right?

850
00:52:10,860 --> 00:52:18,498
Speaker 0: They'd like get a contract from like a French songwriter or something and they'd, they'd send a message out, like broadcast like, "Is there anyone in the office who speaks, who's fluent in

851
00:52:18,658 --> 00:52:18,678
Speaker 0: X?".

852
00:52:19,661 --> 00:52:20,848
Speaker 0: It happened frequently enough.

853
00:52:21,310 --> 00:52:23,260
Speaker 0: They created a company-wide directory.

854
00:52:23,960 --> 00:52:26,700
Speaker 0: So you could find the people who are fluent in X. We

855
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:45,140
Speaker 1: have a similar directory and you can also, in all of our internal systems, if your name has a spelling that uses characters, diacritics or anything that would be different in different contexts, you can actually input your name for all those different contexts and it'll show up appropriately depending on what language is being used.

856
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:46,379
Speaker 0: That's good.

857
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:47,120
Speaker 1: It's really neat.

858
00:52:47,980 --> 00:53:03,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, you know, if anyone out there is, you know, I definitely, you know, believe that even if you are, have the benefit of, you know, already knowing English because you were born in a place that speaks English or, you know, that learning another language is very valuable.

859
00:53:04,120 --> 00:53:05,759
Speaker 0: You know, don't, don't do as I do.

860
00:53:06,986 --> 00:53:07,719
Speaker 0: Do as I say.

861
00:53:08,040 --> 00:53:09,780
Speaker 0: Don't do as I don't does, right?

862
00:53:10,982 --> 00:53:14,600
Speaker 0: You know, learning more languages is, you know, just awesome.

863
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:21,300
Speaker 0: It helps you and it's, you know, it, I would, if someone who knows more than one language, I have respect for them, right?

864
00:53:21,480 --> 00:53:26,700
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, you can, you know, it's just, uh, it's just all around positive.

865
00:53:27,460 --> 00:53:32,460
Speaker 0: You know, it would be nice if the whole world spoke one language and everyone could communicate easily.

866
00:53:33,302 --> 00:53:37,220
Speaker 0: Uh, but that also is, you know, language also affects how people think.

867
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:40,340
Speaker 0: So that would make people all think the same way as well.

868
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:40,880
Speaker 0: And that's not.

869
00:53:41,122 --> 00:53:43,040
Speaker 1: Ah, so that's something I think about a lot.

870
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:47,760
Speaker 0: And it would also, it also do, you know, erase a lot of cultures, which is even less great.

871
00:53:48,260 --> 00:53:52,860
Speaker 1: Well, so are you familiar with the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis?

872
00:53:54,222 --> 00:53:56,419
Speaker 0: No, but I'm pretty sure I can guess what it is.

873
00:53:56,980 --> 00:54:11,500
Speaker 1: Uh, it's the idea that the set of languages you speak best and use the most in your own head materially affect your worldview and cognition and how you approach and interact with things.

874
00:54:12,332 --> 00:54:12,738
Speaker 0: I believe it.

875
00:54:13,682 --> 00:54:18,000
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of debate on how strong it is and how much, like, there's some, there's evidence for it.

876
00:54:18,343 --> 00:54:19,559
Speaker 1: There's weak evidence against it.

877
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,640
Speaker 1: There's, it's a whole, but the culture books, those sci-fi books are based on it.

878
00:54:24,760 --> 00:54:31,719
Speaker 1: A big part of the culture is the idea that the machines make up a new language and over time get all humans to speak it.

879
00:54:32,161 --> 00:54:40,380
Speaker 1: But that language is subtly designed to reduce aggression and increase curiosity and things like that.

880
00:54:41,442 --> 00:54:48,460
Speaker 1: That is like a fascinating field we are in no way competent to speak to beyond maybe the next couple minutes.

881
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:49,380
Speaker 0: Right.

882
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:59,760
Speaker 0: An observation I have made, you know, especially in our forum, but just around the internet as well, are people who will argue about something, whatever the something is, and they'll make some semantic argument, right?

883
00:54:59,880 --> 00:55:05,500
Speaker 0: And then they'll be like, aha, these words mean X, therefore this thing about reality.

884
00:55:05,641 --> 00:55:07,540
Speaker 0: And it's like, I think people have a heart.

885
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:14,820
Speaker 0: I'm always intentionally forcing myself to sort of separate and be like, you know, the way the world works.

886
00:55:15,361 --> 00:55:15,583
Speaker 0: Right.

887
00:55:15,824 --> 00:55:18,760
Speaker 0: Has nothing to do with the words that we've invented.

888
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:19,060
Speaker 0: Right.

889
00:55:19,101 --> 00:55:29,180
Speaker 0: We, you know, even things like, you know, we say we talk about like physics and chemistry, like these two separate things, you know, conceptually, it's like, you know, in order to understand them, we need that framework.

890
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:31,580
Speaker 0: But it's like, there's no actual separation.

891
00:55:31,580 --> 00:55:32,893
Speaker 0: The universe is the universe.

892
00:55:33,980 --> 00:55:34,719
Speaker 0: Atoms are atoms.

893
00:55:35,141 --> 00:55:35,245
Speaker 0: Yeah.

894
00:55:35,308 --> 00:55:35,580
Speaker 0: Right.

895
00:55:36,663 --> 00:55:39,260
Speaker 0: You know, why are you thinking about those things separately?

896
00:55:39,781 --> 00:55:42,620
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like, well, that's why I'm such a big fan.

897
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:44,723
Speaker 1: And we do this in our talks all the time of.

898
00:55:45,123 --> 00:55:58,180
Speaker 1: if we're going to make a like very focused or semantic based argument, we'll at least set the agree on the definitions of the things we're going to use for the debate in advance and agree that those definitions are not universal.

899
00:55:58,281 --> 00:56:00,860
Speaker 1: They're just for the purpose of this particular thought experiment.

900
00:56:01,563 --> 00:56:04,599
Speaker 0: But if you speak a different language, you have different words available to you.

901
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:05,040
Speaker 0: Right.

902
00:56:05,060 --> 00:56:12,400
Speaker 0: Maybe that maybe the some theoretical language has a word for something and that word encompasses some parts of physics and some parts of chemistry.

903
00:56:12,701 --> 00:56:18,660
Speaker 0: But it's still anyone who speaks that language would clearly understand that word, whatever it is, its own thing.

904
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,040
Speaker 0: It's like they could teach a class in school on that thing.

905
00:56:21,060 --> 00:56:30,760
Speaker 1: That's one of the reasons why Latin is used for a lot of like scientific terms, because since it's not a like actively spoken language, it's not going to evolve significantly.

906
00:56:32,121 --> 00:56:42,720
Speaker 1: So its meaning will remain relatively constant and untouched by culture or at least less touched by culture because it's still touched by the culture of the person who chose a particular Latin word or Latin sounding word.

907
00:56:43,760 --> 00:57:00,240
Speaker 1: But another idea in that space is some languages have concepts like when you use a noun or a verb like verbs, verbs that imply something happened have varying degrees of how much truth there is to it.

908
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:05,420
Speaker 1: Like there are languages that if I say I went to the store, I could use a different word than went.

909
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:07,225
Speaker 1: That means I went to the store.

910
00:57:07,245 --> 00:57:08,710
Speaker 1: I am saying 100 percent.

911
00:57:08,730 --> 00:57:11,600
Speaker 1: this is literal truth versus I went to the store.

912
00:57:12,342 --> 00:57:13,024
Speaker 1: But I'm not like.

913
00:57:13,145 --> 00:57:14,832
Speaker 1: I'm not saying this as a literal truth.

914
00:57:15,374 --> 00:57:16,639
Speaker 1: English has nothing like that.

915
00:57:17,442 --> 00:57:20,200
Speaker 0: And then you got languages with gendered pronouns.

916
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:24,110
Speaker 1: I'm so like not jazzed about it.

917
00:57:24,591 --> 00:57:27,080
Speaker 1: I forgot how much I hate the gendering in French.

918
00:57:27,943 --> 00:57:28,506
Speaker 0: Yeah.

919
00:57:28,546 --> 00:57:32,040
Speaker 0: There's so much stuff like that going on, you know, all all the different aspects.

920
00:57:32,260 --> 00:57:32,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

921
00:57:32,543 --> 00:57:34,340
Speaker 0: And the way they are thinking.

922
00:57:37,443 --> 00:57:38,860
Speaker 1: That's the word I'll use for computer.

923
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:39,701
Speaker 0: Right.

924
00:57:40,201 --> 00:57:56,760
Speaker 0: And, you know, I think that learning more languages and, you know, getting those, you know, especially if you can go above two languages, you can start to sort of erase those sort of controls on your brain to some extent, maybe, you know, but just it's a good thing.

925
00:57:57,421 --> 00:57:57,922
Speaker 0: So you're not.

926
00:57:57,982 --> 00:58:08,640
Speaker 0: And also, from what I've read, I'm not 100 percent sure on this, but I've read it in several places that the idea that like, oh, kids can just pick up languages and it's hard for adults.

927
00:58:09,182 --> 00:58:10,639
Speaker 0: I've read that that's actually just a myth.

928
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:12,041
Speaker 1: It's yeah.

929
00:58:12,122 --> 00:58:15,060
Speaker 1: If you're immersed, you start to pick it up like that's going to happen.

930
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:16,022
Speaker 0: It's you don't.

931
00:58:16,062 --> 00:58:18,229
Speaker 0: if you it doesn't matter if you have enough life.

932
00:58:18,310 --> 00:58:18,711
Speaker 0: Don't worry.

933
00:58:18,771 --> 00:58:21,480
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're so old, you don't have that much life left to live.

934
00:58:21,600 --> 00:58:23,285
Speaker 0: Maybe, you know, I guess.

935
00:58:23,305 --> 00:58:26,816
Speaker 1: Do you want to spend your baby to do a little lessons a day instead of one?

936
00:58:27,919 --> 00:58:28,160
Speaker 0: Right.

937
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:30,042
Speaker 0: Or faster.

938
00:58:30,062 --> 00:58:30,282
Speaker 0: Yeah.

939
00:58:30,723 --> 00:58:34,709
Speaker 0: But, you know, even at my age, it's like hopefully I have enough life left to live.

940
00:58:35,150 --> 00:58:36,352
Speaker 0: learning on the language.

941
00:58:36,412 --> 00:58:38,195
Speaker 0: It could still be valuable to you.

942
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:41,460
Speaker 0: Don't write it off just because you didn't start early.

943
00:58:43,543 --> 00:58:43,826
Speaker 1: All right.

944
00:58:44,914 --> 00:58:45,459
Speaker 1: See you next week.

945
00:58:47,201 --> 00:58:49,447
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

954
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:47,137
Speaker 1: We talked a little bit about the harmonicas that we both bought and Scott decided to not learn.

955
00:59:47,197 --> 00:59:48,180
Speaker 1: and I decided to learn.

956
00:59:48,720 --> 00:59:52,680
Speaker 1: So I just pulled mine out and I'm just going to play my harmonica really briefly.

957
00:59:52,900 --> 00:59:54,660
Speaker 1: And that's all you're going to get at the end of this episode.
