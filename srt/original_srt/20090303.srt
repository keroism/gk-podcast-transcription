1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,096
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, March 3rd, I'm Rem.

2
00:00:12,277 --> 00:00:12,700
Speaker 1: I'm Sky.

3
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:14,226
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

4
00:00:14,286 --> 00:00:17,040
Speaker 0: Tonight, a little bit of Mouseguard and then Quake Live.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:35,030
Speaker 0: As I said this morning about the weather, I tire of this bullshit.

7
00:00:35,990 --> 00:00:40,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I just, uh... It is so cold.

8
00:00:40,355 --> 00:00:42,463
Speaker 0: I mean, I did the Rochester walk this morning.

9
00:00:42,483 --> 00:00:44,270
Speaker 0: I have not done the Rochester walk in a while.

10
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:46,030
Speaker 0: And I do not want to have to do it again.

11
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:49,145
Speaker 1: I see the thermometer in my car every morning, and this morning it only said -11C.

12
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:52,241
Speaker 1: And there was another time this year where it was less than that.

13
00:00:52,261 --> 00:00:52,643
Speaker 1: It was like -13 or 14C.

14
00:00:54,451 --> 00:00:58,070
Speaker 1: So it wasn't the cold as it's been all year, but it was starting to get warm.

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:00,570
Speaker 1: It was like 40-something degrees for a little while.

16
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:08,670
Speaker 1: So the fact that it got cold again is just like... I'm really not too happy, and I just feel like total shit.

17
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:15,182
Speaker 1: And if it doesn't get spring-sued, I'm just gonna quit and get in a plane, and I'm gonna go buy like a $5,000 house in the desert.

18
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:20,410
Speaker 1: Because, you know, houses are cheap, deserts are warm.

19
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:22,168
Speaker 1: Why would I stay here?

20
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:24,070
Speaker 0: Just quit your job, live off your savings.

21
00:01:24,911 --> 00:01:37,330
Speaker 1: I could just take all my money and I could afford to live in the desert and pay for only an internet connection and electricity and food and own a little desert house and live there for like quite a few years.

22
00:01:37,714 --> 00:01:38,729
Speaker 1: I feel like maybe I should.

23
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:41,110
Speaker 0: You could go one step further and just squat somewhere.

24
00:01:41,733 --> 00:01:44,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to live in a nice desert house.

25
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:46,549
Speaker 0: No, buy a really nice Winnebago.

26
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,610
Speaker 1: Winnebago costs more than a desert shack.

27
00:01:51,111 --> 00:01:53,190
Speaker 0: Fine, buy a really crappy Winnebago.

28
00:01:53,851 --> 00:01:55,229
Speaker 1: Rather, a desert shack is nice.

29
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,174
Speaker 0: I don't know.

30
00:01:56,194 --> 00:01:57,044
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be that nice.

31
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:57,449
Speaker 0: Depends.

32
00:01:58,313 --> 00:01:59,162
Speaker 1: I'd make it myself.

33
00:01:59,182 --> 00:01:59,829
Speaker 1: It'd be very nice.

34
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:04,810
Speaker 0: So you're gonna play Quake on that high-latency satellite internet connection?

35
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:07,157
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

36
00:02:07,197 --> 00:02:10,529
Speaker 1: Because a desert shack is so cheap, I could afford to have a T1 brought out.

37
00:02:12,292 --> 00:02:14,408
Speaker 1: There's telephone pretty much anywhere, so why not?

38
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:17,530
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about the middle of Death Valley.

39
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:20,022
Speaker 1: I'm talking about that tiny little Nevada town or something.

40
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:23,429
Speaker 1: Somewhere between Vegas and Reno.

41
00:02:24,571 --> 00:02:35,870
Speaker 0: But not that long ago, we were at the New York Comic-Con and we did a bunch of stuff there and we have a few things still pending from that, but one thing I did was I talked to Luke Crane a bit about the mouse card role-playing game.

42
00:02:37,176 --> 00:02:38,890
Speaker 0: Now, Mouse Guard, we played it a little bit.

43
00:02:38,930 --> 00:02:44,670
Speaker 0: We're gonna do a show on it once we've fully grokked all that it is and really pushed it to its limits.

44
00:02:45,010 --> 00:02:48,229
Speaker 0: So we're really trying to avoid our commentary on it just yet.

45
00:02:49,691 --> 00:02:57,249
Speaker 1: But yeah, basically, Mouse Guard is a comic book made by David Peterson that I was a huge fan of and had been reading for a very long time.

46
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:02,149
Speaker 1: Luke Crane, you probably know, is the creator of Burning Wheel and I like his RPGs.

47
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:14,787
Speaker 1: And way back, when we did that first Luke Crane interview, right before that interview, like literally one minute before we started that interview, I was sitting in the lobby of, what was that hotel?

48
00:03:16,952 --> 00:03:18,229
Speaker 0: Wherever UberCon was.

49
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:23,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was near the Meadowlands in some hotel at UberCon, whatever number it was.

50
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,090
Speaker 1: And it was me, Luke Crane, Drunken Rim, right?

51
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:28,329
Speaker 0: I wasn't drunk yet.

52
00:03:28,930 --> 00:03:33,310
Speaker 1: No, Tor Olavsrud and these guys from Arcana Studio Press.

53
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:35,670
Speaker 1: And we were sitting there and they were talking.

54
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:39,870
Speaker 1: And once I realized who they were, I was like, oh, because Mouse Guard was brand new back then.

55
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:42,858
Speaker 1: And Scott and I were not... Makes you realize how old Mouse Guard is.

56
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,830
Speaker 1: It's only in its second series.

57
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:48,130
Speaker 0: We were not yet the epic podcasters that we are.

58
00:03:48,472 --> 00:03:48,849
Speaker 1: No, we're not.

59
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,690
Speaker 0: Basically, we had badgered Luke Crane.

60
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,270
Speaker 1: That's where we left the power supply to the compressor.

61
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, the old compressor.

62
00:03:56,450 --> 00:03:58,590
Speaker 0: But we had badgered Luke Crane, this whole con.

63
00:03:58,710 --> 00:03:59,320
Speaker 0: Like, can we interview?

64
00:03:59,361 --> 00:03:59,930
Speaker 0: Can we interview?

65
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:04,510
Speaker 0: And finally, he was like, all right, after the con, you can interview me before I go home.

66
00:04:04,993 --> 00:04:06,910
Speaker 1: No, I think he liked being able to.

67
00:04:07,132 --> 00:04:07,495
Speaker 1: He did.

68
00:04:07,536 --> 00:04:07,819
Speaker 0: He did.

69
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:08,626
Speaker 0: But he was definitely...

70
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:14,390
Speaker 1: And that interview is definitely, you know, he's definitely very pleased with the attention that we have managed to attract for him.

71
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:19,410
Speaker 0: But it was definitely a, we're some punk kids who bothered him to get an interview for something.

72
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:23,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, you know, so that was like the burning empires had just come out.

73
00:04:23,987 --> 00:04:24,510
Speaker 1: then, you know.

74
00:04:24,610 --> 00:04:32,749
Speaker 1: And he was talking to the Arcana Studio Press guys and he was like, hey, Mouse Guard RPG, you know, if, you know, if you guys want me to do it, I'll do it.

75
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,879
Speaker 1: And then, you know, sure enough, here it is.

76
00:04:35,939 --> 00:04:36,762
Speaker 1: How many years later?

77
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:38,126
Speaker 1: There it is.

78
00:04:38,487 --> 00:04:39,029
Speaker 1: Mouse Guard RPG.

79
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:42,420
Speaker 0: But Luke Crane had quite a bit to say about it.

80
00:04:42,501 --> 00:04:44,450
Speaker 0: I recorded this just at the New York Comic Con.

81
00:04:44,591 --> 00:04:48,449
Speaker 0: So there's some background noise, but I'm pretty sure you can understand what he's got to say.

82
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,849
Speaker 2: Hey, Mouse fans.

83
00:04:51,390 --> 00:05:02,410
Speaker 2: Mouse Guard Role Playing Game is a, it's meant to be a simple, instructive role playing game that does not ignore complexity and fighting.

84
00:05:02,972 --> 00:05:09,010
Speaker 2: And the things that we liked about D&D were the things that we ignored about D&D when we played it when we were kids.

85
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:21,770
Speaker 2: The mechanic for the game, I mean, aside from all the color about, you know, what your fur color is and your cloak color and all that cool stuff, the mechanic for the game that really locks it in nice and tight is called nature.

86
00:05:23,372 --> 00:05:29,170
Speaker 2: And your nature determines how mousy you are or how not mousy you are.

87
00:05:29,391 --> 00:05:30,856
Speaker 2: And your nature ranges from zero to seven.

88
00:05:31,317 --> 00:05:34,930
Speaker 2: And the higher your nature is, the better off you are.

89
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,463
Speaker 2: You can power your nature into doing all sorts of things.

90
00:05:37,745 --> 00:05:38,710
Speaker 2: A normal mouse could not.

91
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:43,643
Speaker 2: But if your nature gets too high, you become too mousy, too mouse-like.

92
00:05:43,984 --> 00:05:45,950
Speaker 2: You embody the animal too much, right?

93
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:48,315
Speaker 2: So you can, you know, the wolf will never catch you.

94
00:05:48,355 --> 00:05:49,338
Speaker 2: You'll always outrun the wolf.

95
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:54,050
Speaker 2: You know, you'll always dig your burrow better, but you become too mouse-like.

96
00:05:55,415 --> 00:05:56,298
Speaker 2: And so that gets you a trait.

97
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:57,924
Speaker 2: Basically, your nature hits seven.

98
00:05:58,406 --> 00:05:59,510
Speaker 2: That gets you a crazy mousy trait.

99
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:03,649
Speaker 2: When your nature hits zero, you become too un-mouse-like and you get a trait.

100
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:07,830
Speaker 2: Like, Kelina is the best example, the old dude, you know, the black axe, whatever.

101
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:12,810
Speaker 2: He, at some point in that character's past, he hit nature zero and he retired.

102
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:18,608
Speaker 2: He became un-mouse-like and became kind of, he got the old fur trait, basically, when he hit zero.

103
00:06:19,430 --> 00:06:20,621
Speaker 2: Because he's just like, "Ah, forget it.

104
00:06:20,661 --> 00:06:21,186
Speaker 2: I don't want to do this

105
00:06:21,226 --> 00:06:21,529
Speaker 2: anymore.".

106
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:22,997
Speaker 2: And that's how he's introduced.

107
00:06:23,017 --> 00:06:24,926
Speaker 2: He's like, "I don't want to be in the mouse guard anymore.

108
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:25,549
Speaker 2: I'm something else

109
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:25,670
Speaker 2: now.".

110
00:06:26,613 --> 00:06:28,907
Speaker 2: And we were like, "Wait, how do we make that into a mechanic in the

111
00:06:28,947 --> 00:06:29,148
Speaker 2: game?".

112
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:33,970
Speaker 2: And Kelina, interestingly enough, isn't a sample character because he's the guy you have to play toward.

113
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,736
Speaker 2: You can't make him at the start.

114
00:06:36,017 --> 00:06:38,750
Speaker 2: You have to gun toward playing him and make that history in play.

115
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,633
Speaker 2: Character creation is questionnaire-based.

116
00:06:40,894 --> 00:06:52,970
Speaker 2: You answer questions about your mouse, you know, where he was born, who his parents were, what they did, what his mentor did in the guard, what skills he picked up in the guard, what skills he picked up on the road in the guard, and any kind of natural talents he has.

117
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,658
Speaker 2: And that's pretty much it.

118
00:06:54,678 --> 00:06:55,965
Speaker 2: So that's for your skills.

119
00:06:55,985 --> 00:06:56,850
Speaker 2: And then you do the same thing.

120
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,075
Speaker 2: What traits did your parents have?

121
00:06:58,095 --> 00:06:59,079
Speaker 2: What did you inherit from them?

122
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,625
Speaker 2: What didn't you inherit from them?

123
00:07:00,806 --> 00:07:01,630
Speaker 2: What did you get on your own?

124
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,374
Speaker 2: So it's a questionnaire.

125
00:07:03,495 --> 00:07:08,310
Speaker 2: We try to, like all Burning Wheel games, we try to give you a sense of the history of the character in character creation.

126
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:14,850
Speaker 2: We worked really hard to make sure that the mouse guard game, out of the box, without any effort from the players, plays out the comics.

127
00:07:15,411 --> 00:07:16,673
Speaker 2: Fall and winter, right?

128
00:07:16,714 --> 00:07:24,790
Speaker 2: Where you're scraping and scrapping to survive, you're fighting against insane animals, owls and snakes and badgers.

129
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:33,270
Speaker 2: You're, you know, you're the representatives of this organization on which the safety of all mousekind, you know, rests, right?

130
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,123
Speaker 2: And so there's a lot of pressure and, you know, your missions are all high stakes.

131
00:07:36,384 --> 00:07:37,710
Speaker 2: Your life is always on the line.

132
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:42,350
Speaker 2: When you open that book and you start reading that book, you are going to play a mouse guard story, period.

133
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:50,470
Speaker 2: So one of the ways, one of the mechanics that we built into the game, rather, to reinforce the mousiness of it was something called the natural order.

134
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,202
Speaker 2: And we have this beautiful little chart that David Peterson, the artist and author, designed for us.

135
00:07:56,603 --> 00:08:08,930
Speaker 2: that shows, you know, all the way from insects and, you know, and mice and snakes and bats and birds and badgers and wolves and foxes and bears and moose, like this great scale chart, which honestly is an homage to Call of Cthulhu.

136
00:08:12,110 --> 00:08:14,570
Speaker 2: Anybody who knows what I'm talking about knows what I'm talking about.

137
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:20,270
Speaker 2: And there's that great chart of, like, you go all the way from, like, Bayaki to men all the way up to Cthulhu and they show you the size comparison.

138
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:24,510
Speaker 2: Well, one of the problems in that, for me, is that Cthulhu just has a set number of hit points.

139
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:29,369
Speaker 2: Yeah, he's got special powers, blah, blah, blah, but he's got hit points, which means he can be dealt with.

140
00:08:30,230 --> 00:08:30,872
Speaker 2: Not in mouse guard.

141
00:08:31,112 --> 00:08:38,549
Speaker 2: So you can only affect, like, you can only fight with creatures that are, like, one higher step than you or lower.

142
00:08:39,491 --> 00:08:40,195
Speaker 2: On the natural order.

143
00:08:40,255 --> 00:08:42,525
Speaker 2: So mice can fight with snakes and weasels, right?

144
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,650
Speaker 2: And, you know, and have a chance.

145
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:49,570
Speaker 2: But beyond that, you know, foxes and wolves and bears, mice run.

146
00:08:51,171 --> 00:08:52,254
Speaker 2: That's what you do.

147
00:08:52,335 --> 00:08:56,850
Speaker 2: when you fight a fox or a weasel or whatever, or a fox or rather a wolverine, you run.

148
00:08:59,313 --> 00:09:02,604
Speaker 2: And if you want to confront those creatures, you have to use science.

149
00:09:03,005 --> 00:09:04,510
Speaker 2: You have to use warfare, right?

150
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,139
Speaker 2: No stabby stabby for them.

151
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,247
Speaker 2: You have to use your smarts.

152
00:09:08,011 --> 00:09:17,570
Speaker 2: So by doing this, by creating this natural order and saying this is how it is and these rules are immutable and unbreakable, you know, we've given shape to the universe.

153
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:25,770
Speaker 2: You know, we've planted the poles of the mouse guard world and said, like, okay, this is how they live and this is what they can deal with and this is what they can.

154
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:29,382
Speaker 2: And it just, it immediately sets players' wheels spinning.

155
00:09:29,744 --> 00:09:31,310
Speaker 2: It's really, really effective.

156
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,894
Speaker 2: Animals in mouse guard are animals.

157
00:09:34,696 --> 00:09:36,039
Speaker 2: Mice are special, right?

158
00:09:36,781 --> 00:09:38,264
Speaker 2: They have their foil, right?

159
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:40,730
Speaker 2: You know, mice are special and they have their darker cousin.

160
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:45,550
Speaker 2: They have weasels, which they're not really cousins, but mostelids and rodents are two different things.

161
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:47,093
Speaker 2: I researched all this.

162
00:09:47,574 --> 00:09:54,130
Speaker 2: Anyway, but so, but you basically have your, you know, you have your protagonist peoples and then you have your antagonist peoples.

163
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:55,255
Speaker 2: You have your orcs, right?

164
00:09:55,556 --> 00:09:56,199
Speaker 2: Weasels are the orcs.

165
00:09:56,219 --> 00:09:58,670
Speaker 2: So they're also smart, but they're smart for evil.

166
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:02,418
Speaker 2: But everything else in the mouse guard world are animals.

167
00:10:02,619 --> 00:10:03,842
Speaker 2: They don't have any intelligence.

168
00:10:04,122 --> 00:10:06,027
Speaker 2: They don't have any goals, any aims.

169
00:10:06,047 --> 00:10:07,470
Speaker 2: They have no civilization, no society.

170
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:15,109
Speaker 2: And this creates a great sense of horror when you realize that the raccoon doesn't want to talk to you, it wants to eat you.

171
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,978
Speaker 2: And there's like no amount of negotiation or communication.

172
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:24,870
Speaker 2: Like, you know, a lot of players want to talk to the raccoons and you can, there's a little talk to animal skill.

173
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:26,978
Speaker 2: And that's fine because, you know, we're all animals, whatever.

174
00:10:27,259 --> 00:10:30,190
Speaker 2: But the raccoons pretty much going like, I talked to David Peterson about this.

175
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:36,390
Speaker 2: He was like, I was like, all right, if Liam and the snake from fall, if they could talk, what would the snake be saying?

176
00:10:37,090 --> 00:10:39,308
Speaker 2: And Dave was like, yeah, pretty much be saying, I'm going to eat you.

177
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,270
Speaker 2: So you're like right in the game, the animals don't have stats for negotiation or anything like that.

178
00:10:47,430 --> 00:10:50,441
Speaker 2: Animals have their nature and they obey the laws of their nature period.

179
00:10:50,462 --> 00:10:52,590
Speaker 2: And that's that's because they're animals.

180
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:53,473
Speaker 2: And it's great.

181
00:10:53,895 --> 00:10:57,290
Speaker 2: Weasels are David Peterson's orcs, essentially, for this setting.

182
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:59,238
Speaker 2: They're the generic bad guys.

183
00:10:59,278 --> 00:11:01,670
Speaker 2: But the cool thing is, is that one weasel versus one mouse.

184
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,353
Speaker 2: It's no contest.

185
00:11:03,393 --> 00:11:05,379
Speaker 2: The weasel is a mouse killer, you know.

186
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,610
Speaker 2: And there there's lots of weasels, not as many weasels as mice.

187
00:11:10,271 --> 00:11:14,564
Speaker 2: But there are, you know, they're a genocidal threat to all of mouse kind.

188
00:11:15,025 --> 00:11:16,630
Speaker 2: And so I was OK with them as villains.

189
00:11:16,671 --> 00:11:18,089
Speaker 2: I'm like, OK, these guys are kind of badass.

190
00:11:19,731 --> 00:11:24,629
Speaker 2: So we did a whole like, you know, we started out just about every like weasel we could think of.

191
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,656
Speaker 2: So I think comes to like eight different weasels.

192
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,130
Speaker 2: So but they have stats and skills like mice have stats and skills.

193
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:33,945
Speaker 2: So unlike animals, animals don't have skills, stat skills.

194
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:34,690
Speaker 2: They just have nature.

195
00:11:35,171 --> 00:11:39,950
Speaker 2: If I if I had my druthers, I would want gamer families to play mouse card.

196
00:11:40,731 --> 00:11:47,450
Speaker 2: I want mom or dad to come home to their seven, eight, nine year old kids and be like, all right, we've been waiting.

197
00:11:47,772 --> 00:11:48,658
Speaker 2: We wait for you to get old enough.

198
00:11:48,678 --> 00:11:50,330
Speaker 2: We've been waiting for a game to be good enough.

199
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:51,033
Speaker 2: And here we go.

200
00:11:51,395 --> 00:11:52,722
Speaker 2: You are going to be role playing gamers.

201
00:11:53,044 --> 00:11:54,210
Speaker 2: That would be my ideal.

202
00:11:54,710 --> 00:12:02,170
Speaker 2: As far as I've played, you know, with kids, burning wheel and mouse guard and whatnot, they've never had any trouble rocking the rules.

203
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:05,830
Speaker 2: Only people have trouble rocking the rules for mouse guard or hardcore gamers.

204
00:12:12,701 --> 00:12:14,630
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

205
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:16,600
Speaker 0: We play games a lot.

206
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:23,880
Speaker 0: And the one problem with playing games a lot, like really being into gaming, is that you'll often demystify games for yourself.

207
00:12:24,021 --> 00:12:28,800
Speaker 0: Like I used to be like I used to be very excited when I found glitchy parts of like Simon's Quest.

208
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,876
Speaker 0: Like I find a weird area and I'd be all excited and exploring it.

209
00:12:31,936 --> 00:12:32,740
Speaker 0: It was this crazy thing.

210
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,612
Speaker 0: But now I know exactly why that happens.

211
00:12:35,713 --> 00:12:37,300
Speaker 0: And it's no longer interesting to me.

212
00:12:37,561 --> 00:12:42,540
Speaker 1: I remember one time I think there was a babysitter at my house and I was playing Mega Man two and I was fighting Bubble Man.

213
00:12:42,884 --> 00:12:44,440
Speaker 0: Oh, I remember the Bubble Man story.

214
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:51,860
Speaker 1: And then the door that, you know, I was jumping up to shoot Bubble Man and the door opened and I went backwards and the game totally fucked up.

215
00:12:52,261 --> 00:12:56,400
Speaker 1: So I went back through the door and I was in Bubble Man's room, but everything was screwed up and invisible.

216
00:12:56,480 --> 00:13:00,952
Speaker 1: And I basically messed around in that room to figure out what the fuck.

217
00:13:00,992 --> 00:13:04,020
Speaker 1: I thought I had found some amazing secret for like, you know, a long time.

218
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:04,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

219
00:13:04,422 --> 00:13:06,400
Speaker 0: Didn't you find like every invisible block?

220
00:13:06,881 --> 00:13:06,981
Speaker 1: Yeah.

221
00:13:07,062 --> 00:13:09,012
Speaker 1: It was just, you know, basically it was just a glitch.

222
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:10,680
Speaker 1: It wasn't actually some crazy secret.

223
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:16,360
Speaker 1: But, you know, it was a glitch that happened to appear like a secret, sort of like Metroid only in Metroid.

224
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:23,700
Speaker 1: The glitches become secrets because you glitch them so much that you actually get from one place in the map to another place in the map.

225
00:13:23,901 --> 00:13:24,061
Speaker 0: Yeah.

226
00:13:24,101 --> 00:13:28,380
Speaker 0: Of course, more often than not, you just end up somewhere unsavable and then you die.

227
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:28,961
Speaker 1: Yeah.

228
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:38,520
Speaker 1: Pretty, you know, but people who are good at doing the, you know, the secret, you know, Metroid, you know, glitch jump wall jump tricks, they can pretty much get anywhere they want.

229
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:43,420
Speaker 1: They know where all the spots are and they can like go right to the end of the game and all sorts of shit.

230
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:44,000
Speaker 1: So.

231
00:13:44,661 --> 00:13:54,600
Speaker 0: But anyway, if you want to talk about demystification to the absolute extreme, right here is a website that diagrams everything you could possibly want to know, not just that.

232
00:13:55,081 --> 00:14:01,860
Speaker 0: It diagrams everything about Pac-Man, the exact logic the ghosts use, exactly how they move every single thing.

233
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,420
Speaker 1: Well, that only applies to the original arcade Pac-Man, right?

234
00:14:05,701 --> 00:14:05,942
Speaker 0: Yes.

235
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:10,400
Speaker 1: That doesn't apply to like Pac-Man verse or, you know, any other releases.

236
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,384
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, we don't know.

237
00:14:11,404 --> 00:14:14,060
Speaker 0: We'd have to analyze them in similar detail to find out.

238
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:17,380
Speaker 1: But he's just analyzing the original real deal arcade one, right?

239
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:24,040
Speaker 0: But this is right down to like the speed of Pac-Man and the ghosts and how it changes over time based on how many pellets you've taken.

240
00:14:24,981 --> 00:14:27,600
Speaker 0: The logic the ghosts use to figure out where to go is pretty cool.

241
00:14:27,781 --> 00:14:31,239
Speaker 0: And in case you were a gamer who always suspected but could never prove it.

242
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,171
Speaker 0: Yes, the ghosts did have different personalities.

243
00:14:34,211 --> 00:14:35,959
Speaker 0: They all had completely different logic.

244
00:14:37,860 --> 00:14:41,620
Speaker 0: And because it made sense that the red guy was always coming after you and that sort of thing.

245
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:43,003
Speaker 0: But you can see their paths.

246
00:14:43,064 --> 00:14:49,300
Speaker 0: And the cool thing is what they would always do is every second they would be calculating a spot and they're trying to get to that spot.

247
00:14:49,662 --> 00:14:52,699
Speaker 0: But the spot they're trying to get to is changing all the time based on where Pac-Man is.

248
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:59,100
Speaker 0: So someone made him out of the game where you can see the dots that show where the ghosts are trying to get to.

249
00:14:59,723 --> 00:15:02,240
Speaker 1: That must make it really easy to win because you just...

250
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:08,960
Speaker 0: But remember they're reacting to you in real time so you know where they're trying to get but that dot is jumping all over the place as you move.

251
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:16,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean it still would make it a lot easier to win because you'd know like you'd be going one way and you'd realize you were going to be trapped.

252
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:20,839
Speaker 1: You know sometimes you'd be going down a hallway and like a ghost will look like he's going to hit you.

253
00:15:21,240 --> 00:15:24,740
Speaker 1: So you turn around and you end up dying but actually that ghost turned a different way.

254
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,020
Speaker 1: You know and you could have made it if you would have gone that way.

255
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:30,840
Speaker 0: If you read this you can figure out which ghost is almost always going to turn away.

256
00:15:31,460 --> 00:15:32,600
Speaker 1: Oh, that's good stuff.

257
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:33,519
Speaker 1: It is good stuff.

258
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,232
Speaker 1: Yeah the thing is even so.

259
00:15:35,252 --> 00:15:36,280
Speaker 1: you'd have to think fast.

260
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:41,320
Speaker 1: You'd have to be like orange ghost keep going or blue ghost turn around and you know that kind of stuff.

261
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,758
Speaker 0: But it's interesting that a game that appears so simple when you play it.

262
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,914
Speaker 0: And a lot of times people will think it's very random because they don't understand how games work.

263
00:15:50,954 --> 00:15:52,680
Speaker 0: or they're not good at them or they're a kid or something.

264
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:57,460
Speaker 0: But the game as simple as it is had a lot of really interesting emergent behavior that appeared.

265
00:15:58,101 --> 00:16:03,500
Speaker 0: But if you actually analyze it fully it's all still completely 100 percent deterministic.

266
00:16:03,981 --> 00:16:05,166
Speaker 1: No, well it's a computer.

267
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:08,420
Speaker 1: It can't be non-deterministic unless it's broken.

268
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:12,540
Speaker 0: Well I mean you could use random numbers to see behavior and that sort of thing.

269
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,951
Speaker 1: Yes but the random numbers are deterministic.

270
00:16:15,032 --> 00:16:16,700
Speaker 1: They're not real random numbers.

271
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:17,999
Speaker 0: Well Scott what if you used a true...

272
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,600
Speaker 1: Especially not in a weak ass old arcade machine.

273
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:25,660
Speaker 0: What if you used a true or semi-true random number generator like say a thermal delta switch.

274
00:16:26,442 --> 00:16:27,720
Speaker 1: Well you know that's a different story.

275
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:37,700
Speaker 1: But that would create possibly... You could actually... That would be really interesting if you had a true random number generator or something like that and you used it in some sort of game.

276
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:40,480
Speaker 1: You could perhaps make a game that is unwinnable.

277
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:44,320
Speaker 0: Well it's not that hard to make a game that's unwinnable.

278
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,720
Speaker 0: Mario starts, there's no floor.

279
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:48,178
Speaker 0: That's it.

280
00:16:49,741 --> 00:16:53,820
Speaker 1: I mean you know an interesting unwinnable game.

281
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,278
Speaker 0: So it's like that cat Mario mod game.

282
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:01,176
Speaker 1: Basically it would be a game where there is no optimal strategy because you're going against true randomness.

283
00:17:01,257 --> 00:17:01,819
Speaker 1: but you know...

284
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,387
Speaker 0: But Scott you can effectively get true randomness.

285
00:17:04,489 --> 00:17:06,214
Speaker 0: I say effectively with dice.

286
00:17:06,757 --> 00:17:07,440
Speaker 0: We have that.

287
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:09,260
Speaker 1: Yeah dice are pretty random.

288
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,079
Speaker 0: Actually you know in World War II how they generated one-time pads in Britain for the military to use?

289
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:19,619
Speaker 0: Old ladies rolling bingo things basically.

290
00:17:19,859 --> 00:17:20,400
Speaker 1: Oh bingo balls?

291
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:21,579
Speaker 1: No that's not bad.

292
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:25,880
Speaker 0: They'd roll something, pull out a number, write the number down, roll something, pull out another number, write the number down.

293
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:26,537
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

294
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,079
Speaker 1: Yeah.

295
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:27,692
Speaker 1: That works.

296
00:17:29,302 --> 00:17:30,459
Speaker 0: So do you have a thing of the day?

297
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:31,535
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah.

298
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,720
Speaker 1: So I was poking around looking at you know game engines right?

299
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,740
Speaker 1: Because you know I was talking like water is poison.

300
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,540
Speaker 1: We're like hey let's make like a Half-Life mod.

301
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,540
Speaker 1: All these punk kids do it.

302
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:42,318
Speaker 1: We can do it too right?

303
00:17:42,460 --> 00:17:43,120
Speaker 1: We're professionals.

304
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:48,900
Speaker 1: And of course there's a long story behind that but that wasn't going to work out.

305
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:53,556
Speaker 1: So I started poking around and I'm like there has to be some sort of open source game engine.

306
00:17:53,576 --> 00:17:54,600
Speaker 1: that's all awesome like.

307
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,040
Speaker 0: Well see I was about to say there are plenty but then you just said awesome.

308
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:58,928
Speaker 1: Yeah.

309
00:17:59,881 --> 00:18:04,620
Speaker 1: So every game engine out there seems to either be limited, not awesome.

310
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:06,860
Speaker 1: I mean there's zillions of them out there right?

311
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,440
Speaker 1: But they're either crap, limited, cost money.

312
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,560
Speaker 1: Pretty much all of them are flawed in some way.

313
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,979
Speaker 1: They're in a bad language that no one wants to use.

314
00:18:15,449 --> 00:18:15,738
Speaker 1: You know?

315
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:19,440
Speaker 1: Like there's one that's actually kind of okay called Joker, J Ogre.

316
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,360
Speaker 1: It's a Java thing that like gives you a pretty standard.

317
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:23,104
Speaker 0: Java.

318
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,940
Speaker 1: Yeah it gives you a pretty standard MVC framework for you know making sort of simple multiplayer games.

319
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:33,120
Speaker 1: Like if you want to make board games like this handles like already you don't have to do any work.

320
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:34,163
Speaker 1: It does like.

321
00:18:34,464 --> 00:18:37,660
Speaker 1: you know the lobbies and the joining and the whole thing and it just works.

322
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,239
Speaker 1: I tried it.

323
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:38,736
Speaker 1: It totally works.

324
00:18:39,422 --> 00:18:43,860
Speaker 1: But the thing is you can't make anything that looks nice because it's all swing gooeys.

325
00:18:44,282 --> 00:18:50,277
Speaker 1: So you'd have to basically do a whole shit ton of work to make anything that looks cool or it just looks like you know Java gooeys.

326
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:56,800
Speaker 1: But anyway in the course of that I found this thing called love right?

327
00:18:57,449 --> 00:18:57,620
Speaker 0: And that.

328
00:18:59,007 --> 00:18:59,760
Speaker 0: You found love.

329
00:19:00,261 --> 00:19:05,520
Speaker 1: Not love as in the emotion but love as in the game engine called love.

330
00:19:05,882 --> 00:19:09,035
Speaker 1: And love the game engine isn't really.

331
00:19:09,276 --> 00:19:10,340
Speaker 1: it's pretty limited right?

332
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,860
Speaker 1: It falls into the limited category.

333
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:14,900
Speaker 1: You can't make a multiplayer game with this right?

334
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:15,824
Speaker 1: You can't make.

335
00:19:16,306 --> 00:19:19,199
Speaker 1: you know a lot of you can't make like really fancy games with this.

336
00:19:19,782 --> 00:19:24,700
Speaker 1: But what it is is you can make games using a language called Lua.

337
00:19:24,861 --> 00:19:25,295
Speaker 1: L-U-A.

338
00:19:26,381 --> 00:19:30,940
Speaker 1: And for people who don't know Lua is like this really sort of simple programming language.

339
00:19:31,061 --> 00:19:35,080
Speaker 1: And a lot of like a lot of things will use it as the configuration.

340
00:19:35,301 --> 00:19:39,912
Speaker 1: Like if you use lighty the web server like all the configuration files are written in Lua.

341
00:19:40,201 --> 00:19:43,679
Speaker 1: So it's it's meant to be very human readable and very easy to do.

342
00:19:44,501 --> 00:19:50,700
Speaker 1: And if you use love you can very easily make sort of simple 2D games.

343
00:19:50,941 --> 00:19:51,303
Speaker 1: You know like.

344
00:19:51,343 --> 00:19:58,757
Speaker 1: if you want to make you know something like you know just something one of those like little indie demo kind of things like something like passage.

345
00:19:58,777 --> 00:19:59,908
Speaker 1: you can make passage in love.

346
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:04,538
Speaker 1: You could make what's the one with the chandelier and the.

347
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:07,080
Speaker 0: I have no idea what you're talking about.

348
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,980
Speaker 1: Remember the one where you drop the chandelier and the monster.

349
00:20:09,323 --> 00:20:10,639
Speaker 1: It's just it's just to fight the boss.

350
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,880
Speaker 1: There was like the little quirky little indie game.

351
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,000
Speaker 0: I remember it vaguely.

352
00:20:15,442 --> 00:20:15,695
Speaker 1: Yeah.

353
00:20:16,681 --> 00:20:17,726
Speaker 1: But anyway you can make that.

354
00:20:17,907 --> 00:20:18,992
Speaker 1: you know anything like that.

355
00:20:19,032 --> 00:20:22,159
Speaker 1: you know a cute small game you can make in love really really easy.

356
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:25,080
Speaker 0: So when are we going to see the first Scott production.

357
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:25,877
Speaker 1: I don't know.

358
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:39,240
Speaker 1: But the point is is that if you have a get an idea for some like sort of cute little 2D game you could crack you could smack that thing out in love and like you know less than a day like pretty easily depending on how you know real quick.

359
00:20:40,241 --> 00:20:48,497
Speaker 1: So you know if someone wants to make like a platform game that's like you know just one screen something like line right or you could probably make you know anything along those lines.

360
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,900
Speaker 1: You can probably make a tower defense but it'd be it'd be a little difficult.

361
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:52,320
Speaker 0: I don't know.

362
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:53,420
Speaker 0: Tower Defense right.

363
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:57,640
Speaker 0: It seems like it had this high rise and I feel like it's a dying genre already.

364
00:20:58,401 --> 00:21:05,699
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean I played like the last 10 that I've seen just briefly and they were all like exactly the same if not worse.

365
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,526
Speaker 1: Well you know it's pretty much.

366
00:21:07,587 --> 00:21:12,999
Speaker 1: they sort of try to differentiate themselves by changing superficial things without changing any fundamental things.

367
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,839
Speaker 0: Yeah so you shoot like a zombie or you shoot.

368
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:17,463
Speaker 1: Well it's like that.

369
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:37,737
Speaker 1: some of them are like OK you can upgrade these things with gems and another one is like OK you can combine the gems together and another one is like all right you don't actually upgrade anything you just put towers next to each other and which towers are adjacent to each other determines changes the towers themselves and they do stuff like that.

370
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:46,580
Speaker 0: Maybe I think that's part of the reason why I like the old desktop tower defense so much was that it kind of did away with scanning and theme really and it was just a tower defense.

371
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,499
Speaker 1: The theme was it's your desk.

372
00:21:48,881 --> 00:21:52,440
Speaker 0: But none of the things made much sense in that regard.

373
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,780
Speaker 1: There were things you were drawing on your desk with a pencil.

374
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,238
Speaker 0: That was the theme?

375
00:21:56,861 --> 00:21:58,440
Speaker 1: You can see it's desktop tower defense.

376
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,059
Speaker 1: The background is a desk.

377
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:03,180
Speaker 0: But the structures were basically just little blobs.

378
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:04,660
Speaker 1: Well that's what you're doodling.

379
00:22:05,121 --> 00:22:06,580
Speaker 0: OK yeah that's kind of weak.

380
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:09,151
Speaker 1: Well that's that's the theme of desktop tower defense.

381
00:22:09,211 --> 00:22:10,920
Speaker 1: it's literally desktop tower defense.

382
00:22:11,241 --> 00:22:14,940
Speaker 0: But what I'm saying is that the theme was like barely there and didn't affect the game.

383
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,345
Speaker 1: You're talking about.

384
00:22:15,365 --> 00:22:16,619
Speaker 1: the theme was incredibly strong.

385
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,158
Speaker 1: It's everything's drawn all pencil-y right.

386
00:22:20,384 --> 00:22:22,440
Speaker 1: The background is a picture of the top of a desk.

387
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,849
Speaker 0: OK so it had a background.

388
00:22:23,889 --> 00:22:25,340
Speaker 0: the rest it wasn't really drawn sketchily.

389
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,618
Speaker 0: Do I have to pull up screenshots of it again?

390
00:22:27,061 --> 00:22:27,719
Speaker 1: Go look at it.

391
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,276
Speaker 1: You'll see it.

392
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:29,739
Speaker 1: I can't believe you didn't know this.

393
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:31,634
Speaker 1: This is like it was obvious for the moment.

394
00:22:31,674 --> 00:22:32,339
Speaker 1: I first played it.

395
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,440
Speaker 1: The theme is very strong anyway.

396
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,419
Speaker 0: Alright I argue that the theme is weak but we digress.

397
00:22:39,141 --> 00:22:42,360
Speaker 1: Anyway so yeah if you want to make a little tiny game you can you can get some love.

398
00:22:43,186 --> 00:22:45,080
Speaker 1: It's free and open source and all that and whatnot.

399
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:50,820
Speaker 0: So for the last many years there's been this kind of FPS's event in a state.

400
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:58,700
Speaker 0: You hear us complain about FPS's all the time but just recently this gigantic monolith has been dropped amidst the Halo players.

401
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:05,024
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean basically what happened is you know there were FPS's were pretty much all in software.

402
00:23:05,064 --> 00:23:09,280
Speaker 1: you know is Wolfenstein, Doom, Doom, Quake, Quake, Quake, Quake right.

403
00:23:11,484 --> 00:23:13,294
Speaker 1: And that was what the FPS was.

404
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,620
Speaker 1: And then you know other FPS's came around.

405
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:20,220
Speaker 1: You had the GoldenEye, Half-Life, and Halo were pretty much like the big three.

406
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,860
Speaker 1: That sort of an unreal tournament not so much.

407
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,300
Speaker 1: It was sort of off to the side.

408
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,620
Speaker 1: It was always like a second fiddle.

409
00:23:28,081 --> 00:23:30,300
Speaker 1: But those three came along and sort of changed FPS's.

410
00:23:30,921 --> 00:23:32,260
Speaker 1: You know Counter-Strike especially.

411
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,191
Speaker 1: You know it's like okay no more of the.

412
00:23:34,533 --> 00:23:35,560
Speaker 1: you know deathmatch.

413
00:23:36,143 --> 00:23:39,520
Speaker 1: No more of the really fast Twitch gameplay.

414
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:41,039
Speaker 1: Now we're going to have a slow game.

415
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:46,520
Speaker 1: You know it's all about being slow and crafty and it's all you got to reload your weapons.

416
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,140
Speaker 1: You know and it's not about Twitch.

417
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:53,080
Speaker 1: It's about which path you're taking and can you aim and all that sort of stuff.

418
00:23:53,320 --> 00:23:55,200
Speaker 0: Well I would argue more that it's much simpler than that.

419
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:58,960
Speaker 0: It was just that consoles became the primary means of gameplay.

420
00:23:59,280 --> 00:24:00,360
Speaker 1: Well that was later though.

421
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:04,760
Speaker 1: I mean I think that the old school FPS died before the console.

422
00:24:05,122 --> 00:24:08,239
Speaker 1: You know because Counter-Strike was there for a few years.

423
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:11,940
Speaker 1: You know killing off Quake before Halo came along.

424
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:14,280
Speaker 0: But at the same time Counter-Strike is still pretty old school.

425
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,939
Speaker 0: I mean it's still a difficult awesome FPS.

426
00:24:18,143 --> 00:24:22,840
Speaker 0: If you don't have the raw aiming and maneuvering FPS skills you can't play Counter-Strike.

427
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,615
Speaker 1: That's true.

428
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,080
Speaker 1: But I guess Counter-Strike is sort of the in between.

429
00:24:26,760 --> 00:24:28,780
Speaker 1: It's sort of like you know but it's definitely not.

430
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,540
Speaker 1: It's not Quake.

431
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:30,920
Speaker 1: It's not the same.

432
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,000
Speaker 1: It's not old school.

433
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:34,179
Speaker 1: It's semi old school.

434
00:24:34,301 --> 00:24:35,320
Speaker 0: I don't know it's not that.

435
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:43,739
Speaker 0: I mean the only difference between it and say like action Quake team play was that action Quake team play was well I don't know three or four times faster.

436
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:44,760
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

437
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,046
Speaker 1: The speed makes it.

438
00:24:46,147 --> 00:24:47,192
Speaker 1: you know it's just what you think.

439
00:24:47,212 --> 00:24:48,560
Speaker 1: it's just one factor the speed.

440
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,700
Speaker 1: But no that one factor makes like this entire world of difference.

441
00:24:51,720 --> 00:25:03,869
Speaker 0: But just to simplify there was this combination of one consoles which have very weak controls compared to a PC for FPS's and two this drive toward realism and trying to make games FPS's at least very realistic and gritty.

442
00:25:03,929 --> 00:25:09,360
Speaker 0: and the more realistic you make an FPS it's kind of like the difference between Soul Calibur and Bushido Blade.

443
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,678
Speaker 0: Bushido Blade's a lot more realistic in one regard but it makes it a completely different game as a result.

444
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:14,639
Speaker 1: Bad game.

445
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:19,059
Speaker 0: And for a long time we really wanted to bring back the old school FPS's.

446
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:22,099
Speaker 0: I mean I love natural selection and it's doing okay.

447
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,920
Speaker 0: I mean the community is still pretty strong.

448
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:28,500
Speaker 0: And I love tribes too but there's just no way to make the tribes 2 community come back again.

449
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,060
Speaker 0: It's just impossible.

450
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,969
Speaker 1: I mean they they're trying recently.

451
00:25:31,009 --> 00:25:33,683
Speaker 1: they do it like the tribes revival or whatever but it's not.

452
00:25:34,187 --> 00:25:36,060
Speaker 1: it's not coming on as strong as it needs to.

453
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:46,137
Speaker 1: And the major problem there is that tribes is a game that needs you know servers that have like 40 people on them and you know it's just a game that doesn't work unless a shit ton of people are playing it.

454
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:55,269
Speaker 1: So basically we're sitting here and we got some FPS's to play but we're missing the old school flavor and it's sort of like.

455
00:25:55,289 --> 00:25:59,684
Speaker 1: you know you have this genre FPS and within the genre there are flavors.

456
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:14,812
Speaker 1: you know the slow tactical and the the military and the the team based one with vehicles right and you got all these you know sub-genres but the sub-genre of really fast twitch just fucking kill.

457
00:26:14,912 --> 00:26:16,780
Speaker 1: everyone sort of died out.

458
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:20,980
Speaker 1: I mean there was Quake 4 but no one who plays Quake 4.

459
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,920
Speaker 0: No one plays Quake 4.

460
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,300
Speaker 1: No one plays Quake 4 right.

461
00:26:23,761 --> 00:26:28,675
Speaker 1: So much to our surprise right Quake Live comes.

462
00:26:29,356 --> 00:26:30,078
Speaker 1: you know it's been.

463
00:26:30,118 --> 00:26:33,854
Speaker 1: it's been around for you know a while but the beta opened up like a week ago.

464
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:35,180
Speaker 1: I think something like that.

465
00:26:35,441 --> 00:26:36,224
Speaker 1: not too long ago.

466
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:40,097
Speaker 1: the Quake Live beta opened up and I was you know I was curious.

467
00:26:40,739 --> 00:26:43,493
Speaker 1: so we go in and it's like okay Quake in the web browser.

468
00:26:43,553 --> 00:26:44,177
Speaker 1: what's you know?

469
00:26:44,217 --> 00:26:44,599
Speaker 1: what are they?

470
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:45,557
Speaker 1: what are they going to do here.

471
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:46,624
Speaker 0: And it's not even.

472
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:48,172
Speaker 0: I mean you can't say it's a web plug.

473
00:26:48,213 --> 00:26:53,780
Speaker 0: it's basically just you download Quake and then it interfaces through the web browser to like set up your game.

474
00:26:53,960 --> 00:27:02,258
Speaker 1: Yeah basically instead of installing Quake as its own application it's just installs as a browser plug-in but you're still just installing Quake it's not you know?

475
00:27:02,579 --> 00:27:11,180
Speaker 1: I mean you can if you want to keep the quake window inside your browser window thus making it really hard to see instead of playing full screen.

476
00:27:11,861 --> 00:27:14,590
Speaker 0: Now the end result is that this is brilliant.

477
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:22,844
Speaker 0: I mean it's Quake 3. it's an old game and they brought it back in this capacity but all they've really done is solved the problem I've been having for years of.

478
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:24,590
Speaker 0: I like old school FPSs.

479
00:27:24,651 --> 00:27:25,935
Speaker 0: I like difficult FPSs.

480
00:27:26,377 --> 00:27:37,279
Speaker 0: I want other people to play these FPSs but those games are so inaccessible and even if they are accessible as a game on the meta perspective there's no way to get a game of it going.

481
00:27:37,299 --> 00:27:45,460
Speaker 0: do you know how hard it is to like get a bunch of Halo kids to download Quake 3 install it connect to my server with an IP address and then play a deathmatch.

482
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:46,204
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean people.

483
00:27:46,224 --> 00:27:51,512
Speaker 1: you know you're used to playing Halo and you're used to playing games on Steam right where you have sort of easy it's.

484
00:27:51,552 --> 00:27:56,495
Speaker 1: you know there's a list of servers and you just click on one and you're playing and they handle that for you.

485
00:27:56,736 --> 00:28:06,667
Speaker 1: you don't realize that Quake 1, 2, 3 all those old games even Quake 3 there was no really good server match up thing.

486
00:28:06,687 --> 00:28:07,920
Speaker 1: there was no list of servers.

487
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:12,211
Speaker 0: I used to have literally this text file I saved to my desktop and it listed all the.

488
00:28:17,321 --> 00:28:22,903
Speaker 1: Yeah people would use things like you know GameSpy and Kali in order to you know get server lists.

489
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:26,700
Speaker 1: it was sort of like they would have separate programs to list the servers.

490
00:28:27,022 --> 00:28:30,520
Speaker 1: then they would double click on one in the list and I would launch the game separately.

491
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,598
Speaker 0: Well if you were smart you just use the CLQ.

492
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,365
Speaker 1: Yes but you know you get.

493
00:28:34,385 --> 00:28:38,502
Speaker 1: my point is that it wasn't easy to get a game of these things going.

494
00:28:38,642 --> 00:28:43,844
Speaker 1: you know you had to find a server you had to be in the know it was and normal people couldn't do it.

495
00:28:43,904 --> 00:28:46,901
Speaker 1: I mean normal people could go to the store buy Quake 3 install it and play.

496
00:28:46,921 --> 00:28:49,290
Speaker 1: they get a LAN game going on pretty easily.

497
00:28:49,611 --> 00:28:53,779
Speaker 1: but to play an internet game required you know effort now extra effort.

498
00:28:54,160 --> 00:29:02,478
Speaker 0: For a long time up to this point there have been a lot of arguments all over the internet I won't say our forums because it's everywhere people like us who play these old FPS's.

499
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:05,473
Speaker 0: and then kids who say yeah they're not so different they're not so hard.

500
00:29:05,654 --> 00:29:22,680
Speaker 0: my games are fine Halo's great and I mean those games are good games but they never really seem to understand just how difficult these old games are and how difficult it is to be good at them and not even good how difficult it is to kill a single person.

501
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:30,059
Speaker 1: How difficult it is to get a weapon even though they're lying around all over the place and how difficult it is to not get killed.

502
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,450
Speaker 0: Let alone how fast they go.

503
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,178
Speaker 0: and Quake 3 is not even the fastest.

504
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:36,365
Speaker 0: Quake 3 is slow it's just.

505
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:38,694
Speaker 0: we're never gonna get Quake 2 back.

506
00:29:39,256 --> 00:29:42,087
Speaker 0: I've given up on playing like Mega TF with people again.

507
00:29:42,107 --> 00:29:45,240
Speaker 0: yeah I think those games they're dinosaurs they're extinct.

508
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:45,640
Speaker 0: I admit that.

509
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:56,704
Speaker 1: When you kids go to play Quake Live and you see how fast it is right remember that that was actually when Quake 3 came out everyone who had played Quake 1 and 2 was like wow why is Quake 3 all slow?

510
00:29:56,724 --> 00:30:00,394
Speaker 1: and so Quake Live is Quake 3 it's slow.

511
00:30:00,815 --> 00:30:05,929
Speaker 1: Quake 1 and 2 are crazy fast like well correct speed.

512
00:30:07,153 --> 00:30:08,638
Speaker 1: Quake 3 is slow but yeah.

513
00:30:09,481 --> 00:30:21,816
Speaker 0: This has finally been solved because all over the internet now we have seen people Halo kids modern FPSers posting in forums and saying things to the effect of what the fuck I can't get any kills what's going on.

514
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:33,588
Speaker 1: Yeah and the thing I sort of realized you know because I haven't played you know Quake like for more than five minutes in a very long time is that you know how simple the game is compared to a lot of other FPS is.

515
00:30:33,628 --> 00:30:36,941
Speaker 1: I mean not even tribes 2 or NS but say Counter Strike.

516
00:30:36,981 --> 00:30:42,941
Speaker 1: right and Counter Strike you've got buy menus you've got reload you've got crouch right.

517
00:30:43,122 --> 00:30:44,265
Speaker 1: you know what Quake has.

518
00:30:44,606 --> 00:30:49,979
Speaker 1: it's got change weapon shoot jump move and zoom in.

519
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:51,325
Speaker 1: that's pretty much all it has.

520
00:30:51,385 --> 00:30:53,234
Speaker 0: yeah I mean those are all the controls.

521
00:30:53,274 --> 00:30:58,232
Speaker 1: there are a couple of items but yeah there's a use button that you that you push.

522
00:30:58,272 --> 00:31:04,975
Speaker 0: maybe like once a century you don't even have to click anything to open doors doors just open.

523
00:31:05,156 --> 00:31:09,291
Speaker 1: yeah there is literally like the controls are so primitive.

524
00:31:09,351 --> 00:31:10,938
Speaker 1: I mean I guess oh you move the mouse to aim.

525
00:31:10,978 --> 00:31:12,543
Speaker 1: of course right but that's it.

526
00:31:12,724 --> 00:31:20,251
Speaker 1: that's all the controls of Quake 3. yet the game is so incredibly difficult compared to games with other controls.

527
00:31:20,291 --> 00:31:20,412
Speaker 1: like.

528
00:31:20,432 --> 00:31:33,392
Speaker 1: you can learn how to play in like a minute you know because the controls are so few but if you play against anyone who knows what they're doing at all you're just going to get killed instantly because the game is so fast and requires such reflexes and such.

529
00:31:33,713 --> 00:31:33,914
Speaker 1: you know.

530
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:39,098
Speaker 1: I guess this is a little bit of learning curve and learning what all the weapons do and learning what all the items do.

531
00:31:39,118 --> 00:31:45,372
Speaker 1: you know like you got to know that green health lets you go above a hundred and yellow health doesn't and red armor is better than yellow armor.

532
00:31:45,392 --> 00:31:47,883
Speaker 0: yeah the thing is you don't even need to know that stuff too well.

533
00:31:47,924 --> 00:31:53,363
Speaker 0: you're pretty much just have to be able to move shoot and react quickly to things.

534
00:31:53,905 --> 00:31:57,983
Speaker 1: yeah that'll that'll get you you know far enough to actually pick up some of these items.

535
00:31:58,204 --> 00:31:59,811
Speaker 0: yeah but I mean I think like it.

536
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:06,016
Speaker 0: this made me though playing this again because I'd played Quake 3 and Quake 2 and all these games recently a whole bunch.

537
00:32:06,076 --> 00:32:19,228
Speaker 0: but now that I'm playing them for real with other people on a regular basis I mean I have played Quake almost every day for the past week for like hours and I'm starting to remember all the things about all these old FPS.

538
00:32:19,248 --> 00:32:20,533
Speaker 0: is that just don't happen anymore?

539
00:32:20,613 --> 00:32:21,437
Speaker 0: like the?

540
00:32:21,537 --> 00:32:26,271
Speaker 0: the precision required to aim is ludicrous for most kids.

541
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:28,117
Speaker 1: now I mean this is the railgun.

542
00:32:28,177 --> 00:32:31,369
Speaker 1: right the railgun pretty much kills most people in one hit.

543
00:32:31,469 --> 00:32:35,165
Speaker 1: if you hit them in the head yeah I mean it's it's really dangerous.

544
00:32:35,226 --> 00:32:40,795
Speaker 1: I mean and the thing is most of the people you're fighting are you know it's rare that you come across someone with full health right.

545
00:32:41,077 --> 00:32:45,877
Speaker 1: so if you hit them with it they're probably gonna die right and it actually goes through people.

546
00:32:45,917 --> 00:32:51,244
Speaker 1: so if everyone lines up and you shoot it you can shoot it straight through them and kill like three or four people in one shot.

547
00:32:52,168 --> 00:32:55,258
Speaker 1: you have to pretty much aim exactly on them you know.

548
00:32:55,339 --> 00:33:00,421
Speaker 1: or it's a laser that pretty much as soon as you push the button it fires and that one spot and that's it.

549
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:06,818
Speaker 1: it's a railgun yeah and it's really really hard to hit anyone with it.

550
00:33:07,119 --> 00:33:16,466
Speaker 0: if they're unless they're standing still like a doofus plus if you're playing a duel I mean these guys are moving three or four times faster than like Team Fortress and they're further away and the spaces are bigger.

551
00:33:17,168 --> 00:33:22,891
Speaker 0: and if it's a full health like duel you've got to hit him in the head yeah his tiny little head.

552
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:26,748
Speaker 1: and if it's a duel right and there's less people on the map right.

553
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:31,408
Speaker 1: so if it's like a 16 player deathmatch all right everyone's running around getting shot at constantly.

554
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:39,519
Speaker 1: if it's a duel one-on-one people have time to go around and get armor and get all kinds of weapons before you bump into them.

555
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:43,621
Speaker 0: right unless you play one of the old school duel maps but none of those seem to be in here yet.

556
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:43,942
Speaker 0: yeah.

557
00:33:44,363 --> 00:33:53,436
Speaker 1: so if they got time to go run around and grab all this stuff by the time you meet them you're gonna need to hit them a whole lot before they hit you a whole lot.

558
00:33:54,119 --> 00:33:55,929
Speaker 0: of course you should have picked all this stuff up too.

559
00:33:56,231 --> 00:33:58,002
Speaker 1: yeah but you know there's only one red arm.

560
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,817
Speaker 1: so if one guy gets the red you're probably only gonna get the yellow now.

561
00:34:00,837 --> 00:34:02,970
Speaker 0: you can avoid him until it comes and you can grab it too.

562
00:34:03,071 --> 00:34:08,563
Speaker 0: I guess you know depending on the map and such plus if you're playing one-on-one you should be playing on a duel map where that's all taken care of.

563
00:34:08,905 --> 00:34:09,748
Speaker 1: yeah that's true.

564
00:34:09,809 --> 00:34:11,215
Speaker 1: also you know if it's a good duel map.

565
00:34:11,777 --> 00:34:13,123
Speaker 1: I haven't actually played any duels.

566
00:34:13,184 --> 00:34:14,772
Speaker 1: I've been mostly playing deathmatches.

567
00:34:15,234 --> 00:34:15,775
Speaker 0: yeah there's.

568
00:34:15,897 --> 00:34:18,447
Speaker 0: there's just some sort of visceral fun about a death.

569
00:34:18,467 --> 00:34:20,618
Speaker 0: I mean I forgot almost actually won one.

570
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:22,646
Speaker 0: it was crazy about this time in my life.

571
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:26,902
Speaker 0: I've won like 10. it's not that of course I've played more than you.

572
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:27,505
Speaker 1: I only won.

573
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,150
Speaker 1: I almost won one just now.

574
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:30,175
Speaker 1: I was down by like two.

575
00:34:30,195 --> 00:34:30,676
Speaker 0: it's amazing.

576
00:34:30,697 --> 00:34:39,139
Speaker 0: you see the skill cab difference in a game like team fortress where once you get good enough like no one can be better than you because everyone's pretty much at this equal level.

577
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:43,373
Speaker 0: but in quake you'll see someone where five minutes have gone by.

578
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:52,931
Speaker 0: they've got 40 frags the next person out of them has 39 person out of them has seven then there's a whole bunch of sevens and then everyone else has like negative two.

579
00:34:53,694 --> 00:34:57,191
Speaker 1: yeah I mean you can always sort of tell if someone's really good.

580
00:34:57,231 --> 00:34:59,443
Speaker 1: I mean like if there's someone on the server who's really good.

581
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:04,184
Speaker 1: right they're just gonna win because they'll get the rail gunning and hit everyone with every single shot.

582
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:04,485
Speaker 1: right.

583
00:35:05,267 --> 00:35:10,989
Speaker 1: but if everyone's sort of equal I remember the game really comes down to the fight over the quad damage.

584
00:35:11,009 --> 00:35:21,134
Speaker 1: because you get the quad damage then that gives you the the upper hand you know for like about 30 seconds to hose enough people down to get like five or six frags and that's what's gonna give you the win.

585
00:35:21,294 --> 00:35:21,696
Speaker 0: but I'm just.

586
00:35:21,736 --> 00:35:26,231
Speaker 0: I'm having such visceral simple fun from playing an FPS.

587
00:35:26,251 --> 00:35:26,653
Speaker 0: we're all.

588
00:35:26,693 --> 00:35:27,916
Speaker 0: it's a it's a deathmatch.

589
00:35:28,277 --> 00:35:31,249
Speaker 0: deathmatch is almost gone and now it's back a straight-up deathmatch.

590
00:35:31,370 --> 00:35:34,643
Speaker 1: yeah all they had to do right was they took the same exact game.

591
00:35:34,683 --> 00:35:35,806
Speaker 1: they barely changed it.

592
00:35:35,847 --> 00:35:42,569
Speaker 1: they sort of it's just pure quake right and they made it so that you can get at it easily.

593
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:46,763
Speaker 1: you don't need IP addresses you don't need any sort of funky user interface right.

594
00:35:47,024 --> 00:35:55,954
Speaker 1: they put all the server matchups and all the you know user profiles and all the friend system and the whole thing in the web browser.

595
00:35:56,336 --> 00:36:02,901
Speaker 1: and then as soon as you click you know join game it opens up and goes full screen or whatever with the plug-in and that's that's it.

596
00:36:03,422 --> 00:36:07,291
Speaker 0: it's a game where you're trying to get frags and not get gibbed.

597
00:36:08,173 --> 00:36:26,319
Speaker 0: yep though honestly the best thing I haven't been able to play FPS is like this for a long time but you know back in the day like playing in clans and being really like into this sort of thing and like practicing and these are FPS is where if you want to be good you've got to sit down with people and practice.

598
00:36:27,162 --> 00:36:29,049
Speaker 0: let me do like shooting drill.

599
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:34,449
Speaker 1: yeah well look at a dude like fatality right that dude freaking practiced like almost all day every day.

600
00:36:34,469 --> 00:36:34,971
Speaker 1: you know.

601
00:36:35,011 --> 00:36:36,899
Speaker 1: he like he like trained like he was an athlete.

602
00:36:37,060 --> 00:36:37,361
Speaker 1: you know.

603
00:36:37,521 --> 00:36:37,942
Speaker 1: that's how.

604
00:36:38,023 --> 00:36:39,989
Speaker 1: that's why he was as good as he is.

605
00:36:40,571 --> 00:36:41,494
Speaker 0: but this is I mean.

606
00:36:41,775 --> 00:36:45,789
Speaker 0: I used to do anything I could that was within the rules to get an edge.

607
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:53,655
Speaker 0: and back in the quake two days I always played with an FOV of 120. so in a normal FPS by default you have a field of view of 90 degrees.

608
00:36:53,675 --> 00:36:58,374
Speaker 0: so you see this 90 degree chunk out from the eyes of your model and that's what you see.

609
00:36:58,394 --> 00:37:02,694
Speaker 0: now you don't have any peripheral vision or anything and that's just kind of the way FPS is were.

610
00:37:03,257 --> 00:37:10,563
Speaker 0: but a lot of really hardcore people in the quake two days would turn off all the textures or weaken all the textures or change the textures.

611
00:37:10,623 --> 00:37:12,029
Speaker 0: everything was kind of bland.

612
00:37:12,049 --> 00:37:28,646
Speaker 0: you get a higher frame rate and then they'd widen the FOV to like 110 120 130 hmm this basically if you watch someone play like that or now with quake live you can just do it and see the whole world looks like a fishbowl and it's incredibly disorienting if you're not used to it.

613
00:37:29,068 --> 00:37:35,494
Speaker 0: but if you can get used to it it gives you this gigantic edge over everyone else you can see people behind you and turn and shoot them.

614
00:37:36,016 --> 00:37:39,754
Speaker 0: it becomes a game of click on all the heads that are floating around the screen before they click on yours.

615
00:37:40,196 --> 00:37:45,597
Speaker 1: yeah well if you've you know got a railgun I mean if you don't you can't just click on the heads.

616
00:37:45,617 --> 00:37:45,978
Speaker 1: you got it.

617
00:37:46,299 --> 00:37:49,250
Speaker 1: yeah you got to maybe shoot a rocket at the feet you know.

618
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:53,426
Speaker 1: maybe throw some you know lead them with the plasma rifle a bit huh.

619
00:37:53,627 --> 00:37:58,610
Speaker 0: the only thing that I'm missing that I feel like I should have are my offhand grenades but I can live without that.

620
00:37:59,012 --> 00:38:02,527
Speaker 1: yeah well I mean you know you can get the grenade launcher if you really want to say there's.

621
00:38:02,628 --> 00:38:10,721
Speaker 0: there was something about throwing a grenade at a guy's feet shooting a rocket throwing another grenade bouncing him off of the second grenade into the rocket.

622
00:38:11,444 --> 00:38:12,126
Speaker 1: yeah I think you know.

623
00:38:12,668 --> 00:38:14,254
Speaker 1: I guess they could put grenades in it.

624
00:38:14,314 --> 00:38:17,949
Speaker 1: but yeah I guess there were grenades in quake 3 right so why should that?

625
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:19,256
Speaker 0: I feel like they should leave it as is.

626
00:38:19,858 --> 00:38:26,380
Speaker 1: I could foresee I'll bet that we that sort of gets rid of the the fact that it's this pure and simple game.

627
00:38:26,882 --> 00:38:29,312
Speaker 1: you know in terms of you know the act the game itself.

628
00:38:29,533 --> 00:38:30,437
Speaker 0: well what they could do?

629
00:38:30,457 --> 00:38:34,175
Speaker 0: I it'd be really interesting if they open this platform up to more games than just quite three.

630
00:38:34,235 --> 00:38:36,466
Speaker 0: like what if they put quite you and quick one on there?

631
00:38:36,486 --> 00:38:37,470
Speaker 0: there's no reason not to.

632
00:38:37,872 --> 00:38:40,444
Speaker 1: well I think this technically isn't quake 3 it's quake live.

633
00:38:40,524 --> 00:38:42,311
Speaker 1: right they don't want to call it quake 3.

634
00:38:42,311 --> 00:38:43,355
Speaker 0: well yeah but it's quite 3.

635
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:47,713
Speaker 1: yeah I there was an interview with Carmack and he talked about.

636
00:38:47,894 --> 00:38:48,837
Speaker 1: you know stuff like.

637
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:53,697
Speaker 1: you know if there were gonna be mods on there and stuff like that and I think they were talking about like.

638
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:58,942
Speaker 1: you know if they found maps from people that were really awesome they would put them in there and stuff like that.

639
00:38:59,042 --> 00:39:03,495
Speaker 1: so there's there's definitely gonna be more content in there.

640
00:39:03,576 --> 00:39:04,318
Speaker 1: at the very least.

641
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:10,124
Speaker 1: you know maybe more game modes because right now they got a few game modes and then they got CTF they got clan arena.

642
00:39:10,144 --> 00:39:14,222
Speaker 0: yeah but they're all the like quake 3 modes and I'll admit I don't like any of those modes.

643
00:39:15,245 --> 00:39:17,051
Speaker 0: back when they came out everyone hated him.

644
00:39:17,071 --> 00:39:17,833
Speaker 0: they were terrible.

645
00:39:18,475 --> 00:39:22,652
Speaker 1: yeah yeah well I mean that's the thing is you know it's like they're keeping it simple right.

646
00:39:22,813 --> 00:39:33,973
Speaker 1: this isn't about you know revolutionizing FPS even though I think it will in a small way because well because it's taking the pure FPS and making it accessible to the masses.

647
00:39:34,053 --> 00:39:41,177
Speaker 0: they took an FPS that I played in high school and just re-released it without doing much to it and it's already really popular.

648
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:53,036
Speaker 0: it's in beta and it's in many ways it feels fresher than a lot of new FPS is because it's so different from most games that people play today even though it's a game from when I was in high school.

649
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:57,012
Speaker 0: I know right I bought quake 3 when I was in high school.

650
00:39:57,153 --> 00:39:58,317
Speaker 1: I mean you could do the same thing.

651
00:39:58,337 --> 00:40:07,927
Speaker 1: I mean think about right if you want to look for originality in video games right the old PC games is where you know there were no genres in those olden days.

652
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:08,850
Speaker 1: you know things like.

653
00:40:09,111 --> 00:40:15,715
Speaker 1: you know mule and Starcraft and you know all these sorts of things totally defy genre completely like there's.

654
00:40:15,756 --> 00:40:17,623
Speaker 1: no those are the only games like those.

655
00:40:17,663 --> 00:40:18,806
Speaker 1: that's it right.

656
00:40:19,308 --> 00:40:25,969
Speaker 1: so if you get games like those from the early PC days and bring them back it's totally you know.

657
00:40:25,989 --> 00:40:26,470
Speaker 1: it's.

658
00:40:26,671 --> 00:40:28,035
Speaker 1: it's super fresh because this.

659
00:40:28,738 --> 00:40:38,712
Speaker 1: you haven't played anything like that since the olden days and it's the same you know even though FPS is as a whole are not fresh right this style of FPS is fresh.

660
00:40:38,752 --> 00:40:53,910
Speaker 1: I mean I could come out with like a Wolfenstein like game today right which is an FPS that primarily concentrates on you know mazes and secrets and that sort of thing as opposed to you know and down plays the shooting element and it would be totally fresh if you like that sort of thing you know.

661
00:40:54,773 --> 00:40:57,463
Speaker 0: so maybe we should get the forum together and play some games.

662
00:40:57,503 --> 00:40:59,090
Speaker 0: find one of those empty servers on there.

663
00:40:59,392 --> 00:41:00,155
Speaker 1: well you know the.

664
00:41:00,175 --> 00:41:01,761
Speaker 1: it's got a friend system right.

665
00:41:01,781 --> 00:41:03,526
Speaker 1: so just find out.

666
00:41:03,566 --> 00:41:05,492
Speaker 1: you know who everyone else's name is.

667
00:41:05,853 --> 00:41:07,096
Speaker 0: my name is rim.

668
00:41:07,116 --> 00:41:08,782
Speaker 1: yeah you can guess what my name is.

669
00:41:09,243 --> 00:41:11,633
Speaker 1: and then you know add people to your friends list.

670
00:41:11,693 --> 00:41:12,436
Speaker 1: it's pretty easy.

671
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:17,295
Speaker 1: and then when you're online fight look in their friends for you know who's playing.

672
00:41:17,315 --> 00:41:17,677
Speaker 1: enjoy.

673
00:41:17,717 --> 00:41:22,876
Speaker 1: now the thing is is a skill matching system and the skill matching system is pretty good.

674
00:41:23,076 --> 00:41:26,629
Speaker 1: you know it's not like super perfect but it's in the beginning.

675
00:41:26,669 --> 00:41:32,573
Speaker 0: it pretty much puts you in and says like get as far as you can get and then enter the and it doesn't even tell you anything.

676
00:41:32,934 --> 00:41:37,896
Speaker 1: it's just like get as far as you can get in this room and then it when you can't get any further go in the door.

677
00:41:37,977 --> 00:41:38,539
Speaker 0: it's great cuz.

678
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:43,660
Speaker 0: first is like you know jump over this thing and then rocket jump over this thing and then bunny hop.

679
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:48,238
Speaker 0: now bunny hopping again is something that has been like it's been taken out of.

680
00:41:48,278 --> 00:41:53,577
Speaker 0: a lot of FPS is and all that kind of jumping fiddly almost glitchy stuff was taken out of.

681
00:41:53,637 --> 00:41:55,244
Speaker 0: modern FPS is for a lot of reasons.

682
00:41:55,626 --> 00:41:59,322
Speaker 0: but you know in quake one it was clearly a glitch but people used it was part of the game.

683
00:41:59,784 --> 00:42:01,933
Speaker 0: quake two it was less of a glitch but it was still there.

684
00:42:02,234 --> 00:42:05,345
Speaker 0: quake three they coded it in because they knew people wanted it.

685
00:42:05,365 --> 00:42:06,991
Speaker 0: it was there on purpose.

686
00:42:07,392 --> 00:42:08,978
Speaker 0: yep that think.

687
00:42:09,078 --> 00:42:18,491
Speaker 0: think about how much the culture of FPS thing has changed from the glitch that was popular is coded into the game to the sterile ultra realistic games we have today.

688
00:42:18,511 --> 00:42:19,856
Speaker 1: yeah I did the rocket jump.

689
00:42:19,896 --> 00:42:21,523
Speaker 1: I didn't I couldn't I didn't do the be hop.

690
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:25,723
Speaker 0: well the thing is I think to fully do the be hop you got to start with a rocket.

691
00:42:25,903 --> 00:42:31,927
Speaker 1: yeah I try to do the Rockets right and what happened was is I actually ran out of rocket and then I also kill.

692
00:42:31,947 --> 00:42:37,189
Speaker 1: you know you're invincible so you couldn't kill yourself but you know I just ran out of rockets and I said fuck it and I went in the door.

693
00:42:37,932 --> 00:42:38,875
Speaker 1: so yeah.

694
00:42:38,896 --> 00:42:43,695
Speaker 1: and then you sort of fight this bot and I guess they sort of gauge how well you do against the bot.

695
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:48,334
Speaker 1: you know based on the bots difficulty which I think also changes a lot of people can't beat the bot.

696
00:42:48,696 --> 00:42:51,067
Speaker 1: yeah it's it's weird that people didn't beat the bot.

697
00:42:51,087 --> 00:42:51,449
Speaker 1: I mean like.

698
00:42:51,991 --> 00:42:54,744
Speaker 1: I started fighting the bot and it killed me a little bit and I was like oh crap.

699
00:42:54,764 --> 00:42:56,190
Speaker 1: and then I came back and beat it.

700
00:42:56,371 --> 00:43:02,094
Speaker 1: but it was weird that people were like yeah the bot kicked my ass and I was like oh that's that's too bad.

701
00:43:02,295 --> 00:43:07,474
Speaker 0: but pretty much anyone out there if you have a Windows PC quake 3 came out when I was in high school.

702
00:43:07,555 --> 00:43:09,663
Speaker 0: you can probably run quake 3.

703
00:43:09,663 --> 00:43:13,036
Speaker 1: you can definitely run quake 3. you could probably run this on a netbook most.

704
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:24,150
Speaker 1: so if it has any sort of 3d at all like an integrated cheap ass you know graphics chip an Intel even an Intel integrated thing will play quake 3.

705
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:27,262
Speaker 0: there is absolutely no reason not to download quake live and play it.

706
00:43:27,302 --> 00:43:34,247
Speaker 0: at least try even if you don't like FPS is or even if you don't like this kind of twitchy deathmatch gibbon FPS.

707
00:43:34,688 --> 00:43:38,240
Speaker 0: you should play it at least once to to see where we're coming from.

708
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:44,759
Speaker 0: this is this game is like the midpoint between my perfect FPS and a modern Halo FPS mm-hmm.

709
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:45,421
Speaker 1: and I'm just.

710
00:43:45,521 --> 00:43:50,600
Speaker 1: I'm just glad that you know there is a type of game that was that was lost and now is found.

711
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:52,527
Speaker 1: and you know people can.

712
00:43:52,607 --> 00:43:59,736
Speaker 1: actually you know when when I say oh man you don't know old-school FPS is I can't say oh well yeah you're not actually gonna be able to play any of them.

713
00:43:59,777 --> 00:44:00,339
Speaker 1: to find out.

714
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,660
Speaker 1: now I can say here you can at least go play quake live and then you'll know what I'm talking about.

715
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:07,915
Speaker 0: yeah because nothing was worse than nah man quick - was so much better.

716
00:44:08,015 --> 00:44:09,603
Speaker 0: yeah well how do I play it all right?

717
00:44:09,623 --> 00:44:12,376
Speaker 0: well first you got a pirate a copy of quake - I already got that.

718
00:44:12,436 --> 00:44:13,240
