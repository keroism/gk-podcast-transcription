1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,888
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, February 19th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,888 --> 00:00:11,049
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,664 --> 00:00:14,180
Speaker 1: I'm tired.

4
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,885
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,945 --> 00:00:20,339
Speaker 0: Tonight, Rome demands a review of Glory to Rome.

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,397
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,042 --> 00:00:27,519
Speaker 0: What, you don't like my long openers?

8
00:00:28,961 --> 00:00:30,772
Speaker 1: The opener is supposed to be a title, right?

9
00:00:30,832 --> 00:00:34,011
Speaker 1: This is the thing we actually... I shouldn't... I guess...

10
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:36,148
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

11
00:00:36,189 --> 00:00:36,712
Speaker 0: you shouldn't talk?

12
00:00:36,753 --> 00:00:37,780
Speaker 0: Is this a Geek Nights secret?

13
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:38,827
Speaker 1: Well, no.

14
00:00:38,867 --> 00:00:45,739
Speaker 1: You know how some people, when they write articles, will have ridiculously long titles that have way too much in them?

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,615
Speaker 0: Why learn to stop worrying and love the bomb?

16
00:00:48,676 --> 00:00:49,220
Speaker 0: That kind of thing?

17
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,602
Speaker 0: Well, no.

18
00:00:49,622 --> 00:00:50,389
Speaker 1: That's a good title.

19
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:54,299
Speaker 1: I'm talking about... Let's say there's a movie coming out, right?

20
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:55,414
Speaker 1: The headline should be...

21
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:58,859
Speaker 0: The boy who went up the mountain and came down a man?

22
00:00:59,421 --> 00:01:00,486
Speaker 1: New movie in theaters.

23
00:01:00,868 --> 00:01:03,220
Speaker 1: New movie title in theaters this Friday.

24
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:05,159
Speaker 1: That's a great... Perfect, right?

25
00:01:05,923 --> 00:01:14,599
Speaker 1: A bad headline would be like, "So-and-so, so-and-so, and so-and-so, star in action flick, so in such-and-such, being released on...".

26
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,020
Speaker 1: Because that's way too fucking long.

27
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,280
Speaker 0: That depends on what you're doing.

28
00:01:19,303 --> 00:01:23,900
Speaker 1: A lot of that information belongs in the opening paragraph, surely.

29
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:25,026
Speaker 1: In fact, all of it does.

30
00:01:25,408 --> 00:01:27,680
Speaker 1: But not in the headline, the title.

31
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:31,580
Speaker 0: But the headline of Geek Nights is whatever people see in iTunes.

32
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:36,500
Speaker 1: You just need to name the title, and the rest goes in paragraph one.

33
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:37,123
Speaker 0: I don't know.

34
00:01:37,204 --> 00:01:37,488
Speaker 0: I prefer...

35
00:01:37,508 --> 00:01:38,380
Speaker 1: The title should have less.

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:39,506
Speaker 0: I prefer drawing it out.

37
00:01:39,587 --> 00:01:41,419
Speaker 0: "In a world where Rem and Scott review fidget

38
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:41,540
Speaker 0: games.".

39
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,968
Speaker 1: That's not the title.

40
00:01:43,089 --> 00:01:44,840
Speaker 1: That is the tagline.

41
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:48,558
Speaker 0: Which we use there, because the title is in the ID3.

42
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,054
Speaker 1: No, the title has to be short.

43
00:01:51,095 --> 00:01:53,780
Speaker 1: You would never... You would be fired if you were the newspaper headline writer.

44
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:56,520
Speaker 0: Or I'd be the best newspaper headline writer in the world.

45
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,800
Speaker 1: No, you'd be fired because it wouldn't fit in the fucking newspaper cover.

46
00:01:58,901 --> 00:02:00,959
Speaker 0: It would fit just fine because newspapers are digital.

47
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,619
Speaker 1: Most of those motherfucker front-pagers are two words.

48
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:08,259
Speaker 0: I was very proud of my tweet the other day that basically was talking about newspapers.

49
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,359
Speaker 0: Reader's Digest is like a printed...

50
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,200
Speaker 1: That's not a newspaper.

51
00:02:12,181 --> 00:02:12,720
Speaker 1: That's not a newspaper.

52
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:13,965
Speaker 0: It's a print media.

53
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:16,460
Speaker 0: In fact, it's periodicals, which are doing worse than newspapers.

54
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:17,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are.

55
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,634
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I guess I have a periodical.

56
00:02:19,655 --> 00:02:20,440
Speaker 0: It's called Slash Shot.

57
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,940
Speaker 0: It updates every five minutes.

58
00:02:23,303 --> 00:02:25,900
Speaker 0: And that's the slow one for old people on the internet.

59
00:02:26,322 --> 00:02:26,676
Speaker 1: It sure is.

60
00:02:28,321 --> 00:02:34,760
Speaker 0: So, I've been playing a lot of a game that I couldn't play when you were first playing it, but Super Hexagon at some point came to Android.

61
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:35,780
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

62
00:02:36,021 --> 00:02:38,138
Speaker 0: I started playing that and after about... How good are you?

63
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,320
Speaker 0: After about three days, I can consistently get to about 35 seconds on Hexagon.

64
00:02:42,821 --> 00:02:43,499
Speaker 1: Oh, so you suck.

65
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:46,540
Speaker 0: I can get to about 25 seconds on Hexagoner.

66
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:47,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got nothing.

67
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,400
Speaker 0: And I can get to about seven seconds on Hexagonist.

68
00:02:49,681 --> 00:02:50,300
Speaker 1: About the same.

69
00:02:50,481 --> 00:02:52,660
Speaker 0: That's what I get for about three days of playing this game.

70
00:02:52,660 --> 00:02:57,759
Speaker 1: I think I've actually unlocked Hexagonister, the hardest one.

71
00:02:58,460 --> 00:02:58,865
Speaker 0: Hexagonister?

72
00:02:58,906 --> 00:02:59,980
Speaker 0: It sounds like Zormalgooster.

73
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,146
Speaker 1: It is, basically.

74
00:03:01,186 --> 00:03:01,448
Speaker 1: I don't know.

75
00:03:01,468 --> 00:03:02,455
Speaker 1: I forget what my scores are.

76
00:03:02,475 --> 00:03:03,180
Speaker 1: I have to look again.

77
00:03:03,841 --> 00:03:05,400
Speaker 1: I haven't played that in weeks, months.

78
00:03:06,021 --> 00:03:07,126
Speaker 0: Well, it's pretty fun.

79
00:03:07,146 --> 00:03:10,120
Speaker 0: The one problem is you can't really play it on a moving subway unless you sit down.

80
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,510
Speaker 0: So, that's the only time I play it.

81
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,415
Speaker 0: So, I feel like my 30 seconds...

82
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,100
Speaker 1: You've got to just play it before bed or something just once while you're still...

83
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,889
Speaker 0: My 30 seconds I got.

84
00:03:19,929 --> 00:03:22,060
Speaker 0: Like, the first, like, when I got to Triangle.

85
00:03:23,806 --> 00:03:27,640
Speaker 0: I was actually walking off of the end train as I was in the middle of it.

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,674
Speaker 0: I was, like, in the middle of this smooth run.

87
00:03:29,714 --> 00:03:30,078
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Oh,

88
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:30,340
Speaker 0: fuck!".

89
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,579
Speaker 0: And I just kind of walked and kept doing it and then I died.

90
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:41,000
Speaker 1: Rewind to a very old episode of Geek Nights where I talk about trying to play a DS trauma center surgery game.

91
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,320
Speaker 0: I was going to say, I remember you playing trauma center.

92
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,195
Speaker 1: On Metro North, right?

93
00:03:45,296 --> 00:03:45,660
Speaker 1: Train.

94
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, subway is easily ten times less stable.

95
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:50,826
Speaker 1: That's sitting on a train.

96
00:03:50,906 --> 00:03:52,433
Speaker 1: You're standing on a subway.

97
00:03:52,574 --> 00:03:53,820
Speaker 1: It's, like, whoa, way harder.

98
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like you can sit either.

99
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:58,421
Speaker 0: So, news.

100
00:03:58,642 --> 00:04:08,620
Speaker 0: A while ago, you know, I upgraded... Well, Emily upgraded her video card from a card so old it uses the old nomenclature to 260.

101
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:12,720
Speaker 0: And then we just bought her a 660 because she's doing video and audio and all this kind of stuff.

102
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:14,187
Speaker 0: And, you know, rendering.

103
00:04:14,228 --> 00:04:16,200
Speaker 0: It's a good thing to have a good video card.

104
00:04:16,742 --> 00:04:22,660
Speaker 0: So, I'm still rocking my 260, which for gaming is fine, because I'm not really playing any super new games.

105
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:24,439
Speaker 1: But for penis measuring, sucks.

106
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,200
Speaker 0: Also, can't use that for hardware rendering of effects in Premiere.

107
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:36,500
Speaker 1: Let me tell you, once that Premiere GPU thing activated, it's like every video just, like, load instantly, play instantly.

108
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,220
Speaker 1: I didn't have to much enter and wait for things to render.

109
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,060
Speaker 1: You know what I really need it for?

110
00:04:39,221 --> 00:04:45,040
Speaker 0: So, the main trouble I have is, let's say, I'm doing ghetto camera angles.

111
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:51,000
Speaker 0: So, I got three cameras and by zooming into different parts of the frame, I have, say, nine camera angles of us in a panel.

112
00:04:51,681 --> 00:04:59,620
Speaker 0: All right, so now I got nine HD streams and I want to watch them all simultaneously and live camera angles while I watch the whole thing.

113
00:05:00,562 --> 00:05:01,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, can't do that.

114
00:05:02,401 --> 00:05:12,280
Speaker 0: So, the way I did it last time is I only showed two of those streams and I just noted which black box was which and just kind of fuck it.

115
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:19,471
Speaker 0: It worked okay, but the only reason I haven't bought a 680 yet is because I was waiting for this time.

116
00:05:19,651 --> 00:05:25,000
Speaker 0: right now when NVIDIA starts to announce the next round of video cards and all the older ones get a little bit cheaper.

117
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,280
Speaker 1: I think the 780 is still a ways out.

118
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:34,740
Speaker 0: Oh no, it is, but they announced early because I actually didn't expect them to announce the 7XX series until March.

119
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,840
Speaker 1: Probably, maybe even, who knows, a while.

120
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,774
Speaker 1: Maybe, I was guessing March.

121
00:05:38,422 --> 00:05:38,860
Speaker 1: It's got a while.

122
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:46,380
Speaker 0: But I wasn't paying attention to NVIDIA and out of nowhere, they announced the GTX Titan is going to be available to consumers.

123
00:05:46,501 --> 00:05:49,900
Speaker 1: I don't think this is going to change the price of the 680.

124
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:52,000
Speaker 0: Well, it didn't as of today.

125
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,659
Speaker 1: I don't think it's going to because it's not.

126
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:03,880
Speaker 0: What's interesting is that there are numerous accounts that it performs right now about as well for like dollars per unit of power as the 690.

127
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:14,440
Speaker 1: Right, well here's what I think happened, right, is basically they realized, hey, the X90s, right, all of those people don't know, like 690, 590.

128
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,580
Speaker 0: It's just an overclock 80.

129
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,919
Speaker 1: It's just the 81, crazy overclock.

130
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:22,260
Speaker 0: Well, kind of like how the 70 is usually just, it's been in, it's one that just kind of sucks.

131
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,680
Speaker 1: They pick up the price like by double and they overclock it.

132
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,800
Speaker 1: It's the same thing as the Intel Extreme series.

133
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:34,577
Speaker 1: It's the same i7 that I have, only they overclock it ridiculously and put their guarantee on it that it won't break and they charge $1,000 for it.

134
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,380
Speaker 0: If I was going to give you generic advice, get an X60 if you're just playing games.

135
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,200
Speaker 0: Get an X80 if you're also doing video editing.

136
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:49,760
Speaker 1: I would get an X80 if you need it for anything and you can afford it because the 80 is always the best.

137
00:06:49,941 --> 00:06:51,109
Speaker 0: The X60 was like $250 cheaper though.

138
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,808
Speaker 1: It's a lot cheaper, yeah.

139
00:06:53,829 --> 00:06:55,058
Speaker 1: That's why I said, if you can afford it.

140
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,833
Speaker 1: And let me tell you, now that I got the 680, I can play NS2 at max settings at 1900 by 1200 resolution.

141
00:07:04,241 --> 00:07:06,520
Speaker 0: I'll bet the 660 can do the same thing for NS2.

142
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:12,240
Speaker 1: At 60 frames a second while recording it with FRAPS at 60 frames a second and I never lose a frame.

143
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,239
Speaker 0: Yeah, Fred, the bottleneck on FRAPS is disk I/O.

144
00:07:16,384 --> 00:07:18,499
Speaker 1: With a non-SSD I'm recording to.

145
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:20,800
Speaker 1: And full frames.

146
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:31,060
Speaker 0: Anyway, the deal with the Titan is that it was used in this big supercomputer and it's kind of, basically it's the most powerful like consumer video card ever.

147
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,317
Speaker 1: Well, what it is, is basically it's like, hey, the 690 is just an overclock 680, so it's crazy.

148
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:41,793
Speaker 1: But the Titan is actually like the next generation, but the actual next generation.

149
00:07:41,853 --> 00:07:44,620
Speaker 1: to make it affordable for us and normal people is a ways off.

150
00:07:45,102 --> 00:07:49,760
Speaker 1: So like, well, we'll just give you the crazy rare supercomputer edition if you really want to.

151
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,860
Speaker 1: It costs the same as the 690 and performs similarly, but it's a lot more.

152
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,480
Speaker 0: It has the CUDA cores like I use for rendering, but the thing is.

153
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:07,200
Speaker 1: It's way more power efficient and makes less heat than the 690 because it's not an overclock 680, it's a regular clocked supercomputer GPU.

154
00:08:08,001 --> 00:08:13,880
Speaker 0: It has so many of those CUDA cores, but it's a thousand dollars.

155
00:08:14,172 --> 00:08:14,298
Speaker 1: Yep.

156
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:16,840
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, not going to buy one, but.

157
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,580
Speaker 1: No, no one, unless you are lottery winning this really just buy a 680.

158
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:28,220
Speaker 0: So I read a review from some dude who was like, yeah, so I SLI this motherfucker and I'm like, what the fuck is wrong with you?

159
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:28,700
Speaker 1: Where did he go?

160
00:08:29,443 --> 00:08:31,240
Speaker 1: That is his only hobby computer.

161
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,698
Speaker 0: This was like reviewer got three of them.

162
00:08:34,902 --> 00:08:36,539
Speaker 1: If Nvidia gives me three of them.

163
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:36,977
Speaker 1: Yes.

164
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:37,799
Speaker 1: Sure.

165
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:41,034
Speaker 0: My electric bill will go up substantially and I'll get 10,000 frames per second.

166
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:43,839
Speaker 0: And that won't matter.

167
00:08:44,265 --> 00:08:44,539
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

168
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,780
Speaker 1: I'll take it for free.

169
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:46,685
Speaker 0: It's got 2,688 cores.

170
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:49,396
Speaker 1: I'll take it.

171
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:49,730
Speaker 1: I'll run.

172
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,180
Speaker 0: I'll do Bitcoin.

173
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,299
Speaker 0: And another 900 double precision cars.

174
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,080
Speaker 1: If someone gave me those fuckers for free, Bitcoin city, Bitcoin and a folding at home.

175
00:08:58,582 --> 00:09:02,280
Speaker 0: It has as much RAM as my current computer had when I built it.

176
00:09:02,661 --> 00:09:03,039
Speaker 0: Six gigs.

177
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,639
Speaker 0: Only six gigs actually.

178
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:23,392
Speaker 0: Anyway, uh, I'm hoping because someone from Nvidia, I can't super verify this or take it with a grain of salt, but I read a report that someone in video said that this series of cards, well, chips is if pretty much across the board, going to be faster than the seven X, X series of cards,

179
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:24,280
Speaker 1: probably.

180
00:09:24,561 --> 00:09:27,280
Speaker 0: And that, I don't know if this means they're going to spend a thousand.

181
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:29,500
Speaker 1: I mean the six nineties more powerful than anything.

182
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:32,000
Speaker 0: So why wouldn't be, these aren't going to replace the quadros.

183
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,960
Speaker 0: So I wonder where these fit in their product line.

184
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,831
Speaker 1: Are these going to be like the crazy type in 700 series for crazy rich people.

185
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,895
Speaker 0: But what's the difference between this and the 700 series?

186
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:46,776
Speaker 0: Cause if this is priced at a thousand dollars, what are they going to price the seven 80 at?

187
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:50,149
Speaker 1: If it's just worse, the seven 80 will be $500 probably just like the six 80 was.

188
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,339
Speaker 1: seven 90 will probably be 900 to a thousand dollars.

189
00:09:56,661 --> 00:10:03,320
Speaker 0: But the thing is, if the performance is that much different and these are more expensive, one is better.

190
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:03,720
Speaker 1: Sure.

191
00:10:04,121 --> 00:10:07,479
Speaker 0: But now they've broken their model of now they're going to have, they're going to have more tears.

192
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,117
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

193
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:09,459
Speaker 1: So why do you mean they broke it?

194
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:09,811
Speaker 0: No, no.

195
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:15,960
Speaker 0: So the model they, they have, they're sort of like, they have their high end, like render whatever GPUs, right?

196
00:10:16,502 --> 00:10:17,360
Speaker 1: They're professionals.

197
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:19,439
Speaker 0: They're GTX four or five, six, seven.

198
00:10:19,668 --> 00:10:19,880
Speaker 0: Right.

199
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:23,780
Speaker 0: Now they're going to in parallel to both of those have the Titan series, right?

200
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:24,700
Speaker 1: For the crazy rich people.

201
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:25,920
Speaker 1: How is that broken?

202
00:10:26,381 --> 00:10:31,601
Speaker 0: It just seems weird that the ma that one of these will be about the same price point as the X 90.

203
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:37,679
Speaker 0: And if the seven hundreds are less, if the 700 like the seven 60 is, well, the seven 80, let's say is slower than this.

204
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,940
Speaker 1: Of course it's going to be slower.

205
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:39,603
Speaker 1: I wouldn't it be.

206
00:10:39,784 --> 00:10:41,473
Speaker 1: the seven 80 is going to be like $200.

207
00:10:41,473 --> 00:10:42,860
Speaker 1: of course it's gotta be slower.

208
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:46,300
Speaker 0: I don't think the seven 80 is going to be $200 and I think it'd be five or 600.

209
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:51,724
Speaker 1: You said seven 60 and I said seven 80 and so did you, the seven 80 is going to be $500.

210
00:10:51,724 --> 00:10:52,660
Speaker 1: That makes perfect sense.

211
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:54,733
Speaker 1: Of course it should be slower than the thousand dollars.

212
00:10:54,753 --> 00:10:55,739
Speaker 1: CPU GPU.

213
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,324
Speaker 1: Duh.

214
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:57,345
Speaker 0: Yeah.

215
00:10:57,641 --> 00:10:58,720
Speaker 0: But where does this fit in the tear?

216
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,260
Speaker 0: Are they going to number these the same way?

217
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,929
Speaker 0: It'll be, it will be like seven, 67, seven, 70, 80 Titan.

218
00:11:04,385 --> 00:11:05,040
Speaker 0: Are they going to be the eight?

219
00:11:05,321 --> 00:11:07,519
Speaker 1: No, the Titan isn't even numbered with a, with a seven.

220
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:08,640
Speaker 0: How are they?

221
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:09,960
Speaker 0: Are they going to number with something?

222
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,060
Speaker 1: Are they going to be curious what the fucking number is?

223
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,580
Speaker 1: The numbers that don't even make sense anyway.

224
00:11:14,342 --> 00:11:15,760
Speaker 0: Well, actually they kind of do make sense.

225
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:21,440
Speaker 1: Like you just, the Titan is a thing that anyone can ignore because they are, anyone listening to this is not stupid.

226
00:11:21,921 --> 00:11:23,160
Speaker 1: Just money coming out their butt.

227
00:11:24,501 --> 00:11:25,600
Speaker 0: The thing is, so how about this?

228
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,419
Speaker 1: If you want a lottery, you can buy one of these fuckers.

229
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:35,739
Speaker 0: There any reason on God's green earth to buy a seven 90 or a six 90 let's say a six 90 instead of this, if they're comparable in price.

230
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:37,220
Speaker 1: No, you should.

231
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,560
Speaker 1: The nineties become stupid.

232
00:11:38,621 --> 00:11:38,853
Speaker 1: Yeah.

233
00:11:39,721 --> 00:11:46,900
Speaker 1: Because if you're going to buy a 90 right, if it's about the same price as the Titan, then get the Titan cause it makes less heat and use like less electricity.

234
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:47,101
Speaker 1: I guess

235
00:11:47,121 --> 00:12:08,619
Speaker 0: the reason I'm not concerned as I'm curious is because there's been a trend over time with the naming of processors and components of computers to use the numbers to obfuscate the reality of the binning while simultaneously to confuse consumers and make certain cards or things appear to be better values than they actually are.

236
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,420
Speaker 1: Here's the reason why it's pretty simple, right?

237
00:12:10,841 --> 00:12:12,760
Speaker 1: Somebody could come out of nowhere, right?

238
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:18,159
Speaker 1: Like Intel or Nvidia or AMD or whoever, and just start naming things one, two, three.

239
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:22,480
Speaker 0: But then, and then the, their competitor will come out and say, yeah, well, here's the nine.

240
00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:25,000
Speaker 1: No, here's the reason why that doesn't work.

241
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,220
Speaker 1: The reason why is because that simple numbering, right?

242
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:36,660
Speaker 1: Is nobody who would need that simple numbering is a person who ever buys chips or GPS.

243
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:44,040
Speaker 1: Anyone who, you know, anyone that marketing would work on is someone who just buys a full computer and doesn't even know what parts are in it, right?

244
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:51,659
Speaker 1: The only people buying computer parts are nerds like us and complicated numbering systems work better to market to crazy nerds.

245
00:12:51,841 --> 00:13:04,140
Speaker 0: Ah, but they, I think they only do so partly because especially, I remember there's an era of Intel chips and the separate era of AMD chips where they'd have like a series like a 600, 700, something like that, but then they'd have fifties in between.

246
00:13:04,882 --> 00:13:12,560
Speaker 0: But the fit, there was no correlation between like five 56, 57, 50 and 500, 600, 700.

247
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:19,940
Speaker 0: They were like this middle tier with weird amounts of cash and things, and it was unclear from benchmarks and the prices were all over the place.

248
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:27,539
Speaker 0: And I think it's just to be able to effectively capture prices from a wide demographic of people with varying levels of technical skills and research abilities.

249
00:13:28,846 --> 00:13:29,760
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that's news.

250
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:31,178
Speaker 0: It's just, I've always found it really annoying.

251
00:13:32,004 --> 00:13:32,378
Speaker 1: What do you get?

252
00:13:32,641 --> 00:13:34,758
Speaker 1: It's a reality of bidding, as you said, not bolt.

253
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:45,357
Speaker 0: Now the reality that's the reality of bidding coupled with a crass desire to do maximal price discovery against your, uh, well, I mean, you got all these chips, they're binned, right?

254
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:57,020
Speaker 1: If you didn't do this sort of weird numbering thing that everyone, you know, that everyone would sort of pick, you know, one slot and then basically all the other bins wouldn't sell and the prices on them would drop.

255
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,300
Speaker 1: So basically you obfuscate so that you can sell, you know, that's what I'm saying.

256
00:14:02,462 --> 00:14:04,660
Speaker 1: Each bin sells in accordance with its quantity.

257
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:09,100
Speaker 1: You've got a lot in a, you got to lower the price on being a, to sell more of those.

258
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,039
Speaker 0: That's exactly what I said.

259
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:18,820
Speaker 0: You obfuscate your pricing by having these weird model numbers in order to do maximal price discovery against the majority of your customers.

260
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:25,999
Speaker 1: Very few people are going to figure like bin C would be empty because everyone bought them all and a, B and D would be full.

261
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,779
Speaker 1: And you'd be like, fuck, I didn't sell any of these.

262
00:14:28,231 --> 00:14:28,378
Speaker 1: Yeah.

263
00:14:29,163 --> 00:14:29,877
Speaker 1: What do I do now?

264
00:14:30,882 --> 00:14:34,796
Speaker 1: And then they get to lower the price in them so much to sell them that everyone's ripping your ass off.

265
00:14:36,503 --> 00:14:37,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's it.

266
00:14:38,243 --> 00:14:40,039
Speaker 0: All I said was it's always kind of annoyed me.

267
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,390
Speaker 0: I didn't know what I knew about it.

268
00:14:42,641 --> 00:14:46,099
Speaker 1: I didn't even propose doing anything about it the way it's got to be.

269
00:14:46,522 --> 00:14:49,099
Speaker 0: I could partly I bring it up because a lot of people don't realize it.

270
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:49,879
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't.

271
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:57,840
Speaker 1: And you know what the fact is, is it's not even that big a deal because most of the chips aren't even sold directly to the customers that are seeing that marketing.

272
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:00,560
Speaker 1: They're being sold to like Dell buys a zillion of them.

273
00:15:00,721 --> 00:15:01,299
Speaker 1: Well, here's an example.

274
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,620
Speaker 0: Recently I've had several friends be like, hey, I'm going to build a new computer.

275
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,405
Speaker 0: How does this build look?

276
00:15:05,425 --> 00:15:09,158
Speaker 0: Or they'd be like, they'd show me two CPUs, two Intel CPUs, two I fives.

277
00:15:10,623 --> 00:15:12,058
Speaker 0: They're priced about the same.

278
00:15:12,681 --> 00:15:13,283
Speaker 0: They're wildly.

279
00:15:13,444 --> 00:15:17,400
Speaker 0: they have different speeds and caches and number and product numbers.

280
00:15:17,943 --> 00:15:19,899
Speaker 0: And it's not clear the difference between them.

281
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:26,000
Speaker 1: Probably if they bought either one, odds are they wouldn't notice a difference in their everyday work anyway.

282
00:15:26,141 --> 00:15:30,501
Speaker 1: Probably they would never, they would never know which one would have been better for them.

283
00:15:30,601 --> 00:15:37,080
Speaker 1: If it saved them a microsecond here or there, they would never notice and have no effect in their lives, probably one of them is broken.

284
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:48,580
Speaker 0: So what that could cause, remember that TED talk way back where the guy was like, if you pick between two pairs of jeans, you're going to be happy no matter what you pick between a thousand, you're going to be unhappy no matter what, even if you got better genes objectively.

285
00:15:49,402 --> 00:16:06,762
Speaker 0: I think all of this together contributes probably not necessarily by design, but just in practice to the weird upgrade cycle where people are into computers upgrade more often than they need to, even when they can't themselves articulate the actual difference.

286
00:16:06,782 --> 00:16:09,960
Speaker 1: because they had so many choices, they felt bad about the one they got.

287
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:10,443
Speaker 0: Yup.

288
00:16:10,887 --> 00:16:11,452
Speaker 1: You know, I do.

289
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:14,159
Speaker 0: I decide which processor to buy.

290
00:16:14,642 --> 00:16:18,964
Speaker 0: I just list all of them in order by price and I decide how much money I'm willing to spend.

291
00:16:18,984 --> 00:16:20,540
Speaker 0: And I look at what's there.

292
00:16:21,242 --> 00:16:24,260
Speaker 0: The only other thing I do is look to see if there's a plateau that I didn't notice.

293
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:28,243
Speaker 1: I buy the one with the most golden eggs and the one with the most trophies next to it on Newegg.

294
00:16:28,504 --> 00:16:29,952
Speaker 0: Ah, but what if one just came out?

295
00:16:29,992 --> 00:16:31,661
Speaker 0: that's better but hasn't gotten anything yet?

296
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:35,545
Speaker 1: Because you can tell by looking at it, if that's like the hot new one that's got the most eggs.

297
00:16:35,565 --> 00:16:36,960
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, because all the nerds buy it immediately.

298
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:38,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what you want.

299
00:16:38,089 --> 00:16:39,119
Speaker 0: Anyway, you got any news?

300
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,480
Speaker 1: I do have a news that I'm trying to remember.

301
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:45,420
Speaker 0: I think you want to talk about valve steam.

302
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:46,424
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

303
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:50,060
Speaker 1: So steam Linux, which I think we've talked about before a zillion times.

304
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:50,462
Speaker 1: Right.

305
00:16:50,502 --> 00:16:51,659
Speaker 0: We've scoffed and laughed.

306
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:55,684
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, in ancient history, we've talked about, man, if only steam would come out on Linux, I can't.

307
00:16:55,804 --> 00:17:00,165
Speaker 0: I got to switch back to back when I'm back with Linux was my primary operating system.

308
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:08,180
Speaker 1: I got to switch back to Windows because the no games on Linux, you know, and then I used to do geek nights in Linux and reboot to play Counter-Strike.

309
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:12,380
Speaker 1: And then we talked about how, you know, more recently it was in beta.

310
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:13,539
Speaker 1: Well, now it's out out.

311
00:17:13,761 --> 00:17:17,300
Speaker 1: You can get steam for Linux for reals and they put a sale on Linux games.

312
00:17:17,401 --> 00:17:20,700
Speaker 1: And of course, there's not too many Linux games that you can get.

313
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:21,550
Speaker 1: There's just a few.

314
00:17:21,570 --> 00:17:21,896
Speaker 1: Come on.

315
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:26,740
Speaker 0: They got a serious Sam three half life and Counter-Strike source.

316
00:17:27,586 --> 00:17:28,277
Speaker 0: OK, not go.

317
00:17:28,882 --> 00:17:29,225
Speaker 0: All right.

318
00:17:29,808 --> 00:17:31,439
Speaker 1: Who go will be there soon enough?

319
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:35,200
Speaker 1: Well, see, all the valve games will be there, which is, I guess, cool, right?

320
00:17:35,561 --> 00:17:40,103
Speaker 1: And if they got dota to that because that's one of their games as well, that would be pretty big.

321
00:17:40,203 --> 00:17:43,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, NS two is not on there.

322
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:51,898
Speaker 1: In fact, you know what event is to actually came out on Linux and it worked just as well as the windows one for reals.

323
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:57,701
Speaker 1: And there was a fraps for Linux that worked as well as fraps on windows and such and such.

324
00:17:58,927 --> 00:18:01,520
Speaker 1: I'm not really playing too many other games right now.

325
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,859
Speaker 1: I probably could switch.

326
00:18:03,621 --> 00:18:10,500
Speaker 1: So you say that, but I but I have a giant library of thousands of dollars of steam games, most of which will never run on Linux ever.

327
00:18:10,842 --> 00:18:14,964
Speaker 0: I did switch to Linux for a long time and I went back because, yeah, I couldn't play it in my fucking game.

328
00:18:15,104 --> 00:18:19,485
Speaker 1: That's like if I didn't care about games, I'd probably use Linux and nothing but Linux.

329
00:18:19,948 --> 00:18:21,740
Speaker 0: I'm really doubling down on the Counter-Strike.

330
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,651
Speaker 1: It's really just an escape hatch for valve.

331
00:18:24,711 --> 00:18:30,380
Speaker 1: in case, you know, I mean, I could see right by the time Windows nine, Windows 10 comes along right.

332
00:18:30,921 --> 00:18:35,218
Speaker 1: Ten, fifteen years from now, it's like, well, Windows is pretty much dead.

333
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:38,900
Speaker 1: You know, desktop PCs are dead for most people, right?

334
00:18:39,081 --> 00:18:46,199
Speaker 1: It's pretty much anyone who does have a desktop PC, it's going to be Linux in, you know, that far out from now.

335
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:49,460
Speaker 1: And most people just use tablets and nothing now there.

336
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,359
Speaker 1: Who knows wearable devices and such?

337
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:51,781
Speaker 1: Who knows?

338
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:58,280
Speaker 1: So it's really, hey, in order to keep making PC games, they need a PC platform and a Windows disappears.

339
00:18:59,003 --> 00:18:59,567
Speaker 1: You need this.

340
00:18:59,587 --> 00:18:59,769
Speaker 0: Yeah.

341
00:18:59,809 --> 00:19:01,100
Speaker 0: So it's good to do the groundwork now.

342
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:07,453
Speaker 0: And also it lets them get the expertise they would need to be able to pretty much straight up make a steam console.

343
00:19:07,473 --> 00:19:08,179
Speaker 0: that actually was good.

344
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:08,561
Speaker 1: Yeah.

345
00:19:08,661 --> 00:19:16,340
Speaker 1: And it could also significantly just help the development of Linux itself to get all, you know, more users, more focus on certain things.

346
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:20,966
Speaker 0: Maybe for the audio, the audio that works, my God, audio that works, get some fucking audio that works.

347
00:19:21,087 --> 00:19:22,439
Speaker 0: It doesn't fucking work in Linux.

348
00:19:22,721 --> 00:19:22,904
Speaker 1: Yeah.

349
00:19:22,944 --> 00:19:24,240
Speaker 1: What if my game has surround sound?

350
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:25,560
Speaker 1: I want to port it to Linux steam.

351
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:26,840
Speaker 1: You better make that fucking surround sound.

352
00:19:27,362 --> 00:19:29,060
Speaker 1: So I can hear the skulks come from behind.

353
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:29,682
Speaker 1: They just got.

354
00:19:29,802 --> 00:19:35,860
Speaker 0: even if every game on steam were on Linux with perfect performance and audio and video worked fine.

355
00:19:35,941 --> 00:19:37,299
Speaker 0: You know what I still couldn't do on Linux?

356
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:38,638
Speaker 0: Make geek nights.

357
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,825
Speaker 1: That's not my problem.

358
00:19:41,929 --> 00:19:53,179
Speaker 1: But the thing is, right, if the other desktop OS is, you know, evaporate, even Adobe would be forced to put all this stuff on Linux if it could, which may be very difficult for them.

359
00:19:53,581 --> 00:19:56,760
Speaker 1: I'm sure they were able to get it on OS X and Windows.

360
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:57,767
Speaker 1: I'm sure they could also.

361
00:19:57,868 --> 00:19:59,360
Speaker 0: I'm sure they have a similar escape.

362
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:01,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, they can do it if they really needed to.

363
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,760
Speaker 1: They've actually been doing really well lately.

364
00:20:03,503 --> 00:20:04,267
Speaker 1: I'm thinking right.

365
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:05,974
Speaker 1: like when do they often do?

366
00:20:05,995 --> 00:20:07,504
Speaker 1: they come out with the new windows or Windows?

367
00:20:07,524 --> 00:20:08,900
Speaker 1: seven came out in seven.

368
00:20:09,624 --> 00:20:09,888
Speaker 1: Right.

369
00:20:10,253 --> 00:20:10,660
Speaker 1: Is that correct?

370
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:11,425
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

371
00:20:11,566 --> 00:20:13,419
Speaker 1: I remember whatever it came out.

372
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:14,358
Speaker 1: Oh, ten, maybe.

373
00:20:14,741 --> 00:20:15,050
Speaker 0: Oh, ten.

374
00:20:17,542 --> 00:20:19,519
Speaker 1: But I forget when it came out.

375
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,720
Speaker 1: But, you know, ten, ten by twenty thirty.

376
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:29,220
Speaker 0: Who knows if desktop PCs or be, you know, you could have said the year twenty five, twenty five, but you didn't.

377
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:29,907
Speaker 0: You said twenty thirty.

378
00:20:29,968 --> 00:20:30,920
Speaker 1: That's farther away.

379
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:31,543
Speaker 1: Yeah.

380
00:20:31,825 --> 00:20:34,619
Speaker 1: By then, for sure, nothing that we know will be.

381
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,917
Speaker 0: Well, they had like Windows 11 and the PS5.

382
00:20:37,942 --> 00:20:38,610
Speaker 1: How old will be?

383
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:39,379
Speaker 1: Like 70 something.

384
00:20:41,163 --> 00:20:43,340
Speaker 0: In the year twenty five, twenty five, we will be long dead.

385
00:20:43,861 --> 00:20:46,359
Speaker 0: Are you sure you will be long dead?

386
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:47,401
Speaker 1: Will I?

387
00:20:53,811 --> 00:21:05,639
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day, someone and by someone, I mean the LOTR project took Tolkien's main works, Return of the King, Fellowship of the Ring, The Hobbit, Two Towers, Silmarillion.

388
00:21:06,762 --> 00:21:09,920
Speaker 1: And they just did a huge big data data analysis thingy.

389
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:10,703
Speaker 0: That's pretty cool.

390
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:15,780
Speaker 0: You can just kind of fuck around with, you know, how often the different characters co-occur with one another.

391
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:18,820
Speaker 0: What is the average sentiment per sentence across the books?

392
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,260
Speaker 0: What are the most commonly used unique words in each of the books?

393
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:26,059
Speaker 0: It's you could click around in here forever.

394
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:27,720
Speaker 0: It's just there's weird stuff.

395
00:21:27,821 --> 00:21:30,540
Speaker 0: Like you'll look at this graph of like character co-occurrence.

396
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:32,539
Speaker 0: You're like, what's that dot all the way out over there?

397
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,020
Speaker 0: Oh, it's some hobbit.

398
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,160
Speaker 0: Well, he knows this other hobbit.

399
00:21:35,201 --> 00:21:36,580
Speaker 0: You can just go down this chain forever.

400
00:21:37,647 --> 00:21:38,519
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty cool.

401
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:48,080
Speaker 0: And apparently the most common words in the Return of the King are came shell Pippin far long, dark, Aragorn looked come men great away.

402
00:21:48,221 --> 00:21:51,660
Speaker 0: Lord Mary King went Frodo like Gandalf Sam.

403
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:53,359
Speaker 1: That sounds about right.

404
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:58,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, the hobbit is like Bilbo Thorin Mountain.

405
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:00,138
Speaker 1: It's about right.

406
00:22:02,773 --> 00:22:03,040
Speaker 1: All right.

407
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:07,800
Speaker 1: So I have not been to as many concerts as some people have in their lives.

408
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,860
Speaker 1: It's not my number one thing or close to it.

409
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:13,179
Speaker 1: But I have been to quite a few in my day, you know, more than some.

410
00:22:14,061 --> 00:22:18,360
Speaker 1: And it is a common thing at concerts in the United States that no one sits in chairs.

411
00:22:18,560 --> 00:22:20,440
Speaker 1: Everyone stands and people get pretty close.

412
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,453
Speaker 1: They pack it in.

413
00:22:21,696 --> 00:22:21,960
Speaker 1: Right.

414
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:31,360
Speaker 1: And if it's a metal concert or a rock concert, there may be moshing, dancing, rocking, head, banging, cheering, jumping, all kinds of stage diving activities.

415
00:22:32,322 --> 00:22:35,700
Speaker 1: One activity that does not happen, especially at the arena concerts.

416
00:22:35,941 --> 00:22:36,162
Speaker 1: Right.

417
00:22:36,202 --> 00:22:39,614
Speaker 1: But even at the small concerts is the on stage getting.

418
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,220
Speaker 1: you do not get on the stage.

419
00:22:41,501 --> 00:22:44,480
Speaker 1: There are usually three or four large people at the front.

420
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:48,096
Speaker 0: I pulled it off once in my entire life with the yes.

421
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:51,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, I forgot her name, too.

422
00:22:51,783 --> 00:22:52,932
Speaker 0: Anyway, I will look her up.

423
00:22:53,254 --> 00:22:53,980
Speaker 0: Vana, I think.

424
00:22:54,541 --> 00:22:54,844
Speaker 1: Yep.

425
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,220
Speaker 1: Anyway, from Croatia.

426
00:22:56,481 --> 00:22:57,084
Speaker 0: Yeah.

427
00:22:57,325 --> 00:22:59,959
Speaker 1: If you try to get on stage, they will stop you.

428
00:23:00,402 --> 00:23:04,059
Speaker 1: If you stage dive to the front, they'll just grab you and push you back into the crowd.

429
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:11,443
Speaker 0: How if the if the talent tries to pull you up, usually the bouncers will be like, hell, no, that's right.

430
00:23:11,483 --> 00:23:19,560
Speaker 1: Insurance motherfuckers, if you do manage to miraculously get on the stage, they will come on and tackle you and, you know, pull you away.

431
00:23:19,681 --> 00:23:19,862
Speaker 1: Right.

432
00:23:19,882 --> 00:23:22,860
Speaker 1: Because, you know, maybe you're trying to stab the performers.

433
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,602
Speaker 1: They don't fucking know.

434
00:23:23,723 --> 00:23:23,963
Speaker 1: Right.

435
00:23:24,505 --> 00:23:31,600
Speaker 1: However, here's a video on YouTube from a guy who got on stage with Steel Panther somehow.

436
00:23:32,121 --> 00:23:32,262
Speaker 1: Right.

437
00:23:32,282 --> 00:23:35,719
Speaker 1: He's up there with Steel Panther and security's not going after him.

438
00:23:36,382 --> 00:23:40,622
Speaker 1: I don't know what's up for the first few seconds because they don't show how the hell he got up there.

439
00:23:41,545 --> 00:23:45,720
Speaker 1: And then the guy in Steel Panther is the only one you can hear.

440
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,700
Speaker 1: You can't hear this guy talking because he has no microphone.

441
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:48,060
Speaker 1: Right.

442
00:23:48,744 --> 00:23:52,400
Speaker 1: Apparently, he claims he can play all their songs on guitar.

443
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:58,482
Speaker 1: He asked to borrow the guitarist's guitar and the guitarist is like, you're fucking full of shit.

444
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:02,279
Speaker 1: And they give him the guitar and then holy shit.

445
00:24:03,821 --> 00:24:08,957
Speaker 1: All I can say is that the actual guitarist doesn't know what the fuck to do when he doesn't have his guitar.

446
00:24:10,681 --> 00:24:15,441
Speaker 1: You got to watch this because this is the kind of thing that will happen never again, ever.

447
00:24:15,461 --> 00:24:20,180
Speaker 1: So to know that it did happen, though.

448
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:26,240
Speaker 1: Please try this, try to do this, if you're not me, go for this, try to do this.

449
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,043
Speaker 0: That's right.

450
00:24:27,184 --> 00:24:30,120
Speaker 1: Anyone who is not me needs to try to make this happen at every concert.

451
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,220
Speaker 1: I'm not going up against the large security people.

452
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:39,539
Speaker 0: I think the best would be if you convince the band, like hand you the instrument and then you just fucking suck.

453
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:39,961
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

454
00:24:39,981 --> 00:24:43,220
Speaker 1: No, you fucking just throw it in the audience to your friend and then he runs out.

455
00:24:43,602 --> 00:24:43,784
Speaker 1: Yeah.

456
00:24:44,168 --> 00:24:45,360
Speaker 0: Or you just start playing Stairway.

457
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:49,440
Speaker 1: Like the guy says, he's like, this is my guitar cost two hundred and fifty dollars.

458
00:24:49,622 --> 00:24:51,559
Speaker 1: If you break a string, you are right.

459
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:56,360
Speaker 0: Anyway, I have a mouthpiece for my trumpet that cost almost two hundred and fifty dollars.

460
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,123
Speaker 0: He was joking.

461
00:24:57,707 --> 00:25:00,200
Speaker 1: I mean, it might have been a $250 guitar, but not likely.

462
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,106
Speaker 1: It was probably more than that.

463
00:25:01,448 --> 00:25:03,020
Speaker 1: Anyway, it could have been like three hundred bucks.

464
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:06,700
Speaker 1: It's time for something at a moment or thing.

465
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,096
Speaker 1: Oh, it was the thing of the day, wasn't it?

466
00:25:08,177 --> 00:25:08,359
Speaker 1: Yeah.

467
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,147
Speaker 1: I met a moment.

468
00:25:09,187 --> 00:25:10,299
Speaker 0: I was tired.

469
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:11,124
Speaker 1: I'm tired.

470
00:25:11,144 --> 00:25:12,620
Speaker 0: You would like Scott to be less tired.

471
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,119
Speaker 1: Donate money, donate sugar.

472
00:25:16,202 --> 00:25:18,678
Speaker 1: If I drank Red Bull, I would do that now, but I don't know.

473
00:25:19,222 --> 00:25:21,360
Speaker 0: Scott, I got to tell you, you wouldn't like Red Bull.

474
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,840
Speaker 0: I know you wouldn't want is carbonated.

475
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,222
Speaker 1: Taste it.

476
00:25:23,303 --> 00:25:24,209
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought it was wasn't.

477
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,800
Speaker 1: I thought it was just like sugary syrup.

478
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:26,978
Speaker 0: It's lightly carbonated.

479
00:25:27,421 --> 00:25:28,351
Speaker 0: No, you would not like.

480
00:25:28,371 --> 00:25:29,240
Speaker 1: tasted it before.

481
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,620
Speaker 1: It tastes like cough medicine.

482
00:25:31,041 --> 00:25:33,419
Speaker 0: So you take cough medicine when you're sick?

483
00:25:33,762 --> 00:25:34,900
Speaker 0: No, really?

484
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,203
Speaker 0: Never.

485
00:25:35,244 --> 00:25:36,460
Speaker 0: Not if you're like sick and coughing.

486
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:38,060
Speaker 0: The doctors like take some fucking cough medicine.

487
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,027
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, I did.

488
00:25:39,067 --> 00:25:40,218
Speaker 1: But now I know it doesn't fucking work.

489
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,097
Speaker 0: True, but that's a separate thing.

490
00:25:43,224 --> 00:25:44,240
Speaker 0: So what what if it did work?

491
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:47,740
Speaker 0: Because Red Bull does work in terms of not being tired anymore.

492
00:25:48,444 --> 00:25:50,800
Speaker 1: Uh, because it might have some horrible side effects.

493
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:53,040
Speaker 1: It doesn't like having a heart attack and die.

494
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:57,380
Speaker 0: No, it's just caffeine and taurine and heart attack, glucose.

495
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:58,434
Speaker 1: Sure.

496
00:25:58,454 --> 00:25:58,639
Speaker 1: All right.

497
00:25:58,820 --> 00:26:03,631
Speaker 1: So metamoment, metamoment number one, the book club book is The Great Gatsby by F.

498
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:04,119
Speaker 0: Scott Fitzgerald.

499
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:05,580
Speaker 0: We're going to do a show on it on Thursday.

500
00:26:05,822 --> 00:26:06,578
Speaker 0: I hope you've read it.

501
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,680
Speaker 0: If you haven't read it yet, just read it.

502
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:09,896
Speaker 0: It'll take you like an hour.

503
00:26:10,561 --> 00:26:12,360
Speaker 1: Unless you can't read widget case.

504
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,360
Speaker 1: That's a fucking problem.

505
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Speaker 1: It's a short story that is a problem that you have even more reason to read.

506
00:26:17,681 --> 00:26:19,759
Speaker 1: You get fucking better at reading illiterate person.

507
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,819
Speaker 0: It's also a pretty good book.

508
00:26:21,081 --> 00:26:24,220
Speaker 0: And the umbrage the young kids took with the book was surprising.

509
00:26:24,901 --> 00:26:26,718
Speaker 0: Anyway, I can think of worse books.

510
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:30,340
Speaker 1: Metamoment number two is a new metamoment, everybody.

511
00:26:31,141 --> 00:26:34,300
Speaker 1: I'm going to announce something that was already announced on the Internet.

512
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:35,999
Speaker 0: Scott, before you announce, I'm going to say one thing.

513
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:37,037
Speaker 0: It's all you.

514
00:26:37,524 --> 00:26:38,136
Speaker 1: It's all me.

515
00:26:38,887 --> 00:26:39,420
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

516
00:26:39,885 --> 00:26:40,778
Speaker 0: I made the thing clip.

517
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:41,800
Speaker 0: I already clapped.

518
00:26:42,162 --> 00:26:43,238
Speaker 1: OK, I already got this.

519
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,340
Speaker 1: So some talking was going on in the forum.

520
00:26:46,802 --> 00:26:50,920
Speaker 0: And I have a shit variety, possibly a shit talk, a shit talk was happening.

521
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:56,800
Speaker 1: And I realized, hey, this shit talk is actually really easy to do and not shit talk.

522
00:26:57,422 --> 00:27:05,280
Speaker 1: So I said, hey, even though I'm doing a whole bunch of stuff like Kinetic Con, still got to do something for Paxos and East and Anime Boston.

523
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:06,579
Speaker 0: I started writing that one panel.

524
00:27:06,842 --> 00:27:08,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm going to start doing the other one maybe this weekend.

525
00:27:10,363 --> 00:27:12,220
Speaker 1: This will take me like no time at all.

526
00:27:12,441 --> 00:27:16,119
Speaker 1: So why the hell not do this instead of shit talking it?

527
00:27:16,705 --> 00:27:17,678
Speaker 1: So here's what we're going to do.

528
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:18,898
Speaker 1: We're already doing it.

529
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:24,020
Speaker 1: It is the FRC Gaming Grand Prix of twenty thirteen.

530
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:26,299
Speaker 1: Perhaps it could be the inaugural one.

531
00:27:27,002 --> 00:27:28,800
Speaker 1: Perhaps it could be the first annual.

532
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,280
Speaker 1: We'll see if it ever happens again.

533
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:34,060
Speaker 1: This is an experiment in all senses of at least one of these is happening.

534
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:41,292
Speaker 1: We are going to determine the best in gaming of listeners of Geek Nights and Rim.

535
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:45,639
Speaker 0: also, because I am well, I am technically listening to Geek Nights right now.

536
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:46,785
Speaker 1: I am the soldier.

537
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:52,680
Speaker 1: We are, in fact, listeners, jury game selector and rules maker of this entire thing.

538
00:27:52,860 --> 00:28:01,399
Speaker 0: The fact that when you announce this in the forum, I posted a picture of you as the game master from Hunger Games, and I didn't realize you'd never actually seen the movie.

539
00:28:01,540 --> 00:28:02,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, I read it.

540
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:02,879
Speaker 1: I know what that is.

541
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:03,798
Speaker 1: I just didn't know, you know.

542
00:28:04,501 --> 00:28:06,300
Speaker 1: Anyway, so here's how it works.

543
00:28:06,581 --> 00:28:08,011
Speaker 1: First, you have to join our forum.

544
00:28:08,052 --> 00:28:09,099
Speaker 1: if you're not in there already to.

545
00:28:09,300 --> 00:28:09,724
Speaker 1: You need to go to.

546
00:28:09,764 --> 00:28:11,640
Speaker 1: the thread is the top thread number three.

547
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,234
Speaker 1: You need to post in that thread by March 1st.

548
00:28:14,315 --> 00:28:21,208
Speaker 1: that yes, indeed, you are in if you are in your name goes into this public Google doc that only I can edit.

549
00:28:21,269 --> 00:28:22,620
Speaker 1: so far, believe it or not.

550
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:28,979
Speaker 1: There are thirty five names on this list of people who are competing for the title of best gamer in FRC.

551
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:34,260
Speaker 1: Then on March 1st, I will announce the game of the first round.

552
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,200
Speaker 1: I have already chosen all four of the rounds, believe it or not.

553
00:28:38,420 --> 00:28:38,864
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

554
00:28:38,884 --> 00:28:40,980
Speaker 0: The trophy has to be this basketball block.

555
00:28:41,321 --> 00:28:44,060
Speaker 1: I think we really only have time for four rounds.

556
00:28:44,241 --> 00:28:48,520
Speaker 1: The rules of each round will be decided by me on a round by round basis.

557
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:50,058
Speaker 1: You will score points.

558
00:28:50,581 --> 00:28:56,688
Speaker 1: The top 10 finishers in each round will score championship points, just like an F1 Grand Prix.

559
00:28:57,331 --> 00:28:59,360
Speaker 1: after the four, I guess, races.

560
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:02,420
Speaker 1: Grand Prix's whoever has the most points will win.

561
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:04,520
Speaker 1: I'll keep adding new rounds if there's ties.

562
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,479
Speaker 1: So we'll guarantee you will not end in a tie.

563
00:29:07,421 --> 00:29:15,640
Speaker 1: You I'm going to make sure that every game selected is not a game or rule set that will exclude or disadvantage anyone.

564
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:17,637
Speaker 1: So I'm not going to pick games, for example, Scott.

565
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:19,699
Speaker 0: I have neither arms nor legs.

566
00:29:20,342 --> 00:29:26,820
Speaker 1: Oh, well, you might be disadvantaged, but I'm not going to, for example, pick a game where ping matters because we have international combatants.

567
00:29:27,401 --> 00:29:35,339
Speaker 1: I'm not going to pick a game that is expensive and difficult to obtain because international or financially challenged combatants may not be able to compete.

568
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,349
Speaker 0: You're not going to make it.

569
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:37,200
Speaker 1: I'm not going to choose.

570
00:29:37,862 --> 00:29:38,624
Speaker 0: Quick to.

571
00:29:38,845 --> 00:29:50,520
Speaker 1: I'm not going to choose and push up a PlayStation three or Xbox 360 or Wii U exclusive game because someone might not have that console and be or even if they did, they might not want to buy that game.

572
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:54,800
Speaker 1: So every game is going to be something that everyone will be able to play.

573
00:29:55,344 --> 00:29:56,520
Speaker 1: There may be multiplayer.

574
00:29:56,883 --> 00:29:58,280
Speaker 1: There may be single player.

575
00:29:58,481 --> 00:30:01,379
Speaker 1: There may be all kinds of things going on.

576
00:30:01,822 --> 00:30:07,579
Speaker 1: If you want to prove that you have more gaming skills than other people and maybe tabletop, it may be video.

577
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,239
Speaker 1: It may be who knows what, right?

578
00:30:09,861 --> 00:30:11,778
Speaker 1: If you want to prove that you're the best and win.

579
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:19,640
Speaker 1: And with this many entrants, I'm already guaranteeing at least a prize for at least the top finisher, if not more.

580
00:30:19,761 --> 00:30:28,060
Speaker 1: It's pretty easy to get trophies made or we could give them the belt or at worst, Amazon gift cards or board games of their choice or who knows what, right?

581
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,960
Speaker 0: They'll get 10 copies of Hellas, something like that.

582
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,479
Speaker 1: Board games I have that I want anymore.

583
00:30:33,403 --> 00:30:35,960
Speaker 1: A pile of comics that's sitting on my floor that I don't want anymore.

584
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:36,557
Speaker 1: Who knows?

585
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,379
Speaker 0: I got this old Samsung battery sitting here.

586
00:30:39,681 --> 00:30:40,050
Speaker 1: Sure.

587
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:40,460
Speaker 1: Right.

588
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,620
Speaker 1: There'll be prizes for whoever is on the podium.

589
00:30:43,121 --> 00:30:45,140
Speaker 1: Size of podium has yet to be determined.

590
00:30:47,042 --> 00:30:50,500
Speaker 1: But at very least, I guarantee the winner gloating rights.

591
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:57,839
Speaker 1: And in fact, even if you don't win, there are already 35 people that you might be able to gloat over if you're ahead of them, even if you're in second place.

592
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:02,939
Speaker 0: You just made in the future the dude who's actually in last place feel really bad.

593
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,112
Speaker 1: Oh, this is going to actually every every.

594
00:31:05,514 --> 00:31:09,460
Speaker 1: every game is actually going to be a fair test of skill.

595
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,260
Speaker 1: There's not going to be a lot of luck or forgiveness here.

596
00:31:13,481 --> 00:31:16,177
Speaker 1: So, yeah, last place should feel bad.

597
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:18,520
Speaker 1: But I am good.

598
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,280
Speaker 1: There's going to be great variety, right?

599
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:25,720
Speaker 1: So even if you're bad at gaming overall, one of these games may be up your alley.

600
00:31:25,861 --> 00:31:36,240
Speaker 1: And if you just score pretty much any number of championship points, considering in any round, only a third less than a third of players will get even one point scoring.

601
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,718
Speaker 1: Even a championship point will put you ahead of people.

602
00:31:39,879 --> 00:31:40,080
Speaker 1: Right.

603
00:31:40,181 --> 00:31:43,700
Speaker 1: So in any round, you can always make a big comeback.

604
00:31:44,022 --> 00:31:44,746
Speaker 1: So there you go.

605
00:31:45,027 --> 00:31:50,659
Speaker 1: Sign up for this before March 1st, when it begins and sign ups will close and the games shall begin.

606
00:31:51,964 --> 00:31:53,080
Speaker 1: Even cowards have come.

607
00:31:53,260 --> 00:31:55,259
Speaker 1: There are many cowards who said, I'll just watch.

608
00:31:55,482 --> 00:31:57,239
Speaker 1: And then they have come back to sign up.

609
00:31:57,421 --> 00:31:58,553
Speaker 0: I like to watch.

610
00:31:58,714 --> 00:31:59,220
Speaker 1: That's right.

611
00:32:00,222 --> 00:32:03,020
Speaker 1: And the other meta moments, I guess PAX East is the next event.

612
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,540
Speaker 0: PAX East, we're going to be there doing two or three events.

613
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,749
Speaker 0: We're also enforcers.

614
00:32:07,516 --> 00:32:07,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, great.

615
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,211
Speaker 0: I'm excited about that.

616
00:32:09,231 --> 00:32:10,099
Speaker 0: It's going to be a fun time.

617
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:10,621
Speaker 1: Whoo.

618
00:32:10,924 --> 00:32:12,239
Speaker 1: You can sign up to be an enforcer, too.

619
00:32:12,943 --> 00:32:15,120
Speaker 1: If you're not a coward who doesn't want to join the Grand Prix.

620
00:32:16,702 --> 00:32:20,960
Speaker 0: The pass phrase to join the secret forum and all that stuff was actually really cool and inspiring.

621
00:32:21,482 --> 00:32:22,475
Speaker 0: And like all this business.

622
00:32:22,677 --> 00:32:22,860
Speaker 1: Sure.

623
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:27,718
Speaker 0: It's it's exactly what every other con I joined the staff of should have been like.

624
00:32:28,961 --> 00:32:30,379
Speaker 1: OK, let's move on to the main bit.

625
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:35,240
Speaker 0: So for a while, I would see and Scott would see game conventions.

626
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,160
Speaker 0: We talked about this a little bit in previous episodes.

627
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,540
Speaker 1: Well, you go to any library at a gaming convention, right?

628
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,520
Speaker 1: The tabletop library.

629
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,580
Speaker 1: And there's always these games you see there every fucking time and you never, ever play them.

630
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:48,279
Speaker 1: But it's like the game that's been there for years and years and years.

631
00:32:48,881 --> 00:32:51,260
Speaker 1: And there's sort of like these games sort of clump up to each other.

632
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:52,679
Speaker 1: Like they're not the hot new games.

633
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:57,472
Speaker 0: You'll see like Fortress America and laying on top of that is like a red dragon in.

634
00:32:57,613 --> 00:32:58,099
Speaker 0: Oh, my God.

635
00:32:58,401 --> 00:32:59,277
Speaker 1: And a shade geek.

636
00:32:59,297 --> 00:32:59,440
Speaker 0: Yeah.

637
00:32:59,702 --> 00:33:00,959
Speaker 0: And maybe I guess you want to play.

638
00:33:01,401 --> 00:33:03,499
Speaker 1: Sometimes when you go in there, you find a gem.

639
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:07,300
Speaker 1: For example, I found Hive in one of those piles of forgotten games.

640
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:07,441
Speaker 0: Yeah.

641
00:33:07,461 --> 00:33:10,400
Speaker 0: And I'm glad we bought it because now the rerelease version is not as.

642
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,215
Speaker 1: And Hive is suddenly popular, huh?

643
00:33:12,397 --> 00:33:12,620
Speaker 1: Yeah.

644
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:17,440
Speaker 1: So one of those games I always saw in that pile, but didn't realize was a game called Glory to Rome.

645
00:33:17,741 --> 00:33:24,217
Speaker 0: Now, if nothing else, the tale of this game is a tale of how graphic design actually matters a lot.

646
00:33:24,458 --> 00:33:24,920
Speaker 1: A fuck ton.

647
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:28,840
Speaker 1: But I've noticed a lot of people lately, especially Kickstarter games.

648
00:33:29,101 --> 00:33:29,604
Speaker 1: Sorry, Luke.

649
00:33:30,691 --> 00:33:35,379
Speaker 1: Our people are making board games where all they have is graphic design and the game itself.

650
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,880
Speaker 0: My worry is that is almost more disappointing.

651
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:41,160
Speaker 0: For example, Viva Java.

652
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,229
Speaker 0: Haven't reviewed it yet.

653
00:33:42,249 --> 00:33:43,019
Speaker 0: Got to play it again.

654
00:33:43,561 --> 00:33:48,720
Speaker 1: But I worry Java is not that bad compared to a lot of the ones I'm seeing.

655
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,061
Speaker 0: True.

656
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:51,479
Speaker 1: But I saw one that was like beautiful graphic design.

657
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,279
Speaker 1: Roll your dice, move your mice.

658
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:54,698
Speaker 1: And it's like, what the fuck?

659
00:33:55,481 --> 00:33:57,240
Speaker 0: But Glory to Rome had the opposite problem.

660
00:33:57,381 --> 00:33:59,040
Speaker 0: It is actually a pretty great game.

661
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:03,680
Speaker 0: But if you look at this, I mean, pause and click on this link and look at this game.

662
00:34:04,203 --> 00:34:05,599
Speaker 0: This is the kind of game you see.

663
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:07,900
Speaker 0: And then you just your brain just blocks it.

664
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:15,340
Speaker 1: It's the kind of thing that they sell, like on that table next to the counter at the checkout of the game store that never sells even a single copy.

665
00:34:15,601 --> 00:34:15,804
Speaker 0: Yeah.

666
00:34:15,826 --> 00:34:16,619
Speaker 0: Like you look at that.

667
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,760
Speaker 0: You look at the cheap ass game next to it by the cheap.

668
00:34:19,163 --> 00:34:21,279
Speaker 1: To copy three Zune decks.

669
00:34:22,183 --> 00:34:23,312
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

670
00:34:23,373 --> 00:34:24,179
Speaker 0: I remember that.

671
00:34:24,541 --> 00:34:24,782
Speaker 1: Right.

672
00:34:24,842 --> 00:34:27,920
Speaker 1: A copy, an old print of Kobalt's Ate My Baby.

673
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:28,484
Speaker 1: Yeah.

674
00:34:28,565 --> 00:34:29,719
Speaker 1: A cheap ass game.

675
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,998
Speaker 1: Maybe some ice house, some ice house pieces.

676
00:34:32,600 --> 00:34:33,199
Speaker 1: Not anymore, though.

677
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:37,813
Speaker 1: And one of those up and one of those D20s with a D20 inside of it and a D6 with a D6 inside.

678
00:34:41,382 --> 00:34:43,319
Speaker 1: You know, every game store has that little spot.

679
00:34:43,742 --> 00:34:46,277
Speaker 1: Oh, and the the dice bag with the flame pattern on it.

680
00:34:47,802 --> 00:34:52,000
Speaker 0: So the game was ignored by pretty much everyone because it was pretty ugly.

681
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:53,045
Speaker 0: Yeah.

682
00:34:53,085 --> 00:34:54,820
Speaker 1: I don't even know how those copies got distributed.

683
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:55,521
Speaker 1: Right.

684
00:34:55,702 --> 00:34:59,820
Speaker 0: And seeing like trying to play it with that old set, like seeing it laid out.

685
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,440
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of confusing to even play.

686
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:05,400
Speaker 0: It's confusing to play even like it's hard to see what's going on.

687
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:10,900
Speaker 0: So there was a Kickstarter to just make the same game, but beautiful.

688
00:35:11,782 --> 00:35:14,760
Speaker 0: And with a few minor exceptions, like the sewer card.

689
00:35:15,427 --> 00:35:16,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, the sewer card is beautiful.

690
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,280
Speaker 0: It's just very bad graphic design.

691
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:22,720
Speaker 1: Well, bad information design with the words being split up by the water spilling out of the sewer.

692
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:31,020
Speaker 0: There's a few, two different graphic designers we know said the game is beautiful, but it has a few clearly amateurish design mistakes.

693
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's otherwise beautiful.

694
00:35:34,002 --> 00:35:34,939
Speaker 1: Much better than the old one.

695
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:37,299
Speaker 0: It is the exact same game.

696
00:35:37,841 --> 00:35:42,960
Speaker 0: Yet it is amazing because you'll actually play it and it feels good to play.

697
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,091
Speaker 0: It feels clean.

698
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:44,979
Speaker 0: It feels nice.

699
00:35:46,221 --> 00:35:51,068
Speaker 0: So we're the kind of people who always say, yeah, I don't care what the game looks like.

700
00:35:51,351 --> 00:35:52,500
Speaker 0: I only care about the game play.

701
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,437
Speaker 0: And that is true to a point.

702
00:35:54,522 --> 00:36:04,720
Speaker 0: Had I been tricked into playing the old glory to Rome, I probably would have liked it and would have given it a positive review and continued to play it, but it didn't, it wouldn't have felt nice to play.

703
00:36:05,182 --> 00:36:06,836
Speaker 0: There is something to be said for aesthetics.

704
00:36:06,876 --> 00:36:08,899
Speaker 0: For example, playing a Tigris and Euphrates.

705
00:36:09,502 --> 00:36:18,798
Speaker 0: I think a lot is added to it by the graphic design and the way the game is put together and the feeling you get, it feels like an agent game, even though it isn't just because of the way the iconography is.

706
00:36:19,740 --> 00:36:28,707
Speaker 0: So glory to Rome actually kind of a complicated game, but it's interesting because elements in this game are in other games.

707
00:36:29,112 --> 00:36:33,816
Speaker 0: For example, glory to Rome is probably the first game most people would know of.

708
00:36:34,158 --> 00:36:36,720
Speaker 0: that has the mechanic of someone takes an action.

709
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:39,139
Speaker 0: Everyone else either follows or does something else.

710
00:36:39,981 --> 00:36:43,537
Speaker 0: You might notice that from a race for the galaxy or Puerto Rico.

711
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:46,758
Speaker 0: Well, well, you have to follow kind of.

712
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:49,540
Speaker 0: So Puerto Rico is the mechanic of one person chooses an action.

713
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,511
Speaker 0: Everyone else also gets to do the action.

714
00:36:52,135 --> 00:36:53,000
Speaker 0: This is a little different.

715
00:36:53,500 --> 00:37:01,578
Speaker 0: Someone chooses an action and everyone else can either follow and do the same action or think, and then they draw some cards to refill their hand.

716
00:37:01,779 --> 00:37:01,920
Speaker 1: Yep.

717
00:37:02,441 --> 00:37:07,783
Speaker 0: It also has the San Juan mechanic of every card is both card and currency.

718
00:37:07,924 --> 00:37:08,125
Speaker 1: Yup.

719
00:37:08,507 --> 00:37:09,572
Speaker 1: A lot of games have that.

720
00:37:09,653 --> 00:37:10,980
Speaker 0: There are no bits in this game.

721
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,195
Speaker 1: I think World of Warcraft card game does that also.

722
00:37:13,275 --> 00:37:17,940
Speaker 0: if I'm not mistaken, it's a common and often, well, it's, it's an interesting mechanic though.

723
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,029
Speaker 0: It can be done poorly.

724
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:23,511
Speaker 0: And so it is race to the galaxy, but cards do a lot of things in this game.

725
00:37:23,572 --> 00:37:28,419
Speaker 0: Cards are, uh, effectively victory points, but indirectly cards are actions.

726
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:32,563
Speaker 0: Actions can be either played or part of some other part of the game called clientele.

727
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:34,291
Speaker 0: cards are also buildings.

728
00:37:35,114 --> 00:37:36,360
Speaker 0: And here's where the game gets interesting.

729
00:37:36,601 --> 00:37:41,240
Speaker 0: One, the card building powers are almost on the dune level.

730
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:44,697
Speaker 0: It's like you get, you set up this basic are far greater than others.

731
00:37:44,979 --> 00:37:50,657
Speaker 0: Yes, because some are clearly more expensive in there for superior, but it's got the dune situation going on.

732
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:54,970
Speaker 0: So if you, we just described the rules of the game, you'd be like, okay, it's pretty straightforward game.

733
00:37:55,232 --> 00:38:00,040
Speaker 0: I build buildings, then I'd put some stuff in my vault and I do these basic actions and the games really straightforward.

734
00:38:00,881 --> 00:38:08,997
Speaker 0: But then you read the building cards and every card is like break this rule in a way that seems broken lie.

735
00:38:09,057 --> 00:38:09,680
Speaker 0: Here's a good example.

736
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,211
Speaker 0: There's one card called the garden.

737
00:38:11,674 --> 00:38:12,380
Speaker 1: I love the garden.

738
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:15,180
Speaker 0: Not knowing any of the, any of how this game works.

739
00:38:15,561 --> 00:38:22,360
Speaker 0: What the garden says is upon completion, you may take one patron action for each influence you have.

740
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:27,260
Speaker 1: Now keep in mind, as soon as you finish the garden, you get three influence for finishing the garden.

741
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:32,190
Speaker 1: So therefore you're going to take at least three patron actions, if not more immediately.

742
00:38:32,290 --> 00:38:33,940
Speaker 1: I tend to build the garden early in the game.

743
00:38:34,103 --> 00:38:35,020
Speaker 1: I've done it a few times.

744
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,520
Speaker 0: So I built it once late in the game and drew 15 fucking patrons.

745
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,177
Speaker 1: If you have your own patron, the whole game.

746
00:38:40,238 --> 00:38:40,400
Speaker 1: Sure.

747
00:38:41,042 --> 00:38:44,140
Speaker 1: I used it early in the game and it's just five patrons right at the start.

748
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:46,794
Speaker 0: I won that game by like 20 points.

749
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:47,317
Speaker 1: Yeah.

750
00:38:47,518 --> 00:38:49,671
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, how did 15 patrons get in the pool?

751
00:38:49,852 --> 00:38:53,376
Speaker 0: Well, I actually only pulled in, I think 12 or 13, but now the pool was empty.

752
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:53,900
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

753
00:38:53,961 --> 00:38:55,274
Speaker 1: You completely empty that motherfucker.

754
00:38:55,294 --> 00:38:55,840
Speaker 1: Exactly.

755
00:38:56,361 --> 00:38:58,715
Speaker 0: And then I just finished the game with my million actions.

756
00:38:59,077 --> 00:38:59,399
Speaker 1: Of course.

757
00:39:01,381 --> 00:39:11,596
Speaker 0: So that card basically lets you do, you know, imagine if you're playing Puerto Rico and all right, captain nine times, just do it nine times.

758
00:39:11,657 --> 00:39:15,038
Speaker 0: No one else gets to, and they're all like this.

759
00:39:15,821 --> 00:39:22,997
Speaker 0: The really cool thing about this game is that it's actually, despite looks really complicated, like you look at how to play it.

760
00:39:24,082 --> 00:39:29,180
Speaker 0: And there's a reason I'm not explaining how to play the game because without visual aids, it's impossible.

761
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:33,812
Speaker 0: There's no way I'm going to explain it in a way that I can explain the gist, right?

762
00:39:34,442 --> 00:39:37,940
Speaker 1: Is that everyone has cards in their hand and you draw more by thinking, right?

763
00:39:38,481 --> 00:39:42,580
Speaker 1: And you have four, basically there's five different places cards can be.

764
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,969
Speaker 1: They can be, well, I guess the deck, your hand, I guess there's going to be seven already.

765
00:39:47,391 --> 00:39:49,300
Speaker 1: the deck, your hand, right?

766
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:50,407
Speaker 1: The shared deck is.

767
00:39:50,528 --> 00:39:53,760
Speaker 1: the deck is shared the pool, which is this middle of the table area.

768
00:39:54,461 --> 00:40:04,692
Speaker 1: And then on each person will have four other places, which are, uh, influence, uh, their clientele, their stockpile and their vault, right?

769
00:40:05,074 --> 00:40:13,234
Speaker 1: And to score points, you got to get cards to become influenced by building buildings or put them in the vault where they're worth points, our victory points.

770
00:40:14,220 --> 00:40:19,939
Speaker 0: But the other cool thing is that the amount of influence you have limits, how many things can go in your vault, right?

771
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:26,860
Speaker 1: Everything else you are doing is just, you know, with the stockpiles and the client, the clientele is a way to get more actions.

772
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:30,356
Speaker 1: The stockpiles, the way to get more cards out of the pool and into your control.

773
00:40:30,839 --> 00:40:31,020
Speaker 1: Right.

774
00:40:31,761 --> 00:40:33,758
Speaker 1: And to help you build buildings without anyone else.

775
00:40:33,838 --> 00:40:33,980
Speaker 1: Right.

776
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:42,240
Speaker 1: And it's really just how can I build buildings and to get more influenced, to get more stuff in the vault using this machine of card playing.

777
00:40:42,484 --> 00:40:42,580
Speaker 0: Yup.

778
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:49,499
Speaker 0: Now the machine gets a little complicated because it's sort of multi-staged in the sense that for, uh, trying to think of a really good example of this.

779
00:40:49,903 --> 00:40:50,126
Speaker 0: All right.

780
00:40:50,167 --> 00:40:51,159
Speaker 0: So your vault, right?

781
00:40:51,580 --> 00:40:54,280
Speaker 0: You putting stuff in the vault is the captain of this game.

782
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:55,969
Speaker 0: Just put stuff in the vault.

783
00:40:55,989 --> 00:41:01,680
Speaker 0: You just get victory points, just straight up, just tons of victory points, but your vault is limited by your influence.

784
00:41:02,043 --> 00:41:04,919
Speaker 0: You have to build buildings to get more influence, to put more stuff in the vault.

785
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,255
Speaker 0: Yup.

786
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:07,960
Speaker 0: To build buildings, you need to take all these other actions.

787
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:14,920
Speaker 0: So the crank to turn it around in your machine already, it's pretty circuitous and no one else is cranking along with you, right?

788
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:19,044
Speaker 1: Everyone takes turns to choosing what to crank and they're cranking out of sync with you.

789
00:41:19,084 --> 00:41:20,680
Speaker 1: So how do you capitalize on that?

790
00:41:21,080 --> 00:41:28,763
Speaker 0: So rather than get into the depth of how to play the game, I want to just review the game and talk about why it's good and maybe what problems it has.

791
00:41:29,387 --> 00:41:32,759
Speaker 0: Reason number one, why this game is good, or at least interesting.

792
00:41:33,502 --> 00:41:38,411
Speaker 0: It avoids a problem that has bothered me for a long time, but I never had a good way around it.

793
00:41:38,753 --> 00:41:52,810
Speaker 0: I call this problem, I'm gonna give it a long title, when you have to stop the game of power grid, pull out the rules and look up just what the fuck happens in phase three, because nobody remembers the details that happens in so many modern board games.

794
00:41:52,830 --> 00:42:04,020
Speaker 0: You're playing, you're playing, you're playing, but then there's a game phase change or an end of game or a start of game of, uh, how many bits do we put out in a four player version?

795
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:06,272
Speaker 0: Then someone else sits down a five player.

796
00:42:06,353 --> 00:42:07,579
Speaker 0: All right, we need seven more bits.

797
00:42:08,081 --> 00:42:08,282
Speaker 0: Yup.

798
00:42:08,604 --> 00:42:10,070
Speaker 0: This game has none of that.

799
00:42:10,130 --> 00:42:12,240
Speaker 0: There is one piece of setup.

800
00:42:12,541 --> 00:42:13,948
Speaker 0: Every player gets five cards in their hand.

801
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:15,999
Speaker 0: There's a number of sites out.

802
00:42:16,321 --> 00:42:18,232
Speaker 0: It is just equal to the number of players.

803
00:42:18,675 --> 00:42:19,017
Speaker 0: That's it.

804
00:42:19,399 --> 00:42:19,560
Speaker 1: Yup.

805
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:20,639
Speaker 1: No remembering there.

806
00:42:21,301 --> 00:42:24,780
Speaker 0: And you just draw one card for every player in the game and that sets the pool.

807
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:25,183
Speaker 0: That's it.

808
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:26,920
Speaker 0: There is nothing to remember.

809
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:30,798
Speaker 0: The number of players determines every number that matters in the game.

810
00:42:30,818 --> 00:42:30,878
Speaker 1: Yup.

811
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:34,758
Speaker 1: So once you know that and the game ends when it ends immediately.

812
00:42:34,778 --> 00:42:36,131
Speaker 0: Ah, so that's the other piece.

813
00:42:36,435 --> 00:42:36,860
Speaker 0: End game.

814
00:42:37,981 --> 00:42:44,719
Speaker 0: This game gets around the situation of, uh, I almost said around another round and then it's over.

815
00:42:45,101 --> 00:42:46,186
Speaker 1: So I drew the last card.

816
00:42:46,206 --> 00:42:47,090
Speaker 1: I drew the last card.

817
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,449
Speaker 0: Does the game end immediately?

818
00:42:50,469 --> 00:42:51,600
Speaker 0: I built the last building.

819
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:53,229
Speaker 0: Do we finish the round?

820
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:58,560
Speaker 0: Uh, so I drew, I can't finish the auction phase, but there's none of that.

821
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:00,310
Speaker 0: This game fucking ends.

822
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:04,778
Speaker 0: When I say fucking ends, it ends in a catastrophic fashion.

823
00:43:04,818 --> 00:43:12,500
Speaker 0: The game, if you draw the last card from the deck at any point, the game immediately ends immediately is an interrupt.

824
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:15,120
Speaker 0: The likes of which I've never seen in games before.

825
00:43:15,601 --> 00:43:19,488
Speaker 1: So there is basically no question as, well, I mean, Netrunner has the same game ending.

826
00:43:19,548 --> 00:43:20,131
Speaker 1: interrupt, right?

827
00:43:20,152 --> 00:43:20,413
Speaker 1: True.

828
00:43:20,574 --> 00:43:21,580
Speaker 1: You get seven points.

829
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:23,793
Speaker 1: Jinteki doesn't do a damage for that score.

830
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:24,880
Speaker 1: You win and you get seven points.

831
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:25,385
Speaker 1: Game over.

832
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:25,771
Speaker 1: Boom.

833
00:43:25,852 --> 00:43:26,075
Speaker 1: Right?

834
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:26,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

835
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,654
Speaker 0: Scott plays the legionary action instead of following.

836
00:43:29,735 --> 00:43:30,940
Speaker 0: I think I draw the last cards.

837
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,129
Speaker 0: No more actions happen.

838
00:43:32,149 --> 00:43:32,876
Speaker 0: We just score.

839
00:43:32,896 --> 00:43:32,956
Speaker 0: Yup.

840
00:43:33,840 --> 00:43:39,991
Speaker 0: So another way the game ends is if you build the last sort of in town sites, buildings go on top of sites.

841
00:43:40,052 --> 00:43:41,100
Speaker 0: This is cool mechanic there.

842
00:43:42,442 --> 00:43:48,274
Speaker 0: So the rule book even points out if this occurs, there is no possible way to finish that building.

843
00:43:48,757 --> 00:43:49,260
Speaker 1: Of course not.

844
00:43:49,540 --> 00:43:51,293
Speaker 0: Because there are no more actions to take.

845
00:43:51,314 --> 00:43:52,140
Speaker 0: The game ends immediately.

846
00:43:52,921 --> 00:43:54,491
Speaker 0: There is a building, a card.

847
00:43:54,531 --> 00:43:57,283
Speaker 0: There are multiple of them in the deck, the catacombs.

848
00:43:57,364 --> 00:44:00,359
Speaker 0: If anyone builds it, the game immediately ends.

849
00:44:01,684 --> 00:44:05,979
Speaker 1: And there's another card, the Forum Romanum, the best card that I've tried twice and got close once.

850
00:44:06,820 --> 00:44:11,354
Speaker 0: So the Forum Romanum, if you all know, there's one other end game condition before I talk about.

851
00:44:11,375 --> 00:44:12,597
Speaker 0: the Forum Romanum is in the book.

852
00:44:13,182 --> 00:44:20,598
Speaker 0: If all players agree unanimously to surrender the game to a single player for any reason at any time, that's in there for whatever reason.

853
00:44:20,859 --> 00:44:23,822
Speaker 1: Well, I guess someone could just start running away with it and you don't want to finish it.

854
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:24,163
Speaker 0: Yeah.

855
00:44:24,967 --> 00:44:31,720
Speaker 0: So the Forum Romanum, if anyone builds this, and again, there are multiple of them and all of these conditions are true simultaneously.

856
00:44:32,143 --> 00:44:33,759
Speaker 0: It is a completed building in front of them.

857
00:44:34,602 --> 00:44:36,780
Speaker 0: They have one of every type of card in their clientele.

858
00:44:37,080 --> 00:44:39,040
Speaker 0: They have one of every type of card in their stock pile.

859
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:41,208
Speaker 0: They immediately win.

860
00:44:41,489 --> 00:44:42,855
Speaker 0: The game immediately ends.

861
00:44:42,955 --> 00:44:44,160
Speaker 0: Scores do not matter.

862
00:44:46,061 --> 00:44:48,579
Speaker 0: Reason number three, why this game is actually pretty cool.

863
00:44:49,680 --> 00:44:55,880
Speaker 0: The game is set such that the number of things you need to finish a building is equal to the victory points.

864
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,694
Speaker 0: That thing is worth and the colors all line up.

865
00:44:58,895 --> 00:45:00,804
Speaker 0: And if you play the game, you'll see what I mean.

866
00:45:01,366 --> 00:45:02,592
Speaker 0: Everything lines up.

867
00:45:03,094 --> 00:45:04,360
Speaker 0: Every number makes sense.

868
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:07,620
Speaker 0: You don't have to think about anything except how you're trying to win.

869
00:45:08,162 --> 00:45:12,660
Speaker 0: Like all the numbers of nouns of things to put in things is just so intuitive.

870
00:45:13,660 --> 00:45:19,025
Speaker 0: And the last reason why the game is great beyond all that is that scoring is dead simple.

871
00:45:19,106 --> 00:45:20,094
Speaker 0: The game ends and just up.

872
00:45:20,134 --> 00:45:20,618
Speaker 0: That's the score.

873
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,254
Speaker 0: Scoring takes basically zero time.

874
00:45:24,435 --> 00:45:25,360
Speaker 1: You count your influence.

875
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:26,880
Speaker 1: You count the number of points in your vault.

876
00:45:27,162 --> 00:45:29,839
Speaker 1: You hand out these bonus cards to whoever earns them.

877
00:45:30,202 --> 00:45:33,299
Speaker 1: And then you add three points to ever got a bonus card per bonus card.

878
00:45:33,702 --> 00:45:45,120
Speaker 0: Now in terms of game plan, winning the game, I've won almost every game of it I've played since we played it with our friend Pete and his associated crew who were playing it wrong the entire time.

879
00:45:45,444 --> 00:45:45,956
Speaker 0: They own the game.

880
00:45:45,977 --> 00:45:46,059
Speaker 1: Yep.

881
00:45:46,441 --> 00:45:48,513
Speaker 0: I read the rules once and realized they were playing wrong.

882
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:51,380
Speaker 0: I feel bad for them, but that's how the cookie crumbles.

883
00:45:52,600 --> 00:46:00,818
Speaker 0: But I win a lot and I got the opportunity at nerd NYC last week to teach the game to a bunch of people who never played it before, never even heard of it.

884
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,879
Speaker 0: I was playing net runner and play it with them multiple times.

885
00:46:06,282 --> 00:46:08,999
Speaker 0: And it was interesting because it was a smart group who took their turn.

886
00:46:09,761 --> 00:46:12,094
Speaker 0: And the first round I ran away with the game.

887
00:46:12,114 --> 00:46:13,160
Speaker 0: Like it was just pointless.

888
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:15,680
Speaker 0: I just won, but I didn't even have to do anything.

889
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:18,899
Speaker 0: The second game was super close and I didn't win.

890
00:46:19,823 --> 00:46:24,117
Speaker 0: So after that initial learning phase, people who are smart pick the game up right away.

891
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:28,817
Speaker 0: But the end game strategies I think are very complex.

892
00:46:28,878 --> 00:46:44,432
Speaker 0: This game, if I had to say probably breaks down like a dominion in the sense that based on the set of cards that people have in their initial hands and the flow of cards into their hands, you're trying to come up with the most efficient machine

893
00:46:44,955 --> 00:46:45,799
Speaker 1: simultaneously

894
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:50,300
Speaker 0: trying to deny and hurt other people's strategies based on the machines they're making.

895
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:51,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

896
00:46:51,601 --> 00:47:00,520
Speaker 1: One thing that I only thought of doing since I've last played the game is I realized the true power, the games I've played in the legionary was not used much.

897
00:47:01,302 --> 00:47:01,463
Speaker 1: Right.

898
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:04,540
Speaker 1: And I was trying to think, well, why wasn't the legionary used very much?

899
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:04,882
Speaker 1: Right.

900
00:47:04,922 --> 00:47:07,402
Speaker 1: You know, it's like people, you know, should, you know, everyone.

901
00:47:07,423 --> 00:47:09,160
Speaker 1: just just labor and craft and architect.

902
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:10,471
Speaker 0: See I don't, I lesion a lot.

903
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:11,380
Speaker 0: Legionary forgot.

904
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,760
Speaker 1: Because people want to build their buildings, right?

905
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:18,755
Speaker 1: So they keep choosing architect, labor and craftsmen.

906
00:47:18,796 --> 00:47:25,057
Speaker 1: And I realized, no, what you have to do is if the people around you are doing better than you and you're getting behind, right?

907
00:47:25,721 --> 00:47:30,686
Speaker 1: If you try to build a buildings with those actions, you're also going to build, you're helping them build buildings.

908
00:47:31,068 --> 00:47:35,368
Speaker 1: Legionnaire is the, it's a, it's, it's a catch up action.

909
00:47:35,388 --> 00:47:37,320
Speaker 1: The people don't realize a catch up action.

910
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:41,620
Speaker 1: What you do with legionary is you don't see, and here's the other mistake.

911
00:47:41,681 --> 00:47:47,810
Speaker 1: People took legionary and they, they looked at the buildings they were trying to build and asked for that resource.

912
00:47:47,850 --> 00:47:49,620
Speaker 0: Other people are trying to look at the buildings.

913
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,800
Speaker 1: The other people are building.

914
00:47:51,141 --> 00:47:56,084
Speaker 1: You asked for that resource to come on over to fuck them from building their buildings.

915
00:47:56,205 --> 00:47:57,760
Speaker 1: That's what the legionaries about.

916
00:47:58,120 --> 00:48:00,111
Speaker 1: Legionary basically people.

917
00:48:00,192 --> 00:48:01,600
Speaker 1: It's not obvious to do that.

918
00:48:01,922 --> 00:48:03,260
Speaker 0: This is another reason why I like this game.

919
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:09,668
Speaker 0: Anytime games present rituals or things you're supposed to say or do in the course of the game, that makes sense.

920
00:48:09,728 --> 00:48:10,552
Speaker 0: I generally like it.

921
00:48:10,994 --> 00:48:12,120
Speaker 0: and glory to Rome.

922
00:48:12,620 --> 00:48:23,480
Speaker 0: people who play the game will always be like Rome demands, you know, blow jobs because if you play legionary, you go around clockwise, every religion takes their hand, puts one card from their hand face up.

923
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:26,618
Speaker 0: You got to have the thing in your hand to demand it.

924
00:48:26,779 --> 00:48:26,920
Speaker 1: Yeah.

925
00:48:26,940 --> 00:48:32,295
Speaker 1: You got to say like this, you people who don't speak Roman, put it down and say these see what this is.

926
00:48:34,181 --> 00:48:42,490
Speaker 0: And any player who does not have that thing in their hand simply is instructed to say glory to Rome.

927
00:48:43,173 --> 00:48:44,720
Speaker 0: I have nothing to offer Rome but glory.

928
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:45,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

929
00:48:45,041 --> 00:48:47,699
Speaker 1: Rome comes over and points at a pile of rocks and says, give me those.

930
00:48:48,142 --> 00:48:49,469
Speaker 1: And Rome demands a rubble.

931
00:48:49,550 --> 00:48:51,380
Speaker 1: And they say, there's no rubble around here.

932
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:52,183
Speaker 1: Glory to Rome.

933
00:48:52,887 --> 00:48:55,540
Speaker 1: And I'm usually, we just say, Rome, go fuck itself.

934
00:48:55,860 --> 00:48:56,684
Speaker 1: Fuck you Rome.

935
00:48:56,965 --> 00:49:01,408
Speaker 0: The game encourages the sort of, you know, renaming things.

936
00:49:01,993 --> 00:49:05,900
Speaker 0: I noticed I started, I just said to Blutem every time we reset the pool.

937
00:49:06,563 --> 00:49:11,083
Speaker 0: And not only did no one blink at that, but they all understood exactly what I meant because they'd all played Puerto Rico before.

938
00:49:11,284 --> 00:49:11,464
Speaker 1: Yep.

939
00:49:13,233 --> 00:49:14,399
Speaker 0: There's one problem with this game.

940
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:16,149
Speaker 0: This is a few.

941
00:49:16,189 --> 00:49:17,460
Speaker 0: Well, here's the biggest problem.

942
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:22,889
Speaker 0: Remember way back and we told everyone how sanctuary and Eagle are these great manga, but all you can't buy them.

943
00:49:23,432 --> 00:49:24,640
Speaker 0: You can't buy glory to Rome.

944
00:49:25,761 --> 00:49:26,525
Speaker 0: Glory to Rome.

945
00:49:26,887 --> 00:49:29,380
Speaker 0: This new re-released awesome version was a Kickstarter.

946
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:33,720
Speaker 0: And as far as I can tell, there's basically no way to get it unless you kickstarted it.

947
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:40,148
Speaker 0: I bought it at a significant premium from someone who got it in the Kickstarter on Amazon.

948
00:49:40,713 --> 00:49:44,440
Speaker 1: Second hand, you might be able to get one at eBay or who knows, right?

949
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:45,530
Speaker 1: Something like check the eBay.

950
00:49:45,550 --> 00:49:46,339
Speaker 1: See if there's any on there.

951
00:49:46,561 --> 00:49:50,326
Speaker 1: You also might be able to buy the original version with the shitty graphic design.

952
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:59,897
Speaker 0: You may be also, there are three available right now on Amazon for 60, $75 each plus significant shipping.

953
00:50:00,178 --> 00:50:00,360
Speaker 1: Yeah.

954
00:50:01,041 --> 00:50:03,975
Speaker 1: So I guess it's possible to get it if you have dollars.

955
00:50:04,578 --> 00:50:08,753
Speaker 0: No, one of these says plastic shell version.

956
00:50:08,853 --> 00:50:09,897
Speaker 0: No, no.

957
00:50:09,917 --> 00:50:10,520
Speaker 0: I want that one.

958
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:11,873
Speaker 0: You want the black one?

959
00:50:11,893 --> 00:50:12,540
Speaker 0: That's right.

960
00:50:12,781 --> 00:50:14,391
Speaker 0: I'll link to a picture of the good and bad one.

961
00:50:14,411 --> 00:50:15,700
Speaker 0: So you can't mess this up.

962
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:16,425
Speaker 1: You want to get the one.

963
00:50:16,465 --> 00:50:17,975
Speaker 1: that looks like it's a Nazi game.

964
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:18,660
Speaker 1: That's the one.

965
00:50:18,840 --> 00:50:19,744
Speaker 1: That's the good one.

966
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:21,671
Speaker 0: Sadly, I'm in a Roman game.

967
00:50:22,675 --> 00:50:25,912
Speaker 1: The black box looks, these guys are frigging Nazi Eagle on the front.

968
00:50:25,932 --> 00:50:27,200
Speaker 0: It's not a Nazi Eagle.

969
00:50:27,320 --> 00:50:31,780
Speaker 1: It's a Roman Eagle, uh, was a Ridge with the Nazi stole it from the Romans.

970
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:35,799
Speaker 1: So anyway, and it doesn't help that he's got a red flag under him.

971
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:49,543
Speaker 0: So other problems with the game are that it's really fun, but the actual directional heuristics in this game from playing competently to playing well against experts are incredibly obtuse.

972
00:50:50,126 --> 00:50:54,279
Speaker 0: Uh, I think I've got a handle on a few of them, but I haven't played enough to be sure.

973
00:50:55,061 --> 00:51:08,282
Speaker 0: And I'm not sure how deep that rabbit hole goes, but I've noticed that counting cards doesn't matter that much because the deck is huge, but paying attention to which cards have come out or not is a big deal.

974
00:51:08,744 --> 00:51:15,139
Speaker 0: If you know that all three catacombs were used as materials early on, then you don't have to worry about the game ending early.

975
00:51:16,041 --> 00:51:19,945
Speaker 0: Cause there are ways to set up a combo, lay down a catacomb and finish it in all one go.

976
00:51:19,985 --> 00:51:20,167
Speaker 1: Right.

977
00:51:20,207 --> 00:51:21,560
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, think about this, right?

978
00:51:21,640 --> 00:51:25,220
Speaker 1: You can build a stone building early catacombs only cost three to right.

979
00:51:25,481 --> 00:51:26,432
Speaker 1: I built gardens early.

980
00:51:26,452 --> 00:51:27,180
Speaker 1: So why not a catacomb?

981
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:29,400
Speaker 0: I've seen people win the game with five victory points.

982
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:30,759
Speaker 0: They just build the catacombs right away.

983
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:40,079
Speaker 1: So if you do an early merchant before anyone else, and then you do a catacombs, the catacombs is three points and the merchant puts you ahead of everyone else, probably by at least three points.

984
00:51:40,281 --> 00:51:48,883
Speaker 0: But if you see someone start to build the catacombs just immediately and you merchant, you're basically preventing them from finishing the catacomb cause they'll you lose.

985
00:51:49,165 --> 00:51:51,036
Speaker 0: Cause you might have more, you will have more points.

986
00:51:51,097 --> 00:51:51,560
Speaker 0: Probably.

987
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,140
Speaker 1: Maybe depends how much you merchant.

988
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:54,544
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter.

989
00:51:54,604 --> 00:52:00,758
Speaker 0: Cause even if you merchant a wood with that three point bonus, revving the most wood, you'll have four extra victory points instead of his three extra.

990
00:52:00,939 --> 00:52:04,840
Speaker 1: Well, ideally you would remember what he merchant did and merchant two of whatever.

991
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:09,640
Speaker 0: Probably if he's trying to blitz catacomb, he hasn't merged into Dick cause he's trying to just finish as quick as possible.

992
00:52:09,881 --> 00:52:10,203
Speaker 1: Maybe.

993
00:52:10,826 --> 00:52:11,147
Speaker 1: Maybe.

994
00:52:11,388 --> 00:52:11,690
Speaker 1: Yeah.

995
00:52:12,835 --> 00:52:13,217
Speaker 1: Tough call.

996
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:13,880
Speaker 0: I don't know.

997
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:14,710
Speaker 0: It's a pretty fun game.

998
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:19,760
Speaker 0: Uh, I'm surprised at how quick it is to teach and how quick it is to play.

999
00:52:19,921 --> 00:52:29,940
Speaker 1: Like I'm actually really surprised considering how you think like it's a, you think you look at it and like, this is gonna be pretty confusing to a lot of people, but people sort of get it actually relatively quickly to what you would expect.

1000
00:52:30,220 --> 00:52:35,004
Speaker 0: So Scott, so the play sheets are really well designed, but what Scott uses, there's two sides.

1001
00:52:35,125 --> 00:52:36,980
Speaker 0: One side just summarizes what he'd action does.

1002
00:52:37,462 --> 00:52:41,363
Speaker 0: And one side shows this really complex over engineered diagram of the flows of cards.

1003
00:52:41,766 --> 00:52:43,098
Speaker 1: The card, the chart is way better.

1004
00:52:43,138 --> 00:52:43,280
Speaker 0: Yes.

1005
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:46,080
Speaker 0: One in five people think that Scott's side is better.

1006
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:48,780
Speaker 0: Every time I run this game for people, it's always five players.

1007
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:53,840
Speaker 0: One dude puts that side face up and everyone else puts the other side face up.

1008
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:57,800
Speaker 1: Chart side is way better cause it should, cause the cards are in different places and that side.

1009
00:52:57,840 --> 00:52:59,480
Speaker 0: How many games of glory to Rome have you won?

1010
00:52:59,660 --> 00:53:01,820
Speaker 1: Shows you arrows from which place they go to.

1011
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,272
Speaker 1: What does that have to do with which side is better?

1012
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:06,920
Speaker 0: So, uh, I wonder if that side is seeding your brain in a poor way.

1013
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,768
Speaker 1: Maybe the pro?

1014
00:53:08,788 --> 00:53:15,520
Speaker 1: the real problem with glory to Rome is that the, there is a large random card element, right?

1015
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:22,634
Speaker 1: Like you could draw some awesome buildings at the beginning and also the cards required to build them and to play them.

1016
00:53:22,735 --> 00:53:23,359
Speaker 1: It could just happen.

1017
00:53:23,581 --> 00:53:25,600
Speaker 1: And then you're going to get off to a great start.

1018
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:33,043
Speaker 0: And the thing is it gets around that by, there aren't really direct paths to building buildings and finishing them from your hand.

1019
00:53:33,345 --> 00:53:34,855
Speaker 0: There's one action that does that.

1020
00:53:34,916 --> 00:53:38,100
Speaker 0: The craftsman, you had to be able to effectively crank your machine.

1021
00:53:38,220 --> 00:53:39,680
Speaker 0: You gotta be building from multiple sources.

1022
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:46,294
Speaker 0: So you need to get materials, not just from your handout, but into your stockpile and then, yeah, cause someone else might pick architect.

1023
00:53:46,314 --> 00:53:46,940
Speaker 1: and then what do you do?

1024
00:53:47,080 --> 00:53:50,380
Speaker 0: Think and the pool is only refilled by the actions you're taking.

1025
00:53:50,540 --> 00:53:54,400
Speaker 0: So there are actually really complex directional heuristics around.

1026
00:53:54,921 --> 00:54:04,904
Speaker 0: Do I lead merchant because I want to do the merchant action or do I lead merchant with two other cards to be a wildcard cause I don't want any stone to go into the pool.

1027
00:54:05,064 --> 00:54:05,325
Speaker 1: Yep.

1028
00:54:07,495 --> 00:54:14,480
Speaker 0: Uh, the more, you know, the moral of this review is if you can get a hold of this game and you're a gamer, it's a gamer's game.

1029
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:20,028
Speaker 0: This is a great game to whip out with other tabletop gamers because one, they doesn't take that long.

1030
00:54:20,088 --> 00:54:21,397
Speaker 1: It doesn't take up a lot of space.

1031
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:21,800
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1032
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:23,640
Speaker 0: One that you can just play it quickly.

1033
00:54:24,101 --> 00:54:25,971
Speaker 0: Actually it takes up more space than you'd expect.

1034
00:54:26,373 --> 00:54:27,740
Speaker 1: I mean space in the box.

1035
00:54:27,900 --> 00:54:28,161
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

1036
00:54:28,483 --> 00:54:31,680
Speaker 0: But two, most people are not going to have this game.

1037
00:54:31,781 --> 00:54:34,780
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of novelty and you can teach it quickly.

1038
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:41,302
Speaker 0: And if you whip this out at a board gamer party, it's going to get played all night because people just don't have access to it right now.

1039
00:54:41,363 --> 00:54:43,037
Speaker 1: And people like saying glory to Rome.

1040
00:54:43,098 --> 00:54:43,279
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1041
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:44,946
Speaker 0: The game's just really fun.

1042
00:54:44,987 --> 00:54:48,632
Speaker 0: And I seen if you're a board gamer of any Stripe, this is just one of those games you should own.

1043
00:54:48,934 --> 00:54:49,075
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1044
00:54:49,217 --> 00:54:49,559
Speaker 0: Straight up.

1045
00:54:49,780 --> 00:55:04,440
Speaker 0: I unqualifiedly say that you should own it even though I'm pretty sure it's going to break down far more rapidly than say Puerto Rico under like some all time great game, but it is a game that you should play.

1046
00:55:10,070 --> 00:55:12,230
