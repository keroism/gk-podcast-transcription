8
00:00:40,264 --> 00:00:40,405
Speaker 1: Well.

9
00:00:40,425 --> 00:00:41,610
Speaker 1: No I'm working from home.

10
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:45,288
Speaker 0: It's the best thing ever except aren't you working the night shift from home?

11
00:00:45,469 --> 00:00:53,338
Speaker 1: well I am but last week I was working the day shift from home, and I got to say working the day shift from home is perhaps The greatest thing in the world.

12
00:00:53,378 --> 00:00:55,972
Speaker 1: I mean you know I used to have a very sure no It's been all.

13
00:00:55,992 --> 00:00:56,173
Speaker 0: you know.

14
00:00:56,193 --> 00:00:56,796
Speaker 0: it's a lot greater.

15
00:00:56,816 --> 00:01:02,084
Speaker 0: not working and just traveling wherever the hell you want Yeah, but I have to work right now at least though.

16
00:01:02,506 --> 00:01:06,643
Speaker 1: I think I have enough money I could quit and live for a while before I eventually starve to death.

17
00:01:07,285 --> 00:01:08,450
Speaker 0: the thing is I've been thinking lately.

18
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:11,320
Speaker 0: It's like hey, let's say I don't know.

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,869
Speaker 0: I went to the doctor, and they told me I had like a year to live.

20
00:01:13,929 --> 00:01:14,755
Speaker 0: right What would I do?

21
00:01:14,775 --> 00:01:16,950
Speaker 0: I travel the world for you be like whatever?

22
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,695
Speaker 0: But I could.

23
00:01:18,997 --> 00:01:21,330
Speaker 0: that means that if I could do that you could do that anyway.

24
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,336
Speaker 1: I could do that anyway.

25
00:01:22,456 --> 00:01:24,145
Speaker 1: at the end of that you'll have no assets.

26
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:24,769
Speaker 1: It'll be indigent.

27
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,414
Speaker 0: What's indigent me?

28
00:01:26,575 --> 00:01:27,599
Speaker 1: no no assets?

29
00:01:28,081 --> 00:01:28,844
Speaker 1: What do I do then?

30
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:29,527
Speaker 1: I don't know.

31
00:01:29,567 --> 00:01:30,310
Speaker 1: starve in the street.

32
00:01:30,971 --> 00:01:33,365
Speaker 0: There's no way to unindigent get some money.

33
00:01:33,405 --> 00:01:34,150
Speaker 0: I have skills.

34
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:40,568
Speaker 1: I mean you'll probably have a bunch of debt chasing you because obviously if you you know if you were going to die You're gonna travel the world.

35
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:49,021
Speaker 0: Credit cards pay for everything all right, so what if I travel the world and then I get back and the doctors like oh wait Actually, you're not gonna die.

36
00:01:49,101 --> 00:01:49,970
Speaker 1: that has happened.

37
00:01:50,251 --> 00:01:51,055
Speaker 1: And there was a case.

38
00:01:51,175 --> 00:01:55,655
Speaker 1: it was on FARC a couple years ago where a guy was told that he had like a year to Live terminal illness.

39
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:59,590
Speaker 1: so he like sold his house and spent all his money and like lived the life of his dream.

40
00:01:59,631 --> 00:02:00,629
Speaker 0: And then he was a homeless bum.

41
00:02:01,631 --> 00:02:04,184
Speaker 1: He sued the doctor an idea.

42
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:05,290
Speaker 0: doctors got money.

43
00:02:05,553 --> 00:02:06,908
Speaker 1: I don't I don't know what came of it.

44
00:02:07,413 --> 00:02:09,169
Speaker 0: Hopefully you just get the doctor to pay off the debt.

45
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,154
Speaker 0: Then you can get a job.

46
00:02:10,175 --> 00:02:11,139
Speaker 1: me here's the problem.

47
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:17,009
Speaker 1: if he got all of it taken care of You realize the obvious scam is you work with a doctor?

48
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,549
Speaker 1: To diagnose you and then you guys have a party.

49
00:02:21,331 --> 00:02:26,870
Speaker 0: Anyway, no you know why you wouldn't do that because what would have you know what it happens, then it's now insurance fraud.

50
00:02:27,393 --> 00:02:29,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, insurance fraud is very lucrative.

51
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:33,209
Speaker 0: I guess Unless you're uninsured.

52
00:02:34,032 --> 00:02:35,497
Speaker 0: But then who are you gonna get money from?

53
00:02:35,637 --> 00:02:40,252
Speaker 1: well if you're uninsured by definition you cannot be party to insurance fraud I know.

54
00:02:40,272 --> 00:02:50,129
Speaker 0: but then you also cannot be party to a bunch of money to help you go around the world Unless you are the guy who sets the house on fire to precipitate the insurance fraud.

55
00:02:51,114 --> 00:02:52,584
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, then you get paid and you're.

56
00:02:52,644 --> 00:02:53,450
Speaker 0: then you're an arsonist.

57
00:02:55,154 --> 00:02:56,309
Speaker 1: You'll be good at arson.

58
00:02:57,713 --> 00:03:03,550
Speaker 1: Anyway, but having all this free time I've been working European banking hours this week, and I've been doing it from home.

59
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:09,114
Speaker 1: He's a bank holiday I would have but there weren't any bank holidays while I was doing the European shift.

60
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:09,857
Speaker 0: is it?

61
00:03:09,897 --> 00:03:11,944
Speaker 0: is it all of Europe or just UK or what?

62
00:03:12,245 --> 00:03:13,450
Speaker 1: well it's complicated.

63
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:16,079
Speaker 1: You know our our operation is based in bank holidays.

64
00:03:16,099 --> 00:03:16,982
Speaker 0: They're only in London's.

65
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:18,889
Speaker 1: I think well no, but the stock UK?

66
00:03:19,852 --> 00:03:22,399
Speaker 1: The complicated answer is that there was a bank holiday.

67
00:03:22,419 --> 00:03:22,881
Speaker 1: that happened.

68
00:03:22,901 --> 00:03:29,290
Speaker 1: that was only UK so our people took the day off But the rest of the European markets were active, so it was this complicated.

69
00:03:29,792 --> 00:03:34,488
Speaker 1: We're still figuring out how to handle that mmm, but working from home a lot of free time.

70
00:03:34,528 --> 00:03:35,030
Speaker 1: What am I doing?

71
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,081
Speaker 1: I'm watching the space train.

72
00:03:37,403 --> 00:03:41,079
Speaker 0: Oh space train already finished I'm you know I ever think about it.

73
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,989
Speaker 0: space trains like a hundred and what 17 episodes something like that.

74
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:48,510
Speaker 0: There aren't too many people in the history of the universe who have seen the whole thing.

75
00:03:48,670 --> 00:03:52,302
Speaker 0: I've said this probably hundreds of people who've seen the whole thing and I'm one of them.

76
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:53,727
Speaker 0: every single episode.

77
00:03:53,767 --> 00:03:57,485
Speaker 1: Holy shit You know watch every lazy Matsumoto everything.

78
00:03:57,525 --> 00:03:58,450
Speaker 0: That's just impossible.

79
00:04:00,514 --> 00:04:01,827
Speaker 0: Like zero people who've done that.

80
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:04,635
Speaker 0: Samoto is among the zero people.

81
00:04:04,656 --> 00:04:10,595
Speaker 1: man at some point has to die and as long as he dies before you you could Theoretically watch it all.

82
00:04:11,197 --> 00:04:13,405
Speaker 0: yeah, I guess it takes less time to watch and it takes to make.

83
00:04:13,445 --> 00:04:14,308
Speaker 0: and they made it all.

84
00:04:14,448 --> 00:04:25,845
Speaker 1: so Yeah, but one thing I got to say you know I watch like the whole beginning And I watched like all these rent like 20 or so episodes all through the middle And now I'm watching like the last 15 episodes.

85
00:04:26,448 --> 00:04:34,089
Speaker 1: and one thing I got to say you know Matsumoto lays on the melodrama pretty thick but as we always say he's the only man in the world Who can do it with a straight face?

86
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:45,230
Speaker 1: But he's really laying it on thick like that episode where there are two Galaxy Express three nines I was a good Mattel's and two well one Tetsuro and one other guy.

87
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,925
Speaker 0: And then they don't even let you know if the mix-up was actually a mix-up or not.

88
00:04:49,266 --> 00:04:53,362
Speaker 0: They're just like yeah It's alright bitches ah and they throw in in that episode.

89
00:04:53,382 --> 00:04:57,730
Speaker 1: They throw that whole side story of yeah There's also a world with the cyborgs of the good guys.

90
00:04:59,577 --> 00:05:00,308
Speaker 0: Yep, that's a good one.

91
00:05:00,611 --> 00:05:07,873
Speaker 1: But there's like this five-minute scene of people saying goodbye to each other and that was like the most melodrama in the whole series As far as I can tell.

92
00:05:08,636 --> 00:05:10,142
Speaker 0: I know captain Harlock.

93
00:05:10,222 --> 00:05:10,925
Speaker 0: He can lay it out.

94
00:05:10,945 --> 00:05:11,487
Speaker 0: I'm pretty heavy.

95
00:05:11,527 --> 00:05:13,999
Speaker 0: well that series I mean it was an episode with captain heart.

96
00:05:14,019 --> 00:05:16,150
Speaker 0: it was but that's actually a three-parter.

97
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:19,450
Speaker 1: But that three-parter couldn't be nearly as melodramatic as Arcadia.

98
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,575
Speaker 0: Did you not watch the three-parter?

99
00:05:20,595 --> 00:05:21,278
Speaker 1: I did not.

100
00:05:21,299 --> 00:05:22,826
Speaker 0: I'll have to tell you which episodes those are.

101
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:23,790
Speaker 1: I'll go back and watch that shit.

102
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:27,850
Speaker 1: I love me some Harlock all right, but we'll probably review Galaxy Express.

103
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:30,662
Speaker 1: We just have to watch the movie again, and I have to finish watching the end of the show.

104
00:05:30,682 --> 00:05:32,048
Speaker 0: Yeah it needs to be a big movie showing going on.

105
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe Sunday after the game.

106
00:05:34,739 --> 00:05:36,285
Speaker 1: We're playing you know burning wheel this weekend.

107
00:05:36,346 --> 00:05:37,430
Speaker 0: I don't know about Sunday.

108
00:05:37,430 --> 00:05:39,945
Speaker 1: Yeah, the problem is we started like 10.

109
00:05:39,945 --> 00:05:43,357
Speaker 1: Yeah, right We'll see anyway.

110
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,743
Speaker 1: What do you got for me?

111
00:05:45,085 --> 00:05:46,290
Speaker 0: What do I have for you?

112
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,739
Speaker 0: Well, you know there isn't really news.

113
00:05:48,799 --> 00:05:50,385
Speaker 0: well actually there is one big news.

114
00:05:50,405 --> 00:05:51,690
Speaker 1: There's the obligatory.

115
00:05:51,971 --> 00:05:57,470
Speaker 0: There's no more anime industry blah blah blah blah, but yeah, and you know comic news is usually pretty uninteresting.

116
00:05:57,470 --> 00:06:02,150
Speaker 0: It's usually like a new series from so-and-so or you know up so-and-so canceled.

117
00:06:02,371 --> 00:06:05,650
Speaker 0: It's not like this big happenings too often in the world of comics.

118
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:13,423
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna continue my trend of doing geek bites in the Wednesday news slot And I'll continue this trend with this book here.

119
00:06:14,227 --> 00:06:18,138
Speaker 0: It's Marvel 1985. it's let's see it's $20.

120
00:06:18,138 --> 00:06:22,235
Speaker 0: I didn't pay $20 And I don't.

121
00:06:22,296 --> 00:06:29,405
Speaker 0: it's not really thick enough to be $20 worth, but anyway This is uh you remember the Marvel 1602 by Neil Gaiman.

122
00:06:29,706 --> 00:06:30,830
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that was actually pretty good.

123
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:31,735
Speaker 0: That was actually very good.

124
00:06:31,755 --> 00:06:32,158
Speaker 1: I liked it.

125
00:06:32,379 --> 00:06:35,734
Speaker 0: This is not as good But it's okay.

126
00:06:36,055 --> 00:06:37,398
Speaker 0: basically the deal is right.

127
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,004
Speaker 0: is is 1985 in the United States.

128
00:06:40,345 --> 00:06:42,270
Speaker 0: I forget exactly where maybe, California.

129
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:55,109
Speaker 0: I forget it's basically a suburban Somewhat rural type of place and as a kid with divorced parents and he goes to live with his dad or whatever and There's a weird house in the woods that you know something's going on there.

130
00:06:55,893 --> 00:06:58,583
Speaker 0: I'm basically you know the kid thinks he's insane.

131
00:06:58,663 --> 00:06:59,607
Speaker 0: cuz like he sees dr.

132
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:04,939
Speaker 0: Doom at the house and You know sure enough right the kid.

133
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,343
Speaker 0: You know at first.

134
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:07,607
Speaker 1: It's not insane and dr.

135
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:15,657
Speaker 0: Doom is at the house yeah, and so pretty much all the Marvel bad guys are at this house and They're totally real just hanging out playing poker.

136
00:07:15,957 --> 00:07:20,268
Speaker 0: no eventually they just start devastating everything on purpose in a smart way.

137
00:07:20,288 --> 00:07:21,456
Speaker 1: man Look at dr.

138
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:21,698
Speaker 1: Doom.

139
00:07:21,718 --> 00:07:22,890
Speaker 1: He's devastating everyone.

140
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:27,108
Speaker 0: They just kept like they were going out in a radius from this house just fucking everything up.

141
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:28,133
Speaker 0: And why?

142
00:07:28,314 --> 00:07:32,276
Speaker 0: why are they working together for take they want to take over the world like hey There's no heroes in this world.

143
00:07:32,296 --> 00:07:38,358
Speaker 1: Let's just take it over, but I don't know Devin Devastating everything is not the same as taking everything over.

144
00:07:38,559 --> 00:07:41,227
Speaker 0: I know it's a reign of terror kind of situation.

145
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:44,856
Speaker 0: You know sort of like The all hail Megatron exactly.

146
00:07:44,876 --> 00:07:47,947
Speaker 0: that's not to say you know but again that all hail.

147
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:51,641
Speaker 1: Megatron fell short Primarily because it did such like the superficial.

148
00:07:52,002 --> 00:07:54,482
Speaker 1: He's in charge now didn't go into all the cool stuff They could have done.

149
00:07:54,686 --> 00:08:02,316
Speaker 0: yeah We need to really make one or bad guys are really actually smart like full-on smart and this one Sort of gets there a little bit.

150
00:08:02,677 --> 00:08:06,550
Speaker 0: really what this is all about is sort of like the flavor like the art is not what?

151
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:17,132
Speaker 0: You would normally expect from you know Marvel superhero comic, and it's got all sorts of 80s nostalgia going on And it's pretty cool, and I liked it anyway It was.

152
00:08:17,353 --> 00:08:18,258
Speaker 0: you know it's not like.

153
00:08:18,338 --> 00:08:23,280
Speaker 0: oh man everyone rush out and buy Marvel 1985 Holy shit, but it's sort of like hey.

154
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,344
Speaker 0: This is pretty fun.

155
00:08:24,766 --> 00:08:27,395
Speaker 0: You know little kid Galactus shows up.

156
00:08:27,556 --> 00:08:30,125
Speaker 0: It's crazy time you probably want to read.

157
00:08:30,205 --> 00:08:30,567
Speaker 1: you know what.

158
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:31,510
Speaker 1: I take that back.

159
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,530
Speaker 1: You want to read this before you read 1602 because it's a roller coaster syndrome.

160
00:08:35,770 --> 00:08:39,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not really related to 1602 except for the fact that there's a year in the title.

161
00:08:40,251 --> 00:08:46,820
Speaker 1: Oh, I know the title is mostly for the same problem that the first Batman comic I ever actually read was Dark Knight Returns.

162
00:08:46,921 --> 00:08:49,434
Speaker 1: No every other Batman comic Just doesn't live up.

163
00:08:49,917 --> 00:08:52,450
Speaker 0: I should get some of the other ones that people say are also great.

164
00:08:52,611 --> 00:08:53,695
Speaker 1: Yeah, but everyone agrees.

165
00:08:53,715 --> 00:08:54,860
Speaker 1: They're not as good.

166
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,150
Speaker 1: They're good, but they're not as good anyway.

167
00:08:57,472 --> 00:09:01,370
Speaker 0: So yeah, if you haven't read 1602 you should definitely go and get that instead.

168
00:09:02,053 --> 00:09:03,943
Speaker 0: You want to do a whole show on it.

169
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:04,506
Speaker 1: I think we could do.

170
00:09:04,586 --> 00:09:05,390
Speaker 0: I gotta read it again.

171
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:07,920
Speaker 1: All right pretty much anything.

172
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,447
Speaker 0: I got the hardcover that bitch.

173
00:09:09,647 --> 00:09:15,350
Speaker 1: You know I Superheroes aside Thor has about plus 10 to my liking of anything.

174
00:09:16,191 --> 00:09:16,592
Speaker 0: Why don't you?

175
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:18,800
Speaker 0: why didn't you could read Thor every month if you wanted to?

176
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,261
Speaker 0: why don't you?

177
00:09:19,623 --> 00:09:21,810
Speaker 1: because that you realize Thor the comic?

178
00:09:22,112 --> 00:09:26,812
Speaker 1: Has a total score of 10.

179
00:09:26,812 --> 00:09:33,119
Speaker 1: So anyway was actually some big news in the anime con comic-con circuit And they all come together every year.

180
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:35,470
Speaker 1: we go to the New York comic-con and the New York anime festival.

181
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:36,756
Speaker 0: Okay festivals in two weeks.

182
00:09:37,037 --> 00:09:38,906
Speaker 1: Yes, and we'll talk about that during the meta bit.

183
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:53,130
Speaker 1: I'm gonna push it off But the New York comic-con and the New York anime festival starting in 2010 at least once and Probably forever after this as long as this doesn't like explode are going to be confined into one convention.

184
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:54,676
Speaker 1: They're gonna take over the whole Javits.

185
00:09:54,997 --> 00:09:57,186
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like the biggest craziest thing ever.

186
00:09:57,266 --> 00:10:01,481
Speaker 1: I think in the long run It's going to eclipse some of those West Coast shows.

187
00:10:02,003 --> 00:10:04,130
Speaker 0: wow that's it's pretty crazy.

188
00:10:04,772 --> 00:10:08,042
Speaker 1: Anime festival gets a ton of people like it's one of the bigger anime cons.

189
00:10:08,403 --> 00:10:19,562
Speaker 1: the New York comic-con is like the biggest thing outside Of STCC yeah, and now that they're putting both in the same building in New York City I think they realize it's cheaper to do one big convention than two right.

190
00:10:19,924 --> 00:10:25,518
Speaker 0: and also you know New York anime festival It's pretty great But it's not really you know super great.

191
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:30,012
Speaker 0: and the New York comic-con like needs a little bit more to get near to San Diego's Level.

192
00:10:30,032 --> 00:10:31,057
Speaker 0: it's like you know.

193
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:33,390
Speaker 0: combining them was a really really great strategy.

194
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:36,130
Speaker 0: However, I hope they realize you know they're gonna.

195
00:10:36,412 --> 00:10:39,370
Speaker 0: You know obviously they'll be able to sell more tickets because they have the whole job at once.

196
00:10:39,551 --> 00:10:40,838
Speaker 1: I think what I know.

197
00:10:40,918 --> 00:10:41,683
Speaker 1: they know this.

198
00:10:42,145 --> 00:10:42,990
Speaker 1: I know they know it.

199
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:44,488
Speaker 1: I don't know what they're going to do about it.

200
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:49,810
Speaker 1: But the I mean while notice how a lot of anime people go to the New York comic-con just because they like convention.

201
00:10:49,991 --> 00:10:50,634
Speaker 1: So it's not like.

202
00:10:50,674 --> 00:10:51,258
Speaker 1: they're not from.

203
00:10:51,298 --> 00:10:57,210
Speaker 1: the people who go to the New York comic-con are not familiar with The anime kids and what they do at cons like they're used to that.

204
00:10:57,271 --> 00:10:57,643
Speaker 1: It's there.

205
00:10:58,331 --> 00:11:02,661
Speaker 1: But the New York comic-con like here's example the dealers room is.

206
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:09,879
Speaker 1: the dealer area is basically just like here's the row of Silver Age comics, and here's the row of Gold Age comics.

207
00:11:10,842 --> 00:11:15,518
Speaker 1: and the dealers room at an anime con is here's the row of swords Here's the row of manga.

208
00:11:15,538 --> 00:11:18,130
Speaker 1: I don't know how they're going to coexist.

209
00:11:18,973 --> 00:11:20,310
Speaker 0: It's gonna be really really interesting.

210
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:26,199
Speaker 0: I think the thing is actually I kind of really like this because you know We're definitely gonna be doing stuff at it.

211
00:11:26,219 --> 00:11:27,425
Speaker 0: No matter what my god.

212
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:27,606
Speaker 1: Yes.

213
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:29,032
Speaker 1: We're already taught We're.

214
00:11:29,193 --> 00:11:31,643
Speaker 1: the thing is I'm a bigger audience is better right.

215
00:11:31,683 --> 00:11:35,439
Speaker 0: and second of all you know the New York And a festival was really a one-day con.

216
00:11:35,459 --> 00:11:40,923
Speaker 0: you would go walk around for a day looking at stuff And that'd be it and then your comic-con was a one-day con.

217
00:11:40,943 --> 00:11:43,092
Speaker 0: you walked around looking at the exhibition hall And that was it.

218
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:44,216
Speaker 0: and they're really the panels.

219
00:11:44,658 --> 00:11:47,609
Speaker 0: not that exciting except our panels right.

220
00:11:47,689 --> 00:11:54,287
Speaker 0: if they These two this is gonna be a three-day full-on do everything you can at this con.

221
00:11:54,327 --> 00:11:55,330
Speaker 0: get the full action.

222
00:11:55,511 --> 00:12:05,650
Speaker 1: So I know many of you have seen us at the New York comic-con or anime festival for and we're usually like well usually like Breeze in do like our panels and disappear, and then we'll like interview some people and we're gone like we're ghosts.

223
00:12:06,834 --> 00:12:07,944
Speaker 0: I might just for the one year.

224
00:12:07,965 --> 00:12:08,470
Speaker 0: We had a table.

225
00:12:08,671 --> 00:12:12,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, I might just get a hotel room and just stay in the city for the whole weekend.

226
00:12:12,532 --> 00:12:12,613
Speaker 0: I'm.

227
00:12:12,653 --> 00:12:16,932
Speaker 0: hopefully we'll be living in the city by October of 2010.

228
00:12:16,932 --> 00:12:20,070
Speaker 0: If I actually gonna call a guy tomorrow, I saw some nice apart.

229
00:12:20,070 --> 00:12:20,592
Speaker 0: We'll see.

230
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:20,853
Speaker 1: cuz.

231
00:12:21,114 --> 00:12:22,459
Speaker 1: maybe we'll fast forward to that time.

232
00:12:22,479 --> 00:12:25,069
Speaker 1: you'll be living in like one of the five bedrooms in my house.

233
00:12:25,933 --> 00:12:26,616
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

234
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:27,622
Speaker 1: I don't know.

235
00:12:27,662 --> 00:12:28,567
Speaker 1: my house is pretty nice.

236
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:32,909
Speaker 0: if I get it No, and if I'm living in your house, then you can go live in somewhere else.

237
00:12:34,192 --> 00:12:35,518
Speaker 1: But anyway that the other.

238
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:37,890
Speaker 1: the one issue I see too is with the artist alley.

239
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:39,496
Speaker 1: I mean near anime festival.

240
00:12:39,536 --> 00:12:44,133
Speaker 1: artist alley is a artist alley like anime cons have New York.

241
00:12:44,174 --> 00:12:44,697
Speaker 1: comic-con.

242
00:12:44,737 --> 00:12:46,710
Speaker 1: artist alley is mostly big-name people.

243
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:47,552
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like.

244
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:50,090
Speaker 0: how are they going to really shouldn't be in an artist alley?

245
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:50,571
Speaker 0: How?

246
00:12:50,591 --> 00:12:53,185
Speaker 1: because I think the artist alley is a different thing at a comic-con.

247
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:54,030
Speaker 0: I think what they're gonna do.

248
00:12:54,171 --> 00:12:55,015
Speaker 0: This is my prediction.

249
00:12:55,035 --> 00:12:55,377
Speaker 0: You're ready.

250
00:12:55,558 --> 00:12:56,684
Speaker 1: All right, cuz I have a prediction too.

251
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:59,750
Speaker 0: Let's see if they're the same you go Okay, so the New York comic-con last year, right?

252
00:13:00,050 --> 00:13:05,331
Speaker 0: It took up right the big area the main area of the Javits the entire main area Right.

253
00:13:05,853 --> 00:13:13,019
Speaker 0: the New York anime festival took up the whole downstairs area of the Javits, you know, it wasn't in the upstairs It was in the downstairs.

254
00:13:13,846 --> 00:13:18,270
Speaker 0: I think That what they're gonna do is they're not gonna merge them like physically.

255
00:13:18,431 --> 00:13:24,210
Speaker 0: It's gonna be the New York comic-con upstairs new kind of festival downstairs at the same time and one ticket will get you into both.

256
00:13:24,775 --> 00:13:28,540
Speaker 0: So that I think you know A lot of comic people won't even go downstairs.

257
00:13:28,902 --> 00:13:30,790
Speaker 0: a lot of enemy people won't even go upstairs.

258
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,139
Speaker 1: But I don't will.

259
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:33,105
Speaker 1: I disagree on that point.

260
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:38,786
Speaker 1: if they do it that way I think the comic people are going to stay in the comic area, but the anime people will be everywhere.

261
00:13:39,448 --> 00:13:40,010
Speaker 0: It's possible.

262
00:13:40,972 --> 00:13:43,050
Speaker 0: They'll definitely be cross mixing of kinds.

263
00:13:43,331 --> 00:13:44,136
Speaker 1: I just think there'll be a lot.

264
00:13:44,196 --> 00:13:46,690
Speaker 0: I think there will be less cross mixing than you would think.

265
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:49,716
Speaker 1: No I think there's gonna be a very disparate cross mixing.

266
00:13:49,796 --> 00:13:52,809
Speaker 1: a lot more anime people are gonna check out comic stuff than vice-versa.

267
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:55,350
Speaker 1: It's possible because you know just everything is the question.

268
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:55,793
Speaker 0: I remember

269
00:13:55,833 --> 00:14:08,950
Speaker 1: every anime con we go to like people are into a lot of things but Every comic-con we go to like half the people who run into are literally like with no exaggeration Telling us things like I'm here to buy Silver Age spider-man and that is the only reason I'm here.

270
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,216
Speaker 0: I know how about this right?

271
00:14:10,618 --> 00:14:13,170
Speaker 0: Let's say you're a dealer and there's two dealer rooms.

272
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:19,013
Speaker 0: Obviously if you're like an anime dealer, you know which one to go in and if you're like a guy who's selling Silver Age comics You know where to go.

273
00:14:19,073 --> 00:14:20,822
Speaker 1: What if you're the sword dealer, right?

274
00:14:20,842 --> 00:14:22,630
Speaker 0: Well, what if you're like vertical comics, right?

275
00:14:22,710 --> 00:14:24,300
Speaker 0: They would get a booth at both conventions.

276
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,910
Speaker 0: They would get you know, vertical incorporated.

277
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:28,363
Speaker 0: They would get a booth at the anime and they get a booth.

278
00:14:28,423 --> 00:14:29,650
Speaker 1: I don't think they're gonna do it that way.

279
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,056
Speaker 1: I think it's gonna be more integrated.

280
00:14:31,096 --> 00:14:34,670
Speaker 1: I think more integrated, but I think like I think the artist alley will be tiered.

281
00:14:34,792 --> 00:14:39,867
Speaker 1: They'll be like multiple Sections of the artist alley that are basically the same but a lot of different titles.

282
00:14:40,027 --> 00:14:40,409
Speaker 0: They got it.

283
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,293
Speaker 0: It'll be definitely.

284
00:14:41,474 --> 00:14:50,050
Speaker 0: it's gonna be really really really really interesting But it's a long way off so they have a lot of time to get it right or at least to figure things out.

285
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:50,873
Speaker 1: But that's my prediction.

286
00:14:50,893 --> 00:14:55,170
Speaker 1: They're gonna have like the artist alley will have like the big name section and the normal section.

287
00:14:55,230 --> 00:15:02,290
Speaker 0: I think it would actually be better if they mix them up like the big names and the small names to fix the traffic problems In the New York comic-con artist alley.

288
00:15:02,971 --> 00:15:05,099
Speaker 0: You know because the comic-con artist alley is big problems.

289
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:08,657
Speaker 0: all those big names if they put all the anime people mixed in Shuffle it up.

290
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,170
Speaker 0: You can really help the traffic out.

291
00:15:10,391 --> 00:15:14,868
Speaker 1: No, then you get the life old situation where the penny arcade line just goes past them and no one ever sees the table.

292
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:21,530
Speaker 0: Yeah But it helps the traffic gives the lines to hand maybe maybe and then you know what all those people standing in line.

293
00:15:21,591 --> 00:15:22,357
Speaker 0: We'll look at their shit.

294
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,810
Speaker 1: They're not gonna do it that way though.

295
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:24,512
Speaker 1: Yeah I'm pretty sure.

296
00:15:24,532 --> 00:15:28,828
Speaker 1: they're just gonna have areas with different titles like different designations and the same thing.

297
00:15:28,848 --> 00:15:36,868
Speaker 1: in the dealers room They're probably gonna have like the comic area of people just selling comics and like different areas of different kinds of dealers But I'm gonna have like the same.

298
00:15:37,211 --> 00:15:39,163
Speaker 0: Like how many panel rooms are they gonna be like?

299
00:15:39,203 --> 00:15:40,250
Speaker 0: are you gonna have like a problem?

300
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:44,450
Speaker 0: We're like there's an anime panel you want to go to but there's a comic-con panel at the same time.

301
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,801
Speaker 0: It's just like ah, what do I see?

302
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:46,810
Speaker 1: most definitely?

303
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:48,339
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a lot of panels you have to deal with.

304
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:50,009
Speaker 0: it's gonna be crazy crazy shit.

305
00:15:50,231 --> 00:15:51,154
Speaker 1: I'm excited me.

306
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:51,857
Speaker 0: a three-day deal.

307
00:15:51,897 --> 00:15:54,869
Speaker 1: The main reason I'm excited is that normally, you know, we'd only do panels.

308
00:15:54,909 --> 00:15:59,050
Speaker 1: the New York Anime Festival we were just now because the comic-con is branching more and more into gaming.

309
00:15:59,614 --> 00:16:01,950
Speaker 1: We really want to bring our gaming content to the New York comic.

310
00:16:02,131 --> 00:16:05,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a lot of gaming like companies at the New York comic-con last year.

311
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:08,269
Speaker 0: Remember we talked to like upper deck with their Warcraft minis and stuff.

312
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:11,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was that whole table that had all those board games.

313
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,315
Speaker 1: if they unify them It's the best of both worlds.

314
00:16:13,335 --> 00:16:18,664
Speaker 1: because remember when we brought up beyond D&D to Otacon and it was like this You know like thousand people in the room standing room.

315
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:19,469
Speaker 1: only crazy thing.

316
00:16:20,651 --> 00:16:27,164
Speaker 1: Now we have the excuse to do panels like that at a comic-con anime festival Daryl Surratt Non-withstanding.

317
00:16:27,366 --> 00:16:31,544
Speaker 0: no Anyway, yeah, it's gonna be a very interesting con.

318
00:16:31,585 --> 00:16:37,910
Speaker 0: It's a long way off and I'm actually you know, it's like I wasn't really looking forward to New York anime festival comic-con.

319
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:41,173
Speaker 0: It was just sort of like alright here they come again, you know What am I gonna do?

320
00:16:41,355 --> 00:16:43,450
Speaker 1: I'm gonna talk to like David Peterson again.

321
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,012
Speaker 0: I know it's like.

322
00:16:44,052 --> 00:16:46,320
Speaker 0: it's much better for me because now I've got another.

323
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:55,190
Speaker 0: I like to have fewer cons that are More powerful and have lots of air cons that take up a lot of time and a lot of energy, but aren't that great?

324
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:06,130
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day, so I have a non video here.

325
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:12,053
Speaker 1: Usually it's like videos from College Humor, but I'm trying to avoid that because seriously you were looking at a few considering I was.

326
00:17:12,174 --> 00:17:14,609
Speaker 1: but seriously half my things of the day are from College Humor.

327
00:17:14,670 --> 00:17:17,162
Speaker 1: You should just go to College Humor and watch their video.

328
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:19,818
Speaker 0: college humor comm slash videos Yes, but any rims.

329
00:17:19,858 --> 00:17:20,563
Speaker 0: things of the day.

330
00:17:20,644 --> 00:17:26,262
Speaker 1: So this guy This guy has been a fan of Mad Max for 27 years.

331
00:17:26,363 --> 00:17:28,249
Speaker 1: Mad Max is like the greatest movie in the world.

332
00:17:28,269 --> 00:17:30,375
Speaker 1: to him There's a fan of everything.

333
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:34,650
Speaker 1: so what he has done is first he recreated the car the Mad Max interceptor.

334
00:17:34,690 --> 00:17:35,389
Speaker 0: That's pretty awesome.

335
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,130
Speaker 1: And he has a blue healer named dog All right.

336
00:17:38,210 --> 00:17:44,769
Speaker 1: And he moved to the Australian outback to make a Mad Max museum and live as much as possible the life of Mad Max.

337
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,095
Speaker 0: Two men enter one man leave he.

338
00:17:48,099 --> 00:17:48,701
Speaker 0: what if I entered?

339
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:50,065
Speaker 0: when he doesn't leave what happens?

340
00:17:50,106 --> 00:17:50,346
Speaker 0: then?

341
00:17:50,447 --> 00:17:51,350
Speaker 1: there's this town.

342
00:17:51,511 --> 00:17:55,810
Speaker 1: I think it's called Silverton in Australia, and I think they actually filmed Mad Max out in that area.

343
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of the.

344

00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:04,090
Speaker 1: He's opening a Mad Max Museum.

346
00:18:04,673 --> 00:18:06,180
Speaker 1: He dresses like the Mad Max guy.

347
00:18:06,341 --> 00:18:12,070
Speaker 1: is just the story behind This is cool enough and Mad Max is cool enough to where I think it warrants the thing of the day.

348
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:14,122
Speaker 0: What does Melvin gibstein think about this?

349
00:18:14,142 --> 00:18:15,510
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

00:18:15,991 --> 00:18:17,757
Speaker 1: I will say here's a quote from the article.

Speaker 0: There's someone who lives and breathes everything.

355
00:18:30,579 --> 00:18:34,114
Speaker 0: You know we're just talking about Pokemon, but there's a lot of Pokemaniacs out there.

356
00:18:34,174 --> 00:18:35,177
Speaker 1: here is an example.

357
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,665
Speaker 1: We always talk about the difference between a geek and a nerd.

358
00:18:38,047 --> 00:18:39,010
Speaker 1: this guy is a nerd.

359
00:18:39,090 --> 00:18:40,639
Speaker 1: He's a big-time nerd.

00:18:40,699 --> 00:18:42,610
Speaker 1: He's a Mad Max nerd.

361
00:18:43,691 --> 00:18:50,323

371
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:19,086
Speaker 0: Yeah, just put like the first as many episodes you can fit on a DVD right.

372
00:19:19,106 --> 00:19:20,897
Speaker 0: make it a region-free You know.

373
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:25,339
Speaker 0: put a little letter in there like hey I read about you on whatever website was what website?

374
00:19:25,379 --> 00:19:26,463
Speaker 1: is it some news site?

375
00:19:26,844 --> 00:19:27,305
Speaker 0: right about you?

376
00:19:27,325 --> 00:19:33,210
Speaker 0: in the newspaper Times online I read about you in the times, and I you know I heard you're a fan of Mad Max.

377
00:19:33,671 --> 00:19:38,790
Speaker 0: Here is a you know a Japanese animated cartoon from the olden days that I think you might enjoy it.

378
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,756
Speaker 0: It's very similar to mad.

379
00:19:39,776 --> 00:19:41,405
Speaker 1: Wow Silverton all right.

380
00:19:41,445 --> 00:19:42,230
Speaker 1: It's out in the Outback.

381
00:19:42,912 --> 00:19:45,880
Speaker 1: It is 800 miles west of Sydney.

382
00:19:45,901 --> 00:19:47,465
Speaker 0: That's in the middle of nowhere.

383
00:19:47,545 --> 00:19:50,813
Speaker 1: It has a population of 51 Including him.

384
00:19:50,854 --> 00:19:52,601
Speaker 1: so he was the 51st person to move.

385
00:19:52,641 --> 00:19:55,798
Speaker 0: so if you address it to you know I'm sure it'll get there.

386
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:57,230
Speaker 0: you watch a painting posted.

387
00:19:57,331 --> 00:19:59,160
Speaker 1: They're like three other people named that.

388
00:19:59,482 --> 00:20:00,970
Speaker 0: I wonder how often they get mail out there.

389
00:20:01,373 --> 00:20:02,602
Speaker 0: I don't know they got to have met.

390
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:03,770
Speaker 0: this is not stare must be man.

391
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:04,191
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

392
00:20:04,573 --> 00:20:08,145
Speaker 1: I want to send something to this town now because think there's only 51 people in the town.

393
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:13,650
Speaker 1: if a DVD Shows up in the mail you will probably have everyone in that town watching it.

394
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,601
Speaker 0: I'm sure that they can buy things on Amazon.

395
00:20:15,621 --> 00:20:16,929
Speaker 0: They probably get DVDs all the time.

396
00:20:17,832 --> 00:20:26,030
Speaker 1: I will probably make more fans of fist of the North Star by mailing a DVD to this remote Mad Max town than I ever Would talking about it on geek nights possible.

397
00:20:27,272 --> 00:20:28,830
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I got thing of the day.

398
00:20:28,931 --> 00:20:34,988
Speaker 0: It's more appropriate for a Tuesday But I wanted to spread this love to the Wednesday because I think the Tuesday would already know about this kind of thing.

399
00:20:35,008 --> 00:20:38,372
Speaker 0: all right You know we like Cthulhu.

400
00:20:38,633 --> 00:20:39,977
Speaker 0: who doesn't like Cthulhu right?

401
00:20:40,278 --> 00:20:43,087
Speaker 0: ah no though tap I think he actually likes it.

402
00:20:43,107 --> 00:20:43,950
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

403
00:20:44,030 --> 00:20:45,270
Speaker 0: I mean he's always praying to anyway.

404
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:48,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, but um and you know we like battle tech.

405
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,264
Speaker 0: right two great gaming classics.

406
00:20:50,324 --> 00:20:52,270
Speaker 0: You know the battle tech and the call of Cthulhu, right?

407
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:54,969
Speaker 0: How about Cthulhu tech?

408
00:20:56,873 --> 00:20:58,078
Speaker 1: Is this like poke through Lou?

409
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,243
Speaker 0: no, it's totally.

410
00:20:59,263 --> 00:21:00,930
Speaker 0: this is actually a legit game.

411
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:02,277
Speaker 0: It actually has to expand.

412
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:04,550
Speaker 1: is poke through Lou was the legit game?

413
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:07,830
Speaker 0: No, this is a super legit game like holy crap.

414
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:13,590
Speaker 0: So selling a rule book in PDF for like 70 bucks is this literally just max versus Cthulhu?

415
00:21:14,652 --> 00:21:15,097
Speaker 0: I'm it's.

416
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:21,225
Speaker 0: it's fucking Cthulhu tag and it's for real and it actually won a lot of awards for being a good game.

417
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:22,349
Speaker 1: Let's get it.

418
00:21:22,691 --> 00:21:23,599
Speaker 0: It's like 70 bucks.

419
00:21:23,639 --> 00:21:27,161
Speaker 0: by thinking gonna pay for it anyway I might pay and I get a PDF immediately.

420
00:21:27,241 --> 00:21:29,050
Speaker 0: so and then the full book will come later.

421
00:21:29,412 --> 00:21:32,789
Speaker 0: And then if we play it if we actually play it then I'll buy some of the expansion bits.

422
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:36,868
Speaker 0: The one expansion allows for like minor cults to enter the game.

423
00:21:36,888 --> 00:21:39,638
Speaker 0: ah And I didn't read what the other one did.

424
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,490
Speaker 0: but yeah Cthulhu tech is totally for reals.

425
00:21:42,611 --> 00:21:44,170
Speaker 1: I've sounded up our alley in a big way.

426
00:21:44,371 --> 00:21:44,653
Speaker 0: I know.

427
00:21:44,794 --> 00:21:46,403
Speaker 0: even if it's a bad you know I can't.

428
00:21:46,524 --> 00:21:47,570
Speaker 0: it's won a lot of awards.

429
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,257
Speaker 0: I mean come on even if it's shitty.

430
00:21:49,398 --> 00:21:52,110
Speaker 1: it'll go on the shelf next to all the other really expensive though.

431
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:56,625
Speaker 1: It'll go next to all the other RPGs and board games that aren't good, but we bought anyway.

432
00:21:57,046 --> 00:21:58,250
Speaker 1: Yeah like Twilight Struggle.

433
00:21:58,350 --> 00:21:59,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, I spent.

434
00:21:59,294 --> 00:22:01,906
Speaker 0: I spent more money five dollars more on battle lore.

435
00:22:01,986 --> 00:22:04,819
Speaker 1: so yeah I see I told you battle or is a bad.

436
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,030
Speaker 0: sell that battle or anyone want a battle lore?

437
00:22:07,112 --> 00:22:08,354
Speaker 0: It's yeah It's a full set.

438
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:12,994
Speaker 0: hardly ever played a battle or and I actually have an extra board so you can play with a board That's twice as big.

439
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:14,179
Speaker 0: yeah, and I'll try.

440
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:23,317
Speaker 0: you know I paid like a total of like 85 something $90 for both parts, so if you you know I'll sell it for a lot less than that.

441
00:22:23,317 --> 00:22:26,950
Speaker 0: 50 bucks 40 bucks whatever battle or comes like a million miniatures.

442
00:22:27,236 --> 00:22:27,929
Speaker 0: They're all unpainted.

443
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:34,688
Speaker 1: So anyway before we get on to the main bit and our Pokemon adventure stylings This is where we do the meta bits.

444
00:22:34,709 --> 00:22:39,902
Speaker 1: now It's a new bit on geek nights where we try to keep all of our meta crap out of the rest of the show and put It right here.

445
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:42,717
Speaker 1: You know met all the stuff about geek nights.

446
00:22:42,978 --> 00:22:47,716
Speaker 1: that is not relevant unless you are a fan of geek nights directly and in our community.

447

458
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:28,910
Speaker 0: It's like $180 worth of manga, so you want to enter if you have any Photoshop or design skills whatsoever.

459
00:23:29,493 --> 00:23:34,400
Speaker 1: So metabit number two we are going to be at the New York anime festival And I've got our schedule here for you.

460
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:34,822
Speaker 1: finally.

461
00:23:34,903 --> 00:23:35,970
Speaker 1: I just I had to go dig it up.

462
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:41,929
Speaker 1: I you know this was settled like four months ago So I had to go find like this old email to figure out what we're doing now.

463
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:53,278
Speaker 1: So perhaps the last New York anime festival the New York anime festival is next weekend for the 25th 26th and 27th of September in the Jacob Javits Center in New York City.

464
00:23:53,719 --> 00:24:02,210
Speaker 1: We are going to be there Friday and Saturday Friday evening 730 in Panel room 3. we were doing know your creators the same panel.

465
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:03,176
Speaker 1: We did a note account.

466
00:24:03,196 --> 00:24:06,757
Speaker 1: so if you saw the note account the last time we're gonna do that panel We're gonna revamp it.

467
00:24:06,777 --> 00:24:08,850
Speaker 1: We're basically we're gonna drop it and do a similar panel.

468
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:11,290
Speaker 1: That's very different, but accomplishes the same purpose.

469
00:24:11,852 --> 00:24:13,556
Speaker 1: So this is the last running of it.

470
00:24:13,596 --> 00:24:17,347
Speaker 1: if you really want to say it check it out and on Saturday at 7 45 p.m.

471
00:24:18,630 --> 00:24:23,390
Speaker 1: also in panel 3 and Anime every fan should see colon cover your bases.

472
00:24:24,033 --> 00:24:26,503
Speaker 1: That's basically an amalgamation of every different title.

473
00:24:26,544 --> 00:24:30,217
Speaker 1: We've given this panel in the last Two panels only two panels.

474
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:32,886
Speaker 1: It's pretty easy Friday and Saturday and Saturday.

475
00:24:32,906 --> 00:24:34,090
Speaker 0: They're both nighttime panels.

476
00:24:34,150 --> 00:24:37,144
Speaker 0: So during Saturday during the day, maybe we can go look at apartments or something.

477
00:24:37,204 --> 00:24:38,410
Speaker 1: I think it's Saturday during the day.

478
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:40,143
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do some stuff in the city for sure.

479
00:24:40,163 --> 00:24:41,090
Speaker 0: we should go look at apartments.

480
00:24:41,411 --> 00:24:42,917
Speaker 1: Yeah, or maybe we'll do a listener meetup.

481
00:24:43,137 --> 00:24:43,920
Speaker 0: anyone who's going?

482
00:24:44,081 --> 00:24:44,924
Speaker 0: oh, not a bad idea.

483
00:24:45,285 --> 00:24:50,670
Speaker 1: Let us know and Saturday we'll try to schedule something like we can say hi, or maybe we'll take you guys out.

484
00:24:50,710 --> 00:24:55,654
Speaker 0: So I'll make a thread in the forum for like yeah 09 listener meetup.

485
00:24:55,734 --> 00:25:02,053
Speaker 0: and if anyone listening to this is going to the nyaf then post there, and so if there's no more nyaf It's just the nyaf Nick.

486
00:25:02,394 --> 00:25:02,875
Speaker 0: I think well.

487
00:25:03,036 --> 00:25:03,417
Speaker 0: I mean there.

488
00:25:03,437 --> 00:25:04,681
Speaker 0: start the read exhibitions.

489
00:25:04,762 --> 00:25:06,628
Speaker 0: right they got this show in Chicago the c2e2.

490
00:25:07,450 --> 00:25:09,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically gonna be an everything con.

491
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,485
Speaker 0: get you know everything nerdy right.

492
00:25:11,866 --> 00:25:15,370
Speaker 0: so I think what they're doing is They realize that New York Comic Con combine it with nyaf.

493
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:22,389
Speaker 0: They can sort of make it more like the c2e2 and basically what they'll end up doing is saving a lot of resources and run Basically the same show twice.

494
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:28,169
Speaker 1: I'm honestly getting more and more excited about read doing these geek conventions because they're you see every year like they.

495
00:25:28,429 --> 00:25:31,630
Speaker 1: you know They're a professional business, and you know I work with a lot of the people.

496
00:25:32,054 --> 00:25:32,721
Speaker 0: You know it's.

497
00:25:32,943 --> 00:25:33,610
Speaker 0: it's taken a while.

498
00:25:33,650 --> 00:25:37,730
Speaker 0: They started out doing the shows the same way they did their normal business II shows.

499
00:25:37,851 --> 00:25:41,250
Speaker 0: But now I think they've realized geek shows make a lot more money.

500
00:25:41,672 --> 00:25:45,850
Speaker 0: They get a lot more press they're a lot more exciting and they're learning how to do them with time.

501
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:51,112
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need more than just a room full of booze and as far as I can tell the staff like they're getting into it More and more.

502
00:25:51,132 --> 00:25:52,217
Speaker 1: they're really enjoying well.

503
00:25:52,237 --> 00:25:55,110
Speaker 0: They're hiring a lot of people who are nerdy to handle that kind of shit.

504
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:57,958
Speaker 1: Yep, but the other cool thing is that remember they're doing.

505
00:25:57,978 --> 00:26:01,328
Speaker 1: they're handling all the logistics for PAX East - so read one.

506
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:24,444
Speaker 1: They spend all this time like analyzing their conventions and figuring out how to do them better And they have professional resources to throw at that sort of thing - by managing PAX East and All these different comic and anime cons they basically are in a position to learn from like the things that all these different kinds of cons do well and Amalgamate them into what could be in the end like the generic uber geek con.

507
00:26:24,544 --> 00:26:25,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's definitely.

508
00:26:25,688 --> 00:26:25,888
Speaker 0: you know.

509
00:26:25,908 --> 00:26:29,490
Speaker 0: their cons You know are good, but they're not like oh super amazing.

510
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:38,484
Speaker 0: But they're definitely you can see they're clearly improving and learning and I think they're gonna you know Eventually, they're just gonna be like the masters of the geek con plus.

511
00:26:38,524 --> 00:26:40,678
Speaker 1: I will say as a meta aside You're like we do.

512
00:26:40,698 --> 00:26:45,207
Speaker 1: we're staff on Connecticut We're the heads of panels and we do stuff like Otacon and everything and anime.

513
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:48,230
Speaker 1: Boston's fun But it's not really relevant to a lot of you.

514
00:26:48,270 --> 00:26:51,750
Speaker 1: You know you go to these cons as an attendee you want to enjoy the panels do all the stuff.

515
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:58,789
Speaker 1: but from our perspective the meta perspective as like performers as Lecturers as staff is all this stuff.

516
00:26:59,731 --> 00:27:05,630
Speaker 1: The professional cons and the ones run by read are just so much nicer to work with and so much easier to deal with.

517
00:27:05,690 --> 00:27:06,980
Speaker 0: They actually email you back.

518
00:27:07,041 --> 00:27:08,230
Speaker 0: That's pretty much the only difference.

519
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:08,491
Speaker 0: I mean.

520
00:27:08,973 --> 00:27:14,615
Speaker 1: if you guys saw like all the bullshit and hurdles we have to go through at some of these fan conventions to do That like just to do a panel.

521
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,278
Speaker 0: It's mostly cuz.

522
00:27:15,318 --> 00:27:16,724
Speaker 0: just people don't email us back.

523
00:27:16,744 --> 00:27:18,695
Speaker 0: That's really the only problem It's.

524
00:27:18,775 --> 00:27:20,750
Speaker 1: but I mean more and more.

525
00:27:21,232 --> 00:27:27,098
Speaker 1: I don't want to turn my back on the fan run cons because I like them and for attendees I still think in a lot of ways they're better.

526
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:29,629
Speaker 1: like Otacon and anime Boston have a lot going for them.

527
00:27:29,770 --> 00:27:32,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, then of course Pax West is like the ultimate of that.

528
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:39,430
Speaker 1: Yep, but while I don't want to turn my back on these fan cons Personally, it's just so much easier to go to the professional con.

529
00:27:39,530 --> 00:27:47,153
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think our con schedule for the foreseeable future is anime Boston Otacon Pax East-West Connecticut.

530
00:27:47,193 --> 00:27:50,269
Speaker 0: yeah, New York Comic Con Connecticut, and I think that's it right.

531
00:27:50,389 --> 00:27:54,105
Speaker 1: yep And you know the little ancillary things like Zenkai con because that you know our friends Rob.

532
00:27:54,306 --> 00:27:55,190
Speaker 0: are we doing that yeah?

533
00:27:55,572 --> 00:28:00,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're doing some of our good gaming panels and actually that that thing's picking up.

534
00:28:00,191 --> 00:28:01,729
Speaker 1: I could see it going places not very good.

535
00:28:02,111 --> 00:28:04,221
Speaker 1: I don't know if we'll ever have time to do Torah con again.

536
00:28:04,241 --> 00:28:05,286
Speaker 1: I like Torah con.

537
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:06,290
Speaker 1: It's just it's too far away.

538
00:28:06,492 --> 00:28:08,030
Speaker 0: I can't go back to Rochester.

539
00:28:08,612 --> 00:28:12,790
Speaker 0: Maybe if I'm got like mad extra vacation days and mad extra money's I could use the jet blue.

540
00:28:13,372 --> 00:28:15,358
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just more and more.

541
00:28:15,398 --> 00:28:17,043
Speaker 1: all my reasons to go back to Rochester.

542
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,788
Speaker 1: I've moved away from Rochester.

543
00:28:19,009 --> 00:28:23,565
Speaker 0: Yep Okay, so main bit Pokemon adventures.

544
00:28:23,705 --> 00:28:26,960
Speaker 0: Oh snap Gotta catch them all bitches.

545
00:28:27,101 --> 00:28:28,630
Speaker 1: It's real simple, but I learned something.

546
00:28:28,731 --> 00:28:30,970
Speaker 1: I learned something that has changed everything.

547
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,154
Speaker 1: But I'll get to that in a second.

548
00:28:32,776 --> 00:28:36,850
Speaker 1: if you liked the Pokemon games the actual games on Nintendo.

549
00:28:37,031 --> 00:28:39,150
Speaker 0: Yep, not not like any of those other Pokemon.

550
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,333
Speaker 0: You know it's weird.

551
00:28:40,394 --> 00:28:44,144
Speaker 0: Pokemon is a strange thing in that there's sort of like this core right.

552
00:28:44,365 --> 00:28:49,029
Speaker 0: the core is the original Series of games for the Gameboy slash DS.

553
00:28:49,291 --> 00:28:52,610
Speaker 0: You know Pokemon red blue green the ones that are just colors.

554
00:28:52,951 --> 00:29:02,240
Speaker 0: You know not Pokemon snap not Pokemon troze a Pokemon pinball not Pokemon mystery dungeon Just plain old Pokemon color any color.

555
00:29:02,481 --> 00:29:02,702
Speaker 0: right.

556
00:29:02,983 --> 00:29:13,301
Speaker 0: that main series of games is like the core and it's great and a lot of that extra stuff is sort of nay right and You know with the Pokemon anime.

557
00:29:13,542 --> 00:29:15,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever right okay?

558
00:29:15,852 --> 00:29:23,029
Speaker 0: It has some aspects that are good, but really eh right and you know most Pokemon manga is bleh.

559
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,660
Speaker 1: well I'm not even gonna say bleh.

560
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:25,910
Speaker 1: I think it's more simple.

561
00:29:26,492 --> 00:29:31,150
Speaker 1: It's all very different from the core of Pokemon exactly like it's kind of like all those Carcassonne expansions.

562
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:35,170
Speaker 1: You just tacked down around the side of this completely separate original thing.

563
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:41,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Pokemon is a strange thing because you expect Pokemon to be like this kitty sort of thing And you know what it is.

564
00:29:41,215 --> 00:29:45,913
Speaker 0: all that tacked on stuff is exactly the stereotype of what you would think Pokemon is.

565
00:29:46,475 --> 00:29:59,730
Speaker 0: but the core Pokemon stuff the core series of video games and This manga which is pretty much the only other thing that I consider to be in the Pokemon core are the real deal Not just silly kitty stuff.

566
00:30:00,171 --> 00:30:05,324
Speaker 1: I mean basically if you enjoy the Pokemon games you should read this manga.

567
00:30:05,425 --> 00:30:06,628
Speaker 1: make sure you get the right one.

568
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:09,175
Speaker 0: Pokemon Adventures, that's it.

569
00:30:09,335 --> 00:30:11,662
Speaker 0: It's not called Pokemon color.

570
00:30:12,043 --> 00:30:13,206
Speaker 0: It's not called anything else.

571
00:30:13,267 --> 00:30:14,430
Speaker 0: It's just Pokemon adventures.

572
00:30:14,530 --> 00:30:14,852
Speaker 0: That's it.

573
00:30:15,434 --> 00:30:15,736
Speaker 0: That's the.

574
00:30:15,816 --> 00:30:19,050
Speaker 0: that's how you know it's the right one and Viz recently reprinted.

575
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:22,612
Speaker 0: It's he back in the day right back in like the early 2000s I think.

576
00:30:22,692 --> 00:30:25,870
Speaker 0: Viz printed this in the US and they printed in these big books.

577
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:28,201
Speaker 0: They were like full-size there, but they were thin.

578
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:30,170
Speaker 0: it was like one chapter and one trade paper.

579
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:31,718
Speaker 1: I remember Luke had them all at RIT.

580
00:30:31,738 --> 00:30:32,402
Speaker 1: That's how we read it.

581
00:30:32,763 --> 00:30:36,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Luke is like oh my god You got to read this Pokemon manga, and we're like what?

582
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:38,670
Speaker 0: And we read it and we're like oh shit.

583
00:30:39,052 --> 00:30:41,946
Speaker 0: But it was published sort of like as almost like a coloring book.

584
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,189
Speaker 0: so we're like what the fuck You know is with this printing format.

585
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:59,410
Speaker 0: Yeah And then eventually right now like as of like a month or two ago Viz finally reprinting this original Pokemon adventures manga in the you know Manga digest format, so it's actually in an accessible book.

586
00:30:59,771 --> 00:31:01,900
Speaker 0: It's only eight dollars per book.

587
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:04,009
Speaker 0: and let's see this book has volume two.

588
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:07,785
Speaker 0: How many pages are in this guy for eight bucks and try to find a page number?

589
00:31:08,348 --> 00:31:08,870
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

590
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:14,466
Speaker 0: It's a lot of freaking pages at least 200 something more than 200 pages of manga for $8.

591
00:31:14,466 --> 00:31:15,770
Speaker 0: That's a good deal right there.

592
00:31:16,412 --> 00:31:17,980
Speaker 1: Well depends on the manga, but for this one.

593
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:20,210
Speaker 0: definitely this one is definitely the real deal now.

594
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:25,890
Speaker 1: It was originally put up by Shogakukan and in the not I think 1996 1997.

595
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,995
Speaker 0: Oh, it's an old manga.

596
00:31:27,397 --> 00:31:27,819
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

597
00:31:27,859 --> 00:31:28,944
Speaker 1: We're so old.

598
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:30,330
Speaker 1: so oh my god.

599
00:31:30,410 --> 00:31:33,305
Speaker 0: That's actually kind of interesting because I mean we were reading it in the US.

600
00:31:33,345 --> 00:31:38,010
Speaker 0: and what like oh 102. so it took less than like you know five years for it to get over.

601
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:39,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is interesting how this.

602
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,869
Speaker 1: there's the weird nostalgia factor where?

603
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:50,950
Speaker 1: Pokemon is both a lot older than you think and yet not nearly as old as original Pokemon was for the original Gameboy.

604
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:52,475
Speaker 1: But it's weird.

605
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:54,844
Speaker 1: not even Gameboy color just Gameboy my whole like.

606
00:31:55,245 --> 00:32:01,090
Speaker 1: I think of what I cannot Consider or imagine or remember the point at which I became aware of Pokemon.

607
00:32:01,231 --> 00:32:03,239
Speaker 0: I do I remember exactly what I feel as though.

608
00:32:03,259 --> 00:32:05,830
Speaker 1: I was always aware of Pokemon and the Pokemon always existed.

609
00:32:05,931 --> 00:32:09,289
Speaker 0: No, I remember exactly when because I was reading my game Pro magazines, right?

610
00:32:10,451 --> 00:32:13,466
Speaker 0: There was you know suddenly there was all this stuff about Pokemon, and I was like.

611
00:32:13,486 --> 00:32:16,518
Speaker 0: I was like Why are they pushing this kid's game Pokemon?

612
00:32:16,538 --> 00:32:16,980
Speaker 0: whatever?

613
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:19,770
Speaker 0: right and I kept skipping over all the Pokemon stuff.

614
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:24,584
Speaker 0: Just be like whatever whatever and eventually of course my brother who had the Nintendo power right.

615
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,232
Speaker 0: he got the Pokemon for his Gameboy Pocket.

616
00:32:27,694 --> 00:32:29,441
Speaker 0: Gameboy Pocket, but you don't remember that guy.

617
00:32:29,502 --> 00:32:30,265
Speaker 0: I remember that guy.

618
00:32:30,305 --> 00:32:31,350
Speaker 0: Gameboy Pocket was great.

619
00:32:31,410 --> 00:32:32,517
Speaker 1: You know I didn't buy that shit.

620
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:34,430
Speaker 1: at a game gear was already in color.

621
00:32:34,571 --> 00:32:38,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, Gameboy Pocket wasn't in color wasn't but it had that it had a much better screen.

622
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:38,392
Speaker 1: It was.

623
00:32:38,493 --> 00:32:45,585
Speaker 0: my pocket was basically original Gameboy only Smaller had more battery life with two triple-a batteries instead of four double is.

624
00:32:45,625 --> 00:32:48,555
Speaker 0: the screen was green was bigger And the device was smaller.

625
00:32:48,816 --> 00:32:50,081
Speaker 1: also not only was the screen bigger.

626
00:32:50,141 --> 00:32:51,505
Speaker 1: That wasn't the biggest deal.

627
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:54,793
Speaker 1: It was high contrast And white.

628
00:32:54,914 --> 00:32:58,225
Speaker 0: yeah think about the Gameboy Micro, that's what the Gameboy Pocket was.

629
00:32:58,245 --> 00:32:59,590
Speaker 0: it was like that only worth it.

630
00:32:59,771 --> 00:33:10,609
Speaker 1: I mean the Gameboy Pocket like I. As a kid I remember dismissing it until a friend of mine had it And I saw it and I realized that you could have colors other than drab lime to darker drab lime.

631
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:18,480
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so my brother got the Pokemon for the Gameboy Pocket And then I had the Gameboy Color soon after and I was just like our.

632
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,065
Speaker 0: I saw the Pokemon.

633
00:33:20,085 --> 00:33:25,880
Speaker 0: I was like oh wow That's actually like oh That's what that.

634
00:33:26,365 --> 00:33:30,430
Speaker 0: oh, oh I thought it was some kiddie thing all along like whatever.

635
00:33:30,531 --> 00:33:32,846
Speaker 0: I just dismissed it and skipped over it didn't read about it.

636
00:33:33,449 --> 00:33:36,205
Speaker 0: once I saw what it was I was like oh fuck me now.

637
00:33:36,225 --> 00:33:36,950
Speaker 1: We got the Pokemon.

638
00:33:37,132 --> 00:33:38,510
Speaker 1: We keep saying it's the real deal.

639
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:43,687
Speaker 1: But there is solid evidence for this to the point that the quote is like all over the internet.

640
00:33:43,727 --> 00:33:44,470
Speaker 1: It's on Wikipedia.

641
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:55,061
Speaker 1: They're like a million citations for it, but Satoshi Tajiri the guy who created Pokemon mm-hmm He said and I quote Boku got to tie a takata.

642
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:57,850
Speaker 1: Seki no moto mocha Kai manga desk, huh?

643
00:33:58,531 --> 00:34:00,858
Speaker 1: This is the comic that most resembles the world.

644
00:34:00,939 --> 00:34:01,882
Speaker 1: I was trying to convey.

645
00:34:02,102 --> 00:34:12,281
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if you look right at say I only said the Japanese because they pointedly put the Japanese in the Wikipedia To make sure that no one argues about the translation or anything.

646
00:34:12,442 --> 00:34:19,710
Speaker 0: Wow so anyway if you look at the original Pokemon Gameboy game right that that was the first ever Pokemon ever was that Gameboy game.

647
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:21,194
Speaker 0: There was no Pokemon before that.

648
00:34:21,293 --> 00:34:21,676
Speaker 0: that was it.

649
00:34:22,357 --> 00:34:27,092
Speaker 0: then look at say the anime for example right and compare that to the original video Game.

650
00:34:27,534 --> 00:34:28,900
Speaker 0: there's a lot of big differences.

651
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,230
Speaker 0: I mean like Pikachu's his first Pokemon It's like no in the Gameboy game.

652
00:34:33,473 --> 00:34:37,563
Speaker 0: He gets you know either You know Charmander Squirtle or Bulbasaur.

653
00:34:37,704 --> 00:34:40,357
Speaker 0: first Pikachu comes later And that's only if you get one.

654
00:34:40,377 --> 00:34:42,326
Speaker 0: you don't have to get a peek at you if you don't want to.

655
00:34:42,567 --> 00:34:43,824
Speaker 0: it's kind of hard To skip it though.

656
00:34:44,992 --> 00:34:48,533
Speaker 0: You know and there's like the story, and he's not ash Ketchum He's you.

657
00:34:48,614 --> 00:34:50,704
Speaker 0: you name him, but the default name is red.

658
00:34:50,824 --> 00:34:54,159
Speaker 0: cuz he's the red guy and the right There's a rival and his default name is blue.

659
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:56,150
Speaker 1: There's also yellow the yellow Caballero.

660
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:57,193
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the fucking man.

661
00:34:57,213 --> 00:35:00,223
Speaker 0: yellow caviar rocks at the house, but it's like you know.

662
00:35:00,684 --> 00:35:06,963
Speaker 0: Brock and misty don't follow you around Right you know you just fight them once and that gets the end of them.

663
00:35:07,083 --> 00:35:14,156
Speaker 0: also in them in this manga misty Badass and Team Rocket in the ma in the Gameboy game Badass scary dudes.

664
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:16,445
Speaker 0: in the anime you got like that Jesse and James.

665
00:35:16,505 --> 00:35:17,810
Speaker 0: silly nonsense going on.

666
00:35:18,272 --> 00:35:19,737
Speaker 0: So you know the anime.

667
00:35:19,797 --> 00:35:25,920
Speaker 0: while it has many similarities with the original you know Gameboy game It is you know very much a diversion.

668
00:35:26,101 --> 00:35:27,707
Speaker 0: right actually interesting thing.

669
00:35:27,787 --> 00:35:34,050
Speaker 0: right in The anime right the main characters name in the u.s.. Is ash Ketchum right and the rival is what Gary?

670
00:35:34,210 --> 00:35:34,511
Speaker 0: I think.

671
00:35:34,932 --> 00:35:37,558
Speaker 1: yep well the thing is I know you're going with this.

672
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:43,614
Speaker 1: in the original Japanese the names were actually Shigeru and Satoshi.

673
00:35:43,956 --> 00:35:47,310
Speaker 1: you know the names of Miyamoto and the guy who created Pokemon.

674
00:35:47,450 --> 00:35:49,599
Speaker 0: That's in the anime though in the Gameboy game.

675
00:35:49,659 --> 00:35:50,342
Speaker 0: It was red and blue.

676
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:50,623
Speaker 0: Yep.

677
00:35:50,763 --> 00:35:54,469
Speaker 0: Yep, so yeah That's that was sort of interesting to find that out.

678
00:35:55,113 --> 00:36:08,261
Speaker 1: Now anyway I talked earlier about something that blew my mind and like this is like one of those puzzle pieces that fell out into my lap from the internet, and it looks legit and It answers every like question.

679
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:09,606
Speaker 1: everything fell into focus.

680
00:36:09,686 --> 00:36:13,341
Speaker 1: I now understand Everything there is to understand about Pokemon.

681
00:36:13,662 --> 00:36:23,602
Speaker 1: Yep, the guy who created Pokemon Satoshi Tajiri, so when he was a kid as a young boy He lived in Mashida near Tokyo, and he liked to collect bugs.

682
00:36:23,622 --> 00:36:24,365
Speaker 1: all right.

683
00:36:24,846 --> 00:36:26,348
Speaker 1: He just collected bugs Yep.

684
00:36:26,691 --> 00:36:32,875
Speaker 1: So eventually all the places he used to go to collect bugs were paved over and turned into apartments And he was sad.

685
00:36:33,195 --> 00:36:37,870
Speaker 1: so he eventually wanted to make a game where people could relive that and collect bugs.

686
00:36:38,092 --> 00:36:40,050
Speaker 1: He succeeded much in the same way that Miyamoto.

687
00:36:40,191 --> 00:36:41,741
Speaker 1: You know what was Legend of Zelda.

688
00:36:41,801 --> 00:36:45,825
Speaker 1: he used to wander through the woods as a kid And he wanted to recreate that sense of exploration and wonder.

689
00:36:45,946 --> 00:36:46,630
Speaker 0: I had a great idea.

690
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,881
Speaker 0: I'll tell you after the show, but anyway I'll wait to leave listeners hanging.

691
00:36:49,922 --> 00:36:51,110
Speaker 0: so what it rim?

692
00:36:51,210 --> 00:36:55,644
Speaker 0: Tell me what was there something you did as a kid that you now want to recreate and recapture?

693
00:36:55,664 --> 00:36:57,590
Speaker 1: uh play DOS games.

694
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:08,530
Speaker 1: I Installed fucking tie fighter.

695
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:10,054
Speaker 0: You know we should do.

696
00:37:10,094 --> 00:37:15,530
Speaker 0: we should make a video game that sort of recreates the experience of installing and uninstalling games in DOS.

697
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:16,430
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

698
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:17,314
Speaker 0: And that's all it is.

699
00:37:17,354 --> 00:37:23,290
Speaker 0: is like you know just as you pretend to install and uninstall games to keep your DOS disk We can make it in the don't shit your pants style.

700
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:29,688
Speaker 1: Then you have to make boot disks and everything instead of don't shit your pants It's don't break your computer and make tie fighter work now.

701
00:37:30,771 --> 00:37:35,693
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the piece of the puzzle where it all came together Nintendo.

702
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:36,235
Speaker 1: he was called.

703
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:41,193
Speaker 1: the guy was called reclusive and eccentric by people at Nintendo, but very creative Turns out.

704
00:37:41,574 --> 00:37:44,022
Speaker 1: the creator of Pokemon had Asperger's.

705
00:37:44,363 --> 00:37:44,945
Speaker 0: Oh really.

706
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:46,349
Speaker 0: That's a surprise now.

707
00:37:47,133 --> 00:37:48,380
Speaker 0: So the OCD also.

708
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:51,435
Speaker 1: I'm not sure but suddenly Everything tamale.

709
00:37:51,455 --> 00:37:53,563
Speaker 1: you know everything about Pokemon makes sense.

710
00:37:53,623 --> 00:37:55,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely everything anyway.

711
00:37:55,571 --> 00:38:01,950
Speaker 0: Well, we're talking about Pokemon adventures this manga Which is written by he didn't or a kusaka and the art is by motto.

712
00:38:02,372 --> 00:38:04,300
Speaker 0: I guess a person with one name like sting.

713
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,067
Speaker 1: I read that just the coloring was done by motto.

714
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:08,396
Speaker 1: Uh-huh well That's the I'm really I'm not sure.

715
00:38:08,416 --> 00:38:14,918
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the front of the cover of the viz volume 2 Which is story by he didn't or a kusaka art by motto.

716
00:38:15,038 --> 00:38:16,943
Speaker 0: so take from that what you will.

717
00:38:17,164 --> 00:38:19,570
Speaker 0: Satoshi Yamamoto this manga.

718
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:27,530
Speaker 1: Basically as someone who has played I see what happened motto did the first nine volumes and then other people took over after that.

719
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:35,083
Speaker 0: Uh-huh as someone who has played the video games and read this manga This manga is basically a manga version of the video game.

720
00:38:35,164 --> 00:38:42,749
Speaker 0: like it is so dead-on You know in the in the way it feels the way the story goes and everything and so the thing is.

721
00:38:42,789 --> 00:38:49,249
Speaker 0: of course It's more fleshed out because the video game you know Doesn't have a lot of filler in it in terms of lots and lots of text.

722
00:38:49,812 --> 00:38:51,679
Speaker 0: you know it only has a little bit when you talk to people.

723
00:38:51,699 --> 00:38:59,037
Speaker 0: so this sort of takes the shell of the story of the Video game and keeps everything that's in there in there And then just sort of fills in the gaps.

724
00:38:59,459 --> 00:39:00,704
Speaker 0: it adds a little bit to like.

725
00:39:00,724 --> 00:39:06,530
Speaker 0: there's a new character green Who's the girl who's totally awesome, and there's a couple other slight differences?

726
00:39:07,091 --> 00:39:07,893
Speaker 0: But they fit in.

727
00:39:07,934 --> 00:39:13,310
Speaker 0: they don't like stand out as like you know being out of place like the way ash Ketchum does you know?

728
00:39:13,570 --> 00:39:14,875
Speaker 0: This is totally right.

729
00:39:14,956 --> 00:39:18,609
Speaker 0: along with you know the feel and how those games go.

730
00:39:19,198 --> 00:39:19,849
Speaker 0: It's totally great.

731
00:39:21,071 --> 00:39:25,930
Speaker 0: The thing that I like about it the most I think is that you know an Earthsea right the Wizard of Earthsea.

732
00:39:26,354 --> 00:39:36,495
Speaker 0: It's like you read book one It's about Ged right and then like you read the rest of the books and get is sort of like becomes this legendary figure And he's not really around.

733
00:39:36,515 --> 00:39:39,444
Speaker 0: I mean he's kind of around, but he's not really really around.

734
00:39:39,484 --> 00:39:40,868
Speaker 0: he's become this legendary figure.

735
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:41,330
Speaker 0: right.

736
00:39:42,331 --> 00:39:44,177
Speaker 0: these Pokemon books go the same way.

737
00:39:44,258 --> 00:39:47,669
Speaker 0: the first few volumes are about red the original Pokemon guy

738
00:39:47,689 --> 00:39:47,749
Speaker 1: and

739
00:39:48,772 --> 00:40:01,110
Speaker 0: then you read yellow Caballero which comes after that and Red is now sort of like this mysterious legendary figure But you know all about him because you read those other volumes, but now he's all legendary and mysterious, and it's totally awesome.

740
00:40:01,253 --> 00:40:01,848
Speaker 0: I love that shit.

741
00:40:02,472 --> 00:40:04,860
Speaker 0: You know I think that other stories need to do more.

742
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:10,850
Speaker 0: that like you know you read Lord of the Rings and Merlin is sort Of he's there, but he's still sort of mysterious, right?

743
00:40:11,350 --> 00:40:16,848
Speaker 0: They should have had the story of Merlin first and then do the Lord of the Rings where Merlin's all mysterious.

744
00:40:16,888 --> 00:40:20,082
Speaker 0: that way You get that same feeling you get in Pokemon Earthsea.

745
00:40:20,645 --> 00:40:21,348
Speaker 1: Well regardless.

746
00:40:21,408 --> 00:40:27,747
Speaker 1: I just The game and the comic give me the same feeling actually that earthbound does.

747
00:40:27,787 --> 00:40:28,489
Speaker 1: there's this very.

748
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:38,330
Speaker 1: you know Earthbound is very Pokemon it is But just the idea the journey of the child through the adult world through the eyes of a child and with the priorities of a child.

749
00:40:38,832 --> 00:40:45,194
Speaker 1: But yet, it's an adult world that the child is traveling through and that Mystique to a child.

750
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:51,957
Speaker 1: I think that is what made Pokemon and earthbound while mother just so amazingly Transcendently popular among kids.

751
00:40:52,038 --> 00:40:55,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, what else is pretty great about this Pokemon?

752
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:57,035
Speaker 0: Right is that you look at some of the other Pokemon.

753
00:40:57,055 --> 00:41:01,750
Speaker 0: things like especially Pokemon movies concentrate a lot on the Pokemon themselves.

754
00:41:01,891 --> 00:41:03,583
Speaker 0: You know on the monsters and catching them all.

755
00:41:03,623 --> 00:41:04,469
Speaker 1: he's got Gyarados.

756
00:41:04,489 --> 00:41:06,679
Speaker 1: well I have squirtles and I'll do the blah.

757
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,990
Speaker 0: or even like you'll see scenes where it's just Pokemon.

758
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:10,054
Speaker 0: There's no people around.

759
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:12,223
Speaker 0: this is all about the people.

760
00:41:12,283 --> 00:41:14,010
Speaker 0: the Pokemon are just sort of there.

761
00:41:14,351 --> 00:41:16,017
Speaker 0: You know it's sort of like.

762
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:19,830
Speaker 0: you know I don't know, but it's that it's about the trainers.

763
00:41:19,991 --> 00:41:22,410
Speaker 0: It's all about the trainers the trainers of the main characters.

764
00:41:22,832 --> 00:41:24,860
Speaker 0: It's all about them and the people they talk to.

765
00:41:25,201 --> 00:41:29,870
Speaker 0: the Pokemon are there and they are characters But they're not the primary characters.

766
00:41:29,930 --> 00:41:35,819
Speaker 0: They're always like off to the side a little bit, and they'll do awesome stuff with the Pokemon You know, but they're really.

767
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:39,930
Speaker 0: they sort of take the place of the cute pet You know like Akumako or something like that.

768
00:41:40,010 --> 00:41:40,573
Speaker 0: You know where they have.

769
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:46,877
Speaker 0: you know hilarious scenes when they do something and they say funny things and do funny things But they're not the characters.

770
00:41:46,917 --> 00:41:48,964
Speaker 0: you're not like following the adventure of Pikachu.

771
00:41:49,024 --> 00:41:50,068
Speaker 0: It's the adventure of red.

772
00:41:50,108 --> 00:41:50,750
Speaker 0: It's about red.

773
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,056
Speaker 0: It's about the yellow Caballero.

774
00:41:52,076 --> 00:41:58,430
Speaker 0: It's about green and Gary and Professor Oak and those people and You know that's what I want to see is I want to see a story about people.

775
00:41:58,490 --> 00:41:59,675
Speaker 0: I don't want to see story about.

776
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:03,450
Speaker 0: you know cute monsters right, but you know the cute monsters.

777
00:42:03,470 --> 00:42:07,730
Speaker 0: They're still there, and they still provide awesome moments and a rim loves his Bulbasaur.

778
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:09,496
Speaker 1: Oh my god, Bulbasaur is just.

779
00:42:09,516 --> 00:42:13,388
Speaker 1: I don't think you guys understand how hardcore Bulbasaur is.

780
00:42:13,689 --> 00:42:25,357
Speaker 0: yeah and you know there's all sorts of like funny situations like when they're Pokemon get mixed up or Like you know and like yes the ride on the Gyrodos or whatever and he goes in the water And he's like oh shit.

781
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,586
Speaker 0: Oh shit surf.

782
00:42:26,686 --> 00:42:27,089
Speaker 0: Oh crap.

783
00:42:27,832 --> 00:42:30,321
Speaker 1: Probably my favorite parts though are all toward the end.

784
00:42:30,341 --> 00:42:34,854
Speaker 1: You know Team Rocket is a serious scary Pseudoterrorist organization.

785
00:42:34,934 --> 00:42:35,958
Speaker 0: yeah, that's what I love that.

786
00:42:36,119 --> 00:42:39,250
Speaker 1: and Giovanni is one scary badass motherfucker.

787
00:42:39,491 --> 00:42:40,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, Jesus.

788
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,842
Speaker 0: He actually appears here in volume two.

789
00:42:43,183 --> 00:42:43,604
Speaker 0: is it great?

790
00:42:43,624 --> 00:42:49,387
Speaker 0: because he goes and he talks to our red And he just sort of walks around with red like all normal like pretending to be friendly.

791
00:42:49,407 --> 00:42:51,735
Speaker 0: it reminds Hard.

792
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:57,610
Speaker 0: yeah, then after red walks away He sort of like pulls his coat back, and you can see the letter R on his vest.

793
00:42:58,092 --> 00:43:00,100
Speaker 0: It's all stylish, and it's like oh shit.

794
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:01,023
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

795
00:43:01,385 --> 00:43:01,847
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

796
00:43:01,967 --> 00:43:08,978
Speaker 1: He's Team Rocket Oh, but the fact that Team Rocket is more like this mafia organization like this evil That's the thing seriously evil.

797
00:43:09,018 --> 00:43:18,043
Speaker 0: if you look to Team Rocket in the original video game You know you didn't know much about them other than that they were bad guys and what they looked like and they all looked Like bad guys.

798
00:43:18,063 --> 00:43:21,564
Speaker 0: they would wear black You know evil kind of suits, and they'd be up to no good.

799
00:43:21,584 --> 00:43:24,480
Speaker 0: and in the manga They're even more evil and up to even more.

800
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,948
Speaker 1: no, but they're up to realistic.

801
00:43:26,008 --> 00:43:27,154
Speaker 1: No good They're trying to do.

802
00:43:27,475 --> 00:43:30,550
Speaker 1: you know the kinds of things that mafias do just in a world where they're a Pokemon.

803
00:43:30,671 --> 00:43:39,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, they want to get Pokemon and make them all powerful And and you know do all sorts of evil stuff with them take over towns and smash things and threaten people and you know all That sort of evil stuff.

804
00:43:39,854 --> 00:43:41,280
Speaker 0: They have an evil corporation.

805
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,645
Speaker 0: That's a front for their mafia.

806
00:43:42,665 --> 00:43:53,050
Speaker 1: miss yep This manga is at least the beginning of it The story of red and his you know youthful idealism and him fighting against Team Rocket And it culminates in the like the whole story.

807
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:55,381
Speaker 0: He's just trying to become like you know like the.

808
00:43:55,542 --> 00:43:57,090
Speaker 0: you know this great Pokemon train.

809
00:43:57,170 --> 00:44:06,662
Speaker 0: Yes, but he gets embroiled get all the badges, but then you know along the way He can't help but keep bumping into Team Rocket And then Team Rocket's coming after him at the same time and so it's a big mess.

810
00:44:07,084 --> 00:44:12,767
Speaker 1: it just I like the whole the first Saga how that all ends with Giovanni and him and everything is just amazing.

811
00:44:13,048 --> 00:44:13,510
Speaker 0: It's very me.

812
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,639
Speaker 1: This is a good manga, and I shall just read it.

813
00:44:15,699 --> 00:44:18,130
Speaker 0: I mean it's Viz kids right, but don't be put off.

814
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,407
Speaker 0: I mean it is appropriate for kids obviously, but don't be thinking.

815
00:44:21,447 --> 00:44:21,930
Speaker 0: It's kiddie.

816
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:31,390
Speaker 0: I mean there's shit going down in here like people's getting arms get chopped off or like Pokemon get cut up And they bite people and it's it's friggin hard dangerous world.

817
00:44:32,033 --> 00:44:32,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean friggin.

818
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:34,143
Speaker 0: as a giant Pokemon.

819
00:44:34,183 --> 00:44:37,950
Speaker 0: if it steps on you You're dead, but the thing is don't be fooled.

820
00:44:37,950 --> 00:44:49,289
Speaker 1: You know when you've just start reading the manga the first volume it starts out on the same level I'd say as that Legend of Zelda manga like it's kind of light-hearted, and it is kind of kiddie at first And it it's also of his kids title.

821
00:44:49,309 --> 00:44:54,209
Speaker 1: yeah But it definitely progresses and progresses and gets darker and more serious and more cool as time goes on.

822
00:44:54,269 --> 00:45:00,115
Speaker 1: and By the end of the first story arc with red and then when you move on to yellow You'll see what we're talking about.

823
00:45:00,135 --> 00:45:01,540
Speaker 1: you'll see why we like this so much.

824
00:45:01,841 --> 00:45:09,920
Speaker 0: the other thing is that plot wise it skips over a Lot of sort of like the fiddly BS that like other Pokemon things will pay attention to right like you.

825
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:12,170
Speaker 0: don't see him catch every single freaking Pokemon.

826
00:45:12,311 --> 00:45:14,079
Speaker 0: You know it's like they'll sort of skip ahead.

827
00:45:14,099 --> 00:45:14,400
Speaker 0: He's like.

828
00:45:14,681 --> 00:45:14,882
Speaker 0: You know.

829
00:45:14,962 --> 00:45:17,650
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, this you know I you know There'll be one chapter.

830
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:18,916
Speaker 0: He's got like three Pokemon.

831
00:45:18,956 --> 00:45:21,890
Speaker 0: the next chapter have like eight and you'll see ones that weren't there.

832
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:24,742
Speaker 0: You just sort of assume that he caught them in the meantime, and he did.

833
00:45:25,144 --> 00:45:26,650
Speaker 0: and that's that you don't need to see that.

834
00:45:26,832 --> 00:45:28,009
Speaker 0: You know what's the what's the deal?

835
00:45:28,611 --> 00:45:35,945
Speaker 0: You know it moves in a very nice pace as a result as opposed to getting bogged up And you know where you watch him throw a bokeh ball.

836
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:36,629
Speaker 0: It didn't work.

837
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:38,275
Speaker 0: Pokeball didn't work.

838
00:45:38,698 --> 00:45:40,508
Speaker 0: You know you don't have that sort of stuff going on.

839
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:44,590
Speaker 0: So yeah Pokemon adventures don't get the wrong one.

840
00:45:45,212 --> 00:46:01,847
