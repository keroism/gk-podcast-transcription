1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,577
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday March 22nd, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,597 --> 00:00:16,639
Speaker 0: We talk about Hansuki and tactical roar.

3
00:00:17,642 --> 00:00:20,969
Speaker 0: Let's do this So every day this week.

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,680
Speaker 0: I'm going over a few reminders.

5
00:00:23,724 --> 00:00:27,260
Speaker 0: the first reminder is You should go to our website.

6
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:34,849
Speaker 0: I know a lot of people out there like found our feed via some podcast director your iTunes or something and You're not actually going to our website.

7
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:38,449
Speaker 0: It's front row crew Dot-com.

8
00:00:39,234 --> 00:00:46,540
Speaker 0: if you go there There's a forum where there's lots of fun talking going on and arguing and awesomeness.

9
00:00:48,242 --> 00:00:49,146
Speaker 0: You could just join that.

10
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:51,435
Speaker 0: there's a little link there, but if you want to go right to it.

11
00:00:51,516 --> 00:00:55,196
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's www.front row crew.com slash forum.

12
00:00:55,699 --> 00:01:00,900
Speaker 1: also Don't forget that we have five separate feeds one for each day of the week and one for all days of the week.

13
00:01:01,522 --> 00:01:13,176
Speaker 0: Yep, so if you only like video games you can subscribe to just Tuesday And if you like video games and anime you can subscribe to Tuesday and Wednesday And if you like all of geek nights, you should just subscribe to the one feed.

14
00:01:13,197 --> 00:01:16,835
Speaker 1: that gives you everything Yeah, and thus you can stop asking us for that feature.

15
00:01:17,357 --> 00:01:26,368
Speaker 0: Yes, and Lastly we have this cool frapper map which lets everyone who listens to eat nights put a little pin on the map to show us Where you are.

16
00:01:26,469 --> 00:01:26,611
Speaker 0: it's?

17
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:34,529
Speaker 1: www.frapper.com/frontrowcrew And we seem to have a listener in what.

18
00:01:34,569 --> 00:01:36,155
Speaker 0: Norway Norway.

19
00:01:36,255 --> 00:01:37,399
Speaker 1: so hello, Norway.

20
00:01:39,361 --> 00:01:42,291
Speaker 0: Your timezone is very distant from our timezone.

21
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:44,539
Speaker 0: I wonder if it is night or day when you are listening.

22
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:51,300
Speaker 1: So anyway, we only have one actual news for the rest of the world today because the other news is more.

23
00:01:52,148 --> 00:01:52,755
Speaker 1: Well, well, you'll see.

24
00:01:55,137 --> 00:01:58,859
Speaker 0: So Google has this thing they're working on called.

25
00:01:59,161 --> 00:02:01,651
Speaker 0: Well, you probably all use Gmail or know about it.

26
00:02:01,932 --> 00:02:06,230
Speaker 0: and if you don't know about it Well, we have a zillion bajillion invites.

27
00:02:06,391 --> 00:02:08,340
Speaker 0: so we can get you Gmail if you want.

28
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:10,844
Speaker 0: It's pretty much the best web-based email there is.

29
00:02:11,305 --> 00:02:12,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're not evil like Yahoo.

30
00:02:12,888 --> 00:02:20,960
Speaker 0: So yep, and Basically on our hosting I was running a real email server like real.

31
00:02:21,722 --> 00:02:28,101
Speaker 0: The problem was that's not easy even for a technical guy like me and I couldn't get certain features to work Like.

32
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:31,830
Speaker 0: I have like three domains like this mod.

33
00:02:31,870 --> 00:02:34,958
Speaker 0: This is my personal domain this front row crew.com.

34
00:02:36,242 --> 00:02:37,005
Speaker 0: We got some other don't?

35
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,651
Speaker 0: we got two other domains on the machine.

36
00:02:38,671 --> 00:02:39,815
Speaker 1: Yep, a thief rabbit.

37
00:02:39,936 --> 00:02:45,173
Speaker 0: Yeah mid husband gamers Yeah, but we couldn't get email for all the domains.

38
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:47,440
Speaker 0: You can only get email to work for one domain now.

39
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,308
Speaker 0: It's not technologically impossible.

40
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,960
Speaker 0: It's just difficult and it's not worth the effort.

41
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:58,250
Speaker 0: So when Google announced they were gonna have Gmail for domains I signed up for that beta.

42
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:07,389
Speaker 1: now what that means is Instead of pointing our DNS record, you know, the MX record for those of you who know You add our email server.

43
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,520
Speaker 1: We point it at Google and then Google takes care of our email.

44
00:03:11,002 --> 00:03:25,620
Speaker 0: so basically Google has the email server that runs Gmail and All the emails that are meant for us that would normally come to our server Instead goes to Google server and when they show up there Google puts them in our Gmail accounts.

45
00:03:26,304 --> 00:03:30,688
Speaker 1: So now instead of geek nights at gmail.com We're geek nights at front row crew.

46
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:37,818
Speaker 0: calm as you would expect but on our end We're using Gmail even though you're sending the mail to front row crew.

47
00:03:37,838 --> 00:03:40,224
Speaker 0: calm It's Gmail for us.

48
00:03:40,424 --> 00:03:40,825
Speaker 1: Whoo.

49
00:03:41,307 --> 00:03:44,075
Speaker 1: Now this feature isn't widely available to the public yet.

50
00:03:44,095 --> 00:03:45,900
Speaker 1: We're inside of the beta.

51
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:56,559
Speaker 0: Yeah I signed up for the beta as soon as they announced it and that they just sent me the email allowing me access today and About a minute after he got that email we went nuts playing around inside it.

52
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:07,531
Speaker 0: It's basically just Gmail with a few little bits on top and the only thing wrong with it that I can tell so far Is that you can't use the Gmail notification thing though?

53
00:04:07,611 --> 00:04:10,760
Speaker 1: I'm sure someone soon will write a new one or fix that one.

54
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,386
Speaker 0: I'm sure it'll be fixed rather quickly.

55
00:04:12,667 --> 00:04:13,349
Speaker 0: This isn't you know?

56
00:04:13,871 --> 00:04:13,992
Speaker 0: now?

57
00:04:14,012 --> 00:04:16,100
Speaker 0: apparently this beta was expanded today.

58
00:04:16,642 --> 00:04:17,124
Speaker 1: That's cool.

59
00:04:17,947 --> 00:04:19,313
Speaker 1: And it just it has a lot of neat features.

60
00:04:19,654 --> 00:04:26,240
Speaker 1: as far we can make aliases Meaning I can have my account and then I can make a whole bunch of different names that all point at the same account.

61
00:04:26,742 --> 00:04:31,679
Speaker 0: Well, oh the all the all the advanced features are for the administrator of the domain, which is me.

62
00:04:32,121 --> 00:04:36,540
Speaker 0: Yeah users of the domain of which I can make 10 total users because it's free.

63
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:42,303
Speaker 0: I guess if I wanted to be able to make more than 10 users out to pay money or something or maybe it's because it's A beta right now.

64
00:04:42,323 --> 00:04:46,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think in the future what they're gonna do is gonna charge money for more users and stuff.

65
00:04:46,862 --> 00:04:52,540
Speaker 0: But the administrator the domain can do all sorts of fancy stuff and all the users are just users.

66
00:04:53,302 --> 00:05:04,738
Speaker 0: but like you can rebrand the the mail and then like the idea is that you can sell it to You know other people as if it was your own mail type of thing, you know with your domain.

67
00:05:04,758 --> 00:05:05,260
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

68
00:05:05,582 --> 00:05:11,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you had a domain that was worth selling Yeah, and I read the EULA carefully because there's a lot of potential for badness.

69
00:05:11,962 --> 00:05:26,684
Speaker 0: But the EULA pretty much said this is the EULA of Gmail, but the only other thing we're adding to it is like all Users are considered customers of you and customers of Google and I'm like, alright sure Whatever who cares.

70
00:05:27,688 --> 00:05:35,356
Speaker 1: and of course, this isn't really specific to this new Gmail domain thing But Gmail in general for those of you who use it, but don't really use it.

71
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:40,460
Speaker 1: Well There are a lot of very cool features in there that you can play around with.

72
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:53,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, Gmail has fancy stuff like labeling and and yeah Like now if an email gets sent to geek nights at Gmail or geek nights at front row crew It goes to both Scott and I On our own email accounts.

73
00:05:54,167 --> 00:05:56,856
Speaker 1: In fact for me, it goes into a special folder called geek nights.

74
00:05:57,378 --> 00:05:57,619
Speaker 0: Yep.

75
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:57,920
Speaker 0: Me too.

76
00:05:58,161 --> 00:05:59,847
Speaker 0: Well, it gets labeled geek night.

77
00:05:59,907 --> 00:06:03,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, which works like a folder but also it you know what player.

78
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,410
Speaker 0: It's more like a tag and delicious than a folder.

79
00:06:05,671 --> 00:06:07,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still cool.

80
00:06:08,363 --> 00:06:12,838
Speaker 0: So if you're not using Gmail and you're using some crummy old-school email type of thing.

81
00:06:12,878 --> 00:06:13,440
Speaker 0: what's wrong with you?

82
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:19,080
Speaker 0: Oh also Gmail has chat you can and the chat in Gmail is hooked up to jabber which we use anyway.

83
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:24,262
Speaker 0: So it's kind of like ooh integrate everything It's all good.

84
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:25,084
Speaker 1: Yep.

85
00:06:25,866 --> 00:06:30,659
Speaker 1: Now before any of you ask no, we're not giving everyone email addresses at front row crew.

86
00:06:30,679 --> 00:06:35,365
Speaker 0: calm No, we only have ten and we've already used Two or three.

87
00:06:35,787 --> 00:06:42,373
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the original I guess actual front row crew Which I don't think we've ever actually explained what the front row crew is.

88
00:06:42,393 --> 00:06:44,000
Speaker 0: You could do a whole episode about that.

89
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,676
Speaker 1: I think we will someday but I guess the actual members of the front row crew get first dibs on this.

90
00:06:49,078 --> 00:06:59,679
Speaker 0: Yeah Right now I'm gonna use it mostly for business matters and not so much personal matter And once the business matters are taken care of then the other things can then you know.

91
00:07:00,322 --> 00:07:03,980
Speaker 1: So in actual news, there's a group and this has been on slash down.

92
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:08,980
Speaker 1: It was actually reported a while ago, but it was reported again today, and I decided that it's something worth talking about.

93
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:20,779
Speaker 1: They are suing Target stores their online presence because they are not as Blind or otherwise disability compliant as these people would like them to be.

94
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:25,333
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and it might sound simple, you know ADA and such.

95
00:07:25,554 --> 00:07:27,300
Speaker 1: Oh, well, you should accommodate people with disabilities.

96
00:07:27,922 --> 00:07:36,658
Speaker 1: The internet makes it a whole lot trickier than it is in the real world to enforce or manage that sort of thing and There's really no easy answer here.

97
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:45,146
Speaker 0: I mean imagine trying to use your computer where instead of a monitor you just have speakers that read stuff to you and then You have a Braille keyboard.

98
00:07:45,206 --> 00:07:54,135
Speaker 0: It's not easy and you know when the internet isn't designed For not having a monitor and people don't specifically accommodate you.

99
00:07:54,276 --> 00:07:58,880
Speaker 0: with your special situation It's pretty much nearly impossible to do anything efficiently.

100
00:07:59,624 --> 00:08:11,158
Speaker 1: I mean the worst part is that a lot of people on both sides of the debate I mean there are half the people who say it's impossible and we shouldn't even try and a lot of people who say that you must it you have to accommodate people.

101
00:08:11,179 --> 00:08:32,937
Speaker 1: and Actually, it's that latter group that I'm more worried about because they're trying to push forth legislation and they've been doing this for a long time that would require websites as in all websites to meet certain usability standards and it's my opinion that most of these usability standards are either impossible difficult or just stupid to force people to do I

102
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:40,539
Speaker 0: Think what they should do is if you're a company with a website that sells stuff, right?

103
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:56,319
Speaker 0: You know, it's like You have enough money that you can afford to pay someone to make like a different Usable version of your site or something like that or in the very least if you've got phone orders instead.

104
00:08:57,561 --> 00:08:59,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you could just have.

105
00:08:59,930 --> 00:09:01,637
Speaker 0: you know the website they go.

106
00:09:01,677 --> 00:09:10,720
Speaker 0: if they go to it They can read them off what's there and then if they can't Successfully make an order because they can't click on an image link or some who knows, you know, they call on the telephone.

107
00:09:10,981 --> 00:09:14,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a lot of these laws people want pests that would force all websites to comply.

108
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:16,308
Speaker 1: I mean, what have you put up?

109
00:09:16,368 --> 00:09:18,380
Speaker 1: an artsy cool flash animation site?

110
00:09:18,863 --> 00:09:20,979
Speaker 1: There's no way a blind person can use that site.

111
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:25,594
Speaker 0: Yeah flash is pretty much impossible for blind people to use absolutely impossible flash.

112
00:09:25,695 --> 00:09:29,165
Speaker 1: any site that uses a lot of JavaScript to move stuff around or navigate.

113
00:09:29,466 --> 00:09:32,154
Speaker 0: Yeah blind people cannot use homestar runner now.

114
00:09:32,274 --> 00:09:36,974
Speaker 1: actually there's a big problem now That's arising with captchas the little.

115
00:09:36,994 --> 00:09:47,960
Speaker 1: now for those of you don't know You know a lot of times when you sign up for a forum or a blog or whatever when you're making the account It'll ask you to repeat some characters that are written in a text image.

116
00:09:48,182 --> 00:09:51,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll be like a picture with some letters in it But the letters will be all funky.

117
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:55,077
Speaker 0: so like a computer couldn't read the letters only a person can read the letters.

118
00:09:55,699 --> 00:09:55,880
Speaker 1: now.

119
00:09:56,061 --> 00:09:56,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's great.

120
00:09:56,604 --> 00:09:58,815
Speaker 1: It keeps spammers out and I'm actually a big fan of that.

121
00:09:58,835 --> 00:09:59,317
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

122
00:09:59,478 --> 00:10:02,157
Speaker 1: However What's a blind person to do?

123
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:13,459
Speaker 0: Actually, well on Google the Google has captchas But every Google capture has a little button next to it that will speak the words out loud if you click on it.

124
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:20,120
Speaker 1: And I've seen other places that have just have an email link where you can email the administrator if you are blind or whatnot.

125
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:23,659
Speaker 1: Yep, but there are a lot of sites out there that just don't implement anything.

126
00:10:24,462 --> 00:10:26,530
Speaker 0: Actually, I have one forum.

127
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:29,140
Speaker 0: I'm in for the comic book comic geek speak podcast.

128
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:31,849
Speaker 0: Whenever you log in you have to do a capture.

129
00:10:32,050 --> 00:10:32,351
Speaker 0: What?

130
00:10:32,652 --> 00:10:33,857
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty annoying.

131
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:34,720
Speaker 0: That's silly.

132
00:10:35,062 --> 00:10:36,756
Speaker 0: the thing is is it okay?

133
00:10:36,816 --> 00:10:39,717
Speaker 0: because Blind people can't read comic books.

134
00:10:40,863 --> 00:10:44,740
Speaker 0: So there aren't too many blind people in the comic geek speak forums.

135
00:10:46,501 --> 00:10:49,516
Speaker 1: Actually, I know there are a lot of blind people who are really into podcasting.

136
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:56,200
Speaker 0: Oh Podcasting is like the best thing ever for blind people because RSS feeds are really easy to read with.

137
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,820
Speaker 0: You know things for blind people and downloading in b3s and playing them is real easy for blind.

138
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:03,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, not so popular with deaf people.

139
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:06,684
Speaker 0: I hear no Like in the podcast.

140
00:11:06,725 --> 00:11:12,600
Speaker 0: deaf people definitely much more liking the the video casts and the you know websites the blogs.

141
00:11:13,145 --> 00:11:17,279
Speaker 1: See, I guess the my my main Idea here is that like the ADA?

142
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:27,800
Speaker 1: I mean, it's basically a yes You should try to accommodate as many people as you can wherever possible without undue hardship And people have to keep the undue hardship idea in mind.

143
00:11:27,941 --> 00:11:37,580
Speaker 1: I mean just because if I make some fun website just for myself Should I be forced legally to spend the time and the effort to make it compliant to every possible disability out there?

144
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it would be easier for me to just shut down the site.

145
00:11:41,263 --> 00:11:51,900
Speaker 0: I mean if the ADA is kind of like PETA if they had their way Then like every single building and every single business in the entire world would have an accommodation for every single disability ever.

146
00:11:52,021 --> 00:11:53,388
Speaker 0: It's just not feasible.

147
00:11:53,428 --> 00:12:00,300
Speaker 0: I mean, you know what every single like Raised Building needs to have like a handicap lift the handy.

148
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:00,962
Speaker 0: It's like.

149
00:12:01,424 --> 00:12:12,851
Speaker 0: I think what's happening is the people who make like ramps and all those You know crutches and wheelchairs and all those sorts of handicap Equipment are like ADA lobbyists to try to get more.

150
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:15,580
Speaker 1: You realize the ADA is an act not a group.

151
00:12:17,622 --> 00:12:19,568
Speaker 1: There may also be a group but I know the group

152
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:20,069
Speaker 0: that these

153
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:33,492
Speaker 1: players the the disabilities act and that's the main thing here because it One thing I agree with the many things the access because fronting it mandates that all new buildings have to include certain basic easy to Implement things like ramps wide doors wide elevators.

154
00:12:33,532 --> 00:12:34,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

155
00:12:34,437 --> 00:12:35,100
Speaker 1: I say that's great.

156
00:12:35,501 --> 00:12:43,669
Speaker 1: The problem is when they if you try to enforce and luckily this hasn't been done on say you have an old building a historical Building there's no way to update a building like that.

157
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,720
Speaker 0: Nope without destroying the building or something.

158
00:12:46,943 --> 00:12:48,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, RIT got hit with that.

159
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:55,459
Speaker 1: There's a room at our college that's up a tiny spiral staircase and they used to have like dinners and ball Not really balls, but like fancy dinners up there.

160
00:12:55,842 --> 00:13:08,260
Speaker 1: it's at the top of a tower and has a nice window out to the campus and They were forced to shut it down because they couldn't make it compliant because the building was built after the act and This room was not accessible via elevators.

161
00:13:10,643 --> 00:13:13,120
Speaker 1: The room yeah, there's a storage room now for janitors.

162
00:13:13,782 --> 00:13:18,136
Speaker 0: Why couldn't they just make the room something that handicapped people don't want to do like that.

163
00:13:18,156 --> 00:13:19,380
Speaker 1: You can't that's how the law works.

164
00:13:20,069 --> 00:13:24,528
Speaker 1: It's so silly Yeah, but then again It's kind of like the evidence laws in court.

165
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:31,316
Speaker 1: if there's no penalty for not following it then people just would say oops Sorry, we didn't mean to not follow it, but it's too late.

166
00:13:31,356 --> 00:13:33,102
Speaker 1: Now the building's built ha ha ha.

167
00:13:33,223 --> 00:13:49,120
Speaker 0: I mean it's okay if you don't have a handicap accessible ramp to get into the gymnastics room because They can't use the gymnastics room, you know It's not okay to have say no ramp to go to the bowling alley because handicapped people like bowling.

168
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,445
Speaker 1: Well, what about the gymnastics room?

169
00:13:50,465 --> 00:13:53,636
Speaker 1: I mean, what if someone who's handicapped wants to watch gymnastics?

170
00:13:54,780 --> 00:14:04,190
Speaker 0: Oh if it's like a Gymnastics, you know arena with seats and everything then of course they have to get it, you know I'm talking about like the gym where people go to practice.

171
00:14:04,612 --> 00:14:06,158
Speaker 1: I guess I mean, I don't have an answer.

172
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:17,700
Speaker 1: either way it's just there's a very fine line between protecting the rights of handicapped disabled people to interact with society and Protecting the rights of people to do and build whatever they want to do.

173
00:14:18,462 --> 00:14:19,465
Speaker 1: Yep, and the internet.

174
00:14:19,545 --> 00:14:24,078
Speaker 1: this is a thousand times more because anyone it's not like anyone can't just build a building.

175
00:14:24,178 --> 00:14:28,700
Speaker 1: you need money You need resources and you at you were forced to consider a lot of these things.

176
00:14:29,061 --> 00:14:36,380
Speaker 1: You don't need anything to build a website and I'd say that at least 80% of the internet out There is not in any way accessible to handicapped individuals.

177
00:14:37,085 --> 00:14:48,900
Speaker 0: I think what people should just do is You know if you decide that you want to make your stuff accessible to blind people and you know You're gonna get a lot of benefit from all the buying blind people who flock to your website.

178
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:49,803
Speaker 1: That's what I say.

179
00:14:49,864 --> 00:14:51,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so it's just.

180
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:54,160
Speaker 0: you don't need any law to encourage you to do it.

181
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:56,880
Speaker 0: It's just if you want blind people to come to your website do it.

182
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:01,099
Speaker 0: If you don't want them to come don't and you'll suffer or be better for it.

183
00:15:01,421 --> 00:15:19,366
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess in my eyes the only websites that should be required by law to accommodate these sorts of things government websites public services websites or any website that maybe not be run by the government but like libraries the way the the postal services website Yeah, the.

184
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:23,000
Speaker 0: the financial aid website non-commercial products and services.

185
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:28,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sort of thing definitely has to be accessible and standards compliant and all that.

186
00:15:28,982 --> 00:15:34,982
Speaker 1: I guess the only reason I bring it up is that I've been seeing this issue appearing more and more and one.

187
00:15:35,283 --> 00:15:47,680
Speaker 1: most people who design websites for companies just don't care about it at all and then the company's get in trouble or The legislation keeps getting pushed and someday this sort of thing might get passed and then the Internet's in for a rude awakening.

188
00:15:48,121 --> 00:16:08,500
Speaker 0: It's actually really Microsoft's fault because Internet Explorer and you know not being good about standards or anything, you know It just so happens that well-written websites that follow the standards and you know Have nice CSS and all that jazz are actually much easier for blind people to use than websites Made to work in IE and not any other breath.

189
00:16:08,821 --> 00:16:20,239
Speaker 1: The problem is most corporate websites now at least most of the crap you want to splash crap all over either that or they're designed by some guy in Dreamweaver because Honestly, there really aren't any good gooey tools for building CSS.

190
00:16:20,641 --> 00:16:20,963
Speaker 0: You know what?

191
00:16:20,983 --> 00:16:23,839
Speaker 0: It's called hire a designer who doesn't suck.

192
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,003
Speaker 0: There's plenty of them.

193
00:16:25,043 --> 00:16:30,980
Speaker 0: go around to like any of those CSS websites and you see the million amazing designs that are perfectly compliant.

194
00:16:31,282 --> 00:16:33,195
Speaker 1: Hire those people but they don't want to pay for that.

195
00:16:33,215 --> 00:16:43,079
Speaker 1: Oh But If there's no reason to pay for that I mean if the only people who care are nerds like us who raise a fury but nothing comes of it.

196
00:16:44,144 --> 00:16:44,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, we'll see.

197
00:16:44,949 --> 00:16:46,539
Speaker 0: when ie7 comes out what happens.

198
00:16:48,347 --> 00:16:48,717
Speaker 0: We'll see.

199
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:53,254
Speaker 1: Well, I did see the news that ie7 is completely separated from Explorer.

200
00:16:53,274 --> 00:16:54,880
Speaker 1: now, apparently I didn't actually read the article.

201
00:16:55,061 --> 00:16:55,764
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

202
00:16:56,609 --> 00:16:57,935
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll talk about that another day.

203
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:09,609
Speaker 1: Yeah So my thing of the day is a interesting study we found on eSolutions data.

204
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:12,175
Speaker 0: Yeah so check out this scientific study.

205
00:17:12,236 --> 00:17:13,058
Speaker 0: eSolutions did.

206
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:20,609
Speaker 0: they took a bunch of old people and they brought them into a room full of Computers and they had them try out all these different operating systems.

207
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:27,047
Speaker 0: And when they tried them out, they filled out a little form You know that said what you liked about it and rated things from 1 to 10 and all that jazz.

208
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:34,790
Speaker 1: now one operating system came away with 72% of the users in terms of you know them saying it's the best one or the easiest to use.

209
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:36,075
Speaker 0: One really?

210
00:17:36,095 --> 00:17:37,962
Speaker 0: Yeah, which one would that be?

211
00:17:38,122 --> 00:17:40,070
Speaker 1: far and away senior citizens prefer.

212
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:42,533
Speaker 1: Prefer Linux.

213
00:17:43,094 --> 00:17:44,980
Speaker 0: Wow, were they using gnome or KDE?

214
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:46,305
Speaker 1: It actually doesn't say.

215
00:17:46,325 --> 00:17:50,942
Speaker 1: oh, that's kind of sad though Doss actually comes in with 14% right after it.

216
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:52,669
Speaker 0: really how did Doss come in?

217
00:17:52,689 --> 00:17:52,930
Speaker 0: second?

218
00:17:53,090 --> 00:17:54,359
Speaker 0: How do people even know how to use that?

219
00:17:54,581 --> 00:17:54,883
Speaker 1: I don't know.

220
00:17:54,904 --> 00:17:55,730
Speaker 1: They must have had it set up.

221
00:17:55,770 --> 00:17:56,999
Speaker 1: They must have some old-school guy.

222
00:17:57,019 --> 00:17:58,329
Speaker 1: I imagine it was at least off six.

223
00:17:58,972 --> 00:18:00,540
Speaker 0: Maybe they had directions or something.

224
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:04,849
Speaker 0: maybe because it's so simple and you know A lot of flashy colors to scare the old people away.

225
00:18:05,811 --> 00:18:08,922
Speaker 1: Yeah, Windows 2003 server just barely edged out BoS.

226
00:18:09,584 --> 00:18:11,210
Speaker 1: I don't know where they got a copy of BoS.

227
00:18:11,471 --> 00:18:13,360
Speaker 0: I don't know why they even tried BoS.

228
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:15,209
Speaker 0: No one even considered using that for real.

229
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:19,730
Speaker 1: Well, maybe they got a BoS because the study was a BS.

230
00:18:20,493 --> 00:18:20,894
Speaker 0: You think.

231
00:18:21,356 --> 00:18:24,006
Speaker 1: well, you see this is why this is my thing of the day.

232
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:33,133
Speaker 1: I Made this study up just now, but if you follow the link from our website There's a very professional looking site showing you all these statistics Really?

233
00:18:33,253 --> 00:18:36,550
Speaker 0: So it's a little fake statistic generator to fool people.

234
00:18:36,801 --> 00:18:42,840
Speaker 1: Yep eSolutions data is a site where you can put in whatever statistics you want and they'll generate a really flashy look in sight.

235
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:49,709
Speaker 1: that if you don't read the fine text all over because it says It's fake all over the place, but no one really seems to look.

236
00:18:50,553 --> 00:18:52,020
Speaker 0: Everyone just looks at the picture of the.

237
00:18:52,221 --> 00:18:54,431
Speaker 0: you know, Linux 72%.

238
00:18:54,431 --> 00:18:55,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it shows.

239
00:18:55,335 --> 00:18:59,724
Speaker 1: it even shows like a picture of two people talking and it shows a graph and all these things But it's all made up.

240
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:04,141
Speaker 1: Wow people are just I got Scott with it this morning.

241
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:06,470
Speaker 0: I said cuz I got me for like a second.

242
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:08,469
Speaker 1: Yeah, I got him for like a second, but it was worth it.

243
00:19:08,551 --> 00:19:09,109
Speaker 1: I sent him one.

244
00:19:09,210 --> 00:19:12,361
Speaker 1: It was like would you give up the First Amendment for you know money?

245
00:19:12,783 --> 00:19:17,680
Speaker 1: and it showed that like two-thirds of Americans would give it Up for a thousand dollars or more and for like a second.

246
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,322
Speaker 0: I was like.

247
00:19:18,503 --> 00:19:27,809
Speaker 1: he messaged me back like no way Yeah, and then before we can reply I sent him another study proving that a hundred percent of people think he is in fact a gullible penis penis.

248
00:19:29,176 --> 00:19:36,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Everyone go make fun fake graphs and scientific studies and show them to your friends and fool them.

249
00:19:36,451 --> 00:19:40,890
Speaker 1: The best thing is you can fiddle with the URL and look at all the studies other people have put in this site.

250
00:19:40,930 --> 00:19:41,853
Speaker 1: And you know, what's scary?

251
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,261
Speaker 1: Most of them don't look like they're humorous.

252
00:19:44,522 --> 00:19:46,690
Speaker 1: They look like someone was really trying to fool someone.

253
00:19:48,013 --> 00:19:52,065
Speaker 0: I bet you it worked All right, so my thing today.

254
00:19:53,676 --> 00:19:54,690
Speaker 0: It's this cool little website.

255
00:19:54,911 --> 00:20:06,725
Speaker 0: it's flash and what it does is it gives you a picture of a part of a keyboard on a piano and You click on 10 keys any 10 keys and it ever.

256
00:20:06,745 --> 00:20:11,719
Speaker 0: the first one you click is number one And the second one you click is number two and so on.

257
00:20:12,201 --> 00:20:16,293
Speaker 0: you get to click 10 notes in total 10.

258
00:20:16,293 --> 00:20:23,670
Speaker 0: Then what it does is it goes through all the digits of pi and for every digit of pi It plays the corresponding note.

259
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:27,020
Speaker 0: so the first note that will be played is the third note you pushed.

260
00:20:27,321 --> 00:20:37,670
Speaker 0: then the first note you pushed then the four then the first again and so on for 10,000 some odd digits of pi And that result is some random sounding music.

261
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:41,465
Speaker 0: then that result is some random sounding music, but I think it'd be very interesting.

262
00:20:41,526 --> 00:20:48,710
Speaker 0: if you know Is it true that maybe no matter what combination you entered at some point during pi?

263
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:50,138
Speaker 0: There would be good sounding music?

264
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:59,089
Speaker 0: or maybe you could Purposefully try to create some good sounding music based on known numbers in pi and then get to that point to hear it?

265
00:20:59,591 --> 00:21:00,634
Speaker 0: I don't know.

266
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:06,470
Speaker 1: I could probably make fairly good music by picking sets of notes that form certain modal keys or chords.

267
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:12,363
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure if you pick like 10 notes that go well together No matter what the order is you could probably make something that sounds actually.

268
00:21:12,423 --> 00:21:14,734
Speaker 1: Scott made something while I was watching him Show me the site.

269
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:15,600
Speaker 1: that sounded all right.

270
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:15,902
Speaker 1: He took.

271
00:21:15,922 --> 00:21:22,028
Speaker 1: he just hit all the black keys which was basically just a pentatonic scale which It I most people consider it.

272
00:21:22,068 --> 00:21:22,492
Speaker 0: well I hit him.

273
00:21:22,532 --> 00:21:29,190
Speaker 0: in order is what I did is I picked Like five low black keys in a row and then five high black keys in a row.

274
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:33,054
Speaker 0: So if the number was between it was one two, three, four or five It would be low.

275
00:21:33,114 --> 00:21:35,568
Speaker 0: and if it so it's kind of either low notes or high notes.

276
00:21:35,628 --> 00:21:41,497
Speaker 1: It was like Well Scott doesn't really know anything about music.

277
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:46,496
Speaker 1: I just thought it was funny that he picked the minor and major modal pentatonic scales.

278
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:47,602
Speaker 0: No one cares.

279
00:21:47,883 --> 00:21:54,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I thought it was funny, which I think that's the reason it sounded not bad, because that the thing about that kind of scale is that there's no way to hit a wrong note.

280
00:21:55,265 --> 00:21:58,121
Speaker 1: There's no way to hit two notes next to each other that sound bad.

281
00:21:58,362 --> 00:21:59,709
Speaker 0: I just picked some random keys.

282
00:21:59,729 --> 00:22:00,191
Speaker 0: that, you know.

283
00:22:00,211 --> 00:22:01,136
Speaker 1: You picked all black keys.

284
00:22:01,177 --> 00:22:02,726
Speaker 1: There are only five black keys.

285
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:04,817
Speaker 0: No, there were, well, there were some more black keys.

286
00:22:04,838 --> 00:22:05,964
Speaker 1: There's only five black notes.

287
00:22:06,487 --> 00:22:09,201
Speaker 0: Okay, but there are more than five black keys on the keyboard.

288
00:22:09,743 --> 00:22:14,924
Speaker 1: So tonight we're reviewing two anime to go back to our classic, well, technically no.

289
00:22:15,326 --> 00:22:18,777
Speaker 1: We're reviewing one anime and previewing another one.

290
00:22:20,562 --> 00:22:26,190
Speaker 1: Now the first one, I can't believe we actually had to do this, but Scott decided he wants to say the name of it in Japanese.

291
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:26,912
Speaker 1: So, Scott?

292
00:22:27,353 --> 00:22:30,182
Speaker 0: Oh, it's "Hanbun no Tsuki ga Noboru

293
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:30,845
Speaker 0: Sora.".

294
00:22:31,346 --> 00:22:32,651
Speaker 1: Yeah, "Under the Light of the Half

295
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:32,932
Speaker 1: Moon.".

296
00:22:33,253 --> 00:22:34,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

297
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:41,386
Speaker 1: Alright, we're watching that, and "Tactical Roar," which we watched one episode of, and, uh...

298
00:22:41,506 --> 00:22:42,832
Speaker 0: We're not gonna watch another episode.

299
00:22:42,873 --> 00:22:43,476
Speaker 0: That was enough.

300
00:22:43,496 --> 00:22:44,220
Speaker 0: This is all you're gonna get.

301
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,588
Speaker 1: And you know what?

302
00:22:45,628 --> 00:22:46,010
Speaker 1: You know what?

303
00:22:46,090 --> 00:22:46,351
Speaker 1: More.

304
00:22:46,853 --> 00:22:47,697
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get more.

305
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:49,765
Speaker 1: Alright, so, uh, "The Half

306
00:22:49,805 --> 00:22:50,026
Speaker 1: Moon.".

307
00:22:50,388 --> 00:22:52,337
Speaker 1: Well, we'll call it "Half Moon," just to be quick and easy.

308
00:22:53,603 --> 00:22:56,437
Speaker 1: It's a show that I really didn't hear anything about, didn't know anything about.

309
00:22:56,497 --> 00:23:05,383
Speaker 1: We downloaded it randomly, and I expected it to be the same as all that other crap anime we've been watching lately, because we've been watching a lot of crap anime.

310
00:23:05,704 --> 00:23:09,785
Speaker 0: And starting out, when you first watch the first five minutes, it seems kinda crappy.

311
00:23:10,147 --> 00:23:12,015
Speaker 0: You know, it doesn't seem crappy, like, "Oh, this is

312
00:23:12,055 --> 00:23:12,336
Speaker 0: bad.".

313
00:23:12,377 --> 00:23:13,340
Speaker 0: It just seems kinda average.

314
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:18,021
Speaker 1: It feels run-of-the-mill, and it feels a lot like those shows that are based on dating games.

315
00:23:18,584 --> 00:23:19,910
Speaker 0: Oh, it feels a lot like that, yeah.

316
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,462
Speaker 1: The thing is, this show is actually good.

317
00:23:22,924 --> 00:23:32,410
Speaker 1: At least as far--we've seen the first four episodes, and it's not the best show in the world, but both of us like it enough to where we really want to see what happens, and we're gonna watch it all.

318
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:36,230
Speaker 0: Well, it's 'cause there's only six--I just discovered five minutes ago, there are only six episodes.

319
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:46,130
Speaker 0: And once you know what the show is about, you realize that six episodes is good for this show, as opposed to, like, "Oh, it should've had more," or something like that.

320
00:23:46,470 --> 00:23:46,610
Speaker 0: Yeah.

321
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:55,606
Speaker 0: Like, at first, I was like--I mean, just earlier, we watched Episode 4 just during dinner, and I was like, "So what, is this show gonna be 26 episodes?

322
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:57,469
Speaker 0: It should be, like, 13 or maybe even

323
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:57,670
Speaker 0: less.".

324
00:23:58,151 --> 00:24:00,096
Speaker 0: And now I find out it's six, which is perfect.

325
00:24:00,537 --> 00:24:00,738
Speaker 1: Yeah.

326
00:24:01,339 --> 00:24:08,329
Speaker 1: And the thing is, I mean, I like shows like this, but this really isn't the kind of show I would've expect Scott to care about at all, yet he's watching it with me.

327
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:10,735
Speaker 0: Well, it's not, like, my favorite show in the world.

328
00:24:10,796 --> 00:24:19,308
Speaker 0: It's pretty average, but it's better than a lot of other stuff that's out there right now, so... And it has a lot of redeeming aspects other than its main...

329
00:24:19,790 --> 00:24:28,950
Speaker 1: This is definitely a show that you can watch alone and get a lot out of it, but it's also one of those shows where, if you watch it with a crowd and an anime club, it becomes a thousand times more hysterical.

330
00:24:29,452 --> 00:24:29,772
Speaker 0: Yeah.

331
00:24:30,254 --> 00:24:31,979
Speaker 0: So, let's describe what goes on the show.

332
00:24:31,999 --> 00:24:34,767
Speaker 0: The show is about this guy who's in the hospital.

333
00:24:34,788 --> 00:24:35,550
Speaker 0: He's a teenage kid.

334
00:24:36,090 --> 00:24:36,790
Speaker 1: He's got hepatitis.

335
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:42,510
Speaker 0: He has hepatitis, which means he can walk around and do stuff, but if he tries to do too much, he'll get sick.

336
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,670
Speaker 1: Oh, you tried to do too much with it.

337
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:45,712
Speaker 0: You tried to do too much with it.

338
00:24:46,454 --> 00:24:49,400
Speaker 0: And, you know, he has to stay in the hospital till his hepatitis goes away.

339
00:24:49,480 --> 00:24:54,310
Speaker 0: Not really life-threatening unless he, you know, disobeys the doctor too much.

340
00:24:54,591 --> 00:24:56,749
Speaker 1: Or drinks the liquor the doctor tries to give him.

341
00:24:57,010 --> 00:24:57,712
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

342
00:24:58,033 --> 00:24:58,374
Speaker 0: Yeah.

343
00:24:59,216 --> 00:25:04,950
Speaker 0: So, what happens is, he misbehaves because, you know, if you're in a hospital, you're gonna be kinda bored.

344
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,020
Speaker 0: Especially, I don't know why he doesn't have a Game Boy.

345
00:25:07,041 --> 00:25:08,007
Speaker 0: This is supposed to be Japan.

346
00:25:08,047 --> 00:25:08,470
Speaker 0: What the hell?

347
00:25:08,570 --> 00:25:12,070
Speaker 1: Well, he always sneaks out and goes to his friend's house to play, uh, looks like a PlayStation.

348
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:12,692
Speaker 0: Yeah.

349
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:14,108
Speaker 0: So, um...

350
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,329
Speaker 1: Now, there's this nurse who's taking care of him, and...

351
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:17,110
Speaker 0: The nurse is funny.

352
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:19,249
Speaker 1: She's kinda mean, and mean in a funny way.

353
00:25:20,530 --> 00:25:21,789
Speaker 0: Stern, but fair.

354
00:25:23,491 --> 00:25:28,149
Speaker 1: His friend, we call him "Zebra Mask" for reasons that are best left to you watching the show.

355
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:29,255
Speaker 1: Mhm.

356
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:37,229
Speaker 1: Now, the thing is, he's in the hospital, whatever, and it could've been a typical "Oh, he meets a girl in the hospital, and then there's some crap about

357
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:37,410
Speaker 1: that.".

358
00:25:37,751 --> 00:25:41,243
Speaker 1: And he does meet a girl in the hospital, but it's not like every other show.

359
00:25:41,263 --> 00:25:43,230
Speaker 1: This girl has a terminal illness.

360
00:25:43,651 --> 00:25:45,774
Speaker 0: A really scary terminal illness.

361
00:25:45,855 --> 00:25:54,410
Speaker 0: Like, she's going to die soon unless she goes to, like, Denmark to get this rare, expensive surgery she can't afford.

362
00:25:54,890 --> 00:25:59,610
Speaker 1: And, like, the show basically tells you flat out that there's no way she's gonna be able to go and get this surgery.

363
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, this isn't, like, a spoiler.

364
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:04,938
Speaker 0: This is something they say in plain English in, like, the first or second episode.

365
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:05,939
Speaker 0: First episode, yeah.

366
00:26:13,451 --> 00:26:15,858
Speaker 1: And even if this can succeed, she won't be able to live that long.

367
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:20,010
Speaker 1: Or she can not get the operation, and she's still gonna die fairly soon.

368
00:26:20,690 --> 00:26:23,569
Speaker 1: There's really no happy way out of this.

369
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:28,847
Speaker 0: So the nurse says, "Hey, you know, if you go befriend her, then I'll be less mean to

370
00:26:28,888 --> 00:26:28,988
Speaker 0: you.".

371
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:35,990
Speaker 0: So he does, and then, you know, over the show is sorta like this, you know, little romantic, friendly kinda thing going on.

372
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:41,830
Speaker 0: And that's the plot, is this guy and this girl, this guy with hepatitis and this girl who's gonna die, hanging with each other.

373
00:26:42,211 --> 00:26:50,930
Speaker 1: The show is generally very low-key and very atmospheric, and it's more realistic than you'd think, despite the humor that crops up from time to time.

374
00:26:51,290 --> 00:26:54,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought there was gonna be some unrealistic action, but there wasn't.

375
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,910
Speaker 0: Like, I was expecting there to be some in this particular scene, but they didn't really have any.

376
00:26:58,970 --> 00:27:09,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a scene, we don't really, there's not much to spoil, but there's a thing on a ledge that, you know, up on a high building, and, you know, you expect this classic anime scene of, "Oh, almost fall, rescued, crazy,

377
00:27:09,869 --> 00:27:10,170
Speaker 1: whatever.".

378
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:11,329
Speaker 1: But no, none of that.

379
00:27:11,870 --> 00:27:13,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, it goes pretty normally.

380
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,250
Speaker 0: And there's also the best is in, like, the first episode.

381
00:27:16,311 --> 00:27:17,008
Speaker 1: Oh, the old man?

382
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:19,469
Speaker 0: There's a funny old man with a collection of porn.

383
00:27:19,810 --> 00:27:21,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, the guy's name is Tada, I think.

384
00:27:21,996 --> 00:27:22,210
Speaker 1: Yeah.

385
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:24,750
Speaker 1: And they refer to it as the Tada Collection.

386
00:27:25,331 --> 00:27:28,810
Speaker 1: He has, like, thousands of pornographic magazines and books.

387
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,870
Speaker 0: It's like this fantastic porn collection, like, amazing.

388
00:27:32,090 --> 00:27:40,050
Speaker 0: And there's a plot surrounding the porn collection that I won't spoil, but let's just say the porn collection stays around for quite a while.

389
00:27:40,171 --> 00:27:43,290
Speaker 0: And makes many important things happen in the show.

390
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:48,370
Speaker 1: As far as I'm concerned, the porn collection itself is a character independent of the people who have owned it.

391
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:52,350
Speaker 0: Well, if you're gonna say that, the porn collection is my favorite character in this show.

392
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:53,870
Speaker 1: I don't know, I like the nurse.

393
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,909
Speaker 0: The nurse is definitely the funniest.

394
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,490
Speaker 1: The only character I don't like is that frickin' doctor.

395
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,150
Speaker 0: Well, the doctor, I think, is supposed to be the bad guy.

396
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:15,690
Speaker 1: See, I don't know, 'cause I don't wanna, not to ruin anything, but I'm torn between believing that he's just this evil, kind of perverted guy, versus he's just really depressed and broken by dealing with what he's dealing with.

397
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:17,530
Speaker 0: Well, that's what the show's about, isn't it?

398
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:17,731
Speaker 1: Yeah.

399
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:24,770
Speaker 1: I mean, the whole show is just dealing with, say you have a person who is going to die, and everyone knows this fact, and there's no question about it.

400
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:29,830
Speaker 1: How do you, how do people deal with their friendships and their relationships with this person, knowing that they're gonna die?

401
00:28:30,493 --> 00:28:34,810
Speaker 1: And how does this person deal with their relationships with other people, knowing that they're not going to be around?

402
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:43,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is what I really don't get, is like, if I found out, let's say I found out right now I had super crazy disease Z, and I was gonna die in a week.

403
00:28:44,130 --> 00:28:48,090
Speaker 0: But, in the meantime, I mean, the girl who's sick can still walk around and do stuff.

404
00:28:48,170 --> 00:28:51,090
Speaker 0: She can't do it, she's kinda in the same situation as the hepatitis kid.

405
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:58,430
Speaker 0: She can't go running around town willy-nilly, but, you know, she can walk around the hospital and talk to people, and that kind of stuff, you know.

406
00:28:58,811 --> 00:29:05,970
Speaker 0: Maybe she's a little more restricted because of her crazy terminal illness, but it's not a catching plague or anything, so they don't have to lock her up in quarantine.

407
00:29:06,970 --> 00:29:16,130
Speaker 0: You know, so, if I had a disease kinda like that, I knew I was gonna die, but I'm not in really immediate pain, and I can kinda go around and do stuff.

408
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:21,850
Speaker 0: I would be doing crazy stuff before I die, and not sitting in a hospital, you know, going bleh.

409
00:29:22,191 --> 00:29:36,970
Speaker 1: I think the problem is that, from what I can gather, because they don't tell you much about what's going on, but I think it's some sort of congenital heart defect, or some sort of, something to do with the heart or possibly the lungs, and a large heart, it's really hard to tell.

410
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:42,850
Speaker 0: I think they're trying to be ambiguous on purpose, so that you can put any disease you want in there.

411
00:29:43,150 --> 00:29:44,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yet they're very realistic about it.

412
00:29:44,953 --> 00:29:53,650
Speaker 1: It's not like, you know, anime diseases, where the person's fine, except when they exert themselves for plot, and then they suddenly pass out magically.

413
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:57,830
Speaker 1: Like, the kid has hepatitis, and it makes sense, and it just works.

414
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,630
Speaker 0: I think it's actually a good choice to keep her illness sort of vague, because then the show becomes timeless.

415
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:08,630
Speaker 0: Like, if they said it was cancer, and then one day they had to cure for cancer, all of a sudden the show's kinda silly.

416
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:14,110
Speaker 0: But if they just say "disease," then you could put any disease in that spot, and the show will make sense.

417
00:30:14,550 --> 00:30:22,570
Speaker 1: But I think the reason she can't leave the hospital anymore is simply that, I mean, you can tell that she is very sick, and she really can't do anything.

418
00:30:23,133 --> 00:30:26,610
Speaker 1: And I think without the constant care of doctors, she would die in short order.

419
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:28,990
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I think that's pretty obvious.

420
00:30:29,110 --> 00:30:40,230
Speaker 0: But, uh, another reason she probably shouldn't leave the hospital is that, if she suddenly, like, is almost dying, then they might as well do the surgery that has, like, the 1.1% chance of success or whatever.

421
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:42,047
Speaker 0: They didn't actually say 1% in the show, but...

422
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:45,561
Speaker 1: It's not like Ava, with a, you know, "0 0 0 0 0.1% chance of success, blah blah

423
00:30:45,621 --> 00:30:45,782
Speaker 1: blah!".

424
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:51,249
Speaker 0: Or, like, Death Note, "I'm 5% sure you are Kira," you know?

425
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:59,470
Speaker 0: But it's like, if I had a surgery with a low chance of success, right, you wouldn't want to do it to me, you know, until the last possible minute.

426
00:31:00,796 --> 00:31:01,630
Speaker 0: It just makes sense.

427
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,250
Speaker 1: I could see it being where the longer you wait, the lower the chances are.

428
00:31:05,593 --> 00:31:06,470
Speaker 0: Oh, of course, of course.

429
00:31:07,032 --> 00:31:10,730
Speaker 1: They don't really talk about it a lot, but it's a really tricky situation.

430
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:16,270
Speaker 1: And there are a lot of characters, I mean, the girl's mother is involved, and you see her, like, in the background periodically.

431
00:31:17,233 --> 00:31:23,269
Speaker 1: And the show's very good at not telling you outright what's happening, but letting you find out.

432
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:29,150
Speaker 0: And each episode seems, it's actually episodic, like, each episode is about something different.

433
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:36,010
Speaker 0: And the general plot carries over, but each episode tends to be about something, you know?

434
00:31:36,770 --> 00:31:43,870
Speaker 0: So, you can watch one episode and get, like, the mini-story, and then all the six mini-stories tie together into the full story.

435
00:31:44,551 --> 00:31:52,730
Speaker 1: And the one thing I'd like to say is that the animation is very generic, and the show looks like your typical, you know, copy and paste random normal anime.

436
00:31:53,610 --> 00:32:02,030
Speaker 1: And the characters at first might look very stereotypical and one-dimensional, but they're actually fairly well-developed, especially considering how few episodes there are.

437
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:12,630
Speaker 1: I mean, every character, the nurse and everyone, they're very distinct, and they have a lot of, I guess, character elements that don't play a big role, but they play a big role in terms of fleshing the character out.

438
00:32:13,151 --> 00:32:24,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems like the personalities of the characters come out, and, you know, they don't develop so much, except for, like, the main characters, but they're exposed in a nice way.

439
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:26,614
Speaker 1: But not in a stupid way.

440
00:32:26,674 --> 00:32:32,190
Speaker 1: Like, the Doctor, there's a point at which, I mean, you really don't know what he's thinking, and no one just comes out and says what he's thinking.

441
00:32:32,691 --> 00:32:43,030
Speaker 1: And you have to make a lot of guesses based on the way he's acting, and at one point, the Doctor, you run into him, and he's just, he's drinking himself into a stupor and kinda going nuts in the middle of the night, all alone.

442
00:32:44,731 --> 00:32:45,453
Speaker 0: But, uh, yeah.

443
00:32:45,914 --> 00:32:52,170
Speaker 0: Another thing is, they don't have, the characters don't have a lot of, like, information-heavy history.

444
00:32:52,330 --> 00:33:07,590
Speaker 0: Like, you don't have to know that, like, this guy has two parents and a sister, and the sister was in a war, and the dad was this and the who and the... A lot of that stuff they just don't even talk about, so you don't have to, you know, it's only six episodes, they don't have space for that stuff.

445
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,409
Speaker 1: So the show's very focused on the here and the now.

446
00:33:09,750 --> 00:33:09,953
Speaker 0: Yep.

447
00:33:10,562 --> 00:33:11,049
Speaker 0: It's very good.

448
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:20,367
Speaker 0: So, I know that, uh, our friends who are listening have seen the movie Night on Galactic Railroad, and they're probably all right now going, "Ah!

449
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:20,447
Speaker 0: Ah!".

450
00:33:21,771 --> 00:33:26,610
Speaker 0: Well, if you've seen this movie, it's a really, really slow anime.

451
00:33:27,552 --> 00:33:30,750
Speaker 1: It's really good if you watch it at about 4x fast-forward.

452
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:31,391
Speaker 1: Yeah.

453
00:33:31,812 --> 00:33:39,610
Speaker 0: I mean, it has a good story, it's really meaningful, if you, you know, you might not like the actual message, but the way the message is presented is very good.

454
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the way I would describe it.

455
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:41,450
Speaker 1: Yeah.

456
00:33:42,172 --> 00:33:49,470
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, it has good, uh, it's just, it's like this... think of it as like the Polar Express, but for Japan.

457
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:53,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently it's based on a very well-known and very famous book.

458
00:33:54,110 --> 00:34:00,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, the book of this movie plays a role in one of the episodes of the Half Moon show.

459
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,990
Speaker 1: Now, we didn't realize it right away, because they translated the title of the book a bit differently.

460
00:34:04,350 --> 00:34:08,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, the DVD, the American DVD that I have, yes I have it, of Night on Galactic Railroad.

461
00:34:08,966 --> 00:34:10,150
Speaker 0: That's what it says on the DVD.

462
00:34:10,469 --> 00:34:20,429
Speaker 0: In the, in the, uh, anime here, the book the girl has says "Night on Milky Way Express" or something like that?

463
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:25,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's one of those, you know, fan-subbers will translate a sign in the background or some text on the screen.

464
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:28,690
Speaker 1: It's not up there fast enough to see it, and we were too lazy to rewind and look at it.

465
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:33,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not a, it's not the same translation, so it didn't catch on right away.

466
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:37,170
Speaker 0: I thought it might have been like "Galaxy Express 999" or something like that.

467
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:49,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then, and we didn't even think about it until the character, they start, actually there's this really neat, not really allegory, but the characters start referring to each other by the names from the story.

468
00:34:49,889 --> 00:34:50,161
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

469
00:34:50,771 --> 00:34:51,810
Speaker 1: Uh, Giovanni and, uh...

470
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:52,849
Speaker 0: Campanella.

471
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:53,529
Speaker 1: Campanella.

472
00:34:53,851 --> 00:35:07,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, and the thing is, if you've read this story or seen this other anime that's, you know, called Night on Galactic Railroad, that has parallels to this show that, you know, it's like "Oh, it means

473
00:35:07,289 --> 00:35:07,630
Speaker 0: something!".

474
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:13,230
Speaker 0: But even if you haven't seen it, they reveal what happens in the, in this other anime in this show, so you don't have to...

475
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:14,173
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much right away.

476
00:35:14,254 --> 00:35:18,950
Speaker 1: I mean, we noticed the connection, and we're, and it was kind of profound, and it really gave us pause.

477
00:35:19,731 --> 00:35:29,570
Speaker 1: And then five minutes later in the show, the character who didn't realize it yet figures it out on his own, and as a result, everyone in the audience now knows, whether you've read it or not.

478
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:36,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's basically, if you already know what they're talking about, then it hits you like five minutes earlier than it hits everyone else.

479
00:35:38,331 --> 00:35:42,170
Speaker 0: It's just a nice touch, I think, that they added reference to a real book, you know?

480
00:35:42,730 --> 00:35:46,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus the book actually fits really well with what's going on.

481
00:35:46,890 --> 00:35:48,196
Speaker 0: Oh, really well, I think that's the point.

482
00:35:48,256 --> 00:35:58,590
Speaker 0: Like, imagine if I wrote a story that was essentially Star Wars, and, but, it was all, I changed the whole setting and all the names of the characters and everything, but this guy was essentially Luke, and that guy was Darth Vader.

483
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:03,370
Speaker 0: And then I had a character reading, or like, watching Star Wars on DVD in the show.

484
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:10,410
Speaker 0: And then, they started referring to each other as, like, Luke and Darth, and that, and then that actually represented the story, because they were.

485
00:36:11,131 --> 00:36:12,068
Speaker 0: You know, that's what it'd be like.

486
00:36:12,853 --> 00:36:17,150
Speaker 1: Now, I guess in sum, I like this show a lot, and I have very high hopes for it.

487
00:36:17,951 --> 00:36:22,130
Speaker 1: My final opinion's going to weigh very heavily on how the show actually ends.

488
00:36:23,111 --> 00:36:28,686
Speaker 0: Once I found out that there were six episodes, my estimate for how good it's going to be, like, skyrocketed.

489
00:36:29,307 --> 00:36:30,230
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

490
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:36,550
Speaker 1: I mean, the show's very heartwarming, it's very, I think it's very real, and very profound.

491
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:43,790
Speaker 1: Not profound in a change-your-life way, but profound in a give pause and think about what would you do if you were in this kind of situation.

492
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:46,481
Speaker 0: I just told you that, like, five minutes ago.

493
00:36:47,185 --> 00:36:47,970
Speaker 0: I already figured it out.

494
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,854
Speaker 1: Well, everyone reacts to that differently.

495
00:36:49,895 --> 00:36:54,490
Speaker 1: I mean, some people, I mean, the girl in the show is obviously resigned to her fate, whatever it may be.

496
00:36:55,232 --> 00:36:58,369
Speaker 1: And it's more how the people around her are dealing with this.

497
00:36:59,851 --> 00:37:11,850
Speaker 0: All I gotta tell you, if I know you, and you're in the hospital, and you're going to die in, like, a week, and you're not, you know, and you have the ability to come outside and live it up, and you're not doing so, I'm only going to visit you, like, once, maybe.

498
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:15,435
Speaker 0: You know, and I'll say, "Hey, you should come live it up.

499
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:18,343
Speaker 0: Sorry to see you go," et cetera, et cetera.

500
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:19,606
Speaker 0: I'll go to your funeral, though.

501
00:37:20,287 --> 00:37:20,889
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

502
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:24,117
Speaker 1: Now, we've talked about a show that we really like.

503
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:28,910
Speaker 1: Now, we're going to talk about one of the worst shows we've seen recently.

504
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:30,529
Speaker 0: Oh, man, this show is bad.

505
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:35,690
Speaker 1: Now, we didn't like Kagehime, and we went into great detail as to why we didn't like Kagehime.

506
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,570
Speaker 0: If you don't remember, Kagehime was the key rape show.

507
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:45,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, the cute, happy, magical girl show where they rape each other horribly with keys, both physically and metaphorically.

508
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:47,650
Speaker 1: It's one of the worst things I've ever seen.

509
00:37:48,492 --> 00:37:50,289
Speaker 0: I've seen worse things, but it was real bad.

510
00:37:50,991 --> 00:37:54,490
Speaker 1: Now, this show is pretty much down there in terms of quality.

511
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,417
Speaker 0: Man, and the show was so tricky, too.

512
00:37:56,498 --> 00:37:57,885
Speaker 0: Like, you didn't know right away.

513
00:37:58,085 --> 00:37:59,010
Speaker 0: You had to watch a bit.

514
00:37:59,470 --> 00:38:00,573
Speaker 1: All right, so tactical roar.

515
00:38:00,974 --> 00:38:01,876
Speaker 1: The way it began is.

516
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:05,125
Speaker 1: it looked like it was going to be some sort of military thing.

517
00:38:05,225 --> 00:38:07,190
Speaker 1: It starts with heavy military action.

518
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:09,430
Speaker 0: It looked like it was going to be a light-hearted Gundam.

519
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:16,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, our friend Katsu was laying on the floor while we were watching it, and he was basically, like, naming all the fighter jets and all the guns.

520
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:23,290
Speaker 1: And the show, at least in terms of military hardware, was somewhat realistic and based in reality, just future reality.

521
00:38:24,272 --> 00:38:32,330
Speaker 0: It has appealed to military fanboys somewhat, especially if you also like, you know, girly anime-type action.

522
00:38:32,970 --> 00:38:34,253
Speaker 1: Now, all right, that's cool.

523
00:38:34,854 --> 00:38:37,941
Speaker 1: Then, after a few minutes, we realized something very important.

524
00:38:38,563 --> 00:38:41,770
Speaker 1: The entire cast and crew up to this point is female.

525
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,750
Speaker 0: Hence the girly anime-type action.

526
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:47,498
Speaker 1: Like, everyone, there is not a male to be seen.

527
00:38:47,618 --> 00:38:52,090
Speaker 1: There might have been one fat old, like, admiral somewhere, but other than that, it's all women.

528
00:38:52,491 --> 00:38:54,689
Speaker 1: All very young women with very large breasts.

529
00:38:55,210 --> 00:39:00,330
Speaker 0: Yep, every single crew member, and it's not just, like, a harem show with this one girl of each type.

530
00:39:00,810 --> 00:39:04,822
Speaker 0: It's, like, a whole harem, and then a whole mess of other generic girls.

531
00:39:05,023 --> 00:39:07,310
Speaker 0: Like, a giant crowd of them, literally.

532
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:11,250
Speaker 1: So, at this point, we've decided, all right, this show is crap, but whatever, let's keep watching.

533
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:12,800
Speaker 0: We watched it for about five more minutes.

534
00:39:12,921 --> 00:39:14,330
Speaker 0: You didn't watch the whole thing, did we?

535
00:39:14,713 --> 00:39:16,069
Speaker 1: We watched much of it.

536
00:39:16,310 --> 00:39:19,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we watched, like, 80% of the episode, and then fast-forwarded through the rest.

537
00:39:19,410 --> 00:39:20,995
Speaker 1: So, it doesn't go in the direction you'd think.

538
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:25,450
Speaker 1: They do introduce one male character, so it is essentially a harem show.

539
00:39:25,850 --> 00:39:42,190
Speaker 1: However, it's a yuri show, as far as we can tell, because, I mean, there's this one girl who appears, and she's, like, older-looking than all the rest, and they give you the impression that she has had sexual relations with every single other female character in this show.

540
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:51,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like a girl, you know, there's a normal sort of, like, woman, and she's talking to the guy character, and this girl comes up and is like, "Oh, why are you talking to

541
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:52,110
Speaker 0: him?".

542
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:56,886
Speaker 0: And then, like, a million start showing up, like, vying for her attention and stuff, and it's like,

543
00:39:57,187 --> 00:39:57,910
Speaker 0: "Okay.".

544
00:39:57,990 --> 00:40:02,290
Speaker 1: Then she appears later, covered in lipstick from various colors over various parts of her body.

545
00:40:02,758 --> 00:40:02,946
Speaker 0: Yeah.

546
00:40:03,873 --> 00:40:09,730
Speaker 1: And, again, I'll mention that every single non-male breast in this show is gigantic.

547
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:20,330
Speaker 0: It bounces, it's exposed, it's zoomed in, you got all the typical things falling on top of men, accidental extra cleavage, upskirt action.

548
00:40:20,771 --> 00:40:22,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically infinite sea of panty shots.

549
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:26,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the moe and yuri that you could ask for.

550
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:31,045
Speaker 1: This show, basically, I didn't see any redeeming qualities.

551
00:40:31,969 --> 00:40:32,330
Speaker 0: At all.

552
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:34,234
Speaker 0: I saw one redeeming quality in the show.

553
00:40:34,795 --> 00:40:43,050
Speaker 0: It's the only show that I've seen that combines military fanboy and perverted fanboy into one.

554
00:40:44,031 --> 00:40:45,250
Speaker 1: I'll bet there are shows out there.

555
00:40:45,350 --> 00:40:49,210
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are, but this is the only one that comes that I've ever seen at all.

556
00:40:49,730 --> 00:40:52,370
Speaker 1: I mean, at least Kagehime had a cute opener.

557
00:40:53,532 --> 00:40:54,470
Speaker 0: It did have a cute opener.

558
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:55,878
Speaker 1: This show has nothing.

559
00:40:55,999 --> 00:40:57,330
Speaker 1: This show is just horrible.

560
00:40:58,410 --> 00:41:00,169
Speaker 0: The animation had lots of bright colors.

561
00:41:01,052 --> 00:41:03,510
Speaker 1: That seems to be the hallmark of bad shows these days.

562
00:41:03,710 --> 00:41:05,398
Speaker 0: But the thing is, I like bright colors.

563
00:41:05,478 --> 00:41:07,930
Speaker 0: I wish that there would be good shows with bright colors.

564
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:10,610
Speaker 0: Razifon was a good show with bright colors.

565
00:41:10,970 --> 00:41:12,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, Utena was good, but that was definitely all pastels.

566
00:41:14,692 --> 00:41:15,522
Speaker 0: I'm talking more about the...

567
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:20,770
Speaker 1: Actually, Half Moon is very bright and well-defined.

568
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:21,633
Speaker 0: Part of it.

569
00:41:21,934 --> 00:41:24,710
Speaker 0: It's in the hospital, I think, so it keeps a lot of the colors down.

570
00:41:25,270 --> 00:41:27,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, but whenever they go outside, it really shines.

571
00:41:27,532 --> 00:41:27,836
Speaker 1: Yeah.

572
00:41:28,546 --> 00:41:28,870
Speaker 0: Hmm.

573
00:41:30,471 --> 00:41:32,830
Speaker 0: Anyone else can think of good shows with bright colors?

574
00:41:34,671 --> 00:41:42,210
Speaker 0: Eva sometimes has bright colors, but it seems to be very industrial, so it's not... You know, the penciling isn't the same bright happiness.

575
00:41:42,350 --> 00:41:44,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus Eva was done old school.

576
00:41:44,220 --> 00:41:45,949
Speaker 1: I mean, Eva's kinda old.

577
00:41:46,711 --> 00:41:46,954
Speaker 0: Yeah.

578
00:41:46,974 --> 00:41:48,430
Speaker 0: Azumanga Daioh has bright colors.

579
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:49,053
Speaker 0: Haha!

580
00:41:49,073 --> 00:41:51,150
Speaker 1: And Azumanga Daioh is one of my favorite shows ever.

581
00:41:51,371 --> 00:41:51,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

582
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,670
Speaker 1: Didn't even mention it in Favorites Week.

583
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:54,804
Speaker 0: No, no, we didn't.

584
00:41:56,231 --> 00:41:58,720
Speaker 0: We'll have to mention... Maybe it'll make manga week.

585
00:41:58,761 --> 00:42:00,025
Speaker 0: It's actually, I think the manga is...

586
00:42:01,612 --> 00:42:04,990
Speaker 1: I don't know, because in manga, it's competing with Yotsubato.

587
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:08,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think Yotsuba might win, but it's the same thing by the same guy.

588
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:14,610
Speaker 0: As far as I'm concerned, Yotsuba 1 is like Azumanga Daioh 5.

589
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,326
Speaker 0: Only, yeah, I think Yotsuba's better.

590
00:42:16,407 --> 00:42:16,750
Speaker 0: Whatever.

591
00:42:18,134 --> 00:42:18,569
Speaker 0: It's all good.

592
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:19,682
Speaker 1: So in sum...

593
00:42:20,810 --> 00:42:23,890
Speaker 0: This anime was so bad, we couldn't even talk about it anymore.

594
00:42:24,231 --> 00:42:26,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we stopped watching it.

595
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,070
Speaker 1: We watched Kagehime Episode 1 all the way through.

596
00:42:29,510 --> 00:42:34,790
Speaker 1: In fact, we watched it a couple times because we showed it to other people who didn't believe us when we told them what was in it.

597
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:38,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had to demonstrate what key rape was to them.

598
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:45,528
Speaker 1: 'Cause they... I remember Pete was sitting there saying, "Alright, you guys are obviously... This is gonna be like that naked car thing, and it's actually something

599
00:42:45,649 --> 00:42:45,810
Speaker 1: else.".

600
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:46,673
Speaker 1: Now...

601
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:49,529
Speaker 0: Naked car is actually naked car, so I don't know what he's talking about.

602
00:42:52,511 --> 00:42:56,510
Speaker 1: But anyway, Half Moon is a very good show, and it's only six episodes.

603
00:42:56,970 --> 00:42:59,162
Speaker 1: I highly recommend all of you out there.

604
00:42:59,202 --> 00:42:59,584
Speaker 1: watch it.

605
00:42:59,665 --> 00:43:00,650
Speaker 1: It's well worth seeing.

606
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:03,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a torrent right now to get all six episodes at once.

607
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:09,770
Speaker 0: I'm getting it because we don't have the sixth episode, and I can't get the sixth episode on its own, so I'm getting this one through six torrent.

608
00:43:09,970 --> 00:43:11,195
Speaker 1: I mean, don't drop anything.

609
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:14,370
Speaker 1: If you're in the middle of watching Cowboy Bebop, don't drop that to watch the show.

610
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:16,830
Speaker 1: But if you want anime... Hold on to the show and watch it someday.

611
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:18,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want anime to watch, watch this.

612
00:43:19,093 --> 00:43:21,750
Speaker 0: And I'm sure someday this whole thing will be released on a single DVD.

613
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could definitely say that'll happen.

614
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,841
Speaker 0: Probably be like a $25 DVD.

615
00:43:26,365 --> 00:43:26,950
Speaker 0: Six episodes.

616
00:43:27,350 --> 00:43:31,850
Speaker 1: And of course, we're gonna talk about it one more time after we see how it ends in one of our final thoughts episodes.

617
00:43:32,290 --> 00:43:32,365
Speaker 1: Yep.

618
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:44,450
Speaker 1: Which we try to do few and far between, because we know that once we start talking about a show in that regard, you really can't listen to Geek Nights anymore, at least for that episode, because we'll just be spoiling the hell out of the show if you haven't seen it.

619
00:43:44,590 --> 00:43:47,769
Speaker 0: Well, you can listen to the news and the thing of the day and then turn Geek Nights off or...

620
00:43:48,010 --> 00:43:52,030
Speaker 1: The one thing about Geek Nights, we will always warn well ahead of time if we're gonna spoil things.

621
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:53,870
Speaker 1: Like, repeatedly and loudly.

622
00:43:55,251 --> 00:43:57,870
Speaker 0: You know what happens at the end of, uh... Blah blah blah blah?

623
00:43:58,556 --> 00:43:59,410
Speaker 1: Uh, blah blah blah blah blah.

624
00:43:59,672 --> 00:44:00,269
Speaker 0: Everyone dies.

625
00:44:03,252 --> 00:44:06,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, so at the end of, uh, Tactical Roar, I assume everyone dies.

626
00:44:07,656 --> 00:44:07,928
Speaker 0: Really?

627
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:10,369
Speaker 1: Uh, that, that, fuck, that, that freakin' show.

628
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:18,669
Speaker 0: You know what, in Tactical Roar, that guy comes very, very close to fulfilling his multi-woman, lesbian, multi-way fantasy.

629
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:19,928
Speaker 1: No, because they're all lesbians!

630
00:44:20,350 --> 00:44:21,629
Speaker 0: But he never quite makes it all the way.

631
00:44:23,112 --> 00:44:23,978
Speaker 0: That's what the show's about.

632
00:44:24,018 --> 00:44:25,429
Speaker 0: It's just about teasing to the edge.

633
00:44:26,130 --> 00:44:31,785
Speaker 1: See, now normally if a show's bad, like Kagehime, we said, "Hey, watch it, because this is so bad it's hilarious.

634
00:44:32,208 --> 00:44:32,309
Speaker 1: And

635
00:44:32,349 --> 00:44:32,530
Speaker 1: horrible.".

636
00:44:33,211 --> 00:44:34,770
Speaker 1: Don't even bother watching Tactical Roar.

637
00:44:35,151 --> 00:44:37,170
Speaker 1: It's so bad, it's not even funny bad.

638
00:44:37,290 --> 00:44:38,925
Speaker 1: Like, you won't sit there going, "Haha, this is

639
00:44:38,965 --> 00:44:39,429
Speaker 1: terrible.".

640
00:44:39,753 --> 00:44:41,270
Speaker 1: You'll just sit there in disgust.

641
00:44:42,131 --> 00:44:45,910
Speaker 0: Unless, of course, you really, really, really like military fanboyism.

642
00:44:46,914 --> 00:44:51,010
Speaker 0: Or, unless you really, really, really like up skirts and panty shots.

643
00:44:51,230 --> 00:44:55,930
Speaker 1: If any of you out there actually like Tactical Roar, we have to have some words.

644
00:44:56,790 --> 00:45:04,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, is there anyone out there who actually likes, like, T&A, like, sort of porny but not hentai anime?

645
00:45:04,610 --> 00:45:07,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're not talking, like, Ghost in the Shell or anything like that.

646
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:09,590
Speaker 0: We're talking like-- Yeah, where the girls happen to be hot.

647
00:45:09,750 --> 00:45:13,270
Speaker 1: Like magical booby fighter ex-something.

648
00:45:13,511 --> 00:45:17,930
Speaker 0: We're talking, like, Burn Up with the, uh, or what's the other show?

649
00:45:18,771 --> 00:45:19,389
Speaker 0: Dirty Pear.

650
00:45:20,732 --> 00:45:24,010
Speaker 0: If you like Dirty Pear, tell us why in our forum.

651
00:45:24,230 --> 00:45:25,370
Speaker 1: Dirty Pear's not that bad.

652
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,970
Speaker 0: It's not, there's actually some show in Dirty Pear, but there's also the Jiggle Meter.

653
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:31,337
Speaker 1: Alright, you know what?

654
00:45:31,621 --> 00:45:32,369
Speaker 1: Tactical Roar.

655
00:45:32,710 --> 00:45:36,549
Speaker 1: If you like Tactical Roar, I think we can unabashedly say we probably hate you.

656
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:37,588
Speaker 0: Yep, could be.

657
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:48,100
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

658
00:45:48,382 --> 00:45:50,719
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for our opening theme.

665

Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded with absolutely no studio and no audience.

Speaker 0: But unlike those other talk shows, it's actually recorded at night.
