1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,220
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, February 16th, 2016.

2
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:16,129
Speaker 0: I'm Rym, and this is Geek Nights Tonight.

3
00:00:18,735 --> 00:00:19,241
Speaker 1: Helldivers.

4
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:19,889
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,940 --> 00:00:27,880
Speaker 0: So we mentioned a bunch of times that we've been playing a giant multiplayer robot game of Civ 5.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,699
Speaker 0: We're what, like 70 turns in now?

7
00:00:30,021 --> 00:00:32,400
Speaker 1: I don't know how many turns it is, but I need some fucking money.

8
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:37,219
Speaker 1: My caravan was doing great, and then a barbarian just went

9
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:37,320
Speaker 1: "boop!".

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,444
Speaker 0: You gotta protect that shit.

11
00:00:38,464 --> 00:00:41,618
Speaker 0: You've got caravans going off into unprotected barbarian lands.

12
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,008
Speaker 1: It was not unprotected barbarian lands.

13
00:00:44,089 --> 00:00:47,691
Speaker 1: It was lands that I presumed were perfectly safe, and then a barbarian just went

14
00:00:47,711 --> 00:00:47,893
Speaker 1: "whoop!".

15
00:00:48,075 --> 00:00:48,479
Speaker 0: Here I am.

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,700
Speaker 0: I got scouts patrolling my trade routes to make sure barbarians don't get out of there.

17
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:54,499
Speaker 1: I don't have enough shit for that.

18
00:00:54,781 --> 00:00:58,260
Speaker 1: Also, I don't necessarily trust- Because there's so many fucking barbarians in the way.

19
00:00:59,022 --> 00:01:03,240
Speaker 1: All my guys were on the barbarians behind my territory, but my caravan went in the other direction.

20
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:04,540
Speaker 0: Well, that's your problem.

21
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:08,279
Speaker 1: But the city that I was sending it to was right there.

22
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:09,340
Speaker 0: Send it to a different city!

23
00:01:10,181 --> 00:01:13,100
Speaker 1: There was no other city to send it to because there's no one fucking near me.

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,460
Speaker 0: Then send it to your own city and you get a huge boost instead of money.

25
00:01:16,821 --> 00:01:16,981
Speaker 1: It was.

26
00:01:17,021 --> 00:01:21,800
Speaker 1: I needed more monies than that to make up for my debts because I built so many good buildings at high maintenance.

27
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:22,691
Speaker 0: I thought you built too much shit.

28
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:23,298
Speaker 0: You know what you should do?

29
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,339
Speaker 1: But I had good shit!

30
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:25,763
Speaker 0: Good shit!

31
00:01:26,024 --> 00:01:30,540
Speaker 0: If you can send a guy near me, I will gladly pay you money for a luxury resource.

32
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,070
Speaker 1: I'm on a worthless island.

33
00:01:32,171 --> 00:01:33,379
Speaker 1: Am I gonna send a guy to you?

34
00:01:34,480 --> 00:01:35,459
Speaker 0: Completely on an island?

35
00:01:37,685 --> 00:01:39,180
Speaker 0: Is there shallows they get across?

36
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:42,676
Speaker 0: Is your science so pathetic that you can't go into the shallows yet?

37
00:01:42,716 --> 00:01:43,260
Speaker 0: Can you embark?

38
00:01:44,602 --> 00:01:48,360
Speaker 1: I would need to build something.

39
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:48,966
Speaker 0: Just a scout!

40
00:01:48,987 --> 00:01:49,799
Speaker 0: Just send a scout down.

41
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:55,620
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, by the time I build the thing, you know, what's gonna happen to my monies?

42
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:57,419
Speaker 1: My coffers are gonna be empty.

43
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:59,159
Speaker 0: Well, don't you trade with Lisa.

44
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:02,700
Speaker 1: She's on the other side of the barbarians.

45
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,160
Speaker 0: Do you have diplomatic relations?

46
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:06,478
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,900
Speaker 0: You never bumped into her so you can see her in the diplomatic thing?

48
00:02:10,401 --> 00:02:13,000
Speaker 1: Uh, maybe I can, but she's not gonna just give me fucking money.

49
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,184
Speaker 0: Well, trade her something.

50
00:02:14,225 --> 00:02:15,690
Speaker 0: That's how diplomacy works.

51
00:02:15,791 --> 00:02:17,197
Speaker 0: Like, "Yo, I'll give you this

52
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:17,357
Speaker 0: city.".

53
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,718
Speaker 1: I'm gonna trade with someone who's like right there.

54
00:02:20,244 --> 00:02:20,638
Speaker 0: Why not?

55
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,951
Speaker 1: Who's like the most powerful person in the game?

56
00:02:22,992 --> 00:02:24,340
Speaker 1: and I'm like the last most powerful.

57
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,440
Speaker 0: If you're the last most powerful, you should ally with the first most powerful for a little while to suck resources out of her.

58
00:02:30,343 --> 00:02:31,059
Speaker 1: Why would she do that?

59
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,608
Speaker 0: 'Cause she'll treat you like a toady.

60
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:34,740
Speaker 0: Or she'll give you, she's probably gonna, you know what, also.

61
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,570
Speaker 1: Then how come, how does she have money?

62
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:37,274
Speaker 1: That's not interesting.

63
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:38,140
Speaker 1: You're in the same situation.

64
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,980
Speaker 0: I got a shit ton of money.

65
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:41,159
Speaker 1: How did you get all the money from?

66
00:02:41,962 --> 00:02:44,359
Speaker 0: I got spices all over, up ends.

67
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:46,080
Speaker 1: How did you get, how did you turn them into money?

68
00:02:46,761 --> 00:02:49,394
Speaker 0: Uh, spices, if you work them, give you like three gold.

69
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:50,680
Speaker 0: Just on the land.

70
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:55,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have some spaces like that, but it still doesn't add up to as much money as it costs me every turn.

71
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,379
Speaker 1: How many militaries do you have?

72
00:02:57,003 --> 00:02:57,995
Speaker 0: Uh, pretty large military, actually.

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had to disband a military 'cause I couldn't afford it.

74
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:06,120
Speaker 0: I may have a trade agreement where I'm giving someone a luxury resource in return for like seven gold a turn.

75
00:03:06,884 --> 00:03:07,920
Speaker 1: Oh, well that matters a lot.

76
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:08,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, so.

77
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,180
Speaker 1: But I'm not near anyone to make a trade agreement.

78
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,480
Speaker 0: In fact, I'm gonna build my fourth city real soon, I think.

79
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,670
Speaker 1: I don't even have a third city 'cause I can't make a settler.

80
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,700
Speaker 1: 'cause I'm too busy trying to build a replacement caravan.

81
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:22,600
Speaker 0: Uh, sounds like civilization, tell you what, Scott, if you reach me and make diplomatic relations.

82
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:28,240
Speaker 1: I wanna see like exactly what you had each city building each turn that allowed you to be more productive.

83
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:33,580
Speaker 0: I'll tell you what, one thing that I did different, probably, is that I placed my cities real well.

84
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:34,879
Speaker 1: I placed my cities real well.

85
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:39,100
Speaker 0: And I rushed culture so I could max out liberty.

86
00:03:40,382 --> 00:03:42,320
Speaker 1: I mean, I got as much culture as I could.

87
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, you traditioned.

88
00:03:45,003 --> 00:03:45,680
Speaker 0: Tradition sucks.

89
00:03:47,588 --> 00:03:47,778
Speaker 1: Alright.

90
00:03:48,183 --> 00:03:48,740
Speaker 0: That's part of it.

91
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,279
Speaker 0: What did you get?

92
00:03:49,924 --> 00:03:50,660
Speaker 0: Liberty, all liberty.

93
00:03:51,283 --> 00:03:52,140
Speaker 1: I also got liberty.

94
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,500
Speaker 0: In fact, I'm almost done with liberty.

95
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:55,319
Speaker 1: I only have like one liberty.

96
00:03:55,582 --> 00:03:55,804
Speaker 0: What?

97
00:03:55,884 --> 00:03:57,860
Speaker 0: Did you build like monuments or amphitheaters?

98
00:03:58,801 --> 00:04:02,080
Speaker 1: I built, I can't build an amphitheater yet, I built monuments.

99
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,700
Speaker 0: In every city as soon as you started the city?

100
00:04:05,525 --> 00:04:05,937
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

101
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:06,689
Speaker 0: Alright.

102
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,680
Speaker 0: So you built a monument, every city you founded, the first thing you built was a monument.

103
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,458
Speaker 1: Yes, all two of them.

104
00:04:12,302 --> 00:04:13,800
Speaker 0: And you built a monument both immediately.

105
00:04:14,181 --> 00:04:14,266
Speaker 1: Yeah.

106
00:04:16,063 --> 00:04:20,860
Speaker 0: And, well liberty gives you, makes monuments give you more liberty, or give you more culture among other things.

107
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:25,100
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I spent all my time fighting barbaros.

108
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:26,519
Speaker 1: How many barbaros did you have to fight?

109
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:29,279
Speaker 0: Uh, I've destroyed like nine encampments.

110
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,300
Speaker 1: I've only seen like three encampments.

111
00:04:31,421 --> 00:04:32,860
Speaker 1: If I could, I actually have a military now.

112
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,480
Speaker 1: If another encampment appeared, I could kill it and get money.

113
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:38,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, encampments keep spawning because there's this, me and Alex have this truce.

114
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,440
Speaker 0: So there's an area between us where there's no settlements.

115
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,920
Speaker 1: There is no encampments spawning.

116
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:44,420
Speaker 0: And the problem is fucking barbarians keep spawning in this area.

117
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:47,680
Speaker 1: I kill, I invested in this military to kill barbarians.

118
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,960
Speaker 1: I killed them all and no new ones are showing up except for the one that popped out of nowhere to kill my caravan.

119
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,060
Speaker 0: So take over like a city-state or the rest of the area.

120
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:54,617
Speaker 0: Just conquer it?

121
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, just fucking go.

122
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,760
Speaker 1: But that's gonna hurt me if I conquer it.

123
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,080
Speaker 1: It's gonna bring me all kinds of unhappiness and troubles.

124
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,578
Speaker 0: Not that much.

125
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:04,520
Speaker 0: Plus, puppeted cities give you their science and their production and everything.

126
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,300
Speaker 1: Aren't they gonna cost me a whole bunch?

127
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:09,199
Speaker 1: Every time I conquer something when I play Civ, it just hurts me.

128
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,660
Speaker 0: It's always good for you unless you really overstep yourself.

129
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:15,357
Speaker 1: Every time in the history of Civ I've conquered something, it's been like, "Oh, you conquered

130
00:05:15,377 --> 00:05:15,659
Speaker 1: something.".

131
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:22,140
Speaker 1: Alright, yeah, now there's a bunch of people who hate you and your happiness is negative ten and it costs you a million dollars to maintain their shit and they suck.

132
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that goes down rapidly and then after a few turns it's making money again.

133
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,459
Speaker 1: I've never had that happen.

134
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,760
Speaker 0: Also, puppet them and they don't increase the cost of the next social policy.

135
00:05:32,983 --> 00:05:33,840
Speaker 1: Never had this happen.

136
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:38,980
Speaker 0: The social policies only get more expensive if you found or take cities and make them legit cities.

137
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:41,956
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll just give all my stuff to Lisa so she wins and be a troll.

138
00:05:42,117 --> 00:05:42,640
Speaker 1: if I can't win.

139
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,476
Speaker 0: Why don't you give it to me?

140
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:45,074
Speaker 1: Because you're on the other side of the map.

141
00:05:45,155 --> 00:05:45,459
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

142
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,498
Speaker 0: Why don't you give it to Scott Johnson?

143
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,399
Speaker 1: Also, if it's a vote who wins game, I'm not voting for you.

144
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:49,448
Speaker 0: Why not vote for me?

145
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:50,500
Speaker 0: Because right now Lisa's winning.

146
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:51,544
Speaker 1: Uh, okay.

147
00:05:52,008 --> 00:05:52,371
Speaker 1: She can win.

148
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:53,460
Speaker 1: It'll be done even faster.

149
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:56,286
Speaker 0: The thing is, you being done doesn't matter.

150
00:05:56,306 --> 00:06:00,240
Speaker 0: Why don't you just give each of your cities to a different person?

151
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,480
Speaker 1: My lands are real valuable.

152
00:06:01,801 --> 00:06:02,278
Speaker 0: No, they're not.

153
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:02,879
Speaker 1: They are.

154
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:04,240
Speaker 0: Apparently they don't make any money.

155
00:06:05,101 --> 00:06:06,928
Speaker 1: I have mad sugars and shit.

156
00:06:06,948 --> 00:06:08,935
Speaker 1: It just doesn't make enough money for some reason.

157
00:06:08,955 --> 00:06:10,480
Speaker 1: I don't know where you got those extra monies from.

158
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,520
Speaker 0: So, Scott, how many buildings are in your capital?

159
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,767
Speaker 1: Buildings?

160
00:06:13,807 --> 00:06:14,419
Speaker 1: I don't even know.

161
00:06:15,483 --> 00:06:15,866
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

162
00:06:15,887 --> 00:06:17,499
Speaker 0: Because I have like two buildings.

163
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:20,039
Speaker 1: I have way more than two buildings.

164
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, buildings cost a lot of money to maintain.

165
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:24,799
Speaker 1: I got a library and all kinds of good stuff.

166
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,460
Speaker 1: I had to get rid of my, I built a religious building just to get the pantheon, but then I had to sell it off to get the monies back, you know.

167
00:06:30,881 --> 00:06:32,088
Speaker 0: Ah, I've never sold a building.

168
00:06:32,129 --> 00:06:33,919
Speaker 0: Selling a building is like, you've already lost.

169
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:35,519
Speaker 1: I had no monies.

170
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:36,649
Speaker 0: How'd you run out of money?

171
00:06:37,175 --> 00:06:37,479
Speaker 1: Did you?

172
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,660
Speaker 1: Because I had a caravan to keep my coffers in the plus, and then the caravan got killed and it became minus.

173
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:44,886
Speaker 0: How much minus?

174
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,960
Speaker 0: It still used to have like 80 or 90 gold back up just hanging out.

175
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:54,500
Speaker 1: I killed a barbarian camp and that gave me enough money, but then after five turns that money was gone because it was negative every single turn.

176
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,480
Speaker 0: Alright, did you build- It was like negative five.

177
00:06:56,640 --> 00:07:00,514
Speaker 0: Did you build a whole bunch of like roads and improvements and shit everywhere?

178
00:07:00,534 --> 00:07:02,280
Speaker 0: Because each one of those costs a gold to maintain.

179
00:07:02,681 --> 00:07:03,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a whole bunch of them.

180
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,279
Speaker 0: Do you have more than you're using?

181
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:06,506
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

182
00:07:06,546 --> 00:07:07,640
Speaker 1: I'm using every single one.

183
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:09,620
Speaker 0: You're literally using every one of those improvements.

184
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:10,011
Speaker 1: Yup.

185
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,044
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

186
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,003
Speaker 1: Like a mad population.

187
00:07:13,043 --> 00:07:13,845
Speaker 1: I'm using every improvement.

188
00:07:13,865 --> 00:07:19,880
Speaker 1: In fact, I'm building an improvement so I can use it because I've got more alive populations on unimproved hexes.

189
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,320
Speaker 0: Uh, did you rejigger your cities to produce gold instead of production?

190
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:32,419
Speaker 0: Yes, they've been producing maximum gold since they've been, you know- I, if you log into your game and let me look at your cities, I will consult for you.

191
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,113
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm going to quit the game anyways.

192
00:07:35,133 --> 00:07:35,800
Speaker 1: It probably doesn't matter.

193
00:07:36,803 --> 00:07:38,006
Speaker 0: I can show you what you did right now.

194
00:07:38,046 --> 00:07:38,969
Speaker 0: I'll show you my cities.

195
00:07:38,989 --> 00:07:42,960
Speaker 0: Except I don't want to show you where my military is because I might be doing something with it soon.

196
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,640
Speaker 1: You're going to attack me across the water?

197
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:47,360
Speaker 0: No, I'm not attacking you, but I still like keep my secrets close.

198
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,657
Speaker 0: Someone's fucked in the nearing like 10 or 20 turns.

199
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:53,473
Speaker 1: Well, people near rim.

200
00:07:53,534 --> 00:07:53,980
Speaker 1: Go watch out.

201
00:07:53,980 --> 00:08:02,200
Speaker 0: So anyway, in the news, Street Fighter 5 came out and it's shocking how little I cared after I realized that it was out.

202
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,164
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I saw it.

203
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,894
Speaker 1: It packs a few times and I'm like, oh, it's more Street Fighter.

204
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:07,260
Speaker 1: I play Street Fighter 4 a bunch.

205
00:08:07,661 --> 00:08:10,000
Speaker 1: That'll hold me over to like Street Fighter 6 or something.

206
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:13,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I just- Seven, maybe seven will be a probably exciting one.

207
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,267
Speaker 0: I enjoy fighting games.

208
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,720
Speaker 0: I even have like a Mad Catz, like awesome fighting stick.

209
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:20,870
Speaker 0: I just, I don't have time for that anymore in my old age.

210
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,680
Speaker 0: Like I don't play Street Fighter-ish games enough to be good at them.

211
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:28,651
Speaker 0: And the only fighting games I'm good at that exist still are like Soul Calibur style.

212
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:38,515
Speaker 1: So- I don't want to play those other high skill cap games.

213
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:43,659
Speaker 1: We want to play low skill cap RTSs in fighting games and high skill cap RTSs in fighting games.

214
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:51,480
Speaker 0: Which is interesting because remember most people who are very good at very high skill cap games specialize in those games and do not play many other games.

215
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,945
Speaker 0: Which is true for us too in that realm.

216
00:08:54,426 --> 00:09:05,380
Speaker 0: But it's like in Omegathon, if there was both an RTS and DDR in the same Omegathon, the Venn diagram of people who are very skilled at both is probably close to zero.

217
00:09:06,288 --> 00:09:06,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably.

218
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:11,633
Speaker 0: But there's a problem with Street Fighter 5 and it seems weird.

219
00:09:11,673 --> 00:09:13,640
Speaker 0: I didn't dig into this too deeply.

220
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:15,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, this sounds suspicious.

221
00:09:15,146 --> 00:09:16,210
Speaker 1: I think it's overblown.

222
00:09:16,311 --> 00:09:18,440
Speaker 1: Whatever you're saying is probably inaccurate in many ways.

223
00:09:18,961 --> 00:09:19,443
Speaker 0: Not really.

224
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:23,254
Speaker 0: Because we ran into this and we complained about it in a previous Tuesday show.

225
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:31,220
Speaker 0: Where we were at a party and there were two PS4s in two different rooms at the party and a bunch of controllers.

226
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:39,399
Speaker 0: And every time we wanted to play like Towerfall or something, you had to fucking sit there and log every controller in as a guest one by one.

227
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:47,825
Speaker 0: And if someone was logged in with a game and they played the game and then they started playing a game on a different PS4, it would just kick the game out and crash it.

228
00:09:48,427 --> 00:09:54,080
Speaker 0: All these weird problems because it sort of assumes that everyone just has their own controller all the time forever.

229
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,840
Speaker 0: And I guess brings the controller with them and always has an account and logs in even for local throwaway multiplayer.

230
00:10:00,301 --> 00:10:05,860
Speaker 0: But, all that aside, that was a problem that existed, we were annoyed by, but it wasn't a deal breaker.

231
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,101
Speaker 0: That seems to be what's causing the first of the controller problems with Street Fighter 5.

232
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:16,339
Speaker 0: Because apparently you need a modern controller or it won't work.

233
00:10:17,423 --> 00:10:20,300
Speaker 1: Is that to prevent cheating because people like making their own controllers?

234
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:26,620
Speaker 0: It appears that if you have a controller, which I checked, it looks like my fighting stick would not work.

235
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:36,440
Speaker 0: And you want to use it in the PS4, you have to log in with the DualShock 4 controller shit, which isn't in the old fight sticks.

236
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:44,760
Speaker 0: So to make that controller work, you have to go through all these menus and go to legacy controller authentication.

237
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:56,160
Speaker 0: And then you have to set up your legacy controller and then you have to plug in a regular controller, like a regular DualShock 4, Playstation, whatever controller.

238
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:59,240
Speaker 0: And use that to log in and all this nonsense.

239
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:01,177
Speaker 1: So just play on Xbone or PC?

240
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:07,040
Speaker 0: So if you play on an Xbone, I believe it's fine because Xbox doesn't have as much of this nonsense.

241
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,340
Speaker 1: Well I guess they're not using the controller for the nonsense, right?

242
00:11:11,121 --> 00:11:15,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you're on the PC, it's also a problem.

243
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:15,638
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

244
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:25,390
Speaker 0: So quote, "As for PC, Street Fighter 5 natively supports a number of devices, but those without X input functionality will not work until a promised future

245
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:25,610
Speaker 0: patch.".

246
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:26,652
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

247
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:35,190
Speaker 1: So they pretty much only coded in support for certain controllers and they didn't support, you know, they only basically worked with the X input API for DirectX.

248
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:42,390
Speaker 1: So if your controller is like using the old, I mean that's almost any controller you're going to use is going to use X input, right?

249
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:54,750
Speaker 1: You'd have to get like some old busted like, you know, Thrustmaster flight stick thing, you know, that uses like the windows, like set up your analog controller thing to not work with that.

250
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:57,380
Speaker 1: That's not a real issue.

251
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,590
Speaker 1: No one's using a non-X input controller.

252
00:11:58,630 --> 00:12:07,290
Speaker 0: So from what I can gather, more people are than you'd think because a lot of people have custom or old fighting sticks that are super awesome that might have art or whatever on them.

253
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:09,110
Speaker 0: And those don't work anymore.

254
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,689
Speaker 1: I mean, it had to be a pretty old fight because they are...

255
00:12:11,912 --> 00:12:13,450
Speaker 0: It was widespread enough of a problem.

256
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:16,100
Speaker 1: The fighting stick we have is an Xbox 360 controller.

257
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:16,983
Speaker 1: It's using X input.

258
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,550
Speaker 1: So it has to be even older than that.

259
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:28,410
Speaker 0: And I'm saying that while I agree with you, there's enough people bitching on the internet that I guess there must be a community of people who have older controllers that don't do this.

260
00:12:28,410 --> 00:12:35,869
Speaker 1: I guess if you made your own controller, right, and you got the circuit board in your controller, it was not just an Xbox 360 controller that you opened up.

261
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:42,990
Speaker 0: Well, like, so me and Scott back in the day, when we played Dance Dance Revolution, we'd buy these bootleg like dance mats.

262
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:45,730
Speaker 0: And when they finally died, it was always because the dance mats...

263
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,150
Speaker 1: Those are just PlayStation controllers.

264
00:12:47,491 --> 00:12:48,693
Speaker 0: Yeah, the dance mat was shitty.

265
00:12:49,134 --> 00:12:57,170
Speaker 0: So when I made a hard DDR pad, I just took the circuit board out of the front of one of those things and wired it up to my hard pad.

266
00:12:57,611 --> 00:12:58,790
Speaker 1: Which is PS1 controller.

267
00:12:59,030 --> 00:12:59,970
Speaker 0: And it totally worked.

268
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:00,478
Speaker 1: Of course.

269
00:13:00,499 --> 00:13:00,687
Speaker 1: Why not?

270
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:02,212
Speaker 0: Yeah.

271
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:03,355
Speaker 0: So, yeah, people are complaining about this.

272
00:13:03,395 --> 00:13:09,390
Speaker 0: So apparently there's a workaround, but the workaround adds so much input lag that you can't actually play Street Fighter.

273
00:13:10,290 --> 00:13:12,207
Speaker 0: Some people were saying use joy to key and...

274
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:13,133
Speaker 1: Fuck you, joy to key.

275
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:18,927
Speaker 0: Joy to key is like the last ditch effort of Mad Men.

276
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:25,050
Speaker 0: Like, that is, like, joy to key is one step before sniffing cocaine out of a gutter.

277
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,478
Speaker 1: I never use joy to key.

278
00:13:26,558 --> 00:13:27,122
Speaker 1: I never will.

279
00:13:27,162 --> 00:13:27,948
Speaker 1: Anyone who uses it...

280
00:13:28,290 --> 00:13:31,970
Speaker 0: If the solution to your problem is joy to key, your problem is not worth solving.

281
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:32,510
Speaker 0: That's right.

282
00:13:32,670 --> 00:13:34,910
Speaker 0: And the game was badly written, binding of Isaac.

283
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:37,429
Speaker 1: I've played a lot of games that I've never needed to use joy to key.

284
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,550
Speaker 0: I've played a lot of games that would have needed it, and I decided just to not use a controller.

285
00:13:42,395 --> 00:13:42,519
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

286
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:43,849
Speaker 1: Just use the key.

287
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:44,386
Speaker 0: Yeah.

288
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,609
Speaker 0: Does he got any news?

289
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:48,790
Speaker 1: It's only... I couldn't find a lot of gaming news, so I found this tiny news.

290
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:50,478
Speaker 1: So today there's a big Steam sale.

291
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:52,650
Speaker 1: It's not really a big Steam sale like all of Steam.

292
00:13:53,290 --> 00:14:01,090
Speaker 1: It's a Steam sale on this one bundle of games, the Make War Not Love 3 prize one no cost from Sega.

293
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:07,090
Speaker 1: So you get, for zero dollars, Golden Axe, the original, the good one.

Speaker 0: Whoa!

295
00:14:08,255 --> 00:14:10,650
Speaker 0: It's not a great game, but I'd play it for zero dollars.

296
00:14:10,751 --> 00:14:14,270
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's a game you can just emulate, but it's three dollars, Golden Axe.

297
00:14:14,570 --> 00:14:14,663

00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:44,690
Speaker 1: But the question is why this Make War Not Love prize bundle one number three thing?

307
00:14:44,710 --> 00:14:46,129
Speaker 0: So do you know why, or are you asking?

308
00:14:48,030 --> 00:14:55,030
Speaker 1: Everyone's presuming that Sega is doing this for some sort of promotion of something coming soon that we're not sure of.

309
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:59,886
Speaker 1: So, like, there's going to be some sort of something from Sega coming soon.

310
00:15:00,248 --> 00:15:00,930
Speaker 1: that will be hot.

311
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:01,714
Speaker 0: Sounds about right.

312
00:15:01,754 --> 00:15:09,029
Speaker 0: I mean, like, if I was going to make a modern Rampart, I would definitely re-release the old Rampart for free on PCs.

313
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,848
Speaker 0: So I got one tiny news, too.

314
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,110
Speaker 0: Because, as you know, full disclosure, I'm associated with Date Naito.

315
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,990
Speaker 0: They make visual novels, so, you know, ethics in game journalism or whatever.

316
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:24,570
Speaker 0: But one of our games, We Know the Devil is a pretty cool game.

317
00:15:25,411 --> 00:15:31,470
Speaker 0: And one of the shiks is that it was going to be for sale for six dollars and sixty-six cents.

318
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,668
Speaker 1: Haha, Satan.

319
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:38,510
Speaker 0: And because of reasons, this was literally impossible to do on Steam.

320
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,669
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you can make it six-six everywhere else.

321
00:15:41,331 --> 00:15:45,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, but on Steam, you could not make it six dollars and sixty-three.

322
00:15:45,531 --> 00:15:50,250
Speaker 0: It ended up being six-sixty-three, and that was as close as they could get it.

323
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:51,235
Speaker 1: Okay, so wait a second.

324
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:54,130
Speaker 1: So Steam is putting restrictions on the price you can set for a game.

325
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:59,650
Speaker 0: There are prices you can set, like, at tiers, and you can't go between those.

326
00:16:00,151 --> 00:16:01,153
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's the question.

327
00:16:01,173 --> 00:16:08,870
Speaker 1: If you're going to make tiers, why wouldn't they be something logical, like, every fifty cent, or every twenty-five cent, or, you know, something like that?

328
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,196
Speaker 1: Why would you even allow six-sixty-two?

329
00:16:11,216 --> 00:16:15,790
Speaker 1: Would you just only allow six-fifty, six-ninety-nine, seven-fifty, seven-ninety-nine?

330
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,630
Speaker 0: So it was going to be sold for six-sixty-six.

331
00:16:17,770 --> 00:16:19,530
Speaker 1: Maybe throw in seven-twenty-five and seven-four.

332
00:16:19,530 --> 00:16:25,690
Speaker 0: When it went live on Steam, it ended up being seven-ninety-nine, because that was the only price they could set.

333
00:16:26,011 --> 00:16:31,170
Speaker 0: So a seventeen percent discount was used to get it as close to six-sixty-six as possible.

334
00:16:31,630 --> 00:16:34,370
Speaker 1: Oh, you can set percent discounts to adjust the price.

335
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:46,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, so seven-ninety-nine, with a seventeen percent discount, got it to six-sixty-three, which is real close to the number that was actually the number of the beast in old documents, and also kind of close to six-sixty-six.

336
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:47,088
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

337
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:54,210
Speaker 1: So, uh, I was gonna- Why not just set it to nine-ninety-nine, so that you can be an upside-down Mark of the Beast?

338
00:16:54,310 --> 00:16:55,550
Speaker 0: 'Cause then it costs a lot more money.

339
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:58,429
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, steam premium price.

340
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:12,747
Speaker 0: So, uh, I was gonna talk about this in more detail, but literally between when I realized what was going on and when we came home to do the show, there's an article on Kotaku from three-ten p.m.

341
00:17:12,787 --> 00:17:14,709
Speaker 0: today talking about this, so...

342
00:17:15,670 --> 00:17:17,453
Speaker 1: There has to be maybe some other way, right?

343
00:17:17,473 --> 00:17:22,983
Speaker 1: Like, if you gave it, what if the price is, like, twelve, whatever, you set it at a fifty percent discount, right?

344
00:17:23,063 --> 00:17:27,270
Speaker 1: I feel like if you increased the percent discount, you could make a really high price and get it to six-sixty-six.

345
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:33,877
Speaker 0: Well, so I'm pretty sure the reasons steam does this kind of thing, there's a bunch of, like, back-end business reasons.

346
00:17:33,897 --> 00:17:45,430
Speaker 0: Like, for example, one of the really annoying things with, like, the Google Play Store or, I don't know, Amazon, is that you'll see things for sale for, like, five dollars and one cent, four dollars and ninety-six cents.

347
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:59,330
Speaker 0: Because they're trying to, like, game each other and appear at different parts in the listings and, you know, show, like, shave a penny off the price, but then add a penny to the shipping and all sorts of, like, weird arbitrage engineering nonsense.

348
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:06,200
Speaker 0: Also, it's probably more efficient to have pricing tiers and, like, standard discounts and standard stuff.

349
00:18:07,122 --> 00:18:11,450
Speaker 0: And pretty sure this is the only game in history where someone noticed and cared.

350
00:18:12,355 --> 00:18:13,401
Speaker 0: I think that's the end of it.

351
00:18:13,421 --> 00:18:14,890
Speaker 0: Someone noticed and cared.

352
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:17,208
Speaker 1: If I was selling Doom, I would sell it for six-six.

353
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:21,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we need John Carmack and John Romero.

354
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,869
Speaker 1: They're not working on the new Doom.

355
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:27,790
Speaker 0: I'm not saying they are, but I'm saying we need their voices to advocate that six-sixty-six needs to be an available tier.

356
00:18:27,810 --> 00:18:30,569
Speaker 1: But I think Doom will cost you sixty-six-sixty-six.

357
00:18:31,971 --> 00:18:34,210
Speaker 0: Or sixty-six-sixty, actually, would be better, I think.

358
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,769
Speaker 1: Sixty-nine-sixty-nine.

359
00:18:37,171 --> 00:18:39,050
Speaker 0: That's real close to our old Wi-Fi password.

360
00:18:39,392 --> 00:18:41,910
Speaker 1: You could have also given them a discount and made it cost four-twenty.

361
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:52,307
Speaker 0: And also, one of the other games, Hustlecat, where you can date cats that turn into cute people, is on Steam Greenlight, but hasn't made it over the line yet.

362
00:18:52,387 --> 00:18:54,170
Speaker 0: So, go click on it.

363
00:18:54,251 --> 00:18:55,670
Speaker 1: What happens if it makes it over the line?

364
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:56,890
Speaker 0: Then you can buy it on Steam.

365
00:18:57,691 --> 00:18:58,537
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's already done?

366
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,429
Speaker 1: You just can't buy it until it's...

367
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:04,950
Speaker 0: It's not done, but it's going to be for sale soon, but it can't be for sale on Steam.

368
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:07,410
Speaker 1: Then how come you can sell the Devil Game on Steam?

369
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:08,834
Speaker 0: Because it got over the line.

370
00:19:09,095 --> 00:19:13,086
Speaker 0: So, the Devil Game had a demographic that was very into it and got it greenlit.

371
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:14,410
Speaker 0: Way early.

372
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:16,082
Speaker 0: Also, that game is just out.

373
00:19:16,162 --> 00:19:16,889
Speaker 0: You can just buy it.

374
00:19:17,111 --> 00:19:19,090
Speaker 1: Ah, but the cat game needs help to get over the line.

375
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:20,670
Speaker 0: The cat game, I don't think enough people realize.

376
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:23,320
Speaker 1: You'll be able to pay six-sixty-two for the cat game.

377
00:19:23,641 --> 00:19:25,950
Speaker 1: You'll only be able to pay six-sixty-two for the Devil Game.

378
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:26,135
Speaker 1: Yup.

379
00:19:26,611 --> 00:19:28,365
Speaker 1: You'll have to buy the cat game from somewhere else.

380
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:28,990
Speaker 1: It's not Steam.

381
00:19:29,170 --> 00:19:31,670
Speaker 0: Yes, unless more people click yes on this thing.

382
00:19:31,931 --> 00:19:32,016
Speaker 1: Okay.

383
00:19:32,771 --> 00:19:36,510
Speaker 0: And that's why... Oh, there are, however, right now, on it, sixty-nine comments.

384
00:19:37,111 --> 00:19:37,495
Speaker 1: Alright.

385
00:19:37,515 --> 00:19:38,282
Speaker 0: Sounds good.

386
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,750
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day!

387
00:19:48,611 --> 00:19:53,330
Speaker 0: If you know me at all, in fact, I see that bustin' thing just looking at me as the first recommended video.

388
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:54,489
Speaker 1: Bustin', bustin', bustin'.

389
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,349
Speaker 0: Makes me feel good.

390
00:19:56,130 --> 00:20:00,590
Speaker 0: Neil Cicierega is the avatar of all the good parts of internet culture.

391
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:04,090
Speaker 0: Like, you know, in fantasy worlds, the god of whatever...

392
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,870
Speaker 1: We have sung his praises enough times.

393
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:10,570
Speaker 1: All you need to know is that there is a person named Neil Cicierega, and they are the person who has made all the things.

394
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, name ten weird internet things.

395
00:20:12,870 --> 00:20:16,929
Speaker 1: The creative genius of, perhaps, the half a generation younger than us.

396
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll put it this way.

397
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's younger than us.

398
00:20:19,891 --> 00:20:24,110
Speaker 0: Name, like, ten popular, well-known weird internet meme things.

399
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,070
Speaker 1: He's made half of them, probably.

400
00:20:25,111 --> 00:20:25,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, for real.

401
00:20:26,532 --> 00:20:28,469
Speaker 0: And he made an opus.

402
00:20:29,151 --> 00:20:31,450
Speaker 0: So, this is twenty-one minutes long.

403
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:35,449
Speaker 0: It is basically an entire TV episode titled "Computer

404
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:35,630
Speaker 0: Fighters."

405
00:20:36,993 --> 00:20:37,829
Speaker 0: Just watch it.

406
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:38,640
Speaker 0: Like, don't.

407
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,130
Speaker 1: Just watch it.

408
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:40,149
Speaker 1: You stole my thing of the day.

409
00:20:41,473 --> 00:20:42,770
Speaker 0: Hey, who backs his Patreon?

410
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,549
Speaker 1: This is the best thing that I've seen on the internet in weeks.

411
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:50,850
Speaker 0: It is the best thing I've seen on the internet, other than that suicide shower head that I'm gonna talk about next week.

412
00:20:51,310 --> 00:20:56,190
Speaker 0: But, the production values on this thing are pretty off the hook and independently.

413
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:57,641
Speaker 0: If you are around...

414
00:20:58,430 --> 00:21:02,289
Speaker 1: There's, like, this set of all-star people helping out, and it's like, "Oh, just he needed the

415
00:21:02,329 --> 00:21:02,490
Speaker 1: help.".

416
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:03,329
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, yeah.

417
00:21:03,554 --> 00:21:06,409
Speaker 1: If you're between twenty- That's the person who needs the help from all these geniuses.

418
00:21:06,630 --> 00:21:07,890
Speaker 1: The genius himself, sure.

419
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:13,470
Speaker 0: If you're between twenty-eight and thirty-eight years old, this is gonna hit real close to home in a lot of ways.

420
00:21:14,110 --> 00:21:16,269
Speaker 1: Alright, so I had to go to a backup thing of the day.

421
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:18,721
Speaker 1: So, there's a YouTube video called "Bolt for

422
00:21:18,741 --> 00:21:19,184
Speaker 1: Brilliance."

423
00:21:20,593 --> 00:21:23,690
Speaker 1: And in this video, a man bolts for brilliance.

424
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,790
Speaker 1: I don't know how much more I should talk about it, but I guess I will.

425
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:35,470
Speaker 1: So, you know how at sporting events, there's the old, especially soccer, especially in Europe, there's the streaker?

426
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:41,110
Speaker 0: They take it off, they run across the field, they get- I'm pulling up the video, I'm just gonna watch it while you're talking.

427
00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:45,190
Speaker 1: This is the full day in the life of the man who bolts for brilliance.

428
00:21:45,390 --> 00:21:50,390
Speaker 1: It begins with, you know, before even going to the stadium, you know, the preparations inside.

429
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:51,709
Speaker 0: Oh, this already looks real good.

430
00:21:52,130 --> 00:21:56,330
Speaker 1: And then, you know, climax with, you know, the event.

431
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:01,190
Speaker 1: Alright, so now you know what it's like to be a day in the life of a person with this occupation.

432
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:04,670
Speaker 1: What goes through their minds, why they're doing this, how they get it done.

433
00:22:05,233 --> 00:22:07,103
Speaker 0: This is- I don't even have the sound on.

434
00:22:07,123 --> 00:22:08,310
Speaker 0: This actually looks really great.

435
00:22:08,771 --> 00:22:09,330
Speaker 1: Proper techniques.

436
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:10,835
Speaker 0: He's like, he's ready.

437
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:13,290
Speaker 0: Like, he's got this really determined look on his face.

438
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,949
Speaker 1: Alright, you're almost at the really- the best part.

439
00:22:15,292 --> 00:22:16,109
Speaker 0: When he actually does it?

440
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:17,664
Speaker 0: Yeah, just- I see him queuing up.

441
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:19,409
Speaker 1: This is the best part, here it comes.

442
00:22:19,770 --> 00:22:21,490
Speaker 0: Okay, so he's queuing up his thing.

443
00:22:22,135 --> 00:22:22,770
Speaker 0: Oh, there he goes!

444
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:26,830
Speaker 0: The best part is the guy in yellow who goes like that.

445
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:28,662
Speaker 0: Is he flicking everybody?

446
00:22:28,703 --> 00:22:29,230
Speaker 0: Oh, he's waving.

447
00:22:33,631 --> 00:22:34,134
Speaker 0: The run.

448
00:22:34,154 --> 00:22:37,870
Speaker 0: I feel like if I watch the beginning of the video more, he practiced that run.

449
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,330
Speaker 0: The floppy arm thing he's doing.

450
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:42,989
Speaker 0: This is a pretty good thing of the day.

451
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,185
Speaker 1: Alright, there you go.

452
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:51,170
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, we're gonna do a new book club soon because nine books into the Wheel of Time.

453
00:22:51,710 --> 00:22:51,798
Speaker 0: Whoa!

454
00:22:53,274 --> 00:22:54,748
Speaker 0: I'm getting a little bored with it.

455
00:22:56,852 --> 00:23:00,250
Speaker 1: I made it to five- oh, I guess four and a quarter.

456
00:23:00,730 --> 00:23:02,204
Speaker 0: I am almost done with book nine.

457
00:23:02,224 --> 00:23:02,729
Speaker 0: I gotta tell ya.

458
00:23:03,751 --> 00:23:04,729
Speaker 0: I started skimming.

459
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:09,339
Speaker 0: Because- but then I thought, you know what?

460
00:23:09,781 --> 00:23:11,730
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll just read the spoilers.

461
00:23:11,950 --> 00:23:13,950
Speaker 0: 'Cause I kinda wanna know, like, what the deal is with everything.

462
00:23:14,437 --> 00:23:15,089
Speaker 1: Oh, tell me.

463
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I started trying to read some spoilers.

464
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,150
Speaker 0: The spoilers are so dense that I might as well just fucking read the book.

465
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:22,839
Speaker 0: Here's the cliff note.

466
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,890
Speaker 1: It's bigger than the book.

467
00:23:24,254 --> 00:23:25,730
Speaker 1: It's like our Utena video.

468
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,810
Speaker 1: It's longer than the Utena episode.

469
00:23:27,932 --> 00:23:28,989
Speaker 0: Remember the oath rod thing?

470
00:23:29,711 --> 00:23:32,330
Speaker 0: So, now there's like four oath rods all over the place.

471
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:33,990
Speaker 0: People are fucking using them for everything.

472
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:34,949
Speaker 0: Like, all the time.

473
00:23:35,430 --> 00:23:37,730
Speaker 0: And apparently they learned that the oath rod has side effects.

474
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,329
Speaker 0: And I tried to learn what the deal was with that.

475
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:40,767
Speaker 1: Why would you want to make so many oaths?

476
00:23:42,193 --> 00:23:43,229
Speaker 0: Maybe to find the black aja.

477
00:23:44,511 --> 00:23:44,808
Speaker 1: Okay.

478
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:46,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe to be like, "Yo, swear that you're not black

479
00:23:47,008 --> 00:23:47,190
Speaker 0: aja.".

480
00:23:47,535 --> 00:23:48,187
Speaker 0: Oh, you won't?

481
00:23:50,813 --> 00:23:52,309
Speaker 0: Also, the oath rods are real bad news.

482
00:23:53,115 --> 00:23:55,030
Speaker 0: Like, real bad news.

483
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,690
Speaker 1: Did you find anything about the snake people?

484
00:23:57,606 --> 00:23:57,669
Speaker 0: No.

485
00:23:59,114 --> 00:24:00,450
Speaker 0: So, here's what I got.

486
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:09,129
Speaker 0: In the beginning of, I think, book eight, or it might have been book nine, there's a scene way in the mountains with a bunch of people you've never heard of who are all like kings of whatever.

487
00:24:09,551 --> 00:24:10,809
Speaker 1: Ooh, my kind of scene.

488
00:24:11,231 --> 00:24:14,430
Speaker 0: One of them has a logo on his thing.

489
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,247
Speaker 1: Of the snake people?

490
00:24:15,471 --> 00:24:17,070
Speaker 0: No, of the fox head.

491
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:17,886
Speaker 1: Okay.

492
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:20,189
Speaker 0: And then it cut away from them.

493
00:24:20,916 --> 00:24:22,190
Speaker 0: And now it's been like two books.

494
00:24:22,652 --> 00:24:23,488
Speaker 0: And they haven't come back.

495
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,029
Speaker 1: Those are my people.

496
00:24:28,614 --> 00:24:30,110
Speaker 0: That is literally as close as I've gotten to them.

497
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,969
Speaker 0: So, I might pick a different book club book.

498
00:24:33,832 --> 00:24:36,590
Speaker 0: Partly because I got some travel to London and Paris coming up in a few months.

499
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:39,510
Speaker 0: So, I'll have an airplane ride or four to read some books.

500
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,230
Speaker 0: But, most important, this weekend.

501
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:43,489
Speaker 0: This weekend.

502
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:44,469
Speaker 1: Well, this week.

503
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,350
Speaker 1: Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

504
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:48,630
Speaker 0: We're going to be at MagFest.

505
00:24:51,011 --> 00:24:52,709
Speaker 0: I'm real excited about this.

506
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:56,110
Speaker 1: I mean, this is serious business.

507
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,850
Speaker 1: Like, everyone is going to be there.

508
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, one, we skipped the last MagFest.

509
00:25:00,470 --> 00:25:01,710
Speaker 1: Well, because PacSouth is the same time.

510
00:25:01,950 --> 00:25:07,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so as a result, I just realized that it's been a long time since I've been to a MagFest.

511
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,369
Speaker 0: And I remembered how much I love MagFest.

512
00:25:10,550 --> 00:25:12,230
Speaker 1: This MagFest, everyone is going.

513
00:25:12,370 --> 00:25:14,210
Speaker 1: Our Google Hangout already has like 30 people.

514
00:25:14,370 --> 00:25:17,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're going to need multiple separate Google Hangouts to manage these people.

515
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:19,988
Speaker 1: Yeah, this shit is going down hard, right?

516
00:25:21,190 --> 00:25:22,797
Speaker 0: We've already planned a 4 a.m.

517
00:25:22,838 --> 00:25:23,621
Speaker 0: DDR party.

518
00:25:23,661 --> 00:25:25,650
Speaker 0: that I was kind of jokingly proposing.

519
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,788
Speaker 0: And a bunch of people were like,

520
00:25:26,808 --> 00:25:26,869
Speaker 0: "Yes.".

521
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,628
Speaker 1: You just keep saying it over and over again.

522
00:25:29,131 --> 00:25:31,060
Speaker 0: Because people keep responding to me like, "Yes.

523
00:25:31,663 --> 00:25:32,044
Speaker 0: Yes.

524
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:32,989
Speaker 0: Let's do

525
00:25:33,049 --> 00:25:33,089
Speaker 0: it.".

526
00:25:33,311 --> 00:25:35,550
Speaker 1: Alright, so what panels are we doing at this MagFest?

527
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,450
Speaker 0: So, we have six panels at this MagFest.

528
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:39,376
Speaker 1: That's too many panels.

529
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,290
Speaker 1: I want to spend more time at MagFest, less time panel.

530
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,650
Speaker 0: You're only on five of them, though.

531
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,130
Speaker 0: No, you're on four of them, I think.

532
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,110
Speaker 1: Okay, that's better.

533
00:25:46,572 --> 00:25:49,082
Speaker 0: So, Thursday, 5.30 p.m.

534
00:25:49,444 --> 00:25:49,946
Speaker 0: Esports.

535
00:25:50,006 --> 00:25:50,850
Speaker 0: It's a panel about Esports.

536
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:51,689
Speaker 1: Am I on that one?

537
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:52,457
Speaker 0: Yes.

538
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:53,570
Speaker 0: Thursday, whatever.

539
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:55,223
Speaker 0: Friday is our big day.

540
00:25:55,264 --> 00:25:55,770
Speaker 0: We front-loaded.

541
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:59,830
Speaker 0: So, Friday, we got Designing Game Rules, Atari Game Design.

542
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:02,585
Speaker 0: If you saw us do those at PacSouth, basically the same.

543
00:26:02,605 --> 00:26:03,129
Speaker 0: You don't need to go.

544
00:26:03,891 --> 00:26:06,589
Speaker 0: And The Far Future of Gaming, which Scott does not have to be on.

545
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:07,286
Speaker 1: Alright, yeah.

546
00:26:08,274 --> 00:26:08,590
Speaker 1: Saturday.

547
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:09,230
Speaker 1: Gonna party it up.

548
00:26:09,631 --> 00:26:12,130
Speaker 0: All Things is CCG, LCG, TCG.

549
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:14,489
Speaker 1: I guess I gotta be on that because it was my idea.

550
00:26:14,570 --> 00:26:18,289
Speaker 1: Even though I contributed nothing to it, other than saying, "Hey, does anyone want to talk about

551
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:18,450
Speaker 1: this?".

552
00:26:18,511 --> 00:26:19,726
Speaker 1: That's literally all I said.

553
00:26:19,766 --> 00:26:20,070
Speaker 1: Literally.

554
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,201
Speaker 0: I think someone's got some slides.

555
00:26:22,410 --> 00:26:23,601
Speaker 1: I said, "Hey, does anyone...".

556
00:26:23,722 --> 00:26:24,650
Speaker 1: I play Netrunner a lot.

557
00:26:24,730 --> 00:26:27,106
Speaker 1: "Does anyone want to do a panel about card games and

558
00:26:27,126 --> 00:26:27,327
Speaker 1: shit?".

559
00:26:27,912 --> 00:26:29,970
Speaker 1: And that's paraphrasing, but that's all I said.

560
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:31,769
Speaker 1: And then now the panel's on the schedule.

561
00:26:32,371 --> 00:26:33,130
Speaker 0: It's gonna happen.

562
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,590
Speaker 1: I guess my name is on it.

563
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:40,270
Speaker 0: And then Overly Complicated Board Games Phase 1, which Scott does not have to be on.

564
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:40,873
Speaker 1: Okay, good.

565
00:26:40,893 --> 00:26:42,382
Speaker 1: I don't want to play any ASL.

566
00:26:42,663 --> 00:26:43,730
Speaker 1: I was only joking about that.

567
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,516
Speaker 0: Six panels.

568
00:26:46,342 --> 00:26:47,530
Speaker 0: Thursday, Friday, Saturday.

569
00:26:48,211 --> 00:26:53,650
Speaker 0: And other than that, we're pretty much gonna be in the arcade or in tabletop or in a private room playing Eclipse.

570
00:26:53,891 --> 00:26:54,346
Speaker 1: That's right.

571
00:26:55,590 --> 00:26:56,333
Speaker 0: So come say hi.

572
00:26:56,614 --> 00:27:01,070
Speaker 0: This is one of the few cons where you can easily find us and hang out for a while.

573
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, there isn't a super big concert I want to go to, but there were some concerts I kind of want to go to, right?

574
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,599
Speaker 1: There was this video game.

575
00:27:08,639 --> 00:27:10,110
Speaker 1: DJ battle is always good.

576
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,969
Speaker 0: I think I'm gonna wander into concerts.

577
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:12,596
Speaker 1: Mighty No.

578
00:27:12,596 --> 00:27:13,930
Speaker 1: 9 tribute something.

579
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:20,749
Speaker 1: There's some stuff on there, but it wasn't like two times ago that I went to MAGFest where Streets of Rage guy was there.

580
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:24,869
Speaker 1: Or when Machine Supremacy was there the time we went and then the time we didn't go.

581
00:27:26,090 --> 00:27:28,450
Speaker 0: I think I Fight Dragons is doing some stuff.

582
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:29,088
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

583
00:27:29,790 --> 00:27:30,208
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

584
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:32,136
Speaker 0: So MAGFest.

585
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:34,749
Speaker 0: Well, if you're not going, I mean, I don't know if it's sold out.

586
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,986
Speaker 1: It's not sold out, but it's gonna be hard to get a hotel.

587
00:27:37,026 --> 00:27:37,450
Speaker 1: that's close.

588
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:38,392
Speaker 0: Yeah.

589
00:27:39,416 --> 00:27:40,581
Speaker 0: In fact, I don't know.

590
00:27:40,601 --> 00:27:42,530
Speaker 0: I guess you could get a hotel far away and drive in.

591
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:44,410
Speaker 0: A lot of people are driving in like our friend George.

592
00:27:44,973 --> 00:27:47,270
Speaker 1: It also might be close to sold out, right?

593
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,150
Speaker 1: So you might have issues if you try to like show up and buy a ticket.

594
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:51,869
Speaker 1: It could be sold out by the time you get there.

595
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:54,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, but for real, the clock is ringing.

596
00:27:54,584 --> 00:27:55,610
Speaker 0: It's MAGFest time.

597
00:27:56,531 --> 00:28:00,370
Speaker 0: And then we got pretty much nothing until like zinc icon in PAX East.

598
00:28:01,893 --> 00:28:07,070
Speaker 0: So yesterday, actually, we were gonna do a game day and I had a little bit of alien that I was fighting off.

599
00:28:07,452 --> 00:28:10,390
Speaker 0: So Scott was like, well, here, why don't we play online games?

600
00:28:10,610 --> 00:28:14,430
Speaker 1: Well, me and Chris are going to come over here and play some serious tabletops.

601
00:28:14,710 --> 00:28:16,958
Speaker 1: But then, you know, you didn't commit.

602
00:28:17,058 --> 00:28:20,310
Speaker 1: And then it's like, well, you know, it's really snowy and shitty.

603
00:28:20,792 --> 00:28:22,130
Speaker 1: No one wants to leave their apartment.

604
00:28:22,611 --> 00:28:26,750
Speaker 0: I would have been totally up for it, except I was, you know, that feeling where you're almost sick.

605
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:31,390
Speaker 0: And one, if I was going to get sick, I couldn't risk getting other people sick before MAGFest.

606
00:28:32,233 --> 00:28:35,070
Speaker 0: Two, I needed to make sure I recovered, which I appear to have.

607
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,635
Speaker 1: So I'm like, hey, let's play a vidya game.

608
00:28:36,675 --> 00:28:41,810
Speaker 1: So actually we found this site that's like still working on some like online thing where you can play board games.

609
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:45,467
Speaker 1: And we played some Reiner Knizia Samurai, which I remember how to play now.

610
00:28:45,587 --> 00:28:46,070
Speaker 1: That game's OK.

611
00:28:46,431 --> 00:28:47,824
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the one with the high hats.

612
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:52,250
Speaker 1: They changed it to Buddha's helmets or Gates helmets and rice bowls.

613
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:52,987
Speaker 0: No more Buddhas?

614
00:28:53,953 --> 00:28:55,970
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, the gate is up to a Buddhist temple.

615
00:28:57,191 --> 00:28:59,150
Speaker 0: That's the second best game named Shogun.

616
00:28:59,872 --> 00:29:00,133
Speaker 1: Yeah.

617
00:29:00,455 --> 00:29:01,924
Speaker 1: Anyway, we played Samurai.

618
00:29:04,722 --> 00:29:04,986
Speaker 1: I don't know.

619
00:29:05,006 --> 00:29:05,310
Speaker 1: Whatever.

620
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:06,370
Speaker 0: No, it was Shogun.

621
00:29:06,611 --> 00:29:07,890
Speaker 0: It got renamed Samurai swords.

622
00:29:08,592 --> 00:29:12,830
Speaker 1: And then anyway, so, you know, we're just looking for a game to play online.

623
00:29:13,170 --> 00:29:19,528
Speaker 1: And we're sort of it's hard to actually find games that are a good good enough.

624
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:20,351
Speaker 1: Right.

625
00:29:20,371 --> 00:29:25,170
Speaker 1: And that you can play online on a PC with some sort of co-op situation.

626
00:29:25,170 --> 00:29:25,331
Speaker 1: Right.

627
00:29:25,351 --> 00:29:29,670
Speaker 1: There's a lot of local co-op, a lot of local multiplayer, a lot of more than two people games.

628
00:29:30,331 --> 00:29:31,700
Speaker 1: But it's hard to find two people games.

629
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,310
Speaker 1: They're just going through steam looking for them.

630
00:29:33,932 --> 00:29:35,950
Speaker 1: And it's like we already played like Portal two co-op.

631
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:36,674
Speaker 1: And it's not like.

632
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:39,209
Speaker 1: how many FPS are there that we can find that are co-op.

633
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:39,732
Speaker 1: Right.

634
00:29:39,773 --> 00:29:40,398
Speaker 1: That would be fun.

635
00:29:40,458 --> 00:29:41,830
Speaker 1: But there's not a lot of them.

636
00:29:42,131 --> 00:29:46,690
Speaker 1: So we come across this one called Helldivers and I'm like, oh, this looks interesting.

637
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:49,810
Speaker 1: You know, it's a. it's sort of like a robotron shooter.

638
00:29:49,951 --> 00:29:51,530
Speaker 1: That's always good for some co-op action.

639
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:52,801
Speaker 0: That's all Scott told me about it.

640
00:29:52,842 --> 00:29:53,590
Speaker 0: So I just joined it.

641
00:29:53,630 --> 00:29:54,637
Speaker 1: I didn't know anything about it.

642
00:29:54,678 --> 00:29:56,390
Speaker 1: I just thought, oh, it's a robotron game.

643
00:29:56,931 --> 00:29:59,930
Speaker 1: It costs 20 bucks, which I'd rather wait for a steam sale.

644
00:30:00,471 --> 00:30:00,854
Speaker 1: But you know what?

645
00:30:00,894 --> 00:30:01,177
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

646
00:30:01,197 --> 00:30:02,530
Speaker 1: It's really cold out and I got nothing to do.

647
00:30:02,630 --> 00:30:03,314
Speaker 1: Let's just do this.

648
00:30:04,059 --> 00:30:05,830
Speaker 1: We'll do an episode on it, even if it sucks.

649
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,559
Speaker 1: It'll you know, we'll get our 20 bucks worth.

650
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,389
Speaker 1: Plus there's that steam refund policy.

651
00:30:10,572 --> 00:30:12,589
Speaker 1: I can always return it real quick if it's really bad.

652
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:13,152
Speaker 0: Yeah.

653
00:30:13,213 --> 00:30:14,650
Speaker 0: So you and Chris played for a little while.

654
00:30:15,010 --> 00:30:17,010
Speaker 1: Played for a little while while Rim got his shit together.

655
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:22,270
Speaker 0: Well, because I was in the middle of uploading actually the archival footage from Pac South to Amazon Cloud Drive.

656
00:30:22,371 --> 00:30:23,426
Speaker 1: I'll get my SD card back.

657
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:23,730
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

658
00:30:25,832 --> 00:30:27,482
Speaker 1: So the card anyway.

659
00:30:27,623 --> 00:30:28,670
Speaker 1: So we get this game.

660
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,018
Speaker 1: So here's what I learned about this game.

661
00:30:30,058 --> 00:30:31,770
Speaker 1: First of all, it's made by the people in Magica.

662
00:30:32,371 --> 00:30:37,230
Speaker 1: So they have experience with the sort of twin stick action, you know, of that.

663
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:38,697
Speaker 1: Magica was right.

664
00:30:38,757 --> 00:30:40,506
Speaker 1: So they're good at this, too.

665
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:42,573
Speaker 1: I learned from Wikipedia.

666
00:30:42,614 --> 00:30:47,410
Speaker 1: this game was actually a PlayStation game that was released in March of 2015.

667
00:30:47,410 --> 00:30:51,851
Speaker 1: So it's like it's a year old, but it wasn't put on steam until December 2015.

668
00:30:51,851 --> 00:30:56,130
Speaker 1: So it's actually a really new steam game and you could only play it on steam.

669
00:30:56,670 --> 00:30:58,120
Speaker 1: You don't play with the PlayStation people.

670
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:58,704
Speaker 0: Thank God.

671
00:30:58,724 --> 00:30:59,609
Speaker 0: Right.

672
00:31:00,272 --> 00:31:02,950
Speaker 1: So you're all you know, it's only steam people when you play with steam.

673
00:31:03,671 --> 00:31:06,719
Speaker 1: So it's a robotron shooter.

674
00:31:07,541 --> 00:31:11,230
Speaker 1: And the story is there's this super Starship Troopers.

675
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:12,921
Speaker 0: The story is Starship Troopers.

676
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:13,969
Speaker 1: It's Super Earth.

677
00:31:14,531 --> 00:31:16,057
Speaker 0: You're on super democracy.

678
00:31:16,378 --> 00:31:19,170
Speaker 1: You're from Super Earth and you're basically evil.

679
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:20,212
Speaker 0: Yeah.

680
00:31:20,453 --> 00:31:21,678
Speaker 0: And the game doesn't even like.

681
00:31:21,698 --> 00:31:23,786
Speaker 0: the propaganda video that plays.

682
00:31:23,826 --> 00:31:26,780
Speaker 0: in the beginning is like, hey, we're evil.

683
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:28,610
Speaker 1: Join the Helldivers.

684
00:31:28,830 --> 00:31:33,429
Speaker 1: Go to some other planet and fuck it up and bring them managed democracy.

685
00:31:33,950 --> 00:31:36,310
Speaker 0: The new when you first start the game after you do the tutorial.

686
00:31:36,651 --> 00:31:40,890
Speaker 0: I love how the tutorial is like like it's like take pick up your gun and shoot that target.

687
00:31:40,990 --> 00:31:43,850
Speaker 0: You shoot it once and it's like you are now a firearms expert.

688
00:31:44,210 --> 00:31:45,457
Speaker 0: Move on to the next training.

689
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:47,630
Speaker 0: You are now a grenade expert.

690
00:31:48,293 --> 00:31:48,554
Speaker 0: Right.

691
00:31:48,594 --> 00:31:50,543
Speaker 0: And then it gets you into the first NPC.

692
00:31:50,583 --> 00:31:52,050
Speaker 0: I talked to the whole game.

693
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:56,750
Speaker 0: The guy who salutes you in the bottom right just said, why is our logo a skull?

694
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:58,833
Speaker 1: Good question.

695
00:31:59,797 --> 00:32:00,680
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

696
00:32:00,921 --> 00:32:03,030
Speaker 1: So there's three different evil alien races.

697
00:32:03,391 --> 00:32:05,862
Speaker 1: There's the aliens, the cyborgs and the one I forget.

698
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,450
Speaker 1: I forget bugs.

699
00:32:08,150 --> 00:32:10,820
Speaker 1: No bugs, cyborgs and I don't know.

700
00:32:10,860 --> 00:32:13,670
Speaker 1: I've only ever seen bugs because we only chose bug levels.

701
00:32:13,911 --> 00:32:14,172
Speaker 0: Yeah.

702
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:14,794
Speaker 1: Right.

703
00:32:15,075 --> 00:32:19,090
Speaker 1: So you go and choose, you know, some mission based on his difficulty.

704
00:32:20,431 --> 00:32:30,030
Speaker 1: And you have to do certain objectives and then, you know, evac the planet, you know, after you do whatever missions there are and then you succeed in a certain number of missions per planet.

705
00:32:30,492 --> 00:32:33,070
Speaker 1: And once you do all the missions on the planet, you succeeded at that planet.

706
00:32:33,210 --> 00:32:38,910
Speaker 1: And now you can go do another planet somewhere and you bring with you one to four Helldivers.

707
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:41,470
Speaker 1: You and up to three other people could be random Internet people.

708
00:32:41,591 --> 00:32:44,470
Speaker 1: Could be your friends, could be you alone, you know, whatever.

709
00:32:46,172 --> 00:32:47,255
Speaker 1: And you do these missions.

710
00:32:47,938 --> 00:32:51,790
Speaker 1: And at first you start playing the game and it seems like way too easy.

711
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,720
Speaker 1: Like the easiest missions are baby missions.

712
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,690
Speaker 1: Like you shoot one thing and you just do it.

713
00:32:55,730 --> 00:32:56,394
Speaker 1: It's done right.

714
00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:58,850
Speaker 1: But the difficulty gets up pretty high.

715
00:32:59,530 --> 00:33:03,010
Speaker 0: And then I knew it was good because I was yelling so much that Emily was like, simmer down.

716
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:03,631
Speaker 1: Right.

717
00:33:04,072 --> 00:33:08,890
Speaker 1: And it seemed, you know, I started playing the game a bunch and it really felt like there wasn't a lot of variation.

718
00:33:08,950 --> 00:33:09,834
Speaker 1: Like I was getting a little bored.

719
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:13,730
Speaker 1: I was like, hey, we've been shooting the same bugs and doing the same objectives.

720
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:16,537
Speaker 1: This is getting kind of old fast.

721
00:33:16,618 --> 00:33:16,939
Speaker 1: Right.

722
00:33:16,959 --> 00:33:17,340
Speaker 1: Can we.

723
00:33:17,762 --> 00:33:19,187
Speaker 1: Is there any variation here?

724
00:33:19,267 --> 00:33:19,909
Speaker 1: What's going on?

725
00:33:20,611 --> 00:33:27,630
Speaker 1: So the thing is, yeah, there's actually a shit ton of variation that it just you don't see it until you like get deep into it.

726
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:33,150
Speaker 1: Like the depth is like way deep, but you can't like see the bottom of the pool.

727
00:33:33,251 --> 00:33:36,149
Speaker 1: You just got to keep swimming slower, like inch by inch.

728
00:33:36,411 --> 00:33:38,723
Speaker 0: Like at first we thought, like, let's just drop right on the objectives.

729
00:33:38,763 --> 00:33:40,010
Speaker 0: And then that started to not work.

730
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:41,874
Speaker 0: So we had to like plan our routes.

731
00:33:41,995 --> 00:33:54,489
Speaker 1: And it's like with such small amounts of stuff, like so few weapons and so few different enemies, like the amount of thinking that had to go into everything and like, you know, the gameplay variation we had to get into was actually like, whoa.

732
00:33:54,970 --> 00:34:03,450
Speaker 0: So the way it actually plays the game that it is closest to and this might sound strange, but I'm going to stick by this is the original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

733
00:34:03,671 --> 00:34:09,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, it definitely closes today because that game started out like, all right, just hit the bad guys, whatever.

734
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:18,290
Speaker 0: But as you got deep and toward the end of the original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, you started figuring out how to do those like really complicated spell combos.

735
00:34:18,870 --> 00:34:32,070
Speaker 0: Suddenly, the game was like a squad of like Scott doing stuff while me and Katsu are literally like coordinating with each other, with code words to figure out like what attacks to do to make sure we time everything, coordinate everything right.

736
00:34:32,371 --> 00:34:34,983
Speaker 0: And we started having to act like a really pro unit.

737
00:34:35,405 --> 00:34:36,510
Speaker 0: And this game is the same way.

738
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:43,330
Speaker 0: Like we sort of had this roll out phase where like we get our shit together and I'd roll out a turret and you guys would do whatever you were doing and then we go.

739
00:34:43,690 --> 00:34:47,420
Speaker 1: The key is there's three keys that make this happen.

740
00:34:47,561 --> 00:34:50,710
Speaker 1: Key number one is they don't let you go off the screen from the other people.

741
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:58,850
Speaker 1: So if one person is going up and I was going down, you just get killed doing that because that person on top will get killed by something that's off screen to the top that you can't see.

742
00:34:59,432 --> 00:35:03,850
Speaker 1: And then the person at the bottom will get killed by something off the bottom of the screen that you can't see because you were trying to split up.

743
00:35:04,250 --> 00:35:07,690
Speaker 1: And the camera won't zoom out after a certain point and you'll just be screwed.

744
00:35:08,472 --> 00:35:11,210
Speaker 1: So that makes like Crystal Chronicles with a bucket where you have to stay together.

745
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:15,260
Speaker 1: Number two, friendly fire is serious shit.

746
00:35:15,862 --> 00:35:18,350
Speaker 1: Like if you even shoot your teammate once, they dead.

747
00:35:18,750 --> 00:35:22,770
Speaker 0: Like you know most games like this, like you can throw down a turret and it shoots the bad guys automatically.

748
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:27,190
Speaker 0: The turret in this game is utterly ridiculously powerful.

749
00:35:27,491 --> 00:35:31,370
Speaker 1: It's also really stupid and will shoot you if you were between it and the bad guy.

750
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:38,250
Speaker 0: There was a moment where I literally threw, I had two turrets on either side of me and then a bug, like a camouflage bug jumped on top of me.

751
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:41,045
Speaker 0: And the two turrets, I see them spinning around and I'm like,

752
00:35:41,065 --> 00:35:41,145
Speaker 0: "Welp.".

753
00:35:43,251 --> 00:35:46,182
Speaker 1: So yeah, the turrets will, you know, there are many, many things.

754
00:35:46,202 --> 00:35:47,186
Speaker 1: For example, there are mechs.

755
00:35:47,206 --> 00:35:48,010
Speaker 1: You didn't see the mechs.

756
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:49,329
Speaker 1: I haven't seen any mechs.

757
00:35:49,490 --> 00:35:50,036
Speaker 1: I played online.

758
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:51,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of stuff you didn't see.

759
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:57,689
Speaker 1: And it's like, yeah, if you're piloting the mech, you can just step on people by accident who aren't in the mech.

760
00:35:58,290 --> 00:36:06,750
Speaker 0: Well, you can call down, I remember there was Scott, so Chris and I died and Scott was running away and he like threw down the thing to call in reinforcements, basically to respawn us.

761
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:12,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can respawn your friends just by throwing this object, but you have to like get to a place to do it safely.

762
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:19,050
Speaker 0: So then you got like attacked by some other guy and he pushed you back and then the respawn thing fell from the sky on top of you, killing you.

763
00:36:19,493 --> 00:36:20,169
Speaker 1: Yup, exactly.

764
00:36:20,392 --> 00:36:22,270
Speaker 0: Or like the chopper, like at the end you have to get to the chopper.

765
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:25,190
Speaker 1: There's all these things that you can call for to come help you.

766
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:34,030
Speaker 1: Stratagems, and you basically throw an object as a stratagem and then, you know, the helldivers in the sky drop something and it lands in the spot that you threw the stratagem.

767
00:36:34,110 --> 00:36:35,515
Speaker 0: Now there's two great aspects there.

768
00:36:35,636 --> 00:36:39,330
Speaker 0: One, the stratagems and the weapons and everything have an upgrade tech tree, which is fun.

769
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:46,730
Speaker 0: And two, to actually deploy them, it's Sabin style Final Fantasy VI, like left, left, right, left, up, up, down, left, right.

770
00:36:47,072 --> 00:36:48,190
Speaker 1: Yup, it's like doing a blitz.

771
00:36:48,431 --> 00:36:56,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, so like some of the objectives are like that too, so like to arm the nuke you got to go over and be like bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup, bup while everyone else is doing their shit.

772
00:36:56,490 --> 00:37:00,150
Speaker 1: So actually we were using the hellbombs to do that mission where you blow up the nests.

773
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:00,520
Speaker 0: Yup.

774
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:05,930
Speaker 1: People I played with just had actual nukes and just called them in and blew up the nests immediately without having to activate some stupid thing.

775
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:06,272
Speaker 1: Oh.

776
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there is just better stuff, right, that you can get.

777
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,908
Speaker 0: Would the air strike do it?

778
00:37:11,891 --> 00:37:15,665
Speaker 1: I mean there's certain things that can damage the nests because they're strong enough and certain things that can't.

779
00:37:15,685 --> 00:37:16,970
Speaker 1: I think they have tank level armors.

780
00:37:17,131 --> 00:37:22,250
Speaker 1: Actually, my recoilless rifle could have destroyed them if we shot them enough times.

781
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,190
Speaker 0: And then yeah, like talking about the depth, so Scott had the recoilless rifle.

782
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:27,513
Speaker 1: Which is a really fun weapon.

783
00:37:28,155 --> 00:37:29,939
Speaker 1: Once I figured out how to use it, I was way into it.

784
00:37:29,959 --> 00:37:34,050
Speaker 1: Because basically any time a really big bad guy appears, it really sucks to kill it.

785
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,695
Speaker 1: Especially because ammo is so limited.

786
00:37:36,136 --> 00:37:41,250
Speaker 1: But if the recoilless rifle is like this special thing, it's actually a stratagem that you call down and then pick up.

787
00:37:41,791 --> 00:37:44,144
Speaker 1: You shoot it once and if you hit them dead on, they dead.

788
00:37:44,204 --> 00:37:45,170
Speaker 1: And I got really good at that.

789
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:49,105
Speaker 0: And it felt really good because we'd be like fighting and suddenly Chris would yell "Big one coming

790
00:37:49,185 --> 00:37:49,266
Speaker 0: in!"

791
00:37:49,306 --> 00:37:50,270
Speaker 0: and then you see it coming in.

792
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:53,770
Speaker 1: So I just switch to that weapon, I aim and I fire my one rocket and boom, it's dead.

793
00:37:53,790 --> 00:37:58,530
Speaker 0: While the two of us fall back and cover Scott while he's aiming from all the little bugs that are coming in.

794
00:37:58,690 --> 00:38:03,170
Speaker 1: Right, if I hit something, and a lot of times I would shoot it and hit something too close to myself and kill myself.

795
00:38:04,332 --> 00:38:06,182
Speaker 1: Or something would get in the way and it wouldn't work.

796
00:38:06,282 --> 00:38:07,609
Speaker 1: But mostly I hit the bad guys with it.

797
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:10,950
Speaker 0: A lot of stuff too, like the medevac copter coming down.

798
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:19,890
Speaker 1: So reloading the recoilless rifle is really slow, but I found out when playing with people online that there's actually this supply pack that goes with it.

799
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:25,227
Speaker 1: So Rym picked up my supply pack once and I was like "Rym, you took my stupid supply pack, how can I reload this stupid rifle now?

800
00:38:25,287 --> 00:38:25,488
Speaker 1: Fuck

801
00:38:25,508 --> 00:38:25,608
Speaker 1: you.".

802
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:29,460
Speaker 1: Apparently, if Rym has the supply pack, there's a reason it's separate.

803
00:38:29,721 --> 00:38:32,630
Speaker 1: He can help me reload the thing and it would take much less time.

804
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,309
Speaker 0: That's real important.

805
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:35,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't know that.

806
00:38:36,461 --> 00:38:37,890
Speaker 1: So now that we know that, that's great.

807
00:38:38,311 --> 00:38:45,790
Speaker 0: So take all the gameplay feels of Crystal Chronicles, coupled with an upgrade tree that's more like a Deus Ex, like there's legit upgrade tree in there.

808
00:38:46,110 --> 00:38:48,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's all co-op, there's no PVP at all.

809
00:38:48,699 --> 00:38:51,769
Speaker 1: It's always you and up to three other people fighting against the AI.

810
00:38:52,191 --> 00:38:53,749
Speaker 0: Oh, I figured out what the SOS does too.

811
00:38:54,270 --> 00:38:55,570
Speaker 1: Oh, it calls people from the internet to come help you.

812
00:38:55,570 --> 00:38:57,230
Speaker 0: It calls a rando into your game.

813
00:38:57,390 --> 00:38:58,824
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like "Internet, come help

814
00:38:58,926 --> 00:38:58,986
Speaker 1: us.".

815
00:38:59,490 --> 00:39:04,270
Speaker 0: So there's theoretically a persistent meta, where as you level up, you just get better.

816
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:10,950
Speaker 0: This is not a game that you would play forever, because once you've upgraded everything, I'm pretty sure...

817
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:16,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're playing the same missions, and eventually when you do the hell dive level missions, those are the hardest possible missions.

818
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:20,870
Speaker 1: If you've done enough of those and you've leveled up all the stuff, there's really not a reason to keep playing.

819
00:39:21,170 --> 00:39:25,190
Speaker 0: And that is when you stop playing the game, because it was only 20 bucks and you put like 60 hours into this thing.

820
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:32,890
Speaker 1: But whenever you complete a mission, you actually have community influence, so this actually boosts the war effort in general with these points.

821
00:39:33,431 --> 00:39:41,669
Speaker 1: So as the war effort progresses, eventually there's like a final mission, and then I think the game ends as a whole, and then there's another war.

822
00:39:41,709 --> 00:39:42,170
Speaker 1: that happens.

823
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:44,395
Speaker 0: So they're like events, like it can go the other way.

824
00:39:44,456 --> 00:39:49,870
Speaker 0: If the bugs start winning or whatever, like if one of the bad guys wins, then there's emergency missions that pop up.

825
00:39:50,190 --> 00:39:54,230
Speaker 0: Like, right now, whoever's online, fucking get in here, and you have to defend a city.

826
00:39:55,070 --> 00:40:00,810
Speaker 0: But those are like, it starts at two o'clock, like right the fuck now, if you don't join, you miss out.

827
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, the stuff like that.

828
00:40:02,491 --> 00:40:12,230
Speaker 1: So the only negative in this game that I found is that there's a lot of DLCs that cost money, and those DLCs are not trivial.

829
00:40:12,330 --> 00:40:19,210
Speaker 1: For example, there are all-terrain boots that you can buy as a perk, and with real money you can get these.

830
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,618
Speaker 1: You can't get them any other way, as far as I know.

831
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:25,410
Speaker 1: The all-terrain boots, they make it so you just walk in snow and water no problem.

832
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:26,450
Speaker 0: Oh, that's some bullshit.

833
00:40:26,751 --> 00:40:32,390
Speaker 1: Right, but obviously there's still a perk, so you'd have to get rid of your laser sight, because you only carry one perk on you.

834
00:40:32,410 --> 00:40:33,789
Speaker 0: I would give up my laser sight for that.

835
00:40:33,950 --> 00:40:43,939
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, for example, so there's certain things that cost money and are just better, but it's all co-op, and you can get really... I mean, I'm perfectly happy with the game.

836
00:40:44,641 --> 00:40:47,309
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm competing, so I don't care if someone's better at shit than me.

837
00:40:47,530 --> 00:40:48,035
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

838
00:40:48,055 --> 00:40:48,398
Speaker 0: This is a game.

839
00:40:48,458 --> 00:40:49,427
Speaker 0: If you want to enjoy it...

840
00:40:49,850 --> 00:41:02,647
Speaker 1: It's like this pay-to-win game, and it's like, there is pay-to-win, but it's like, you know, remember when... I always remember Tycho wrote this thing when they talked about Diablo 3, having pay-to-get stuff, and it's like, who are you cheating?

841
00:41:03,108 --> 00:41:03,830
Speaker 1: Satan himself?

842
00:41:05,711 --> 00:41:05,972
Speaker 1: Right?

843
00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:07,801
Speaker 1: Who is the cheated party here?

844
00:41:07,902 --> 00:41:09,650
Speaker 1: The fucking bugs, right?

845
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:15,450
Speaker 0: But for real, I wouldn't recommend playing this game with a bunch of randos, though Scott did, and we'll talk about that.

846
00:41:15,570 --> 00:41:23,430
Speaker 1: So after we played, you know, with Just Us 3 and had a good time, even with our very little... You know, we didn't even scratch the surface and had a great time.

847
00:41:23,830 --> 00:41:27,787
Speaker 0: Yeah, the amount of yelling was like, there was a lot of like, "Go, go, go, Scott,

848
00:41:27,807 --> 00:41:28,148
Speaker 0: recover!".

849
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:37,230
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play this when I get home after I eat, so I played some single player, and the single player was lame, because if you get the difficulty to any reasonable level, you can't do it on your own.

850
00:41:37,310 --> 00:41:37,912
Speaker 1: It's too hard.

851
00:41:37,932 --> 00:41:44,730
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm sure you could get good enough to where you can do it on your own, but godspeed to you if you want to do these things on your own.

852
00:41:45,271 --> 00:41:47,276
Speaker 1: So I said, "Alright, fine, I'll play with random internet

853
00:41:47,316 --> 00:41:47,557
Speaker 1: people.".

854
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:53,130
Speaker 1: So, this is only a sample size of two, but I played two games with random internet people.

855
00:41:53,230 --> 00:42:01,430
Speaker 1: So the first one, it was the stereotypical people who are speaking in Chinese and have way higher level than me, but they also spoke English.

856
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:06,265
Speaker 1: So I'm playing with these people, and they were really good at the game.

857
00:42:06,366 --> 00:42:07,389
Speaker 1: They knew what to do, right?

858
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:13,149
Speaker 1: You know, and I sort of was able to follow along and contribute and help without really bringing anyone down or anything, right?

859
00:42:13,871 --> 00:42:17,200
Speaker 1: And everyone, they were trying to help.

860
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,643
Speaker 1: Everyone was just positive.

861
00:42:18,663 --> 00:42:21,430
Speaker 1: There was not one shitcock at all, right?

862
00:42:21,570 --> 00:42:23,193
Speaker 1: Everything was just A+, let's go.

863
00:42:23,214 --> 00:42:30,328
Speaker 1: The guy has mechs, he brought four mechs with him, and was like, "Four mech stratagems all at once, everyone get a mech, let's

864
00:42:30,368 --> 00:42:30,549
Speaker 1: go.".

865
00:42:31,571 --> 00:42:32,614
Speaker 1: Kind of situation, right?

866
00:42:32,915 --> 00:42:38,109
Speaker 1: And I picked up the recoilless rifle, the guy took the pack, and he's like, "Yeah, I can reload this for you

867
00:42:38,129 --> 00:42:38,270
Speaker 1: here.".

868
00:42:38,370 --> 00:42:43,223
Speaker 1: And then he was so good at reloading it for me, I would shoot a big bad guy with it.

869
00:42:43,584 --> 00:42:46,030
Speaker 1: They all knew that I was doing it and got out of the way.

870
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:47,336
Speaker 1: I didn't have to say, "Hey, get out of the way,

871
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:47,697
Speaker 1: guys.".

872
00:42:47,717 --> 00:42:50,369
Speaker 1: They were always out of the way any time a big bad guy showed up.

873
00:42:50,870 --> 00:42:57,410
Speaker 1: And then, every time I fired it, the next time I pulled it out to reload it in a quiet time, it would already be reloaded.

874
00:42:57,490 --> 00:42:59,036
Speaker 1: I'm like, "When did he reload this

875
00:42:59,076 --> 00:42:59,337
Speaker 1: thing?".

876
00:42:59,959 --> 00:43:00,240
Speaker 1: Right?

877
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:02,790
Speaker 1: He just reloaded it without me even knowing because he's paying attention.

878
00:43:03,572 --> 00:43:05,077
Speaker 1: So I'm like, "Wow, these guys are really

879
00:43:05,117 --> 00:43:05,338
Speaker 1: good.".

880
00:43:06,501 --> 00:43:09,410
Speaker 1: That game eventually ended, played another game with some other people.

881
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,577
Speaker 1: So he was a small bit of trolling.

882
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:15,310
Speaker 1: One guy, all four of his stratagems were mines.

883
00:43:15,730 --> 00:43:17,289
Speaker 0: Oh, mine, mine, mine, mines are dangerous.

884
00:43:17,510 --> 00:43:20,035
Speaker 1: He put the mines everywhere and we kept dying on them.

885
00:43:20,375 --> 00:43:22,279
Speaker 1: But, we kept reviving ourselves.

886
00:43:22,479 --> 00:43:28,750
Speaker 1: Anytime anyone died, everyone, even the mine guy, would throw the reinforcement thing immediately.

887
00:43:29,051 --> 00:43:37,770
Speaker 1: Anytime I would throw the reinforcement thing and I wasn't the last person alive, all the other remaining living players would also throw their reinforcement thing the same time that I threw it.

888
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:41,310
Speaker 1: So if anyone died, it'd be like, "Reinforce it, reinforce it, reinforce

889
00:43:41,330 --> 00:43:41,370
Speaker 1: it.".

890
00:43:41,390 --> 00:43:44,866
Speaker 0: That's actually kind of bad news because then you can't reinforce again for 30, 60, or 90 seconds.

891
00:43:46,411 --> 00:43:50,470
Speaker 1: Well, if you're going to play online with people, you need to upgrade your reinforcement thing to the maximum.

892
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,297
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, because you've read that Etiquette Guide.

893
00:43:52,317 --> 00:43:52,779
Speaker 0: You know what?

894
00:43:53,080 --> 00:43:55,450
Speaker 0: I'm not going to bow before I kill someone with a lightsaber either.

895
00:43:55,650 --> 00:44:04,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, the other thing is once I got to the point where I was able to upgrade my Recoilers Rival to have its own laser sight, I didn't need to use the laser sight perk anymore.

896
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:10,685
Speaker 1: So I was able to instead switch to the priority stratagem perk which makes all my cooldowns faster.

897
00:44:11,648 --> 00:44:12,390
Speaker 1: So that's way good.

898
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:17,620
Speaker 0: But, the game shines most if you find some friends and just play with them.

899
00:44:17,841 --> 00:44:22,070
Speaker 0: Play with your actual friends and ignore all the other people on the internet.

900
00:44:22,251 --> 00:44:25,910
Speaker 1: But I'm telling you, I played with two random internet groups and they were both excellent.

901
00:44:26,110 --> 00:44:32,490
Speaker 1: And in that second group, I already knew at this point how the Recoilers Rival worked with the friend helping you reload.

902
00:44:33,050 --> 00:44:34,174
Speaker 1: I didn't even say anything.

903
00:44:34,355 --> 00:44:35,499
Speaker 1: I just picked up the gun.

904
00:44:35,921 --> 00:44:38,190
Speaker 1: Someone else without me saying anything picked up the supply pack.

905
00:44:38,871 --> 00:44:42,203
Speaker 1: And in that second game with completely different people, same situation.

906
00:44:42,223 --> 00:44:44,070
Speaker 1: It was just always reloaded whenever I looked at it.

907
00:44:44,210 --> 00:44:46,940
Speaker 1: One guy, you can only reload it if I have it out.

908
00:44:47,442 --> 00:44:49,730
Speaker 1: One time I put it away too quickly to get the shotgun out.

909
00:44:50,211 --> 00:44:55,429
Speaker 1: And the guy started stabbing me with his bayonet and I knew what he meant and I pulled the gun out and immediately reloaded it.

910
00:44:55,890 --> 00:44:57,590
Speaker 1: And I was like, alright, these people are like...

911
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:01,189
Speaker 0: It is interesting how little trolling there is and I think it's because...

912
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:05,550
Speaker 1: Well, this is only a sample size of two games and there was a guy dropping mines on everyone.

913
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,446
Speaker 1: There's also a system of commendations and reporting and someone commended me.

914
00:45:10,466 --> 00:45:11,690
Speaker 1: I was like, oh, okay.

915
00:45:12,110 --> 00:45:15,841
Speaker 0: But I did know, I read around like in Reddit and forums.

916
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,790
Speaker 0: I was reading the meta, the people talking about this game.

917
00:45:19,273 --> 00:45:22,390
Speaker 0: And it seems like there is very little trolling in general.

918
00:45:22,691 --> 00:45:23,380
Speaker 1: I think it's because it's 100% co-op.

919
00:45:24,810 --> 00:45:30,089
Speaker 0: You gain nothing by trolling people and they can all just quit and form a new game without you.

920
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,530
Speaker 1: And they can also just report you and not commend you and make a new game.

921
00:45:34,371 --> 00:45:39,766
Speaker 1: The guy who dropped mines everywhere, after the fourth time he did it in a silly way.

922
00:45:39,826 --> 00:45:41,370
Speaker 1: that wasn't helpful, he got kicked.

923
00:45:42,190 --> 00:45:42,850
Speaker 1: And it was like, alright.

924
00:45:43,934 --> 00:45:46,870
Speaker 0: But seriously, buy this game if you want a game like this.

925
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:48,057
Speaker 1: Or wait for a Steam sale.

926
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:49,103
Speaker 1: I don't think it's going anywhere.

927
00:45:49,365 --> 00:45:50,210
Speaker 1: Magic is still around.

928
00:45:50,550 --> 00:45:53,725
Speaker 0: But because of the nature of it, it is kind of repetitive.

929
00:45:53,745 --> 00:45:54,810
Speaker 0: You're going to play it out.

930
00:45:55,350 --> 00:45:59,350
Speaker 1: I'm telling you, it's repetitive because it's deep and there's a lot of stuff to see.

931
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:03,950
Speaker 1: But you see very little new stuff over time so you have to keep playing.

932
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:06,428
Speaker 1: And every mission you'll see a little bit of new stuff.

933
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:09,190
Speaker 0: But eventually you're going to see most of the stuff?

934
00:46:09,230 --> 00:46:10,970
Speaker 1: It's a lot of stuff that comes in in a trickle.

935
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:14,850
Speaker 0: People are saying 40 to 60 hours is about all it's worth if you play hard.

936
00:46:15,130 --> 00:46:15,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about right.

937
00:46:16,613 --> 00:46:17,541
Speaker 1: And 20 bucks for that?

938
00:46:17,561 --> 00:46:18,470
Speaker 1: You don't need to wait for the Steam sale.

939
00:46:18,530 --> 00:46:22,069
Speaker 0: That's why I say it might be worth buying because we're in it right now.

940
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:25,890
Speaker 0: And if you all get into it at the same time, it's going to be way more fun.

941
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:29,709
Speaker 0: Because I'll totally play it with you guys because it is super fun.

942
00:46:31,051 --> 00:46:36,130
Speaker 0: And I can name many of our personal friends who will be specifically into this game.

943
00:46:36,873 --> 00:46:39,970
Speaker 1: And if there is a Steam sale for this, oh man, that is totally worth it.

944
00:46:40,892 --> 00:46:43,470
Speaker 1: So yeah, there's DLCs which is bullshit, but it's pay to win.

945
00:46:43,690 --> 00:46:44,519
Speaker 1: But who are you cheating?

946
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:45,005
Speaker 1: The bugs?

947
00:46:45,790 --> 00:46:50,510
Speaker 0: However, if you join my game and you bought some of that DLC, not going to be a fan.

948
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:51,059
Speaker 1: Why not?

949
00:46:52,711 --> 00:46:58,670
Speaker 0: I feel like those missions with the water would have been a little bit easy if I could just walk over the water.

950
00:46:59,112 --> 00:47:01,030
Speaker 1: That's just one example of a DLC, right?

951
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:03,990
Speaker 0: If they're all that equivalent power, that's a little bit much.

952
00:47:04,150 --> 00:47:05,830
Speaker 1: I don't know, but let's say I bought a stratagem.

953
00:47:06,150 --> 00:47:08,568
Speaker 1: I could drop it and you can use it even though I bought it.

954
00:47:08,811 --> 00:47:09,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, right?

955
00:47:09,811 --> 00:47:12,290
Speaker 1: There's also a lot of the DLCs are cosmetic, right?

956
00:47:12,350 --> 00:47:16,650
Speaker 1: But I mean, yeah, it's bullshit because it's $40 to get the mega DLC pack plus the game.

957
00:47:16,911 --> 00:47:18,345
Speaker 1: It's $20 to get the game with no DLCs.

958
00:47:20,111 --> 00:47:27,319
Speaker 1: If there is, however, one day, if they had a deal like $10 to get every DLC to finish off, I'd be like, "Oh, maybe.

959
00:47:27,641 --> 00:47:28,709
Speaker 1: See how much I'm still playing

960
00:47:28,729 --> 00:47:28,770
Speaker 1: it.".

961
00:47:29,912 --> 00:47:32,190
Speaker 1: Because it would just add so much more freshness to the game.

962
00:47:32,571 --> 00:47:35,662
Speaker 1: Every time you mix up, you can get more gameplay out of it.

963
00:47:35,722 --> 00:47:37,710
Speaker 1: if you mix up which things you're using.

964
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:50,370
Speaker 1: If I move away from my recoilless rifle strategy and decide I'm going to play more jump boots and laser cannon strategy, suddenly it's like a different game because you play so differently.

965
00:47:52,910 --> 00:47:53,486
Speaker 1: Play this game with us.

966
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:53,965
Speaker 0: Yeah.

967
00:48:00,171 --> 00:48:02,310
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

968
00:48:02,490 --> 00:48:07,430
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

970
00:48:13,112 --> 00:48:15,770
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

971
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:20,510
Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

973

Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

974
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:31,470
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

975
00:48:51,131 --> 00:49:35,290
Speaker 0: And the Patrons for this episode of Geek Nights in order of the amount of money they give us are Nicholas Brando, Rebecca Dunn, John R. Knobs II, Amanda Duchette, James David White, Christian Koontz, Jess, Sam Cordery, Mechanical Mind, William Eisenrose, You expected the next name to be yours, but it was me, Dio, Clinton Walton, MyStady.com, Phil Ulrich, Renee from New Zealand, Robert Lee, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Rare Lavelle, Brian Cedroni, Rochelle Montanona, Finn Eric Solvarod, Rochelle Montanona again, Kinetic Man, Aaron Cerise, Chris Midkiff, Chris Knox, he was a dark and stormy night, Daniel Redman, Chris Haddad, Doug Schneider, Sean Klein, Chris Reimer, and Thomas Hahn.

976
00:49:36,712 --> 00:49:39,724
Speaker 0: I was tripped up by the two Rochelle Montanonas in there.

977
00:49:39,784 --> 00:49:41,210
Speaker 0: That caused me a moment of delay.

978
00:49:41,670 --> 00:49:45,970
Speaker 0: Also, I'm speaking to you very close to the microphone in a perhaps smooth radio voice.

979
00:49:46,732 --> 00:49:54,250
Speaker 0: As you probably saw, the Utena episode is finally up, and we actually have two recorded, so I'm working on the editing of the second one already.

980
00:49:54,730 --> 00:50:00,910
Speaker 0: But that won't go up until I get the two panels we have left, possibly three from PAX South that have to get on the channel.

981
00:50:01,290 --> 00:50:09,570
Speaker 0: However, everything will be on hold until next week, because we are leaving for MAGFest early Thursday morning, where as you saw, we have six panels.

982
00:50:09,991 --> 00:50:18,550
Speaker 0: So, if you are listening to this still, the post-credits stinger, the Patreon extra content, then be sure to come by and say hi at MAGFest.

983
00:50:18,910 --> 00:50:24,690
Speaker 0: We're not joking, we're going to be playing DDR at like three or four in the morning at least one night, and it's going to be amazing.

984
00:50:25,330 --> 00:50:28,450
Speaker 0: And now I leave you with something kinda weird.

985
00:50:28,850 --> 00:50:38,930
Speaker 1: Good shit, good shit, that's some good shit right there, right there, if I do say so myself, I say so, that's what I'm talking about, right there, right there, right there.

986
00:50:39,656 --> 00:50:40,241
Speaker 0: Woo!

987
00:50:40,383 --> 00:50:41,069
Speaker 0: Good shit!
