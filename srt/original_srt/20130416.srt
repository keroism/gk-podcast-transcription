1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:10,748
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, April 16th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,748 --> 00:00:11,771
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:13,315
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,355 --> 00:00:14,718
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:17,966
Speaker 1: Tonight we're talking about games that only Scott could love.

6
00:00:17,986 --> 00:00:20,172
Speaker 0: No, I do.

7
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:21,575
Speaker 0: Not could.

8
00:00:22,537 --> 00:00:23,559
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

9
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:29,431
Speaker 1: Sort of a call back to back when we did a similar show about Arrow Biz.

10
00:00:29,832 --> 00:00:33,846
Speaker 0: I was searching for like, "Have we done a show on

11
00:00:33,886 --> 00:00:34,047
Speaker 0: this?".

12
00:00:34,087 --> 00:00:38,546
Speaker 0: And I saw an episode from 2008 called, you know, "Games Only Rym

13
00:00:38,607 --> 00:00:38,908
Speaker 0: Likes.".

14
00:00:39,069 --> 00:00:41,259
Speaker 0: So I was like, "Hey, can we do Games Only Scott

15
00:00:41,279 --> 00:00:41,520
Speaker 0: Likes?".

16
00:00:41,982 --> 00:00:43,207
Speaker 1: And I was like, "What, like Kings

17
00:00:43,267 --> 00:00:43,629
Speaker 1: Bounty?"?

18
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,572
Speaker 0: I could hardly think of any games that only Scott likes, but then I thought of a whole bunch.

19
00:00:48,874 --> 00:00:52,635
Speaker 1: One of them's got to be Kings Bounty because he tried to get me to play that like four times.

20
00:00:52,776 --> 00:00:55,287
Speaker 0: I don't know why I don't like Kings Bounty.

21
00:00:55,367 --> 00:00:59,302
Speaker 1: I didn't get it and it wasn't fun and my character on the horse was way too big.

22
00:00:59,322 --> 00:01:01,127
Speaker 1: Anyway.

23
00:01:01,328 --> 00:01:02,130
Speaker 0: That bothered me.

24
00:01:02,150 --> 00:01:05,319
Speaker 1: It's good to be back on our normal schedule.

25
00:01:05,339 --> 00:01:07,954
Speaker 1: I've been biking to work now that it's nice out and I don't have the flu.

26
00:01:07,974 --> 00:01:08,900
Speaker 0: It's still too cold.

27
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:10,969
Speaker 0: I don't know what the fuck is wrong with you.

28
00:01:10,989 --> 00:01:18,356
Speaker 0: If you check the weather, basically it's alternating between sunny and beautiful but cold and warm and awesome but rainy.

29
00:01:18,396 --> 00:01:22,773
Speaker 0: There has not been a sunny and warm- Scott, it is 60 degrees out right now.

30
00:01:22,853 --> 00:01:23,456
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

31
00:01:23,556 --> 00:01:23,958
Speaker 0: Yes.

32
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:26,470
Speaker 0: And what temperature was it when I woke up this morning?

33
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:27,837
Speaker 1: I don't know when you wake up.

34
00:01:28,017 --> 00:01:29,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, like 40 something.

35
00:01:29,926 --> 00:01:31,612
Speaker 1: No, because I biked to work this morning.

36
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:32,195
Speaker 1: It was not 40.

37
00:01:32,195 --> 00:01:33,901
Speaker 1: It was 40 like 89.

38
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:39,537
Speaker 1: I biked to work at exactly 830 because I was running about a half hour late.

39
00:01:40,199 --> 00:01:40,801
Speaker 0: It was cold.

40
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:47,115
Speaker 1: And right now, right now, which is a while after I got home, it's 59 degrees.

41
00:01:47,136 --> 00:01:49,140
Speaker 1: That's cold.

42
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:49,944
Speaker 1: Which is pleasant.

43
00:01:50,064 --> 00:01:50,366
Speaker 0: Cold.

44
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:52,817
Speaker 1: For biking, in fact, that's a little warm.

45
00:01:52,877 --> 00:01:53,138
Speaker 1: No.

46
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:57,553
Speaker 0: Call me when it's like 68, 69 at least.

47
00:01:57,834 --> 00:01:58,817
Speaker 1: We'll have to do our race.

48
00:01:58,857 --> 00:02:02,269
Speaker 0: When you're biking, there is a fan blowing on your entire body.

49
00:02:02,289 --> 00:02:02,670
Speaker 0: You know what?

50
00:02:02,711 --> 00:02:10,663
Speaker 1: When I'm biking, it is so hot that even on a day like today, I'm in shorts and a t-shirt trying to pull my shirt off because I'm so hot.

51
00:02:10,803 --> 00:02:11,948
Speaker 0: That does not happen to me.

52
00:02:11,969 --> 00:02:13,556
Speaker 1: I don't think you bike as hard as I do.

53
00:02:14,299 --> 00:02:16,991
Speaker 1: We should do our race to Rockaway once it's warm.

54
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:18,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone's looking up.

55
00:02:18,257 --> 00:02:23,940
Speaker 0: Apparently the beach is going to open irregularly, but some sections of the boardwalk will be closed because broken.

56
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:29,762
Speaker 1: I kind of have this perverse, selfish hope that as a result, a lot of people don't go to the beach.

57
00:02:29,842 --> 00:02:32,433
Speaker 1: So when I do bike to the beach, I have a private beach.

58
00:02:33,357 --> 00:02:36,231
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's hard to bike to the beach when part of the boardwalk is closed.

59
00:02:36,412 --> 00:02:38,120
Speaker 0: We'll have to bike on the non-boardwalk.

60
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,719
Speaker 1: I kind of know my way around the island at this point because I bike over there.

61
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:41,301
Speaker 0: I mean, I know.

62
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:43,309
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like you can't bike on the sand.

63
00:02:43,951 --> 00:02:46,905
Speaker 0: So if you want to bike straight from one end to the other.

64
00:02:46,926 --> 00:02:48,780
Speaker 1: There's a road that goes mostly parallel to the boardwalk.

65
00:02:48,920 --> 00:03:00,065
Speaker 0: You have to use that road is what I'm saying as opposed to using the boardwalk, which is much nicer and closer to the water and with a better view and such, you know, under the boardwalk.

66
00:03:00,085 --> 00:03:00,226
Speaker 0: Okay.

67
00:03:01,149 --> 00:03:01,450
Speaker 1: All right.

68
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:07,735
Speaker 1: So in the news, it's been a while since we've really talked about current events and everything and there's not a lot of them.

69
00:03:07,936 --> 00:03:08,740
Speaker 1: There's stuff coming.

70
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:15,071
Speaker 1: I mean, Monica was getting this real release and all that, but uh, an issue that has come up from multiple different places.

71
00:03:15,091 --> 00:03:21,278
Speaker 1: So I kind of want to talk about the issue as opposed to all the specific people except Adam, because I have to talk about him.

72
00:03:21,318 --> 00:03:28,105
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, I don't want to talk about it, but the general sentiment is that multiple people like the head of Ubisoft also said something very similar.

73
00:03:28,686 --> 00:03:39,072
Speaker 1: People are ready for and or okay with always on DRM being part of their console gaming experience, not just their PC gaming experience.

74
00:03:39,092 --> 00:03:49,891
Speaker 0: Well, you know, despite the fact that online gamers on Reddit and other places yell and scream saying all online DRM blah, blah, blah.

75
00:03:49,911 --> 00:03:50,795
Speaker 0: They buy the game anyway.

76
00:03:50,815 --> 00:03:51,740
Speaker 0: They buy the game anyway.

77
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,710
Speaker 0: Sim city as much as catastrophe is yelling.

78
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:55,433
Speaker 0: I didn't buy it.

79
00:03:55,473 --> 00:03:56,175
Speaker 1: I'm boycotting it.

80
00:03:56,918 --> 00:03:58,826
Speaker 0: I haven't bought an EA game in forever.

81
00:03:59,007 --> 00:04:01,296
Speaker 1: I'm actually as much of a gamer as I am.

82
00:04:01,397 --> 00:04:04,994
Speaker 1: I'm ideologically opposed to buying EA games, specifically SimCity.

83
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:08,291
Speaker 0: I wouldn't buy them just cause I don't want to play any of their games regardless of the online.

84
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:11,646
Speaker 1: I would want to play SimCity, but I refuse on principle.

85
00:04:11,787 --> 00:04:14,657
Speaker 0: My interest in playing it is, is mild, but very mild.

86
00:04:14,697 --> 00:04:20,276
Speaker 0: My interest came back cause I have a copy of SimCity for you can buy some city 2000 on gog.com.

87
00:04:20,296 --> 00:04:22,323
Speaker 1: Some city 2000.

88
00:04:22,323 --> 00:04:23,427
Speaker 1: I'm done with you suck.

89
00:04:23,507 --> 00:04:24,471
Speaker 1: I've played that game out.

90
00:04:24,752 --> 00:04:25,013
Speaker 1: Okay.

91
00:04:25,213 --> 00:04:31,174
Speaker 1: I've taken a city legit from nothing to all perfect arcologies and a flat grid.

92
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:33,361
Speaker 1: So I have no interest in playing that game.

93
00:04:33,562 --> 00:04:40,042
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is that, Oh, and two fusion plants, maybe three in case is a disaster.

94
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:42,068
Speaker 0: You put them in separate places.

95
00:04:42,128 --> 00:04:50,637
Speaker 0: It just, the point is, is that despite this SimCity still sold like a jillion copies and they still made a jillion dollars.

96
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:51,921
Speaker 1: But why is that?

97
00:04:51,961 --> 00:05:03,423
Speaker 0: And I would argue that is because PCs are pretty useless without being connected to the, remember we, for how many years we had PCs that didn't have any internet and we use them all day.

98
00:05:03,443 --> 00:05:05,229
Speaker 0: I wrote documents for school in Microsoft works.

99
00:05:09,801 --> 00:05:12,311
Speaker 0: And I played Jez ball and wasn't it the greatest.

100
00:05:12,692 --> 00:05:13,234
Speaker 1: It was okay.

101
00:05:13,435 --> 00:05:18,497
Speaker 1: But actually, no, even in those days I had no modems and I was playing games and fucking around with terminals.

102
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:19,180
Speaker 0: Right?

103
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:22,956
Speaker 0: So if you have a computer in your house that always has internet, right?

104
00:05:23,076 --> 00:05:23,900
Speaker 0: So much, right?

105
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,834
Speaker 0: Then why wouldn't you have a console in your house?

106
00:05:26,854 --> 00:05:27,457
Speaker 0: that always isn't it?

107
00:05:27,477 --> 00:05:27,980
Speaker 0: What's the difference?

108
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:34,842
Speaker 1: Well, I think the difference is that one consoles still to me are the kind of thing that they're supposed to be.

109
00:05:34,962 --> 00:05:36,809
Speaker 1: Literally the physical boxes.

110
00:05:36,829 --> 00:05:38,334
Speaker 1: here, I turn it on, games happen.

111
00:05:39,037 --> 00:05:49,052
Speaker 1: So if it has to be always on for stuff to work, even single player games, suddenly taking your console to your beach house doesn't work out so well.

112
00:05:49,353 --> 00:05:49,554
Speaker 1: Yeah.

113
00:05:49,594 --> 00:05:53,309
Speaker 1: Even the console at grandma's house doesn't work out so well.

114
00:05:53,831 --> 00:05:54,051
Speaker 0: Yeah.

115
00:05:54,092 --> 00:06:00,080
Speaker 0: Really what this is about is, you know, people seem to be making this thing like, Oh my God, no one will be able to play games.

116
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,045
Speaker 0: that was always online.

117
00:06:01,105 --> 00:06:05,624
Speaker 0: And yeah, internet's unreliable in a lot of places, but actually in most places it works.

118
00:06:05,664 --> 00:06:14,392
Speaker 0: The real worries here are number one, I looked up some statistics and basically 70 to 80% of X boxes are online.

119
00:06:14,412 --> 00:06:15,877
Speaker 0: So they're throwing away 25% of customers.

120
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:22,143
Speaker 0: So really one out of every four people has an X box now will not be able to use the new X boxes.

121
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:29,070
Speaker 0: They don't have it on the internet because maybe they don't have good internet or they don't know how to plug in more than one device.

122
00:06:29,752 --> 00:06:30,454
Speaker 1: problem.

123
00:06:30,474 --> 00:06:30,815
Speaker 1: Yeah.

124
00:06:31,858 --> 00:06:34,590
Speaker 0: I saw screenshots from a guy who still had the original X box, three 60.

125
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:37,743
Speaker 0: It didn't red ring and it had the original software.

126
00:06:37,763 --> 00:06:39,147
Speaker 0: Nice with the blades.

127
00:06:39,428 --> 00:06:40,532
Speaker 0: They go, wow.

128
00:06:41,374 --> 00:06:41,996
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah.

129
00:06:42,056 --> 00:06:42,618
Speaker 0: Crazy stuff.

130
00:06:42,678 --> 00:06:56,989
Speaker 1: But it's kind of, it's like they're trying to take some of the worst or at least useless aspects of PC gaming and poured it into a console, but for no good reason, the reason they want to sell more ads, right?

131
00:06:57,049 --> 00:06:59,439
Speaker 0: They want to, they want to forget the real reasons.

132
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:00,483
Speaker 1: Cause we know the real reasons.

133
00:07:00,744 --> 00:07:04,238
Speaker 1: The reasons they give are such hollow bullshit reasons.

134
00:07:04,318 --> 00:07:05,624
Speaker 0: They don't have a real reason.

135
00:07:05,784 --> 00:07:08,174
Speaker 1: We want a solid interconnected experience.

136
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,720
Speaker 1: We want the social aspects, right?

137
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,725
Speaker 0: Because they don't have.

138
00:07:10,785 --> 00:07:13,660
Speaker 0: the only reasons they have are the bullshit reasons that are evil.

139
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:16,935
Speaker 0: They don't have one single good reason that is good for the customer.

140
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:18,822
Speaker 1: You know, I have the game Mark of the Ninja.

141
00:07:18,842 --> 00:07:21,811
Speaker 1: I've been playing it on my steam console because why would I?

142
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:33,773
Speaker 1: there was literally no reason it would ever need to connect to the internet because it's a single player game I'm playing through by myself.

143
00:07:33,813 --> 00:07:42,147
Speaker 1: There might be benefits to connecting it to the internet, like sharing scores with your friends, but one, those shouldn't prevent me from just playing a fucking game.

144
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:42,670
Speaker 0: Exactly.

145
00:07:42,690 --> 00:07:44,738
Speaker 1: I don't even have another one.

146
00:07:44,758 --> 00:07:45,019
Speaker 1: That's it.

147
00:07:45,501 --> 00:08:01,513
Speaker 1: That's the highest order concern that they're doing it for these selfish, semi secret, but obvious reasons like trying to do DRM, trying to force social aspects that are used to guilt people into DLC or even having DLC available and

148
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:06,956
Speaker 0: tracking people's playing so that they can get data about you and you and what you play and how many hours you play.

149
00:08:06,996 --> 00:08:09,989
Speaker 1: This is the social crap of Scott got.

150
00:08:10,029 --> 00:08:12,479
Speaker 1: this achievement will remind people to play games.

151
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:20,019
Speaker 1: They're trying to have this ability to have their hand in your console, right in the cookie jar, pushing your buttons and getting you to go in the direction they want you to go.

152
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:22,189
Speaker 1: And I think it works.

153
00:08:22,209 --> 00:08:24,217
Speaker 0: Statistically, it works on most people.

154
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:25,684
Speaker 0: So they think they're going to make more money.

155
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:35,582
Speaker 0: They think they're gonna make more money if they throw away one in four customers completely and milk the customers, the other 75% for more dollars each in the midterm.

156
00:08:35,945 --> 00:08:40,085
Speaker 1: They probably will because the people they're throwing away are the people who've never heard of DLC.

157
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:44,946
Speaker 0: They'll also probably get those, you know, even with the customer service expense, right?

158
00:08:45,106 --> 00:08:48,200
Speaker 0: Get some of that 25% to plug their computer into the internets.

159
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:48,582
Speaker 1: Yep.

160
00:08:49,004 --> 00:08:50,954
Speaker 1: And they're also going to be able to really push this stuff.

161
00:08:50,974 --> 00:08:55,173
Speaker 1: I mean, look at this recent push toward making it impossible.

162
00:08:55,193 --> 00:09:10,570
Speaker 1: You know, one thing online here I'm is used for is to prevent people from modding their own game or cheating in the single player game that they have because they're they want to push these microtransactions or upgrades or DLC or comparative scores online.

163
00:09:11,171 --> 00:09:14,000
Speaker 1: And as a result, they need to prevent you from cheating.

164
00:09:14,121 --> 00:09:19,221
Speaker 1: But if I want to cheat on a game that I own, that I'm playing by myself, I should be able to cheat.

165
00:09:19,522 --> 00:09:19,703
Speaker 0: Yeah.

166
00:09:19,763 --> 00:09:30,815
Speaker 0: If a game is offline completely, I can get a tool easily to modify the data in Civ two on the options and turned cheating to on if you wanted to cheat.

167
00:09:30,835 --> 00:09:31,497
Speaker 1: Yep.

168
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:33,202
Speaker 1: It's like, you know what?

169
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:33,966
Speaker 1: I'm done with this.

170
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:36,840
Speaker 1: Let's spot a thousand nukes and make China not exist.

171
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:41,694
Speaker 0: There's no way to make me, you know, pay money for donuts in, you know, Simpsons.

172
00:09:41,714 --> 00:09:45,952
Speaker 0: That's you just go onto the hard drive, find the file.

173
00:09:45,972 --> 00:09:47,983
Speaker 0: This is how many donuts you have and change the number.

174
00:09:48,123 --> 00:09:52,178
Speaker 1: Their end game is to make you pay money to have that cheat menu.

175
00:09:52,499 --> 00:09:58,278
Speaker 1: Their end game is to turn Borderlands into will basically already is an MMO.

176
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:04,227
Speaker 1: They don't let you just pick your level because they need you to go through the grind bullshit for all the social aspects they had and the DLC.

177
00:10:04,247 --> 00:10:04,970
Speaker 1: They've got all these.

178
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:10,747
Speaker 1: It's all centered around monetizing more while making less.

179
00:10:10,767 --> 00:10:11,509
Speaker 0: All right.

180
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:21,203
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Adam Arth, this Microsoft guy, basically from what I can tell, right, is that he, I don't know if he truly believes that he was saying or not.

181
00:10:21,545 --> 00:10:27,669
Speaker 0: It seemed like he was sort of having a trollish sort of jerky argument battle with his friend, right?

182
00:10:27,971 --> 00:10:33,656
Speaker 0: Like if you look at the actual tweets, it's sort of like two guys ragging at each other, like, you know, deal with it, man.

183
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:34,841
Speaker 0: You know, that sort of thing.

184
00:10:34,881 --> 00:10:36,186
Speaker 0: Like how serious was he?

185
00:10:36,206 --> 00:10:38,415
Speaker 0: Not, you know, maybe he did believe it.

186
00:10:38,997 --> 00:10:46,609
Speaker 0: Um, but you know, the way he was expressing himself was way jerky because I think he saw it as a one on one sort of friend troll battle.

187
00:10:46,789 --> 00:10:47,030
Speaker 0: Right.

188
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,746
Speaker 0: Uh, but in reality he ended up being a jerk to everyone who doesn't have internets.

189
00:10:52,469 --> 00:10:57,250
Speaker 0: And so then he lost his job either by quitting or resigning or who knows, but it doesn't work there anymore.

190
00:10:57,270 --> 00:10:57,733
Speaker 0: Yep.

191
00:10:58,376 --> 00:11:02,409
Speaker 1: But his sentiment was basically everything I rail against.

192
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,011
Speaker 0: Yes.

193
00:11:03,392 --> 00:11:14,064
Speaker 1: So not super sympathetic toward him because this whole DLC thing is, and microtransactions are really starting to encroach into areas they shouldn't be in gaming.

194
00:11:14,847 --> 00:11:15,910
Speaker 0: Oh, that's how it is.

195
00:11:16,111 --> 00:11:20,147
Speaker 1: Now what's funny is PCs, which my PC is always online no matter what.

196
00:11:20,187 --> 00:11:27,933
Speaker 1: In fact, even if I lose power, I'll probably still have internet on my PC between ups and files and all that stuff.

197
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:36,203
Speaker 1: But even then I can mod my games and fuck around with my games and PCs are the place where you have the freedom to fuck around.

198
00:11:36,223 --> 00:11:38,875
Speaker 1: The console is the place where you just plug it in and it just works.

199
00:11:39,679 --> 00:11:42,472
Speaker 1: People who complain about PC gaming complain that it doesn't just work.

200
00:11:43,155 --> 00:11:47,434
Speaker 1: If your console doesn't just work, suddenly those people are going to be really mad.

201
00:11:47,574 --> 00:11:47,775
Speaker 0: Yeah.

202
00:11:47,815 --> 00:11:54,104
Speaker 0: People talk about like, you know, this sort of thing where PC gamers think they're so much better than console gamers.

203
00:11:54,124 --> 00:11:55,311
Speaker 1: We are, but that's a separate discussion.

204
00:11:55,653 --> 00:12:02,441
Speaker 0: And no, I'm going to say, look, you know, and they, and they sort of try to portray the PC gamer as like an elitist jerk, right?

205
00:12:02,923 --> 00:12:04,489
Speaker 0: And console gamers, right?

206
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:11,339
Speaker 0: They try to say, you know, we're not, you know, you know, dumb or stupid or bad because we play, you know, on a console instead of a PC.

207
00:12:11,379 --> 00:12:21,844
Speaker 0: It's like the guy who's living in Disneyland, even though most people, even though most people who are actually defined themselves as gamers and care about video games deeply are playing games on both all the time.

208
00:12:21,864 --> 00:12:22,265
Speaker 0: Yeah.

209
00:12:23,168 --> 00:12:36,199
Speaker 0: Uh, but the thing is, is that yes, if you are one of those people who is saying, you know, PC games suck because look at all these errors, you are not as good as the PC gamers who are smart enough to get games to work on a PC.

210
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:41,520
Speaker 0: If you're not smart enough to game games to work on a PC, you are definitively less smart.

211
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:46,101
Speaker 0: At least when it comes to computers as those PC gamers, therefore you are not as good as them.

212
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:49,556
Speaker 0: They are better than you empirically to make a lie.

213
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:51,686
Speaker 0: If you're complaining that it's like, Oh, it's too hard.

214
00:12:51,726 --> 00:12:51,987
Speaker 0: Yeah.

215
00:12:52,289 --> 00:12:55,684
Speaker 0: Cause you're not as smart as they are to make less acidic point.

216
00:12:55,845 --> 00:12:57,695
Speaker 0: No, I got to be as acidic as possible.

217
00:12:57,715 --> 00:12:58,841
Speaker 1: I just want to make a less acidic point.

218
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,824
Speaker 1: I'm gonna be a little bit basic here.

219
00:13:00,185 --> 00:13:01,771
Speaker 0: Max acid a hundred molar.

220
00:13:02,212 --> 00:13:04,400
Speaker 1: My argument is simpler.

221
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:11,845
Speaker 1: As soon as they keep doing this stuff to consoles, consoles are going to have all the same problems that PC gaming has.

222
00:13:11,946 --> 00:13:12,468
Speaker 1: Then what?

223
00:13:13,211 --> 00:13:20,079
Speaker 1: As soon as you're, you're trying to play your game on your Xbox and it's like blah, blah, blah, DRM, something, something, and the game stops.

224
00:13:21,481 --> 00:13:27,006
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, the real problem here is not so much that your internet will not be out, will be out, right?

225
00:13:27,187 --> 00:13:30,464
Speaker 0: Because you're not even gonna have the console if you don't have internet and that's super reliable.

226
00:13:30,765 --> 00:13:34,396
Speaker 0: It's that the Xbox system will go down, right?

227
00:13:34,838 --> 00:13:36,284
Speaker 0: Microsoft will have an outage.

228
00:13:36,385 --> 00:13:39,180
Speaker 0: And right now, if Microsoft has an outage, it means live doesn't work.

229
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:41,991
Speaker 0: So you can't chat or play online, but you can still play.

230
00:13:42,172 --> 00:13:47,395
Speaker 1: My Atari and regular Nintendo still work and I can put those cartridges in and play them.

231
00:13:47,415 --> 00:13:54,222
Speaker 0: But with the new system, if it's always online, if Microsoft has an outage, no one can play, even no matter how smart they are.

232
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:56,370
Speaker 1: But, but rim and Scott steam and you know what?

233
00:13:56,792 --> 00:14:04,295
Speaker 1: Steam valve is one of the few companies in the entire world I actually trust to some degree.

234
00:14:04,716 --> 00:14:08,509
Speaker 0: It also has offline mode and steam, which works really well.

235
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,272
Speaker 0: Yeah.

236
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:10,857
Speaker 1: I mean, simply works.

237
00:14:11,219 --> 00:14:11,580
Speaker 1: You know what?

238
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:20,534
Speaker 1: If I was going to play the new Sim city, 99% of the time I would play it sitting in airports or sitting on planes where there's internet sometimes.

239
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:21,076
Speaker 0: Yeah.

240
00:14:21,096 --> 00:14:25,230
Speaker 1: I'm not going to pay for airport unreliable internet and a lot of airports have free wifi.

241
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:28,159
Speaker 1: Not outside of the U S I have.

242
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:47,111
Speaker 1: So increasingly when I travel, you get to an airport and there'll be a bunch of free access points and you can get free internet, but you have to send a text from a local number and then register and then they text you back credentials and then you can log on because a lot of these countries have laws against anonymous access to the internet.

243
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:51,407
Speaker 0: Those non free speech countries.

244
00:14:51,468 --> 00:14:51,649
Speaker 0: Yeah.

245
00:14:51,749 --> 00:14:54,160
Speaker 1: And Google voice does not often handle those that well.

246
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,154
Speaker 1: And a lot of countries seem to block Google voice texts for that purpose.

247
00:14:57,315 --> 00:14:58,119
Speaker 0: Can't VPN.

248
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,266
Speaker 0: once you get connected, I can't get connected.

249
00:15:01,551 --> 00:15:02,755
Speaker 1: Oh, that's the problem.

250
00:15:03,497 --> 00:15:09,103
Speaker 0: Well, can't you do their bullshit registration to get connected with like a pay phone and then not send a text from pay phone.

251
00:15:10,488 --> 00:15:10,810
Speaker 0: Uh, yes.

252
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:13,721
Speaker 0: Some of them, other countries have a lot fancier pay phones than we do.

253
00:15:14,103 --> 00:15:16,955
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, they're still disappearing outside of Japan.

254
00:15:16,975 --> 00:15:18,180
Speaker 1: I have not seen a pay phone.

255
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:18,522
Speaker 1: that was.

256
00:15:18,803 --> 00:15:24,068
Speaker 1: in fact, the pay phones I've seen in my travels were less sophisticated than the ones that I still see in the U S.

257
00:15:24,209 --> 00:15:24,531
Speaker 0: oh really?

258
00:15:24,551 --> 00:15:27,988
Speaker 0: Cause when I was in Israel in the year 2000, the pay phones are very sophisticated.

259
00:15:28,008 --> 00:15:30,923
Speaker 0: You would put calling cards and credit cards directly into them.

260
00:15:31,144 --> 00:15:36,834
Speaker 0: They had digital screens that showed you like who you were calling and the rate would take up and the time would go down and all that kind of stuff.

261
00:15:37,156 --> 00:15:37,739
Speaker 0: And that was then.

262
00:15:38,201 --> 00:15:44,481
Speaker 1: that has not been my experience in India, Turkey, Germany, okay, et cetera, Sao Paulo, Israel.

263
00:15:44,521 --> 00:15:45,967
Speaker 0: best phones, question mark.

264
00:15:46,368 --> 00:15:48,858
Speaker 1: Well, I have a better question for you.

265
00:15:48,938 --> 00:15:50,042
Speaker 1: The fuck's a pay phone.

266
00:15:50,343 --> 00:15:50,865
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

267
00:15:51,928 --> 00:15:52,490
Speaker 0: In an airport.

268
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:57,528
Speaker 1: The other case, the actual flight, I'm flying to Australia in a couple of months.

269
00:15:57,809 --> 00:16:00,623
Speaker 1: I w I would play sim city cause that's the perfect game.

270
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:01,688
Speaker 1: Dick around on a plane.

271
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:04,482
Speaker 1: I'm probably not going to have internet on that 25 hour flight.

272
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:04,724
Speaker 0: Yeah.

273
00:16:04,784 --> 00:16:04,965
Speaker 0: What?

274
00:16:05,086 --> 00:16:09,233
Speaker 0: I mean, even if you could, even if the plane had internet, you think it's going to have internet in the middle of the Pacific ocean.

275
00:16:09,736 --> 00:16:10,843
Speaker 1: If it did, that'd be pretty awesome.

276
00:16:10,863 --> 00:16:11,928
Speaker 0: You know, how would that work?

277
00:16:12,230 --> 00:16:19,103
Speaker 1: So I can't play sim city, so I'm not going to buy it, but maybe if I can come up with a way to pirate it, then I could play it on my laptop.

278
00:16:19,223 --> 00:16:19,544
Speaker 1: Maybe.

279
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:19,926
Speaker 1: Huh?

280
00:16:20,126 --> 00:16:20,347
Speaker 1: Huh?

281
00:16:20,568 --> 00:16:20,889
Speaker 1: Huh?

282
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,311
Speaker 0: All right.

283
00:16:21,331 --> 00:16:21,913
Speaker 0: That's enough of that.

284
00:16:22,837 --> 00:16:25,166
Speaker 0: Uh, so I just got a tiny news, tiny news.

285
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:25,468
Speaker 0: Yeah.

286
00:16:25,508 --> 00:16:39,664
Speaker 0: You know, there's been trend lately of remaking the classics and I think a certain segment of the game industry has realized, Hey, it's really low effort to take these old hit games, keep pretty much everything intact and update graphics and will sells.

287
00:16:39,764 --> 00:16:42,256
Speaker 0: I think bionic commander rearmed was the trigger for this.

288
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,020
Speaker 1: I think it was too.

289
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,146
Speaker 0: I mean, you got the duck tail.

290
00:16:44,226 --> 00:16:48,108
Speaker 1: I can't, I still kind of can't believe the duck tails thing happened cause that came out of nowhere.

291
00:16:48,128 --> 00:16:51,526
Speaker 0: So cap comments, Sega are really the big ones doing this the most, right?

292
00:16:51,546 --> 00:16:52,330
Speaker 0: I mean, right.

293
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:53,778
Speaker 0: So bionic command, it was cap com.

294
00:16:53,818 --> 00:16:55,605
Speaker 0: mega man nine 10 is cap com.

295
00:16:55,926 --> 00:16:57,170
Speaker 0: Ducktales is cap com.

296
00:16:57,491 --> 00:16:58,695
Speaker 0: Sega did Sonic four.

297
00:16:58,715 --> 00:16:59,136
Speaker 0: Right.

298
00:16:59,537 --> 00:17:04,779
Speaker 1: I'm still amazed though that as good as bionic commander rearmed was how bad the new bionic commando.

299
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:05,541
Speaker 0: Well, forget that.

300
00:17:05,983 --> 00:17:07,508
Speaker 0: So Sega is doing another one.

301
00:17:07,729 --> 00:17:08,230
Speaker 0: They're re.

302
00:17:08,351 --> 00:17:13,528
Speaker 0: they're re releasing Sega Genesis, Mickey mouse, castle of illusion.

303
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,550
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

304
00:17:14,873 --> 00:17:15,695
Speaker 0: That was a good game.

305
00:17:15,756 --> 00:17:16,479
Speaker 0: It was right.

306
00:17:16,499 --> 00:17:22,564
Speaker 0: So they're pretty much taking all these games that are really easy to remake, updating dem graphics and re releasing them.

307
00:17:23,106 --> 00:17:24,108
Speaker 0: So there you go.

308
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:29,467
Speaker 1: So speaking of updates to old games, not really, but it's in the, it's in a similar spirit.

309
00:17:29,487 --> 00:17:30,271
Speaker 1: just very briefly.

310
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:34,910
Speaker 1: So Luke crane and toward been working for a while on a game.

311
00:17:34,991 --> 00:17:40,031
Speaker 1: They had a working title for it, dungeoneers and dragon slayers D's and D's, but that has a little legal implications.

312
00:17:40,051 --> 00:17:46,357
Speaker 1: I mean, I have a, my company had a working title of a project called F1 or formula one.

313
00:17:46,377 --> 00:17:46,960
Speaker 0: That's not going to work.

314
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:48,952
Speaker 1: That's just what we called it while we were working on it.

315
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:50,601
Speaker 1: I'm not, yeah, there's trouble with that.

316
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:51,464
Speaker 1: Obviously.

317
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:57,681
Speaker 1: So, uh, D's and D's was a sort of callback to old school dungeon crawls.

318
00:17:58,023 --> 00:18:01,014
Speaker 0: It was also sort of a modification of mouse guard.

319
00:18:01,034 --> 00:18:10,636
Speaker 0: It was like mouse guard with a lot of the mouse, all the mousey stuff ripped off and just dungeons, but they would run a play test of this at like burning cons and nerd NYC things.

320
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:14,311
Speaker 1: And I played it a bunch of times over the last couple of years.

321
00:18:14,331 --> 00:18:18,866
Speaker 1: I played it once while it was going through its paces and it was stupidly fun.

322
00:18:19,268 --> 00:18:19,749
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

323
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:22,358
Speaker 1: So it has now been officially announced.

324
00:18:22,458 --> 00:18:25,229
Speaker 1: Interestingly, the official first source was Forbes.

325
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:25,912
Speaker 0: Okay.

326
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:27,539
Speaker 1: So props to them for getting that set up.

327
00:18:28,341 --> 00:18:31,836
Speaker 0: But uh, I don't know why Forbes cares about tabletop role playing.

328
00:18:31,876 --> 00:18:36,880
Speaker 1: Well, it's Eric Kane, a contributor to Forbes who quote, I write about video games, the industry and the culture.

329
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:37,301
Speaker 0: Okay.

330
00:18:37,542 --> 00:18:39,009
Speaker 1: This isn't non video game.

331
00:18:39,070 --> 00:18:55,504
Speaker 1: Anyway, I guess he decides what to contribute and they say, so the actual title of the game is torchbearer and it is basically the feels you get from playing old, original dungeons and dragons without the mapping, but with all the other parts streamline.

332
00:18:55,544 --> 00:19:00,062
Speaker 1: So it forces you to make the decisions instead of, did I draw the map correctly?

333
00:19:00,143 --> 00:19:01,148
Speaker 1: Where are we on the map?

334
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,294
Speaker 1: Did you fuck up the map?

335
00:19:02,495 --> 00:19:09,618
Speaker 1: What happened to the map to, are you going to carry that baby out or the treasure chest or your swords?

336
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:11,263
Speaker 0: I have a bag now.

337
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,653
Speaker 0: Now I have four extra slots in the bag.

338
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:15,822
Speaker 0: I'm going to put these things in the bag.

339
00:19:15,922 --> 00:19:18,091
Speaker 0: You carry, you have a free hand here.

340
00:19:18,171 --> 00:19:18,733
Speaker 0: Carry this.

341
00:19:19,055 --> 00:19:19,838
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a monster.

342
00:19:19,918 --> 00:19:22,711
Speaker 0: I put this shit on the ground and fight and then I picked the shit back up.

343
00:19:23,314 --> 00:19:26,407
Speaker 1: Oh, you, uh, that's your last 10 foot pole that you just broke there.

344
00:19:26,427 --> 00:19:27,953
Speaker 0: You're going to do now.

345
00:19:28,736 --> 00:19:29,057
Speaker 0: Yeah.

346
00:19:29,439 --> 00:19:32,650
Speaker 0: You mean my one 10 foot pole I was able to carry because it's two handed.

347
00:19:33,513 --> 00:19:35,602
Speaker 1: So basically look forward to this.

348
00:19:35,662 --> 00:19:38,539
Speaker 1: I'll probably get Lou Crane on to talk about it in a little more detail.

349
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:44,503
Speaker 0: because I mean, another interesting thing is that this time, uh, I think Tor is credited or is the writer.

350
00:19:44,543 --> 00:19:46,169
Speaker 0: writer and Lou Crane was the editor.

351
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:48,758
Speaker 0: A role reversal role reversal.

352
00:19:48,899 --> 00:19:49,180
Speaker 0: Yeah.

353
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:51,148
Speaker 1: You know, maybe we should try to get tour on the show.

354
00:19:51,611 --> 00:19:52,555
Speaker 0: Yeah.

355
00:19:52,616 --> 00:19:53,440
Speaker 0: I saw him at the mocha.

356
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:56,621
Speaker 0: I was just, well, I was just looking at the, in the museum thing in the back and there he was.

357
00:19:56,641 --> 00:19:59,074
Speaker 1: And I was like, Luke and or Jared, we never get tour.

358
00:19:59,637 --> 00:20:00,139
Speaker 1: I'll bug tar.

359
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:00,660
Speaker 1: I'll see if he'll come on.

360
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:01,001
Speaker 1: geek guys.

361
00:20:01,021 --> 00:20:01,681
Speaker 1: Talk about this stuff.

362
00:20:01,942 --> 00:20:02,202
Speaker 1: Okay.

363
00:20:02,842 --> 00:20:03,663
Speaker 0: He's, he's a fun guy.

364
00:20:09,969 --> 00:20:13,499
Speaker 1: So things of the day, I'm surprised we didn't talk about this sooner.

365
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:15,486
Speaker 1: The chrono jigga.

366
00:20:15,506 --> 00:20:17,354
Speaker 0: I thought we did talk about this.

367
00:20:17,374 --> 00:20:18,058
Speaker 1: I guess we didn't.

368
00:20:18,079 --> 00:20:22,659
Speaker 1: I can't find any reference to it as a thing of the day unless I didn't put the word chrono in it.

369
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,141
Speaker 0: Okay.

370
00:20:23,362 --> 00:20:30,005
Speaker 1: But, uh, the chrono jigga smash-ups between chrono trigger music and Jay Z made by this guy.

371
00:20:30,025 --> 00:20:31,751
Speaker 0: I think two mellow is the guy's name.

372
00:20:32,633 --> 00:20:37,186
Speaker 0: Uh, but Jay Z two mellow is the guy who did the mixing.

373
00:20:37,326 --> 00:20:37,988
Speaker 1: It's too mellow.

374
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:40,701
Speaker 1: I was reading this whole thing cause it's on a YouTube channel.

375
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:41,787
Speaker 1: Bruce bonsai.

376
00:20:41,847 --> 00:20:43,133
Speaker 0: This is pretty epic right here.

377
00:20:43,173 --> 00:20:44,418
Speaker 0: You gotta just search.

378
00:20:44,659 --> 00:20:48,274
Speaker 1: I've been listening to this shit pretty much constantly for a couple of weeks.

379
00:20:48,294 --> 00:20:50,265
Speaker 0: The website, you just download the whole thing for free.

380
00:20:50,286 --> 00:20:50,728
Speaker 0: Yeah.

381
00:20:50,849 --> 00:20:55,993
Speaker 1: Or you kids today seem to just listen to things on YouTube, so they'll probably just listen to it on YouTube.

382
00:20:56,013 --> 00:20:56,675
Speaker 1: I know how you work.

383
00:20:57,097 --> 00:20:58,140
Speaker 0: I downloaded, put it on my iPhone.

384
00:20:58,401 --> 00:20:58,722
Speaker 1: You do.

385
00:20:58,743 --> 00:21:02,677
Speaker 0: Oh, so my thing of the day, the thing of the day.

386
00:21:02,697 --> 00:21:08,078
Speaker 0: So, uh, there's a show, there's a guy named Dan Levitard who's a Miami sports journalist, right?

387
00:21:08,499 --> 00:21:17,433
Speaker 0: And he appears on PTI sometimes on which is a show that geek nights was loosely based upon as like, he's like a stand in guy and he started this new show.

388
00:21:17,493 --> 00:21:20,506
Speaker 0: I think it's like on ESPN two or three or something, whatever.

389
00:21:21,089 --> 00:21:30,525
Speaker 0: it's, you know, it's, it's one of those, you know, extra shows, but basically what he does, he sits in a kitchen TV studio with his dad who's like the funniest guy.

390
00:21:30,545 --> 00:21:36,847
Speaker 0: Uh, he escaped from Cuba and they talk about sports stuff and interview people and it's so crazy.

391
00:21:36,927 --> 00:21:44,678
Speaker 0: But here they watch a video of a horse race and it's probably one of the best things I've ever seen in horse racing is horse.

392
00:21:44,858 --> 00:21:45,801
Speaker 0: What's the horse's name?

393
00:21:45,861 --> 00:21:48,910
Speaker 0: Spicer Cub is way horse names.

394
00:21:49,050 --> 00:21:50,216
Speaker 0: It's crazy fast horse.

395
00:21:50,899 --> 00:22:00,320
Speaker 0: And then in the middle of the horse race, the horse just sort of like goes off and like runs to the outside of the track and everybody starts passing him like, Hey, then the horse comes back.

396
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,151
Speaker 0: Then it runs away to the outside of the track again.

397
00:22:03,171 --> 00:22:05,241
Speaker 0: It's like, where is this horse trying to go into the crowd?

398
00:22:05,321 --> 00:22:07,250
Speaker 0: Is it three possibilities?

399
00:22:07,790 --> 00:22:09,636
Speaker 1: One horse is bored.

400
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:17,462
Speaker 0: Someone in the audience in the grandstand is waving carrots around three the jockey be a trash talking.

401
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:21,476
Speaker 0: Who knows what's going on, but there's something you got to see what this horse is up to.

402
00:22:21,717 --> 00:22:23,384
Speaker 1: We ever done a show on trash talk?

403
00:22:23,886 --> 00:22:24,267
Speaker 0: I don't know.

404
00:22:24,308 --> 00:22:30,317
Speaker 1: Cause I realized this bringing, you know, we always talk about the difference between pre hoc and post hoc trash talk.

405
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:36,498
Speaker 1: You know, the Babe Ruth point before the game is very different from yeah, I beat you after the game.

406
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:41,998
Speaker 1: But there's also the trash talk of, look at this, I'm just throwing away victory points.

407
00:22:42,119 --> 00:22:43,084
Speaker 1: What you can do about it?

408
00:22:43,205 --> 00:22:45,657
Speaker 1: I'm actually harming yourself in the middle of the game.

409
00:22:46,199 --> 00:22:46,461
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:22:46,863 --> 00:22:51,779
Speaker 1: It's like in the bike race, you just stop and tie your shoe baseball.

411
00:22:51,799 --> 00:22:57,138
Speaker 1: You walk out and you're just like, ah, I'm just gonna butt right here and let you start get me out.

412
00:22:57,419 --> 00:22:58,566
Speaker 1: All right, we got two outs on.

413
00:22:58,626 --> 00:23:00,474
Speaker 1: All right, let's uh, now we'll play for real.

414
00:23:00,775 --> 00:23:01,176
Speaker 0: All right.

415
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:07,077
Speaker 0: So meta moment, the book club bookies, the player games by Ian M. Banks.

416
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:08,804
Speaker 0: I've started reading it again.

417
00:23:08,864 --> 00:23:12,843
Speaker 0: I picked up where I left off and I just got to the best parts and I'm crazy.

418
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:14,049
Speaker 0: I really want to go home and read more.

419
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:18,154
Speaker 1: I got to start reading it again, but I've been biking to work every day and I tend to read mostly on the subway.

420
00:23:18,214 --> 00:23:19,922
Speaker 0: I tend to read mostly while going to sleep.

421
00:23:21,167 --> 00:23:23,719
Speaker 1: So, uh, we're going to be at anime Boston, which is may 24th, 25th, 26th.

422
00:23:23,759 --> 00:23:28,841
Speaker 1: We're doing not one, not two, not three, not four, but five lectures.

423
00:23:28,861 --> 00:23:30,688
Speaker 0: We're doing too many goddamn lectures.

424
00:23:30,768 --> 00:23:32,253
Speaker 1: Emily is doing one as well.

425
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:35,042

Speaker 1: So we're gonna, anime Boston is going to be rocking out and in between these events, we're going to hang out with my tool, hang out with a lot of you guys probably spend a lot of time in the gaming area of anime Boston that

427
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,375
Speaker 0: we hardly ever spend time.

428
00:23:47,476 --> 00:23:50,090
Speaker 1: Probably eat a lot of secret breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

429
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:50,913
Speaker 0: Play a lot of net runner.

430
00:23:50,933 --> 00:23:52,258
Speaker 1: Yeah.

431
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,161
Speaker 0: All right.

432
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:53,985
Speaker 0: While eating good food.

Speaker 1: So we are also going to be at Pax Australia.

434
00:23:57,636 --> 00:23:58,197
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

Speaker 1: July 19th, 21st.

436
00:24:00,603 --> 00:24:03,530
Speaker 1: We are doing between one and three lectures.

437
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,492
Speaker 1: I'm not sure yet.

438
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:05,514
Speaker 1: Okay.

439
00:24:06,216 --> 00:24:09,163
Speaker 1: And the weekend directly before that.

440
00:24:09,424 --> 00:24:16,667
Speaker 1: Connecticut where we are two of the three people who run the panels, workshops and special events department.

441
00:24:17,169 --> 00:24:24,298
Speaker 1: We're in the middle of scheduling the entire convention and then we're going to be there running 13 or 14 panel rooms.

442
00:24:24,619 --> 00:24:28,796
Speaker 0: If you're competent and you want to help us out, we could use some help in our department.

443
00:24:28,977 --> 00:24:34,801
Speaker 1: Many enforcer friends have stepped up and I'm in the process of getting them all situated so we can do this.

444
00:24:35,122 --> 00:24:39,963
Speaker 0: We mostly need people because they're actually two buildings at Connecticut on the convention center and the hotel.

445
00:24:40,365 --> 00:24:43,338
Speaker 0: We mostly need people to stay in that hotel.

446
00:24:43,378 --> 00:24:45,688
Speaker 1: People for a bunch more fundamental reason than that.

447
00:24:45,789 --> 00:24:48,360
Speaker 1: That is brought to light by the fact that Pax Australia.

448
00:24:48,601 --> 00:24:51,817
Speaker 0: So number one, people can stay in that hotel so we don't have to go over there ever.

449
00:24:51,917 --> 00:24:57,905
Speaker 0: And two, so we can actually take a goddamn break at some point during the convention and maybe play a game of net runner.

450
00:24:58,085 --> 00:25:01,638
Speaker 1: I am definitely not missing the days.

451
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:07,399
Speaker 1: I'm at the convention center at 7am and then I walk out at midnight 30 after we locked all the doors.

452
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:13,503
Speaker 0: That's been what it's been for back into the convention center at 7am before I'm in there, before everyone else.

453
00:25:13,563 --> 00:25:17,939
Speaker 1: And last year I took a 45 minute break to have one cocktail with Dave Riley.

454
00:25:17,999 --> 00:25:21,111
Speaker 0: Last year I took a break to see Super Art Fight.

455
00:25:21,192 --> 00:25:21,875
Speaker 1: I also did that.

456
00:25:22,076 --> 00:25:23,684
Speaker 0: That was all I took a break for.

457
00:25:23,764 --> 00:25:25,573
Speaker 0: I didn't even play one goddamn board game.

458
00:25:25,995 --> 00:25:30,356
Speaker 1: The only reason I get that break for a cocktail is that I happen to be out of radio range and didn't realize it.

459
00:25:30,376 --> 00:25:52,552
Speaker 1: OK, so, yeah, but the main reason we're trying to get staff who aren't us and our personal close like family friends is that it was pointed out that if we ever got bored and left or say Pax Australia had been on the same weekend, basically none of us would be able to go to Connecticut and suddenly 90% of our department is gone.

460
00:25:52,712 --> 00:25:52,973
Speaker 0: Right.

461
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,262
Speaker 1: So we're trying to get people who aren't us to help out.

462
00:25:56,503 --> 00:25:56,703
Speaker 0: Right.

463
00:25:58,528 --> 00:26:05,499
Speaker 0: Other meta, I just want to remind everybody that we have a lot of Internet presence, whatever your favorite Internet place is, we are there.

464
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,648
Speaker 0: We got a Web site, frontrecruit.com.

465
00:26:07,889 --> 00:26:11,344
Speaker 0: We got an email newsletter which you can subscribe to frontrecruit.com.

466
00:26:11,364 --> 00:26:12,147
Speaker 0: We got Twitters.

467
00:26:12,428 --> 00:26:13,472
Speaker 0: We got Facebooks.

468
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:14,997
Speaker 0: We got Google pluses.

469
00:26:15,298 --> 00:26:16,241
Speaker 0: We have all.

470
00:26:16,261 --> 00:26:17,184
Speaker 0: we have a forum.

471
00:26:17,505 --> 00:26:19,974
Speaker 0: We have every possible thing you can imagine.

472
00:26:19,994 --> 00:26:24,254
Speaker 0: We have an IRC channel that people actually have been in consistently for a long time.

473
00:26:24,274 --> 00:26:24,976
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

474
00:26:25,538 --> 00:26:28,730
Speaker 0: No matter what your Internet flavor is, we have that flavor.

475
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:32,163
Speaker 0: We even have a podcast and YouTube channels, believe it or not.

476
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:33,226
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

477
00:26:33,748 --> 00:26:38,910
Speaker 0: Oh, speaking of YouTube channels, I posted a bunch of videos and my personal YouTube of Netrunner games.

478
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:39,512
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

479
00:26:39,934 --> 00:26:42,163
Speaker 1: And on my YouTube channel, we have it.

480
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:48,867
Speaker 1: It's more anime related, but we're doing a 40 or 50 episode deep analysis of an anime called Shojo Akaka Me Utena.

481
00:26:48,887 --> 00:26:51,297
Speaker 1: That's our kind of big project right now.

482
00:26:51,378 --> 00:26:52,844
Speaker 1: So if you like that, spread the word.

483
00:26:52,965 --> 00:26:53,226
Speaker 0: All right.

484
00:26:53,266 --> 00:26:54,512
Speaker 0: So let's get to the main vid.

485
00:26:54,672 --> 00:26:55,034
Speaker 0: All right.

486
00:26:55,254 --> 00:26:57,101
Speaker 1: So King's Bounty.

487
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:58,787
Speaker 1: Why the fuck should I play that game?

488
00:26:58,807 --> 00:27:00,433
Speaker 1: Here's what I remember.

489
00:27:00,794 --> 00:27:05,914
Speaker 1: And this is going back like eight years, seven years, maybe you were like, you got to play this game.

490
00:27:05,934 --> 00:27:07,925
Speaker 1: You don't say because I didn't play Sega games.

491
00:27:07,966 --> 00:27:08,670
Speaker 1: I was a real kid.

492
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,472
Speaker 1: I was a smart kid.

493
00:27:09,492 --> 00:27:10,175
Speaker 1: I didn't intend to.

494
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,502
Speaker 1: So King's Bounty.

495
00:27:12,522 --> 00:27:16,937
Speaker 1: I turn on the emulator and I see a screen like that.

496
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,272
Speaker 1: And there's a guy on a horse who takes up like a full sixth of the screen.

497
00:27:21,292 --> 00:27:22,938
Speaker 0: That's the right map.

498
00:27:23,761 --> 00:27:28,899
Speaker 1: I walked around and it looked like it was fighting on similarly small non granular maps.

499
00:27:29,741 --> 00:27:31,347
Speaker 0: OK, so here's what King's Bounty is.

500
00:27:31,367 --> 00:27:36,746
Speaker 0: If you've ever played Heroes of Might and Magic, King's Bounty is sort of a baby's first.

501
00:27:37,087 --> 00:27:39,817
Speaker 0: It's a simplified version that you can play in a Sega Genesis.

502
00:27:40,098 --> 00:27:40,339
Speaker 0: Right.

503
00:27:40,981 --> 00:27:44,012
Speaker 0: And it's the reason that this is a good game.

504
00:27:44,574 --> 00:27:44,835
Speaker 0: Right.

505
00:27:44,936 --> 00:27:50,698
Speaker 0: Is because it is, you know, normally you would be like, oh, well, this is the golden eye to a counter strike.

506
00:27:50,738 --> 00:27:50,898
Speaker 0: Right.

507
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:51,642
Speaker 0: It's not as good.

508
00:27:51,702 --> 00:27:52,928
Speaker 0: It's baby's first.

509
00:27:53,249 --> 00:27:53,450
Speaker 0: Right.

510
00:27:53,890 --> 00:28:04,517
Speaker 0: But actually, Heroes of Might and Magic, in my opinion, is one of those games that has so much unnecessary complexity, like a million numbers that you mostly just ignore because no one can possibly pay attention to all those numbers.

511
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:22,664
Speaker 0: So this by simplifying it is actually streamlining it while still giving you all the same fun going from town to town, having people join your army, going on quests, all that same good stuff from Heroes of Might and Magic into a simpler game that you can play in a Sega Genesis.

512
00:28:22,724 --> 00:28:32,333
Speaker 0: Now, they're actually if you go on steam, these new King's Bounty games, which actually I kind of like and hate at the same time.

513
00:28:32,414 --> 00:28:32,655
Speaker 0: Right.

514
00:28:33,096 --> 00:28:39,324
Speaker 0: On the one hand, they really enhance the graphics and modernist and they're much easier to play than the old King's Bounty.

515
00:28:39,444 --> 00:28:42,377
Speaker 0: I even like them better than the new Heroes of Might and Magic, which I've played.

516
00:28:43,962 --> 00:28:49,260
Speaker 0: But the main one problem I have with them is that you cannot speed up the combat.

517
00:28:50,303 --> 00:29:02,410
Speaker 0: As a result, it just takes forever to play because a combat that could be over in like 30 seconds lasts multiple minutes, simply because even if you speed up all the animations and turn them off and everything is just slow.

518
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:06,210
Speaker 0: It's like you click, you go and it's like, no, you got to wait for these guys to move.

519
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:12,520
Speaker 0: It's like if it moved as fast as I clicked, it's the Pokemon problem where the battle should be as fast as I can press the buttons.

520
00:29:12,982 --> 00:29:13,243
Speaker 0: Right.

521
00:29:13,584 --> 00:29:14,870
Speaker 0: And then Pokemon would be amazing.

522
00:29:14,950 --> 00:29:19,190
Speaker 0: But because you had to sit there and wait for the guy to go like, it's super effective.

523
00:29:19,810 --> 00:29:22,303
Speaker 0: It adds like a whole minute or two onto each battle.

524
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:23,107
Speaker 0: It's like, kill me now.

525
00:29:23,167 --> 00:29:28,427
Speaker 1: That is why I basically never actually beat the Nobunaga's Ambition Pokemon because it was fun.

526
00:29:28,447 --> 00:29:31,017
Speaker 1: And then I just didn't want to deal with that bullshit.

527
00:29:31,459 --> 00:29:35,855
Speaker 1: And I always say that Final Fantasy Tactics is baby's first tactical game.

528
00:29:36,697 --> 00:29:40,748
Speaker 1: Well, Pokemon Nobunaga is baby's first tactics.

529
00:29:40,868 --> 00:29:44,483
Speaker 0: So this is why I like King's Bounty, at least, you know.

530
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:47,780
Speaker 0: And the thing is, I know the episode, I guess you tried to title it King's Games.

531
00:29:47,881 --> 00:29:48,947
Speaker 0: Only Scott Could Love.

532
00:29:49,007 --> 00:29:50,476
Speaker 1: That's just because that's a turn of phrase.

533
00:29:50,516 --> 00:29:51,723
Speaker 1: Like only a mother could love.

534
00:29:51,743 --> 00:29:52,829
Speaker 0: But it's not what it means.

535
00:29:52,849 --> 00:29:57,863
Speaker 1: Because I found King's Bounty to be incredibly simplistic and boring.

536
00:29:58,425 --> 00:30:01,115
Speaker 1: I also don't like the Might and Magic games that much.

537
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:03,671
Speaker 0: Well, there's a difference between Might and Magic and Heroes of Might and Magic.

538
00:30:03,692 --> 00:30:08,793
Speaker 0: They're in the same world, universe, fantasy land, but they are completely different genres of game.

539
00:30:08,813 --> 00:30:10,502
Speaker 1: You realize I don't even like Fire Emblem.

540
00:30:11,206 --> 00:30:11,970
Speaker 0: Well, you got a problem.

541
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,959
Speaker 1: They all pale before Advance Wars.

542
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,245
Speaker 1: I just don't enjoy.

543
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:17,619
Speaker 0: Because they're not about the same thing that Advance Wars is about.

544
00:30:17,639 --> 00:30:19,291
Speaker 1: I know, and I don't like what those games are about as much.

545
00:30:19,311 --> 00:30:20,495
Speaker 0: It's Advance Wars with dating.

546
00:30:21,278 --> 00:30:22,301
Speaker 1: Ah, not quite.

547
00:30:22,943 --> 00:30:23,525
Speaker 1: Not quite.

548
00:30:23,967 --> 00:30:27,036
Speaker 1: It's Advance Wars with dating and not being that hard.

549
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:40,210
Speaker 0: Anyway, so yeah, what the episode is really about is most of the games I'm going to mention here are not necessarily games that I like that everyone else hates or thinks are bad games, even though some of them might be that way.

550
00:30:40,611 --> 00:30:44,208
Speaker 0: They're mostly games that I think are a plus games or I really care about.

551
00:30:44,268 --> 00:30:48,125
Speaker 0: that are just possibly even if people like them, they're mostly ignored.

552
00:30:48,185 --> 00:30:49,049
Speaker 0: No one brings them up.

553
00:30:49,069 --> 00:30:50,215
Speaker 0: No one talks about them.

554
00:30:50,235 --> 00:30:51,099
Speaker 0: They're unmentioned.

555
00:30:51,401 --> 00:30:53,632
Speaker 0: They might not be obscure games like you've heard of them.

556
00:30:53,752 --> 00:30:56,324
Speaker 0: You know, they exist maybe depending on how cool you are.

557
00:30:56,826 --> 00:30:59,559
Speaker 0: But they're games that are like high on my list.

558
00:30:59,579 --> 00:30:59,720
Speaker 0: Like.

559
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:05,164
Speaker 0: I think these are like some of the greats and you don't see them talked or discussed almost ever.

560
00:31:05,245 --> 00:31:06,229
Speaker 0: That's most of the games.

561
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:08,799
Speaker 0: Those some of them may also be games that I like and other people hate.

562
00:31:08,819 --> 00:31:14,906
Speaker 0: OK, so, you know, and the degree to which people don't talk about them may vary.

563
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:15,247
Speaker 0: Right.

564
00:31:15,267 --> 00:31:19,124
Speaker 0: So, for example, one of the first games on my list, you know, Descent one, two, three.

565
00:31:19,425 --> 00:31:19,646
Speaker 0: Right.

566
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:22,762
Speaker 0: You don't see a lot of people talking about Descent too often.

567
00:31:22,782 --> 00:31:26,499
Speaker 0: You know, I think Descent, the whole series one, two, three is some of the best there is.

568
00:31:26,519 --> 00:31:30,275
Speaker 1: I actually really enjoyed Descent games as a kid.

569
00:31:30,315 --> 00:31:30,396
Speaker 0: Yeah.

570
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:31,482
Speaker 0: See, Rim doesn't hate Descent.

571
00:31:31,864 --> 00:31:33,634
Speaker 0: But how often do you hear people talk about Descent?

572
00:31:33,694 --> 00:31:36,870
Speaker 0: People talk about free space a lot more often than talk about Descent.

573
00:31:36,950 --> 00:31:39,159
Speaker 0: But I think Descent is way better than free space.

574
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:40,264
Speaker 1: Do you hate Aerobiz?

575
00:31:41,167 --> 00:31:42,977
Speaker 0: Not really, but it's not like I'm going to play it.

576
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:43,360
Speaker 1: Yeah.

577
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:49,210
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't need to play Descent again, but I bought Descent on GOG.com and I did play it recently and still great, I guess.

578
00:31:49,330 --> 00:31:52,100
Speaker 0: And I realized that back in the day I was controlling it all wrong.

579
00:31:52,381 --> 00:31:52,983
Speaker 1: Yeah.

580
00:31:53,003 --> 00:31:58,744
Speaker 1: I always wanted crazy mouse man mouse as you could like rotate the space.

581
00:31:58,784 --> 00:31:59,527
Speaker 0: People don't know.

582
00:31:59,547 --> 00:32:09,970
Speaker 0: the stick with Descent is that on the one hand, it's a lot like Doom in that you're in sort of like this maze map with all sorts of secrets and lots of bad guys coming at you from every direction.

583
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,379
Speaker 0: It's very similar to Doom in that sort of.

584
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,206
Speaker 0: it's a run and gun FPS, right?

585
00:32:14,226 --> 00:32:17,300
Speaker 0: With guys everywhere and lots of items to pick up and shit like that.

586
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:18,364
Speaker 0: It's really awesome.

587
00:32:18,706 --> 00:32:21,358
Speaker 0: And it also Descent has a multiplayer aspect.

588
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:22,243
Speaker 0: Descent two and three.

589
00:32:22,263 --> 00:32:33,036
Speaker 0: Descent three actually had really good multiplayer, but it's full 3D, not in the way that Quake and Counter-Strike and, you know, tribes are full 3D.

590
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:34,922
Speaker 1: But as in what direction am I moving?

591
00:32:35,003 --> 00:32:38,173
Speaker 0: It's full 3D like Tie Fighter full 3D.

592
00:32:38,233 --> 00:32:43,569
Speaker 0: It's an FPS where you can, you know, pitch and yaw and shift left and right.

593
00:32:43,649 --> 00:32:51,458
Speaker 0: And, you know, you can do barrel rolls and you can, you know, do every possible movement that a ship can move in zero gravity.

594
00:32:51,619 --> 00:32:53,485
Speaker 0: It is awesome.

595
00:32:53,986 --> 00:32:55,571
Speaker 0: And there's so many items you can get.

596
00:32:55,692 --> 00:33:00,070
Speaker 0: And if you haven't played Descent, you should go to GOG.com and buy that right away.

597
00:33:00,811 --> 00:33:03,761
Speaker 0: You notice I'm starting here with my GOG.com list.

598
00:33:03,921 --> 00:33:04,624
Speaker 1: Yeah.

599
00:33:05,025 --> 00:33:12,110
Speaker 0: Uh, so the only other game that I have on GOG.com that I think people don't talk about enough is Shogo Mobile Armor Division.

600
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:12,812
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

601
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:15,243
Speaker 1: I forgot that game existed until just now, right?

602
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,277
Speaker 0: So people do bring up this game once in a while.

603
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:25,951
Speaker 0: And the only reason I know about this game is because I bought a three button Logitech gaming mouse when I got my, built my first computer in 1998, 1999.

604
00:33:25,951 --> 00:33:29,783
Speaker 0: And it came with this game for free on a CD-ROM.

605
00:33:30,405 --> 00:33:33,659
Speaker 0: And I didn't understand fully appreciate this game when it came out.

606
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:36,935
Speaker 0: But first of all, this game is the predecessor to the Fear series.

607
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:42,457
Speaker 0: You'll even notice a tribute to this game is hidden in a secret room in the first Fear game.

608
00:33:42,477 --> 00:33:49,185
Speaker 0: And when I played that first Fear game after buying it for cheap on steam, I found that room not knowing it existed.

609
00:33:49,225 --> 00:33:50,149
Speaker 0: just because I'm that good.

610
00:33:50,189 --> 00:33:51,615
Speaker 0: I find secret rooms on my own.

611
00:33:52,117 --> 00:33:56,156
Speaker 0: And I went over to a radio and pushed a button and that music from Shogo was playing.

612
00:33:56,176 --> 00:33:57,925
Speaker 0: And I was like, Oh, you are fucking kidding me.

613
00:33:58,247 --> 00:34:03,350
Speaker 0: I discovered it legit and I knew, and I caught the reference, but Shogo Mobile Armor Division is an FPS.

614
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:05,517
Speaker 0: in some levels you're on foot.

615
00:34:05,959 --> 00:34:15,199
Speaker 0: And in some levels you're in a giant robot, but what you don't realize right away is that both of that are sort of in the same, it's not like there's two games and you switch between them.

616
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:22,502
Speaker 0: It's literally, there's some levels where you're on foot and there are the giant robots and some levels are in the giant robot and there are people on foot like shooting at you with little guns.

617
00:34:22,542 --> 00:34:27,783
Speaker 0: Like they're in the same space and the robots are huge, like Gundam, Evangelion size.

618
00:34:27,864 --> 00:34:34,511
Speaker 1: Sense of scale is something I've just, I've never seen it in another game done so well, especially for the era of this game came out.

619
00:34:34,551 --> 00:34:36,918
Speaker 1: I mean, this was what, late nineties.

620
00:34:37,099 --> 00:34:37,500
Speaker 0: Yeah.

621
00:34:37,841 --> 00:34:47,215
Speaker 0: And the thing is 98 game has so many anime references and as an, and it has a typical anime plot and there's like fake Evangelion posters and you

622
00:34:47,315 --> 00:34:54,667
Speaker 1: might assume that it's either some Akira looking thing or some ghost in the shell looking thing, maybe apple seed if you're a little more hardcore.

623
00:34:54,706 --> 00:35:01,254
Speaker 0: If you play this and you know, anime, there is so much just in the, in the theme of this game for you, right?

624
00:35:01,274 --> 00:35:08,972
Speaker 0: There's even a little plot where people talk to you over the radio, like Gundam, you know, while you're doing the mission, all these anime characters and oh, it's, it's so good.

625
00:35:08,992 --> 00:35:09,535
Speaker 0: I love this game.

626
00:35:10,157 --> 00:35:11,162
Speaker 0: All right, let's move on.

627
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:12,107
Speaker 0: King's bounty.

628
00:35:12,167 --> 00:35:12,448
Speaker 0: Sure.

629
00:35:12,729 --> 00:35:14,436
Speaker 1: Wait, didn't that game use the lith tech engine?

630
00:35:14,456 --> 00:35:16,384
Speaker 0: Uh, I think so.

631
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:16,685
Speaker 0: Yeah.

632
00:35:16,786 --> 00:35:22,545
Speaker 1: Wasn't that the engine used in that amazingly shitty diehard Nakatomi Plaza game?

633
00:35:22,605 --> 00:35:23,608
Speaker 1: I remember, I don't know.

634
00:35:23,749 --> 00:35:24,391
Speaker 0: Go find out.

635
00:35:24,431 --> 00:35:24,813
Speaker 0: I don't know.

636
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,238
Speaker 1: We'll find out anyway.

637
00:35:26,258 --> 00:35:36,132
Speaker 0: Uh, so another game that is a game that lots of people love all over the place, but hardly anyone talks about these days is mech warrior two.

638
00:35:37,115 --> 00:35:38,880
Speaker 0: Why doesn't anyone talk about mech warrior two?

639
00:35:39,241 --> 00:35:41,368
Speaker 1: I only played it on the SNES.

640
00:35:41,769 --> 00:35:43,136
Speaker 0: Mech warrior two wasn't on the SNES.

641
00:35:43,156 --> 00:35:45,510
Speaker 1: There was a mech warrior game on the, it might've just been mech warrior.

642
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,594
Speaker 0: It might've just been mech warrior.

643
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:49,908
Speaker 0: Mech warrior two for the PC was game of the year.

644
00:35:49,969 --> 00:35:53,901
Speaker 0: when it came out, I think in 95 in like PC gamer and whatever.

645
00:35:54,322 --> 00:35:56,910
Speaker 0: This game was unbelievable, right?

646
00:35:57,211 --> 00:35:57,673
Speaker 0: I played it.

647
00:35:57,693 --> 00:36:01,890
Speaker 0: I even got the expansion, uh, which let you play as the snow clan, right?

648
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:05,462
Speaker 0: And I think mech warrior mercenaries came out, which was okay.

649
00:36:05,483 --> 00:36:05,563
Speaker 1: Okay.

650
00:36:05,904 --> 00:36:08,897
Speaker 1: So I was right about the lith tech engine.

651
00:36:08,978 --> 00:36:09,501
Speaker 1: You know why.

652
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:11,914
Speaker 1: I remember there's not going to be Plaza game because it's the fruit fuck.

653
00:36:11,954 --> 00:36:13,860
Speaker 1: That is the origin of the fruit fucker.

654
00:36:14,081 --> 00:36:14,743
Speaker 0: There you go.

655
00:36:16,168 --> 00:36:20,529
Speaker 1: Next for a bajillion dollars, you receive absolutely free at the goddamn lith tech engine.

656
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:25,832
Speaker 1: Use it to make your own shitty games based on ancient movie licenses like diehard Nakatomi Plaza.

657
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:26,253
Speaker 1: Yeah.

658
00:36:26,273 --> 00:36:28,801
Speaker 1: I think this was the second fruit fucker comic.

659
00:36:29,223 --> 00:36:29,684
Speaker 0: Maybe.

660
00:36:30,326 --> 00:36:30,647
Speaker 0: All right.

661
00:36:30,707 --> 00:36:36,710
Speaker 0: Anyway, but yeah, mech warrior two also is a little tricky to play on modern, you know, computers.

662
00:36:36,730 --> 00:36:38,057
Speaker 0: You got to use DOS box or whatever.

663
00:36:38,077 --> 00:36:39,123
Speaker 0: And even then it was flaky.

664
00:36:39,143 --> 00:36:41,776
Speaker 0: The last time I tried, it was flaky on DOS, right?

665
00:36:41,796 --> 00:36:43,001
Speaker 0: I think there was a window.

666
00:36:43,101 --> 00:36:47,221
Speaker 0: I think there was a windows 95 version you could get, but that would even be flaky today.

667
00:36:47,603 --> 00:36:49,473
Speaker 0: You'd have to use some sort of compatibility modes.

668
00:36:49,955 --> 00:36:52,064
Speaker 0: I really wish they would fucking to remake this shit.

669
00:36:52,125 --> 00:37:01,381
Speaker 1: because holy crap, mech warrior two, the mech warrior in general, I'm not super happy with a lot of modern met games because they tend to focus on the aspects.

670
00:37:01,442 --> 00:37:08,835
Speaker 0: I wasn't that interested because they can't, you know, in the xbox it sort of went over to mech assault and it became more about the FPS part and less like.

671
00:37:08,916 --> 00:37:11,124
Speaker 0: it was less and less like battle tech.

672
00:37:11,566 --> 00:37:17,026
Speaker 0: You know, mech warrior two has actually a lot in common with the on tabletop, you know, war.

673
00:37:17,046 --> 00:37:17,749
Speaker 1: That's why I liked it.

674
00:37:17,809 --> 00:37:26,772
Speaker 0: It was more about what weapons do you have and how many of them, whereas a lot of the other games like mech assault, you know, came, went closer to being more like tribes, but you're in a robot.

675
00:37:26,852 --> 00:37:26,953
Speaker 0: Yeah.

676
00:37:26,993 --> 00:37:30,753
Speaker 1: Except mech assault became one of those walk backwards shooting people from a distance.

677
00:37:31,054 --> 00:37:31,335
Speaker 0: Yeah.

678
00:37:31,395 --> 00:37:35,474
Speaker 0: And now I guess they have, what's the one with the crazy controller that they always play at pecs.

679
00:37:36,257 --> 00:37:38,284
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't remember the name of it.

680
00:37:38,304 --> 00:37:40,332
Speaker 0: Steel battalion, the steel battalion.

681
00:37:40,372 --> 00:37:42,420
Speaker 0: And there's, what's the new, the indie one war Hawk.

682
00:37:43,163 --> 00:37:43,545
Speaker 0: Is that it?

683
00:37:43,645 --> 00:37:43,926
Speaker 0: No.

684
00:37:44,147 --> 00:37:45,432
Speaker 1: Well there's Hawking.

685
00:37:45,954 --> 00:37:51,012
Speaker 1: That's the one which has a lot of, uh, grindy elements that immediately take me out of the game.

686
00:37:51,093 --> 00:37:51,635
Speaker 0: Exactly.

687
00:37:51,875 --> 00:37:54,224
Speaker 1: It's super fun, but it's still two FPS.

688
00:37:54,746 --> 00:37:54,987
Speaker 0: All right.

689
00:37:55,408 --> 00:37:59,385
Speaker 0: So let's talk about some games that I know rim actually doesn't like.

690
00:37:59,425 --> 00:37:59,826
Speaker 0: You're ready?

691
00:37:59,847 --> 00:38:00,489
Speaker 0: All right.

692
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:00,831
Speaker 1: All right.

693
00:38:00,851 --> 00:38:02,416
Speaker 0: I'm ready to talk about Yoshi's cookie.

694
00:38:02,858 --> 00:38:03,541
Speaker 1: Fuck that game.

695
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,668
Speaker 0: I love Yoshi's cookie.

696
00:38:05,689 --> 00:38:06,954
Speaker 0: Yoshi's cookie is awesome.

697
00:38:07,215 --> 00:38:10,830
Speaker 0: Yoshi's cookie is if you're going to rank all time puzzle games, right?

698
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:13,800
Speaker 0: The top tier of puzzle games is Tetris.

699
00:38:13,840 --> 00:38:27,296
Speaker 0: Of course is number one, battle balls, magical drop and a penalty pond, which is also known as Pokemon puzzle league, also known as, you level is not Yoshi's cookie.

700
00:38:27,778 --> 00:38:33,460
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess you could also maybe put bust a move slash, you know, uh, whatever you want to call it in that top level.

701
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:33,701
Speaker 0: ish.

702
00:38:34,123 --> 00:38:38,862
Speaker 0: The second level Yoshi's cookie right there, right under that level is Yoshi's cookie.

703
00:38:39,304 --> 00:38:48,199
Speaker 0: I just, for some reason now I respect and also on that level, regular Yoshi, Scott, you forgot to know there was a game talk to Mario's in the top level.

704
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:55,548
Speaker 1: So here's what I think is going on with this game because our friends were into battle balls and that was their thing.

705
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:59,805
Speaker 1: Like we have a few friends who are transcendent gods at battle balls.

706
00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:01,411
Speaker 1: They make us look like a little babies.

707
00:39:01,974 --> 00:39:03,038
Speaker 1: that was just their game.

708
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,512
Speaker 1: If they had not pulled us into that game, we would never have played it.

709
00:39:06,773 --> 00:39:07,837
Speaker 1: I probably wouldn't have even liked it.

710
00:39:08,962 --> 00:39:15,011
Speaker 1: Yoshi's cookie is just your gem fire or your battle balls, but you don't have a bunch of other people who will play it with you.

711
00:39:15,031 --> 00:39:17,945
Speaker 0: It's cause you afraid to play it with me.

712
00:39:17,985 --> 00:39:18,347
Speaker 0: I'll just kill you.

713
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:18,930
Speaker 1: I played it with you.

714
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:21,159
Speaker 1: I just didn't, it didn't have a good brain feel.

715
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:25,277
Speaker 1: The kind of puzzle that it is does not give my brain good feelings.

716
00:39:25,860 --> 00:39:27,146
Speaker 0: Well, I like Yoshi's cookie.

717
00:39:27,206 --> 00:39:36,362
Speaker 0: Basically the way it works is you have cookies in a grid, a square rectangular grid, and you can move any row or column of cookies left or right or up or down if it's a column.

718
00:39:36,402 --> 00:39:36,603
Speaker 0: Right?

719
00:39:36,985 --> 00:39:40,001
Speaker 0: And when you move the cookies sort of go to the other side like Pac-Man.

720
00:39:40,021 --> 00:39:45,490
Speaker 0: So if you move a column to the right, every cookie goes to the right one space and the right most cookie teleports to the left side.

721
00:39:46,491 --> 00:39:52,035
Speaker 0: You have to line up a complete row or column of identical cookies and there's different cookie shapes, right?

722
00:39:52,055 --> 00:39:55,311
Speaker 0: There's like the checkerboard cookie, the flower cookie, the donut cookie, right?

723
00:39:55,331 --> 00:39:56,075
Speaker 0: So on and so forth.

724
00:39:56,577 --> 00:40:01,664
Speaker 0: And when you line up a row of cookies that are all the same shape, they clear away like Tetris and the cookies collapse.

725
00:40:02,146 --> 00:40:05,023
Speaker 0: and you got to clear the cookies away completely to go to the next level.

726
00:40:05,044 --> 00:40:06,070
Speaker 0: Why is Yoshi eating these cookies?

727
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:08,075
Speaker 1: When did he ever have, he has no history of cookies.

728
00:40:08,095 --> 00:40:09,620
Speaker 0: Mario is baking the cookies.

729
00:40:09,941 --> 00:40:18,245
Speaker 0: Yoshi's berries anyway, they're like a multiplayer version.

730
00:40:18,265 --> 00:40:25,812
Speaker 0: The way it works is both players have a complete grid of cookies that is the same size that constantly is full of cookies no matter what.

731
00:40:26,615 --> 00:40:36,031
Speaker 0: But when you clear a line, right, you're basically, you know, working your way towards the limit of whoever clears the most lines when sort of like magical drop, right?

732
00:40:36,071 --> 00:40:41,050
Speaker 0: If you reach the number first, you win, but you can get a row of Yoshi head cookies.

733
00:40:41,251 --> 00:40:45,291
Speaker 0: If you get a row of Yoshi head cookies in the single player, Yoshi head cookies are wild.

734
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:51,468
Speaker 0: In the multiplayer, the Yoshi head cookies, you want to make a line of them.

735
00:40:51,869 --> 00:40:54,840
Speaker 0: And if you do that, you'll activate the superpower.

736
00:40:55,021 --> 00:40:58,595
Speaker 0: And the superpowers are basically constantly rotating on top of your screen.

737
00:40:58,916 --> 00:41:07,812
Speaker 0: So each player has this sort of little spot on their side of the board that tells you what power will activate if you were to line up five Yoshi cookies right now.

738
00:41:08,756 --> 00:41:10,724
Speaker 0: So that thing is changing all the time.

739
00:41:10,744 --> 00:41:22,255
Speaker 0: So what you have to do is if you get five Yoshi cookies, you got to line them up and you have to wait for that power to be exactly a good power that's going to hurt your opponent and then hit the Yoshi cookies quickly before it changes.

740
00:41:22,296 --> 00:41:24,265
Speaker 0: And some of those things will help you.

741
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:25,854
Speaker 0: And some of those things will hurt you.

742
00:41:25,915 --> 00:41:27,265
Speaker 0: And some of those things will hurt your opponent.

743
00:41:27,346 --> 00:41:28,553
Speaker 0: Some of those things will help your opponent.

744
00:41:28,574 --> 00:41:33,879
Speaker 0: So you have to be really careful not to, like, help your opponent or hurt yourself when you trigger the Yoshi cookies.

745
00:41:34,803 --> 00:41:40,304
Speaker 0: And that's pretty interesting kind of mechanic that no other puzzle game really has of the timing being necessary.

746
00:41:40,344 --> 00:41:40,746
Speaker 0: You can't.

747
00:41:40,766 --> 00:41:44,500
Speaker 1: So the Tetris on the DS had the several wasn't?

748
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,524
Speaker 1: the power is different.

749
00:41:45,925 --> 00:41:47,973
Speaker 1: It was that choosing choosing the opponent.

750
00:41:48,033 --> 00:41:48,957
Speaker 0: Yes, that's correct.

751
00:41:48,977 --> 00:41:50,523
Speaker 0: But there's only one opponent Yoshi's cookie.

752
00:41:51,829 --> 00:41:54,260
Speaker 0: But it has that timing element of, you know, you.

753
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:57,413
Speaker 0: it's not just if you can't just clear really, really fast to win that.

754
00:41:57,433 --> 00:41:58,818
Speaker 0: That's a valid strategy.

755
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:03,698
Speaker 0: But the other person waits like 10 seconds, they'll be able to really crush you.

756
00:42:03,758 --> 00:42:09,308
Speaker 0: And some of the abilities you can activate are like minus the other dude's score or plus your score a whole bunch.

757
00:42:09,368 --> 00:42:10,733
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, fuck, right?

758
00:42:10,753 --> 00:42:16,835
Speaker 1: I guess I just I. for some reason, the kind of puzzle this is just never jive with me and I did enjoy it.

759
00:42:17,157 --> 00:42:22,160
Speaker 1: And also, I just point out Nintendo Power, the Game Boy version got a three point four out of five in the surveys.

760
00:42:22,883 --> 00:42:26,217
Speaker 1: And the SNES version got a three point three to five out of five.

761
00:42:26,277 --> 00:42:27,402
Speaker 0: I played the NES version.

762
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:30,353
Speaker 1: I don't think there was an NES version, Scott.

763
00:42:30,393 --> 00:42:31,818
Speaker 1: There was.

764
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:32,521
Speaker 0: I owned it.

765
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:33,785
Speaker 0: Don't tell me it didn't exist here.

766
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:35,793
Speaker 0: What the fuck is wrong with you?

767
00:42:36,255 --> 00:42:36,497
Speaker 0: All right.

768
00:42:36,537 --> 00:42:37,521
Speaker 0: So another game.

769
00:42:37,923 --> 00:42:39,068
Speaker 0: People don't talk about it.

770
00:42:39,169 --> 00:42:40,754
Speaker 0: all those on the NES that I loved.

771
00:42:41,436 --> 00:42:42,459
Speaker 0: Kung Fu Heroes.

772
00:42:43,401 --> 00:42:44,384
Speaker 0: Do you even know that game room?

773
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:46,310
Speaker 1: I think so.

774
00:42:46,370 --> 00:42:53,140
Speaker 1: Is that the game where you're two Kung Fu dudes in this like side view, walking around on a grid, punching, kicking the shit out of people?

775
00:42:53,622 --> 00:42:54,366
Speaker 0: Yeah.

776
00:42:54,486 --> 00:42:55,049
Speaker 1: I know this game.

777
00:42:55,069 --> 00:42:55,813
Speaker 1: The game is awesome.

778
00:42:55,873 --> 00:42:56,175
Speaker 0: Yeah.

779
00:42:56,336 --> 00:43:01,482
Speaker 0: So the thing with this game is it's pretty much every screen is just a square and you can't really scroll at all.

780
00:43:01,502 --> 00:43:06,044
Speaker 0: It's you're on this one square and you to beat all the guys in order to open up the door to go to the next screen.

781
00:43:06,828 --> 00:43:12,918
Speaker 0: But there's so many secrets and crazy shit and you can do like these jumps, spinning cakes and get all these abilities and weapons.

782
00:43:13,481 --> 00:43:30,473
Speaker 0: And it's one of those games like everything just feels so weird and sort of, you know, it's like the craziest shit happens, like you'll punch a block and a letter P will come out and you'll punch it and a door will open like a staircase and you go in the staircase and it takes you to another world where you play a bonus game with bullets flying.

783
00:43:30,493 --> 00:43:38,561
Speaker 0: And it's just totally this wacky, very Japanese kind of game, you know, that doesn't really, you know, I was amazed.

784
00:43:38,601 --> 00:43:40,108
Speaker 0: it came over to the US at all.

785
00:43:40,469 --> 00:43:41,574
Speaker 0: It had really good music.

786
00:43:41,655 --> 00:43:46,295
Speaker 0: It was co-op, really fun to play with a friend, really fun to discover all the secrets and warps.

787
00:43:46,577 --> 00:43:54,908
Speaker 0: The bosses are really crazy, like these big red monsters that look like the guy from, you know, the Bugs Bunny cartoons, the big red guy.

788
00:43:54,928 --> 00:43:55,731
Speaker 0: Right now.

789
00:43:55,832 --> 00:43:57,519
Speaker 1: I remember, I can't remember the title of it.

790
00:43:57,540 --> 00:44:00,955
Speaker 1: There was a similar game that was more like an RPG.

791
00:44:01,517 --> 00:44:04,067
Speaker 0: Ah, I actually discovered this today during my research.

792
00:44:04,247 --> 00:44:04,930
Speaker 1: What was it called?

793
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:11,936
Speaker 0: There is a game for the Nintendo entertainment system that was in fact a sequel to this that I did not know existed in the game.

794
00:44:11,956 --> 00:44:16,072
Speaker 0: I knew that had RPG elements called little ninja brothers.

795
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:16,534
Speaker 0: That's it.

796
00:44:16,655 --> 00:44:17,057
Speaker 1: That's it.

797
00:44:17,318 --> 00:44:22,824
Speaker 1: Because I remember I did not know little ninja brothers existed before today getting the sword because you got the sword.

798
00:44:22,844 --> 00:44:28,727
Speaker 1: It was basically the baddest ass thing to have, but you didn't get XP for anyone you killed with it.

799
00:44:28,827 --> 00:44:36,897
Speaker 0: There was also a Super Nintendo game called Super Ninja Boy, which was the third game in the series that I never knew existed before today.

800
00:44:37,599 --> 00:44:43,521
Speaker 0: So the first game in the series, though Kung Fu Heroes definitely has really good styling.

801
00:44:43,902 --> 00:44:45,006
Speaker 0: I really love that game.

802
00:44:45,047 --> 00:44:47,599
Speaker 1: My little brother and I played the shit out of little ninja brothers.

803
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:51,241
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is one of those games where it's like, you know, and there'll be some other games like it.

804
00:44:51,261 --> 00:44:52,207
Speaker 0: I talk about where it's like.

805
00:44:52,248 --> 00:44:53,636
Speaker 0: we bought it when we had an NES.

806
00:44:53,677 --> 00:44:58,461
Speaker 0: We didn't know we were getting into and we lucked out with something good, not like the time about Wayne Gretzky hockey.

807
00:44:58,481 --> 00:45:01,254
Speaker 0: And it was shit even worse than ice hockey.

808
00:45:01,354 --> 00:45:03,203
Speaker 0: Wayne Gretzky hockey for the N64 is great.

809
00:45:03,223 --> 00:45:05,333
Speaker 0: And talking about NES Wayne Gretzky hockey, it's awful.

810
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:06,257
Speaker 0: All right.

811
00:45:06,298 --> 00:45:07,644
Speaker 0: So rim loves Dig Dug, right?

812
00:45:07,945 --> 00:45:08,568
Speaker 1: I like Dig Dug.

813
00:45:08,588 --> 00:45:09,432
Speaker 0: You like Dig Dug two.

814
00:45:09,713 --> 00:45:10,256
Speaker 1: It's OK.

815
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,742
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like Dig Dug two a lot.

816
00:45:11,783 --> 00:45:12,546
Speaker 0: I had Dig Dug two.

817
00:45:12,627 --> 00:45:14,495
Speaker 0: I played more Dig Dug two than Dig Dug one.

818
00:45:15,338 --> 00:45:19,074
Speaker 0: So the way Dig Dug two works is Dig Dug is on an island walking around on the surface.

819
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:19,636
Speaker 0: Right.

820
00:45:20,339 --> 00:45:22,126
Speaker 0: And so are the pookas and the figures.

821
00:45:22,608 --> 00:45:24,455
Speaker 0: And they are up to their usual shenanigans.

822
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:33,248
Speaker 0: But Dig Dug on the surface, he can dig, but he can only dig in a straight line, basically making sort of faults like the San Andreas fault.

823
00:45:33,750 --> 00:45:37,890
Speaker 0: And he can only start digging a San Andreas fault at a spot where there is a stick in the ground.

824
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:41,181
Speaker 0: Sometimes there's already faults already in this island.

825
00:45:41,804 --> 00:45:45,358
Speaker 0: And what happens is, let's say he completely cuts off a piece of the island.

826
00:45:46,402 --> 00:45:53,070
Speaker 0: Well, obviously, that no matter what that means, you have divided the island into two pieces, not to equal pieces, but two pieces.

827
00:45:53,771 --> 00:46:03,912
Speaker 0: And when Dig Dug divides the island into two pieces with a fault line, one part of the island sinks into the ocean and all the pookas and figures on that part of the island will die.

828
00:46:04,413 --> 00:46:07,425
Speaker 0: But it's the smaller piece that falls into the ocean.

829
00:46:07,666 --> 00:46:11,963
Speaker 0: And a lot of times Dig Dug will fuck himself by falling into the ocean.

830
00:46:11,983 --> 00:46:15,298
Speaker 0: And the pookas and the fire guys will laugh at him from the still floating island.

831
00:46:15,318 --> 00:46:21,104
Speaker 1: I remember they'll like throw themselves into the sea and commit suicide if you don't kill them all in time.

832
00:46:21,225 --> 00:46:21,888
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is true.

833
00:46:21,928 --> 00:46:25,664
Speaker 0: You can also use the classic pumping gun to kill them because it's Dig Dug.

834
00:46:25,765 --> 00:46:26,769
Speaker 1: Thing is, the game is OK.

835
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:28,597
Speaker 1: Just what you get is Dig Dug.

836
00:46:28,678 --> 00:46:33,880
Speaker 0: You keep playing this game, though, and it gets really hard and really shows Dig Dug way trick.

837
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:36,009
Speaker 0: You know, Dig Dug just really gets faster and doesn't.

838
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:40,290
Speaker 0: This really has a lot of variety in the island layouts as they get bigger and bigger with more.

839
00:46:40,310 --> 00:46:41,376
Speaker 0: There's only thirty one.

840
00:46:42,139 --> 00:46:42,561
Speaker 1: Really?

841
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:46,478
Speaker 1: After level thirty one, the levels have the same layout as the one sixteen levels before it.

842
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:49,350
Speaker 0: But that means I almost beat this as a kid.

843
00:46:49,410 --> 00:46:51,881
Speaker 0: I was only able to get to level like eighteen, nineteen, twenty.

844
00:46:51,962 --> 00:46:54,595
Speaker 0: There's only thirty one unique levels.

845
00:46:54,716 --> 00:46:56,024
Speaker 0: I didn't realize I was that close to winning.

846
00:46:56,045 --> 00:46:56,447
Speaker 0: You don't win.

847
00:46:56,508 --> 00:46:57,331
Speaker 1: It just keeps going.

848
00:46:57,532 --> 00:46:58,395
Speaker 0: Give a shit anyway.

849
00:46:58,916 --> 00:46:59,237
Speaker 0: All right.

850
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:04,013
Speaker 0: Other NES games that I bought, not really knowing what to expect.

851
00:47:04,053 --> 00:47:05,096
Speaker 0: That turned out to be amazing.

852
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:06,621
Speaker 0: Alfred Chicken.

853
00:47:06,642 --> 00:47:09,572
Speaker 1: No, I never liked Alfred Chicken.

854
00:47:09,592 --> 00:47:10,799
Speaker 0: Why don't you like Albert Chicken?

855
00:47:11,121 --> 00:47:11,463
Speaker 1: I don't know.

856
00:47:11,503 --> 00:47:12,227
Speaker 1: I just didn't like it.

857
00:47:12,509 --> 00:47:15,341
Speaker 0: Albert Chicken was a bet was like the original.

858
00:47:15,462 --> 00:47:22,650
Speaker 0: I know it was the original puzzle platformer, but it was way more puzzle platforming than any other game I had played up to that point.

859
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:23,313
Speaker 0: Right.

860
00:47:23,333 --> 00:47:26,870
Speaker 0: You needed some platforming skills to jump and dive and avoid getting killed.

861
00:47:27,531 --> 00:47:32,610
Speaker 0: But really, a lot of the puzzle platform games that exist today owe a lot to Alfred Chicken.

862
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:36,412
Speaker 0: It's like you had to look at where you were and figure out, like, how the hell can I get through here?

863
00:47:36,432 --> 00:47:37,276
Speaker 0: Right.

864
00:47:37,477 --> 00:47:40,068
Speaker 0: And it wasn't just, you know, run and jump with good timing.

865
00:47:40,089 --> 00:47:40,913
Speaker 1: I will say it was.

866
00:47:41,134 --> 00:47:43,546
Speaker 1: I think it was a better game than like the old Duke Nukem's.

867
00:47:43,827 --> 00:47:44,028
Speaker 0: Yeah.

868
00:47:44,088 --> 00:47:46,883
Speaker 0: The other thing with Alfred Chicken is that I don't know, was there?

869
00:47:46,903 --> 00:47:52,621
Speaker 0: there was a Game Boy version, but the Game Boy, SNES, Super Game Boy, Amiga, Amiga CD 32.

870
00:47:52,621 --> 00:47:52,862
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

871
00:47:52,982 --> 00:47:53,183
Speaker 0: And yes.

872
00:47:53,203 --> 00:48:01,855
Speaker 0: But anyway, the NES and SNES versions, which came out at the same time, usually back in the day if that happened.

873
00:48:01,875 --> 00:48:05,651
Speaker 1: Apparently the NES version was just a gimped version of the Game Boy one.

874
00:48:05,992 --> 00:48:06,293
Speaker 0: Was it?

875
00:48:06,454 --> 00:48:06,795
Speaker 1: Yeah.

876
00:48:07,597 --> 00:48:08,661
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm reading Wikipedia.

877
00:48:08,681 --> 00:48:10,346
Speaker 1: So why?

878
00:48:10,486 --> 00:48:15,764
Speaker 0: But what I'm telling you is that the NES and SNES versions were basically completely different games.

879
00:48:15,905 --> 00:48:21,994
Speaker 0: It wasn't like the same game and just like reduced graphics, reduced sound, which you saw a lot of the time, for example, with Yoshi's Cookie.

880
00:48:22,195 --> 00:48:22,335
Speaker 0: Right.

881
00:48:22,375 --> 00:48:26,033
Speaker 0: The NES and SNES versions of Yoshi's Cookie were almost the same game.

882
00:48:26,093 --> 00:48:29,470
Speaker 0: Just one was looking like an NES game and one is looking like an SNES game.

883
00:48:29,932 --> 00:48:33,207
Speaker 0: The NES and SNES Alfred Chickens are actually two different games.

884
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,739
Speaker 0: You might as well call them Alfred Chicken one, Alfred Chicken two.

885
00:48:36,041 --> 00:48:37,589
Speaker 0: If you like one, you should play both.

886
00:48:37,609 --> 00:48:42,712
Speaker 1: Well, according to Wikipedia, the NES version is essentially a watered down port of the Game Boy version.

887
00:48:42,732 --> 00:48:44,038
Speaker 1: It features only five levels.

888
00:48:44,741 --> 00:48:45,143
Speaker 0: Really?

889
00:48:45,264 --> 00:48:47,192
Speaker 0: So the Game Boy version is more than five levels?

890
00:48:47,232 --> 00:48:47,534
Speaker 0: Yes.

891
00:48:47,775 --> 00:48:49,703
Speaker 0: But it's the same five levels as the NES one?

892
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:50,004
Speaker 0: Yep.

893
00:48:50,386 --> 00:48:52,656
Speaker 1: So the NES one is the worst version ever made.

894
00:48:53,299 --> 00:48:56,252
Speaker 0: But at least the NES one that has color and such that the Game Boy one doesn't.

895
00:48:56,694 --> 00:48:57,617
Speaker 0: The NES one is the one.

896
00:48:57,638 --> 00:48:58,882
Speaker 1: Super Game Boy one, too.

897
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,388
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

898
00:49:00,609 --> 00:49:02,699
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of info on the Wikipedia page.

899
00:49:03,061 --> 00:49:04,749
Speaker 0: I kind of want to play that Game Boy one now.

900
00:49:04,769 --> 00:49:06,696
Speaker 1: It was designed by Jason McGann.

901
00:49:07,058 --> 00:49:07,800
Speaker 0: OK, what's he up to?

902
00:49:08,463 --> 00:49:08,683
Speaker 1: There's.

903
00:49:08,744 --> 00:49:10,430
Speaker 1: no he is not a notable person.

904
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:12,337
Speaker 1: OK, so I can't click on his name.

905
00:49:12,538 --> 00:49:12,759
Speaker 0: Yeah.

906
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:16,818
Speaker 0: Alfred Chicken, a game that no one really remembers that actually has a lot going on.

907
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:21,380
Speaker 0: I mean, this game was good enough to basically be published at that time in the 16 bit era.

908
00:49:21,702 --> 00:49:21,862
Speaker 0: Right.

909
00:49:21,903 --> 00:49:24,956
Speaker 0: And all three of those systems coming out of basically nowhere.

910
00:49:25,277 --> 00:49:26,141
Speaker 0: Right.

911
00:49:26,241 --> 00:49:27,908
Speaker 1: It's a feat that it was published legit.

912
00:49:27,928 --> 00:49:29,477
Speaker 1: It wasn't like one of those crazy Bible games.

913
00:49:29,497 --> 00:49:29,638
Speaker 0: Yeah.

914
00:49:29,658 --> 00:49:32,714
Speaker 0: The publishers like played this game and said, wow, this is really fun.

915
00:49:32,755 --> 00:49:39,003
Speaker 0: Well, some thought, yeah, they believe someone believe some of the money believe this could be like a new franchise.

916
00:49:39,023 --> 00:49:40,610
Speaker 0: They marketed it like quite heavily.

917
00:49:40,650 --> 00:49:41,778
Speaker 0: It's the only reason I even heard of it.

918
00:49:41,798 --> 00:49:41,939
Speaker 0: Right.

919
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:47,388
Speaker 0: It was in all the video game magazines with ads, even though the game magazines themselves mostly ignored it in their reviews.

920
00:49:47,428 --> 00:49:48,191
Speaker 0: They took ads.

921
00:49:48,232 --> 00:49:48,995
Speaker 1: I'll bet what it was.

922
00:49:49,016 --> 00:49:53,637
Speaker 1: I remember Sunsoft being very good at picking the right games to port and good games to make.

923
00:49:54,279 --> 00:49:58,155
Speaker 1: And Sunsoft probably was like, hey, this game on the Amiga or whatever is great.

924
00:49:58,537 --> 00:49:59,924
Speaker 1: Let's get it on the Nintendos.

925
00:49:59,944 --> 00:50:00,245
Speaker 0: All right.

926
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:01,954
Speaker 0: So let's hurry up with the rest of these here.

927
00:50:02,034 --> 00:50:02,235
Speaker 0: Right.

928
00:50:02,375 --> 00:50:03,038
Speaker 1: Even a lot.

929
00:50:03,239 --> 00:50:03,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a lot of them.

930
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:07,119
Speaker 0: So my friend had, you know, you go to a friend's house.

931
00:50:07,139 --> 00:50:08,226
Speaker 0: They had a bunch of games.

932
00:50:08,266 --> 00:50:09,755
Speaker 0: They always have weird ones that you didn't have.

933
00:50:09,795 --> 00:50:10,881
Speaker 1: That's how I learned about Dr.

934
00:50:10,901 --> 00:50:11,344
Speaker 1: Chaos.

935
00:50:11,565 --> 00:50:12,731
Speaker 0: I was about to talk about Dr.

936
00:50:12,771 --> 00:50:13,233
Speaker 0: Chaos.

937
00:50:13,394 --> 00:50:13,896
Speaker 0: What really?

938
00:50:14,076 --> 00:50:14,418
Speaker 0: Yes.

939
00:50:15,241 --> 00:50:16,787
Speaker 0: My friends, they had this game called Dr.

940
00:50:16,827 --> 00:50:17,168
Speaker 0: Chaos.

941
00:50:17,209 --> 00:50:17,751
Speaker 0: You played it.

942
00:50:17,771 --> 00:50:19,178
Speaker 0: And I was like, whoa, what the hell is.

943
00:50:19,278 --> 00:50:21,348
Speaker 1: as my little brother and I said, Dr.

944
00:50:21,368 --> 00:50:22,331
Speaker 1: Charles, Dr.

945
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:24,379
Speaker 0: Charles, this is a great game.

946
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,302
Speaker 0: It's really unique.

947
00:50:25,624 --> 00:50:26,086
Speaker 0: You go.

948
00:50:26,206 --> 00:50:28,375
Speaker 0: You're basically your crazy old uncle, Dr.

949
00:50:28,415 --> 00:50:28,898
Speaker 0: Chaos.

950
00:50:29,038 --> 00:50:30,445
Speaker 0: He needs you to watch his mansion.

951
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:31,007
Speaker 0: You get there.

952
00:50:31,047 --> 00:50:31,590
Speaker 0: He's not there.

953
00:50:31,650 --> 00:50:34,142
Speaker 0: It's filled with monsters and it has two games.

954
00:50:34,182 --> 00:50:38,220
Speaker 0: This is a game where you walk around the mansion sort of doing a deja vu, trying to find stuff.

955
00:50:38,662 --> 00:50:46,199
Speaker 0: And at the same time, we're trying to find these secret portals in the mansion to take you to the side scrolling levels where you have to fight the evil monsters.

956
00:50:46,219 --> 00:50:51,266
Speaker 0: And when you beat all the side scrolling levels and get all the pieces to these machines and things, then I guess you win.

957
00:50:51,286 --> 00:50:52,572
Speaker 0: I've never gotten very far at all.

958
00:50:52,633 --> 00:51:00,145
Speaker 0: It's really hard to find the side scrolling levels, but even the mansion part and the exploring and like punching the walls to find secrets is really fun.

959
00:51:00,165 --> 00:51:03,901
Speaker 1: As opposed to a mile on secret castle, you should try.

960
00:51:03,961 --> 00:51:05,226
Speaker 0: You don't have to beat Dr.

961
00:51:05,267 --> 00:51:05,668
Speaker 0: Chaos.

962
00:51:05,709 --> 00:51:11,636
Speaker 0: Just like load it up in your NES emulator and poke around and you'll see like this is a game that there is no other game like that.

963
00:51:11,717 --> 00:51:17,945
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember because I didn't play it until I was at my friend's house, but I'd always go to the video rental store and I'd see Dr.

964
00:51:17,985 --> 00:51:22,642
Speaker 1: Chaos right next to that desert combat NES game that was basically advanced wars.

965
00:51:23,325 --> 00:51:25,614
Speaker 1: And I remember standing looking at Dr.

966
00:51:25,634 --> 00:51:28,689
Speaker 1: Chaos because there's this skull and this demon and all this blood.

967
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:29,513
Speaker 1: I'm like, that looks fun.

968
00:51:29,976 --> 00:51:32,950
Speaker 1: But then the advanced one, I was like, ooh, military simulation.

969
00:51:34,010 --> 00:51:36,742
Speaker 0: So a metal Marines, I think we've talked about metal Marines.

970
00:51:36,762 --> 00:51:39,274
Speaker 1: We talked about metal Marines at packs.

971
00:51:39,375 --> 00:51:39,717
Speaker 0: Yeah.

972
00:51:39,958 --> 00:51:42,953
Speaker 0: So I don't want to say too much about it other than I just want to bring it up again.

973
00:51:43,274 --> 00:51:45,943
Speaker 1: Every level past the second one in metal Marine sucks ass.

974
00:51:46,946 --> 00:51:47,368
Speaker 0: Okay.

975
00:51:47,628 --> 00:51:50,917
Speaker 0: But the concept of metal Marines is the best.

976
00:51:51,559 --> 00:51:52,842
Speaker 1: It's a great game.

977
00:51:52,862 --> 00:51:59,689
Speaker 1: They just didn't execute on it beyond the console and there's the windows 3.1 version, but yeah, metal Marines.

978
00:51:59,729 --> 00:52:00,352
Speaker 0: Don't forget metal.

979
00:52:00,372 --> 00:52:01,838
Speaker 1: I have that laying around somewhere.

980
00:52:02,159 --> 00:52:03,424
Speaker 0: Okay, now let's get real.

981
00:52:03,926 --> 00:52:04,850
Speaker 0: The best game.

982
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:09,810
Speaker 0: I think this is probably, I might even say it might even be the best side scrolling platformer there.

983
00:52:10,111 --> 00:52:11,356
Speaker 0: Oh, super Mario world.

984
00:52:11,376 --> 00:52:12,158
Speaker 1: Legacy of the wizard.

985
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:12,861
Speaker 1: No.

986
00:52:12,981 --> 00:52:14,326
Speaker 1: Okay.

987
00:52:14,406 --> 00:52:23,087
Speaker 0: Maybe a little bit under a super Mario world, but Wario two, one of the best games.

988
00:52:23,127 --> 00:52:24,210
Speaker 0: People don't know this, right?

989
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:27,059
Speaker 0: But on the game boy, there was super Mario land.

990
00:52:27,521 --> 00:52:31,453
Speaker 0: Then there was super Mario land to the six golden coins.

991
00:52:31,534 --> 00:52:35,085
Speaker 0: The boss of which was Wario first appearance of Wario.

992
00:52:35,165 --> 00:52:35,707
Speaker 0: It's me.

993
00:52:35,727 --> 00:52:44,890
Speaker 0: Then there was a game on the game boy called super Mario land three Wario land and you played as Wario.

994
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:52,895
Speaker 0: Then there was a game Wario land to where you played as Wario and basically the super Mario land series.

995
00:52:53,155 --> 00:53:05,090
Speaker 0: Once that boss of that second, you know, Mario game was Wario turned into Wario land and Wario land two is the best because what it does is it sort of has.

996
00:53:05,130 --> 00:53:08,662
Speaker 0: this revolutionary thing of Wario is invincible.

997
00:53:08,722 --> 00:53:12,736
Speaker 0: He wasn't invincible in Wario one that only defined his greed for coins.

998
00:53:13,218 --> 00:53:14,864
Speaker 0: Wario land two, he's invincible.

999
00:53:14,905 --> 00:53:17,997
Speaker 0: So it's all about trying to get through the level.

1000
00:53:18,218 --> 00:53:22,799
Speaker 0: We're finding all the secrets, beating it, you know, and beating a boss, but you can't die.

1001
00:53:22,920 --> 00:53:27,846
Speaker 0: All that can really happen to you is you can eat your ass kicked back and have to run through a spot again because you failed.

1002
00:53:27,926 --> 00:53:28,871
Speaker 0: It's like you fall in a pit.

1003
00:53:28,891 --> 00:53:29,514
Speaker 0: You don't die.

1004
00:53:30,017 --> 00:53:30,901
Speaker 0: You just have to go back.

1005
00:53:31,263 --> 00:53:34,601
Speaker 0: And a lot of times going back doesn't keep you from beating the level like annoying.

1006
00:53:34,621 --> 00:53:36,793
Speaker 0: It's like if you want to beat the level, it's really easy.

1007
00:53:37,214 --> 00:53:46,414
Speaker 0: But if you want to get all the treasures and unlock all the goodies, you have to be able to, like, you'll see these incredibly difficult, you know, secrecy filled parts of levels.

1008
00:53:46,615 --> 00:53:49,608
Speaker 1: There are lots of weird things to find an unlock in this game.

1009
00:53:49,648 --> 00:54:00,934
Speaker 0: And also when you've beat the game, it starts over and it has a sort of a Wario land plus mode where you suddenly see this, you know, the path you took to beat the game and you see all these other levels.

1010
00:54:00,974 --> 00:54:04,410
Speaker 0: you didn't go because you didn't find secret exits in previous levels.

1011
00:54:04,831 --> 00:54:10,074
Speaker 0: And there's five different endings as a ton of endings and different paths to take to ends and different.

1012
00:54:10,154 --> 00:54:10,395
Speaker 0: Right.

1013
00:54:10,436 --> 00:54:12,806
Speaker 0: So this game is tons of playable value.

1014
00:54:13,067 --> 00:54:16,426
Speaker 0: And it's not only can you beat all the levels, like, can you get the treasure in every level?

1015
00:54:16,768 --> 00:54:16,909
Speaker 0: Right.

1016
00:54:16,950 --> 00:54:20,864
Speaker 0: You see a lot of things today, like in Super Mario Brothers, we or whatever.

1017
00:54:20,924 --> 00:54:30,198
Speaker 0: It's like or well, there's the Mario Land, the 3D one, the game, the 3DS one or the DS one, the Mario one, the new Super Mario Brothers for the DS.

1018
00:54:31,062 --> 00:54:33,250
Speaker 0: And it's like get the big gold coin in every level.

1019
00:54:33,830 --> 00:54:35,419
Speaker 0: Wario Land is where that shit came from.

1020
00:54:35,821 --> 00:54:36,022
Speaker 0: Right.

1021
00:54:36,062 --> 00:54:37,028
Speaker 0: This is where that game from.

1022
00:54:37,068 --> 00:54:43,980
Speaker 0: Can you get the treasure in every level, which involves not only finding the treasure chest, but beating the treasure chest in his little treasure chest game.

1023
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:46,450
Speaker 0: OK, also, let's just do this quickly.

1024
00:54:46,850 --> 00:54:49,844
Speaker 0: Mario Kart Super Circuit, the Game Boy Advance Mario Kart.

1025
00:54:49,945 --> 00:54:51,050
Speaker 0: I bring this up all the time.

1026
00:54:51,432 --> 00:54:54,123
Speaker 0: It is the least remembered, least cared about Mario Kart.

1027
00:54:54,184 --> 00:54:58,502
Speaker 1: It's also the best Mario Kart because you want a game that is primarily skill.

1028
00:54:58,643 --> 00:55:00,731
Speaker 0: There is still randomness of getting items.

1029
00:55:00,832 --> 00:55:13,877
Speaker 0: But in Super Mario Kart, Super Circuit for the GBA, if you race perfectly, you do you drift every corner, you go at max speed, you never hit a bump, you never go off the road, you never do anything wrong.

1030
00:55:13,897 --> 00:55:15,001
Speaker 0: You drive perfectly.

1031
00:55:15,843 --> 00:55:21,607
Speaker 0: Even the blue shell will hover behind your ass without hitting you as soon as you fuck up a little bit.

1032
00:55:21,668 --> 00:55:21,889
Speaker 0: Boom.

1033
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:23,234
Speaker 0: It goes faster than you and hits you.

1034
00:55:23,676 --> 00:55:30,768
Speaker 0: But if you drive perfectly in this Mario Kart, even the blue shell or the red shell will just stay behind you waiting for you to fuck up.

1035
00:55:31,150 --> 00:55:35,350
Speaker 0: And if you go long enough without fucking up, the shell will give up and fall off the screen.

1036
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:39,653
Speaker 0: And then you can get red shells and shoot them backwards at your opponents and they're and they're fucked.

1037
00:55:40,054 --> 00:55:41,902
Speaker 0: So first place means first place.

1038
00:55:42,002 --> 00:55:44,652
Speaker 0: It's mostly a racing game as opposed to the other ones.

1039
00:55:45,114 --> 00:55:52,262
Speaker 0: And it has almost all the tracks from the original Mario Kart, as well as lots of additional tracks only in this one.

1040
00:55:52,403 --> 00:55:53,669
Speaker 1: It is that good multiplayer.

1041
00:55:53,689 --> 00:55:56,564
Speaker 1: I mean, it was one of the first games to really use those GBA link cables.

1042
00:55:56,725 --> 00:55:59,098
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean, it was pretty much the first game came out.

1043
00:55:59,339 --> 00:56:03,077
Speaker 1: I remember hanging out at Luke's fucking apartment with a bunch of GBA is playing.

1044
00:56:03,118 --> 00:56:10,212
Speaker 0: They came out very close to the release of the Game Boy Advance and link cable and was like the thing was the first game to use the four way link cable.

1045
00:56:10,574 --> 00:56:11,196
Speaker 0: So, yeah, really good.

1046
00:56:11,276 --> 00:56:11,497
Speaker 0: OK.

1047
00:56:12,079 --> 00:56:18,024
Speaker 0: Conquest of the Crystal Palace is an old NES game where you basically climb up a mountain fighting bad guys and it's kind of hard.

1048
00:56:18,045 --> 00:56:21,257
Speaker 0: You it sort of has some RPG elements to it.

1049
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:29,705
Speaker 0: At the beginning, you can choose one of three orbs to get magical powers and it's sort of got this weird thing combining like it's very Japanese.

1050
00:56:29,725 --> 00:56:39,210
Speaker 0: It combines like historical things because it seems like, you know, you're in ancient times fighting ancient monsters and then like some girl gives a news report and sells you items and shit.

1051
00:56:39,411 --> 00:56:39,631
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1052
00:56:39,913 --> 00:56:40,053
Speaker 0: Right.

1053
00:56:40,093 --> 00:56:40,836
Speaker 0: That's all modern.

1054
00:56:41,278 --> 00:56:43,889
Speaker 0: It's pretty hard, but not Silver Surfer hard.

1055
00:56:43,949 --> 00:56:44,974
Speaker 0: It's like on that border.

1056
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:47,425
Speaker 1: I rented it and never really got very far.

1057
00:56:47,446 --> 00:56:49,074
Speaker 0: I borrowed it from someone and played it a whole bunch.

1058
00:56:49,336 --> 00:56:54,603
Speaker 0: The thing that makes this game really great are the bosses, which are like these gigantic NES bosses that you have to fight.

1059
00:56:54,965 --> 00:56:56,672
Speaker 0: Really cool and lots of fun items to get.

1060
00:56:57,636 --> 00:57:02,957
Speaker 0: Legacy of the Wizard already mentioned your whole family to go dungeon crawling to find the secret.

1061
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:08,621
Speaker 0: It really the thing that's great about Legacy of the Wizard is just how it is really big dungeon.

1062
00:57:08,661 --> 00:57:13,945
Speaker 0: And it really feels like sort of epic and mysterious and you know, what kind of crazy shit is going on down there.

1063
00:57:13,985 --> 00:57:16,174
Speaker 0: And you get lots of creepy feels going down.

1064
00:57:16,214 --> 00:57:19,826
Speaker 1: And it's also a really complex game for its time.

1065
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:21,673
Speaker 0: It's not actually that complex.

1066
00:57:21,714 --> 00:57:22,819
Speaker 0: If you read a fact about it.

1067
00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:23,904
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it is a kid.

1068
00:57:24,266 --> 00:57:27,481
Speaker 1: This game, you've got all these characters with all these different power.

1069
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:29,430
Speaker 0: play this game without reading any facts.

1070
00:57:29,610 --> 00:57:31,338
Speaker 0: Read the instruction manual for this game.

1071
00:57:31,901 --> 00:57:35,156
Speaker 1: Six or seven different characters, each with completely unique power.

1072
00:57:35,237 --> 00:57:40,223
Speaker 0: I think there's actually only five characters you can play as I think grandma and grandpa are just like the shop and the so.

1073
00:57:40,264 --> 00:57:40,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right.

1074
00:57:40,988 --> 00:57:41,189
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1075
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:44,605
Speaker 0: One of them is the shop and one or the inventory and one of them is the password.

1076
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:48,926
Speaker 0: But you can play as the dad, the mom, the sister, the brother or the pet.

1077
00:57:48,986 --> 00:57:52,502
Speaker 0: And the pet is the most interesting because he's invincible monsters.

1078
00:57:52,522 --> 00:57:54,552
Speaker 0: Well, he's not invincible, but monsters don't hurt him.

1079
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,070
Speaker 0: So you basically you take the pet and you explore the dungeon and make a map.

1080
00:57:58,611 --> 00:58:05,712
Speaker 0: Then you figure out, OK, I can only go in there if I have the dad who can break rocks and I can only go in there with the daughter who can jump high and I can only go there with the.

1081
00:58:06,214 --> 00:58:06,796
Speaker 0: you know, the girl.

1082
00:58:07,158 --> 00:58:15,157
Speaker 0: I guess I think the mom has the magic and the you know, and then you need the main, you know, the son who can use the magic sword to beat the big dragon once you get the big sort.

1083
00:58:15,197 --> 00:58:15,418
Speaker 0: Right.

1084
00:58:15,740 --> 00:58:17,026
Speaker 0: And you have to figure all this out.

1085
00:58:17,469 --> 00:58:18,011
Speaker 0: It's pretty great.

1086
00:58:18,834 --> 00:58:22,146
Speaker 1: I would say it has a lot of the elements of an early almost Metroidvania.

1087
00:58:22,488 --> 00:58:24,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely before that was a thing.

1088
00:58:24,436 --> 00:58:25,621
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, Metroid existed.

1089
00:58:26,123 --> 00:58:28,875
Speaker 1: But this has the leveling up, getting items more.

1090
00:58:28,935 --> 00:58:31,045
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of leveling up, but there is getting items.

1091
00:58:31,105 --> 00:58:36,983
Speaker 1: This is between Castlevania, Metroidvania, like it's edging in that direction.

1092
00:58:37,003 --> 00:58:40,520
Speaker 0: It's more like it's like roguelike in a little bit in there, too, right?

1093
00:58:40,601 --> 00:58:42,249
Speaker 0: Except it's not procedural.

1094
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:43,013
Speaker 1: You know what I would say?

1095
00:58:43,274 --> 00:58:43,797
Speaker 1: It's a game.

1096
00:58:43,897 --> 00:58:45,506
Speaker 1: If nothing else, play it.

1097
00:58:45,566 --> 00:58:46,872
Speaker 1: And then look at what year it was made.

1098
00:58:46,892 --> 00:58:49,322
Speaker 1: It was just really ahead of its time for what it was.

1099
00:58:50,105 --> 00:58:51,350
Speaker 0: Also, Faxanadoodoo.

1100
00:58:52,412 --> 00:58:53,155
Speaker 1: I hated that game.

1101
00:58:53,235 --> 00:58:53,999
Speaker 0: You hated Faxanadoodoo?

1102
00:58:54,039 --> 00:58:55,124
Speaker 0: I love Faxanadoodoo.

1103
00:58:55,304 --> 00:58:56,409
Speaker 1: I just didn't enjoy it.

1104
00:58:57,091 --> 00:58:59,061
Speaker 0: It's Fazanadoodoo or whatever you want to pronounce it.

1105
00:58:59,101 --> 00:58:59,342
Speaker 0: Right.

1106
00:58:59,382 --> 00:59:04,363
Speaker 0: And it's basically you're this one dude going on this sort of quest fighting evil trolls.

1107
00:59:04,583 --> 00:59:07,475
Speaker 1: I held it and Astyanax like together in my head.

1108
00:59:07,595 --> 00:59:08,861
Speaker 0: Astyanax is not as good.

1109
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:10,609
Speaker 1: I never like Faxanadoodoo.

1110
00:59:10,629 --> 00:59:11,573
Speaker 1: I also never liked the.

1111
00:59:11,814 --> 00:59:15,690
Speaker 1: I think there was the game that looked like Zelda 2, but you were Greek.

1112
00:59:16,830 --> 00:59:18,255
Speaker 1: Battle of Olympus.

1113
00:59:18,395 --> 00:59:18,676
Speaker 0: Oh, that.

1114
00:59:18,736 --> 00:59:19,037
Speaker 0: OK.

1115
00:59:19,178 --> 00:59:20,161
Speaker 1: I hated that game, too.

1116
00:59:20,181 --> 00:59:21,365
Speaker 0: How about Time Lord?

1117
00:59:22,007 --> 00:59:23,933
Speaker 0: Time Lord or Time Lords?

1118
00:59:24,857 --> 00:59:25,038
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1119
00:59:25,078 --> 00:59:26,644
Speaker 0: Time Lord video game for the NES.

1120
00:59:26,884 --> 00:59:28,370
Speaker 0: That's the up Time Lord for NES.

1121
00:59:30,793 --> 00:59:34,382
Speaker 1: Oh, I rented this game once or twice.

1122
00:59:34,402 --> 00:59:35,064
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1123
00:59:35,084 --> 00:59:35,645
Speaker 0: How about that?

1124
00:59:36,087 --> 00:59:37,310
Speaker 1: Never particularly liked it.

1125
00:59:37,650 --> 00:59:44,217
Speaker 0: Anyway, the one game, the last game on my list here that I really want to put some time to talk about is Dynamite Hetty.

1126
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,086
Speaker 0: Nobody who knows Dynamite Hetty.

1127
00:59:47,106 --> 00:59:51,062
Speaker 1: That's the game with the evil cat bear thing.

1128
00:59:51,102 --> 00:59:51,683
Speaker 0: That's right.

1129
00:59:51,703 --> 00:59:52,984
Speaker 0: Trouble Bruin.

1130
00:59:53,124 --> 00:59:53,465
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

1131
00:59:53,505 --> 00:59:54,125
Speaker 0: This game.

1132
00:59:54,386 --> 00:59:54,706
Speaker 0: Get it.

1133
00:59:54,746 --> 01:00:03,295
Speaker 0: Bruin is a game made by Treasure, but people mostly remember Treasure for like Gunstar Heroes and stuff like that.

1134
01:00:03,335 --> 01:00:06,614
Speaker 0: People don't think about Dynamite Hetty when they think about Treasure and the games they've made.

1135
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:11,107
Speaker 0: But Dynamite Hetty is really crazy good.

1136
01:00:11,448 --> 01:00:17,409
Speaker 0: You're this guy with a head and sort of like Kirby, you shoot while he shoots his head at things.

1137
01:00:17,469 --> 01:00:17,670
Speaker 0: Right.

1138
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:20,141
Speaker 0: And he can use this head to shoot it at bad guys.

1139
01:00:20,522 --> 01:00:26,750
Speaker 0: He can shoot it at things to grab onto them by biting and then sort of jump up sort of like a grappling hook, almost mechanic.

1140
01:00:27,152 --> 01:00:29,461
Speaker 0: He can jump, but he can't jump on bad guys to kill them.

1141
01:00:29,983 --> 01:00:36,452
Speaker 0: But he can also shoot to change his head into different things like Kirby's, like a hammer, which just can smash certain things.

1142
01:00:36,753 --> 01:00:38,119
Speaker 0: or you get the micro head.

1143
01:00:38,139 --> 01:00:39,706
Speaker 0: You know, all these heads give different powers.

1144
01:00:40,629 --> 01:00:46,015
Speaker 0: And so you're navigating these levels, trying to, you know, get into different places, different paths through the levels.

1145
01:00:46,577 --> 01:00:55,132
Speaker 0: And the thing is, each level, even though it's a platforming game, the levels are so crazy different that like each one is almost a different game into itself.

1146
01:00:55,172 --> 01:00:58,364
Speaker 0: There's even like shmup levels where he's got the airplane head.

1147
01:00:58,786 --> 01:01:03,263
Speaker 0: There's, you know, sort of like his levels like the floor tilts back and forth.

1148
01:01:03,304 --> 01:01:12,236
Speaker 0: So it ends up being almost like a platforming beat him up in a ways, you know, because you can only move in a small area while going sideways.

1149
01:01:12,618 --> 01:01:15,248
Speaker 1: The game just had a really nice sense of, yeah, weird.

1150
01:01:15,268 --> 01:01:19,486
Speaker 1: Like it was so varied and weird and every level was just so different.

1151
01:01:19,506 --> 01:01:21,877
Speaker 0: And the styling and the music is just so incredible.

1152
01:01:21,917 --> 01:01:29,914
Speaker 0: And the whole, you know, the story like this is huge, crazy cinematic opening where you fight a robot who's ransacking the town and there's mini game levels.

1153
01:01:30,536 --> 01:01:33,547
Speaker 0: And it's, you know, each, every boss is crazy unique.

1154
01:01:33,627 --> 01:01:42,380
Speaker 0: Usually the bosses come down to hit the weak spot, but like for example, one level boss, you're fighting trouble brewing and he's basically has his head.

1155
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:49,053
Speaker 0: Oh, the first time you fight him, which is pretty much the beginning of the game, he's just there standing with his full body and you kill him and his head flies off.

1156
01:01:49,395 --> 01:01:52,610
Speaker 0: And every other time you see him, his head is attached to something else.

1157
01:01:53,271 --> 01:02:03,970
Speaker 0: So you see him later and his head is attached to this ball, which is a crazy robot arm, which has a hand at the end, the hand grabs you and basically he drags you behind stage.

1158
01:02:04,170 --> 01:02:05,477
Speaker 0: And this is the crazy thing about this game.

1159
01:02:05,557 --> 01:02:09,819
Speaker 0: is it's sort of like, you know, portal has it sort of, you go behind the wall thing.

1160
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,747
Speaker 0: This game has that same thing.

1161
01:02:11,788 --> 01:02:21,945
Speaker 0: where it's like the whole game is like on a puppet show stage and you're a puppet and everyone's a puppet and things go, you can see like behind the stage all the time.

1162
01:02:21,965 --> 01:02:31,165
Speaker 0: And like if you die, I think the deaths, the game over screen is like you like getting kicked out of the theater, like through the back, like the stage exit door or something.

1163
01:02:31,206 --> 01:02:32,070
Speaker 1: I never beat the game.

1164
01:02:32,551 --> 01:02:35,144
Speaker 0: I've never beaten it, but I've gotten very, very far into it.

1165
01:02:35,164 --> 01:02:36,592
Speaker 0: I can still get very far into it.

1166
01:02:36,612 --> 01:02:40,972
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, I've used a cheat code to get to the ending boss, which is really hard.

1167
01:02:41,032 --> 01:02:41,714
Speaker 0: I can't even beat it.

1168
01:02:42,638 --> 01:02:44,244
Speaker 0: Um, but yeah, dynamite heady.

1169
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:48,098
Speaker 0: No one talks about this game, but it is, I think incredible.

1170
01:02:48,138 --> 01:02:53,678
Speaker 0: Like it's as good as say Kirby's adventure, uh, in my book, especially aesthetically, right?

1171
01:02:53,718 --> 01:03:04,306
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, the platforming parts are still really good even though they're not the best, but the aesthetic aspects of this game are like way above even something like super Mario world, right?

1172
01:03:04,406 --> 01:03:05,370
Speaker 0: It's, it's pretty incredible.

1173
01:03:06,211 --> 01:03:06,934
Speaker 0: So there you go.

1174
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:11,191
Speaker 0: There are games that I like that no one talks about or cares about or whatever.

1175
01:03:11,492 --> 01:03:11,813
Speaker 1: All right.

1176
01:03:18,004 --> 01:03:20,589
