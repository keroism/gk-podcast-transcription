1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,000
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, December 7th, and this is Geek Nights.

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,920
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex, the second gig.

3
00:00:18,744 --> 00:00:19,438
Speaker 0: And a few comments.

4
00:00:21,641 --> 00:00:22,526
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,700
Speaker 1: Man, today was boring as hell.

6
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:32,393
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, days sort of range in boringness, but... Today had to be one of the most boring days ever.

7
00:00:34,161 --> 00:00:34,605
Speaker 1: Yeah.

8
00:00:34,746 --> 00:00:36,339
Speaker 1: There wasn't so much going on in the news.

9
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:38,659
Speaker 0: Wasn't so much going on at work.

10
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:46,159
Speaker 0: And if today wasn't, you know, go to the comic book store day, it would have been one of the shittiest days there is.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would have really liked you to stay in bed today.

12
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,759
Speaker 0: Mmm, I stayed in bed Monday, though.

13
00:00:52,081 --> 00:00:57,159
Speaker 0: It wasn't any help that, you know, I accidentally set my alarm an hour later than it's supposed to be.

14
00:00:58,221 --> 00:00:59,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was great.

15
00:01:01,841 --> 00:01:09,640
Speaker 0: So, um, there's this piece of software that no longer exists, as of very recently, called ParaLyrics.

16
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:17,700
Speaker 0: And what it did is it would go check out your ID3, V2 tags, and the internet, and all sorts of things.

17
00:01:18,762 --> 00:01:25,139
Speaker 0: And it would, you know, display and show the correct lyrics for songs that you were listening to when you were listening to them.

18
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:29,880
Speaker 0: And, um, they got a cease and desist letter.

19
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:30,999
Speaker 1: From who?

20
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,002
Speaker 0: From Warner Music.

21
00:01:35,227 --> 00:01:36,410
Speaker 0: For copyright infringement.

22
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,850
Speaker 1: But, uh, the program doesn't do any copyright infringement on its own, does it?

23
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,092
Speaker 0: No shit.

24
00:01:42,894 --> 00:01:44,337
Speaker 0: It doesn't do anything illegal.

25
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:49,890
Speaker 0: All it does is show you the freaking lyrics and use the internet in any means necessary to find the lyrics.

26
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, though it is illegal to reproduce the lyrics.

27
00:01:53,753 --> 00:01:54,889
Speaker 0: He wasn't reproducing them.

28
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,235
Speaker 1: Well, I guess it's the same way.

29
00:01:56,255 --> 00:01:56,918
Speaker 1: they got Napster.

30
00:01:56,958 --> 00:01:59,310
Speaker 1: They were facilitating the illegal activity.

31
00:02:00,671 --> 00:02:01,313
Speaker 0: Mmm, I don't know.

32
00:02:01,473 --> 00:02:08,310
Speaker 0: It's weak, but the point of it is, is even though the guys probably weren't doing anything illegal, they're gone because they can't afford to fight it.

33
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:15,570
Speaker 0: It's like, if you can't afford to fight something in court, people can cease and desist you for pretty much walking and breathing.

34
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,030
Speaker 0: And if you can't fight it in court, then you'll have to stop.

35
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:18,657
Speaker 1: Yup.

36
00:02:19,711 --> 00:02:20,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, it kinda sucks.

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,055
Speaker 1: But there's really not an easy way to fix it.

38
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:24,842
Speaker 1: Lawyers are expensive.

39
00:02:24,862 --> 00:02:27,150
Speaker 1: Good lawyers are more expensive.

40
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:35,870
Speaker 0: Uh, if you want to do the suing, then you have to pay everyone's legal fees because you're so confident you'll win.

41
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:43,930
Speaker 1: No, that's really bad because then people who want to, say, file suit against a large company, if they lose, they're completely hosed.

42
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,377
Speaker 0: Uh, don't sue.

43
00:02:47,437 --> 00:02:49,330
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter who you're suing or who's suing who.

44
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,474
Speaker 1: Alright, how are they going to pay the law?

45
00:02:50,634 --> 00:02:55,050
Speaker 1: You realize that no good lawyer, unless they're working pro bono, is just going to work up front without being paid.

46
00:02:55,411 --> 00:02:56,332
Speaker 0: How about this, how about this?

47
00:02:57,093 --> 00:03:06,730
Speaker 0: If anyone sues anyone, right, no one has to pay anyone until we figure out who wins.

48
00:03:08,831 --> 00:03:15,509
Speaker 0: So if you sue someone, right, and you lose, you have to pay.

49
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:22,946
Speaker 1: That's just, see it depends because sometimes you might bring what seems to be a valid suit and then you lose on a technicality.

50
00:03:23,247 --> 00:03:24,230
Speaker 1: Things like that happen often.

51
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,470
Speaker 0: Well that sucks.

52
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:34,090
Speaker 1: So what if you sue a large corporation for what is a valid complaint, but due to one technicality they get out of it and now you're stuck paying millions and millions in legal fees?

53
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, we shouldn't have those technicalities.

54
00:03:36,118 --> 00:03:38,370
Speaker 0: If your suit is a real deal suit, you should win.

55
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:39,809
Speaker 1: Well what do you mean real deal?

56
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:41,863
Speaker 0: As in...

57
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:45,870
Speaker 1: See, that's the jurisdiction of the judge and jury to decide.

58
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:50,310
Speaker 0: Damn legal system being all complicated, we should simplify it to where freaking the judge just judges.

59
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:52,450
Speaker 1: I don't trust judges for crap.

60
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,310
Speaker 0: I don't trust judges for crap either, but at least we can have maybe a council of judges, and you know, they could even out the crap.

61
00:03:58,591 --> 00:03:59,650
Speaker 1: That's basically just a jury.

62
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:00,712
Speaker 0: That's fine.

63
00:04:02,478 --> 00:04:06,230
Speaker 0: Apparently our legal system is based on the idea of a jury being okay.

64
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:08,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, except juries really aren't that okay.

65
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,240
Speaker 0: That's only because people aren't okay.

66
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,470
Speaker 0: Juries used to be just fine.

67
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:18,570
Speaker 1: Well and it's hard for smart people to be on a jury because people who are smart tend to make more money and there's no incentive for them to be on the jury.

68
00:04:19,091 --> 00:04:23,424
Speaker 1: And even if they wanted to be on the jury, the lawyers picking jurors don't want them there.

69
00:04:23,765 --> 00:04:25,150
Speaker 1: Neither side wants smart people there.

70
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all a sham nowadays.

71
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:32,330
Speaker 1: So I guess the moral is don't ever be on either side of a legal battle.

72
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,529
Speaker 0: Don't go to court.

73
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, just stay away.

74
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:35,690
Speaker 0: Just don't go there.

75
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,610
Speaker 1: If you get sued, just leave the country and keep promoting your piracy software or whatever it was that got you in trouble.

76
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:47,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, eventually there'll be this geek country where everything's okay and everyone will do everything there and the rest of the countries in the world will suffer.

77
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:52,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, that worked so well for the robots in the Animatrix.

78
00:04:52,411 --> 00:04:53,784
Speaker 0: It did work well for those robots.

79
00:04:53,986 --> 00:04:54,289
Speaker 0: They won.

80
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,029
Speaker 1: Eh, they kinda won.

81
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:58,349
Speaker 0: Uh, completely won?

82
00:04:59,031 --> 00:05:00,729
Speaker 1: Except that they're just in a simulation too.

83
00:05:02,613 --> 00:05:03,730
Speaker 0: Still, you know, robots.

84
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,156
Speaker 1: Nah, there's really nothing.

85
00:05:05,177 --> 00:05:07,050
Speaker 1: There's just Colonel Sanders and that fat black lady.

86
00:05:08,215 --> 00:05:08,930
Speaker 0: Ah, Colonel Sanders.

87
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:14,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what, whether you've seen The Matrix three movies or not, the end is stupid.

88
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, just watch the first one which is awesome.

89
00:05:16,612 --> 00:05:18,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, and just pretend the other two don't exist.

90
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:23,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Microsoft is also on the legal side of things.

91
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:25,098
Speaker 0: Always.

92
00:05:25,118 --> 00:05:25,748
Speaker 0: At all times.

93
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:29,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, this time on the losing end, they lost another antitrust suit.

94
00:05:29,851 --> 00:05:32,527
Speaker 0: Oh, that's hard to lose an antitrust suit when your name is Mr.

95
00:05:32,568 --> 00:05:32,950
Speaker 0: Monopoly.

96
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, except this one was in South Korea.

97
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:44,710
Speaker 1: And they've been ordered, and while they may have had a valid suit that they lost, the verdict and the sentence are kinda silly.

98
00:05:46,231 --> 00:05:51,430
Speaker 1: Microsoft has 180 days to offer three different versions of Microsoft Windows in South Korea.

99
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:57,470
Speaker 1: They have to offer a version that doesn't include messaging or multimedia components.

100
00:05:58,731 --> 00:06:04,710
Speaker 1: They have to offer a version that does include them, but also includes links that are easily accessible to competitors' products.

101
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,890
Speaker 1: And then they have to offer their normal version of Windows.

102
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:11,429
Speaker 0: Well, they won't have any trouble offering the normal version of Windows.

103
00:06:11,711 --> 00:06:14,239
Speaker 0: And they don't have to remove IE.

104
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:17,750
Speaker 0: Removing Windows Messenger and such isn't really that hard.

105
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,642
Speaker 0: And changing a few desktop icons isn't really that hard.

106
00:06:21,265 --> 00:06:22,290
Speaker 0: I think they could do that in a week.

107
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I just think those requirements are kinda silly.

108
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:26,750
Speaker 0: They are kinda silly.

109
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:28,083
Speaker 1: Oh, they were also fined $32 million.

110
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:30,473
Speaker 0: You know what?

111
00:06:30,673 --> 00:06:38,710
Speaker 0: They should say you have to provide a copy, a version of Microsoft Office that's actually secure and has good performance and is stable.

112
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,789
Speaker 0: That should be what they freakin' sue 'em.

113
00:06:41,253 --> 00:06:43,409
Speaker 1: In 180 days, it would take 'em 10 years to do that.

114
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,383
Speaker 0: Hello, they've had, uh, how long has Windows been available?

115
00:06:47,644 --> 00:06:49,696
Speaker 0: Since... Windows 95 is 10 years old.

116
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:53,579
Speaker 1: Oh my god, that was 10 years ago.

117
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:54,926
Speaker 1: I remember when Windows 95 came out.

118
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, they've had 10 years since Windows 95.

119
00:06:57,990 --> 00:06:59,778
Speaker 1: In fact, I remember being real dubious of it.

120
00:06:59,839 --> 00:07:02,310
Speaker 1: I remember seeing that taskbar and that start menu.

121
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,330
Speaker 0: And it's still crap.

122
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:03,994
Speaker 1: Wow.

123
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:05,492
Speaker 0: Yeah.

124
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:08,644
Speaker 0: So, and it's been even longer since Windows 3.1.

125
00:07:08,644 --> 00:07:10,110
Speaker 0: And it's still crap.

126
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:13,458
Speaker 0: Well, at least the level of crap is... Remember the GPF?

127
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:14,030
Speaker 0: General Protection Fault?

128
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:15,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember that.

129
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,569
Speaker 0: Alright, so.

130
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,629
Speaker 1: I remember getting blue screens and white screens.

131
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:19,930
Speaker 0: I never had a white screen.

132
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,690
Speaker 1: White screens were like kernel troubles.

133
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:22,333
Speaker 1: Hmm.

134
00:07:24,691 --> 00:07:26,869
Speaker 1: Well, I guess the moral of that story is use Linux.

135
00:07:28,153 --> 00:07:28,383
Speaker 0: Linux.

136
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:30,287
Speaker 0: Ubuntu.

137
00:07:32,412 --> 00:07:33,881
Speaker 1: Yeah, there really wasn't so much news.

138
00:07:34,606 --> 00:07:34,928
Speaker 1: So, uh...

139
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's part of why my day was so boring, I mean.

140
00:07:37,432 --> 00:07:38,608
Speaker 0: Not so much work to do.

141
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,730
Speaker 1: We don't have music 'cause you didn't like our music.

142
00:07:43,810 --> 00:07:46,223
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll come up with something new soon.

143
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,530
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll not.

144
00:07:48,432 --> 00:07:48,673
Speaker 1: Yeah.

145
00:07:48,693 --> 00:07:49,841
Speaker 1: Alright, alright.

146
00:07:50,123 --> 00:07:51,030
Speaker 1: So my thing of the day.

147
00:07:51,591 --> 00:07:56,810
Speaker 1: This is kind of cool because it actually plays into the jury stuff we were talking about just a few seconds ago.

148
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,101
Speaker 0: What's your thing of the day?

149
00:07:58,122 --> 00:07:58,589
Speaker 0: I didn't see it.

150
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:02,403
Speaker 1: Alright, well basically, today a 101 year old woman finally died.

151
00:08:04,351 --> 00:08:09,330
Speaker 1: Her name was Maggie Bailey, and she was probably the most famous bootlegger in the history of America.

152
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,349
Speaker 0: Bootlegger?

153
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, bootlegger.

154
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:18,870
Speaker 1: Like... From the age of 17 until she was 95, she was queen of the mountain bootleggers.

155
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:20,093
Speaker 0: Wait, wait.

156
00:08:20,314 --> 00:08:23,270
Speaker 0: From the ages of 17 to 95?

157
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:28,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, she made alcohol in stills in a fairly professional way and sold it.

158
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:31,569
Speaker 1: And when prohibition came around, she kept selling it.

159
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:36,950
Speaker 1: And then when prohibition ended, she kept selling it, and she was kind of a local folk hero down there in Kentucky.

160
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:38,870
Speaker 0: What kind of alcohol did she make?

161
00:08:39,052 --> 00:08:39,467
Speaker 1: All kinds.

162
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:40,768
Speaker 0: Good kinds?

163
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,515
Speaker 1: Yeah, she was a friggin' distiller.

164
00:08:42,537 --> 00:08:45,450
Speaker 1: She made all sorts of various asunder illegal alcohol.

165
00:08:46,190 --> 00:08:46,234
Speaker 1: Oh.

166
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,709
Speaker 1: And apparently, she was real shrewd.

167
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:52,770
Speaker 1: Apparently there's a US district judge that personally knew her and was her lawyer.

168
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:57,525
Speaker 1: And he said, quote, "She knew the law as a search and seizure as well as any person I've

169
00:08:57,565 --> 00:08:57,806
Speaker 1: known.".

170
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:00,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, when you met...

171
00:09:03,012 --> 00:09:07,150
Speaker 1: And she was never convicted and sent to jail due to the doctrine of jury nullification.

172
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,529
Speaker 0: She got jury nullified every time?

173
00:09:09,794 --> 00:09:10,006
Speaker 1: Yes.

174
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:12,749
Speaker 0: It must have always been a jury of the peers in the town.

175
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:22,090
Speaker 1: Well, basically what happened, and I consider this to all of you out there as a public service announcement, jury nullification is a right that you have no matter what any judge tells you.

176
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:23,204
Speaker 0: Jury nullification rules.

177
00:09:23,811 --> 00:09:32,810
Speaker 1: The thing is, judges are, not only are judges going to tell you that you can't do it, it is illegal for lawyers in a trial to tell you about it, or to ask you about it.

178
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:37,390
Speaker 0: But it does exist, and juries can do it whenever they want, regardless of what anyone says.

179
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:41,970
Speaker 1: So basically, what happened, and the precedent for this goes all the way back to before the Revolutionary War.

180
00:09:42,350 --> 00:09:42,690
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

181
00:09:43,035 --> 00:09:43,750
Speaker 1: So, don't worry about it.

182
00:09:43,811 --> 00:09:44,288
Speaker 1: It's mad old.

183
00:09:44,672 --> 00:09:46,030
Speaker 1: You can Wikipedia all this stuff.

184
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:48,970
Speaker 0: I think it might even go back to Britain in juries by trial by jury.

185
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:52,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm talking about the history in America goes back to just before the Revolutionary War.

186
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:52,354
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

187
00:09:53,010 --> 00:10:01,188
Speaker 1: But basically, jury nullification is a concept that the people hold the absolute power in the judicial system, the people on the jury.

188
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:04,910
Speaker 1: So, people on the jury decide if you're innocent or guilty.

189
00:10:05,630 --> 00:10:18,130
Speaker 1: However, say you're on a jury, and you and the rest of the jury agree that while someone technically is guilty, say they did commit the crime that they are charged with, but you believe it shouldn't be a crime.

190
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:22,290
Speaker 1: You can just give them a not guilty verdict, and they can't punish you.

191
00:10:22,551 --> 00:10:24,810
Speaker 1: Juries can decide whatever they want, however they want.

192
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:32,430
Speaker 0: A jury is supposed to say, you know, let's say it's a criminal trial, and if there's reasonable doubt, you're supposed to say not guilty.

193
00:10:32,831 --> 00:10:35,630
Speaker 0: And if there's no reasonable doubt, you're supposed to say guilty.

194
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:40,789
Speaker 0: And 99.9% of the time, that's what you're going to want to do.

195
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:50,848
Speaker 0: But if somebody, say, is guilty of, I don't know, downloading some MP3s, and there's no reasonable doubt, they definitely did it.

196
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,130
Speaker 0: I mean, they're standing right there, listening to them on their iPod, and they didn't pay for them, ever.

197
00:10:55,352 --> 00:10:56,770
Speaker 0: And they don't have a CD or anything.

198
00:10:58,852 --> 00:11:04,349
Speaker 0: If you don't think that that should be illegal, you think that's perfectly fine, like I do, you just say not guilty, no matter what.

199
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:04,595
Speaker 1: Yeah.

200
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:06,849
Speaker 0: Because you're a jury, and you can frickin' do that.

201
00:11:07,535 --> 00:11:08,469
Speaker 0: No matter what anyone says.

202
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:17,649
Speaker 1: Now, it's been waning lately, because a lot of juries, a lot of jury advocates and judicial advocates are fighting furiously to prevent people from finding out about it.

203
00:11:18,272 --> 00:11:20,230
Speaker 1: But it pretty much hit its peak during Prohibition.

204
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:33,190
Speaker 1: They estimate that about 60%, 60, of all illegal bootlegging cases were thrown out due to jury nullification, because most people in America drank alcohol, and most people didn't want it to be illegal.

205
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:38,050
Speaker 1: So when they sat on a jury of someone who was providing their alcohol, they just said not guilty.

206
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:46,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you gotta wonder how much of that was due to, you know, like, little Al Capone giving money to the jury actions.

207
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:50,970
Speaker 1: I think the fact that, I don't think Al Capone would need to bribe anyone.

208
00:11:51,611 --> 00:11:52,590
Speaker 0: He did in that movie.

209
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, in that movie, because that's what happened.

210
00:11:55,531 --> 00:11:57,810
Speaker 0: It's close to what happened, it's just dramaticized.

211
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:03,750
Speaker 1: See, here's the thing, in the movie The Untouchables, The Untouchables are frickin' awesome, and Elliot Ness is this awesome, awesome dude.

212
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,529
Speaker 0: He was really a prick.

213
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:07,969
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the real world, Elliot Ness was a giant cock.

214
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:09,210
Speaker 0: Sean Connery wasn't.

215
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:15,230
Speaker 1: People who knew him back in the day, people who actually knew him, talked about how much of a stickler for the rules, and just a jackass he was.

216
00:12:15,493 --> 00:12:16,430
Speaker 0: It's kind of like Ken Starr.

217
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:19,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, or actually even good old Fitzgerald.

218
00:12:20,552 --> 00:12:22,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, Fitzgerald's a little nicer.

219
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,890
Speaker 1: But most people liked alcohol, and they wanted alcohol, and they got alcohol.

220
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:29,570
Speaker 1: And if someone was arrested for giving them alcohol, they weren't going to send them to jail.

221
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:30,211
Speaker 0: Yep.

222
00:12:31,074 --> 00:12:34,690
Speaker 0: Nowadays, they would send them to jail, even if they didn't want to, because they don't know.

223
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:37,249
Speaker 1: Now, there's two ways to play this.

224
00:12:37,931 --> 00:12:54,970
Speaker 1: Say you don't want to be on jury duty for whatever reason, the 100% guaranteed way to get out of jury duty is to simply state at the beginning of jury selection that you feel obligated to inform the lawyers that you believe in the doctrine of jury nullification.

225
00:12:56,432 --> 00:12:59,570
Speaker 1: And I can guarantee that they'll kick you out of that trial faster than you can blink.

226
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:10,730
Speaker 0: The other way is, if you want to be on a jury, like me, you can go in and then tell everyone all about jury nullification, if you think that it should be nullified.

227
00:13:10,910 --> 00:13:13,190
Speaker 0: I'm not saying you should just go nullifying all around the place.

228
00:13:13,490 --> 00:13:17,430
Speaker 0: If you're on the trial of some guy who killed his mom, and you know he killed his mom...

229
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:19,129
Speaker 1: Like they have a movie of him killing his mom?

230
00:13:19,470 --> 00:13:23,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't freakin' use the jury nullification just to be all jury nullification-ing.

231
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,530
Speaker 0: You know, when you got a hammer, everything looks like nails.

232
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:28,858
Speaker 0: Well, no.

233
00:13:29,584 --> 00:13:30,189
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

234
00:13:31,092 --> 00:13:34,569
Speaker 0: If there's no reasonable doubt and someone's bad, lock them up.

235
00:13:36,894 --> 00:13:43,288
Speaker 0: But, you know, if it's something that you don't think should be wrong, or you think that, you know, maybe there's another reason.

236
00:13:43,308 --> 00:13:43,650
Speaker 0: you have.

237
00:13:43,810 --> 00:13:46,609
Speaker 0: Like, you're against the death penalty and they're gonna give it to him.

238
00:13:47,030 --> 00:13:47,123
Speaker 0: Yeah.

239
00:13:47,491 --> 00:13:54,350
Speaker 0: Or if you think that he's guilty and the crime should be punished, but the current, like, sentencing laws are way too hard.

240
00:13:54,490 --> 00:13:55,129
Speaker 1: See, here's another problem.

241
00:13:55,190 --> 00:13:57,306
Speaker 0: Like, he's a hacker, but he's gonna go to jail for 20 years.

242
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:02,770
Speaker 1: Outside of death penalty cases, because a judge has to tell you if someone's up for the death penalty.

243
00:14:02,970 --> 00:14:03,038
Speaker 0: Yep.

244
00:14:03,653 --> 00:14:06,670
Speaker 1: They don't have to tell you what the actual possible sentences are.

245
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:07,301
Speaker 0: You can look it up.

246
00:14:08,153 --> 00:14:09,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're not supposed to.

247
00:14:10,191 --> 00:14:11,949
Speaker 1: And even then, the judge won't tell you.

248
00:14:12,230 --> 00:14:17,290
Speaker 1: The judge won't tell you if there's a minimum sentence for something, because they don't want you to think that maybe that's unfair and let the guy go.

249
00:14:18,971 --> 00:14:25,270
Speaker 0: But you know that, like, most hacking laws and such are, like, way too severe with the punishments.

250
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:32,690
Speaker 0: Like, a guy who hacks into a computer somewhere shouldn't get no 50 years unless he, like, hacked into a bank and stole a pile of money.

251
00:14:32,836 --> 00:14:32,963
Speaker 0: Yeah.

252
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:36,990
Speaker 0: He should get maybe a couple years, or maybe even months, depending on how big it was.

253
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:40,090
Speaker 0: But the minimum sentences are, like, insane.

254
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:46,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, consider that minimum sentencing sets it up in many places where second-degree murder, you'll spend less time in jail.

255
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:52,570
Speaker 1: if you were, you know, good behavior, than, uh, say, having an ounce of marijuana.

256
00:14:52,970 --> 00:15:01,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you see someone who, like, you know, does some hacking or some weed smoking or something-- Yeah, a punk kid who had, like, one joint in his pocket.

257
00:15:01,612 --> 00:15:06,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you don't want them to go for five years, even though you think they should maybe get some few months.

258
00:15:06,711 --> 00:15:09,270
Speaker 0: That might be a time when you want to whip out the jury nullification.

259
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:10,091
Speaker 1: Yep.

260
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:14,409
Speaker 1: So keep it in mind, spread the word, I'm a big advocate of it, and I hope you will be, too.

261
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:15,042
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

262
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:17,130
Speaker 1: And that was probably the longest thing of the day I've ever had.

263
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:17,795
Speaker 0: Probably.

264
00:15:18,037 --> 00:15:18,320
Speaker 0: All right.

265
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,250
Speaker 0: I don't know.

266
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,999
Speaker 1: Can you top that?

267
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,210
Speaker 1: 101-year-old bootlegger, jury nullification, all in one go?

268
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:29,070
Speaker 0: Well, if the speakers on my laptop weren't broken, this video might be able to top that.

269
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:30,326
Speaker 1: Okay.

270
00:15:30,631 --> 00:15:35,569
Speaker 0: This is the Japanese commercial for the Super Nintendo Zelda game.

271
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:37,575
Speaker 1: Oh my God!

272
00:15:37,595 --> 00:15:37,676
Speaker 1: OMFG!

273
00:15:39,650 --> 00:15:42,008
Speaker 0: It's Link and a bunch of people in--.

274
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:43,029
Speaker 0: Is that Michael Jackson?

275
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,756
Speaker 0: They're doing a thriller-style dance.

276
00:15:45,997 --> 00:15:50,390
Speaker 0: It's a guy dressed up as Link and a bunch of other people doing some sort of dance.

277
00:15:50,410 --> 00:15:52,529
Speaker 1: All right, I think I just saw a Zelda doing a cage dance.

278
00:15:52,770 --> 00:16:01,050
Speaker 0: Zelda's in a cage doing a dance, and a lisel-phos with a big flail is going to come after her, and she's going to scream.

279
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:03,210
Speaker 1: Wow, Zelda's hot.

280
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,357
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's a hot Japanese chick.

281
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:09,989
Speaker 0: She says something in lip-sync, but it's-- And Link is a boshounen.

282
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,357
Speaker 0: There's a whizrobe.

283
00:16:11,941 --> 00:16:13,110
Speaker 0: There's a spinning sword.

284
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,649
Speaker 1: All right, that was the lamest thing I've ever seen.

285
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,039
Speaker 0: Oh, Zelda escaped.

286
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:22,200
Speaker 0: Here's a giant guy in a Ganon costume.

287
00:16:22,604 --> 00:16:24,339
Speaker 1: Ooh, Ganondorf.

288
00:16:24,861 --> 00:16:27,060
Speaker 1: Oh, it's the old-school Ganon with the pig face.

289
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:28,980
Speaker 0: Ooh, they're still dancing.

290
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:36,940
Speaker 1: All right, uh, I don't know how you found that, but, uh, lolcano.

291
00:16:37,802 --> 00:16:39,200
Speaker 0: That was an absolute roflcopter.

292
00:16:43,021 --> 00:16:48,040
Speaker 0: Now, I mean, you've seen the one where it's like, you know, "Legend of Zelda" and it's really red.

293
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:50,340
Speaker 0: It just blows that one away.

294
00:16:51,264 --> 00:16:52,458
Speaker 1: Yeah, you want to watch this.

295
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:57,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you like to laugh at funny videos on the internet, this is the thing of the day for you.

296
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,339
Speaker 1: So, the main bit.

297
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:03,738
Speaker 0: Bit.

298
00:17:04,363 --> 00:17:04,757
Speaker 1: Bit.

299
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:05,497
Speaker 0: Bite.

300
00:17:06,484 --> 00:17:06,979
Speaker 1: Main bit.

301
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:07,777
Speaker 0: Megabyte.

302
00:17:10,903 --> 00:17:16,200
Speaker 1: All right, so we've seen the first four episodes of Ghost in the Shell Standalone Complex 2nd Gig.

303
00:17:16,724 --> 00:17:17,659
Speaker 0: Oh, the 2nd gig.

304
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,465
Speaker 1: You know what?

305
00:17:18,992 --> 00:17:19,680
Speaker 1: It's badass.

306
00:17:20,501 --> 00:17:21,343
Speaker 0: It's badass.

307
00:17:21,424 --> 00:17:26,740
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's as good as the first gig, but there's a lot of fanservice, you know, and while the fanservice...

308
00:17:26,861 --> 00:17:29,000
Speaker 1: Not fanservice like TNA, fanservice like...

309
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:29,540
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

310
00:17:29,540 --> 00:17:35,260
Speaker 1: This isn't really a spoiler because this is spoiled in the opener to the show, but there's frickin' Tachikomas.

311
00:17:35,665 --> 00:17:35,939
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

312
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,878
Speaker 1: All over the place.

313
00:17:37,664 --> 00:17:38,739
Speaker 0: All over the place.

314
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,660
Speaker 1: Tachikomatic days are back and longer.

315
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:43,009
Speaker 0: In full force.

316
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:43,920
Speaker 0: And most excellent.

317
00:17:44,221 --> 00:17:45,379
Speaker 1: And there's still a tiny Jameson.

318
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:46,698
Speaker 0: Oh, Jameson.

319
00:17:47,582 --> 00:17:49,492
Speaker 1: And actually, I mean, the music's the same.

320
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:50,336
Speaker 1: Same type of music.

321
00:17:50,376 --> 00:17:51,020
Speaker 1: Yoko Kanno.

322
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:58,440
Speaker 1: And it looks like, unlike the previous standalone complex, this one has a much more contiguous overarching plot.

323
00:17:58,840 --> 00:17:58,930
Speaker 0: Yeah.

324
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,027
Speaker 1: Even the opener lends itself to that.

325
00:18:01,067 --> 00:18:03,680
Speaker 1: The opener shows, like, it's gonna be this really epic kind of thing.

326
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:04,581
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

327
00:18:04,601 --> 00:18:10,760
Speaker 0: I mean, the first gig was, you know, kind of like Howie Bebop, where maybe five or six of the episodes are plot and the rest are just whatever.

328
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:16,740
Speaker 0: And this one is definitely, every episode is part of this big plot and has a role in it.

329
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:19,049
Speaker 0: And it's big time action.

330
00:18:19,069 --> 00:18:21,420
Speaker 0: It's everything fans want to see.

331
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:21,824
Speaker 0: Yep.

332
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:30,060
Speaker 0: That's kind of the reason why it's not as good is because it's just, you know, it's not really deep and awesome art-wise.

333
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:37,460
Speaker 1: Well, I point out the second episode, which was not at all what you'd expect from this show and had zero fan service.

334
00:18:37,761 --> 00:18:38,122
Speaker 0: Yeah.

335
00:18:38,422 --> 00:18:42,111
Speaker 0: I mean, it's good, but I don't think it's as good as the first one.

336
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:46,000
Speaker 0: And it's not that I don't like the fan service-y parts.

337
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,920
Speaker 0: I mean, I love all that action.

338
00:18:47,981 --> 00:18:48,671
Speaker 0: Batou going,

339
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:48,895
Speaker 0: "Hey!"

340
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:51,735
Speaker 0: It makes you feel real good, and you're like, "Oh, yeah!

341
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:51,916
Speaker 1: All

342
00:18:51,956 --> 00:18:52,459
Speaker 1: right!".

343
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,353
Speaker 0: But in the end, you don't feel that the show was as great a show.

344
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:58,220
Speaker 0: You just really like to watch it.

345
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:03,538
Speaker 0: Kind of like Initial D. Like, you can't say Initial D's a great show, but I could watch Initial D, like, 10,000 freakin' times.

346
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,680
Speaker 1: We still haven't bought that last DVD.

347
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,980
Speaker 0: Well, it's Extra Stage.

348
00:19:08,521 --> 00:19:10,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, we haven't seen Fourth Stage yet either.

349
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,100
Speaker 0: I'll probably get it on Amazon or something.

350
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,159
Speaker 1: Or the live-action movie, even though all our friends have seen it.

351
00:19:15,621 --> 00:19:17,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't even seen the anime movie yet.

352
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,414
Speaker 1: I've seen the anime movie.

353
00:19:20,454 --> 00:19:20,999
Speaker 1: It's really good.

354
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:22,523
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I'll find it.

355
00:19:22,623 --> 00:19:26,980
Speaker 0: Anyway, second gig, worth seeing if you like the first one.

356
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:27,470
Speaker 1: Yep.

357
00:19:27,783 --> 00:19:28,099
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

358
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:33,140
Speaker 1: However, only two DVDs are out, and the only real way to see it is to watch it on Adult Swim right now.

359
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I don't like dubs, but wait.

360
00:19:35,614 --> 00:19:36,660
Speaker 0: Well, I don't like that dub.

361
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wish I could like more dubs, but most of them really are kind of his poor.

362
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:51,240
Speaker 0: I think, I mean, like, I even heard the ADV guy say, or at least read him saying, that they just get, you know, the crap voice actors because they're cheap on purpose so that they can put things out faster.

363
00:19:51,721 --> 00:19:52,739
Speaker 1: Why are they just not even bothering?

364
00:19:54,301 --> 00:19:54,683
Speaker 0: I don't know.

365
00:19:54,703 --> 00:19:58,940
Speaker 0: I guess there are a lot of people who watch the dubs, and they need to get them on TV.

366
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:01,707
Speaker 0: They're doing a much better job of getting them on TV.

367
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:05,618
Speaker 0: If you look at the Adult Swim lineup now, it's like, oh, they got their shit down.

368
00:20:05,638 --> 00:20:06,140
Speaker 0: Alright.

369
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,402
Speaker 1: Well, I gotta admit, it's weird.

370
00:20:07,422 --> 00:20:09,787
Speaker 1: Like, I can see a lot of new fans preferring dubs.

371
00:20:10,328 --> 00:20:16,420
Speaker 1: I mean, when I first saw anime, I saw dubs because that was what was on TV, on the sci-fi channel.

372
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:22,660
Speaker 1: And then I started getting shows that, I mean, back in the VHS days, you had to pick sub or dub, and a lot of stores didn't have both.

373
00:20:23,002 --> 00:20:23,178
Speaker 0: Yep.

374
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:35,560
Speaker 1: And I kind of had trouble watching subtitled anime because I could read it quick enough, but Japanese is a different language, and it was really hard to kind of understand the emotion or what people were implying.

375
00:20:35,941 --> 00:20:37,264
Speaker 0: See, the thing is this.

376
00:20:37,344 --> 00:20:39,209
Speaker 0: It wasn't even an issue for me, right?

377
00:20:39,289 --> 00:20:43,260
Speaker 0: It was just, I didn't even realize there was this sub-dub-ness going on.

378
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,353
Speaker 0: It's like, before I went to RIT, every anime I saw was a dub.

379
00:20:47,574 --> 00:20:49,260
Speaker 0: That's how it was, you know?

380
00:20:49,642 --> 00:20:51,612
Speaker 0: And I didn't notice if they were good or bad.

381
00:20:51,653 --> 00:20:53,000
Speaker 0: It was just a show I was watching.

382
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:57,834
Speaker 0: But then as soon as I got to RIT, people were like, "Oh, sub-dub wars,

383
00:20:57,894 --> 00:20:58,416
Speaker 0: blah.".

384
00:20:58,456 --> 00:20:59,339
Speaker 0: And I was like, "What are you talking

385
00:20:59,359 --> 00:20:59,560
Speaker 0: about?".

386
00:20:59,786 --> 00:20:59,999
Speaker 1: Yep.

387
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:16,180
Speaker 0: And then after watching enough subtitled anime, you know, and then you realize how you just, when you listen to the voice actors in the dub, the way they act and, like, 'cause you get to the point where you're not even getting the meaning.

388
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:20,232
Speaker 0: When you watch a sub, you don't get the meaning of what they're saying from the voice.

389
00:21:20,594 --> 00:21:22,680
Speaker 0: You just kind of get this feeling from their voices.

390
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:23,519
Speaker 1: But that's important.

391
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:26,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the meanings come from the words you read on the screen.

392
00:21:27,484 --> 00:21:42,600
Speaker 0: So when you watch a dub, you're getting the meaning from the voice, which comes across just fine because they say the right words, but the feeling from the voice is all wrong compared to the sub, and it feels kind of cheap a lot of the time.

393
00:21:42,988 --> 00:21:43,198
Speaker 1: Yep.

394
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,099
Speaker 0: And incorrect and bleh.

395
00:21:45,521 --> 00:21:56,760
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not always apparent right away, but the more I watch and the more I got used to hearing Japanese and hearing the way it was spoken, there's so much there that the American voice actors just really aren't emoting.

396
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,461
Speaker 0: Mm, absolutely.

397
00:21:58,522 --> 00:22:00,645
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of things that are emoting just wrong.

398
00:22:01,286 --> 00:22:05,132
Speaker 0: Or a lot of, like, the way they'll word things because of the translation.

399
00:22:05,152 --> 00:22:05,913
Speaker 0: that's painful.

400
00:22:05,973 --> 00:22:07,375
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, why did you say that?

401
00:22:07,395 --> 00:22:09,679
Speaker 0: That's just something painful to hear people

402
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:10,060
Speaker 0: say.".

403
00:22:10,792 --> 00:22:11,079
Speaker 1: Yeah.

404
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:16,095
Speaker 0: You know, but a Japanese person saying it isn't painful because I don't know Japanese.

405
00:22:16,155 --> 00:22:17,840
Speaker 0: Maybe if I was Japanese, it would be painful.

406
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:19,401
Speaker 1: Well, plus it's just different.

407
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:25,352
Speaker 1: I mean, in Japanese, you would say things that really don't translate well into English.

408
00:22:25,372 --> 00:22:27,096
Speaker 1: They're not something an American would say.

409
00:22:27,697 --> 00:22:29,500
Speaker 1: They would convey that in a completely different way.

410
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:30,722
Speaker 0: Yep.

411
00:22:30,743 --> 00:22:36,480
Speaker 0: But anyway, regardless of that, definitely stand-alone complex, second-guess, high quality.

412
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:51,240
Speaker 0: So, there were some two anime newses I saw here on the Anime News Network, which, by the way, the Anime News Network has this little annoying thing going on where they're advertising for this thing called, I think, The Fuckins?

413
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,358
Speaker 1: The what?

414
00:22:52,961 --> 00:22:54,863
Speaker 0: F-U-C-C-O-N-S.

415
00:22:55,364 --> 00:23:06,480
Speaker 0: It looks like it's some CG kind of show, but anyway, I don't want to promote it because, freakin', they re-themed their whole site into a giant advertisement for this thing, and it's really freakin' annoying.

416
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:07,423
Speaker 1: Ah.

417
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:11,770
Speaker 0: So, whatever that thing is, I don't know what it is.

418
00:23:11,810 --> 00:23:13,796
Speaker 0: If you know what it is, tell us, 'cause I'd like to know.

419
00:23:13,836 --> 00:23:15,120
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna click on any of these ads.

420
00:23:15,501 --> 00:23:18,860
Speaker 1: See, my ad blocker is so extreme that I didn't even know anything had happened.

421
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:19,441
Speaker 0: Yeah.

422
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:29,500
Speaker 0: But anyway, do I encourage you not to buy this thing or watch it or anything because of their pain-in-the-ass advertising?

423
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:34,339
Speaker 0: I've just basically, now, I've blocked every single image from AnimeNewsNetwork.com.

424
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,520
Speaker 1: Well, I'm at the page now, and I just see texts and nothing else.

425
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, you probably, we've got all the images blocked.

426
00:23:40,263 --> 00:23:48,840
Speaker 0: But anyway, the first bit of news is that Bandai made a little announcement, and the announcement isn't a particularly exciting announcement.

427
00:23:49,021 --> 00:23:52,960
Speaker 0: I think they're doing something with, like, Wings of Hominase or something like that.

428
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,440
Speaker 1: Which is an excellent, excellent movie.

429
00:23:54,921 --> 00:23:55,707
Speaker 0: It is, it is.

430
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:56,573
Speaker 0: Did I see it?

431
00:23:56,634 --> 00:23:57,400
Speaker 0: I don't remember if I saw it.

432
00:23:58,642 --> 00:24:01,999
Speaker 1: I watched, like, a fifth-generation fansub that craps out at the end.

433
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:02,661
Speaker 0: Yeah.

434
00:24:03,143 --> 00:24:06,860
Speaker 0: I don't know, I can't, the news isn't really loading right now.

435
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,560
Speaker 0: Well, there is something wrong with this.

436
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:10,239
Speaker 1: The, uh, Pat LeBourne movies.

437
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:10,881
Speaker 0: Yep.

438
00:24:11,582 --> 00:24:21,560
Speaker 0: That's the major part of the news that I'm interested in, is that they're gonna put Pat LeBourne movies 1 and 2, which are excellent movies, in a limiters collect, limited collector's edition box.

439
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,040
Speaker 0: So I'm probably gonna be buying that box.

440
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,960
Speaker 1: Yep, and they're gonna be remastered and pretty, 'cause these are kinda old movies.

441
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:30,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're excellent, excellent A anime movies that are awesome.

442
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:30,320
Speaker 1: Yes.

443
00:24:30,341 --> 00:24:33,038
Speaker 1: I mean, if you like Ghost in the Shell and all that, you'll love Pat LeBourne.

444
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:34,788
Speaker 0: Oh, absolutely.

445
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:36,860
Speaker 0: Oh, okay, here's what's happening.

446
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:47,640
Speaker 0: Is that they're, um, they're making a new label for anime called the Honeme, Honeme, how, wow, they're spelling it all weird.

447
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:50,779
Speaker 0: They're spelling it H-O-N-N-E-A-M-I-S-E.

448
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:52,300
Speaker 1: That's how it's spelled.

449
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,919
Speaker 0: I thought it was Honemeise, not Honemeise.

450
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,119
Speaker 1: Whatever.

451
00:24:57,201 --> 00:24:57,662
Speaker 0: Whatever.

452
00:24:58,064 --> 00:25:02,140
Speaker 0: Is that they're making that a new label, and then publishing anime under that label.

453
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:02,879
Speaker 1: Huh.

454
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:07,816
Speaker 0: So I'm beginning to think that any anime that's published under that label is an anime.

455
00:25:07,856 --> 00:25:09,040
Speaker 0: that's the kind that we like.

456
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:10,979
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see how it pans out.

457
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:11,840
Speaker 0: Yep, definitely.

458
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:17,240
Speaker 0: Alright, the second bit of news is in the fansubbing world, and not in the pro world.

459
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,704
Speaker 1: Ah, fansubs.

460
00:25:18,965 --> 00:25:22,340
Speaker 1: The gray area of intellectual property that warms the cockles of my heart.

461
00:25:23,061 --> 00:25:29,273
Speaker 0: Yep, so Funimation sent a little message over to ShinsenSubs, who are subbers that I know.

462
00:25:29,353 --> 00:25:32,900
Speaker 0: because it just so happens a lot of the stuff I like happens to be done by them.

463
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:58,557
Speaker 0: And, you know, I just download my stuff from, like, torrent collecti sites, but their label is often on the ones I get, so they got a message from Funimation that says, "We owner control various exclusive copyrights and trademarks, blabbity blabbity blabbity blah, the series known as Speed Graph or Trinity Blood, Full Metal Alchemist, Dragon Ball Salty Ray, aka Origin, Detective Conan, aka Case Closed, and Tsubasa.

464
00:25:59,578 --> 00:26:01,260
Speaker 0: Blah blah blah, stop doing

465
00:26:01,300 --> 00:26:01,440
Speaker 0: that.".

466
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:14,500
Speaker 0: And this is kind of weird, because A, no one's ever told a fansub group to stop doing something that was not yet licensed ever before.

467
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:22,214
Speaker 0: 2, they haven't previously announced licenses to Salty Ray and Tsubasa, so now I guess they are licensed by them.

468
00:26:22,776 --> 00:26:24,820
Speaker 0: So it's like a weird way to announce your license.

469
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:39,697
Speaker 0: And basically, AnimeSki took down Salty Ray and Tsubasa torrents, and the fansub group, as far as I know, didn't-- those are guys that follow the license rules.

470
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:41,420
Speaker 0: As far as I know, they might not.

471
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:49,414
Speaker 0: So I'm pretty sure they didn't still have their torrents up for these other already licensed shows like Full Metal Alchemist and such.

472
00:26:50,016 --> 00:26:52,240
Speaker 0: You know, it being on TV and on DVD already.

473
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:59,587
Speaker 0: So, you know, why did they list all those if those were no longer being distributed?

474
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:11,160
Speaker 0: And I was also under the impression that a lot of the American anime companies knew the score with fansubs and liked them, you know, as long as they went away, because that's how they were figuring out what shows to get and such.

475
00:27:12,141 --> 00:27:23,000
Speaker 1: I could see this being some guy in the company talked to the lawyer team independently of another guy and just had a notice sent and maybe didn't think it through or talked to the people he should have talked to.

476
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:31,114
Speaker 0: I have a feeling it's that Funimation used to just be the guys who did Dragon Ball, and now they're actually like busting out big time.

477
00:27:31,134 --> 00:27:32,296
Speaker 0: They got FMA and everything.

478
00:27:33,478 --> 00:27:35,669
Speaker 0: And I think, you know-- They're upsetting the balance.

479
00:27:35,709 --> 00:27:37,060
Speaker 1: They don't know how to deal with fansubbers.

480
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:43,720
Speaker 0: I don't have a feeling that they're as cool as ADV and Viz and those guys who were originally fansubber types.

481
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:49,480
Speaker 1: Well, maybe they'll learn, because the backlash of geeks that are angry is a powerful force indeed.

482
00:27:50,221 --> 00:27:54,666
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if Funimation DVD sales started to go down.

483
00:27:54,706 --> 00:28:03,175
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not gonna not buy FMA, but I wouldn't be surprised if a whole lot of people were like, "Hey, they wear asshats about it.

484
00:28:03,756 --> 00:28:07,260
Speaker 0: Now we're gonna extra fansub their shows," or something like that.

485
00:28:08,281 --> 00:28:11,312
Speaker 0: And there'll be this little split in the anime community or something.

486
00:28:11,553 --> 00:28:12,556
Speaker 0: Wouldn't surprise me at all.

487
00:28:12,577 --> 00:28:13,500
Speaker 0: I'm not saying it's gonna happen.

488
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,934
Speaker 1: Oh, a split and a geek subculture.

489
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:16,840
Speaker 1: That's never happened.

490
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:17,640
Speaker 0: No, never.

491
00:28:20,081 --> 00:28:21,665
Speaker 0: But, you know, we'll see.

492
00:28:21,965 --> 00:28:25,854
Speaker 0: If it works for Funimation, would we see other companies do it?

493
00:28:26,977 --> 00:28:28,440
Speaker 0: Maybe Bandai or someone.

494
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,825
Speaker 1: See, I don't see it working for them.

495
00:28:30,865 --> 00:28:35,920
Speaker 1: I don't see it having any effect on their business unless they do it too hardly, and then it'll be a negative effect.

496
00:28:36,361 --> 00:28:52,740
Speaker 0: I see it having an effect over the years, because if they keep it going, right, and they get rid of all the fansubs, and then next year they just block the fansubs entirely, then they really won't know which shows to license, because they won't know which ones people like.

497
00:28:53,305 --> 00:28:53,520
Speaker 0: Yeah.

498
00:28:53,800 --> 00:29:00,180
Speaker 0: I mean, that's how they knew that Naruto was a hot property, was because there was this freaking huge, crazy stuff going on.

499
00:29:00,621 --> 00:29:05,880
Speaker 1: And all that stuff will still happen, but it'll be pushed more and more underground, and they won't be able to find out about it.

500
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:06,220
Speaker 1: Yep.

501
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:15,400
Speaker 0: I mean, that's how Walden Books knew to carry Death Note in Japanese, and how Viz knew to license it right away, was because freaking everyone was reading Death Note and translating it into English and crap.

502
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:23,178
Speaker 0: You didn't see them doing that for other manga, so Viz and such were like, "Ahh, maybe that's one we should

503
00:29:23,218 --> 00:29:23,379
Speaker 0: do.".

504
00:29:24,441 --> 00:29:26,426
Speaker 1: And it helps that anime fans play the game.

505
00:29:26,667 --> 00:29:32,040
Speaker 1: They download the fansubs, but somehow DVD sales are still really, really strong, and everyone makes out.

506
00:29:32,981 --> 00:29:33,202
Speaker 0: Yep.

507
00:29:33,222 --> 00:29:37,254
Speaker 0: So anime skis complied, and I'm guessing the Shinsen guys complied.

508
00:29:37,294 --> 00:29:37,896
Speaker 0: I don't know.

509
00:29:37,916 --> 00:29:39,380
Speaker 0: It doesn't really say.

510
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:40,919
Speaker 1: Well, we'll see what happens.

511
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,540
Speaker 0: We'll definitely get some updates on this in the future.

512
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:48,800
Speaker 1: Though, that being all the anime news we got, we got a comic today.

513
00:29:49,181 --> 00:29:49,422
Speaker 0: Yep.

514
00:29:49,482 --> 00:29:56,020
Speaker 0: Today was comic book day, and I went to the comic book store, and there's a 25 cent Penny Arcade comic.

515
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:56,711
Speaker 1: You bought how many?

516
00:29:56,814 --> 00:29:57,018
Speaker 1: Four?

517
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,745
Speaker 0: I bought four copies because it was freaking 25 cents.

518
00:29:59,785 --> 00:30:05,898
Speaker 0: I could have gotten more, but I figured, "Eh, my friends who don't go to the comic book store, they don't deserve it so

519
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:06,239
Speaker 0: much.".

520
00:30:07,442 --> 00:30:13,900
Speaker 0: There are going to be other people coming to this comic book store who want a copy, so I don't want to make it so they don't get one.

521
00:30:14,201 --> 00:30:15,580
Speaker 1: I gotta say, it's high quality.

522
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:17,120
Speaker 0: It's definitely high quality.

523
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,647
Speaker 1: It's not the beginning of Penny Arcade.

524
00:30:18,688 --> 00:30:21,139
Speaker 1: It picks up a little ways into it, which is probably good.

525
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:24,740
Speaker 1: And it's just an excellent selection of what makes Penny Arcade funny.

526
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,795
Speaker 0: It's an excellent, just, all it is, is from front to back, I think it's like 32 pages, almost?

527
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:39,616
Speaker 0: It feels like a 32 page comic of just Penny Arcade comics, three per page, really old comics.

528
00:30:39,636 --> 00:30:41,220
Speaker 0: We're talking Dreamcast times here.

529
00:30:42,983 --> 00:30:44,530
Speaker 0: Just, oh, bam, bam, bam.

530
00:30:44,751 --> 00:30:46,500
Speaker 0: And all of them are very choice comics.

531
00:30:46,822 --> 00:30:47,284
Speaker 1: And you know what?

532
00:30:47,325 --> 00:30:49,880
Speaker 1: There's only one ad on the whole thing, and it's on the back page.

533
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:54,379
Speaker 0: Yep, on the back cover is an ad for Aeon Flux, and that's the entire ad.

534
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,326
Speaker 0: And the comic costs 25 cents.

535
00:30:57,326 --> 00:31:02,380
Speaker 0: 25 cents for a comic book in a day when equivalent comic books cost like three bucks.

536
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,346
Speaker 1: And think about what a good business deal this was.

537
00:31:05,727 --> 00:31:07,491
Speaker 1: They give this comic away for free.

538
00:31:08,013 --> 00:31:10,960
Speaker 1: Now they charge a tiny amount of money for a tiny, it's free.

539
00:31:11,441 --> 00:31:13,319
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, the comic online is free, yeah.

540
00:31:13,861 --> 00:31:18,714
Speaker 1: Now they charge a tiny fee for a tiny glimpse of the old part of the comic on a little piece of paper.

541
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:20,760
Speaker 1: And I think it's going to sell out.

542
00:31:22,301 --> 00:31:22,362
Speaker 0: Yep.

543
00:31:22,382 --> 00:31:28,420
Speaker 0: Well, see, really, the reason that this is out is sort of consolation for the fact that the book didn't make it for the holidays.

544
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:28,814
Speaker 1: Yeah.

545
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,506
Speaker 0: But definitely a good consolation.

546
00:31:31,526 --> 00:31:33,131
Speaker 0: I'm sure the P.I.

547
00:31:33,151 --> 00:31:35,920
Speaker 0: guys are going to start making some serious green now.

548
00:31:36,161 --> 00:31:36,773
Speaker 0: You mean the P.A.

549
00:31:36,814 --> 00:31:37,099
Speaker 1: guys?

550
00:31:37,546 --> 00:31:37,799
Speaker 0: Yeah.

551
00:31:38,083 --> 00:31:38,276
Speaker 0: Yeah.

552
00:31:38,721 --> 00:31:43,118
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're going to make some serious money with this because I don't think this cost 25 cents to print.

553
00:31:43,138 --> 00:31:43,580
Speaker 0: What do you think?

554
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:44,307
Speaker 0: No.

555
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:45,061
Speaker 0: No.

556
00:31:45,441 --> 00:31:56,560
Speaker 0: Especially because, like, you look at a comic book today, the reason they cost three dollars is because they've got, like, a bunch of editors and they've got colorists and inkers and all this stuff.

557
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,221
Speaker 0: This?

558
00:31:57,521 --> 00:31:58,363
Speaker 0: They got none of that.

559
00:31:58,444 --> 00:32:00,368
Speaker 0: They didn't even have to make these comics.

560
00:32:00,408 --> 00:32:05,260
Speaker 0: They just took the comics right out of their freaking internet site.

561
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:11,580
Speaker 1: They probably sat down with Gabe for, like, a half hour to work out all the colorings since print is different from digital.

562
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,606
Speaker 0: No, the guys at Dark Horse Publishing probably did that.

563
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:19,940
Speaker 0: They just took all the comics, digitized them, one guy laid it out, and then they published it.

564
00:32:20,600 --> 00:32:21,886
Speaker 0: Oh, the guys' names are in here.

565
00:32:22,247 --> 00:32:25,120
Speaker 0: David Nistel and Mike Richardson designed and published it.

566
00:32:25,302 --> 00:32:25,538
Speaker 0: Great.

567
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:29,800
Speaker 0: And then those two guys just took the comics and made a thing and bam.

568
00:32:30,503 --> 00:32:31,940
Speaker 1: I'm definitely bringing this to work tomorrow.

569
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:33,520
Speaker 0: Oh, you're going to bring it to work, eh?

570
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:40,860
Speaker 1: Well, because I had a relevant Penny Arcade discussion at work, which gave me a legitimate reason to show someone, one of my coworkers, a Penny Arcade comic.

571
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:42,796
Speaker 0: Isn't Penny Arcade sort of NSFW?

572
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:57,320
Speaker 1: Uh, considering that IBM is a freaking huge company, they don't monitor everyone's internet, because they assume that if you're spending all day, you know, looking at websites or whatever, doing stupid things, you're probably going to get fired anyway for not doing your freaking job.

573
00:32:57,744 --> 00:32:58,340
Speaker 1: Ah, alright.

574
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:02,440
Speaker 1: Which I like that philosophy a lot, because I do my job very well, but I also occasionally read webcomics.

575
00:33:02,752 --> 00:33:02,898
Speaker 1: Yep.

576
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:10,560
Speaker 1: Well, we were talking over lunch about Wikipedia and anonymity and crapflutters and trolls and everything.

577
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:11,422
Speaker 0: Really?

578
00:33:11,483 --> 00:33:13,200
Speaker 0: Who's at work is smart enough to talk about that?

579
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:20,700
Speaker 1: Oh, because there was some article on actual news sites about how someone abused Wikipedia to put libelous things up about someone else.

580
00:33:21,061 --> 00:33:21,289
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

581
00:33:21,861 --> 00:33:27,138
Speaker 1: And there's this big scandal about it, and they were talking about how, "Oh, anonymity causes all the problems on the

582
00:33:27,158 --> 00:33:27,499
Speaker 1: internet.".

583
00:33:28,071 --> 00:33:28,199
Speaker 0: Yeah.

584
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:32,580
Speaker 1: And I directed my coworkers to John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory.

585
00:33:33,103 --> 00:33:34,760
Speaker 0: Ah, John Gabriel's Greater Internet Fuckwad Theory.

586
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:37,039
Speaker 1: I caused many people at my work to rofl uncontrollably.

587
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,559
Speaker 0: Of course they would rofl.

588
00:33:40,181 --> 00:33:43,060
Speaker 1: And they pretty much all agreed that that equation was in fact truth.

589
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:44,920
Speaker 0: That equation is in fact truth.

590
00:33:46,321 --> 00:33:50,180
Speaker 1: So for anyone who's not aware, I'll just post a link to it.

591
00:33:50,548 --> 00:33:50,677
Speaker 0: Yeah.

592
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:52,640
Speaker 1: No bother trying to explain a visual gag.

593
00:33:53,424 --> 00:33:56,438
Speaker 0: And, you know, for all you people who are like, "Oh, it's just a

594
00:33:56,499 --> 00:33:56,740
Speaker 0: theory.".

595
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,309
Speaker 0: Theory is huge.

596
00:33:58,490 --> 00:34:00,320
Speaker 0: Hypothesis is what's crap.

597
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:03,760
Speaker 0: I think we need to bring the word hypothesis back into the vocabulary.

598
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:04,454
Speaker 1: I think we do.

599
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,639
Speaker 0: Hypothesis is when you think something and you can't prove it yet.

600
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:08,080
Speaker 0: Yes.

601
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:12,000
Speaker 0: Theory is when you got some freaking evidence there.

602
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:12,621
Speaker 1: Theory is.

603
00:34:12,661 --> 00:34:19,360
Speaker 1: you've proven it as far as you can, and all new evidence continues to support it, and there have been zero contradicting pieces of evidence.

604
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:19,601
Speaker 0: Yeah.

605
00:34:20,022 --> 00:34:24,719
Speaker 0: Law is when you are like 100% sure there cannot be contradictory evidence.

606
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:25,261
Speaker 1: Sort of.

607
00:34:25,281 --> 00:34:25,804
Speaker 1: It's also more.

608
00:34:25,846 --> 00:34:26,612
Speaker 1: law is a postulate.

609
00:34:26,652 --> 00:34:27,699
Speaker 1: You're assuming it's true.

610
00:34:28,481 --> 00:34:28,721
Speaker 0: Yeah.

611
00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:30,728
Speaker 0: But law is like a super theory.

612
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:33,277
Speaker 0: Hypothesis is when you don't got crap.

613
00:34:33,357 --> 00:34:34,120
Speaker 0: You just got an idea.

614
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:38,380
Speaker 1: Or you got some evidence and it led you to a conclusion, and now you want to test that conclusion.

615
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,179
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't have enough evidence yet, so it's still hypothesis.

616
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,060
Speaker 1: See, that's the big problem with this whole intelligent design, stupid, whatever bullshit.

617
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:47,215
Speaker 0: Well, it's one of the problems is that they go, "Oh, it's just a

618
00:34:47,275 --> 00:34:47,618
Speaker 0: theory.".

619
00:34:47,699 --> 00:34:47,860
Speaker 0: No.

620
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:48,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, so is gravity.

621
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,594
Speaker 0: It's, "Oh, yeah, it's a freaking theory already.

622
00:34:51,635 --> 00:34:52,179
Speaker 0: Goddamn.".

623
00:34:52,443 --> 00:34:52,592
Speaker 0: Yeah.

624
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:56,437
Speaker 0: I mean, if you wanted to make fun of something, you would say, "Oh, it's just a

625
00:34:56,476 --> 00:34:57,040
Speaker 0: hypothesis."

626
00:34:57,241 --> 00:35:03,759
Speaker 0: And you would be right if, in fact, the thing you were making fun of was a hypothesis, because that's like saying, "You got no

627
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:03,960
Speaker 0: evidence.".

628
00:35:05,121 --> 00:35:10,340
Speaker 1: Well, I guess if we fail, we'll just have to start teaching the theory of intelligent falling, because gravity is just a theory.

629
00:35:10,762 --> 00:35:11,638
Speaker 0: Yep, it sure is.

630
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,779
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll do a podcast on this whole intelligent design thing.

631
00:35:15,423 --> 00:35:18,480
Speaker 0: Oh, we can do that when people come over who are all knowledgeable about that.

632
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've just got to find a creationist to argue with.

633
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, they don't like to argue, and they can't really argue straight.

634
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,618
Speaker 1: You want to pretend to be a creationist for us?

635
00:35:28,225 --> 00:35:28,897
Speaker 0: We'll try it right now.

636
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,900
Speaker 1: All right, so evolution happened.

637
00:35:33,343 --> 00:35:33,771
Speaker 0: No, it didn't.

638
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,740
Speaker 0: You're saying my dad's a monkey?

639
00:35:37,665 --> 00:35:38,440
Speaker 1: Here's all the evidence.

640
00:35:40,241 --> 00:35:41,794
Speaker 0: It's all lies made by evil scientists.

641
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:44,490
Speaker 1: Scientists aren't evil.

642
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,418
Speaker 1: Here's evidence of that.

643
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:47,640
Speaker 1: Cures for various diseases.

644
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:48,880
Speaker 0: God says otherwise.

645
00:35:50,306 --> 00:35:51,139
Speaker 1: I don't hear his voice.

646
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,317
Speaker 0: He told me.

647
00:35:54,643 --> 00:35:55,370
Speaker 1: How did he tell you?

648
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:56,320
Speaker 1: Hear voices in your head?

649
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:56,709
Speaker 0: Yep.

650
00:35:58,760 --> 00:35:59,750
Speaker 1: Great.

651
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:00,800
Speaker 1: Good luck with that.

652
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:02,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, good luck with your hell.

653
00:36:05,601 --> 00:36:10,500
Speaker 1: You know, I'd laugh, but at the same time, oh my god, there are people like that.

654
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:11,064
Speaker 0: Yeah.

655
00:36:12,024 --> 00:36:19,040
Speaker 1: I mean, way back, actually, when we first started doing the podcast, we wondered about how we should tread on controversial issues.

656
00:36:19,562 --> 00:36:20,940
Speaker 0: We didn't wonder about that.

657
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,079
Speaker 0: We knew that we were going to trample all over our side.

658
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:23,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we talked about it.

659
00:36:24,341 --> 00:36:25,799
Speaker 1: Were we going to avoid saying fuck?

660
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,560
Speaker 1: Were we going to specifically go for issues that might tick off our readers?

661
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,358
Speaker 1: What were we going to do?

662
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:36,039
Speaker 1: And you know what, we decided right away that we don't care, and our opinions are going to be well known.

663
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,760
Speaker 1: Intelligent design is bullshit.

664
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:40,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a real problem I see.

665
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 1: It's a valid philosophical idea.

666
00:36:43,163 --> 00:36:44,980
Speaker 1: It's definitely a valid philosophy.

667
00:36:46,542 --> 00:36:53,577
Speaker 1: It's not really a valid hypothesis because it's not testable, but philosophically it's fine, and I have no problem with people teaching it in a philosophy class or debating about it.

668
00:36:54,360 --> 00:36:55,208
Speaker 1: It's not science.

669
00:36:55,369 --> 00:36:57,458
Speaker 1: Anyone who says it is is stupid, and that's the end of that.

670
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:58,082
Speaker 0: Yeah.

671
00:36:58,727 --> 00:37:16,360
Speaker 0: I mean, I notice some podcasts, they try to stick to what their topic is, and they don't state their opinions about other things, or they'll always kind of not say anything super strongly because they want to get readership up and all that stuff, but Rym's writing something down.

672
00:37:16,845 --> 00:37:16,935
Speaker 0: Okay.

673
00:37:17,742 --> 00:37:19,659
Speaker 1: I'm just keeping track of what we've talked about.

674
00:37:20,121 --> 00:37:20,740
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

675
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:24,659
Speaker 1: You know, for all those links we post on the website, if any of you haven't visited yet, you should.

676
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:25,377
Speaker 0: Yeah.

677
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:27,119
Speaker 1: Because then you'll know more about what we're talking about.

678
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:40,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I figure, hey, this is the freaking point of having a podcast and not a real radio show or something real is that we can say whatever the fuck we want, and we're going to give it to you straight, and full on, no holding back.

679
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:41,361
Speaker 1: Yeah.

680
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:48,380
Speaker 1: I mean, even if somehow we got like crazy popular, you know, thousands and thousands of readers and all, or listeners, I guess readers too, we have a website.

681
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:48,585
Speaker 0: Yeah.

682
00:37:49,361 --> 00:37:56,940
Speaker 1: If some company sent us like an anime, and they're like, hey, review this, wink, wink, and there's $100 in it, I guess we're like Penny Arcade.

683
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:57,937
Speaker 1: We can't sell out.

684
00:37:58,746 --> 00:37:58,834
Speaker 1: Yeah.

685
00:37:59,201 --> 00:38:01,980
Speaker 1: It's painful for me to pretend I like something if I don't like it.

686
00:38:02,041 --> 00:38:05,300
Speaker 0: I'd take your $100 and watch your anime and give an honest freaking review.

687
00:38:06,121 --> 00:38:10,660
Speaker 0: And if it sucked, I'd say, wow, this freaking sucked, and these people gave me $100 thinking I would say it was great.

688
00:38:11,022 --> 00:38:11,111
Speaker 0: Yeah.

689
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,719
Speaker 1: We're real opinionated about a lot of things.

690
00:38:14,060 --> 00:38:14,141
Speaker 1: Yeah.

691
00:38:14,426 --> 00:38:22,919
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, I would not discourage any company from sending us free gadgets, comics, animes, video games.

692
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:23,282
Speaker 1: Oh, yes.

693
00:38:23,543 --> 00:38:27,660
Speaker 1: In fact, if we happen to get an Xbox 360 to review, that'd be just dandy.

694
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:28,382
Speaker 0: Yeah.

695
00:38:28,745 --> 00:38:30,520
Speaker 0: I mean, think about this.

696
00:38:31,023 --> 00:38:36,019
Speaker 0: If some guys who review everything perfectly honestly say your thing is awesome, that's huge.

697
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:43,379
Speaker 0: And if you send it to us, that's like, you know, you saying that you have great confidence in your product that we'll think it's awesome.

698
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:47,780
Speaker 1: Now, we're not saying us specifically so much as just people who are honest about things.

699
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:53,300
Speaker 1: Like Penny Arcade, I trust their opinions on games more than I trust my mom on advice.

700
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:55,979
Speaker 1: Penny Arcade is like the gospel of games.

701
00:38:56,322 --> 00:38:57,340
Speaker 1: They've never steered me wrong.

702
00:38:58,162 --> 00:39:00,319
Speaker 0: Well, you know, they play the wow, but they know.

703
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:01,022
Speaker 1: Yeah.

704
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:01,558
Speaker 1: Yeah, they know.

705
00:39:01,802 --> 00:39:02,074
Speaker 0: They know.

706
00:39:04,082 --> 00:39:06,520
Speaker 0: Anyway, today's technically Anime Manga Comics Day.

707
00:39:07,002 --> 00:39:08,597
Speaker 1: Well, it's Penny Arcade Comics.

708
00:39:08,617 --> 00:39:08,940
Speaker 1: We're good.

709
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:09,242
Speaker 0: Yeah.

710
00:39:09,866 --> 00:39:11,660
Speaker 0: But I did buy some other comics today.

711
00:39:12,143 --> 00:39:12,539
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

712
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,293
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I might, I don't know.

713
00:39:14,334 --> 00:39:17,820
Speaker 0: if people like this, I might start a weekly bit of What Comics Did Scott Buy?

714
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,719
Speaker 1: Consumer Whore?

715
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,800
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I go to the comic book store every Wednesday.

716
00:39:21,561 --> 00:39:22,859
Speaker 0: It's not really Consumer Whore.

717
00:39:23,506 --> 00:39:24,480
Speaker 0: It's I Have Lots of Money.

718
00:39:25,523 --> 00:39:28,639
Speaker 1: When you tell them the story about that zombie comic you read, you're a consumer whore.

719
00:39:30,020 --> 00:39:30,353
Speaker 0: Maybe, yeah.

720
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,498
Speaker 0: So anyway, I bought this.

721
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:44,460
Speaker 0: If you don't know, there are people, when it comes to American comic books, they're like, when someone buys a lot of Marvel comics or like they're a Marvel fanboy, you call them a Marvel zombie.

722
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:47,560
Speaker 0: That's kind of like the inside word for it, right?

723
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,216
Speaker 1: The more you know.

724
00:39:49,841 --> 00:39:50,374
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo.

725
00:39:50,802 --> 00:39:51,357
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo.

726
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:59,860
Speaker 0: So it was funny that a comic book came out today called Marvel Zombies, and it's basically, I mean, this thing looks like a freaking fanfic.

727
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:06,220
Speaker 0: It's like, ooh, all the Marvel superheroes are zombies, and here's a world in which they are zombies.

728
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,038
Speaker 0: Here's a comic.

729
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:07,673
Speaker 0: Read it.

730
00:40:08,220 --> 00:40:10,659
Speaker 0: And there's going to be five issues, so issue one was out today.

731
00:40:11,402 --> 00:40:13,820
Speaker 0: And I read it on the train home, and it was totally fan crap.

732
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:24,792
Speaker 0: I mean, you had Magneto here who was not a zombie, and everyone else was a zombie, inexplicably, and they're in a city, probably New York, and the other superheroes chase them down, and I think they eat them.

733
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:35,480
Speaker 0: And then they spend a whole bunch of pages where all the superheroes are discussing with each other their zombie condition, and that teaches you like the rules of zombie in this comic.

734
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,880
Speaker 0: You know, because every different zombie movie is different zombie rules, right?

735
00:40:39,561 --> 00:40:39,730
Speaker 0: You know?

736
00:40:40,120 --> 00:40:43,359
Speaker 1: Yeah, fast zombies, slow zombies, they turn you into zombies, they don't.

737
00:40:44,041 --> 00:40:45,817
Speaker 0: Yeah, they talked a lot about these.

738
00:40:45,837 --> 00:40:48,420
Speaker 0: zombies are apparently zombies that hunger but cannot be fulfilled.

739
00:40:48,871 --> 00:40:49,240
Speaker 1: Ah, okay.

740
00:40:50,042 --> 00:41:02,275
Speaker 0: And then, on the final pages, something happened, and I wasn't going to buy another one of these comics because it was obvious fan crap, but what they did on the last page was just like, "God damn it, now I have to read the freaking next

741
00:41:02,416 --> 00:41:02,497
Speaker 0: one.".

742
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:04,839
Speaker 0: Such bastards.

743
00:41:05,580 --> 00:41:13,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think I'm going to let him spoil it for you, but he told me because I didn't care, and I had to read the whole thing, and then I saw that last page, I'd buy the next one.

744
00:41:15,241 --> 00:41:23,399
Speaker 0: It was a comic book about nothing, and then they put a picture of a character on the last couple pages, and it makes you have to buy the next one.

745
00:41:23,580 --> 00:41:25,480
Speaker 1: So, once again, I assert consumer whore.

746
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the rest of the stuff I didn't buy was consumer whore.

747
00:41:28,622 --> 00:41:30,599
Speaker 0: I bought the Penny Arcade comic, four copies of it.

748
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:31,224
Speaker 1: 25 cents, man.

749
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:33,298
Speaker 1: I owe you a quarter for it.

750
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:33,737
Speaker 0: Yep.

751
00:41:35,241 --> 00:41:37,259
Speaker 0: I got Sentinel volume two, issue two.

752
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:46,059
Speaker 0: Sentinel is sort of like a kid's comic, you know, and you get a little bit ashamed to buy it, but I really like the Sentinel robots, you know, the ones that kill mutants.

753
00:41:46,483 --> 00:41:48,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember the X-Men TV cartoon?

754
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, the purple guys.

755
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,538
Speaker 0: The big robot guys.

756
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:53,520
Speaker 1: The ones that try to kill Jubilee every frickin' episode.

757
00:41:53,740 --> 00:42:05,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically the story is that some kid, he's just a high school kid, and you know, he's got some high school drama, and he finds a Sentinel, and since he knows a lot about robots and tech, he kind of controls the Sentinel and does stuff.

758
00:42:06,781 --> 00:42:23,879
Speaker 0: And the second volume is not as good as the first volume, but I'm buying it because I want to support this kind of comic because you don't see Marvel, or especially not DC, making comics that at least they think are in a sort of manga style.

759
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:30,300
Speaker 1: It seems to be in the same manga style that like Teen Titans was, though.

760
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:43,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's sort of like that kind of thing, where it's not really a manga, and it's not really manga style, but Marvel thinks it is, and you know, so if I support that kind of comic, then they'll keep going in that direction.

761
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:47,039
Speaker 0: And it seems to work, because they're making a volume too, here it is.

762
00:42:47,300 --> 00:42:50,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even if they don't in the long term, manga's just going to go in that direction.

763
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:58,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I bought it kind of like a vote, even though the second volume not as good as the first volume.

764
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:01,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't buy the next volume of Cantarella.

765
00:43:02,643 --> 00:43:04,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not out, but I wouldn't buy either.

766
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:08,580
Speaker 0: Unless you really want to give that vote for Yaoi.

767
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:10,899
Speaker 1: Hey, it's not actually Yaoi.

768
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:19,620
Speaker 1: In fact, while it is probably the most homoerotically charged piece of literature I've ever read, there is in fact no boy action at all.

769
00:43:19,960 --> 00:43:20,552
Speaker 0: It's just Shonen Ai.

770
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:21,886
Speaker 1: Not even.

771
00:43:21,906 --> 00:43:25,919
Speaker 1: It's just innuendo, and guys standing there talking about swords.

772
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,839
Speaker 0: Isn't that what Shonen Ai is?

773
00:43:28,141 --> 00:43:30,360
Speaker 1: No, Shonen Ai is when boys actually like each other.

774
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:31,979
Speaker 1: These boys don't like each other.

775
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:34,720
Speaker 0: So it's not even up to gravitation's level.

776
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:41,960
Speaker 1: Imagine it's the most sexual tension you can have in a homoerotic situation, where there is absolutely no homoeroticism whatsoever.

777
00:43:42,101 --> 00:43:43,499
Speaker 0: Well, you have to see volume two.

778
00:43:44,182 --> 00:43:44,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

779
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:49,100
Speaker 0: I only bought two other comics, but they were the big trade paperback ones.

780
00:43:49,963 --> 00:43:56,553
Speaker 0: I like to save money, and since I have a lot of money, I can afford to buy a $15 thing, especially if it's cheaper than eight $3 things.

781
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:07,639
Speaker 0: So the first one I got was Marvel Team-Up Trade Paperback #1, and I wouldn't have gotten this, this is something that I would never have looked at or bought ever.

782
00:44:08,281 --> 00:44:12,373
Speaker 0: Except the guys on the Comic Geek Speak podcast told me to get it.

783
00:44:13,081 --> 00:44:15,319
Speaker 0: So I got it, and if it sucks, I'm gonna yell at them.

784
00:44:16,222 --> 00:44:20,359
Speaker 0: And if it doesn't suck, well, then they're a bunch of bastards for making me buy another comic book.

785
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:26,980
Speaker 0: Basically, it's this continuous story that's sort of on its own, which is what I like.

786
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:29,300
Speaker 0: I don't like any stories that tie between comic books.

787
00:44:29,763 --> 00:44:32,540
Speaker 0: I could do a whole podcast about hating frickin' crossovers.

788
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:36,838
Speaker 0: But in each issue, there are two Marvel superheroes that team up.

789
00:44:37,825 --> 00:44:40,000
Speaker 0: And it's two different superheroes each issue.

790
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:40,727
Speaker 0: So it's like...

791
00:44:41,500 --> 00:44:42,899
Speaker 1: Randomly, is there a reason they team up?

792
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:51,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, each comic book itself is a story of how two superheroes team up, and then I guess un-team up at the end.

793
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:52,620
Speaker 0: I don't know, I have to read it still.

794
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:55,239
Speaker 1: Well, I guess my only other question, are villains involved in this too?

795
00:44:55,481 --> 00:44:56,378
Speaker 0: Oh, of course there are villains.

796
00:44:57,642 --> 00:45:00,419
Speaker 0: Each comic book has two heroes that team up in it.

797
00:45:01,021 --> 00:45:04,620
Speaker 0: And there's still a story that carries out between all the comics.

798
00:45:05,149 --> 00:45:05,212
Speaker 1: Huh.

799
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:08,300
Speaker 0: So I have to read it to get more details.

800
00:45:08,721 --> 00:45:12,159
Speaker 0: And if it's good, I'll buy the second trade paperback, probably next week.

801
00:45:12,923 --> 00:45:14,639
Speaker 0: And yeah, I could tell you all about it then.

802
00:45:15,821 --> 00:45:18,820
Speaker 0: The last thing I bought is this comic book called Preacher.

803
00:45:19,081 --> 00:45:20,380
Speaker 0: I got the second trade paperback.

804
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:27,520
Speaker 0: Now, Preacher is one of them vertigo books, like Fables and Why the Last Man and all those.

805
00:45:28,542 --> 00:45:31,577
Speaker 0: And it's about this guy who's a preacher in Texas.

806
00:45:33,401 --> 00:45:39,959
Speaker 0: And it deals with, like, you know, there's actually a God, there's actually a heaven and all that jazz, you know.

807
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,456
Speaker 0: But the story is that God is missing.

808
00:45:43,321 --> 00:45:43,778
Speaker 0: He, like, left.

809
00:45:44,382 --> 00:45:44,549
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

810
00:45:45,041 --> 00:45:46,680
Speaker 0: And these angels were left in charge.

811
00:45:46,860 --> 00:45:50,000
Speaker 0: You know, of course there's a whole host of heaven with different groups of angels and crap.

812
00:45:50,801 --> 00:45:55,920
Speaker 0: And there was this thing called Genesis, which is like the son of, like, a devil and an archangel or something.

813
00:45:56,741 --> 00:45:59,100
Speaker 0: And it got loose, and it entered this preacher.

814
00:45:59,784 --> 00:46:02,419
Speaker 0: And now the preacher has this power called the Word of God.

815
00:46:03,243 --> 00:46:06,660
Speaker 0: And he basically looks at you, and his eyes turn red, and he says something.

816
00:46:07,080 --> 00:46:10,918
Speaker 0: Usually he says, "Drop the gun," or "Go fuck

817
00:46:10,938 --> 00:46:11,319
Speaker 0: yourself."

818
00:46:12,445 --> 00:46:15,599
Speaker 0: And then whoever he says it to does exactly what he said.

819
00:46:16,861 --> 00:46:27,360
Speaker 0: And it gets kind of gory sometimes, and it's really serious and dark and cool and sort of Western-ish, you know, really serious.

820
00:46:28,045 --> 00:46:29,899
Speaker 0: And it's pretty freaking cool.

821
00:46:31,682 --> 00:46:33,940
Speaker 1: I've been meaning to read it, actually, but I haven't gotten around to it.

822
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:34,760
Speaker 1: I've been playing Mario Kart.

823
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:40,300
Speaker 0: It's very critically acclaimed, and I can see why.

824
00:46:42,263 --> 00:46:50,820
Speaker 0: I don't think my like of it equals the critical acclaim, but I'm probably going to buy all of it unless it all of a sudden turns to crap.

825
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:51,425
Speaker 1: Oh, good.

826
00:46:51,446 --> 00:46:52,118
Speaker 1: Then I'll get to read it.

827
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:52,486
Speaker 1: Yeah.

828
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:59,560
Speaker 0: I would definitely recommend that anyone with enough money buy at least the first two volumes.

829
00:47:00,461 --> 00:47:02,677
Speaker 0: And if you don't like it after that, you can do whatever, but...

830
00:47:03,140 --> 00:47:03,272
Speaker 1: Yeah.

831
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:07,380
Speaker 0: I mean, there are people out there who don't like Watchmen, and that is super critically acclaimed.

832
00:47:10,669 --> 00:47:10,991
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

833
00:47:11,011 --> 00:47:12,240
Speaker 0: I think that's all I bought.

834
00:47:12,481 --> 00:47:12,605
Speaker 0: Yep.

835
00:47:12,646 --> 00:47:12,853
Speaker 0: Yep.

836
00:47:14,241 --> 00:47:15,228
Speaker 1: That's about all we've got, so...

837
00:47:17,226 --> 00:47:18,300
Speaker 0: Peace out, homies.

838
00:47:25,303 --> 00:47:27,420
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
