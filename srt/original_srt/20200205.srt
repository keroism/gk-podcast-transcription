1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,351
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, February 5th, 2020.

2
00:00:12,351 --> 00:00:12,772
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,873 --> 00:00:13,334
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,414 --> 00:00:19,179
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights Tonight Weathering With You, a film by Makoto Shinkai.

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:21,958
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,042
Speaker 1: I just want to point out that, uh, you know in Geek Nights we always have this thing at the beginning of the show where we just talk about something like, "I was

7
00:00:32,103 --> 00:00:32,786
Speaker 1: bikin'!"

8
00:00:32,826 --> 00:00:33,429
Speaker 1: or "I ate a good

9
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:33,892
Speaker 1: food!"

10
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:35,500
Speaker 1: like whatever, like stuff, like the banter.

11
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:39,740
Speaker 0: Usually, usually it's something that we sit down to do the show and someone just remembers.

12
00:00:40,302 --> 00:00:42,612
Speaker 0: We try to remember something recent or from the day.

13
00:00:42,713 --> 00:00:44,159
Speaker 1: Like, "Did anything happen to

14
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:44,360
Speaker 1: me?".

15
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,212
Speaker 0: But sometimes something happens and you're like, "That was a thing.

16
00:00:48,272 --> 00:00:48,935
Speaker 0: I can't forget.

17
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:50,400
Speaker 0: the next Geek Nights is far away.

18
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:55,456
Speaker 0: I must tell the other person or perhaps digitally record to remember because remember the

19
00:00:55,476 --> 00:00:55,757
Speaker 0: thing.".

20
00:00:55,877 --> 00:00:56,700
Speaker 1: We are like fish.

21
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:04,988
Speaker 1: No matter how, if something amazing happens to either of us and then something else happens before we do the next Geek Nights, whatever that amazing thing was, it's just gone.

22
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:05,431
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:07,300
Speaker 1: Gone forever, like tears in the rain.

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,329
Speaker 0: All right, so I managed to remember a thing.

25
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:11,840
Speaker 0: So I went to this, they're in Queens, right?

26
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:14,810
Speaker 0: They're changing all the bus routes like from scratch.

27
00:01:15,332 --> 00:01:17,660
Speaker 0: So the MTA is like, "All right, erase the bus map.

28
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:28,568
Speaker 0: Let's draw a new bus route map from nothing to be as good as possible and then let's go out and see what the people think and then let's do workshops and we'll work on it for like a year or

29
00:01:28,628 --> 00:01:28,909
Speaker 0: so.".

30
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:33,458
Speaker 1: And then we're like, "This is real important 'cause Queens like buses are real important in New

31
00:01:33,498 --> 00:01:33,660
Speaker 1: York.".

32
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:42,728
Speaker 0: If you aren't close enough to walk to the subway or the subway near you doesn't go where you want to go, right, the bus is real important.

33
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:45,160
Speaker 0: As some neighborhoods, like there is just no subway.

34
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:45,525
Speaker 0: Yeah.

35
00:01:45,545 --> 00:01:46,418
Speaker 0: If you don't have a car.

36
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:50,420
Speaker 1: Part of why my rent is so high is while I have a- You don't want to take a cab everywhere.

37
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:59,714
Speaker 1: My apartment costs more than Scotts and is not as nice as Scotts, but because it's next to a subway station, like that's the selling point.

38
00:01:59,815 --> 00:02:01,280
Speaker 0: Only by a few blocks.

39
00:02:02,301 --> 00:02:07,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I go to this local townie community government meeting, right?

40
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,732
Speaker 0: You know, a state senator, not my state senator, but the adjacent state senator.

41
00:02:12,495 --> 00:02:14,000
Speaker 0: This badass lady, she's there.

42
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,845
Speaker 1: But still, think about this.

43
00:02:15,906 --> 00:02:22,758
Speaker 1: This is like the local town discussion for a borough of a city that itself has 2.2 million people in it.

44
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,830
Speaker 0: Well, no, one neighborhood of Queens.

45
00:02:26,251 --> 00:02:28,760
Speaker 0: It was just like Astoria, you know, only.

46
00:02:28,983 --> 00:02:30,360
Speaker 1: So, okay, so let's see.

47
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:35,300
Speaker 0: So, it filled the meeting room of an old folks home full of folding chairs, right?

48
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:35,882
Speaker 0: Alright.

49
00:02:36,264 --> 00:02:38,155
Speaker 1: So, a neighborhood that has 10,000 people in it.

50
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:42,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, like it would be like the equivalent- Wait, no, that's a different Astoria.

51
00:02:42,347 --> 00:02:43,232
Speaker 1: That's Astoria, Oregon.

52
00:02:43,272 --> 00:02:44,540
Speaker 1: I was about to say 10,000 seem low.

53
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:45,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's way low.

54
00:02:46,721 --> 00:02:47,468
Speaker 1: A neighborhood of 120,000 people.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,269
Speaker 0: Right, yeah.

56
00:02:51,309 --> 00:02:54,160
Speaker 0: So, I go, you know, the local politicians are there, right?

57
00:02:54,822 --> 00:02:59,799
Speaker 0: My city councilman, who is trying to become borough president, shows up for five minutes and leaves, right?

58
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:04,954
Speaker 0: You know, my Albany representative in the assembly, she's there.

59
00:03:04,994 --> 00:03:06,277
Speaker 0: She's got plenty of time.

60
00:03:06,298 --> 00:03:08,044
Speaker 1: I always see her- I like to go to things like this.

61
00:03:08,165 --> 00:03:11,420
Speaker 1: I always wanted to when we lived upstate, but they always scheduled them while I was at work.

62
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,779
Speaker 1: That's how only old people could go.

63
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,620
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is I had to go because MTA representatives are there and I need to use this bus.

64
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:18,067
Speaker 0: Yup.

65
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:21,272
Speaker 0: And, you know, I had to find out the info about this bus.

66
00:03:21,332 --> 00:03:23,140
Speaker 0: It was kind of important to my everyday life.

67
00:03:23,221 --> 00:03:25,620
Speaker 0: So, that'll get you out of the house to go to a townie thing.

68
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:28,800
Speaker 1: Yup, and they're going to like every, like there's a million of these meetings.

69
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,610
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there's tons of them, right?

70
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,220
Speaker 0: And there have been a bunch before, right?

71
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,638
Speaker 0: So, first of all, right, as you would expect what the composition of the room, whatever you're imagining the composition of the room to be, right?

72
00:03:41,023 --> 00:03:42,320
Speaker 0: Add some diversity because it's Queens.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,580
Speaker 1: Yup, I imagine a lot of angry old people yelling about nonsense.

74
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:50,280
Speaker 0: Remember, it is in an old folks home and yeah, at least half old folks.

75
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:50,660
Speaker 0: Yeah.

76
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:56,740
Speaker 0: Right, but yeah, you know, you have people who with reasonable complaint, right?

77
00:03:57,064 --> 00:03:57,176
Speaker 0: Yup.

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:00,400
Speaker 0: Almost, I thought I was going to be one of the only people there.

79
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,040
Speaker 0: I was like, man, I have to go because it's the meetings like in sort of near where I used to live, closer to the subway.

80
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:10,839
Speaker 0: I got to make sure there's some representation from Western Queens who are taking away this one bus.

81
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, Western Queens is growing like in population.

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,312
Speaker 0: From people near the water, right?

83
00:04:15,332 --> 00:04:16,300
Speaker 0: They're taking away this bus.

84
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:19,860
Speaker 0: I got to go and be like, hey, don't take away this bus, right?

85
00:04:20,202 --> 00:04:21,719
Speaker 1: Even I care about this bus.

86
00:04:22,383 --> 00:04:23,580
Speaker 0: Me, the rim who hates buses.

87
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:25,240
Speaker 0: I don't think you've ever taken the 103 in your life.

88
00:04:25,584 --> 00:04:26,219
Speaker 1: I think I have.

89
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:30,520
Speaker 0: You would need it if you wanted to go to the Astoria ferry, but you just go to the LIC ferry.

90
00:04:31,867 --> 00:04:32,080
Speaker 0: Anyway.

91
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,000
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm thinking of the bus that took me to College Point.

92
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:34,820
Speaker 1: It's not the 103.

93
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,980
Speaker 0: I don't know what bus you're talking about.

94
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:41,460
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I'm thinking I'm going to be the ones like represent that bus, right?

95
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:43,800
Speaker 0: And, you know, be like, hey, we got to get to the water.

96
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:47,820
Speaker 0: How can I get to the, you know, my city councilman.

97
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:51,280
Speaker 0: The first thing he says is like, yeah, 103, what the hell?

98
00:04:52,102 --> 00:04:59,595
Speaker 0: And then the MTA guy, before he even starts, he's like, all right, who here is here to complain about the 103 and the 90% of the rumors.

99
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:04,020
Speaker 0: He's like, he's like, the ridership has been real low.

100
00:05:04,201 --> 00:05:07,040
Speaker 0: And I'm like, yeah, it's because you only run that off.

101
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:08,259
Speaker 0: You only run it that often.

102
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:10,339
Speaker 0: So everyone doesn't bother to wait for it.

103
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:15,080
Speaker 0: It's a, you know, it's a induced demand or, you know, the opposite of induced demand.

104
00:05:15,141 --> 00:05:16,879
Speaker 0: When you make something sucks and no one uses it.

105
00:05:17,741 --> 00:05:20,040
Speaker 1: Most mass transit in America has that problem.

106
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:22,053
Speaker 1: They make it suck and then no one rides it.

107
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,999
Speaker 1: But if they made it better, everyone would ride it.

108
00:05:25,340 --> 00:05:25,440
Speaker 0: Right.

109
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:36,419
Speaker 0: So anyway, so the funny comment number one that I heard at least two or three times was angry, really somewhat angry, really upset and frustrated person.

110
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,499
Speaker 0: be like, you know, you guys, how can you put this on us?

111
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:42,438
Speaker 0: You know, changing all the bus routes we depend on.

112
00:05:43,183 --> 00:05:44,479
Speaker 0: You don't come to the community.

113
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:47,620
Speaker 0: It's like they're literally coming to the community.

114
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:47,942
Speaker 0: Right.

115
00:05:48,245 --> 00:05:49,800
Speaker 0: This is them coming to the community.

116
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:52,259
Speaker 0: They already said this is like a draft.

117
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:56,179
Speaker 0: And this not what won't happen this year and might not even happen next year.

118
00:05:56,524 --> 00:05:57,599
Speaker 0: And they're still working on it.

119
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,360
Speaker 0: And here they are to hear what you have to say of their just first draft.

120
00:06:01,501 --> 00:06:08,180
Speaker 0: And this they explained how they came up with it, trying to make buses straighter and have less traffic and all that, you know, right.

121
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,160
Speaker 0: They explained to you the whole thing and they're here to hear from you.

122
00:06:11,301 --> 00:06:13,218
Speaker 0: And people like, how come you don't come in here from us?

123
00:06:14,002 --> 00:06:18,300
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, multiple people said that this is why I don't trust people.

124
00:06:18,641 --> 00:06:21,280
Speaker 0: And these are and those are people who go to a community meeting.

125
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,719
Speaker 0: One hundred percent of that room was voted.

126
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:23,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, for sure.

127
00:06:23,707 --> 00:06:24,856
Speaker 0: So, yeah.

128
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:33,536
Speaker 0: Anyway, the one comment that was just I could not ignore that makes it open a bit worthy was some crazy dude.

129
00:06:33,838 --> 00:06:34,040
Speaker 0: Right.

130
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:34,764
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

131
00:06:34,784 --> 00:06:36,259
Speaker 0: He was recording the meeting on his iPad.

132
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:37,004
Speaker 1: Whoa.

133
00:06:37,146 --> 00:06:37,287
Speaker 1: OK.

134
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:38,339
Speaker 0: All right.

135
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:40,098
Speaker 0: It's an important meeting on his iPad.

136
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:40,300
Speaker 0: Right.

137
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,206
Speaker 0: He's recording everything.

138
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:43,220
Speaker 1: Well, he's he's making his kill list, probably.

139
00:06:43,341 --> 00:06:44,407
Speaker 0: I don't know what this guy's doing.

140
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:47,869
Speaker 0: So he's like, he's like, it tastes like I've been to all these meetings.

141
00:06:47,889 --> 00:06:51,269
Speaker 0: This guy's going around to MTA meetings, like all of them, apparently.

142
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:53,440
Speaker 1: I mean, I could see myself doing that.

143
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:57,760
Speaker 0: And he says, how come you don't answer the question right that we all want answered?

144
00:06:58,081 --> 00:06:59,531
Speaker 0: He's like, you never answer us.

145
00:06:59,974 --> 00:07:00,779
Speaker 0: And I'm like, us who?

146
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:01,503
Speaker 1: Yeah.

147
00:07:01,523 --> 00:07:02,277
Speaker 0: Speak for yourself, bro.

148
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:03,267
Speaker 0: Right.

149
00:07:03,328 --> 00:07:04,038
Speaker 0: The royal us.

150
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:09,620
Speaker 0: And he starts talking about something that is a true, but I didn't know it until now.

151
00:07:10,202 --> 00:07:12,191
Speaker 0: And then be completely crazy after that.

152
00:07:12,472 --> 00:07:14,782
Speaker 0: He starts off completely true and I learned something.

153
00:07:15,324 --> 00:07:17,273
Speaker 0: So he's valuable education.

154
00:07:17,694 --> 00:07:18,880
Speaker 0: And then he goes off the deep end.

155
00:07:19,247 --> 00:07:19,452
Speaker 0: All right.

156
00:07:19,493 --> 00:07:19,698
Speaker 0: Right.

157
00:07:20,101 --> 00:07:27,159
Speaker 0: So he starts and he talks about, uh, when they, you know, when Bloomberg conglomerated the buses and I'm like, what?

158
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,719
Speaker 0: Well, so we always talk about how the subway has like the IRT.

159
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:35,320
Speaker 0: They used to be the IRT and the BMD independent line.

160
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:35,942
Speaker 0: Right.

161
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:38,960
Speaker 0: The buses used to be all private buses.

162
00:07:39,962 --> 00:07:45,015
Speaker 0: And they were not combined into the MTA until like, yes, Bloomberg, like 2005, six, seven.

163
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,079
Speaker 1: Which is probably another reason why our buses kind of.

164
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:53,740
Speaker 0: There were buses like queen surface and they'd said queen surface on them.

165
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:57,260
Speaker 0: And that was a bus and it wasn't a public bus also.

166
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:58,162
Speaker 0: Right.

167
00:07:58,283 --> 00:07:59,047
Speaker 0: I didn't know this.

168
00:07:59,489 --> 00:08:03,049
Speaker 0: Some of the buses that still run that look, they just look like a city bus.

169
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:03,674
Speaker 0: You get on them.

170
00:08:03,734 --> 00:08:04,420
Speaker 0: It's a city bus.

171
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,625
Speaker 0: You use your Metro card.

172
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:06,389
Speaker 0: It looks perfect.

173
00:08:06,429 --> 00:08:08,559
Speaker 0: It looks like it's a public bus in all ways.

174
00:08:09,143 --> 00:08:12,160
Speaker 0: Is operated by a private bus company, right?

175
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,318
Speaker 1: Like the early days of the IRT being run by the MTA.

176
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,580
Speaker 0: It would be as if there was still an IRT company.

177
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,200
Speaker 0: And there was people working there and they, and they operated trains.

178
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:23,162
Speaker 0: Right.

179
00:08:23,283 --> 00:08:30,659
Speaker 0: That said on them, MTA, New York city transit subway, but there's a private company being paid to operate them.

180
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,122
Speaker 0: Right.

181
00:08:31,142 --> 00:08:32,900
Speaker 0: So there's still buses like that somewhere.

182
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:33,482
Speaker 0: Right.

183
00:08:34,085 --> 00:08:45,200
Speaker 0: So apparently what happened is they bought out all these private bus companies and incorporated them into this MTA bus company, but there's actually two bus companies and there was some shenanigans.

184
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:48,100
Speaker 0: There's like M. they formed the MTA bus company.

185
00:08:48,343 --> 00:08:49,152
Speaker 0: And then this other one.

186
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:49,699
Speaker 1: All right.

187
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,539
Speaker 0: So I learned all that stuff from this dude.

188
00:08:51,741 --> 00:09:04,060
Speaker 0: But then this dude went off the rails with some, not, you know, not as crazy as a sovereign citizen saying the law doesn't matter, but possibly making up things out of whole cloth.

189
00:09:05,001 --> 00:09:06,994
Speaker 1: He said, might just be an R W N J.

190
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,522
Speaker 0: I don't know.

191
00:09:08,583 --> 00:09:21,120
Speaker 0: But he said that when the buses were all combined, right, there was some agreement that they would not remove bus lines or merge them into New York city transit.

192
00:09:21,261 --> 00:09:26,400
Speaker 0: And therefore the MTA doesn't have the power to redo all the bus routes.

193
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:27,163
Speaker 0: Right.

194
00:09:27,243 --> 00:09:30,940
Speaker 0: It could be sued by the union if the union wanted to Sue or something.

195
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,444
Speaker 1: Okay.

196
00:09:32,504 --> 00:09:36,783
Speaker 0: And I was like, uh, and then the MTA guy obviously doesn't answer the question.

197
00:09:36,803 --> 00:09:38,419
Speaker 1: Well, the MTA guy is probably just like waiting.

198
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:46,680
Speaker 0: Like I recognize that the MTA guy obviously had heard the same guy several times before and is not as a bus route expert and not a lawyer for the MTA.

199
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:49,760
Speaker 1: Pretty sure that guy is going to be in long Island city tonight.

200
00:09:50,464 --> 00:09:51,596
Speaker 1: Oh, they're doing ours tonight.

201
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:51,960
Speaker 1: Okay.

202
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,399
Speaker 1: At six, I could miss a missus happening right now.

203
00:09:54,822 --> 00:09:56,959
Speaker 1: That guy is probably right now at Jacob Reese.

204
00:09:58,062 --> 00:10:00,260
Speaker 0: Well, there's like a long presentation before question time.

205
00:10:00,522 --> 00:10:02,440
Speaker 1: He's sitting in the audience with his iPad right now waiting.

206
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:09,108
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is that, uh, the MTA guy was just like, yeah, I can't answer any questions about that.

207
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:19,025
Speaker 0: We're here to talk about these bus routes and whether the new routes work for you or if you want, you know, how you think we should adjust them or change them or make new ones or what's missing, you know?

208
00:10:19,045 --> 00:10:33,468
Speaker 0: Uh, but it's like most of the people were just like, you know, they would, you know, regardless of how they would ask their question, like, you know, some exasperated person was like, uh, I have to go to mass, but then you took away the mass bus or you're not connecting the neighborhood.

209
00:10:33,488 --> 00:10:34,800
Speaker 0: These neighborhoods have a connection.

210
00:10:35,982 --> 00:10:41,669
Speaker 0: And the MTA guy is just like, all right, so we need, we still need a connection between Astoria and mass bath.

211
00:10:41,689 --> 00:10:42,091
Speaker 0: I gotcha.

212
00:10:42,936 --> 00:10:51,011
Speaker 0: He would just, he would just extract the actual route related suggestion from whatever crazy long rant he had to listen to.

213
00:10:51,413 --> 00:10:53,966
Speaker 0: And then you're like, okay, you want to route to mass bed?

214
00:10:54,047 --> 00:10:54,329
Speaker 0: Okay.

215
00:10:54,872 --> 00:10:57,705
Speaker 0: And he would just quietly listen while the person ran it, whoever long.

216
00:10:57,725 --> 00:11:08,470
Speaker 0: Uh, and that was that, but yeah, crazy dude is no matter what thing is being discussed at the townie meeting, there's always going to be some crazy person.

217
00:11:08,752 --> 00:11:09,013
Speaker 1: Yup.

218
00:11:09,515 --> 00:11:14,392
Speaker 1: I, uh, my few experiences going to state good fight.

219
00:11:14,432 --> 00:11:14,874
Speaker 1: Same.

220
00:11:15,195 --> 00:11:23,848
Speaker 0: I did a cursory internet search and I could find nothing about an agreement not to move, emerge, or it is very sovereign.

221
00:11:23,929 --> 00:11:28,631
Speaker 0: It's always this idea, like who's someone who thinks they know some laws.

222
00:11:28,912 --> 00:11:29,133
Speaker 0: Yup.

223
00:11:29,234 --> 00:11:30,340
Speaker 0: This is a made up stuff.

224
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,123
Speaker 1: Well, it's all.

225
00:11:31,144 --> 00:11:34,039
Speaker 0: therefore it's always, there is a do this and that.

226
00:11:34,099 --> 00:11:34,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

227
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:38,938
Speaker 1: It's always, there is a technicality that is too difficult to explain.

228
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:42,677
Speaker 1: that therefore undermines the legitimacy of a very legitimate.

229
00:11:42,718 --> 00:11:43,904
Speaker 0: I'll say some magic words.

230
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:46,034
Speaker 0: Now the government has to do a thing, right?

231
00:11:46,777 --> 00:11:48,445
Speaker 1: I did not make rejoinder with this bus.

232
00:11:49,329 --> 00:11:51,620
Speaker 1: I am a prime, a free man traveling on the land.

233
00:11:51,900 --> 00:12:01,986
Speaker 0: And obviously what he was saying was less crazy than what actual sovereign citizens say, but it was still, but it's the same sort of logic of magic words made up thing.

234
00:12:02,428 --> 00:12:09,276
Speaker 1: Therefore law, you can't do it when people like that, like, especially in this case, like what does he want?

235
00:12:09,517 --> 00:12:11,546
Speaker 1: Because you don't want independent bus lines.

236
00:12:11,586 --> 00:12:12,470
Speaker 1: That's garbage.

237
00:12:12,912 --> 00:12:16,527
Speaker 1: Like you want one cop thing to run all the mass transit.

238
00:12:16,548 --> 00:12:16,889
Speaker 1: Right.

239
00:12:16,929 --> 00:12:18,154
Speaker 1: But here's the thing, right?

240
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:29,180
Speaker 0: So if they had a subway, like kind of like has problems because of this, well, it's like, you know, okay, we have, but we, they're trying to improve the bus line, whether they're doing a good job or not is debatable.

241
00:12:29,381 --> 00:12:29,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

242
00:12:29,722 --> 00:12:29,883
Speaker 0: There's.

243
00:12:29,984 --> 00:12:31,210
Speaker 0: obviously it's not perfect.

244
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:32,437
Speaker 0: It's also a first draft.

245
00:12:32,839 --> 00:12:39,960
Speaker 0: If they just had a meeting to come and say, suggest changes to the current bus line, there would be a packed meeting of the same crazy ranting people.

246
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:40,281
Speaker 0: Yup.

247
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:40,684
Speaker 0: Right.

248
00:12:40,804 --> 00:12:43,459
Speaker 0: So why, if they have a meeting, we're going to change it.

249
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:46,234
Speaker 0: People come crazy and rant, put it back the way it was.

250
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:46,877
Speaker 0: Okay.

251
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:57,499
Speaker 0: So if you say, put it back the way it was and make no changes and leave everything as is, then I expect if we have a meeting on how to change the current bus line, we're going to, or otherwise you're leaving it the way it is.

252
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,380
Speaker 0: I expect you to stay home because you think the current bus line is perfect.

253
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:01,802
Speaker 0: Great.

254
00:13:01,842 --> 00:13:05,063
Speaker 1: They want everything to be different and they want nothing to change.

255
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:05,606
Speaker 0: Exactly.

256
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:08,038
Speaker 0: The same person would complain at both meetings.

257
00:13:08,178 --> 00:13:11,700
Speaker 0: In my experience, these people, how come the bus doesn't come enough, right?

258
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:15,731
Speaker 0: We're going to change the routes and hopefully try to fix some of these problems and work with DOT maybe.

259
00:13:15,872 --> 00:13:16,275
Speaker 0: No change.

260
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,502
Speaker 0: How come you're changing the bus line?

261
00:13:17,542 --> 00:13:19,170
Speaker 0: What am I life undoing my life?

262
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:20,456
Speaker 1: No take, only throw.

263
00:13:20,476 --> 00:13:20,556
Speaker 1: Yeah.

264
00:13:20,576 --> 00:13:34,324
Speaker 0: One, the one thing that I did here at the, the meeting that, you know, cause a lot of the things they complained about were things I also complained about, but the MTA at least, you know, appeared to have actually known these things, right?

265
00:13:34,344 --> 00:13:35,957
Speaker 0: Like I was going to be like, ah, 21st street.

266
00:13:35,978 --> 00:13:38,413
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, we're working with the MTA on 21st street.

267
00:13:38,433 --> 00:13:42,173
Speaker 0: They had already preemptively thought they were like, you know, accessibility.

268
00:13:42,233 --> 00:13:45,267
Speaker 0: Everyone was like, eh, you know, I can't get around.

269
00:13:45,308 --> 00:13:46,252
Speaker 0: I'm an old person.

270
00:13:46,293 --> 00:13:48,343
Speaker 0: There's no elevators at the subway.

271
00:13:48,665 --> 00:13:52,285
Speaker 0: Even if I can get on the subway at Astoria Boulevard, let me finish the elevator.

272
00:13:52,527 --> 00:13:53,775
Speaker 0: Where the hell can I get off?

273
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:54,218
Speaker 0: Right.

274
00:13:54,238 --> 00:13:55,566
Speaker 0: There's no elevator where I'm going.

275
00:13:55,607 --> 00:13:55,868
Speaker 0: Yup.

276
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,291
Speaker 0: Right.

277
00:13:56,472 --> 00:14:03,676
Speaker 1: The terrifying and sad thing about the New York city subway is a disability activist a while ago made this great map that showed the map of the New York city subway.

278
00:14:03,997 --> 00:14:05,042
Speaker 1: If you're in a wheelchair.

279
00:14:05,082 --> 00:14:05,283
Speaker 0: Right.

280
00:14:05,605 --> 00:14:15,129
Speaker 1: And on one hand, it's way sparser than the full subway, but on the other hand, that map by itself is a better mass transit system than any other city in America.

281
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:15,431
Speaker 0: Yeah.

282
00:14:15,491 --> 00:14:16,336
Speaker 0: It's still garbage though.

283
00:14:16,376 --> 00:14:16,577
Speaker 0: Yeah.

284
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,092
Speaker 0: Uh, but the point is some billions from upstate.

285
00:14:19,294 --> 00:14:26,792
Speaker 0: One thing, a lot of people complained about that the MTA did not take into consideration and didn't have like a, they didn't have like a response to that.

286
00:14:27,576 --> 00:14:33,021
Speaker 0: Like all the people like accessibility, they were like, yeah, we knew you were going to say that 21st street.

287
00:14:33,061 --> 00:14:34,330
Speaker 0: We knew you were going to say that, right?

288
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:48,215
Speaker 0: When people, the thing that they messed up was that New York city buses, a lot of kids use that to go to school and there's a lot of bus stops around schools and there's a lot of, you know, and kids will often get on a bus, right?

289
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:49,922
Speaker 0: Take the bus and get off at school.

290
00:14:50,203 --> 00:14:50,464
Speaker 0: Right.

291
00:14:50,946 --> 00:14:51,790
Speaker 0: And that's how they do.

292
00:14:52,713 --> 00:14:59,300
Speaker 0: And by changing the buses to be less and more straight kids are going to have to make transfers.

293
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:03,359
Speaker 0: They don't know how to make or the bus stop won't be right next to the school.

294
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,153
Speaker 0: And a kid might have to walk like two blocks to get to the school.

295
00:15:06,173 --> 00:15:14,881
Speaker 0: And that might not be a problem for like high school or middle school even, but elementary school, but it's a problem for, you know, it's definitely a problem.

296
00:15:14,922 --> 00:15:15,062
Speaker 0: Right.

297
00:15:15,082 --> 00:15:25,963
Speaker 0: And I think a lot of the bus routes originally, or a lot of the school placements originally, that is why we're done, you know, in concert.

298
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:34,592
Speaker 1: And now they, you know, well, this gets back to a broader point where a lot of people who don't know anything about mass transit try to argue that buses are more flexible than trains.

299
00:15:34,894 --> 00:15:42,971
Speaker 1: And that's bullshit because the real argument would be trains by the nature of their inflexibility guarantee access to a route.

300
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,497
Speaker 1: It's hard to move a train line.

301
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:49,576
Speaker 1: So you naturally build infrastructure around the paths of rail.

302
00:15:49,897 --> 00:15:55,025
Speaker 1: Whereas a bus route, if you build infrastructure on a bus route, if it changes, all your infrastructure is now fucked.

303
00:15:56,692 --> 00:16:01,059
Speaker 0: But yeah, they didn't seem to realize that on Vernon Boulevard, there's all these buildings under construction.

304
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:03,153
Speaker 0: They're like, "No one uses the Vernon Boulevard bus.

305
00:16:03,193 --> 00:16:03,475
Speaker 0: It's gone

306
00:16:03,515 --> 00:16:04,099
Speaker 0: bye-bye.".

307
00:16:04,119 --> 00:16:05,768
Speaker 0: And everyone's like, "No.

308
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:07,779
Speaker 0: How are we going to get to the ferry?

309
00:16:07,819 --> 00:16:08,947
Speaker 0: How are we going to get to the park?

310
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:10,359
Speaker 0: How are we going to get to any of the water

311
00:16:10,399 --> 00:16:10,500
Speaker 0: stuff?".

312
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,301
Speaker 1: Also, there's going to be an infinite number of apartments there before too long.

313
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:15,313
Speaker 0: It's like three giant apartment buildings.

314
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,004
Speaker 0: One's done, but no one lives in it yet.

315
00:16:17,065 --> 00:16:18,314
Speaker 0: And two are under construction.

316
00:16:18,656 --> 00:16:20,954
Speaker 0: You're going to need something over there because those people, right?

317
00:16:21,136 --> 00:16:22,162
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we need over there.

318
00:16:22,364 --> 00:16:26,847
Speaker 1: We need a new subway line that goes through all of Australia and Queens and down into Brooklyn.

319
00:16:26,887 --> 00:16:33,635
Speaker 0: Well, instead they're building, they're trying to build a somewhat corrupt light rail.

320
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:35,200
Speaker 0: that's not the subway.

321
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:42,835
Speaker 1: I would be okay with a bunch of trams and light rails in the city if they were also building a bunch more full subways.

322
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:43,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

323
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:45,506
Speaker 1: Anyway, this isn't the New York City Transit Show.

324
00:16:46,007 --> 00:16:47,694
Speaker 0: So, the news.

325
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:50,707
Speaker 1: So, "Ride Your Waves" is in theaters in the US.

326
00:16:50,787 --> 00:16:52,677
Speaker 0: Well, it's going to be in theaters on one day.

327
00:16:53,641 --> 00:16:57,258
Speaker 0: So, it's a new movie directed by Masaaki Yuasa, new anime.

328
00:16:57,339 --> 00:16:58,022
Speaker 0: I guess it's not new.

329
00:16:58,063 --> 00:16:58,928
Speaker 0: It's been out for a while.

330
00:16:59,552 --> 00:17:01,121
Speaker 1: We mentioned it on the last Geek Nights.

331
00:17:01,202 --> 00:17:02,146
Speaker 0: It came out in Japan.

332
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:02,468
Speaker 0: when?

333
00:17:02,488 --> 00:17:03,975
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

334
00:17:04,377 --> 00:17:05,119
Speaker 0: Maybe sometime.

335
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,163
Speaker 0: 2019.

336
00:17:06,163 --> 00:17:06,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

337
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:07,209
Speaker 1: June.

338
00:17:07,269 --> 00:17:08,115
Speaker 1: June 2019.

339
00:17:08,115 --> 00:17:08,415
Speaker 0: Right.

340
00:17:08,436 --> 00:17:16,771
Speaker 0: So, now it's going to be in English in the US in the theaters with subtitles on February 19th and only February 19th.

341
00:17:16,832 --> 00:17:19,864
Speaker 0: Now, Masaaki Yuasa has never steered me wrong.

342
00:17:19,964 --> 00:17:20,146
Speaker 1: Nope.

343
00:17:20,387 --> 00:17:26,836
Speaker 0: Everything Masaaki Yuasa has touched with their directorial hand has been gold or gold adjacent.

344
00:17:26,876 --> 00:17:29,268
Speaker 1: But "Walk on Girl" I think is my favorite?

345
00:17:29,449 --> 00:17:30,093
Speaker 0: Yep, maybe.

346
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:31,722
Speaker 0: But I haven't finished watching "Tatami

347
00:17:31,742 --> 00:17:32,204
Speaker 0: Galaxy."

348
00:17:32,445 --> 00:17:32,727
Speaker 0: Yeah.

349
00:17:33,129 --> 00:17:34,877
Speaker 0: Which is "Walk on Girl" adjacent.

350
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:36,023
Speaker 1: "Walk on Girl" long form.

351
00:17:36,164 --> 00:17:36,365
Speaker 0: Yeah.

352
00:17:36,425 --> 00:17:37,651
Speaker 1: Or "Walk on Girl the

353
00:17:37,692 --> 00:17:38,375
Speaker 1: Wanderers."

354
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:38,757
Speaker 1: Right.

355
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,084
Speaker 1: There's an anime reference.

356
00:17:40,124 --> 00:17:41,411
Speaker 1: None of you are old enough to remember.

357
00:17:42,134 --> 00:17:44,993
Speaker 0: "Ride Your Wave," based on what I can tell about it.

358
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:45,940
Speaker 0: I didn't actually watch the trailer.

359
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:46,723
Speaker 0: Perhaps I should.

360
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:50,599
Speaker 0: Appears to be the most boring Masaaki Yuasa.

361
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,634
Speaker 0: It's just like a romantic comedy about a girl and a guy.

362
00:17:54,654 --> 00:17:55,517
Speaker 0: It's very hetero.

363
00:17:55,939 --> 00:17:57,689
Speaker 0: And the dude dies and he's a ghost.

364
00:17:57,931 --> 00:17:58,152
Speaker 0: Yep.

365
00:17:58,293 --> 00:17:59,199
Speaker 0: And it reminds me a lot of-.

366
00:17:59,219 --> 00:18:04,261
Speaker 1: Well, like I said, it's transformation, water as metaphor for transformation and/or death.

367
00:18:04,442 --> 00:18:10,573
Speaker 0: It reminds me of, you know, the famous ghost movie with Whoopi Goldberg and what's-his-face with the pottery.

368
00:18:10,734 --> 00:18:13,328
Speaker 1: Also the other recent Yuasa movie with the mermaid.

369
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:14,675
Speaker 0: Right, but less silly.

370
00:18:14,956 --> 00:18:18,175
Speaker 1: But that one also was water as metaphor for transformation and death.

371
00:18:18,356 --> 00:18:24,626
Speaker 1: When she turns, all the animals in the kill shelter into mermaids, like, pretty on the bottlenose there.

372
00:18:24,646 --> 00:18:26,658
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know, Japan's an island, right?

373
00:18:26,719 --> 00:18:27,201
Speaker 0: They like water.

374
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:33,710
Speaker 1: But also, you live, like, if you live in America, just watch every anime movie that comes out in a theater.

375
00:18:33,771 --> 00:18:35,782
Speaker 1: that is not a sequel to another anime series.

376
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:43,080
Speaker 0: So I mean, you know, I have less expectations for this than I do for other things with Yuasa's name on it, but I can go see it anyway.

377
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:43,381
Speaker 0: Yeah.

378
00:18:43,401 --> 00:18:44,688
Speaker 1: He hasn't steered me wrong.

379
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,021
Speaker 0: And also, damn, that dude is prolific, right?

380
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,872
Speaker 0: You look at, like, say Hosoda, right?

381
00:18:49,093 --> 00:18:54,112
Speaker 0: Hosoda has been coming out with a new anime pretty much every three years.

382
00:18:54,574 --> 00:18:55,136
Speaker 0: Exactly.

383
00:18:55,597 --> 00:19:01,217
Speaker 0: Like, Summer Wars, one, two, three, Wolf and Boy, whatever that was called.

384
00:19:01,899 --> 00:19:03,107
Speaker 0: What was the one with the wolf and the kid?

385
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,739
Speaker 1: Oh, God, I forgot the title.

386
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,362
Speaker 1: We reviewed it.

387
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:06,206
Speaker 1: I saw it.

388
00:19:06,508 --> 00:19:07,372
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

389
00:19:07,412 --> 00:19:11,852
Speaker 0: And then one, two, three, and then the one with the architect house that we just saw.

390
00:19:12,073 --> 00:19:12,294
Speaker 0: Yeah.

391
00:19:12,314 --> 00:19:12,796
Speaker 1: Right.

392
00:19:12,836 --> 00:19:14,024
Speaker 1: I like that one.

393
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:15,014
Speaker 0: I do like that one a lot.

394
00:19:15,034 --> 00:19:15,519
Speaker 0: I forget the name.

395
00:19:16,561 --> 00:19:16,863
Speaker 0: I knew it.

396
00:19:17,266 --> 00:19:19,478
Speaker 0: I saw it the other day, the name of it, and I forgot.

397
00:19:19,518 --> 00:19:19,720
Speaker 0: All right.

398
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:22,762
Speaker 0: Mirai.

399
00:19:23,284 --> 00:19:24,328
Speaker 1: Yes, Mirai.

400
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:24,810
Speaker 1: Mirai.

401
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:27,703
Speaker 0: And then I'm sure three years after Mirai was, what, last year?

402
00:19:27,723 --> 00:19:29,009
Speaker 0: It's already one.

403
00:19:29,029 --> 00:19:29,853
Speaker 1: Was it two years ago?

404
00:19:29,873 --> 00:19:31,280
Speaker 1: I lose track.

405
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:34,782
Speaker 0: I feel like next year or the year after is going to be another Hosoda movie.

406
00:19:34,822 --> 00:19:36,613
Speaker 0: The point is, that's every three years.

407
00:19:36,653 --> 00:19:41,896
Speaker 0: Hosoda is putting out a movie, like, several per year, like two per year.

408
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:45,793
Speaker 0: He's just cranking him out, like, damn, are you sure you're not?

409
00:19:46,235 --> 00:19:48,908
Speaker 0: I'm worried about overworked animators going on over there.

410
00:19:49,029 --> 00:19:51,944
Speaker 1: I haven't heard any bad stuff about those two years.

411
00:19:52,064 --> 00:19:53,471
Speaker 0: No, they're putting out good work.

412
00:19:53,812 --> 00:19:58,313
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's a lot of quantity over there to be having the quality.

413
00:19:58,816 --> 00:19:59,720
Speaker 1: So some other news.

414
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:03,516
Speaker 1: This is like weirdly big news in the anime world.

415
00:20:03,576 --> 00:20:07,050
Speaker 0: It's big news in the US anime fan.

416
00:20:07,130 --> 00:20:07,712
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

417
00:20:08,033 --> 00:20:17,468
Speaker 0: In the scene of people who go to anime cons in the US and the scene of people who tweet about anime in the US or make YouTube videos about anime in the US.

418
00:20:17,488 --> 00:20:18,132
Speaker 1: Yeah, there you go.

419
00:20:18,493 --> 00:20:27,303
Speaker 1: This is big news among the subset of mostly white dudes who review anime on YouTube and like titty anime.

420
00:20:27,825 --> 00:20:33,244
Speaker 1: That demographic is really butter about this and no one else cares.

421
00:20:33,586 --> 00:20:39,155
Speaker 1: But good lord, if they saturated Anna Twitter and like every forum talking about this fucking show.

422
00:20:39,697 --> 00:20:41,847
Speaker 1: So basically what happened, I'm going to super summarize.

423
00:20:42,229 --> 00:20:47,192
Speaker 1: There is this garbage porn manga called Interspecies Reviewers.

424
00:20:47,232 --> 00:20:53,181
Speaker 0: Now, I'm not saying that you can guess from the title exactly what the fuck it's about and you would be exactly right.

425
00:20:53,242 --> 00:20:54,025
Speaker 1: Well, yeah.

426
00:20:54,065 --> 00:20:57,682
Speaker 1: So there's been a lot of Monster Girl type anime content lately.

427
00:20:57,823 --> 00:20:58,084
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

428
00:20:58,245 --> 00:20:59,753
Speaker 1: Of varying levels of quality.

429
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:06,085
Speaker 0: But this is literally like they go around fucking different species and they review how good each species is at fucking.

430
00:21:06,105 --> 00:21:08,717
Speaker 1: You go around and fuck like the cat girl.

431
00:21:08,918 --> 00:21:09,260
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

432
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:10,764
Speaker 0: Lamia is great.

433
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:13,573
Speaker 1: You know, here's the thing.

434
00:21:13,653 --> 00:21:19,558
Speaker 1: So this show, like all those other Monster Girl shows, like the one you're all thinking of monster.

435
00:21:19,699 --> 00:21:21,109
Speaker 1: God, I don't know the names, any of these shows.

436
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:23,263
Speaker 1: The one with the Lamia, like the red Lamia girl.

437
00:21:23,304 --> 00:21:24,551
Speaker 1: That's like the one everyone knows.

438
00:21:25,114 --> 00:21:26,783
Speaker 1: That's the first one that kind of made it big.

439
00:21:27,206 --> 00:21:28,815
Speaker 1: They're at least like like a centaur.

440
00:21:28,835 --> 00:21:31,449
Speaker 1: Like they're actually like monster girls and there's something going on.

441
00:21:31,489 --> 00:21:34,142
Speaker 1: It's more like a edgy comedy type show.

442
00:21:34,704 --> 00:21:36,590
Speaker 1: This is just porn.

443
00:21:36,971 --> 00:21:37,212
Speaker 1: OK.

444
00:21:37,653 --> 00:21:38,817
Speaker 0: And it's not hentai.

445
00:21:38,917 --> 00:21:40,563
Speaker 1: It's not kind of is just hentai.

446
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:46,269
Speaker 0: I heard that it was basically like on the border line where it's not actually like it's on the border.

447
00:21:46,289 --> 00:21:46,389
Speaker 1: It is.

448
00:21:46,891 --> 00:21:48,116
Speaker 1: It is the border, right?

449
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:53,278
Speaker 0: It is a razor's edge, but it's not just like completely explicit.

450
00:21:53,338 --> 00:21:55,165
Speaker 0: We're showing everything right.

451
00:21:55,205 --> 00:22:01,748
Speaker 1: This is way past Elvin Bride, like that level of like hentai comedy into.

452
00:22:01,768 --> 00:22:04,357
Speaker 1: But here's the other thing.

453
00:22:04,377 --> 00:22:08,240
Speaker 1: I read a bunch of reviews about it to see what the deal was, because apparently it's not even good.

454
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:12,517
Speaker 1: Like no one who knows anything thinks this show is good.

455
00:22:12,557 --> 00:22:18,706
Speaker 1: All the reviews say it's kind of a garbage, low effort show with ridiculous, like big titty to anime girl nonsense.

456
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:20,657
Speaker 1: Like there is no reason to consume this.

457
00:22:20,698 --> 00:22:24,712
Speaker 1: There is no value to the show, even if you're an anime titty type of person.

458
00:22:25,675 --> 00:22:30,798
Speaker 0: But like, I'm sure like, you know, it's on the one hand, right?

459
00:22:30,879 --> 00:22:34,999
Speaker 1: It's like, imagine anime titties the side, like double the size of basketball.

460
00:22:35,039 --> 00:22:37,191
Speaker 1: Like it's that level of absurd crap.

461
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,820
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's a. it's not a good show.

462
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,643
Speaker 0: So if you if someone comes and says this is a good show that I cannot respect.

463
00:22:42,723 --> 00:22:42,944
Speaker 0: Right.

464
00:22:43,185 --> 00:22:46,522
Speaker 0: But if someone is just like, yeah, it's bad, but that's my fetish.

465
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,230
Speaker 0: I'm like, all right, you do you, bro.

466
00:22:48,592 --> 00:22:49,034
Speaker 0: Right.

467
00:22:49,054 --> 00:22:57,792
Speaker 0: But at the same time, if that is your fetish, wouldn't there be better things that are the same like, look, they're way better hentai.

468
00:22:57,812 --> 00:23:02,050
Speaker 0: Like if you're in there a way better monster girl show, you're into monster girls.

469
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:08,376
Speaker 0: Aren't there hotter, better monster girl things to fat to than this one, right?

470
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,425
Speaker 0: This can't be the best monster girl thing.

471
00:23:11,129 --> 00:23:13,279
Speaker 1: There is a lot of monster girl counts, right?

472
00:23:13,299 --> 00:23:14,325
Speaker 1: There has to be a Sumi.

473
00:23:14,345 --> 00:23:15,815
Speaker 1: That's the one that everyone knows, right?

474
00:23:15,835 --> 00:23:18,209
Speaker 0: There has to be a better one to fat to than this one.

475
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:19,053
Speaker 1: Yeah.

476
00:23:19,094 --> 00:23:19,576
Speaker 1: That one.

477
00:23:19,636 --> 00:23:20,461
Speaker 1: That's the one everyone knows.

478
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:20,742
Speaker 0: Anyway.

479
00:23:20,762 --> 00:23:22,672
Speaker 0: So what happened with this perverted show?

480
00:23:22,934 --> 00:23:27,354
Speaker 0: So funimation pick this show up and not know what it was.

481
00:23:27,374 --> 00:23:27,916
Speaker 1: I don't know.

482
00:23:27,977 --> 00:23:29,745
Speaker 1: They picked it up and they started dubbing it.

483
00:23:30,027 --> 00:23:31,052
Speaker 0: I heard.

484
00:23:31,152 --> 00:23:32,580
Speaker 0: I heard that they were going to dub it.

485
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,995
Speaker 0: And I'm like, man, you got to know what the show is.

486
00:23:34,055 --> 00:23:36,027
Speaker 0: If you're going to invest in dubbing and not just oven.

487
00:23:36,368 --> 00:23:36,629
Speaker 0: Yeah.

488
00:23:36,951 --> 00:23:45,474
Speaker 1: So, uh, they got a couple episodes in and then they immediately announced that they were going to cease dubbing it and it's not coming out anymore.

489
00:23:45,776 --> 00:23:49,174
Speaker 1: And they issued a very simple statement quote after careful consideration.

490
00:23:49,455 --> 00:23:51,970
Speaker 1: We determined that this series falls outside of our standards.

491
00:23:52,252 --> 00:23:53,942
Speaker 1: We have the utmost respect for our creators.

492
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:59,672
Speaker 1: So rather than substantially altering the content, we felt it, we felt taking it down was the more respectful choice.

493
00:23:59,994 --> 00:24:05,342
Speaker 0: Maybe that they, maybe what happened is they knew, okay, this is going to be one of those kinds of shows.

494
00:24:05,382 --> 00:24:17,599
Speaker 0: And they had done shows like that before, but then when they were actually started working on it, you know, it's like episode one, episode two, and then like they watch, they were doing it as it came out.

495
00:24:18,022 --> 00:24:22,445
Speaker 0: And then once they actually saw episode three, they were like, Oh, this goes over the line for us.

496
00:24:22,546 --> 00:24:22,767
Speaker 0: Yep.

497
00:24:22,887 --> 00:24:27,409
Speaker 0: Or maybe we thought it was just the regular old normal, you know, edgy kind of stuff.

498
00:24:27,711 --> 00:24:29,519
Speaker 0: This is going to this go too far.

499
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:31,427
Speaker 0: We're going to stop doing this now.

500
00:24:31,527 --> 00:24:31,648
Speaker 0: So

501
00:24:31,728 --> 00:24:48,846
Speaker 1: I see a lot of angry weebs who are all in the demographic we described before, which is an almost perfect overlap with the demographic of people at anime cons who wear that stupid Ahego shirt, uh, which is a giant sign that says, uh, please avoid me under all circumstances.

502
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:58,728
Speaker 1: But what they're mad about is that this is funimation, like trying to police sexuality and police started doing the show in the first place.

503
00:24:58,788 --> 00:24:59,755
Speaker 0: Would you be saying that?

504
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:02,148
Speaker 1: And then they're like, but what about Penny and stocking?

505
00:25:02,188 --> 00:25:03,596
Speaker 1: Was that over the line?

506
00:25:03,757 --> 00:25:06,252
Speaker 0: Like they don't any inside needs even close to this show.

507
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:15,334
Speaker 1: Like they don't like the people who are mad about this have no sense of context or nuance or the idea or something can be close to the line and not over it.

508
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:17,526
Speaker 0: Something can be close to the line and over it.

509
00:25:17,607 --> 00:25:19,276
Speaker 1: This is a trend I see generally in.

510
00:25:19,317 --> 00:25:25,405
Speaker 1: like anime fandom in particular, but it is in other areas as a company, freedom of speech, whatever.

511
00:25:25,667 --> 00:25:30,703
Speaker 0: Like if someone who was, if the government was saying this show is banned from the U S then I'd be like, yeah, fuck your censorship.

512
00:25:30,743 --> 00:25:32,395
Speaker 0: But no, it's like, we're funimation.

513
00:25:32,415 --> 00:25:33,200
Speaker 0: We're a private company.

514
00:25:33,280 --> 00:25:35,111
Speaker 0: We can do whatever we want and we don't want to do this.

515
00:25:35,312 --> 00:25:37,265
Speaker 0: So, but they don't want to do it.

516
00:25:37,285 --> 00:25:37,991
Speaker 1: They don't have to do it.

517
00:25:38,052 --> 00:25:38,980
Speaker 1: It's like that wint tweet.

518
00:25:39,061 --> 00:25:41,338
Speaker 1: Like there's no difference between good things and bad things.

519
00:25:41,358 --> 00:25:47,143
Speaker 1: Like these are people who like cannot understand that two different situations are in different.

520
00:25:48,308 --> 00:25:52,745
Speaker 1: So somehow this is like the biggest news in the anime community and TLDR.

521
00:25:53,107 --> 00:25:56,785
Speaker 1: it's a crappy show that was way more pointy than the funimation expected.

522
00:25:57,268 --> 00:25:58,012
Speaker 1: So they dropped it.

523
00:25:58,273 --> 00:25:58,373
Speaker 0: Yeah.

524
00:25:58,393 --> 00:26:00,242
Speaker 0: I mean, if you want to fat to it though, go ahead.

525
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:04,742
Speaker 0: It's not, it's not my bag, but I'm sure you could find a better bag.

526
00:26:04,762 --> 00:26:05,965
Speaker 0: That's the same colored bag.

527
00:26:06,286 --> 00:26:06,687
Speaker 1: Yeah.

528
00:26:07,188 --> 00:26:09,314
Speaker 1: Like good Lord.

529
00:26:09,575 --> 00:26:18,022
Speaker 0: But the, the, the, also videos about it, if you want to fat to it, do you really need a dub or sub?

530
00:26:18,665 --> 00:26:18,926
Speaker 1: Yeah.

531
00:26:18,987 --> 00:26:19,710
Speaker 1: Like, well, yes.

532
00:26:20,273 --> 00:26:21,800
Speaker 1: I feel like you just need an animated gif.

533
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,345
Speaker 0: I feel like you can just watch it raw, baby.

534
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:26,175
Speaker 0: I like it wrong.

535
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:38,817
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's time for things of the day.

536
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:44,680
Speaker 1: So, uh, many of you, if you don't know, uh, Sarah Anderson, you've probably seen Sarah Anderson comics.

537
00:26:44,801 --> 00:26:48,862
Speaker 0: You see a Sarah Anderson comic and then some, and you'd be like, oh, I've seen those.

538
00:26:49,446 --> 00:26:56,468
Speaker 0: And then, well, now, you know, that's a comic by Sarah Anderson and you can search for Sarah Anderson and find Sarah Anderson things that are adjacent to that.

539
00:26:56,629 --> 00:26:58,820
Speaker 1: So Sarah Anderson's got a new ish comic.

540
00:26:58,981 --> 00:27:03,524
Speaker 1: Like it's pretty new and it's drawn in a very different style and it's utterly adorable.

541
00:27:03,625 --> 00:27:07,343
Speaker 1: And weirdly enough, it is actually kind of adjacent to my news.

542
00:27:07,624 --> 00:27:13,361
Speaker 0: Today's geek nights brought to you by the word monster girl orthogonal.

543
00:27:14,085 --> 00:27:23,709
Speaker 1: It's called fangs and it's a serial and the comic is like a four comedy kind of thing, but it's about this vampire girl who starts dating a werewolf dude.

544
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:24,533
Speaker 0: That's pretty normal.

545
00:27:24,735 --> 00:27:26,283
Speaker 1: And like, she's just like, she's a vampire.

546
00:27:26,324 --> 00:27:28,798
Speaker 1: Like she just kills people and he's a werewolf.

547
00:27:28,838 --> 00:27:29,843
Speaker 0: Vampires do bro.

548
00:27:30,184 --> 00:27:32,776
Speaker 1: And this comic is adorable and delightful.

549
00:27:32,896 --> 00:27:34,041
Speaker 1: And I recommend you all read it.

550
00:27:34,383 --> 00:27:34,664
Speaker 1: Okay.

551
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:41,276
Speaker 1: So it's little comics like she's asleep because they were on a date and he wakes up and he's like, good morning.

552
00:27:41,297 --> 00:27:45,523
Speaker 1: And he opens the blinds and then she catches on fire and he closes the blinds like, oh no, I'm so sorry.

553
00:27:47,109 --> 00:27:48,956
Speaker 1: Or she starts telling the story like, yeah.

554
00:27:48,996 --> 00:27:55,380
Speaker 1: So I was like eating this dude once and I bit him through the artery and the blood whenever it was like dragged him into the tub and there's blood everywhere.

555
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:59,159
Speaker 1: And as he was like the tub and as he was bleeding out, I laughed.

556
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:03,823
Speaker 1: And I just told, I told him before he faded out, like, Hey, this sure turned into a blood bath.

557
00:28:03,863 --> 00:28:05,047
Speaker 1: And he's just like fist bump.

558
00:28:06,955 --> 00:28:07,738
Speaker 1: It's just really cute.

559
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:08,120
Speaker 1: Okay.

560
00:28:09,343 --> 00:28:13,060
Speaker 0: So, uh, there was a movie that came out live action movie called parasite.

561
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:13,964
Speaker 0: You may have heard of it.

562
00:28:13,985 --> 00:28:15,694
Speaker 0: Uh, it's a pretty big deal.

563
00:28:16,036 --> 00:28:16,720
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it yet.

564
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,808
Speaker 1: I plan to it's Korean movie.

565
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:20,775
Speaker 0: It is a great movie.

566
00:28:21,056 --> 00:28:22,100
Speaker 0: I pointedly avoided.

567
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:25,644
Speaker 1: Like I literally don't know what it's about and I'm avoiding it's about capitalism.

568
00:28:25,784 --> 00:28:26,508
Speaker 0: Yeah.

569
00:28:26,568 --> 00:28:28,478
Speaker 1: I've heard that and that's all I need to say.

570
00:28:28,518 --> 00:28:29,343
Speaker 0: I spoiled the whole movie.

571
00:28:29,383 --> 00:28:31,598
Speaker 1: I don't want to know anything else about it until I see it.

572
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:33,687
Speaker 0: There's nothing else to know.

573
00:28:33,707 --> 00:28:35,337
Speaker 1: I mean, I went into walk on girl.

574
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:39,415
Speaker 1: the night is long, not even knowing like what it was about, whatever.

575
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:42,066
Speaker 0: Uh, I don't think spoilers can ruin parasites.

576
00:28:42,106 --> 00:28:42,508
Speaker 0: Greatness.

577
00:28:42,608 --> 00:28:45,843
Speaker 0: The point is, uh, if you haven't seen it, go see it.

578
00:28:46,064 --> 00:28:54,075
Speaker 0: Unlike rim who hasn't, I plan to, but the director, uh, and also the, uh, actor of the main ish character, right.

579
00:28:54,557 --> 00:28:58,375
Speaker 0: Uh, are here in this YouTube video on what vanity fairs, YouTube channel.

580
00:28:58,757 --> 00:28:58,998
Speaker 0: Right.

581
00:28:59,079 --> 00:29:03,015
Speaker 0: And what they're doing is they're breaking down in great detail.

582
00:29:03,035 --> 00:29:05,144
Speaker 0: Uh, the first scene of the movie.

583
00:29:05,405 --> 00:29:06,450
Speaker 1: Ooh, I love this like that.

584
00:29:07,033 --> 00:29:08,902
Speaker 0: And they really break it down.

585
00:29:09,184 --> 00:29:12,279
Speaker 0: It is quite fascinating, you know, on many levels, right?

586
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,697
Speaker 0: They're talking about the metaphor of the things that are happening.

587
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:17,734
Speaker 0: They talk about the actual like making of like, Oh yeah.

588
00:29:17,754 --> 00:29:19,262
Speaker 0: And this scene, this was all real.

589
00:29:19,362 --> 00:29:23,159
Speaker 0: And the stuff back there was made by graphic like VFX, right?

590
00:29:23,199 --> 00:29:27,599
Speaker 0: You know, the soundstage ends about here and this is where the CG starts, right?

591
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:28,968
Speaker 1: I love videos like that.

592
00:29:28,988 --> 00:29:31,928
Speaker 0: You're getting all these different details from all these different angles, right?

593
00:29:31,968 --> 00:29:55,208
Speaker 0: The stories of the experience of, you know, how it was filming the scene or talking about the other actors and all this kind of, so, uh, if you've seen the movie, you can come and watch this and also go around YouTube and other places looking for other, you know, because this isn't the, you know, usually a lot of times the commentary on DVDs or extras or whatever it is these days, wherever you get extras these days and the days of digital

594
00:29:55,228 --> 00:29:59,187
Speaker 1: always think back to eco horror is commentary on the your tenant movie.

595
00:29:59,207 --> 00:30:03,266
Speaker 0: They vary wildly in quality and content, right?

596
00:30:03,366 --> 00:30:07,145
Speaker 0: But here, this is my favorite kind because I don't like the commentary.

597
00:30:07,165 --> 00:30:08,496
Speaker 0: We have to watch the whole thing again.

598
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:09,644
Speaker 0: And they're talking the whole time.

599
00:30:10,026 --> 00:30:11,475
Speaker 0: This is like, you know, brief.

600
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:12,662
Speaker 0: It's like, how long is this video?

601
00:30:12,883 --> 00:30:14,513
Speaker 0: Five minutes, 10 minutes, 13 minutes, 13 minutes.

602
00:30:14,653 --> 00:30:17,880
Speaker 1: Remember way back where you're watching all the commentaries for like old South parks.

603
00:30:18,202 --> 00:30:20,176
Speaker 1: And they only go for like five minutes in the beginning.

604
00:30:20,216 --> 00:30:22,069
Speaker 1: And then they just, there's no more commentary, right?

605
00:30:22,150 --> 00:30:27,344
Speaker 0: It's like, that's what I like is, you know, I don't want to have to rewatch the whole thing with the running commentary the whole time.

606
00:30:27,384 --> 00:30:30,598
Speaker 1: The commentary is dense and good the entire time.

607
00:30:30,618 --> 00:30:32,085
Speaker 0: It's really hard to do, right?

608
00:30:32,286 --> 00:30:36,123
Speaker 0: But by, you know, just a short commentary, that's really fascinating.

609
00:30:36,183 --> 00:30:44,325
Speaker 0: It can satisfy my need for meta about the thing, uh, without having, you know, if I want to watch the movie again, I'll just watch it again and learn on my own.

610
00:30:44,345 --> 00:30:44,606
Speaker 0: Right.

611
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:48,507
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, the book club book is still the tale of Genji.

612
00:30:48,688 --> 00:30:49,614
Speaker 1: I am reading through it.

613
00:30:49,634 --> 00:30:51,122
Speaker 1: I am learning about Genji.

614
00:30:51,564 --> 00:30:55,558
Speaker 1: Everyone is cooler than Genji, even though it's Genji's tail.

615
00:30:55,759 --> 00:30:56,040
Speaker 1: Yeah.

616
00:30:56,361 --> 00:31:01,980
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, it's just sort of like what happens about Frodo or Bilbo.

617
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:04,689
Speaker 0: I mean, it's increasingly cooler.

618
00:31:04,889 --> 00:31:12,438
Speaker 1: It's more like what happens or like due to the circumstances of Genji's birth and life, what happens around Genji?

619
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,106
Speaker 1: Like Genji's Genji's.

620
00:31:14,146 --> 00:31:15,112
Speaker 1: It's almost like 10 G Muyo.

621
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:22,629
Speaker 1: Like no one gives a about 10 G that care about everything, but 10 G I'm getting that same vibe from the tail of Genji that I'm supposed to care about.

622
00:31:23,011 --> 00:31:24,357
Speaker 1: Literally everyone else.

623
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:27,788
Speaker 0: Genji Muyo, Genji Muyo.

624
00:31:28,529 --> 00:31:29,552
Speaker 1: No need for Genji.

625
00:31:30,655 --> 00:31:31,658
Speaker 0: Genji in Tokyo.

626
00:31:31,718 --> 00:31:32,962
Speaker 1: Has anyone made that joke?

627
00:31:33,665 --> 00:31:34,590
Speaker 1: I got to, we'll see.

628
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:36,319
Speaker 1: Well, we'll talk about this at some point.

629
00:31:36,359 --> 00:31:44,522
Speaker 1: We'll, we'll pick a stopping point and talk about how, what we've read up to that point and do like, this'll take probably four or five geek nights book club shows.

630
00:31:44,703 --> 00:31:45,044
Speaker 1: Who knows?

631
00:31:45,587 --> 00:31:46,772
Speaker 1: Uh, I'm enjoying it.

632
00:31:47,013 --> 00:31:48,519
Speaker 0: It's just, yeah, it's a thing.

633
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,393
Speaker 0: It's the first novel ever in the history of humanity.

634
00:31:52,454 --> 00:31:53,799
Speaker 0: The first novel.

635
00:31:53,839 --> 00:32:02,038
Speaker 0: It's not the first fiction, obviously, is the first fiction in the form of a book that could be called a novel and not say an epic poem or something like that.

636
00:32:02,439 --> 00:32:14,434
Speaker 1: Our brand new panel from PAX South 2020, the 41 tabletop games you should play is just on YouTube and we will be live at PAX East, which is coming up with Take Your Fucking Turn, which we did at PAX Unplugged.

637
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:18,459
Speaker 0: So if you are going to PAX East, you don't have to waste your time coming to see us at PAX East.

638
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:20,911
Speaker 0: You can just watch this video on PAX Unplugged.

639
00:32:21,232 --> 00:32:26,177
Speaker 0: and at PAX East you can, instead of going to our panel, go to a different panel, play some games.

640
00:32:26,217 --> 00:32:33,316
Speaker 1: The differences between the YouTube video and we did this at PAX Unplugged and when we do it at PAX East, we'll be like, two slides will be tweaked.

641
00:32:33,558 --> 00:32:34,944
Speaker 1: We'll tell a couple different jokes.

642
00:32:35,005 --> 00:32:36,853
Speaker 0: We'll say the word Boston instead of Philly.

643
00:32:36,994 --> 00:32:37,255
Speaker 0: Yep.

644
00:32:37,778 --> 00:32:42,986
Speaker 1: We won't be as, we won't talk about how much we hate Boston as much as we talked about how much we hate Philly.

645
00:32:43,026 --> 00:32:43,912
Speaker 0: I don't hate Boston.

646
00:32:44,153 --> 00:32:46,263
Speaker 0: Get a different New Yorker if you want to hate Boston.

647
00:32:46,303 --> 00:32:46,543
Speaker 0: Yeah.

648
00:32:46,904 --> 00:32:48,829
Speaker 0: There's plenty to choose from.

649
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:53,342
Speaker 1: What did I, someone, I saw a Philly.

650
00:32:53,864 --> 00:32:54,807
Speaker 1: I don't hate Boston.

651
00:32:55,148 --> 00:32:58,320
Speaker 1: Boston is beneath my contempt, but I hate Philly.

652
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:02,501
Speaker 0: Like I'm not like a Boston fan, but I don't hate them like other New Yorkers do.

653
00:33:02,602 --> 00:33:05,717
Speaker 1: I mean, Boston is one of the few cities in America.

654
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:06,220
Speaker 0: They hate me.

655
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:06,722
Speaker 0: They hate us.

656
00:33:06,822 --> 00:33:07,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

657
00:33:07,204 --> 00:33:10,098
Speaker 1: But there's jealous, but they got some mass transit.

658
00:33:10,138 --> 00:33:14,315
Speaker 1: Like they actually have a semi-functional like subway train system.

659
00:33:14,395 --> 00:33:16,543
Speaker 1: Kind of more so than most places.

660
00:33:16,824 --> 00:33:17,828
Speaker 1: Way better than DC.

661
00:33:17,868 --> 00:33:18,350
Speaker 1: Good luck.

662
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:18,832
Speaker 1: Good Lord.

663
00:33:19,032 --> 00:33:19,333
Speaker 0: Kinda.

664
00:33:19,795 --> 00:33:20,156
Speaker 0: Kinda.

665
00:33:20,176 --> 00:33:20,257
Speaker 0: Yeah.

666
00:33:22,121 --> 00:33:23,966
Speaker 1: First, Philly's is actually not that bad.

667
00:33:23,986 --> 00:33:28,942
Speaker 1: Anyway, so anime movie weathering with you.

668
00:33:29,062 --> 00:33:31,375
Speaker 1: We saw it, we got, I saw it a while ago in the theater.

669
00:33:31,395 --> 00:33:31,616
Speaker 0: Right.

670
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:43,375
Speaker 0: So to review, Makoto Shinkai, this dude we found out about when we were in college, when we saw Hoshino Koi, the story that we learned was that this was some dude who made an anime, a very short anime in like his basement with his wife.

671
00:33:43,496 --> 00:33:45,886
Speaker 1: Voices of a distant star Hoshino Koi.

672
00:33:46,087 --> 00:33:46,268
Speaker 1: Right.

673
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:56,822
Speaker 0: And it was this, you know, very moving, very short tiered jerky and short animation about young lovers separated by space and time.

674
00:33:56,842 --> 00:33:58,247
Speaker 1: Yup.

675
00:33:58,327 --> 00:33:59,251
Speaker 1: To 2002, this came out.

676
00:33:59,291 --> 00:34:04,651
Speaker 1: We watched it like right after it came out and Makoto Shinkai 20 ish minutes long.

677
00:34:04,952 --> 00:34:07,846
Speaker 0: Makoto Shinkai went on to make a whole bunch of other things.

678
00:34:08,530 --> 00:34:09,858
Speaker 0: Uh, like five centimeters per second.

679
00:34:09,878 --> 00:34:10,703
Speaker 0: That was Shinkai, right?

680
00:34:10,764 --> 00:34:10,965
Speaker 0: Yeah.

681
00:34:11,246 --> 00:34:11,447
Speaker 0: Right.

682
00:34:11,971 --> 00:34:18,284
Speaker 1: Uh, well, he's promised in our early days, children who chase lost voices, which is terrible, which we saw at the New York Comic Con.

683
00:34:18,344 --> 00:34:18,847
Speaker 1: words.

684
00:34:19,208 --> 00:34:20,614
Speaker 1: I saw the garden of words.

685
00:34:20,795 --> 00:34:21,820
Speaker 0: I'd haven't seen a garden of words.

686
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:22,523
Speaker 0: I don't think either.

687
00:34:22,824 --> 00:34:24,050
Speaker 1: anime drama film.

688
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:24,371
Speaker 1: What?

689
00:34:24,793 --> 00:34:26,320
Speaker 1: He has a movie he made in 2013.

690
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,828
Speaker 1: I didn't fucking know about me either.

691
00:34:28,331 --> 00:34:39,721
Speaker 0: Uh, the point is Makoto Shinkai, while there's a lot of great things about Makoto Shinkai is not on the level of like, you know, the Satoshi Kans, the Miyazaki's where there's batting out hits.

692
00:34:40,103 --> 00:34:40,605
Speaker 0: Well, right.

693
00:34:40,626 --> 00:34:44,605
Speaker 1: Uh, well, so I would say voices of a distant star because it was his first one.

694
00:34:44,625 --> 00:34:45,309
Speaker 0: That's still a hit.

695
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:48,185
Speaker 0: It was a hit because I bet the CG's really dated, but I don't care.

696
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:50,638
Speaker 1: I've cried a lot at anime before.

697
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,695
Speaker 1: Like that one works every time, but voices of a distant star.

698
00:34:53,715 --> 00:34:54,620
Speaker 1: That's a cult 45 anime.

699
00:34:54,980 --> 00:35:00,005
Speaker 1: Like I edged into ugly crying and I get a little choked up if I think about that movie too much.

700
00:35:00,146 --> 00:35:02,157
Speaker 0: And it's only like five minutes long.

701
00:35:02,157 --> 00:35:02,720
Speaker 1: 25 minutes long.

702
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,046
Speaker 0: Oh, it's longer than I thought.

703
00:35:04,347 --> 00:35:14,249
Speaker 1: But it was also like it perfectly distilled the genre that I would describe as lovers separated by space and time with clouds in the background.

704
00:35:14,269 --> 00:35:15,095
Speaker 0: Well, they didn't have clouds.

705
00:35:15,116 --> 00:35:15,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, they did.

706
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,304
Speaker 1: Yeah, they did.

707
00:35:16,324 --> 00:35:18,318
Speaker 0: You don't remember when he was on earth, there were clouds.

708
00:35:18,379 --> 00:35:22,198
Speaker 1: No, also her, the background when she's in the ship is cloud coming down.

709
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:22,480
Speaker 1: Yeah.

710
00:35:22,881 --> 00:35:25,114
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is we should watch it again and cry.

711
00:35:25,255 --> 00:35:26,904
Speaker 0: Shinkai specialty, right?

712
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:33,090
Speaker 1: It's over separated the space and time and is the lover separate space and time storyline and the cloud.

713
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:37,004
Speaker 0: environmental, you know, not necessarily the animation.

714
00:35:37,044 --> 00:35:38,070
Speaker 0: It's not about the movement.

715
00:35:38,191 --> 00:35:41,528
Speaker 0: It's just about how it looks like even still, right?

716
00:35:41,548 --> 00:35:51,006
Speaker 0: They're like, you can see like TV commercials animated by Shinkai and it's just like the unbelievable sky that he draws or gets his team to draw.

717
00:35:51,027 --> 00:35:53,340
Speaker 1: You see two seconds of and you're like, that's Makoto Shinkai.

718
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:57,422
Speaker 0: It's like you can see a single cloud and be like, that's a Makoto Shinkai cloud.

719
00:35:57,462 --> 00:36:02,606
Speaker 0: The same way that it would be like, you know, uh, you know, that's a Itano circus.

720
00:36:02,626 --> 00:36:03,734
Speaker 0: Look at the way those missiles move.

721
00:36:03,774 --> 00:36:06,753
Speaker 0: I can just tell, I can tell right away that that mech was made by Itano.

722
00:36:06,874 --> 00:36:16,250
Speaker 0: I feel like someday we're going to talk about the Shinkai cloud or like the way that like Shinkai sky, the way to Miyazaki movie, the monster will be kind of like, we'll kind of move in that sort of blobby way.

723
00:36:16,330 --> 00:36:25,684
Speaker 1: Like the, you know, the board at the start of, but also in Miyazaki, the way when there's a machine, like a car or a plane, like that way, it sort of vibrates and throws the way like it's about to fall apart.

724
00:36:25,764 --> 00:36:35,492
Speaker 1: or the way a building collapses in a, in a, you know, or the way an hour will come up over a hill and come down while there's someone walking on the road next to anyway.

725
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:36,035
Speaker 0: Right.

726
00:36:36,115 --> 00:36:38,766
Speaker 0: But those are all things that happen animatedly, right?

727
00:36:38,847 --> 00:36:46,098
Speaker 0: Shinkai is just about, it captures the cloud in the sky, mostly the environment, the weather, and is still image.

728
00:36:46,118 --> 00:36:50,259
Speaker 0: So here in a lot of his previous movies, he went hard on the weather, right?

729
00:36:50,319 --> 00:36:51,929
Speaker 0: Your name was, and you know, eventually, right.

730
00:36:51,949 --> 00:36:56,375
Speaker 0: He got to your name, which is the biggest fucking deal in like anime history.

731
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,123
Speaker 1: I also think it is his greatest work.

732
00:36:58,283 --> 00:37:01,155
Speaker 1: Probably your name is a phenomenal movie, right?

733
00:37:02,179 --> 00:37:05,216
Speaker 0: Uh, it's not perfect, but it's, it's not perfect, but it is phenomenal.

734
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,082
Speaker 0: His greatest work.

735
00:37:06,243 --> 00:37:07,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I would call it a phenomenal movie.

736
00:37:07,755 --> 00:37:08,601
Speaker 1: I would put it up there.

737
00:37:08,661 --> 00:37:08,983
Speaker 1: It's good.

738
00:37:09,927 --> 00:37:12,318
Speaker 0: Uh, so then it's like, follow up to your name.

739
00:37:12,378 --> 00:37:12,780
Speaker 0: Here I go.

740
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,665
Speaker 0: Weathering with you.

741
00:37:13,785 --> 00:37:15,335
Speaker 1: Literally about skies and weather.

742
00:37:15,456 --> 00:37:16,422
Speaker 0: I got to give you credit.

743
00:37:16,884 --> 00:37:18,352
Speaker 0: You know what your thing is.

744
00:37:18,432 --> 00:37:20,342
Speaker 0: It's lover, server, space and time and weather.

745
00:37:20,362 --> 00:37:23,092
Speaker 0: You're just going all in and weathering with you.

746
00:37:23,533 --> 00:37:25,682
Speaker 0: W E A T H. I'm not backing.

747
00:37:25,762 --> 00:37:26,646
Speaker 1: I know who I am.

748
00:37:26,666 --> 00:37:27,691
Speaker 0: I'm a koto Shinkai.

749
00:37:27,932 --> 00:37:28,816
Speaker 0: This is what I do.

750
00:37:29,097 --> 00:37:30,223
Speaker 0: Watch me do it more.

751
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:36,858
Speaker 0: I'm not going to, I'm not going to try to do something different or try to show people that I'm, that I have skills that I can vary my game.

752
00:37:36,878 --> 00:37:39,630
Speaker 0: I'm just going to master my one thing.

753
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,750
Speaker 0: The way it's a very Joe, a guy, Richie mastered a certain kind of movie.

754
00:37:43,810 --> 00:37:45,358
Speaker 0: I think it's a very Japanese thing.

755
00:37:45,459 --> 00:37:46,765
Speaker 0: Also, like I'm the sushi chef.

756
00:37:46,845 --> 00:37:48,595
Speaker 0: I master the sushi, right?

757
00:37:48,836 --> 00:37:51,089
Speaker 0: It's like a thing where the, you know, they hone, they're all.

758
00:37:51,109 --> 00:37:53,844
Speaker 0: of course, there is a long history of honing craft.

759
00:37:53,924 --> 00:38:00,490
Speaker 1: There is one deviation because children who chase lost voices felt like an air Satsumi, a sake movie.

760
00:38:00,811 --> 00:38:02,861
Speaker 1: Yes, but it didn't feel like the rest of them.

761
00:38:02,921 --> 00:38:05,513
Speaker 1: It just felt empty and broken.

762
00:38:05,573 --> 00:38:06,537
Speaker 0: I hardly remember anything.

763
00:38:06,557 --> 00:38:08,650
Speaker 0: I just remember that it was really boring.

764
00:38:08,670 --> 00:38:09,637
Speaker 0: And I understand what's going on.

765
00:38:09,657 --> 00:38:14,627
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure we reviewed, I'm pretty sure we reviewed almost the U S premiere at the New York comic con.

766
00:38:14,747 --> 00:38:20,575
Speaker 0: And then we saw an interview and he was there in person, but yeah, I don't remember the movie was no good.

767
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:21,880
Speaker 1: Air Satsumi, a sake.

768
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:30,759
Speaker 0: I'm telling you the point is, uh, weathering with you came to the U S and not only is it think still in theaters and places it's popular.

769
00:38:30,779 --> 00:38:33,315
Speaker 0: It's doing really well mostly because of the success of your name.

770
00:38:33,375 --> 00:38:36,149
Speaker 0: weathering with you got, you know, got to have a bigger run.

771
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:39,381
Speaker 0: They're also showing it in four DX, right?

772
00:38:39,402 --> 00:38:40,266
Speaker 0: So I don't know if people know.

773
00:38:40,327 --> 00:38:43,543
Speaker 0: this four DX is basically amusement park theater.

774
00:38:43,744 --> 00:38:47,621
Speaker 0: You sit in like a seat that moves and like they spray water on you.

775
00:38:47,681 --> 00:38:48,465
Speaker 0: It's like fucking honey.

776
00:38:48,525 --> 00:38:56,263
Speaker 0: I shrunk the kids or, you know, Terminator with the 3d glasses where, you know, seats are moving and they're, they're blowing air on you.

777
00:38:56,404 --> 00:38:57,770
Speaker 0: So it's a movie about weather.

778
00:38:58,092 --> 00:39:14,179
Speaker 0: So I presume that if you go see this in 40 X, which I did not, that they would like spray you during, you know, water scenes or shoot you with that gun, shake you during chase scenes or jolt you during, you know, gunfire firing scenes, fucking gun.

779
00:39:14,199 --> 00:39:16,329
Speaker 0: So if you want to go see it that way, be my guest.

780
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:21,597
Speaker 0: I've heard mixed opinions on how that is, but I just saw it in the normal theater, the normal way.

781
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:23,969
Speaker 1: Now it's also like it won four Annie awards.

782
00:39:24,532 --> 00:39:25,598
Speaker 1: Uh, it is the, it's not like.

783
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:28,916
Speaker 0: there's a lot of competition this year, including best independent animated feature.

784
00:39:28,936 --> 00:39:36,151
Speaker 1: It's the third anime film tying spirited away and millennium actress to have four nominations, highest anime film in the antes.

785
00:39:36,372 --> 00:39:36,935
Speaker 1: Yep.

786
00:39:36,975 --> 00:39:37,679
Speaker 1: Bunch of stuff here.

787
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:40,999
Speaker 1: You can read the Wikipedia and like news articles about all those details.

788
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:42,450
Speaker 0: So I think, you know, he followed up your name.

789
00:39:42,471 --> 00:39:45,330
Speaker 0: I don't think it's as good as your name, but let's talk about what it is.

790
00:39:45,451 --> 00:39:46,899
Speaker 1: So we won't spoil anything yet.

791
00:39:46,939 --> 00:39:52,465
Speaker 1: Cause just what we will talk, we will shift into spoilers so we can talk about, I don't think you need to spoil that much.

792
00:39:52,686 --> 00:39:59,475
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to, I don't like some of the readings of like how you can interpret this movie.

793
00:39:59,555 --> 00:39:59,857
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

794
00:40:00,098 --> 00:40:14,284
Speaker 1: I feel like it's, I don't know if it was, if some of the readings are intentional, I'm worried about his opinions on things and if they're unintentional, then they were poorly, uh, not proper care was not taken, but I would not send an incorrect message.

795
00:40:14,325 --> 00:40:17,140
Speaker 1: But the things I will say are one, it is utterly beautiful.

796
00:40:17,761 --> 00:40:19,067
Speaker 1: Like the animation is superb.

797
00:40:19,087 --> 00:40:20,293
Speaker 1: It looks great.

798
00:40:20,413 --> 00:40:27,202
Speaker 0: It looks like, you know, as, as good as end or better than your name, you know, and he brings up the hallmark cloud.

799
00:40:27,222 --> 00:40:28,105
Speaker 0: It's like, you still got it.

800
00:40:28,326 --> 00:40:31,318
Speaker 1: It is, it is very funny at many moments.

801
00:40:31,840 --> 00:40:34,754
Speaker 1: Like it is a funny movie, but also serious.

802
00:40:34,774 --> 00:40:34,895
Speaker 0: Yeah.

803
00:40:34,915 --> 00:40:43,303
Speaker 0: There was definitely, I think more comedy than your name because there were the side characters had more screen time.

804
00:40:43,906 --> 00:40:49,556
Speaker 0: And this, I do like the fact that, you know, a lot of times there'll be animes where you have a side character, right?

805
00:40:49,656 --> 00:40:53,035
Speaker 0: And the side character is way cool, but you hardly see them at all.

806
00:40:53,055 --> 00:40:54,341
Speaker 0: They don't get a lot of time, right?

807
00:40:54,361 --> 00:41:03,017
Speaker 0: So for example, Promare had lots of cool side characters, like a whole bunch of them, but individually, any one of them barely got enough play.

808
00:41:03,037 --> 00:41:03,098
Speaker 0: Yep.

809
00:41:03,339 --> 00:41:07,539
Speaker 0: So even though that Robo has that problem, they had their cool scene, right?

810
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:08,644
Speaker 0: And then that was sort of it.

811
00:41:08,664 --> 00:41:14,209
Speaker 0: Like, think about say a Promare, uh, adjacent, uh, story tank police, right?

812
00:41:14,350 --> 00:41:16,663
Speaker 0: There's the chief who's bad-ass and awesome and hilarious.

813
00:41:17,065 --> 00:41:19,178
Speaker 0: And the chief has like a couple of scenes, right?

814
00:41:19,218 --> 00:41:20,082
Speaker 1: And I would watch that.

815
00:41:20,825 --> 00:41:24,078
Speaker 1: You can tell it's a show like that or a movie like that.

816
00:41:24,199 --> 00:41:32,274
Speaker 1: If you would legitimately be excited, if someone named any character from that show and said, they're getting a spinoff movie just about them, right?

817
00:41:32,314 --> 00:41:39,912
Speaker 0: So here it's more of a cowboy bebop situation where the side characters, you know, Ed Ein, whatever, there's not too many of them, right?

818
00:41:40,033 --> 00:41:42,184
Speaker 0: And they get plenty of screen time each.

819
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:50,001
Speaker 0: And therefore the more humorous side characters continually bring their humor more throughout the movie and they're present throughout the movie.

820
00:41:50,021 --> 00:41:51,811
Speaker 0: They're not like, you know, your name.

821
00:41:51,872 --> 00:41:53,984
Speaker 0: I felt like they were more present.

822
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:54,729
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

823
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:55,495
Speaker 0: I only saw it once.

824
00:41:55,555 --> 00:42:00,882
Speaker 0: I don't remember a hundred percent of it, but I felt like those side characters were present earlier in the movie.

825
00:42:00,922 --> 00:42:03,918
Speaker 0: And then towards the end and climax were left in the town.

826
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:06,575
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, because the main characters left the scene.

827
00:42:06,595 --> 00:42:11,082
Speaker 1: Well, cause they sort of bookended the, cause the main journey of the movie was just the two main characters.

828
00:42:11,142 --> 00:42:11,665
Speaker 0: Exactly.

829
00:42:11,705 --> 00:42:19,687
Speaker 0: Whereas here in weathering with you, those side characters are there throughout, like they don't disappear even like up to the last second.

830
00:42:19,949 --> 00:42:24,131
Speaker 0: You're not like escaping the funny part and going just with the main characters who aren't humorous.

831
00:42:24,553 --> 00:42:27,247
Speaker 0: And also the main characters had some humor in themselves.

832
00:42:27,549 --> 00:42:31,366
Speaker 0: They weren't purely just, you know, the romance, even though they were.

833
00:42:31,809 --> 00:42:38,881
Speaker 1: So the vague plot is this young boy runs away from home for reasons that are not explained and tries to make it in the city.

834
00:42:40,126 --> 00:42:41,591
Speaker 0: He lives on an island.

835
00:42:41,631 --> 00:42:44,624
Speaker 0: So he had to take a boat to go to Tokyo right?

836
00:42:44,644 --> 00:42:47,037
Speaker 0: So I guess he lived on, what's the Southern island in Japan?

837
00:42:47,077 --> 00:42:47,439
Speaker 0: The big one.

838
00:42:48,820 --> 00:42:50,634
Speaker 1: Well, you're talking about the main Japanese islands.

839
00:42:50,694 --> 00:42:50,956
Speaker 0: No, no.

840
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:51,883
Speaker 0: What does the main one?

841
00:42:51,923 --> 00:42:53,836
Speaker 0: And then the big fat one that's underneath.

842
00:42:53,916 --> 00:42:56,086
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure he came from the big, what?

843
00:42:57,271 --> 00:42:57,773
Speaker 0: Chikoku.

844
00:42:58,094 --> 00:42:59,580
Speaker 0: Oh, the one that's like, sounds like hell.

845
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:02,644
Speaker 1: Chikoku.

846
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:03,647
Speaker 1: Right there.

847
00:43:03,687 --> 00:43:04,028
Speaker 1: That one.

848
00:43:04,129 --> 00:43:04,932
Speaker 1: Yeah.

849
00:43:05,092 --> 00:43:08,265
Speaker 0: He's from not the same island that Tokyo is on.

850
00:43:08,386 --> 00:43:10,297
Speaker 0: And so we had to take a boat to go to Tokyo.

851
00:43:10,318 --> 00:43:11,626
Speaker 0: and that's sort of how the movie opens.

852
00:43:11,928 --> 00:43:12,170
Speaker 1: Yep.

853
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:14,344
Speaker 1: And he's like clearly like running away from home.

854
00:43:14,385 --> 00:43:18,649
Speaker 1: Like it's not clear if he's abused, like what's going on, but he's no real explanation for why.

855
00:43:18,669 --> 00:43:28,071
Speaker 0: If kid is running away from home to make a life in Tokyo and is not a legal adult in any way, definitely a high school student who is not going to high school.

856
00:43:28,151 --> 00:43:32,553
Speaker 1: And this is a movie that is set in modern times with cell phones and cameras and things.

857
00:43:32,634 --> 00:43:35,064
Speaker 1: So like he can't just get a job.

858
00:43:35,485 --> 00:43:40,988
Speaker 1: Like he ends up having to work illegally for someone and like kind of just live in his office.

859
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:41,430
Speaker 0: Yep.

860
00:43:41,892 --> 00:43:43,780
Speaker 0: And it seems like the dude is shady.

861
00:43:43,881 --> 00:43:47,484
Speaker 0: Like you think it's going to be a Yakuza situation, but no, the dude is actually okay.

862
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:47,665
Speaker 1: Yep.

863
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:51,807
Speaker 0: Even though the business they're in is not like, it's not an illegitimate business.

864
00:43:51,867 --> 00:43:53,577
Speaker 0: It's just not like a great business.

865
00:43:53,617 --> 00:43:53,818
Speaker 0: Yep.

866
00:43:54,019 --> 00:43:55,224
Speaker 1: It's basically a tabloid.

867
00:43:55,245 --> 00:43:55,666
Speaker 1: Yeah.

868
00:43:55,867 --> 00:43:59,544
Speaker 1: Like a, but it seems to actually world news level tabloid.

869
00:43:59,584 --> 00:44:00,933
Speaker 0: It seems to actually make some money.

870
00:44:00,953 --> 00:44:03,147
Speaker 0: It actually doesn't seem like they make their own tabloid.

871
00:44:03,188 --> 00:44:06,526
Speaker 0: It seems more like they're contracted to make content for other tabloids.

872
00:44:07,169 --> 00:44:08,595
Speaker 0: Anyway, it doesn't matter.

873
00:44:08,917 --> 00:44:10,222
Speaker 1: And you know, things happen.

874
00:44:10,343 --> 00:44:11,568
Speaker 1: It's just moderately long.

875
00:44:11,588 --> 00:44:11,990
Speaker 1: It was 112 minutes.

876
00:44:12,010 --> 00:44:17,933
Speaker 1: And he ends up meeting this girl who is kind of like a weather witch, right?

877
00:44:17,973 --> 00:44:23,854
Speaker 0: So the thing is, as you're watching the movie, it's basically always raining.

878
00:44:24,015 --> 00:44:26,484
Speaker 0: It's set always, it is heavily implied.

879
00:44:26,524 --> 00:44:31,447
Speaker 1: It's set during an era of extreme climate change that is slowly flooding Japan, right?

880
00:44:31,587 --> 00:44:41,468
Speaker 0: In the same way that when you watch Evangelion, it's eternal summer and you sorta like it, you know, it's not pointed out to you so strongly here.

881
00:44:41,548 --> 00:44:46,466
Speaker 0: It's pointed out more strongly than an Evangelion, but it's like, yeah, it's always raining.

882
00:44:46,888 --> 00:44:50,438
Speaker 0: It's almost never not raining.

883
00:44:50,598 --> 00:44:54,798
Speaker 1: Sunshine is rare to the point that if the sun comes out, like people freak out.

884
00:44:54,958 --> 00:44:55,179
Speaker 0: Yeah.

885
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:56,165
Speaker 0: It's like, Oh, the sun is out.

886
00:44:56,205 --> 00:44:56,467
Speaker 0: Yes.

887
00:44:56,929 --> 00:44:57,331
Speaker 0: Finally.

888
00:44:57,372 --> 00:44:58,518
Speaker 0: There's a brief moment of sun.

889
00:44:58,599 --> 00:44:58,760
Speaker 0: Yes.

890
00:44:59,041 --> 00:44:59,362
Speaker 0: Right.

891
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:02,697
Speaker 0: It's not like unusual that people haven't forgotten the sun.

892
00:45:02,717 --> 00:45:08,563
Speaker 0: It's just sort of like, yeah, it started raining a while ago and it really hasn't stopped in a long time.

893
00:45:08,604 --> 00:45:12,660
Speaker 0: And if it's not raining, it's still gray and drizzly and meh.

894
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:18,462
Speaker 1: This is so pervasive and such an integral part of like the theme and everything about the movie.

895
00:45:18,502 --> 00:45:29,048
Speaker 0: But also it gives them a chance to flex his cloud because the strong visual contrast between the constant gloominess and all right, I'm going to put a meaningful scene.

896
00:45:29,088 --> 00:45:33,591
Speaker 0: I can just open up the clouds and get boom, instant contrast, visually instant meaning.

897
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:34,896
Speaker 0: And it's so easy.

898
00:45:35,317 --> 00:45:41,056
Speaker 0: And to do and he's making like that plot and that visual motif.

899
00:45:41,537 --> 00:45:43,243
Speaker 0: Also, the thing that he is the best at.

900
00:45:43,544 --> 00:45:43,825
Speaker 0: Right.

901
00:45:43,986 --> 00:45:44,889
Speaker 0: All in one go.

902
00:45:44,990 --> 00:45:46,556
Speaker 0: It's like, aha, I have craft.

903
00:45:46,616 --> 00:45:48,524
Speaker 0: It's like, I'm really good at this thing.

904
00:45:48,866 --> 00:45:53,245
Speaker 0: Let me write a plot that makes being good at that thing really use.

905
00:45:53,325 --> 00:45:54,008
Speaker 0: Right.

906
00:45:54,469 --> 00:45:57,240
Speaker 0: So this girl is like making a sheath to fit your sword.

907
00:45:57,561 --> 00:46:03,510
Speaker 1: So basically this girl he meets, who's a little, it seems to be a little bit older than him and kind of has her like her act together.

908
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:07,286
Speaker 0: She can summon sunlight, right?

909
00:46:07,346 --> 00:46:10,881
Speaker 0: It seems at first, it seems like some sort of, you know, like, can.

910
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:13,753
Speaker 0: she really is a coincidence, but it's like gradually.

911
00:46:13,773 --> 00:46:18,251
Speaker 0: it's like, no, it seems like the rain is actually some sort of angry rain God.

912
00:46:18,753 --> 00:46:30,504
Speaker 0: And she has some sort of spiritual meaning, power, some kind of connection to the, whatever the God based on some ancient thing, like ancient writings and like knowledge that is kind of lost.

913
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:34,140
Speaker 1: Like there's one old priest who kind of knows the deal, right?

914
00:46:34,301 --> 00:46:38,060
Speaker 0: She can make it, you know, by, by praying and concentrating or whatever.

915
00:46:38,441 --> 00:46:42,455
Speaker 0: She can make it be sunny around her in an area for a period of time.

916
00:46:42,475 --> 00:46:53,790
Speaker 1: And the movie is about all these things and we're going to, we're going to, I'm not going to like explain the plot, but from this point on, I'm going to react to the conclusion to this movie.

917
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:57,761
Speaker 1: So if you haven't seen it and you don't want anything to be spoiled, you should probably stop listening now and come back.

918
00:46:58,263 --> 00:46:58,384
Speaker 0: Yeah.

919
00:46:58,404 --> 00:47:02,380
Speaker 0: But the conclusion you should draw, uh, is that you go see it.

920
00:47:02,601 --> 00:47:03,082
Speaker 1: It's okay.

921
00:47:03,163 --> 00:47:08,062
Speaker 0: Don't expect it to be like the best thing you've ever seen, but it ain't bad.

922
00:47:08,123 --> 00:47:15,154
Speaker 1: And it's worth going to the theater, but I am bothered by some of the apparent morals and themes of this movie.

923
00:47:15,315 --> 00:47:15,536
Speaker 1: Yeah.

924
00:47:15,656 --> 00:47:15,917
Speaker 0: All right.

925
00:47:15,938 --> 00:47:18,269
Speaker 0: So what are the morals and themes of this movie that bother us?

926
00:47:18,530 --> 00:47:27,641
Speaker 1: So on one hand, I mean the plot and again, spoilers once you find out that that girl who seems so together is actually like really young and like kind of in the same boat as the kid.

927
00:47:28,485 --> 00:47:30,373
Speaker 0: And well, she didn't run away.

928
00:47:30,453 --> 00:47:31,216
Speaker 0: Her parents died.

929
00:47:31,236 --> 00:47:31,638
Speaker 0: Yep.

930
00:47:31,718 --> 00:47:34,674
Speaker 0: But then she tried to make it on her own without the authorities.

931
00:47:34,714 --> 00:47:42,252
Speaker 1: Cause they, they would separate her from her brother, but he like doesn't have his act together and has all this baggage that's out in front.

932
00:47:42,312 --> 00:47:45,229
Speaker 1: And he sees her as very competent and stable relative to him.

933
00:47:45,289 --> 00:47:45,410
Speaker 0: Right.

934
00:47:45,430 --> 00:47:50,275
Speaker 0: Well, cause she's taken care of a brother, like sort of does have some shit together, but it did.

935
00:47:50,356 --> 00:47:59,745
Speaker 1: The big reveal is that she has her own like equivalent level of baggage and the two of them together, you know, the, the title weathering with you or weathering you want to get argue.

936
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:04,612
Speaker 1: There is a reading that this is about the way relationships form and how people bring baggage together.

937
00:48:04,632 --> 00:48:08,552
Speaker 1: And you almost have to weather each other and then together weather the world.

938
00:48:08,572 --> 00:48:11,607
Speaker 1: And like that feels like a very Magoto Shinkai kind of reading.

939
00:48:11,748 --> 00:48:11,969
Speaker 1: Yep.

940
00:48:12,070 --> 00:48:19,636
Speaker 1: And I feel like that is one of the primary readings of this, but it's set in an era of climate change.

941
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:27,026
Speaker 0: And if this came out, even 10 years ago, you would never do the climate change reading of this right ever.

942
00:48:27,348 --> 00:48:41,037
Speaker 1: But, but because it comes out in 2020, you have to, and it seems to make this point that young people like her who have this power can work hard and sort of sacrifice themselves to make the rain go away.

943
00:48:41,057 --> 00:48:46,740
Speaker 1: But the moral of the movie almost seems to be children should not try to do that.

944
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:49,291
Speaker 1: Don't throw your life away trying to save the world.

945
00:48:49,612 --> 00:48:52,042
Speaker 1: Just whether the world that will come.

946
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:53,971
Speaker 1: your children, it's not your fault, right?

947
00:48:54,051 --> 00:48:56,661
Speaker 0: So basically give up, right?

948
00:48:57,203 --> 00:49:07,607
Speaker 0: So what they're trying to do is they make this illusion that, yeah, way back in the ancient times, they would like sacrifice the local witch, you know, to the gods to appease them.

949
00:49:07,989 --> 00:49:10,038
Speaker 0: And that would make the rain go away, right?

950
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,802
Speaker 0: But they haven't done that in a long time because, uh, we don't do that shit anymore.

951
00:49:14,565 --> 00:49:16,494
Speaker 0: And she just happens to be the weather witch.

952
00:49:16,795 --> 00:49:28,604
Speaker 1: So they could sacrifice her to the god and make it the sun come back in the same way that the youth of the world could sacrifice their childhood to like actively fight for climate reform.

953
00:49:28,684 --> 00:49:28,966
Speaker 1: Right.

954
00:49:29,569 --> 00:49:39,207
Speaker 0: Uh, and then in the end, the dude, the main character dude chooses to not have his love separated by space and time and bring her back and make it rain forever.

955
00:49:39,227 --> 00:49:47,783
Speaker 0: And then what they illustrate is a world where the rain continues nonstop pretty much and Japan like starts getting destroyed.

956
00:49:48,044 --> 00:49:52,663
Speaker 0: Like Tokyo is like sinking, like a lot of it, like, you know, Akira situation.

957
00:49:52,945 --> 00:49:54,492
Speaker 1: fast forward time skips to the future.

958
00:49:54,512 --> 00:50:00,018
Speaker 1: He, they come back together a few years later, like the world is approaching ruin, right?

959
00:50:00,058 --> 00:50:00,883
Speaker 0: The world is approaching.

960
00:50:00,903 --> 00:50:04,143
Speaker 0: Like you look and they show you a picture of like most of Tokyo underwater.

961
00:50:04,163 --> 00:50:09,407
Speaker 0: And then they show you people like adapting to it and just getting along just fine.

962
00:50:09,428 --> 00:50:15,099
Speaker 0: The dude who was in a tabloid office underneath the building is now in a much better office because he also grew up.

963
00:50:15,159 --> 00:50:17,778
Speaker 1: I'll get to that third reading about like growing up, which is also there.

964
00:50:17,818 --> 00:50:19,468
Speaker 0: He got his family back together.

965
00:50:19,548 --> 00:50:20,232
Speaker 0: It's like, okay.

966
00:50:20,272 --> 00:50:22,103
Speaker 0: He finished high school, he got it done.

967
00:50:22,123 --> 00:50:25,098
Speaker 0: And then he went back to Tokyo and met the girl again.

968
00:50:25,159 --> 00:50:26,709
Speaker 0: And now they're happy that they're together.

969
00:50:26,749 --> 00:50:29,745
Speaker 1: It's more of like, you can weather the storm, the world will change.

970
00:50:29,886 --> 00:50:31,332
Speaker 1: Just try to adapt to it.

971
00:50:32,055 --> 00:50:32,979
Speaker 1: Fuck that noise.

972
00:50:33,019 --> 00:50:33,260
Speaker 1: Right.

973
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,257
Speaker 0: It's like, uh, are you trying to say that the climate check?

974
00:50:36,297 --> 00:50:41,686
Speaker 0: if New York flooded the way Tokyo flooded in that image that you could, we would be able to just deal with it.

975
00:50:41,746 --> 00:50:50,683
Speaker 0: And there wouldn't be a global catastrophe that results in like, you know, riots, global emergency, disease, war, famine, et cetera.

976
00:50:50,803 --> 00:51:01,835
Speaker 0: It definitely portrays the world where people at this, not something you can, like he shows modern Western society continuing and thriving and adapting to a great catastrophe.

977
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:04,024
Speaker 0: It's like, bro, that's not how it's going to go.

978
00:51:04,124 --> 00:51:04,385
Speaker 1: Nope.

979
00:51:04,927 --> 00:51:06,152
Speaker 0: That's not how it's going to be.

980
00:51:07,055 --> 00:51:10,568
Speaker 0: And if Tokyo sinks that much, Japan is boned.

981
00:51:10,789 --> 00:51:13,017
Speaker 0: And my real word is like, no food.

982
00:51:13,037 --> 00:51:21,527
Speaker 1: Like, if you watch this movie, this is not a, like a stretch as a real economic disaster and center.

983
00:51:21,547 --> 00:51:29,991
Speaker 0: Like you could make a video essay about how that is the moral of the Japanese people would like you to, I can, you know, continue even having, you know, anything.

984
00:51:30,333 --> 00:51:37,205
Speaker 1: And they even like the movie gets like, makes this point over and over again that if it's not your fault, it's not your responsibility.

985
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:45,607
Speaker 1: And the reality is for young people in the world today, yes, it's not your fault, but it kind of is going to be your responsibility because old people failed.

986
00:51:45,648 --> 00:52:01,962
Speaker 0: Well, it also portrays the right by using, you know, the, uh, the story of, you know, the ancient story of like, oh, God's making the weather sacrifice to the, you know, your, your weather, which to them to appease them, portrays the climate change as not your fault.

987
00:52:02,042 --> 00:52:10,570
Speaker 0: And as a natural thing, as a God thing, as opposed to a thing that was caused by the people, right?

988
00:52:10,630 --> 00:52:12,238
Speaker 0: They caused the bad weather.

989
00:52:12,338 --> 00:52:16,077
Speaker 0: It's not the people aren't sacrificing to get rid of the bad weather.

990
00:52:16,098 --> 00:52:17,766
Speaker 0: They made the bad weather in a nice place.

991
00:52:17,947 --> 00:52:20,199
Speaker 0: And the sacrifice is not a natural thing.

992
00:52:20,219 --> 00:52:26,110
Speaker 1: The sacrifice as portrayed is not really like sacrifice people to our God.

993
00:52:26,231 --> 00:52:33,652
Speaker 1: It's a third reading that is probably good.

994
00:52:33,712 --> 00:52:46,272
Speaker 1: before I get into the last thing that annoys me about the movie, which is the gun, the gun bothers, the gun would have been fine if they didn't use it multiple times and it didn't drive the plot forward twice by being fired.

995
00:52:46,614 --> 00:52:46,794
Speaker 0: Right.

996
00:52:46,815 --> 00:52:56,800
Speaker 0: It seems like the lower level, the lower level things in the movie, like the character lines and those stories, like about the, the, the niece of the, the business guy, right.

997
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:05,444
Speaker 0: And like the business guy himself getting his, you know, his divorce and his child custody situation, all those things, those things I think are all good story.

998
00:53:05,484 --> 00:53:10,672
Speaker 1: Cause they get back to that first thing about weathering with you or weathering you like weather the world together.

999
00:53:10,692 --> 00:53:13,929
Speaker 1: together, you can weather catastrophe better than separated.

1000
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:23,631
Speaker 1: Although there's a lot going on there, but it also has this reading of like, the kid doesn't want to give up on whatever his dreams were and why he ran away.

1001
00:53:23,651 --> 00:53:29,540
Speaker 1: The moral was sort of suck it up, go back and live the life you hate to become an adult and be responsible.

1002
00:53:30,321 --> 00:53:38,779
Speaker 1: And it lays that template out for literally every character we're introduced to of suck it up, be an adult and join normal society.

1003
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:45,660
Speaker 0: And this coming from someone who made, who is, I guess doing, who knows, I forget what his job was at the time, but he made an anime in his basement and got lucky.

1004
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:46,462
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1005
00:53:46,523 --> 00:53:47,467
Speaker 0: Also made a good anime.

1006
00:53:47,508 --> 00:53:47,709
Speaker 0: Yup.

1007
00:53:48,452 --> 00:53:51,914
Speaker 1: But it like, we don't know what he was running from, like why he was running away from home.

1008
00:53:51,974 --> 00:53:53,505
Speaker 1: It's easy to see that he might've been abused.

1009
00:53:53,525 --> 00:53:59,277
Speaker 0: Like there's something up with, they never say why he ran away from home, but there was no indication of abuse.

1010
00:53:59,297 --> 00:54:00,785
Speaker 0: They never show you his parents.

1011
00:54:00,886 --> 00:54:02,497
Speaker 0: You don't know if he has siblings or anything.

1012
00:54:02,718 --> 00:54:11,556
Speaker 1: But they definitely imply when he goes back home, like, and then there's the time skip at the end of the movie, that he was miserable there and counted the seconds until he could leave and he just sucked it up.

1013
00:54:11,576 --> 00:54:13,287
Speaker 1: And then you get the cool guy who ran the tabloid.

1014
00:54:13,649 --> 00:54:17,108
Speaker 1: And now he's like a normal stuffy businessman because that was the right thing to do.

1015
00:54:18,173 --> 00:54:19,801
Speaker 1: And everyone like became a normal adult.

1016
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:22,236
Speaker 0: It helped him get his, you know, time with his kid again.

1017
00:54:22,256 --> 00:54:22,497
Speaker 0: Yup.

1018
00:54:22,517 --> 00:54:22,719
Speaker 1: Right.

1019
00:54:23,041 --> 00:54:32,128
Speaker 0: Because, you know, if you're a dude who lives in a basement, it's harder to convince the, you know, them to let you see your child than if you are a successful business person.

1020
00:54:32,289 --> 00:54:48,272
Speaker 1: But at the same time, that could almost be more an indictment of society's expectations, but the movie portrays it more as suck it up and join society as it is, which leads back into another bad interpretation that it almost has this undercurrent of.

1021
00:54:48,774 --> 00:54:56,464
Speaker 1: you've got to not like stand out or buck the system so that you can have harmony together to weather the world around you.

1022
00:54:57,489 --> 00:55:06,083
Speaker 0: And I don't, I think is, you know, it's, and that's the thing is that lesson is fine in some contexts, but not in the context of a global catastrophe.

1023
00:55:06,143 --> 00:55:06,465
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1024
00:55:06,605 --> 00:55:06,886
Speaker 0: Right.

1025
00:55:07,087 --> 00:55:12,608
Speaker 0: So the, the show, the, the putting them both together like that is the real problem.

1026
00:55:13,029 --> 00:55:17,805
Speaker 0: If it was something else besides climate change that you showed, right.

1027
00:55:17,905 --> 00:55:19,491
Speaker 0: It could have worked, right.

1028
00:55:19,772 --> 00:55:22,080
Speaker 0: But not climate change.

1029
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:24,654
Speaker 1: And they almost could have gotten away with this.

1030
00:55:24,694 --> 00:55:28,576
Speaker 1: Like the movie could have gotten away with it, except that it portrays a sunken and ruined Tokyo.

1031
00:55:28,616 --> 00:55:30,004
Speaker 1: And yet everyone's just totally fine.

1032
00:55:30,184 --> 00:55:30,386
Speaker 0: Right.

1033
00:55:30,406 --> 00:55:31,552
Speaker 0: It's like people have adapted.

1034
00:55:31,592 --> 00:55:35,130
Speaker 0: They're using boats and they're wearing long boots.

1035
00:55:35,171 --> 00:55:36,658
Speaker 0: They got their umbrellas out all the time.

1036
00:55:36,698 --> 00:55:37,803
Speaker 0: They're just, they're dealing with it.

1037
00:55:38,446 --> 00:55:39,310
Speaker 0: Life is going on.

1038
00:55:39,350 --> 00:55:40,797
Speaker 0: The economy's not ruined.

1039
00:55:41,139 --> 00:55:42,926
Speaker 0: Somehow everyone still has food.

1040
00:55:43,007 --> 00:55:45,497
Speaker 0: Somehow the electricity still works.

1041
00:55:45,819 --> 00:55:49,759
Speaker 0: All these giant buildings and entire neighborhoods of downtown are completely underwater.

1042
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:55,546
Speaker 1: If the ocean like rises too much, New York, isn't just going to be a bunch of canals among skyscrapers.

1043
00:55:55,606 --> 00:55:57,395
Speaker 1: It's going to be on fire and abandoned.

1044
00:55:57,777 --> 00:55:57,998
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1045
00:55:58,299 --> 00:56:01,231
Speaker 0: It's going to be fucking like escape from New York, but no, for real.

1046
00:56:01,894 --> 00:56:03,220
Speaker 0: So not a joke.

1047
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,988
Speaker 1: The gun on one hand.

1048
00:56:06,008 --> 00:56:10,564
Speaker 0: So a gun is a big deal in any Japanese movie, except maybe a Yakuza movie.

1049
00:56:10,584 --> 00:56:17,975
Speaker 1: But even then, like even in Yakuza, because like that old, that old movie, which we love, like nobody has guns.

1050
00:56:18,055 --> 00:56:21,432
Speaker 0: And at one point, the cops have to go get their guns from the special place.

1051
00:56:21,452 --> 00:56:30,254
Speaker 1: Like there's a big plot point where a crazy dude has a gun and no cops have a gun and they got to go get permission to get their guns out, but they don't.

1052
00:56:30,294 --> 00:56:31,844
Speaker 1: They just talk the guy down and take his gun away.

1053
00:56:32,005 --> 00:56:32,226
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1054
00:56:32,307 --> 00:56:34,197
Speaker 0: And like knives are a big deal, right?

1055
00:56:34,358 --> 00:56:37,370
Speaker 0: Like in Japan, any Japanese thing, guns are a big deal.

1056
00:56:37,993 --> 00:56:44,180
Speaker 0: Uh, and this movie early on, the kid finds a gun in a trash can outside of a strip club or a whorehouse.

1057
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:44,521
Speaker 1: Right.

1058
00:56:44,541 --> 00:56:46,996
Speaker 0: And it's basically what some Yakuza guy dumped it there.

1059
00:56:47,016 --> 00:56:47,559
Speaker 0: Right.

1060
00:56:47,620 --> 00:56:51,435
Speaker 0: And the kid by random chance finds it and has it.

1061
00:56:51,656 --> 00:56:53,805
Speaker 1: But right then he basically gets attacked by a pimp.

1062
00:56:54,227 --> 00:57:01,118
Speaker 1: And because he has this gun, he pulls it out and shoots at the pimp at the end of the air, which scares the pimp away.

1063
00:57:01,138 --> 00:57:01,379
Speaker 1: Right.

1064
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:04,494
Speaker 0: And that's, and then he, you know, fine.

1065
00:57:04,534 --> 00:57:05,539
Speaker 1: That drives some of the plot.

1066
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:08,562
Speaker 1: Now there's a reason for the police to be looking for him, which escalates the attention.

1067
00:57:08,703 --> 00:57:10,614
Speaker 0: Like he abandons the gun in this building.

1068
00:57:10,775 --> 00:57:10,976
Speaker 0: Yep.

1069
00:57:10,996 --> 00:57:11,982
Speaker 1: Like he leaves it somewhere.

1070
00:57:12,022 --> 00:57:14,840
Speaker 0: And the building is sort of like the central building in the movie.

1071
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:17,473
Speaker 0: It reminds me of the building in the matrix that they go back.

1072
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:18,117
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1073
00:57:18,479 --> 00:57:19,807
Speaker 1: I got that same impression.

1074
00:57:19,988 --> 00:57:22,202
Speaker 0: Uh, the, what are the heart of the city hotel in the matrix?

1075
00:57:22,383 --> 00:57:25,116
Speaker 0: Like he going back to that same place, right?

1076
00:57:25,156 --> 00:57:26,020
Speaker 0: This is that same thing.

1077
00:57:26,080 --> 00:57:30,829
Speaker 0: There's a building with a little shrine to the weather God on the roof, but also it's an abandoned building.

1078
00:57:30,849 --> 00:57:32,941
Speaker 1: It looks like it was ruined by the flooding, right?

1079
00:57:32,981 --> 00:57:35,454
Speaker 0: It's the plot place and they keep going back to it.

1080
00:57:35,494 --> 00:57:35,635
Speaker 0: Right.

1081
00:57:35,655 --> 00:57:40,035
Speaker 0: So the gun is at the, you know, an early scene, he abandons the gun there.

1082
00:57:40,055 --> 00:57:46,544
Speaker 0: And then very late in the movie, he's being chased after by the cops who think he has the gun when he doesn't.

1083
00:57:46,906 --> 00:57:47,168
Speaker 0: Right.

1084
00:57:47,590 --> 00:57:50,443
Speaker 0: And then they chase him to the place cause that's where he's going.

1085
00:57:50,463 --> 00:57:52,251
Speaker 0: And he picks up the gun while he's there.

1086
00:57:52,652 --> 00:58:01,569
Speaker 1: And he is able to save his lover separated by space and time, avoid the police and like solve everything by firing the gun in the air again.

1087
00:58:01,689 --> 00:58:01,950
Speaker 0: Yes.

1088
00:58:02,031 --> 00:58:17,208
Speaker 1: So the gun was a positive plot moving device that was required by this child's twice to assert authority on the world, which is a weird message to we, like, I don't know what message that gun was intended to portray.

1089
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:17,931
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1090
00:58:17,991 --> 00:58:18,453
Speaker 1: I don't know.

1091
00:58:18,835 --> 00:58:23,359
Speaker 1: Like the kid gets to wield the authority of an adult twice and it saves them both times.

1092
00:58:23,379 --> 00:58:25,028
Speaker 0: I mean, you can positive both times.

1093
00:58:25,048 --> 00:58:26,797
Speaker 0: You can see this connection, right?

1094
00:58:26,837 --> 00:58:32,904
Speaker 0: You can see the impact of a gun in a, in a Japanese setting and a Japanese movie to a Japanese audience.

1095
00:58:32,924 --> 00:58:33,528
Speaker 1: And it's awesome.

1096
00:58:33,569 --> 00:58:34,556
Speaker 1: It saves his life.

1097
00:58:34,576 --> 00:58:34,737
Speaker 0: Right.

1098
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:43,659
Speaker 0: You can see that the impact of the scene, you can, you can line both scenes up together and see how they're similar, but I can't understand like what the meaning is.

1099
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:44,222
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1100
00:58:44,503 --> 00:58:48,483
Speaker 0: Because if the meaning is, you could have done something else in a chase scene.

1101
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:55,051
Speaker 0: or if the meaning gauges back into like, you can't have something with that big an impact that has no meaning.

1102
00:58:55,231 --> 00:59:06,831
Speaker 1: Like shoujo kakame Utena kind of gets into that with the idea of like adults have a power to wield over the world that children don't, but children can sometimes acquire the tools of adults and wield that power in a local context.

1103
00:59:06,851 --> 00:59:08,662
Speaker 1: Like there's a, there's a way to look into this.

1104
00:59:09,285 --> 00:59:15,392
Speaker 1: And this movie could have been saying that that child needed that power of like being an adult or being in society.

1105
00:59:15,432 --> 00:59:20,040
Speaker 1: And the gun was a vehicle to wield that before he was ready or before society would give it to him.

1106
00:59:20,421 --> 00:59:28,233
Speaker 1: But at the same time, wielding a gun in Japanese society is extremely transgressive and thus ruins that entire reading of it kind of.

1107
00:59:28,414 --> 00:59:36,576
Speaker 0: also, uh, you know, most of the things that happen in the movie besides the supernatural weather control are completely realistic and modern, right?

1108
00:59:36,597 --> 00:59:39,571
Speaker 0: The way they use the internet to get jobs, right?

1109
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:42,486
Speaker 1: The way the hotels won't rent a room to them because exactly.

1110
00:59:42,506 --> 00:59:45,882
Speaker 0: And everything is super believable for a modern time, which is great to see.

1111
00:59:46,685 --> 00:59:56,975
Speaker 0: Uh, except for the fact that like, bro, if you had that gun and shoot it in the air, when there's cops right in front of you, they're not like sending you back home so you can finish high school.

1112
00:59:56,995 --> 00:59:57,658
Speaker 1: They kind of do.

1113
00:59:57,799 --> 00:59:58,582
Speaker 0: So right.

1114
00:59:58,903 --> 01:00:07,978
Speaker 0: You would be, I'm pretty sure you would be in jail, uh, for a long ass time because the Japanese justice system is, uh, not just right.

1115
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:11,397
Speaker 1: Not, not saying the U S one is no, but in Japan, it's even worse.

1116
01:00:11,417 --> 01:00:13,490
Speaker 0: You're just guilty until proven innocent over there.

1117
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:14,637
Speaker 1: The prosecutor better be right.

1118
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:17,228
Speaker 0: You know, they make you confess and then they sentence you.

1119
01:00:18,433 --> 01:00:19,196
Speaker 0: Uh, right.

1120
01:00:19,256 --> 01:00:22,148
Speaker 0: So yeah, but even slightly unbelievable.

1121
01:00:22,308 --> 01:00:29,540
Speaker 1: So there's this other undercurrent that there's this unexplored world of the sky that could solve climate change.

1122
01:00:30,260 --> 01:00:33,714
Speaker 1: And they prove it's real because the girl disappears up there.

1123
01:00:33,734 --> 01:00:33,794
Speaker 1: Yep.

1124
01:00:33,995 --> 01:00:36,505
Speaker 1: They should study that.

1125
01:00:36,525 --> 01:00:44,280
Speaker 0: They should send drones up into the clouds and try to figure out like they clearly show like the turtle rain God a couple of times.

1126
01:00:44,661 --> 01:00:45,908
Speaker 1: The movie almost makes this point.

1127
01:00:46,209 --> 01:00:49,122
Speaker 1: Only this don't try to solve the problem, right?

1128
01:00:49,142 --> 01:00:59,782
Speaker 0: This priest guy clearly knows everything that's up because he's a. this is absolutely a real thing and we could solve it by sacrificing our friend.

1129
01:00:59,882 --> 01:01:00,103
Speaker 0: Okay.

1130
01:01:00,123 --> 01:01:01,551
Speaker 0: We've decided not to do that.

1131
01:01:01,772 --> 01:01:05,471
Speaker 1: or let's fly up there and like investigate these sky fish that are slowly.

1132
01:01:05,491 --> 01:01:13,573
Speaker 0: And it's like, all right, well, you're not going to try anything to make it not rain and say, well, I guess if society is not ruined, you wouldn't care about trying.

1133
01:01:13,674 --> 01:01:13,895
Speaker 0: Yep.

1134
01:01:14,056 --> 01:01:14,358
Speaker 0: Right.

1135
01:01:14,458 --> 01:01:18,898
Speaker 0: But that's it is unrealistic that the society would not be ruined.

1136
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:28,062
Speaker 1: And I guess like in conclusion, just cause I'm hungry and I'm, I think I've done with the show here, all this combined left me very like unsatisfied and unsettled.

1137
01:01:28,103 --> 01:01:31,558
Speaker 1: after this movie, like after it ended, I just felt conflicted.

1138
01:01:31,578 --> 01:01:31,940
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1139
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:41,672
Speaker 1: I mean, there were definitely like, you know, great moments, like the little cards and who's dating every girl in his school and then the girl, like the girls help him escape from the college.

1140
01:01:41,692 --> 01:01:42,336
Speaker 0: That was awesome.

1141
01:01:42,436 --> 01:01:42,658
Speaker 0: Right.

1142
01:01:42,698 --> 01:01:45,694
Speaker 0: There's, there's parts and this characters that are totally awesome.

1143
01:01:46,056 --> 01:01:47,925
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff that's in here.

1144
01:01:47,965 --> 01:01:49,411
Speaker 0: That's like really great.

1145
01:01:49,612 --> 01:01:57,297
Speaker 0: And like it feel like parts of a great anime, but then that overall picture, right.

1146
01:01:57,437 --> 01:01:58,280
Speaker 0: And, and message.

1147
01:01:58,441 --> 01:02:01,133
Speaker 0: When you look, when you zoom out is like, yeah.

1148
01:02:01,535 --> 01:02:01,716
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1149
01:02:01,756 --> 01:02:06,415
Speaker 1: Like it edges into problematic to a point that I'm kind of mad about.

1150
01:02:06,435 --> 01:02:12,800
Speaker 0: It's like you edited, you edited parts of a great anime movie, you know, to make, uh, an overall picture.

1151
01:02:13,281 --> 01:02:13,903
Speaker 0: that doesn't work.

1152
01:02:14,284 --> 01:02:14,625
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1153
01:02:14,846 --> 01:02:15,107
Speaker 0: Right.

1154
01:02:15,909 --> 01:02:18,457
Speaker 0: So, uh, that's what that is.

1155
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,388
Speaker 0: Like you get to plenty of Shinkai clouds though.

1156
01:02:21,930 --> 01:02:23,718
Speaker 0: Expect more Shinkai soon, I guess.

1157
01:02:23,738 --> 01:02:28,466
Speaker 1: Like if I had a lot of money, he's going to keep making more in terms of the list of movies here that he's known for.

1158
01:02:28,527 --> 01:02:35,074
Speaker 1: Like if I had to rank them, I think, I mean, your name is the best one from every angle I could look at.

1159
01:02:35,114 --> 01:02:35,315
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1160
01:02:35,536 --> 01:02:35,737
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1161
01:02:36,400 --> 01:02:39,319
Speaker 1: I actually think the place promise in our early days is the second best work.

1162
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:39,922
Speaker 0: I agree with that.

1163
01:02:40,605 --> 01:02:44,099
Speaker 1: Uh, and then voices of a distant star and then children.

1164
01:02:44,159 --> 01:02:45,467
Speaker 1: I mean, we reviewed it.

1165
01:02:45,568 --> 01:02:47,983
Speaker 1: You can listen to our old review of children who chase lost voices.

1166
01:02:48,124 --> 01:02:51,119
Speaker 1: It's got, it's deeply because I don't remember anything.

1167
01:02:51,179 --> 01:02:57,003
Speaker 0: So you have to go, you have to go ask Scott who saw the movie recently to get information.

1168
01:02:57,505 --> 01:03:12,487
Speaker 0: Weathering with you reminds me of children who chase lost voices in one very specific way, but that made the thing is whether I disagree or don't or find some parts of weathering with you like distasteful, I can't say it's a bad, boring, no, no, no good movie.

1169
01:03:12,507 --> 01:03:14,333
Speaker 0: Like it's voices.

1170
01:03:14,674 --> 01:03:14,915
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1171
01:03:15,196 --> 01:03:18,553
Speaker 1: But children chase lost voices left me feeling very empty afterward.

1172
01:03:18,573 --> 01:03:21,637
Speaker 1: Like I didn't feel anything about the movie, but I didn't feel anything during the movie.

1173
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:22,584
Speaker 0: I couldn't tell you the name of it.

1174
01:03:22,604 --> 01:03:34,754
Speaker 1: I couldn't even tell you a character, but during the movie, it was almost like an, an inverted, uh, castle in the sky and that it almost portrayed like a broken down Lopita type world.

1175
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:36,400
Speaker 1: Everything's just broken down.

1176
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:39,074
Speaker 0: I was, I was bored and uninterested right here.

1177
01:03:39,134 --> 01:03:39,396
Speaker 0: I was.

1178
01:03:39,436 --> 01:03:44,387
Speaker 1: well, that could be form as function like sky crawlers, which you loved, which is boring on purpose to make you start.

1179
01:03:44,407 --> 01:03:46,481
Speaker 0: That's a different, that's a different kind of boring.

1180
01:03:46,521 --> 01:03:53,504
Speaker 0: That is boring because the tone of sky crawlers or night in the galactic railroad.

1181
01:03:53,625 --> 01:03:53,906
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1182
01:03:53,947 --> 01:04:00,133
Speaker 0: I knew you were going to bring up that on the tone of those is quiet and slow paced consistently.

1183
01:04:00,595 --> 01:04:00,896
Speaker 0: Right.

1184
01:04:00,997 --> 01:04:05,941
Speaker 0: And that's could be boring because you could fall asleep just because it's sort of like a lullaby, right?

1185
01:04:06,142 --> 01:04:13,066
Speaker 0: But you, there's a difference between a good lullaby and a song that is not a lullaby.

1186
01:04:13,327 --> 01:04:15,939
Speaker 0: That's just, you fall asleep, but you're not supposed to.

1187
01:04:16,380 --> 01:04:16,541
Speaker 0: Yup.

1188
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:16,862
Speaker 0: Right.

1189
01:04:17,484 --> 01:04:21,018
Speaker 1: So, but they both left me feeling kind of empty.

1190
01:04:21,078 --> 01:04:25,876
Speaker 1: Like I didn't come out with a strong feeling about any like message or moral.

1191
01:04:26,558 --> 01:04:33,246
Speaker 1: And it also what didn't have that, like the emotional climax was not that strong compared to almost any other movie he's made.

1192
01:04:33,326 --> 01:04:39,994
Speaker 0: Well, if you want to come out feeling right and have a strong climax, I got the movie for you.

1193
01:04:40,015 --> 01:04:41,100
Speaker 0: It's called parasite.

1194
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,498
Speaker 0: You should be able to see it somewhere, hopefully digitally soon.

1195
01:04:44,598 --> 01:04:45,442
Speaker 0: And I'm going to go eat dinner.

1196
01:04:45,643 --> 01:04:45,884
Speaker 0: Yup.

1197
01:04:47,691 --> 01:04:50,262
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

1198
01:04:50,283 --> 01:04:55,147
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 1: Remember geek nights is not one, but four different shows.

1204
01:05:12,836 --> 01:05:19,025
Speaker 0: Geek nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience, but unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1205
01:05:21,293 --> 01:05:24,808
Speaker 1: And the geek nights, Patrion, Patrion's for this episode of geek nights.

1206
01:05:25,190 --> 01:05:31,105
Speaker 1: Uh, the order might be a little bit different than you're used to because they, they made a new patron manager and the internal UI change.

1207
01:05:31,507 --> 01:05:39,550
Speaker 1: So, uh, it looks like it's sorting slightly differently, but it's still roughly in the, it should be in the order of how much you're pledging, but some other stuff changed.

1208
01:05:40,234 --> 01:05:41,844
Speaker 1: Uh, Oh, it doesn't even show me the whole name.

1209
01:05:41,904 --> 01:05:42,367
Speaker 1: God damn it.

1210
01:05:42,649 --> 01:05:43,515
Speaker 1: I got to hover a little bit.

1211
01:05:43,999 --> 01:05:46,620
Speaker 1: Anyway, I will figure out how to make this work better in the future.

1212
01:05:47,101 --> 01:05:52,548
Speaker 1: But for the time being, the Patrion Patrion's are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol, Marty Greenia.

1213
01:05:52,849 --> 01:05:54,880
Speaker 1: Just like a dude, Guy, Shartavishan, Link Ichi.

1214
01:05:55,300 --> 01:05:57,248
Speaker 1: You hold the key to my heart.

1215
01:05:58,172 --> 01:06:00,463
Speaker 1: I got in one little fight and my mom got scared.

1216
01:06:00,946 --> 01:06:21,928
Speaker 1: Clinton Walton, MyStating.com, Jay Bantz, Ren from New Zealand, Ryan Perrin, Drew Openlander, Nicholas Brandau, Chris Midkiff, Mac, The Thirst for Hydrated Ganon, Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Finn, Sean Klein, Thomas Hahn, Shervin Von Horl, and a bunch of other people who chose not to be named or are given like a dollar, which is totally fine.

1217
01:06:21,969 --> 01:06:24,062
Speaker 1: You give a dollar, you get pretty much the same as everyone else.

1218
01:06:24,645 --> 01:06:28,443
Speaker 1: You might've noticed I uploaded something brand new, uh, for the patrons only.

1219
01:06:28,463 --> 01:06:41,808
Speaker 1: The slides slightly zoomed in and weird, but basically it was a YouTube video of us doing an early version of a panel as we're workshopping it well ahead of anything we would ever put on YouTube for regular consumption.

1220
01:06:42,150 --> 01:06:47,634
Speaker 1: There's going to be a lot more content like that, a lot more like behind the scenes, like variant runs.

1221
01:06:47,695 --> 01:06:48,779
Speaker 1: like the other times.

1222
01:06:48,799 --> 01:06:49,846
Speaker 1: we did a panel before.

1223
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:52,001
Speaker 1: we did the one that we thought was good enough to put on YouTube.

1224
01:06:52,483 --> 01:06:55,233
Speaker 1: All that kind of stuff will all be all over the Patreon.

1225
01:06:55,574 --> 01:06:59,658
Speaker 1: But now I leave you with some good life advice.
