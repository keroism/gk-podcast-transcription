1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,608
Speaker 0: It's Monday, March 15th.

2
00:00:11,809 --> 00:00:12,371
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,592 --> 00:00:13,094
Speaker 0: I'm Riff.

4
00:00:13,154 --> 00:00:14,579
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,639 --> 00:00:17,292
Speaker 0: Tonight, whatever happened to programming?

6
00:00:17,312 --> 00:00:18,399
Speaker 0: I don't know.

7
00:00:19,301 --> 00:00:19,747
Speaker 1: You don't know?

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:20,375
Speaker 0: I don't know.

9
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,523
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

10
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:29,980
Speaker 0: So today is a day to beware.

11
00:00:32,622 --> 00:00:35,893
Speaker 1: You kept saying you had some sort of crazy thing to talk about.

12
00:00:35,913 --> 00:00:35,993
Speaker 0: I do.

13
00:00:36,354 --> 00:00:38,020
Speaker 0: And there's a reason you must beware.

14
00:00:38,361 --> 00:00:41,153
Speaker 1: Well, well, well, I point out it's no longer a secret to everyone.

15
00:00:41,635 --> 00:00:42,940
Speaker 0: No, it's not a secret to everyone.

16
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:48,519
Speaker 0: But I don't know when, is the Ides just March 15th, or does it have some hours to it?

17
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:53,674
Speaker 0: Like, you know, is it over at five o'clock or something like that?

18
00:00:53,694 --> 00:00:55,520
Speaker 1: I think Wikipedia can tell you that.

19
00:00:56,061 --> 00:00:57,026
Speaker 0: Oh, that's possibly true.

20
00:00:57,046 --> 00:01:00,882
Speaker 0: But anyway, the Ides are, if not now, recent.

21
00:01:01,766 --> 00:01:04,840
Speaker 0: And they are to be bewared for many reasons.

22
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:09,096
Speaker 1: Can you name any reason other than one guy got stabbed a long time ago?

23
00:01:09,316 --> 00:01:10,678
Speaker 0: I will tell you the reason.

24
00:01:10,959 --> 00:01:11,760
Speaker 1: And it's raining.

25
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:22,560
Speaker 0: So, on Saturday, in a precursor to the Ides, right, the clocks were marched forward, which is a double-edged sword.

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,431
Speaker 1: So I actually had a problem this morning at work with that.

27
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:27,340
Speaker 1: You know, we have, you know, a stock market and everything.

28
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,444
Speaker 1: So we made the time change.

29
00:01:29,147 --> 00:01:30,553
Speaker 1: And we're, you know, we're not stupid.

30
00:01:30,593 --> 00:01:36,580
Speaker 1: We're not like another unnamed company I worked for that shut everything down for an hour every year because they couldn't handle the logs going back in the fall.

31
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,161
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

32
00:01:37,787 --> 00:01:38,494
Speaker 1: So we were fine.

33
00:01:38,555 --> 00:01:48,860
Speaker 1: But monitoring, you know, we have a thing that says, hey, if I don't see a log line from different things that are writing logs within, you know, a few minutes, send an error saying, hey, this thing's not logging.

34
00:01:49,801 --> 00:01:50,966
Speaker 1: They, and this is new monitoring.

35
00:01:51,006 --> 00:01:54,199
Speaker 0: Every single one of them went, oh shit, I haven't seen a log in an hour.

36
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:57,017
Speaker 1: Yep, and then a minute later, they're like, no, everything's fine.

37
00:01:57,037 --> 00:01:57,420
Speaker 1: Never mind.

38
00:01:58,484 --> 00:01:59,500
Speaker 0: It's not that big a problem.

39
00:02:00,442 --> 00:02:00,602
Speaker 0: Yeah.

40
00:02:00,622 --> 00:02:06,440
Speaker 0: So, you know, there was the, this, the, the prelude to the eyes in which the clock moved forward, which is good and bad.

41
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:09,131
Speaker 0: It's good because now the sun is up at the correct time.

42
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:11,059
Speaker 0: It's not dark right now, right?

43
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,234
Speaker 1: I wish we'd just go to daylight savings time and never come back.

44
00:02:14,254 --> 00:02:15,480
Speaker 0: Let's never move the clock back.

45
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:16,809
Speaker 0: Let's just keep it where it is forever.

46
00:02:16,849 --> 00:02:18,279
Speaker 0: That's what I would do if I was in charge.

47
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:19,022
Speaker 1: Well, you know, they did.

48
00:02:19,062 --> 00:02:20,086
Speaker 1: And then it was undone.

49
00:02:20,106 --> 00:02:21,792
Speaker 0: We were that way.

50
00:02:22,012 --> 00:02:22,354
Speaker 0: Yeah.

51
00:02:22,715 --> 00:02:28,820
Speaker 0: But anyway, the, uh, but the problem with it is of course this weekend is an hour shorter.

52
00:02:30,142 --> 00:02:30,443
Speaker 1: Yeah.

53
00:02:30,925 --> 00:02:34,498
Speaker 0: So being an hour shorter, you need to get some more sleeps cause you lost some sleeps.

54
00:02:34,799 --> 00:02:35,040
Speaker 0: Right?

55
00:02:35,381 --> 00:02:36,327
Speaker 1: So when did you go to bed?

56
00:02:36,388 --> 00:02:42,796
Speaker 0: I went to bed pretty early last night, but then at four 30 in the morning, right?

57
00:02:42,816 --> 00:02:43,077
Speaker 0: Right.

58
00:02:44,141 --> 00:02:48,180
Speaker 0: I was awoken by a honking car horn.

59
00:02:48,660 --> 00:03:02,044
Speaker 0: Now at first, at first I thought this car horn was, you know, perhaps some hobo had bumped into a car and set the alarm off, in which case it would stop shortly, you know, but no, it was not a hobo.

60
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:05,019
Speaker 0: So the horn honked a bit more.

61
00:03:06,522 --> 00:03:08,255
Speaker 0: And notice it wasn't honking with a pattern.

62
00:03:08,617 --> 00:03:19,346
Speaker 0: You know, it was literally a human being honking a horn, you know, at, you know, some patterns they just decided and they didn't seem to be moving anywhere.

63
00:03:19,487 --> 00:03:26,980
Speaker 0: It wasn't like they were going down the street honking, like their cucaracha horn, you know, it was someone's pretty much sitting still right nearby honking.

64
00:03:27,861 --> 00:03:30,919
Speaker 0: So eventually I look out the window to see what the fuck.

65
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:40,616
Speaker 0: And I see this car at four 30 in the morning, pulling out of a garage, you know, one of these really tight garages with the car just barely fits.

66
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:42,525
Speaker 1: You know, did you see that video?

67
00:03:42,565 --> 00:03:43,229
Speaker 1: The German guy?

68
00:03:43,249 --> 00:03:43,289
Speaker 1: No.

69
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:46,480
Speaker 1: Oh, I got, I make it make a thing the day later.

70
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,465
Speaker 1: It's the guy who lives.

71
00:03:47,485 --> 00:03:57,457
Speaker 1: his driveway is the narrowest thing in the world to the point that he drives in, opens his car door directly into his house, gets into the house and then rolls the car forward to close the door.

72
00:03:59,621 --> 00:03:59,962
Speaker 0: Whoa.

73
00:04:00,304 --> 00:04:12,319
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so this van, it's like a mini van is trying to get out of this garage and there was a car parked right in front of the garage, but it's not blocking the garage straight up.

74
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:16,380
Speaker 0: It's basically like the car is like, like six inches too far back.

75
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:18,978
Speaker 0: So therefore the mini van can't get out.

76
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,437
Speaker 1: So he's talking to make this jackass move his car so we can get out.

77
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:22,940
Speaker 0: Right.

78
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:31,439
Speaker 0: But he's really, there's no guarantee that that jackass is anywhere within hearing range or will wake up and isn't in like a basement or drunk or who knows what.

79
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,094
Speaker 0: And he, this guy's waking up the whole neighborhood at four 30.

80
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:42,476
Speaker 0: Well, this is why guns need to be legal because I would have just sniped that guy in the mini van from my balcony to his credit at RIT more than once.

81
00:04:43,099 --> 00:04:45,155
Speaker 1: I would, you know, be ready to go to class and I'd pull out.

82
00:04:45,175 --> 00:04:49,579
Speaker 1: Remember in colony, we lived in that cul-de-sac and someone would be parked, double parked in front of my car.

83
00:04:50,762 --> 00:04:56,391
Speaker 1: I would basically just go to my car and hold down the horn and wait, but not at four 30 in the morning.

84
00:04:56,653 --> 00:05:01,905
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it had, I didn't have classes at four 30 in the morning, but had I see, here's the thing, right?

85
00:05:02,307 --> 00:05:07,217
Speaker 0: If just looking at the situation itself, the guy blocking the garage is the jackass.

86
00:05:07,258 --> 00:05:07,520
Speaker 0: Yes.

87
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:10,400
Speaker 0: As soon as this guy starts honking, the horn is the solution.

88
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,735
Speaker 0: He is now also the jackass.

89
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:13,460
Speaker 1: However, what do you do?

90
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,128
Speaker 1: What recompense can he get?

91
00:05:15,149 --> 00:05:17,299
Speaker 0: He could have just called three run one.

92
00:05:18,202 --> 00:05:18,987
Speaker 0: It's New York city.

93
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,840
Speaker 0: It would have been taken care of very easily.

94
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,966
Speaker 1: The dude would have taken a while.

95
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:24,458
Speaker 0: There was a chance the dude would have gotten a ticket.

96
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,647
Speaker 0: It would have done way more damage to that dude and note would have done no damage to the neighbors.

97
00:05:28,767 --> 00:05:30,660
Speaker 0: Now I know that garage.

98
00:05:30,863 --> 00:05:32,160
Speaker 0: See that guy who was parking there.

99
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:37,060
Speaker 0: I'm probably never going to know who that was or see him again, but that garage, I know that guy now, right?

100
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,419
Speaker 0: I know that minivan now because he, that guy lives there.

101
00:05:41,042 --> 00:05:52,922
Speaker 0: So now he is a hated figure in the neighborhood and I know who he is and I'm sure all the other people in my building who are looking out the rear window know who that guy is now and also the building next to that and the building next to that

102
00:05:53,404 --> 00:05:53,787
Speaker 1: to it.

103
00:05:53,867 --> 00:05:56,040
Speaker 1: What if he did not want to harm the jackass?

104
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:59,285
Speaker 1: He simply wanted to, maybe he was in a hurry, something really important.

105
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,030
Speaker 1: He had to catch a plane.

106
00:06:00,170 --> 00:06:00,794
Speaker 0: So, okay.

107
00:06:00,814 --> 00:06:02,524
Speaker 0: So in this case, so what he did?

108
00:06:02,544 --> 00:06:06,579
Speaker 0: instead of, instead of harming, he basically, I don't want to harm the jackass.

109
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,544
Speaker 0: I'll just harm all the neighbors who are innocent neighbors and bring no harm to the jackass at all.

110
00:06:11,564 --> 00:06:13,680
Speaker 1: This man exercised his right to free speech.

111
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,840
Speaker 1: He was basically on the street saying to anyone who wishes to care.

112
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,169
Speaker 0: He actually broke the law of no honking.

113
00:06:18,189 --> 00:06:21,352
Speaker 0: There's a huge find for honking, especially at four thirty in the morning.

114
00:06:21,372 --> 00:06:22,400
Speaker 1: There's no honking zones.

115
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,340
Speaker 1: You got to find out if that's no honking zone or not.

116
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:32,920
Speaker 0: I'm sure four thirty in the morning, I, you know, police, they can come up with an excuse to charge you with anything they could have done, you know, disturbing the peace, whatever, whatever.

117
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,540
Speaker 1: You're always of the mind that what if it was just free speech?

118
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:37,980
Speaker 1: What if he was out spreading the word, the good word?

119
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,579
Speaker 0: He woke me up, therefore he must die.

120
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:48,900
Speaker 0: And the Ides of March shall be upon, I guess they were upon me, but I'll make it so that the next Ides are upon him.

121
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,251
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll change his garage shut on March 15th, 2011.

122
00:06:51,251 --> 00:06:51,593
Speaker 0: Much sadder.

123
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:53,725
Speaker 0: What's he going to do?

124
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:55,217
Speaker 1: But also much more relevant.

125
00:06:55,419 --> 00:07:04,024
Speaker 1: You know, I built a new geek nights computer and I passed off the previous geek nights computer to Emily theoretically to use as a prime computer because it's a really fast computer.

126
00:07:05,331 --> 00:07:06,860
Speaker 1: Eh, USB bus dead.

127
00:07:08,101 --> 00:07:11,578
Speaker 0: How come all the computers remakes broken all the computers of Scott's?

128
00:07:13,643 --> 00:07:15,760
Speaker 1: The computer before this one still worked fine.

129
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:18,493
Speaker 1: I threw it away because it was too old to be used for anything.

130
00:07:19,056 --> 00:07:21,393
Speaker 0: I would like you to prove that that computer would work.

131
00:07:21,534 --> 00:07:22,219
Speaker 0: I do not think so.

132
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:22,440
Speaker 0: It

133
00:07:22,481 --> 00:07:25,615
Speaker 1: was working perfectly when I got rid of it with my faster computer

134
00:07:26,157 --> 00:07:28,870
Speaker 0: and then it sat in the hallway and

135
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:36,112
Speaker 1: might've broke it at some point between when I took it out of the case and left it unprotected in the hallway for many, many weeks tripping over it several times.

136
00:07:36,213 --> 00:07:39,085
Speaker 0: All of my computers, no problems ever.

137
00:07:39,588 --> 00:07:40,270
Speaker 0: Zero.

138
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:48,190
Speaker 1: The thing is I Googled around and the AB nine motherboard, which I'd picked for various reasons back in the day, I picked a shitty motherboard.

139
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:49,700
Speaker 1: A lot of people had trouble with that motherboard.

140
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:50,585
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

141
00:07:50,605 --> 00:07:51,431
Speaker 0: I never pick shit.

142
00:07:51,632 --> 00:07:51,995
Speaker 1: Okay.

143
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:58,070
Speaker 1: Back then though, when I bought it, the ratings were pretty high and all the reviews on new egg were like, yeah, it's a great motherboard and here's all the reasons.

144
00:07:59,198 --> 00:08:03,681
Speaker 1: And in fact, I got the AB nine pro because it was only like $5 more than the regular AB nine.

145
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:03,943
Speaker 0: Yeah.

146
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,880
Speaker 0: The thing is pro doesn't stand for professional on that motherboard.

147
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,274
Speaker 0: It stands for piece of rotten rotten.

148
00:08:10,334 --> 00:08:11,419
Speaker 1: What rotten?

149
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:11,740
Speaker 1: What?

150
00:08:12,421 --> 00:08:12,963
Speaker 1: That's right.

151
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:15,053
Speaker 1: That's right.

152
00:08:15,073 --> 00:08:20,874
Speaker 1: So I, what I'm going to do with it is I'm pretty sure that there's a voltage drop on the USB bus, right?

153
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:25,080
Speaker 1: I actually, for the first time in forever diagnosed a hardware problem.

154
00:08:26,062 --> 00:08:30,760
Speaker 1: So what I'm going to do is either, if I can't fix that problem, it's like a problem in the motherboard.

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,778
Speaker 1: I'm going to turn it into the file server because that thing has 10 status.

156
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:39,539
Speaker 1: I can make it basically a raid and make it the file server for like videos and everything over the files.

157
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:48,703
Speaker 1: But it might be that the power supply that is feeding the USB bus, cause you know, there's different rails and everything, different voltages.

158
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:56,098
Speaker 1: that power supply is a piece of shit that I bought at a store, no name brand to replace the other one that was incompatible with the motherboard in the first place.

159
00:08:57,101 --> 00:08:57,704
Speaker 1: It's possible.

160
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,238
Speaker 1: the power supply is the fault and not the motherboard.

161
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,448
Speaker 0: You know, I don't have these incompatibility problems.

162
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,131
Speaker 1: Yeah.

163
00:09:03,312 --> 00:09:05,966
Speaker 1: Well I bought an AVID AB nine and that was my mistake.

164
00:09:06,026 --> 00:09:08,159
Speaker 1: I should have bought an ACEs with an Intel chip set.

165
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,303
Speaker 0: Like I did.

166
00:09:10,665 --> 00:09:12,833
Speaker 1: You know, my new computer is ACEs.

167
00:09:13,034 --> 00:09:16,128
Speaker 0: Does that AB nine have a, uh, an enforce or something?

168
00:09:16,148 --> 00:09:18,820
Speaker 1: Uh, actually I don't remember or what?

169
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:19,764
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

170
00:09:19,784 --> 00:09:21,753
Speaker 0: It has an ICH8R, right?

171
00:09:21,933 --> 00:09:22,556
Speaker 0: Which is Intel.

172
00:09:22,636 --> 00:09:22,877
Speaker 0: Yes.

173
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:25,792
Speaker 1: However, my new motherboard has the ICH10R.

174
00:09:26,194 --> 00:09:35,293
Speaker 0: I don't know what my computer, my computer, my, the HTPC I just built has the H55, which is very apparently the new hotness.

175
00:09:35,494 --> 00:09:35,736
Speaker 0: Yeah.

176
00:09:35,756 --> 00:09:42,179
Speaker 1: Sadly, you know, I was teaching Emily a bunch of stuff about why I built this computer cause she actually just ordered effectively the same computer I have now.

177
00:09:42,923 --> 00:09:43,871
Speaker 1: It's about $300 cheaper than it was before.

178
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:47,139
Speaker 1: And she doesn't need a video card cause my old video card is fine.

179
00:09:48,202 --> 00:09:49,608
Speaker 1: The 7,900 will play half life too.

180
00:09:49,628 --> 00:09:50,753
Speaker 1: Yeah.

181
00:09:50,793 --> 00:09:51,677
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

182
00:09:52,139 --> 00:10:00,320
Speaker 1: But, uh, you know, the, I was trying to explain like the differences, you know, Northbridge, Southbridge and SAC, CAS latency and everything.

183
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:06,768
Speaker 1: And I realized that about 80% of that stuff is completely irrelevant to anyone making a computer nowadays.

184
00:10:07,029 --> 00:10:07,230
Speaker 0: Yeah.

185
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,140
Speaker 0: Pretty much like one weird thing though.

186
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:13,340
Speaker 0: I do want to point out though, uh, my computer, this on my desk, right?

187
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:17,520
Speaker 0: Which has DR 800 memory, four gigs dual channel, right?

188
00:10:18,341 --> 00:10:31,242
Speaker 0: In the windows, like, you know, the windows performance score thingy, it gets a pretty high score for memories, you know, my new computer, which has four gigs dual channel of DDR, like 1066 memory, right?

189
00:10:31,463 --> 00:10:35,807
Speaker 0: With a, with a, with a, uh, um, I three, right?

190
00:10:35,828 --> 00:10:40,579
Speaker 0: Uh, the memory score in windows is way lower and it's like, why?

191
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:42,569
Speaker 0: It's also a dual channel.

192
00:10:42,649 --> 00:10:43,777
Speaker 0: It's supposed to be faster.

193
00:10:43,857 --> 00:10:44,219
Speaker 0: What's that?

194
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,585
Speaker 1: Triple channel.

195
00:10:45,988 --> 00:10:46,611
Speaker 0: No, not triple.

196
00:10:46,933 --> 00:10:47,678
Speaker 1: I got triple channel.

197
00:10:47,758 --> 00:10:49,288
Speaker 0: I didn't, this is a home theater PC.

198
00:10:49,309 --> 00:10:54,320
Speaker 0: It wasn't a, uh, you know, set the house on fire PC until some future crazy Matroska.

199
00:10:55,983 --> 00:10:56,164
Speaker 0: Yeah.

200
00:10:56,224 --> 00:10:57,534
Speaker 0: But I just thought it was really weird.

201
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:58,118
Speaker 0: I'm like, huh?

202
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:13,980
Speaker 0: And I'm like, I'm sure I could manipulate cause the motherboard is all those overclocking settings, which I just don't touch at all because I don't want to, you know, I'm no interest and I don't want to, I'd rather have a computer that works in as quiet than is 1% faster, but I'm sure I could modify some memory timings to, to fix that situation.

203
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:14,643
Speaker 0: But who cares?

204
00:11:14,663 --> 00:11:15,328
Speaker 0: The computer works.

205
00:11:15,368 --> 00:11:16,637
Speaker 0: I don't need the faster memory.

206
00:11:16,678 --> 00:11:17,000
Speaker 0: It works.

207
00:11:18,485 --> 00:11:19,008
Speaker 0: So all right.

208
00:11:19,793 --> 00:11:20,759
Speaker 1: So you got any news for me?

209
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:31,112
Speaker 1: I do have some news that windows phone seven series, I got to admit, it's real high on my list of maybe when I buy my next phone, I might go that route.

210
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:31,599
Speaker 0: I know.

211
00:11:31,741 --> 00:11:49,560
Speaker 0: It's like you never would have thought you would go for the windows phone seven series and it came out and it looked like I expected it to look, you know, it looks like, you know, all the new Microsoft stuff looks, but they just had big announcements about it today, including the current, the MX at mix 10, which is a Microsoft event, right?

212
00:11:50,902 --> 00:11:58,460
Speaker 0: The one thing it's got right now, you know, that they've showed, that's like no other phones got, that's like, holy shit is fucking Netflix.

213
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:00,565
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

214
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:02,072
Speaker 0: That's a holy shit right there.

215
00:12:02,374 --> 00:12:03,560
Speaker 0: Iphone don't have no Netflix.

216
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:04,610
Speaker 1: Just Netflix streaming.

217
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:05,136
Speaker 0: Yeah.

218
00:12:05,197 --> 00:12:11,364
Speaker 0: You can, you apparently you'll be able to watch streaming Netflix on your windows phone seven series.

219
00:12:11,685 --> 00:12:13,895
Speaker 0: That's that is Android.

220
00:12:13,915 --> 00:12:14,558
Speaker 0: Don't got that.

221
00:12:14,678 --> 00:12:18,457
Speaker 0: Iphone, Iphone has like Netflix app that lets you like, you know, mott fiddle with your queue.

222
00:12:19,804 --> 00:12:21,993
Speaker 0: Free doesn't have that right now.

223
00:12:22,073 --> 00:12:23,860
Speaker 0: And it's like, whoa, windows.

224
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,229
Speaker 0: That is fricking strong.

225
00:12:25,269 --> 00:12:26,559
Speaker 0: Cause it has silver light on it.

226
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:26,740
Speaker 0: Right.

227
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,596
Speaker 0: That's why they were able to do this.

228
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:29,100
Speaker 1: Right.

229
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,537
Speaker 1: Because Netflix uses the silver light DRM.

230
00:12:31,738 --> 00:12:32,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

231
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:36,800
Speaker 0: But it uses some other DRM when you're not using windows, but well, it doesn't work on Linux.

232
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:37,141
Speaker 1: Well,

233
00:12:37,161 --> 00:12:52,060
Speaker 0: you can, I think you can install silver light on Mac actually, but, but yeah, it's like, you know, there, there are some Netflix streaming things that don't have silver light, but silver light is their default with the DRMs and such, but it's, uh, you know, Microsoft also, you know, they brought out this, uh, dev platform.

234
00:12:52,181 --> 00:12:55,240
Speaker 0: You can get today, you know, to start making apps for it and it's free.

235
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,509
Speaker 0: So I'm going to try it out.

236
00:12:56,730 --> 00:12:58,019
Speaker 0: I tried out the Android one too.

237
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:10,962
Speaker 1: I tried out the pre one and I was, it was easy to make apps, but I just have no desire to make an app because I realized the pre is basically being delegated all the way down to like the low end default crappy smartphone OS.

238
00:13:11,022 --> 00:13:11,364
Speaker 1: I think.

239
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:11,866
Speaker 0: Yeah.

240
00:13:11,987 --> 00:13:17,515
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, it's, it's, it's like all the built in stuff on the pre works and is great, but that's all it does.

241
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:20,600
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, it's like they made a bunch of stuff.

242
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:22,900
Speaker 0: That's like the core functionality of a smartphone.

243
00:13:23,283 --> 00:13:28,566
Speaker 0: They polished it up real nice, but then they didn't give you any additional functionalities like say Netflix streaming.

244
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,052
Speaker 1: Yep.

245
00:13:29,498 --> 00:13:33,020
Speaker 1: I mean, it's really sad too because I can't do basic stuff like iPhone and everything.

246
00:13:33,340 --> 00:13:34,368
Speaker 1: There's a Scott trade app.

247
00:13:34,388 --> 00:13:37,991
Speaker 1: Like all this stuff I use, there are apps that just would do it for me.

248
00:13:38,473 --> 00:13:42,433
Speaker 1: And on the pre there's nothing like no reputable company has any app worth a damn.

249
00:13:43,438 --> 00:13:43,780
Speaker 0: Yeah.

250
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,228
Speaker 1: And half the free apps have ads in them.

251
00:13:47,352 --> 00:13:49,662
Speaker 0: There's this whole iPhone apps also have ads.

252
00:13:49,944 --> 00:13:50,366
Speaker 1: Yeah.

253
00:13:50,427 --> 00:13:56,932
Speaker 1: No, this is not a thing that is unique to the Palm, but I'm talking about like the, even like the free apps that basically do nothing.

254
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:58,560
Speaker 1: Like it's just a stopwatch.

255
00:13:58,902 --> 00:14:03,771
Speaker 1: You can pay five bucks for the stopwatch or it's free, but it has ads in it and it doesn't even work.

256
00:14:04,315 --> 00:14:12,160
Speaker 0: You know, I'm really like, I can't figure out like why they failed because it's like they had a great, the smartphone did a lot of stuff that no one else still is not doing right.

257
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:15,260
Speaker 0: The I amming, you know, unified the email unified.

258
00:14:15,441 --> 00:14:17,170
Speaker 0: They're doing a lot of stuff that is just better.

259
00:14:17,532 --> 00:14:18,920
Speaker 0: The UI is pretty great.

260
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:28,546
Speaker 1: You think the Google phone would have the Android universal search, but no, the pre, if you just start typing, it is the smartest thing in the world and figuring out what you want to do with whatever you're typing.

261
00:14:28,788 --> 00:14:28,909
Speaker 0: Yeah.

262
00:14:28,929 --> 00:14:35,460
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, all the phones have that, but the pre, I think I'm talking about the things that pre has, that no one else has, but nobody video.

263
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:44,379
Speaker 1: I got to find if someone basically had a screen of like three smartphones and he types the same characters into each one, one by one and shows you how they're all reacting in real time.

264
00:14:45,082 --> 00:14:47,717
Speaker 1: The pre it reacts faster and picks better.

265
00:14:47,737 --> 00:14:48,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

266
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:54,288
Speaker 0: It also the camera is so fast compared to the other phones and they added video support to the camera that works just great.

267
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:54,831
Speaker 0: Yeah.

268
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:57,263
Speaker 0: Well the iPhone three GS has video.

269
00:14:57,324 --> 00:14:59,660
Speaker 1: No, I'm saying the pre didn't until just recently.

270
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,463
Speaker 1: That was like.

271
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:05,938
Speaker 1: one of the biggest problems with the pre is that you couldn't record video and then one day a random update appeared and it added it.

272
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:06,299
Speaker 1: Yeah.

273
00:15:06,821 --> 00:15:12,327
Speaker 0: But it's like they have all this stuff, but it just like, I think it's just marketing or something that just, they can't get people on it.

274
00:15:12,528 --> 00:15:22,068
Speaker 1: You know, the other thing that bothers me is that the pre, I think at least the Palm pre that I'm using now has the best physical design of all the existing smartphones.

275
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,494
Speaker 0: I don't know.

276
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:24,800
Speaker 0: The nexus one is pretty hot.

277
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,122
Speaker 0: Yeah.

278
00:15:25,162 --> 00:15:27,820
Speaker 1: But I like the fact that the pre has this tiny form factor.

279
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,549
Speaker 1: It's really an itty bitty little phone.

280
00:15:29,649 --> 00:15:30,152
Speaker 1: Yeah.

281
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:35,280
Speaker 0: It's also, you know, the, but the, the pre does have the keyboard, which the other people do not have.

282
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:35,541
Speaker 1: Yes.

283
00:15:35,561 --> 00:15:36,789
Speaker 1: It is the keyboard that I like.

284
00:15:36,830 --> 00:15:39,085
Speaker 1: the fact that it's a vertical keyboard and not a horizontal.

285
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:41,240
Speaker 0: It's probably the best one with a physical keyboard.

286
00:15:41,902 --> 00:15:42,487
Speaker 0: I would say that.

287
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,555
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're right.

288
00:15:43,575 --> 00:15:44,220
Speaker 1: I should clarify.

289
00:15:44,501 --> 00:15:48,067
Speaker 0: If you have a physical keyboard, it's like if you want a physical keyboard, that's the best one.

290
00:15:48,269 --> 00:15:48,531
Speaker 0: You know?

291
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:51,940
Speaker 0: But the thing is, I think the problem is even though it has a physical keyboard, right?

292
00:15:51,980 --> 00:16:01,100
Speaker 0: It seems to me like the people who want a physical keyboard, right, are, you know, there's, there is people who they like write hold big emails on their thing.

293
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:03,978
Speaker 0: In which case that keyboard doesn't really good for that, you know?

294
00:16:03,998 --> 00:16:04,179
Speaker 0: Yeah.

295
00:16:04,441 --> 00:16:09,880
Speaker 1: But I mean like what I do, my typical use is responding to basically gig nights, PR crap.

296
00:16:09,961 --> 00:16:11,380
Speaker 1: Like I have to respond to people pretty quickly.

297
00:16:11,501 --> 00:16:14,159
Speaker 1: So I send fairly long emails from it on a regular basis.

298
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:21,279
Speaker 0: The thing that really bothers me is not so much whether the, you know, I thought I really wanted a physical keyboard, but the thing is I never type anything really long.

299
00:16:21,782 --> 00:16:25,480
Speaker 0: The thing that bothers me the most is simply an unresponsive keyboard.

300
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:35,097
Speaker 0: You know, it's like I want, I want, you know, on a phone, it's, why don't people program that, you know, every computer that has a user interface should be programmed in the following way.

301
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,700
Speaker 0: The following way is user input takes precedence over all other processing.

302
00:16:39,824 --> 00:16:48,820
Speaker 0: If you're, my computer is encoding a video and decoding a video and playing a 3d game and I move the mouse, all of those processes should be paused.

303
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,560
Speaker 0: Zero instructions executed.

304
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:56,486
Speaker 0: If I need the CPU power to move the mouse arrow around the screen because the CPU is 100%.

305
00:16:56,486 --> 00:16:59,920
Speaker 0: if I start typing something in a box in a web browser, right?

306
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:06,608
Speaker 0: In a text box and all like a hundred I'm computing like pie out to the billions digit and the CPU is locked up.

307
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,640
Speaker 0: It should just stop completely.

308
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:10,648
Speaker 0: Stop figuring out the next digit of pie.

309
00:17:11,512 --> 00:17:13,079
Speaker 0: Give no instructions to that.

310
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,700
Speaker 0: No CPU cycles to that process whatsoever.

311
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:27,339
Speaker 0: If that makes it so that my typing in the box is 100% responsive and all phones, all desktop user interfaces, every desktop user application should be programmed in this way.

312
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:32,533
Speaker 0: User input always comes first, whatever I'm doing and everything else takes a backseat.

313
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:33,798
Speaker 0: Zero priority.

314
00:17:33,899 --> 00:17:34,120
Speaker 0: Nice.

315
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,426
Speaker 0: Minus a thousand.

316
00:17:35,466 --> 00:17:36,009
Speaker 0: I don't care.

317
00:17:36,029 --> 00:17:36,331
Speaker 0: Right?

318
00:17:36,632 --> 00:17:38,100
Speaker 0: And this is how phones need to be.

319
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,247
Speaker 0: Even the iPhone.

320
00:17:39,328 --> 00:17:40,174
Speaker 0: Oh, it's so beautiful.

321
00:17:40,235 --> 00:17:40,920
Speaker 0: Oh, it's so perfect.

322
00:17:41,341 --> 00:17:54,580
Speaker 0: I go to like NOAA.gov and I try to type in my zip code to check the weather and I push one and I have to wait like two seconds before it actually enters the one into the text box because it's busy processing some JavaScript on NOAA.gov.

323
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,087
Speaker 0: Pause the JavaScript.

324
00:17:56,107 --> 00:17:56,509
Speaker 0: Just zero.

325
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:57,314
Speaker 0: No, I don't care.

326
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:58,220
Speaker 0: I am typing here.

327
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,304
Speaker 0: Typing comes first.

328
00:17:59,365 --> 00:18:00,471
Speaker 0: Everything else comes last.

329
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:01,195
Speaker 0: Right?

330
00:18:01,517 --> 00:18:04,912
Speaker 0: Pro, you know, there is no reason that computers can't be this way.

331
00:18:05,756 --> 00:18:05,937
Speaker 0: What?

332
00:18:05,997 --> 00:18:06,560
Speaker 0: No one does it.

333
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:07,123
Speaker 0: Right?

334
00:18:07,163 --> 00:18:13,959
Speaker 0: I mean the Linux kernel added the preemptible kernel option, but even so still sometimes you're not preempting when you should be preempting.

335
00:18:14,382 --> 00:18:15,740
Speaker 0: So fucking get it right.

336
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:22,160
Speaker 0: If you could actually make a user interface always number one priority, I wouldn't care about a software keyboard.

337
00:18:22,381 --> 00:18:24,254
Speaker 1: So here's something really interesting that the PRI did.

338
00:18:24,295 --> 00:18:33,080
Speaker 1: They had an update, you know, recently the one that added the camera functionality and there was a note in the bottom about some weird UI update and I read into it a little bit.

339
00:18:33,420 --> 00:18:38,207
Speaker 1: Apparently people had complained that web OS was unresponsive and they made changes.

340
00:18:38,247 --> 00:18:42,820
Speaker 1: But as far as I can tell, they didn't actually in any way make it respond faster.

341
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:46,500
Speaker 1: All they did was make it appear to respond faster.

342
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:51,943
Speaker 1: Like they made icons load immediately even before like the frame inside of it loaded.

343
00:18:52,527 --> 00:18:56,399
Speaker 1: So it felt like it was a lot more responsive, but it didn't actually speed it up or anything as far as I can tell.

344
00:18:57,322 --> 00:18:59,000
Speaker 1: And that seems to have allayed all the complaints.

345
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:14,580
Speaker 1: I think the best philosophy for this sort of thing is that if you can't actually get the OS to respond to something, cause you might have a legitimate situation where you can't respond to user input or you can't make like icons load as fast as you should.

346
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:18,258
Speaker 0: As far as I'm concerned, if that happens, then that's a bug, you know, but that's just me.

347
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,213
Speaker 1: But what you should do is at least fake it.

348
00:19:20,899 --> 00:19:22,260
Speaker 1: Actually, we have a projector at work though.

349
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:34,408
Speaker 1: This confuses people often where before when you plug it into a computer, it shows a windows desktop on the display immediately based on the last windows desktop that it had displayed.

350
00:19:35,292 --> 00:19:36,740
Speaker 1: So it looks like it's there right away.

351
00:19:37,282 --> 00:19:45,031
Speaker 1: Of course, if you actually try to move something, you realize it's just a screenshot and we, we basically have a game of how long does it take for the vendor to figure this out.

352
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:48,892
Speaker 0: Oh, the people coming to sell you stuff.

353
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:49,638
Speaker 1: Yeah.

354
00:19:49,678 --> 00:19:49,880
Speaker 1: Yeah.

355
00:19:50,121 --> 00:19:51,240
Speaker 1: I had a couple of meetings with them today.

356
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,960
Speaker 1: That's why I wore the black blazer as opposed to my gray blazer.

357
00:19:54,422 --> 00:19:56,259
Speaker 0: Because you have to look good for someone to sell you stuff.

358
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,112
Speaker 0: You're not selling, you're being sold too.

359
00:19:58,133 --> 00:19:59,100
Speaker 0: You should dress like a schmuck.

360
00:19:59,962 --> 00:20:00,263
Speaker 0: Yeah.

361
00:20:00,323 --> 00:20:00,705
Speaker 0: Come on.

362
00:20:00,765 --> 00:20:01,348
Speaker 0: What do you got?

363
00:20:01,529 --> 00:20:03,980
Speaker 0: You were selling, then you dress up nice.

364
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,729
Speaker 0: Like please buy my thing, please.

365
00:20:05,950 --> 00:20:06,995
Speaker 1: Here's some strategy.

366
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:11,100
Speaker 1: So, you know, three of us go to this meeting, I dress up like this and I don't talk.

367
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:14,860
Speaker 1: I just sit there and watch everyone else grill the sales guy.

368
00:20:15,262 --> 00:20:19,200
Speaker 1: And I just sit there looking kind of very disapproving with a clipboard and I'm writing out, I was just doodling.

369
00:20:20,461 --> 00:20:26,578
Speaker 1: And then I asked like one question at the end and the guy was basically scared shitless of me as far as I could tell.

370
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,591
Speaker 1: So you got to play these things out.

371
00:20:29,611 --> 00:20:33,460
Speaker 1: And basically my question was, so how much does this actually cost?

372
00:20:33,923 --> 00:20:43,355
Speaker 0: So there's someone's, you always pick one person in the meeting whose job is to act for the price, act like the person who's actually making the decision who does not want whatever it is.

373
00:20:43,621 --> 00:20:51,768
Speaker 0: And then ask for the prices and everyone else has all the other non price questions or ask like the serious question like, so what do you mean?

374
00:20:51,808 --> 00:20:53,980
Speaker 1: this doesn't support sending S and MP traps?

375
00:20:54,081 --> 00:20:55,188
Speaker 1: It's a monitoring suite.

376
00:20:56,758 --> 00:20:57,040
Speaker 0: Okay.

377
00:20:58,282 --> 00:21:09,067
Speaker 1: So I don't want to talk about all the whole history of this, but as you all know, there's been this long stupid history of the EU and the antitrust side of lawsuits with Microsoft.

378
00:21:09,751 --> 00:21:12,580
Speaker 1: And they came to the conclusion that, how are we going to get Microsoft?

379
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:24,500
Speaker 1: We're going to force them to either not include IE, which is a stupid idea in windows or to include some various list of competitors to IE in windows.

380
00:21:25,262 --> 00:21:35,585
Speaker 1: And I think this is like the biggest example I've ever seen in technological history of completely missing the forest for the trees of completely saying, here's a problem.

381
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:48,368
Speaker 1: The, you know, the Microsoft monopoly, we were going to solve it by picking the stupidest possible aspect of the problem and then having the stupidest possible solution to that problem, thereby solving everything.

382
00:21:49,392 --> 00:21:50,095
Speaker 0: So yeah.

383
00:21:50,477 --> 00:21:58,071
Speaker 1: All right, Microsoft, you have to put all the competitors, web browsers in your OS or, Oh, you shouldn't include a web browser.

384
00:21:58,733 --> 00:22:00,741
Speaker 1: So say Microsoft did the, all right, fine.

385
00:22:00,781 --> 00:22:01,585
Speaker 1: No web browser.

386
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,400
Speaker 1: How are these people going to download Firefox?

387
00:22:05,764 --> 00:22:06,580
Speaker 0: Well, they gave you this.

388
00:22:06,861 --> 00:22:07,689
Speaker 0: That's the thing they did.

389
00:22:07,749 --> 00:22:11,200
Speaker 0: is when you turn the computer on, it makes you choose a web browser that it will then install.

390
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:15,260
Speaker 1: So Microsoft in their infinite wisdom decided, and I think this is brilliant.

391
00:22:15,502 --> 00:22:24,940
Speaker 1: All right, we're just going to pick the top seven web browsers in the EU based on some dubious metrics, whatever they are, you got to pick one of them.

392
00:22:25,442 --> 00:22:29,458
Speaker 1: And the story here is that there are some weird freaking browsers.

393
00:22:29,499 --> 00:22:30,929
Speaker 1: There's no, no one's heard of in here.

394
00:22:30,969 --> 00:22:37,345
Speaker 1: And as far as I can tell, they're all basically either I E with a different interface or Firefox with a different interface.

395
00:22:37,969 --> 00:22:38,271
Speaker 0: Yeah.

396
00:22:38,371 --> 00:22:49,024
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, the thing is when you, when you load up this, you know, European windows seven, right, it lets you choose between, you know, Firefox, I E Chrome opera and Safari, right?

397
00:22:49,084 --> 00:22:50,110
Speaker 0: It says here, pick one.

398
00:22:50,391 --> 00:22:51,940
Speaker 0: And they're in a different order each time.

399
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:56,360
Speaker 0: But the randomness of that is actually, it was supposed to be random, but whoever coded it did it wrong.

400
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:59,317
Speaker 0: It's like Chrome is more likely to appear in the somethings.

401
00:22:59,337 --> 00:22:59,700
Speaker 0: I forget.

402
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:07,811
Speaker 0: There's an article about it, but you can click more browsers and it'll give you like seven more choices of weird browsers that almost no one uses.

403
00:23:07,871 --> 00:23:08,112
Speaker 0: Yes.

404
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:13,332
Speaker 1: Like green browser, which I'm going to quote this article from pcpro.uk.

405
00:23:13,974 --> 00:23:18,539
Speaker 1: green browser is your best choice of flexible and powerful green web browser.

406
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:20,021
Speaker 1: Yeah.

407
00:23:20,061 --> 00:23:23,377
Speaker 1: Meaning essentially internet explorer bash with an ugly stick.

408
00:23:23,819 --> 00:23:23,980
Speaker 0: Yep.

409
00:23:25,380 --> 00:23:26,828
Speaker 0: And I don't know.

410
00:23:26,888 --> 00:23:35,266
Speaker 0: pretty much all the browsers that are in the, you know, more browsers section are either Firefox or internet explore that are sort of mashed up.

411
00:23:35,306 --> 00:23:43,670
Speaker 0: Like flock is a, is a is basically Firefox that's modified to have like all sorts of flicker and blogging integrated stuff.

412
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:45,460
Speaker 0: It's basically Firefox with a bunch of extension.

413
00:23:45,741 --> 00:23:49,518
Speaker 1: Or a little bit of Polish schlepner gets the bonus points for good name.

414
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:49,900
Speaker 1: Yeah.

415
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:51,046
Speaker 1: But all it really is.

416
00:23:51,067 --> 00:23:53,300
Speaker 1: Oh, here's, here's the relevant quote from the article.

417
00:23:53,823 --> 00:23:54,933
Speaker 1: It's no racehorse.

418
00:23:55,479 --> 00:23:55,640
Speaker 0: Yeah.

419
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,918
Speaker 0: I think there's another one that has, it lets you switch between Firefox and IE schlepner.

420
00:24:00,079 --> 00:24:00,240
Speaker 0: Yeah.

421
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:04,641
Speaker 0: It comes with like the, you know, IE tab extension pretty much integrated into it.

422
00:24:04,822 --> 00:24:06,977
Speaker 1: And it's like, how stupid is the EU?

423
00:24:07,057 --> 00:24:14,980
Speaker 1: You know, all this fighting about Microsoft and their monopoly and whatever, and they decide to force them to install competitors product.

424
00:24:15,322 --> 00:24:18,620
Speaker 1: What if you sell a Ford car and they're like, well, let's say Ford made tires.

425
00:24:18,820 --> 00:24:23,258
Speaker 1: Well you have to give people the option of having Mazda tires and those tires.

426
00:24:24,601 --> 00:24:31,522
Speaker 0: It should be more like if Ford made tires and they said, no, you have to let people choose between Goodyear and Bridgestone and something, something.

427
00:24:31,864 --> 00:24:32,065
Speaker 1: Yeah.

428
00:24:32,125 --> 00:24:36,971
Speaker 1: But our radio, say Ford makes their, you know, the default radio that they contract out, whatever.

429
00:24:36,991 --> 00:24:38,840
Speaker 1: And that's just in the car.

430
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:41,152
Speaker 1: You know, buy a Ford car, you get the Ford radio.

431
00:24:41,474 --> 00:24:43,568
Speaker 1: And if they said, Oh no, that's anti competition.

432
00:24:43,588 --> 00:24:49,568
Speaker 1: You have to include these eight other radios, half of which either don't work or don't fit in the computer in the, in the car in the first place.

433
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:54,480
Speaker 1: It's just, this is the sad conclusion of this whole Epic story.

434
00:24:54,800 --> 00:25:08,585
Speaker 1: And it's such a whimper, but I just, I foresee crazy problems going forward as people use these other weird web browsers and have, you know, there's going to be some sort of breach of IE and it's going to turn out that it's not a breach of IE.

435
00:25:08,605 --> 00:25:14,967
Speaker 1: It's a breach of one of these crappy web browsers that, I don't know, one third of people picked because it happened to be at the top when they pick web browsers.

436
00:25:15,229 --> 00:25:22,260
Speaker 0: Well, another thing is in order to, I think almost no one is going to pick one of those crappy ones because you have to click like, show me more to see any of those.

437
00:25:22,581 --> 00:25:26,220
Speaker 0: Most people are going to click IE, Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or opera.

438
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:34,699
Speaker 0: Cause those are the only ones that show up in your face and you're just going to pick one of them and you're not going to click on the tiny thing that says, show me more that then going to show you the crappy ones.

439
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,180
Speaker 1: I feel like the real solution.

440
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:39,296
Speaker 0: So I think it'd be like less than one fraction of 1% uses something else.

441
00:25:40,281 --> 00:25:49,674
Speaker 1: The real solution was to let Microsoft include IE and not bother with the browser war at all and focus on some other, more fundamental aspect of this whole antitrust thing.

442
00:25:49,875 --> 00:25:50,076
Speaker 0: Yeah.

443
00:25:50,096 --> 00:25:57,197
Speaker 0: How about, you know, focus on some Apple antitrust like, Hey, how come, you know, you can't sync your iPod with anything but iTunes?

444
00:25:57,257 --> 00:26:03,754
Speaker 0: and Hey, how come iTunes won't sync with anything but an iPod and doesn't have a commanding market share of computers?

445
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:06,070
Speaker 0: They do with, I'm talking about iPods here.

446
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,380
Speaker 0: I'm not talking about the computer Mac.

447
00:26:07,541 --> 00:26:08,832
Speaker 0: Did I mention the Mac?

448
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:09,860
Speaker 0: I mentioned the iPod.

449
00:26:10,582 --> 00:26:15,506
Speaker 1: This was to address the fact that Microsoft has the majority of the computer market for consumers.

450
00:26:15,606 --> 00:26:23,783
Speaker 0: Oh, you know how you could fix that force, uh, force companies that make software for windows only to make it for every cross platform.

451
00:26:23,964 --> 00:26:25,653
Speaker 1: So, all right, this is the problem.

452
00:26:25,673 --> 00:26:26,940
Speaker 1: The EU also has very little power.

453
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:33,008
Speaker 1: Microsoft basically in addressing these EU complaints was saying, all right, we'll play by your silly.

454
00:26:33,069 --> 00:26:34,215
Speaker 0: Yeah, do whatever we don't care.

455
00:26:34,276 --> 00:26:35,020
Speaker 0: Just go away.

456
00:26:35,121 --> 00:26:36,352
Speaker 0: We'll do whatever silly thing you want.

457
00:26:36,372 --> 00:26:39,700
Speaker 1: And really the EU, they screwed up and that they let Microsoft get away.

458
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,320
Speaker 1: They didn't actually get Microsoft.

459
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,497
Speaker 1: I don't believe Microsoft should have been gotten in the first place.

460
00:26:43,618 --> 00:26:43,739
Speaker 1: Yeah.

461
00:26:43,961 --> 00:26:47,280
Speaker 1: But all they did was force Microsoft to play by some arbitrary rule.

462
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:49,396
Speaker 1: That's not going to affect anyone majorly in the long run.

463
00:26:49,416 --> 00:26:50,484
Speaker 1: And Microsoft said, all right, fine.

464
00:26:50,806 --> 00:26:51,754
Speaker 1: We did your stupid thing.

465
00:26:51,855 --> 00:26:52,379
Speaker 1: Are we done now?

466
00:26:52,641 --> 00:26:55,680
Speaker 0: It's pretty much just a stupid, you know, Europe versus us thing.

467
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:11,231
Speaker 0: Basically Europe is finding that, you know, any us companies, right, that are so big and international that they need to do bit that they have a lot of business in Europe that the EU can basically extract money from the U S by regulating these U S corporations.

468
00:27:11,272 --> 00:27:13,120
Speaker 0: that happened to do a lot of business in Europe.

469
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:21,260
Speaker 1: Look at how many times like say Germany is a big offender of this because they'll always try to hit some American companies saying, Hey, you showed some Nazi stuff that's against our law.

470
00:27:21,441 --> 00:27:24,174
Speaker 1: And luckily most American companies say, okay, whatever.

471
00:27:24,194 --> 00:27:24,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, sure.

472
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:25,340
Speaker 1: Yeah.

473
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,123
Speaker 1: Germany,

474
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:54,140
Speaker 0: you know, like if they, you know, they didn't like Nintendo, you know, they could, uh, you know, go after, you know, Nintendo of Europe or whatever, even though it's a Japanese company, you know, it's like, you know, if the, if the U S was upset, they could do the same thing to Japan, you know, via, you know, Toyota or any other sort of, you know, Japanese company that's operating in the U S. So it's basically just a way to disturb the economies and pester other countries by pestering companies that happen to do international business.

475
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:55,900
Speaker 0: So whatever.

476
00:27:56,280 --> 00:28:01,095
Speaker 1: It's just this whole situation really just, it's nothing more than nothing.

477
00:28:01,619 --> 00:28:01,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

478
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day, stuff like this does not happen nearly as often as it showed anymore.

479
00:28:17,043 --> 00:28:25,700
Speaker 1: And I th this has such an anonymous slash 4chan slash V vibe to it, especially if you look at this video or you look at these screenshots.

480
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:33,092
Speaker 1: So I don't know how many of you are familiar with the max headroom broadcast signal intrusion incident of 1987 max headroom.

481
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:37,872
Speaker 1: Are you familiar with max headroom?

482
00:28:38,214 --> 00:28:38,515
Speaker 0: Maybe.

483
00:28:38,917 --> 00:28:39,198
Speaker 1: Are you?

484
00:28:39,238 --> 00:28:39,359
Speaker 1: Yeah.

485
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:40,164
Speaker 1: Are you really?

486
00:28:40,387 --> 00:28:40,528
Speaker 1: Yeah.

487
00:28:41,135 --> 00:28:41,358
Speaker 1: Okay.

488
00:28:41,398 --> 00:28:52,062
Speaker 1: Anyway, so max headroom interrupted television in Chicago, Illinois, like real broadcast television on November 22nd, 1987.

489
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:55,175
Speaker 1: So I'm just going to read from this Wikipedia article.

490
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:56,716
Speaker 1: that basically sums the whole thing up.

491
00:28:57,342 --> 00:29:04,619
Speaker 1: This is like the bad-ass kind of futurism cyberpunk, you know, intercepting the broadcast and sending your own messages out.

492
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:13,040
Speaker 1: But it's so random and 4chan-y and weird that I don't know, it's surreal.

493
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:16,759
Speaker 1: It's surreal and cool in a way that very few pranks have ever managed to be.

494
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:23,044
Speaker 1: So the first occurrence of the signal intrusion took place during a WGN TV channel.

495
00:29:23,064 --> 00:29:25,620
Speaker 1: nine live telecast of some prime time news show.

496
00:29:26,481 --> 00:29:29,915
Speaker 1: So the news shows on and then suddenly quote the station.

497
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:41,239
Speaker 1: signal was interrupted for about half a minute by a video of a person wearing a max headroom mask standing in front of a swing sheet of corrugated metal, which imitated imitated the background effect in max headroom.

498
00:29:42,243 --> 00:29:44,599
Speaker 1: There was no audio, just a buzzing noise.

499
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:56,292
Speaker 1: The hijack was stopped after 30 seconds or so when an engineer at WGN changed the modulation of their studio link to the John Hancock center transmitter blocking this interception transmission.

500
00:29:57,136 --> 00:29:57,920
Speaker 1: So think about that.

501
00:29:58,303 --> 00:30:05,442
Speaker 1: In the eighties, someone managed somehow to override real broadcast TV with his own broadcast TV.

502
00:30:05,724 --> 00:30:06,146
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

503
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:13,579
Speaker 1: So later that night at 1115 PM, this is where it gets interesting during doctor who it was on TV.

504
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:26,080
Speaker 1: The signal was hijacked using the same video that was broadcast during the WGN hijack, but this time with distorted audio, the person in the max headroom mask appeared as before, and this time he was saying that does it.

505
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,335
Speaker 1: He's a freaking nerd for laughing and jeering.

506
00:30:28,758 --> 00:30:32,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I'm better than Chuck Swirsky, freaking liberal.

507
00:30:34,182 --> 00:30:45,579
Speaker 1: He goes on to do strange things while periodically saying strange things like catch the way while holding a Pepsi can and he just gets more and more and more bizarre from there.

508
00:30:45,821 --> 00:30:57,391
Speaker 1: Some other person appears and this kind of happened and stopped and to this day no one has ever solved how they did it, who it was, why they did it, what they're trying to accomplish.

509
00:30:57,895 --> 00:31:00,710
Speaker 1: And the person, no one ever claimed credit for it as far as I can tell.

510
00:31:01,474 --> 00:31:02,258
Speaker 1: And that's the end of it.

511
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:05,213
Speaker 0: You want to, you want to, do you know about the Heidi game?

512
00:31:05,233 --> 00:31:06,280
Speaker 1: The Heidi game?

513
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:07,044
Speaker 1: Yeah, not.

514
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:10,020
Speaker 0: So in the year of, let me read the Wikipedia.

515
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,889
Speaker 0: I forget what year it was.

516
00:31:11,889 --> 00:31:15,127
Speaker 0: 1968 there was a football game between the New York Jets and the Oakland Raiders.

517
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:15,851
Speaker 0: All right.

518
00:31:16,554 --> 00:31:19,671
Speaker 0: And this game was like, this was like a huge game, right?

519
00:31:19,993 --> 00:31:24,400
Speaker 0: Like gigantic, you know, the Raiders were the AFL champions in the previous year, right?

520
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:29,145
Speaker 0: These teams both had seven and two records going into this game and the game was back and forth.

521
00:31:29,225 --> 00:31:30,855
Speaker 0: It was a competitive, great football game.

522
00:31:30,895 --> 00:31:31,418
Speaker 0: Holy shit.

523
00:31:31,498 --> 00:31:31,720
Speaker 0: Right.

524
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:44,800
Speaker 0: And seven o'clock came around and at seven o'clock there was a movie Heidi sponsored by Timex that was supposed to go on at seven o'clock, but it was still like the third quarter of this crazy game.

525
00:31:45,481 --> 00:31:49,660
Speaker 0: So they had instructions to switch to Heidi at seven o'clock, no matter what.

526
00:31:50,944 --> 00:31:55,140
Speaker 1: Ooh, I remember as a kid being mad, every time the Simpsons was supposed to start, but stupid football.

527
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:58,800
Speaker 0: And now the thing is people started calling in as it got close to seven.

528
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,780
Speaker 0: Some people were saying, are you going to cut the game off?

529
00:32:01,861 --> 00:32:02,869
Speaker 0: Is the game going to keep going?

530
00:32:02,889 --> 00:32:05,233
Speaker 0: And some people were calling in to say, is Heidi going to go on?

531
00:32:05,497 --> 00:32:05,760
Speaker 0: Right?

532
00:32:06,441 --> 00:32:11,080
Speaker 0: The network was trying to call the stations to tell them to not put Heidi on.

533
00:32:12,382 --> 00:32:12,704
Speaker 0: Right.

534
00:32:12,744 --> 00:32:14,920
Speaker 0: To change the instruction, but they couldn't get through.

535
00:32:15,481 --> 00:32:18,980
Speaker 0: And Heidi went on and it was the famous Heidi game.

536
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:25,480
Speaker 0: And you can get the rest of the chat, the details on the Wikipedia's and such, but this is a famous, famous television interruption.

537
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:30,559
Speaker 0: When Heidi went on in the middle of the football game and barely anyone saw the rest of the football game,

538
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:34,413
Speaker 1: but that was not a guy in a max headroom mask

539
00:32:34,473 --> 00:32:34,915
Speaker 0: breaking

540
00:32:35,076 --> 00:32:36,059
Speaker 1: into real TV,

541
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:44,317
Speaker 0: but it was incredibly, you know, when Heidi went on the phone calls went, Holy shit.

542
00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:50,556
Speaker 0: And it's the reason that they realized football was popular because Nielsen ratings, that's just bullshit.

543
00:32:50,597 --> 00:32:50,799
Speaker 0: Right?

544
00:32:51,142 --> 00:32:57,056
Speaker 0: But the Heidi game by putting Heidi in the middle of the football, they were like, Oh shit, the football is popular.

545
00:32:57,518 --> 00:32:57,760
Speaker 0: Right?

546
00:32:58,020 --> 00:32:59,146
Speaker 0: That's when they realized.

547
00:33:00,191 --> 00:33:05,934
Speaker 0: So anyway, my thing of the day, we've been singing Trilla, a little bit today, a little bit.

548
00:33:07,982 --> 00:33:10,031
Speaker 0: Do you know Rick Astley?

549
00:33:10,051 --> 00:33:10,794
Speaker 1: I may have heard of him.

550
00:33:10,975 --> 00:33:11,557
Speaker 0: Rick Astley.

551
00:33:11,597 --> 00:33:11,818
Speaker 0: Yeah.

552
00:33:11,838 --> 00:33:12,663
Speaker 0: Some guy, right?

553
00:33:12,683 --> 00:33:12,864
Speaker 0: Yeah.

554
00:33:13,106 --> 00:33:16,948
Speaker 0: And you know, he's kind of cool because when everyone started, Rick rolling, he never gave up.

555
00:33:17,189 --> 00:33:19,660
Speaker 0: He, he knew that Rick rolling was, was awesome.

556
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,323
Speaker 0: He got it.

557
00:33:20,564 --> 00:33:21,349
Speaker 0: He was in on it.

558
00:33:21,530 --> 00:33:22,395
Speaker 0: He knew what was up.

559
00:33:22,555 --> 00:33:22,757
Speaker 1: Yup.

560
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:24,318
Speaker 0: You know, he went along with it.

561
00:33:24,661 --> 00:33:31,309
Speaker 1: I have a feeling if you approached him and said, I would like to pay your appearance fee simply to Rick roll someone, he would say, all right, he's a gladly.

562
00:33:31,651 --> 00:33:32,776
Speaker 0: I'd be more than happy to.

563
00:33:33,359 --> 00:33:34,262
Speaker 0: Well, mr.

564
00:33:34,362 --> 00:33:39,420
Speaker 0: Tralala law, Edward Kiel is alive and well.

565
00:33:42,283 --> 00:33:43,228
Speaker 1: So does he speak English?

566
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:44,132
Speaker 0: No.

567
00:33:44,473 --> 00:33:55,549
Speaker 1: Cause I would say if there was, somehow if he like lived in America now or for whatever reason, I would be willing to pay to bring him to packs and put him up during the Q and a and Tralala.

568
00:33:56,173 --> 00:34:00,160
Speaker 0: But anyway, here are, there are many videos and many interviews with him on the internet.

569
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:07,100
Speaker 0: And I will link you to the specific one of him watching a bunch of other people trouble allowing on YouTube.

570
00:34:07,300 --> 00:34:11,946
Speaker 0: That's my fan while people are photographing him and talking to him and even trouble lows a little bit.

571
00:34:11,987 --> 00:34:13,998
Speaker 0: And he says, he says a bunch of stuff.

572
00:34:14,018 --> 00:34:15,608
Speaker 0: Like he's, Oh, that guy's got the good.

573
00:34:15,648 --> 00:34:16,956
Speaker 0: Oh, that guy's good at singing.

574
00:34:17,378 --> 00:34:19,458
Speaker 0: You know, all the guys get a yellow tie just like me.

575
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:28,340
Speaker 1: One of my biggest fantasies has always been to see historical people watching internet memes about them like George Washington watching Washington.

576
00:34:29,001 --> 00:34:33,777
Speaker 0: But anyway, this guy when, you know, towards the end, he says something that's pretty fantastic.

577
00:34:33,817 --> 00:34:36,080
Speaker 0: He's like, I don't consider this parody.

578
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,714
Speaker 0: He's like look at the joy that these people are having.

579
00:34:38,735 --> 00:34:39,659
Speaker 0: Right.

580
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,418
Speaker 0: And now I know the Edward Kiel and Rick Astley are of the same.

581
00:34:46,161 --> 00:34:47,293
Speaker 1: I caught him in the same cloth.

582
00:34:47,353 --> 00:34:51,013
Speaker 0: We need, we need them to do a partnership.

583
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:52,480
Speaker 1: Someone who has money.

584
00:34:53,001 --> 00:34:53,739
Speaker 1: Make that hat.

585
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:01,929
Speaker 0: We need both of these talented vocalists to have some sort of duet situation of trullo law.

586
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:08,739
Speaker 0: Never give you up something, something, never going to troll low, low, never going to something along these lines needs to occur.

587
00:35:09,181 --> 00:35:15,626
Speaker 0: Perhaps even something as simple as taking the two videos and copying and pasting them together, right?

588
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:18,620
Speaker 0: If not bringing the two men together in a physical space.

589
00:35:19,041 --> 00:35:29,480
Speaker 1: Now this gives me two ideas for packs because you know, packs, unlike most cons we go to has that, uh, come up to the microphone and it's, I mean, it's nominally a Q and a, well there's two microphones.

590
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:37,374
Speaker 0: We could get in the same position in both lines and one person go up to the microphone and troll law and the person goes to the other microphone.

591
00:35:38,037 --> 00:35:40,779
Speaker 0: and you know, Rick roll at the same time.

592
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,279
Speaker 1: We could just time it and come up with some sort of bit where two people get to the microphone at the front at the same time and then do a bit.

593
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,079
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

594
00:35:47,401 --> 00:35:56,559
Speaker 1: But one thing to do is dress up as troll a low and either have a little speaker that'll play troll a low or be able to sing and actually troll a low.

595
00:35:57,622 --> 00:36:08,145
Speaker 1: The other thing is find out what it would take to get Rick Astley to come to the con with us and get him in line and perform perhaps the most epic Rick rolling that has ever been done.

596
00:36:08,165 --> 00:36:11,239
Speaker 0: He could wear like a, like a V mask, right?

597
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:16,940
Speaker 0: So as soon as he gets up to the front, start singing and then take the V mask off mid singing.

598
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:17,424
Speaker 1: Think about it.

599
00:36:17,464 --> 00:36:20,047
Speaker 1: He starts singing and people like, Oh, it's just a stupid Rick roll.

600
00:36:20,107 --> 00:36:20,892
Speaker 1: You asshole.

601
00:36:21,193 --> 00:36:22,300
Speaker 1: But then it's really Rick.

602
00:36:22,660 --> 00:36:23,243
Speaker 0: That's right.

603
00:36:23,263 --> 00:36:24,026
Speaker 0: Oh man.

604
00:36:24,509 --> 00:36:27,000
Speaker 0: Or it's the thing is I think he lives in the UK though.

605
00:36:27,181 --> 00:36:27,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to pay him.

606
00:36:28,008 --> 00:36:29,360
Speaker 0: We had to get him to come to Boston.

607
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,146
Speaker 0: This can be a lot of monies.

608
00:36:30,187 --> 00:36:30,469
Speaker 0: Yeah.

609
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:31,539
Speaker 1: Maybe, maybe impacts west.

610
00:36:32,281 --> 00:36:33,229
Speaker 0: That's gonna be more money.

611
00:36:33,450 --> 00:36:34,600
Speaker 1: So you got to really set it up.

612
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:35,810
Speaker 1: So you get two guys, right?

613
00:36:35,830 --> 00:36:36,940
Speaker 1: You'd combine the two ideas.

614
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,691
Speaker 1: One guy is two people.

615
00:36:39,711 --> 00:36:40,516
Speaker 0: Where does he live?

616
00:36:41,059 --> 00:36:41,240
Speaker 1: Right.

617
00:36:41,723 --> 00:36:44,940
Speaker 1: So it's me in a V mask and Rick Astley in a V mass.

618
00:36:45,341 --> 00:36:47,170
Speaker 1: We get up to the microphones at the same time.

619
00:36:47,190 --> 00:36:49,120
Speaker 1: I Rick roll in the V mass.

620
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:50,065
Speaker 1: People go boo.

621
00:36:50,085 --> 00:36:51,654
Speaker 1: I rip off the V mass.

622
00:36:51,674 --> 00:36:52,680
Speaker 1: People continue to boo.

623
00:36:53,481 --> 00:36:54,647
Speaker 1: He starts Rick rolling.

624
00:36:55,069 --> 00:36:56,435
Speaker 1: They go, ah, ha ha.

625
00:36:56,475 --> 00:36:58,646
Speaker 1: They coordinated it, but then they start to boo.

626
00:36:59,209 --> 00:37:00,555
Speaker 1: He rips off the V a mask.

627
00:37:00,696 --> 00:37:01,420
Speaker 1: It's really Rick.

628
00:37:02,541 --> 00:37:03,669
Speaker 0: That's a little complicated.

629
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:05,340
Speaker 1: It is, but imagine the payout.

630
00:37:07,102 --> 00:37:08,554
Speaker 1: I'd be willing to put forth a secret.

631
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:13,105
Speaker 1: If we took, the problem is if we took donations to try to do it, everyone would see it coming.

632
00:37:15,496 --> 00:37:16,380
Speaker 0: Oh, that is a problem.

633
00:37:17,021 --> 00:37:19,372
Speaker 0: Anyway, here's awesome videos.

634
00:37:19,392 --> 00:37:21,040
Speaker 0: And there's many linked YouTube videos.

635
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:27,031
Speaker 0: If you go to the related videos section, you can see this, uh, Edward Kiel, Trello low man being very cool.

636
00:37:27,051 --> 00:37:28,237
Speaker 0: He is an awesome dude.

637
00:37:28,257 --> 00:37:29,685
Speaker 1: That's, that's pretty Epic.

638
00:37:29,906 --> 00:37:30,067
Speaker 1: Yep.

639
00:37:30,852 --> 00:37:32,060
Speaker 1: So meta.

640
00:37:34,088 --> 00:37:36,280
Speaker 0: Oh man, we got met as we got conventions.

641
00:37:36,441 --> 00:37:41,320
Speaker 1: So this weekend is the last weekend where we are not going to be at a convention.

642
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,125
Speaker 0: The convention after that will be PAX East in Boston the weekend after this weekend.

643
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:51,784
Speaker 0: In other words, the weekend of March 19th to the 20th, nothing happening.

644
00:37:52,588 --> 00:38:02,900
Speaker 1: The weekend of March 26, 27, 28 PAX East and the arcade expo East coast in the, uh, Heinz convention center in Baltimore, Baltimore, Boston.

645
00:38:03,221 --> 00:38:04,165
Speaker 1: Yeah.

646
00:38:04,546 --> 00:38:10,791
Speaker 1: We may be live streaming as myself, but we're doing, we're going to try, we're doing 3.25 panels at PAX.

647
00:38:11,394 --> 00:38:12,720
Speaker 1: Most of them are on Friday.

648
00:38:13,821 --> 00:38:14,243
Speaker 0: That's good.

649
00:38:14,263 --> 00:38:19,960
Speaker 1: Uh, we're going to coordinate something, some sort of meetup, some sort of event where I don't know, we'll figure something out.

650
00:38:20,060 --> 00:38:33,391
Speaker 0: So in April two, three, four, the next weekend in the same, same bad place, same, well, almost the same bad time, same bad channel, anime Boston, where we are doing four panels.

651
00:38:33,873 --> 00:38:35,400
Speaker 1: We're doing five panels.

652
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,022
Speaker 0: Oh fuck.

653
00:38:36,042 --> 00:38:38,053
Speaker 0: We're doing, I believe anime.

654
00:38:38,094 --> 00:38:39,160
Speaker 1: You should see, okay.

655
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:43,053
Speaker 1: Bite-size anime, anime openers from around the world.

656
00:38:43,093 --> 00:38:46,300
Speaker 1: And I'll point out guys, I'm going to spoil a tiny bit of that panel.

657
00:38:46,841 --> 00:38:49,672
Speaker 1: I have the Gundam wing opener in German.

658
00:38:49,692 --> 00:38:51,700
Speaker 1: I have the Gundam wing opener.

659
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,560
Speaker 0: People are just going to get it on YouTube themselves.

660
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:57,180
Speaker 1: They won't need to come to the convention, but most people aren't going to know about this.

661
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:58,060
Speaker 1: They're not going to listen to this.

662
00:38:58,060 --> 00:39:00,020
Speaker 1: We're going to get like random people at anime Boston.

663
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:00,826
Speaker 1: Never heard of us.

664
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:01,755
Speaker 1: That's come to this panel.

665
00:39:01,815 --> 00:39:02,158
Speaker 1: I hope so.

666
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:06,200
Speaker 1: Gundam wing opener in Arabic from Saudi Arabia.

667
00:39:06,944 --> 00:39:08,212
Speaker 1: But then here's the gold.

668
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:12,840
Speaker 1: So in Saudi Arabia, they have an English channel and an Arabic channel.

669
00:39:13,362 --> 00:39:16,739
Speaker 1: It was so popular that they then decided to put Gundam wing on the Arabic channel.

670
00:39:17,221 --> 00:39:22,046
Speaker 1: They took the Arabic opener to Gundam wing that they had made and translated that into English.

671
00:39:22,287 --> 00:39:22,869
Speaker 0: Oh snap.

672
00:39:23,452 --> 00:39:23,814
Speaker 1: Oh man.

673
00:39:23,854 --> 00:39:25,280
Speaker 1: And that's just the tip of the iceberg.

674
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,578
Speaker 1: That's not even dangerous.

675
00:39:27,881 --> 00:39:32,308
Speaker 1: So we're also doing the secret guide to running an anime club, AKA the panel.

676
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,059
Speaker 1: we've done more times than any panel ever.

677
00:39:36,462 --> 00:39:41,960
Speaker 1: And I think we're doing, this isn't confirmed the how to run a panel panel as our throwaway panel.

678
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:42,460
Speaker 1: What?

679
00:39:43,446 --> 00:39:43,667
Speaker 1: Yeah.

680
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,216
Speaker 0: Where did this panel come from?

681
00:39:45,236 --> 00:39:46,020
Speaker 1: I put it in there.

682
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,760
Speaker 1: Cause remember we have to do a minimum number of panels to get paid.

683
00:39:49,483 --> 00:39:50,917
Speaker 0: So why are we doing how to run a panel?

684
00:39:50,938 --> 00:39:52,140
Speaker 0: We could do, we have better panels than that.

685
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:55,020
Speaker 0: Why don't we do like a comics for the manga reader or something?

686
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,653
Speaker 1: Cause I, I put that one in, but they didn't want it.

687
00:39:58,296 --> 00:40:00,106
Speaker 1: Also that panel, we got to step it up.

688
00:40:00,126 --> 00:40:01,315
Speaker 1: The panel is kind of lackluster.

689
00:40:01,496 --> 00:40:05,518
Speaker 0: No, but I mean, it's better than freaking, uh, uh, how to run a panel.

690
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:05,960
Speaker 1: Yeah.

691
00:40:06,782 --> 00:40:08,320
Speaker 0: But what's going to come to how to run a panel?

692
00:40:08,620 --> 00:40:10,470
Speaker 1: What panel will have more impact?

693
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:12,219
Speaker 1: Uh, Harris.

694
00:40:14,081 --> 00:40:14,302
Speaker 1: Okay.

695
00:40:14,343 --> 00:40:16,313
Speaker 1: Remember we could just Rick roll that panel.

696
00:40:16,333 --> 00:40:22,338
Speaker 0: So the weekend after that, right, March 10th and 11th, I'm pretty sure, let me just double check it.

697
00:40:23,523 --> 00:40:27,398
Speaker 0: Is the mocha arts festival in New York city.

698
00:40:27,458 --> 00:40:27,900
Speaker 0: That's right.

699
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:29,633
Speaker 0: 10th and 11th in the same building.

700
00:40:29,674 --> 00:40:30,440
Speaker 0: it was in last year.

701
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:31,517
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a million degrees now.

702
00:40:32,021 --> 00:40:35,858
Speaker 0: Even if it won't be a million degrees because it's April, maybe that's why they move into comics.

703
00:40:35,898 --> 00:40:38,253
Speaker 1: I mean, this is ostensibly a comic convention.

704
00:40:38,816 --> 00:40:39,460
Speaker 1: It is awesome.

705
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:42,080
Speaker 1: There is no human who would not enjoy themselves at the mocha.

706
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,720
Speaker 1: If you're in New York city and you're a Linux nerd, you should be at the mocha.

707
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,069
Speaker 1: You'll be pleasantly surprised.

708
00:40:47,089 --> 00:40:48,096
Speaker 0: You only need to come one day.

709
00:40:48,116 --> 00:40:55,067
Speaker 0: You know, you walk in, you look around, you check out awesome arts and comics and things and you go home and maybe go out to dinner in the city.

710
00:40:55,087 --> 00:40:55,632
Speaker 0: It's a nice day.

711
00:40:55,733 --> 00:40:55,914
Speaker 1: Yep.

712
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,499
Speaker 1: We'll be there.

713
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:58,250
Speaker 1: You might be able to go out to dinner with us.

714
00:40:58,270 --> 00:41:02,031
Speaker 1: Uh, if you're not, if you can find us and we don't blow you off.

715
00:41:02,373 --> 00:41:02,594
Speaker 0: Yeah.

716
00:41:02,835 --> 00:41:03,016
Speaker 0: Yeah.

717
00:41:03,278 --> 00:41:05,677
Speaker 0: But you know, you'll probably see us walking around at the very least.

718
00:41:05,859 --> 00:41:07,430
Speaker 0: I mean, I'll probably go there just Saturday.

719
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:10,830
Speaker 0: I don't think I'll go Sunday also, but you know, it's an awesome time.

720
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:12,176
Speaker 0: The mocha, you should go.

721
00:41:12,297 --> 00:41:12,820
Speaker 0: It's the win.

722
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:20,838
Speaker 1: I believe the weekend after that, we have not confirmed whether or not we'll be there yet is nexus, which is a big rationalist thought atheist convention in the city.

723
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,180
Speaker 1: Yep.

724
00:41:21,501 --> 00:41:26,460
Speaker 1: I haven't really planned much for that yet, but I'll note it because there's a decent chance we'll be there doing something.

725
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:26,980
Speaker 0: Okay.

726
00:41:27,041 --> 00:41:31,500
Speaker 0: And the final meta, at least for now, there is more metas coming later.

727
00:41:31,640 --> 00:41:36,986
Speaker 0: Oh no, there's a book club is Carl Sagan's cosmos, the book, not the TV series.

728
00:41:37,589 --> 00:41:40,260
Speaker 0: And we are experimenting with streaming still.

729
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:51,300
Speaker 0: We're going to try to do streaming at conventions and we're streaming geek nights is and streaming some other things, but we are currently experimenting with Justin TV and it seems to be working better than you stream.

730
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:57,679
Speaker 0: So make sure to follow geek nights on Twitter to be alerted to any streaming events.

731
00:41:58,122 --> 00:42:03,387
Speaker 0: And I'm going to try to like download all our recorded streams and put them some, you know, and work that all out.

732
00:42:03,507 --> 00:42:10,677
Speaker 1: So once I build that a server I was talking about, we're going to host video just straight up for streaming in addition to, you know, YouTube and whatever.

733
00:42:10,778 --> 00:42:10,940
Speaker 0: Yep.

734
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:18,677
Speaker 0: So keep your eyes on front recruit.com's news section and uh, you know, the Twitter slash twitter.com/geeknights and such and such.

735
00:42:18,817 --> 00:42:18,998
Speaker 1: Yep.

736
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:24,135
Speaker 1: I mean, don't expect, you know, we're, we're streaming this show, but it's basically just geek nights.

737
00:42:24,155 --> 00:42:25,080
Speaker 1: We're not doing anything special.

738
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,005
Speaker 1: It's mostly for us.

739
00:42:26,126 --> 00:42:27,333
Speaker 1: It's not for you if you enjoy it.

740
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:27,615
Speaker 1: Great.

741
00:42:27,655 --> 00:42:36,469
Speaker 0: But this isn't, yeah, we're streaming geek nights just to practice our streaming, but we are going to do other non geek nights shows that are video shows specifically that are different.

742
00:42:36,771 --> 00:42:37,919
Speaker 0: So watch out for those.

743
00:42:40,090 --> 00:42:47,620
Speaker 1: So, uh, I believe you can introduce this because you're the one who brought this up when we were doing our, uh, our test screen test morning show the other day.

744
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,220
Speaker 0: That is true.

745
00:42:48,341 --> 00:42:52,911
Speaker 0: So there was this article I read and the article was, is called whatever happened to programming.

746
00:42:52,931 --> 00:42:56,850
Speaker 0: And I read this article and I was like, good God, do I agree with this guy?

747
00:42:56,870 --> 00:43:03,653
Speaker 0: This guy is like speaking, you know, it's when you, someone says something and you're like, oh my God, you are so like speaking to me totally.

748
00:43:03,673 --> 00:43:04,396
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

749
00:43:04,416 --> 00:43:06,520
Speaker 0: You know, like a, like a valley girl.

750
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:10,100
Speaker 0: We'll talk about like a pop star boy band or a hippie.

751
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,957
Speaker 0: We'll talk about the dead or something like that.

752
00:43:12,038 --> 00:43:12,260
Speaker 0: Right?

753
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:13,949
Speaker 0: So this guy was talking like that.

754
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:15,500
Speaker 0: I was like, ah, he's so right.

755
00:43:16,042 --> 00:43:20,020
Speaker 0: And what this guy was talking about was how he learned to program, right?

756
00:43:20,100 --> 00:43:23,380
Speaker 0: When he was 14, he would write, let's see, I'll quote him exactly.

757
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:30,001
Speaker 0: I'm not going to read his whole article, but he says when he was 14, he wrote space invaders in basic on a Vic 20.

758
00:43:30,001 --> 00:43:42,844
Speaker 0: He wrote a mud in sea on a terminal attached to a sun three, when he was 22, he wrote, uh, the guts of a text database system still in sea now on a sun three 80.

759
00:43:42,844 --> 00:43:43,005
Speaker 0: Right.

760
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:54,991
Speaker 0: So, you know, this is the kind of coding that he was doing and the kind of coding that I learned to do right when I was a kid and also even in college was the same sort of stuff, right?

761
00:43:55,675 --> 00:44:03,992
Speaker 0: It's you, you have these basic constructs of software programming, you know, if while variables, right?

762
00:44:04,072 --> 00:44:07,528
Speaker 0: Functions, you know, for loops, right?

763
00:44:07,569 --> 00:44:14,140
Speaker 0: These sort of basic constructs, depending on what language you're using and at what level you are, you know, if you're an assembly, you don't have those, you don't have those functions.

764
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:20,480
Speaker 0: You have, you know, jump and, and, you know, move memory and these sorts of things, you know, and addition and subtraction.

765
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:36,819
Speaker 0: But programming was all about, you know, you have to, you have to build this piece of software and you have, you have these basic components to work with and you had to create an algorithm mixing, you know, these simple constructs together to build a more complicated thing.

766
00:44:36,839 --> 00:44:44,080
Speaker 0: You know, the complex emergent behavior of a, you know, a system that is just a bunch of simple things arranged in a complex way.

767
00:44:44,581 --> 00:44:46,129
Speaker 0: And that is what programming is all about.

768
00:44:46,170 --> 00:44:48,180
Speaker 0: And that is why programming is fun.

769
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:50,399
Speaker 0: It's like, aha, I need to write a hangman game.

770
00:44:50,581 --> 00:44:52,215
Speaker 0: And all I've got is variables and loops.

771
00:44:52,598 --> 00:44:53,564
Speaker 0: You know, how do I do this?

772
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:56,160
Speaker 0: And you solve this problem using these tools, right?

773
00:44:56,822 --> 00:45:06,500
Speaker 0: But nowadays at work, you know, the job that I have and most jobs that programmers have and most programming that is done is no longer this, right?

774
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:11,561
Speaker 0: Most people who program are not doing this behavior that I was taught to do.

775
00:45:11,823 --> 00:45:14,740
Speaker 0: And most people were taught to do in, in college, right?

776
00:45:15,165 --> 00:45:16,540
Speaker 0: Or wherever they learn programming.

777
00:45:17,042 --> 00:45:23,469
Speaker 0: All people are doing now is they're taking libraries or frameworks and gluing them together, right?

778
00:45:23,549 --> 00:45:30,920
Speaker 0: For example, I recently, wrote a small script that would go to Google docs, right?

779
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,840
Speaker 0: Get all, figure out what documents I had, right?

780
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:42,060
Speaker 0: Download any documents that were up there in a, in a, you know, PDF format or whatever, or doc format or whatever.

781
00:45:42,562 --> 00:45:45,617
Speaker 0: And then save those documents to Amazon S3, right?

782
00:45:46,861 --> 00:45:51,976
Speaker 0: So normally, right, if I was going to program this and say C from scratch, how would I do this?

783
00:45:52,038 --> 00:46:01,428
Speaker 0: Well, I need to make a TCP connection to Google and that I would need to figure out their protocol and I would have to send over to construct a packet and send it over and such, right?

784
00:46:01,448 --> 00:46:03,340
Speaker 0: And I had to do all these, these little things.

785
00:46:03,540 --> 00:46:09,760
Speaker 0: And I had to, you know, with, with just the basic tool set, I'd have to construct all this stuff, but nowadays is the library.

786
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,899
Speaker 0: So what I do in Python, I say, import G data, which is the Google data API.

787
00:46:14,561 --> 00:46:19,863
Speaker 0: Then I import Bato, which or S3, which is the Amazon S3 API, right?

788
00:46:20,165 --> 00:46:23,460
Speaker 0: And I say, G data dot, get list of documents.

789
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,500
Speaker 0: Then I get this list of documents in memory.

790
00:46:26,621 --> 00:46:29,540
Speaker 0: And then I just have to manipulate it a little bit to change the format of it.

791
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:40,471
Speaker 0: You know, maybe it's strings and, you know, I need to just change the shape of whatever that spits out and then need to take that new shape so that, you know, let's say Google data spits out a square, but Amazon S3 is a circle.

792
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:41,760
Speaker 0: I just need to round off the square.

793
00:46:42,361 --> 00:46:48,553
Speaker 0: And then I say Amazon dot S3 put data, the square, the circle that I've now circled.

794
00:46:48,613 --> 00:46:49,239
Speaker 0: And then it's done.

795
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,187
Speaker 1: Think about your work.

796
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:51,180
Speaker 1: You're, you're a programmer.

797
00:46:51,281 --> 00:46:56,069
Speaker 1: You know all about programming, like the basics of it, like, you know, bubble sort and all that kind of stuff.

798
00:46:56,753 --> 00:47:00,419
Speaker 1: But, and then I, you know, even the code I write now is basically the same thing.

799
00:47:00,641 --> 00:47:06,880
Speaker 1: I spend the vast majority of my time coding in the design part first, which I like, you know, designing like, what do I want to accomplish?

800
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:07,597
Speaker 1: What's my flow?

801
00:47:08,321 --> 00:47:12,180
Speaker 1: But then implementing it is 99% looking up the syntax of libraries.

802
00:47:13,042 --> 00:47:14,593
Speaker 1: Like what object does this take?

803
00:47:14,935 --> 00:47:15,600
Speaker 1: What does it output?

804
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,451
Speaker 1: What's the name of the method I have to call?

805
00:47:17,672 --> 00:47:18,859
Speaker 1: What do I have to give this method?

806
00:47:19,304 --> 00:47:25,213
Speaker 1: It's there's at no point in my, like maybe 1% of the code I write is the part I care about doing the thing I want it to do.

807
00:47:26,001 --> 00:47:29,299
Speaker 1: But 99% of the rest of what I write is just the glue between the pieces.

808
00:47:29,722 --> 00:47:32,278
Speaker 0: Well, now see here, the, here are the problems with this, right?

809
00:47:32,358 --> 00:47:34,267
Speaker 0: Well, here's the good parts, right?

810
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:36,980
Speaker 0: If you want to do something complicated, right?

811
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:41,080
Speaker 0: Like, let's say, you know, copy all your Google docs to Amazon or something, right?

812
00:47:41,381 --> 00:47:53,035
Speaker 0: It's actually pretty easy for a normal person to read the documentation and sort of figure out how to do it, even if you're not so good at programming, you know, because you can just read and read and read and read documentation until there's an answer.

813
00:47:53,055 --> 00:47:57,940
Speaker 0: And they say, Oh, use this line and that'll spit this out and then use this line to send it over.

814
00:47:58,230 --> 00:47:58,460
Speaker 0: Right?

815
00:47:58,820 --> 00:48:12,565
Speaker 0: So it gives normal people who actually dare to venture into the areas of writing code, you know, in Python or Ruby or something like that, vast powers to do advanced functionality that is not available in other software.

816
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:12,929
Speaker 0: Right?

817
00:48:13,192 --> 00:48:13,980
Speaker 0: So that is a good thing.

818
00:48:14,421 --> 00:48:14,582
Speaker 1: Yep.

819
00:48:14,703 --> 00:48:25,160
Speaker 1: And no one's going to argue that it's kind of like when we talk about, you know, changes in video games over the years or how eight bit 16 bit, we're never going to say you should go back to the crappy technology because it happened to make a few things better.

820
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,000
Speaker 0: Now here are the problems with this, right?

821
00:48:27,140 --> 00:48:35,520
Speaker 0: Problem number one is that a lot of these libraries that you're, you know, importing to get these advanced functions from actually kind of suck ass.

822
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:44,340
Speaker 0: So what happens is, you know, everyone out there who wants to do X, right, uses this library because it's the one, right, that's out there.

823
00:48:44,481 --> 00:48:45,530
Speaker 0: And it has all the functions.

824
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:53,206
Speaker 0: But if it sucks, now everyone using it is writing shitty software and nobody's making library itself any better.

825
00:48:53,266 --> 00:48:59,680
Speaker 0: Cause no, basically anything that happens in the library, even if it's open source, almost no one actually looks at the source of it.

826
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:01,399
Speaker 0: No one's investigating how it works.

827
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:06,114
Speaker 0: They're only concerned with their own code and as long as no bugs in the underlying code.

828
00:49:06,134 --> 00:49:13,999
Speaker 1: I mean, my, my interaction with the Python SNMP frame or the SNMP like stuff is basically just, well, how do I make it work in my program?

829
00:49:14,181 --> 00:49:16,197
Speaker 1: I've never even looked at what it actually is doing.

830
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:16,439
Speaker 0: Yeah.

831
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,960
Speaker 0: And if it had a bug in it, right, what would you do?

832
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:21,295
Speaker 1: I would code around the bug in my code.

833
00:49:21,335 --> 00:49:26,800
Speaker 1: I'd be like, all right, if I try to send a trap out through it, it sends the trap wrong cause it doesn't spoof the ID right or something.

834
00:49:27,141 --> 00:49:33,249
Speaker 1: So I'll send it a fake ID and I'll make a wrapper around the library to send it this, the data it'll need.

835
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:35,220
Speaker 1: So I know that then the output of it will be correct.

836
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:39,540
Speaker 0: You might report the bug right on the, to the open source project.

837
00:49:40,061 --> 00:49:41,828
Speaker 0: If it is open source, right?

838
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:45,820
Speaker 0: I mean the G data API, I don't know how it's, I think it's kind of open source.

839
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,536
Speaker 0: I don't know exactly how open source it is.

840
00:49:47,557 --> 00:49:48,968
Speaker 0: You know, I don't see why it would be closed.

841
00:49:49,029 --> 00:49:52,640
Speaker 0: Google does open source a lot of things, but you know, there are some things that aren't open source.

842
00:49:52,700 --> 00:50:01,600
Speaker 0: So in that case it is a black box, but you know, very few people actually patch or will go and look at the code of anything, you know, to figure out what's going on underneath.

843
00:50:01,661 --> 00:50:03,499
Speaker 1: I think there's a far more subtle danger here.

844
00:50:04,203 --> 00:50:08,232
Speaker 1: And I run into this a lot and it, a lot of times programming tasks seem very daunting.

845
00:50:08,252 --> 00:50:16,119
Speaker 1: and imagine a non programmer and you're trying to show them some code or they're looking at some code, like not teaching code, but real working code.

846
00:50:17,362 --> 00:50:29,539
Speaker 1: It is 100% incomprehensible, even though most programming languages, like the structure of them is inherently readable, you know, make this variable, put something in this variable, do something with it, call this function, go here, you know, all this basic stuff.

847
00:50:30,281 --> 00:50:34,420
Speaker 1: But when your code basically is, use this function in this library.

848
00:50:34,721 --> 00:50:36,860
Speaker 1: Now take the output from that and use it in this library.

849
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,749
Speaker 1: Now use this library.

850
00:50:37,790 --> 00:50:38,640
Speaker 1: Now use this library.

851
00:50:39,521 --> 00:50:43,799
Speaker 1: It's all basically the wizard using magic words to make things happen.

852
00:50:44,403 --> 00:50:44,604
Speaker 0: Yeah.

853
00:50:44,645 --> 00:50:46,460
Speaker 1: It's pretty much like it's just magic words.

854
00:50:46,560 --> 00:50:46,641
Speaker 0: Yeah.

855
00:50:46,661 --> 00:50:48,070
Speaker 0: You're not solving a problem.

856
00:50:48,090 --> 00:50:49,680
Speaker 0: You're not coming up with an algorithm.

857
00:50:49,961 --> 00:50:53,058
Speaker 0: You're basically looking up in, you know, a spell book.

858
00:50:53,319 --> 00:50:53,540
Speaker 0: Okay.

859
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,580
Speaker 0: What spells are available, right?

860
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,260
Speaker 0: And one spell is upload to this and one spell is download from that.

861
00:50:59,801 --> 00:51:02,916
Speaker 0: And all these spells are already in these libraries, right?

862
00:51:02,936 --> 00:51:03,700
Speaker 0: These spell books.

863
00:51:05,008 --> 00:51:15,259
Speaker 0: It's like, all right, figure out which spells to cast in which order and how to get the, you know, the rabbit that's created by the first spell to go into the hat that, you know, the second spell needs.

864
00:51:15,561 --> 00:51:20,900
Speaker 1: So I want to turn this rabbit into a gold for some reason.

865
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:22,267
Speaker 1: I want to make a gold rabbit.

866
00:51:22,348 --> 00:51:22,649
Speaker 1: All right.

867
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:24,520
Speaker 1: Or so, all right.

868
00:51:24,621 --> 00:51:28,800
Speaker 1: I don't have say the only spells I ever polymorph other, but it doesn't let me turn it into a mineral.

869
00:51:28,901 --> 00:51:32,427
Speaker 1: It only lets me turn it in another animal, but I have some other spell.

870
00:51:32,447 --> 00:51:36,024
Speaker 1: that's like turn person into stone and then I have some other thing.

871
00:51:36,085 --> 00:51:36,569
Speaker 1: that's all right.

872
00:51:36,610 --> 00:51:37,719
Speaker 1: Turn stone into gold.

873
00:51:38,101 --> 00:51:42,765
Speaker 1: So I take these three spells and make this really clunky framework that turns the rabbit into gold.

874
00:51:43,026 --> 00:51:43,247
Speaker 0: Yep.

875
00:51:43,549 --> 00:51:53,915
Speaker 0: Whereas if you were writing and say assembler, you probably could have in very few lines, turn the rabbit into gold and it would be if you did, if you're a quality programmer, it would have been a much more quality solution.

876
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,914
Speaker 0: And the thing is, this isn't just libraries either, right?

877
00:51:57,196 --> 00:51:59,500
Speaker 0: For example, let's say I want to make a website, right?

878
00:51:59,820 --> 00:52:03,300
Speaker 0: Now most websites out there don't really need to be high performance.

879
00:52:03,824 --> 00:52:04,931
Speaker 0: Super awesome, right?

880
00:52:04,951 --> 00:52:06,180
Speaker 0: You know, a blog, whatever.

881
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:11,997
Speaker 0: But let's say you use Apache, the web server, you know, you put up some HTML files, the server serves them out.

882
00:52:12,037 --> 00:52:12,480
Speaker 0: Very nice.

883
00:52:13,160 --> 00:52:15,231
Speaker 0: But let's say you need to do something advanced, right?

884
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:17,702
Speaker 0: Like let's say Twitter, right?

885
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:27,100
Speaker 0: Instead of say, you could write Twitter in, you know, you could, there are Twitter clones in every language now, you know, and you could use like mod Python on Apache, right?

886
00:52:27,841 --> 00:52:32,138
Speaker 0: You could also just write Twitter as a standalone application.

887
00:52:32,299 --> 00:52:34,830
Speaker 0: You know, it would open up port 80.

888
00:52:34,830 --> 00:52:37,704
Speaker 0: It would accept incoming connections on port 80, right?

889
00:52:37,724 --> 00:52:40,447
Speaker 0: You don't have Apache in the picture, you know, get all that stuff out of the way.

890
00:52:40,468 --> 00:52:42,320
Speaker 0: I am writing a single program.

891
00:52:42,501 --> 00:52:44,774
Speaker 0: I could write it in freaking C or anything I wanted.

892
00:52:44,835 --> 00:52:46,041
Speaker 0: It opens up port 80.

893
00:52:46,041 --> 00:52:47,146
Speaker 0: It acts as a web server.

894
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,840
Speaker 0: It reads HTTP, you know, headers coming in.

895
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:50,924
Speaker 0: It figures out what to do.

896
00:52:51,366 --> 00:53:03,219
Speaker 0: And if I did do this, the performance of, you know, and the benefits of doing it well and the ability to scale and the ability to control every aspect of the program would be so vastly superior.

897
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:14,780
Speaker 0: You know, I've heard things like mebo.com are written in C plus plus, you know, people are doing things like this, you know, it is not unheard of, but fewer and fewer people are doing things like this now.

898
00:53:15,381 --> 00:53:21,576
Speaker 0: One of the other negative effects of this that I see is that I think people are going to forget how to do this.

899
00:53:21,677 --> 00:53:24,835
Speaker 1: Well, no, I think you end up having two different kinds of coders.

900
00:53:25,378 --> 00:53:40,900
Speaker 1: I mean, people who are just practical coders, you know, working with real life code only who didn't study code independently of the real world applications who just have to get stuff done will be very proficient at knowing the names of all the modules and libraries and how to link them all together to be the glue.

901
00:53:41,802 --> 00:53:45,858
Speaker 1: But they can't actually address anything complex if the libraries don't already do it.

902
00:53:45,940 --> 00:53:55,860
Speaker 0: But I think that fewer and fewer people will, there'll be less and less people who know how to modify or write a library, you know, and then there'll be even fewer people who do it well.

903
00:53:55,981 --> 00:53:58,059
Speaker 0: So many libraries out there just suck.

904
00:53:58,461 --> 00:54:05,560
Speaker 1: Well, the people, I think a university education or, you know, any sort of like theoretical education in coding will give you that.

905
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:12,975
Speaker 1: I think it makes it a more subtle problem is that it makes it very difficult for people who want to learn how to code to get into it.

906
00:54:13,015 --> 00:54:22,897
Speaker 1: because the old adage, and I used to agree with this a lot was, all right, if you want to learn how to code, the quickest way is to code something you need that works because you'll be motivated to finish it.

907
00:54:23,382 --> 00:54:28,560
Speaker 1: But if you just code something that'll do what you need it to do, you're just going to take libraries and bang them together.

908
00:54:29,021 --> 00:54:42,288
Speaker 1: But if you learn how to code in a very simple, like that basic thing that we were talking about the other day, if you learn how to code something in basic, you're going to learn all the basic logic concepts of what coding means as opposed to the practical glue crap.

909
00:54:43,574 --> 00:54:52,780
Speaker 1: Of course, in the end, the practical reality is that gluing different pieces of data together is 99% of what the world needs for everything.

910
00:54:53,602 --> 00:54:53,764
Speaker 0: Yeah.

911
00:54:53,784 --> 00:54:54,958
Speaker 0: Well, that's, you know, that's the other thing.

912
00:54:54,978 --> 00:54:56,454
Speaker 0: It's like, I'm sitting at my job, right?

913
00:54:56,475 --> 00:55:04,360
Speaker 0: And it's like, I have the skills to write a library, you know, depending on the library, of course, I probably couldn't write libraries for certain things, but for other things I could do a pretty good job.

914
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:07,115
Speaker 0: And for other things I could do a great job, but I never do.

915
00:55:07,135 --> 00:55:07,195
Speaker 0: Why?

916
00:55:07,477 --> 00:55:11,814
Speaker 0: Well, because at work, no one's ever going to pay me to sit around and do that.

917
00:55:11,874 --> 00:55:17,038
Speaker 0: when I could just reuse something and get the job done faster and save more, you know, there's no money reason to do it.

918
00:55:17,361 --> 00:55:24,259
Speaker 0: So fewer and fewer people are going to pay anyone to write libraries and basically shitty libraries will dominate and software will get shittier and shittier.

919
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:34,032
Speaker 0: And I think actually if software didn't get shittier and people actually were writing their code better that we could get a lot more out of the hardware that we've got, you know?

920
00:55:34,052 --> 00:55:48,500
Speaker 0: Uh, and right now I think that actually software might be getting shittier at a sort of, you know, dangerous rate to where like our hardware is, you know, we're not, we're really starting to lose, you know, it's like, you need to get that faster CPU only because the software is crappy.

921
00:55:48,580 --> 00:55:51,720
Speaker 1: I am somewhat hesitant to say that to go down that road.

922
00:55:51,820 --> 00:56:06,580
Speaker 0: It's not for, I'm not saying for like normal people, but you'll notice it and say large, uh, applications and scaling big things, you know, like people are out there and what they're doing to scale things like Facebook and such, you know, is, you know, my website is too many visitors.

923
00:56:06,621 --> 00:56:07,355
Speaker 0: So what do I do?

924
00:56:07,375 --> 00:56:12,687
Speaker 0: Well, I'll just have more web servers and a load balancer and I'll get more database servers and more, right.

925
00:56:12,748 --> 00:56:14,459
Speaker 0: And men cashed and all this stuff.

926
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:24,431
Speaker 1: But at the same time, be careful because so many people make the slippery slope argument of, we should just write everything in assembler because that is the way to get, you know, we're some fast hardware made us lazy.

927
00:56:24,451 --> 00:56:24,571
Speaker 1: Yeah.

928
00:56:24,852 --> 00:56:26,620
Speaker 0: Sometimes you should though.

929
00:56:26,761 --> 00:56:27,424
Speaker 0: And I think the thing is.

930
00:56:27,585 --> 00:56:32,702
Speaker 0: the thing is people are doing it zero times and they're the cases where they should write it in assembler, they're not.

931
00:56:32,783 --> 00:56:34,939
Speaker 0: or the case of they should write it and see they're not.

932
00:56:34,979 --> 00:56:44,020
Speaker 0: Well, look at how Java does it with the Justin time compilation and like the way Java, a lot of those LLVM J I T things are going to help us out a whole lot.

933
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:49,131
Speaker 1: But it's the idea that, you know, in an average program, you write 98% of the program uses like 1% of the resources.

934
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,740
Speaker 1: You've got one tiny piece of your program that is the resource intensive part.

935
00:56:55,122 --> 00:56:57,620
Speaker 1: And it's usually orders of magnitude more intensive than everything else.

936
00:56:57,640 --> 00:56:59,331
Speaker 1: Cause that's where the work is done.

937
00:56:59,834 --> 00:57:00,740
Speaker 1: You know, that's like the loop.

938
00:57:00,881 --> 00:57:07,034
Speaker 1: In my case that scrapes the billion, well not billions, the tens of millions of log lines per second.

939
00:57:07,537 --> 00:57:11,860
Speaker 1: And you know, does something with them like that part of the program is 99% of the performance.

940
00:57:12,401 --> 00:57:17,420
Speaker 1: That's the case where you hire someone or you let someone write an assembler program that does that perfectly.

941
00:57:18,100 --> 00:57:21,636
Speaker 1: And then you have people like me do the glue around that library.

942
00:57:21,656 --> 00:57:22,058
Speaker 1: Yep.

943
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:24,822
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you look like in Python, you can see, cause.

944
00:57:24,842 --> 00:57:32,060
Speaker 0: in Python and many other high level languages, you can write like a part in C, you know, a lot of people write a game and then put the really intensive part.

945
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:43,980
Speaker 0: They'll write in C and import that as, you know, the library will be C. Like SciPy is a science library for Python, but SciPy itself is written in C, you know, so SciPy is really fast and kind of awesome.

946
00:57:44,322 --> 00:57:54,658
Speaker 0: And then you can just write easy Python code to use it, you know, and if people would do those things more often, even when they don't have to, right, we could get a lot more performance and a lot better things.

947
00:57:54,719 --> 00:58:05,463
Speaker 0: Now, the major problem that I have personally, and is why this guy, you know, with his article was speaking to me so much is that I hate writing this glue code.

948
00:58:05,484 --> 00:58:06,871
Speaker 0: It is not what I learned to do.

949
00:58:06,931 --> 00:58:08,580
Speaker 0: It's not why I like programming.

950
00:58:08,800 --> 00:58:10,300
Speaker 0: It's boring and sort of painful.

951
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:13,760
Speaker 0: All I do every day is I have to look stuff up, right?

952
00:58:13,821 --> 00:58:16,160
Speaker 0: I look up the magic words and then I type them in.

953
00:58:16,340 --> 00:58:17,670
Speaker 0: I look up the magic words and I type them in.

954
00:58:17,710 --> 00:58:20,305
Speaker 0: I'm not solving problems, which is what I like doing.

955
00:58:20,707 --> 00:58:21,972
Speaker 0: It's not fun.

956
00:58:22,012 --> 00:58:25,559
Speaker 0: It doesn't satisfy my, you know, it's not why I like coding.

957
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,695
Speaker 1: I'm speccing out a huge program at work right now.

958
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:36,220
Speaker 1: Like I'm, I'm speccing out the stuff that we're then going to write and we're going to outsource to some people, you know, some of the writing of it and modules and everything and speccing it out.

959
00:58:36,482 --> 00:58:40,832
Speaker 1: When I finally had time to do it, you know, I sat down for three hours, like how am I going to architect the software?

960
00:58:41,194 --> 00:58:42,140
Speaker 1: That was super fun.

961
00:58:42,461 --> 00:58:44,773
Speaker 1: Like that was the most fun I've had at work in a long time.

962
00:58:45,477 --> 00:58:48,539
Speaker 1: And then it was like, all right, how, how are we going to actually code this?

963
00:58:49,221 --> 00:58:53,060
Speaker 1: And then it was just looking up libraries, looking up the capabilities of them.

964
00:58:53,621 --> 00:58:59,011
Speaker 1: Actually writing the code is going to be horrifyingly tedious because no part of what we're doing is novel.

965
00:58:59,455 --> 00:58:59,919
Speaker 1: No part.

966
00:59:00,421 --> 00:59:06,410
Speaker 1: What's novel is that no one has glued together all these individually solved problems together in a way that works before.

967
00:59:06,872 --> 00:59:11,060
Speaker 0: Now, you know, sometimes, you know, of course gluing, you know, creates many awesome things.

968
00:59:11,080 --> 00:59:15,366
Speaker 0: Look how many people have done some awesome stuff just by gluing Google maps to whatever or whatever.

969
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:15,688
Speaker 0: Right.

970
00:59:16,151 --> 00:59:17,480
Speaker 0: You know, and that's it's so easy.

971
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,999
Speaker 0: That's why so many people are able to do it.

972
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:23,078
Speaker 1: Well, it's also the most important part of information technology right now.

973
00:59:23,118 --> 00:59:29,550
Speaker 1: today is taking data sets that are not connected and somehow connecting them to accomplish some third goal.

974
00:59:29,611 --> 00:59:29,853
Speaker 0: Yes.

975
00:59:29,974 --> 00:59:34,417
Speaker 0: And it is wonderful, except for the fact that it is really the actual act of doing it.

976
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:38,056
Speaker 0: You know, coming up with the idea to do it is solving a problem.

977
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:38,780
Speaker 0: How do I do this?

978
00:59:38,820 --> 00:59:41,111
Speaker 0: How do I, you know, make podcasting better?

979
00:59:41,292 --> 00:59:43,724
Speaker 0: Oh, well, you do this and this and this and this and this and this.

980
00:59:43,885 --> 00:59:51,560
Speaker 0: Well, think about a manual labor of actually creating that solution is horrendously painful and tedious and slow.

981
00:59:51,681 --> 01:00:03,135
Speaker 0: And this is why so many people just say, fuck it and install WordPress rather than writing a blog or, you know, fuck it and using Ruby on rails instead of, you know, this is the same reason it sucks to be a DBA.

982
01:00:03,235 --> 01:00:10,399
Speaker 1: And like at RIT, they tried to trick people into joining the database concentration and everyone took the first database database class and said, you know what?

983
01:00:10,680 --> 01:00:11,022
Speaker 1: Fuck this.

984
01:00:11,585 --> 01:00:14,220
Speaker 1: Because the fun part is I've got two data sets.

985
01:00:14,320 --> 01:00:18,538
Speaker 1: I want to mash them together and do X and here's my process and here's, I want to accomplish it.

986
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:24,420
Speaker 1: The not fun part is select X from table outer join blah.

987
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:43,485
Speaker 0: The thing is actually SQL is kind of fun for me, especially, you know, not just normal everyday mundane SQL, but sometimes it's like you have some data arrangements and tables and it's like, I need to get this complicated query, you know, I need to figure out how many of these per those on Mondays, you know, something like that.

988
01:00:43,526 --> 01:00:53,040
Speaker 0: And that, you know, SQL can be fun in that way, you know, and there's actually, that's sort of the problem is you look at things like, you know, there's a lot of ORMs out there and object relational mapper.

989
01:00:53,162 --> 01:00:58,419
Speaker 0: If anyone doesn't know what that is, Django and Ruby on rails have these as many other things do.

990
01:00:59,260 --> 01:01:30,060
Speaker 0: Basically you can interact with a database without writing any SQL like Django, you know, which I use and it's, you know, what the front recruit.com runs on and that's what I use at work is, you know, it's a Python web framework and basically if you don't want to, you almost never have to actually write SQL, but it's talking to an SQL database, but you don't write any SQL, you do something like, you know, episode, you know, if I'm doing geek nights, right, I would do episodes dot objects, dot filter, uh, you know, category equals Monday.

991
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:33,157
Speaker 0: And that would give me a list of all the Monday episodes behind the scenes.

992
01:01:33,861 --> 01:01:42,340
Speaker 0: It's generating, you know, select from episodes, underscore episode, you know, where category equals, right.

993
01:01:42,580 --> 01:01:45,400
Speaker 0: So it's generating SQL, you know, and it's on the front end.

994
01:01:45,540 --> 01:01:47,694
Speaker 0: I'm just dealing with objects and this is really easy.

995
01:01:48,116 --> 01:01:50,528
Speaker 0: The thing is, the SQL it generates is shit.

996
01:01:50,930 --> 01:01:53,300
Speaker 0: I can get just about any page on our site.

997
01:01:53,501 --> 01:01:56,060
Speaker 0: I can get all the data with one query, one clever query.

998
01:01:56,441 --> 01:01:59,817
Speaker 0: Most of the time it's making like 10 queries because it's just stupid.

999
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:00,460
Speaker 0: Right.

1000
01:02:00,580 --> 01:02:05,807
Speaker 0: But the only benefit of using an ORM is that it makes things easier for the developer to glue.

1001
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:07,440
Speaker 0: It has no other benefit whatsoever.

1002
01:02:08,062 --> 01:02:10,879
Speaker 0: And it has this severe detriment of making really stupid SQL.

1003
01:02:11,480 --> 01:02:13,449
Speaker 1: So what if someone made better glue?

1004
01:02:13,489 --> 01:02:17,958
Speaker 1: What if that wrapper was not technologically possible as a problem?

1005
01:02:18,019 --> 01:02:24,912
Speaker 0: No, because objects don't match to relational databases and object model and a relational model are not correlative.

1006
01:02:24,952 --> 01:02:25,857
Speaker 0: You can't do it.

1007
01:02:26,078 --> 01:02:29,840
Speaker 0: You know, if you were going to use one of those no SQL databases, right?

1008
01:02:29,900 --> 01:02:39,833
Speaker 0: Like let's say CouchDB or Cassandra, which are becoming very popular, then you could have an object, which of course, as long as it's a object, you know, can correspond to the schema-lessness.

1009
01:02:39,973 --> 01:02:41,902
Speaker 0: if you're using a schema-less one, right.

1010
01:02:42,224 --> 01:02:44,680
Speaker 0: You could, you know, have an object that maps, right.

1011
01:02:44,781 --> 01:02:46,260
Speaker 0: And it works, would work a lot better.

1012
01:02:46,661 --> 01:02:51,120
Speaker 0: The problem is, is that these no SQL databases are non-relational by nature.

1013
01:02:51,222 --> 01:03:03,859
Speaker 0: That's sort of the point, you know, they sacrifice the relational features in favor of, you know, different abilities to scale and clone and have a bunch of servers really easily and such, you know, easier partitioning and things like that.

1014
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,460
Speaker 0: The thing is they're non-relational.

1015
01:03:06,641 --> 01:03:12,436
Speaker 0: So what do I do if I want to say code Facebook where rim is a friend of Scott and I have these relations?

1016
01:03:12,597 --> 01:03:21,440
Speaker 0: Well, basically what you end up doing is instead of doing joins on the database side, you end up coding the actual logic of a join in your program.

1017
01:03:21,621 --> 01:03:25,985
Speaker 0: And now the server itself is doing the joining as opposed to the database server doing the joining.

1018
01:03:26,548 --> 01:03:26,750
Speaker 0: Right.

1019
01:03:26,810 --> 01:03:34,290
Speaker 0: And it's going to be a lot less efficient than, you know, make a database of objects compared to Postgres, which is really good at fricking joining.

1020
01:03:34,611 --> 01:03:36,763
Speaker 0: compared to your Python code that's going to join.

1021
01:03:36,783 --> 01:03:37,327
Speaker 0: Give me a break.

1022
01:03:37,549 --> 01:03:37,790
Speaker 1: Yep.

1023
01:03:38,153 --> 01:03:44,039
Speaker 1: So at the same time, the your Python code is easier for 99% of people to deal with than Postgres.

1024
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:48,683
Speaker 1: I mean, I have trouble even installing Postgres and I use it as a professional on a daily basis.

1025
01:03:49,005 --> 01:03:49,286
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1026
01:03:50,432 --> 01:04:03,413
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's, you know, it's just really, I want to write, you know, the kind of code that is, you know, the kind of code I learned, you know, take these simple constructs, loops, variables, you know, functions, et cetera, right?

1027
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:04,217
Speaker 0: Even classes.

1028
01:04:04,659 --> 01:04:08,984
Speaker 0: And, you know, build up, write the algorithms, you know, make them better, make them fast.

1029
01:04:09,024 --> 01:04:09,910
Speaker 1: You know what you're saying?

1030
01:04:09,930 --> 01:04:11,280
Speaker 1: You're saying I'll paraphrase.

1031
01:04:12,062 --> 01:04:15,943
Speaker 1: I should have stayed in college and gone into academia and gotten my doctorate in coding.

1032
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:17,858
Speaker 0: Not really.

1033
01:04:17,879 --> 01:04:21,600
Speaker 0: I mean, there are jobs out there you can get where you're still writing low level code.

1034
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:24,413
Speaker 1: You know, you could have gotten a job like that with my company.

1035
01:04:24,433 --> 01:04:26,522
Speaker 0: Uh, no, not really.

1036
01:04:26,603 --> 01:04:27,306
Speaker 0: Yeah, no.

1037
01:04:27,366 --> 01:04:36,840
Speaker 0: The guy needs to get a job, say like not writing, like an Android app, but writing Android itself, you know, like, you know, writing drivers for mobile handset,

1038
01:04:37,420 --> 01:04:42,790
Speaker 1: but you're just gluing the software and hardware together by calling the hardware, you know, effectively API

1039
01:04:44,075 --> 01:04:47,090
Speaker 0: sort of, but sort of not, you know, you, you basically,

1040
01:04:47,150 --> 01:04:48,739
Speaker 1: I think the point I'm making here is just

1041
01:04:48,759 --> 01:04:50,286
Speaker 0: the thing is the hardware API

1042
01:04:50,427 --> 01:04:51,211
Speaker 1: hard different.

1043
01:04:51,251 --> 01:04:53,100
Speaker 1: There's a long sliding scale.

1044
01:04:53,545 --> 01:05:00,396
Speaker 1: And I think there are two factors here, two almost completely separate scales that right now, at least for what we do happen to correlate very strongly.

1045
01:05:00,456 --> 01:05:08,399
Speaker 1: on one side, there's the, is this fun for me scale, which happens to correlate to, is this just coding around libraries and gluing things together?

1046
01:05:09,422 --> 01:05:18,445
Speaker 1: And if we could somehow, I don't know if it's possible, break the two sliders so that it's fun to glue, which you know, what an example of that is.

1047
01:05:18,465 --> 01:05:25,358
Speaker 1: Well, if everyone doubler and a very simple way, you, you made it really fun to glue things together.

1048
01:05:25,419 --> 01:05:28,637
Speaker 1: Of course, you sacrificed every other aspect of gluing things together to do it.

1049
01:05:30,922 --> 01:05:31,244
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1050
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:32,811
Speaker 0: The thing is, right.

1051
01:05:32,952 --> 01:05:38,694
Speaker 0: It's like when you glue things together, you have to do that little bit of work in between the, in between the two things you're gluing, right?

1052
01:05:38,714 --> 01:05:40,891
Speaker 0: To make the match, to get the square peg and the square hole.

1053
01:05:41,233 --> 01:05:46,620
Speaker 0: And when you're working, say, to combine Google maps, that combining work is usually really boring and stupid.

1054
01:05:46,721 --> 01:05:49,798
Speaker 0: You know, Oh, I have to remove the space from the end of the string.

1055
01:05:49,818 --> 01:05:52,940
Speaker 0: Oh, I have to parse this XML to get the name of something, right?

1056
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:54,066
Speaker 0: It's just really stupid shit.

1057
01:05:54,509 --> 01:05:56,480
Speaker 0: If you're doing something on a lower level, right?

1058
01:05:56,860 --> 01:06:02,181
Speaker 0: That in between work of gluing, say a GPU to a game or something like that, right?

1059
01:06:02,201 --> 01:06:05,880
Speaker 0: That in between square peg, you know, turn the square peg into a circle peg.

1060
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:10,299
Speaker 0: So if it's in a circle, whole work is actually far more interesting work.

1061
01:06:10,721 --> 01:06:13,600
Speaker 1: Well, I think in that case, it's a lot more complicated.

1062
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,557
Speaker 0: There's actually problems to solve rather than just things to do.

1063
01:06:17,577 --> 01:06:24,880
Speaker 0: You know, you have to figure out, Oh shit, you know, this GPU only does this and this, you know, so I need to figure out something.

1064
01:06:25,020 --> 01:06:32,499
Speaker 0: There's actually a problem to solve as opposed to just, you know, uh, a magic word to figure out in some documentation.

1065
01:06:32,519 --> 01:06:37,658
Speaker 1: Well, you could go back to what you were doing before when you were working on, you know, like embedded stuff, batteries, things like that.

1066
01:06:37,719 --> 01:06:37,860
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1067
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:40,755
Speaker 0: But I have to go figure out how to work on that again.

1068
01:06:40,775 --> 01:06:42,263
Speaker 0: It's been so long, right?

1069
01:06:42,323 --> 01:06:44,374
Speaker 0: That my skills in that area are depleted.

1070
01:06:44,434 --> 01:06:45,319
Speaker 0: I need to rebuild them.

1071
01:06:47,040 --> 01:06:50,740
Speaker 0: But yeah, in general, it's just, this is the way the programming is going.

1072
01:06:50,800 --> 01:06:54,092
Speaker 0: And I wonder, you know, it could be, there's going to be goods and there's going to be bads.

1073
01:06:54,152 --> 01:06:57,099
Speaker 0: And I hope that, uh, we can, you know, figure something out.

1074
01:06:57,462 --> 01:07:04,320
Speaker 1: I think good in the long run, but not for, I think from third factors and just the advance of technology, making things act differently.

1075
01:07:04,882 --> 01:07:10,119
Speaker 1: I think the really important part of this is not the technology because the wrappers will eventually be really good.

1076
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:17,536
Speaker 1: The problem is going to be the fun part because it'll never be more fun for people like you to write code, no matter how good the glue gets.

1077
01:07:17,556 --> 01:07:18,380
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1078
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,470
Speaker 0: I think that's why you look at like, what was that game with the, uh, the alchemy game?

1079
01:07:22,510 --> 01:07:22,632
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1080
01:07:22,652 --> 01:07:26,363
Speaker 1: The alchemy game, the codex of alchemical engineering is basically just doing the fun part of coding.

1081
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:27,556
Speaker 1: I mean, I enjoyed that game.

1082
01:07:27,596 --> 01:07:27,960
Speaker 0: Basically.

1083
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,298
Speaker 0: That's the epitome of what the fun part of coding is.

1084
01:07:30,621 --> 01:07:32,050
Speaker 1: Is that the epitome of a good game too?

1085
01:07:32,091 --> 01:07:33,440
Speaker 1: Because look, it was simple enough.

1086
01:07:33,540 --> 01:07:34,428
Speaker 1: You could brute force it.

1087
01:07:34,448 --> 01:07:35,839
Speaker 1: It was a game that anyone could play.

1088
01:07:36,361 --> 01:07:38,472
Speaker 1: And yet it rewarded mastery.

1089
01:07:38,633 --> 01:07:41,545
Speaker 1: If mastery was your goal, yeah.

1090
01:07:41,585 --> 01:07:55,037
Speaker 0: So that's, you know, that's the kind of code I like writing, but nowadays is pretty much like, imagine if you basically, it's like playing the codex of alchemical engineering with cheating pieces, you know, like, like, but they don't work just quite right.

1091
01:07:55,379 --> 01:07:55,600
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1092
01:07:56,022 --> 01:08:00,114
Speaker 0: But it's all, it's basically if you had that plus cheating pieces, well, the game becomes sort of boring.

1093
01:08:00,134 --> 01:08:02,979
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, I just take this cheating piece and I win this level up.

1094
01:08:03,221 --> 01:08:04,730
Speaker 0: Here's the piece that beats level two.

1095
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,420
Speaker 0: Oh, I need to beat level three.

1096
01:08:06,660 --> 01:08:07,847
Speaker 0: There's 10 level three.

1097
01:08:07,968 --> 01:08:10,180
Speaker 1: You'll have five pieces and they're all black boxes.

1098
01:08:10,422 --> 01:08:12,960
Speaker 1: And you put something in one side and do something to it and stuff comes out.

1099
01:08:13,201 --> 01:08:15,812
Speaker 0: No, you go on Google and you say, which piece beats level three?

1100
01:08:15,872 --> 01:08:18,109
Speaker 0: and someone says, oh, piece number four beats level three.

1101
01:08:18,130 --> 01:08:23,368
Speaker 1: But then someone else says, yeah, it only beats level three at first, but if you let it keep running, it randomly spits out salt.

1102
01:08:24,051 --> 01:08:25,319
Speaker 1: I just keep spitting out salt.

1103
01:08:27,384 --> 01:08:33,031
Speaker 0: That's cause it's something bad in that black box that you'll never look inside something bad in method.

1104
01:08:33,352 --> 01:08:48,676
Speaker 0: I think what I would just think anyone out there who was coding, you know, at the high level of gluing libraries together, my message to you is to just look when you're using something, let's say, you know, you're, you're writing something in, uh, you know, I guess, you know, try to use open source stuff.

1105
01:08:48,716 --> 01:08:50,106
Speaker 0: First of all, that way you can look at code.

1106
01:08:50,608 --> 01:09:01,091
Speaker 0: And then when you do use an open source library, let's say you use pie game to make a game, or let's say you use Ruby on rails to make a website, or let's say you use, you know, uh, Apache, right.

1107
01:09:01,173 --> 01:09:10,144
Speaker 0: To make a web, you know, something, go look at the code of the thing you're using, cause that will help you a get a better understanding of what your program is really doing.

1108
01:09:10,666 --> 01:09:10,908
Speaker 0: Right.

1109
01:09:11,671 --> 01:09:13,319
Speaker 0: Look at the code of Ruby on rails.

1110
01:09:13,621 --> 01:09:15,346
Speaker 0: Look at the code of pie game, you know?

1111
01:09:15,367 --> 01:09:21,920
Speaker 0: Uh, and then when you need to, don't be afraid to modify that underlying code because you know what?

1112
01:09:21,939 --> 01:09:24,139
Speaker 0: That underlying code is written by schmucks just like us.

1113
01:09:24,522 --> 01:09:26,399
Speaker 0: They're not some geniuses who are better than we are.

1114
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:29,560
Speaker 0: They're just other coders who decided to actually write something underneath.

1115
01:09:30,001 --> 01:09:36,756
Speaker 0: You know, if you have maybe like some of them are geniuses, some of them are, but even so, the code is probably, you know, it's there.

1116
01:09:36,837 --> 01:09:37,319
Speaker 0: You can read it.

1117
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:40,475
Speaker 1: The thing is geniuses, the code's probably really understandable.

1118
01:09:41,019 --> 01:09:41,220
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1119
01:09:41,461 --> 01:09:44,357
Speaker 0: And even then even geniuses, the code isn't perfect.

1120
01:09:44,698 --> 01:09:46,390
Speaker 0: You know, it has gotta be something wrong with it.

1121
01:09:46,591 --> 01:09:57,553
Speaker 0: Or you can, even if there's nothing wrong with it, you can probably, there's probably ways that you can modify that underlying code for your specific use case to make it a lot more useful to you.

1122
01:09:57,573 --> 01:10:06,102
Speaker 0: And in which case, do it because, you know, as opposed to writing a huge, you might as a write a huge block of code on your side and the outside of the black box.

1123
01:10:06,122 --> 01:10:12,589
Speaker 0: You could just write like one line inside the black box.

1124
01:10:12,609 --> 01:10:13,413
Speaker 0: that does everything.

1125
01:10:13,493 --> 01:10:18,054
Speaker 0: So why would you, you know, just cause you're afraid to look inside, you've written way more code than you need to.

1126
01:10:18,255 --> 01:10:18,659
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

1127
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,377
Speaker 1: Let's just return device.urandom add that to everything.

1128
01:10:21,518 --> 01:10:21,659
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1129
01:10:22,161 --> 01:10:31,668
Speaker 0: So look inside the black boxes when they're open source, fool around with them, learn how, you know, and then you'll be able to write your own libraries and maybe you'll write the next thing that everyone uses.

1130
01:10:31,708 --> 01:10:32,855
Speaker 0: That's like Ruby on rails.

1131
01:10:32,936 --> 01:10:36,900
Speaker 0: That'll be, you know, as opposed to just being the next user of Ruby on rails.

1132
01:10:37,160 --> 01:10:47,953
Speaker 1: I just think the key is to focus on the enjoyment part because if coders want to enjoy this one type of programming, as long as they know that it is like, it exists and they can still do it despite the glue.

1133
01:10:47,973 --> 01:10:50,311
Speaker 1: and the glue will still get done because that's where all the money is.

1134
01:10:50,331 --> 01:10:52,928
Speaker 1: The money's in the glue, the fun is in the rest.

1135
01:10:53,350 --> 01:10:56,139
Speaker 1: And as long as coders like to code, the rest is going to get done.

1136
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:58,758
Speaker 0: Now the thing is the money isn't actually in the glue, right?

1137
01:10:58,778 --> 01:11:00,246
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it depends.

1138
01:11:00,708 --> 01:11:04,526
Speaker 1: If you want to make between, you know, 60 and 110 if you want a job, right?

1139
01:11:04,586 --> 01:11:09,489
Speaker 0: If you are a gluer, you will probably get a job, right?

1140
01:11:09,529 --> 01:11:11,800
Speaker 0: That pays money like me and rim, right?

1141
01:11:12,220 --> 01:11:17,211
Speaker 0: However, if you want to make a product that you can sell, you want to make the piece that is being glued.

1142
01:11:17,271 --> 01:11:19,340
Speaker 0: Google makes pieces to glue, right?

1143
01:11:19,780 --> 01:11:26,217
Speaker 0: Django and Ruby on rails are pieces that you glue and those people who make these things are making mad bank, right?

1144
01:11:26,378 --> 01:11:32,492
Speaker 0: You know, through having consulting businesses or selling the product straight up or selling services associated with the product, right?

1145
01:11:32,915 --> 01:11:36,896
Speaker 0: So, you know, there is money in making the pieces to be glued, right?

1146
01:11:36,997 --> 01:11:39,089
Speaker 0: And there, you know, Twitter is a piece to be glued.

1147
01:11:39,169 --> 01:11:42,527
Speaker 0: Think about it that Facebook is a piece to be glued, not the glue itself.

1148
01:11:43,371 --> 01:11:47,780
Speaker 0: And there is jobs, you know, if you want to work for someone else in being a gluer.

1149
01:11:48,281 --> 01:11:55,425
Speaker 0: So there's money all around, but a lot more people make money being gluers than making, you know, popsicle sticks.

1150
01:11:55,527 --> 01:11:56,660
Speaker 1: There's no more demand for it.

1151
01:11:56,680 --> 01:12:05,923
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess when I say that's where the money is, is that 99% of what businesses need and what the economy, what everyone needs is two things that aren't glued together to get glued together.

1152
01:12:05,943 --> 01:12:07,960
Speaker 1: So that's always going to be where the money is.

1153
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:12,000
Speaker 1: Cause someone's always going to say, I want my sales force to connect to my blah.

1154
01:12:12,481 --> 01:12:18,877
Speaker 1: And then someone's gonna have to write some JMX adapter to or JDBC thing to like get the data, massage it and stick it in the other thing.

1155
01:12:19,078 --> 01:12:19,219
Speaker 0: Yep.

1156
01:12:19,781 --> 01:12:25,320
Speaker 1: And a lot of these things will get more and more custom as people, you know, internal, like I got to connect my particular sales force.

1157
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:30,025
Speaker 1: That's these weird fields to this particular ticketing system that has these particular fields.

1158
01:12:30,266 --> 01:12:30,407
Speaker 1: Yep.

1159
01:12:30,688 --> 01:12:32,577
Speaker 1: And that'll never be fun to do for anyone.

1160
01:12:32,959 --> 01:12:33,140
Speaker 1: Nope.

1161
01:12:35,563 --> 01:12:36,233
Speaker 1: I think that's good enough.

1162
01:12:36,253 --> 01:12:36,639
Speaker 0: That was good.

1163
01:12:43,180 --> 01:12:45,700
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

1164
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:50,518
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1165
01:12:50,980 --> 01:12:55,889
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

1166
01:12:56,110 --> 01:12:58,808
Speaker 1: Remember geek nights is not one, but four different shows.

1167
01:12:58,929 --> 01:13:03,573
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays and indiscriminate Thursdays.

1168
01:13:03,895 --> 01:13:06,740
Speaker 0: geek nights is distributed under a creative comments attribution.

1169
01:13:06,740 --> 01:13:07,884
Speaker 0: 3.0 license.

1170
01:13:08,306 --> 01:13:11,380
Speaker 0: geek nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1171
01:13:11,580 --> 01:13:14,479
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1172
01:13:36,012 --> 01:13:39,090
Speaker 0: And I purposefully didn't put chase Gordon in this meta moment.

1173
01:13:39,210 --> 01:13:40,929
Speaker 0: I was going to do him in the Wednesday, Wednesday.

1174
01:13:41,834 --> 01:13:47,770
Speaker 1: I noticed something strange just because the people pointed it out in this, you stream, you basically close your eyes while you're doing the show.

1175
01:13:48,011 --> 01:13:48,233
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1176
01:13:48,394 --> 01:13:49,000
Speaker 0: What am I looking at?

1177
01:13:49,020 --> 01:13:51,730
Speaker 1: I don't know, but it just, it kind of, it looks funny cause your eyes are just closed.

1178
01:13:51,850 --> 01:13:54,509
Speaker 1: You're kind of just like looking down like I'm doing geek nights now.

1179
01:13:55,011 --> 01:14:00,278
Speaker 1: I'm nodding and I'm acting like I'm talking to someone, but as a closed, yeah, I'm not looking at anything.

1180
01:14:00,882 --> 01:14:02,330
Speaker 0: If I was on video, I keep the eyes open.

1181
01:14:04,193 --> 01:14:06,890
Speaker 0: Well, you know, I think I kept my eyes open when we did the show the other day.

1182
01:14:07,532 --> 01:14:07,773
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1183
01:14:07,813 --> 01:14:10,610
Speaker 1: So, you know, see what you should do is close your eyes during a panel.

1184
01:14:10,690 --> 01:14:11,576
Speaker 1: Cause it's really unnerving.

1185
01:14:12,602 --> 01:14:13,306
Speaker 0: Why would I do that?

1186
01:14:13,366 --> 01:14:15,281
Speaker 0: Imagine that if I, yeah, I don't close my eyes during a panel.

1187
01:14:15,301 --> 01:14:17,870
Speaker 0: Maybe if we did a whole panel, I don't think I've ever closed my eyes during a panel.

1188
01:14:18,010 --> 01:14:19,097
Speaker 1: And we did close our eyes.

1189
01:14:19,198 --> 01:14:23,010
Speaker 0: Cause I always look at the back wall or I look at people in the audience or hot girls in the audience or whatever.

1190
01:14:23,150 --> 01:14:23,575
Speaker 1: What if we did that?

1191
01:14:23,595 --> 01:14:24,970
Speaker 1: We just, you know, we know what our slides are.

1192
01:14:25,030 --> 01:14:25,735
Speaker 1: We haven't memorized.

1193
01:14:25,755 --> 01:14:28,775
Speaker 1: If we just kept our eyes closed for the whole panel, we'd fall off the stage.

1194
01:14:28,815 --> 01:14:30,164
Speaker 0: You go, oops, trip over the wire.

1195
01:14:30,184 --> 01:14:30,767
Speaker 0: That'd be great.

1196
01:14:30,989 --> 01:14:33,190
Speaker 0: No, you can fall off if you want.
