1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,708
Speaker 0: It's Monday, September 20th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:09,909
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:13,498
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,243
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,284 --> 00:00:22,260
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about computer magazines and related ancient obsolete things.

6
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:24,757
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:28,960
Speaker 0: So yesterday, you know, it's Geek Nights.

8
00:00:29,561 --> 00:00:32,159
Speaker 0: Often people make fun of us because it turns into Bike Nights.

9
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:36,100
Speaker 0: Because in the beginning of the show we talk about what's going on in our lives and especially during COVID.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,594
Speaker 0: But for a long time before that, 90% of what happens in our lives that isn't part of Geek Nights.

11
00:00:41,674 --> 00:00:43,920
Speaker 0: that we would talk about is something to do with the bike.

12
00:00:44,901 --> 00:00:51,240
Speaker 1: You know, we should just make Bike Nights, like make a bike, put it in the bike category and hope to get bike sponsors.

13
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:56,240
Speaker 0: We could replace our least popular day with bikes.

14
00:00:57,781 --> 00:00:58,743
Speaker 1: We'll interview bike people.

15
00:00:58,763 --> 00:01:07,420
Speaker 1: Let's just do the thing that podcasts are supposed to do, which is just be a media outlet that takes ads and gets sponsors and interviews people.

16
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,627
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean the thing we avoided for so long?

17
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:13,540
Speaker 0: The reason why Geek Nights stayed at this very specific plateau of engagement?

18
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:14,802
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

19
00:01:14,842 --> 00:01:17,250
Speaker 1: Let's do the thing that you're just like a cookie cutter.

20
00:01:17,651 --> 00:01:20,059
Speaker 1: What a podcast is supposed to do.

21
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:23,172
Speaker 1: Just to get free bike shit.

22
00:01:23,212 --> 00:01:24,680
Speaker 1: Because right now it's hard to get bike shit.

23
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,426
Speaker 0: I was about to say, that is a good angle.

24
00:01:27,507 --> 00:01:32,558
Speaker 0: Because even with my contacts on the inside of some companies, nobody's sending me a 3080 right now.

25
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:36,300
Speaker 1: We have no contacts in bike companies.

26
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we could just make bike content.

27
00:01:39,644 --> 00:01:42,970
Speaker 0: So my idea was to revitalize.

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:48,159
Speaker 0: an idea we brought off and on but never committed to was having the Friday Geek Nights.

29
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:48,980
Speaker 0: that is not regular.

30
00:01:49,563 --> 00:01:53,039
Speaker 0: But whenever there's a Friday Geek Nights, it's some special episode that we made.

31
00:01:54,601 --> 00:02:00,054
Speaker 0: Like another topic, something that took research, an interview that was big, like a guest host.

32
00:02:00,334 --> 00:02:02,700
Speaker 0: We could bring that back and then occasionally do a Friday Bike Nights.

33
00:02:04,621 --> 00:02:06,044
Speaker 1: I'm only doing that.

34
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:07,747
Speaker 1: I would only suggest that.

35
00:02:07,767 --> 00:02:09,991
Speaker 1: I wouldn't even relate it to Geek Nights.

36
00:02:10,092 --> 00:02:14,080
Speaker 1: It would just be like the bike podcast with whatever.

37
00:02:14,241 --> 00:02:18,094
Speaker 0: Well the only way to go with our new website is to do the thing that our current website supports.

38
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:19,940
Speaker 0: but we've never used of having multiple shows.

39
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,450
Speaker 1: Sure, but we don't have to integrate it with our current website.

40
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:27,260
Speaker 1: We just make a brand new thing just to get free bike shit.

41
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,726
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I just want it to be in the same CMS because I'm lazy.

42
00:02:30,747 --> 00:02:37,940
Speaker 0: And also I would interlink the branding a bit just because something nice is pretty good branding.

43
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,280
Speaker 1: That would tarnish the brand though by having an ad thing.

44
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,889
Speaker 0: No, because we were very clear from the beginning.

45
00:02:45,411 --> 00:02:49,020
Speaker 0: Geek Nights will never have an advertisement in it ever.

46
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:54,880
Speaker 1: Right, so our website that says Geek Nights at the top actually has this other podcast on it that's not related to Geek Nights.

47
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,764
Speaker 0: Oh no, you link to it and it goes to a different URL.

48
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:58,186
Speaker 0: Bike Nights something.

49
00:02:59,429 --> 00:03:03,356
Speaker 0: We never said that the front row crew umbrella would never have ads.

50
00:03:03,376 --> 00:03:05,160
Speaker 0: We only said Geek Nights would never have ads.

51
00:03:05,401 --> 00:03:12,398
Speaker 0: Anyway, so Emily and I went biking and we biked to Poughkeepsie a couple times.

52
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:13,400
Speaker 0: This is about a 100 mile ride.

53
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:19,840
Speaker 0: So we decided to, because it's way more downhill coming back to New York City from Poughkeepsie.

54
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,060
Speaker 1: I mean honestly it is more downhill coming back but it's not significantly upward downhill either way.

55
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:31,227
Speaker 0: Well it's about a 1300 foot total climb going that way.

56
00:03:31,247 --> 00:03:37,256
Speaker 0: So coming back you climb about 700 feet but you descend about 1300 feet.

57
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:40,080
Speaker 0: So you have way more time when you're on a downhill than an uphill.

58
00:03:43,566 --> 00:03:45,475
Speaker 1: But that number of feet is a flat ride.

59
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,690
Speaker 0: Because when I do a real ride it's like alright.

60
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:50,358
Speaker 0: I climbed what, a mile and a half, two miles?

61
00:03:50,378 --> 00:03:50,499
Speaker 0: Okay.

62
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:58,680
Speaker 0: So we did the opposite direction partly because we have to decide where the two hour train ride is.

63
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:04,460
Speaker 0: And it's either in the early morning when I fall asleep on the train and then wake up fresh in Poughkeepsie.

64
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:15,720
Speaker 0: Or it's at the very end of a 100 mile ride and now I have to drag myself onto a train and if I miss it I'm fucked for two hours and get back to Grand Central at like 11 o'clock at night.

65
00:04:16,482 --> 00:04:18,651
Speaker 1: Alright so here for measure right.

66
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:21,000
Speaker 1: also this ride is also not a big climb.

67
00:04:21,741 --> 00:04:29,940
Speaker 1: I went from my house to up Bear Mountain on the west side then over the Bear Mountain Bridge then to Cold Spring and then took the train home.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:35,269
Speaker 1: That was only 78 miles total and it was 4,500 almost feet of climbing.

69
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:48,200
Speaker 1: And that's not a big climb so a thousand is basically flat.

70
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:55,360
Speaker 0: So anyway we do the bike ride and so the last time, I think I even talked about this on Geek Nights, we were up there.

71
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:04,160
Speaker 0: We biked to Poughkeepsie and we thought oh we'll bike over that bridge that goes over the Hudson and then we'll declare victory, bike back over the bridge and get some food and take the train home.

72
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:10,660
Speaker 0: And the bridge was closed for a private event with no detour and no way to get a bike across that bridge.

73
00:05:11,181 --> 00:05:21,980
Speaker 0: Despite the fact that that bridge is part of the New York State Empire Trail that is supposedly part of our infrastructure and the governor encourages people to use it for long bike travel.

74
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,300
Speaker 1: I haven't heard the new governor say anything about it.

75
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:25,369
Speaker 0: Well the old governor said it.

76
00:05:25,389 --> 00:05:26,559
Speaker 0: The new governor hasn't said shit about it.

77
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:31,959
Speaker 0: So they closed it for a private event which super fucks anyone who actually may...

78
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:35,247
Speaker 1: Also private event on public property is the only...

79
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,320
Speaker 0: In advance, I did look, I found their website for that bridge and I looked at it to see if there were any events that would block it.

80
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:53,618
Speaker 0: And the website said there is an event that blocks the bridge yesterday until 1030 in the morning.

81
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,956
Speaker 0: Which wouldn't have mattered because we weren't going over the bridge anyway.

82
00:05:56,976 --> 00:05:57,580
Speaker 0: but I just wanted to know.

83
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,059
Speaker 1: Why are there so many events on this bridge?

84
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:04,580
Speaker 0: Because the upstate New York is trying to capitalize on this giant infrastructure park project that they got.

85
00:06:05,526 --> 00:06:05,796
Speaker 1: I don't know.

86
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:07,587
Speaker 0: Local politicians strutting their stuff.

87
00:06:07,627 --> 00:06:07,989
Speaker 0: So whatever.

88
00:06:08,370 --> 00:06:10,540
Speaker 0: We get up there and guess what?

89
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:12,084
Speaker 0: Both directions are closed.

90
00:06:12,124 --> 00:06:16,300
Speaker 0: In fact, the entire Dutchess County Trailway is closed.

91
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:17,679
Speaker 1: For what reason?

92
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:20,938
Speaker 0: They were running... Poughkeepsie was running a foot race there.

93
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,487
Speaker 0: They closed the whole thing.

94
00:06:23,709 --> 00:06:25,240
Speaker 0: There were cops blocking the entrance.

95
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:27,553
Speaker 0: So we pull up and the cops are like, "You can't go in

96
00:06:27,573 --> 00:06:27,734
Speaker 0: there.".

97
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:28,600
Speaker 0: And they're like a little aggro.

98
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:29,951
Speaker 0: So I'm like, "Alright, is there a

99
00:06:29,991 --> 00:06:30,416
Speaker 0: detour?".

100
00:06:31,004 --> 00:06:31,186
Speaker 0: "No.

101
00:06:31,369 --> 00:06:31,491
Speaker 0: No

102
00:06:31,532 --> 00:06:31,938
Speaker 0: detour.".

103
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:33,154
Speaker 0: "Is there any other

104
00:06:33,195 --> 00:06:33,479
Speaker 0: path?".

105
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:33,864
Speaker 0: "Nope.

106
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:34,250
Speaker 0: No other

107
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:34,554
Speaker 0: path.".

108
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,668
Speaker 0: Where does the race end?

109
00:06:37,009 --> 00:06:37,953
Speaker 0: No one could tell us.

110
00:06:38,274 --> 00:06:39,018
Speaker 0: There was no map.

111
00:06:39,058 --> 00:06:39,540
Speaker 0: There was nothing.

112
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,973
Speaker 0: So now we're in Poughkeepsie, planning to bike 105 miles to Queens.

113
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:52,020
Speaker 0: And the only path that is good to go through that area is closed for an indeterminate distance for like four hours.

114
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:55,308
Speaker 0: There's no way to know this in advance.

115
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:58,380
Speaker 0: There's no unified website you can go to for this.

116
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:02,060
Speaker 0: Like a highway, if it's closed, by law, there's a detour.

117
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:03,719
Speaker 0: That's just how infrastructure works.

118
00:07:04,001 --> 00:07:10,700
Speaker 0: In Queens, if they close the bike path on the Queensborough Bridge because it's open 24/7, they run a shuttle to take your bikes back and forth.

119
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,119
Speaker 0: So you can still use it at 3am if you really want to.

120
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:27,000
Speaker 0: Yet this infrastructure bike path that goes from New York up to Poughkeepsie and ostensibly all the way across to fucking Buffalo, Shiddo towns can just close it without telling anyone for no reason and just screw anyone who happens to be on a long bike ride.

121
00:07:28,042 --> 00:07:31,120
Speaker 1: Well, I don't disagree at all with anything that you just said.

122
00:07:32,161 --> 00:07:42,740
Speaker 1: I do just want to point out, you know, this is somewhat of an apt punishment because you're so obstinate and only willing to bike on this one place and not biking anywhere else.

123
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,708
Speaker 1: You just come and bike where I bike.

124
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:47,280
Speaker 1: I never have these problems because I go on roads.

125
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:59,580
Speaker 0: Because we couldn't use the bike path up there, my plan was we took normal country highway roads, the ones you described, just like across and around to where we figured there's no way that race is that far out.

126
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,264
Speaker 0: And we were correct.

127
00:08:00,284 --> 00:08:03,059
Speaker 0: We actually got back on the bike path like right after the race.

128
00:08:03,301 --> 00:08:03,850
Speaker 1: Well, it's a foot race.

129
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,419
Speaker 1: How far could it be?

130
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:04,460
Speaker 1: 5k?

131
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,175
Speaker 0: There was a marathon that was part of it.

132
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:10,900
Speaker 1: Okay, but I'm sure the marathon wasn't, they weren't closing off marathon levels of track.

133
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:15,780
Speaker 0: I mean, even if they did, the direction we went, we can bike 26 miles on regular country roads.

134
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,640
Speaker 0: So we had numerous cars honk at us, freak out at us for being on the road.

135
00:08:21,161 --> 00:08:32,679
Speaker 0: And at one of them, the lady got so freaked out and aggressive that I videoed her and I even tweeted about it, chasing me, gunning her car at me, screaming at me and honking because I was a bike on the road.

136
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,142
Speaker 1: I don't have these.

137
00:08:34,182 --> 00:08:37,720
Speaker 1: I mean, that's definitely a thing that happens, but I have video of it that often.

138
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:42,179
Speaker 1: The last time it happened to me was the guy who was just, he wasn't actually angry.

139
00:08:42,361 --> 00:08:44,148
Speaker 1: He was riding in the bike lane, right?

140
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:46,779
Speaker 1: He wasn't angry yet until I stopped and prevented him.

141
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,051
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy.

142
00:08:49,361 --> 00:08:49,963
Speaker 1: Yeah, that guy.

143
00:08:50,023 --> 00:08:54,920
Speaker 1: So before that guy, I can't remember the last time somebody was aggressive to me.

144
00:08:54,960 --> 00:09:01,660
Speaker 1: And I think the reason is, you know, not only am I biking on roads, right, but I'm biking on roads with lots of cyclists, right?

145
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,340
Speaker 1: I'm biking on the roads that are popular with the New York cycling people, right?

146
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:13,756
Speaker 1: It's like they know where to go, the hot places, right, that are friendly, that have rest stops, that are, you know, businesses that are friendly, let cyclists come in and eat and pee, right?

147
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, but see, I don't want any of those things.

148
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,680
Speaker 1: I want a flat tire, 10 people stop and try to help you.

149
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,683
Speaker 0: See, I don't want any of that.

150
00:09:19,724 --> 00:09:24,380
Speaker 0: I really like solo travel and I really like to be able to ride on any road.

151
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,640
Speaker 0: Except, obviously, grade separated freeways.

152
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:28,077
Speaker 1: I mean, ideally.

153
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:36,359
Speaker 0: Though, in Australia, you can bike on the grade separated freeways because they have bike lanes because they're not a barbaric country like the US is.

154
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:40,120
Speaker 1: I was saying, you know, just giving things the way they are, right?

155
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:52,040
Speaker 1: Riding where it's popular with cyclists to ride is a good idea and you should be more open to doing that and come with me at least one time instead of just always riding on the same path every single time and not going anywhere else.

156
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,660
Speaker 0: So, how many times do you think we've ridden that ride?

157
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,700
Speaker 1: Like, four maybe this year?

158
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:56,981
Speaker 1: No, three.

159
00:09:57,183 --> 00:10:00,340
Speaker 0: Twice up and then we did once back just to see what it was like in reverse.

160
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:05,460
Speaker 0: But also, more to the point, I just don't- What other long rides did you do this year?

161
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,880
Speaker 0: Big ones around the city, like out to the Rockaways and around and back, that Queens Boulevard goes way out.

162
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,860
Speaker 1: But anywhere outside of the five boroughs that wasn't on that path.

163
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:15,460
Speaker 0: I hate biking on country roads and I avoid them.

164
00:10:15,460 --> 00:10:16,760
Speaker 1: But you haven't done it, apparently.

165
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,480
Speaker 0: No, because they suck and I hate riding on them.

166
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:24,618
Speaker 1: Maybe you should come and bike where it's popular with cyclists to ride outside the city where you've never been and don't know how it is.

167
00:10:24,658 --> 00:10:25,320
Speaker 1: That's all I'm saying.

168
00:10:25,641 --> 00:10:27,140
Speaker 0: Nah, I'm saying that doesn't seem worth it.

169
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,219
Speaker 1: One time, just come one time.

170
00:10:28,742 --> 00:10:31,060
Speaker 0: I did, on the Harlow County Rail Ride, which I'll do every year.

171
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,523
Speaker 1: That is not what I'm talking about.

172
00:10:32,564 --> 00:10:38,800
Speaker 1: I'm talking about going over the George Washington Bridge to New Jersey and then crossing the border into New York again.

173
00:10:39,541 --> 00:10:44,340
Speaker 0: The times I biked over there has not been super pleasant compared to a nice, lush, wooded path.

174
00:10:44,461 --> 00:10:46,415
Speaker 1: I think you just don't know where you're going over there.

175
00:10:46,435 --> 00:10:47,040
Speaker 1: You ever been on Piermont?

176
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:48,566
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the time.

177
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:49,250
Speaker 0: Just not biking.

178
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:50,840
Speaker 0: Biking around Bear Mountain sounds like it sucks.

179
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,362
Speaker 1: It doesn't suck.

180
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:52,803
Speaker 1: You should come.

181
00:10:52,863 --> 00:10:54,428
Speaker 1: It's very popular with cyclists.

182
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,675
Speaker 1: The terrain is much more interesting.

183
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:58,180
Speaker 1: It's much more hilly.

184
00:10:58,981 --> 00:10:59,303
Speaker 0: Hilly?

185
00:10:59,363 --> 00:11:00,269
Speaker 0: That doesn't sound like fun.

186
00:11:00,309 --> 00:11:01,940
Speaker 0: I'd rather be climbing and hiking there.

187
00:11:03,101 --> 00:11:03,324
Speaker 1: Okay.

188
00:11:03,365 --> 00:11:03,507
Speaker 1: Alright.

189
00:11:04,661 --> 00:11:05,940
Speaker 0: I go to Bear Mountain to hike and climb.

190
00:11:06,842 --> 00:11:10,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm climbing with a machine that makes climbing much more efficient.

191
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, and kind of boring.

192
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:12,795
Speaker 0: Anyway...

193
00:11:13,681 --> 00:11:16,108
Speaker 1: And, here, I can sell you on this.

194
00:11:16,389 --> 00:11:20,119
Speaker 1: If I'm trying to actually sell you on it, here's how I can sell you on it.

195
00:11:20,961 --> 00:11:21,948
Speaker 1: Big, fast downhill.

196
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:23,539
Speaker 1: Several of them.

197
00:11:23,840 --> 00:11:24,125
Speaker 1: Woosh.

198
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:24,897
Speaker 1: You get to woosh.

199
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,340
Speaker 0: There's plenty of those, actually.

200
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,660
Speaker 1: You get to woosh so much that I think it's dangerous and I'll go slow.

201
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,440
Speaker 0: Actually, there are plenty of those on the bike path to Poughkeepsie.

202
00:11:33,281 --> 00:11:34,125
Speaker 0: No, there are not.

203
00:11:34,165 --> 00:11:35,470
Speaker 1: I've taken the path to Poughkeepsie.

204
00:11:35,491 --> 00:11:37,700
Speaker 1: There are no wooshes like there are on the other side of the river.

205
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:39,754
Speaker 0: If you come back in the opposite direction, there are some ones.

206
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:42,045
Speaker 0: I've gotten up to 45.

207
00:11:42,045 --> 00:11:42,432
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean...

208
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,919
Speaker 0: I mean, granted, I get up at 45 going over the Queensborough Bridge, so...

209
00:11:46,941 --> 00:11:47,162
Speaker 1: Yeah.

210
00:11:47,182 --> 00:11:50,940
Speaker 1: You should see the steepness of some of these downs that are going on over there.

211
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,899
Speaker 1: Of course, then on the way home, you gotta do up.

212
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:53,450
Speaker 1: Yeah.

213
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:56,540
Speaker 1: Which is what I prefer, but, you know.

214
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:09,080
Speaker 0: So, in some news, there was a news back in July that we didn't really talk about and it escalated and it looks like the conclusion happened and there's updates, so we can speak about it now.

215
00:12:09,461 --> 00:12:14,420
Speaker 0: Partly because I forgot about it until recently and partly because we seem to know the full story, or at least most of the story.

216
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:25,960
Speaker 0: So there was a story in late June where people all over America, and possibly globally, discovered that if they had a Western Digital in my book, it was just deleted.

217
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:27,109
Speaker 0: All their data was gone.

218
00:12:27,554 --> 00:12:28,080
Speaker 0: Unrecoverable.

219
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,939
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, this happened like a while ago.

220
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:36,460
Speaker 0: So it kept happening and lots of people just lost all their data, got completely fucked by this.

221
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:47,516
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I have a little Western Digital passport, single magnetic spinning drive with a USB 3 cable, but I don't use it for saving stuff.

222
00:12:47,676 --> 00:12:49,920
Speaker 1: I use it for a big transfer.

223
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:59,600
Speaker 1: Or if I go on a trip, such that my SD cards need to be emptied, but I'm not bringing a computer with me, right?

224
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:06,680
Speaker 1: I'll copy the SD cards to it, then erase the SD cards so I can keep taking more photos and videos and filling that thing up.

225
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,540
Speaker 1: And then as soon as I get home, I empty that thing onto the NAS, which is much safer.

226
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:18,000
Speaker 0: So, in some updates, what seemed to be happening, like Western Digital, they gave advice to customers to unplug these devices or you're going to lose all your data.

227
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:21,025
Speaker 0: So, alright, something was going on there.

228
00:13:21,085 --> 00:13:28,440
Speaker 0: Could have been fucked up hardware, could have been firmware, could have been a bad update, like they pushed out an update to these devices, could have been hackers.

229
00:13:29,325 --> 00:13:30,377
Speaker 1: Could have been user error.

230
00:13:31,863 --> 00:13:34,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, so in this case, definitely not user error, even from the initial reports.

231
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,352
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, it's always a possibility.

232
00:13:36,373 --> 00:13:37,220
Speaker 1: I'm not saying that's what it was.

233
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,343
Speaker 0: It was just too widespread.

234
00:13:39,505 --> 00:13:45,560
Speaker 0: So, early reports were that it only affected people who used the Western Digital Cloud stuff, but then it was clear.

235
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:46,449
Speaker 1: I don't use any of that shit.

236
00:13:46,509 --> 00:13:47,320
Speaker 0: I treat it like a drug.

237
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:49,307
Speaker 0: Not using it did not protect you at all.

238
00:13:49,789 --> 00:13:52,760
Speaker 0: In fact, if you didn't set up any of that stuff, it could still happen.

239
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,511
Speaker 0: So, fast forward to now, there's an update.

240
00:13:57,772 --> 00:14:00,620
Speaker 0: I'll link to an article that was posted toward the end of June.

241
00:14:01,463 --> 00:14:02,920
Speaker 1: Someone tore one down and figured it out.

242
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:09,600
Speaker 0: So, basically, there were multiple things going on, and the story is way more nuts than you might have expected.

243
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:17,940
Speaker 0: So, people were assuming, there was a zero-day exploit in a bunch of Western Digital stuff, and people thought that's what they were exploiting.

244
00:14:18,642 --> 00:14:25,960
Speaker 0: It turns out there was an even older bug from 2018 that had just been unpatched up until 2021.

245
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:30,240
Speaker 0: Both were involved, and the long story... You can read this article that'll go into way depth.

246
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:31,610
Speaker 0: I'm not going to give you the play-by-play.

247
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:32,900
Speaker 0: It's just too long and complicated.

248
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:47,760
Speaker 0: But it seems like there's one set of hackers who might have done an inside job at Western Digital to get someone in Western Digital to comment out the code that checked that someone had provided a real password.

249
00:14:48,123 --> 00:14:49,899
Speaker 0: Before allowing a factory reset.

250
00:14:52,421 --> 00:14:58,160
Speaker 0: Like, there's a snippet of a code that someone commented out, and that just got distributed to all Western Digital devices.

251
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:13,940
Speaker 0: But, separately, it appears that a different hacking group, either to attack that first hacking group, or, as an unrelated consequence, went after the same devices and triggered the data wipes for unknown reasons.

252
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:19,963
Speaker 0: And this is a crazy complicated story.

253
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:38,860
Speaker 0: The only real takeaway I have for all of you is, never, ever, ever, ever, even though this wouldn't necessarily have protected you in this case, buy consumer-grade storage hardware and connect it to the internet in any way that allows you to access your data outside of your own home.

254
00:15:39,181 --> 00:15:40,578
Speaker 0: You cannot trust this stuff.

255
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:53,580
Speaker 1: Even my NAS, which is a pretty fancy Synology NAS, they're very trustworthy and such, the NAS has these features that let you access the NAS from far away.

256
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,280
Speaker 1: So that way you can send or get files to a friend.

257
00:15:57,022 --> 00:16:04,220
Speaker 0: Oh, my NAS can get out of my network to get to the Synology site to download updates and has no other access to the world.

258
00:16:05,141 --> 00:16:11,337
Speaker 1: Yep, and there's features that let you use Synology cloud services and things to integrate with your NAS and whatnot.

259
00:16:11,397 --> 00:16:12,660
Speaker 1: I didn't use any of that.

260
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:18,480
Speaker 0: Oh, no, my NAS can also connect to Amazon Glacier to upload my weekly sync backup.

261
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:26,773
Speaker 1: Sure, but it's like, yeah, my NAS doesn't have any more, there's no way to access my NAS from outside, right?

262
00:16:27,013 --> 00:16:27,875
Speaker 1: It's the same way.

263
00:16:27,895 --> 00:16:29,918
Speaker 1: you can't access my computer from the outside.

264
00:16:29,959 --> 00:16:30,780
Speaker 1: It's a one-way street.

265
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:39,797
Speaker 0: But more importantly, you have to have an offline backup of your data, because even the advice we just gave you might not have protected you from this Western Digital thing.

266
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:41,320
Speaker 0: Like, this is a fucked up story.

267
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,300
Speaker 1: Right, well, my NAS is the offline backup, right?

268
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:56,360
Speaker 0: Yep, but as in, you really should have, even if you have a NAS or a SAN, you should have another copy of that data, even if it's not refreshed that often, that is completely offline, as in, it is powered off somewhere.

269
00:16:57,703 --> 00:16:59,859
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess if it really needed to.

270
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:04,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, how I do that is I put it on Glacier, so there's an encrypted blob of all the data.

271
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,520
Speaker 1: Well, that's cloud, that's not offline.

272
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,239
Speaker 0: It is cloud, but it serves the purpose of an offline backup, because say, somehow, malware- It's not an offline backup at all.

273
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:14,420
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

274
00:17:14,681 --> 00:17:15,819
Speaker 1: It's very online.

275
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:20,209
Speaker 0: That's not what most professionals mean in Myspace, at least by offline backup.

276
00:17:20,230 --> 00:17:24,839
Speaker 0: They usually mean the data is inaccessible to the applications that use it and inaccessible to other systems.

277
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:30,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true, but it's not offline like a hard drive in a drawer that's not powered on.

278
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:34,114
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that is a somewhat archaic backup strategy at this point.

279
00:17:34,134 --> 00:17:35,820
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe consumers don't have a lot of data.

280
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,020
Speaker 1: Well, it could be useful for your most important shit.

281
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:48,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, what I do is the NAS just has it synced to Amazon Glacier, so say something got into my environment and wiped or encrypted all the data on my NAS and my hard drives and everything.

282
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:52,400
Speaker 1: It could get your Glacier credentials from the NAS and then wipe that.

283
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:55,090
Speaker 0: I don't think the way it set up it actually could.

284
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,339
Speaker 0: If they compromised my NAS to that degree...

285
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,040
Speaker 1: I guess it's not impossible.

286
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:01,893
Speaker 0: Yeah.

287
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:05,020
Speaker 1: But nobody can get into your hard drive in a drawer.

288
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,979
Speaker 0: I mean, that is true.

289
00:18:06,686 --> 00:18:07,960
Speaker 1: Hard drive in a fireproof box.

290
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:17,340
Speaker 0: Though, I have so much data on that NAS that the only way to have a completely offline local physical backup would be to have another NAS of the same size.

291
00:18:17,821 --> 00:18:18,770
Speaker 1: Yup, exactly.

292
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,779
Speaker 1: That's why I don't have one.

293
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,627
Speaker 0: Way back, we thought about doing that.

294
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:24,780
Speaker 0: We both buy the same NAS and agree to back each other up, but we just never bought it.

295
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,969
Speaker 1: If I had a lot of money, sure.

296
00:18:28,254 --> 00:18:29,138
Speaker 1: I could get whatever.

297
00:18:29,258 --> 00:18:29,559
Speaker 1: Anyway...

298
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,860
Speaker 0: But anyway, do not put all your stuff on one hard drive you bought from Western Digital.

299
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:39,136
Speaker 1: I think just don't use the net features of your NAS.

300
00:18:39,236 --> 00:18:40,380
Speaker 1: Keep your NAS on your LAN.

301
00:18:42,242 --> 00:18:51,480
Speaker 1: If you need to connect to get your files while you're out of the house, then you should mirror the files onto a service, like a Dropbox or a Google Docs or something like that.

302
00:18:52,401 --> 00:18:52,601
Speaker 1: Yup.

303
00:18:52,782 --> 00:19:03,340
Speaker 0: Along those lines, Western Digital had some other bad news in August, a little under a month ago, where they have some NVMe solid state drives.

304
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,070
Speaker 0: The ones you plug into your M.2 slot.

305
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:06,760
Speaker 0: These super fast hard drives.

306
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:17,920
Speaker 0: But they had a SKU, an SKU, a unique product that they sold, that achieved a certain level of performance, benchmarked by third parties to that level of performance.

307
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,780
Speaker 0: A Western Digital Blue budget SSD, and it was fine.

308
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:30,780
Speaker 0: Without telling anyone, except burying it deep in their update text, like a changelog that literally no human on Earth will ever read.

309
00:19:32,661 --> 00:19:40,020
Speaker 0: It looks like they changed the hardware to be slightly shittier, and they changed the firmware to drastically reduce the performance of these things.

310
00:19:41,022 --> 00:19:43,840
Speaker 0: And they didn't tell anyone, and kept selling them under the same model number.

311
00:19:45,544 --> 00:19:46,006
Speaker 1: Yup.

312
00:19:46,127 --> 00:19:48,459
Speaker 1: I think we've talked about this before, because they've done similar things.

313
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,099
Speaker 0: Oh, this has happened so many times.

314
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:55,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's been similar stories with this, with the shingled storage on the magnetic drive, something like that.

315
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:08,440
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, the shingled storage that is, for some kinds of consumers, doesn't matter, but for someone like us, is a fatal performance hit.

316
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:18,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like they keep doing this, and I really don't understand it at all, because all you have to do to avoid the bad attention...

317
00:20:18,705 --> 00:20:20,040
Speaker 0: Change the model number slightly.

318
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:25,380
Speaker 1: Just change the model number, you know, to something different, so that there's no confusion and no shenanigans.

319
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:29,160
Speaker 0: Ah, because you know, we both know, they are banking on that confusion.

320
00:20:30,722 --> 00:20:43,497
Speaker 1: Right, but it's like, anyone who cares and notices, right, is gonna... Right, it's like, you're not fooling them by not changing the model number.

321
00:20:43,538 --> 00:20:44,220
Speaker 1: You got caught.

322
00:20:44,421 --> 00:20:49,560
Speaker 1: Anyone who's smart enough to care and notice about it, right, is gonna catch you, and it's not gonna work.

323
00:20:49,940 --> 00:21:01,718
Speaker 1: And anyone who doesn't give a shit, because they're just like, I just need a hard drive for my computer, they're not looking up stuff like this, they'll just buy, you change the model number, fine, they'll just buy that new model number, even though it's crappier, they don't know

324
00:21:01,738 --> 00:21:02,280
Speaker 0: or care.

325
00:21:02,680 --> 00:21:04,560
Speaker 0: No, I've run into this with, so when I got my max mixer...

326
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:19,000
Speaker 1: You don't lose anything by making the new model number, but by trying to pull shenanigans that are so obvious and easily caught, just hurts you and makes people say, well, fuck you Western Digital, I'll go buy from someone else, because clearly you're just trying to be evil for no reason.

327
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:37,200
Speaker 0: So for both my max mixer and that DVD player that we bought, that I brought to RIT, there was a situation where the SKU was the same, but depending on other factors that you could try to suss out from the serial numbers, there were fundamentally different components that behaved differently in those devices.

328
00:21:37,661 --> 00:21:55,600
Speaker 0: And I remember, I was trying to get the Mackie mixer that was made after a certain date, because it literally just had more features for the same price, and there is no way to know which one you're getting, except by complete luck, or buying one used, and I think that kind of thing should be straight up illegal.

329
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:05,820
Speaker 1: Yep, I definitely think, you know, this is a thing that happens, you know, here we have Western Digital doing it for intentional deception purposes, at least by all evidence.

330
00:22:06,081 --> 00:22:07,509
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm considering their statement.

331
00:22:07,549 --> 00:22:09,760
Speaker 0: at the end, I'll read Western Digital's statement.

332
00:22:11,081 --> 00:22:25,059
Speaker 0: "For greater transparency going forward, if we make a change to an existing and internal SSD, we commit to introducing a new model number whenever any related published specifications are

333
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:25,620
Speaker 0: impacted.".

334
00:22:26,421 --> 00:22:28,460
Speaker 0: Props to the lawyer who wrote that statement.

335
00:22:29,501 --> 00:22:37,240
Speaker 1: Anyway, but here we have what appears to be intentional deception, but very often, this is just a thing that happens, right?

336
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:42,900
Speaker 1: Like, if you were in the 80s and you went to go buy Zelda 1 on a cartridge, there were like two different versions of that.

337
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:52,320
Speaker 1: At some point, they changed it slightly, and they didn't tell you on the cartridge that this is Zelda 1.1, or whatever the heck the number was.

338
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,920
Speaker 0: That just fucking didn't do macrovision, and I had an identical VCR that did do macrovision.

339
00:23:00,682 --> 00:23:04,098
Speaker 0: I would have paid a lot to get that non-macrovision one had I known that was an option.

340
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:10,477
Speaker 1: Yeah, and a lot of times you can look up online, you know, my Apple IIGS, right?

341
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:11,400
Speaker 1: It's an old computer.

342
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:19,316
Speaker 1: There are like several different board revisions for the Apple IIGS, like three, but if you went to go buy an Apple IIGS in 1986, or '87, you didn't know which one.

343
00:23:21,481 --> 00:23:24,396
Speaker 1: Apple didn't say, like, "Oh, Apple IIGS now, better, different

344
00:23:24,436 --> 00:23:24,757
Speaker 1: board.".

345
00:23:24,818 --> 00:23:25,260
Speaker 1: It's like, it was--.

346
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:40,340
Speaker 0: Well, in fact, these kinds of stealth updates, like, if a company is going to make a stealth update, even if it's for completely benign, normal reasons, if there's any difference in performance at all, they definitely really don't want consumers to know, because they definitely want to be able to sell all their remaining inventory.

347
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:46,078
Speaker 0: Like, look at Nintendo, people are like, "Ooh, I want to get the later Switch, because XYZ changes that--".

348
00:23:46,781 --> 00:23:49,988
Speaker 1: Well, Nintendo is telling everyone, right?

349
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:55,060
Speaker 1: So they're not, like, hiding it, so for them it's an intentional move where one costs more than the other.

350
00:23:55,962 --> 00:23:57,140
Speaker 1: It's not like the same price.

351
00:23:57,260 --> 00:24:12,299
Speaker 0: But suppose they didn't cost more, and there was no way to distinguish them, if consumers know about it, even if the change doesn't affect them, they will tend to want the newer, better one, just because, "Why get an inferior thing if I know for sure that they're

352
00:24:12,339 --> 00:24:12,580
Speaker 0: different?".

353
00:24:15,001 --> 00:24:19,260
Speaker 0: But Western Digital really just kind of has shit the bed on a lot of these issues lately.

354
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:24,870
Speaker 0: I will say that, other than my spinning disks, I don't use any Western Digital hard drives.

355
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:32,134
Speaker 0: I actually went full Samsung, because in the year 2021-- All my SSDs and M2 drives are Samsung.

356
00:24:32,194 --> 00:24:36,030
Speaker 0: My magnetic disks-- Mine are all Western Digital and my spinning disks.

357
00:24:36,230 --> 00:24:38,740
Speaker 0: They're all reds in the NAS, and they're blacks.

358
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:40,610
Speaker 1: I don't know what happened to Seagate.

359
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:40,992
Speaker 1: Who knows?

360
00:24:41,072 --> 00:24:43,768
Speaker 1: I gotta do research again to figure out-- We figured out what happened to Seagate.

361
00:24:43,788 --> 00:24:45,760
Speaker 0: We talked about it on Geek Nights, but I forgot.

362
00:24:45,963 --> 00:24:46,135
Speaker 1: I forgot.

363
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,063
Speaker 0: I also forget.

364
00:24:47,786 --> 00:24:51,180
Speaker 0: Finding Geek Nights from, like, 2008, and you'll figure out why Seagate sucks now.

365
00:24:55,491 --> 00:24:55,959
Speaker 0: Some other news?

366
00:24:57,061 --> 00:24:57,261
Speaker 1: Yep.

367
00:24:58,083 --> 00:25:10,174
Speaker 1: So, if you're from the UK, which I am not, but I've gathered from the internet and from other UK peoples, that in the UK, you know, gaming consoles were never like a big thing.

368
00:25:10,194 --> 00:25:11,880
Speaker 1: It was definitely a PC kind of place.

369
00:25:12,820 --> 00:25:21,180
Speaker 1: And they had, like, a different sort of, you know, the way that Japan has, like, a different PC history with things like, you know, the MSX and whatnot, and the FM Towns and all those things.

370
00:25:21,582 --> 00:25:23,719
Speaker 1: The UK had its own sort of PC history.

371
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:31,219
Speaker 1: They didn't have Commodore 64, Apple II the way we do in the-- I guess they might have had Commodore, but they didn't have Apple IIs, I think, the way we did in the US.

372
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:31,600
Speaker 1: so much.

373
00:25:32,122 --> 00:25:34,614
Speaker 1: The big thing over there was the ZX Spectrum, right?

374
00:25:34,654 --> 00:25:35,900
Speaker 1: Not ZX, ZX, right?

375
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:40,209
Speaker 1: If you don't know what that is, if you see a picture of it, you'll know exactly what it is.

376
00:25:40,269 --> 00:25:41,211
Speaker 1: It's a little guy.

377
00:25:41,231 --> 00:25:44,700
Speaker 1: It's like a keyboard, and you plug it into a TV, right?

378
00:25:45,421 --> 00:25:45,942
Speaker 1: And there you go.

379
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:50,135
Speaker 1: You got yourself a computer with a Z80 processor, and it was a lot of fun.

380
00:25:50,155 --> 00:25:51,599
Speaker 1: You get games on there and shit, right?

381
00:25:52,502 --> 00:25:58,200
Speaker 1: So the person who created that, it was, you know, it was the Sinclair, you know, ZX Spectrum.

382
00:25:58,761 --> 00:26:07,300
Speaker 1: And the person who invented that was Sir Clive Marles Sinclair, who passed away four days ago.

383
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,745
Speaker 1: So that's the news, right?

384
00:26:08,765 --> 00:26:10,009
Speaker 1: This important computing guy.

385
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:13,020
Speaker 1: I don't know if he was a good person or a bad person, because I don't know anything about him.

386
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:20,240
Speaker 1: I didn't realize that Sinclair was actually, you know, I'm completely honest, I knew that it was the Sinclair ZX Spectrum.

387
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:25,598
Speaker 1: I didn't know that there was a person Sinclair behind that until four or five days ago.

388
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:40,440
Speaker 1: But yeah, the person passed away at the age of 81, which is interesting, because that means Sinclair, when he was making these computers in the early 80s, and we were born, he was as old then about-ish as we are now.

389
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:42,996
Speaker 0: Well, it looks like he was doing radio kits in the 60s.

390
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:46,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, he was basically doing all kinds of interesting stuff.

391
00:26:46,727 --> 00:26:52,060
Speaker 1: If you look through his history, making like electric vehicles, little bicycles, right?

392
00:26:52,280 --> 00:26:58,936
Speaker 1: Watches, calculators, like, you know, very much in the vein of like the Dyson guy, right?

393
00:26:58,976 --> 00:27:00,700
Speaker 1: You know, making all sorts of stuff.

394
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:12,100
Speaker 1: But the ZX Spectrum specifically was just a huge deal, you know, just as far as personal computing goes, you know, around the world.

395
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:18,071
Speaker 0: The face he's making and the photo they put on this article, I feel like that's the face of a good person, but again, I don't know.

396
00:27:18,091 --> 00:27:21,798
Speaker 0: I'm sure I'm going to find out when I Google later, but I hope not.

397
00:27:21,818 --> 00:27:22,520
Speaker 0: I hope he's just cool.

398
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:23,701
Speaker 1: Yeah.

399
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:33,700
Speaker 1: So yeah, but it's like, the ZX Spectrum is just a really interesting thing, is that only ever having used one for like moments at a time here and there, right?

400
00:27:34,381 --> 00:27:40,000
Speaker 1: You look at it, and I have a nostalgia for this thing that I've never owned and it touched maybe twice for a minute.

401
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:46,060
Speaker 1: But you just look at it and it's like, oh, this black keyboard with these colored stripes on it.

402
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:53,676
Speaker 0: Well, because all those old computers, they remind me, like, there was an era in my life, because, you know, we were later, like the computer I had in my house as a kid was a 486 SX2.

403
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:59,385
Speaker 0: But there was that era where computers weren't connected to anything yet.

404
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:09,800
Speaker 0: And you could really just, as a kid, a computer was just a box of magic fun, but it didn't really matter what power or capabilities the computer had.

405
00:28:10,181 --> 00:28:12,486
Speaker 0: And the fact that you had a computer at all was a big deal.

406
00:28:12,587 --> 00:28:15,955
Speaker 0: So the ZX Spectrum, kids in that era, just fuck around with it.

407
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:18,080
Speaker 0: Learn a lot about computers along the way.

408
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:22,700
Speaker 1: And there were many, many choices too then, right, of completely different computers.

409
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:22,851
Speaker 1: Yeah.

410
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:27,774
Speaker 1: Not like, you know, by the 90s, it was like, okay, you bought a Compaq or an HP or a pack, you know, whatever.

411
00:28:30,221 --> 00:28:31,539
Speaker 0: Packard pal is what we had.

412
00:28:32,541 --> 00:28:32,821
Speaker 1: Yeah.

413
00:28:32,901 --> 00:28:35,747
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, or, uh, whatever you bought, right.

414
00:28:35,767 --> 00:28:41,840
Speaker 1: An IBM, you know, it's like, yeah, they were not the same, but they all ran DOS and Windows.

415
00:28:42,143 --> 00:28:42,385
Speaker 0: Yup.

416
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:44,920
Speaker 1: Like my 486 was- Unless you bought a Mac, that was different.

417
00:28:45,301 --> 00:28:48,816
Speaker 0: My 486 was not different from any computer anyone else I knew had.

418
00:28:49,378 --> 00:28:51,649
Speaker 1: Except- And that's how we're still in that situation today.

419
00:28:51,669 --> 00:28:53,840
Speaker 1: You're either buying a Windows computer or an Apple computer.

420
00:28:53,925 --> 00:28:54,060
Speaker 1: Yup.

421
00:28:54,621 --> 00:28:59,029
Speaker 1: In the 80s, there were a lot of choices that had nothing to do with each other.

422
00:28:59,109 --> 00:29:05,000
Speaker 1: An Atari, a Commodore, a ZX Spectrum, an Apple, some kind of IBM XT something.

423
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:05,799
Speaker 1: Yup, get a Tandy.

424
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:09,095
Speaker 1: All these computers were super, yeah, they were super different.

425
00:29:09,235 --> 00:29:10,160
Speaker 1: A Radio Shack Coco.

426
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:14,748
Speaker 1: It's like, uh, you know, a TRS-80 or whatever.

427
00:29:14,768 --> 00:29:20,460
Speaker 1: There's so many different computers, all with different chips, completely different software, completely incompatible in every way, right.

428
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:21,808
Speaker 1: You learned how to use one.

429
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:23,540
Speaker 1: You didn't know how to shit how to use another one.

430
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:24,584
Speaker 1: Nope.

431
00:29:25,467 --> 00:29:28,680
Speaker 0: And sometimes you had to know about the hardware to make these things work, like directly.

432
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:29,880
Speaker 1: Yup.

433
00:29:29,961 --> 00:29:34,886
Speaker 1: And especially in the UK, this one, you know, this guy made the one that was the biggest deal.

434
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:46,340
Speaker 1: So this is almost like, you know, if Steve Jobs didn't turn Apple around and it died, and then he died, that's what this is like.

435
00:29:46,761 --> 00:29:48,444
Speaker 1: This guy, he was the king in the 80s.

436
00:29:48,604 --> 00:29:51,089
Speaker 1: So it was Steve Jobs, but Steve Jobs was the king again.

437
00:29:51,149 --> 00:29:53,473
Speaker 1: This guy was not the king again, right.

438
00:29:53,593 --> 00:29:54,415
Speaker 1: And then he died.

439
00:29:54,495 --> 00:29:57,000
Speaker 1: So that's the level of this story that we're at here.

440
00:29:57,480 --> 00:29:58,462
Speaker 0: And one last little news.

441
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:00,586
Speaker 0: You might've seen us complaining about this on the internet.

442
00:30:01,547 --> 00:30:06,637
Speaker 0: To make a long story short, Google has a thing that they launched a long time ago.

443
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,320
Speaker 0: It's changed names a bunch of times.

444
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:14,280
Speaker 0: There's like, there's a whole, right now, right now, Dateline 2021 in September, it is Google Workspaces.

445
00:30:15,161 --> 00:30:22,069
Speaker 1: But, so yeah, originally the very first incarnation of it was called Gmail for your domain.

446
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:31,540
Speaker 1: And the way it worked was you have a Gmail account and you, instead of it being at gmail.com, you just want to change it to be at the domain you registered.com.

447
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:32,922
Speaker 1: So at front row crew.com.

448
00:30:33,542 --> 00:30:34,784
Speaker 1: So we signed up for it then.

449
00:30:35,785 --> 00:30:45,858
Speaker 1: And that's all it did in those days was just let you have at gmail.com and instead, you know, have a Gmail account, you log into google.com, but your email address is different.

450
00:30:45,878 --> 00:30:47,580
Speaker 1: That's the only feature it had originally.

451
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,005
Speaker 1: And then they kept adding to it, right?

452
00:30:50,045 --> 00:30:56,620
Speaker 1: So it was like a separate, special, different Google account that worked just like a regular Google account, but you could sort of administer it.

453
00:30:56,660 --> 00:31:00,005
Speaker 1: You could administer a group of accounts underneath your domain, right?

454
00:31:00,025 --> 00:31:03,691
Speaker 1: And they kept adding stuff to it, which wasn't always good and bad.

455
00:31:03,771 --> 00:31:09,520
Speaker 1: Sometimes it was bad because like you couldn't access regular old Google services with your special account.

456
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:11,046
Speaker 1: But eventually they sorted that out.

457
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,957
Speaker 1: You know, I remember there were a lot of stuff with Google Plus.

458
00:31:14,058 --> 00:31:14,620
Speaker 1: It got weird.

459
00:31:15,903 --> 00:31:19,160
Speaker 0: But they sorted all out and then they started unsorting it again.

460
00:31:20,041 --> 00:31:20,181
Speaker 1: Right.

461
00:31:20,201 --> 00:31:25,028
Speaker 1: Well, they made it Google workspaces or Google apps or whatever.

462
00:31:25,048 --> 00:31:25,468
Speaker 1: I don't know.

463
00:31:25,869 --> 00:31:34,280
Speaker 1: And basically they changed it into a product for companies because most people who, you know, would have a domain instead of gmail.com would be companies.

464
00:31:35,520 --> 00:31:41,530
Speaker 0: Because as much as you might be thinking, oh, but like the original use case, what if a family wants to have their own domain?

465
00:31:41,931 --> 00:31:47,840
Speaker 0: The reality is, imagine if your uncle Joey Jojo was the admin for your email.

466
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:49,180
Speaker 1: Right.

467
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:54,652
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of problems for families doing it because the admin can like read all the other priests people's email and share.

468
00:31:54,672 --> 00:31:55,474
Speaker 1: You don't want to do that.

469
00:31:55,794 --> 00:31:58,380
Speaker 1: Families, normal people can just use that gmail.com.

470
00:31:58,801 --> 00:32:01,205
Speaker 0: But Scott and I, like technology wise, trust each other.

471
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:04,531
Speaker 1: So there's other benefits.

472
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:04,831
Speaker 1: Right.

473
00:32:04,912 --> 00:32:06,074
Speaker 1: It's like something happens to me.

474
00:32:06,274 --> 00:32:06,474
Speaker 1: Right.

475
00:32:06,555 --> 00:32:09,620
Speaker 1: Someone can get my, you know, you don't have to worry about things like that anyway.

476
00:32:10,721 --> 00:32:15,300
Speaker 1: But yeah, if it wasn't for that, I'd probably be using your regular old gmail like everyone else.

477
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:19,540
Speaker 0: There was a long time where regular old gmail had ads and shit that I had never seen in my life.

478
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:20,561
Speaker 1: Yep.

479
00:32:20,761 --> 00:32:23,065
Speaker 1: Well, it still has ads and shit we've never seen in our lives.

480
00:32:24,026 --> 00:32:25,989
Speaker 1: So anyway, it's a product now for companies.

481
00:32:26,029 --> 00:32:32,880
Speaker 1: If you start a company and you want to get email addresses that they charge you like X dollars per user per employee at your company base.

482
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:36,265
Speaker 0: Like every convention you know about does this for their emails.

483
00:32:36,926 --> 00:32:37,427
Speaker 1: Exactly.

484
00:32:38,208 --> 00:32:45,260
Speaker 1: However, what they've always done, which is good of them in some ways, is anyone who was on the old thing got grandfathered in.

485
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,761
Speaker 1: So we don't have to.

486
00:32:45,901 --> 00:32:49,547
Speaker 1: we have this and we don't have to pay for it because we signed up for it when it was new.

487
00:32:49,587 --> 00:32:51,130
Speaker 1: There's no way we could sign up for it now.

488
00:32:51,551 --> 00:32:53,294
Speaker 1: We didn't start geek nights until today.

489
00:32:53,314 --> 00:32:54,536
Speaker 1: It would be impossible.

490
00:32:54,997 --> 00:32:55,297
Speaker 1: We could.

491
00:32:55,317 --> 00:32:57,000
Speaker 1: we'd have to pay per user to get it.

492
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:58,643
Speaker 0: Granted, I would probably pay.

493
00:32:58,824 --> 00:32:59,846
Speaker 0: There are a lot of benefits.

494
00:32:59,866 --> 00:33:01,149
Speaker 1: But we have a lot more users.

495
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:02,232
Speaker 1: So we have to kick other people off.

496
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:02,513
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

497
00:33:02,553 --> 00:33:03,194
Speaker 0: I would have kicked almost.

498
00:33:03,214 --> 00:33:05,640
Speaker 0: I would have kicked everyone off or made them pay us for the privilege.

499
00:33:05,941 --> 00:33:06,161
Speaker 1: Yeah.

500
00:33:06,241 --> 00:33:09,408
Speaker 1: It would just be like us to paying ten, five, ten bucks a month each.

501
00:33:09,508 --> 00:33:15,300
Speaker 1: I can't afford all the people we have on there and I don't think they would pay because it gets them nothing really.

502
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:21,990
Speaker 0: But the problem that happened is that as a result, this is my Google account.

503
00:33:22,631 --> 00:33:25,836
Speaker 0: And Google has started to fuck that up.

504
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:28,180
Speaker 0: Like Google pages does not work with these things anymore.

505
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,641
Speaker 1: Right.

506
00:33:28,661 --> 00:33:29,121
Speaker 1: So what right.

507
00:33:29,141 --> 00:33:30,323
Speaker 1: So what happened with Google Pay?

508
00:33:30,443 --> 00:33:35,410
Speaker 1: and to their credit, they only give you real tech support if you pay, which we don't.

509
00:33:35,871 --> 00:33:42,020
Speaker 1: So but I was able to get real tech support for the Google Pay thing because it involved money because your Google Pay.

510
00:33:42,401 --> 00:33:42,641
Speaker 1: Right.

511
00:33:42,701 --> 00:33:48,151
Speaker 1: So and they get the tech support person gave me straight answers, detailed answers.

512
00:33:48,191 --> 00:33:53,200
Speaker 1: And what they basically said was like, look, we had the old Google Pay and you could use that with your account.

513
00:33:53,781 --> 00:34:02,874
Speaker 1: But with the new Google Pay, we can't let you use that with your account because security wise, if you're controlling the DNS on that domain.

514
00:34:03,435 --> 00:34:03,655
Speaker 1: Right.

515
00:34:03,695 --> 00:34:06,960
Speaker 1: And you're transferring money from the email address at that domain.

516
00:34:07,641 --> 00:34:07,841
Speaker 1: Right.

517
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,163
Speaker 1: You could pull shenanigans.

518
00:34:09,704 --> 00:34:17,496
Speaker 1: So to prevent those shenanigans, we can only let you use Google Pay if you're at Gmail dot com and we control the DNS.

519
00:34:17,837 --> 00:34:19,840
Speaker 1: And I'm like, that at least makes sense.

520
00:34:20,380 --> 00:34:31,940
Speaker 0: Granted, it causes another problem of, OK, so now anyone using Google Pay and transferring money has to trust that that's the right specific Gmail account of a person because Gmail says that's always been a problem.

521
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,103
Speaker 1: That's a problem with all these payments anyway.

522
00:34:34,443 --> 00:34:38,329
Speaker 1: So as a result, we were happily using Google Pay.

523
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:46,159
Speaker 1: And now we can't use Google Pay anymore at all unless I use it with my non make another Gmail account.

524
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,103
Speaker 1: That's like a regular consumer one.

525
00:34:48,143 --> 00:34:48,344
Speaker 1: Yeah.

526
00:34:48,384 --> 00:34:51,949
Speaker 0: But then I have to have my phone logged into both of those accounts.

527
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:52,571
Speaker 1: Which is right.

528
00:34:52,591 --> 00:34:53,172
Speaker 1: It doesn't work.

529
00:34:53,212 --> 00:34:54,174
Speaker 1: It's a pain in the ass.

530
00:34:54,313 --> 00:34:55,155
Speaker 1: So it's a non start.

531
00:34:55,175 --> 00:34:55,877
Speaker 1: I have to use a different.

532
00:34:55,897 --> 00:34:57,199
Speaker 1: Basically, they kicked me off Google Pay.

533
00:34:57,219 --> 00:34:57,900
Speaker 1: I use something else now.

534
00:34:58,060 --> 00:35:06,895
Speaker 0: So then in September, September 7th, they did something where suddenly everyone, not just us, who had a Google Workspaces account could not access.

535
00:35:06,995 --> 00:35:09,940
Speaker 1: It seemed to be mostly the people who had the grandfathered ones.

536
00:35:11,142 --> 00:35:16,929
Speaker 0: So in my employer, we used Google Workspaces because we had Google Drive and stuff.

537
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:20,734
Speaker 0: And I couldn't go to Google News at work either.

538
00:35:20,794 --> 00:35:21,715
Speaker 1: It didn't happen to my.

539
00:35:21,755 --> 00:35:23,077
Speaker 1: in my employee is also.

540
00:35:23,137 --> 00:35:25,360
Speaker 1: we use that for but and I was able to.

541
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:25,760
Speaker 1: Yeah.

542
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:30,023
Speaker 0: And it seems like it slowly was affecting everyone, depending on when various caches.

543
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:37,690
Speaker 1: So basically, Google News, right, was if you had one of these accounts and you logged it and you tried to read Google News, it gave you this error.

544
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:51,080
Speaker 1: that said, hey, you know, you can't use Google News and go log into the admin feature, because basically, if you log into the admin of this thing, you can choose which Google apps you want to let the employees at your company use.

545
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:55,665
Speaker 1: You can be like, hey, the employees at my company, they can use Gmail, G-docs and Google Sheets.

546
00:35:55,765 --> 00:35:56,326
Speaker 1: And that's it.

547
00:35:56,446 --> 00:35:57,888
Speaker 1: You could you could do that if you wanted to.

548
00:35:58,348 --> 00:36:01,592
Speaker 1: You could also be like, you know what, if my employees want to use YouTube, go nuts, right?

549
00:36:01,672 --> 00:36:02,573
Speaker 1: Use everything you want.

550
00:36:03,073 --> 00:36:07,258
Speaker 1: But Google News was not one of the choices in that list.

551
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:08,700
Speaker 1: You can't turn it on or off.

552
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,801
Speaker 1: So they turned it off.

553
00:36:12,322 --> 00:36:14,223
Speaker 1: And so a bunch of people started complaining.

554
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:24,430
Speaker 1: And as a result, you know, one, there was the Google is like these Google groups, like forums, like community forums where you go for support because you can't get real support.

555
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:33,056
Speaker 1: And somebody who is, I guess, like, you know, mod there or something was like, hey, you know, what they said wasn't false.

556
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:38,320
Speaker 1: It was that, hey, Google News is not one of the apps that's part of the program.

557
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:38,820
Speaker 1: Right.

558
00:36:39,381 --> 00:36:46,640
Speaker 1: So the fact that it's not working is like, you know, hey, you know, use a regular Google account, deal with it.

559
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,004
Speaker 0: So that was a big fuck you to the users.

560
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:56,620
Speaker 0: And to their credit, before I even could write anything nasty in there, a lot of other people did tons of people writing nasty stuff.

561
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:57,562
Speaker 1: So I was under the years.

562
00:36:57,602 --> 00:36:59,908
Speaker 1: I learned, first of all, the person.

563
00:36:59,929 --> 00:37:04,300
Speaker 1: I think the person's problem was that they just weren't reading people's messages and responding accordingly.

564
00:37:04,862 --> 00:37:05,062
Speaker 1: Right.

565
00:37:05,103 --> 00:37:08,534
Speaker 1: They were doing a bad job where the Google Pay support person did a great job.

566
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:08,754
Speaker 1: Right.

567
00:37:09,798 --> 00:37:10,420
Speaker 1: But forget about that.

568
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:16,040
Speaker 0: Knowing what I know about the inside of Google, I'm not confident that real Google employees would have done any better, just to be honest.

569
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:16,921
Speaker 1: Who knows.

570
00:37:17,301 --> 00:37:25,935
Speaker 1: But forgetting that bad support person, I learned that a lot more people have these grandfathered free accounts than I thought.

571
00:37:25,995 --> 00:37:28,740
Speaker 1: I thought hardly anyone had it, but apparently a lot of people have it.

572
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:46,860
Speaker 1: Two, somebody suggested that the reason that these grandfathered accounts just haven't been blown away and we're still safe is because they suspect that several high profile Silicon Valley individuals have these accounts, which makes perfect sense.

573
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, because Google doesn't give a shit about us.

574
00:37:48,564 --> 00:37:53,740
Speaker 0: They could just turn this off and literally fuck us into the earth and there'd be nothing we could do about it.

575
00:37:54,361 --> 00:37:55,984
Speaker 1: Yep.

576
00:37:56,144 --> 00:38:02,154
Speaker 1: But it makes perfect sense that like, yeah, big time Silicon Valley people probably signed up for that shit in the mid 2000s when I did.

577
00:38:02,594 --> 00:38:02,775
Speaker 1: Right.

578
00:38:02,795 --> 00:38:05,820
Speaker 1: And they have a lot of clout and would not let go.

579
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:10,249
Speaker 1: And so Google would take a lot of heat from them if it were to shut it down.

580
00:38:10,349 --> 00:38:12,835
Speaker 1: And that is a plausible reason.

581
00:38:12,855 --> 00:38:13,737
Speaker 1: I have no evidence.

582
00:38:13,777 --> 00:38:14,699
Speaker 1: Just someone suggested it.

583
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:25,860
Speaker 0: But the thing is, if Google did shut this down, what I'm not confident they would do, because they're terrible at this, is they'd have to give people like us a path to turn one of these accounts into a regular Google account.

584
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:32,080
Speaker 0: But there is no even remotely plausible path to migrate away from one of these things.

585
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,729
Speaker 1: Nope, not at all.

586
00:38:34,073 --> 00:38:34,600
Speaker 1: I have backups.

587
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,140
Speaker 0: The entire Geek Nights YouTube channel.

588
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:41,257
Speaker 1: For you to turn those backups into something would be such a tremendous effort based on the format that they are in.

589
00:38:41,297 --> 00:38:42,260
Speaker 1: But I do have backups.

590
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:48,414
Speaker 0: The Geek Nights YouTube channel, my personal YouTube channel, which is also the Geek Nights YouTube channel, Scott's YouTube channel.

591
00:38:48,995 --> 00:38:51,060
Speaker 0: This is not stuff you can just move somewhere.

592
00:38:52,041 --> 00:38:52,201
Speaker 1: Nope.

593
00:38:53,003 --> 00:38:56,250
Speaker 1: At least not with any feature that Google exposes to the public.

594
00:38:56,631 --> 00:39:00,980
Speaker 1: And they don't give any support, so they don't expose it by phone or anything either.

595
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:02,103
Speaker 0: And it's endemic of just.

596
00:39:02,163 --> 00:39:07,400
Speaker 0: the real fundamental problem with Google is that it has too many things going on, too many product managers.

597
00:39:08,301 --> 00:39:09,780
Speaker 1: They do keep shutting stuff down.

598
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:19,020
Speaker 0: Well, because its internal structure is set up to like the people who have an incentive to build something new are the ones who seem to do better within the company if they launch something.

599
00:39:19,660 --> 00:39:24,540
Speaker 0: But keeping something running or making something that already exists better is extremely deprioritized.

600
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:26,966
Speaker 0: And it seems like it's mostly multiple.

601
00:39:26,986 --> 00:39:29,012
Speaker 0: people will fight over who gets to launch a feature.

602
00:39:29,674 --> 00:39:31,619
Speaker 0: And that seems to be how most decisions get made.

603
00:39:32,581 --> 00:39:37,435
Speaker 1: Regardless, it ended up just being some kind of bug because Google News was fixed within a day or so.

604
00:39:37,455 --> 00:39:39,280
Speaker 1: It was back online.

605
00:39:41,201 --> 00:39:49,900
Speaker 1: So the person in support clearly had no actual contact inside of Google because they would have found out that it was just a bug that was getting fixed and would have been able to tell us that.

606
00:39:50,440 --> 00:39:52,967
Speaker 1: But it was just as quietly as it broke.

607
00:39:53,127 --> 00:39:54,351
Speaker 1: It was quietly repaired.

608
00:39:54,371 --> 00:39:55,654
Speaker 1: We all can read Google News again.

609
00:39:55,674 --> 00:39:57,780
Speaker 1: So Google Pay is the only thing we've lost.

610
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,759
Speaker 0: But I still don't trust Google at all.

611
00:40:00,683 --> 00:40:00,823
Speaker 1: Right.

612
00:40:00,884 --> 00:40:01,626
Speaker 1: I still don't trust them.

613
00:40:01,746 --> 00:40:02,850
Speaker 1: And I have no choice.

614
00:40:03,372 --> 00:40:04,837
Speaker 1: And I still have said this before.

615
00:40:04,937 --> 00:40:05,700
Speaker 1: And I'll say it again.

616
00:40:06,541 --> 00:40:28,580
Speaker 1: If you have a website with accounts that public people can sign up for, there needs to be a law in place such that you have some sort of real human with real administrative powers who can be reached and communicated with by the account holders.

617
00:40:29,142 --> 00:40:29,342
Speaker 1: Right.

618
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:34,800
Speaker 1: Now, what that person might do when you contact them, right, is who knows what their policies are.

619
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:45,520
Speaker 0: I could hire someone for minimum wage to literally just say nope to anything anyone asks and just have an infinite backlog of unanswered emails and unanswered phone calls.

620
00:40:46,222 --> 00:40:49,320
Speaker 1: Well, there should be some limits on response time.

621
00:40:49,581 --> 00:40:49,943
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

622
00:40:49,964 --> 00:40:52,160
Speaker 0: I hire an army of people at minimum wage to say nope.

623
00:40:52,581 --> 00:40:52,781
Speaker 1: Right.

624
00:40:53,242 --> 00:41:01,719
Speaker 1: But there also needs to be, you know, if the if the accounts are essential to someone's, you know, livelihood, you know, business, et cetera.

625
00:41:02,180 --> 00:41:02,340
Speaker 1: Right.

626
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:08,119
Speaker 1: There at least needs to be mandated by law escape hatch of some sort.

627
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:16,060
Speaker 1: Well, especially with email, because email went from when we have email, but we have email backups.

628
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:16,761
Speaker 1: I backed up.

629
00:41:16,801 --> 00:41:26,100
Speaker 0: I don't know, but I'm saying email, but especially a Google email has become the de facto de facto single sign on for a huge number of people globally.

630
00:41:26,482 --> 00:41:28,797
Speaker 0: See, also Facebook single sign on.

631
00:41:29,601 --> 00:41:30,202
Speaker 1: Yeah.

632
00:41:30,583 --> 00:41:37,600
Speaker 0: But they become your identity online in a way that is not able to be I'm not even going to say easy to disentangle.

633
00:41:37,901 --> 00:41:40,318
Speaker 0: You just cannot disentangle that kind of thing at this point.

634
00:41:41,283 --> 00:41:44,700
Speaker 0: Like my Strava account is just fucked if I have a problem with this account.

635
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:55,380
Speaker 0: And because spam is such a problem, it's not like we could just make our own email service and redirect our domain we own to that because no one would accept emails from us.

636
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:58,320
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, so many people these days just aren't even using email.

637
00:41:58,540 --> 00:41:59,162
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

638
00:41:59,664 --> 00:42:04,299
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of people who don't have an email address that they use or that I could email them at.

639
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:08,960
Speaker 0: It's there's probably a Monday episode somewhere in that conversation.

640
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,580
Speaker 0: But anyway, anyway, things of the day.

641
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:15,243
Speaker 0: So check this out.

642
00:42:15,303 --> 00:42:19,660
Speaker 0: Now, full disclosure, I did not run the executable that comes out of this at the end.

643
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:24,720
Speaker 0: So I am trusting that it is not malware because it seems really cool and people have talked about it.

644
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:27,860
Speaker 0: But I'm just saying I did not personally go through these steps.

645
00:42:28,321 --> 00:42:35,518
Speaker 0: But this Twitter account tweeted four images of the old Doom shareware.

646
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,185
Speaker 0: Just Doom shareware.

647
00:42:38,233 --> 00:42:38,918
Speaker 0: They just tweeted it.

648
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:43,020
Speaker 0: And then they informed everyone that that was actually Doom.

649
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:46,580
Speaker 0: That you have a copy of the shareware, which they can legally redistribute.

650
00:42:47,061 --> 00:42:58,760
Speaker 0: And then they go on to explain that they use Staganography to encode all of the information necessary to recreate the entirety of the Doom shareware in those four images in the original tweet.

651
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:05,880
Speaker 0: And then they show you using command line on Linux step by step how to just turn those images into this software.

652
00:43:07,401 --> 00:43:09,939
Speaker 0: It's just an amazing, fun little thing.

653
00:43:11,121 --> 00:43:20,960
Speaker 0: It's also funny how the code, the entirety of Doom shareware is less than the size of one image I might upload to Twitter via my phone.

654
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:25,220
Speaker 1: You can fit the whole Doom shareware into four JPEG screenshots.

655
00:43:25,320 --> 00:43:27,185
Speaker 0: Not even four JPEG screenshots.

656
00:43:27,687 --> 00:43:32,520
Speaker 0: The lower four bits of the pixels of those screenshots.

657
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:34,515
Speaker 1: Right, so less than the whole screen.

658
00:43:34,596 --> 00:43:34,820
Speaker 1: Anyway.

659
00:43:35,141 --> 00:43:36,340
Speaker 1: Anyway, so what do you got?

660
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,020
Speaker 1: So the Internet Archive, you know, is a place that has all kinds of good stuff.

661
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:49,238
Speaker 1: But I feel like, you know, well, people who know about the Internet Archive and believe in it and support it rarely use it.

662
00:43:50,022 --> 00:43:51,559
Speaker 1: Partly because searching is kind of slow.

663
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:54,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, like unless I'm researching something specific.

664
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:00,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there are really treasure troves of amazing stuff on there.

665
00:44:01,082 --> 00:44:06,139
Speaker 1: But the problem is, is you have to, like, think to know that, like, I could go and get that there.

666
00:44:06,199 --> 00:44:06,500
Speaker 1: I could.

667
00:44:06,561 --> 00:44:07,360
Speaker 1: And that would be amazing.

668
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:13,760
Speaker 1: So I stumbled today upon one of the collections in the Internet Archive.

669
00:44:14,020 --> 00:44:19,700
Speaker 1: Much like it's almost like walking around a library and going into a door and finding out that they have a collection of, you know, whatever.

670
00:44:19,902 --> 00:44:20,999
Speaker 1: Right, that you didn't know was there.

671
00:44:22,001 --> 00:44:28,900
Speaker 1: So there is a collection of exactly what induced us to make today's episode about computing magazines.

672
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:36,300
Speaker 1: This specific old computing magazine called Computist, AKA Hardcore Computist.

673
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:40,669
Speaker 1: It's had a few different names, but this is an old magazine from the 80s.

674
00:44:42,563 --> 00:44:45,620
Speaker 1: And most it's mostly an Apple to related magazine.

675
00:44:46,481 --> 00:44:53,618
Speaker 1: But most of the content of the magazine is talking about your dad's around.

676
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:54,985
Speaker 0: I know.

677
00:44:55,146 --> 00:44:56,819
Speaker 0: I know what Computist was all about.

678
00:44:57,465 --> 00:44:59,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, talking about ways.

679
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,826
Speaker 0: You want me to read one of the entries?

680
00:45:00,906 --> 00:45:04,600
Speaker 0: Like, I just pulled up a random article from a random one from 1984.

681
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:07,580
Speaker 0: Hardick issue 12.

682
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:13,500
Speaker 1: To take copy protected softwares and remove the copy protecting part.

683
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:17,218
Speaker 0: So this article is called "Backup for Sabotage" by Clay Harrell.

684
00:45:18,521 --> 00:45:19,340
Speaker 0: Let's list some requirements.

685
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:22,116
Speaker 0: Sabotage was a game that I played on my Apple.

686
00:45:22,136 --> 00:45:22,700
Speaker 0: blah, blah, blah.

687
00:45:23,162 --> 00:45:26,480
Speaker 0: The last time I tried to play it, I noticed the original disc because I have overtime loading.

688
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:27,263
Speaker 0: Blah, blah, blah.

689
00:45:27,484 --> 00:45:30,079
Speaker 0: Here's the crack to make it work if you don't want to pay for it.

690
00:45:30,860 --> 00:45:31,321
Speaker 1: Exactly.

691
00:45:31,903 --> 00:45:36,194
Speaker 1: So it's like, there was an issue that was like, it has like Ultima 4 and Castle Wolfenstein.

692
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:39,986
Speaker 1: And it's like, yeah, here's what you do.

693
00:45:40,368 --> 00:45:42,960
Speaker 1: Take the floppy disk, copy it to another floppy disk.

694
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:44,799
Speaker 1: Go to the copy, do this.

695
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:47,459
Speaker 0: Like open this executable file, change these bytes.

696
00:45:48,922 --> 00:45:54,240
Speaker 1: Type in these commands, do this with this software tool that you have, that we assume you have because you're doing this a lot.

697
00:45:55,203 --> 00:45:56,639
Speaker 1: Do these things and there you go.

698
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:06,160
Speaker 1: You now have a version of Ultima 4 that you can copy all you want and play all you want without having to deal with any, you know, anti-piracy stuff.

699
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,900
Speaker 1: It's just, you know, completely unlocked.

700
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:14,660
Speaker 0: I will never not remind people that when I was getting into computing in the early days, I did not know that piracy was a thing.

701
00:46:14,921 --> 00:46:15,750
Speaker 0: And I just was like, oh, software.

702
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:17,358
Speaker 1: I didn't understand it either.

703
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,935
Speaker 1: A copy of software.

704
00:46:19,117 --> 00:46:19,319
Speaker 1: Cool.

705
00:46:19,740 --> 00:46:23,979
Speaker 1: I saw those messages and I didn't really understand what they were talking about.

706
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,920
Speaker 0: The first game I ever installed on my computer, Scorsher, the second game, Scorsher was the first game.

707
00:46:31,683 --> 00:46:37,580
Speaker 1: The first I had Wolfenstein 3D on a three and a half inch floppy that just somebody had scrawled Wolfenstein 3D on the label.

708
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:41,078
Speaker 0: No, someone at school handed me a disk and on it was Stunts 4D Racing.

709
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:47,080
Speaker 0: And when I launched it, a splash screen appeared that said "Cracked by Killifits" and then the game just worked.

710
00:46:47,560 --> 00:46:55,400
Speaker 0: Years later, I discovered that that was not in the actual game and that was in fact the hack that was used so it could be redistributed.

711
00:46:56,521 --> 00:46:59,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know, this magazine is, you know, has other things in it too.

712
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:02,700
Speaker 1: But it's really, really interesting stuff.

713
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:03,365
Speaker 1: Really cool.

714
00:47:03,385 --> 00:47:04,839
Speaker 1: A lot of fun to look through this.

715
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:13,399
Speaker 1: But also there's other old computer magazines out there, you know, and the best ones are the ones that have, like, you know, basically just code that you can read.

716
00:47:15,100 --> 00:47:17,877
Speaker 1: So look for those on here as well and have yourself a good old time.

717
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:22,160
Speaker 1: You can make that like your only nerdery, just like reading old computer magazines.

718
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:24,420
Speaker 1: There are so many of them, oh my god.

719
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:30,740
Speaker 0: Alright, so in the meta moment, the Geekless Book Club book, which we are both reading still to finish now.

720
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,598
Speaker 1: I'm making progresses.

721
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,640
Speaker 0: The Tale of Genji, not just a novel, but the first novel.

722
00:47:37,283 --> 00:47:40,760
Speaker 1: The first novel written by human beings that we know about ever.

723
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:41,721
Speaker 0: Yep.

724
00:47:41,761 --> 00:47:51,000
Speaker 0: What's interesting is as I get further along, I'm hitting a point where my opinion of the book and the things I have to say are not changing further.

725
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:54,198
Speaker 1: Like it's falling into some- I'm getting better at reading it.

726
00:47:54,440 --> 00:47:54,962
Speaker 1: That is true.

727
00:47:54,982 --> 00:48:00,520
Speaker 0: I'm getting more used to, like, who's who or at least not getting hung up on, like, wait, where the fuck are we now?

728
00:48:01,502 --> 00:48:01,567
Speaker 1: Yep.

729
00:48:02,861 --> 00:48:07,840
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we're still not going to cons until they don't need to require masks anymore.

730
00:48:08,525 --> 00:48:09,618
Speaker 0: So stay tuned for what we do.

731
00:48:10,100 --> 00:48:14,260
Speaker 0: I'm working on a couple of panels that maybe I'll just make or will make and just do online.

732
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,700
Speaker 0: There'll be some online cons that have online content.

733
00:48:17,560 --> 00:48:19,880
Speaker 0: Our last PAX panel is just on YouTube, Atari Game Design.

734
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,780
Speaker 0: You can just watch it in all of its glory from PAX East Online 2021.

735
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:26,620
Speaker 0: I think the Game Devs of Color Expo is coming up this week.

736
00:48:26,980 --> 00:48:28,300
Speaker 0: There's going to be real good content.

737
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:28,985
Speaker 1: This weekend, yeah.

738
00:48:29,005 --> 00:48:30,600
Speaker 1: It already starts on Thursday, I think.

739
00:48:30,721 --> 00:48:32,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, real good content at GDOC.

740
00:48:34,043 --> 00:48:35,799
Speaker 0: Like, better talks than I typically see.

741
00:48:35,981 --> 00:48:36,679
Speaker 1: I got my ticket.

742
00:48:37,041 --> 00:48:38,239
Speaker 0: At PAX's and such.

743
00:48:39,201 --> 00:48:40,478
Speaker 0: And let's just get right into it.

744
00:48:41,444 --> 00:48:43,139
Speaker 0: So, computer magazines.

745
00:48:44,340 --> 00:48:57,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, so back in the day, even, you know, if you had a computer, even when there was internet, you know, in the 90s, early 2000s even, you know, the internet was- people weren't just publishing all their content on the internet.

746
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,480
Speaker 0: No, there was not a lot of content on the internet.

747
00:48:59,541 --> 00:49:01,080
Speaker 0: You couldn't buy things on the internet.

748
00:49:01,300 --> 00:49:08,240
Speaker 0: And a lot of times, most of the websites you go to until a way later year than you think were just made by some random person.

749
00:49:09,121 --> 00:49:14,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like today where every single article in the paper New York Times is also at NYTimes.com, right?

750
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,520
Speaker 1: The New York Times is like, you know, we don't want to do that.

751
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:19,280
Speaker 1: That's obviously a bad idea, right?

752
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:27,960
Speaker 1: So, and they were trying to preserve their existing, which they're still doing even today, but they were trying way harder then to preserve their existing media.

753
00:49:28,081 --> 00:49:37,440
Speaker 0: Like before there was, you know- Fark didn't even appear until like the year 2000, so it's not like you could look stuff up online very much either.

754
00:49:39,021 --> 00:49:49,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, so magazines were still a huge deal in terms of getting content, especially, you know, journalism that was of a specialized nature, right?

755
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,480
Speaker 1: Because, you know, the journalism that you had access to was the newspaper, which was for a mass audience.

756
00:49:54,981 --> 00:50:02,460
Speaker 1: And you wouldn't find things in the newspaper that would give you detailed information about something specific in a niche, right?

757
00:50:02,460 --> 00:50:05,814
Speaker 1: You would go to the bookstore because how many magazines did they have?

758
00:50:05,935 --> 00:50:07,080
Speaker 1: if you're in a suburb, right?

759
00:50:07,761 --> 00:50:14,420
Speaker 1: You know, the only magazines you can get regularly at a newsstand would be like, you know, Time, you know, Life, Sports Illustrated.

760
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:21,820
Speaker 0: At least we spent a lot of time in mall bookstores and like places where there was the magazine rack and there was always a big computer section.

761
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:27,740
Speaker 1: Right, mall bookstore and library were the places that had all the magazines, right?

762
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:33,276
Speaker 1: The regular newsstand only had the, you know, the kind that you see in the barbershop, right?

763
00:50:33,316 --> 00:50:34,700
Speaker 1: Or the doctor's waiting room.

764
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:45,720
Speaker 0: There was nowhere to learn about computers unless you were going to school, knew somebody who was actively teaching you, or primarily reading either these magazines or the underground zines.

765
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:48,780
Speaker 1: Yup, or you had internet and were on BVS's.

766
00:50:49,460 --> 00:50:56,840
Speaker 0: Yup, but even then those BVS's, that was more of a crapshoot of good information compared to the curated collection.

767
00:50:57,020 --> 00:51:06,660
Speaker 0: Like the big deal with computer magazines, especially in the 80s through the like mid 2000s, was that each one curated a different type of content.

768
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:12,759
Speaker 0: Like Scott just alluded to with this thing of the day, that magazine had mostly how to crack stuff content.

769
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:20,520
Speaker 0: But like PC Gamer versus Maximum PC versus PC World, they all had very different types of content.

770
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:29,440
Speaker 0: So depending on what area of computing you were interested in, they were almost like the digest way to learn about the current state of the art of that area.

771
00:51:30,821 --> 00:51:32,689
Speaker 0: It's weird to talk about the pre-internet world.

772
00:51:33,051 --> 00:51:35,180
Speaker 0: It's so radically different from how I live today.

773
00:51:36,101 --> 00:51:36,262
Speaker 1: Yup.

774
00:51:37,124 --> 00:51:42,300
Speaker 1: So let's talk about, I'm just going to go through some of the magazines that I personally had experience with.

775
00:51:42,580 --> 00:51:50,420
Speaker 1: So the one I had a lot of experience with that I was subscribed to for about a year, but also bought off the stand a few times, was Computer Shopper.

776
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:51,720
Speaker 1: And Computer Shopper was a weird name.

777
00:51:51,761 --> 00:51:53,200
Speaker 0: Oh, I forgot about Computer Shopper!

778
00:51:54,020 --> 00:51:59,960
Speaker 1: So Computer Shopper stood out, in the 90s especially, because it was fucking enormous.

779
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:05,880
Speaker 1: We're talking like it's as thick and sort of on the same paper as like a Shonen Jump, right?

780
00:52:06,341 --> 00:52:11,620
Speaker 1: That cheap, cheap paper, but it was really thin, like even thinner than Shonen Jump paper.

781
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:14,760
Speaker 1: It was in color actually, quite a bit of it, not all of it.

782
00:52:15,441 --> 00:52:17,900
Speaker 1: And it was mega thick and it was big.

783
00:52:18,521 --> 00:52:20,432
Speaker 1: And it was in its own special thing.

784
00:52:20,472 --> 00:52:21,760
Speaker 1: It couldn't go on the regular stand.

785
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:25,580
Speaker 1: It would be like in its own metal bin full of Computer Shopper.

786
00:52:25,802 --> 00:52:26,507
Speaker 1: And it was cheap.

787
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,020
Speaker 1: It was like a couple bucks.

788
00:52:29,823 --> 00:52:30,508
Speaker 1: And you bought it.

789
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:32,360
Speaker 1: And of course, why was it so cheap?

790
00:52:32,820 --> 00:52:35,052
Speaker 1: Because it was hundreds of pages, mostly ads.

791
00:52:35,354 --> 00:52:36,400
Speaker 1: Almost all ads.

792
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,422
Speaker 1: 99% ads.

793
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:39,804
Speaker 0: It was an era.

794
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:42,720
Speaker 0: It's fascinating because you'll see this if you look at old newspapers.

795
00:52:44,042 --> 00:52:51,319
Speaker 0: Like old, old timey advertising was often just a list of features and benefits of a product and then a way to buy it.

796
00:52:52,220 --> 00:52:52,738
Speaker 0: Like that was it.

797
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:58,720
Speaker 0: So a lot of the ads that I remember from Computer Shopper were, while they were ads, it was a different time.

798
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,424
Speaker 0: And they were directly informative.

799
00:53:00,484 --> 00:53:06,259
Speaker 0: Like I learned a lot about RAM and shit from reading Computer Shopper and like the ads in it.

800
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:12,680
Speaker 1: So mixed in with the ads in the front part of the Computer Shopper would be your typical like review type stuff.

801
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,393
Speaker 1: Like, oh, this new video card, let's talk about it, right?

802
00:53:15,433 --> 00:53:16,680
Speaker 1: Hardware, that kind of stuff.

803
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,260
Speaker 1: You know, the same stuff you might see on tomshardware.com.

804
00:53:19,320 --> 00:53:22,980
Speaker 0: Granted, for a lot of the time I was reading Computer Shopper, there weren't video cards, really.

805
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:24,644
Speaker 1: That's true enough, right?

806
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:41,960
Speaker 1: But then in the back, for some reason, I guess I don't know what its history was, but they were like preserving the history of the magazine in this tiny black and white section in the back where they had like these weird, quirky Alice and Bob articles that would be more at home in something like The Computist, right?

807
00:53:42,362 --> 00:53:43,779
Speaker 1: Or a Dragon Magazine kind of deal.

808
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:45,499
Speaker 0: I forgot all about Alice and Bob.

809
00:53:45,660 --> 00:53:45,881
Speaker 0: Right.

810
00:53:46,383 --> 00:53:46,624
Speaker 1: Yeah.

811
00:53:46,825 --> 00:53:50,380
Speaker 1: So they had this quirky little area in the back that they just kept preserving.

812
00:53:51,441 --> 00:53:52,425
Speaker 1: I stopped reading it.

813
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:55,396
Speaker 1: It became a smaller magazine and a thinner one at some point.

814
00:53:55,436 --> 00:53:56,420
Speaker 1: And then I'm pretty sure it died.

815
00:53:56,561 --> 00:53:57,227
Speaker 0: I didn't read it.

816
00:53:57,549 --> 00:53:58,639
Speaker 0: Like I would read it like...

817
00:53:58,820 --> 00:54:00,975
Speaker 1: I never read one that wasn't a big fat one.

818
00:54:00,995 --> 00:54:01,035
Speaker 1: So...

819
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:01,790
Speaker 0: Yeah.

820
00:54:02,820 --> 00:54:12,040
Speaker 1: And I never got... And basically the thing is that magazine, despite being mostly ads, taught me, right, indirectly how to build a computer.

821
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:18,580
Speaker 1: I built my first computer by looking at Computer Shopper and using just common sense.

822
00:54:18,780 --> 00:54:22,900
Speaker 1: Like I see a picture of RAM and I see... I finally can see a picture of a motherboard.

823
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:26,260
Speaker 1: That's probably the first time I ever saw a PC motherboard, right?

824
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:29,839
Speaker 1: And I saw... Well, no, I guess I opened up the IBM and saw it in there, but...

825
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:30,958
Speaker 0: Yeah, for me.

826
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:36,740
Speaker 1: I saw the picture... I saw a picture of a motherboard and I saw what RAM looked like and I saw all the different things they were selling.

827
00:54:36,800 --> 00:54:38,165
Speaker 1: They were selling power supplies.

828
00:54:38,205 --> 00:54:42,920
Speaker 1: They were selling, you know, like hard drives and I saw the things, pictures of them.

829
00:54:43,601 --> 00:54:48,220
Speaker 1: And I could... I was able to figure out from that, like, this is what I need to make a computer.

830
00:54:48,561 --> 00:54:48,822
Speaker 0: Yeah.

831
00:54:48,962 --> 00:54:53,360
Speaker 0: I even would look at... There was an ad for a computer and it listed all the components of the computers.

832
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:55,940
Speaker 0: Now I knew what things I had to buy to make my own computer.

833
00:54:56,381 --> 00:54:59,931
Speaker 1: And one of the companies that had an ad in there was TC Computer.

834
00:54:59,951 --> 00:55:03,340
Speaker 1: I don't think they exist anymore, which stood for Treasure Chest Computer.

835
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:11,500
Speaker 1: And I went to their website and with the combined with the magazine and their website and the ads, I bought the parts for my first computer.

836
00:55:12,081 --> 00:55:16,580
Speaker 1: They actually sent me the 8-bit motherboard with the Pentium 3 already in it.

837
00:55:16,721 --> 00:55:18,859
Speaker 1: So I didn't have to do that part, but I had to do everything else.

838
00:55:19,481 --> 00:55:21,088
Speaker 1: And I got all these parts.

839
00:55:21,209 --> 00:55:23,760
Speaker 1: I got the right parts successfully.

840
00:55:24,341 --> 00:55:30,420
Speaker 1: And then I figured out how to put them together by common sense and looking at what fit in what hole and what cables they sent me.

841
00:55:30,781 --> 00:55:34,339
Speaker 1: And I successfully built a computer by looking at ads in a magazine.

842
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:39,499
Speaker 0: I feel like by that... Because I didn't build a computer until the year 2000, right before I went to RIT.

843
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:41,618
Speaker 0: I think I mostly used...

844
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:42,700
Speaker 1: This was in 1998 or 1999.

845
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:46,980
Speaker 0: I think by then I used, like, the old Tom's Hardware and egghead.com.

846
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used... This was 1999, yeah.

847
00:55:50,689 --> 00:55:53,540
Speaker 1: So I was a computer shopper, so that was a thing.

848
00:55:53,560 --> 00:56:01,219
Speaker 0: But the one that really got me was not Computer Shopper because it was... The 90s, like the late 90s, is when I really got deep into PCs.

849
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,100
Speaker 0: Before that, I was mostly interested in the software because I couldn't afford or build or mess with the hardware.

850
00:56:06,320 --> 00:56:08,060
Speaker 0: So I lived in the software world.

851
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:11,116
Speaker 0: But in the 90s, late 90s, I wanted to build computers.

852
00:56:11,136 --> 00:56:11,920
Speaker 0: I was getting into gaming.

853
00:56:12,100 --> 00:56:13,098
Speaker 0: Like, the hardware mattered more to me.

854
00:56:13,580 --> 00:56:23,100
Speaker 0: So Maximum PC was the one I read because it was the flashy magazine that had the articles talking about the fancy, newest nonsense that I definitely could not afford.

855
00:56:23,921 --> 00:56:30,180
Speaker 1: If Maximum PC still existed, they would be the ones with, like, the cases with the cooling systems and the lights and that kind of stuff.

856
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:30,751
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

857
00:56:30,772 --> 00:56:30,999
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

858
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:33,118
Speaker 1: That was the atmosphere of Maximum PC.

859
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:40,520
Speaker 0: But it had, like, this... Every issue had this overview of, like, what's the latest in the world of computing?

860
00:56:40,721 --> 00:56:44,100
Speaker 0: And that's how I stayed on top of things way more than the internet in that era.

861
00:56:45,762 --> 00:56:49,760
Speaker 0: And it also would have a lot of articles talking about how hardware worked, which Computer Shopper never had.

862
00:56:50,281 --> 00:56:54,995
Speaker 0: And that... Maximum PC... To be clear, I never subscribed to that magazine.

863
00:56:55,396 --> 00:56:56,820
Speaker 0: I would read it in the bookstore.

864
00:56:58,360 --> 00:56:59,799
Speaker 0: Most of these I read in bookstores.

865
00:57:00,560 --> 00:57:07,780
Speaker 0: The only one I got delivered and subscribed to was PC Gamer, which really we should talk about more on a Wednesday or a Tuesday episode.

866
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:10,791
Speaker 1: PC Gamer was mostly video game magazine.

867
00:57:11,112 --> 00:57:13,060
Speaker 1: It was the same as a GamePro or anything else.

868
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:18,040
Speaker 1: It just only talked about PC games and included a CD because it was talking about PC games.

869
00:57:18,141 --> 00:57:19,718
Speaker 0: PC Gamer came with a disc.

870
00:57:22,084 --> 00:57:23,218
Speaker 0: Eventually it came with a CD.

871
00:57:24,401 --> 00:57:29,780
Speaker 1: But it came with demos of games, sometimes full games, because you can do that when it's PC games.

872
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:33,180
Speaker 1: You couldn't really provide an NES cartridge with a Nintendo Power magazine.

873
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:34,639
Speaker 0: But I guess my point there is that...

874
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:36,772
Speaker 1: It also talked about hardware in there as well.

875
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:38,040
Speaker 1: So it was, like, a double deal.

876
00:57:38,761 --> 00:57:42,080
Speaker 1: They had game reviews and they had hardware stuff.

877
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:43,669
Speaker 0: Except I barely read PC Gamer.

878
00:57:43,730 --> 00:57:45,299
Speaker 0: I just wanted that disc.

879
00:57:46,143 --> 00:57:50,220
Speaker 1: I bought a few PC gamers off the shelf at the bookstore to get the disc.

880
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:53,177
Speaker 1: I never subscribed to it.

881
00:57:53,378 --> 00:57:53,580
Speaker 1: Anyway.

882
00:57:55,002 --> 00:57:59,860
Speaker 1: So you had your zines that were sort of... I guess the biggest zine was 2600.

883
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,640
Speaker 1: It was still somewhat alive.

884
00:58:01,740 --> 00:58:03,320
Speaker 0: It's actually the only one I read.

885
00:58:03,780 --> 00:58:10,160
Speaker 0: I would get the text of issues of 2600 from a local BBS that I would dial into.

886
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:16,000
Speaker 1: 2600 was big enough that actually they would have issues at the bookstore, on the shelf, with the other magazines.

887
00:58:16,162 --> 00:58:17,840
Speaker 1: Like at the Barnes and Noble or whatever.

888
00:58:18,404 --> 00:58:18,940
Speaker 1: Or the Borders.

889
00:58:19,862 --> 00:58:22,520
Speaker 1: I actually have a book that was published at some point.

890
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:24,750
Speaker 1: It's like best of 2600 collection.

891
00:58:24,770 --> 00:58:26,820
Speaker 1: Like this huge fat book that's on my shelf over there.

892
00:58:27,720 --> 00:58:32,319
Speaker 1: But 2600 started out as the phone freaking zine.

893
00:58:32,860 --> 00:58:34,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, which we were on the tail.

894
00:58:34,529 --> 00:58:36,500
Speaker 0: We were pretty young when that was dying out.

895
00:58:36,500 --> 00:58:37,578
Speaker 1: We were too young for that, yeah.

896
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:41,440
Speaker 1: So it was coming out of that scene.

897
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:47,020
Speaker 1: So it has an origin that was really sort of hardcore and ultra nerdy and whatnot.

898
00:58:47,781 --> 00:58:52,320
Speaker 1: But as time went on, the content didn't really get away from that.

899
00:58:52,540 --> 00:59:00,480
Speaker 1: The content was still articles about deep technical specific stuff in different areas.

900
00:59:02,043 --> 00:59:04,660
Speaker 1: But it was less underground.

901
00:59:04,981 --> 00:59:06,006
Speaker 1: People knew about it.

902
00:59:06,106 --> 00:59:08,436
Speaker 1: You could buy it literally at Borders books.

903
00:59:08,476 --> 00:59:09,360
Speaker 1: There it fucking is.

904
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:11,400
Speaker 1: It was being published properly.

905
00:59:11,780 --> 00:59:16,440
Speaker 0: It had much less of a counterculture street cred by that point.

906
00:59:17,241 --> 00:59:20,660
Speaker 1: Right, and it wasn't doing so much the illegal type contents.

907
00:59:21,361 --> 00:59:23,300
Speaker 1: Here's how to make free phone calls type stuff.

908
00:59:23,781 --> 00:59:29,140
Speaker 1: Even though it was still deep technical topics of various computing and phone nature.

909
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:35,620
Speaker 1: So 2600 really, I think, I'm not sure how or to what extent it still exists.

910
00:59:36,302 --> 00:59:40,040
Speaker 1: But it does have a historical importance to it.

911
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:45,980
Speaker 1: And is kind of representative, especially the earlier issues of what all those other zines were kind of like.

912
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:53,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's interesting because that was an era when I would read old 2600s but not more recent ones.

913
00:59:54,161 --> 01:00:01,439
Speaker 0: And I was mostly interested in the stories and the technology of freaking and all the old stuff that I mostly missed out on.

914
01:00:02,664 --> 01:00:04,240
Speaker 1: You didn't get to do it, but you learned about it.

915
01:00:04,260 --> 01:00:05,045
Speaker 0: I got to do it a little bit.

916
01:00:05,105 --> 01:00:07,680
Speaker 0: I did get a red box to work when I was in middle school.

917
01:00:09,163 --> 01:00:10,673
Speaker 0: But that's just the one that plays the tones.

918
01:00:10,713 --> 01:00:11,639
Speaker 0: that makes a payphone work.

919
01:00:12,061 --> 01:00:13,217
Speaker 0: That was a really easy thing to do.

920
01:00:15,401 --> 01:00:16,820
Speaker 1: It would work on an old payphone.

921
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:22,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, it totally worked on old payphones up until our early days in middle school in some parts of the US.

922
01:00:23,347 --> 01:00:24,720
Speaker 0: That definitely doesn't work anymore.

923
01:00:25,460 --> 01:00:29,640
Speaker 1: There was another set of magazines that I'd never bought or read at all, but I knew about them.

924
01:00:30,181 --> 01:00:32,120
Speaker 0: Like PC Magazine, all that stuff?

925
01:00:32,380 --> 01:00:33,464
Speaker 1: Right, PC Magazine.

926
01:00:33,504 --> 01:00:35,311
Speaker 1: I think the ZD had one.

927
01:00:36,254 --> 01:00:37,740
Speaker 1: CNET might have had one also.

928
01:00:38,440 --> 01:00:42,680
Speaker 1: And basically those magazines read the way those websites read.

929
01:00:43,340 --> 01:00:50,859
Speaker 1: These sort of popular articles about what's going on in the world of personal computing and stuff.

930
01:00:51,684 --> 01:00:55,401
Speaker 0: Oh, CNET shut down their magazine in 2019.

931
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,048
Speaker 1: Okay.

932
01:00:57,148 --> 01:01:00,020
Speaker 1: You go to CNET.com and look at the articles.

933
01:01:00,681 --> 01:01:04,880
Speaker 1: Or go to ZDNET, if that still exists, and read the articles or any of those places.

934
01:01:05,300 --> 01:01:09,340
Speaker 1: That's what those magazines were like, only full of ads, obviously, and on paper.

935
01:01:10,861 --> 01:01:13,840
Speaker 1: And so I'd only read them if I was in a dentist's office.

936
01:01:14,021 --> 01:01:20,120
Speaker 1: And they mostly appealed to these people who were not ultra nerdy, like you're going to program a computer.

937
01:01:20,562 --> 01:01:23,296
Speaker 1: But you're an uncle who's got money.

938
01:01:24,260 --> 01:01:25,679
Speaker 0: It was everyone's uncle who read these things.

939
01:01:26,280 --> 01:01:27,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're into computers.

940
01:01:27,611 --> 01:01:28,820
Speaker 1: You care about computers.

941
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:33,360
Speaker 1: You got your computer as a little hobby, but you're not programming.

942
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:38,780
Speaker 1: You're not going lower than simply going to CompUSA to have some fun.

943
01:01:39,422 --> 01:01:44,339
Speaker 0: I would say that those magazines, all the CNET adjacent magazines, there were so many of them.

944
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:48,060
Speaker 0: They were the things that might be in a dentist's office and you read out of boredom.

945
01:01:48,522 --> 01:01:51,859
Speaker 0: Or the people who liked them seemed to read them more for entertainment than knowledge.

946
01:01:52,902 --> 01:01:53,448
Speaker 0: Which is fair.

947
01:01:53,528 --> 01:01:54,719
Speaker 0: I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.

948
01:01:55,542 --> 01:02:04,020
Speaker 0: I read Popular Science for entertainment, not to learn anything in particular, because it didn't teach much past a certain point in its history.

949
01:02:04,100 --> 01:02:06,860
Speaker 1: I always remembered at the barber shop there was always a golf magazine.

950
01:02:07,100 --> 01:02:11,320
Speaker 1: And I didn't golf, but I would read the golf magazine there and it'd be fun.

951
01:02:11,540 --> 01:02:14,360
Speaker 1: But it's like professional golfers were not reading the golf magazine.

952
01:02:17,101 --> 01:02:21,759
Speaker 0: It's the same way at the dentist I would read Reader's Digest because that's what was there.

953
01:02:22,801 --> 01:02:23,157
Speaker 1: Exactly.

954
01:02:23,580 --> 01:02:24,619
Speaker 0: I didn't have a Game Boy yet.

955
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,070
Speaker 1: So there was a whole bunch of those.

956
01:02:26,211 --> 01:02:27,139
Speaker 1: I think they're all dead now.

957
01:02:27,700 --> 01:02:29,568
Speaker 1: There was one called Dr.

958
01:02:29,608 --> 01:02:30,331
Speaker 1: Dobbs Journal.

959
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:32,259
Speaker 1: I don't know if this still exists or not.

960
01:02:32,841 --> 01:02:37,320
Speaker 1: But it was sort of borderline scientific journal magazine.

961
01:02:39,341 --> 01:02:48,720
Speaker 1: And the only time I read it is because it would be lying around just for free when I was in college in the computer science area.

962
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,700
Speaker 1: They would just have these lying around on tables and I would read it occasionally.

963
01:02:52,341 --> 01:02:56,920
Speaker 1: And it had journal article type stuff in it among ads and other things.

964
01:02:57,381 --> 01:03:00,300
Speaker 1: Mostly to do with actual programming and computer science.

965
01:03:00,641 --> 01:03:08,540
Speaker 1: Oh, here's a cryptography journal article formatted in late LaTeX and everything.

966
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:16,159
Speaker 1: I'm not sure if it actually was a real journal where you tried to get your research published or not.

967
01:03:16,963 --> 01:03:19,059
Speaker 1: But it sure read like one only with ads in it.

968
01:03:19,561 --> 01:03:21,169
Speaker 1: So that was a thing.

969
01:03:21,189 --> 01:03:23,098
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's still around now.

970
01:03:24,722 --> 01:03:28,240
Speaker 0: It's interesting because I see like that whole class of content itself.

971
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:40,200
Speaker 0: Like, I don't know, there's a lot of websites like Gizmodo and Engadget and things that basically their articles are the same kind of content that would be in a lot of the PC magazine articles back in the day just on a website.

972
01:03:40,941 --> 01:03:53,480
Speaker 0: But at the same time, the world is so different now that the format of read a magazine that is a curated selection of those articles every month doesn't really fit anymore.

973
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:01,060
Speaker 0: Like I read the individual articles and individual sites based on specific interests, which is just a radically different paradigm from the pre-internet world.

974
01:04:03,422 --> 01:04:07,580
Speaker 1: So last magazine category I can think of is this one that I got for free.

975
01:04:07,741 --> 01:04:09,640
Speaker 1: I don't remember how the fuck I got it for free.

976
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:12,897
Speaker 1: I had like a one or two year subscription for zero dollars somehow in the late 90s.

977
01:04:14,062 --> 01:04:16,820
Speaker 1: And it was called Silicon Alley Reporter.

978
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,199
Speaker 1: It doesn't exist now for sure.

979
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,099
Speaker 0: I never encountered that one, I don't think.

980
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:21,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

981
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:27,660
Speaker 1: So it was basically this came out of the 90s, like investment boom kind of deal.

982
01:04:27,881 --> 01:04:28,202
Speaker 1: Right.

983
01:04:28,242 --> 01:04:31,960
Speaker 1: You know, with tech stocks booming up and startups and all that biz.

984
01:04:33,641 --> 01:04:45,400
Speaker 1: And all the articles in it were a lot like the articles you'd read today on like, you know, a hacker news or a tech dirt kind of place, which is talking about startups and business more than it's talking about technology.

985
01:04:46,381 --> 01:04:55,820
Speaker 1: And it had a mix of that sort of like, you know, Silicon Valley disgusting culture, but it was the Silicon Alley reporter.

986
01:04:56,301 --> 01:05:02,860
Speaker 1: And it was basically trying to sort of promote New York as like, hey, in New York, we have a Silicon Alley.

987
01:05:03,041 --> 01:05:05,679
Speaker 1: It's the same kind of thing as Silicon Valley, only in New York.

988
01:05:06,622 --> 01:05:06,843
Speaker 1: Right.

989
01:05:06,863 --> 01:05:10,019
Speaker 1: Kind of trying to drum up that same disgusting culture here.

990
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:16,100
Speaker 0: You know, I usually say the other thing, Silicon Valley pays people in dreams and in New York, they got to pay you cash.

991
01:05:16,382 --> 01:05:18,700
Speaker 0: That's why nobody likes to talk about Silicon Alley.

992
01:05:19,581 --> 01:05:27,880
Speaker 1: But the Silicon Alley reporter also, right, mixed in sort of like, you know, a lot of like futurist type thinking articles.

993
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,440
Speaker 1: There would always be like one or two in there along with all the other stuff.

994
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:33,872
Speaker 1: So it's like I was getting it for free.

995
01:05:33,892 --> 01:05:34,559
Speaker 1: I don't know how.

996
01:05:38,084 --> 01:05:40,900
Speaker 1: And you obviously didn't see it at RIT because it had stopped showing up.

997
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:53,120
Speaker 0: I guess what I miss from this entire space, because we've gone on for well over an hour already, but I miss the computer magazines that would have an interesting project or how to every month.

998
01:05:53,481 --> 01:05:55,879
Speaker 1: Like those make magazine went under.

999
01:05:56,320 --> 01:05:58,718
Speaker 1: Make magazine was a thing you could make.

1000
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:01,160
Speaker 1: I never got make magazine because it was expensive.

1001
01:06:01,943 --> 01:06:04,020
Speaker 1: If it was cheaper, I would have gotten it.

1002
01:06:04,080 --> 01:06:09,220
Speaker 1: But I really liked all the things that like that make organization was doing, especially the Maker Faire.

1003
01:06:09,784 --> 01:06:11,920
Speaker 1: They just went under even pre-pandemic.

1004
01:06:12,420 --> 01:06:18,020
Speaker 0: I guess what I miss, and I don't think this is just me like having nostalgia and remembering incorrectly.

1005
01:06:18,901 --> 01:06:25,920
Speaker 0: But in those old the PC magazines that had how tos and projects and like guides like, hey, here's how to build a thing or do a cool thing.

1006
01:06:26,963 --> 01:06:29,320
Speaker 0: They did a lot more explanation of the how and why.

1007
01:06:29,842 --> 01:06:34,160
Speaker 0: And the instructions were usually airtight and really well put together with context.

1008
01:06:35,501 --> 01:06:39,800
Speaker 0: Online today, that type of content seems to have split into two directions.

1009
01:06:40,301 --> 01:06:44,520
Speaker 0: It's either here's a bunch of stuff to copy paste into config files with no explanation.

1010
01:06:44,641 --> 01:06:47,159
Speaker 0: That won't work even two months after it comes out.

1011
01:06:47,944 --> 01:06:49,279
Speaker 0: Or it's a video.

1012
01:06:50,601 --> 01:06:53,620
Speaker 0: The least information dense way to present that information.

1013
01:06:54,680 --> 01:07:00,620
Speaker 1: Well, it's also a consequence of just if you have some old computer and you need the computers to help you do something.

1014
01:07:01,383 --> 01:07:05,740
Speaker 1: It's like that computer you're working so much closer to the metal.

1015
01:07:06,381 --> 01:07:07,900
Speaker 0: You really needed that foundation.

1016
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,500
Speaker 1: At least in terms of abstraction layers.

1017
01:07:11,781 --> 01:07:16,259
Speaker 1: It's like you really need someone to tell you like, type this, now type this, now press this key.

1018
01:07:17,281 --> 01:07:22,420
Speaker 1: You don't need that on a current computer because you can describe something to something at the higher abstraction layer.

1019
01:07:22,540 --> 01:07:25,140
Speaker 1: You can be like install that and then do that.

1020
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,460
Speaker 1: It's like you don't have to be like, OK, put the disk in the computer.

1021
01:07:28,561 --> 01:07:30,280
Speaker 1: Now type install, now press enter.

1022
01:07:30,461 --> 01:07:31,076
Speaker 1: You don't have to do that.

1023
01:07:33,082 --> 01:07:39,317
Speaker 1: I do highly recommend going in archive.org and if not the computist, just look for any old computer magazines, 80s, 90s.

1024
01:07:40,660 --> 01:07:44,260
Speaker 1: And it's like that content of that type just doesn't exist anymore.

1025
01:07:45,001 --> 01:07:54,480
Speaker 1: And if you really want to have a lot of fun, get some magazines that go with a particular old computer like an Apple II or like an Amiga.

1026
01:07:54,621 --> 01:07:57,795
Speaker 0: Like Amiga magazines had their Amiga specific nonsense.

1027
01:07:57,835 --> 01:07:58,880
Speaker 0: that was always real fun.

1028
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:05,480
Speaker 1: And then get yourself an emulator for that old computer and do the stuff in the magazines.

1029
01:08:05,763 --> 01:08:07,599
Speaker 1: You can actually have a really fun time that way.

1030
01:08:08,882 --> 01:08:09,778
Speaker 1: I might in fact do that.

1031
01:08:11,664 --> 01:08:12,528
Speaker 0: I could finally play.

1032
01:08:12,568 --> 01:08:14,739
Speaker 0: I've never messed with an Amiga in my life actually.

1033
01:08:15,540 --> 01:08:15,863
Speaker 1: Me either.

1034
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:17,314
Speaker 1: I've seen one.

1035
01:08:17,515 --> 01:08:17,796
Speaker 1: That's it.

1036
01:08:24,060 --> 01:08:26,200
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1037
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:31,420
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1038
01:08:31,700 --> 01:08:36,720

1039
01:08:37,000 --> 01:08:39,660
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1040
01:08:39,880 --> 01:08:44,420
Speaker 0: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1042
01:08:49,240 --> 01:08:52,180
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1043
01:08:52,460 --> 01:08:55,359
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1044
01:08:56,104 --> 01:09:26,899
Speaker 0: And the Patreon Patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are Heidi McNicholallen, Joyce Link, Eiji Dread, Lily Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Clinton Walton, Dex Finn, JustLikeADudeGuy, Kshaya Yaw, 85, Rebecca Dunn, ReviewMadBull34, Cowards, Ryan Parent, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Horrell, Taylor Braun, UndergramProLaw, Ed O'Peirce, RightSeed, AbThreat, Open, YouHoldTheKeyToMyHeart, and a bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1045
01:09:27,479 --> 01:09:32,300
Speaker 0: As you've noticed, we are continuing our regularly scheduled cadence of episodes.

1046
01:09:33,241 --> 01:09:41,220
Speaker 0: And you're going to see our content start to increase again as we slowly emerge from the quarantine, start to get outside, start to do things in our lives.

1047
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:42,917
Speaker 0: We've got a few projects in the hopper.

1048
01:09:43,962 --> 01:09:46,859
Speaker 0: So we'll see what comes of that potential occasional Geek Nights Friday.

1049
01:09:46,981 --> 01:09:48,960
Speaker 0: We'll see what comes of some other things.

1050
01:09:49,322 --> 01:09:56,700
Speaker 0: We're not restarting the Utena show, because as I've said a couple times, we keep getting legal trouble too often for those videos.

1051
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:59,480
Speaker 0: It's just not worth it to make anime content on YouTube.

1052
01:09:59,780 --> 01:10:03,539
Speaker 0: Like, I'm sorry, that sucks, but it's just not worth the risk to us.

1053
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:08,480
Speaker 0: And if you have a problem with that, you can write to your senator and try to get the DMC overturned.

1054
01:10:09,140 --> 01:10:11,851
Speaker 0: But for now, I leave you with...

1055
01:10:14,943 --> 01:10:16,212
Speaker 2: I don't want to be an emperor.

1056
01:10:16,635 --> 01:10:17,300
Speaker 2: That's not my business.

1057
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:20,506
Speaker 2: ...or conquer anyone.

1058
01:10:20,526 --> 01:10:22,700
Speaker 2: I should like to help everyone if possible.

1059
01:10:23,281 --> 01:10:25,460
Speaker 2: Jew, Gentile, black man, white.

1060
01:10:26,440 --> 01:10:27,689
Speaker 2: We all want to help one another.

1061
01:10:27,971 --> 01:10:29,099
Speaker 2: Human beings are like that.

1062
01:10:29,880 --> 01:10:32,080
Speaker 2: We want to live by each other's happiness, not by each other's misery.

1063
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:34,680
Speaker 2: We don't want to hate and despise one another.

1064
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:39,840
Speaker 2: In this world, there's room for everyone, and the good earth is rich and can provide for everyone.

1065
01:10:40,460 --> 01:10:44,400
Speaker 2: The way of life can be free and beautiful, but we have lost the way.

1066
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:52,280
Speaker 2: Greed has poisoned men's souls, has barricaded the world with hate, has goose-stepped us into misery and bloodshed.

1067
01:10:53,181 --> 01:10:55,799
Speaker 2: We have developed speed, but we have shut ourselves in.

1068
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,679
Speaker 2: Machinery that gives abundance has left us in want.

1069
01:10:59,420 --> 01:11:02,640
Speaker 2: Our knowledge has made us cynical, our cleverness hard and unkind.

1070
01:11:03,321 --> 01:11:05,399
Speaker 2: We think too much and feel too little.

1071
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,240
Speaker 2: More than machinery, we need humanity.

1072
01:11:08,761 --> 01:11:11,540
Speaker 2: More than cleverness, we need kindness and gentleness.

1073
01:11:12,263 --> 01:11:15,520
Speaker 2: Without these qualities, life will be violent and all will be lost.

1074
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,680
Speaker 2: The aeroplane and the radio have brought us closer together.

1075
01:11:19,060 --> 01:11:24,859
Speaker 2: The very nature of these inventions cries out for the goodness in men, cries out for universal brotherhood, for the unity of us all.

1076
01:11:25,560 --> 01:11:35,720
Speaker 2: Even now, my voice is reaching millions throughout the world, millions of despairing men, women and little children, victims of a system that makes men torture and imprison innocent people.

1077
01:11:36,641 --> 01:11:39,340
Speaker 2: To those who can hear me, I say, do not despair.

1078
01:11:39,964 --> 01:11:46,100
Speaker 2: The misery that is now upon us is but the passing of greed, the bitterness of men who fear the way of human progress.

1079
01:11:46,781 --> 01:11:53,120
Speaker 2: The hate of men will pass and dictators die, and the power they took from the people will return to the people.

1080
01:11:53,521 --> 01:11:56,439
Speaker 2: And so long as men die, liberty will never perish.

1081
01:11:58,541 --> 01:12:00,539
Speaker 0: Soldiers, don't give yourselves to brutes.

1082
01:12:01,200 --> 01:12:10,600
Speaker 0: Men who despise you, enslave you, who regiment your lives, tell you what to do, what to think and what to feel, who drill you, diet you, treat you like cattle, use you as cannon fodder.

1083
01:12:11,161 --> 01:12:16,659
Speaker 2: Don't give yourselves to these unnatural men, machine men, with machine minds and machine hearts.

1084
01:12:17,261 --> 01:12:20,339
Speaker 2: You are not machines, you are not cattle, you are men.

1085
01:12:21,021 --> 01:12:22,759
Speaker 2: You have the love of humanity in your hearts.

1086
01:12:23,180 --> 01:12:26,960
Speaker 2: You don't hate, only the unloved hate, the unloved and the unnatural.

1087
01:12:27,500 --> 01:12:30,420
Speaker 0: Soldiers, don't fight for slavery, fight for liberty.

1088
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,073
Speaker 2: In the 17th chapter of St.

1089
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:42,780
Speaker 2: Luke it is written, the kingdom of God is within man, not one man nor a group of men, but in all men, in you, you the people have the power, the power to create machines, the power to create happiness.

1090
01:12:43,160 --> 01:12:48,460
Speaker 2: You the people have the power to make this life free and beautiful, to make this life a wonderful adventure.

1091
01:12:48,921 --> 01:13:01,140
Speaker 1: Then in the name of democracy, let us use that power, let us all unite, let us fight for a new world, a decent world that will give men a chance to work, that will give youth a future and old age a security.

1092
01:13:01,600 --> 01:13:07,799
Speaker 2: By the promise of these things, brutes have risen to power, but they lie, they do not fulfill that promise, they never will.

1093
01:13:08,380 --> 01:13:11,460
Speaker 2: Dictators free themselves, but they enslave the people.

1094
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:22,100
Speaker 2: Now let us fight to fulfill that promise, let us fight to free the world, to do away with national barriers, to do away with greed, with hate and intolerance.

1095
01:13:22,881 --> 01:13:28,820
Speaker 0: Let us fight for a world of reason, a world where science and progress will lead to all men's happiness.

1096
01:13:29,780 --> 01:13:33,159
Speaker 1: Soldiers, in the name of democracy, let us all unite!
