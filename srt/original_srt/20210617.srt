1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:09,648
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, June 17th, 2021.

2
00:00:09,648 --> 00:00:10,010
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,127 --> 00:00:13,620
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:15,205
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,245 --> 00:00:19,620
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about hotels and motels.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:21,556
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:34,200
Speaker 0: So PAX Online is coming up in July, but it didn't actually give us that much time to record and upload a panel for that.

8
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:41,560
Speaker 1: The panel acceptance and the due date to submit the panel were very close to each other.

9
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:45,816
Speaker 1: I think it's like, did you expect us to have this panel prepared before you accepted it?

10
00:00:45,876 --> 00:00:46,700
Speaker 1: or like, well, I don't know.

11
00:00:47,501 --> 00:00:56,300
Speaker 0: Well, I've realized that most people who do panels for online anythings just get a bunch of people in a zoom, start recording, go for an hour, stop recording.

12
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:57,195
Speaker 0: And that's what they upload.

13
00:00:58,946 --> 00:00:59,860
Speaker 1: Well, that's not what we're going to do.

14
00:01:01,101 --> 00:01:06,340
Speaker 1: Not only is that not what we do, but they specifically asked for people to not do that and to do more.

15
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:06,821
Speaker 1: Yep.

16
00:01:07,184 --> 00:01:08,819
Speaker 0: So we actually had to do a lot more.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:16,660
Speaker 0: And since we still couldn't get together in person yet to get that going, we had to come up with a moderately complex pipeline for me to play Atari games.

18
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,806
Speaker 0: But it seems like it worked.

19
00:01:17,846 --> 00:01:20,080
Speaker 0: But that's why we skipped the show on Tuesday.

20
00:01:20,921 --> 00:01:22,327
Speaker 1: We might be able to get together soon.

21
00:01:22,367 --> 00:01:25,840
Speaker 1: The numbers, at least in New York, are actually down now for real.

22
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,260
Speaker 1: Not like before where it looked like they were down, but now they're really down.

23
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:34,320
Speaker 0: I am confident the next video the two of us make that is not just this live stream will record it in person.

24
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:35,419
Speaker 0: So stay tuned on that.

25
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:41,960
Speaker 0: But yeah, so we skipped Tuesday, the Tuesday Geek Nights to record the panel.

26
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:45,120
Speaker 0: So I'd have time to edit it because I got to upload that thing like this weekend.

27
00:01:46,023 --> 00:01:47,059
Speaker 0: And that's a shame.

28
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:58,340
Speaker 0: The one time we skip a Tuesday episode as opposed to the other episodes of Geek Nights happens to be when not only does Nintendo do their direct, but they announced like fucking everything.

29
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:00,003
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

30
00:02:00,265 --> 00:02:01,720
Speaker 1: It was a big time Nintendo Direct.

31
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:04,699
Speaker 1: Well, it was E3, I guess, but who cares about that?

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:20,740
Speaker 1: But yeah, regardless, the Nintendo Direct had all kinds of big time announcements, only one of which was one that was anticipated, which is some more information about Breath of the Wild 2, or at least the sequel to Breath of the Wild.

33
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:26,520
Speaker 0: There's definitely a midnight Twilight Princess connection with that music and that color.

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:26,925
Speaker 1: Maybe.

35
00:02:27,272 --> 00:02:27,659
Speaker 1: Who knows?

36
00:02:29,321 --> 00:02:39,800
Speaker 1: But also the news that everyone thought was going to be right, that all the game journalist places were like, oh, they're going to announce a new updated switch, like a switch plus or a 4K switch or something like that.

37
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:43,059
Speaker 0: I know that I was not predicting that because I did not think that's what they were going to do.

38
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,839
Speaker 1: Well, and then they did not do that.

39
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:51,759
Speaker 1: And then every single I saw two at least two articles that were like, of course, Nintendo wasn't going to say that at E3.

40
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,685
Speaker 1: Here's why.

41
00:02:52,766 --> 00:02:54,200
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, yeah, sure.

42
00:02:54,501 --> 00:02:58,654
Speaker 1: You can publish the same journalistic outfit that said they were going to.

43
00:02:58,694 --> 00:03:00,580
Speaker 1: I did not going to bother to go dig up and see.

44
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,420
Speaker 1: But maybe there's a good chance you were.

45
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:07,500
Speaker 0: I mean, it's much like whenever we can't come up with the show topic, I go delete a show we already did.

46
00:03:07,782 --> 00:03:10,559
Speaker 0: And then magically, oh, hey, it turns out we never talked about hotels.

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,542
Speaker 0: There's an episode.

48
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:17,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, they could have just done the put up something that was like we were wrong.

49
00:03:19,463 --> 00:03:25,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, we do a whole show years ago that was like things we were wrong about, like predictions we made that were just fucking wrong.

50
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:26,285
Speaker 1: We could do that.

51
00:03:26,305 --> 00:03:27,196
Speaker 1: We could do that show every day.

52
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:28,166
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're.

53
00:03:28,348 --> 00:03:29,680
Speaker 0: we're wrong moderately often.

54
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:33,979
Speaker 0: You know, we're not wrong about often is judging anime by its cover, which we haven't done in a while.

55
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:36,580
Speaker 1: We're wrong about it more than zero times.

56
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were definitely wrong about that arm whatever show X arm.

57
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,260
Speaker 0: That show was not what I thought it was going to be anyway.

58
00:03:44,542 --> 00:03:45,260
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

59
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:46,062
Speaker 0: Yeah.

60
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:53,200
Speaker 0: Anyway, there is there is one bit of news that we think is worth talking about today from that Nintendo announcement.

61
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:53,764
Speaker 0: Because it was not.

62
00:03:53,784 --> 00:03:55,440
Speaker 1: well, it's not from that Nintendo announcement.

63
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:56,021
Speaker 1: It was from.

64
00:03:56,542 --> 00:04:03,620
Speaker 1: it was from today, the day after the Nintendo announcement, they announced is going to be a Pokemon MOBA called Pokemon Unite.

65
00:04:05,341 --> 00:04:09,680
Speaker 1: And basically the way it's going to work, at least, you know, on paper, it seems interesting.

66
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,087
Speaker 1: But then again, there was like there were.

67
00:04:11,127 --> 00:04:13,940
Speaker 1: there have been games in the past, like what was a Pokemon Conquest, right?

68
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:21,920
Speaker 0: Pokemon Conquest cross Nobunaga's Ambition, Final Fantasy, was called Pokemon Conquest, I forget because it was terrible.

69
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,860
Speaker 1: Regardless, it was a game that on paper seemed great, but in reality was not.

70
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,600
Speaker 1: So this game seems similar to me.

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,578
Speaker 1: It's give me the same vibes.

72
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,442
Speaker 1: Pokemon Unite.

73
00:04:30,024 --> 00:04:34,200
Speaker 1: It's a MOBA where you have you control a Pokemon, which makes perfect sense for a MOBA, right?

74
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,659
Speaker 1: You start the match at level one.

75
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:39,191
Speaker 0: You evolve as the match goes on, making a level shit up during.

76
00:04:39,251 --> 00:04:41,840
Speaker 1: Pokemon have four special abilities already.

77
00:04:41,942 --> 00:04:43,140
Speaker 1: So do MOBA characters.

78
00:04:43,321 --> 00:04:45,940
Speaker 1: It's like you can't find a better perfect match than that.

79
00:04:46,961 --> 00:04:47,142
Speaker 1: Right.

80
00:04:48,184 --> 00:04:56,740
Speaker 1: And the on paper, the way the game is going to work is that you go around killing environment, you know, stuff and jungling, as the MOBA people call it, right?

81
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:01,420
Speaker 1: Fighting AI controlled enemies and also fighting the opponent Pokemon.

82
00:05:01,621 --> 00:05:04,200
Speaker 1: And every time you get a kill, you get some points.

83
00:05:04,761 --> 00:05:23,760
Speaker 1: And then the interesting part that I really like on paper, again, I had to emphasize that so much, is that in order to actually, you know, cash the points in to make them count, you have to go deep into enemy territory, survive, and I guess touch the equivalent of like a basketball hoop to dunk them in.

84
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,161
Speaker 1: Right.

85
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:25,780
Speaker 1: It's like, and then they count.

86
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:34,280
Speaker 1: And I like, I really like that aspect of go deep into enemy territory because I always felt like when playing, I guess Dota is the one I played more.

87
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,420
Speaker 1: I didn't really play League of Legends.

88
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:38,160
Speaker 1: Maybe I did half a tutorial or something.

89
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did play here for like four hours total.

90
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:46,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played Dota 2, I guess the most, which is a handful of times.

91
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:48,700
Speaker 0: I think I played more auto chess than I played any MOBA.

92
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:50,759
Speaker 1: I definitely played more auto chess than any MOBA.

93
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,999
Speaker 0: Well, talk about a flash in the pan there.

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:04,920
Speaker 1: If you go, I would, I was always disappointed in that I would play Dota 2 and often I would be able to get all the way through to the enemy territory, like right up next to what's called the ancient, right?

95
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,319
Speaker 1: The thing you're trying to destroy, the main goal of the game, right?

96
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,358
Speaker 1: Destroy the thing.

97
00:06:10,043 --> 00:06:11,399
Speaker 1: And I'll be right up next to it.

98
00:06:11,762 --> 00:06:15,080
Speaker 1: And there would be no enemies there except for the little weak AI ones.

99
00:06:15,802 --> 00:06:18,920
Speaker 1: And there was basically no reward for doing that.

100
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:33,680
Speaker 0: Like I'm damn early in the game and I'm already damaging football and I were on offense and you've got the ball and I'm not eligible receiver and I just run all the way to the enemy end zone and hang out there.

101
00:06:34,162 --> 00:06:38,480
Speaker 1: I am not rewarded for that, but there is no ball in like I'm damaging it.

102
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:43,300
Speaker 0: Like I, you know, I felt I always start kicking the goalposts or attack the ref.

103
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,057
Speaker 0: I don't know.

104
00:06:44,481 --> 00:06:47,180
Speaker 1: No, but it's like there is no having the ball in a MOBA.

105
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,220
Speaker 1: It's like the goal is to just get yourself to destroy the right.

106
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,859
Speaker 1: You are, everyone's a ball basically.

107
00:06:53,168 --> 00:06:53,337
Speaker 1: Right.

108
00:06:53,964 --> 00:06:54,739
Speaker 1: Or a partial one.

109
00:06:55,181 --> 00:07:02,000
Speaker 1: And I felt like it was like, if you go over there and just start attacking it, it's like you pretty much just die and are ineffectual and it even heals and stuff.

110
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,160
Speaker 1: It's like, or, you know, you, you do so little damage to it.

111
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:05,780
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

112
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:07,040
Speaker 1: I felt like that wasn't cool.

113
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:13,760
Speaker 1: So this actually, I like it, at least on paper that you can go deep in enemy territory is rewarding.

114
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,480
Speaker 0: There's a lot of ways a game like this could go wrong.

115
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,980
Speaker 0: Oh, so many ways until we know the details.

116
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:26,528
Speaker 0: The idea of the idea of Pokemon MMO is a very good idea, but execution is literally all that matters.

117
00:07:26,588 --> 00:07:35,000
Speaker 0: because for example, Pokemon go was good at a lot of things, but in terms of a game that had mechanics, not much going on.

118
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:36,020
Speaker 1: It was not.

119
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:36,296
Speaker 1: Yeah.

120
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:44,680
Speaker 1: So this is going to be free, at least for some amount of play, which is good because we can all try it.

121
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:55,440
Speaker 0: But it's a red flag in some ways because games that start free often either have microtransactions or are like bottom tier shovelware and they're free.

122
00:07:56,121 --> 00:07:57,260
Speaker 1: So that is all that is true.

123
00:07:57,441 --> 00:08:03,120
Speaker 1: If you consider all video games and Nintendo's history of free games, doesn't follow that path.

124
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:13,380
Speaker 1: Nintendo's history of free to play games is ones like the Mario Kart or the Mario World, you know, where it's like, okay, it's free to play, but then you're not really playing the full game.

125
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,540
Speaker 1: But then you pay 10 bucks.

126
00:08:14,682 --> 00:08:15,800
Speaker 1: It's like, all right, now you have everything.

127
00:08:16,861 --> 00:08:22,700
Speaker 1: The only exception to that might be that Animal Crossing mobile game, which was microtransaction-y collecty bits.

128
00:08:24,882 --> 00:08:28,860
Speaker 1: But yeah, the game's going to be free on Switch and then mobile, right?

129
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,320
Speaker 0: So it's mobile is intriguing.

130
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:45,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know that there has been a game that's on Switch and mobile yet, and I assume you'll be able to play against each other, but also suggest that the controls of the game will be very simplified if you're not playing with mouse and keyboard on a PC or whatever.

131
00:08:46,182 --> 00:08:47,839
Speaker 0: So, yeah, we'll see how that goes then.

132
00:08:48,021 --> 00:08:48,920
Speaker 0: That's why I'm hesitant.

133
00:08:49,768 --> 00:08:50,780
Speaker 1: It's still very interesting.

134
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,800
Speaker 0: You know, there's a lot going on here.

135
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:56,220
Speaker 0: And probably by the next time we do a Tuesday show, there'll be a lot more information.

136
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,399
Speaker 0: We can talk about this in more depth.

137
00:08:57,883 --> 00:08:59,599
Speaker 1: I don't think we'll have more information till it comes out.

138
00:08:59,965 --> 00:09:00,294
Speaker 0: I don't know.

139
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:04,168
Speaker 0: I see there's already a little more people have talked about.

140
00:09:04,408 --> 00:09:08,460
Speaker 0: the Pokémon will be grouped into four classes, like Attacker, Speedster, Support all around there.

141
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was in the main announcement.

142
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:09,948
Speaker 1: Yep.

143
00:09:10,481 --> 00:09:11,840
Speaker 0: So there's a decent amount of info already.

144
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,259
Speaker 1: That's not more.

145
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:14,240
Speaker 0: That wasn't it.

146
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,119
Speaker 0: That was added to the article I was looking at.

147
00:09:17,382 --> 00:09:20,580
Speaker 0: I guess this article is probably being written while this was happening.

148
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:27,319
Speaker 0: Anyway, in some other news, there were a bunch of big Supreme Court decisions in the U.S.

149
00:09:27,339 --> 00:09:27,580
Speaker 0: today.

150
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,940
Speaker 1: Because like this court session, I just want to make a small comment here because it's Thursday.

151
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,679
Speaker 0: Oh, you got some thoughts about the Supreme Court?

152
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,340
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, no.

153
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,380
Speaker 1: I got some thoughts about government in general.

154
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:39,160
Speaker 1: All right, all right.

155
00:09:39,842 --> 00:09:44,880
Speaker 1: So even government representatives, right, good or bad, are still laborers, right?

156
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:51,740
Speaker 1: They got to have some time off, you know, in vacation days, PTO, paternal, you know, maternal leaves, all those things.

157
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,140
Speaker 1: Obviously, they deserve just like any other laborer, right?

158
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,659
Speaker 1: You know, making legislating his work, you know, executiving his work.

159
00:09:57,969 --> 00:09:58,077
Speaker 0: Yep.

160
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:03,520
Speaker 0: Especially when you get out of national politics, like a state senator does not get paid much.

161
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,020
Speaker 1: Right, exactly.

162
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:07,500
Speaker 1: So, yeah, they should have some time off.

163
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:13,160
Speaker 1: But for example, right in New York, the legislative session just ended.

164
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:16,900
Speaker 1: They had like up until there's like a clock ticking.

165
00:10:17,021 --> 00:10:19,219
Speaker 1: And once the time runs out, it's like, that's it.

166
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,077
Speaker 1: No more laws.

167
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,359
Speaker 1: Try again next time.

168
00:10:21,487 --> 00:10:21,660
Speaker 1: Right.

169
00:10:21,781 --> 00:10:22,162
Speaker 1: It's like.

170
00:10:23,609 --> 00:10:25,940
Speaker 1: and here we have the Supreme Court of the United States.

171
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:26,376
Speaker 1: Same thing.

172
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,219
Speaker 1: They had a session.

173
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:34,180
Speaker 1: It's coming to an end, which is why we're getting all these, you know, they're getting all their work out and then they're going to be done until next time.

174
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:38,620
Speaker 1: And it's like, fucking excuse me, like any of these cases.

175
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:46,980
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, your individual people don't have to work 24/7, 365, even if your job is super important, like Supreme Court justice.

176
00:10:47,522 --> 00:10:52,500
Speaker 1: But those government institutions need to be open all the fucking time.

177
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,980
Speaker 1: If something happens, the court's got to be ready to make a ruling.

178
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,020
Speaker 1: If something happens in the middle of the summer, we might need fucking laws.

179
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,058
Speaker 0: There was also something.

180
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,700
Speaker 1: We shouldn't have any session nonsense.

181
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,519
Speaker 1: What year is it?

182
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:11,820
Speaker 1: 18 something where you have to travel all the way from one state to Congress to to be in session and then go back to your own state in a horse and carriage.

183
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:14,180
Speaker 1: It's like always in session.

184
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,140
Speaker 1: None of these first Congress, second Congress, third Congress.

185
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:18,579
Speaker 1: It's time to end that shit.

186
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:19,345
Speaker 1: There's always.

187
00:11:19,426 --> 00:11:20,719
Speaker 1: Congress is always on.

188
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:23,695
Speaker 1: So if you're not there, call in your vote, whatever.

189
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:31,160
Speaker 0: Most of our members of Congress are have spent more time in horse and buggies than they have in cars.

190
00:11:32,126 --> 00:11:32,619
Speaker 1: That's true.

191
00:11:33,182 --> 00:11:37,000
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying in general, all of these very important government institutions.

192
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:37,780
Speaker 1: Right.

193
00:11:38,143 --> 00:11:38,878
Speaker 1: No more closing.

194
00:11:39,144 --> 00:11:40,560
Speaker 1: It's 2021.

195
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,580
Speaker 0: So I want to preface this by saying that the Roman Empire may perhaps have been far from an ideal form of government.

196
00:11:48,461 --> 00:11:50,360
Speaker 0: There may have been problems with Rome.

197
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,460
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the specific subject of having sessions.

198
00:11:55,160 --> 00:12:10,380
Speaker 0: But at different at some at several points in Roman history, there was this concept that the more powerful a political role was, the more restrictions there were on that person's ability to live their life and do whatever they want.

199
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,160
Speaker 0: Why good.

200
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:26,140
Speaker 0: The idea being, on one hand, if you seek power, it should arguably be made more and more uncomfortable the more power you have so that no one would want that power for necessarily the wrong reasons.

201
00:12:26,642 --> 00:12:30,480
Speaker 0: Now, someone might be willing to endure discomfort to have great power anyway.

202
00:12:31,044 --> 00:12:32,480
Speaker 0: But there is this concept.

203
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:37,276
Speaker 0: Imagine if Congress and the presidency were set up such like the president's.

204
00:12:37,296 --> 00:12:38,140
Speaker 0: he kind of is this way.

205
00:12:38,581 --> 00:12:43,980
Speaker 0: But imagine if Congress, the National Congress, if you're in it, you have to go live in a dorm like your whole family.

206
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:48,220
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, we've talked about that before, but like that's even beyond what I'm saying.

207
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:48,542
Speaker 1: Right.

208
00:12:48,702 --> 00:12:52,280
Speaker 1: All I'm saying here is we don't need to have sessions.

209
00:12:52,642 --> 00:12:52,864
Speaker 1: Right.

210
00:12:52,944 --> 00:12:55,080
Speaker 1: It's just Congress is open every day.

211
00:12:55,180 --> 00:13:01,100
Speaker 1: If you if there's a new law to be proposed today, today, systemic and structural problem here.

212
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,860
Speaker 0: The problem is members of the House get reelected every two years.

213
00:13:05,163 --> 00:13:06,799
Speaker 0: So they need a lot of time to go campaign.

214
00:13:07,743 --> 00:13:08,227
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

215
00:13:08,267 --> 00:13:09,195
Speaker 1: You don't have time for.

216
00:13:09,296 --> 00:13:09,800
Speaker 1: no, no, no.

217
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,508
Speaker 1: You're working.

218
00:13:10,851 --> 00:13:11,499
Speaker 1: You have a job.

219
00:13:11,985 --> 00:13:12,188
Speaker 1: Right.

220
00:13:12,229 --> 00:13:12,880
Speaker 1: No campaigning.

221
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:13,967
Speaker 1: It's not allowed.

222
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,540
Speaker 1: You can campaign from wherever you are.

223
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:15,901
Speaker 1: Right.

224
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:16,583
Speaker 1: You know.

225
00:13:16,623 --> 00:13:22,700
Speaker 0: But they're also structurally expected to spend time in their districts talking to their own people.

226
00:13:23,581 --> 00:13:23,963
Speaker 1: Yeah.

227
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:24,385
Speaker 1: You can go.

228
00:13:24,405 --> 00:13:27,398
Speaker 1: You don't have to physically be in Congress for legislating to be on.

229
00:13:28,001 --> 00:13:28,305
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

230
00:13:28,406 --> 00:13:29,298
Speaker 0: Now we get back into the work.

231
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:31,640
Speaker 1: You know, my work is still working.

232
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,423
Speaker 1: No one's there.

233
00:13:32,443 --> 00:13:33,791
Speaker 0: So it's not.

234
00:13:33,811 --> 00:13:35,520
Speaker 1: it's not like we're shutting this thing down.

235
00:13:36,402 --> 00:13:36,886
Speaker 1: We can still do.

236
00:13:37,028 --> 00:13:38,440
Speaker 1: the company is still operating.

237
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,880
Speaker 0: You realize that part of this is now a partisan issue.

238
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:49,020
Speaker 0: The Republicans specifically do not want it to be do not want anyone to be able to be in congressional sessions or vote remotely because they want things.

239
00:13:49,581 --> 00:13:51,100
Speaker 1: That's that's a separate issue.

240
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,200
Speaker 1: I'm saying is like, you know, everyone in your whole company goes on vacation.

241
00:13:54,381 --> 00:13:54,643
Speaker 1: Right.

242
00:13:54,744 --> 00:13:57,100
Speaker 1: It's like the company doesn't stop operating.

243
00:13:57,382 --> 00:13:57,604
Speaker 1: Right.

244
00:13:57,664 --> 00:13:59,220
Speaker 1: It's still doing its business.

245
00:13:59,821 --> 00:14:01,087
Speaker 1: You know, it's like there's.

246
00:14:01,127 --> 00:14:03,820
Speaker 1: no you know, my company doesn't work in sessions.

247
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:04,182
Speaker 1: Right.

248
00:14:04,263 --> 00:14:06,920
Speaker 1: Even if we get the whole week of like Christmas to New Year's off.

249
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:07,683
Speaker 1: But you know what?

250
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:11,240
Speaker 1: We can get new customers during that time, even though everyone is off.

251
00:14:11,762 --> 00:14:11,985
Speaker 1: Right.

252
00:14:12,086 --> 00:14:13,380
Speaker 1: It's like we're still operating.

253
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,259
Speaker 1: So even if no one's there because everyone's campaigning or doing other stuff.

254
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:17,923
Speaker 1: Right.

255
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:20,200
Speaker 0: It's like you realize they are shouldn't be closed.

256
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:28,380
Speaker 0: In many cases, the like what's going on when they're not in session are things like aides are working on how to draft a particular law.

257
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:29,340
Speaker 1: Right.

258
00:14:29,361 --> 00:14:33,840
Speaker 1: But I'm like if there was a law that they were like, you know, oh, we couldn't vote on the law in time.

259
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:35,337
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, no, that's never happened.

260
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:36,919
Speaker 0: That never actually happens.

261
00:14:37,282 --> 00:14:39,260
Speaker 0: That is only an excuse.

262
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,520
Speaker 0: The reality is they didn't want to pass that law.

263
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:42,507
Speaker 0: That's the only reason.

264
00:14:42,527 --> 00:14:42,829
Speaker 1: Yes.

265
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,200
Speaker 1: I'm saying remove the excuse.

266
00:14:44,421 --> 00:14:44,623
Speaker 1: Right.

267
00:14:44,703 --> 00:14:47,080
Speaker 1: It's like, no, you've got all the time to talk about the excuse.

268
00:14:47,461 --> 00:14:51,320
Speaker 0: The only thing that actually needs to change is removing the filibuster, make them piss their pants.

269
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:56,400
Speaker 1: I'm talking about even in but even in New York State, there's no filibuster in the New York State Assembly.

270
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,900
Speaker 0: Because the reality is they'd never run out of time.

271
00:14:59,081 --> 00:15:01,600
Speaker 0: There's always a provision to extend the session.

272
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:08,200
Speaker 0: The only reason the session ever ends with with a deadline preventing the passage of a bill is a bill that they were not going to pass anyway.

273
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:08,702
Speaker 1: Right.

274
00:15:08,722 --> 00:15:09,679
Speaker 1: But I'm saying is they don't.

275
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:12,100
Speaker 1: Why do you even have this time that you're extending?

276
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,520
Speaker 1: Just do away with that entirely.

277
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:14,799
Speaker 1: There is no end of the session.

278
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:18,700
Speaker 1: It's like you're in session from the moment you're elected until the moment someone else is elected.

279
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Speaker 0: So anyway, in terms of there is the good Supreme Court decision that did come down is the Supreme Court has yet again shut down challenges to Obamacare.

280
00:15:31,068 --> 00:15:33,160
Speaker 1: This wasn't really like a decision in a case.

281
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,777
Speaker 1: It wasn't one of those ones where they won't hear it.

282
00:15:35,361 --> 00:15:35,780
Speaker 1: So therefore.

283
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:42,900
Speaker 0: No, no, they concluded that the plaintiffs trying to undo the law did not have standing at all.

284
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:46,660
Speaker 0: So they once again did not rule on the material like complaints.

285
00:15:47,340 --> 00:15:48,479
Speaker 1: But that's usually how it goes.

286
00:15:48,680 --> 00:16:00,240
Speaker 0: But in this case, it's interesting because pretty much every lawsuit to try to overturn Obamacare was always introduced by Republicans and was clearly entered in bad faith because they never made a real argument.

287
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:03,130
Speaker 0: They always made really fiddly procedural arguments.

288
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,980
Speaker 0: that every time the Supreme Court said, nah, that doesn't make sense.

289
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:10,200
Speaker 1: You've got to wonder who would have standing like who has standing a private insurance company?

290
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,098
Speaker 1: Would they have standing?

291
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,320
Speaker 0: Arguably not, because a private company does not have a right to do business.

292
00:16:16,521 --> 00:16:16,781
Speaker 1: Sure.

293
00:16:16,861 --> 00:16:24,260
Speaker 0: So it's like who even who could even have said, yeah, you know what, nobody, because every one of those lawsuits was complete horseshit.

294
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:25,341
Speaker 1: Yeah.

295
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:29,020
Speaker 1: I mean, while those lawsuits were horseshit, that's another thing that's always bothered me.

296
00:16:29,281 --> 00:16:34,260
Speaker 1: Is like the idea that you have to have standing or be wronged to bring a case.

297
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:39,920
Speaker 1: It's like if I'm bringing a case against an individual person because I want damages, then it obviously makes sense to have standing.

298
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:40,201
Speaker 1: Right.

299
00:16:40,261 --> 00:16:49,680
Speaker 0: It's like if you didn't hurt me, why am I so actually that what you're about to argue against is the only reason Obamacare still exists, because the one of the deepest traditions of American.

300
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:49,940
Speaker 0: Yes.

301
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:59,980
Speaker 0: And even to a point, British common law is the idea that you cannot sue someone if you if there is not either redress or harm of some kind.

302
00:17:00,721 --> 00:17:00,942
Speaker 1: Yeah.

303
00:17:01,082 --> 00:17:06,960
Speaker 1: But I feel like, you know, while it would be harmful to Obamacare in this case, right.

304
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:18,680
Speaker 1: If I see that the government has passed a law and I believe that law is unconstitutional and we've decided to that courts have the ability to rule things unconstitutional, which is something you can debate.

305
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:20,440
Speaker 1: Which I'm not going to get into here.

306
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:21,281
Speaker 1: Right.

307
00:17:21,342 --> 00:17:23,800
Speaker 1: So, you know, some people might argue that maybe that was wrong.

308
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,377
Speaker 1: They don't shouldn't be able to do that.

309
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:29,184
Speaker 1: But if you're going to say that they can do that, then I should be able to.

310
00:17:29,224 --> 00:17:42,900
Speaker 1: just any person who is a citizen or is subject to that law should be able, even if they have not been harmed and don't don't seek any way that should just be able to go to court and say, listen, you pass this.

311
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,280
Speaker 1: I think that law is unconstitutional.

312
00:17:44,642 --> 00:17:45,769
Speaker 1: And I want to argue that it is.

313
00:17:45,789 --> 00:17:47,400
Speaker 1: it doesn't affect me in any way.

314
00:17:47,581 --> 00:17:50,500
Speaker 1: Other than that, I'm subject to that law because I'm a citizen of this country.

315
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:51,341
Speaker 1: Right.

316
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,740
Speaker 1: I don't need to have that's all the standing you need for for that particular thing.

317
00:17:55,020 --> 00:18:00,180
Speaker 0: Well, we can argue that maybe suing a person, I'm just constitutional challenges should be different.

318
00:18:00,681 --> 00:18:06,100
Speaker 0: And in many cases, you could get standing in that case if you could show that that law could have material.

319
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:07,293
Speaker 0: There's there's a whole complicated.

320
00:18:07,313 --> 00:18:07,860
Speaker 0: I'm not a lawyer.

321
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,081
Speaker 1: Right.

322
00:18:08,101 --> 00:18:11,199
Speaker 1: But I'm saying even if the law had nothing like nothing the fuck to do with me.

323
00:18:11,581 --> 00:18:11,743
Speaker 1: Right.

324
00:18:11,843 --> 00:18:14,039
Speaker 1: It's like all that matters is I'm a citizen in the end.

325
00:18:14,161 --> 00:18:14,384
Speaker 1: Right.

326
00:18:14,486 --> 00:18:15,380
Speaker 1: Therefore, it's a law.

327
00:18:15,441 --> 00:18:16,018
Speaker 1: That's all I need.

328
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:22,070
Speaker 0: So a consequence clearly not the case, a consequence of that would probably be not.

329
00:18:23,052 --> 00:18:28,040
Speaker 0: jobs would be filing lawsuits constantly and sovereign citizens would be a much bigger problem than they are today.

330
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:29,261
Speaker 1: That's true.

331
00:18:30,042 --> 00:18:40,580
Speaker 0: So in this case, it's actually more interesting because the lawsuit was saying that Obamacare was technically a tax and therefore it's unconstitutional.

332
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,760
Speaker 0: It included a tax, but it didn't follow.

333
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,359
Speaker 1: Congress has the power to tax, though.

334
00:18:44,924 --> 00:18:46,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to get into why this was.

335
00:18:47,401 --> 00:18:49,120
Speaker 0: It's because they passed it in reconciliation.

336
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:53,660
Speaker 0: Remember that the Democrats pulled ridiculous shenanigans to pass Obamacare.

337
00:18:55,301 --> 00:19:01,660
Speaker 0: So those shenanigans are part of why these lawsuits all came up, because no Republicans would back it and they had to get around the filibuster.

338
00:19:02,501 --> 00:19:06,220
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons why, like the voting rights law can't do the same shenanigans.

339
00:19:06,661 --> 00:19:19,460
Speaker 0: But anyway, so in this case, Congress got around that problem in twenty seventeen by changing the tax if that you would pay if you didn't have insurance to zero dollars.

340
00:19:21,283 --> 00:19:23,279
Speaker 0: So the lawsuit was saying it's tax.

341
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:27,620
Speaker 0: The Supreme Court ruled a tax of zero dollars is immaterial.

342
00:19:28,103 --> 00:19:28,847
Speaker 0: It doesn't make sense.

343
00:19:29,109 --> 00:19:29,491
Speaker 0: It's not.

344
00:19:29,632 --> 00:19:30,940
Speaker 0: you can't sue if you don't have standing.

345
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:33,800
Speaker 0: In this case, it's you can't sue about nothing.

346
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:35,366
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

347
00:19:35,527 --> 00:19:36,880
Speaker 0: You can't sue someone in bad faith.

348
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:39,118
Speaker 0: You can't sue someone for literally nothing.

349
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:43,880
Speaker 0: So at this point, Obamacare has probably survived.

350
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:47,440
Speaker 0: And that's good because Obamacare is saving a lot of lives.

351
00:19:48,105 --> 00:19:49,039
Speaker 1: But it's not good enough.

352
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:49,501
Speaker 0: Nope.

353
00:19:49,581 --> 00:19:52,740
Speaker 0: We need universal health care and the filibuster, et cetera, communism.

354
00:19:53,080 --> 00:20:00,120
Speaker 0: But anyway, the ruling that was what about the bad, the bad ruling, the bad ruling, probably the worst ruling.

355
00:20:00,562 --> 00:20:02,619
Speaker 0: So I'm going to super summarize this.

356
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:19,180
Speaker 0: Basically, the Philadelphia wanted to exclude one foster care organization from the organizations that it works with and supports to get orphans into foster homes or children who are taken away from abusive parents into foster homes.

357
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,900
Speaker 1: So so the state of Philadelphia gets has some children, right?

358
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,140
Speaker 1: Children that have, you know, been, you know, for whatever reason, lost their been orphaned somehow.

359
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,426
Speaker 0: Whatever they want to.

360
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:30,579
Speaker 0: They want to put this child in a foster home.

361
00:20:31,303 --> 00:20:34,500
Speaker 1: And the state doesn't have a state place to put the city, right?

362
00:20:35,260 --> 00:20:36,125
Speaker 0: Philadelphia.

363
00:20:36,165 --> 00:20:39,100
Speaker 1: So the city doesn't have a city orphanage, right?

364
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:42,880
Speaker 1: They have other foster organizations they work with to bring the children to.

365
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:58,400
Speaker 0: So because there is a Catholic organization that they work with, could work with, but that organization will not in any way allow a non-straight family to adopt a kid.

366
00:20:59,001 --> 00:21:00,520
Speaker 0: They exclude anyone who is gay.

367
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:01,996
Speaker 1: OK.

368
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:04,800
Speaker 0: Like, full stop, it is just blatantly discriminatory.

369
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,660
Speaker 0: They get away with this because they're a religious organization.

370
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:17,440
Speaker 0: Philadelphia said, well, you're welcome to keep existing under your First Amendment rights, but we will not work with you because that is discriminatory.

371
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:28,480
Speaker 0: The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that Philadelphia cannot refuse to work with them on the basis of that discrimination because that discrimination is a protected religious right.

372
00:21:29,343 --> 00:21:30,720
Speaker 1: Well, that's just 100 percent wrong.

373
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,001
Speaker 0: Yep.

374
00:21:31,141 --> 00:21:34,740
Speaker 0: It was a unanimous decision because America is terrible.

375
00:21:34,961 --> 00:21:35,840
Speaker 0: I don't know what to say about it.

376
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:41,020
Speaker 1: So in that case, you're basically saying that the let me just take that to its extreme.

377
00:21:41,381 --> 00:21:44,619
Speaker 0: Oh, the extreme is actually exactly what the Republicans are shooting for here.

378
00:21:45,581 --> 00:21:53,040
Speaker 1: Well, OK, so the extreme is that I create the Scott's Satanist orphanage and it's like Philadelphia.

379
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:58,780
Speaker 1: I have created an orphanage and I am following all the standards for, you know, an orphanage.

380
00:21:58,861 --> 00:21:59,043
Speaker 1: Right.

381
00:21:59,124 --> 00:22:00,300
Speaker 1: It's like I'm taking care of the children.

382
00:22:00,421 --> 00:22:02,358
Speaker 1: Well, right, et cetera, et cetera.

383
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:09,200
Speaker 1: In my Satanist pagan orphanage, you because I exist, you must send children to me.

384
00:22:09,564 --> 00:22:10,619
Speaker 1: You have no choice.

385
00:22:11,003 --> 00:22:12,699
Speaker 1: You just know you can't discriminate against me.

386
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,321
Speaker 1: You have to.

387
00:22:13,942 --> 00:22:22,560
Speaker 1: The government is now forced to do business with this organization because I have created it and there is no way to discriminate against my organization because the Supreme Court said so.

388
00:22:22,962 --> 00:22:24,219
Speaker 1: So now I can set up businesses.

389
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,342
Speaker 1: Right.

390
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:27,720
Speaker 1: That and the government must do business with me.

391
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,565
Speaker 1: No bidding needed.

392
00:22:28,665 --> 00:22:31,160
Speaker 1: I just had to be within have no other reason.

393
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:39,540
Speaker 1: Legitimate reason, you know, that I guess, you know, discrimination is a legitimate reason, obviously, morally, but not legally, according to the Supreme Court today.

394
00:22:40,322 --> 00:22:43,720
Speaker 1: So well, the real force the government to send me children.

395
00:22:44,021 --> 00:22:52,760
Speaker 0: We do have no choice or Church of Satan type things to fight this because the real end game here is a long term, like decade long strategy.

396
00:22:53,281 --> 00:23:09,878
Speaker 0: You've probably seen a lot of news about this recently where Republicans are increasingly using the First Amendment and religious freedom to ensure that closely held, terrible, violent racist beliefs can be protected under the First Amendment so that organizations that are ostensibly religious

397
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:10,579
Speaker 1: can basically

398
00:23:10,599 --> 00:23:11,400
Speaker 0: do whatever the fuck they want.

399
00:23:12,501 --> 00:23:20,940
Speaker 0: And that is how conservatives are going to try to get around anti-discrimination laws, that if we ever get rid of the filibuster, we can start passing more frequently.

400
00:23:22,621 --> 00:23:25,700
Speaker 0: And it's another fundamental flaw of America that I don't know how we fix.

401
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:27,420
Speaker 0: This is a terrible ruling.

402
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:35,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, my interpretation, right, if I was the judge would be like, look, you know, freedom of speech, it's the First Amendment.

403
00:23:35,741 --> 00:23:37,280
Speaker 1: You can go around saying.

404
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:38,441
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

405
00:23:38,461 --> 00:23:43,300
Speaker 0: Remember, the First Amendment also specifically includes freedom of religion, freedom of assembly, freedom of all these other things.

406
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,818
Speaker 0: Speech was not the issue here.

407
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:53,960
Speaker 1: Yes, freedom of religion, meaning you are free to light your menorah and read your Bible and, you know, practice your religion.

408
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:54,760
Speaker 1: Right.

409
00:23:54,820 --> 00:23:56,664
Speaker 1: But in this case, right, not.

410
00:23:56,744 --> 00:24:04,360
Speaker 1: choosing to, you know, giving children to a foster home is not a religious practice that you are free to do.

411
00:24:04,560 --> 00:24:05,740
Speaker 1: It is something that you are choosing.

412
00:24:06,244 --> 00:24:07,680
Speaker 0: I would go one step further.

413
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:11,820
Speaker 0: The real solution to this is there shouldn't be as such thing as a religious organization.

414
00:24:12,541 --> 00:24:13,947
Speaker 0: Any church should be.

415
00:24:13,967 --> 00:24:16,720
Speaker 0: it should just have to be a nonprofit or a for profit.

416
00:24:16,902 --> 00:24:17,790
Speaker 0: They could be for profit.

417
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:18,699
Speaker 0: I'm totally fine with that.

418
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:20,520
Speaker 0: Just regulated like any other company.

419
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:21,620
Speaker 0: No exception.

420
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,561
Speaker 1: I mean, I never.

421
00:24:22,641 --> 00:24:38,200
Speaker 1: I also never understood that if we have separation of church and state, then, you know, the fact that religious organizations have any special difference between it from any other organization, I would say the government should also not be allowed to work with any religious organization for any purpose.

422
00:24:38,963 --> 00:24:40,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that's not separation of church and state.

423
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:44,180
Speaker 0: And it would be fair if they just said we will not work with any religious group.

424
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:44,925
Speaker 0: Full stop.

425
00:24:45,168 --> 00:24:45,999
Speaker 1: Yeah, period.

426
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,919
Speaker 1: I wonder if Philadelphia did that.

427
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:53,600
Speaker 1: You know, they might have a shortage of places to send orphans.

428
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,320
Speaker 0: That's a big problem here.

429
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:56,221
Speaker 0: Yeah.

430
00:24:56,582 --> 00:25:00,760
Speaker 1: Well, part of this is because the book would they get away, but would they get away with it if they did that?

431
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:04,780
Speaker 1: They decided only secular places.

432
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:14,700
Speaker 0: The Catholic Church is so big and runs so many different charities and things that this ruling is dangerous, dangerous for a lot of reasons, because a lot of places don't have other organizations local they could work with.

433
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:26,040
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know, in this case, right, Philadelphia is saying we're going to allow children to go to like, you know, the Jewish orphanage, the Muslim orphanage, you know, the other Christian orphanage, the Protestant one, but not that Catholic one.

434
00:25:26,381 --> 00:25:26,582
Speaker 1: Right.

435
00:25:26,622 --> 00:25:30,980
Speaker 1: And I think that's just, you know, there is, I guess, a legal argument for that being right.

436
00:25:31,881 --> 00:25:36,880
Speaker 1: But if Philadelphia just said no religious orphanages, that might fly, maybe.

437
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:37,284
Speaker 1: I don't know.

438
00:25:37,324 --> 00:25:37,770
Speaker 1: Not a lawyer.

439
00:25:37,932 --> 00:25:38,520
Speaker 1: I'm just guessing.

440
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:39,420
Speaker 0: Yeah.

441
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:53,160
Speaker 0: Basically, this law, this ruling is going to make it a lot easier for private organizations to cite that they have a religious or spiritual or personal belief and then refuse clients and discriminate openly and get around every anti-discrimination law.

442
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,000
Speaker 0: This is a big slippery slope.

443
00:25:56,021 --> 00:25:56,202
Speaker 1: Right.

444
00:25:56,363 --> 00:25:59,200
Speaker 1: Until the government gets his shit together, if that ever happens.

445
00:25:59,340 --> 00:25:59,561
Speaker 1: Right.

446
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:05,600
Speaker 1: I think the thing that we can do is like I was in my Satan orphanage example is to weaponize the reverse.

447
00:26:05,862 --> 00:26:06,808
Speaker 1: Right.

448
00:26:06,909 --> 00:26:07,553
Speaker 1: Come up with.

449
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:08,319
Speaker 1: it's been successful.

450
00:26:09,163 --> 00:26:11,717
Speaker 0: The church of Satan that that is successfully forced.

451
00:26:12,420 --> 00:26:13,185
Speaker 1: It has other issues.

452
00:26:13,407 --> 00:26:15,139
Speaker 1: The actual organization church of Satan.

453
00:26:15,420 --> 00:26:20,620
Speaker 0: Well, there's a good satanic church and there's the kind of fucked up one.

454
00:26:20,801 --> 00:26:22,360
Speaker 0: I forget which one is which every time.

455
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,579
Speaker 1: But regardless, you just come up with things you can do that are good.

456
00:26:28,121 --> 00:26:28,442
Speaker 1: Right.

457
00:26:28,744 --> 00:26:32,680
Speaker 1: That are and may decide that those are your religious beliefs.

458
00:26:33,125 --> 00:26:33,389
Speaker 1: Right.

459
00:26:33,430 --> 00:26:33,998
Speaker 1: Good things.

460
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:36,319
Speaker 1: The trans rights of human rights.

461
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,440
Speaker 0: That's my religious belief.

462
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:39,000
Speaker 1: Yeah.

463
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,243
Speaker 1: And be like, you know, that's.

464
00:26:40,503 --> 00:26:49,280
Speaker 1: and then when they come to get you, you can cite these cases and be like, no, you know, it's like we give our orphan kids.

465
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:56,300
Speaker 1: We only give them to two families with at least, you know, with one non straight, you know, parent or whatever.

466
00:26:56,420 --> 00:26:56,561
Speaker 1: Right.

467
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:58,393
Speaker 1: And it's like you have to give us children.

468
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:04,960
Speaker 0: I'd say if the Catholic Church is hiring someone for a job in the church, they can't require that person be Catholic.

469
00:27:06,461 --> 00:27:07,428
Speaker 0: That would be discriminatory.

470
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,799
Speaker 0: I would say that's how it should go.

471
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,299
Speaker 1: You could you know, why would you want to work there?

472
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

473
00:27:12,083 --> 00:27:13,300
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, why do you want to work there?

474
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:17,300
Speaker 0: A lot of people have jobs because they need to eat because capitalism has destroyed the world.

475
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:18,262
Speaker 1: Right.

476
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:23,060
Speaker 0: Anyway, the only the fundamental problem is still we have to undo the filibuster.

477
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:27,080
Speaker 0: So I'm curious, one, do any of you listening to this live in West Virginia?

478
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:27,963
Speaker 0: I'm just curious.

479
00:27:28,385 --> 00:27:31,919
Speaker 0: I would not be surprised if we have zero listeners in West Virginia.

480
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:34,119
Speaker 1: Is there people in West Virginia?

481
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:35,800
Speaker 0: It's the whitest state in America.

482
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:36,902
Speaker 0: Like, it's terrifying.

483
00:27:37,363 --> 00:27:44,779
Speaker 0: But, too, if you do live in West Virginia, call Joe Manchin every goddamn day because you are literally the only people on earth who he will listen to.

484
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:48,659
Speaker 0: And you and you have undue influence over the world right now.

485
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:51,960
Speaker 0: So if you live there, call that motherfucker every goddamn day.

486
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:52,837
Speaker 1: Pretend to live there?

487
00:27:53,160 --> 00:27:55,500
Speaker 0: No, they actually verify that pretty well.

488
00:27:55,800 --> 00:28:06,840
Speaker 0: And a lot of politicians will use data showing that people who are not their constituents are calling them as an excuse to pointedly ignore and say that, oh, my constituents are with me.

489
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,837
Speaker 0: These people are all fake.

490
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:15,700
Speaker 1: We can maybe find a way to impersonate and convince you because you're just calling on a phone number.

491
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:16,081
Speaker 1: Right.

492
00:28:16,604 --> 00:28:19,800
Speaker 1: You know, we somehow convinced them that we're actually the constituents.

493
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:24,258
Speaker 0: I called what's his name upstate because I bought my cell phones in the area code and shoot him out a while ago.

494
00:28:26,002 --> 00:28:27,640
Speaker 0: Anyway, last little bit of news.

495
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:32,500
Speaker 0: I don't know if you noticed, but Batman was trending nationally on Twitter.

496
00:28:33,041 --> 00:28:40,540
Speaker 0: And what I love about this is that it was one of those situations where I saw people reacting to something but didn't see the thing.

497
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,140
Speaker 1: But based on the reaction, I saw the reactions well before I saw the thing.

498
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:52,080
Speaker 0: But the reactions I saw at first confused me more and actually drove me to where I wanted to know what the real deal was.

499
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,178
Speaker 0: It's pretty easy to figure out.

500
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,424
Speaker 0: Basically, experience.

501
00:28:55,966 --> 00:29:00,880
Speaker 0: DC has a policy saying that heroes cannot perform cuddlingus.

502
00:29:00,940 --> 00:29:01,698
Speaker 0: Only villains can.

503
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:06,540
Speaker 0: Like kind of literally you can read this article.

504
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:15,860
Speaker 0: I don't know what else to say about that, except there is only one part of Batman that is exposed in his entire goddamn costume.

505
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:17,600
Speaker 0: I feel like that's for a reason.

506
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:19,135
Speaker 0: And I feel like DC is wrong here.

507
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:29,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to know more about superheroes and sexuality, there's a Twitter account called I don't know if we talked about this on the show, the Claremont Run.

508
00:29:29,821 --> 00:29:37,400
Speaker 1: So pretty much the the X-Men comics that you care about are is the Claremont Run, which is, you know, Dark Phoenix Saga, right?

509
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,759
Speaker 1: All those those those X-Men comics, right?

510
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:42,700
Speaker 1: Mostly written by Claremont, right?

511
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,479
Speaker 1: John Claremont, who is a very cool person.

512
00:29:45,661 --> 00:29:50,880
Speaker 1: And there's someone in Canada who's basically working at like a university and got a grant or whatever.

513
00:29:51,441 --> 00:29:56,820
Speaker 1: And their whole thing is studying the Claremont Run, like deep, deep diving.

514
00:29:56,941 --> 00:30:00,600
Speaker 1: And every single day in the morning, they post a Twitter thread.

515
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:03,600
Speaker 1: They also have videos on their YouTube channel like that.

516
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,860
Speaker 1: Like they're just nonstop like they never run out of things to say about it.

517
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:17,520
Speaker 1: And of course, since it's X-Men, there is a lot of commentary about sexuality and, you know, people wearing underwear outside the rest of their clothes.

518
00:30:19,301 --> 00:30:26,560
Speaker 1: And so if you read that right, you'll have a very good understanding of, you know, angles on pretty much every other.

519
00:30:27,122 --> 00:30:30,199
Speaker 1: Character who wears underwear on the outside of their clothes, like Batman and Superman.

520
00:30:34,821 --> 00:30:37,880
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

521
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,880
Speaker 0: So I try not to reuse channels because, you know, that's the thing.

522
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:49,900
Speaker 0: Like, I like Scott, we could just do lock picking Laura like every goddamn week forever or tech mode or any one of those channels.

523
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:55,959
Speaker 0: But Joel Haver is a gentleman and he has made like some fantastic YouTube content.

524
00:30:56,861 --> 00:31:00,660
Speaker 0: Remember that animation of the adventure guy going off, like that kind of thing.

525
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,560
Speaker 0: But this video, it's topical to our show topic tonight.

526
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:08,860
Speaker 0: It is entitled Dad's Checking Into Their Hotel Room.

527
00:31:09,881 --> 00:31:13,880
Speaker 0: Not only do I find this hilarious, but when I saw this video, me and Emily were sitting on the couch.

528
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,559
Speaker 0: We were like watching it before we watched our real show.

529
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:20,840
Speaker 0: And when they get to the point of looking at the paintings, Emily just looks at me and starts laughing.

530
00:31:20,921 --> 00:31:22,080
Speaker 0: And she's like, this is you and Scott.

531
00:31:22,201 --> 00:31:23,539
Speaker 0: Every time we check into a fucking hotel.

532
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,007
Speaker 0: Every time.

533
00:31:25,068 --> 00:31:26,237
Speaker 0: Maybe it kind of is.

534
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:27,943
Speaker 0: This is us.

535
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:32,240
Speaker 0: This say, look at this painting over here.

536
00:31:32,381 --> 00:31:33,210
Speaker 0: Oh, look at that.

537
00:31:33,231 --> 00:31:33,979
Speaker 0: This is a museum.

538
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:35,880
Speaker 0: Hey, it's a pool in this building.

539
00:31:36,241 --> 00:31:36,664
Speaker 0: Hey, yo.

540
00:31:37,955 --> 00:31:38,560
Speaker 1: Some of it's us.

541
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:39,287
Speaker 1: Some of it's not.

542
00:31:39,408 --> 00:31:40,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, some of it's not us.

543
00:31:40,420 --> 00:31:44,840
Speaker 0: It's definitely it's adjacent to how we how we interact with hotels.

544
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:45,707
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

545
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,100
Speaker 1: I mean, I found I realized that I sent you my link for the thing of the day, but it wasn't there.

546
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:52,216
Speaker 1: So here, here and here it is.

547
00:31:53,660 --> 00:32:01,960
Speaker 1: OK, so somebody who is this person ZZainhip on GitHub has made something really amazing.

548
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:02,541
Speaker 1: Right.

549
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:07,620
Speaker 1: So when it comes to old computers, right, we can generally emulate them.

550
00:32:07,781 --> 00:32:10,840
Speaker 1: And, you know, the interface for them is keyboard, maybe mouse.

551
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:11,183
Speaker 1: Right.

552
00:32:11,203 --> 00:32:13,160
Speaker 1: So you can get a mount monitor.

553
00:32:13,622 --> 00:32:18,180
Speaker 1: And even though you don't have a CRT, you can get a pretty close approximation of old computer.

554
00:32:18,602 --> 00:32:18,864
Speaker 1: Right.

555
00:32:19,207 --> 00:32:20,980
Speaker 1: Or old, old game console.

556
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,903
Speaker 1: You emulate that.

557
00:32:21,943 --> 00:32:26,460
Speaker 1: you can get a pretty close approximation of old game console by emulating it.

558
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:26,740
Speaker 1: Right.

559
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,782
Speaker 1: Yeah.

560
00:32:28,123 --> 00:32:38,140
Speaker 1: If you want to emulate old smartphone, you can't really, you know, get a great approximation unless you do it on the smartphone.

561
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:38,862
Speaker 1: Right.

562
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:43,360
Speaker 1: It's like and specifically, you know, let's say you want to do it.

563
00:32:43,581 --> 00:32:44,471
Speaker 1: It's only 10.

564
00:32:44,471 --> 00:32:45,280
Speaker 1: You know, how old is it?

565
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,109
Speaker 1: Fourteen years old.

566
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:46,880
Speaker 1: The first iPhone.

567
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:47,221
Speaker 1: Right.

568
00:32:47,661 --> 00:32:57,800
Speaker 1: If you want to experience iPhone one or, you know, the first iPhone 3G as it was in 2008 or whatever, it's without actually getting one of those phones.

569
00:32:58,023 --> 00:32:59,018
Speaker 1: That's hard to do.

570
00:32:59,961 --> 00:33:05,260
Speaker 1: There's no way I know to downgrade a phone once it's been and a lot of them got updated to newer iOS versions over time.

571
00:33:06,741 --> 00:33:14,660
Speaker 1: And even if you emulate it, you you're not emulating it on a full touch screen device like, you know, it's not very.

572
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:17,040
Speaker 1: So this person did something really amazing.

573
00:33:17,703 --> 00:33:19,659
Speaker 1: They created an iPhone app.

574
00:33:19,943 --> 00:33:21,300
Speaker 1: You can't buy in the app store.

575
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:25,660
Speaker 1: You would need to like, you know, use the typical shenanigans to get it onto your phone.

576
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:29,200
Speaker 1: But it's an iPhone app written in Swift.

577
00:33:29,761 --> 00:33:30,001
Speaker 1: Right.

578
00:33:30,603 --> 00:33:31,184
Speaker 1: So it's really.

579
00:33:31,304 --> 00:33:37,960
Speaker 1: if you look at the source code, the open source source code for this app, you can learn a lot about programming for the iPhone.

580
00:33:39,581 --> 00:33:44,456
Speaker 1: And it's basically you open this app and the app is the old iPhone.

581
00:33:47,542 --> 00:33:53,013
Speaker 1: So it's like you're going to be if you installed this on your phone, you'd be sitting there looking at iOS 14, 15, whatever.

582
00:33:53,314 --> 00:33:55,960
Speaker 1: you open the app and suddenly you're looking at iOS one.

583
00:33:57,544 --> 00:33:59,380
Speaker 1: And all the apps in there mostly work.

584
00:33:59,621 --> 00:34:04,860
Speaker 1: And it's very close to pixel perfect compared to the original iPhones.

585
00:34:06,742 --> 00:34:09,460
Speaker 1: It's really quite astonishing what they managed to accomplish here.

586
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:11,840
Speaker 1: So I'm liking this.

587
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:23,840
Speaker 1: Like, you know, I think that would actually be a really cool is like if instead of like opening VirtualBox and then running Windows 95, if you just literally had Windows 95.exe and you double clicked on it and you ran it full screen.

588
00:34:24,504 --> 00:34:24,991
Speaker 1: And there you go.

589
00:34:25,031 --> 00:34:26,000
Speaker 1: It's Windows 95.

590
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,000
Speaker 1: That's not an emulator.

591
00:34:27,366 --> 00:34:28,099
Speaker 1: It's just an app.

592
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:29,907
Speaker 1: Right.

593
00:34:30,853 --> 00:34:31,560
Speaker 1: So that's what this is.

594
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:32,659
Speaker 1: It's pretty awesome, actually.

595
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,862
Speaker 1: And I like that.

596
00:34:33,983 --> 00:34:41,158
Speaker 1: it's preserving something that has a higher chance, I think, of being lost because who was thinking about preserving that?

597
00:34:41,178 --> 00:34:42,219
Speaker 1: because it doesn't feel that old.

598
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:50,380
Speaker 1: But actually it is in bad need of preserving because how many iPhone ones and three G's are out there that are still working and not too many.

599
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:51,141
Speaker 0: Yeah.

600
00:34:51,221 --> 00:34:59,300
Speaker 0: And especially imagine 30, 40, 50 years ago, this will be important for researchers and historians, this kind of information, just like with video game preservation.

601
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:09,960
Speaker 1: Also, I didn't realize, like, you know, you tend to have this like Windows 95 is like this UI and this experience that's like really baked in to, you know, in my life or whatever.

602
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:10,561
Speaker 1: Right.

603
00:35:10,581 --> 00:35:17,720
Speaker 1: And the minds of people who used it that I had an iPhone three G, but then I upped only for two years, then had iPhone four and then had iPhone five.

604
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,381
Speaker 1: Right.

605
00:35:18,441 --> 00:35:28,620
Speaker 1: And so I didn't stick, you know, but so it wasn't like baked into my life experience, this old UI that, you know, was completely different from what we have now with its.

606
00:35:29,944 --> 00:35:31,219
Speaker 1: You know, what, what did they call it?

607
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:32,464
Speaker 1: The what's the word for it?

608
00:35:32,484 --> 00:35:36,360
Speaker 1: where you make stuff that looks like real materials, the air sets.

609
00:35:38,106 --> 00:35:39,139
Speaker 1: No, I said word.

610
00:35:40,202 --> 00:35:41,429
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what.

611
00:35:41,449 --> 00:35:43,259
Speaker 1: No, what the hell is that word?

612
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:44,245
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

613
00:35:44,266 --> 00:35:46,020
Speaker 1: Someone someone out there is yelling the word.

614
00:35:46,601 --> 00:35:52,440
Speaker 1: You know, it's when you when you design like you're making an app and you make like what it looks like wood, even though it's software.

615
00:35:52,702 --> 00:35:52,985
Speaker 1: Right.

616
00:35:53,005 --> 00:35:54,017
Speaker 1: You know, that kind of thing.

617
00:35:55,722 --> 00:36:00,140
Speaker 1: But anyway, that's what iPhone one, you know, iPhone three G, that's the UI they had.

618
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:00,481
Speaker 1: Right.

619
00:36:00,602 --> 00:36:03,480
Speaker 1: And I didn't realize, like, how I had forgotten it.

620
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,900
Speaker 0: And as soon as I saw it, I was like, whoa, I realized I was thinking back because my first smartphone was actually a Palm device.

621
00:36:09,501 --> 00:36:18,380
Speaker 0: I cannot remember what anything looked like in that entire UI, except the integrated chat stream.

622
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:25,960
Speaker 0: The one good thing that Palm had, where my communications with a person across all the apps would be in one stream.

623
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:28,680
Speaker 1: Oh, skeuomorphic, skeuomorphic design.

624
00:36:28,801 --> 00:36:29,814
Speaker 0: OK, OK, OK.

625
00:36:30,097 --> 00:36:30,259
Speaker 1: Yeah.

626
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:38,720
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, in the moment, we're going to be live at PAX East online twenty twenty one with a brand new panel.

627
00:36:39,064 --> 00:36:40,339
Speaker 0: That wallet is the same topic.

628
00:36:40,562 --> 00:36:42,020
Speaker 1: Is it actually brand new, though?

629
00:36:42,281 --> 00:36:45,600
Speaker 0: Well, it's a totally different new slide deck with new talking points.

630
00:36:45,922 --> 00:36:48,360
Speaker 0: And it is also a completely different set of Atari games.

631
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:52,120
Speaker 0: So back in twenty sixteen, we did a panel and we did this in a few counts.

632
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:56,680
Speaker 0: It was pretty popular called Atari Game Design, where we talk about Atari Game Design a little bit.

633
00:36:56,760 --> 00:37:01,459
Speaker 0: We did a thing and then we just play multiplayer Atari games and go deep into their crap.

634
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,757
Speaker 1: We did this one time, I think.

635
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:05,639
Speaker 0: No, we did it three times.

636
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,500
Speaker 1: I remember doing it zero.

637
00:37:11,703 --> 00:37:13,580
Speaker 1: It feels like it's like, let's do this panel again.

638
00:37:13,601 --> 00:37:14,119
Speaker 1: And I'm like, what?

639
00:37:15,121 --> 00:37:21,060
Speaker 0: I think the difference is because I do the producer work for Geek Nights, like I manage our appearances, schedule and all that.

640
00:37:21,401 --> 00:37:24,180
Speaker 0: So I have a little local database of every panel we've ever done.

641
00:37:24,661 --> 00:37:28,592
Speaker 0: And also I get the stats like this is one of the panels we uploaded to YouTube in twenty sixteen.

642
00:37:28,973 --> 00:37:31,320
Speaker 0: that gets consistently watched to this day a lot.

643
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Speaker 0: It was also one of the few panels we did that filled the room every time we did it.

644
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:48,199
Speaker 0: So there was a big energy in the room that we often don't get now because very few panels that are giving something away fill up at pretty much any convention anymore, giving away something or announcing some AAA property.

645
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:55,200
Speaker 0: But anyway, this version of the panel talks about a different area of the game design.

646
00:37:55,440 --> 00:38:04,980
Speaker 0: And we focus on single player games and especially the demake or degraded version of arcade games that were ported to the twenty six hundred.

647
00:38:05,881 --> 00:38:07,960
Speaker 0: So this will never have been seen before.

648
00:38:08,081 --> 00:38:09,680
Speaker 0: It's like 90 percent new content.

649
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:11,445
Speaker 0: It'll be at one forty five p.m.

650
00:38:11,485 --> 00:38:16,140
Speaker 0: Eastern Time on Saturday, July 17th in the PAX to Twitch stream.

651
00:38:16,663 --> 00:38:18,300
Speaker 0: And we'll be hanging out in the PAX discord.

652
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,780
Speaker 0: If you have any questions, discord, discord.

653
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,800
Speaker 1: Oh, it's going to be on Twitch.

654
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:25,300
Speaker 0: OK, we'll be on Twitch, but I will find the Twitch chat and the discord chat.

655
00:38:25,401 --> 00:38:28,540
Speaker 0: And I assume there's a YouTube stream that maybe I'll hang out in.

656
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:28,901
Speaker 0: We'll see.

657
00:38:30,911 --> 00:38:32,357
Speaker 1: I'm up in other meta, right?

658
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,625
Speaker 1: Other conventions.

659
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:37,460
Speaker 1: so far, we don't know if and when they're happening.

660
00:38:37,704 --> 00:38:37,908
Speaker 1: Right.

661
00:38:37,929 --> 00:38:38,419
Speaker 1: For sure.

662
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:47,000
Speaker 1: But I just want to reiterate that we are having a policy here at geek nights of if a convention is safe to have.

663
00:38:47,221 --> 00:38:49,180
Speaker 1: Obviously, we want to go to a convention, right?

664
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:50,480
Speaker 1: I haven't been to a convention in forever.

665
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:52,596
Speaker 1: I want to go to a convention and play board games all day.

666
00:38:52,636 --> 00:38:53,059
Speaker 1: real bad.

667
00:38:53,761 --> 00:38:56,860
Speaker 1: But if a convention is going to require masks.

668
00:38:57,242 --> 00:38:57,605
Speaker 1: All right.

669
00:38:57,908 --> 00:38:59,180
Speaker 1: I'm not saying that's a bad idea.

670
00:38:59,461 --> 00:38:59,642
Speaker 1: Right.

671
00:38:59,702 --> 00:39:03,640
Speaker 1: It's like obviously masks are good and you have safety precautions.

672
00:39:04,462 --> 00:39:04,703
Speaker 0: Right.

673
00:39:04,723 --> 00:39:08,180
Speaker 1: But if you know the analogy, I just keep going back to.

674
00:39:08,381 --> 00:39:11,240
Speaker 1: Is someone so confident that plane is safe?

675
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:14,800
Speaker 1: Why are they telling me that I have to wear a parachute at all times?

676
00:39:14,941 --> 00:39:16,860
Speaker 1: It's like I just won't get on that plane.

677
00:39:17,343 --> 00:39:19,280
Speaker 1: It's like maybe you want to get on that plane.

678
00:39:19,641 --> 00:39:20,245
Speaker 1: OK, right.

679
00:39:20,265 --> 00:39:22,580
Speaker 1: The parachute is going to help you increase safety.

680
00:39:22,903 --> 00:39:23,147
Speaker 1: Right.

681
00:39:23,533 --> 00:39:23,899
Speaker 1: I'm sure.

682
00:39:25,702 --> 00:39:28,199
Speaker 1: But if you tell me the plane is safe, you're so confident in it.

683
00:39:28,682 --> 00:39:30,900
Speaker 1: Why are you making everyone wear a parachute at all times?

684
00:39:31,082 --> 00:39:32,800
Speaker 1: Is it really safe to get on that plane?

685
00:39:33,143 --> 00:39:34,419
Speaker 1: I've lost confidence now.

686
00:39:34,821 --> 00:39:44,400
Speaker 1: So if you tell me the convention is safe, but you're having limited attendance and you're having masks required, then any social rules inside of the convention.

687
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:45,542
Speaker 1: Yeah.

688
00:39:45,663 --> 00:39:52,741
Speaker 1: It's like, well, maybe you're not so confident or maybe a someone's forcing those restrictions on you against your will, in which case, OK, you got to do what you got to do.

689
00:39:53,463 --> 00:40:03,880
Speaker 1: But B, if you don't think it's safe enough to hold the convention at the normal capacity with no restrictions, you know, as before, then clearly there is a danger.

690
00:40:04,282 --> 00:40:05,168
Speaker 1: And I'm just not going to.

691
00:40:05,228 --> 00:40:11,920
Speaker 1: I'm going to choose not to go to that convention, which means there's going to be a time period clearly where people are going.

692
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,720
Speaker 1: People who run conventions need money like Otakot is happening.

693
00:40:14,941 --> 00:40:18,600
Speaker 0: It's a mask required, limited capacity, socially distance event.

694
00:40:19,104 --> 00:40:20,238
Speaker 0: That sounds like a nightmare.

695
00:40:21,262 --> 00:40:21,362
Speaker 1: Right.

696
00:40:21,382 --> 00:40:21,543
Speaker 1: Yep.

697
00:40:21,583 --> 00:40:34,280
Speaker 1: So from now for the next month's year, who knows how long there is going to be a period where conventions are happening, but that they have various restrictions that, you know, limit attendance, require masks, do other sorts of things.

698
00:40:35,105 --> 00:40:36,300
Speaker 1: We're not going to those conventions.

699
00:40:36,441 --> 00:40:41,743
Speaker 1: We're going to go to conventions in person again when they are as they were in twenty nineteen.

700
00:40:41,783 --> 00:40:44,680
Speaker 1: Just as many people as the fire marshal allows.

701
00:40:45,164 --> 00:40:46,720
Speaker 1: No masks, no nonsense.

702
00:40:46,921 --> 00:40:49,139
Speaker 1: You just come as normal by a badge and show up.

703
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:49,421
Speaker 1: Yeah.

704
00:40:49,642 --> 00:40:52,040
Speaker 1: Then you'll see us at physical cons again.

705
00:40:52,622 --> 00:40:54,720
Speaker 1: Until then, online cons only.

706
00:40:55,322 --> 00:41:00,365
Speaker 1: If they stop having the online cons in favor of the limited in-person ones, we're just not going to be at cons.

707
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:05,996
Speaker 0: Or maybe we'll do that time to do the thing that I'm not going to actually say out loud because then we might shit talk it.

708
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,507
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

709
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:11,420
Speaker 0: I'm thinking about that thing a lot, but I like it like seriously.

710
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,182
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

711
00:41:12,202 --> 00:41:15,820
Speaker 1: So, you know, this, you know, just letting our policy be known in advance.

712
00:41:15,961 --> 00:41:17,760
Speaker 1: I don't see us changing our minds on this.

713
00:41:18,321 --> 00:41:23,386
Speaker 1: So if you're wondering if we're going to be at a convention or not, just refer to this statement.

714
00:41:23,466 --> 00:41:25,037
Speaker 0: If the convention has a mask policy.

715
00:41:25,701 --> 00:41:31,879
Speaker 1: If you hear an announcement of a convention happening, just look at what they announce and you'll figure out if we're going to be there or not.

716
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:32,261
Speaker 1: Yep.

717
00:41:33,048 --> 00:41:34,260
Speaker 0: Otherwise, check us out on the Internet.

718
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:35,959
Speaker 0: The Book Club book is the tale of Genji.

719
00:41:36,825 --> 00:41:37,800
Speaker 0: I stopped making progress.

720
00:41:38,080 --> 00:41:38,487
Speaker 1: I read a couple more.

721
00:41:38,507 --> 00:41:39,280
Speaker 1: I read a couple more chapters.

722
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,280
Speaker 0: I got to catch up then because I did not read it for the past week because I've been busy.

723
00:41:42,742 --> 00:41:44,380
Speaker 1: I read a really hella long chapter.

724
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:49,500
Speaker 0: I'm confident by the end of July we'll probably do this Book Club book.

725
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,141
Speaker 1: We'll see.

726
00:41:51,182 --> 00:41:56,878
Speaker 1: I still have maybe like I think there were 50 something chapters and I may be around 10, maybe 20 percent.

727
00:41:57,561 --> 00:41:58,510
Speaker 0: I'll hedge.

728
00:41:58,611 --> 00:41:59,500
Speaker 0: August, definitely.

729
00:42:00,782 --> 00:42:01,206
Speaker 1: We'll see.

730
00:42:01,609 --> 00:42:02,900
Speaker 0: We don't make it by August, what the fuck?

731
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,121
Speaker 1: We'll see.

732
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:11,020
Speaker 0: So a thing that we do a lot and I've been doing even more.

733
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:13,020
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously, COVID made this weird.

734
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,759
Speaker 0: We're just not going to talk about COVID times in this.

735
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:22,320
Speaker 0: But in my life, I have stayed in a terrifying number and variety of hotels and motels.

736
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:28,120
Speaker 0: They have been a huge part of my life as a kid growing up, as an adult, in business, going to conventions.

737
00:42:29,041 --> 00:42:31,880
Speaker 0: The kind of work I do means that I do a lot of business traveling.

738
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:35,960
Speaker 0: So I end up staying in a lot of hotels of varying quality all around the world.

739
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:38,040
Speaker 0: And somehow we've never talked about this.

740
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:41,920
Speaker 0: We've always talked about everything else around travel, but not the hotels themselves.

741
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:45,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I mean, hotels are actually really fascinating.

742
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:47,920
Speaker 1: I don't I am not an expert on the history of hotels.

743
00:42:48,302 --> 00:42:55,760
Speaker 1: So if someone is and wants to research it, or maybe I'll research it on my own later, please correct me on everything I'm about to say, because it's probably wrong.

744
00:42:56,621 --> 00:43:04,639
Speaker 1: But the way that I've interpreted the history of hotels is that in the olden times, you'd have the inn, the taverns, like D&D or whatever, right?

745
00:43:05,546 --> 00:43:06,260
Speaker 1: Slayer, right?

746
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:10,760
Speaker 1: You know, because traveling was traveling was very difficult, right?

747
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:19,400
Speaker 1: And so how many people were really in your town who didn't live there, you know, that weren't staying with someone they knew in the town, right?

748
00:43:19,740 --> 00:43:19,821
Speaker 1: Yep.

749
00:43:19,881 --> 00:43:24,647
Speaker 0: You know, in the old days, you'd stop, any traveler would have to stop in a lot of towns along the way.

750
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:26,260
Speaker 1: They had to stop in a lot of towns.

751
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,720
Speaker 1: You know, if you're going really far, you know, you can't make it that far in one day.

752
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,378
Speaker 1: You pretty much just stop every town, right?

753
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:33,680
Speaker 1: You're going to maybe make it one town in one day.

754
00:43:33,761 --> 00:43:34,916
Speaker 1: Who knows how far apart they are?

755
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,559
Speaker 1: You might even have to like camp between towns, right?

756
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:38,202
Speaker 1: Yeah.

757
00:43:38,242 --> 00:43:42,402
Speaker 1: So, you know, they'd just be renting a few rooms above the tavern would be enough for that.

758
00:43:42,684 --> 00:43:45,778
Speaker 0: I know there was a lot of common room stuff where people could.

759
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:52,380
Speaker 0: basically a lot of small towns would have a tavern that would just sort of stay open or a town hall that would just be open to travelers at night.

760
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:55,880
Speaker 1: I'm curious about what hotels were like in a place like Rome, like a big city, right?

761
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,150
Speaker 1: People travel to Rome.

762
00:43:57,250 --> 00:43:58,360
Speaker 1: where, you know, what would they stay in?

763
00:43:59,121 --> 00:44:04,320
Speaker 0: So from what I know, shockingly close to a modern hotel in surprising ways.

764
00:44:05,181 --> 00:44:06,440
Speaker 1: That's unsurprising, actually.

765
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:06,924
Speaker 1: Yeah.

766
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:07,456
Speaker 1: Just, you know.

767
00:44:07,840 --> 00:44:12,840
Speaker 0: Well, because humans are the same humans now that they were then like they had the same ideas and a lot of the same needs.

768
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:24,703
Speaker 1: Now, I know from movies, which obviously movies aren't, you know, nonfiction most of the time, but, you know, they're generally representing the world as it is for the people at the time.

769
00:44:24,884 --> 00:44:32,620
Speaker 1: And I know from watching a lot of movies, especially from the early 20th century and from just common sense, that traveling even then was still difficult.

770
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:33,180
Speaker 1: Right.

771
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:43,538
Speaker 1: You know, the airplanes didn't come about quite so that early, especially not commercial jets, not until a little bit later, you know, mid later 20th century, where they even accessible to a lot of people.

772
00:44:44,341 --> 00:44:47,220
Speaker 1: So, you know, you're going by boats, cars, right?

773
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,519
Speaker 1: So you weren't traveling that far at once.

774
00:44:51,542 --> 00:44:56,759
Speaker 1: And if you did travel somewhere like, let's see, once you get up on a boat, it's like you're staying there a while.

775
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:02,669
Speaker 1: You're not just turning around for a quick trip to London in three days and getting on another boat home.

776
00:45:03,257 --> 00:45:03,460
Speaker 1: Right.

777
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:05,180
Speaker 1: You'll spend, you know, weeks on the boat.

778
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:06,280
Speaker 1: You're spending weeks in Europe.

779
00:45:06,762 --> 00:45:11,200
Speaker 1: So a hotel was a place that someone would be like could be living for quite a while.

780
00:45:11,503 --> 00:45:12,998
Speaker 1: You know, you could be like living there.

781
00:45:14,127 --> 00:45:14,390
Speaker 1: Right.

782
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,280
Speaker 1: And you watch old movies.

783
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:25,707
Speaker 0: A lot of really rich people will just they might have a house somewhere or multiple homes, but they will like a lot of fancy hotels will have floors that a rich person just lives in.

784
00:45:25,727 --> 00:45:26,739
Speaker 0: Yeah.

785
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,340
Speaker 1: People still let people live in hotels.

786
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:29,002
Speaker 1: Absolutely.

787
00:45:29,022 --> 00:45:33,742
Speaker 1: All around the world there, you know, people are in that situation, but for different reasons.

788
00:45:34,526 --> 00:45:42,260
Speaker 1: But yeah, you know, back in the olden days, a hotel was like a place that like a rich person, you know, would live in for quite a period.

789
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:43,081
Speaker 1: Right.

790
00:45:43,965 --> 00:45:47,631
Speaker 1: You know, during while they were traveling and the hotel had all kinds of services.

791
00:45:47,651 --> 00:45:48,039
Speaker 1: Right.

792
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:51,800
Speaker 1: To, you know, cater to this person who is, you know, living there.

793
00:45:51,860 --> 00:45:55,780
Speaker 1: You watch a movie, you know, like Grand Budapest Hotel is like those.

794
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,803
Speaker 1: That was a thing.

795
00:45:56,984 --> 00:45:57,587
Speaker 1: You know, like think

796
00:45:57,627 --> 00:46:11,858
Speaker 0: about the imagine a world before Internet and smartphones and video games and you're traveling and you like stay in some town for a week for some trade convention, got to like be able to receive mail, got to be able to like get calls forwarded to you.

797
00:46:12,282 --> 00:46:15,460
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff you needed to just be like, how are you going to get entertained?

798
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,758
Speaker 0: Just go out every night.

799
00:46:18,041 --> 00:46:20,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you like we were book.

800
00:46:20,614 --> 00:46:21,740
Speaker 1: club book was once Rebecca.

801
00:46:22,001 --> 00:46:22,203
Speaker 1: Right.

802
00:46:22,243 --> 00:46:25,139
Speaker 1: That book begins with them in a hotel that they're living in.

803
00:46:25,321 --> 00:46:25,685
Speaker 1: Yeah.

804
00:46:25,948 --> 00:46:26,759
Speaker 1: That's the whole setup.

805
00:46:27,981 --> 00:46:33,260
Speaker 1: But yet you can see that like the vestiges of that hotel sort of thing.

806
00:46:33,801 --> 00:46:34,122
Speaker 1: Right.

807
00:46:34,182 --> 00:46:41,011
Speaker 1: That that, you know, dynamic of place that a person lives for somewhat, maybe a long period.

808
00:46:41,397 --> 00:46:41,579
Speaker 1: Right.

809
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:47,619
Speaker 1: Represented even in just like a tiny holiday in on the highway somewhere on I-95.

810
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:48,680
Speaker 1: Right.

811
00:46:49,042 --> 00:46:52,094
Speaker 1: You know, there's a concierge who is there to, you know, this.

812
00:46:52,476 --> 00:47:05,357
Speaker 1: the desk can still provide all kinds of services to the people living there, even though they're probably there for one night and then they're on their way, you know, like laundry and, you know, oh, you don't have a toothbrush or just all kinds of things like.

813
00:47:05,377 --> 00:47:09,093
Speaker 1: they're providing all these services to you because they're.

814
00:47:09,193 --> 00:47:10,880
Speaker 1: it's the same hospitality business.

815
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,520
Speaker 1: There's a restaurant, there's room service.

816
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,569
Speaker 1: They can bring food to you.

817
00:47:13,629 --> 00:47:14,879
Speaker 1: Just add you push a button.

818
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:27,150
Speaker 0: Of course, a lot of this got changed, especially in America, by the sort of destruction of the middle class, the same reason why there's cheap, crappy plane tickets and far too expensive, ludicrous plane tickets and nothing in between.

819
00:47:27,733 --> 00:47:36,020
Speaker 0: hotels went the same route in that most people would stay in whatever hotel was cheapest and didn't care at all about the accommodations or the amenities.

820
00:47:36,261 --> 00:47:51,440
Speaker 0: And especially with the advent of smartphones and tablets and wireless Internet, suddenly one of the primary revenue sources of hotels in America selling people pay per view and movies and pornography disappeared overnight.

821
00:47:51,840 --> 00:47:52,615
Speaker 0: Everyone just had their own.

822
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:54,526
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

823
00:47:54,546 --> 00:47:57,299
Speaker 1: You know, they have Wi-Fi, but you can't be getting away selling the Wi-Fi.

824
00:47:57,580 --> 00:48:04,842
Speaker 0: They tried to sell the Wi-Fi, but it's like, no, it has to be selling the Wi-Fi works for a brief period where people didn't have high bandwidth on their smartphones and tethering yet.

825
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:06,300
Speaker 1: Yep, that's true.

826
00:48:07,102 --> 00:48:09,937
Speaker 0: I paid for Wi-Fi many times out of desperation in the old days.

827
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:17,004
Speaker 0: I remember PAX West 2008, the hotel we stayed in gave us free Wi-Fi and that was kind of a big deal.

828
00:48:18,115 --> 00:48:18,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's true.

829
00:48:19,841 --> 00:48:21,339
Speaker 0: Now, you know, that was the biggest deal.

830
00:48:22,301 --> 00:48:22,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

831
00:48:23,995 --> 00:48:24,680
Speaker 1: After that, right.

832
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,080
Speaker 1: Once cars became a thing, you had the motel.

833
00:48:27,441 --> 00:48:31,520
Speaker 0: I've stayed until I spent way more time in motels than hotels.

834
00:48:31,621 --> 00:48:35,282
Speaker 0: And also I had a weird interest in the history of motels, so I kind of know a lot about it.

835
00:48:36,116 --> 00:48:36,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

836
00:48:36,721 --> 00:48:47,378
Speaker 1: And then I think the final major category, there's plenty of other categories at the hostel, the hostel, the serviced apartment is something I've appreciated more as I get older, and the Airbnb.

837
00:48:48,722 --> 00:48:50,079
Speaker 1: Yes, the Airbnb is a new one.

838
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:52,997
Speaker 1: And then to the bed and breakfast, I think would be the final category.

839
00:48:53,760 --> 00:48:57,941
Speaker 0: Bed and breakfast always seem fun, but I rarely have the reason or time to do that kind of thing.

840
00:48:57,961 --> 00:49:06,980
Speaker 1: I always feel like the bed and breakfast is the thing you do because you're visiting a place that isn't really like a tourist destination, right?

841
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:09,120
Speaker 1: It's like they don't have a hotel or a motel there.

842
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:10,620
Speaker 1: No one's going on vacation there.

843
00:49:10,921 --> 00:49:11,788
Speaker 1: It's not a city.

844
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:13,440
Speaker 1: The population isn't high.

845
00:49:14,745 --> 00:49:18,280
Speaker 1: But you don't know anyone there because it's like a wildernessy place, maybe.

846
00:49:18,780 --> 00:49:21,540
Speaker 1: And someone runs a bed and breakfast because they have an extra room.

847
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:23,248
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's like where I've stayed at.

848
00:49:23,268 --> 00:49:30,819
Speaker 0: that kind of place is like if you're going somewhere for the primary purpose of outdoor sporting, like wilderness hiking, and that's just the place you're staying for a few days.

849
00:49:31,581 --> 00:49:41,783
Speaker 0: Or if there's an event like a wedding at a small town out somewhere and you need like that's basically where you stay for a couple extra days just to have a retreat around that event.

850
00:49:42,166 --> 00:49:43,778
Speaker 0: But other than the event, you don't know anyone there.

851
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,041
Speaker 1: Yeah.

852
00:49:45,061 --> 00:49:53,819
Speaker 1: So I mean, I think when I think about bed and breakfast lately, you know, I think about, you know, Millerton, New York, where we go on the Harlem Valley Rail Ride, which will hopefully return.

853
00:49:54,602 --> 00:49:56,280
Speaker 1: We'll see, you know, the restrictions are gone.

854
00:49:56,783 --> 00:49:58,539
Speaker 1: They said restrictions are gone by July 1st.

855
00:49:58,800 --> 00:49:59,359
Speaker 1: They would have it.

856
00:49:59,540 --> 00:50:03,579
Speaker 0: Talk about an outdoor event that has a lot of fresh air around you.

857
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:04,722
Speaker 1: Sure enough.

858
00:50:04,803 --> 00:50:07,860
Speaker 1: But that's a town that, you know, it has some people, right?

859
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:09,560
Speaker 1: There's reasons to go to that town.

860
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:14,683
Speaker 1: Some people have reasons to go to that town, but I don't think they have a hotel in the town.

861
00:50:14,724 --> 00:50:16,000
Speaker 1: I think it's going to be a little far away.

862
00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:16,321
Speaker 1: Right.

863
00:50:16,544 --> 00:50:17,920
Speaker 1: I've never seen one on the Main Street.

864
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,221
Speaker 0: Yeah.

865
00:50:18,261 --> 00:50:20,309
Speaker 0: People seem to drive from far away.

866
00:50:20,329 --> 00:50:23,491
Speaker 0: or do we do have a camp in that baseball field the night before?

867
00:50:23,512 --> 00:50:23,858
Speaker 0: Yeah.

868
00:50:23,980 --> 00:50:24,777
Speaker 1: I haven't seen a motel.

869
00:50:25,060 --> 00:50:26,340
Speaker 1: We camp on the baseball field.

870
00:50:26,461 --> 00:50:31,240
Speaker 1: But I think if you're going to stay like on that Main Street, there must be a bed and breakfast near there somewhere.

871
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,568
Speaker 0: There's got to be.

872
00:50:32,628 --> 00:50:33,940
Speaker 1: I feel like there has to be one.

873
00:50:34,320 --> 00:50:34,541
Speaker 0: Yeah.

874
00:50:34,602 --> 00:50:45,460
Speaker 0: There's also a big industry, especially in the New York area, that does not apply to a lot of places where a lot of people like to head upstate and go to a bed and breakfast for a weekend to do a little retreat and just be out of the city.

875
00:50:46,361 --> 00:50:51,905
Speaker 1: There are, I think, I have seen some bed and breakfast that like cater to a specific interest.

876
00:50:52,688 --> 00:50:56,885
Speaker 0: You know, like there's one in Beacon that's like birdwatcher focus, like you're a birdwatcher.

877
00:50:56,926 --> 00:50:59,340
Speaker 0: You come upstate, you can stay in this bed and breakfast.

878
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:00,940
Speaker 0: It's not in Beacon, it's like right near Beacon.

879
00:51:01,360 --> 00:51:05,963
Speaker 0: And this bed and breakfast has like bird, like the only people staying there will be birders, probably.

880
00:51:06,284 --> 00:51:12,100
Speaker 0: And there's oh, man, I've never seen a bed and breakfast like the gamer gamer's bed and breakfast.

881
00:51:12,782 --> 00:51:15,454
Speaker 1: I was about to say my job might probably already.

882
00:51:15,776 --> 00:51:16,720
Speaker 1: it probably already exists.

883
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:20,060
Speaker 1: If it's probably a D&D, there's probably a D&D bread and breakfast out there.

884
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:20,644
Speaker 0: He's got it.

885
00:51:20,664 --> 00:51:22,160
Speaker 0: He's got to call it the table toppers in.

886
00:51:22,260 --> 00:51:24,680
Speaker 0: You put it within an hour of New York City, upstate somewhere.

887
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:26,778
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's do it.

888
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:27,262
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

889
00:51:28,209 --> 00:51:29,840
Speaker 0: OK, kind of really want to talk anyway.

890
00:51:30,221 --> 00:51:41,047
Speaker 0: So motels, until it's interesting, because, you know, we were not a wealthy family growing up, so we rarely stayed in hotels like when I was a kid, like we were not in hotels often.

891
00:51:41,471 --> 00:51:42,380
Speaker 0: We would be in hotels.

892
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,979
Speaker 1: The only time we went to hotels like specific fancy vacations, like a once a year thing, like a Disney World, maybe.

893
00:51:49,220 --> 00:52:01,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, like a Cedar Point, even when like when we went to other vacation spots that weren't Disney World, we were usually in like service department that had kitchen kind of place or motel on the road.

894
00:52:01,940 --> 00:52:07,429
Speaker 1: Or, you know, even if it was like technically a hotel, like a quality in or something on the road, it's like that's not.

895
00:52:07,510 --> 00:52:08,900
Speaker 1: you know, that might as well be a motel.

896
00:52:09,021 --> 00:52:09,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's it's.

897
00:52:09,910 --> 00:52:10,739
Speaker 1: it's on an I-95 exit.

898
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:19,219
Speaker 0: Like in the old days, there was a much more distinct line, like motels were characterized by such things as you park outside the door to your room.

899
00:52:19,622 --> 00:52:23,120
Speaker 0: There aren't common areas generally, there aren't hallways.

900
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:30,520
Speaker 1: Your architecture of a motel is distinct, even if there are currently hotels that serve the same purpose that motels used to sell.

901
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:38,640
Speaker 0: Like you're you roll in usually on a road trip, you spend the night, you get up early, you get the fuck out of town as a place to sleep and nothing else.

902
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:43,700
Speaker 0: Maybe you stay there a day to do local attractions and then you continue there.

903
00:52:44,081 --> 00:52:57,120
Speaker 0: There are very American phenomenon like they exist in other places, but like they really what most people think of as a motel arose in the late 20s and then especially like kind of had a renaissance and exploded in the 50s in America.

904
00:52:57,982 --> 00:52:59,859
Speaker 1: They're still around, there's still plenty of them.

905
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:02,397
Speaker 1: A lot of them are the same motels from the 50s.

906
00:53:03,620 --> 00:53:09,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's because, you know, in America you have this sort of, you know, not only the driving, other places clearly have cars, right?

907
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:13,140
Speaker 1: But the long distance driving in America.

908
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:20,680
Speaker 0: Oh, all are a lot of our vacations as kids, if they weren't like just go to Cedar Point and stay at the hotel breakers, which is actually a moderately fancy hotel.

909
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:25,204
Speaker 0: I'm so I to this day, I'm surprised my parents could afford that vacation every year in retrospect.

910
00:53:25,626 --> 00:53:28,099
Speaker 0: But because I love I'm thinking about going there post-Covid.

911
00:53:28,481 --> 00:53:29,411
Speaker 0: That shit ain't cheap.

912
00:53:29,633 --> 00:53:30,240
Speaker 0: Good God.

913
00:53:30,361 --> 00:53:31,497
Speaker 0: That is an expensive hotel.

914
00:53:32,121 --> 00:53:33,152
Speaker 1: Anyway, we were in Australia.

915
00:53:33,193 --> 00:53:33,880
Speaker 1: We were in Australia.

916
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,262
Speaker 1: We did.

917
00:53:34,302 --> 00:53:36,980
Speaker 1: There was basically a motel we stayed at near the Penguin Place.

918
00:53:37,140 --> 00:53:37,784
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

919
00:53:37,825 --> 00:53:40,360
Speaker 0: That motel was like made out of cinder blocks, basically.

920
00:53:41,365 --> 00:53:42,420
Speaker 1: But that was clearly a motel.

921
00:53:42,583 --> 00:53:43,339
Speaker 1: It wasn't the hotel.

922
00:53:43,620 --> 00:53:43,741
Speaker 1: Yep.

923
00:53:44,263 --> 00:53:47,620
Speaker 1: But generally what I'd say is we actually hit all three in Australia.

924
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:48,685
Speaker 1: We started in hotel.

925
00:53:49,066 --> 00:53:52,040
Speaker 1: We went to motel and we came back to service department.

926
00:53:52,140 --> 00:54:02,619
Speaker 0: We also did something I'd never done in my life until that trip was get to a town without a pre-booked hotel and just like wander into a random hotel, go to the front desk and be like, hey, got any rooms today?

927
00:54:03,140 --> 00:54:06,640
Speaker 1: And it's funny because I knew it was well, I think we called them on our way there.

928
00:54:06,801 --> 00:54:07,918
Speaker 0: We called one on the way there.

929
00:54:08,342 --> 00:54:08,908
Speaker 0: They were booked up.

930
00:54:09,211 --> 00:54:09,980
Speaker 0: Then we called another one.

931
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:10,508
Speaker 0: They were booked up.

932
00:54:10,528 --> 00:54:11,159
Speaker 0: We're like, all right.

933
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:13,940
Speaker 0: Then we got to town and every hotel was booked up.

934
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:15,240
Speaker 0: We told that story on Geek Nights.

935
00:54:18,163 --> 00:54:25,189
Speaker 0: But the way I'd characterize the difference today is that hotels have amenities and motels don't like that's kind of hotels have.

936
00:54:25,511 --> 00:54:28,723
Speaker 0: motels have some they have a different set of amenities.

937
00:54:28,763 --> 00:54:37,000
Speaker 0: They'll have like this bare minimum set of amenities, like a motel will have an ice machine somewhere you can refill your cooler with.

938
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:38,460
Speaker 1: Yes, it usually will.

939
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:38,760
Speaker 1: Yes.

940
00:54:39,905 --> 00:54:53,062
Speaker 0: But I spent most of my childhood going to motels because we a lot of our vacations were road trip to somewhere like we're driving to Florida or we're driving to Alabama, like let's go stop in a motel every night along the way, do the local shit and then move on.

941
00:54:54,707 --> 00:55:05,262
Speaker 0: But when I became an adult, I started saying mostly in hotels because most of the travel I do is either vacation, work, travel or Scott and I are going to a convention.

942
00:55:06,025 --> 00:55:12,000
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's most of the travel is we're going we're in a city already and we're going to a different city.

943
00:55:12,341 --> 00:55:16,860
Speaker 1: It's like there is and we get to the other city with a plane or a bus.

944
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:17,102
Speaker 1: Right.

945
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:18,880
Speaker 1: We're not stopping along the way.

946
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:20,754
Speaker 1: We someone else is transporting us.

947
00:55:20,835 --> 00:55:21,460
Speaker 0: when I'm on my way.

948
00:55:21,580 --> 00:55:26,404
Speaker 0: When I was on my way to Otacon, my goal was to get to Otacon as fast as possible to do Otacon.

949
00:55:26,445 --> 00:55:27,858
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit about what's in the way.

950
00:55:29,081 --> 00:55:32,660
Speaker 1: It's like even going to Australia, like the farthest I can possibly go.

951
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:36,760
Speaker 1: It's like, well, I take a train to an airport or a bus to an airport or whatever.

952
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:38,070
Speaker 1: I get on a plane.

953
00:55:38,091 --> 00:55:39,220
Speaker 1: It takes me all the way to California.

954
00:55:39,361 --> 00:55:40,065
Speaker 1: Another plane takes.

955
00:55:40,085 --> 00:55:43,161
Speaker 0: the plane was arguably a motel because I slept on it a couple of times.

956
00:55:43,483 --> 00:55:46,100
Speaker 1: Arguably, the plane is the motel provides all kinds of services.

957
00:55:46,261 --> 00:55:46,421
Speaker 1: Right.

958
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:50,440
Speaker 1: And it's like get off the plane and then a car takes me to the city.

959
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:51,926
Speaker 1: It's like I'm all right.

960
00:55:51,946 --> 00:55:52,308
Speaker 1: There is no.

961
00:55:52,529 --> 00:55:54,900
Speaker 1: there's no point at which I need any motel biz.

962
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:56,920
Speaker 1: It's like I'm in city and then I'm in city.

963
00:55:57,181 --> 00:56:03,424
Speaker 1: So, you know, there isn't that sort of road trip thing going on required, you know, since the 90s, I guess.

964
00:56:03,725 --> 00:56:08,189
Speaker 0: So I guess I want to make a clear separation in our conversation between the business travel.

965
00:56:08,229 --> 00:56:09,439
Speaker 0: I'll talk about that at the end, because that's.

966
00:56:09,640 --> 00:56:10,184
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot the.

967
00:56:10,265 --> 00:56:12,300
Speaker 1: I forgot the sort of like resort hotel.

968
00:56:13,362 --> 00:56:16,200
Speaker 0: Oh, I kind of just lumped that into hotel in my brain.

969
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:17,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's a little.

970
00:56:17,069 --> 00:56:17,960
Speaker 1: there's a little bit different.

971
00:56:18,060 --> 00:56:20,680
Speaker 1: I'll talk about that, because I was in one somewhat recent.

972
00:56:20,840 --> 00:56:21,162
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

973
00:56:21,203 --> 00:56:21,364
Speaker 0: Yeah.

974
00:56:21,404 --> 00:56:23,480
Speaker 0: That trip you guys did because I went to a tropical.

975
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:23,701
Speaker 1: Yeah.

976
00:56:23,721 --> 00:56:27,346
Speaker 1: I just went to a tropical island because I was like, I want to go way back when I went to Costa Rica.

977
00:56:27,366 --> 00:56:34,041
Speaker 0: We stayed in one of those places for several days before we went up to do the like the real trip or actually did stuff other than just stay at a resort.

978
00:56:35,044 --> 00:56:49,040
Speaker 0: But yeah, so most of the hotels that Scott and I stay in these days are literally we are at a convention and we just need a hotel, not a motel, has to be a hotel that is as close to the convention as possible.

979
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:56,860
Speaker 0: That's pretty much my only requirement is as close to the convention as possible and is not horrifying, but horrifying.

980
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,920
Speaker 1: Almost none of them are and not just ridiculously expensive.

981
00:57:01,621 --> 00:57:05,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, like even a run of the mill Marriott is like, OK, fine, whatever.

982
00:57:05,620 --> 00:57:13,182
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like, I don't want to pay like if there's a hotel that's closer to the convention, but it's five hundred bucks a night now, I'll stay a few blocks away in that.

983
00:57:13,202 --> 00:57:14,379
Speaker 1: You're not going to stay at the Four Seasons.

984
00:57:15,344 --> 00:57:16,860
Speaker 0: No, I need like two and a packs.

985
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:17,826
Speaker 1: Someone else's money.

986
00:57:17,886 --> 00:57:19,379
Speaker 0: I need like two and a half seasons tops.

987
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:22,555
Speaker 1: Two and a half seasons.

988
00:57:22,736 --> 00:57:23,260
Speaker 0: You know, it's funny.

989
00:57:23,921 --> 00:57:32,460
Speaker 0: I didn't quite recognize the material differences between a three star, four star and five star hotel until I started doing business travel.

990
00:57:32,521 --> 00:57:33,520
Speaker 0: Like that's something I ignored.

991
00:57:34,026 --> 00:57:35,100
Speaker 0: But they're kind of specific.

992
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:36,499
Speaker 0: The differences I've realized.

993
00:57:37,161 --> 00:57:37,322
Speaker 1: Yeah.

994
00:57:37,382 --> 00:57:45,840
Speaker 1: So the one time I experienced I guess the first time I experienced the five star hotel, I was the first job I had after college.

995
00:57:46,001 --> 00:57:46,262
Speaker 1: Right.

996
00:57:46,785 --> 00:57:47,690
Speaker 1: There was this weird.

997
00:57:48,555 --> 00:57:49,340
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was.

998
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,639
Speaker 1: I don't remember what it was for.

999
00:57:51,041 --> 00:57:59,900
Speaker 1: But basically my boss's boss was having a staycation in the Mandarin Oriental in Manhattan, even though the dude lived in Connecticut and worked in Manhattan.

1000
00:58:01,620 --> 00:58:06,138
Speaker 1: And they had decided there was going to be some sort of like, you know, it was our.

1001
00:58:06,500 --> 00:58:07,840
Speaker 1: our team was very small.

1002
00:58:07,941 --> 00:58:10,080
Speaker 1: It was like five, six people.

1003
00:58:10,321 --> 00:58:10,582
Speaker 1: Right.

1004
00:58:11,125 --> 00:58:19,160
Speaker 1: But they had decided for some reason, I forget that it was going to be like a little party get together in the bar restaurant area of the hotel.

1005
00:58:19,882 --> 00:58:21,258
Speaker 1: So I had to go there.

1006
00:58:21,741 --> 00:58:34,708
Speaker 1: So and when I went there, all I really remember about going there is that usually, you know, when someone's trying to be hospitable, right, like extra hospitable, like, oh, good sir.

1007
00:58:34,892 --> 00:58:35,339
Speaker 1: Is that right?

1008
00:58:35,821 --> 00:58:41,080
Speaker 1: It can usually come off as like, you know, corny, trying too hard.

1009
00:58:41,662 --> 00:58:45,364
Speaker 1: You know, it's like it's like when you go into a retail store and it makes me uncomfortable.

1010
00:58:45,747 --> 00:58:47,860
Speaker 0: And I think they're also uncomfortable.

1011
00:58:48,542 --> 00:58:48,803
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1012
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:51,440
Speaker 1: Like you go into a retail store and someone's like, oh, can I help you?

1013
00:58:51,582 --> 00:58:52,940
Speaker 1: Like that sort of feeling, right?

1014
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:54,879
Speaker 1: Like they're trying to cater to you.

1015
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:58,280
Speaker 0: Someone told you to say those words to me and you'll get fired if you don't say them.

1016
00:58:58,422 --> 00:58:59,398
Speaker 0: I don't want you to help me.

1017
00:58:59,841 --> 00:59:02,340
Speaker 0: I'm going to give you an out because I also do not want your help.

1018
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:02,886
Speaker 0: I'm fine.

1019
00:59:03,211 --> 00:59:03,860
Speaker 0: It's a hardware store.

1020
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:04,751
Speaker 0: I'm looking at hammers.

1021
00:59:04,771 --> 00:59:05,259
Speaker 0: They're right there.

1022
00:59:05,981 --> 00:59:11,288
Speaker 1: And all I remember is that at the when I went to the five star hotel, right, just for dinner.

1023
00:59:11,716 --> 00:59:11,920
Speaker 1: Right.

1024
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,699
Speaker 1: The they were still doing that.

1025
00:59:14,980 --> 00:59:16,400
Speaker 1: You know, what were they doing?

1026
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:17,580
Speaker 1: Same hospitable stuff.

1027
00:59:17,681 --> 00:59:18,674
Speaker 1: How can I help you, sir?

1028
00:59:18,857 --> 00:59:19,059
Speaker 1: Right.

1029
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:25,942
Speaker 1: But the manner in which they did it right, whatever hospitality they get in, it's slippery.

1030
00:59:26,023 --> 00:59:30,019
Speaker 0: I'm the kind of person where, like someone tries to take my bags like a bell hop and I'm like, fuck you.

1031
00:59:30,120 --> 00:59:31,140
Speaker 0: Don't stay away from my bags.

1032
00:59:31,241 --> 00:59:31,748
Speaker 0: I don't know you.

1033
00:59:31,789 --> 00:59:32,418
Speaker 0: That's my purse.

1034
00:59:33,020 --> 00:59:35,639
Speaker 1: Whatever hospitality training that they had.

1035
00:59:35,941 --> 00:59:36,242
Speaker 1: Right.

1036
00:59:36,724 --> 00:59:40,980
Speaker 1: Is somehow they have some something psychological about it.

1037
00:59:41,100 --> 00:59:44,760
Speaker 1: Someone must somebody out there must be an expert on this hospitality science.

1038
00:59:44,981 --> 00:59:45,183
Speaker 1: Right.

1039
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:47,598
Speaker 1: Where they're able to, you know.

1040
00:59:48,405 --> 00:59:49,719
Speaker 1: Oh, good, sir, can I help you?

1041
00:59:50,060 --> 01:00:00,971
Speaker 1: Right, like offer you services, cater to you, try to rub your feet and, you know, kiss your ass and everything without making you feel like it's out of place or awkward or unwanted.

1042
01:00:00,991 --> 01:00:01,093
Speaker 1: Right.

1043
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,039
Speaker 1: It's just like it's like magic.

1044
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:04,586
Speaker 1: It's too nice.

1045
01:00:04,667 --> 01:00:06,880
Speaker 1: It's like no one deserves to be treated this nicely.

1046
01:00:07,202 --> 01:00:10,300
Speaker 1: And you're not feeling uncomfortable because it's, you know, intrusive.

1047
01:00:10,681 --> 01:00:13,660
Speaker 1: You're feeling uncomfortable because no one deserves this level.

1048
01:00:14,203 --> 01:00:16,240
Speaker 1: No human should be doing this to any other human.

1049
01:00:16,623 --> 01:00:16,845
Speaker 1: Right.

1050
01:00:16,905 --> 01:00:18,500
Speaker 1: Providing this level of niceness.

1051
01:00:18,943 --> 01:00:19,718
Speaker 1: This is too nice.

1052
01:00:21,162 --> 01:00:25,520
Speaker 1: And that's why it cost five hundred dollars at least, you know.

1053
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:32,019
Speaker 0: I think the best like the best hotel because business travel is this whole different ballgame, especially with the industry I'm in.

1054
01:00:32,963 --> 01:00:36,280
Speaker 0: So I pretty much put up in five star hotels all the time.

1055
01:00:36,901 --> 01:00:41,880
Speaker 0: The best one I've ever stayed in like that type of travel was this Marriott in Singapore.

1056
01:00:42,285 --> 01:00:43,180
Speaker 0: That's kind of downtown.

1057
01:00:43,742 --> 01:00:45,839
Speaker 0: That's the one where there was the Pinkie Pie Lambo.

1058
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:51,679
Speaker 0: The Lamborghini painted to look like Pinkie Pie with a big Pinkie Pie on one side and Rainbow Dash on the other side.

1059
01:00:52,221 --> 01:01:04,779
Speaker 0: And it was the fanciest car parked at that hotel, because, you know, fancy hotels will do a thing where the richest person's car that happens to be there will usually be put out front to kind of show off like that person gets to show off their car.

1060
01:01:05,402 --> 01:01:07,218
Speaker 0: That was the car that was parked in front of this J.W.

1061
01:01:07,620 --> 01:01:08,242
Speaker 0: Mary out there.

1062
01:01:08,864 --> 01:01:13,481
Speaker 0: But I could literally not afford to stay in this hotel in my normal life.

1063
01:01:13,522 --> 01:01:16,700
Speaker 0: I could only stay here if someone else paid for me to stay there.

1064
01:01:17,301 --> 01:01:23,359
Speaker 0: The level of like amenities and service and that, just like you described, it's like oily and it gets in under your skin.

1065
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:26,560
Speaker 0: Next thing you know, they're doing all these things for you without you even asking.

1066
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:27,363
Speaker 0: You don't even notice.

1067
01:01:27,403 --> 01:01:31,607
Speaker 0: Like I get up, I left my suit to be pressed because I had meetings the next day.

1068
01:01:31,628 --> 01:01:32,460
Speaker 0: I walked.

1069
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:33,531
Speaker 0: I don't have my suit on.

1070
01:01:33,592 --> 01:01:34,280
Speaker 0: I just had my shirt on.

1071
01:01:34,380 --> 01:01:35,083
Speaker 0: I walked downstairs.

1072
01:01:35,384 --> 01:01:36,168
Speaker 0: I go to the breakfast.

1073
01:01:36,308 --> 01:01:43,019
Speaker 0: that's free and someone just comes to my table without asking and just puts my suit next to me.

1074
01:01:43,424 --> 01:01:44,159
Speaker 0: On a little hanger.

1075
01:01:45,500 --> 01:01:48,460
Speaker 0: Ready, pressed and ready for me to put on to go about my day.

1076
01:01:48,900 --> 01:01:52,020
Speaker 0: And in the pocket of that suit, there was one little candy in the pocket.

1077
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:54,240
Speaker 0: It's ridiculous.

1078
01:01:55,180 --> 01:02:01,260
Speaker 0: But yeah, when I'm not doing business travel, I that is not worth that money like ever.

1079
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:06,881
Speaker 1: No, when I like even if I was mega rich, I would I wouldn't keep enough money to do that.

1080
01:02:06,942 --> 01:02:10,280
Speaker 1: But also, yeah, I wouldn't spend the money on that.

1081
01:02:10,320 --> 01:02:14,641
Speaker 1: But the difference is when I'm basically should that those hotels basically shouldn't exist.

1082
01:02:15,925 --> 01:02:23,940
Speaker 0: The big difference is a business traveler is like there to do work all day and is like ostensibly needs to be efficient.

1083
01:02:24,482 --> 01:02:28,100
Speaker 0: And the idea is like I don't have time to think about how do I get my laundry done?

1084
01:02:28,300 --> 01:02:32,040
Speaker 0: Like I got to work like nine to six every day while I'm in this town.

1085
01:02:32,220 --> 01:02:33,043
Speaker 0: I don't have free time.

1086
01:02:33,505 --> 01:02:37,484
Speaker 0: So the hotel amenities are like I need an office to go do work in.

1087
01:02:37,524 --> 01:02:38,380
Speaker 0: I need to print shit out.

1088
01:02:38,561 --> 01:02:41,260
Speaker 0: I need to like rent a conference room, like have a meeting.

1089
01:02:42,240 --> 01:02:45,382
Speaker 0: My laundry just got to be done because I'm flying out in a couple of days to go somewhere else.

1090
01:02:45,885 --> 01:02:49,039
Speaker 0: But when I go to a convention, I don't need shit.

1091
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:50,065
Speaker 0: I don't need anything.

1092
01:02:50,085 --> 01:02:51,699
Speaker 0: The hotel is a bed to sleep in.

1093
01:02:52,380 --> 01:02:54,518
Speaker 0: Maybe it's a place to play a role playing game.

1094
01:02:56,041 --> 01:03:09,180
Speaker 0: Like the only thing I really need out of a hotel when I travel with Scott and Emily and we do our noble stuff is a bed to sleep in and hopefully a bathroom, a bathroom and a lobby that is suitable to play games and get some snacks at night and maybe.

1095
01:03:10,181 --> 01:03:10,964
Speaker 1: Yep, pretty much.

1096
01:03:11,305 --> 01:03:16,240
Speaker 0: I do find common spaces a lot in hotels at conventions, but not in non conventions.

1097
01:03:17,283 --> 01:03:17,424
Speaker 1: No.

1098
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:19,680
Speaker 1: So the final was the resort hotel.

1099
01:03:19,841 --> 01:03:20,001
Speaker 1: Right.

1100
01:03:20,021 --> 01:03:26,840
Speaker 1: So the resort hotel, what's special, what sets it apart, I think is services wise, usually not too different from regular hotel.

1101
01:03:27,061 --> 01:03:27,322
Speaker 1: Right.

1102
01:03:27,784 --> 01:03:32,060
Speaker 1: Is that it's joined at the hip with some sort of destination.

1103
01:03:32,404 --> 01:03:32,565
Speaker 1: Right.

1104
01:03:32,585 --> 01:03:33,960
Speaker 1: Like a Disney World hotel.

1105
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:35,800
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about the ones just in Orlando.

1106
01:03:35,900 --> 01:03:37,920
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the ones that are at Disney World.

1107
01:03:38,241 --> 01:03:38,542
Speaker 1: Right.

1108
01:03:38,964 --> 01:03:43,200
Speaker 1: It's like it's part of the hotel becomes part of your destination.

1109
01:03:43,421 --> 01:03:44,200
Speaker 0: It's not just a place.

1110
01:03:44,440 --> 01:03:47,923
Speaker 0: I've been to Disney World as a kid where you stay outside and like drive in or take a shuttle in every day.

1111
01:03:47,963 --> 01:03:52,179
Speaker 0: But when you're in the resort itself, it's like the outside world doesn't exist.

1112
01:03:52,580 --> 01:03:52,962
Speaker 1: It's right.

1113
01:03:53,063 --> 01:03:55,680
Speaker 1: Or like the beach, you know, the beach resort hotel.

1114
01:03:56,022 --> 01:03:59,220
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, you are coming to Tropical Island.

1115
01:03:59,701 --> 01:04:00,024
Speaker 1: Right.

1116
01:04:00,105 --> 01:04:01,760
Speaker 1: And it's like the Tropical Island has many beaches.

1117
01:04:02,102 --> 01:04:04,740
Speaker 1: But this part of the beach belongs to that hotel.

1118
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:06,680
Speaker 1: You are going to that hotel's beach.

1119
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:11,520
Speaker 1: Not only is the hotel the place you are staying, it's also the beach you are enjoying.

1120
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:11,841
Speaker 1: Right.

1121
01:04:11,861 --> 01:04:14,740
Speaker 1: You are going to enjoy the thing the hotel has.

1122
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:21,300
Speaker 1: It is both your reason for being there and the place that you are staying while you are there at the same time.

1123
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:28,380
Speaker 0: Like for me, it was the hotel breakers, which was the resort hotel that Cedar Point was built next to later.

1124
01:04:29,401 --> 01:04:33,540
Speaker 0: So it is like the hotel is basically inside the park and has its own private beach.

1125
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:37,880
Speaker 0: Like it's it's heavily integrated with the experience of I'm going to Cedar Point.

1126
01:04:39,381 --> 01:04:39,602
Speaker 1: Yep.

1127
01:04:39,622 --> 01:04:43,140
Speaker 1: So it's like we would go to the, I was on the Tropical Island, we went to the hotel.

1128
01:04:43,360 --> 01:04:45,160
Speaker 0: Apparently, John Philip Sousa would frequent that hotel.

1129
01:04:45,320 --> 01:04:46,078
Speaker 0: I didn't realize that.

1130
01:04:46,941 --> 01:04:47,343
Speaker 1: OK.

1131
01:04:47,786 --> 01:04:50,120
Speaker 1: And then we, you know, we'd wake up in the morning.

1132
01:04:50,381 --> 01:04:50,642
Speaker 1: Right.

1133
01:04:50,843 --> 01:05:00,080
Speaker 1: And we would go outside and just, you know, the hotel, we would go right to the beach that was part of the hotel and sit in the beach chairs that were owned by the hotel and swim in the water.

1134
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:03,199
Speaker 1: The only other people in the water in that area were hotel guests.

1135
01:05:03,620 --> 01:05:09,849
Speaker 0: But those experiences, like it's different from the the rich person business travel I described where the amenities are focused around.

1136
01:05:09,889 --> 01:05:19,420
Speaker 0: like these tasks, the amenities at these resort hotels are more like make you forget the outside world exists and like don't bother you with the details.

1137
01:05:19,640 --> 01:05:26,380
Speaker 0: So like you'll be on the beach and some places you can like wave and a person will just walk over and you'd be like, yeah, could I get some orange juice?

1138
01:05:27,040 --> 01:05:27,779
Speaker 1: And they could have done that.

1139
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:28,507
Speaker 1: We could have done that.

1140
01:05:28,527 --> 01:05:29,780
Speaker 1: It was a bar on the beach.

1141
01:05:29,840 --> 01:05:31,139
Speaker 0: They'll just come back with some orange juice.

1142
01:05:31,484 --> 01:05:32,780
Speaker 0: They won't charge you any money.

1143
01:05:32,922 --> 01:05:33,838
Speaker 0: They know who you are.

1144
01:05:34,141 --> 01:05:35,079
Speaker 0: They'll just add it to your bill.

1145
01:05:36,721 --> 01:05:36,901
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1146
01:05:37,082 --> 01:05:47,100
Speaker 1: Also, the usually the resort hotels, if they do not have something directly as part of themselves, they are heavily integrated with the tourism industry in the area.

1147
01:05:47,260 --> 01:05:49,700
Speaker 1: So, for example, we went snorkeling one day.

1148
01:05:49,841 --> 01:05:50,084
Speaker 1: Right.

1149
01:05:50,367 --> 01:05:51,500
Speaker 1: How did we go snorkeling?

1150
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:58,460
Speaker 1: Well, when I arrived at the hotel, after we dumped our stuff in the room, I went to the concierge and I was like, I want to look at the list of stuff to do.

1151
01:05:58,581 --> 01:06:00,159
Speaker 1: And I was like, I want to do that, that and that.

1152
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,369
Speaker 1: And they're like, OK, come back to the.

1153
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:05,208
Speaker 1: you know, I didn't have to call the snorkeling place.

1154
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:05,615
Speaker 1: Right.

1155
01:06:06,221 --> 01:06:09,862
Speaker 1: I didn't have to all I didn't have to pay, give them a credit, you know, any kind of thing.

1156
01:06:10,164 --> 01:06:12,520
Speaker 1: I just said, those are the things you want to do on these days.

1157
01:06:12,942 --> 01:06:15,420
Speaker 1: And I just wrote down so I wouldn't forget which days it was.

1158
01:06:15,841 --> 01:06:20,040
Speaker 1: And then on like some day, I guess Thursday, I'm just going to say random day.

1159
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,311
Speaker 1: 8 a.m.

1160
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:22,000
Speaker 1: or whatever.

1161
01:06:22,220 --> 01:06:23,218
Speaker 1: I walked out of our room.

1162
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:28,520
Speaker 1: I went to the front of the hotel and the bus came and took us to the snorkeling.

1163
01:06:28,620 --> 01:06:28,801
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1164
01:06:28,942 --> 01:06:32,782
Speaker 1: And it knew that we were supposed to go there and knew that we had signed up for that.

1165
01:06:33,225 --> 01:06:34,939
Speaker 1: We went snorkeling and then it took us back.

1166
01:06:35,140 --> 01:06:35,321
Speaker 0: Yep.

1167
01:06:35,502 --> 01:06:38,379
Speaker 1: You know, you know what of the very much like that, too.

1168
01:06:38,921 --> 01:06:41,500
Speaker 0: All the ski resort hotels are just like that.

1169
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:45,780
Speaker 0: Like you go to the hotel and literally they'll just be like you check into the hotel.

1170
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:48,540
Speaker 1: They give you lift tickets with your room key up like they give you all the shit.

1171
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:52,578
Speaker 0: And they're like the first shuttle to this resort, like this mountain will be at 8 a.m.

1172
01:06:53,642 --> 01:06:54,144
Speaker 0: over there.

1173
01:06:54,466 --> 01:06:56,919
Speaker 0: Like everything's just arranged to get you to the slopes.

1174
01:06:58,460 --> 01:07:01,520
Speaker 1: The integration is really, you know, and it's a way.

1175
01:07:01,740 --> 01:07:02,669
Speaker 1: And why do they do this?

1176
01:07:02,770 --> 01:07:03,840
Speaker 1: Well, A, it's nice.

1177
01:07:03,980 --> 01:07:06,720
Speaker 1: It's convenient, but it takes more money out of you.

1178
01:07:07,040 --> 01:07:07,281
Speaker 1: Right.

1179
01:07:07,301 --> 01:07:10,454
Speaker 1: Yes, because I could go as easy as possible to get more.

1180
01:07:10,574 --> 01:07:11,397
Speaker 1: to take my

1181
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:25,442
Speaker 0: example if that snorkeling example, if you were if I was somewhere like in Costa Rica at a resort, I could go online, look at all the snorkeling companies in the area, figure out which one was the best value, call them, try to get an appointment or I could just say, hotel, take care of this.

1182
01:07:25,764 --> 01:07:28,721
Speaker 0: Of course, the hotel is going to give me the most expensive one and take a car.

1183
01:07:28,741 --> 01:07:31,820
Speaker 1: Well, no, not the most expensive one, but the one that they have a deal with.

1184
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:32,062
Speaker 1: Right.

1185
01:07:32,082 --> 01:07:34,280
Speaker 1: The hotel is probably going to get a cut of my snorkel.

1186
01:07:34,421 --> 01:07:35,447
Speaker 0: That's the important thing.

1187
01:07:35,749 --> 01:07:37,700
Speaker 0: It's probably not going to be the cheapest.

1188
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,640
Speaker 1: Probably a referral fees, you know, going in on there.

1189
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,540
Speaker 0: It would probably be cheaper if you arranged it all yourself.

1190
01:07:44,320 --> 01:07:49,040
Speaker 0: But the whole point of a vacation is to not have to deal with that crap and all.

1191
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:54,760
Speaker 0: But also they have an ulterior motive of the more they reduce that friction, the more you might spend if you wouldn't otherwise.

1192
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:57,820
Speaker 0: Kind of like when I quit that job where I was really easy to go.

1193
01:07:57,960 --> 01:07:59,840
Speaker 1: So maybe, you know, I was so easy to go snorkeling.

1194
01:07:59,940 --> 01:08:05,620
Speaker 1: Maybe when I get back from snorkeling, I walk past the concierge and I'm like, hey, can I go parasailing tomorrow?

1195
01:08:06,223 --> 01:08:06,668
Speaker 0: OK, yeah.

1196
01:08:06,688 --> 01:08:07,619
Speaker 1: Like, hey, what do you want to go?

1197
01:08:08,121 --> 01:08:08,899
Speaker 1: One, two, three.

1198
01:08:09,140 --> 01:08:11,620
Speaker 0: They like they might suggest something you didn't even think you wanted to do.

1199
01:08:11,680 --> 01:08:13,259
Speaker 0: And they're like, yeah, I could do that.

1200
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:15,480
Speaker 1: And they'll almost all have to go to work.

1201
01:08:15,680 --> 01:08:16,450
Speaker 1: I'm on vacation.

1202
01:08:16,551 --> 01:08:17,118
Speaker 0: Take my money.

1203
01:08:17,620 --> 01:08:23,520
Speaker 0: They will almost always these resort hotels not tell you what something costs unless you ask.

1204
01:08:24,743 --> 01:08:33,419
Speaker 0: I have noticed that, you know, kind of like how a restaurant, the fanciest restaurants often just won't have prices in their menu.

1205
01:08:33,804 --> 01:08:34,680
Speaker 0: One, that's a danger sign.

1206
01:08:34,740 --> 01:08:35,307
Speaker 0: Get the fuck out.

1207
01:08:35,346 --> 01:08:36,279
Speaker 0: You're in deep shit now.

1208
01:08:37,522 --> 01:08:37,883
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

1209
01:08:39,631 --> 01:08:41,819
Speaker 0: But to like fancy restaurants that have prices.

1210
01:08:41,981 --> 01:08:49,100
Speaker 0: Notice when a server like if you go to a TGI Fridays or like a normal restaurant, they'll they'll be like, oh, yeah, our special today is blah.

1211
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:52,160
Speaker 0: It's forty nine dollars or twelve dollars or eight dollars.

1212
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:59,120
Speaker 0: But if you go to these fancy places and resort hotels do this for everything, they'll tell you what the appetizers are and what the specials are.

1213
01:08:59,401 --> 01:09:02,460
Speaker 0: And they will not mention the prices at all unless you ask specifically.

1214
01:09:03,281 --> 01:09:03,421
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1215
01:09:04,004 --> 01:09:08,754
Speaker 1: Also, the the next level of resort hotel is the one where, like, the rooms are somehow integrated.

1216
01:09:08,997 --> 01:09:09,200
Speaker 1: Right.

1217
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:16,694
Speaker 1: So like the like your room is literally on the beach and like has a hot tub and you walk right out onto the sand to where now you're.

1218
01:09:16,734 --> 01:09:18,080
Speaker 1: the room is your destination.

1219
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:20,080
Speaker 1: You're like, I want to go vacation to that room.

1220
01:09:20,161 --> 01:09:21,319
Speaker 1: Look how amazing that room is.

1221
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:22,479
Speaker 0: So I was your vacation.

1222
01:09:22,740 --> 01:09:35,136
Speaker 0: I was thinking about this years ago when we went whenever I did that trip to Costa Rica because it's actually really cheap to rent like a whole giant house on the beach with like private hot tub and everything like way cheap.

1223
01:09:36,562 --> 01:09:38,457
Speaker 0: Of course, a lot of tropical places are like that.

1224
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:41,260
Speaker 0: Loki thought about doing a party at a place like that.

1225
01:09:41,380 --> 01:09:45,337
Speaker 0: I just never followed up because as a pain in the ass to coordinate the logistics of.

1226
01:09:46,481 --> 01:09:50,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, hotels and travel are really fascinating, I guess.

1227
01:09:50,160 --> 01:09:52,680
Speaker 1: Well, let's end on the Airbnb, because that's the new development.

1228
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:53,341
Speaker 1: Right.

1229
01:09:53,402 --> 01:10:02,261
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, so I'm not a fan of Airbnb specifically, you know, not only because it's, you know, the lot of problems with it, it's almost as bad as Uber, but not quite.

1230
01:10:02,743 --> 01:10:17,000
Speaker 1: But my number one gripe with Airbnb is that at least in the United States is that there's a set of regulations around hotels that are all mostly, you know, regardless of how well they're enforced and or whatnot, you know, they're mostly good with intent.

1231
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:17,561
Speaker 1: Right.

1232
01:10:17,581 --> 01:10:29,240
Speaker 1: Hotels have to have certain fire safety requirements and they have to some of those services that they provide or services that, you know, are, like I said, are vestiges of the old times or they just do it because it makes them money.

1233
01:10:29,300 --> 01:10:37,340
Speaker 0: But some of them, they're required to provide and sometimes it comes down to the capacity of the local infrastructure or community to take out a bunch of visitors.

1234
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,280
Speaker 0: Like there's a lot of stuff going on there.

1235
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:48,179
Speaker 1: The hotel has to have an elevator and be ADA compliant and it has to, you know, there's just certain things that hotel, an official real hotel must do.

1236
01:10:48,781 --> 01:10:49,062
Speaker 1: Right.

1237
01:10:49,563 --> 01:10:55,822
Speaker 1: And Airbnb is basically much like Uber taxis, avoid all the laws about what taxis have to do.

1238
01:10:55,843 --> 01:11:00,662
Speaker 1: Airbnb is just someone renting their house or apartment out for a very short period of time.

1239
01:11:00,682 --> 01:11:05,480
Speaker 1: And there was none of those regulations are applying to that place.

1240
01:11:05,820 --> 01:11:18,400
Speaker 0: Never mind the fact that a huge number of things on Airbnb are being like straight up illegally rented out because they are buildings that for local laws, in many cases, cannot be used as hotels because that's a big problem in big cities.

1241
01:11:19,421 --> 01:11:26,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can have a place that is like not suitable for habitation and definitely not suitable for temporary habitation.

1242
01:11:26,763 --> 01:11:29,320
Speaker 1: And yet someone gets rented out on Airbnb and make some money.

1243
01:11:29,460 --> 01:11:29,722
Speaker 1: Right.

1244
01:11:29,762 --> 01:11:33,680
Speaker 1: And it's like that's, you know, not cool that someone should be allowed to do that.

1245
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:34,142
Speaker 1: Right.

1246
01:11:34,342 --> 01:11:41,880
Speaker 1: If you're going to if you're going to have a shelter and charge people money to stay in it, that shelter should have to meet certain requirements.

1247
01:11:43,321 --> 01:11:43,542
Speaker 1: Right.

1248
01:11:43,702 --> 01:11:55,260
Speaker 1: But that being said, the fundamental concept of you are the renter or owner of a space that you are not in need of and someone else needs a shelter.

1249
01:11:55,340 --> 01:12:00,318
Speaker 1: I do think you should be able to come to an arrangement as long as a shelter is suitable.

1250
01:12:01,240 --> 01:12:04,800
Speaker 0: A good example, because we just I just booked one, is a beach house.

1251
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:08,741
Speaker 0: Like if someone owns a beach house, like they just own it, it's their private beach house.

1252
01:12:09,183 --> 01:12:14,015
Speaker 0: Makes sense that there should be a framework to allow that person to rent it out to other people when they're not using it.

1253
01:12:15,020 --> 01:12:15,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's only.

1254
01:12:15,464 --> 01:12:17,200
Speaker 1: that's just efficient use of resources.

1255
01:12:18,502 --> 01:12:23,823
Speaker 1: You know, so that part of it is it's just the details, right, that I don't like Airbnb specifically.

1256
01:12:23,843 --> 01:12:29,524
Speaker 1: The concept, though, the core of shelter is unused, someone else wants to use it.

1257
01:12:29,646 --> 01:12:30,519
Speaker 1: We can arrange that.

1258
01:12:30,620 --> 01:12:31,142
Speaker 1: That is good.

1259
01:12:31,363 --> 01:12:44,379
Speaker 0: Well, all all we really need is some some regulations around this, because the main problem with Airbnb is specifically in cities where on the properties that are unused, that are being rented out, rented out would be used.

1260
01:12:44,641 --> 01:12:48,960
Speaker 0: They are purposefully made unused to then be sold for a profit via Airbnb.

1261
01:12:49,701 --> 01:12:50,103
Speaker 1: Exactly.

1262
01:12:50,123 --> 01:12:55,400
Speaker 1: If you look at like you could say you could look at an apartment in New York City and the rent on that apartment could be like three thousand dollars.

1263
01:12:55,520 --> 01:12:59,340
Speaker 1: You know, holy shit, that's a big rent, right, for like a two bedroom or some shit.

1264
01:12:59,400 --> 01:12:59,923
Speaker 1: But guess what?

1265
01:13:00,505 --> 01:13:04,542
Speaker 1: An Airbnb will make three thousand dollars at five hundred a night in six days.

1266
01:13:04,563 --> 01:13:12,859
Speaker 1: That rent of three thousand dollars would be for 30 days, five times, five times as much revenue from Airbnb being instead of renting.

1267
01:13:13,420 --> 01:13:13,541
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1268
01:13:13,661 --> 01:13:18,180
Speaker 0: I mean, look, my rent, this apartment, I pay well over a hundred dollars a night.

1269
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:21,444
Speaker 0: If this were a hotel, I'm paying over a hundred bucks a night, like well over to live here.

1270
01:13:21,750 --> 01:13:22,056
Speaker 1: Whoa.

1271
01:13:22,942 --> 01:13:23,185
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1272
01:13:23,771 --> 01:13:24,640
Speaker 0: So stay in the chief apartment.

1273
01:13:25,560 --> 01:13:26,008
Speaker 1: I'm paying.

1274
01:13:26,212 --> 01:13:26,700
Speaker 1: We're paying.

1275
01:13:27,161 --> 01:13:27,830
Speaker 1: I don't know if we're paying.

1276
01:13:27,871 --> 01:13:28,499
Speaker 1: I got to figure that.

1277
01:13:28,641 --> 01:13:30,100
Speaker 1: Oh, no, because it's times two.

1278
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:30,743
Speaker 1: It's two people.

1279
01:13:31,005 --> 01:13:31,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe.

1280
01:13:34,040 --> 01:13:34,342
Speaker 1: Anyway.

1281
01:13:34,382 --> 01:13:34,523
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1282
01:13:34,724 --> 01:13:37,800
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know what a hotel costs in this neighborhood?

1283
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,799
Speaker 0: Like four hundred bucks a night.

1284
01:13:40,481 --> 01:13:41,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

1285
01:13:41,543 --> 01:13:47,600
Speaker 0: So I could like literally just get another apartment.

1286
01:13:48,402 --> 01:13:50,140
Speaker 0: Rent this one out on Airbnb like a hotel.

1287
01:13:50,660 --> 01:13:54,059
Speaker 0: I would make so much profit that I could pay for both apartments with that.

1288
01:13:54,800 --> 01:13:55,939
Speaker 1: Well, judging by my math.

1289
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:56,422
Speaker 1: Right.

1290
01:13:56,443 --> 01:13:57,220
Speaker 1: Four hundred and nine.

1291
01:13:57,441 --> 01:13:59,220
Speaker 1: Well, you will use your more conservative number.

1292
01:13:59,340 --> 01:14:00,115
Speaker 1: Four hundred a night.

1293
01:14:00,156 --> 01:14:00,340
Speaker 1: Right.

1294
01:14:00,740 --> 01:14:00,841
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1295
01:14:00,942 --> 01:14:03,180
Speaker 1: Instead of the one hundred a night that you are paying.

1296
01:14:03,421 --> 01:14:03,704
Speaker 1: Right.

1297
01:14:04,127 --> 01:14:05,680
Speaker 1: So that comes out to four.

1298
01:14:05,820 --> 01:14:08,880
Speaker 1: So you could actually buy Airbnb being one apartment.

1299
01:14:09,303 --> 01:14:11,040
Speaker 1: You could then use the money you get.

1300
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:13,960
Speaker 1: You had to pay one fourth of that to pay for the rent.

1301
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:15,034
Speaker 0: I could get three more apartments.

1302
01:14:15,721 --> 01:14:16,283
Speaker 0: You could.

1303
01:14:16,904 --> 01:14:21,739
Speaker 1: you could get three more apartments or get three more and rent two of them out on Airbnb.

1304
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,260
Speaker 1: But it's like and the end run of this.

1305
01:14:24,440 --> 01:14:28,540
Speaker 1: If you just live in an apartment three times as nice as the one that you're up.

1306
01:14:28,821 --> 01:14:37,680
Speaker 0: Or more likely, I am now a slumlord and I am just siphoning money out of the economy and people in the world into myself and providing nothing.

1307
01:14:38,561 --> 01:14:38,802
Speaker 1: Yes.

1308
01:14:38,983 --> 01:14:50,860
Speaker 1: So I think, you know, there should definitely be some sort of regulation that if you are, you know, hoteling something that is an apartment that the price needs to be per night, the rent divided by the day thirty thirty.

1309
01:14:51,080 --> 01:14:51,160
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1310
01:14:51,181 --> 01:14:52,729
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, there's a lot of the thing.

1311
01:14:52,769 --> 01:14:54,397
Speaker 0: is we just need regulation?

1312
01:14:54,437 --> 01:14:54,940
Speaker 0: that's sensible.

1313
01:14:55,121 --> 01:14:57,234
Speaker 0: But that's impossible in America for all the reasons.

1314
01:14:57,274 --> 01:14:58,260
Speaker 0: we've talked about a lot.

1315
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:00,960
Speaker 0: Get back to that West Virginia thing and your mansion.

1316
01:15:01,861 --> 01:15:03,690
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1317
01:15:03,851 --> 01:15:05,780
Speaker 1: Hotels are hotels are kind of cool.

1318
01:15:06,040 --> 01:15:06,946
Speaker 1: There's a lot of problems.

1319
01:15:06,966 --> 01:15:09,200
Speaker 1: There's a lot of interesting things going on.

1320
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:10,769
Speaker 0: And I tell some anecdotes.

1321
01:15:10,849 --> 01:15:13,938
Speaker 0: We've already gone on really long on this episode and I'm hungry, so I kind of want to wrap it up.

1322
01:15:14,540 --> 01:15:14,946
Speaker 1: All right.

1323
01:15:14,986 --> 01:15:15,879
Speaker 1: First, that's why.

1324
01:15:16,081 --> 01:15:16,406
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1325
01:15:16,671 --> 01:15:16,956
Speaker 0: Damn it.

1326
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:29,020
Speaker 0: I it's weird how much I miss hotels, because usually when I go into a hotel, that is because I'm about to also be at a gaming convention.

1327
01:15:30,061 --> 01:15:30,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

1328
01:15:31,327 --> 01:15:34,540
Speaker 0: Either a gaming convention or a party or a vacation.

1329
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:39,505
Speaker 1: And I didn't even talk about like hotels also being in the business of renting out ballrooms and stuff.

1330
01:15:39,626 --> 01:15:41,960
Speaker 1: There's a side business catering and whatnot.

1331
01:15:42,564 --> 01:15:44,040
Speaker 0: So maybe you got some Thursday shows here.

1332
01:15:44,221 --> 01:15:45,800
Speaker 0: But anyway, we've made enough of a show and I'm done.

1333
01:15:51,264 --> 01:15:53,400
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1334
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:58,724
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

1335
01:15:58,925 --> 01:16:03,939
Speaker 1: Be sure to visit our website at FrontRowCrew.com for show notes, discussion news and more.

1336
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:11,640
Speaker 0: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows, SciTech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

1337
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,136
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is distributed under a Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 license.

1338
01:16:16,460 --> 01:16:19,399
Speaker 1: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1339
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:22,600
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1340
01:16:23,981 --> 01:16:49,759
Speaker 0: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are Heidi McNichol, Alan Joyce, Lingkiji, Dread Lily, Tenebrae, Chris Reimer, Quinton Walton, Just Like a Dude Guy, Kashyaya, 85, Program, Threat, Open Speed, Undertake, Law, Adoption, Pierce, Absorb, Rebecca Dunn, Review, Badbull, 34, Cowards, Ryan, Parent, Sam Erickson, Shervin, Mountharl, Taylor Braun, You Hold the Key to My Heart and a whole bunch of people who do not want me to say their names.

1341
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,299
Speaker 0: So yeah, we started the stream.

1342
01:16:51,420 --> 01:17:05,464
Speaker 0: There wasn't audio at the beginning because the audio profiles for what track is written to for stuff in OBS for various reasons is a global setting, or at least in the version of OBS that I've got running.

1343
01:17:05,987 --> 01:17:08,040
Speaker 0: And I had to rejigger everything to record that panel.

1344
01:17:08,882 --> 01:17:11,179
Speaker 0: And it was actually annoying to set that back.

1345
01:17:11,821 --> 01:17:22,240
Speaker 0: So at some point after COVID starts winding down and Scott comes into the studio once or twice, I think it's time to actually rebuild the Geek Nights pipeline from scratch.

1346
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:40,059
Speaker 0: So for all of you Patreon patrons, I'm going to actually post some diagrams and things in the coming month or two of how I reworked that, what the old pipeline was, what the new one is going to be, why I'm changing certain things, like basically give you a guide of what the pipeline looks like to record a show like this.

1347
01:17:41,021 --> 01:17:41,825
Speaker 0: I got to do it anyway.

1348
01:17:41,885 --> 01:17:45,957
Speaker 0: Like I have to write all that stuff up and document it and make the diagrams to even do it.

1349
01:17:46,381 --> 01:17:49,077
Speaker 0: So I might as well share it with you instead of just deleting them like I normally do.

1350
01:17:49,941 --> 01:17:55,665
Speaker 0: The last time we did a big pipeline redirection and change was right at the beginning of quarantine.

1351
01:17:55,685 --> 01:17:56,980
Speaker 0: But even then, I kind of hacked it together.

1352
01:17:57,632 --> 01:18:00,800
Speaker 0: The last one before that was 2017.

1353
01:18:00,800 --> 01:18:04,475
Speaker 0: But anyway, for now, tonight, I leave you with...

1354
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:10,780
Speaker 1: Then let our polluting powers combine!

1355
01:18:11,621 --> 01:18:12,700
Speaker 1: Super radiation!

1356
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,016
Speaker 1: Depoletation!

1357
01:18:16,366 --> 01:18:16,534
Speaker 1: Mog!

1358
01:18:21,265 --> 01:18:21,509
Speaker 0: Hey!

1359
01:18:26,913 --> 01:18:29,590
Speaker 0: Are your polluting powers combined?

1360
01:18:29,972 --> 01:18:33,149
Speaker 0: I am Captain Pollution!
