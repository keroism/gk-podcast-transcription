1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:12,230
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday May 28th on rim.

2
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:14,778
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight.

3
00:00:14,798 --> 00:00:15,600
Speaker 1: We change it up a bit.

4
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:19,899
Speaker 1: We talk about whiteout the comic and animals that suck the anime.

5
00:00:25,891 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,873 --> 00:00:32,014
Speaker 0: So you know that watchman movie.

7
00:00:32,034 --> 00:00:34,736
Speaker 0: They're making uh-huh yeah, yeah, I'm not.

8
00:00:34,836 --> 00:00:46,186
Speaker 0: I haven't been like I don't know interested to see any movie especially not in the theater in forever but this movie They have done some things.

9
00:00:46,246 --> 00:00:56,946
Speaker 0: two things that have actually raised my interest of seeing in the theater from negative a billion to negative 999 million all right.

10
00:00:57,407 --> 00:01:04,569
Speaker 0: two things that that have given me confidence that this movie well actually three things But that have given me confidence.

11
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:14,659
Speaker 0: three three things that have given me confidence The Pope right That this movie might not be to suck and will.

12
00:01:17,527 --> 00:01:25,813
Speaker 0: Number one Every picture from the movie that I see every photograph online Pretty much looks like the comic brought to life.

13
00:01:25,994 --> 00:01:28,407
Speaker 0: I mean the latest picture I saw was a pit.

14
00:01:28,427 --> 00:01:29,211
Speaker 0: you know how.

15
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:31,240
Speaker 0: I don't want to try to spoil anything.

16
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:32,243
Speaker 0: You know the.

17
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:35,431
Speaker 0: in between like chapters one and two there's like that sort of.

18
00:01:35,672 --> 00:01:45,592
Speaker 0: I guess it's an illustration of a photograph of Like the original old superhero team with like the guy in the hood, and I know all the old old guys The whatever they were.

19
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:55,239
Speaker 0: yes There was a photograph released of like you know pretty much people in costumes You know you have making and it was looked exactly like the thing from the comic.

20
00:01:55,299 --> 00:01:58,212
Speaker 0: only It was you know a picture of real people huh in costumes.

21
00:01:58,474 --> 00:01:58,996
Speaker 0: I'll show it to you.

22
00:01:59,036 --> 00:01:59,458
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

23
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:04,592
Speaker 0: - right I have received a. well.

24
00:02:04,652 --> 00:02:12,540
Speaker 0: I have found I didn't receive it a Reliable word that this movie will be almost three hours long.

25
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,245
Speaker 1: Whoo that you know.

26
00:02:15,285 --> 00:02:16,048
Speaker 1: it's weird you think.

27
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,995
Speaker 1: ah that just means if it's bad.

28
00:02:18,317 --> 00:02:19,200
Speaker 1: It'll never end.

29
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:19,947
Speaker 1: That's true, but

30
00:02:20,028 --> 00:02:20,553
Speaker 0: I know what it

31
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:35,398
Speaker 1: means to me Is that they're letting the people making it do what they think is right because it's very rare For the producers whoever is involved in the making of a movie to let someone say yeah I'm gonna make this movie longer than you know the short average movies everyone sees.

32
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,044
Speaker 1: hmm That's a big risk.

33
00:02:37,285 --> 00:02:48,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, it because that tells me you know in order to make this movie done Right you can't be leaving too much shit out, so if they're making it almost three hours We're reaching like the limit of what Hollywood's willing to deal with.

34
00:02:48,791 --> 00:03:02,969
Speaker 0: that tells me that they're leaving all the important shit in now If you know if you've read Watchmen you know that there's some particular things that might be left out of the movie perhaps a Story about a black freighter, so

35
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:06,280
Speaker 1: I imagine you've discovered that they have incorporated it a hundred percent.

36
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:08,388
Speaker 0: No, not at all all right.

37
00:03:08,770 --> 00:03:10,999
Speaker 0: It's in fact perhaps better than that.

38
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:17,853
Speaker 0: There's also You know the the pros parts in between the actual chapters of comic.

39
00:03:18,214 --> 00:03:19,257
Speaker 0: right all right?

40
00:03:19,277 --> 00:03:20,299
Speaker 1: How could it be better than that?

41
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:29,631
Speaker 0: Hi, all right, so There's three hours of movie and there are two obvious Parts of the graphic novel that would be cut out of any movie.

42
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,654
Speaker 1: are there intermissions?

43
00:03:31,055 --> 00:03:32,500
Speaker 0: no that would be awesome.

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,444
Speaker 0: No, that would be wicked.

45
00:03:33,564 --> 00:03:44,153
Speaker 0: They're just an intermission for every single chapter like a little tiny one anyway I know what they're gonna Do is they have filmed right the black freighter and they have.

46
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,100
Speaker 0: they have somehow filmed the the pros parts?

47
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:59,091
Speaker 0: right those parts are going to be released on a DVD that you'll watch and Then go to the movie or go to the movie and then watch the DVD.

48
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:06,694
Speaker 0: really yeah, so there's three hours of movie But that stuff is also there, but that's not part of those three hours man.

49
00:04:06,895 --> 00:04:17,959
Speaker 1: We you know luckily living in New York I'm sure there's gonna be a theater where we can see the black freighter, and then the Watchmen Maybe maybe maybe but if not granted honestly easily get the DVD.

50
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:22,780
Speaker 1: I almost feel like if I were you'd probably better off seeing the freighter after the Watchmen.

51
00:04:22,981 --> 00:04:24,569
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't really I mean for us.

52
00:04:24,609 --> 00:04:25,112
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

53
00:04:25,152 --> 00:04:26,519
Speaker 0: What order cuz you've read the book?

54
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm thinking in general after seems better than before.

55
00:04:29,632 --> 00:04:35,311
Speaker 0: yeah the thing that still you know I'm gonna keep pushing people to read the Watchmen before this movie comes out.

56
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:38,140
Speaker 0: read it before the movie cut read it again.

57
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,766
Speaker 1: Yes, even though it's not in the book club.

58
00:04:39,927 --> 00:04:40,208
Speaker 1: Yes.

59
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:43,220
Speaker 0: It will be read it and then you know.

60
00:04:43,381 --> 00:04:51,300
Speaker 0: I'm still worried though that if I own the comic book store or even a bookstore I would team up with the local movie theater to fucking sell the book.

61
00:04:51,924 --> 00:04:54,360
Speaker 0: I don't think there's gonna be enough book selling going on.

62
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,455
Speaker 0: I mean when V for Vendetta came out they were selling the book.

63
00:04:57,495 --> 00:04:58,500
Speaker 0: you know more than usual.

64
00:04:58,601 --> 00:05:00,500
Speaker 0: You know what I would but not nearly enough.

65
00:05:00,641 --> 00:05:01,645
Speaker 1: You know what I would do.

66
00:05:01,665 --> 00:05:13,343
Speaker 1: I would set up a promotion where if I were a movie theater I'd make a deal with a local bookseller even just do it myself with Amazon where I would sell the book at a slight Discount.

67
00:05:13,464 --> 00:05:19,151
Speaker 1: if you brought a theos ticket like a stub to my place And I'd even sell the books in the theaters.

68
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:21,220
Speaker 0: people need they do need to sell the book in the theater.

69
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:21,943
Speaker 0: That's definite.

70
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:30,485
Speaker 0: I think they should do is if you buy the book Right you get like a pass that will like you know one of the big Maybe not.

71
00:05:30,505 --> 00:05:35,089
Speaker 0: you know the local movie theater on the local level But like on the big level maybe like I don't know.

72
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:36,213
Speaker 0: pick a movie theater chain.

73
00:05:36,414 --> 00:05:38,020
Speaker 0: crown crown is a movie theater chain.

74
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:39,697
Speaker 1: Right I don't even know anymore.

75
00:05:39,778 --> 00:05:40,482
Speaker 1: AMC I guess.

76
00:05:40,764 --> 00:05:41,427
Speaker 0: so AMC.

77
00:05:41,668 --> 00:05:42,934
Speaker 0: AMC is definitely a theater chain.

78
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:44,120
Speaker 0: Lowe's Lowe's is a good one too.

79
00:05:44,521 --> 00:05:53,720
Speaker 0: One of those big movie theater chain companies makes a deal with DC Comics and cuz you know they're gonna read Reprinting this as we speak right to put more on the shelves, right?

80
00:05:53,901 --> 00:05:58,240
Speaker 0: It's never been out of print because as soon as it goes out of print Alan Moore gets the rights back.

81
00:05:58,420 --> 00:06:02,633
Speaker 0: So and then DC's in deep shit, so it's definitely still in print.

82
00:06:02,673 --> 00:06:06,167
Speaker 0: so what they should start doing is the next batch You know the next run.

83
00:06:06,187 --> 00:06:12,019
Speaker 0: they should slip a coupon in there Maybe for free tickets or half off tickets at a specific theater chain.

84
00:06:12,441 --> 00:06:15,495
Speaker 0: You know do a little D. You know big-time partnership action going on.

85
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:16,258
Speaker 0: I don't know.

86
00:06:17,102 --> 00:06:23,222
Speaker 0: They definitely need to do something to get people to buy the book buy the book read it Amazon Jeep Right.

87
00:06:23,545 --> 00:06:25,700
Speaker 1: so I don't really have a news cuz we're gonna get right into this.

88
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:35,359
Speaker 1: We're doing a dual review tonight partly because we want to get through this stuff and partly cuz a lot more you are anime fans Than comic fans, so we're very pointedly putting the comic review first.

89
00:06:36,123 --> 00:06:36,826
Speaker 1: Uh-huh plus.

90
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:39,900
Speaker 1: uh I think a lot of people who are into anime will probably like this comic.

91
00:06:40,222 --> 00:06:42,740
Speaker 1: Maybe well at least if you're into good manga.

92
00:06:43,642 --> 00:06:57,520
Speaker 1: But before we continue I just want to point out to everyone I know I mentioned it last week, but Friday this week as in Well, this is a Wednesday episode so Two days from now, but you're probably listening to this Thursday.

93
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:09,454
Speaker 1: So that means tomorrow May 30th at 6 p.m.. In 2008 in the Kinokuniya bookstore near Bryant Park in New York City We will be there with Tokyo FM and Brian Nishi to interview Hal Cali.

94
00:07:09,996 --> 00:07:12,219
Speaker 1: They are they perform today, Sen They're pretty awesome.

95
00:07:13,081 --> 00:07:17,708
Speaker 1: You might notice that you might know them from my thing of the day if you're a time traveler.

96
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:25,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, and If you want to learn about them you can learn about them the same way I learned about them and watch all their music videos on the YouTube.

97
00:07:26,109 --> 00:07:32,274
Speaker 1: or just come to the Kinokuniya this Friday May 30th Despite the fact that anime news network knows nothing about it.

98
00:07:32,816 --> 00:07:33,640
Speaker 0: They will soon.

99
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:45,220
Speaker 1: Seriously though it'll if you're a fan of these two You'll be able to get pretty close to him because the Kinokuni is not that big and TMR pretty much filled the upstairs.

100
00:07:45,661 --> 00:07:49,795
Speaker 0: You'll also get to see us if you want to see us, and you haven't seen us.

101
00:07:50,497 --> 00:07:53,037
Speaker 0: so yeah I guess some people might want to see us.

102
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,972
Speaker 0: Okay, so we went to the New York Comic Con and at the Oni table.

103
00:07:57,232 --> 00:07:59,479
Speaker 0: There are some pretty awesome books going down.

104
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:01,048
Speaker 0: Rim bought a little.

105
00:08:01,309 --> 00:08:04,084
Speaker 0: uh you buy the Scott Pilgrim poster there I might have.

106
00:08:04,124 --> 00:08:10,364
Speaker 0: yeah, but the thing is I was gonna buy some of those awesome books But I had ordered them pre-ordered them online.

107
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:11,446
Speaker 0: so about a week later.

108
00:08:11,466 --> 00:08:11,947
Speaker 0: They showed up.

109
00:08:12,588 --> 00:08:22,100
Speaker 0: one of those awesome books is Whiteout by Gregor written by Greg Rucka art by Steve Lieber alright, and it's actually two volumes of it.

110
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:26,720
Speaker 0: But rim only read the first volume, so I'm also gonna talk about the first volume now Greg Rucka.

111
00:08:27,981 --> 00:08:29,446
Speaker 0: This guy is lately.

112
00:08:29,526 --> 00:08:33,960
Speaker 0: He's like my favorite new writing of comics guy favorite new comic star.

113
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:46,151
Speaker 0: He's not new, but he's like my new favorite comics writer as and I discovered him somewhat recently He wrote that Gotham Central, which is all about the police in Gotham City and not so much Batman But mostly the police who there.

114
00:08:46,675 --> 00:08:57,835
Speaker 0: he wrote Queen and country which is a many multi-volume series of awesome British secret agent international CIA kind of action.

115
00:08:57,855 --> 00:09:03,037
Speaker 0: and He wrote whiteout which is what we're gonna talk about here now before we go any further.

116
00:09:03,057 --> 00:09:07,996
Speaker 1: if you just want the Soundbite review it's a comic that I liked.

117
00:09:08,599 --> 00:09:18,687
Speaker 1: oh no I mean It's really always the best recommendation you can get about something Oftentimes is from someone who hates that thing.

118
00:09:18,727 --> 00:09:28,120
Speaker 1: of course that doesn't always work because if someone really hates superhero comics And then they read a superhero comic that they like odds are it's not like superhero comics.

119
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:32,518
Speaker 1: So if you like normal superhero comics you probably won't like the things that they like mmm.

120
00:09:33,326 --> 00:09:35,624
Speaker 0: Anyway whiteout To sum it up.

121
00:09:35,724 --> 00:09:39,800
Speaker 0: It's basically a whodunit murder mystery kind of deal, right?

122
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,343
Speaker 0: So there's not.

123
00:09:41,363 --> 00:09:43,172
Speaker 0: you know the the if you look at it.

124
00:09:43,312 --> 00:09:46,048
Speaker 0: You know from such a zoomed out perspective It's not really exciting.

125
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:47,599
Speaker 0: what is exciting about it?

126
00:09:47,861 --> 00:09:51,954
Speaker 0: And I think the the best part of this book is the fact that it's in Antarctica.

127
00:09:52,195 --> 00:10:03,205
Speaker 0: now the setting of Antarctica You know and I guess it's a cool setting that's not used too often especially not for murder mysteries Like many people are there You know.

128
00:10:03,566 --> 00:10:23,098
Speaker 0: but what gets me about this book and actually makes me really interested in, Antarctica And I kind of want to go there now is that since the setting of Antarctica It's such a dangerous barren place with no people the setting almost becomes a character in this book Basically a character that's out to fuck everyone all of the time.

129
00:10:23,781 --> 00:10:23,861
Speaker 0: You

130
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:46,079
Speaker 1: know actually it's very interesting because I might have said it with somewhat more eloquence than that But much like if you read the terror that the book I think I talked about it a while ago It's about a bunch of Arctic explorers who eventually get trapped in the ice And I don't think it's a spoiler to say that they pretty much all died because it's based on a true story and in the true Story everyone pretty much all died.

131
00:10:46,783 --> 00:10:58,153
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, but there's a lot of similar stories that I've you know well stories that use the same mechanism like you read a submarine story and there's always that constant dread of the Dangers of what it's like on a submarine.

132
00:10:58,193 --> 00:11:00,744
Speaker 0: or you read a like tank police.

133
00:11:00,764 --> 00:11:03,312
Speaker 0: you read tank police and it's like the constant dangers of.

134
00:11:03,532 --> 00:11:08,789
Speaker 0: you know the cloud of bacterial gas outside or So you know people are in space.

135
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:14,833
Speaker 0: Apollo 13 is a perfect example where you know space and and the shuttle are a character in themselves.

136
00:11:15,255 --> 00:11:18,866
Speaker 0: you know providing all of the Conflict for the characters.

137
00:11:18,987 --> 00:11:20,212
Speaker 0: you know taking the role of.

138
00:11:20,272 --> 00:11:21,960
Speaker 0: you know the villain in what you will.

139
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:27,500
Speaker 0: But this book actually has you know a villain and that is you know the murderer and whatnot.

140
00:11:27,982 --> 00:11:31,880
Speaker 0: But it also has the the sort of side villain of Antarctica itself.

141
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:35,959
Speaker 0: It's not so much a villain because it fucks the bad guys just as much as fucks the good guys.

142
00:11:36,982 --> 00:11:45,131
Speaker 0: Anyway, so white out the story centers around this character the main character And she's sort of like this secret.

143
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:46,217
Speaker 0: She's not a secret agent.

144
00:11:46,237 --> 00:11:48,663
Speaker 0: She's like It's hard to say.

145
00:11:48,703 --> 00:11:56,169
Speaker 0: she's like a marshal from the US and she's sort of like the police of Antarctica where No guns are allowed now.

146
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:58,800
Speaker 1: There's an interesting story about why she's working in Antarctica.

147
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,629
Speaker 1: That's I guess that deal throughout the course of the plot.

148
00:12:01,669 --> 00:12:01,990
Speaker 0: That's her.

149
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:09,439
Speaker 0: You know her her personal backstory deal, but It's kind of it's it the fact that no guns are allowed.

150
00:12:09,459 --> 00:12:11,246
Speaker 0: yet She has to police Antarctica.

151
00:12:11,487 --> 00:12:14,660
Speaker 0: at least you know police Antarctica as far as US interests are concerned.

152
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:25,650
Speaker 0: It's so funny because they you know they keep pointing out you know all the things that you know the treaties surrounding Antarctica say you have to do and then everyone breaks all the rules all the time.

153
00:12:25,971 --> 00:12:32,179
Speaker 0: well not everyone not everyone pretty much just Just bad guys and some good guys.

154
00:12:32,421 --> 00:12:35,182
Speaker 1: But it's interesting because you know there's a police officer And they don't say.

155
00:12:35,222 --> 00:12:39,920
Speaker 1: I mean if you don't know about Antarctica you wouldn't think like yeah, duh no guns.

156
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,567
Speaker 1: But they don't really say it outright.

157
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:46,852
Speaker 1: so right away at least you're reading you think cop whatever And then suddenly it's like but you think all right.

158
00:12:46,893 --> 00:12:47,395
Speaker 1: She's a cop.

159
00:12:47,456 --> 00:12:48,260
Speaker 1: Here's the situation.

160
00:12:48,381 --> 00:12:49,508
Speaker 1: She'll just pull a gun and everything.

161
00:12:49,528 --> 00:12:50,273
Speaker 1: Oh wait a minute.

162
00:12:51,239 --> 00:12:53,668
Speaker 1: Oh No guns right.

163
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:58,591
Speaker 0: Yeah, that sort of still ties into the the Antarctica as a character.

164
00:12:58,631 --> 00:13:16,877
Speaker 0: because not just you know the the weather and Physicalness of the continent are dangerous to the characters, but you know the laws and treaties Surrounding you know this international land see also in Almost a cop-out to say the setting is a character when really it's just a setting.

165
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:20,455
Speaker 0: it is But it's a very strong setting that plays heavily.

166
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:22,504
Speaker 1: you know it is But I guess it would what.

167
00:13:22,564 --> 00:13:27,077
Speaker 1: it's a comic and it's mostly dialogue and poses and such and it's drawn black and white.

168
00:13:27,137 --> 00:13:28,344
Speaker 1: so I Don't know that.

169
00:13:28,688 --> 00:13:35,158
Speaker 1: while the setting is very strong I don't know if it has quite as much characterization or any of those things that I'd see and say the terror.

170
00:13:35,178 --> 00:13:38,257
Speaker 0: no No, maybe not, but it's still pretty there.

171
00:13:39,701 --> 00:13:51,460
Speaker 0: Another thing that I really really like I think I like more about this comic than anything else is Greg Raka obviously did a shit ton of research about Antarctica like holy crap.

172
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,950
Speaker 0: Just did he learn like everything there is to know like about.

173
00:13:55,010 --> 00:13:58,620
Speaker 0: you know the weather where all the bases are you know how?

174
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:04,620
Speaker 0: people transport around You know what countries have you know positions where?

175
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:09,700
Speaker 1: At the same Token a lot of that you could get just from reading Wikipedia.

176
00:14:10,242 --> 00:14:12,653
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean he actually bothered to do the research.

177
00:14:12,693 --> 00:14:17,318
Speaker 0: you know when he puts all this information And especially interesting tidbits of the information in the book.

178
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:27,320
Speaker 1: well That's one thing that's very good about it in that a lot of the Information is just part of the story And it just makes sense and it's presented in a kind of sensical sequitur way in the story.

179
00:14:27,521 --> 00:14:30,130
Speaker 1: It's not just like well blah blah blah.

180
00:14:30,371 --> 00:14:31,655
Speaker 1: Here's a map blah blah blah.

181
00:14:31,896 --> 00:14:32,277
Speaker 1: It's just well.

182
00:14:32,297 --> 00:14:33,040
Speaker 1: They're going to this base.

183
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,045
Speaker 1: How are they going to this base?

184
00:14:34,085 --> 00:14:36,859
Speaker 1: and the distances and what's going on makes sense in that context yep?

185
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,740
Speaker 0: But I mean he's telling you a fictional story about fictional characters.

186
00:14:41,242 --> 00:14:48,919
Speaker 0: but the information he gives you about the setting that they're in is Information that is true about the same setting in the real world.

187
00:14:49,882 --> 00:14:55,080
Speaker 0: So you can be entertained by a fictional story and learn about Antarctica at the same time.

188
00:14:55,321 --> 00:14:59,560
Speaker 0: And whenever you learn about something get interested in it, and now I'm interested about Antarctica.

189
00:14:59,861 --> 00:15:02,350
Speaker 1: I don't think you actually want to go to Antarctica.

190
00:15:02,852 --> 00:15:04,639
Speaker 0: I do on the one hand but on the other hand.

191
00:15:04,699 --> 00:15:06,184
Speaker 0: I don't Know.

192
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:15,849
Speaker 1: I mean I think part of the reason I like this was that it was a self-contained story start to finish and while there's kind of background information all this it all kind Of plays in and comes full circle.

193
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,980
Speaker 1: There's no loose ends nothing's left hanging.

194
00:15:18,521 --> 00:15:22,815
Speaker 1: It's just a solid police a little bit procedural kind of adventuring story.

195
00:15:22,935 --> 00:15:23,979
Speaker 1: That's really all there is to it.

196
00:15:24,601 --> 00:15:26,429
Speaker 1: Stylistically, I mean it's really simple.

197
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,720
Speaker 1: It's well it appears very simple.

198
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,072
Speaker 1: I mean just black and white and different textures and all that.

199
00:15:31,152 --> 00:15:35,239
Speaker 1: but when you read the back and he explains you know how he drew it and put it together.

200
00:15:35,259 --> 00:15:45,097
Speaker 1: a lot of work actually went into the composition in the drawing and he'd like put ink and different things and then scratch it away and Do different kinds of art and all the different scenes.

201
00:15:45,439 --> 00:15:50,338
Speaker 0: well I mean think about it right Antarctica is like the perfect setting for a black and white comic book.

202
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,674
Speaker 0: because Instead of you know and say a color comic you know you might need to draw the snow or some such.

203
00:15:55,715 --> 00:15:57,841
Speaker 0: here the pages are White.

204
00:15:58,302 --> 00:16:01,452
Speaker 0: so drawing snow means not drawing.

205
00:16:01,632 --> 00:16:02,515
Speaker 1: yes, cuz then those.

206
00:16:02,675 --> 00:16:05,589
Speaker 1: usually when I print colored comics I print them on black paper.

207
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,897
Speaker 0: I know sometimes they do.

208
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:11,055
Speaker 0: actually You know you'll read like a comic and like all the pages like black around the edge.

209
00:16:11,135 --> 00:16:13,585
Speaker 1: That's ink on paper I know.

210
00:16:13,705 --> 00:16:16,235
Speaker 0: I mean sometimes you know the pages aren't perfectly white either.

211
00:16:16,295 --> 00:16:18,439
Speaker 0: They're sort of yellowish anyway.

212
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,745
Speaker 1: There's no black paper.

213
00:16:22,006 --> 00:16:23,191
Speaker 1: There's construction paper.

214
00:16:23,432 --> 00:16:24,536
Speaker 0: construction paper is cool.

215
00:16:24,596 --> 00:16:25,620
Speaker 0: I like construction paper.

216
00:16:27,316 --> 00:16:29,731
Speaker 0: But Anyway, yeah, I like the art a lot.

217
00:16:29,852 --> 00:16:30,877
Speaker 0: actually you know it might.

218
00:16:30,998 --> 00:16:31,420
Speaker 0: It's not.

219
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:33,646
Speaker 0: It's not very cartoony.

220
00:16:33,686 --> 00:16:39,527
Speaker 1: It's very sort of you know realistic, and I think one thing I noticed I was reading it about halfway through.

221
00:16:39,547 --> 00:16:41,394
Speaker 1: I said wait a minute, so I went over.

222
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:48,365
Speaker 1: I pulled out sanctuary and I flipped over into a few pages, and I flipped through this and the way a lot of.

223
00:16:48,426 --> 00:16:57,800
Speaker 1: I mean it definitely does not have the gecky gah face or The gecky gah pose or any of that, but or especially there's no gecky gah hero.

224
00:16:58,456 --> 00:17:18,487
Speaker 1: No but one thing that it does have is if you look at the way characters stand and The way like all the different frames are kind of put together There they look very similar in terms of it's very Cinematic and very kind of dramatic eyes the way characters stand and the way they move Mm-hmm to where I guess the only.

225
00:17:18,547 --> 00:17:25,633
Speaker 1: if you just took the faces of characters from sanctuary and put them on these characters It would work pretty well a day.

226
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:28,525
Speaker 0: I definitely think that We're pretty well.

227
00:17:28,605 --> 00:17:28,866
Speaker 0: Also.

228
00:17:28,906 --> 00:17:30,371
Speaker 0: I noticed a lot of the paneling.

229
00:17:30,853 --> 00:17:32,980
Speaker 0: You know it's he definitely mixes it up.

230
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:34,529
Speaker 0: It's like somewhere between it.

231
00:17:34,569 --> 00:17:42,624
Speaker 0: You know it's not quite the Typical like you know Marvel Comics kind of boring paneling you know But it's all.

232
00:17:42,685 --> 00:17:45,680
Speaker 0: it's not quite the out-of-control manga paddling.

233
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:51,020
Speaker 0: It's like this nice in-between where some pages will just have like you know like an a box of nine.

234
00:17:51,202 --> 00:17:52,160
Speaker 0: You know rectangles.

235
00:17:52,661 --> 00:18:00,145
Speaker 0: But other pages will do sort of more of a like a Will Eisner sort of open panel on the bottom with like three Overlaying it.

236
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:01,732
Speaker 0: and you know he mixes it up.

237
00:18:01,792 --> 00:18:02,576
Speaker 0: It's it's pretty cool.

238
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:03,319
Speaker 0: I like that action.

239
00:18:03,983 --> 00:18:11,200
Speaker 1: I think the best part about it was that the story escalates Really quickly and it it's kind of it goes faster than you'd expect.

240
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,592
Speaker 1: I mean it starts, and you know you read a typical story, and it's all right here.

241
00:18:14,612 --> 00:18:15,174
Speaker 1: We go.

242
00:18:15,475 --> 00:18:19,740
Speaker 1: There's gonna be this up now There's gonna be the build-up to that and then there's gonna be the action later.

243
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:27,230
Speaker 1: But it steps it up right away, and then it steps it up again right away And you get right into the thick of it, and then it's done.

244
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I sort of figured out.

245
00:18:29,881 --> 00:18:32,349
Speaker 0: It's one of those ones where you can figure out.

246
00:18:32,389 --> 00:18:42,480
Speaker 1: you know the who done it sort of like three corners obvious right away What's going on at least everything, but the the the twist how are they gonna get away with it at the end?

247
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:52,197
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's sort of like I figured most of it out about three-quarters of the way through But then like a couple pages before you know the real ending.

248
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:53,060
Speaker 0: I figured that out.

249
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:56,798
Speaker 0: So it was like ah there's a. there was a second thing that sort of you know catches you.

250
00:18:57,281 --> 00:19:00,560
Speaker 1: There's really only one problem with this comic what?

251
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:06,939
Speaker 1: it's a very central plot element and It's not as bad as the newest.

252
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:13,465
Speaker 1: well not the newest, but the second newest Batman movie where Microwaves kill everybody in the city or wait.

253
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,449
Speaker 1: No they just make steam.

254
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:24,035
Speaker 1: but in this comic the McGuffin as it were is Ludicrously just dumb like it's the dumbest thing.

255
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,457
Speaker 0: yeah, it's.

256
00:19:25,537 --> 00:19:32,011
Speaker 0: I'm glad though that it doesn't play Like the McGuffin itself like even though it's there the McGuffin You know.

257
00:19:32,293 --> 00:19:35,450
Speaker 0: it doesn't play that much of a role like you know It's.

258
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:40,450
Speaker 0: it's only discussed very a little bit and then a little bit at the end and mostly they could have made a better McGuffin.

259
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,780
Speaker 0: I they definitely could have made a better McGuffin, but it was.

260
00:19:43,161 --> 00:19:51,369
Speaker 0: it was mostly about you know the characters And you know who was you know killed all these people in such as opposed to you know?

261
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:54,080
Speaker 0: Why the why was sort of just there?

262
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,690
Speaker 0: because they needed a reason for the killings to happen?

263
00:19:57,071 --> 00:20:02,010
Speaker 1: But let's talk about the characters a little bit because there's really three kind of main primary characters.

264
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:07,250
Speaker 1: There's the domain character the cop and I like her because she's very non-stereotypical.

265
00:20:08,471 --> 00:20:10,116
Speaker 0: Yeah, her name's Carrie right.

266
00:20:10,136 --> 00:20:14,730
Speaker 1: She's a US marshal okay, and then there's the other girl who she works with.

267
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:17,148
Speaker 0: She's like the secret agent from the UK.

268
00:20:18,293 --> 00:20:20,890
Speaker 1: What you I believe you mean Albion right right?

269
00:20:21,310 --> 00:20:23,580
Speaker 1: And then there's the doctor who is one of those like.

270
00:20:23,821 --> 00:20:26,814
Speaker 1: he's the salty sea dog of the South Arctic And he's just.

271
00:20:27,256 --> 00:20:31,515
Speaker 1: he's like the best friend in the Arctic of the main character And he's just like this cool doctor guy.

272
00:20:32,077 --> 00:20:34,626
Speaker 1: and the three of them are pretty much the characters.

273
00:20:34,726 --> 00:20:37,962
Speaker 1: everyone else is either Villain or side character.

274
00:20:38,204 --> 00:20:39,310
Speaker 0: yep pretty much, okay?

275
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:48,708
Speaker 0: So there is a second volume of whiteout and sort of what it is is Greg Rucka and Steve Lieber said hey We actually have an opportunity to work together again.

276
00:20:49,352 --> 00:20:50,576
Speaker 0: Whiteout was awesome.

277
00:20:51,038 --> 00:20:51,821
Speaker 0: Can we do it again?

278
00:20:51,841 --> 00:20:52,845
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

279
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:59,474
Speaker 0: We can do it again and Basically what they do is they don't tell you know a Murder mystery story.

280
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:06,712
Speaker 0: they tell a different kind of story much in the same fashion, but also in Antarctica.

281
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:07,796
Speaker 1: I know that you're not saying.

282
00:21:07,836 --> 00:21:09,763
Speaker 1: what kind of story is that kind of a spoiler?

283
00:21:09,823 --> 00:21:15,008
Speaker 1: is it something where you really have to Read it to see Cuz I forget.

284
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,941
Speaker 0: But yeah, and I'm not that good at remembering.

285
00:21:20,162 --> 00:21:22,570
Speaker 0: You know things like that especially in two seconds.

286
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:23,936
Speaker 1: But didn't you just read it?

287
00:21:24,217 --> 00:21:25,643
Speaker 1: How do you read a comic?

288
00:21:25,663 --> 00:21:27,390
Speaker 1: and then I remember that's like saying yeah?

289
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:29,276
Speaker 1: I read this comic called Superman.

290
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:30,119
Speaker 1: What's it about?

291
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:34,870
Speaker 0: fuck if I know I read it like a couple weeks ago My brain started not doing so well.

292
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,337
Speaker 0: but anyway, it's It's basically it's just if you like to whiteout.

293
00:21:40,357 --> 00:21:49,460
Speaker 0: you'll probably like whiteout - but it for some like when I read it It just felt like slightly less Enjoyable than whiteout one, but I don't really.

294
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,143
Speaker 0: you know.

295
00:21:50,404 --> 00:21:52,571
Speaker 0: I could really put my finger on exactly Why.

296
00:21:52,632 --> 00:21:55,622
Speaker 0: maybe it's because I already you know knew the characters and sort of.

297
00:21:55,903 --> 00:21:57,930
Speaker 0: you know I was comfortable in the setting more so.

298
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:02,710
Speaker 0: So it was less exciting and new and fresh and maybe it seems like I mean the first comic.

299
00:22:02,991 --> 00:22:15,165
Speaker 1: whiteout was really good and I think part of the reason it was good is that it Ended and it was a solid story from start to finish and there was a lot there And especially with kind of the last few panels and the little like little subtle things.

300
00:22:15,245 --> 00:22:20,930
Speaker 1: I really like the last two pages But it's it's felt like it's one of those things where it's a setup.

301
00:22:21,275 --> 00:22:35,189
Speaker 1: It could keep going But I feel like it really would be better off if it just didn't keep going if it just was this one story because otherwise they'd either run out of stuff or They'd have to go in a completely different direction with it right away, or get old mm-hmm.

302
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:40,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically what they do is they just tell another self-contained story in an arc.

303
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:44,370
Speaker 0: And now you could actually probably read the second volume before you read the first one.

304
00:22:44,811 --> 00:22:48,524
Speaker 0: But it sort of makes some assumptions that you know about the characters a little bit.

305
00:22:48,684 --> 00:22:50,390
Speaker 1: it assumes that you know it's cold.

306
00:22:50,772 --> 00:22:52,644
Speaker 0: Yeah, well they all assume.

307
00:22:52,664 --> 00:22:53,470
Speaker 0: You know it's cold.

308
00:22:54,553 --> 00:22:57,330
Speaker 0: So yeah whiteout is definitely a high-quality comic.

309
00:22:57,731 --> 00:23:03,029
Speaker 0: I'm definitely putting Greg Rucka on my automatic buying list for anything that has his name on it.

310
00:23:03,711 --> 00:23:04,775
Speaker 0: It's from Oni.

311
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:07,966
Speaker 0: those are the people who published the Scott Pilgrim and this bill.

312
00:23:08,027 --> 00:23:12,713
Speaker 0: this volume is $14, but I can't imagine it's gonna be $14 in Amazon.

313
00:23:12,753 --> 00:23:13,894
Speaker 0: It's got to be less than that right.

314
00:23:20,419 --> 00:23:21,720
Speaker 1: so things of the day.

315
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:25,896
Speaker 1: What I have here is you know it's it's one thing to say all right.

316
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:26,940
Speaker 1: here's something crazy.

317
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:33,020
Speaker 1: Here's something just wacky and out there because it's the days of the internet and YouTube or if you want to see something weird.

318
00:23:33,442 --> 00:23:41,018
Speaker 1: There is enough weird stuff out there to keep you say - but every now and then Something kind of goes beyond just a little bit now.

319
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:51,259
Speaker 1: We're here We're talking to Hal Cali on Friday, but of all their music videos You should probably see this one because you think oh, it's just gonna be weird and zany.

320
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:54,007
Speaker 1: right It's really weird.

321
00:23:54,369 --> 00:23:55,534
Speaker 0: is this a twinkle star one.

322
00:23:55,674 --> 00:23:57,007
Speaker 1: Yes twinkle star Yeah.

323
00:23:57,322 --> 00:24:06,406
Speaker 0: I watched a bunch of their music videos But this song of all their songs that I want that to listen to is like stuck in my head like doo doo doo Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

324
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:08,440
Speaker 1: I don't know I really like all gaku no sushi.

325
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,164
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

326
00:24:09,466 --> 00:24:10,090
Speaker 0: I don't think I watch.

327
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:10,834
Speaker 0: I listen to that one.

328
00:24:10,995 --> 00:24:18,919
Speaker 0: I like that one a lot Yeah, but the twinkle star song is totally in my head and the music video is totally wacky And Doesn't quite do it.

329
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:23,340
Speaker 1: I think the moment I lost is when that cow comes in the cow just the slow.

330
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:26,899
Speaker 0: So the fighting the Fox turning into a cat and the gorilla with the boombox.

331
00:24:27,402 --> 00:24:37,120
Speaker 1: I just the fact that despite all the craziness you get honey get used to it And then there's the cow slow pan and it's one thing to just put a cow in a music video.

332
00:24:37,522 --> 00:24:40,939
Speaker 1: It's another thing to put a slow pan of a cow in a music video.

333
00:24:41,583 --> 00:24:42,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is.

334
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:48,960
Speaker 0: You should watch at least this and then Thank You Japan, maybe you'll decide if you like these people or not.

335
00:24:49,141 --> 00:24:52,860
Speaker 1: I'll probably link to the other music video too because I actually like that one in a non-ironic way.

336
00:24:53,301 --> 00:24:56,653
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like that like I actually do like the song with the.

337
00:24:56,674 --> 00:24:57,276
Speaker 1: I like the song.

338
00:24:57,296 --> 00:24:58,460
Speaker 0: the music videos is wacky.

339
00:24:58,821 --> 00:25:01,351
Speaker 1: Of course, all the music videos are a little wacky at least.

340
00:25:01,572 --> 00:25:03,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta ask them why their music videos?

341
00:25:03,621 --> 00:25:04,745
Speaker 1: I think that's the first question.

342
00:25:04,785 --> 00:25:05,488
Speaker 1: I'm gonna ask him.

343
00:25:05,568 --> 00:25:06,251
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

344
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:10,480
Speaker 0: All right, so I Had a hard time finding a thing of the day, but check this out.

345
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:22,154
Speaker 0: I found this webcomic right and it seems like he's about to do like a whole bunch of strips that are related Right, and this is like the strip that's starting off this little storyline and the story is right.

346
00:25:23,176 --> 00:25:45,540
Speaker 0: all of the public domain Characters that Disney is used over time such as Snow White the hunchback little mermaid etc, etc, right are all hanging out in like public domain forest or whatever and They're going to the Mickey's castle to get Mickey to join them because he his copyright is up.

347
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:45,942
Speaker 0: But it's.

348
00:25:46,042 --> 00:25:48,653
Speaker 0: but it's not because you know the law extended it.

349
00:25:49,537 --> 00:25:50,822
Speaker 0: It's pretty funny Uh-huh.

350
00:25:51,404 --> 00:26:01,540
Speaker 0: I want to see where he goes with this and I think I think it's gonna be good stuff because he's got the nice Copyright commentary, but he's also got the nice, you know jokes about all these characters.

351
00:26:02,264 --> 00:26:02,867
Speaker 0: It's good stuff.

352
00:26:03,632 --> 00:26:04,939
Speaker 0: All right, nice simple thing of the day.

353
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:09,833
Speaker 1: So it's rare that we find an anime that is new or not new.

354
00:26:09,973 --> 00:26:12,340
Speaker 1: ish at least that we both immediately like.

355
00:26:12,863 --> 00:26:14,700
Speaker 0: Well, it helps that you know, it's nice.

356
00:26:14,801 --> 00:26:18,000
Speaker 0: It's one of those shows where all the episodes are like five minutes long.

357
00:26:18,341 --> 00:26:19,809
Speaker 0: So our attention spans.

358
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:20,754
Speaker 0: we can actually watch it.

359
00:26:20,794 --> 00:26:21,879
Speaker 0: how almost all of it.

360
00:26:22,301 --> 00:26:25,994
Speaker 1: So basically our anime tastes are getting to the point to where we're basically children.

361
00:26:26,014 --> 00:26:27,540
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, there's a whole genre.

362
00:26:27,942 --> 00:26:31,780
Speaker 0: I don't know if the US doesn't really have an equivalent for this, but there's a whole genre of anime.

363
00:26:31,981 --> 00:26:39,308
Speaker 0: I don't even know if it's a genre but a whole set of anime shows where the episodes are really short like Risky safety.

364
00:26:39,469 --> 00:26:40,640
Speaker 0: All the episodes are really short.

365
00:26:42,422 --> 00:26:43,751
Speaker 0: He pots and he moves to me.

366
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:45,000
Speaker 0: all the episodes are like.

367
00:26:46,043 --> 00:26:47,779
Speaker 1: I think we've talked about that show.

368
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,162
Speaker 1: Yeah,

369
00:26:48,463 --> 00:27:04,596
Speaker 0: but you know, I don't know when these things air in Japan But I imagine they must have some like television spot that like these things can go in You know whereas in America if you want to see like a short cartoon thing like that You'll find it maybe is like part of a Sesame Street or something like that.

370
00:27:04,716 --> 00:27:09,400
Speaker 0: or you know I get think like what itchy and scratchy would be if it was, you know real, you know.

371
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:11,710
Speaker 0: Or if there was actually like a bows of the cloud.

372
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,324
Speaker 0: and he showed you like one Tom and Jerry cartoon But I bring up bows of the clown.

373
00:27:15,364 --> 00:27:22,499
Speaker 0: He was a frightening human being it was but even like one Tom and Jerry cartoon is almost Longer than one of these, you know.

374
00:27:23,661 --> 00:27:24,344
Speaker 1: Case in point.

375
00:27:24,705 --> 00:27:30,446
Speaker 1: I remember a day back in the anime club at RIT where we chose to Marathon risky safety.

376
00:27:30,586 --> 00:27:44,080
Speaker 1: and the thing is there was always this debate and if you've ever been in an anime club You always have these debates, you know, sob or dub Robots or shoujo, you know all the different but one of them was always do you show the opener and closer to an anime?

377
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:45,604
Speaker 1: Every episode.

378
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:52,144
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're gonna watch if you're gonna show the anime club right four episodes of Try gun, right?

379
00:27:52,646 --> 00:27:54,212
Speaker 0: You get the opener and close.

380
00:27:54,232 --> 00:27:55,015
Speaker 0: They're pretty cool.

381
00:27:55,055 --> 00:28:00,979
Speaker 0: They're good openers and closes I'm not gonna deny and you should definitely show the opener at least once in the closer at least once.

382
00:28:01,683 --> 00:28:04,820
Speaker 0: But should you skip them in between the episodes now?

383
00:28:05,201 --> 00:28:07,100
Speaker 1: It's you might think this is just a simple argument.

384
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,950
Speaker 0: Or should you watch the order four times in the closer four times?

385
00:28:10,071 --> 00:28:11,596
Speaker 1: fan subbers would cater to this.

386
00:28:11,636 --> 00:28:11,817
Speaker 1: to where?

387
00:28:11,837 --> 00:28:18,262
Speaker 1: if you're watching fan Subs like any good fan sub the first time you watch the opener you get the translation Subtitles.

388
00:28:18,723 --> 00:28:21,991
Speaker 1: the second episode has the romaji subtitles.

389
00:28:22,332 --> 00:28:29,793
Speaker 1: the third episode will have oftentimes either no subtitles No, the clean opener or they'll have just the Japanese subtitles.

390
00:28:29,873 --> 00:28:31,840
Speaker 1: And then if they do that the fourth will have the clean opener.

391
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:38,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of them will like alternate or you know between the two or three different You know kinds of subtitles.

392
00:28:38,026 --> 00:28:41,040
Speaker 0: some of them will put like one at the top one at the bottom and karaoke it.

393
00:28:41,583 --> 00:28:49,480
Speaker 0: But you know, it's this big debate and you know What we tended to do is for watching a four episodes of a new show We would you know show all the openers and closers

394
00:28:49,762 --> 00:28:56,840
Speaker 1: Actually works really well because they gave you a three minute kind of Intermission between each episode where people would talk or run out and get a drink or go to the bath

395
00:28:56,921 --> 00:28:58,959
Speaker 0: And also some shows, you know mixed it up.

396
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,051
Speaker 0: It actually had slight differences during the openers and closers.

397
00:29:02,633 --> 00:29:04,720
Speaker 0: the opener and closer wouldn't be the same for every episode.

398
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:09,280
Speaker 1: That's always except for the try gun release in the US where they must have missed that when they were bringing it over.

399
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:13,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, they took the opener from the first episode and just used it on all the DVDs.

400
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:18,457
Speaker 0: But the actual try gun opener does change every episode in the Japanese release, but not in the US.

401
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:22,708
Speaker 1: Yeah lonely a little bit It's not a big deal Rocky one.

402
00:29:22,728 --> 00:29:27,732
Speaker 1: You got to watch every opening Except they change like two seconds of.

403
00:29:27,832 --> 00:29:29,319
Speaker 0: I know they're such assholes.

404
00:29:29,841 --> 00:29:35,255
Speaker 0: Anyway, when you're watching a show where the actual show itself is like less than five minutes long.

405
00:29:35,917 --> 00:29:36,960
Speaker 0: How do you justify?

406
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:45,242
Speaker 0: Watching like three minutes of opener and closer for each episode that there's more opener and closer than there is episode Now?

407
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:48,920
Speaker 1: that was the anime club policy to show the openers and closers.

408
00:29:48,940 --> 00:30:00,325
Speaker 1: So we swear show in risky safety and after you know Five or so episodes people are getting a little antsy because there's almost more open or closer than there is show Especially with the previews.

409
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:05,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're watching the preview for the next time on the five minutes of risky safety.

410
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:05,783
Speaker 0: You're gonna watch.

411
00:30:05,963 --> 00:30:08,934
Speaker 1: but the thing is we asked the club like should we skip it?

412
00:30:09,175 --> 00:30:11,427
Speaker 1: and some people yelled hell Yes, good God.

413
00:30:11,689 --> 00:30:15,307
Speaker 1: and other people were like no No, we want to see it.

414
00:30:15,588 --> 00:30:19,080
Speaker 1: and it turned into this thing where people started yelling stuff out during the opener.

415
00:30:19,361 --> 00:30:22,495
Speaker 1: Okay, it was like this mini cult meme for one night and then it died.

416
00:30:22,535 --> 00:30:23,680
Speaker 1: and that was the end of that.

417
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:26,071
Speaker 0: Yeah, by the way the show we're talking about today.

418
00:30:26,091 --> 00:30:28,783
Speaker 1: I'm echo dobutsu Dameko.

419
00:30:28,863 --> 00:30:30,488
Speaker 0: dobutsu is a Trent.

420
00:30:30,588 --> 00:30:31,631
Speaker 0: Emily taught me what it means.

421
00:30:31,691 --> 00:30:34,239
Speaker 0: Dameko is like, you know, Dom a it's like.

422
00:30:35,244 --> 00:30:37,556
Speaker 0: It's basically means useless like no no good.

423
00:30:37,576 --> 00:30:40,347
Speaker 0: and then Dovitsu is animals.

424
00:30:40,548 --> 00:30:42,398
Speaker 0: So the show is the useless animals.

425
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:42,700
Speaker 0: I like.

426
00:30:43,765 --> 00:30:46,699
Speaker 0: I like to call it the animals that suck because this show.

427
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:52,380
Speaker 1: maybe I should read the Description that I've got in front of me here because it serves it best.

428
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:58,280
Speaker 1: All right, each of these animals does not live up to the expectations and standards of his or her species.

429
00:30:58,662 --> 00:31:01,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much have a wolf that is not ferocious.

430
00:31:02,042 --> 00:31:05,492
Speaker 0: You have a unicorn that drinks sake and is womanizing.

431
00:31:05,632 --> 00:31:08,240
Speaker 1: you have a cheetah who can't run and trips over.

432
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,720
Speaker 0: You got a near-sighted eagle.

433
00:31:12,242 --> 00:31:13,185
Speaker 1: Who's an asshole?

434
00:31:13,266 --> 00:31:15,636
Speaker 1: I love the rabbit cuz he's like the rabbit.

435
00:31:15,716 --> 00:31:16,640
Speaker 1: don't you make fun of me?

436
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:21,639
Speaker 1: I have all the traits common to my species solitary and untrusted.

437
00:31:22,721 --> 00:31:25,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, that rabbit really reminds me of that.

438
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:26,374
Speaker 0: that Cromartie High School.

439
00:31:26,394 --> 00:31:38,203
Speaker 0: That's another short show Cromartie That Cromartie High School thing where it's like mmm if a rabbit is in a lion's den and it's not dead That's some fucking rabbit You know.

440
00:31:38,223 --> 00:31:41,900
Speaker 0: and that this rabbit is totally that because it kicks all the other animals asses.

441
00:31:42,642 --> 00:31:45,269
Speaker 1: But this is a show that was it's based on.

442
00:31:45,289 --> 00:31:55,534
Speaker 1: there was a comic series from manga life back in like 2001 written by Noriko kawara and it's Basically just five minutes of these animals failing at life.

443
00:31:55,594 --> 00:31:57,400
Speaker 1: now what makes it interesting?

444
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,247
Speaker 1: I mean, this is a kid a kid show.

445
00:31:59,327 --> 00:32:01,074
Speaker 1: It's on kids station.

446
00:32:01,596 --> 00:32:02,299
Speaker 1: It's a kids show.

447
00:32:03,062 --> 00:32:05,227
Speaker 1: But the animals they're not just animals.

448
00:32:05,267 --> 00:32:08,976
Speaker 1: it's not like a cute anime animal rabbit who fights with the wolf or whatever.

449
00:32:09,558 --> 00:32:15,517
Speaker 1: they're basically adults in Like animal suits living in the woods.

450
00:32:15,658 --> 00:32:23,420
Speaker 1: Yeah There's 21 year old guy in a wolf suit and the rabbit is this 26 year old dude wearing a rabbit suit.

451
00:32:23,661 --> 00:32:27,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not it's it's sort of furry in that way.

452
00:32:27,431 --> 00:32:30,620
Speaker 0: But really if you watch the show you'll realize it's not a furry.

453
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:34,111
Speaker 0: It's a cute comedy that just happens to have furry visuals.

454
00:32:34,533 --> 00:32:34,834
Speaker 1: I don't know.

455
00:32:34,874 --> 00:32:36,600
Speaker 1: you seem to like what's-her-name the panther girl.

456
00:32:37,041 --> 00:32:38,185
Speaker 0: Oh panther girls hot yo.

457
00:32:38,305 --> 00:32:39,328
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

458
00:32:39,348 --> 00:32:42,157
Speaker 1: I like her a lot, but I also like the.

459
00:32:42,297 --> 00:32:43,240
Speaker 1: oh, you know what?

460
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,293
Speaker 1: I think all the members of the female feline club win.

461
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:50,286
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, they're all they're all good But the panther girls the best.

462
00:32:50,506 --> 00:33:05,436
Speaker 1: but the show opens with the panther girl reminds me a lot of the the nuts the the serious teacher from Azumanga dive Ah But I don't know is a wolf who sucks and he's traveling with a bindle and he's hungry.

463
00:33:05,457 --> 00:33:07,263
Speaker 1: and he sees a rabbit and thinks Huh?

464
00:33:07,625 --> 00:33:08,830
Speaker 1: Pray good God.

465
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:11,020
Speaker 1: and he goes to try to eat the rabbit and the rabbit kick his ass.

466
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,969
Speaker 1: Rabbit's name was Sahara rabbits a jerk.

467
00:33:14,491 --> 00:33:20,420
Speaker 1: and then from there we meet the rest of these people And they just I don't think I can express to you how much they suck.

468
00:33:20,801 --> 00:33:23,570
Speaker 0: They pretty much suck at everything and it's basically every.

469
00:33:23,971 --> 00:33:25,817
Speaker 0: the wolf was looking for a new home.

470
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,720
Speaker 0: You know, he's got a bindle.

471
00:33:26,781 --> 00:33:27,467
Speaker 0: he's on the road.

472
00:33:27,487 --> 00:33:35,286
Speaker 0: he doesn't have a place to live and he wasn't gonna live in this forest with the shitty rabbit that he hated and then that the Cheetah girl came along.

473
00:33:35,367 --> 00:33:36,794
Speaker 0: he go or leopard.

474
00:33:36,835 --> 00:33:37,257
Speaker 0: Yeah cheetah.

475
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:39,953
Speaker 0: She's a cheater Yeah, she's.

476
00:33:42,862 --> 00:33:45,714
Speaker 0: Then he falls in love with the clumsy cheetah at first sight.

477
00:33:45,734 --> 00:33:47,180
Speaker 0: so he decides to live in this forest.

478
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:50,780
Speaker 0: But every animal in the forest is no good at what they're supposed to be good at.

479
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:52,727
Speaker 0: You got a whale who can't swim.

480
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:54,011
Speaker 1: the whale has floaties.

481
00:33:54,352 --> 00:33:56,580
Speaker 0: the whale has a floaty and it can't swim.

482
00:33:57,284 --> 00:34:06,760
Speaker 1: I think my bet the favorite name of all these people those Pegonoscale yeah The shy Pegasus shy emo super depressed Pegasus.

483
00:34:08,288 --> 00:34:11,268
Speaker 1: Good God He's so great.

484
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,239
Speaker 0: I figured the unicorn would be your guy though.

485
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:20,000
Speaker 1: See, I'd really like the unicorn too because he there's really nothing wrong with him except that he's just an asshole.

486
00:34:20,139 --> 00:34:22,550
Speaker 1: He lives in the woods, but like kind of by himself.

487
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:24,860
Speaker 0: I think the unicorn is the character closest to rim.

488
00:34:26,109 --> 00:34:26,699
Speaker 1: Well, he is a woman.

489
00:34:29,223 --> 00:34:29,705
Speaker 0: Is the woman?

490
00:34:29,804 --> 00:34:33,540
Speaker 0: I think long-haired be shown in unicorns who drink sake all the time.

491
00:34:34,123 --> 00:34:44,906
Speaker 1: But is he's mad lazy I think I mean what works is that you uni Hiko the unicorn and usa Hara the rabbit are both jerks But they're jerks in different ways.

492
00:34:44,947 --> 00:34:48,340
Speaker 1: the rabbit beats people up and the unicorn just messes with people.

493
00:34:48,712 --> 00:34:51,812
Speaker 1: Yeah And the two of them usually well like.

494
00:34:51,831 --> 00:35:00,060
Speaker 1: there's one good episode where the two of them are kind of Hanging out watching the wolf just suck and they're basically just getting drunk and talking about how much he sucks while he's sucking.

495
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:04,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, my favorite part with the unicorn and the rabbit is the rabbit.

496
00:35:04,861 --> 00:35:09,922
Speaker 0: You know the unicorn goes up to the wolf and he's like, you know, he's like, okay the unicorn just met the wolf Right.

497
00:35:09,942 --> 00:35:10,506
Speaker 0: It was a horror.

498
00:35:10,526 --> 00:35:12,498
Speaker 0: and he says, you know, tell me I will.

499
00:35:12,518 --> 00:35:13,964
Speaker 0: he's like I will listen to your wish.

500
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:17,900
Speaker 0: and the wolf is like, oh man the you the magically unicorns gonna grant me my wish.

501
00:35:18,221 --> 00:35:22,720
Speaker 0: So he's like, you know, I wish you know as he wishes for like Chico right or something like that.

502
00:35:23,182 --> 00:35:24,310
Speaker 1: I forget what he wishes for.

503
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:25,740
Speaker 1: I don't want to be a coward.

504
00:35:25,901 --> 00:35:27,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, he wants courage because that's what he sucks at.

505
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:28,014
Speaker 0: He's.

506
00:35:28,034 --> 00:35:29,831
Speaker 0: he's not a courageous wolf he's a cowardly wolf.

507
00:35:30,398 --> 00:35:35,176
Speaker 0: and The unicorn is like well try hard someday and you'll you'll get there.

508
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:39,819
Speaker 0: and the wolf is like Oh, you really were just listening and not granting you ass.

509
00:35:40,682 --> 00:35:45,556
Speaker 0: So then he's done the unicorn as the rabbit what his wishes and the rabbits like her.

510
00:35:45,837 --> 00:35:46,880
Speaker 0: and he's like I want your horn.

511
00:35:47,261 --> 00:35:48,787
Speaker 0: He's like what do you want my horn for?

512
00:35:48,827 --> 00:35:49,530
Speaker 0: and the rabbits like.

513
00:35:49,811 --> 00:35:51,256
Speaker 0: my mom is sick in your horn.

514
00:35:51,517 --> 00:35:53,786
Speaker 0: if I grind it up I can make medicine for my mom.

515
00:35:53,827 --> 00:35:55,434
Speaker 1: now then the best part.

516
00:35:55,654 --> 00:35:56,920
Speaker 1: He pulls out this other horn.

517
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:57,322
Speaker 1: He's like.

518
00:35:57,482 --> 00:35:59,932
Speaker 0: he pulls out this horn and he tries to give it to the rabbit.

519
00:35:59,972 --> 00:36:02,020
Speaker 0: He's like, oh here I have something for you.

520
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:03,484
Speaker 0: He's like really.

521
00:36:03,504 --> 00:36:04,066
Speaker 0: he's like.

522
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:08,740
Speaker 1: this is the horn of my former lover who died blah blah blah tragedy.

523
00:36:09,621 --> 00:36:13,537
Speaker 1: You can have it, but it's still a little cursed if you're okay with that.

524
00:36:14,863 --> 00:36:20,591
Speaker 0: And the rabbits like no, I don't like a cursed horn, but then he's like, I thought this is a spare horn It's just my spare horn.

525
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,700
Speaker 1: the first one fell off asshole.

526
00:36:24,683 --> 00:36:27,120
Speaker 0: But yeah, it shows funny like that.

527
00:36:27,120 --> 00:36:29,487
Speaker 1: I think Scott's favorite character still Takaoka the eagle.

528
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:33,620
Speaker 0: the eagle who can't who has you know bad vision is the best is my.

529
00:36:34,062 --> 00:36:40,508
Speaker 0: You know, I guess I don't like him in the way that I like the the panther girl But he provides me the most humor.

530
00:36:40,528 --> 00:36:41,852
Speaker 0: cuz like, you know, he's.

531
00:36:41,872 --> 00:36:46,620
Speaker 0: he's not stupid and he's just sort of normal But the only thing he sucks at is near-sightedness.

532
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:50,299
Speaker 0: Otherwise, he's just sort of hanging out being cool being an eagle, you know.

533
00:36:50,822 --> 00:36:58,378
Speaker 0: but like he'll dive into the water like he's gonna get a fish and he'll be good at diving and He'll go into the water to come up with a straw man.

534
00:37:00,242 --> 00:37:02,839
Speaker 1: We got to make an animated gif of that straw man for the forum.

535
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,549
Speaker 0: We do have to use that for the book.

536
00:37:04,629 --> 00:37:06,600
Speaker 1: Let's don't forget the bear of sub siblings.

537
00:37:06,961 --> 00:37:08,849
Speaker 0: Well, but they're from another town so they don't suck.

538
00:37:08,989 --> 00:37:12,664
Speaker 1: I know but it's great cuz I come on a I love her.

539
00:37:12,684 --> 00:37:16,240
Speaker 1: when she shows up cuz her and the rabbit bond through muscles and fighting.

540
00:37:17,942 --> 00:37:23,152
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the eagle like whenever something's going on It's like he knows like a smart thing to do like he.

541
00:37:23,172 --> 00:37:26,709
Speaker 0: so he's sort of like hey, you know wolf Let's team up on that rabbit and we can get him.

542
00:37:26,829 --> 00:37:29,040
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you know, that's sort of like the smart good idea.

543
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:30,568
Speaker 0: It's just you know, he's near-sighted.

544
00:37:30,588 --> 00:37:31,653
Speaker 0: So it does doesn't work.

545
00:37:31,673 --> 00:37:34,123
Speaker 1: I Mean, I don't know what else we can say.

546
00:37:34,164 --> 00:37:42,230
Speaker 1: if you like a light-hearted cute fairly clever really short show I've you got 26 episodes of five minutes each.

547
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:45,743
Speaker 0: you could watch this whole thing in a couple hours and you'll be done with it Forever.

548
00:37:45,884 --> 00:37:49,968
Speaker 0: Well unless you want to watch it again because it's cute now You probably will be because we end up.

549
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,640
Speaker 1: I keep watching the episodes again and again as we show them to people.

550
00:37:52,761 --> 00:37:55,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is on the crunchyroll so you can watch it there.

551
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,109
Speaker 0: There's also a torrent.

552
00:37:56,391 --> 00:38:00,675
Speaker 0: if you can help me out with that I think it's still going on my computer and a lot of it's on the YouTube.

553
00:38:00,715 --> 00:38:08,800
Speaker 1: so you can just get it there though Watch out because after a few episodes, the only thing left on YouTube are Russian subtitles or Spanish subtitles.

554
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,693
Speaker 0: Yeah Crunchyroll has the the, you know, fully English subtitles.

555
00:38:12,734 --> 00:38:18,880
Speaker 1: as much as I dislike everything The crunchyroll is stands for and ever will be they do have the episodes available for watching.

556
00:38:19,001 --> 00:38:23,486
Speaker 1: So yeah, but I mean I guess if you like Ozumaga Daioh You'd probably like this show.

557
00:38:23,506 --> 00:38:25,575
Speaker 0: if you like risky safety apply like the show.

558
00:38:25,595 --> 00:38:27,684
Speaker 1: if you're human I mean, it's.

559
00:38:28,005 --> 00:38:28,608
Speaker 1: it's not like.

560
00:38:28,648 --> 00:38:29,472
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna pretend.

561
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:31,139
Speaker 1: I mean we might be talking like this is not?

562
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:33,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is not like high art.

563
00:38:33,087 --> 00:38:36,120
Speaker 0: This is not like a Kira Miyazaki level anime.

564
00:38:36,820 --> 00:38:42,200
Speaker 0: This is not the best anime in the world, but it's a cute funny show with good characters.

565
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:43,348
Speaker 1: It is really cute.

566
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,039
Speaker 1: And I think it's really funny.

567
00:38:45,642 --> 00:38:54,720
Speaker 0: I think of another thing that really makes it funny and cute is in most shows Characters are drawn like seriously and then when something silly happens the characters will.

568
00:38:54,781 --> 00:38:55,720
Speaker 1: That's the best thing.

569
00:38:56,362 --> 00:39:00,880
Speaker 0: The characters will super deform, you know, it's like, you know, you're watching slayers and everyone looks normal.

570
00:39:01,041 --> 00:39:03,120
Speaker 0: And then you know Leon inverse gets hit over the head.

571
00:39:04,502 --> 00:39:05,907
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the best scene in all the slaves.

572
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,154
Speaker 0: yeah, then she's all super deformed with the koala action.

573
00:39:08,857 --> 00:39:15,199
Speaker 0: but in this show Everyone is super deformed or at least relatively super deformed all the time because it's cute animal show.

574
00:39:15,942 --> 00:39:19,616
Speaker 0: But then what'll happen is they'll un-super deformed.

575
00:39:19,676 --> 00:39:20,660
Speaker 1: They'll like be shownify.

576
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:28,400
Speaker 0: Yeah They're like they'll get all serious and be shown in or like all pretty and girly Suddenly like they'll zoom in and their faces won't just be circles.

577
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:39,160
Speaker 0: their faces will actually be like sort of serious anime faces and they'd be like, oh It's just it's a good change of pace is what I would say.

578
00:39:39,501 --> 00:39:41,327
Speaker 1: I'd recommend anyone who's an anime fan.

579
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:42,812
Speaker 1: You have nothing to lose.

580
00:39:43,153 --> 00:39:45,300
Speaker 1: It's five minutes long.

581
00:39:45,601 --> 00:39:56,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I was an anime club what I would do is I would sort of show these maybe like, you know One or two per you know, anime club meeting like maybe one at the beginning and then maybe one like oh

582
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:57,666
Speaker 1: I know what exactly what I do

583
00:39:57,767 --> 00:40:00,400
Speaker 0: in the middle of the showing - it sort of cleanses the anime pallet

584
00:40:01,201 --> 00:40:07,800
Speaker 1: Music videos, I'd probably show one episode of this every, you know every week or every whatever the anime club meets.

585
00:40:07,982 --> 00:40:08,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a good one.

586
00:40:08,972 --> 00:40:09,962
Speaker 1: Just one episode It's.

587
00:40:10,042 --> 00:40:16,015
Speaker 0: it's a good way to cleanse the anime pallet especially if you just watch something bad like say his eyes and Jotaro or something.

588
00:40:16,055 --> 00:40:18,626
Speaker 0: then you can watch one of these and be like, ah, of course, we.

589
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:27,350
Speaker 1: we did that or we attempted to do something like that way back when Aruda came out and We showed everyone the first episode of that.

590
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:29,600
Speaker 1: they thought it was the hottest shit probably just cuz it was different.

591
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:32,679
Speaker 1: Whoa, did that go downhill?

592
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:42,265
Speaker 1: There have been shows that went downhill before but that show just not that it started very high to begin with but it went Like.

593
00:40:42,285 --> 00:40:43,660
Speaker 1: you wouldn't think it could get worse.

594
00:40:43,781 --> 00:40:50,194
Speaker 0: But I mean you did have crazy rocket launcher action But that wasn't enough to make up for the CG worse than a PlayStation video game.

595
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:56,153
Speaker 1: I Mean at least initial D had PlayStation 1 graphics early on.

596
00:40:56,273 --> 00:41:00,335
Speaker 0: I know and think about that initial D had better Animation and graphics than urda.

597
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:07,618
Speaker 1: Ah Anyway, all right, don't forget Friday this week six o'clock, you know Cooney in New York City.
