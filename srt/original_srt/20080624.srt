1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:09,480
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,781 --> 00:00:11,426
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, June 24th.

3
00:00:11,567 --> 00:00:12,590
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

4
00:00:12,771 --> 00:00:15,159
Speaker 1: I'm sky and this is geek night.

5
00:00:15,219 --> 00:00:16,886
Speaker 1: tonight We talk about the board game.

6
00:00:17,006 --> 00:00:19,636
Speaker 0: shadows over Camelot come a lot.

7
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:20,439
Speaker 1: It's only a model.

8
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:38,018
Speaker 1: Let's do this So before any you in the forum get on to some sort of flame war about this since you've been fighting about everything lately Mountain biking is a sport.

9
00:00:38,923 --> 00:00:47,359
Speaker 1: It is indeed and I bring it up only because if I talk about mountain biking I am sure beyond a shadow of a doubt that half you people are gonna make a whole thread about it.

10
00:00:47,581 --> 00:00:48,083
Speaker 1: It's not a sport.

11
00:00:48,123 --> 00:00:51,380
Speaker 1: bla bla bla direct competition bla even though yeah direct competition.

12
00:00:51,400 --> 00:01:00,124
Speaker 1: But anyway, I've been mountain biking and biking for most of my life pretty much forever and this summer I decided all right.

13
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:04,640
Speaker 1: I haven't been biking so much in the last few years, and I really want to get it back.

14
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:07,312
Speaker 1: Why don't I just go buy a brand new bike?

15
00:01:07,372 --> 00:01:09,100
Speaker 1: I'll buy like the best goddamn bike.

16
00:01:09,442 --> 00:01:12,297
Speaker 0: The best goddamn bike is a bajillion dollars.

17
00:01:12,317 --> 00:01:15,769
Speaker 1: you gotta buy Well the best goddamn bike.

18
00:01:16,009 --> 00:01:19,339
Speaker 1: that isn't a professional like cyclists bike.

19
00:01:19,419 --> 00:01:20,848
Speaker 1: because Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.

20
00:01:23,443 --> 00:01:26,273
Speaker 1: I don't need a bike that cost more than my car when I bought it new.

21
00:01:26,394 --> 00:01:27,197
Speaker 0: no you need like an $800 bike.

22
00:01:28,384 --> 00:01:33,020
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing some Back when I was riding bike technology was a lot different.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,392
Speaker 1: I mean we're talking 14 years ago when I got this bike.

24
00:01:36,814 --> 00:01:38,520
Speaker 1: this bike still works barely.

25
00:01:38,984 --> 00:01:44,855
Speaker 1: But I decided all right Maybe I'll get one of those full suspension bikes cuz I know there's pros and cons.

26
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:46,380
Speaker 1: back then it was mostly cons.

27
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,167
Speaker 1: They just sucked pretty much.

28
00:01:48,388 --> 00:01:50,276
Speaker 1: They bobble all the time when your roads.

29
00:01:50,317 --> 00:01:51,080
Speaker 1: They slowed you down.

30
00:01:51,401 --> 00:01:53,068
Speaker 1: They were a lot heavier than normal bikes.

31
00:01:53,088 --> 00:01:55,740
Speaker 1: all these problems, but now you know they should be pretty good.

32
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:02,028
Speaker 1: So I decided to go to a bike shop, and I walk in and I'm like yeah What's the best full suspension Schwinn you got?

33
00:02:02,068 --> 00:02:04,538
Speaker 1: he said don't care Schwinn hair yeah?

34
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:06,907
Speaker 1: I was like why the hell?

35
00:02:06,947 --> 00:02:11,288
Speaker 1: not she was like the best bike, and he's like yeah She went was the best bike a decade ago.

36
00:02:11,348 --> 00:02:12,654
Speaker 1: now she went sells in Walmart.

37
00:02:13,115 --> 00:02:22,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was like oh That's what I'm talking about like if you ever find the link again for that lawnmowers story There's a guy who made high-quality lawnmowers.

38
00:02:22,617 --> 00:02:26,060
Speaker 0: He'd lawn Walmart wanted to buy his lawnmowers to sell them in Walmart.

39
00:02:26,362 --> 00:02:29,076
Speaker 0: They said you're gonna have to reduce the quality so we can lower the price.

40
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:31,307
Speaker 0: He said hell no I'm gonna stay my high-quality ways.

41
00:02:31,729 --> 00:02:34,200
Speaker 0: Schwinn obviously did the opposite and said hell yes Walmart.

42
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,747
Speaker 1: Actually what it looks like Schwinn did is they didn't.

43
00:02:37,248 --> 00:02:42,703
Speaker 1: their their high-end bikes are still as high-end as they were before I guess Relatively.

44
00:02:42,743 --> 00:02:47,618
Speaker 1: they just introduced all these low-end bikes that have the shoe and logo stuck all over him.

45
00:02:47,779 --> 00:02:48,180
Speaker 0: It's weird.

46
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:57,551
Speaker 0: It's like when I was a kid bike brands were like Shrin and Huffy and now bike brands are well Ken Dale Shrek and Cannondale and specialized specialized.

47
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,336
Speaker 1: I don't know whatever I knew it's.

48
00:02:59,436 --> 00:03:00,940
Speaker 0: it's interesting though that there's such.

49
00:03:01,533 --> 00:03:05,498
Speaker 0: You know Competition and change in the bike, you know making industry.

50
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:05,920
Speaker 0: That's it.

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,589
Speaker 1: I mean little things like when I bought my bike way back.

52
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:18,677
Speaker 1: Well when my dad bought my bike, yeah Disc brakes were this crazy stupid thing that no one but idiots who were super rich had on their bikes.

53
00:03:18,757 --> 00:03:23,731
Speaker 1: pretty much now Pretty much any mountain bike worth of damn has disc brakes.

54
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:26,900
Speaker 1: Otherwise, it's almost useless and actually really dangerous.

55
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,688
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean well, I mean they weren't really dangerous.

56
00:03:29,708 --> 00:03:30,390
Speaker 0: yes they were.

57
00:03:30,451 --> 00:03:31,033
Speaker 0: they invented.

58
00:03:31,053 --> 00:03:31,675
Speaker 1: yes they were.

59
00:03:31,715 --> 00:03:32,979
Speaker 1: they were stupidly dangerous.

60
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:34,004
Speaker 1: people Just put up with it.

61
00:03:34,325 --> 00:03:34,546
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

62
00:03:34,606 --> 00:03:35,731
Speaker 1: Here's the deal linear.

63
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:36,856
Speaker 1: Well, there's a ball God.

64
00:03:36,876 --> 00:03:37,258
Speaker 1: I don't want to.

65
00:03:37,278 --> 00:03:37,820
Speaker 1: this is the bike show.

66
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,659
Speaker 1: But alright, I'll only talk about brakes.

67
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:45,560
Speaker 1: His linear pole is the horseshoe and well not a linear pole was the newest one of those kinds.

68
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:48,865
Speaker 1: There was the there's the horseshoe pole there was the side pole.

69
00:03:48,885 --> 00:03:58,546
Speaker 1: all these different kinds of brakes and the linear were pretty much the best but they still go on the rim and That makes them completely stop working if the rim gets wet or you go through mud.

70
00:03:58,867 --> 00:03:59,227
Speaker 1: Yep.

71
00:03:59,488 --> 00:04:01,250
Speaker 1: This breaks continue to work.

72
00:04:03,042 --> 00:04:03,706
Speaker 1: That's really key.

73
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:09,182
Speaker 0: when you you know, I don't know mountain biking I mean stuff could get in a little disc thingy But it's.

74
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:12,700
Speaker 1: it's a lot less likely and even when stuff gets in there it deals with it a lot.

75
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:16,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, plus the radius of the disc is much smaller than the radius of the rim.

76
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:20,375
Speaker 0: So it you know, it'll be quickly cleaned up.

77
00:04:20,397 --> 00:04:25,837
Speaker 1: the real key though Just in case anyone's curious why disc brakes are necessary just in case you wondered is well one.

78
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:33,552
Speaker 1: if you're biking You really should only be using your front brake and if you're using your rear brake all the time Then you never learn how to bike properly, but to buy.

79
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:45,313
Speaker 1: if you're going downhill with normal brakes They'll heat up and stop working kind of like if you're in a cheap car with old drum brakes or like crappy brakes And you're going downhill and kind of ride the brake the whole time instead of downshifting.

80
00:04:45,514 --> 00:04:46,477
Speaker 1: your brakes won't work.

81
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:53,160
Speaker 0: when you get to the bottom Yeah, and most on most bikes the brake is this piece of two pieces of rubber that gets squished up against the rim.

82
00:04:53,300 --> 00:05:01,479
Speaker 0: So if you just hold the brakes down and you're going really fast down a hill the wheel keeps spinning and spinning and spinning And you're just slowing down, but you're not stop

83
00:05:02,303 --> 00:05:03,317
Speaker 1: Keeps on turning

84
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:08,598
Speaker 0: Okay, and the pieces of rubber on the brake heat up from all the friction and they melt and they get.

85
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:10,705
Speaker 0: you know They don't they're not hard anymore.

86
00:05:10,725 --> 00:05:14,657
Speaker 1: They get not to mention the fact that my rooms haven't been straight for about six years.

87
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:19,290
Speaker 0: Yeah So they turn into liquid and you can't stop.

88
00:05:19,491 --> 00:05:22,926
Speaker 1: yep, but to skip all that it was like, alright I'm gonna go buy a brand new bike.

89
00:05:22,946 --> 00:05:25,256
Speaker 1: and I talked to this bike guy and I was pretty much like.

90
00:05:25,618 --> 00:05:29,532
Speaker 1: so I haven't Known anything new about bikes for a decade.

91
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:34,539
Speaker 1: He's like, ah, alright well, and he taught me all about what's going on now with bikes.

92
00:05:34,559 --> 00:05:44,400
Speaker 1: and Then I was like and I you know, I didn't even look at the prices I looked at the Schwinn's and a high-end hardtail Schwinn was under a thousand dollars like fully loaded.

93
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,048
Speaker 1: So I'm like, alright, this can't be that bad.

94
00:05:46,088 --> 00:05:47,093
Speaker 1: So I'm there and I'm looking.

95
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:48,560
Speaker 1: he's like well test ride this one.

96
00:05:48,841 --> 00:05:54,420
Speaker 1: This is pretty much the best full suspension bike we have and I rode it around and it was absolutely amazing.

97
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:58,420
Speaker 1: It was like night and day like riding the kind where there's like only half a fork in the front.

98
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,229
Speaker 1: Yeah lefty made out of carbon fiber.

99
00:06:01,269 --> 00:06:02,613
Speaker 1: the thing weighed so little.

100
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:04,620
Speaker 1: I could pick the whole bike up with two fingers.

101
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:07,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, like up up up and it was great.

102
00:06:07,634 --> 00:06:27,000
Speaker 1: and I rode it around the parking lot And I took it to some trails and I'm biking around and it was a transcendent experience though it was a little weird because the full suspension like it had this brain thing like an inertial damper that could tell if I Was putting the pressure on it Like if I was trying to jump and would lock the suspension, but it would unlock if the bumps came from the bottom.

103
00:06:27,182 --> 00:06:28,312
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, it worked.

104
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:29,100
Speaker 1: It was scary.

105
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,124
Speaker 1: How well it worked.

106
00:06:30,144 --> 00:06:32,092
Speaker 0: a lot of those things are kind of see.

107
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:35,423
Speaker 0: the thing is a lot of bikes where they have all The fancy features.

108
00:06:35,463 --> 00:06:39,956
Speaker 0: Yeah, they also have some gimmicky features to get rich people who don't know any better.

109
00:06:39,996 --> 00:06:48,658
Speaker 0: to case in point the automatic Transmission, yeah, well automatic transmission bikes have a purpose and a place but not Yeah, not on any bike.

110
00:06:49,161 --> 00:06:54,340
Speaker 0: No, if you're like a you know, lazy person doesn't bother switching gears going around the city.

111
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:58,160
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, lazy person city bike has an internal three-speed.

112
00:06:58,682 --> 00:07:03,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, not not an automatic transmission with a complicated mechanism.

113
00:07:03,722 --> 00:07:06,149
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, so I walk back in.

114
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:07,634
Speaker 1: I'm like man that bikes great.

115
00:07:07,975 --> 00:07:12,996
Speaker 1: I want it and he was like, alright Let me figure out how much it costs because it wasn't just like it what he couldn't.

116
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:13,980
Speaker 1: there's no sticker on it.

117
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,699
Speaker 1: he has to go figure out how much it caused based on what specific like model and make it was.

118
00:07:18,739 --> 00:07:20,484
Speaker 1: and He comes back.

119
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:29,854
Speaker 0: He's like, well, it's six thousand and I was like, alright, never mind, dude You know usually the craziest bike in the store is something like four thousand.

120
00:07:29,995 --> 00:07:30,637
Speaker 1: said I don't know.

121
00:07:30,657 --> 00:07:33,608
Speaker 1: if he had said like $2,000 I might have just bought it.

122
00:07:34,029 --> 00:07:35,214
Speaker 0: That's to air on chair.

123
00:07:35,274 --> 00:07:35,535
Speaker 1: Yes.

124
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:36,880
Speaker 1: That is a crazy amount of money.

125
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:41,760
Speaker 1: I might have regretted it, but I might have just bought it because that was in the realm of expectation.

126
00:07:42,081 --> 00:07:46,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, when he said six thousand and he wasn't done like.

127
00:07:46,476 --> 00:07:47,520
Speaker 0: I could buy a motorcycle.

128
00:07:48,181 --> 00:07:52,192
Speaker 0: Why would I buy a non motored cycle for motorcycle motorcycle?

129
00:07:52,452 --> 00:07:55,200
Speaker 1: I could buy three of my current car.

130
00:07:56,404 --> 00:07:58,540
Speaker 1: I could buy six air on chairs.

131
00:08:01,448 --> 00:08:06,524
Speaker 0: You could buy Three Eighteen probably twenty ps3.

132
00:08:07,367 --> 00:08:09,754
Speaker 1: You know what I could buy a hell of a lot of video games.

133
00:08:09,855 --> 00:08:10,958
Speaker 0: That sure is all good.

134
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:14,327
Speaker 1: So Instead I why said alright.

135
00:08:14,367 --> 00:08:17,720
Speaker 1: Well, I'll be back and I test wrote a whole but I spent the whole day there test riding bikes.

136
00:08:17,961 --> 00:08:19,005
Speaker 0: He was probably go home kid.

137
00:08:19,427 --> 00:08:22,359
Speaker 1: No, cuz he he pretty much was like, I'm gonna sell this guy bike.

138
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:24,845
Speaker 1: He didn't know he didn't.

139
00:08:25,046 --> 00:08:25,347
Speaker 1: not yet.

140
00:08:25,387 --> 00:08:25,809
Speaker 1: Not yet.

141
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,680
Speaker 1: But the thing is I did all this test riding.

142
00:08:29,061 --> 00:08:31,387
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bike store was rocking.

143
00:08:31,467 --> 00:08:36,500
Speaker 1: actually they have like eight salespeople and like all these other tags, it's a really good bike store.

144
00:08:37,342 --> 00:08:38,528
Speaker 0: One that's way out there by the airport.

145
00:08:38,648 --> 00:08:38,869
Speaker 0: Yeah.

146
00:08:38,909 --> 00:08:40,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's really the only good bike store.

147
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:43,893
Speaker 0: There's one that's closer that the wooden one with the old guy.

148
00:08:44,053 --> 00:08:45,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's the other one that went out of business.

149
00:08:45,741 --> 00:08:47,488
Speaker 0: That's the same one is the old one with the old guy.

150
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:52,249
Speaker 1: only it's a different branch and the ski house claims to be an Authorized Schwinn dealer, but I'm dubious.

151
00:08:52,309 --> 00:08:54,720
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not going to the ski house for a bike house.

152
00:08:54,861 --> 00:08:58,159
Speaker 1: Go in there for skis, but actually it's getting about time to get some skis.

153
00:08:59,081 --> 00:09:07,196
Speaker 1: but I was inspired by how expensive bikes are to Repair my old bike yet again, and I took it out riding yesterday.

154
00:09:07,216 --> 00:09:15,920
Speaker 1: I biked around town I did some trail riding and then I went across the Newburgh Beacon Bridge and back And on the other side I saw a mansion for sale for not that much money and I'm really curious.

155
00:09:16,061 --> 00:09:18,155
Speaker 1: But that's a story for another time.

156
00:09:18,175 --> 00:09:18,759
Speaker 0: It's probably haunted.

157
00:09:20,242 --> 00:09:21,486
Speaker 1: You know how awesome that would be.

158
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:22,772
Speaker 1: pretty awesome one.

159
00:09:22,832 --> 00:09:24,438
Speaker 1: James Randi would pay for the mansion.

160
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,222
Speaker 0: no He would.

161
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,554
Speaker 1: well once I proved it was haunted.

162
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:28,760
Speaker 1: You give me a million dollars.

163
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,566
Speaker 0: What if it was?

164
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:33,385
Speaker 0: Then it's a free house.

165
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:35,152
Speaker 1: It'd be awesome hanging out with the ghosts.

166
00:09:35,554 --> 00:09:36,297
Speaker 0: What's up ghosts?

167
00:09:36,658 --> 00:09:37,080
Speaker 0: How you doing?

168
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:43,856
Speaker 1: All right, that was kind of a long rant But I think it's relevant because mountain biking is a sport and sports are games and it's Tuesday night.

169
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:47,589
Speaker 0: Uh-huh Okay, shall we do some news type?

170
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:53,116
Speaker 1: actually as we got some news, I mean I just want to talk about so far Next time.

171
00:09:54,601 --> 00:09:58,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, so there's been a lot happening in the plastic instrument world lately.

172
00:09:58,521 --> 00:10:08,265
Speaker 1: Yeah I think Scott was the one who posited on the forums that if any game any game has the Beatles Led Zeppelin and Queen in it Simultaneously, it will be the winner.

173
00:10:08,506 --> 00:10:09,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean cuz check out.

174
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,914
Speaker 0: here's the problem, right?

175
00:10:11,376 --> 00:10:16,887
Speaker 0: You've actually got Competition actual competition going on between now.

176
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:19,225
Speaker 0: three Plastic instrument game makers.

177
00:10:19,265 --> 00:10:24,360
Speaker 0: see the original plastic instrument game was well plastic instrument and rhythm game.

178
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,700
Speaker 0: King was Konami and Konami is still the king with the DDR and the beat mania.

179
00:10:29,182 --> 00:10:31,551
Speaker 0: But they did guitar freaks way back in the day.

180
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,920
Speaker 1: Yes, which was one of those proof of concept.

181
00:10:34,081 --> 00:10:35,188
Speaker 1: But no one liked it.

182
00:10:35,208 --> 00:10:37,180
Speaker 1: Well a few a few people liked it.

183
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,484
Speaker 0: They liked it a lot and then Guitar Hero came along and that was like, oh, okay Now we got a guitar game.

184
00:10:42,504 --> 00:10:44,491
Speaker 0: that's actually, you know quality.

185
00:10:44,772 --> 00:10:48,855
Speaker 1: and if you want our thoughts on Guitar Hero I think we reviewed Guitar Hero 3 anyway.

186
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:56,152
Speaker 0: The point is, you know, the rock band came along and added the drums But now the Guitar Hero is coming along again.

187
00:10:56,172 --> 00:10:58,480
Speaker 0: the next well forgetting about the DS one.

188
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:02,454
Speaker 0: We don't give a shit about that even though it's available today and it's I don't recommend it.

189
00:11:03,036 --> 00:11:04,060
Speaker 0: It looks really dumb.

190
00:11:04,181 --> 00:11:05,731
Speaker 0: I have very slow confidence.

191
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:06,778
Speaker 1: I know who's buying that.

192
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,000
Speaker 1: Reviewers and grandmas who hear about Guitar Hero and buy it for the kid.

193
00:11:11,881 --> 00:11:23,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can see that being like the punk kids guitar here anyway Right, so the next Guitar Hero is gonna have drums and they're actually better than the rock band drums.

194
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:27,813
Speaker 0: There's only gonna be three, you know normal top wise drums instead of rock bands.

195
00:11:27,913 --> 00:11:31,789
Speaker 0: for but it looks like the pedal is superior And there's two symbols.

196
00:11:31,809 --> 00:11:33,780
Speaker 0: but you can sort of hold the symbols that you know.

197
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:38,468
Speaker 0: Do cool stuff like hit the symbol and then you know grab it with your hand to make it stop that kind of thing.

198
00:11:38,889 --> 00:11:41,679
Speaker 1: the drum kit to me is the only part that matters.

199
00:11:41,719 --> 00:11:45,153
Speaker 1: because Maybe well, maybe to first one to me personally.

200
00:11:45,173 --> 00:11:52,460
Speaker 1: I really Guitar hero was awesome until I actually owned it and played it more than transiently and I died.

201
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:54,537
Speaker 1: That game is not fun and not worth it.

202
00:11:54,617 --> 00:11:56,945
Speaker 1: and not It's not really fun.

203
00:11:57,025 --> 00:11:57,969
Speaker 1: It is Rockwell.

204
00:11:58,069 --> 00:12:00,659
Speaker 1: one rock band is a lot more fun even guitar wise it is.

205
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:06,437
Speaker 1: That's because Guitar Hero 3 turned into what DDR like 7th mix turned into.

206
00:12:06,457 --> 00:12:07,360
Speaker 0: that's exactly right.

207
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:10,980
Speaker 0: Guitar hero 2 is a lot more like the 4th mix plus of guitar heroes.

208
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:17,215
Speaker 1: Yeah but the drums drum sets in these games are the only instrument with the exception of singing.

209
00:12:17,235 --> 00:12:23,430
Speaker 1: that has a chance of Translating into real skill playing drums in a game like.

210
00:12:24,072 --> 00:12:31,093
Speaker 1: well, I guess drum hero if someone ever makes one or any of these games Will make you a decent like entry-level drummer.

211
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:32,940
Speaker 1: you'll learn real drumming technique.

212
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:36,253
Speaker 0: The problem is real drums are not set up in quite that position.

213
00:12:36,293 --> 00:12:39,764
Speaker 0: So you sort of have to actually Don't get into it.

214
00:12:39,784 --> 00:12:43,520
Speaker 1: drum sets are a complicated topic in and out there quite indeed.

215
00:12:43,742 --> 00:12:47,204
Speaker 0: but learning basic rhythms and Interested in like, you know.

216
00:12:47,465 --> 00:12:53,932
Speaker 0: because in a drum set every one of those drums like a separate its own separate thing And they just sort of put them all near each other.

217
00:12:53,952 --> 00:12:57,227
Speaker 0: and I've always sort of wondered like, you know Why don't people put them in different place?

218
00:12:57,247 --> 00:12:57,628
Speaker 0: They do.

219
00:12:57,749 --> 00:12:58,050
Speaker 1: there's all.

220
00:12:58,231 --> 00:13:04,967
Speaker 1: there's a whole different philosophies of different I'm not even gonna get into but there's all these different Nate like different Philosophies and names and like.

221
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:08,160
Speaker 1: we could use the blah blah blah method which gives you better access to your symbols.

222
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:12,896
Speaker 1: Some people use the double or the triple thumpers and yeah, it's interesting stuff there.

223
00:13:12,956 --> 00:13:18,531
Speaker 1: the drums anyway, not To qualify that I can't drum worth a god me either.

224
00:13:18,993 --> 00:13:20,558
Speaker 0: I can drum with like one drum.

225
00:13:20,578 --> 00:13:24,691
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, actually I could do a bass drum the kind like you.

226
00:13:24,711 --> 00:13:25,313
Speaker 1: can you really?

227
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,420
Speaker 1: yeah, can you really yeah, why not?

228
00:13:27,821 --> 00:13:31,140
Speaker 0: Okay, I got the good rhythms and all you got to do is hit it to the rhythms.

229
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:34,893
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta use both hands simultaneously sometimes with different rhythms.

230
00:13:34,953 --> 00:13:35,656
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could do that.

231
00:13:35,997 --> 00:13:39,160
Speaker 1: All right I'm kidding play some quads quince.

232
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:41,367
Speaker 1: Anyways, alright, so right.

233
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:56,840
Speaker 0: So guitar hero is really upping the drums and upping the guitar and from the information we have their drums and guitars are actually Technically superior to a rock band has now, but we don't know what rock bands doing.

234
00:13:56,901 --> 00:13:58,620
Speaker 0: But they've got to do some sort of improvements.

235
00:13:58,981 --> 00:14:11,219
Speaker 1: It's just gonna be an arms race till eventually the game will come with a piece of Freddie Mercury's rotted corpse, maybe the Konami who made the original guitar freaks and DDR and beat mania and such.

236
00:14:12,261 --> 00:14:15,896
Speaker 0: They're actually coming with their own drums and shit now up out of nowhere.

237
00:14:15,996 --> 00:14:16,940
Speaker 1: This is crazy to me.

238
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:21,299
Speaker 1: The only explanation is one Konami is crazy or two.

239
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:24,812
Speaker 1: They are going to come in with the artillery.

240
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:27,140
Speaker 1: that's gonna wipe everyone else out of that mark.

241
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:35,977
Speaker 0: Well, we'll say cuz Konami has the rhythms, but I don't know if they have the music or the equipments, you know Cuz even though Konami has made the great rhythm games in the past.

242
00:14:35,997 --> 00:14:40,500
Speaker 0: like DDR Their equipment for said games has always been lackluster.

243
00:14:40,901 --> 00:14:48,364
Speaker 0: Well except for any arcade EDR Konami should really make a new drum set type thing for the arcade Out.

244
00:14:48,384 --> 00:14:50,073
Speaker 0: that stupid MTV drumscape thing.

245
00:14:50,093 --> 00:14:50,635
Speaker 0: That's everywhere.

246
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:53,228
Speaker 1: That game is awful It is you know what Konami could.

247
00:14:53,268 --> 00:14:55,680
Speaker 1: if I were Konami I would pick a winner.

248
00:14:56,081 --> 00:15:02,740
Speaker 1: I'd pick one of the two and make a deal with them to license their game into the official arcade cabinet.

249
00:15:03,101 --> 00:15:05,208
Speaker 0: I know here the reason I want to talk about no.

250
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:09,765
Speaker 1: No, I would sell these cabinets to bars and Karaoke clubs.

251
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:10,307
Speaker 1: Yep.

252
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:13,260
Speaker 1: Oh, there's so much money to be made there Konami.

253
00:15:13,602 --> 00:15:15,089
Speaker 1: Yes, how much money cuz.

254
00:15:15,129 --> 00:15:16,677
Speaker 0: Konami can make the arcade machines.

255
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:21,493
Speaker 0: well actually Red octane harmon whoever it can also make the arcade machines.

256
00:15:21,534 --> 00:15:25,146
Speaker 0: They made the in the grooves remember Yeah, but so they could do it as well.

257
00:15:25,467 --> 00:15:28,076
Speaker 1: fault in the groove because the machines were amazing.

258
00:15:28,658 --> 00:15:31,619
Speaker 1: the game Played like it was made by fan boy.

259
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:38,424
Speaker 1: It was indeed was not immediately apparent to us in the groove was the awesomest thing until we played it for the second year In a row, right?

260
00:15:38,845 --> 00:15:41,134
Speaker 0: So the reason I want to talk about this?

261
00:15:41,154 --> 00:15:45,646
Speaker 0: because it's a great example of Who uses open systems.

262
00:15:45,706 --> 00:15:47,091
Speaker 0: and who uses closed system?

263
00:15:47,131 --> 00:15:53,000
Speaker 0: see Konami came out and they said we there should be a standard For these plastic instruments so people don't have to rebuy it.

264
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:58,240
Speaker 0: Of course, that's what's best for the consumer because an open standard is always best for the consumer, right?

265
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:02,299
Speaker 0: But the guitar hero and rock band people said no.

266
00:16:02,781 --> 00:16:09,615
Speaker 0: Well rock band people have always said well as the guitar heroes people's fault is not compatible and there are the guitar hero People just don't say anything.

267
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:15,108
Speaker 0: huh, all right, so Basically, this is a perfect example.

268
00:16:15,188 --> 00:16:18,740
Speaker 0: because look when you're the most popular guy in town, right?

269
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,846
Speaker 0: Let's say you're the guitar hero guy, right?

270
00:16:21,328 --> 00:16:25,180
Speaker 0: You don't want your plastic instruments to be compatible with other people's games.

271
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,684
Speaker 0: You know why sunk?

272
00:16:26,704 --> 00:16:32,420
Speaker 0: because well, no if you're the most popular game in town people are gonna buy your shit, right?

273
00:16:33,501 --> 00:16:45,249
Speaker 0: If you make your instruments work with other people's stuff, then people will buy those other games Instead of your game, so if they connect that Well, I guess when I said sunk cost I should have been more clear.

274
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:51,993
Speaker 1: if someone already owns one plastic drum set They're not going to buy a second plastic drum exact.

275
00:16:52,053 --> 00:16:53,940
Speaker 0: Well, they're much less likely to buy a second plastic.

276
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:57,019
Speaker 0: Well, we're excluding college kids, right?

277
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:05,409
Speaker 1: Therefore if you oh, oh my god, what I said college kids Because I'm not a college kid anymore.

278
00:17:05,429 --> 00:17:05,810
Speaker 0: No, you're not.

279
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,954
Speaker 0: Let me finish my shit.

280
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:21,859
Speaker 0: No, so if they make the drum set and the guitar a standard that anyone can do then people can actually easily Compete with them because everyone will buy the popular game and you know in the popular set and then they'll buy.

281
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:24,358
Speaker 0: Whichever game actually ends up being the best game.

282
00:17:25,301 --> 00:17:36,607
Speaker 0: if they don't make it an open thing then people will buy theirs because the most popular and Then they won't buy and they'll be much less likely to buy any of the others just because they don't want to sink their Money into yet another plastic drum set.

283
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:43,320
Speaker 1: and even aside from the money cost owning multiple plastic drum sets those things Where are you gonna put it right unless you have a lot of a lot of space?

284
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,575
Speaker 0: Yeah, the people who are down low the losers in town, right?

285
00:17:47,595 --> 00:17:48,760
Speaker 0: They were not so popular.

286
00:17:49,081 --> 00:17:57,179
Speaker 0: They want there to be a standard because if there's a standard and everyone has the same drum set, whatever then They can actually compete.

287
00:17:57,421 --> 00:18:11,119
Speaker 0: You know people will be willing to buy their game and they will judge which rhythm game is the best rather than I'm buying The one that is most popular because that is the one that is most likely to give me the most value for my money Regardless of whether it's actually, you know the best game in the end.

288
00:18:11,287 --> 00:18:18,380
Speaker 1: Yeah That's the saddest thing because an open standard would pretty much guarantee that whoever makes the best rhythm games would win.

289
00:18:18,561 --> 00:18:19,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, think about it.

290
00:18:19,127 --> 00:18:20,460
Speaker 0: If there was an open standard, right?

291
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,063
Speaker 0: It wouldn't be.

292
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:28,554
Speaker 0: I buy the drum set that works at the most popular game because that's the safe bet It would be I buy the highest quality drum set to be all this competition.

293
00:18:28,575 --> 00:18:29,940
Speaker 0: if who makes the best ones, you know.

294
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:43,320
Speaker 0: But they're all the same in terms of the feature set kind of like in DDR pads back in the day where you could buy the Two weeks is DDR pads are just normal PlayStation controllers and whatnot, right?

295
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:53,215
Speaker 0: There's open competition and there's different people making DDR pads and some of them are better than others and some of them are more expensive Than others until red octane pretty much came in and said look it's done.

296
00:18:53,395 --> 00:18:53,696
Speaker 0: It is.

297
00:18:53,737 --> 00:18:54,279
Speaker 0: There you go.

298
00:18:54,499 --> 00:18:56,255
Speaker 1: Yep It's either this or the arcade.

299
00:18:56,498 --> 00:19:06,400
Speaker 0: Yep But anyway, yeah The other thing is that There was this sort of speculation going on that there might be some Beatles action in the next round of games.

300
00:19:06,681 --> 00:19:07,825
Speaker 0: We'll see what comes of that.

301
00:19:08,085 --> 00:19:08,968
Speaker 0: That's all I can say.

302
00:19:09,049 --> 00:19:12,360
Speaker 1: that would I feel like that would really only fit rock band.

303
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:16,100
Speaker 0: It would because you know, I mean, you know the Beatles played guitars.

304
00:19:16,381 --> 00:19:20,800
Speaker 0: But I mean, well then again the next guitar hero is gonna have some drums.

305
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,564
Speaker 0: We'll see if it has.

306
00:19:21,584 --> 00:19:24,018
Speaker 1: at the same time the whole guitar hero thing.

307
00:19:25,381 --> 00:19:29,132
Speaker 1: It's always guitar solo rock metal something I don't.

308
00:19:29,273 --> 00:19:31,640
Speaker 1: I don't know there's no guitar solos in the Beatles.

309
00:19:32,181 --> 00:19:34,368
Speaker 1: Well, there are not not like that.

310
00:19:34,508 --> 00:19:35,531
Speaker 1: No, not no.

311
00:19:35,571 --> 00:19:36,935
Speaker 1: Squeed Lee's and me Lee's.

312
00:19:37,136 --> 00:19:41,073
Speaker 0: there are some occasional But it's not not like metal Squeed Lee's and me Lee's.

313
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:42,340
Speaker 0: it is totally a different kind of thing.

314
00:19:42,501 --> 00:19:44,027
Speaker 1: I think we should call them something different.

315
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:55,262
Speaker 0: if you want to simulate the Beatles experience for fun It really needs to be a full four-piece set action, you know vocals guitar bass drums the whole thing You know.

316
00:19:55,543 --> 00:20:01,465
Speaker 0: plus, I mean if you can only play guitar and drums in guitar in the next guitar hero And there's no singing or anything.

317
00:20:01,485 --> 00:20:05,580
Speaker 0: All right, then, you know, what if you're you know, what if you want to be George?

318
00:20:06,104 --> 00:20:08,388
Speaker 0: You sort of left out Plus.

319
00:20:08,428 --> 00:20:14,940
Speaker 1: I feel as though Guitar hero had a lot of momentum and a lot of style and a lot of class and everything was going for him.

320
00:20:15,562 --> 00:20:20,180
Speaker 1: And then in Guitar Hero 3 it's like they didn't understand what made their games popular.

321
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,529
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's because that was actually made by different people.

322
00:20:22,569 --> 00:20:25,320
Speaker 0: the people who made Guitar Hero 1 and 2 left and made rock band.

323
00:20:25,381 --> 00:20:26,600
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly.

324
00:20:26,781 --> 00:20:35,994
Speaker 1: But the people making the decisions for the brand didn't understand what made it popular which was one those developers And to that style, right?

325
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:38,924
Speaker 0: Oh Things are okay.

326
00:20:39,205 --> 00:20:39,967
Speaker 0: It'll it'll turn out.

327
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:44,000
Speaker 0: I think in the end, you know, I mean, I don't really have a huge need to play.

328
00:20:44,463 --> 00:20:46,560
Speaker 0: You know plastic instruments games so much anymore.

329
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:54,700
Speaker 0: I mean, I have Guitar Hero 3 and I have plastic guitar for it And that's that sort of sates any desire I might have you know for pretty much a long time.

330
00:20:54,821 --> 00:20:58,580
Speaker 0: So until there's like a full this is the be-all end-all.

331
00:20:59,062 --> 00:21:05,460
Speaker 0: I can just refrain from buying any of these things and maybe I can play it at conventions or something You know to test them out see which ones are good which ones are bad

332
00:21:06,341 --> 00:21:16,073
Speaker 1: Alright, so I'm not gonna talk about this very long But I have to bring it up because it's been poking around in the forums simmering if you will Smoldering under all right.

333
00:21:16,134 --> 00:21:16,558
Speaker 1: enough of that.

334
00:21:17,502 --> 00:21:18,727
Speaker 1: How the pyro?

335
00:21:19,168 --> 00:21:20,774
Speaker 1: they added weapons to you?

336
00:21:21,135 --> 00:21:22,540
Speaker 0: Why do you keep talking about this?

337
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,832
Speaker 0: This is always what you talk about.

338
00:21:24,913 --> 00:21:29,238
Speaker 1: There's no other video game news I want to talk about and because I realize what I must do all right.

339
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:43,339
Speaker 1: so basically the whole the whole deal here for the people who don't seem to understand of what it is that bothers us and specifically me about this whole achievement getting weapons thing and Team Fortress 2. is that a?

340
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:51,360
Speaker 1: Originally when Team Fortress 2 first came out I it was fun, but I realized right away that the game was not going to be a quote.

341
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:56,000
Speaker 1: hardcore team-based capture-the-flag first-person shooter.

342
00:21:56,861 --> 00:22:00,940
Speaker 1: That's quite a qualified genre there, but I think it's a. it's an existing genre.

343
00:22:01,563 --> 00:22:04,557
Speaker 0: It is an existing genre that is sort of that's had like a game.

344
00:22:05,281 --> 00:22:07,073
Speaker 0: It's down there with the adventure games.

345
00:22:07,174 --> 00:22:07,698
Speaker 0: pretty much.

346
00:22:07,718 --> 00:22:11,220
Speaker 0: in fact I think it's lower than the adventure games because I'm in a recent adventure game resurgence.

347
00:22:11,785 --> 00:22:24,480
Speaker 1: I mean if you can differentiate between Technical all these different kinds of metal and I can differentiate with all the different kinds of team-based FPS But the hardcore what I just said Really, I don't know if it's viable in the modern world.

348
00:22:24,881 --> 00:22:31,700
Speaker 1: And I don't blame T fortress for not being weapons factory or mega TF because that kind of game.

349
00:22:32,343 --> 00:22:34,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know if there's a market for it anymore.

350
00:22:35,241 --> 00:22:36,286
Speaker 0: I think there would be.

351
00:22:36,386 --> 00:22:39,700
Speaker 0: as long as you streamline the interface you could still keep the gameplay.

352
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:45,077
Speaker 0: But if the interface of olden days cannot stick around well a modern interface on that game.

353
00:22:45,118 --> 00:22:45,760
Speaker 0: It would totally work.

354
00:22:46,063 --> 00:22:47,119
Speaker 1: We'll get to that in a minute.

355
00:22:47,601 --> 00:23:02,030
Speaker 1: Because while in the end and this is after a lot of play and I can pretty much speak quiet within a qualified manner now Without having to say well, we'll have to see how it all turns out Team fortress 2 was not that game But what it had going for it was that it could have.

356
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:11,874
Speaker 1: it could be a good game in and of itself in a genre That is separate from that Emphasizing the team-based part a lot more and de-emphasizing the first-person shooter part.

357
00:23:12,075 --> 00:23:16,728
Speaker 0: The problem was is the maps Reduced all decisions to obvious.

358
00:23:16,949 --> 00:23:18,594
Speaker 1: Yes the game one.

359
00:23:18,634 --> 00:23:20,118
Speaker 1: the game things that are winning with the game.

360
00:23:20,158 --> 00:23:23,320
Speaker 1: the style I've said this before we keep saying it.

361
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:32,484
Speaker 1: I'll never say it again because I don't think it needs to be said again the style a team fortress 2 is Full of wind to a degree that I cannot express to you So perfect.

362
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:37,160
Speaker 0: the interface was also really terrific compared to pretty much every other FPS has ever existed.

363
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:39,508
Speaker 0: It is actually accessible and it worked.

364
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:42,940
Speaker 1: the style and the interface and the grass all that stuff was there.

365
00:23:43,462 --> 00:23:49,447
Speaker 1: the only problems with the game were that the maps were too small for Strategy or FPSing to matter.

366
00:23:49,768 --> 00:23:52,278
Speaker 1: the weapons were too inaccurate for FPSing to matter.

367
00:23:52,298 --> 00:23:56,947
Speaker 1: when I say matter I mean matter in the quote-unquote hardcore full-on way.

368
00:23:57,007 --> 00:24:02,070
Speaker 1: the skill caps were pretty low and Beyond all that everyone really only had one weapon.

369
00:24:02,572 --> 00:24:04,882
Speaker 1: Yep may end like one special ability.

370
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:05,967
Speaker 1: that was kind of weeks.

371
00:24:06,028 --> 00:24:14,881
Speaker 1: as a result there weren't a lot of strategic options and there weren't a lot of FPS skill options and the maps were so small that the Game ended up being very not fun.

372
00:24:14,901 --> 00:24:16,330
Speaker 1: If you were good at FPS is at all.

373
00:24:16,491 --> 00:24:19,933
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you play, you know team fortress 2 I mean at the.

374
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:35,590
Speaker 0: you know, the day it came out and you actually had coordinated intelligent teams It was pretty much gonna be a stalemate, you know Where only randomness would decide because the maps are so small that the optimal strategy is obvious And it's just a matter of getting everyone to actually do it.

375
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:43,996
Speaker 1: I mean if you're playing on eight on eight, there is an absolute perfect defense for the capture the flag to fort Yep, but skipping all that.

376
00:24:44,016 --> 00:24:50,597
Speaker 1: I was of the mind that all you had to do was either now Depending on which direction you went.

377
00:24:50,637 --> 00:24:53,750
Speaker 1: It's like each of these things would have taken the game in a different direction.

378
00:24:54,174 --> 00:25:04,176
Speaker 1: I think all of them could have been good if They had made the maps a lot bigger and a lot more varied and a lot more open and made a lot more Capture the flag maps.

379
00:25:04,537 --> 00:25:06,605
Speaker 1: Yeah, then the game was great.

380
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:12,244
Speaker 1: because when they made CTF well That map was amazing and I suddenly had all this new hope for the game.

381
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:18,550
Speaker 1: and then pretty much No one played that map after the first two weeks and now it's pretty much gone great.

382
00:25:18,911 --> 00:25:36,590
Speaker 1: So, alright, or if they had given everyone one more weapon one more special ability one more tactical decision to make it didn't need to me the hardcore craziness of having eight different kinds of grenades and four different shotguns, but One more thing and everything would have been great.

383
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:46,370
Speaker 1: It would have added a lot of strategic and a lot of tacticality to make up a bunch of perfectly chromulant words Mm-hmm, and that would have even made up for the low skill cap on the straight-up FPS.

384
00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:58,708
Speaker 1: It wouldn't have been a hardcore FPS But it would have been a hardcore team-based strategy game that happens to be first-person as long as they change up the maps, too Yes, but even if they had just done that like all these little things would have fixed it.

385
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:02,400
Speaker 1: So suddenly I find out that they're doing the last of those.

386
00:26:02,681 --> 00:26:05,370
Speaker 1: they're giving everyone one more thing or two more things.

387
00:26:05,992 --> 00:26:15,670
Speaker 1: But then they pull this bullshit on me that I have to level up to get him That now the game is stateful as opposed to stateless and that wasn't even in my conception.

388
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,375
Speaker 1: This is this brand new.

389
00:26:17,415 --> 00:26:20,344
Speaker 1: It's like they took the game that was in a genre.

390
00:26:20,725 --> 00:26:29,590
Speaker 1: It was a team-based First-person nominally strategic game and they pulled it out of that and they made it something different.

391
00:26:29,731 --> 00:26:39,250
Speaker 1: It's in a different genre of game to the point that I don't know what to do with it anymore Because I played with a new pyro the backburner the thing where you can shoot air.

392
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:40,936
Speaker 1: That added so much to.

393
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:43,103
Speaker 1: I cannot express to you how much that adds to the game.

394
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:50,588
Speaker 1: strategically it almost made Capture the flag on to Ford viable almost even with the crappy map design.

395
00:26:50,608 --> 00:27:02,841
Speaker 1: It was viable yeah, but no, I have to level up to get the flare gun and all and extinguisher and all these other things and The read basically, I don't need to say why.

396
00:27:02,881 --> 00:27:11,186
Speaker 1: I've said why a million times but they've taken a game That was an even stateless first-person team-based game and they made it uneven and stateful.

397
00:27:11,487 --> 00:27:17,248
Speaker 1: and the oven unevenness Decided solely by the arbitrary amount of time you spend leveling up by getting these achievements.

398
00:27:17,328 --> 00:27:19,433
Speaker 1: and I Guess I'm ranting here.

399
00:27:19,453 --> 00:27:20,216
Speaker 1: So I'll wrap it up.

400
00:27:20,718 --> 00:27:22,203
Speaker 1: I don't even care about the achievements.

401
00:27:22,464 --> 00:27:23,126
Speaker 1: I'm not Scott.

402
00:27:23,347 --> 00:27:24,652
Speaker 1: achievements are great Go nuts.

403
00:27:25,314 --> 00:27:32,049
Speaker 1: The problem is when the achievements matter for what otherwise was a stateless multiplayer versus game.

404
00:27:32,591 --> 00:27:39,952
Speaker 1: The fact it doesn't matter that the weapons may not be technically a hundred percent better than the weapons that you get if you haven't Leveled up.

405
00:27:40,334 --> 00:27:41,017
Speaker 1: they're different.

406
00:27:41,057 --> 00:27:42,263
Speaker 1: They're different enough to matter.

407
00:27:42,544 --> 00:27:45,803
Speaker 1: if they're not different enough to matter There's no reason to have them and everyone says they are.

408
00:27:46,125 --> 00:27:46,950
Speaker 1: I've played a little bit.

409
00:27:46,990 --> 00:27:51,206
Speaker 1: They definitely are but by forcing you to level up to get them.

410
00:27:51,226 --> 00:27:52,330
Speaker 1: You've made the game stateful.

411
00:27:52,651 --> 00:27:56,208
Speaker 1: It's not fair or balanced anymore, and I don't know what to do.

412
00:27:56,991 --> 00:27:59,700
Speaker 1: Anyway to get to wrap all this up.

413
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,087
Speaker 1: I figured out I want to do to fix this.

414
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:04,890
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm We've got to just make a goddamn mod.

415
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,498
Speaker 0: I think we do because water is poison really.

416
00:28:07,558 --> 00:28:11,070
Speaker 0: he pointed it out to me and I didn't realize this before right?

417
00:28:11,930 --> 00:28:15,330
Speaker 0: All the FPS is that we really liked throughout history.

418
00:28:15,912 --> 00:28:22,310
Speaker 0: Have all the multiplayer ones with the exception of tribes to the exception of tribes to have all been mods.

419
00:28:22,551 --> 00:28:25,270
Speaker 0: Counter-strike was a mod even though it's not a mod now.

420
00:28:25,351 --> 00:28:26,589
Speaker 0: It was a mod back in the day.

421
00:28:27,011 --> 00:28:32,830
Speaker 1: Natural selection action quake weapons factory mega TF team fortress capture the flag lithium death net hell.

422
00:28:33,532 --> 00:28:36,342
Speaker 1: Even deathmatch was sucked and no one played it.

423
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:39,794
Speaker 1: when it came out people played lithium deathmatch Which was a mod.

424
00:28:40,075 --> 00:28:49,911
Speaker 0: every game every FPS that we have ever enjoyed in the history of the world With the exceptions of tribes 2 and maybe golden eye and a rim doesn't like golden eye though I

425
00:28:49,972 --> 00:28:51,367
Speaker 1: like to golden eye when it was

426
00:28:51,549 --> 00:28:58,530
Speaker 0: out The exception of those two every FPS ever that wasn't single-player that we liked was a mod.

427
00:28:59,154 --> 00:29:06,710
Speaker 0: Team fortress 2 is not a mod It's not and I realized that hey We just had to mod it because it's now what we want is never gonna happen.

428
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:09,323
Speaker 0: All we need to do is you need to make bigger maps.

429
00:29:09,504 --> 00:29:10,750
Speaker 0: So you need map making action.

430
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:13,830
Speaker 0: We don't make better maps - we need to make everything faster.

431
00:29:14,092 --> 00:29:16,870
Speaker 0: So, you know, we have to keep the ratios of speed the same.

432
00:29:16,951 --> 00:29:27,749
Speaker 0: The Scout should still be twice as fast as you know The there are four times as fast the heavier ever much but everyone's speed needs to be raised equally that way You know, you have to have faster reaction times and whatnot.

433
00:29:28,452 --> 00:29:28,955
Speaker 0: You need to make.

434
00:29:29,015 --> 00:29:31,727
Speaker 0: if we can we should make the models a little smaller.

435
00:29:31,807 --> 00:29:34,196
Speaker 0: if we can't do that It's you know, bigger map should be enough.

436
00:29:34,257 --> 00:29:34,437
Speaker 1: Yep.

437
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:36,305
Speaker 1: Also, you got to make the hitboxes smaller.

438
00:29:36,325 --> 00:29:42,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, if we can do that and Make all the weapons more accurate or otherwise not be able to hit anything.

439
00:29:42,407 --> 00:29:45,318
Speaker 1: and beyond that I've got two minds.

440
00:29:45,339 --> 00:30:01,048
Speaker 1: I'm not sure which way to go with this yet but either make the game in this kind of team fortress the way they originally designed the game balanced and Clean methodology where every class as a very small very specific subset of strategies and weapons.

441
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:07,109
Speaker 1: or Go all out and try Scott's idea of what if you make a modern hardcore FPS?

442
00:30:07,990 --> 00:30:22,642
Speaker 1: And I think weapons factory was the last team based about that whole thing I said before that long string of words if you made that but you took these style and mostly the interface of Teamfortress so it doesn't completely suck to play the game.

443
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:24,910
Speaker 1: If you're not a stupid nerd you sit there for an hour scripting.

444
00:30:25,251 --> 00:30:32,159
Speaker 0: I definitely think that it's you know, the best way to go right now just be to take Team Fortress 2 in its state Unlock all the achievements.

445
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,990
Speaker 0: also everyone gets all the weapons, right?

446
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:37,572
Speaker 0: So we'd have to wait for them to make the weapons for the rest of the classes because you know You don't want.

447
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,422
Speaker 0: you know this bullshit where they put it out.

448
00:30:39,462 --> 00:30:40,889
Speaker 0: want it for one class at a time.

449
00:30:41,253 --> 00:30:43,070
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, no, cuz that's no good.

450
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,493
Speaker 0: It's got to be.

451
00:30:43,553 --> 00:30:46,110
Speaker 0: every class is the same amount of stuff, right?

452
00:30:46,732 --> 00:30:53,610
Speaker 0: Then you know bigger maps up the speed up the accuracy and it dad that should be good enough right at least to start.

453
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,197
Speaker 1: I mean as has been proven by CTF.

454
00:30:56,237 --> 00:31:00,950
Speaker 1: Well bigger maps alone make the game twice as good immediately.

455
00:31:01,243 --> 00:31:08,324
Speaker 1: Yep Just bigger maps with more paths to the point that there is no optimal defense or offense And then everything else is just icing on the cake from there.

456
00:31:08,344 --> 00:31:17,210
Speaker 1: Yep so I'm not going to talk about Team Fortress 2 again kind of like how Jack Thompson put the kibosh on that.

457
00:31:17,612 --> 00:31:26,029
Speaker 1: He I don't think he'll ever remember my rule I can't talk about Jack Thompson unless he tops himself by an order of magnitude and he hasn't yet.

458
00:31:26,270 --> 00:31:27,715
Speaker 1: Hey Team Fortress 2.

459
00:31:27,715 --> 00:31:32,090
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about until we or someone we know stop shit talking.

460
00:31:32,571 --> 00:31:37,968
Speaker 1: Well, I guess we haven't shit talked yet, but we're going to be shortly and starts modding Team Fortress 2.

461
00:31:37,968 --> 00:31:42,822
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe I'll start writing up my RFC for the hardcore.

462
00:31:43,263 --> 00:31:45,128
Speaker 0: Don't need an RFC for this one.

463
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:46,312
Speaker 0: in our know It's not.

464
00:31:46,352 --> 00:31:47,176
Speaker 1: I want to see.

465
00:31:47,357 --> 00:31:59,342
Speaker 1: I want to define the parameters that specify Team base multiplayer stateless capture-the-flag First-person shooter, it's I it's a suspect doc or it's?

466
00:31:59,562 --> 00:32:02,050
Speaker 0: it's not an RFC and RFC is the wrong kind of document.

467
00:32:08,522 --> 00:32:12,656
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day things of the day.

468
00:32:12,676 --> 00:32:16,400
Speaker 1: All right, so I'm gonna totally cop out here.

469
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:22,420
Speaker 1: But I think it's relevant because we talked about Bimani and I've been really feeling the the DDR groove lately.

470
00:32:22,721 --> 00:32:28,042
Speaker 1: I've also been feeling that my desire to play DDR has been rising constantly.

471
00:32:28,143 --> 00:32:34,328
Speaker 1: despite this the floor in our living room is not strong enough to support us and Playing on the deck isn't really an option.

472
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:35,554
Speaker 0: That's sort of the reason Alice.

473
00:32:35,574 --> 00:32:40,171
Speaker 1: I haven't gotten we fit or anything Yeah, but I really want to play DDR.

474
00:32:40,613 --> 00:32:45,953
Speaker 1: and if you really want to play DDR I recommend you watch these two videos, which I don't think DDR season.

475
00:32:45,973 --> 00:32:47,399
Speaker 0: That's for sure things of the day.

476
00:32:48,324 --> 00:32:51,767
Speaker 1: DJ 8-ball is perhaps my favorite Freestyler.

477
00:32:51,867 --> 00:32:53,458
Speaker 1: you see there are two ways to play DDR.

478
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:54,544
Speaker 1: well three ways.

479
00:32:55,006 --> 00:33:00,868
Speaker 1: one is the fanboy shuffle and you suck - is Playing to do really well with all your friends.

480
00:33:01,169 --> 00:33:06,030
Speaker 1: and three is playing not to get perfect scores But to show off.

481
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,945
Speaker 1: for anyone who's watching Mm-hmm.

482
00:33:08,046 --> 00:33:09,840
Speaker 1: That is my favorite way of dancing.

483
00:33:10,001 --> 00:33:10,924
Speaker 1: It'll always will be.

484
00:33:11,225 --> 00:33:16,003
Speaker 1: messing around on the machine is so much more fun than trying to get a triple-a whatever plus It hurts a lot less.

485
00:33:16,504 --> 00:33:17,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, well depending.

486
00:33:17,728 --> 00:33:18,731
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think what you do.

487
00:33:18,751 --> 00:33:26,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, or if you fail at doing plus Now who?

488
00:33:26,627 --> 00:33:31,712
Speaker 1: that is my baby's mom, okay DJ Paul is famous for one being awesome.

489
00:33:32,034 --> 00:33:34,463
Speaker 1: for two exemplifying everything I love about DDR.

490
00:33:35,025 --> 00:33:39,360
Speaker 1: three for the Nintendo foot, which you'll see in cafe, which is also one of my favorite DDR songs.

491
00:33:40,183 --> 00:33:59,338
Speaker 1: And four for pretending that he had a leg injury for the time up to a tournament Deciding to go on anyway in a show of good faith and effort and for a cheer from the crowd walking up with his crutch cane Revealing at the last second that he is not in fact injured at all and then doing his routine with the cane.

492
00:33:59,659 --> 00:34:01,265
Speaker 1: Yep He is my hero.

493
00:34:01,285 --> 00:34:02,108
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

494
00:34:02,991 --> 00:34:04,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, DJ Paul is.

495
00:34:04,436 --> 00:34:05,400
Speaker 0: he was pretty terrific.

496
00:34:05,721 --> 00:34:10,827
Speaker 0: He's kind of old-school and with the DDR back in the third fourth mix days I don't know if he's still around.

497
00:34:10,907 --> 00:34:11,330
Speaker 0: maybe he'll.

498
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:13,159
Speaker 0: he'll find us from the show or something.

499
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:14,587
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean our other.

500
00:34:14,726 --> 00:34:17,340
Speaker 0: there are other DDR freestyle people are equally awesome.

501
00:34:18,340 --> 00:34:19,003
Speaker 0: Disrespecting them.

502
00:34:19,184 --> 00:34:21,978
Speaker 1: No, but we are definitely like art, you know people have different styles of DDR.

503
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:25,737
Speaker 1: Our style is the third mix Korean through fifth mix style.

504
00:34:25,797 --> 00:34:26,199
Speaker 0: That's right.

505
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,966
Speaker 1: That is where we live and that is our home.

506
00:34:28,085 --> 00:34:30,514
Speaker 0: fourth mix plus being the pinnacle of all DDR.

507
00:34:30,534 --> 00:34:31,777
Speaker 0: God always will be.

508
00:34:31,797 --> 00:34:35,891
Speaker 1: I Can't express to you how much I would love to own a fourth mix plus machine.

509
00:34:35,931 --> 00:34:38,219
Speaker 0: I would pay a thousand two thousand dollars.

510
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:40,580
Speaker 1: Sadly, they cost about eight thousand dollars.

511
00:34:41,284 --> 00:34:46,664
Speaker 0: Well, we've more than one bicycle So check this out.

512
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:50,255
Speaker 0: there was a Wii update this week that changed a few things around.

513
00:34:50,396 --> 00:34:55,071
Speaker 0: nothing really exciting But all those people who are doing the Wii homebrew with the Twilight hack.

514
00:34:55,351 --> 00:34:59,239
Speaker 0: They were like, oh no this broke our Twilight hacks sorrow.

515
00:35:00,340 --> 00:35:06,704
Speaker 0: Well in a very short amount of time they un Broke the hacks.

516
00:35:06,925 --> 00:35:08,973
Speaker 0: in other words, you can hack your Wii again.

517
00:35:08,993 --> 00:35:19,363
Speaker 0: Not only can you hack your Wii again there's a video here that was posted that I watched that shows how ludicrously easy it is to hack the Wii and Get your own get.

518
00:35:19,403 --> 00:35:33,238
Speaker 0: basically you put this homebrew channel on your Wii and then the homebrew channel can read Programs you put on your SD card and then you can run Programs on the Wii through the SD card and they demonstrate quake.

519
00:35:33,479 --> 00:35:38,715
Speaker 0: one Played with the Wiimote and such and I think I'm gonna go for it.

520
00:35:39,036 --> 00:35:40,280
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do it now.

521
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:42,126
Speaker 1: Now what's the sudden turd about?

522
00:35:42,146 --> 00:35:43,510
Speaker 1: how come you're suddenly interested in this?

523
00:35:43,951 --> 00:35:46,419
Speaker 0: because I saw video and it's so stupidly easy.

524
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:54,116
Speaker 0: and Nintendo did it and Nintendo didn't update and the update didn't ruin anyone's wheeze Even though it's sort of broke them for like a little bit.

525
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:56,924
Speaker 0: So I'm Feeling like it's pretty safe.

526
00:35:57,305 --> 00:35:59,150
Speaker 0: Like I'm not gonna say it's safe, you know 100%.

527
00:35:59,150 --> 00:36:05,382
Speaker 0: you know, you do risk losing your Wii forever but you know Why not?

528
00:36:05,543 --> 00:36:06,988
Speaker 0: I can make the Wii pretty awesome.

529
00:36:07,009 --> 00:36:08,374
Speaker 0: I don't think it's gonna hurt now.

530
00:36:08,474 --> 00:36:17,620
Speaker 1: It bothers me that Nintendo Doesn't want this to happen and isn't embracing this sort of development because I mean, I guess I'm not surprised but why Nintendo?

531
00:36:18,122 --> 00:36:22,840
Speaker 1: Why must you at every opportunity fall just one step short of true glory?

532
00:36:23,703 --> 00:36:28,400
Speaker 1: They're always one step short of making the perfect console the perfect game the perfect everything.

533
00:36:29,981 --> 00:36:30,423
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

534
00:36:30,663 --> 00:36:32,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is like, huh?

535
00:36:33,271 --> 00:36:35,498
Speaker 0: I've got this thing here and you know this.

536
00:36:37,582 --> 00:36:41,740
Speaker 0: It's like trying to think of something that they can demonstrate the unfulfilled potential.

537
00:36:42,226 --> 00:36:52,480
Speaker 0: It's like if you had a Ferrari right and the Ferrari could go 200 miles an hour and had six gears and Whenever you drove it, you only got up to fifth gear and then you sort of slowed down.

538
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:54,248
Speaker 0: You never you never use that sixth gear.

539
00:36:54,288 --> 00:36:57,100
Speaker 0: You never you never went to the max speed of the Ferrari.

540
00:36:57,140 --> 00:37:01,276
Speaker 0: You just like yeah, we got it, but we're not gonna use our full strength.

541
00:37:01,296 --> 00:37:02,822
Speaker 0: You haven't seen my full strength You know what?

542
00:37:03,104 --> 00:37:06,683
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna suddenly reveal my full strength in the last episode Like I should.

543
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:09,600
Speaker 0: I'm just never gonna reveal it ever at all.

544
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:12,510
Speaker 0: I don't need it and it's like ah, you bastards.

545
00:37:12,550 --> 00:37:13,353
Speaker 0: I need that full strength.

546
00:37:14,075 --> 00:37:15,339
Speaker 0: I can see that full strength right there.

547
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:20,534
Speaker 1: So tonight over the weekend, of course the visigoths came out.

548
00:37:20,575 --> 00:37:21,900
Speaker 1: They didn't goth up the house too much.

549
00:37:22,322 --> 00:37:25,840
Speaker 0: They weren't here as much as they were in the past as we move the game over to Alex's apartment.

550
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:37,200
Speaker 1: But we played our burning wheel and among other things Scott Johnson and Laura brought a couple of games some political game that While it was dumb and ended up being great only because it was late at night and whenever playing it again.

551
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:41,115
Speaker 1: Also because a lot of silly things happened due to the way the rules were.

552
00:37:41,376 --> 00:37:44,147
Speaker 1: yeah broken rules Yes, but sometimes broken.

553
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:53,020
Speaker 1: maybe it's weird but people like us You know people are really into these kind of hardcore rules lawyer II specific, you know real German strategy games.

554
00:37:53,842 --> 00:38:08,440
Speaker 1: When a game's rules are actually broken and like broken in a crazy way It's almost Entertaining in and of itself to play that game Trying to break the game and enjoying the chaos that ensues.

555
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,604
Speaker 0: Well, I mean think about it right?

556
00:38:09,644 --> 00:38:13,840
Speaker 0: the rules of a board game are the words written in the book that comes with the game.

557
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,939
Speaker 0: You understand the words that are written in this book.

558
00:38:16,221 --> 00:38:25,199
Speaker 0: the rules of a video game are the code the soft the code that is written to create the Software the zeros and ones on the game disk or in the install or wherever us.

559
00:38:25,541 --> 00:38:31,579
Speaker 1: Putting a game in a. putting a board game in a weird state is like getting into the minus world in Mario 1.

560
00:38:31,579 --> 00:38:36,420
Speaker 0: exactly It's like, you know, basically the definition of cheating is if you break the rules.

561
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:53,143
Speaker 0: So if you do something to a video game that either, you know modifies the code which is basically like taking an eraser to the rule book and writing your own rules as cheating or Doing something that goes against the software somehow like a game genie well, I guess that's sort of rewriting.

562
00:38:53,163 --> 00:38:55,087
Speaker 0: but anyway that is cheating.

563
00:38:55,107 --> 00:39:02,690
Speaker 0: in a video game and A board game doing something that is contradictory to the words written in the book is cheating.

564
00:39:03,153 --> 00:39:04,884
Speaker 1: It's also sadly trivial.

565
00:39:05,025 --> 00:39:05,769
Speaker 0: All right, I move.

566
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:07,834
Speaker 1: Everyone's a queen.

567
00:39:07,875 --> 00:39:08,498
Speaker 1: Let's see what happens.

568
00:39:09,162 --> 00:39:10,530
Speaker 0: I'll just put my guy on boardwalk.

569
00:39:10,811 --> 00:39:19,321
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know it's the first turn of the game and I couldn't have possibly rolled that high number, but whatever No, so it's how I roll.

570
00:39:19,381 --> 00:39:21,149
Speaker 0: I roll my d100 from Monopoly.

571
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:24,629
Speaker 0: I Wish okay make the game maybe actually good.

572
00:39:25,912 --> 00:39:28,766
Speaker 0: Huh, right we want to play Monopoly with like 2d 20s.

573
00:39:30,014 --> 00:39:31,444
Speaker 1: I think it would have to be no 2d 20s.

574
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:41,703
Speaker 1: we'd have to look at the board right and turn into it into a circular graph and then figure out a Probability curve of roles that would make the auctions the most fair.

575
00:39:41,743 --> 00:39:47,050
Speaker 0: they can be so in a video game You can sometimes do things that aren't cheating.

576
00:39:47,070 --> 00:39:52,429
Speaker 0: They're perfectly within the software's, you know rules and software's ability that the game is.

577
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:53,874
Speaker 0: But you can.

578
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:55,499
Speaker 0: they're not sort of intended.

579
00:39:55,539 --> 00:40:04,466
Speaker 0: you sort of break the game in a way like in Metroid 1 is great Examples of doing like, you know door wall ball jump things to go to you know rooms.

580
00:40:04,526 --> 00:40:09,365
Speaker 0: or in Mario 64 Were you like scooting up the stairs real fast to beat in the game in nine minutes?

581
00:40:09,787 --> 00:40:10,510
Speaker 0: You're not cheating.

582
00:40:10,912 --> 00:40:15,370
Speaker 0: You're doing something that is within the rules of the game because the software of the game is the rules of the game.

583
00:40:15,851 --> 00:40:18,198
Speaker 0: But you're still sort of it's not intended.

584
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:26,789
Speaker 0: and you can do the same with board games, you know the rules of the board game either in Word or in spirit intend for you to do one thing.

585
00:40:27,292 --> 00:40:40,510
Speaker 0: But by being a lawyer and by following the word the words in the in the rule book to the letter you can sort of glitch the board games and Get away and that you might be the only people in the world who find amusement in doing well.

586
00:40:40,570 --> 00:40:47,283
Speaker 0: It's usually also the sign of a very bad board game because poorly written rules is usually a bad game and usually only play it.

587
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:54,681
Speaker 1: Asians came up and infinitely passed around cards and early on.

588
00:40:54,701 --> 00:40:57,048
Speaker 1: We almost broke the game by everyone passing.

589
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:06,813
Speaker 1: Yep So, but the other game they brought over that we did in fact play was none other than shadows over Camelot.

590
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:10,810
Speaker 0: shadows over camera is a game that we have gotten over camelot, right?

591
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:14,925
Speaker 0: It's a game we had played once before the Chevalier de la tabula Ronda.

592
00:41:15,126 --> 00:41:16,290
Speaker 0: It's also a very Wikipedia.

593
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:18,189
Speaker 0: It's also a very popular game.

594
00:41:18,653 --> 00:41:24,421
Speaker 0: It gets talked about a lot and you know It's got that popular King Arthur theme and it's got a pretty high production value.

595
00:41:24,461 --> 00:41:27,330
Speaker 0: and it's it's sold even in little tiny game stores.

596
00:41:27,910 --> 00:41:30,240
Speaker 0: So we figured hey, we've played this game twice.

597
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,269
Speaker 0: We pretty much know everything there is to know about this game.

598
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,774
Speaker 0: now Let's do a show on it.

599
00:41:34,076 --> 00:41:34,276
Speaker 1: Yep.

600
00:41:34,316 --> 00:41:36,906
Speaker 1: Now we played this game once a long time ago.

601
00:41:36,926 --> 00:41:37,870
Speaker 0: I was not long ago.

602
00:41:38,192 --> 00:41:39,383
Speaker 1: That was always years ago.

603
00:41:39,403 --> 00:41:42,038
Speaker 0: Yeah, man I was back when we little over a year ago.

604
00:41:42,058 --> 00:41:49,630
Speaker 1: that was back when we used to go to Mars to play board games and Those two cool people were there who we haven't seen since that fateful night.

605
00:41:49,811 --> 00:41:52,749
Speaker 1: Yep, that which is kind of sad because they were really cool.

606
00:41:52,930 --> 00:41:55,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, we actually went over to their apartment and played board games.

607
00:41:56,102 --> 00:41:57,648
Speaker 1: Yep, and there was a camelot.

608
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:00,181
Speaker 1: Yes, and we brought Pete along as well.

609
00:42:00,423 --> 00:42:00,805
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

610
00:42:01,127 --> 00:42:01,670
Speaker 1: That was a good time.

611
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,156
Speaker 1: We also played one other game.

612
00:42:03,176 --> 00:42:05,647
Speaker 1: Do we play with them said Starfarers of Catan?

613
00:42:05,848 --> 00:42:10,390
Speaker 1: Yeah That was a good time even though that game is also broken.

614
00:42:10,993 --> 00:42:14,370
Speaker 0: But I really like those little quest cards, but once you memorize them forget it.

615
00:42:14,511 --> 00:42:16,330
Speaker 1: But it's still a fun game once kind of like this.

616
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:28,096
Speaker 1: so shadows ever Camelot if you don't know is one of those beat the game games where everybody cooperates to kind of beat this free setup or Semi random board.

617
00:42:28,397 --> 00:42:43,139
Speaker 1: but like many of these games because most games have this element There's also the possibility of the traitor or the bad guy or one player saying fuck all y'all I win you all lose the board loses - yep That's good stuff.

618
00:42:43,462 --> 00:42:48,850
Speaker 1: so yeah Lord of the Rings I think it was impossible, but I tried every single time I had the ring at the end of the game.

619
00:42:49,030 --> 00:42:52,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but basically you know it's the game right.

620
00:42:53,283 --> 00:42:55,610
Speaker 0: the board is in some sort of you know position.

621
00:42:55,730 --> 00:43:06,435
Speaker 0: It's in some configuration and the goal of the game is to get the board into a different configuration Which is winning and you don't want the board to go into the bad configuration Which is losing.

622
00:43:06,455 --> 00:43:12,630
Speaker 0: now all the players work together To get the board into the good configuration and the rules of the game.

623
00:43:13,012 --> 00:43:16,550
Speaker 0: Sort of force the board to always fight against you on its own.

624
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:20,089
Speaker 0: You know you keep flipping over cards that do bad things you know and such.

625
00:43:20,189 --> 00:43:25,049
Speaker 1: now We'll hold off until we're gonna review shadows over Camelot first because that's the important part.

626
00:43:25,471 --> 00:43:32,648
Speaker 1: But we're gonna state we're not going to talk much about What it means to be a beat the game game or kind of?

627
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:35,701
Speaker 1: Exactly what that entails in the end for gaming as a whole.

628
00:43:35,741 --> 00:43:39,239
Speaker 1: because I mean if you really break it down I'll be the game.

629
00:43:39,259 --> 00:43:40,630
Speaker 1: games are just state machines.

630
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:47,366
Speaker 1: They end up being not fun unless you have a lot of kind of meta elements there right.

631
00:43:47,647 --> 00:43:52,290
Speaker 0: so in shadows over Camelot You're you're all the kings of King Arthur's the Knights of King Arthur's court.

632
00:43:52,310 --> 00:43:53,761
Speaker 1: Yes, you're not the king King Arthur.

633
00:43:53,862 --> 00:43:54,870
Speaker 1: one King right Arthur?

634
00:43:55,251 --> 00:44:05,725
Speaker 0: And there's a bunch of quests about to go on the quest for the Holy Grail the quest for Excalibur the quest for Lancelot's Armor the quest against the red dragon which appears after you get or don't get Lancelot's.

635
00:44:05,745 --> 00:44:06,950
Speaker 1: I gotta go get Excalibur.

636
00:44:07,231 --> 00:44:10,762
Speaker 1: Meanwhile the Picts and the Saxons.

637
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:13,652
Speaker 0: the Picts and the Saxons are constantly coming after Camelot.

638
00:44:13,672 --> 00:44:14,957
Speaker 0: you have to constantly fight them off.

639
00:44:15,298 --> 00:44:17,065
Speaker 0: the Black Knight always wants to joust.

640
00:44:17,085 --> 00:44:18,150
Speaker 0: you have to keep jousting him.

641
00:44:18,310 --> 00:44:19,778
Speaker 1: Guinevere is a total bitch.

642
00:44:19,838 --> 00:44:21,085
Speaker 0: Guinevere is a total bitch.

643
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:26,870
Speaker 0: there are There's a siege engines piling up outside of Camelot.

644
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,789
Speaker 0: You have to once in a while someone has to go out and destroy a bunch of them.

645
00:44:30,393 --> 00:44:32,770
Speaker 0: Meanwhile if too many of them appear Camelot be destroyed.

646
00:44:32,770 --> 00:44:43,044
Speaker 1: There's a good chance that one of the Knights sitting at King Arthur's table is in fact a traitor and he'll turn on Camelot and he'll start making siege engines and other evil stuff like that.

647
00:44:43,145 --> 00:44:46,118
Speaker 1: now the goal of the game is pretty cool Basically one there's.

648
00:44:46,138 --> 00:44:48,270
Speaker 1: there's a couple of ways where the game can just fuck you.

649
00:44:48,331 --> 00:44:49,189
Speaker 1: It's over you lose.

650
00:44:49,493 --> 00:45:03,250
Speaker 1: But other than that pretty much There are white swords and black swords and as you complete quest you get certain arbitrary numbers of white swords to place around King Arthur's table, but if you lose a quest you get black swords to place around King Arthur's table.

651
00:45:03,872 --> 00:45:05,396
Speaker 1: The majority wins in the end.

652
00:45:05,477 --> 00:45:12,384
Speaker 1: black swords majority the traitor if there is a traitor wins or else the board wins White swords everybody, but the traitor wins.

653
00:45:12,787 --> 00:45:21,501
Speaker 0: yep There might not be a traitor because there's actually the way the traitor works is that most there are seven players in the game and There are eight loyalty cards and one of them is the traitor.

654
00:45:21,541 --> 00:45:22,967
Speaker 0: so no one might be the traitor.

655
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:31,350
Speaker 1: now of course my brilliant idea Sometime if I'm running this game for people or I I know some people are gonna play intentionally leave the traitor card out.

656
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:32,612
Speaker 1: No even better.

657
00:45:32,692 --> 00:45:33,695
Speaker 0: put two traitor cards in.

658
00:45:33,876 --> 00:45:44,790
Speaker 1: I want to replace all the loyalty cards with traders and watch how the game progresses because it's Basically gonna be a bunch of players all thinking they're clever and wondering why no one has figured them out.

659
00:45:44,930 --> 00:45:48,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone's trying to do quests, but failing miserably at them on purpose.

660
00:45:48,660 --> 00:45:57,989
Speaker 0: They're sort of not doing them very well, and then you know Everyone sort of not caring and then How long it would go on before people realize what was going on?

661
00:45:58,410 --> 00:45:59,676
Speaker 1: I wonder if it would make it to the end.

662
00:45:59,696 --> 00:46:02,930
Speaker 0: the traitor element is really the only thing that keeps this game viable.

663
00:46:03,433 --> 00:46:09,339
Speaker 1: Yes, because I'll say this without the traitor Shadows over Camelot is worth playing at most.

664
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:10,643
Speaker 0: none twice nuns.

665
00:46:10,823 --> 00:46:13,310
Speaker 0: It's worth playing once I say without the traitor nuns.

666
00:46:13,672 --> 00:46:16,150
Speaker 1: I thought you have this weird thing against these sort of games.

667
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:17,525
Speaker 1: I think a lot of them are worth playing.

668
00:46:17,666 --> 00:46:22,507
Speaker 1: once Me I guess I mean see the Lord of the Rings game was really fun the first time.

669
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:23,370
Speaker 0: game is bad.

670
00:46:23,632 --> 00:46:24,277
Speaker 1: It was fun.

671
00:46:24,317 --> 00:46:25,850
Speaker 0: The rules are written even more from the words.

672
00:46:26,131 --> 00:46:27,658
Speaker 0: Yes, some of the worst rules I ever seen.

673
00:46:27,678 --> 00:46:32,339
Speaker 1: the only problem with that worse than Hellas I'd even say was that I was determined to beat.

674
00:46:32,359 --> 00:46:33,664
Speaker 1: I remember the day we beat that game.

675
00:46:33,986 --> 00:46:46,390
Speaker 1: I ran around screaming Anyway, anyway, so basically all that happens every night has a different power, you know Like Galahad can do something and Palmaties could do something else and King Arthur can do something else.

676
00:46:46,450 --> 00:46:49,359
Speaker 1: and like everyone has their special ability and their life bar.

677
00:46:49,901 --> 00:46:55,482
Speaker 1: and you start in King Arthur's Court and every round you can either draw white cards or Go off to a quest.

678
00:46:55,563 --> 00:46:58,990
Speaker 1: once you're at a quest You can't draw any more white cards till you go back to King Arthur's Court, right?

679
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:01,050
Speaker 0: And you sort of need white cards through the quest.

680
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:07,990
Speaker 0: So it's a game of go to the court draw a bunch of white cards take your white cards go out do a quest.

681
00:47:08,271 --> 00:47:10,700
Speaker 0: Hope you have the white cards to beat the quest or that you can.

682
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:29,911
Speaker 0: other things might happen like King Arthur can trade cards with you and such to beat the quest and when you beat the quest you get white swords and you get other goodies return Back to the court get some more white cards go out and do another quest and at the beginning of every person's turn They have to progress the evil somehow which means either they put a siege engine out there Yep,

683
00:47:30,212 --> 00:47:31,237
Speaker 1: they lose.

684
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:33,730
Speaker 1: a number of siege engines immediately ends the game, right?

685
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:40,192
Speaker 0: They lose health Can die you get a knight can die and sometimes a knight white might want to sacrifice Themselves.

686
00:47:40,233 --> 00:47:43,530
Speaker 0: if it means that everyone wins the game because it is a cooperative beat the game game.

687
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:53,410
Speaker 0: so if somehow you can beat the game by every night killing themselves except for one night because you know Hopefully not the traitor is the last guy because that is a victory condition for the traitor.

688
00:47:53,531 --> 00:48:02,449
Speaker 0: Yeah, if everyone's dead, but the traitor but if there's you know If you can kill everyone off and still win you win even if you're dead as long as there's one non traitor left alive.

689
00:48:04,312 --> 00:48:11,030
Speaker 0: Or you can draw a black card and a black card Pretty much makes evil happen and depending on the black card a different evil happens.

690
00:48:11,070 --> 00:48:12,337
Speaker 0: it might be a general evil.

691
00:48:12,377 --> 00:48:13,442
Speaker 0: that sort of fucks everyone.

692
00:48:13,462 --> 00:48:16,177
Speaker 0: it might be a Quest specific evil.

693
00:48:16,237 --> 00:48:22,624
Speaker 0: so, you know that you might draw a black knight card Which means you you one step closer to losing the black knight quest.

694
00:48:22,664 --> 00:48:32,629
Speaker 0: and if you draw a lot of black knight cards someone better go over to the black knight quest and you know complete it or else we're gonna lose it and We're gonna get some black swords, which is bad.

695
00:48:33,111 --> 00:48:41,459
Speaker 1: Now the strategy and the fun and everything in the game is pretty much that you have to juggle all of these quests among yourselves and Try to win the game.

696
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,010
Speaker 1: obviously, but the juggling is really important.

697
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:52,306
Speaker 1: I mean say some people are working on the Excalibur and some people are working on this and that and then it looks like Lancelot quest isn't going so well and no one's there.

698
00:48:52,326 --> 00:48:56,643
Speaker 1: Oh crap We got to do something or Lancelot's armor is gone forever or oh crap.

699
00:48:56,663 --> 00:48:57,627
Speaker 1: We're gonna lose the Holy Grail.

700
00:48:57,647 --> 00:48:58,270
Speaker 1: that fucks us.

701
00:48:58,651 --> 00:49:03,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's some quest mostly the Lancelot quest in the Holy Grail quest the Excalibur quest.

702
00:49:03,693 --> 00:49:15,130
Speaker 0: Yeah those three quests when if you succeed at those quests you get the Holy Grail or Excalibur or Lancelot's armor and if you get those they can help you out a lot.

703
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:19,826
Speaker 0: But if the trader gets those he can sort of fuck you over because he takes him out of the game and goes ha ha Yeah.

704
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:26,170
Speaker 1: And then all the other quests kind of repeat like the Saxons keep coming and keep coming and pretty much you let him build up.

705
00:49:26,471 --> 00:49:30,049
Speaker 1: But then you got to go deal with them because if they build up fully before you deal with them.

706
00:49:30,532 --> 00:49:33,830
Speaker 1: Well, they plopped out a bunch of siege engines and it's not good.

707
00:49:34,052 --> 00:49:35,569
Speaker 0: Think of it as sort of like it.

708
00:49:36,451 --> 00:49:40,870
Speaker 0: The game is sort of like you're in a boat that's taking on water and you have to keep bailing it out.

709
00:49:40,930 --> 00:49:45,090
Speaker 0: And if you can bail it out enough so that you can get to shore you win.

710
00:49:45,411 --> 00:49:53,630
Speaker 0: But if it sinks you lose and everyone's in this boat together Except there's one person on the boat who there might be a person on the boat who wants it to sink and they want everyone.

711
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:59,930
Speaker 1: The game is really really expertly balanced in that trader or no.

712
00:50:00,532 --> 00:50:13,090
Speaker 1: You will always pretty much it seems and people reading reports of other people playing confirm this You'll get real close to losing and then you'll either Fight and fight and fight and eventually lose or come back on strong and win.

713
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,561
Speaker 1: But the game always kind of really like.

714
00:50:15,601 --> 00:50:19,445
Speaker 1: you feel like you're always falling behind You're always falling down and you're losing and you're fucked.

715
00:50:19,485 --> 00:50:20,130
Speaker 1: and oh my god.

716
00:50:20,511 --> 00:50:26,390
Speaker 1: And like the the balance of the game in terms of drawing it out and the enjoyment is really really there.

717
00:50:26,410 --> 00:50:32,723
Speaker 0: Yeah As opposed to something like Arkham horror or the Lord of the Rings game We just kick your ass and make you feel like all this sucks.

718
00:50:32,764 --> 00:50:33,166
Speaker 0: This sucks.

719
00:50:33,206 --> 00:50:33,648
Speaker 0: This sucks.

720
00:50:34,992 --> 00:50:37,908
Speaker 0: Shadows over Camelot really feels kind of even you're never like.

721
00:50:37,928 --> 00:50:41,243
Speaker 0: yeah I'm kicking this game's ass cuz then it would be boring but you're never like.

722
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:42,830
Speaker 0: oh this sucks so bad.

723
00:50:42,951 --> 00:50:44,410
Speaker 0: It's just wasting my time.

724
00:50:44,510 --> 00:50:57,030
Speaker 1: The game does a good job of making you feel like you're completely fucked and you're about to lose and everything is falling down And yet you'll barely scrape by and then you'll win in the end with some big Everybody does something awesome and you win all of a sudden.

725
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,166
Speaker 0: I think it's really the way the game is abstracted is like you.

726
00:51:00,186 --> 00:51:00,370
Speaker 0: you know.

727
00:51:00,410 --> 00:51:08,850
Speaker 0: The quest will look like, you know, you look at the Holy Grail quest You see a bunch of black grails lined up and like oh despair despair and desolation, you know.

728
00:51:08,890 --> 00:51:12,590
Speaker 0: And then you'll see like a bunch of pigs coming in and you're like, oh the pigs is gonna be so bad.

729
00:51:12,690 --> 00:51:18,149
Speaker 0: But then you know you sort of play it through and if you're sort of suffering and you're hungry for cards You don't have enough cards.

730
00:51:18,472 --> 00:51:20,650
Speaker 0: Someone has to go back to Camelot to get more cards like.

731
00:51:21,732 --> 00:51:24,643
Speaker 0: But in the end you get like a bunch of white swords, maybe a couple black ones.

732
00:51:24,663 --> 00:51:27,161
Speaker 0: You're like, ah, I got it All right now.

733
00:51:27,222 --> 00:51:29,650
Speaker 1: in terms I mean there's special cars and all this sort of stuff.

734
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:42,450
Speaker 1: but the quest themselves are pretty much like go there and discard cards until you win or Go there with a full house and put it down and hope your numbers be the hand that the Black Knight's gonna head.

735
00:51:42,631 --> 00:51:48,016
Speaker 0: It's really a game of action management more and in addition to the card management In fact the action management more.

736
00:51:48,097 --> 00:51:51,130
Speaker 0: so like I was playing the character who could move for free, right?

737
00:51:51,230 --> 00:51:53,680
Speaker 0: So most people spend a turn moving to a quest.

738
00:51:53,761 --> 00:51:55,830
Speaker 0: I could just move to a quest and then get going right away.

739
00:51:56,211 --> 00:51:59,023
Speaker 0: So it saves me a whole turn which is huge or like me.

740
00:51:59,084 --> 00:52:00,530
Speaker 1: I was the Saracen Knight Palamides.

741
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:06,006
Speaker 0: So my land is Palamides Palamides Palamides Palamides Palamides like calamity.

742
00:52:06,026 --> 00:52:07,410
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, there's nay there.

743
00:52:07,711 --> 00:52:08,918
Speaker 1: All right, Palamides.

744
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,064
Speaker 1: Yes, you know what?

745
00:52:10,286 --> 00:52:17,308
Speaker 1: He's a Saracen I feel conflicted about But my power was that I can get life back and it was totally lame.

746
00:52:17,489 --> 00:52:18,734
Speaker 0: Yeah No, but you can.

747
00:52:19,235 --> 00:52:23,510
Speaker 0: so let's say this the grail quest right and we need let's say many ten grail cards to beat.

748
00:52:23,611 --> 00:52:24,749
Speaker 0: I've got ten grail cards.

749
00:52:24,830 --> 00:52:26,558
Speaker 0: Well, it takes me an action to go there.

750
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:34,410
Speaker 0: then I can play one card per turn But we might also be drawing evil grail cards that may basically, you know set us back.

751
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:34,953
Speaker 0: So it's not.

752
00:52:35,254 --> 00:52:52,537
Speaker 1: that's the thing that makes the game always feel on the edge of defeat that Like the way you draw these bad cards and kind of the allocation and the distribution in Short order a quest that you think you've got a handle on will suddenly spiral out of control and your moments from losing the grail And everyone's got to kind of pull together and buck up.

753
00:52:52,798 --> 00:52:53,018
Speaker 1: Yep.

754
00:52:53,620 --> 00:53:02,410
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the thing in this game is There's one major flaw and that is in the restrictions it puts on communication.

755
00:53:02,952 --> 00:53:05,561
Speaker 0: Let me give you an example this this is the I mean.

756
00:53:05,842 --> 00:53:14,590
Speaker 1: if nothing else I feel like this alone Takes an otherwise pretty serviceable game and a fun game and just ruins it for me, right?

757
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:17,658
Speaker 0: So let me let me try to explain that the flaw here.

758
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:22,395
Speaker 0: Let's say for example, it's my turn right on my turn I draw a black card.

759
00:53:22,435 --> 00:53:23,801
Speaker 0: Let's say it's a. I pick it up.

760
00:53:23,882 --> 00:53:25,690
Speaker 0: I look at I'm not supposed to show it to anyone.

761
00:53:26,431 --> 00:53:29,682
Speaker 0: Right, but these are all my teammates, but I'm not supposed to show them this card.

762
00:53:30,064 --> 00:53:33,394
Speaker 0: and the card says let's say it says black knight eight.

763
00:53:33,535 --> 00:53:35,480
Speaker 0: that's pretty bad because that means there's.

764
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,809
Speaker 0: I have to put this on the black knight and it's really strong.

765
00:53:38,829 --> 00:53:42,499
Speaker 0: and It means that if someone goes to fight the black knight say

766
00:53:42,539 --> 00:53:49,966
Speaker 1: rims already at the black knight and I've got like two threes down And you don't know what the what the other three cards I have that I'm gonna be playing on the

767
00:53:49,986 --> 00:53:51,834
Speaker 0: black knight only takes four Cards, whatever.

768
00:53:51,954 --> 00:53:58,922
Speaker 0: Anyway, so it that means that if rim doesn't have really high numbered fight cards He's gonna lose to the black knight because this is a really big number.

769
00:53:59,424 --> 00:54:03,317
Speaker 0: and if we're gonna lose to the black knight We're better off not wasting our turns fighting it.

770
00:54:03,337 --> 00:54:03,879
Speaker 0: We're gonna lose it.

771
00:54:03,959 --> 00:54:06,246
Speaker 1: Anyway, right but Scott, I mean one.

772
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:08,516
Speaker 1: I can't tell Scott What's in my hand?

773
00:54:08,697 --> 00:54:10,670
Speaker 0: No, he can't tell me what kind of fight cards.

774
00:54:10,750 --> 00:54:13,341
Speaker 1: So the care let's kind of have let's show you example of hope.

775
00:54:13,361 --> 00:54:14,747
Speaker 1: these bullshit conversations are so.

776
00:54:14,767 --> 00:54:15,450
Speaker 1: Scott draws the card.

777
00:54:15,490 --> 00:54:16,073
Speaker 1: He looks at it.

778
00:54:16,697 --> 00:54:19,210
Speaker 0: So I have to say it's a high one.

779
00:54:19,371 --> 00:54:20,921
Speaker 0: I'm not allowed to say if it's an eight.

780
00:54:21,001 --> 00:54:22,330
Speaker 0: I have to say it's high middle or low.

781
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:24,278
Speaker 0: That's all I'm allowed to say according to the rule book.

782
00:54:24,419 --> 00:54:25,764
Speaker 1: Yes to which I can say.

783
00:54:25,785 --> 00:54:30,025
Speaker 1: All right Do you think I can pull it off?

784
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:36,570
Speaker 1: I can't say That I've got three sixes in my hand left to go or two ones in my hand left to go are no sixes five.

785
00:54:36,590 --> 00:54:41,010
Speaker 1: I'm totally just making up numbers to prove a point But I can't say anything.

786
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:44,830
Speaker 1: I pretty much have to say well you think I can do it and he can't really answer that question.

787
00:54:44,891 --> 00:54:49,576
Speaker 1: He can pretty much say yeah, it's high Yeah, you can probably.

788
00:54:49,596 --> 00:54:53,449
Speaker 1: maybe and here's the deal everyone I ever see play this game.

789
00:54:54,092 --> 00:55:04,639
Speaker 1: they pretty much like people look at each other and signal and table talk and Basically break the rules with this Illusion or this nod to not breaking the rules.

790
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:11,019
Speaker 0: and here's the problem, right if you decide fuck the rules We're gonna say whatever we want because we're cooperating you.

791
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:14,330
Speaker 0: then the game becomes stupid because you just win.

792
00:55:14,490 --> 00:55:20,150
Speaker 0: There's no way to lose unless you're morons because everyone will know exactly what's on all what you know.

793
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,215
Speaker 0: All the cards are.

794
00:55:21,396 --> 00:55:23,830
Speaker 0: there's one person who has the secret ability.

795
00:55:24,111 --> 00:55:34,598
Speaker 0: They get to look at the next black card and decide whether to draw it or not and they can basically say Oh, it's bad, or it's not so bad or whatever, but if we know exactly what it is Then we like oh we can deal with that.

796
00:55:34,678 --> 00:55:36,647
Speaker 0: okay draw it or no we can't deal with that.

797
00:55:36,687 --> 00:55:37,190
Speaker 0: don't draw it.

798
00:55:37,330 --> 00:55:42,388
Speaker 0: I mean you basically what to do would be an obvious decision, and you'd win every time.

799
00:55:42,749 --> 00:55:44,634
Speaker 1: and It's not that they.

800
00:55:45,036 --> 00:55:51,009
Speaker 1: if they would have just banned a table talk and said you can't say shit Then the game would have been really good.

801
00:55:51,371 --> 00:55:52,875
Speaker 1: I've been okay, but here's the thing.

802
00:55:52,955 --> 00:56:06,594
Speaker 1: if they done that at least it wouldn't have been broken in this way where it's ambiguous As to what constitutes table talk ambiguous if you're breaking the rules or not and there's a lot of hinting and nodding and well Yeah, well don't play.

803
00:56:06,614 --> 00:56:08,580
Speaker 0: someone who like needs grail cards would be like.

804
00:56:08,681 --> 00:56:09,443
Speaker 0: I'm thirsty.

805
00:56:09,945 --> 00:56:10,767
Speaker 0: I'm thirsty.

806
00:56:10,807 --> 00:56:11,690
Speaker 1: That's bullshit.

807
00:56:11,810 --> 00:56:15,045
Speaker 1: That's the same as saying give me a grail card, which you're not allowed to say.

808
00:56:15,085 --> 00:56:16,230
Speaker 1: so why is saying I'm thirsty?

809
00:56:16,351 --> 00:56:18,001
Speaker 1: Okay, either it is or it isn't.

810
00:56:18,021 --> 00:56:22,450
Speaker 1: these ambiguous rules break the game They sure do, but if you don't let people table talk at all.

811
00:56:22,550 --> 00:56:26,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's say you made a rule where no one's allowed to talk No one's even allowed to communicate.

812
00:56:26,238 --> 00:56:28,390
Speaker 0: you play the game online, and there's no chat room.

813
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:29,475
Speaker 0: You can't even look at each other.

814
00:56:29,616 --> 00:56:36,146
Speaker 0: the odds of winning become very low if it becomes pretty much Impossible to win because how do you know who needs what you know?

815
00:56:36,206 --> 00:56:37,110
Speaker 0: King Arthur's pretty much?

816
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,053
Speaker 0: Just got a guess.

817
00:56:38,374 --> 00:56:42,109
Speaker 0: you know who to give what cards to the person who you know?

818
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,228
Speaker 0: Draws the black card doesn't look at looks at it and puts it back right.

819
00:56:46,429 --> 00:56:51,224
Speaker 0: well Maybe the next person you know has no idea if it's kind of okay, or really bad or whatever.

820
00:56:51,264 --> 00:56:53,390
Speaker 0: so they just draw it anyway.

821
00:56:53,430 --> 00:56:56,144
Speaker 0: No sudden really bad happened, and there's nothing we could have done about it.

822
00:56:56,164 --> 00:56:57,250
Speaker 0: We didn't have enough information.

823
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:58,800
Speaker 0: It's sort of like you know.

824
00:56:58,860 --> 00:57:04,002
Speaker 0: everyone's playing blindfolded again And the game becomes really stupid because you basically winning comes down to end luck.

825
00:57:04,142 --> 00:57:04,965
Speaker 1: the real problem.

826
00:57:04,985 --> 00:57:06,410
Speaker 1: Is that the developers of this game?

827
00:57:07,710 --> 00:57:21,530
Speaker 1: instead of coming up with an elegant solution to make the game balanced and fun and unambiguous and allow for the cooperative interaction That is so that makes the game fall so deliciously into acrimony every time it gets played.

828
00:57:22,172 --> 00:57:25,364
Speaker 1: I mean, that's that's the strength of the game that everyone bickers and yells and argues and all that.

829
00:57:25,424 --> 00:57:28,550
Speaker 0: but if they had been yeah That's the whole point of the traitor thing.

830
00:57:28,570 --> 00:57:30,723
Speaker 0: I mean how can you tell who's the traitor if there's no tabletop?

831
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:31,990
Speaker 1: and even if there aren't traitors?

832
00:57:32,330 --> 00:57:32,793
Speaker 1: There's the.

833
00:57:32,974 --> 00:57:35,510
Speaker 1: you know a knight is in charge of his own destiny.

834
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:39,665
Speaker 1: So the whole table can say rim go do the grail quest before we lose it.

835
00:57:39,745 --> 00:57:41,190
Speaker 1: I can say fuck you all.

836
00:57:41,451 --> 00:57:43,820
Speaker 1: I'm totally gonna finish the Arthur quest for this quest.

837
00:57:43,840 --> 00:57:46,490
Speaker 1: first the Lancelot quest because I think it's a better move.

838
00:57:47,052 --> 00:57:49,303
Speaker 1: I can do it, and they can't stop me even if I'm not the traitor.

839
00:57:49,343 --> 00:57:50,650
Speaker 1: I might just think I'm doing better.

840
00:57:50,932 --> 00:58:01,330
Speaker 1: Yep, but because it's ambiguous I feel as though the developers were lazy and Decided not to bother coming up with some sort of elegant solution and just came up with this half-assed half-measure.

841
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:05,950
Speaker 0: What they should have done is they should have come up with a very specific list of things you may and may not say.

842
00:58:06,050 --> 00:58:12,210
Speaker 0: Like, you know when you draw a black card, you can say either good bad or neutral.

843
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,617
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to say anything else.

844
00:58:13,858 --> 00:58:21,690
Speaker 0: or when you draw, you know When you want a card from King Arthur you can you know, basically say I would like a card.

845
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:29,250
Speaker 1: Or maybe you have a hand of like six semi generic statements and you're allowed to reveal one on your turn.

846
00:58:29,471 --> 00:58:31,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like on your turn, you know, they're.

847
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:33,350
Speaker 0: they're like say six communication cards.

848
00:58:33,551 --> 00:58:38,708
Speaker 0: you can have any one of them face up at any time like you can give one to a player like like.

849
00:58:38,749 --> 00:58:45,999
Speaker 1: maybe one Says you're proper fucked and one says oh shit's the grail And no one's allowed to talk or communicate in any way.

850
00:58:46,079 --> 00:58:49,950
Speaker 0: otherwise no signaling no gesturing no winking no talking.

851
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:55,670
Speaker 0: And then that you know would sort of solve the problem because you wouldn't have the no communication making the game boring.

852
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:56,814
Speaker 0: You know not.

853
00:58:56,935 --> 00:59:01,030
Speaker 0: you know less to go on to figure who's the traitor and you know stupidity and losing.

854
00:59:01,471 --> 00:59:05,361
Speaker 0: But you wouldn't also have the open vague communication that makes the game easy and you just win.

855
00:59:05,382 --> 00:59:12,890
Speaker 1: I feel as though the this Ambiguity of table talk alone takes this game and ruins it.

856
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:18,108
Speaker 0: It sure does completely otherwise an okay game because he's okay for a beat.

857
00:59:18,128 --> 00:59:21,981
Speaker 1: the game game Despite the busted rule in that regard and all that other stuff.

858
00:59:22,001 --> 00:59:22,624
Speaker 1: We talked about.

859
00:59:23,447 --> 00:59:24,330
Speaker 1: I don't want to be unfair.

860
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:30,090
Speaker 1: The game is really fun for a couple of plays and this is a great party game.

861
00:59:30,130 --> 00:59:40,249
Speaker 1: this is a great game if you if you were hardcore into games and you have a lot of friends who aren't if They're all over and you bust out this game and you teach it to a real quick and just run with it.

862
00:59:40,932 --> 00:59:47,353
Speaker 1: It's a riot for people who aren't really really into board gaming and it's really fun for people who are into board gaming if you Only play it once or twice.

863
00:59:47,513 --> 00:59:59,583
Speaker 0: the other problem with this game right is even if you you know play by all the communication rules you know really strictly and such if Everyone playing is like an expert and knows all the rules and knows how to play.

864
00:59:59,603 --> 01:00:04,640
Speaker 0: It's pretty much Impossible to lose unless the traitor is super super.

865
01:00:04,700 --> 01:00:07,228
Speaker 0: now this is your luck is really really bad.

866
01:00:07,409 --> 01:00:08,996
Speaker 1: one thing That's very good about this game.

867
01:00:09,036 --> 01:00:10,041
Speaker 1: I like this mechanic.

868
01:00:10,503 --> 01:00:13,071
Speaker 1: I mean we see this mechanic in Verator.

869
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:30,970
Speaker 1: yeah, and we see this mechanic here the idea of a traitor and in this game The traitor is what saves it because if you play with expert players the traitor is the one thing that makes it possible for the game to be enjoyable among people who know the rules of the Game and are good at the game in the future.

870
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:34,241
Speaker 0: Yeah, if there was no traitor then expert players would win every time.

871
01:00:34,321 --> 01:00:38,316
Speaker 0: even if it is a limited communication one It's a great party game.

872
01:00:38,377 --> 01:00:43,279
Speaker 1: Just like at a casual party whip it out play it especially if people are drinking a little bit the game will get really fun.

873
01:00:43,319 --> 01:00:44,263
Speaker 1: people really get into it.

874
01:00:44,625 --> 01:01:02,580
Speaker 1: my role play a little bit or Find a group of seven people and play This game like once a month with the same group of seven people every time because then the traitor aspect it turns into a complex mafia and That could save the game But only if you like the game.

875
01:01:02,600 --> 01:01:03,770
Speaker 1: if you don't like the game don't try that.

876
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:08,768
Speaker 1: But if if you think the game has potential and you're not put off by the table-talk aspects.

877
01:01:08,788 --> 01:01:12,930
Speaker 1: We've brought up That's how to save this game and make it playable in the long run.

878
01:01:13,492 --> 01:01:15,800
Speaker 0: The other thing is the game is a really high production quality.

879
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:20,818
Speaker 0: the boards are nice the cards are nice the box is nice The cards are real miniatures are nice.

880
01:01:20,918 --> 01:01:22,223
Speaker 0: all the pieces are pretty good.

881
01:01:22,263 --> 01:01:24,150
Speaker 1: though that thing that looks like an experience.

882
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:26,881
Speaker 0: Yes, I gotta tell you this there is an expansion for this game.

883
01:01:27,584 --> 01:01:28,990
Speaker 0: It's not really an expansion.

884
01:01:29,151 --> 01:01:32,050
Speaker 1: It's not what you think it is basically in the game.

885
01:01:32,150 --> 01:01:33,957
Speaker 0: They're miniatures for each night right.

886
01:01:33,977 --> 01:01:37,230
Speaker 0: there's one for King Arthur and one for everyone else, but they're not painted.

887
01:01:38,011 --> 01:01:41,104
Speaker 0: They sell something that looks like an expansion to shadows over Camelot.

888
01:01:41,125 --> 01:01:44,598
Speaker 0: That's actually just Replacements for all the night miniatures.

889
01:01:44,919 --> 01:01:51,670
Speaker 0: They're exactly the same as the ones that come with the game only they're painted And they're not painted that well either and they charge money for this.

890
01:01:51,891 --> 01:01:52,875
Speaker 1: It's pretty sad.

891
01:01:52,936 --> 01:01:58,106
Speaker 0: don't buy it by accident unless you need like replacement pieces Which I highly doubt because they're kind of hard to lose.

892
01:01:58,247 --> 01:02:03,850
Speaker 0: yes I think there might actually be other real expansions for the game, but I haven't looked into them.

893
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:07,769
Speaker 0: And I don't like additional quests, but I haven't looked into that and I don't really know so much.

894
01:02:08,271 --> 01:02:08,893
Speaker 1: It's it's a good.

895
01:02:09,114 --> 01:02:09,555
Speaker 1: I mean.

896
01:02:09,575 --> 01:02:14,330
Speaker 1: This is a good game for one person in your circle of gaming friends to own yep.

897
01:02:14,512 --> 01:02:16,089
Speaker 1: It's a good game to whip out of parties.

898
01:02:16,492 --> 01:02:18,784
Speaker 1: It's a good game to go hardcore into with the trader.

899
01:02:19,387 --> 01:02:25,402
Speaker 1: other than that It's kind of meh and most of the mehs from one Unless unless you like beat the game games.

900
01:02:25,704 --> 01:02:34,650
Speaker 1: It is a beat the game game And if you don't like that sort of thing you won't like it and to The table talk thing really really hurts it a lot it does.

901
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:39,590
Speaker 0: It's pretty painful because you either feel like you're cheating or you feel like it's bullshit.

902
01:02:40,271 --> 01:02:48,950
Speaker 1: Despite that the time we played it with the crew was really fun because one Pete was totally the traitor and did a good job right up until the end and - he didn't trade her enough.

903
01:02:48,990 --> 01:03:03,728
Speaker 1: He could have done a lot more damage, but - Scott here It was probably the first time in my life that he's complimented me because basically what he said was Rim has to be the traitor because rim has been playing kind of poorly.

904
01:03:03,969 --> 01:03:05,714
Speaker 1: therefore He's obviously the traitor.

905
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:09,285
Speaker 1: and when everyone said what the fuck Scott why he said it's rim.

906
01:03:09,546 --> 01:03:10,349
Speaker 1: It's a board game.

907
01:03:10,569 --> 01:03:11,322
Speaker 1: the fuck Do you think?

908
01:03:14,672 --> 01:03:20,234
Speaker 0: Because I mean I was looking at what you had and I was like if I had that I would not be doing such shit Like that.

909
01:03:20,616 --> 01:03:24,793
Speaker 0: you know and if you're doing shit moves that were obviously Shit moves.

910
01:03:25,074 --> 01:03:31,301
Speaker 1: see the thing is see having seen my full hand and not cheating and table-talking I was doing the best moves I could be doing.

911
01:03:31,321 --> 01:03:35,276
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah anyway But yeah, that's all we got to say about that.

912
01:03:35,316 --> 01:03:39,548
Speaker 1: in general beat the game games are World of Warcraft without the leveling.

913
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:42,001
Speaker 1: yep I mean that's pretty much it.

914
01:03:42,343 --> 01:03:45,049
Speaker 1: if you like doing raids You'll like beat the game games.

915
01:03:45,311 --> 01:03:52,060
Speaker 1: But like raids once you've done a raid a couple of times And you know how to beat it beat the game games are no longer fun.

916
01:03:52,140 --> 01:03:58,294
Speaker 0: and beat the game games are actually very similar to say jigsaw puzzles or cooperative games.

917
01:03:58,636 --> 01:04:00,562
Speaker 0: yeah, well I mean they're cooperative.

918
01:04:00,583 --> 01:04:03,394
Speaker 0: the thing is they're cooperative games such as Dracula.

919
01:04:03,414 --> 01:04:14,680
Speaker 0: right but even though it's four against one It's actually not a beat the game game because it's actually a human being on the other end whereas in say Arkham horror There's no human being on the other end.

920
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:19,506
Speaker 0: thing is set by the cards and thus puzzle on a core level.

921
01:04:19,546 --> 01:04:25,089
Speaker 1: that doesn't At least for the it for Dracula and a lot of these games that doesn't really mean anything.

922
01:04:25,330 --> 01:04:32,652
Speaker 0: It means that there's actually a psychology to it and a different answer each time that is set by a human being rather than a set Answer.

923
01:04:32,672 --> 01:04:36,570
Speaker 1: well the thing is the set answer is still randomized by cards and things and shadows of her camera.

924
01:04:36,612 --> 01:04:41,759
Speaker 1: It Procedure it adds depth and complexity.

925
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,594
Speaker 1: yep now granted Dracula fails on a number of fronts I sure does.

926
01:04:45,674 --> 01:04:50,476
Speaker 1: it does not fail on the front that I always feel like I want to play it even though I realize I Don't after I'm playing it.

927
01:04:50,657 --> 01:04:50,778
Speaker 0: Yeah.

928
01:04:50,818 --> 01:04:50,899
Speaker 0: Well.

929
01:04:50,939 --> 01:04:54,957
Speaker 0: It's mostly that the combat sucks, but the Dracula's hidden movement is awesome.

930
01:04:55,459 --> 01:04:55,680
Speaker 1: Yes.

931
01:04:55,740 --> 01:04:56,583
Speaker 0: It is all right.

932
01:04:56,924 --> 01:04:57,145
Speaker 0: All right.

933
01:04:57,185 --> 01:04:58,370
