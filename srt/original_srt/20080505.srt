1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,185
Speaker 0: It's Monday, May 5th.

2
00:00:11,767 --> 00:00:12,409
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:13,111
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:13,573
Speaker 1: Sneezy.

5
00:00:14,235 --> 00:00:15,800
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights!

6
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,760
Speaker 0: Tonight, the amazing, world-changing, memory store.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

8
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:37,680
Speaker 1: So, uh, it being another Visigothic weekend, we had to go out for dinner as we do, and we always kind of go to the same places.

9
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:43,760
Speaker 1: Like up, we go to the Cafe Maya, we go to the whatever, and we wanted to eat something different.

10
00:00:45,447 --> 00:00:46,439
Speaker 0: What can we eat different here?

11
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:51,497
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, there's fancy expensive places, but we don't want to go get like a $40 dinner every weekend.

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,620
Speaker 1: That really doesn't work so well.

13
00:00:53,801 --> 00:00:54,339
Speaker 0: No, not really.

14
00:00:54,801 --> 00:01:06,420
Speaker 1: And there's one restaurant, one kind of food, that we ate a lot in Rochester, but we don't eat so much in Beacon, because while there is a restaurant that serves it, we have had a somewhat colored history with this restaurant.

15
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:07,820
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, I know what you're going to talk about.

16
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,467
Speaker 1: The Sukhothai in Beacon.

17
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:10,413
Speaker 1: It's Thai food.

18
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:11,359
Speaker 1: It's pretty good Thai food.

19
00:01:12,162 --> 00:01:12,666
Speaker 0: It's okay.

20
00:01:12,706 --> 00:01:14,360
Speaker 0: It's not as good as the King and I in Rochester.

21
00:01:15,423 --> 00:01:17,179
Speaker 0: Get that garlic pepper beef, oh man.

22
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,260
Speaker 1: And it doesn't really hold a candle to anything in the city.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:24,480
Speaker 0: And then you would get the garlic pepper chicken, and then we would both basically get garlic pepper beef chicken.

24
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,899
Speaker 1: We'd also get like four or five meats on sticks.

25
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:28,420
Speaker 1: But that was just a given.

26
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:29,237
Speaker 0: You mean satay?

27
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,440
Speaker 1: Meat on stick for the uninitiated.

28
00:01:31,748 --> 00:01:31,960
Speaker 0: Correct.

29
00:01:32,622 --> 00:01:33,980
Speaker 1: It's meat on a stick.

30
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,560
Speaker 0: I love meat on a stick, let me tell you.

31
00:01:36,022 --> 00:01:39,560
Speaker 0: If there is any way to eat meat, on a stick is probably the second best way to eat meat.

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:50,858
Speaker 1: But you see, a while ago, we'd sworn off the Sukhothai because we'd gone one time with a group of like six or seven people, and I walked in and I said, "Hey, how long is the wait for

33
00:01:50,898 --> 00:01:51,160
Speaker 1: seven?".

34
00:01:51,423 --> 00:01:52,255
Speaker 1: And the guy said, "Just a

35
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:52,458
Speaker 1: minute.".

36
00:01:54,102 --> 00:01:55,619
Speaker 1: And like 10 minutes go by.

37
00:01:56,281 --> 00:01:59,855
Speaker 1: So I go back up and say, "Hey, how long is the wait going to be?

38
00:01:59,875 --> 00:02:00,618
Speaker 1: I've already been here like 10

39
00:02:00,618 --> 00:02:00,920
Speaker 1: minutes.".

40
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:01,774
Speaker 1: He says, "Just a

41
00:02:01,795 --> 00:02:01,978
Speaker 1: minute.".

42
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:03,362
Speaker 1: "All

43
00:02:03,383 --> 00:02:03,609
Speaker 1: right.".

44
00:02:04,102 --> 00:02:05,140
Speaker 1: This repeats for a while.

45
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:08,259
Speaker 1: Finally, we say, "Screw it," and just walk out and eat at the place across the street.

46
00:02:09,181 --> 00:02:12,680
Speaker 1: We go back like a month later and the same thing happens.

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,040
Speaker 1: So we swore the place off, just terrible service, and the price was not-.

48
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,780
Speaker 0: We've eaten there successfully a few times, but not recently.

49
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:27,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I don't know if it's under new management or I don't know what the deal is, but we've been getting our Thai food in the city instead, where it's much better anyway.

50
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,008
Speaker 1: But this weekend, we decided, "You know what?

51
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,775
Speaker 1: We all really want Thai food.

52
00:02:32,477 --> 00:02:33,220
Speaker 1: Let's chance

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,280
Speaker 1: it.".

54
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,500
Speaker 1: And if we fail, there's that good Italian place right across the street.

55
00:02:38,364 --> 00:02:41,220
Speaker 1: So Emily and I went ahead to try to get a table.

56
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:51,180
Speaker 1: And as we're walking in, there was a portent, you see, or a car slowed and it was full of punk kids, like punkology kids.

57
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,972
Speaker 1: Window rolls down and they yell, "Fuck you, Sukhothai!

58
00:02:56,554 --> 00:02:57,296
Speaker 1: Fuck you!

59
00:02:57,717 --> 00:02:58,138
Speaker 1: Fuck you,

60
00:02:58,218 --> 00:02:58,800
Speaker 1: Sukhothai!".

61
00:02:59,043 --> 00:02:59,958
Speaker 1: And then they speed off.

62
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:05,680
Speaker 0: See, now the question is, were they just in general saying, "Fuck you" to everything they passed?

63
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,280
Speaker 0: Or were they specifically targeting the Sukhothai?

64
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:19,800
Speaker 1: It was definitely a specific Sukhothai target, because they drove up, slowed down to a stop pretty much outside of the Sukhothai, called it out by name, then rolled up the window and continued.

65
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:22,860
Speaker 0: There's a story there somewhere.

66
00:03:23,383 --> 00:03:24,840
Speaker 1: I'm sure there is, so whatever.

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,216
Speaker 1: Emily and I go in, I say, "How long's the wait for

68
00:03:28,216 --> 00:03:29,142
Speaker 1: 9?".

69
00:03:29,142 --> 00:03:30,553
Speaker 1: And the woman says, "Just a

70
00:03:30,593 --> 00:03:30,875
Speaker 1: minute.".

71
00:03:31,762 --> 00:03:36,038
Speaker 1: And I say, "Well, just a minute before I get a table, or just a minute before you tell me along the way it

72
00:03:36,078 --> 00:03:36,139
Speaker 1: is.".

73
00:03:36,421 --> 00:03:37,107
Speaker 1: And she says, "Just a

74
00:03:37,148 --> 00:03:37,350
Speaker 1: minute.".

75
00:03:38,704 --> 00:03:39,236
Speaker 1: "It's all

76
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:39,400
Speaker 1: right.".

77
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:41,171
Speaker 1: I say, "All right, I'll be standing outside.

78
00:03:41,211 --> 00:03:42,419
Speaker 1: Will you come get me when you

79
00:03:42,459 --> 00:03:42,600
Speaker 1: know?".

80
00:03:42,721 --> 00:03:43,067
Speaker 1: And she said,

81
00:03:43,087 --> 00:03:43,270
Speaker 1: "Yeah.".

82
00:03:44,061 --> 00:03:46,819
Speaker 1: So I go outside, we wait a while, I walk back in.

83
00:03:48,004 --> 00:03:49,493
Speaker 1: "Hey, so can I get a table?

84
00:03:49,594 --> 00:03:49,835
Speaker 1: Just a

85
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:50,077
Speaker 1: minute.".

86
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:52,653
Speaker 1: "All right, are you going to give us a table or

87
00:03:52,713 --> 00:03:53,015
Speaker 1: not?".

88
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:55,529
Speaker 1: "Let me talk to the

89
00:03:55,550 --> 00:03:55,914
Speaker 1: manager.".

90
00:03:56,722 --> 00:03:59,019
Speaker 1: Manager comes over and I'm like, "Hey, how long's the

91
00:03:59,059 --> 00:03:59,140
Speaker 1: wait?".

92
00:03:59,221 --> 00:04:00,189
Speaker 1: No one seems to be able to tell me.

93
00:04:00,209 --> 00:04:01,440
Speaker 1: I got 9 people, we're hungry.

94
00:04:02,004 --> 00:04:03,395
Speaker 1: And he says, "Oh, whoa, whoa, just a

95
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:03,637
Speaker 1: minute.".

96
00:04:04,405 --> 00:04:05,319
Speaker 1: And then he walks away.

97
00:04:06,421 --> 00:04:08,215
Speaker 1: To which I say, "All right, screw

98
00:04:08,275 --> 00:04:08,477
Speaker 1: this.".

99
00:04:09,383 --> 00:04:12,300
Speaker 1: We went across the street and I got some lobster ravioli instead.

100
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:14,109
Speaker 0: "Sukotai in Beacon, New York.

101
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:15,075
Speaker 0: Do not eat there.

102
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:15,398
Speaker 0: Ever.".

103
00:04:16,021 --> 00:04:19,779
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's that they don't like large parties, but that's not it.

104
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,516
Speaker 1: Because there was a party of 11 already in there.

105
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:24,900
Speaker 0: It looked like that was a reserved party that had a reservation.

106
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,420
Speaker 0: But, you know, still, they definitely don't mind a large party.

107
00:04:29,001 --> 00:04:35,619
Speaker 1: But I think maybe they just don't like young people because there were, I realized, there were no parties of young people in that place.

108
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:37,553
Speaker 1: But it has been a coincidence.

109
00:04:37,695 --> 00:04:38,059
Speaker 1: I don't know.

110
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:39,487
Speaker 1: It's not like that time.

111
00:04:39,527 --> 00:04:46,840
Speaker 1: Scott and I went to the Italian place in Fishkill where I was dressed like a hobo and we looked like people who could not afford to be eating there.

112
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they let us in.

113
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:48,734
Speaker 0: They fed us.

114
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:54,200
Speaker 0: We went to this fancy $40 steak place not dressed up at all and they fed us.

115
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,360
Speaker 1: I was wearing shorts and a scuzzy old webcomic t-shirt.

116
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,779
Speaker 0: I was wearing shorts and a t-shirt and they totally fed us and they filled my water far too often.

117
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:07,440
Speaker 1: Though when we went to that place when I was dressed like a hobo, they let us in and they served us.

118
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:11,240
Speaker 1: But I remember they looked at me a little bit odd when I ordered wine.

119
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, "How much for the

120
00:05:13,234 --> 00:05:13,678
Speaker 0: girls?".

121
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,487
Speaker 1: "Ha, you're weaving.

122
00:05:14,508 --> 00:05:15,074
Speaker 0: How much for the

123
00:05:15,115 --> 00:05:15,358
Speaker 0: women?".

124
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,175
Speaker 0: "How much for the

125
00:05:16,215 --> 00:05:16,338
Speaker 0: women?".

126
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,227
Speaker 1: "I want to buy your women.

127
00:05:17,247 --> 00:05:17,973
Speaker 1: Your wife, your little

128
00:05:18,013 --> 00:05:18,315
Speaker 1: girl.".

129
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:20,140
Speaker 0: Alright.

130
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,040
Speaker 1: So yeah, we'll talk about the Visigoth thing on Tuesday where it's more relevant.

131
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:25,440
Speaker 0: So I bought my new computer.

132
00:05:25,963 --> 00:05:26,599
Speaker 1: Yes, you did.

133
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:29,140
Speaker 0: And we had that old, we had a server that died, right?

134
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:32,600
Speaker 0: And I had my old computer which still worked, right?

135
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:42,120
Speaker 0: So I said, "You know, I'll combine the server that died and my old computer that still works and make a working computer and that will be the new server because I really need a DNS server.

136
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,777
Speaker 0: It's really hard to do web development without some sort of

137
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:45,179
Speaker 0: DNS.".

138
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:54,200
Speaker 1: Now something must have happened because the equation, I think what you intended was broken computer plus working computer equals better computer.

139
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:57,331
Speaker 1: But instead, you got working computer times.

140
00:05:57,411 --> 00:06:00,020
Speaker 1: broken computer equals all broken computers.

141
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:01,503
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

142
00:06:01,523 --> 00:06:07,180
Speaker 0: I mean, it's sort of one of those situations where the parts, I'm pretty sure, still work.

143
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:14,120
Speaker 0: But like if you screw the motherboard into the case, then the case sort of touches the motherboard in a bad way.

144
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,160
Speaker 0: It's a bad touch, if you will.

145
00:06:17,606 --> 00:06:18,380
Speaker 1: I need an adult.

146
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,704
Speaker 0: It's a bad touch.

147
00:06:19,724 --> 00:06:22,196
Speaker 0: The motherboard is, "Where did he touch you,

148
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:22,779
Speaker 0: motherboard?".

149
00:06:24,243 --> 00:06:27,079
Speaker 1: It was Scott Johnson and he had this sweater on.

150
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:33,160
Speaker 0: Because if I take the motherboard out of the case and I rest it on a static bag and boot it, it works.

151
00:06:33,880 --> 00:06:42,880
Speaker 0: So I just got to screw it into the case in a very careful way where everything's lined up nicely, only touching the good places, and then it will boot properly.

152
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:48,510
Speaker 0: If I don't, it goes, "Dee doo doo," which is very annoying.

153
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:52,670
Speaker 1: Of course, you know, my old computer, Shazar, did that whenever it overheated.

154
00:06:53,092 --> 00:06:56,650
Speaker 1: And I think you remember that I solved that pretty handily by unplugging the PC speaker.

155
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:02,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, but I've got, the thing is, right, I'm going to get this computer working somehow.

156
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:05,509
Speaker 0: Alex also has some parts, so we can combine those two.

157
00:07:06,071 --> 00:07:09,850
Speaker 0: But I've got a lot of extra parts for computers.

158
00:07:11,312 --> 00:07:14,909
Speaker 0: And some of them, I like to have extra parts, so I don't want to get rid of all of them.

159
00:07:15,392 --> 00:07:18,690
Speaker 0: But some of them are working, but just not necessary.

160
00:07:18,811 --> 00:07:26,310
Speaker 0: Like, I do not need three 300-watt power supplies when I only have, like, two computers that could possibly use them.

161
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:27,415
Speaker 1: We're going to have more.

162
00:07:27,435 --> 00:07:35,310
Speaker 1: I have that other power supply that wouldn't work with my motherboard, but it's otherwise fine, and I'm buying a new power supply just because the one I have now is loud.

163
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:49,650
Speaker 0: I still have my first computer that was mine personally, my 8-bit BX6 R2 motherboard with the Pentium 3450 Slot 1 CPU in it, and I have RAM for it, and that is the most reliable computer in the known universe.

164
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,549
Speaker 0: And it still works, I'm sure.

165
00:07:52,590 --> 00:08:00,450
Speaker 0: But I have no use for it unless I really want to make a DOS computer, but we have DOSBox now, the piece of software DOSBox, so it's really not necessary.

166
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:07,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was a time when anyone who would really consider themselves a PC gamer kept around an old Pentium box to play DOS games.

167
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:10,341
Speaker 1: But that technology, we have averted that.

168
00:08:10,381 --> 00:08:12,490
Speaker 1: We no longer need these old, archaic devices.

169
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:20,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't know what DOSBox is, if you install old DOS games in Steam, like, say, Doom, it uses DOSBox to make those games work.

170
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, or if you're hardcore, DOS EMU.

171
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,860
Speaker 0: That's stupid hardcore.

172
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:26,230
Speaker 0: Unnecessarily hardcore, in fact.

173
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:30,225
Speaker 0: But yeah, so I'm just having a little trouble putting some computers together.

174
00:08:30,265 --> 00:08:31,230
Speaker 0: We'll see how this goes.

175
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:44,169
Speaker 0: But I'm going to try to find, because I know there's those places that just take donations of old computer parts and then sort of do what I'm doing and make working computers and give them to people who don't have computers and teach them how to use them.

176
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:49,549
Speaker 1: You should just give them all to Scott Johnson, because he has a collection of networking computers that would rival many museums.

177
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:51,409
Speaker 0: But he doesn't do anything with them.

178
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:52,990
Speaker 1: Well, he slowly builds computers.

179
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:57,050
Speaker 0: He should open up one of those places that takes donations and builds computers and gives them to people.

180
00:08:57,491 --> 00:08:58,998
Speaker 0: Those places are actually really cool.

181
00:08:59,018 --> 00:09:01,570
Speaker 0: I don't know if there's one nearby us, but I know there's one in California.

182
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:02,673
Speaker 0: I saw a video about it.

183
00:09:03,115 --> 00:09:07,830
Speaker 0: And basically, they take you in, right, and they collect parts from donations.

184
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:09,478
Speaker 0: They take people in.

185
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,990
Speaker 0: The people test parts to see if they work or not.

186
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:14,570
Speaker 0: And the people learn how to build a computer.

187
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:19,690
Speaker 0: And the deal is, you come in, you build X number of computers, and you get to keep one.

188
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:23,890
Speaker 0: And then the other computers go to people who need computers who don't have them.

189
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,950
Speaker 0: And they just build really crappy but working computers.

190
00:09:27,292 --> 00:09:28,330
Speaker 1: Which is fine for grandma.

191
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,055
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's great for grandma.

192
00:09:30,156 --> 00:09:33,810
Speaker 0: It's also great for homeless guy and also great for crazy guy.

193
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:40,810
Speaker 1: Oh man, speaking of fine for grandma, I got to burn a nice Ubuntu CD because Red Hat workstation, not cutting it.

194
00:09:41,133 --> 00:09:42,109
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

195
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:45,090
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I had the pleasure of talking to Red Hat Enterprise Support.

196
00:09:46,313 --> 00:09:47,830
Speaker 0: Wow, you have to pay for that.

197
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:52,929
Speaker 1: Well, back when I worked at IBM, we had Red Hat Support, and I never got anything out of them.

198
00:09:53,590 --> 00:09:56,139
Speaker 1: And sure enough, I can't get any useful information.

199
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,370
Speaker 1: They don't really offer support, as far as I can tell.

200
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:00,709
Speaker 0: What are you paying for?

201
00:10:00,991 --> 00:10:01,572
Speaker 0: I don't know.

202
00:10:02,555 --> 00:10:07,529
Speaker 1: This is an experiment, so I think my next test is going to be, "Will Ubuntu

203
00:10:07,569 --> 00:10:07,710
Speaker 1: boot?"

204
00:10:09,091 --> 00:10:11,225
Speaker 1: Followed by, "Look everybody, Ubuntu is

205
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:11,567
Speaker 1: better.".

206
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:17,430
Speaker 0: And another thing, right, is I have two 17-inch monitors on my desk that I'm using with the new computer.

207
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:24,490
Speaker 1: Scott bought those things back when you could not use LCDs for gaming, unless you bought the one that Scott had.

208
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:29,250
Speaker 0: Way back in the day, right, if you wanted an LCD monitor and you wanted to play games, it was impossible.

209
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:47,410
Speaker 0: I mean, it worked, but you would get this ghosting effect because the refresh rates of the monitor were so slow that, like, it would draw, like, if you were moving left and right in an FPS, just like aim to the left, aim to the right, it wouldn't erase fully the gun on the left before it drew it on the right.

210
00:10:47,551 --> 00:10:48,005
Speaker 1: It was awful.

211
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,099
Speaker 0: So everything was, like, had this ghost.

212
00:10:50,159 --> 00:10:52,370
Speaker 0: It was, like, you could see the ghost of your former self.

213
00:10:52,410 --> 00:10:57,690
Speaker 0: Like, if a bad guy moved, you could see where he just was and where he was now, and it really sucked.

214
00:10:58,232 --> 00:11:03,070
Speaker 0: And then eventually they got the monitors to a point where they had a 12-millisecond refresh rate.

215
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,190
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the line.

216
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,076
Speaker 0: That's the line.

217
00:11:05,116 --> 00:11:06,670
Speaker 0: It's, like, 12 milliseconds.

218
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:12,030
Speaker 0: Now there's no ghosting when you play an FPS at 75 frames per second, right?

219
00:11:12,794 --> 00:11:13,829
Speaker 0: So I was, like, hot shit.

220
00:11:14,370 --> 00:11:17,190
Speaker 0: And so I went, and it was also, it's a really nice monitor.

221
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:23,410
Speaker 0: Like, it can adjust in all different directions, and it would, like, there's barely any plastic around the screen itself.

222
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:29,290
Speaker 0: I hate that when there's, like, a monitor, and then around the monitor there's all this plastic or speakers or any other shit like that.

223
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:30,749
Speaker 1: That's why I'm really liking these.

224
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,809
Speaker 1: Dell is rocking with the wide screens.

225
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,520
Speaker 0: Dell has conquered the monitor world.

226
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:35,870
Speaker 0: Like, ViewSonic is down the shitter.

227
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:38,589
Speaker 0: But anyway, so I have two.

228
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,970
Speaker 0: I bought the first one when it was $500.

229
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,770
Speaker 0: I think it might have been $550.

230
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,830
Speaker 0: So that was poor at RIT, relatively poor anyway.

231
00:11:46,351 --> 00:11:49,864
Speaker 0: I got a Samsung 17-inch LCD, the 172X, famous monitor.

232
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:55,706
Speaker 0: In those days, everyone, if you said what monitor do I buy, everyone said 172X.

233
00:11:57,270 --> 00:12:01,568
Speaker 0: And then later on, I bought another 172X, like, right before they were discontinued.

234
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:08,810
Speaker 1: Now this presented a problem, because then Scott realized that his one he'd had for so long had a little bit of a problem with the backlight.

235
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,292
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

236
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:12,930
Speaker 0: It's like I turned the new one on, and the old one I thought was just fine.

237
00:12:13,031 --> 00:12:16,090
Speaker 0: But turning the new one on, it was, like, twice as bright as the old one.

238
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:22,350
Speaker 0: Now I don't know if they maybe made changes to it along the production process, or if I damaged the backlight or something.

239
00:12:22,350 --> 00:12:26,390
Speaker 0: Because it has even lighting, it's just as dim lighting compared to the newer one.

240
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:30,950
Speaker 0: So now I have a bright 17-inch LCD and a dim 17-inch LCD, but they both work.

241
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,654
Speaker 0: They both work well enough to see.

242
00:12:33,055 --> 00:12:38,430
Speaker 0: One just has unreliable color, and is only good for a side monitor, not a primary monitor.

243
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:44,210
Speaker 0: And I've had these two monitors for a while, and I feel really bad replacing them, because they cost so much money.

244
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:49,183
Speaker 0: But a Dell UltraSharp 20-inch widescreen is $250, which makes me feel terrible.

245
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,650
Speaker 1: You know, you could just use three monitors.

246
00:12:55,011 --> 00:12:56,869
Speaker 0: No, I don't have room on my desk, or I would.

247
00:12:57,310 --> 00:13:00,930
Speaker 1: You could have two monitors, have the widescreen, and then the other one.

248
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:02,090
Speaker 0: That's what I'm gonna do, probably.

249
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:02,770
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

250
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,177
Speaker 0: But I went to the Dell website, right?

251
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:07,030
Speaker 0: Now here's a few things I gotta say about this.

252
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,919
Speaker 0: Number one, widescreen monitors, right?

253
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:13,370
Speaker 0: They are a good deal, and they're just fine.

254
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:15,296
Speaker 0: I mean, buy one, I recommend it.

255
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:19,150
Speaker 0: But they're not as good a deal as you think.

256
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:20,989
Speaker 0: Because, think about this, right?

257
00:13:21,650 --> 00:13:27,870
Speaker 1: Well, just look at a square, and then look at a rectangle, and do some geometry, knowing that they measure diagonally.

258
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:29,010
Speaker 1: And I think it's self-evident.

259
00:13:29,150 --> 00:13:30,270
Speaker 0: Well, think about this, okay?

260
00:13:31,112 --> 00:13:32,782
Speaker 0: 20-inch widescreen, resolution, 1680x1050.

261
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,090
Speaker 0: 22-inch widescreen, same resolution.

262
00:13:38,211 --> 00:13:40,118
Speaker 0: You're not getting any more screen real estate.

263
00:13:40,198 --> 00:13:43,390
Speaker 0: All you're doing by buying the 22-inch is you can sit farther away.

264
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,430
Speaker 0: That's the only difference.

265
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:48,330
Speaker 1: Well, no, the thing is, I prefer, to a degree, a larger one.

266
00:13:48,771 --> 00:13:51,130
Speaker 0: Well, besides sitting farther away, what advantage is there?

267
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:51,669
Speaker 0: It's bigger.

268
00:13:53,271 --> 00:13:56,830
Speaker 0: What's the advantage, besides being able to sit farther away, what's the advantage of it being bigger?

269
00:13:57,071 --> 00:13:57,555
Speaker 1: It's bigger.

270
00:13:57,615 --> 00:13:58,463
Speaker 1: You can see it more easily.

271
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,930
Speaker 0: So you can sit slightly farther away?

272
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:03,890
Speaker 1: Or sit closer, and it's even clearer.

273
00:14:04,953 --> 00:14:06,727
Speaker 0: I don't see any other advantage to it being bigger.

274
00:14:07,616 --> 00:14:08,870
Speaker 1: A resolution is all that matters.

275
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,390
Speaker 1: Then get a 12-inch monitor with a 1900 by whatever crazy resolution.

276
00:14:13,691 --> 00:14:15,230
Speaker 0: There's a point at which it becomes silly.

277
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.

278
00:14:16,872 --> 00:14:19,850
Speaker 0: It's not true to the extreme, but it's true for two inches.

279
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,379
Speaker 1: No, I very much, because I had, at work, I had a 20-inch, 16, whatever, 1600x1050, or 1680x1050.

280
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:30,755
Speaker 1: And then at home, I got the 22-inch, 1680x1050.

281
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:31,418
Speaker 1: I much prefer the 22-inch.

282
00:14:34,752 --> 00:14:35,054
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

283
00:14:35,355 --> 00:14:36,662
Speaker 0: Anyway, I prefer the 1680x1050.

284
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:39,797
Speaker 1: So then at work, I got another 1680x1050, 22-inch.

285
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:43,749
Speaker 1: And then I got another one.

286
00:14:44,252 --> 00:14:45,445
Speaker 0: At work, I have a 22-inch.

287
00:14:45,465 --> 00:14:45,930
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan.

288
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:52,166
Speaker 0: But anyway, if you look, a 20-inch square non-widescreen monitor is 1600x1200.

289
00:14:56,473 --> 00:14:57,861
Speaker 0: 1600x1200 is a lot more than 1680x1050.

290
00:14:59,932 --> 00:15:04,570
Speaker 0: That's why the square monitor is $500 and the widescreen is $250.

291
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,410
Speaker 1: I still think you're better off with the widescreen.

292
00:15:06,650 --> 00:15:12,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why every laptop today is widescreen, because they can advertise more inches, right?

293
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:14,689
Speaker 0: Because that's what people look at, the inches.

294
00:15:15,091 --> 00:15:17,430
Speaker 0: But they're actually, you have less overall space.

295
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:18,770
Speaker 0: And they save money.

296
00:15:18,972 --> 00:15:20,490
Speaker 0: And that's why it seems like such a deal.

297
00:15:21,072 --> 00:15:23,410
Speaker 0: Like, oh my God, 20-inch monitor for almost nothing.

298
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:28,048
Speaker 0: Well, actually, a 19-inch square monitor is bigger than that 20-inch.

299
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:32,130
Speaker 0: You know, in terms of square inches and pixels and things.

300
00:15:32,270 --> 00:15:40,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course, pretty much every usability study shows that except for very specific applications, you're usually better off having more horizontal screen space.

301
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:46,450
Speaker 0: Well, the reason you're better off with horizontal space is because horizontal scrolling is a million times worse than vertical scrolling.

302
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,810
Speaker 1: But also, the side-by-side and toolbars and docking and everything.

303
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:50,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

304
00:15:50,433 --> 00:15:52,470
Speaker 0: I still like having separate monitors as well.

305
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:55,023
Speaker 1: Well, but that's not for, like, viewing.

306
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:56,130
Speaker 1: That's for, like, workflow.

307
00:15:56,472 --> 00:15:57,170
Speaker 0: Right, right, right, no.

308
00:15:57,230 --> 00:15:58,330
Speaker 1: Which is a totally different issue.

309
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,930
Speaker 0: So, anyway, I think I'm going to buy the 20-inch Dell widescreen because it can rotate sideways and be tall.

310
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:06,438
Speaker 1: Be warned.

311
00:16:06,822 --> 00:16:07,530
Speaker 1: Be warned.

312
00:16:07,810 --> 00:16:09,926
Speaker 1: Because I did that at work just to see because, like, hee-hee.

313
00:16:10,712 --> 00:16:11,828
Speaker 1: And I realized something.

314
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:15,750
Speaker 1: Pretty much every LCD monitor, you know, they have the viewing angle.

315
00:16:16,152 --> 00:16:19,870
Speaker 1: And they've really gotten the horizontal viewing angles to be a lot better than they used to be.

316
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,449
Speaker 0: The vertical viewing angle not so much.

317
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:25,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you turn it vertically, your viewing angle goes to shit.

318
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:30,310
Speaker 0: The thing is, that's okay because I would only turn it vertically when I'm coding, which is pretty much just text.

319
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,709
Speaker 0: And I'll be able to see anyway.

320
00:16:32,731 --> 00:16:36,290
Speaker 0: And that's when I can get a really tall VI and see lots of code at once.

321
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,924
Speaker 1: Honestly, if I were coding more than I do now, I would have two widescreens.

322
00:16:40,085 --> 00:16:41,190
Speaker 1: One vertical, one horizontal.

323
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:42,409
Speaker 0: Oh, that's not bad, but yeah.

324
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:43,110
Speaker 0: That's what I would do.

325
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,039
Speaker 0: I don't have room on my desk for that.

326
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,170
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I might buy that.

327
00:16:45,651 --> 00:16:51,770
Speaker 0: But the thing is, I went to the Dell website, and I'm pretty sure I did actually buy the monitor, but I didn't get an email.

328
00:16:52,491 --> 00:16:54,159
Speaker 0: So I'm not sure if it went through or not.

329
00:16:54,259 --> 00:16:56,389
Speaker 0: And I'm like, I could just go buy it again, but...

330
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,189
Speaker 1: Just buy it again.

331
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,397
Speaker 0: The thing is, is two gonna show up?

332
00:16:59,457 --> 00:17:03,270
Speaker 0: I gotta go check to see if they charge my credit card to figure out if I bought it or not.

333
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:03,929
Speaker 1: You should get on that.

334
00:17:04,109 --> 00:17:09,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna check after the show, and then if it wasn't charged to my credit card, I'll buy it.

335
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,949
Speaker 0: And if they send me two, I just won't open one, and I'll return it.

336
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:16,950
Speaker 1: But before we get on to the news, if I sound a little bit weird, probably for the rest of this week... You have horrible allergies.

337
00:17:17,231 --> 00:17:18,450
Speaker 1: I'm allergic to a degree.

338
00:17:18,770 --> 00:17:20,428
Speaker 0: Do you wanna talk about the Chromelim sodium fiasco?

339
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:26,329
Speaker 1: I'm gonna save that, but suffice to say, no one sells Chromelim sodium around here.

340
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:31,024
Speaker 1: And every pharmacist I've talked to has pretty much said, "Yeah, no one wants real medicine.

341
00:17:31,044 --> 00:17:32,248
Speaker 1: They'd rather use that Zicam

342
00:17:32,288 --> 00:17:32,629
Speaker 1: crap.".

343
00:17:33,111 --> 00:17:35,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't work and actually destroys your sense of smell?

344
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:37,006
Speaker 1: Yeah, one pharmacist was like, "Yeah, that stuff doesn't

345
00:17:37,046 --> 00:17:37,228
Speaker 1: work.".

346
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:40,821
Speaker 0: Zicam, if you use it, it will destroy your sense of smell.

347
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:43,590
Speaker 0: As in, you use it, you use it again, you use it again.

348
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:52,508
Speaker 0: Not only will it not do anything that it's supposed to do, or is, yeah, it says it will do, but you eventually won't be able to smell things.

349
00:17:52,669 --> 00:17:53,370
Speaker 0: Isn't that wonderful?

350
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:54,176
Speaker 1: You know what, though?

351
00:17:54,297 --> 00:17:55,569
Speaker 1: Even worse, a lot of people...

352
00:17:55,650 --> 00:18:01,550
Speaker 0: I guess if there's a lot of poop around, or if you're like, you know, a septic tank guy, Zicam is great.

353
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:07,650
Speaker 1: And other than the Zicam, they sell, like, there's a million nose sprays, but they're all actually the same thing as Afrin.

354
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,278
Speaker 0: Well, they're oxy-whatnot.

355
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,150
Speaker 0: There's actually another kind.

356
00:18:11,391 --> 00:18:13,319
Speaker 1: I'm not talking about that crap, but I'm talking about one that works.

357
00:18:13,781 --> 00:18:14,122
Speaker 1: Afrin.

358
00:18:14,464 --> 00:18:15,930
Speaker 1: It's something hydrochloride.

359
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the one I was talking about.

360
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:18,610
Speaker 1: Might be because there's another oxy-something.

361
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:21,795
Speaker 0: I was in the store and I looked at the nose sprays and I saw four kinds.

362
00:18:22,256 --> 00:18:30,110
Speaker 0: Saline, Afrin, Oxy-whatever, something else that was like phospho-something-something, and bullshit Zicam.

363
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,020
Speaker 1: But the thing is, the Afrin one, don't take that either because, yeah, that'll decongest someone.

364
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:39,490
Speaker 1: But then, if you don't take it again, you'll double congest.

365
00:18:42,131 --> 00:18:44,090
Speaker 1: It's this known rebound problem.

366
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:49,490
Speaker 0: There was actually a Mucinex brand nose spray, but it was just the Afrin.

367
00:18:49,751 --> 00:18:50,085
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was.

368
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,990
Speaker 0: And they had another one that was just the other kind.

369
00:18:52,430 --> 00:19:02,430
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, I like Mucinex, but now that I know all about it, I just buy the three different ingredients that make up the different Mucinexes and just make the same dosage.

370
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,013
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought the-.

371
00:19:09,993 --> 00:19:12,244
Speaker 0: Yeah, I bought the Sudafedrin Mucinex.

372
00:19:12,486 --> 00:19:13,330
Speaker 0: That'll last me forever.

373
00:19:13,710 --> 00:19:15,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, we've got all different three kinds.

374
00:19:15,420 --> 00:19:17,030
Speaker 1: We've got every combination for every sickness.

375
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:17,688
Speaker 0: For our meth lab.

376
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:29,350
Speaker 1: So, I don't have a lot to say about this, but in the news, people are talking about how there might be, this is purely speculation.

377
00:19:29,891 --> 00:19:30,270
Speaker 0: Speculation.

378
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:34,788
Speaker 1: But MacGyver movie, to which I said, "But there was already a MacGyver

379
00:19:34,828 --> 00:19:35,150
Speaker 1: movie.".

380
00:19:35,293 --> 00:19:36,010
Speaker 0: I did not know this.

381
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,788
Speaker 0: I saw it.

382
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:42,250
Speaker 1: When I was a kid- It was causing lead poisoning, and they found the woman's skull.

383
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:51,790
Speaker 0: See, when I was a kid, MacGyver, my cartoons would be over, and then I would see the MacGyver opener, and they would have commercials like, "Up next, MacGyver," and then I would turn it off and eat dinner.

384
00:19:52,030 --> 00:20:00,310
Speaker 1: I would skip the commercials and skip the cartoons and then sit down to watch me some MacGyver, because I gotta tell you what, Richard Dean Anderson is awesome.

385
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,244
Speaker 0: You know, I watched MacGyver a few times.

386
00:20:02,365 --> 00:20:02,870
Speaker 0: It was okay.

387
00:20:03,412 --> 00:20:03,878
Speaker 1: I liked it.

388
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:08,610
Speaker 0: I liked the fact that- It's better for making funny jokes about blowing up buildings with paperclips.

389
00:20:08,851 --> 00:20:10,598
Speaker 1: It was a pretty good show, all things considered.

390
00:20:10,658 --> 00:20:13,390
Speaker 1: The science, not always quite on the spot.

391
00:20:13,570 --> 00:20:14,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, there were better shows.

392
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:16,629
Speaker 0: I mean, Mission Impossible is a better show.

393
00:20:17,474 --> 00:20:19,050
Speaker 1: Eh, I preferred MacGyver.

394
00:20:19,434 --> 00:20:19,870
Speaker 0: Nah, anyway.

395
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,030
Speaker 1: Plus, Richard Dean Anderson.

396
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:26,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, MacGyver, like, you know it was in that time slot before MacGyver when I was a kid?

397
00:20:26,450 --> 00:20:27,350
Speaker 1: For me, it was the A-Team.

398
00:20:27,510 --> 00:20:30,090
Speaker 0: For me, it was 21 Jump Street was on that time slot.

399
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:30,573
Speaker 1: You know what?

400
00:20:30,995 --> 00:20:32,908
Speaker 1: I never actually watched 21 Jump Street.

401
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:35,790
Speaker 0: Me either, but I saw the opener, and then I turned it off and went to eat dinner.

402
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:39,830
Speaker 1: I turned on the TV, and it'd be like the end of 21 Jump Street.

403
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,489
Speaker 1: And I always wondered what it was about.

404
00:20:42,110 --> 00:20:46,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically it was like- I assumed it was like kids in a drug-invested school.

405
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:51,610
Speaker 0: I watched my cartoons, and then this live-action show opener would start, and I would turn it off and eat dinner.

406
00:20:52,951 --> 00:20:53,664
Speaker 0: Oh, those are the days.

407
00:20:53,745 --> 00:20:54,030
Speaker 0: Alright.

408
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:55,750
Speaker 1: I'm looking up what 21 Jump Street was.

409
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:56,416
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

410
00:20:56,558 --> 00:20:57,530
Speaker 0: You want me to do my news?

411
00:20:57,751 --> 00:20:58,369
Speaker 1: Alright, do your news.

412
00:20:59,452 --> 00:21:02,625
Speaker 0: So, Blu-Ray beat the shit out of HD DVD.

413
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:03,790
Speaker 0: That was a few months ago, right?

414
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,970
Speaker 0: Well, that's kind of like saying that, yeah- I beat the shit out of that baby.

415
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,030
Speaker 1: That one baby beat up that other baby.

416
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:19,030
Speaker 0: The news now, which isn't really news, because they've sort of just been saying the same thing, and it's sort of been true for a long time.

417
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:23,709
Speaker 0: It's just suddenly all the news organizations have decided to talk to, you know, put the story up.

418
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,009
Speaker 0: Blu-Ray sales stagnant, unlikely to improve this year.

419
00:21:29,753 --> 00:21:33,009
Speaker 0: Pretty much, they're saying exactly what everyone said before.

420
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,769
Speaker 0: Regardless of who wins this war, right, which has already won, the war is over.

421
00:21:39,190 --> 00:21:46,746
Speaker 0: People are happy with DVDs, Blu-Ray or HDVD, but basically Blu-Ray has no significant advantage over DVD.

422
00:21:46,927 --> 00:21:48,390
Speaker 0: that makes people want to switch to it.

423
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,829
Speaker 0: You know, I mean, most people don't even have HDTVs.

424
00:21:52,372 --> 00:21:54,790
Speaker 0: If they did, most people don't even hook them up right.

425
00:21:55,450 --> 00:21:58,790
Speaker 0: Blu-Ray players are really expensive, the discs are really expensive.

426
00:21:59,072 --> 00:22:02,367
Speaker 0: There's a rumor going around- There's a rumor going around.

427
00:22:02,630 --> 00:22:06,750
Speaker 0: There's a rumor that started with the guy who's the head of Netflix that they're going to charge more for renting a Blu-Ray.

428
00:22:08,412 --> 00:22:11,570
Speaker 0: And people already have large DVD collections, they're happy with their DVDs.

429
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:16,028
Speaker 0: And Blu-Ray is really not selling, except for in the PS3.

430
00:22:17,271 --> 00:22:20,730
Speaker 0: And the PS3 isn't really selling, at least not until the Metal Gear comes.

431
00:22:21,352 --> 00:22:26,507
Speaker 0: Honestly, I think part of what's doing it- The GTA will sell a few PS3s, but it's selling 360s as well.

432
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:31,490
Speaker 1: There's kind of been a general economic slowdown, and Blu-Ray is very expensive.

433
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:38,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, in an economic slowdown, people are not going to go and switch up their cheap DVD players for the Blu-Rays and HDTVs.

434
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,490
Speaker 0: That's not at the top of the list.

435
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:40,990
Speaker 1: The standalone players are hella expensive.

436
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,402
Speaker 0: People can't even afford gas and food.

437
00:22:42,442 --> 00:22:43,350
Speaker 0: They are hella expensive.

438
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:45,941
Speaker 0: Yeah, and gas- You know what's even more hella expensive?

439
00:22:46,042 --> 00:22:47,150
Speaker 0: A drive for your computer.

440
00:22:47,711 --> 00:22:50,090
Speaker 1: I actually know Blu-Ray drives are stupidly cheap.

441
00:22:50,374 --> 00:22:50,690
Speaker 1: Really?

442
00:22:50,810 --> 00:22:52,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like ludicrously cheap.

443
00:22:52,370 --> 00:22:52,887
Speaker 0: Maybe I should go.

444
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:55,110
Speaker 1: In fact, they come with all the laptops now.

445
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:58,450
Speaker 0: All the Dell laptops come with them, which is sort of like supposed to be the deal.

446
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:00,837
Speaker 0: Like everyone's like, "Hey, don't buy a Blu-Ray player.

447
00:23:01,058 --> 00:23:03,928
Speaker 0: Just buy a Dell laptop and then use the TV out and you'll be all

448
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:04,149
Speaker 0: set.".

449
00:23:04,652 --> 00:23:06,029
Speaker 0: Which is not a bad idea, really.

450
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:08,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is- If you need a laptop, at least.

451
00:23:08,234 --> 00:23:09,781
Speaker 0: Don't buy that instead of a player.

452
00:23:10,042 --> 00:23:11,710
Speaker 0: I'm sure the player's cheaper than a laptop.

453
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:12,232
Speaker 1: You know what?

454
00:23:12,372 --> 00:23:12,975
Speaker 1: I'll be honest.

455
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:16,669
Speaker 1: You're probably, if you want a Blu-Ray player, you're best off getting a PS3.

456
00:23:17,351 --> 00:23:22,723
Speaker 0: The PS3 really is the best bet for the Blu-Ray player, but- From what I read, it's better than all the real Blu-Ray players.

457
00:23:23,165 --> 00:23:24,170
Speaker 1: It's cheaper and better.

458
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:27,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the PS3, you know, it has some good stuff going on.

459
00:23:27,712 --> 00:23:28,590
Speaker 1: It has Gran Turismo.

460
00:23:29,270 --> 00:23:30,290
Speaker 0: Well, it has Gran Turismo.

461
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,650
Speaker 1: So, 21 Jump Street, 1987.

462
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,146
Speaker 0: Good God, my brother was one.

463
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,809
Speaker 1: That was more than a decade ago.

464
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:39,592
Speaker 0: I was five.

465
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:42,443
Speaker 0: All the old people who are older than me feel old.

466
00:23:42,483 --> 00:23:44,350
Speaker 0: All the young people weren't born yet, punk kids.

467
00:23:45,611 --> 00:23:53,709
Speaker 1: Quote, "21 Jump Street is the headquarters for a squad of police officers who specialize in investigations relating to young

468
00:23:53,749 --> 00:23:54,010
Speaker 1: people.".

469
00:23:54,732 --> 00:23:59,367
Speaker 1: "Each of the Jump Street personnel was selected for their ability to pass for high school

470
00:23:59,407 --> 00:23:59,828
Speaker 1: students.".

471
00:24:00,551 --> 00:24:05,007
Speaker 1: "Allowing them to operate undercover in areas where it is difficult for regular police officers to blend in

472
00:24:05,127 --> 00:24:05,629
Speaker 1: unnoticed.".

473
00:24:06,871 --> 00:24:08,198
Speaker 1: I guess I was right.

474
00:24:08,319 --> 00:24:10,550
Speaker 1: I thought it was about kids in high school with drugs.

475
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:12,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

476
00:24:12,374 --> 00:24:12,736
Speaker 0: Alright.

477
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,210
Speaker 0: Is that your news or what?

478
00:24:15,530 --> 00:24:16,487
Speaker 1: Well, you just did your news.

479
00:24:16,891 --> 00:24:17,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's your news?

480
00:24:18,051 --> 00:24:20,370
Speaker 1: I said there's gonna be maybe another MacGyver movie.

481
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,245
Speaker 0: Oh, that was your news?

482
00:24:21,732 --> 00:24:22,210
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

483
00:24:22,452 --> 00:24:22,708
Speaker 0: On Monday?

484
00:24:23,093 --> 00:24:25,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, MacGyver, Science and Tech.

485
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:27,750
Speaker 0: Alrighty, let's go to things of the day.

486
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:36,255
Speaker 1: So, things of the day.

487
00:24:36,275 --> 00:24:41,150
Speaker 1: This isn't related at all to Monday, so forget it, whatever.

488
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:42,970
Speaker 1: I found this guy really random.

489
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,590
Speaker 0: You really phoned it in.

490
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:46,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm full of allergies and it's kinda late.

491
00:24:47,292 --> 00:24:49,450
Speaker 0: You've been constantly sneezing for like hours.

492
00:24:50,132 --> 00:24:52,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, I keep hitting the mute button and blowing my nose for five minutes.

493
00:24:52,929 --> 00:24:53,170
Speaker 0: It's awful.

494
00:24:53,231 --> 00:24:54,508
Speaker 0: Did you order the stuff online?

495
00:24:55,011 --> 00:24:56,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it won't be here for a while.

496
00:24:56,813 --> 00:24:57,923
Speaker 0: How much did you order?

497
00:24:57,984 --> 00:24:58,650
Speaker 0: A lot, hopefully?

498
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,649
Speaker 1: I bought a case of it.

499
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:00,296
Speaker 1: There you go.

500
00:25:00,438 --> 00:25:01,549
Speaker 1: Enough to last you a few years?

501
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,030
Speaker 1: It takes about a week for it to take effect.

502
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:04,749
Speaker 0: That's fine.

503
00:25:05,292 --> 00:25:05,870
Speaker 1: But anyway.

504
00:25:06,030 --> 00:25:06,859
Speaker 0: You're the one suffering.

505
00:25:06,939 --> 00:25:07,970
Speaker 0: I'm only suffering partially.

506
00:25:08,550 --> 00:25:10,144
Speaker 1: This is from some TV show.

507
00:25:10,326 --> 00:25:10,770
Speaker 1: I'll admit.

508
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:11,950
Speaker 0: 21 Jump Street?

509
00:25:12,432 --> 00:25:12,796
Speaker 1: I wish.

510
00:25:12,817 --> 00:25:13,930
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

511
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,930
Speaker 0: People are gonna be talking about 21 Jump Street and The Forbes.

512
00:25:15,991 --> 00:25:17,628
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna have to do a show about 21 Jump Street.

513
00:25:17,910 --> 00:25:18,630
Speaker 1: I've never seen it.

514
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:19,149
Speaker 0: Me either.

515
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:22,088
Speaker 1: Thursday, we'll Skype someone in who liked it.

516
00:25:23,034 --> 00:25:23,708
Speaker 0: That's not a show.

517
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:28,910
Speaker 1: So, I think the guy on the left is Doogie Howser.

518
00:25:30,432 --> 00:25:32,130
Speaker 0: What's with the old TV shows today?

519
00:25:32,811 --> 00:25:33,153
Speaker 1: I don't know.

520
00:25:33,173 --> 00:25:35,410
Speaker 1: The actor who played Doogie Howser.

521
00:25:35,774 --> 00:25:36,306
Speaker 0: Alright, alright.

522
00:25:37,014 --> 00:25:38,269
Speaker 1: Not the real Doogie Howser.

523
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:40,149
Speaker 0: He's supposed to be like, he's an infamous dude.

524
00:25:41,171 --> 00:25:43,144
Speaker 1: Well, you learn that from Harold and Kumar.

525
00:25:43,185 --> 00:25:43,890
Speaker 1: Go to White Castle.

526
00:25:44,430 --> 00:25:44,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

527
00:25:46,534 --> 00:25:47,608
Speaker 1: Oh god, we should do a show on that.

528
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:49,309
Speaker 0: It's not worthy of a show.

529
00:25:49,853 --> 00:25:51,129
Speaker 1: Half of it was worthy of a show.

530
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,990
Speaker 0: Anyway, go down with your thing of the day.

531
00:25:53,296 --> 00:25:53,929
Speaker 1: Get on with it?

532
00:25:54,370 --> 00:25:55,187
Speaker 0: Get on with it.

533
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:55,893
Speaker 1: Alright.

534
00:25:56,195 --> 00:25:57,363
Speaker 1: I don't know what this show is.

535
00:25:57,404 --> 00:25:58,230
Speaker 1: Some kind of talk show.

536
00:25:58,650 --> 00:25:59,350
Speaker 1: But they're talking.

537
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:07,450
Speaker 1: And these two guys are talking about how with their friends like, yeah, they would like sing the confrontation song from Les Miserables at each other.

538
00:26:08,071 --> 00:26:13,239
Speaker 1: And I found that funny because when I was in high school, we totally did that with Dr.

539
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:13,902
Speaker 1: Jekyll and Mr.

540
00:26:13,963 --> 00:26:15,250
Speaker 1: Hyde, the gothic musical thriller.

541
00:26:15,852 --> 00:26:16,590
Speaker 1: But not well.

542
00:26:16,991 --> 00:26:17,337
Speaker 1: Oh, no, no.

543
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:17,989
Speaker 1: I'll get to that.

544
00:26:18,571 --> 00:26:25,310
Speaker 1: The only difference between what me and my friends did in high school and what these people are doing on this video is that they can sing.

545
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:29,827
Speaker 1: and good god, am I never going to sing anything from Dr.

546
00:26:29,867 --> 00:26:30,509
Speaker 1: Jekyll and Mr.

547
00:26:30,569 --> 00:26:32,469
Speaker 1: Hyde, the gothic musical thriller again.

548
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:34,150
Speaker 0: I mean, listen to these guys.

549
00:26:34,912 --> 00:26:41,150
Speaker 0: I thought they were just playing the album, the CD of Les Miserables that you can buy in the store.

550
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:42,329
Speaker 0: It sounds a lot like it.

551
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:46,989
Speaker 1: Well, they definitely used the phrasing of the original British cast as opposed to some of the later casts.

552
00:26:47,292 --> 00:26:55,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, that's the one that I know because, I mean, I saw it once live, you know, on Broadway, but mostly I've heard the CD or, I guess, the cassette tape.

553
00:26:56,130 --> 00:26:59,650
Speaker 1: I'm not going to sing, but there are two different, like, styles for doing Les Mis.

554
00:27:00,111 --> 00:27:06,210
Speaker 1: And in the opening scene, like one guy, one way where they're like, "Now I bring me prisoner two, four, six," so like they kind of drag it out.

555
00:27:06,632 --> 00:27:08,770
Speaker 1: And the other styles are like, "Now I bring me prisoner two, four, six,".

556
00:27:08,851 --> 00:27:10,050
Speaker 1: so one and then all this pause with the music.

557
00:27:10,050 --> 00:27:11,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the one that I hear.

558
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,110
Speaker 0: That's the one that you heard?

559
00:27:12,311 --> 00:27:13,390
Speaker 0: That's the one I've always heard.

560
00:27:13,533 --> 00:27:13,747
Speaker 0: Yeah.

561
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:14,970
Speaker 0: I never heard that other one.

562
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:16,309
Speaker 1: When I saw it, I saw the other one.

563
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:17,963
Speaker 0: I think that's even the one that I saw on Broadway.

564
00:27:18,003 --> 00:27:18,810
Speaker 0: did it the second way.

565
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,410
Speaker 1: I saw both on Broadway.

566
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:21,240
Speaker 1: Huh.

567
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:23,789
Speaker 1: I saw Les Mis like four times, though, because it was high school.

568
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:28,090
Speaker 0: The greatest part about seeing that play is the turning stage.

569
00:27:28,370 --> 00:27:30,390
Speaker 0: It's just this big circle, and it turns around.

570
00:27:30,571 --> 00:27:30,675
Speaker 0: I go,

571
00:27:30,778 --> 00:27:30,860
Speaker 0: "Whoo.".

572
00:27:31,231 --> 00:27:33,270
Speaker 1: I remember talking to the cast after.

573
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:37,547
Speaker 0: And then like those guys, like when they got like the chain gang, and they're walking.

574
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:38,409
Speaker 0: Look down.

575
00:27:38,770 --> 00:27:41,290
Speaker 0: They're staying still, but they're walking because it's a spinning circle.

576
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,370
Speaker 0: I learned one thing.

577
00:27:42,690 --> 00:27:44,510
Speaker 0: The guys practice walking at the same speed as the circle.

578
00:27:44,732 --> 00:27:49,869
Speaker 1: I talked to the cast afterward because it was like this high school trip, so I got this big poster actually with like the cast signing it.

579
00:27:51,081 --> 00:27:51,830
Speaker 1: But, oh man, high school.

580
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,390
Speaker 0: All right, so when you went to see Les Mis, right, which guy got the most applause of anybody?

581
00:27:56,951 --> 00:27:58,470
Speaker 1: Obviously, it was the Eternadiers.

582
00:27:59,176 --> 00:27:59,547
Speaker 0: Ah, yes.

583
00:28:00,056 --> 00:28:00,650
Speaker 0: That is correct.

584
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:03,770
Speaker 0: I saw like the best guy who was in that part ever.

585
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,410
Speaker 1: It's always the best guy in that part.

586
00:28:05,951 --> 00:28:12,670
Speaker 1: And the guy who played the sad guy looked exactly like Stephen Wright and sounded exactly like Stephen Wright.

587
00:28:12,935 --> 00:28:13,509
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

588
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:14,269
Speaker 1: It was Stephen Wright.

589
00:28:14,535 --> 00:28:14,826
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

590
00:28:14,971 --> 00:28:15,858
Speaker 0: It's all about-- What do you mean?

591
00:28:15,878 --> 00:28:16,390
Speaker 1: you don't remember?

592
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,310
Speaker 1: You didn't see it at like the Pantages.

593
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:18,775
Speaker 0: No.

594
00:28:21,432 --> 00:28:23,230
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'll skip all that.

595
00:28:23,330 --> 00:28:26,750
Speaker 1: All I learned is that it's really, really hard to walk on that stage.

596
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:27,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really is.

597
00:28:28,610 --> 00:28:34,225
Speaker 1: Okay, so check-- But this video, they're like, "Yeah, we used to do this to each other when we were friends way

598
00:28:34,265 --> 00:28:34,468
Speaker 1: back.".

599
00:28:34,771 --> 00:28:36,346
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Well, now you have to do

600
00:28:36,427 --> 00:28:36,467
Speaker 1: it.".

601
00:28:36,892 --> 00:28:38,090
Speaker 1: So they do it, and it's great.

602
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:40,010
Speaker 0: Yep, I just said it was great before.

603
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:45,109
Speaker 1: Yeah, but now I'm saying it's great, thus concluding my thing of the day and now I can blow my nose while you do yours.

604
00:28:45,811 --> 00:28:54,410
Speaker 0: All right, so me and Emily, we're talking before a week or so ago, and I was actually thinking about this even before then.

605
00:28:55,393 --> 00:29:00,129
Speaker 0: And basically, we live in a house that doesn't have a basement, doesn't have a garage, right?

606
00:29:00,532 --> 00:29:03,830
Speaker 0: But we're nerdy type people, and we want to do workshop kind of things.

607
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:07,090
Speaker 0: Like I want to cut some wood to make woodworking projects.

608
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:10,188
Speaker 1: Or like when I made that DDR pad back in the day.

609
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:12,902
Speaker 0: I want to do some metalworking, maybe machine some parts to--.

610
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:22,689
Speaker 0: Maybe if I want to do one of those cool how-to-do-it-yourself hack things, like a portable SNES, I need to machine some parts, right?

611
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:25,490
Speaker 0: And I need a metalworking shop or something.

612
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:26,870
Speaker 0: Or maybe I want to weld something.

613
00:29:27,612 --> 00:29:32,550
Speaker 0: I don't have a welder, I'm not going to buy a welder, but I might need to weld something once in a while.

614
00:29:33,251 --> 00:29:44,030
Speaker 1: And unless you have the resources and the space and the time to set all this up, you either have to give up, find someone else who has the stuff, or go the half-assed way.

615
00:29:44,390 --> 00:29:48,130
Speaker 1: And the half-assed way resulted in me burning myself a lot.

616
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:54,669
Speaker 0: Right, so it's like at RIT, I found out too late that there were actually metalworking labs that I could just use.

617
00:29:56,132 --> 00:30:01,368
Speaker 0: It was sort of like I was almost graduated, and I was like, "Wait a minute, I could just come to this lab and make

618
00:30:01,429 --> 00:30:01,610
Speaker 0: stuff?".

619
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:04,048
Speaker 0: They're like, "Yeah, you're a student here, what is your tuition paying

620
00:30:04,109 --> 00:30:04,210
Speaker 0: for?".

621
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:05,706
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Nobody tells

622
00:30:05,767 --> 00:30:05,868
Speaker 0: me!".

623
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:10,510
Speaker 0: And it was too late to get all Make Magazine up in that business, so it never happened.

624
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,050
Speaker 0: But lately I kind of want to be all Make Magazine up in this business, but it's not easy.

625
00:30:16,270 --> 00:30:22,509
Speaker 0: Well, somebody solved this problem before I did, and I just had to find out about them too late.

626
00:30:23,052 --> 00:30:26,369
Speaker 0: It's called Tech Shop, Build Your Dreams Here.

627
00:30:27,051 --> 00:30:39,309
Speaker 0: And what they do is it's sort of like, you know how you have a workout gym, like a sports club where they have all these big expensive machines you can't afford, but you go and you pay a membership fee and then you can go and use their machines whenever you want?

628
00:30:40,011 --> 00:30:45,430
Speaker 0: This is the same thing only for tools and tech things and metalworking.

629
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:51,349
Speaker 0: And the best thing is they know that most people-- because there's a lot more tools than there are workout machines, right?

630
00:30:51,712 --> 00:31:04,230
Speaker 0: They know that most people only know how to use a few of the tools, so they have all these classes where you know how to use these three machines and he knows how to use those three machines and you sort of teach each other, so everyone learns how to use all the machines they need to use.

631
00:31:04,651 --> 00:31:07,430
Speaker 1: That's a really good idea because you get out of your element really quick.

632
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:09,744
Speaker 1: It's like, "All right, I got this jigsaw down.

633
00:31:09,764 --> 00:31:10,067
Speaker 1: I can

634
00:31:10,107 --> 00:31:10,308
Speaker 1: jig.".

635
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:12,467
Speaker 1: And then you go over to the band saw and it's like, "All

636
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:12,729
Speaker 1: right.".

637
00:31:13,691 --> 00:31:17,530
Speaker 1: This may look like a jigsaw, but it does not act like a jigsaw.

638
00:31:17,750 --> 00:31:19,329
Speaker 0: Here's what it says on the side of their website.

639
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:34,525
Speaker 0: "Open classes as of Monday the 5th at 5.41 p.m "Introduction to soldering basics, CNC vinyl cutter SBU, "English wheel and cold form metal shaping, introductions to carbon fiber, "CNC plasma cutter

640
00:31:34,646 --> 00:31:34,849
Speaker 0: SBU.".

641
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:36,425
Speaker 0: I want to take the plasma cutter class.

642
00:31:36,506 --> 00:31:36,870
Speaker 0: Sweet.

643
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:43,430
Speaker 0: But basically, there's like one, two, three, four, five, six of these things in fucking California.

644
00:31:44,731 --> 00:31:51,390
Speaker 0: There's like two, one in Seattle, one in Portland, one in Texas, one in Florida, and one in North Carolina.

645
00:31:52,270 --> 00:31:53,898
Speaker 0: New York City, come on, step it up.

646
00:31:54,481 --> 00:31:55,526
Speaker 0: I need a lab here.

647
00:31:56,431 --> 00:31:59,709
Speaker 1: Someone out there, you want a business opportunity in Manhattan?

648
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:05,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is, the way these things work, the way they're funded, see, most people don't realize this.

649
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:14,169
Speaker 0: The way a workout gym makes its money, like a New York sports club or a Gold's Gym or any of those places, the way they make their money is this.

650
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:16,139
Speaker 0: They have big membership drives.

651
00:32:16,199 --> 00:32:18,150
Speaker 0: They say, "Join, join, join, join, join," right?

652
00:32:18,532 --> 00:32:20,829
Speaker 0: And they charge like 30 bucks a month or something like that.

653
00:32:21,170 --> 00:32:25,610
Speaker 0: And people join, join, join, join, join, but hardly anyone actually goes.

654
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:29,350
Speaker 0: Such a small percentage of the people actually show up.

655
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:30,032
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

656
00:32:30,253 --> 00:32:35,150
Speaker 1: If you go to a gym between January 2nd and January 8th, it'll be packed.

657
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,030
Speaker 1: Right, right, right.

658
00:32:36,110 --> 00:32:36,848
Speaker 1: But they don't go back.

659
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:37,996
Speaker 0: No, no.

660
00:32:38,016 --> 00:32:39,950
Speaker 0: People will go once and they usually won't come back.

661
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:48,590
Speaker 0: If everyone who actually had a membership went regularly, they'd be out of business because they would have to buy so many machines to keep up with it that they would be screwed.

662
00:32:49,030 --> 00:32:53,890
Speaker 0: So they buy a very small amount of machines of a very large membership that they can't realistically accommodate.

663
00:32:54,713 --> 00:33:00,790
Speaker 0: So like ISPs, they have very little bandwidth and all these people pay for the bandwidth, but only a few people actually use it a lot.

664
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:06,790
Speaker 0: And thus they get away with not having enough bandwidth to support everyone using all of the bandwidth they pay for at once.

665
00:33:07,434 --> 00:33:08,770
Speaker 0: So that's how gyms make their money.

666
00:33:08,850 --> 00:33:12,950
Speaker 0: This place can't do that because you'd be damn sure anyone who pays is showing up, right?

667
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:14,066
Speaker 0: So what do they do?

668
00:33:14,652 --> 00:33:18,270
Speaker 0: What they do is they get loans, but they don't get loans from the bank.

669
00:33:18,652 --> 00:33:21,830
Speaker 0: They get loans from people in the community who want to be members.

670
00:33:22,893 --> 00:33:27,585
Speaker 0: If a place like this wanted to open up, I, Scott Rubin, would give them a $25,000 loan.

671
00:33:29,710 --> 00:33:35,570
Speaker 0: They would pay me back and I would be a member and I'd be able to vote and maybe I'd even own part of the place.

672
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's called a business.

673
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:38,167
Speaker 0: Right, right, right.

674
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:41,550
Speaker 0: But that's how they do it, these community loan deals.

675
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:50,309
Speaker 0: I think that's a pretty cool idea and I think that's probably the only way that something like this would ever be able to exist short of Bill Gates just giving them the money or something like that.

676
00:33:50,932 --> 00:33:52,678
Speaker 0: So yeah, come on.

677
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,762
Speaker 0: We need this in New York.

678
00:33:53,822 --> 00:33:54,806
Speaker 0: I need to make things.

679
00:33:55,469 --> 00:33:55,689
Speaker 0: Come on.

680
00:33:56,611 --> 00:34:01,050
Speaker 1: Alright, so we were thinking about talking about the memristor for the main kind of show.

681
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:01,678
Speaker 0: We probably should.

682
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:02,290
Speaker 0: You got a better idea?

683
00:34:02,671 --> 00:34:03,113
Speaker 1: I don't know.

684
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:04,803
Speaker 1: It's already 9.30.

685
00:34:04,803 --> 00:34:06,090
Speaker 1: I'm feeling tired and allergy.

686
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:07,081
Speaker 0: You can talk about anything.

687
00:34:07,102 --> 00:34:07,730
Speaker 0: Talk about something.

688
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:08,681
Speaker 1: I could just cop.

689
00:34:08,723 --> 00:34:09,150
Speaker 1: I could bail.

690
00:34:09,795 --> 00:34:10,188
Speaker 0: Don't bail.

691
00:34:10,429 --> 00:34:10,812
Speaker 0: Don't bail.

692
00:34:11,254 --> 00:34:14,330
Speaker 1: Alright, Scott, so how does a memristor work?

693
00:34:15,533 --> 00:34:16,449
Speaker 0: Forget the chemical.

694
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,050
Speaker 1: No, no, but like what are the inputs and outputs?

695
00:34:21,353 --> 00:34:22,248
Speaker 1: How stateful is it?

696
00:34:22,889 --> 00:34:24,228
Speaker 0: It's analog stateful.

697
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,190
Speaker 1: But no, no, I mean how stateful as in does it keep its state forever?

698
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,050
Speaker 1: Does it need to be refreshed at all?

699
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,489
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't need to be refreshed.

700
00:34:32,754 --> 00:34:32,909
Speaker 0: Ever?

701
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:36,489
Speaker 0: It might in a very, very long time, but not in a short time.

702
00:34:38,031 --> 00:34:38,409
Speaker 0: Alright.

703
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:38,937
Speaker 1: Alright.

704
00:34:39,371 --> 00:34:40,350
Speaker 1: Off to a good start here.

705
00:34:40,731 --> 00:34:40,953
Speaker 0: Yes.

706
00:34:40,973 --> 00:34:43,049
Speaker 0: Okay, let's go back a little bit, right?

707
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:51,735
Speaker 0: In electronics, right, there are three things that make pretty much every electronic device is made up of three things.

708
00:34:51,795 --> 00:34:57,330
Speaker 0: It's made up of resistors, inductors, and capacitors.

709
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:01,490
Speaker 1: Now, why are those the three fundamental components as opposed to say diodes or other things?

710
00:35:01,770 --> 00:35:06,690
Speaker 0: Well, a diode is actually a combination of resistors, capacitors, and inductors.

711
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,310
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

712
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:07,705
Speaker 0: Is it?

713
00:35:08,010 --> 00:35:08,528
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure.

714
00:35:10,313 --> 00:35:11,039
Speaker 0: I might be wrong.

715
00:35:11,079 --> 00:35:12,450
Speaker 0: I don't have an electronics degree.

716
00:35:13,174 --> 00:35:14,441
Speaker 0: I don't know that much about it.

717
00:35:14,883 --> 00:35:16,049
Speaker 0: I know PV equals an RT.

718
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:17,428
Speaker 1: What does a diode do?

719
00:35:18,853 --> 00:35:20,530
Speaker 0: It has three prongs on it.

720
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:21,687
Speaker 1: No, it has two.

721
00:35:22,891 --> 00:35:23,537
Speaker 0: No, I don't know.

722
00:35:23,598 --> 00:35:24,830
Speaker 0: I've used ones with three prongs.

723
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:26,330
Speaker 1: Are you sure those weren't transistors?

724
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:27,813
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

725
00:35:28,074 --> 00:35:30,342
Speaker 0: Anyway, I know a transistor also has three prongs.

726
00:35:31,326 --> 00:35:32,370
Speaker 0: Anyway, we suck at electronics.

727
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,510
Speaker 1: What are the inputs and outputs on a transistor?

728
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:36,016
Speaker 0: Oh, a transistor.

729
00:35:36,077 --> 00:35:37,769
Speaker 0: Okay, I know how a transistor works because that's my...

730
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:38,504
Speaker 1: PNP or NPN?

731
00:35:42,911 --> 00:35:50,570
Speaker 0: A transistor has one in and one out, and then there's the toggle on the top where you sort of... If there's electricity going in the top, then it's a pass-through.

732
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:54,470
Speaker 0: If it's not going in the top, then it doesn't pass through, and that's how it works.

733
00:35:56,410 --> 00:35:56,787
Speaker 0: Anyway...

734
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,690
Speaker 1: All right, so continue.

735
00:35:58,450 --> 00:36:08,650
Speaker 0: So recently, there was a theoretical... Since the '70s, since a long time ago, there was a theoretical fourth component of electronics.

736
00:36:08,831 --> 00:36:11,421
Speaker 0: There was the memristor, and it was only on paper.

737
00:36:11,482 --> 00:36:16,719
Speaker 0: Like, no one actually had one of these things, but if you did the math, you said, "Aha!

738
00:36:16,779 --> 00:36:19,847
Speaker 0: There could be this other fourth thing, but it doesn't

739
00:36:19,888 --> 00:36:20,229
Speaker 0: exist.".

740
00:36:20,871 --> 00:36:24,449
Speaker 0: And people from time to time tried to make it, and it never really worked out.

741
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:29,029
Speaker 0: Until very recently, HP actually made it, and that's crazy.

742
00:36:29,850 --> 00:36:39,668
Speaker 0: Like, holy shit crazy, but people don't realize how crazy it is because, like me, they don't understand electronics, and I'm sure that... I already know some of our friends are like, "Uh, Scott, you know what I think about

743
00:36:39,708 --> 00:36:40,210
Speaker 0: electronics?".

744
00:36:40,250 --> 00:36:43,309
Speaker 0: And they're going to start emailing and forming, saying how moron I am.

745
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:56,810
Speaker 0: But that's what I get for not reading the Wikipedia before doing this episode, and Rym not saying much and helping me out, mostly challenging me and exposing my lack of electronics knowledge, which is fine, because I admit I lack electronics knowledge.

746
00:36:56,810 --> 00:37:03,550
Speaker 1: Well, you see, I don't know a lot, but I know that a diode does not have three terminals.

747
00:37:04,072 --> 00:37:12,685
Speaker 0: I remember making a little project, it was like a little burglar alarm, and they said, "Yeah, put the diode there," and it had three prongies on the bottom.

748
00:37:12,726 --> 00:37:13,670
Speaker 0: It was like a little black square.

749
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:16,750
Speaker 1: Are you sure that wasn't a transistor?

750
00:37:17,894 --> 00:37:18,910
Speaker 0: I don't know anymore.

751
00:37:18,991 --> 00:37:19,930
Speaker 1: I think it was a transistor.

752
00:37:20,190 --> 00:37:21,741
Speaker 0: Anyway, it could have been.

753
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:22,526
Speaker 0: I don't know.

754
00:37:22,667 --> 00:37:23,089
Speaker 0: I'm lost.

755
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:26,150
Speaker 0: Regardless, the memristor is crazy.

756
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:28,650
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess it could have been like a rectifier diode.

757
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:31,116
Speaker 0: I don't know.

758
00:37:31,136 --> 00:37:33,130
Speaker 0: I don't know anything.

759
00:37:34,691 --> 00:37:36,217
Speaker 0: So, a memristor.

760
00:37:36,779 --> 00:37:39,450
Speaker 0: A memristor is crazy, because what it does is this, right?

761
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:47,790
Speaker 0: Right now, if you want to store a bit, you want to remember a bit, the ways we have to do that are a few.

762
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:55,169
Speaker 0: We can do a flip-flop, but a flip-flop, you lose the electricity, it's not flip-flopped anymore, really.

763
00:37:56,012 --> 00:38:03,250
Speaker 0: We can do a capacitor, which is what RAM does, but RAM also loses when you turn the electricity off.

764
00:38:03,590 --> 00:38:04,850
Speaker 0: Not immediately, but eventually.

765
00:38:05,551 --> 00:38:15,330
Speaker 0: We can do a circuit breaker kind of thing, which is like what your BIOS does, or your CMOS, which is incredibly slow, and it's like a bunch of switches moving back, it's terrible.

766
00:38:16,431 --> 00:38:21,210
Speaker 0: We can do a magnet thing, which is what your hard drive does, also horrendously slow.

767
00:38:22,274 --> 00:38:23,669
Speaker 0: And we can do flash, also.

768
00:38:24,531 --> 00:38:25,808
Speaker 0: And those are pretty much the big ones.

769
00:38:27,032 --> 00:38:29,510
Speaker 0: Oh, we can do a register, but a register is flip-flops, right?

770
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:32,969
Speaker 0: So, what else, you know, do you really, what are we going to do?

771
00:38:33,590 --> 00:38:36,830
Speaker 0: The memristor is pretty much like the ultimate answer to this problem.

772
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:42,250
Speaker 0: What you have is they have this special chemical, I forget what chemical they used, I didn't read it.

773
00:38:42,592 --> 00:38:43,580
Speaker 0: It was like lead, or I forget.

774
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:50,910
Speaker 0: Anyway, you send a current across the memristor in one direction, right?

775
00:38:51,571 --> 00:38:58,049
Speaker 0: And as you send the current across, right, you send a direct current, DC.

776
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:04,670
Speaker 0: DC current across in one direction, across the memristor, and the resistance increases.

777
00:39:05,832 --> 00:39:10,690
Speaker 0: And you send the direct current across in the other direction, and the resistance decreases.

778
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:18,370
Speaker 1: Now, the common thing that people mistake right away is that somehow you have to keep having this current there.

779
00:39:18,530 --> 00:39:20,190
Speaker 1: It's like it's just you control it with the current.

780
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:29,810
Speaker 0: No, because the way it's made, the chemical that's in there, you apply the current, and the chemical sort of moves and changes, and now is more resistant.

781
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:34,910
Speaker 0: And it's not going to move again unless you send some more direct current at it from one of the directions.

782
00:39:35,851 --> 00:39:39,530
Speaker 0: And then, what you do is you send an alternating current into the memristor.

783
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:46,970
Speaker 0: Now, the alternating current won't move it, so its resistance level will not change when sending an alternating current.

784
00:39:47,471 --> 00:39:57,869
Speaker 0: But what you can do is you send the alternating current in one side, and on the other side, you can figure out, by looking at the alternating current that comes out, how much it resisted you.

785
00:39:58,750 --> 00:40:05,070
Speaker 0: Thus, you use direct current to change the data that's in there, and use alternating current to read.

786
00:40:05,793 --> 00:40:10,310
Speaker 0: So it's this little thing, it's a circuit, and you can read, and you can write.

787
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:17,830
Speaker 0: And not only can you read and you write one and zero, like you could say if the resistance is below one, it's zero, and if it's above one, it's one, right?

788
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:27,250
Speaker 0: And now you have basically what amounts to storing one bit of data, and it will store that one bit of data even if you turn all the electricity off, and it's wicked fast.

789
00:40:28,231 --> 00:40:38,810
Speaker 0: But you could say, well, since I can basically change the resistance between the minimum resistance it can handle and the maximum, I could make sort of an analog thing.

790
00:40:38,950 --> 00:40:41,026
Speaker 0: It could store any number from zero to 100 maybe.

791
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:49,550
Speaker 0: I could divide it into 32 sections and say, look, I can store 32 possible values on this one memristor.

792
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:54,750
Speaker 0: And since it's really small, and it's a fundamental component, we could get a whole zillion of these things in there.

793
00:40:55,233 --> 00:40:56,890
Speaker 0: And that's crazy.

794
00:40:57,371 --> 00:41:04,850
Speaker 0: In terms of what it means for consumer electronics, it's probably going to start out with crazy fast RAM.

795
00:41:05,050 --> 00:41:08,050
Speaker 1: It's non-volatile storage, but you can also use it for control.

796
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:11,870
Speaker 0: It's going to start out with maybe replacing flash.

797
00:41:12,290 --> 00:41:16,310
Speaker 0: That IBM racetrack memory we talked about might be basically screwed.

798
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:25,090
Speaker 0: You might see CPUs that have a lot of actual storage space in them, like a CPU.

799
00:41:25,291 --> 00:41:29,530
Speaker 1: Well, remember, in its current implementations, it's not that fast yet.

800
00:41:29,850 --> 00:41:31,009
Speaker 0: No, but it's going to be.

801
00:41:31,671 --> 00:41:33,780
Speaker 1: It's one order of magnitude slower than dynamic RAM.

802
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:36,571
Speaker 1: Right.

803
00:41:37,032 --> 00:41:49,790
Speaker 0: But I mean, we're talking like a CPU where you could turn the electricity off on the computer, turn it back on, and the RAM and the CPU, if they're both just memristors, will pick up right where they left off.

804
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:57,470
Speaker 0: So you could turn your computer off, off, off, off, completely off, and then turn it back on and it won't even boot.

805
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:01,570
Speaker 0: It'll just be immediately back on where it was when you turned it off.

806
00:42:02,071 --> 00:42:03,280
Speaker 0: That's like the beginning.

807
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:09,290
Speaker 0: That is like the first most obvious thing you can do with this amazing technology.

808
00:42:10,091 --> 00:42:18,310
Speaker 1: I'm imagining more that with this sort of analog control, you could make very large branching networks and do really crazy kind of neural style things.

809
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:22,242
Speaker 0: That's what the scientists type people are hoping.

810
00:42:22,282 --> 00:42:31,989
Speaker 0: is that because it's not just one or zero, you can sort of get this levels of resistance that you can sort of get a few memristors together and sort of simulate something like a neuron.

811
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:38,950
Speaker 0: Or even if you can't make a brain, you can make a computer that works more like a brain than like a core two duo.

812
00:42:40,731 --> 00:42:44,825
Speaker 0: Anything else to say about the memristor except about how amazing this is.

813
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:46,370
Speaker 0: an amazing discovery of holy shit?

814
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:50,390
Speaker 1: As amazing as it is, I'm full of allergies and I'm just kind of waiting to bail tonight.

815
00:42:50,930 --> 00:42:51,653
Speaker 0: Yeah.

816
00:42:51,673 --> 00:42:53,018
Speaker 0: HP is the people who invented this.

817
00:42:53,078 --> 00:42:56,530
Speaker 0: So invest in them when the stock price already went up a little too late.

818
00:42:56,810 --> 00:43:00,630
Speaker 1: Do not take anything that I said today to be investment advice of any kind.

819
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,450
Speaker 0: No, it's not allowed to give investment advice.

820
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:07,450
Speaker 0: And I know nothing about the stock market except I won the stock market game when I was in like 10th grade.

821
00:43:07,631 --> 00:43:08,408
Speaker 0: Oh, no, seventh grade.

822
00:43:10,252 --> 00:43:15,190
Speaker 0: But yeah, if I would have known this news story a day before it hit the news, I would have bought HP that day.

823
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:23,470
Speaker 1: Well, actually, the thing is, despite all the news about HP, there's at least one other company that has a patent for a very, very similar thing.

824
00:43:23,712 --> 00:43:24,530
Speaker 1: They'll do the same thing.

825
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:25,552
Speaker 0: Yeah.

826
00:43:25,572 --> 00:43:33,810
Speaker 0: I would say, since it's already sort of too late to get the HP before it jumps up, I say wait for the, like, pay attention to the patent story on this.

827
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:37,563
Speaker 0: Because there might be like, you know, all sorts of stuff like.

828
00:43:37,603 --> 00:43:38,687
Speaker 0: this is a fundamental thing.

829
00:43:38,727 --> 00:43:39,550
Speaker 0: You can't patent it.

830
00:43:39,831 --> 00:43:42,886
Speaker 0: There might be things like, well, this guy actually came up with it.

831
00:43:42,906 --> 00:43:43,569
Speaker 0: You just made it.

832
00:43:43,810 --> 00:43:47,990
Speaker 0: And this, you know, all the different specific parts of it are patented by different people.

833
00:43:48,770 --> 00:43:51,010
Speaker 1: No, the idea is not, that has nothing to do with it.

834
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:54,409
Speaker 1: If you're going to talk about patents, what is patented is the process.

835
00:43:56,016 --> 00:43:56,508
Speaker 0: That is true.

836
00:43:57,111 --> 00:44:03,590
Speaker 1: And as manufacturing goes, I mean, remember, I worked in a manufacturing environment at IBM where we made like the cell chips, among other things.

837
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:13,830
Speaker 1: And the art and the science of making the things counts for a billion times more than the theoretical or even the proof of concept.

838
00:44:14,010 --> 00:44:14,150
Speaker 0: Yep.

839
00:44:14,471 --> 00:44:26,169
Speaker 0: But I would keep an eye on how this patent war is going to play out and whoever wins, I would get your monies ready if you're that kind of person who likes to, you know, invest in the stocks and not just your safe old 401k.

840
00:44:27,413 --> 00:44:29,010
Speaker 1: Again, I have no opinion whatsoever.

841
00:44:29,191 --> 00:44:30,696
Speaker 0: Ram has no opinion.

842
00:44:31,398 --> 00:44:31,719
Speaker 0: Yeah.

843
00:44:31,799 --> 00:44:35,030
Speaker 0: But it's funny how like these amazing discoveries happen.

844
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:43,410
Speaker 0: But like most people, either because they can't understand them or because I don't know the way the world is, like you don't sort of fully grasp it.

845
00:44:43,851 --> 00:44:44,814
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know.

846
00:44:45,196 --> 00:44:46,700
Speaker 0: It doesn't seem like this thing happens.

847
00:44:46,761 --> 00:44:49,670
Speaker 0: This kind of amazing discovery happens too often anymore.

848
00:44:50,332 --> 00:44:54,530
Speaker 0: You know what happened when he said everything that can be invented has been invented.

849
00:44:54,952 --> 00:44:58,406
Speaker 1: There's a layman's way to understand why this is so revolutionary.

850
00:44:58,446 --> 00:44:59,430
Speaker 1: Like here's the proof.

851
00:45:00,650 --> 00:45:06,550
Speaker 1: There are now two terms that you will need to know in electronics, memristance and memductance.

852
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:07,791
Speaker 0: Yeah.

853
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:14,330
Speaker 0: I mean, pretty much they have to rewrite every electronics textbook, all of them.

854
00:45:15,191 --> 00:45:16,294
Speaker 0: It's that crazy.

855
00:45:16,615 --> 00:45:22,650
Speaker 0: Like, you know, there's advances now and then, you know, and this advances all the time in electronics, actually.

856
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:26,529
Speaker 0: But none of them are like, OK, we have to rewrite the whole textbook right now.

857
00:45:26,831 --> 00:45:31,890
Speaker 0: They're usually, OK, we'll revise the textbook and we'll make a few corrections here and there for new things we learned.

858
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,630
Speaker 0: This is throw your textbook out the window material here.

859
00:45:35,870 --> 00:45:39,710
Speaker 0: This is like you might not see this again in your life, this kind of advancement.

860
00:45:39,951 --> 00:45:43,910
Speaker 1: I mean, it's kind of like, you know, we have logic, it's like and and or nor.

861
00:45:44,332 --> 00:45:46,770
Speaker 1: It's not possible with just, you know, with straight logic.

862
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:51,209
Speaker 1: But imagine if someone came up with a new gate that did something else.

863
00:45:51,592 --> 00:45:54,770
Speaker 0: I can't even think because there's no discrete math to go with the gate.

864
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:55,292
Speaker 0: It's not like.

865
00:45:55,313 --> 00:45:56,682
Speaker 0: this is discrete math.

866
00:45:56,702 --> 00:45:57,830
Speaker 0: We don't have a gate to go with it.

867
00:45:58,070 --> 00:46:02,607
Speaker 1: That's because like saying, well, in the two dimensional world, I know what's the third dimension like.

868
00:46:02,667 --> 00:46:03,390
Speaker 1: now there isn't one.

869
00:46:03,811 --> 00:46:10,910
Speaker 0: I know it's like there is no logical syllogism that we cannot make with Gates.

870
00:46:10,990 --> 00:46:12,013
Speaker 0: So it's like I couldn't even.

871
00:46:12,233 --> 00:46:18,630
Speaker 0: this is where basically the memristor is where he had the syllogism, but we didn't have the actual component to make it happen.

872
00:46:18,953 --> 00:46:20,689
Speaker 0: But now we have it, which is why it's crazy.

873
00:46:21,252 --> 00:46:21,433
Speaker 0: All right.

874
00:46:21,453 --> 00:46:24,970
Speaker 0: It's like as if we knew we could do Nand on paper, but we didn't actually have a Nand gate.

875
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:29,570
Speaker 1: So we had to get around suddenly, you know, that would have been the worst case because Nand is the simplest gate.

876
00:46:30,753 --> 00:46:35,570
Speaker 0: I know that you can pretty much make everything that you can make with Gates with Nand Gates only.

877
00:46:35,710 --> 00:46:36,317
Speaker 1: Well, what do you mean?

878
00:46:36,357 --> 00:46:37,146
Speaker 1: Pretty much you can.

879
00:46:37,166 --> 00:46:37,470
Speaker 0: I know.

880
00:46:37,871 --> 00:46:41,450
Speaker 1: That's why if you go to Radio Shack, you can buy a chip that's just like 40 Nand Gates.

881
00:46:41,650 --> 00:46:42,317
Speaker 0: Those are the best chips.

882
00:46:42,357 --> 00:46:43,629
Speaker 0: It's just a big long bug.

883
00:46:43,991 --> 00:46:48,150
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, these two and then that one and these two goes to that one and these two goes to that one.

884
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:49,528
Speaker 0: And they're all just Nand Gates lined up.

885
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:53,250
Speaker 1: And on that note, I was muted and sneezing for a while, so I'm totally bailing.

886
00:46:53,552 --> 00:46:53,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's bail.

887
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:03,029
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

888
00:47:03,150 --> 00:47:05,620
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.
