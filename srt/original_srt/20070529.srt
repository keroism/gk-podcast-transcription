1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,289
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, May 29th.

2
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:11,832
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:14,687 --> 00:00:15,119
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,420
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights!

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:25,600
Speaker 1: Tonight, despite continuing to be sick, we continue getting into it week with German board gaming!

6
00:00:28,363 --> 00:00:29,378
Speaker 0: Let's do this!

7
00:00:31,364 --> 00:00:40,907
Speaker 1: So you're all aware that yesterday, last night, I said that my new motherboard was coming today, and it was coming today, and UPS in their infinite wisdom decided, "You know what?

8
00:00:41,629 --> 00:00:45,240
Speaker 1: We've technically got one more day before the deadline to deliver this.

9
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:47,529
Speaker 1: So we're just not gonna ship it to Rem.

10
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,373
Speaker 1: No, no, we're

11
00:00:48,393 --> 00:00:48,654
Speaker 1: not.".

12
00:00:48,795 --> 00:00:49,880
Speaker 0: So you lied, basically.

13
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,363
Speaker 1: Basically, they lied.

14
00:00:51,403 --> 00:00:52,728
Speaker 0: The thing is- But you lied, though.

15
00:00:52,748 --> 00:00:54,132
Speaker 1: No, I didn't lie.

16
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:54,654
Speaker 0: Yes, you did.

17
00:00:54,714 --> 00:00:59,269
Speaker 0: On the show yesterday, you said, "Tomorrow, I'll have my motherboard, unless something,".

18
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:01,496
Speaker 0: but the something wasn't- UPS doesn't bring it.

19
00:01:01,537 --> 00:01:02,520
Speaker 0: The something was something else.

20
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:03,483
Speaker 1: Oh, was it?

21
00:01:03,503 --> 00:01:09,976
Speaker 1: Well, the point is, it's not lying if you, in good faith, say something, knowing that someone else will come through, and then they don't come through.

22
00:01:09,996 --> 00:01:18,547
Speaker 0: Well, even though you may not be making yourself the liar, someone else made you a liar, so you can't really be blamed for it, but you still lied either way.

23
00:01:18,567 --> 00:01:21,200
Speaker 1: See, I don't think you did, because when you said it, you weren't lying.

24
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:23,285
Speaker 1: Therefore, it wasn't a lie.

25
00:01:23,626 --> 00:01:25,772
Speaker 1: At most, the situation changed after the fact.

26
00:01:25,792 --> 00:01:33,320
Speaker 0: If you say something as definite, and you say it about the future, there is always a risk that you will end up being a liar, and you must know that risk.

27
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:35,047
Speaker 1: I don't think that qualifies as a lie.

28
00:01:35,489 --> 00:01:39,385
Speaker 0: So, if I say something about the future, and it turns out to be wrong-

29
00:01:39,867 --> 00:01:51,384
Speaker 1: As has been showed in every D&D game, if you believe something to be true, then you are not lying, because, had you cast "detect lies" on me, and I'd failed my save, that statement would have been true when I said it.

30
00:01:51,665 --> 00:01:55,720
Speaker 1: Otherwise, "detect lie" becomes a wonderful way to figure out what's going to happen to the future.

31
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:58,479
Speaker 1: You cast it every day, and say, "I am going to live another

32
00:01:58,519 --> 00:01:58,620
Speaker 1: day.".

33
00:01:59,901 --> 00:02:09,110
Speaker 0: What if you know augury, or some such, or even divination, and you don't bother to use augury or divination, but you say something about the future anyway?

34
00:02:09,352 --> 00:02:10,035
Speaker 1: It's still not a lie.

35
00:02:10,055 --> 00:02:11,160
Speaker 0: And you didn't even bother to check.

36
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:14,779
Speaker 1: It's only a lie if you willfully deceive others.

37
00:02:16,002 --> 00:02:18,819
Speaker 0: Well, you were willful, and deceived.

38
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:20,902
Speaker 1: Okay.

39
00:02:21,424 --> 00:02:22,868
Speaker 0: So, this computer that didn't show up.

40
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:26,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's gonna be here tomorrow, and luckily, I'm taking Thursday off the board.

41
00:02:27,864 --> 00:02:29,153
Speaker 1: Well, if it has to come tomorrow.

42
00:02:29,233 --> 00:02:30,099
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I get some money.

43
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:33,040
Speaker 0: Well, how are you gonna get money if it doesn't come tomorrow?

44
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:36,060
Speaker 1: Because UPS didn't ship it within the required time.

45
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,719
Speaker 0: So, how do you get money from that?

46
00:02:38,022 --> 00:02:38,660
Speaker 1: Civil lawsuit.

47
00:02:39,361 --> 00:02:39,767
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

48
00:02:39,807 --> 00:02:40,193
Speaker 0: That works.

49
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:41,502
Speaker 1: It's gonna come.

50
00:02:42,084 --> 00:02:50,300
Speaker 1: But, like I was saying, I took the day off work Thursday, so it's gonna come tomorrow, and then I'm just gonna stay home all day, fiddling with my new computer.

51
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:54,295
Speaker 0: That sounds like a good plan to make, because, uh, current computer.

52
00:02:54,576 --> 00:02:55,420
Speaker 0: Still a piece of shit.

53
00:02:55,723 --> 00:02:57,220
Speaker 1: Current computer doing just fine.

54
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,900
Speaker 0: You seem to always say it's doing just fine, until it doesn't do just fine.

55
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:04,900
Speaker 1: I point out that the computer I have right now runs better than a lot of our friends' computers.

56
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,779
Speaker 0: It has nothing to do with the hardware.

57
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,707
Speaker 1: Oh, no, it has nothing to do with the hardware at all.

58
00:03:09,149 --> 00:03:11,380
Speaker 1: But, uh, I'm mostly disparaging our friends.

59
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,832
Speaker 0: Yes, who don't know how to use their computers.

60
00:03:14,254 --> 00:03:15,200
Speaker 0: Or maintain them.

61
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway.

62
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,840
Speaker 0: Well, of course, that's most people, period.

63
00:03:19,421 --> 00:03:20,920
Speaker 0: Well, no, because most- Especially Windows users.

64
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,591
Speaker 1: Most people don't even have a computer.

65
00:03:22,612 --> 00:03:23,740
Speaker 1: I've never even seen a computer.

66
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:25,159
Speaker 0: I guess most people, period, yes.

67
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:25,368
Speaker 0: Yeah.

68
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,201
Speaker 0: So.

69
00:03:26,763 --> 00:03:27,025
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

70
00:03:27,848 --> 00:03:30,400
Speaker 0: I don't have much to say today, other than I'm still kinda sick.

71
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:33,151
Speaker 0: Mostly in the nose, stuffiness area.

72
00:03:33,573 --> 00:03:34,860
Speaker 0: But, uh, I got a little bit of news.

73
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:41,920
Speaker 0: These- If you don't know, there is an award called "S'Spiel des Jahres", which is the Game of the Year.

74
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:45,977
Speaker 0: It's given out in Germany, because that's where all the good games come from.

75
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:46,720
Speaker 0: At least the board games.

76
00:03:47,661 --> 00:03:50,660
Speaker 0: And the nominees for this year's "Spiel des Jahres" have been announced.

77
00:03:51,362 --> 00:03:52,064
Speaker 0: And you know what?

78
00:03:53,088 --> 00:03:54,633
Speaker 0: I don't know any of these games.

79
00:03:54,673 --> 00:03:55,656
Speaker 0: I've never played any of them.

80
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:56,700
Speaker 0: I've never heard of any of them.

81
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,920
Speaker 0: So there's really no point in talking about them.

82
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:04,300
Speaker 0: If you really care, you should go to, like, BoardGameGeek or BoardGameNews.com.

83
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:06,980
Speaker 0: You'll see a list, and you can check out all the games yourself.

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,480
Speaker 1: That was the stupidest news ever!

85
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,417
Speaker 0: That's not my news!

86
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,670
Speaker 1: So, why did you bring it up?

87
00:04:13,153 --> 00:04:14,320
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about it!

88
00:04:14,542 --> 00:04:16,120
Speaker 1: You don't have any insightful commentary?

89
00:04:17,164 --> 00:04:18,779
Speaker 0: Uh, you didn't even let me finish the stupid news.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,720
Speaker 1: No, I didn't, because you already told me what you were gonna say, and I just wanted to be difficult.

91
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, good job.

92
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,119
Speaker 1: Yeah, so continue.

93
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:28,739
Speaker 0: So, this guy wrote this really interesting article about the "Spiel des Jahres".

94
00:04:29,443 --> 00:04:31,293
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Huh, you're right.

95
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:32,158
Speaker 0: It's pretty

96
00:04:32,198 --> 00:04:32,379
Speaker 0: cool.".

97
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:37,577
Speaker 0: And basically what he says is that us, as gamers, we don't really have- I believe you mean we.

98
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:42,340
Speaker 0: Yes, we, as gamers, we have really no stake in the "Spiel des Jahres".

99
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:43,740
Speaker 0: I mean, like, sure, we care.

100
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:51,920
Speaker 0: You know, we'd like to know which game is the winner, because then- And which games are the nominees, because that gives us a better idea of what games are really good.

101
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:54,700
Speaker 0: And traditionally, games that win are really good.

102
00:04:55,241 --> 00:04:56,859
Speaker 0: So, we wanna know who wins.

103
00:04:57,140 --> 00:05:01,080
Speaker 0: But, do we really care if Game A wins, or Game B wins?

104
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:02,679
Speaker 0: I mean, does it really matter to us?

105
00:05:03,321 --> 00:05:04,920
Speaker 0: Nah, nah, it doesn't really matter to me.

106
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,680
Speaker 0: I mean, do I really care?

107
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:13,209
Speaker 0: I mean, maybe one game is already my favorite game, and I want that to win, but- Is that really gonna hurt me?

108
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,319
Speaker 0: I mean, it's already my favorite game, and I already own it.

109
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,840
Speaker 0: So what do I care if it wins in a war or not?

110
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,480
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter anyway, because the games that are up for this, usually, aren't always released in the US until after.

111
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:28,120
Speaker 1: Because the people who bring the games over to the US tend to only bring over the super good games, or the games they know will sell.

112
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:28,601
Speaker 0: Yep.

113
00:05:29,023 --> 00:05:32,160
Speaker 0: So, these games, I don't even have a chance to play them yet, or make them my favorite.

114
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,491
Speaker 0: So, I don't really care which one wins.

115
00:05:34,531 --> 00:05:36,120
Speaker 0: I have no stake in it whatsoever.

116
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,080
Speaker 0: The people making the games have a tremendous stake.

117
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:52,040
Speaker 0: If you make a normal board game, and you release it, it'll get between, I don't know, 500 and 3,000 copies sold in depending on, you know, the quality of the game and how popular it is and whatever.

118
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:57,235
Speaker 0: If it gets nominated for a Spiel des Jahres, you're probably gonna sell 10,000 copies-ish.

119
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,433
Speaker 0: If you win the award as game of the year, you will sell between 300 and 500,000 copies of that game.

120
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,250
Speaker 0: Huh!

121
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:09,224
Speaker 0: That is pretty huge right there.

122
00:06:09,264 --> 00:06:15,739
Speaker 0: It's basically saying, "Yeah, these people who just hand out an award decide which game is gonna

123
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:15,940
Speaker 0: sell.".

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:27,260
Speaker 0: It's like, imagine if they gave the Oscars out before the movies were in theaters, and then everyone would go to see the movie that won the Oscar for best picture, as opposed to the post-hoc fashion.

125
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:35,438
Speaker 1: I can think, there aren't too many games I've truly enjoyed other than momentarily going, "Huh, that was an interesting diversion that we solved in one

126
00:06:35,498 --> 00:06:35,919
Speaker 1: playing.".

127
00:06:36,481 --> 00:06:41,420
Speaker 1: Every game I like is either nominated for or wins the award, with rare exception.

128
00:06:42,220 --> 00:07:00,640
Speaker 0: Yep, they are excellent at choosing, and in this article I'm linking to, this guy points out a few things, and mostly what he says is he goes through a list of all the Spiel des Jahres, 'cause there's no official, like, these are how to win, you know, there's all kinds of different games win it all the time, but he says these are common factors among the winners.

129
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:11,020
Speaker 0: And I bet you, if you made a game that did all the things he finds that are very common factors among games that win this award, you could probably make a game that wins this award.

130
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:22,760
Speaker 0: And I'm willing to bet that a lot of game designers out there in Europe, when they make games, they consider things like this very seriously, because that's how to make a game that's gonna make the big monies.

131
00:07:23,581 --> 00:07:26,734
Speaker 1: Uh, one, I wonder how many of those factors might be mutually exclusive.

132
00:07:26,814 --> 00:07:28,200
Speaker 1: So what are the factors he lists?

133
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:35,978
Speaker 0: Well, some of them he's like, most of the games were between, you know, uh, like, 45 to 90 minute-ish kind of games.

134
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:37,242
Speaker 0: What?

135
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,260
Speaker 1: Almost every German board game is in that range.

136
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,837
Speaker 0: Well no, like, games that were too short, like games that are like five minutes didn't win, and games that were over 120 minutes win.

137
00:07:46,000 --> 00:08:03,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I think that's just a fairly good measure of how good a game is, because a lot of games- Always two to four, two to five, two to six, you know, bigger range of players the better.

138
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:05,351
Speaker 1: You sure it isn't usually three to something?

139
00:08:05,371 --> 00:08:06,780
Speaker 1: Because two player games tend to fail.

140
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:13,260
Speaker 0: Actually no, it's- it's games that have the- it's- it's not just- if your game is only two player, it's not gonna win.

141
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,440
Speaker 0: But if your game has a wide range, like two to six, two to seven, then it's gonna- then it has a better chance.

142
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:25,480
Speaker 1: Now I'm just saying, I find that interesting because a wide range is one thing, but it's very, very difficult to make a game that scales at all, and still allows two player.

143
00:08:26,002 --> 00:08:30,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, well he's talking, you know, games like, uh, the most recent winner, Thurn in Texas, two to four.

144
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:36,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though I really don't like Thurn in Texas, but- Kalis didn't win, but Kalis was what, two to something?

145
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:37,299
Speaker 1: Two to five, I think?

146
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:37,580
Speaker 0: Yeah.

147
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:41,590
Speaker 0: Uh, they don't seem to have a problem with luck in games.

148
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,980
Speaker 0: There's only three games that have ever won that have absolutely no luck whatsoever.

149
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,300
Speaker 0: But, uh, only nine winners have dice in them, and eighteen have some sort of card in them.

150
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:56,700
Speaker 1: Well, I hate to say it, but in general, dice are a sign of a poorly executed game.

151
00:08:57,621 --> 00:08:59,340
Speaker 1: In general, there are exceptions, like Shogun.

152
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:04,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, and, uh, only one game, Liar's Dice, allows player elimination.

153
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:08,740
Speaker 0: So if your game has player elimination, your chances of winning are not so good.

154
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:20,000
Speaker 1: See, player elimination is one of those things that, I love the idea of it, and I'd love to play a game that had that, but at the same time, I understand that it really sucks if you're trying to play the game.

155
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:20,437
Speaker 0: Yep.

156
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,142
Speaker 1: But then again, think of this.

157
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:37,380
Speaker 1: How many times do we have a game where it's obvious- it's not obvious who's going to win, but it is obvious who has already lost, but they have to keep playing, and keep playing well, or to the best of their ability, or the game just doesn't function and you can't continue?

158
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:38,441
Speaker 0: Yep.

159
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:45,200
Speaker 0: The one really interesting thing I found was that just about every winner, uh, has some sort of shtick.

160
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:59,840
Speaker 0: Like, uh, I'm not sure which games of these are winners or not, but the guy uses examples like El Grande with its Castillo, and Niagara with its Waterfall, and, uh, what other games- And what?

161
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,680
Speaker 0: All sorts of other games have shticks like that.

162
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:04,144
Speaker 1: Now what's the line between a shtick and just a game mechanic?

163
00:10:04,164 --> 00:10:12,600
Speaker 1: Because the Castillo is a very straightforward game mechanic of, you can always dump guys in this thing, and you have to keep track in your head because you can't see what's in there.

164
00:10:13,883 --> 00:10:15,920
Speaker 1: What's the line between game mechanic and shtick?

165
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,841
Speaker 0: Oh, I think I didn't read it right.

166
00:10:18,282 --> 00:10:38,680
Speaker 0: He says he tried to figure out if games that had a shtick, uh, or a unique component or mechanism were more likely to win or not, but it wasn't easy for him to determine that because it was hard for him to tell which- which things were actually unique components or mechanisms and which ones were just refinements or reorganizations of other mechanics.

167
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,839
Speaker 1: Exactly what I just said.

168
00:10:40,102 --> 00:10:40,639
Speaker 0: Yes, maybe.

169
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:41,280
Speaker 1: Outstanding.

170
00:10:41,525 --> 00:10:41,615
Speaker 1: Yep.

171
00:10:41,886 --> 00:10:42,339
Speaker 1: So what else?

172
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:45,482
Speaker 0: I don't know, but, uh, read the article for yourself.

173
00:10:45,542 --> 00:10:50,426
Speaker 0: It's really interesting to say, "Ah, look at all these things that these award-winning games have in

174
00:10:50,446 --> 00:10:50,866
Speaker 0: common.".

175
00:10:51,647 --> 00:10:53,428
Speaker 0: Ah, so that's what makes a really good game.

176
00:10:53,649 --> 00:10:54,109
Speaker 0: Or does it?

177
00:10:54,349 --> 00:10:56,251
Speaker 0: Or maybe that's what makes an award-winning game.

178
00:10:56,671 --> 00:11:05,398
Speaker 0: And maybe there's a lot of games that we're missing out on because people are trying to design games to win this award so they can sell 500,000 copies instead of trying to make a better game.

179
00:11:05,438 --> 00:11:07,800
Speaker 0: that maybe does some new and exciting things.

180
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:11,620
Speaker 1: Or do we just not hear about the games that try the new and exciting things because they're not fun?

181
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:12,868
Speaker 0: It could be.

182
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:13,599
Speaker 0: It could be.

183
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:18,685
Speaker 1: So there's some blog, and they wrote about this, which just gives me an excuse to talk about it.

184
00:11:19,186 --> 00:11:25,373
Speaker 1: A lot of people are happy about the quote-unquote "rise" of cooperative play in video games.

185
00:11:26,094 --> 00:11:30,720
Speaker 1: And I think a lot of people now don't realize that cooperative gaming was huge back in the day.

186
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:31,880
Speaker 0: And it fell.

187
00:11:32,281 --> 00:11:33,844
Speaker 1: And it kinda just didn't go anywhere.

188
00:11:34,205 --> 00:11:37,893
Speaker 1: And there was a long period of time when very few games implemented it at all.

189
00:11:37,953 --> 00:11:41,080
Speaker 1: Or if they did, it was definitely tacked on after the fact.

190
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:41,700
Speaker 0: Yep.

191
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:48,536
Speaker 0: I mean, back in the day, for the NES, pretty much just about every game had some sort of co-op.

192
00:11:48,577 --> 00:11:49,479
Speaker 0: if it was two-player.

193
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:49,739
Speaker 0: I mean...

194
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:50,722
Speaker 1: Uh, no.

195
00:11:50,842 --> 00:11:53,530
Speaker 1: I'd say that almost every game was not co-op at all.

196
00:11:53,590 --> 00:11:57,100
Speaker 1: They were two-player, but it was two people playing the game completely independently of one another.

197
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:03,220
Speaker 0: Well, sometimes, but you also had plenty of games like Contra, or Double Dragon, or Kung Fu Heroes...

198
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:08,280
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I don't think that was by any means a majority or even a very large proportion.

199
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:14,507
Speaker 0: It wasn't a majority, but it was not uncommon to have many cooperative games back in those days.

200
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:25,420
Speaker 0: But afterwards, like in the SNES era and beyond, the co-op play, other than in the side-scrolling beat 'em up games, which died, was completely erased.

201
00:12:26,141 --> 00:12:28,066
Speaker 0: Like, no games had co-op at all.

202
00:12:28,386 --> 00:12:33,700
Speaker 0: It used to be, some games had co-op, then just the beat 'em ups, then nothing had co-op.

203
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:35,763
Speaker 1: Actually, a lot of games did have co-op.

204
00:12:35,803 --> 00:12:40,030
Speaker 1: It was more that they didn't really use co-op effectively.

205
00:12:40,251 --> 00:12:45,480
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's funny how there seems to be this craving for co-op play that's just been growing.

206
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:54,020
Speaker 1: Partly in us, not so much in the gaming community as a whole, though I think people are starting to respect the idea of co-op or two people or friends versus the computer.

207
00:12:54,381 --> 00:12:57,954
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, who plays Guitar Hero 2 in the versus mode?

208
00:12:58,035 --> 00:12:59,460
Speaker 0: Everyone plays it in the co-op mode.

209
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,300
Speaker 1: Actually, at Katsucon, they had it in versus mode almost the whole time.

210
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:03,900
Speaker 0: Ah, why?

211
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:05,620
Speaker 1: Because that's what people like to play.

212
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:11,000
Speaker 0: I never met anyone who likes to play the versus mode, unless you're like in a tournament or something.

213
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:14,480
Speaker 1: You never really talk to people who play Guitar Heroes, except our friends.

214
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:18,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know, I got the impression that the co-op mode was the more popular one.

215
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:22,520
Speaker 1: It seems like the co-op mode is really popular in houses, or when you're just hanging out with your friends and playing.

216
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:29,720
Speaker 0: But yeah, I don't know, why is it that we want to do a co-op mode instead of a versus mode?

217
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,127
Speaker 1: That's what I wonder, why is co-op somehow more fulfilling?

218
00:13:32,168 --> 00:13:41,780
Speaker 1: However, I will point out that I've had this urge to play co-op games, but every time I've played a co-op game in recent memory, it's ended up being patently unfun.

219
00:13:42,601 --> 00:13:51,800
Speaker 1: Well, I think- Anytime we played Advance Wars, like a group of us versus the computer, or any of these strategy games against the computer, it just ended up being stupid.

220
00:13:52,262 --> 00:14:00,480
Speaker 0: Well, I think part of that problem with the strategy game against the computer is that you really can't- You either- It's hard to get the difficulty at a setting where it'll be fun.

221
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:10,179
Speaker 0: It's either so easy you just win because you have the combined powers of all your smart friends against the one measly computer, or you give the computer such an advantage that they destroy you.

222
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:12,145
Speaker 1: Actually, I have the opposite problem of.

223
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:20,213
Speaker 1: I don't want all these other units that are taking away resources from my side, acting not in the perfect manner that I've envisioned.

224
00:14:20,856 --> 00:14:21,940
Speaker 1: I don't play well with others.

225
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:29,139
Speaker 0: I think, though, that co-op mode in a lot of these new Xbox 360 FPSs and things is where the action is.

226
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:34,091
Speaker 0: And also, what was that game that they were playing at the Gaming for Hope?

227
00:14:34,171 --> 00:14:37,058
Speaker 0: It was sort of a Smash TV against aliens on the PC?

228
00:14:38,364 --> 00:14:38,920
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

229
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,579
Speaker 0: That was looking like a fun co-op mode to me.

230
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:57,760
Speaker 1: I think the only- See, because there's pros and cons of co-op gaming, like there are any kind of gaming, I think the real allure of co-op gaming, because people are talking about it a lot now and it's really starting to catch on, and a lot of games are using it, is just that it hasn't been seen a lot done well, so it's something unique.

231
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:04,940
Speaker 1: And I don't think it's any intrinsic property of co-op play by itself so much as people haven't really experienced this so much and it's new.

232
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:12,780
Speaker 0: I also think that people tend to just like to play with others, whether actually playing with others adds any sort of meaning to the game.

233
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:15,676
Speaker 0: I mean, look at all the people playing MMOs who are like, "I'll play with my

234
00:15:15,696 --> 00:15:16,118
Speaker 0: friends!".

235
00:15:16,661 --> 00:15:22,780
Speaker 0: So, any kind of game you play with your friends, even if it's not an MMO, it sort of adds things for people, you know?

236
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,720
Speaker 0: Even if it doesn't actually add to the game itself.

237
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:30,680
Speaker 1: I'm just saying, I don't think it adds any more on any sort of objective scale from playing versus with other people.

238
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,183
Speaker 1: Because you're still playing with people.

239
00:15:32,544 --> 00:15:38,860
Speaker 1: A Mario party is a Mario party, regardless of whether you're all working together, or you're on teams, or it's every man for himself.

240
00:15:39,361 --> 00:15:49,480
Speaker 0: I also think there's a lot of people who, you know, they might not be so great at games, but if they team up with their friends, then that'll give them the boost they need to get ahead.

241
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,364
Speaker 1: Oh, there was a lot of that in the dig discussion.

242
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:56,860
Speaker 1: A lot of people were saying that almost every co-op game they ever play is one really good person and all their friends who suck.

243
00:15:57,341 --> 00:16:10,000
Speaker 0: And they tag along to get ahead in the game, or they're the kind of person who is averse to confrontation and battling against another person where they're always going to lose.

244
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:20,660
Speaker 0: But they want their social, and they want to play with other human beings, they just don't want to be against the other human beings, and they have no problem emotionally being against a computer.

245
00:16:21,141 --> 00:16:28,780
Speaker 1: Well, I think the first part of it is more important, because I remember all the times I'd go visit our friend Scott out in his house, and he had all those Star Wars games with the GameCube.

246
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:33,220
Speaker 1: And he really liked them, and I just didn't really like them at all, but he wanted to play them with me.

247
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:41,780
Speaker 1: So we'd play in the co-op kind of, not necessarily straight against each other, but kind of working together mode, because otherwise he'd just destroy me and it wasn't fun.

248
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:49,640
Speaker 1: And that was the only way players of disparate skills can play together, because people seem really averse to handicaps.

249
00:16:50,302 --> 00:16:51,132
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean...

250
00:16:51,840 --> 00:16:56,220
Speaker 1: Granted, I can't stand handicaps, and I'd rather just not play than play with a handicap, or deal with any of that.

251
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,161
Speaker 1: Yeah, I would also

252
00:16:57,201 --> 00:17:10,898
Speaker 0: rather not play than play with a handicap, but I don't know, I think it's just that some gamers, you know, they go all out on a game to the point where their skills are so far above and beyond what anyone else can get, because they're not willing to put a dedication.

253
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:23,520
Speaker 0: Therefore, it's like two people want to play a game, they want to play it with other people, there's not really anyone else around, but their skills are so disparate that they can't play with each other in a way that is fun.

254
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,828
Speaker 0: And if there's a co-op mode, that would make it possible.

255
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:30,500
Speaker 0: And I think that's also part of why co-op mode is becoming more popular.

256
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:36,380
Speaker 1: Well, because I gotta say, the only great co-op experience I ever had were all in Doom and Doom 2.

257
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:37,420
Speaker 0: Counter Strike, NS.

258
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:46,540
Speaker 1: Counter Strike, it was always kind of fake, because it was always co-op, as in, we're cheating against a bunch of other people because we're in the same room.

259
00:17:47,380 --> 00:17:54,720
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, not necessarily, but like, it's a team game, it's a whole bunch of us versus a whole bunch of them, not one versus a whole bunch, like in a one player game.

260
00:17:54,780 --> 00:18:02,740
Speaker 1: I don't know if that's the same as co-op, because it seems like once you have the versus mechanic, then co-op has been strong as ever, because every FPS is that way.

261
00:18:03,222 --> 00:18:08,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's tough to say, I mean, does co-op count if it's a bunch of people on the same team versus a bunch of people on the same team?

262
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:10,700
Speaker 0: Or does it have to be a bunch of people against the computer?

263
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:15,260
Speaker 1: I think it's really just a bunch of people versus the computer, because then, I think the real thing is...

264
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:17,080
Speaker 0: So if you play Counter Strike with bots, is that co-op?

265
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:27,100
Speaker 1: No, because the thing is, if you play through a whole game with a plot or a story or some sort of progression with another person, that is co-op.

266
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:34,060
Speaker 1: If you're just playing with other people toward a common goal in a transient game, it's not co-op, it's just Counter Strike.

267
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,539
Speaker 0: Oh, so like the Crystal Chronicles action.

268
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:39,259
Speaker 1: Crystal Chronicles is definitely co-op.

269
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:42,874
Speaker 0: See, I think the best kind of co-op out there is the Four Swords kind of co-op.

270
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:44,080
Speaker 0: That's where the action is.

271
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:45,920
Speaker 1: Or the Crystal Chronicles, equally good.

272
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:55,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think the thing is that, the reason I put Four Swords ahead of Crystal Chronicles as a game, is that most of the game of Crystal Chronicles is honestly just Gauntlet, walk around, hit the bad guy.

273
00:18:55,961 --> 00:19:03,880
Speaker 0: Whereas Four Swords, the hit the bad guy, is not about leveling items and stuff, it's about Zelda hitting action skill.

274
00:19:04,521 --> 00:19:08,740
Speaker 0: And there's barely any bad guys, it's mostly puzzling and competing over resources.

275
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:21,840
Speaker 1: By the same token though, the Four Swords puzzles are trivial, and the only actual difficulty ever encountered in Four Swords was simply getting your links walking around to all the places you have to go.

276
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,939
Speaker 1: It's just the time it took.

277
00:19:23,501 --> 00:19:38,080
Speaker 0: The thing is, that's the one area where co-op play can do things that no other method of play can do, and that's giving you challenges that require coordination of multiple people at the same time.

278
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,860
Speaker 1: But I also point out that Four Swords is only fun because people can blow each other up and set each other on fire.

279
00:19:43,300 --> 00:19:48,280
Speaker 1: And all the fun things we remember are when the game gets totally derailed after someone gets the fire wand.

280
00:19:48,701 --> 00:19:54,794
Speaker 0: I don't know, that usually sort of annoys me, and I kind of like going through the game and like, "Alright, everyone stand on the Four Squares.

281
00:19:55,094 --> 00:19:55,655
Speaker 0: Where's the key?

282
00:19:55,675 --> 00:19:56,357
Speaker 0: Where's the key?

283
00:19:56,617 --> 00:19:57,459
Speaker 0: Oh, you put the key in the

284
00:19:57,499 --> 00:19:57,720
Speaker 0: door.".

285
00:19:57,941 --> 00:19:59,595
Speaker 0: "Oh my god, I'm gonna fight for all those

286
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:00,059
Speaker 0: rubies.".

287
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:09,500
Speaker 1: I never feel really immersed, and I feel like the rewards of doing better than everyone else or anything in Four Swords wasn't as rewarding as the experience of Crystal Chronicles.

288
00:20:10,522 --> 00:20:15,040
Speaker 0: I feel pretty rewarded playing Four Swords, and mainly I just haven't played enough of it.

289
00:20:15,641 --> 00:20:16,263
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing.

290
00:20:16,303 --> 00:20:19,251
Speaker 1: We've played very small bits of Four Swords over a long period of time.

291
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,560
Speaker 1: We've played all of Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles in one go.

292
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wanted to play Four Swords in one go for the longest time, but it's never happened.

293
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:28,945
Speaker 1: Because no one wants to give up their week.

294
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:35,120
Speaker 1: You know, we're the ones who do the podcast and don't have any free time, yet none of our friends are willing to give up a whole weekend to play video games.

295
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:41,620
Speaker 0: I'm sure it will say that we're gonna do it someday and we'll just be shit talkers and we won't do it until we're retired old men.

296
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:44,500
Speaker 0: I'm sure if they made a DS one we could do it, but oh well.

297
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:46,329
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, I'd do it in a second.

298
00:20:46,409 --> 00:20:48,500
Speaker 1: It's just we can't find two other people to do it.

299
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,043
Speaker 0: I know.

300
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:50,418
Speaker 0: What's his name?

301
00:20:51,180 --> 00:20:55,900
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure Katsu would do it in a second, but he can't play on Saturday, thus defeating the purpose.

302
00:20:56,743 --> 00:20:57,658
Speaker 0: Yep, yep, yep, yep.

303
00:20:58,461 --> 00:20:58,742
Speaker 1: Oh well.

304
00:20:58,923 --> 00:21:01,560
Speaker 1: We should probably just do a show on co-op gaming at this point.

305
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:03,440
Speaker 0: I think there just was a show on co-op gaming.

306
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,022
Speaker 0: Not really.

307
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:08,380
Speaker 1: We skipped over a lot, and we didn't actually defend any of our positions or go into any real detail.

308
00:21:08,961 --> 00:21:09,286
Speaker 0: Oh well.

309
00:21:09,713 --> 00:21:10,119
Speaker 0: That's fine.

310
00:21:16,542 --> 00:21:17,759
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

311
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:26,938
Speaker 1: Now there's a video on YouTube about a Counter-Strike PSA, which is actually pretty funny, partly because if you've ever played Counter-Strike, that happens.

312
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:27,680
Speaker 1: Often.

313
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:35,359
Speaker 1: I can't express to you how many people like to explain to me in Counter-Strike in great detail how high they are right now.

314
00:21:37,081 --> 00:21:38,144
Speaker 1: Man, I'm so high!

315
00:21:38,184 --> 00:21:39,127
Speaker 1: Dude, plant the bomb!

316
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,013
Speaker 1: Smoked a blunt just now!

317
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,397
Speaker 1: Plant the fucking bomb!

318
00:21:42,819 --> 00:21:43,039
Speaker 1: Woooo!

319
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:51,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, at first, based on the title of the video, I thought it was something I had already seen in the past.

320
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,746
Speaker 0: And when I started watching it, I was like, "I've seen this

321
00:21:53,786 --> 00:21:54,167
Speaker 0: before.".

322
00:21:54,548 --> 00:21:57,517
Speaker 0: But then the punchline came, and I'm like, "Oh, I haven't seen this one.

323
00:21:57,678 --> 00:21:58,179
Speaker 1: Ah-ha, it's

324
00:21:58,219 --> 00:21:58,420
Speaker 1: funny.".

325
00:21:58,521 --> 00:21:59,700
Speaker 1: But that's not my thing of the day.

326
00:22:00,105 --> 00:22:00,578
Speaker 1: Oh, it's not.

327
00:22:01,001 --> 00:22:08,300
Speaker 1: While I watched that, I clicked on the dig comments, looking for related things, because lately people seem to always post the better thing that for some reason didn't get dug up.

328
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:11,500
Speaker 1: And sure enough, in there, I found a link to this video.

329
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:20,720
Speaker 1: Which, get past the first bit where nothing's going on, wait until he starts talking, and don't worry about the fact that his talking quality is not the highest.

330
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:21,900
Speaker 0: And his voice is very nerdy.

331
00:22:22,301 --> 00:22:30,560
Speaker 1: Because this is probably 50% comic gold and 50% lame, but the comic gold is such good comic gold.

332
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:37,040
Speaker 0: And everything he says, "Comic gold or not," is a 100% accurate description of the game of Counter-Strike.

333
00:22:37,881 --> 00:22:41,210
Speaker 0: And if you've played Counter-Strike, then you'll say, "Oh, yup, that's

334
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:41,631
Speaker 0: accurate.".

335
00:22:41,792 --> 00:22:44,279
Speaker 0: And if you haven't played it, you'll go, "Oh, so that's what that game's

336
00:22:44,319 --> 00:22:44,499
Speaker 0: like.".

337
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:50,420
Speaker 1: This is definitely a case of, the writing's great, the concept's great, you just need someone to execute it better.

338
00:22:50,901 --> 00:22:58,400
Speaker 1: If one of you out there take all the jokes he made, condense them, and do a stand-up routine, it would be genius.

339
00:23:00,222 --> 00:23:03,000
Speaker 0: I like the part best where he starts talking about all the different weapons.

340
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,554
Speaker 0: He's like, "Yeah, take the MP5, make it weaker in every possible way and more

341
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,156
Speaker 0: expensive.".

342
00:23:08,397 --> 00:23:09,160
Speaker 0: And that's the UMP.

343
00:23:11,421 --> 00:23:12,965
Speaker 0: He's like, "Yeah, get the TMP.

344
00:23:14,148 --> 00:23:17,978
Speaker 0: People who use it will say that it has a high rate of fire, good accuracy, and a fast

345
00:23:18,019 --> 00:23:18,360
Speaker 0: reload.".

346
00:23:18,741 --> 00:23:19,904
Speaker 0: All of those things are correct.

347
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:26,200
Speaker 0: But, in order to do even one point of damage, you need to hit 40 rounds directly in the head of your enemy.

348
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:31,900
Speaker 1: I don't know, the part where he starts emulating how you were supposed to react whenever you ever get shot.

349
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,624
Speaker 1: "Oh my god, what the fuck?

350
00:23:33,904 --> 00:23:34,646
Speaker 1: Fuck this game!

351
00:23:34,707 --> 00:23:35,328
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike is

352
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:35,970
Speaker 1: bullshit!".

353
00:23:36,692 --> 00:23:39,299
Speaker 1: And yet, you keep playing for four more hours.

354
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's good stuff.

355
00:23:41,602 --> 00:23:42,820
Speaker 1: It's definitely worth watching.

356
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,319
Speaker 0: Makes you want to play Counter-Strike again.

357
00:23:44,561 --> 00:23:50,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, Counter-Strike is probably going to be the first game I play once the new computer's up and going.

358
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,139
Speaker 0: Yep, I'll boot it back up.

359
00:23:52,361 --> 00:23:53,900
Speaker 1: Well, after GLX Gears.

360
00:23:54,240 --> 00:24:06,600
Speaker 0: I mean, now that I'm mostly using for computing my laptop and my computer at work, my desktop at home really isn't getting used at all except for downloading torrents and then transferring them to the computer downstairs.

361
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,265
Speaker 1: You wanna play Counter-Strike with me?

362
00:24:08,285 --> 00:24:12,020
Speaker 1: We'll both go join a server and see how much skill we've lost in the last seven years.

363
00:24:12,181 --> 00:24:13,453
Speaker 0: I predict we've lost 99% of the skills.

364
00:24:14,624 --> 00:24:15,780
Speaker 1: I don't know, we were pretty badass.

365
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:17,946
Speaker 0: We were pretty badass in the olden days.

366
00:24:17,986 --> 00:24:20,800
Speaker 0: I've tried to play Counter-Strike Source a couple times and I just got owned.

367
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,071
Speaker 1: Oh, Source is for losers.

368
00:24:22,131 --> 00:24:23,461
Speaker 1: I played 1.6.

369
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:25,492
Speaker 0: I know, but I tried to play that too when I got owned.

370
00:24:25,934 --> 00:24:26,920
Speaker 0: It was like months ago.

371
00:24:27,563 --> 00:24:28,079
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see.

372
00:24:29,141 --> 00:24:35,256
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Source, while I don't think it's got some problems, it's not perfect, I don't think it's that bad.

373
00:24:35,276 --> 00:24:36,940
Speaker 0: It's not just this useless game.

374
00:24:37,341 --> 00:24:41,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, but everything I read, people seem to say that 1.6 is just a lot more refined.

375
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:45,557
Speaker 0: Are those the same people who are playing and they get killed and they go, "Oh man, Counter-Strike

376
00:24:45,577 --> 00:24:45,899
Speaker 0: sucks!".

377
00:24:46,701 --> 00:24:48,615
Speaker 0: They play Counter-Strike Source and they go, "Oh man, this game

378
00:24:48,655 --> 00:24:48,978
Speaker 0: sucks!".

379
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:54,060
Speaker 1: I think I've decided that all those people in Counter-Strike, they don't go anywhere else on the internet.

380
00:24:54,661 --> 00:24:58,420
Speaker 1: As far as I can see, they exist solely in Counter-Strike.

381
00:24:58,621 --> 00:24:59,055
Speaker 1: It could be.

382
00:25:00,101 --> 00:25:04,480
Speaker 1: I think that, if anything, the only other place those people exist is YouTube comments.

383
00:25:06,661 --> 00:25:10,540
Speaker 0: Alright, so I had a little trouble finding a gaming thing of the day, so I didn't even bother.

384
00:25:11,403 --> 00:25:14,636
Speaker 0: I found this really cool video called "The Wall of

385
00:25:14,736 --> 00:25:15,098
Speaker 0: Death."

386
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:15,785
Speaker 0: Death!

387
00:25:17,161 --> 00:25:20,040
Speaker 0: And basically, this is just frickin' people being awesome.

388
00:25:20,461 --> 00:25:21,220
Speaker 1: It's Braveheart.

389
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:21,741
Speaker 0: Yes.

390
00:25:21,881 --> 00:25:23,286
Speaker 0: So, here's the scene.

391
00:25:23,828 --> 00:25:24,671
Speaker 0: A metal concert.

392
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:26,257
Speaker 0: An outdoor metal concert.

393
00:25:26,357 --> 00:25:27,100
Speaker 0: The big kind.

394
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:30,740
Speaker 0: Where it's just, you know, a giant stage and a sea of people.

395
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:36,220
Speaker 0: There's a big clearing in the middle of the sea of people that they have constructed on purpose.

396
00:25:36,961 --> 00:25:38,911
Speaker 0: They know what song is about to be played.

397
00:25:39,052 --> 00:25:45,959
Speaker 0: If anyone knows the metal band, by the way, I'm sure some people I know out there know what song it is and what band it is, but I don't know.

398
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:52,940
Speaker 0: And they know that the song starts off, you know, duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh-duh, and then suddenly goes duh-duh-duh-duh-duh with the crazy part.

399
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,600
Speaker 0: You know, how metal songs go, where they have the intense part.

400
00:25:56,121 --> 00:26:06,220
Speaker 0: And they get ready, and as soon as the intense part hits, both people on both sides of the clearing run at each other with full steam.

401
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,880
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the cameraman gets knocked down and the camera broken.

402
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:13,359
Speaker 0: I don't know, but the film survived and is on the YouTubes.

403
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:13,762
Speaker 0: Yes.

404
00:26:13,803 --> 00:26:15,339
Speaker 0: I guess the Break.com.

405
00:26:15,944 --> 00:26:16,880
Speaker 1: Oh, you mean the fake YouTube.

406
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,520
Speaker 0: The fake YouTube wannabe site.

407
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,340
Speaker 1: I really hate all those fake YouTubes, because a lot of them don't work well.

408
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:27,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, my only problem, I don't have any problem with someone trying to make a site that does the same thing YouTube does.

409
00:26:27,923 --> 00:26:32,900
Speaker 0: My problem is, if you're going to try to compete with YouTube, because obviously they're trying to compete with YouTube.

410
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:33,839
Speaker 0: YouTube was there first.

411
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:36,720
Speaker 0: These guys are, you know, Johnny-come-latelys.

412
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,060
Speaker 0: It's not like they were there before YouTube or anything.

413
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,700
Speaker 0: You should do better than YouTube in some way.

414
00:26:43,321 --> 00:26:44,538
Speaker 0: You shouldn't do worse.

415
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:48,289
Speaker 0: That's like saying, "Oh, Apple in your iPod, eh?

416
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:49,433
Speaker 0: I could beat that.

417
00:26:49,734 --> 00:26:50,336
Speaker 0: Check out this

418
00:26:50,616 --> 00:26:51,158
Speaker 0: Zune.".

419
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:52,660
Speaker 0: Are we done with things of the day?

420
00:26:53,004 --> 00:26:53,235
Speaker 1: Probably.

421
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:53,711
Speaker 0: Alright.

422
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:56,319
Speaker 1: So, getting into German board games.

423
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:03,335
Speaker 0: Someone last week when we were doing Getting Into It Week was like, "Oh, I thought you guys were going to be getting into German board games.

424
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:03,878
Speaker 0: I was glad you

425
00:27:03,898 --> 00:27:04,119
Speaker 0: didn't.".

426
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,539
Speaker 0: Well, we're doing it now.

427
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,900
Speaker 1: Alright, first off, it's very simple.

428
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:17,160
Speaker 1: One, if there is a gaming convention near you, and they're all almost identical, go to it, find the German gaming room, it's probably there.

429
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:19,199
Speaker 1: If it isn't, then it's a really crappy gaming con.

430
00:27:20,421 --> 00:27:23,380
Speaker 1: Find anyone and ask them if they'll play a game with you.

431
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:24,879
Speaker 1: They'll probably say yes.

432
00:27:25,221 --> 00:27:30,940
Speaker 1: If you can't find anyone at the con, ask the guy minding the board games if he'll play a game with you.

433
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:32,378
Speaker 1: He'll probably say yes.

434
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:40,420
Speaker 0: Also, there are usually scheduled games, like someone will say, "Hey, I have this game at X o'clock at table 3.

435
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,018
Speaker 0: Go to table 3 at X o'clock and sign your name, and you get to

436
00:27:44,038 --> 00:27:44,319
Speaker 0: play.".

437
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,067
Speaker 0: And they'll teach you how.

438
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:49,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, not only will they teach you how, they're really good at teaching you how.

439
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:52,940
Speaker 1: It'll be a bunch of other newbies probably too, and you'll have an awesome time.

440
00:27:52,940 --> 00:28:00,313
Speaker 0: As long as it's listed as being a nub game, usually if it doesn't say anything on it, it just says, "We're playing this game at this time at this table,".

441
00:28:00,695 --> 00:28:01,660
Speaker 0: then you can go to it.

442
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:05,118
Speaker 0: You only have to worry if it says "experienced player

443
00:28:05,158 --> 00:28:05,460
Speaker 0: game."

444
00:28:05,561 --> 00:28:06,640
Speaker 0: But you almost never will.

445
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,280
Speaker 0: You almost never will.

446
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:09,980
Speaker 1: The only time you have to worry, don't join it if it says tournament.

447
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:17,360
Speaker 1: Otherwise, if it's any German board game, it's definitely nub friendly, because German board gamers love nothing more than to teach a new person their game.

448
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:25,040
Speaker 1: Now, if there's no gaming cons around you, or if you have a choice of what game to play at the gaming con, we're not going to beat around the bush.

449
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:31,180
Speaker 1: You should play German board games in this order and exactly this order with little deviation.

450
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,719
Speaker 1: First, play Settlers of Catan.

451
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:40,560
Speaker 1: It is by and for large, perfectly the best game possible to teach you what German board gaming is about.

452
00:28:40,942 --> 00:28:42,640
Speaker 0: It is not a good long-term game.

453
00:28:42,780 --> 00:28:47,700
Speaker 0: In the long term, playing that game, you will become bored with it, even though some people don't, and it amazes me.

454
00:28:48,446 --> 00:28:49,920
Speaker 1: Well, the game is fundamentally broken.

455
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:59,360
Speaker 1: And one of the big steps of becoming a really good German board gamer is the moment you realize why Settlers of Catan is broken, and realize why you're not having fun anymore.

456
00:28:59,741 --> 00:29:01,780
Speaker 1: Because at that moment, you're ready to play Puerto Rico.

457
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:23,920
Speaker 0: But regardless, Settlers of Catan, it'll teach you trading, it teaches you... It's a game where, if the players are not all already solved the game, it is actually mostly a game of an amount of skill, if no one has the maxed out skill yet, and it teaches you a lot of things you need to know to play other German board games.

458
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:31,840
Speaker 1: It also brings in all the basic concepts of these kinds of games, where the decisions you're making are non-trivial, or at least feel non-trivial.

459
00:29:32,441 --> 00:29:33,840
Speaker 1: And the decisions you're making matter.

460
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:38,040
Speaker 1: There's not a lot of randomness, even though in Settlers there's the dice mechanic.

461
00:29:38,481 --> 00:29:41,779
Speaker 1: But you won't realize how bad that is until later, so don't worry about it.

462
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:47,640
Speaker 0: And you get, mostly, you get all the thematic things of German board games.

463
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:55,660
Speaker 0: You know, this is a game where you're settling an island of Catan, and trying to beat the other Settlers and having the best settlement.

464
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:58,080
Speaker 1: Mostly by trading brick for wood.

465
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,920
Speaker 1: You need wood because you have a lot of sheep, and not enough wood to do something to those sheep.

466
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:03,462
Speaker 0: Hey,

467
00:30:03,542 --> 00:30:03,623
Speaker 0: R.M.,

468
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:04,490
Speaker 0: you got sheep?

469
00:30:04,651 --> 00:30:05,680
Speaker 0: 'Cause I got wood for 'em.

470
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:08,240
Speaker 1: I got plenty of sheep, you're not going anywhere near your wood.

471
00:30:09,106 --> 00:30:10,379
Speaker 0: Ah, but I got wood for sheep.

472
00:30:10,843 --> 00:30:12,980
Speaker 1: I'm gonna cram the sheep into a brick instead.

473
00:30:13,782 --> 00:30:14,720
Speaker 0: Ah, I don't want brick.

474
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:15,739
Speaker 1: Y'all got a brick?

475
00:30:16,161 --> 00:30:17,230
Speaker 0: I only have grain.

476
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:17,331
Speaker 0: Okay.

477
00:30:17,452 --> 00:30:17,714
Speaker 0: But yeah.

478
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:30,340
Speaker 1: Plus, the game's a really good social game, because it's one of those rare games that does, at least until everyone's an experienced player, it almost forces everyone to be social within the construct of the game.

479
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,820
Speaker 1: You have to trade in the game with other players in order to succeed.

480
00:30:35,081 --> 00:30:41,200
Speaker 0: You also, on certain opportunities, have to hurt other players in terms of the game.

481
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:44,380
Speaker 0: You rob them, or you attack them with a soldier.

482
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people- Or you use your roads to cut them off.

483
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:59,999
Speaker 1: A lot of people who get into German games or real games, as opposed to the more American-style board game, early on, they seem to have this aversion to straight-up just screwing another player, or harming another player directly.

484
00:31:00,461 --> 00:31:24,360
Speaker 1: I mean, how many times were you a kid playing, I don't know, Sorry or Monopoly with your family or your friends, and you saw a move that would clearly harm the person who's winning and put you in the lead, and you either didn't do it because you felt bad about it, or you did it and your family or friends yelled at you for being an unfair player, or a bad player, or a bad sport, or mean, or they took it personally.

485
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:26,160
Speaker 1: And there's really this aversion.

486
00:31:26,682 --> 00:31:28,040
Speaker 1: You can't have that in German games.

487
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,540
Speaker 1: In German games, to win, you have to take direct action against other players sometimes.

488
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:35,380
Speaker 0: I mean, not every game involves direct action.

489
00:31:35,821 --> 00:31:39,400
Speaker 0: There are in fact many German board games where there is no way to hurt anyone else.

490
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:42,260
Speaker 0: They're just races to get the most points most quickly.

491
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:48,920
Speaker 1: However, many of those games are zero-sum, so you do in fact hurt other players anytime you take an action, but that's much more indirect.

492
00:31:49,400 --> 00:32:02,920
Speaker 0: Yes, but there are games where you either directly or indirectly hurt other players within the context of the game, and you have to get used to that, and in Settlers, that mechanic exists a bit, and it will help you get used to that.

493
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:13,240
Speaker 1: But at the same time, the mechanic in Settlers is so mild that it's a nice stepping point between not screwing other players and the full-on atabisi.

494
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,659
Speaker 0: I was wondering how you were going to say that.

495
00:32:18,922 --> 00:32:21,220
Speaker 1: So, I mean, I can't say more than that.

496
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:25,160
Speaker 0: And it's on Xbox Live right now, and it's also on the internet in many places.

497
00:32:25,241 --> 00:32:26,460
Speaker 0: You can just play this game.

498
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:34,600
Speaker 1: Yes, if you want to get into German gaming, and you have an Xbox 360, play Settlers of Catan on your Xbox right now.

499
00:32:35,323 --> 00:32:37,060
Speaker 1: If you haven't already gotten it, you're a fool.

500
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,307
Speaker 1: This is the best way to get into German gaming.

501
00:32:39,327 --> 00:32:42,779
Speaker 1: that is ever going to be presented to you, unless you live near us.

502
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:51,320
Speaker 0: After you play Settlers, you've got to play another game, because you're not going to be excited playing one game over and over again, are you?

503
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:58,000
Speaker 1: Well, plus, once you play Settlers, because I remember very specifically the first time I actually played Settlers of Catan.

504
00:32:58,642 --> 00:33:01,799
Speaker 1: And I lost horribly, but I started figuring out what was going on.

505
00:33:02,401 --> 00:33:07,420
Speaker 1: And afterwards, I started having this craving for games, the likes of which I've never known before.

506
00:33:08,181 --> 00:33:14,880
Speaker 1: And then I went to Millennium Games and discovered that, wow, not only is there more than one of these games, but there's hundreds.

507
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,137
Speaker 0: There are lots and lots of games.

508
00:33:17,681 --> 00:33:24,400
Speaker 1: You're going to want to play a lot of games like this in a hurry, because Settlers is going to -- it's the marijuana of board games.

509
00:33:24,780 --> 00:33:28,839
Speaker 0: It's going to drag you in, and before you realize it -- Because marijuana, we know, doesn't actually do that, but that's not the point.

510
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,840
Speaker 1: No, no, as far as Nancy Reagan is concerned, it's the marijuana of board games.

511
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,315
Speaker 0: There you go.

512
00:33:33,961 --> 00:33:35,491
Speaker 1: So, what game do you play next?

513
00:33:35,913 --> 00:33:36,900
Speaker 1: The answer is Carcassonne.

514
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,323
Speaker 0: Yep, Carcassonne.

515
00:33:38,443 --> 00:33:44,360
Speaker 0: The problem is, is when you have that craving to play all kinds of German games, you don't know what to buy, though, because you're not into it yet.

516
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,042
Speaker 0: You don't know.

517
00:33:45,484 --> 00:33:50,140
Speaker 0: You're just this nub, and you know Settlers, and you know what games look cool, but that's about it.

518
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,615
Speaker 0: So you're probably -- if you just went out to buy a game off the shelf, you'd probably get something crappy.

519
00:33:54,736 --> 00:33:55,338
Speaker 0: At least the odds are.

520
00:33:55,358 --> 00:33:55,840
Speaker 0: you get something crappy.

521
00:33:55,880 --> 00:34:03,980
Speaker 1: Or you'll get something that is really -- I hate to say an advanced game, like, "Oh, you're not ready to play this game," because that's crap.

522
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:13,280
Speaker 1: But at the same time, some games are really painful or hurtful or not fun to play unless you're an experienced board gamer.

523
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:23,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's like, if I played Tigris and Euphrates before I played any other German game, it probably just, like -- even though I may or may not have had fun, I may or may not have understood it.

524
00:34:23,739 --> 00:34:29,100
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, if you learn how to read and the first thing you read is Ulysses, it's not going to work out.

525
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:38,920
Speaker 0: You know, whether Ulysses is good or bad, I can't say, but you need to have a certain level of stuff within you before you're ready to be entertained by that.

526
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,822
Speaker 1: I mean, here's an example.

527
00:34:39,862 --> 00:34:48,860
Speaker 1: If I had tried to play Age of Steam five years ago instead of last year, I probably would have hated that game and hated German board gaming.

528
00:34:49,681 --> 00:34:52,460
Speaker 1: But instead, I respect that game for what it is and I enjoy it.

529
00:34:52,679 --> 00:35:01,440
Speaker 0: It's not like how a lot of people, it's like they want to start reading comics or manga or something and they read something bad and then they're just turned off by the whole idea of it.

530
00:35:01,540 --> 00:35:04,230
Speaker 0: Or the first movie they see is some ass movies.

531
00:35:04,270 --> 00:35:05,736
Speaker 0: They're just, "Bah, movies!

532
00:35:05,796 --> 00:35:06,378
Speaker 0: I don't need

533
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:06,619
Speaker 0: them.".

534
00:35:06,820 --> 00:35:08,687
Speaker 0: You know, and it's like, "You told me what?

535
00:35:08,747 --> 00:35:11,637
Speaker 0: You know, a bad experience at the get-go is no

536
00:35:11,698 --> 00:35:11,918
Speaker 0: good.".

537
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:16,135
Speaker 0: But the thing you had a bad experience with may not necessarily be a bad thing.

538
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,239
Speaker 0: Of course, it could be.

539
00:35:17,681 --> 00:35:20,520
Speaker 0: But you might have been just, you weren't ready for it yet.

540
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:27,260
Speaker 1: And also, in terms of this whole getting-into-it-week idea, we're going to try something here -- well, we're already trying it.

541
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:35,140
Speaker 1: We've got to be really simple because I've noticed a lot of people when they're looking for a how-to guide or anything like that on the internet, they don't want explanation so much.

542
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,847
Speaker 1: And they tend to avoid anything that goes into great detail.

543
00:35:38,148 --> 00:35:42,380
Speaker 1: They want to step-by-step do this, then this, then this, then this, and you're done without taking away the decisions.

544
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,580
Speaker 1: It's like Ubuntu versus Gen 2.

545
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:51,660
Speaker 0: But the problem is, I think that when people do that, they're actually harming themselves because you end up not actually learning anything.

546
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,968
Speaker 0: You just end up accomplishing a task without bettering yourself in any way.

547
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:59,595
Speaker 0: Or really, I don't think you're really accomplishing the full task.

548
00:35:59,635 --> 00:36:02,080
Speaker 0: You're doing less than you would be doing otherwise.

549
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:10,500
Speaker 1: But at the same time, when it comes to getting into German board games, I think that if we just give a straight-up list and order of games, it can be very helpful.

550
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:14,869
Speaker 1: Because we've played so many games.

551
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:19,460
Speaker 1: German board gaming is such an important part of our lives, it's almost frightening.

552
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:26,620
Speaker 1: And I think we're at the level, I really don't want to sound pretentious here, I hate that sort of thing.

553
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,280
Speaker 0: You're pretentious.

554
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:38,664
Speaker 1: But I think we're at the point where we could say, here is a list of games, and if you play these games in roughly this order, you will come out of it a well-rounded German gamer who will very much- If you like it.

555
00:36:38,685 --> 00:36:39,558
Speaker 0: I mean, you might not like it.

556
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:54,320
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but if you do enjoy these games, I think this is not necessarily the best way or not necessarily the only way, but a way to experience gaming in the way we experienced it, and to be brought into it in a well-rounded way.

557
00:36:54,760 --> 00:37:03,080
Speaker 1: To where, when you've finished playing our list, you will now know what you like and dislike about different kinds of games, and you'll be on very good footing to become a great German board gamer.

558
00:37:03,840 --> 00:37:06,713
Speaker 0: Well, the next game you want to play is Carcassonne.

559
00:37:07,175 --> 00:37:08,340
Speaker 0: It's actually a French game.

560
00:37:09,261 --> 00:37:13,500
Speaker 1: I'd say it's also a pretty good game to be your first game if Settlers is not available.

561
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:19,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, Carcassonne, it was for sale in Toys R Us and Barnes and Nobles at a time, and pretty much this.

562
00:37:20,011 --> 00:37:25,300
Speaker 0: and Settlers are not only the games you should start with, but they're the most easily available games out there.

563
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:27,343
Speaker 0: Odds are you're going to find them.

564
00:37:27,623 --> 00:37:35,760
Speaker 0: I mean, sure, I guess compared to Monopoly and Scrabble and whatever, you're not going to find them, but you will be able to find these even if you have just a slightly nerdy store.

565
00:37:36,302 --> 00:37:41,940
Speaker 0: I mean, it's not uncommon to just find them in a store that sells mostly comics and then a box of Settlers.

566
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:48,800
Speaker 1: Yep, now Carcassonne will introduce you to tile laying, tile placement, all the tile kind of things, and there's a lot of tile games.

567
00:37:49,541 --> 00:37:51,180
Speaker 1: It takes away the direct screwing.

568
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,060
Speaker 0: But it adds a lot of indirect screwing.

569
00:37:53,200 --> 00:38:02,300
Speaker 1: Yes, it is a game that you can play it on a very simple level and enjoy it greatly, but there is a lot of unseen depth there.

570
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:05,732
Speaker 1: And Carcassonne is a game that, I mean, it's one of our early games.

571
00:38:05,772 --> 00:38:08,000
Speaker 1: We played it right away before we played all these other games.

572
00:38:08,421 --> 00:38:13,880
Speaker 1: And even in this day, even today, Carcassonne is still a complex and engaging game, even for us.

573
00:38:14,221 --> 00:38:17,840
Speaker 1: Yet, it is equally enjoyable to someone who's never played a German board game before.

574
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:23,840
Speaker 0: Yep, it's also going to be on Xbox Live if the rumor is correct, and there's many ways you can play it online and whatever.

575
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:26,711
Speaker 1: I don't really want to make this go too long.

576
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:28,640
Speaker 1: I don't want to end up reviewing all of these games.

577
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:29,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's not review the games.

578
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,303
Speaker 1: Yes, but Carcassonne is next.

579
00:38:31,363 --> 00:38:38,000
Speaker 1: Now, after you have played and come to enjoy Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne, there's a lot of directions you could go from there.

580
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:42,040
Speaker 1: Personally, we ended up with El Grande and then Puerto Rico.

581
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:42,504
Speaker 1: Yep.

582
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,298
Speaker 1: That's a little bit of a steep curve, but at the same time...

583
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:46,439
Speaker 0: El Grande is not so steep.

584
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:55,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think the jump, El Grande, Puerto Rico, it'll really hit you, but at the same time, it'll really bring you into the fullness of German board gaming.

585
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:05,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, the first times I played Puerto Rico at that gaming club with those guys, like, I was playing it, but I couldn't really see what was a good move, what was a bad move.

586
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,900
Speaker 0: I was playing it really crappily, and I didn't get much done.

587
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:16,040
Speaker 1: Our strategies in Puerto Rico and our knowledge of Puerto Rico evolved over the course of four or five years of playing.

588
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:20,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I had fun playing the game, but I wasn't, like, I didn't know.

589
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,120
Speaker 1: I couldn't have been five years, it was like four years.

590
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:27,380
Speaker 0: I couldn't really get the game in my brain, like, what to do and how to win and how to get more points.

591
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:34,540
Speaker 0: I just played it and had fun playing it, you know, hanging around a table, saying funny things about the settler and the mayor and stuff.

592
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:37,260
Speaker 0: Until we played it ten times a day.

593
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:41,939
Speaker 1: Yep, but I really would say, a lot of people don't like this game, but I personally really like it.

594
00:39:42,462 --> 00:39:46,200
Speaker 1: The good next step after those two games, if you can get a copy of it, is El Grande.

595
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:47,877
Speaker 0: El Grande is an okay game.

596
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:54,500
Speaker 1: El Grande is a good game for early to middling German board gamers, because there's a lot to do.

597
00:39:55,001 --> 00:39:56,719
Speaker 1: It's one of the wooden cubes games.

598
00:39:57,340 --> 00:40:02,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, it's like there's a bunch of buckets, and they're not actually buckets, they're just metaphorical buckets.

599
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:05,000
Speaker 0: They're countries or provinces of Spain or whatever.

600
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:10,680
Speaker 0: And you put the cubes into them, and you're trying to get more cubes into more buckets than other people have.

601
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:20,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean basically, Settlers of Catan and Carcassonne are somewhat simple, have a limited number of game mechanics, and really kind of teach you what these games are about.

602
00:40:21,020 --> 00:40:28,480
Speaker 1: El Grande combines a great many of the popular game mechanics into one game, and mashes them all together.

603
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:41,780
Speaker 1: And it feels extremely complicated, and there's a lot going on, and there's a lot to do, and you can play it with a lot of people, and there's a lot of bargaining and second guessing, and there's the Castille and all this fun stuff to do and fun game mechanics.

604
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:46,300
Speaker 1: They've got all these cubes and spinners and sliders and wheels and score mechanisms and...

605
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,072
Speaker 0: Cubes.

606
00:40:47,680 --> 00:40:55,839
Speaker 1: It basically pulls you into this other level of board game, where you can see, you've seen how simple the games can be, and now you see how complex the games can be.

607
00:40:56,521 --> 00:41:05,480
Speaker 1: It's also very very fun, and while it does have its flaws, they won't become apparent for a long time, and we played El Grande a lot, for a couple of years.

608
00:41:06,142 --> 00:41:10,300
Speaker 0: And then we just sort of gave up on it as other games put it out of the way.

609
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:20,620
Speaker 1: Though I gotta say, bringing it out and playing it again after all these years, after having played all these other much more difficult games, El Grande is still a good game, but for entirely different reasons.

610
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:24,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of fun, but it's not like.

611
00:41:24,676 --> 00:41:25,660
Speaker 0: I remember it, you know?

612
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:28,700
Speaker 1: Well I remember it, but I played it a lot more than you did.

613
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:35,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't really do it for me in the way that it did it for me in the past, and it can be fun, but I think it's still pretty fun.

614
00:41:36,283 --> 00:41:37,720
Speaker 1: It's not really that broken.

615
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:38,600
Speaker 1: It's a little broken.

616
00:41:38,740 --> 00:41:40,059
Speaker 1: No, it's broken in three player.

617
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:40,700
Speaker 0: Yeah.

618
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:43,040
Speaker 1: The five player game is really not so broken.

619
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, eh, maybe.

620
00:41:44,981 --> 00:41:47,200
Speaker 0: But that might just be obfuscated brokenness.

621
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,500
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it is at all.

622
00:41:49,043 --> 00:41:49,500
Speaker 1: Oh, whatever.

623
00:41:49,620 --> 00:41:52,620
Speaker 1: Besides, if you want to get to that mechanic, all board games are fundamentally broken.

624
00:41:53,020 --> 00:41:53,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, I get some level.

625
00:41:54,420 --> 00:42:01,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just a matter of what point you realize they're broken, and can you use that brokenness to always win against people who don't realize it's broken?

626
00:42:01,301 --> 00:42:07,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Go is broken if your brain is a supercomputer that is more powerful than all supercomputers ever created combined.

627
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:14,580
Speaker 1: But if you don't, if you can't find or don't want to play El Grande, I would recommend Puerto Rico.

628
00:42:15,220 --> 00:42:25,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Puerto Rico is pretty much the game of games, and don't be threatened by it because we talk about it like, "Oh, it's this wonderful, amazing game that is the best game ever,

629
00:42:25,938 --> 00:42:26,679
Speaker 0: blah-bity-blah.".

630
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:31,253
Speaker 0: Because while it is, it's not really that hard to learn how to play.

631
00:42:31,313 --> 00:42:33,500
Speaker 0: It's not like something only smart people can play.

632
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:36,920
Speaker 0: You can play it if you're just kind of new to games, actually.

633
00:42:37,100 --> 00:42:43,240
Speaker 0: You just, you won't understand why it's so great, and you won't do well at it unless you know what's going on.

634
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:50,060
Speaker 1: Yes, what I would highly recommend, if you can, is get someone else to teach you how to play Puerto Rico, which is not difficult.

635
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:55,620
Speaker 1: Any gaming convention will have that one guy who will teach you how to play Puerto Rico and then play a game with you.

636
00:42:55,901 --> 00:43:00,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is, the problem I have, is that if someone wants me to teach them how to play, I will tell them the rules.

637
00:43:01,460 --> 00:43:04,759
Speaker 0: But if I actually end up playing against them, I won't help them.

638
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:10,136
Speaker 0: But if I wasn't playing in that game, then I'd be like, "Oh, do this because of that.

639
00:43:10,257 --> 00:43:11,019
Speaker 0: Oh, do this because of

640
00:43:11,059 --> 00:43:11,200
Speaker 0: that.".

641
00:43:11,260 --> 00:43:16,000
Speaker 0: And then they would learn more, but they end up usually playing against me, and then I don't help them.

642
00:43:16,220 --> 00:43:17,773
Speaker 0: Because I'm not helping someone I'm playing against.

643
00:43:17,793 --> 00:43:18,579
Speaker 0: This is not going to happen.

644
00:43:20,041 --> 00:43:33,820
Speaker 1: Now, once you've played all these games, you know, either El Grande or Puerto Rico, I'd say the next step, and this is still probably my favorite game ever, even though I still think that Puerto Rico is a better game, Tigris and Euphrates.

645
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, Teenies, where it's at, man.

646
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:51,280
Speaker 1: I think Tigris and Euphrates is not, it can't be the pinnacle or the peak or anything like that, but it is a game that has such enduring qualities and such enduring power, and it's a game where the strategies are so simple and yet so infuriatingly complex.

647
00:43:52,140 --> 00:44:01,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I played this, again, I taught this to some random people once at a gaming store, and when we were done, they were like, "Huh, this seems kind of like an ancient

648
00:44:01,337 --> 00:44:01,659
Speaker 0: game.".

649
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:15,440
Speaker 0: You know, like, if you ever watch, like, the Ten Commandments and, like, the Pharaohs just playing some weird game that doesn't look like any game you've ever seen, and it looks like an ancient, abstract kind of game, Tigris and Euphrates feels like an ancient game.

650
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:21,480
Speaker 0: Like, you could imagine yourself as some sort of ruler in Mesopotamia playing this sort of game.

651
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:34,340
Speaker 0: It's a very abstract game, and it introduces probably one of the biggest-- It's not un-abstract, because a lot of people argue about what it takes to be un-abstract game, but it is abstract.

652
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:37,520
Speaker 1: Yes, it is more abstract than a lot of other games.

653
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,139
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

654
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:44,720
Speaker 1: I mean, nominally, it's about empires, and I guess that still fits in with the theme.

655
00:44:45,141 --> 00:44:51,520
Speaker 1: But there's names for the colors and whatever, and all this fluff that has nothing to do with the game, and no one even pays attention to that.

656
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,573
Speaker 0: Yeah, we just say red, green, black, and blue.

657
00:44:53,815 --> 00:44:54,479
Speaker 0: That's what we say.

658
00:44:55,041 --> 00:44:59,560
Speaker 0: Not temples, farms, whatever, markets, I don't know.

659
00:45:00,302 --> 00:45:05,160
Speaker 1: And the moment you will-- Here's how you will know when you are ready to play Tigris and Euphrates.

660
00:45:06,782 --> 00:45:14,360
Speaker 1: The thing about Tigris and Euphrates that makes it interesting is that there are four different kinds of points, and you get them all in the course of the game.

661
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:19,399
Speaker 1: At the end of the game, the person who has the most-- The most least.

662
00:45:20,002 --> 00:45:21,460
Speaker 1: Of the least wins.

663
00:45:22,141 --> 00:45:23,580
Speaker 1: So if you-- There are four colors.

664
00:45:23,880 --> 00:45:26,508
Speaker 1: If I have 20 red, 30 blue, 100 green, and four black, my score is four.

665
00:45:31,404 --> 00:45:31,558
Speaker 0: Yep.

666
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:40,260
Speaker 1: If you think that that is some sort of amazing or crazily interesting game mechanic, and that excites you, you're ready to play Tigris and Euphrates.

667
00:45:40,822 --> 00:45:46,118
Speaker 1: If that just sounds like some arbitrary crap, you're not ready yet, and I don't-- I really mean that.

668
00:45:46,158 --> 00:45:46,900
Speaker 1: You're not ready yet.

669
00:45:47,481 --> 00:45:51,979
Speaker 0: Another game that I think is worth playing if you're sort of new to German games is St.

670
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:52,300
Speaker 0: Petersburg.

671
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:52,994
Speaker 0: Yes!

672
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:53,680
Speaker 0: St.

673
00:45:53,700 --> 00:46:09,940
Speaker 0: Petersburg teaches you a lot of things, even though it's a game that isn't too difficult to solve if you play it a lot, but it gives you-- Actually, more than anything, it will teach you the fun of getting into the theme of the German board game.

674
00:46:10,522 --> 00:46:10,762
Speaker 1: Yes.

675
00:46:10,923 --> 00:46:22,260
Speaker 1: It is a game where the symbols are abstract enough to where you will probably engage in the time-honored tradition of calling the mechanics or the components of a game by other names that are not in the instruction book.

676
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:34,440
Speaker 0: I mean, there's an example I heard on a podcast once where a guy was talking about how he went to a gaming con, and some guys were playing Settlers, but they were playing Settlers, and as they were playing, they just talked with Wild West accents.

677
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,167
Speaker 0: They'd be like, "Y'all got a brick?

678
00:46:37,292 --> 00:46:38,377
Speaker 0: I only got this here

679
00:46:38,417 --> 00:46:38,658
Speaker 0: wood.".

680
00:46:39,341 --> 00:46:49,460
Speaker 1: Now, that's interesting, because one thing that we did as a group, independently from any of these other groups, while we played, is we talked like cavemen, and it was Cavemen of Catan.

681
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:49,928
Speaker 0: Ooh, give brick.

682
00:46:49,948 --> 00:46:50,400
Speaker 0: Give brick for wood.

683
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:51,038
Speaker 1: Brick for wood.

684
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,196
Speaker 1: No, bee.

685
00:46:52,921 --> 00:46:53,659
Speaker 0: No, bee.

686
00:46:53,783 --> 00:46:54,076
Speaker 0: Powerful, bee.

687
00:46:54,422 --> 00:46:55,220
Speaker 1: Brain only.

688
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:55,604
Speaker 1: Ugh.

689
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:56,170
Speaker 1: Eat on the road.

690
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:57,928
Speaker 0: Robber, bee.

691
00:46:58,562 --> 00:46:58,604
Speaker 1: No.

692
00:46:59,300 --> 00:47:00,220
Speaker 1: Bribe, dude.

693
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:04,720
Speaker 0: Yes, so that is sort of-- It's like, you don't do that when you're playing Monopoly.

694
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,910
Speaker 0: When you play Monopoly, you're like, "I bought Mediterranean.

695
00:47:07,533 --> 00:47:08,759
Speaker 0: I got Boardwalk, bitches.

696
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:09,060
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

697
00:47:09,801 --> 00:47:10,343
Speaker 0: Hotels.".

698
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:14,060
Speaker 0: You don't really get into it in a weird and funny way.

699
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:22,380
Speaker 0: It's like, sure, a game is all strategy, and it's all about who's smarter and who makes better decisions as opposed to just random winner, and that's great.

700
00:47:22,940 --> 00:47:30,540
Speaker 0: But when you add on top of that the getting into it and being silly around the game, it's sort of like this double experience.

701
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:35,756
Speaker 0: Sort of like when you watch a movie that's serious and has a meaning, and at the end, you're like,

702
00:47:35,776 --> 00:47:35,816
Speaker 0: "Aw.".

703
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:43,400
Speaker 0: But during the game, they tell lots of jokes-- during the movie, you tell lots of jokes, and you laugh, and there's funny scenes and comic relief.

704
00:47:43,801 --> 00:47:46,860
Speaker 0: That's sort of what a German game is like if played properly.

705
00:47:47,060 --> 00:47:54,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you don't have to get into the theme of the game, because the theme of Carcassonne is not-- It's French guys building castles.

706
00:47:55,420 --> 00:48:01,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's not much to it, but you can get into the theme of your playing of the game.

707
00:48:01,781 --> 00:48:07,460
Speaker 1: Everyone just kind of gets into the game, the trash talking, the camaraderie, whatever it is your group of friends does while you're playing.

708
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:12,000
Speaker 1: That is almost more important than the games itself in terms of getting into board gaming.

709
00:48:12,500 --> 00:48:19,600
Speaker 1: Because that aspect in and of itself is highly entertaining, and it's a great way to get other people to play the games with you.

710
00:48:20,020 --> 00:48:24,640
Speaker 1: It's a great way to keep yourself interested before you've quite got the grasp of the mechanics.

711
00:48:25,460 --> 00:48:25,781
Speaker 0: And St.

712
00:48:25,802 --> 00:48:30,040
Speaker 0: Petersburg is the best opportunity to learn this skill, if you will.

713
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:34,019
Speaker 0: First of all, if you have a Russian accent, you scored big time.

714
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:38,160
Speaker 1: Yes, especially because you can say the names of all the buildings very funnily.

715
00:48:38,720 --> 00:48:40,073
Speaker 0: Like, "Oh, it's the

716
00:48:40,093 --> 00:48:40,618
Speaker 0: Peterhof!"

717
00:48:40,881 --> 00:48:42,050
Speaker 0: "Oh, Peterhof!

718
00:48:42,513 --> 00:48:43,057
Speaker 0: Peterhof!".

719
00:48:43,684 --> 00:48:44,760
Speaker 0: And Potjompkins Village.

720
00:48:45,902 --> 00:48:46,132
Speaker 1: Potjompkins!

721
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, Potjompkins.

722
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,520
Speaker 0: And there's a card for the workers, and the symbol for the workers is the chairs.

723
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:54,752
Speaker 0: You're like, "Oh, time for the

724
00:48:54,793 --> 00:48:55,177
Speaker 0: chairs!"

725
00:48:55,460 --> 00:48:58,000
Speaker 0: And you draw eight chairs, and you draw eight chair cards.

726
00:48:58,703 --> 00:49:03,140
Speaker 1: And we're not going to tell you about the rest of them, because we really want you to generate these things on your own.

727
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:07,319
Speaker 1: Plus, ours are a little offensive, but I think you'll come up with the same offensive ones.

728
00:49:07,862 --> 00:49:08,440
Speaker 0: It's not hard.

729
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:09,460
Speaker 1: It's not hard at all.

730
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:16,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot of games have these interesting things in them, and you end up just calling them by other names and talking in funny accents.

731
00:49:18,261 --> 00:49:24,100
Speaker 0: We play Amun-Re, which is a great game also, and in that game there's a pharaoh, right?

732
00:49:24,561 --> 00:49:32,040
Speaker 0: And in Puerto Rico, there's a governor, and both of those things in either game serve similar tasks, functions.

733
00:49:33,142 --> 00:49:37,300
Speaker 0: So when we play Amun-Re, we're always like, "Oh, governor," even though it's the pharaoh.

734
00:49:37,620 --> 00:49:37,760
Speaker 1: Yup.

735
00:49:38,081 --> 00:49:45,520
Speaker 1: Or in Puerto Rico, there's always at the end of any turn, it's doubloonim, because you put doubloons on anything that wasn't taken, so they're worth more the next time around.

736
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:48,280
Speaker 0: That's just something you do at the end of a turn in Puerto Rico, is you doubloonim.

737
00:49:48,580 --> 00:49:51,039
Speaker 1: So now, in our group, whenever we play a board game...

738
00:49:51,281 --> 00:49:53,917
Speaker 0: Like, we'll be playing Settlers, and at the end of a turn, we'll be like, "Oh,

739
00:49:53,937 --> 00:49:54,320
Speaker 0: doubloonim.".

740
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:55,500
Speaker 1: Doubloonim, pass the governor.

741
00:49:55,865 --> 00:49:56,018
Speaker 0: Yup.

742
00:49:56,260 --> 00:50:04,120
Speaker 1: And that might sound dumb, and it is dumb, but it's the schtick that has grown over the course of many years among the front row crew.

743
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:09,719
Speaker 1: And if you start playing German board games, you'll start to develop your own schticks, and they're going to be hilarious to you.

744
00:50:10,028 --> 00:50:10,094
Speaker 1: Yup.

745
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:12,560
Speaker 1: And that is so critical to enjoying these games.

746
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:18,660
Speaker 0: Pretty much every gaming group I know, every German board game who's really into it has some sort of schtick going on.

747
00:50:18,780 --> 00:50:19,899
Speaker 0: There's no one who doesn't have schticks.

748
00:50:20,060 --> 00:50:24,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, even the dead, serious, scary guy that you'll meet at the gaming convention who's sitting there brooding.

749
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:29,698
Speaker 1: And when he teaches you the game, he's kind of like a schoolmarm yelling at you, like, "And this is how you do

750
00:50:29,738 --> 00:50:29,859
Speaker 1: this!".

751
00:50:30,522 --> 00:50:33,999
Speaker 1: He'll make some joke in the middle of the game, and he'll get really into it.

752
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:34,674
Speaker 0: Yup.

753
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:45,360
Speaker 0: Now, here's a problem I know a lot of people have, is the only two things I think we have left to say in the show, is... How do you get the games, and how do you get players?

754
00:50:45,521 --> 00:50:50,520
Speaker 0: Because I know a lot of people out there aren't near a nerdy store, and a lot of people out there aren't near a convention.

755
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:58,819
Speaker 0: A lot of people out there have a hard- I see a lot of complaints, like, "I can't get people to play the games with me, I bought them, but no one will play with me, what do I

756
00:50:58,859 --> 00:50:58,999
Speaker 0: do?".

757
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,060
Speaker 1: Well, one, like we said before, Xbox Live, play Settlers there.

758
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:04,137
Speaker 0: Yup, that's a good one.

759
00:51:04,901 --> 00:51:08,240
Speaker 1: Two, if you think there isn't a gaming con near you, there is.

760
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:10,340
Speaker 0: There probably is, you should look for it.

761
00:51:10,380 --> 00:51:16,440
Speaker 1: There are very few places, at least in the United States, where there aren't gaming cons within a couple hours drive.

762
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:21,460
Speaker 0: Yup, the internet has the answer, don't come and say there's no gaming con near you unless you search for it.

763
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:28,040
Speaker 1: However, if you can prove that you live in an area where there are no gaming cons, I might just mail you a copy of Carcassonne.

764
00:51:29,385 --> 00:51:30,980
Speaker 1: Because I still have that extra copy.

765
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:39,180
Speaker 0: Also, there are many websites where you can play online, like there's a German site, Brett Spielwelt, but I don't use it because the interface is terrible.

766
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:47,440
Speaker 0: I recommend the website spielbyweb, S-P-I-E-L-B-Y-W-E-B, and you can play a few games and look at the rules of certain games there for free.

767
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:54,960
Speaker 0: And that's pretty cool, basically it's like emails you when it's your turn, you go to the website, you take your turn, then it emails you when it's your turn again.

768
00:51:55,240 --> 00:52:00,020
Speaker 1: In fact, I'd recommend a lot of you in the forum set something up and try playing games that way.

769
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:00,762
Speaker 0: That'd be cool.

770
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:04,711
Speaker 0: Lastly, if you have friends, just make them play.

771
00:52:04,751 --> 00:52:05,734
Speaker 0: What kind of losers are they?

772
00:52:05,854 --> 00:52:07,418
Speaker 0: They won't try something new.

773
00:52:07,478 --> 00:52:08,340
Speaker 0: What the hell's wrong?

774
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:14,700
Speaker 0: I can understand if someone plays some German games a few times, they don't like it, and then they're averse to playing anymore.

775
00:52:15,260 --> 00:52:21,780
Speaker 0: But someone who's never played one and is like "I don't want to play" and they just refuse to do it outright, what kind of person is that?

776
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,791
Speaker 0: Just refuse to try something new just because it's something new?

777
00:52:24,811 --> 00:52:26,096
Speaker 0: What the hell?

778
00:52:26,537 --> 00:52:27,260
Speaker 0: If you get new friends.

779
00:52:28,341 --> 00:52:44,500
Speaker 1: In terms of getting people to play, even if you've been playing all these advanced games at conventions, if you want to play with your friends who don't like or don't know about this gaming, just pick up Carcassonne or Settlers, even though you've played it a million times, even though you might know it's broken and you're going to win no matter what, and just play it with them.

780
00:52:44,940 --> 00:52:50,580
Speaker 1: Because the games are so easy to learn, especially Carcassonne, because the only complex part of Carcassonne is the scoring.

781
00:52:51,081 --> 00:52:54,590
Speaker 1: And you already know how to do it, so they don't need to know anything.

782
00:52:54,871 --> 00:52:58,460
Speaker 1: The only thing they need to know is how to get points and what to do on their turn.

783
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:00,004
Speaker 1: And you know what you do on your turn?

784
00:53:00,325 --> 00:53:04,300
Speaker 1: You draw a tile, you play a tile, you put a guy on a tile.

785
00:53:04,546 --> 00:53:04,878
Speaker 0: Or not.

786
00:53:05,161 --> 00:53:05,639
Speaker 1: Or not.

787
00:53:05,860 --> 00:53:06,938
Speaker 0: That's all you gotta do.

788
00:53:07,761 --> 00:53:10,900
Speaker 1: It's really easy to get someone to play the game, unless they're an idiot.

789
00:53:11,482 --> 00:53:16,820
Speaker 0: And also, if you're finding that people don't want to play a game, maybe the theme doesn't appeal to them.

790
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:20,611
Speaker 0: I mean, not everyone likes Ancient Italy or something like that.

791
00:53:20,992 --> 00:53:23,480
Speaker 0: You could go out and try to find a game that might appeal to them.

792
00:53:23,580 --> 00:53:28,600
Speaker 0: I know Ticket to Ride appeals to a lot of people, because it has lots of brightly colored trains and things.

793
00:53:29,762 --> 00:53:34,220
Speaker 0: You can find a game out there that possibly appeals to what that person likes.

794
00:53:35,763 --> 00:53:37,728
Speaker 1: I like how your example is brightly colored trains.

795
00:53:37,788 --> 00:53:43,159
Speaker 1: It's like, if your friend's an idiot, and you think you can plot him with shiny things...

796
00:53:43,500 --> 00:53:44,122
Speaker 0: Exactly!

797
00:53:44,904 --> 00:53:50,740
Speaker 0: There's a game, Niagara, that's actually an okay game, and it has a working waterfall in the game.

798
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:54,874
Speaker 0: And you move little boats up and down in these plastic tiles that slide off the waterfall.

799
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:56,660
Speaker 0: You can get anyone to play that game.

800
00:53:56,800 --> 00:54:00,126
Speaker 1: Or, it's kinda underhanded, but try to sell people.

801
00:54:00,206 --> 00:54:09,782
Speaker 1: If your friends are all bookish or nerdly, or in any way have some sort of competitive drive, which I know a lot of geeks do... Try to sell them.

802
00:54:09,862 --> 00:54:16,160
Speaker 1: on the fact that this is an intellectual competition, brain bashing against brain, the winner is smarter than the loser.

803
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:17,704
Speaker 1: Go ahead and exaggerate.

804
00:54:18,005 --> 00:54:21,820
Speaker 1: Convince them that this is more tactical than chess.

805
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:23,959
Speaker 0: Because in a lot of cases it is.

806
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:26,326
Speaker 1: Well, chess is a special case.

807
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:27,490
Speaker 1: We'll have to do a show about that.

808
00:54:27,550 --> 00:54:30,560
Speaker 1: Because I like chess, and I respect chess, but I don't enjoy chess.

809
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:31,700
Speaker 0: No, I don't enjoy it either.

810
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:36,260
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you're having trouble finding copies of the games, they're not hard to get.

811
00:54:36,420 --> 00:54:40,600
Speaker 0: There are two websites that you can just buy these games online and have them sent to you.

812
00:54:41,060 --> 00:54:47,000
Speaker 0: The ones that I know, that I trust, that I have purchased games from are funagain.com and gamefest.com.

813
00:54:47,602 --> 00:54:51,976
Speaker 0: So either one of those, whichever has the lower price, will sell you games.

814
00:54:52,378 --> 00:54:53,080
Speaker 0: They have all of them.

815
00:54:53,220 --> 00:54:58,920
Speaker 0: And BoardGameGeek has a database of all the games that is easily searchable, and they have a ranking of the top games.

816
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,640
Speaker 0: And there's comments and reviews and rules and everything for every game, and you possibly can't go wrong.

817
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:05,182
Speaker 1: Yes.

818
00:55:05,404 --> 00:55:07,580
Speaker 1: Now we didn't mention too many specific games in the show.

819
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:13,840
Speaker 1: And we'll probably post in the forums lists of early games, intermediate games, we'll post some sort of thing in the forums about this.

820
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:19,515
Speaker 1: Whenever you're in doubt about whether or not a game is good, one, just ask us in the forums.

821
00:55:19,615 --> 00:55:21,160
Speaker 1: We'll answer, we've probably played it.

822
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,160
Speaker 0: If we haven't played it, BoardGameGeek.

823
00:55:23,580 --> 00:55:23,821
Speaker 1: Yes.

824
00:55:24,142 --> 00:55:38,300
Speaker 1: Two, if we don't answer, or we're not available, just go to BoardGameGeek, the game will be listed, and everyone there in the forum will tell you if the game is good or not, or what's good about it, or you'll be able to figure out pretty much right away if it's up your alley or not.

825
00:55:38,460 --> 00:55:40,300
Speaker 1: BoardGameGeek has never steered us wrong.

826
00:55:40,802 --> 00:55:44,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, pretty much, you know, there's lots of ratings on games there.

827
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,120
Speaker 0: People, you know, rate a game from one to ten stars, and they tell you the current average or whatever.

828
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:56,980
Speaker 1: I also point out that the top lists on BoardGameGeek, like the top ten games, are pretty damn accurate in terms of what the top ten games are.

829
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,253
Speaker 0: Alright, let me go there and I'll tell you what's up there right now.

830
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:00,320
Speaker 0: Hold on, waiting for it to load.

831
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:06,840
Speaker 1: I mean, generally, some games stick up there forever, and some flash-in-the-pan games will pop up and then pop back down.

832
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:08,626
Speaker 0: Alright, so here's an idea for you.

833
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:08,866
Speaker 0: Ready?

834
00:56:09,288 --> 00:56:13,220
Speaker 0: Game number one is Puerto Rico, with a rating of 8.38.

835
00:56:13,220 --> 00:56:17,580
Speaker 0: So, if a game has a seven or an eight, that's actually pretty damn good.

836
00:56:17,960 --> 00:56:18,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about it.

837
00:56:18,703 --> 00:56:21,554
Speaker 1: Puerto Rico is still on top right now.

838
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:22,698
Speaker 1: When did that game come out?

839
00:56:22,819 --> 00:56:23,140
Speaker 0: God.

840
00:56:24,184 --> 00:56:25,089
Speaker 0: '99, I think.

841
00:56:25,149 --> 00:56:25,411
Speaker 0: I don't know.

842
00:56:25,652 --> 00:56:26,980
Speaker 0: Tigris and Euphrates is number two.

843
00:56:27,200 --> 00:56:30,580
Speaker 0: Power Grid, which I've never played, but I think I might get to, is number three.

844
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:32,980
Speaker 1: Is Power Grid similar to Web of Power?

845
00:56:33,981 --> 00:56:34,182
Speaker 0: No.

846
00:56:34,684 --> 00:56:49,240
Speaker 0: Calus is number four, El Grande is number five, Twilight Struggle is six, Battle Lore is seven, Princes of Florence is eight, Daimacher is nine, Age of Steam is ten, and Shogun, but not our Shogun, is eleven, Ra is twelve, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.

847
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:49,621
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

848
00:56:49,942 --> 00:56:50,162
Speaker 0: Yeah.

849
00:56:50,663 --> 00:56:57,620
Speaker 0: So, if you look at that list, those are a lot of pretty good games, and we own five of the top six.

850
00:56:58,021 --> 00:57:00,809
Speaker 1: Yeah.

851
00:57:00,829 --> 00:57:03,818
Speaker 0: We own seven of the top, six of the top seven, yeah.

852
00:57:05,120 --> 00:57:08,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, surprisingly, Battle Lore is up there, because Battle Lore is not that good of a game.

853
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,260
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is, a lot of the ratings have to do with fads and stuff.

854
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:12,940
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, Battle Lore is one of those that popped up.

855
00:57:12,940 --> 00:57:22,540
Speaker 0: Like, if a game is new and hot, it'll jump right up, because it'll have an average rating that's really high, but then over time, as more and more people play the game, it'll go down to where it belongs.

856
00:57:23,122 --> 00:57:32,000
Speaker 0: You know, so, it's actually, it's sort of hard to tell which games are all-time greats, and which games are new hotness from this list, unless you look at the years the game came out.

857
00:57:32,580 --> 00:57:35,820
Speaker 0: If a game is at the top of the list and came out this year, be very skeptical.

858
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:46,394
Speaker 1: Yes, because while I love Kalis, and Kalis is a great game, for the first two months after Kalis came out, as far as the internet was concerned, Kalis was Jesus Christ.

859
00:57:46,455 --> 00:57:47,800
Speaker 1: come back to kick your ass.

860
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,580
Speaker 0: And now it is probably where it belongs, down at number four.

861
00:57:50,841 --> 00:57:56,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, people talked about Kalis like it was the greatest thing ever printed on cardboard.

862
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,248
Speaker 1: People went crazy about it.

863
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:01,920
Speaker 1: It was, like, perfect ratings all over BoardGameGeek.

864
00:58:02,600 --> 00:58:05,317
Speaker 1: And then time went on and people were like, "Alright, it's not that

865
00:58:05,337 --> 00:58:05,599
Speaker 1: good.".

866
00:58:05,921 --> 00:58:07,192
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's good.

867
00:58:07,676 --> 00:58:08,100
Speaker 1: It's not that good.

868
00:58:08,120 --> 00:58:10,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't get us wrong, Kalis is in my top five.

869
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:11,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's not that good.

870
00:58:12,958 --> 00:58:13,220
Speaker 0: Alright.

871
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:20,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you can't tell, Scott's still pretty sick, and I'm, like, this is probably the last day of me being a little sick.

872
00:58:20,500 --> 00:58:23,659
Speaker 1: I've actually been having coughing fits, so I think we're done for the night.

873
00:58:25,181 --> 00:58:26,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, how badass are we?

874
00:58:26,731 --> 00:58:28,140
Speaker 1: We podcast even when we're sick.

875
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:29,005
Speaker 0: I do.

876
00:58:29,045 --> 00:58:30,379
Speaker 0: You wussed out last week.

877
00:58:30,521 --> 00:58:30,785
Speaker 0: Yeah.

878
00:58:30,907 --> 00:58:31,739
Speaker 0: When only you were sick.

879
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:38,098
Speaker 1: I point out that on 50% of those days, you were 50% at fault, thus giving me only 75% of the blame.

880
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:40,589
Speaker 0: That's fine by me.

881
00:58:40,891 --> 00:58:42,000
Speaker 0: Most blame person you.

882
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:43,308
Speaker 0: 75%?

883
00:58:43,308 --> 00:58:44,600
Speaker 1: That's a C. That's not bad.

884
00:58:45,781 --> 00:58:47,949
Speaker 0: It's opposite, so you really, it's 75% bad, so 25% good is an F.

885
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:52,768
Speaker 1: No, I got a C at copping out.

886
00:58:52,808 --> 00:58:53,432
Speaker 1: That's not bad.

887
00:58:53,452 --> 00:58:54,035
Speaker 1: That's average.

888
00:58:54,075 --> 00:58:55,000
Speaker 1: I'm an average cop-out.

889
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,509
