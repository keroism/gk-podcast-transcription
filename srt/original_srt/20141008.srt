1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,562
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday October 8th 2014.

2
00:00:12,562 --> 00:00:13,084
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,244 --> 00:00:16,574
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight anime.

4
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:18,540
Speaker 0: We never watched or reviewed.

5
00:00:20,181 --> 00:00:21,217
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:24,943 --> 00:00:26,268
Speaker 0: So for all my travels.

7
00:00:26,288 --> 00:00:43,860
Speaker 0: I was actually in Vegas over the weekend, and I'd never been to Vegas before okay, so by expectation of Vegas was basically based on How I'd seen it portrayed in the media and based on other people I noted gone there, which pretty much was exemplified by the old Vegas strip.

8
00:00:44,823 --> 00:00:54,877
Speaker 0: And the new Vegas strip is way different, and I have to say and I'm not going to review Las Vegas right here I was surprised at how enjoyable a trip to Vegas actually was.

9
00:00:55,499 --> 00:00:57,043
Speaker 0: yeah Have you been there?

10
00:00:57,444 --> 00:01:03,420
Speaker 1: no, so okay, but my betray my expectation was not based on incredibly old media.

11
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:20,580
Speaker 1: Everything's really fancy And really touristy, but there's you know tons of stuff to do all over the place not just gambling even though There is gambling everywhere, and you can just sort of you know have a good time if you spend money.

12
00:01:21,204 --> 00:01:22,494
Speaker 1: And there's lots of shows and foods.

13
00:01:23,401 --> 00:01:30,820
Speaker 0: And I would like in the new strip because what they've done is they basically like along the main drag You can't actually even get to the street.

14
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:40,600
Speaker 0: They sort of built up these like overpasses and pathways connecting everything So that you're basically like being on a giant cruise ship except just floating in the sand instead in the water.

15
00:01:41,022 --> 00:01:42,006
Speaker 0: Yeah, the cool thing though.

16
00:01:42,106 --> 00:01:42,849
Speaker 0: Is that the airport is?

17
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:54,908
Speaker 0: literally You could walk from the airport to most of the hotels But for the fact that you're not allowed to walk out of the airport as far as I can tell Remember, it's a desert right.

18
00:01:54,928 --> 00:01:58,680
Speaker 1: so they just put everything right up on top of each other because we're all you know.

19
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,030
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you say that not like there's any it's not like you know.

20
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:03,440
Speaker 1: say in New York where there's a geography issue.

21
00:02:04,084 --> 00:02:04,407
Speaker 0: Well it's got.

22
00:02:04,447 --> 00:02:11,794
Speaker 0: you say that but most Airports in desert cities other than Vegas are not literally downtown next to all the hotels.

23
00:02:12,114 --> 00:02:16,530
Speaker 1: most desert cities are not just tourist Destinations and nothing else.

24
00:02:17,313 --> 00:02:20,120
Speaker 0: yeah, there are apparently people who live there But was funny there are Emily.

25
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:27,249
Speaker 0: I went to her for a run in the morning And we're running going out, and we tried to get off the strip Just like run outside of like the crowd.

26
00:02:27,771 --> 00:02:29,960
Speaker 0: there was almost no way to get off the strip.

27
00:02:30,522 --> 00:02:35,360
Speaker 0: So we finally get off and then we ran and then there was no way back by her hotel to get back on the strip.

28
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,480
Speaker 0: We were like behind Las Vegas.

29
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:42,904
Speaker 0: It was like being in an alley next to an amusement park with no actual way to get into the amusement park Mm-hmm.

30
00:02:43,349 --> 00:02:46,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a super good time and I saw Penn and Teller.

31
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,780
Speaker 0: and the thing I can say about Penn tellers.

32
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:57,052
Speaker 0: they put on the same good old show that they've always done and all their lives, but They're in the Rio which is kind of like a little bit away from the strip.

33
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,065
Speaker 0: the Rio is a shithole Is it?

34
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,525
Speaker 1: I thought it was just a fancy casino Are you kidding?

35
00:03:03,565 --> 00:03:05,750
Speaker 0: No the Rio is like really.

36
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:07,815
Speaker 0: the Rio felt like Atlantic City.

37
00:03:08,517 --> 00:03:11,543
Speaker 0: the Rio was dark Smoky dank.

38
00:03:11,763 --> 00:03:15,134
Speaker 0: there are strippers dancing like out, and it was just really unclassy.

39
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:16,679
Speaker 0: the food over there was garbage.

40
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,266
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm it's interesting.

41
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:33,893
Speaker 0: so we and well you know Penn and Teller ended, and they were like oh we'll just take a cab back because it's a really long walk to get back to the strip and Pretty much everyone who came to see Penn and Teller Took a cab there and the line for cabs was like over a hundred people deep.

42
00:03:33,953 --> 00:03:34,715
Speaker 0: so we walked back.

43
00:03:35,277 --> 00:03:48,839
Speaker 0: so uh Bear that in mind if you're gonna go to Vegas you want to see Penn and Teller don't actually stay at the Rio cuz it's kind of a shithole Unless you like to sit in front of a penny slot smoking and then have some mediocre American bar and grill food.

44
00:03:50,681 --> 00:03:53,771
Speaker 0: All right, okay, all right captain enthusiasm.

45
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,239
Speaker 1: What's your thing about casino hotels?

46
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:03,373
Speaker 1: So in news important news important news at work right.

47
00:04:03,413 --> 00:04:11,631
Speaker 1: we were discussing a few weeks ago whether or not Saturday morning cartoons still existed and No one was quite sure.

48
00:04:11,652 --> 00:04:14,992
Speaker 0: cuz no one watches television I just read an article that said they don't exist anymore.

49
00:04:15,414 --> 00:04:18,970
Speaker 1: in fact that is my news Starting like a few days ago.

50
00:04:18,990 --> 00:04:23,745
Speaker 1: I guess the most recent Saturday They don't exist anymore.

51
00:04:24,026 --> 00:04:38,017
Speaker 1: the CW was the last broadcast network still having cartoons on Saturday morning which is pretty much just like I guess Yu-Gi-Oh and some other crap and They got rid of it and replaced it with some live-action educational garbage.

52
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:41,108
Speaker 1: That's all family type whatever.

53
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:45,411
Speaker 1: so that is the end of Saturday morning cartoons, however You know what I have a feeling.

54
00:04:45,452 --> 00:04:49,309
Speaker 0: if I were a kid today I would not watch Saturday morning cartoons on TV.

55
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:52,859
Speaker 0: I would watch Saturday morning YouTube cartoons sure.

56
00:04:52,879 --> 00:04:54,466
Speaker 1: well I mean you watch YouTube whenever you want.

57
00:04:54,486 --> 00:04:55,210
Speaker 1: That's part of the reason.

58
00:04:55,230 --> 00:04:57,540
Speaker 0: They're dead yeah, but I would get up in the morning Saturday.

59
00:04:58,027 --> 00:05:03,920
Speaker 1: Of course you know I mean I think it's a very good thing that you can watch cartoons not on Saturday morning.

60
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:06,496
Speaker 1: You just watch them whenever you want which is great.

61
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:09,695
Speaker 1: obviously There's no need to have force you to watch them on Saturday morning.

62
00:05:09,715 --> 00:05:13,700
Speaker 1: It's also great You don't have to watch them with horrible ads all Saturday morning.

63
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,445
Speaker 1: It's actually part of the reason they died.

64
00:05:15,505 --> 00:05:20,702
Speaker 1: is an FCC rule changed and limited the amount of kid ads you could put during kid Shows?

65
00:05:20,963 --> 00:05:24,540
Speaker 1: yeah, so it wasn't very profitable to have these Saturday morning cartoons anymore.

66
00:05:24,821 --> 00:05:33,931
Speaker 1: We don't regulate well how many ads super packs can put out there sure, but the one thing That's bothersome about the lat the death of Saturday morning cartoons.

67
00:05:33,991 --> 00:05:34,734
Speaker 1: Is that you know?

68
00:05:34,754 --> 00:05:35,737
Speaker 1: I guess this has been.

69
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:36,480
Speaker 1: this isn't new.

70
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:42,061
Speaker 1: This has been true for decades like since they've been dying which I guess is they're really only a big thing in the 60s 70s And 80s.

71
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:48,800
Speaker 1: in the 90s like NBC already quit you know and it was only like Fox and CW only the ones that held out.

72
00:05:48,961 --> 00:05:53,669
Speaker 0: No, it's interesting cuz even by the 90s I didn't really watch cart.

73
00:05:53,729 --> 00:06:03,120
Speaker 0: the only cartoons that watch on TV in the 90s were primetime Yep, Nickelodeon cartoon anyway, or or they were right after school Because it was some anime shirt tsunami?

74
00:06:03,628 --> 00:06:04,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

75
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:11,640
Speaker 1: But the thing when Saturday morning cartoons existed in the heyday 60s 70s 80s right you had CBS NBC Fox ABC.

76
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:22,650
Speaker 1: if four networks basically Creating every single week Each one of them had like at least six seven shows.

77
00:06:23,603 --> 00:06:29,586
Speaker 0: Remember guys there were not one, but two different Sonic the Hedgehog cartoons.

78
00:06:29,827 --> 00:06:32,293
Speaker 1: that was later, but so six seven shows.

79
00:06:32,313 --> 00:06:37,187
Speaker 1: I guess Fox didn't exist for until the 80s, but Six seven shows times three.

80
00:06:37,207 --> 00:06:42,184
Speaker 1: that's like 21 new episodes 20 minute episodes of cartoons Every week.

81
00:06:42,605 --> 00:06:48,362
Speaker 1: that was a lot of animation production quantity even if not all of it was quality Right.

82
00:06:48,844 --> 00:06:53,980
Speaker 1: so now there are some amazing animations being created all the time.

83
00:06:54,582 --> 00:07:13,080
Speaker 1: But you know even if you add up things that are on the edge, so you know ponies Adventure time if you push it all the way down to everything you can think of like the regular show Gravity Falls There are not 21 new episodes of cartoons in the United States.

84
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:18,016
Speaker 0: I would argue that the average quality per minute of animation is much higher.

85
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:20,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not saying True I mean he man.

86
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:23,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, he man.

87
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:27,920
Speaker 1: you are correct, but that is not to say that all Saturday morning cartoons were garbage either.

88
00:07:28,462 --> 00:07:30,528
Speaker 1: You know you a little Muppet baby going on in there.

89
00:07:30,548 --> 00:07:34,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, my baby is the one thing that you can't get legally.

90
00:07:34,442 --> 00:07:43,499
Speaker 1: yeah, pretty much any Looney Tunes or You know All kinds of good stuff x-men fox Ninja Turtles.

91
00:07:44,241 --> 00:07:46,890
Speaker 0: Well, you know what we need because it's interesting.

92
00:07:47,111 --> 00:07:49,077
Speaker 0: I see the like the cartoon.

93
00:07:49,117 --> 00:07:49,840
Speaker 0: I'm watching right now.

94
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,125
Speaker 0: That's new that we haven't really talked on.

95
00:07:51,146 --> 00:07:53,255
Speaker 0: the show is the amazing adventures of gumball and it's not.

96
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:54,340
Speaker 0: it's not like ponies like this.

97
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,900
Speaker 0: Is the show pretty much aimed at kids?

98
00:07:56,940 --> 00:08:02,680
Speaker 0: it's the kind of thing that you'd watch on a Saturday morning as a cartoon and What's interesting is that one?

99
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:04,999
Speaker 0: It's a lot more adult than you would expect.

100
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:07,407
Speaker 0: But I think that might just be a product.

101
00:08:07,427 --> 00:08:16,366
Speaker 0: the fact that the last time I watched Saturday morning cartoons as a thing They were the most possible blend you could have For various cultural reasons.

102
00:08:16,386 --> 00:08:22,185
Speaker 0: I mean remember even primetime The Simpsons was controversial When it aired.

103
00:08:22,366 --> 00:08:26,300
Speaker 1: I think the thing is anyone who was alive in the Saturday morning cartoon era, right?

104
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,384
Speaker 1: You didn't have Netflix.

105
00:08:27,424 --> 00:08:28,287
Speaker 1: He didn't have whatever.

106
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:31,400
Speaker 1: so there were certain cartoons that were syndicated.

107
00:08:31,481 --> 00:08:32,429
Speaker 1: Those are the ones that were on.

108
00:08:32,471 --> 00:08:33,360
Speaker 1: we got home from school.

109
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,428
Speaker 1: Yep, you could see them all the time.

110
00:08:35,467 --> 00:08:37,255
Speaker 1: Disney afternoon was every fucking day.

111
00:08:37,294 --> 00:08:38,339
Speaker 1: DuckTales, right?

112
00:08:38,922 --> 00:08:40,849
Speaker 1: You know Batman animated series.

113
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,600
Speaker 1: every day you can watch Batman the animated series no problem.

114
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,839
Speaker 0: Usually you'd see the same episode just because that's how it all right.

115
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:48,185
Speaker 1: It's like there were a lot of shows.

116
00:08:48,205 --> 00:08:49,912
Speaker 1: you would see these shows every day.

117
00:08:50,193 --> 00:08:54,612
Speaker 1: They were they were good Most a lot of them, but it wasn't a big deal.

118
00:08:54,632 --> 00:08:56,320
Speaker 1: a Saturday morning cartoon.

119
00:08:56,722 --> 00:09:10,867
Speaker 1: There would be a new episode of it on Saturday morning And it would not be aired at any other time ever and you wouldn't get to see that episode again For weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks and weeks because there would be new episodes And there wouldn't be a rerun.

120
00:09:10,887 --> 00:09:13,320
Speaker 1: and it was Saturday morning only in this one time.

121
00:09:13,662 --> 00:09:16,280
Speaker 1: It's the only time you could see it unless you recorded it with your VCR.

122
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,584
Speaker 1: and it's not like.

123
00:09:17,605 --> 00:09:21,699
Speaker 1: they sold Saturday morning cartoons on VHS tape that often and that was expensive.

124
00:09:21,719 --> 00:09:26,834
Speaker 1: and So it was like a big deal to watch a Saturday morning cartoon.

125
00:09:26,854 --> 00:09:30,830
Speaker 1: Yeah at that time Like I watched Fox x-men.

126
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,699
Speaker 1: I watched every single episode.

127
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:35,449
Speaker 1: Yeah up until I missed it at some point.

128
00:09:35,529 --> 00:09:37,336
Speaker 0: Well, I remember the day.

129
00:09:37,376 --> 00:09:38,520
Speaker 0: that was multiple years.

130
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,460
Speaker 1: I saw every single new episode times.

131
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:44,730
Speaker 0: I'd miss episodes because like oh we're going to Disney World or whatever like.

132
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:47,818
Speaker 0: I remember those weekends like ah, I miss the cartoons.

133
00:09:48,018 --> 00:09:57,260
Speaker 0: Yeah Though there's such a part of like pop culture consciousness Even though they haven't really existed like they used to for a long time like they're relatively short.

134
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:14,123
Speaker 1: I mean there was you know decades anyone who grew up in the 60s 70s 80s 30 years worth of people growing up also early 90s ish Alright, so 40 years of people growing up the impressionable young childhood minds were slammed with cartoons Every week.

135
00:10:14,163 --> 00:10:18,154
Speaker 1: at this certain time though honest that's gonna last in the rest of our lives.

136
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:27,479
Speaker 0: that memory the ads are my favorite part Because one thing about occasionally like I'll find old Saturday morning cartoons like someone has a VHS tape or something and there's ads on there.

137
00:10:28,122 --> 00:10:34,000
Speaker 0: Seeing those ads today is a wonderful experience, but they're on YouTube - yeah, most of them are yeah.

138
00:10:34,322 --> 00:10:36,760
Speaker 0: Anyway, so this is kind of breaking news.

139
00:10:36,881 --> 00:10:47,500
Speaker 0: I tried to find a few sources, but something I'm not gonna not gonna go too deep into this But there was an article that was an interview with a guy who was speaking at the New York Comic Con Matthew click Steen.

140
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,383
Speaker 1: I never heard of him.

141
00:10:48,483 --> 00:10:51,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, he wrote a book called slimed.

142
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:52,938
Speaker 1: Is it about Nickelodeon?

143
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:57,612
Speaker 0: Pete and Pete was all white people slimed blob.

144
00:10:57,692 --> 00:10:58,355
Speaker 0: He was an author.

145
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,017
Speaker 0: He wrote this book.

146
00:10:59,057 --> 00:10:59,740
Speaker 0: He was doing a panel.

147
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:16,240
Speaker 0: I didn't know or care about him or who he was but there's this interview with him and the interview starts out pretty normal and the guy's answering questions and Basically as the interview goes on he starts getting like more and more weird and racist.

148
00:11:17,023 --> 00:11:17,887
Speaker 0: You know, it's one of those things.

149
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:20,899
Speaker 1: people who are fucked up can't hide that fact that they're fucked up.

150
00:11:21,384 --> 00:11:24,928
Speaker 0: Like imagine you're talking to someone you're like hey I'm talking to Neal Adams at some point.

151
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:27,640
Speaker 1: if you talk to him long enough, you will learn about the expanding earth.

152
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,704
Speaker 1: Can't hold it in notice.

153
00:11:29,765 --> 00:11:31,229
Speaker 0: There is no subduction.

154
00:11:31,350 --> 00:11:31,591
Speaker 1: right.

155
00:11:31,671 --> 00:11:37,729
Speaker 1: if you talk to us long enough, you know what you're gonna hear about Game theory maybe yeah, it's gonna come out.

156
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:39,153
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about the gays.

157
00:11:39,193 --> 00:11:42,054
Speaker 0: heuristic Scott's gonna talk about dude, bro We got all right.

158
00:11:42,701 --> 00:11:46,420
Speaker 1: So you talk to someone long enough the thing that they're into is gonna come out.

159
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:49,120
Speaker 1: It's even if you don't guide the conversation in that direction.

160
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:59,212
Speaker 0: So this thing just like it like it starts out as one of those things where someone says a few words that your brain says That there's no way he means it the way I think he might.

161
00:11:59,292 --> 00:12:01,280
Speaker 1: might someone says something on the edge?

162
00:12:01,461 --> 00:12:08,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, it could be interpreted as you know a legitimate point But it could also be crazy races.

163
00:12:08,607 --> 00:12:12,236
Speaker 0: My favorite part about this isn't the guy going increasingly racist.

164
00:12:12,657 --> 00:12:20,819
Speaker 0: It's the interviewer Reacting to this and basically like Getting like starting to argue with him a little bit and just not really sure what to do.

165
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:24,792
Speaker 1: I would just be like wow, you were a crazy fucking racist.

166
00:12:25,414 --> 00:12:27,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, so realize I'll give you a quote.

167
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:28,579
Speaker 0: This is a quote with the guys.

168
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,245
Speaker 1: I'm going to let everyone know this.

169
00:12:30,265 --> 00:12:33,274
Speaker 1: this interview is gonna be posted everywhere and I'm your career will end.

170
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:33,936
Speaker 1: good day, sir.

171
00:12:33,957 --> 00:12:42,004
Speaker 0: I Well, what's interesting is it's kind of like those people who get interviewed by the Daily Show a bad day to you horrible person But like not a good day.

172
00:12:42,044 --> 00:12:46,599
Speaker 0: so the people being interviewed by the Daily Show not realize they're being made fun of.

173
00:12:47,762 --> 00:12:49,915
Speaker 1: Well, there was that one with the Native Americans.

174
00:12:50,237 --> 00:12:52,286
Speaker 0: Yeah That was beautiful.

175
00:12:52,326 --> 00:12:56,220
Speaker 0: That was that was that was Scott Tanner and let me drink your tears.

176
00:12:58,401 --> 00:12:58,702
Speaker 0: Quote.

177
00:12:58,923 --> 00:13:01,492
Speaker 0: I think it's worse when they shove diversity in there.

178
00:13:01,913 --> 00:13:03,960
Speaker 0: Sanjay and Craig is a really good example.

179
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:11,200
Speaker 0: That's a show by the way Has an Indian kid in it and a snake and stuff Which funnily enough is written in part by Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi from Pete & Pete.

180
00:13:11,642 --> 00:13:18,992
Speaker 0: That show is awkward because and I'm quoting exactly here There's actually no reason for that character to be Indian.

181
00:13:19,654 --> 00:13:21,680
Speaker 1: What reason is there for them to not be Indian?

182
00:13:22,924 --> 00:13:24,739
Speaker 1: There's no reason for Pete & Pete to be white.

183
00:13:26,321 --> 00:13:29,509
Speaker 0: Yes, that is an entire article.

184
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,120
Speaker 0: the entire interview just from that moment goes downhill.

185
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:41,920
Speaker 0: So the news is that the New York Comic Con as far as I can tell this just happened like a few minutes ago.

186
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,743
Speaker 0: So I'm going on.

187
00:13:43,205 --> 00:13:44,108
Speaker 0: I found a few sources.

188
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:45,655
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure this happened.

189
00:13:45,675 --> 00:13:50,294
Speaker 0: New York Comic Con was like Yeah, your Nick nostalgia night panel is canceled.

190
00:13:50,817 --> 00:13:54,165
Speaker 1: Okay, so Things move quickly.

191
00:13:54,185 --> 00:13:57,560
Speaker 1: is this guy from a particular company or is he just on his own with this book?

192
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,953
Speaker 0: He wrote not sure I gotta do more research on him, but he wrote the book.

193
00:14:01,334 --> 00:14:02,800
Speaker 1: I would a take his badge away.

194
00:14:03,322 --> 00:14:05,289
Speaker 1: Right, I mean people would be like freedom of speech.

195
00:14:05,370 --> 00:14:08,000
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, you can say whatever he wants, but he's not coming.

196
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:08,703
Speaker 0: This is my house.

197
00:14:08,743 --> 00:14:10,330
Speaker 1: This is a private convention.

198
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:12,800
Speaker 1: We can deny anyone entry for any reason.

199
00:14:13,001 --> 00:14:13,764
Speaker 0: I feel like guys.

200
00:14:13,945 --> 00:14:15,552
Speaker 0: Keith Apicary can't come to PAX.

201
00:14:15,793 --> 00:14:17,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, just how it goes, right?

202
00:14:17,902 --> 00:14:25,180
Speaker 1: So yeah, we if you find out that you're racist We're just gonna you know deny you entry because we can and we want to because we don't like racism.

203
00:14:25,441 --> 00:14:32,800
Speaker 1: Oh, and by the way, if I was also in charge of New York Comic Con I would figure out whatever company he works for and whatever friends he has and deny them entry too.

204
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,996
Speaker 1: I'd be like your whole company can't come booth taken away.

205
00:14:35,016 --> 00:14:37,704
Speaker 1: No refund Just to really dry.

206
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,214
Speaker 1: even if he was like working for Marvel drawing a comic.

207
00:14:40,234 --> 00:14:40,996
Speaker 1: I'd be like Marvel.

208
00:14:41,016 --> 00:14:41,579
Speaker 1: you can't come.

209
00:14:41,599 --> 00:14:43,062
Speaker 1: I Would do that.

210
00:14:43,082 --> 00:14:46,335
Speaker 1: I would go that big just to be like boom take that.

211
00:14:46,878 --> 00:14:47,279
Speaker 1: what now?

212
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,820
Speaker 1: Maybe you shouldn't hire racist people and then every company would start checking every employee.

213
00:14:54,102 --> 00:14:54,814
Speaker 1: It'd be great.

214
00:14:56,201 --> 00:14:56,603
Speaker 0: Do you get a?

215
00:14:56,904 --> 00:15:01,840
Speaker 0: Dora the Explorer was certainly something of a success, but there's no reason for Sanjay to be Indian at all.

216
00:15:02,121 --> 00:15:03,647
Speaker 0: No one working in that shows Indian.

217
00:15:03,867 --> 00:15:04,530
Speaker 0: They're all white.

218
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,614
Speaker 0: It's all white people.

219
00:15:05,634 --> 00:15:08,084
Speaker 0: blah blah blah and The.

220
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:08,526
Speaker 0: it's like.

221
00:15:08,546 --> 00:15:09,369
Speaker 0: that's the moment.

222
00:15:09,410 --> 00:15:11,640
Speaker 1: people should only make things with white people in them.

223
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:14,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then he starts accusing it of being blackface.

224
00:15:15,135 --> 00:15:20,340
Speaker 0: and then at one point the interviewer Let me find this moment is this Sanjay actor not an Indian person?

225
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,229
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm trying to find the moment where the.

226
00:15:22,309 --> 00:15:23,999
Speaker 1: is it a person pretending to be Indian?

227
00:15:25,402 --> 00:15:26,949
Speaker 0: So here's what the interviewer says.

228
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:33,720
Speaker 1: after this guy goes crazy for a while Why does he stand there and let him do this just like keep embarrassing yourself.

229
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:38,280
Speaker 1: Let's get more crazy video content cuz he's gonna get mad hits of people wanting to see how horrible you are.

230
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,230
Speaker 0: There's a lot of issue other issues going on when you're working.

231
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,638
Speaker 0: the people just I wouldn't want to see.

232
00:15:41,718 --> 00:15:42,944
Speaker 0: I you know I do it.

233
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:44,331
Speaker 0: why do it at all if you're gonna do it.

234
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,020
Speaker 0: Hey, look, there's our Indian guy.

235
00:15:46,142 --> 00:15:46,679
Speaker 0: We're doing it too.

236
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:51,619
Speaker 0: We got Indian guys blah blah blah and then he's doing this rant and then the interviewer asked this question doesn't even ask the question.

237
00:15:52,441 --> 00:15:54,475
Speaker 1: Let's see this interview is better than what here's.

238
00:15:54,515 --> 00:15:58,232
Speaker 0: the interviewer Sanjay is voiced by an Indian American actor.

239
00:15:58,553 --> 00:15:59,156
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a cartoon.

240
00:15:59,216 --> 00:15:59,417
Speaker 1: Okay.

241
00:15:59,538 --> 00:16:08,120
Speaker 0: Yes He just jumps right in there and The guy at one point says, uh, well, here's the great quote.

242
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:14,040
Speaker 0: I would be offended if one of the friends on Clifford the Big Red Dog had a friend who was in a wheelchair.

243
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:25,993
Speaker 0: Why I understand the idea of there's someone like me But it's necessary that the show is actually saying something Doing something with the disability if you just throw that character in there.

244
00:16:26,174 --> 00:16:28,320
Speaker 0: Oh the friend just happens to be black.

245
00:16:28,803 --> 00:16:31,099
Speaker 0: I feel that I'm being that it's being used.

246
00:16:32,441 --> 00:16:47,360
Speaker 1: you know people just happen to be all kinds of things and they just live their lives and The thing that they are or happen to be doesn't really come up Or at least it shouldn't except for when there's people like you Time that it matters.

247
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:50,509
Speaker 0: This guy's a lot like those gamergate kids in the sense that they like.

248
00:16:50,549 --> 00:16:57,560
Speaker 0: they'll say things that assume some very Very important things that are demonstrably false.

249
00:16:58,182 --> 00:17:05,647
Speaker 0: Like you make a big assumption like the biggest possible assumption that you are in the year 1951. yep, that's like.

250
00:17:05,688 --> 00:17:11,711
Speaker 0: that's a big assumption because that's not true Basically, well, I mean white is the default.

251
00:17:11,951 --> 00:17:14,239
Speaker 1: I assume that the person interviewing me is a member of the KKK.

252
00:17:15,842 --> 00:17:16,771
Speaker 1: That's a good assumption.

253
00:17:16,813 --> 00:17:22,492
Speaker 1: to go on And I assume that anyone reading the media that they're creating is also a member.

254
00:17:22,512 --> 00:17:24,579
Speaker 0: so I got two sources on this.

255
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:28,853
Speaker 0: So if I'd ends up that it was not cancelled I retracted.

256
00:17:28,893 --> 00:17:30,317
Speaker 0: but for now good job.

257
00:17:30,357 --> 00:17:31,119
Speaker 0: New York Comic Con.

258
00:17:31,641 --> 00:17:41,872
Speaker 1: Yep, now the thing is would they have the balls to do it if say, you know some big-name hotshot movie industry person Who was like guest of honor did something like this.

259
00:17:42,032 --> 00:17:42,775
Speaker 1: that I don't know.

260
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:43,920
Speaker 1: would they have the balls?

261
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:47,029
Speaker 0: You know, I am confident that Paxwood.

262
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,580
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm confident that Robert Coo would kick his own keynote out.

263
00:17:50,962 --> 00:17:53,117
Speaker 1: I'm confident Robert Coo would kick his own ass out.

264
00:17:56,551 --> 00:18:05,510
Speaker 0: But yeah anyway things of the day.

265
00:18:05,570 --> 00:18:06,575
Speaker 0: It's not a video.

266
00:18:06,816 --> 00:18:09,528
Speaker 0: if you want to see a video instead of my thing of the day go to College Humor.

267
00:18:09,549 --> 00:18:10,111
Speaker 0: click on Something.

268
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:10,632
Speaker 0: they're all funny.

269
00:18:11,434 --> 00:18:17,250
Speaker 0: So this is a quote from the anime news network forum from masa juice.

270
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,610
Speaker 1: What why is your thing of the day a quote?

271
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:22,934
Speaker 0: Because it's so.

272
00:18:23,015 --> 00:18:23,677
Speaker 0: why did you?

273
00:18:23,697 --> 00:18:26,950
Speaker 1: why did you dive into the one of the bowels of the internet to find anything?

274
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,620
Speaker 0: Oh, I did not dive in to find this.

275
00:18:28,821 --> 00:18:32,705
Speaker 0: colony drop posted it So I just got to enjoy it without having to go in there All right.

276
00:18:32,890 --> 00:18:38,574
Speaker 0: So it's like when someone else goes swimming in the poop field and comes back with a diamond and you can look at the diamond Without swimming in the poop.

277
00:18:39,116 --> 00:18:42,270
Speaker 0: So like Zach Vershey, for example, my hat is off to you.

278
00:18:42,390 --> 00:18:45,946
Speaker 0: You swim in a sea of effervescent poop for my amusement.

279
00:18:46,066 --> 00:18:46,890
Speaker 1: All right quotes.

280
00:18:47,710 --> 00:19:04,270
Speaker 0: I think that anime news network should stop making preview guides because reviewers only right there spelled wrong on opinion and most of the time they make all anime look like a waste as in my waste of time and mizzled potential viewers misled.

281
00:19:05,231 --> 00:19:12,734
Speaker 0: So for all so called reviewers, I could go say go fudge yourself and then burn together with yours opinions Okay.

282
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:15,088
Speaker 1: So first of all, most anime is a waste of time and garbage.

283
00:19:15,129 --> 00:19:17,456
Speaker 1: Yes So those are accurate guide.

284
00:19:17,636 --> 00:19:22,429
Speaker 1: Also, let me give you a review now of an anime that has no opinion.

285
00:19:22,449 --> 00:19:24,617
Speaker 1: Scott No opinion in this anime review.

286
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:24,938
Speaker 1: You ready?

287
00:19:24,958 --> 00:19:25,600
Speaker 1: Gotta be objective.

288
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:27,326
Speaker 1: All right, so the anime is gonna be.

289
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:28,550
Speaker 1: let's look on the shelf.

290
00:19:29,792 --> 00:19:31,506
Speaker 1: What's on the shelf there over there?

291
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:34,315
Speaker 0: The big boy golden boy.

292
00:19:34,335 --> 00:19:36,021
Speaker 1: All right, here's a review of golden boy.

293
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:38,470
Speaker 1: That is no opinion in it whatsoever.

294
00:19:38,931 --> 00:19:40,335
Speaker 1: Golden boy is an anime.

295
00:19:40,777 --> 00:19:41,318
Speaker 1: It was made.

296
00:19:41,419 --> 00:19:43,003
Speaker 1: I don't know the exact year 90s ish.

297
00:19:43,084 --> 00:19:45,250
Speaker 1: I'm guessing I would say the exact year.

298
00:19:45,331 --> 00:19:52,890
Speaker 0: But by looking at in retrospect I should have Randomly said the name of an anime that we both Remember more something that we know more information about without having to look it up.

299
00:19:53,271 --> 00:19:56,123
Speaker 1: It has X number of episodes sailor moon sailor moon.

300
00:19:56,183 --> 00:19:57,930
Speaker 0: sailor moon is 200 episodes long.

301
00:19:57,990 --> 00:20:02,470
Speaker 0: It's based on a manga about magical girls, but it is significantly different from the manga in many ways.

302
00:20:02,853 --> 00:20:03,901
Speaker 0: It was drawn on cells.

303
00:20:04,385 --> 00:20:12,816
Speaker 1: in the story There are girls who are visited by cats given magical powers and they have to fight against dark forces to save the world From destruction, wait, wait, wait, don't it?

304
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:16,969
Speaker 0: You know, they're not necessarily all dark forces forces of Queen Beryl and others.

305
00:20:17,915 --> 00:20:19,043
Speaker 0: That is technically true.

306
00:20:19,063 --> 00:20:19,264
Speaker 0: Okay.

307
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:23,381
Speaker 1: Yes, okay There are transformation sequences in it.

308
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,149
Speaker 1: It is a magical girl show.

309
00:20:26,275 --> 00:20:28,775
Speaker 1: They used color Episode.

310
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:36,410
Speaker 0: color episodes are 20-something minutes Delved in English by deke on crunchyroll right now.

311
00:20:38,762 --> 00:20:40,214
Speaker 1: Pretty little crystals on crunchyroll right now.

312
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:44,064
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the other and Yeah, that's about it.

313
00:20:44,386 --> 00:20:45,008
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.

314
00:20:45,028 --> 00:20:46,795
Speaker 1: That is an objective review.

315
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:47,839
Speaker 1: Just the spec sheet.

316
00:20:48,483 --> 00:20:56,491
Speaker 1: This is if I say anything such as awesome transformation sequences or Suddenly that's opinion.

317
00:20:56,511 --> 00:21:07,787
Speaker 0: So The reason I make this my thing of the day is that in the anime fandom this sentiment is So prevalent and so calm.

318
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:12,100
Speaker 1: you should make the no opinion review site and then of everything and see what people say.

319
00:21:13,521 --> 00:21:19,699
Speaker 0: Well, there used to be those old reviews that were mostly reviewed like the encoding quality and whether like no that was okay.

320
00:21:20,101 --> 00:21:23,480
Speaker 1: So that was specifically anime on DVD which no longer exists.

321
00:21:24,363 --> 00:21:24,644
Speaker 1: I don't know.

322
00:21:24,664 --> 00:21:31,590
Speaker 1: people remember how good anime on DVD was actually really useful because it had the list of like animes coming out that When there was no sheet and whatever.

323
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:37,334
Speaker 1: but it's reviews were right They would basically reviewing the quality of the DVD and such.

324
00:21:37,414 --> 00:21:41,486
Speaker 1: because up until that point You animates on VHS.

325
00:21:41,526 --> 00:21:43,292
Speaker 1: It'd be like oh, this is like a third generation.

326
00:21:43,313 --> 00:21:45,944
Speaker 1: You're looking at a really shitty version of this Right.

327
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:48,200
Speaker 1: So the actual quality of the anime was a big deal.

328
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,020
Speaker 1: It's like oh my god, you can actually see the show without a whole bunch of noise and grain.

329
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:54,530
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah guys, you realize we watched the end of utenna.

330
00:21:54,611 --> 00:21:56,217
Speaker 1: subtitles are readable and accurate.

331
00:21:56,258 --> 00:21:56,860
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

332
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,586
Speaker 0: We watch VHS of the stereo.

333
00:21:58,727 --> 00:22:09,219
Speaker 0: sound is actually like properly mixed and it's not some mono down mix Episode like like like the second to less of 37 or so of utenna like the episodes in that point to the end.

334
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,740
Speaker 0: Trackings we had sort of in tracking problems.

335
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:14,487
Speaker 0: If you don't know what I mean You're way younger than us right.

336
00:22:14,668 --> 00:22:20,076
Speaker 0: and then we go to adjust the tracking and it turned out the tracking was burned in From the previous generation copy.

337
00:22:20,136 --> 00:22:25,340
Speaker 1: Yep So now that no one gives a fuck about those kinds of issues anymore anime on DVD doesn't need to exist.

338
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:32,696
Speaker 1: But and it's time that was actually not a bad thing to you know At least get the information about the technology and the.

339
00:22:32,837 --> 00:22:36,868
Speaker 1: you know The quality the physical quality of the media.

340
00:22:36,949 --> 00:22:41,440
Speaker 0: So the reason this guy posted he has one more sentence about Trinity seven.

341
00:22:41,722 --> 00:22:42,125
Speaker 0: This is why.

342
00:22:42,165 --> 00:22:43,837
Speaker 1: what is Trinity seven anime?

343
00:22:44,099 --> 00:22:48,499
Speaker 0: Okay I found it entertaining and fun and MC is not a wimp and that's one reason because I like it.

344
00:22:48,961 --> 00:22:56,620
Speaker 0: so basically he was mad that someone else had a different opinion he had about Trinity seven and Here's where this is beautiful.

345
00:22:57,081 --> 00:23:04,384
Speaker 0: He joined the anime news network forum on the 12th of March 2010 and has posted three times All of them about Trinity.

346
00:23:04,424 --> 00:23:06,030
Speaker 0: this was his third post.

347
00:23:06,091 --> 00:23:20,429
Speaker 0: So he was angry enough About someone having an opinion about an anime to make his third ever post in more than four years On the anime news network forum.

348
00:23:21,151 --> 00:23:26,272
Speaker 0: I don't know what it is about anime fandom, but the whole How is that anything from any fandom?

349
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:27,900
Speaker 0: I don't see this specific.

350
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,546
Speaker 0: Don't review things.

351
00:23:31,148 --> 00:23:32,853
Speaker 1: No, you don't see that in video game fandom ever.

352
00:23:32,874 --> 00:23:34,740
Speaker 0: I do but not nearly as prevalent.

353
00:23:34,861 --> 00:23:41,184
Speaker 1: You don't see it tweeted in your feed because you're not following those people and Also that those other phantoms.

354
00:23:41,204 --> 00:23:46,460
Speaker 1: don't have the kinds of personalities in them that are trolling forums looking for hilarity and retweeting it.

355
00:23:46,805 --> 00:23:49,127
Speaker 0: That may be true But it's there.

356
00:23:49,147 --> 00:23:51,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I feel like it's more common in anime.

357
00:23:53,082 --> 00:23:54,407
Speaker 1: No, it's in every fandom kind of like.

358
00:23:54,427 --> 00:24:00,780
Speaker 0: how like look at look at the anti-professionals and that other side thing in anime Like don't see that nearly as much at gaming cons?

359
00:24:00,860 --> 00:24:03,207
Speaker 0: Yeah, you do not not as much.

360
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:06,056
Speaker 1: I positive people like all indie gaming gray all this.

361
00:24:06,477 --> 00:24:09,086
Speaker 1: your game is too Well, you know overproduced.

362
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:10,089
Speaker 1: you're your people type board.

363
00:24:10,109 --> 00:24:13,240
Speaker 1: I've seen board game people make threads about games, which games are overproduced.

364
00:24:14,221 --> 00:24:14,583
Speaker 1: Like st.

365
00:24:14,623 --> 00:24:15,627
Speaker 1: Petersburg is overproduced.

366
00:24:15,647 --> 00:24:16,430
Speaker 1: doesn't need that board.

367
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:21,306
Speaker 1: Let's go, you know wooden pieces really for serious It's a card game.

392
00:25:57,640 --> 00:25:57,700
Speaker 0: All

393
00:25:57,861 --> 00:26:08,647
Speaker 1: right other meta moments tonight on the crappy and soon-to-be-dead David Letterman show is The exact opposite of crappy and soon-to-be-dead Hatsune Miku,

394
00:26:08,889 --> 00:26:09,130
Speaker 0: yep,

395
00:26:09,412 --> 00:26:21,333
Speaker 1: it is the clash of worlds The new replacing the old the newest possible amazing thing You know being ushered out guide the deadest oldest tree.

396
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:34,647
Speaker 0: you realize that Something like Hatsune Miku will one day replace The hosts of a late show and then will be the host of that late show for the rest of human history As long as people care.

397
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:44,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but at the same time The marginal cost of making that late show Drop close to zero to where you could just keep making it for free as long as there's electricity.

398
00:26:44,824 --> 00:26:48,814
Speaker 1: I just think it's gonna be awesome to have the 20th century and the 21st century.

399
00:26:49,861 --> 00:26:51,245
Speaker 1: Basically the 20th century is.

Speaker 0: No, no, you don't.

410
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:13,278
Speaker 0: So, uh, we were you know, we were trying to come up with a show to do.

411
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:16,010
Speaker 0: well You know Wednesday show and it's all rims idea.

412
00:27:16,793 --> 00:27:17,636
Speaker 0: Well, did you have an idea?

413
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:18,540
Speaker 0: No, okay.

414
00:27:19,521 --> 00:27:23,400
Speaker 0: So we realized, you know, we've been doing geek nights for almost a decade.

415
00:27:23,862 --> 00:27:26,250
Speaker 0: We've got a lot of fucking episodes out there.

416
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,711
Speaker 0: I think we have.

417
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:29,260
Speaker 1: it's about to be the ninth year nine years.

418
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,928
Speaker 1: We started in October 05 and it's October 14.

419
00:27:31,928 --> 00:27:33,051
Speaker 1: So that's 14 minus 5 is 9.

420
00:27:33,051 --> 00:27:33,613
Speaker 1: I mean guys in.

421
00:27:38,421 --> 00:27:46,143
Speaker 0: We won the first and I think only I don't know how long they kept doing it parsec award for best anime Podcasts great.

422
00:27:46,504 --> 00:27:56,177
Speaker 0: That's and I think we've actually done more anime podcasts than anime world order despite the fact that they do way better Anime, but I think one of their anime podcast counts are like 30 hours.

423
00:27:57,061 --> 00:28:01,280
Speaker 0: But what we did is, you know, we had seen all fuck ton of anime.

424
00:28:01,421 --> 00:28:02,668
Speaker 0: I mean between Scott and I.

425
00:28:03,191 --> 00:28:11,202
Speaker 1: we like there were a while ago like Obviously, I haven't seen all the anime ever but I have seen more anime than most people put together in like 2004.

426
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:13,382
Speaker 0: ish I remember this.

427
00:28:13,763 --> 00:28:20,344
Speaker 0: a like here are the top 100 like pretty much most important or notable anime ever I'd seen like 90 plus.

428
00:28:20,364 --> 00:28:25,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've seen basically all of them and the few we hadn't seen we knew a lot about.

429
00:28:26,324 --> 00:28:28,174
Speaker 0: So we'd seen a lot of anime.

430
00:28:28,194 --> 00:28:35,876
Speaker 0: So when we started doing geek nights Wednesday was literally the easiest night because we were just all the anime we had already seen.

431
00:28:35,936 --> 00:28:37,200
Speaker 1: we could easily just talk about.

432
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,813
Speaker 0: Hey Scott, what should we review tonight?

433
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:39,579
Speaker 0: Evangelion?

434
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,246
Speaker 0: I could talk about that for an hour.

435
00:28:41,346 --> 00:28:43,900
Speaker 1: Let's go down the checklist of this, you know hundred important anime.

436
00:28:44,381 --> 00:28:45,906
Speaker 0: Let's do cowboy bebop.

437
00:28:45,926 --> 00:28:47,311
Speaker 0: That one will be even easier.

438
00:28:47,632 --> 00:28:49,619
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've never talked about that.

439
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:52,108
Speaker 1: on the show We've only done like 10 episodes of geek night kind of

440
00:28:52,128 --> 00:29:12,896
Speaker 0: like how when I got to RIT as an anime fan and that First meeting when I went up to the anime club library and I was told I could check out up to three VHS tapes and then I saw the like 600 tapes up there and I had never heard of 90% of those anime I gorged on anime until my eyes fell out.

441
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:13,720
Speaker 0: It was amazing.

442
00:29:14,202 --> 00:29:17,336
Speaker 0: But eventually I'd seen everything that was notable from the past.

443
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:28,942
Speaker 0: Yep, and As a result, I realize now, you know, we're scrambling We had to slow down our rate of anime reviews just because we have to actually finish an entire show to do a good review Of it.

444
00:29:29,023 --> 00:29:30,071
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can't I haven't.

445
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:31,280
Speaker 0: we both have to watch it.

446
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:31,713
Speaker 1: I have you.

447
00:29:31,795 --> 00:29:40,440
Speaker 1: yeah We both have to watch a whole anime That we had to order to do a show on it because every show we've already both seen has already had a show done

448
00:29:40,841 --> 00:29:45,620
Speaker 0: Yep, and some of these shows are long like yeah, we could do a show on fushigi yugi Scott hasn't watched all that shit.

449
00:29:45,842 --> 00:29:46,834
Speaker 1: I haven't watched any of that.

450
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:57,279
Speaker 0: Yeah So I was starting to think and then I realized there's a few anime that are pretty big That for whatever reason like I just never watched or even we both just never watched it.

451
00:29:57,881 --> 00:30:07,920
Speaker 1: So the ones that didn't make that top 100 list like that the ones from like 100 to 200 Yeah, or the one it's you a lot of them were ones that were big at a time, but aren't big overall.

452
00:30:09,441 --> 00:30:20,800
Speaker 0: So I think the example I got here the biggest one and this is kind of a wing in here because we're trying to figure Like what shows can we review that we haven't done already that we actually want to watch again?

453
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:26,960
Speaker 0: Oh, because that's another problem because for example, we hadn't seen my old sky time in a long time.

454
00:30:27,402 --> 00:30:29,594
Speaker 0: So we watched it again because that show is delightful.

455
00:30:29,835 --> 00:30:30,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, we reviewed it.

456
00:30:31,443 --> 00:30:39,636
Speaker 0: I don't really want to watch cause they know you Jimbo again I tried to watch it twice didn't finish it either time do an episode on it at all.

457
00:30:39,877 --> 00:30:40,499
Speaker 0: I don't know.

458
00:30:41,201 --> 00:30:50,140
Speaker 1: So we started watching the show at RIT and then we gradually tried to watch it again on Netflix and like o5 Or we made it like eight episodes in right?

459
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:55,480
Speaker 1: We were getting the DVDs from Netflix and I think those were like that's when we stopped watching the Netflix TV.

460
00:30:55,601 --> 00:31:04,309
Speaker 1: We basically had a routine before watch a Netflix DVD every single night and then This is before they had the streaming and whatnot.

461
00:31:04,349 --> 00:31:07,300
Speaker 0: It was also before we'd really did geek night some of that, right?

462
00:31:07,621 --> 00:31:13,440
Speaker 1: We were watching South Park DVDs every night whatever and then just we caused a new Jimbo.

463
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,344
Speaker 1: so it was like we.

464
00:31:14,464 --> 00:31:21,840
Speaker 1: that's when we stopped watching Netflix every night and It just like there was no urge to see the next episode.

465
00:31:22,221 --> 00:31:30,519
Speaker 0: So later like in the moment that crystallized this in my brain was I was on Metro North later And I thought I'm gonna finish the show so I can at least talk about it.

466
00:31:31,042 --> 00:31:35,900
Speaker 0: And I made it to about the same point like a few episodes past where we'd stopped and then the episode ended.

467
00:31:36,346 --> 00:31:37,239
Speaker 0: I'm sitting there on the train.

468
00:31:37,461 --> 00:31:46,549
Speaker 0: I got about 40 minutes before I'm getting off the train and I just didn't want to watch the next episode and Instead I watched episode 1 of Evangelion

469
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:49,740
Speaker 1: and then immediately as soon as it was over the train was pulling in the station I

470
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,708
Speaker 0: was like no fuck fuck and I went.

471
00:31:51,728 --> 00:31:54,417
Speaker 0: I got into the house and then I watched episode 2 of Evangelion.

472
00:31:54,437 --> 00:31:54,939
Speaker 1: There you go.

473
00:31:56,161 --> 00:32:00,134
Speaker 0: So yeah, cause I know your Jimbo was just really lame and there's it didn't.

474
00:32:00,214 --> 00:32:06,780
Speaker 1: I'm sure that show had good parts Especially if you know the story of your Jimbo, you know, it makes a lot more sense.

475
00:32:07,262 --> 00:32:11,259
Speaker 1: But there was no desire to see the next episode after watching any of them.

476
00:32:11,922 --> 00:32:16,220
Speaker 1: So there's no way to finish it or you'd have to force yourself to finish it and fuck that.

477
00:32:16,563 --> 00:32:17,698
Speaker 1: Yeah, just don't watch it.

478
00:32:18,121 --> 00:32:19,525
Speaker 0: So I think the bit I remember.

479
00:32:19,585 --> 00:32:24,760
Speaker 0: so when we were at RIT anime there was like the set of robot shows that people recommend.

480
00:32:24,921 --> 00:32:25,042
Speaker 0: Like.

481
00:32:25,062 --> 00:32:37,604
Speaker 0: there was the cluster of robot shows and it was Evangelion Escaflowne Gundam just in general and one of the ones that was always on that list as a must-see robot show was Martian successor Nadeshiko.

482
00:32:37,644 --> 00:32:39,129
Speaker 1: people don't even know that thing any now.

483
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:40,793
Speaker 0: that show was big.

484
00:32:40,874 --> 00:32:43,200
Speaker 0: people cosplayed as it like in the early 2000s.

485
00:32:43,241 --> 00:32:45,447
Speaker 1: that show was a big fucking deal.

486
00:32:45,608 --> 00:32:49,500
Speaker 0: people cosplayed as characters from that like at the RIT anime club costume.

487
00:32:49,741 --> 00:32:52,913
Speaker 1: They all every single time there was like, you know, like merchandise.

488
00:32:52,953 --> 00:32:54,780
Speaker 1: you had seen a deshiko merchandise everywhere.

489
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,020
Speaker 1: Well, I remember seeing tons of Nadeshiko wall scrolls all over the place.

490
00:32:58,582 --> 00:33:09,084
Speaker 0: So I just never watched it and I watched the first episode like four times and every time Didn't look that good and people swore to me was really good But I'm got the DVDs.

491
00:33:09,385 --> 00:33:12,895
Speaker 1: Yep, and after I'd finished watching Evangelion Escaflowne, etc.

492
00:33:12,976 --> 00:33:21,220
Speaker 1: on that train in the Beacon Days I ripped it to put on my iPhone 3G, which is how I watched Evangelion Escaflowne on those trains.

493
00:33:22,163 --> 00:33:22,665
Speaker 1: And I had.

494
00:33:22,745 --> 00:33:31,680
Speaker 1: I had the whole thing on my my phone my iPhone 3G and I still have those Ripped videos in my iTunes of all of Nadeshiko.

495
00:33:31,804 --> 00:33:33,043
Speaker 1: Yeah Why did you watch?

496
00:33:33,345 --> 00:33:37,520
Speaker 1: I watched like three on a train once and I just didn't watch anymore.

497
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:39,488
Speaker 0: I think these same same thing.

498
00:33:39,588 --> 00:33:42,520
Speaker 0: these shows both typify one type of reason why you stop watching.

499
00:33:42,721 --> 00:33:45,036
Speaker 0: These are these are the small roller coaster.

500
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:49,139
Speaker 0: Mmm I probably would have really liked Nadeshiko if I hadn't already seen Ava.

501
00:33:49,481 --> 00:33:51,529
Speaker 0: Maybe probably what I've really liked Kazuno Yojimbo.

502
00:33:51,569 --> 00:33:57,400
Speaker 1: if I'd never seen I don't know like cowboy bebop high school I would have watched the fuck out of any anime you gave me no matter how I got me.

503
00:33:57,761 --> 00:34:02,820
Speaker 0: High school is when I watch shit like Doom Megalopolis and Armageddon because that was all I hadn't seen at blockbuster.

504
00:34:03,324 --> 00:34:05,177
Speaker 1: It's like fatal fury on sci-fi channel.

505
00:34:05,358 --> 00:34:07,710
Speaker 1: Oh, yes Now, you know.

506
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:16,119
Speaker 0: So then there's shows that just like marmalade boy Does anyone listening to geek nights even know what the fuck marmalade boy is?

507
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:21,860
Speaker 1: It was a show a show that only people that were like in anime clubs cared about.

508
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,112
Speaker 0: Yep, that was that was the kind of show is it?

509
00:34:24,132 --> 00:34:32,060
Speaker 0: you know, it's interesting cuz marmalade boy Like only the super anime fans even know existed marmalade boy and Kim Iguirre orange road also same deal.

510
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:32,664
Speaker 0: Those were the two.

511
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:34,958
Speaker 0: those are like the shows like when we were freshmen at our IT.

512
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:37,158
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the romance shoujo shows.

513
00:34:37,501 --> 00:34:39,045
Speaker 1: Yeah that you know.

514
00:34:39,187 --> 00:34:45,449
Speaker 1: the the hardcore anime people knew existed and were way into but no average anime fan ever heard of them ever.

515
00:34:45,549 --> 00:35:03,155
Speaker 0: but it was interesting because if you went to the anime club and You went to conventions with those kinds of people and you were the freshman and they were the seniors You got the impression that marmalade boy and Kim Iguirre orange road were huge shows Really important really popular like they would just talk about this shit.

516
00:35:03,436 --> 00:35:11,867
Speaker 0: They showed the Christmas special from kor for the Christmas showing at the anime club and the audience like oh my god it's the kor like.

517
00:35:11,908 --> 00:35:20,133
Speaker 0: they called it kor and The shows were not that good and they're completely forgotten now except by people like us.

518
00:35:20,534 --> 00:35:22,540
Speaker 0: and even then we were too young for those shows.

519
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,389
Speaker 1: Right that you know, they were acting like they were a big deal.

520
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:34,449
Speaker 1: But now, you know, if you watch like, you know Japanese television it's like you don't see a lot of References to marmalade boy.

521
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:36,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, you see fist of the North Star jokes all the time.

522
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:37,383
Speaker 1: Those guys didn't.

523
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:40,274
Speaker 1: I had no one talked about fist the North Star at the RIT anime club.

524
00:35:40,776 --> 00:35:41,238
Speaker 1: No one.

525
00:35:41,358 --> 00:35:42,958
Speaker 1: Yeah Why not?

526
00:35:43,780 --> 00:35:44,540
Speaker 0: I knew it existed.

527
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:48,252
Speaker 0: I wonder if it's because I think marmalade boy wasn't didn't?

528
00:35:48,653 --> 00:35:49,034
Speaker 0: Greg?

529
00:35:49,075 --> 00:35:50,680
Speaker 0: young fans of a bunch of that.

530
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:51,364
Speaker 1: He did.

531
00:35:51,384 --> 00:35:52,471
Speaker 0: I guess there was.

532
00:35:52,511 --> 00:35:53,497
Speaker 0: you know that they.

533
00:35:53,517 --> 00:35:58,176
Speaker 0: you know We were talking about how Miku on letterman is like the end of one generation the beginning of another.

534
00:35:58,256 --> 00:35:58,376
Speaker 0: like.

535
00:35:58,397 --> 00:35:59,300
Speaker 0: that's the Nexus point.

536
00:36:00,046 --> 00:36:15,120
Speaker 0: I feel like that year the year 2000-2001 was this Nexus point between the last of the anime fandom that went to conventions to copy VHS tapes and the first of the anime fandom that had the internet and didn't give a shit about fan subbers.

537
00:36:16,047 --> 00:36:17,359
Speaker 0: Like that was the big turning point.

538
00:36:18,182 --> 00:36:23,436
Speaker 0: So I feel like if you want like I almost want to watch kor to review it.

539
00:36:23,917 --> 00:36:24,358
Speaker 1: it's all you.

540
00:36:24,659 --> 00:36:25,869
Speaker 0: maybe That's the problem.

541
00:36:25,889 --> 00:36:26,617
Speaker 0: You're not gonna watch it.

542
00:36:27,462 --> 00:36:29,248
Speaker 0: We could just watch the movie.

543
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,352
Speaker 1: It's all you.

544
00:36:30,773 --> 00:36:31,917
Speaker 0: Why are you poking me with the microphones?

545
00:36:31,937 --> 00:36:32,479
Speaker 0: Does that want to?

546
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:35,374
Speaker 0: No kor I did.

547
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:44,160
Speaker 0: I Watched the movie and I saw a bunch of AMVs about marmalade boy and marmalade boy looks really creepy.

548
00:36:44,341 --> 00:36:45,971
Speaker 0: I don't get the impression.

549
00:36:46,012 --> 00:36:47,279
Speaker 0: It's actually that funny.

550
00:36:48,162 --> 00:36:57,100
Speaker 1: And if you want to watch something somewhat romantic just watch touch Which is actually really important and significant and good or watch for Shiki Yugi, which I guess is better than on those two.

551
00:36:57,340 --> 00:37:00,490
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've talked about this in panels a lot and we're talking on the show for Shiki.

552
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:03,460
Speaker 0: Yugi was the full metal alchemist of its era.

553
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:05,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a big fucking deal.

554
00:37:05,821 --> 00:37:09,375
Speaker 1: You know just like and even shows, you know, what else is a big deal right then?

555
00:37:09,395 --> 00:37:10,580
Speaker 1: Inuyasha was a big deal.

556
00:37:10,846 --> 00:37:20,909
Speaker 1: Yeah No one talks about fucking Inuyasha except to say that shows too damn long Inuyasha's when I realized that Rumiko Takahashi can't fucking end a story, right but No one talks about Inuyasha anymore.

557
00:37:20,929 --> 00:37:22,356
Speaker 1: It was a big deal then.

558
00:37:22,417 --> 00:37:23,020
Speaker 1: now no deal.

559
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what?

560
00:37:23,662 --> 00:37:28,400
Speaker 0: The people who talk about Inuyasha will obsess about the closing song from for Shiki Yugi.

561
00:37:28,721 --> 00:37:29,563
Speaker 0: I guarantee it.

562
00:37:29,904 --> 00:37:35,940
Speaker 0: if anyone ever mentions Inuyasha to you ask them what they think of the song that ended the first season of for Shiki Yugi.

563
00:37:38,204 --> 00:37:41,438
Speaker 0: I'll bet a small amount of money that they will have an opinion about that.

564
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:52,020
Speaker 0: maybe Because well I was talking to Basically a for Joshi - that is that is the self-described label for this person and we were talking about Gundam.

565
00:37:52,101 --> 00:38:02,759
Speaker 0: see there's a couple years ago and what they said was Gundam seed did the for Shiki Yugi thing and I was like and I paused and I was like.

566
00:38:03,462 --> 00:38:27,429
Speaker 0: You mean the closing song starts like a minute before the episode ends sometimes and they were like exactly And they were really into Inuyasha - But yeah Those shows like you'd go to an Otakon and there'd be like a million Miyakas like half the cosplay skits were Bianca Tomahome Miyaka, I don't think anyone would get that reference anymore.

567
00:38:27,449 --> 00:38:29,516
Speaker 1: No, I'm sure someone does listen.

568
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,404
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know we never reviewed that.

569
00:38:31,464 --> 00:38:33,012
Speaker 0: actually we probably showed his koto chat.

570
00:38:34,860 --> 00:38:35,805
Speaker 1: That's actually a good show.

571
00:38:35,825 --> 00:38:36,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's also forgotten.

572
00:38:37,313 --> 00:38:38,277
Speaker 0: Well, how much of that is you see?

573
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,840
Speaker 0: Have you seen we watch the like that compilation kind of movie?

574
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've seen like a movie and I think I fell asleep during it cuz it wasn't yeah.

575
00:38:45,101 --> 00:38:48,272
Speaker 0: And well you fell asleep during easily half the anime we watched it.

576
00:38:48,352 --> 00:38:48,874
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

577
00:38:49,155 --> 00:38:50,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, great digital target.

578
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:52,592
Speaker 0: I remember you fell asleep during the middle of mm-hmm.

579
00:38:52,934 --> 00:38:53,819
Speaker 0: Not that you missed anything.

580
00:38:55,661 --> 00:39:04,620
Speaker 0: In retrospect whenever you fell asleep what we should have done is paused it and Just waited for you to sleep for a while and then wake unpause it and wake you up.

581
00:39:04,781 --> 00:39:10,098
Speaker 0: So you would just have these weird memories of like eight hour long anime Or we could have just watched Odeon.

582
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:12,919
Speaker 1: Then we'd all fall asleep.

583
00:39:13,806 --> 00:39:15,216
Speaker 0: I actually haven't seen all of koto cha.

584
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:21,240
Speaker 0: in fact I think my primary exposure to koto cha was actually that caffeine and conium AMV.

585
00:39:24,085 --> 00:39:24,490
Speaker 1: It's funny.

586
00:39:24,511 --> 00:39:27,011
Speaker 0: yeah Cute funny show.

587
00:39:27,032 --> 00:39:28,360
Speaker 0: there's not a lot of other shows like it.

588
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:33,897
Speaker 0: It's it's got the kind of humor that modern moe shows pretend to have but are really just pornography.

589
00:39:33,917 --> 00:39:38,069
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Magic Knight rare I just remembered.

590
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:39,275
Speaker 0: that's a show that I didn't you.

591
00:39:39,335 --> 00:39:40,500
Speaker 0: I couldn't even sit through the marathon.

592
00:39:40,681 --> 00:39:43,791
Speaker 1: I had the manga which came out again recently, which is why I have it.

593
00:39:44,233 --> 00:39:51,760
Speaker 0: In fact, that was the the first Marathon at the RIT anime club that I went to and then I was like, yeah, fuck it.

594
00:39:51,861 --> 00:39:53,634
Speaker 0: I just left after like nine episodes.

595
00:39:53,654 --> 00:39:54,198
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

596
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,985
Speaker 0: But that's another one of those shows that people.

597
00:39:56,446 --> 00:40:01,020
Speaker 0: it was popular enough in its era that everyone would refer to it by an acronym.

598
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:06,779
Speaker 0: That was MKR and everyone everyone knew exactly what you were talking about whether or not they've seen it.

599
00:40:07,783 --> 00:40:08,967
Speaker 0: Do you want to watch MKR?

600
00:40:08,987 --> 00:40:10,833
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what it is.

601
00:40:10,853 --> 00:40:12,740
Speaker 0: I had the manga read the manga.

602
00:40:12,961 --> 00:40:13,925
Speaker 1: Yeah, I read a whole bunch of it.

603
00:40:14,065 --> 00:40:15,210
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm not all of it though.

604
00:40:15,632 --> 00:40:17,660
Speaker 1: No, it's a few big fat books.

605
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:19,939
Speaker 0: So why are we watching Sailor Moon, but not MKR?

606
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:23,348
Speaker 1: Because Sailor Moon's actually entertaining.

607
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:25,698
Speaker 0: why what's the difference?

608
00:40:28,761 --> 00:40:29,096
Speaker 1: Punishment.

609
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,685
Speaker 1: Yes That's a narrator doesn't have that kind of shit.

610
00:40:34,805 --> 00:40:36,009
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't it has.

611
00:40:36,229 --> 00:40:52,120
Speaker 0: actually MKR is more like half Sailor Moon half Slayers, but with not the humor part of slayers the dramatic part of slayers Mmm, as I recall I actually haven't seen him care in a long long time And even then I'd see like random episodes along the way.

612
00:40:55,362 --> 00:40:55,784
Speaker 0: You know what else?

613
00:40:55,804 --> 00:40:56,667
Speaker 0: we never reviewed this.

614
00:40:56,727 --> 00:41:00,360
Speaker 0: actually a pretty big and good show lotus war and oh my goddess.

615
00:41:00,962 --> 00:41:01,363
Speaker 1: Well, okay.

616
00:41:01,383 --> 00:41:02,406
Speaker 1: So those are two different shows.

617
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:03,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're both.

618
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,882
Speaker 0: they're both like early formative American fandom show right.

619
00:41:06,902 --> 00:41:12,652
Speaker 1: so lotus war when you went to like You know the FYE whatever in their VHS tapes of anime.

620
00:41:12,712 --> 00:41:18,091
Speaker 1: in the late 90s lotus war TV Those red boxed ones were always there everywhere.

621
00:41:18,131 --> 00:41:20,480
Speaker 1: They were widely distributed and easily accessible.

622
00:41:20,621 --> 00:41:23,279
Speaker 1: So that's that sort of made it a bigger deal than it needs to be.

623
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:27,552
Speaker 1: Of course lotus or OVA is the only thing that's actually good besides lotus island.

624
00:41:27,933 --> 00:41:36,259
Speaker 0: It's not actually good in my opinion In retrospect having watched it again relatively recently when was recent like three years ago.

625
00:41:37,183 --> 00:41:41,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we watched it at beacon once and I think we did do an episode on it.

626
00:41:41,441 --> 00:41:43,308
Speaker 0: I couldn't find one in a cursory search.

627
00:41:43,569 --> 00:41:43,770
Speaker 1: All right.

628
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:55,705
Speaker 0: Well in my opinion lotus war Was great for me as a kid only because I was D&D starved Yep, and it was anime about D&D.

629
00:41:55,985 --> 00:41:56,145
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

630
00:41:56,446 --> 00:42:01,379
Speaker 0: That is the only reason I liked it and Part of it was that I could only for a while.

631
00:42:01,479 --> 00:42:04,090
Speaker 0: I only had access to like the first two episodes ish.

632
00:42:04,831 --> 00:42:09,950
Speaker 0: So I was really obsessed with what happened later Just like Erislan heroic legend of our salon.

633
00:42:09,990 --> 00:42:12,362
Speaker 0: Like I was really obsessed with like what happens next.

634
00:42:12,784 --> 00:42:13,990
Speaker 0: and then I watched the end of lotus war.

635
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:17,909
Speaker 0: It was like I didn't really go anywhere and then I found out there was no more Arslan.

636
00:42:19,050 --> 00:42:20,177
Speaker 1: No, something happened.

637
00:42:20,217 --> 00:42:22,410
Speaker 1: The Arslan manga is still going for the anime.

638
00:42:22,651 --> 00:42:25,988
Speaker 1: I think this actually I've read a news about like something big is happening in it.

639
00:42:26,028 --> 00:42:29,556
Speaker 1: soon There's like a special announcement or something.

640
00:42:29,637 --> 00:42:30,319
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might.

641
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:31,443
Speaker 1: I could be that it's ending.

642
00:42:31,484 --> 00:42:32,768
Speaker 1: it could be a big twist is happening.

643
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:33,090
Speaker 1: Who knows?

644
00:42:34,551 --> 00:42:36,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm I goddess like that was.

645
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:38,670
Speaker 0: that was another one of those like ridiculously popular forever.

646
00:42:38,690 --> 00:42:39,776
Speaker 1: That was a lot like Nadesha.

647
00:42:39,817 --> 00:42:40,823
Speaker 1: go where it was everywhere.

648
00:42:40,863 --> 00:42:42,070
Speaker 1: There was much for it everywhere.

649
00:42:42,231 --> 00:42:46,650
Speaker 1: They're everywhere and part of that was cuz dark cars dark horse is pushing the manga really hard.

650
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:52,070
Speaker 0: Yeah in the US and also I mean there was the original OAV and then there's like a bunch of other related things.

651
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:53,496
Speaker 0: Oh my god of stuff that came later.

652
00:42:53,557 --> 00:42:56,510
Speaker 1: There's the movie the manga finally ended sometime recently.

653
00:42:57,651 --> 00:42:58,896
Speaker 1: Yeah, super long-running.

654
00:42:59,077 --> 00:43:00,744
Speaker 0: I wonder if they ever had sex.

655
00:43:01,648 --> 00:43:02,130
Speaker 1: I don't know.

656
00:43:02,150 --> 00:43:09,810
Speaker 0: That's actually all I wondered because that nothing nothing fucking half the art was beautiful, but nothing fucking happened in that manga.

657
00:43:10,131 --> 00:43:10,634
Speaker 1: That's really.

658
00:43:10,855 --> 00:43:11,538
Speaker 1: that's the one thing.

659
00:43:11,578 --> 00:43:11,920
Speaker 1: I remember.

660
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:16,096
Speaker 1: Oh my god is there was like they were real Number one thing that you would hear about.

661
00:43:16,136 --> 00:43:22,854
Speaker 1: it was and see in all of the merchandise and other artifacts was just like how crazy Amazingly art was.

662
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:24,179
Speaker 1: you know it looked like.

663
00:43:24,279 --> 00:43:26,970
Speaker 1: you know super colorful and clean and sharp.

664
00:43:28,091 --> 00:43:29,857
Speaker 1: You know designs like in the.

665
00:43:29,877 --> 00:43:33,970
Speaker 1: you know the CG days that we have now where computers are even used to make 2d animation.

666
00:43:34,492 --> 00:43:36,460
Speaker 1: But it was hand-drawn in the olden days.

667
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,146
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it was like wow.

668
00:43:38,206 --> 00:43:39,150
Speaker 1: It's just a TV show.

669
00:43:39,210 --> 00:43:46,795
Speaker 0: It's not even like a Kira movie or anything, but look at the way It looks, but I feel like we should actually cuz I haven't seen it a long time And I don't think you've ever seen it.

670
00:43:47,337 --> 00:43:49,808
Speaker 0: We should watch and review the original.

671
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:51,439
Speaker 0: Oh my god Sure you go get on that.

672
00:43:53,532 --> 00:43:55,917
Speaker 0: Well, it's five episodes Scott.

673
00:43:56,318 --> 00:44:01,350
Speaker 0: That is that is less than like one mid arc of Sailor Moon.

674
00:44:04,211 --> 00:44:07,380
Speaker 1: Are they 20 minute or is it an OAV where they're longer there?

675
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,382
Speaker 0: I think they're 23 minutes.

676
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:19,790
Speaker 0: I haven't seen him in a long time Yep, and actually I remembers I skipped I think the third episode because the tape at anime club like wouldn't play in my VCR.

677
00:44:20,696 --> 00:44:21,450
Speaker 0: So I skipped that one.

678
00:44:21,490 --> 00:44:35,569
Speaker 0: I never ended up seeing it and actually despite owning it and having paid $25 to the DVD when it came out I never actually watched the oh my god is movie mm-hmm Just for whatever reason wasn't that the one that you cosplayed as?

679
00:44:36,511 --> 00:44:38,196
Speaker 0: Yes, that was the one I cosplayed as.

680
00:44:38,558 --> 00:44:40,565
Speaker 1: yeah that one had like the even better arts.

681
00:44:40,625 --> 00:44:42,792
Speaker 1: people were like losing their shit over how That movie looked.

682
00:44:42,993 --> 00:44:45,945
Speaker 0: yeah, I remember we showed it at the anime club and people like lined up.

683
00:44:46,085 --> 00:44:47,310
Speaker 1: and wasn't it a really bad movie?

684
00:44:47,411 --> 00:44:47,716
Speaker 0: I don't know.

685
00:44:47,898 --> 00:44:48,568
Speaker 0: I didn't watch it.

686
00:44:49,774 --> 00:44:51,660
Speaker 0: I was running the club when I ran the club.

687
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,487
Speaker 0: I couldn't watch any goddamn anime.

688
00:44:53,647 --> 00:44:54,249
Speaker 1: I didn't watch that.

689
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:57,645
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz we lie everyone lined up and actually had to kick people out of the room.

690
00:44:57,786 --> 00:45:00,827
Speaker 1: actually one of the reasons I didn't the main reason any watch is cuz I'd never seen any other.

691
00:45:00,907 --> 00:45:01,290
Speaker 1: oh my goddess.

692
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:03,949
Speaker 1: And I was like well this isn't gonna make any sense to someone who's never seen any of it.

693
00:45:04,472 --> 00:45:06,482
Speaker 1: I thought it was like you know an ending movie or something like that.

694
00:45:06,743 --> 00:45:06,924
Speaker 0: No.

695
00:45:06,964 --> 00:45:08,170
Speaker 0: It's not like the third tenchi movie.

696
00:45:08,311 --> 00:45:09,337
Speaker 1: It's a compilation movie.

697
00:45:09,719 --> 00:45:11,370
Speaker 0: I feel like we'd know it's just you could watch.

698
00:45:11,430 --> 00:45:12,414
Speaker 0: It's like the tenchi movie.

699
00:45:12,614 --> 00:45:17,190
Speaker 0: you can watch the first tenchi movie knowing nothing about tenchi, and it's a fine movie.

700
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:20,084
Speaker 1: It's like the Sailor Moon movie reviewed where it's candy something.

701
00:45:20,104 --> 00:45:22,293
Speaker 0: yeah, basically like the movie Just like it's fine.

702
00:45:22,614 --> 00:45:23,658
Speaker 0: You don't need to know anything.

703
00:45:23,939 --> 00:45:28,103
Speaker 0: the movie will reveal everything you need to know and just throw you into it And it's fine.

704
00:45:29,632 --> 00:45:30,176
Speaker 0: Actually, you know what.

705
00:45:30,197 --> 00:45:33,136
Speaker 0: that reminds me of Why you a?

706
00:45:33,156 --> 00:45:36,330
Speaker 0: hmm another one of those acronym shows yeah?

Speaker 1: all I know about is is comedy police girls.

709
00:45:41,051 --> 00:45:50,669
Speaker 0: Well, we show the the episode with the hurricane and there's the phantom speeder Who only comes during hurricanes and goes speeding because the cops can't catch him.

710
00:45:51,453 --> 00:45:54,529
Speaker 0: We showed that like every year is a tradition to the anime club mm-hmm.

711
00:45:55,251 --> 00:45:56,154

Speaker 0: you know what it was.

713
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:59,789
Speaker 0: it reminded me a lot of palabor in the sense that it's like.

714
00:46:00,451 --> 00:46:13,610
Speaker 0: It's that camaraderie comedy of a bunch of people who have a sort of police military kind of job But it mostly focuses on just them and their own like personal funny drama and also rhythm and police or gunsmith kids.

715
00:46:14,073 --> 00:46:16,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not called rhythm and police I know.

00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:32,730
Speaker 1: cuz I remember it even though I've seen all of it even the TV episode.

722
00:46:32,891 --> 00:46:35,969
Speaker 0: It's a Japanese phrase that I kept fucking messing up.

Speaker 0: we I do better.

732
00:46:57,871 --> 00:46:58,657
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look right now.

734
00:46:59,302 --> 00:47:00,270
Speaker 0: we didn't do an episode on that.

735
00:47:00,431 --> 00:47:04,230
Speaker 0: We're doing an episode on it like next Wednesday, even though it's not even animated.

736
00:47:08,210 --> 00:47:12,068
Speaker 0: I Feel like we could watch why you a do a review of it.

737
00:47:12,591 --> 00:47:13,073
Speaker 1: You'll find it.

738
00:47:13,093 --> 00:47:19,410
Speaker 1: a lot of these animes are ones that are so off the radar now Because they were just sort of hot flashes in the pan in the u.s.

739
00:47:19,510 --> 00:47:22,040
Speaker 1: At least that it's not the easiest to go.

740
00:47:22,081 --> 00:47:22,904
Speaker 1: get them these days.

741
00:47:23,386 --> 00:47:27,878
Speaker 1: if you don't have them already You got to find an old DVD or an old fan sub.

742
00:47:27,938 --> 00:47:31,829
Speaker 1: or hope someone's still seeing the torrent or someone crazies on an IRC.

743
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:40,426
Speaker 0: Okay on June 22nd 2011 We did an episode about anime that only you or I had watched that the other one hadn't watched.

744
00:47:40,987 --> 00:47:49,369
Speaker 0: and in the middle of that We talked about Bayside Shakedown Even though we'd both seen it and we even have a note here saying even though we both have seen it.

745
00:47:50,731 --> 00:47:54,630
Speaker 0: So I guess we that's the only time we ever talked about a very similar episode of geek nights.

746
00:47:54,670 --> 00:47:56,496
Speaker 1: We want a very similar tangent.

747
00:47:56,557 --> 00:48:02,210
Speaker 1: I have a feeling that if we listen to that old episode of geek nights Here's the list.

748
00:48:04,235 --> 00:48:06,501
Speaker 0: The anime list does not overlap at all.

749
00:48:06,601 --> 00:48:07,282
Speaker 1: real interesting.

750
00:48:07,323 --> 00:48:10,330
Speaker 0: Here's the list of anime we talked about on that episode Wolverine.

751
00:48:10,591 --> 00:48:13,319
Speaker 1: So I'm a no meta x-men none of the.

00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:47,210

785
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,620
Speaker 1: I think I did put your effort into it tonight.

786

Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I'm hungry.

788
00:49:54,585 --> 00:49:58,562
Speaker 0: so Full metal alchemist, you know was the fushigi.

789
00:49:58,643 --> 00:50:00,550
Speaker 0: it was the biggest goddamn thing ever.

790
00:50:00,671 --> 00:50:01,699
Speaker 1: We haven't done an episode on.

791
00:50:01,861 --> 00:50:04,343
Speaker 0: we did but you know We never watched the other ones.

792
00:50:04,364 --> 00:50:04,970
Speaker 1: remember the movie.

793
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:08,465
Speaker 0: We didn't watch the movie of conqueror Shambala or whatever that was supposed to like.

794
00:50:08,586 --> 00:50:12,664
Speaker 0: answer all those questions Because remember did not see the anime diverged from the manga.

795
00:50:12,965 --> 00:50:13,930
Speaker 0: We watched the anime.

796
00:50:14,211 --> 00:50:31,928
Speaker 0: It was the best thing or the biggest thing ever at least like we watched every episode as it came out and it ended like During the Blitz like during like the interwar period in regular earth With a bunch of bullshit and then the movie was gonna explain it all.

797
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:36,580
Speaker 0: the movie Because everyone else said the movie was so bad.

798
00:50:36,600 --> 00:50:38,306
Speaker 0: I never watched it.

799
00:50:38,346 --> 00:50:40,173
Speaker 1: I Didn't watch it either.

800
00:50:40,193 --> 00:50:42,363
Speaker 1: I have all the manga actually, but I haven't read it all.

801
00:50:43,569 --> 00:50:47,402
Speaker 0: and Then Brotherhood came out and I just wasn't interested.

802
00:50:47,783 --> 00:50:59,250
Speaker 0: and I think Dave I remember they were he was remember listen to he was talking about how we started watching Brotherhood and It kind of sucked because at the beginning pretty much is the same as the original anime.

803
00:51:00,151 --> 00:51:06,739
Speaker 0: But then he ended up going back to check because he washed like the original one and he ended up just watching the original one All the way through again instead.

804
00:51:06,981 --> 00:51:09,757
Speaker 0: I Don't think I'll ever watch Brotherhood.

805
00:51:09,797 --> 00:51:10,841
Speaker 0: I just have no interest.

806
00:51:10,942 --> 00:51:15,858
Speaker 0: and no one is supposedly the same as the manga Yes, meaning it diverges from the original anime.

807
00:51:15,918 --> 00:51:19,630
Speaker 1: So if I just read the manga that I own I'll be all set.

808
00:51:19,891 --> 00:51:24,009
Speaker 1: I guess I mostly just want to read all that manga so I won't feel bad about then selling it.

809
00:51:24,271 --> 00:51:26,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm getting it off making shelf space open up.

810
00:51:28,333 --> 00:51:39,025
Speaker 0: all right, I think we'll just cut it off here because Frankly, I got some cool stuff to do tomorrow that I'm gonna talk about Once I find out if I can talk about it or not and then I go go to Australia.
