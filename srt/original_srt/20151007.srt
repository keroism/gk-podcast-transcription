1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,449
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, October 7th, 2015.

2
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:10,770
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,748 --> 00:00:14,138
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:15,966
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,387 --> 00:00:20,100
Speaker 0: Tonight, we review Colorful and Rick and Morty.

6
00:00:22,202 --> 00:00:23,219
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,471 --> 00:00:29,038
Speaker 0: So, a lot of you bother me.

8
00:00:29,158 --> 00:00:33,590
Speaker 0: I'd say easily a full third of all the messages I get through like G+ and YouTube.

9
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:36,684
Speaker 0: Are you people asking me when we're going to do more?

10
00:00:36,704 --> 00:00:37,750
Speaker 0: Geek Nights Presents Sultana?

11
00:00:38,032 --> 00:00:39,019
Speaker 1: Let me get some time.

12
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,128
Speaker 1: What do you think this is?

13
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:44,229
Speaker 0: Basically, if you noticed, we were going strong on that until the sun came out.

14
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,030
Speaker 0: And then it didn't happen much for a while.

15
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:51,490
Speaker 0: But the other thing was we deal with a lot of copyright crap on YouTube.

16
00:00:52,413 --> 00:00:54,724
Speaker 0: Like even our panels, we get copyrighted sometimes.

17
00:00:54,745 --> 00:00:55,689
Speaker 0: I gotta go deal with it.

18
00:00:56,330 --> 00:01:06,070
Speaker 0: But the Utena videos have generated more copyright lawsuit threat nonsense than everything else we have ever done combined.

19
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:12,930
Speaker 0: So, if you wonder why we stopped doing Radio Free Equestria way back, that's one of the reasons.

20
00:01:14,311 --> 00:01:21,290
Speaker 0: So, luckily, the reason I'm talking about this is that the biggest threat to that show has been averted.

21
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:29,330
Speaker 0: Because I was getting not just the claim it and monetize it nonsense that I get from like Jan Endemol or all the like.

22
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:32,481
Speaker 0: I'm the Italian distributor of Utena.

23
00:01:32,702 --> 00:01:34,630
Speaker 0: We don't understand fair use in this country.

24
00:01:36,415 --> 00:01:41,970
Speaker 0: I got straight up like the videos were all taken down, blocked globally by King Records.

25
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:45,170
Speaker 0: So, I had to tread a little carefully there.

26
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:51,010
Speaker 0: So, the long story short is I fought one of them, you know, the proper way.

27
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:54,250
Speaker 0: And something happened that has never happened before.

28
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,230
Speaker 0: So, honestly, props to King Records.

29
00:01:56,991 --> 00:02:03,369
Speaker 0: They released the claim on the video based on my dispute about four hours after I did it.

30
00:02:04,092 --> 00:02:07,210
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, like all these other garbage companies, they don't respond.

31
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:13,890
Speaker 0: They either wait the full 30 days before the copyright thing disappears or they send me, like they reinstate it.

32
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:20,050
Speaker 0: And then I have to go through the like one step away from lawyers, DMCA takedown, DMCA counter notification.

33
00:02:20,511 --> 00:02:21,213
Speaker 0: Here's my address.

34
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:25,190
Speaker 0: You have 15 days to actually sue me and prove to Google that you sued me.

35
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,823
Speaker 0: So, King Records actually dealt with it.

36
00:02:29,333 --> 00:02:39,850
Speaker 0: And if any of you are interested in how this stuff goes down, I will link to you the specific words that I wrote that are the like official legally binding.

37
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,530
Speaker 1: Yes, give people legal advice.

38
00:02:43,619 --> 00:02:45,790
Speaker 0: I was about to say I am not giving legal advice.

39
00:02:46,773 --> 00:02:48,521
Speaker 1: If you give legal advice, it's still.

40
00:02:48,561 --> 00:02:50,450
Speaker 1: you're giving legal advice even if you say you're not.

41
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,374
Speaker 0: No, but I'm not.

42
00:02:51,454 --> 00:02:52,844
Speaker 0: I'm not advising you to do anything.

43
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:53,749
Speaker 0: All I'm saying is.

44
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,069
Speaker 1: I am not advising you to do anything, but do this.

45
00:02:57,351 --> 00:02:57,712
Speaker 0: I'm not.

46
00:02:57,833 --> 00:03:00,021
Speaker 1: I wasn't about to say you're not doing something.

47
00:03:00,082 --> 00:03:02,110
Speaker 1: still doesn't make it so that you're not doing it.

48
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,336
Speaker 1: You have to not do it.

49
00:03:03,497 --> 00:03:05,730
Speaker 1: You have to think like I'm not jumping up and down.

50
00:03:06,452 --> 00:03:08,710
Speaker 0: You have to think like an as to die.

51
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:11,950
Speaker 0: So listen to the exact words that I'm about to say.

52
00:03:12,412 --> 00:03:15,550
Speaker 0: I am not a lawyer and I am not advising you to do anything.

53
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:23,610
Speaker 0: But here is what I did when I received takedowns on my clearly fair use videos on YouTube.

54
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:33,669
Speaker 0: A lawyer, a real lawyer who was not paid by me and was not giving me legal advice looked at this and did not tell me I was a moron.

55
00:03:35,971 --> 00:03:39,823
Speaker 0: So take that as you will, but this is what I did and it works.

56
00:03:40,024 --> 00:03:53,130
Speaker 0: because actually, seriously, King Records is the only organization in all the time I've used YouTube that has ever actually responded to one of my disputes correctly and in a timely fashion.

57
00:03:53,832 --> 00:04:00,330
Speaker 0: I salute you because seriously, that never happens and that's the bar we're at when it comes to fair use.

58
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:07,130
Speaker 1: Also, there's plenty of videos on YouTube with Utena music in them that aren't taken down.

59
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:11,210
Speaker 1: I can still watch Oh Baby Baby whenever I need to, but I guess that's not Utena music.

60
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:22,989
Speaker 0: It's also weird because I get to see the exact clips that they trigger on and it is surprising sometimes what three second clip these things will peg on to.

61
00:04:24,332 --> 00:04:28,150
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's what I've been doing with my spare time since I got back from Australia.

62
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,250
Speaker 1: Alright, so here's a tiny news, but it's exciting for people who care and people who don't care don't need to care.

63
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:41,170
Speaker 1: So just say it and be done with it, but they just confirmed one of the best animes recently, Yoah Peddle will have a third season.

64
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,530
Speaker 1: Also, there's a movie that came out in the summer that I still haven't seen.

65
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,590
Speaker 0: So the third season will cover the last 50 feet of the race, right?

66
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,410
Speaker 1: They finished that race at the end of the second season.

67
00:04:50,672 --> 00:04:51,849
Speaker 0: At the end of the second season?

68
00:04:52,316 --> 00:04:52,569
Speaker 1: Yep.

69
00:04:53,073 --> 00:04:54,089
Speaker 0: When did that race start?

70
00:04:55,470 --> 00:04:56,670
Speaker 1: Towards the end of the first season.

71
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,409
Speaker 1: See, Initial D- It was a three day race.

72
00:05:00,630 --> 00:05:01,950
Speaker 0: Initial D- Three days.

73
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,130
Speaker 1: Would start a race- Initial D races in real time, last like minutes.

74
00:05:07,452 --> 00:05:08,649
Speaker 1: This is a three day race.

75
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:12,910
Speaker 1: It actually goes to the same pace as an Initial D. If you measure it by real time.

76
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:26,830
Speaker 0: That is true, because Initial D would start a race- It might even be faster than Initial D. At the end of an episode, get to the very end of the race as the entire next episode, and then finish the race at the beginning of the third episode.

77
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:28,659
Speaker 1: Everything should be like Fist of the North Star.

78
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:30,530
Speaker 1: Fight starts and ends within a minute.

79
00:05:30,932 --> 00:05:31,014
Speaker 0: Boom!

80
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:31,402
Speaker 0: Dead.

81
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,430
Speaker 0: I can name at least one show that is also like it.

82
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,030
Speaker 1: The second season of Fist of the North Star.

83
00:05:37,231 --> 00:05:38,598
Speaker 0: Two shows, but no, one show.

84
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,710
Speaker 0: A man who punches people one time.

85
00:05:41,211 --> 00:05:44,520
Speaker 1: Well, that you have not seen enough of, so you do not realize.

86
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:48,370
Speaker 1: there are many fights he gets into where he simply does not punch for a while.

87
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,230
Speaker 0: I'm considering- A fight does not begin until a punch is thrown.

88
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:53,364
Speaker 1: Many other people are fighting though, but not him.

89
00:05:53,384 --> 00:05:54,169
Speaker 1: He's standing back.

90
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:54,732
Speaker 0: Oh.

91
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:56,088
Speaker 1: And not punching.

92
00:05:56,874 --> 00:06:01,790
Speaker 1: You know what- Or he doesn't get his opportunity to punch until a bunch of talking and exposition and other things have happened.

93
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,664
Speaker 0: You know, as much as I make fun of that stuff, I mean, I like slayers, right?

94
00:06:04,684 --> 00:06:08,970
Speaker 0: Like, we all like slayers, but- Slayers, which is also- Slayers is just- We'll talk about that in a second.

95
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,909
Speaker 0: It's just I'm standing around going, "Ma ma ma ma ma ma ma ma, but with full power, blah blah

96
00:06:12,949 --> 00:06:13,050
Speaker 0: blah.".

97
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:16,190
Speaker 0: It's Dragon Ball with good, funny Fish Man jokes.

98
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,609
Speaker 1: Dragon Ball also is funny Fish Man.

99
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're not as funny.

100
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:24,610
Speaker 0: I think Slayers has the highest form, the highest tier of funny Fish Man.

101
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:25,292
Speaker 1: Yes, it does.

102
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:31,030
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, yeah, the New York Pedal season, but the real thing I want to talk about is a Geek Bite of Hulu.

103
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,527
Speaker 1: Now, you might say, "But Hulu's so old, and that's a weird thing to Geek Bite.

104
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:34,769
Speaker 1: What the

105
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:35,010
Speaker 1: hell?".

106
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,994
Speaker 1: Well, here's what happened.

107
00:06:36,596 --> 00:06:40,250
Speaker 1: I had Crunchyroll subscription, and with my Crunchyroll subscription, I was watching many things.

108
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:45,430
Speaker 1: I watched that show where the kid goes to the farm school, Silver Spoon.

109
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:45,975
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

110
00:06:45,995 --> 00:06:46,849
Speaker 1: That's a good show.

111
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:52,386
Speaker 1: I watched a little bit of those, some weird shows like Horror News and, you know, Fairy Folk Tales.

112
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:56,715
Speaker 0: Most of the anime I was watching was free Crunchyroll.

113
00:06:57,015 --> 00:07:01,684
Speaker 0: Of course, Emily had Crunchyrolls, actually, so I didn't have to use the free tier, just if she wasn't home and I didn't want to log in.

114
00:07:06,091 --> 00:07:08,315
Speaker 1: Back in the day, I also watched a lot of shows on Crunchyroll.

115
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:16,610
Speaker 1: I watched some Fist of the Northster episodes on there that I couldn't download as easily, and I watched all of Galaxy Express and Captain Harlock.

116
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:18,410
Speaker 1: I watched a lot of shows on Crunchyroll.

117
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:20,530
Speaker 0: But recently, everything I was watching was on Funimation.

118
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:32,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it got to the point where a lot of shows I was watching, I wanted to watch, were on Crunchyroll, and the ones on Crunchyroll, I was finishing up, and they weren't being replaced by new shows on there.

119
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:35,379
Speaker 1: So I'm like, well, Hulu's got this new service.

120
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:39,030
Speaker 1: I already had Netflix and cleaned it out and cancelled that to switch to Crunchyroll.

121
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:42,710
Speaker 1: Hulu just added no commercial mode, and well, South Park just started.

122
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:44,453
Speaker 0: Now, no commercial mode on Hulu.

123
00:07:44,473 --> 00:07:50,266
Speaker 0: We're not going to talk about it today because it's a big topic, but that is a big goddamn deal.

124
00:07:50,527 --> 00:07:51,970
Speaker 0: That's a game changer.

125
00:07:52,190 --> 00:08:04,110
Speaker 1: So I'm like, well, I'll see no commercial on Hulu if I pay, and I'll just cancel Crunchyroll, and I can at least watch South Park with no ads and a bunch of other things that I want to watch.

126
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:05,272
Speaker 1: So I did this, and you know what?

127
00:08:05,552 --> 00:08:17,010
Speaker 1: First of all, the only shows that are on Crunchyroll that I wanted to watch that aren't on Hulu are those weird tiny ones like the Yamashibais and the folk tales and the horror news.

128
00:08:17,952 --> 00:08:24,686
Speaker 1: All the major animes, the Yoah Pedals, the Monogatari's, all those shows, they're on Hulu also.

129
00:08:24,846 --> 00:08:26,770
Speaker 1: So what the fuck do I need Crunchyroll for?

130
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:27,989
Speaker 1: Is Yurikuma in there?

131
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:28,361
Speaker 1: Yes.

132
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:29,989
Speaker 0: Lupin Fujikomine?

133
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:30,611
Speaker 1: Yes.

134
00:08:31,253 --> 00:08:37,429
Speaker 1: Every Funimation show is on there, as well as every series of slayers from original to revolution.

135
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:42,530
Speaker 0: Whoa, so I can give all those slayers' DVDs back to Lara, and I can cancel my Funimation account.

136
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:43,051
Speaker 1: Yes.

137
00:08:43,572 --> 00:08:48,061
Speaker 1: Every single, almost every anime that you probably give a shit about watching is on there.

138
00:08:48,662 --> 00:08:50,446
Speaker 1: Samurai Champloo is on there.

139
00:08:50,466 --> 00:08:51,468
Speaker 1: Everything is on there.

140
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:54,510
Speaker 0: Is Ergo Proxy on there?

141
00:08:54,711 --> 00:08:55,309
Speaker 1: Yes, it is.

142
00:08:55,651 --> 00:09:04,070
Speaker 0: Whoa, we should watch that show because we got one episode away from the episode that Daryl Surratt sold me on finishing the show with, the game show episode.

143
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:06,961
Speaker 1: There's so many, I mean, not every show ever is on there.

144
00:09:07,122 --> 00:09:09,050
Speaker 1: Evangelion is not on there.

145
00:09:09,192 --> 00:09:09,983
Speaker 0: Ah, yeah, that's fine.

146
00:09:10,004 --> 00:09:10,389
Speaker 0: I have DVDs.

147
00:09:10,812 --> 00:09:11,536
Speaker 1: Trigun is.

148
00:09:11,737 --> 00:09:12,481
Speaker 1: So is the movie.

149
00:09:12,521 --> 00:09:14,150
Speaker 1: There's a ton of anime movies on there.

150
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:18,270
Speaker 0: Whoa, right, the Trigun movie that we were excited about and then literally never watched.

151
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:20,115
Speaker 1: There are so many animes.

152
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:23,044
Speaker 1: Every episode of Sailor Moon is still going strong.

153
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:24,930
Speaker 1: I mean, they're eventually going to finish it, right?

154
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:29,621
Speaker 1: There is so many animes on there, you don't need another anime service.

155
00:09:30,123 --> 00:09:32,830
Speaker 1: It's better than Crunchyroll, and it's not even anime specific.

156
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,210
Speaker 0: You know what this means, anime nerds.

157
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,070
Speaker 1: Not even, and this doesn't even count the not animes on Hulu.

158
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,775
Speaker 0: Anime is mainstream.

159
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:43,730
Speaker 0: Anime specific internet streaming services do not need to exist in the long run.

160
00:09:43,770 --> 00:09:46,778
Speaker 1: Right, but anyway, so everything is on there.

161
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:48,403
Speaker 1: Cancel whatever else you're using.

162
00:09:48,443 --> 00:09:49,666
Speaker 1: Pay for the ad-free Hulu.

163
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:51,110
Speaker 1: Watch your South Park and your animes.

164
00:09:52,272 --> 00:09:55,190
Speaker 1: And in fact, I'm going to review an anime tonight that I saw on there.

165
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:56,313
Speaker 0: Here's the only question.

166
00:09:56,854 --> 00:10:01,890
Speaker 0: Will the end game for Hulu now be prices go up or ads come in anyway?

167
00:10:02,271 --> 00:10:02,696
Speaker 1: I don't know.

168
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:03,930
Speaker 1: If ads come in anyway, I'll cancel it.

169
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:06,718
Speaker 1: The price going up depends on how much the price is.

170
00:10:07,179 --> 00:10:11,010
Speaker 1: One other thing though, Hulu does separate the sub shows and the dub shows.

171
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:15,579
Speaker 1: There are some shows on there where they do not have the sub.

172
00:10:15,619 --> 00:10:18,767
Speaker 1: For example, Utena is on there with no sub.

173
00:10:18,988 --> 00:10:19,750
Speaker 1: The only dub.

174
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,510
Speaker 0: Do not watch the Utena dub.

175
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:27,050
Speaker 1: Even Captain Tyler is on there, but I don't think there's a sub on there.

176
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:28,408
Speaker 0: I didn't know there was a dub.

177
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:30,019
Speaker 1: Well, I don't know.

178
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:31,170
Speaker 1: Captain Tyler is on there.

179
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:32,308
Speaker 1: There's a Captain Tyler dub?

180
00:10:32,693 --> 00:10:33,145
Speaker 1: I think so.

181
00:10:34,332 --> 00:10:35,519
Speaker 0: I'll check it again.

182
00:10:35,619 --> 00:10:37,450
Speaker 1: I only browse through cursorily.

183
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:40,370
Speaker 0: When I first watched Captain Tyler on VHS, there wasn't a dub.

184
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,270
Speaker 0: I actually wanted to get a dub because I thought my parents would like the show.

185
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:44,256
Speaker 0: There wasn't one.

186
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:45,449
Speaker 0: At least one that I could find.

187
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:47,549
Speaker 0: But in the pre-internet days, it's on Coast.

188
00:10:50,494 --> 00:10:51,610
Speaker 1: There's a lot of fucking shit on there.

189
00:10:51,710 --> 00:10:52,292
Speaker 0: Little news here.

190
00:10:52,312 --> 00:10:53,417
Speaker 0: From 2002 to 2015, Manglobe existed.

191
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,729
Speaker 0: An animation studio that made anime you might have heard of.

192
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:02,810
Speaker 0: And the news recently was that they went bankrupt.

193
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,670
Speaker 1: Well, if you look, it's like they didn't necessarily make bad shows.

194
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:09,490
Speaker 1: They just made unpopular shows and they made them relatively well.

195
00:11:09,631 --> 00:11:11,330
Speaker 1: So it must have cost a lot to make those shows.

196
00:11:11,430 --> 00:11:13,010
Speaker 1: And they didn't make a lot of money from those shows.

197
00:11:13,552 --> 00:11:15,410
Speaker 1: So it's no surprise that they're bankrupt.

198
00:11:15,751 --> 00:11:18,629
Speaker 1: The surprise is that they were able to make as many shows as they did.

199
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:24,064
Speaker 0: When I heard from Anime World Order that Manglobe went bankrupt, at first I thought, "Wow, really?

200
00:11:24,144 --> 00:11:24,628
Speaker 0: They were really

201
00:11:24,648 --> 00:11:24,830
Speaker 0: good.".

202
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,469
Speaker 0: But then I tried to think back of what they did.

203
00:11:27,811 --> 00:11:31,090
Speaker 1: I had to look up a list of what they did because I never really knew who they were.

204
00:11:31,690 --> 00:11:34,030
Speaker 0: Everything that I knew off the top of my head was super old.

205
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:37,747
Speaker 0: And I didn't know they were responsible for anything.

206
00:11:37,787 --> 00:11:42,250
Speaker 0: they've done pretty much since 2009.

207
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,650
Speaker 1: Cool name though, Manglobe.

208
00:11:44,693 --> 00:11:45,524
Speaker 0: What if it's Manglobe?

209
00:11:47,032 --> 00:11:47,316
Speaker 1: I don't know.

210
00:11:47,336 --> 00:11:48,328
Speaker 1: That's cool too.

211
00:11:50,212 --> 00:11:51,530
Speaker 1: I got a lobe, Mang.

212
00:11:51,751 --> 00:11:51,811
Speaker 1: If

213
00:11:51,832 --> 00:12:09,507
Speaker 0: you look at the list of stuff they did, I'm not talking about real money made or anything, but in terms of what the average anime fan, have they heard of the show and do they know anything about it, in America especially, it's pretty much a linear graph down from things people all heard of to things no one's heard of.

214
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:13,548
Speaker 0: I mean, Ergo Proxy was widely known even if people didn't watch it.

215
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,968
Speaker 0: Mijiko and Hachi and a lot of people were really excited about Samurai Champloo.

216
00:12:17,470 --> 00:12:20,592
Speaker 0: A lot of people call that Cowboy Bebop 2.

217
00:12:20,592 --> 00:12:24,409
Speaker 0: And yeah, Gangsta was probably the most recent thing any of you paid attention to.

218
00:12:25,755 --> 00:12:26,567
Speaker 0: And I guess they're gone now.

219
00:12:26,933 --> 00:12:27,465
Speaker 0: Bye bye.

220
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:32,688
Speaker 0: It appears that they might have been insolvent for "some

221
00:12:32,769 --> 00:12:33,090
Speaker 0: time.".

222
00:12:33,231 --> 00:12:39,050
Speaker 1: How did they make animes while they were... I don't understand how so many companies do this, where they have no money but they somehow keep doing stuff?

223
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:44,430
Speaker 0: Because as a company, you have a credit line that you just draw from for operational expenses.

224
00:12:45,050 --> 00:12:50,130
Speaker 1: Oh, so they're just using credit to pay everyone, and then eventually they can't pay the debt and the debt's due and then they're done.

225
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:56,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have a rolling debt, and as long as you continue to service that debt and have good credit, you can just keep generating more debt and rolling it forward and rolling it forward and rolling it forward.

226
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,150
Speaker 0: You can also get short-term business continuance.

227
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,349
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of shit that can go on.

228
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:02,749
Speaker 1: How can we get some of that?

229
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:09,090
Speaker 0: So what we need to do, I'm not going to say what we need to do because if I say it all out loud, it's just a blueprint for fraud.

230
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:11,470
Speaker 1: Oh, how do we do it the not-fraud way?

231
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:12,879
Speaker 0: Well, it's not really fraud.

232
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:16,149
Speaker 0: It's just you make a company and you invest all your money into it.

233
00:13:16,291 --> 00:13:17,610
Speaker 0: You and I put all our money in a company.

234
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,839
Speaker 1: But then my money could be gone.

235
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,949
Speaker 1: That's why I used to buy groceries.

236
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:21,270
Speaker 0: Our money is in the company.

237
00:13:21,331 --> 00:13:22,009
Speaker 0: I need groceries.

238
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:23,190
Speaker 0: And we pay ourselves...

239
00:13:23,211 --> 00:13:23,868
Speaker 1: I need red to pay red.

240
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,272
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

241
00:13:24,292 --> 00:13:27,050
Speaker 0: So we pay ourselves salary from our own money.

242
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:29,130
Speaker 1: But then I don't have to pay tax again?

243
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:33,287
Speaker 1: I already paid tax to get that money from my boss, and now I got to pay tax again?

244
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,699
Speaker 0: That's the cost of doing business.

245
00:13:34,719 --> 00:13:35,730
Speaker 0: But then, here's what happens.

246
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,918
Speaker 1: I'm paying Social Security twice.

247
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:38,590
Speaker 1: Am I getting more Social Security payout later?

248
00:13:38,812 --> 00:13:39,630
Speaker 0: This is a company.

249
00:13:39,650 --> 00:13:40,529
Speaker 1: When I'm an old man?

250
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:48,370
Speaker 0: So then you get at least a few other people, or maybe one other person, to invest in the company and give you a bunch of operating capital.

251
00:13:49,431 --> 00:14:02,610
Speaker 0: Then you use that operating capital and your business plan to get lots of loans and run off the loans, and you pay yourself salary, and eventually you've paid yourself more salary than you put into the company.

252
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:10,830
Speaker 0: And if the company does fail, basically it was all free money because the company goes out of business, you don't get sued.

253
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,268
Speaker 1: They don't come after my anything?

254
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:16,869
Speaker 0: Limited liability, corporation, that kind of thing.

255
00:14:17,772 --> 00:14:21,229
Speaker 0: Those things fundamentally make a firewall between your money...

256
00:14:22,114 --> 00:14:25,210
Speaker 1: The people who lose out then are the investors, who basically just gave me money.

257
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:28,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, the investors and the creditors lose out when a company like that fails.

258
00:14:29,470 --> 00:14:34,409
Speaker 0: Though sometimes they turn it around... Because if the company actually did anything, and that happens...

259
00:14:34,632 --> 00:14:35,350
Speaker 1: They own all that stuff.

260
00:14:35,570 --> 00:14:41,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, one of those people could flip it to someone who's willing to take a risk, and they'll usually pay them enough to make it to where they at least broke even.

261
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,530
Speaker 1: So anything we actually did, like make an anime, now becomes someone else's property.

262
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:48,690
Speaker 1: So we lose all the things that belong to the business.

263
00:14:48,770 --> 00:14:52,169
Speaker 1: Like if we bought computers with those loan monies to work with...

264
00:14:52,270 --> 00:14:52,929
Speaker 0: Those all go away.

265
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:53,890
Speaker 1: We lose all our computers.

266
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,930
Speaker 0: But if I buy a computer with the salary I was paid by the company, I keep that because that's mine.

267
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:01,830
Speaker 0: So yeah, we should start a company maybe.

268
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,189
Speaker 0: I hope no one who would ever invest in us just listen to this.

269
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:06,189
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

270
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:10,490
Speaker 1: I guess that's the part that is the problem.

271
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,448
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, and one last thing.

272
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:13,430
Speaker 0: Date Naito.

273
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:17,149
Speaker 0: We have another game, and it's a cute little game.

274
00:15:18,113 --> 00:15:22,030
Speaker 0: It's original IP from the people inside Date Naito.

275
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:23,490
Speaker 0: This is Lindsay Wood's game, basically.

276
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:25,166
Speaker 1: A non-licensed game, whoa!

277
00:15:25,790 --> 00:15:38,650
Speaker 0: Hustle Cat is about... It's a dating game where you work basically at a magical cat cafe, and there are cute cat boys and cat girls that are actually... Think Wolf's Rain, like cat and person.

278
00:15:39,311 --> 00:15:40,123
Speaker 1: So it's not like...

279
00:15:40,734 --> 00:15:41,490
Speaker 0: It's not Furries.

280
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:42,769
Speaker 1: It's not Nekomimi.

281
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:43,970
Speaker 1: It's not Hataful Boyfriend?

282
00:15:45,117 --> 00:15:45,629
Speaker 0: It's check it out.

283
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:48,550
Speaker 0: Here's the cat version of Mason, and here's the Mason version of Mason.

284
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:50,150
Speaker 1: So does he actually transform into a cat?

285
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,350
Speaker 1: Or is it just a fursona?

286
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,090
Speaker 0: There's some magic and magical secrets, so I'm not going to spoil that.

287
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,449
Speaker 1: Is it a fursona or not?

288
00:15:57,832 --> 00:15:58,668
Speaker 0: It's not a fursona.

289
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:06,549
Speaker 0: But this is a cheap little game that I'm pretty sure a lot of the listeners of Geek Nights will be really into.

290
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:08,330
Speaker 0: Because it's that kind of... You know what it is?

291
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,449
Speaker 0: It is an ideal game.

292
00:16:15,864 --> 00:16:16,759
Speaker 0: Things of the Day.

293
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:18,540
Speaker 0: I have the tiniest, cutest thing of the day.

294
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:25,557
Speaker 0: So someone realized, if you take every iteration of Snorlax and all the mainline Pokemon games, it took him 17 years to wake up.

295
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:32,000
Speaker 0: Because if you put them all in a line, it is a very slow animation of him slowly getting up.

296
00:16:32,421 --> 00:16:34,479
Speaker 0: And in 2014, he is standing and awake.

297
00:16:35,660 --> 00:16:39,240
Speaker 0: He literally is laying on his bag, and he kind of rolls on his side and falls over.

298
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:40,840
Speaker 0: Rolls on his side again, falls over.

299
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,020
Speaker 0: Then he kicks his arms up, and eventually he sits up and he scratches his mouth.

300
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:48,738
Speaker 0: Then he sits there, then he scratches his belly, then his arms are in the air, and then he stands up.

301
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,900
Speaker 1: Well, someone took a long time to play that song on the Poke Flute.

302
00:16:55,322 --> 00:16:57,278
Speaker 0: Well, they were using a Nintendo Wii controller to do it.

303
00:16:59,042 --> 00:17:00,720
Speaker 1: So, this is a kid named Murray.

304
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:01,398
Speaker 1: Murray?

305
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:01,806
Speaker 1: Murray.

306
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:12,960
Speaker 1: And a long time ago, when Murray was still a kid, he was on this TV show as the, you know, take the guest from the audience to participate in a magic trick that was on TV.

307
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,880
Speaker 1: This magician was doing a card trick on British English television.

308
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:23,779
Speaker 1: And Murray comes out of the crowd, or maybe he was prepared in advance to come and, you know, be the, you know, the audience participant, right?

309
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:31,600
Speaker 1: And, you know, the guy doing the magic trick, he's like, "Hey, you know, I got three cards here," right?

310
00:17:31,801 --> 00:17:33,007
Speaker 1: And Murray's like, "No, there's not.

311
00:17:33,047 --> 00:17:33,570
Speaker 1: There's four.

312
00:17:33,590 --> 00:17:34,395
Speaker 1: There's two of them stuck

313
00:17:34,435 --> 00:17:34,837
Speaker 1: together.".

314
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:39,220
Speaker 1: And he just ruins the guy's trick, right?

315
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:56,480
Speaker 1: So, basically, here's a video of many, many, many, many years later, recently, this magician, who had his TV appearance ruined by the kid Murray, is, of course, reunited with Murray as an adult.

316
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,239
Speaker 0: This sounds delightful.

317
00:17:58,821 --> 00:17:58,963
Speaker 1: Yeah.

318
00:17:59,247 --> 00:17:59,957
Speaker 1: So, there you go.

319
00:18:01,321 --> 00:18:09,060
Speaker 0: I think the pro mode in magic tricks is to have the obvious way someone would do it, that they can reveal it, and you have another thing that's going on.

320
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:16,020
Speaker 1: The thing is, he redoes the trick with a different method, and you can, like, you don't even have to be good at magic to see the method that is used.

321
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:21,200
Speaker 1: If you can't tell the method that is used now, that's really sad.

322
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,740
Speaker 0: Well, not everyone's Penn and Teller with their close-up magic.

323
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:33,036
Speaker 1: I mean, sometimes Penn and Teller have that show where it's like they try to fool them or whatever, and a lot of times I'm like, "Hmm, I know it was something with that box, but I don't know

324
00:18:33,117 --> 00:18:33,277
Speaker 1: what.".

325
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:38,680
Speaker 1: This is like, you can just see if you're watching the video exactly and doing everything.

326
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:41,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, because when I saw their show, like, I've seen their shit, like, forever.

327
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:43,860
Speaker 0: Like, I know almost every one of their, like, acts and everything.

328
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:53,917
Speaker 0: I saw them with my mom in Vegas not that long ago, and despite them doing a trick that I 100%, I was 100% sure I figured out, at least like you, like, "Ah, it's something with that

329
00:18:53,998 --> 00:18:54,480
Speaker 0: vase.".

330
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,390
Speaker 0: Like, they're doing something, and then it got me.

331
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:58,362
Speaker 0: It actually got me 100%.

332
00:18:58,362 --> 00:18:59,251
Speaker 0: I was so wrong.

333
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:00,060
Speaker 0: It was ridiculous.

334
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:00,740
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

335
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,595
Speaker 0: Because they do the thing where they're like, "Oh, by the way, here's what we

336
00:19:02,616 --> 00:19:02,757
Speaker 0: did.".

337
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,252
Speaker 1: There's actually a forum the magician's talking.

338
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:06,640
Speaker 1: It's called, like, Genie or something.

339
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,160
Speaker 0: Do you got to prove you're a magician to get in there?

340
00:19:08,341 --> 00:19:14,460
Speaker 1: No, that's the thing is, like, they talk about how all these tricks are done, and they're super anti-revealing tricks, but it's public forum.

341
00:19:14,961 --> 00:19:18,179
Speaker 1: You can go in there and see how many tricks are done.

342
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,380
Speaker 1: So, if you can, I forget where the forum is, but if you find it, you can learn a lot if you care about learning magic.

343
00:19:25,060 --> 00:19:28,100
Speaker 0: In the meantime, the Book Club book was The Wheel of Time book one.

344
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:29,579
Speaker 1: Next, The Square of Time.

345
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:31,640
Speaker 1: The Square of Space.

346
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:36,560
Speaker 0: Well, I'm on the fourth side of time at this point, because I'm most of the way done with the fourth book.

347
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,340
Speaker 1: I'm, like, 90% done with the fourth book.

348
00:19:40,461 --> 00:19:42,109
Speaker 0: I'm about as into it as I was.

349
00:19:42,129 --> 00:19:44,120
Speaker 0: Just keep plodding along.

350
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:54,480
Speaker 0: I don't know if I could have been into these books if they were coming out slowly, but because they go in a very-- If you had to wait for the next one and you forgot the previous one, like, say, a Prince of Nothing situation.

351
00:19:54,800 --> 00:20:09,980
Speaker 0: I'm going to reread all the Prince of Nothing books leading up to when the next one comes out, because I recently, I pulled out one of the old books, because I had an e-book of it, and I went to, like, a random page, and I started flipping through it, and then I ended up reading, like, four chapters before I realized what I was doing, and I had to stop.

352
00:20:10,201 --> 00:20:13,219
Speaker 1: Dat Emperor taking some shortest paths across the step.

353
00:20:14,023 --> 00:20:14,311
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

354
00:20:14,620 --> 00:20:15,239
Speaker 1: The step be trackless.

355
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,920
Speaker 0: Trackless steps.

356
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:19,480
Speaker 0: Defects of the womb.

357
00:20:21,860 --> 00:20:26,880
Speaker 0: I don't think a lot of people realize I'm referencing something when I call some fault to have a defect of the womb, but I digress.

358
00:20:28,081 --> 00:20:35,240
Speaker 0: So, since there's a problem we've had for a while, partly because we've been busy, that Scott and I are watching completely different sets of media.

359
00:20:35,702 --> 00:20:37,219
Speaker 1: Do we have any more meta moments besides that?

360
00:20:37,544 --> 00:20:38,079
Speaker 0: Do we have any more?

361
00:20:39,187 --> 00:20:39,536
Speaker 1: I guess not.

362
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:40,640
Speaker 0: The next con is Magfest.

363
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,100
Speaker 1: The New York Comic Con is this week, and it won't be there.

364
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,027
Speaker 0: No, fuck that.

365
00:20:44,310 --> 00:20:45,359
Speaker 0: New York Comic Con is boring.

366
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:46,037
Speaker 1: Okay.

367
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:47,138
Speaker 0: Like, it's not worth going to.

368
00:20:49,141 --> 00:20:51,374
Speaker 0: Even if you live here and have a free ticket, it's not worth going to.

369
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,320
Speaker 0: Like, I'm not even joking.

370
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:55,940
Speaker 1: You have to have a really sad weekend, and maybe you really want to buy a comic book.

371
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,320
Speaker 0: The only thing is, you can at least take the subway there now.

372
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:01,520
Speaker 1: Is there even a guest there that you want to see?

373
00:21:01,881 --> 00:21:02,885
Speaker 0: I can't think of a guest there.

374
00:21:02,925 --> 00:21:06,320
Speaker 0: I would want to see that I couldn't either just e-mail or see at a smaller con.

375
00:21:06,883 --> 00:21:07,760
Speaker 1: Not this year, anyway.

376
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:07,908
Speaker 0: Yeah.

377
00:21:08,962 --> 00:21:11,400
Speaker 0: I remember one year, I met Gabe and Tycho there.

378
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:13,020
Speaker 1: Was it Makoto Shinkai there?

379
00:21:13,541 --> 00:21:14,083
Speaker 0: He was, yeah.

380
00:21:14,103 --> 00:21:18,720
Speaker 0: In fact, remember, we were the only people who videoed his interview because no press showed up to it.

381
00:21:19,721 --> 00:21:20,759
Speaker 1: A lot of people showed up to it.

382
00:21:20,941 --> 00:21:21,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, but no press.

383
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:25,160
Speaker 0: Remember, I stood in the corner with the cameraman, videoing the whole thing.

384
00:21:25,725 --> 00:21:27,280
Speaker 1: That movie was not his greatest work.

385
00:21:27,660 --> 00:21:28,654
Speaker 0: No, no, it was not his...

386
00:21:29,248 --> 00:21:29,539
Speaker 1: Anyway.

387
00:21:29,961 --> 00:21:31,999
Speaker 0: I like Place Promised, I think, the most.

388
00:21:32,542 --> 00:21:33,998
Speaker 1: I like Hoshi no Koi the most.

389
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,307
Speaker 0: I like Hoshi no Koi a lot.

390
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,454
Speaker 0: Hoshi no Koi made me cry.

391
00:21:36,475 --> 00:21:36,777
Speaker 0: A lot.

392
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,660
Speaker 1: That was what made him famous.

393
00:21:40,343 --> 00:21:41,760
Speaker 1: Since then, he's just drawn clouds.

394
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,960
Speaker 1: That was his follow-up, was making Leeron draw clouds.

395
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:49,020
Speaker 0: Well, it's like the butts that ruined Ghost in the Shell.

396
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,020
Speaker 0: But yeah, I'm watching a whole bunch of animation.

397
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:54,920
Speaker 0: Scott's watching a whole bunch of animation.

398
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:56,300
Speaker 0: We're not watching the same animation.

399
00:21:57,381 --> 00:21:59,379
Speaker 1: No, Rim likes all these garbage Cartoon Network things.

400
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, these great Cartoon Network things.

401
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,155
Speaker 0: I mean, Steven Universe...

402
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,339
Speaker 1: That's not garbage, but I just haven't watched it.

403
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:09,600
Speaker 0: Of all the things I've talked about, because I've been watching... Gravity Falls, that's okay.

404
00:22:10,301 --> 00:22:11,419
Speaker 0: My Little Pony picked up again.

405
00:22:11,601 --> 00:22:13,920
Speaker 1: Did you get to the end of season two of Gravity Falls?

406
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,340
Speaker 1: No, I started season two.

407
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,659
Speaker 1: That's why you only think it's okay.

408
00:22:17,782 --> 00:22:21,820
Speaker 0: The thing is, season one, as a whole, even with Triangle Guy, was okay.

409
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:27,020
Speaker 0: I found I only watched Gravity Falls when I was out of all those other shows.

410
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:35,560
Speaker 1: If I would have made Gravity Falls, I would have had what happens at the end of season two and what happened at the end of episode five, to make it like a cowboy bebop episode five.

411
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:38,320
Speaker 1: And that would have made the show great from the beginning.

412
00:22:40,141 --> 00:22:43,480
Speaker 1: It's sort of like a Gao Gai Gar problem, where it gets good.

413
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:48,360
Speaker 1: But it's good, and then it gets great too late, which is better than Gao Gai Gar.

414
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,720
Speaker 0: Most of the episodes of the first season are basically...

415
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,520
Speaker 1: One-off, random cartoon episodes that have nothing to do with the plot.

416
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're funny, but they don't have to be plot.

417
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:06,020
Speaker 0: But any Adventure Time episode has more humor in it, even the serious ones, than the average Gravity Falls episode.

418
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:08,339
Speaker 0: And Adventure Time crams that into not that many minutes.

419
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:11,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like the Adventure Time humor more than the Gravity Falls humor.

420
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, because Gravity Falls humor is kind of generic.

421
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,116
Speaker 0: A lot of it's like...

422
00:23:14,642 --> 00:23:18,059
Speaker 1: I'll take a choose goose over anything Gravity Falls has.

423
00:23:19,265 --> 00:23:20,380
Speaker 0: I prefer the choose Bruce.

424
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:29,678
Speaker 0: But yeah, so now that Rick and Morty finished the second season, I feel comfortable actually, for real, reviewing it.

425
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,560
Speaker 0: And Scott and Emily watched Colorful while I was in Australia.

426
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:34,827
Speaker 1: Which was a movie.

427
00:23:34,867 --> 00:23:39,860
Speaker 1: We went on Hulu, because he wanted to watch something, and then he said, "Wow, I have Hulu now, and there's a bunch of stuff on there.

428
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:42,060
Speaker 1: Let's browse through the movie section," which is amazing.

429
00:23:42,221 --> 00:23:45,140
Speaker 1: And I found an anime movie that looked good that I never saw, called Colorful.

430
00:23:46,021 --> 00:23:48,040
Speaker 1: And Emily said she read the book, so we watched the movie.

431
00:23:48,341 --> 00:23:48,797
Speaker 0: So how was it?

432
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:51,171
Speaker 1: So Colorful is based on this book.

433
00:23:51,392 --> 00:23:52,579
Speaker 1: I forget who the author's name is.

434
00:23:54,143 --> 00:23:54,668
Speaker 0: It's your review.

435
00:23:54,688 --> 00:23:55,959
Speaker 0: I thought you could have all the info up.

436
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:56,586
Speaker 0: I'll pull up A&N.

437
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:01,300
Speaker 1: No, apparently it's a very popular and prolific Japanese novelist.

438
00:24:03,844 --> 00:24:06,319
Speaker 1: And this anime movie is... I liked it.

439
00:24:06,941 --> 00:24:10,380
Speaker 1: And it's good, but it's not for everybody, and it has issues.

440
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:14,079
Speaker 1: So the story, basically, is there's a soul.

441
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,816
Speaker 1: And it starts off in some sort of purgatory heaven kind of place.

442
00:24:18,857 --> 00:24:19,540
Speaker 1: you can't really tell.

443
00:24:20,122 --> 00:24:23,597
Speaker 1: But it's a grey place with people's souls lined up.

444
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,060
Speaker 1: And the camera's first person, so you can only see what the soul is seeing.

445
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:32,680
Speaker 1: And the soul's gonna go get in the line to go to the checkout window with the other souls.

446
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,140
Speaker 0: Oh, the plot summary says train station to death.

447
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,167
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, sure.

448
00:24:37,187 --> 00:24:38,380
Speaker 1: It's a train station to death, whatever.

449
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:44,290
Speaker 1: And this character comes up, who's a very anime character, and is like, "Whoa, don't get in that line.

450
00:24:44,330 --> 00:24:45,617
Speaker 1: You've won the lottery, baby.

451
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:46,240
Speaker 1: Yeah!".

452
00:24:46,563 --> 00:24:47,999
Speaker 0: Yeah, already that sounds like a scam.

453
00:24:48,784 --> 00:24:50,757
Speaker 1: So if I'm in line to get a train ticket and someone's like,

454
00:24:50,777 --> 00:24:51,018
Speaker 1: "Hey!"

455
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:56,500
Speaker 1: He's like, "Listen, you've got another chance at coming back to life and redeeming your soul and everything.

456
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:59,420
Speaker 1: You've just gotta go back and live this life.

457
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:06,160
Speaker 1: And if you can live the life well, like a test for a little while, then your soul will go back into resurrection rotation.

458
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,831
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you're in deep doo-doo.

459
00:25:09,851 --> 00:25:12,079
Speaker 1: You're not gonna get to go back to the world of living

460
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:12,300
Speaker 1: again.".

461
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:15,760
Speaker 1: And the soul doesn't really care that much, but eventually it agrees.

462
00:25:16,702 --> 00:25:24,670
Speaker 1: And the soul wakes up in this body of this kid who you know nothing about the kid, because the soul doesn't know, right?

463
00:25:24,791 --> 00:25:25,760
Speaker 1: It's this kid who died.

464
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,300
Speaker 1: But basically this kid killed himself, or tried to, right?

465
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:39,420
Speaker 1: And now this soul, with no memory of any previous lives, is now in this body and has to learn about the kid's past and learn about the kid.

466
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:40,786
Speaker 1: He knows nothing about the kid.

467
00:25:40,846 --> 00:25:43,680
Speaker 1: He doesn't even know his name or anything.

468
00:25:44,963 --> 00:25:51,660
Speaker 1: And has to somehow navigate so many days of life in the living world to redeem itself.

469
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:56,619
Speaker 1: So it's a pretty interesting setup and story going on there.

470
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,418
Speaker 1: You've got movie quality animation going on.

471
00:26:00,881 --> 00:26:05,320
Speaker 1: The thing that's off about this movie is that it's long.

472
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,378
Speaker 1: Like, it's just long.

473
00:26:08,401 --> 00:26:09,980
Speaker 0: It's over two hours.

474
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,694
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is my kind of style.

475
00:26:11,754 --> 00:26:12,440
Speaker 1: Something long.

476
00:26:12,561 --> 00:26:14,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, you like Space Train.

477
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:16,300
Speaker 1: Right, it's a lot like that.

478
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,600
Speaker 1: Except even for me, it felt long because there's parts where it's just not progressing.

479
00:26:22,861 --> 00:26:27,180
Speaker 0: You mean like when the cat in Night on the Galactic Railroad very slowly walks up to the door.

480
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:29,260
Speaker 1: It's progressing artistically and visually.

481
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,094
Speaker 0: Very slowly turns the doorknob.

482
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:32,900
Speaker 0: You get like four minutes.

483
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,919
Speaker 1: This is like he goes to school and nothing new happens at all.

484
00:26:37,462 --> 00:26:41,600
Speaker 1: There's also some parts where it's like you can't really understand why he's doing what he's doing.

485
00:26:41,801 --> 00:26:45,499
Speaker 1: The motivations are a little messed up story-wise and things like that.

486
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,959
Speaker 1: But it comes around in the end.

487
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:50,360
Speaker 1: You know, I think if it had been tightened up a bit.

488
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:54,019
Speaker 1: It's almost like I haven't read the original novel, so I don't know.

489
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:59,500
Speaker 1: But it feels like they actually just animated every single chapter in the whole novel.

490
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:01,959
Speaker 1: And that's why it is the way it is.

491
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:06,540
Speaker 0: Imagine if The Wheel of Time had a movie or TV series that did that.

492
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,540
Speaker 1: Exactly, but actually stuff happens in every chapter of Wheel of Time.

493
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:11,760
Speaker 1: At least people talking in an inn or something.

494
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's a lot of...

495
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,140
Speaker 1: And coming to some important decision while talking.

496
00:27:17,060 --> 00:27:23,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's also a lot of... You're going to get a long slow pan around every fucking common room and every inn.

497
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,023
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

498
00:27:24,064 --> 00:27:26,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, to cover like the two pages of in description.

499
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, lots of names.

500
00:27:28,028 --> 00:27:28,914
Speaker 0: You're going to need like 4,000 actors.

501
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:34,953
Speaker 1: Yeah, and how are you going to... People don't necessarily say their names, so you're going to have to change dialogue.

502
00:27:34,993 --> 00:27:36,600
Speaker 1: so people call out people's names a lot.

503
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:40,680
Speaker 0: Yep, and you know the people who like The Wheel of Time would not be happy if you missed even one of those.

504
00:27:41,281 --> 00:28:01,820
Speaker 1: Anyway, so... But yeah, so if you want a serious but quality anime movie that has a lot of... It discusses a lot of serious topics like suicide, families, Japanese school, testing, all kinds of things like that.

505
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:04,189
Speaker 1: Then this is worth watching.

506
00:28:04,249 --> 00:28:06,260
Speaker 1: Maybe fast forward through some boring bits.

507
00:28:06,442 --> 00:28:07,520
Speaker 0: It's actually interesting because...

508
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:08,680
Speaker 1: Life and death.

509
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:13,514
Speaker 0: A big chunk of that core plot is very similar to Haibane Renmei.

510
00:28:13,534 --> 00:28:15,500
Speaker 0: Did you ever watch that?

511
00:28:15,841 --> 00:28:17,360
Speaker 1: I watched some episodes at the beginning.

512
00:28:17,981 --> 00:28:19,409
Speaker 0: You didn't watch it all the way through.

513
00:28:19,429 --> 00:28:21,199
Speaker 0: You don't know what it's... It's about the same thing.

514
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:40,199
Speaker 0: It's actually... It's got a really good end, but like Colorful, according to you at least... I've not seen it, but Haibane Renmei is beautiful and atmospheric and slice of life, but also about these kinds of issues is... Is also intolerably slow and long at some points.

515
00:28:41,660 --> 00:28:45,360
Speaker 0: I still liked it, but I feel like they might be cut from the same cloth.

516
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:49,339
Speaker 0: I feel like people who have seen both will see an app comparison between the two.

517
00:28:50,040 --> 00:29:03,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, also Colorful has a few different plot threads, and while the main plot thread resolves nicely and as you would expect it does... There are a few plot threads with different characters, like other kids in the school and things like that, that resolve in ways that are at least confusing to me.

518
00:29:03,841 --> 00:29:06,599
Speaker 1: And I felt like that's how you're wrapping that up.

519
00:29:09,882 --> 00:29:16,360
Speaker 1: The main character, the soul, you're sort of on its side until later, and then you're sort of not.

520
00:29:16,801 --> 00:29:21,438
Speaker 1: And then I guess the movie expects you to forgive it, but I didn't.

521
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,242
Speaker 0: Uh-oh.

522
00:29:22,484 --> 00:29:24,159
Speaker 0: Look at you being judgmental.

523
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:26,418
Speaker 1: You'll see if you ever watch it.

524
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,818
Speaker 0: Alright, I'll watch it because I got to see it.

525
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:30,220
Speaker 1: If you got three hours to kill.

526
00:29:31,141 --> 00:29:36,060
Speaker 1: Basically, it was long to the point at which I felt like it was over soon, and then we would press the button to see it.

527
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:37,375
Speaker 1: And they're like, "Only two-thirds over?

528
00:29:37,435 --> 00:29:37,618
Speaker 0: What?".

529
00:29:38,682 --> 00:29:47,978
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm not going to tell the story now, but I had an experience like that with an independent film that I saw with Emily and Phil and Jie and Providence at a film festival that...

530
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,255
Speaker 1: You couldn't leave because it was...

531
00:29:49,681 --> 00:29:52,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I was sitting in the front row and the creators were in the audience.

532
00:29:53,600 --> 00:30:00,515
Speaker 0: But all I will say is there was a point where it had gone on for so long that I was 100% sure it was about to end.

533
00:30:03,340 --> 00:30:05,600
Speaker 0: That was less than a third of the way through the movie.

534
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:07,249
Speaker 1: Whoa.

535
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,019
Speaker 1: How long was this?

536
00:30:08,584 --> 00:30:09,499
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

537
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:10,660
Speaker 1: What was the actual length?

538
00:30:10,901 --> 00:30:12,032
Speaker 0: I don't know.

539
00:30:12,153 --> 00:30:12,718
Speaker 0: Time stopped.

540
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:13,740
Speaker 1: Well, you can't look it up on the IMDb.

541
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,038
Speaker 0: I could, but I'm not going to right now.

542
00:30:16,122 --> 00:30:19,419
Speaker 0: I don't know if I even want to tell people, but don't see that movie.

543
00:30:20,161 --> 00:30:20,342
Speaker 1: Great.

544
00:30:20,402 --> 00:30:21,689
Speaker 1: Now I don't know which movie not to see.

545
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,277
Speaker 1: Someone that's out there is going to see it and they're going to be like, "If you would have only told me, I could have

546
00:30:25,318 --> 00:30:25,540
Speaker 1: avoided.".

547
00:30:27,823 --> 00:30:28,688
Speaker 0: I don't even want to get into it.

548
00:30:28,768 --> 00:30:30,640
Speaker 0: That movie, that was the experience that I had.

549
00:30:30,761 --> 00:30:31,299
Speaker 1: Was it at least good?

550
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,651
Speaker 1: It could be good and ridiculously long.

551
00:30:35,556 --> 00:30:36,220
Speaker 1: I'm guessing not.

552
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:41,680
Speaker 0: There is like three meta perspectives away from my experience.

553
00:30:42,201 --> 00:30:50,740
Speaker 0: There is a person, place, and time that could appreciate that movie and come away with anything that could be said diplomatically.

554
00:30:52,721 --> 00:30:54,526
Speaker 0: It wasn't bad necessarily.

555
00:30:54,546 --> 00:30:56,692
Speaker 0: It was artistic.

556
00:30:56,712 --> 00:30:57,996
Speaker 0: You know what it is?

557
00:30:58,297 --> 00:30:59,480
Speaker 0: It was outsider cinema.

558
00:31:00,104 --> 00:31:01,279
Speaker 0: That's how I'm going to describe it.

559
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:06,515
Speaker 0: The guys who made the movie recently in the interview at the end, "We've never made a movie.

560
00:31:06,535 --> 00:31:08,000
Speaker 0: We don't know shit about making movies.

561
00:31:08,121 --> 00:31:10,396
Speaker 0: I work a vineyard and we just wanted to make a

562
00:31:10,436 --> 00:31:10,799
Speaker 0: movie.".

563
00:31:11,781 --> 00:31:12,919
Speaker 1: Why don't we make a movie like that?

564
00:31:13,985 --> 00:31:14,398
Speaker 0: We should.

565
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,363
Speaker 0: We have cameras.

566
00:31:15,383 --> 00:31:18,918
Speaker 1: Just point them at stuff and then cut all the footage together for 90 minutes and be like,

567
00:31:18,958 --> 00:31:19,139
Speaker 1: "Done.".

568
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:23,313
Speaker 0: 90% of the footage is close-ups of people's faces exerting themselves.

569
00:31:23,835 --> 00:31:25,240
Speaker 0: So yeah, we could make that movie.

570
00:31:25,501 --> 00:31:26,679
Speaker 1: Why did you choose to see this?

571
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:32,534
Speaker 0: I thought it was a collection of Scandinavian and Nordic shorts.

572
00:31:32,915 --> 00:31:34,860
Speaker 0: Short films, like one to five minutes.

573
00:31:35,423 --> 00:31:38,860
Speaker 0: This was listed at the end of a long list of shorts, but it was not short.

574
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:39,521
Speaker 0: No.

575
00:31:39,541 --> 00:31:42,340
Speaker 1: You could have watched all the shorts and then just left.

576
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,825
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was too late.

577
00:31:44,107 --> 00:31:46,580
Speaker 0: I thought it was a short and then it ended.

578
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,360
Speaker 0: Then it turns out that short was just in the movie that never ended.

579
00:31:53,126 --> 00:31:53,720
Speaker 0: So Rick and Morty.

580
00:31:56,321 --> 00:31:59,540
Speaker 1: You keep talking an old Jewish man voice a lot, or at least trying to.

581
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:00,163
Speaker 1: Rick and Morty.

582
00:32:00,526 --> 00:32:01,653
Speaker 0: He's not an old Jewish man.

583
00:32:01,694 --> 00:32:02,559
Speaker 0: He's not Jewish at all.

584
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:05,287
Speaker 0: He's just drunk.

585
00:32:05,307 --> 00:32:09,700
Speaker 0: So Rick and Morty is a recent show, if you have not seen it.

586
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,117
Speaker 1: I've seen pictures of title cards where there's a scientist-looking dude and a kid.

587
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:18,828
Speaker 0: Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon.

588
00:32:18,869 --> 00:32:26,180
Speaker 0: It is based on a thing that you should not watch, because it is just terrible, called The Adventures of Doc and Marty.

589
00:32:27,141 --> 00:32:27,858
Speaker 1: I've never heard of that.

590
00:32:28,101 --> 00:32:28,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a short.

591
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:29,708
Speaker 0: You know what?

592
00:32:30,291 --> 00:32:32,160
Speaker 0: It's in the vein of seeing a ghost.

593
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:34,640
Speaker 1: Is that a Back to the Future thing?

594
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:48,280
Speaker 0: Yes, it is basically Doc Brown and Marty McFly, except Doc Brown is probably a creepy pedophile or hebophile, and all his answers to the things they need to do involve tricking Marty into sucking his dick.

595
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:58,809
Speaker 1: So somebody made a Back to the Future sex parody, and someone then turned that into a not Back to the Future not sex parody.

596
00:32:58,829 --> 00:33:00,820
Speaker 1: Is that what this is?

597
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:10,980
Speaker 0: So Harmon called Doc and Marty a bastardization, a pornographic vandalization of Back to the Future.

598
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:11,726
Speaker 1: That is correct.

599
00:33:11,786 --> 00:33:13,420
Speaker 1: That sounds exactly like what it is.

600
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:15,399
Speaker 0: It's in the genre of One Time I Saw a Ghost.

601
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:17,032
Speaker 1: Yes.

602
00:33:17,235 --> 00:33:17,599
Speaker 1: Sounds good.

603
00:33:18,442 --> 00:33:22,920
Speaker 0: But elements of it were moderately funny, and these guys are pretty funny dudes.

604
00:33:23,382 --> 00:33:27,360
Speaker 0: So long story short, they got an option to then make a show like that.

605
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:31,220
Speaker 1: So they made something awful, and they got an option to make something like the awful thing, only not awful?

606
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:38,260
Speaker 1: So a reverse Ren and Stimpy, where you started with the bad one and then got pulled back in to make the good one.

607
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,223
Speaker 1: It is exactly.

608
00:33:39,384 --> 00:33:47,779
Speaker 0: Imagine if new Ren and Stimpy happened, and then Cartoon Network went to Ren and Stimpy and were like, "Yo, if you tone it back a bit, we'll put you on

609
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:47,960
Speaker 0: TV.".

610
00:33:49,482 --> 00:33:50,125
Speaker 0: So it's like that.

611
00:33:50,667 --> 00:33:52,855
Speaker 0: And the show is great in that regard.

612
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:57,060
Speaker 0: The actual show, Rick and Morty, it seems like it's going to be an episodic.

613
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,338
Speaker 0: Do they have a time traveling car?

614
00:34:00,361 --> 00:34:02,788
Speaker 0: They don't really time travel, but they have.

615
00:34:03,049 --> 00:34:07,945
Speaker 0: basically the doc comes back home to live with his family that he'd abandoned for a long time.

616
00:34:07,965 --> 00:34:11,259
Speaker 0: So like his children and their children and all that.

617
00:34:12,141 --> 00:34:12,659
Speaker 1: You had children?

618
00:34:13,284 --> 00:34:13,433
Speaker 0: Yeah.

619
00:34:15,123 --> 00:34:17,139
Speaker 1: So they're really throwing the Back to the Future out the window.

620
00:34:17,301 --> 00:34:18,003
Speaker 0: Yeah.

621
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:20,833
Speaker 0: Rick and Morty, vague scientist stuff.

622
00:34:20,873 --> 00:34:22,620
Speaker 0: That's about as close of a link as you get.

623
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,819
Speaker 0: Oh, and there's an older guy and a younger guy who team up.

624
00:34:25,601 --> 00:34:29,139
Speaker 0: That is literally as close as you get to Doc Brown and Marty McFly.

625
00:34:30,219 --> 00:34:35,460
Speaker 0: But basically, he is the smartest human being, maybe the smartest thing in the universe.

626
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,179
Speaker 1: I thought you said it was far away from Back to the Future, but still sounds a lot like Back to the Future.

627
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:39,849
Speaker 0: Doc Brown wasn't that smart.

628
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:40,659
Speaker 0: He fucked up a lot of things.

629
00:34:40,742 --> 00:34:41,458
Speaker 1: So you say?

630
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,080
Speaker 0: And he's also a complete asshole and alcoholic.

631
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:46,846
Speaker 0: Okay.

632
00:34:46,866 --> 00:34:48,460
Speaker 1: So it still sounds like Back to the Future.

633
00:34:49,101 --> 00:34:50,492
Speaker 0: I don't think he was much of an asshole.

634
00:34:50,552 --> 00:34:51,580
Speaker 0: I don't think he was an alcoholic.

635
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,900
Speaker 0: And he definitely didn't want oral sex.

636
00:34:56,040 --> 00:35:01,400
Speaker 0: And Morty is his pretty dumb and meek grandson.

637
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:02,899
Speaker 1: Still sounds like Back to the Future.

638
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:08,100
Speaker 0: And they end up going on adventures, but it starts completely in media res, doesn't explain shit.

639
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,720
Speaker 1: So like all these other Cartoon Network shows.

640
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:20,639
Speaker 0: Except, unlike what you would expect from a show like this, it's really funny if you like that sort of pornographic vandalization humor, but it also has a really...

641
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,539
Speaker 1: But it's toned down.

642
00:35:22,161 --> 00:35:24,460
Speaker 1: It's not seeing a ghost, it's just smelling a ghost.

643
00:35:24,941 --> 00:35:26,177
Speaker 0: It is on the level...

644
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,519
Speaker 1: Hearing a ghost in the other room.

645
00:35:27,921 --> 00:35:31,960
Speaker 0: It is one step beyond old Ren and Stimpy on that absolute scale.

646
00:35:32,682 --> 00:35:36,600
Speaker 0: One step worse or better, depending on your perspective, than Ren and Stimpy.

647
00:35:37,482 --> 00:35:47,840
Speaker 0: It's a lot more violent and callous, but at the same time, it's a show that has a surprising depth of characters.

648
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:50,700
Speaker 0: Every character grows rapidly.

649
00:35:52,123 --> 00:35:55,780
Speaker 0: It kind of is a parody of these kinds of shows, but it doesn't reset itself.

650
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,060
Speaker 0: Consequences happen.

651
00:35:57,580 --> 00:36:01,400
Speaker 0: And a few episodes later, you realize the world of the show has changed substantially.

652
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,900
Speaker 0: And it gets poignant, serious, real.

653
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:09,699
Speaker 0: And it is surprising how much this show affected me watching it.

654
00:36:10,282 --> 00:36:17,560
Speaker 0: You would not expect, watching the first few episodes of the show, to have a real and deep emotional attachment to these characters.

655
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:27,560
Speaker 0: And yet, everyone I know who has watched this show the entire first season, and they're short seasons, they're like a few episodes, it's a great show.

656
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,840
Speaker 1: How many total episodes are there?

657
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:31,420
Speaker 0: There are 21 total across two seasons.

658
00:36:31,981 --> 00:36:32,760
Speaker 1: Alright, that's not too bad.

659
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a really short show, you can just bang through it.

660
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:40,199
Speaker 0: But the end of season two, now that it's kind of out, I'm going to say straight up, this is a great show.

661
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:51,579
Speaker 0: And I actually think the only people who should not watch Rick and Morty, if you are actually seriously triggered by really callous violence, and occasionally extremely...

662
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,799
Speaker 1: How do you watch anything on TV?

663
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:56,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, but particularly, don't watch Rick and Morty.

664
00:36:57,401 --> 00:37:04,580
Speaker 0: If you are bothered by those things, but otherwise can watch stuff, there are two episodes of Rick and Morty to skip.

665
00:37:04,781 --> 00:37:06,134
Speaker 1: I have this thing called Ebola syndrome.

666
00:37:06,154 --> 00:37:06,679
Speaker 1: you should watch.

667
00:37:10,162 --> 00:37:16,298
Speaker 0: You know, Ebola syndrome was more enjoyable than that independent thing I was talking about before.

668
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:19,120
Speaker 0: Because Ebola syndrome, the whole time was me going...

669
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,560
Speaker 1: You never thought about getting up and walking out of Ebola syndrome, did you?

670
00:37:22,083 --> 00:37:23,620
Speaker 0: I did, actually, at one point.

671
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:26,680
Speaker 0: I was very close to getting up and walking out at one point.

672
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:32,940
Speaker 0: I stayed to the end out of, I don't know, deep morbid curiosity if it could get any worse.

673
00:37:33,843 --> 00:37:35,940
Speaker 0: And it was worth it for the last three seconds of that film.

674
00:37:36,607 --> 00:37:37,780
Speaker 0: The last three seconds of that film.

675
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:38,719
Speaker 1: The rat on the street.

676
00:37:39,141 --> 00:37:40,320
Speaker 0: No, the rat was a little bit poor then.

677
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:46,359
Speaker 0: When the guy wins, the end of the movie is just the guy with the gun just runs up and just kind of bang, bang, bang, and shoots the guy dead at the end.

678
00:37:48,081 --> 00:37:52,000
Speaker 0: Anyway, but Rick and Morty is really, really, really good.

679
00:37:52,642 --> 00:38:04,280
Speaker 0: It has real characters, it deals with real issues, and I actually find it incredibly funny, and I cannot name a similar show with a similar aesthetic and brand of humor.

680
00:38:05,484 --> 00:38:07,498
Speaker 0: I can't name anything that I'd compare it to, really.

681
00:38:08,820 --> 00:38:12,120
Speaker 0: So it's worth watching if nothing else, because it's very different from everything that I'm watching.

682
00:38:12,801 --> 00:38:16,180
Speaker 1: If you add up the length of all the episodes together, how long is each episode?

683
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,119
Speaker 0: About 24 minutes, standard TV show.

684
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:20,181
Speaker 1: 24 times 21.

685
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:23,580
Speaker 0: It's 21 episodes, it's shorter than one season of anime to watch the entire thing.

686
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,108
Speaker 1: It's like 400 minutes?

687
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:25,153
Speaker 1: Yeah.

688
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,340
Speaker 1: So it's like watching Colorful twice?

689
00:38:28,166 --> 00:38:28,280
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:38:30,426 --> 00:38:33,160
Speaker 0: I think... I'm not going to say it's better than Colorful.

691
00:38:33,908 --> 00:38:34,899
Speaker 0: That is a road too far.

692
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:42,319
Speaker 0: But I'm watching Rick and Morty, BoJack Horseman, My Little Pony, the new season, Adventure Time, Gravity Falls.

693
00:38:43,942 --> 00:38:45,900
Speaker 1: I'm watching The Man Who Punches Only One Time.

694
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:46,660
Speaker 0: Yep, got that.

695
00:38:48,263 --> 00:38:50,360
Speaker 0: Rick and Morty is near the top of all those.

696
00:38:50,601 --> 00:38:53,000
Speaker 0: I like it more than I like the current season of My Little Pony.

697
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,940
Speaker 1: I haven't watched My Little Pony since a long time ago.

698
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:59,313
Speaker 0: You should, because actually the current episodes are this shy of season three.

699
00:39:01,621 --> 00:39:02,740
Speaker 1: That is not on Hulu.

700
00:39:03,580 --> 00:39:04,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know where that is?

701
00:39:04,829 --> 00:39:06,340
Speaker 0: That's on Torrent Freaks.

702
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,008
Speaker 0: And Kick-Ass Torrents.

703
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:09,400
Speaker 0: It's not even on Pirate Bay.

704
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:10,060
Speaker 0: That's fine.

705
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:12,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Ponies is worth watching right now.

706
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,738
Speaker 0: It's actually way back up there.

707
00:39:15,001 --> 00:39:18,560
Speaker 0: Particularly, there's like three episodes in a row that are basically rarity episodes.

708
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,419
Speaker 1: Three in a row, usually they kept alternating to mix it up.

709
00:39:22,921 --> 00:39:35,320
Speaker 0: After the first few episodes of the season, which were not great, suddenly they started like... One episode literally picks up immediately after the previous episode, like the same scene, and just keeps going with the same characters.

710
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:43,940
Speaker 0: It's just more rarity, and there's like four or five new named characters that keep showing up, and the show's grown up a little bit.

711
00:39:44,021 --> 00:39:44,777
Speaker 1: I don't know any of them.

712
00:39:45,521 --> 00:39:46,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, you will.

713
00:39:46,387 --> 00:39:48,360
Speaker 0: Rarity hired a manager for her second boutique.

714
00:39:48,804 --> 00:39:49,180
Speaker 1: Okay.

715
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:53,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the manager's still in the show, just there, talking to them.

716
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:53,740
Speaker 0: It's weird.

717
00:39:54,882 --> 00:39:56,372
Speaker 0: But yeah, watch Rick and Morty.

718
00:39:56,855 --> 00:39:57,640
Speaker 0: It's really good.

719
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:01,820
Speaker 0: And if you doubt me, at least watch the entire first season.

720
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:14,100
Speaker 0: And if you feel nothing, if you're not moved by that human drama, and it might seem weird that I'm telling you this when you start watching Rick and Morty, especially when he's telling Morty to just shove those seeds way up his butt.

721
00:40:15,602 --> 00:40:17,640
Speaker 0: But seriously, the show is really good.

722
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,080
Speaker 0: It's up there with Bojack Horseman in terms of real human feelings and emotion.

723
00:40:22,663 --> 00:40:25,800
Speaker 0: And also horrific sex and violence jokes.

724
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,959
Speaker 0: All mixed into one weird show.

725
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:30,799
Speaker 1: Rim loves the horrific shit.

726
00:40:32,683 --> 00:40:34,100
Speaker 0: Well, I really like her potato conditions.

727
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:42,470
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

728
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:47,590
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

735
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:36,751
Speaker 0: Potato conditions.

736
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:40,434
Speaker 0: Potato conditions.

737
00:41:48,682 --> 00:41:51,099
Speaker 0: This machine creates potato conditions.

738
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,759
Speaker 1: This is where I make potato conditions.

739
00:41:57,165 --> 00:42:03,140
Speaker 0: The magic and the mystery of potato conditions.

740
00:42:06,580 --> 00:42:08,138
Speaker 0: Little black squash balls.

741
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:09,972
Speaker 0: This machine creates potato conditions.
