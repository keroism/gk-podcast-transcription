1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:11,040
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, October 15th, 2013.

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:11,321
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:14,654
Speaker 0: - I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:16,309
Speaker 1: - And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,436
Speaker 1: Neuroshima Hex.

6
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:19,389
Speaker 1: Neuroshima Hex.

7
00:00:22,143 --> 00:00:23,159
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,601 --> 00:00:30,600
Speaker 1: This weekend I did something I have never done before.

9
00:00:31,281 --> 00:00:33,980
Speaker 1: Our good friends Phil and Jay, we were out for Emily's birthday.

10
00:00:34,741 --> 00:00:41,720
Speaker 1: And we went to an old quarry that was filled in with debris from the Big Dig in Boston.

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,332
Speaker 0: - Oh, interesting.

12
00:00:43,352 --> 00:00:43,516
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

13
00:00:44,222 --> 00:00:45,459
Speaker 1: And I got a bunch of pictures and stuff.

14
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,420
Speaker 1: And we climbed up to the top of this huge rock.

15
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:53,860
Speaker 1: And then we rappelled down after Phil showed us how to tie a bunch of knots into these ropes so we wouldn't die.

16
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:57,360
Speaker 1: And then we spent the rest of the day climbing really high rocks.

17
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:58,732
Speaker 0: - Clearly you didn't die.

18
00:00:58,752 --> 00:00:58,853
Speaker 0: - Yep.

19
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,222
Speaker 1: I have done.

20
00:01:00,303 --> 00:01:04,400
Speaker 1: Emily took quite a fall, but she, you know, the rope system all worked.

21
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:10,120
Speaker 1: She swung out across the rock face and got belayed and hit into a rock and was fine.

22
00:01:10,302 --> 00:01:11,579
Speaker 1: And then was able to get back down.

23
00:01:12,522 --> 00:01:15,660
Speaker 1: And I fell off the mountain a couple of times, but again, ropes saved the day.

24
00:01:16,002 --> 00:01:16,918
Speaker 0: That's what ropes do.

25
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,140
Speaker 0: - I've been-- - And dungeons.

26
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:18,722
Speaker 1: - Ropes.

27
00:01:18,742 --> 00:01:20,320
Speaker 1: - I've been free climbing and bouldering.

28
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,120
Speaker 1: But the thing about those two things is that you climb, but you don't really go that high.

29
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,099
Speaker 1: - 'Cause if you go higher than a certain point-- - You will die.

30
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,606
Speaker 1: - Then you'll fuck up.

31
00:01:27,707 --> 00:01:27,991
Speaker 1: Death.

32
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:28,619
Speaker 0: - Death.

33
00:01:30,366 --> 00:01:33,153
Speaker 1: And I've done all sorts-- There are people who do it without ropes.

34
00:01:33,496 --> 00:01:34,020
Speaker 0: They're crazy.

35
00:01:34,180 --> 00:01:34,442
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

36
00:01:34,462 --> 00:01:35,875
Speaker 0: - They sometimes die, and you know what?

37
00:01:35,915 --> 00:01:36,480
Speaker 0: Sometimes don't.

38
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:41,860
Speaker 1: But I've never done significant climbing in a situation like this, with the rope and everything all set up.

39
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,140
Speaker 1: And the two things I can say about this are that one, rappelling is super fun and super easy.

40
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:52,380
Speaker 1: Two, suddenly knots are not that hard to learn.

41
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:53,265
Speaker 0: - No.

42
00:01:53,285 --> 00:01:58,100
Speaker 0: - When I was a kid-- You think that the British sailors who were experts at knots were smarter than us.

43
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,460
Speaker 1: No, but I realized why I never learned a goddamn knot as a kid, except for the one at the time I choose.

44
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,167
Speaker 0: - You didn't have to.

45
00:02:04,187 --> 00:02:04,895
Speaker 1: - And the square knot.

46
00:02:04,936 --> 00:02:05,320
Speaker 1: Exactly.

47
00:02:05,941 --> 00:02:10,616
Speaker 1: In Cub Scouts, they'd sit me down, and they'd be like, "Alright, this is a sheepshank.

48
00:02:11,037 --> 00:02:11,819
Speaker 1: Here's how to do

49
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:11,920
Speaker 1: it.".

50
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:12,865
Speaker 1: - And I just wouldn't care.

51
00:02:12,885 --> 00:02:15,498
Speaker 0: - If you were on a boat, you would have mastered the knots within half a day.

52
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,919
Speaker 1: But then, we get to the bottom, and Phil hands me a rope, and he's like, "Tie the rope like this, and put it on your thing, or you'll

53
00:02:20,939 --> 00:02:21,160
Speaker 1: die.".

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:21,542
Speaker 1: - Yep.

55
00:02:21,562 --> 00:02:23,657
Speaker 1: - And I was like, "How exactly do I tie

56
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:23,858
Speaker 1: this?".

57
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,325
Speaker 0: - Did I do it right?

58
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:31,360
Speaker 1: - One, two, over and around, stab the guy in the eye, and suddenly I knew exactly how to tie all these in front.

59
00:02:32,461 --> 00:02:34,007
Speaker 1: I also finally learned what B.F.K.

60
00:02:34,027 --> 00:02:37,459
Speaker 1: stands for, because I've heard this before, at the top of like a big...

61
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:38,028
Speaker 0: - Big fucking knot?

62
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:38,540
Speaker 1: - Exactly.

63
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,083
Speaker 1: I just heard the

64
00:02:40,103 --> 00:02:40,425
Speaker 1: B.F.K.,

65
00:02:40,506 --> 00:02:42,720
Speaker 1: and I never really, you know, what are those things you don't think about?

66
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:59,839
Speaker 1: But I also learned that climbing in a situation like this, like not in a gym, where there's just you and a rope, and someone down in the bottom kind of watching you with the other end of the rope to make sure you don't die, it's kind of stressful to do the bottom part, because Emily was climbing, and they taught me how to belay.

67
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:01,549
Speaker 0: - Someone's life is in your hands.

68
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:01,992
Speaker 1: - Exactly.

69
00:03:02,233 --> 00:03:03,180
Speaker 1: I'm holding this rope...

70
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,086
Speaker 0: - Don't fuck up.

71
00:03:04,106 --> 00:03:05,498
Speaker 1: - And periodically...

72
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,644
Speaker 0: - You'll be a murderer.

73
00:03:06,664 --> 00:03:08,673
Speaker 1: - They remind me, "Don't let go with your right hand.

74
00:03:09,034 --> 00:03:10,240
Speaker 1: Don't let go with your right hand.

75
00:03:10,661 --> 00:03:12,327
Speaker 1: Just remember, don't let go with your right

76
00:03:12,367 --> 00:03:12,608
Speaker 1: hand.".

77
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:15,740
Speaker 1: And yeah, I had to not let go with my right hand.

78
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,461
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

79
00:03:16,481 --> 00:03:29,624
Speaker 1: - But climbing, when I've climbed things like this before, there are certain kinds of maneuvers that I would never attempt, because if I did it okay, it'd be fine, but if I did it wrong, I would fall.

80
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:35,420
Speaker 1: But now, those maneuvers were the only way to get up the cliff face.

81
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:37,849
Speaker 0: - But if you fuck up, it's okay.

82
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:38,151
Speaker 1: - Yep.

83
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:40,080
Speaker 1: As long as I trust the person at the bottom.

84
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,943
Speaker 0: - It's all about trust.

85
00:03:41,003 --> 00:03:44,237
Speaker 0: Even if you go to a place, you might think like, "Oh, I'll go to a professional

86
00:03:44,297 --> 00:03:44,659
Speaker 0: place."

87
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:44,880
Speaker 0: Right?

88
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:46,003
Speaker 1: - You gotta trust that guy.

89
00:03:46,023 --> 00:03:47,728
Speaker 0: - You're still trusting that guy.

90
00:03:47,809 --> 00:03:49,855
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, okay, it's a professional place.

91
00:03:49,875 --> 00:03:53,367
Speaker 0: you hired as someone from a company, but you could still fall and die.

92
00:03:53,387 --> 00:03:55,073
Speaker 0: It'll just be a lawsuit afterwards.

93
00:03:55,093 --> 00:03:58,465
Speaker 0: If you go out with your friends who are experts, it's no different.

94
00:03:58,486 --> 00:03:59,851
Speaker 0: You're still trusting that guy.

95
00:03:59,871 --> 00:04:02,280
Speaker 0: There's just no lawsuit potential.

96
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:13,960
Speaker 1: - Well, I had that moment, that realization long ago, when I was in high school and I was in marching band, where I was learning marching stuff from these upperclassmen and the section leaders, and they were kind of responsible for all our business.

97
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:21,007
Speaker 1: And then, when I was a section leader, and I was looking back at these kids, and I realized suddenly, they're looking at me the same way.

98
00:04:21,148 --> 00:04:24,440
Speaker 1: I used to look at me, and I thought that I was an expert.

99
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,940
Speaker 1: But now I'm on the other side, and I realize that I'm the exact same person now that I was then.

100
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:30,721
Speaker 0: - Yes.

101
00:04:30,741 --> 00:04:32,128
Speaker 1: - I am simply on a dais.

102
00:04:32,148 --> 00:04:32,851
Speaker 0: - Yes.

103
00:04:32,871 --> 00:04:34,620
Speaker 1: - Like us, with panels at conventions.

104
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,065
Speaker 0: - Exactly.

105
00:04:36,085 --> 00:04:36,749
Speaker 1: - The moral?

106
00:04:37,132 --> 00:04:38,440
Speaker 1: Just pretend you know what you're doing.

107
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,065
Speaker 0: - One time I went rappelling was in Israel.

108
00:04:41,085 --> 00:04:53,180
Speaker 0: We were at the top of this mountain, and we rappelled down into a cavern that was sort of... It was like a cave near the top of the mountain, and the cave had a hole and went from the top of the mountain and came out the sides.

109
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,920
Speaker 0: You would go down into this thing, and then at the bottom of it, you would go down the side of the mountain, right?

110
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,022
Speaker 0: And it was like,

111
00:04:59,102 --> 00:04:59,464
Speaker 0: "Okay.".

112
00:05:00,186 --> 00:05:04,460
Speaker 0: So we rappelled down into the cave part, and then you just sort of walk out the bottom part.

113
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,275
Speaker 0: You're still not at the bottom of the mountain when you go to that part.

114
00:05:08,677 --> 00:05:09,220
Speaker 0: You're still out.

115
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:20,756
Speaker 0: But yeah, the whole cavern was full of mountain goat shit, which is a lot like tiny, tiny rabbit shit pellets, just like ankle deep and completely filling the cavern 100% everywhere.

116
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,924
Speaker 1: - That's kind of special.

117
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:27,480
Speaker 0: - And there were no mountain goats, but it was mountain goat shit everywhere.

118
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,984
Speaker 1: - That's memorable, I imagine.

119
00:05:31,004 --> 00:05:33,752
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it didn't smell like shit, or squish like shit.

120
00:05:33,852 --> 00:05:36,880
Speaker 0: It was like they might as well have been pebbles, but they were poops.

121
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,080
Speaker 1: - Like, Scott, if you go pick up one of those rabbit pellets, they smell vaguely of hay, if anything.

122
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,042
Speaker 0: - Exactly.

123
00:05:43,203 --> 00:05:45,353
Speaker 0: These smell, I guess, vaguely of mountain hay?

124
00:05:45,433 --> 00:05:46,780
Speaker 0: I don't know what mountain goats eat.

125
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:55,980
Speaker 1: - That's one thing I realized in my young life, was that carnivores' poop smells like death, and omnivores' poop smells like extra death.

126
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,760
Speaker 0: - Oh, vegetarian human poop isn't suddenly, you know, great.

127
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:07,260
Speaker 1: - No, but that's because they are omnivores, even though they aren't eating vegetables, but animals that only eat vegetables, their poop ain't so bad.

128
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,342
Speaker 1: - You can deal with it.

129
00:06:08,382 --> 00:06:09,385
Speaker 1: Cow poop, not so bad.

130
00:06:09,405 --> 00:06:10,749
Speaker 1: Horse poop, not so bad.

131
00:06:10,769 --> 00:06:14,199
Speaker 1: Don't want to run my bike through it, as often is the case, but...

132
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,289
Speaker 0: - I avoid the bottom of Central Park for that reason.

133
00:06:18,309 --> 00:06:19,011
Speaker 0: - Exactly.

134
00:06:19,031 --> 00:06:20,838
Speaker 0: - Even if I don't hit anything, it smells.

135
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:21,380
Speaker 0: And tourists.

136
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:34,140
Speaker 1: - So yeah, just to make fun of the people who really, really care about consoles, I want to point out this little news, might not have gotten noticed, that Sony announced that if you buy the PlayStation 4, and you use Bluetooth headsets, fuck you.

137
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,261
Speaker 1: - Really?

138
00:06:35,281 --> 00:06:36,245
Speaker 1: - No support, done.

139
00:06:36,425 --> 00:06:37,931
Speaker 1: You can't chat with Bluetooth headsets.

140
00:06:37,951 --> 00:06:38,855
Speaker 0: - What?

141
00:06:38,895 --> 00:06:40,200
Speaker 0: Well, you can't on an Xbox either.

142
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,107
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but you could on the previous PlayStation.

143
00:06:42,127 --> 00:06:42,870
Speaker 0: - Alright.

144
00:06:42,890 --> 00:06:45,039
Speaker 1: - Do, if you use a USB headset...

145
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:51,060
Speaker 0: - Listen, when the Super Nintendo came out, no one talked about playing NES games on it or anything like that.

146
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:51,742
Speaker 1: - You want to know why?

147
00:06:51,802 --> 00:06:58,338
Speaker 1: Because that was an era when the vast majority of humans, if they had a gaming console at all, had one.

148
00:06:58,418 --> 00:06:59,120
Speaker 1: They had the NES.

149
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:04,745
Speaker 1: So if they bought an SNES, there was no thought of replacement.

150
00:07:05,145 --> 00:07:07,148
Speaker 1: The idea was, this is a different device.

151
00:07:08,449 --> 00:07:11,652
Speaker 1: The NES era went well into the SNES era.

152
00:07:11,773 --> 00:07:18,480
Speaker 1: A lot of NES games that people remember, that sold very well, came out long after the SNES came out.

153
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:26,076
Speaker 1: And the few, the elite, who also had an old Atari, that was on the black and white TV in the den.

154
00:07:26,657 --> 00:07:27,620
Speaker 1: That was on the other TV.

155
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,289
Speaker 0: - When the N64 came out, no one cared that it didn't play SNES games.

156
00:07:31,309 --> 00:07:35,400
Speaker 1: - Ah, but again, that's backward compatibility with your proprietary bullshit.

157
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,184
Speaker 0: - When the GameCube came out, no one cared.

158
00:07:37,225 --> 00:07:38,508
Speaker 0: it didn't play N64 games.

159
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:41,918
Speaker 0: - But this is a lot like... - When the Wii came out, it actually did play GameCube games.

160
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,385
Speaker 1: - And released a portable console that just didn't take normal headphone inputs.

161
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:47,307
Speaker 1: because fuck you.

162
00:07:48,108 --> 00:07:49,009
Speaker 1: That's what this is like.

163
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:53,957
Speaker 1: It's one thing to turn your back on backward compatibility for your own stuff.

164
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:56,140
Speaker 1: I'm not that mad about that.

165
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:02,474
Speaker 1: But when you turn your back on basic stuff like Bluetooth headset and USB headset...

166
00:08:02,494 --> 00:08:04,960
Speaker 0: - Well, the other guys don't even have it, so what do they have it for?

167
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,082
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so Sony had USB headsets.

168
00:08:07,122 --> 00:08:07,883
Speaker 1: This is what's weird.

169
00:08:08,504 --> 00:08:21,780
Speaker 1: At launch, quote, "USB headsets that work with the PS3, some of which are PS3 branded or Sony branded, won't work with the PS2, but Sony says that there will be a system update to address that problem at some point in the

170
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,180
Speaker 1: future.".

171
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,701
Speaker 1: - Okay.

172
00:08:22,721 --> 00:08:24,505
Speaker 1: - "For Sony branded USB

173
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:24,986
Speaker 1: headsets.".

174
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:25,687
Speaker 0: - Okay.

175
00:08:25,707 --> 00:08:28,673
Speaker 1: - I wonder if they mean USB headsets in general or not.

176
00:08:29,796 --> 00:08:30,818
Speaker 1: It's just kind of weird that...

177
00:08:30,838 --> 00:08:31,680
Speaker 0: - The rig works with Xbox.

178
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:36,830
Speaker 1: - Yes, but the rig, a lot of the ways to make the rig work involve...

179
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:38,333
Speaker 0: - Stupid pass-through cables.

180
00:08:38,354 --> 00:08:39,577
Speaker 1: - Dubious, janky pass-through cables.

181
00:08:39,597 --> 00:08:40,840
Speaker 0: - But I see you're using those right there.

182
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,986
Speaker 1: - Oh, I only used those because they were out.

183
00:08:43,126 --> 00:08:45,032
Speaker 1: I have cables that do that without the pass-through.

184
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,537
Speaker 1: Notice how they're not passing through?

185
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:47,380
Speaker 0: - I noticed that.

186
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:50,445
Speaker 1: - That's just to plug my control room in for the time being.

187
00:08:52,028 --> 00:08:53,772
Speaker 1: But it's interesting that they're dropped.

188
00:08:53,832 --> 00:08:57,940
Speaker 1: It's like, I don't know, it's like if an Apple computer didn't have USB on it anymore because fuck you.

189
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,203
Speaker 0: - Only Thunderbolt?

190
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:00,266
Speaker 1: - Yeah, only Thunderbird.

191
00:09:00,286 --> 00:09:02,172
Speaker 0: - Lightning Bolt, Thunderbird, Thunderbolt.

192
00:09:02,192 --> 00:09:04,018
Speaker 1: - Firebird, Phoenix.

193
00:09:04,038 --> 00:09:04,780
Speaker 0: - Yeah, whatever.

194
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:09,929
Speaker 1: - So, I just want to point out, if you're a PC gamer, USB works fine.

195
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:10,530
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

196
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:11,171
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

197
00:09:11,191 --> 00:09:12,875
Speaker 0: - PC never has these problems.

198
00:09:12,895 --> 00:09:13,497
Speaker 0: - Exactly.

199
00:09:13,777 --> 00:09:14,980
Speaker 1: PC has its own problems.

200
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:27,160
Speaker 0: - So, speaking of backwards compatible, right, what's really dumb is how companies, even, you know, they're not going to have the backwards compatibility, but they'll still sell you old games from the old systems digitally.

201
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,421
Speaker 0: - Virtual console.

202
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,303
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

203
00:09:29,323 --> 00:09:39,160
Speaker 0: - But for some reason, it's like, okay, the virtual console would be a good excuse to just never use an emulator ever if you had every game ever on there at a reasonable price.

204
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,363
Speaker 0: Well, forget the prices.

205
00:09:40,384 --> 00:09:45,920
Speaker 0: You know, they obviously don't have every game ever, and a lot of times it's for rights reasons or things like that.

206
00:09:46,420 --> 00:09:51,531
Speaker 1: - Other factors, for example, I like the ability to have save states and to fuck around with the ROMs.

207
00:09:51,551 --> 00:09:55,379
Speaker 0: - Some of the games, some of the virtual console you can just kind of save, sort of.

208
00:09:55,399 --> 00:09:55,800
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

209
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:03,680
Speaker 0: - You know, like, you can just, like, pause a game on the virtual console on the Wii, turn your Wii off, turn it back on, and you'll pick it up right where you left off.

210
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:08,449
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but I want to save a state before that jump.

211
00:10:08,469 --> 00:10:09,551
Speaker 0: - Cheating will not happen.

212
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:13,480
Speaker 1: - Because you know what, I am too old to make that jump in my first three tries.

213
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:21,360
Speaker 0: - So those are the, right, but here's something particularly egregious, right, is when you have a game on the virtual console, and then you take it away.

214
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:40,220
Speaker 0: - On October 11th, they removed this game from Japanese and European virtual consoles, and on October 18th, which is three days from now, Friday, 9am, they don't know what timezone 9am, just 9am, they're gonna remove this game from the US Wii virtual console.

215
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,824
Speaker 1: - And will those people get refunds?

216
00:10:41,844 --> 00:10:45,312
Speaker 0: - No, it's just, if you have it, you still have it.

217
00:10:45,332 --> 00:10:47,136
Speaker 0: - Oh, you can't buy it.

218
00:10:47,156 --> 00:10:48,760
Speaker 0: - Yeah, you can't buy it now.

219
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:57,797
Speaker 0: - But the SNES and Game Boy versions will still be available, they're only removing the NES version for some reason.

220
00:10:57,817 --> 00:10:58,839
Speaker 0: - What game?

221
00:10:58,919 --> 00:10:59,380
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

222
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,665
Speaker 0: - The most important game in the whole virtual console.

223
00:11:01,685 --> 00:11:02,507
Speaker 1: - Mario 3?

224
00:11:02,507 --> 00:11:03,349
Speaker 0: - Yoshi's Cookie.

225
00:11:03,369 --> 00:11:04,632
Speaker 1: - Oh, okay, whatever.

226
00:11:04,652 --> 00:11:07,920
Speaker 1: You know what, let the genocide begin.

227
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,403
Speaker 1: - I don't like Yoshi's Cookie.

228
00:11:10,423 --> 00:11:14,852
Speaker 0: - I'll eat all the cookies before they take them away.

229
00:11:14,872 --> 00:11:15,914
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you know what?

230
00:11:15,935 --> 00:11:18,600
Speaker 0: - Cookie Monster, come help me out here.

231
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:22,144
Speaker 1: - I'm imagining the good cat in response to all this.

232
00:11:22,765 --> 00:11:33,840
Speaker 1: No, seriously though, my surprising, visceral dislike of Yoshi's Cookie aside, because I can kind of articulate why I don't like it, but I don't hate it.

233
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,121
Speaker 1: - You just suck at it.

234
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:36,564
Speaker 0: You don't know how to eat cookies.

235
00:11:36,584 --> 00:11:36,864
Speaker 0: Or bake them.

236
00:11:36,884 --> 00:11:40,870
Speaker 1: - The thing is, when I did play it, I was pretty good at it because it's really easy.

237
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:41,772
Speaker 1: Well, not against you.

238
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:46,819
Speaker 1: Me playing you in that game is like you playing, I don't know, Advance Wars.

239
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,742
Speaker 1: - You're better than me at Dr.

240
00:11:49,782 --> 00:11:50,765
Speaker 1: Mario, too, by far.

241
00:11:50,785 --> 00:11:52,529
Speaker 0: - The difference between me at Dr.

242
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:53,451
Speaker 0: Mario and you at Dr.

243
00:11:53,491 --> 00:11:57,560
Speaker 0: Mario is a wider gap than the gap of you Advance Wars, me Advance Wars.

244
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,422
Speaker 1: - Let's play Advance Wars again.

245
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:02,344
Speaker 1: I seem to recall moments.

246
00:12:02,364 --> 00:12:05,888
Speaker 0: - I'm not saying I'm better, I'm just saying the size of the gap.

247
00:12:05,908 --> 00:12:17,140
Speaker 1: - I posit that the skill cap on Advance Wars is higher, and I further posit that when you accuse me of cheating, because how the fuck do you have units on every city before I get to them?

248
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,165
Speaker 0: - Before I even built one guy on turn one, you have units in every city.

249
00:12:22,185 --> 00:12:22,946
Speaker 0: You're definitely cheating.

250
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:26,771
Speaker 1: - No, just APC chains, man.

251
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,694
Speaker 0: - I also do the APC chains.

252
00:12:28,714 --> 00:12:32,499
Speaker 1: - You do not do it optimally with two APCs, five infantry.

253
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:33,240
Speaker 0: - Anyway.

254
00:12:36,121 --> 00:12:38,364
Speaker 1: Bob, this is kind of bullshit.

255
00:12:38,384 --> 00:12:41,327
Speaker 1: There's a wider case here, there's a wider problem.

256
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:51,540
Speaker 1: They don't want us to do things like emulation and piracy, but simultaneously the official offerings are overpriced, but I would be okay if that was the only problem they had.

257
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:58,290
Speaker 1: They're also less usable, more problematic, more pain in the ass, I can't just play them on my PC.

258
00:12:58,310 --> 00:13:04,860
Speaker 0: - And I'm gonna get some games in the Wii Virtual Console, and some games are in the 3DS Virtual Console.

259
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:10,688
Speaker 1: - And also further, I don't trust them to hold onto the games that I'm playing.

260
00:13:10,708 --> 00:13:11,369
Speaker 1: I don't trust their DRM.

261
00:13:11,389 --> 00:13:14,593
Speaker 0: - You know how much trouble it was when my Wii was stolen to get all my stuff back on my new Wii?

262
00:13:14,613 --> 00:13:15,514
Speaker 0: - I can imagine.

263
00:13:15,534 --> 00:13:16,856
Speaker 0: And also, I own most of these games.

264
00:13:16,876 --> 00:13:19,580
Speaker 0: - It's not like the Xbox, you just log into an account.

265
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:23,444
Speaker 1: - Do you know how many NES games I owned when I was a kid?

266
00:13:23,965 --> 00:13:24,766
Speaker 1: Like,

267
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:25,667
Speaker 1: 80. 80

268
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:26,187
Speaker 1: or 90.

269
00:13:26,187 --> 00:13:29,871
Speaker 0: - Anyway, just more bullshit to put on the pile.

270
00:13:29,891 --> 00:13:30,492
Speaker 1: - Yep.

271
00:13:30,692 --> 00:13:31,093
Speaker 1: You know what?

272
00:13:31,733 --> 00:13:35,898
Speaker 1: I have a ROM of every game from an obsolete console.

273
00:13:35,918 --> 00:13:36,058
Speaker 0: - Ever.

274
00:13:36,078 --> 00:13:37,780
Speaker 0: And the Japanese and European ones.

275
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:39,282
Speaker 1: - Yep, up through the PlayStation 1.

276
00:13:39,282 --> 00:13:44,548
Speaker 1: We're talking Atari's and televisions, MAME cabinets, I've got everything.

277
00:13:44,568 --> 00:13:45,288
Speaker 1: - Everything.

278
00:13:45,509 --> 00:13:45,769
Speaker 0: Ever.

279
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:48,172
Speaker 1: - Except I don't have a good copy of DDR X3.

280
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:55,480
Speaker 0: - The thing is, a lot of it's kind of flaky, so if someone charged me like, 15 bucks a month, I would totally pay.

281
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,121
Speaker 1: - Or, you know what?

282
00:13:56,902 --> 00:14:01,490
Speaker 1: I would pay like a thousand dollars for a perfect copy of what I already have.

283
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,091
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

284
00:14:02,111 --> 00:14:03,013
Speaker 1: - That was just good.

285
00:14:03,033 --> 00:14:04,395
Speaker 0: - All of them were guaranteed to work.

286
00:14:04,415 --> 00:14:05,457
Speaker 1: - Guaranteed to work, and I own them.

287
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:07,100
Speaker 0: - 'Cause a lot of those MAME ones are way flaky, yo.

288
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,761
Speaker 1: - Yeah, MAME is a little worse than other things.

289
00:14:08,781 --> 00:14:11,223
Speaker 0: - And like, FF7 PSX ROM, it crashes.

290
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:12,243
Speaker 1: - Uh, you know what?

291
00:14:12,443 --> 00:14:13,344
Speaker 1: I played FF7.

292
00:14:13,864 --> 00:14:15,525
Speaker 1: I bought the PC version when I was a kid.

293
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:18,247
Speaker 0: - I borrowed the PC version from a friend, and one of the CDs has crashed.

294
00:14:18,267 --> 00:14:18,648
Speaker 0: - You know what?

295
00:14:18,688 --> 00:14:19,608
Speaker 0: That shit crashed.

296
00:14:19,628 --> 00:14:22,410
Speaker 1: - That shit crashed, even without CD scratches.

297
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,392
Speaker 0: - They have it on Steam, I might buy it when it's for like a dollar on Steam.

298
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:29,895
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I never beat Final Fantasy VII, because right when I got to this- - Every time I've ever played it, it crashed.

299
00:14:29,915 --> 00:14:31,997
Speaker 1: - That casino city, like I get there, I leave the city.

300
00:14:32,017 --> 00:14:33,357
Speaker 0: - I don't think I've even gotten that far.

301
00:14:33,377 --> 00:14:35,439
Speaker 0: - And then shit would just crash, and the game would be unbelievable.

302
00:14:35,459 --> 00:14:37,060
Speaker 0: - The farthest I got in one was they were on some tower.

303
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:41,801
Speaker 0: And we beat a guy, and we leapt off the tower on a rope, and it exploded, and then it crashed during the FMV.

304
00:14:41,821 --> 00:14:43,602
Speaker 1: - You didn't get very far.

305
00:14:43,862 --> 00:14:45,543
Speaker 1: That's disc one of the PC one.

306
00:14:45,563 --> 00:14:46,243
Speaker 0: - I think so.

307
00:14:46,263 --> 00:14:52,565
Speaker 1: - And in fact, once the game kept crashing, I was like, "Fuck it," and I went onto the CD, and I found all these AVI files and started watching them.

308
00:14:53,725 --> 00:14:54,725
Speaker 1: Maybe they're MOVs.

309
00:14:55,005 --> 00:14:57,706
Speaker 1: I can't remember if it was a telecaster or a stratocaster.

310
00:14:57,726 --> 00:14:57,886
Speaker 0: - Sure.

311
00:14:57,906 --> 00:15:05,189
Speaker 1: - But anyway, things of the day.

312
00:15:05,249 --> 00:15:09,990
Speaker 1: So Emily, the other day, she's writing a book, and she needed to do some research.

313
00:15:10,691 --> 00:15:18,099
Speaker 1: And she tweeted something at me, and the way that internet-y couples will have conversations with each other in the same room over Twitter.

314
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:24,686
Speaker 1: She was like, "I need to do research on '40s terrorist tactics and sabotage, but I don't want to be on an NSA

315
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:25,006
Speaker 1: list.".

316
00:15:25,026 --> 00:15:26,147
Speaker 0: - You won't be on an NSA list.

317
00:15:26,167 --> 00:15:28,169
Speaker 1: - Oh no, it was obviously a joke tweet.

318
00:15:28,189 --> 00:15:28,670
Speaker 0: - Obviously.

319
00:15:29,490 --> 00:15:38,317
Speaker 1: - And I suddenly realized that might be a cool thing to research, and I immediately found a treasure trove of YouTube videos.

320
00:15:38,698 --> 00:15:41,860
Speaker 1: So the one I want to link YouTube to, because one, I did not know.

321
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:47,045
Speaker 1: technology like this existed in the '40s, and the fact that this video shows it working is kind of crazy.

322
00:15:47,065 --> 00:15:49,026
Speaker 1: I don't know if this was used.

323
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:53,570
Speaker 1: This is a video, and the linked videos will show you so much more awesome stuff.

324
00:15:54,151 --> 00:16:08,470
Speaker 1: From the era when the US military started to be very experimental and empirical, and they started you taking trains and testing ways to sabotage them, videoing their experiments, and using that to create training videos for our troops.

325
00:16:09,090 --> 00:16:11,413
Speaker 0: - You just smash the rails up and the train falls off.

326
00:16:11,433 --> 00:16:12,294
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you think that.

327
00:16:12,355 --> 00:16:13,456
Speaker 1: Watch some of these videos.

328
00:16:13,656 --> 00:16:19,044
Speaker 1: This one video, they're like, "We're going to use plastic explosive to destroy a 36-inch gap on one

329
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:19,485
Speaker 1: rail.".

330
00:16:19,785 --> 00:16:22,809
Speaker 1: And then they put the train over, and they're like, "Nothing fucking

331
00:16:22,849 --> 00:16:23,270
Speaker 1: happened.".

332
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,452
Speaker 1: "Let's watch it in slow motion and figure out

333
00:16:25,492 --> 00:16:25,833
Speaker 1: why.".

334
00:16:25,853 --> 00:16:27,895
Speaker 0: - The train's just so fucking big.

335
00:16:27,915 --> 00:16:33,422
Speaker 1: - It's kind of hard, unless you know what you're doing, to do it.

336
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:40,710
Speaker 1: And the thing is, they didn't know what they were doing, so they did experiments to figure out the most efficient ways to sabotage and derail trains.

337
00:16:41,651 --> 00:16:43,314
Speaker 0: - It depends on the train, right?

338
00:16:43,334 --> 00:16:44,517
Speaker 1: - Yes, they talk about that.

339
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:50,370
Speaker 1: One of these videos is like, "These experiments are all conducted on this one particular kind of train and train

340
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:50,490
Speaker 1: car.".

341
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:53,375
Speaker 0: - Let's say the train has three wheels, a gap, and three wheels.

342
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:59,226
Speaker 0: You need to make a hole in the rails big enough that the front wheel won't reach the next rail before the...

343
00:16:59,246 --> 00:17:01,290
Speaker 1: - Nope, it's much more complicated than that.

344
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:05,876
Speaker 1: - The funny thing is, they got this one where they fucked the rails.

345
00:17:06,297 --> 00:17:06,897
Speaker 1: Like, they destroyed...

346
00:17:06,917 --> 00:17:08,319
Speaker 0: - Like, twisted sideways and shit?

347
00:17:08,339 --> 00:17:12,146
Speaker 1: - No, they just ripped out huge chunks in this crazy, erratic pattern.

348
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:12,906
Speaker 1: Like, big gaps.

349
00:17:13,186 --> 00:17:14,429
Speaker 1: And the train was like, "Fuck you, I'm a

350
00:17:14,469 --> 00:17:14,790
Speaker 1: train.".

351
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,292
Speaker 0: - It just bounced right over onto the next rail?

352
00:17:17,313 --> 00:17:18,295
Speaker 0: - Pretty much, yeah.

353
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:23,545
Speaker 1: But then they figured it out, and then the final parts of these videos, you see, like, "Oh...".

354
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,967
Speaker 1: And the video is an instructional thing.

355
00:17:24,987 --> 00:17:26,069
Speaker 1: These videos are from the OSS.

356
00:17:26,329 --> 00:17:26,891
Speaker 0: - Mm-hmm.

357
00:17:26,911 --> 00:17:32,001
Speaker 1: - And they're like, "Here is exactly how to sabotage a train with a minimum amount of plastic

358
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:32,261
Speaker 1: explosives.".

359
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:35,347
Speaker 0: - Fuck up the rails on the bridge and just blow up the goddamn bridge.

360
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:35,648
Speaker 0: Boom!

361
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:36,610
Speaker 1: - No, no, not bridges.

362
00:17:36,870 --> 00:17:37,231
Speaker 0: - Train falls in.

363
00:17:37,251 --> 00:17:37,672
Speaker 1: - Not bridges.

364
00:17:37,792 --> 00:17:44,147
Speaker 1: Actually, what I've learned is that the optimal place to cause train sabotage is in tunnels, because you're not gonna destroy the bridge...

365
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,270
Speaker 0: - Cage the tunnel in on the train?

366
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,036
Speaker 1: - And they can just knock the train off the bridge if it's stuck there.

367
00:17:48,357 --> 00:17:53,870
Speaker 1: If you derail a train in a tunnel, it's gonna take them a long goddamn time to get that train out of that tunnel.

368
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,933
Speaker 1: So, the video I'm linking to is the Mole.

369
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:06,959
Speaker 1: The Mole is a device that was designed to derail a train when it went into a tunnel later.

370
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:15,185
Speaker 1: The way it works is it has a really primitive photovoltaic cell, and they show the video of a guy actually setting it up.

371
00:18:15,305 --> 00:18:21,390
Speaker 1: I would be scared shitless to set this up, because the way it works is you stick this thing that has a really strong magnet on it on the train.

372
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,955
Speaker 1: - Then you stick the detonator... - How do you set...

373
00:18:24,256 --> 00:18:29,890
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, to put something on the train, wouldn't they notice when they inspected... The evil Nazis inspect their train, wouldn't they fucking notice it?

374
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:34,730
Speaker 1: - Yeah, it's a tiny thing with a minimal amount of plastic explosive, and they show you exactly where to hide it.

375
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:38,570
Speaker 0: - So you have to get a spy to sneak over to the train and stick it on before it leaves the station.

376
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,656
Speaker 1: - Yeah, well, you can stick it on at any point in its journey.

377
00:18:40,676 --> 00:18:45,430
Speaker 1: You stick it in this one place, and then you put some plastic explosive, an amount that I could carry in my pockets.

378
00:18:46,731 --> 00:18:52,041
Speaker 1: - And you stick a detonator into it, and then you pull a thing off of the front of these photovoltaic cells.

379
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:56,470
Speaker 1: The fact that there is light hitting them prevents the detonator from going off.

380
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:05,170
Speaker 1: - As soon as... If the light suddenly cuts out, not gradually, but if it suddenly cuts out, it explodes like three seconds later.

381
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:10,923
Speaker 1: - So you just stick this on a train, and eventually that train is going into a tunnel, and then ba-boom!

382
00:19:11,404 --> 00:19:13,730
Speaker 1: And it's set up to derail the train perfectly.

383
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:24,390
Speaker 1: - I did not know that this level of sabotage technology existed at that time, and it's kind of cool that this is just a video that our own government put out.

384
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:27,742
Speaker 1: - Like, "Hey guys, need to sabotage a train?

385
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,088
Speaker 1: Here's how to do

386
00:19:29,188 --> 00:19:29,228
Speaker 1: it!".

387
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:37,990
Speaker 1: - So yeah, take this into account if you're ever making a 40s era World War video game where you have to sabotage things.

388
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:42,582
Speaker 0: - Alright, well, Rym is teaching you how to sabotage a train correctly.

389
00:19:42,602 --> 00:19:44,830
Speaker 0: I will teach you how to clean your bathtub.

390
00:19:45,491 --> 00:19:50,745
Speaker 0: - Now, the chore that I have to do that I dislike the most is scrubbing the bathtub, because my arm hurts.

391
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:52,410
Speaker 0: My arms are weak.

392
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:54,287
Speaker 1: - You don't just spray it with something and then...

393
00:19:54,530 --> 00:19:55,630
Speaker 0: - Well, I also gotta scrub it and shit.

394
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:57,134
Speaker 1: - Yeah, not that much.

395
00:19:57,937 --> 00:20:00,830
Speaker 1: If you use one of those daily shower sprays, you don't have to really scrub ever.

396
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:03,529
Speaker 0: - But check it out, somebody figured out a way to do this.

397
00:20:03,730 --> 00:20:05,189
Speaker 1: - Just fill the whole thing with drain out.

398
00:20:05,650 --> 00:20:05,750
Speaker 0: - No.

399
00:20:06,111 --> 00:20:09,218
Speaker 0: How to scrub your bathtub the manly way.

400
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:11,544
Speaker 0: Manly being awesome.

401
00:20:12,145 --> 00:20:14,150
Speaker 0: You get the idea of what's going on here.

402
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:15,460
Speaker 1: - Okay, that's a power drill.

403
00:20:15,702 --> 00:20:16,509
Speaker 1: I see what's going on here.

404
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,372
Speaker 0: - You see what's going on?

405
00:20:17,392 --> 00:20:24,190
Speaker 0: He pretty much attaches the power drill to a bathtub scrapey bit and spins that scrapey bit around hardcore.

406
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:27,209
Speaker 0: - I'm gonna do this, for reals.

407
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:32,490
Speaker 1: - You do it, and if you don't shrapnel yourself in the eye or ruin your tub, I will do the same.

408
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,730
Speaker 0: - Why would I shrapnel myself in the eye?

409
00:20:35,050 --> 00:20:35,394
Speaker 1: - I don't know.

410
00:20:35,434 --> 00:20:36,830
Speaker 1: If it breaks, you spin it too fast.

411
00:20:37,630 --> 00:20:38,190
Speaker 0: - It's unlikely.

412
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,075
Speaker 1: - In about a moment, the book club book is Stazzyland.

413
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:47,570
Speaker 1: The number of books I have read since we started this book club, other than Stazzyland, is now five.

414
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:49,897
Speaker 1: - I'm gonna start working on six.

415
00:20:50,098 --> 00:20:52,550
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna start reading the new Locke Lamora book.

416
00:20:52,730 --> 00:20:57,910
Speaker 0: - I'm just not reading books lately, and it's not in the mood for this non-fiction Stazzyland.

417
00:20:58,370 --> 00:20:58,566
Speaker 0: - Alright.

418
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,870
Speaker 0: - I started reading it, and I wasn't excited, so I lost my motivation.

419
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:02,650
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you...

420
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,288
Speaker 0: - But I'm gonna do it anyway, because I have to.

421
00:21:05,011 --> 00:21:06,725
Speaker 1: - Alright, what are you gonna pick?

422
00:21:06,745 --> 00:21:07,330
Speaker 1: You picked yet?

423
00:21:07,430 --> 00:21:08,150
Speaker 0: - Is that motivating?

424
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:12,510
Speaker 1: - Alright, because the longer you wait, the more painful my next choice will be.

425
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,030
Speaker 1: - Great.

426
00:21:13,370 --> 00:21:18,649
Speaker 1: - Actually, I'll say straight up, I'm debating between, for my next set of books, Watership Down...

427
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:19,503
Speaker 0: - Alright, well...

428
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:21,908
Speaker 1: - The Satanic Versus... - God.

429
00:21:22,350 --> 00:21:22,554
Speaker 1: - What?

430
00:21:22,594 --> 00:21:23,206
Speaker 1: Have you ever read it?

431
00:21:24,090 --> 00:21:24,427
Speaker 1: - Okay.

432
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,069
Speaker 0: - Read a book!

433
00:21:26,170 --> 00:21:26,706
Speaker 0: - Not that book.

434
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:27,854
Speaker 1: - You haven't read that book?

435
00:21:28,135 --> 00:21:29,782
Speaker 1: That famous controversial book?

436
00:21:29,983 --> 00:21:31,690
Speaker 1: The one that many people have died over?

437
00:21:31,910 --> 00:21:32,250
Speaker 1: - Sure.

438
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,510
Speaker 1: - You haven't read that?

439
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,509
Speaker 0: - I guess we should read anarchist cookbook, too.

440
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:36,194
Speaker 1: - I've read that.

441
00:21:36,254 --> 00:21:38,250
Speaker 1: It's kind of boring, and the recipes are wrong.

442
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:38,710
Speaker 0: - Sure.

443
00:21:41,350 --> 00:21:43,057
Speaker 1: - And yeah, we got videos on the internet.

444
00:21:43,158 --> 00:21:45,026
Speaker 1: BurningCon is this weekend.

445
00:21:45,126 --> 00:21:45,990
Speaker 1: We will be there.

446
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:48,850
Speaker 1: Gotta finish my scenario.

447
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:49,340
Speaker 0: - Me too.

448
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,182
Speaker 1: - Like, tonight.

449
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,085
Speaker 1: - Me too.

450
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:52,218
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

451
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:52,943
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

452
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:53,711
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

453
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:58,629
Speaker 1: The thing is, I had the scenario done, but it's my old one, and I know all the problems with it, so I've been redoing it.

454
00:21:59,031 --> 00:22:05,470
Speaker 1: But I think I have beliefs for the dragon, and as long as those beliefs hold up on a second reading, I think I'm good to go.

455
00:22:06,270 --> 00:22:10,570
Speaker 1: That dragon does not want what the players are gonna think it wants, and I think that's gonna be a good thing.

456
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:12,870
Speaker 1: Also, the dragon is actually a spaceship.

457
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,649
Speaker 1: - The dragon does.

458
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:14,203
Speaker 1: - Spoilers.

459
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:15,568
Speaker 0: - The dragon does.

460
00:22:16,510 --> 00:22:18,478
Speaker 0: - Oh, there are meta items.

461
00:22:18,518 --> 00:22:21,610
Speaker 0: There's a crazy Netrunner tournament this weekend in New York City.

462
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:22,413
Speaker 0: In fact, there's two of them.

463
00:22:22,453 --> 00:22:26,210
Speaker 0: It's the Plugged In Tour, which is where Fantasy Flight Games is coming to the city.

464
00:22:26,632 --> 00:22:30,570
Speaker 0: So Saturday at the Strats, Sunday somewhere, the fucking Brooklyn, I don't give a shit about.

465
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:43,470
Speaker 0: I think what it's looking like now, actually, is I'm just gonna stop over there, like Saturday morning, you know, check in, and then go to Burning Con, because the tournament is not being run by the usual people.

466
00:22:43,510 --> 00:22:48,330
Speaker 0: It's being run by the store, and they're probably gonna be mad inefficient, so it's gonna take way too goddamn long.

467
00:22:48,771 --> 00:22:50,034
Speaker 0: So I'm just not gonna enter the tournament.

468
00:22:50,055 --> 00:22:55,130
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna sorta do the Plugged In stuff, and then plug Jack Out, and come over to Burning Con.

469
00:22:55,310 --> 00:22:56,797
Speaker 1: - Gonna Jack Out before you hit that ice.

470
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:59,370
Speaker 1: Ice, five subroutines, be slow.

471
00:22:59,770 --> 00:22:59,902
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

472
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,347
Speaker 0: - Be slow, be slow, mess up the bracket, be slow, and the run.

473
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:09,110
Speaker 0: - The only reason to play in this one is to get these special goodies just for that one.

474
00:23:09,350 --> 00:23:10,181
Speaker 1: - Oh, so now it's schwag.

475
00:23:10,202 --> 00:23:10,830
Speaker 1: is what you care about.

476
00:23:10,990 --> 00:23:17,150
Speaker 0: - No, I'm saying the schwag, not only do I not care about it, I care even less about this schwag, because even if I got that schwag, I would give it away.

477
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,593
Speaker 1: - All right, all right, LinkedIn.

478
00:23:18,613 --> 00:23:23,869
Speaker 1: So I just got an email, and it recommended a job that I should apply for.

479
00:23:25,733 --> 00:23:31,470
Speaker 1: Of all the job recommendations I've ever gotten, so it's the WWE.

480
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:32,470
Speaker 0: - Okay.

481
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,650
Speaker 1: - They want a VP of digital technology.

482
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:36,090
Speaker 0: - I don't know, you could do that.

483
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:37,030
Speaker 1: - For the WWE.

484
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:37,707
Speaker 0: - I could do that.

485
00:23:37,910 --> 00:23:39,196
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you could do that easily.

486
00:23:39,658 --> 00:23:42,550
Speaker 1: In-depth knowledge of TCP/IP and IGMP and DNS.

487
00:23:42,850 --> 00:23:43,548
Speaker 0: - It's in Connecticut, though.

488
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,790
Speaker 1: - Yeah, Stanford, so not doing that.

489
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:47,650
Speaker 1: - Nope.

490
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,257
Speaker 0: - All right, so other meta items.

491
00:23:50,297 --> 00:23:54,230
Speaker 0: So the forum is having some issues, technologically speaking.

492
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:58,459
Speaker 0: The solution we have is to get Vanilla to host it for us, which was basically.

493
00:23:58,479 --> 00:24:03,190
Speaker 0: I have a test forum set up with them as the free trial, and it pretty much solves every problem we have.

494
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:08,479
Speaker 0: The problem is, it is expensive, expensive money.

495
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:14,010
Speaker 0: It's like $150 a month expensive, which is more than the hosting bills we pay now by a lot.

496
00:24:14,190 --> 00:24:31,670
Speaker 1: - Yeah, partly only because the actual audio hosting, despite the kind of ridiculous bandwidth you guys draw, because yeah, we have an X number of listeners who do every episode as it comes out, but we have this kind of weird long tail where episodes from seven years ago will just be downloaded a few times every day.

497
00:24:32,152 --> 00:24:34,790
Speaker 1: And that all adds up a lot, and we pay almost nothing for that hosting.

498
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,190
Speaker 0: - Right.

499
00:24:35,430 --> 00:24:37,989
Speaker 1: - I'm worried that our hosting provider will one day be like, "Yeah, fuck you

500
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:38,090
Speaker 1: guys.".

501
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:39,550
Speaker 0: - Libsyn's been around long enough, I think we're good.

502
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:40,189
Speaker 1: - I think we're good.

503
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:45,190
Speaker 0: - But anyway, yeah, so I don't know where we're gonna get these monies from.

504
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,729
Speaker 1: - We got some ideas, though.

505
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:51,590
Speaker 0: - Yeah, we might have to go to it and then put a donation link on the side of the forum or something.

506
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:53,510
Speaker 0: - There might be other-.

507
00:24:53,510 --> 00:24:59,684
Speaker 0: - And then you'll be able to, anyone who asks to join the forum, sorry, I can't really make it happen right now.

508
00:24:59,724 --> 00:25:01,969
Speaker 0: You'll have to wait until we switch over.

509
00:25:02,550 --> 00:25:05,407
Speaker 1: - You can email us and say hi, just so we can be like,

510
00:25:05,427 --> 00:25:05,688
Speaker 1: "Hey.".

511
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:11,570
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but basically what's gonna happen is I'm pretty sure it's very likely we're gonna do this switchover to the expensive forum now.

512
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:20,290
Speaker 0: And when we do, basically you're gonna have to turn off the regular forum during the switchover, so there's gonna be a no forum time period.

513
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:24,250
Speaker 1: - I also noticed, I don't know if you noticed, but- - Or at least a time period where you can't post or anything.

514
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:28,964
Speaker 1: - It looks like there are not links to the forum.

515
00:25:29,005 --> 00:25:30,069
Speaker 1: discussions from episodes.

516
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,749
Speaker 0: - I thought there were, I thought I fixed that a long time ago.

517
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,809
Speaker 1: - I don't th- no, they're gone.

518
00:25:35,490 --> 00:25:35,651
Speaker 1: - Ugh.

519
00:25:35,671 --> 00:25:36,294
Speaker 1: - Catherine.

520
00:25:36,596 --> 00:25:39,330
Speaker 1: That's why all the new people aren't posting in the forum.

521
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:41,670
Speaker 0: - Well, we can go back and fix that at some point.

522
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:58,050
Speaker 1: - Yeah, so basically stay tuned over the next weeks and months for a bunch of sort of back and stepping up of the Geek Nights game, mostly related to the forum, but some other corporate style things just to get us more on modern footing.

523
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:01,010
Speaker 0: - And the only other convention you have to worry about is MagFest.

524
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:01,921
Speaker 0: - MagFest.

525
00:26:01,941 --> 00:26:02,548
Speaker 1: - New Year's.

526
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:04,051
Speaker 0: - MagFest.

527
00:26:04,071 --> 00:26:14,030
Speaker 0: - No better way in the universe to start off 2014 than to be at MagFest for all four days, 24/7, hotel con with music and games.

528
00:26:14,250 --> 00:26:22,503
Speaker 1: - Different cons have different rims at them, but if you find rim at MagFest in the evening, or perhaps in the early morning- - That is the strongest.

529
00:26:22,543 --> 00:26:23,370
Speaker 0: The strongest rim.

530
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:31,030
Speaker 1: - It is either the rim who's playing his third back-to-back game of Eclipse, or the rim who is drunkenly wandering around the Bimani area.

531
00:26:32,310 --> 00:26:33,096
Speaker 1: - One of those two.

532
00:26:33,116 --> 00:26:34,929
Speaker 1: My full power comes out.

533
00:26:35,170 --> 00:26:39,390
Speaker 0: - Depending on when the Machine Supremacy concert is, it may be a different rim altogether.

534
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:47,870
Speaker 1: - That rim might be moving his chin forward and backward in a rhythm, probably while wearing earplugs, because yeah.

535
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:50,482
Speaker 0: - Is there any other meta we have?

536
00:26:50,543 --> 00:26:51,510
Speaker 0: Let's just wait, whatever.

537
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,316
Speaker 1: - So, I can't believe we haven't done a show about this game, because I play it- - Every day.

538
00:26:56,336 --> 00:26:57,850
Speaker 0: - Every time I poop.

539
00:26:58,070 --> 00:27:01,270
Speaker 0: - This is perhaps the only game I play almost every day.

540
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:12,050
Speaker 1: - This literally is the game to play if you have to take a poop, and you're a male-identified gendered person.

541
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:14,770
Speaker 0: - Why not a female-identified person?

542
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:20,230
Speaker 1: - You could, but in my experience, most of the women I talk to think it's gross that men take so much time pooping.

543
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,039
Speaker 0: - Way to be sexist.

544
00:27:22,221 --> 00:27:25,250
Speaker 0: If you're a person- - That's why I was very careful in my description.

545
00:27:25,551 --> 00:27:29,730
Speaker 1: - If you're a person, a human being- - Who takes about seven to ten minutes to poop.

546
00:27:29,890 --> 00:27:35,850
Speaker 0: - Who poops, and poop comes out your butt, and you have to sit in a toilet for a time period while the poop is coming out.

547
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,170
Speaker 1: - It'll take exactly one game of Nourishima Hexworth.

548
00:27:38,370 --> 00:27:39,737
Speaker 0: - Exactly, you need this game.

549
00:27:40,361 --> 00:27:42,110
Speaker 0: So, Nourishima Hex is originally a board game.

550
00:27:42,330 --> 00:27:45,690
Speaker 1: - Well, it was originally a role-playing game.

551
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:45,816
Speaker 1: - What?

552
00:27:46,810 --> 00:28:00,050
Speaker 1: - Nourishima Hex is a Polish tactical board game based on the Nourishima role-playing game, which I've never- - Published by Wydonicto Portal, which does not have a Wikipedia page.

553
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:07,350
Speaker 0: - Nourishima Hex is a board game that has nothing to do with role-playing, except maybe the theme of it, and it is a great board game.

554
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:11,730
Speaker 1: - It was actually recommended to us by two friends we meet at conventions every year.

555
00:28:11,870 --> 00:28:18,030
Speaker 0: - But the problem with the board game is that the way the game works has this sort of resolution phase, and you will-.

556
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:21,309
Speaker 0: - I imagine playing the board game, unless you're very careful, you will mess it up.

557
00:28:22,050 --> 00:28:29,210
Speaker 0: - And playing the computer video game on your phone means that you can't possibly mess it up, and you can also play against the AI, or your friends.

558
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:34,930
Speaker 1: - Except there's a bug in the Android one, at least last I saw, where if you move an HQ on top of a grenade, it crashes.

559
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,030
Speaker 0: - Oh.

560
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:37,149
Speaker 1: - So you can't do that.

561
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:40,110
Speaker 0: - I did that, and it worked, and my HQ didn't even take damage.

562
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,450
Speaker 1: - It's not supposed to take damage.

563
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:43,549
Speaker 0: - Well, then it did it right, didn't it?

564
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:47,810
Speaker 1: - Yeah, the Android one just crashes if you move your HQ on top of a grenade.

565
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:49,768
Speaker 0: - Go iOS, go iOS, iPhone.

566
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:50,715
Speaker 1: - That's fine.

567
00:28:50,735 --> 00:28:51,625
Speaker 0: Deal with this game.

568
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:53,669
Speaker 0: - Almost actually, no, it was your birthday in July.

569
00:28:53,810 --> 00:29:00,010
Speaker 0: - It was recommended to us, particularly by someone who recognized that there's- - The first time I ever saw it, Pete showed it to me at Connecticut.

570
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:01,252
Speaker 1: - Yup.

571
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,118
Speaker 1: There was an Advance Wars drought in my life.

572
00:29:03,179 --> 00:29:06,330
Speaker 1: I played them all to the end, in the extreme.

573
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:09,730
Speaker 0: - I'm thinking about going back and playing all the Advance Wars, starting with Advance Wars.

574
00:29:10,310 --> 00:29:12,868
Speaker 1: - Yeah, if you're gonna do that, don't forget to play Desert Commander on the NES.

575
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:13,949
Speaker 0: - Ooh, I should.

576
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:16,150
Speaker 1: - Yeah, that game is mad easy.

577
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:20,690
Speaker 0: - Maybe I'll just play Famicom Wars on my Game Boy One emulator.

578
00:29:20,990 --> 00:29:21,100
Speaker 1: - Woo!

579
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:26,468
Speaker 1: - I remember we were trying to play that versus, and we were like, "You can't tell the units

580
00:29:26,529 --> 00:29:26,710
Speaker 1: apart.".

581
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:28,144
Speaker 1: It's like, "Is that a tank or a dude?

582
00:29:28,245 --> 00:29:28,467
Speaker 1: I don't

583
00:29:28,487 --> 00:29:28,709
Speaker 1: know.".

584
00:29:28,830 --> 00:29:29,354
Speaker 0: - I don't know.

585
00:29:29,777 --> 00:29:31,469
Speaker 0: Can you read that Japan moon language?

586
00:29:31,529 --> 00:29:31,650
Speaker 0: Nope.

587
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:42,350
Speaker 1: - So, this game, it was recommended to us as a, not really a replacement for Advance Wars, but that it can scratch a similar itch.

588
00:29:42,490 --> 00:29:44,190
Speaker 0: - It is a turn-based strategy game.

589
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:44,932
Speaker 1: - Yep.

590
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:45,998
Speaker 1: It is a turn-based game.

591
00:29:46,361 --> 00:29:47,930
Speaker 1: that is very simple rules.

592
00:29:48,451 --> 00:29:51,690
Speaker 1: It is an orthogame in the fullest extent of that definition.

593
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:54,270
Speaker 0: - Right, I'm not gonna explain all the rules, but here's the gist.

594
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:58,590
Speaker 0: You've got a hexagonal-shaped board, and you've got hexagonal-shaped pieces.

595
00:29:58,790 --> 00:30:00,510
Speaker 1: - With a radius of five, diameter of five.

596
00:30:00,990 --> 00:30:02,476
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

597
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,628
Speaker 0: On your turn, first thing, everyone has one hex piece.

598
00:30:05,668 --> 00:30:09,470
Speaker 0: that's the base, and the base has 20 hit points, and when it takes 20 damage, you lose.

599
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:09,818
Speaker 0: - Yep.

600
00:30:10,090 --> 00:30:13,570
Speaker 0: - And you wanted to make the other people die by dealing 20 damage to them.

601
00:30:13,930 --> 00:30:15,390
Speaker 0: - Just like Magic the Gathering.

602
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:20,270
Speaker 1: - And you've got a bunch of other tiles that have guys with initiatives and attacks and maybe powers.

603
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:20,451
Speaker 0: - Yep.

604
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:22,021
Speaker 0: And every turn, you get some pieces.

605
00:30:22,062 --> 00:30:23,210
Speaker 0: You can't keep all of them.

606
00:30:23,410 --> 00:30:25,470
Speaker 1: - You get three, discard one, play the other two.

607
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:25,992
Speaker 0: - Yep.

608
00:30:26,113 --> 00:30:27,462
Speaker 0: You don't even have to play the other two.

609
00:30:27,503 --> 00:30:28,530
Speaker 0: You can play like one if you want.

610
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:28,851
Speaker 1: - Yep.

611
00:30:28,871 --> 00:30:30,078
Speaker 1: You can throw the other ones away.

612
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,890
Speaker 1: You can hold onto them and use them on another turn.

613
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:52,290
Speaker 0: - Basically, you play hexes on the board, and then, whenever there's a battle, all the pieces sort of do their thing in initiative order, dealing damage to adjacent pieces or pieces far away, and pieces shoot each other, pieces shoot bases, pieces can net other pieces to prevent them from doing anything, pieces boost other pieces, you know, increase their damage.

614
00:30:52,610 --> 00:30:57,350
Speaker 0: Every different headquarters, every different faction has a different special power, et cetera.

615
00:30:57,390 --> 00:31:15,390
Speaker 0: So it's all about placing your pieces in the right order, triggering battles, moving pieces, et cetera, so that when the battle happens, you deal more damage to the other guy than he does to you, or even if you take more damage, you kill so many of his guys that you're gonna kill him off in the next battle, or whatever.

616
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:16,514
Speaker 0: You don't even have to kill him completely.

617
00:31:16,534 --> 00:31:20,150
Speaker 0: You just have to do more damage than you got dealt over the course of the game.

618
00:31:20,370 --> 00:31:27,630
Speaker 1: - Now, you can idly play this three or four player, but that shit sucks for all the reasons we've talked about in the lectures for the last seven or eight years.

619
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:29,216
Speaker 0: - Two player is the way to go.

620
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:36,330
Speaker 0: Even against the computer, I play this two player, and I think in a recent update, the AI has gotten way, way better.

621
00:31:36,450 --> 00:31:42,070
Speaker 0: I had a period of time where the AI literally could not even beat me, let alone, he couldn't even damage me that much.

622
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:47,710
Speaker 0: Now I'm losing once in a while, and I'm also, because I used to just play blue guy every time.

623
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:50,350
Speaker 1: - Well, because blue guy is the best OP hacks.

624
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,719
Speaker 0: - Yes, now I sort of play random guy against random guy.

625
00:31:53,759 --> 00:31:54,562
Speaker 0: Sometimes I get blue.

626
00:31:55,023 --> 00:31:56,126
Speaker 0: Sometimes I'm against blue.

627
00:31:56,146 --> 00:31:57,350
Speaker 0: Sometimes blue isn't even in there.

628
00:31:57,450 --> 00:31:58,313
Speaker 1: - I only play three colors.

629
00:31:59,175 --> 00:32:03,750
Speaker 1: I've played them all, but I only play blue, though when we play, Scott and I, we both ban blue.

630
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,934
Speaker 1: No blue, because it's too powerful.

631
00:32:05,837 --> 00:32:08,886
Speaker 1: Blue, light purple, or dark purple.

632
00:32:09,508 --> 00:32:10,090
Speaker 1: Those are my three.

633
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:10,913
Speaker 0: - Those are okay.

634
00:32:10,933 --> 00:32:13,329
Speaker 0: - Also, I can consistently beat blue with dark purple.

635
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:20,590
Speaker 0: - I'm trying to get better at using money guy, who takes over the other guy's units, because thematically I like that guy the best.

636
00:32:21,810 --> 00:32:26,290
Speaker 1: - Well, thematically I like light purple, because that's New York City saying fuck you to the rest of the world.

637
00:32:26,290 --> 00:32:26,772
Speaker 0: - That's true.

638
00:32:26,792 --> 00:32:27,675
Speaker 0: That's also a good one.

639
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:29,321
Speaker 0: You're talking about the RPG theme.

640
00:32:29,362 --> 00:32:31,048
Speaker 0: I'm talking about the game mechanic.

641
00:32:31,730 --> 00:32:36,290
Speaker 1: - Technically, those guys are super strong, super resilient, and have a few big distance hitters.

642
00:32:36,810 --> 00:32:44,990
Speaker 0: - Yeah, but the other purple guy just surrounds himself first, so you can't damage him, because all his guys next to his HQ take two damage to kill.

643
00:32:45,110 --> 00:32:45,412
Speaker 0: - Yup.

644
00:32:45,432 --> 00:32:48,209
Speaker 0: - And some of his guys already have armor, so they double their armor.

645
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:49,913
Speaker 1: - Yup, I love that so much.

646
00:32:49,933 --> 00:32:57,410
Speaker 0: - And then after that, he just puts all his guys on you, and every time there's a battle, okay, you damage his guys a little bit, and then he puts some more guys on you.

647
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:00,096
Speaker 1: - But then dark purple is all these guys that shoot twice.

648
00:33:00,136 --> 00:33:00,958
Speaker 1: They have two initiatives.

649
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:02,221
Speaker 1: They shoot out one side.

650
00:33:02,502 --> 00:33:06,030
Speaker 1: They have a reflector out the back that just reflects any damage that comes in that direction.

651
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,699
Speaker 0: - Oh, those guys are jerks, because they can move themselves for free.

652
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,563
Speaker 1: - And they can move!

653
00:33:09,763 --> 00:33:11,389
Speaker 1: So if you put a guy to attack him, they go whoop!

654
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:12,611
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

655
00:33:12,631 --> 00:33:17,230
Speaker 1: - And if you put one of those guys attacking, and you put a damage multiplier on him, shit's fucked.

656
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:27,650
Speaker 0: - The worst is I had a guy, and I was attacking his HQ with big ranged weapons, like double star, double, you know, damages, and it was like gonna do three damage to him twice.

657
00:33:28,510 --> 00:33:33,984
Speaker 0: - He put one of the reflectors there, and it ended up bouncing all that damage.

658
00:33:34,084 --> 00:33:36,530
Speaker 0: The damage doesn't get bounced back to the guy who shot it.

659
00:33:36,570 --> 00:33:39,901
Speaker 1: - Nope, it goes back from the person that has the reflector.

660
00:33:39,922 --> 00:33:42,370
Speaker 0: - So I did six damage to my own HQ, and I just quit.

661
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:44,234
Speaker 1: - I go for that.

662
00:33:44,254 --> 00:33:45,858
Speaker 1: There's two things I go for when I play the game.

663
00:33:45,878 --> 00:33:46,759
Speaker 1: Well, three things I go for.

664
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:51,510
Speaker 1: I go for what's the most ridiculous negative I can get an enemy HQ to.

665
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:52,151
Speaker 1: - Yeah.

666
00:33:52,171 --> 00:33:53,394
Speaker 1: - What's the... what?

667
00:33:54,617 --> 00:34:00,050
Speaker 1: I don't remember what exactly I go for, because I haven't played in a couple days, because my poop's been too short.

668
00:34:00,270 --> 00:34:01,213
Speaker 0: - Uh oh, short poops.

669
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:02,277
Speaker 1: - Yeah, I gotta start pooping longer.

670
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:03,642
Speaker 0: - Eat more.

671
00:34:03,662 --> 00:34:04,164
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

672
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:05,990
Speaker 0: - Eat more nasty food.

673
00:34:06,170 --> 00:34:15,585
Speaker 1: - Oh, I always go for the reflection onto the HQ, or I go for doing something really angering with like Red's Bomb.

674
00:34:16,466 --> 00:34:18,730
Speaker 1: Red's Bomb or any of the weird pieces like that.

675
00:34:19,431 --> 00:34:19,712
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

676
00:34:19,732 --> 00:34:24,306
Speaker 0: The one thing about this game, though, is that no matter how good you are, there is a luck element that can happen.

677
00:34:24,327 --> 00:34:25,350
Speaker 1: - Huge luck element.

678
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:35,150
Speaker 0: - It's like if you just start the game, and your first three pieces are all movement pieces, it's like, well, now you have to throw one of those away, which you kind of wanted later on when it would be really useful, and you don't have any guys to put on the board.

679
00:34:35,770 --> 00:34:40,460
Speaker 0: - And if you try to keep your movement pieces, well, you're gonna only draw one new piece now.

680
00:34:40,481 --> 00:34:44,770
Speaker 1: - Sometimes with blue, I'll get my awesome net guys when there's no way to use them effectively.

681
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:45,030
Speaker 1: - Yeah,

682
00:34:45,050 --> 00:35:05,170
Speaker 0: it'll be like, well, I can't put them right next to his HQ right now, because it's all clogged up, and no matter how many battles there are, it'll stay clogged up, so now I have to use my awesome triple damage net guy, which I only have two of, which are the only way I can win this game, and use him to kill like a nothing out in the middle of nowhere, and hope I get enough movement pieces to move him closer to the HQ later, which will not happen.

683
00:35:06,051 --> 00:35:06,272
Speaker 0: Ever.

684
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:09,181
Speaker 1: - But the game has a nice cascade of that.

685
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:12,310
Speaker 1: you make quick decisions, you know, discard a piece, play two, back and forth, back and forth.

686
00:35:12,531 --> 00:35:15,558
Speaker 0: - Yeah, each turn, you don't make such a small decision.

687
00:35:15,578 --> 00:35:20,470
Speaker 0: that's almost meaningless, like take it to a ride is like, on your turn, it's like you make almost no decisions, it's so small.

688
00:35:20,470 --> 00:35:27,630
Speaker 1: - Yup, the decisions matter a huge amount, every move you make, the slight rotation of a piece matters so much in the end.

689
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,839
Speaker 0: - You make a significant but quick decision each turn.

690
00:35:30,859 --> 00:35:34,730
Speaker 0: that matters a ton, and you take lots and lots of turns going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth.

691
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:41,930
Speaker 1: - And then, periodically, either because you played a battle card, or because the thing filled up, there'll be a big ol' battle, and everything just gets resolved.

692
00:35:41,930 --> 00:35:44,350
Speaker 0: - I love it when the thing doesn't fill up because you have a landmine down.

693
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:47,110
Speaker 1: - Yup, and then the AI will never put something on that landmine.

694
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,207
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and I just wait, I'll just like wait every turn, and be like, "Oh, come

695
00:35:50,247 --> 00:35:50,308
Speaker 0: on.".

696
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:57,830
Speaker 1: - Yup, I will also very often wait just to force the other guy to spark the battle, so I can then move in on his now clear base.

697
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:08,210
Speaker 0: - Another thing is I'll put a landmine next to myself, like in a defensive position, and then, when the time is right, I'll actually use a useless piece to get rid of my own landmine, then put a good piece there for super defense.

698
00:36:08,530 --> 00:36:14,944
Speaker 1: - Or, the classic piece, I feel like the AI, at least on iOS, and Android, is obsessed with doing this.

699
00:36:15,264 --> 00:36:17,770
Speaker 1: If he can bump a guy into a landmine, he'll do it no matter what.

700
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,770
Speaker 0: - Yes, that happens a lot.

701
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:21,555
Speaker 1: - That is his favorite thing to do.

702
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:26,030
Speaker 1: I don't always do it, but he will do it to the exclusion of all other good ideas.

703
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:32,590
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it doesn't seem like it's, it's not like a super intelligent AI, it's just, it's just like... - It's competent.

704
00:36:32,730 --> 00:36:46,330
Speaker 0: - Yeah, it's like, I don't understand, it has certain patterns that follow that are relatively complex, like somebody went in and hard coded in a bunch of rules, right, like, you know, do this, do this, do this, do this, do this, and one of those rules is bump a guy into the landmine.

705
00:36:47,110 --> 00:36:52,870
Speaker 0: - It's definitely not... - Because a human coded, hard coded all these rules, it actually ends up being pretty damn good at the game.

706
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:56,370
Speaker 1: - Yup, there's no way it's adaptive, because the same things always work on it.

707
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:00,710
Speaker 0: - And sometimes, occasionally, it will do something really dumb, you know, for no reason.

708
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:05,770
Speaker 1: - Yup, like, I don't think it quite understands the ramification of reflected damage.

709
00:37:06,130 --> 00:37:10,830
Speaker 0: - No, and the other thing that really ruins me at this game is when I misinterpret what is going to happen.

710
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:13,030
Speaker 1: - Yup, either because I wasn't paying attention.

711
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:15,330
Speaker 0: - Yup, or because I didn't know the rule about something.

712
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:18,727
Speaker 1: - And I never read the rules, I literally just played this game 100% by trial and error.

713
00:37:19,430 --> 00:37:24,810
Speaker 0: - You can keep open, there's an interface you can open that lets you click on, like, any hex, and it will tell you what that piece does.

714
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:34,810
Speaker 0: - And a lot of times, it's like, oh, I didn't realize that guy was absorbing the power, like, for example, there's a guy who absorbs the powers given to by enemy boosts.

715
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,910
Speaker 0: - So if I have a +1 melee... - Oh, I love that guy.

716
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:43,770
Speaker 0: - If I have a +1 melee damage, and he's next to it, he's getting +1 melee damage, and you have to look really carefully to realize that.

717
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:46,355
Speaker 0: - So, you know, that's one thing.

718
00:37:46,756 --> 00:37:50,828
Speaker 0: Did you know that guy absorbs powers from enemy HQs?

719
00:37:50,888 --> 00:37:51,570
Speaker 0: If you put him next...

720
00:37:51,710 --> 00:37:52,349
Speaker 1: - Yes, I knew that.

721
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:56,059
Speaker 0: - If you put him next to the light purple HQ, well, he's got super armor.

722
00:37:56,501 --> 00:38:00,030
Speaker 0: Oh, shit, I did not know that, and I ended up getting fucked by it.

723
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:00,588
Speaker 1: - Yup.

724
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,827
Speaker 0: - He was next to my green HQ, and he attacked again, and I was like, no, what?

725
00:38:06,268 --> 00:38:06,650
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

726
00:38:07,411 --> 00:38:08,170
Speaker 1: - No, that moment.

727
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:13,130
Speaker 0: - Because there is no visual indication of that, you just have to know the rules, and then look and see that.

728
00:38:13,830 --> 00:38:28,130
Speaker 1: - Now, playing this game by trial and error was interesting, because I would often be confronted with situations that made no sense, and then the game almost became, figure out what the rule was with that particular piece, because I didn't understand why what happened happened.

729
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:28,630
Speaker 0: - Yup.

730
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,240
Speaker 0: Or, dang, I would have put that guy there.

731
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:33,750
Speaker 0: I would have used my gun to kill a guy if I would have known.

732
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:36,850
Speaker 1: - And I think it's more fun if you don't read the rules and just try to play the game.

733
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:41,562
Speaker 0: - What's also weird is some of the snipers just kill a guy no matter how much health he has, and some of them.

734
00:38:41,602 --> 00:38:42,846
Speaker 0: it's like, nope, does one damage.

735
00:38:42,926 --> 00:38:44,130
Speaker 0: It's like, how do I know the difference?

736
00:38:44,910 --> 00:38:58,040
Speaker 1: - Though, one thing that I have thought of recently, I accidentally, because I got an Android phone, a new one, and I started playing Nourishima Hex on the subway once, and there was all this music and sound effects that I had never heard before.

737
00:38:59,210 --> 00:38:59,627
Speaker 0: - Oh, wow.

738
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:05,310
Speaker 1: - Because when I first installed the game, I turned off all the sound effects, because I always played it in the bathroom.

739
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:07,609
Speaker 0: - Oh, I just turned the sound down?

740
00:39:08,470 --> 00:39:10,530
Speaker 1: - I don't play games in the bathroom with sound.

741
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,950
Speaker 0: - Yeah, I just, when I go into the bathroom, I just turn the volume down on the phone.

742
00:39:14,150 --> 00:39:17,590
Speaker 1: - But I just leave the volume off, because I only play this game when I'm pooping.

743
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:18,132
Speaker 0: - Okay.

744
00:39:18,654 --> 00:39:22,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the different guys make different noises, like the chainsaw guy goes "ring

745
00:39:22,048 --> 00:39:22,269
Speaker 0: ring!".

746
00:39:22,570 --> 00:39:22,728
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

747
00:39:23,232 --> 00:39:24,920
Speaker 0: - And the gun guy's like "pow pow pow

748
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,286
Speaker 0: pow!".

749
00:39:26,387 --> 00:39:27,070
Speaker 0: It's pretty interesting.

750
00:39:27,390 --> 00:39:31,710
Speaker 1: - What's interesting is I've played as Red, and I find Red really powerful, but I don't like Red.

751
00:39:31,870 --> 00:39:33,690
Speaker 1: - Not only Red is- - I viscerally don't like playing Red.

752
00:39:33,910 --> 00:39:36,890
Speaker 0: - Red might be my least favorite guy to play as or against.

753
00:39:37,110 --> 00:39:41,490
Speaker 1: - Because Yellow's just sad and kind of sucks, but Red is good, and- - Yellow isn't that sad.

754
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:43,316
Speaker 0: - Yeah, Yellow's- - Yellow can do a ton of damage.

755
00:39:43,336 --> 00:39:45,989
Speaker 0: If Yellow has like one good battle, he's just going "yun yun

756
00:39:46,009 --> 00:39:46,109
Speaker 0: yun!".

757
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,016
Speaker 1: - You play Yellow, I'll play any color.

758
00:39:48,277 --> 00:39:48,820
Speaker 1: I'll beat you.

759
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,567
Speaker 1: You deny that Yellow will lose.

760
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:53,129
Speaker 0: - Yellow also has some tricky net guys, too.

761
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,297
Speaker 1: - Yeah, whatever.

762
00:39:54,317 --> 00:39:55,510
Speaker 1: A couple of net guys, they don't do tight damage.

763
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:58,150
Speaker 0: - The guy who has the net on the left and the right with the damage in the middle?

764
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,150
Speaker 1: - Yeah, one damage in the middle, initiative two, what the fuck ever.

765
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:05,387
Speaker 0: - That guy can be really- he'll come in and be like "boom" at the right moment and be like

766
00:40:05,508 --> 00:40:05,708
Speaker 0: "shit.".

767
00:40:06,090 --> 00:40:06,251
Speaker 1: - Yup.

768
00:40:06,814 --> 00:40:09,910
Speaker 1: Better than purple guys, spend a health from the HQ to net anybody.

769
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:11,358
Speaker 0: - That guy's pretty good.

770
00:40:11,378 --> 00:40:12,470
Speaker 0: You know what's really good?

771
00:40:12,610 --> 00:40:15,010
Speaker 0: - Is when that guy you netted got killed and then you can net someone else.

772
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:17,330
Speaker 1: - Exactly, especially if you have the thing that lets you net for free.

773
00:40:17,470 --> 00:40:19,301
Speaker 0: - The thing that lets you net for free, oh my god.

774
00:40:19,321 --> 00:40:20,870
Speaker 0: I just stick that way out somewhere.

775
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,208
Speaker 0: - It's like "yeah, go attack

776
00:40:22,248 --> 00:40:22,350
Speaker 0: that.".

777
00:40:22,370 --> 00:40:22,929
Speaker 0: - Yeah, go kill it.

778
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:24,358
Speaker 0: - We'll waste a guy attacking that thing.

779
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:25,886
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, "oh, I netted

780
00:40:25,906 --> 00:40:26,027
Speaker 0: you.".

781
00:40:26,810 --> 00:40:27,239
Speaker 0: - Yeah, what?

782
00:40:27,525 --> 00:40:27,750
Speaker 0: What?

783
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:33,450
Speaker 1: - Now, despite the extremely high luck component in this game, it's very well balanced.

784
00:40:33,890 --> 00:40:38,545
Speaker 0: - And it's interesting- - If you play enough games, the better player will win all of them.

785
00:40:39,027 --> 00:40:39,530
Speaker 0: Most of them.

786
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:41,601
Speaker 1: - And the golfing skill is pretty high.

787
00:40:41,661 --> 00:40:50,250
Speaker 1: Like, if you play this game- - Like, if Scott or I play this game against someone who's played it maybe 10 or 15 times, - We would crush them automatically.

788
00:40:51,210 --> 00:40:54,370
Speaker 1: - Playing against someone who's never played it before, like, I wouldn't even be trying to win.

789
00:40:54,530 --> 00:40:57,990
Speaker 1: - I'd be trying to, like, not take any damage and bring them down to zero.

790
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:04,870
Speaker 1: - Someone who's played this game, who's pooped a lot, will be incredibly good at this game.

791
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:10,890
Speaker 1: - There is actually a wide gulf of skill before the luck becomes the deciding factor.

792
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:13,970
Speaker 1: - And even then, it's only the deciding factor per game.

793
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:22,369
Speaker 1: - And in the advanced play, like if Scott and I play at this point, there's a lot of the bluff factor, - Because we both have memorized all the tiles.

794
00:41:23,452 --> 00:41:24,215
Speaker 1: - Yep.

795
00:41:24,577 --> 00:41:27,550
Speaker 0: That's the highest level of play that I haven't reached, just because of laziness.

796
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:29,910
Speaker 1: - Well, I've memorized all the tiles of some of the sets.

797
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:33,390
Speaker 0: - Memorize all the tiles, and then count the tiles.

798
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,030
Speaker 0: - Because you see when someone discards a piece.

799
00:41:36,690 --> 00:41:41,455
Speaker 0: - So, you know, you can figure out exactly which tiles they have left in their stack, - And be like, "Aha!

800
00:41:41,898 --> 00:41:43,028
Speaker 0: He doesn't have any net guys

801
00:41:43,069 --> 00:41:43,210
Speaker 0: left!".

802
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:47,129
Speaker 0: - "The only way he can stop this move is if he has a net guy left, which he definitely doesn't

803
00:41:47,169 --> 00:41:47,350
Speaker 0: have.".

804
00:41:47,551 --> 00:41:50,770
Speaker 1: - I do it the same way I do hearts, because usually when I play hearts, I'm playing socially.

805
00:41:50,830 --> 00:41:53,950
Speaker 1: - So I don't maintain a complete and total count in my head.

806
00:41:54,070 --> 00:41:56,630
Speaker 1: - Just because it's not worth the effort unless we're playing for money.

807
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:59,244
Speaker 0: - It's like, "Oh, that set has three reflecting guys, and I've killed two.

808
00:41:59,264 --> 00:41:59,967
Speaker 0: There's only one left.

809
00:42:00,008 --> 00:42:00,128
Speaker 0: I

810
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:00,349
Speaker 0: gotcha.".

811
00:42:00,590 --> 00:42:01,433
Speaker 1: - So I do a soft count.

812
00:42:01,493 --> 00:42:07,829
Speaker 1: I basically remember for each set the number of guys that can fuck up my day, - And I count how many of them I've seen.

813
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:10,950
Speaker 1: - So I know how many guys remain that could fuck up my day.

814
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:14,450
Speaker 1: - Like, purples drop in on top of any guy killing him.

815
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:17,842
Speaker 0: - One time, I was playing as purple.

816
00:42:17,862 --> 00:42:19,006
Speaker 0: I got that piece.

817
00:42:19,166 --> 00:42:20,170
Speaker 0: I realized what it did.

818
00:42:20,330 --> 00:42:21,333
Speaker 0: - I dropped it.

819
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:24,922
Speaker 0: It literally was like the biggest swing in points.

820
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:25,785
Speaker 0: It killed.

821
00:42:26,306 --> 00:42:27,850
Speaker 0: It has four damage as it does.

822
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:33,350
Speaker 0: - It killed four enemy guys, took no damage, saved my HQ from like a zillion damage.

823
00:42:34,172 --> 00:42:37,265
Speaker 0: - It was just unbelievable placement.

824
00:42:37,546 --> 00:42:38,390
Speaker 0: It was the best thing ever.

825
00:42:39,330 --> 00:42:41,059
Speaker 1: - But seriously, what else can we say?

826
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:43,250
Speaker 1: This is a game that is so cheap.

827
00:42:43,770 --> 00:42:45,830
Speaker 1: - It's on every phone unless you have like an old palm tree.

828
00:42:45,990 --> 00:42:48,257
Speaker 0: - You do have to pay more if you want all the colors.

829
00:42:48,779 --> 00:42:52,330
Speaker 0: I played it for a long ass time without buying the extra.

830
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:53,450
Speaker 1: - Just with the four base colors.

831
00:42:53,450 --> 00:43:00,815
Speaker 0: - Just with the four base colors, and then until I got bored of that, and then I just bought all the expansions in a bundle, - And then it was worth it.

832
00:43:01,277 --> 00:43:03,990
Speaker 0: I played the game so much, I was willing to pay that much for it.

833
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:07,850
Speaker 0: - I mean, other mobile phone games I've played sort of come and go, right?

834
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:11,190
Speaker 0: - Like, Angry Birds played it a ton, and then I haven't played Angry Birds in a hundred years.

835
00:43:11,850 --> 00:43:15,550
Speaker 0: - Various tower defenses on my phone, played a whole bunch, then stopped playing.

836
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,600
Speaker 0: - This is the only game that has true staying power.

837
00:43:18,780 --> 00:43:19,363
Speaker 0: Every poop.

838
00:43:19,784 --> 00:43:21,190
Speaker 0: I'll never delete this game from my phone.

839
00:43:21,330 --> 00:43:26,890
Speaker 0: - Even really good phone games like Super Hexagon, it's like, yeah, I haven't played that on my phone in forever.

840
00:43:27,170 --> 00:43:30,061
Speaker 0: - But I will always play Neuroshima Hex, probably.

841
00:43:30,262 --> 00:43:32,370
Speaker 0: Ultimate phone, number one phone game of all time.

842
00:43:32,370 --> 00:43:37,150
Speaker 1: - It's a good game of skill, it's like a puzzle, it requires a lot of thought to be good at.

843
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:44,450
Speaker 1: - While there's randomness, it's mitigated randomness, and part of your job as a player is to understand the effect of the randomness and try to plan for it.

844
00:43:44,470 --> 00:43:47,486
Speaker 0: - And if you got fucked by randomness, just restart the game and play a new one.

845
00:43:47,506 --> 00:43:48,310
Speaker 0: Before your poop is over.

846
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:51,983
Speaker 1: - There is no excuse not to have this game on your phone.

847
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:53,450
Speaker 1: Unless you are the kind of person...

848
00:43:53,470 --> 00:43:57,630
Speaker 0: - If I see someone who's a nerd, I expect this game to be on their phone.

849
00:43:57,690 --> 00:44:00,830
Speaker 1: - I expect that they're playing it when they're in a convention stall pooping.

850
00:44:01,210 --> 00:44:08,349
Speaker 0: - Yeah, and the other thing is a lot of other board games that are on phones or tablets are really only good for like, you know...

851
00:44:08,990 --> 00:44:10,049
Speaker 1: - Extended diarrhea sessions.

852
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:15,270
Speaker 0: - Well, you know, everyone's sitting around playing, say, Puerto Rico on the iPad or something like that.

853
00:44:15,390 --> 00:44:18,290
Speaker 1: - Yeah, you're not gonna play against the AI with settlers and have a good time.

854
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:26,870
Speaker 0: - Exactly, but this game is both sort of a German-ish, it's not German, but you know, a really good board game that you can also play on your phone and it will do so frequently.

855
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:27,956
Speaker 0: - Yup.

856
00:44:27,976 --> 00:44:28,930
Speaker 0: - Every day, in fact.

857
00:44:29,850 --> 00:44:30,613
Speaker 1: - And you know what?

858
00:44:30,674 --> 00:44:34,430
Speaker 1: It's also a good idle game to play with people, like if you're standing on a tram...

859
00:44:34,430 --> 00:44:36,727
Speaker 0: - It's got hot-swap, so your friend doesn't even need to have it.

860
00:44:36,747 --> 00:44:37,150
Speaker 0: - Yup.

861
00:44:37,370 --> 00:44:39,000
Speaker 0: - And you can also connect phone to phone.

862
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,066
Speaker 1: - Only with iOS.

863
00:44:40,086 --> 00:44:40,730
Speaker 0: - Yeah.

864
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:41,541
Speaker 1: - Not with Android.

865
00:44:41,562 --> 00:44:42,050
Speaker 0: - That sucks.

866
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:48,846
Speaker 1: - But yeah, if you're just waiting in line at, say, a PAX or you're on a tram trying to get to a PAX, it's about one game's worth.

867
00:44:49,026 --> 00:44:50,530
Speaker 1: is the time it takes you to get anywhere.

868
00:44:50,790 --> 00:44:56,110
Speaker 0: - Yeah, so you take a turn, give the phone to your friend, they take a turn, give it back to you, take a turn, and then eventually it's gonna be done real quick.

869
00:44:56,470 --> 00:44:56,570
Speaker 0: - Yup.

870
00:44:56,591 --> 00:45:01,050
Speaker 0: - You can play it while you're waiting for a meal to come at a restaurant after you've ordered.

871
00:45:07,210 --> 00:45:09,436
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

878
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,530
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

879
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:03,298
Speaker 0: - Magic Man.

880
00:46:03,318 --> 00:46:05,090
Speaker 1: - Magic Man is the best character.

881
00:46:05,450 --> 00:46:06,556
Speaker 0: - He actually came back recently.

882
00:46:06,576 --> 00:46:08,245
Speaker 1: - I know, but he said, "I'm not coming

883
00:46:08,305 --> 00:46:08,506
Speaker 1: back.".

884
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:09,953
Speaker 0: - He lied.

885
00:46:09,973 --> 00:46:12,805
Speaker 1: - Or I guess he wasn't coming back in relation to that.

886
00:46:12,825 --> 00:46:13,568
Speaker 0: - I guess.

887
00:46:13,588 --> 00:46:13,990
Speaker 0: - Alright.
