1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,705
Speaker 0: It's Thursday, April 13th, 2017.

2
00:00:10,705 --> 00:00:11,046
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,066 --> 00:00:17,798
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight chocolate.

4
00:00:18,922 --> 00:00:19,917
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,581 --> 00:00:31,540
Speaker 0: So if you follow me on Twitter, you know that one of the militant things I do is that I when I'm biking I literally stop and report to the police every single car that's in a bike lane.

6
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:44,835
Speaker 0: and because the way New York works use this app to do it and You actually get status reports and probably 90% of the time they're like like three days later the status changes to like Yeah, the cops are looking into it and then a week later.

7
00:00:44,895 --> 00:00:48,596
Speaker 0: It's like yeah We showed up and the the person who was parked there wasn't there anymore.

8
00:00:48,616 --> 00:00:49,299
Speaker 0: It's like no shit.

9
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:51,971
Speaker 1: There's apparently some car dealer on Queens Boulevard.

10
00:00:52,011 --> 00:00:53,819
Speaker 1: That's parking all their cars in the bike lane.

11
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,609
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like some used car dealer.

12
00:00:55,629 --> 00:01:00,860
Speaker 0: You got a check recurring problem And if you keep reporting it like event they'll go and like fuck up the business.

13
00:01:01,222 --> 00:01:04,540
Speaker 1: Apparently that police precinct like doesn't give a shit or something.

14
00:01:04,822 --> 00:01:14,380
Speaker 0: You got to put him in the ad because the stats from that Cause ripples and eventually like people like people get worried about go bike around Queens Boulevard find where this car dealership is.

15
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:18,799
Speaker 0: I'll show you on Google man, you know, you can report things just by putting the address in.

16
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,897
Speaker 0: you Don't actually have to be there go for it.

17
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:32,180
Speaker 0: But there's one thing that happened that the other day that I did not have to report Because I watched it go down because a cop was already there.

18
00:01:32,762 --> 00:01:36,933
Speaker 0: Like literally I see a situation and this situation was kind of amazing.

19
00:01:37,335 --> 00:01:39,260
Speaker 0: So I stopped and I pull out my phone.

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,859
Speaker 0: I'm about to like I take some pictures of it because it's pretty funny and I'm about to like report it.

21
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:52,209
Speaker 0: and Then I see a cop and I kind of wave at the cop and the cop kind of pulls up slow he slows down and he gives me this look.

22
00:01:52,691 --> 00:01:57,452
Speaker 0: and then he because he looks at the thing that I'm looking at and we're Looking at it together and he gives me this look.

23
00:01:57,492 --> 00:02:00,806
Speaker 0: that's like I got this And he gets out and deals with it.

24
00:02:00,867 --> 00:02:03,980
Speaker 0: So, you know Kent Avenue like where the bike path is that goes along the river.

25
00:02:05,203 --> 00:02:10,559
Speaker 0: So it's like a great bike path and cars have learned not to park there because cops do like just ticket you immediately there.

26
00:02:10,598 --> 00:02:10,739
Speaker 0: now.

27
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:16,620
Speaker 0: But there's this one building that has a loading dock and I never really thought about it.

28
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:21,140
Speaker 0: But the loading dock is like at the sidewalk and it faces directly into the street.

29
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:41,218
Speaker 0: I never see anyone use this loading dock and I realize now that I saw this situation occur It would be literally impossible to use this loading dock because what happened was a giant ass truck backed up to the loading dock blocking the sidewalk blocking both lanes of traffic and blocking the bike lane

30
00:02:41,981 --> 00:02:42,446
Speaker 1: blocking

31
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,563
Speaker 0: the entire Streets.

32
00:02:45,226 --> 00:02:51,995
Speaker 0: on Kent Avenue and the street isn't just a bike lane like because of gender You could load with a not giant truck you could load from like a van.

33
00:02:52,517 --> 00:02:56,922
Speaker 0: even a van Would block one lane of traffic Really?

34
00:02:57,062 --> 00:02:59,351
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the sidewalk is not wide there.

35
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:01,860
Speaker 0: So this truck is blocking the entire thing.

36
00:03:02,242 --> 00:03:05,520
Speaker 0: So the cop walks over and there's a guy like unloading.

37
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:10,040
Speaker 0: There's another guy in the truck and he says and I quote what the fuck are you doing?

38
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:12,399
Speaker 0: How do you think this is okay?

39
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,840
Speaker 0: He's like we got to use the loading dock and the cops like I don't care what you got to do.

40
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:21,219
Speaker 1: You can't just you can't do this can't block the road But he said it like that.

41
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,535
Speaker 0: He's like you can't do this and he makes his arm motion like this.

42
00:03:24,716 --> 00:03:29,220
Speaker 0: all of this around And the guys like what do you expect me to do and he's like well you're gonna get a ticket.

43
00:03:29,682 --> 00:03:33,414
Speaker 0: It's really a question of whether or not you move the car before we escalate this.

44
00:03:34,117 --> 00:03:35,040
Speaker 0: and it was real funny.

45
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,083
Speaker 0: And then I kept biking.

46
00:03:36,424 --> 00:03:44,820
Speaker 0: so I'm curious to see how this evolves over time because I'm pretty sure this building's loading dock existed Back when Kent Avenue was not used for much and no one gave a shit.

47
00:03:45,463 --> 00:03:52,846
Speaker 0: And now Kent Avenue is used for a lot of stuff and that loading dock can't be used anymore Night when no one gives a shit.

48
00:03:53,228 --> 00:03:59,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is if I really wish I really understood Why I am on a Sunday and I see a carnal in a bike lane.

49
00:04:00,296 --> 00:04:13,117
Speaker 1: I still report it Sure, but like why isn't there some sort of law in New York City that like all Major delivery type things must occur late at night Like you shouldn't be able to drive a tractor-trailer around, you know, the New York City at like 3 p.m?

50
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,928
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure the argument would like just waiting.

51
00:04:15,969 --> 00:04:17,274
Speaker 0: that would be more expensive.

52
00:04:17,353 --> 00:04:18,640
Speaker 0: My answer is that sucks.

53
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:24,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, just wait your ass in Jersey until you know The Sun Goes Down and then everyone goes home and then you can come deliver.

54
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:24,682
Speaker 1: You're getting.

55
00:04:24,742 --> 00:04:29,020
Speaker 0: a better way to go would be ban all personal vehicles in almost all of New York.

56
00:04:29,081 --> 00:04:40,440
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah ban cars obviously But and then delivery like basically let commercial cars drive and use do their business because if there aren't regular cars on the road They could just park in the street and it's totally fine.

57
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:51,939
Speaker 1: well Also, you could ban cars and then you could put like a freight train on say one of the you know avenues Yeah, and that everyone who needs delivered shit would just use the freight train.

58
00:04:52,281 --> 00:04:54,533
Speaker 0: Well the freight train you still got to do the final distribution.

59
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:55,880
Speaker 0: You still need a bunch of little drones.

60
00:04:56,481 --> 00:05:01,100
Speaker 1: Well, no, I mean it's like if you're a bodega you walk over the freight train you pick up your crate of bananas, right?

61
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:03,930
Speaker 0: You're not just gonna walk that stuff.

62
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:12,865
Speaker 1: if you if you're proposing the 1870s solution Yeah, if you're uh, but the train is like it can't be more than a few blocks away It goes right down the middle, right?

63
00:05:12,926 --> 00:05:15,657
Speaker 0: So it's like yeah, so my business is on I don't know.

64
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:25,120
Speaker 1: 11th It's up to your business to use a smaller conveyance mechanism That isn't a car to get your stuff from the vehicle of some kind to your place of business.

65
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:26,436
Speaker 0: I feel like yeah.

66
00:05:27,222 --> 00:05:30,817
Speaker 0: My solution is to do technology for 200 years in the future and yours is to go 200 years back.

67
00:05:32,003 --> 00:05:37,869
Speaker 1: Listen there are many ways you can go get your stuff from the train Personal vehicles in Manhattan anymore.

68
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:39,960
Speaker 1: I don't want any cars anywhere on earth.

69
00:05:40,341 --> 00:05:41,243
Speaker 1: Destroy all cars.

70
00:05:41,344 --> 00:05:42,407
Speaker 0: cars have their purpose.

71
00:05:42,447 --> 00:05:45,936
Speaker 0: V the idea of vehicles is one cars have a purpose.

72
00:05:45,956 --> 00:05:49,508
Speaker 0: There's a reason why you're not Inelected official banned cars.

73
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:51,414
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's Thursday.

74
00:05:51,434 --> 00:05:56,309

Speaker 1: They keep changing the schedule for this.

80
00:06:08,545 --> 00:06:12,740
Speaker 0: I only know about it because I follow some people on Twitter who work it or have worked.

81
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,710
Speaker 1: If anyway, it's the Star Wars convention.

82
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:16,520
Speaker 0: They tweet a lot about it, right?

83
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,440
Speaker 1: There's an official Star Wars convention.

84
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,400
Speaker 1: It happens every year every other year, but it's happening right the fuck now and this news is coming out of it.

85
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,500
Speaker 1: But all of these news's are so considering like you this thing has been happening for years.

86
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,994
Speaker 1: It was even happening like all the years between.

87
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:36,973
Speaker 1: I don't know when it started But there were a lot of these things even before Star Wars was revived, right?

88
00:06:36,993 --> 00:06:39,720
Speaker 0: I mean, there are still Firefly conventions, right?

89
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:44,000
Speaker 1: So it's like what nothing was happening at those except like Star Wars comic books.

90
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:50,640
Speaker 0: You know what it is, you know the anime con like circle jerk where fandom of the thing becomes like it becomes fans.

91
00:06:50,640 --> 00:07:09,436
Speaker 1: Exactly a fandom of the fandom of the thing twice removes like for years and years They'd no new official products other than like novels comics Fans of the fan culture of an old man, but this is an official convention.

92
00:07:09,456 --> 00:07:10,800
Speaker 1: This isn't some unofficial garbage.

93
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:12,005
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like fucking.

94
00:07:12,025 --> 00:07:13,170

Speaker 1: Yeah, this is like Harrison Ford.

Speaker 0: I'll do a keynote or whatever.

98
00:07:17,087 --> 00:07:17,469
Speaker 0: I don't think.

99
00:07:17,530 --> 00:07:19,340
Speaker 1: I don't think he's there but Mark Hamill's there.

100
00:07:19,984 --> 00:07:22,097
Speaker 1: I don't know Mark Hamill's definitely there.

101
00:07:22,198 --> 00:07:28,640
Speaker 1: anyway the point is All the news is coming out of this thing are the tiniest time.

102
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:31,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only is he there but he had a story about his plane having a problem landing.

103
00:07:32,062 --> 00:07:34,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, wasn't that when he almost died or whatever like just now?

104
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:36,499
Speaker 1: just now anyway.

105
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:53,500
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the tiny news is are like, oh they made a Carrie Fisher tribute thing and it's like yeah, we know that right It's like oh, there's a. there's some Thrawn Thing now that like Timothy Zahn has a new Thrawn thing that talks about origin of Thrawn.

106
00:07:54,507 --> 00:08:04,231
Speaker 1: You know, okay fanboys I like the idea of vice-admiral throw I like the character of vice-admiral thrown and I like his character design.

107
00:08:04,252 --> 00:08:07,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I read the all three Thrawn books.

108
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,814
Speaker 1: I read them complete a hundred percent.

109
00:08:08,915 --> 00:08:09,520
Speaker 0: I didn't even do that.

110
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,344
Speaker 0: Here's my extent.

111
00:08:10,444 --> 00:08:10,685
Speaker 0: every.

112
00:08:10,866 --> 00:08:15,310
Speaker 1: all the nerds say those are the best Star Wars books and it's like yeah Those are the best Star Wars books.

113
00:08:15,331 --> 00:08:16,519
Speaker 1: They're the least smelly poop.

114
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:19,186
Speaker 1: The character is cool.

115
00:08:19,206 --> 00:08:20,532
Speaker 1: The books are not.

116
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:22,540
Speaker 1: so I don't think this new book is gonna be cool.

117
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:28,522
Speaker 1: But apparently the story of Thrawn is like he was a badass general in whatever race He's in.

118
00:08:28,642 --> 00:08:34,611
Speaker 1: but they sort of like shunned him and then the Empire found him and the Emperor was like Oh, this guy's actually pretty good.

119
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:35,860
Speaker 1: Let's make him awesome.

120
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:46,785
Speaker 0: And then so he was just I feel like especially in a canon like Star Wars You're almost better off when the cool characters that don't have backstories at least backstories that were public Can you to have mysterious on.

121
00:08:46,825 --> 00:08:52,909
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean if you just watch the Star Wars movie Boba Fett Fucking badass bounty hunter.

122
00:08:52,929 --> 00:08:54,235
Speaker 0: You don't know anything about him.

123
00:08:54,336 --> 00:08:55,039
Speaker 0: Yeah or her?

124
00:08:55,260 --> 00:09:07,840
Speaker 0: Yeah no idea what this entities deal is other than jetpack green armor awesome ship and Super dangerous except not super dangerous because once Boba Fett actually goes into action just falls into the Sarla.

125
00:09:08,622 --> 00:09:14,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, well that was not super dangerous pretty much really at any point in the original.

126
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:17,633
Speaker 0: So he seemed super dangerous at least until a moment.

127
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:19,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we see him in episode 5.

128
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:20,946
Speaker 0: You're just like who is that?

129
00:09:21,187 --> 00:09:21,830
Speaker 1: What's up with that?

130
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,835
Speaker 0: What's that guy doing?

131
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:23,960
Speaker 0: Why is he hanging out?

132
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,315
Speaker 0: I'm sure I'm sure that Vader who is cool enough to hang out with Darth Vader and not get.

133
00:09:28,596 --> 00:09:39,979
Speaker 1: I'm sure I could get Information on this very easily but there were those other bounty hunters standing next to Boba Fett in episode 5 and I want to know About them, but I'm sure that would be easy to find out about Star Wars.

134
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:43,111
Speaker 1: nerds You're probably gonna post right now telling me all their names.

135
00:09:43,292 --> 00:09:44,396
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just don't.

136
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:49,400
Speaker 1: but yeah It's weird that like now that's the thing is right is like why am I talking about this?

137
00:09:49,561 --> 00:09:52,971
Speaker 1: only these tiny insignificant news is right about Star Wars.

138
00:09:53,031 --> 00:09:57,755
Speaker 1: the most significant nerd thing there is is because Star Wars is revived now, right?

139
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,700
Speaker 1: It's like we get a Star Wars movie every year now Like Star Wars is like more alive now than it has ever been since the original trilogy.

140
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,952
Speaker 0: Like it is possible that ten years from now There will have been ten years of just constant Star Wars.

141
00:10:11,153 --> 00:10:12,960
Speaker 1: It is more alive now than ever.

142
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:18,560
Speaker 1: Why are the news is at the big Star Wars convention just as insignificant as they were when Star Wars was door?

143
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:19,303
Speaker 1: Shouldn't?

144
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:19,685
Speaker 1: the news?

145
00:10:19,746 --> 00:10:22,760
Speaker 1: is a guy ginormous Star Wars like so one.

146
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:23,884
Speaker 0: What there is.

147
00:10:23,904 --> 00:10:27,696
Speaker 0: you can't actually generate that much news from one more movie coming out.

148
00:10:27,716 --> 00:10:28,760
Speaker 0: That isn't just spoilers.

149
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:31,272
Speaker 1: You can you just you know spill the beans.

150
00:10:31,774 --> 00:10:32,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, too.

151
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:38,220
Speaker 0: The momentum of the fandom of Star Wars is his hit that second-order circle jerk.

152
00:10:38,942 --> 00:10:46,896
Speaker 0: The people who are invested in Star Wars fandom really care about Star Wars fandom Possibly more so than actual Star Wars.

153
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:54,092
Speaker 0: at this point This is not the kind of convention I would ever go to because odd which is interesting to me I mean, I don't want to go to it.

154
00:10:54,132 --> 00:11:00,386
Speaker 1: I wouldn't go out of my way But if it was for some reason extremely convenient to go I would go have it's I would go.

155
00:11:00,406 --> 00:11:05,304
Speaker 1: if it was extremely convenient to go for some reason and cheap I would go one time.

156
00:11:05,806 --> 00:11:10,280
Speaker 0: I mean, I like Star Wars in the Javits and I'm in town or two.

157
00:11:10,642 --> 00:11:15,368
Speaker 1: I happen to be in the town where it is for some other reason But that other reason isn't a pack someone.

158
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:19,502
Speaker 1: if I if there's someone someone flies me there it's my job to go there I don't know.

159
00:11:19,603 --> 00:11:22,578
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess if they invited me to give the keynote I would go.

160
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:25,109
Speaker 0: Hi, everybody.

161
00:11:25,129 --> 00:11:26,279
Speaker 0: I don't know why I'm here.

162
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:35,894
Speaker 1: I know less about Star Wars than the rest of you nerds Even though I like it just as much as even though most of you were born long After the last of the original Star Wars movies came out.

163
00:11:36,075 --> 00:11:39,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway Okay other news tiny news, right?

164
00:11:39,249 --> 00:11:46,189
Speaker 1: So Fuji the camera company not the mountain In stacks, right they have instax cameras.

165
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:47,432
Speaker 1: people don't know about these.

166
00:11:47,452 --> 00:11:48,616
Speaker 0: I don't know about these.

167
00:11:48,636 --> 00:11:50,100
Speaker 1: They're basically Polaroid cameras.

168
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:56,211
Speaker 1: They've existed for like a lot of years now And they have two kinds yet the mini and they have the wide.

169
00:11:56,512 --> 00:12:04,770
Speaker 1: so the and you buy basically instax film Which is like Polaroid film and it's you know You stick it in there and it takes photos and they're pretty good.

170
00:12:04,911 --> 00:12:07,340
Speaker 1: and they're fun because they're like Polaroids only modern.

171
00:12:08,402 --> 00:12:12,120
Speaker 1: But the mini ones the pictures they shoot are like these vertical things.

172
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,979
Speaker 1: It looks like someone took a phone photo of you with the phone?

173
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:19,392
Speaker 1: No, and the wide ones are.

174
00:12:19,412 --> 00:12:25,700
Speaker 1: they're kind of more normal wide shaped But they're kind of more expensive and unpopular.

175
00:12:26,402 --> 00:12:29,351
Speaker 1: Like Polaroid took square photos.

176
00:12:29,892 --> 00:12:31,958
Speaker 1: It didn't take photos in some weird-ass square.

177
00:12:33,062 --> 00:12:34,908
Speaker 0: They were square for this square cuz I had.

178
00:12:35,109 --> 00:12:38,100
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah pretty sure I got some Polaroids.

179
00:12:39,004 --> 00:12:40,028
Speaker 1: Really took the stand.

180
00:12:40,068 --> 00:12:47,257
Speaker 1: old old-ish camera standard Polaroid cameras The default took square photos on standard Polaroid film, right?

181
00:12:47,297 --> 00:12:47,980
Speaker 1: They were squares.

182
00:12:48,662 --> 00:12:53,300
Speaker 1: So now finally after many many moons, they're going to announce like in a week.

183
00:12:53,923 --> 00:12:54,385
Speaker 1: It's almost.

184
00:12:54,445 --> 00:12:56,475
Speaker 1: it's not it's a rumor, but it's pretty much definite.

185
00:12:57,058 --> 00:13:03,345
Speaker 1: the in I mean there's been a website for this for a long time, but they never had like specifics like, you know This is the actual camera.

186
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:06,600
Speaker 1: This is how much it will cost and we're gonna say right they're gonna have square.

187
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:18,960
Speaker 1: So if you like some Polaroid action, right where you take a photo and goes and it prints out immediately Now you can have the the real deal and not some weird-ass shape coming out of there, right?

188
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,884
Speaker 1: So, all right, if anyone wants to buy me this You go right ahead.

189
00:13:23,904 --> 00:13:33,916
Speaker 1: I feel like my cell phone suffices because I don't really print I don't need physical pictures But it's like the thing is once you have it it's suddenly like oh like you're at a convention.

190
00:13:33,936 --> 00:13:35,163
Speaker 1: take a photo and like there It is.

191
00:13:35,204 --> 00:13:35,638
Speaker 1: Here you go.

192
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:41,446
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember when you said we use the printer and you were taking pictures of everybody and sticking around in Connecticut that one Time people were kind of into it.

193
00:13:41,567 --> 00:13:43,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you're not into it until like.

194
00:13:43,538 --> 00:13:44,806
Speaker 0: so You know this is for you.

195
00:13:44,846 --> 00:13:45,610
Speaker 0: do it before.

196
00:13:46,214 --> 00:13:47,581
Speaker 0: if you like our friend chase like you.

197
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:55,020
Speaker 0: just you go to random parties hang out with people if you're at like a random party in someone's apartment where there's Like 10 to 20 people like that level of party.

198
00:13:55,622 --> 00:14:01,679
Speaker 0: This is the kind of thing that breaks the ice and you like take a picture of someone and hand it to them and suddenly People are passing it around.

199
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:13,640
Speaker 0: So in some other minor news you guys all probably saw that United Airways, which is one of the airlines I've been boycotting for a long goddamn time because they fucked me multiple times.

200
00:14:14,001 --> 00:14:16,549
Speaker 1: I mean, I never flown them ever and I never would.

201
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,660
Speaker 0: they have fucked me the majority of the times I have flown them.

202
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like I've like jet blue.

203
00:14:21,650 --> 00:14:29,400
Speaker 1: if I have if I have to go to a foreign country I'll usually try to use like the airline from that country right because I fly a lot.

204
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:32,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have a very different value proposition there.

205
00:14:32,502 --> 00:14:38,504
Speaker 0: I try to fly in a very limited number of airlines to maximize yes perks and benefits Obviously, right?

206
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:44,300
Speaker 1: That's why I choose jet blue if at all possible, but if I'm going to say like yerp I'm gonna try to choose like Lufthansa.

207
00:14:45,822 --> 00:14:49,299
Speaker 1: Go fancy, right if I'm going to like, you know, if I got if I can take you know.

208
00:14:49,902 --> 00:14:51,711
Speaker 0: So fancy literally doesn't matter.

209
00:14:51,892 --> 00:14:55,606
Speaker 0: unless you fly a higher class though Coach is pretty much the same everywhere.

210
00:14:55,626 --> 00:15:00,240
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll still take coach on Lufthansa versus coach on Drek.

211
00:15:00,804 --> 00:15:02,459
Speaker 1: Right Drek air you mean?

212
00:15:03,761 --> 00:15:04,243
Speaker 0: Frontier.

213
00:15:04,443 --> 00:15:06,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever it is spirit.

214
00:15:06,411 --> 00:15:08,479
Speaker 1: Yeah exactly what I'm saying, right?

215
00:15:09,141 --> 00:15:12,317
Speaker 1: So but if I have to go on a domestic flight, I can't do jet blue.

216
00:15:12,357 --> 00:15:14,584
Speaker 1: for some reason It doesn't go there right.

217
00:15:15,045 --> 00:15:16,509
Speaker 1: I can go like Southwest.

218
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:17,953
Speaker 1: It's not bad, right?

219
00:15:17,973 --> 00:15:20,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I've flown Southwest recently.

220
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:24,278
Speaker 0: They're not nearly as great as people chalk them up to be or that they used to be.

221
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,523
Speaker 1: no They're not.

222
00:15:25,683 --> 00:15:27,390
Speaker 0: but blue also not that great.

223
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,040
Speaker 0: Like they're on time records been dropping as far as I can see, right?

224
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,010
Speaker 0: There's the last two jet blue flights.

225
00:15:32,091 --> 00:15:37,170
Speaker 1: I took we're more than an hour late But who else do you know who's better at a domestic flight?

226
00:15:37,231 --> 00:15:39,680
Speaker 0: Honestly these days I fly Delta mostly domestically.

227
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:43,993
Speaker 1: No, it's cost about the same as jet blue and it's not as nice though.

228
00:15:44,575 --> 00:15:45,899
Speaker 0: It's actually nicer in coach.

229
00:15:47,542 --> 00:15:50,539
Speaker 1: The only problem American Airlines is basically equal to Delta also.

230
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,403
Speaker 1: They're both.

231
00:15:51,423 --> 00:15:55,480
Speaker 0: only problem with flying Delta instead of jet blue domestically.

232
00:15:56,122 --> 00:16:06,455
Speaker 0: Is that jet blue has the best terminal at JFK and Delta has two terminals both of which are yeah But jet blue increasingly like even go like go into packs.

233
00:16:06,957 --> 00:16:07,680
Speaker 0: in San Antonio.

234
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:12,560
Speaker 0: Delta has direct flights that are way better than anything jet blue has for set for that city.

235
00:16:12,721 --> 00:16:16,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, jet blue does not go to most places I go anymore.

236
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:20,652
Speaker 0: So packs prime is literally the only time I ever fly jet blue anymore.

237
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:22,537
Speaker 0: Mmm, like when would I ever use them?

238
00:16:22,557 --> 00:16:24,342
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I Florida.

239
00:16:24,944 --> 00:16:26,249
Speaker 0: why would I go to Florida?

240
00:16:26,270 --> 00:16:28,960
Speaker 0: and actually the last time I went to Florida?

241
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:32,331
Speaker 0: I flew jet blue our flight there and our flight back.

242
00:16:32,371 --> 00:16:33,455
Speaker 0: We're more than an hour late.

243
00:16:34,097 --> 00:16:36,128
Speaker 1: I never have problem It's every time I fly.

244
00:16:36,148 --> 00:16:37,779
Speaker 0: When was the last time you took jet blue to Florida?

245
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,788
Speaker 0: Okay, well we did it last year for a wedding.

246
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:45,460
Speaker 1: it's like two years ago, but they're really good to go to tropical places.

247
00:16:46,140 --> 00:16:46,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

248
00:16:47,325 --> 00:16:51,000
Speaker 0: But anyway all that aside so you probably know the story fuck United.

249
00:16:51,201 --> 00:16:56,399
Speaker 0: I got no like the fact that the media decided to start talking about the guy who was dragged off the plane.

250
00:16:56,419 --> 00:17:03,379
Speaker 0: and Not only is that fucked up that they're like, ooh, he had a troubled past Even though that has no bearing on the story.

251
00:17:03,741 --> 00:17:11,638
Speaker 0: But apparently most of that troubled past was a different guy with the same name And the guy might have a concussion like shits bad.

252
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:20,728
Speaker 0: But the Democratic Party like a whole bunch of senators actually put forth a bill like yesterday and this bill The customer is not.

253
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:22,800
Speaker 0: Carlos act is actually super great.

254
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:33,219
Speaker 1: What it basically says is if someone's already boarded a plane, you cannot kick them off like too late Dibs, what if you let more people on the plane than their receipts and they're already on the plane?

255
00:17:33,764 --> 00:17:37,632
Speaker 0: It appears that in that case Think not everyone is musical chairs.

256
00:17:37,673 --> 00:17:38,618
Speaker 0: Not everyone could sit down.

257
00:17:39,061 --> 00:17:41,028
Speaker 0: So I guess the last person is not sitting.

258
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:46,072
Speaker 1: but what if my ticket has a seat and a letter and number on it And someone's sitting in my seat and letter?

259
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,480
Speaker 0: then that's not the right ticket to pass.

260
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,305
Speaker 0: You can kick them off.

261
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:49,572
Speaker 1: What if there's their ticket?

262
00:17:49,673 --> 00:17:54,384
Speaker 1: also says so You messed up Yeah in those cases.

263
00:17:54,745 --> 00:17:57,473
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure they just get fined but it goes.

264
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:06,373
Speaker 0: the most important part is that You cannot bump people Unless they do it voluntarily quote.

265
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:18,740
Speaker 0: they must provide sufficient incentives to encourage passengers to voluntarily deplane Meaning they got to keep up in the ante until someone says you know what I'll take the hundred thousand dollars, right?

266
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,864
Speaker 0: Okay fly tomorrow.

267
00:18:20,346 --> 00:18:23,600
Speaker 1: Well, I mean they're gonna eventually say alright, we're just not gonna bump anyone.

268
00:18:25,923 --> 00:18:28,978
Speaker 0: But this bill like I was reading through it it's great.

269
00:18:29,219 --> 00:18:36,504
Speaker 1: sure There's a lot of great bills that get written in legislatures all around the world that have legislate places that legislatures and you might think They don't pass.

270
00:18:36,624 --> 00:18:38,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you might know whatever.

271
00:18:38,331 --> 00:18:40,179
Speaker 0: well now so there's a difference between.

272
00:18:40,219 --> 00:18:40,480
Speaker 1: let me go.

273
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,460
Speaker 1: You want me to go dig up all the amazing bills that weren't passed?

274
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:45,266
Speaker 0: Here's your problem.

275
00:18:45,326 --> 00:18:47,200
Speaker 0: You don't really know a lot about how the Senate works.

276
00:18:47,260 --> 00:18:47,722
Speaker 0: There's a big.

277
00:18:47,742 --> 00:18:54,767
Speaker 0: there's a lot of bills that you say that you you think of in this light are bills that are put forth By basically one person's.

278
00:18:54,807 --> 00:18:58,340
Speaker 0: they can say they put it forth and has no chance of passing or even getting the committee.

279
00:18:58,942 --> 00:19:05,930
Speaker 0: But there's another class of bill that has two co-sponsors One from the Democrats and one from the Republicans.

280
00:19:06,392 --> 00:19:08,540
Speaker 0: those bills have a much higher percentage of passing.

281
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,830
Speaker 0: Then there's bills that have a lot of co-sponsors.

282
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:16,244
Speaker 0: This bill actually has a lot of co-sponsors But they're all Democrat.

283
00:19:16,886 --> 00:19:20,240
Speaker 0: So yeah, it turns out the Republican Party is really against this bill, right?

284
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:23,459
Speaker 0: Cuz probably as airlines pay them It goes way back than that.

285
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:38,158
Speaker 0: so there's a Mother Jones investigative journalism article that actually goes through the long history of airline regulation and Basically, the Republicans are the sole reason air travel sucks in the United States and have been for decades.

286
00:19:38,178 --> 00:19:42,608
Speaker 0: the Republican Party It's not news hates you for flying We're not.

287
00:19:42,628 --> 00:19:43,695
Speaker 0: we don't do news on geek nights.

288
00:19:43,715 --> 00:19:44,360
Speaker 0: We do commentary.

289
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:55,580
Speaker 0: So I highly recommend you read this article because this is actually very detailed and very fascinating about how much better Pretty much everything in America would be if the Republican Party didn't exist.

290
00:19:58,608 --> 00:19:59,700
Speaker 1: You don't need to read any news.

291
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,680
Speaker 1: That's the only sentence you need to know and you could just never read a newspaper.

292
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:05,160
Speaker 1: I think like and as long as you know that you're good.

293
00:20:05,301 --> 00:20:07,794
Speaker 0: It's not just like the Republicans are wrong about a lot of.

294
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:13,056
Speaker 1: stop repeating it every day But we know when was the last single person listening knows the sentence you just said.

295
00:20:13,117 --> 00:20:13,819
Speaker 0: I don't think they do.

296
00:20:14,181 --> 00:20:15,166
Speaker 1: How do you not know that?

297
00:20:15,186 --> 00:20:17,780
Speaker 0: why do you get so weird every time people talk about politics?

298
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,595
Speaker 0: It's not about talking about politics really weird and start yelling, you know, it's repetition, right?

299
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:25,050
Speaker 0: It's like the last time I brought this up on geek nights.

300
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,160
Speaker 1: It's not about bringing up by geek nights.

301
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:27,559
Speaker 0: All right.

302
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,884
Speaker 0: When was the last time I brought it?

303
00:20:28,924 --> 00:20:29,044
Speaker 0: up?

304
00:20:29,085 --> 00:20:29,967
Speaker 0: in a casual conversation.

305
00:20:29,987 --> 00:20:34,160
Speaker 1: every single goddamn day when every single person on every single?

306
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,589
Speaker 1: Communications media.

307
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:36,719
Speaker 0: when was the last time I did it?

308
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:42,036
Speaker 1: Every last time you tweeted anything about politics anything earlier today.

309
00:20:42,057 --> 00:20:42,920

310
00:20:44,321 --> 00:20:44,943
Speaker 0: Politics today?

00:20:45,023 --> 00:20:45,726
Speaker 1: not at all today.

00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:46,448
Speaker 1: Not even once.

313
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:47,251
Speaker 1: no, probably not.

314
00:20:47,271 --> 00:20:48,175
Speaker 1: Let's have a retweet.

315
00:20:48,355 --> 00:20:49,620

Speaker 1: There you go.

321
00:21:01,645 --> 00:21:02,649
Speaker 1: You're done.

322
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:06,420
Speaker 0: Okay, the United thing that you're saying that that counts as politics.

323
00:21:06,501 --> 00:21:07,700
Speaker 1: It's all the same news.

324
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:13,340
Speaker 1: All of these news is are all the same news, which is there are evil people in government who are owned by corporations.

325
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,747
Speaker 1: They're all in the country.

326
00:21:16,788 --> 00:21:17,109
Speaker 0: the end.

327
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:17,571
Speaker 0: I'll agree.

328
00:21:17,591 --> 00:21:18,655
Speaker 1: That's all the same news.

329
00:21:18,735 --> 00:21:20,060
Speaker 1: I will agree with every single day.

330
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:24,400
Speaker 1: They could just write that same exact thing on every front of every newspaper and there's no reason to even print anything.

331
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,407
Speaker 0: I will agree that they are all the same.

332
00:21:26,467 --> 00:21:31,323
Speaker 0: if you're a simpleton with simplistic views of the world cuz the details don't matter that Fundamental thing is.

333
00:21:31,443 --> 00:21:32,627
Speaker 0: you have not refuted my point.

334
00:21:32,747 --> 00:21:37,462
Speaker 0: So it stands simpleton with simple views of how the world you know There is.

335
00:21:37,883 --> 00:21:39,168
Speaker 1: it's not a complex thing.

336
00:21:39,389 --> 00:21:42,380
Speaker 0: So in some other political news, actually this one will be pretty interesting.

337
00:21:42,863 --> 00:21:43,528
Speaker 1: Same exact thing.

338
00:21:43,568 --> 00:21:52,626
Speaker 0: You just said this one is pretty much Guaranteed to happen due to the structure of how it's coming to be in the way the Canadian government is right now Also with some Wall Street stuff.

339
00:21:52,646 --> 00:21:56,339
Speaker 0: I was paying attention to that is that is suspiciously related to this.

340
00:21:56,921 --> 00:22:04,108
Speaker 0: But Canada is just straight-up legalizing marijuana by July of next year like hundred percent Recreational marijuana.

341
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:04,853
Speaker 0: good luck.

342
00:22:04,913 --> 00:22:05,356
Speaker 0: Have fun.

343
00:22:05,396 --> 00:22:14,748
Speaker 0: It's gonna be great All right This will be interesting because it's probably gonna be a huge economic boom for Canada cuz it's basically Semi legal there.

344
00:22:14,848 --> 00:22:17,385
Speaker 0: Anyway, like you can just buy it in Toronto No one seems to care.

345
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:19,759
Speaker 0: but now it'll be like legit just normal and legal.

346
00:22:20,182 --> 00:22:21,820
Speaker 1: I feel you be smoking weed in the street though.

347
00:22:24,502 --> 00:22:32,820
Speaker 1: See cuz like as much as I'm down with legalization I would rather people smoke weed in the street than cigarettes sure But I'd much rather not have any smoking in the street allowed.

348
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,527
Speaker 1: It's like smoke your brains out in your house.

349
00:22:34,948 --> 00:22:38,020
Speaker 1: smoke your brains out in like your weed special restaurant place.

350
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:41,552
Speaker 1: That clearly lets people know that this weed goes.

351
00:22:41,613 --> 00:22:41,894
Speaker 0: got it.

352
00:22:41,974 --> 00:22:49,320
Speaker 0: all the places where this happens It's either just as restricted as cigarettes or you can't smoke it in public places, right?

353
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:53,036
Speaker 1: But smoking this to even too much cigarette smoking on the street, right?

354
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:53,799
Speaker 1: I want to get rid of that.

355
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,987
Speaker 0: No, no, I agree.

356
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:57,060
Speaker 0: You should smoke on any street in New York City.

357
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:10,521
Speaker 1: I mean I think if you want to smoke something you got to go into a private place that allows it or into a box where we Smoking marijuana with like a joint is something that only old people and super like moron potheads Do.

358
00:23:10,842 --> 00:23:17,918
Speaker 1: normal people just use vapes or pills or other things these days Jerry use whatever you want to use But you know don't breathe it on anybody else.

359
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:22,711
Speaker 0: Yeah, no, I would like to ban all cigarette smoke.

360
00:23:22,732 --> 00:23:24,215
Speaker 1: That's my only concern right?

361
00:23:24,255 --> 00:23:31,139
Speaker 0: It's like I'm all for the legalization In serving in public in any way that will get in your way.

362
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:35,787
Speaker 1: Imagine if tomorrow, right?

363
00:23:35,808 --> 00:23:41,128
Speaker 1: Yeah the United States which would never happen was just like, alright We just basically the same as tobacco.

364
00:23:41,168 --> 00:23:43,017
Speaker 1: you can just buy it in the bodega everywhere.

365
00:23:43,037 --> 00:23:44,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, right You're gonna start.

366
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,420
Speaker 1: all the people who you know smoke weed, but wouldn't smoke tobacco or not?

367
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:59,179
Speaker 0: Because people smoke weed in public in New York City all the time not as much as like way more than especially because I bike to work through Brooklyn.

368
00:24:00,361 --> 00:24:01,063
Speaker 0: People are like.

369
00:24:01,183 --> 00:24:04,935
Speaker 0: I literally see people just smoking weed on the street almost everything.

370
00:24:04,955 --> 00:24:06,299
Speaker 1: I imagined it was even more.

371
00:24:06,963 --> 00:24:10,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the thing is most people would rather smoke it at home because you're gonna chill.

372
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:13,459
Speaker 0: You're not gonna be walking around the agro city smoking your weed.

373
00:24:14,581 --> 00:24:15,203
Speaker 0: People might.

374
00:24:15,344 --> 00:24:17,290
Speaker 1: it's like suddenly if you're allowed to you will.

375
00:24:17,611 --> 00:24:21,345
Speaker 0: and one more tiny news because I see a lot of you fucking this Up and retweeting things.

376
00:24:21,365 --> 00:24:22,209
Speaker 0: You shouldn't have retweeted.

377
00:24:22,711 --> 00:24:24,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, the US used a giant bomb.

378
00:24:24,821 --> 00:24:31,120
Speaker 0: It's called a MOAB which literally stands for mother of all bombs because that's the kind of awesome name the military uses.

379
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:33,631
Speaker 0: Yeah, it actually stands for.

380
00:24:33,852 --> 00:24:35,539
Speaker 0: officially stands for something different.

381
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:39,034
Speaker 1: Everyone it doesn't matter what it officially stands.

382
00:24:39,114 --> 00:24:39,515
Speaker 1: Yeah.

383
00:24:39,715 --> 00:24:57,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's officially pronounced gif - yeah Yeah, okay, but I just want to point out because I saw a lot of people making this mistake Do not compare this bomb to Hiroshima because About that who is doing?

384
00:24:57,167 --> 00:25:08,592
Speaker 0: the major newspapers lots of media people okay, so first of all all I have to say this is I can sum this up real quick Scott a Kill a ton means a thousand tons.

385
00:25:08,752 --> 00:25:10,640
Speaker 1: How many times how many tons is this bomb?

386
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:14,629
Speaker 0: 22,000 pounds.

387
00:25:14,649 --> 00:25:16,456
Speaker 0: so divide that by two 11 11 tons.

388
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,111
Speaker 0: So this was an 11 ton bomb not an 11.

389
00:25:21,111 --> 00:25:23,216
Speaker 1: so it's a dynamite bomb.

390
00:25:23,256 --> 00:25:25,463
Speaker 1: It's not like a c4 bomb It's just dynamite.

391
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:26,245
Speaker 0: It's not dynamite.

392
00:25:26,425 --> 00:25:26,867
Speaker 1: What is it?

393
00:25:27,890 --> 00:25:28,953
Speaker 0: I don't actually know.

394
00:25:28,973 --> 00:25:29,434
Speaker 0: I think it's.

395
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:31,500
Speaker 0: I think it's thermobaric, but I'm not sure.

396
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,108
Speaker 1: All right, but the way this little air bomb It's not even one kiloton right.

397
00:25:36,208 --> 00:25:38,795
Speaker 1: and not only is it not only is it point?

398
00:25:38,996 --> 00:25:40,400
Speaker 0: Oh one kiloton, right?

399
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:47,039
Speaker 1: So not only is the size of it so small right, but it's not radioactive in any way shape or form.

400
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:47,663
Speaker 1: So there's.

401
00:25:47,703 --> 00:25:50,500
Speaker 1: no there's no horrible flashing burning.

402
00:25:50,741 --> 00:25:57,800
Speaker 0: They're comparing the size of the explosion because they don't understand that I kill a ton is a thousand tons.

403
00:25:58,322 --> 00:25:59,667
Speaker 0: Yeah, a thousand.

404
00:25:59,687 --> 00:26:00,952
Speaker 0: I don't think you understand.

405
00:26:00,972 --> 00:26:02,638
Speaker 1: wasn't Hiroshima like 15 kilotons.

406
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,751
Speaker 0: It's between 10 and 20 depending on we can't really know.

407
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:08,135
Speaker 1: that was pretty much exactly right.

408
00:26:08,155 --> 00:26:09,599
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're pretty pretty much right.

409
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:15,894
Speaker 1: so 15,000 versus 11. yeah 11 is really high right?

410
00:26:15,914 --> 00:26:17,120
Speaker 1: I mean you turn it up to 11.

411
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,165
Speaker 1: That's like a crab.

412
00:26:18,185 --> 00:26:25,384
Speaker 1: turned it up to 11 the crappiest new turning it up to 15,000 and That's the crappiest nuke.

413
00:26:25,846 --> 00:26:27,711
Speaker 1: right that's just the atom bomb.

414
00:26:27,932 --> 00:26:35,788
Speaker 1: if you use you know a nuclear missile an ICBM from the Cold War yeah, that's well That's a that's megaton.

415
00:26:35,848 --> 00:26:38,340
Speaker 0: luckily the modern weapons are not in those old ranges.

416
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:42,453
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying the biggest weapon ever built our megaton weapon hot.

417
00:26:42,613 --> 00:26:48,900
Speaker 0: so the big deal with the big deal with the biggest nuclear Like actual deliverable nuclear nuclear weapon ever built was the Tsar Bomba.

418
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,145
Speaker 0: You know how many megatons that was?

419
00:26:50,205 --> 00:26:51,912
Speaker 1: that's a much better name than Moab.

420
00:26:52,052 --> 00:26:53,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, they actually called it the Tsar Bomba.

421
00:26:54,522 --> 00:26:54,923
Speaker 0: Do you know?

422
00:26:54,943 --> 00:26:56,167
Speaker 0: I love Bomba.

423
00:26:56,368 --> 00:26:58,214
Speaker 0: how how big do you think it's explosion?

424
00:26:58,234 --> 00:26:58,997
Speaker 0: wasn't it so big?

425
00:26:59,017 --> 00:26:59,860
Speaker 1: they were afraid to use it.

426
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,302
Speaker 1: So they didn't.

427
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:06,289
Speaker 0: uh they did use it once, but they ran it at half yield Mmm, so it only.

428
00:27:06,329 --> 00:27:13,503
Speaker 0: it only blew up at 50 megatons 5-0 Mega.

429
00:27:13,583 --> 00:27:18,980
Speaker 0: so and if they used a uranium tamper instead of the lead one it would have been a hundred megatons.

430
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:21,279
Speaker 0: Give or take 20 megatons.

431
00:27:21,702 --> 00:27:21,904
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

432
00:27:22,570 --> 00:27:23,660
Speaker 0: the biggest weapon the u.s.

433
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:28,535
Speaker 0: Ever fielded on an ICBM was I believe I want to say 20 to 25 megatons.

434
00:27:29,036 --> 00:27:33,168
Speaker 0: modern weapons are 700 kilotons to about.

435
00:27:33,228 --> 00:27:34,612
Speaker 0: I want to say 1.2.

436
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:40,719
Speaker 0: Megatons because bigger weapons are Stupid unless you want to end the world or destroy an entire country.

437
00:27:41,061 --> 00:27:43,919
Speaker 1: Hmm, so maybe we do want to enjoy a story an entire country.

438
00:27:44,361 --> 00:27:44,722
Speaker 1: But I don't.

439
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:48,092
Speaker 1: the thing is the countries who want to destroy are not really that big.

440
00:27:48,113 --> 00:27:51,566
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like it's like Russia is so big.

441
00:27:51,606 --> 00:27:59,020
Speaker 1: if you want to destroy them you would need so many bombs anyway Even at the max and North Korea is really tiny and Eritrea is even tinier.

442
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:06,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, the reason we used to have those big bombs is because there's this concept called circular error probable Basically, it's the it's the rain.

443
00:28:06,388 --> 00:28:08,254
Speaker 0: It's the radius where if you launch a nuke.

444
00:28:08,876 --> 00:28:11,646
Speaker 0: There's a 50/50 shot It'll be inside that radius.

445
00:28:12,208 --> 00:28:15,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only news weapons used to be terrifyingly inaccurate.

446
00:28:15,501 --> 00:28:18,940
Speaker 1: We made them huge so sure so people don't know anything about bombs.

447
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:20,999
Speaker 1: I guess that's an interesting thing to show guys.

448
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:27,686
Speaker 1: But I use of this weapon is the use of the weapon is only otherwise notable in the news We already discussed which is they?

449
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,893
Speaker 1: the people who run the world are evil the end.

450
00:28:30,094 --> 00:28:31,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, but do not just.

451
00:28:33,464 --> 00:28:34,129
Speaker 0: How do you met?

452
00:28:34,149 --> 00:28:35,459
Speaker 0: people don't understand the K.

453
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,989
Speaker 1: I guess people don't understand technology.

454
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,478
Speaker 1: look at look at the science reporting in this world.

455
00:28:40,498 --> 00:28:42,166
Speaker 0: true You know problem is real.

456
00:28:42,206 --> 00:28:44,678
Speaker 0: science reporting is incomprehensible even to smart people.

457
00:28:44,839 --> 00:28:59,140
Speaker 0: so But anyway things of the day, what do you got for me, so What could be cooler than like a grandma?

469
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:23,874

00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:46,177
Speaker 1: That is perhaps more awesome than other grandmas I have seen maybe just equally awesome to those other awesome grandma.

477
00:29:46,358 --> 00:29:50,349
Speaker 1: anyway I don't know if she's a grandma, but she's old enough to be a grandma.

478
00:29:50,369 --> 00:29:52,075
Speaker 1: She 87 something.

479
00:29:52,075 --> 00:29:53,760
Speaker 0: 87 year old Japanese woman, right?

480
00:29:53,861 --> 00:29:55,027
Speaker 1: So I don't know if she's a grandma.

481
00:29:55,087 --> 00:30:02,360
Speaker 1: she might not have a husband or children or whatever But she's an 87 year old woman, and she works in a dumpling restaurant that her family owns.

482
00:30:02,541 --> 00:30:05,640
Speaker 1: She's working in a dumpling restaurant making dumplings for like 60 years.

483
00:30:06,022 --> 00:30:09,460
Speaker 1: So it's like you have 60 years of dumpling making practice.

484
00:30:09,661 --> 00:30:10,424
Speaker 1: I don't like.

485
00:30:10,464 --> 00:30:13,616
Speaker 1: those got to be fucking amazing dumplings right like holy shit.

486
00:30:13,636 --> 00:30:14,359
Speaker 1: That'll be good.

487
00:30:15,664 --> 00:30:19,384
Speaker 1: But like once a month She's awesome DJ.

488
00:30:19,725 --> 00:30:24,280
Speaker 1: She just decided to go to DJ school and now she DJs like a dumpling.

489
00:30:24,962 --> 00:30:30,460
Speaker 1: She DJs awesome beats like once in a while and everyone goes to these parties, and they're totally sick.

490
00:30:31,902 --> 00:30:33,730
Speaker 1: How grand it reminds me of the anime?

491
00:30:33,791 --> 00:30:34,313
Speaker 1: I watched.

492
00:30:34,735 --> 00:30:35,719
Speaker 1: where the tonkatsu DJ?

493
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,547
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, where the kid would he?

494
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:42,119
Speaker 1: his family owned a tonkatsu restaurant the one really racist character.

495
00:30:43,382 --> 00:30:48,824
Speaker 1: He was drawn in a somewhat racist way, but it wasn't really a racist portrayal I don't know.

496
00:30:48,904 --> 00:30:55,700
Speaker 1: ask a person who knows more about it than yeah But it was a cute show regardless even if it had that kind of problem, but he has about a kid.

497
00:30:56,062 --> 00:31:09,675
Speaker 1: He was like a teenager and his family owned a tonkatsu restaurant and he worked in it and then he would go DJ and he became a DJ discovered DJing and He would take you transfer his skills from the restaurant to the.

498
00:31:09,695 --> 00:31:11,140
Speaker 1: you know the dance parties.

499
00:31:13,143 --> 00:31:14,316
Speaker 1: So this reminded me of that.

500
00:31:14,336 --> 00:31:16,346
Speaker 1: it's like well It's a real thing I wonder.

501
00:31:16,386 --> 00:31:20,040
Speaker 1: I wonder if she saw that anime or read that manga and got the idea from it.

502
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,698
Speaker 0: I wonder how long she's been DJing cuz what if she's been DJing since like her 20s?

503
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,943
Speaker 1: No, it's only a few.

504
00:31:25,104 --> 00:31:28,880
Speaker 1: like she went to the DJ school like you know somewhat more recently like only a few years ago.

505
00:31:28,941 --> 00:31:31,863
Speaker 1: I think it says In the video.

506
00:31:31,904 --> 00:31:36,117
Speaker 0: it says the fact that the internet exists and like nerds continued a nerd into their older age.

507
00:31:36,197 --> 00:31:37,422
Speaker 0: like there might be A point.

508
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:41,140
Speaker 0: we're like we go to the penny arcade expo and we're super old dude.

509
00:31:41,441 --> 00:31:45,298
Speaker 0: Everyone stage is Mike and Jerry and they're both like 80.

510
00:31:45,298 --> 00:31:45,840
Speaker 1: They'll be dead.

511
00:31:48,422 --> 00:31:49,469
Speaker 0: Healthier life over time.

512
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:51,020
Speaker 0: I've noticed they look a lot healthy.

513
00:31:51,381 --> 00:31:55,153
Speaker 0: They look a lot healthier than they did 20 years ago say that yes, they're.

514
00:31:55,193 --> 00:32:00,536
Speaker 0: they're the the epitome of healthy Looking better than a lot of people who could send the conventions.

515
00:32:00,938 --> 00:32:06,299
Speaker 1: Yes They will outlive many attendees so not outlive us.

516
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:11,935
Speaker 0: So are you familiar with the gentleman by the name of Alec Guinness, yeah obi-wan Kenobi.

517
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:13,680
Speaker 1: we talked about Star Wars ten minutes ago.

518
00:32:13,841 --> 00:32:16,945
Speaker 0: yep, so, uh He's an easy notable.

519
00:32:16,985 --> 00:32:18,230
Speaker 0: He's notable for being what an actor.

520
00:32:18,671 --> 00:32:21,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, so he's been an actor for a long time.

521
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,126
Speaker 1: Well until he died.

522
00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:27,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he acted a lot of films Bridge over the River Kwai think I love.

523
00:32:27,128 --> 00:32:29,336
Speaker 0: so there is a trope that gets.

524
00:32:29,597 --> 00:32:30,360
Speaker 1: that was him, right?

525
00:32:31,481 --> 00:32:39,570
Speaker 0: There's a trope in movies where you'll have a gimmick where one Person plays a whole bunch of characters in the same movie.

526
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen that that's actually been a trope for a long long long time.

527
00:32:44,783 --> 00:32:46,253
Speaker 0: Alec Guinness did that in a movie once.

528
00:32:46,878 --> 00:32:47,120
Speaker 1: okay.

529
00:32:47,701 --> 00:32:55,820
Speaker 0: So, uh, what do you think is the total the highest number of characters that Alec Guinness personally played in a single?

530
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:56,301
Speaker 0: Film?

531
00:32:56,843 --> 00:32:57,627
Speaker 1: well, I mean it depends.

532
00:32:57,647 --> 00:33:00,780
Speaker 1: he playing like the side characters like the characters on screen for like two seconds.

533
00:33:00,821 --> 00:33:01,397
Speaker 1: Does that count?

534
00:33:02,042 --> 00:33:06,462
Speaker 1: Like someone walks into a store in the movie and buy something and walks out and he was the clerk Significance.

535
00:33:06,482 --> 00:33:08,871
Speaker 1: someone gets in a taxi for five minutes and he's the driver.

536
00:33:08,911 --> 00:33:16,340
Speaker 0: significant characters relevant to the plot Not the man not the protagonist like named characters named with dialogue and costumes.

537
00:33:16,681 --> 00:33:19,408
Speaker 1: Whoa in one movie in one log is the movie.

538
00:33:19,609 --> 00:33:24,963
Speaker 0: the movie is 106 minutes and it is from the year 1949.

539
00:33:24,963 --> 00:33:31,087
Speaker 1: and is it like a Movie or is it just like us?

540
00:33:31,228 --> 00:33:32,673
Speaker 0: I actually don't know shit about it.

541
00:33:32,774 --> 00:33:35,421
Speaker 0: All I know is it's a black comedy from 1949.

542
00:33:35,421 --> 00:33:38,955
Speaker 1: so it's a black comedy isn't something that's huge and opulent kind.

543
00:33:39,035 --> 00:33:42,768
Speaker 1: hearts and coronets That's a weird name that tells me nothing about it.

544
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:46,961
Speaker 1: I guess somewhere between like 10 and 20.

545
00:33:46,961 --> 00:33:47,984
Speaker 0: He didn't mine.

546
00:33:48,004 --> 00:33:53,200
Speaker 0: All right, he played the nine members of the das konye family.

547
00:33:54,161 --> 00:33:56,089
Speaker 0: Eight of them are major appearances.

548
00:33:56,109 --> 00:33:59,100
Speaker 0: Uh, but one of them don't appear on screen together.

549
00:33:59,722 --> 00:34:01,206
Speaker 0: I don't think they do okay.

550
00:34:01,427 --> 00:34:10,100
Speaker 0: Buster Keaton apparently also did this I learned recently and he did appear on screen with himself Which is fucking insane when you think about what that would have taken back in the day.

551
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,219
Speaker 1: I mean usually in a Buster Keaton movie, he's like almost the only character in the movie.

552
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:18,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know sort of the same thing is like a you know, Charlie Chaplin.

553
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:22,518
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like there's not really any other characters that there are but they're not there.

554
00:34:23,623 --> 00:34:29,560
Speaker 0: Those people where the more you learn about like you might know about him and be impressed just because you know Like he's important or whatever.

555
00:34:30,002 --> 00:34:34,820
Speaker 0: But literally every new thing you learn about him just impresses you more and that'll never stop as long as you learn about that.

556
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,061
Speaker 0: Dude,

557
00:34:35,202 --> 00:34:36,996
Speaker 1: because there aren't people like that anymore that

558
00:34:37,016 --> 00:34:46,857
Speaker 0: guy Well, he was an era where if you were smart and clever Like you could just pioneer in fields in crazy ways because no one had ever gone there before like and

559
00:34:46,877 --> 00:34:50,239
Speaker 1: you didn't have thinking you Didn't have internet and video games to spend on all day.

560
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,601
Speaker 1: So you can.

561
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:54,560
Speaker 1: instead you know, you're a hundred percent of your efforts were towards being the awesome.

562
00:34:55,088 --> 00:35:05,040
Speaker 0: But anyway My thing of the day is that I learned a lot about like all these topics together and it's all kind of Fascinating and I'll link to the Wikipedia article about kind of hearts and coronets.

563
00:35:05,421 --> 00:35:06,446
Speaker 0: You can see what the deal is.

564
00:35:06,948 --> 00:35:08,093
Speaker 0: kind of want to see this movie.

565
00:35:08,113 --> 00:35:12,127
Speaker 0: All right, why not cuz it's you know 1949 like old movie it is.

566
00:35:12,287 --> 00:35:13,130
Speaker 1: Is it on filmstruck?

567
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:14,654
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

568
00:35:14,855 --> 00:35:16,359
Speaker 1: Okay filmstruck is like the.

569
00:35:17,702 --> 00:35:20,560
Speaker 1: It's like they took the criterion collection off of Hulu.

570
00:35:21,329 --> 00:35:30,940
Speaker 1: So Then the filmstruck is like a website where you you know, it's a subscription where you can watch movies But it only has like the old highbrow movies from criterion collection and Turner classic movie.

571
00:35:31,341 --> 00:35:35,700
Speaker 0: All right, it did pretty well apparently and was nominated for a bunch of British Academy Awards.

572
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:39,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know it lost out to the third man.

573
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:42,680
Speaker 1: Well, the third man is like an all-time great movie like top ten movies.

574
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,826
Speaker 1: They never exist this.

575
00:35:44,027 --> 00:35:51,460
Speaker 0: so it think of this as the movie that that had Elegantness in it that lost out to the third man and I think it's like one of the best movies there ever is.

576
00:35:51,641 --> 00:35:52,947
Speaker 0: I don't think I've ever actually seen it.

577
00:35:53,772 --> 00:35:54,937
Speaker 1: You should see the third man.

578
00:35:54,978 --> 00:35:55,339
Speaker 0: I should.

579
00:35:56,641 --> 00:35:58,728
Speaker 0: It's like that's a you know, I just I haven't seen it.

580
00:35:59,069 --> 00:36:01,036
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you haven't played Zelda for the game boy.

581
00:36:01,136 --> 00:36:06,173
Speaker 0: There's yeah In the minute moment the booklet book is Frank Gerberts do now.

582
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,600
Speaker 1: I haven't even read one page.

583
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:12,566
Speaker 0: I'm not even gonna touch it until I finish Zelda and There's a lot going on in Zelda.

584
00:36:12,586 --> 00:36:13,810
Speaker 0: So I gotta do some bowling.

585
00:36:13,830 --> 00:36:19,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Found some interesting areas and some stuff.

586
00:36:20,161 --> 00:36:24,640
Speaker 0: So now I found the the other lab where you can get ancient armor and stuff.

587
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:26,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to get rupees for.

588
00:36:26,268 --> 00:36:27,855
Speaker 1: I just need a few more gears.

589
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:28,820
Speaker 1: I got all the other parts.

590
00:36:28,861 --> 00:36:29,599
Speaker 1: I need you more gears.

591
00:36:29,821 --> 00:36:34,680
Speaker 0: I feel like I could just kill the people in that place and run the machine myself and make the armor without giving them.

592
00:36:35,703 --> 00:36:37,128
Speaker 1: Except you don't have to give them the rupees.

593
00:36:37,168 --> 00:36:38,513
Speaker 1: the machine wants the roof.

594
00:36:38,553 --> 00:36:38,954
Speaker 0: Damn it.

595
00:36:39,315 --> 00:36:40,680
Speaker 0: Why does the machine want the rupees?

596
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:42,127
Speaker 0: Why do the fairies want rupees?

597
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:44,700
Speaker 1: the miss you talk to the machine and it says give me this many rupees.

598
00:36:45,564 --> 00:36:46,388
Speaker 0: Why do you need the rupees?

599
00:36:46,428 --> 00:36:47,513
Speaker 0: I'm trying to save the world here.

600
00:36:47,794 --> 00:36:48,980
Speaker 1: because oh, that's true.

601
00:36:49,201 --> 00:36:52,520
Speaker 1: I mean, that's one thing that's always been here is like why are people not helping the guy?

602
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,222
Speaker 0: Well, it's the.

603
00:36:53,282 --> 00:37:01,259
Speaker 1: once you have the master store people should believe that you're the hero and if they're truly anti-ganon They just give you all their arrows and give you everything rights to help you.

604
00:37:01,681 --> 00:37:05,755
Speaker 1: But it is good we did mention it is good that rupees actually matter in this game.

605
00:37:05,815 --> 00:37:09,225
Speaker 0: I'm sure every other Zelda true But I did that quest thinking.

606
00:37:09,245 --> 00:37:11,993
Speaker 0: Oh if I power this thing up, I'll get some awesome stuff.

607
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:14,180
Speaker 1: It's like no now I can spend.

608
00:37:16,706 --> 00:37:19,099
Speaker 1: You need a lot of gears and springs and shafts.

609
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:22,976
Speaker 0: I have a lot of the actually everything I need except the money really.

610
00:37:22,996 --> 00:37:23,257
Speaker 1: Yeah.

611
00:37:23,498 --> 00:37:25,392
Speaker 1: Oh, wow Where'd you get all this?

612
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:26,239
Speaker 0: a lot of places?

613
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:30,860
Speaker 1: So one place I was only able to get enough of them by like actually fighting ancient guardian type.

614
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,509
Speaker 0: So, you know that be the big square labyrinth like.

615
00:37:33,549 --> 00:37:34,813
Speaker 0: apparently that's the heart labyrinth.

616
00:37:34,893 --> 00:37:37,765
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the area under it Graveyard.

617
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:38,168
Speaker 0: Yeah.

618
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:38,994
Speaker 0: Yeah down there.

619
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:39,920
Speaker 0: You can get a lot of that stuff.

620
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:40,647
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I had to fight.

621
00:37:40,667 --> 00:37:41,960
Speaker 1: there were ancients that are alive.

622
00:37:43,242 --> 00:37:45,671
Speaker 0: I looted them all before I open the chest in the center.

623
00:37:46,214 --> 00:37:47,479
Speaker 0: They don't activate until you touch that.

624
00:37:47,519 --> 00:37:50,837
Speaker 1: Yeah I did that too, but there's still some alive ones.

625
00:37:51,118 --> 00:37:59,773
Speaker 1: Yeah But I can actually take on them now because I know how to parry their lasers But it's still tough and annoying and I can't do too many at once.

626
00:37:59,993 --> 00:38:01,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least the scouts aren't scary anymore.

627
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,070
Speaker 0: I can just kill them like not even think of the flying ones.

628
00:38:04,693 --> 00:38:05,537
Speaker 0: No the little guys.

629
00:38:05,899 --> 00:38:06,644
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah No, those are.

630
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:07,793
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the flying guys.

631
00:38:07,813 --> 00:38:08,680
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do about that.

632
00:38:09,002 --> 00:38:09,848
Speaker 0: You know what I do about those.

633
00:38:09,948 --> 00:38:11,036
Speaker 0: I hide from them.

634
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:14,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay I think you can shoot the propellers or something.

635
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,434
Speaker 1: Yeah, but them come the one.

636
00:38:15,454 --> 00:38:17,146
Speaker 0: so I tried that once I was like You know what?

637
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:17,840
Speaker 0: I'll take these guys.

638
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,969
Speaker 1: I can also parry their laser which is what I know.

639
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:20,773
Speaker 1: I learned how to do.

640
00:38:20,833 --> 00:38:22,400
Speaker 1: but if you mess up like you lose your shield.

641
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:24,952
Speaker 1: So it's like you run out of shields if you're not really good at it.

642
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:26,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, bring ten shield.

643
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:30,240
Speaker 1: Anyway, ten times other meta things are making more videos lately.

644
00:38:30,381 --> 00:38:31,484
Speaker 0: So a lot more videos.

645
00:38:31,525 --> 00:38:37,267
Speaker 1: the YouTube finally added the live stream directly from your phone feature The sometime between.

646
00:38:37,347 --> 00:38:43,220
Speaker 1: I was wanted to do it last year when I was doing lunch with Scott But they didn't have the feature yet for everybody and then it got cold.

647
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:45,727
Speaker 1: So I stopped doing it and now they added the feature.

648
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:50,420
Speaker 1: So today I tested it out and I made Scott live, right?

649
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,147
Speaker 1: So Scott live is now a thing.

650
00:38:52,650 --> 00:38:55,523
Speaker 1: So I guess whenever I feel like it I will.

651
00:38:55,825 --> 00:38:58,759
Speaker 1: uh, you know, I could just turn on my phone and stream something like BAM.

652
00:38:59,282 --> 00:39:01,500
Speaker 0: I stream overwatch sometimes when I'm playing but

653
00:39:02,541 --> 00:39:04,608
Speaker 1: Even Zelda to like whenever I play streaming

654
00:39:04,648 --> 00:39:19,380
Speaker 0: this every episode of gig nights that I feel like I'll just sometimes turn on the string Streaming rig actually set up the old compressor to make the audio for the stream better because I don't have like a Live signal processing pipeline because I haven't needed it because we do everything in post.

655
00:39:19,762 --> 00:39:20,969
Speaker 0: So I actually had to set up like.

656
00:39:21,009 --> 00:39:26,236
Speaker 0: live streaming brings back the concerns We used to have in like ten years ago geek nights.

657
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:26,960
Speaker 0: in terms of audio.

658
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,995
Speaker 1: I see you can subscribe or to our youtubes or follow us on Twitter's.

659
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:37,580
Speaker 1: subscribe to both of us because Split on my new account automatically tweets when I could go live or whatever.

660
00:39:37,761 --> 00:39:39,306
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's how it works.

661
00:39:39,767 --> 00:39:41,453
Speaker 0: and more video stuff is coming.

662
00:39:41,593 --> 00:39:43,620
Speaker 0: A lot of you keep asking me recently about the utenna show.

663
00:39:44,422 --> 00:39:44,986
Speaker 0: It's coming.

664
00:39:45,087 --> 00:39:46,740
Speaker 0: I've just been busy with a lot of other stuff.

665
00:39:47,081 --> 00:39:55,087
Speaker 0: We do have a pipeline and what we should be able to once we really start cranking it crank out those utenna videos Mostly right now.

666
00:39:55,127 --> 00:40:10,788
Speaker 0: I'm modifying the pipeline to Try to do some stuff to avoid the copyright stuff because frankly the copyright stuff in that whose tennis show was so bad That if it continues even after I try to avoid it might just not continue because Almost every anime thing we've ever put up like

667
00:40:11,069 --> 00:40:11,370
Speaker 1: three.

668
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:12,716
Speaker 1: I just put it on not YouTube.

669
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:13,740
Speaker 0: That's pain in the ass.

670
00:40:13,801 --> 00:40:14,652
Speaker 0: I don't care enough to do it.

671
00:40:14,753 --> 00:40:15,300
Speaker 0: I just won't bother.

672
00:40:15,561 --> 00:40:20,020
Speaker 0: Okay, like I'm putting all my stuff on YouTube and if I can't put it on YouTube, I just don't care.

673
00:40:20,361 --> 00:40:22,171
Speaker 1: So I don't like Vimeo or something.

674
00:40:22,191 --> 00:40:23,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, Vimeo is pain in the ass.

675
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:23,980
Speaker 0: Don't want to bother?

676
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:24,919
Speaker 1: How is it a pain in the ass?

677
00:40:26,044 --> 00:40:26,918
Speaker 0: Take down notices.

678
00:40:28,120 --> 00:40:29,810
Speaker 0: Like stuff just lasts there longer.

679
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:30,353
Speaker 0: a lot of people.

680
00:40:30,373 --> 00:40:34,560
Speaker 0: what they do is they put it up on Vimeo And when it eventually gets taken down, they just put it up on Vimeo again.

681
00:40:35,124 --> 00:40:37,000
Speaker 0: I'm not playing that game and I'm playing whack-a-mole.

682
00:40:37,331 --> 00:40:42,760
Speaker 1: No But I mean, you know Maybe you won't get taken down because Vimeo will actually respect like oh this is a fair use.

683
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:52,817
Speaker 0: No Vimeo has nothing to do with it because it's even if I go through the motions the companies Usually send me counter notices and I got to go through like danger of suing paper.

684
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:53,318
Speaker 1: All right, good.

685
00:40:53,338 --> 00:40:53,760
Speaker 1: Bring it on.

686
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:55,406
Speaker 0: You're gonna pay for the lawyer.

687
00:40:55,426 --> 00:40:56,251
Speaker 1: No, let them.

688
00:40:56,452 --> 00:40:57,417
Speaker 1: they won't actually bring it on.

689
00:40:57,437 --> 00:40:57,859
Speaker 1: They don't dare.

690
00:40:58,624 --> 00:41:00,072
Speaker 0: Do you gonna pay for the lawyer?

691
00:41:00,092 --> 00:41:01,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll just I'll do it.

692
00:41:01,581 --> 00:41:03,560
Speaker 1: I'll just grab on to them and set myself a fire.

693
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:08,538
Speaker 0: Well, you sign a contract with me that if one of those videos lawyers that we will 50/50 deal with it.

694
00:41:09,281 --> 00:41:11,234
Speaker 1: I think we had to be sure that we're fair usage.

695
00:41:11,254 --> 00:41:11,979
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure we are.

696
00:41:12,521 --> 00:41:20,552
Speaker 0: And so fair use that's already a problem because fair use actually to use fair use in court You basically have to say and by the way, I'm not a lawyer.

697
00:41:20,593 --> 00:41:21,477
Speaker 0: That's not legal advice.

698
00:41:21,899 --> 00:41:24,069
Speaker 0: Yes I violated this copyright.

699
00:41:24,089 --> 00:41:30,392
Speaker 0: you have to admit guilt and then argue That the there shouldn't be any punishment because of fair use.

700
00:41:30,713 --> 00:41:32,780
Speaker 0: it's real dangerous to go down that road.

701
00:41:32,901 --> 00:41:34,980
Speaker 1: I could just argue that I didn't violate the copyright first.

702
00:41:35,020 --> 00:41:37,939
Speaker 0: They know that that that'll be double the cost of the lawyers.

703
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:43,360
Speaker 1: Yeah Because that you know what their response will be gonna find someone who's really wants to fix fair use in the country.

704
00:41:43,500 --> 00:41:44,284
Speaker 1: Who's gonna fight for?

705
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:48,980
Speaker 0: if one of you is a lawyer and wants to be our lawyer on retainer I think about it.

706
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:53,600
Speaker 1: If you were the lawyer who finally got fair use fixed after all this time, right?

707
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:55,332
Speaker 1: You'd be like a hero for the ages, right?

708
00:41:55,593 --> 00:42:02,253
Speaker 1: We will be your case if you Want to be that hero to save the whole world from copyright.

709
00:42:02,313 --> 00:42:05,485
Speaker 0: if you would be willing to be our lawyer and you're good We would literally.

710
00:42:05,586 --> 00:42:08,280
Speaker 0: we would be willing to be the case a hundred percent.

711
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:13,386
Speaker 1: We'd also give you the money we can afford to give you which is not insignificant But it's probably not what you used to make.

712
00:42:13,567 --> 00:42:16,356
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could not pay you and continue to live my life.

713
00:42:16,437 --> 00:42:20,320
Speaker 1: Probably no No, but now you would get from like a big company for the same case.

714
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:25,758
Speaker 0: It can't be like it's always sunny in Philadelphia where they just break into that one lawyer's office all the time and he gives them Advice just so they'll go away.

715
00:42:27,661 --> 00:42:29,507
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, uh chocolate.

716
00:42:29,848 --> 00:42:34,043
Speaker 0: All right, uh at the end of the month Saturday the 29th Sunday the 30th I will be live at zinc.

717
00:42:34,084 --> 00:42:38,219

719
00:42:41,417 --> 00:42:43,246
Speaker 1: All right No one's gonna go to.

720
00:42:43,266 --> 00:42:46,260
Speaker 0: a lot of people go to it's actually it's a bit shockingly big.

721
00:42:46,621 --> 00:42:55,794
Speaker 0: Yeah, like way big and actually my panels cuz I go over here after you stop going, uh, Usually fill completely with it like way more cuz nothing else to do there.

722
00:42:55,995 --> 00:42:57,159
Speaker 0: There's actually a lot to do there.

723
00:42:58,421 --> 00:42:59,685
Speaker 0: There's more to do there Scott.

724
00:42:59,705 --> 00:43:07,090
Speaker 0: There's more for us to do at this con than it anime Boston Mmm, maybe just cuz people you know are there with board games.

725
00:43:07,150 --> 00:43:08,736
Speaker 1: No, because what if those in anime con?

726
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,650
Speaker 0: It's never think on like kinetic on sure.

727
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,460
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of non anime content.

728
00:43:14,241 --> 00:43:16,651
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't know why you're so down on this convention.

729
00:43:16,691 --> 00:43:18,117
Speaker 1: It's a pain in the ass to go there.

730
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:18,720
Speaker 0: Hey, you don't go.

731
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:21,393
Speaker 0: Yeah, I go what I have a good time.

732
00:43:21,413 --> 00:43:25,829
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, so chocolate is a delicious thing.

733
00:43:25,849 --> 00:43:29,642
Speaker 1: And if you don't like chocolate, which I know some people don't I don't know What's wrong?

734
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:31,346
Speaker 1: You're a heathen with a broken tongue.

735
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:34,134
Speaker 1: go to the doctor get your tongue fixed something wrong with you.

736
00:43:34,275 --> 00:43:34,555
Speaker 0: Yep.

737
00:43:35,097 --> 00:43:37,689
Speaker 0: So, uh chocolate Is something.

738
00:43:37,710 --> 00:43:38,399
Speaker 0: when I was a kid?

739
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:43,895
Speaker 0: I actually for most of my childhood was obsessed with white chocolate and didn't like like.

740
00:43:44,216 --> 00:43:47,386
Speaker 0: I enjoyed regular chocolate But it always felt like inferior.

741
00:43:47,426 --> 00:43:51,740
Speaker 0: I had this idea in my head that white chocolate whatever that was cuz it's a kid.

742
00:43:51,781 --> 00:43:52,680
Speaker 0: I didn't know what the hell it was.

743
00:43:52,740 --> 00:44:05,472
Speaker 0: I just I knew there was chocolate and white chocolate and I knew From going to a chocolatier at like a resort one time that the white chocolate at that place Happened to cost like four times more than the regular chocolate.

744
00:44:05,492 --> 00:44:08,849
Speaker 0: my chocolate does taste better my chocolate is delicious But is it really chocolate?

745
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:10,040
Speaker 1: I don't know really.

746
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:14,062
Speaker 1: I don't really give a shit but it tastes better than regular chocolate and it has the same Sort of.

747
00:44:14,122 --> 00:44:18,140
Speaker 1: you can use it for the same functions as regular chocolate because you know, you can melt it down.

748
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:22,336
Speaker 1: It comes in a form of a bar, you know, the texture is similar, right?

749
00:44:22,617 --> 00:44:26,920
Speaker 0: So it's like sure Yeah, why chocolate is chocolate except there's no cocoa in it, right?

750
00:44:27,321 --> 00:44:33,139
Speaker 1: So it's like even though it's very similar to actual chocolate it is a chocolate derivative.

751
00:44:33,339 --> 00:44:34,021
Speaker 1: sure It's.

752
00:44:34,322 --> 00:44:35,225
Speaker 1: it still tastes better.

753
00:44:35,626 --> 00:44:40,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, so the thing with chocolate right is like people when they talk about chocolate.

754
00:44:40,641 --> 00:44:40,883
Speaker 1: I don't.

755
00:44:41,044 --> 00:44:42,899
Speaker 1: actually don't know a ton about chocolate.

756
00:44:43,482 --> 00:44:49,989
Speaker 1: I'm not like a chocolate expert by any means but you know, obviously There's fancy chocolate right.

757
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:52,920
Speaker 1: that tastes better than Hershey's chocolate.

758
00:44:53,462 --> 00:44:54,787
Speaker 1: This is not something did you know?

759
00:44:54,807 --> 00:44:55,349
Speaker 1: if you go to the?

760
00:44:55,389 --> 00:45:00,947
Speaker 0: well so we should really tear it already because Hershey's is like the baseline Default chocolate.

761
00:45:00,968 --> 00:45:02,420
Speaker 1: Well, that's like the cheapest crappiest chocolate.

762
00:45:04,961 --> 00:45:07,368
Speaker 1: It's cheaper and crappier than here is there.

763
00:45:07,388 --> 00:45:11,040
Speaker 0: there are depths of crappy chocolate below Hershey's.

764
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,123
Speaker 1: What are they for?

765
00:45:12,304 --> 00:45:19,916
Speaker 0: So the chocolate in most of those super cheap Japanese and Chinese like sweets we get Oh, you mean like the chocolate in the middle of a koala?

766
00:45:19,996 --> 00:45:21,663
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay There are.

767
00:45:21,723 --> 00:45:25,476
Speaker 1: there are tiers of chocolate like the chocolate that a crappy Easter Bunny is made out of.

768
00:45:25,716 --> 00:45:32,340
Speaker 0: go to the off-brand Grocery store in a bad part of a depressed town and there's gonna be some off-brand chocolate.

769
00:45:32,541 --> 00:45:36,053
Speaker 1: Chocolate is already like a slightly, you know, this you have to make it like.

770
00:45:36,093 --> 00:45:38,240
Speaker 1: who's putting the effort to make bad chocolate?

771
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:39,770
Speaker 1: You might as well make it at least her.

772
00:45:39,790 --> 00:45:41,440
Speaker 1: she's gonna make chocolate at all.

773
00:45:41,460 --> 00:45:47,422
Speaker 0: What about things that are only chocolate at chocolate esque, but are not Technically chocolate?

774
00:45:47,442 --> 00:45:51,527
Speaker 0: you mean things disgusting like coffee, uh, that's a totally different class of things.

775
00:45:51,828 --> 00:45:53,390
Speaker 1: I'm saying it's it's chocolate esque.

776
00:45:54,221 --> 00:45:56,790
Speaker 0: I would not argue that coffee is chocolate esque.

777
00:45:57,091 --> 00:45:59,118
Speaker 1: No, no, it's brown food.

778
00:45:59,198 --> 00:45:59,539
Speaker 0: mix it.

779
00:45:59,961 --> 00:46:02,916
Speaker 0: You're going brown food then poops on the spectrum you poop.

780
00:46:03,097 --> 00:46:16,487
Speaker 0: Okay Riven mitts eating food But let's just say that Hershey Hershey's is the baseline in that If I'm presented with Hershey's I'll pretty much just eat it, right It's like there's a lot of people.

781
00:46:16,527 --> 00:46:20,386
Speaker 1: or it's like yeah, I agree with you The Hershey's is nowhere near as good as like that.

782
00:46:20,426 --> 00:46:26,182
Speaker 1: Haha fancy chocolate, right, you know, but it still tastes good Right.

783
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:28,211
Speaker 1: It's like I was just telling rim before.

784
00:46:28,231 --> 00:46:35,760
Speaker 1: it's like hey, we're making a basketball team You know for like pickup basketball and someone shows up right and they're an NBA player.

785
00:46:36,402 --> 00:46:41,260
Speaker 1: But there's a no-name NBA player who sits on the bench of the worst team in the league, right?

786
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:43,593
Speaker 1: And gets paid only like a few hundred thousand dollars.

787
00:46:43,654 --> 00:46:44,720
Speaker 1: Not even a million dollars.

788
00:46:45,424 --> 00:46:46,429
Speaker 1: Whatever the minimum is.

789
00:46:46,449 --> 00:46:48,500
Speaker 1: you're allowed to play an NBA player in that Union.

790
00:46:48,821 --> 00:46:51,828
Speaker 1: They're getting it paid and they play like one minute a year or whatever.

791
00:46:51,868 --> 00:46:55,486
Speaker 1: right there that guy That's still an NBA player.

792
00:46:55,686 --> 00:46:59,820
Speaker 1: you get them on your pickup team down at the playground and you're gonna kill it, right?

793
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:01,043
Speaker 1: And that's what Hershey's is.

794
00:47:01,103 --> 00:47:03,210
Speaker 1: It's like it's still chocolate.

795
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,660
Speaker 1: It died as good as any of the other chocolates, right?

796
00:47:06,821 --> 00:47:08,940
Speaker 1: It's not gonna win any chocolate taste contest.

797
00:47:09,763 --> 00:47:12,071
Speaker 1: It's still gonna win the pickup basketball game, right?

798
00:47:12,111 --> 00:47:12,754
Speaker 1: It's still good.

799
00:47:12,774 --> 00:47:14,460
Speaker 1: I still eat it, right?

800
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:15,727
Speaker 1: It's easy to get huh?

801
00:47:15,767 --> 00:47:20,854
Speaker 0: So milk chocolate like that kind of chocolate Which is you know, most chocolate that most Americans eat.

802
00:47:21,014 --> 00:47:21,778
Speaker 0: Yes, no chocolate.

803
00:47:21,979 --> 00:47:25,795
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Like actually non milk chocolate is pretty rare.

804
00:47:25,876 --> 00:47:32,720
Speaker 1: unless you're a baker You got a specialty places right and baking like if you actually get baking chocolate don't really eat that.

805
00:47:32,921 --> 00:47:38,763
Speaker 0: well, I mean I kind of like that kind of chocolate sure but that is Enjoying.

806
00:47:38,823 --> 00:47:41,660
Speaker 0: that is like enjoying an ultra hoppy beer, right?

807
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:46,520
Speaker 1: It's like dark chocolate and you can go to the store and you can buy dark chocolate, which tastes great.

808
00:47:46,701 --> 00:47:47,263
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

809
00:47:47,383 --> 00:47:52,180
Speaker 1: But if you go to the baking aisle, they have like bars of chocolate that are like this is baking chocolate.

810
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:57,840
Speaker 1: It is meant for like melting or you know, putting into a chocolate cake and it's meant for that.

811
00:47:58,201 --> 00:48:00,712
Speaker 1: It's not meant for eating and it doesn't taste.

812
00:48:00,954 --> 00:48:02,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's dark chocolate.

813
00:48:02,159 --> 00:48:06,336
Speaker 1: Sure It doesn't taste good the way the bar of dark chocolate you get in the other area.

814
00:48:06,456 --> 00:48:07,260
Speaker 1: It tastes good.

815
00:48:07,840 --> 00:48:11,133
Speaker 0: But apparently milk chocolate wasn't actually invented until 1875.

816
00:48:11,133 --> 00:48:17,317
Speaker 0: That's still a long time ago Yeah, but it's also surprisingly or not surprisingly at least shockingly recent.

817
00:48:17,337 --> 00:48:20,344
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Well, when was regular chocolate invented?

818
00:48:20,866 --> 00:48:36,582
Speaker 0: Well invented it's grown on the planet since I remember but it wasn't in chocolate bar form You know, it was consumed in bean form in forms that you would recognize today like basically cocoa beverages as early as 1900 BCE.

819
00:48:38,647 --> 00:48:39,356
Speaker 1: What what?

820
00:48:40,622 --> 00:48:42,348
Speaker 0: You don't know anything about Mesoamerican chocolate.

821
00:48:42,408 --> 00:48:42,609
Speaker 0: I don't.

822
00:48:42,689 --> 00:48:44,035
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the Wikipedia.

823
00:48:44,195 --> 00:48:49,779
Speaker 0: That's why you that's why you know You're looking at more well-informed than I ought to be because I'm looking at this.

824
00:48:50,201 --> 00:48:54,640
Speaker 0: But I knew that Mesoamerica had chocolate long long long ago.

825
00:48:54,760 --> 00:49:00,180
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean I thought I thought I knew people were eating cocoa beans from you know trees.

826
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,879
Speaker 1: I didn't realize people were able to turn it into like a chocolate bar chocolate beverages at least.

827
00:49:05,401 --> 00:49:06,384
Speaker 0: But what about a son thing?

828
00:49:06,404 --> 00:49:07,267
Speaker 1: What about a bar?

829
00:49:07,628 --> 00:49:11,720
Speaker 1: Well, so there's different kind like a solid chocolate is I'm talking about?

830
00:49:11,841 --> 00:49:14,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, there's different kinds of solid chocolate.

831
00:49:14,341 --> 00:49:22,490
Speaker 0: But let's see the moldable chocolate in the form that you think of today was invented basically by adding melted cocoa butter Mm-hmm.

832
00:49:22,735 --> 00:49:25,600
Speaker 0: That was 1847 the year before they invented milk chocolate.

833
00:49:25,849 --> 00:49:27,605
Speaker 1: Okay So the milk was like.

834
00:49:27,866 --> 00:49:30,454
Speaker 1: they figured out the bar and they added the milk in the next year and

835
00:49:30,976 --> 00:49:43,386
Speaker 0: apparently they started making it Bitter in the early 1800s, but it seems like what happened was Europeans with their evil colonialism Stole chocolate brought it back to Europe and we're like, ah, this stuff's actually better We don't like it that much.

836
00:49:43,729 --> 00:49:50,906
Speaker 0: and then they spent a hundred years Making it less and less bitter and more and more milky and sweet Mmm, and that's where.

837
00:49:51,026 --> 00:49:53,954
Speaker 1: and now they're making it bitter again because they realize they fucked up.

838
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:54,375
Speaker 1: Yep.

839
00:49:54,696 --> 00:49:55,879
Speaker 0: They learned their lesson, I think.

840
00:49:57,842 --> 00:50:04,780
Speaker 0: In 1662 the Bishop of Rome declared that religious fasts were not technically broken by consuming chocolate.

841
00:50:05,981 --> 00:50:09,117
Speaker 1: Sounds like sounds like a Caesar wanted to get his chocolate on.

842
00:50:09,157 --> 00:50:12,786
Speaker 1: Yeah So Rome had chocolate.

843
00:50:12,806 --> 00:50:15,656
Speaker 0: - damn well Scott Rome exists today.

844
00:50:15,937 --> 00:50:21,672
Speaker 0: the Bishop of Rome Has existed for many many many hundreds of years.

845
00:50:22,234 --> 00:50:22,534
Speaker 0: This was 1662.

846
00:50:22,534 --> 00:50:29,635
Speaker 0: Okay In fact, there weren't bishops of Rome until I thought you said Christianity.

847
00:50:29,655 --> 00:50:31,160
Speaker 1: I didn't realize you said Bishop of Rome.

848
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:32,500
Speaker 1: I thought you're talking about the Caesar.

849
00:50:33,161 --> 00:50:36,839
Speaker 1: That's why I said Caesar before but I guess the Bishop of Rome is an entirely different person.

850
00:50:37,544 --> 00:50:39,079
Speaker 0: But uh, yeah chocolate is super good.

851
00:50:39,461 --> 00:50:41,167
Speaker 0: So what are your favorite uses of like?

852
00:50:41,187 --> 00:50:42,833
Speaker 0: what's your favorite if you like?

853
00:50:42,874 --> 00:50:44,600
Speaker 0: if you could get any kind of chocolate right now?

854
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:49,795
Speaker 0: Literally right now in front of you regardless of cost or expense or difficulty.

855
00:50:50,357 --> 00:50:51,160
Speaker 0: What is your chocolate?

856
00:50:51,342 --> 00:51:00,085
Speaker 1: Well, I mean if I could get any chocolate I want to try the ridiculously expensive fancy chocolate that I can't afford that I want to like from a Custom chocolate.

857
00:51:00,146 --> 00:51:00,828
Speaker 1: I want to see.

858
00:51:00,948 --> 00:51:04,500
Speaker 1: I want to see like is that is the fanciest God chocolate on earth?

859
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:07,410
Speaker 1: Whatever the hell it is right actually any good?

860
00:51:07,491 --> 00:51:12,536
Speaker 1: or is it just as good as the Moderately expensive semi fancy chocolate that I can buy easily.

861
00:51:12,556 --> 00:51:13,440
Speaker 0: All right, here it is.

862
00:51:14,942 --> 00:51:20,475
Speaker 0: Amadei Porchilana is a dark chocolate made by the Amadei chocolatier in Tuscany.

863
00:51:20,716 --> 00:51:24,308
Speaker 1: Yeah, it sounds that sounds about the level I want to get one the golden bean award.

864
00:51:24,328 --> 00:51:25,934
Speaker 0: I mean that's bean to bar.

865
00:51:25,954 --> 00:51:27,380
Speaker 1: That's probably good enough, right?

866
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:31,440
Speaker 1: There might be something out there that's even fancier, but that that might as well be it right.

867
00:51:31,801 --> 00:51:34,549
Speaker 1: Is that better than the fanciest chocolate bar?

868
00:51:34,629 --> 00:51:37,758
Speaker 0: special translucent white cocoa bean variety?

869
00:51:37,778 --> 00:51:43,500
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah It seems to be in the style of Mexican or Colombian.

870
00:51:44,343 --> 00:51:45,131
Speaker 1: It's a real chocolate.

871
00:51:45,171 --> 00:51:48,348
Speaker 0: All right, so oh This isn't that expensive.

872
00:51:48,429 --> 00:51:49,012
Speaker 1: how much is it?

873
00:51:49,012 --> 00:51:49,434
Speaker 1: $90 a pound?

00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:51,843
Speaker 1: Buy some.

875
00:51:52,084 --> 00:51:53,895
Speaker 0: I could like go on Amazon.

876
00:51:53,915 --> 00:51:54,459
Speaker 1: See if you can get it.

877
00:51:54,981 --> 00:51:57,990
Speaker 0: I've spent way more money on dumber shit than that.

878
00:51:58,050 --> 00:51:59,394
Speaker 1: You can make a video where we get the.

879
00:51:59,554 --> 00:52:04,087
Speaker 1: I'll spend the patreon money Then the patreon money by.

880
00:52:04,287 --> 00:52:05,090
Speaker 1: don't buy just that.

881
00:52:05,471 --> 00:52:09,582
Speaker 1: by the three fanciest chocolates we can get or five or whatever The number is.

882
00:52:09,622 --> 00:52:14,140
Speaker 0: I don't know if this is actually the fanciest but I typed fans most expensive chocolate and that's what came.

883
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:18,520
Speaker 1: Why don't we go to YouTube and see if anyone has already made this video where they try the fanciest truck them?

884
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:19,824
Speaker 0: I want an excuse to make the video.

885
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:20,828
Speaker 1: I also do too.

886
00:52:20,908 --> 00:52:24,000
Speaker 0: But yeah, all these other fancy chocolates are bullshit in that.

887
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:26,354
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a truffle in it like a real truck.

888
00:52:26,414 --> 00:52:27,038
Speaker 1: Oh get that one.

889
00:52:28,282 --> 00:52:29,088
Speaker 0: So yeah, you know what?

890
00:52:29,128 --> 00:52:29,732
Speaker 0: I want Scott.

891
00:52:30,135 --> 00:52:35,070
Speaker 0: I want a Vintage Maserati that has a chocolate bar in the seat.

892
00:52:35,371 --> 00:52:38,160
Speaker 1: one actual truffle is not as expensive as a Maserati.

893
00:52:38,220 --> 00:52:40,516
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying if you I can just include anything in.

894
00:52:40,536 --> 00:52:44,568
Speaker 1: the chocolate Right is like one.

895
00:52:44,588 --> 00:52:48,838
Speaker 1: some, you know, there are clearly subtle differences between like fancy chocolates.

896
00:52:48,858 --> 00:52:49,620
Speaker 1: I've had quite a few.

897
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:53,160
Speaker 1: There's like ones that are nuttier and ones that are more dark and less dark.

898
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:58,940
Speaker 1: You know got the 85% dark, you know, go and whatever and they're all pretty good and different in their own ways.

899
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:06,300
Speaker 1: But actually, you know Heathen me or whatever right my favorite chocolates have to do with what's when you put stuff in them.

900
00:53:06,320 --> 00:53:11,785
Speaker 1: That's not chocolate right like a sea salt caramel filled Without with almond.

901
00:53:12,006 --> 00:53:12,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

902
00:53:12,748 --> 00:53:14,875
Speaker 1: that's the pretty much the maximum sea salt.

903
00:53:15,256 --> 00:53:16,460
Speaker 0: I really like orange peel.

904
00:53:16,782 --> 00:53:24,877
Speaker 1: I really like when there's a mint cream in the chocolate like Andy's candies is obviously like the cheapo version but like this Ritter sport.

905
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:29,340
Speaker 1: It's a Ritter sport I don't know if you know, this is called Ritter sport because it comes in a square.

906
00:53:29,662 --> 00:53:31,675
Speaker 1: They are supposed to put in your sport coat pocket.

907
00:53:31,735 --> 00:53:44,352
Speaker 1: It fits in there Okay, but they make like a zillion flavors and they usually charge like, you know in the city depending on where you go These things could be five dollars a bar But you can get them for 250 or even two dollars a bar.

908
00:53:44,392 --> 00:54:09,248
Speaker 1: and if I see that I buy them and they have the Pfefferman's variety which is This basically mint cream inside of it and the second best variety is the choco duo Which is part of its white chocolate and part of its regular chocolate And they have a ton of different varieties though that like, you know, like I think it's like 50 something different kinds you know like pralines and you know Every nougats and all kinds of stuff.

909
00:54:09,469 --> 00:54:11,980
Speaker 0: one thing I will say because I know I don't know if we've talked about this on geek knives.

910
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:16,274
Speaker 0: We probably did a long time ago, but we learned this a long time ago in case you didn't know.

911
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:23,640
Speaker 0: unless you Go out of your way and know enough to avoid it Chocolate ice cream is bullshit.

912
00:54:24,081 --> 00:54:38,100
Speaker 0: yeah, it's basically all the it's crappy or leftover ice cream or other flavors or nonsense and they put some chocolate flavoring in it because Chocolate flavor just like hacks the brain and if you add chocolate to things it pretty much makes it taste like chocolate.

913
00:54:38,824 --> 00:54:41,420
Speaker 0: So and then they just put some brown food coloring in it.

914
00:54:41,500 --> 00:54:42,548
Speaker 0: You know the difference right?

915
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:48,160
Speaker 1: if you want to get actual chocolate I forget a chocolate milkshake unless they're melting chocolate syrup into it, right?

916
00:54:48,321 --> 00:54:51,460
Speaker 1: Well, or just if you do it yourself with you bet no you get the black and white shake.

917
00:54:51,500 --> 00:54:54,752
Speaker 0: That's actually a vanilla shake, but then there's just melted chocolate mixed in.

918
00:54:54,852 --> 00:55:00,143
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh of anyway, so the Was I just saying?

919
00:55:00,163 --> 00:55:00,785
Speaker 1: you messed me up.

920
00:55:01,648 --> 00:55:03,353
Speaker 0: I was talking about chocolate ice cream.

921
00:55:03,453 --> 00:55:03,774
Speaker 1: All right.

922
00:55:03,814 --> 00:55:05,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, you were talking about the Ritter sport, right?

923
00:55:05,740 --> 00:55:09,574
Speaker 1: I was gonna say you can go and find fancy chocolate ice cream.

924
00:55:09,594 --> 00:55:11,060
Speaker 1: That is real chocolate in it, right?

925
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,400
Speaker 1: It's the expensive stuff at the grocery store and not the friendly stuff.

926
00:55:14,523 --> 00:55:17,024
Speaker 1: Yeah It exists.

927
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know a lot of.

928
00:55:18,231 --> 00:55:20,000
Speaker 1: even Ben and Jerry's I'm pretty sure is real chocolate.

929
00:55:20,081 --> 00:55:21,720
Speaker 1: Maybe it's on the border might depend.

930
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,700
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a lot of things that are chocolate, but there's just some nonsense in them and they're not really chocolate.

931
00:55:26,261 --> 00:55:33,660
Speaker 0: Mmm, I think my favorite form of chocolate in the world is actually probably just simple chocolate bar.

932
00:55:33,720 --> 00:55:40,438
Speaker 0: I actually don't like the Fancy candies that are chocolate with mystery crap inside a mystery crap inside.

933
00:55:40,458 --> 00:55:41,000
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

934
00:55:41,221 --> 00:55:44,360
Speaker 0: Well, like you get the fancy box of chocolates and there's a hundred unique ones.

935
00:55:44,560 --> 00:55:50,619
Speaker 0: Oh those yes, like a dive a type style half of them have just like a really overwrought cream.

936
00:55:51,342 --> 00:55:54,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah a really badly done raspberry.

937
00:55:55,642 --> 00:56:07,840
Speaker 1: So Godiva right is like the slightly overpriced for what it is, but still better than Hershey's But not actually as good as real fancy chocolate, you know chain store Like I need to buy chocolate for someone for a holiday or a gift.

938
00:56:07,921 --> 00:56:10,479
Speaker 1: I go to there and I buy a gold box full of chocolates, right?

939
00:56:10,881 --> 00:56:17,140
Speaker 1: But if you go most of the stuff in the in the Godiva box of stuff is is just like what you said, right?

940
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:17,863
Speaker 1: It's not any good.

941
00:56:17,903 --> 00:56:21,980
Speaker 1: It's like oh, there's a cherry in there with a bunch of cream and you don't really taste the chocolate.

942
00:56:22,740 --> 00:56:24,119
Speaker 1: But they have some.

943
00:56:25,121 --> 00:56:29,560
Speaker 1: If you buy a box, they have like a little disc and the dicks is full of mint and that's a good one, right?

944
00:56:30,302 --> 00:56:43,072
Speaker 1: And if you go up to the counter at that place I used to do this way back in the day I haven't done this and like maybe since I was in high school for like a dollar each They had these ones that I forget what they're called But it's basically a fancy chocolate and it's like coin of cha.

945
00:56:43,092 --> 00:56:51,000
Speaker 1: I could I could point to it if I was in the Godiva store But it was like really actually really good and I would just get those only and I wouldn't get the variety.

946
00:56:51,060 --> 00:56:52,370
Speaker 1: I'd be like give me three of those.

947
00:56:52,692 --> 00:56:53,498
Speaker 1: Those are the good ones.

948
00:56:54,202 --> 00:56:58,040
Speaker 0: So I realized my chocolate chocolate taste changed as I grew up and learn more about chocolate.

949
00:56:58,141 --> 00:57:00,900
Speaker 0: But also, you know, I was just like in a middle-class family.

950
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:03,450
Speaker 0: So we bought the cheap stuff in the grocery store usually.

951
00:57:03,471 --> 00:57:10,836
Speaker 0: but when I was a kid a young kid Andy's mint the little chocolate Andy's mint Second ago.

952
00:57:11,121 --> 00:57:18,800
Speaker 0: But I was so obsessed with those as a kid and like they were the special treat Like if I was able to get him it was kind of a rare thing.

953
00:57:18,881 --> 00:57:21,160
Speaker 1: They come in a whole box like a million of them in there, right?

954
00:57:21,220 --> 00:57:25,400
Speaker 1: So compared to the buying like a Hershey bar, which you eat all at once you get a box of Andy's candy.

955
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:32,020
Speaker 0: He's like, holy shit Yeah, and I'd like rad like eat him one by one like day by day and an RIT for a while.

956
00:57:32,141 --> 00:57:41,300
Speaker 0: We would like get him like have a box of them in the apartment but If you don't eat him for a while, and you've had better chocolates and you go back and eat an Andy's.

957
00:57:42,262 --> 00:57:45,890
Speaker 0: They're pretty shitty Like they're not great.

958
00:57:46,232 --> 00:57:47,680
Speaker 0: When was the last time you ate an Andy's mint?

959
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:50,560
Speaker 1: I haven't because I've been buying the Ritter Sport Pfeffer.

960
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:57,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, go eat an Andy's mint and you're gonna get a neck away for feeling really that kind of feeling I felt I feel it.

961
00:57:57,485 --> 00:58:00,600
Speaker 0: I feel like the chocolate is pasty and the mint is weak.

962
00:58:00,700 --> 00:58:04,218
Speaker 1: So, I mean it's never been great, but it's still like, you know, it's still like.

963
00:58:04,258 --> 00:58:06,780
Speaker 1: I was just saying It's like it might as well be Hershey's chocolate with me.

964
00:58:07,061 --> 00:58:13,240
Speaker 0: It just feels thin like I'd rather I'd rather eat a Hershey's bar than a box of Andy's mints these days.

965
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:16,999
Speaker 0: Mmm interesting cuz I had an Andy's mint like a couple years ago.

966
00:58:17,461 --> 00:58:19,829
Speaker 0: It just like randomly and I remember thinking like whoa.

967
00:58:19,869 --> 00:58:20,130
Speaker 0: Whoa.

968
00:58:20,190 --> 00:58:20,772
Speaker 0: This is not.

969
00:58:21,415 --> 00:58:24,845
Speaker 0: either my taste buds changed or Andy's mints got worse.

970
00:58:25,347 --> 00:58:28,659
Speaker 0: Something's wrong here and I ate another one and there's not that good anymore.

971
00:58:31,145 --> 00:58:32,674
Speaker 0: End of an era not eating the Andy's.

972
00:58:33,277 --> 00:58:35,867
Speaker 0: Oh well So we made this.

973
00:58:35,887 --> 00:58:38,299
Speaker 0: we stretch the show into an hour, I guess we could just stop there.

974
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:47,059
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know I'm sure there's like a million things to talk about chocolate related because it's such a. you could probably do a Chocolate podcast if you were a chocolate expert, you know.

975
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:51,480
Speaker 1: But I just don't know too much about it other than I like it in almost all its forms.

976
00:58:52,003 --> 00:58:54,600
Speaker 1: It is delicious and essential to life though.

977
00:58:54,620 --> 00:58:59,580
Speaker 0: I learned something actually recently and I see a link to a reference to it in the Wikipedia.

978
00:59:00,322 --> 00:59:02,630
Speaker 0: So, uh, so we talked about marijuana being legal.

979
00:59:02,711 --> 00:59:12,801
Speaker 0: so I occasionally where it is legal consumer chocolate chocolate chocolate weed most of the marijuana I have consumed in places where it's legal is chocolate because that's like The.

980
00:59:13,162 --> 00:59:22,251
Speaker 0: it's one of the best things to put that flavor in because we does a very distinctive flavor and that flavor is It the shall we say an acquired taste.

981
00:59:22,592 --> 00:59:24,318
Speaker 1: Is it anything like it smells?

982
00:59:24,399 --> 00:59:26,564
Speaker 0: Yeah Exactly like it smells.

983
00:59:26,845 --> 00:59:28,308
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that's why.

984
00:59:28,649 --> 00:59:36,800
Speaker 0: so that flavor when most people make a an edible marijuana thing Does not mesh well with the food.

985
00:59:37,221 --> 00:59:41,195
Speaker 0: So it's like you eat a chocolate or you eat a chocolate that a skunk farted on.

986
00:59:41,657 --> 00:59:42,480
Speaker 0: now those are your options.

987
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:48,080
Speaker 0: But in in Seattle the fancy chocolatiers are making fancy chocolates.

988
00:59:48,140 --> 00:59:53,599
Speaker 0: Let's try to mix the flavor with like certain kinds of dark chocolates where they'll complement each other and they're pretty good.

989
00:59:54,563 --> 00:59:59,480
Speaker 0: They're not great, but they're pretty good like they taste good or at least interesting on their own.

990
01:00:00,083 --> 01:00:11,280
Speaker 0: But I learned through some completely unrelated research tangential to that That some of the chemicals in chocolate are the same cannabinoids that give marijuana its effects.

991
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:18,560
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm now not the THC not the like super high effect, but the cannabinoids the the oils the other pieces.

992
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:22,675
Speaker 0: There's little effects that eating a lot of chocolate has.

993
01:00:22,956 --> 01:00:31,180
Speaker 0: that could be similar to Some of the sub effects that marijuana has on people but not the super high effects that you typically associate with marijuana.

994
01:00:31,602 --> 01:00:37,378
Speaker 0: It is true chocolate will mess you up but not in not in a like whoa dude way But in a really subtle way.

995
01:00:38,144 --> 01:00:40,799
Speaker 0: And there's a lot of stuff about that that I do not know.

996
01:00:41,401 --> 01:00:48,220
Speaker 0: I've already delved into the extent of what I know about that and this Wikipedia article basically just confirmed that that is a thing.

997
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:52,772
Speaker 0: it isn't just nothing and the article about it appears to be an Italian.

998
01:00:52,792 --> 01:00:56,909
Speaker 0: so I Can't go any further in this podcast.

999
01:00:57,150 --> 01:00:58,316
Speaker 0: and now we've gone over in hours.

1000
01:00:58,357 --> 01:01:00,681
Speaker 0: I think we're done Chocolate eat it.

1001
