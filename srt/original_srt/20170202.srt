Speaker 0: what is good?

6
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:33,840
Speaker 1: Absolutely nothing except defeating Nazis and possibly beating the Empire and movies.

7
00:00:34,885 --> 00:00:39,333
Speaker 1: Let's do this So not to get too deep into the politics of all that.

8
00:00:39,594 --> 00:00:40,076
Speaker 0: he's going deep.

9
00:00:40,277 --> 00:00:41,449
Speaker 1: I'm going deep I know.

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,963
Speaker 1: so right now You know the.

11
00:00:43,003 --> 00:00:46,293
Speaker 1: the probably the biggest threat to American democracy is that Bannon guy.

12
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:56,147
Speaker 1: you know the Nazi like the actual Nazi white Supremacist who was on the National Security Council, so I know I called the Senate office to be like yo as a constituent.

13
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:57,918
Speaker 1: do not put him on that body.

14
00:00:57,939 --> 00:01:06,162
Speaker 1: and I was standing in City Hall Park like I try to make these calls before I got on the subway to go home And I call like five times busy signal busy signal busy You know.

15
00:01:06,323 --> 00:01:08,880
Speaker 1: then I get a ring and it goes to their voicemail.

16
00:01:08,981 --> 00:01:12,700
Speaker 1: So I leave a voicemail, and I think and then it became full and then I'm by myself.

17
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:14,574
Speaker 1: So I think I like you know I make the phone call.

18
00:01:14,614 --> 00:01:15,360
Speaker 1: I'm just like out in the park.

19
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:25,079
Speaker 1: There's no one really around me, and I hang up and just as I'm walking away There's this dude who was sitting like a ways away But I guess he overheard me and he just looks at me and says fuck Nazis.

20
00:01:25,941 --> 00:01:27,948
Speaker 1: And I'm like yeah, and then he's like.

21
00:01:28,289 --> 00:01:31,199
Speaker 1: I called this morning, and then I got in the subway, okay?

22
00:01:31,722 --> 00:01:36,524
Speaker 1: I would have told the story about the weird guy on the subway, but it's not weird enough Wasn't like I'd see?

23
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:37,809
Speaker 1: no just you know.

24
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,407
Speaker 1: you know sometimes you run into someone who's like something weird going on But you're not quite sure what.

25
00:01:42,648 --> 00:01:44,679
Speaker 0: and sometimes they drugs and or mental illness.

26
00:01:44,699 --> 00:01:53,620
Speaker 1: yeah But you know you know the the New York sense like you see someone on the subway And you don't know what their deal is, but you know there is a deal, so you know drugs or mental illness.

27
00:01:53,721 --> 00:01:55,699
Speaker 0: There's no reason to like pay attention to them.

28
00:01:55,880 --> 00:01:58,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, well other than you don't turn your back fully on them.

29
00:01:58,818 --> 00:02:08,119
Speaker 1: well Keep them in the peripheral vision and if they escalate one more step you hold your phone You don't do anything with it, but you're ready to start recording.

30
00:02:10,466 --> 00:02:13,588
Speaker 1: So he was like Almost at the line of.

31
00:02:13,628 --> 00:02:15,559
Speaker 1: this will be an interesting story, and then nothing happened.

32
00:02:16,523 --> 00:02:20,500
Speaker 0: Okay, so new is this is one of those days where I can get away with free news.

33
00:02:21,221 --> 00:02:27,525
Speaker 0: I probably have done this many times, but this Sunday is oh yeah the superb owl Lee Li.

34
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:31,038
Speaker 1: they went back to Roman numerals correctly, but you said they wouldn't.

35
00:02:31,058 --> 00:02:31,480
Speaker 0: you were wrong.

36
00:02:31,721 --> 00:02:32,525
Speaker 1: I didn't think they would.

37
00:02:32,565 --> 00:02:33,489
Speaker 1: I'm actually really happy.

38
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:34,735
Speaker 1: they went back whoo-hoo.

39
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:35,800
Speaker 0: It's superb owl?

40
00:02:36,843 --> 00:02:37,807
Speaker 0: I don't know.

41
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,493
Speaker 1: I won't watch it cuz I'm just I'm.

42
00:02:39,814 --> 00:02:41,399
Speaker 1: the CTE stuff has bothered me enough.

43
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:45,800
Speaker 0: to where I'm trying to not watch football anymore, but you're watching hockey which is the same problem.

44
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:49,800
Speaker 1: I think hockey has a significantly less degree, and I've seen substantial changes.

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:03:03,170
Speaker 1: So actually I was talking about this today on Twitter cuz someone reminded me how much I hate the rules of soccer But the I. the problem was that there is now real evidence that headers in soccer Do cause CTE and on concussion like symptoms.

46
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:09,416
Speaker 1: sure yeah, you hitting your head against anything is bad Yeah, but it's particularly like you can hit your head occasionally like everyone hits their head.

47
00:03:09,496 --> 00:03:10,099
Speaker 1: You can't hit it.

48
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,912
Speaker 0: I was dropped out of the sidewalk.

49
00:03:12,033 --> 00:03:19,407
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I was baby I got knocked the fuck out in a ski accident once a long time ago But they were like.

50
00:03:19,447 --> 00:03:20,673
Speaker 1: headers are specifically bad.

51
00:03:20,693 --> 00:03:24,099
Speaker 1: so Jane McGonigal was like It's just a game.

52
00:03:24,823 --> 00:03:27,036
Speaker 1: We can change the rules to games.

53
00:03:27,518 --> 00:03:27,699
Speaker 0: yep.

54
00:03:28,701 --> 00:03:29,605
Speaker 0: So why don't we?

55
00:03:29,805 --> 00:03:33,037
Speaker 0: because people care about tradition more than they care about what's fair?

56
00:03:33,077 --> 00:03:33,499
Speaker 0: What's right?

57
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:33,780
Speaker 1: Yep?

58
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,800
Speaker 1: So I got into a discussion with some game design.

59
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,894
Speaker 1: We're just sort of talking about like.

60
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:39,609
Speaker 1: well What how would you change that rule?

61
00:03:39,851 --> 00:03:41,120
Speaker 1: and is there a clever way?

62
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:45,939
Speaker 1: To avoid the dangers of that without making like a really restrictive rule on the game?

63
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:47,505
Speaker 0: Don't hit you can't hit the ball with your head.

64
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:48,368
Speaker 0: very done.

65
00:03:48,388 --> 00:03:49,793
Speaker 0: so problem solved.

66
00:03:50,054 --> 00:03:51,840
Speaker 0: so it's the same as a handball.

67
00:03:52,281 --> 00:04:00,409
Speaker 1: Hockey has a really interesting example there in the icing rule change because that was what like Hockey is the most willing to change the rules.

68
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:05,113
Speaker 0: yeah, and hockey has done things over time like hey go They got to wear a mask.

69
00:04:05,174 --> 00:04:08,792
Speaker 0: hey great Everyone's got to wear a helmet now, and they don't grandfather everyone in.

70
00:04:08,832 --> 00:04:09,696
Speaker 0: they say deal with it.

71
00:04:09,876 --> 00:04:10,860
Speaker 0: There's other sports.

72
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,365
Speaker 0: They're like baseball.

73
00:04:12,405 --> 00:04:22,365
Speaker 0: do this and the baseball players union the strongest sports union on the earth is like nope It's like stop stabbing yourself in the arm every time you Come up Gavin at bad.

74
00:04:22,385 --> 00:04:24,070
Speaker 1: They're like, but it's tradition.

75
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:25,856
Speaker 1: They're like, but you guys all have gangrene.

76
00:04:25,876 --> 00:04:27,240
Speaker 1: It's like no, but tradition man.

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,486
Speaker 1: So but hockey.

78
00:04:29,527 --> 00:04:30,632
Speaker 1: they'd like the changes.

79
00:04:30,793 --> 00:04:31,878
Speaker 1: I thought was most interesting.

80
00:04:32,461 --> 00:04:38,287
Speaker 1: Relevant to that was the icing rule a few years ago because in the old days You know icing for those of you who don't know is

81
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,035
Speaker 0: if you hit the puck and it goes

82
00:04:41,076 --> 00:04:42,039
Speaker 1: over too many

83
00:04:42,099 --> 00:04:54,648
Speaker 0: lines Wards the zone where you are going to be on offense It crosses over two red lines meaning the one in the middle of the ice and the one that's you know lined up with the goal.

84
00:04:54,668 --> 00:05:02,297
Speaker 0: if it crosses both those lines and You don't go and get it before the other team gets it then it's icing.

85
00:05:02,437 --> 00:05:02,698
Speaker 1: yep.

86
00:05:02,939 --> 00:05:07,325
Speaker 1: now If you shoot it over there, and you already got a guy over there That's offsides you know.

87
00:05:07,486 --> 00:05:09,995
Speaker 0: if your guys waiting about the blue line, and then runs.

88
00:05:10,015 --> 00:05:15,880
Speaker 1: It's okay gets it But but he can't be over that blue line He's got to come back right.

89
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:18,970
Speaker 0: But anyway the problem is to go over the blue line before the guy.

90
00:05:19,011 --> 00:05:29,678
Speaker 1: now icing was a rule that was intended to prevent really Boring hockey of people to shoot it all the way the fuck across constantly, but you're the rule goes away During a power play because otherwise you'd be fun.

91
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:40,477
Speaker 1: So the problem with the icing rules until a few years ago Was that the offense and the defense had an incentive to race for the puck.

92
00:05:40,718 --> 00:05:49,499
Speaker 1: so you have two Huge dudes sometimes three skating as fast as they can Toward a wall and each other people still do that.

93
00:05:50,122 --> 00:05:57,666
Speaker 1: So the problem was when they got to that wall the puck and two or three huge dudes are there And they would crash into each other.

94
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:06,451
Speaker 1: and the NHL recognized pretty rapidly that this was causing an Inordinate number of serious head injuries and other kinds of injuries.

95
00:06:06,752 --> 00:06:11,496
Speaker 1: like that action alone accounted for a huge percentage of the total injuries in the hockey right.

96
00:06:11,516 --> 00:06:17,880
Speaker 0: so now they have Automatic icing which is like if you're if the puck is like way far away from everybody, and it's just icing.

97
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:19,117
Speaker 0: It's just icing they don't let you.

98
00:06:19,842 --> 00:06:22,691
Speaker 0: Only let you chase it down if you're like already kind of close to better.

99
00:06:22,892 --> 00:06:34,185
Speaker 1: even if there is a chase if the linesman Not even the ref if the linesman as far as I know Decides that the defense guy is definitely gonna beat that like win the race They'll just blow it dead.

100
00:06:34,285 --> 00:06:40,900
Speaker 1: so you don't have the crash at the end right, but if the offense guy has a chance You still get the dramatic chase.

101
00:06:41,362 --> 00:06:44,414
Speaker 0: But the defense guy winning is the same as just automatic out right.

102
00:06:44,434 --> 00:06:44,896
Speaker 0: so it doesn't.

103
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:49,693
Speaker 1: there's no reason to chase But they only let the risky thing that causes injuries happen.

104
00:06:50,074 --> 00:06:53,149
Speaker 1: if there's a like a legit shot It was gonna make it pretty rare.

105
00:06:53,330 --> 00:07:03,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, so think instead of just like Drastically changing the rules of hockey they made this subtle change that kept the drama while substantially reducing the number of head injuries in hockey.

106
00:07:04,302 --> 00:07:07,580
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm problem is soccer's rules are so simple except for their stupid offsides.

107
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, you thought the icing rule.

108
00:07:10,105 --> 00:07:11,590
Speaker 0: I just talked about was complicated.

109
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:12,071
Speaker 0: What easy.

110
00:07:12,091 --> 00:07:13,234
Speaker 0: the soccer offsides rule.

111
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:25,788
Speaker 1: yep, but anyway yeah I really have increasing issues with football because I feel like football is the most damaging and least morally Defensible sport in America right now.

112
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,636
Speaker 0: sure I mean we used to have boxing though.

113
00:07:27,817 --> 00:07:30,384
Speaker 0: Yeah, but boxing Is still a thing.

114
00:07:30,685 --> 00:07:32,371
Speaker 1: yeah, MMA is complicated though.

115
00:07:32,632 --> 00:07:33,997
Speaker 1: I get the impression.

116
00:07:34,017 --> 00:07:37,239
Speaker 1: There's no boxing Yeah, but at the same time the fights are over quicker.

117
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:39,916
Speaker 0: And sure I saw a fight the other day.

118
00:07:39,936 --> 00:07:42,454
Speaker 0: this guy Smacked this guy real hard.

119
00:07:42,514 --> 00:07:47,848
Speaker 0: he went down And then he went over to jump and stomp him on the face And then he got.

120
00:07:47,908 --> 00:07:51,805
Speaker 0: basically he got immediately disqualified because yeah But that the reason he got the.

121
00:07:52,126 --> 00:07:54,776
Speaker 0: why did he stomp a guy's face though and getting me this qualified?

122
00:07:54,796 --> 00:08:01,880
Speaker 0: because in the previous Version of MMA that he was in like the other league or whatever you were allowed to stop on people's faces.

123
00:08:02,362 --> 00:08:05,195
Speaker 0: He was used to it, and then as soon as he got disqualified.

124
00:08:05,215 --> 00:08:14,887
Speaker 0: He was like no Oops Oops Cuz he basically had won already.

125
00:08:15,087 --> 00:08:18,240
Speaker 0: yeah, if you just hadn't tried to stop the face after winning you would have been fine.

126
00:08:18,402 --> 00:08:18,871
Speaker 0: I just won.

127
00:08:18,892 --> 00:08:19,218
Speaker 0: yeah.

128
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,025
Speaker 1: But also think about the difference of boxing.

129
00:08:21,085 --> 00:08:27,784
Speaker 1: had the sort of subtle problem of the constant lower impact hits to the head would cause All right.

130
00:08:27,965 --> 00:08:33,340
Speaker 0: one punch to the head in boxing is is way worse than one hit in football.

131
00:08:33,844 --> 00:08:38,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, but how many you take Boxing over 20 years.

132
00:08:38,486 --> 00:08:40,873
Speaker 0: It depends on your style of boxing right?

133
00:08:40,893 --> 00:08:44,820
Speaker 0: yeah, Muhammad Ali in his early days He didn't take so many hits.

134
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,767
Speaker 0: It's only you know after he came back after dodging the draft and not being able to box for some years and then getting old And deciding to keep boxing.

135
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,640
Speaker 0: Oh, that's when he started robed open and taking all the hits.

136
00:08:55,861 --> 00:09:02,404
Speaker 0: So if you're just a badass and knocks people to fuck out like Mike Tyson say or you know early in his career It'd be over in two seconds.

137
00:09:02,424 --> 00:09:06,256
Speaker 0: Oh, you're not taking too many hits, but basically boxing.

138
00:09:06,276 --> 00:09:08,682
Speaker 1: I'm kind of glad it's dying MMA.

139
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,046
Speaker 1: I will see how safe it gets.

140
00:09:10,528 --> 00:09:13,437
Speaker 1: I feel like football just has the least moral high ground to stand on.

141
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:16,814
Speaker 0: but football on The other hand is the most game like of game.

142
00:09:17,116 --> 00:09:20,211
Speaker 0: Yeah, right It's like regardless of the people hurting each other.

143
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,160
Speaker 1: He's pretty close in a lot of ways.

144
00:09:22,903 --> 00:09:26,340
Speaker 0: High football is basically a board game with real people as pawns.

145
00:09:26,481 --> 00:09:28,428
Speaker 0: That's it's like what every nerd wants to play.

146
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:29,391
Speaker 0: That's why we have blood Bowl.

147
00:09:29,411 --> 00:09:35,254
Speaker 1: I would be into football with semi-intelligent robots or animatronics actually doing the playing.

148
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:44,632
Speaker 0: I'd be into football with Actually blood Bowl with orcs and elves dwarves Actually killing each other.

149
00:09:46,421 --> 00:09:48,549
Speaker 1: Maybe we can get that with some VR AR action.

150
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:49,413
Speaker 0: I'm sure.

151
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:51,200
Speaker 0: but I mean blood Bowl video game where it exists.

152
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,134
Speaker 0: I'm sure it will just in every other form.

153
00:09:53,557 --> 00:10:02,391
Speaker 1: of course I can't watch Super Bowl anyway because I'm gonna be on a ski trip And I don't really feel like putting forth the effort to see it even though I assume it'll be on in every sports bar in New Hampshire.

154
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:05,713
Speaker 0: It'll probably be on every television And everywhere.

155
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:10,623
Speaker 1: yep I pretty much always take a ski trip these years during the Super Bowl So I never see it.

156
00:10:10,824 --> 00:10:12,933
Speaker 0: not a lot of people skiing at that time.

157
00:10:13,194 --> 00:10:16,663
Speaker 0: well happens to be a cold time Right around.

158
00:10:16,723 --> 00:10:19,574
Speaker 1: now is like the best time to do a ski trip.

159
00:10:19,614 --> 00:10:22,085
Speaker 1: if you do it midweek is in the middle of the week No one skis.

160
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:24,380
Speaker 1: yeah of course not except like rich people who live there.

161
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,340
Speaker 0: And this is crazy good weather and people are crazy enough to take the day off because it's so good.

162
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:28,782
Speaker 0: It's not like if

163
00:10:28,803 --> 00:10:40,756
Speaker 1: you're out west like I was talking to people in Utah when I was there like yeah People just all call in sick if there's a good snow day on like Tuesday And that's like it's acceptable like the boss would be like why'd you come into work?

164
00:10:41,218 --> 00:10:41,920
Speaker 1: There's snow.

165
00:10:42,161 --> 00:10:42,925
Speaker 0: I don't ski.

166
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:44,031
Speaker 0: why do I live here?

167
00:10:44,051 --> 00:10:45,237
Speaker 0: Why do you live in Utah?

168
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:45,820
Speaker 1: You don't ski?

169
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,894
Speaker 1: There's literally no other reason to live in Utah.

170
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:48,499
Speaker 0: That's correct.

171
00:10:50,924 --> 00:10:52,240
Speaker 1: So who do you think is gonna win the Super Bowl?

172
00:10:52,940 --> 00:11:00,200
Speaker 0: I think the New England Patriots will win because they play to win unlike other teams that don't play to win.

173
00:11:01,482 --> 00:11:02,907
Speaker 1: That is what I could say about the Patriots.

174
00:11:03,068 --> 00:11:07,204
Speaker 0: other people right they always be saying like hey Patriots cheating And you know what I say.

175
00:11:07,224 --> 00:11:09,575
Speaker 0: I say this look Lance Armstrong.

176
00:11:09,615 --> 00:11:10,017
Speaker 0: He cheated.

177
00:11:10,037 --> 00:11:11,929
Speaker 0: yeah He cheated big-time, and you know.

178
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:13,560
Speaker 0: you know what they did when they caught him cheating.

179
00:11:14,045 --> 00:11:15,539
Speaker 0: They said guess what you didn't win anymore.

180
00:11:15,579 --> 00:11:16,222
Speaker 0: now You lose.

181
00:11:16,482 --> 00:11:22,179
Speaker 0: you lose that you've won zero Tour de France's Lance Armstrong zero because you cheated, and he did right.

182
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:24,357
Speaker 0: no But Patriots they cheated.

183
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:26,549
Speaker 0: So they broke the rules.

184
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,634
Speaker 0: and what did they say?

185
00:11:27,714 --> 00:11:28,840
Speaker 0: they said oh you broke that rule?

186
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:33,237
Speaker 0: We will fine you and suspend you for four games, and you know here are the penalties.

187
00:11:33,257 --> 00:11:34,805
Speaker 0: and they said oh But we still won.

188
00:11:35,289 --> 00:11:36,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, you still won.

189
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:44,050
Speaker 0: well If I'm playing a board game if I'm playing settlers, and you tell me I'll give you two victory points for ten dollars.

190
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:46,360
Speaker 0: I mean I didn't earn the two victory points.

191
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,908
Speaker 0: I just give you ten dollars, and I win.

192
00:11:47,928 --> 00:11:50,365
Speaker 0: I'm doing that every fucking time I think.

193
00:11:50,386 --> 00:11:54,033
Speaker 0: the other teams Why aren't you doing everything that you're allowed to?

194
00:11:54,133 --> 00:11:55,358
Speaker 0: if the penalty up to?

195
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,713
Speaker 0: Write any penalty that only includes money or whatever.

196
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,220
Speaker 0: that doesn't make you lose.

197
00:12:01,062 --> 00:12:06,480
Speaker 0: You should be doing all those things if you believe they will really give you an advantage to winning because winning is priority one.

198
00:12:06,901 --> 00:12:13,500
Speaker 0: Yep, I'm very glad that you know the hoodie plays football a game in which I don't know how to compete with him.

199
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:24,010
Speaker 0: Imagine if like that player of games played like Magic the Gathering or chess or Netrunner or Overwatch or anything else.

200
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:27,520
Speaker 0: right he would be like winning everything every day all the time.

201
00:12:28,142 --> 00:12:31,191
Speaker 0: It's good that he plays football a game only like 30-something.

202
00:12:31,211 --> 00:12:34,020
Speaker 0: people have to compete with him and none of them can win.

203
00:12:34,904 --> 00:12:38,059
Speaker 1: So in other news minor giants minor politics news.

204
00:12:38,501 --> 00:12:53,817
Speaker 0: Interesting fact despite the Patriots winning so many Super Bowls and appearing in the Super Bowl so even many more times than that over the past 16 or so years In the past 10 years the only team with two Super Bowl wins is the New York Football Giants.

205
00:12:54,098 --> 00:12:57,764
Speaker 0: Wow really yeah Cuz the Patriots won Once recently.

206
00:12:57,784 --> 00:13:05,604
Speaker 0: they appeared multiple times in the past 10 years true, but they kept losing to the giant And they would this the other.

207
00:13:05,665 --> 00:13:09,317
Speaker 0: the time they won before their recent win was you know 11 years ago.

208
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:14,539
Speaker 0: So if you only take the most recent 10 years they only won one.

209
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:18,840
Speaker 1: Because I don't have much of a horse in this race I mean the only the only bowl I care about is not a bowl.

210
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,523
Speaker 0: I got no horse.

211
00:13:19,684 --> 00:13:21,855
Speaker 0: I both I mean even at the pages lose.

212
00:13:21,895 --> 00:13:22,096
Speaker 0: It's like.

213
00:13:22,137 --> 00:13:22,780
Speaker 0: I don't care.

214
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:25,489
Speaker 0: I mean I want them to win for reasons, but I don't.

215
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:25,911
Speaker 0: it's like.

216
00:13:25,931 --> 00:13:27,777
Speaker 0: there's no evil teams left therefore.

217
00:13:28,198 --> 00:13:28,660
Speaker 1: It's all good.

218
00:13:28,881 --> 00:13:32,093
Speaker 1: I don't care about a bowl so much as a cup and we're getting not.

219
00:13:32,113 --> 00:13:34,080
Speaker 1: we're not too far away from the cup stuff.

220
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:37,269
Speaker 0: You got like to May and June.

221
00:13:37,289 --> 00:13:39,760
Speaker 1: yeah, yeah, we're over the halfway point.

222
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure I'm worried about the Red Wings prospects of making the end of the playoffs.

223
00:13:44,521 --> 00:13:47,459
Speaker 1: I don't want that streak to end, but it's uh it's gonna be a dicey affair.

224
00:13:48,984 --> 00:13:49,796
Speaker 1: We'll see what happens.

225
00:13:51,001 --> 00:13:57,950
Speaker 1: So in some minor well not minor news, but some interesting news you might see on Twitter There's a lot of people tweeting about a general strike.

226
00:13:58,412 --> 00:14:00,399
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it's not time for that yet.

227
00:14:00,459 --> 00:14:09,020
Speaker 1: like The only thing worse than like not trying a general strike when shit gets bad politically is trying and failing at a general strike.

228
00:14:09,261 --> 00:14:12,560
Speaker 1: I think he says hey guess what we're powerless.

229
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:16,420
Speaker 0: I mean the thing is I think you got a because it's such a scary deal.

230
00:14:16,762 --> 00:14:21,062
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to ease into it right you get back all right everybody Everyone.

231
00:14:21,203 --> 00:14:23,455

00:14:23,475 --> 00:14:26,691
Speaker 0: yeah, right And you just sort of test the like you got to put the toe in.

233
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:28,540
Speaker 0: you can't you can't cannonball into the pool on that.

234
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:31,900
Speaker 1: That is my news because that is what's happening right now.

235
00:14:32,341 --> 00:14:35,780
Speaker 1: That easing in because you might not have noticed because it didn't only happen for a little while.

236
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,560
Speaker 0: But it's not happening where those people live.

237
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:47,653
Speaker 1: But during the protest around the executive order and the travel ban and all that stuff you know when you know Pretty much every international airport in America had a mob of lawyers and smart people protesting.

238
00:14:48,515 --> 00:14:54,239
Speaker 1: the New York City taxis Temporarily went on a full strike against going to the airport.

239
00:14:54,601 --> 00:14:58,099
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm that ain't that is not easy to make happen.

240
00:14:59,043 --> 00:15:03,539
Speaker 1: The fact and they didn't it wasn't forever like they resumed doing the airport stuff like the next day.

241
00:15:04,181 --> 00:15:11,524
Speaker 1: They weren't saying like this strike is the moment they were saying we are capable of striking take note Mm-hmm.

242
00:15:11,928 --> 00:15:18,312
Speaker 1: and then today strike to the Comcast workers thousands and thousands of Comcast workers.

243
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:22,085
Speaker 1: Comcast let him go yeah But that plus one for Comcast.

244
00:15:22,105 --> 00:15:25,796
Speaker 1: basically Comcast workers walked out of the job to do a big protest.

245
00:15:26,278 --> 00:15:29,908
Speaker 1: and today All the Yemeni owned bodegas.

246
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:30,912
Speaker 0: I didn't know there's so many.

247
00:15:30,992 --> 00:15:40,705
Speaker 0: I mean bodegas are owned by pretty much Yeah, you've never seen a bodega owned by someone who wasn't an immigrant right, but they're owned by such a wide variety Yeah of immigrants like.

248
00:15:40,725 --> 00:15:44,520
Speaker 0: there's not a country you could think of where that someone from that country owns a bite.

249
00:15:44,781 --> 00:15:46,489
Speaker 0: It's like I seen the Jew bodega.

250
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:48,640
Speaker 0: I seem like any country on earth.

251
00:15:49,444 --> 00:15:51,113
Speaker 0: There's a sushi place near me.

252
00:15:51,133 --> 00:15:54,397
Speaker 0: That's like What's the fucking country?

253
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,544
Speaker 1: All right, I'm really curious.

254
00:15:57,645 --> 00:15:57,825
Speaker 0: No.

255
00:15:57,886 --> 00:15:58,729
Speaker 0: It's it's over.

256
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,331
Speaker 1: You forgot.

257
00:15:59,452 --> 00:16:04,980
Speaker 0: It's the really tiny country near Vietnam Cambodia.

258
00:16:07,641 --> 00:16:15,119
Speaker 0: It starts with a B. I think I forget but whatever it's like the craziest tiny countries that you never think about ever.

259
00:16:15,962 --> 00:16:21,413
Speaker 1: Uh Right, all right Burma, yes, Bangladesh.

260
00:16:21,433 --> 00:16:23,580
Speaker 0: There's a Burmese sushi place in a story.

261
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,866
Speaker 1: Majority bodegas are Yemeni owned.

262
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:33,400
Speaker 0: I didn't realize so many bodegas were owned by Yemenis because I checked the bodega near me.

263
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:34,123
Speaker 0: It was totally open.

264
00:16:34,163 --> 00:16:35,126
Speaker 0: I guess it's not Yemeni.

265
00:16:35,247 --> 00:16:35,488
Speaker 0: Yep.

266
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:38,900
Speaker 1: Now there were a lot of non-yemenian bodegas who closed in solidarity.

267
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:40,895
Speaker 0: Sure I mean if I had a bodega I closed that shit.

268
00:16:41,137 --> 00:16:45,680
Speaker 1: but Lot of bodegas shut down and no one outside of New York.

269
00:16:45,721 --> 00:16:48,627
Speaker 0: I didn't actually see a shut down one Which I kind of wanted to see.

270
00:16:48,687 --> 00:16:51,801
Speaker 1: the one in my building at work was shut down cuz then I'd know which one to go To.

271
00:16:52,043 --> 00:16:55,260
Speaker 0: yeah, I guess the one near me that I go to the most didn't shut down.

272
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,326
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if I should.

273
00:16:56,367 --> 00:16:58,440
Speaker 1: I go there one by my office that was shut down.

274
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:02,760
Speaker 1: All they had in the door was a hashtag resist and a big American flag.

275
00:17:04,161 --> 00:17:06,449
Speaker 1: So no one outside of New York City knows that happened.

276
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,232
Speaker 0: That's our.

277
00:17:07,252 --> 00:17:12,470
Speaker 0: New York City knows that bodega is yeah But they go stop and shout that shit ain't closing that.

278
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:20,099
Speaker 1: my news is just to remember very clearly because I know you know The labor movement was good at this sort of thing and the labor movement has been all but destroyed in the United States.

279
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,951
Speaker 1: Like they lost a lot of their power, but they know how to organize.

280
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:24,195
Speaker 0: Well, they shouldn't have been corrupt.

281
00:17:24,718 --> 00:17:27,551
Speaker 0: Yeah They lost their power by being corrupt.

282
00:17:27,571 --> 00:17:29,020
Speaker 0: So they took the power away from them, right?

283
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:29,662
Speaker 0: It's like they had.

284
00:17:29,682 --> 00:17:32,111
Speaker 0: they were a good thing and then they use their power for evil.

285
00:17:32,131 --> 00:17:33,496
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do?

286
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:39,454
Speaker 1: But anyway Those people I'll take the low relatively low level of corruption we've had.

287
00:17:39,494 --> 00:17:43,749
Speaker 0: yes cuz the Union leaders You know taking embezzling all that money.

288
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,472
Speaker 0: I was low-level.

289
00:17:45,075 --> 00:17:46,400
Speaker 1: I'd say that's relatively low-level.

290
00:17:46,521 --> 00:17:48,700
Speaker 1: I've been to places where there is high-level corruption.

291
00:17:49,382 --> 00:17:53,760
Speaker 0: So you go and you just find out your 401k there is missing some money, you know, where'd it go?

292
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:57,374
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I mean there's places where like the banks like who are you again?

293
00:17:57,394 --> 00:17:58,519
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, huh?

294
00:17:59,441 --> 00:18:00,687
Speaker 1: That's an interesting savings account.

295
00:18:00,707 --> 00:18:03,299
Speaker 1: You've got your shame if anything were to happen to it.

296
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:14,338
Speaker 1: But just bear in mind when you see these little strikes every time there is a short pointed protest strike That is wide-scale in the US.

297
00:18:14,398 --> 00:18:15,342
Speaker 1: now That is.

298
00:18:15,704 --> 00:18:18,695
Speaker 1: that is not the primary action like it is.

299
00:18:18,715 --> 00:18:20,200
Speaker 1: it is an action like it is a signal.

300
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:28,768
Speaker 1: It is a protest but that is primarily a signal saying if there is a general strike We will join it and saying we are capable of joining it.

301
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:37,816
Speaker 1: So keep an eye on People who bit by bit do little protest strikes in the coming months.

302
00:18:37,836 --> 00:18:41,088
Speaker 1: because there is a general strike You suck at protesting also, by the way, right?

303
00:18:41,149 --> 00:18:44,040
Speaker 0: I've got a country on earth is like way better at it than we are.

304
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:45,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have a Venezuelan co-workers.

305
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:46,893
Speaker 1: I see a lot of what's going on Venezuela.

306
00:18:47,094 --> 00:18:48,360
Speaker 1: They know how to fucking protest.

307
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:53,156
Speaker 0: Yeah, hey Korea, right South Korea their whole cut big people don't realize this.

308
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:54,440
Speaker 0: right South Korea?

309
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:58,453
Speaker 0: After the Korean War what kind of government do you think South Korea had?

310
00:18:58,493 --> 00:19:01,003
Speaker 0: basically a dictatorship is basically military Dictatorship.

311
00:19:01,103 --> 00:19:05,363
Speaker 1: until when I want to say the late sing early 70s I want to say more.

312
00:19:05,403 --> 00:19:07,792
Speaker 0: like the 80s right South Korea.

313
00:19:07,832 --> 00:19:09,157
Speaker 0: now is democracy.

314
00:19:09,257 --> 00:19:10,080
Speaker 0: ish, right?

315
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:10,942
Speaker 0: Yes, it's can.

316
00:19:11,002 --> 00:19:13,970
Speaker 0: it's more you it's pretty conservative and you know, whatever.

317
00:19:14,011 --> 00:19:15,715
Speaker 0: but they vote right is voting.

318
00:19:15,735 --> 00:19:16,598
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

319
00:19:16,859 --> 00:19:25,060
Speaker 0: so That happened because of pretty much all the changes in the South Korean government for the better are due to student protests.

320
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:30,480
Speaker 0: Right, basically, you know, it's a small country, but almost everyone comes out.

321
00:19:30,520 --> 00:19:34,675
Speaker 0: it's like Oh after work going down to the protest they all go and that's like.

322
00:19:34,695 --> 00:19:37,966
Speaker 0: it's like the after work activity and Like the note.

323
00:19:38,007 --> 00:19:39,960
Speaker 0: they get millions of people to shove to these things.

324
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,165
Speaker 1: Are you seeing little bits of that?

325
00:19:41,185 --> 00:19:42,873
Speaker 1: but only in big cities like in New York?

326
00:19:43,073 --> 00:19:48,900
Speaker 0: and the reason they do it Right is because they believe that it will work and then it does work, right?

327
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,198
Speaker 0: The government actually does something in response is why they do it, right?

328
00:19:53,661 --> 00:20:03,199
Speaker 0: Here I don't think people believe everyone who even people who agree with it believe it will work and That also, you know not believing it will work makes it not work, but you're seeing it a little bit like bit.

329
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,796
Speaker 0: And also will it work?

330
00:20:04,857 --> 00:20:05,160
Speaker 0: I don't know.

331
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:14,160
Speaker 1: I don't know if it'll work bit by bit like I'm seeing like in New York City at least like Spontaneous flash protests will spin up and get a lot many thousands of people in a hurry.

332
00:20:14,801 --> 00:20:15,645
Speaker 0: People want to go.

333
00:20:15,705 --> 00:20:17,313
Speaker 0: they just need someone to say where and when.

334
00:20:17,333 --> 00:20:19,000
Speaker 0: they'll say it's definitely happening Like.

335
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,370
Speaker 0: you just need that reassurance that like yes, we're all like.

336
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:22,711
Speaker 0: it's like.

337
00:20:22,731 --> 00:20:26,080
Speaker 0: imagine if like, you know, you forget protesting, right?

338
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,713
Speaker 0: You're gonna work and it's like you just want to leave.

339
00:20:28,733 --> 00:20:35,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, and But it's like, you know, it's it's the day before Thanksgiving, right and it's like three and normally get out at five.

340
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,460
Speaker 0: But you're like, yeah, can I just leave it three because tomorrow's Thanksgiving, right?

341
00:20:40,742 --> 00:20:42,147
Speaker 0: But like no one else is leaving.

342
00:20:42,549 --> 00:20:47,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if someone else leaves first and it's like ah, yeah I can leave now.

343
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:47,974
Speaker 1: I'm gonna break the seal.

344
00:20:48,115 --> 00:20:48,940
Speaker 0: you got to break the seal.

345
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,469
Speaker 0: So it's like everyone wants to leave.

346
00:20:51,489 --> 00:20:54,560
Speaker 0: Oh, right, but the seal has to be broken.

347
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:58,087
Speaker 1: So, uh, just take note be ready.

348
00:20:58,107 --> 00:21:01,879
Speaker 0: Most of the people listening are not people with jobs in America.

349
00:21:04,461 --> 00:21:07,325
Speaker 0: I think Of Australia.

350
00:21:07,345 --> 00:21:13,520
Speaker 0: if you take all of our listeners, I think that less than half of them are employed United States citizens.

351
00:21:14,383 --> 00:21:16,692
Speaker 1: See I would have agreed 49% or less.

352
00:21:16,792 --> 00:21:18,820
Speaker 1: I would agree with that eight or nine years ago.

353
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,248
Speaker 0: It could be 40% percent.

354
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:25,854
Speaker 1: a lot of our listeners Listen to us in high school, and I don't think I think you don't realize.

355
00:21:25,874 --> 00:21:31,648
Speaker 0: a lot of students a lot of unemployed Americans you do not realize how old we are now saying.

356
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:37,565
Speaker 0: the students the unemployed people and the non-americans will be 51% Or more.

357
00:21:37,585 --> 00:21:44,605
Speaker 1: we there are many people who were those kids a long time ago who are now adults with productive lives Whatever reason.

358
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,212
Speaker 0: they're still listening to that, you know, they got jobs.

359
00:21:46,754 --> 00:21:47,397
Speaker 1: I think they got job.

360
00:21:47,417 --> 00:21:47,859
Speaker 0: How do you know?

361
00:21:48,801 --> 00:21:49,664
Speaker 1: Talk about him in the forum.

362
00:21:49,704 --> 00:21:56,165
Speaker 1: Sometimes I know they're Americans, but it is you can definitely see based on who posts when Surprising number of Australians.

363
00:21:56,185 --> 00:21:57,831
Speaker 1: and I think it's just because we went to multiple packs.

364
00:21:57,932 --> 00:22:00,100
Speaker 0: Aussies like Australia is desperate for nerdery.

365
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:00,603
Speaker 0: We know this.

366
00:22:00,643 --> 00:22:04,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we went there and like people line up for now Like they got no nerdery there.

367
00:22:04,788 --> 00:22:05,692
Speaker 0: They don't have much of anything.

368
00:22:05,752 --> 00:22:07,380
Speaker 0: I'd import everything including the podcast.

389
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:08,380
Speaker 1: You're like, I wonder what's up with the W train?

Speaker 1: something something like.

391
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:10,230

Speaker 0: It's like a video of like something I see every goddamn day.

393
00:23:13,290 --> 00:23:14,028
Speaker 0: I don't need to watch it.

394
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:19,589
Speaker 0: But here's a video that showed up of something I hadn't seen which is if you don't know you probably don't.

395
00:23:20,514 --> 00:23:22,750
Speaker 0: In New York City, there is a train called the S train.

396
00:23:23,057 --> 00:23:23,489
Speaker 0: It's a shuttle.

397
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:29,012
Speaker 0: All it does is go to Grand Central and then it goes to Times Square and then it goes to Grand Central and then it Goes to Times Square.

398
00:23:29,032 --> 00:23:29,936
Speaker 0: It's got three tracks.

399
00:23:29,956 --> 00:23:33,430
Speaker 0: There's three trains just going back and forth back and forth back and forth.

400
00:23:33,570 --> 00:23:34,835
Speaker 0: That's all they do, right?

401
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:44,230
Speaker 0: So it's really convenient for like tourists or if it's raining Or you know those kinds of situations and it takes two seconds and it's like a five-minute walk.

402
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,435
Speaker 0: It's like a one-minute train.

403
00:23:45,897 --> 00:23:47,623
Speaker 0: So depending on where you happen to be standing.

404
00:23:47,684 --> 00:23:48,708
Speaker 0: It's might be convenient.

405
00:23:48,989 --> 00:23:51,997
Speaker 0: Whatever How do they get that train out of there?

406
00:23:52,198 --> 00:23:52,379
Speaker 0: Right?

407
00:23:52,419 --> 00:23:54,710
Speaker 0: It's like the train is stuck in this little back-and-forth track.

408
00:23:54,971 --> 00:23:58,230
Speaker 0: Yep, how do they get it out to the train yard if they need to fix it?

409
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:09,523
Speaker 1: So if you've been in New York Wait, one thing you will know is that there is this weird area where there's all these like beams and plates and you see track Goes under that like you can walk on it And there's track that goes under it and goes over to the one train.

410
00:24:10,005 --> 00:24:12,846
Speaker 0: So here's a video He found he went there DJ hammer.

411
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:31,856
Speaker 0: He's a train nerd at the time when they were getting that train out of there and removing the little floor, you know bridge Which is looks like a huge pain in the ass and they do it every few weeks Apparently and getting that as train out of there and then it's funny if you're a New Yorker to see the shuttle train Riding on the non shuttle track.

412
00:24:32,017 --> 00:24:35,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'd be like if you saw the space shuttle riding down the highway.

413
00:24:36,231 --> 00:24:37,396
Speaker 0: It's like it doesn't go there.

414
00:24:37,416 --> 00:24:39,303
Speaker 1: I mean we did see the space shuttle fly over.

415
00:24:39,323 --> 00:24:40,969
Speaker 0: There's a car in space.

416
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,129
Speaker 0: It's like a vehicle where it doesn't belong, right?

417
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:46,965
Speaker 1: Space is one cold motherfucker, right?

418
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:49,838
Speaker 1: So So this is a video.

419
00:24:50,039 --> 00:24:52,090
Speaker 1: It's making the rounds yesterday and today it was posted.

Speaker 0: It's real everyone's seen this.

422
00:24:57,651 --> 00:25:01,765
Speaker 1: I don't think everyone's saying oh, it's all because even in my company's slack how many views it's got.

423
00:25:02,186 --> 00:25:03,109
Speaker 1: It's already taken down.

424
00:25:03,952 --> 00:25:06,241
Speaker 1: Right, it only got 40,000 views.

425
00:25:06,603 --> 00:25:08,189
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's somewhere else to be seen.

426
00:25:09,071 --> 00:25:10,496
Speaker 1: It got taken down hard.

427
00:25:10,517 --> 00:25:11,842
Speaker 0: I'm sure you got it somewhere.

428
00:25:11,862 --> 00:25:13,830
Speaker 1: This video contains content from Sony Pictures.

429
00:25:15,896 --> 00:25:17,080
Speaker 0: Sony it'll be somewhere else.

430
00:25:17,402 --> 00:25:19,349
Speaker 1: Anyway, I'll link to the verge article about it.

431
00:25:19,891 --> 00:25:25,070
Speaker 1: But basically this video takes all the days from Groundhog Day, which is today.

432
00:25:25,351 --> 00:25:28,810
Speaker 1: We were yeah, if you couldn't guess also the two groundhogs disagreed with each other.

433
00:25:28,951 --> 00:25:30,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course shows you what they know.

434
00:25:30,599 --> 00:25:32,349
Speaker 1: We got to go to the Groundhog Electoral College.

435
00:25:32,389 --> 00:25:33,830
Speaker 0: now I'll go to my meteorologist.

436
00:25:35,550 --> 00:25:36,936
Speaker 1: So it take there.

437
00:25:36,956 --> 00:25:38,442
Speaker 1: so there's a similar video someone made.

438
00:25:38,482 --> 00:25:39,707
Speaker 1: there's a Rick and Morty episode.

439
00:25:40,049 --> 00:25:40,330
Speaker 1: where?

440
00:25:40,810 --> 00:25:49,590
Speaker 1: Like the multiverse splits and all the alternate realities and you keep zooming around like all the different permutations But they overlaid them all to show you the care that was put into that scene.

441
00:25:50,112 --> 00:26:01,678
Speaker 1: This is the same thing for the fantastic and brilliant movie Groundhog Day and it really highlights the ridiculous attention to detail They put into the overall theme and message of this movie.

442
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:10,130
Speaker 1: if you can find this video which was taken down in the last four hours By copyright, even though it's clearly fair use you can find it.

443
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:14,648
Speaker 1: You should definitely watch it because yeah, it only got 40,000 views for they haven't seen Groundhog Day.

444
00:26:14,688 --> 00:26:19,289
Speaker 1: Seriously Yeah, if you haven't seen Groundhog Day I guess don't watch this video because it'll spoil the fuck out of that movie.

445
00:26:19,973 --> 00:26:26,002
Speaker 1: But that movie is one of the classic movies for all time in my opinion And you should probably watch it if you've never watched it.

446
00:26:26,022 --> 00:26:26,585
Speaker 1: It's real good.

447
00:26:26,786 --> 00:26:27,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's funny.

448
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:31,841
Speaker 0: It's also serious and interesting and dated a little bit.

449
00:26:32,382 --> 00:26:32,904
Speaker 1: He was there.

450
00:26:32,964 --> 00:26:39,021
Speaker 1: someone figured out that based on the stuff he did Definitely at least 37 years of repeating that day.

451
00:26:39,343 --> 00:26:39,483
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

452
00:26:39,744 --> 00:26:40,908
Speaker 1: That's the number they came up with.

453
00:26:41,190 --> 00:26:42,415
Speaker 0: now I just spoil the move everybody.

454
00:26:42,937 --> 00:26:45,829
Speaker 1: I think people can figure but I don't think that spoils it.

455
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:47,926
Speaker 1: His change of heart is what spoils it?

456
00:26:50,511 --> 00:26:55,030
Speaker 1: In the moment the booklet book was Rebecca you can listen to the thing and watch the movie Rebecca.

457
00:26:55,578 --> 00:26:56,289
Speaker 1: It's about Rebecca.

458
00:26:58,794 --> 00:27:00,000
Speaker 1: I have not watched the movie yet.

459
00:27:00,281 --> 00:27:01,810
Speaker 1: Mmm, but I did see it as a kid.

460
00:27:02,433 --> 00:27:05,530
Speaker 1: I just have not watched it again since I read the book as an adult.

461
00:27:05,831 --> 00:27:09,130
Speaker 1: But that was the book club book and I'm gonna pick the next book club book.

462
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:16,269
Speaker 1: I think I'm leaning toward Dune because I've never actually read the first Dune book all the way through.

463
00:27:16,993 --> 00:27:19,850
Speaker 0: Neither did I only read like a chapter and it's like fuck this.

464
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:25,188
Speaker 1: But I know a lot about Dune and what I'm actually curious about is if I actually read the first Dune book.

465
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,561
Speaker 1: one How much do I actually know versus like?

466
00:27:28,621 --> 00:27:29,726
Speaker 1: I think I know but I'm wrong.

467
00:27:30,268 --> 00:27:32,496
Speaker 1: and two How much do I know?

468
00:27:32,516 --> 00:27:36,510
Speaker 1: that's actually from later Dune books, which I've heard are not that great?

469
00:27:36,851 --> 00:27:37,333
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

470
00:27:37,715 --> 00:27:40,586
Speaker 0: So find out but I think how many Dune books are there?

471
00:27:40,987 --> 00:27:41,449
Speaker 1: I don't know.

472
00:27:42,231 --> 00:27:44,677
Speaker 1: I know there's a bunch like this post Dune.

473
00:27:44,697 --> 00:27:53,109
Speaker 1: I But maybe maybe I'll make it do and I'm gonna decide soon.

474
00:27:53,971 --> 00:27:55,984
Speaker 1: Otherwise, check out my youtube video my youtube channel.

475
00:27:56,004 --> 00:27:56,890
Speaker 1: It's got youtube channel.

476
00:27:57,151 --> 00:27:58,254
Speaker 1: We got a whole bunch of stuff up.

477
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,320
Speaker 1: a rockin new forum is not informed.

478
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:06,556
Speaker 1: our front row crew calm but community dot front row crew Kaka, it's no longer Greek in nature.

479
00:28:06,576 --> 00:28:15,339
Speaker 1: Yeah, but forum dot front row crew calm is still up in stasis in perpetuity Every post until the end of the internet.

480
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:20,081
Speaker 1: Yep, or unless we both die and then our bank accounts run out If there's a ghost in the shell situation, don't worry.

481
00:28:20,142 --> 00:28:21,470
Speaker 0: I'll bring it into cyber land.

482
00:28:22,631 --> 00:28:23,434
Speaker 0: I'll port it over.

483
00:28:24,317 --> 00:28:30,299
Speaker 1: and the video of our quitting panel our newest panel We did it at magfest is up on YouTube.

484
00:28:30,841 --> 00:28:31,603
Speaker 1: You just watch it.

485
00:28:32,326 --> 00:28:35,484
Speaker 1: And if you missed our Grinding panel at PAX South.

486

Speaker 1: Well, guess what?

487

Speaker 1: We also did it at PAX Prime and guess what video of that one is already on YouTube.

488
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:49,492
Speaker 0: the next conventions are PAX East where we are doing a panel on winning and then That's it.

489
00:28:49,854 --> 00:28:55,501
Speaker 1: that's it until I guess packs unplugged and That's unplugged is after pecks west.

490
00:28:55,782 --> 00:29:00,563
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah pecks west, I guess Anime NYC is the same weekend as pecks unplugged.

491
00:29:00,583 --> 00:29:02,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then after that I guess magfest.

492
00:29:02,592 --> 00:29:03,438
Speaker 0: Are we gonna do that?

493
00:29:03,478 --> 00:29:05,170
Speaker 0: a con are we gonna do kinetic on?

494
00:29:05,430 --> 00:29:08,083
Speaker 1: I'm gonna I'll probably I think I will remain the head of the panels department.

495
00:29:08,103 --> 00:29:09,630
Speaker 0: I've seen kinek on making some movements.

496
00:29:10,172 --> 00:29:13,121
Speaker 1: Yep, the the sleeping giant is rumbling.

497
00:29:13,202 --> 00:29:14,686
Speaker 1: I'm guy have emails in my queue.

498
00:29:14,706 --> 00:29:15,629
Speaker 1: I have to respond to.

499
00:29:16,853 --> 00:29:21,930
Speaker 1: Actually panel submissions are open But if you go to the website, it still says kinetic on 2016 like everywhere.

500
00:29:22,372 --> 00:29:23,879
Speaker 1: But cuz I have no control over that.

501
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,270
Speaker 1: but trust me panel submissions are open.

502
00:29:26,450 --> 00:29:27,274
Speaker 1: I will link to it.

503
00:29:27,575 --> 00:29:30,225
Speaker 1: just start fucking submitting panels and I'll take care of it.

504
00:29:30,667 --> 00:29:39,418
Speaker 1: Trust me and Regardless of what the website might say about how comp badges work for panelists I will assure you they will work the same way.

505
00:29:39,459 --> 00:29:42,830
Speaker 1: They always have regardless of any language you might see somewhere.

506
00:29:43,972 --> 00:29:44,800
Speaker 1: And yeah, can I count?

507
00:29:44,921 --> 00:29:45,830
Speaker 1: I guess that's the one we forgot.

508
00:29:46,891 --> 00:29:50,126
Speaker 1: So I guess it's safe to assume by now that you've all seen Star Wars.

509
00:29:50,186 --> 00:29:50,669
Speaker 1: Rogue One.

510
00:29:51,191 --> 00:29:53,480
Speaker 0: I mean if you're a nerd you see everything you.

511
00:29:53,681 --> 00:29:58,383
Speaker 0: if something is Star Wars and it's official style Like you see it within 48 hours of it coming out.

512
00:29:58,403 --> 00:29:59,870
Speaker 0: You're on that shit nowadays.

513
00:30:00,031 --> 00:30:00,494
Speaker 0: I like that.

514
00:30:00,555 --> 00:30:01,723
Speaker 0: It's pretty much every Christmas.

515
00:30:01,743 --> 00:30:02,790
Speaker 0: There's a Star Wars something.

516
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:07,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, so now every create I don't you know, even if it comes out a couple weeks before then I just every Christmas.

517
00:30:07,550 --> 00:30:08,474
Speaker 0: now I'm going to Star Wars.

518
00:30:08,574 --> 00:30:10,663
Speaker 0: It's just like oh you've locked this in for me.

519
00:30:10,723 --> 00:30:10,904
Speaker 0: Now.

520
00:30:11,004 --> 00:30:15,882
Speaker 1: It's life is so convenient yep, so We're just gonna assume you saw it.

521
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:17,210
Speaker 1: Like we're not gonna worry about spoilers.

522
00:30:17,491 --> 00:30:28,521
Speaker 0: so I guess if you somehow didn't you can't spoil this if you've seen Star Wars Episode 4 because it's direct prequel to Star Wars Episode 4 it's the events that took place right before it.

523
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:31,510
Speaker 1: like immediately right before you could spoil a few notes.

524
00:30:31,590 --> 00:30:35,730
Speaker 1: Like I did not know some things that happened in it, of course, but we're assuming you saw it.

525
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:37,215
Speaker 1: We're not gonna explain the plot to you.

526
00:30:37,235 --> 00:30:40,848
Speaker 0: So the plot has problems, but not too many though.

527
00:30:41,009 --> 00:30:48,730
Speaker 1: Yeah I think I don't think the plot problems are actually too far out of the realm of every other mainline Star Wars movie.

528
00:30:49,232 --> 00:30:54,410
Speaker 0: No, no, I mean how many things did they just explain with like, you know magic, right?

529
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:55,253
Speaker 0: It's like you're gonna.

530
00:30:55,434 --> 00:30:56,498
Speaker 0: you're gonna just believe.

531
00:30:56,518 --> 00:30:57,422
Speaker 0: you're gonna.

532
00:30:57,462 --> 00:31:01,378
Speaker 0: you're gonna allow this believe in the force But you're not gonna believe in some other plot hole, right?

533
00:31:01,418 --> 00:31:01,639
Speaker 1: Yeah.

534
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, like come on, but overall I liked it a lot.

535
00:31:04,551 --> 00:31:06,630
Speaker 1: I actually liked it a lot more than the force awakens.

536
00:31:06,951 --> 00:31:13,177
Speaker 0: I also liked it more than force awakens and more than prequel movies But not more than any real Star Wars movie.

537
00:31:13,258 --> 00:31:18,510
Speaker 1: I think it's real close to being tied for the third best Star Wars movie, though I think it's real close.

538
00:31:18,615 --> 00:31:19,472
Speaker 0: No It's like.

539
00:31:19,492 --> 00:31:21,879
Speaker 0: so there's the three real Star Wars movies.

540
00:31:22,119 --> 00:31:25,710
Speaker 1: cuz honestly Empire Strikes Back is actually my favorite Star Wars movie.

541
00:31:26,413 --> 00:31:28,624
Speaker 0: I think it's always hard to say I like.

542
00:31:28,644 --> 00:31:29,709
Speaker 0: see the thing is a lot of you like.

543
00:31:29,830 --> 00:31:31,136
Speaker 1: I first react a lot.

544
00:31:31,317 --> 00:31:35,173
Speaker 1: then I watch A New Hope again, and I'm just like, oh, yeah I think part of this.

545
00:31:35,354 --> 00:31:46,430
Speaker 0: I think really we're not disagreeing here too much about the quality level of Rogue one so much as we're disagreeing about the quality level of Return of the Jedi true, which I like way more.

546
00:31:47,231 --> 00:31:49,229
Speaker 0: Then I might even be my number one, right?

547
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:56,530
Speaker 0: Because it's like people always think about you walks and I don't hate you walks First of all, but they forget about B wings and I fucking act bar, right?

548
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:58,698
Speaker 0: And also I made Oh being awesome.

549
00:31:58,738 --> 00:31:59,440
Speaker 0: Just the Emperor.

550
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:00,364
Speaker 0: The Emperor is my guy.

551
00:32:00,404 --> 00:32:00,665
Speaker 1: Yep.

552
00:32:00,685 --> 00:32:02,130
Speaker 1: You see those red guys, right?

553
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,922
Speaker 0: It's like come on you forgot that fire was in that movie.

554
00:32:05,002 --> 00:32:10,530
Speaker 0: It's like that's the best shit right there Anyway, but meanwhile, so basically three real Star Wars movies.

555
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:11,453
Speaker 0: then there's a big gap.

556
00:32:11,814 --> 00:32:12,697
Speaker 0: then there's still.

557
00:32:12,757 --> 00:32:18,053
Speaker 0: you're still in decent movie territory and you got the rogue one and then you've got the Force away.

558
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:20,065
Speaker 0: force awakens and not too far behind it.

559
00:32:20,105 --> 00:32:25,343
Speaker 0: really, you know I mean you got another big gap and then you got all the garbage but they go backwards.

560
00:32:25,383 --> 00:32:33,039
Speaker 1: then it's episode 3 then episode 2 Then episode 1, uh, you know Maybe this will be controversial.

561
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:36,836
Speaker 1: I mean both awful way which Both read carefully.

562
00:32:37,257 --> 00:32:40,990
Speaker 0: So episode 3 is obviously the best of the three shitty prequel movies.

563
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,898
Speaker 1: So you're gonna say that 2 is better than 1.

564
00:32:42,898 --> 00:32:44,866
Speaker 1: I'm going to say the one is better than 2.

565
00:32:44,866 --> 00:32:47,676
Speaker 0: that yes 1 & 2 are both crap.

566
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:52,352
Speaker 1: Yeah - yet - is worse than 1.

567
00:32:52,352 --> 00:32:54,044
Speaker 0: I was forced to watch one.

568
00:32:54,164 --> 00:32:57,698
Speaker 0: I would watch Phantom Menace rather than clone whatever.

569
00:32:57,879 --> 00:33:04,569
Speaker 1: Here's the problem - has higher highs than one did But it also has way lower lows.

570
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:08,500
Speaker 1: Mmm, maybe cuz 2 has some decent.

571
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:11,370
Speaker 0: anyway, we're here to talk about just Rogue One now, not all Star Wars.

572
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:17,070
Speaker 1: So I'm putting Rogue One way closer to Empire Strikes Back So in Rogue and way closer than Return of the Jedi, right?

573
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:21,029
Speaker 0: So in Rogue One, you basically have like a lot of stuff going on.

574
00:33:21,511 --> 00:33:26,930
Speaker 0: That is like these nostalgic callbacks that are like simultaneously good and bad.

575
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:31,121
Speaker 1: I would say that the majority of them are really subtle and really good in that they were.

576
00:33:34,953 --> 00:33:40,661
Speaker 1: So if you're a Star Wars nerd you're like But it doesn't get in the way it's just artistic right.

577
00:33:40,701 --> 00:33:41,666
Speaker 0: some of those are but like.

578
00:33:41,726 --> 00:33:42,510
Speaker 0: there's a handful.

579
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:44,980
Speaker 0: There's the guys that are like, I don't like you.

580
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:47,310
Speaker 0: I was about to say that's the only doesn't like you either.

581
00:33:47,451 --> 00:33:47,793
Speaker 0: Right

582
00:33:47,813 --> 00:33:47,854
Speaker 1: is

583
00:33:48,357 --> 00:33:52,762
Speaker 0: the bad one and to their credit I actually when I saw that scene I was like,

584
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:53,143
Speaker 1: uh,

585
00:33:53,385 --> 00:34:04,992
Speaker 0: but then I laughed well And then I actually forgot that scene was in the movie until someone mentioned it and then I was like Oh, you made me remember that awful part of the movie that awful five-second scene or whatever Right.

586
00:34:05,012 --> 00:34:07,804
Speaker 0: So all the shit that was like that was like distasteful.

587
00:34:07,824 --> 00:34:12,550
Speaker 1: I think there's very little of that though I think most of those callbacks were very artistically done.

588
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:27,036
Speaker 1: Yeah So anyway them because they did make sure like they tied the plot of this movie to you know Basically, they were foreshadowing the fact that this movie would literally fucking end with the minutes leading up to the opening of episode 4 Which I knew.

589
00:34:27,056 --> 00:34:29,570
Speaker 1: this was like the story of how they got the plans.

590
00:34:29,992 --> 00:34:34,389
Speaker 1: What I did not expect at all was the direct like second.

591
00:34:34,452 --> 00:34:34,949
Speaker 0: Oh really?

592
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:35,929
Speaker 1: continuity at the end.

593
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:40,809
Speaker 0: Oh, I know I basically knew that as soon as I knew them I didn't know the movie was about getting the plans.

594
00:34:40,969 --> 00:34:42,860
Speaker 0: I like all I knew about the movie going to see.

595
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,429
Speaker 0: it was like it's called rogue one.

596
00:34:44,510 --> 00:34:46,061
Speaker 0: It's gonna be all about x-wings and shit.

597
00:34:46,101 --> 00:34:47,330
Speaker 0: cuz you know rogue leader, right?

598
00:34:47,409 --> 00:34:54,094
Speaker 0: Yes I thought I was thinking about Rogue Squadron and all this other nerdy Star Wars knowledge I had and I was just like I was Ready for x-wings.

599
00:34:54,436 --> 00:34:58,594
Speaker 0: and then it's like oh, it's about that still has x-wings though But it's about that.

600
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:05,417
Speaker 0: and then I'm like, oh I'm like they're going to get the plans and the immediately think How does r2d2 get the plans?

601
00:35:05,739 --> 00:35:06,622
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like.

602
00:35:06,642 --> 00:35:07,746
Speaker 1: so you're trying back.

603
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:13,306
Speaker 1: You're just the whole movie You're watching right in time and you're thinking from the beginning of episode 4.

604
00:35:13,306 --> 00:35:14,350
Speaker 1: Where's the link, right?

605
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:18,764
Speaker 0: I'm like, I'm basically like oh How is how are these plans that they're going to obviously get?

606
00:35:18,845 --> 00:35:19,830
Speaker 0: because I know they get them.

607
00:35:20,112 --> 00:35:21,709
Speaker 0: I already know the end of the movie, right?

608
00:35:22,111 --> 00:35:24,498
Speaker 0: How did they get into r2d2's body?

609
00:35:24,979 --> 00:35:33,809
Speaker 0: and then I'm pretty much like as soon as I see they're having scenes like Mon Mothma And then I see and then I already knew I'm like, oh they're gonna like end the movie right at that.

610
00:35:34,170 --> 00:35:35,615
Speaker 0: They're gonna end the movie with that.

611
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:40,150
Speaker 0: and then you got scenes with like Leia's dad leaving to go to Alderaan or whatever.

612
00:35:40,351 --> 00:35:42,479
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm like, oh, okay.

613
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,607
Speaker 0: I mean, I think the thing is because I'm a nerd.

614
00:35:44,627 --> 00:35:48,039
Speaker 0: I Realized that that was Leia's adopted dad.

615
00:35:48,199 --> 00:35:51,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, and other people did not know that so they wouldn't write.

616
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:52,914
Speaker 0: It's like you get.

617
00:35:53,416 --> 00:35:56,566
Speaker 0: I guess being a Star Wars nerd makes the movie see.

618
00:35:56,586 --> 00:35:57,469
Speaker 1: so that's it those.

619
00:35:57,509 --> 00:36:03,034
Speaker 0: see I'm not even a crazy Star Wars nerd I just know as much as a nerd does and not as much as a Thing.

620
00:36:03,075 --> 00:36:03,500
Speaker 1: those scenes.

621
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:14,940
Speaker 1: when I went into the movie I knew the linkage but as the movie went on But I kept pushing the point where I thought the movie would end in the Star Wars world Further and further toward episode 4.

622
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:19,016
Speaker 0: I knew I mean I knew pretty as soon as I realized it I knew it would end at that.

623
00:36:19,297 --> 00:36:25,070
Speaker 1: but what I really appreciated was the fact, you know, like they all die Which I didn't know I sort of have to all die.

624
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:29,671
Speaker 0: There's no there's no they have to otherwise ever so they would have to be in episode 4.

625
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:33,445
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, you there were since there's this possibility in the attack on Yavin.

626
00:36:33,485 --> 00:36:36,135
Speaker 0: if they were not dead, of course Maybe they were.

627
00:36:36,155 --> 00:36:37,461
Speaker 1: no they weren't.

628
00:36:37,481 --> 00:36:38,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they weren't because they all died.

629
00:36:38,867 --> 00:36:40,834
Speaker 0: but it could have been You wouldn't?

630
00:36:40,854 --> 00:36:42,984
Speaker 0: you wouldn't fly Porkins if you could fly those people.

631
00:36:43,105 --> 00:36:48,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay You only got so many x-wings and your little rebel, you know pathetic band, right?

632
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:58,363
Speaker 1: the way the movie did it that last scene is probably my favorite scene in the movie because it just is this like like the Climax of the movie is the nuke is destroying the planet basically.

633
00:36:58,383 --> 00:37:08,927
Speaker 1: and then you just see this long Denim on of like the chain of custody of that hard drive all the way through to literally Carrie Fisher Fisher standing there the second

634
00:37:08,968 --> 00:37:09,974
Speaker 0: big Yeah,

635
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:20,542
Speaker 1: yeah she worked better than the target like half the time worked and half the time like would turn his head and like I Saw the skin on his nose like move a weird way,

636
00:37:20,743 --> 00:37:20,964
Speaker 0: right?

637
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:22,530
Speaker 0: So let's talk about these CG people.

638
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:28,342
Speaker 0: I see a lot of people praising the CG people and no doubt Half of Tarkin was like perfect like for a second.

639
00:37:28,402 --> 00:37:30,450
Speaker 1: I was like, holy shit, and then I was like, oh, right CG.

640
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:42,788
Speaker 0: So there is no doubt that that CG that was used for those the two characters was better than any Recreated character that has previously been made and I'm sure the people who made it worked very hard and are great animators.

641
00:37:43,169 --> 00:37:43,610
Speaker 0: good job.

642
00:37:43,710 --> 00:37:46,721
Speaker 0: We did the best you could with the technology that we have in the year 2016.

643
00:37:46,721 --> 00:37:47,022
Speaker 0: I applaud you.

644
00:37:47,103 --> 00:37:51,765
Speaker 0: However It's still obviously not a real person.

645
00:37:51,845 --> 00:37:55,990
Speaker 0: Tarkin worked For a few seconds because he's in the dark.

646
00:37:56,070 --> 00:38:04,310
Speaker 0: They put him in the dark to me and it worked when he was in the dark But as soon as like they showed light on his face, it's like obviously a digital person not a real person.

647
00:38:04,711 --> 00:38:06,681
Speaker 1: I would say he worked you did not cross.

648
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:11,610
Speaker 0: you failed to cross the uncanny valley Which I can't blame you for because no one's crossed it ever.

649
00:38:11,731 --> 00:38:17,422
Speaker 1: No, he worked in the light too But only when he was talking and not if he turned his head.

650
00:38:17,442 --> 00:38:18,846
Speaker 1: the problem is that?

651
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:20,090
Speaker 0: the main problem?

652
00:38:20,370 --> 00:38:23,968
Speaker 0: With doing it this way is not that it was necessarily bad.

653
00:38:24,852 --> 00:38:28,809
Speaker 0: It's that when you watch this shit again in ten years, it'll be remastered.

654
00:38:29,010 --> 00:38:37,114
Speaker 1: You either have to redo it because I guarantee every Will not hold up.

655
00:38:37,194 --> 00:38:38,377
Speaker 0: However, right?

656
00:38:38,437 --> 00:38:44,384
Speaker 0: This is why you know, normally I'm like, you know a technology person like hey Use the computer is the best right?

657
00:38:44,425 --> 00:38:44,909
Speaker 0: Why would you do?

658
00:38:45,130 --> 00:38:47,378
Speaker 0: Why would you make models like they did in the old days, right?

659
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:53,210
Speaker 0: And the reason the models work, you know It's like why go through the effort of the stupid models and you could use the computer.

660
00:38:53,911 --> 00:38:55,697
Speaker 0: It's because those models still hold up.

661
00:38:55,737 --> 00:38:56,681
Speaker 0: You never have to update it.

662
00:38:56,761 --> 00:38:58,025
Speaker 0: It's just still looks great.

663
00:38:58,066 --> 00:39:00,714
Speaker 0: No matter what year it is Right, whereas the computer shit.

664
00:39:01,035 --> 00:39:02,699
Speaker 0: go watch some Tron or something.

665
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:08,613
Speaker 0: even the super advanced can watch Toy Story 1. now, man Looks like PlayStation.

666
00:39:08,674 --> 00:39:14,270
Speaker 0: It's like it doesn't look as bad as PlayStation 1. like it's not good if you watch right, but you know.

667
00:39:14,350 --> 00:39:17,730
Speaker 0: So it's like that's you know, you think of Toy Story 1 came out.

668
00:39:17,830 --> 00:39:19,958
Speaker 0: It blew everyone away and it doesn't hold up.

669
00:39:20,018 --> 00:39:23,410
Speaker 0: So this even though it blew some people away will not hold up.

670
00:39:23,450 --> 00:39:25,035
Speaker 1: So I also think I noticed something.

671
00:39:25,497 --> 00:39:29,209
Speaker 1: people this is purely anecdotal people who didn't watch it in 3d.

672
00:39:30,152 --> 00:39:31,036
Speaker 1: They worked way better.

673
00:39:31,759 --> 00:39:33,024
Speaker 0: I did not see it in 3d.

674
00:39:33,385 --> 00:39:33,847
Speaker 1: I saw it in 3d.

675
00:39:34,570 --> 00:39:44,344
Speaker 0: I huge I'm parking skin not because I'm not because I'm anti 3d but because you know My mom would want to see in 3d and also in Connecticut the non 3d.

676
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:48,447
Speaker 0: the 2d ticket is so cheap It was like we want to see it at the fancy 84 street.

677
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:52,490
Speaker 0: This is like $8 like I. basically we had so much extra money.

678
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:54,422
Speaker 0: You could just buy a giant pile of quite a night even get.

679
00:39:54,463 --> 00:40:07,703
Speaker 1: we won't go to the theater anymore Unless it's either like a fancy theater showing something weird like the kids the New York International Children's Film Festival or something The 84th Street fancy theater or one of those like dinner and drink the.

680
00:40:07,763 --> 00:40:10,150
Speaker 0: I only go to special showings and Star Wars.

681
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:11,816
Speaker 1: So the Nighthawk theater has good stuff.

682
00:40:11,856 --> 00:40:15,330
Speaker 1: Like they'll do like midnight showings of vampire hunter D with like for real food.

683
00:40:16,512 --> 00:40:18,483
Speaker 0: But yeah, so what else about this movie?

684
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:19,810
Speaker 0: So the movie's got some plot holes.

685
00:40:20,551 --> 00:40:27,161
Speaker 0: You though they'd like and it has a lot of things that are kind of ridiculous and you started to push out of your Brain, the only ridiculous one is how the fuck did those two?

686
00:40:27,221 --> 00:40:29,130
Speaker 1: I don't like you people get the fuck off that planet.

687
00:40:29,271 --> 00:40:30,443
Speaker 1: No, no quick is that?

688
00:40:30,463 --> 00:40:30,665
Speaker 0: All right.

689
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:31,150
Speaker 0: So here you go.

690
00:40:31,150 --> 00:40:35,289
Speaker 0: So why is like the data stored like this physical hard drive?

691
00:40:35,309 --> 00:40:42,950
Speaker 1: because So look today if I want to give you a terabyte of data I could give it to you on this tiny ass little disk.

692
00:40:43,151 --> 00:40:50,478
Speaker 0: Why does it like look like a hard drive but then they can beam it and then it's on this little disk And they have to hand off and then stick physically and RDD.

693
00:40:50,519 --> 00:40:50,759
Speaker 0: it's like.

694
00:40:50,779 --> 00:40:54,169
Speaker 0: so Imagine their data storage doesn't make sense.

695
00:40:54,471 --> 00:40:54,913
Speaker 1: Here's how.

696
00:40:54,973 --> 00:40:55,877
Speaker 1: here's the way the thing is.

697
00:40:56,037 --> 00:40:58,528
Speaker 1: it is rationalizable for a lot of reasons.

698
00:40:58,568 --> 00:41:05,750
Speaker 1: for one Look at how fucking janky half the technology in the Star Wars universe is at this time in the air.

699
00:41:05,871 --> 00:41:12,184
Speaker 1: I mean they have like these amazing technological capabilities and lightsabers and all these fighters and everything.

700
00:41:12,606 --> 00:41:18,364
Speaker 1: and yet the Holographic projection capabilities are like worse than what we have today.

701
00:41:18,505 --> 00:41:19,870
Speaker 0: Okay, so here's another thing, right?

702
00:41:20,391 --> 00:41:23,367
Speaker 1: So the fidelity of data transmission is shit in that universe.

703
00:41:23,387 --> 00:41:23,507
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

704
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:26,800
Speaker 0: So the the dad right he put.

705
00:41:26,961 --> 00:41:29,570
Speaker 0: he built a weakness into the station and he had to hide it deep.

706
00:41:29,650 --> 00:41:37,601
Speaker 1: So the only place that data was was in like the fully unrendered like like anyway He said he said a message to his daughter and he was just like.

707
00:41:38,123 --> 00:41:38,404
Speaker 0: he's like.

708
00:41:38,625 --> 00:41:39,287
Speaker 0: there's a way to go.

709
00:41:39,327 --> 00:41:40,030
Speaker 0: get the instructions.

710
00:41:40,111 --> 00:41:40,895
Speaker 0: I had to blow this up.

711
00:41:40,936 --> 00:41:43,009
Speaker 0: He could have just told her here's how to blow it up.

712
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:49,247
Speaker 1: No, I don't think he could because I think the instructions were actually very detailed instructions.

713
00:41:49,808 --> 00:42:00,370
Speaker 0: Okay, however The plans fit as we saw on a little a thing that looked like basically a PlayStation Portable UMD disk right as far or a mini disk, right?

714
00:42:00,410 --> 00:42:02,643
Speaker 0: It's what it looked like when they were handing it off at the end, right?

715
00:42:02,925 --> 00:42:03,690
Speaker 0: It was not large.

716
00:42:04,051 --> 00:42:08,930
Speaker 0: It was in fact not significantly different in size from the holographic message.

717
00:42:09,271 --> 00:42:13,250
Speaker 0: He could have just sent that data and they wouldn't had to go to the planet and fight a battle to get it.

718
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:18,143
Speaker 1: I will bet he did not have access to that data because he made the data.

719
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:24,164
Speaker 1: if it's a military system with an air gap Probably that data is only accessible physically at that location.

720
00:42:24,566 --> 00:42:27,216
Speaker 1: I'm just saying Couldn't smuggle the data.

721
00:42:27,236 --> 00:42:29,970
Speaker 0: the place that they went to get the data from was like the archive.

722
00:42:30,031 --> 00:42:31,868
Speaker 0: That'd be like going to the Library of Congress to get it.

723
00:42:32,183 --> 00:42:39,050
Speaker 1: No It'd be more like remember in Mission Impossible Where they he goes into the server room that has no connection to the outside world to steal some data.

724
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,034
Speaker 1: It's that situation.

725
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:42,042
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm that data had to be created somewhere else.

726
00:42:42,082 --> 00:42:44,009
Speaker 0: it the person who made the data wasn't in that room.

727
00:42:44,912 --> 00:42:49,949
Speaker 1: Ah, that data was probably created in an air gap facility of some kind and then pieces of it were rendered out as needed.

728
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:51,313
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I can.

729
00:42:51,774 --> 00:42:56,348
Speaker 1: it is possible to nerd rationalize that way easier than some shit that happens.

730
00:42:56,388 --> 00:42:58,956
Speaker 0: episode 4 5 You're saying you got to jump through some hoops.

731
00:42:59,417 --> 00:43:03,930
Speaker 1: It's there is no plot point except for how did those two like serial killing?

732
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:07,300
Speaker 1: Bar-dwelling monsters get off of that planet in time.

733
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:08,805
Speaker 0: Okay, so here's some other shit, right?

734
00:43:08,865 --> 00:43:12,457
Speaker 0: So, uh Characters right the droid.

735
00:43:12,477 --> 00:43:13,300
Speaker 0: It's the best car.

736
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:13,782
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

737
00:43:13,802 --> 00:43:16,070
Speaker 1: He was the best ever like I want.

738
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:20,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, why don't I get a phaser or a blaster like that was my favorite line of his.

739
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:21,070
Speaker 1: why don't I get a blaster?

740
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:22,858
Speaker 0: Anyway, he was like the best character.

741
00:43:23,059 --> 00:43:24,306
Speaker 0: like that's the person you want to buy.

742
00:43:24,346 --> 00:43:28,190
Speaker 1: an action figure Won't even tell them that he's in trouble.

743
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:33,890
Speaker 1: He's just like shooting stormtrooper Nazis over his shoulder while he's like sacrificing his life taking out the data, right?

744
00:43:34,011 --> 00:43:35,527
Speaker 0: So that guy's awesome.

745
00:43:35,587 --> 00:43:35,789
Speaker 0: Yeah.

746
00:43:36,570 --> 00:43:39,281
Speaker 0: However, a lot of the other characters are kind of like.

747
00:43:39,542 --> 00:43:40,687
Speaker 0: I don't really care about you, right?

748
00:43:41,830 --> 00:43:44,144
Speaker 1: I cared about pilot guy main girl.

749
00:43:44,164 --> 00:43:46,415
Speaker 0: I Cared about droid guy.

750
00:43:46,496 --> 00:43:49,087
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what I cared about Mon Mothma.

751
00:43:49,107 --> 00:43:52,023
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean, I already cared about Mon Mothma in advance.

752
00:43:52,163 --> 00:43:52,927
Speaker 1: I care about my mouth.

753
00:43:52,988 --> 00:43:54,677
Speaker 1: as a kid I was obsessed with Mon Mothma.

754
00:43:54,797 --> 00:43:57,110
Speaker 0: I was a gender Donna like who is that guy?

755
00:43:57,450 --> 00:43:59,868
Speaker 0: And now I know now I know his name without having to look it up every time.

756
00:44:00,914 --> 00:44:01,940
Speaker 0: I was like who is that guy?

757
00:44:01,980 --> 00:44:03,187
Speaker 0: He wasn't in the movie until now.

758
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:03,710
Speaker 0: What does he do?

759
00:44:05,195 --> 00:44:08,186
Speaker 1: My biggest my three biggest obsessions were in order.

760
00:44:08,286 --> 00:44:09,169
Speaker 1: number one Boba Fett.

761
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:12,477
Speaker 1: Number two the red guys red guys.

00:44:12,517 --> 00:44:13,018
Speaker 0: number one.

763
00:44:13,099 --> 00:44:14,403
Speaker 1: number three Mon Mothma.

764
00:44:14,603 --> 00:44:16,028
Speaker 1: I was like she's in charge.

765
00:44:16,048 --> 00:44:16,730
Speaker 1: Like what's her deal?

766
00:44:17,111 --> 00:44:17,252
Speaker 1: Why?

767
00:44:17,313 --> 00:44:17,858
Speaker 1: what's going on?

768
00:44:17,898 --> 00:44:18,301
Speaker 1: How the rub?

769
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:19,290
Speaker 1: What's the structure?

770
00:44:20,312 --> 00:44:23,714
Speaker 0: Mon Mothma the movie 2023.

771
00:44:23,714 --> 00:44:24,539
Speaker 1: I'll watch it.

772
00:44:24,781 --> 00:44:28,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's maybe the best one But I want to see Akbar the movie.

773
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:29,681
Speaker 0: so I noticed something.

774
00:44:29,862 --> 00:44:39,699
Speaker 1: the whole movie the whole Star Wars episode 30 Notice something really interesting and I suspect it's on purpose and some Star Wars nerd Probably can figure this out way better than I can.

775
00:44:39,980 --> 00:44:40,944
Speaker 1: so, you know the red guys, right?

776
00:44:40,964 --> 00:44:41,687
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm there.

777
00:44:41,707 --> 00:44:42,210
Speaker 1: What are they?

778
00:44:42,710 --> 00:44:44,256
Speaker 0: They're the Imperial like guards.

779
00:44:44,577 --> 00:44:51,159
Speaker 0: They're like they'd like the high bird like the Emperor's personal dude like the Secret Service Basically, so did you notice that?

780
00:44:51,380 --> 00:44:54,430
Speaker 1: you know, the Jedi religion is defunct in rogue one?

781
00:44:54,714 --> 00:44:56,034
Speaker 1: Yes but there are people.

782
00:44:56,294 --> 00:45:03,155
Speaker 1: try like we have a couple characters who are trying to keep the remnants of it alive and there are Obviously like it is still a religion.

783
00:45:03,175 --> 00:45:07,967
Speaker 1: It's just the religion does not have it's not it's not completely forgotten.

784
00:45:08,007 --> 00:45:08,950
Speaker 0: people remember it.

785
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:13,270
Speaker 0: It is no it is a religion, but there are not practitioners like if it's right.

786
00:45:13,350 --> 00:45:20,620
Speaker 0: It's like if there are people who still believed or knew about Catholicism and like, you know, but the church is gone But there's no Pope and there's no church.

787
00:45:20,660 --> 00:45:21,143
Speaker 0: and there's no.

788
00:45:21,163 --> 00:45:22,370
Speaker 0: you know, there's no church.

789
00:45:22,370 --> 00:45:29,754
Speaker 1: You can't go to church in town that many of the people Proselytizing in the streets of Jeddah We're dressed in.

790
00:45:30,095 --> 00:45:33,809
Speaker 1: they were dressed in ways that are really evocative of what those red guys dress like.

791
00:45:34,392 --> 00:45:38,459
Speaker 1: Mmm, I wonder if those red guys There's probably like some other religion.

792
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:39,924
Speaker 1: Oh, no that that's like.

793
00:45:39,944 --> 00:45:41,008
Speaker 0: the dark side is a different.

794
00:45:41,048 --> 00:45:43,230
Speaker 0: religion believes in the force.

795
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:46,780
Speaker 1: It's like easily say that the red guys like the church.

796
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:55,768
Speaker 1: the church of the of this stuff still existed but only an imperial Precincts for like Darth Vader and all that nonsense in its ceremony for church.

797
00:45:56,009 --> 00:45:58,958
Speaker 1: Yeah But basically that that I know.

798
00:45:58,978 --> 00:46:02,310
Speaker 0: I want to believe in the Sith Church, but I think you're just stretching it now.

799
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:09,664
Speaker 1: but why was that type of regalia and garb shown multiple times by the remnants of the Jedi religion.

800
00:46:09,704 --> 00:46:12,154
Speaker 0: as it looks it looks Star Wars II Yeah, and it ties.

801
00:46:12,214 --> 00:46:13,039
Speaker 1: it doesn't matter why.

802
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:15,010
Speaker 1: the fact is that continuity was there and I saw it.

803
00:46:15,271 --> 00:46:16,738
Speaker 0: So I do like how they kept.

804
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,050
Speaker 0: like the whole thing with the crystals, right?

805
00:46:19,653 --> 00:46:20,579
Speaker 0: It's like I knew that right.

806
00:46:20,599 --> 00:46:22,550
Speaker 0: as soon as they're like, oh, yeah, they need crystals.

807
00:46:22,550 --> 00:46:24,745
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah, you need the crystals that you make lightsabers with.

808
00:46:24,805 --> 00:46:25,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what you need.

809
00:46:25,872 --> 00:46:26,717
Speaker 0: It's like oh they kept.

810
00:46:26,737 --> 00:46:27,602
Speaker 0: they totally kept that.

811
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:28,910
Speaker 0: so if you're a nerd you knew it already.

812
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:31,914
Speaker 0: And also right.

813
00:46:31,934 --> 00:46:32,697
Speaker 0: so Donnie Yen.

814
00:46:33,139 --> 00:46:33,841
Speaker 0: He's my guy.

815
00:46:33,901 --> 00:46:36,731
Speaker 0: in most movies like it man an iron monkey Like.

816
00:46:36,751 --> 00:46:37,413
Speaker 0: I love this guy.

817
00:46:37,433 --> 00:46:37,835
Speaker 0: He's good.

818
00:46:38,216 --> 00:46:42,208
Speaker 0: But in this movie, I didn't like his character so much.

819
00:46:42,228 --> 00:46:42,730
Speaker 1: I like that guy.

820
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:52,378
Speaker 0: Okay, I like him right as actor but his character I didn't like cuz I felt it was sort of like Stereotypical mystical martial arts Asian guy.

821
00:46:52,478 --> 00:46:56,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, like oh the blind master and it seemed like a caricature.

822
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:57,838
Speaker 0: And I was sort of like man.

823
00:46:57,918 --> 00:47:00,570
Speaker 0: and also he didn't his you didn't have like a personality.

824
00:47:01,032 --> 00:47:05,710
Speaker 0: That made me like him the way the the droid did right the little that you saw of his character.

825
00:47:05,951 --> 00:47:11,613
Speaker 0: I wish that he would have had like a like a pi may kind of character or even though he's even pi maze even more Of a stereotype.

826
00:47:11,874 --> 00:47:13,562
Speaker 0: at least pi may is so fucking badass.

827
00:47:13,782 --> 00:47:15,048
Speaker 0: you love him and just want to see him.

828
00:47:15,088 --> 00:47:15,510
Speaker 0: all the time.

829
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:20,849
Speaker 1: They hinted at all the backstories and relationships between these sets of characters without showing them to you.

830
00:47:21,452 --> 00:47:25,310
Speaker 1: So the problem is if you're like if you watch these characters you like them at all.

831
00:47:25,370 --> 00:47:28,350
Speaker 1: You kind of want to know what their deals are and you don't get to see any of that.

832
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:28,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, I want to know.

833
00:47:28,974 --> 00:47:37,461
Speaker 0: I want to know the droids deal is but I don't want to know what else's deal is yeah, but then again, I do think though the A big part of Star Wars as a whole is.

834
00:47:37,762 --> 00:47:38,606
Speaker 1: here's the character.

835
00:47:38,907 --> 00:47:39,690
Speaker 1: They seem cool.

836
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:42,003
Speaker 1: You don't know their deal and you never fucking find out their deal.

837
00:47:42,184 --> 00:47:42,305
Speaker 0: Right?

838
00:47:42,345 --> 00:47:45,434
Speaker 0: Well, there's the I Forget his name, right?

839
00:47:45,474 --> 00:47:48,844
Speaker 0: He's the guy who was like even more to rebel for anybody.

840
00:47:48,885 --> 00:47:51,717
Speaker 0: He rescued the girl at the beginning Oh, yeah, you know.

841
00:47:51,757 --> 00:47:53,570
Speaker 0: and then he was like the basically like crazy.

842
00:47:53,630 --> 00:48:04,100
Speaker 1: I saw a good critique from a writer about how he was a weirdly like Appropriative of Black Panther like black resistance movements in that.

843
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,970
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah that guy happens to be the one who's too extreme for the rebels.

844
00:48:08,311 --> 00:48:08,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's true.

845
00:48:09,215 --> 00:48:15,980
Speaker 0: He definitely seemed like a character I had seen before in that role in many other Soon like he could have escaped with them and help fight.

846
00:48:16,281 --> 00:48:17,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he just gave up for no reason.

847
00:48:17,907 --> 00:48:18,750
Speaker 0: That is also true.

848
00:48:18,810 --> 00:48:23,630
Speaker 0: He seemed a lot like, you know, like he gave up way too kind of any seven with a gun for a hand.

849
00:48:24,151 --> 00:48:26,558
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's like the same exact character.

850
00:48:26,598 --> 00:48:29,085
Speaker 0: Basically you've seen a hundred times before Barrett, right?

851
00:48:29,105 --> 00:48:32,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, but Even though that's all true.

852
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,550
Speaker 0: I think he's this character.

853
00:48:34,610 --> 00:48:40,150
Speaker 0: I like the second most because he at least was interesting and also he was fighting the Nazis while everyone else was equivocating.

854
00:48:40,411 --> 00:48:44,163
Speaker 1: Sure, he was like, I'm a fight with my weird slug brain monster.

855
00:48:44,183 --> 00:48:44,784
Speaker 0: Yeah.

856
00:48:44,965 --> 00:48:45,888
Speaker 0: Yeah the slug brain was.

857
00:48:45,928 --> 00:48:46,570
Speaker 0: that was just weird.

858
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:48,038
Speaker 0: It's like Star Wars II nonsense.

859
00:48:48,098 --> 00:48:48,340
Speaker 0: It is.

860
00:48:48,501 --> 00:48:50,170
Speaker 0: it is Star Wars II nonsense, right?

861
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:52,023
Speaker 0: It's like Java thought just has this monster this guy.

862
00:48:52,044 --> 00:48:52,850
Speaker 0: He just has a monster.

863
00:48:53,332 --> 00:48:57,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, people just have monsters but that monsters that are useful to them.

864
00:48:57,150 --> 00:48:59,504
Speaker 0: That is the I mean saga has that to lion cat.

865
00:48:59,625 --> 00:49:08,110
Speaker 1: that is the primary Character plot hole that bothered me was that he the like the fighter the person who is like fighting above all else.

866
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:10,034
Speaker 0: Final Fantasy 4.

867
00:49:10,034 --> 00:49:14,710
Speaker 1: I do like Final Fantasy 4, but the fact that that dude just fucking gives up that the same thing.

868
00:49:15,092 --> 00:49:16,439
Speaker 1: No, this check this guy just gives up.

869
00:49:16,499 --> 00:49:17,626
Speaker 0: I'll open this door for you.

870
00:49:17,907 --> 00:49:21,119
Speaker 1: Yeah But he doesn't sacrifice like he doesn't.

871
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:24,430
Speaker 1: it's not like he blows himself up to let them all escape.

872
00:49:24,852 --> 00:49:26,200
Speaker 1: He just doesn't escape with them.

873
00:49:26,904 --> 00:49:32,670
Speaker 1: Well, his body was old He was not in good health, but he decided to give up right then right when like something there's a real chance.

874
00:49:32,710 --> 00:49:38,546
Speaker 0: I guess he figured like, you know this is the reason I was staying alive with this unhealthy painful uncomfortable body was to accomplish this.

875
00:49:38,646 --> 00:49:41,866
Speaker 0: and now that you've got now that You're here and I've given you the thing you've gotten away.

876
00:49:41,886 --> 00:49:46,673
Speaker 0: now I don't have to bother staying alive anymore and living a suffering horrible life Maybe pain.

877
00:49:46,874 --> 00:49:48,219
Speaker 1: you could have fought a little bit longer.

878
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:52,977
Speaker 0: But even though I just said that that was not clear in the movie Yeah, he didn't express like.

879
00:49:53,037 --> 00:49:55,647
Speaker 0: oh, he didn't say like, you know have a little monologue.

880
00:49:55,667 --> 00:49:58,278
Speaker 0: We're like, yeah, listen I'm living every day the shitty ass body.

881
00:49:58,438 --> 00:50:01,290
Speaker 0: It's very I'm just trying to stay alive so I could get this message.

882
00:50:01,552 --> 00:50:03,110
Speaker 0: Now that I have I can die in peace.

883
00:50:03,230 --> 00:50:08,529
Speaker 1: It would be very on the Star Wars to have the characters all express their motivations that succinctly.

884
00:50:08,838 --> 00:50:10,694
Speaker 1: Yes Like that would literally ruin.

885
00:50:10,755 --> 00:50:10,875
Speaker 1: like.

886
00:50:11,196 --> 00:50:13,823
Speaker 1: and think about episode 4. obi-wan like.

887
00:50:13,883 --> 00:50:16,370
Speaker 1: his motivations are not a hundred percent.

888
00:50:16,410 --> 00:50:18,598
Speaker 0: Well, that's exactly what obi-wan did do.

889
00:50:18,658 --> 00:50:20,745
Speaker 0: obi-wan is like, yeah, that's all right.

890
00:50:20,765 --> 00:50:21,287
Speaker 0: Luke's got this.

891
00:50:21,348 --> 00:50:21,930
Speaker 0: I can die now.

892
00:50:22,135 --> 00:50:23,795
Speaker 0: Yep I'll die so you can get away.

893
00:50:23,975 --> 00:50:25,982
Speaker 1: but he did it with subtlety and actin.

894
00:50:26,183 --> 00:50:32,043
Speaker 0: just by what he turns looks at Luke because the Obi-wan was a thousand times better actor than anyone.

895
00:50:32,123 --> 00:50:41,309
Speaker 1: this day whenever I watch episode 4 There's that one moment where Ben Kenobi raises the eyebrow and all I can think is wow You can fucking act and no one else in this movie can really do it.

896
00:50:41,490 --> 00:50:44,381
Speaker 0: No, Harrison Ford a little bit a little bit but old.

897
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:46,690
Speaker 1: but Harrison Ford kind of plays the same dude most of the time.

898
00:50:46,892 --> 00:50:52,523
Speaker 0: Yes, but he can do it But only Ben Kenobi and also as great actors Alec Guinness is.

899
00:50:53,184 --> 00:50:55,130
Speaker 0: he doesn't play too many different dudes.

900
00:50:56,233 --> 00:50:57,096
Speaker 0: Go watch like was it?

901
00:50:57,116 --> 00:50:59,825
Speaker 0: bridge over the river qua is the one he's in or is it?

902
00:51:00,287 --> 00:51:01,190
Speaker 0: I think that's the one he's in.

903
00:51:01,310 --> 00:51:01,751
Speaker 0: Let me check.

904
00:51:02,112 --> 00:51:03,757
Speaker 0: Yeah, where he's he's?

905
00:51:03,978 --> 00:51:06,284
Speaker 0: uh, you know, he's an army guy.

906
00:51:06,444 --> 00:51:15,530
Speaker 0: him and Peter Cushing are like the actors Cushing the same actor also and everything go watch Dracula and it's just like oh look, it's grandma truck in the vampire.

907
00:51:17,291 --> 00:51:33,745
Speaker 1: But I think what another thing I really appreciate about this movie was that you watch episode 4 and There's you know, it starts in media res with a certain sense of urgency but then it does it sort of rambling around the fact that this movie sort of adds this like Really extra sense of urgency like

908
00:51:33,765 --> 00:51:34,570
Speaker 0: his bridge over there require.

909
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:35,013
Speaker 0: I was right.

910
00:51:35,174 --> 00:51:52,399
Speaker 1: the fact that like you could just put these two movies together and It's just like what the fuck how they gonna stop the Death Star like oh my god Like it sort of implies this huge chain of constant urgency Throughout like leading up to the destruction of the Death Star at the end of episode 4 That you wouldn't have gotten without a prequel like this.

911
00:51:52,419 --> 00:52:00,082
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm cuz episode 4 could have been like long build up and plans are found and then like oh we get him.

912
00:52:00,102 --> 00:52:05,870
Speaker 1: and now like the urge like it felt like the rebels had The initiative and the Death Star came out of them in reaction to that.

913
00:52:05,950 --> 00:52:07,555
Speaker 1: But you watch this movie and now it's.

914
00:52:07,856 --> 00:52:13,137
Speaker 1: no the Nazis like the Death Star is on its way real fucking quick and like you Got a move.

915
00:52:13,157 --> 00:52:13,643
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

916
00:52:15,451 --> 00:52:21,970
Speaker 1: All I wanted to do when the credits rolled was immediately watch episode 4 like I felt this powerful urge.

917
00:52:22,371 --> 00:52:23,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, immediately.

918
00:52:23,797 --> 00:52:34,440
Speaker 1: the main complaint I saw from people that seemed legitimate But I actually have a counterpoint to it was a lot of people were saying the soundtrack was uninspired Lame boring not up to the John Williams stand.

919
00:52:34,941 --> 00:52:35,784
Speaker 1: It wasn't John Williams.

920
00:52:35,844 --> 00:52:37,369
Speaker 0: So first of all, wasn't it John Williams?

921
00:52:37,509 --> 00:52:38,680
Speaker 1: No Oh, I thought it was.

922
00:52:38,701 --> 00:52:39,590
Speaker 1: it was Michael Giacchino.

923
00:52:39,871 --> 00:52:43,683
Speaker 0: Also, I heard this is apparently as far as I know this is true.

924
00:52:43,723 --> 00:52:45,349
Speaker 0: John Williams has never watched a Star Wars movie.

925
00:52:45,369 --> 00:52:49,457
Speaker 1: I Will not make any comment on that.

926
00:52:49,538 --> 00:52:54,876
Speaker 0: that's what I heard but anyway until I verify cuz I don't know I mostly agree with those people.

927
00:52:54,976 --> 00:52:57,143
Speaker 0: there were a few moments right but there was.

928
00:52:57,243 --> 00:52:59,550
Speaker 0: no I can't hum for you a goddamn song.

929
00:52:59,691 --> 00:53:03,109
Speaker 1: So I did agree, but I noticed something and I have not.

930
00:53:03,169 --> 00:53:05,618
Speaker 1: yet I get to listen to the rogue one soundtrack.

931
00:53:05,778 --> 00:53:08,428
Speaker 1: I did own on Spotify and think about this.

932
00:53:08,969 --> 00:53:11,201
Speaker 1: I have this feeling cuz I noticed something.

933
00:53:11,221 --> 00:53:16,930
Speaker 1: people complained that the soundtrack was muddy and That it didn't have a lot of in that it didn't have a lot of strong clear melodies.

934
00:53:17,201 --> 00:53:19,388
Speaker 0: Yes it was doesn't definitely doesn't have the strong clear melody.

935
00:53:19,448 --> 00:53:31,270
Speaker 1: but something I noticed was that the way it seemed to work is it had all these motifs sort of blended together all the time and They would occasionally edge toward a more recognizable Star Wars theme and but in an edge away, right?

936
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:34,004
Speaker 1: It's like like they'd be like it's almost gonna be Leia's team.

937
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:39,083
Speaker 0: You know, it's No, even the actual Star Wars soundtrack.

938
00:53:39,123 --> 00:53:43,782
Speaker 0: go listen to like the episode 5 soundtrack Yeah, and you'll be listening to like Yoda's theme.

939
00:53:44,104 --> 00:53:51,117
Speaker 0: and in Yoda's theme They're like hint it like, you know some you know, main Star Wars Right.

940
00:53:51,157 --> 00:53:54,530
Speaker 0: It's like they're coming in all the time in every song, right?

941
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:55,895
Speaker 0: It's like you'll hear.

942
00:53:56,177 --> 00:53:58,186
Speaker 0: you know Imperial March sneak its way in.

943
00:53:58,226 --> 00:53:59,190
Speaker 0: you hear a little right, you know.

944
00:53:59,190 --> 00:53:59,868
Speaker 1: What actually does that?

945
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,518
Speaker 0: And I'm gonna say it even though it was the same movie.

946
00:54:03,558 --> 00:54:07,650
Speaker 1: so Undertale score does that equally well to Star Wars.

947
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,338
Speaker 0: that's interesting, but that's like.

948
00:54:09,358 --> 00:54:14,796
Speaker 1: the main reason to play Undertale is the soundtrack the This movie right.

949
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:16,442
Speaker 0: it sneaks in even less.

950
00:54:16,483 --> 00:54:17,426
Speaker 0: It's not even like motif.

951
00:54:17,467 --> 00:54:18,290
Speaker 0: It's like an extra light.

952
00:54:18,410 --> 00:54:21,019
Speaker 0: I think that's on purpose even if it's on purpose.

953
00:54:21,541 --> 00:54:22,083
Speaker 0: I don't like it.

954
00:54:22,324 --> 00:54:23,809
Speaker 0: I have a purpose is good.

955
00:54:23,829 --> 00:54:31,317
Speaker 1: Sure I don't know if this is true and I have not even like tried to verify this either by listening and figuring out of my Own or by reading what other people have written.

956
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:34,170
Speaker 1: my suspicion is that Giacchino?

957
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,113
Speaker 1: Tried to do too much with it.

958
00:54:36,615 --> 00:54:51,157
Speaker 1: It sounds to me like this soundtrack was purposefully muddy and purposely like Evoking Star Wars, but not being Star Wars even as a long I'd rather I don't like that as a long slow Musical build-up to like.

959
00:54:51,479 --> 00:54:55,816
Speaker 1: the themes of Star Wars are still resolving themselves Because they eventually resolve.

960
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:59,130
Speaker 1: at the very end of this movie you get the Star Wars theme.

961
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:05,870
Speaker 1: It's like all these factors all these people all these circumstances have to come together to make the Star Wars happen

962
00:55:06,353 --> 00:55:06,534
Speaker 0: And I

963
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:20,181
Speaker 1: I would guess that Michael Giacchino Was just trying to be too clever in a way that the vast majority audience would not get and that even if you get it You might appreciate the effort but not appreciate the result

964
00:55:20,522 --> 00:55:23,030
Speaker 0: the X if even if that was the plan, right?

965
00:55:23,251 --> 00:55:26,708
Speaker 0: it's like it doesn't matter because Execution it didn't work.

966
00:55:26,788 --> 00:55:35,935
Speaker 1: now I like the soundtrack and it did work for me But only because I felt like it resolved into the strong themes Right at the end of the also.

967
00:55:35,995 --> 00:55:39,508
Speaker 0: that would have worked better if episode this is a star wars didn't exist.

968
00:55:39,528 --> 00:55:43,667
Speaker 1: because right Oh, I'm pretending they don't as far as I don't and this is the first Star Wars.

969
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:45,317
Speaker 1: Yeah I just died.

970
00:55:45,478 --> 00:55:47,029
Speaker 1: This was so much better than them.

971
00:55:47,512 --> 00:55:54,442
Speaker 0: You know the other problem and this is I think the biggest problem with this movie There is no opening crawl on this movie.

972
00:55:54,622 --> 00:55:56,790
Speaker 1: that's because this is not a mainline Star Wars movie.

973
00:55:57,091 --> 00:55:58,616
Speaker 1: It is a Star Wars story.

974
00:55:58,697 --> 00:55:59,399
Speaker 0: I don't give a fuck.

975
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:10,094
Speaker 1: My the bigger concern is if episode if episode seven eight eight Starts right where six four seven left off Mm-hmm.

976
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:11,990
Speaker 1: What are they gonna put in that crawl?

977
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,040
Speaker 1: You just watched a movie and now we're going to continue with the next scene.

978
00:56:18,502 --> 00:56:20,434
Speaker 0: I mean they could just sum up the events of.

979
00:56:20,454 --> 00:56:29,460
Speaker 0: I mean It says in the crawl of any Star Wars movie Don't remember offhand cuz you just don't like yeah, you ever actually read those things?

980
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,008
Speaker 0: You just need the yellow words to go past.

981
00:56:31,028 --> 00:56:32,235
Speaker 0: They could be drunk and gibberish.

982
00:56:32,476 --> 00:56:33,179
Speaker 0: You don't even care.

983
00:56:34,806 --> 00:56:37,174
Speaker 0: And the reason the crawl didn't go by you know, why is?

984
00:56:37,375 --> 00:56:38,780
Speaker 0: because we just talked about this.

985
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,992
Speaker 0: It's a Star Wars story because the soundtrack they couldn't.

986
00:56:41,072 --> 00:56:45,553
Speaker 1: they want to put that song there Yeah, but you couldn't because it wasn't Star Wars yet.

987
00:56:45,613 --> 00:56:46,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can put the song there.

988
00:56:47,161 --> 00:56:48,934
Speaker 1: This is the precursor to Star Wars.

989
00:56:48,954 --> 00:56:49,860
Speaker 0: You can put the song there.

990
00:56:50,362 --> 00:56:51,667
Speaker 1: If you put the song there wouldn't worked.

991
00:56:51,988 --> 00:56:55,020
Speaker 0: I'd say it worked and you didn't even have no Imperial March going on.

992
00:56:55,100 --> 00:56:57,931
Speaker 0: It's like come on you had no so and you had a dark sound.

993
00:56:58,152 --> 00:56:59,899
Speaker 0: Liz remember think back to what I'm gonna do in.

994
00:56:59,919 --> 00:57:00,824
Speaker 0: James Oh Jones is dead.

995
00:57:00,924 --> 00:57:01,808
Speaker 0: He's old man.

996
00:57:01,849 --> 00:57:02,210
Speaker 0: He's old.

997
00:57:02,271 --> 00:57:05,781
Speaker 1: think back to episode four or don't die Five.

998
00:57:06,062 --> 00:57:08,510
Speaker 1: there's this note like a musical note.

999
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:11,500
Speaker 1: not a. not a note like a see but like a note like a court.

1000
00:57:11,520 --> 00:57:22,708
Speaker 1: There's this musical Accent that happens whenever we cut to a scene where Imperial bullshit is happening And they use that in Rogue One.

1001
00:57:23,029 --> 00:57:26,780
Speaker 1: They took the notes from the later Star Wars, but not the theme.

1002
00:57:29,361 --> 00:57:30,708
Speaker 0: I'd rather just play the Imperial March.

1003
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:40,066
Speaker 1: So I think that I think this movie did really well is If I think about the things that young rim cared about in Star Wars like the things that I would obsess over and want to see more of

1004
00:57:40,147 --> 00:57:41,849
Speaker 0: lightsabers X-wing

1005
00:57:42,253 --> 00:57:42,859
Speaker 1: x-wings

1006
00:57:43,141 --> 00:57:43,683
Speaker 0: Emperor

1007
00:57:44,024 --> 00:57:46,615
Speaker 1: like there's this big shield and I'm just like, oh, how's that work?

1008
00:57:46,635 --> 00:57:47,700
Speaker 1: What's going on with that shield?

1009
00:57:47,921 --> 00:57:48,767
Speaker 1: So he's gonna crash into.

1010
00:57:48,988 --> 00:57:50,720
Speaker 1: let's have Star Destroyers crash into each other.

1011
00:57:50,840 --> 00:57:52,165
Speaker 0: Lots of pew pew pew.

1012
00:57:52,566 --> 00:57:55,175
Speaker 1: when the Star Destroyer started crashing into the other Star Destroyer.

1013
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:58,912
Speaker 1: I imagine young rim That's the kind of scene young rim would flip the fuck.

1014
00:57:59,032 --> 00:58:00,520
Speaker 0: once you get to that part of the movie.

1015
00:58:00,680 --> 00:58:05,316
Speaker 0: This definitely delivers on the pew pew pew more than any other Star Wars movie.

1016
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:07,962
Speaker 1: and they did it right cuz they introduced What.

1017
00:58:07,982 --> 00:58:09,119
Speaker 1: do you have any of it?

1018
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,138
Speaker 1: Is there a hammerhead?

1019
00:58:10,921 --> 00:58:17,852
Speaker 0: The one part of the movie where I was mad legit excited because there was so much pew pew pew Such high quality pew pew pew.

1020
00:58:18,375 --> 00:58:25,840
Speaker 0: I was just like, oh, baby Yeah, the red everything with everything was bad and everything was accurate to the nerdiness that I already knew.

1021
00:58:26,321 --> 00:58:31,639
Speaker 0: Yep, it was just feeding my fanboy for pew pew and I was like eating it all up like oh, I'm giving more.

1022
00:58:31,679 --> 00:58:32,685
Speaker 0: that like.

1023
00:58:32,785 --> 00:58:48,065
Speaker 1: I think if rogue one had come out like When I was a kid and stuck if rogue one had come out the year that episode one came out instead I feel like Star Wars fervor in the world would be like ten times what is like Star Wars The biggest thing

1024

1036
00:59:15,658 --> 00:59:22,033
Speaker 0: I'll tell you so overall You if you're a nerd see this movie that Star Wars.

1037
00:59:22,194 --> 00:59:25,486

Speaker 1: Well, so one.

1040
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:35,568
Speaker 1: it was a really emotional and I think was good the fact that you know The death happened.

1041
00:59:35,629 --> 00:59:36,720
Speaker 0: I didn't care about them dying.

1042
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:41,592
Speaker 1: Normal movies end on that scene and this one.

1043
00:59:41,692 --> 00:59:50,220
Speaker 1: the music just kept playing and you got that long Montage of the chain of custody of those plans, but I saw the movie after Carrie Fisher died.

1044
00:59:51,241 --> 00:59:52,285
Speaker 0: So I did not.

1045
00:59:52,405 --> 00:59:54,713
Speaker 1: I was a hammer blow that I did not expect.

1046
00:59:55,014 --> 00:59:56,118
Speaker 0: I expected it.

1047
00:59:56,158 --> 00:59:59,348
Speaker 1: But yeah Part of me said yeah, I don't see it.

1048
00:59:59,428 --> 01:00:09,127
Speaker 1: after that part of me said like it ends with Leia getting the plans But then actually seeing Leia on screen saying hope Right after she had died suddenly.

1049
01:00:09,147 --> 01:00:10,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, you saw.

1050
01:00:10,893 --> 01:00:12,177
Speaker 0: I thought you said you see it right away.

1051
01:00:12,237 --> 01:00:13,020
Speaker 0: I saw before you.

1052
01:00:13,461 --> 01:00:15,951
Speaker 1: Yeah, I waited cuz I was busy not a town and stuff.

1053
01:00:16,011 --> 01:00:18,280
Speaker 1: But I saw it reasonably right away.

1054
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:29,006
Speaker 1: I saw it over the whole New Year's holiday area but the whole audience when she appeared on a screen like you heard everyone just like Like everybody got choked up.

1055
01:00:29,226 --> 01:00:31,254
Speaker 0: I mean, it's easy to write that but it works.

1056
01:00:31,655 --> 01:00:32,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why you do it, right?

1057
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:33,583
Speaker 0: It's like any.

01:00:33,623 --> 01:00:34,547
Speaker 0: that's how writers do.

1059
01:00:34,567 --> 01:00:36,736
Speaker 0: if I was a writer I do that same cheap shit.

1060

Speaker 0: cuz it's good.

1061
01:00:39,125 --> 01:00:40,039
Speaker 0: Why wouldn't you do that?

1062
01:00:40,781 --> 01:00:44,200
Speaker 0: It's not hard to come up with it's easy to see through but it don't matter.

1063
01:00:44,421 --> 01:00:46,751
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that's why the same kind of things I'm saying.
