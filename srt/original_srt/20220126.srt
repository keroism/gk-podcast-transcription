1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,299
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, January 26th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:10,520
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,556 --> 00:00:14,090
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,570 --> 00:00:15,715
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,755 --> 00:00:19,250
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about anime with music.

6
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,129
Speaker 1: Music from anime, OSTs, etc.

7
00:00:24,752 --> 00:00:25,748
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:28,471
Speaker 0: So,

9
00:00:28,591 --> 00:00:44,765
Speaker 1: uh, there's something- there's been an attribute of this apartment that I never really thought to, like, say anything about or comment on, but today it was particularly strong to the point that now I wonder if this is a thing in other places in, like, New York City or in other apartment buildings or if it's just us.

10
00:00:45,769 --> 00:00:57,445
Speaker 1: So, the water that comes out of our tap, if it- if we set it to cold, like, no hot water, just the raw, cold water, is so cold it is painful to wash your hands with.

11
00:00:57,525 --> 00:01:01,128
Speaker 0: It is so cold that it is- Oh, now, yeah, this part of the year it is, yeah.

12
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:13,870
Speaker 1: But it's like that for most, basically, from the beginning of winter until the end of spring, it's that way in this building, and then in the summer it is cold but not painfully cold.

13
00:01:14,752 --> 00:01:15,130
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, yeah.

14
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:19,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'm curious what the water temperature is in different buildings, like, straight out of the tap.

15
00:01:20,611 --> 00:01:23,529
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's the same temperature because it's not- it doesn't have to do with your building.

16
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:26,250
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess you could have a situation in your building.

17
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,530
Speaker 1: No, because I've been in other apartments, like, even in Beacon where the water coming out of the tap was not significantly colder in the winter.

18
00:01:34,151 --> 00:01:34,212
Speaker 1: Yup.

19
00:01:34,293 --> 00:01:40,213
Speaker 0: Well, especially because I know where the- The water is cold from the reservoir, it's fucking freezing up in the Catskills, right?

20
00:01:40,434 --> 00:01:44,352
Speaker 0: It goes through an underground aqueduct where it doesn't get any fucking warmer, right?

21
00:01:44,553 --> 00:01:46,401
Speaker 0: And then it goes in pipes underground.

22
00:01:46,482 --> 00:02:01,670
Speaker 0: The only way that you're going to get, you know, warmer, cold water this time of year in New York City is if your building, for some reason, has the pipes arranged in such a way that they go near something warm or something.

23
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,745
Speaker 1: Well, that's what I was getting at because- There's so much water, though, that, like- Or depending on if the building has its own water tower.

24
00:02:06,765 --> 00:02:09,389
Speaker 1: A lot of buildings have, like, a mini water tower, even if it's not on the roof.

25
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:14,530
Speaker 0: Well, if you have a water tower, it's going to be cold again because it's sitting in the- on the roof in the freezing bucket, right?

26
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,280
Speaker 1: There are internal water towers.

27
00:02:17,045 --> 00:02:17,930
Speaker 1: They're actually more common nowadays.

28
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:25,854
Speaker 0: If you have an internal water tower that has- but the amount of- even if you- if you have a water tower that's already moving, right?

29
00:02:26,497 --> 00:02:39,863
Speaker 0: Your- the amount of energy it would take to warm the water even accidentally is so much because, you know, that amount of water moving or that's already that fucking cold, it's like it's not heating up unless you try, right?

30
00:02:40,566 --> 00:02:50,190
Speaker 0: So you need the energy of the sun in the summer to make the cold water from the Catskills up in the mountain reservoir warm at any kind of scale.

31
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:55,558
Speaker 1: Yep, but buildings definitely have a big impact on that because I do remember when I worked at I worked in midtown for a while.

32
00:02:55,798 --> 00:02:58,690
Speaker 1: I still work midtown now, technically, I guess, a few years ago.

33
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:06,630
Speaker 1: It's not like I'm going to the office right now, but the cold water coming out of those taps is consistently about the same temperature no matter what time of year it is.

34
00:03:08,192 --> 00:03:10,042
Speaker 1: But I wonder if it's something about the office building.

35
00:03:10,304 --> 00:03:11,450
Speaker 1: There's a lot of pipes.

36
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:18,852
Speaker 0: Something about the building because, I guarantee, if you go to the, you know, if you go to, like, the street and you go to one of those, like, water testing things- Oh yeah,

37
00:03:18,892 --> 00:03:24,830
Speaker 1: those things are, like, the water that comes out of those drinking fountains, like, along the east side, that is ice, ice cold.

38
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,106
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's going to be, in this time of year, it's going to be ice cold.

39
00:03:28,146 --> 00:03:31,366
Speaker 0: So that's, you know, that's, it's not a problem.

40
00:03:31,386 --> 00:03:31,949
Speaker 0: That's a feature.

41
00:03:32,611 --> 00:03:33,697
Speaker 1: Oh, the colder the better.

42
00:03:33,737 --> 00:03:40,030
Speaker 1: I want my hot tap to be dangerously hot and my cold tap to be painfully cold, like, just on the edge of freezing.

43
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:48,189
Speaker 0: That is a, that is one of the features that makes New York City tap water so great, is that the most of the year the cold water is really cold.

44
00:03:48,531 --> 00:04:00,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I, but I guess I'm betting in those old buildings in Midtown, a lot of water is hanging out inside the building because the taps don't get used as often in an office building compared to, like, an apartment building.

45
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:06,268
Speaker 0: That is another way that the water could warm up, is if simply, like- It's in the pipe just sitting there in the building for four hours.

46
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:12,855
Speaker 0: If you're in, if you, first thing in the morning, if you wake up before any of your neighbors you turn on the cold tap-

47
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:25,110
Speaker 1: because in the morning, whenever I take a shower, it is ice cold for, like, four minutes of running the water until hot water finally appears.

48
00:04:25,991 --> 00:04:27,157
Speaker 0: Oh, until the hot water comes through.

49
00:04:27,177 --> 00:04:35,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the same will be true on the cold side, is that it'll be kind of lukewarm for, like, a little bit, and then the cold water from the supply will come in.

50
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,009
Speaker 1: So yeah, thanks to COVID, that's the most exciting thing I had to talk about in the last week.

51
00:04:43,414 --> 00:04:45,506
Speaker 1: I had a moment, I was like, "Damn, the water's cold today.

52
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:45,848
Speaker 1: Ow!".

53
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:59,084
Speaker 0: I mean, I went, I went outside for the second time this year, you know, Dennis was the first time, I went to a hockey game no one else would go to, it was fine, I couldn't convince- even with an Instagram post, I could not convince anyone I knew.

54
00:04:59,104 --> 00:05:06,484
Speaker 1: Oh, so, I think I- BlueShirtsNation, like, the fan account tweeted while you were at the game, near the end of the first period, "Hey, are you in New York?

55
00:05:06,665 --> 00:05:07,650
Speaker 1: Wanna go to this game?

56
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:08,818
Speaker 1: Free ticket, text

57
00:05:08,859 --> 00:05:09,000
Speaker 1: me.".

58
00:05:09,808 --> 00:05:10,030
Speaker 0: Right.

59
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:21,481
Speaker 0: I could not get- so, the person I eventually got to go with was, I went to the Rangers subreddit, and I got some kid from Jersey, right, some 20-something-year-old kid from Jersey.

60
00:05:21,501 --> 00:05:23,996
Speaker 1: I mean, that subreddit's not the worst, like, I've seen worse.

61
00:05:24,218 --> 00:05:27,516
Speaker 0: No, and he was not, you know, was he a person that I would hang out with?

62
00:05:27,737 --> 00:05:29,303
Speaker 0: No, but was he a bad person?

63
00:05:29,323 --> 00:05:32,295
Speaker 0: Also, no, just to- While she's listening, like,

64
00:05:32,435 --> 00:05:34,243
Speaker 0: "Ah!"

65
00:05:34,283 --> 00:05:35,890
Speaker 0: He was an okay person, right?

66
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know a lot of okay people.

67
00:05:39,161 --> 00:05:42,537
Speaker 1: Like, in some of our worlds, I would have rated her a solid four out of ten.

68
00:05:43,201 --> 00:05:53,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I think, you know, what I realized, though, is that if, you know, if you think about it, you're going to a- if you go to a public sporting event, especially a big professional sporting

69
00:05:53,609 --> 00:05:56,230
Speaker 1: event- Oh, yeah, you have no idea who's gonna sit next to you in normal time.

70
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,233
Speaker 0: You have no idea.

71
00:05:57,293 --> 00:06:06,410
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, and it's like, unless you buy a whole luxury box or some shit, right, it's like, you are- someone in your group is sitting next to a total stranger.

72
00:06:06,811 --> 00:06:09,803
Speaker 1: Well, there are places where that doesn't happen.

73
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:15,370
Speaker 0: If you have an expensive season ticket in certain parts- I said if you have a luxury box or something, yeah.

74
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:27,280
Speaker 1: If you are part of a non-super professional, like, college or something else where there's a cheering section that is regulars who always sit in the same place all the time- I already discounted your scenarios.

75
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, those are the only two possible scenarios.

76
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:36,910
Speaker 0: But the point is, you're already- you're sitting next to a stranger anyway, so what does it matter if you give one of your tickets to a stranger?

77
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,303
Speaker 0: It's like, it's not a dangerous situation.

78
00:06:40,323 --> 00:06:41,127
Speaker 0: Well, no, it's not even that.

79
00:06:41,207 --> 00:06:42,331
Speaker 1: It's not even your seat.

80
00:06:42,372 --> 00:06:45,224
Speaker 1: It's just that seat is like what a seat would normally be.

81
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,701
Speaker 1: It's what every seat except the one you had a ticket for is normally going to have.

82
00:06:49,465 --> 00:06:59,256
Speaker 0: Right, and it's like, as long as you contacted this person and gave them the ticket via some system that doesn't de-anonymize you so they know your address or some shit, right?

83
00:06:59,698 --> 00:07:03,250
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, he knows my Venmo because he gave me money.

84
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,716
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, that's it.

85
00:07:04,956 --> 00:07:05,940
Speaker 0: You can't find my house.

86
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,530
Speaker 0: It's like, there's no danger whatsoever.

87
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:19,736
Speaker 0: So it's actually, I think, a very good way if you want to meet people is to invite them to public sporting events.

88
00:07:20,399 --> 00:07:23,734
Speaker 0: Even if you don't give a shit about the sporting event, you get the cheapest seat, whatever.

89
00:07:24,196 --> 00:07:26,806
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, a total stranger that I want to meet?

90
00:07:26,966 --> 00:07:36,319
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, it's probably safer to meet you at the top of Citi Field in the cheap seats than it is to meet you at like a cafe or something, you know?

91
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:40,274
Speaker 1: Yep, you have a lot more escape avenues if that guy has in fact appeared.

92
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:41,398
Speaker 0: And there's security.

93
00:07:41,418 --> 00:07:42,783
Speaker 0: there is the point, right?

94
00:07:43,787 --> 00:07:45,093
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's security that doesn't fuck around.

95
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:46,904
Speaker 0: What's he going to do, get thrown out of the stadium?

96
00:07:47,045 --> 00:07:51,147
Speaker 1: Every time I've seen security react to something in a major, like in a professional sport area.

97
00:07:51,167 --> 00:07:54,825
Speaker 0: Especially Madison Square Garden, which will be worse than, I guess, the other stadiums.

98
00:07:54,845 --> 00:08:00,108
Speaker 1: Usually the security people have appeared and dealt with something before I was aware there was something to deal with.

99
00:08:00,971 --> 00:08:03,521
Speaker 0: Yeah, Madison Square Garden, it's much, much tighter.

100
00:08:04,445 --> 00:08:07,836
Speaker 1: Like you hear someone go, whoa, and you look and there's already four security people.

101
00:08:08,619 --> 00:08:08,759
Speaker 0: Yep.

102
00:08:09,581 --> 00:08:19,050
Speaker 0: So yeah, if anyone is listening to this and you want to go to Madison Square Garden this year to see ice hockey, you should contact me.

103
00:08:19,171 --> 00:08:21,679
Speaker 1: I feel like the time is coming soon or I'll start going again.

104
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:22,923
Speaker 0: Come on Friday.

105
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,015
Speaker 1: I'm really, really thinking about it.

106
00:08:26,035 --> 00:08:27,421
Speaker 1: The numbers are just going down.

107
00:08:28,365 --> 00:08:29,490
Speaker 1: Emily's giving me the thumbs up.

108
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,373
Speaker 1: She's like, come on.

109
00:08:31,880 --> 00:08:32,623
Speaker 1: Emily was waffling.

110
00:08:32,643 --> 00:08:34,773
Speaker 1: Well, I was waffling too on going to that other game that you went to.

111
00:08:34,793 --> 00:08:36,220
Speaker 0: All right, Emily, Emily, come with me.

112
00:08:36,381 --> 00:08:39,975
Speaker 1: Also, at least that game you went to, that was a fucking game.

113
00:08:40,818 --> 00:08:41,078
Speaker 0: Yeah.

114
00:08:41,118 --> 00:08:45,853
Speaker 0: I mean, well, that was a team that was very close in skill level to our team, right?

115
00:08:45,893 --> 00:08:57,935
Speaker 0: It's like, we're not, we're not the elite level of like, you know, Carolina and uh, uh, like a Colorado, but it was, it was captured by, we're on that second level of like the very good teams.

116
00:08:58,035 --> 00:08:58,978
Speaker 0: And so is LA.

117
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:04,675
Speaker 0: They beat the shit out of us in LA, but you know, we, uh, it was keeping it close.

118
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:05,900
Speaker 1: All right.

119
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,984
Speaker 1: So anyway, I guess we'll get to some news.

120
00:09:07,045 --> 00:09:11,262
Speaker 1: I got a little news, uh, can talk about a show that I doubt any of you have ever even heard of.

121
00:09:11,282 --> 00:09:15,820
Speaker 1: I think I geeked by it at once because this show is from like 2008, 2007.

122
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,430
Speaker 0: I didn't finish watching it, but I did watch.

123
00:09:18,771 --> 00:09:24,350
Speaker 0: I watched quite a handful of episodes when it, when I think that was a show that was so old.

124
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:27,443
Speaker 0: I was like downloading fan subs digitally on BitTorrent.

125
00:09:27,623 --> 00:09:27,865
Speaker 1: Yup.

126
00:09:28,005 --> 00:09:32,103
Speaker 0: I, in fact, I found on my, I probably still have those files on my NAS somewhere.

127
00:09:32,223 --> 00:09:36,743
Speaker 1: The reason I stopped watching it is I didn't have a complete run of it and it was a pain to pirate.

128
00:09:36,844 --> 00:09:38,270
Speaker 0: I also don't have a complete run.

129
00:09:38,830 --> 00:09:40,256
Speaker 1: So, uh, Denno coil.

130
00:09:40,276 --> 00:09:41,943
Speaker 0: I do have a complete run.

131
00:09:41,963 --> 00:09:43,028
Speaker 0: Let me check while we're talking.

132
00:09:43,068 --> 00:09:45,176
Speaker 1: Denno coil is now just on Netflix.

133
00:09:45,216 --> 00:09:45,978
Speaker 1: You can just watch it.

134
00:09:46,179 --> 00:09:47,303
Speaker 0: Oh, it's already on there.

135
00:09:47,323 --> 00:09:47,383
Speaker 0: Yup.

136
00:09:47,765 --> 00:09:48,969
Speaker 0: Oh no.

137
00:09:50,293 --> 00:09:53,525
Speaker 1: So I'm a little premature and it will be on there at midnight tonight.

138
00:09:54,488 --> 00:09:54,829
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

139
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:57,662
Speaker 0: I was, I thought it was that the news was like, it's coming soon.

140
00:09:57,783 --> 00:09:57,923
Speaker 0: Yeah.

141
00:09:57,943 --> 00:09:59,892
Speaker 1: Coming soon is midnight tonight.

142
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:00,755
Speaker 0: All right.

143
00:10:00,776 --> 00:10:03,165
Speaker 0: Well, I guess we have finally have a Wednesday show.

144
00:10:03,205 --> 00:10:03,526
Speaker 0: Yeah.

145
00:10:03,787 --> 00:10:14,077
Speaker 1: So, uh, ball says, cause I haven't one, I only saw like six episodes of this show and two, I saw them in like 2008, 2009.

146
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:20,113
Speaker 1: Like we were still in beacon, but Denno coil was super good from what I saw and much.

147
00:10:20,153 --> 00:10:21,960
Speaker 0: I remember it being good at the time.

148
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:33,742
Speaker 1: And it's a, it's honestly, it's a serious sci-fi in that much like how ghost in the shell wall, the literal events happening in ghost in the shell are not like what is actually happening in cyberspace today.

149
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:39,002
Speaker 1: The topics that it addressed were eerily similar to how they were playing out today.

150
00:10:39,122 --> 00:10:40,447
Speaker 1: Like it was pretty good.

151
00:10:40,528 --> 00:10:41,010
Speaker 1: Sci-fi.

152
00:10:41,431 --> 00:10:46,365
Speaker 0: Denno coil is also, oh no, I have fan subs of all 26 episodes in seven 20 P.

153
00:10:46,686 --> 00:10:54,690
Speaker 1: Denno coil is basically exploring what kids today are entering into in terms of what the internet is like to them.

154
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:58,680
Speaker 0: Well today, meaning 2000 something 22.

155
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,606
Speaker 1: Yeah.

156
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:15,721
Speaker 1: Like when it came out, not now, so an anime from 2007 scarily accurately depicted a 15 year old anime, how young children will interact with the kind of internet that exists.

157
00:11:16,283 --> 00:11:22,043
Speaker 1: And it was at least from what I saw up to the point, I stopped extremely prescient and very interesting.

158
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:22,866
Speaker 0: Yeah.

159
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:25,517
Speaker 0: I do have fan subs of the whole fucking 26 episodes.

160
00:11:25,678 --> 00:11:28,070
Speaker 0: If that's how many episodes there are, which I assume is correct.

161
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:31,628
Speaker 0: So I'm going to give these are seven 20 P. I bet the Netflix is probably better.

162
00:11:31,728 --> 00:11:34,061
Speaker 1: So yeah, I'm going to give this a watch cause.

163
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:38,781
Speaker 1: uh, I really wanted to finish this show and I just didn't cause it was kind of annoying to find it.

164
00:11:39,523 --> 00:11:40,647
Speaker 0: Well, I got it somehow.

165
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:42,093
Speaker 0: So I guess that wasn't the problem.

166
00:11:43,177 --> 00:11:48,158
Speaker 1: I all my files in this directory, clearly they're like from different fan subbers and different downloads.

167
00:11:48,178 --> 00:11:49,203
Speaker 0: Mine are all from the same.

168
00:11:49,263 --> 00:11:54,382
Speaker 0: I must've downloaded a torrent of every episode cause they're all the same, every name and everything.

169
00:11:55,406 --> 00:11:57,712
Speaker 1: Um, so yeah, you got something I do.

170
00:11:57,732 --> 00:11:59,441
Speaker 0: I don't have any news, but I got a geek bite.

171
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:05,640
Speaker 0: I read this manga that came out in English called Sigma Tara by, I hope I pronounced the name correctly.

172
00:12:05,761 --> 00:12:07,585
Speaker 0: Minoru Minoru Furuya.

173
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:20,589
Speaker 0: Um, so Minoru Furuya is like a, I don't know a lot about this person, but it's, it's like when I saw the name on the comic order form, I'm like, that's the name of a famous mangaka that I know.

174
00:12:20,629 --> 00:12:26,659
Speaker 0: it's the name of a famous mangaka, but I don't know what the hell they've done or who they are, but I know that name from somewhere.

175
00:12:26,719 --> 00:12:31,157
Speaker 0: And I looked it up and they did, you know, the old ping pong club.

176
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:33,166
Speaker 0: That's how they got famous originally.

177
00:12:33,227 --> 00:12:40,316
Speaker 0: So I was like, aha, at least I know something about you now, even though there's not that much information in English about your works and whatnot.

178
00:12:40,757 --> 00:12:48,902
Speaker 0: But I think that I believe this is the first time any of Minoru's work has been published legally in English.

179
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:51,650
Speaker 0: Uh, so I think that's correct.

180
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:55,665
Speaker 0: So, uh, volume one came out from who the hell published it?

181
00:12:55,705 --> 00:12:56,227
Speaker 0: Kodansha.

182
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:57,592
Speaker 0: Look how thick this fricking thing is.

183
00:12:57,893 --> 00:12:59,258
Speaker 1: Oh, you got it.

184
00:12:59,358 --> 00:13:00,662
Speaker 0: It's a big, it's a big one.

185
00:13:00,883 --> 00:13:01,204
Speaker 0: Yeah.

186
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:03,412
Speaker 0: Uh, so I got around to reading it.

187
00:13:04,455 --> 00:13:18,136
Speaker 0: And first of all, what I got to say is that Siguatera, if you don't know, is the name of a certain kind of poisoning you get from eating fish that has some kind of toxins in it from the water, the fish lived in.

188
00:13:18,818 --> 00:13:23,471
Speaker 0: So I didn't know that until I Googled the name of the manga.

189
00:13:25,475 --> 00:13:30,065
Speaker 0: Um, and what it's about is, you know, it's, it's a realistic story.

190
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:35,639
Speaker 0: Uh, and it's about, you know, teenage angst and drama, right?

191
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:41,558
Speaker 0: As a teenage kid in school, he's got a friend, they're nerds, they're nerds about motorcycles.

192
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:44,308
Speaker 0: There's a bully who bullies him, right?

193
00:13:44,729 --> 00:13:50,005
Speaker 0: Uh, but he goes after school secretly to take motorcycle license class, right?

194
00:13:50,406 --> 00:13:53,819
Speaker 0: He sees a hot girl there, but he doesn't know her or talk to her.

195
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:54,843
Speaker 0: All right.

196
00:13:55,064 --> 00:13:58,295
Speaker 0: You think it's all pretty typical, just one of those, right?

197
00:13:59,037 --> 00:14:09,904
Speaker 0: Um, but it then after that very typical sort of high school set up, it's sort of a twist everything around, right?

198
00:14:09,924 --> 00:14:11,749
Speaker 0: In a different direction, right?

199
00:14:12,109 --> 00:14:13,594
Speaker 0: Someone that was bad is good.

200
00:14:13,674 --> 00:14:20,894
Speaker 0: Someone that was good is bad actually talks to and dates the girl in a normal kind of way, right?

201
00:14:21,615 --> 00:14:36,087
Speaker 0: Uh, it's very, um, realistic, I guess in terms of that, like I couldn't present me, could not identify with anything going on here, but teenage me could, right?

202
00:14:36,588 --> 00:14:42,502
Speaker 0: This character has the same sort of, you know, teenage feelings that I had when I was 13, 14, right?

203
00:14:42,522 --> 00:14:50,229
Speaker 1: I watched Scott Pilgrim again recently and yeah, there's, there's that kind of situation for sure, right?

204
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:58,752
Speaker 0: Now, you know, I think where it's going, uh, because there's more volumes, this isn't the whole thing.

205
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:09,744
Speaker 0: I think that there's going to be literal Siguatera because one of the bad characters, uh, be friends, some kind of fishermen and it's up to something.

206
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:20,258
Speaker 0: Uh, so I think someone is going to get poisoned with Siguatera, I think is the reason for the title of the, the comic and like the biohazard symbol appears.

207
00:15:20,278 --> 00:15:21,563
Speaker 0: It's very tiny on the cover.

208
00:15:21,623 --> 00:15:29,430
Speaker 0: It's dotting the I in Siguatera, but it appears in the book in various places as sort of Chekhov's biohazard symbol.

209
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:34,363
Speaker 1: It could be a spoiler to know that Siguatera is basically never fatal.

210
00:15:35,988 --> 00:15:40,282
Speaker 1: That's good to know, but there is no known treatment antidote or cure.

211
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:41,928
Speaker 0: That's bad.

212
00:15:42,168 --> 00:15:42,409
Speaker 1: Yeah.

213
00:15:43,971 --> 00:15:45,617
Speaker 0: It primarily about Siguatera.

214
00:15:45,637 --> 00:15:49,350
Speaker 0: I didn't even know it was a thing until I primarily causes diarrhea.

215
00:15:50,411 --> 00:15:50,973
Speaker 0: That sucks.

216
00:15:51,174 --> 00:15:51,475
Speaker 1: Yeah.

217
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:57,303
Speaker 1: Uh, and there's a whole Wikipedia article that I haven't, uh, read because I'm literally, you didn't know about it before right now.

218
00:15:57,343 --> 00:15:57,544
Speaker 0: Did you?

219
00:15:57,645 --> 00:15:58,912
Speaker 1: I'd heard of it, but I didn't.

220
00:15:59,273 --> 00:16:03,350
Speaker 1: It's like, like it's one of those words for like, isn't that some kind of illness?

221
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:09,491
Speaker 0: I don't really, I ordered, I ordered this manga based on the author being a name that I had heard of.

222
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:13,681
Speaker 0: Um, and should I recommend you read it?

223
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:15,486
Speaker 0: Well, it's a well-crafted manga.

224
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:31,699
Speaker 0: Uh, if you want to identify with feelings of a, of a teenage boy who likes motorcycles, um, then yes, if you appreciate that it is such a finely crafted manga, then yes.

225
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:41,842
Speaker 0: Otherwise, man, maybe it's good, but it's not like some legendary work, you know, or anything like that.

226
00:16:42,464 --> 00:16:48,704
Speaker 0: Um, you know, and of course, you know, there's a lot of, uh, uh, you know, horniness, right?

227
00:16:48,884 --> 00:16:49,346
Speaker 0: Not like.

228
00:16:49,627 --> 00:17:00,161
Speaker 0: it's not perverted, you know, or, or graphic or any, you know, moe kind of nonsense, nothing like that, but it's like, yeah, he's a 13 year old kid.

229
00:17:00,522 --> 00:17:02,728
Speaker 0: He's going out with a hot girl, right?

230
00:17:02,888 --> 00:17:05,236
Speaker 0: This is how he legitimately feels, right?

231
00:17:05,317 --> 00:17:09,030
Speaker 0: And we're going to illustrate his true feelings, et cetera, right?

232
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:19,817
Speaker 1: So, but anyway, things of the day.

233
00:17:19,916 --> 00:17:28,663
Speaker 1: So, uh, this is just a really tiny little thing, but, uh, there's a song by Caravan Palace, a band I like called Wonderland that has a fantastic animated music video.

234
00:17:29,145 --> 00:17:31,897
Speaker 1: I'm not just making my thing of the day, an official music video.

235
00:17:31,937 --> 00:17:36,319
Speaker 1: for many years ago, like that's, I feel like that ship sailed in terms of geek nights, things of the day.

236
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:49,595
Speaker 1: So someone took that song and that video and animated a different story to it, but in the same style of the original, uh, animated music video.

237
00:17:50,297 --> 00:17:54,733
Speaker 1: And it's actually really, officially or unofficially, just some, just some fan.

238
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,263
Speaker 0: Did the band get mad or did the band say it was awesome?

239
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:59,494
Speaker 1: Uh, the band probably does not know what exists.

240
00:17:59,695 --> 00:18:02,688
Speaker 1: It looks like it's part of a cluster of, so option three.

241
00:18:02,768 --> 00:18:02,969
Speaker 0: Yeah.

242
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:09,135
Speaker 1: It's basically in this, you know, there's clusters of like AMV people who all follow each other and make stuff and cross promote.

243
00:18:09,456 --> 00:18:24,040
Speaker 1: There's like this cluster of animators who animate videos like this, but this one just, it, it echoed the style of the original video really well, but also told actually a pretty interesting story and it's pretty good.

244
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:25,267
Speaker 1: Like it's two minutes long.

245
00:18:25,327 --> 00:18:27,519
Speaker 1: It's not that much shorter than like magnetic rows.

246
00:18:29,581 --> 00:18:30,724
Speaker 1: It's worth watching little thing.

247
00:18:30,744 --> 00:18:33,372
Speaker 0: All right.

248
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:34,034
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

249
00:18:34,777 --> 00:18:35,078
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

250
00:18:35,178 --> 00:18:49,922
Speaker 0: Way back in the, I forget when I heard this, but I remember there was some videos watching where someone was in like the Beatles studio and they're playing back like the actual original recording from some Beatles song.

251
00:18:50,383 --> 00:18:50,664
Speaker 0: Right.

252
00:18:50,985 --> 00:18:53,354
Speaker 0: And they had the, you know, the giant studio mixing board.

253
00:18:53,374 --> 00:18:58,033
Speaker 0: And so they were, had like the original recording of every single track.

254
00:18:58,114 --> 00:19:00,343
Speaker 0: And they were like, let's just listen to this, you know, right.

255
00:19:00,424 --> 00:19:05,240
Speaker 0: Cause you, you have only ever heard the final mixed and mastered version.

256
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:07,889
Speaker 0: You've never heard the original right parts.

257
00:19:07,989 --> 00:19:08,270
Speaker 0: Right.

258
00:19:08,672 --> 00:19:14,330
Speaker 0: And they, and even though, you know, that, you know, I was watching a video.

259
00:19:14,912 --> 00:19:23,983
Speaker 0: So whatever sound was being heard in that studio was going into the microphone of some camera and then encoded into some press thing and then on YouTube or whatever.

260
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:24,746
Speaker 0: Right.

261
00:19:25,087 --> 00:19:29,743
Speaker 0: It's like, it still sounded like incredible, like not what you heard ever in your life.

262
00:19:30,505 --> 00:19:34,558
Speaker 0: Um, uh, but I always thought it's like, wow, that's amazing.

263
00:19:34,618 --> 00:19:41,324
Speaker 0: I would love to hear that for like every song ever, but clearly that's something you have to like, you don't have access to right.

264
00:19:41,344 --> 00:19:42,971
Speaker 0: That they're not putting those files out there.

265
00:19:43,132 --> 00:19:43,634
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

266
00:19:43,654 --> 00:19:49,260
Speaker 1: Those are those some, you can sometimes license those for extreme amounts of money.

267
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:50,541
Speaker 1: At best.

268
00:19:51,244 --> 00:19:51,464
Speaker 0: Right.

269
00:19:51,525 --> 00:19:57,103
Speaker 0: So, but I stumbled across this, uh, on YouTube, this guy's channel home studio simplified.

270
00:19:57,204 --> 00:19:59,835
Speaker 0: I assume his chat, I didn't look at the other videos he has.

271
00:19:59,855 --> 00:20:11,373
Speaker 0: I assume he's mostly talking about, you know, home recording studio setups, but in this video he somehow got from, and it is the top comment is, uh, I just clicked on that.

272
00:20:11,574 --> 00:20:14,203
Speaker 0: just as you said, where are you getting these multi-tracks?

273
00:20:14,424 --> 00:20:16,852
Speaker 0: answer some awesome people in our Facebook group.

274
00:20:16,872 --> 00:20:27,046
Speaker 0: So someone got the multi-track recording to the staying alive by the Bee Gees, which is, I guess one of the, probably one of the a hundred best songs ever.

275
00:20:27,126 --> 00:20:32,387
Speaker 1: Maybe that is, I feel like that would fit into the top hundred and I would be hard pressed to argue against it.

276
00:20:32,668 --> 00:20:33,532
Speaker 1: I'd have to list.

277
00:20:34,014 --> 00:20:37,147
Speaker 1: I would struggle to list a hundred songs better than that quickly.

278
00:20:37,889 --> 00:20:40,218
Speaker 0: It's an S tier song, regardless of ranking.

279
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:40,619
Speaker 0: Right.

280
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:43,830
Speaker 0: There might be more than a hundred S tier songs regardless.

281
00:20:44,131 --> 00:20:51,274
Speaker 0: So he's got every track from that song from the original studio recording somehow, and he's not taken down from YouTube somehow.

282
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:58,900
Speaker 0: Um, yeah, so this guy, he opens it up and I think like cakewalk or whatever digital audio workstation is using.

283
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:01,669
Speaker 0: It's not one that I have, um, or I've seen before.

284
00:21:02,051 --> 00:21:06,608
Speaker 0: And he, he listens to the whole thing and then he listens to each track individually.

285
00:21:06,688 --> 00:21:10,784
Speaker 0: Some of the tracks are like left, right splits, and then he'll play the two tracks together.

286
00:21:10,804 --> 00:21:11,708
Speaker 0: Right.

287
00:21:12,229 --> 00:21:16,745
Speaker 0: Um, and he's just listening to, you know, piece by piece, like what's going on in this song.

288
00:21:16,886 --> 00:21:20,821
Speaker 0: And it's like, it's like, I've heard the song again for the first time.

289
00:21:21,242 --> 00:21:22,386
Speaker 0: It's, it's unbelievable.

290
00:21:22,426 --> 00:21:27,542
Speaker 0: It's like, I think the old, the best metaphor would be like cookies are delicious.

291
00:21:27,642 --> 00:21:27,903
Speaker 0: Right.

292
00:21:28,565 --> 00:21:33,076
Speaker 0: But when you eat raw cookie dough, right.

293
00:21:33,337 --> 00:21:35,203
Speaker 0: It's like, that's, that's like something else.

294
00:21:35,424 --> 00:21:41,086
Speaker 0: Or when you see like comic artists and it's like, you have the finished comic book colored inked printed everything.

295
00:21:41,147 --> 00:21:41,327
Speaker 0: Right.

296
00:21:41,648 --> 00:21:50,418
Speaker 0: But then when you look at the original pencils for the same exact page, it's like, they're not finished, but there's actually something about them.

297
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,863
Speaker 0: That's like more powerful.

298
00:21:52,265 --> 00:21:57,120
Speaker 0: that somehow like got lost in the, you know, in the rest of the production process.

299
00:21:57,420 --> 00:22:01,821
Speaker 1: So not, not to harp on this, but as an aside, that's kind of what our canes animation feels like.

300
00:22:01,861 --> 00:22:05,699
Speaker 1: It looks like you just took that and made it directly and skip that final step.

301
00:22:06,621 --> 00:22:06,841
Speaker 0: All right.

302
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:11,997
Speaker 0: But anyway, the, I especially want to draw attention to, right.

303
00:22:12,017 --> 00:22:18,577
Speaker 0: So he listens to the, the original, you know, tracks of this song and, you know, mildly comments on them.

304
00:22:19,098 --> 00:22:29,754
Speaker 0: But the part, you know, you should, this is worth all 37 minutes of your time to listen to the whole thing, but especially right at the 17, he's got YouTube chapters.

305
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:33,044
Speaker 0: So you're all good at like the 17 and half minute mark.

306
00:22:33,506 --> 00:22:35,696
Speaker 1: Oh, that is literally what I just listened to.

307
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:36,439
Speaker 1: That's as far as I got.

308
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:41,453
Speaker 0: There's an acoustic guitar track that I've never heard before in my life.

309
00:22:41,714 --> 00:22:48,096
Speaker 0: It must be so either not existent in the final recording or so turned down in the final recording.

310
00:22:48,137 --> 00:22:54,737
Speaker 0: You can't hear it, but it's like, this is a disco song about as dancy and disco as you can get, right.

311
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:59,374
Speaker 0: It's literally from the OST of Saturday night fever, that title song that's.

312
00:22:59,434 --> 00:23:01,060
Speaker 0: it was made for that purpose.

313
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:12,032
Speaker 0: And yet, if you listen to this track, it's clearly the same song, but it sounds like it's some fucking Western track for like a cowboy movie or some shit.

314
00:23:12,594 --> 00:23:12,834
Speaker 0: Right.

315
00:23:13,175 --> 00:23:14,419
Speaker 0: It's just unbelievable.

316
00:23:14,519 --> 00:23:19,200
Speaker 0: And the person playing the guitar, even though they're just playing like this steady rhythm, right.

317
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:23,854
Speaker 0: Their rhythm is like uncannily steady, right.

318
00:23:23,934 --> 00:23:26,121
Speaker 0: It's like, what the hell, who the hell is playing that guitar?

319
00:23:27,304 --> 00:23:34,984
Speaker 0: Also of note, there are some of the strings tracks or like some of the synth string tracks, right.

320
00:23:35,385 --> 00:23:48,980
Speaker 0: They sound like they're from, you know, like, like the, like from old movies, like they don't sound like they're, it's like when you hear them in the song at, you know, as a whole, they make sense, you know, cause disco songs commonly have, you know, strings going on.

321
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:49,481
Speaker 0: Right.

322
00:23:50,665 --> 00:23:56,242
Speaker 0: But on their own, they sound like, you know, dramatic notes from some melodrama or something.

323
00:23:56,262 --> 00:24:02,265
Speaker 1: Well, that could, that could either be cause it was sampled or it could be because they just like, I don't think it was an accent.

324
00:24:02,947 --> 00:24:03,128
Speaker 0: Right.

325
00:24:03,469 --> 00:24:26,627
Speaker 0: But the, uh, there's also like when you listen to them on their own, there are like these subtleties to the, to the strings that don't come across because there's too much harmonization in the final track, uh, at that are really quite unbelievable, but it's just like, uh, yeah, this is really something, uh, I bet this guy probably other has videos of other raw tracks.

326
00:24:26,788 --> 00:24:28,432
Speaker 1: It feels like this is one of his things.

327
00:24:29,255 --> 00:24:29,656
Speaker 0: Yeah.

328
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:32,948
Speaker 0: So raw track reaction, I'm getting into it.

329
00:24:33,410 --> 00:24:35,840
Speaker 0: And, uh, I don't know how it could get better than this.

330
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,345
Speaker 0: What else does he get a raw track?

331
00:24:37,365 --> 00:24:37,706
Speaker 0: Right.

332
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:39,111
Speaker 0: Yeah.

333
00:24:39,532 --> 00:24:44,430
Speaker 1: Cause it won't be nearly as exciting for a small band or like a lot of pop in that.

334
00:24:44,510 --> 00:24:45,654
Speaker 0: I got to see if he's got a queen.

335
00:24:45,755 --> 00:24:47,039
Speaker 0: Any queen song is going to be.

336
00:24:48,023 --> 00:24:48,244
Speaker 0: I am.

337
00:24:48,626 --> 00:24:49,670
Speaker 1: I'm going to Google right now.

338
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:53,184
Speaker 1: I am, before we get it, I am confident there are queen multi-tracks out there.

339
00:24:53,887 --> 00:24:54,408
Speaker 0: Probably.

340
00:24:54,428 --> 00:24:56,475
Speaker 1: Uh, now I have to go tracks.

341
00:24:56,937 --> 00:24:57,820
Speaker 0: There goes my evening.

342
00:25:00,782 --> 00:25:08,873
Speaker 1: So anyway, in the meta moment, the geek nice book club book, which Scott has finished, uh, and I have, I've reached Genji's demise and beyond.

343
00:25:09,234 --> 00:25:10,719
Speaker 1: We will be doing a show on this.

344
00:25:10,739 --> 00:25:12,767
Speaker 0: You got, you got, you got seven days.

345
00:25:12,787 --> 00:25:15,799
Speaker 1: Hey, one of those chapters was in fact very quick to read.

346
00:25:16,701 --> 00:25:18,405
Speaker 0: It's super quick.

347
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:23,299
Speaker 0: I read the remainder of that book, I think in less than a week.

348
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:24,924
Speaker 1: It was a fast read when I was motivated.

349
00:25:25,466 --> 00:25:27,935
Speaker 1: Also, it gets easier to read as it goes on.

350
00:25:28,016 --> 00:25:30,745
Speaker 0: It's not just after the very, after the very short chapter.

351
00:25:30,825 --> 00:25:37,788
Speaker 0: reading is much easier because less happens and the words are more, uh, easier at least the English words.

352
00:25:37,848 --> 00:25:38,109
Speaker 1: Yep.

353
00:25:38,652 --> 00:25:40,720
Speaker 1: Otherwise we got no cons coming up for a while.

354
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,208
Speaker 1: We're working on a bunch of stuff, working on the new website.

355
00:25:44,513 --> 00:25:45,095
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

356
00:25:45,536 --> 00:25:46,822
Speaker 1: Uh, we do live stream the show.

357
00:25:46,902 --> 00:25:50,483
Speaker 1: If you didn't know that on my YouTube channel at geek nights rim, we've been doing this for a long time.

358
00:25:50,804 --> 00:25:58,596
Speaker 1: I say it because you could have seen if you're watching a live stream that I was reading the Wikipedia article on the Sigma Terra disease as we were doing the show.

359
00:25:58,877 --> 00:26:00,485
Speaker 1: That's how we sound like we know stuff.

360
00:26:00,666 --> 00:26:03,299
Speaker 1: We both just have Wikipedia and YouTube in front of us all the time.

361
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:05,644
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

362
00:26:05,764 --> 00:26:07,533
Speaker 1: Otherwise I guess we just get right into the main bit.

363
00:26:07,634 --> 00:26:08,518
Speaker 1: I got nothing else right now.

364
00:26:09,382 --> 00:26:10,806
Speaker 0: I got, I know it's the slow time.

365
00:26:10,927 --> 00:26:13,314
Speaker 1: So, uh, anime music.

366
00:26:13,575 --> 00:26:19,394
Speaker 1: Now I realized we hadn't done a show on this and we both haven't read or watched the same things in a little while.

367
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:20,940
Speaker 1: We'll rectify that soon.

368
00:26:21,382 --> 00:26:31,459
Speaker 1: So we were looking for a topic and I realized the only shows we've ever done about anime music were around openings and endings, not like the soundtracks or scores to anime directly.

369
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:32,962
Speaker 0: Hmm.

370
00:26:33,865 --> 00:26:40,407
Speaker 1: And, uh, I did just watch a little bit of Initial D recently for unrelated reasons, which stirred a fire in my soul.

371
00:26:40,789 --> 00:26:42,596
Speaker 1: So it seemed like a decent topic.

372
00:26:42,616 --> 00:26:44,482
Speaker 1: I feel like we might have a lot to say about this.

373
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:53,246
Speaker 1: Uh, I spent much of my adult life listening heavily to just anime OSTs specifically, especially high school.

374
00:26:54,470 --> 00:27:00,493
Speaker 0: Well, I do think that is one thing that OSTs for, you're talking about animated television, not movies.

375
00:27:00,654 --> 00:27:02,321
Speaker 1: I guess we'll have to clarify a little bit.

376
00:27:02,341 --> 00:27:07,383
Speaker 1: We'll constrain the show a little bit, uh, moment, just so we can get squeezed more shows at it.

377
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:14,262
Speaker 0: But, uh, if you think, you know, in the United States, at least Hollywood, right.

378
00:27:14,363 --> 00:27:19,840
Speaker 0: And, you know, TV movie productions, movies basically always have soundtracks.

379
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:22,089
Speaker 0: Sometimes they might be original scores.

380
00:27:22,511 --> 00:27:27,711
Speaker 0: Sometimes they might just be, you know, new recordings of classical songs, old movies do that.

381
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:38,483
Speaker 0: Or sometimes they'll just be licensed pop songs, but you know, like, uh, or sometimes a combination thereof, but, uh, movies typically have OSTs.

382
00:27:38,543 --> 00:27:41,070
Speaker 0: It's hard to have a movie without a soundtrack, right?

383
00:27:41,472 --> 00:27:52,220
Speaker 0: TV shows in the United States rarely have a soundtrack, especially not an original score or name a song from a Seinfeld.

384
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,647
Speaker 1: There's the song.

385
00:27:54,788 --> 00:27:55,269
Speaker 0: Exactly.

386
00:27:55,289 --> 00:27:56,212
Speaker 0: That's it has one.

387
00:27:56,252 --> 00:27:57,596
Speaker 0: There's one song, right?

388
00:27:57,676 --> 00:28:00,725
Speaker 0: And a couple intro, outro riffs and a laugh track.

389
00:28:00,785 --> 00:28:06,764
Speaker 0: It's like, there's no OST, even if you have a serious drama show in the United States, right?

390
00:28:06,804 --> 00:28:12,545
Speaker 0: Think, um, you know, some of the mission impossible has got one song, right?

391
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:20,850
Speaker 1: It's got a few adjacent Zimmer-esque, but then we're getting into soundtrack versus score, which is a whole other conversation too.

392
00:28:21,172 --> 00:28:31,367
Speaker 0: Well, score is just a type of soundtrack, which is, you know, an original composition for the show, as opposed to already existing songs being collected into a soundtrack.

393
00:28:31,407 --> 00:28:31,588
Speaker 1: Yup.

394
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:35,162
Speaker 1: That's like a movie could have a soundtrack and a score, et cetera.

395
00:28:35,604 --> 00:28:52,252
Speaker 0: But, uh, I feel like the soundtrack is basically, I, so I guess, I don't know what the official definitions are, but my definitions that I've always gone by is that the soundtrack for a movie or show is all of the songs total, right.

396
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:55,918
Speaker 0: That are played during, right.

397
00:28:55,998 --> 00:29:00,130
Speaker 0: Included in the audio of the movie or show.

398
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:07,716
Speaker 0: So like you could have, you know, a lot of animes had like character albums and shit of like tracks that didn't actually play during the show.

399
00:29:08,358 --> 00:29:08,579
Speaker 0: Right.

400
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,382
Speaker 0: So those don't count.

401
00:29:09,744 --> 00:29:12,635
Speaker 0: It's gotta be like, I'm watching mission impossible.

402
00:29:12,675 --> 00:29:14,181
Speaker 0: I'm watching a James Bond movie.

403
00:29:14,241 --> 00:29:16,669
Speaker 0: And during the movie, it goes doo, doo, doo, doo.

404
00:29:16,991 --> 00:29:20,061
Speaker 0: That song is part of the soundtrack of the thing.

405
00:29:20,121 --> 00:29:22,948
Speaker 0: It's the, a score would be okay.

406
00:29:23,450 --> 00:29:26,037
Speaker 0: They stay specifically composed.

407
00:29:26,177 --> 00:29:30,671
Speaker 0: this collection of songs for this movie or TV show.

408
00:29:30,691 --> 00:29:33,279
Speaker 0: The score of Seinfeld is one is one song, right?

409
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,223
Speaker 0: It's right.

410
00:29:34,524 --> 00:29:35,930
Speaker 0: It has an original score.

411
00:29:35,990 --> 00:29:37,175
Speaker 0: It's only one song long.

412
00:29:37,215 --> 00:29:43,581
Speaker 1: And a big part, a big part of that in terms of like just the viewership and the enjoyment of these things is imagine like an anime.

413
00:29:43,601 --> 00:29:51,412
Speaker 1: We're talking about anime today where there's a song that clearly was made for the show and the scene was animated to match the song directly.

414
00:29:51,452 --> 00:29:55,285
Speaker 1: The song was not just like laid behind and edited together scene.

415
00:29:55,546 --> 00:29:58,656
Speaker 1: The song and the scene were conceived together.

416
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:02,168
Speaker 0: Well, that usually happens the most in musicals, right.

417
00:30:02,208 --> 00:30:05,782
Speaker 0: Where the characters are singing the song that is part of the soundtrack.

418
00:30:07,025 --> 00:30:23,397
Speaker 0: But you think something like, I don't know, Independence Day just has a score whereas something like The Matrix or Star Wars obviously has a score as its total soundtrack, but The Matrix has a score, but it also has Rage Against the Machine, right?

419
00:30:23,477 --> 00:30:31,924
Speaker 0: So it's not, it's a, the soundtrack includes the original score, but also includes already existing songs from the world.

420
00:30:32,345 --> 00:30:37,383
Speaker 1: So I think for this show, we're going to exclude movies because anime movies are just cheat mode.

421
00:30:37,443 --> 00:30:41,981
Speaker 1: Like the best music in all of anime is just a list of anime movies for the most part.

422
00:30:42,542 --> 00:31:00,383
Speaker 0: Well, the point, the fundamental point is that unlike American TV, right, Japanese animation typically has a score or at least a soundtrack to it, but quite often its own original score that you don't get.

423
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:04,956
Speaker 1: Like Sailor Moon has like nine OSTs, I want to say.

424
00:31:05,016 --> 00:31:05,197
Speaker 0: Right.

425
00:31:05,257 --> 00:31:14,048
Speaker 0: It's like, what's the, what's the soundtrack for fucking, I don't know, an American animation TV show, you know, name a song from Transformers.

426
00:31:15,152 --> 00:31:15,292
Speaker 0: Right.

427
00:31:15,312 --> 00:31:15,714
Speaker 0: There's one.

428
00:31:15,894 --> 00:31:19,866
Speaker 0: Well, Transformers, the movie has songs, but that's a collected, right?

429
00:31:21,029 --> 00:31:24,699
Speaker 0: You got Dexter's Lab, I guess has a song, the theme song.

430
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:33,147
Speaker 1: I guess like, so that's like in high school and college, like I'd listened to the soundtrack to Slayers, which is just a TV show.

431
00:31:33,167 --> 00:31:35,738
Speaker 1: I would just listen to that in my car while I was driving.

432
00:31:35,838 --> 00:31:41,420
Speaker 1: I would not listen to the background music from Deep Space Nine in my car while I was driving anywhere.

433
00:31:41,681 --> 00:31:42,765
Speaker 0: There's no such thing.

434
00:31:43,006 --> 00:31:50,374
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, it's like for anime, you go to the, if you go to a, you know, uh, a nerdy anime store, anime OSTs are a thing.

435
00:31:50,674 --> 00:31:52,801
Speaker 0: Why aren't OSTs a thing in the United States?

436
00:31:52,861 --> 00:31:54,827
Speaker 0: Cause things don't have an ST.

437
00:31:54,927 --> 00:32:01,168
Speaker 1: They increasingly are for newer works, just like games increasingly have them.

438
00:32:01,309 --> 00:32:09,340
Speaker 1: But if you look at American pop culture from like infinity up until maybe the two thousands, a lot of shows had nothing.

439
00:32:10,360 --> 00:32:19,210
Speaker 0: Even if they wanted to sell a soundtrack for Powerpuff girls, the TV show, it would be like two saw one song on a CD, a single.

440
00:32:19,310 --> 00:32:32,594
Speaker 0: it's like, you know, I think the only soundtracks I saw for cartoons and stuff when I was a kid from the U S were like, you know, uh, like cartoon planet, space ghost, like bad bug and what are the other tracks on there?

441
00:32:32,835 --> 00:32:33,075
Speaker 1: Yeah.

442
00:32:33,116 --> 00:32:35,926
Speaker 1: But now like people buy the Game of Thrones soundtrack.

443
00:32:36,067 --> 00:32:38,980
Speaker 1: Every video game that has original music sells that as an album.

444
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:45,688
Speaker 0: Like it's a very different time in the U S but there's more video game soundtracks than animation soundtracks in the U S.

445
00:32:45,728 --> 00:32:53,338
Speaker 1: But I guess if you were an American anime fan, who's about our age, you would never experience that really until you found anime.

446
00:32:53,378 --> 00:32:56,791
Speaker 1: And then you were like, wait, why is there this $40 CD for slayers?

447
00:32:56,852 --> 00:32:59,361
Speaker 1: I guess slayers has a good music and there's just all this music.

448
00:32:59,401 --> 00:32:59,883
Speaker 1: That's great.

449
00:33:01,087 --> 00:33:01,247
Speaker 0: Yeah.

450
00:33:01,267 --> 00:33:09,192
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot, when I was still buying cassettes, CDs, a good percentage of them were soundtracks to the few things that had them.

451
00:33:09,353 --> 00:33:09,614
Speaker 0: Yup.

452
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:09,895
Speaker 0: Right.

453
00:33:10,617 --> 00:33:15,676
Speaker 1: I had a lot of CDs that were just the soundtrack to Indiana Jones, the soundtrack to star Wars.

454
00:33:16,358 --> 00:33:16,800
Speaker 0: Exactly.

455
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:30,022
Speaker 0: Those are, those are real good, by the way, if you listen, I highly recommend, uh, empire strikes back OST, it's probably on Spotify, but you'll hear a lot of stuff in there that you don't hear in the movie.

456
00:33:30,324 --> 00:33:36,545
Speaker 0: Not because it wasn't in the movie, but because you know, someone's talking or there's an X-wing exploding or something.

457
00:33:37,589 --> 00:33:50,460
Speaker 1: Um, so in terms of anime in particular, that's sort of why anime music looms large in the American anime fan community, because this was something that we've just generally hadn't experienced from television shows in our lives up to that point.

458
00:33:50,841 --> 00:33:56,098
Speaker 1: And also the novelty of it was music that was not available and on the radio either.

459
00:33:56,118 --> 00:34:00,634
Speaker 1: It was almost this perfect storm of getting me obsessed with like Megumi Hayashibara.

460
00:34:01,237 --> 00:34:01,417
Speaker 0: Right.

461
00:34:01,478 --> 00:34:02,501
Speaker 0: I'm watching this show.

462
00:34:02,742 --> 00:34:06,072
Speaker 0: The show has a score, like a fucking movie does.

463
00:34:06,614 --> 00:34:08,440
Speaker 0: The quality of it is unbelievable.

464
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:14,219
Speaker 0: The genre of it is one that often I haven't heard before, sometimes depending on the show.

465
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:18,831
Speaker 0: Uh, it's really catchy and I want to listen to it more.

466
00:34:18,851 --> 00:34:28,232
Speaker 0: And look, I was able to find, it's hard to get, but because we have internet powers and eventually globalization powers, we're finally able to get it and listen to it all we want.

467
00:34:28,654 --> 00:34:29,679
Speaker 0: Oh my God, this is amazing.

468
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:39,270
Speaker 1: So in 2007, we did an episode on anime openers and closers, and I actually bring that up because one, I'll link to it, but two, kind of make a point.

469
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:45,292
Speaker 1: I think if we want to talk about like, what is a good OST, like a good anime soundtrack or song?

470
00:34:45,974 --> 00:34:56,293
Speaker 1: The concept of a good soundtrack for a show could be very different in terms of, is it good because it had a really good opener, but did the, or did the show use the music?

471
00:34:56,353 --> 00:34:58,000
Speaker 1: Was the music an integral part of the show?

472
00:34:58,360 --> 00:35:01,634
Speaker 1: Do you remember any music from the show other than the opener or closer?

473
00:35:02,237 --> 00:35:04,223
Speaker 0: That's, I think that's usually my criteria.

474
00:35:04,243 --> 00:35:04,745
Speaker 1: Yeah.

475
00:35:05,086 --> 00:35:16,239
Speaker 1: So as much as Kill La Kill has that song, Kill La Kill didn't have particularly memorable music other than that song and the power of its opener and closer to me.

476
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I probably, if you played, if you played it, I'd probably be like, oh, that's familiar.

477
00:35:21,840 --> 00:35:22,443
Speaker 0: What's that from?

478
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:22,925
Speaker 1: Yep.

479
00:35:23,367 --> 00:35:25,979
Speaker 1: But if you play don't lose your way, I'm like, yeah, there it is.

480
00:35:26,320 --> 00:35:26,904
Speaker 0: Don't lose your way.

481
00:35:26,944 --> 00:35:27,830
Speaker 0: I know what that is.

482
00:35:27,850 --> 00:35:28,273
Speaker 1: Same thing.

483
00:35:28,293 --> 00:35:30,062
Speaker 1: A lot of people talk about Attack on Titan's music.

484
00:35:30,323 --> 00:35:32,793
Speaker 1: Attack on Titan also has basically one song.

485
00:35:33,194 --> 00:35:35,343
Speaker 0: that the first, I only remember the first opener.

486
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:36,447
Speaker 0: I can't remember anything else.

487
00:35:36,527 --> 00:35:36,748
Speaker 0: Same.

488
00:35:37,511 --> 00:35:47,286
Speaker 1: So, uh, I dunno, I guess we can go back and forth and just call out in our, our minds, the best anime soundtracks on those criteria of they're actually good in the show.

489
00:35:47,426 --> 00:35:51,702
Speaker 0: Not just, I don't know if there's that many that I could think of.

490
00:35:51,822 --> 00:35:53,728
Speaker 1: I spent about 10 minutes.

491
00:35:53,768 --> 00:35:55,434
Speaker 1: I came up with about 10.

492
00:35:55,434 --> 00:35:56,056
Speaker 0: All right.

493
00:35:56,096 --> 00:36:03,157
Speaker 0: So I could think of ones that are memorable or like, you know, that I list that I listened to intentionally, right?

494
00:36:03,478 --> 00:36:04,842
Speaker 0: When I wasn't watching the show.

495
00:36:05,103 --> 00:36:05,384
Speaker 1: That's it.

496
00:36:05,424 --> 00:36:14,754
Speaker 0: Like do I have an MP3 folder from that show in my, once I have an MP3 folder for, or that I have like on a playlist on Spotify or something.

497
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:14,995
Speaker 0: Right.

498
00:36:15,035 --> 00:36:22,234
Speaker 0: So, uh, the first one, I guess the Macross TV show soundtrack, which has, right.

499
00:36:22,274 --> 00:36:24,500
Speaker 0: It's full of city pop ish tracks.

500
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,092
Speaker 0: Those old school steel guitar while planes are flying.

501
00:36:29,173 --> 00:36:30,396
Speaker 1: This is why it's tough.

502
00:36:30,577 --> 00:36:35,355
Speaker 1: I thought of 10 and I did not think of all the, the min-may musical tracks.

503
00:36:35,516 --> 00:36:36,721
Speaker 1: I didn't think of Macross at all.

504
00:36:36,782 --> 00:36:40,081
Speaker 1: And as soon as you said it, my brain immediately remembered all the music from that show.

505
00:36:40,242 --> 00:36:41,627
Speaker 0: Macross is about music.

506
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:45,540
Speaker 0: Even Macross seven, literally about music.

507
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:48,410
Speaker 1: Macross seven didn't have as good a music as the TV show.

508
00:36:48,651 --> 00:36:52,222
Speaker 0: But it mean, but all Macross is literally about music.

509
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:57,873
Speaker 0: So, uh, that it would, it would be kind of bad if it didn't have a soundtrack.

510
00:36:57,973 --> 00:37:10,571
Speaker 1: Well, it's just classical music pieces, I guess, but I don't think it counts because the actual, anything that was original in the show, wasn't that great.

511
00:37:11,414 --> 00:37:15,188
Speaker 1: And the music that they used in the show, isn't that deep.

512
00:37:15,208 --> 00:37:17,537
Speaker 1: Like I'm not listening to the Nodame soundtrack.

513
00:37:17,597 --> 00:37:21,346
Speaker 1: I'm listening to Rachmaninoff's album, I guess.

514
00:37:21,628 --> 00:37:21,869
Speaker 0: Right.

515
00:37:22,391 --> 00:37:27,508
Speaker 0: I guess the lowest tangy fruit in the universe is Cowboy Bebop, right?

516
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:31,661
Speaker 1: I mean, Cowboy Bebop and Eska Flonay are the two that I actually put at the top of my list.

517
00:37:32,163 --> 00:37:34,591
Speaker 0: I thought Utenna would be at the top of my list.

518
00:37:34,611 --> 00:37:37,903
Speaker 1: Utenna and Giant Robo are tied at number three in my list.

519
00:37:38,484 --> 00:37:39,086
Speaker 0: Number three?

520
00:37:39,207 --> 00:37:40,932
Speaker 0: Okay.

521
00:37:41,012 --> 00:37:43,018
Speaker 0: I don't, I don't see the hype for the Giant Robo.

522
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:46,773
Speaker 0: Giant Robo, I think, I can't even remember the opening song for Giant Robo.

523
00:37:46,873 --> 00:37:47,797
Speaker 1: I can remember it.

524
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:56,242
Speaker 1: Giant Robo, I think has one of the best constructed original orchestral soundtracks of scores to any anime show ever.

525
00:37:56,483 --> 00:38:00,074
Speaker 0: It definitely has an original orchestral soundtrack.

526
00:38:00,114 --> 00:38:03,750
Speaker 0: I couldn't recognize a single damn song from it and I watched the whole show.

527
00:38:03,770 --> 00:38:08,087
Speaker 1: I remember them all intimately because every character has a leitmotif in the entire show.

528
00:38:08,789 --> 00:38:20,207
Speaker 1: Every score element, the show is scored beginning to end and the leitmotifs interleave with each other through the show, depending on who's on screen or who's important.

529
00:38:20,909 --> 00:38:25,322
Speaker 1: I think it's one of the most iconic anime television show soundtracks of all time.

530
00:38:27,368 --> 00:38:28,873
Speaker 1: I will stand by that to my death.

531
00:38:29,134 --> 00:38:31,662
Speaker 0: However, I can't, I can't remember one damn song from it.

532
00:38:31,723 --> 00:38:44,379
Speaker 1: However, Cowboy Vivaf and Eska Flonay in particular, partly because of the Yokohakano factor, have such sprawling scores, such sprawling soundtracks, the breadth of genres.

533
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,510
Speaker 0: Even, you know, Giant Robo doesn't have that many episodes.

534
00:38:47,711 --> 00:38:49,641
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also Giant Robo does one thing.

535
00:38:49,721 --> 00:38:51,085
Speaker 1: It is like an opera.

536
00:38:51,306 --> 00:38:53,713
Speaker 1: It is just opera songs after opera songs.

537
00:38:53,994 --> 00:38:57,266
Speaker 1: There's no like radically different genre in there.

538
00:38:57,326 --> 00:39:08,220
Speaker 1: The Giant Robo soundtrack goes from beginning to end, but Eska Flonay goes from opera to weird pop songs to ridiculous nonsense and Cowboy Vivaf goes even further.

539
00:39:09,102 --> 00:39:09,343
Speaker 0: Right.

540
00:39:09,363 --> 00:39:11,473
Speaker 0: I mean, that's, that's the real challenge, right?

541
00:39:11,513 --> 00:39:23,558
Speaker 0: It's one thing to be like Star Wars, where you have, you know, a certain set of, you know, motifs and themes that you keep remixing and combining and rehashing and, you know, over and over right into different tracks.

542
00:39:23,919 --> 00:39:29,875
Speaker 0: It's another thing completely to have 26 episodes of a show or even just 13.

543
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:35,591
Speaker 0: And not, and you've got different music on each episode, but also the same music.

544
00:39:36,013 --> 00:39:41,611
Speaker 0: But even though you've got a song you're using like once in episode seven or some shit, right?

545
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:44,180
Speaker 0: It's still fucking legendary and phenomenal.

546
00:39:44,562 --> 00:39:46,089
Speaker 0: And then you just never go back to it again.

547
00:39:46,250 --> 00:39:47,737
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, I got another one.

548
00:39:47,758 --> 00:39:48,862
Speaker 0: I don't need to use that one again.

549
00:39:48,882 --> 00:39:49,465
Speaker 0: Right.

550
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:52,436
Speaker 0: Even John Williams needs to go back and use that one again.

551
00:39:52,476 --> 00:39:53,881
Speaker 0: Yoko Kanno doesn't.

552
00:39:54,263 --> 00:39:54,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's it.

553
00:39:54,985 --> 00:39:59,380
Speaker 1: So Eska Flonay is 26 episodes and has more OSTs than I remember.

554
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:03,456
Speaker 0: Like there's so much music, but then- You know how many CDs there are?

555
00:40:03,476 --> 00:40:06,969
Speaker 0: There's like Cowboy Vivaf box sets just for 26 episodes of show.

556
00:40:07,270 --> 00:40:09,317
Speaker 0: They got fucking CD box sets for that thing.

557
00:40:09,759 --> 00:40:18,563
Speaker 1: But meanwhile, another 26 episode show from that era that didn't have the Yoko Kanno factor has one CD with like seven songs on it.

558
00:40:18,904 --> 00:40:19,987
Speaker 1: Same number of episodes.

559
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:20,989
Speaker 0: Yep.

560
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:22,493
Speaker 1: I think so.

561
00:40:22,794 --> 00:40:30,837
Speaker 1: Utena stands out in that to this day, I have never encountered an anime or really anything that has music like J.H.

562
00:40:30,938 --> 00:40:31,580
Speaker 1: Azar's music.

563
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:37,298
Speaker 0: I mean, the dude has made other non-Utena music and it all sounds like that.

564
00:40:37,339 --> 00:40:41,090
Speaker 0: But yeah, is he a unique composer in that there's.

565
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:49,800
Speaker 0: a lot of musicians in general will get or criticized for having like one note, like all their stuff sounds the same.

566
00:40:50,821 --> 00:40:53,167
Speaker 0: Yep.

567
00:40:53,207 --> 00:41:03,877
Speaker 0: But as long as your stuff doesn't sound like anyone else's stuff, what's wrong with knowing your sound, it being a good sound and sticking to it, right?

568
00:41:03,938 --> 00:41:04,901
Speaker 0: I don't see anything wrong with that.

569
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:10,988
Speaker 0: You might get played out eventually, like people get tired of you, but you know, look at like Eurobeat guy Dave Rogers.

570
00:41:11,028 --> 00:41:11,309
Speaker 0: He's just.

571
00:41:11,932 --> 00:41:12,855
Speaker 0: he is what he is.

572
00:41:12,976 --> 00:41:13,197
Speaker 0: Right.

573
00:41:13,237 --> 00:41:14,000
Speaker 0: He's happy with it.

574
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:14,260
Speaker 0: Right.

575
00:41:14,281 --> 00:41:14,843
Speaker 0: He sticks to it.

576
00:41:14,863 --> 00:41:16,089
Speaker 0: He's like, this is who I am.

577
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:17,616
Speaker 0: I'm Eurobeat guy, Dave Rogers.

578
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:18,360
Speaker 0: I make Eurobeat.

579
00:41:18,801 --> 00:41:19,202
Speaker 0: I love it.

580
00:41:19,443 --> 00:41:19,664
Speaker 0: Right.

581
00:41:19,804 --> 00:41:20,587
Speaker 0: So J.H.

582
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:21,390
Speaker 0: Azar is like.

583
00:41:21,430 --> 00:41:23,176
Speaker 0: that is like I make this music.

584
00:41:23,517 --> 00:41:25,164
Speaker 0: It doesn't sound like anyone else's music.

585
00:41:25,244 --> 00:41:26,670
Speaker 0: It's it sounds like I made it.

586
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:28,075
Speaker 0: No one else sounds like it.

587
00:41:28,396 --> 00:41:28,778
Speaker 0: I stick to it.

588
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:29,481
Speaker 0: Yeah.

589
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:29,983
Speaker 0: All right.

590
00:41:30,646 --> 00:41:32,997
Speaker 0: And I only applied it to one thing, which is Utena.

591
00:41:33,097 --> 00:41:35,767
Speaker 0: And therefore Utena doesn't sound like anything else either.

592
00:41:36,169 --> 00:41:36,389
Speaker 1: Yep.

593
00:41:36,751 --> 00:41:44,542
Speaker 1: And like I listen to the Utena soundtrack just kind of randomly throughout my life, like a few weeks ago, I was just listening to it because it's good.

594
00:41:44,743 --> 00:41:44,944
Speaker 0: Yep.

595
00:41:45,366 --> 00:41:48,760
Speaker 0: And, you know, Utena has also the structural element of the dual song.

596
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:49,261
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:41:49,302 --> 00:41:52,211
Speaker 0: Which is not a lot of shows have that.

598
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:52,693
Speaker 1: Yes.

599
00:41:52,733 --> 00:41:54,780
Speaker 1: But then the dual songs are that show.

600
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:56,846
Speaker 1: The rest of the show is other styles.

601
00:41:57,569 --> 00:42:00,840
Speaker 0: It's a lot like how Initial D has the Eurobeat song for the race.

602
00:42:00,980 --> 00:42:01,241
Speaker 1: Yep.

603
00:42:01,562 --> 00:42:04,571
Speaker 1: So Initial D is like next down on my list.

604
00:42:05,132 --> 00:42:06,476
Speaker 0: It's not a score, though.

605
00:42:06,617 --> 00:42:06,878
Speaker 0: No.

606
00:42:07,138 --> 00:42:09,224
Speaker 0: But in that, I guess it's a it's a it.

607
00:42:09,244 --> 00:42:13,678
Speaker 0: those all those tracks existed on superhero beat CDs.

608
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:19,083
Speaker 1: I was thinking about what did the music do for the show in that case, in that Initial D saved it from being complete garbage.

609
00:42:19,103 --> 00:42:21,332
Speaker 1: Initial D with any other music or no music.

610
00:42:21,513 --> 00:42:23,080
Speaker 1: I would never have watched that show.

611
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,669
Speaker 1: I would have peaced out halfway through the first episode.

612
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:25,970
Speaker 1: Never.

613
00:42:26,331 --> 00:42:35,278
Speaker 1: But the Eurobeat, much like Ewan M1 in Doom 1, just pumps you up like it drives the show just like the show has it in it.

614
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,604
Speaker 1: Similarly, the Giant Robo.

615
00:42:38,684 --> 00:42:43,520
Speaker 1: Well, as beautifully animated as it is, the music drives that mood.

616
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:50,862
Speaker 1: Escaflowne, like the epic scale of that fantasy is really enhanced by the epic scale and grandeur of the music.

617
00:42:51,263 --> 00:42:55,315
Speaker 1: So shows like Slayers, the music is great.

618
00:42:55,375 --> 00:43:00,290
Speaker 1: Like I love all those openers and closers, but it doesn't really do anything for the show itself.

619
00:43:02,116 --> 00:43:06,593
Speaker 1: The sound, the music that just happens in the course of the show, pretty forgettable, to be honest.

620
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:10,748
Speaker 1: The Megumi Hashibara stuff is mostly openers and closers or like big dramatic moments.

621
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:24,606
Speaker 0: It's interesting how some, I guess, you know, low rent off the shelf Eurobeat music can elevate Initial D from trash to something special, at least I'll say something special.

622
00:43:24,747 --> 00:43:26,455
Speaker 1: Yes, you didn't say good.

623
00:43:26,475 --> 00:43:27,620
Speaker 1: I agree with you said special.

624
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:28,222
Speaker 1: That's important.

625
00:43:28,663 --> 00:43:29,205
Speaker 0: Something special.

626
00:43:29,245 --> 00:43:29,446
Speaker 0: Right.

627
00:43:29,787 --> 00:43:33,519
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, the quite prolific Yugi Kaedra.

628
00:43:34,641 --> 00:43:35,705
Speaker 1: That's next on my list.

629
00:43:36,267 --> 00:43:36,528
Speaker 0: Right.

630
00:43:36,588 --> 00:43:38,395
Speaker 0: Yugi Kaedra has made soundtracks.

631
00:43:38,435 --> 00:43:45,236
Speaker 0: We have the same taste in anime music, except for an enormous amount of anime and continues to do so.

632
00:43:45,256 --> 00:43:48,284
Speaker 0: Even like Demon Slayer and stuff, right, is Yuki Kaedra.

633
00:43:48,304 --> 00:43:51,653
Speaker 0: You know, Kimigori, Orange Road was Yuki Kaedra.

634
00:43:51,834 --> 00:43:52,516
Speaker 0: Right.

635
00:43:52,536 --> 00:43:57,934
Speaker 0: But and it all sounds much like Jay Cesar, Yuki Kaedra soundtracks.

636
00:43:57,954 --> 00:43:59,660
Speaker 0: You can tell right away who did it.

637
00:44:00,021 --> 00:44:01,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just immediately obvious.

638
00:44:02,447 --> 00:44:02,627
Speaker 0: Right.

639
00:44:03,429 --> 00:44:14,500
Speaker 0: But even though that music is often incredible, it doesn't seem to have the power to elevate a poop show to anything more than what the show is.

640
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,725
Speaker 0: We've done this on gig nights.

641
00:44:15,765 --> 00:44:19,841
Speaker 1: It tricked us in that it would get us to watch a show that wasn't good.

642
00:44:20,223 --> 00:44:25,601
Speaker 1: But once the magic wore off, like at the end of Noir or halfway through Hack Sign, the spell broke.

643
00:44:25,621 --> 00:44:27,990
Speaker 1: And I was like, wait a minute, only the music's good.

644
00:44:28,472 --> 00:44:29,336
Speaker 1: The music tricked me.

645
00:44:29,356 --> 00:44:31,705
Speaker 0: But it's like Sword Art Online.

646
00:44:31,986 --> 00:44:35,018
Speaker 0: Probably, you know, you go to go to Spotify, find the Sword Art Online OST.

647
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:36,003
Speaker 0: It's even on there.

648
00:44:36,023 --> 00:44:36,505
Speaker 0: Right.

649
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:37,430
Speaker 0: It's like it's going to.

650
00:44:37,791 --> 00:44:42,510
Speaker 0: I've never listened to it, but I'm willing to bet that it's an amazing Yuki Kaedra soundtrack.

651
00:44:42,611 --> 00:44:45,541
Speaker 0: But I also know for a fact Sword Art Online is not good.

652
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:45,962
Speaker 0: Yeah.

653
00:44:46,002 --> 00:44:46,625
Speaker 1: Right.

654
00:44:46,825 --> 00:44:50,999
Speaker 0: And the soundtrack, for some reason, her music doesn't have that.

655
00:44:51,019 --> 00:44:54,129
Speaker 0: Even though it's amazing, there's something about it.

656
00:44:54,189 --> 00:44:56,997
Speaker 0: It cannot bring the show up at all.

657
00:44:57,078 --> 00:44:57,719
Speaker 0: But it got real.

658
00:44:58,101 --> 00:45:00,047
Speaker 1: do real close.

659
00:45:00,288 --> 00:45:03,177
Speaker 1: Well, partly it was that Initial D did have something going on.

660
00:45:03,218 --> 00:45:05,104
Speaker 1: It's got that scene where he washes the car.

661
00:45:05,445 --> 00:45:06,729
Speaker 0: That like there is.

662
00:45:07,010 --> 00:45:10,080
Speaker 1: however small that emotional arc is, it's there.

663
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,532
Speaker 1: But with Hack Sign and Noir, I guess the difference is.

664
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:16,672
Speaker 1: when I got to the end of Initial D, I didn't think back and say, wow, fuck that.

665
00:45:16,873 --> 00:45:17,978
Speaker 1: Only the Eurobeat was good.

666
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,522
Speaker 1: I thought, I like that show.

667
00:45:19,603 --> 00:45:19,944
Speaker 1: OK.

668
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:26,926
Speaker 1: When I got to the end of Noir, I thought, wow, I got fucking tricked and that was a waste of my time.

669
00:45:26,946 --> 00:45:28,673
Speaker 1: I should have just listened to this OST.

670
00:45:28,974 --> 00:45:31,062
Speaker 1: I am angry that I watched this show.

671
00:45:31,784 --> 00:45:31,984
Speaker 0: Right.

672
00:45:32,466 --> 00:45:41,876
Speaker 0: I think what I guess the food analogy would be that like, you know, other music might act as like a fancy spice that like saffron or some shit.

673
00:45:41,936 --> 00:45:42,077
Speaker 0: Right.

674
00:45:42,097 --> 00:45:46,270
Speaker 0: Where it's like you put some saffron on some bland food or you really make it magical.

675
00:45:46,290 --> 00:45:46,531
Speaker 0: Right.

676
00:45:46,972 --> 00:45:50,022
Speaker 0: But Yuki Kaedra's music is just salt.

677
00:45:50,363 --> 00:45:50,583
Speaker 0: Right.

678
00:45:50,644 --> 00:45:53,873
Speaker 0: So salt can make, you know, food taste better.

679
00:45:53,893 --> 00:45:54,796
Speaker 0: Right.

680
00:45:54,816 --> 00:45:57,705
Speaker 1: It can trick you into thinking that not great food is good.

681
00:45:58,648 --> 00:45:58,848
Speaker 0: Right.

682
00:45:58,929 --> 00:46:01,737
Speaker 0: But bad food with salt is just salty bad food.

683
00:46:02,098 --> 00:46:09,967
Speaker 0: But when you put that salt on a good show, right, like, you know, Madoka Magica or something, it's like, oh, yeah, it needed that salt.

684
00:46:10,027 --> 00:46:10,248
Speaker 0: Right.

685
00:46:10,288 --> 00:46:15,525
Speaker 0: To make it, you know, Madoka Magica would be a worse show without that music.

686
00:46:16,126 --> 00:46:18,754
Speaker 0: You know, but you couldn't save a bad show with it.

687
00:46:18,814 --> 00:46:19,175
Speaker 0: Yeah.

688
00:46:19,195 --> 00:46:20,098
Speaker 0: There you go.

689
00:46:20,278 --> 00:46:24,471
Speaker 0: So similarly, yeah, she she has done a lot of a lot of stuff.

690
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:28,363
Speaker 1: Evangelion, I think, had a fantastic soundtrack in that it's.

691
00:46:28,985 --> 00:46:36,129
Speaker 1: it's as close to background music from an anime that would otherwise be incidental that I will occasionally listen to on purpose for no reason.

692
00:46:37,293 --> 00:46:38,015
Speaker 0: Yeah.

693
00:46:38,396 --> 00:46:43,070
Speaker 0: The thing with the Evangelion soundtrack is it's there are other songs to it.

694
00:46:43,150 --> 00:46:43,370
Speaker 0: Right.

695
00:46:43,511 --> 00:46:43,852
Speaker 0: Yeah.

696
00:46:43,912 --> 00:46:47,241
Speaker 1: But it's really thinking of that one song.

697
00:46:47,281 --> 00:46:49,627
Speaker 1: Doo doo doo doo doo doo.

698
00:46:49,747 --> 00:46:57,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's called which is not that far off from the some of the doom music that also pumps me up in similar ways.

699
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,353
Speaker 0: Doo doo doo.

700
00:46:59,374 --> 00:47:00,176
Speaker 1: The timpani.

701
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:00,939
Speaker 0: The song.

702
00:47:00,979 --> 00:47:02,423
Speaker 0: The song is called Decisive Battle.

703
00:47:02,443 --> 00:47:03,386
Speaker 1: That's the one.

704
00:47:03,848 --> 00:47:12,334
Speaker 0: But it's got a bunch of different versions, I guess, of it or I don't know, renditions, whatever you want to call it.

705
00:47:12,435 --> 00:47:13,498
Speaker 1: Often a song like that.

706
00:47:13,518 --> 00:47:15,704
Speaker 1: The way to think like Giant Robo does this is.

707
00:47:15,785 --> 00:47:21,362
Speaker 1: it's a theme that is used in different songs along the way, possibly in different ways.

708
00:47:22,244 --> 00:47:28,584
Speaker 0: It's not the only song from the Evangelion score that besides the opener and closer that stands out.

709
00:47:28,624 --> 00:47:28,785
Speaker 0: Right.

710
00:47:28,805 --> 00:47:29,106
Speaker 0: There's the.

711
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:30,251
Speaker 0: there's the hanging out at home one.

712
00:47:30,291 --> 00:47:31,396
Speaker 1: Doo doo doo doo doo.

713
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:34,428
Speaker 1: But that's why I put Ava much lower on my list.

714
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:41,515
Speaker 1: That music was extremely integral to the mood of Evangelion, but it was not a great OST by itself.

715
00:47:41,696 --> 00:47:45,467
Speaker 1: Like it was the case where it was a necessary component of Evangelion.

716
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:57,181
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has a few songs that really stand out and are used to great effect for mood setting and are very memorable and perhaps even listenable on their own.

717
00:47:57,723 --> 00:48:01,814
Speaker 0: But there's not a lot of them that aren't openers and closers.

718
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,604
Speaker 0: It's like the same couple ones used over and over again.

719
00:48:05,644 --> 00:48:13,403
Speaker 0: And in fact, I guess Anno is, you know, is I don't know if it's Shin Godzilla.

720
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:16,195
Speaker 0: He's using the same decisive battle song again.

721
00:48:16,275 --> 00:48:16,536
Speaker 0: It's like.

722
00:48:16,556 --> 00:48:18,704
Speaker 0: it's like you can't find another song to use.

723
00:48:18,905 --> 00:48:24,885
Speaker 0: You just keep using the same palette of colors of musical colors and all his his works there.

724
00:48:24,905 --> 00:48:28,717
Speaker 0: You know, it's sort of like, all right, I love that song, too.

725
00:48:28,737 --> 00:48:30,021
Speaker 0: It gets me pumped.

726
00:48:30,342 --> 00:48:40,788
Speaker 1: But yeah, but like I won't just sit and listen to the entire Ava OST in an evening, like while I'm working on something necessarily.

727
00:48:41,109 --> 00:48:44,681
Speaker 1: But I will absolutely do that with Escaflowne in a heartbeat.

728
00:48:46,789 --> 00:48:48,154
Speaker 1: And now I'm already getting near the bottom.

729
00:48:48,174 --> 00:48:50,381
Speaker 1: Like I'm starting running out of shows fast.

730
00:48:50,422 --> 00:48:53,633
Speaker 1: Like now I'm at the level of like Gundam Seed, which it worked.

731
00:48:53,813 --> 00:49:00,980
Speaker 1: Like those the songs from the pivotal moments of that show are still burned into my brain, like when the mass driver takes off.

732
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:06,880
Speaker 1: But outside of those scenes, I forget pretty much any background music from that show at all.

733
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:07,462
Speaker 1: Right.

734
00:49:07,682 --> 00:49:09,789
Speaker 0: Well, I think that this goes to a problem.

735
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:15,490
Speaker 0: The problem I'm betting I'm leading towards is a problem with us, because that's an easier explanation.

736
00:49:15,852 --> 00:49:21,038
Speaker 0: But there is an alternate explanation, which is like, OK, most of these shows we mentioned are like hella old, right?

737
00:49:21,058 --> 00:49:28,644
Speaker 0: That's because we're hella old and we watched a lot of these old anime and we didn't watch as many newer anime.

738
00:49:28,985 --> 00:49:36,549
Speaker 0: So therefore, we're not familiar with the newer shows or we don't like them or we didn't hear their soundtracks to point them out as being good.

739
00:49:37,231 --> 00:49:44,216
Speaker 0: But it could also just be that, you know, newer shows are less often having, you know, because it's not like.

740
00:49:44,236 --> 00:49:45,642
Speaker 0: I haven't watched any new anime.

741
00:49:46,003 --> 00:49:46,244
Speaker 0: Right.

742
00:49:46,304 --> 00:49:48,232
Speaker 0: It's like, what's the newest?

743
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:50,139
Speaker 0: You know, I've watched some newer shows.

744
00:49:50,179 --> 00:49:59,996
Speaker 1: Well, but more to the point, I've been watching a lot of non anime animation and other TV shows and their scores better than half the stuff on my list just now.

745
00:50:00,137 --> 00:50:01,542
Speaker 1: Like I'm listening to them directly.

746
00:50:01,582 --> 00:50:04,373
Speaker 1: Like I listen to the Centaur World soundtrack a bunch.

747
00:50:04,654 --> 00:50:06,862
Speaker 1: The Arkane soundtrack is fantastic.

748
00:50:06,923 --> 00:50:13,946
Speaker 1: Like there there are recent shows where I have really enjoyed the OSTs and I would put them on this list, except they're not anime.

749
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:18,243
Speaker 0: But I'm talking like, you know, there are anime specifically.

750
00:50:18,264 --> 00:50:23,362
Speaker 1: The other thing is I can pick out like Beastars, the first and second, especially the second.

751
00:50:23,503 --> 00:50:25,309
Speaker 0: Beastars does not have an OST.

752
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,132
Speaker 0: Yeah.

753
00:50:26,333 --> 00:50:29,625
Speaker 0: But the openers, what's the other beast one that are fantastic?

754
00:50:29,645 --> 00:50:30,066
Speaker 1: BNA.

755
00:50:30,809 --> 00:50:31,010
Speaker 0: Yeah.

756
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:31,973
Speaker 0: BNA doesn't really have.

757
00:50:31,993 --> 00:50:33,178
Speaker 1: BNA has a rockin' opener.

758
00:50:33,218 --> 00:50:33,760
Speaker 1: This is the problem.

759
00:50:33,860 --> 00:50:34,683
Speaker 1: A lot of the anime.

760
00:50:34,744 --> 00:50:41,830
Speaker 1: I like the music from that's more recent, the openers and closers might be A plus or even S tier standout songs.

761
00:50:42,352 --> 00:50:44,900
Speaker 0: But then the music artist anime that one doesn't really have.

762
00:50:45,300 --> 00:50:45,521
Speaker 1: Yeah.

763
00:50:45,841 --> 00:50:50,414
Speaker 1: The music in the show is just not at the level of like a cowboy bebop.

764
00:50:51,276 --> 00:50:51,517
Speaker 0: Yeah.

765
00:50:51,958 --> 00:50:55,770
Speaker 0: You know, of the I've seen more recent anime TV shows.

766
00:50:55,830 --> 00:50:56,693
Speaker 0: I have watched some.

767
00:50:56,974 --> 00:50:57,315
Speaker 0: Right.

768
00:50:57,616 --> 00:50:59,862
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the lead.

769
00:50:59,902 --> 00:51:03,917
Speaker 0: There just isn't anything about their their soundtracks and scores.

770
00:51:03,958 --> 00:51:10,581
Speaker 0: that's during the show that sticks with me or makes me want to go get the OST or add it to a playlist or anything like that.

771
00:51:11,664 --> 00:51:14,472
Speaker 0: It's been a long time since an anime TV show did that.

772
00:51:15,454 --> 00:51:17,680
Speaker 0: But movies do that very frequently.

773
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:18,162
Speaker 0: Yeah.

774
00:51:18,182 --> 00:51:19,227
Speaker 0: That's how movies roll.

775
00:51:19,508 --> 00:51:28,707
Speaker 1: Generally, the way I roll is I'll see a movie and if it had a good score, I'm probably listening to the score like off and on, semi on loop for about a week, like right after I watch the movie.

776
00:51:29,470 --> 00:51:29,671
Speaker 0: Yep.

777
00:51:30,133 --> 00:51:31,319
Speaker 0: That's that's how movies do.

778
00:51:33,801 --> 00:51:34,122
Speaker 1: All right.

779
00:51:34,203 --> 00:51:39,503
Speaker 1: I think we did a show there and we left room to talk about this topic and other areas in the future.

780
00:51:39,523 --> 00:51:40,667
Speaker 1: Yeah.

781
00:51:40,767 --> 00:51:41,349
Speaker 1: Very important.

782
00:51:42,212 --> 00:51:44,360

793
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:42,029
Speaker 1: So yeah, not a lot going on right now.

794
00:52:42,872 --> 00:52:44,216
Speaker 1: Things are slowly opening up.

795
00:52:44,337 --> 00:52:45,742
Speaker 1: New York might get a big blizzard.

796
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:51,022
Speaker 1: Hopefully it's not big enough to lose internet so we can do a show like normal on Tuesday.

797
00:52:51,042 --> 00:52:52,226
Speaker 1: I assume it'll be fine.

798
00:52:52,748 --> 00:52:58,548
Speaker 1: But we're very likely done with The Tale of Genji, so Thursday next week you're going to see that first show.

799
00:52:58,950 --> 00:53:01,540
Speaker 1: And for now, I leave you with...

800
00:53:12,401 --> 00:53:13,879
Speaker 0: Drop, drop, purple drop.

801
00:53:14,120 --> 00:53:15,040
Speaker 0: Where's this elevator going?

802
00:53:15,341 --> 00:53:15,715
Speaker 0: To the top.

803
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,700
Speaker 0: Everybody come aboard for the gerbil drop.

804
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:18,538
Speaker 1: What's a gerbil drop?

805
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:19,578
Speaker 0: I'll show you at the town.

806
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:21,319
Speaker 0: Drop, drop, gerbil drop.

807
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:23,270
Speaker 0: So say you got a friend who's frozen in the ice.

808
00:53:23,310 --> 00:53:24,175
Speaker 0: Don't leave him in the ice.

809
00:53:24,255 --> 00:53:25,060
Speaker 0: Do something nice.

810
00:53:25,400 --> 00:53:26,969
Speaker 1: Use his ripple neck to take him to the top.

811
00:53:27,009 --> 00:53:28,840
Speaker 1: We'll see you at the bottom of the gerbil drop.
