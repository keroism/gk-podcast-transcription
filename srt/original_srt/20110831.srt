1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,511
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, August 31st, 2011.

2
00:00:12,511 --> 00:00:13,012
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,193 --> 00:00:13,734
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:15,520
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,280 --> 00:00:21,740
Speaker 1: Tonight, we review the last show to excite us in quite some time, Puella Magi Madoka Magica.

6
00:00:24,201 --> 00:00:25,218
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:29,400
Speaker 1: We're back from PAX.

8
00:00:31,523 --> 00:00:35,140
Speaker 1: You can tell that our voices are a little off, but not to like of the older days.

9
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:37,140
Speaker 1: I feel like we've leveled up the voices.

10
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:38,215
Speaker 0: Have we really?

11
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:42,030
Speaker 1: It's not like that one Otacon.

12
00:00:42,051 --> 00:00:43,180
Speaker 1: we were coughing up blood.

13
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:45,460
Speaker 1: We couldn't even talk for like a day after the con.

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:47,019
Speaker 0: You were the one who was coughing up blood.

15
00:00:47,261 --> 00:00:48,300
Speaker 1: You couldn't talk either.

16
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:50,591
Speaker 0: I was just uncomfortable to talk.

17
00:00:50,652 --> 00:00:51,699
Speaker 0: I could've talked if I needed to.

18
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:53,900
Speaker 1: You could not talk because I know you.

19
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:55,818
Speaker 1: There were some discussions that were happening at the time.

20
00:00:55,838 --> 00:00:57,310
Speaker 1: where could you have said a word?

21
00:00:57,330 --> 00:00:58,479
Speaker 1: A word would have been said.

22
00:00:59,522 --> 00:00:59,798
Speaker 0: A word.

23
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:01,151
Speaker 1: A word it is.

24
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,318
Speaker 0: So there was a real fire near my work.

25
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,068
Speaker 0: It wasn't that exciting.

26
00:01:06,089 --> 00:01:08,660
Speaker 0: Some of those garbage stores that just sell shit to tourists.

27
00:01:08,883 --> 00:01:10,220
Speaker 0: You know those, right?

28
00:01:11,143 --> 00:01:13,100
Speaker 0: They sell magnets for six bucks.

29
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,475
Speaker 1: They basically sell garbage.

30
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,539
Speaker 0: I love New York t-shirts and other trash, right?

31
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:18,500
Speaker 0: A couple of them.

32
00:01:19,364 --> 00:01:25,338
Speaker 0: From the looks of the debris because I didn't see the fire happening I just walked past it and said, "Oh, a fire happened

33
00:01:25,378 --> 00:01:25,520
Speaker 0: here.".

34
00:01:26,281 --> 00:01:32,699
Speaker 0: It looked like they had some junky old Coca-Cola beverage refrigerator that had an electrical fire of some sort.

35
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,520
Speaker 1: That's fine.

36
00:01:34,943 --> 00:01:35,769
Speaker 1: So PAX, right?

37
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,725
Speaker 1: PAX is awesome.

38
00:01:37,746 --> 00:01:38,860
Speaker 1: We'll talk about it some other time.

39
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:43,319
Speaker 1: So any of you who are new listeners from PAX, welcome, but tonight is anime night.

40
00:01:43,861 --> 00:01:44,409
Speaker 1: And comics.

41
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:45,160
Speaker 1: All that stuff.

42
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:49,560
Speaker 1: So if you're looking for our PAX coverage it'll probably be next Tuesday.

43
00:01:50,308 --> 00:01:50,556
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:53,000
Speaker 1: I will gladly pay you on Tuesday.

45
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,638
Speaker 0: For a PAX Sun.

46
00:01:55,202 --> 00:01:59,019
Speaker 1: Oh my god, the lucky thing is it's only six months till PAX.

47
00:01:59,762 --> 00:02:00,377
Speaker 0: Ah, thank god.

48
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:05,039
Speaker 0: Hopefully there will be a third PAX and there will be even less time between PAXes.

49
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:08,979
Speaker 1: So we're not going to talk about PAX tonight, but I do want to talk about the PAX-termath.

50
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:18,076
Speaker 1: Because, you know, it's a weekend, I'm in Seattle, and we pretty much do nothing but eat incredibly dense, greasy, meaty food.

51
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:22,480
Speaker 0: I kept it light by eating less meals but making all of them big.

52
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,160
Speaker 1: Which is bad, because every time I go out to eat, all I would think, I'm like an animal.

53
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:26,985
Speaker 1: I'm like, you know what?

54
00:02:27,649 --> 00:02:32,320
Speaker 1: I don't know when next there will be food in front of me, so I am going to gorge.

55
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:34,419
Speaker 0: I didn't gorge, I thought I was full.

56
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,417
Speaker 0: I didn't gorge.

57
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:41,658
Speaker 1: But that was all well and good until we were going to the airport and we got to stand in security to get back on the plane to go back to New York.

58
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:42,877
Speaker 1: Farted.

59
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,137
Speaker 1: Kept farting.

60
00:02:45,762 --> 00:02:46,500
Speaker 1: They were silent.

61
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,760
Speaker 1: To say that they were deadly was an understatement.

62
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,959
Speaker 1: I think I killed eight people.

63
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,779
Speaker 0: You were making jokes about who trailed the teams.

64
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,820
Speaker 1: This is what I'm getting to, so we're in line, right?

65
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,319
Speaker 1: And I fart.

66
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,640
Speaker 1: And Emily just looks at me, and I look at her with the look of, yeah, it was me, and she starts laughing.

67
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:09,580
Speaker 1: And then the people behind me walk into it, because the line was moving at quite a surprising pace.

68
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:15,020
Speaker 1: It was just fast enough to where I think I maximized the number of people affected by my stinking cloud.

69
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,699
Speaker 1: Maybe cloud kill at this point.

70
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:18,557
Speaker 0: Cloud kill.

71
00:03:20,104 --> 00:03:20,357
Speaker 1: Coffee!

72
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:22,086
Speaker 1: And I fart again.

73
00:03:22,308 --> 00:03:23,580
Speaker 1: We walk, and I fart again.

74
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:30,679
Speaker 1: And I can hear people down the line making the noise of oof, they go like oof as they walked into it, like it hit them in the face.

75
00:03:31,604 --> 00:03:36,580
Speaker 1: So finally, I'm like, this is very reminiscent of the Trail of Tears.

76
00:03:37,262 --> 00:03:40,198
Speaker 1: And Emily lost it, and then everyone knew it was me.

77
00:03:41,363 --> 00:03:47,899
Speaker 1: I was very proud of that, and the worst thing is because I was thinking Trail of Tears, every time I farted, I started laughing.

78
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:49,658
Speaker 1: It was like this vicious cycle.

79
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:57,738
Speaker 1: So then we go to get on the plane, and as we're walking in, I turn to Emily, and I'm like, and now, the gas chamber.

80
00:03:59,604 --> 00:04:00,799
Speaker 1: That was the worst gas I've ever had.

81
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:01,503
Speaker 0: Great.

82
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:03,831
Speaker 1: So welcome to Geek Nights, this is what we talk about.

83
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:04,278
Speaker 1: Farts.

84
00:04:05,326 --> 00:04:05,858
Speaker 0: High class.

85
00:04:08,687 --> 00:04:09,987
Speaker 0: High class, high brow.

86
00:04:10,007 --> 00:04:13,220
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, we got anime, we got manga, we got comics.

87
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:29,898
Speaker 0: So, there's a new comic that came out somewhat recently, probably between the last Wednesday show and this one, that I saw on the ordering list, and I just wanted people to be aware that now, you can order this comic on the Amazon, as Jerry Holkin says.

88
00:04:31,624 --> 00:04:35,819
Speaker 0: And it will come and be delivered to your house, where you can read it for a very low price.

89
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,139
Speaker 0: The comic is called Feynman.

90
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,708
Speaker 0: It's a biography comic.

91
00:04:39,748 --> 00:04:41,260
Speaker 1: Surely you must be joking.

92
00:04:41,863 --> 00:04:44,118
Speaker 0: Richard Feynman, the famous person.

93
00:04:45,284 --> 00:04:47,738
Speaker 0: If you don't know who that is, what the fuck?

94
00:04:49,241 --> 00:04:50,719
Speaker 0: That's pretty much all there is to it.

95
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,559
Speaker 0: Actually, you know, I saw that listed and I was like, okay, the premise on paper, that's awesome.

96
00:04:57,223 --> 00:04:59,448
Speaker 0: But in reality, I mean, is this really gonna be good?

97
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,640
Speaker 0: You know, it could be terrible.

98
00:05:01,423 --> 00:05:15,589
Speaker 0: But, I was reassured because on the Amazon, there was a little video trailer for it, which had included music and showed you frames from the comic, and actually really sold me on it.

99
00:05:15,609 --> 00:05:17,839
Speaker 0: I was like, wow, not disappointed that I ordered that.

100
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:19,698
Speaker 0: Didn't go wrong.

101
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,087
Speaker 1: Alright.

102
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,507
Speaker 0: Highly recommend.

103
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:23,479
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

104
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,587
Speaker 1: So, it was a Twitter thing, but it's comic related.

105
00:05:26,607 --> 00:05:29,440
Speaker 1: I'm gonna talk about this briefly because I just Googled it to figure out what the deal was.

106
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,269
Speaker 1: I saw a bunch of people tweeting something about the blob.

107
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:34,199
Speaker 1: ate the wasp.

108
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,698
Speaker 1: And I'm like, what, you mean like?

109
00:05:36,042 --> 00:05:37,336
Speaker 1: nothing moves the blob?

110
00:05:37,558 --> 00:05:39,320
Speaker 1: And I guess the wasp is also a superhero.

111
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:41,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, that could have been a Marvel Comics thing, right?

112
00:05:42,121 --> 00:05:45,072
Speaker 1: And it was people tweeting who know about comics.

113
00:05:45,193 --> 00:05:46,487
Speaker 1: I figured this is what they're tweeting about.

114
00:05:46,507 --> 00:05:49,295
Speaker 1: And then, one of them's like, yeah, Loeb something something.

115
00:05:49,315 --> 00:05:50,647
Speaker 1: I'm like, alright, this has got to be.

116
00:05:50,667 --> 00:05:52,020
Speaker 0: Jeff Loeb is a comic writer.

117
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:54,019
Speaker 1: So, I was like, did the blob eat the wasp?

118
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,909
Speaker 1: And who's the wasp?

119
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,780
Speaker 1: I look up and the wasp.

120
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,489
Speaker 0: The wasp is an Avenger.

121
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:57,159
Speaker 0: She's very tiny.

122
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,245
Speaker 1: And apparently, the blob ate her.

123
00:06:03,054 --> 00:06:03,579
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

124
00:06:04,122 --> 00:06:06,184
Speaker 1: And I Googled it and there it is.

125
00:06:06,871 --> 00:06:12,770
Speaker 1: Apparently famous as being one of the worst pages in any mainstream superhero comic ever.

126
00:06:13,236 --> 00:06:15,220
Speaker 0: Is she like still flying around inside of him?

127
00:06:16,304 --> 00:06:18,677
Speaker 1: No, he's like tearing her guts open and like eating her.

128
00:06:19,602 --> 00:06:19,925
Speaker 1: Yeah.

129
00:06:21,216 --> 00:06:22,004
Speaker 0: When did this happen?

130
00:06:22,024 --> 00:06:23,924
Speaker 1: There's another picture.

131
00:06:23,964 --> 00:06:28,893
Speaker 1: I don't know if this is canon or not, but it's Hank Pym eating the blob maybe in revenge.

132
00:06:29,075 --> 00:06:30,145
Speaker 1: I can't quite tell.

133
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:30,792
Speaker 1: Yeah.

134
00:06:31,135 --> 00:06:34,813
Speaker 1: I don't know what the deal is, but I had to Google it because too many people were tweeting about it.

135
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:35,360
Speaker 1: I was like, what?

136
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,004
Speaker 1: Really?

137
00:06:36,024 --> 00:06:37,079
Speaker 1: The blob?

138
00:06:38,245 --> 00:06:39,419
Speaker 1: You know, all the moves him?

139
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,963
Speaker 0: All the underwear perfect comics are just getting crazy.

140
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:42,367
Speaker 0: Go nuts.

141
00:06:42,428 --> 00:06:48,125
Speaker 0: Lately going off the deep end, like the X men have like some kind of crazy schism thing going on.

142
00:06:48,145 --> 00:06:51,297
Speaker 0: We're like uncanny X men is actually going to be a final issue.

143
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:52,025
Speaker 0: And then that's it.

144
00:06:52,713 --> 00:06:52,875
Speaker 0: Yeah.

145
00:06:53,802 --> 00:06:54,165
Speaker 1: That's it.

146
00:06:54,206 --> 00:06:55,215
Speaker 1: Just like how they all die.

147
00:06:55,316 --> 00:07:01,315
Speaker 0: And it's like, yeah, no, but like they're not going to not going to be, you know, it's uncanny X men issue, whatever, 500 something.

148
00:07:01,336 --> 00:07:03,800
Speaker 0: And then there isn't going to be whatever.

149
00:07:03,982 --> 00:07:05,153
Speaker 0: that is plus one.

150
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:06,829
Speaker 0: The unholy X men, right?

151
00:07:06,870 --> 00:07:09,602
Speaker 0: No, I mean, like, let's pretend the number is like 599.

152
00:07:09,602 --> 00:07:11,823
Speaker 0: There isn't going to be 600.

153
00:07:11,823 --> 00:07:12,227
Speaker 0: It's over.

154
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:13,924
Speaker 1: That almost doesn't mean anything.

155
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:14,429
Speaker 0: I know.

156
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:18,469
Speaker 0: And then it does, if you're some crazy collecting, you know, nut job, like they sell to.

157
00:07:18,752 --> 00:07:21,580
Speaker 0: And there's going to basically the X men, they had a big fight.

158
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,680
Speaker 0: It's like an X men fighting with themselves.

159
00:07:24,224 --> 00:07:26,269
Speaker 0: The Wolverine side and the Cyclops side.

160
00:07:26,329 --> 00:07:28,067
Speaker 0: It's like, well, Iceman's on the Wolverine side.

161
00:07:28,652 --> 00:07:29,924
Speaker 0: You know, it's that kind of bullshit.

162
00:07:29,944 --> 00:07:30,369
Speaker 0: It's like, OK.

163
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:30,712
Speaker 0: Yeah.

164
00:07:30,773 --> 00:07:31,440
Speaker 1: Well, didn't they do that?

165
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:33,539
Speaker 1: Like, didn't Captain America have some stuff like that?

166
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,609
Speaker 0: That was the Avengers.

167
00:07:34,649 --> 00:07:36,369
Speaker 0: They're basically doing the same thing with the X.

168
00:07:36,551 --> 00:07:38,894
Speaker 1: Probably because that seemed to be pretty popular.

169
00:07:38,914 --> 00:07:39,197
Speaker 1: Yeah.

170
00:07:40,143 --> 00:07:40,651
Speaker 0: I don't know.

171
00:07:40,753 --> 00:07:41,180
Speaker 0: Whatever.

172
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,147
Speaker 0: It's getting crazy.

173
00:07:42,188 --> 00:07:48,429
Speaker 0: But at least DC is doing the reset thing, which that might just be crazy and stupid, too.

174
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:50,618
Speaker 0: But we'll check it out at the end of this month.

175
00:07:51,642 --> 00:07:53,560
Speaker 0: We're going to get a holding box of comments.

176
00:07:54,103 --> 00:07:54,449
Speaker 1: Yeah.

177
00:07:54,591 --> 00:07:57,339
Speaker 1: I'm looking forward to that.

178
00:07:57,642 --> 00:07:58,188
Speaker 0: We'll see.

179
00:07:58,208 --> 00:07:59,300
Speaker 1: I kind of am a little bit.

180
00:07:59,460 --> 00:07:59,864
Speaker 0: A little bit.

181
00:08:00,127 --> 00:08:03,600
Speaker 0: Just to see its curiosity more than expectation of high quality.

182
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,540
Speaker 1: I pretty much just want all the Batman's.

183
00:08:06,386 --> 00:08:06,692
Speaker 1: Yeah.

184
00:08:06,814 --> 00:08:07,100
Speaker 1: Batman.

185
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,086
Speaker 1: Batman.

186
00:08:08,127 --> 00:08:08,329
Speaker 1: Batman.

187
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,734
Speaker 1: Batman.

188
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,807
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's Batman's is what I'm going to say from now on.

189
00:08:11,909 --> 00:08:12,419
Speaker 1: Batsmen.

190
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:17,823
Speaker 0: That's so the first.

191
00:08:17,924 --> 00:08:23,200
Speaker 0: the first one of those number ones actually just came out this morning, I guess last night at midnight.

192
00:08:23,723 --> 00:08:28,449
Speaker 0: And the Jeff Johns, who I hate, and Jim Lee, who's all right, who did the Justice League.

193
00:08:28,792 --> 00:08:32,004
Speaker 0: They were at the Midtown Comics with a huge line of people and everything.

194
00:08:32,044 --> 00:08:38,203
Speaker 1: So so I do not have a news, nor do I have a geek bite, as is often my cop out.

195
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:43,052
Speaker 1: I'm going to do something that I don't think we've said this word on the show in over a year.

196
00:08:43,073 --> 00:08:46,266
Speaker 1: I have a geek back shit.

197
00:08:46,346 --> 00:08:50,571
Speaker 1: I got an email from 12 days ago from Jarvis.

198
00:08:51,035 --> 00:08:52,044
Speaker 0: What did Jarvis say?

199
00:08:52,064 --> 00:08:52,669
Speaker 1: Jarvis said.

200
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:58,709
Speaker 1: And I bring this up partly because I've received many other emails on the same topic topic.

201
00:08:59,174 --> 00:09:05,200
Speaker 1: I don't remember saying anything about this show, but I must have because people wouldn't all be bothering us about this randomly.

202
00:09:06,081 --> 00:09:10,104
Speaker 1: So to quote Jarvis, I finished listening to the Anime We Want to See podcast.

203
00:09:10,165 --> 00:09:12,285
Speaker 1: I guess that's the one a few days ago.

204
00:09:12,305 --> 00:09:19,072
Speaker 1: I'm really hoping you guys come through with what you said about putting together a show on Gossa Rocky.

205
00:09:19,435 --> 00:09:19,960
Speaker 0: Oh, snap.

206
00:09:20,383 --> 00:09:22,629
Speaker 1: I'm not the biggest super fan of the show.

207
00:09:23,134 --> 00:09:23,599
Speaker 1: Who is?

208
00:09:24,986 --> 00:09:26,607
Speaker 1: But I did finish the whole thing.

209
00:09:26,668 --> 00:09:27,092
Speaker 1: Bravo.

210
00:09:27,133 --> 00:09:27,578
Speaker 1: Good, sir.

211
00:09:27,638 --> 00:09:28,446
Speaker 1: Good job.

212
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:32,345
Speaker 1: You win maybe two years ago and it was well worth the time.

213
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,974
Speaker 1: I even bought and built some of the model kits.

214
00:09:35,034 --> 00:09:36,261
Speaker 1: Whoa, man.

215
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:37,375
Speaker 1: They're good models, actually.

216
00:09:37,395 --> 00:09:37,760
Speaker 1: Yeah.

217
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:39,982
Speaker 0: I mean, if you get a big model stick with the Gundams do.

218
00:09:40,022 --> 00:09:40,245
Speaker 0: Yeah.

219
00:09:40,346 --> 00:09:46,042
Speaker 0: The band I put out maybe like battle textile as far out the farthest I'll go is maybe Matt Cross.

220
00:09:46,143 --> 00:09:49,153
Speaker 1: I'm not going to read the rest because he asks me a question.

221
00:09:49,193 --> 00:09:50,264
Speaker 1: that's kind of a spoiler.

222
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:52,912
Speaker 1: And it's the kind of show where I don't want to spoil this.

223
00:09:52,932 --> 00:09:53,438
Speaker 1: Right.

224
00:09:53,458 --> 00:09:56,364
Speaker 0: But for people who don't know, there's an anime called Gossa Rocky.

225
00:09:56,627 --> 00:09:57,759
Speaker 0: It's your dog.

226
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:02,183
Speaker 1: I like Gossa Rocky, but it is one of the more boring things you will ever see.

227
00:10:02,304 --> 00:10:10,910
Speaker 0: It's a really slow, boring like business and military show that has some fantasy and some robot.

228
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:11,334
Speaker 0: Yeah.

229
00:10:11,374 --> 00:10:18,466
Speaker 1: The way I would describe Gossa Rocky is imagine a world where there are mechs but the mechs are literally just tanks.

230
00:10:18,648 --> 00:10:23,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, they work just like tanks only they happen to have legs.

231
00:10:23,373 --> 00:10:30,044
Speaker 1: Simultaneously, imagine an anime that treats the way tanks work the way tanks work.

232
00:10:30,489 --> 00:10:38,147
Speaker 1: And the people driving the tanks are talking the way that real people who are driving tanks are going to talk to each other and there's no time compression.

233
00:10:38,207 --> 00:10:39,479
Speaker 0: Or at least convincingly so.

234
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, in the ineffect that it's just like move four clicks to the north.

235
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,508
Speaker 1: Affirmative that.

236
00:10:44,670 --> 00:10:45,947
Speaker 1: Moving four clicks to the north.

237
00:10:46,028 --> 00:10:46,272
Speaker 1: Click.

238
00:10:46,537 --> 00:10:46,720
Speaker 1: Click.

239
00:10:48,971 --> 00:10:50,187
Speaker 1: We are engaging hostiles.

240
00:10:50,207 --> 00:10:50,491
Speaker 1: It's just.

241
00:10:51,725 --> 00:10:52,735
Speaker 1: it is so boring.

242
00:10:52,856 --> 00:10:54,229
Speaker 1: I cannot express this to you.

243
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:54,875
Speaker 0: But I like it.

244
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:55,724
Speaker 0: It's a good show.

245
00:10:55,784 --> 00:11:02,936
Speaker 1: I really like it anyway because it's boring and procedural but it's a show that builds and builds.

246
00:11:03,077 --> 00:11:07,199
Speaker 1: Basically the entire show is set up for three scenes at the end of the show.

247
00:11:08,222 --> 00:11:08,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

248
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,704
Speaker 1: And you'll know if you like this show.

249
00:11:11,785 --> 00:11:20,491
Speaker 1: I highly recommend at least watching it until something happens where a mech is hanging on a wire out the back of a plane shooting its stuff.

250
00:11:20,592 --> 00:11:21,300
Speaker 0: That was a great scene.

251
00:11:21,826 --> 00:11:24,137
Speaker 1: Or when a dude gets backed over by a jeep.

252
00:11:25,587 --> 00:11:31,745
Speaker 1: Those two scenes, if you notice those scenes and you enjoy them, you should watch the entire show.

253
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:40,190
Speaker 1: Now it also has an ancient mystery and it also has the cliche that we've been talking about a lot lately because both Madoka and Trigun had this.

254
00:11:40,756 --> 00:11:42,997
Speaker 1: An episode that we like to call "Suddenly in

255
00:11:43,058 --> 00:11:43,300
Speaker 1: Space."

256
00:11:43,941 --> 00:11:52,127
Speaker 1: Meaning you turn on the episode, you know like somewhere in the middle of the show and you stop it a few minutes in because you think you've got the wrong show.

257
00:11:52,612 --> 00:11:54,007
Speaker 1: Like you opened the wrong file.

258
00:11:54,128 --> 00:11:55,564
Speaker 1: Maybe the DVD's messed up.

259
00:11:56,373 --> 00:12:05,358
Speaker 1: Kind of like in "Innocence" where I was in the theater and I was convinced that the digital copy they were showing us was messed up and was looping.

260
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:07,279
Speaker 1: And then I was like "Oh no, it's just

261
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,054
Speaker 1: Oshii.".

262
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:11,040
Speaker 1: Now, I keep saying boring.

263
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,714
Speaker 1: You gotta trust me guys.

264
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:13,603
Speaker 1: You might like this show.

265
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:14,753
Speaker 1: It's super good.

266
00:12:14,996 --> 00:12:15,440
Speaker 1: Way good.

267
00:12:16,691 --> 00:12:18,349
Speaker 1: But, let's see what's a good example?

268
00:12:18,369 --> 00:12:21,702
Speaker 0: The thing is it's way good for the people who like it.

269
00:12:21,763 --> 00:12:24,065
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people who won't like it.

270
00:12:24,085 --> 00:12:24,409
Speaker 0: Most people.

271
00:12:24,429 --> 00:12:28,900
Speaker 1: Like if you like say "Skycrawlers" like the slow Oshii style.

272
00:12:29,121 --> 00:12:39,945
Speaker 1: you know, it's slow and boring because that's part of the message and you're cool with an hour and forty minutes of very little happening punctuated by action scenes, you're gonna dig this.

273
00:12:40,713 --> 00:12:42,572
Speaker 1: It's got a similar kind of message too.

274
00:12:42,652 --> 00:12:43,663
Speaker 1: It's even gotta be shown in it.

275
00:12:43,744 --> 00:12:45,300
Speaker 0: Remember him?

276
00:12:45,461 --> 00:12:45,885
Speaker 0: I guess.

277
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:46,269
Speaker 0: Yeah.

278
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:47,966
Speaker 1: He pretty much is.

279
00:12:47,986 --> 00:12:49,260
Speaker 0: He's got a good mystery.

280
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,329
Speaker 0: We actually watched the show.

281
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,805
Speaker 0: I bought the whole show on VHS.

282
00:12:51,825 --> 00:12:53,439
Speaker 0: We watched it all dubbed a long time ago.

283
00:12:54,062 --> 00:12:55,865
Speaker 0: We don't have VCRs anymore really.

284
00:12:55,885 --> 00:13:02,920
Speaker 1: The dub averages out to a C but that's basically a B dub with one line that brought it down to a C average.

285
00:13:03,542 --> 00:13:05,180
Speaker 1: That's the worst line in any anime ever.

286
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:08,559
Speaker 0: I bought the dub on VHS because it was cheaper in those days.

287
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,818
Speaker 0: I didn't have a DVD player in those days.

288
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:15,826
Speaker 0: Now you can get it on DVD probably cheap but I don't think it's in print anymore.

289
00:13:15,846 --> 00:13:16,839
Speaker 0: so you're gonna have to dig it up.

290
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:19,906
Speaker 1: The main reason I say to watch it, I guess it's turned into a geek bite now.

291
00:13:19,926 --> 00:13:21,360
Speaker 1: I did a geek back that turned into a geek bite.

292
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:22,439
Speaker 1: Like what happens here.

293
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,067
Speaker 0: Double power.

294
00:13:24,168 --> 00:13:28,429
Speaker 1: We're really like it's anime season again so there's gonna be a lot of anime reviews coming down the pipe.

295
00:13:28,854 --> 00:13:32,631
Speaker 1: So I'm just gonna tell you right now to watch Gasaraki and then we'll watch it at some point soon.

296
00:13:33,035 --> 00:13:34,611
Speaker 1: We'll probably do a show or two on it.

297
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:35,500
Speaker 0: Probably.

298
00:13:36,321 --> 00:13:37,359
Speaker 1: Because lately it's anime.

299
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,405
Speaker 1: Maybe it's because PAX is done and all the games I want to play that I saw at PAX I cannot play yet.

300
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:48,119
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna watch anime until Aramac and Monaco and Spy Party are in my house.

301
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,504
Speaker 1: And then I'm pretty much gonna play those games.

302
00:13:51,848 --> 00:13:52,172
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

303
00:13:52,233 --> 00:13:52,759
Speaker 0: Counter Strike Go.

304
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:53,525
Speaker 1: Yup yup.

305
00:13:53,912 --> 00:13:54,420
Speaker 0: Tribes Ascend.

306
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:59,547
Speaker 1: The best part is I traded a pretty crap ass board game for a box set.

307
00:13:59,608 --> 00:14:01,949
Speaker 0: You traded the number one board game on BoardGameGeek.

308
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:05,280
Speaker 1: Yeah you know what the number one board game on BoardGameGeek kinda sucks.

309
00:14:06,649 --> 00:14:08,090
Speaker 0: For like 75, 80 bucks you paid for it.

310
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,888
Speaker 1: That was one of the biggest mistakes I ever made was buying that game.

311
00:14:11,908 --> 00:14:13,887
Speaker 0: You realize the price of it now is like 100 plus.

312
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:14,917
Speaker 1: Don't even care.

313
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:15,584
Speaker 1: I just don't want it.

314
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:16,900
Speaker 0: And you traded it for an anime.

315
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,968
Speaker 0: you probably could have got used for a lot less.

316
00:14:20,453 --> 00:14:22,613
Speaker 1: I just wanted to get rid of Twilight Struggle.

317
00:14:22,674 --> 00:14:23,300
Speaker 1: Fuck that game.

318
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,160
Speaker 1: And dude who got it from me you're gonna play it and you're gonna be like oh.

319
00:14:28,363 --> 00:14:29,136
Speaker 0: Maybe he'll like it.

320
00:14:29,562 --> 00:14:29,967
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

321
00:14:29,987 --> 00:14:31,019
Speaker 0: Apparently a lot of people do.

322
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,458
Speaker 1: I know but who are these people?

323
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,071
Speaker 0: It's not a good game.

324
00:14:34,132 --> 00:14:34,459
Speaker 0: Balls guys.

325
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,630
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

326
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:45,884
Speaker 1: Usually Scott sees things like this before I do.

327
00:14:45,985 --> 00:14:47,701
Speaker 1: Somehow I saw this one first.

328
00:14:48,306 --> 00:14:48,892
Speaker 0: We really like it.

329
00:14:48,912 --> 00:14:50,490
Speaker 0: You were just having to read more internets today.

330
00:14:50,670 --> 00:14:59,377
Speaker 1: We really like it when people make stylized posters in an old style or a neat style about something that is not traditionally in that style.

331
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:03,176
Speaker 1: I think the poster child for this is that awesome X-Men poster.

332
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:03,883
Speaker 0: Yup.

333
00:15:04,328 --> 00:15:08,755
Speaker 1: So this is that and it's also kind of like those posters.

334
00:15:08,816 --> 00:15:10,390
Speaker 0: See the thing I don't understand right.

335
00:15:10,390 --> 00:15:12,090
Speaker 0: You always see this style of poster.

336
00:15:12,310 --> 00:15:18,589
Speaker 0: Why doesn't anyone use this style for like a video game or a whole movie or something like that.

337
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,058
Speaker 1: Why don't we make turn flicked in this style.

338
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:21,686
Speaker 0: Let's do it.

339
00:15:21,767 --> 00:15:21,990
Speaker 0: Done.

340
00:15:22,797 --> 00:15:23,123
Speaker 0: Done.

341
00:15:23,184 --> 00:15:23,490
Speaker 0: Yeah.

342
00:15:24,533 --> 00:15:25,198
Speaker 0: Good job.

343
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:26,570
Speaker 1: Now we have to make turn flicked.

344
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:27,841
Speaker 0: We're working on it.

345
00:15:27,882 --> 00:15:29,986
Speaker 1: I haven't worked on it in like three months.

346
00:15:30,188 --> 00:15:30,673
Speaker 0: That's alright.

347
00:15:31,441 --> 00:15:32,512
Speaker 1: In fact I still have it's.

348
00:15:32,573 --> 00:15:38,633
Speaker 1: on my desk is a piece of paper where I sketched out four maps and I wrote down the numbers for five kinds of units.

349
00:15:39,198 --> 00:15:40,977
Speaker 1: I have not even typed that into a computer yet.

350
00:15:40,997 --> 00:15:41,584
Speaker 0: Yeah it's fine.

351
00:15:41,887 --> 00:15:48,188
Speaker 1: Anyway so these are travel posters for historic planet Zeebs.

352
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:50,688
Speaker 0: Let's travel to planet Zeebs.

353
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,497
Speaker 1: They're pretty great.

354
00:15:51,517 --> 00:15:52,490
Speaker 0: What a great place to visit.

355
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:53,176
Speaker 0: You know what.

356
00:15:53,297 --> 00:15:53,662
Speaker 1: You know what.

357
00:15:53,702 --> 00:15:56,110
Speaker 0: Tons of horrible creatures that want to rip your face off.

358
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:59,279
Speaker 1: I point out this might be horrible acid everywhere.

359
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:06,713
Speaker 1: Maybe this is from an era before the planet sucked because I mean the Chozo were there was kind of awesome wasn't it?

360
00:16:06,734 --> 00:16:08,389
Speaker 0: Oh did you want to go there when the Chozo were still there?

361
00:16:08,651 --> 00:16:09,217
Speaker 1: Or maybe.

362
00:16:09,521 --> 00:16:10,633
Speaker 1: Maybe like the Chozo fell.

363
00:16:10,714 --> 00:16:13,238
Speaker 1: Maybe it was nice for a while and then eventually it went to shit.

364
00:16:13,601 --> 00:16:15,682
Speaker 1: Maybe the space pirates made it go to shit.

365
00:16:16,067 --> 00:16:19,062
Speaker 1: Maybe after Sam has fixed everything it's nice again.

366
00:16:19,143 --> 00:16:19,528
Speaker 1: We don't know.

367
00:16:20,715 --> 00:16:23,590
Speaker 1: I mean it was kind of empty when Sam has went back in Super Metroid.

368
00:16:24,593 --> 00:16:26,878
Speaker 0: Except for these space pirates living there.

369
00:16:26,898 --> 00:16:27,826
Speaker 1: Just space pirates.

370
00:16:27,867 --> 00:16:29,842
Speaker 1: There weren't that much else going on.

371
00:16:29,943 --> 00:16:30,809
Speaker 0: Metroids.

372
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:35,218
Speaker 0: Horribly dangerous flora and fauna.

373
00:16:35,259 --> 00:16:35,949
Speaker 1: Not that bad.

374
00:16:37,251 --> 00:16:41,688
Speaker 0: It doesn't get much more dangerous in terms of the flora and fauna danger department.

375
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:49,134
Speaker 1: I guess my perspective is skewed because every time I visited it has been through the most badass woman to have ever not lived.

376
00:16:49,517 --> 00:16:52,309
Speaker 0: You've never visited the West Indies.

377
00:16:53,571 --> 00:16:55,649
Speaker 1: You've never been to the West Indies.

378
00:16:57,492 --> 00:16:59,943
Speaker 1: Kids you win a point if you know what we're referencing there.

379
00:16:59,963 --> 00:17:01,317
Speaker 1: So what do you got for me Scott?

380
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,021
Speaker 0: Why don't we do a show on the thing you were referencing on a Thursday?

381
00:17:04,467 --> 00:17:05,903
Speaker 1: We had to have done a show on that.

382
00:17:05,964 --> 00:17:06,470
Speaker 0: We'll check it.

383
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:07,863
Speaker 1: I will check while you do your thing of the day.

384
00:17:07,883 --> 00:17:08,510
Speaker 0: You'll have to rewatch.

385
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:09,134
Speaker 0: Don't you have it?

386
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,002
Speaker 1: Yes.

387
00:17:10,124 --> 00:17:13,680
Speaker 1: I have two DVD box sets of the thing to which we referred a moment ago.

388
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:17,881
Speaker 0: If you haven't done the show, let's watch an episode after the show is done.

389
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:18,285
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

390
00:17:18,346 --> 00:17:19,598
Speaker 1: And then you want to drink some laudanum?

391
00:17:19,902 --> 00:17:20,084
Speaker 1: No.

392
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:20,650
Speaker 1: You have a party?

393
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:21,564
Speaker 1: Maudanum party?

394
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:21,748
Speaker 0: No.

395
00:17:23,450 --> 00:17:24,369
Speaker 0: Thing of the day, right?

396
00:17:24,951 --> 00:17:32,324
Speaker 0: So for those of you who are aware Hatsune Miku was made using a technology known as Vocaloid 2.

397
00:17:32,324 --> 00:17:36,544
Speaker 0: And Hatsune Miku sounds pretty good depending on the person orchestrating her.

398
00:17:36,626 --> 00:17:37,588
Speaker 0: I guess would be the verb.

399
00:17:38,911 --> 00:17:40,550
Speaker 1: That sounds a little bit kinky.

400
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:42,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, depending on how much...

401
00:17:43,690 --> 00:17:47,894
Speaker 1: Scott, we did a show on this on June 7th, 2007.

402
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:48,138
Speaker 0: Shit.

403
00:17:48,645 --> 00:17:49,334
Speaker 0: Here's the news.

404
00:17:50,022 --> 00:17:51,315
Speaker 1: You did something from Fark.

405
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:51,820
Speaker 1: I don't know what.

406
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,729
Speaker 1: I'm going to click on it now.

407
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:53,332
Speaker 1: Alright.

408
00:17:53,575 --> 00:17:55,889
Speaker 1: And I said that fidgeting is good for people.

409
00:17:57,033 --> 00:17:58,470
Speaker 1: Your thing of the day was the Jill Jet.

410
00:17:59,419 --> 00:17:59,708
Speaker 0: Jill Jet.

411
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:05,788
Speaker 1: And my thing of the day was Chairbot, which is basically hedonism bot the cosplay.

412
00:18:06,830 --> 00:18:08,290
Speaker 0: Alright, so what was my news from Fark?

413
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:12,008
Speaker 1: Your news was something from the Daily Mail that no longer exists.

414
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:12,814
Speaker 1: Great.

415
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,108
Speaker 1: Nope, that's mine about fidgeting.

416
00:18:14,810 --> 00:18:19,889
Speaker 1: Yours was a man was in a wheelchair and got hit by a semi truck.

417
00:18:20,430 --> 00:18:20,714
Speaker 0: What?

418
00:18:20,816 --> 00:18:21,628
Speaker 0: That was your news.

419
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:22,411
Speaker 0: What?

420
00:18:22,452 --> 00:18:23,767
Speaker 0: There had to be something more to it.

421
00:18:25,534 --> 00:18:26,610
Speaker 0: Hot to go listen to this episode.

422
00:18:27,290 --> 00:18:29,197
Speaker 1: I'm loading this old news article.

423
00:18:29,803 --> 00:18:32,910
Speaker 1: Oh, a man was hit by a truck in his wheelchair.

424
00:18:33,576 --> 00:18:35,461
Speaker 1: It did not kill him or hurt him in any way.

425
00:18:35,482 --> 00:18:42,169
Speaker 1: The truck pushed him for two miles at over 50 miles an hour.

426
00:18:42,913 --> 00:18:43,241
Speaker 1: Okay, okay.

427
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:50,209
Speaker 0: Alright, so Hatsune Miku has made a Vocaloid too.

428
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,688
Speaker 1: You know what town this happened in?

429
00:18:52,590 --> 00:18:52,860
Speaker 1: Pawpaw.

430
00:18:54,767 --> 00:19:02,725
Speaker 0: So, Hatsune Miku has made a Vocaloid too and depending on who, you know, if some amateur just opens up Hatsune Miku and tries to make her sing it sounds like a robot.

431
00:19:02,806 --> 00:19:05,249
Speaker 0: But if a professional does it and spends a lot of time on it.

432
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:08,141
Speaker 0: it can often sound very close to a real person.

433
00:19:08,667 --> 00:19:12,930
Speaker 0: But even if you listen closely you can tell that it's not a real person.

434
00:19:13,593 --> 00:19:16,649
Speaker 0: At best, it's a person with extremely heavy autotune, right?

435
00:19:17,371 --> 00:19:27,540
Speaker 0: There has been a leaked audio file from someone who in Korea, they're working on a different company not Krypton Future Media who makes Hatsune Miku.

436
00:19:27,601 --> 00:19:34,671
Speaker 0: But this other company in Korea is making a new voice using Vocaloid 3.

437
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:35,599
Speaker 0: Oh shit son.

438
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:43,377
Speaker 0: And this leaked audio was put on the internets and it sounds like a person with a very light autotune.

439
00:19:43,437 --> 00:19:44,629
Speaker 1: The next step after this.

440
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,690
Speaker 0: This is still in development, first of all.

441
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:51,842
Speaker 0: And second of all, if that did they put the full effort of a professional into it?

442
00:19:51,863 --> 00:20:00,788
Speaker 0: Like if the best Vocaloid users on earth use this, it's probably going to sound like a person with very very little autotunes on them.

443
00:20:02,071 --> 00:20:04,910
Speaker 1: Vocaloid 4 is one step away from Super Matt Cross.

444
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:11,961
Speaker 0: Vocaloid 4 is probably going to be in the uncanny valley deep into it and Vocaloid 5 is probably going to sound like a real person.

445
00:20:11,982 --> 00:20:14,105
Speaker 0: So I predict, what year is it?

446
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:14,690
Speaker 0: 2011? 2012?

447
00:20:14,690 --> 00:20:16,651
Speaker 0: So 2022?

448
00:20:16,651 --> 00:20:17,339
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

449
00:20:17,339 --> 00:20:19,210
Speaker 1: 2011? 2012?

450
00:20:19,210 --> 00:20:19,291
Speaker 1: Yeah.

451
00:20:19,332 --> 00:20:19,900
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

452
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,418
Speaker 1: you have to estimate what year it is?

453
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:22,870
Speaker 0: It's pretty close to 2012.

454
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:23,516
Speaker 1: It's August!

455
00:20:24,304 --> 00:20:39,522
Speaker 0: Right, so in 2021 or 2028 you're probably going to have Vocaloid 5 and Vocaloid 5 is going to sound like a real person and you won't be able to tell.

456
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:41,769
Speaker 1: Vocaloid 6 is going to take over the world.

457
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:44,769
Speaker 0: Vocaloid 6, you won't have to even type anything in.

458
00:20:45,112 --> 00:20:46,183
Speaker 0: it'll just sing songs.

459
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:46,647
Speaker 0: You turn it on.

460
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,224
Speaker 0: But yeah this is pretty impressive.

461
00:20:50,264 --> 00:20:51,254
Speaker 0: You should listen to this.

462
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,009
Speaker 0: This is not a person singing every last.

463
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:57,233
Speaker 0: what was it?

464
00:20:57,516 --> 00:21:01,860
Speaker 0: We will not have a vocal cord left in the singing of these internal machines.

465
00:21:02,406 --> 00:21:08,426
Speaker 1: So for a while now I've known about the show Puella Magi, Madoka, Magica you know, the weird title.

466
00:21:08,446 --> 00:21:09,597
Speaker 1: I always just called it Puella.

467
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:20,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you know it's one of those situations where you're on the internets and you know sometimes there's like a thread that explodes about something and it's like you just notice it and you're like wow there's a pony thread over there.

468
00:21:20,951 --> 00:21:23,235
Speaker 0: I guess there's a thing called ponies and it's pretty popular.

469
00:21:23,275 --> 00:21:24,306
Speaker 0: Let me go see what the deal is.

470
00:21:24,327 --> 00:21:30,627
Speaker 0: So there was a Madoka Magica thread and I knew that there was a relatively new anime called Madoka Magica.

471
00:21:30,647 --> 00:21:36,042
Speaker 0: I didn't know anything else about it other than it was magical girly and it was getting and the people were talking about it.

472
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:36,748
Speaker 0: so I was like yeah.

473
00:21:36,769 --> 00:21:40,369
Speaker 1: I had a little more going for me ahead of time because one, I knew it was done by Shaft.

474
00:21:40,955 --> 00:21:41,178
Speaker 0: All right.

475
00:21:41,622 --> 00:21:43,969
Speaker 1: You know they did Wreck which we also kind of liked.

476
00:21:45,412 --> 00:21:48,450
Speaker 1: And Arakawa under the Bridgie and Arakawa under the Bridgie-Bridgie.

477
00:21:48,530 --> 00:21:49,400
Speaker 0: You love the Bridgie-Bridgie.

478
00:21:49,562 --> 00:21:50,290
Speaker 1: I do love the Bridgie-Bridgie.

479
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:50,916
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

480
00:21:51,259 --> 00:22:03,741
Speaker 1: But also Nate had been telling me forever like from the moment it was out he was like this show is up your alley and the way he sold it to me was he was like it's Utena Eva with music by Yuki Kajira.

481
00:22:03,903 --> 00:22:06,469
Speaker 0: Yeah so I asked Emily, I was like what's the deal with that show?

482
00:22:06,489 --> 00:22:06,913
Speaker 0: and she's like.

483
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:11,640
Speaker 0: it's like magical girls but it's serious and dark and I was like all right whatever.

484
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,609
Speaker 0: so I started watching it.

485
00:22:13,115 --> 00:22:16,669
Speaker 0: you know people and I I realized what made me watch it.

486
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:18,330
Speaker 0: you know people talked about it.

487
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:19,924
Speaker 0: I needed a show to watch.

488
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:20,609
Speaker 0: I checked it out.

489
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:22,306
Speaker 0: it was only 12 episodes.

490
00:22:22,467 --> 00:22:25,155
Speaker 0: I'm like oh even if this is awful I can watch 12 episodes.

491
00:22:25,176 --> 00:22:26,349
Speaker 1: That's like two afternoons.

492
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:30,270
Speaker 0: Right and I need to do a geek night show about something on a Wednesday.

493
00:22:30,810 --> 00:22:37,075
Speaker 1: Now it is very telling Scott that usually when there's a new show like this that isn't a million episodes you'll start watching it.

494
00:22:37,115 --> 00:22:42,449
Speaker 1: you'll say like hey I'm watching X and then like a month later you'll be like yeah I finished it you should watch it you should be doing a show on it.

495
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,176
Speaker 1: You came to me like right away you're like watch this god damn show.

496
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:58,490
Speaker 0: Yeah well as soon as I started watching it on a night and I watched five episodes and then the next day I watched seven and by noon I had watched the whole show because it's 12 episodes.

497
00:22:58,830 --> 00:23:01,783
Speaker 1: It's been a long time since Scott's been excited about an anime.

498
00:23:02,308 --> 00:23:09,689
Speaker 1: Never mind it's been a long time since I've been excited enough about anime to where I start watching it and I can't stop.

499
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,641
Speaker 0: That happens sometimes.

500
00:23:11,661 --> 00:23:17,408
Speaker 1: I mean the last show that did that to me that wasn't My Little Pony was watching Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex.

501
00:23:18,191 --> 00:23:19,764
Speaker 0: So I did it somewhat recently.

502
00:23:19,784 --> 00:23:20,369
Speaker 1: Bocorato did it to me.

503
00:23:21,252 --> 00:23:23,817
Speaker 1: Eva, Eska, Trigun, Bebop.

504
00:23:23,918 --> 00:23:25,701
Speaker 0: And trying to think of times I couldn't stop.

505
00:23:25,741 --> 00:23:28,430
Speaker 0: I mean there'd be times like watching Okotenu Ken.

506
00:23:28,732 --> 00:23:34,306
Speaker 0: right so you just keep watching but there's a zillion episodes so you only watch like five at a time or something like that.

507
00:23:34,366 --> 00:23:37,134
Speaker 0: You know you don't just keep going and going without stopping because you can't.

508
00:23:37,174 --> 00:23:37,578
Speaker 0: You'll die.

509
00:23:37,598 --> 00:23:42,446
Speaker 1: Yeah but some shows like Bebop, if you've never seen it before you've just got to see the next episode.

510
00:23:42,466 --> 00:23:46,710
Speaker 0: Yeah even if you've seen Kawi Bebop before you start watching, you just can't stop watching.

511
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:47,609
Speaker 0: You go straight to the end.

512
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:50,265
Speaker 0: So what is Madoka Magica?

513
00:23:50,305 --> 00:23:50,959
Speaker 0: So here's the deal.

514
00:23:52,772 --> 00:23:55,154
Speaker 0: There's magical girls in the real world.

515
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:58,506
Speaker 0: It's sort of actually a futuristic world right?

516
00:23:58,607 --> 00:23:59,497
Speaker 0: It's like everything.

517
00:23:59,578 --> 00:24:02,910
Speaker 1: Yeah I think 20, 40 years into our future pretty realistically.

518
00:24:03,290 --> 00:24:07,174
Speaker 0: Everything is somewhat higher tech than the things we have in the world today.

519
00:24:07,275 --> 00:24:07,942
Speaker 1: I kind of like that.

520
00:24:07,983 --> 00:24:08,589
Speaker 1: It was a nice touch.

521
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:09,559
Speaker 1: Yeah.

522
00:24:09,784 --> 00:24:18,042
Speaker 0: So you know this girl is in school and her name is Madoka and one day this transfer student shows up at the school.

523
00:24:18,062 --> 00:24:20,849
Speaker 1: Wow this is pretty stereotypical sounding so far isn't it?

524
00:24:21,071 --> 00:24:23,860
Speaker 0: She runs out of her house to go to school with a piece of toast in her mouth.

525
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,365
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

526
00:24:24,425 --> 00:24:25,739
Speaker 1: but she finishes the toast.

527
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:26,790
Speaker 1: I've never seen that happen.

528
00:24:27,091 --> 00:24:27,799
Speaker 0: Yeah she ate the whole toast.

529
00:24:27,819 --> 00:24:32,567
Speaker 1: Usually the toast is it causes like a gravitational field that causes a boy to be in front of her.

530
00:24:32,607 --> 00:24:34,125
Speaker 1: They'll bump into each other and it goes flying.

531
00:24:34,327 --> 00:24:34,510
Speaker 0: Right.

532
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:35,981
Speaker 0: You know and it's typical.

533
00:24:36,143 --> 00:24:38,165
Speaker 0: you know at least on the surface level.

534
00:24:38,427 --> 00:24:40,387
Speaker 0: you know high school magical girl stuff.

535
00:24:40,487 --> 00:24:56,245
Speaker 0: but at the very beginning of the show the opening scene is that typical anime trick where they show you some crazy action scene of something else and then after the opener it's happy school and they somehow tie in that thing.

536
00:24:56,285 --> 00:25:01,721
Speaker 0: that happened before the opener of the first episode is like a glimpse of the real plot later.

537
00:25:01,843 --> 00:25:03,249
Speaker 1: Well like remember When They Cry?

538
00:25:04,932 --> 00:25:05,962
Speaker 0: I didn't really watch it.

539
00:25:06,043 --> 00:25:12,365
Speaker 1: Before the credits it was the savage beating to death of someone with a baseball bat and then it was Moe School for like 23 minutes.

540
00:25:15,031 --> 00:25:15,699
Speaker 0: So it's you know.

541
00:25:16,144 --> 00:25:17,780
Speaker 0: and that's the thing about Madoka I don't want.

542
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:18,910
Speaker 0: you know it's only 12 episodes.

543
00:25:19,234 --> 00:25:21,619
Speaker 0: you can pretty much spoil the whole thing by saying anything.

544
00:25:21,639 --> 00:25:22,448
Speaker 1: Well but here's the deal.

545
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:24,387
Speaker 1: so Madoka she's cute girl typical.

546
00:25:24,427 --> 00:25:25,296
Speaker 1: everything's stereotypical.

547
00:25:25,619 --> 00:25:30,830
Speaker 1: the transfer student all mysterious and badass and she takes her aside.

548
00:25:30,951 --> 00:25:42,147
Speaker 1: and actually Homura the transfer student has a lot of really good lines in this show like she has good delivery of things in it but she kind of takes Madoka aside.

549
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,070
Speaker 1: she's like I need you to show me to the nurses office.

550
00:25:44,892 --> 00:25:46,629
Speaker 1: and she's like do you value your life?

551
00:25:46,872 --> 00:25:55,278
Speaker 1: do you value the things in your life and she's like yes and then Homura's like well then you don't need to be anyone else do you?

552
00:25:55,584 --> 00:25:55,829
Speaker 0: Yeah.

553
00:25:57,153 --> 00:26:01,576
Speaker 0: She's obviously from the start being like look you know that it's a magical girl show.

554
00:26:01,637 --> 00:26:02,929
Speaker 0: Madoka's name is in the show.

555
00:26:03,333 --> 00:26:06,829
Speaker 0: you see her as a magical girl in the opener which isn't anything like the show at all.

556
00:26:07,415 --> 00:26:07,960
Speaker 0: you know that.

557
00:26:08,081 --> 00:26:08,364
Speaker 0: you know.

558
00:26:08,586 --> 00:26:18,225
Speaker 0: you're thinking she's gonna become a magical girl and the first thing that happens is this mysterious girl who was magical in the opening before the opener.

559
00:26:18,347 --> 00:26:22,915
Speaker 0: right who's now the transfer student is like don't become a magical girl.

560
00:26:23,178 --> 00:26:28,470
Speaker 1: pretty much yep especially because in the opener once like Madoka is clearly a magical girl.

561
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:31,628
Speaker 0: so within the first couple minutes they've set up the conflict already.

562
00:26:32,672 --> 00:26:35,684
Speaker 0: Madoka had a dream about this magical girl.

563
00:26:35,704 --> 00:26:42,488
Speaker 0: the girl who looks just like the magical girl appears at school as a transfer student and it tells Madoka not to become a magical girl.

564
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:45,644
Speaker 0: and pretty much you know she's the main character.

565
00:26:45,664 --> 00:26:46,916
Speaker 0: so she's got to become one.

566
00:26:47,239 --> 00:26:55,741
Speaker 1: and right after that I mean things conspire and there's this cute mascot Q-Bay who's kind of like Luna and Dung Beetle and all those cute things kind of mixed together into one.

567
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:57,803
Speaker 0: yeah he's the same thing as Dung Beetle from Bocorano.

568
00:26:57,823 --> 00:27:00,166
Speaker 0: basically he's the alien who tries to.

569
00:27:00,226 --> 00:27:01,984
Speaker 0: you know has it's like?

570
00:27:02,025 --> 00:27:03,560
Speaker 0: there's all these different sorts of.

571
00:27:03,721 --> 00:27:07,541
Speaker 0: you know Madoka's combined all these different things right.

572
00:27:07,642 --> 00:27:12,529
Speaker 0: a lot of the show has the mood of Eva right where you know you'll have shots of.

573
00:27:12,711 --> 00:27:18,858
Speaker 0: you know weird things or like shots where the characters are off camera while sort of an eerie music plays and people talk.

574
00:27:19,384 --> 00:27:25,441
Speaker 0: or you know a quiet scene of an empty street with cicadas chirping right a lot of the Eva kind of stuff and the same.

575
00:27:25,562 --> 00:27:27,706
Speaker 0: and that's the mood you'll have through a lot of the show.

576
00:27:27,747 --> 00:27:34,610
Speaker 1: but like the backgrounds and the like the stark silhouette landscapes are so utenna it's ridiculous.

577
00:27:34,731 --> 00:27:46,970
Speaker 0: yeah also you'll have you know how Battle Royale or Bocorano or a lot of those or Nine People Nine Doors Nine Hours whatever Death Note, Monster even Death Note, Monster not really.

578
00:27:47,574 --> 00:27:54,518
Speaker 0: but you know all these shows that have a premise where all the conflict Bocorano centers around a set of rules like they set up.

579
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,194
Speaker 0: you know in some sci-fi or fantasy reason for a set of rules like these are the rules of the Death Note.

580
00:28:00,215 --> 00:28:07,305
Speaker 0: this is the rules of the Battle Royale while Madoka there's these set of rules about magical girls that are set up that create conflict because

581
00:28:07,365 --> 00:28:17,549
Speaker 1: if you pull back a little bit there aren't that many rules that come into play in this show and they're very rarely stated as like in Death Note like rule number eight blah blah blah.

582
00:28:17,671 --> 00:28:20,597
Speaker 0: they're not stated so strictly like they are in the other rules shows.

583
00:28:20,638 --> 00:28:32,254
Speaker 1: it's more that the mystery of the show is what the rules are or like in Monster the mystery is kind of like what is the monster after and what made him and why is he doing this to all those kids?

584
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:36,335
Speaker 0: yeah and also right the show also has the Trigun going on.

585
00:28:36,376 --> 00:28:42,175
Speaker 0: if you don't if you've never seen Trigun I'm not going to spoil that either but it's also a Gasaraki same show does the same thing we call it now.

586
00:28:42,256 --> 00:28:45,448
Speaker 1: I think Scott coined the term suddenly in space right.

587
00:28:45,731 --> 00:28:52,096
Speaker 0: so in Trigun episode 17 I'm not going to tell you what happens but basically suddenly right.

588
00:28:52,136 --> 00:28:52,741
Speaker 0: the episode 16 ends.

589
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:56,579
Speaker 0: episode 17 does not pick up where 16 left off.

590
00:28:57,551 --> 00:29:03,650
Speaker 0: in fact you might think did I put in the wrong DVD right because it doesn't look like Trigun even though you just saw a Trigun opener?

591
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:05,730
Speaker 1: uh Gasaraki did the same thing episode.

592
00:29:05,892 --> 00:29:08,890
Speaker 1: I think it's 12 or 13. it's like what this isn't Gasaraki?

593
00:29:09,713 --> 00:29:10,542
Speaker 1: did they fuck up.

594
00:29:10,744 --> 00:29:12,036
Speaker 0: but it is you know they.

595
00:29:12,077 --> 00:29:14,803
Speaker 0: just suddenly there's an episode at the very beginning of the episode.

596
00:29:14,823 --> 00:29:17,149
Speaker 0: you're in the past and you're seeing.

597
00:29:17,553 --> 00:29:24,016
Speaker 0: you're basically having the secrets of the show answered for you and episode 10 out of 12 of Madoka is just like that.

598
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:32,722
Speaker 0: it doesn't pick up where 9 left off it just starts at some other point in some other place and teaches you all the secrets of the show and blows your brains out.

599
00:29:32,743 --> 00:29:41,671
Speaker 1: now very rarely if I had an episode of it I've had shows that have oh shit moments where like oh shit Akio something oh shit you know some sort of like.

600
00:29:42,015 --> 00:29:46,036
Speaker 0: yeah but the thing is those more typically right come towards the end of an episode.

601
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:53,128
Speaker 0: it's like an episode will pick up where the last one went off build up and then something crazy will happen at some sort of climax.

602
00:29:53,168 --> 00:29:56,219
Speaker 1: more importantly there will only be one oh shit in an episode.

603
00:29:56,259 --> 00:30:02,077
Speaker 0: right it's a totally different technique to start an episode like what is going on oh shit.

604
00:30:02,178 --> 00:30:04,483
Speaker 0: and then the whole episode is like crazy.

605
00:30:04,584 --> 00:30:11,070
Speaker 0: and the thing is Scott hyped it up because he watched the show and I was like I hyped it up because I couldn't help myself but then I was like Rym did I overhype it?

606
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:11,857
Speaker 1: oh my god.

607
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:25,755
Speaker 1: so literally 5 seconds into that episode 10 all of us are like oh shit and then we oh shit again and then again and again and it like and as soon as I'm like okay I see what's going on.

608
00:30:26,098 --> 00:30:30,018
Speaker 1: there was another oh shit that just blew everything out of the water like.

609
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:33,430
Speaker 1: I cannot express to you it was a similar feeling.

610
00:30:33,511 --> 00:30:45,380
Speaker 1: the last time an anime made me feel that way was that one episode of Utena with the the car and Anthony holding the candles and they're going out one by one and then you see somebody in the background.

611
00:30:46,892 --> 00:30:49,756
Speaker 1: that was the last time I had even close to that.

612
00:30:49,817 --> 00:30:52,260
Speaker 1: much oh shit in an episode of an anime.

613
00:30:52,280 --> 00:30:52,987
Speaker 0: I don't know.

614
00:30:53,007 --> 00:30:57,110
Speaker 0: I've had that a bunch of times but it hasn't been in a while because it hasn't been a good show in a while.

615
00:30:57,150 --> 00:31:02,340
Speaker 0: and I think the thing about this show I think the key is that it's 12 episodes right.

616
00:31:02,441 --> 00:31:06,927
Speaker 0: so every episode is the episode where X happens.

617
00:31:06,947 --> 00:31:08,401
Speaker 0: you know each episode is big.

618
00:31:08,603 --> 00:31:10,038
Speaker 0: there's no meaningless episodes.

619
00:31:10,078 --> 00:31:11,372
Speaker 0: there's no slow parts there's.

620
00:31:11,413 --> 00:31:11,655
Speaker 0: no.

621
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,310
Speaker 0: you know everything that happens.

622
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:18,826
Speaker 0: you know it's very economical with its scenes and everything is meaningful.

623
00:31:19,108 --> 00:31:23,250
Speaker 0: you're always in the heat of it and then before it drags on it ends.

624
00:31:23,795 --> 00:31:25,350
Speaker 0: it's like Gonzo shows.

625
00:31:25,471 --> 00:31:27,474
Speaker 0: if all the Gonzo shows like say Last Exile.

626
00:31:27,494 --> 00:31:34,281
Speaker 0: Last Exile started just about as strong as Madoka started but it had 26 episodes and it sort of dragged a bit.

627
00:31:34,302 --> 00:31:37,797
Speaker 0: I'm watching number 6 right now started pretty strong but dragged.

628
00:31:38,182 --> 00:31:39,798
Speaker 0: Eden of the East so I don't know.

629
00:31:39,838 --> 00:31:42,261
Speaker 0: I don't think that was as long but it you know it still.

630
00:31:42,464 --> 00:31:43,474
Speaker 1: it wasn't that it dragged.

631
00:31:43,514 --> 00:31:48,310
Speaker 0: is that it introduced characters I didn't care about right and or know why they were there or anything.

632
00:31:49,171 --> 00:31:52,098
Speaker 0: but you know Madoka perfect 12 episodes.

633
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:52,785
Speaker 0: we're ending it.

634
00:31:53,027 --> 00:31:53,876
Speaker 0: period done.

635
00:31:53,897 --> 00:31:58,404
Speaker 1: also it's very important to note that Madoka has a real ending.

636
00:31:58,424 --> 00:32:02,950
Speaker 0: yeah it's not like say shows like scrap princess.

637
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:05,866
Speaker 1: lets reveal the whole plot at the end out of nowhere.

638
00:32:05,886 --> 00:32:10,584
Speaker 1: or let's see Bokerano has a real ending too or a candidate for goddess.

639
00:32:10,645 --> 00:32:12,727
Speaker 0: right that show was one that was clearly was.

640
00:32:12,748 --> 00:32:22,586
Speaker 0: they were intending to go more than 13 episodes but they got cut to 13 and you could see the 13th episode was sort of like oh shit we weren't planning to end it right now but we have to.

641
00:32:22,666 --> 00:32:32,728
Speaker 0: so like Eden of the East had a stupid ending yeah but Madoka they knew they were going to end it at 12 episodes well in advance and they did so.

642
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:36,626
Speaker 0: so they brought it to the ending with the exact right pacing.

643
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:38,747
Speaker 0: it wasn't rushed it wasn't slow it was perfect.

644
00:32:38,848 --> 00:32:42,505
Speaker 1: and the thing is the show like as you're going on and more oh shits are happening.

645
00:32:42,526 --> 00:32:46,403
Speaker 1: you're like you're learning things about this universe like what is a magical girl?

646
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:48,080
Speaker 1: what is Cubase contract?

647
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,454
Speaker 1: what does all this really mean?

648
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:50,484
Speaker 1: who is Homura?

649
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:52,200
Speaker 1: why is she the way she is?

650
00:32:52,342 --> 00:32:53,210
Speaker 1: how does she know all this?

651
00:32:53,270 --> 00:32:54,784
Speaker 0: why is everyone the way they are?

652
00:32:54,804 --> 00:33:08,730
Speaker 1: and it gets to a point around episode 8 8 and a half where there is no conclusion you can make but that everybody's fucked in a way that is almost unimaginably depressing.

653
00:33:09,274 --> 00:33:17,817
Speaker 1: yeah like as an intelligent person you're like there is no way out of this and the way the show ends is pretty fantastic.

654
00:33:17,877 --> 00:33:18,463
Speaker 0: yeah it's pretty.

655
00:33:18,503 --> 00:33:19,857
Speaker 0: it's one of those you know.

656
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:23,594
Speaker 0: sometimes you'll be watching something and you'll be like just do this.

657
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:28,929
Speaker 1: just do this Scott it's we have to call this the guns moment when Neo is like guns.

658
00:33:30,291 --> 00:33:40,060
Speaker 0: exactly you're like just do this and then you get really happy because in the show they actually end up doing something pretty similar to what you were hoping someone would do right.

659
00:33:40,100 --> 00:33:45,110
Speaker 0: yeah like I was thinking the whole time just do this and in the end they did something sort of close.

660
00:33:45,171 --> 00:33:48,202
Speaker 1: they kind of was beyond what I thought I would be like.

661
00:33:48,222 --> 00:33:49,618
Speaker 1: do X. they were like do X times 10.

662
00:33:49,618 --> 00:33:55,475
Speaker 0: yeah it definitely was not exactly what I was thinking but it worked out you know in the same sort of way.

663
00:33:56,020 --> 00:34:04,301
Speaker 1: it's also very worth mentioning that the show has fantastic music but it has a very limited repertoire of songs that are used almost like leitmotifs.

664
00:34:04,322 --> 00:34:06,222
Speaker 1: there's like the action.

665
00:34:06,282 --> 00:34:07,010
Speaker 1: stuff is happening.

666
00:34:07,192 --> 00:34:07,636
Speaker 1: song.

667
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:11,637
Speaker 1: there is the variation on that for you're learning stuff about the universe.

668
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,377
Speaker 1: there is the ominous.

669
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:15,719
Speaker 1: you're learning stuff about the universe or is more questions.

670
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:15,981
Speaker 1: song.

671
00:34:16,244 --> 00:34:17,556
Speaker 1: there is the happy.

672
00:34:17,717 --> 00:34:18,647
Speaker 1: we are doing stuff.

673
00:34:18,667 --> 00:34:18,969
Speaker 1: song.

674
00:34:19,030 --> 00:34:23,981
Speaker 0: well actually if you pay attention right there's pretty much each of the girls has.

675
00:34:24,425 --> 00:34:27,255
Speaker 0: everyone has a theme song Scott that's called a leitmotif character.

676
00:34:27,275 --> 00:34:32,284
Speaker 0: right it's a leitmotif but most of the other songs are just variations of the opener or the closer.

677
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:34,121
Speaker 0: and the opener and the closer are great like.

678
00:34:34,324 --> 00:34:35,880
Speaker 0: they're super awesome.

679
00:34:35,900 --> 00:34:37,900
Speaker 1: they're reminiscent of good old anime.

680
00:34:37,962 --> 00:34:42,346
Speaker 1: yeah actually the opener song really reminds me of the song from the remake of bird of the mighty.

681
00:34:42,527 --> 00:34:44,668
Speaker 0: yeah the thing about the opener is like.

682
00:34:44,688 --> 00:34:48,750
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's the greatest song but I really like it and it gives me sort of this nostalgic feeling.

683
00:34:48,851 --> 00:34:50,549
Speaker 0: it feels like an older anime song.

684
00:34:50,731 --> 00:34:51,275
Speaker 1: well what's funny?

685
00:34:51,295 --> 00:34:54,309
Speaker 0: because you know it brings me back to like the 90s we're hanging out with.

686
00:34:54,471 --> 00:34:55,318
Speaker 1: and it's funny.

687
00:34:55,359 --> 00:35:02,690
Speaker 1: Scott has seen all of Madoka twice and I've seen it 1.7 times because our friend Nuri came.

688
00:35:02,771 --> 00:35:15,055
Speaker 1: we showed a bunch of our friends the first three episodes and she just stuck around instead of going home the next day to watch all the rest of the show up to episode 9. so me her and Emily could then finish it and then you know she couldn't.

689
00:35:15,075 --> 00:35:17,742
Speaker 1: she got to 9. she's like oh shit I can't watch more can I?

690
00:35:17,763 --> 00:35:18,349
Speaker 1: and I'm like hells.

691
00:35:18,389 --> 00:35:18,976
Speaker 1: no you can't.

692
00:35:19,542 --> 00:35:20,290
Speaker 0: well you could've just.

693
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,661
Speaker 1: no no no she couldn't.

694
00:35:22,972 --> 00:35:23,558
Speaker 1: so she was like.

695
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:24,509
Speaker 1: well what do I watch now?

696
00:35:25,192 --> 00:35:26,270
Speaker 1: something less hardcore.

697
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,409
Speaker 1: so I was like mahotsukaita.

698
00:35:31,292 --> 00:35:38,290
Speaker 1: but seriously this is the first time in history I have seen a show with music by Yuki Kajira where the show wasn't shit.

699
00:35:38,753 --> 00:35:42,910
Speaker 0: yeah I mean she's done actually in my opinion the hak-san music and the noir music.

700
00:35:43,052 --> 00:35:45,703
Speaker 0: I like those musics actually better than the Madoka music.

701
00:35:45,986 --> 00:35:47,849
Speaker 0: not that the Madoka music is that much worse.

702
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:51,770
Speaker 0: it's a step under mostly because there's less of it.

703
00:35:51,851 --> 00:35:58,390
Speaker 1: those were longer shows with arguably more complex plots though not better plots.

704
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,423
Speaker 1: like there's more stuff going on.

705
00:35:59,443 --> 00:36:09,379
Speaker 0: and also it's just that I tend to judge music not based on any sort of measure of musical quality because I don't know anything about music or music theory.

706
00:36:09,823 --> 00:36:17,349
Speaker 0: but it's like I like a song more if it gets stuck in my head even though you usually get annoyed when a song gets stuck in your head.

707
00:36:17,551 --> 00:36:20,470
Speaker 1: I had the closing song to Madoka stuck in my head.

708
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:24,570
Speaker 0: the opening and closings of Madoka definitely had head stickage.

709
00:36:24,691 --> 00:36:29,296
Speaker 1: but the other songs I had Mami's "I am awesome and happy doing awesome stuff" song.

710
00:36:29,316 --> 00:36:30,670
Speaker 0: that's definitely the third best song.

711
00:36:31,117 --> 00:36:35,768
Speaker 0: but the other music I can't really recall it.

712
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:36,518
Speaker 1: think about "Head Sign".

713
00:36:37,931 --> 00:36:48,970
Speaker 1: the only songs you remember are the "Key of the Twilight" song that opening the world song yup and maybe the "Ara" song which is the sad girl singing about sad people.

714
00:36:49,030 --> 00:36:49,715
Speaker 0: I remember songs.

715
00:36:52,093 --> 00:36:59,129
Speaker 0: not only do I remember the opening and closing songs but also multiples of the non opening and closing songs.

716
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:04,550
Speaker 1: granted Scott you were the one who with a straight face said that Giant Robo's music was uninspired and unmemorable.

717
00:37:04,954 --> 00:37:06,530
Speaker 0: I don't remember a single song from Giant Robo.

718
00:37:06,651 --> 00:37:08,990
Speaker 1: I think Giant Robo had one of the stronger anime soundtracks.

719
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:10,889
Speaker 0: I don't remember a single song from it at all.

720
00:37:11,132 --> 00:37:21,670
Speaker 0: if you played me the Giant Robo soundtrack and another similar soundtrack I probably would just be one out of two guesses to figure out which one's Giant Robo and which one's not.

721
00:37:21,915 --> 00:37:22,530
Speaker 1: so here's the deal.

722
00:37:23,216 --> 00:37:25,848
Speaker 1: back in the day, "Head Sign" the first episode.

723
00:37:26,635 --> 00:37:30,068
Speaker 1: that in of itself I was like this is some A material right here.

724
00:37:30,453 --> 00:37:34,512
Speaker 0: like it had everything cool but then nothing happened between episodes 5 and 13.

725
00:37:34,512 --> 00:37:35,650
Speaker 1: ah but pretend those didn't exist.

726
00:37:35,913 --> 00:37:39,350
Speaker 1: it had the awesome Yuki Kajiro music and the awesome hook.

727
00:37:40,255 --> 00:37:46,910
Speaker 1: that music alone tricked me into watching that show all the way to episode 13 before I realized it was shit and nothing else had happened.

728
00:37:48,161 --> 00:37:59,370
Speaker 1: same thing with "Head Sign" and "Noir" which was almost as bad as "Head Sign" just because the music made me think and the first episode combined made me think.

729
00:37:59,390 --> 00:38:00,790
Speaker 0: I think "Noir" was better than "Head Sign".

730
00:38:00,931 --> 00:38:03,950
Speaker 1: it was, but it was still bad, I got to the end and I regretted watching it.

731
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:06,368
Speaker 0: yeah the later parts of the show really jumped off the shark.

732
00:38:06,448 --> 00:38:08,069
Speaker 1: there I mean the first episode had.

733
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:14,290
Speaker 0: it was a guy jumping off a cliff and as he fell down the cliff he passed by a bunch of sharks also falling off the cliff.

734
00:38:14,491 --> 00:38:15,115
Speaker 1: but how come?

735
00:38:15,135 --> 00:38:22,650
Speaker 1: that's the same show that had the Yuki Kajiro music and it had the dude strangled with his own tie silhouetted off of a staircase.

736
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:28,269
Speaker 1: yeah, everyone remembers that scene in that show is just like the guy hitting the propeller in "Titanic".

737
00:38:28,573 --> 00:38:28,965
Speaker 0: oh shit.

738
00:38:30,575 --> 00:38:37,829
Speaker 1: so you've got that high quality really intense Yuki Kajiro music in a good show.

739
00:38:38,581 --> 00:38:40,329
Speaker 1: the show is good and the music is good.

740
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:43,189
Speaker 0: yup what else is good about the show?

741
00:38:43,950 --> 00:38:48,870
Speaker 0: the animation is actually just pretty normal modern animation, but there's some things about it.

742
00:38:49,094 --> 00:38:51,768
Speaker 0: number one is the magical girls fight.

743
00:38:51,808 --> 00:38:54,190
Speaker 0: bad guys these witches, obviously the magical girls.

744
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:55,205
Speaker 0: they're gonna fight something.

745
00:38:55,731 --> 00:39:01,310
Speaker 0: the witches are some EVA pop art material so the witches are all in these reality spheres.

746
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:14,090
Speaker 0: this isn't a spoiler whatever you want to call it, but basically whenever they fight the witches they sort of go to this other world to fight them and the other world has this crazy art style that's different for every witch and is nothing like anime style.

747
00:39:14,131 --> 00:39:22,930
Speaker 1: so you see the anime characters one of the witches they fight pretty early on is basically a Murakami super flat worm dragon unicorn bot.

748
00:39:24,018 --> 00:39:25,266
Speaker 0: so it's really awesome.

749
00:39:25,327 --> 00:39:29,730
Speaker 0: just to see what kind of crazy art is gonna be going on in the witches' reality marvel.

750
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:32,869
Speaker 1: you'll never see mustaches so sinister ever again.

751
00:39:33,991 --> 00:39:44,030
Speaker 0: it's crazy awesome, I love it whenever a witch comes, it's like a feast for the eyes to see what's going on with all the details in the background and all the other weird characters coming out.

752
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,126
Speaker 1: it's also a minor point, but the show is really colorful and it has.

753
00:39:48,531 --> 00:39:50,910
Speaker 0: sometimes it's really colorful and sometimes it's not.

754
00:39:51,051 --> 00:39:56,083
Speaker 1: but it has really cute young characters, but they're not moe, there's like no fan service at all, zero.

755
00:39:56,912 --> 00:40:02,770
Speaker 0: it's like the characters could be if you use them easily moe perverted characters.

756
00:40:02,891 --> 00:40:08,129
Speaker 0: but there's never any up skirts or boob shots, you know, the opener has a second of it.

757
00:40:08,736 --> 00:40:13,090
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about things to say about the opener that are kind of spoilers.

758
00:40:13,776 --> 00:40:15,130
Speaker 0: yeah, the opener is nothing like the show.

759
00:40:15,251 --> 00:40:24,422
Speaker 0: that's all you gotta know, but the thing is there's never any fan service or any porn or anything like that in the show ever, right?

760
00:40:24,483 --> 00:40:30,390
Speaker 0: They're just magical girls, their magical girl costumes are not revealing or porny at all you know, it's just straight up.

761
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:32,830
Speaker 1: but also they never go super deformed.

762
00:40:32,971 --> 00:40:36,950
Speaker 1: it doesn't really do any wacky anime stuff, it's actually a very tight and crisp looking show.

763
00:40:37,313 --> 00:40:54,008
Speaker 0: the only thing though is that sometimes they do this trick where they're drawn in a very digital clean modern way but their faces will sort of be sort of sketchy and pastel colored pencil manga-ish, so it's like you have a completely normal character, but like their eyes will be sort of scratchy.

764
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:57,949
Speaker 1: I really like the eyes, all the eyes almost look like they're out of a colored manga.

765
00:40:59,093 --> 00:41:02,369
Speaker 1: it's neat, the eyes stood out and I really like that style of eye.

766
00:41:02,472 --> 00:41:03,007
Speaker 0: it's pretty clever.

767
00:41:04,091 --> 00:41:05,601
Speaker 1: so who should watch the show?

768
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:12,450
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell you straight up it's very rare, it's been a long time since I have unhesitatingly called a show an A anime.

769
00:41:12,833 --> 00:41:16,061
Speaker 0: the thing is, I also call it an A anime but I don't call it an A+ anime.

770
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:26,530
Speaker 1: well A+ is different, A+ has the combination of universal appeal brilliant both from like the fanboy perspective and from the like, just art perspective.

771
00:41:26,752 --> 00:41:38,208
Speaker 1: yeah, it's not Kawaii Bebop, it's not a Miyazaki movie, it's not Matt Cross TV, you know but it holds its own next to Escaflowne, next to Trigun, it pumped me up similarly to the way Kawaii Bebop pumped me up.

772
00:41:38,371 --> 00:41:41,630
Speaker 0: I call it Exactly Equal with Big O which is great.

773
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:47,049
Speaker 0: it's Exactly Equal with Big O which also had 13 episodes in its first season.

774
00:41:47,995 --> 00:42:01,350
Speaker 0: it did, but I've actually heard a rumor of a Madoka's second season not really a second season but a you know, another show where you take the characters and it's just happy school time the whole time.

775
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:05,889
Speaker 1: I know leave it alone, you know what that would be like?

776
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:09,590
Speaker 1: that would be like if you had Cowgirl Ed and Ayn's adventures.

777
00:42:09,895 --> 00:42:10,789
Speaker 0: well, didn't we want that?

778
00:42:11,552 --> 00:42:13,670
Speaker 1: no, I wanted that, but I didn't really want it.

779
00:42:13,771 --> 00:42:24,870
Speaker 0: right, exactly, I think it's one of those situations where because it was 12 episodes right, you know, usually most of these shows follow a path where it's happy school time and then later on the darkness.

780
00:42:25,091 --> 00:42:27,830
Speaker 0: this show is the darkness from before.

781
00:42:28,334 --> 00:42:30,150
Speaker 0: in the first one second is the darkness.

782
00:42:30,251 --> 00:42:32,553
Speaker 1: it's like episode 1, you really want to be a magical girl?

783
00:42:32,614 --> 00:42:38,590
Speaker 1: episode 2, here's what it's really like, episode 3, off the deep end and you still got a bunch more episodes.

784
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,075
Speaker 0: 9, 9 episodes.

785
00:42:42,735 --> 00:42:43,019
Speaker 1: but

786
00:42:43,201 --> 00:42:59,529
Speaker 0: other shows start off with a lot more school a lot more getting to know the characters a lot more side characters that are humorous that fade away and aren't in the show later on stuff like that, and this show didn't have any of that because it only had 12 episodes and I think because it was popular they want to go back to

787
00:42:59,549 --> 00:42:59,590
Speaker 1: it.

788
00:42:59,630 --> 00:43:15,049
Speaker 1: yet it lulls you into a sense of complacency because after alright, it's magical girls, let's go you really expect them to be just fighting witches and it presents itself like alright, they're going to fight this witch and then no that's not what happens.

789
00:43:15,291 --> 00:43:17,509
Speaker 0: you don't know what's going to happen, it's crazy awesome.

790
00:43:18,816 --> 00:43:19,670
Speaker 1: so who should watch the show?

791
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:26,908
Speaker 0: like we said, everyone, the reason I say you've never watched an anime in your life ever, and you're not a big if you're a big nerd.

792
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,290
Speaker 0: you've never watched an anime before.

793
00:43:30,097 --> 00:43:37,834
Speaker 0: this might actually be a good thing to watch because if I had watched this when I was in high school since I was a nerd, I would have been blown away by it.

794
00:43:37,854 --> 00:43:42,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, when I was in fourth grade and I saw Vampire Hunter D and I was blown away by it this would have blown me away the same way

795
00:43:43,010 --> 00:43:47,693
Speaker 0: but I might not have fully understood it and would have had to come back later with more anime knowledge much

796
00:43:47,753 --> 00:43:49,310
Speaker 1: like when I saw the first Tenchi movie.

797
00:43:49,451 --> 00:43:50,663
Speaker 1: I had no idea what was going on.

798
00:43:50,683 --> 00:43:53,007
Speaker 0: Clearly if you're already an anime fan, just watch it.

799
00:43:53,997 --> 00:43:57,710
Speaker 0: even if you don't like it, it's only 12 episodes, just do it right?

800
00:43:59,432 --> 00:44:06,563
Speaker 0: and you know, the only people who really shouldn't, probably should avoid it, are people who aren't anime fans yet and also aren't nerds.

801
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:15,050
Speaker 0: They need to come into anime, you know, like the Kaveh Bebop Road and the Miyazaki Road Unless they're one of those people who remembers like, "Oh, as a kid I watched Sailor Moon".

802
00:44:15,471 --> 00:44:17,270
Speaker 1: you just tell them, "This is Sailor Moon for grown-ups".

803
00:44:17,631 --> 00:44:19,310
Speaker 0: Maybe, it might work, it might not.

804
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:25,410
Speaker 1: I think it would work, because the show doesn't have all that build-up, it gets right into the thick of it, so you're pretty much.

805
00:44:26,133 --> 00:44:34,296
Speaker 1: it only takes a few minutes to get hooked in and I can't think of many people who, once they start watching it would at least not want to know what happens.

806
00:44:34,801 --> 00:44:38,278
Speaker 0: I've also seen so I've seen some people on the internet complaining they don't like the ending.

807
00:44:38,318 --> 00:44:38,762
Speaker 0: You're wrong.

808
00:44:38,802 --> 00:44:39,610
Speaker 0: They can all shut up.

809
00:44:39,650 --> 00:44:41,530
Speaker 0: They're probably the same people who don't like Eva.

810
00:44:41,772 --> 00:44:44,863
Speaker 1: Well, they hate this ending for the same reasons.

811
00:44:44,903 --> 00:44:47,410
Speaker 1: they hate the Eva ending, even though the endings are actually very different.

812
00:44:47,672 --> 00:44:49,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it doesn't matter, the point is all those people suck.

813
00:44:50,178 --> 00:44:54,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're seriously, if you're not satisfied with the end of the show suck it.

814
00:44:54,241 --> 00:44:54,709
Speaker 1: Get out of here.

815
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:59,900
Speaker 0: Uh, there's something else, but whatever There's a lot else.

816
00:44:59,981 --> 00:45:06,389
Speaker 1: When we watched the show you know, saw the end and some shows, like I say, finish the show, and then I just turn it off.

817
00:45:06,934 --> 00:45:14,409
Speaker 1: but some shows, the credits just play all the way to the end and everyone sits in the room quiet until there is literally no more to see.

818
00:45:14,591 --> 00:45:19,335
Speaker 0: And then, oh, there's something after the final credits like 20 seconds worth, so you should watch that.

819
00:45:19,477 --> 00:45:21,801
Speaker 1: But, you know, you can tell when the show is an A anime.

820
00:45:21,862 --> 00:45:24,649
Speaker 1: I think my definition of an A anime, it makes that list.

821
00:45:25,235 --> 00:45:32,225
Speaker 1: if the majority of the people you show it to, when it ends, will sit in the room quietly until the last of the credits are gone.

822
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,094
Speaker 0: That's one factor.

823
00:45:33,175 --> 00:45:40,890
Speaker 0: The other factors are you watch an episode and you just want to keep watching and you can't help yourself, and B, re-watching is good.

824
00:45:41,132 --> 00:45:46,246
Speaker 0: Like, if you can actually re-watch it and enjoy it again, if you get all those three things, it's an A anime.

825
00:45:46,448 --> 00:45:48,062
Speaker 1: Yes, and it does the Utena thing.

826
00:45:48,082 --> 00:45:48,849
Speaker 1: You watch it again.

827
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:51,189
Speaker 1: everything you needed to know was there.

828
00:45:51,912 --> 00:46:00,426
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you watch the first episode after knowing the ending and people say things and you're like putting your hand over your mouth like, "Oh my god, they said that in episode one, I can't

829
00:46:00,447 --> 00:46:00,730
Speaker 0: believe!".

830
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:06,501
Speaker 1: Hell, you watch this, every single episode has moments of, "Oh shit, oh really?

831
00:46:06,808 --> 00:46:08,001
Speaker 1: Oh, why didn't I notice that

832
00:46:08,062 --> 00:46:08,588
Speaker 1: before?".

833
00:46:08,871 --> 00:46:09,416
Speaker 0: "I can't believe.

834
00:46:09,436 --> 00:46:11,515
Speaker 0: they said that so early and I didn't notice

835
00:46:11,536 --> 00:46:11,576
Speaker 0: it.".

836
00:46:12,506 --> 00:46:14,427
Speaker 0: And there's only 12 episodes and they fit it all in.

837
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:18,043
Speaker 1: This is one of the best anime I've seen in a long time.

838
00:46:18,083 --> 00:46:18,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, best.

839
00:46:19,013 --> 00:46:20,850
Speaker 0: I definitely call it best recent anime.

840
00:46:21,714 --> 00:46:27,249
Speaker 1: The last show that was as good as this that I watched was re-watching 2nd Gig Ghost in the Shell.

841
00:46:27,675 --> 00:46:30,150
Speaker 0: One more note just historically on the show, right?

842
00:46:30,992 --> 00:46:34,350
Speaker 0: The final episode of the show was delayed by the real earthquake.

843
00:46:34,653 --> 00:46:36,409
Speaker 1: Oh my god, I couldn't have dealt with that.

844
00:46:36,792 --> 00:46:41,050
Speaker 0: And then it came out in Japan much later and still got crazy ratings.

845
00:46:41,494 --> 00:46:45,515
Speaker 1: Well think about it, Scott, imagine if you had seen up to episode 11 and then you had to wait.

846
00:46:45,858 --> 00:46:46,161
Speaker 1: Yeah.

847
00:46:46,363 --> 00:46:49,333
Speaker 1: You would have been waiting as badly as we're waiting for the second season of Ponies.

848
00:46:49,353 --> 00:46:54,570
Speaker 0: That's why I don't wait, I just download the whole show at once and watch it all at once in one afternoon and one morning.

849
00:47:00,739 --> 00:47:02,992
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
