1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,629
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, April 4th, 2023.

2
00:00:09,629 --> 00:00:09,830
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,500
Speaker 1: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,924
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,964 --> 00:00:19,840
Speaker 0: Tonight, we are reviewing the hot new trick-taking game, Cat in the Box.

6
00:00:20,761 --> 00:00:21,758
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,968
Speaker 0: So, uh, today is a date that is actually pretty important.

8
00:00:27,009 --> 00:00:32,320
Speaker 0: Like, two earth-changing things happened in very different contexts today.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:43,608
Speaker 0: And I think, I suspect, most of you listening, partly because of the American-centered focus of a lot of pop culture and, like, the kind of person who would listen to Geek Nights, you're probably thinking about the whole Trumpy thing that just happened.

10
00:00:44,049 --> 00:00:47,540
Speaker 0: But a way, way more important thing happened today.

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:54,080
Speaker 0: Finland, officially, has joined the NATO military defensive pact in Europe.

12
00:00:54,722 --> 00:00:57,900
Speaker 0: And you might be wondering, why is that such a big deal?

13
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:13,340
Speaker 0: Well, if you don't know the history of NATO, it was originally formed, essentially, to be the military alliance to make sure the Soviet Union didn't invade Europe after World War II, and that existence during the early Cold War didn't actually last that long.

14
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:27,490
Speaker 0: NATO evolved very rapidly into being a couple of things, and it's effectively a purely defensive military alliance whose primary mission is to say, "Yo, countries can't invade each other like it's the 1800s.

15
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:30,597
Speaker 0: If anyone invades any of our members, it's war with all of us.

16
00:01:30,678 --> 00:01:31,399
Speaker 0: Stay out of Castle

17
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:31,600
Speaker 0: Lemongrab.".

18
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:36,611
Speaker 1: Right, and there's so many of us, and we're basically the strongest, right?

19
00:01:36,671 --> 00:01:40,000
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's pretty much like a war game you play, right?

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,264
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday Geek Nights, right?

21
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:42,247
Speaker 1: You play a board game.

22
00:01:42,387 --> 00:01:46,700
Speaker 1: Imagine, you know, if there wasn't some end game, because it's not a board game.

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,394
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can't win the real world.

24
00:01:48,414 --> 00:01:49,060
Speaker 0: It's not like CIV.

25
00:01:49,802 --> 00:02:09,880
Speaker 1: Right, and it's just like, imagine if there's like, you know, many, many players that are all like really strong, and like they've maxed out their tech charts and everything, and all of them are officially on the same team, and if you attack any one of them, they literally all attack you, and their combined might is like several times greater than the rest of the world combined.

26
00:02:10,419 --> 00:02:13,660
Speaker 1: It's like, well, I guess you just can't fuck with any of them, right?

27
00:02:14,061 --> 00:02:21,460
Speaker 0: And if you don't attack them, they kind of just sit there, at least militarily, like their army isn't like moving around on your borders, it's just sitting there.

28
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:25,765
Speaker 1: Right, so now imagine, right, there's two things additionally to imagine, right?

29
00:02:25,785 --> 00:02:38,781
Speaker 1: The first thing is imagine you're not in that alliance, and some country that isn't very big population-wise, but is very, very strong military-wise relative to its population, or maybe

30
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,905
Speaker 0: they're just next to you and way big,

31
00:02:42,548 --> 00:02:48,660
Speaker 1: joins that alliance like decades, you know, maybe even almost a century after it was created, and now it's even bigger.

32
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:49,160
Speaker 1: Well,

33
00:02:49,180 --> 00:03:11,860
Speaker 0: especially if you even, even like four years ago, three years ago, in fact, I would say up until the Russian illegal invasion of Ukraine started, if you asked anyone on Earth, anywhere in the world, who had heard of Finland and heard of NATO and knew anything about them, if NATO would ever join Finland, they would laugh at you and run out of breath laughing.

34
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,264
Speaker 0: Nobody in the world thought Finland would ever join NATO.

35
00:03:15,324 --> 00:03:16,886
Speaker 0: Now, Finland worked with NATO.

36
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:28,580
Speaker 0: Finland is very closely aligned with NATO, but Finland would never join, partly due to Finland's history of being invaded by the Soviets and the Nazis simultaneously and getting very spiky as a result.

37
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:34,630
Speaker 0: That's a summary of a lot of history that is glossing over a lot of details, but it's kind of how it went down.

38
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:40,580
Speaker 0: So Finland really tried to be a country that said we're not aligned with anyone, just don't fuck with us.

39
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:48,408
Speaker 0: Russia's aggression has gotten to the point to where Finland is actually afraid that Russia might do something to them, and that is why they joined.

40
00:03:48,669 --> 00:03:55,438
Speaker 0: Public opinion was like 10% of Finns wanted to join NATO, and after Russia invaded Ukraine, like 91% wanted to join NATO.

41
00:03:57,681 --> 00:04:07,000
Speaker 1: The second thing I wanted you to imagine is imagine you're playing in this war game, and there's some giant alliance that's unbeatable, but it never attacks anyone.

42
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:10,140
Speaker 0: And you're trading with it heavily, like all your trade routes go there already.

43
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,645
Speaker 1: Right, and it's like it's over there, but you're not in it, right?

44
00:04:14,106 --> 00:04:16,310
Speaker 1: But now you're in it.

45
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:22,260
Speaker 1: It's like you're feeling, like imagine the feeling of safety that has just appeared, right?

46
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:34,380
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, there's this giant thing that is the most dangerous alliance of all the great, it's an all-star team basically, and it's like now you're on that all-star team.

47
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,568
Speaker 1: It's like the feeling that you would have, right, joining that team.

48
00:04:40,472 --> 00:04:43,117
Speaker 1: It's like ah, no one can fuck with me now, right?

49
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,440
Speaker 1: It's like I don't have to worry anymore.

50
00:04:45,201 --> 00:05:01,660
Speaker 0: And the other function that NATO provides is often if the UN or a collective of democratically-leaning nations want to intervene in, say, a genocide situation, it's almost always going to be NATO that actually does that work, but that's actually a secondary function.

51
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:04,259
Speaker 0: It's primary function is- It depends where the genociding is.

52
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:13,399
Speaker 0: Yes, and it also depends on the complications of the UN and a bunch of stuff that's out of scope for geek nights, not because we don't want to talk about it, because you should not be listening to us talk about it.

53
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:15,980
Speaker 1: Trying to keep it, you know, it's Tuesday, right?

54
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:23,490
Speaker 0: It is Tuesday, but what I'll say is, in my opinion, this is a win for the world.

55
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:30,420
Speaker 0: Like, it is rare that we get news where I would say that is no strings attached, just good news that made the world a safer place.

56
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,867
Speaker 0: Like, and I'm guilty of this, especially, you know, Twitter.

57
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:39,780
Speaker 0: less so, because I don't use Twitter anymore, but of really focusing on the things that are fucked up and the battles we're losing around the world.

58
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,348
Speaker 0: But wins do happen, and I think it's important to celebrate them when they do.

59
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,574
Speaker 0: And this is just good news for the world that this happened.

60
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:51,260
Speaker 0: We are materially safer today than we were yesterday as a world.

61
00:05:51,805 --> 00:05:52,899
Speaker 1: No, the people of Finland are.

62
00:05:53,180 --> 00:06:01,116
Speaker 0: Well, arguably everyone else, because this likely will deter further Russian escalation of this conflict, because now they can't fuck with Finland.

63
00:06:01,377 --> 00:06:02,820
Speaker 0: Sweden's about to join NATO as well.

64
00:06:03,181 --> 00:06:07,615
Speaker 0: As soon as there is no official war anymore, Ukraine is going to join NATO.

65
00:06:07,755 --> 00:06:09,280
Speaker 0: It's starting to come together.

66
00:06:11,161 --> 00:06:13,027
Speaker 0: And of course, the Trump thing happened today, but whatever.

67
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:16,780
Speaker 0: He was charged with 34 felony counts, and it's now a component situation.

68
00:06:16,861 --> 00:06:19,040
Speaker 1: I still haven't seen what exactly the felonies were.

69
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:19,602
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, you can.

70
00:06:20,264 --> 00:06:21,608
Speaker 0: The arraignment happened today.

71
00:06:21,628 --> 00:06:23,254
Speaker 0: The indictment was released.

72
00:06:23,454 --> 00:06:24,237
Speaker 0: You can just read it.

73
00:06:24,698 --> 00:06:25,240
Speaker 1: I have not read it.

74
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:28,600
Speaker 1: I thought that they were, wasn't it all like, you know, like falsification of business records?

75
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:40,540
Speaker 0: So the fun part is, this is a full, this is, all I'll say is, this is the least dangerous thing that is happening to that dude right now in terms of lawsuits and criminal charges.

76
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,987
Speaker 0: Like, this is the lowest hanging, weakest thing.

77
00:06:44,589 --> 00:06:48,458
Speaker 0: But even this, every one of those counts theoretically could be four years in prison.

78
00:06:48,498 --> 00:06:49,380
Speaker 0: It's a classy felony.

79
00:06:50,141 --> 00:06:56,540
Speaker 1: Right, and it's like people think like, oh, they're getting, you know, it's, you know, you think, okay, they got Al Capone like on some technicality, right?

80
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,680
Speaker 1: But it's like, tax evasion is a normal crime that people get in trouble for all the time.

81
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,183
Speaker 0: Yeah, falsifying business records too.

82
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:10,360
Speaker 0: Like if I falsified one business record for gig nights, like to cheat on my taxes or something, I would go to fucking prison.

83
00:07:11,021 --> 00:07:16,734
Speaker 1: Right, this isn't some weird, it's, you know, even though you think, ah, they didn't get him on the thing he really did, right?

84
00:07:16,774 --> 00:07:19,480
Speaker 1: The thing he really did was evil XYZ, right?

85
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,474
Speaker 1: It's like, but this is a crime that is commonly charged to various shady business people.

86
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:27,980
Speaker 1: Like people go to prison for this all the time.

87
00:07:28,721 --> 00:07:29,723
Speaker 1: It's a regular deal.

88
00:07:30,203 --> 00:07:32,046
Speaker 1: It's not strange, right?

89
00:07:32,387 --> 00:07:40,400
Speaker 1: It just happens to be the thing that the New York DA investigated and found and believes they found evidence of and has a case for.

90
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,243
Speaker 1: And so that is what they chose to charge him with.

91
00:07:43,964 --> 00:07:55,801
Speaker 1: And it's a thing that evil people do a lot, which is, you know, when they do their accounting, they write down that they spent the money on thing A, when actually the money was spent on thing B. And you know what?

92
00:07:55,841 --> 00:08:00,125
Speaker 1: It's a crime, even if thing A and thing B are both legal things.

93
00:08:00,245 --> 00:08:13,720
Speaker 1: Like if you, if you have, if I have a, I don't know, a grocery store and I write down that I spent a thousand dollars on potatoes and I spent the thousand dollars on employees, that's a crime.

94
00:08:14,021 --> 00:08:17,840
Speaker 1: I have to write down what I spent the money for truthfully in my accounting.

95
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,140
Speaker 0: And the funniest part of this.

96
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:26,740
Speaker 1: And if I was a grocery store and I did that and the amount of money was big enough to draw attention, I would get charged with the same crime, not thirty four times.

97
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:32,429
Speaker 0: And the argument American Republicans are making across the board today is actually kind of funny.

98
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:34,332
Speaker 0: And I feel like this isn't going to work out.

99
00:08:34,373 --> 00:08:38,580
Speaker 0: They're basically saying you're only charged with this because he's Trump and you're politicized.

100
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:39,365
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

101
00:08:39,405 --> 00:08:40,938
Speaker 1: is people get charged with this all the time.

102
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,859
Speaker 0: What they're actually saying is you charged a rich person with a crime that only poor people are supposed to go to prison for.

103
00:08:47,703 --> 00:08:50,320
Speaker 0: Oh, that's what they're actually saying.

104
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,875
Speaker 1: But rich people are charged with this crime also.

105
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,000
Speaker 1: They usually just the only the truly evil ones actually do it.

106
00:08:57,280 --> 00:09:01,480
Speaker 0: Or they plead guilty and agree to a plea deal or something.

107
00:09:02,201 --> 00:09:03,472
Speaker 1: Or I'm surprised they didn't do that.

108
00:09:03,512 --> 00:09:04,360
Speaker 1: That's what you should have done.

109
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:04,821
Speaker 1: Yeah.

110
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:08,620
Speaker 0: Well, there's a lot going on there that I think is out of the scope of a Tuesday gig nights.

111
00:09:09,622 --> 00:09:12,619
Speaker 1: Or they rich people wisely get away with it.

112
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,161
Speaker 1: Right.

113
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:18,800
Speaker 0: By not being not being mafia like fake mafioso incompetent.

114
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:23,040
Speaker 0: His lawyer sounds like a like a bad mafia actor from a B movie.

115
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,859
Speaker 0: It's really funny to listen to this, dude.

116
00:09:25,422 --> 00:09:28,040
Speaker 0: But I guess this is not a small deal.

117
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:28,621
Speaker 0: What happened?

118
00:09:29,143 --> 00:09:35,120
Speaker 0: and like don't pop the corks on the champagne about how he's finally going down because there's a long road to come.

119
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,439
Speaker 0: Like, don't hold your breath on this.

120
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,940
Speaker 1: But this is not to say he's not guilty to be a hung jury.

121
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,247
Speaker 0: A lot of luck could happen.

122
00:09:41,267 --> 00:09:42,473
Speaker 0: But this is not.

123
00:09:42,835 --> 00:09:43,840
Speaker 0: this is not nothing.

124
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,139
Speaker 0: This is a real danger to this dude.

125
00:09:47,946 --> 00:09:48,640
Speaker 1: He's not happy.

126
00:09:48,942 --> 00:09:50,577
Speaker 0: No, he is definitely not happy.

127
00:09:52,161 --> 00:09:53,303
Speaker 0: What if CNN was great?

128
00:09:53,343 --> 00:10:00,980
Speaker 0: I was actually watching CNN at work when it went down and CNN was like, he looks irritated and angry and deflated.

129
00:10:01,622 --> 00:10:04,920
Speaker 0: And then one of the other CNN people is like, that is not the face of defiance.

130
00:10:05,081 --> 00:10:06,089
Speaker 0: And then he starts laughing.

131
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:07,380
Speaker 0: And this was on the air live.

132
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:09,221
Speaker 1: All right.

133
00:10:09,762 --> 00:10:24,020
Speaker 0: In tragic news, Klaus Teuber, who you may know as the designer of Settlers of Catan, one of the most important board games to ever be written and designed, has died after a brief and severe illness.

134
00:10:24,221 --> 00:10:25,288
Speaker 0: He was 70.

135
00:10:25,288 --> 00:10:27,200
Speaker 0: His family confirmed the death in a press release.

136
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,819
Speaker 0: The tabletop world is mourning this man.

137
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:33,474
Speaker 1: I mean, I mean, what I what I heard is least from the.

138
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:34,880
Speaker 1: you know, it's not a person ever knew.

139
00:10:35,241 --> 00:10:35,563
Speaker 1: Right.

140
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:35,804
Speaker 0: Yeah.

141
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:38,560
Speaker 1: But to my knowledge, not some milkshake duck.

142
00:10:38,641 --> 00:10:40,099
Speaker 1: He was just like a nice old man.

143
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:40,461
Speaker 1: Yeah.

144
00:10:40,903 --> 00:10:42,090
Speaker 0: I've never heard of any.

145
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:43,679
Speaker 0: I've never heard a negative story about him.

146
00:10:44,482 --> 00:10:44,744
Speaker 1: All right.

147
00:10:44,804 --> 00:10:47,039
Speaker 1: But basically, he didn't actually design that many games.

148
00:10:47,783 --> 00:10:49,400
Speaker 1: But there are others that you may have heard.

149
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:49,905
Speaker 0: Let's see.

150
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:50,740
Speaker 0: I've played Hoity Toity.

151
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:51,710
Speaker 1: The Endecker.

152
00:10:51,832 --> 00:10:52,076
Speaker 1: Right.

153
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:52,300
Speaker 0: Yeah.

154
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:53,879
Speaker 1: Hoity Toity is a big one.

155
00:10:54,121 --> 00:10:54,577
Speaker 0: Hoity Toity.

156
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,619
Speaker 1: Because it was the only good one.

157
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,239
Speaker 1: Settlers just so much bigger.

158
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:00,860
Speaker 0: Yeah.

159
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Speaker 0: And Settlers like to give you a sense, but gig nights, if Settlers hadn't been made and we hadn't encountered it when we did, I don't think gig nights would have formed.

160
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:18,739
Speaker 0: I don't even know if our friendship like that Settlers of Catan was deeply foundational to my life because of when and how I encountered it.

161
00:11:19,341 --> 00:11:19,441
Speaker 1: Yeah.

162
00:11:19,462 --> 00:11:22,260
Speaker 1: I mean, prior to right going to college, right.

163
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:26,680
Speaker 1: You know, the board games I knew were the ones they had at the toy store, some of which were nerdy.

164
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:26,941
Speaker 1: Right.

165
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:29,120
Speaker 1: Like Axis and Allies, Risk, Shogun.

166
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,145
Speaker 1: Yeah.

167
00:11:30,246 --> 00:11:31,438
Speaker 1: Which is renamed ten times.

168
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:34,138
Speaker 0: IkuSub.

169
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,280
Speaker 1: And then there were the ones that they had at the gaming store, BattleTech, D&D.

170
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:39,445
Speaker 1: Right.

171
00:11:40,071 --> 00:11:40,860
Speaker 1: Magic the Gathering.

172
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:41,221
Speaker 1: Yeah.

173
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:43,640
Speaker 1: These were the nerdy tabletop game.

174
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:47,920
Speaker 0: I think the nerdiest tabletop game I knew of were those war games, but I didn't actually know what they were like.

175
00:11:48,721 --> 00:11:48,881
Speaker 1: Yeah.

176
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:57,240
Speaker 1: In the United States, it's like the board games didn't really, like there weren't lots of new ones, you know.

177
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:05,460
Speaker 1: It's like occasionally you might see one that was like, you know, even when I thought there was a new one, like I was a kid watching TV to be a commercial for some new board game.

178
00:12:05,901 --> 00:12:14,940
Speaker 1: And it would be like, there were always usually kids board games and you'd think it was a new one, but actually it was just a reprint of some Milton Bradley one from the sixties or the fifties.

179
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:18,220
Speaker 1: Or it's like, you know, it's like they, or it was an already existing game.

180
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:21,580
Speaker 1: They got reprinted and they updated the graphics and they put out ads for it.

181
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:25,720
Speaker 1: Very rare that there were truly new board games in the US on the market.

182
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:33,540
Speaker 1: And if they weren't the Milton Bradley Parker Brothers ones that were in the toy store, they weren't in, they weren't available easily at all.

183
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,021
Speaker 1: Right.

184
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:44,800
Speaker 1: And then settlers came along and we were in college and some people were playing settlers and I was like, I was not interested in whatever that was, even though I knew nothing about whatever that was.

185
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:48,733
Speaker 0: And partly like, to be fair, part of the reason we were interested is people playing.

186
00:12:48,793 --> 00:12:49,616
Speaker 0: it were a little shady.

187
00:12:49,636 --> 00:12:50,960
Speaker 0: I'm just going to leave it at that.

188
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:58,460
Speaker 1: But they were, I'm like, all I knew is that those people over there that I don't want to mess with are playing, are doing something called settlers and they're doing it all the time.

189
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,766
Speaker 1: And I don't want to be with those people.

190
00:13:01,027 --> 00:13:04,939
Speaker 1: So I don't want to be with that settlers, whatever that settlers is, it's got nothing to do with me.

191
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:05,660
Speaker 1: Meh.

192
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,375
Speaker 0: And we kind of just ended up playing a game with them one night.

193
00:13:08,395 --> 00:13:09,240
Speaker 0: I don't remember why.

194
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:13,199
Speaker 1: Somehow I ended up playing the settlers and I'm like, oh, that's what this is.

195
00:13:16,085 --> 00:13:18,340
Speaker 0: And we thought it was a rule.

196
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:21,881
Speaker 1: This is the year 2000.

197
00:13:21,881 --> 00:13:22,061
Speaker 0: Yep.

198
00:13:22,182 --> 00:13:23,966
Speaker 0: God damn, that was a long time ago.

199
00:13:23,986 --> 00:13:29,500
Speaker 0: I just like, I just like flash back to how much, how much of my life I've lived since that point.

200
00:13:30,581 --> 00:13:38,200
Speaker 0: But I remember we thought the way the robber worked is if someone rolled a seven, everyone had to give them a card and the robber moved to the desert.

201
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:47,800
Speaker 1: That's not what I, no, I thought that it was just customary to try to bribe them with a card so that you could convince them not to bribe, not to attack you.

202
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:56,160
Speaker 0: But, you know, they refused to continue to play with us after Scott put, just took a bribe and then put the robber on a guy.

203
00:13:56,301 --> 00:13:58,400
Speaker 0: Anyway, the guy got so mad, we never played with them again.

204
00:13:59,826 --> 00:14:01,099
Speaker 0: But we had our own copy by that point.

205
00:14:02,001 --> 00:14:06,320
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point was, is that, you know, we had the settlers and we started playing that a whole bunch.

206
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:17,980
Speaker 1: And then that pretty much led us to go, you know, we went to the game store where I was already going to the game store, but I wasn't looking, you know, for anything other than, you know, RPGs, Battletechs, card games.

207
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:20,800
Speaker 0: And we started to look at the shelf we never looked at normally.

208
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,200
Speaker 0: Right.

209
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:29,840
Speaker 1: There was the shelf over the dice or the shelf of board games that were not Toys R Us, toy store games.

210
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:33,514
Speaker 1: And I was like, oh, well, this is the section where the settlers comes from.

211
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:34,960
Speaker 1: It's the section the settlers is in.

212
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:36,571
Speaker 1: But there's other things here.

213
00:14:36,631 --> 00:14:37,579
Speaker 1: Let's take a look at those.

214
00:14:38,062 --> 00:14:41,280
Speaker 1: And we're still here 23 years later looking at those other ones.

215
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,016
Speaker 1: And it's become, you know, I guess we were ahead of the curve.

216
00:14:45,056 --> 00:14:45,800
Speaker 1: We were so cool.

217
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:54,557
Speaker 1: But it became a phenomenon of, you know, the European non toy store, quote, designer board games are now a huge thing.

218
00:14:54,617 --> 00:14:55,659
Speaker 1: Everybody's all over it.

219
00:14:56,382 --> 00:14:59,934
Speaker 0: I mean, now, like settlers is in the toy stores like that.

220
00:15:00,094 --> 00:15:00,355
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

221
00:15:00,395 --> 00:15:01,720
Speaker 0: That is not how it was.

222
00:15:02,460 --> 00:15:13,960
Speaker 0: And while we've been right on settlers, probably because we played it out, I've played settlers easily over 100 times, probably a couple of hundred times because I used to play a lot, especially with the five, six player expansion.

223
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:17,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I only played the cities and nights a few times.

224
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:18,252
Speaker 0: I actually enjoyed it.

225
00:15:18,312 --> 00:15:20,840
Speaker 1: It was pretty good, but not that many times.

226
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:27,860
Speaker 0: But while we have played settlers out, like I still recommend settlers to people all the time because it is a fantastic game.

227
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:33,180
Speaker 0: Don't judge a game by what it's like when Fox only final destination happens.

228
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:34,040
Speaker 0: Right.

229
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,764
Speaker 1: It's like if you've played settlers, you know, it's like that's really.

230
00:15:36,804 --> 00:15:55,220
Speaker 1: the only criticism you can make of settlers is that if you have played it many, many, many times and you are, you know, someone who really thinks about winning and strategy and tries hard at games to win, you will see the truth of settlers, which is that if all players are pro, the dice will determine the winner.

231
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:55,581
Speaker 1: Yep.

232
00:15:55,722 --> 00:15:55,943
Speaker 1: Right.

233
00:15:56,043 --> 00:15:56,966
Speaker 1: That's just you might.

234
00:15:57,007 --> 00:16:00,460
Speaker 1: So if all players are pro, you might as well toss a coin to see who won.

235
00:16:01,201 --> 00:16:03,747
Speaker 0: But that applies to every game ever designed on Earth.

236
00:16:03,928 --> 00:16:04,108
Speaker 1: Right.

237
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:04,970
Speaker 1: Right.

238
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,980
Speaker 0: But well, well, other than the arbitrary ones, the draw ones and the solvable ones.

239
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:19,220
Speaker 1: What I'm saying is that it's possible, you know, going through the motions of a settlers instead of tossing a coin might be satisfying, even though you wreck everyone recognizes the dice, determine the result.

240
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:26,012
Speaker 1: But if any number of players are not pro settlers is is like a for real game.

241
00:16:26,392 --> 00:16:28,696
Speaker 1: There isn't really you know, it's it's.

242
00:16:29,618 --> 00:16:30,980
Speaker 1: it's like what's wrong with it?

243
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,200
Speaker 1: Yeah.

244
00:16:31,441 --> 00:16:32,283
Speaker 0: I mean, think about it.

245
00:16:32,323 --> 00:16:34,148
Speaker 0: We talk like a tabletop game.

246
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:38,980
Speaker 0: If it hits the table 10 times, that's already a legendary game in our eyes.

247
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:42,547
Speaker 0: Like if I'll play a game 10 times, that is like an S tier game.

248
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:44,231
Speaker 0: That is amazing.

249
00:16:44,652 --> 00:16:47,377
Speaker 0: Even more than once is a big hurdle.

250
00:16:47,397 --> 00:16:48,480
Speaker 0: A lot of games have to get over.

251
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:52,433
Speaker 0: And yet I think most people who that I played it do play a hundred times.

252
00:16:53,196 --> 00:16:54,100
Speaker 0: That says something.

253
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:59,327
Speaker 1: I think the most people I know who play Catan end up playing it many, many times.

254
00:16:59,587 --> 00:16:59,788
Speaker 1: Right.

255
00:16:59,908 --> 00:17:09,000
Speaker 1: Like people go through a phase like Catan is their thing and they keep playing it a bunch, which is something I don't see for other really popular games.

256
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:17,220
Speaker 1: Like, you know, like, you know, a lot of people have bought copies of root, like I've heard from, you know, the listener that it's like selling out constantly.

257
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,286
Speaker 1: And like you can't get it in a lot of places.

258
00:17:19,386 --> 00:17:23,940
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's like any time it comes out like they, you know, it's like it sells quickly.

259
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:28,707
Speaker 1: But yet how many people are playing root many, many times?

260
00:17:28,807 --> 00:17:29,769
Speaker 0: I want to.

261
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:34,720
Speaker 0: And now that now that the pan doodle is in the long tail, I feel like I want to make that happen.

262
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:39,473
Speaker 1: But I'm saying is like I think a lot of people have root clearly because it sold a lot of copies.

263
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,920
Speaker 1: A lot of people have wingspan because it sold a lot of copies.

264
00:17:42,481 --> 00:17:46,593
Speaker 1: But at least I don't have any data, so I could just be wrong and completely bullshitting.

265
00:17:46,673 --> 00:17:49,200
Speaker 1: But my feeling is that people aren't playing.

266
00:17:49,641 --> 00:17:55,720
Speaker 1: If they have wingspan, people aren't playing wingspan constantly and making it like a thing and playing it a whole bunch.

267
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:59,266
Speaker 1: They're playing it occasionally, you know, a few times.

268
00:17:59,807 --> 00:18:06,680
Speaker 1: But I see lots of people who when they become Settlers people, then they go through a phase of playing it a fuckton.

269
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:10,865
Speaker 0: I think games that trigger that are extremely rare.

270
00:18:10,885 --> 00:18:15,450
Speaker 0: And there's some like I struggle to define exactly what it is.

271
00:18:15,471 --> 00:18:23,280
Speaker 0: There's like this sweet spot of interaction and politics and mechanics that I would have to spend some time thinking about to try to identify what it is.

272
00:18:24,081 --> 00:18:25,324
Speaker 0: But T&E does that for me.

273
00:18:25,344 --> 00:18:28,071
Speaker 0: Hans and Toytonica actually does that for me.

274
00:18:28,091 --> 00:18:31,820
Speaker 0: A lot of trick taking games do and the list is running out fast.

275
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:46,400
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is, is that Klaus, the gentleman who made Settlers, we have much to thank him for and it is sad that he has departed from the world of the living.

276
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:48,122
Speaker 0: Yup.

277
00:18:48,142 --> 00:18:49,364
Speaker 0: Four went out for a legend.

278
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,931
Speaker 0: And one last little news on an upbeat.

279
00:18:52,991 --> 00:18:56,838
Speaker 0: So you might remember there was a Dungeons and Dragons movie a long time ago and we'll never speak of it again.

280
00:18:56,898 --> 00:18:57,660
Speaker 0: I never actually saw it.

281
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,622
Speaker 1: There's the one that we saw in the theater.

282
00:19:01,243 --> 00:19:02,265
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did not go.

283
00:19:02,846 --> 00:19:03,126
Speaker 1: Okay.

284
00:19:03,246 --> 00:19:04,107
Speaker 0: I was not there.

285
00:19:04,528 --> 00:19:05,469
Speaker 0: I refused to go.

286
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:06,711
Speaker 0: You all went anyway.

287
00:19:06,831 --> 00:19:07,833
Speaker 0: And I was like, it's going to be bad.

288
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:09,175
Speaker 1: I went knowing it would be garbage.

289
00:19:09,255 --> 00:19:09,675
Speaker 1: And it was.

290
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:11,839
Speaker 1: I don't remember much about it, though.

291
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:12,820
Speaker 1: Other than that, it was garbage.

292
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,623
Speaker 0: I stayed home and played Counter Strike.

293
00:19:14,763 --> 00:19:15,405
Speaker 0: Like, I remember.

294
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,509
Speaker 0: It was forgettable, right?

295
00:19:17,609 --> 00:19:19,212
Speaker 0: You all came back and I was like, how was it?

296
00:19:19,272 --> 00:19:20,695
Speaker 0: And you were like, and then that was.

297
00:19:20,715 --> 00:19:23,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I knew it was gonna be before I went.

298
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:25,243
Speaker 1: It wasn't like.

299
00:19:25,283 --> 00:19:26,104
Speaker 1: I was disappointed.

300
00:19:27,826 --> 00:19:32,232
Speaker 1: So, weren't there other D&D, besides the cartoon, right?

301
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:34,294
Speaker 1: Weren't there other D&D movies?

302
00:19:34,394 --> 00:19:35,996
Speaker 1: Like, there was definitely that video.

303
00:19:36,037 --> 00:19:37,118
Speaker 1: choose your own adventure one.

304
00:19:37,158 --> 00:19:37,879
Speaker 0: That doesn't count.

305
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:38,720
Speaker 1: Okay.

306
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,404
Speaker 0: I don't actually know.

307
00:19:41,424 --> 00:19:44,489
Speaker 0: I can only think of the two that are legit movies.

308
00:19:44,529 --> 00:19:47,493
Speaker 0: If there was another one, I'm unaware of it or I'm stupid.

309
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,737
Speaker 0: We both forgot it and the listener is going to make fun of us.

310
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,439
Speaker 0: But I can't think of one.

311
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,361
Speaker 0: So, the new D&D movie.

312
00:19:54,381 --> 00:19:56,484
Speaker 1: So, I go on IMDB, for example.

313
00:19:56,645 --> 00:19:56,925
Speaker 1: Yeah.

314
00:19:57,185 --> 00:19:58,487
Speaker 1: Right?

315
00:19:58,667 --> 00:20:00,089
Speaker 1: Are these books or are these movies?

316
00:20:00,170 --> 00:20:00,530
Speaker 1: Hold on.

317
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:04,696
Speaker 0: So, while you look that up, to explain, there is a new Dungeons and Dragons movie.

318
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,298
Speaker 1: Oh, it's a television movie.

319
00:20:06,679 --> 00:20:07,600
Speaker 1: The TV movies.

320
00:20:08,081 --> 00:20:09,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, it can't count TV movies.

321
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:10,527
Speaker 0: That's a rabbit hole that goes forever.

322
00:20:10,547 --> 00:20:11,971
Speaker 1: But there were other things that existed.

323
00:20:12,011 --> 00:20:13,154
Speaker 1: But yeah, in terms of theatrical movies.

324
00:20:13,174 --> 00:20:15,540
Speaker 0: If we talk about TV movies, there were like six Lost Boys movies.

325
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:27,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I guess in terms of theatrical movies, there was just the year 2000 Dungeons and Dragons that we saw.

326
00:20:27,294 --> 00:20:29,537
Speaker 1: And then the new one, which is 23 years later.

327
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:31,440
Speaker 1: The honor among thieves one.

328
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,162
Speaker 0: So, how's it doing?

329
00:20:34,184 --> 00:20:37,348
Speaker 0: It knocked Janwick 4 and Scream 4 out of the box office.

330
00:20:37,548 --> 00:20:39,811
Speaker 0: It is crazy popular so far.

331
00:20:40,112 --> 00:20:41,053
Speaker 0: The reviews come in and are saying it's great.

332
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,316
Speaker 1: Yeah, and people have said positive things about it.

333
00:20:43,416 --> 00:20:45,980
Speaker 1: But my expectations are still the same.

334
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,623
Speaker 0: Mine are pretty high because I think what's going on here.

335
00:20:48,643 --> 00:20:52,087
Speaker 0: Because I don't usually read reviews of movies until after I see them.

336
00:20:52,187 --> 00:20:53,609
Speaker 0: And I do plan to see this movie.

337
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:56,633
Speaker 0: But full disclosure, I have a lot of Hasbro stock.

338
00:20:57,254 --> 00:20:58,795
Speaker 0: And I'm curious.

339
00:20:58,996 --> 00:20:59,997
Speaker 0: I read a bunch of reviews.

340
00:21:00,618 --> 00:21:02,620
Speaker 0: And what people seem to be saying is interesting.

341
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:13,513
Speaker 0: So you know how the things that are the D&D media that are popular are like acting and critical role and all these like D&D play shows like they're popular among certain set of people.

342
00:21:14,154 --> 00:21:17,939
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan of these things, but I understand why people are nothing wrong with these things like.

343
00:21:17,959 --> 00:21:18,540
Speaker 0: I want to be clear.

344
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:27,499
Speaker 0: But I think what people wanted from a D&D movie is for it to be an evolved form of what they think it feels like to play D&D.

345
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:30,282
Speaker 0: Which means sometimes it's serious.

346
00:21:30,643 --> 00:21:31,724
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's funny.

347
00:21:32,184 --> 00:21:38,410
Speaker 0: D&D type shit happens like the heist goes wrong or a dragon shows up at the wrong time or you burn the town down.

348
00:21:38,971 --> 00:21:41,534
Speaker 0: And I get the impression this movie is that.

349
00:21:41,914 --> 00:21:44,496
Speaker 0: It's the funny, weird, like.

350
00:21:44,617 --> 00:21:48,060
Speaker 0: this is obviously very directly a D&D game happening.

351
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:49,923
Speaker 1: You mean the live action slayers?

352
00:21:49,984 --> 00:21:50,605
Speaker 1: Is that what it is?

353
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:57,787
Speaker 1: They did.

354
00:21:57,827 --> 00:21:58,539
Speaker 1: It was called Slayers.

355
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:04,190
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of Slayers we haven't watched that we should probably catch up on at some point.

356
00:22:04,571 --> 00:22:05,774
Speaker 0: You and Emily never saw Try.

357
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:08,360
Speaker 0: I still have DVDs that we borrowed from Laura.

358
00:22:10,782 --> 00:22:11,471
Speaker 0: Slayers is great.

359
00:22:11,552 --> 00:22:12,119
Speaker 0: You love Slayers.

360
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:12,941
Speaker 1: Yeah.

361
00:22:13,182 --> 00:22:14,731
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm only going to live so long.

362
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:16,380
Speaker 1: How much time do I want to spend watching Slayers?

363
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:20,980
Speaker 0: There's like 26 episodes of Try and like what, 13 are the one that came after Try?

364
00:22:21,622 --> 00:22:22,593
Speaker 1: What could I do with those 13 hours?

365
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:26,613
Speaker 0: Play four games of Everdell.

366
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:27,260
Speaker 0: Anyway.

367
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,578
Speaker 1: You keep going on about this Everdell.

368
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,024
Speaker 0: It's a good game.

369
00:22:31,064 --> 00:22:33,300
Speaker 0: Just takes too long unless you have the right people at the table.

370
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,180
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

371
00:22:37,801 --> 00:22:40,832
Speaker 0: So got a little thing, not gaming related, but it's a channel.

372
00:22:40,872 --> 00:22:41,755
Speaker 0: I found that's great.

373
00:22:41,836 --> 00:22:42,940
Speaker 0: It's a YouTube short channel.

374
00:22:43,321 --> 00:22:47,254
Speaker 0: And all it is, is this woman who knows about cooking.

375
00:22:47,334 --> 00:22:49,020
Speaker 0: I looked at her other stuff and she used to be a chef.

376
00:22:49,701 --> 00:23:02,540
Speaker 0: But all she does is comment on a certain genre of cooking video that I'm going to describe as white people who have no idea how to cook sharing their absolutely terrifying recipes.

377
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:06,300
Speaker 1: I've noticed this genre lately as well in the video short category.

378
00:23:07,342 --> 00:23:08,169
Speaker 1: YouTube shorts.

379
00:23:08,391 --> 00:23:09,460
Speaker 1: It's, you know, whatever.

380
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,191
Speaker 0: It's really easy to make them with the app.

381
00:23:11,211 --> 00:23:12,279
Speaker 0: That's why people are making them.

382
00:23:12,862 --> 00:23:16,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, I noticed this whole genre of person who actually knows about something.

383
00:23:17,341 --> 00:23:17,641
Speaker 1: Right.

384
00:23:18,182 --> 00:23:27,220
Speaker 1: Looks at they watch a short video of someone messing around trying to make a viral video who doesn't know what they're doing and they comment on it.

385
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:27,420
Speaker 1: Right.

386
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,984
Speaker 1: So I've seen a mostly for cooking.

387
00:23:29,044 --> 00:23:35,360
Speaker 1: It's like someone does some wild cooking and the person watching it is like, yeah, this is a bunch of bullshit.

388
00:23:36,264 --> 00:23:37,591
Speaker 0: The chef is just watching, being quiet.

389
00:23:37,611 --> 00:23:39,420
Speaker 0: Then he's like, that's going to spread salmonella.

390
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:40,641
Speaker 1: Right.

391
00:23:40,661 --> 00:23:48,260
Speaker 1: But on YouTube shorts, there's someone who does it for like hardware projects and they're like, yeah, this person is making a finger removing device.

392
00:23:50,323 --> 00:23:52,711
Speaker 1: And like they actually know about hardware and they're like, all right.

393
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:54,538
Speaker 1: So that person invented the screwdriver.

394
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:55,060
Speaker 1: Congrats.

395
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,860
Speaker 1: They're like just making fun of people doing dumb stuff.

396
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:03,820
Speaker 0: But I guess what I like about this one is, I mean, the videos are terrifying and her commentary is great.

397
00:24:04,101 --> 00:24:09,820
Speaker 0: But the format she presents is that she just describes what they're doing directly.

398
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,420
Speaker 0: And you can hear the sarcasm just like oozing through the way she's described what they're doing.

399
00:24:17,661 --> 00:24:18,652
Speaker 0: Like, oh, yeah, you don't need to stir.

400
00:24:18,672 --> 00:24:19,359
Speaker 0: That is fine.

401
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:26,400
Speaker 1: Well, I guess if you like geek nights, sarcasm, you'll like that sarcasm as well.

402
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:28,298
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

403
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:38,460
Speaker 1: So on the right now, Resident Evil 4, an old game is so hot right now because the remake is out.

404
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:38,840
Speaker 1: Right.

405
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:46,080
Speaker 1: The basically, you know, I think Capcom has a really good thing going with the way they handle Resident Evil, which is where they've got new games coming.

406
00:24:46,681 --> 00:24:46,922
Speaker 1: Right.

407
00:24:47,103 --> 00:24:51,099
Speaker 1: And then they sort of cycle through redoing the old game.

408
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:52,063
Speaker 1: Right.

409
00:24:52,445 --> 00:24:55,320
Speaker 1: This sort of in wave is like a wave that comes up.

410
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:55,641
Speaker 1: Right.

411
00:24:55,661 --> 00:24:57,428
Speaker 1: So it's like they went one, two, three, four.

412
00:24:57,890 --> 00:25:00,118
Speaker 1: And the newest one is what, eight, I think, or not.

413
00:25:00,158 --> 00:25:00,520
Speaker 1: I don't know.

414
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,684
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

415
00:25:02,406 --> 00:25:04,555
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm actually going back through the back catalog.

416
00:25:04,575 --> 00:25:05,859
Speaker 0: I just started replaying four.

417
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:09,088
Speaker 1: I've actually played almost.

418
00:25:09,228 --> 00:25:12,700
Speaker 1: I haven't played the newest one, but I think I've played six or seven of the rest.

419
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:13,724
Speaker 1: I played about most of them.

420
00:25:13,764 --> 00:25:16,276
Speaker 0: Basically, I played two, three, part of four, part of five.

421
00:25:16,316 --> 00:25:17,220
Speaker 0: And honestly, that's it.

422
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,263
Speaker 0: I never played one.

423
00:25:18,363 --> 00:25:20,229
Speaker 1: I think I've done at least one through.

424
00:25:20,289 --> 00:25:24,120
Speaker 1: I know I've done up to five, I think six and maybe seven.

425
00:25:24,581 --> 00:25:25,063
Speaker 1: I don't know what.

426
00:25:25,123 --> 00:25:27,091
Speaker 0: I've never actually played Resident Evil one.

427
00:25:28,115 --> 00:25:29,098
Speaker 1: Oh, I beat Resident Evil one.

428
00:25:29,961 --> 00:25:35,260
Speaker 1: But I played Resident Evil one many times, but I didn't beat it until there was the remake.

429
00:25:36,202 --> 00:25:38,076
Speaker 1: It's way more playable than the original.

430
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:38,519
Speaker 0: That's it.

431
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:42,897
Speaker 0: The remakes are a lot of quality of life improvements in these games.

432
00:25:43,239 --> 00:25:43,540
Speaker 1: Many.

433
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, because especially because a lot of them are sort of hard to play.

434
00:25:46,449 --> 00:25:49,660
Speaker 1: But the thing is they remade four and it's like, OK, good.

435
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,351
Speaker 1: You remade four, but four didn't really need the quality of life improvement.

436
00:25:53,391 --> 00:25:54,254
Speaker 0: The original is like.

437
00:25:54,274 --> 00:25:56,140
Speaker 0: the original original was fine to play.

438
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,708
Speaker 1: Like four is playable, right?

439
00:25:57,849 --> 00:25:59,338
Speaker 1: One, two and three needed the help.

440
00:25:59,579 --> 00:25:59,700
Speaker 1: Right.

441
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,746
Speaker 1: I played remakes of those to actually beat them.

442
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:06,100
Speaker 1: But four doesn't is very playable without the help.

443
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:07,649
Speaker 1: But the help is welcome.

444
00:26:08,072 --> 00:26:09,500
Speaker 1: You know, it's not unwelcome.

445
00:26:10,284 --> 00:26:13,399
Speaker 1: But anyway, they're promoting the fact the remake of four is out now.

446
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:18,440
Speaker 1: And they made these cute little one minute like chibi animations.

447
00:26:19,721 --> 00:26:21,028
Speaker 1: And so far there's three of them.

448
00:26:21,289 --> 00:26:21,812
Speaker 1: I'm only good.

449
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,220
Speaker 1: We can link to just the first one.

450
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:31,420
Speaker 1: I trust the listener is smart enough, if they enjoy it, to go to the YouTube channel and find the other videos that are in the same series.

451
00:26:31,701 --> 00:26:34,580
Speaker 1: Because the YouTube channel has other Capcom related videos as well.

452
00:26:35,062 --> 00:26:36,346
Speaker 1: But you're intelligent enough.

453
00:26:36,426 --> 00:26:37,269
Speaker 1: I know you can do it.

454
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:39,355
Speaker 1: I don't need to provide you all the links, right?

455
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:40,680
Speaker 1: One is enough.

456
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,420
Speaker 0: These are just perfect.

457
00:26:43,280 --> 00:26:48,020
Speaker 1: It's just these really cute one minute videos that are like, yeah, they're ads for the Resident Evil 4 remake.

458
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:54,040
Speaker 1: Yes, they're ads, but they are very cute one minute little chibi animations that are really funny and cute.

459
00:26:54,864 --> 00:26:58,440
Speaker 1: And also I think they work well for Resident Evil 4.

460
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:08,120
Speaker 1: Because I think having played most of the Resident Evils, 4 has the most straightforward, comprehensible, understandable, relatable story.

461
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,165
Speaker 0: I've watched people play most of the Resident Evils.

462
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:15,080
Speaker 0: And yeah, absolutely from the watching people play them on livestreams or on a couch.

463
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:18,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, 4 makes sense-ish.

464
00:27:18,942 --> 00:27:22,412
Speaker 1: I mean, it's literally like, go rescue the president's daughter.

465
00:27:22,833 --> 00:27:25,040
Speaker 1: It's so straightforward compared to the other ones.

466
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:29,259
Speaker 1: Where it's like there's more mystery or what, you know, it's like, this is what it is.

467
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:33,660
Speaker 1: Where it's like, you know, 6 or whatever is like, what the fuck is going on here?

468
00:27:37,061 --> 00:27:41,300
Speaker 0: In about a moment, the Geek Guys Book Club book is Sam and Rushdie's The Satanic Versus.

469
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:46,480
Speaker 1: Ah, so I went to the library to get this book.

470
00:27:48,722 --> 00:27:53,357
Speaker 1: And I got a cool limited edition time special edition Mets library card.

471
00:27:53,377 --> 00:27:54,100
Speaker 1: they just came out with.

472
00:27:55,460 --> 00:27:56,363
Speaker 1: And then I got the book.

473
00:27:57,466 --> 00:27:59,252
Speaker 1: And the book is like 500 pages.

474
00:27:59,272 --> 00:28:01,017
Speaker 1: And I have to return the book by April 20th.

475
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:08,440
Speaker 1: And I have to read, I calculated, 30 pages per day-ish to finish the book by then.

476
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,783
Speaker 1: I guess I can renew it.

477
00:28:10,385 --> 00:28:13,453
Speaker 1: But, you know, have I read 30 pages per day?

478
00:28:13,473 --> 00:28:14,856
Speaker 1: I'm a little behind.

479
00:28:14,897 --> 00:28:15,378
Speaker 1: I'm like 100 pages in.

480
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,619
Speaker 0: But it's still a good target date to shoot for.

481
00:28:19,240 --> 00:28:19,461
Speaker 1: Right.

482
00:28:19,481 --> 00:28:23,760
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's like I can even though I'm like behind, it's like I can still calculate.

483
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,968
Speaker 1: Well, it's been 8x days.

484
00:28:26,048 --> 00:28:27,313
Speaker 1: Like let's say it's been 8 days.

485
00:28:27,654 --> 00:28:30,421
Speaker 1: I know that I need to be on page 240.

486
00:28:30,421 --> 00:28:34,234
Speaker 1: So I could just, I know like where my target is at all times.

487
00:28:34,375 --> 00:28:35,780
Speaker 1: And like I know I'm behind it right now.

488
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:38,250
Speaker 1: But I'm still reading it every day.

489
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,499
Speaker 1: Like trying to catch up to the target.

490
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,588
Speaker 0: But also we have entered a critical season.

491
00:28:42,648 --> 00:28:45,060
Speaker 0: The season of I can go lay in the park and read.

492
00:28:45,862 --> 00:28:47,920
Speaker 1: Well, it's going to get colder I guess next week.

493
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did bike home today.

494
00:28:49,167 --> 00:28:50,417
Speaker 0: It was like 72 when I left the office.

495
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,720
Speaker 1: Today is, yeah, today is the, it's all, it's somewhat warm.

496
00:28:55,602 --> 00:28:58,612
Speaker 1: Instead of being a little cold, it's now somewhat warm.

497
00:28:58,632 --> 00:29:00,880
Speaker 1: But not warm enough, but somewhat warm.

498
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:01,940
Speaker 0: It's warm enough to bike.

499
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,324
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh yeah.

500
00:29:03,545 --> 00:29:05,760
Speaker 1: Definitely warm enough for biking right now, for sure.

501
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was hard to bike home because everybody took every city bike in midtown.

502
00:29:10,621 --> 00:29:22,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm reading this book and the only thing I can say about this book is that I do not have enough knowledge about the Quran to understand a lot of what is going on.

503
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:30,780
Speaker 1: I mean like I understand what's happening, but I just can't understand like what is a, what is a reference or retelling and what is original.

504
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:33,320
Speaker 1: Because I don't know the original story.

505
00:29:33,641 --> 00:29:43,060
Speaker 0: Have you ever read any of, or seen, there's a lot of stories, a bunch of them, all written by all different people that are basically an angel and a devil, but they're kind of friends.

506
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:47,860
Speaker 1: Yes, I've read many of those, right Neil Gaiman, right Good Omens and all, you know.

507
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,862
Speaker 0: That's the part to focus on.

508
00:29:48,963 --> 00:29:52,472
Speaker 0: I don't know if knowledge of the Quran will help or hinder.

509
00:29:52,492 --> 00:29:55,320
Speaker 0: I think we're going to have a lot to say about this book.

510
00:29:56,600 --> 00:30:00,960
Speaker 1: But it's like, damn it, I kind of, it's like it makes me want to stop and read the Quran and come back.

511
00:30:03,185 --> 00:30:05,630
Speaker 1: Or maybe I can get a Cliffs Notes Quran somewhere.

512
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,080
Speaker 1: It's not like I've read, it's not like I've read, it's not like I've read the Old or New Testaments either.

513
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:14,940
Speaker 1: I just know like, you know, the basics like, you know, Genesis, Exodus, whatever.

514
00:30:15,921 --> 00:30:19,080
Speaker 1: So I just, I just need that same outline, you know, idea.

515
00:30:20,340 --> 00:30:30,300
Speaker 1: Because clearly, right, the story of, there is some original story of Muhammad in the Satanic Verses that I feel like I gotta know in order to fully understand.

516
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:39,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know, I'll admit, I only know the historical context of that particular debate, well I shouldn't say debate, that particular point of contention.

517
00:30:39,500 --> 00:30:46,080
Speaker 0: Because it was crucial to why the government of Iran wants the author of this book dead to this day.

518
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, all I know is that they want him dead.

519
00:30:48,988 --> 00:30:51,600
Speaker 1: I didn't understand the theological reasons.

520
00:30:51,881 --> 00:31:01,920
Speaker 0: It's because of that, but really it was a, the book came out at the right time for Iran's government to stir up some shit for tangentially related political reasons.

521
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:10,360
Speaker 1: I'm just saying my theological knowledge is admittedly extremely lacking, there's no reason to even hide that fact, right?

522
00:31:10,921 --> 00:31:26,600
Speaker 1: And I believe, you know, while I fully understand what is happening in the book, I feel like I am missing on many, you know, allegories, references, symbolisms because of my lack of knowledge of some referenced source material.

523
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,292
Speaker 0: Well we'll see how we progress, and if we read some theology in between parts of this book, we'll let you know.

524
00:31:32,372 --> 00:31:36,340
Speaker 0: so you have a good bead on how we're progressing and how you should progress if you're reading along.

525
00:31:38,561 --> 00:31:41,978
Speaker 0: And otherwise, I think we got no cons coming up for a while, so...

526
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:42,961
Speaker 1: Summer time.

527
00:31:43,001 --> 00:31:49,195
Speaker 1: It used to be summer was like stacked cons, like cons every weekend, and now it's like summer is the no cons season.

528
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,260
Speaker 1: Everyone moved their cons out of the summer.

529
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,349
Speaker 0: I'm going to a Star Trek con in May in Philly.

530
00:31:54,369 --> 00:31:57,740
Speaker 0: I don't think Scott is interested, but if you want to go, we're driving there.

531
00:31:58,541 --> 00:32:00,198
Speaker 1: I'm not interested in the Star Trek con.

532
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:02,589
Speaker 0: We might hang out at Schojo's house the day after it.

533
00:32:02,609 --> 00:32:02,930
Speaker 0: We'll see.

534
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,316
Speaker 0: We're playing it by ear.

535
00:32:04,356 --> 00:32:05,180
Speaker 0: We got to make our plans.

536
00:32:06,901 --> 00:32:13,420
Speaker 0: Looking at Kinetic Con, but might overlap with other plans we're making, so I don't know if we want to, but even then, that's already a ways from now.

537
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:16,143
Speaker 0: That's like July.

538
00:32:16,644 --> 00:32:18,309
Speaker 0: So yeah, stay tuned on what we're doing.

539
00:32:18,610 --> 00:32:22,160
Speaker 0: You might see some more non-convention content.

540
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,230
Speaker 0: I got video that Scott shared from the PAX East.

541
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:25,853
Speaker 0: we were just at.

542
00:32:25,893 --> 00:32:27,920
Speaker 0: that will be turned into some YouTube stuff soon.

543
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:33,849
Speaker 0: And also, I'll just note that I have been trying to put at least one YouTube short.

544
00:32:34,049 --> 00:32:40,920
Speaker 0: that is a succinct point cut out of one of our many, many Geek Nights panels from over the years onto YouTube about once a day.

545
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:44,425
Speaker 0: And they're getting a lot of views, so if you like this content, let me know.

546
00:32:44,445 --> 00:32:53,120
Speaker 0: If you have any thoughts on it, I'm evolving how to make these better based on which ones get views, which ones don't, which ones get likes, which ones don't.

547
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:59,059
Speaker 0: And right now, there's some pretty clear trends that are actually helping me make these better and make a faster pipeline to just crank them out.

548
00:33:01,662 --> 00:33:06,176
Speaker 1: I guess the only thing I really have tickets to right now besides playoff hockey...

549
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,644
Speaker 0: Well, I got regular hockey tomorrow.

550
00:33:09,045 --> 00:33:13,176
Speaker 0: Oh, and Nick Cave is going to be performing in New York in September.

551
00:33:13,237 --> 00:33:14,360
Speaker 0: I'm getting fucking tickets to that.

552
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:20,360
Speaker 0: And I'm planning to go to a lot of live music over the next six months.

553
00:33:20,982 --> 00:33:28,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, we bought tickets to see, you know, after we went, you know, I think, did I talk about the Dreamcatcher disappointing K-pop concert?

554
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,540
Speaker 0: Yes, you did when I talked about the last Rockstars.

555
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:41,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, but the Mama Moo is the, like, I've never seen them live because they've only been in the US a few times and with very short performances.

556
00:33:42,241 --> 00:33:53,880
Speaker 1: But it is well known and well documented on YouTube that they are, like, in terms of K-pop groups, they're absolutely the best live K-pop group there probably is ever, right?

557
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:58,600
Speaker 1: Probably even better than BTS in terms of the performance on stage live.

558
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:03,411
Speaker 1: And they have a US tour now after so long, right?

559
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:04,193
Speaker 1: After how many years?

560
00:34:04,213 --> 00:34:06,420
Speaker 1: They've been around, like, nine years at least, right?

561
00:34:06,881 --> 00:34:08,204
Speaker 1: They finally have a US tour.

562
00:34:08,565 --> 00:34:15,540
Speaker 1: We paid the big money to sit, like, close because it's in the UBS arena where the Islanders play, at least the New York one is.

563
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:18,545
Speaker 1: And it sold out, like, immediately.

564
00:34:19,047 --> 00:34:23,100
Speaker 1: But then they opened up the 200s and the 300s and now it's not even sold out.

565
00:34:23,159 --> 00:34:27,929
Speaker 1: And you can buy, I think, you can get a cheap ticket for, like, what, 60 bucks, right?

566
00:34:28,812 --> 00:34:32,239
Speaker 1: So, I would recommend, right?

567
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:32,833
Speaker 0: Yeah.

568
00:34:34,527 --> 00:34:34,920
Speaker 1: All right.

569
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,648
Speaker 1: Even if you don't care at all, right?

570
00:34:36,708 --> 00:34:38,659
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, the performance is just so good.

571
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,603
Speaker 0: We did a Geek Knives on live music a while back.

572
00:34:40,623 --> 00:34:47,480
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll link to that because TL;DL, live music is just great even if you're not a super fan of that music most of the time.

573
00:34:48,101 --> 00:34:50,306
Speaker 1: It's on a Tuesday, May 16th.

574
00:34:50,407 --> 00:34:52,212
Speaker 1: But, look, they have a whole US tour.

575
00:34:52,292 --> 00:34:55,260
Speaker 1: So, depending on where you are, you know, somewhere else.

576
00:34:56,341 --> 00:34:58,539
Speaker 1: And I bet everywhere else is a lot cheaper than New York, too.

577
00:34:59,561 --> 00:35:06,140
Speaker 0: So, it's been a while since we've reviewed a new tabletop game because for some reason we haven't been able to get together with people and play board games or go to cons for a while.

578
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,624
Speaker 0: But, here we are.

579
00:35:09,246 --> 00:35:10,168
Speaker 0: We were at PAX East.

580
00:35:10,388 --> 00:35:11,310
Speaker 0: We played a few games.

581
00:35:11,330 --> 00:35:15,680
Speaker 0: There was that chili sauce distilling game that we could probably do a show on because I liked it.

582
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,980
Speaker 0: But I think I want to play it one more time before I pass judgment on it.

583
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:22,368
Speaker 0: But Cat in the Box needed two plays for us to review it.

584
00:35:22,989 --> 00:35:27,200
Speaker 0: And I cannot imagine that more play will change my opinion of this game.

585
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:32,799
Speaker 0: It will probably change my heuristics and, like, I'll figure out how to be good at it.

586
00:35:33,440 --> 00:35:42,800
Speaker 0: But Cat in the Box is such an elegant, well-designed, trick-taking game that I'm just gonna say it's S tier right now.

587
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,179
Speaker 0: I bought a copy, like, immediately after I got home from PAX.

588
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,843
Speaker 1: I mean, it's up there, right?

589
00:35:47,344 --> 00:35:53,820
Speaker 1: So, we played a lot of trick-taking games, especially a lot of the small Japanese ones that seem to be a whole trend, right?

590
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,203
Speaker 1: You know, we've talked about.

591
00:35:55,263 --> 00:36:03,220
Speaker 1: there's the scared ghost one and there's the Haifu one and, you know, there's just so many, right?

592
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:08,399
Speaker 1: And there's the classic ones, you know, your wizards, tarts, spades, wist, all those.

593
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:14,611
Speaker 1: Anyway, but this one is really different in terms of what Rim just said.

594
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:16,115
Speaker 1: The level of polish.

595
00:36:16,215 --> 00:36:18,400
Speaker 1: It is so streamlined and so straightforward.

596
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:27,279
Speaker 1: It doesn't have any, like, weird gotchas or anything, you know, like, "Oh, you can only trump on the second moon of the third

597
00:36:27,299 --> 00:36:27,500
Speaker 1: moon.".

598
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:29,536
Speaker 1: There's no weird anything.

599
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:36,018
Speaker 0: If you have formed a coalition with the player who chose the trump, then the other coalition forms the alternate trump, like, moon.

600
00:36:36,058 --> 00:36:36,640
Speaker 0: None of that crap.

601
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:44,854
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like a lot of trick-taking games, even ones that are pretty smooth, they have one little quirk, at least one, like, quirk or gotcha.

602
00:36:44,895 --> 00:36:47,820
Speaker 1: that makes them a little rough rules-wise, right?

603
00:36:48,560 --> 00:36:59,780
Speaker 1: Even if they have something, you know, and some of them, which I think are smooth, don't have, like, a strategy or a, you know, anything to crunch your brain on decision-wise.

604
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,443
Speaker 1: Like, they're just sort of straightforward.

605
00:37:01,483 --> 00:37:08,500
Speaker 1: Like, you draw your hand, it's easy to figure out the best way to play that hand, and you win or lose based on the draw.

606
00:37:09,420 --> 00:37:11,946
Speaker 0: Now, sometimes that becomes crunchy.

607
00:37:12,046 --> 00:37:15,214
Speaker 0: if you get good at the game and start counting, or, you know, like, you gain some skill.

608
00:37:15,514 --> 00:37:17,940
Speaker 0: Sometimes they become crunchy until you're good at the game.

609
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:25,680
Speaker 0: But, uh, I guess we're about to describe the rules, because the game is so simple, but what I'll say is- The game is so simple, I can teach you the entire rules, and I will do so.

610
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:37,380
Speaker 0: Yep, but a point before, uh, I have rarely seen a trick-taking game that is so quick to teach to a table where nobody makes a mistake.

611
00:37:37,900 --> 00:37:42,980
Speaker 0: Like, goddamn, did everyone understand how to play this game after about three minutes of instruction.

612
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,520
Speaker 1: Especially because you already had some trick-taking knowledge.

613
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:45,937
Speaker 1: Yeah.

614
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,760
Speaker 1: But even if you don't, I think you could learn it very quickly.

615
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,840
Speaker 0: Like, I like Nekozu Dice, but this is like a breath of fresh air.

616
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:52,441
Speaker 1: Right.

617
00:37:52,661 --> 00:37:56,425
Speaker 1: The only reason- like, this could be someone's first trick-taking game.

618
00:37:56,926 --> 00:38:08,980
Speaker 1: The only reason I think you wouldn't want it to be is because the genius of it shines when you have the understanding of a trick-taking game and you see how this is a twist on that formula.

619
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:12,305
Speaker 1: And it's sort of like you can appreciate it, right?

620
00:38:12,345 --> 00:38:20,000
Speaker 1: Whereas if you could just play this, never having taken a trick in your life, but you wouldn't have a full appreciation for what they've done here.

621
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:23,342
Speaker 1: So how does this game work?

622
00:38:23,383 --> 00:38:24,044
Speaker 1: It's really simple.

623
00:38:24,484 --> 00:38:30,473
Speaker 1: There's a deck of cards, numbered one through nine, and every number, there are five copies.

624
00:38:30,634 --> 00:38:33,678
Speaker 1: So five ones, five twos, five nines, right?

625
00:38:33,698 --> 00:38:34,680
Speaker 1: There's forty-five cards.

626
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:34,996
Speaker 1: Yep.

627
00:38:35,742 --> 00:38:38,220
Speaker 1: And you deal out the cards to all the players.

628
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:41,211
Speaker 0: It's very important to note, these cards are all the same.

629
00:38:41,252 --> 00:38:42,156
Speaker 0: All the fives are the same.

630
00:38:42,176 --> 00:38:42,860
Speaker 0: They're all just black.

631
00:38:43,281 --> 00:38:44,102
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no suits.

632
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:47,646
Speaker 1: It's just numbered one through nine, just deal out the cards.

633
00:38:48,568 --> 00:38:55,978
Speaker 1: And you deal them out, and everyone now has a hand, and everyone picks a card to sort of get rid of, right?

634
00:38:56,038 --> 00:38:57,620
Speaker 1: They just throw it out of the game, basically.

635
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,523
Speaker 1: Let's say I have a one in my hand, and I throw it out.

636
00:39:01,583 --> 00:39:07,009
Speaker 1: Well, now I know that there's only four ones left in the game total, right?

637
00:39:07,049 --> 00:39:17,300
Speaker 1: Because there were five, there could be even less than four, but I know that there are less than five ones available in the total deck because I threw one out, right?

638
00:39:18,121 --> 00:39:22,467
Speaker 1: Okay, and then you start playing a trick-taking game, a very normal trick-taking game.

639
00:39:22,507 --> 00:39:31,980
Speaker 1: You play a card, everyone has to follow suit, whoever has the highest in that suit wins, unless someone didn't have that suit, in which case they can play a different suit.

640
00:39:32,701 --> 00:39:35,725
Speaker 1: If they played the Trump suit, then they would win, right?

641
00:39:35,885 --> 00:39:46,539
Speaker 1: Even against someone who had... It's just basic trick-taking game, nothing weird about it whatsoever, completely normal, not one weird rule at all.

642
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:46,980
Speaker 1: None.

643
00:39:47,441 --> 00:39:50,548
Speaker 1: No special anything, the red suit is Trump.

644
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:55,680
Speaker 1: But wait, didn't you just say that all the cards are all black, there's no suits on them?

645
00:39:55,840 --> 00:40:04,020
Speaker 0: Well, when you play a card, you play it on a little cardboard thing in front of you, and you decide what its suit is at the moment you play it.

646
00:40:04,581 --> 00:40:07,926
Speaker 1: Right, so I play a five, and I say, "This five is

647
00:40:08,647 --> 00:40:08,968
Speaker 1: yellow.".

648
00:40:09,108 --> 00:40:09,789
Speaker 1: I decided it.

649
00:40:09,989 --> 00:40:16,279
Speaker 1: When I play it, at the moment I play it, I decide I can pick any suit I want, and I say, "It's five, yellow, it's

650
00:40:16,299 --> 00:40:16,560
Speaker 1: yellow.".

651
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:25,176
Speaker 1: And what I do when I do that is I take a little marker, and there's a board, and the board has 45 slots on it, one for every card.

652
00:40:25,597 --> 00:40:27,400
Speaker 1: And I put a marker on the yellow five.

653
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:31,847
Speaker 1: Now, someone else might have a five in their hand, and they might want to play it.

654
00:40:32,569 --> 00:40:34,612
Speaker 1: Well, they can, no problem.

655
00:40:34,732 --> 00:40:39,360
Speaker 1: They just can't say it's yellow, because, well, the yellow five already got played.

656
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:46,811
Speaker 0: Because remember, the name of this game, fully, is Cat in the Box, and then subtitle, Quantum Trick-Taking Game.

657
00:40:46,891 --> 00:40:53,480
Speaker 0: Because the rule is, you can only play one real card, meaning a yellow five, there's only one yellow five.

658
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:57,734
Speaker 0: You can't play a card that has already been played, the combo of number and color.

659
00:40:58,015 --> 00:40:59,500
Speaker 0: It's a riff on Schrodinger's Cat.

660
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:00,481
Speaker 1: Yep.

661
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:03,647
Speaker 1: So, everyone goes around playing a trick-taking game.

662
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,290
Speaker 1: So, I play a yellow five, right?

663
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,793
Speaker 1: Well, now it's Rim is to the left of me.

664
00:41:06,813 --> 00:41:10,220
Speaker 1: Alright, so Rim, I guess he has to follow suit.

665
00:41:11,222 --> 00:41:14,113
Speaker 1: So, if he plays a two, he's gotta say yellow.

666
00:41:14,133 --> 00:41:15,237
Speaker 1: He can't be like, "Red

667
00:41:15,338 --> 00:41:15,418
Speaker 1: two.".

668
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:19,853
Speaker 0: Well, I could be red two, but I have to then first say, "Oh, no!

669
00:41:20,275 --> 00:41:21,138
Speaker 0: I'm out of yellow!

670
00:41:21,158 --> 00:41:21,599
Speaker 0: That

671
00:41:21,639 --> 00:41:21,840
Speaker 0: sucks!".

672
00:41:22,322 --> 00:41:27,660
Speaker 0: And then I take a marker off my board, showing that I'm, quote, "out of yellow," and I play some other suits.

673
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:34,540
Speaker 1: Which means that for the rest of that round, Rim can never play another yellow card, because he said he didn't have any yellows left.

674
00:41:35,801 --> 00:41:41,110
Speaker 0: If I desuit myself by just declaring I've desuited, I am tied to that for the rest of the hand.

675
00:41:41,350 --> 00:41:47,100
Speaker 0: And if it turns out that yellow is literally the only play I have left for one of my cards, I'm just effed.

676
00:41:47,821 --> 00:41:49,043
Speaker 1: Right, so that's the final thing.

677
00:41:49,584 --> 00:41:59,320
Speaker 1: You play cards, you decide the suit when you play them, and when you decide the suit, you can only choose a suit for that card that hasn't been played by any other player.

678
00:42:00,001 --> 00:42:05,400
Speaker 1: And you can't choose a suit if you have already declared yourself to be desuited in that, right?

679
00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:18,300
Speaker 1: And then, if someone is in a position where all the cards remaining in their hand have no legal play, then that person has caused a paradox, and they lose, and they get boned, and they lose points.

680
00:42:20,700 --> 00:42:23,828
Speaker 1: Otherwise, everyone gets a point for every trick they took.

681
00:42:25,071 --> 00:42:28,980
Speaker 1: At the beginning of each round, you can bid on how many tricks you think you're gonna take.

682
00:42:29,302 --> 00:42:31,279
Speaker 0: But your options are just like one, two, or three.

683
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:32,942
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can't, right?

684
00:42:32,982 --> 00:42:35,146
Speaker 1: So if you go over three, that doesn't matter.

685
00:42:35,507 --> 00:42:43,020
Speaker 1: But if you hit exactly the bid that you made, then you get bonus points equal to these markers on this.

686
00:42:43,600 --> 00:42:57,480
Speaker 0: So, basically when you play the yellow five, and you put the marker on yellow five, and say later you play a yellow six, or a blue five, or whatever's next to it on that marker board orthogonally.

687
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:09,760
Speaker 0: Your bonus points, if you hit your bid, are the total number of your markers that is largest of a contiguously orthogonally adjacent set.

688
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:15,740
Speaker 0: So if I make a big blob of like eight of them, daddy eight points, and I probably definitely won the entire game, because that's nuts.

689
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:25,100
Speaker 1: Right, but it's like you have an incentive to pick colors, you know, suits, such that your markers on the board are orthogonally adjacent.

690
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:27,768
Speaker 1: So you want to make runs in the same suit.

691
00:43:27,888 --> 00:43:31,680
Speaker 1: You want to be like, I played the yellow four, and the yellow five, and the yellow six.

692
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:38,780
Speaker 1: Or you also want to pick, right, like I played the yellow four, and the blue, well there's two, there's the easy side of the board.

693
00:43:38,800 --> 00:43:43,160
Speaker 0: I was about to say, there's that easy baby mode, and there's a really good mode.

694
00:43:43,581 --> 00:43:51,800
Speaker 1: In the baby mode, everything's lined up, so you can just be like blue four, yellow four, green four, right, blue five, and make a blob that way.

695
00:43:52,181 --> 00:43:58,100
Speaker 1: But in the hard mode, everything's offset a little bit, so you can still make runs like three, four, five in the same suit.

696
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:04,080
Speaker 1: But if it's like, you want to be like blue two, yellow three, green four, that would make a vertical column.

697
00:44:05,482 --> 00:44:11,320
Speaker 0: So the only other rule, and just standard trick taking rule, you can't lead the trump suit unless it's been broken.

698
00:44:11,541 --> 00:44:11,983
Speaker 0: Like that's it.

699
00:44:12,264 --> 00:44:15,520
Speaker 0: And that's a totally normal, that's not a gotcha, that's just a regular old trick taking thing.

700
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:16,220
Speaker 0: Like trick taking 101.

701
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:19,820
Speaker 1: And that's the whole game, you play several rounds, you lose the most points, the end.

702
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:21,563
Speaker 0: And it's great.

703
00:44:23,027 --> 00:44:27,200
Speaker 0: Of the two games we played, I came in second place by one point in the first game, and I won the second game.

704
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:30,111
Speaker 0: But I don't think that was my, the first game.

705
00:44:30,131 --> 00:44:32,260
Speaker 0: that was luck, but I do have some heuristics.

706
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:38,120
Speaker 0: Like there is some skill here, and I think play can evolve based on what I noticed in the two games we played.

707
00:44:38,662 --> 00:44:42,233
Speaker 1: I am ashamed to admit it took me several games to learn.

708
00:44:42,534 --> 00:44:44,400
Speaker 1: the most basic fact is, right?

709
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,439
Speaker 1: And so I'm going to teach it to you so you don't fuck it up.

710
00:44:46,781 --> 00:44:49,259
Speaker 0: Oh, then I'll teach the thing I figured out in game two.

711
00:44:49,940 --> 00:44:53,440
Speaker 1: This is so simple and obvious, I should have figured it out as soon as I heard the rules.

712
00:44:53,580 --> 00:44:55,339
Speaker 1: It took me several games to understand this.

713
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:59,040
Speaker 1: That there are five copies of any number in the deck, right?

714
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:02,815
Speaker 1: And you can only, so there are five fours, right?

715
00:45:03,197 --> 00:45:03,740
Speaker 1: In the whole deck.

716
00:45:04,881 --> 00:45:10,500
Speaker 1: If four fours get played, obviously the fifth one can never be played, otherwise trouble.

717
00:45:11,281 --> 00:45:23,420
Speaker 1: If you start in your opening hand and you've got more than one four or more than one two, and you take one of them and throw it out at the start, then you know the other one is perfectly safe.

718
00:45:23,740 --> 00:45:27,440
Speaker 1: You can always, as long as you don't desuit yourself and stupidly, right?

719
00:45:28,022 --> 00:45:31,580
Speaker 1: You'll know that you can safely play that other one, right?

720
00:45:31,801 --> 00:45:46,211
Speaker 1: So if you draw in your opening hand like three threes, obviously you should probably throw away one of the threes, and now you know for sure those other two threes are safe, and you can just sort of hold them till the end of the round, and you won't paradox that way.

721
00:45:46,473 --> 00:45:47,580
Speaker 1: Try to get all the other cards.

722
00:45:47,680 --> 00:45:52,760
Speaker 1: If you've got like one four in your opening hand, okay, keep it, but try to play it quickly.

723
00:45:53,281 --> 00:46:09,680
Speaker 1: That way you can get it out, and if no one else is thrown away at four, and there's a dangerous paradoxical four out there, at least it's not in your hand, and I paradoxed often when I started playing, and once I understood this, I stopped paradoxing basically.

724
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:13,535
Speaker 0: I only paradoxed once, and it was a negative zero paradox.

725
00:46:13,615 --> 00:46:14,720
Speaker 0: I was okay on that one.

726
00:46:17,022 --> 00:46:26,518
Speaker 0: So my slightly more advanced heuristic that worked so well is kind of like when you showed how you were winning citadels, and everyone was like, "Oh fuck, that's why Scott was

727
00:46:26,538 --> 00:46:26,720
Speaker 0: winning.".

728
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:27,406
Speaker 1: Mine wasn't even a heuristic.

729
00:46:27,426 --> 00:46:29,099
Speaker 1: It was just like a basic fact.

730
00:46:30,122 --> 00:46:31,309
Speaker 1: It was so simple.

731
00:46:31,329 --> 00:46:33,320
Speaker 1: I don't know how I didn't understand that from game one.

732
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:53,460
Speaker 0: My baby heuristic that is the sole reason I won that second game and will definitely not work again was, whatever number every single player played first, unless there was like a weird situation with like, you know, like someone leads something really high first round, whatever they play, I assumed they were trying to get rid of it because they have more than one in their hand.

733
00:46:54,982 --> 00:46:59,540
Speaker 1: No, you would get rid of it early because you don't have more than one in your hand.

734
00:47:00,601 --> 00:47:07,760
Speaker 0: Well no, meaning they have more than one in their hand after throwing stuff away, and they're trying to get rid of the most dangerous card in their hand.

735
00:47:08,520 --> 00:47:12,199
Speaker 1: But if you have multiple numbers of a card in your hand...

736
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,700
Speaker 0: Say you have two fours in your hand after you threw stuff away.

737
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:16,800
Speaker 1: But I would have thrown away one of the fours.

738
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:20,720
Speaker 0: What if you have three fours and three ones when you have to decide what to throw away?

739
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,880
Speaker 1: That's really weird.

740
00:47:24,224 --> 00:47:25,639
Speaker 0: I had draws like that every game.

741
00:47:27,462 --> 00:47:31,400
Speaker 1: The other thing is that when you get to the end of the round, you don't play your final card.

742
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,800
Speaker 1: So really you can save two cards.

743
00:47:33,980 --> 00:47:44,004
Speaker 1: So if I had three ones and three fours, I would throw away a one at the start, or maybe throw away a four at the start, and then one of the ones, I would just sort of say, "This is the card.

744
00:47:44,025 --> 00:47:45,636
Speaker 1: I'm not going to play this round no matter

745
00:47:45,677 --> 00:47:45,858
Speaker 1: what.".

746
00:47:46,281 --> 00:47:56,060
Speaker 1: And now I know that the ones and the fours are all safe to play, and I would put those also, deprioritize playing those, and try to get all the other cards played first.

747
00:47:56,424 --> 00:47:57,118
Speaker 1: I went harder.

748
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,840
Speaker 1: Because I know that those are the dangerous and risky ones.

749
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:05,225
Speaker 0: Because the fact that if someone paradoxes the hand ends immediately, I won the second game.

750
00:48:05,526 --> 00:48:14,940
Speaker 0: because every time someone paradoxed, almost every time I would have been forced to paradox if it got around to me, but someone paradoxed before, I aggressively tried to make someone paradox.

751
00:48:15,562 --> 00:48:15,871
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

752
00:48:16,420 --> 00:48:17,878
Speaker 0: And the way I would do that is...

753
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,340
Speaker 1: Especially, the turn order matters a lot too, especially on the final round.

754
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:24,559
Speaker 1: Like if you can see, because everyone's going to deal one hand, right?

755
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:34,580
Speaker 1: So if you say, "Okay, I'm the first dealer in the first round, and then that means on the last round, I will be going second.

756
00:48:35,061 --> 00:48:37,858
Speaker 1: And so I'm probably relatively

757
00:48:37,939 --> 00:48:38,120
Speaker 1: safe."

758
00:48:38,140 --> 00:48:41,040
Speaker 1: Because you're not going to paradox before the last round unless you're really bad, right?

759
00:48:41,202 --> 00:48:42,400
Speaker 0: It happened a couple times though.

760
00:48:43,022 --> 00:48:46,740
Speaker 0: You can just get screwed by the colors or like being forced to desuit or something.

761
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,800
Speaker 1: It's possible, but it's like on that final round, it's like, "Okay, I'm going to be going second.

762
00:48:50,920 --> 00:49:00,379
Speaker 1: I'm kind of safe, but I can obviously be in a position of power to really hurt the third or fourth

763
00:49:00,419 --> 00:49:00,760
Speaker 1: players.".

764
00:49:01,081 --> 00:49:10,055
Speaker 1: If I look at that board on that final turn, and I see that three threes have been used, and I've got the fourth three, it's like, "I'll play

765
00:49:10,076 --> 00:49:10,297
Speaker 1: that.".

766
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,316
Speaker 1: And it's like, "All right, it can't be a three.

767
00:49:13,457 --> 00:49:13,759
Speaker 1: What do you

768
00:49:13,779 --> 00:49:13,900
Speaker 1: got?".

769
00:49:14,502 --> 00:49:21,160
Speaker 0: So what I did, and this was super effective just saying in these early games, I don't think it'll last because obviously this is easily defeated.

770
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:26,316
Speaker 0: Whoever in the first hand, whatever number, I look at all the numbers.

771
00:49:26,356 --> 00:49:27,560
Speaker 0: everyone who did not lead played.

772
00:49:28,381 --> 00:49:35,800
Speaker 0: I pick one of those players, especially if I have one or two of that number, and I do the same thing like pushing spades and hearts.

773
00:49:36,301 --> 00:49:45,520
Speaker 0: I play that number at my next opportunity to try to force them into a corner by getting to the point where I hope they had two threes, let's say, they got rid of one.

774
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:50,040
Speaker 0: I force other threes out to try to get to the point to where all four threes are taken up.

775
00:49:50,322 --> 00:49:51,879
Speaker 0: So now they've got a liability in their hand.

776
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:59,960
Speaker 1: I mean, filling up a number in general is going to create the most dangerous situation for someone.

777
00:50:02,202 --> 00:50:06,240
Speaker 0: So I would try to keep two of a number, which is highly risky, like two fives.

778
00:50:06,722 --> 00:50:10,760
Speaker 0: Someone plays a five, I play a five, my next two cards are fives, just trying to fuck them over.

779
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:14,520
Speaker 1: Well, if you have two fives and you haven't shoved one under at the start, right?

780
00:50:14,561 --> 00:50:15,460
Speaker 0: I would keep one sometimes.

781
00:50:15,560 --> 00:50:20,700
Speaker 1: It's like, right, well it's like, you know that if you keep one of them to the end, you're safe.

782
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:26,700
Speaker 1: But if you can play both, then you know you've definitely probably put the hurt on somebody.

783
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:31,280
Speaker 0: Exactly, and I played this game both times the same way I play hearts.

784
00:50:31,781 --> 00:50:39,120
Speaker 0: I don't try necessarily to minimize my score so much as I try to fuck over other players and force them into bad situations.

785
00:50:40,041 --> 00:50:42,240
Speaker 0: And that's just how I often play trick-taking games.

786
00:50:42,420 --> 00:50:45,580
Speaker 0: And it's highly effective in two plays of this game.

787
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:51,040
Speaker 1: I think the worst draw in this game would actually be like three pair, right?

788
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,019
Speaker 1: Because you, let's say, got two twos, two threes, two fours.

789
00:50:55,521 --> 00:50:59,920
Speaker 1: I can hide a two at the start, I can save a three at the end.

790
00:51:00,362 --> 00:51:04,120
Speaker 1: It's like, well I've got two fours and I have to play them both, right?

791
00:51:04,300 --> 00:51:08,220
Speaker 0: If I had that situation, I would aggressively desuit early on purpose.

792
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:11,376
Speaker 0: Which, you remember, I desuited way early and everyone was like,

793
00:51:11,436 --> 00:51:12,099
Speaker 0: "Whoa!"

794
00:51:12,241 --> 00:51:13,138
Speaker 0: And I won, so.

795
00:51:14,121 --> 00:51:17,160
Speaker 1: But it's like, I would try, I would play those fours, right?

796
00:51:17,240 --> 00:51:23,459
Speaker 1: I would try to play them quickly so that, you know, because there's a risk that there could be five of them out there.

797
00:51:23,861 --> 00:51:29,840
Speaker 0: In that situation, if I had like three pairs, I would aggressively desuit to try to get them all out on purpose.

798
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:39,620
Speaker 0: Because, early, quickly, because if you have those cards and you're playing with the skewed board, then that lines up into an extremely orthogonally adjacent pile of points.

799
00:51:39,904 --> 00:51:40,879
Speaker 0: That is worth the risk.

800
00:51:42,462 --> 00:51:46,580
Speaker 0: You can have like a seven, eight, nine point hand and that'll probably win you the whole thing.

801
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:47,458
Speaker 0: It's worth going for it.

802
00:51:48,087 --> 00:51:49,040
Speaker 0: Of course, if you paradox!

803
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:59,800
Speaker 1: The problem is desuiting too early, you might end up hurting yourself because it's like, okay, I know for sure that there are, I ditched a one at the start and I've got a second one.

804
00:52:00,161 --> 00:52:02,400
Speaker 1: And I know there's only four ones out there, right?

805
00:52:02,942 --> 00:52:05,320
Speaker 1: And I desuit, you know, in blue or something.

806
00:52:05,780 --> 00:52:08,479
Speaker 1: And then everyone gets played except the blue one.

807
00:52:09,321 --> 00:52:12,920
Speaker 1: And I'm the only, this is the only one that's left because I ditched one of them.

808
00:52:13,742 --> 00:52:16,340
Speaker 1: But I can't play it because I desuited blue too early.

809
00:52:17,086 --> 00:52:18,740
Speaker 1: And now I screwed myself.

810
00:52:19,480 --> 00:52:21,860
Speaker 1: That's the risk you take when you desuit too early.

811
00:52:22,642 --> 00:52:29,460
Speaker 0: I played a very aggressive, high risk strategy in a game where everyone else at the table was playing very safely and conservatively.

812
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:36,799
Speaker 0: So I want to see what happens if someone else goes as aggro as I go and I imagine we both get fucked over and someone else wins.

813
00:52:38,161 --> 00:52:45,899
Speaker 1: I think the thing is, in those early games, I was trying to play safe, but I wasn't playing safe because I didn't understand how to play safe.

814
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:46,703
Speaker 0: And

815
00:52:46,744 --> 00:53:09,140
Speaker 1: I just explained how to play safe is to just realize, there are five of each card, if you ditch one at the start or the end, then all other cards of that number are safe, as long as you don't hurt yourself by desuiting a color too early, then you know which, you can separate your hand into the numbers that could paradox and the numbers that can't paradox.

816
00:53:09,180 --> 00:53:17,010
Speaker 0: I just realized, you know why we were able to get such heuristics and figure stuff out so quickly with two plays in this game and other trick-taking games?

817
00:53:17,170 --> 00:53:19,510
Speaker 1: We played with a bunch of smart people several times in a row.

818
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,489
Speaker 0: Well, I only played twice, but not just that.

819
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:23,510
Speaker 1: I think we played three or four times.

820
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:27,190
Speaker 0: Without suits, counting cards is trivial.

821
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:30,130
Speaker 0: Everyone at the table can have a full count in their head.

822
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:31,490
Speaker 1: What do you mean counting cards?

823
00:53:31,570 --> 00:53:34,870
Speaker 1: There's a board that shows you which cards have been played with little gems.

824
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,370
Speaker 1: So playing this game... You don't have to count anything.

825
00:53:37,712 --> 00:53:38,174
Speaker 0: Exactly.

826
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:49,530
Speaker 0: So playing this game lets you, as a player, who may not necessarily count cards in Hearts or Wizard or something else, feel what it's like to play a trick-taking game if you were counting cards.

827
00:53:50,970 --> 00:53:52,644
Speaker 1: That is the magic of this game, and I just realized it.

828
00:53:53,370 --> 00:54:01,570
Speaker 1: Look at the board, and you can see, I got a yellow six, and you look at the board, and it shows you that the yellow seven and eight have already been played.

829
00:54:01,831 --> 00:54:03,260
Speaker 1: And you're like, "Yellow six?

830
00:54:03,321 --> 00:54:04,549
Speaker 1: Oh, you have a six, not a yellow

831
00:54:04,569 --> 00:54:04,650
Speaker 1: six.".

832
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:11,668
Speaker 1: But you make it a yellow six, because you've seen that the seven and the eight have already been played, and it's like, "Well, you know what could beat

833
00:54:11,688 --> 00:54:11,849
Speaker 1: that?".

834
00:54:12,090 --> 00:54:13,629
Speaker 1: Unless they break and play drums.

835
00:54:14,330 --> 00:54:19,130
Speaker 0: The only information you have to keep track of, really, is what card did you throw away?

836
00:54:19,290 --> 00:54:22,889
Speaker 0: Because that's the only information you have, other than your hand, that no one else has.

837
00:54:23,830 --> 00:54:23,892
Speaker 1: Yep.

838
00:54:24,303 --> 00:54:24,488
Speaker 1: Exactly.

839
00:54:25,730 --> 00:54:29,030
Speaker 1: And you would love to know what everyone else threw away.

840
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:31,030
Speaker 1: That would be super valuable information.

841
00:54:32,571 --> 00:54:43,670
Speaker 0: So yeah, you could probably take other trick-taking games as a teaching exercise to make the count on a board like this, so people could experience what hearts is like if everyone was counting cards.

842
00:54:44,330 --> 00:54:45,799
Speaker 1: I feel like you could just play one hand of Wizard, right?

843
00:54:47,510 --> 00:54:48,738
Speaker 1: Until everyone understands it.

844
00:54:48,819 --> 00:54:52,710
Speaker 1: Just play Wizard until everyone gets it, and then just immediately switch to this instead.

845
00:54:54,673 --> 00:54:58,108
Speaker 0: I think this game's gonna be a big hit with my family, too.

846
00:54:59,374 --> 00:55:03,390
Speaker 1: I think anyone who is a trick-taking game enjoyer should add this one.

847
00:55:04,090 --> 00:55:17,489
Speaker 1: If you're only gonna have five trick-taking games on your shelf, besides regular deck of cards, it's probably this one, a Wizard, maybe the Haifu one, the Yokozu dice.

848
00:55:18,131 --> 00:55:20,430
Speaker 1: Those are the top ones that I've done.

849
00:55:21,011 --> 00:55:22,729
Speaker 1: So, Fuji Flush, I guess if that counts, maybe.

850
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,110
Speaker 0: Moo is an elevated experience that is not for everyone.

851
00:55:27,353 --> 00:55:28,642
Speaker 0: I like Moo, but I can't.

852
00:55:28,662 --> 00:55:29,528
Speaker 0: I'm not good at it.

853
00:55:30,370 --> 00:55:31,869
Speaker 1: Maybe the stick-elm, maybe?

854
00:55:32,431 --> 00:55:36,149
Speaker 0: Ooh, I really like stick-elm, but I haven't played it in so long.

855
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this one is above--.

856
00:55:38,290 --> 00:55:43,309
Speaker 0: The last time we played stick-elm was at the PAX, where the seventh guest arrived.

857
00:55:44,510 --> 00:55:48,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the point is, the cat one is above the stick-elms of the world, right?

858
00:55:49,470 --> 00:55:55,110
Speaker 0: Well, stick-elm, I don't know if I like it because it's good, or I like it because it's almost an inversion.

859
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:58,989
Speaker 0: It's such the opposite of everything trick-taking games stand for.

860
00:56:00,152 --> 00:56:05,846
Speaker 0: It's like the deconstruction of a trick-taking game, so I don't know if it's good, or if it's just so novel that I'm obsessed with it.

861
00:56:05,866 --> 00:56:06,570
Speaker 0: It might not be good.

862
00:56:07,730 --> 00:56:17,510
Speaker 1: But anyway, also, coming up with this genius, and also the deluxe edition that we were playing has very nice pieces, all these cute little gems with cat-related and science-related items.

863
00:56:17,770 --> 00:56:19,370
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, the game, the style is just great.

864
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:22,750
Speaker 0: The cute little cat with a little chromatic aberration, this game's just a gem.

865
00:56:24,674 --> 00:56:24,975
Speaker 1: Yep.

866
00:56:24,995 --> 00:56:29,390
Speaker 1: So, excellent game, and it's not expensive, and it's not large, which is great.

867
00:56:30,610 --> 00:56:35,010
Speaker 1: Oh, and I guess we wanted to mention, the game was published by Hobby Japan.

868
00:56:35,210 --> 00:56:36,250
Speaker 1: It's a Japanese game.

869
00:56:36,392 --> 00:56:37,089
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, right.

870
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:39,070
Speaker 1: Who was the designer again?

871
00:56:39,110 --> 00:56:39,934
Speaker 0: Oh, the designer.

872
00:56:39,954 --> 00:56:40,598
Speaker 0: Oh, I gotta go back.

873
00:56:40,618 --> 00:56:44,630
Speaker 0: I was clicking around in photos of the game for the livestream while we were talking.

874
00:56:45,010 --> 00:56:48,230
Speaker 0: The designer of this game, Muneyuki Yokuchi.

875
00:56:49,034 --> 00:56:51,870
Speaker 1: Okay, well yeah, good job to that person.

876
00:56:52,630 --> 00:57:01,809
Speaker 1: But the thing I learned, thanks to this game, is I thought Hobby Japan was a magazine, which it is, I guess, about Gundam modeling and stuff like that.

877
00:57:02,270 --> 00:57:08,589
Speaker 1: But apparently, Hobby Japan is a publisher of many different nerdy things in Japan, not just a magazine.

878
00:57:09,291 --> 00:57:10,329
Speaker 0: Most euro games?

879
00:57:11,591 --> 00:57:18,190
Speaker 1: If you buy D&D in Japan, it's translated and locally published by Hobby Japan.

880
00:57:18,230 --> 00:57:21,590
Speaker 0: They've even got the distribution rights to Advanced Squad Leader.

881
00:57:22,871 --> 00:57:26,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, I didn't realize Hobby Japan was this whole publishing company.

882
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,530
Speaker 1: I thought it was just a magazine.

883
00:57:29,090 --> 00:57:35,390
Speaker 1: But nope, it's a whole publishing company, they publish lots of stuff over there, including board games, including this tabletop game.

884
00:57:35,630 --> 00:57:37,029
Speaker 1: So, that's pretty cool.

885
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:44,220
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

886
00:57:44,420 --> 00:57:49,339
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

892
00:58:10,520 --> 00:58:13,340
Speaker 1: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

893
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:18,311
Speaker 0: And the Patreon patrons for this episode of Geek Nights are Alan Drosling, Gigi Drel, Lieutenant Brett Case, K.R.

Speaker 0: Makes Music, Krista Dodd, Clinton Walton, Dex, Finn, Joel Hayes, Penny Rymer, Rebecca Dunn, Sam Erickson, Shervin Von Hurl, and many, many people who choose to give an amount that is smaller than $5.

895
00:58:30,060 --> 00:58:34,176
Speaker 0: Like a dollar or something, I assume, because you want that customized RSS feed.

896
00:58:34,196 --> 00:58:35,060
Speaker 0: that's actually pretty nice.

897
00:58:36,082 --> 00:58:38,333
Speaker 0: One person gives $4.99, which is extra funny, you were cool.

898
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:49,348
Speaker 0: But anyway, I'm actually distracted talking about people drinking inadvisable things in a Discord right now, so I'm just going to leave you with...

899
00:58:51,020 --> 00:58:55,800
Speaker 1: Your man might have the Star Wars Lego set Death Star, but can he chug his sparkling water and not burp?
