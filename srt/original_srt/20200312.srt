1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,183
Speaker 1: It's Thursday March 12th 2020.

2
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:11,645
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:11,846 --> 00:00:15,700
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight the Mandalorian.

4
00:00:16,801 --> 00:00:29,800
Speaker 0: Let's do this All right, so my work is awesome work at least on my team because we can just work from home Sort of whenever and actually I work from home probably less than almost everyone else.

5
00:00:30,844 --> 00:00:36,700
Speaker 1: Lot of my engineers work from home a lot But I rarely do since I'm a very visible position and I got to talk to my base.

6
00:00:37,181 --> 00:00:42,499
Speaker 0: It's funny that actually the people who are more visible are out of the office more, huh?

7
00:00:43,485 --> 00:00:48,816
Speaker 1: anyway But yeah, I'm also in a weird industry compared to like any other normal company.

8
00:00:49,218 --> 00:00:49,419
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

9
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:58,990
Speaker 0: But yeah, I tend to only work from home like, you know, and when I got a bunch of chores piled up You know something where it's like, okay I work from home get my shit back in order like

10
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,702
Speaker 1: the super is gonna come do something and I want to like be home To let them in.

11
00:01:01,783 --> 00:01:03,530
Speaker 0: but exactly right and it's like.

12
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:06,120
Speaker 0: that is you know, it's like, you know.

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,273
Speaker 0: Obviously you think I'll work from home every single day.

14
00:01:08,313 --> 00:01:09,480
Speaker 0: That would be the best thing ever.

15
00:01:09,621 --> 00:01:12,240
Speaker 1: But everyone I know who's done that has started to go crazy.

16
00:01:12,822 --> 00:01:17,637
Speaker 0: I'm actually perfectly content to just work from home occasionally enough to have my shit together and like that's.

17
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:18,721
Speaker 0: you know I don't.

18
00:01:18,801 --> 00:01:21,109
Speaker 0: actually I'm okay going to the office offices are.

19
00:01:21,350 --> 00:01:28,015
Speaker 1: I wanted to work from home a lot more when I had a commute But now it takes me like 12 minutes to get to my desk.

20
00:01:28,036 --> 00:01:29,040
Speaker 0: Yeah anyway from here.

21
00:01:29,562 --> 00:01:38,080
Speaker 0: So but now they're like, oh my god virus, right and some people they're panicking too much And some people not panicking enough and too much is obviously better than not enough.

22
00:01:38,722 --> 00:01:40,509
Speaker 0: But I don't see a lot of people getting it just right.

23
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:41,915
Speaker 1: too much is better than not enough.

24
00:01:42,035 --> 00:01:45,569
Speaker 1: up to the point of I am Going to Mad Max that is that is too much.

25
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:46,473
Speaker 0: Yes, that is too much.

26
00:01:46,513 --> 00:01:48,682
Speaker 0: You cannot personally Mad Max Maybe.

27
00:01:48,702 --> 00:01:53,056
Speaker 0: so my company decided to do was not let anyone travel on business trips.

28
00:01:53,117 --> 00:01:53,678
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

29
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,120
Speaker 0: I'm on that.

30
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,140
Speaker 1: I'm not allowed to go to conferences until not going any business trips anyway.

31
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:01,960
Speaker 0: And to they're like, okay, we made sure everyone's VPN works in their computer.

32
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,057
Speaker 0: Let's try to work from home for two days to see how it goes.

33
00:02:05,117 --> 00:02:11,320
Speaker 0: so Wednesday after I already left work, they sent an email saying hey work from home Thursday Friday.

34
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:19,207
Speaker 0: So this morning I got on the train and it went back because like if they didn't say don't come to work I would have I'd go in.

35
00:02:19,388 --> 00:02:20,814
Speaker 0: Yeah, they didn't cancel hockey.

36
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:22,220
Speaker 0: I would have gone to hockey, right?

37
00:02:23,522 --> 00:02:26,053
Speaker 0: But yeah, no, they're like, okay work from home Thursday Friday.

38
00:02:26,073 --> 00:02:31,014
Speaker 0: So Michael not gonna argue with you Right, I might be willing to go to work, but I'm not gonna go.

39
00:02:31,074 --> 00:02:32,200
Speaker 0: it's an empty office.

40
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:35,680
Speaker 0: But I had to go and get my work computer that I left at work.

41
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:39,040
Speaker 0: It's a lot of other people seem to carry their work laptops back and forth every day.

42
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:39,847
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

43
00:02:40,371 --> 00:02:41,359
Speaker 0: I only carry it home.

44
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:45,720
Speaker 0: Like if you see at the end of the day my laptops not on the desk, that means I work at home tomorrow.

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,242
Speaker 1: It's interesting.

46
00:02:46,282 --> 00:02:54,872
Speaker 1: a lot of people I know like not just my current job and in all the jobs I've ever had Don't have like good PCs or equipment at home.

47
00:02:54,892 --> 00:02:56,056
Speaker 0: Like they need I'm not using.

48
00:02:56,177 --> 00:02:57,542
Speaker 0: I'm not using my purse I had.

49
00:02:57,582 --> 00:02:57,763
Speaker 0: do.

50
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,453
Speaker 0: I'm not using my personal computer for work.

51
00:02:59,835 --> 00:03:03,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I'm working from home I do because I don't need remember the kind of job I do.

52
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:06,300
Speaker 1: I don't need like local files or anything.

53
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:07,327
Speaker 1: No, it's not about that.

54
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:09,200
Speaker 0: It's I'm not gonna use my hardware.

55
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:15,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't I don't care for my works if they want it if they want me to have a good You know a computer at home to work on.

56
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,497
Speaker 0: Well, they should have bought me one.

57
00:03:16,718 --> 00:03:18,510
Speaker 0: Yeah But I already bought me this one.

58
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,220
Speaker 0: So that's the one I'll use right?

59
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:24,540
Speaker 0: My computer would actually do the work a lot faster, but they didn't want to buy me a fancy work laptop.

60
00:03:24,862 --> 00:03:27,660
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna do the work at the speed of the laptop that they have provided.

61
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,750
Speaker 0: That's you know, anyway, that's a separate issue.

62
00:03:31,811 --> 00:03:36,606
Speaker 0: So this morning I went back to the work to get You know my laptop and bring it home.

63
00:03:36,726 --> 00:03:40,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, I tried to go to TJ's which is across the street from my work.

64
00:03:40,621 --> 00:03:41,885
Speaker 0: I'm there at like 9 a.m.

65
00:03:41,966 --> 00:03:55,400
Speaker 0: And I'm like, you know what I'm going this TJ, right and I'm gonna get me some snacks And maybe I'll get some English muffin because they sell if you don't know Thomas English muffins at the grocery store usually overpriced when they're on sale There may be like $2.

66
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:55,742
Speaker 0: TJ's.

67
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,975
Speaker 0: English muffins are better and only like a dollar fifty at all time.

68
00:03:59,015 --> 00:04:00,100
Speaker 0: Hell, yeah, that's right.

69
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:03,479
Speaker 0: So I was trying to get and then I wanted to maybe get some locks to put on there, right?

70
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:12,145
Speaker 0: They're sold out of locks Wow, and there was a usually that TJ, you know TJ's in Manhattan often have mega lines Right.

71
00:04:12,507 --> 00:04:14,580
Speaker 0: This one rarely has the mega line.

72
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,690
Speaker 0: The line was wrapped like around the whole store.

73
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:24,937
Speaker 1: I find the most fascinating about this is like in Midtown Like I went to a random CVS just like to get a Red Bull they got everything like.

74
00:04:24,957 --> 00:04:25,900
Speaker 1: it is no crowd there.

75
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,265
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there's a CVS right next door.

76
00:04:27,285 --> 00:04:27,827
Speaker 0: They had everything.

77
00:04:27,927 --> 00:04:31,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like the people who are like panic buying thousands of rolls.

78
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:37,271
Speaker 0: I don't think people are Panic, some people are but I don't think most people are.

79
00:04:37,371 --> 00:04:40,970
Speaker 0: I someone showed a photo of Astoria grocery store That was really crowded.

80
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:44,595
Speaker 0: Yeah, and You know the the idea that they were trying to get across.

81
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:47,571
Speaker 1: like I saw that photo It didn't look that much more crowded than normal.

82
00:04:47,612 --> 00:04:48,336
Speaker 0: It was pretty crowded.

83
00:04:48,376 --> 00:04:56,383
Speaker 0: But the point is People the idea they're trying to get across is like all people are panicking but I looked at people's carts and it was just like Cereal.

84
00:04:56,443 --> 00:05:03,080
Speaker 0: Well, it's like normal shit and I'm like no no, no, no No, people are not going crazy cuz I'm virus and rushing and my you know, cleaning out the grocery store.

85
00:05:03,481 --> 00:05:07,477
Speaker 0: It's simply that when people don't have to commute and spend eight hours in office.

86
00:05:07,818 --> 00:05:09,588
Speaker 0: Oh my god They finally got time to take care of.

87
00:05:09,608 --> 00:05:11,600
Speaker 0: their finally got time to cook.

88
00:05:11,921 --> 00:05:16,000
Speaker 0: Maybe they could actually go to the grocery and buy ingredients to cook and not have to get delivery.

89
00:05:16,484 --> 00:05:18,360
Speaker 0: That's why there's a crowd at the grocery store.

90
00:05:18,742 --> 00:05:27,079
Speaker 0: Right if people could work from if everyone could work from home as much as I do The grocery store would just always be slightly more crowded than it is.

91
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it wouldn't need to be as open it like 2 in the morning like the Wegmans right to go to anyway.

92
00:05:33,722 --> 00:05:43,636
Speaker 0: So on the way back on the train after I bailed from the TJ and had the laptop I'm on the train and the train stops at 34th Street and a smell funny smell.

93
00:05:44,078 --> 00:05:44,780
Speaker 0: Oh and everything's.

94
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:46,553
Speaker 0: I look around.

95
00:05:46,573 --> 00:05:49,646
Speaker 0: there's no stinky people It's not a crowded train.

96
00:05:49,686 --> 00:05:50,470
Speaker 1: Go is it that does go?

97
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:52,480
Speaker 1: is it that bromine like disinfectant smell?

98
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,509
Speaker 0: No, the train was going in the opposite direction of commuting.

99
00:05:55,549 --> 00:05:56,271
Speaker 0: So it wasn't crowded.

100
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,940
Speaker 0: No, um, and it's kind of hazy.

101
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:03,059
Speaker 0: And I look at oh and there's like a firefighter coming out of a haze.

102
00:06:04,562 --> 00:06:12,300
Speaker 1: And it was basically they always talk about like track fire, dude I do know I've seen like 10 or 15 track fires at Queensborough Plaza in the time.

103
00:06:12,762 --> 00:06:16,980
Speaker 0: Right, but this is an indoor underground track fire that filled that station with smoke.

104
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:18,943
Speaker 0: So I switched.

105
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:24,419
Speaker 0: another train comes in and that train this the the indicators aren't on telling me what letter it is.

106
00:06:25,003 --> 00:06:26,860
Speaker 1: But you're just like I want to get out of this station, right?

107
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:32,088
Speaker 0: The train at the W I was on wasn't moving and I'm like, well that has to be NRQ It can't possibly be anything else.

108
00:06:32,491 --> 00:06:33,074
Speaker 0: I get on it.

109
00:06:33,636 --> 00:06:34,340
Speaker 1: It's all right for Street.

110
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,405
Speaker 1: I guess an R could.

111
00:06:35,767 --> 00:06:37,014
Speaker 1: I think there's a way for an R to get.

112
00:06:37,054 --> 00:06:39,163
Speaker 0: it would be on the same as the W So it would be behind us.

113
00:06:39,303 --> 00:06:49,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I switch and then finally after I switch the W moves And you know how this smoke and there's like a firefighter walking around.

114
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:50,740
Speaker 0: it's all creepy the thing.

115
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:58,208
Speaker 1: But I the thing I love about New York is like that situation to a New Yorker is just slightly Notable and easily forgotten.

116
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:00,440
Speaker 0: right and then but they don't tell you about right now.

117
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:05,523
Speaker 0: They don't tell you which one is leaving next and then the queue moves that I'm on which I didn't realize there's a queue until It stopped.

118
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:09,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, you watch you now because now I don't want to be right I don't want to be on a queue.

119
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:15,118
Speaker 0: So luckily I was able to run across at 42nd Street to get back on the W because they stopped.

120
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:16,303
Speaker 0: they have big at the same Stops.

121
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:18,060
Speaker 0: Yep, and then I got home.

122
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:25,880
Speaker 0: But yeah, but there was a. it was a creepy scene at 34th Street because track fires real common But I don't encounter the track fire indoor.

123
00:07:25,961 --> 00:07:39,340
Speaker 0: I've encountered the outside track fires occasionally But the indoor ones that filled the station with smoke and made it smell bad and had firefighters there are less frequent and You know, we were stuck in that station with the fire for a little while.

124
00:07:39,425 --> 00:07:41,739
Speaker 0: Yeah So it was slightly more notable than you know.

125
00:07:42,121 --> 00:07:47,638
Speaker 1: Like I've said before the creepiest thing that's ever happened to me on the subway other than the first time I saw a garbage train Before I knew those were a thing.

126
00:07:48,101 --> 00:07:50,808
Speaker 0: Because it's why do you think garbage train?

127
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:52,072
Speaker 0: Where do you see track geometry?

128
00:07:52,393 --> 00:07:53,536
Speaker 1: Oh my god that thing.

129
00:07:53,556 --> 00:07:57,319
Speaker 1: because it's not like it's scary It's not like it's made out of a skeleton or blind you.

130
00:07:57,702 --> 00:08:07,768
Speaker 1: It's more that if you've been in the city enough Like you just have this sense of you hear subway noise and you look to your right and a subway train comes in and then One time you hear the subway noise.

131
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,680
Speaker 1: They look to your right and something fucking else is there.

132
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:15,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, doesn't matter if it's scary It's just your brain like almost already shows you a subway.

133
00:08:16,095 --> 00:08:19,168
Speaker 1: and then you get there and the brains like wait This doesn't map the fuck is that?

134
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,997
Speaker 1: and it takes your brain a while to figure it out.

135
00:08:21,077 --> 00:08:21,640
Speaker 0: It's the x-ray.

136
00:08:24,843 --> 00:08:31,300
Speaker 1: But the creepiest thing I ever encountered on the subway was still Hurricane Sandy when they just turned off the lights at every station On the way it was.

137
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,308
Speaker 1: so it was just silent.

138
00:08:32,731 --> 00:08:38,750
Speaker 1: The train would stop the conductor would just walk out like lock a bunch of stuff Close a bunch of gates go into that little booth.

139
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:43,389
Speaker 1: If it was there all the lights would turn off one by one and then they'd get back on the train.

140
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:49,875
Speaker 1: They'd yell last call doors would close and then it was just pitch black outside of that train And we moved on to the next station.

141
00:08:49,895 --> 00:08:50,156
Speaker 1: Mmm.

142
00:08:50,757 --> 00:08:53,285
Speaker 1: It was a weirdly fun night that night.

143
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:56,197
Speaker 1: just because of that whole situation They're burning.

144
00:08:56,217 --> 00:08:56,479
Speaker 1: Yeah.

145
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,063
Speaker 1: All right.

146
00:08:57,264 --> 00:08:57,949
Speaker 1: You got any news?

147
00:08:59,214 --> 00:09:00,044
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got some news.

148
00:09:00,104 --> 00:09:08,170
Speaker 0: so Recently, there was some teasing tweets about a Super Mario Lego combo and that's pretty sexy news.

149
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,379
Speaker 0: It's like you go to Toys R Us when I'm a kid.

150
00:09:10,419 --> 00:09:11,203
Speaker 0: And what did I buy?

151
00:09:11,243 --> 00:09:12,107
Speaker 0: Nintendo games?

152
00:09:12,307 --> 00:09:12,910
Speaker 0: Yeah Legos.

153
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:14,298
Speaker 0: Those are the two things that I bought.

154
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:14,701
Speaker 0: Yeah.

155
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:18,197
Speaker 1: So now finally after 20 magic cards, I buy magic cards.

156
00:09:18,217 --> 00:09:19,461
Speaker 0: Sometimes not a Toys R Us.

157
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:20,063
Speaker 0: Yeah.

158
00:09:20,686 --> 00:09:21,147
Speaker 0: I mean I didn't.

159
00:09:21,228 --> 00:09:24,738
Speaker 1: I didn't buy them there At Toys R Us and Meijer.

160
00:09:25,059 --> 00:09:30,924
Speaker 0: anyway after 20-plus something years Finally those things combining in an official capacity.

161
00:09:30,964 --> 00:09:38,299
Speaker 0: That's a big news for a nerd But then they revealed what it is and what it is is actually pretty cool But something I have no interest in owning personally.

162
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,640
Speaker 0: Yep.

163
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,470
Speaker 0: If you have a kid you are obligated to buy them this.

164
00:09:41,651 --> 00:09:47,770
Speaker 1: Oh my god, when I get of appropriate age when I was a kid This would have been like the best gift of that Christmas.

165
00:09:48,091 --> 00:09:50,919
Speaker 0: Basically what is is a Duplo level kind of Lego.

166
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:59,062
Speaker 1: actually it's sort of in between Lego and Duplo and it's the pieces are Lego Conforming but the Mario pieces have like big blocky pieces.

167
00:09:59,403 --> 00:10:01,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they interface with the regular Lego.

168
00:10:01,429 --> 00:10:02,710
Speaker 1: you look at it You see what I mean, right?

169
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:03,912
Speaker 0: but anyway what it is?

170
00:10:03,973 --> 00:10:14,750
Speaker 0: it's a Lego toy where Mario is electronic in some fashion and he any Interact a little screen on his chest and had a screen on his chest and he interacts with the other Lego pieces.

171
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:22,434
Speaker 0: So for example you put Mario on top of a goomba and he'll make a goomba stomping noise and like get some points Appearing on his chest.

172
00:10:22,595 --> 00:10:31,685
Speaker 0: or like you'll put him near like a fire and he'll make that like whoa Noise of it when he got his feet get burned and his chest will show fire on it.

173
00:10:31,786 --> 00:10:36,537
Speaker 0: or he'll put him near the flag Pole and it'll go And show the flag on his chest right.

174
00:10:36,577 --> 00:10:40,327
Speaker 0: and it's sort of like you can make your own little Mario thing.

175
00:10:40,368 --> 00:10:46,030
Speaker 0: That's interactive Between you know Mario and all the little little bits and that's a pretty great toy.

176
00:10:46,632 --> 00:10:52,650
Speaker 0: But if you're an adult hoping for like, you know a Nintendo, I want a four thousand piece Mario.

177
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,455
Speaker 1: That's the size of a Death Star.

178
00:10:54,576 --> 00:11:02,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that or like a Koopa castle, you know thing where you open it up And you can put all and there's all sorts of things going on in there.

179
00:11:02,706 --> 00:11:08,344
Speaker 1: That is not what they made Yep, but at the same time I'd like this is just such a phenomenal looking toy.

180
00:11:08,364 --> 00:11:10,169
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah over made this way.

181
00:11:10,209 --> 00:11:13,426
Speaker 0: good I think everyone in any elementary school anywhere wants this.

182
00:11:13,627 --> 00:11:18,550
Speaker 1: Oh my god This is I would put like if I ran like a doctor's office This would be one of the things that would just be in the waiting room.

183
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:22,445
Speaker 0: I think there's certain rules about what kind of toys are okay for like.

184
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:24,876
Speaker 0: the nut is a choking hazard So you can't put in doctors.

185
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,470
Speaker 1: Yeah, it depends on what level I guess and also sanitation.

186
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:34,210
Speaker 0: I mean There's a reason why every every every doctor and dentist has that toy where the the wires things across the wires of the wood.

187
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,655
Speaker 1: with The blocks you move along the wires.

188
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,019
Speaker 0: Yes now that toy.

189
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,884
Speaker 0: if you search for doctor's office toy on Google Images You will see the toy.

190
00:11:40,986 --> 00:11:44,079
Speaker 1: Yep The orange wire was the best wire.

191
00:11:44,341 --> 00:11:46,270
Speaker 1: Okay, that was a really long one.

192
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:49,179
Speaker 0: Okay, obviously the longest highest most complicated one was the best.

193
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:49,901
Speaker 1: I was the orange one.

194
00:11:49,921 --> 00:11:52,690
Speaker 0: IIRC obviously some some other news.

195
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:56,428
Speaker 1: Uh, I don't know how many of you care about this, but remember geek nights.

196
00:11:56,468 --> 00:11:59,301
Speaker 1: two nights ago I talked about the hero pools and overwatch.

197
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:01,230
Speaker 0: you're doing the same news twice in two geek night.

198
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,194
Speaker 1: All I'm gonna talk about.

199
00:12:02,354 --> 00:12:06,270
Speaker 1: well cuz I I feel like I don't need to tell you that stuff shutting down.

200
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:13,450
Speaker 1: You should socially distance and like if your convention is canceled because of coronavirus like there's a reason they canceled it.

201
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:14,975
Speaker 1: Like don't get mad at the organizers.

202
00:12:15,617 --> 00:12:20,056
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, I if they canceled hockey if they didn't cancel hockey I would have gone.

203
00:12:20,076 --> 00:12:21,689
Speaker 0: no, but they canceled it.

204
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:23,457
Speaker 1: So hockey is a hockey.

205
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:27,633
Speaker 1: audience is a much lower risk than a weekend-long convention for a lot of reasons I don't want to get into.

206
00:12:27,814 --> 00:12:34,275
Speaker 1: it's bigger though a shorter duration shorter duration less interaction Fewer hotel stays.

207
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,302
Speaker 0: I still one person caught it like the wave.

208
00:12:36,383 --> 00:12:39,035
Speaker 0: one person coughs in the prison to the left to coughs in the Person to the left.

209
00:12:39,055 --> 00:12:40,567
Speaker 0: he coughs in the person then it makes a circle.

210
00:12:42,031 --> 00:12:43,603
Speaker 0: that could happen in one period.

211
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:49,170
Speaker 1: but They just did the rotation and the next four heroes they pulled out.

212
00:12:49,451 --> 00:12:58,370
Speaker 1: This will mean nothing to Scott, but they they pulled out Basically, like the four most important heroes just to see what the fuck happens.

213
00:12:58,731 --> 00:13:06,726
Speaker 1: So the four most used one Reinhardt the big guy with the shield like the guy that like everyone uses to make a big Channing the four best people.

214
00:13:07,049 --> 00:13:10,101
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, not the four best people but like for the most used ones.

215
00:13:10,182 --> 00:13:12,350
Speaker 1: The other thing is that two of them are healers.

216
00:13:13,291 --> 00:13:18,630
Speaker 1: There's two healers that are like super a big part of the meta and like people really worry about which healers.

217
00:13:19,092 --> 00:13:23,310
Speaker 1: They basically remove the two best healers meaning you can use a shitty healer or no healer.

218
00:13:23,471 --> 00:13:25,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, meaning well, you have to have two healers.

219
00:13:25,298 --> 00:13:29,501
Speaker 1: You could have two shitty healers, but healers that are shitty Oh, right because they have the roll lock.

220
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but good at other things.

221
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:39,609
Speaker 1: This shows the power of this feature Like the fact that the meta is so radically different now and just by saying you can't use these two healers.

222
00:13:40,091 --> 00:13:43,670
Speaker 1: Now like which damaged guy do you play is way different.

223
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:49,090
Speaker 0: This gave me an idea right of a way to possibly evolve this idea to make it even better.

224
00:13:49,194 --> 00:14:02,410
Speaker 0: Yeah Obviously if you have a bunch of choices in any game an asymmetric game and those choices are not all on the parade or frontier Right, if you there's no reason to ever use something in outside the parade or frontier unless you're dunking on someone who's worse.

225
00:14:02,532 --> 00:14:06,540
Speaker 0: But I'm saying if you ban Options that are not on the frontier.

226
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,910
Speaker 0: You're changing nothing basically, right?

227
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:11,790
Speaker 0: It's only interesting to ban options on the frontier.

228
00:14:11,810 --> 00:14:16,210
Speaker 0: Yep, because it's the only thing that will change what people play with them for moving the frontier, right?

229
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:17,776
Speaker 1: Instead of picking who to ban.

230
00:14:18,017 --> 00:14:21,070
Speaker 1: It'll just ban whatever heroes are used the most or the most effective.

231
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,720
Speaker 0: I'm saying go even further than that.

232
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:31,445
Speaker 0: Yeah every hour Right figure out which hero of each category was most used.

233
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:34,955
Speaker 0: no, right and Ban that one.

234
00:14:35,055 --> 00:14:39,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and that way it's obviously every single hero will be unbanned the next hour.

235
00:14:40,071 --> 00:14:40,793
Speaker 0: So it's like okay.

236
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:41,715
Speaker 0: This guy's opie.

237
00:14:42,156 --> 00:14:43,840
Speaker 0: He'll be available every other hour.

238
00:14:44,021 --> 00:14:47,249
Speaker 1: Oh, this gives me an even better idea based on your better idea.

239
00:14:48,273 --> 00:14:52,290
Speaker 1: Smash tournament right big weekend long full format smash tournament.

240
00:14:52,571 --> 00:14:58,250
Speaker 1: But the way it works is if you win around with a hero with a player character, that's what Hearthstone did.

241
00:14:58,314 --> 00:15:01,170
Speaker 1: Yeah You can never use that character again for the rest of the tournament.

242
00:15:01,511 --> 00:15:02,234
Speaker 0: Hearthstone did that?

243
00:15:02,254 --> 00:15:05,950
Speaker 0: Hearthstone did you had you bring X decks and you have to get a win with each one.

244
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,057
Speaker 0: I also did.

245
00:15:07,077 --> 00:15:12,450
Speaker 0: you can play your decks as much as you want But as soon as one of your decks loses that one is dead and you have to play the remaining.

246
00:15:12,510 --> 00:15:17,145
Speaker 1: But I want to see you like I win round one with Bowser I cannot pick Bowser again for the rest of the tournament.

247
00:15:17,407 --> 00:15:22,818
Speaker 0: Fuck you What if during it This how about this?

248
00:15:22,918 --> 00:15:25,050
Speaker 0: ready in a single match of overwatch?

249
00:15:25,693 --> 00:15:27,502
Speaker 0: Oh, you join a match of overwatch.

250
00:15:27,723 --> 00:15:29,170
Speaker 0: pick whoever the fuck you want, right?

251
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,999
Speaker 0: So who'd you say was this that's really strong?

252
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,707
Speaker 1: He'll don't say we're doing talent healers more.

253
00:15:32,808 --> 00:15:33,210
Speaker 1: I'd be more.

254
00:15:33,411 --> 00:15:34,879
Speaker 0: So you're more of the best healer, right?

255
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:36,005
Speaker 0: Yeah, you start playing.

256
00:15:36,327 --> 00:15:36,810
Speaker 0: you're dead.

257
00:15:37,212 --> 00:15:39,284
Speaker 0: You're still stuck in the healer role, but I can't be more.

258
00:15:39,324 --> 00:15:40,310
Speaker 0: ever is dead.

259
00:15:40,391 --> 00:15:42,170
Speaker 0: You cannot pick more again this match.

260
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,335
Speaker 0: You have to pick a different healer.

261
00:15:43,797 --> 00:15:46,408
Speaker 1: even better if you die and now you can't be any healer.

262
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:46,789
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

263
00:15:47,413 --> 00:15:49,990
Speaker 0: Well, I think if you die, I think I think it would reset.

264
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:52,758
Speaker 1: yeah, well that's because that's what root does with the birds.

265
00:15:52,818 --> 00:15:57,592
Speaker 1: if you decline like you go into turmoil four times and all your Leaders are dead.

266
00:15:57,612 --> 00:16:00,302
Speaker 0: They all respond or you could have.

267
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:13,610
Speaker 0: you could either reset you could just be like you're fucked or you could be like Here, there's some base healer who's like just this like replacement player and like if you looks like Barney from half-life.

268
00:16:14,170 --> 00:16:16,039
Speaker 0: Exactly you've lost you've lost.

269
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:18,270
Speaker 0: you've died with all of the real characters.

270
00:16:18,491 --> 00:16:22,282
Speaker 0: You're now stuck on the generic healer guy no matter what role you're in.

271
00:16:22,342 --> 00:16:23,847
Speaker 1: You just turn into Dan Hibiki.

272
00:16:24,148 --> 00:16:28,322
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly Right, so they the only problem with this.

273
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:30,550
Speaker 0: I think it has a little bit of snowball enos.

274
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:38,518
Speaker 0: Oh, it definitely does but if you sort of mix it up, right so you kill the other team's healer But they kill your tank and it's you can sort of.

275
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,950
Speaker 0: it might not be a complete snowball for one side because you have teams.

276
00:16:42,171 --> 00:16:45,693
Speaker 0: Yes, might be snowball per player if it's Depending.

277
00:16:45,713 --> 00:16:49,110
Speaker 1: Well, you know what that's like in counter-strike good old gun game, you know.

278
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:55,370
Speaker 0: But the point is with that mode right you could then combine it with that sort of ban, right?

279
00:16:55,510 --> 00:17:05,248
Speaker 0: So you could be like, okay, which heat healer was chosen in first Right in all these games and then you ban that one and then you have the reset.

280
00:17:05,288 --> 00:17:05,810
Speaker 0: so it's okay.

281
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:09,964
Speaker 0: We banned the healer that keeps getting chosen first and will reset you.

282
00:17:09,984 --> 00:17:11,410
Speaker 0: so you have to cycle through all of them.

283
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:14,061
Speaker 0: So you can't be good at a character.

284
00:17:14,102 --> 00:17:15,770
Speaker 0: You have to be good at a whole class.

285
00:17:16,132 --> 00:17:21,943
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to play over which is actually Bob That's kind of the direction overwatch is pushing in terms of.

286
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:23,490
Speaker 1: you can be you can play whatever you want.

287
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:23,953
Speaker 0: It's like.

288
00:17:23,973 --> 00:17:29,110
Speaker 0: you don't have to be good at tank and healing and sniping Yep, but you have to pick one and be able to play any character.

289
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,463
Speaker 1: Yeah of that role and remember way back the other change they made.

290
00:17:32,503 --> 00:17:34,050
Speaker 1: that was brilliant that I talked about a while ago.

291
00:17:34,812 --> 00:17:36,567
Speaker 1: They rank you separately for each type.

292
00:17:36,627 --> 00:17:41,002
Speaker 1: now So I have a rank in tank that's way higher than my rank in DPS.

293
00:17:41,022 --> 00:17:42,727
Speaker 1: for obvious reasons I'm 38, right.

294
00:17:43,911 --> 00:17:50,310
Speaker 0: Here's another thing you could do right which might not make players want to play is the problem.

295
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:57,250
Speaker 0: But instead of banning the one that's chosen the most we ban you from choosing the one you choose the most.

296
00:17:57,731 --> 00:18:01,783
Speaker 0: So so you are a. you know, even let's say you are a big Danny Vicky guy.

297
00:18:01,923 --> 00:18:04,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you can't play Dan.

298
00:18:04,712 --> 00:18:06,179
Speaker 0: Too bad, you're too good with Dan.

299
00:18:06,199 --> 00:18:08,429
Speaker 0: Yep, you can play the top meta guy.

300
00:18:08,489 --> 00:18:10,677
Speaker 0: sure You think you have no practice with.

301
00:18:11,038 --> 00:18:13,530
Speaker 0: basically is you get too good with the character?

302
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,969
Speaker 0: We force you off that character and onto another one.

303
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:28,227
Speaker 1: But what I like to is this all these types of things like what overwatch is doing and even the crazy stuff we suggested now They do a game design thing that I kind of like where instead of trying to balance your entire game forever.

304
00:18:28,247 --> 00:18:32,483
Speaker 1: Just Mix up a bunch of stuff and then the game becomes.

305
00:18:32,543 --> 00:18:34,250
Speaker 1: who figures out the new meta first?

306
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:34,954
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing.

307
00:18:34,994 --> 00:18:35,658
Speaker 0: is a meta?

308
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:41,463
Speaker 0: can a meta, you know matter how much you know It always takes time to form but it will change the game frequently enough.

309
00:18:41,904 --> 00:18:42,245
Speaker 0: It cannot.

310
00:18:42,265 --> 00:18:43,730
Speaker 0: you can prevent it from forming.

311
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:44,061
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

312
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:50,928
Speaker 0: No, no one can evolve to adapt to an environment if the environment changes more faster than the rate of evolution.

313
00:18:50,968 --> 00:18:51,169
Speaker 0: Yep,

314
00:18:51,189 --> 00:19:09,810
Speaker 1: and If a degenerate strategy appears like think back to sports fucking awesome I want to watch the overwatch league match where the the disaster meta that appears from the hero bands ends up making a weird degenerate Nonsense situation because that is the anomalous thing that I love to see in a sports match like crazy shit happening.

315
00:19:15,447 --> 00:19:18,525
Speaker 1: but anyway Things of the day what he got.

316
00:19:19,388 --> 00:19:25,211
Speaker 0: Oh, so I discovered this very short animated film recently Thanks to reading a lot of internet.

317
00:19:25,855 --> 00:19:26,540
Speaker 0: This is from.

318
00:19:30,044 --> 00:19:33,480
Speaker 0: I get the feeling this is one of those short animations that would play before a movie.

319
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:42,593
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not sure when it was exactly shown but it was Written directed and voiced by Mel Brooks, but there's other people involved.

320
00:19:42,613 --> 00:19:45,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can check the credits, but it's mostly a Mel Brooks joint.

321
00:19:46,881 --> 00:19:49,850
Speaker 0: It's called the critic has nothing to do with the other animated critic.

322
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:52,619
Speaker 1: I almost want to read out loud this description of it from the.

323
00:19:53,803 --> 00:19:55,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can read it yourself, but it's only what.

324
00:19:55,670 --> 00:19:56,733
Speaker 0: it's less than 10 minutes long.

325
00:19:56,794 --> 00:19:57,677
Speaker 0: It's super short, right.

326
00:19:57,797 --> 00:19:59,585
Speaker 0: three minutes long It's long.

327
00:19:59,886 --> 00:20:11,240
Speaker 0: So this will be a very entertaining three minutes for anyone who has never heard of This or seen it before like me where I've seen pretty much everything Mel Brooks has ever created.

328
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:13,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, several times over yet.

329
00:20:13,206 --> 00:20:16,397
Speaker 0: I hadn't seen this so that's got to be thing of the day worthy.

330
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:16,938
Speaker 1: Yep.

331
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:20,414
Speaker 1: I I'm not gonna say anything about it.

332
00:20:20,454 --> 00:20:21,020
Speaker 1: Just watch it.

333
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:23,933
Speaker 1: In fact, I would say watch it before you even read the YouTube description.

334
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,319
Speaker 0: got three minutes, right?

335
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:26,505
Speaker 0: You're wasting your time.

336
00:20:26,545 --> 00:20:27,309
Speaker 1: What are you doing?

337
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,214
Speaker 1: 24 seconds saying.

338
00:20:28,234 --> 00:20:29,220
Speaker 0: what are you doing with your time?

339
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,126
Speaker 0: Listen to geek nights.

340
00:20:30,206 --> 00:20:31,515
Speaker 0: No, you can.

341
00:20:31,595 --> 00:20:32,260
Speaker 0: you can change that.

342
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:36,939
Speaker 1: So We've never made this a thing of the day.

343
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:41,040
Speaker 1: It's been around for a while like in various forms, but it's irrelevant to our main bit.

344
00:20:41,201 --> 00:20:51,830
Speaker 1: this is just a YouTube video that is like 16 17 minutes long and is a collection of bloopers Failures and I feel like I've seen this before.

345
00:20:51,870 --> 00:20:54,101
Speaker 1: I think I've seen parts of this before from like specials Like.

346
00:20:54,161 --> 00:20:58,900
Speaker 1: I think I saw this in a documentary or parts of it, but it's from Star Wars a new hope.

347
00:20:59,522 --> 00:21:17,779
Speaker 1: But some of it isn't even mistakes so much as it's the video that they were filming but with the audio from the soundstage or the set that includes like Some production assistant or even in some cases the director or an assistant director yelling at stormtroopers like walk faster faster faster

348
00:21:18,721 --> 00:21:19,603
Speaker 0: I mean the all.

349
00:21:19,623 --> 00:21:21,128
Speaker 0: the entire movie was dubbed over.

350
00:21:21,228 --> 00:21:31,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much almost every scene in Star Wars the new hope as a DIs There's Almost everything in the entire original trilogy is dubbed over in post.

351
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:37,720
Speaker 1: In fact most action movies until like relatively recent times had a lot of ADR because good camera.

352
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:40,071
Speaker 0: But there was still audio recorded on set.

353
00:21:40,131 --> 00:21:42,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, it just was when they went to post.

354
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:44,295
Speaker 0: They just got rid of that like some old movies.

355
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:45,542
Speaker 1: if you see these things It's great.

356
00:21:45,582 --> 00:21:57,600
Speaker 1: Like you'll literally hear someone saying like pew pew pew and they shoot a gun sometimes Like you'll hear someone off-screen just yelling bang bang bang or especially like stunt actors need to communicate with each other.

357
00:21:57,781 --> 00:22:00,155
Speaker 0: There's like a fight scene or anything like that, right?

358
00:22:00,175 --> 00:22:01,020
Speaker 0: So they don't hurt each other.

359
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,573
Speaker 0: I was watching one from or they need to yell.

360
00:22:03,614 --> 00:22:06,989
Speaker 0: timings like okay Like let's say there's like a motorcycle jump over it.

361
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, that happens all the time and like James Bond movies, right?

362
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:10,844
Speaker 0: Then you know you hear people.

363
00:22:10,925 --> 00:22:13,054
Speaker 0: it's like okay one two three.

364
00:22:13,094 --> 00:22:16,406
Speaker 0: Okay go with the car and Now the motorcycle.

365
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:18,880
Speaker 0: timing, you know, you need instruction, right?

366
00:22:19,181 --> 00:22:26,780
Speaker 0: This was just like because they're all collected and then in post all you hear is Right, you know some special effects or some shit.

367
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:34,206
Speaker 1: But just the fact that this is a whole bunch of them and a variety of those situations just all strung together It's pretty entertaining to watch.

368
00:22:34,266 --> 00:22:36,193
Speaker 0: I mean Star Wars right a lightsaber fight.

369
00:22:36,253 --> 00:22:38,100
Speaker 0: It's two people smacking wooden sticks together.

370
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:40,307
Speaker 0: These clacking noises also, right?

371
00:22:40,327 --> 00:22:44,380
Speaker 0: They gotta replace those with the old, you know, electric razor and a metal bowl noise.

372
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:48,292
Speaker 1: You get Darth Vader's real voice, but like the actor thought he actually had to act.

373
00:22:48,512 --> 00:22:56,440
Speaker 0: Yep, and you get a lot of outtakes 100 everyone knows this but a hundred percent of Darth Vader is dubbed over by James Earl Jones.

374
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:04,762
Speaker 0: Yes, but the actor who actually played Darth Any might know but can now currently actually act bring to mind and I want to say it's a name I know.

375
00:23:05,003 --> 00:23:06,067
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know the name.

376
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:09,020
Speaker 0: I just can't say it right now, but there's a lot my brain is not good.

377
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,574
Speaker 1: there's that one scene where he chokes out a Rebellion.

378
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:15,150
Speaker 0: so giant dude, he died actually not too long.

379
00:23:15,170 --> 00:23:20,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, they keep having to do retakes of him choking out this dude, and it's actually really funny.

380
00:23:21,174 --> 00:23:23,666
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look it up cuz it's driving me nuts that I can't remember his name.

381
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:26,533
Speaker 0: Yep David Prowse.

382
00:23:26,673 --> 00:23:26,894
Speaker 0: Yep.

00:23:27,035 --> 00:23:27,737
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's a guy.

384
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:30,748
Speaker 0: He's a no if you ever seen him outside the Darth Vader costume.

385
00:23:30,768 --> 00:23:31,230
Speaker 0: He's enormous.

386
00:23:31,411 --> 00:23:34,844

Speaker 1: So I'm gonna as things in New York slowly shut down.

394
00:23:59,128 --> 00:24:07,768
Speaker 0: yeah I got nothing to do except make content and I guess Zelda randomizer has like gone up to the top of the list of things right now.

395
00:24:07,808 --> 00:24:12,407
Speaker 1: this weekend I'm gonna set up a Final Fantasy 4 free enterprise infrastructure, right?

396
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:13,110
Speaker 1: I'm gonna set it up.

397
00:24:13,130 --> 00:24:24,714
Speaker 1: So if anyone is interested in trying out the Final Fantasy 4 randomizer I will be very patient with you because I need some people to play it this way if you want to play Zelda 3 Randomized in some way.

Speaker 0: I am I will bike regardless of any virus.

431
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,136
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get a virus while biking.

432
00:25:28,256 --> 00:25:36,063
Speaker 1: in fact running is gonna be great because if if like all the places I run don't have People I don't have to deal with crowds of people blocking me and messing up my times.

433
00:25:36,183 --> 00:25:36,906
Speaker 0: less cars.

00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:47,010
Speaker 1: no that the next possible Convention for us at this point is probably gonna be Pax West and none of us have the virus yet.

437
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:48,478
Speaker 0: So we're can still podcasts.

438
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:51,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, and even if rims was something like oh, I got the virus Well, I probably got it too.

439
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:57,150
Speaker 0: Yeah And if somehow he does and I don't we can just podcast over the internet or whatever.

440
00:25:57,391 --> 00:25:57,512
Speaker 1: We.

441
00:25:57,532 --> 00:26:01,513
Speaker 1: the only reason we don't podcast over the internet because it's kind of a pain in the ass But we can.

442
00:26:01,533 --> 00:26:02,075
Speaker 0: we can.

443
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:02,979
Speaker 1: yeah, I'd have to.

444
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,670
Speaker 1: in fact, it's actually easier now that I got the new rig.

445
00:26:05,871 --> 00:26:08,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, we could go to that if we had to yep.

446
00:26:08,841 --> 00:26:10,707
Speaker 1: I don't think we'll have to for the foreseeable future.

447
00:26:10,727 --> 00:26:11,449
Speaker 0: I do not either.

448
00:26:12,253 --> 00:26:14,990
Speaker 1: Especially well anyway, so the Mandalorian.

449
00:26:16,211 --> 00:26:18,302
Speaker 0: So if you don't know what the deal is, right.

450
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:19,730
Speaker 0: so Disney bought the Star Wars.

451
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:28,339
Speaker 0: They made a bunch of movies They made TV show and they brought out their Disney Plus streaming network and they want to compete with the Netflix and you know Everyone else the hoot.

452
00:26:28,359 --> 00:26:29,629
Speaker 0: Well, I guess they own Hulu also.

453
00:26:29,710 --> 00:26:30,636
Speaker 0: I don't know why they just don't.

454
00:26:30,697 --> 00:26:37,510
Speaker 0: I thought they would just merge Hulu into Disney Plus But I guess they want to keep all the Disney branded content in the Disney Plus.

455
00:26:37,831 --> 00:26:44,750
Speaker 0: We want all the other things they technically own but aren't Disney branded on the Hulu side.

456
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:49,610
Speaker 1: Anyway, so last night we pulled up Disney Plus and I saw a movie that struck.

457
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:53,964
Speaker 1: You know Sometimes you see something and suddenly your brain remembers something from your childhood that you look.

458
00:26:54,004 --> 00:26:55,088
Speaker 0: poster looks familiar.

459
00:26:55,128 --> 00:27:00,315
Speaker 1: The name rings No bells, so there's this Disney Plus movie called Perry Uh-huh, and it's a lot.

460
00:27:00,355 --> 00:27:13,082
Speaker 1: It's basically a nature documentary with a narrative about this squirrel Mm-hmm, and I saw it when we were just scrolling through Disney Plus and I was like something that I've that some stern Powerful in my soul and we watched it.

461
00:27:13,102 --> 00:27:18,184
Speaker 1: I'm not only do I remember this I am like 90% sure we had it on a VHS tape.

462
00:27:18,324 --> 00:27:20,252
Speaker 0: I definitely didn't have it on VHS tape I'm not.

463
00:27:20,553 --> 00:27:25,712
Speaker 0: I can't tell you whether I remember it or not because the poster is like that's a movie poster I've seen.

464
00:27:25,773 --> 00:27:28,584
Speaker 0: yeah that name and that squirrel I do not remember.

465
00:27:28,604 --> 00:27:34,526
Speaker 0: if I think about I know The only thing that I can think of is like Ricky Dickey whatever heavy.

466
00:27:34,606 --> 00:27:35,670
Speaker 0: Was that a squirrel though?

467
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:38,101

Speaker 1: when I was a little kid I saw Ricky Dickey Tavi and then I didn't know what it was and it wasn't an internet to look it up and it took Me a long time to find out what like there was a book and all that.

479
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,534
Speaker 1: for some reason I kept asking adult.

480
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:11,224
Speaker 0: my memory knew my memory of Ricky Dickey there.

481
00:28:11,244 --> 00:28:11,947
Speaker 0: I think there was a book.

482
00:28:11,967 --> 00:28:13,629
Speaker 1: Yes There was a book.

483
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:20,950
Speaker 0: Yes I think my memory of it is seeing it in the public library in like the meeting room on a projector.

484
00:28:21,751 --> 00:28:34,167
Speaker 0: but my memory of seeing it there includes a memory of having seen it previously like I Remember seeing it in the library and I remember remembering having already seen it But I don't remember where I had already seen it.

485
00:28:34,852 --> 00:28:37,530
Speaker 0: I saw must have been from an even younger age when I had no memory.

486
00:28:37,591 --> 00:28:50,199
Speaker 1: I saw the Chuck Jones cartoon on TV and then I remember like I asked my parents like what it was and they didn't know and like my teacher didn't like no one knew what it was and TV guy didn't say anything other than Chuck Jones Ricky Dickey Tavi.

487
00:28:50,379 --> 00:28:51,622
Speaker 1: Okay, I didn't have anywhere to look it up.

488
00:28:51,923 --> 00:28:52,224
Speaker 1: Okay.

489
00:28:52,926 --> 00:28:55,193
Speaker 0: Anyway, uh That's it.

490
00:28:55,414 --> 00:28:56,800
Speaker 0: Anyway, don't Disney Plus right?

491
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,789
Speaker 0: So Disney Plus wants people to sign up.

492
00:28:59,151 --> 00:29:04,190
Speaker 0: So, of course they bring their best hottest property the Star War and they make a TV show.

493
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,082
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's eight episodes.

494
00:29:06,102 --> 00:29:06,827
Speaker 0: I thought it was more.

495
00:29:06,867 --> 00:29:07,270
Speaker 0: I was wrong.

496
00:29:07,431 --> 00:29:08,990
Speaker 0: Or today I found out it was eight.

497
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:09,793
Speaker 0: I thought I had watched.

498
00:29:09,854 --> 00:29:13,429
Speaker 0: I watched four episodes at the time when there were only four episodes out.

499
00:29:13,791 --> 00:29:15,341
Speaker 0: Didn't watch any more than that rim.

500
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:16,529
Speaker 0: watch the whole thing and I loved it.

501
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:19,982
Speaker 0: I really await the sequel and that was that wasn't.

502
00:29:20,022 --> 00:29:23,712
Speaker 0: and then they came out with more and I didn't watch him and That was that.

503
00:29:24,415 --> 00:29:25,820
Speaker 0: so I found out today.

504
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,844
Speaker 0: There were only eight episodes.

505
00:29:26,884 --> 00:29:27,406
Speaker 0: I thought there were more.

506
00:29:27,587 --> 00:29:29,899
Speaker 0: they're not long either So they're only like all.

507
00:29:29,919 --> 00:29:31,730
Speaker 0: the first one I think is longer longer.

508
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:37,710
Speaker 0: It's like a typical TV show where you got to start off with the long episodes to build your whole thing.

509
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:40,390
Speaker 1: Well, also kind of like a lot of shorter, you know.

510
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,370
Speaker 1: You know like some anime like the first episode was a little longer and didn't have the opener.

511
00:29:44,571 --> 00:29:48,230
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, they'll bleed in the first and last episode of a lot of anime.

512
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:56,617
Speaker 0: They'll bleed over into the credits and they won't have openers or closers or didn't show the closer over the anime to get those Extra seconds in there.

513
00:29:56,637 --> 00:29:58,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the side of the middle episodes.

514
00:29:58,850 --> 00:30:01,530
Speaker 0: We'll have full openers full closers and be really short and cheaper.

515
00:30:01,590 --> 00:30:08,409
Speaker 1: There were definitely some like late 90s anime where if you heard the closing music coming in too early Shit was about to go down.

516
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:14,710
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the ultimate anime for closing music is coming in while the show is still showing is Gundam seed.

517
00:30:14,931 --> 00:30:21,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, go well for she did it every episode but Gundam seed when it did it That was the episode where you'd be like what?

518
00:30:21,850 --> 00:30:25,230
Speaker 0: Because you'd because they would start playing it while characters is still talking.

519
00:30:25,310 --> 00:30:30,350
Speaker 0: So people are talking or fighting in robots and you hear the song and you're just like fuck you.

520
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:33,578
Speaker 0: So you didn't realize that was over.

521
00:30:33,598 --> 00:30:34,100
Speaker 0: it's like.

522
00:30:34,421 --> 00:30:35,304
Speaker 0: it's like guess.

523
00:30:35,866 --> 00:30:36,810
Speaker 0: it's like guess what?

524
00:30:38,450 --> 00:30:39,248
Speaker 1: five seconds.

525
00:30:41,751 --> 00:30:46,130
Speaker 1: So now let's back up a little bit - we were young and we saw Star Wars.

526
00:30:46,331 --> 00:30:51,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in the background of a bunch of scenes, there was this character that people would say.

527
00:30:51,107 --> 00:30:51,830
Speaker 1: Oh, that's Boba Fett.

528
00:30:52,031 --> 00:30:52,994
Speaker 0: Yep, didn't?

529
00:30:53,054 --> 00:30:54,158
Speaker 1: they didn't tell you shit about.

530
00:30:54,178 --> 00:30:56,285
Speaker 0: Boba Fett was a better toy than a character.

531
00:30:56,305 --> 00:30:57,730
Speaker 1: Here's what I here's what I knew about.

532
00:30:58,191 --> 00:30:59,636
Speaker 1: That's Boba Fett the Mandalorian.

533
00:30:59,676 --> 00:31:01,903
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, yeah, it's like that's Boba Fett.

534
00:31:02,285 --> 00:31:03,990
Speaker 0: It's a dude in armor with a jetpack.

535
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,916
Speaker 1: What's a Boba Fett?

536
00:31:04,956 --> 00:31:06,063
Speaker 1: Is that his name or his race?

537
00:31:06,224 --> 00:31:06,646
Speaker 1: I don't know.

538
00:31:06,807 --> 00:31:09,905
Speaker 1: I don't know What's a Mandalorian that is never explained.

539
00:31:09,945 --> 00:31:10,629
Speaker 0: bounty hunting?

540
00:31:11,330 --> 00:31:17,810
Speaker 0: Dude with guns and a jetpack and a grappling hook and he wants working with the Empire but not necessarily with the Empire.

541
00:31:17,850 --> 00:31:24,190
Speaker 0: He's obviously some mercenary and he wants to just make money dangerous enough to where even Darth Vader will not give this dude shit.

542
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:31,390
Speaker 0: But for some reason even after capturing Han and bringing Han to Jabba and getting paid hung out with Jabba.

543
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:33,321
Speaker 0: Anyway, instead of leaving to find new work.

544
00:31:33,643 --> 00:31:34,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I always thought that was strange.

545
00:31:35,011 --> 00:31:35,836
Speaker 1: Well, cuz we didn't.

546
00:31:35,857 --> 00:31:41,070
Speaker 0: but then it was died like a chump Yeah, and then it's like I actually didn't pay that much attention.

547
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:45,430
Speaker 0: I knew Boba Fett right, but I didn't pay that much attention to Boba Fett when I was a kid.

548
00:31:45,891 --> 00:31:50,870
Speaker 0: But later on like high school college Star Wars nerds were always like love it both of it.

549
00:31:51,873 --> 00:31:55,927
Speaker 1: And I'm like family guy would make jokes about this like I never bet the Fett right.

550
00:31:55,967 --> 00:31:59,510
Speaker 0: and it's like You mean that guy who was in the movie for two seconds?

551
00:31:59,670 --> 00:32:01,770
Speaker 0: I'm like people cared a lot about this character.

552
00:32:01,790 --> 00:32:02,693
Speaker 1: Which is the thing like that?

553
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:04,620
Speaker 0: what I did not care very much about?

554
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:09,758
Speaker 0: and usually I'm all about caring about the site the small Side character who doesn't get enough skill.

555
00:32:09,999 --> 00:32:13,270
Speaker 1: Well like in Gosaraki, I'm all about the president of the United States, right?

556
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,917
Speaker 0: And it's like I'm okay.

557
00:32:14,957 --> 00:32:15,620
Speaker 0: I'm Boba Fett both.

558
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:17,790
Speaker 0: That's cool, but I'm not a huge Boba Fett.

559
00:32:17,891 --> 00:32:22,962
Speaker 1: It was partly I think that when I looked at the costumes like Boba Fett really stood out and I really like that.

560
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:26,237
Speaker 0: if you want to talk about cool side character I'm a. I'm a vix wedge side.

561
00:32:26,438 --> 00:32:27,744
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah vixen wedge.

562
00:32:27,825 --> 00:32:28,829
Speaker 0: Give me those x-wings.

563
00:32:30,511 --> 00:32:38,821
Speaker 1: I'm also a very like early venture brothers like 21 and 24 like two henchmen But anyway, I like the Rosencrantz and Guildenstern side characters.

564
00:32:39,162 --> 00:32:41,250
Speaker 0: Obviously the fat man was mad popular though.

565
00:32:41,631 --> 00:32:54,330
Speaker 0: So making any sort of new thing for the mass audience based on Mandalorians bounty hunters Boba Fett's y'all cetera Is gonna be a good sell and is an easy thing to do as a side story?

566
00:32:55,672 --> 00:32:57,288
Speaker 1: And it's fertile ground doesn't?

567
00:32:57,349 --> 00:33:00,202
Speaker 0: yeah It doesn't conflict with anything in the main movies.

568
00:33:00,543 --> 00:33:06,367
Speaker 1: you have now and also you have not Established in the cinematic universe a significant cannon that you have to deal with.

569
00:33:06,528 --> 00:33:14,722
Speaker 0: Yep And you've got an overabundance of now Non-canon that was formerly cannon to completely poach from.

570
00:33:14,742 --> 00:33:17,410
Speaker 0: yeah, because mad nerds were all over that shit.

571
00:33:17,711 --> 00:33:19,497
Speaker 1: Yep, so take all that.

572
00:33:19,517 --> 00:33:23,590
Speaker 0: I don't even think that was the word Mandalorian even said in a Star Wars movie.

573
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:24,835
Speaker 1: I thought it's hard to see.

574
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:25,759
Speaker 1: this is the problem.

575
00:33:25,819 --> 00:33:28,570
Speaker 0: It might have been in the in the ridge in the prequel trilogy.

576
00:33:28,932 --> 00:33:34,296
Speaker 1: I feel like it was said because I knew the word But I don't know.

577
00:33:34,417 --> 00:33:36,204
Speaker 0: I knew the word from nerds on the internet.

578
00:33:36,245 --> 00:33:36,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't.

579
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:42,890
Speaker 0: I don't think I knew the Someone out there who's watched the prequel series because it definitely wasn't said in episodes 4 5 6.

580
00:33:42,890 --> 00:33:45,441
Speaker 0: Well, this is the thing said in episodes 1 2 or 3 nerds.

581
00:33:45,542 --> 00:33:46,446
Speaker 0: Let us know.

582
00:33:47,411 --> 00:33:47,749
Speaker 1: You know what?

583
00:33:47,830 --> 00:33:48,191
Speaker 1: It's like.

584
00:33:48,492 --> 00:33:58,090
Speaker 1: it's like when I first got into anime and I was in elementary school and like I couldn't find out about anime Like I'd see some anime but like there was no way to find out more about it.

585
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,442
Speaker 0: You googled that you wouldn't find too much.

586
00:33:59,462 --> 00:34:00,169
Speaker 0: there wasn't Google.

587
00:34:00,482 --> 00:34:01,032
Speaker 0: No There wasn't.

588
00:34:01,152 --> 00:34:02,457
Speaker 1: and then there'd be the.

589
00:34:02,517 --> 00:34:12,004
Speaker 1: it was the nerd in my middle school who knew a lot about anime Because he had lived in Japan for a long time and He would just like tell me things about anime that I like.

590
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:15,541
Speaker 1: like he told me shit about tenchi muyo And I was just like what the fuck always remember this.

591
00:34:15,581 --> 00:34:16,969
Speaker 0: I'll always remember fourth grade.

592
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:20,449
Speaker 0: It was a Japanese exchange student, right and we were doing something.

593
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:26,290
Speaker 0: We're like we drew pictures of what we wanted for holiday gifts or something of all and he drew a Super Nintendo.

594
00:34:27,291 --> 00:34:29,159
Speaker 0: Everyone else was like what the fuck?

595
00:34:29,179 --> 00:34:31,167
Speaker 0: there ain't no such thing as Super Nintendo.

596
00:34:31,286 --> 00:34:33,417
Speaker 0: Super Nintendo You're making shit up.

597
00:34:33,678 --> 00:34:39,438
Speaker 0: and then that Japanese kid was definitely not Right, they knew what he knew.

598
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,085
Speaker 0: what was up, right?

599
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:41,545
Speaker 0: Yep.

600
00:34:41,687 --> 00:34:49,130
Speaker 1: Anyway, so Boba Fett has this like cultural cachet, but also the new Star Wars movies.

601
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:52,483
Speaker 1: I'm not saying good or bad or anything, but some people really like them.

602
00:34:52,523 --> 00:34:53,386
Speaker 1: Some people really hate them.

603
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:54,290
Speaker 1: Some people don't care.

604
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:55,174
Speaker 0: I like them.

605
00:34:55,254 --> 00:34:57,103
Speaker 0: I just don't like them as much as the original.

606
00:34:57,364 --> 00:34:58,510
Speaker 1: I'm pretty much in that same boat.

607
00:34:58,570 --> 00:35:04,950
Speaker 1: I don't hate them as much as the prequel trilogy But they're set what like 20 30 years after the trilogy that everyone knows and loves.

608
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:09,732
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point is like I could watch original trilogy and I'll just be captured in it like a yep Oh my god.

609
00:35:09,993 --> 00:35:10,756
Speaker 0: prequel trilogy.

610
00:35:10,796 --> 00:35:11,720
Speaker 0: I'll try to turn it off.

611
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,687
Speaker 0: Yeah, right the new trilogy.

612
00:35:13,707 --> 00:35:14,349
Speaker 0: I'll watch it.

613
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:18,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would watch it again, but I could not be trapped by it.

614
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:25,778
Speaker 1: I could turn it off if I want but to this day like if you put up if if I see those twin suns rising Fuck I'm stuck here now until this movie ends.

615
00:35:25,819 --> 00:35:26,501
Speaker 1: There's no way out.

616
00:35:26,522 --> 00:35:26,943
Speaker 1: That's right.

617
00:35:27,506 --> 00:35:31,284
Speaker 0: So that's hopefully The end of the movie was the new beginning.

618
00:35:31,485 --> 00:35:42,273
Speaker 1: have a lot of stuff That's from a like a future of the Star Wars universe But the Mandalorian is basically set right like a couple years after Episode six.

619
00:35:42,534 --> 00:35:42,735
Speaker 0: Yep.

620
00:35:43,096 --> 00:35:53,990
Speaker 1: So like stormtrooper like instead of having like oh the stormtroopers It's like oh There's the general who's like leading a band of ex stormtroopers on this bullshit planet hiding from the New Republic.

621
00:35:54,831 --> 00:36:06,050
Speaker 1: It's set in the same universe that I have the maximum nostalgia for the accoutrements of Mm-hmm, and I think they realize there's a terrible power there coupled with it's not spoilers at this point.

622
00:36:06,311 --> 00:36:09,850
Speaker 1: The whole thing is he's protecting the child, which is basically a baby Yoda, right?

623
00:36:09,950 --> 00:36:10,736
Speaker 0: So that's the thing.

624
00:36:10,776 --> 00:36:11,541
Speaker 0: is they went in?

625
00:36:11,602 --> 00:36:12,730
Speaker 1: if you were surprised by that?

626
00:36:12,951 --> 00:36:15,306
Speaker 1: I really want to know how you avoided knowing that.

627
00:36:15,366 --> 00:36:18,075
Speaker 0: Yeah They go in already.

628
00:36:18,116 --> 00:36:21,970
Speaker 0: The show is like announcing that it's fanservice the show because it's Boba Fett the show.

629
00:36:22,537 --> 00:36:23,370
Speaker 0: No, it's not the Fett man.

630
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:33,890
Speaker 0: You know what for Star Wars if it's set in like the direct and then some genius is like what fanservice thing Could we come up with to make people who don't care about a Boba Fett man, right?

631
00:36:34,270 --> 00:36:35,133
Speaker 0: want to watch this show?

632
00:36:35,194 --> 00:36:37,442
Speaker 1: and the answer is turns into lone wolf in color, like.

633
00:36:37,482 --> 00:36:49,275
Speaker 0: I don't think they've told us exactly which Genius came up with a baby Yoda idea, but that's basically like whoever was like in a writers room and was like Baby Yoda.

634
00:36:49,435 --> 00:36:52,748
Speaker 0: and they're just like here's a here's this briefcase full of money.

635
00:36:52,789 --> 00:37:00,469
Speaker 0: you win Genius like the extent it's like, you know personally like it doesn't excite me personally that much like it's guy.

636
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:01,352
Speaker 1: It's cute I like it.

637
00:37:01,493 --> 00:37:02,176
Speaker 1: Well, I like.

638
00:37:02,276 --> 00:37:05,390
Speaker 1: I'm like the baby is a mural and dangerous, right?

639
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:07,740
Speaker 0: But the point is that I might not be a good guy.

640
00:37:07,841 --> 00:37:09,227
Speaker 0: that idea is obvious.

641
00:37:09,267 --> 00:37:09,810
Speaker 0: gold mine.

642
00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:14,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, right in terms of oh obviously that will be the greatest hit in the Boba Fett.

643
00:37:14,713 --> 00:37:20,109
Speaker 1: someone who never says a word and the entire universe just agrees as a badass despite not having any right.

644
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:20,954
Speaker 0: It's like.

645
00:37:20,994 --> 00:37:21,939
Speaker 0: it's like a music producer.

646
00:37:21,979 --> 00:37:22,623
Speaker 0: Here's a song.

647
00:37:22,784 --> 00:37:27,225
Speaker 0: They might not like that song They might not play that song in their car more than a few times, but it's like.

648
00:37:27,365 --> 00:37:28,470
Speaker 0: they know that's going platinum.

649
00:37:28,651 --> 00:37:29,617
Speaker 0: Yep, that right.

650
00:37:29,757 --> 00:37:30,683
Speaker 0: Here's a contract.

651
00:37:30,723 --> 00:37:31,025
Speaker 0: Mr.

652
00:37:31,407 --> 00:37:31,809
Speaker 0: Rock star.

653
00:37:32,151 --> 00:37:39,897
Speaker 1: So we were at PAX East a little while ago and at PAX East there's acquisitions incorporated where the penny arcade people play Dungeons & Dragons with celebrity guests and just fun.

654
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:42,930
Speaker 1: and I was there like helping but manage the audience.

655
00:37:44,051 --> 00:37:50,658
Speaker 1: They basically made the entire plot was basically the Mandalorian with a baby Something else baby Mike's character.

656
00:37:50,878 --> 00:37:55,116
Speaker 1: Okay, Mike's character turned into a baby and the rest of characters had to like Mandalorian.

657
00:37:55,136 --> 00:37:55,659
Speaker 1: that baby.

658
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:56,827
Speaker 0: so she's out.

659
00:37:57,873 --> 00:38:07,270
Speaker 1: So The Mandalorian if I actually had to describe it it did like on a high level before we get into like some details and review.

660
00:38:07,993 --> 00:38:15,279
Speaker 1: It gives me a lot of the feels that moments from the original Star Wars give me Sometimes and it gives me fan service and the fan.

661
00:38:15,319 --> 00:38:16,744
Speaker 1: but the fan service is not.

662
00:38:17,065 --> 00:38:19,153
Speaker 1: it doesn't cross that line where I cringe at It.

663
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:24,910
Speaker 1: like there's this one moment in a later episode Where it just does a venture brothers kind of thing or a vixen wedge kind of thing.

664
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:36,565
Speaker 1: It just costs to these two like dumbass Stormtroopers working for the bad guy and they're just sitting on speeder bikes outside of town and they they're just bored and they keep calling Back in like can we come back into town yet?

665
00:38:36,585 --> 00:38:39,776
Speaker 1: And they're like no Darth whatever just like murdered.

666
00:38:39,816 --> 00:38:43,910
Speaker 1: a bunch of people just hang tight and they're just like ends having this like mundane conversation.

667
00:38:44,332 --> 00:38:54,187
Speaker 1: and one of them just kind of is bored and he's kind of pulls out his blaster and starts fucking with it and there's like This garbage in the distance and he just starts taking potshots at the garbage Just can't fucking hit it.

668
00:38:54,811 --> 00:38:57,200
Speaker 1: And the other one starts kind of chuckling like that kind of stuff.

669
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,484
Speaker 1: like that's the line of.

670
00:38:58,805 --> 00:39:00,170
Speaker 1: I like that kind of fan service.

671
00:39:00,692 --> 00:39:10,272
Speaker 0: Anyway, so what the show is is it's actually just lone wolf and cub a serial Western Which is well just lone wolf income, but it's just So.

672
00:39:10,312 --> 00:39:12,342
Speaker 1: it's actually more than that because I've seen the whole thing.

673
00:39:12,985 --> 00:39:24,415
Speaker 1: every episode is Take the lone wolf and cub like basic like we have a lone wolf income situation and then make that episode an homage to a different Genre or milieu of cinema.

674
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:26,523
Speaker 1: like what episode is a full-on Western?

675
00:39:26,924 --> 00:39:28,570
Speaker 1: one of them is a full-on heist movie.

676
00:39:28,912 --> 00:39:34,750
Speaker 1: Like every one of them is a very different genre And the only thing that ties them together is the lone wolf and cub.

677
00:39:35,232 --> 00:39:39,328
Speaker 1: One of them is very Kurosawa as opposed to like traditional American Western.

678
00:39:39,689 --> 00:39:41,839
Speaker 1: Mmm I know you didn't like the Kurosawa one.

679
00:39:42,562 --> 00:39:44,270
Speaker 0: I mean, it's basically right.

680
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,998
Speaker 0: So, you know when you go see a Star Wars movie, right?

681
00:39:47,019 --> 00:39:47,941
Speaker 0: You're seeing right?

682
00:39:48,162 --> 00:39:53,799
Speaker 0: Everything is like very grandiose Right and large like you like on Endor.

683
00:39:53,919 --> 00:39:57,309
Speaker 1: There's like a thousand a TSTs like whatever there's everywhere, right?

684
00:39:57,850 --> 00:39:59,054
Speaker 0: But I'm just saying like now

685
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:00,037
Speaker 1: see with 80 not

686
00:40:00,117 --> 00:40:14,814
Speaker 0: just the content of what is happening story-wise being grand But the the production of it right the way it's shot, right the the kind of like wide You know terrain shots they have Right, you know even

687
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:18,685
Speaker 1: the stakes like we're waiting here to save an entire planet.

688
00:40:18,745 --> 00:40:20,149
Speaker 0: right the loud score, right?

689
00:40:20,630 --> 00:40:26,262
Speaker 0: It's like, you know trumpets like your door Star right, it's like they're there, you know, it's like ta-da.

690
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:27,205
Speaker 0: here comes the king.

691
00:40:27,285 --> 00:40:28,830
Speaker 0: Star Wars is walking through right?

692
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:31,711
Speaker 0: Whereas this is sort of like, you know It's like.

693
00:40:31,732 --> 00:40:40,824
Speaker 0: okay the actually the beginning couple episodes sort of have a lot of that going on Even though you're telling this smaller story about a few characters

694
00:40:40,864 --> 00:40:43,473
Speaker 1: because it's not environmental storytelling but it's more the same

695
00:40:43,514 --> 00:40:48,732
Speaker 0: way that cowboy bebop tells a story about just a few characters are in this bigger world where other stuff is Bigger than

696
00:40:48,772 --> 00:40:48,913
Speaker 1: that.

697
00:40:48,953 --> 00:40:56,040
Speaker 1: Well, like it doesn't tell you what the deal is with this like former Imperial guy No, but you can imply a lot about the universe.

698
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:59,390
Speaker 1: That's interesting without ruining it by being too specific, right?

699
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:08,245
Speaker 0: But the point is in those beginning episodes, even though you're still focusing on the small Set of characters in the smaller situation, right?

700
00:41:08,486 --> 00:41:09,792
Speaker 0: You're still setting It's.

701
00:41:09,912 --> 00:41:18,777
Speaker 0: it's those early episodes aren't doing the serial thing yet They're sort of the first two episodes are really sort of Setting up the.

702
00:41:19,098 --> 00:41:22,750
Speaker 0: you know that Mandalorian, you know, baby situation.

703
00:41:23,031 --> 00:41:25,961
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is gonna be carried through the other episodes.

704
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:28,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they do it pretty pretty well pretty succinct.

705
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:31,950
Speaker 0: So those early episodes I was actually kind of way into it, right?

706
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:37,932
Speaker 0: But then you know episode three a little bit and episode four completely Right.

707
00:41:38,132 --> 00:41:40,318
Speaker 0: What ends up happening is okay.

708
00:41:40,518 --> 00:41:48,401
Speaker 0: that big setup that we did right is now been reduced to this thread That is simply tying these independent episodes together.

709
00:41:48,963 --> 00:41:51,953
Speaker 0: as you see these characters travel from Story to.

710
00:41:52,013 --> 00:41:56,249
Speaker 1: so I would urge you because it's only eight episodes to watch the rest because I got stuff to do.

711
00:41:56,811 --> 00:41:58,237
Speaker 1: After that episode four.

712
00:41:59,000 --> 00:42:01,730
Speaker 1: it basically turns into resolve that plot and go deep.

713
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:06,230
Speaker 1: Oh, maybe it's not just fight an AT-AT in episode five.

714
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:16,218
Speaker 1: It actually is like like five is like a heist movie instead like totally different and that leads into like why the Mandalorians are Doing what they're doing and like it.

715
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:20,250
Speaker 1: it goes deep into the Imperial thing and answers a lot of questions.

716
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:25,988
Speaker 1: But like all the other someone way more important than Verna Herzog shows up with a lightsaber.

717
00:42:26,209 --> 00:42:37,662
Speaker 0: Okay The other thing is like I said, not just content wise but also, you know Filming wise score wise, you know all that right?

718
00:42:37,742 --> 00:42:40,470
Speaker 1: It's does it's not grand cuz I don't want it to be grand.

719
00:42:40,552 --> 00:42:41,090
Speaker 1: I like this release.

720
00:42:41,230 --> 00:42:57,197
Speaker 1: I love the idea of like like I like that AT-ST episode a lot because you zoom in and it's just here's some regular people and we're looking at an AT-ST like from the ground up in a zoomed in environment as opposed to here's the wide shot and there's A thousand AT-STs in a giant battle.

721
00:42:57,660 --> 00:43:02,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I just thought it was sort of cheesy like Oh, I love monster in the woods is an AT-ST Like.

722
00:43:02,495 --> 00:43:04,030
Speaker 0: I already saw that coming a mile away.

723
00:43:04,070 --> 00:43:08,970
Speaker 1: I saw it coming too because it was a formula and it's Kurosawa esque movie But it's boring and lame.

724
00:43:09,071 --> 00:43:15,322
Speaker 1: I wanted that because I really like watching like Good deep homages to other movies and the fact that

725
00:43:15,784 --> 00:43:22,799
Speaker 0: I don't mind that it's not the fact that there's no mod It's just that it was sort of like a oh my like, okay I see we're doing

726
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:23,643
Speaker 1: it but I will say it's got.

727
00:43:23,663 --> 00:43:24,849
Speaker 1: the other episodes are not like that.

728
00:43:24,970 --> 00:43:26,870
Speaker 1: All right, like it does not do but all you know.

729
00:43:26,870 --> 00:43:30,803
Speaker 0: But episode three like the second half was sort of you know winding down right and it's like.

730
00:43:31,244 --> 00:43:33,111
Speaker 0: I still can't find words to describe It.

731
00:43:33,131 --> 00:43:36,810
Speaker 0: that will let anyone accept my feelings but basically I don't accept your feelings.

732
00:43:36,890 --> 00:43:38,918
Speaker 0: I know you don't but I think I'm sorry.

733
00:43:38,938 --> 00:43:42,170
Speaker 1: episode six is the heist movie episode five is an American Western.

734
00:43:42,371 --> 00:43:48,928
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is every time I watch live-action American television of recent times and even actually older times too, right?

735
00:43:49,930 --> 00:43:55,394
Speaker 0: There's sort of this feeling of like cheapness to it And I can't describe.

736
00:43:55,414 --> 00:43:57,100
Speaker 0: that makes me not care.

737
00:43:57,120 --> 00:43:58,945
Speaker 1: that is never sufficiently explain this to me.

738
00:43:59,046 --> 00:44:00,370
Speaker 1: nor do I recognize this.

739
00:44:00,511 --> 00:44:05,154
Speaker 0: I lack the English language to describe What is going on?

740
00:44:05,194 --> 00:44:13,014
Speaker 0: But like, you know, if you watch a movie versus a TV show, there's like a clear difference in Something.

741
00:44:13,034 --> 00:44:17,530
Speaker 1: you just you're just like the people and more who like to miss because the graphics you just want.

742
00:44:19,652 --> 00:44:24,070
Speaker 0: Their movies old black and white movies that don't have this problem.

743
00:44:24,070 --> 00:44:25,756
Speaker 0: But you ever all the shitty resolution.

744
00:44:25,776 --> 00:44:29,270
Speaker 1: you have a problem with old black and white TV shows from that same era?

745
00:44:31,850 --> 00:44:32,591
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

746
00:44:32,671 --> 00:44:33,554
Speaker 0: I think you do.

747
00:44:33,574 --> 00:44:35,199
Speaker 1: I think you do.

748
00:44:35,219 --> 00:44:42,628
Speaker 0: it's just something about tell live-action television from the United States Especially recent of you United States television, right?

749
00:44:43,070 --> 00:44:44,033
Speaker 0: Which I thought I started.

750
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:49,510
Speaker 0: I started getting this feeling around the time when like those HBO serials became like a big deal.

751
00:44:49,590 --> 00:44:51,490
Speaker 0: I think you're just got like sopranos times.

752
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:52,695
Speaker 1: I think you're just old where it's like.

753
00:44:52,735 --> 00:44:55,788
Speaker 1: I started watching those shows and people are all hype over them didn't wash like Oz.

754
00:44:56,573 --> 00:45:01,015
Speaker 0: I did watched a few episodes and I was like I mean, you don't like Star Trek.

755
00:45:01,035 --> 00:45:02,620
Speaker 0: You don't like mostly I never like Star Trek.

756
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:02,880
Speaker 1: Yeah.

757
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:03,663
Speaker 1: I know that's terrible.

758
00:45:04,044 --> 00:45:05,889
Speaker 1: Yeah you not Star Trek.

759
00:45:07,814 --> 00:45:14,169
Speaker 0: There are terrible Star Treks Like honestly if you're gonna know but the Star Trek that everyone loves with Picard next generation.

760
00:45:14,189 --> 00:45:17,560
Speaker 0: now It has the same cheap feel that Mandalorian has.

761
00:45:17,761 --> 00:45:20,510
Speaker 0: that makes me not want to watch it and I don't see that at all.

762
00:45:20,530 --> 00:45:24,290
Speaker 1: But obviously the first two and a half seasons of TNG or garbage is don't watch him.

763
00:45:24,832 --> 00:45:26,119
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know which ones I've watched.

764
00:45:26,159 --> 00:45:30,194
Speaker 1: if you watch the phrase if there if there's this Beardless like shithead.

765
00:45:30,235 --> 00:45:31,198
Speaker 1: Here's the first officer.

766
00:45:31,479 --> 00:45:31,900
Speaker 1: It sucks.

767
00:45:32,242 --> 00:45:34,469
Speaker 0: Once the guy definitely watch sums that had Borg in them.

768
00:45:34,972 --> 00:45:36,927
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if that they were in the first season.

769
00:45:37,048 --> 00:45:37,370
Speaker 1: There's some.

770
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:41,827
Speaker 1: There are not great board of Borg episodes and there are later great Borg episodes.

771
00:45:42,048 --> 00:45:48,208
Speaker 0: The point is Mandalorian right started getting after the first two episodes which didn't really have it.

772
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:58,870
Speaker 0: Third fourth episode when I stopped watching started bringing in that feeling I get when I watch Live-action US television that I don't like and I just made me not want to watch anymore.

773
00:45:59,031 --> 00:46:00,889
Speaker 1: I think you're just a weird curmudgeon because I don't see it.

774
00:46:00,990 --> 00:46:07,469
Speaker 1: but there is a problem with the show that started in episode in the episode you didn't like and Then it doesn't happen for a while.

775
00:46:07,771 --> 00:46:13,190
Speaker 1: But it does happen two more times in the show and what it is is circular dialogue.

776
00:46:13,815 --> 00:46:26,030
Speaker 1: You know and the way I'll describe this, you know We're playing a burning wheel game and we us like two of us playing characters and like two NPCs Argue in a circle and Basically just keep saying the same things quick slightly.

777
00:46:26,111 --> 00:46:32,750
Speaker 1: So over and over again But nothing gets resolved and eventually the game master is like listen fuckers and hence this dice and makes us roll to resolve it.

778
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:44,367
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm the dialogue moves in a circle with characters basically just debating the same point repeatedly without moving anything forward multiple times before resolving it.

779
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:53,883
Speaker 1: and That happens in the episode that you didn't like where basically there's a bunch of characters talking And the camera basically goes from face to face to face to face.

780
00:46:54,366 --> 00:46:55,170
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, those are the words.

781
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,063
Speaker 0: Those are like the most those you seen.

782
00:46:57,123 --> 00:47:07,296
Speaker 1: those can be great Except when they go to a face that basically just says the same fucking thing again And does not that dialogue serves no actual purpose Like it's almost like they're just padding out the scene.

783
00:47:07,617 --> 00:47:14,499
Speaker 1: the game master meaning the director or the editor or someone should have just been like Yeah, let's just have the duel of wits guys.

784
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:15,121
Speaker 1: Come on.

785
00:47:15,282 --> 00:47:17,490
Speaker 1: It also gives that in the last episode.

786
00:47:17,631 --> 00:47:19,466
Speaker 1: There's like a really a second to last episode.

787
00:47:19,507 --> 00:47:22,149
Speaker 1: last episode There's like a big like really important scene.

788
00:47:23,258 --> 00:47:23,850
Speaker 1: It's egregious.

789
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:35,009
Speaker 1: there's a scene where the characters are debating whether or not to leave a certain character behind for plot reasons and they literally just Have the same conversation about this for like six minutes.

790
00:47:36,091 --> 00:47:37,056
Speaker 1: Nothing gets revealed.

791
00:47:37,157 --> 00:47:38,182
Speaker 1: No plot changes.

792
00:47:38,503 --> 00:47:39,910
Speaker 1: No characters change nothing.

793
00:47:39,970 --> 00:47:44,445
Speaker 1: It like an editor should have just cut that entire scene out and it would have showed a loss.

794
00:47:44,545 --> 00:47:44,887
Speaker 1: nothing.

795
00:47:45,288 --> 00:47:49,585
Speaker 1: and I think Circular dialogue is one thing.

796
00:47:49,645 --> 00:47:50,550
Speaker 1: It's not the only thing.

797
00:47:50,992 --> 00:47:54,168
Speaker 1: It's one thing that I think you bristle at even if you don't recognize it's happening.

798
00:47:54,269 --> 00:47:57,570
Speaker 0: maybe The other thing is that really?

799
00:47:58,671 --> 00:48:00,577
Speaker 0: That really like reminded me of like.

800
00:48:00,598 --> 00:48:02,785
Speaker 0: I was getting flashbacks while I was watching the show.

801
00:48:02,805 --> 00:48:03,428
Speaker 0: Yeah, isn't?

802
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:05,528
Speaker 0: I was a kid I actually liked.

803
00:48:06,972 --> 00:48:07,375
Speaker 0: It was so.

804
00:48:07,415 --> 00:48:12,282
Speaker 0: I liked him in the way that I like T man where once I learned better I realized like oh, why did I like that?

805
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:13,970
Speaker 0: That stuff is garbage, right?

806
00:48:14,853 --> 00:48:20,050
Speaker 0: I liked a lot of these cheap adventure shows that were a thing for a while, right like young Indiana Jones?

807
00:48:20,252 --> 00:48:21,409
Speaker 0: No, no, like that's a good.

808
00:48:23,952 --> 00:48:25,237
Speaker 1: I remember that show being good.

809
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:28,108
Speaker 1: I have not seen even one second of footage from it in my adult life.

810
00:48:28,289 --> 00:48:28,590
Speaker 0: I agree.

811
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:32,566
Speaker 1: Now shake that tree same cuz snakes are gonna buy out.

812
00:48:33,149 --> 00:48:36,819
Speaker 0: the shows I'm talking about are the xena warrior princess princess.

813
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:37,421
Speaker 1: I never liked.

814
00:48:37,441 --> 00:48:40,530
Speaker 0: you know, there was a Conan one Buffy.

815
00:48:40,791 --> 00:48:41,415
Speaker 0: I didn't.

816
00:48:41,456 --> 00:48:42,120
Speaker 0: I didn't watch Buffy.

817
00:48:42,482 --> 00:48:43,790
Speaker 1: Buffy was not worth watching.

818
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:48,254
Speaker 0: But there was a Briscoe County jr I did not like.

819
00:48:48,294 --> 00:48:51,303
Speaker 1: Briscoe County was always on when I was waiting to watch something else.

820
00:48:51,503 --> 00:48:53,850
Speaker 0: It was 99 lives of blackjack savage.

821
00:48:54,693 --> 00:48:55,757
Speaker 0: There was a. there's no one.

822
00:48:55,777 --> 00:48:56,761
Speaker 1: that looked like a lot.

823
00:48:56,902 --> 00:48:58,849
Speaker 0: It was a sin bad the sailor one.

824
00:48:59,812 --> 00:49:03,100
Speaker 0: But basically these shows were on and like bad time slots.

825
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:14,410
Speaker 0: You could see the most often like weekend afternoons on Not the main broadcast channel, but like your local channel that was like it's showing syndicated shows.

826
00:49:14,932 --> 00:49:24,188
Speaker 0: So like in New York, it would have been like 11 right or something like that Like your local like Connecticut channel as opposed to like actually NBC or some shit like that.

827
00:49:25,032 --> 00:49:28,830
Speaker 0: And those shows right some of them, right?

828
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:34,352
Speaker 0: We're just sort of that episodic adventure with bad acting kind of thing Right, sort of like.

829
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:41,008
Speaker 0: those are basically a pure essence of the thing that I dislike right distilled and it's like 200 proof.

830
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:48,778
Speaker 1: Now I will say I get zero of those vibes from the Mandalorian except in that one circular scene I talked about.

831
00:49:48,798 --> 00:49:49,870
Speaker 1: that was way too long.

832
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:52,739
Speaker 0: And you also see for example Briscoe County jr.

833
00:49:52,839 --> 00:49:58,141
Speaker 0: And also blackjack savage as examples of I Don't know if you have much Briscoe County jr.

834
00:49:58,181 --> 00:49:59,348
Speaker 0: Remember you said you didn't watch it.

835
00:49:59,972 --> 00:50:03,369
Speaker 1: Well, I always saw like the last five minutes of it before the thing I wanted to.

836
00:50:03,469 --> 00:50:12,304
Speaker 0: okay Okay But basically it was sort of X files II in the way that there was this main Secret from space plot that they'd barely address.

837
00:50:12,425 --> 00:50:13,390
Speaker 0: that they barely address.

838
00:50:13,410 --> 00:50:18,910
Speaker 0: So in Briscoe in X files It was always like what's up with the smoking man and that yeah, they find the ship.

839
00:50:19,133 --> 00:50:20,650
Speaker 1: Ah, but that's that's the curse.

840
00:50:20,971 --> 00:50:27,542
Speaker 1: I wanted to know about all that stuff for so long in the X files and then as soon as they showed it to me It was stupid and then I didn't care anymore exactly.

841
00:50:27,985 --> 00:50:31,760
Speaker 0: but in Bristol County jr it was this ball this metal ball with like.

842
00:50:31,801 --> 00:50:35,897
Speaker 0: that looked sort of like a I Don't know like you would take rods out of it.

843
00:50:35,937 --> 00:50:38,890
Speaker 0: I guess they were trying to evoke a nuclear device of some kind.

844
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:41,398
Speaker 1: That's just the fucking plot of the venture brothers.

845
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:43,365
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's a ball.

846
00:50:43,385 --> 00:50:44,047
Speaker 1: There's the orb.

847
00:50:44,589 --> 00:50:52,069
Speaker 0: the orb Anyway, you can probably find pictures of it online And it would only show up occasionally and most episodes weren't about it.

848
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:56,350
Speaker 0: And when it was about it, it would sort of like oh dang it got away again.

849
00:50:56,932 --> 00:50:59,160
Speaker 1: Okay, that orb looks way different from what I expected.

850
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,829
Speaker 0: yes, that's the thing that's like the main plot orb.

851
00:51:02,091 --> 00:51:03,438
Speaker 0: That's the main plot of the show.

852
00:51:03,539 --> 00:51:04,444
Speaker 0: Is that McGuffin?

853
00:51:04,464 --> 00:51:05,469
Speaker 1: Did they ever explain what it is?

854
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:12,944
Speaker 0: I don't remember gonna find out what in the 90s Anyway, but in that same way the Mandalorian has this core plot of.

855
00:51:12,964 --> 00:51:15,010
Speaker 0: what's the deal with the Mandalorians?

856
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:18,212
Speaker 0: what's deal with this baby, right and When?

857
00:51:18,373 --> 00:51:19,116
Speaker 0: that you know?

858
00:51:19,156 --> 00:51:20,401
Speaker 0: starting episode 3 and 4.

859
00:51:20,401 --> 00:51:22,650
Speaker 1: never fucking explain it in at any point.

860
00:51:22,891 --> 00:51:23,877
Speaker 0: No, the show got canceled.

861
00:51:23,897 --> 00:51:28,536
Speaker 1: before then, uh, the orb gets destroyed Sure, and there are three orbs.

862
00:51:28,837 --> 00:51:30,120
Speaker 0: Okay one gets destroyed.

863
00:51:30,140 --> 00:51:32,828
Speaker 1: The other two are taken back to the future by someone.

864
00:51:32,988 --> 00:51:40,810
Speaker 0: Okay, sure I guess there's time travel, you know, they make that terrible secret of space thin right while these other things happen, right?

865
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:46,310
Speaker 0: According to rim they unfin it, but I didn't see that far because I got bored and had better things to do.

866
00:51:46,560 --> 00:51:54,159
Speaker 1: Yeah I did not see any thinning in the Mandalorian because it sort of gets thicker as it goes on As soon as this motherfucker shows up.

867
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,888
Speaker 0: I did not see that motherfucker that guy.

868
00:51:55,908 --> 00:51:58,359
Speaker 1: so Werner Herzog is pretty fun.

869
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,408
Speaker 1: Like the role he plays this guy Is his boss?

870
00:52:02,991 --> 00:52:08,250
Speaker 1: Okay, and he basically show rolls into town like in the second half of the show and he's like the fuck is going on.

871
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:09,192
Speaker 1: Did you fuck this up?

872
00:52:09,513 --> 00:52:10,115

Speaker 1: He's a moth.

878
00:52:15,709 --> 00:52:18,695
Speaker 0: Oh It's a Star Wars.

879
00:52:18,815 --> 00:52:22,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was some fanservice but Moff Gideon is I think my.

880
00:52:22,866 --> 00:52:24,470
Speaker 0: that's only fanservice to nerds like us.

884
00:52:31,810 --> 00:52:33,636
Speaker 1: He doesn't even show up till episode 7.

885
00:52:33,636 --> 00:52:34,700
Speaker 1: He literally just shows up.

886
00:52:35,162 --> 00:52:37,289

895
00:52:54,515 --> 00:52:59,210
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah The way most people feel about Boba Fett is the way I felt about red storm as soon as I sold it.

896
00:52:59,250 --> 00:53:04,770
Speaker 1: I remember I was like my uncle was the nerdiest person in my family and I was like what's up with those red stormtroopers?

897
00:53:04,930 --> 00:53:05,292
Speaker 0: No one knows.

898
00:53:05,453 --> 00:53:07,303
Speaker 1: he didn't know so he made up a bunch of shit.

899
00:53:07,524 --> 00:53:08,932
Speaker 1: Okay, and it took me Way to go.

900
00:53:08,972 --> 00:53:09,838
Speaker 1: uncle he's awesome uncle.

901
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:16,044
Speaker 0: That's the difference between a boomer uncle and a millennial uncle.

902
00:53:16,104 --> 00:53:17,770
Speaker 0: boomer uncle will make up a bunch of bullshit.

903
00:53:17,891 --> 00:53:18,413
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

904
00:53:18,513 --> 00:53:22,270
Speaker 0: Whereas a millennial uncle will actually tell you the truth because they googled a fuck ton about it.

905
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:25,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they'll go on and on and on telling you everything there is to know about those red guys for real.

906
00:53:26,512 --> 00:53:30,026
Speaker 1: I wanted to know the deal with those red guys so bad as a kid.

907
00:53:30,167 --> 00:53:36,810
Speaker 1: Yep, but Yeah, that the month showing up is pretty great and it's only four more episodes.

908
00:53:37,292 --> 00:53:39,500
Speaker 1: He shows up in episode seven if you want to see what his deal is.

Speaker 1: It is gonna set up a pretty good season two.

912
00:53:47,692 --> 00:53:49,578
Speaker 0: I wish they would make a Star Wars show.

913
00:53:49,658 --> 00:53:52,929
Speaker 0: It's about space pilot and not about you know.

914
00:53:53,581 --> 00:53:53,950

Speaker 0: what's the word for it?

921
00:54:07,131 --> 00:54:08,355
Speaker 0: Like their pet project like.

922
00:54:08,375 --> 00:54:11,567
Speaker 0: no, we really want to make, you know an homage to Kurosawa.

923
00:54:11,627 --> 00:54:12,450
Speaker 0: All right, let's just do it.

924
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:13,153
Speaker 0: Let's have like.

925
00:54:13,173 --> 00:54:16,910
Speaker 0: they're having the fun making what they want to make as filmmakers.

926
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:21,566
Speaker 0: So find someone who really wants to make regardless of what Scott wants to see.

929
00:54:26,325 --> 00:54:29,949
Speaker 1: I want to see one a show That's about like one fucking TIE fighter pilot.

930
00:54:31,172 --> 00:54:35,249
Speaker 1: I'd like to see one that is Our boy out in the Outer Rim.

931
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:37,455
Speaker 1: Okay, Vice Admiral Thrawn.

932
00:54:37,616 --> 00:54:38,639

Speaker 1: I think it'll happen.

935
00:54:40,827 --> 00:54:41,670
Speaker 1: I'd like to see a Thrawn.

936
00:54:41,932 --> 00:54:43,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what else I really want to see.

937
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:47,276
Speaker 1: hmm What do you want?

938
00:54:47,397 --> 00:54:47,861
Speaker 1: What do you want?

939
00:54:47,881 --> 00:54:49,090
Speaker 1: That would be Mandalorian adjacent?

940
00:54:49,330 --> 00:54:53,590
Speaker 1: Like the most fan service things Star Wars could give you personally me personally.

941
00:54:53,632 --> 00:55:01,863
Speaker 1: Yeah Like if you got to direct what the what the pet project would have been for the people who ended up making the Mandalorian Vixen wedge like their whole lives.

942
00:55:02,144 --> 00:55:02,909
Speaker 0: No, I would do.

943
00:55:04,411 --> 00:55:07,581
Speaker 0: It would still be space battles because you gotta have space battle.

944
00:55:07,621 --> 00:55:10,008
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but we'd be focusing on.

945
00:55:10,028 --> 00:55:14,070
Speaker 0: you know What's going on on one ship the way not in the way Star Trek though?

946
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:21,710
Speaker 0: Like Gundam seed made the way Gundam does but the main character right would not be a lame.

947
00:55:22,191 --> 00:55:25,563
Speaker 0: Oh, you know blank Gundam character, right?

948
00:55:25,583 --> 00:55:27,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, like one of the Battlestar Galactica pilots.

949
00:55:27,730 --> 00:55:34,038
Speaker 0: No, no, no the really the main character has to be one of those droids that has too much character That would normally be.

950
00:55:34,058 --> 00:55:37,513
Speaker 0: is that would normally be a side character Killed quickly.

951
00:55:38,255 --> 00:55:39,981
Speaker 0: Yeah, right like the one in.

952
00:55:40,302 --> 00:55:44,236
Speaker 0: well the one in Mandalorian or the one in What's it called?

953
00:55:44,297 --> 00:55:45,709
Speaker 1: All I'm gonna say is that droid comes back.

954
00:55:46,611 --> 00:55:47,192
Speaker 0: I'm sure it does.

955
00:55:47,413 --> 00:55:52,888
Speaker 1: also that droid the one you're talking about gives me mad return to Oz creepy voice.

956
00:55:52,928 --> 00:55:56,013
Speaker 0: What's the Rogue?

957
00:55:56,093 --> 00:55:58,223
Speaker 0: rogue, whatever the droid in that one also a cool.

958
00:55:58,384 --> 00:55:59,630
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that guy like that droid a lot.

959
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:01,657
Speaker 0: Yeah, just take me a cool droid like that.

960
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:02,941
Speaker 0: That's the main character.

961
00:56:03,001 --> 00:56:05,570
Speaker 0: make a Gundam setup where you're focusing on one ship.

962
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:07,928
Speaker 1: Yeah, like one Mon Calamari cruiser, right?

963
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:12,930
Speaker 0: Exactly right with a bunch of fighters right that I'll see the equivalent of the Gundams rise.

964
00:56:12,970 --> 00:56:13,835
Speaker 0: You have this whole cast.

965
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:14,780
Speaker 0: that's on the one ship.

966
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:22,016
Speaker 0: It's like a Gundam not like a Star Trek Yeah, and but the main character has to be an awesome Hilarious character with a lot.

967
00:56:22,077 --> 00:56:24,948
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like it and a droid and not some lame.

968
00:56:25,069 --> 00:56:27,510
Speaker 1: Oh Well, you need three parts.

969
00:56:27,570 --> 00:56:32,430
Speaker 1: You need the the ensemble cast of people to do the cuts to the faces when there's a space battle, correct?

970
00:56:32,550 --> 00:56:34,018
Speaker 1: You need the character you described.

971
00:56:34,078 --> 00:56:36,370
Speaker 1: is the real main character to like pull everything together?

972
00:56:36,470 --> 00:56:38,840
Speaker 0: You need the evil Empire character in a mask.

973
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:39,142
Speaker 0: Yep.

974
00:56:39,423 --> 00:56:42,895
Speaker 1: And then you need the Probably a Jedi.

975
00:56:43,337 --> 00:56:46,390
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, everyone need these new types are Jedi's obviously, of course.

976
00:56:46,791 --> 00:56:51,289
Speaker 1: But then in the background of the ship you need the irresponsible captain Tyler.

977
00:56:52,491 --> 00:56:57,050
Speaker 1: You're under arrest slash pat labore cast of idiots and side characters.

978
00:56:57,191 --> 00:57:09,423
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, we're just always in the background capering and fucking things up and getting drunk and causing trouble Yep, and then they need to be on a journey a slow journey from point a to point B Like they are in a Gundam or macross or whatever.

979
00:57:09,745 --> 00:57:17,250
Speaker 0: We're like, okay We're leaving this planet and we have you know, the problem is they have warp drive and in Star Wars that fucks that all up.

980
00:57:17,431 --> 00:57:21,030
Speaker 0: Yeah, the other thing you could do in Star Wars that would totally work.

981
00:57:21,110 --> 00:57:22,094
Speaker 0: But actually I don't want it.

982
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:25,748
Speaker 0: cuz like I don't I don't need more of it is to do a Galaxy Express.

983
00:57:26,311 --> 00:57:27,297
Speaker 0: There's some sort of.

984
00:57:27,499 --> 00:57:37,369
Speaker 0: you're focusing on like, you know Couple mysterious people making a long journey and they basically go in hyperspace and then land on Star Wars planets and have moral Quandary.

985
00:57:38,292 --> 00:57:40,870
Speaker 1: Right on Tatooine right when it's about to have it's like workers.

986
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:46,070
Speaker 0: They land on somewhere where the moral quandary and at the end of the episode they get back onto the space.

987
00:57:46,130 --> 00:57:48,690
Speaker 0: So here's the question and it warps them to the next place.

988
00:57:48,811 --> 00:57:51,302
Speaker 1: Are these two characters starting in the part of Star Wars?

989
00:57:51,362 --> 00:57:53,110
Speaker 1: We know and going out to the Outer Rim?

990
00:57:53,412 --> 00:57:56,110
Speaker 0: So it doesn't even matter just give more moral quandary.

991
00:57:56,130 --> 00:58:02,030
Speaker 1: Are they out in the Outer Rim trying to come in to like meet Yoda not knowing that Yoda's dead?

992
00:58:02,110 --> 00:58:02,914
Speaker 1: Everything's been destroyed?

993
00:58:03,316 --> 00:58:05,606
Speaker 1: doesn't matter spoilers Yoda dies guys.

994
00:58:05,948 --> 00:58:07,777
Speaker 1: Oh, no Yeah, also spoilers.

995
00:58:07,797 --> 00:58:08,801
Speaker 1: We haven't seen the Mandalorian.

996
00:58:09,062 --> 00:58:12,076
Speaker 1: That's not literally Yoda It's just the race that Yoda is.

997
00:58:12,096 --> 00:58:15,030
Speaker 1: yeah, like obviously because it takes place after Episode six.

998
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:20,929
Speaker 1: Yeah, but what the other thing I really like about it and it comes out a lot more in the second half the show is You didn't see much of it yet.

999
00:58:21,871 --> 00:58:23,840
Speaker 1: The baby is really powerful obvious.

1000
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:30,362
Speaker 1: I saw that it's obvious and really dangerous and Not necessarily actually good like it might not know.

1001
00:58:30,583 --> 00:58:31,306
Speaker 0: it was just born.

1002
00:58:31,347 --> 00:58:31,969
Speaker 0: What does it know?

1003
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:36,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it might not be okay for this baby to go where it's supposed to go in the end.

1004
00:58:36,871 --> 00:58:37,395
Speaker 0: Well, you can't?

1005
00:58:37,415 --> 00:58:38,543
Speaker 0: you don't know anything right?

1006
00:58:38,563 --> 00:58:39,127
Speaker 0: You know, you'll.

1007
00:58:40,311 --> 00:58:42,120
Speaker 1: Season one tells you a lot more.

1008
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:42,743
Speaker 0: You don't know any.

1009
00:58:42,763 --> 00:58:44,230
Speaker 0: we don't know anything about Yoda's race.

1010
00:58:44,431 --> 00:58:46,260
Speaker 0: We don't know anything about right.

1011
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:47,003
Speaker 0: We just know all right.

1012
00:58:47,044 --> 00:58:53,387
Speaker 0: It's a baby of Yoda's race Yeah, and it has mad strong with the force and does it even have parents?

1013
00:58:53,487 --> 00:58:54,210
Speaker 0: What does it think?

1014
00:58:54,470 --> 00:58:55,093
Speaker 0: What is it right?

1015
00:58:55,114 --> 00:58:55,797
Speaker 0: Does it candidate?

1016
00:58:55,878 --> 00:58:58,030
Speaker 0: it must have ideas is like I don't you know.

1017
00:58:58,672 --> 00:59:04,430
Speaker 0: The end of season one actually kind of explains what you can't really communicate in a way that the audience can understand.

1018
00:59:04,671 --> 00:59:09,003
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the baby of a real interesting in season two.

1019
00:59:09,364 --> 00:59:11,530
Speaker 1: Mmm, and I will watch season two when it comes out.

1020
00:59:11,731 --> 00:59:14,260
Speaker 0: I like you know if they follow the lone wolf and cub trend.

1021
00:59:14,521 --> 00:59:16,730
Speaker 0: right you think lone wolf and cub is this dude?

1022
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,424
Speaker 0: I've read most of it.

1023
00:59:18,505 --> 00:59:21,950
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just episodic samurai stories, right?

1024
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:25,029
Speaker 0: But it's like yeah, the kid is actually isn't just like this.

1025
00:59:25,532 --> 00:59:35,970
Speaker 0: You know baby in a carriage that he has to protect and keep it from getting killed like the kid You know at points fucking cuts people Oh kid goes out and does things even though it doesn't really talk a lot.

1026
00:59:36,311 --> 00:59:41,590
Speaker 0: Right, like the kid is actually like, you know a real deal that happens more and more in the second.

1027
00:59:41,670 --> 00:59:43,857
Speaker 0: It's like imagine imagine like a bear cub.

1028
00:59:44,158 --> 00:59:49,924
Speaker 0: that's like, you know, not just born but like been around a little bit But it's still a cub like, you know, I can hear that.

1029
00:59:49,964 --> 00:59:50,809
Speaker 0: is she gonna fuck you up?

1030
00:59:51,472 --> 00:59:52,196
Speaker 0: It's not a bear.

1031
00:59:52,216 --> 01:00:02,380
Speaker 0: it won't like maul you but it you don't want to go near it Right, and that's basically what the deal is, but I mean in the end like I really like Mandalorian I will watch season two as soon as it comes out.

1032
01:00:02,400 --> 01:00:05,949
Speaker 0: Mmm, and Yeah, it's a pretty good show.

1033
01:00:06,151 --> 01:00:13,530
Speaker 1: I do I enjoyed it more viscerally than I enjoyed the newer Star Wars movies But I don't think that I'm saying I did not like the new Star Wars movies.

1034
01:00:14,252 --> 01:00:20,510
Speaker 1: I think it's mostly that the Mandalorian is set closer to like the aesthetic of the first trilogy, which I like the most.

1035
01:00:20,651 --> 01:00:20,711
Speaker 1: I

1036
01:00:20,771 --> 01:00:30,252
Speaker 0: think the new movies at their best moments I liked a zillion times more than Mandalorian, but at their man moments, I'd liked less than Yeah,

1037
01:00:30,473 --> 01:00:36,418
Speaker 1: I can I can feel that like for that one of the movies like that casino thing was just real bad And that you should not been in the movie.

1038
01:00:36,438 --> 01:00:37,586
Speaker 1: and I would like that movie a lot more.

1039
01:00:38,590 --> 01:00:41,930
Speaker 0: Mmm part even in the casino part which was mostly man.

1040
01:00:42,412 --> 01:00:43,598
Speaker 1: It had it had a few moments.

1041
01:00:43,699 --> 01:00:48,562
Speaker 0: a few moments of the casino thing were not me Yeah, but 90% of the casino part was met.

1042
01:00:48,662 --> 01:00:49,948
Speaker 1: Yep, but there were some not met moments.

1043
01:00:49,968 --> 01:00:56,248
Speaker 0: I will give you that Yeah, Mandalorian better than casino not as good as space battle where they crash one ship in another ship.

1044
01:00:56,469 --> 01:00:58,016
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, but you know what?

1045
01:00:58,036 --> 01:00:58,479

Speaker 1: the audio.

1048
01:01:00,810 --> 01:01:03,830
Speaker 1: It's the difference between the root mean square volume and the peak volume.

1049
01:01:03,990 --> 01:01:08,689
Speaker 1: Yep, the new movies have really good peaks, but also a lot of really like low volume sections.
