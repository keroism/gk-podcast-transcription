Speaker 0: what how do you get that title?

10
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,570
Speaker 2: I mean, maybe as opposed to wrong.

11
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:44,718
Speaker 1: I think it's for judges right.

12
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:47,530
Speaker 1: the wrong Judges are right honorable, right?

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:47,851

Speaker 0: Do I wear the robes?

15
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:50,120
Speaker 0: Am I wearing robes right now guys?

16
00:00:50,420 --> 00:00:51,223
Speaker 2: Oh, yes, you could be.

17
00:00:51,585 --> 00:00:53,412
Speaker 2: I have just right in that closet.

18
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:58,907
Speaker 1: No, you have a like Close enough to nothing like.

19
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,934
Speaker 1: it's nothing like a judge's robe.

20
00:01:00,974 --> 00:01:01,717
Speaker 1: It's not even close.

21
00:01:01,757 --> 00:01:03,685
Speaker 2: It's very close Not even almost the same.

22
00:01:03,705 --> 00:01:05,975
Speaker 0: Yeah any someone who calling this meeting to order?

23
00:01:05,995 --> 00:01:06,658
Speaker 0: All right.

24
00:01:07,841 --> 00:01:16,081
Speaker 2: So the reason we brought her eyes we brought Luke in here is partly because I'm actually in Japan right now But and we needed a Tuesday show filler.

25
00:01:16,624 --> 00:01:19,920
Speaker 2: more importantly burning apocalypse con is actually nigh.

26
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,992
Speaker 2: In fact, I'm gonna get back from Japan and then go to that the next weekend.

27
00:01:23,072 --> 00:01:25,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've mentioned this in the show many times.

28
00:01:25,822 --> 00:01:26,846
Speaker 1: Burning apocalypse con is 11 11 11.

29
00:01:26,846 --> 00:01:28,491
Speaker 1: I guess that's the date, you know.

30
00:01:31,703 --> 00:01:32,988
Speaker 1: And it's not just burning.

31
00:01:33,028 --> 00:01:34,474
Speaker 1: It's also apocalypse, right?

32
00:01:34,655 --> 00:01:44,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Last year for those of you who might remember last year On 10 10 10 it already feels like that was more than a year ago.

33
00:01:44,913 --> 00:01:44,994
Speaker 0: Yeah.

34
00:01:45,114 --> 00:01:46,679
Speaker 0: Well, it was a little bit was about.

35
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,169
Speaker 1: Okay, I guess it was but it feels like three years.

36
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:51,891
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

37
00:01:52,011 --> 00:02:00,300
Speaker 0: so yeah last year during cuz comic-con camped on my date, but anyway Last year at the weekend of 10 10 10 we ran a small con out here in a story.

38
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:07,651
Speaker 0: It was about 50 people and we played only burning wheel Mouse Guard Then burning empires through the whole weekend and it was really.

39
00:02:07,671 --> 00:02:09,539
Speaker 0: it was way more fun than it should have been.

40
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,624
Speaker 2: It was pretty intense.

41
00:02:10,684 --> 00:02:13,977
Speaker 2: I had not played burning wheel and that like concentration ever in my life.

42
00:02:14,198 --> 00:02:17,699
Speaker 0: Yeah So I think that was the case for most people.

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,499
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like usually go to a con you're lucky to play once little load and five or six times.

44
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,345
Speaker 0: yeah, so it kind of.

45
00:02:23,726 --> 00:02:32,675
Speaker 0: and we we developed a like a priority system for getting into games and And we had people come from all over the world and it just had a good feel to it.

46
00:02:33,198 --> 00:02:39,120
Speaker 0: So as Everyone knows your second album always sells worse than your.

47
00:02:41,742 --> 00:02:52,359
Speaker 0: So I was trying to think of a way to To do the second year and give it a boost rather than just kind of be like, oh, I've already done that I don't you know, I don't need to do that again.

48
00:02:52,641 --> 00:03:05,705
Speaker 0: So I invited my friend Vincent Baker who is the author and designer of dogs in the vineyard Kill puppies for Satan a bunch of other games and apocalypse world and I said hey, let's so.

49
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:06,889
Speaker 0: so these like.

50
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,876
Speaker 0: so the convention is now like curated.

51
00:03:08,896 --> 00:03:10,100
Speaker 0: This is the new hip word.

52
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,747
Speaker 0: It's it's a curated.

53
00:03:11,788 --> 00:03:12,938
Speaker 0: basically you run.

54
00:03:14,581 --> 00:03:16,511
Speaker 0: You know, you can only run a selection of these games.

55
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,760
Speaker 0: There's like, you know, ten games that you can run it though I know you put an other option.

56
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:26,146
Speaker 2: So of course I immediately submitted with a game that wasn't on any of the lists that was made by Jared Just for fun to see if you'd accept it.

57
00:03:26,206 --> 00:03:26,387
Speaker 0: Yeah.

58
00:03:26,467 --> 00:03:27,571
Speaker 0: No, so when?

59
00:03:27,871 --> 00:03:28,273
Speaker 0: and it's.

60
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:34,979
Speaker 0: I didn't want the other option in there But my programmer because programmers just don't listen they always put another they do it.

61
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,832
Speaker 0: So he put it up there but he's vindicated.

62
00:03:40,852 --> 00:03:42,500
Speaker 0: today somebody submitted a game that I didn't think of.

63
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,954
Speaker 0: Somebody submitted Rock of Tahamut, which is one of Vincent's small experimental games.

64
00:03:48,054 --> 00:03:48,495
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

65
00:03:48,816 --> 00:03:50,000
Speaker 0: So that's really cool.

66
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,009
Speaker 0: So now we have a rock of Tom out of.

67
00:03:51,029 --> 00:03:52,119
Speaker 0: would it be okay to play?

68
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:53,542
Speaker 1: Arabian nice.

69
00:03:53,582 --> 00:03:54,505
Speaker 1: didn't his wife make that?

70
00:03:54,826 --> 00:03:56,853
Speaker 0: that is a Megway Baker game.

71
00:03:56,953 --> 00:03:57,736
Speaker 0: Not a Vincent Baker game.

72
00:03:57,856 --> 00:03:58,178
Speaker 0: Okay.

73
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:01,404
Speaker 1: There you go Vincent's name.

74
00:04:01,565 --> 00:04:03,960
Speaker 0: basically his name has to be in the design credits for it.

75
00:04:04,221 --> 00:04:07,459
Speaker 0: Like somebody wanted to play dungeon your name or my name, right?

76
00:04:08,461 --> 00:04:12,611
Speaker 0: Somebody wanted to play dungeon world, which is a hack of one of his games But his name isn't in the design credits.

77
00:04:12,631 --> 00:04:14,140
Speaker 0: like he didn't actually work on the design.

78
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:21,505
Speaker 2: Well the fact that you even got to the point of thinking about that case that scenario of the mod of the game Someone probably submitted it right?

79
00:04:21,545 --> 00:04:28,177
Speaker 0: That's probably why well someone asked right away, but I mean I had thought about it beforehand like yeah Your name's gonna be in the credit.

80
00:04:28,217 --> 00:04:35,560
Speaker 0: So So Yeah, so we're gonna have probably between 70 and 80 people this time in man, Manhattan.

81
00:04:36,681 --> 00:04:40,237
Speaker 0: Okay, you're at 440 studios right 40 the same place that they do recess.

82
00:04:40,438 --> 00:04:57,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Yeah, we're gonna do a party on November 11th and then November 12th and 13th, we'll have games all day Down there, so we'll have five slots of games and just like last year you run one session and you play four sessions And it's gonna be a good time

83
00:04:58,422 --> 00:05:07,859
Speaker 1: All right, so what would you say to someone who is like, you know, maybe not familiar with you know Luke crane or Vincent Baker like should they even come now the game now?

84
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:12,615
Speaker 0: No, straight up don't don't show us just chill out go go to recess or something.

85
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:13,920
Speaker 0: There are other other events.

86
00:05:15,202 --> 00:05:19,580
Speaker 0: It's not a good environment for someone who doesn't know what they want to walk into.

87
00:05:19,982 --> 00:05:29,088
Speaker 0: I mean unless they're just really outgoing really forward really, you know interested in this stuff, but Because you got to run a game So it's hardcore on purpose.

88
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:31,800
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and you just you want it that way and you're fine with it.

89
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,180
Speaker 1: You're not going forget as many people to show up as possible.

90
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:37,260
Speaker 0: I don't want people to come to this to slouch and just be like.

91
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:41,250
Speaker 0: I want people to come to this and be challenged, right?

92
00:05:41,271 --> 00:05:45,969
Speaker 0: I want them to be challenged and stand like just to Raise themselves up to run a game.

93
00:05:46,029 --> 00:05:47,034
Speaker 0: I mean I had this last year.

94
00:05:47,336 --> 00:05:48,080
Speaker 0: I was totally right.

95
00:05:48,462 --> 00:05:55,240
Speaker 0: I demanded people run games and that that were like, I don't know I don't know and they did and they had a great time and they learned a lot.

96
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:03,117
Speaker 0: And like there's this whole mystique about running a game that it's hard or that it's required special skills.

97
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:03,999
Speaker 0: It's such a bullshit.

98
00:06:04,722 --> 00:06:07,533
Speaker 0: And people I get this all the time people tell me about your gming.

99
00:06:07,955 --> 00:06:08,638
Speaker 0: Why do you do this?

100
00:06:08,678 --> 00:06:09,220
Speaker 0: How do you GM?

101
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,125
Speaker 0: I'm like, I don't know.

102
00:06:10,145 --> 00:06:11,112
Speaker 0: I just run games.

103
00:06:11,273 --> 00:06:12,159
Speaker 0: You should run games.

104
00:06:12,562 --> 00:06:25,209
Speaker 1: Well, I think I think that's you know, the problem I've seen in GM I mean at least you know personally is like in order to get good at it You have to do it a lot, but it to do it a lot starting from never having done it You have to do it a lot badly first.

105
00:06:25,369 --> 00:06:27,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, which means people have to suffer in your crappy games.

106
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,954
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like if you're if you're a bad to get art it to be an artist.

107
00:06:30,974 --> 00:06:37,974
Speaker 1: you draw a bunch of crappy drawings But no one else is to suffer them Right, but it did to be a GM to get your practice.

108
00:06:38,115 --> 00:06:39,180
Speaker 1: other people have to you know.

109
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:41,791
Speaker 1: So it's the people who started GM in high school could win.

110
00:06:41,992 --> 00:06:45,727
Speaker 1: when your high school friends didn't care about your bad GMing that got good at it.

111
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:46,832
Speaker 2: Oh, they cared that.

112
00:06:46,932 --> 00:06:48,800
Speaker 2: I'm an infamous GM from high school, right?

113
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,120
Speaker 1: But if you start when you're older, you know, 20 30 year old people aren't gonna put up with this first time GM.

114
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,044
Speaker 1: They don't have time for that.

115
00:06:56,386 --> 00:06:59,340
Speaker 0: So so yeah, I definitely see what you're saying.

116
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:03,517
Speaker 0: And you know just like any skill you start younger earlier and you keep practicing it.

117
00:07:03,537 --> 00:07:04,872
Speaker 0: You're gonna be good at it You're better at it.

118
00:07:05,982 --> 00:07:20,938
Speaker 0: but in this the environment that we have here where everyone knows that everyone has to run a game and That most people are familiar with most of the games you get great players supporting You know kind of timid GMs and you can and they can.

119
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:21,420
Speaker 0: they help them.

120
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:25,900
Speaker 0: They they drive the games forward and they they raise the quality of the whole event.

121
00:07:26,101 --> 00:07:26,604
Speaker 0: That is something

122
00:07:26,644 --> 00:07:43,420
Speaker 2: I see when I see people playing burning wheel that I never saw with D&D Where the game master flubs a rule or doesn't really know what to do and the players make suggestions like oh You should make him roll this or no, that's clearly Whatever skill as opposed to jump because he's doing this one thing and the GM's often go along with it because it makes sense.

123
00:07:43,682 --> 00:07:44,937
Speaker 2: Yeah, you never see that in D&D.

124
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:45,601
Speaker 2: No It's like.

125
00:07:45,622 --> 00:07:49,444
Speaker 1: I mean this, you know, well that happens to us all the times like that's not sword That's it.

126
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:51,720
Speaker 1: that happens to us pretty much every time we've been playing recently.

127
00:07:51,841 --> 00:07:55,900
Speaker 2: No, that happens to us because you and are basically the backseat game master.

128
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,167
Speaker 1: Well, no, but we're always like.

129
00:07:57,187 --> 00:07:59,318
Speaker 1: we're always like what skills should we use?

130
00:07:59,358 --> 00:08:01,594
Speaker 1: and we're like It's the game of what skill and it's like.

131
00:08:01,614 --> 00:08:02,319
Speaker 1: well, how about this one?

132
00:08:03,603 --> 00:08:05,520
Speaker 1: You know, is that really composition?

133
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,589
Speaker 2: I mean, she's just trying to write for someone.

134
00:08:07,649 --> 00:08:08,713
Speaker 1: right that just happened.

135
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,139
Speaker 1: It was composition or writing.

136
00:08:11,361 --> 00:08:14,292
Speaker 2: Yeah, we had a failed write test followed by a failed read test.

137
00:08:14,352 --> 00:08:15,657
Speaker 2: It was awesome.

138
00:08:15,677 --> 00:08:16,259
Speaker 0: Those are good ones.

139
00:08:17,342 --> 00:08:22,380
Speaker 0: yeah, burning wheels a little skilly but and I do the same thing and we we.

140
00:08:23,861 --> 00:08:32,628
Speaker 0: So I'll usually keep my mouth shut up to a point until because I because if I speak up everyone like listens Which is oh you have life, but that's what we want.

141
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:34,174
Speaker 0: We want you to write.

142
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:38,698
Speaker 0: No, no one should listen to me Just play the goddamn game as I wrote it.

143
00:08:40,087 --> 00:08:42,460
Speaker 0: so But but we'll do that in my group too.

144
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:47,577
Speaker 0: We'll make suggestions and and so right because the rules are meant to be transparent and it's just it's.

145
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,286
Speaker 0: there's not meant to be Any mystique to it?

146
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:52,523
Speaker 0: So the Yeah, there's not.

147
00:08:52,623 --> 00:08:56,177
Speaker 0: it's not like the GM has this kind of final say or anything like that.

148
00:08:56,478 --> 00:09:03,323
Speaker 0: I'm gonna burp and And So.

149
00:09:03,727 --> 00:09:13,100
Speaker 0: so anyway, so you you just get You you get games in public which are better for it, you know especially if everyone's kind of open to input because

150
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:17,255
Speaker 1: if I don't know what skill to use this someone at the next table who maybe knows

151
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:22,576
Speaker 0: sure but also like Like we expect the GM to say hey, well, you're stuck for an idea.

152
00:09:22,596 --> 00:09:23,680
Speaker 0: Why don't you do this?

153
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:27,135
Speaker 0: I see no reason why the you know, the GM stuck for an idea.

154
00:09:27,155 --> 00:09:29,826
Speaker 0: the players can't say Hey, you know, why not try this?

155
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:30,267
Speaker 0: So

156
00:09:30,288 --> 00:09:42,805
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm actually you know, since the con is gonna be so hardcore I'm actually kind of got to do a lot of reading because I own all the Vincent's games But I actually don't know how to play almost any Doing some reading

157
00:09:42,825 --> 00:09:48,189
Speaker 2: to bring them up at conventions like we'll do a panel like hey all the indie RPGs We always mention all his games and all your games and

158
00:09:48,229 --> 00:09:48,912
Speaker 1: it's like I own.

159
00:09:48,932 --> 00:09:51,824
Speaker 2: I give him the two-sentence summary of each one But I haven't.

160
00:09:52,085 --> 00:09:53,411
Speaker 1: it's like I own apocalypse world.

161
00:09:53,512 --> 00:09:55,300
Speaker 1: I've haven't I don't think I've read a single page of it.

162
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:56,806
Speaker 2: I've never run enough free market.

163
00:09:56,886 --> 00:09:58,331
Speaker 2: Even I've only played it with you.

164
00:09:58,352 --> 00:09:58,693
Speaker 2: Yeah.

165
00:09:59,175 --> 00:09:59,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got it.

166
00:09:59,817 --> 00:10:00,480
Speaker 1: We got to work on that.

167
00:10:00,982 --> 00:10:02,891
Speaker 0: So yeah, I think that's great.

168
00:10:02,951 --> 00:10:04,820
Speaker 0: I think that we're all gonna challenge myself included.

169
00:10:05,122 --> 00:10:07,213
Speaker 0: I have not yet sat down to play apocalypse world.

170
00:10:07,253 --> 00:10:11,209
Speaker 0: I read it and I you know, I'd love to play it.

171
00:10:11,229 --> 00:10:11,995
Speaker 0: I love the genre.

172
00:10:12,398 --> 00:10:15,729
Speaker 0: So You know there and we have a good mix of games right now.

173
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:18,659
Speaker 0: We have you know, four or five free market games.

174
00:10:18,719 --> 00:10:24,620
Speaker 0: We have No, well a bunch of a bunch of burning wheel a bunch apocalypse world some, you know mouse guard one burning empires game.

175
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:32,632
Speaker 0: Whoa Yeah, I'm excited the the scenario That he pitched me is really good.

176
00:10:33,197 --> 00:10:38,735
Speaker 0: So And then just a smattering of other stuff a couple dogs games a couple in a wicked age games.

177
00:10:38,755 --> 00:10:41,546
Speaker 1: I Never even heard of any wicked agent.

178
00:10:41,566 --> 00:10:42,752
Speaker 1: I got something to buy.

179
00:10:42,772 --> 00:10:43,858
Speaker 0: That's one of his.

180
00:10:44,059 --> 00:10:46,327
Speaker 0: yeah He'll you can buy it at the con.

181
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:48,095
Speaker 0: He'll have a lot of stuff there.

182
00:10:48,577 --> 00:11:16,327
Speaker 0: So yeah, one more thing I wanted to talk about for 11 11 11 for the the burning apocalypse con is that Tragically one of our really close friends one of the editors of the burning wheel books and one of the GM's for burning apocalypse con had a severe stroke and He is been hospitalized for the past two weeks and will be hospitalized For probably a couple more.

183
00:11:16,367 --> 00:11:18,960
Speaker 0: he's recovering and he's and they're saying he's gonna make a full recovery.

184
00:11:19,081 --> 00:11:21,060
Speaker 0: But no, it's a rather traumatic experience.

185
00:11:22,401 --> 00:11:25,070
Speaker 0: He was a key for the past two weeks.

186
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:27,499
Speaker 0: He's been paralyzed, you know the left side of his body.

187
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:46,972
Speaker 0: so I wanted to let everyone know that for 11 11 11 we're going to Use it as a fundraising event to help him try to pay his bills and that I'm gonna produce a custom mouse guard hack Hopefully for 11 11 11 if not then shortly thereafter Since there's a lot of planning to do in addition to writing.

188
00:11:46,992 --> 00:11:51,960
Speaker 2: pretty sure if you don't make it by 11 11 11 You'll be able to take pledges and I'm pretty sure people will commit to it.

189
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm gonna make a custom hack and then the proceeds from that will.

190
00:11:55,974 --> 00:11:59,345
Speaker 0: we will split them between My friend and myself.

191
00:11:59,566 --> 00:12:04,086
Speaker 1: now that the hack isn't gonna be only available at 11 11 level though You know, no, no internet for everybody.

192
00:12:04,126 --> 00:12:04,488
Speaker 0: It'll be up.

193
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:04,809
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
00:12:04,829 --> 00:12:04,990
Speaker 0: Yeah.

195
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:05,411
Speaker 0: Yeah.

196
00:12:05,451 --> 00:12:05,993
Speaker 0: Yeah.

197
00:12:06,214 --> 00:12:08,579
Speaker 0: I mean at 11 11 11 It's gonna be a pile of notes.

198
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:15,840
Speaker 2: So at the very end you got to take that pile of notes and then sell that at a charity auction at like magfest.

199
00:12:16,742 --> 00:12:22,124
Speaker 2: That's not bad, I mean the rape clock went for like 700.

200
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:26,923
Speaker 1: You just make sure make sure that when you put it up there That you let it instead, you know Don't set a price.

201
00:12:26,984 --> 00:12:30,036
Speaker 1: make it like pay what you want because there'll be people who will give more.

202
00:12:30,056 --> 00:12:34,212
Speaker 1: right if you make it five Bucks someone's like, oh, you know rather than buy two for ten bucks.

203
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,260
Speaker 1: They'll just want to give you 20 for the one.

204
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:39,092
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I was thinking that basically yeah, it's gonna be a pay what you want.

205
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:40,699
Speaker 0: scheme for the hack.

206
00:12:40,739 --> 00:12:47,547
Speaker 2: Yeah Yeah, well, I mean even non charity purely commercial ventures that do that tend to go do very well Right, right.

207
00:12:47,707 --> 00:12:50,980
Speaker 0: So yeah, I figured you guys would want to know and your listeners might want to know too.

208
00:12:51,223 --> 00:13:00,532
Speaker 0: Yeah, so yeah if you like the way burning wheel books are edited if you like the fact that the lists are alphabetized and All the weapon stats are you know, correct and stuff like that.

209
00:13:00,573 --> 00:13:00,934
Speaker 0: It's this.

210
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:02,480
Speaker 0: this is the guy that does all that editing.

211
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:07,588
Speaker 0: he's the guy who does the really niche II stuff that make sure everything's in order and The stuff that most people don't think about.

212
00:13:07,648 --> 00:13:09,579
Speaker 2: you guys now surprisingly important to my life.

213
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:14,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, the the stuff that that you would be surprised you'd think that Luke Crane could do that.

214
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:22,259
Speaker 1: No All right, so I guess enough about you.

215
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,486
Speaker 1: Let's do fun stuff.

216
00:13:25,587 --> 00:13:27,860
Speaker 1: So have you heard about this risk legacy game that's coming out?

217
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:29,206
Speaker 1: I want I want to know your opinions.

218
00:13:29,588 --> 00:13:31,780
Speaker 0: I have only heard the vaguest of things about this.

219
00:13:31,901 --> 00:13:33,580
Speaker 1: Okay, so there's a new risk coming out.

220
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,840
Speaker 1: It was designed by Rob Davia and someone else whose name I could get from board game geek if I wanted to.

221
00:13:38,584 --> 00:13:41,365
Speaker 1: Sorry, sorry other guy And basically it's a risk.

222
00:13:41,886 --> 00:13:44,414
Speaker 1: right you roll dice you attack countries.

223
00:13:44,435 --> 00:13:46,120
Speaker 1: the Ukraine is weak the whole thing, right?

224
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,703
Speaker 1: But I think it's.

225
00:13:46,924 --> 00:13:56,460
Speaker 1: I think it's a future sci-fi with different races And the most important thing which is strangely revolutionary is that it's persistent, right?

226
00:13:56,761 --> 00:14:08,346
Speaker 1: So I haven't read the rules completely but what it looks like is When you start the game Like you pick a race and you choose one of two powers and you tear up the card and throw it away And then like well the

227
00:14:08,426 --> 00:14:09,933
Speaker 2: board itself you write you put

228
00:14:09,973 --> 00:14:15,974
Speaker 1: five stickers on the board You write the names of cities on and territories on the board.

229
00:14:15,994 --> 00:14:17,860
Speaker 1: That is crazy, right?

230
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:24,571
Speaker 1: So it but it's like, you know, it's weird in that in video games Persistence is something that's been around since muds.

231
00:14:24,973 --> 00:14:26,600
Speaker 2: It's also something that usually pisses me off.

232
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,995
Speaker 2: They take a stateless game like counter-strike to add persistence.

233
00:14:29,136 --> 00:14:29,579
Speaker 2: I'm mad.

234
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:31,166
Speaker 2: Yeah, we're mad about it too.

235
00:14:31,226 --> 00:14:34,540
Speaker 1: that like ruin the game, but it's something that's always been in RPGs, right?

236
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:41,520
Speaker 1: You level up your character is persistent right to take the persistence and put it into the the regular old board game.

237
00:14:41,741 --> 00:14:43,774
Speaker 1: It's strange that it hasn't been done earlier.

238
00:14:43,794 --> 00:14:44,760
Speaker 0: That's cool.

239
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:48,399
Speaker 2: Like as soon as I heard about it, I was just dumbfounded that I hadn't thought of it.

240
00:14:48,720 --> 00:15:00,695
Speaker 0: Yeah, well cuz I mean my first impulse would be like nobody would pay for that Nobody would play that game, but then you would get collectors who would buy it and then that would be it Which is cool in and of its own right, but that's excuse me.

241
00:15:00,736 --> 00:15:01,640
Speaker 0: That sounds very very cool.

242
00:15:02,103 --> 00:15:06,700
Speaker 1: I definitely think hardcore people would probably buy to Not put the stickers on the board.

243
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,970
Speaker 1: They would just sort of cut the sticker out maybe and sort of put it.

244
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're gonna get all sorts of weird Contortion print out.

245
00:15:12,624 --> 00:15:18,220
Speaker 1: so people just put all the disposable stuff aside and print out their own copies to use to play.

246
00:15:18,361 --> 00:15:21,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah, you know with maybe post-it notes and stuff like that.

247
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:34,020
Speaker 0: But but mo like the whatever mainstream families out there, you know who buy it will play it and probably hate each other afterwards Because you're gonna be tearing up card.

248
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:36,488
Speaker 0: Like can you imagine your Christmas present is that?

249
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,840
Speaker 0: and you either that I get it and you you're taking immediately tearing it up and writing.

250
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:40,402
Speaker 0: I know that.

251
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:45,017
Speaker 2: what if like your dad tears up your card because he's nuked you and now that's on the board forever.

252
00:15:45,037 --> 00:15:46,603
Speaker 0: That's Amazing.

253
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:48,088
Speaker 0: I love that to death.

254
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,156
Speaker 0: But yeah, I can see tears.

255
00:15:50,337 --> 00:15:51,260
Speaker 0: I see tears in the future.

256
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:54,912
Speaker 2: Interestingly the price point is at the upper end of German board game price.

257
00:15:54,972 --> 00:15:56,838
Speaker 2: It's like 60 bucks something like that.

258
00:15:56,878 --> 00:15:57,440
Speaker 1: It's expensive.

259
00:15:57,781 --> 00:15:58,163
Speaker 2: Well, yeah.

260
00:15:58,845 --> 00:15:59,006
Speaker 0: Yeah.

261
00:15:59,026 --> 00:16:02,780
Speaker 0: Well, they must have us some kind of like reusable components in there.

262
00:16:02,925 --> 00:16:10,665
Speaker 1: Yeah Basically from what I understand is you can you play it X number of times like 12 13 times and every time you play it You something changes.

263
00:16:10,705 --> 00:16:13,840
Speaker 1: you're still modifying the game, but we're rich the world in some way, right?

264
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:22,300
Speaker 1: But when you're all done with those 13 playthroughs or however many it is Then you can still play risk on that board with all the modifications that have happened to it.

265
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:24,837
Speaker 1: But you just don't modify it anymore and you're playing.

266
00:16:24,878 --> 00:16:25,180
Speaker 1: sentence.

267
00:16:25,301 --> 00:16:26,560
Speaker 1: Now that set is set in stone.

268
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:35,920
Speaker 2: It might actually be different from another set that is done plan because you're playing in rims world the winner at the very end Names the world Wow and writes it on the board with.

269
00:16:37,964 --> 00:16:48,509
Speaker 2: I'm so jealous Yeah, so like we got to make some games to do this now because it's definitely opened up a whole new world I think I think it's gonna do the same thing that Dominion did.

270
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:51,400
Speaker 2: that Dominion came out and then there's a million Dominion clones.

271
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:53,746
Speaker 2: I was tricked by Thunderstone.

272
00:16:53,806 --> 00:16:55,952
Speaker 2: I was like, oh dungeon crawl Dominion.

273
00:16:55,973 --> 00:16:57,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was the second one, right?

274
00:16:57,738 --> 00:16:58,380
Speaker 1: It's terrible.

275
00:16:58,642 --> 00:16:59,004
Speaker 1: I usually the.

276
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:00,132
Speaker 1: have you seen quarryers.

277
00:17:00,152 --> 00:17:04,368
Speaker 1: It's Nice building game my card.

278
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,635
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a dice building.

279
00:17:05,655 --> 00:17:06,178
Speaker 0: Yes.

280
00:17:06,198 --> 00:17:06,520
Speaker 0: That's right.

281
00:17:06,661 --> 00:17:09,335
Speaker 1: So you say instead of buying cards for your deck you buy dice.

282
00:17:09,355 --> 00:17:10,160
Speaker 1: you put them in a bag.

283
00:17:10,261 --> 00:17:12,400
Speaker 1: You draw five dice out of the bag and you roll them.

284
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,346
Speaker 1: So you need Dominion.

285
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:13,990
Speaker 1: you buy a card.

286
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:17,780
Speaker 1: the card always does what it does But in quarryers you buy a die.

287
00:17:18,143 --> 00:17:18,748
Speaker 1: There's a chance.

288
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:20,020
Speaker 1: it might do one thing as a chance.

289
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:22,353
Speaker 1: It might do another thing because you roll it every time you play it.

290
00:17:22,373 --> 00:17:24,876
Speaker 1: I Think that's the most clever one I've seen.

291
00:17:25,864 --> 00:17:26,647
Speaker 1: But yeah, we got it.

292
00:17:26,688 --> 00:17:36,153
Speaker 1: I'm thinking dungeon crawl like, you know Raven law hero quest hero quest where you put stickers on the board Breaking dies or doesn't die and then that you know, you open the envelope.

293
00:17:36,194 --> 00:17:36,997
Speaker 2: It's like the king died.

294
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:38,984
Speaker 2: Oh shit Like.

295
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,275
Speaker 2: maybe there's one scary envelope.

296
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:40,760
Speaker 2: the whole game.

297
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:43,876
Speaker 2: It's like if Rowan dies, you even know who Rowan is.

298
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,819
Speaker 2: when you start playing The game like you see you find Rowan and then everyone's like him.

299
00:17:48,621 --> 00:17:52,974
Speaker 1: That's the coolest thing at the envelopes with like rules in them that you don't open until the time is right.

300
00:17:53,556 --> 00:17:54,640
Speaker 0: Ah, that's so cool.

301
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:57,471
Speaker 0: Wow, well good job guys.

302
00:17:57,551 --> 00:17:58,740
Speaker 0: I mean, I was really jealous.

303
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:07,067
Speaker 2: I was really surprised like I did not expect that this to happen like this kind of game Especially for risk to be the game that they're doing it with Because risk is like Monopoly.

304
00:18:07,087 --> 00:18:09,800
Speaker 2: It's kind of like this venerable game that everyone played as a kid and hates.

305
00:18:10,521 --> 00:18:11,592
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's the thing.

306
00:18:11,652 --> 00:18:12,400
Speaker 0: It's like a template.

307
00:18:12,581 --> 00:18:19,979
Speaker 0: It's these you know, this kind of raw squishy template like much like D&D that you can Then start banging and hacking around into other stuff.

308
00:18:20,642 --> 00:18:23,630
Speaker 0: I I have I have hacked up risk a little bit.

309
00:18:23,991 --> 00:18:31,052
Speaker 0: when I was developing a Napoleonic version of burning wheel I was looking at Down with that.

310
00:18:31,133 --> 00:18:39,111
Speaker 2: I love that shit But I was trying to make my own mod of it to run a ship game where everyone's on like a British Navy vessel Mmm, like a quarter way through that and I gave up.

311
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:41,299
Speaker 0: I had I have ship combat rules somewhere in there.

312
00:18:43,462 --> 00:18:45,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had like you my ship combat rules are fun, too.

313
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:51,939
Speaker 0: Like you could pretty much grab any object and use it as a ship, right so you could play it on any surface.

314
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:56,100
Speaker 0: Use anything you like, you know, we would have had paper cutouts or something like that.

315
00:18:56,341 --> 00:18:57,063
Speaker 0: But that but we also.

316
00:18:57,083 --> 00:19:00,371
Speaker 0: but the the system of measurement was relative.

317
00:19:00,391 --> 00:19:01,113
Speaker 0: It was lengths.

318
00:19:01,595 --> 00:19:03,600
Speaker 0: So it was lengths of x-ship lengths of a bar.

319
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:11,500
Speaker 0: So so right, so whatever you if you had a pencil as a ship then you move that pencil, you know It moved ten lengths as it moved two pencils forward.

320
00:19:12,842 --> 00:19:15,700
Speaker 1: But if so, if I've got a pencil and you've got a penny then you're in trouble.

321
00:19:15,801 --> 00:19:19,602
Speaker 0: Well that you would move pencil links you whatever like when you set the lengths of not It's not.

322
00:19:19,622 --> 00:19:20,687
Speaker 0: you would move lengths of your ship.

323
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,120
Speaker 1: You would like you could set the length at anything.

324
00:19:23,180 --> 00:19:26,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, then the yeah, you're right because you don't need to all have rulers and warhead.

325
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,344
Speaker 2: I don't bring.

326
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:29,114
Speaker 2: my pencil is longer than your pencils.

327
00:19:29,174 --> 00:19:30,099
Speaker 2: I have a better pencil.

328
00:19:33,871 --> 00:19:36,103
Speaker 0: So What the hell.

329
00:19:36,163 --> 00:19:37,588
Speaker 0: why did I just talk about that?

330
00:19:37,648 --> 00:19:38,651
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

331
00:19:38,691 --> 00:19:39,654
Speaker 2: No, no, I want it.

332
00:19:39,674 --> 00:19:41,220
Speaker 2: I really want it.

333
00:19:41,962 --> 00:19:55,258
Speaker 0: So we I one of the things I was working on those I was I was gonna cannibalize a risk set to be the like warfare mechanic Cuz because one of the versions of risk had cannons horsemen.

334
00:19:55,298 --> 00:19:58,046
Speaker 2: Yep It's right there on the corner.

335
00:19:58,086 --> 00:19:58,508
Speaker 2: I've got it.

336
00:19:58,809 --> 00:20:02,447
Speaker 2: It has that mod with the Ottomans and the cat the bases The castles.

337
00:20:02,507 --> 00:20:05,643
Speaker 1: No, I think the one is the one I had which is slow But that's the one newer that.

338
00:20:05,663 --> 00:20:10,018
Speaker 2: but that set also has the cannons and the horses not just the little try whatever right?

339
00:20:10,601 --> 00:20:14,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, the just they pretty still like around ten years ago.

340
00:20:14,381 --> 00:20:16,280
Speaker 2: So when was the last time you played a game of risk all the way through?

341
00:20:18,882 --> 00:20:26,086
Speaker 2: It ended in victory as opposed to the table being flipped Vericon At a con.

342
00:20:26,207 --> 00:20:30,186
Speaker 0: No, no, it was after Vericon in maybe 2004 okay.

343
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:31,030
Speaker 1: That's actually pretty reason.

344
00:20:31,051 --> 00:20:37,353
Speaker 2: That's about 14 does five and it was When we had our risk tournament at RIT that one time maybe.

345
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:38,718
Speaker 0: yeah, it was one of the.

346
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:51,991
Speaker 0: it was a very Informative night of play And I well, I realized it always I you know, I had This revelations about why I didn't like risk.

347
00:20:52,292 --> 00:20:56,853
Speaker 0: I won't go so far as to say that why risk is fucking broken but why say that?

348
00:20:56,933 --> 00:21:05,974
Speaker 0: because the My friend was winning and he was quite happy about winning, but he wouldn't win Mmm purpose on purpose.

349
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:11,400
Speaker 2: Oh Yeah, so there and there's one thing we couldn't like you're holed up in Australia and he just can't break through.

350
00:21:11,541 --> 00:21:15,374
Speaker 0: Oh, I was holed up in Australia was it was that scenario, but there was no like.

351
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:16,920
Speaker 0: there was nothing I could do.

352
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:17,924
Speaker 0: There was no like.

353
00:21:18,507 --> 00:21:19,532
Speaker 0: I didn't have any cards.

354
00:21:19,572 --> 00:21:21,703
Speaker 0: I only had this many troops on the table Like I couldn't.

355
00:21:22,286 --> 00:21:24,037
Speaker 0: you know, I you know the.

356
00:21:24,077 --> 00:21:31,019
Speaker 0: for my turn I would have to like attack him and like, you know Do one round of combat and then stop or whatever like because it was nothing to be done.

357
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:34,017
Speaker 0: But he wouldn't he would just he would do the same thing.

358
00:21:34,078 --> 00:21:42,910
Speaker 0: He wouldn't Actually win he would just play around and then just like basically he was just dumping units on the board To try to get up to whatever the maximum unit level is.

359
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:46,213
Speaker 0: and you know, even though I had four territories There's nothing I could do.

360
00:21:47,582 --> 00:21:50,580
Speaker 0: And it was very very informative like wow, there's something going on here.

361
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:56,020
Speaker 0: There's something wrong the fact that this is a game about world conquest and and it has to come to this inevitable conclusion.

362
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:59,372
Speaker 0: But there's nothing here driving play toward that conclusion.

363
00:21:59,673 --> 00:22:03,966
Speaker 0: It's you know, it could continue like this indefinitely And that is problematic.

364
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:07,456
Speaker 2: Yeah, I mean look in his case his utility was get stuff on the board.

365
00:22:07,536 --> 00:22:08,218
Speaker 2: piss off Luke.

366
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:18,640
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah, yeah, absolutely, right, which is interesting from a kind of sociological anthropological standpoint Not so interesting from a gameplay standpoint.

367
00:22:19,722 --> 00:22:22,639
Speaker 1: So so what games have you played recently like, you know?

368
00:22:24,001 --> 00:22:25,100
Speaker 1: Have you played a game recently?

369
00:22:25,956 --> 00:22:31,755
Speaker 0: Oh Lord what well my my funny that you mentioned Napoleonic.

370
00:22:31,775 --> 00:22:32,478
Speaker 0: so my love.

371
00:22:32,538 --> 00:22:37,944
Speaker 0: this year This past year has been the commanding colors Napoleonic Which.

372
00:22:38,105 --> 00:22:39,414
Speaker 0: so that's the guys who made memoir.

373
00:22:39,434 --> 00:22:42,887
Speaker 1: Yeah It's free on Steam now, you can just play it.

374
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:44,152
Speaker 2: remember out 44 online.

375
00:22:44,292 --> 00:22:44,854
Speaker 0: Oh, that's cool.

376
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:51,787
Speaker 0: So So that was That I've had that.

377
00:22:51,807 --> 00:22:53,839
Speaker 0: I haven't played it nearly enough but I really enjoy that.

378
00:22:54,502 --> 00:22:56,048
Speaker 2: Don't be tricked into getting battle lore.

379
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:02,189
Speaker 0: No, I I played battle or a couple times and I just couldn't deal My battle or said yeah, you can have it.

380
00:23:02,209 --> 00:23:05,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really I played it like once that all my friends I know they played it like once.

381
00:23:05,447 --> 00:23:05,952
Speaker 0: they don't like it.

382
00:23:06,698 --> 00:23:12,945
Speaker 0: So So Napoleonic I've also been playing.

383
00:23:12,985 --> 00:23:13,608
Speaker 0: some of you.

384
00:23:13,909 --> 00:23:21,917
Speaker 0: your listeners might have heard me interview about With with genocides Jen about Greg Stafford's Pendragon.

385
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:27,946
Speaker 2: Yeah We're gonna play that I think after Scott Spends a year or two training.

386
00:23:28,087 --> 00:23:31,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was like how much like how much Arthurian stuff?

387
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:35,820
Speaker 1: Do I need to know because I started reading it and it was like, you know It's like I don't know anything about heraldry.

388
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:41,400
Speaker 1: So how much like heraldry do I have to learn in real world in order to do you have the just the rulebook?

389
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:41,802
Speaker 0: Pendragon.

390
00:23:41,822 --> 00:23:44,180
Speaker 1: I have to get the other one though like the campaign one, right?

391
00:23:45,102 --> 00:23:46,528
Speaker 0: The campaign will walk you through everything.

392
00:23:46,548 --> 00:23:49,840
Speaker 1: Well, I don't have to go and read like more to Arthur to learn.

393
00:23:50,041 --> 00:23:57,085
Speaker 0: You should because it's cool anyway, but the point no, no the great Pendragon campaign has everything is exhaustive So me but it's like.

394
00:23:57,567 --> 00:24:00,100
Speaker 1: so if I'm gonna run this do I have to read that entire?

395
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:06,810
Speaker 1: Campaign or can I just turn to page one and sort of begin the campaign that you totally it's on rails, dude You don't need to read ahead.

396
00:24:06,831 --> 00:24:07,639
Speaker 1: You don't need to read ahead.

397
00:24:08,042 --> 00:24:11,160
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like you can read ahead for like the next week or whatever, but it's totally on rails.

398
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:14,900
Speaker 1: So it's pretty much just read the rule book then open up the big book and start playing.

399
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:19,800
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean obviously I read like the first, you know bunch of pages in the big one to know what it's coming up.

400
00:24:20,421 --> 00:24:21,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, otherwise the camp.

401
00:24:21,226 --> 00:24:23,720
Speaker 1: it would be a little weird if we're sitting there playing again, but I'm reading a whole page.

402
00:24:23,781 --> 00:24:24,348
Speaker 1: Let people wait.

403
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:24,672
Speaker 0: Yeah.

404
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:25,179
Speaker 0: No, don't do that.

405
00:24:26,705 --> 00:24:30,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, you really want to familiarize yourself with the the basic mechanics.

406
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:31,494
Speaker 0: They're gonna be a little bit different than what you're used to.

407
00:24:31,515 --> 00:24:41,440
Speaker 0: No kidding Like how you get bonuses how you apply like and apply them How you make contested tests like how you make an uncontested test like it's just a little bit different.

408
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,146
Speaker 0: I have you played hero quest whatever.

409
00:24:43,367 --> 00:24:43,788
Speaker 0: Yeah.

410
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:45,173
Speaker 0: Okay, so so then you're.

411
00:24:45,234 --> 00:24:45,836
Speaker 0: then you're good.

412
00:24:46,077 --> 00:24:49,819
Speaker 0: You're good for that the I was gonna say passions.

413
00:24:50,601 --> 00:24:59,835
Speaker 0: You're gonna want to learn how to how passions work and how traits work and and you're you're going to have to pick out like you're gonna figure out kind of what the authority level of the GM is in the game.

414
00:24:59,875 --> 00:25:03,435
Speaker 0: like when you can make someone make a passion test one you can make them make a trait test, you know.

415
00:25:03,475 --> 00:25:09,161
Speaker 0: when you can just you know fuck with them in other ways because there's The.

416
00:25:09,241 --> 00:25:14,023
Speaker 0: the GM has some kind of really hard sticks that he can hit the players with In addition.

417
00:25:14,164 --> 00:25:18,799
Speaker 1: so if you hit too often then well, no you hard no you need to hit.

418
00:25:19,402 --> 00:25:21,272
Speaker 0: You need to every time the players cross that line.

419
00:25:21,292 --> 00:25:22,840
Speaker 0: You need to hit them with the stick in the game.

420
00:25:23,123 --> 00:25:24,035
Speaker 0: Otherwise the game breaks down.

421
00:25:24,781 --> 00:25:29,736
Speaker 0: Otherwise if it's like parenting it's like if you're inconsistent like oh you did that once but it was fine then.

422
00:25:29,776 --> 00:25:33,320
Speaker 0: but now no BAM It'll drive those people crazy.

423
00:25:33,364 --> 00:25:39,452
Speaker 1: Yeah That's actually harder though because it's like You know something that I always have a problem with a running burning wheel and other things like.

424
00:25:39,472 --> 00:25:45,360
Speaker 1: I forget to do the steel test You know, you just don't remember right, you know, or you forget to do a dwarven greed test.

425
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,510
Speaker 1: So forgetting to hit with the stick, you know, if that's very important there.

426
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:55,968
Speaker 0: It's yeah, but it's uh, the game's a lot more Confined to these things than it is.

427
00:25:56,350 --> 00:26:00,511
Speaker 0: then burning wheel is it's not a quite as a man So, you know for people have no idea where it's at.

428
00:26:00,552 --> 00:26:01,760
Speaker 1: Well, like what is what is the game like?

429
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,192
Speaker 1: It's obviously a king Arthur Arthurian legend.

430
00:26:04,253 --> 00:26:07,668
Speaker 2: It was described to me by Scott as I was giving it somehow just as awesome.

431
00:26:11,041 --> 00:26:16,900
Speaker 1: It's like I gave him like a second hand description based on a half reading of the rules and listening to you on another podcast.

432
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:18,826
Speaker 2: So he's like, you don't make any decisions.

433
00:26:18,866 --> 00:26:19,729
Speaker 2: You have no control.

434
00:26:19,749 --> 00:26:22,196
Speaker 2: I just tell you what happens and it sounds awesome.

435
00:26:22,397 --> 00:26:22,718
Speaker 0: Yeah.

436
00:26:22,818 --> 00:26:23,360
Speaker 0: Yeah pretty much.

437
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,355
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

438
00:26:28,962 --> 00:26:30,971
Speaker 0: It's a really amazing game design.

439
00:26:31,092 --> 00:26:35,078
Speaker 0: It's it's unique For a role-playing game.

440
00:26:36,003 --> 00:26:52,840
Speaker 0: One of if I'm not mistaken one of Greg Stafford's priorities when designing it was to take Control away from the players and put it and so make to make the character a little less Controllable so that the players couldn't simply walk up to can't walk up to Uther and just knife him, right?

441
00:26:53,060 --> 00:27:03,307
Speaker 0: You can't be like I'll take Arthur ha ha ha You can't do any of that stuff because your your character has these these traits and passions and all these kind of Rules that it that the character must abide by.

442
00:27:03,689 --> 00:27:06,859
Speaker 0: and the thing is they're not just simply strictures laid down of.

443
00:27:06,879 --> 00:27:08,049
Speaker 0: no You can't do that.

444
00:27:08,634 --> 00:27:11,250
Speaker 0: It's All built into the fiction of the game.

445
00:27:11,331 --> 00:27:12,558
Speaker 0: to like it all makes sense.

446
00:27:12,578 --> 00:27:19,560
Speaker 0: your character Basically, if you push him too far in one direction, he'll start to act like a knight in that period.

447
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:27,940
Speaker 0: he'll start to behave like In that manner and and you basically you the player will be confronted with okay, you have to behave in that manner.

448
00:27:28,103 --> 00:27:29,018
Speaker 0: What do you do now?

449
00:27:29,322 --> 00:27:30,919
Speaker 0: It doesn't say exactly what you have to do.

450
00:27:31,341 --> 00:27:34,693
Speaker 0: It doesn't say like you must do X but it says okay, you hate Saxons.

451
00:27:34,914 --> 00:27:36,480
Speaker 0: the Saxons are asking you for emissary.

452
00:27:37,801 --> 00:27:38,384
Speaker 0: What do you do?

453
00:27:38,565 --> 00:27:39,349
Speaker 0: You have to hate them.

454
00:27:39,509 --> 00:27:41,560
Speaker 0: You have to figure out some way to manifest that hatred here.

455
00:27:42,721 --> 00:27:43,507
Speaker 0: And so it's.

456
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:44,171
Speaker 0: it's hard.

457
00:27:44,211 --> 00:27:54,297
Speaker 0: It's really challenging on the players But it's amazing how it Produces, you know, it does what it says it's supposed to do.

458
00:27:55,381 --> 00:27:55,984
Speaker 0: It's really neat.

459
00:27:56,266 --> 00:27:59,822
Speaker 2: So by the end you've basically played out the entire Arthurian legend Mm-hmm.

460
00:28:00,063 --> 00:28:01,667
Speaker 1: So how long have you been playing this?

461
00:28:02,108 --> 00:28:03,652
Speaker 0: We played about 14 sessions.

462
00:28:03,672 --> 00:28:08,592
Speaker 0: We're on hiatus right now because we pretty much Knifed each other.

463
00:28:08,613 --> 00:28:12,232
Speaker 1: Okay How far along through the big book did you get?

464
00:28:12,252 --> 00:28:13,920
Speaker 1: and we're in the session where the anarchy?

465
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,070
Speaker 0: Period where I think at four nine nine nine or five hundred.

466
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,920
Speaker 1: Well, how many pages like how you know percentage wise?

467
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:20,587
Speaker 0: Oh, I don't know.

468
00:28:20,689 --> 00:28:21,178
Speaker 0: I'm not the GM.

469
00:28:24,584 --> 00:28:26,519
Speaker 1: How many sessions would it take to get to the end?

470
00:28:27,291 --> 00:28:29,487
Speaker 1: You know It goes off to the end.

471
00:28:29,527 --> 00:28:30,149
Speaker 1: It's over.

472
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,900
Speaker 0: It's like two or two and a half years of play or something.

473
00:28:33,161 --> 00:28:35,936
Speaker 1: Okay playing every month every week every every week.

474
00:28:35,996 --> 00:28:36,137
Speaker 1: Yeah.

475
00:28:36,278 --> 00:28:36,499
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

476
00:28:39,182 --> 00:28:44,358
Speaker 2: So in other words like eight to ten years Our burning wheel game is lucky if it's every other week.

477
00:28:45,362 --> 00:28:49,512
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, it's a. it's a really amazing piece of work.

478
00:28:49,592 --> 00:28:52,378
Speaker 0: how he's taken the mythology and made this game out of it.

479
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:56,317
Speaker 0: and The one of the frustrating things for us is that you weren't.

480
00:28:56,377 --> 00:28:59,984
Speaker 0: you're not important in the mythology In any.

481
00:29:00,004 --> 00:29:02,010
Speaker 1: you're not playing as Arthur Lancelot right there.

482
00:29:02,050 --> 00:29:03,394
Speaker 0: No can you cannot.

483
00:29:03,634 --> 00:29:05,540
Speaker 1: yeah, you have to be sir dicks a lot or whatever.

484
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,173
Speaker 0: Yep, I am sir gee.

485
00:29:08,193 --> 00:29:13,039
Speaker 0: I Can't remember my last my manner like a French.

00:29:14,787 --> 00:29:18,929
Speaker 0: Whatever Sir guy I'm sir gee of sir gee.

487
00:29:18,949 --> 00:29:21,117
Speaker 0: the cruel is my character.

488
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:21,980
Speaker 0: Are you actually cruel?

489
00:29:22,221 --> 00:29:24,669
Speaker 0: I am the cruelest man in all of Britain.

490
00:29:24,849 --> 00:29:26,715
Speaker 1: So why are you allowed to be a knight if you're so mean?

491
00:29:27,176 --> 00:29:32,710
Speaker 0: cruelty is not Cruelty and mercy that their opposites are not important.

492
00:29:33,192 --> 00:29:34,737
Speaker 1: See your peasants are just pissed.

493
00:29:35,098 --> 00:29:35,500
Speaker 1: They hate you.

494
00:29:35,781 --> 00:29:37,750
Speaker 0: No, I'm actually really loyal to my pens.

495
00:29:37,770 --> 00:29:39,679
Speaker 0: I'm actually the most loyal man in all of Britain as well.

496
00:29:40,121 --> 00:29:47,740
Speaker 1: Oh, so I'm cruel to the people who try to fuck with your oh my god Like if say if I come and they know I'm trying to like I will take you into my basement and torture you.

497
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,092
Speaker 0: This is this is how I did.

498
00:29:50,112 --> 00:29:51,500
Speaker 2: He start out that cruel.

499
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:53,440
Speaker 0: He started out a little less cruel.

500
00:29:53,904 --> 00:29:55,440
Speaker 0: I decided my last character died.

501
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:01,736
Speaker 0: I played kind of a a knight who was more interested in intrigue in court and stuff like that and I got a lance through my chest.

502
00:30:03,041 --> 00:30:11,920
Speaker 0: So in a joust or just or in court ending in a joust Okay with another night, which I got at court and I have the same lance skill as him.

503
00:30:12,283 --> 00:30:13,758
Speaker 0: So yeah prepare to die a lot.

504
00:30:15,541 --> 00:30:26,620
Speaker 0: So I decided to play a man more of the age and since the age is about fighting and killing shit I made a guy who was a little bit better at being At fighting killing shit and I just wanted to play against hype for this.

505
00:30:27,223 --> 00:30:29,151
Speaker 0: I'm actually hurting myself by playing a cruel night.

506
00:30:29,633 --> 00:30:30,919
Speaker 0: You can because you can be.

507
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:37,672
Speaker 0: You can be Like a virtuous night and you can be religious right?

508
00:30:37,692 --> 00:30:40,000
Speaker 1: So the cruel night is not gonna get the Holy Grail, right?

509
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:40,947
Speaker 1: It's just not gonna happen.

510
00:30:41,431 --> 00:30:44,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think so the but so I'm.

511
00:30:44,766 --> 00:30:52,373
Speaker 0: I lose out on a hundred glory a year, which is a big deal because Yeah, which is a really big deal because I've amped my cruelty up so high

512
00:30:53,056 --> 00:30:56,956
Speaker 1: that seems to be from reading the rules Like the number one thing is just get as much glory

513
00:30:56,997 --> 00:30:57,500
Speaker 0: as possible.

514
00:30:59,463 --> 00:31:12,552
Speaker 0: The game is weird and its priorities like it's actual gameplay priorities like the kind of the behavior that it rewards because there's all these great ways that it sculpts your behavior and makes you behave like a You know like a knight in this age and the Knights in this age are complicated creatures.

515
00:31:12,592 --> 00:31:17,365
Speaker 0: They're violent, you know angry But you know religious.

516
00:31:17,466 --> 00:31:20,475
Speaker 0: but also they're loyal and honorable and tolerant.

517
00:31:20,555 --> 00:31:25,537
Speaker 0: and you know, it's weird It's cool, you know, so that the characters have a lot of nuance to them.

518
00:31:26,685 --> 00:31:33,564
Speaker 0: but You in order to survive the the rigors of the age the perils of the age You have to acquire glory.

519
00:31:33,584 --> 00:31:36,113
Speaker 0: and in order to acquire glory, you need to be hungrier.

520
00:31:36,313 --> 00:31:38,240
Speaker 0: hungrier than a fucking fifth-level magic user.

521
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:49,940
Speaker 0: So Yeah, you really need to be gunning for those points all the time and you need to be like pushing aside your fellow players.

522
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:53,384
Speaker 0: I mean like no No I will speak to with her and you know I will lead the charge.

523
00:31:53,425 --> 00:31:57,119
Speaker 0: and like every time you need to be like climbing over each other for glory.

524
00:31:58,180 --> 00:32:01,679
Speaker 1: hmm Ready to fight for glory instead of what you believe?

525
00:32:03,552 --> 00:32:04,924
Speaker 2: Well Give it a year.

526
00:32:04,944 --> 00:32:05,786
Speaker 2: Do you studying?

527
00:32:06,067 --> 00:32:11,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll start off maybe by the time I'm 50 maybe actually, you know That's another thing is I look forward to.

528
00:32:11,885 --> 00:32:16,580
Speaker 1: you know, we haven't yet had like the group of like retired nerds.

529
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:21,255
Speaker 1: All right If you're retired and you're a nerd you can write that two and a half years.

530
00:32:21,696 --> 00:32:26,767
Speaker 1: suddenly you're not playing every week You're playing every day Maybe every day for three hours.

531
00:32:26,927 --> 00:32:30,720
Speaker 0: You're I think I would not be friends with my friends if I play that game.

532
00:32:33,600 --> 00:32:35,670
Speaker 1: But Yeah, you can get it done in a few months.

533
00:32:35,711 --> 00:32:39,471
Speaker 1: that way right sure All right.

534
00:32:39,895 --> 00:32:40,983
Speaker 1: All right Anything else?

535
00:32:41,023 --> 00:32:42,591
Speaker 1: Is there anything else you want to talk about anything fun?

536
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:43,556
Speaker 1: You've been doing lately?

537
00:32:43,637 --> 00:32:55,168
Speaker 0: So I well, so just related to that I Apparently I'm going to be on the genocides again With Greg Stafford the author of Pendragon.

538
00:32:55,189 --> 00:32:57,195
Speaker 1: All right, I definitely tweet that out so I can.

539
00:32:57,215 --> 00:32:58,378
Speaker 0: so I can get I will.

540
00:32:58,699 --> 00:32:59,979
Speaker 0: I will I'll put it on the Twitter.

541
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:04,423
Speaker 0: But yes, that will be after the 11 11 11 con.

542
00:33:04,443 --> 00:33:14,846
Speaker 1: so also I guess to be Tangential the new burning wheel is out To you.

543
00:33:14,866 --> 00:33:17,380
Speaker 2: since then we have not even talked about burning wheel gold.

544
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,545
Speaker 2: We have not actually played it.

545
00:33:18,585 --> 00:33:20,613
Speaker 2: Our game is still burning wheel revised.

546
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:21,838
Speaker 2: We haven't done one version.

547
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:24,493
Speaker 0: Oh cool Yeah, I think you guys will like it.

548
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:31,340
Speaker 0: Everyone says that It's smoother more, you know more streamlined easier to reference and whatnot.

549
00:33:31,681 --> 00:33:32,102
Speaker 2: So what's that?

550
00:33:32,122 --> 00:33:33,809
Speaker 2: What's the guiding philosophy of burning wheel gold?

551
00:33:33,829 --> 00:33:36,799
Speaker 2: Like what was the like your main intent in?

552
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,346
Speaker 2: Creating it as opposed to revise.

553
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:41,133
Speaker 2: Do you have a mission statement?

554
00:33:41,173 --> 00:33:42,077
Speaker 2: or was it just let's fix this.

555
00:33:42,117 --> 00:33:42,659
Speaker 2: Let's fix this.

556
00:33:43,763 --> 00:33:44,770
Speaker 0: It was ARG.

557
00:33:45,051 --> 00:33:45,978
Speaker 0: shut the fuck up.

558
00:33:46,744 --> 00:33:48,034
Speaker 0: Stop arguing about that.

559
00:33:50,060 --> 00:33:52,148
Speaker 1: So what were people arguing about?

560
00:33:52,168 --> 00:33:55,400
Speaker 0: at least the major thing one of the things that drove me nuts.

561
00:33:56,641 --> 00:34:04,725
Speaker 0: Burning wheel gold's been in the works for years, but you know just to what extent it was gonna come in at and Was up in the air.

562
00:34:05,187 --> 00:34:08,280
Speaker 0: It's one of the things that that one of the the defining moments was.

563
00:34:09,885 --> 00:34:24,739
Speaker 0: on the forums there was like a 20 page debate about positioning and You know, I like ranging cover positioning or fight positioning both Fight positioning and I. I like those rules and they you know, they're they're fun.

564
00:34:25,364 --> 00:34:26,471
Speaker 0: But I was like, I'm reading the stuff.

565
00:34:26,491 --> 00:34:27,760
Speaker 0: I'm like, this isn't what my game is about.

566
00:34:28,302 --> 00:34:29,145
Speaker 0: My game does not.

567
00:34:29,386 --> 00:34:32,717
Speaker 0: I just don't care and no one should care this much about the.

568
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:37,960
Speaker 0: you know If you have a spear and you're at lunging and you you know, how do you withdraw?

569
00:34:39,204 --> 00:34:41,300
Speaker 2: I feel like sometimes I cared and sometimes I didn't.

570
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:46,717
Speaker 2: Okay, well it depended on what kind of game it was and what was going on in the game at the time.

571
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:47,080
Speaker 2: sure.

572
00:34:47,321 --> 00:34:49,129
Speaker 0: Well, I mean burning wheels flexible like that too.

573
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:49,591
Speaker 0: Like you don't.

574
00:34:49,993 --> 00:34:51,962
Speaker 0: sometimes you just don't have to care about the fight rules That's fine.

575
00:34:52,364 --> 00:34:55,940
Speaker 0: But there just was way too much energy being expended on that shit.

576
00:34:57,107 --> 00:35:01,800
Speaker 0: so You know, I was like, alright, I know I can just tweak this.

577
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:09,460
Speaker 0: Of course now all of those same people are like but but but but so don't play the old game still exists.

578
00:35:09,761 --> 00:35:15,345
Speaker 0: No, it's not that they love the new rules, but they're just they have to question every Iota of the new rules.

579
00:35:15,385 --> 00:35:16,810
Speaker 0: and I'm just like, oh god.

580
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:27,840
Speaker 0: So So I just wanted to to clean things up but also was economical was Putting everyone's like, oh god, it's so cheap.

581
00:35:28,221 --> 00:35:33,360
Speaker 0: Oh, well, actually the two books with the bellyband way more expensive than doing one a single hardcover.

582
00:35:35,061 --> 00:35:40,375
Speaker 1: So I So rather than print more of the you know, the old ones print a new one.

583
00:35:40,576 --> 00:35:41,720
Speaker 1: save money, right?

584
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,868
Speaker 0: You know, yeah, and so right we were.

585
00:35:43,928 --> 00:35:46,460
Speaker 1: if you're gonna print a new one might as well update it.

586
00:35:46,540 --> 00:35:47,202
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

587
00:35:47,764 --> 00:35:51,818
Speaker 0: and yeah, right it was just was the you know, good timing that things are going out of print.

588
00:35:51,859 --> 00:35:54,804
Speaker 0: we had time Yeah, and there were some stuff.

589
00:35:54,824 --> 00:35:55,406
Speaker 0: I wanted to fix it.

590
00:35:55,526 --> 00:35:55,627
Speaker 0: Yeah.

591
00:35:55,667 --> 00:36:03,105
Speaker 0: I was also just sick of sorcerers whining Incessant whining from everyone around source.

592
00:36:03,446 --> 00:36:06,455
Speaker 0: So I mean I just I just there was whining.

593
00:36:06,536 --> 00:36:07,960
Speaker 1: even after the magic burner came out.

594
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:08,704
Speaker 1: They're still whining.

595
00:36:08,865 --> 00:36:09,287
Speaker 0: Oh god.

596
00:36:09,629 --> 00:36:10,253
Speaker 0: I hate magic.

597
00:36:10,273 --> 00:36:12,143
Speaker 0: I Hate.

598
00:36:13,127 --> 00:36:15,196
Speaker 1: I know you didn't like magic because it wasn't in there to begin with.

599
00:36:15,257 --> 00:36:23,645
Speaker 0: I mean not really anyway, so I took some dice away from sorcerers and it's just It's better overall.

600
00:36:24,087 --> 00:36:32,137
Speaker 0: They I just brought them kind of in line with the advancement system and brought them you know in line with just the skill check system and like everything.

601
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:35,706
Speaker 0: so they They aren't quite as special anymore.

602
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:38,033
Speaker 0: They can still whatever pew boom.

603
00:36:38,073 --> 00:36:40,380
Speaker 2: You're dead, but it's all about shards.

604
00:36:40,521 --> 00:36:47,860
Speaker 0: it's charts is a good one, but there's a. There's fewer dice in play and you know, so the range is is tighter.

605
00:36:48,525 --> 00:36:52,225
Speaker 0: The statistical range is tighter, which is nice Less madness.

606
00:36:52,587 --> 00:36:58,394
Speaker 2: So I found to be the insane killing machine That's unstoppable have to be like the gray shade elf now and not the human sorcerer.

607
00:36:58,415 --> 00:37:05,600
Speaker 0: I mean Starting off, you know, if you want to be a human sorcerer like burning wheels kind of like agnostic to this like whatever.

608
00:37:05,662 --> 00:37:14,860
Speaker 0: Do whatever you want you know if you want to be a burning wheel sorcerer with your B6 sorcery and a bunch of forks and your white fire and your turn aside the blade whatever and that's it.

609
00:37:14,961 --> 00:37:15,999
Speaker 0: You're just naked running around me.

610
00:37:18,942 --> 00:37:21,640
Speaker 0: If that's your kind of game like I want you to play it I want you to have fun with it.

611
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:29,787
Speaker 0: But you know, I'm you're not playing that in my game But I ultimately The elf will always be more powerful.

612
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:37,149
Speaker 0: Like if you're gonna if you like you want to go toe-to-toe all the way out to the top Maybe it maybe a dwarf would be the most dark elf.

613
00:37:37,169 --> 00:37:45,720
Speaker 2: definitely That seems to be something people always like like when we show people burning wheel to replay it.

614
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:52,155
Speaker 2: They like the fact that it's not balanced because I think they've gotten the point with Dungeons & Dragons where it's too balanced right door.

615
00:37:52,175 --> 00:37:57,290
Speaker 2: no matter what you are, you're all Exactly equally powerful in all generic situations.

616
00:37:57,511 --> 00:37:57,751
Speaker 0: Yeah.

617
00:37:58,172 --> 00:37:58,533
Speaker 0: Yeah.

618
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:00,318
Speaker 0: I was just never into that.

619
00:38:00,338 --> 00:38:02,598
Speaker 0: I like it's not.

620
00:38:03,721 --> 00:38:07,440
Speaker 0: It's not really necessary from a role-playing game standpoint because role-playing games aren't competitive.

621
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:08,384
Speaker 0: It's not.

622
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:25,085
Speaker 0: it's not really necessary from a narrative standpoint because in a narrative Characters have different statures, but you know also in a narrative all characters have the same weight, but whatever the the but but characters Like it's in a narrative seemingly have all these different You know power levels whatever.

623
00:38:25,547 --> 00:38:29,220
Speaker 0: so I just you know, I took took that shit out from the very beginning.

624
00:38:29,220 --> 00:38:31,400
Speaker 0: I was like, I don't care just make what you want to make, you know.

625
00:38:31,581 --> 00:38:32,086
Speaker 0: but that's the thing.

626
00:38:32,126 --> 00:38:43,174
Speaker 0: you once you do that once you It's cool like you take the brakes off you like or that kind of like the Kind of like moral limits like.

627
00:38:43,214 --> 00:38:44,240
Speaker 0: no, you must be balanced.

628
00:38:44,361 --> 00:38:51,460
Speaker 0: No, you know you must this and you say okay guys No, you guys can choose and you have to figure it out amongst yourselves and kind of make each other happy.

629
00:38:52,001 --> 00:38:53,305
Speaker 0: It just it's great.

630
00:38:53,325 --> 00:39:01,187
Speaker 0: It just adds a lot to the game where you know, you have to you can't just sit there being like And there's tweaking up a character.

631
00:39:01,207 --> 00:39:06,860
Speaker 0: you you have to actually talk to your friends and be like, hey I think I would like to play a stupid munchkin.

632
00:39:09,281 --> 00:39:09,723
Speaker 0: Your friends go.

633
00:39:09,763 --> 00:39:11,450
Speaker 0: no, you always play that.

634
00:39:11,470 --> 00:39:12,333
Speaker 0: we let you play that lesson.

635
00:39:12,353 --> 00:39:24,060
Speaker 2: Well, I'm not gonna play anymore great That's what I was enjoyed reading there at least reading the revised burning wheels our little notes and for some of the really powerful Stuff and said things like this is only okay if everyone at the table agrees to it, right?

636
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,145
Speaker 2: But you didn't exclude it.

637
00:39:25,186 --> 00:39:26,452
Speaker 2: You didn't say no you can't do this.

638
00:39:26,492 --> 00:39:27,859
Speaker 2: You said everyone's got to be cool with it.

639
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,948
Speaker 2: Yeah, it's just like the spirit of role-playing.

640
00:39:30,069 --> 00:39:30,310
Speaker 2: Right?

641
00:39:30,571 --> 00:39:30,832
Speaker 0: Right.

642
00:39:30,852 --> 00:39:45,985
Speaker 0: All right, ultimately what like Vincent says it's role-playing sir, uh role-playing games are games of permissions and expectations and so the permission comes not from Religion or on high it's from you know, everybody at the table.

643
00:39:46,266 --> 00:39:46,446
Speaker 2: Sorry.

644
00:39:46,466 --> 00:39:46,706
Speaker 2: I laughed.

645
00:39:46,726 --> 00:39:49,250
Speaker 2: I was realizing that BDSM is the exact same.

646
00:39:51,844 --> 00:40:08,978
Speaker 1: They do a lot of role-playing permissions and expectations cachao, so So Yes in my you know I don't know if you know this but I get a box of comics in the mail every month from DCB service.

647
00:40:09,179 --> 00:40:10,383
Speaker 1: calm It's actually pretty cool.

648
00:40:10,403 --> 00:40:14,414
Speaker 1: You pre-order two months in advance and everything is like a ludicrous discount.

649
00:40:14,434 --> 00:40:21,230
Speaker 1: So the box was unusually large Last month because there was a very large box within the box.

650
00:40:22,133 --> 00:40:24,630
Speaker 1: Would you would you know about this other box mouse card?

651
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:31,570
Speaker 1: Yeah Maybe that one had a bunch of had a bunch of dice in it and like statues and yeah kinds of crazy crap.

652
00:40:31,691 --> 00:40:37,739
Speaker 1: I mean you guys and the map which was the most cuz I've heard the original hardcover Like you'd be opening the back of the book to use the map.

653
00:40:37,779 --> 00:40:39,124
Speaker 1: That was like in right?

654
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:39,847
Speaker 1: Yeah.

655
00:40:40,269 --> 00:40:43,883
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah mapping ponds and dice and cards and all the cards.

656
00:40:43,923 --> 00:40:44,847
Speaker 1: I forgot about the cards.

657
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:47,163
Speaker 0: Yeah yeah, that was.

658
00:40:47,546 --> 00:40:58,306
Speaker 0: uh That was a long time coming that that the mouse card box set was debuted at Gen Con and Which is in August and it was we sold.

659
00:40:58,347 --> 00:41:03,088
Speaker 0: very very well Nice, and I'm hoping that someday I will see some money from it.

660
00:41:04,278 --> 00:41:05,920
Speaker 0: But I'm very happy with it overall.

661
00:41:07,511 --> 00:41:11,641
Speaker 0: There are of course always things I would tweak but it's very exciting.

662
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:12,704
Speaker 0: It's very popular.

663
00:41:12,744 --> 00:41:13,606
Speaker 0: people seem to enjoy it.

664
00:41:13,626 --> 00:41:17,730
Speaker 1: I Didn't really look too closely at it, but it's it's the exact same game.

665
00:41:17,851 --> 00:41:20,103
Speaker 1: I just has a whole bunch of extra fancy stuff in the or.

666
00:41:20,143 --> 00:41:21,370
Speaker 1: were there any edits to it?

667
00:41:21,691 --> 00:41:22,072
Speaker 0: There's some.

668
00:41:22,393 --> 00:41:24,739
Speaker 0: well we corrected some errata in it.

669
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:25,581
Speaker 1: Okay, that's good.

670
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:37,802
Speaker 0: I probably introduced some as well as I tend to do but we corrected some errata in the rulebook and And the superficial changes are the addition of the cards and the dice.

671
00:41:38,022 --> 00:41:40,150
Speaker 0: and so the dice are custom dice.

672
00:41:41,411 --> 00:41:46,390
Speaker 0: So you have three symbols you have snakes swords and axes on the dice rather than one to six numbers.

673
00:41:46,530 --> 00:41:52,190
Speaker 0: And then so the character sheets reference the custom dice and the GM screen references the custom dice rather than traditional dice.

674
00:41:52,636 --> 00:41:53,650
Speaker 0: So it's superficial stuff.

675
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,206
Speaker 0: I mean you can still use regular dice with it.

676
00:41:55,690 --> 00:41:58,179
Speaker 1: But remember a six is an axe a four and a five is a.

677
00:41:58,239 --> 00:41:59,704
Speaker 2: so that could actually help.

678
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:02,213
Speaker 2: because I it's weird running Role-playing games.

679
00:42:02,253 --> 00:42:03,196
Speaker 2: I'm sure you've seen this before.

680
00:42:03,297 --> 00:42:07,190
Speaker 2: people who have never played a role-playing game ever before versus people who know anything about them.

681
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:13,924
Speaker 2: It's like night and day like the things you think people would assume or be obvious Just don't make any sense to the other people across the board.

682
00:42:13,944 --> 00:42:15,230
Speaker 2: They won't like even burning wheel.

683
00:42:15,290 --> 00:42:21,190
Speaker 2: I see people who don't just can't understand that a four or five or six is a success like they can't like.

684
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:22,874
Speaker 2: Right deal with it.

685
00:42:23,296 --> 00:42:24,681
Speaker 2: Right like but it's a five.

686
00:42:24,902 --> 00:42:25,505
Speaker 2: I got all fives.

687
00:42:25,565 --> 00:42:26,730
Speaker 2: Isn't that better than fours?

688
00:42:26,930 --> 00:42:27,855
Speaker 2: Like they don't right.

689
00:42:28,136 --> 00:42:30,025
Speaker 2: I can't get convince them that it doesn't matter.

690
00:42:30,226 --> 00:42:31,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, so right.

691
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:32,194
Speaker 0: So now you those would be swords.

692
00:42:32,235 --> 00:42:33,941
Speaker 0: you have all swords awesome rockin.

693
00:42:34,162 --> 00:42:35,387
Speaker 0: and now you have all axes.

694
00:42:35,447 --> 00:42:35,969
Speaker 0: that is better.

695
00:42:36,697 --> 00:42:37,388
Speaker 0: Alright, so.

696
00:42:38,891 --> 00:42:41,444
Speaker 0: But speaking of people who have never played role-playing games before you know, what's going on.

697
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:42,650
Speaker 0: This is total tangent.

698
00:42:42,750 --> 00:42:56,170
Speaker 0: Okay, my mom who my dear dear old mom who took my role-playing games books away from me when I was a kid It has is starting a role-playing game club at her high school in High Point, North Carolina.

699
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,195
Speaker 1: Oh, so she's like a teacher there.

700
00:42:57,396 --> 00:42:57,878
Speaker 0: She's a teacher.

701
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,627
Speaker 0: She's been a teacher her whole life.

702
00:43:00,029 --> 00:43:05,563
Speaker 0: So So Yeah, so she's starting a role-playing game club and this is it's.

703
00:43:05,764 --> 00:43:06,908
Speaker 0: I'm gonna loop this back in.

704
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:17,197
Speaker 0: and so I had this really interesting experience in the last year with my mom where I sent her free market and she was like Wow, this is really cool.

705
00:43:17,277 --> 00:43:20,388
Speaker 0: and she had a completely different reaction to it than she had to any of my other stuff.

706
00:43:20,730 --> 00:43:23,101
Speaker 0: like You know, she gets the books that have scary orcs on it.

707
00:43:23,182 --> 00:43:24,810
Speaker 0: Well, she I don't know no dice.

708
00:43:25,451 --> 00:43:29,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, she gets the book and she's like oh nice you made another book it looks nice.

709
00:43:32,011 --> 00:43:34,221
Speaker 0: She got to the free market and she's like wow, this is really cool.

710
00:43:34,302 --> 00:43:36,070
Speaker 0: and she said something she'd never said to me before.

711
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:37,616
Speaker 0: She's like, can I play this?

712
00:43:38,398 --> 00:43:40,305
Speaker 0: and I said, yes, that's what they're for.

713
00:43:40,486 --> 00:43:43,217
Speaker 0: Yes, you can mom She can I play this with my students.

714
00:43:43,238 --> 00:43:46,740
Speaker 0: I was like, yeah, sit down with a few of them You're gonna one of you's gonna have to read the rule book.

715
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,907
Speaker 0: But aside from that go for it.

716
00:43:48,752 --> 00:43:51,425
Speaker 0: So a couple months later, you know, I send her a copy.

717
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:52,370
Speaker 0: This is actually in August.

718
00:43:52,532 --> 00:44:02,915
Speaker 0: I sent her a copy of the mouse card box set uh straight from Gen Con I think and And She calls me up and she's like Freaking out.

719
00:44:03,076 --> 00:44:03,618
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

720
00:44:03,638 --> 00:44:04,662
Speaker 1: This is amazing.

721
00:44:04,823 --> 00:44:05,546
Speaker 0: Ah, I want to.

722
00:44:05,606 --> 00:44:06,570
Speaker 0: I want to play this with my students.

723
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:09,619
Speaker 0: I'm like, what is going on here?

724
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:10,722
Speaker 0: What's happening?

725
00:44:11,043 --> 00:44:16,654
Speaker 0: And I realized it's because the box sets are games to to moms Around the world.

726
00:44:16,674 --> 00:44:18,379
Speaker 0: a box set would.

727
00:44:18,399 --> 00:44:20,585
Speaker 0: that includes everything you need to play is a game.

728
00:44:20,725 --> 00:44:22,310
Speaker 0: a book is something you read.

729
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:25,220
Speaker 0: Right a book isn't something you play.

730
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:26,125
Speaker 0: cuz I get that reaction.

731
00:44:26,166 --> 00:44:26,930
Speaker 0: people all the time like what's that?

732
00:44:26,990 --> 00:44:29,127
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a game and they look at me, but it's a book.

733
00:44:29,207 --> 00:44:29,550
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

734
00:44:29,630 --> 00:44:34,870
Speaker 0: It's a game like choose your own adventure like no, you know, right cuz like a book that contains rules that you use.

735
00:44:35,171 --> 00:44:35,755
Speaker 0: I mean, it's cool.

736
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:44,888
Speaker 0: I love role-playing games and I love and role-playing game books, but But her watching her reaction to mouse card was really profound like she saw it as a game and she is.

737
00:44:44,988 --> 00:44:45,490
Speaker 0: so she's doing it.

738
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:47,371
Speaker 0: She's starting a role-playing game club at her high school And she

739
00:44:47,693 --> 00:44:57,038
Speaker 1: so this is when you first said I thought it was one of those cases were like The students wanted to make a club and they needed an advisor and you're you know, no This is like your mom is trying to get the students together.

740
00:44:57,058 --> 00:44:57,139
Speaker 1: Yeah.

741
00:44:57,339 --> 00:44:57,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

742
00:44:57,540 --> 00:45:01,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's trying to see she she's at a 1400 kid High school so it's pretty big.

743
00:45:01,094 --> 00:45:01,536
Speaker 0: That's big.

744
00:45:01,556 --> 00:45:06,732
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, it's it's pretty big and she is She's caught.

745
00:45:06,773 --> 00:45:08,177
Speaker 0: she asked me she's like, how do I do this?

746
00:45:08,619 --> 00:45:09,843
Speaker 1: She actually know who all the nerds are.

747
00:45:10,324 --> 00:45:17,205
Speaker 0: Well, but I was like you're gonna have chest have like up the founding meeting or something right

748
00:45:17,225 --> 00:45:17,910
Speaker 1: make a charter and

749
00:45:18,772 --> 00:45:30,729
Speaker 0: So I was like you're gonna get a couple kids in the back mom who Are shy and kind of awkward and you need to approach them very gently Because they're probably who you need to get this club going.

750
00:45:31,914 --> 00:45:46,810
Speaker 0: it's like you like you know and you need to kind of let them know that you're here to support them and that you're here not to kind of tease them out and then flay them for the thing that they love but you're actually here to Tell them that what they love to do is awesome and that you need their help to spread the word.

751
00:45:47,674 --> 00:45:53,482
Speaker 0: And and she's like, you know, she's like, okay I'm like, I'm like mom.

752
00:45:53,502 --> 00:45:54,448
Speaker 0: you raised someone.

753
00:45:55,695 --> 00:45:56,429
Speaker 0: It's in your blood.

754
00:45:57,531 --> 00:45:59,818
Speaker 1: Look for the little lukes out there.

755
00:45:59,838 --> 00:46:01,082
Speaker 0: So she's really good.

756
00:46:01,243 --> 00:46:02,005
Speaker 0: Like she's she's.

757
00:46:02,507 --> 00:46:04,877
Speaker 0: she's pretty smart lady So I have faith in her.

758
00:46:04,917 --> 00:46:09,427
Speaker 0: But yeah, so I'm gonna Donate some games down there, too.

759
00:46:10,653 --> 00:46:14,710
Speaker 0: If I ever get my author's copies of the mouse card box set I will send more.

760
00:46:14,911 --> 00:46:22,063
Speaker 2: Well, I was planning that I want to send them to Child's Play because I think that'll get a lot of gamers going I mean but Child's Play tends to only want what they already want, right?

761
00:46:22,123 --> 00:46:23,649
Speaker 1: It's like what the hospitals ask for.

762
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:31,610
Speaker 2: Hospitals like you send them weird stuff and I know because I used to work in hospitals in the Bronx and I saw like the Like Montefiore actually is one of the Child's Play recipients.

763
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:44,729
Speaker 2: Yeah and I saw the kind of stuff that the nurses would get excited about and it was the interesting weird stuff like that Not the stuff that the kids or the hospital itself had asked for that the nurses be like, oh wow And then they'd really get the kids engaged.

764
00:46:44,971 --> 00:46:50,010
Speaker 0: I tried to donate burning wheel books to Child's Play and they told me that they they were thankful and they were polite.

765
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,773
Speaker 0: But they basically they said that they couldn't like Sanitize them.

766
00:46:54,275 --> 00:46:54,918
Speaker 0: Yeah.

767
00:46:54,958 --> 00:46:55,420
Speaker 0: Yeah.

768
00:46:55,460 --> 00:46:55,741
Speaker 1: Yep.

769
00:46:56,183 --> 00:46:57,690
Speaker 1: That's why they only accept new things.

770
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:02,378
Speaker 1: They don't accept used things and they only accept things that come in like a package, you know You can't just send a book.

771
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,330
Speaker 1: It has to be something that's like sealed.

772
00:47:04,410 --> 00:47:10,230
Speaker 1: So actually a shrink-wrap mouse guard box set would work out right because it's a sealed thing.

773
00:47:10,732 --> 00:47:15,869
Speaker 1: But some you know, but a book that's just already open, you know, it might is that you know They can't take anything that's used.

774
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:26,290
Speaker 1: So if you have an action figure on its own no good, but an action figure on a card with the plastic bubble Totally awesome You know because it goes to hospitals where everything's got to be clean, right?

775
00:47:26,350 --> 00:47:26,553
Speaker 1: They don't.

776
00:47:26,573 --> 00:47:27,850
Speaker 1: that's why they don't accept used things.

777
00:47:27,850 --> 00:47:31,010
Speaker 1: So you think the hospital would love if they could take the used things?

778
00:47:31,371 --> 00:47:33,500
Speaker 1: They would love to take the used things for the sick kids.

779
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:35,589
Speaker 2: I know we have like six Gameboy Advances, right?

780
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,215
Speaker 1: So that's why they use things.

781
00:47:37,255 --> 00:47:41,285
Speaker 1: go to toys for you know to the to the poor kids and the new things go to the Sick kids.

782
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:43,556
Speaker 1: That's how it works.

783
00:47:43,939 --> 00:47:44,341
Speaker 0: Interesting.

784
00:47:44,522 --> 00:47:44,783
Speaker 0: Okay.

785
00:47:45,045 --> 00:47:45,910
Speaker 0: Yeah make sense.

786
00:47:46,512 --> 00:47:52,232
Speaker 1: So yeah, if you just maybe if you shrink wrap some burning wheels, then it might I don't know We'll see.

787
00:47:52,253 --> 00:47:53,639
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll get them some copies of Mouse Guard.

788
00:47:53,820 --> 00:47:55,990
Speaker 2: Yeah, that's sort of what's the next step with Mouse Guard?

789
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:58,489
Speaker 2: I mean, it sounds like it's just getting it out getting people to play it.

790
00:47:59,434 --> 00:48:01,483
Speaker 1: There was a rumor of a dark crystal RPG.

791
00:48:01,523 --> 00:48:02,025
Speaker 1: Is that true?

792
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:03,150
Speaker 0: That is a rumor.

793
00:48:03,512 --> 00:48:04,738
Speaker 1: Okay, it is a rumor.

794
00:48:04,798 --> 00:48:05,924
Speaker 0: it is a rumor but it's not.

795
00:48:06,024 --> 00:48:07,170
Speaker 1: it is not a confirmed thing.

796
00:48:08,671 --> 00:48:10,417
Speaker 0: Okay, oh you can google it.

797
00:48:10,477 --> 00:48:13,227
Speaker 0: It's all over the internet and I will tell you it's a rumor.

798
00:48:13,488 --> 00:48:15,696
Speaker 1: All right Because I know you know our.

799
00:48:15,957 --> 00:48:18,991
Speaker 1: it is a weird thing because you know at least from my understanding Right.

800
00:48:19,072 --> 00:48:27,217
Speaker 1: Arkaya has some of these Jim Henson properties such as Fraggle Rock Muppets and you know dark crystal and such right?

801
00:48:27,358 --> 00:48:36,508
Speaker 1: Yep, but I think they got though that license before Disney bought Marvel if I if it's I'm remembering correctly,

802
00:48:36,548 --> 00:48:36,850
Speaker 0: okay

803
00:48:37,574 --> 00:48:57,149
Speaker 1: And which means you know, and it seems like boom studios I think is another comic publisher who had Disney licenses You know before Disney bought Marvel and it seems like what's going on is they're just sort of letting the licenses Expire and like Disney or I think Marvel is already gonna put out like some Pixar comics Like as they're as the licenses are expiring from boom.

804
00:48:57,912 --> 00:49:04,473
Speaker 1: Okay, so if this rumor is true like I'm wondering, you know, you if you might have to do it very quickly I don't know.

805
00:49:04,915 --> 00:49:06,420
Speaker 0: Disney doesn't own those licenses.

806
00:49:06,621 --> 00:49:08,950
Speaker 1: Oh, they don't because Disney does own all the Jim Henson stuff.

807
00:49:09,010 --> 00:49:09,814
Speaker 0: I don't know.

808
00:49:09,854 --> 00:49:12,970
Speaker 0: No, no, no, you are you are conflating two different things.

809
00:49:13,512 --> 00:49:18,730
Speaker 0: Jim Henson sold Disney the Muppets at some point in his over didn't sell him any of the other stuff, correct?

810
00:49:19,892 --> 00:49:22,492
Speaker 0: He was interesting He was.

811
00:49:22,874 --> 00:49:30,050
Speaker 0: he felt like he was done with it and wanted to move on and do other things more elaborate things like labyrinth In the Dark Crystal, so he sold them the Muppets.

812
00:49:31,191 --> 00:49:34,180
Speaker 0: And yeah, Jim Henson also does not own Sesame Street or whatever.

813
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:40,057
Speaker 0: They are contracted to do the puppeteering for The children's theater workshop stuff.

814
00:49:40,097 --> 00:49:40,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, interesting.

815
00:49:40,980 --> 00:49:44,910
Speaker 0: So so yeah, there are three separate entities that are involved with the Muppeteering.

816
00:49:45,031 --> 00:49:45,837
Speaker 1: I've learned something today.

817
00:49:46,623 --> 00:49:53,408
Speaker 1: I'm happy to So sin knowing that dude if it's true make Frogger Rock next cuz.

827
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:24,956
Speaker 2: Well, I mean my experience is that no one seems to think that anything that that's popular should be popular will be popular Would hit any demographic.

828
00:50:25,036 --> 00:50:29,170
Speaker 1: and you think even you know, archaea is a lot more smart and savvy than say a Hasbro.
