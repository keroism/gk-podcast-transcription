1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:14,680
Speaker 0: It's Monday, November 14th, and this is Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

2
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:19,279
Speaker 0: Today we're going to talk about all the websites we read and how we read them.

3
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:23,507
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:28,646
Speaker 0: So today I'm sitting at work, I don't know, this must have been like 10, 11

5
00:00:28,646 --> 00:00:28,766
Speaker 0: a.m.,

6
00:00:28,786 --> 00:00:30,067
Speaker 0: something like that.

7
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:30,296
Speaker 0: Yeah.

8
00:00:30,911 --> 00:00:32,569
Speaker 0: And we hear this music coming outside.

9
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:33,430
Speaker 1: Music?

10
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:35,410
Speaker 0: Like a concert in the street.

11
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,929
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, what story are you on?

12
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:39,869
Speaker 0: We're on the 14th story.

13
00:00:40,371 --> 00:00:41,589
Speaker 1: And the windows don't open, do they?

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:43,669
Speaker 0: They do, but they were only a little bit open.

15
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,930
Speaker 0: But even when we closed them all the way, we still kind of heard the concert.

16
00:00:47,512 --> 00:00:47,884
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

17
00:00:48,651 --> 00:00:49,868
Speaker 0: We didn't know what the concert was.

18
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:59,170
Speaker 0: And being far away and, you know, acoustics of streets not being perfect, awesome concert halls, we didn't know what the hell it was.

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:02,410
Speaker 0: At first we thought it was like some random band.

20
00:01:03,412 --> 00:01:05,730
Speaker 0: The second song sounded like Springsteen, you know.

21
00:01:06,673 --> 00:01:08,507
Speaker 0: So we sent someone down to the street to check it out.

22
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:09,607
Speaker 0: Yep.

23
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:13,509
Speaker 0: So then I sent them with my nice new camera, you know, 'cause--.

24
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:14,429
Speaker 1: So you gave them your camera.

25
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,270
Speaker 0: I gave them the camera to go, you know, and they went down to the street.

26
00:01:18,332 --> 00:01:22,330
Speaker 0: And we found out that the Country Music Awards are in Madison Square Garden tomorrow.

27
00:01:24,457 --> 00:01:24,750
Speaker 1: Okay.

28
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:33,949
Speaker 0: So Garth Brooks was on the top of the Madison Square Garden Penn Station entrance-y thing playing music.

29
00:01:36,136 --> 00:01:36,448
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

30
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:39,550
Speaker 0: And it was kind of weird, 'cause it wasn't that good.

31
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:42,430
Speaker 0: I didn't even know who it was, but then I was remembered.

32
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:47,790
Speaker 0: I was like, that's the guy who won't put his songs on iTunes, 'cause he only releases albums and he doesn't want to divide his tracks.

33
00:01:50,332 --> 00:01:52,570
Speaker 0: And you know, they got some pictures, we put them on the flicker.

34
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:56,450
Speaker 1: So he's basically gonna be kind of like the Metallica of online music.

35
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,290
Speaker 0: I think he is the Metallica of Country Music.

36
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,550
Speaker 1: Well other than Metallica, who is the Metallica of online music.

37
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:02,836
Speaker 1: Yeah.

38
00:02:03,211 --> 00:02:07,845
Speaker 0: But anyway, you know, the camera is like, I didn't have a digital camera, but I wanted one.

39
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:11,689
Speaker 0: And then I got the phone camera, and I was like, oh yeah, I don't need a real camera now.

40
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,750
Speaker 0: Who cares about quality, as long as I get the picture?

41
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,129
Speaker 0: Then the phone camera really didn't cut it.

42
00:02:16,751 --> 00:02:24,729
Speaker 0: And now that I got this digital camera, which isn't even like the greatest one, it's much, much more than I ever needed or wanted, but now it's like, oh yeah!

43
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,188
Speaker 0: Pictures, videos.

44
00:02:28,874 --> 00:02:29,990
Speaker 1: Yeah I gotta get one at some point.

45
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,070
Speaker 1: I mean my cell cam is the crap, and I can't get the pictures off of it.

46
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,550
Speaker 0: Oh right, you didn't get the cable that I got.

47
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,229
Speaker 1: Because there's no cable for my phone.

48
00:02:38,911 --> 00:02:39,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

49
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:48,350
Speaker 1: Because I got some off-brand phone, it's an audio vox, because it was cheap, and it turns out that no one even bothered to make a pirate cable for the audio vox that I have.

50
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:52,790
Speaker 0: Wow, there must be a cable somewhere, it's probably just not as easy to get one from the same way.

51
00:02:52,931 --> 00:02:54,690
Speaker 1: I found one site that claimed to have one.

52
00:02:54,951 --> 00:03:00,510
Speaker 1: One and only one site, and it looked so shady, I wouldn't even consider giving them a credit card.

53
00:03:00,671 --> 00:03:03,090
Speaker 0: I wouldn't consider giving anything shady a credit card.

54
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:06,850
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll give Licksang my money, and that's really about as low as I'll go.

55
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:12,050
Speaker 0: I'd sooner buy another brand of cable and then modify it than go to the shady website.

56
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:16,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't even know if the software on the Linux will even support my phone.

57
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,088
Speaker 1: My phone's weird.

58
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:20,510
Speaker 0: Well, Bitpim has a list of phones it supports, if you're on the list you're good.

59
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:20,967
Speaker 0: You know what?

60
00:03:21,172 --> 00:03:21,889
Speaker 1: I'm not on the list.

61
00:03:22,396 --> 00:03:22,747
Speaker 0: Oh, well then.

62
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:26,349
Speaker 1: You didn't realize how hard it was to even find out what my phone actually is?

63
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:29,450
Speaker 0: Isn't it like a saying whatever?

64
00:03:29,530 --> 00:03:32,429
Speaker 1: No, it's an audio vox, P-M number number number number.

65
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:32,984
Speaker 0: Alright.

66
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:35,870
Speaker 1: Doesn't say it anywhere on the phone, it just says Qualcomm on the phone.

67
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,770
Speaker 0: Qualcomm makes the chip in the phone.

68
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:38,168
Speaker 1: I know.

69
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:40,590
Speaker 1: It says Qualcomm on the phone, it says Sprint on the phone.

70
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:49,309
Speaker 1: I eventually found a picture of my phone online, and under that picture I discovered the actual phone that I had and what company made it.

71
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:49,721
Speaker 0: Wow.

72
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:58,490
Speaker 0: I mean, when I got my phone it was just like the generic whatever phone they had, because they had a choice between a camera and a speakerphone, and I got the camera.

73
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,409
Speaker 0: It's just a Samsung whatever, but it works great with the cable and the software and everything.

74
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:05,750
Speaker 1: So you remember the trouble I had?

75
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,549
Speaker 1: I didn't want a camera, and I couldn't get a phone without one.

76
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, when I went to get this phone you could still get one without a camera.

77
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:15,869
Speaker 1: Well yeah, there were a couple that didn't have the camera, but they were really really crappy phones.

78
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:21,785
Speaker 1: And I didn't want a non-camera for any Luddite reason, I technically can't have a camera at work.

79
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:23,309
Speaker 0: Well, you can get away with it now.

80
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,167
Speaker 1: Well yeah, because I just don't take pictures of anything, but technically it's against the rules.

81
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:28,075
Speaker 0: Oh no!

82
00:04:28,994 --> 00:04:29,078
Speaker 0: Yeah.

83
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:30,470
Speaker 0: What are you going to do?

84
00:04:31,111 --> 00:04:32,790
Speaker 1: Not take pictures of sensitive things.

85
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:35,210
Speaker 0: Not have a phone is the other choice.

86
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:42,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's kind of a pain, because when we go to Oticon, even if you have a camera on your cellphone, they won't let you take your cellphone into the art area.

87
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,150
Speaker 1: I took it in anyway when they weren't looking.

88
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,129
Speaker 1: They never checked me.

89
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:50,248
Speaker 1: They asked me, they're like, "Hey, you got a cellphone, does it have a camera on

90
00:04:50,289 --> 00:04:50,329
Speaker 1: it?".

91
00:04:50,732 --> 00:04:51,177
Speaker 1: And I said,

92
00:04:51,197 --> 00:04:51,238
Speaker 1: "No.".

93
00:04:53,075 --> 00:04:53,689
Speaker 1: And they didn't look.

94
00:04:54,830 --> 00:05:02,507
Speaker 0: I figured I could just, I wouldn't, I'd bring my digital camera and stuff in there, because they never checked me for anything when I was there last year, but I wouldn't actually use it.

95
00:05:03,032 --> 00:05:06,849
Speaker 0: I just don't want to have to go through the inconvenience of bringing it out, bringing it in, bringing it out.

96
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:16,789
Speaker 1: See, when I went to Katsucon, and they had Saiko Lesemu there, and they checked everyone, and if you had a cellphone with a camera in it, they wouldn't let you in.

97
00:05:17,091 --> 00:05:17,830
Speaker 0: Well, bad.

98
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,369
Speaker 1: And if they caught you with one in there, they kicked you out.

99
00:05:20,790 --> 00:05:25,690
Speaker 0: Well, see, I would have just, you know, let me bring it in, and I won't use it, you know?

100
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,030
Speaker 1: But they can't see if you use it or not.

101
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:27,910
Speaker 1: They don't want you to bring it in.

102
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:29,130
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean, serious.

103
00:05:29,572 --> 00:05:30,548
Speaker 0: That's true, but I mean...

104
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:36,130
Speaker 1: It doesn't help that, as much as I love Japanese music, Japanese musicians seem to be really, really afraid of cameras.

105
00:05:36,572 --> 00:05:40,129
Speaker 0: Well, knowing how crazy Japanese people are with cameras, I can't really blame them.

106
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,490
Speaker 1: Except in the city, when I saw Despair is Ray, the viewers were taking pictures the whole time, and they didn't seem to care.

107
00:05:47,351 --> 00:05:49,150
Speaker 0: Ah, they must have been a smaller band.

108
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:56,189
Speaker 1: Of course, they're a very, like, they're actually a pretty big band, but they're very loud and very punk, and they spit on the audience at the end.

109
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,489
Speaker 0: Okay.

110
00:05:58,234 --> 00:05:58,445
Speaker 1: Yeah.

111
00:05:59,051 --> 00:06:00,930
Speaker 1: So I can say that I was spit on by the lead singer.

112
00:06:01,052 --> 00:06:01,950
Speaker 1: They spit like water.

113
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:03,648
Speaker 1: Like, the kind of thing Rammstein always does.

114
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,367
Speaker 0: Rammstein doesn't spit water.

115
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:06,508
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do.

116
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:07,460
Speaker 1: I spit fire.

117
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:12,049
Speaker 1: Nah, fire with water, water with fire, fake urine.

118
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:13,425
Speaker 0: Excretions.

119
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:17,107
Speaker 0: Real excretions.

120
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:19,689
Speaker 0: Rammstein's big on the fire.

121
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why a lot of people say you can't actually see them in the

122
00:06:23,826 --> 00:06:24,168
Speaker 1: U.S.,

123
00:06:24,248 --> 00:06:25,430
Speaker 1: because they can't do all the things they do.

124
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:26,746
Speaker 0: I don't think they do the shows in the U.S.

125
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:27,090
Speaker 0: anymore.

126
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:28,590
Speaker 0: I don't remember when they did a show, period.

127
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:30,400
Speaker 1: They've done a few in the

128
00:06:30,441 --> 00:06:30,501
Speaker 1: U.S.,

129
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:31,490
Speaker 1: I have some friends who went to them.

130
00:06:31,670 --> 00:06:35,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the shows in, like, Germany and Canada have, like, crazy fires.

131
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:39,070
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, because Germany and Canada don't try to protect their citizens from themselves.

132
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:40,509
Speaker 1: Mmm, good plan.

133
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,010
Speaker 1: You want to go watch some crazy guy with fire and stand right there?

134
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:45,879
Speaker 0: Maybe that's why their citizens are less stupid, because a lot more of the stupid ones are dead.

135
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:53,330
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's personified by the one time I went up to Canada, and I remember there was a cliff next to this restaurant, and there was a little sign.

136
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:59,923
Speaker 1: And the sign didn't say, like, "Keep away," or "Danger, stay away from this," or "You'll get in trouble if you walk over

137
00:06:59,984 --> 00:07:00,126
Speaker 1: here.".

138
00:07:00,913 --> 00:07:03,090
Speaker 1: It said, "Warning, cliff.

139
00:07:03,890 --> 00:07:05,305
Speaker 1: We're not responsible if you hurt

140
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:05,709
Speaker 1: yourself.".

141
00:07:07,023 --> 00:07:07,108
Speaker 0: Eh?

142
00:07:07,511 --> 00:07:08,730
Speaker 1: There was no fence, there was nothing.

143
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:09,710
Speaker 1: It was just a cliff and a little sign.

144
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:19,390
Speaker 0: In America, if you had that same sign, in fact, no matter how many signs and railings you had, if someone fell over and didn't die by some miracle, or even if they died, their family could still sue you for having a cliff.

145
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:22,830
Speaker 1: Your only hope is if the whole family falls off and dies, then they can't sue you.

146
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,850
Speaker 0: And all the friends and relatives.

147
00:07:24,212 --> 00:07:25,389
Speaker 1: And everyone who ever cared about them.

148
00:07:26,576 --> 00:07:27,109
Speaker 0: And their boss.

149
00:07:28,052 --> 00:07:29,210
Speaker 1: Eh, the boss would probably not sue.

150
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:30,050
Speaker 1: He probably wouldn't even know.

151
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,710
Speaker 0: You destroyed my most valuable employee with your dangerous cliff.

152
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,790
Speaker 1: I'd somehow doubt that your most valuable employee was dumb enough to fall off a cliff.

153
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:38,090
Speaker 0: Could be real dumb company.

154
00:07:41,331 --> 00:07:46,309
Speaker 1: So anyway, I see that Warner Brothers is trying to actually jump onto this whole internet thing.

155
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:48,110
Speaker 0: Are they doing it properly?

156
00:07:49,111 --> 00:07:53,008
Speaker 1: Actually, they're doing it more properly than I would have ever expected from a company connected to AOL.

157
00:07:54,812 --> 00:07:56,950
Speaker 1: They're offering 100 TV shows for free.

158
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,130
Speaker 0: 100 TV shows?

159
00:07:58,333 --> 00:07:58,930
Speaker 0: Every episode?

160
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:00,649
Speaker 1: Uh, doesn't say.

161
00:08:01,293 --> 00:08:04,410
Speaker 0: Uh, 'cause I mean 100 episodes of 100 different shows is kinda eh.

162
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:07,330
Speaker 0: 100 full shows beginning to end.

163
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,010
Speaker 0: That's something.

164
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:12,370
Speaker 1: Well this is the pilot and it's supposed to expand after they see how well this goes.

165
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:16,110
Speaker 0: Ah, alright, so someone finally put out the shows in great enough number.

166
00:08:16,553 --> 00:08:16,929
Speaker 0: Is it free?

167
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:17,629
Speaker 1: It's free.

168
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:18,468
Speaker 0: It's free.

169
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:31,069
Speaker 1: The only downsides are, they haven't said exactly yet, but it looks like you either have to use their proprietary player or something, it's kinda like iTunes, in that it's not really super DRM, but they'll know what you watch.

170
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,010
Speaker 1: Like you can't just download it out.

171
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:33,828
Speaker 0: Oh, they're ads.

172
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:37,350
Speaker 1: There are one to two minutes of ads per episode, and they may-.

173
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:39,347
Speaker 0: One to two minutes is good compared to TV.

174
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:41,948
Speaker 0: God, TV, where it's like- Are they gonna up it?

175
00:08:42,575 --> 00:08:42,926
Speaker 1: I don't know.

176
00:08:43,691 --> 00:08:44,350
Speaker 0: This is brand new.

177
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,389
Speaker 0: One question is are they gonna up the ads?

178
00:08:46,891 --> 00:08:48,770
Speaker 0: Is the DRM evil or okay?

179
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:49,689
Speaker 1: It seems to be okay.

180
00:08:49,850 --> 00:08:52,330
Speaker 1: The one cool thing- Will it work on the Linux and other things?

181
00:08:52,490 --> 00:09:06,270
Speaker 1: The one thing that's really cool is that it's effectively a bit torrent, because when you download it, part of the requirement is that the player and the downloader act as servers for other people who want to download the content, thus saving AOL all that bandwidth.

182
00:09:06,910 --> 00:09:07,429
Speaker 0: Well, you know what?

183
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:08,788
Speaker 0: It's all good, because you know what?

184
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:23,010
Speaker 0: No matter how evil the DRM is, within a week of it coming out, someone will have cracked it, and they'll remove the commercials, and they'll put it in an AVI, a normal MPEG4 file, and they'll share it on the real bit torrent, and everyone will be happy.

185
00:09:23,651 --> 00:09:25,690
Speaker 1: What I wonder is are they gonna support the Linux?

186
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:29,789
Speaker 0: If they don't support the Linux, we just have to wait for that crack guy to help us out.

187
00:09:30,151 --> 00:09:30,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

188
00:09:31,111 --> 00:09:31,347
Speaker 0: You know?

189
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:36,329
Speaker 0: And then we'll download all the files or whatever, you know, and then convert them so we can actually watch them, and we'll be good.

190
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:39,710
Speaker 0: I mean, in a hundred shows, there's gotta be at least one show we wanna watch.

191
00:09:40,491 --> 00:09:41,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, possibly.

192
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:44,670
Speaker 1: The problem is all the shows I really wanna watch, not many other people wanna watch.

193
00:09:44,852 --> 00:09:45,124
Speaker 1: I don't know.

194
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,870
Speaker 0: I saw that they were gonna have that Fugitive show that I never saw.

195
00:09:48,834 --> 00:09:50,090
Speaker 1: Ah, I've only seen a little bit of that.

196
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,008
Speaker 1: My dad used to watch it.

197
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:52,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, Rudy told me to watch it.

198
00:09:53,090 --> 00:10:00,970
Speaker 0: So Google came out with a website statistics thingy today called Google Analytics.

199
00:10:02,351 --> 00:10:04,890
Speaker 1: Does it do anything more than, like, AWStats does?

200
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:13,030
Speaker 0: It looks a lot fancier and cleaner than AWStats, and it looks like it provides more accurate information, 'cause it's not a log parser.

201
00:10:13,872 --> 00:10:27,929
Speaker 0: What it is is JavaScript, and anyone who visits your webpage, the JavaScript kinda grabs 'em, and it uses Google, which, you know, what better could you use than Google to help it out and figure out, you know, visitors, how long they stay, everything it can figure out.

202
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:39,310
Speaker 0: The only thing is it doesn't, I don't think it works better than AWStats enough to merit adding the JavaScript to your site and then sharing all your information with Google.

203
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:41,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, I trust Google.

204
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:43,789
Speaker 1: Google already knows a lot about me.

205
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:45,550
Speaker 1: Google has figured out where I live.

206
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:51,069
Speaker 1: They've figured out that my two, I have two Gmail accounts, and they seem to have figured out that they're both the same person.

207
00:10:52,091 --> 00:11:02,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, but imagine now, Google's not only gonna have all that, but they're gonna have all these statistics about people visiting, they're just gonna be able to now-- Wait, wait, Google's gonna have statistics about people visiting websites.

208
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:04,050
Speaker 0: Well, this is about people searching.

209
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:07,510
Speaker 0: Now they actually, imagine if every side of the internet used this.

210
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:13,090
Speaker 0: Google would know everything that everyone is looking at for how long and everything.

211
00:11:13,170 --> 00:11:15,389
Speaker 1: See, I'm kind of fine with that because I still trust him.

212
00:11:16,330 --> 00:11:19,870
Speaker 0: Still, but, you know, he gets more big brother every day.

213
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:21,670
Speaker 0: It's like if you had big brother but you didn't do anything.

214
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:23,610
Speaker 0: He knows everything, does nothing.

215
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:25,850
Speaker 1: But see, I'm 50/50 on the whole big brother thing.

216
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:39,210
Speaker 1: See, I dislike the idea of a government watching everything I do and going after me, but at the same time, if it were accessible to everyone, where everyone can see what everyone's up to, that'd be great because no one could lie anymore.

217
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:41,929
Speaker 0: Yep, but here's the one thing, though, I worry about Google.

218
00:11:42,571 --> 00:11:47,029
Speaker 0: I'm not worried so much that Google will take all their hordes and hordes of information and do something evil.

219
00:11:47,771 --> 00:11:53,629
Speaker 0: I'm worried that someone will come around, like a government, and say, "Oh, Google, we got you and now we're taking all your information and we're looking at

220
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:53,689
Speaker 0: it.".

221
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:54,747
Speaker 1: You know what I think Google would do?

222
00:11:55,793 --> 00:11:57,290
Speaker 1: I'll bet they've got a contingency for that.

223
00:11:57,390 --> 00:12:00,610
Speaker 1: They would probably just jump ship and be out of this country within a week.

224
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:12,689
Speaker 0: I don't know, but still, it's kind of, you know, just the fact that it's there, it's like this nukes and you might be 100% sure your government's never actually gonna go and have a war with them, but they're there.

225
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:14,831
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's why I said I'm 50/50.

226
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:15,390
Speaker 1: I'm ambivalent.

227
00:12:15,711 --> 00:12:18,210
Speaker 1: I really don't know either way.

228
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:21,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'll stick with the AWB stats because it's good enough for my needs.

229
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:26,828
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean, I'd say we would switch to it if Google offered something that we couldn't do or if it was worth it.

230
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:27,246
Speaker 0: Yeah.

231
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:29,909
Speaker 1: It's always the trade-off, and if it's worth the trade-off, I'll do it.

232
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:45,469
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is I would also use it if I used the Google AdWords because it's integrated with the AdWords, and so if you're the guy who makes like, you know, $1,000 a month from the Google Ads and stuff on your site, it's definitely worth it to use this instead of your whatever other stat thingies.

233
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:49,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though I'm generally very much against the ads.

234
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:56,130
Speaker 0: I'm against the ads too, but it pays off a lot, and it's pretty unintrusive and easy.

235
00:12:57,110 --> 00:13:02,390
Speaker 0: You know, and a lot of people who websites you wouldn't have otherwise survive on little tiny AdWords.

236
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:04,807
Speaker 1: Like a lot of people say, "Oh, I only block annoying

237
00:13:04,988 --> 00:13:05,149
Speaker 1: ads.".

238
00:13:05,656 --> 00:13:06,669
Speaker 1: I block all ads.

239
00:13:06,852 --> 00:13:08,109
Speaker 1: I block every ad I can.

240
00:13:08,332 --> 00:13:09,209
Speaker 1: I even block Google AdSense.

241
00:13:09,630 --> 00:13:10,889
Speaker 0: I block every ad I can block.

242
00:13:11,915 --> 00:13:12,369
Speaker 0: Every last one.

243
00:13:12,490 --> 00:13:15,905
Speaker 1: The only ads I can't block are the ones in The Escapist, and I don't really care, I just skip them.

244
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:16,757
Speaker 0: Yeah.

245
00:13:17,371 --> 00:13:18,569
Speaker 0: One day I'll find out how to block those.

246
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:24,210
Speaker 1: See, I don't mind them so much because The Escapist is like reading a magazine, and when I read a magazine, the ads don't even register.

247
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:26,730
Speaker 1: It's just I flip the page again, and then I continue reading.

248
00:13:27,970 --> 00:13:31,170
Speaker 0: Actually, Marvel Comics recently, they made their ads a lot better.

249
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:32,809
Speaker 0: They've put them all at the end of the comic book now.

250
00:13:33,295 --> 00:13:33,648
Speaker 1: Oh, great.

251
00:13:34,192 --> 00:13:34,282
Speaker 0: Yeah.

252
00:13:34,530 --> 00:13:35,969
Speaker 0: So now it's just like, "Read, read, read, read, read.

253
00:13:36,030 --> 00:13:37,350
Speaker 0: Hey, there's a bunch of pages left.

254
00:13:37,491 --> 00:13:37,705
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

255
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:42,485
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm done," which actually adds a bonus because now you're not sure when you're near the end.

256
00:13:42,952 --> 00:13:44,065
Speaker 0: Before, you'd be like, "Oh, it's almost

257
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:44,349
Speaker 0: over.".

258
00:13:44,493 --> 00:13:44,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

259
00:13:44,970 --> 00:13:46,080
Speaker 0: Now it's like, "Oh, it

260
00:13:46,403 --> 00:13:46,483
Speaker 0: ends.".

261
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,450
Speaker 0: You don't know when the end is coming, which kind of improves it.

262
00:13:49,550 --> 00:13:50,690
Speaker 1: Plus, you always had to shift gears.

263
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,490
Speaker 1: Like, "I'm reading a comic.

264
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,168
Speaker 1: I'm reading a comic.

265
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:52,752
Speaker 1: Ad.

266
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:54,370
Speaker 1: I'm reading a comic.

267
00:13:54,935 --> 00:13:55,041
Speaker 0: Ad."

268
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:55,589
Speaker 0: Yep.

269
00:13:56,196 --> 00:13:56,509
Speaker 0: No more.

270
00:13:56,933 --> 00:13:57,488
Speaker 0: It's all good now.

271
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:04,350
Speaker 1: And the Xbox 360 list of games was released.

272
00:14:04,993 --> 00:14:10,388
Speaker 0: I think, you know, we knew a bunch of the games already, but I guess this now must be a complete official list.

273
00:14:10,730 --> 00:14:12,050
Speaker 1: This is the official list, as far as I can tell.

274
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,230
Speaker 0: The games that will be out the same day the system comes out?

275
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,029
Speaker 1: Yes, and there's a whole bunch of them, and they're almost all sports games.

276
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:18,869
Speaker 0: All sports games are easy to make.

277
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:22,550
Speaker 1: There's FIFA, Madden, two NBA's, NHL.

278
00:14:22,950 --> 00:14:23,609
Speaker 0: Two NBA's.

279
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,306
Speaker 0: Are they both from EA?

280
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,090
Speaker 1: NBA 2K6 from 2K Sports, and NBA Live 06 from EA.

281
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:29,483
Speaker 1: Okay.

282
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,250
Speaker 0: So they put the whole EA Sports line right away.

283
00:14:32,492 --> 00:14:32,646
Speaker 0: Yep.

284
00:14:32,993 --> 00:14:34,829
Speaker 1: And a couple racing games.

285
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:35,749
Speaker 1: What racing game?

286
00:14:36,532 --> 00:14:37,529
Speaker 1: Project Gotham Racing.

287
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:42,910
Speaker 0: Well, Project Gotham Racing's never played, but that's a real popular Xbox racing, but it's not my kind of racing.

288
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:46,250
Speaker 1: See, I played it once, and it reminds me a lot of those racing games I hate.

289
00:14:46,719 --> 00:14:46,850
Speaker 1: Oh.

290
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:48,330
Speaker 1: I really can't elaborate more than that.

291
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:55,190
Speaker 1: It's the very linear... It's more a game of avoiding obstacles than a game of knowing how to take the proper line.

292
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:56,129
Speaker 0: Like Rush Racing?

293
00:14:57,236 --> 00:14:57,790
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah.

294
00:14:58,471 --> 00:14:59,190
Speaker 0: Cruisin' something?

295
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,190
Speaker 0: I never played it, so I don't know, but I know about it.

296
00:15:02,251 --> 00:15:03,010
Speaker 1: I played it once or twice.

297
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:03,560
Speaker 1: I didn't like it.

298
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:05,848
Speaker 0: Ridge Racer's okay.

299
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:06,487
Speaker 0: It could be good.

300
00:15:06,992 --> 00:15:07,080
Speaker 0: Yeah.

301
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:07,950
Speaker 0: There's no wheel.

302
00:15:08,451 --> 00:15:11,130
Speaker 1: I gotta say, though, the last Ridge Racer I played was one.

303
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:14,062
Speaker 0: We played Ridge Racer 2 or 3 at, uh, Jersey.

304
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:15,755
Speaker 1: No.

305
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:16,970
Speaker 1: It was broken, remember?

306
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,030
Speaker 0: Well, I played half of it.

307
00:15:18,091 --> 00:15:18,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, you played half of it.

308
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:21,770
Speaker 1: I played the broken half, and I couldn't move, because I couldn't get out of first gear.

309
00:15:21,850 --> 00:15:23,510
Speaker 0: People gotta maintain their arcade machines.

310
00:15:24,071 --> 00:15:26,450
Speaker 1: Oh, and that gun game we've been seeing ads for everywhere.

311
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:28,449
Speaker 0: I found out today what that game actually is.

312
00:15:28,571 --> 00:15:28,969
Speaker 1: What is it?

313
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:30,109
Speaker 0: It's GTA in the Wild West.

314
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:31,082
Speaker 1: Oh.

315
00:15:31,832 --> 00:15:32,127
Speaker 1: Great.

316
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:33,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

317
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:33,881
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

318
00:15:35,271 --> 00:15:36,790
Speaker 1: And, uh, there's a Perfect Dark Zero.

319
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually, that's a game I kinda wanna play.

320
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,190
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the only game in the lineup that I'm actually kinda interested in.

321
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:45,690
Speaker 0: 'Cause I played Perfect Dark in the N64, and it was, like, Goldeneye plus plus.

322
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:51,370
Speaker 0: And now, they got that, which I think, if it's good, it'll be Goldeneye plus plus plus.

323
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:51,995
Speaker 1: Yeah.

324
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:54,309
Speaker 0: It's at least Halo plus plus.

325
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:59,313
Speaker 1: See, I'm not really too hatin' on the Xbox 360.

326
00:15:59,313 --> 00:16:00,870
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not that bad a system.

327
00:16:01,731 --> 00:16:02,706
Speaker 1: Especially compared to the PS3.

328
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:06,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm probably gonna get one of the controllers if it's good enough and plug it in.

329
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:09,749
Speaker 0: 'Cause they're makin' controllers of Xbox 360 for the PC.

330
00:16:10,395 --> 00:16:10,610
Speaker 0: Yeah.

331
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,390
Speaker 0: It's gonna be, like, the standard controller.

332
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,290
Speaker 1: It's gotta be better than our GamePad Pro.

333
00:16:15,097 --> 00:16:15,350
Speaker 0: Yeah.

334
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:19,570
Speaker 1: Which is great, except that it always hits the diagonal buttons, which is bad for old.

335
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:22,970
Speaker 0: Well, it's really just a sticky, the plus part is no good.

336
00:16:23,150 --> 00:16:24,930
Speaker 1: 'Cause it's not actually a plus, it's a circle.

337
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,270
Speaker 1: It differs.

338
00:16:25,270 --> 00:16:28,690
Speaker 0: Back in the day, the original Gravis GamePad, which I still have, was great.

339
00:16:29,290 --> 00:16:33,070
Speaker 0: And then, they finally made 'em PlayStation style, with the Gravis Grip.

340
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:36,050
Speaker 0: And I had the Gravis Grip, and it was great, but it broke.

341
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:39,269
Speaker 0: And then, they came out with the USB ones.

342
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:43,890
Speaker 0: So I got the USB one, and it's just a, it's really cheap.

343
00:16:44,030 --> 00:16:45,790
Speaker 0: But it works really well, but it's really cheap.

344
00:16:46,470 --> 00:16:51,429
Speaker 1: Yeah, though I'd rather have, what I wanna get is one of those Licksang adaptory things, and just have a Super Nintendo controller.

345
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:54,370
Speaker 0: Super Nintendo controller is good, but doesn't have the analog.

346
00:16:54,571 --> 00:16:59,510
Speaker 1: See, that's fine, because there currently aren't any games that require analog that I can easily emulate.

347
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:01,006
Speaker 1: I mean, we actually have a PS1.

348
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:03,250
Speaker 0: But here's the thing you're not thinking about.

349
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:06,029
Speaker 0: We get some Atari emulator, all of a sudden, huh?

350
00:17:06,510 --> 00:17:08,490
Speaker 0: You wanna play like a little flight sim, like a Star Fox?

351
00:17:09,109 --> 00:17:12,150
Speaker 0: You know, Star Fox doesn't need analog, but it helps it a lot.

352
00:17:12,790 --> 00:17:16,450
Speaker 0: Get an N64 emulator on there, you need an analog right away, or else you're screwed.

353
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:18,709
Speaker 1: Yeah, if we get an N64 emulator, which we don't have yet.

354
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:21,770
Speaker 1: So we'll, you know what, we'll burn that bridge after we cross it.

355
00:17:21,869 --> 00:17:31,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw a thing yesterday about the, um, there's an N64, they modded the ROM of Zelda 64 to increase the resolution and the textures.

356
00:17:32,511 --> 00:17:35,270
Speaker 1: Oh, I was worried you were gonna say something like Awful Fantasy.

357
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:37,969
Speaker 0: No, no, no, it looks really bright and colorful, it's pretty cool.

358
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:38,515
Speaker 0: Huh.

359
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:44,770
Speaker 0: It's a lot better than the, you know, the fake HDTV that some of the 360 games are doing.

360
00:17:45,110 --> 00:17:50,142
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, one of the big marketing things for the Xbox 360 is that, "Oh, it's HD, it's HD!

361
00:17:50,371 --> 00:17:52,703
Speaker 1: In fact, it has to be HD, games can't come out that aren't

362
00:17:52,824 --> 00:17:52,864
Speaker 1: HD!".

363
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,810
Speaker 1: And I think when I was at Slashdot, we saw that a bunch of games aren't actually HD, they just up-sample after they do all the rendering.

364
00:18:00,130 --> 00:18:00,198
Speaker 0: Yep.

365
00:18:00,611 --> 00:18:03,550
Speaker 0: Oh, there's one pixel, but the resolution needs to be four times as big.

366
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,910
Speaker 0: Well, we'll just put a bunch of pixels of the same color to make a big pixel.

367
00:18:07,436 --> 00:18:07,649
Speaker 0: Hahaha.

368
00:18:09,551 --> 00:18:12,790
Speaker 0: Alright, so, uh, you know Douglas Rushkoff, my favorite dude here.

369
00:18:12,790 --> 00:18:12,923
Speaker 1: Hero?

370
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:14,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

371
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:15,189
Speaker 0: I like him, he's a good dude.

372
00:18:15,210 --> 00:18:16,390
Speaker 0: He's a good dude, right?

373
00:18:16,571 --> 00:18:17,745
Speaker 0: Not a lot of people know about him.

374
00:18:18,271 --> 00:18:19,989
Speaker 0: But, um, he's got a new book.

375
00:18:20,573 --> 00:18:21,148
Speaker 1: A new book, eh?

376
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:25,410
Speaker 0: It's called Get Back in the Box, Innovation from the Inside Out.

377
00:18:26,571 --> 00:18:35,390
Speaker 0: And the books are pretty much, uh, the main idea of the book is all you stupid companies doing marketing and branding and all that other crap, just make your product not suck.

378
00:18:37,270 --> 00:18:38,130
Speaker 0: You know, do a Google.

379
00:18:39,612 --> 00:18:40,609
Speaker 0: But that's the main idea.

380
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,475
Speaker 0: But it has a lot of stuff about.

381
00:18:42,536 --> 00:18:46,490
Speaker 0: one of Rushkoff's favorite ideas of mine is the social currency.

382
00:18:47,834 --> 00:18:49,190
Speaker 0: You know what the social currency is, right?

383
00:18:49,290 --> 00:18:49,949
Speaker 0: Did I explain that to you?

384
00:18:50,591 --> 00:18:52,469
Speaker 1: Uh, we got some friends who use social currency.

385
00:18:53,070 --> 00:19:01,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, so social currency is, um, let's say you go to the store and you buy a video game, right?

386
00:19:02,051 --> 00:19:06,487
Speaker 0: Now, sure, you're gonna use the video game to play it for what it is and get entertainment out of it, right?

387
00:19:07,073 --> 00:19:09,350
Speaker 0: But the video game can also act as social currency.

388
00:19:09,711 --> 00:19:11,649
Speaker 1: It's like a magnet that'll bring people to you.

389
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:14,429
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not really a magnet to bring people to you.

390
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:16,510
Speaker 1: Well, it's a magnet to get people around.

391
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,230
Speaker 0: No, it's not to get people.

392
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:26,910
Speaker 0: It's, you use it, you have social interaction through the item or through the brand.

393
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:32,766
Speaker 0: So a good example is, let's say you get a Mazda car, right?

394
00:19:34,533 --> 00:19:35,690
Speaker 0: A rice car, right?

395
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:44,830
Speaker 0: And whereas normally the companies are thinking that you wanna have a conversation, you know, with them about the stuff, right?

396
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:53,890
Speaker 0: Now what you do with social currency is you use the products and the brands as something you talk through to other people.

397
00:19:54,571 --> 00:20:08,270
Speaker 0: So you know, you meet another ricer guy and you can use your car or your, you know, brand or your items or your t-shirt or whatever to make it as a pathway for social interaction.

398
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:08,945
Speaker 1: Great.

399
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:10,288
Speaker 1: My fin is bigger than yours.

400
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, well my fart pipe is bigger than yours.

401
00:20:12,730 --> 00:20:13,524
Speaker 0: That's exactly it.

402
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:17,150
Speaker 0: And you know, it's really cool stuff.

403
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,850
Speaker 0: And if you like reading non-fiction and that sort of thing, it's a good book.

404
00:20:24,194 --> 00:20:24,727
Speaker 1: Have you read it?

405
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:28,089
Speaker 0: No, but I might win it because there was a contest.

406
00:20:28,952 --> 00:20:30,089
Speaker 1: You know, I might win the lottery.

407
00:20:30,635 --> 00:20:30,969
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

408
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:35,310
Speaker 0: There was a contest of who could give the best example of social currency and I submitted an entry.

409
00:20:35,410 --> 00:20:35,908
Speaker 0: We'll see if I win.

410
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:36,890
Speaker 0: Uh huh.

411
00:20:37,031 --> 00:20:37,870
Speaker 0: I submitted Nintendo.

412
00:20:38,091 --> 00:20:43,048
Speaker 0: Because, I mean, talk about the t-shirts with the mushrooms on them, it doesn't get more social currency than that.

413
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:51,463
Speaker 0: You know, and the Nintendo DS, I mean, talk about not only are you talking through the brand with the Nintendo DS, you're talking with the product.

414
00:20:52,105 --> 00:20:53,906
Speaker 0: that is the brand through the brand.

415
00:20:54,575 --> 00:20:55,549
Speaker 0: It doesn't get better than that.

416
00:20:55,970 --> 00:20:58,090
Speaker 1: You know, speaking of the DS, uh, tomorrow.

417
00:20:58,410 --> 00:20:59,010
Speaker 0: Mario Kart.

418
00:20:59,352 --> 00:21:00,010
Speaker 1: Mario Kart.

419
00:21:00,371 --> 00:21:01,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, there might not be a podcast tomorrow.

420
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:07,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, see the last time a game like this came out, we disappeared from the world for a while.

421
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:08,588
Speaker 0: What game was that?

422
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:09,667
Speaker 1: Advance Wars DS.

423
00:21:10,233 --> 00:21:10,668
Speaker 0: Oh god!

424
00:21:11,550 --> 00:21:25,310
Speaker 1: We were in Wildwood, at the Jersey Shore, and instead of swimming and playing DDR or In the Groove 2 on the boardwalk, we were all sitting in the beach house, we could hear the beach through the window, we were in the beach house playing Advance Wars.

425
00:21:26,150 --> 00:21:26,214
Speaker 0: Mmm.

426
00:21:26,870 --> 00:21:31,470
Speaker 0: We went to the store like three times, for like three days.

427
00:21:31,711 --> 00:21:33,889
Speaker 1: We almost bought the store out, there were so many of us.

428
00:21:34,211 --> 00:21:35,269
Speaker 0: We bought six copies.

429
00:21:36,711 --> 00:21:39,329
Speaker 1: And we also bought a DS among all of us.

430
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,410
Speaker 1: Two DS's in fact.

431
00:21:40,430 --> 00:21:41,769
Speaker 0: Well didn't they buy those at Target, I think?

432
00:21:42,370 --> 00:21:50,189
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, because the store was sold out of the Advance Wars, they didn't have it yet, so we went to the Target and got the DS's, then we went back to the other store the next day and got the games.

433
00:21:50,611 --> 00:21:51,730
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, those are good days.

434
00:21:52,252 --> 00:21:52,889
Speaker 1: Ah, good days.

435
00:21:53,450 --> 00:22:05,725
Speaker 0: So yeah, Mario Kart's got the wifi, I'm gonna be playing against people that I know far away for many hours, and I'm going to practice every day on the train and become just as good as that as I was at GBA.

436
00:22:05,786 --> 00:22:06,290
Speaker 0: Mario Kart.

437
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're already pretty damn good at Mario Kart, I gotta say.

438
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:11,030
Speaker 0: Everyone will bow down before my mad skills.

439
00:22:11,451 --> 00:22:13,990
Speaker 1: I mean, I can't deny that you're good at Mario Kart.

440
00:22:14,371 --> 00:22:16,830
Speaker 0: I'm only really good at the Game Boy One and the SNES one.

441
00:22:17,332 --> 00:22:20,210
Speaker 0: The N64 one I'm okay at, but the computer cheats and I don't like it.

442
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:24,030
Speaker 0: And the GameCube one I haven't played enough, but if I did I could probably get good at it.

443
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:28,050
Speaker 1: I didn't like the GameCube one, and I remember the SNES one was the only one I played a lot.

444
00:22:28,651 --> 00:22:29,969
Speaker 0: The SNES one was good.

445
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:36,428
Speaker 0: The Game Boy One was like the perfection of the SNES one, and the N64 one was just kind of bland.

446
00:22:37,431 --> 00:22:45,910
Speaker 0: I'm worried though, because there's one track in the N64 one where you can cheat, and that track is in the DS one, so I'm hoping that they took out the cheating.

447
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:59,430
Speaker 0: It's like there's a way to do a shortcut, but it's not, like, normally the shortcuts in Mario Kart are like, look, here's a shortcut, but it's hard to take, and it's obviously hard to take, and it's semi-hidden, but not so hidden.

448
00:22:59,731 --> 00:23:04,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, like you'll see a kind of path that cuts a corner, but it's hard to see if you can actually go there.

449
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:12,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, or there'll be like a thing that you can hit, if you hit it with a mushroom, it'll obviously make you jump over a bad thing to save time, you know?

450
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:22,808
Speaker 0: But this was like, there's some hills, and if you use a mushroom on one of the hills in the right way and push a button, you can go over something you're obviously not supposed to go over.

451
00:23:23,832 --> 00:23:26,269
Speaker 0: It's kind of like a cheap trick thing.

452
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,048
Speaker 1: There have been cheaper things.

453
00:23:28,391 --> 00:23:30,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, there have been cheaper things, but I still don't like it.

454
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:33,909
Speaker 1: You know, getting off the pad, the power pad, and then getting back on?

455
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,070
Speaker 0: That's not so cheap, you're supposed to do that.

456
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:40,449
Speaker 0: No one can jump the way that game wants you to jump.

457
00:23:42,451 --> 00:23:45,330
Speaker 1: So I had a bunch of things of the day, and I had to settle on one.

458
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:47,670
Speaker 0: That's kind of weird, I didn't have really any things of the day.

459
00:23:47,951 --> 00:23:50,310
Speaker 1: Well, all my things are kind of old, and this one's kind of old too.

460
00:23:50,450 --> 00:23:51,730
Speaker 0: I had to take something from Saturday.

461
00:23:52,611 --> 00:24:05,309
Speaker 1: A good friend of mine actually put this, I think it was their away message or something, and I ended up looking at it, and apparently at some point someone made this Mario Brothers playset where you could take little sprites of Mario characters and stick them around.

462
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:06,350
Speaker 0: Like Color Forms?

463
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,088
Speaker 1: Something like that.

464
00:24:07,352 --> 00:24:07,629
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

465
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:18,049
Speaker 1: So something awful in all of its infinite glory had a semi-contest where people would make flash animations to these things.

466
00:24:18,312 --> 00:24:19,128
Speaker 0: I love it when they do that.

467
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:27,110
Speaker 1: And they range from interesting to hilarious to frighteningly disturbing.

468
00:24:28,571 --> 00:24:30,110
Speaker 0: That sounds about right for something awful.

469
00:24:30,590 --> 00:24:33,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it's definitely no Lord of the Rings on the go.

470
00:24:35,655 --> 00:24:38,528
Speaker 0: [Laughter] Denethor!

471
00:24:39,071 --> 00:24:39,605
Speaker 0: Denethor!

472
00:24:40,516 --> 00:24:40,888
Speaker 1: Potato.

473
00:24:41,671 --> 00:24:42,024
Speaker 0: Potato.

474
00:24:43,331 --> 00:24:44,909
Speaker 1: The Ford of Kings is reforged.

475
00:24:45,010 --> 00:24:46,268
Speaker 0: Or of video games.

476
00:24:47,131 --> 00:24:48,729
Speaker 1: Oh, video game characters gone bad.

477
00:24:48,955 --> 00:24:49,204
Speaker 0: Yeah.

478
00:24:52,854 --> 00:24:53,249
Speaker 0: Yeah.

479
00:24:53,832 --> 00:24:53,918
Speaker 1: Yeah.

480
00:24:54,511 --> 00:24:56,327
Speaker 1: So, uh... Oh, I'll warn you.

481
00:24:57,133 --> 00:24:58,410
Speaker 1: Some of these might be offensive.

482
00:24:59,291 --> 00:25:00,050
Speaker 0: It's something awful.

483
00:25:00,431 --> 00:25:00,624
Speaker 1: Yeah.

484
00:25:02,612 --> 00:25:05,890
Speaker 0: It's the name of the website, and it's also literal in its meaning.

485
00:25:06,535 --> 00:25:06,708
Speaker 1: Yeah.

486
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:11,510
Speaker 0: So, my thing of the day is something I saw on Saturday.

487
00:25:12,871 --> 00:25:20,790
Speaker 0: And in 1995, they were replacing Windows 3.1 with Windows 95.

488
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,390
Speaker 0: And, you know, they had a little show to show off their DirectX.

489
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:29,013
Speaker 0: You know, DirectX 1.

490
00:25:29,013 --> 00:25:36,189
Speaker 0: And at the show, they were really trying to push to the developers and to the people that Windows 95 was the platform for gaming, you know?

491
00:25:36,590 --> 00:25:40,770
Speaker 0: They even went so far as to say things like DOS was seriously screwed up for gaming.

492
00:25:41,113 --> 00:25:42,929
Speaker 0: People couldn't install games or anything.

493
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:43,730
Speaker 0: It was terrible.

494
00:25:44,250 --> 00:25:49,608
Speaker 0: They, like, put down their own old stuff in a bad way to push the Windows 95 and the DirectX.

495
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:53,770
Speaker 1: Even though, uh, we still play those DOS games and DOS emulators.

496
00:25:54,110 --> 00:25:54,201
Speaker 0: Yeah.

497
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,169
Speaker 0: But anyway, looking back, I guess it worked.

498
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:03,890
Speaker 0: I mean, DirectX and Windows, you know, got the games until today where PC gaming's gone down, but that's their own fault also, and that's not the point.

499
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,209
Speaker 0: The point is that at the show, they showed us a little video.

500
00:26:08,694 --> 00:26:10,008
Speaker 0: It was a little video of Bill Gates.

501
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:15,429
Speaker 0: A little video of Bill Gates standing in a level of doom.

502
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:16,789
Speaker 0: With a shotgun.

503
00:26:17,710 --> 00:26:18,589
Speaker 0: With demons around.

504
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:28,902
Speaker 0: And he was talking about DirectX, and like he shot a zombie at one point, and, you know, he said all this stuff that was kinda corny, and he was wearing this trench coat, and it's hilarious.

505
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:31,310
Speaker 1: This sounds utterly hilarious.

506
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:32,550
Speaker 0: You gotta watch this video.

507
00:26:32,591 --> 00:26:33,869
Speaker 1: I can't believe I never knew of this.

508
00:26:34,131 --> 00:26:44,007
Speaker 0: I didn't know of it either, because the story is that it was shown once and only once at this conference-y presentation thing with a bunch of developers, and it was never shown anywhere else.

509
00:26:44,852 --> 00:26:45,570
Speaker 1: How could we not know?

510
00:26:45,710 --> 00:26:52,370
Speaker 0: I mean, we're the kind of people who-- 'Cause it wasn't out, and now, finally, a guy, like, got it, and it got on the internet suddenly, on Saturday.

511
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:59,670
Speaker 1: Well, you know, we're probably gonna end up memorizing whatever funny bits are in it, like we have with every other-- It's not really a thing of memorizing catchphrases, this is Bill Gates here.

512
00:26:59,750 --> 00:27:01,329
Speaker 1: No, uh, COINBAG!

513
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:02,949
Speaker 0: No coinbag.

514
00:27:04,177 --> 00:27:05,350
Speaker 1: No lobster magnet.

515
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:06,410
Speaker 0: No lobster magnet.

516
00:27:06,490 --> 00:27:07,468
Speaker 1: Or Hamagagauchi.

517
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,010
Speaker 0: No, I think you have the wrong idea about this video.

518
00:27:11,892 --> 00:27:12,588
Speaker 1: I still wanna see it.

519
00:27:12,910 --> 00:27:15,869
Speaker 0: You should see it, it's hilarious, but it's not a catchy thing.

520
00:27:16,730 --> 00:27:18,829
Speaker 0: But Bill Gates with a shotgun, you'll never see that again.

521
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:28,847
Speaker 0: So today we decided to talk about, you know, all the different websites that we read, and how we read them and such, but we couldn't really think of a way to start talking about that, so bleh!

522
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,330
Speaker 1: So consider the aforementioned a segue.

523
00:27:32,013 --> 00:27:32,287
Speaker 0: Segue!

524
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,158
Speaker 0: Whoo!

525
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:42,430
Speaker 0: So, uh, let's start by talking about probably the number one website we visited for, it must be six, seven years I've been reading this website.

526
00:27:42,670 --> 00:27:43,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, uh, Slashdot?

527
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:43,929
Speaker 1: Slashdot.

528
00:27:44,130 --> 00:27:44,426
Speaker 1: Slashdot.

529
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:48,950
Speaker 0: So Slashdot is, uh, you know, I guess news for nerds.

530
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:52,549
Speaker 1: I doubt there are many people who listen to this who don't know what Slashdot is.

531
00:27:53,176 --> 00:27:53,429
Speaker 0: Yeah.

532
00:27:54,250 --> 00:28:00,408
Speaker 0: Slashdot has its problems, and it has its good points, and I still read it, but not as much as I used to.

533
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:03,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's my primary source of, uh, tech news.

534
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:11,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, but nowadays, like-- Not like tech breaking news, like, oh, something happened, but more like, here's the actual information about something that happened.

535
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:15,070
Speaker 0: But you don't actually get the actual information in the editing, edited Slashdot store.

536
00:28:15,154 --> 00:28:15,407
Speaker 0: Oh, god no.

537
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:16,609
Speaker 0: You get it in the comments.

538
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:19,509
Speaker 1: But, you know-- The comments are the only reason I read Slashdot.

539
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:24,148
Speaker 0: Yeah, and sometimes to post a comment, but I used to post comments like crazy, but now not so much.

540
00:28:24,816 --> 00:28:24,901
Speaker 1: Yeah.

541
00:28:25,751 --> 00:28:28,230
Speaker 1: Actually, I realized I haven't posted in a while.

542
00:28:28,490 --> 00:28:31,470
Speaker 1: Not since I tried my, uh, All Plus Five scan.

543
00:28:31,752 --> 00:28:32,510
Speaker 0: All Plus Five scan?

544
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,050
Speaker 0: It wasn't really a scan.

545
00:28:33,070 --> 00:28:33,750
Speaker 1: It wasn't really a scan.

546
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:34,430
Speaker 0: It was a challenge.

547
00:28:34,550 --> 00:28:40,510
Speaker 1: It was a thought experiment, because I noticed that the one thing about Slashdot is that certain kinds of posts always get plus five.

548
00:28:41,010 --> 00:28:45,670
Speaker 0: The wordy post that says the obvious thing before anyone else says it right away.

549
00:28:45,670 --> 00:28:46,549
Speaker 1: But there's, like, a formula.

550
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:56,328
Speaker 1: It's like, you start out by saying something obvious, then you expound on it, then you say something a little funny, and then you say something a little profound, then you say something a little funny again.

551
00:28:57,430 --> 00:29:03,469
Speaker 1: So I decided that I was going to try to fill my history, my little comments thing, with nothing but plus fives.

552
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:05,570
Speaker 0: You gotta post early, though.

553
00:29:05,691 --> 00:29:06,069
Speaker 0: That's the trick.

554
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to post within the first forty comments, or the odds of getting a plus five drop precipitously.

555
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one will see it, so no one will mod it up.

556
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,430
Speaker 1: And I did, at one point, get nothing but plus fives.

557
00:29:17,510 --> 00:29:29,227
Speaker 1: I had, like, nineteen in a row, and then I stopped caring, because the problem with doing this was so many times I'd see something, and I'd want to reply to it, like, "That guy's dumb, I have to put him in his place," or, "I know something funny about this,".

558
00:29:29,629 --> 00:29:32,266
Speaker 1: but I'd always think, "But will that get a plus

559
00:29:32,306 --> 00:29:32,689
Speaker 1: five?".

560
00:29:34,031 --> 00:29:38,270
Speaker 0: See, now here's the thing, if everyone on Slashdot thought that way, that would be great.

561
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:42,630
Speaker 0: Slashdot would be, like, this awesome haven of, like, awesome, awesome posting.

562
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:44,046
Speaker 1: There wouldn't be any more, uh, GNA!

563
00:29:46,332 --> 00:29:48,808
Speaker 0: There wouldn't be any more old Koreans, or...

564
00:29:49,231 --> 00:29:52,070
Speaker 1: In Soviet Old Korea, Russians use email?

565
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:52,816
Speaker 0: Yeah.

566
00:29:53,711 --> 00:29:54,288
Speaker 0: None of that.

567
00:29:54,790 --> 00:29:56,350
Speaker 1: Thing is, there isn't so much of that anymore.

568
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,970
Speaker 0: It's all in the polls, and in the minuses now.

569
00:29:59,090 --> 00:30:01,129
Speaker 1: Which is fine, because when I go into the polls, I expect that.

570
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:02,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess so.

571
00:30:02,770 --> 00:30:04,190
Speaker 0: But the poll hasn't updated, really.

572
00:30:04,230 --> 00:30:05,850
Speaker 0: They're getting kind of lax on Slashdot.

573
00:30:06,591 --> 00:30:08,250
Speaker 0: I think they're kind of dwindling.

574
00:30:09,811 --> 00:30:16,910
Speaker 1: Uh, well, I think it's more that all the people who used to go to Slashdot for the breaking news, because for a long time Slashdot was, like, the quickest news in the world.

575
00:30:17,191 --> 00:30:21,429
Speaker 0: Well, because... There was quicker news, but you had to just go around to get it.

576
00:30:21,750 --> 00:30:27,169
Speaker 1: But now you have things like Fark and Dig, and I go to Slashdot for the comments now, but not necessarily for the news.

577
00:30:27,470 --> 00:30:33,650
Speaker 0: I think Dig might actually be hurting Slashdot, I mean... Ever since I started reading Dig, I kind of go to Slashdot even less.

578
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:34,420
Speaker 0: Yeah.

579
00:30:34,970 --> 00:30:41,369
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like, everything from Slashdot, all the same news, but without the bad parts of Slashdot.

580
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:46,169
Speaker 0: And there's still comments, but they're not, you know, they're not huge comments, like, on Slashdot.

581
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,170
Speaker 0: They're just little tiny, blog-type comments.

582
00:30:48,191 --> 00:30:48,810
Speaker 1: See, that's the thing.

583
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:56,544
Speaker 1: The one thing Slashdot really has that I like is whenever there's a story that's kind of vague, or a story that may be misleading, or a story.

584
00:30:56,564 --> 00:31:01,507
Speaker 1: that's outright wrong, almost right away someone posts to the effect of, "Alright, here's the real

585
00:31:01,548 --> 00:31:01,749
Speaker 1: deal.".

586
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:05,769
Speaker 1: And by reading the comments, I can usually find out what's actually going on.

587
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, Dig doesn't have that so much, because the comments are kind of weak.

588
00:31:09,271 --> 00:31:17,949
Speaker 0: But what it does have is the quality stories with quality descriptions with speed, and you can tell how good the story is by how many digs it has.

589
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:21,810
Speaker 0: So the stories with like 2,000 digs, those are the hot topics.

590
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:27,530
Speaker 0: On Slashdot, you can't tell one story from the other except by the number of comments, which isn't as good as--.

591
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:34,509
Speaker 1: Well, the problem is that the number of comments is always either almost none, about 100, or a crazy number.

592
00:31:34,872 --> 00:31:34,959
Speaker 0: Yeah.

593
00:31:35,991 --> 00:31:40,130
Speaker 0: It, with the number of digs, you can really tell what the big news is, you know?

594
00:31:40,691 --> 00:31:47,850
Speaker 0: Like, I often, someone will think that something's a huge story, and I won't think it's a huge story, but then I'll find out I was wrong, or they were wrong.

595
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:49,730
Speaker 0: Dig, there's no question.

596
00:31:50,131 --> 00:31:52,850
Speaker 0: That has 2,000 digs, that's huge freakin' news.

597
00:31:53,292 --> 00:31:55,950
Speaker 0: That has 80 digs, that's a normal whatever story.

598
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:56,303
Speaker 1: Yup.

599
00:31:56,892 --> 00:31:57,070
Speaker 0: You know?

600
00:31:58,053 --> 00:31:59,450
Speaker 0: And it's just pretty awesome.

601
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:10,008
Speaker 1: Of course, the sister site, not really a sister site, but the sister site in terms of the two major sites I read every day, Fark-- I don't read Fark.

602
00:32:10,471 --> 00:32:12,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's probably better that you don't.

603
00:32:12,876 --> 00:32:13,107
Speaker 0: Yeah.

604
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:18,650
Speaker 1: Fark is, I mean, Fark has an RSS feed, but Fark basically just is an RSS feed.

605
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:29,210
Speaker 1: It's just, articles appear with funny headlines, and the comments are just this no man's land of stupid, funny, inside, oh really, yeah, really jokes.

606
00:32:29,793 --> 00:32:30,110
Speaker 0: Oh really?

607
00:32:30,331 --> 00:32:30,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, really.

608
00:32:34,492 --> 00:32:36,050
Speaker 0: We made that whole really joke.

609
00:32:36,310 --> 00:32:37,548
Speaker 1: We're using the internets.

610
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,310
Speaker 0: Making oh really jokes.

611
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:39,607
Speaker 0: All right.

612
00:32:40,052 --> 00:32:51,390
Speaker 1: I got a question out to our listeners, and I hope I don't sound ignorant, but you know the ha ha guy, I assume you all know the ha ha guy, it's this picture of this Quaker, and the text says ha ha, I'm using the internet.

613
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:56,550
Speaker 1: And then there are variations like ha ha, oh really, yeah really, or whatever.

614
00:32:57,552 --> 00:32:58,769
Speaker 1: Where did that Quaker guy come from?

615
00:32:59,011 --> 00:33:00,290
Speaker 0: No one knows where the Quaker guy came from.

616
00:33:00,310 --> 00:33:01,170
Speaker 1: I can't find it anywhere.

617
00:33:01,731 --> 00:33:05,170
Speaker 1: The earliest one I find is the ha ha guy making an internet joke.

618
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:07,710
Speaker 0: That's it, there is an internet, no one knows.

619
00:33:07,830 --> 00:33:12,027
Speaker 1: That's like the only meme out there that I can't find the origin of, and it's really bothering me.

620
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:13,929
Speaker 0: Maybe the Wikipedia knows.

621
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,310
Speaker 1: Ah, I looked, and I didn't really find anything.

622
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:18,670
Speaker 1: Wikipedia had an origin of everything else.

623
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:19,910
Speaker 0: There must be a meme of Wikipedia.

624
00:33:20,571 --> 00:33:25,910
Speaker 1: In fact, there is a Wikipedia page dedicated specifically to the YTMND fad culture.

625
00:33:26,991 --> 00:33:34,329
Speaker 0: You know, I didn't even know what YTMND was, but I saw YTMNDs, and then I discovered YTMND, and now it's just bleh.

626
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:40,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was funny back when we saw one and we didn't know what it was, and we couldn't fathom why someone would make a website like that.

627
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:42,770
Speaker 0: The first and best one that I ever saw.

628
00:33:43,551 --> 00:33:43,737
Speaker 0: Pi-May.

629
00:33:44,311 --> 00:33:45,769
Speaker 1: Pi-May stole your eyeball.

630
00:33:46,435 --> 00:33:46,988
Speaker 0: Oh no.

631
00:33:49,801 --> 00:34:00,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Fark, honestly, other than Drudge, is probably the most breaking news site in terms of, if there's big news in the world, it'll be on Fark right away.

632
00:34:01,381 --> 00:34:04,100
Speaker 0: And if there's hilarious news in the world, it'll be on Fark right away.

633
00:34:04,601 --> 00:34:10,739
Speaker 1: See, the scary thing is, Fark is used, Fark is the primary resource of almost every radio show in America.

634
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:18,899
Speaker 1: I mean, read Fark one day, and listen to some morning zoo show, like Opus and Someone, or blah blah blah, and his crew.

635
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:25,038
Speaker 1: And they just read Fark word for word, and then they make jokes that are exactly the jokes made in the comments on Fark.

636
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:40,060
Speaker 0: I'm sure some of them realize they're just doing Fark, but there's some that don't even know, like the producer would just be like, send them a printout of a webpage with a story on it, and all that guy does is go to Fark and print out like ten funny stories.

637
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:43,780
Speaker 1: I mean, if my job were to find funny things on the internet, I'd just troll Fark all day.

638
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:48,754
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so the guy does, because Fark is funny news stories that anyone will laugh at.

639
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:58,280
Speaker 0: So the guy, the producers of radio shows, just print out stories from Fark, hand them to the DJs, DJs in the morning read them, people laugh and think the show's great.

640
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:03,856
Speaker 0: Because if you listen to a morning radio show, you don't read the internet, you don't read Fark.

641
00:35:05,662 --> 00:35:08,719
Speaker 0: If you did, you would realize, and you would just read Fark.

642
00:35:11,063 --> 00:35:17,979
Speaker 1: The one contribution Fark seems to really make to the internet is that this is where all those meme-type things seem to breed.

643
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,400
Speaker 1: It's like a little primordial soup of memes and stupid things.

644
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:29,200
Speaker 0: No, because if you look way back, like, you know, sure there might have been an all-year base on Fark at some point, but it didn't breed on Fark.

645
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,498
Speaker 1: No, I'm talking in recent days.

646
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:33,720
Speaker 0: Well, but those things mostly stay on Fark.

647
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,219
Speaker 0: You don't see the "haha" and the "oh really" going anywhere else.

648
00:35:36,781 --> 00:35:40,500
Speaker 1: Actually, what's scary is I'm starting to see them more and more on Slashdot.

649
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,300
Speaker 0: Because Slashdot doesn't like to post pictures, so that really cuts it down.

650
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but very often someone still posts something to the effect of "oh really?

651
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:48,604
Speaker 1: Haha.".

652
00:35:49,162 --> 00:35:50,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, they get modded way down, though.

653
00:35:50,760 --> 00:35:52,019
Speaker 0: Fark doesn't have the modding so much.

654
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, well see, I read at way low moderation.

655
00:35:55,162 --> 00:35:57,880
Speaker 0: Oh no, I got like, if you're less than plus two, forget you.

656
00:35:58,101 --> 00:35:58,737
Speaker 1: I read at zero.

657
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,740
Speaker 1: I don't read at negative one, but I read at zero.

658
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,059
Speaker 0: Zero is scary stuff.

659
00:36:04,743 --> 00:36:04,829
Speaker 1: Yeah.

660
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:06,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, what can I say?

661
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:09,516
Speaker 1: I don't, see, negative one is all the GNAA, ahhh.

662
00:36:10,781 --> 00:36:11,838
Speaker 0: I don't get the GNAA.

663
00:36:13,423 --> 00:36:15,660
Speaker 1: I found it funny the first time I saw it.

664
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:16,456
Speaker 0: I even know what it is.

665
00:36:17,042 --> 00:36:18,159
Speaker 0: I just see people typing it.

666
00:36:18,883 --> 00:36:19,718
Speaker 1: You know what it stands for?

667
00:36:19,940 --> 00:36:20,138
Speaker 1: What?

668
00:36:20,741 --> 00:36:21,540
Speaker 0: It stands for something?

669
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,180
Speaker 0: It's not just a noise-gnaw?

670
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:28,800
Speaker 1: Basically what it is, is it's called the Gay Nigger Alliance.

671
00:36:30,341 --> 00:36:34,170
Speaker 1: And all it is, is this troll-ish, like.

672
00:36:34,271 --> 00:36:39,079
Speaker 1: it's so stupid, it's silly, and it's almost kind of funny, but not really.

673
00:36:40,161 --> 00:36:49,699
Speaker 1: And it's just this long text thing that repeats itself often, and the trolls just post it verbatim over and over and over and over again.

674
00:36:51,341 --> 00:36:55,240
Speaker 1: Like, the trolling on Slashdot isn't even, it's not trolling, it's crap flooding.

675
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,680
Speaker 1: Because trolls try to get a rise out of someone.

676
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,420
Speaker 1: The Slashdot people, no one sees their posts.

677
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,720
Speaker 1: They just do it anyway.

678
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:04,659
Speaker 0: Maybe they have an automatic thing that just does it.

679
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:08,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Slashdot blocks netblocks, and they do a lot of things to keep those people away.

680
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:09,518
Speaker 1: Those people keep at it.

681
00:37:09,845 --> 00:37:10,098
Speaker 0: Wow.

682
00:37:10,542 --> 00:37:11,138
Speaker 1: I don't know why.

683
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,237
Speaker 0: I can't fathom it.

684
00:37:12,882 --> 00:37:13,699
Speaker 0: Maybe they're just nutty.

685
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,940
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll admit, I'm often a troll on Fark.

686
00:37:17,563 --> 00:37:21,300
Speaker 1: I will often bother, I will often say things just to watch people get angry.

687
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:28,979
Speaker 1: But you can't troll Slashdot, because people are usually smart enough to be like, "Oh, he's a troll," and they mod you down, or they just don't listen to you.

688
00:37:30,521 --> 00:37:34,120
Speaker 0: Or they'll reply to you a bunch, but it'll just disappear off the front comment page.

689
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:34,370
Speaker 1: Yeah.

690
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:36,520
Speaker 1: But no one crap floods Fark.

691
00:37:36,921 --> 00:37:38,279
Speaker 1: Why do they crap flood Slashdot?

692
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:39,456
Speaker 0: I don't know.

693
00:37:40,363 --> 00:37:41,860
Speaker 0: Maybe because more people read Slashdot?

694
00:37:42,022 --> 00:37:42,377
Speaker 0: I don't know.

695
00:37:42,621 --> 00:37:44,319
Speaker 1: It's the only place I see that kind of thing.

696
00:37:44,924 --> 00:37:47,460
Speaker 0: It's because Slashdot lets you post a lot of text in your comment.

697
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:54,120
Speaker 0: Other sites, the design of the site, or the way the comments work, is not conducive to putting a huge comment.

698
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,780
Speaker 0: Slashdot, you can put a freaking essay in there.

699
00:37:57,302 --> 00:37:57,737
Speaker 0: And they do.

700
00:37:58,463 --> 00:37:58,979
Speaker 0: Many times.

701
00:37:59,260 --> 00:37:59,388
Speaker 1: Yeah.

702
00:38:01,341 --> 00:38:04,820
Speaker 0: So, what other favorite sites do we have besides news sites?

703
00:38:05,462 --> 00:38:07,080
Speaker 1: One of my favorites is always Delicious.

704
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:12,645
Speaker 0: Delicious isn't really a news site, but it's definitely one of the most useful sites there are.

705
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:15,756
Speaker 1: I mean, Delicious Popular is a good way to see, "Oh, what's new on the

706
00:38:15,776 --> 00:38:16,159
Speaker 1: internets?".

707
00:38:16,561 --> 00:38:20,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's mostly webby things, or really cool free stuff.

708
00:38:22,361 --> 00:38:28,880
Speaker 1: It's nice, because whenever I post something, because anything I'm going to talk about on this podcast, I usually just put it in my Delicious so I remember it.

709
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,680
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't know how Delicious works, and it's hard to use.

710
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:39,420
Speaker 0: That's part of what makes the popular so useful, is that only people who are smart enough to use Delicious get their stuff into the popular section.

711
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:44,239
Speaker 1: You go to Delicious, and it says what it is, but it doesn't explain exactly what to do.

712
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:53,356
Speaker 1: Which was fine, because most Slashdot-type people just figure it out, like, "Oh, slash my name tells me oh, and oh, slash tags, slash blah, oh, this is really

713
00:38:53,396 --> 00:38:53,617
Speaker 1: cool.".

714
00:38:54,984 --> 00:39:02,340
Speaker 0: I used to, back in the day, when I found a... You find the bookmark of a website, Slashdot, that you visit every day or visit really often.

715
00:39:02,821 --> 00:39:03,817
Speaker 0: You put it in your bookmarks.

716
00:39:04,520 --> 00:39:09,399
Speaker 0: But there are a whole bunch of sites where I'd want to remember the site, but just to visit it maybe once more.

717
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:13,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, or like you see a site on, like, "Oh, this is how to make Apache do this one specific

718
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:13,839
Speaker 1: thing.".

719
00:39:13,966 --> 00:39:14,219
Speaker 0: Yeah.

720
00:39:14,320 --> 00:39:15,059
Speaker 1: I'd like to remember that.

721
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:18,360
Speaker 0: And back in the day, I'd have to bookmark it or write it in a text file.

722
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:25,639
Speaker 1: I remember, I have hundreds of bookmarks in all these different folders, and every month I'd get sick of them, and I'd put them all in another folder to sort them.

723
00:39:25,907 --> 00:39:26,080
Speaker 0: Yeah.

724
00:39:26,180 --> 00:39:27,057
Speaker 1: And then I'd never sort them.

725
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:31,539
Speaker 0: And then, you know, when it comes time to look for one site that you remember, you can't find it in there.

726
00:39:31,621 --> 00:39:33,599
Speaker 1: And I'd end up searching... That was even before Google.

727
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,166
Speaker 1: I'd be like,

728
00:39:34,207 --> 00:39:34,552
Speaker 1: "Yahoo.".

729
00:39:35,181 --> 00:39:38,040
Speaker 0: So now Delicious is basically a replacement for that folder.

730
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:47,340
Speaker 0: When you find a site that's not the kind of site you visit every day, but like an article that's really interesting and you might want to see it again one day, you add it to your Delicious.

731
00:39:48,042 --> 00:39:49,460
Speaker 0: And you add tags to it.

732
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:52,040
Speaker 0: A tag is basically freeform categorization.

733
00:39:52,641 --> 00:40:02,817
Speaker 0: So if I post an article about, you know, some scientific study of farting, I'll be like, "Science, study, flatulence, poo gas,

734
00:40:03,219 --> 00:40:03,500
Speaker 0: whatever.".

735
00:40:03,621 --> 00:40:05,179
Speaker 0: Those are all separate tags.

736
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:11,219
Speaker 0: And then in the future, you know, I'll go to my Delicious, and I'll see my most recent links there right away.

737
00:40:11,841 --> 00:40:22,300
Speaker 0: But if I know that there was a story about farting, I just type in a little /farting, you know, /poo gas, look at anything that I tagged with poo gas, and there's the link.

738
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:26,120
Speaker 1: Or you can look at anything anyone else tagged with that and find related sites.

739
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:27,760
Speaker 0: And it gets really interesting.

740
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:30,060
Speaker 0: You can look for things with combinations of tags.

741
00:40:30,482 --> 00:40:33,100
Speaker 0: So you might look for something about video games.

742
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:36,220
Speaker 0: You might, someone else might put something up about music.

743
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,360
Speaker 0: If you're looking for video game music, you do video game plus music.

744
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:44,757
Speaker 0: And all of a sudden you can start to find really interesting stuff in a way that Google can't really do.

745
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:49,140
Speaker 1: That, and one thing I really find fascinating is how the tags evolve.

746
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:51,800
Speaker 1: Because there's no, like, order to the tags.

747
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:57,998
Speaker 1: You just pick whatever kind of tagging system you like, and certain tagging systems tend to rise to the top.

748
00:40:58,680 --> 00:41:01,300
Speaker 1: But I discovered that I use a lot of, like, private tags.

749
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,179
Speaker 1: Like, I have some tags that I use for me.

750
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,104
Speaker 1: Like, I have a tag,

751
00:41:06,268 --> 00:41:06,931
Speaker 1: M.W.F.,

752
00:41:07,412 --> 00:41:10,399
Speaker 1: which is just all the webcomics that update on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

753
00:41:11,243 --> 00:41:12,620
Speaker 1: And I do that to read my webcomics.

754
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:16,179
Speaker 1: And then I notice that there's some other people who did the same thing.

755
00:41:17,261 --> 00:41:27,059
Speaker 1: And whenever I find someone who uses the same kind of tagging stuff on their own that I came up with on my own, I watch Their Delicious, because they usually seem to be interested in the same kind of things I'm interested in.

756
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:29,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can do other cool things with Delicious, too.

757
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,640
Speaker 0: Like, you can tag something with the word "for" colon, F-O-R colon.

758
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:40,860
Speaker 0: So if I put a tag on a link I post, and I say "for" colon "rim," it'll send it to you in your Delicious inbox.

759
00:41:41,801 --> 00:41:56,660
Speaker 0: And it's pretty cool if a bunch of your friends use Delicious, because you can bind Deliciouses, or you can make up a tag between you, and then watch the RSS feed of that tag, you know, to like, like if you have a club, and you have a bunch of people in the club.

760
00:41:57,227 --> 00:41:57,498
Speaker 0: You know?

761
00:41:58,281 --> 00:41:58,797
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

762
00:42:00,420 --> 00:42:09,058
Speaker 1: Also, because it's open, as in, you interface with it simply by typing in URLs, like "delicious/tag/whatever,".

763
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:14,220
Speaker 1: it's real easy to write little applications that do things for you with Delicious.

764
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:16,320
Speaker 1: Real easy.

765
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:23,220
Speaker 1: Like, people who don't know anything about code can write, like, a Wget or a Bash script to get things from Delicious if they want.

766
00:42:23,662 --> 00:42:26,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of MP3 linking and all kinds of other cool stuff like that, too.

767
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:31,360
Speaker 1: Not that we condone piracy, but you can find a lot of piracy through Delicious.

768
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:33,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of non-piracy.

769
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:36,680
Speaker 0: There's a lot of just perfectly okay free songs and videos and things on there.

770
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:48,460
Speaker 1: Actually, that's what I've noticed lately, is that because the RIA and the MPA are getting so heavy and hard on piracy, the market is providing, and a lot of people are doing really cool things and not charging a dime and just putting it out there.

771
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:49,028
Speaker 0: Yep.

772
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:52,280
Speaker 0: But anyway, I think we just want to take a minute.

773
00:42:52,521 --> 00:42:58,240
Speaker 0: A lot of people don't use RSS properly or know what it is, and I think it needs to be explained.

774
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:03,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if you already know what RSS is and you use it, you can probably stop listening.

775
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:17,440
Speaker 0: So, RSS is basically, it stands for "really simple syndication," and basically, you see a website that has a bunch of stories or separate articles that are chronologically in order.

776
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:20,000
Speaker 0: Maybe like, you know, Slashdot for one.

777
00:43:20,628 --> 00:43:20,858
Speaker 0: You know?

778
00:43:21,161 --> 00:43:25,160
Speaker 1: It updates at semi-random intervals, and there's a headline and then something.

779
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:25,635
Speaker 1: Yep.

780
00:43:26,080 --> 00:43:30,900
Speaker 0: What people will do is they'll make an RSS feed, which is basically just a list of links with descriptions.

781
00:43:31,900 --> 00:43:40,320
Speaker 0: And instead of visiting Slashdot every once in a while and seeing what stories are there, you use an RSS reader of some sort to subscribe to the feed.

782
00:43:41,222 --> 00:43:44,580
Speaker 0: And you basically look in the reader, and you'll see the list of stories there.

783
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:45,879
Speaker 0: Just a list of the headlines.

784
00:43:46,481 --> 00:43:48,560
Speaker 0: And whenever there's a new headline, the list updates.

785
00:43:49,321 --> 00:44:02,978
Speaker 0: And instead of visiting websites all day, you just have this list of headlines in a program somewhere, or maybe, you know, in Firefox, you have a bookmark folder, and the bookmark in the folder keep updating throughout the day with the, you know, newest headlines labeled them.

786
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:06,240
Speaker 1: So all I do is look in my bookmarks, and hey, there's a headline I didn't notice.

787
00:44:06,721 --> 00:44:08,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, and if there's a headline you don't really care about, you don't go to it.

788
00:44:09,302 --> 00:44:09,411
Speaker 1: Yeah.

789
00:44:10,184 --> 00:44:11,580
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not great for every website.

790
00:44:11,700 --> 00:44:13,299
Speaker 1: Some sites just don't lend themselves to it.

791
00:44:14,283 --> 00:44:18,979
Speaker 0: It really, what you really want is a different kind of RSS reader for a different kind of website.

792
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:24,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, a site like Gizmodo or Engadget or Fark, you just want a list of the headlines.

793
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:25,080
Speaker 0: Yeah.

794
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:30,699
Speaker 0: And you want it in a format, like, where they're all together in one list, because it updates really frequently.

795
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:37,400
Speaker 0: You know, so you need to have something that's really efficient, you know, that you can just look at at a glance and see what's new and see what's not.

796
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,540
Speaker 0: That's something that doesn't take a lot of effort to dig through all the time.

797
00:44:41,341 --> 00:44:52,740
Speaker 0: You know, but something else, like a blog, where the guy posts maybe once a week with no set schedule, Firefox bookmarks are really great for that, because you just look in your bookmarks every once in a while and see if there's a new thing there or not.

798
00:44:53,040 --> 00:45:01,672
Speaker 1: Yep, I just make a separate folder for everything like that with all my live bookmarks in it, and I just see whenever all the various blogs and crap I read update, so I don't have to check them.

799
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:19,640
Speaker 0: The really hard ones to deal with are things like, there's one, it's kind of a podcast feed, it's hype.nonstandard.net, non-standard.net, and what it does is it goes around to blogs and it collects any links to MP3s it finds in a blog, right?

800
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:24,219
Speaker 0: Well the blogs that it has, it only checks certain blogs, but it checks a lot of them.

801
00:45:25,061 --> 00:45:29,498
Speaker 0: So you can go there at any time and it shows you the hot music people are talking about in blogs.

802
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:34,940
Speaker 0: What you want to do is you want to have a thing that downloads all the music automatically.

803
00:45:35,822 --> 00:45:36,758
Speaker 0: That's really hard to do.

804
00:45:37,681 --> 00:45:43,297
Speaker 0: And there really isn't a reader that does that properly, and it kind of makes the site not as useful as it could be.

805
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:44,932
Speaker 0: You know?

806
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:54,775
Speaker 1: I mean, RSS is still kind of an emerging technology, because as much as, I mean, it's really cool, but most people, even people who would really benefit from it, don't know about it or don't use it.

807
00:45:55,060 --> 00:46:01,560
Speaker 0: There's a lot of things people could really benefit from that they just don't know about and don't use, maybe because fear or not caring.

808
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:02,458
Speaker 1: Or just not knowing.

809
00:46:02,782 --> 00:46:03,399
Speaker 0: Or not knowing.

810
00:46:03,541 --> 00:46:08,576
Speaker 1: I mean, if no one tells you about it, and you don't stumble upon it, you're not going to learn about it.

811
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:09,049
Speaker 0: Yeah.

812
00:46:09,580 --> 00:46:15,340
Speaker 0: But it's like, people don't even, like, you know, something stinks, like, it takes me forever to read all these websites.

813
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:17,635
Speaker 0: They don't even, and they say, "I wish there was something,".

814
00:46:17,695 --> 00:46:18,280
Speaker 0: they don't even look.

815
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,597
Speaker 0: For two seconds you'd be like, "Hey, what are those orange things I see on all the

816
00:46:21,617 --> 00:46:22,059
Speaker 0: websites?".

817
00:46:22,890 --> 00:46:23,159
Speaker 0: You know?

818
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:23,908
Speaker 0: "I wonder what those

819
00:46:23,969 --> 00:46:24,212
Speaker 0: mean.".

820
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:27,571
Speaker 0: You know, how many people who don't use Firefox?

821
00:46:27,631 --> 00:46:29,500
Speaker 0: that would make their lives a thousand times better?

822
00:46:29,981 --> 00:46:30,299
Speaker 1: Yeah.

823
00:46:30,802 --> 00:46:31,056
Speaker 1: Yeah.

824
00:46:31,563 --> 00:46:34,299
Speaker 0: Believe it or not, there are people out there who see pop-up ads.

825
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:35,305
Speaker 1: Ah!

826
00:46:35,982 --> 00:46:36,109
Speaker 1: Ah!

827
00:46:37,755 --> 00:46:37,859
Speaker 1: Ah!

828
00:46:38,871 --> 00:46:39,138
Speaker 1: Oh, God!

829
00:46:39,621 --> 00:46:40,060
Speaker 1: The goggles!

830
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:40,940
Speaker 1: They do nothing!

831
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:49,840
Speaker 1: And that was Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

832
