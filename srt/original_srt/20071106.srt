1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,145
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, November 6th.

2
00:00:11,527 --> 00:00:12,048
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:16,763
Speaker 1: Scott walked away before we did the opener and this is geek night Tonight.

4
00:00:16,804 --> 00:00:20,020
Speaker 1: what we would do if we had a dev kit for anything Nintendo?

5
00:00:24,371 --> 00:00:32,595
Speaker 1: Let's do this man, so, uh Still haven't played any more Bioshock.

6
00:00:33,622 --> 00:00:40,440
Speaker 1: The news is the new Zelda game is still sitting on the compressor where I said it after Scott handed it to me.

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:41,988
Speaker 0: Why don't you play it on the train or something?

8
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:49,391
Speaker 1: Cuz I do other things on the train and play Reading Temeraire book for Empire of ivory worse.

9
00:00:49,672 --> 00:00:51,036
Speaker 0: I shouldn't take you more than a couple days.

10
00:00:51,297 --> 00:00:52,280
Speaker 1: Actually, I just finished it.

11
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,044
Speaker 1: Okay, so you two days of reading.

12
00:00:54,064 --> 00:01:02,480
Speaker 1: so you can play link now because now I have to read the terror which is also Nautical fiction that involves some element of fantasy and/or the supernatural possible.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,142
Speaker 0: Wait a minute.

14
00:01:03,282 --> 00:01:07,715
Speaker 0: that Zelda game is nautical fiction that involves some element of the supernatural.

15
00:01:07,975 --> 00:01:09,058
Speaker 0: So you should play that.

16
00:01:09,279 --> 00:01:20,880
Speaker 1: All right if Link will hem and ha internally to himself while ordering men to their deaths in a valiant fight for British safety and security.

17
00:01:22,002 --> 00:01:29,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, something similar happens with Gorons, maybe Does link cheat on ever increasingly beautiful and distant women?

18
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,060
Speaker 1: Until eventually he cheats on the woman he loves the most with the woman he loves even more but she dies.

19
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,345
Speaker 1: So he ends up with the first woman.

20
00:01:36,526 --> 00:01:37,852
Speaker 1: he and all the other women die.

21
00:01:37,872 --> 00:01:39,599
Speaker 0: He cheats at money-making game.

22
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:53,178
Speaker 1: Yeah No, I haven't played a lot of Guitar Hero 3 and now that I've played a little more and I think Scott can agree I have a few things to say about it.

23
00:01:53,600 --> 00:02:03,171
Speaker 0: Well, we got the Wii version and I think the first thing that's obvious is the Wii guitars the best guitar ever the best guitars The best plastic guitar even though remember we talked about.

24
00:02:03,232 --> 00:02:07,386
Speaker 1: Oh, man, she play Mario with the guitar When they.

25
00:02:07,588 --> 00:02:14,800
Speaker 1: I don't know how they did it But when they made the Wii guitar they didn't make it right, you know that there's a little nipple right the little analog stick.

26
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:18,480
Speaker 1: It goes right by your breast and you can move around and bring it to Guitar Hero.

27
00:02:18,561 --> 00:02:21,080
Speaker 1: So you don't have to have an extra controller out to play Guitar Hero.

28
00:02:22,700 --> 00:02:30,666
Speaker 1: You cannot use the guitar in any other capacity because you have a 90% chance of crashing the Wii Every time you do.

29
00:02:30,686 --> 00:02:33,558
Speaker 0: you know when you turn on a Wii game that needs the nunchuck and you have that.

30
00:02:33,658 --> 00:02:38,188
Speaker 0: if you don't have The nunchuck plugged in it says hey put in the nunchuck, you know You play another game where you don't need the nunchuck.

31
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:39,935
Speaker 0: It'll say hey take out the nunchuck.

32
00:02:39,956 --> 00:02:40,980
Speaker 0: what is wrong with you, right?

33
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:43,086
Speaker 1: And even then it still works.

34
00:02:43,146 --> 00:02:50,640
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but I would assume that you know, if you started up a game, you know Some games they say, you know, I will not let you play unless you plug in the classic controller.

35
00:02:50,802 --> 00:02:56,940
Speaker 0: You need it, you know stuff like that If you have the guitar plugged in or not that we doesn't recognize the guitar at all.

36
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,395
Speaker 0: It has no clue and it's like you could just start up games that don't need the guitar and then it'll.

37
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:09,400
Speaker 1: you can crash the Or not even that the Wii menu stuff if you can click on green with that little nipple to start guitar hero.

38
00:03:09,982 --> 00:03:16,320
Speaker 1: But do not under any circumstances use that green button to open any other menu on the Wii.

39
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:22,058
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if you try to go into like the Weather Channel with the guitar It's not gonna do it end.

40
00:03:22,078 --> 00:03:24,405
Speaker 1: Well Yeah, there's issues with that.

41
00:03:24,846 --> 00:03:34,437
Speaker 1: Also, I tried out the WFC, you know playing on the Wii Wi-Fi and Once again, Nintendo has shown me that their wireless offerings are laughable and worthless.

42
00:03:34,759 --> 00:03:35,100
Speaker 0: pretty much.

43
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

44
00:03:36,545 --> 00:03:43,338
Speaker 0: the only thing it does that has any value is show everyone scores online Which doesn't have much value because I really couldn't care with that's.

45
00:03:43,418 --> 00:03:43,660
Speaker 0: you know.

46
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:47,620
Speaker 0: I know someone else out there can beat the whole game on expert with five stars in every song.

47
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,277
Speaker 1: I don't need you to show me the versus playing is just even in person.

48
00:03:51,318 --> 00:03:53,502
Speaker 1: It's just so Uninspired.

49
00:03:53,522 --> 00:03:53,582
Speaker 1: Yep.

50
00:03:54,265 --> 00:03:58,179
Speaker 0: We have yet to play the co-op career mode though, which is where I think the action is.

51
00:03:59,321 --> 00:04:11,519
Speaker 1: If only someone who may be was throwing a party sometime in the near future would buy another guitar hero 3 for the Wii Yes, then perhaps we could bring because yet they do not sell these spare guitars, which I guess we'll buy one.

52
00:04:12,009 --> 00:04:12,380
Speaker 0: But yeah.

53
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:20,380
Speaker 1: And there's a bunch of issues with Menus and the menus just aren't as good and I'm every now and then I run into trouble trying to navigate around the game.

54
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:26,540
Speaker 0: Yep, but in general, I think the only thing to say about the game itself is that it's guitar hero.

55
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:29,258
Speaker 0: It's just as guitar hero as the other two.

56
00:04:30,042 --> 00:04:40,880
Speaker 0: But and you know in most rhythm games that you know, the selection of songs is like varied, you know You got some super awesome hardcore songs some long songs some short songs some fun some not so fun, right?

57
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,672
Speaker 0: This one seems to have all the same kind of song.

58
00:04:44,692 --> 00:04:46,860
Speaker 0: I mean sure the songs are really awesome.

59
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:49,110
Speaker 0: It's got like ten awesome songs.

60
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:55,213
Speaker 0: Yes, that song is it's freaking roots Yeah, but it's not like guitar hero 2 or like.

61
00:04:55,233 --> 00:05:02,295
Speaker 0: you had some songs that were like dinner and some that were like You know just fun in some way doesn't have a lot of those.

62
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:07,351
Speaker 0: the variety in Gameplay style across songs is not as wide.

63
00:05:07,371 --> 00:05:13,273
Speaker 1: I think a part of the problem is that classic rock-metal Tends to be kind of repetitive except for the solos.

64
00:05:13,594 --> 00:05:14,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, really repetitive.

65
00:05:15,421 --> 00:05:20,859
Speaker 1: How many songs are two minutes of me going chaga chaga chaga chaga chaga chaga chaga?

66
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,808
Speaker 1: To finally get to and then fail on the solo.

67
00:05:23,988 --> 00:05:27,217
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like jigga jigga jigga jigga jigga jigga jigga jigga jigga jigga jigga jigga.

68
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,441
Speaker 0: Fail.

69
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,124
Speaker 0: it's like yeah.

70
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:34,924
Speaker 0: Why don't I even bother?

71
00:05:35,245 --> 00:05:46,023
Speaker 1: I think the real problem because actually us and Alex argued long into the night over the weekend about how dissatisfied we are with pretty much all gaming since Portal came out Kind of.

72
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:47,711
Speaker 0: I'm not too dissatisfied.

73
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,378
Speaker 0: I'm liking my Phoenix Wright 3.

74
00:05:49,378 --> 00:05:49,740
Speaker 0: I'm playing.

75
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,504
Speaker 1: Oh, of course.

76
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:52,920
Speaker 1: I'll play it probably immediately after you finish it.

77
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,743
Speaker 0: You didn't beat Phoenix Wright 2.

78
00:05:54,743 --> 00:05:56,979
Speaker 1: I kind of stopped caring in the middle of the circus one.

79
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:01,720
Speaker 0: Well, you know, the one after that is... I don't know if... Yeah, that's not the last one.

80
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,919
Speaker 0: So the one after the last one is good.

81
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I got to get through that stupid circus one that I just stopped caring about.

82
00:06:08,283 --> 00:06:08,878
Speaker 1: I guess I could.

83
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:14,079
Speaker 0: Just tell... There's facts online that are just like, "Present this on this line of text.

84
00:06:14,119 --> 00:06:16,137
Speaker 0: Do this, do this, do this, exact the shortest way through the

85
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:16,379
Speaker 0: game.".

86
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:16,723
Speaker 1: I don't know.

87
00:06:16,743 --> 00:06:18,059
Speaker 1: I'd feel kind of dirty doing that.

88
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:25,000
Speaker 0: Well, you know, if you're being bored... Phoenix Wright, the way I look at it, is not so much a video game, even though it's technically a video game.

89
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:29,140
Speaker 0: It's basically a manga with a little bit of animation and music on it, right?

90
00:06:29,481 --> 00:06:34,760
Speaker 0: And the only difference is that you sort of have to... You know, you get to solve cute little puzzles to read the next chapter of the manga.

91
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:44,775
Speaker 0: And, you know, compared to the other Phoenix Wrights, actually this third one... I guess the translation group, I think, did a much better job in that they threw in a lot of jokes.

92
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:47,220
Speaker 0: You know, they did their usual throwing in of jokes.

93
00:06:48,581 --> 00:06:52,379
Speaker 0: But, it's much, like, the thing that I think is obvious, the right answer, like, works.

94
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,036
Speaker 0: I've only run into, like, two or three parts where I was like, "What the

95
00:06:56,077 --> 00:06:56,298
Speaker 0: fuck?".

96
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:58,979
Speaker 0: Unlike the first and second ones, there were a lot of what the fucks.

97
00:07:00,241 --> 00:07:00,532
Speaker 0: I don't know.

98
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:03,740
Speaker 0: If you like Phoenix Wright, you still like Phoenix Wright.

99
00:07:04,061 --> 00:07:07,160
Speaker 0: There's a third one out, you should get it, and then they'll bring out the fourth one.

100
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:09,840
Speaker 0: If you don't get the third one, you won't see the fourth one.

101
00:07:10,302 --> 00:07:23,579
Speaker 1: Though, speaking of being dissatisfied with gaming, I do have to point out that, despite the fact that I'm almost entirely jaded with all this stuff now, something remarkable happened, something that I've been waiting for for a long time.

102
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,720
Speaker 1: Mario 3, Virtual Console.

103
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:27,886
Speaker 0: Yep, I bought it.

104
00:07:28,168 --> 00:07:28,652
Speaker 0: I'm playing it.

105
00:07:28,934 --> 00:07:30,000
Speaker 0: It's Mario 3.

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:37,039
Speaker 1: Now, people have argued whether or not Mario 3 is either the best selling video game in the history of gaming, or the second best.

107
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:45,160
Speaker 0: Because it's kind of close, even though-- Well, you got close to ones like SimCity or The Sims, you know, stuff like that is hot on the heels there.

108
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:54,580
Speaker 1: But at the same time, it was just released for the Virtual Console, and it sold, from what I can gather, quite well.

109
00:07:55,220 --> 00:08:01,011
Speaker 1: I'm fairly certain that, as of now or next week, it won't be disputing anymore.

110
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:02,420
Speaker 1: It will have been the best selling game ever.

111
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:03,150
Speaker 0: Yep.

112
00:08:04,162 --> 00:08:07,680
Speaker 1: And, uh, the last thing I should say is that that is entirely justified.

113
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:10,899
Speaker 1: Mario 3 is, like, one of the best video games ever made.

114
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:16,286
Speaker 0: According to Wikipedia here, which I think is wrong, they're counting Super Mario Bros.

115
00:08:16,286 --> 00:08:17,771
Speaker 0: 1 as 40.23 million, and Super Mario Bros.

116
00:08:17,771 --> 00:08:18,313
Speaker 0: 3 is 18 million.

117
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,675
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's fair to count Mario 1 as 40 million.

118
00:08:23,902 --> 00:08:25,318
Speaker 1: Mario 1 came with the NES!

119
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:26,642
Speaker 0: Yeah.

120
00:08:26,662 --> 00:08:32,638
Speaker 0: I mean, basically, the reason Mario 3 is the biggest selling is because, when it came out, everyone had an NES.

121
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,020
Speaker 0: You know, quote everyone.

122
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,539
Speaker 0: And pretty much for every NES, a Mario 3 was sold.

123
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:41,760
Speaker 0: I mean, there wasn't anyone who didn't have Mario 3 who had an NES.

124
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,620
Speaker 0: Basically nobody.

125
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:48,647
Speaker 0: So that's why, I mean, even the Halo, which sells a bajillion bajillion, doesn't sell one for a 360.

126
00:08:48,647 --> 00:08:51,321
Speaker 0: It sells, like, one for every third 360.

127
00:08:51,321 --> 00:09:08,620
Speaker 1: Well, remember, when Mario 3 came out, that was an era when Nintendo was facing antitrust suits for being a gigantic evil monopoly, and they funded, not a TV commercial, I mean, ah, TV commercial, they made a whole movie in theaters with real actors.

128
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:12,422
Speaker 1: that was nothing more than a commercial for Super Mario 3.

129
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:12,736
Speaker 0: It worked.

130
00:09:13,682 --> 00:09:15,580
Speaker 1: I saw that movie in the theater on opening day.

131
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,840
Speaker 0: I saw that movie in the theater with my grandma.

132
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:20,035
Speaker 1: It was so bad.

133
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,780
Speaker 1: As a result, I knew exactly where that fucking warp whistle was.

134
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:25,870
Speaker 0: I knew one of them.

135
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:26,740
Speaker 0: I got the other ones.

136
00:09:27,021 --> 00:09:32,683
Speaker 0: I remember there were TV shows about how to, like, do secret stuff in Mario 3.

137
00:09:32,683 --> 00:09:33,600
Speaker 1: Ah, good times.

138
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, like on network television there was a guy showing secrets of Mario 3.

139
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:40,479
Speaker 1: But seriously, if you've never played Mario 3 and you own a Wii, buy it.

140
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,578
Speaker 1: This is gaming history right here.

141
00:09:43,662 --> 00:09:45,800
Speaker 1: I'll warn ya, game's a little hard.

142
00:09:46,162 --> 00:09:47,258
Speaker 0: Best platformer ever, maybe?

143
00:09:47,723 --> 00:09:48,157
Speaker 1: Might be.

144
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:51,659
Speaker 0: Man, it'd be so cool to play it, though, without knowing all the stuff I know.

145
00:09:52,923 --> 00:09:54,879
Speaker 1: There was a time when I was able to do that.

146
00:09:55,321 --> 00:10:00,160
Speaker 1: A long time ago, when I also was able to enjoy a movie that was an ad for a video game.

147
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:07,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, the only other things I gotta say right now are that I have three games, well, four games currently pre-ordered for the Wii alone.

148
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,820
Speaker 0: And so if anyone says there's still a Wii drought, you're wrong.

149
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,280
Speaker 0: You ready for the four games I got pre-ordered?

150
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:12,479
Speaker 1: You can't pre-order four games.

151
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,163
Speaker 0: Oh, I did.

152
00:10:13,244 --> 00:10:15,420
Speaker 0: In fact, I think one of them might already be out.

153
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,220
Speaker 0: I got, of course, the Smash Brothers, which is coming in the February, pre-ordered.

154
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,040
Speaker 0: Mario Galaxy coming in a couple weeks, or a week or two, pre-ordered.

155
00:10:23,221 --> 00:10:24,226
Speaker 1: I've seen some buzz.

156
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:26,680
Speaker 1: Everyone seems to say good things about it.

157
00:10:27,702 --> 00:10:29,080
Speaker 0: Everyone's saying amazing things about it.

158
00:10:29,762 --> 00:10:33,800
Speaker 0: I've been avoiding the videos, but I've seen enough to know that I can't go wrong.

159
00:10:34,522 --> 00:10:38,183
Speaker 0: It might be the second coming of Mario 3.

160
00:10:38,183 --> 00:10:40,660
Speaker 0: I got the Trauma Center New Blood pre-ordered.

161
00:10:41,021 --> 00:10:45,380
Speaker 0: And while the other Trauma Centers were only decent, this one has co-op mode.

162
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:46,645
Speaker 0: So if R.I.M.

163
00:10:46,745 --> 00:10:50,997
Speaker 0: actually bothers to build up his skill at playing that game, it would be worth the co-op mode.

164
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:53,500
Speaker 1: I beat Mario 64.

165
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,239
Speaker 0: I'm talking about Trauma Center.

166
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:55,106
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

167
00:10:55,309 --> 00:10:56,039
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna play that.

168
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:56,599
Speaker 0: You suck.

169
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:58,275
Speaker 1: I didn't enjoy the first one.

170
00:10:58,437 --> 00:10:58,760
Speaker 1: At all.

171
00:10:59,201 --> 00:10:59,900
Speaker 0: But it's co-op Trauma Center.

172
00:11:00,944 --> 00:11:02,496
Speaker 1: I really didn't enjoy Trauma Center.

173
00:11:02,537 --> 00:11:02,920
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

174
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,653
Speaker 1: I played it on the DS a little bit.

175
00:11:04,693 --> 00:11:05,339
Speaker 1: It wasn't fun.

176
00:11:06,243 --> 00:11:07,299
Speaker 1: I started to play it on a Wii.

177
00:11:08,342 --> 00:11:11,900
Speaker 1: I stopped caring and went back to playing Mario 64.

178
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:12,428
Speaker 0: Well, you suck.

179
00:11:13,016 --> 00:11:13,300
Speaker 0: Anyway.

180
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,340
Speaker 1: And fanatical devotion to the Pope.

181
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:15,783
Speaker 1: Right.

182
00:11:15,824 --> 00:11:17,420
Speaker 0: And the last game that I have pre-ordered.

183
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,815
Speaker 0: Actually, I think it might have been in order.

184
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:19,300
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

185
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:21,198
Speaker 0: It might have been released tomorrow, maybe.

186
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,280
Speaker 0: Is... Lego Star Wars Complete Saga.

187
00:11:25,024 --> 00:11:25,320
Speaker 1: For the Wii.

188
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:26,780
Speaker 1: Those games are cute.

189
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:27,462
Speaker 0: Yeah.

190
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:30,600
Speaker 0: I got the feeling that this one is gonna be worth it.

191
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:31,784
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

192
00:11:31,845 --> 00:11:33,500
Speaker 1: I also gotta point out just one more time.

193
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,660
Speaker 1: All indications are that the new Worms game for the DS is awesome.

194
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,619
Speaker 1: And you should buy it.

195
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:39,043
Speaker 0: I don't know.

196
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:41,460
Speaker 0: I wouldn't say it's awesome, but it's worth buying.

197
00:11:41,581 --> 00:11:44,119
Speaker 1: It is not up to the potential of what a game like that could be.

198
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:51,410
Speaker 1: But compared to the previous Worms game, and also for saying- Solid gold idea, right?

199
00:11:51,471 --> 00:11:51,813
Speaker 0: Perfect.

200
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,799
Speaker 0: That could be great, right?

201
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:56,040
Speaker 0: But the first time they tried that, it didn't work so well.

202
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:59,336
Speaker 0: So now they have Worms DS2, which is better.

203
00:11:59,637 --> 00:12:00,160
Speaker 0: Significantly.

204
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:08,480
Speaker 1: But two, it seems like one of those games like Bomberman where, if your friends all play it together, it kind of transcends what it actually is and becomes something wonderful.

205
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:08,961
Speaker 1: Yep.

206
00:12:09,465 --> 00:12:11,160
Speaker 0: It's not a game you're gonna play alone, that's for sure.

207
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:11,582
Speaker 0: No.

208
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:17,239
Speaker 1: Even though I think the merit of practice has been shown, as Scott cannot beat Alex.

209
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,480
Speaker 0: But you're not gonna play it alone for the single player.

210
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,820
Speaker 0: You're gonna play it alone to practice.

211
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,819
Speaker 0: Then when you play the multiplayer, you'll win.

212
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:27,460
Speaker 1: But I thought modern games showed me that single player only exists to teach me how to play the multiplayer.

213
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:29,200
Speaker 0: Sometimes.

214
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:29,900
Speaker 1: Yeah.

215
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:30,980
Speaker 0: Alright.

216
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,199
Speaker 1: Alright, so what do you got?

217
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:33,153
Speaker 0: My news?

218
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:37,220
Speaker 0: It's the same news that you're gonna have every year around this time.

219
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:44,160
Speaker 0: And that is, go to www.childsplaycharity.org and empty your wallet.

220
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,609
Speaker 1: Do I need to say more?

221
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,880
Speaker 1: Do we need to bring it up?

222
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,238
Speaker 1: Do we need to even say what that is?

223
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,085
Speaker 0: Nah, I don't know.

224
00:12:49,126 --> 00:12:50,880
Speaker 0: If you don't know what that is, do what I just said.

225
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:52,519
Speaker 0: Did you buy anything yet?

226
00:12:53,122 --> 00:12:53,628
Speaker 1: I haven't yet.

227
00:12:53,668 --> 00:12:54,658
Speaker 1: I'm thinking about buying a DS.

228
00:12:55,221 --> 00:12:57,340
Speaker 0: I bought a Pokemon Emerald.

229
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:58,899
Speaker 1: That's probably a good one.

230
00:12:59,140 --> 00:12:59,229
Speaker 1: Yeah.

231
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:04,180
Speaker 0: I bought it for the closest hospital, which I think is that Montefiore, which you worked at before.

232
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to.

233
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:08,459
Speaker 1: Well, nah, I worked for a company that was a wholly owned subsidiary of that.

234
00:13:08,905 --> 00:13:09,260
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

235
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,800
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's the closest hospital geographically, so that's the one I picked.

236
00:13:13,202 --> 00:13:16,900
Speaker 0: Pretty interesting, they have a cancer hospital in Egypt now on the list.

237
00:13:16,960 --> 00:13:18,419
Speaker 0: They have a lot more hospitals than before.

238
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,640
Speaker 1: Well, because Child's Play is proving the power of webcomics and Penny Arcade.

239
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:31,740
Speaker 1: I mean, they are major players now, as far as anyone can-- In the video game industry, Penny Arcade is the be-all, end-all.

240
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:32,814
Speaker 0: Something like that.

241
00:13:34,121 --> 00:13:34,947
Speaker 0: Give up your monies.

242
00:13:35,047 --> 00:13:35,671
Speaker 0: It's pretty easy.

243
00:13:35,893 --> 00:13:36,920
Speaker 0: It just takes you to Amazon.

244
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,280
Speaker 1: It's very easy to give up money.

245
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:40,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, you go to Amazon and you buy something.

246
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,778
Speaker 0: The only difference is nothing ever comes in the mail to your house.

247
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:50,480
Speaker 1: Except the warm smiles of children who have something to do during their horrible recovery from dangerous illness.

248
00:13:51,181 --> 00:13:53,579
Speaker 0: Or I actually got a letter from the hospital last year.

249
00:13:54,002 --> 00:13:54,999
Speaker 1: Aw, I didn't get anything.

250
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,459
Speaker 0: It's because you picked the wrong hospital.

251
00:13:58,044 --> 00:13:59,780
Speaker 0: All I got was-- You picked the grumpy hospital.

252
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,840
Speaker 1: All I got was a receipt.

253
00:14:02,343 --> 00:14:03,390
Speaker 0: I can get a receipt.

254
00:14:03,451 --> 00:14:04,216
Speaker 0: I got the, you know--.

255
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:06,000
Speaker 1: Well, the Amazon receipt.

256
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Amazon receipt and my email.

257
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,040
Speaker 1: The Amazon receipt that I then used for my taxes.

258
00:14:09,161 --> 00:14:11,780
Speaker 0: But then the hospital sent me a letter in the mail.

259
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:13,000
Speaker 1: I didn't get a letter.

260
00:14:13,323 --> 00:14:14,440
Speaker 0: Pick the same hospital that I picked.

261
00:14:14,782 --> 00:14:16,000
Speaker 1: I feel kind of gipped now.

262
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,459
Speaker 1: Some kid should have written me a letter.

263
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:18,760
Speaker 0: I didn't get a letter from the kid.

264
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,239
Speaker 1: It's good for his convalescence.

265
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,820
Speaker 0: I got a letter from the hospital, not from the kid.

266
00:14:22,943 --> 00:14:23,899
Speaker 1: I should have been from the kid.

267
00:14:24,641 --> 00:14:25,078
Speaker 0: What do you want?

268
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,320
Speaker 0: The kid probably can't even write.

269
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:27,639
Speaker 0: All he can do is play Pokémon.

270
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,120
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

271
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:39,279
Speaker 1: So this was on Dig, but I can't pass it up.

272
00:14:41,081 --> 00:14:44,000
Speaker 1: Someone made a little animation, kind of South Park-y in style.

273
00:14:44,563 --> 00:14:48,060
Speaker 1: That is just all of Half-Life, as in Half-Life 1 and Half-Life 2.

274
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,658
Speaker 0: Not Episode 1 or Episode 2, though.

275
00:14:50,162 --> 00:14:50,650
Speaker 1: In 60 seconds.

276
00:14:51,421 --> 00:14:51,858
Speaker 1: And you know what?

277
00:14:52,081 --> 00:14:53,059
Speaker 1: It's exactly that.

278
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,059
Speaker 0: It reminds me a lot.

279
00:14:54,160 --> 00:15:01,255
Speaker 0: Do you remember way back, like on America's Funniest Home Videos, way back in the day, there was some guy who was like, "Casablanca in 60

280
00:15:01,255 --> 00:15:01,598
Speaker 0: seconds.".

281
00:15:01,922 --> 00:15:02,619
Speaker 0: So that was his video.

282
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:08,020
Speaker 0: And he had like this big disc with all the characters' faces on it, and he would spin it around to switch to the different characters.

283
00:15:08,822 --> 00:15:09,800
Speaker 1: No, I don't remember that.

284
00:15:09,901 --> 00:15:18,540
Speaker 1: I remember a guy who set it up so that half of him was a man and half of him was a woman down the top, and he turned sideways back and forth 180 degrees to sing two parts of a song.

285
00:15:19,101 --> 00:15:19,920
Speaker 0: Oh, that's okay.

286
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:20,331
Speaker 1: Yeah.

287
00:15:21,181 --> 00:15:22,540
Speaker 0: Anyway, that was just something I remembered.

288
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:28,000
Speaker 0: There's a lot of people who act out long things in a very short span of time.

289
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:28,919
Speaker 1: This is one of the best.

290
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:30,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a very good one.

291
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:34,320
Speaker 0: It's quite entertaining, especially if you've played Half-Life 1 and 2.

292
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,060
Speaker 1: Blah, blah, blah, Gordon Freeman.

293
00:15:36,281 --> 00:15:36,860
Speaker 0: Gordon Freeman.

294
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:37,579
Speaker 0: Gordon Freeman!

295
00:15:37,840 --> 00:15:38,160
Speaker 0: Gordon Freeman!

296
00:15:38,608 --> 00:15:39,239
Speaker 0: Gordon Freeman.

297
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:39,756
Speaker 0: Okay.

298
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,578
Speaker 0: Here's a crowbar!

299
00:15:41,742 --> 00:15:44,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not in English except for Gordon Freeman, but it doesn't matter.

300
00:15:45,362 --> 00:15:46,018
Speaker 0: No, it doesn't matter.

301
00:15:46,801 --> 00:15:48,734
Speaker 0: And if you haven't played Half-Life 1 and 2, what are you doing?

302
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,640
Speaker 1: Well, if you watch this, it's kind of a substitute.

303
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:53,100
Speaker 0: Not really, no.

304
00:15:53,927 --> 00:15:54,399
Speaker 0: Not really.

305
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:59,779
Speaker 0: In fact, while this sort of spoils by showing you the entire plot, it doesn't really spoil.

306
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:07,040
Speaker 0: I mean, it's so summaried that you could play it, and the spoiling still wouldn't happen.

307
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:16,636
Speaker 1: If anything, you'll be playing it, and then things will happen in the game, and you'll think back to this video and go, "Oh, those two scientists did fall to their deaths in that

308
00:16:16,717 --> 00:16:17,199
Speaker 1: elevator.".

309
00:16:17,461 --> 00:16:18,278
Speaker 0: Haha, they did.

310
00:16:21,025 --> 00:16:21,720
Speaker 1: Right, so what do you got?

311
00:16:22,663 --> 00:16:32,440
Speaker 0: Oh, so back in the day, some of the funny, you know, before YouTubes and stuff, you know, it was not so easy, and before Digg, it wasn't the easiest to find the funniest things on the internet consistently and in abundance.

312
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,080
Speaker 0: So you would go to sites like Something Awful, where people would get together to make funny things, all in the same spot.

313
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:41,280
Speaker 0: And thus things like Photoshop Friday or Comedy Goldmine were the hotness.

314
00:16:42,601 --> 00:16:47,240
Speaker 1: I really have to avoid suddenly going and looking at probably the best Comedy Goldmine of all time.

315
00:16:48,322 --> 00:16:49,540
Speaker 1: Lord of the Rings on the go.

316
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,255
Speaker 0: What about Video Games?

317
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:51,820
Speaker 0: Gone Bad?

318
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:52,737
Speaker 1: That's number two.

319
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,478
Speaker 1: But Lord of the Rings on the go.

320
00:16:54,700 --> 00:17:01,960
Speaker 0: Yes, well, you know, it's been a while since there's been a Photoshop Friday that I found humorous, but suddenly, one appeared.

321
00:17:02,242 --> 00:17:04,359
Speaker 0: That was the awesome, and it is Thinking with Portals.

322
00:17:04,599 --> 00:17:07,200
Speaker 0: And it's just Photoshops of, well, portals.

323
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,780
Speaker 0: And it's funny, you should look at it.

324
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:13,960
Speaker 0: There's not enough of them to suit my tastes, but the ones that are there are quality.

325
00:17:14,340 --> 00:17:17,000
Speaker 0: But I think they should have let it go on longer to make it better.

326
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:21,099
Speaker 1: I think the real problem is that it kind of starts with the funnier and goes toward the unfunny.

327
00:17:21,319 --> 00:17:25,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they should have just made the last page, you know, the shame page or whatever, but they didn't.

328
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I always liked the shame pages more than the actual Photoshops.

329
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:29,783
Speaker 0: I know, right?

330
00:17:29,863 --> 00:17:33,820
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, I hear the bad ones that don't really cut it, but they didn't do that.

331
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:36,860
Speaker 1: I know, I like the dog a lot, and the cat, and yeah.

332
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,960
Speaker 0: Yep, okay.

333
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:45,960
Speaker 1: Right, so this actually came out of the Questions show, where someone asked us what we would do if we had a Nintendo Wii dev kit.

334
00:17:46,560 --> 00:18:07,260
Speaker 0: Well, you see, the thing is, is in general, even now that the drought of DS has been long over, and the Wii drought, I can say, is over, there is still the problem that Nintendo and many other people, not just Nintendo, but Apple, and a lot of companies that make things that geeks care about, are not living up to the full potential.

335
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:20,609
Speaker 0: You know, the things that they make, say the iPhone or the Wii, are capable of so much, they're capable of getting a million points, but the companies only do like 500 points worth of work because they make just as much money.

336
00:18:20,669 --> 00:18:23,280
Speaker 0: In fact, they make more money that way because their costs are lower.

337
00:18:23,721 --> 00:18:26,168
Speaker 1: Well, it's kind of like in Guitar Hero 3.

338
00:18:26,168 --> 00:18:30,400
Speaker 1: If the lowest I can get is three stars, why am I even going to bother?

339
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:40,165
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's like, so people who are geeks like us, we look at these things and we say, "We see the full potential of that,".

340
00:18:40,205 --> 00:18:45,160
Speaker 0: and what you get is you get a hacked iPhone that can do all these things to actually unlock the full potential, you know?

341
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:52,460
Speaker 0: But the Wii and the DS, the full potential, you know, I guess sort of unlocked on the DS, those DS flash cards, but not really.

342
00:18:53,001 --> 00:19:00,460
Speaker 0: And there is, you know, it's much harder for people homebrewing to unlock the full potential of something like a Wii DS combination.

343
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:08,637
Speaker 0: So, in this show, we're just going to talk about what we think you could do to actually achieve the full potential of the DS/Wii/DS Wii.

344
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:17,100
Speaker 1: So, correct us if we're wrong, but I'm of the opinion that most of these ideas would make sick amounts of money.

345
00:19:17,601 --> 00:19:29,120
Speaker 0: Sick, yes, but they would also cost sick amounts of money to make in most cases or amounts of time and the risk would be, you know, they'd be, I mean, the real risk we know wouldn't be so great.

346
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:34,960
Speaker 0: But the perceived risk by the business would be great and Nintendo, king of profits, would not go there.

347
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, Nintendo definitely is risk averse.

348
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,960
Speaker 0: Well, any big company is risk averse.

349
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:45,939
Speaker 1: Nintendo especially, remember when the DS came out and they're like, "It's not replacing the Game Boy, third pillar, third

350
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:46,260
Speaker 1: pillar.".

351
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,914
Speaker 0: Right, and then they're just like, "Yeah, we're

352
00:19:47,995 --> 00:19:48,237
Speaker 0: lying.".

353
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:55,740
Speaker 0: We were just saying that in case the DS plopped, we could keep the GBA up and then come out with like a better GBA in a few weeks.

354
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,340
Speaker 1: So, let's talk DS first because I think it's pretty simple.

355
00:19:58,560 --> 00:20:00,219
Speaker 0: Right, we'll do DS, then Wii, then DS/Wii.

356
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:11,260
Speaker 1: Most importantly is I would make a lot more use of the local Wi-Fi and make a lot of simple, fun, competitive, directly games that you can play with all your friends.

357
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:18,720
Speaker 0: I think there are a lot of these games already, but most of them tend to be puzzle games and stuff like that, like the Tetris works pretty well and so does the Puzzle League.

358
00:20:19,460 --> 00:20:25,080
Speaker 0: And they got the Worms kind of works now and stuff, but definitely a lot more could be done in this area.

359
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,740
Speaker 0: And plus, a lot of games they have now are controlled with the stylus in some way, which is good.

360
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:37,420
Speaker 0: But a lot of those games, the stylus is generally used as a mouse and it's like that game would work just as well with a mouse.

361
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:43,016
Speaker 0: But there are some games, there are only a handful of games that use the stylus in an actual way.

362
00:20:43,056 --> 00:20:44,340
Speaker 0: a mouse could not be used.

363
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:46,319
Speaker 0: For example, Kirby's Canvas Curse.

364
00:20:47,020 --> 00:20:56,720
Speaker 0: And I know it's kind of hard to think of specific ideas of how to make a game that's really stylus innovative, but maybe someone should try us harder because there hasn't been much success with that.

365
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:03,140
Speaker 1: At the same time, I would not feel any way obligated to use the stylus at all if a game didn't require it.

366
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:11,820
Speaker 0: In general, I think people need to, if you're going to make a game for the DS, don't go trying to use DS features of the DS Extra.

367
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,146
Speaker 0: If they're not part of your game, they're not part of your game.

368
00:21:14,206 --> 00:21:18,580
Speaker 0: Just make your game, and if your game happens to be a game that uses those features, do it.

369
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,685
Speaker 0: And if it's not, don't.

370
00:21:19,805 --> 00:21:22,820
Speaker 0: Too many games like using that microphone that just screws you over.

371
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:25,680
Speaker 1: Oh, that microphone has never been used for anything good ever.

372
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,061
Speaker 1: Nope.

373
00:21:26,263 --> 00:21:28,420
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess PYP is all it should be used for, really.

374
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:30,858
Speaker 1: But how well did that really work?

375
00:21:31,484 --> 00:21:31,908
Speaker 0: I don't know.

376
00:21:31,928 --> 00:21:33,279
Speaker 0: I haven't really tried it so much.

377
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:37,080
Speaker 1: At least on the DS Lite, they moved the microphone to a much better place.

378
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:38,423
Speaker 0: Yep.

379
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:42,580
Speaker 0: But, you know, in general, people who are making games can do that.

380
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:52,220
Speaker 0: But, to achieve the full potential, someone really needs to think up new games that specifically are designed around the features instead of happen to use them.

381
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,101
Speaker 1: Like, think of this.

382
00:21:53,382 --> 00:22:05,540
Speaker 1: In a multiplayer environment, the primary use of the DS when you're playing with friends, like the thing that you can't do with anything else, is that you can give one player information and not give it to other players.

383
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:08,208
Speaker 1: Players can go in different directions.

384
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:10,260
Speaker 1: You can do all sorts of things like that.

385
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:12,780
Speaker 1: I would make, well, you know, what if I were Nintendo?

386
00:22:13,102 --> 00:22:13,317
Speaker 0: War games.

387
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:16,951
Speaker 1: I would make a WarioWare for the DS.

388
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:19,440
Speaker 1: that was multiplayer and awesome.

389
00:22:20,045 --> 00:22:20,859
Speaker 0: Oh, that would be hot.

390
00:22:21,144 --> 00:22:21,815
Speaker 0: That would be the bomb.

391
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,194
Speaker 0: A multiplayer WarioWare DS where you could see what's going on up top.

392
00:22:26,214 --> 00:22:27,820
Speaker 0: You play your games down at the bottom.

393
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:34,200
Speaker 0: And you got all sorts of WarioWare games involving styluses and microphones and button pushing and who knows what.

394
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:38,776
Speaker 1: Because actually a lot of the games in the WarioWare for the DS were okay mini games.

395
00:22:38,796 --> 00:22:39,800
Speaker 1: They're a lot better than the Wii.

396
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:43,180
Speaker 1: The problem was that game didn't have multiplayer.

397
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:44,320
Speaker 0: At all.

398
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,185
Speaker 1: Which made it useless.

399
00:22:46,386 --> 00:22:50,520
Speaker 1: I stopped playing it as soon as I realized there was no multiplayer and I never picked it up again.

400
00:22:50,763 --> 00:22:51,457
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

401
00:22:52,902 --> 00:22:55,820
Speaker 0: Oh, Nintendo failing in multiplayer on pretty much all fronts.

402
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,440
Speaker 1: Also, this friend code business.

403
00:22:59,261 --> 00:22:59,957
Speaker 0: This has got to end.

404
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,020
Speaker 1: Why is Nintendo so afraid of pedophiles?

405
00:23:04,161 --> 00:23:08,040
Speaker 1: All they have done is crippled their wireless to the point that only 11 year olds use it.

406
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:15,080
Speaker 0: The only Nintendo multiplayer that's worth playing is a bunch of people in the same room with a Wii or a bunch of people in the same room who all have DS's.

407
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,260
Speaker 0: Otherwise, multiplayer pretty useless.

408
00:23:17,401 --> 00:23:21,135
Speaker 0: The WFC, I mean I got every game that hooks up to it.

409
00:23:21,175 --> 00:23:22,440
Speaker 0: I got a lot of games that hook up to it.

410
00:23:23,345 --> 00:23:24,520
Speaker 0: I never really use it, ever.

411
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:28,660
Speaker 0: I used it to trade Pokemon more than anything else and now I don't play Pokemon.

412
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:32,220
Speaker 1: I played Mario Kart on it until I decided I didn't like Mario Kart anymore.

413
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,800
Speaker 0: The WFC as it stands is completely useless.

414
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,120
Speaker 0: But if they would make something like Xbox Live, it would be the business.

415
00:23:40,664 --> 00:23:41,779
Speaker 0: Or something like Steam.

416
00:23:42,481 --> 00:23:43,559
Speaker 1: You could even just set it up.

417
00:23:43,983 --> 00:23:46,240
Speaker 1: I'm not going to get into that because that's well beyond the scope.

418
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:47,510
Speaker 1: That's not if we had a dev kit.

419
00:23:47,531 --> 00:23:48,460
Speaker 1: That's if we were Nintendo.

420
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,819
Speaker 1: But yeah, in terms of the DS, I'll bridge this.

421
00:23:52,720 --> 00:24:01,420
Speaker 1: They really need, if it's possible, and it seems like it is, to make games where you use the DS as a controller for the Wii.

422
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,452
Speaker 0: Well, I thought we should talk about this last.

423
00:24:03,472 --> 00:24:04,540
Speaker 0: We should talk about the Wii first.

424
00:24:04,721 --> 00:24:05,040
Speaker 0: Alright.

425
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,440
Speaker 0: We'll do the DS, then the Wii, then both.

426
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:12,300
Speaker 1: We'll end on that because I think that is the place where Nintendo could create transcendent gaming experiences.

427
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,640
Speaker 0: They did it with Pokemon, but we'll talk about it later.

428
00:24:15,580 --> 00:24:17,169
Speaker 0: Alright, so, the Wii.

429
00:24:17,491 --> 00:24:19,200
Speaker 0: What is the Wii not doing?

430
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,805
Speaker 1: Alright, first things first.

431
00:24:21,227 --> 00:24:24,640
Speaker 1: I would go get the license, because I think Vivendi has them, but I can't tell.

432
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:29,000
Speaker 1: To all of the Quest for Glory, Police Quest, and Space Quest games.

433
00:24:29,863 --> 00:24:31,880
Speaker 1: And just port them directly to the Wii.

434
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:45,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, the Wii is in its position where you have the first time ever an electronic console of some sort that can display things on a television, but there is a pointing device which does not suck.

435
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:51,140
Speaker 0: I mean, you can go and try to buy some Logitech pointing device or some fancy laser pointer or something.

436
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:54,920
Speaker 0: The Wiimote pretty much beats them all in terms of a pointing device.

437
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,480
Speaker 0: It's like the first mouse you can use on a TV screen sitting on your couch.

438
00:24:59,701 --> 00:25:17,360
Speaker 0: And that alone, they should go back, and there are all these mouse-based games from back in the day, or presently, or even in the future, and just bring them out, because PC gaming, as much as people yell about it, largely not where it used to be, but there's a lot of old PC games that almost no one has played.

439
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:22,278
Speaker 0: You can come out with some Maniac Mansion for the Wii and start playing it with your Wiimote.

440
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:22,700
Speaker 0: Why not?

441
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:24,846
Speaker 1: Make sequels to all those games.

442
00:25:25,127 --> 00:25:29,000
Speaker 1: Port them, figure out which ones are popular, make sequels, make money.

443
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:36,339
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's all kinds of games that we can now enjoy in our living room instead of at our computers because we have a pointing device in the living room.

444
00:25:37,105 --> 00:25:38,373
Speaker 0: And we need that action.

445
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:39,440
Speaker 0: We need that action now.

446
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:49,840
Speaker 1: Now, it would depend on licensing, and I guess fortunately and unfortunately, fortunately for them, Microsoft has jumped all on this with German board games.

447
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:50,451
Speaker 0: Yeah.

448
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,803
Speaker 1: You know how hard.

449
00:25:51,863 --> 00:26:02,520
Speaker 1: if I had a dev kit, or I had been Nintendo, I would have begged and pushed and bribed to get the license to release every good German board game ever on the Wii with multiplayer?

450
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:06,854
Speaker 0: Well, the 360 already has Settlers and Carcassonne.

451
00:26:07,516 --> 00:26:08,860
Speaker 0: So, the Wii.

452
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:10,919
Speaker 1: But imagine that with the Wiimote.

453
00:26:11,383 --> 00:26:11,554
Speaker 0: Yep.

454
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:12,266
Speaker 1: Snap.

455
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,960
Speaker 0: Playing your Carcassonne tile by pointing instead of using your arrows.

456
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,219
Speaker 1: Just rotating it in your hand?

457
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:18,604
Speaker 1: Yep.

458
00:26:19,063 --> 00:26:19,436
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

459
00:26:20,285 --> 00:26:21,200
Speaker 1: Oh, that would be good.

460
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,984
Speaker 1: That would be.

461
00:26:22,004 --> 00:26:24,159
Speaker 1: I thought about that so much.

462
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:35,700
Speaker 0: But no, it's on the 360 where it is, I guess, I guess it's better on the 360 because multiplayer is essential there and that's where the multiplayer works, but using the Wiimote to play would be ultimate.

463
00:26:36,280 --> 00:26:37,130
Speaker 0: So, I guess, yeah.

464
00:26:37,555 --> 00:26:37,778
Speaker 0: Oh, well.

465
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,180
Speaker 0: What else is the Wiimote not doing?

466
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:43,914
Speaker 0: Well, the Wii not doing is, you know, they came out with Wii Sports as a game.

467
00:26:43,954 --> 00:26:52,360
Speaker 0: that showed you, at least the bowling and some of the other ones, you know, kind of okay, showed you that there were games where you could, you know, swing around the Wiimote to really play.

468
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:57,580
Speaker 0: But other than that, all the games I'm playing on the Wii are not really standing up.

469
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,640
Speaker 0: I mean, I played Metroid and I was using the Wiimote as a pointing device, you know.

470
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:05,020
Speaker 0: It was basically like I had a gamepad in my hands, but also a pointing device.

471
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:07,719
Speaker 0: And saying Trauma Center, same way.

472
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:14,347
Speaker 0: Pretty much every game I'm actually playing on the Wii, I guess Guitar Hero, but that's no different than, you know, it's a plastic guitar.

473
00:27:14,387 --> 00:27:15,980
Speaker 0: The Wiimote only adds to the guitar.

474
00:27:17,061 --> 00:27:19,940
Speaker 0: Only Wii Sports am I swinging around a whole bunch.

475
00:27:20,461 --> 00:27:24,600
Speaker 0: There's definitely a lot of potential for more swinging around games and they're just not making any.

476
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:25,600
Speaker 0: And I was even thinking.

477
00:27:25,902 --> 00:27:26,519
Speaker 0: Or they're not good.

478
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:29,500
Speaker 0: Like Wii Play was not good.

479
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,159
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't.

480
00:27:30,843 --> 00:27:32,500
Speaker 1: But no one's made a good sword game yet.

481
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:40,997
Speaker 1: I know people say, "Oh, well, because the pointing precision is really good with that camera, the accelerometer precision is not absolute and there'd be a lot of problems with the sword

482
00:27:41,037 --> 00:27:41,238
Speaker 1: game.".

483
00:27:42,381 --> 00:27:44,217
Speaker 1: There are a lot of ways around that and no one's done it.

484
00:27:45,481 --> 00:27:53,120
Speaker 0: The problem is because people have this unreasonable expectation that somehow, like the sword on the screen will exactly mimic, you know, the Wiimote in your hand.

485
00:27:53,180 --> 00:27:54,040
Speaker 0: That's never going to happen.

486
00:27:54,645 --> 00:27:56,159
Speaker 1: Well, I thought of a way to get close.

487
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:09,499
Speaker 1: But two, instead of having, you could have it gesture based because the accelerometers, while they're not good at telling the Wii where the Wiimote is, they're very good at telling it where it used to be as opposed to where it is right now.

488
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:20,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, they know if you, you know, they might not know exactly you moved the Wiimote left this many millimeters and up this many millimeters and forward this many millimeters, you know, to get an exact measurement and exactly move the sword.

489
00:28:20,660 --> 00:28:31,680
Speaker 1: But you could make sword games where you had like ten possible gestures in the air that did ten different sword moves that were similar to those gestures and then you could have some sort of fighting game.

490
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:37,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem that, I mean there is a potential there to make a gesture based sword fighting game that could be good.

491
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:51,670
Speaker 0: The problem is a lot of those gesture based games, like Madden, the first Madden for the Wii which I have is sort of gesture based and some of the other games have some gesture action and some of the gestures are kind of flunky and they don't do exactly what you want all the time.

492
00:28:51,690 --> 00:29:03,360
Speaker 0: or like the boxing is semi gesture based, you know, and it's like, it can be kind of a hurdle for people to learn all those gestures and then actually be able to execute them with, you know, decent enough reliability.

493
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:11,099
Speaker 1: See, I think the sword could be a little bit better just because, especially if you make it all fanciful and what kids would like, the gestures would generally be very sweeping and fast.

494
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:12,517
Speaker 0: Yep, something like that.

495
00:29:13,226 --> 00:29:18,080
Speaker 0: Or... It could be done, I just, there's a, if you try it, you're gonna fail nine times out of ten to make it good.

496
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:30,080
Speaker 1: Or if you needed more accuracy in holding a sword up, I guess you could have camera sensors in the hilt pointing out instead of on the tip pointing out and then you'd be able to use that for better accurate positioning.

497
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:38,413
Speaker 0: See, I'm just thinking about games like, you know, snowball fight, everyone sits around throwing snowballs at each other, you know, stuff like that where, you know, you're actually throwing.

498
00:29:38,433 --> 00:29:42,720
Speaker 0: because right now, you know, games like that is sort of like you aim and then you push the B button.

499
00:29:43,342 --> 00:29:48,080
Speaker 1: Or just more, I don't know, direct, real games against people.

500
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:53,180
Speaker 1: I mean, we play, like the tank game, we burned through the game because we wanted to play the tank game.

501
00:29:53,740 --> 00:30:00,180
Speaker 1: When I discovered that the tank game was not kill your opponent but don't die and kill the computers, all the fun disappeared.

502
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:03,020
Speaker 0: Yep, there's definitely not enough multiplayer action.

503
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:15,600
Speaker 0: I think it seems like there's some hesitation to do split screen, which was not a hesitation before, but I can see that because with the Wiimote, you know, it might be hard if you're using it as a pointing device, aiming at a quarter of the screen, not so hot.

504
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:27,845
Speaker 0: You know, it works in like Excite Truck because you're not aiming, you're not using the pointing device feature of the Wiimote, so you can do a split screen, but in other games, if you're using the pointing device, split screen is not an option, so multiplayer starts hurting.

505
00:30:28,326 --> 00:30:32,160
Speaker 0: and then because, you know, the Wi-Fi really sucks, multiplayer is hurt even more.

506
00:30:32,881 --> 00:30:36,880
Speaker 0: And if that was fixed, well, there would be a pretty awesomeness on the Wii.

507
00:30:37,281 --> 00:30:46,980
Speaker 1: Huh, so how could we give players their own screens on the Wii and yet not have to take away screen real estate?

508
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,100
Speaker 0: Maybe if you use the DS screen?

509
00:30:49,845 --> 00:30:50,658
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe, huh.

510
00:30:50,900 --> 00:31:05,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, right now, if you get Pokémon Wii, Battle Revolution, whatever they call it, right, you can have your Pokémon or your DS connect to that, use your Pokémon or your DS to pick your moves, and then the Pokémon on the screen will be on the TV with the Wii fighting it out.

511
00:31:05,442 --> 00:31:06,098
Speaker 0: Now, that's cool.

512
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,559
Speaker 0: This is an existing technology.

513
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:29,919
Speaker 1: Now, they had Crystal Chronicles, I mean, there was, remember you could connect the Game Boy Advance to the GameCube, and it was obviously at best a tech demo, but at the same time, despite the fact that it was incredibly limited and incredibly high latency and barely worthwhile, Crystal Chronicles and Four Swords were incredibly fun if you played them with three other

514
00:31:29,939 --> 00:31:30,159
Speaker 0: people.

515
00:31:30,761 --> 00:31:37,839
Speaker 0: If you haven't played Four Swords for the GameCube, get some GBAs, come on, they're cheap, alright, and frickin' hook that shit up right now.

516
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,979
Speaker 0: Get three friends and go.

517
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:45,620
Speaker 1: You could just release those games on the DS straight up because they only need two screens.

518
00:31:46,201 --> 00:31:50,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like there was Four Swords for the GBA and there was Four Swords for the GameCube.

519
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,905
Speaker 0: Why don't they release the GameCube?

520
00:31:51,945 --> 00:31:53,550
Speaker 0: Four Swords for the DS?

521
00:31:53,871 --> 00:31:54,253
Speaker 0: Why not?

522
00:31:55,156 --> 00:31:56,039
Speaker 0: I don't understand why not.

523
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,520
Speaker 1: But just think of the potential.

524
00:31:59,922 --> 00:32:04,540
Speaker 1: If they actually started making games that did the Crystal Chronicles thing, but with the DS.

525
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:06,084
Speaker 1: I mean, oh, it's not just.

526
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:15,320
Speaker 0: you have three screens, but now you've got four players with a relatively-- You can have more than--technologically, I don't see why you couldn't have 16 players, but four players is enough.

527
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,020
Speaker 1: Well, alright, you've got a number of players.

528
00:32:17,721 --> 00:32:27,860
Speaker 0: Each one has their own input device, their own two screens, their own stylus-- Not to mention their input device is a stylus, and they have, you know, a full set of buttons and a microphone.

529
00:32:28,304 --> 00:32:29,999
Speaker 1: And there's the TV in the room.

530
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:30,620
Speaker 0: Yep.

531
00:32:31,323 --> 00:32:39,320
Speaker 0: So it's like the TV has the information that's shared between everybody, you know, publicly known information among all players, and the DS has private information for each player.

532
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:45,120
Speaker 1: And it's not the tiny bandwidth channel that you had with the old system, so you can actually do stuff.

533
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,925
Speaker 1: The Wii is more powerful.

534
00:32:47,346 --> 00:32:51,560
Speaker 1: You can have a game like Crystal Chronicles, only you don't need the stupid bus kit.

535
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,420
Speaker 1: The bus kit really existed to keep everyone on the same screen.

536
00:32:54,883 --> 00:32:56,900
Speaker 1: What if everyone actually had their own screen?

537
00:32:57,100 --> 00:33:03,059
Speaker 1: And the puzzles were like, "Alright, you two go over to the north part and do this thing, and I'll go around and hit this switch, and then we'll do something

538
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:03,279
Speaker 1: cool.".

539
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:04,588
Speaker 0: Yeah.

540
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,400
Speaker 0: Or, you know, what other kind of potential is there?

541
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:13,460
Speaker 0: You could have a game, say, I don't want to say Counter-Strike because I don't think an FPS would work, but imagine, you know-- Hide and seek!

542
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, hide and seek, sure.

543
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:22,300
Speaker 1: A third person, hide and seek, would--especially to kids who really like games, like, how well would that sell?

544
00:33:22,702 --> 00:33:23,280
Speaker 0: I don't know, I'd play.

545
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:26,140
Speaker 1: Every grandma--I'd play it too, and every grandma would buy it for her grandson.

546
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:33,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could even just have, like, you know, a Bomberman like that, where you can see the whole screen up top, but then everyone has their own little screen.

547
00:33:33,460 --> 00:33:44,160
Speaker 1: Or you could have games where two--some people--it's like one guy versus everyone, or someone--like, some people are trying to get through a maze, but other people are drawing walls in the maze, and they come across--.

548
00:33:45,181 --> 00:33:51,440
Speaker 1: The reason I'm not getting specific here is because I can think--I basically have a nerdgasm of ideas every time I consider this idea.

549
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:59,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like, if they just let, you know, anyone who wanted to make games and sell them, there'd be a bajillion amazing games like this all over the place.

550
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:02,507
Speaker 1: I--actually, you know what they should do?

551
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:05,680
Speaker 1: There's a nice, elegant way around the Atari problem.

552
00:34:06,220 --> 00:34:15,840
Speaker 1: What if they didn't open it up, but they said, you know, "Alright, everyone, anyone who wants to enter into this contest will have to sign a thing and pay a fee, and then you're allowed to have a dev kit.

553
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:20,987
Speaker 1: And you make a game, and there's like a year, and everyone who signed up makes a game.

554
00:34:21,007 --> 00:34:28,259
Speaker 1: Nintendo takes them all, and does some sort of judging, declares winners, hires those people to make more games, and sells them

555
00:34:28,339 --> 00:34:28,438
Speaker 1: all.".

556
00:34:28,940 --> 00:34:35,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, Nintendo just really, you know, it--because pretty much the way Nintendo is, it's well known that the third parties are not, you know, so pleased.

557
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:42,719
Speaker 0: The third parties are doing a lot with Nintendo now because, you know, they sold so many Wii's that they can't afford not to, you know, make some games for that platform.

558
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:47,234
Speaker 0: But, on the whole, third parties, you know, you go on to Nintendo, right?

559
00:34:47,274 --> 00:34:49,060
Speaker 0: People only buy so many video games a year.

560
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:52,608
Speaker 0: If you have Wii, Nintendo's making, say, ten games a year.

561
00:34:52,628 --> 00:34:57,580
Speaker 0: Those are the ten games you're gonna buy, because those are gonna be the ten best games, and it's hard for anyone to compete with those games.

562
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:01,560
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, unless you're the kind of person who likes to throw hats at gongs.

563
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:02,521
Speaker 0: I guess.

564
00:35:03,864 --> 00:35:12,140
Speaker 0: But, um, so, third parties generally stay away, and that's why, you know, you mostly just get Nintendo games, and Nintendo games, and Nintendo games.

565
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:17,889
Speaker 0: But, as a result, Wii and all of other Nintendo's platforms don't get a lot of variety and innovation.

566
00:35:17,909 --> 00:35:20,594
Speaker 0: That's why things like, you know, Katamari don't come out on the Wii.

567
00:35:20,614 --> 00:35:24,280
Speaker 0: They come out on, like, the PS2, where there's a billion people making a billion games.

568
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:36,260
Speaker 0: So, Nintendo really needs to open that shit up, and then you'll start to see stuff, you know, that is like Portal and Katamari are on the other platforms, but on the Wii instead, where the most potential for that kind of thing to happen is.

569
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:40,248
Speaker 0: It's like, where is all the potential for something like Portal or Katamari to happen?

570
00:35:40,288 --> 00:35:40,669
Speaker 0: On the Wii.

571
00:35:40,709 --> 00:35:41,410
Speaker 0: Where does it happen?

572
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:46,120
Speaker 0: The PC and the PS2, because that's where the openness is, even though the potential hasn't changed in years.

573
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:49,529
Speaker 1: I guess the real problem is Nintendo has no reason to do this.

574
00:35:49,549 --> 00:35:50,613
Speaker 1: They have no reason to even care.

575
00:35:50,633 --> 00:35:52,480
Speaker 1: They're printing money continuously.

576
00:35:53,302 --> 00:35:55,085
Speaker 0: And which is why we'll always be disappointed.

577
00:35:55,105 --> 00:35:56,869
Speaker 0: That's why Apple, we're always gonna be disappointed.

578
00:35:56,889 --> 00:36:02,320
Speaker 0: It's like, the potential of the iPhone could be a life-changing device, a world-changing device.

579
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:05,192
Speaker 0: Instead, it's just a semi-changing device.

580
00:36:05,735 --> 00:36:07,780
Speaker 0: Only because Apple is- Optimus Prime?

581
00:36:08,774 --> 00:36:08,940
Speaker 1: What?

582
00:36:09,281 --> 00:36:10,819
Speaker 1: A semi-changing device?

583
00:36:11,441 --> 00:36:11,526
Speaker 0: Yeah.

584
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,043
Speaker 0: Oh.

585
00:36:15,162 --> 00:36:18,700
Speaker 0: And only because Apple and wireless providers are all assholes.

586
00:36:19,222 --> 00:36:23,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I thought, according to the internet, the Google phone was gonna come out and save everyone.

587
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:24,718
Speaker 0: They're all assholes too.

588
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:25,009
Speaker 1: Huh.

589
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:25,598
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:26,682
Speaker 1: I don't know.

591
00:36:27,726 --> 00:36:30,960
Speaker 1: Someday maybe we'll buy a dev kit if Nintendo would deign to give us one.

592
00:36:32,343 --> 00:36:34,968
Speaker 0: Even the potential for board games alone.

593
00:36:35,028 --> 00:36:37,293
Speaker 0: How many board games do you have?

594
00:36:37,694 --> 00:36:39,518
Speaker 0: Everyone has a hidden thing.

595
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:40,600
Speaker 0: What cards are in your hand?

596
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:45,131
Speaker 0: DS is the cards, the board, the table, on the TV.

597
00:36:45,672 --> 00:36:48,460
Speaker 0: Any board game, any card game can be turned into a DS Wii game.

598
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,840
Speaker 1: Hell, just sell- make a deal with Yahoo and have Yahoo games on the Wii.

599
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:53,453
Speaker 0: Yeah.

600
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,218
Speaker 1: Just straight up.

601
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,565
Speaker 0: Yahoo games are just Java.

602
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,731
Speaker 0: Java runs on anything.

603
00:36:56,751 --> 00:36:58,460
Speaker 0: Just make a JVM for- nope, you're good.

604
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:06,020
Speaker 1: And with the thing, you know, you can just- you grab the cards, you can play hearts with people in some sort of ladder or whatever, just like on the internet.

605
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:11,777
Speaker 0: That is one thing Microsoft has always been the master of, and that is the common casual game.

606
00:37:11,797 --> 00:37:12,900
Speaker 0: You know, that's their department.

607
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:14,766
Speaker 0: You know, they got Uno going on now, right?

608
00:37:15,027 --> 00:37:18,640
Speaker 0: They've had Hearts and Minesweeper in Solitaire going on for how long, right?

609
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,083
Speaker 0: They are the masters of that.

610
00:37:20,204 --> 00:37:26,620
Speaker 0: And, you know, for Nintendo, you get some third-party hacks trying to make stuff for the DS or the Wii that do that, but they're not good.

611
00:37:27,081 --> 00:37:32,937
Speaker 0: You know, they just made, you know, those games the way as quality as Microsoft makes them.

612
00:37:33,258 --> 00:37:33,880
Speaker 0: It would be the best.

613
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:44,238
Speaker 0: I mean, think, you know, Microsoft Hearts is fun and all, but imagine playing, you know, poker, but your hand is on your DS and, you know, you see the table and all the other people on the TV screen.

614
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:45,080
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

615
00:37:45,381 --> 00:37:47,600
Speaker 1: Especially if you can play over to internet.

616
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,443
Speaker 0: Without stupid friend codes.

617
00:37:51,168 --> 00:37:52,531
Speaker 0: There's no reason why it can't happen.

618
00:37:52,571 --> 00:37:53,654
Speaker 0: The technology exists.

619
00:37:54,215 --> 00:37:55,659
Speaker 0: It's just people not doing it.

620
00:37:56,421 --> 00:37:58,526
Speaker 1: Mostly because there's no reason to.

621
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:04,160
Speaker 1: If I already have ten million dollars, I don't need another ten million dollars.

622
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:13,660
Speaker 0: Well, you do, but are you gonna do the thing that might give you ten million dollars or keep doing the same thing that keeps making you ten millions of more dollars that you know is gonna work?

623
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,084
Speaker 0: Or the thing that might work that you've never tried before?

624
00:38:16,385 --> 00:38:24,100
Speaker 0: Especially when, as much as I complain, I'm still buying the Mario Galaxies and all these things that don't live up to the potential because they're still awesome.

625
00:38:24,482 --> 00:38:27,435
Speaker 1: It's like there's a line and they're well above the line.

626
00:38:27,475 --> 00:38:28,460
Speaker 1: They're great games.

627
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:37,657
Speaker 0: It's like they're doing all these things that are amazing that I want to do, but the potential is just so much higher, so I'll be eternally disappointed, but also eternally sated.

628
00:38:37,777 --> 00:38:38,940
Speaker 0: It's fucked up.

629
00:38:39,722 --> 00:38:41,960
Speaker 1: Ah, the sad life of a gamer.

630
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,628
Speaker 0: It's like I'm sitting there and I'm like, wow, this is a really good cake.

631
00:38:46,149 --> 00:38:50,780
Speaker 0: But I know in my brain that there are better cakes, or at least there could be better cakes.

632
00:38:50,941 --> 00:38:54,480
Speaker 0: I know, in fact, a specific recipe for a cake that tastes twice as good.

633
00:38:54,580 --> 00:38:57,912
Speaker 1: So you go to the chef and say, "Chef, add this to the cake,".

634
00:38:57,953 --> 00:38:58,916
Speaker 1: and he says, "No, you are

635
00:38:58,956 --> 00:38:59,458
Speaker 1: stupid.".

636
00:39:00,161 --> 00:39:04,050
Speaker 0: He's like, "You might eat it, but I do not know about these other customers and I'm not going to survey them.

637
00:39:04,331 --> 00:39:07,739
Speaker 0: They like my cake as it is and they still sell all my cakes every

638
00:39:07,759 --> 00:39:07,959
Speaker 0: day.".

639
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,166
Speaker 1: So I say, "Fine, I'll make the cake on my

640
00:39:10,226 --> 00:39:10,326
Speaker 1: own.".

641
00:39:10,347 --> 00:39:14,178
Speaker 1: He says, "No, you can't because I have patented the Cake Dev

642
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:14,479
Speaker 1: Kit.".

643
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,111
Speaker 0: Yes, I have all the ovens.

644
00:39:17,513 --> 00:39:18,940
Speaker 0: All your ovens belong to me.

645
00:39:19,302 --> 00:39:20,390
Speaker 1: The cake is a lie.

646
00:39:20,994 --> 00:39:21,700
Speaker 1: There's no cake.

647
00:39:23,103 --> 00:39:24,039
Speaker 0: Do we have anything else to say?

648
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:24,282
Speaker 0: No.

649
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,740
Speaker 0: Didn't we want to keep it short because Libsyn's running out?

650
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:27,522
Speaker 1: Something like that.

651
00:39:27,542 --> 00:39:32,940
Speaker 1: This will be a short week, followed probably next week by a long, long, incredibly long week.

652
00:39:33,260 --> 00:39:34,700
Speaker 0: You mean Inside Scott's Pants week?

653
00:39:42,690 --> 00:39:44,879
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

654
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,430
