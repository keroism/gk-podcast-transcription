1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:11,466
Speaker 1: It's Monday September 10th.

2
00:00:11,927 --> 00:00:12,449
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:15,780
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:15,921 --> 00:00:19,320
Speaker 1: It's that time of the year and we cop out with a tech news round out.

5
00:00:24,361 --> 00:00:36,017
Speaker 0: Let's do this due to lack of Open EBIT news such and because we're doing a show full of news.

6
00:00:36,077 --> 00:00:39,409
Speaker 0: if you looked at the title I'm just gonna start with a little geek bite.

7
00:00:39,469 --> 00:00:41,015
Speaker 0: I guess it's sort of a geek bite.

8
00:00:41,255 --> 00:00:42,279
Speaker 0: I don't know if it really.

9
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,828
Speaker 1: yeah Why is that?

10
00:00:44,029 --> 00:00:45,296
Speaker 0: well so work right.

11
00:00:45,558 --> 00:00:45,940
Speaker 0: everyone.

12
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:51,998
Speaker 0: They have an exchange server and everyone with their Microsoft's offices is using outlook whatnot.

13
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:52,560
Speaker 0: That's fine.

14
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,209
Speaker 1: We have like freakin group wise.

15
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,637
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah an IBM.

16
00:00:55,657 --> 00:01:07,737
Speaker 0: We had Lotus Yeah, but you know one of my my co-worker the only other Linux guy the other developer He uses like evolution with the exchange plug-in and stuff and I tried to get that to work.

17
00:01:07,858 --> 00:01:08,700
Speaker 0: and it kind of works.

18
00:01:08,841 --> 00:01:13,058
Speaker 0: But it's not perfect and it's kind of slow and laggy and I'm Not a fan.

19
00:01:14,041 --> 00:01:23,205
Speaker 0: So I just been using the pop you know and it works for me, but The pop stopped working because the system in guy I don't know.

20
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:26,380
Speaker 0: He broke it does not fix it, and he won't restart the mail server.

21
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:37,344
Speaker 0: ha so I have been using the IMAP and Switching to IMAP from pop was kind of a pain because of the way you know desktop email Applications work.

22
00:01:37,786 --> 00:01:38,549
Speaker 0: Oh of course.

23
00:01:38,569 --> 00:01:41,160
Speaker 0: You know Gmail is awesome and desktop email applications suck.

24
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,187
Speaker 0: Let me get that right out of the way.

25
00:01:42,207 --> 00:01:46,468
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I mean once I went to Gmail I'm never going back.

26
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:50,211
Speaker 0: so in switching to IMAP I said well I can use any.

27
00:01:50,231 --> 00:01:51,519
Speaker 0: I don't have to use evolution here.

28
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:52,884
Speaker 0: you know which is what I've been using.

29
00:01:53,426 --> 00:01:54,309
Speaker 0: I could use anything.

30
00:01:54,349 --> 00:02:02,938
Speaker 0: so I tried evolution and Thunderbird and silfied and K-mail and they all suck balls, and that's all I got to say.

31
00:02:02,998 --> 00:02:07,596
Speaker 0: is Desktop email clients all suck balls every last one.

32
00:02:07,616 --> 00:02:10,673
Speaker 1: none of them are good I guess the few I use.

33
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,365
Speaker 1: before I gave up on them I was never really happy with.

34
00:02:13,446 --> 00:02:16,074
Speaker 1: and now that I have Google they all do.

35
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:17,900
Speaker 0: they all are exactly the same.

36
00:02:18,121 --> 00:02:19,305
Speaker 0: None of them offer features.

37
00:02:19,626 --> 00:02:22,979
Speaker 0: some of them might be lacking of features because they're the light ones.

38
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:27,414
Speaker 0: But like you know evolution came out and those big four right.

39
00:02:27,776 --> 00:02:29,120
Speaker 0: they have all the same features.

40
00:02:29,422 --> 00:02:30,709
Speaker 0: They do all the same things.

41
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:32,580
Speaker 0: they work in exactly the same way.

42
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:37,780
Speaker 0: There's really no differences except for you know the specific arrangement of the interface.

43
00:02:38,223 --> 00:02:40,840
Speaker 0: But the interfaces are generally all the same.

44
00:02:41,101 --> 00:02:51,326
Speaker 0: There's only slight differences that aren't very meaningful, and you could use them all interchangeably, and they all suck balls Huh, so no news just a geek bite.

45
00:02:51,827 --> 00:02:59,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you're using some sort of desktop email client with pops or IMAP Stop it.

46
00:03:00,109 --> 00:03:00,630
Speaker 0: It's not good.

47
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:08,580
Speaker 1: Yeah granted almost everyone has to use something like that at work, but frankly I couldn't care less what my company makes me use because it's their time.

48
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,834
Speaker 1: And if they want to use something slow and inefficient whatever it's not see.

49
00:03:12,874 --> 00:03:15,764
Speaker 0: it's not about you know what I care It's it's you know.

50
00:03:15,885 --> 00:03:16,949
Speaker 0: I'm using this thing.

51
00:03:16,990 --> 00:03:19,400
Speaker 0: I don't want it to be any more unpleasant than it has to be.

52
00:03:19,842 --> 00:03:20,525
Speaker 1: I just don't care.

53
00:03:20,706 --> 00:03:21,208
Speaker 1: worst case.

54
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,835
Speaker 1: I just stopped reading my email at work.

55
00:03:23,579 --> 00:03:24,903
Speaker 0: Oh Right.

56
00:03:24,963 --> 00:03:26,049
Speaker 1: so along those lines.

57
00:03:26,149 --> 00:03:28,985
Speaker 1: I don't have a news either, but I don't have a geek bite I have a geek back.

58
00:03:29,226 --> 00:03:30,814
Speaker 0: Oh, man's I didn't see any in there.

59
00:03:30,854 --> 00:03:31,558
Speaker 0: What do you see?

60
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:31,880
Speaker 1: well?

61
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:39,072
Speaker 1: This one's a slightly old one from not that old from August But from Vicus who was written to us, and if you other is it vicious.

62
00:03:39,413 --> 00:03:39,674
Speaker 1: No.

63
00:03:39,734 --> 00:03:48,440
Speaker 0: It's not because it's spelled differently It's vic hus yeah, which I think is just a way of internet spelling vicious sort of like Leac mudkips.

64
00:03:49,003 --> 00:03:50,672
Speaker 1: You know what I refuse to.

65
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:51,697
Speaker 1: that's like that.

66
00:03:51,778 --> 00:03:56,900
Speaker 1: way back I played the realm right and we formed a little clan or guild called the harpers.

67
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:02,129
Speaker 1: We all had names from all the D&D books But the name Al Minster was already taken.

68
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:05,480
Speaker 1: so I had my friend the great wizard el minister.

69
00:04:12,042 --> 00:04:12,926
Speaker 0: That's a really good one.

70
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,037
Speaker 1: I just I couldn't deal with that.

71
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:22,697
Speaker 1: Okay Vicus rights.

72
00:04:23,603 --> 00:04:28,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, you guys have a great point about the incestuous nous of podcast networks.

73
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:36,960
Speaker 1: I believe this is in reference to when we were complaining another geek back When we were complaining about all of our friend podcasters for promoting each other all the time.

74
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,760
Speaker 0: Well, it was when I did a geek back where someone suggested we make a podcast network.

75
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:42,346
Speaker 0: And I said podcast networks are stupid.

76
00:04:42,386 --> 00:04:55,975
Speaker 1: if we don't need one yeah, but anyway to continue Just feeding off of one another for common listeners, but in the example of comics podcast I'm obviously Clawsing over some pretty bad grammar here.

77
00:04:56,095 --> 00:04:56,619
Speaker 1: Sorry, dude.

78
00:04:57,842 --> 00:05:01,760
Speaker 1: Isn't the listenership really going to grow depending on how many people have an interest in comics?

79
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:08,980
Speaker 1: I mean even the most casual of podcasts out there that discuss common book comic books don't seem accessible to non geeks now.

80
00:05:09,161 --> 00:05:11,880
Speaker 1: Uh, I think you're kind of wrong here in that.

81
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,744
Speaker 1: well I guess technically you're perfectly correct.

82
00:05:14,205 --> 00:05:25,080
Speaker 1: a comic podcast can theoretically only have as many listeners as there are podcast fans plus the I don't know one to five percent of people who listen to podcasts about things they don't care about and there are people like that.

83
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:33,692
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't think you seem to realize that I would say maybe Maybe five to ten percent of comic book readers.

84
00:05:33,812 --> 00:05:38,120
Speaker 1: if that and I'm talking about the upper bound I've ever even heard of a podcast.

85
00:05:38,582 --> 00:05:49,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there are a zillion comic book podcasts and in terms of geekeries out there It's you know that have podcasts like comic books is one of the geekeries that has a lot of podcasts.

86
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:57,580
Speaker 0: You know talking about it, but even then there are so many more people who are into comics.

87
00:05:58,282 --> 00:06:15,092
Speaker 0: I mean even though that is such a small number of people relative to other things because comics are sort of you know marginalized and niche these days especially in the US That and podcast there's just so many more Despite the small number of comics readers.

88
00:06:15,453 --> 00:06:17,320
Speaker 0: There are even less podcast listeners.

89
00:06:18,522 --> 00:06:28,600
Speaker 1: It's I mean that's how that's how small podcasting is because other people have said this to us before Hey, if you're just focusing on geeky stuff, then you've already got all the geeks and you're not gonna grow from there.

90
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,166
Speaker 1: No, we don't have any of the geeks.

91
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:33,819
Speaker 1: We have so few people listening to podcast period right now.

92
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:45,663
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean if We're limited basically by the inability to get more people to listen to podcasts Period not the fact that there aren't enough geeks out there I mean think of this.

93
00:06:45,884 --> 00:06:48,855
Speaker 1: let's look at the world of anime, you know, Japanese animation.

94
00:06:49,477 --> 00:06:53,767
Speaker 1: according to Wikipedia There are only like two or three podcasts about anime.

95
00:06:53,787 --> 00:06:56,819
Speaker 1: there even have any reasonable listenership or worth.

96
00:06:56,839 --> 00:07:00,492
Speaker 1: and Yet how many people who watch anime listen to podcast?

97
00:07:00,512 --> 00:07:01,315
Speaker 1: we go to Otakon.

98
00:07:01,355 --> 00:07:02,420
Speaker 0: think about we go to Otakon.

99
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:05,269
Speaker 0: There's 20,000 people at one convention.

100
00:07:05,811 --> 00:07:08,740
Speaker 0: how many people listen to anime world order?

101
00:07:09,582 --> 00:07:11,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, not that many.

102
00:07:11,982 --> 00:07:16,620
Speaker 1: We spent most of the time at our artists alley table explaining to people what a podcast was.

103
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:19,539
Speaker 0: Some people were like I was like, you know, they were like, I don't have an iPod.

104
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,572
Speaker 0: I was like wait, they're like, I don't even have a computer.

105
00:07:21,633 --> 00:07:22,599
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh my god.

106
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:37,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, people who don't have the internet kind of like how on a recent anime world order Dara was doing his con report about the anime fans who were off the radar like the people who go to one con and they've never been on the internet and They just don't know about anime.

107
00:07:38,007 --> 00:07:40,980
Speaker 0: They never been to and you don't even know there's any such thing as a con.

108
00:07:41,088 --> 00:07:51,291
Speaker 1: well No What he was saying is a lot of those people end up at like one local con and their their anime culture Isn't known to most people because it's not on the internet.

109
00:07:51,351 --> 00:07:52,194
Speaker 1: It's not there.

110
00:07:52,475 --> 00:07:53,459
Speaker 1: You'll never see it.

111
00:07:53,901 --> 00:07:59,640
Speaker 1: These are the people who've never even heard a cowboy bebop never heard of Otakon never heard of a podcast don't have internet access.

112
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:08,031
Speaker 1: They're like 30 years old and they like I don't know whatever they like Go to a dealer's room see a CD are obviously that's legitimate.

113
00:08:08,452 --> 00:08:09,716
Speaker 0: They have no idea.

114
00:08:09,736 --> 00:08:10,960
Speaker 0: They're just completely clueless.

115
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:20,486
Speaker 0: They like anime because they've seen it somewhere and they're into it, but they're so clueless as about how to like, you know Really get into it.

116
00:08:20,627 --> 00:08:23,597
Speaker 0: It's it's a total mystery to them and they're totally out of the loop.

117
00:08:23,718 --> 00:08:24,240
Speaker 0: and you know what?

118
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,265
Speaker 0: Those are the vast majority of anime fans.

119
00:08:27,285 --> 00:08:37,191
Speaker 0: There are thousands upon thousands upon thousands of those people out there and As soon as they listen to an anime podcast, they're not one of those people anymore.

120
00:08:37,953 --> 00:08:50,233
Speaker 1: So I guess the moral here is that the topic of a podcast has almost nothing to do with limiting the audience because there are enough people out there to Satisfy the demand for just about any topic in the world.

121
00:08:50,575 --> 00:08:51,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's a podcast.

122
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:53,730
Speaker 0: I keep bringing it up because it's some example.

123
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:58,308
Speaker 0: I remember from the early days of podcasting There was a podcast about Australian real estate.

124
00:08:58,729 --> 00:08:59,492
Speaker 0: Think about that.

125
00:08:59,974 --> 00:09:01,860
Speaker 1: Well, I mean that island is pretty big.

126
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:08,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know but that podcast could get a bunch of listeners think about like every real estate agent in Australia.

127
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,296
Speaker 0: That's thousands of people probably but then no one knows to listen to podcasts.

128
00:09:12,396 --> 00:09:16,480
Speaker 0: That's their limitation Not the lack of potential audience the lack of actual audience.

129
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:23,300
Speaker 1: So, I mean, I guess my advice to all you podcasters out there and aspiring podcasters is don't play promos for other podcasts.

130
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,962
Speaker 1: Don't like.

131
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,670
Speaker 1: I'll promote your podcast if you promote my.

132
00:09:26,690 --> 00:09:32,839
Speaker 1: don't even bother with that because if you're listening to podcasts at all They're gonna find your show no matter what you do if they want to listen to it.

133
00:09:33,443 --> 00:09:36,399
Speaker 1: And there's no reason to market to these people or even care about these people.

134
00:09:36,823 --> 00:09:41,629
Speaker 1: no offense to all of our listeners, but You've really got to do the Nintendo thing the blue ocean.

135
00:09:41,669 --> 00:09:50,580
Speaker 1: go out there and find the people who really want a radio show about Making very detailed models of I don't know the woman who played Wonder Woman's breasts

136
00:09:51,162 --> 00:09:55,415
Speaker 0: But they have no idea that it exists and you have to let them know

137
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:57,562
Speaker 1: find them and tell them hey You know what?

138
00:09:58,024 --> 00:10:02,860
Speaker 1: There's a radio show or a video show or a TV show or whatever on the internet.

139
00:10:03,343 --> 00:10:06,160
Speaker 1: That's about everything you like for free.

140
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:11,220
Speaker 0: It's totally free and you can watch it whenever you want or listen to it whenever you want wherever you want.

141
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:15,995
Speaker 0: OMG, yeah, you don't even don't even tell them like a specific show.

142
00:10:16,035 --> 00:10:17,660
Speaker 0: You don't have to pimp any show in particular.

143
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:33,940
Speaker 0: Yes Get people who are not podcast viewers and listeners to become podcast viewers and listeners and then as soon as they realize how the Technology works and how they can take advantage of it for their own entertainment They will find the show or that they want to listen to or watch on their own.

144
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,550
Speaker 1: I mean look at Connecticut.

145
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,898
Speaker 1: we did a panel on podcasting.

146
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:41,040
Speaker 1: We didn't even really say what show we did for a long time or talk about ourselves at all.

147
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,979
Speaker 1: We talked about all the other podcasts we like.

148
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:58,820
Speaker 0: So stop trying to like up your listener numbers by trying to like group together people who are gonna be listeners of your show anyway, and just Get more listeners into the you know, make the market grow rather than trying to eat out a bigger piece of this incredibly small pie.

149
00:10:59,305 --> 00:11:00,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, thanks Vikas.

150
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:07,340
Speaker 1: You brought up an interesting point of discussion and it allowed me to once again poke fun of the practices of my fellow podcasters.

151
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:26,366
Speaker 1: So, I don't know how many of you are old enough to remember this song even though I can't really say that too Seriously because the song is even a little bit old for a Scott and myself.

152
00:11:26,446 --> 00:11:34,210
Speaker 1: It's kind of it's not old It's the nostalgia that it is intended to evoke is definitely for a generation slightly older than us.

153
00:11:34,451 --> 00:11:35,376
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's for sure.

154
00:11:35,436 --> 00:11:44,480
Speaker 0: But I've heard the song everyone's heard the song Even if you don't know who sings the song, you know the song Yeah, but I would wager that a lot of our listeners don't.

155
00:11:45,182 --> 00:11:48,070
Speaker 0: I could imagine that the punk kids don't know but everyone else knows.

156
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:51,646
Speaker 1: Yeah, mostly I brought that up because one all the people are old enough.

157
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:55,026
Speaker 1: so going god God, damn it you punk kids and it going.

158
00:11:55,067 --> 00:12:02,609
Speaker 1: wow We're all Because that's the worst thing when someone younger than you is complaining about how old they are.

159
00:12:03,111 --> 00:12:05,017
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I digress.

160
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:07,043
Speaker 1: so you've all heard the song.

161
00:12:07,063 --> 00:12:09,210
Speaker 1: I hope we didn't start the fire.

162
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:11,510
Speaker 1: You know, we didn't start the fire.

163
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,464
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna sing like Dave and Joel always try to do.

164
00:12:14,485 --> 00:12:18,644
Speaker 1: but uh I'm not gonna talk about my feelings on that song.

165
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:24,525
Speaker 1: but very briefly I'm generally of the mind that the song is kind of a cheesy cop-out.

166
00:12:24,565 --> 00:12:34,450
Speaker 1: It's one of those ideas of hey I'm just gonna load this song up with Nostalgia, even though it's actually really really repetitive and not that insightful or meaningful or anything.

167
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:37,081
Speaker 0: Well lyrically I would have to agree with you musically.

168
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:39,170
Speaker 0: It's an it's an average pop song.

169
00:12:39,451 --> 00:12:39,913
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just.

170
00:12:39,973 --> 00:12:40,716
Speaker 1: it's very.

171
00:12:40,736 --> 00:12:45,638
Speaker 1: I would almost say that that song was trite and manipulative Kind of.

172
00:12:46,064 --> 00:12:54,720
Speaker 1: but anyway the point is that regardless of how you feel about the song the song became a blockbuster success because People are heard the song and remembered all the things.

173
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:58,681
Speaker 1: just to kind of brings them back to all their times in their life And all the things they've lived through.

174
00:12:58,701 --> 00:13:05,505
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Well, there's a video circulating to internet that is attempting to do the same thing for the internet.

175
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:07,450
Speaker 1: It is entitled internet people.

176
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,076
Speaker 1: I'm sure you've all seen it already.

177
00:13:09,096 --> 00:13:13,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know a lot of you in the forum said wow, that was amazing.

178
00:13:13,371 --> 00:13:14,822
Speaker 1: Wow, I really felt it Wow.

179
00:13:15,064 --> 00:13:15,770
Speaker 1: How cool was that?

180
00:13:15,950 --> 00:13:17,826
Speaker 1: And I'm gonna say you should see it.

181
00:13:18,391 --> 00:13:23,790
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna take the contrary position and say that it was pretty piss-poor and I was really disappointed with it.

182
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:25,174
Speaker 0: I think it was kind of meh.

183
00:13:25,415 --> 00:13:33,224
Speaker 0: I mean that musically it was worse than we didn't start the fire lyrically nah slightly worse.

184
00:13:33,527 --> 00:13:39,490
Speaker 1: and The the animation that you know what you actually see in the video was poorly done and really not that clever.

185
00:13:39,831 --> 00:13:42,663
Speaker 1: It was one of those overly literal not interesting.

186
00:13:42,723 --> 00:13:44,169
Speaker 1: why even bother with the video things?

187
00:13:44,451 --> 00:13:49,730
Speaker 0: It's sort of one of those things where it's like I can't actually make something creative and popular.

188
00:13:49,871 --> 00:13:54,730
Speaker 0: So I'm just gonna aggregate creative and popular things and hopefully get like a you know a second run on it.

189
00:13:54,931 --> 00:13:55,735
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's one of those.

190
00:13:56,197 --> 00:13:57,865
Speaker 1: obviously the guy who did this our girl.

191
00:13:57,945 --> 00:14:00,936
Speaker 1: I didn't look at who did it I don't really care had the great idea.

192
00:14:01,237 --> 00:14:05,490
Speaker 1: Hey, why don't I make one of those nostalgia songs about the internet?

193
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:06,994
Speaker 1: And that'll make me famous.

194
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:09,602
Speaker 1: it kind of worked because the things super known and popular.

195
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:14,050
Speaker 1: but you really a for idea D for implementation.

196
00:14:14,931 --> 00:14:15,976
Speaker 0: Yeah, it really didn't.

197
00:14:16,076 --> 00:14:17,844
Speaker 0: I mean I watched it and I was just kind of like.

198
00:14:17,864 --> 00:14:19,109
Speaker 0: yeah, that's what that is.

199
00:14:19,431 --> 00:14:25,050
Speaker 1: The worst thing is it's it didn't even cover the real span of that sort of thing on the internet.

200
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:31,666
Speaker 1: It was way too recent and covered things that were so new or on Noteworthy that I didn't even I hadn't heard a lot of them.

201
00:14:31,706 --> 00:14:39,152
Speaker 0: to be honest Yeah, pretty much only covered things like since the existence of dig these people whoever made it wasn't really, you know There were.

202
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:42,290
Speaker 1: there are very few things in there that weren't super recent.

203
00:14:42,491 --> 00:14:49,061
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only old thing in there was like all your base and it's like Did you forget about like the pusher robot and the shovel robot?

204
00:14:49,443 --> 00:14:51,730
Speaker 0: Did you forget about like Zumble come?

205
00:14:51,990 --> 00:14:52,251
Speaker 1: Did you?

206
00:14:52,271 --> 00:15:01,006
Speaker 1: yeah, and even if you don't show it you gotta say or somehow bring up goats See because they did they said goat seed like the word appeared that it.

207
00:15:01,047 --> 00:15:01,810
Speaker 1: I didn't even notice that.

208
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:03,962
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they didn't mention the other ones though.

209
00:15:03,982 --> 00:15:07,109
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, or this is I don't know.

210
00:15:07,411 --> 00:15:12,849
Speaker 1: I'm really disappointed with that video and it surprises me that so many people like it so much because it.

211
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:22,010
Speaker 1: I Don't know if maybe my attention span is a few minutes longer than everyone else's but a lot of that stuff just wasn't that noteworthy or nostalgia worthy.

212
00:15:22,712 --> 00:15:27,908
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it mean someone coming up and saying hey rim, huh?

213
00:15:28,309 --> 00:15:32,722
Speaker 0: The What's the the the what the Numa Numa guy?

214
00:15:33,304 --> 00:15:36,576
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah the Numa Numa guy That's not gonna entertain me.

215
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:38,261
Speaker 0: Just someone saying hey, remember this.

216
00:15:38,823 --> 00:15:42,696
Speaker 0: so saying hey, remember this about everything Not any better.

217
00:15:42,977 --> 00:15:44,644
Speaker 1: at least it had Washington in it.

218
00:15:44,784 --> 00:15:45,286
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did.

219
00:15:45,407 --> 00:15:46,210
Speaker 0: it did have Washington.

220
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:53,950
Speaker 1: But yeah, the thing is Washington the real Washington despite being of similar graphic quality was actually so much better.

221
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:57,370
Speaker 0: The thing is I think for most of the stuff that was live-action, right?

222
00:15:57,691 --> 00:15:58,234
Speaker 0: They did.

223
00:15:58,294 --> 00:16:04,660
Speaker 0: they actually drew like they drew a Numa Numa guy who looked like King Hippo Yeah, but like they didn't draw Washington.

224
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:12,090
Speaker 0: They just copied and pasted Washington because he was already animated You know, they just it was kind of a yeah someone out there do something better.

225
00:16:12,211 --> 00:16:14,263
Speaker 1: I don't have the time or the inclination right now.

226
00:16:14,544 --> 00:16:15,409
Speaker 0: No, nor do I care.

227
00:16:15,912 --> 00:16:17,579
Speaker 1: Plus you really got to hit the more serious things.

228
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:19,286
Speaker 1: make it actually nostalgia worthy.

229
00:16:19,326 --> 00:16:19,969
Speaker 1: make it one of those.

230
00:16:20,591 --> 00:16:26,170
Speaker 0: Oh, man, the you can't just say the thing and show a picture and a you know drawing of it.

231
00:16:26,511 --> 00:16:35,629
Speaker 0: You got to have to like, you know, like bring it back Like you got to be like, you know And I don't just say like show like the Numa Numa guy going like my yeah

232
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:39,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, like cut to that as a musical bridge or yeah

233
00:16:40,091 --> 00:16:49,870
Speaker 0: or even in real like I just sort of merge them together in a new interesting way where the Combination of the parts actually creates a new hole rather than just referring to the originals.

234
00:16:50,071 --> 00:16:59,630
Speaker 1: I mean even we didn't start the fire musically it kept like the Music would build up and build down and come to climaxes when certain words were being said it was done.

235
00:16:59,710 --> 00:17:03,497
Speaker 1: Well and the music and this was just really But completely.

236
00:17:03,517 --> 00:17:06,209
Speaker 0: are we done talking about how sucky this is done making fun of this?

237
00:17:07,113 --> 00:17:23,748
Speaker 0: So some company it's a UK defense firm called kinetic with Q's instead of K's and They made a vehicle an unmanned flying vehicle that runs on the solar power.

238
00:17:23,768 --> 00:17:31,145
Speaker 0: Ooh and People have made these before but this one they say flew for 54 hours on its own.

239
00:17:33,911 --> 00:17:34,954
Speaker 0: That's like the record.

240
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:44,150
Speaker 0: but they didn't get the record because the people who are allowed to you know Decide if it was the record breaker or not did not watch because it was secret

241
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:45,432
Speaker 1: huh,

242
00:17:45,854 --> 00:17:51,942
Speaker 0: but now they say they're gonna do another one for like 33 hours that they'll be allowed to watch I guess.

243
00:17:51,982 --> 00:17:55,214
Speaker 0: so they can get the record and they're like Yeah, we can do this forever.

244
00:17:55,234 --> 00:17:59,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're gonna you know, to be honest the whole idea of world records.

245
00:17:59,871 --> 00:18:00,876
Speaker 1: I just don't care about it.

246
00:18:00,956 --> 00:18:01,700
Speaker 0: I don't care either.

247
00:18:02,001 --> 00:18:08,650
Speaker 0: But what I do care about is Unmanned flying things that can fly really high up and really far for a really long.

248
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:11,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, sadly, you know who else probably cares about that a lot.

249
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:13,510
Speaker 1: spy the military.

250
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:14,233
Speaker 0: Yes.

251
00:18:15,213 --> 00:18:23,930
Speaker 0: So while I could use one to say load up Google Maps I have a feeling that it's not gonna directly benefit me for a long time, but it could.

252
00:18:25,772 --> 00:18:26,917
Speaker 0: And it's cool to look at it.

253
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:27,380
Speaker 0: Looks good.

254
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,570
Speaker 0: It looks like a paper airplane, but made out of solar cells.

255
00:18:30,153 --> 00:18:32,810
Speaker 1: So we haven't done this in a while, but there's been a lot of tech news.

256
00:18:32,971 --> 00:18:37,836
Speaker 1: so I think it's finally about time to cop out and do a Tech news roundup.

257
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:46,209
Speaker 0: it helps is the perfect day to cop out and the news Timing is perfect and just everything sort of came together for us to beat to it at its own game.

258
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:51,847
Speaker 0: I'll tweet anyway, so obviously the biggest news did we discuss this on the show yet is the?

259
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:52,509
Speaker 0: I don't believe.

260
00:18:52,549 --> 00:18:55,230
Speaker 0: so All the new Apple action, all right.

261
00:18:55,591 --> 00:19:00,406
Speaker 0: So first you've got the iPhone going down in price from I think what 600 to 400, right?

262
00:19:02,310 --> 00:19:08,956
Speaker 0: I particularly like how there's that rebate whatever after it was two months of the iPhone at $600 and now it's $400.

263
00:19:08,956 --> 00:19:16,359
Speaker 0: then Because Steve Jobs said alright Anyone who bought the iPhone for $600 gets $100 in store credit.

264
00:19:19,510 --> 00:19:24,850
Speaker 0: So now that is brilliant cuz they just give them some accessories and shit for their iPhone.

265
00:19:25,492 --> 00:19:28,786
Speaker 1: Not even then you know that those people are gonna spend more than $100 in the Apple store.

266
00:19:30,513 --> 00:19:33,086
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you know you go in the Apple store with $100 in credit.

267
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:33,870
Speaker 0: What are you gonna?

268
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:42,350
Speaker 0: Buy you could buy some accessories But like you buy one accessory is like $60 or $40 and then another one and then there's something left.

269
00:19:42,832 --> 00:19:44,783
Speaker 0: Or maybe you'll buy like that $80 keyboard.

270
00:19:44,803 --> 00:19:46,131
Speaker 0: then what he can do with the $20?

271
00:19:46,131 --> 00:19:51,010
Speaker 0: So you're gonna buy something you know it with $100 in the Apple store or on the Apple website.

272
00:19:51,572 --> 00:19:56,810
Speaker 0: It's pretty much impossible to spend all of it without going over in some way.

273
00:19:57,211 --> 00:20:01,727
Speaker 1: I just wonder if this specific move wasn't pre-planned from the start.

274
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:05,238
Speaker 1: charge X Reduce price X time later now.

275
00:20:05,258 --> 00:20:06,823
Speaker 1: I don't have a goodwill kind of.

276
00:20:07,104 --> 00:20:08,810
Speaker 1: hey we care about our customers so much.

277
00:20:09,071 --> 00:20:22,179
Speaker 0: I don't think that the it was planned from the start because He sort of You know messed up the marketing of it and that if the rebate was planned He would have mentioned it when he announced the iPhone.

278
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:25,390
Speaker 0: all right and what's happened now is because he didn't mention.

279
00:20:25,653 --> 00:20:27,250
Speaker 0: Or I guess he came up with the rebate.

280
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:34,530
Speaker 0: You know later like the next day or after his you know little you know presentation is that all the news stories are?

281
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:36,990
Speaker 0: Concentrating on oh man iPhone price drop.

282
00:20:37,010 --> 00:20:46,715
Speaker 0: They're totally giving the finger to all the early adopters And they didn't concentrate on all of Apple's new iPods and things and That didn't work out too Well for Apple they should have.

283
00:20:47,137 --> 00:20:50,510
Speaker 0: if they had planned it in advance they would have been smart enough to mention the rebate.

284
00:20:50,891 --> 00:20:56,350
Speaker 0: You know when during the presentation which would have helped them out a lot, so about those new iPods.

285
00:20:56,973 --> 00:20:57,637
Speaker 0: So what they do?

286
00:20:57,677 --> 00:20:58,784
Speaker 0: they I think the shuffle.

287
00:20:58,925 --> 00:20:59,810
Speaker 0: does it have new colors?

288
00:20:59,930 --> 00:21:00,211
Speaker 0: Maybe?

289
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:00,693
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

290
00:21:00,713 --> 00:21:01,937
Speaker 0: I didn't even look doesn't matter.

291
00:21:02,318 --> 00:21:06,050
Speaker 0: the nano is now shorter and fatter, but much thinner.

292
00:21:06,271 --> 00:21:10,126
Speaker 0: I guess it's stupidly thin, but it can now do videos and everything.

293
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:13,690
Speaker 1: I am excited But at the same time I'd have to buy a new mount for my car.

294
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:18,502
Speaker 0: Yeah They the iPod Classic is sort of the same as the iPod.

295
00:21:18,542 --> 00:21:21,094
Speaker 0: the normal iPod has always been except It's now.

296
00:21:21,214 --> 00:21:24,249
Speaker 0: I think you can get it with like a hundred and sixty gigs or something ludicrous like that.

297
00:21:24,752 --> 00:21:27,569
Speaker 0: But I heard a rumor that it was sort of laggy like using it.

298
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,446
Speaker 0: huh and the interfaces on the nano and the classic are sort of improved to be more iPhone.

299
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:37,019
Speaker 0: ish with like the albums that go Swoosh and everything, but it's not a touchscreen.

300
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:37,883
Speaker 0: It's the same disc.

301
00:21:38,104 --> 00:21:38,847
Speaker 0: We're used to.

302
00:21:38,887 --> 00:21:40,488
Speaker 1: you know that's fine We're a regular iPod.

303
00:21:40,710 --> 00:21:42,157
Speaker 1: I don't think I'd want the touchscreen right.

304
00:21:42,237 --> 00:21:49,669
Speaker 0: just get in my way and distract and then they've got the iPod touch Which was almost I almost cared about it, so did we ever get an answer?

305
00:21:49,689 --> 00:21:49,729
Speaker 1: uh?

306
00:21:50,970 --> 00:21:52,196
Speaker 0: No, actually.

307
00:21:52,376 --> 00:21:54,727
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure the answer is no, but there's no.

308
00:21:54,747 --> 00:21:56,354
Speaker 0: yet There's no abs.

309
00:21:56,435 --> 00:21:59,650
Speaker 0: I have not seen any actual full-on confirmation.

310
00:21:59,831 --> 00:22:05,794
Speaker 0: Basically the iPod touch is an iPhone without the phone and it's like $300.

311
00:22:05,794 --> 00:22:15,284
Speaker 0: I think you can get it at 8 or 16 gigs or something like that right with flash and The news stories I keep seeing about it are oh man it.

312
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:16,166
Speaker 0: you know.

313
00:22:16,187 --> 00:22:18,573
Speaker 0: they took out the add Contact button.

314
00:22:18,653 --> 00:22:20,177
Speaker 0: you know you know to sort of.

315
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:22,423
Speaker 0: they basically took things out of it.

316
00:22:22,643 --> 00:22:27,430
Speaker 0: all right feature wise out of the software to Differentiate it from the iPhone itself.

317
00:22:27,892 --> 00:22:33,394
Speaker 0: It's like there's a the device the hardware that can consists in the iPhone The not the iPhone.

318
00:22:33,414 --> 00:22:36,525
Speaker 0: the iPod touch is capable of ludicrous things.

319
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:42,810
Speaker 0: it could do amazing things But it doesn't because Apple has decided to just you know put the software in there.

320
00:22:42,951 --> 00:22:46,897
Speaker 0: So it only does certain things Mostly what an iPod does plus a little bit more.

321
00:22:46,997 --> 00:22:56,450
Speaker 1: see the thing the one product that I've said this before I was waiting for And I would pay a lot of money for Some sort of portable mp3 player with Wi-Fi.

322
00:22:56,691 --> 00:23:08,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, the iPod touch has Wi-Fi that I could just run iTunes on and just get my podcast from wherever yep and this Touch had that I'd pay almost a thousand dollars for it possibly and it but it does.

323
00:23:08,505 --> 00:23:10,091
Speaker 0: as far as we know it doesn't have That.

324
00:23:10,131 --> 00:23:21,999
Speaker 0: what it does have is you can go on the iTunes store through this iTunes Wi-Fi interface they give you which is also going to be available in the iPhone and You Can buy songs you know like.

325
00:23:22,019 --> 00:23:24,490
Speaker 0: you can search for an artist and then it'll show you their albums.

326
00:23:24,591 --> 00:23:30,867
Speaker 0: You could touch the album with your finger and download the album But so far there is no indication that it can get podcasts.

327
00:23:30,887 --> 00:23:33,575
Speaker 0: the only device I know of that is Wi-Fi.

328
00:23:33,595 --> 00:23:39,636
Speaker 0: that can get podcasts is the PSP which I would buy for that feature if it wasn't so goddamn Big.

329
00:23:40,102 --> 00:23:40,669
Speaker 0: it's huge.

330
00:23:42,452 --> 00:23:46,190
Speaker 0: Even the new thin one is still as wide said this gigantic screen.

331
00:23:46,270 --> 00:23:50,063
Speaker 0: I don't need that screen to freaking listen to stuff all right.

332
00:23:50,183 --> 00:23:53,455
Speaker 0: I don't need this UMD drive on there It's it's too much.

333
00:23:53,496 --> 00:23:54,701
Speaker 0: It doesn't fulfill the purpose.

334
00:23:54,942 --> 00:24:00,628
Speaker 1: see I think what Apple's going for here Is people are out on the go and they're in a hot spot or whatever it.

335
00:24:00,709 --> 00:24:03,289
Speaker 1: suddenly They want to hear a song like they just start thinking about a song.

336
00:24:04,113 --> 00:24:07,529
Speaker 1: Now they can get the impulse buy market out there and not just at home.

337
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:10,090
Speaker 0: yep And also what it does is when you get back home.

338
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:23,744
Speaker 0: If you sync with your iTunes it will take any songs you bought on your iPod touch or your iPhone and put them In your iTunes, I wouldn't be surprised if there was some sort of dual marketing thing where in major urban areas They start doing thing.

339
00:24:23,824 --> 00:24:24,891
Speaker 1: I can think of a lot of ways They could.

340
00:24:24,911 --> 00:24:28,990
Speaker 0: well they have a thing in Starbucks where you can buy the song that's currently playing in the Starbucks.

341
00:24:29,191 --> 00:24:33,082
Speaker 1: Yeah, I expect a lot more things like that, and I if I were them.

342
00:24:33,163 --> 00:24:39,083
Speaker 1: I'd actually go around to all sorts of businesses and Pay them to play certain songs.

343
00:24:39,143 --> 00:24:47,179
Speaker 1: that I think would be I don't know impulse buys for the target demographic of said stores Maybe but just to you know reiterate again.

344
00:24:47,199 --> 00:24:47,801
Speaker 0: Oh first.

345
00:24:47,862 --> 00:24:55,050
Speaker 0: Oh, there's one other small thing which I'll get to but they The not supporting podcasting as much as it could be supported.

346
00:24:55,331 --> 00:24:59,387
Speaker 0: We just talked about how podcasts aren't so big and they could be.

347
00:24:59,407 --> 00:25:07,270
Speaker 0: the problem Is the people who make the technology that could bring podcasting into the into the fold are not making that technology.

348
00:25:07,692 --> 00:25:10,443
Speaker 0: The Zune could sync up and download podcasts.

349
00:25:10,564 --> 00:25:14,682
Speaker 0: it has all the hardware to do that But it doesn't just cuz no one made the software for it.

350
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:17,077
Speaker 0: the iPod touch could do it But it doesn't.

351
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:18,449
Speaker 0: a trio could do it.

352
00:25:18,751 --> 00:25:19,152
Speaker 0: It doesn't.

353
00:25:19,735 --> 00:25:27,445
Speaker 0: any portable device with Wi-Fi could have a podcatcher That was all slick and could just synchronize podcasts wherever you are.

354
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:37,274
Speaker 0: so a new episodes come out there They appear could even notify you that new episodes are out And you could listen to them on the device and delete them from the device and not have any Synchronizing or anything.

355
00:25:37,655 --> 00:25:39,462
Speaker 0: but no no one makes such a device now.

356
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:46,329
Speaker 1: one could say this is not my opinion But this is the kind of thing that you would see some guy on slashdot write a big paragraph about.

357
00:25:47,273 --> 00:26:06,870
Speaker 1: One could argue that perhaps the reason this doesn't this this is the way everything is is Simply that the current content producers are as always threatened by any sort of media or any sort of distribution method They can't control especially when said distribution method is full of free stuff made by people who aren't trying to make money.

358
00:26:07,833 --> 00:26:08,637
Speaker 0: And it could be.

359
00:26:09,018 --> 00:26:24,323
Speaker 1: one could say if one were a conspiracy theorist that perhaps The people who have some sort of influence over Microsoft and Apple you know people like EMI or other content Distributors or content owners might be really downplaying or keeping down.

360
00:26:24,343 --> 00:26:26,970
Speaker 1: I'm not podcasting, but just any sort of open media.

361
00:26:27,977 --> 00:26:34,487
Speaker 0: Or you could also say that hey You know the iPod touch right let's say it did have a podcatcher right.

362
00:26:34,808 --> 00:26:38,369
Speaker 0: it had let you Synchronize your podcast on the device just like I want.

363
00:26:39,371 --> 00:26:41,800
Speaker 0: How many sales would that really get them above and beyond?

364
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,664
Speaker 0: sure we give my say.

365
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,330
Speaker 0: you know what rim sale even if it got?

366
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:49,670
Speaker 1: Every listen every person in the world who listens to podcasts right now immediately went out and bought one.

367
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,308
Speaker 1: That's a drop in the bucket of how many people are gonna buy an iPod touch.

368
00:26:54,509 --> 00:26:58,901
Speaker 0: Yeah It's really not enough for them to take that into account.

369
00:26:58,961 --> 00:27:04,275
Speaker 0: when in you know making a business decision remember Apple much like Nintendo Above all else.

370
00:27:04,315 --> 00:27:10,880
Speaker 1: you can't forget no matter how much you like a company that they just want your money and They both do the same kind of thing of release.

371
00:27:11,061 --> 00:27:13,470
Speaker 1: just enough to get the majority of people.

372
00:27:13,651 --> 00:27:17,462
Speaker 0: Why should they spend their time and money developing more software for a device?

373
00:27:18,063 --> 00:27:20,049
Speaker 0: if that saw you know if they spend?

374
00:27:20,049 --> 00:27:30,488
Speaker 0: $20,000 paying a guy to work on software for half his for half a year right he's a $40,000 your employee to make one more application for the iPod touch.

375
00:27:30,509 --> 00:27:36,149
Speaker 0: and Then how many iPod touches they have to sell to make up for that guy's salary?

376
00:27:36,229 --> 00:27:40,710
Speaker 1: yeah I mean iPods don't sell because of podcasting they sell because of iPods.

377
00:27:41,202 --> 00:27:46,108
Speaker 1: Yep Right so don't get away from that unless you have anything else pertinent to say.

378
00:27:46,128 --> 00:27:56,369
Speaker 0: no The only other thing is I. it's sort of a chicken and egg in a way where if they started pushing The the podcasting onto the iPhones and on to the zooms and things and he actually caught on.

379
00:27:56,913 --> 00:28:00,297
Speaker 0: Then by making podcast device You know it's like they could create.

380
00:28:00,418 --> 00:28:02,891
Speaker 0: they could help create the market to make more money But at the

381
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:03,434
Speaker 1: same time

382
00:28:03,454 --> 00:28:04,840
Speaker 0: and saying there is no market the

383
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:10,399
Speaker 1: moment the market actually exists in Podcasting or syndicated anything like that starts to really take off

384
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:11,321
Speaker 0: then

385
00:28:11,542 --> 00:28:14,189
Speaker 1: everyone else like Microsoft will just jump right in

386
00:28:14,389 --> 00:28:18,067
Speaker 0: yep And the Sansa will even have Wi-Fi and let us get podcasts on and everything.

387
00:28:18,127 --> 00:28:20,054
Speaker 0: so yeah Oh, and you can.

388
00:28:20,516 --> 00:28:24,570
Speaker 0: you can now turn any song you buy in the iTunes music store into a ringtone.

389
00:28:24,650 --> 00:28:26,117
Speaker 1: Do you see that for a dollar?

390
00:28:26,277 --> 00:28:29,230
Speaker 1: that's brilliant marketing, and they're gonna make so much money off that.

391
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:41,480
Speaker 0: But you see someone hacked it all the thing is what happened was is someone realized hey if I just rename this you know M4a file or AAC file to be like M Like are something right.

392
00:28:41,861 --> 00:28:42,383
Speaker 0: then it will.

393
00:28:42,584 --> 00:28:46,230
Speaker 0: iTunes will think it's a ringtone And it'll just work and I won't have to pay a dollar.

394
00:28:46,851 --> 00:28:50,482
Speaker 0: But then the iTunes upgrade came through you know to Matt.

395
00:28:50,503 --> 00:28:58,270
Speaker 0: you know because every time they bring out new iPods They upgrade iTunes to work with the new iPods and that hack that trick didn't work anymore.

396
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,634
Speaker 0: So I guess they thought of that.

397
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:06,904
Speaker 1: yeah, well what I'll say very simply is that while from a money-making perspective It's brilliant to sell people their own songs again.

398
00:29:07,004 --> 00:29:11,788
Speaker 0: Just to be well They're not telling you the song again is they're saying it's a. you know you add a dollar to the.

399
00:29:12,009 --> 00:29:19,979
Speaker 1: yeah So you have to buy the song again for a dollar and ringtone form effectively yep That's basically paying a dollar to rename a file.

400
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:24,882
Speaker 1: the fact that the phone doesn't let you just make any file You want a ringtone is kind of shit it is.

401
00:29:24,923 --> 00:29:29,339
Speaker 0: That's just a really there is no Technological reason that it couldn't just do that.

402
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:34,341
Speaker 0: for you know that it doesn't cost Apple any resources whatsoever.

403
00:29:34,604 --> 00:29:41,310
Speaker 1: what it does Is it cost them the opportunity cost of the millions of people who are gonna pay a dollar to get a ringtone?

404
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,654
Speaker 0: That's what it does do.

405
00:29:42,695 --> 00:29:50,020
Speaker 1: so I guess it's smart of Apple to do that to make money and also same time Really shitty of Apple to do technically the record companies.

406
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:58,530
Speaker 0: that the way the royalty works is they yeah charge again When a song is used for as a ringtone because it gets played in public and all sorts of crap.

407
00:30:00,339 --> 00:30:01,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're not gonna get into that.

408
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:06,768
Speaker 0: It's like you buy a song and now I can't use that recording of the song that I purchased.

409
00:30:06,828 --> 00:30:10,442
Speaker 0: in any way I want I can only use it in certain ways and fucking right.

410
00:30:10,482 --> 00:30:27,785
Speaker 1: so an actual science news news being in quotation marks here Russia The has claimed that they have discovered a magical mythical mineral in the Arctic somewhere that just Somehow removes radiation from water-based solutions.

411
00:30:28,046 --> 00:30:34,138
Speaker 0: all right all right Let's not even because I don't want to say Not even what do they mean remove?

412
00:30:34,198 --> 00:30:35,201
Speaker 0: Where does it go?

413
00:30:35,401 --> 00:30:37,287
Speaker 1: Let's not even get into the scientific.

414
00:30:37,568 --> 00:30:38,150
Speaker 0: Oh come on.

415
00:30:38,932 --> 00:30:47,410
Speaker 1: I would just like to point out that stories like this come out of Russia a lot Lately and They're almost always bullshit.

416
00:30:47,732 --> 00:30:58,002
Speaker 1: There was the one a while ago about they brought those dogs back to life And it was totally fake and there was no actual thing that was Australian Yeah, but that Australian article linked to a Russian study.

417
00:30:58,062 --> 00:31:08,306
Speaker 1: I'm not sure there's a bunch of crap like that And it seems like a lot of this is going hand in hand with Russia's kind of attempting to Remilitarize even though that's basically just a joke.

418
00:31:08,386 --> 00:31:11,478
Speaker 1: and yeah Russia's trying to make itself look like it's very important.

419
00:31:11,638 --> 00:31:15,390
Speaker 1: and this I think is just a straight-up lie on the behalf of Russia.

420
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,213
Speaker 0: Oh, it's definitely a lie.

421
00:31:16,233 --> 00:31:18,921
Speaker 0: I mean where do they say the radiation goes?

422
00:31:18,941 --> 00:31:25,590
Speaker 0: no, but I don't think this is just oh we found Because I don't want to get into that, but it's I tech day.

423
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,102
Speaker 0: I don't want to talk about politics and in foreign stuff.

424
00:31:28,143 --> 00:31:29,570
Speaker 0: I want to talk about the science and the tech.

425
00:31:30,031 --> 00:31:40,250
Speaker 1: I think the science here is that in political science no the Russian government as I think that this is a straight-up hoax lie, and it's not even an accident or anything.

426
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:45,350
Speaker 1: It's just they are trying to convince the world that they are somehow still irrelevant.

427
00:31:46,030 --> 00:31:47,656
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but now great.

428
00:31:47,676 --> 00:31:49,703
Speaker 1: There's no way such a thing were true.

429
00:31:50,265 --> 00:31:51,730
Speaker 1: That would revolutionize the world.

430
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:55,222
Speaker 1: that would be one of the most amazing advances in possible.

431
00:31:55,282 --> 00:32:03,430
Speaker 1: because then we have a solution to the Problem of nuclear waste and yeah, we just take this mineral and like you know make a nuclear reactor out of it.

432
00:32:03,530 --> 00:32:06,390
Speaker 1: And then holy crap that's all I have to say about that.

433
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,655
Speaker 0: It's just yeah.

434
00:32:07,695 --> 00:32:11,310
Speaker 1: have such the audacity to lie openly about something like that.

435
00:32:11,431 --> 00:32:13,350
Speaker 1: I'd hundred percent doubt that this is true.

436
00:32:13,410 --> 00:32:14,032
Speaker 0: I mean think about it.

437
00:32:14,052 --> 00:32:17,304
Speaker 0: if something absorbs or gets rid of radiation well has to go somewhere.

438
00:32:17,345 --> 00:32:18,429
Speaker 0: does it go become heat?

439
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,610
Speaker 0: if That's the case it'll freaking start crazy fires, right?

440
00:32:22,110 --> 00:32:22,431
Speaker 0: Where does it?

441
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:23,233
Speaker 0: where else could it go?

442
00:32:23,293 --> 00:32:26,122
Speaker 0: it could turn into the mineral itself right.

443
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:28,629
Speaker 0: so I think it's our mineral grows as exposed.

444
00:32:29,110 --> 00:32:30,976
Speaker 1: I think it turns into communism.

445
00:32:31,096 --> 00:32:37,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, like as the mineral is exposed to radiation it starts to grow and turn red Matter to it.

446
00:32:37,945 --> 00:32:41,176
Speaker 0: turn it Superman if something's growing like that.

447
00:32:41,296 --> 00:32:45,146
Speaker 0: It's gonna become radioactive itself eventually, but it just doesn't work.

448
00:32:45,648 --> 00:32:46,470
Speaker 0: It makes no sense.

449
00:32:47,453 --> 00:32:53,610
Speaker 1: Like I said, I wasn't going to get into it, but I somewhat doubt the veracity of the claims of these Russian scientists.

450
00:32:54,072 --> 00:32:55,942
Speaker 0: All right, so there's a bunch of AMD news here.

451
00:32:56,223 --> 00:32:58,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's two big Start.

452
00:32:58,235 --> 00:33:00,249
Speaker 0: well, there's like two or three, but I'm gonna start out.

453
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:09,070
Speaker 0: AMD has come out with these like quad-core Opterons right and they're supposedly not so expensive, and they're supposedly wicked fast.

454
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:11,015
Speaker 0: And you know for a while.

455
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:13,583
Speaker 0: I thought ah AMD is going down.

456
00:33:13,603 --> 00:33:14,786
Speaker 0: They got there.

457
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:20,843
Speaker 0: You know the Intel's got the dual core the core two duos and AMD isn't keeping up.

458
00:33:21,284 --> 00:33:26,490
Speaker 0: and even though the AMD stuff is kind of cheap It's it's not really fast enough or reliable enough.

459
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:29,972
Speaker 0: But now they've got like this Opteron.

460
00:33:30,112 --> 00:33:32,679
Speaker 0: let's see what it is the Opteron two three five.

461
00:33:32,879 --> 00:33:38,136
Speaker 0: Oh, which is two gigahertz quad-core for 389 ha $389 and it's supposedly wicked fast.

462
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:43,483
Speaker 0: I don't know how it heats up or any or you know it's Pat.

463
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:43,985
Speaker 0: I'll see.

464
00:33:44,326 --> 00:33:55,089
Speaker 0: power efficiency I guess it's kind of average, but that's nothing to sneer at right there I mean granted a quad-core has almost no desktop uses That's true.

465
00:33:55,574 --> 00:34:08,650
Speaker 1: but for the server market that Like Scott said nothing to sneeze at because the server market is actually still in flux because desktop Whatever the high-end chip market AMD and Intel still both have very good offer.

466
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:17,737
Speaker 0: But at the same time if they're whipping out you know these quad cores and the $300 $400 for the server market Right the desktop ones man.

467
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,620
Speaker 0: They're gonna.

468
00:34:18,661 --> 00:34:19,784
Speaker 0: I think that's gonna be.

469
00:34:20,105 --> 00:34:23,797
Speaker 0: it's getting really tight basically Yeah, and it's tough to call.

470
00:34:24,018 --> 00:34:25,222
Speaker 1: I don't think they can.

471
00:34:25,723 --> 00:34:32,360
Speaker 1: they can't make faster dual cores They're basically just making quad cores at the speed They can make them which is great for the server market.

472
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,750
Speaker 0: supposedly they're gonna have like four gigahertz ones.

473
00:34:34,958 --> 00:34:39,445
Speaker 1: Yeah Don't forget right around then is when Intel's pen rins are gonna start coming out.

474
00:34:39,525 --> 00:34:40,789
Speaker 0: isn't the pen run what we have now?

475
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:42,234
Speaker 1: No The next.

476
00:34:42,275 --> 00:34:46,817
Speaker 0: the thing were that they Intel claimed that the I don't know the name I hate when people use those names.

477
00:34:46,837 --> 00:34:49,330
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure Henry and Scott is the next gen.

478
00:34:49,571 --> 00:34:55,809
Speaker 1: I have no idea that was when it's the current core to duo technology and core to quad just twice as fast.

479
00:34:56,452 --> 00:35:05,070
Speaker 0: Huh well who knows I'm not gonna bother to look up all those names right now, but yeah AMD whoa watch out it the CPU race is getting tight.

480
00:35:05,754 --> 00:35:14,766
Speaker 0: I think this is not the time to buy a computer And you should probably wait until like there's a period of time perhaps After the holiday season or during it when it's like.

481
00:35:14,786 --> 00:35:23,224
Speaker 1: ah yeah I mean I bought one because I had to and even then I bought my computer during a Plateau was a short plateau, but there was a plateau.

482
00:35:23,305 --> 00:35:28,223
Speaker 1: right when I bought my computer There was this plateau, and I knew that there was a steep increase coming.

483
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:33,350
Speaker 1: I figured by October late November There's gonna be a gigantic change in computing technology again.

484
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:35,581
Speaker 1: I just wasn't willing to wait that much longer.

485
00:35:35,601 --> 00:35:38,133
Speaker 0: in addition to that AMD.

486
00:35:38,153 --> 00:35:43,110
Speaker 0: all right you might know from many people yelling is that AMD's video drivers?

487
00:35:43,211 --> 00:35:43,814
Speaker 0: They kind of suck.

488
00:35:44,417 --> 00:35:46,750
Speaker 0: Nvidia's video card drivers are kind of awesome.

489
00:35:47,152 --> 00:35:48,578
Speaker 0: Intel's are okay.

490
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:49,643
Speaker 1: There's a lot of reasons for that.

491
00:35:49,663 --> 00:35:50,547
Speaker 1: We're not getting into it.

492
00:35:50,808 --> 00:35:53,515
Speaker 0: Nvidia's Technology is closed source.

493
00:35:53,555 --> 00:35:54,277
Speaker 0: It's all secret.

494
00:35:54,718 --> 00:35:59,970
Speaker 0: Intel's is not so open source, but they have their specifications online.

495
00:36:00,391 --> 00:36:09,820
Speaker 0: So it's pretty easy for the open source developers to make Intel video card drivers and for the most part They work really well without any sort of user Interaction.

496
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:17,901
Speaker 0: right ATI has had the problem where they were also closed source like Nvidia But the driver they made for Linux that was closed source sucked.

497
00:36:18,282 --> 00:36:20,229
Speaker 0: so pretty much all Linux people were just like.

498
00:36:20,369 --> 00:36:23,430
Speaker 0: alright We're pretty much only buying Nvidia and Intel cards.

499
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:31,249
Speaker 0: you know Nvidia when you need 3d Intel when you don't screw ATI and Anyone with ATI and Linux was just suffering and complaining.

500
00:36:31,309 --> 00:36:33,789
Speaker 1: well Yeah, you can listen to some old episodes where we had trouble.

501
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:43,422
Speaker 0: Against everyone's predictions and anyone's wildest dreams AMD has come out and said AMD slash ATI which is the same company.

502
00:36:43,462 --> 00:36:55,130
Speaker 0: now remember they came out and they said well We're gonna give you the specifications, but you get it to sign an NDA now, and they said wait actually no forget about the NDA We're just gonna put out enough specifications.

503
00:36:55,853 --> 00:37:02,518
Speaker 0: So people will just be able to make open source video drivers for The ATI cards.

504
00:37:03,362 --> 00:37:04,186
Speaker 0: and it's suddenly ATI.

505
00:37:05,471 --> 00:37:12,470
Speaker 0: AMD in like an hour in like a second has gone from being you're the enemy of the Linux world to we love you.

506
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:13,839
Speaker 0: Fuck Nvidia ha ha.

507
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,590
Speaker 1: now part of the reason for that.

508
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,518
Speaker 1: I mean even Nvidia solution.

509
00:37:17,599 --> 00:37:22,315
Speaker 1: while the drivers were closed source at least Nvidia worked Relatively well with.

510
00:37:22,416 --> 00:37:27,915
Speaker 1: you know open source stuff, and they they did as well as you could expect And they did have Nvidia people.

511
00:37:27,976 --> 00:37:33,835
Speaker 0: they do have Nvidia employees working on the kernel and other open source stuff to make sure that their Driver works.

512
00:37:33,975 --> 00:37:44,430
Speaker 1: the issue was that right about now While generally I still I've always thought that envy like the Nvidia side of technology was generally more robust.

513
00:37:44,591 --> 00:37:49,550
Speaker 1: But ATI very recently their high-end cards are a little faster than Nvidia's high-end.

514
00:37:49,631 --> 00:37:50,841
Speaker 0: Well the cards have all.

515
00:37:50,882 --> 00:38:03,910
Speaker 0: it's always been close You know the high-end cards versus the high-end cards and the price performance has gone back between unlike AMD Intel where Intel always sort of was down on the price performance ratio even if they were up on the performance.

516
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:14,210
Speaker 0: ATI and Nvidia have always been pretty close on the price performance ratios You know and the high-end cards from both companies have always been stupidly overpriced and no reason to buy them.

517
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,901
Speaker 0: But I guess just at this moment in time.

518
00:38:16,941 --> 00:38:34,824
Speaker 0: I think ATI is a little up with what their HD something whatever cards and They also like the latest ATI closed source drivers Right are suddenly catching up to the performance of the Nvidia drivers and Linux like they're not quite there But they're actually not as bad as they were.

519
00:38:34,844 --> 00:38:35,689
Speaker 0: they used to be useless.

520
00:38:35,749 --> 00:38:46,089
Speaker 0: now They're kind of and they're open source and well They're not open sourcing But they're opening the spec for open source people to look at to be able to make better open source drivers.

521
00:38:46,309 --> 00:38:51,370
Speaker 1: now I predict that Nvidia within six months is going to do something similar.

522
00:38:51,390 --> 00:39:02,950
Speaker 0: They're gonna have to do something because if an open source driver for ATI cards comes out You know for you know how many Linux nerds are gonna jump on that and make it better as fast as they can.

523
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:12,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's already some people who are working on this nouveau project Which is a project to make an Nvidia driver that is completely open source.

524
00:39:12,765 --> 00:39:16,275
Speaker 1: now one step further if I was in video I would tap those people.

525
00:39:16,356 --> 00:39:21,530
Speaker 0: yes, but what's happened is Nvidia is basically not going to help or hinder them in any way.

526
00:39:22,012 --> 00:39:24,762
Speaker 1: I think they're gonna change their tune as time goes on.

527
00:39:25,345 --> 00:39:38,196
Speaker 0: if they don't change their tune I do foresee that you know basically as soon as a driver comes out That's open source for ATI cards that works and is awesome Which I imagine will take Six to twelve months before it's.

528
00:39:38,276 --> 00:39:43,254
Speaker 0: it's at a point where people are using it and it when it's included in an Ubuntu release Is the moment.

529
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:45,890
Speaker 1: basically now this is this whole market shift.

530
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:48,850
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't want to go into much more detail because we could talk about this forever.

531
00:39:49,492 --> 00:40:01,401
Speaker 1: I think that what we're whatever we see happen in the next six months to a year because of all this is Going to be one of the first really good indicators of just how important Linux is on the desktop scene.

532
00:40:01,441 --> 00:40:11,870
Speaker 1: because if suddenly ATI sales start going up at a Noticeable rate then there's no way they can claim anything other than that's because Linux people stop buying Nvidia.

533
00:40:12,211 --> 00:40:23,730
Speaker 0: yeah, because the basically the rate of buying video cards is sort of unchanging and they make their profits and all the people who keep Buying the hottest new video card no matter what constantly because they're crazy stupid gamers who don't know any better.

534
00:40:23,831 --> 00:40:26,270
Speaker 1: So now we're gonna find out how many of those people do a boot.

535
00:40:26,712 --> 00:40:35,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they like also to make most of their money in you know The direct sales like if Dell decides to put Nvidia cards in the chips in their computers.

536
00:40:35,491 --> 00:40:37,130
Speaker 0: That's where Nvidia makes its big money.

537
00:40:37,150 --> 00:40:39,733
Speaker 0: If you know I guess gateway doesn't.

538
00:40:40,074 --> 00:40:44,890
Speaker 0: if Toshiba decides or HP to put ATI cards in a line of PCs.

539
00:40:45,072 --> 00:40:46,649
Speaker 0: That's where ATI makes all their money.

540
00:40:47,171 --> 00:40:53,590
Speaker 0: So any difference, you know that this will cause is gonna be in the in the gamer market and the nerd market.

541
00:40:53,730 --> 00:40:57,303
Speaker 0: So we're gonna figure out just how much of the nerd market is Linux.

542
00:40:57,343 --> 00:41:03,785
Speaker 0: people by looking at the difference in How ATI's sales increase because they will increase if ATI.

543
00:41:03,865 --> 00:41:14,890
Speaker 0: if Nvidia doesn't do anything I guarantee it that over the next two years ATI will see sales go up and the Nvidia will see sales go down if the open-source ATI driver comes out and is working.

544
00:41:15,251 --> 00:41:17,721
Speaker 1: Yep, but I mean there's a chance that there won't be.

545
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:19,387
Speaker 1: it'll just be a blip and no one will notice.

546
00:41:19,427 --> 00:41:21,677
Speaker 1: in which case we know That no one actually cares about Linux.

547
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:24,590
Speaker 0: in which case then why doesn't Nvidia open source?

548
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:27,920
Speaker 0: It's not gonna hurt them if it sales aren't gonna change.

549
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:28,702
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

550
00:41:28,722 --> 00:41:29,444
Speaker 0: I don't understand.

551
00:41:29,464 --> 00:41:31,390
Speaker 1: I will I never understood.

552
00:41:31,711 --> 00:41:34,902
Speaker 1: I mean, what could the driver have in it?

553
00:41:35,183 --> 00:41:37,350
Speaker 1: That would be such a trade secret.

554
00:41:38,193 --> 00:41:38,574
Speaker 0: It's it's.

555
00:41:38,715 --> 00:41:43,170
Speaker 0: it is written really well, you know, and I imagine there are some algorithms or technique.

556
00:41:43,511 --> 00:41:43,933
Speaker 1: You know what.

557
00:41:43,973 --> 00:41:50,443
Speaker 1: now that I may be patented just now my my broad guess not about technology But just look at the history.

558
00:41:50,503 --> 00:42:01,610
Speaker 1: for the longest time ATI's drivers for their own cards even when the cards were technologically superior Were kind of crappy and there were a lot of times where the driver alone was hindering the performance of an ATI card.

559
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:04,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, meanwhile Nvidia's always had really good drivers.

560
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:05,995
Speaker 0: I think Nvidia.

561
00:42:06,015 --> 00:42:10,730
Speaker 1: the reason they stayed back from this for so long was just that they didn't want ATI to pick up any tricks.

562
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:13,293
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, well I think they would.

563
00:42:13,313 --> 00:42:14,798
Speaker 0: they would be really smart to do.

564
00:42:14,979 --> 00:42:20,779
Speaker 0: right is if they open source their driver on Windows, too Because you know if why.

565
00:42:20,959 --> 00:42:21,180
Speaker 0: you know.

566
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,496
Speaker 0: think about how much money Nvidia spends on Making their driver.

567
00:42:24,516 --> 00:42:26,710
Speaker 0: not much ATI spends on making their driver.

568
00:42:27,372 --> 00:42:30,022
Speaker 0: These people out there will make your driver for you.

569
00:42:30,062 --> 00:42:37,990
Speaker 0: just open source it and these random people Will keep maintaining it and they already don't give any warranty for their driver, right?

570
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:48,310
Speaker 0: All they need to do is have like a couple guys to let you know Just keep putting the spec out for the new chips so that the new features on the new chips You know will be put into the driver on time.

571
00:42:48,370 --> 00:42:54,721
Speaker 0: Maybe hire a guy to make sure that the driver keeps pace with the you know the chip development features and such.

572
00:42:55,184 --> 00:43:03,837
Speaker 0: but other than that why bother paying developers to maintain these drivers when people out there will do it for free and Essentially make the same product.

573
00:43:03,857 --> 00:43:05,666
Speaker 0: They could save a lot of money doing that.

574
00:43:06,209 --> 00:43:11,710
Speaker 1: Oh well Yeah, but regardless this is good news, and I really want to see what comes of it in the next six months.

575
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:13,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, my bike plus am I paying ATI.

576
00:43:14,362 --> 00:43:14,805
Speaker 1: I might well.

577
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:17,713
Speaker 1: I just bought a high Didn't?

578
00:43:17,814 --> 00:43:18,156
Speaker 0: I didn't?

579
00:43:18,337 --> 00:43:20,230
Speaker 0: you didn't I didn't like so I did.

580
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:27,572
Speaker 0: I just bought an Nvidia card but in two or three years about when this thing will be set and done is the next time I'll make a move.

581
00:43:27,692 --> 00:43:29,116
Speaker 0: and whoa who knows?

582
00:43:29,618 --> 00:43:42,350
Speaker 1: so in somewhat less good news in fact possibly bad news from slash out here as of September 1st the free XML TV guide service at zap to it labs Has shut its doors due to misuse issues and all.

583
00:43:43,234 --> 00:43:46,889
Speaker 0: Let me let me explain this to people so you understand what the story is.

584
00:43:47,472 --> 00:43:49,159
Speaker 0: Let's say you use myth TV.

585
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:51,428
Speaker 0: myth TV is basically and free TiVo.

586
00:43:51,649 --> 00:43:52,452
Speaker 1: yes Leave it at that.

587
00:43:52,592 --> 00:44:02,890
Speaker 0: instead of getting a TiVo you get a computer you install Linux on it you install myth TV on that and Then now you have a computer that is a TiVo and you don't have to pay TiVo a monthly fee.

588
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:06,285
Speaker 1: Not only that it's better than TiVo because you can skip ads however you want.

589
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:07,792
Speaker 1: you're totally unrestricted Whatever.

590
00:44:07,812 --> 00:44:10,869
Speaker 0: you're basically using a PC instead of a TiVo you own it.

591
00:44:11,311 --> 00:44:16,130
Speaker 0: It only costs you the price of a PC because the software is free and there's no monthly fee and no nothing.

592
00:44:16,632 --> 00:44:21,230
Speaker 1: Myth TV is pretty easy to set up that unless it doesn't work on your hardware in which case just give up.

593
00:44:21,270 --> 00:44:25,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, you need to be if you buy a computer knowing you're gonna do myth TV with it.

594
00:44:25,785 --> 00:44:27,110
Speaker 0: It is not hard now.

595
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:34,067
Speaker 0: The only thing missing from the myth TV that the TiVo has is you need the TV listings right.

596
00:44:34,107 --> 00:44:38,084
Speaker 0: let's say I want to record Seinfeld right every episode of Seinfeld.

597
00:44:38,104 --> 00:44:43,630
Speaker 0: well on a TiVo I just go and I click on Seinfeld because it looks like a TV guide on the TV screen.

598
00:44:44,172 --> 00:44:46,761
Speaker 0: I click on Seinfeld and I say record all the Seinfeld's.

599
00:44:47,342 --> 00:44:54,386
Speaker 0: and it knows you know not to record two of the same episode of Seinfeld if it gets a rerun on the same day at like two different times.

600
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:57,697
Speaker 0: or it knows You know when Seinfeld is on.

601
00:44:57,738 --> 00:45:01,792
Speaker 0: it knows Seinfeld is on this channel at this time and this channel at this time and such And such and such.

602
00:45:02,013 --> 00:45:06,553
Speaker 1: I can just scroll through the directory and say I want to record that show and that show and that show And that show.

603
00:45:06,634 --> 00:45:08,870
Speaker 0: I don't need to know the times of the shows beforehand.

604
00:45:09,011 --> 00:45:11,730
Speaker 0: I don't need to have like a paper TV guide in front of me.

605
00:45:11,770 --> 00:45:16,807
Speaker 0: I don't need to type in like you know channel six at seven because that would be what's the point then?

606
00:45:16,968 --> 00:45:21,889
Speaker 1: right but The real problem is most of the services that give you this information are not free.

607
00:45:21,949 --> 00:45:22,632
Speaker 0: yet There is no.

608
00:45:22,672 --> 00:45:28,450
Speaker 0: if you set up a myth TV box the only thing hindering you is that how does this computer that you just set?

609
00:45:28,631 --> 00:45:30,620
Speaker 0: Up know when shows are on?

610
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,650
Speaker 0: are you gonna type your TV guide into it?

611
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:33,513
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

612
00:45:33,935 --> 00:45:44,854
Speaker 0: it needs to connect to some server somewhere that has the TV Listings and has to get the TV listings from that server and some company has to put the TV listings into that server and has To know where you live.

613
00:45:45,095 --> 00:45:46,521
Speaker 0: that's you know what channels you get.

614
00:45:46,802 --> 00:45:51,587
Speaker 0: it has to account for like satellite channels You know has to count for everything different time zones.

615
00:45:51,627 --> 00:46:06,147
Speaker 0: It's crazy It's a lot of data, and it's hard to manage and until now there was only one place You could get that information for free and that was zap to it And they would give you this information in XML form for free if you signed up and whatever.

616
00:46:06,628 --> 00:46:07,230
Speaker 0: and now they're good.

617
00:46:08,356 --> 00:46:09,188
Speaker 0: So what do you do?

618
00:46:10,231 --> 00:46:13,509
Speaker 0: You're gonna type in seven the hostage on channel three.

619
00:46:14,710 --> 00:46:16,396
Speaker 0: That it's really bad.

620
00:46:16,436 --> 00:46:17,179
Speaker 0: think about it though.

621
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:19,948
Speaker 0: all the information you can think of right is online.

622
00:46:19,968 --> 00:46:22,157
Speaker 0: the weather You know the time.

623
00:46:22,177 --> 00:46:25,170
Speaker 0: all the TV listings are not really online.

624
00:46:26,694 --> 00:46:27,863
Speaker 0: Are the TV listings online?

625
00:46:27,883 --> 00:46:28,528
Speaker 0: I've never seen them.

626
00:46:28,931 --> 00:46:29,755
Speaker 0: They're fine.

627
00:46:29,795 --> 00:46:31,905
Speaker 1: when was the last time you looked for a TV list?

628
00:46:31,945 --> 00:46:38,470
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look right now But I remember from the times when I did try to look for TV listings very hard to find online.

629
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:46,987
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, well I mean I think there's a bunch of issues here because a lot of the people on slashdot are basically railing against.

630
00:46:47,047 --> 00:46:48,973
Speaker 1: this is ah That's bullshit.

631
00:46:49,214 --> 00:46:54,170
Speaker 1: How dare those people giving me a free service decide to not bother giving me the free service anymore?

632
00:46:54,491 --> 00:47:07,534
Speaker 1: How dare they indeed and there's this this happens with other projects, too Just because people have been providing a service for free for a long time or for a short time for any amount of time and For whatever reason they stop.

633
00:47:08,016 --> 00:47:12,630
Speaker 1: a lot of people on the internet have this kind of sense of entitlement that hot it's mine.

634
00:47:12,771 --> 00:47:13,494
Speaker 1: They can't stop.

635
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:16,930
Speaker 1: they got to keep giving this to me and a lot of people are really mad about this.

636
00:47:17,030 --> 00:47:23,729
Speaker 1: But if someone's giving you something for free I really can't see any valid way to complain if they suddenly stop.

637
00:47:24,392 --> 00:47:27,223
Speaker 0: Alright TV guy calm has TV listings, but they're kind of ad.

638
00:47:27,264 --> 00:47:28,669
Speaker 0: they're not really all too useful.

639
00:47:29,271 --> 00:47:31,559
Speaker 0: And well the guys are like four pages to get to see.

640
00:47:31,579 --> 00:47:34,650
Speaker 1: the trick isn't getting the listings because that information is out there.

641
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:39,290
Speaker 1: The trick is getting the listings converting it into a form that myth TV can then understand.

642
00:47:39,771 --> 00:47:46,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, and companies like TiVo jealously guard their listings because well because they have to pay someone to provide them with a list.

643
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:49,970
Speaker 1: Well, not only that but that's one of the prime benefits you get for buying a TiVo.

644
00:47:50,111 --> 00:47:51,100
Speaker 1: Is that that all just works?

645
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:52,129
Speaker 1: You don't have to worry about it.

646
00:47:52,591 --> 00:47:55,983
Speaker 0: Yep, and I mean your cable company doesn't even want you to have the listings.

647
00:47:56,023 --> 00:47:59,343
Speaker 0: they cuz they show them on a channel that they Want you to watch because that channel has ads.

648
00:47:59,363 --> 00:48:06,230
Speaker 0: yeah I don't want you They don't want you to have TV guide cuz then you're not gonna go to the channel that has the ads and the listings on It.

649
00:48:06,973 --> 00:48:08,438
Speaker 0: so yeah, I don't know.

650
00:48:08,458 --> 00:48:12,190
Speaker 0: do you think another company is gonna just show up with XML TV listings?

651
00:48:12,590 --> 00:48:12,949
Speaker 1: I don't know.

652
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:19,470
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people are gonna start using various hackish Scrapers that'll go to websites scrape the information turn it to XML.

653
00:48:19,611 --> 00:48:23,490
Speaker 0: I just went to TV guide calm and it looks like not the trivial thing to scrape.

654
00:48:23,771 --> 00:48:28,150
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I was looking through some of the scrapers out there and they're just pearl monstrosities.

655
00:48:28,471 --> 00:48:32,805
Speaker 1: Yeah, and apparently they break often because people notice the scraping and fix it.

656
00:48:33,186 --> 00:48:34,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just.

657
00:48:35,275 --> 00:48:37,290
Speaker 0: It's bad news for myth TV users.

658
00:48:37,370 --> 00:48:42,670
Speaker 0: However, even if I had a myth TV, I wouldn't be using it as a DVR because I don't watch TV.

659
00:48:42,770 --> 00:48:44,073
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing The.

660
00:48:44,154 --> 00:48:53,310
Speaker 1: the core truth is simply that this information Does not really exist out there in a useful form for these people and it's not trivial to put the information in this useful form.

661
00:48:53,836 --> 00:49:03,250
Speaker 1: so the capitalist solution is to pay someone to put this information into the form for you or To do it yourself and pay for it with your own time and a lot of things.

662
00:49:03,350 --> 00:49:03,893
Speaker 0: I wonder.

663
00:49:03,913 --> 00:49:07,550
Speaker 0: like any of those I wonder how much the places that are non free, right?

664
00:49:07,630 --> 00:49:09,610
Speaker 0: There must be non free places to get this information.

665
00:49:10,471 --> 00:49:11,295
Speaker 1: I'm sure there are.

666
00:49:11,335 --> 00:49:14,910
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are cuz they'd like oh the last non free one is gone, right?

667
00:49:15,010 --> 00:49:19,990
Speaker 0: And I remember when I researched myth TV a year or so ago that there were non free alternatives.

668
00:49:20,434 --> 00:49:25,505
Speaker 1: I do wonder how much they charge because $15 for three months and they're hoping to change it to $20 a year.

669
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,440
Speaker 1: Is that what it says for one run by the myth TV?

670
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,409
Speaker 1: devs saw www.schedulestirect.org.

671
00:49:32,409 --> 00:49:34,379
Speaker 1: $20 a year.

672
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:44,384
Speaker 0: I was just about to say that if they charged outrageous prices that I would think about starting up a competitor to charge a non outrageous Price, but $15 for three months $20 a year.

673
00:49:44,404 --> 00:49:45,570
Speaker 0: Those are both reasonable price.

674
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:46,956
Speaker 0: You know what thing for that service?

675
00:49:47,096 --> 00:49:50,129
Speaker 0: I'd be willing to pay that if I was a TV watcher with a myth TV.

676
00:49:50,129 --> 00:49:51,977
Speaker 0: $20 a year $15 to three months.

677
00:49:53,651 --> 00:50:00,010
Speaker 0: You're still owning the price of a TiVo which is what like 20 a month at least probably more plus the cost of a TiVo.

678
00:50:00,531 --> 00:50:09,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, just the fact that a lot of people are complaining so loudly about the free thing going away when there is a perfectly reasonable Paid one out there.

679
00:50:09,094 --> 00:50:17,470
Speaker 1: It's kind of like the feet like I can see people's complaints when a CD cost You know 20 bucks and a crap CD in the discount bin cost seven bucks.

680
00:50:17,470 --> 00:50:25,330
Speaker 0: But it's like Skype was giving out the free phone calls, you know for a while and it's over now But you don't see anyone complaining because it was reasonable.

681
00:50:25,651 --> 00:50:30,950
Speaker 1: Imagine if a CD was a dollar fifty and a song in iTunes was five cents at that point.

682
00:50:31,331 --> 00:50:36,330
Speaker 1: I don't care how you know righteous and indignant you are when you start complaining and pirating stuff.

683
00:50:36,772 --> 00:50:40,710
Speaker 0: I would buy so much God if it was no DRM, I'd buy so much goddamn music.

684
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:43,570
Speaker 1: But you know people would still complain because they can't get it free anymore.

685
00:50:43,651 --> 00:50:51,133
Speaker 0: And then they those only people who would complain Would be people who didn't have jobs yet the college kids in the high school kids because they don't even have the nickel or the dollar Fifty.

686
00:50:51,496 --> 00:50:57,055
Speaker 0: and if I wasn't still a college or high school kid I would still be getting the music for free well even if it was a nickel a song.

687
00:50:57,095 --> 00:51:08,050
Speaker 1: the reason for that is simply that we went to our IT which had access to internet to And if any of you have never been on internet - it is nothing but mp3s and software stupidly fast.

688
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:12,370
Speaker 0: You can download like a gigabyte in a minute and the RIAA just can't get in there.

689
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,052
Speaker 0: so they get.

690
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:17,787
Speaker 0: but you know if it was a dollar fifty in album or fifty or like five cents a song.

691
00:51:17,807 --> 00:51:23,298
Speaker 0: and I Now I'm a person who has a job that pays money And I don't have a lot of time.

692
00:51:23,318 --> 00:51:28,870
Speaker 0: and I you know I like I have so many mp3s Just don't listen to because they've been sorted you know and it's such a pain.

693
00:51:28,950 --> 00:51:30,819
Speaker 0: I don't download music just because it's such a pain.

694
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,110
Speaker 1: I'd probably re-buy almost my entire collection.

695
00:51:33,170 --> 00:51:42,515
Speaker 0: I probably would just for the convenience of having it be sorted and correctly labeled and all that jazz I would go and buy like probably like $500 worth of music.

696
00:51:42,675 --> 00:51:51,570
Speaker 1: just let's see that proves the point that the information itself the mp3 files Even though you can go out and get it free Not that useful.

697
00:51:51,971 --> 00:51:57,587
Speaker 1: But people like us and I think a lot of people are willing to pay to get the information in a usable form.

698
00:51:57,627 --> 00:52:04,705
Speaker 1: the the process Of making the information usable is still marketable even if the information itself can be stolen.

699
00:52:04,966 --> 00:52:15,887
Speaker 0: because as free as Downloaded stealing and stealing mp3s is It's still inconvenient without even in the Napster days the Golden Age when Napster was full-on.

700
00:52:16,368 --> 00:52:20,161
Speaker 0: it was still Inconvenient compared to iTunes which is more convenient.

701
00:52:20,181 --> 00:52:22,930
Speaker 0: There is no doubt, and I'm willing to pay for convenience.

702
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:25,942
Speaker 0: I'm just only willing to pay about ten cents five cents.

703
00:52:26,384 --> 00:52:26,645
Speaker 0: You know.

704
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:32,570
Speaker 0: so you can make money Because you have the advantage of convenience on top of the product itself.

705
00:52:32,971 --> 00:52:40,189
Speaker 0: You just have to make the price so low that you know it makes up for the the inconvenience of downloading for free.

706
00:52:40,932 --> 00:52:42,117
Speaker 1: Alright, so I got another one here.

707
00:52:42,399 --> 00:52:45,010
Speaker 1: alright rim is really hungry and wants some Chinese food.

708
00:52:45,613 --> 00:52:48,146
Speaker 0: I got some more real ones right there real quick.

709
00:52:48,387 --> 00:52:51,203
Speaker 1: Let's be alright Let's just do a bam bam bam because I really want to eat.

710
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:55,602
Speaker 0: okay first BAM NTP pool reaches a thousand servers needs more.

711
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:57,409
Speaker 1: all right NTP is great.

712
00:52:59,015 --> 00:53:01,907
Speaker 1: I have words about implementing NTP, but that's beside the point.

713
00:53:02,329 --> 00:53:11,369
Speaker 0: yep The NTP pool is basically a bunch of people who set up their computers to keep track of time so that other people can synchronize their computers to have the correct time.

714
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:15,862
Speaker 0: and I encourage people who have spare computers to join.

715
00:53:15,902 --> 00:53:16,846
Speaker 0: have a computer.

716
00:53:16,906 --> 00:53:21,426
Speaker 0: join the NTP pool So that more computers on the internet can have correct time for free.

717
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:30,050
Speaker 1: in fact I'm thinking of when I build my new server in the house We're gonna have an external facing server with you know SFTP and all that business or idiot friends can send us files.

718
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:32,294
Speaker 1: I'm really thinking.

719
00:53:32,315 --> 00:53:33,642
Speaker 1: I'll just make it an NTP pool.

720
00:53:33,883 --> 00:53:34,426
Speaker 1: doesn't hurt me.

721
00:53:34,446 --> 00:53:38,964
Speaker 0: Yeah There's some guy who went missing and they're you see faucet.

722
00:53:39,004 --> 00:53:39,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, who is?

723
00:53:39,767 --> 00:53:40,370
Speaker 0: do you know about him?

724
00:53:40,410 --> 00:53:40,972
Speaker 0: I don't know about him.

725
00:53:41,013 --> 00:53:41,696
Speaker 0: I just I'm missing.

726
00:53:41,776 --> 00:53:42,860
Speaker 1: Here's what I know about him.

727
00:53:43,262 --> 00:53:45,130
Speaker 1: He is missing and the internet cares.

728
00:53:45,910 --> 00:53:47,721
Speaker 0: Yes, uh they're using amit.

729
00:53:47,762 --> 00:53:49,050
Speaker 0: the interesting thing isn't me?

730
00:53:49,090 --> 00:53:51,264
Speaker 0: I guess it's sad that he's missing even though I don't know anything about.

731
00:53:51,626 --> 00:54:04,130
Speaker 1: at the same time It's it while that said this illustrates a point because this happened before with the other guy went missing that Geeks on the internet even if they don't know a geek they'll use technology if they can to try and help each other.

732
00:54:04,792 --> 00:54:10,932
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like imagine if you know there was just another one of those you know sensationalized missing little girls Cases.

733
00:54:11,012 --> 00:54:16,888
Speaker 0: right they would not be using Amazon's mechanical Turk to find her you know because it's just.

734
00:54:17,149 --> 00:54:17,490
Speaker 0: they're not.

735
00:54:17,911 --> 00:54:20,882
Speaker 0: It's just the way the geek community is right now is it's you know?

736
00:54:20,902 --> 00:54:22,267
Speaker 0: the geeks are helping each other out.

737
00:54:22,328 --> 00:54:25,930
Speaker 0: people who are have A presence on the internet are getting helped by the internet.

738
00:54:26,232 --> 00:54:28,729
Speaker 0: You know when you give to the internet it sort of gives back to you.

739
00:54:28,850 --> 00:54:31,350
Speaker 0: You know you give to an internet community that community gives back.

740
00:54:31,872 --> 00:54:36,856
Speaker 0: So they're using Amazon's mechanical Turk to help find this guy And I guess it's sort of helping.

741
00:54:36,897 --> 00:54:39,890
Speaker 0: maybe if it actually finds the guy that'll be amazing.

742
00:54:39,950 --> 00:54:48,410
Speaker 1: well what they're doing is they're looking at small images from satellite photos taken recently and People just look at one and see if they see the wreckage of a plane.

743
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:50,421
Speaker 1: Hopefully they can narrow down where he is out there.

744
00:54:50,622 --> 00:55:01,369
Speaker 0: yep, and if someone says yes I think I see wreckage on this one and no I don't see any on this one then the Professionals look at the ones that people mark as yes And if they see something that they send a crew out there.

745
00:55:01,911 --> 00:55:07,490
Speaker 1: So there have been a bunch of stories about you know the old Amazon one-click shopping patent and the BS around that.

746
00:55:08,212 --> 00:55:23,335
Speaker 1: There's been a bunch of articles lately pointing out that the US patent and trademark office is Really starting to shape up when it comes to technology issues and one of the things they're looking at more and more closely is the possible Bullshittedness of this patent.

747
00:55:23,897 --> 00:55:26,985
Speaker 0: it's the most bullshitted patent ever and it's really one of the only.

748
00:55:27,165 --> 00:55:39,950
Speaker 0: I submit that the patent that may I'm just a behalf for IBM I'm just saying is that this is a pretty nefarious and infamous patent And it's one of the only evil things really there is about Amazon.

749
00:55:39,950 --> 00:55:49,049
Speaker 0: It was otherwise pretty nice in terms of internet companies And if it gets turned over then that marks like a new age for patent goodness instead of patent evil.

750
00:55:49,289 --> 00:55:49,430
Speaker 1: yep.

751
00:55:49,591 --> 00:55:53,378
Speaker 1: And also there's an article here Columnist it's on slashdot.

752
00:55:53,418 --> 00:56:01,864
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna bother with who wrote it, but it talks about Online relationships, and how people shouldn't just dismiss them as not being real because they're online.

753
00:56:01,904 --> 00:56:03,769
Speaker 1: and all I want to say is that I?

754
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:04,904
Speaker 1: think that's pretty obvious.

755
00:56:04,965 --> 00:56:14,950
Speaker 1: because regardless of if people see each other in person or whatever an Emotional relationship can happen in just about any format, and if you doubt that just go on live journal for like five minutes.

756
00:56:15,477 --> 00:56:30,710
Speaker 1: yeah, and There's a lot of cases coming up where you know people are married or dating and then someone has an emotional attachment with someone online And maybe there's significant other Dismisses this as not being real and that's only gonna lead to problems down the line.

757
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:36,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've heard I know of like two or three stories of you know two people married with kids.

758
00:56:36,892 --> 00:56:42,310
Speaker 0: One of the people who's married meet someone on the internet runs away, and that's the end or don't even run away.

759
00:56:42,410 --> 00:56:46,070
Speaker 1: But you know if they're really into it they get married in World of Warcraft.

760
00:56:46,472 --> 00:56:51,174
Speaker 1: And then that relationship becomes more important than the quote unquote real relationship.

761
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:56,013
Speaker 1: and if you care more about a person that you know online than someone you're living with then How?

762
00:56:56,113 --> 00:56:59,703
Speaker 1: who could say that one relationship is somehow more valid?

763
00:56:59,884 --> 00:57:01,990
Speaker 1: no even though the other one is more emotion.

764
00:57:02,050 --> 00:57:11,308
Speaker 0: I cannot say they're let more or less valid, but I can say that a Online relationship does have problems with it that real-world relationships do not.

765
00:57:11,368 --> 00:57:18,048
Speaker 0: for example You know there was a story recently like some guy who is like oh, it was actually someone.

766
00:57:18,168 --> 00:57:18,810
Speaker 1: he met the person.

767
00:57:18,951 --> 00:57:20,617
Speaker 0: You know you know it's like you don't really know.

768
00:57:20,678 --> 00:57:25,014
Speaker 0: it's like you got a. that's why I kind of like you know community Relationships on the internet.

769
00:57:25,054 --> 00:57:28,088
Speaker 0: you got like a forum, and then you actually meet the people in real life.

770
00:57:28,128 --> 00:57:29,897
Speaker 0: at some point It's like ah well at the same time.

771
00:57:29,937 --> 00:57:32,510
Speaker 1: I mean we don't have to say just a romantic relationship.

772
00:57:32,570 --> 00:57:33,355
Speaker 0: No, it could be.

773
00:57:33,375 --> 00:57:35,770
Speaker 1: you can have an emotional relationship with someone online.

774
00:57:35,870 --> 00:57:38,319
Speaker 1: I mean I back in the early days of.

775
00:57:38,419 --> 00:57:46,210
Speaker 0: but the same problems can happen where you don't you think you know about the person But really you only know you're having this emotional relationship with the online persona.

776
00:57:46,631 --> 00:58:00,688
Speaker 0: That is not necessarily the true person and there could be deception that does not really exist so much in Longer-term real-world relationships because it's hard for people to Put on such a fake persona unless they're like a con artist if you're actually sitting there next to them.

777
00:58:00,969 --> 00:58:12,595
Speaker 1: true I guess the point I want to make is just that a lot of people dismiss The social interaction online as not being real and not being worth worrying about and a lot of times That's real case.

778
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:13,339
Speaker 0: It's real.

779
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:15,350
Speaker 0: It just has a potential for deception.

780
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:16,736
Speaker 0: Do you want to do one more?

781
00:58:16,917 --> 00:58:18,625
Speaker 0: let the IBM open office?

782
00:58:18,685 --> 00:58:18,785
Speaker 1: Oh?

783
00:58:18,825 --> 00:58:18,986
Speaker 1: Yeah?

784
00:58:19,006 --> 00:58:19,810
Speaker 1: We should talk about that.

785
00:58:19,850 --> 00:58:26,290
Speaker 0: I think that'll be the last one all right, so IBM has been supporting the open document format, which I'm not gonna talk about that.

786
00:58:26,370 --> 00:58:30,209
Speaker 0: No, it's a whole show, but it's basically yay for not Microsoft.

787
00:58:30,752 --> 00:58:34,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's a whole other issue about how IBM has been going.

788
00:58:34,447 --> 00:58:47,347
Speaker 1: I mean when I worked there This was a really big trend and I actually was a big part of that and we got rid of a lot of Windows PCs but pushing and pushing toward Linux and open source and Internally just not being dependent upon other people's crap

789
00:58:47,689 --> 00:58:47,849
Speaker 0: yep.

790
00:58:48,512 --> 00:58:54,690
Speaker 0: So they're actually what they've decided now is they're going to put some developers to start working on open office.

791
00:58:54,770 --> 00:58:56,818
Speaker 0: So IBM people are gonna work in open office.

792
00:58:56,858 --> 00:59:02,510
Speaker 0: the same way IBM people work on eclipse and the first thing they're gonna Do is they're gonna sort of add this I?

793
00:59:03,510 --> 00:59:07,004
Speaker 0: Accessible to thing to the open document format and such.

794
00:59:07,065 --> 00:59:08,330
Speaker 1: yeah, we don't have to go over the details.

795
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:15,438
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically what they're gonna work on first is they're gonna make it so that if you're a blind or a debt I guess mostly blind but also deaf people.

796
00:59:15,478 --> 00:59:23,956
Speaker 0: Maybe I guess I think they have a problem with documents on computers They're gonna make it easier for blind people to use Open office.

797
00:59:23,997 --> 00:59:32,210
Speaker 0: so basically if this works out I see a lot of visually impaired people just drop in Microsoft Office and use open.

798
00:59:32,571 --> 00:59:48,810
Speaker 1: Oh, I gotta read between the lines that I think the reason they're doing that first because that generates a lot of good PR buzz A lot of charity buzz and that sort of thing because the in the corporate culture and IBM is actually very big on Charity and community work and things like that because we go.

799
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:52,022
Speaker 1: I mean good gets done, but it also makes the company look really good.

800
00:59:52,102 --> 01:00:03,103
Speaker 0: IBM donates a lot of money to charity Yeah, but technologically speaking this technology this I accessible to is actually interesting in that it's it's a technology It's not just you know helps read the screen to the to the blind person.

801
01:00:03,123 --> 01:00:03,846
Speaker 0: we have that already.

802
01:00:04,287 --> 01:00:13,810
Speaker 0: it helps read Text embedded in charts menus pictures pop-ups and hyperlinks, so it's actually really cool What it does and that's that's pretty advanced stuff right there.

803
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:18,803
Speaker 1: Yeah, but beyond that there I think the ulterior motive is that I mean IBM.

804
01:00:18,843 --> 01:00:29,967
Speaker 1: internally we use like Lotus and crap but really everyone just use word and Philosophically and realistically they don't want to have to keep upgrading and dealing with word and new versions.

805
01:00:30,007 --> 01:00:33,650
Speaker 0: if you're IBM Why do you want to pay Microsoft to have a word processor?

806
01:00:33,752 --> 01:00:34,569
Speaker 0: You don't want to do that.

807
01:00:34,630 --> 01:00:36,156
Speaker 0: That's just costing you money for nothing.

808
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:39,730
Speaker 1: and also IBM was putting a lot of money into Lotus and crap.

809
01:00:39,891 --> 01:00:55,564
Speaker 1: And you know one if they put the money into open office They get the same benefits in terms of the technology getting better that they get putting it into Lotus But they also get all the open stuff and they get the goodwill of the Linux community And they can you know push their Linux on people with.

810
01:00:55,604 --> 01:00:59,796
Speaker 1: look we contribute back and it's just a Situation for anyone, but Microsoft.

811
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:03,447
Speaker 0: and they can push out Microsoft who they don't like and Microsoft's not doing too.

812
01:01:03,487 --> 01:01:06,579
Speaker 0: Well with their Ooxml format they're trying to push.

813
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:08,490
Speaker 0: it keeps getting voted down all over the place.

814
01:01:08,510 --> 01:01:11,842
Speaker 1: There's reasons for that But we'll save that for that could be a whole show that one.

815
01:01:12,305 --> 01:01:15,337
Speaker 1: so up in other news Rim stomach just started rumbling.

816
01:01:15,437 --> 01:01:16,923
