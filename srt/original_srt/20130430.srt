1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,447
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday April 30th 2013.

2
00:00:10,447 --> 00:00:15,200
Speaker 0: I'm rib, I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,622 --> 00:00:18,140
Speaker 0: Monaco what's yours is mine.

4
00:00:20,862 --> 00:00:21,876
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:25,061 --> 00:00:25,785
Speaker 0: Aka the game.

6
00:00:25,825 --> 00:00:32,773
Speaker 1: We've been talking about since 2010 a game We already did an episode on when he interviewed the guy who made the game the game.

7
00:00:32,933 --> 00:00:50,039
Speaker 0: I have a bag of cut Sort of Jimmy cubic zirconias from Andy Schatz because we used our packs guest speaker privileges that we no longer get because they don't give that to people like they used to to get into the expo hall early And play Monaco and we won.

8
00:00:51,581 --> 00:00:53,468
Speaker 0: We interviewed Andy Schatz on geek nights.

9
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,153
Speaker 0: We got the game early.

10
00:00:55,234 --> 00:00:57,000
Speaker 1: I wonder if we think this game is any good.

11
00:00:57,080 --> 00:00:57,807
Speaker 0: Yeah, Monaco sucks.

12
00:00:57,848 --> 00:00:58,393
Speaker 0: Don't play it.

13
00:01:00,441 --> 00:01:10,196
Speaker 0: So, uh on the way to work today I was biking, you know biking to work like I do And I'm riding in the car lane because there's only one car lane and there's nowhere else to go.

14
00:01:10,216 --> 00:01:11,260
Speaker 0: cuz I'm there's no bike.

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,150
Speaker 1: Let's treat me this Manhattan Avenue.

16
00:01:13,431 --> 00:01:15,724
Speaker 1: Okay in Brooklyn in BK There's a.

17
00:01:15,845 --> 00:01:20,740
Speaker 0: it's basically a two-way street and then there's four lanes But two of them are parking lanes the van parked in the parking lane.

18
00:01:21,022 --> 00:01:23,180
Speaker 0: So I take the main lane and it's not much traffic.

19
00:01:23,521 --> 00:01:27,420
Speaker 0: This old man and a big old old man car pulls up behind me and starts honking.

20
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,010
Speaker 0: Mmm, I flip them off immediately because that's just what you do.

21
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:36,499
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not getting I'm not gonna stop and let you pass me Already going like 28 miles an hour so you can you can cool it.

22
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:44,679
Speaker 0: so then he honks and starts yelling something and pulls into oncoming traffic and Pulls up next to me and starts trying to yell at me.

23
00:01:45,343 --> 00:01:48,359
Speaker 0: so I look at him and I just flip him off and just keep going.

24
00:01:48,379 --> 00:01:51,492
Speaker 0: and He like starts to get really mad.

25
00:01:51,512 --> 00:01:54,203
Speaker 0: and before anything can happen a cop Pulls him over.

26
00:01:54,383 --> 00:01:58,274
Speaker 0: nice and I just kept going and I'm pretty sure he got a ticket the best.

27
00:01:58,495 --> 00:01:59,658
Speaker 0: I was very happy with that.

28
00:02:01,062 --> 00:02:01,786
Speaker 1: So that was my morning.

29
00:02:01,987 --> 00:02:04,039
Speaker 1: it would have been more exciting though if someone hit him head-on.

30
00:02:04,802 --> 00:02:09,699
Speaker 0: Perhaps another angry old that would have been exciting would have been less satisfying to me.

31
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:11,550
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it was another angry old man.

32
00:02:11,571 --> 00:02:12,999
Speaker 1: Like both of them were trying to honk at you.

33
00:02:14,582 --> 00:02:21,902
Speaker 0: But I always want sort of real objective justice in the sense of society as opposed to sort of Karmic.

34
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:25,672
Speaker 0: a dumb person was hurt because serendipitously another dumb person.

35
00:02:25,692 --> 00:02:25,973
Speaker 0: Yes.

36
00:02:26,133 --> 00:02:27,436
Speaker 1: Everyone wants justice.

37
00:02:27,456 --> 00:02:28,760
Speaker 1: It is the hardest thing to get.

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:35,074
Speaker 1: That's why I always play as justice a magical drop And other games are just as cheap the cheapest one.

39
00:02:35,436 --> 00:02:38,184
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway So you got any news.

40
00:02:38,264 --> 00:02:38,886
Speaker 0: gaming day?

41
00:02:38,906 --> 00:02:47,429
Speaker 1: I don't have any news necessarily, but I played this game that I saw Someone do a. I guess he does.

42
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:49,937
Speaker 1: It's total halibut this guy on YouTube.

43
00:02:49,978 --> 00:02:50,640
Speaker 1: He made a video.

44
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:53,108
Speaker 1: WTF is papers, please beta.

45
00:02:53,149 --> 00:02:53,951
Speaker 1: so papers, please.

46
00:02:54,012 --> 00:03:03,870
Speaker 1: beta is a game Made by Lucas Pope who's I guess an indie game dev guy who's made a bunch of really interesting games And this is the latest one that's in beta right now.

47
00:03:04,292 --> 00:03:05,800
Speaker 1: You can just download it and play it for free.

48
00:03:06,662 --> 00:03:12,071
Speaker 1: So I've downloaded and played it for free and it is Crazy awesome this game.

49
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:13,660
Speaker 0: So I haven't actually played it yet.

50
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,031
Speaker 0: So I have one question for you in terms of that kind of game.

51
00:03:17,332 --> 00:03:19,740
Speaker 0: Is it above or below old gravity bone?

52
00:03:20,781 --> 00:03:29,035
Speaker 1: It's not really anything like gravity bone at all in terms of quality, I guess of subjective experience I'd rather play this than gravity bone.

53
00:03:29,055 --> 00:03:29,679
Speaker 0: All right.

54
00:03:30,081 --> 00:03:36,565
Speaker 1: So the way it works is you live in some sort of police state in generic Europe The Stan I guess.

55
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:40,740
Speaker 1: the country you live in is I forget how to pronounce it Aristic or whatever?

56
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,121
Speaker 1: I don't know.

57
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:45,819
Speaker 1: All right, and it's a stand basically and it's bordering all these other stands.

58
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:51,079
Speaker 1: and What happens is you get conscripted to be the Border Patrol guy?

59
00:03:51,582 --> 00:03:53,980
Speaker 1: So your job is to sit there and approve passports.

60
00:03:54,641 --> 00:04:09,035
Speaker 1: so it looks and feels graphically a lot like a Carmen Sandiego 90s kind of PC game and Basically people walk into your little booth You push a button to to use the loudspeaker to say next someone comes in.

61
00:04:09,537 --> 00:04:10,319
Speaker 1: you see their face.

62
00:04:10,903 --> 00:04:12,819
Speaker 1: Right behind them is a height chart.

63
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:19,740
Speaker 1: Alright, they put a bunch of papers in the slot that you pick up You know with your mouse and move them over to your area so you can see them and flip through them.

64
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,005
Speaker 1: You see their picture on their passport.

65
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:26,740
Speaker 1: you see, you know all their information the passport numbers the official stamps.

66
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:32,360
Speaker 1: There's all these details and you've got to sort out whether to approve or to let them in or not.

67
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:35,053
Speaker 1: Let them in and there's all these tools at your disposal.

68
00:04:35,094 --> 00:04:43,928
Speaker 1: like you can look through the rule book You can look every day you get like a notice that says like, you know things that are happening today new rules things like that this news.

69
00:04:44,028 --> 00:04:48,606
Speaker 1: there's a newspaper and the newspaper is like so-and-so is Criminal whatever.

70
00:04:48,686 --> 00:04:51,380
Speaker 1: and then I see that guy come in and there's his name.

71
00:04:51,461 --> 00:04:53,920
Speaker 1: I remember him from the newspaper, but all his stuff checks out.

72
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,077
Speaker 1: so I call the guards over to arrest him even though his stuff checked out.

73
00:04:57,098 --> 00:05:05,640
Speaker 1: and The thing is the more people you let through the more money you get which helps feed your starving and dying family.

74
00:05:06,182 --> 00:05:12,826
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, but but if you let through say a terrorist Then the day ends immediately.

75
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:21,360
Speaker 1: or you know, there's plots like a girl comes in and gives like a card for like a strip club She's like, yeah, we're we are being you know, human trafficked.

76
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,306
Speaker 1: This is the name of our human trafficker.

77
00:05:23,367 --> 00:05:25,574
Speaker 1: if he comes in don't let him through.

78
00:05:25,594 --> 00:05:29,588
Speaker 1: but that guy came in and he had a valid Shit, so I let him through in the newspaper the next day.

79
00:05:29,629 --> 00:05:32,600
Speaker 1: It said, you know human trafficking girls killed.

80
00:05:33,622 --> 00:05:34,809
Speaker 0: Good job asshole.

81
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,560
Speaker 1: Hey, I will my family.

82
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:39,846
Speaker 0: I Thought you wanted justice.

83
00:05:40,328 --> 00:05:43,080
Speaker 1: and then they'll be like, you know a terrorist came from a particular country.

84
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,393
Speaker 1: So the next day anyone who comes from that particular country you have to use the you know X-ray scanner on them to see if they have you know goods.

85
00:05:49,855 --> 00:05:52,104
Speaker 1: so everyone who had goods I'm like up you're going.

86
00:05:52,124 --> 00:05:52,827
Speaker 1: you're going to jail.

87
00:05:52,927 --> 00:05:56,440
Speaker 1: good smuggler weapon bringer, but I got one guy came in.

88
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,512
Speaker 1: He's like it was just medicine.

89
00:05:57,532 --> 00:06:04,740
Speaker 1: you asshole You won't let me smuggle in medicine and I'm like, nope He's just trying to get medicine to his starving dying family.

90
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:05,402
Speaker 1: You know.

91
00:06:05,442 --> 00:06:09,314
Speaker 1: and the thing is the book the game really will catch you with.

92
00:06:09,334 --> 00:06:10,437
Speaker 1: like these details and like.

93
00:06:10,477 --> 00:06:12,037
Speaker 1: do you have time to check to see?

94
00:06:12,746 --> 00:06:14,079
Speaker 1: You know every passport.

95
00:06:14,099 --> 00:06:19,980
Speaker 1: well They can issuing city and if that's and there's a book of which cities are issuing cities for which countries?

96
00:06:20,401 --> 00:06:32,516
Speaker 1: so it's like you either memorize that shit, which is a pain in the ass because you're not gonna memorize that shit or You basically ignore it and I ignore it and once every day There's one person like a wrong issuing city and I'm just like fuck it.

97
00:06:32,656 --> 00:06:34,386
Speaker 1: I don't care Is it?

98
00:06:34,547 --> 00:06:35,532
Speaker 1: you got to play this game?

99
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:37,905
Speaker 1: I can't wait for the you know Final version to be out.

100
00:06:37,945 --> 00:06:39,673
Speaker 1: that if this is the beta holy shit.

101
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:41,060
Speaker 1: What's the final gonna be basically?

102
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:52,260
Speaker 0: I'm also on lately because I've had access to a lot of betas of games and if a game is good I almost don't want to play the beta and I'd rather play it once it's polished.

103
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:54,414
Speaker 0: I don't kind of reach red ground.

104
00:06:54,656 --> 00:06:58,750
Speaker 0: Sure, but that's More than a trivial amount of don't starve.

105
00:06:58,871 --> 00:07:00,497
Speaker 1: this beta ends really quickly.

106
00:07:00,537 --> 00:07:03,240
Speaker 1: It's really short So you're not retreading ground, right?

107
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,280
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like Monica where they add ground.

108
00:07:05,782 --> 00:07:21,307
Speaker 1: But the thing with this game is I really wish that would do a remix of it Where you would approve and disapprove people like in a modern setting and not in a fictional, you know Setting a police state setting and what you would it would do is at the end It would basically be like up.

109
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:25,628
Speaker 1: This is your racial bias your racial profile But no one's met.

110
00:07:25,668 --> 00:07:26,617
Speaker 1: He's not making that game.

111
00:07:26,637 --> 00:07:26,940
Speaker 1: You know what?

112
00:07:27,944 --> 00:07:32,200
Speaker 0: A similar game but instead it's TSA and it's do you let stuff slide or not?

113
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,926
Speaker 0: but the moral is there aren't any.

114
00:07:34,188 --> 00:07:39,413
Speaker 0: the only feel like one terrorist comes through out of a million people and The guys just got like a fucking bomb.

115
00:07:39,473 --> 00:07:40,380
Speaker 0: That's just obvious.

116
00:07:41,501 --> 00:07:41,963
Speaker 0: And that's it.

117
00:07:42,605 --> 00:07:44,773
Speaker 1: Anyway, you gotta check this thing out for free.

118
00:07:44,813 --> 00:07:45,495
Speaker 1: You got to check it out.

119
00:07:46,158 --> 00:07:46,780
Speaker 1: It's crazy good.

120
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:51,503
Speaker 0: The only reason I didn't play it actually today was that I was at work when I learned about it and I was kind of Busy at work.

121
00:07:51,724 --> 00:07:53,131
Speaker 0: Yeah, I couldn't just take a game break.

122
00:07:53,252 --> 00:07:54,860
Speaker 1: Well, you can do this as soon as I leave.

123
00:07:55,502 --> 00:08:00,900
Speaker 0: So as you guys know, I play a lot of counter-strike Scott's kind of falling off the counter-strike wagon.

124
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:04,480
Speaker 0: I worry you won't be able to click on my head as quickly as I can click on his head.

125
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:08,581
Speaker 1: If I I already have never been that fast at clicking on that I know.

126
00:08:08,641 --> 00:08:15,460
Speaker 1: but I uh, I'm even worse now clicking on that because I've actually played even less NS lately in favor of net run.

127
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:19,615
Speaker 0: So I was really good at counter-strike back in the day as in I don't know.

128
00:08:19,735 --> 00:08:27,730
Speaker 0: Yes one six Mm-hmm early 2000s is when I was kind of at my peak game and I was super fucking good at counter-strike.

129
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:33,313
Speaker 0: and You know, I've had my ups and downs and I've been playing pretty much continuously since then but not seriously.

130
00:08:34,056 --> 00:08:35,600
Speaker 0: and recently was counter-strike go.

131
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,474
Speaker 0: I kind of doubled down on replaying counter-strike.

132
00:08:38,695 --> 00:08:51,740
Speaker 0: being older and slower I am better than pretty much anyone on the pubs but at the same time I am easily in the bottom third or bottom fourth of players in the Competitive circuit which is what you would expect.

133
00:08:51,881 --> 00:08:53,409
Speaker 0: I only play a few hours a day.

134
00:08:53,429 --> 00:08:55,600
Speaker 1: anyone who can actually click on heads kills you instantly.

135
00:08:56,001 --> 00:09:01,740
Speaker 0: But I click on heads pretty well and counter-strike go hasn't been super popular.

136
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:04,798
Speaker 0: like it's still a very popular game, but it hasn't been stupidly popular.

137
00:09:04,818 --> 00:09:14,059
Speaker 0: and It's interesting that valve is really sort of pushing and adding updates to it and Really trying to make counter-strike come back in a big way.

138
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:16,245
Speaker 0: So they're supporting the competitive people and all that.

139
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:20,074
Speaker 0: but there was just a huge update to counter-strike.

140
00:09:20,395 --> 00:09:22,849
Speaker 0: good did a number of things all right.

141
00:09:23,155 --> 00:09:26,327
Speaker 0: one Hostage mode has received an update.

142
00:09:27,009 --> 00:09:28,593
Speaker 0: It's not the same as it used to be now.

143
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,760
Speaker 0: It is slightly less real.

144
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:32,454
Speaker 1: You still play the old hostage mode.

145
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,705
Speaker 0: Uh Maybe it depends on the map.

146
00:09:35,186 --> 00:09:35,467
Speaker 1: Hmm,

147
00:09:35,949 --> 00:09:51,079
Speaker 0: but basically on these new hostage maps and the way this mode works now instead of there being four kind of dopey hostages standing somewhere and You have to see T's have to get all of the ones who are still alive all the way back with their dope-ass getting stuck on crates mechanic.

148
00:09:52,761 --> 00:09:56,416
Speaker 0: Also the well, it's Italy just all sit in the house with sniper rifles.

149
00:09:56,617 --> 00:09:57,300
Speaker 0: Okay, let's go.

150
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:10,265
Speaker 0: So they've changed it and now there's two Maybe three in some cases individual hostages sitting down In different places.

151
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:16,905
Speaker 0: and what you do is you just guard him and if a counter terrorist finds one You can pick him up and carry.

152
00:10:16,966 --> 00:10:21,158
Speaker 0: him can still shoot but he's way slower carrying the hostage.

153
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,989
Speaker 1: in other words Everyone's gonna get a hedge.

154
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:24,300
Speaker 1: even I'm gonna get a headshot on the guy.

155
00:10:24,902 --> 00:10:29,155
Speaker 0: Pick up a hostage the terrorists get a ping that basically says oh shit guys.

156
00:10:29,456 --> 00:10:31,825
Speaker 0: Someone's gotta tell hostage They're walking out with.

157
00:10:31,886 --> 00:10:36,066
Speaker 1: so it's like catching the flag with a heavy fucking flag If you get and a bunch of flags.

158
00:10:36,146 --> 00:10:39,520
Speaker 0: if you get even one hostage out as CT's you immediately win.

159
00:10:39,961 --> 00:10:46,436
Speaker 0: Okay, it is made hostage maps way more fun and way less one-sided because.

160
00:10:46,656 --> 00:10:48,220
Speaker 1: but it really makes no sense.

161
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,557
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, you guys let two hostages die, but you rescued one.

162
00:10:51,597 --> 00:10:52,120
Speaker 1: Good job.

163
00:10:52,244 --> 00:10:56,790
Speaker 0: Well, no It does make sense in one sense that it has that immediate situation of.

164
00:10:56,851 --> 00:10:59,237
Speaker 0: we've stormed the compound had a victory.

165
00:10:59,758 --> 00:11:01,407
Speaker 0: of the two hostages We got one out.

166
00:11:01,468 --> 00:11:06,192
Speaker 0: So I think the way I look at it These are two dignitaries the president and the vice president.

167
00:11:06,633 --> 00:11:15,593
Speaker 1: if I save one of them, it's probably good enough But much more important sure the one who died feels great about it.

168
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:22,120
Speaker 0: the there there's a community Around making making maps that is very well supported for counter-strike go.

169
00:11:22,923 --> 00:11:26,760
Speaker 0: And what they've done is this all came out as part of operation payback.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:38,515
Speaker 0: Nobody seems to understand what operation payback is and everyone I saw in the internet was basically just complaining That they had to pay for some micro transaction.

171
00:11:38,595 --> 00:11:39,157
Speaker 0: bullshit.

172
00:11:39,358 --> 00:11:39,559
Speaker 1: Nope

173
00:11:41,564 --> 00:11:42,366
Speaker 0: If you pay

174
00:11:42,386 --> 00:11:42,446
Speaker 1: the

175
00:11:43,328 --> 00:12:03,760
Speaker 0: three dollars that it costs you get a little thing that says you paid next to your name anywhere you play and until July 31st, you get access to low-paying Officially sanctioned run by steam servers that run just all these new maps in a tight rotation.

176
00:12:04,021 --> 00:12:07,300
Speaker 1: Nice, I should pay because those are probably no shit cock servers.

177
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:18,055
Speaker 0: So basically you pay a tiny amount of money and as far as I can tell all or a significant portion of that money goes To the non employees who made these maps for the community.

178
00:12:18,095 --> 00:12:19,380
Speaker 1: That's something valve is doing a lot.

179
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:20,524
Speaker 1: That's their big thing.

180
00:12:20,584 --> 00:12:24,096
Speaker 1: now right is basically save on the money that you know.

181
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:33,440
Speaker 1: instead of hiring employees They set up the whole steam inventory system, which is like hey Regular old people out there make hats and you'll get money if people pay real money for those hats.

182
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,589
Speaker 1: And it's not game affecting items.

183
00:12:35,709 --> 00:12:38,099
Speaker 1: It's all just cosmetic stuff like maps.

184
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:42,354
Speaker 0: Yep It's not like pay three dollars to get the p92 twice as fast.

185
00:12:43,821 --> 00:12:46,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, no twice as many bullets don't have to reload right.

186
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:57,431
Speaker 1: it's just pay money for maps and all this game content stuff that doesn't imbalance any games and Most or all of that money ends up going to the community.

187
00:12:57,492 --> 00:12:58,555
Speaker 1: people making that.

188
00:12:58,696 --> 00:12:59,900
Speaker 0: so listen assholes.

189
00:13:00,121 --> 00:13:01,687
Speaker 0: You can play these maps anyway.

190
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:03,234
Speaker 0: many of them were already out.

191
00:13:03,294 --> 00:13:04,720
Speaker 0: They're just from the steam workshop.

192
00:13:05,022 --> 00:13:07,777
Speaker 0: You can just download them and run them on your goddamn workshop.

193
00:13:07,797 --> 00:13:08,280
Speaker 1: so good.

194
00:13:08,561 --> 00:13:19,870
Speaker 0: But if you pay the three dollars you get access to awesome servers That only people who paid three dollars and people they invite are allowed to play on For the entire for most of the summer.

195
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:26,707
Speaker 0: and let me tell you it's actually a really high quality community of people on those servers because of the Trivial barrier to entry.

196
00:13:27,028 --> 00:13:31,460
Speaker 1: if you want to make a game these days is you know and put it on steam Really?

197
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,767
Speaker 1: You should make your game moddable via the steam workshop because that is gonna carry your game For the longest time.

198
00:13:37,887 --> 00:13:41,200
Speaker 1: if a community builds now the community can basically maintain your game.

199
00:13:41,581 --> 00:13:49,960
Speaker 1: you can stop maintaining your game and go do something else and You can focus and your community will pay your community to keep updating your game forever.

200
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:57,435
Speaker 0: Or if you're one of those companies that really is focused on the game itself do this to offload The maps and kind of all that stuff to keep the community going.

201
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:58,260
Speaker 0: it'll maintain itself.

202
00:13:58,380 --> 00:14:04,702
Speaker 0: But you can then take the resources you do want to spend on the game on doing things like fixing bugs or adding new Hostage.

203
00:14:04,742 --> 00:14:06,691
Speaker 1: look at NS2 right.

204
00:14:06,932 --> 00:14:11,933
Speaker 1: all most of their shit is from the steam workshop And they keep incorporating the community stuff into the game.

205
00:14:11,973 --> 00:14:20,737
Speaker 1: a lot of the maps that they have our community Community maps right I mean in the NS2 though right a lot of the maps started out as community maps.

206
00:14:21,058 --> 00:14:24,832
Speaker 1: a lot of the you Game modes we call the spectator thing was community made.

207
00:14:24,933 --> 00:14:33,506
Speaker 1: almost all this stuff was was made You know by in with the community people and also the actual developers, so It's pretty awesome.

208
00:14:33,626 --> 00:14:36,220
Speaker 0: none of that is my news other than my news is one.

209
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:38,740
Speaker 0: I'm gonna double down as soon as I have time.

210
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:43,160
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get these maps running on the geek nights Counter-Strike server, and I'm gonna start still up.

211
00:14:43,401 --> 00:14:44,185
Speaker 1: yes, okay,

212
00:14:44,326 --> 00:15:00,979
Speaker 0: and I'm gonna start organizing play dates and Standing games so that we can start playing this shit together because as much as I like playing with the clan people I play with I kind of want to be neo and walk around a god Looking on to you peasants destroying them as I see fit.

213
00:15:01,241 --> 00:15:06,020
Speaker 0: Okay, - the only news that actually matters that the seven maps are downtown.

214
00:15:06,461 --> 00:15:06,722
Speaker 0: I never.

215
00:15:06,762 --> 00:15:09,930
Speaker 0: really a lot of these are new you know vertigo.

216
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:14,843
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure this is just the bottom floor vertigo oh Clever.

217
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:25,280
Speaker 0: and - I want to point out - all these maps are like militia and that they have crazy Details nice lots of weird little fucking room loading poops and toilets nothing like that.

218
00:15:25,962 --> 00:15:30,380
Speaker 0: Library which is this crazy maze of library with all kinds of awesome bookshelf.

219
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:31,604
Speaker 1: It's gonna be good.

220
00:15:31,684 --> 00:15:36,460
Speaker 0: Ella is this really sort of weird vertical favela with stuff all over the place, okay?

221
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:41,169
Speaker 0: Seaside has boats, okay Museum is just gorgeous to behold.

222
00:15:41,189 --> 00:15:41,992
Speaker 1: how about Vegas?

223
00:15:42,193 --> 00:15:42,675
Speaker 0: motel?

224
00:15:42,735 --> 00:15:43,819
Speaker 0: Vegas isn't there damn it?

225
00:15:44,202 --> 00:15:50,023
Speaker 0: Motel is pretty good, but uh CS Thunder CS Thunder.

226
00:15:50,304 --> 00:15:52,450
Speaker 0: this map was in Counter-Strike.

227
00:15:52,631 --> 00:15:53,413
Speaker 1: I think it was 1.1.

228
00:15:53,413 --> 00:15:55,680
Speaker 1: Yeah Counter-Strike something like that.

229
00:15:55,841 --> 00:15:56,404
Speaker 1: I think so.

230
00:15:56,464 --> 00:15:57,751
Speaker 0: I'm guess this is before that.

231
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:02,092
Speaker 0: This is the ancient days Counter-Strike you know.

232
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:12,420
Speaker 1: basically way back in the day There was one update to Counter-Strike that added a few maps one of those maps of CS Thunder Which was the best fucking map and then a later update?

233
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,108
Speaker 1: Removed the map and the map was forgotten by.

234
00:16:15,148 --> 00:16:17,034
Speaker 0: there was a story like the.

235
00:16:17,335 --> 00:16:20,359
Speaker 0: the source to the map was lost So no one could recreate it.

236
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:24,093
Speaker 0: I know is our favorite map ever and it was super popular at its time.

237
00:16:24,675 --> 00:16:29,211
Speaker 0: sadly nowadays I'm the majority people I played with have no idea.

238
00:16:29,251 --> 00:16:30,496
Speaker 0: They've never played Thunder before.

239
00:16:30,556 --> 00:16:31,560
Speaker 0: they're getting lost on it.

240
00:16:31,841 --> 00:16:33,069
Speaker 0: I had it memorized.

241
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:34,960
Speaker 0: it is pretty much identical to the You.

242
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:39,416
Speaker 1: just if you have a sniper rifle you go to the outside of the the hydroelectric dam.

243
00:16:39,476 --> 00:16:42,410
Speaker 1: if you don't you stay to the Inside and you go to the power control room.

244
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,140
Speaker 0: you stand in that top area looking down.

245
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,464
Speaker 1: You stay in the top area in the vent or in the catwalk And you hose everyone down.

246
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:58,357
Speaker 0: if you get enough players like 15 on 15 this map will recreate over and over again That scene in the rock where the Navy Seals come into that room and all the terrorists are up above them.

247
00:16:58,537 --> 00:17:01,789
Speaker 0: right that scene will Just play out every time meanwhile.

248
00:17:01,809 --> 00:17:03,315
Speaker 0: There's a sniper battle going on outside.

249
00:17:03,336 --> 00:17:04,380
Speaker 0: this map is so fun.

250
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,650
Speaker 1: This map is the best map.

251
00:17:05,731 --> 00:17:06,759
Speaker 0: so kids stay tuned.

252
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:11,540

00:17:21,484 --> 00:17:22,328
Speaker 0: that map was a.

258
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,933
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's a lost map.

259
00:17:24,194 --> 00:17:25,839
Speaker 0: I don't care about bad lost maps.

260
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:27,243

Speaker 1: I'm not saying it's a good map and just saying the lost maps good or bad.

Speaker 0: Boston, Connecticut packs, Australia.

270
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,789
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

271
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:00,260
Speaker 0: I tumbled this earlier.

272
00:18:00,401 --> 00:18:02,739
Speaker 0: I have a tumbler so you can follow me there.

273
00:18:03,342 --> 00:18:06,920
Speaker 0: But I promise the tumbler won't just be previews of things of the day going forward.

274
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:09,493
Speaker 0: But this is just too good to not be a thing of the day.

275
00:18:09,513 --> 00:18:10,840
Speaker 0: It is my thing of the day.

276
00:18:11,462 --> 00:18:18,848
Speaker 1: This is a collection of Soviet anti-drinking posters anti drinking So basically the most ineffective posters in the universe.

277
00:18:18,909 --> 00:18:21,516
Speaker 0: basically these posters are like stop drinking you assholes.

278
00:18:21,597 --> 00:18:22,640
Speaker 0: It's ruining everything.

279
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:33,974
Speaker 0: Here's a guy a plumbers like drinking with this bottle of Boca You know back And he's dancing with this broken ass pipe that I guess he was supposed to.

280
00:18:33,994 --> 00:18:35,260
Speaker 1: that means we want to drink.

281
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:39,380
Speaker 0: These all make me run a drink but there maybe that's the exact reason.

282
00:18:40,181 --> 00:18:43,460
Speaker 0: There's one where guys just drinking about to walk off a cliff and the government's like stop.

283
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,905
Speaker 1: I just imagined a bunch of guys.

284
00:18:44,945 --> 00:18:48,980
Speaker 1: they're sitting in the propaganda office and it's like alright guys you to make anti drinking posters.

285
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,685
Speaker 1: What drinking posters?

286
00:18:50,765 --> 00:18:52,369
Speaker 1: as in telling people do not drink?

287
00:18:52,389 --> 00:18:56,100
Speaker 1: They're sitting there drinking and he's like, why'd you say come rad?

288
00:18:56,523 --> 00:19:03,034
Speaker 0: I'll just say one thing The Soviet Union overall not the greatest thing to have happened in the history of humanity,

289
00:19:03,094 --> 00:19:03,796
Speaker 1: but

290
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:17,740
Speaker 0: the art especially the propaganda art that came out of the Soviet era is one of my favorite kinds of art and There are so many different styles Represented here, but they're so recognizably Soviet.

291
00:19:18,603 --> 00:19:19,166
Speaker 0: Enjoy these.

292
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:22,117

324
00:21:01,070 --> 00:21:03,640

Speaker 0: packs prime Well, then packs dev probably.

342
00:21:44,152 --> 00:21:49,999
Speaker 0: then packs prime all right, and then we had a little bit of a break because we're probably like hot Scott or anything.

343
00:21:50,019 --> 00:21:54,165
Speaker 0: and Then magfest Mark mag fast.

Speaker 1: That's right.

347
00:21:58,322 --> 00:22:03,126
Speaker 0: I haven't been looking forward to a concert as much as I'm looking only Seven months away.

348
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:05,899
Speaker 1: Ah, I guess we should get our panels in.

349
00:22:07,425 --> 00:22:08,860
Speaker 0: And yeah, we got shit on the internet.

350
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:20,745
Speaker 0: We just uploaded video of the second of our packs lectures from this most recent packs East our 23rd goddamn packs panel 23 in all those years.

351
00:22:20,785 --> 00:22:22,451
Speaker 0: We did 16 Otacon panels.

352
00:22:22,471 --> 00:22:23,475
Speaker 0: We have 23 packs.

353
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:24,820
Speaker 1: It's something just fly by the window.

354
00:22:25,201 --> 00:22:26,265
Speaker 1: I think it was a clock.

355
00:22:26,505 --> 00:22:27,308
Speaker 0: So Monaco.

356
00:22:28,011 --> 00:22:31,682
Speaker 0: I'll link to the other shows we've done on this but in a word Brilliant.

357
00:22:31,983 --> 00:22:36,598
Speaker 0: It's everything I expected it to be having watched it since 2010 right?

358
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:42,009
Speaker 1: so think about the early prototype of this game won mad awards at GDC or IGDA or whatever it is.

359
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:44,801
Speaker 1: It won a ton of fucking awards the earliest of prototypes Right.

360
00:22:45,242 --> 00:22:54,111
Speaker 1: and the guy basically takes this game and for years just keeps working on it and keeps working on it and keeps working on It and every time he brings it out of packs in its car.

361
00:22:54,131 --> 00:22:54,733
Speaker 0: I'll give you $100 right now.

362
00:22:56,540 --> 00:23:01,679
Speaker 1: don't die the game was already fucking incredible when it was brand new prototype.

363
00:23:01,699 --> 00:23:21,612
Speaker 1: and He brings out of packs like every packs with a slightly updated version and it keeps getting updated and updated and he just kept working On it and actually didn't stop working on it for many years just kept upgrading the game and improving on it and iterating and adding stuff to it and It would be just so much better every single time.

364
00:23:21,672 --> 00:23:23,820
Speaker 1: and it's like well, why even fucking release this game?

365
00:23:24,020 --> 00:23:29,980
Speaker 1: Just keep you know updating it or be like minecraft give it to us now and just keep giving us updates all the time.

366
00:23:30,562 --> 00:23:31,686
Speaker 1: But no, they didn't do that.

367
00:23:31,726 --> 00:23:34,576
Speaker 1: They just get working on it until like a week ago.

368
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:38,540
Speaker 0: Maybe a few days ago We got it a little earlier because we got a review copy.

369
00:23:38,841 --> 00:23:42,239
Speaker 1: They just friggin finally put it out saying here it is all these years of work.

370
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:44,952
Speaker 1: We weren't you know Duke Nukem forevering.

371
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:46,560
Speaker 1: We weren't half-life 3-ing.

372
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,590
Speaker 1: We really were just improving on it and not releasing it till it was done.

373
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:53,097
Speaker 1: Just like half-life 1. and here it is.

374
00:23:53,117 --> 00:23:57,034
Speaker 1: and Yeah, it's still terrific pocketwatch games.

375
00:23:57,135 --> 00:23:57,738
Speaker 0: I salute you.

376
00:23:59,024 --> 00:24:02,767
Speaker 0: The game is great But the thing is it's guy.

377
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:06,840
Speaker 0: there were things I expected to be great because I already played it in its early iterations.

378
00:24:07,041 --> 00:24:10,020
Speaker 0: Those things were still there and I was already excited about those.

379
00:24:10,803 --> 00:24:14,296
Speaker 0: But there were things that were great that I didn't anticipate.

380
00:24:14,356 --> 00:24:19,598
Speaker 0: I did not expect The characters and story to actually be what they were.

381
00:24:19,618 --> 00:24:29,240
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, I thought the game would just be sort of like, you know The characters are just sort of classes and they don't really matter But they put in like this whole story to this thing.

382
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:37,552
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good story and I think my favorite that the level of detail and we'll talk about what the game is in a. In case you've lived under a rock since 2009 ish.

383
00:24:39,180 --> 00:24:45,109
Speaker 0: But basically I noticed at one point when I just started playing I just got that review copy and I keep.

384
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,419
Speaker 0: I say we have a review copy because in full disclosure we do.

385
00:24:47,479 --> 00:24:48,584
Speaker 0: I hate it When people don't disclose.

386
00:24:48,604 --> 00:24:52,400
Speaker 0: they got something for free cuz you know by us or I paid for it actually bought a four-pack.

387
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:54,233
Speaker 1: I gave away two keys already.

388
00:24:54,254 --> 00:24:59,393
Speaker 1: I just gave one away I think in the newsletter and I gave one away on Google our Google Plus.

389
00:24:59,734 --> 00:25:09,658
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll give the other one away sometime But it was the fact that I was playing as Someone and I ran into a bathroom and I was like, oh I can pee cool.

390
00:25:09,738 --> 00:25:12,336
Speaker 0: That's funny Yeah, and I always kind of want to hide in the bathroom.

391
00:25:12,376 --> 00:25:12,819
Speaker 0: Just kind of pee.

392
00:25:13,043 --> 00:25:13,675
Speaker 0: This is what I do.

393
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:21,609
Speaker 0: And then one time I was playing as one of the characters trying to avoid spoilers there because you guys should just play this game And I couldn't pee and I was like what?

394
00:25:21,971 --> 00:25:23,640
Speaker 0: Oh, it's a girl duh, duh.

395
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:33,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the attention to detail in this game the time, you know Even though it's basically you look at it from far away and it's a bunch of pixelated mess just moving around.

396
00:25:33,902 --> 00:25:44,536
Speaker 0: It's like what the hell is going on but if you're focused on it like you're playing it it starts to become a sort of Blue like you start to just sort of jive and see through the matrix and see exactly what.

397
00:25:44,576 --> 00:25:48,856
Speaker 0: like you look at your little iconic Dude, your little red splotch, you know exactly what's up.

398
00:25:49,198 --> 00:25:51,840
Speaker 1: Yep Anyway, so what is this game Monaco?

399
00:25:52,101 --> 00:26:01,278
Speaker 1: It is a game about some thieves and these thieves bust out of jail And then they are trying to thieve their way to the riches and it's all oceans.

400
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:01,398
Speaker 1: 11 shit.

401
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:05,330
Speaker 1: You've got a person for every possible role that you would need.

402
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:11,870
Speaker 1: you've got a gentleman the recon the mole Yep, the lock-picking the cleaner the hack.

403
00:26:11,971 --> 00:26:13,396
Speaker 0: I like the cleaner a lot.

404
00:26:13,636 --> 00:26:14,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's your guy.

405
00:26:15,222 --> 00:26:16,928
Speaker 0: I pretty much play the cleaner or the mole.

406
00:26:16,948 --> 00:26:18,975
Speaker 1: I like to play the hacker.

407
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:21,526
Speaker 1: actually once I got the hacker I was like, oh shit.

408
00:26:21,687 --> 00:26:23,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can hit those power outlets exactly for it.

409
00:26:24,401 --> 00:26:35,660
Speaker 1: So here's the thing right, you know how in a lot of games you'll have a situation where we're like You know a class does something in particular, but maybe that class isn't really needed in a particular map or level.

410
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,011
Speaker 1: So it's like if you choose that class for that level, you're like, ah shit, right?

411
00:26:39,051 --> 00:26:46,135
Speaker 1: So for example, maybe you picked the Locksmith right, but this level doesn't really have that many locked doors.

412
00:26:46,336 --> 00:26:48,907
Speaker 1: It's like oh It's so disappointing right.

413
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:52,300
Speaker 1: or maybe you pick the hacker and this level doesn't have really any computers.

414
00:26:53,182 --> 00:26:54,347
Speaker 0: Every level has every.

415
00:26:54,427 --> 00:26:57,460
Speaker 1: every level has everything you can't pick wrong.

416
00:26:57,621 --> 00:27:00,012
Speaker 1: And this is why I like the hacker the most.

417
00:27:00,072 --> 00:27:07,720
Speaker 1: not because it's thematically You know hacker or because it's bright neon green like hacker, even though those actually are good reasons as green is the best.

418
00:27:09,422 --> 00:27:15,740
Speaker 1: The reason that I like to pick the hacker is because the security systems are the most annoying.

419
00:27:15,987 --> 00:27:25,454
Speaker 1: It's like yeah I could you know dodge one laser at a time and hack one laser at a time and one alarm Break the motherfucking wall down and walk around it.

420
00:27:25,474 --> 00:27:28,448
Speaker 1: sure you can do that too But it's tedious right either?

421
00:27:28,529 --> 00:27:30,700
Speaker 1: one of those things is tedious with the hacker.

422
00:27:31,062 --> 00:27:37,307
Speaker 1: All you have to do is get to the power outlet hit it for a few seconds and like Multiple rooms just open up to you.

423
00:27:37,388 --> 00:27:38,070
Speaker 1: No problem.

424
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:48,580
Speaker 1: You will just walk right through it's it's so You know of all the classes that one the most Reduces tedium and allows you to breeze through quickly.

425
00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:58,018
Speaker 1: I think if you're going for speed runs, which it seems some people are doing Guessing probably incorrectly that depending on the level hacker or mole are your guys.

426
00:27:58,218 --> 00:27:58,700
Speaker 0: I like mole.

427
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:01,269
Speaker 0: I don't use mole so much to get in is to get out.

428
00:28:01,329 --> 00:28:08,037
Speaker 0: I'll go around with the mole and basically make Escape routes for after shit gets fucked.

429
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,700
Speaker 0: Oh You're thinking hard because this game people have called it off and on a stealth game or an action game.

430
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:15,904
Speaker 1: There are stealth aspects.

431
00:28:15,964 --> 00:28:18,894
Speaker 0: there are but I think this is a genre.

432
00:28:18,934 --> 00:28:21,810
Speaker 0: We have rarely if ever seen I'm going to say right now.

433
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:22,979
Speaker 0: This is a heist game.

434
00:28:23,761 --> 00:28:26,472
Speaker 0: Heist is different from stealth in that in a stealth game.

435
00:28:26,512 --> 00:28:28,360
Speaker 0: Look at mark of the ninja, which I've been playing a lot of.

436
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,043
Speaker 0: I love that game.

437
00:28:29,083 --> 00:28:30,067
Speaker 1: That's a stealth game for sure.

438
00:28:30,107 --> 00:28:30,850
Speaker 0: That is a stealth game.

439
00:28:31,962 --> 00:28:33,399
Speaker 1: It's a stealth puzzle platformer.

440
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:41,872
Speaker 0: Yeah independent of Other aspects even if there is a way to fight or survive or get away if you fuck up The majority of people who are into games.

441
00:28:41,932 --> 00:28:43,460
Speaker 0: if you're playing a stealth game you get seen.

442
00:28:43,982 --> 00:28:47,113
Speaker 0: You just kill yourself and start over because you're going for that perfect run.

443
00:28:47,614 --> 00:28:53,173
Speaker 1: It's also in stealth games Fighting is usually super hard and dangerous like in Metal Gear Solid.

444
00:28:53,193 --> 00:28:55,020
Speaker 1: Basically, I would get seen and killed.

445
00:28:55,401 --> 00:28:56,968
Speaker 0: I could get away but fuck that I fucked up.

446
00:28:59,701 --> 00:29:02,071
Speaker 0: I'd being seen was tantamount to losing.

447
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:07,592
Speaker 0: as far as I was concerned in my own meta In Monaco, the game is not up.

448
00:29:07,612 --> 00:29:08,415
Speaker 0: you were seen now.

449
00:29:08,957 --> 00:29:09,600
Speaker 0: Everything sucks.

450
00:29:09,721 --> 00:29:13,960
Speaker 0: The game is sneak sneak sneak and then eventually you make a mistake.

451
00:29:14,321 --> 00:29:18,260
Speaker 0: Someone's seen the alarm blows and then shit goes crazy.

452
00:29:19,062 --> 00:29:19,644
Speaker 0: It's just now.

453
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:21,310
Speaker 0: it's everyone's like running around.

454
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:29,280
Speaker 0: the plan breaks down like every heist movie where you've got the perfect plan And then you know Scott Stepp breaks the you know breaks the laser beam and the alarm goes off.

455
00:29:29,561 --> 00:29:32,230
Speaker 0: And then it's every man for himself and it's just chaos.

456
00:29:32,310 --> 00:29:38,853
Speaker 0: Yep, and the fact that that chaos Is guaranteed to happen at least once every other mission.

457
00:29:39,114 --> 00:29:40,620
Speaker 0: It's guaranteed to happen constant.

458
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:42,520
Speaker 0: I've had a few missions that go off smoothly.

459
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:50,980
Speaker 0: You'll have the plan and the plan works But the plan not working is just as fun as the plan working and that is why I love Monaco.

460
00:29:51,181 --> 00:29:54,217
Speaker 1: It's also, you know, not that hard to escape right?

461
00:29:54,237 --> 00:29:55,646
Speaker 1: if you run No one sees.

462
00:29:55,666 --> 00:29:57,280
Speaker 1: you can like you hide in a bush or something.

463
00:29:57,681 --> 00:30:00,211
Speaker 1: You can wait a while and the chaos will calm down.

464
00:30:00,271 --> 00:30:02,780
Speaker 1: you can sort of try to pick up the piece exactly.

465
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:09,558
Speaker 0: But it's a situation of you've got one guy who's like off in the corner somewhere and there's guards everywhere over there And he can't get away.

466
00:30:10,469 --> 00:30:11,218
Speaker 1: He's the mole he can.

467
00:30:11,923 --> 00:30:15,400
Speaker 0: Sometimes the mole if he gets surrounded by a bunch of guards doesn't have a weapon.

468
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,028
Speaker 0: He can't break through walls fast enough.

469
00:30:17,450 --> 00:30:18,535
Speaker 1: No, not at all.

470
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,451
Speaker 0: Ah But I I love this game.

471
00:30:21,572 --> 00:30:27,880
Speaker 0: the online co-op works pretty well But it's really shines if you're playing together with people in the same room in my a lot of the levels, right?

472
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:32,699
Speaker 1: I guess it's theoretically possible to beat everything alone, but it's super hard.

473
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,767
Speaker 1: It's crazy hard to do it alone.

474
00:30:34,927 --> 00:30:42,115
Speaker 1: If you have friends it becomes way easier, but Because then you'll actually have a person who can actually do everything right?

475
00:30:42,135 --> 00:30:47,840
Speaker 1: It's like if I'm the hacker I'll go in and disable a bunch of computers, but then right after that it'll be like man.

476
00:30:47,941 --> 00:30:51,770
Speaker 1: I wish I had the mole right now to go through that wall But you don't you're the hacker.

477
00:30:51,972 --> 00:30:55,732
Speaker 1: if you had a hacker and a mole Well now you're talking business or maybe there'll be a guard.

478
00:30:55,752 --> 00:30:56,696
Speaker 1: You just can't get around.

479
00:30:56,716 --> 00:30:57,620
Speaker 1: It's like man.

480
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:02,300
Speaker 1: I wish we had fucking either the gentleman with his costume and a weapon or the cleaner.

481
00:31:02,662 --> 00:31:08,320
Speaker 1: So if you have a cleaner and a hacker and a mole now, you're really set Really most fun with three or four players.

482
00:31:08,481 --> 00:31:14,960
Speaker 0: I got a good chunk of the way through the game completely by myself But it's really tedious and not nearly as fun, right?

483
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:19,060
Speaker 1: If you have more people you can breeze through much faster much more efficiently.

484
00:31:19,201 --> 00:31:21,994
Speaker 1: But here are the problems with having more people.

485
00:31:22,155 --> 00:31:23,240
Speaker 1: you need to a coordinate.

486
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:24,244
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can do.

487
00:31:24,445 --> 00:31:28,240
Speaker 1: you can do that unless your rim - Scott is the worst cop.

488
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,947
Speaker 1: People means more people fucking up.

489
00:31:31,007 --> 00:31:35,820
Speaker 1: need I remind you of the level in four swords with the searchlights?

490
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,312
Speaker 0: That was one of my most memorable gaming moments.

491
00:31:40,473 --> 00:31:42,220
Speaker 1: with four people, right?

492
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:45,429
Speaker 1: You're gonna have four times as many fuck-ups, right?

493
00:31:45,449 --> 00:31:47,294
Speaker 1: Cuz everyone's gonna fuck up pretty much equally.

494
00:31:47,315 --> 00:31:57,000
Speaker 0: I Think I think it was the ninth or tenth time We've been hit by a searchlight and I don't remember who said it but someone said guys the fuck is wrong with you.

495
00:31:57,241 --> 00:31:58,445
Speaker 0: How hard is it to not get?

496
00:31:58,565 --> 00:32:02,317
Speaker 0: and it must have been karma, but that was when the searchlight got him.

497
00:32:02,498 --> 00:32:02,940
Speaker 1: That's right.

498
00:32:04,501 --> 00:32:05,906
Speaker 0: So, did you beat the game?

499
00:32:06,167 --> 00:32:06,929
Speaker 1: no, I'd be.

500
00:32:07,009 --> 00:32:08,855
Speaker 1: I didn't even beat all the blue love.

501
00:32:08,935 --> 00:32:10,400
Speaker 0: Oh, oh, okay.

502
00:32:11,064 --> 00:32:23,639
Speaker 0: So not gonna spoil stuff, but I'll say this some things happen in the game that are unexpected obviously and Game mode may change in a certain instance.

503
00:32:24,522 --> 00:32:30,140
Speaker 0: Trying to be really vague about this because it's the game is too good for me to waste my breath.

504
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,305
Speaker 0: Spoiling crap for you.

505
00:32:31,646 --> 00:32:35,220
Speaker 0: There is no reason anyone listening to geek night should not buy this game.

506
00:32:35,541 --> 00:32:40,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you have to buy a four-pack, it's cheap and give the rest of you don't even need xbla.

507
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:41,406
Speaker 0: I don't think even works on xbla.

508
00:32:41,446 --> 00:32:44,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the Xbox version they're having trouble releasing it.

509
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,752
Speaker 1: There's a statement on their site or something.

510
00:32:45,772 --> 00:32:46,700
Speaker 1: Just buy the steam one.

511
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,603
Speaker 1: What the hell is wrong with you.

512
00:32:47,743 --> 00:32:51,535
Speaker 0: and this game will run on pretty pathetic hardware and it works perfectly.

513
00:32:51,615 --> 00:32:57,472
Speaker 1: with steam big picture mode On your TV with Xbox wireless or wired controllers it works.

514
00:32:57,552 --> 00:32:58,875
Speaker 1: It's designed that way.

515
00:32:58,956 --> 00:33:00,219
Speaker 1: it's designed for that shit.

516
00:33:00,881 --> 00:33:04,734
Speaker 0: But yeah, seriously stuff happens at the end of the game.

517
00:33:04,754 --> 00:33:13,313
Speaker 1: That is crazy and unexpected I mean if they're working on for so many years, all right I would hope that you know, this would be the most polished and yeah, it is.

518
00:33:13,474 --> 00:33:15,000
Speaker 1: It is the most polished and amazing.

519
00:33:15,502 --> 00:33:18,673
Speaker 0: So the visual style, you know pixelation everything aside.

520
00:33:19,195 --> 00:33:28,187
Speaker 0: what I like about it is The Specifically the fact that it does that Ultima sort of style line of sight where if you can't see it You just can't see it

521
00:33:28,771 --> 00:33:29,758
Speaker 1: unless you're the lookout

522
00:33:29,879 --> 00:33:34,116
Speaker 0: true But even then the lookout just sees like the floating gun or the fist or the little doggy.

523
00:33:34,136 --> 00:33:35,300
Speaker 1: see that reminds me, right?

524
00:33:35,981 --> 00:33:38,920
Speaker 1: Another thing this game does, you know, I already mentioned four swords.

525
00:33:39,402 --> 00:33:41,991
Speaker 1: It gives you the Crystal Chronicles kind of action right where?

526
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:48,518
Speaker 1: remember in Crystal Chronicles on your GBA screen Everyone had something different one person at the map and one person had like the mission, right?

527
00:33:48,539 --> 00:33:53,220
Speaker 0: Whatever Sort of thing it forces you to share information among yourselves.

528
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:57,497
Speaker 1: It's not classes in the same way as Team Fortress 2, right?

529
00:33:57,597 --> 00:34:04,760
Speaker 1: It's Really strictly defined roles more than just classes, but everyone sort of has the same role, right?

530
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:10,636
Speaker 0: Recon fucking hide there and recon for me or a scout so I can see where I'm going.

531
00:34:10,656 --> 00:34:12,630
Speaker 0: don't get up to start running around For no reason.

532
00:34:12,873 --> 00:34:16,938
Speaker 0: Yep And I think what I hate the most is guard dogs though.

533
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:18,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, guard dogs are pretty rough.

534
00:34:20,804 --> 00:34:22,675
Speaker 1: A lot of the weapons are silenced like you can just get.

535
00:34:22,695 --> 00:34:26,172
Speaker 1: if you get a gun You can get away with shooting a lot of people.

536
00:34:26,233 --> 00:34:26,594
Speaker 1: Yeah.

537
00:34:26,716 --> 00:34:31,076
Speaker 0: Oh, you know many times I've cut the power just to murder the guard who comes to turn the power back on.

538
00:34:31,438 --> 00:34:33,868
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm That is like my go-to strategy.

539
00:34:33,888 --> 00:34:36,357
Speaker 1: And the thing is the items are really fucking useful.

540
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:36,980
Speaker 1: you get the EMP.

541
00:34:37,201 --> 00:34:38,668
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, it fucking cuts the power.

542
00:34:39,029 --> 00:34:42,612
Speaker 1: if you actually, you know use the computer virus thing It's like yeah It freaking.

543
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:47,820
Speaker 1: you know All the computer things in the sequence of where you walk so that you can get through very easily.

544
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,266
Speaker 1: It's like, you know when you.

545
00:34:49,388 --> 00:34:51,900
Speaker 1: these special abilities that you have are crazy powerful.

546
00:34:52,021 --> 00:34:55,940
Speaker 1: The mole can dig through any wall on any map anywhere ever.

547
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:57,569
Speaker 0: Well, there are a few things he can't dig through.

548
00:34:57,589 --> 00:34:59,560
Speaker 1: can't dig through to go jump out of a building.

549
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,303
Speaker 0: Yeah, he also there's.

550
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,508
Speaker 0: there's a courtyard.

551
00:35:01,548 --> 00:35:03,415
Speaker 0: There's one kind of like ultra security wall.

552
00:35:03,455 --> 00:35:04,600
Speaker 0: He can't seem to dig through either.

553
00:35:05,001 --> 00:35:05,623
Speaker 1: Oh, I have an encounter.

554
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:06,426
Speaker 0: It's not common.

555
00:35:06,446 --> 00:35:08,011
Speaker 0: Hmm, at least as far as I've seen.

556
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:10,600
Speaker 0: I've never not been able to dig somewhere.

557
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,643
Speaker 0: I really wanted to dig.

558
00:35:11,824 --> 00:35:17,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it but it's like yeah, right and everybody has a crazy powerful superpower like dune.

559
00:35:17,843 --> 00:35:18,749
Speaker 1: That is way off.

560
00:35:18,789 --> 00:35:20,380
Speaker 0: What I was getting at is that the visual style.

561
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:35,048
Speaker 0: There's the line-of-sight thing but augmenting that is that the places you can't see show either nothing or a blueprint of what should be there which is fantastic Immersion for a number of reasons.

562
00:35:35,289 --> 00:35:40,631
Speaker 0: one if you blow shit up and change stuff around The blueprint does not update to reflect that.

563
00:35:40,691 --> 00:35:42,016
Speaker 0: that's the plan from before.

564
00:35:42,056 --> 00:35:42,679
Speaker 0: you guys went

565
00:35:42,799 --> 00:35:43,239
Speaker 1: in Yep

566
00:35:43,722 --> 00:35:58,376
Speaker 0: Which is just really cool like you come around the corner because you forgot that you blew up a whole room and then you see Oh the room is still blown up and there's a bunch of cops here great And to some of the missions and sometimes you don't know what the place is like or the plan went wrong.

567
00:35:58,778 --> 00:35:59,480
Speaker 0: You don't see shit.

568
00:36:00,035 --> 00:36:09,060
Speaker 1: Yeah It's pretty much the information that you have on the screen is the information that your criminal guy would have in that high Situation and it's just communicated so elegantly.

569
00:36:09,582 --> 00:36:12,333
Speaker 1: Right, but at the same time you have to sort of see through the matrix.

570
00:36:12,394 --> 00:36:13,860
Speaker 1: if you're just watching some people play.

571
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,108
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like what but the people are playing.

572
00:36:16,128 --> 00:36:16,670
Speaker 1: you're like whoo.

573
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:20,201
Speaker 1: go like no, they know exactly what's going on Now.

574
00:36:20,402 --> 00:36:23,820
Speaker 1: and if you pick up the controller and move around a little bit, you'll know exactly what's going on.

575
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,164
Speaker 0: So let's talk about that game.

576
00:36:25,204 --> 00:36:30,700
Speaker 0: design wise the game is ridiculously intuitive and doesn't really need to rely at all on.

577
00:36:31,965 --> 00:36:38,220
Speaker 1: No, no, Mega Man Mega Man Like at one point a little bit where it says like yeah get ten coins to get more ammo for your item.

578
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, but notice how it only does that for things that are actually not directly intuitive.

579
00:36:42,779 --> 00:36:52,362
Speaker 0: Yep But as a result, there are so few core mechanics and they visualize so well that the game teaches you Automatically.

580
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:57,114
Speaker 1: the only buttons you have right and it Megaman's these at the beginning right is walk around.

581
00:36:57,134 --> 00:36:58,698
Speaker 1: Yep use an item.

582
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:04,869
Speaker 1: Yep sneak sneak and Look at your objectives and how much money you have.

583
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:05,271
Speaker 0: Yep.

584
00:37:06,114 --> 00:37:06,556
Speaker 1: That's it.

585
00:37:06,997 --> 00:37:07,519
Speaker 1: That's all you do.

586
00:37:07,821 --> 00:37:11,195
Speaker 1: It's most things in the game you interact with just by bumping into them.

587
00:37:11,416 --> 00:37:12,240
Speaker 1: It's like oh, there's a lock.

588
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,063
Speaker 1: How do I pick the lock?

589
00:37:13,184 --> 00:37:13,766
Speaker 1: walk into it?

590
00:37:13,987 --> 00:37:14,148
Speaker 1: Now?

591
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:15,393
Speaker 1: How do I hack that computer?

592
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:15,915
Speaker 1: walk in.

593
00:37:15,996 --> 00:37:17,060
Speaker 0: all these things are different.

594
00:37:17,381 --> 00:37:22,180
Speaker 0: I steal things walking stairs start the helicopter start the getaway car crack the safe.

595
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:27,220
Speaker 0: They all just show a little clock that ticks down at the time until you're gonna finish that task.

596
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,760
Speaker 1: So all you do is walk up to something keep walking into it until the clock finishes.

597
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,102
Speaker 0: Conundrums of.

598
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:35,291
Speaker 0: so there's a treasure that isn't what I'm after.

599
00:37:35,331 --> 00:37:38,440
Speaker 0: that's in that room surrounded by a bunch of guard dogs and shit.

600
00:37:39,083 --> 00:37:42,639
Speaker 0: I wonder if I can pick that lock in time before the guard dog comes back.

601
00:37:43,054 --> 00:37:44,645
Speaker 1: Yeah and the game will reward you.

602
00:37:44,685 --> 00:37:49,359
Speaker 1: basically every level you get sort of scored based on a. how much of the treasures did you get?

603
00:37:49,379 --> 00:37:50,684
Speaker 1: and Be?

604
00:37:50,987 --> 00:37:52,400
Speaker 1: how fast did you do it, right?

605
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:55,190
Speaker 1: So it's how fast did you complete the objective and how much treasure you got?

606
00:37:55,652 --> 00:37:56,174
Speaker 1: and it's you.

607
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,860
Speaker 1: basically you can go for complete treasure.

608
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,245
Speaker 1: you can go for fastest time.

609
00:37:59,286 --> 00:38:02,699
Speaker 1: you can go for both you, you know, it's sort of like portal does that?

610
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:04,865
Speaker 1: and What's a space cam?

611
00:38:04,885 --> 00:38:05,247
Speaker 1: does that?

612
00:38:05,327 --> 00:38:05,669
Speaker 1: Yes.

613
00:38:05,709 --> 00:38:12,176
Speaker 1: Cam is like less symbols or less, you know You know, whatever is faster finishing and whatever.

614
00:38:12,417 --> 00:38:12,940
Speaker 1: It's the same thing.

615
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,479
Speaker 1: We have multiple scoring metrics for challenging yourself.

616
00:38:17,902 --> 00:38:22,080
Speaker 0: So at one point you see an icon on a thing that looks like a dress like a tee a shirt like a work shirt.

617
00:38:22,602 --> 00:38:23,466
Speaker 0: Do you use that?

618
00:38:23,887 --> 00:38:26,820
Speaker 0: suddenly you're in a costume and guys just think you're a normal, dude.

619
00:38:27,445 --> 00:38:35,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, unless they get too close to you Then they sort of sniff away your costume or your disguise still gets you or in the hospital if you open those fucking boarded doors.

620
00:38:36,182 --> 00:38:40,065
Speaker 1: Yep, you know, but it's like yeah Disguises are fucking amazing.

621
00:38:40,085 --> 00:38:42,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why the gentleman is pretty cool.

622
00:38:42,333 --> 00:38:42,855
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like it.

623
00:38:42,875 --> 00:38:44,100
Speaker 1: when you get another character.

624
00:38:44,241 --> 00:38:47,280
Speaker 1: See the gentleman can get a costume disguise any time, which is great.

625
00:38:47,641 --> 00:38:54,060
Speaker 1: But like if another character gets a disguise super powerful hacker with a disguise you just fucking walk up and hack everything.

626
00:38:55,324 --> 00:39:12,800
Speaker 0: When you hack something a little green squirrel I guess yeah green square pops out of you And if it's some other someone else hacks a normal computer Then it's the color square of them just moves around the map along these wires Kind of disabling everything it bumps into until guards or time or whatever on hack it.

627
00:39:13,042 --> 00:39:14,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you can just hack a bunch of stuff.

628
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,580
Speaker 0: You kind of see your virus program going around cleaning stuff up for you, which is awesome.

629
00:39:18,942 --> 00:39:25,594
Speaker 1: The game's just intuitive means all because every most of the level designs, you know Every character is useful in every level no matter what level it is.

630
00:39:25,614 --> 00:39:34,460
Speaker 1: There's gonna be a thing to hack All right, there's gonna be a wall to break through When you get the hacking going on all the security systems just off and it's just like oh so relaxing.

631
00:39:34,460 --> 00:39:35,845
Speaker 1: I can't stress that enough.

632
00:39:36,367 --> 00:39:40,080
Speaker 0: The other thing I like is that if you kill a dude, there's a little Skellington laying there.

633
00:39:40,341 --> 00:39:43,433
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and if someone sees it they freak out and you can push it by.

634
00:39:43,453 --> 00:39:45,140
Speaker 1: you can push walking into it.

635
00:39:45,481 --> 00:39:46,165
Speaker 0: But yeah, I didn't.

636
00:39:46,225 --> 00:39:49,260
Speaker 0: I kind of didn't think about that because in mark of the ninja that's a big deal.

637
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:51,532
Speaker 0: Like when I kill someone I drag their body somewhere and hide it.

638
00:39:52,095 --> 00:40:01,619
Speaker 0: So I kill a dude I'm doing about my business and then suddenly I see this person come around the corner and bump into the Skeleton and then freak out And run and call someone on the phone and then guards are up my ass.

639
00:40:01,921 --> 00:40:04,273
Speaker 1: You can also hack the phones and then they can't call.

640
00:40:04,353 --> 00:40:05,800
Speaker 1: you can go and pick up the phone yourself.

641
00:40:06,142 --> 00:40:09,520
Speaker 1: You can go make a phone call to get someone to pick up at the other end.

642
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:19,419
Speaker 0: This game just does so much so elegantly with such economy That it is easily one of the best games to come out this year.

643
00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:23,852
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean we saw it coming and we saw correctly.

644
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,376
Speaker 0: It's everything I expected.

645
00:40:25,476 --> 00:40:28,308
Speaker 0: It's in many ways It's better than I expected in other ways.

646
00:40:28,649 --> 00:40:30,800
Speaker 0: I have almost nothing negative to say about it.

647
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,117
Speaker 0: You know what?

648
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:42,540
Speaker 1: This really replaces at least until everybody's beaten every level and gotten tired of it is the bomber man Does because it's like it's that kind of party game, you know, you know slot in your gaming library.

649
00:40:43,002 --> 00:40:47,580
Speaker 1: But it the thing it doesn't have that bomber man does is sort of an infinite replayability, right?

650
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:50,209
Speaker 0: It does have the ability does.

651
00:40:50,249 --> 00:40:50,992
Speaker 1: don't get me wrong though.

652
00:40:51,012 --> 00:40:53,000
Speaker 1: This game has a zillion fucking levels.

653
00:40:53,462 --> 00:40:54,064
Speaker 1: holy shit does.

654
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:55,148
Speaker 1: the game have a lot of levels.

655
00:40:55,550 --> 00:41:01,920
Speaker 1: you will not get old quickly, but Once you and all your friends have played all the levels eventually, it's like, okay.

656
00:41:01,980 --> 00:41:07,360
Speaker 0: But then what becomes fun is if you play like you've got two veterans and two people who have never played the game before.

657
00:41:08,141 --> 00:41:14,043
Speaker 0: It's just like in the heist movie with two veterans telling Robert Redford how to do it Like you.

658
00:41:14,064 --> 00:41:14,626
Speaker 0: listen kid.

659
00:41:15,028 --> 00:41:15,751
Speaker 0: Don't touch that.

660
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:16,454
Speaker 0: That's an alarm.

661
00:41:16,595 --> 00:41:17,659
Speaker 0: I want you to go over there.

662
00:41:17,821 --> 00:41:18,900
Speaker 0: I want you to hack that computer.

663
00:41:19,121 --> 00:41:22,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then when he doesn't hack the computer and dicks around on his own and shit goes down.

664
00:41:22,838 --> 00:41:25,479
Speaker 0: you can yell I told you as you run past his skeleton with the loot.

665
00:41:25,821 --> 00:41:32,499
Speaker 1: There's also a little bit super meat boy action where you sort of play the level and die and then play it again And now you know where shit is and you know where to go.

666
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:38,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there's also the thing is when you die Basically, you don't lose until all the characters are dead.

667
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:38,791
Speaker 1: Right?

668
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:40,476
Speaker 1: So and every time moles dead.

669
00:41:40,536 --> 00:41:46,011
Speaker 1: Well, yeah You can't use the mole again in this level and it's like shit.

670
00:41:46,272 --> 00:41:49,142
Speaker 1: cuz like you'll pick the character who's most useful for beating that Level.

671
00:41:49,504 --> 00:41:51,820
Speaker 1: they'll die and it's like well you have to beat the carrot.

672
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:55,297
Speaker 1: If you're playing one player now, you have to beat the level with a different character.

673
00:41:55,377 --> 00:41:55,920
Speaker 1: Not that one.

674
00:41:56,023 --> 00:42:05,080
Speaker 1: It's like well That's gonna be a huge pain in my ass To do it the other way and then you eventually just die all the way and then you start over with the same guy again.

675
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:12,875
Speaker 0: so This is one of the very rare Completely unqualified buys I can think of no one who hears these words right now.

676
00:42:12,916 --> 00:42:13,880
Speaker 0: who should not buy this game?

677
00:42:14,303 --> 00:42:19,648
Speaker 1: someone who does not have a PC or an Xbox cannot buy this game.

678
00:42:19,808 --> 00:42:22,676
Speaker 0: someone who actually does not have the $15 or whatever.

679
00:42:24,528 --> 00:42:25,178
Speaker 1: You're that poor.

680
00:42:26,021 --> 00:42:28,157
Speaker 1: Seriously, any computer can play this freaking game.

681
00:42:28,358 --> 00:42:34,512
Speaker 1: Yeah Any as long as you have a GPU Like an old-ass GPU like the oldest in dude.

682
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,822
Speaker 0: I'm playing it on a GTX 260.

683
00:42:37,822 --> 00:42:53,295
Speaker 1: it works beautifully on my HTPC which has like some AMD an ATI like hat low-profile piece of crap Radeon something old GTX 440 Something low-profile and with an i3 it runs flawlessly at 1080p.

684
00:42:53,315 --> 00:42:56,693
Speaker 1: So Yeah, get this game.

685
00:42:56,813 --> 00:43:03,997
Speaker 1: we told you a long time ago This game is good enough to do two full geek nights episode and an interview with Andy Schatz.

686
00:43:04,057 --> 00:43:07,170
Speaker 1: That was one of the episodes Like I think we did.

687
00:43:07,231 --> 00:43:08,340
Speaker 0: I did a preview I forget.

688
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:11,140
Speaker 1: I think I don't know how we can possibly recommend a thing more.

689
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:16,980
Speaker 1: We did more talk about this game on geek nights than about like prince of nothing or maybe not counter-strike.

690
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:18,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, counter-strike burning wheel.

691
00:43:18,330 --> 00:43:19,720
Speaker 0: We've talked about a lot too, right?

692
00:43:19,820 --> 00:43:28,576
Speaker 0: But I mean, come on seriously speaking of which we will soon as soon as we can arrange it We're gonna have tour on geek nights to talk about torch bear.

693
00:43:28,898 --> 00:43:31,814

695
00:43:35,791 --> 00:43:41,229
Speaker 0: I think he'll chuckle a little maybe like hey He's such a normal and nice person.

696
00:43:41,329 --> 00:43:44,320
Speaker 1: I know not a wacky or crazy or silly person at all.
