1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,567
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Tuesday, May 28th, 2013.

2
00:00:10,567 --> 00:00:12,412
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:13,915
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,076 --> 00:00:15,700
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights tonight.

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,144
Speaker 1: King of Tokyo.

6
00:00:19,266 --> 00:00:20,368
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,734 --> 00:00:24,976
Speaker 1: We're back from anime Boston.

8
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:25,818
Speaker 1: It was a good time.

9
00:00:25,838 --> 00:00:29,870
Speaker 1: It was cold as fuck and it rained the entire weekend.

10
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:30,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sucked.

11
00:00:30,693 --> 00:00:31,978
Speaker 1: That was the worst.

12
00:00:32,158 --> 00:00:34,168
Speaker 1: And I think the worst part of the worst was that.

13
00:00:34,188 --> 00:00:37,383
Speaker 0: We come home, we had one good sunny day and now up rain again.

14
00:00:37,564 --> 00:00:37,805
Speaker 1: Yep.

15
00:00:37,825 --> 00:00:43,124
Speaker 1: But as we left Boston, like literally we're sitting inside on Sunday, like, man, this sucks.

16
00:00:43,164 --> 00:00:44,169
Speaker 1: We can't go outside.

17
00:00:44,189 --> 00:00:45,938
Speaker 1: We finally are like, fuck it.

18
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:46,963
Speaker 1: Let's just get on our bus.

19
00:00:47,003 --> 00:00:50,238
Speaker 1: And as soon as we walk out with our luggage, it's like sunny again.

20
00:00:50,298 --> 00:00:51,041
Speaker 1: It's nice out.

21
00:00:51,443 --> 00:00:52,266
Speaker 1: Everything's cleaning up.

22
00:00:52,306 --> 00:00:53,069
Speaker 1: It's warm again.

23
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:55,478
Speaker 1: But yeah, anime Boston was great.

24
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:59,719
Speaker 1: If you're looking for coverage of that or anime kind of got to hold out to next Wednesday.

25
00:00:59,739 --> 00:01:05,304
Speaker 1: Cause we do four different geek night shows and this is the one we did after anime Boston and it's a Tuesday.

26
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:06,950
Speaker 1: So it's gaming.

27
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:07,672
Speaker 0: Okay.

28
00:01:07,733 --> 00:01:10,663
Speaker 1: Talking about games, but a game that we bought at anime Boston.

29
00:01:11,907 --> 00:01:20,743
Speaker 1: So I guess the news that we can talk about, that's probably the most interesting when everyone is waiting for us to say something dumb so they can yell at us because our listeners are weird.

30
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:25,596
Speaker 1: Sometimes is the Xbox Xbox one.

31
00:01:25,857 --> 00:01:28,626
Speaker 0: You know, I called the other Xbox, the Xbox one.

32
00:01:28,786 --> 00:01:30,693
Speaker 0: So now it's like this two Xbox ones.

33
00:01:31,154 --> 00:01:34,948
Speaker 1: I don't like the name one, but then again, I didn't like the name.

34
00:01:35,089 --> 00:01:39,024
Speaker 1: We see the thing that bothers me to play your Nintendo revolution.

35
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:43,563
Speaker 0: If I was a game company like Microsoft, it's like everyone just says Xbox, right?

36
00:01:43,864 --> 00:01:45,649
Speaker 0: Just call it Xbox.

37
00:01:46,091 --> 00:01:47,134
Speaker 0: Apple gets away with it.

38
00:01:47,154 --> 00:01:48,237
Speaker 0: Just call every iPad, iPad.

39
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,014
Speaker 0: And then on Wikipedia, people like third gen, fourth gen, whatever.

40
00:01:53,074 --> 00:01:54,399
Speaker 0: Just keep saying Xbox.

41
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:02,690
Speaker 1: The problem is if you say Xbox and it isn't backward compatible, some kids are going to buy an Xbox Xbox game and it won't work.

42
00:02:04,476 --> 00:02:06,984
Speaker 1: The reason they do that is because that way they brand in the store.

43
00:02:07,366 --> 00:02:09,493
Speaker 1: These are the Xbox 360 games.

44
00:02:09,734 --> 00:02:16,640
Speaker 1: So the kid with a regular old Xbox is like, oh man, dad, I need to know why Apple gets away with that on their iPads and iPhones.

45
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:21,584
Speaker 0: because it doesn't matter because the store just won't let you buy apps that won't work on that device.

46
00:02:22,007 --> 00:02:26,831
Speaker 0: If they just went, if they're going to go digital and they want this internet connected all the time, just go fucking all digital.

47
00:02:26,931 --> 00:02:29,021
Speaker 0: Throw the disk drive out, throw it out.

48
00:02:29,041 --> 00:02:34,803
Speaker 1: So the most exciting thing to me about the Xbox announcement was that the controller looks really good.

49
00:02:34,823 --> 00:02:35,807
Speaker 1: Yeah.

50
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:36,650
Speaker 0: I mean, sure.

51
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,713
Speaker 0: If I break one of my existing controllers, that one looks pretty much the same with a non shitty d-pad.

52
00:02:41,753 --> 00:02:46,514
Speaker 1: Well, I only own three, so I might buy one of the new one if it'll work with my HTPC.

53
00:02:46,535 --> 00:02:52,055
Speaker 0: I'm sure it'll work with your HTPC, but I, I read, I don't think it uses the receiver.

54
00:02:52,135 --> 00:02:57,656
Speaker 0: I didn't get a hundred percent details on this, but really downplayed that receiver in general.

55
00:02:57,696 --> 00:02:57,917
Speaker 0: Yeah.

56
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,471
Speaker 0: Someone said something about wifi, something like it goes, I don't know.

57
00:03:01,491 --> 00:03:10,509
Speaker 0: I don't know how this controller works if it uses the same wireless protocols, the old one or not, but it has pretty much the same buttons and it's mostly the same shape.

58
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:14,842
Speaker 0: and uh, yeah, d-pad that doesn't look like it sucks.

59
00:03:15,103 --> 00:03:22,728
Speaker 1: But it seems like they spent a lot of time when they were talking about it, focusing on all the sort of HTPC like things that it'll do.

60
00:03:22,748 --> 00:03:30,466
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean the Xbox in general, not Netflix all in one.

61
00:03:30,526 --> 00:03:33,096
Speaker 1: This is the thing that'll be connected to your TV.

62
00:03:33,156 --> 00:03:34,280
Speaker 1: that does everything.

63
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:48,340
Speaker 0: I mean, if you're a person who is somehow not listening to us and not building an HTPC like you should, and you have too many boxes under your TV, like a Roku and a console, you know, it's actually kind of good if you don't mind paying the fee for it, right?

64
00:03:48,360 --> 00:04:02,812
Speaker 1: You can throw your cable box out and just because one thing I noticed way back with my Xbox was that it did not, if you use like YouTube on that or on a Roku or anything, any device that isn't just an HTPC, you don't see all the videos.

65
00:04:02,852 --> 00:04:06,446
Speaker 0: If you do a search, you're done to make an HTPC.

66
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:07,450
Speaker 0: That's what you deal with.

67
00:04:08,112 --> 00:04:13,312
Speaker 1: Now, the thing is people were making a lot of fun about the like, Oh, eight gigs of Ram.

68
00:04:13,372 --> 00:04:13,653
Speaker 1: Huh?

69
00:04:13,693 --> 00:04:17,404
Speaker 1: That's like half of my laptop has, which is true, but it does.

70
00:04:17,886 --> 00:04:24,623
Speaker 1: People seem to forget that the Xbox one or the Xbox two even had 512 megabytes.

71
00:04:24,804 --> 00:04:25,064
Speaker 1: Yeah.

72
00:04:25,125 --> 00:04:31,746
Speaker 0: Game consoles always have less horsepower than PCs because they're not really multitasking.

73
00:04:31,787 --> 00:04:37,554
Speaker 0: And the software that is written for them is highly optimized because there's only one hardware thing to target, right?

74
00:04:37,594 --> 00:04:44,218
Speaker 0: Like if I read a video game for PC, I have to get that thing to work on any possible GPU that anyone has.

75
00:04:44,399 --> 00:04:46,827
Speaker 0: So I can't really highly optimize it for anyone.

76
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:51,164
Speaker 0: So I'm actually not really getting the most out of the hardware.

77
00:04:51,184 --> 00:04:53,294
Speaker 0: You know, that's what the demo scene is all about.

78
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,693
Speaker 0: The demo scene is like, Holy crap, look what that guy can make an Apple to GS do.

79
00:04:57,713 --> 00:05:03,880
Speaker 0: And it looks amazing because you're used to not used to seeing Apple to GS software doing that kind of awesome shit.

80
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:07,454
Speaker 0: And it's like, yeah, it's highly optimized for that specific hardware, you know?

81
00:05:07,594 --> 00:05:13,715
Speaker 0: So basically every console game there ever is, is demo scene, right?

82
00:05:13,795 --> 00:05:16,144
Speaker 0: It basically pushes that specific hardware to the limit.

83
00:05:16,164 --> 00:05:21,584
Speaker 1: because the PlayStation three where no one ever really pushed it because it was too hard to push.

84
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:22,066
Speaker 0: Yeah.

85
00:05:23,109 --> 00:05:25,114
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a Sisyphusian task.

86
00:05:25,255 --> 00:05:25,896
Speaker 0: Exactly.

87
00:05:26,598 --> 00:05:28,965
Speaker 0: But the Xbox, not really one thing.

88
00:05:29,186 --> 00:05:30,410
Speaker 0: someone did point it out, right?

89
00:05:30,471 --> 00:05:38,414
Speaker 0: Who won this console generation, the Wii U, the Xbox one and the PS four all have ATI cards.

90
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:39,136
Speaker 1: Yup.

91
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:49,616
Speaker 1: That was actually a good thing that I didn't notice at first, but is that I would pause it based on no other knowledge that that is AMD cutting some sort of sweet deal to steal that from.

92
00:05:49,636 --> 00:05:50,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, obviously right.

93
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,439
Speaker 0: It's not, that doesn't mean ATI is better that you should put it in your computer.

94
00:05:55,539 --> 00:06:02,465
Speaker 0: It's saying that ATI gave them a better deal because they're desperate and it's good enough for all those consoles.

95
00:06:02,526 --> 00:06:02,787
Speaker 0: Right.

96
00:06:02,967 --> 00:06:07,466
Speaker 0: And you know, for the console people, it doesn't really matter to them which one, right?

97
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:08,451
Speaker 0: It's, it's going to work.

98
00:06:08,773 --> 00:06:18,857
Speaker 1: The people who pay attention to the details of the specs by and large, I think are the PC gamers who are looking at them just to scoff at it and the actual demographic that's going to use the Xbox.

99
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:21,289
Speaker 1: We'll never know or care much about what's inside.

100
00:06:21,309 --> 00:06:30,754
Speaker 0: Also those really shallow people who still think there's a console war going on, like the, you know, the 16 bit era, they haven't gotten over it yet or their kids and they, you know, they're having their own.

101
00:06:30,795 --> 00:06:34,168
Speaker 0: So they need something to compare these consoles with no games.

102
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:36,597
Speaker 0: So really to me, compare the specs.

103
00:06:36,697 --> 00:06:41,071
Speaker 1: Super Nintendo Sega Genesis was actually the last console war, right?

104
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:45,446
Speaker 0: Because that was a time when you couldn't really buy both.

105
00:06:45,968 --> 00:06:49,742
Speaker 0: And both of them had drastically different game libraries, right?

106
00:06:49,762 --> 00:06:53,098
Speaker 0: There were very big, the number of games on both that were significant.

107
00:06:53,138 --> 00:06:54,082
Speaker 0: games were few.

108
00:06:54,102 --> 00:06:58,195
Speaker 0: nowadays, you know, it's like, yeah, okay.

109
00:06:58,195 --> 00:07:00,523
Speaker 0: 90% of the games on both these consoles are identical.

110
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:07,575
Speaker 0: The Xbox is going to have like a couple of games that aren't on the PS for the PC and the PS four is going to have a couple that aren't anything else.

111
00:07:08,038 --> 00:07:10,210
Speaker 0: And every other game is going to be in every single platform.

112
00:07:10,653 --> 00:07:12,703
Speaker 0: So what the fuck does it matter which one you have?

113
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,700
Speaker 1: There's no war unless you want Nintendo where it's all just on Nintendo.

114
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:17,322
Speaker 0: Yeah.

115
00:07:17,382 --> 00:07:18,567
Speaker 0: And there's two games also.

116
00:07:18,587 --> 00:07:21,558
Speaker 1: So Nintendo, I guess is at eternal war with no one.

117
00:07:21,578 --> 00:07:21,658
Speaker 1: Yeah.

118
00:07:23,221 --> 00:07:24,946
Speaker 1: Oh, Nintendo anyway.

119
00:07:25,066 --> 00:07:29,218
Speaker 1: But yeah, the Xbox I think is going to be the quote unquote.

120
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,047
Speaker 1: winner of this quote unquote.

121
00:07:32,247 --> 00:07:47,719
Speaker 1: console generation in the sense that a lot of people made this point that the Wii U does all the things that the nerds online are complaining about in terms of that it doesn't really have the kinds of DRM and always on lock-in stuff.

122
00:07:47,739 --> 00:07:48,744
Speaker 0: It has a region lock though.

123
00:07:48,925 --> 00:07:51,199
Speaker 1: It does have a region lock, but every console has a region lock.

124
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:55,592
Speaker 1: Except the DS, but even the 3DS has region lock now.

125
00:07:55,672 --> 00:07:56,615
Speaker 1: Seriously, Nintendo?

126
00:07:56,937 --> 00:07:57,258
Speaker 1: Really?

127
00:07:57,278 --> 00:07:58,762
Speaker 1: Who that fucks?

128
00:07:58,822 --> 00:08:06,285
Speaker 1: the one person who speaks Japanese and English and lives in America and wants to play games from both.

129
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:11,004
Speaker 0: And you still, why don't you know, share a region lock and translate your fucking games.

130
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:15,944
Speaker 0: You know how many amazing fricking games that are for Wii U and Nintendo systems in Japan.

131
00:08:15,964 --> 00:08:17,351
Speaker 0: They just don't bring here.

132
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:19,985
Speaker 0: Why do you even bother putting your console out in some other country?

133
00:08:20,005 --> 00:08:20,992
Speaker 0: We're not going to put any games out.

134
00:08:21,032 --> 00:08:23,485
Speaker 1: They did bring out that Nobunaga Pokemon.

135
00:08:23,525 --> 00:08:24,067
Speaker 1: And you know what?

136
00:08:24,288 --> 00:08:25,614
Speaker 1: It was pretty shit.

137
00:08:26,116 --> 00:08:26,357
Speaker 0: Yeah.

138
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,629
Speaker 0: But there are plenty of other games that are not shit.

139
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,594
Speaker 1: Are they not shit?

140
00:08:29,614 --> 00:08:30,640
Speaker 1: Or you just think they're not shakes?

141
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,324
Speaker 1: you haven't played them.

142
00:08:31,364 --> 00:08:32,953
Speaker 0: It's not even just Nintendo, right?

143
00:08:32,972 --> 00:08:36,529
Speaker 0: Look, the Phoenix Wright game comes out in like three days.

144
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:38,538
Speaker 0: Why is it not a simultaneous release?

145
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:41,171
Speaker 0: Those have been very successful in the U S and they're not shit.

146
00:08:41,393 --> 00:08:43,583
Speaker 1: Have the most recent ones made enough money to be worth it.

147
00:08:44,246 --> 00:08:44,548
Speaker 0: I'm sure.

148
00:08:44,629 --> 00:08:46,316
Speaker 0: if that's a Capcom game, first of all.

149
00:08:46,336 --> 00:08:46,537
Speaker 0: Right.

150
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:49,616
Speaker 0: And second of all, yeah, I'm pretty sure they made enough money to be worth it.

151
00:08:49,636 --> 00:08:51,263
Speaker 0: Cause why do they keep putting out more of them?

152
00:08:52,487 --> 00:08:58,627
Speaker 1: But the Xbox, I think just Microsoft still has the best online experience of all the consoles hands down.

153
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,400
Speaker 1: And it'll do a serviceable job as an HTPC.

154
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:04,227
Speaker 1: If you don't have an HTPC.

155
00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:04,649
Speaker 0: Yeah.

156
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:14,251
Speaker 0: I think what they've done, that's, you know, good is that, you know, Nintendo was like, all right, we're going to give up on your hardcore people and just target, you know, this new audience.

157
00:09:14,492 --> 00:09:14,834
Speaker 0: Right.

158
00:09:15,577 --> 00:09:28,558
Speaker 0: And they didn't realize, I guess that that new audience, you know, will love to buy your consoles like a Christmas present and have fun with it for awhile, but they're not going to be invested in it and continue to keep buying games and sit there and play it and play it and play it.

159
00:09:28,658 --> 00:09:32,250
Speaker 0: So it's really just sort of a one-time burst sort of sale.

160
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:32,932
Speaker 0: Right.

161
00:09:33,354 --> 00:09:39,377
Speaker 0: So what Xbox is doing is they're giving, they're also giving up on the hardcore audience, quote unquote, right.

162
00:09:39,658 --> 00:09:42,649
Speaker 0: Which I guess is people who really, really care about games.

163
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:46,624
Speaker 0: And they're just going for the regular core, which is huge.

164
00:09:46,644 --> 00:09:48,010
Speaker 0: It's just, that's all right, fine.

165
00:09:48,191 --> 00:09:51,583
Speaker 0: Call the call of duties and the halos and the maddens.

166
00:09:51,664 --> 00:09:55,539
Speaker 1: The regular core gamer probably outweighs all other gamers combined.

167
00:09:55,619 --> 00:09:59,053
Speaker 0: They just need to add in a console league of legends kind of game.

168
00:09:59,234 --> 00:09:59,816
Speaker 0: And that's it.

169
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:00,720
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

170
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:11,604
Speaker 0: Are they, if Microsoft doesn't make some sort of deal to just have, like, if I had the resources, I would be made, I, you know, I'm telling you a simplified game, MOBA, where you play with a game pad, right.

171
00:10:11,825 --> 00:10:19,312
Speaker 0: Will be a huge success, just like a simplified dumbed down FPS known as golden eye or, and, or halo was a huge success.

172
00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:24,729
Speaker 1: Now it is interesting that the connect is required included and a big part of this thing.

173
00:10:25,511 --> 00:10:33,839
Speaker 1: I'm curious if it, I still feel like the connect is just waggle in the way, like it's not adding anything to gaming.

174
00:10:33,939 --> 00:10:42,186
Speaker 1: Every connect game I've ever played has been pretty terrible and had pretty really, really bad actual controls with the connect.

175
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:44,452
Speaker 0: It adds a little bit to the was okay.

176
00:10:44,472 --> 00:10:53,223
Speaker 0: It adds a little bit to the HTPC aspect because you know, you're already not smart enough to build an HTPC.

177
00:10:53,263 --> 00:10:57,743
Speaker 0: You're probably not smart enough to handle like 10 remote controls with a million buttons on them.

178
00:10:57,763 --> 00:11:04,917
Speaker 1: You want to play some of these games and HTPC that'll play that level of game right now would be more expensive than the X-Box when it comes out.

179
00:11:05,178 --> 00:11:11,086
Speaker 0: Maybe, but the point is if you're not good at the kind of person who can figure out how to use three remote controls, right.

180
00:11:11,126 --> 00:11:15,903
Speaker 0: To handle your home theater, just saying X-Box play this show, right?

181
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:18,813
Speaker 0: Might work, especially if it works, which it seems to.

182
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:18,893
Speaker 0: Yep.

183
00:11:20,158 --> 00:11:22,771
Speaker 1: But a lot of people seem to be really afraid of the connect being online.

184
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:27,492
Speaker 1: Like suddenly I see all these blog posts of people who were comparing it to 1984.

185
00:11:27,492 --> 00:11:29,059
Speaker 0: Well, that was the penny arcade coming.

186
00:11:29,219 --> 00:11:29,360
Speaker 1: Yeah.

187
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:37,255
Speaker 1: But as everyone's talking about that and it seems like a lot of the people who are freaking out about it, I went back through their like Tumblr histories or blog histories.

188
00:11:37,778 --> 00:11:40,971
Speaker 1: They also were afraid of Google glass and other people wearing it.

189
00:11:41,272 --> 00:11:41,513
Speaker 0: Yeah.

190
00:11:41,955 --> 00:11:43,280
Speaker 1: I mean, yes, it's a connect.

191
00:11:43,521 --> 00:11:44,504
Speaker 1: It's a video camera.

192
00:11:44,946 --> 00:11:48,136
Speaker 1: I've got a webcam plugged into almost every computer I use.

193
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,164
Speaker 1: Use those webcams occasionally.

194
00:11:50,204 --> 00:11:53,016
Speaker 1: I can't imagine Microsoft doing anything is sinister.

195
00:11:53,257 --> 00:12:00,352
Speaker 0: No, but there were a lot of cases where people had webcams in their computers like, and then they would get hacks or something because they were stupid, right?

196
00:12:00,392 --> 00:12:05,833
Speaker 0: And installed some malware or they clicked on something or someone hacks the X-Box.

197
00:12:05,914 --> 00:12:06,716
Speaker 1: Exactly.

198
00:12:06,777 --> 00:12:07,499
Speaker 0: That's what's good.

199
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:07,740
Speaker 0: It's not.

200
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,669
Speaker 0: Microsoft isn't going to look at you, right?

201
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,956
Speaker 0: They don't give a shit, right?

202
00:12:11,438 --> 00:12:17,909
Speaker 0: It's going to be, someone's going to figure out an exploit where they can like type in your X-Box live username and then look at your living room.

203
00:12:17,930 --> 00:12:20,604
Speaker 0: And then Microsoft is going to be the one who gets in trouble.

204
00:12:20,645 --> 00:12:22,575
Speaker 0: Just like Sony got in trouble with their root kit.

205
00:12:22,917 --> 00:12:27,536
Speaker 1: To be honest, I think the likelihood of something like that actually happening is pretty low.

206
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:33,806
Speaker 0: It'll be a tough nut to crack, but if someone goes for it, I think they will succeed at least once and it'll get patched.

207
00:12:33,927 --> 00:12:37,264
Speaker 1: I feel like that's number one on Microsoft list of don't let that happen.

208
00:12:37,746 --> 00:12:40,240
Speaker 0: It could happen, but you know, it could happen with the current connect.

209
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:48,737
Speaker 1: A lot of people haven't plugged in, but I mean, I, it's funny cause it wasn't that long ago in gig knives, like 2006 we were talking about PC gaming was basically dead.

210
00:12:48,757 --> 00:12:50,665
Speaker 1: I mean, I was thinking about buying a Mac.

211
00:12:50,986 --> 00:12:54,821
Speaker 1: We were all console games and portable consoles and that was it.

212
00:12:55,443 --> 00:12:56,928
Speaker 1: And then PC gaming had a big resurgence.

213
00:12:57,008 --> 00:13:04,151
Speaker 1: and now the exclusives, PC wins in terms of exclusives was more exclusive.

214
00:13:04,312 --> 00:13:10,154
Speaker 0: All these like indie games and weird things you download and all that kind of stuff are the exclusives of the PC.

215
00:13:10,495 --> 00:13:13,930
Speaker 1: So I can't, for me as a gamer, there's almost no exclusive.

216
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:15,880
Speaker 1: that'll be on a console that isn't on my PC.

217
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:21,899
Speaker 0: Do you want to play some gods of war, meh, Forza, Gran Turismo and Halo?

218
00:13:21,979 --> 00:13:27,082
Speaker 1: You know, Forza, Gran Turismo, that kind of thing actually would be tempting if there was something else to go with it.

219
00:13:27,102 --> 00:13:31,660
Speaker 1: But if I buy just that, I basically bought a really expensive Gran Turismo machine.

220
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:32,362
Speaker 0: Exactly.

221
00:13:32,563 --> 00:13:43,072
Speaker 1: Kind of like how my previous X, my current Xbox 360 basically is a glorified street fighter and Pac-Man CEDX console.

222
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:44,857
Speaker 0: Pac-Man CEDX is on windows eight.

223
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:46,462
Speaker 0: It's not a windows seven though.

224
00:13:46,482 --> 00:13:48,329
Speaker 0: It's in the Microsoft store or whatever.

225
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:54,551
Speaker 0: And then, uh, street super, the most updated street fighter four is on steam.

226
00:13:55,073 --> 00:13:59,517
Speaker 0: However, I imagine if you're looking to play online against people, you're going to find a lot more people playing on X.

227
00:13:59,537 --> 00:14:01,588
Speaker 1: Well, luckily I'm not looking to play online with people.

228
00:14:01,628 --> 00:14:01,849
Speaker 1: Yeah.

229
00:14:01,909 --> 00:14:03,075
Speaker 0: So there you go.

230
00:14:03,597 --> 00:14:04,160
Speaker 1: So yeah, we'll see.

231
00:14:04,801 --> 00:14:11,423
Speaker 1: I don't think there's going to be much of interest in this so-called console generation console war.

232
00:14:11,725 --> 00:14:13,010
Speaker 1: There's three competing consoles.

233
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:17,973
Speaker 1: Two of them are going to be pretty much the same and it's going to come down to branding and exclusives.

234
00:14:18,535 --> 00:14:21,872
Speaker 1: and you know, kids who self identify as being with one console or with the other.

235
00:14:21,933 --> 00:14:27,021
Speaker 0: Call of Duty people, all millions of them are just going to buy Xboxes and play Madden and Call of Duty just like they have in.

236
00:14:27,081 --> 00:14:32,006
Speaker 0: Anyway, the one thing I think is going to be interesting, right, is the elimination of the used games, right?

237
00:14:32,026 --> 00:14:38,092
Speaker 0: And this is why, you know, regardless of writer first sale argument that we've made a hundred times, right?

238
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:40,442
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, everyone's like, Oh, steam.

239
00:14:40,503 --> 00:14:43,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no used games on steam, but they charge you a dollar.

240
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,142
Speaker 0: So you don't even care.

241
00:14:44,323 --> 00:14:44,563
Speaker 0: Right.

242
00:14:44,945 --> 00:14:45,868
Speaker 0: And this is the thing.

243
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,479
Speaker 0: Xbox games like Call of Duty, Madden, right?

244
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:56,164
Speaker 0: All the kids who don't have a lot of money, which is most of them, like all the ones that read anime Boston, right?

245
00:14:56,626 --> 00:15:04,293
Speaker 0: What they do is they buy $50 video games or get them as presents or something, especially single player ones that have endings.

246
00:15:04,554 --> 00:15:12,767
Speaker 0: They beat them, they sell them back to the store and then they buy a new one for like 10, 20 bucks, which is what they can afford, right?

247
00:15:12,787 --> 00:15:14,515
Speaker 0: Because it mean effectively 10, 20 bucks.

248
00:15:14,535 --> 00:15:15,660
Speaker 0: So they sold another one back.

249
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,001
Speaker 0: Yep.

250
00:15:16,242 --> 00:15:16,503
Speaker 0: Right.

251
00:15:16,985 --> 00:15:26,242
Speaker 0: And that's the only way these kids can afford to build a game library or to play a lot of games, you know, is doing this is selling games back and buying new ones.

252
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:34,070
Speaker 0: If you eliminate that ability, each one of those kids is basically going to sit there with his $50 game that he can't sell.

253
00:15:34,852 --> 00:15:35,173
Speaker 0: Right.

254
00:15:36,096 --> 00:15:45,934
Speaker 0: And he's only going to ever buy like four or five games, like maybe half as many games as they would have bought, which is really, really going to hurt, not the biggest, best games.

255
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:47,760
Speaker 0: Those will all still sell, right?

256
00:15:48,021 --> 00:15:57,600
Speaker 0: The same number of consoles will probably still sell, but the games that you buy with the 20 bucks you got for Mario, whatever those low, those less popular games, right?

257
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:04,346
Speaker 0: Are not going to see as many sales for 50, 60 bucks when the, you know, so it's only the top tier that will sell.

258
00:16:04,386 --> 00:16:09,146
Speaker 0: And these kids won't have enough money to buy, you know, two of the lower tier games.

259
00:16:09,166 --> 00:16:11,194
Speaker 0: They'll have to save up twice as long.

260
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:13,343
Speaker 0: So here's one of them.

261
00:16:13,584 --> 00:16:18,162
Speaker 0: So the long tail, when there's no used games, it's not going to go away in less.

262
00:16:18,705 --> 00:16:21,197
Speaker 0: They do steam pricing where shit is actually fucking cheap.

263
00:16:21,237 --> 00:16:22,081
Speaker 1: Here's what I would do.

264
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,166
Speaker 1: This is kind of out there.

265
00:16:23,246 --> 00:16:24,673
Speaker 1: If I were, if I had steam

266
00:16:24,713 --> 00:16:25,336
Speaker 0: pricing

267
00:16:25,778 --> 00:16:37,834
Speaker 1: now, I wouldn't do steam pricing because you can really milk the console, you know, that culture and those people in them, what they're expecting to pay for games, which is funny because you kids pay less for games than we paid in the NES era.

268
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:42,428
Speaker 0: Every single NES game I bought from the best one to the shittiest one was between 40 and 50 and $60.

269
00:16:42,428 --> 00:16:49,913
Speaker 1: I paid $75 and these are long time ago dollars for Zelda two on the NES.

270
00:16:49,953 --> 00:16:52,362
Speaker 0: My Zelda two was a gray cartridge only cost me 50.

271
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:53,025
Speaker 1: Mine was gold.

272
00:16:53,085 --> 00:16:59,394
Speaker 0: I bought it like way after it came out day one, but like I bought things like you would go to Toys R Us.

273
00:16:59,414 --> 00:17:00,118
Speaker 0: You'd look at the shelf.

274
00:17:00,138 --> 00:17:00,923
Speaker 0: You wouldn't know what to buy.

275
00:17:00,943 --> 00:17:05,223
Speaker 0: I bought like some golf game that wasn't a good one, but I didn't know that wasn't a good one.

276
00:17:05,243 --> 00:17:06,690
Speaker 0: And it was 50 bucks.

277
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:07,633
Speaker 1: Mario three was $65.

278
00:17:07,633 --> 00:17:13,252
Speaker 0: The Toys R Us dig dug to 50 bucks, you know, frigging everything 50 bucks.

279
00:17:13,313 --> 00:17:13,454
Speaker 0: But

280
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:33,581
Speaker 1: what I would do is set up some sort of system where if there's a game that's one of those second tier games, yeah, it's 50 bucks in the online store or whatever that your parents give you credits from their credit card because kids don't have credit cards and you have to get that sort of online sale from the kids who don't go to game stores anymore because they don't have anything to sell back.

281
00:17:33,962 --> 00:17:34,624
Speaker 1: Set it up to where.

282
00:17:34,644 --> 00:17:42,006
Speaker 1: if you already own Call of Duty, you get a $20 discount on this list of other games.

283
00:17:43,109 --> 00:17:46,881
Speaker 1: And that kicks in like six months after Call of Duty comes out.

284
00:17:46,981 --> 00:17:48,567
Speaker 0: Here's the problem with this strategy.

285
00:17:48,627 --> 00:17:48,868
Speaker 0: Right.

286
00:17:49,912 --> 00:17:53,204
Speaker 0: This strategy might get some sales on those other games.

287
00:17:53,726 --> 00:17:53,927
Speaker 0: Right.

288
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:56,859
Speaker 0: But it's only getting $30 sales on those other games.

289
00:17:56,919 --> 00:17:57,120
Speaker 0: Right.

290
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:00,046
Speaker 0: When kids resell their shit to GameStop.

291
00:18:00,507 --> 00:18:00,788
Speaker 0: Right.

292
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:06,160
Speaker 0: Basically, they're buying new copies of that.

293
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,549
Speaker 0: You know, they're buying fifty dollars for that of the game.

294
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:09,092
Speaker 0: Right.

295
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:13,832
Speaker 0: So even though some of the kids are like, sell a used one, buy a used one.

296
00:18:14,234 --> 00:18:14,535
Speaker 0: Right.

297
00:18:14,636 --> 00:18:16,102
Speaker 0: Someone had to sell that used one.

298
00:18:16,222 --> 00:18:21,881
Speaker 0: All those full price copies were sold at some point, you know, along the line there.

299
00:18:21,901 --> 00:18:22,303
Speaker 0: Yeah.

300
00:18:22,343 --> 00:18:27,000
Speaker 1: Well, you're really fundamentally changing that model of how you sell this.

301
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:28,666
Speaker 0: There's a lot of math there.

302
00:18:28,726 --> 00:18:28,927
Speaker 0: Right.

303
00:18:28,987 --> 00:18:37,081
Speaker 0: It's like, OK, if we were now taking the money from all the used copies, the GameStop sales and giving that to the developers, there's the there's the.

304
00:18:37,101 --> 00:18:40,734
Speaker 0: all of the original sales of the new copies are going down in price.

305
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,505
Speaker 0: So GameStop obviously is making any money here.

306
00:18:43,545 --> 00:18:49,072
Speaker 0: But how much will the original developer make if their first sales are down, but they get the money back from the use?

307
00:18:49,092 --> 00:19:00,817
Speaker 1: But at the same time, by cutting GameStop entirely out of the picture, you could probably come up with some way to capture a portion of that money that was previously in this sort of low run middleman.

308
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:04,841
Speaker 0: But here's the other problem with cutting GameStop out of the picture, which they're not actually doing.

309
00:19:05,042 --> 00:19:05,323
Speaker 0: Right.

310
00:19:06,527 --> 00:19:07,871
Speaker 1: Is well for used stuff.

311
00:19:07,911 --> 00:19:09,095
Speaker 1: They are a big game.

312
00:19:09,115 --> 00:19:10,298
Speaker 1: Stop is used stuff.

313
00:19:10,599 --> 00:19:10,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

314
00:19:11,481 --> 00:19:14,091
Speaker 0: Is that, you know, kids really only have cash.

315
00:19:14,251 --> 00:19:16,038
Speaker 0: They don't have credit cards.

316
00:19:16,098 --> 00:19:16,299
Speaker 0: Yeah.

317
00:19:16,339 --> 00:19:27,602
Speaker 1: You need to be really good about supporting a way for the parents or the kid to take money and put it into the Xbox account and then the kid can buy a lot of that game got sold to the store.

318
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:33,285
Speaker 0: New game got bought is just kids on their own with whatever money they can scrap together from who knows what.

319
00:19:33,366 --> 00:19:33,707
Speaker 0: Right.

320
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:49,925
Speaker 1: If, you know, parents are like approving every single game purchase is going to be a lot less fucking game purchases in total, unless they do the thing where you can buy the card with cash at like Wal-Mart and then use that to buy the game online.

321
00:19:49,965 --> 00:19:51,313
Speaker 0: Well, they'll do that all for sure.

322
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:53,083
Speaker 0: But actually, I think they're going to complete.

323
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:54,952
Speaker 0: they're getting rid of Xbox points.

324
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:59,476
Speaker 0: Now it's just going to show you dollars just like steam does, which is exactly what I thought they should have done all along.

325
00:19:59,496 --> 00:20:00,059
Speaker 1: I don't know.

326
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,565
Speaker 1: I understand why.

327
00:20:01,987 --> 00:20:05,422
Speaker 1: I understand why anyone ever does the points thing because it makes you money.

328
00:20:05,442 --> 00:20:07,231
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I just don't like it.

329
00:20:07,452 --> 00:20:09,582
Speaker 1: I don't agree with it, but I understand why.

330
00:20:09,602 --> 00:20:10,124
Speaker 1: Whatever.

331
00:20:10,626 --> 00:20:12,052
Speaker 1: But yeah, not super excited.

332
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:13,317
Speaker 1: Going to keep playing PC stuff.

333
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:13,719
Speaker 1: Yeah.

334
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:17,776
Speaker 0: Considering how my Xbox collects dust is pretty much a Pac-Man CEDX machine.

335
00:20:17,917 --> 00:20:18,720
Speaker 0: Not going to buy a new one.

336
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,030
Speaker 1: I haven't turned on my Xbox in six months.

337
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:27,701
Speaker 0: The thing is, if I sold my Xbox, I'd have to sell the other things that go with it, like that rock band guitar that would then become useless.

338
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:29,548
Speaker 1: I don't know any of that shit because I knew better.

339
00:20:30,452 --> 00:20:32,882
Speaker 0: My joystick is still good though.

340
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:34,067
Speaker 0: That works with PCs and stuff.

341
00:20:34,087 --> 00:20:34,749
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's just USB.

342
00:20:34,910 --> 00:20:35,131
Speaker 0: Yeah.

343
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:39,286
Speaker 0: I got a couple Xbox games to sell off, I guess.

344
00:20:40,169 --> 00:20:57,025
Speaker 1: So, speaking of doubling down on PC gaming, it's been a while since I've been in the market for a video card because I built my computer in 2009 and it can still play most of the games today because I built a fucking bad ass computer back in 2009.

345
00:20:57,025 --> 00:21:05,063
Speaker 1: So, a while ago, a long time ago, I upgraded to the GTX 260, which I'm still using.

346
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:07,891
Speaker 1: I finally hit a problem.

347
00:21:08,372 --> 00:21:12,226
Speaker 1: The draw distance and counter strike on some of these large new maps.

348
00:21:12,246 --> 00:21:13,111
Speaker 0: You mean counter strike go?

349
00:21:13,493 --> 00:21:14,056
Speaker 1: Counter strike go.

350
00:21:14,076 --> 00:21:17,231
Speaker 0: I imagine you can get full frames on hot max settings as counter strike stores.

351
00:21:17,272 --> 00:21:24,519
Speaker 1: I can't see in the windows of the lake house from the furthest edges of the map because of my draw distance.

352
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:26,971
Speaker 0: Even if you use the sniper rifle and zoom in double time?

353
00:21:26,991 --> 00:21:28,841
Speaker 1: Yeah, the draw distance is inside of that.

354
00:21:28,861 --> 00:21:30,007
Speaker 0: It just shows you a black square.

355
00:21:30,027 --> 00:21:32,822
Speaker 1: I see a gray square in the window and I can't see anything.

356
00:21:32,862 --> 00:21:33,565
Speaker 0: Even if someone's in there?

357
00:21:33,585 --> 00:21:33,685
Speaker 0: Yup.

358
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:34,569
Speaker 0: And you zoomed in?

359
00:21:34,710 --> 00:21:34,971
Speaker 0: Yup.

360
00:21:35,051 --> 00:21:35,654
Speaker 0: Whoa.

361
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:38,990
Speaker 1: So, I've been waiting for a while to upgrade my video card.

362
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:41,241
Speaker 0: What if you just turned the settings up?

363
00:21:41,261 --> 00:21:42,504
Speaker 0: Do you just lose too many frames?

364
00:21:42,524 --> 00:21:44,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's unplayable.

365
00:21:44,309 --> 00:21:58,297
Speaker 1: So, basically, I was needing a new video card anyway as well because I do a lot more video editing than I used to and my current video card cannot show me four rendered effects simultaneously.

366
00:21:58,758 --> 00:22:04,362
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I got the 680 and if I do premiere, pretty much everything is always rendered in the preview render.

367
00:22:04,382 --> 00:22:08,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, when I have like four scaled sets of hour long footage.

368
00:22:08,554 --> 00:22:12,365
Speaker 0: As long as the full way across the sequence.

369
00:22:12,987 --> 00:22:14,672
Speaker 1: So, the 780 came out.

370
00:22:14,712 --> 00:22:15,214
Speaker 1: The GTX 780.

371
00:22:15,214 --> 00:22:19,408
Speaker 0: Can you actually buy one now or is it just like announced announced?

372
00:22:19,468 --> 00:22:20,351
Speaker 1: It's on Newegg.

373
00:22:20,592 --> 00:22:20,953
Speaker 1: It's 650 bucks.

374
00:22:20,973 --> 00:22:25,289
Speaker 0: Whoa, I mean, I just looked up mine before the show.

375
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,001
Speaker 0: I bought a 680 like a year ago, maybe a little over a year ago.

376
00:22:28,021 --> 00:22:29,268
Speaker 1: So, yeah, my plan was to wait.

377
00:22:29,288 --> 00:22:30,757
Speaker 0: For 500 and it's still 500.

378
00:22:30,757 --> 00:22:36,077
Speaker 1: Was to wait for the 700 series to come out and then buy a 680 at a substantial discount.

379
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:38,707
Speaker 1: So, I gotta wait and see when that discount will come.

380
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:39,832
Speaker 1: I think it's not.

381
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:45,229
Speaker 1: I think the 680 is not actually going to drop in price until the 760 comes out.

382
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:49,822
Speaker 1: I might just buy the 780 because it's only 650 bucks.

383
00:22:49,923 --> 00:22:54,857
Speaker 0: It's only twice as much as Xbox one is probably going to be.

384
00:22:55,679 --> 00:23:02,991
Speaker 1: I think the Xbox one, if I had to guess, having not read a lot of news about it, like detailed news about pricing, I'm going to guess 500.

385
00:23:02,991 --> 00:23:03,874
Speaker 1: Really?

386
00:23:03,894 --> 00:23:07,953
Speaker 0: I think because of the connect and all that, I don't think you're going to see too many sales at 500.

387
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:12,759
Speaker 0: Remember, they got to have some sort of cheap version, like with the Xbox 360, the arcade edition.

388
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:13,261
Speaker 0: That was all.

389
00:23:13,422 --> 00:23:15,150
Speaker 1: I would expect there to be a more ghetto version.

390
00:23:15,250 --> 00:23:18,888
Speaker 1: But what's the deal with the connect and all that other stuff in there?

391
00:23:19,189 --> 00:23:21,904
Speaker 1: It seems like you can't sell it without the connect and stuff just won't work.

392
00:23:21,985 --> 00:23:25,603
Speaker 0: You sell consoles at a loss, man, especially, you know, the used game thing.

393
00:23:25,623 --> 00:23:27,090
Speaker 0: You got to sell the console loss.

394
00:23:27,612 --> 00:23:27,893
Speaker 0: Right.

395
00:23:27,933 --> 00:23:30,002
Speaker 0: So it's got to be three or four hundred.

396
00:23:30,404 --> 00:23:31,509
Speaker 0: three hundred for the cheap one.

397
00:23:31,529 --> 00:23:32,614
Speaker 0: Right.

398
00:23:32,694 --> 00:23:33,800
Speaker 0: Otherwise, how are you going to forget?

399
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,166
Speaker 0: No one's going to buy it at five hundred.

400
00:23:35,267 --> 00:23:36,151
Speaker 0: Only crazy people.

401
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:36,533
Speaker 1: Yes.

402
00:23:36,633 --> 00:23:37,437
Speaker 0: We'll see the PS3.

403
00:23:37,477 --> 00:23:41,839
Speaker 1: They sold it for like way too much money and still kind of worked out as a popular console.

404
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:43,951
Speaker 0: Kind of, you know, they would have done a lot.

405
00:23:44,012 --> 00:23:46,664
Speaker 0: You know, people went crazy, though, when they saw how expensive it was.

406
00:23:46,684 --> 00:23:46,924
Speaker 1: Wow.

407
00:23:47,245 --> 00:23:50,495
Speaker 1: So, yeah, people talking about the price.

408
00:23:51,798 --> 00:24:01,028
Speaker 1: The estimates are all over, but a lot of people are saying four hundred five hundred based on the last thirty five seconds of googling.

409
00:24:01,369 --> 00:24:02,936
Speaker 0: OK, we'll see what happens.

410
00:24:03,097 --> 00:24:03,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, we will see what happens.

411
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,957
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean, the seven eighty is useless unless you're a nerd.

412
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:10,004
Speaker 1: Use your computer for a ton of stuff and need video.

413
00:24:10,667 --> 00:24:12,834
Speaker 0: But it's basically even for gaming.

414
00:24:12,935 --> 00:24:15,484
Speaker 0: I have a six eighty every single game.

415
00:24:15,604 --> 00:24:18,716
Speaker 0: I can get full frames at full resolution with Mac settings.

416
00:24:18,756 --> 00:24:21,665
Speaker 0: So a seven eighty for gaming or like S.L.I.

417
00:24:21,686 --> 00:24:23,230
Speaker 0: for gaming is fucking stupid.

418
00:24:23,611 --> 00:24:29,089
Speaker 1: But I have alternative use cases of lots of video effects for gaming.

419
00:24:29,189 --> 00:24:29,792
Speaker 0: Exactly.

420
00:24:30,494 --> 00:24:32,160
Speaker 1: The thing is, I'm getting close to the point.

421
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:36,060
Speaker 1: I think another year is the longest I can hold out on this computer before I upgraded.

422
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,308
Speaker 0: I usually get new computers every five years.

423
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:39,693
Speaker 0: That's so you said 2009.

424
00:24:39,693 --> 00:24:41,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's twenty thirteen.

425
00:24:42,002 --> 00:24:43,085
Speaker 0: I know.

426
00:24:43,105 --> 00:24:43,847
Speaker 1: I know.

427
00:24:43,867 --> 00:24:46,997
Speaker 1: The thing is, my computer is still super powerful.

428
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:47,559
Speaker 0: Yeah.

429
00:24:47,779 --> 00:24:51,620
Speaker 0: I think the thing is, remember, I bought usually I buy a computer in eight hundred dollar range.

430
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:51,941
Speaker 0: Right.

431
00:24:52,343 --> 00:24:54,671
Speaker 0: This time I bought I seven six eighty.

432
00:24:54,992 --> 00:24:57,722
Speaker 0: I expect this to last six, seven years, not five years.

433
00:24:58,224 --> 00:24:59,929
Speaker 1: I've got the old nomenclature.

434
00:25:00,110 --> 00:25:01,534
Speaker 1: I seven nine twenty.

435
00:25:01,554 --> 00:25:02,196
Speaker 1: OK.

436
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:03,480
Speaker 1: From the old standard.

437
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:05,002
Speaker 0: I guess I have something.

438
00:25:05,143 --> 00:25:05,984
Speaker 0: I've something.

439
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:06,565
Speaker 0: I don't know.

440
00:25:06,826 --> 00:25:07,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

441
00:25:13,037 --> 00:25:15,582
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

442
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:23,040
Speaker 1: This is a collection of pictures of Klein bottles in all sorts of different.

443
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:25,208
Speaker 1: Here's a knitted Klein bottle.

444
00:25:25,489 --> 00:25:27,939
Speaker 1: Here's a toy that's set up like a Klein bottle.

445
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,324
Speaker 1: You can crawl inside of it.

446
00:25:29,344 --> 00:25:31,892
Speaker 1: I guess it doesn't turn you inside out like a proper one would.

447
00:25:31,912 --> 00:25:38,175
Speaker 1: Crazy glass work, triple, quadruple, quintuple Klein bottles.

448
00:25:38,576 --> 00:25:40,543
Speaker 1: If you don't know what a Klein bottle is, just go to the website.

449
00:25:40,563 --> 00:25:41,326
Speaker 1: You'll figure it all out.

450
00:25:41,948 --> 00:25:45,380
Speaker 0: OK, so OS game clones dot com.

451
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:49,898
Speaker 0: This site tries to gather open source re-implementations of great old games in one place.

452
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:53,192
Speaker 0: If you think that some information is GitHub something, something.

453
00:25:53,613 --> 00:26:04,291
Speaker 0: So, yeah, this site basically lists all the open source clones of games such as, you know, I guess they even, you know, Scum VMs on here, FreeSieve, Marathon.

454
00:26:04,371 --> 00:26:07,541
Speaker 0: There's an open RA, which is some sort of red alert clone.

455
00:26:07,561 --> 00:26:25,420
Speaker 0: There's something called DX and D2X or Descent clones is, I guess it lists things also like engines like ZDoom, his open Dune, like the, you know, the RTS keeper FX and it even tells you like sporadic development, active development, moderate active development.

456
00:26:25,761 --> 00:26:31,285
Speaker 1: Like even got inspirational games, like people are making these sort of spiritual successors to dead old franchise.

457
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:31,626
Speaker 1: Yeah.

458
00:26:31,666 --> 00:26:36,465
Speaker 0: For star control to, of course, it lists, these look like they're really low rent.

459
00:26:36,606 --> 00:26:39,659
Speaker 0: Well, yes, almost all of these that I've ever played in my life.

460
00:26:39,719 --> 00:26:42,028
Speaker 0: I've played a lot of open source.

461
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:52,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've played a lot of open source clones of games and they're all pretty much just like ghetto versions for, you know, they tend to have terrible UIs and bad graphics.

462
00:26:52,285 --> 00:26:57,460
Speaker 0: Yes, but they are mostly mechanically identical to the original games.

463
00:26:58,002 --> 00:27:01,378
Speaker 0: You know, I think someone actually got FreeSieve working in a browser.

464
00:27:01,418 --> 00:27:04,114
Speaker 0: So you can just like go to the website and play FreeSieve, which isn't too bad.

465
00:27:04,134 --> 00:27:04,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

466
00:27:04,677 --> 00:27:05,702
Speaker 1: Have you played FreeSieve?

467
00:27:05,742 --> 00:27:06,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's awful.

468
00:27:06,445 --> 00:27:06,706
Speaker 1: Yeah.

469
00:27:07,027 --> 00:27:11,222
Speaker 1: I mean, take the Sieve 2 experience, but make it more obtuse.

470
00:27:11,302 --> 00:27:12,285
Speaker 0: But in a browser.

471
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:17,562
Speaker 1: I could play it in a browser with some sort of browser DOS emulator.

472
00:27:18,986 --> 00:27:24,985
Speaker 0: Anyway, this is pretty interesting, you know, especially if you want to work on one of these games, right?

473
00:27:25,025 --> 00:27:32,994
Speaker 0: Maybe turn it into not a piece of shit or, you know, the ones that are just engines like ScumVM and such, right?

474
00:27:33,074 --> 00:27:36,166
Speaker 0: Oh, this is the X4, whatever it is that lets you play Ultima 4.

475
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:38,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think this is a treasure trove.

476
00:27:38,617 --> 00:27:40,828
Speaker 0: There's gonna be some on here you didn't know about.

477
00:27:40,869 --> 00:27:45,172
Speaker 1: This is mostly for aspiring developers because half these projects are dead and have the worst.

478
00:27:45,232 --> 00:27:48,773
Speaker 0: It's funny that most of them actually say active development on this site at least.

479
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:55,014
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then you go to them and it's like last push of code 2012.

480
00:27:55,014 --> 00:27:56,017
Speaker 1: I've been clicking through these.

481
00:27:56,037 --> 00:27:57,000
Speaker 1: They're not looking so good.

482
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,103
Speaker 0: Not to look so good.

483
00:27:58,504 --> 00:28:00,350
Speaker 1: Super Mario war.

484
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:03,280
Speaker 1: So Mario war is about super Mario multiplayer game.

485
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:06,370
Speaker 1: The goal is to stomp as many other Marios as possible.

486
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:08,698
Speaker 0: That's not really a clone.

487
00:28:08,739 --> 00:28:10,384
Speaker 1: That's just inspired by.

488
00:28:10,404 --> 00:28:11,187
Speaker 1: it's in that section.

489
00:28:11,689 --> 00:28:13,113
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

490
00:28:13,515 --> 00:28:14,578
Speaker 1: Oh, here's the source code.

491
00:28:14,699 --> 00:28:16,123
Speaker 1: Development is halted.

492
00:28:16,144 --> 00:28:17,307
Speaker 1: No updates since 2010.

493
00:28:17,307 --> 00:28:22,043
Speaker 0: Well, it's at least it says on OS game clones dot com development halted.

494
00:28:22,144 --> 00:28:24,191
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I went to the website.

495
00:28:24,251 --> 00:28:24,652
Speaker 1: It's halted.

496
00:28:24,933 --> 00:28:25,154
Speaker 1: Okay.

497
00:28:25,676 --> 00:28:29,409
Speaker 0: Xcom series, UFO, alien invasion, active development.

498
00:28:29,771 --> 00:28:31,377
Speaker 0: Let's see what this looks like.

499
00:28:31,437 --> 00:28:32,180
Speaker 0: Is there a screenshot?

500
00:28:32,922 --> 00:28:33,864
Speaker 0: There is a screenshot.

501
00:28:33,944 --> 00:28:34,605
Speaker 0: It was a look.

502
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:41,762
Speaker 0: It looks like system shock to level graphics on an X com.

503
00:28:42,465 --> 00:28:42,705
Speaker 1: Huh?

504
00:28:43,769 --> 00:28:44,009
Speaker 0: Huh?

505
00:28:44,411 --> 00:28:48,224
Speaker 0: You know, with the sort of really polygon ish three d where the sharp edges on everything.

506
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:48,646
Speaker 1: Yeah.

507
00:28:49,349 --> 00:28:50,333
Speaker 1: Oh, he's, he dooms on here.

508
00:28:50,856 --> 00:28:50,936
Speaker 1: Yeah.

509
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:51,700
Speaker 1: I don't want to play doom.

510
00:28:52,401 --> 00:28:53,383
Speaker 0: Who doesn't want to play doom?

511
00:28:53,423 --> 00:28:54,325
Speaker 0: I love doom.

512
00:28:54,405 --> 00:28:55,788
Speaker 1: I always forget how great doom is.

513
00:28:55,828 --> 00:29:02,831
Speaker 1: So in the banks we're going to, I'm going to start reading it soon.

514
00:29:02,852 --> 00:29:04,402
Speaker 1: It's got already finished it while ago.

515
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:08,643
Speaker 1: I've been busy, but there's a lot of rain coming up and I got a bunch of travel coming up and stuff.

516
00:29:08,663 --> 00:29:09,627
Speaker 1: So I'll probably reading a lot.

517
00:29:10,952 --> 00:29:12,880
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, we were at anime Boston.

518
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,412
Speaker 1: We did not one, not two, not three, not four, but five panels.

519
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:16,477
Speaker 1: Most of them were full.

520
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:18,589
Speaker 1: I'm sorry to any of you who couldn't get into them.

521
00:29:18,609 --> 00:29:26,230
Speaker 0: We will put video of some of them online maybe whenever I get around to it, except for that one where the cosplay guy was holding this cosplay sticks up in front of the camera.

522
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:26,873
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever.

523
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:31,912
Speaker 1: I think the only one I have really good video of is the last one we did, which is probably the best one.

524
00:29:33,297 --> 00:29:36,725
Speaker 1: And uh, yeah, next up Connecticut in July.

525
00:29:36,745 --> 00:29:38,249
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

526
00:29:38,750 --> 00:29:42,018
Speaker 1: And then packs Australia also in July.

527
00:29:42,038 --> 00:29:51,186
Speaker 1: And man, in fact, the week after me, we are literally running the panels and workshops department, all 14 panel rooms across three days.

528
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:52,810
Speaker 1: Jesus Christ, there's a lot of panels.

529
00:29:53,512 --> 00:30:00,971
Speaker 1: And then at packs Australia, I guess we're not omega knots.

530
00:30:02,816 --> 00:30:03,678
Speaker 0: I didn't buy a badge.

531
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:04,582
Speaker 0: I can't be an omega knot.

532
00:30:04,743 --> 00:30:04,944
Speaker 0: Yeah.

533
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:12,076
Speaker 1: I assume they only look at people who bought normal badges for the omega-thon and I assume they only look at people who buy a four day badge.

534
00:30:12,518 --> 00:30:12,799
Speaker 1: Yeah.

535
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,547
Speaker 1: If you buy just a Friday badge, that wouldn't make sense.

536
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:22,160
Speaker 1: So yeah, I guess with packs having mostly single day badges, I guess only the people who bought a four day badge are eligible.

537
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:22,963
Speaker 1: Hmm.

538
00:30:23,144 --> 00:30:23,545
Speaker 0: Interesting.

539
00:30:23,606 --> 00:30:24,469
Speaker 1: That's what I would assume.

540
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,557
Speaker 1: I will ask them cause I'm curious now.

541
00:30:26,577 --> 00:30:27,160
Speaker 1: Hmm.

542
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,589
Speaker 1: I'll bet it's that anyway.

543
00:30:29,629 --> 00:30:30,232
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.

544
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:35,975
Speaker 0: Are they going to have the omega-thon finale on Sunday and then Monday, no megathon, maybe daddy to omega-thon.

545
00:30:36,075 --> 00:30:37,320
Speaker 0: What's the closing ceremony?

546
00:30:37,621 --> 00:30:38,123
Speaker 1: I don't know.

547
00:30:38,706 --> 00:30:44,492
Speaker 0: I still think they should add, especially at packs prime where they have four days, they should have a pro megathon, right?

548
00:30:44,753 --> 00:30:46,320
Speaker 0: The omega-thon is keeping away.

549
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:47,083
Speaker 0: It is perfect.

550
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:53,951
Speaker 0: They have a pro megathon where it's like, you got to play the hardcore games, fighting game, RTS, FPS.

551
00:30:53,971 --> 00:30:55,798
Speaker 1: Well, if you're going to do that, do it like Tetris.

552
00:30:55,879 --> 00:30:59,570
Speaker 1: You have an online system with tryouts during the year.

553
00:30:59,590 --> 00:30:59,670
Speaker 1: Yeah.

554
00:31:00,834 --> 00:31:02,659
Speaker 0: It should be, you know, pros only, right?

555
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:07,482
Speaker 0: Let's see, you know, who the best omega knot is and then let's see who the best pro megaton right now.

556
00:31:07,502 --> 00:31:08,369
Speaker 1: You know what we're doing right now?

557
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:12,368
Speaker 1: The thing that Luke Crane hates that, you know, you should do, you know, you should do, you know, you should do anyway.

558
00:31:12,469 --> 00:31:25,338
Speaker 1: Anyway, so at anime Boston, of course, kinetic con the convention, we run the panels and workshops department for also is at other cons selling games and we were hanging out with them.

559
00:31:25,358 --> 00:31:27,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, they own, there's a game store.

560
00:31:27,306 --> 00:31:31,586
Speaker 0: The game store is actually called kinetic con like member and tournament center.

561
00:31:31,646 --> 00:31:32,430
Speaker 0: It's in Connecticut.

562
00:31:32,450 --> 00:31:37,996
Speaker 1: So I always forget that we get a big staff discount and king of Tokyo, that Richard Garfield game was just sitting there.

563
00:31:38,017 --> 00:31:38,378
Speaker 1: Yeah.

564
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:40,710
Speaker 0: So I was like talking about this game for a long time.

565
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:41,996
Speaker 0: I see it played everywhere.

566
00:31:42,016 --> 00:31:49,503
Speaker 0: It's got a good theme, like basically the theme of rampage, same theme and a shot up the board game geek rankings.

567
00:31:49,543 --> 00:31:50,648
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's way up there.

568
00:31:50,688 --> 00:31:51,994
Speaker 0: Let me see exactly where it is.

569
00:31:52,516 --> 00:31:52,717
Speaker 1: Yup.

570
00:31:52,858 --> 00:31:54,243
Speaker 1: It has average rating of 7.45.

571
00:31:54,243 --> 00:31:54,724
Speaker 1: It's ranked 108.

572
00:31:54,724 --> 00:32:01,064
Speaker 1: I think it, I think it's actually higher on the actual straight up list.

573
00:32:01,265 --> 00:32:02,208
Speaker 1: No, on the straight up list.

574
00:32:02,248 --> 00:32:05,217
Speaker 1: It's 108 on the family game list.

575
00:32:05,258 --> 00:32:06,320
Speaker 1: It's 16.

576
00:32:06,320 --> 00:32:07,163
Speaker 0: Whoa, that's pretty good.

577
00:32:07,344 --> 00:32:11,798
Speaker 0: Like that's every board game fucking ever 16 family games.

578
00:32:11,898 --> 00:32:13,845
Speaker 0: Like, wow, that's, that's a bit.

579
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:24,681
Speaker 1: I want to take it aside because this game king of Tokyo and several other games that are like it that have come out in recent history are all just Yahtzee with a twist.

580
00:32:25,563 --> 00:32:26,626
Speaker 1: Not saying that's bad.

581
00:32:26,967 --> 00:32:31,540
Speaker 1: I'm saying almost everyone we've talked to has never played Yahtzee.

582
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:32,660
Speaker 0: Right.

583
00:32:32,681 --> 00:32:34,427
Speaker 0: So let's list the games that are.

584
00:32:34,468 --> 00:32:37,178
Speaker 1: get through your life and not run into Yahtzee.

585
00:32:37,238 --> 00:32:43,779
Speaker 1: Yahtzee is like one under monopoly and one above candy land in terms of basic games.

586
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,162
Speaker 1: Everyone plays with here.

587
00:32:45,242 --> 00:32:50,963
Speaker 0: The games that are just like Yahtzee, uh, roll through the ages, not through the ages, but roll through the ages.

588
00:32:50,983 --> 00:32:52,769
Speaker 0: Uh, skyline.

589
00:32:53,171 --> 00:32:53,672
Speaker 0: Was that the one?

590
00:32:53,692 --> 00:32:53,833
Speaker 0: Yeah.

591
00:32:53,893 --> 00:32:54,375
Speaker 1: Skyline.

592
00:32:54,415 --> 00:32:54,756
Speaker 0: All right.

593
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:01,815
Speaker 1: Uh, what was the game I played at anime Boston where you colonize the planet?

594
00:33:02,617 --> 00:33:03,038
Speaker 0: I forget.

595
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:04,282
Speaker 0: You forget in frontier.

596
00:33:04,563 --> 00:33:04,804
Speaker 0: Yeah.

597
00:33:05,045 --> 00:33:05,647
Speaker 0: Is that Yahtzee?

598
00:33:05,848 --> 00:33:05,948
Speaker 1: Yeah.

599
00:33:05,968 --> 00:33:06,510
Speaker 1: That's Yahtzee.

600
00:33:06,851 --> 00:33:07,153
Speaker 0: Okay.

601
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:07,875
Speaker 0: Yeah.

602
00:33:08,116 --> 00:33:13,249
Speaker 0: Uh, there's just tons of games that are all actually just Yahtzee.

603
00:33:14,171 --> 00:33:17,820
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess, you know, zombie dice is sort of Yahtzee.

604
00:33:17,980 --> 00:33:18,221
Speaker 0: ish.

605
00:33:18,864 --> 00:33:20,028
Speaker 0: Not exactly, but sort of.

606
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:20,751
Speaker 1: Yeah.

607
00:33:20,771 --> 00:33:21,936
Speaker 1: Basically these are the games.

608
00:33:22,096 --> 00:33:30,910
Speaker 1: It is alien frontiers from before where you roll a bunch of dice, usually five, and then you pick which ones you want to keep and reroll the rest and do that twice.

609
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:33,599
Speaker 0: It's basically the same mechanic as draw poker.

610
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,943
Speaker 0: Only you get to draw twice.

611
00:33:36,327 --> 00:33:39,637
Speaker 1: And it's, I mean, Yahtzee has been around forever.

612
00:33:39,757 --> 00:33:47,822
Speaker 1: Yahtzee is one of those old as games that super studied ever, at least I assume until recently everyone I'd ever met had played it.

613
00:33:48,104 --> 00:33:54,835
Speaker 1: And suddenly, you know, I'm introducing these games to people and I'm like, oh yeah, it's basically Yahtzee, but with a, an attack component.

614
00:33:54,855 --> 00:33:56,442
Speaker 1: And they're like Yahtzee, what do you mean?

615
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:58,086
Speaker 1: The guy that talks about games online.

616
00:33:58,107 --> 00:33:58,909
Speaker 1: And I'm like, what the fuck?

617
00:33:58,949 --> 00:33:59,932
Speaker 0: What the fuck is wrong?

618
00:34:00,635 --> 00:34:05,230
Speaker 0: So basically what Yahtzee games come down to is, you know, is probability, right?

619
00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,679
Speaker 0: And there's different combinations of the die.

620
00:34:07,719 --> 00:34:11,132
Speaker 0: results will result in different scores or points or whatever.

621
00:34:11,212 --> 00:34:13,382
Speaker 0: So you need to know what you need, right?

622
00:34:13,563 --> 00:34:15,672
Speaker 0: In terms of score, you want more points generally.

623
00:34:16,514 --> 00:34:20,149
Speaker 0: And, you know, all of them have different odds, high scoring things.

624
00:34:20,228 --> 00:34:27,375
Speaker 0: And if the game is well designed, have low odds and things that score low are very easy to roll, relatively speaking in terms of percentages.

625
00:34:28,158 --> 00:34:31,991
Speaker 0: But you roll all the dice initially and you see what your results are.

626
00:34:32,292 --> 00:34:42,340
Speaker 0: And thus you need to calculate, aha, knowing that my first roll, now I can see certain scoring possibilities are more or less likely.

627
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:46,737
Speaker 0: Something that might be more points might actually be more likely than something that is less points.

628
00:34:47,138 --> 00:34:51,493
Speaker 0: Given the dice I have already rolled, like I've already got three sixes.

629
00:34:52,054 --> 00:34:55,023
Speaker 0: So rolling two sixes on two dice, right?

630
00:34:55,804 --> 00:35:04,836
Speaker 0: And with two chances to roll them, that's pretty likely right now, actually, you know, whereas it was incredibly unlikely when I rolled just all the dice to begin with.

631
00:35:04,956 --> 00:35:15,394
Speaker 1: So any game that has that mechanic of roll dice, pick some and do the poker thing until you have your set and then deploy the set in some fashion onto board or a score sheet.

632
00:35:16,196 --> 00:35:25,630
Speaker 1: If you play Yahtzee until you can play it basically perfectly where the winner is basically random based on the look of the dice, you'll be good at all of those games.

633
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:28,341
Speaker 1: Because once you master that, that's the core of the game.

634
00:35:28,382 --> 00:35:37,596
Speaker 1: And all the other stuff is just increasingly obtuse ways of actually maximizing the role after you roll it or understanding what is worth more points in the game.

635
00:35:37,617 --> 00:35:39,747
Speaker 1: Like Alien Frontier is worth noting.

636
00:35:39,788 --> 00:35:41,996
Speaker 1: I played Alien Frontiers for the first time at Anime Boston.

637
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:46,530
Speaker 1: And yeah, I just played Yahtzee and I won by so much.

638
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:47,675
Speaker 1: It was ridiculous, right?

639
00:35:47,715 --> 00:35:55,754
Speaker 0: Like if I play Yahtzee against some kid, like a middle school or high school kid, at least understand what's going on, unless they're the really smart kid, you know, I'm just going to win.

640
00:35:56,015 --> 00:35:58,446
Speaker 1: If Scott and I play, we might as well just flip a card.

641
00:35:58,506 --> 00:36:02,764
Speaker 0: Me and rim play, let's just post to keep taking the score sheets over and over again.

642
00:36:02,784 --> 00:36:11,990
Speaker 0: It's probably going to come out to 50% winning after a trivia in the standard standard officially published rules of Yahtzee.

643
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,835
Speaker 1: What is the maximum possible score?

644
00:36:14,638 --> 00:36:18,269
Speaker 0: I think you can only get a certain number of Yahtzees.

645
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:18,670
Speaker 0: Yes.

646
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:19,252
Speaker 0: Right.

647
00:36:19,332 --> 00:36:19,976
Speaker 1: Do you know how many?

648
00:36:20,036 --> 00:36:20,800
Speaker 1: Cause I had to look it up.

649
00:36:20,840 --> 00:36:21,604
Speaker 1: I did not remember.

650
00:36:21,624 --> 00:36:23,292
Speaker 0: I believe I'm trying to remember.

651
00:36:23,372 --> 00:36:31,136
Speaker 0: I think that my Yahtzee score sheets that I had when I was a kid official ones said, I got a triple Yahtzee.

652
00:36:31,558 --> 00:36:33,444
Speaker 0: You would get like 500 or something.

653
00:36:33,545 --> 00:36:34,428
Speaker 1: Triple Yahtzee.

654
00:36:34,448 --> 00:36:35,411
Speaker 1: That was a different game.

655
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:35,953
Speaker 0: Was it?

656
00:36:36,114 --> 00:36:36,455
Speaker 0: Yes.

657
00:36:36,957 --> 00:36:38,462
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess we had triple Yahtzee.

658
00:36:38,602 --> 00:36:44,422
Speaker 0: Cause if you had three Yahtzee's in one game, you would score a triple Yahtzee to get many hundreds.

659
00:36:44,944 --> 00:36:45,224
Speaker 0: Right.

660
00:36:45,325 --> 00:36:46,408
Speaker 0: And then, right.

661
00:36:46,428 --> 00:36:48,679
Speaker 0: So that you could act, you could keep filling those up.

662
00:36:48,719 --> 00:36:53,180
Speaker 0: And basically what would happen is if you manage to get enough Yahtzee's you wouldn't X out your Yahtzee hole.

663
00:36:53,581 --> 00:36:58,104
Speaker 0: So you would keep rolling even after everyone else had filled their score sheets and you could keep going and going.

664
00:36:58,144 --> 00:37:05,670
Speaker 1: So in the standard game, there are 13 chips and you can get on chip for every additional Yahtzee you get.

665
00:37:06,311 --> 00:37:14,710
Speaker 1: So if you get all 13 and you max out the rest of the game, your maximum total score is 1,575.

666
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:14,790
Speaker 0: Okay.

667
00:37:14,811 --> 00:37:15,494
Speaker 0: That sounds about right.

668
00:37:15,654 --> 00:37:16,438
Speaker 1: Unless Wikipedia.

669
00:37:16,458 --> 00:37:21,520
Speaker 0: I remember good Yahtzee scores would be in like the high 800, nine hundreds or low thousands.

670
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:21,862
Speaker 0: Yup.

671
00:37:22,043 --> 00:37:23,750
Speaker 0: You know, if you got a Yahtzee that's a hundred.

672
00:37:24,010 --> 00:37:30,338
Speaker 1: Seriously, in general, if you want to be good at games, and I feel I'm going to add this to our panels for the next time we talk about this stuff.

673
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:38,770
Speaker 1: Yahtzee itself is, while it's not a good game for people who know better, it is a great game to learn a lot of the basic skills of gaming.

674
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:39,130
Speaker 0: Yeah.

675
00:37:39,151 --> 00:37:48,454
Speaker 0: You're not going to be good at games unless you can master Yahtzee and Yahtzee is so transparent and easy to master just because it's not trying to hide or conceal anything with theme or anything like that.

676
00:37:48,957 --> 00:37:54,590
Speaker 0: So if you just play a lot of Yahtzee and so you've mastered it, then you're going to be really good at all these other games we're talking about.

677
00:37:54,911 --> 00:37:58,506
Speaker 1: It teaches you sort of opportunity costs about, it teaches you odds.

678
00:37:58,847 --> 00:38:04,229
Speaker 1: It teaches you when you're falling behind, you've got to go for things that are less and less likely to catch up.

679
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:09,389
Speaker 1: The hail Mary, the game, it also teaches you dice rolling and jigaboo jonesing.

680
00:38:10,451 --> 00:38:11,455
Speaker 1: Cause you roll in that cup.

681
00:38:11,977 --> 00:38:20,470
Speaker 1: I learned how to cheat as a kid by swirling the dice at the end or putting them in having two dice that I swirl while one's banging around in the middle.

682
00:38:20,851 --> 00:38:22,438
Speaker 1: And then immediately flipping the cup over.

683
00:38:22,459 --> 00:38:27,461
Speaker 1: I could consistently give myself three of a kind or really good odds and getting along straight.

684
00:38:27,803 --> 00:38:30,556
Speaker 0: We had, I had basically like, I didn't have the whole game.

685
00:38:30,596 --> 00:38:31,963
Speaker 0: I had like remnants of the game.

686
00:38:32,043 --> 00:38:37,889
Speaker 0: Cause I think it was my great uncles and it was mad old and decrepit, but it was basically from the pieces left over.

687
00:38:37,909 --> 00:38:43,450
Speaker 0: I could tell it was, had these orange dice and a cup and sort of a blue tray similar to Yahtzee tray.

688
00:38:44,553 --> 00:38:47,605
Speaker 0: But all the dice had letters on them for spelling.

689
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:47,826
Speaker 0: Yeah.

690
00:38:47,846 --> 00:38:49,792
Speaker 0: I don't remember what the name of the game was.

691
00:38:50,233 --> 00:38:50,454
Speaker 0: Yeah.

692
00:38:50,474 --> 00:38:53,320
Speaker 0: Let me see if I can find it on a board game geek.

693
00:38:54,062 --> 00:39:04,930
Speaker 1: King of Tokyo is at its core Yahtzee, but instead of deploying your dice to points, you deploy your dice to sort of one of three areas.

694
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:08,421
Speaker 1: You can either build up energy to buy super powers.

695
00:39:08,822 --> 00:39:15,862
Speaker 1: You can attack other players directly to kick them out of the game, or you can acquire victory points.

696
00:39:16,845 --> 00:39:22,722
Speaker 1: And the way the game ends is if you get 20 victory points, you win, everyone else loses game over.

697
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:29,422
Speaker 1: If you are the last man standing before anyone has gotten 20 victory points, you win game over.

698
00:39:30,384 --> 00:39:31,849
Speaker 1: So it adds that element.

699
00:39:32,009 --> 00:39:33,314
Speaker 1: It's not a great game.

700
00:39:33,454 --> 00:39:34,919
Speaker 1: It's eminently solvable.

701
00:39:35,221 --> 00:39:40,059
Speaker 1: The odds, once you figure them out and once you know the strategy, there's not a lot going on there.

702
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:46,446
Speaker 1: It ends up having chip taking game elements with the attacking, but the way it gets around that is very elegant.

703
00:39:46,506 --> 00:39:50,680
Speaker 1: It's a very sort of, I can see why this is a Richard Garfield game.

704
00:39:51,383 --> 00:40:00,334
Speaker 1: So the way it works is you roll your dice, and if you get the claws, which lets you attack, if you're in Tokyo, you do damage to everyone who's not in Tokyo.

705
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:05,270
Speaker 1: If you're not in Tokyo, you only do damage to the person who's in Tokyo.

706
00:40:06,791 --> 00:40:14,538
Speaker 1: When you take damage and you're in Tokyo, you have the option to stay the fuck there anyway, or to concede Tokyo to whoever hits you.

707
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:21,438
Speaker 1: If you stay in Tokyo all the way until your next turn, you get two victory points for remaining in Tokyo.

708
00:40:21,960 --> 00:40:26,513
Speaker 1: So the game has this sort of sunk cost fallacy, "Do I hold

709
00:40:26,754 --> 00:40:26,895
Speaker 1: out?"

710
00:40:27,497 --> 00:40:29,182
Speaker 1: or "Oh, I've taken too much damage.

711
00:40:29,323 --> 00:40:30,126
Speaker 1: I've got a bail.

712
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:33,317
Speaker 1: How much am I willing to risk on the next person's roll?

713
00:40:33,718 --> 00:40:36,788
Speaker 1: Do I go for fucking other people or victory points on my

714
00:40:36,989 --> 00:40:37,090
Speaker 1: own?".

715
00:40:37,832 --> 00:40:48,658
Speaker 1: It adds just enough to where it's a good game to play as the light warm-up game before your real game, because it takes 20 minutes to play this game, and it takes five minutes to teach this game.

716
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,686
Speaker 0: I found the word Yahtzee.

717
00:40:50,786 --> 00:40:55,687
Speaker 0: It's Spill and Spell, also known as Scribbage, which is now I guess known as Word Yahtzee.

718
00:40:56,009 --> 00:40:57,939
Speaker 0: But yeah, this is the exact one that I had.

719
00:40:57,979 --> 00:40:59,910
Speaker 0: See it here with these orange dice and the cup?

720
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,038
Speaker 1: I've never seen that in my life.

721
00:41:02,178 --> 00:41:07,325
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's apparently fuck tons of versions of it called Spill and Spell, Scribbage, and Word Yahtzee.

722
00:41:07,647 --> 00:41:08,089
Speaker 0: So there you go.

723
00:41:09,270 --> 00:41:11,323
Speaker 1: So I don't know, what do you think of King of Tokyo?

724
00:41:11,344 --> 00:41:12,229
Speaker 1: Because you played it with me.

725
00:41:12,610 --> 00:41:17,350
Speaker 0: Well, King of Tokyo I think has some really elegant elements to it, right?

726
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:22,610
Speaker 1: The fact that the chip taking is based on are you in or out as opposed to I'm attacking this player.

727
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:26,169
Speaker 0: Right, it's basically you're forced into Tokyo, right, if you don't want to be.

728
00:41:26,850 --> 00:41:34,081
Speaker 0: And then it's like, you know, you basically either leave as soon as someone rolls a claw on purpose because you're going to die.

729
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:35,850
Speaker 1: Or you hold out to the bitter fucking end.

730
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:40,608
Speaker 0: If you're going to stay in there, you got to stay in there until it's your turn.

731
00:41:40,729 --> 00:41:42,495
Speaker 0: Unless something freakish happens, right?

732
00:41:42,515 --> 00:41:49,345
Speaker 0: Like maybe, you know, somebody rolls like four claws and it's like, okay, I didn't think it would roll four claws, right?

733
00:41:49,365 --> 00:41:51,976
Speaker 0: I thought I could make it around with my 10 health, but I guess not.

734
00:41:52,037 --> 00:41:54,646
Speaker 0: So I'm going to pull out now, right?

735
00:41:55,388 --> 00:42:10,447
Speaker 0: But even then, if you get down in your health from like a four claw roll when you're in Tokyo and you're out of Tokyo, the person who just went in, you know, uh, if they gave it becomes to, you know, whoever's in Tokyo, if they roll and do some damage, that might kill you off.

736
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:13,480
Speaker 0: So think of this, they're not safe, but you need to roll hard.

737
00:42:13,882 --> 00:42:15,510
Speaker 1: If you're in Tokyo, it's like King of the Hill.

738
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:18,139
Speaker 1: You're getting points for being in the King of the Hill place.

739
00:42:18,802 --> 00:42:24,362
Speaker 1: But instead of basically now, every other player is doing damage only to you.

740
00:42:24,382 --> 00:42:27,132
Speaker 1: Well, if you're in Tokyo, you're doing damage to everyone else.

741
00:42:27,373 --> 00:42:34,340
Speaker 1: So when you're in Tokyo, you're effectively getting an analog to victory points by doing damage because you're taking everyone else down equally.

742
00:42:35,425 --> 00:42:40,702
Speaker 1: But if anyone attacks you, they're all attacking just you and knocking you out of the game.

743
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:41,364
Speaker 0: Yep.

744
00:42:42,447 --> 00:42:47,203
Speaker 1: I think the strategy, having only played it a few times is to stay the fuck out of Tokyo.

745
00:42:47,444 --> 00:42:51,944
Speaker 0: I agree because the first game I played, I stayed the fuck out of Tokyo and I ended up winning.

746
00:42:51,964 --> 00:42:55,680
Speaker 0: And the second game I was stay in a few times to get points and I just died.

747
00:42:55,901 --> 00:42:57,849
Speaker 1: Now, I wouldn't go for damage either.

748
00:42:57,949 --> 00:42:59,495
Speaker 1: I'd let other players do that.

749
00:42:59,897 --> 00:43:06,021
Speaker 1: Of course, then it's a bringsmanship game, but I would go for energy to buy the superpowers and also a victory point.

750
00:43:06,041 --> 00:43:08,914
Speaker 1: Just get is basically take victory points opportunistically.

751
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:11,868
Speaker 1: So you're trying to be like second place in victory points.

752
00:43:11,888 --> 00:43:17,294
Speaker 1: That way, if someone blitzes toward the end, you can either beat them on the blitz or kill them, but you're not so far behind.

753
00:43:17,314 --> 00:43:18,037
Speaker 1: You can never catch up.

754
00:43:18,057 --> 00:43:21,814
Speaker 1: Like if you roll two threes, go for that third three, get all those victory points.

755
00:43:22,416 --> 00:43:32,533
Speaker 1: But otherwise, go all energy, buy as many superpowers as you can and just be the invincible asshole who wins the game kind of on his own at the end when everyone else is kind of weak.

756
00:43:33,537 --> 00:43:35,344
Speaker 1: I think that is the basic way to win.

757
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,332
Speaker 0: And staying out of Tokyo means you can roll hearts.

758
00:43:37,372 --> 00:43:41,347
Speaker 0: So if you do take damage, you can, you'll be good, right?

759
00:43:41,527 --> 00:43:47,368
Speaker 1: But basically it's a light game, quick to play, quick to teach, could be reboxed into basically a tiny bag.

760
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:47,649
Speaker 1: Yeah.

761
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,859
Speaker 0: And anyone can learn and play this game, right?

762
00:43:49,919 --> 00:43:57,888
Speaker 0: So it's, it's sort of like you can get people who are less gamery to play a game that does have some good strategies in it, right?

763
00:43:57,908 --> 00:43:59,775
Speaker 0: That they normally might be averse to playing.

764
00:44:00,236 --> 00:44:01,240
Speaker 0: The theme is excellent.

765
00:44:01,581 --> 00:44:01,862
Speaker 0: Awesome.

766
00:44:01,902 --> 00:44:02,966
Speaker 0: The art is great.

767
00:44:03,046 --> 00:44:05,155
Speaker 1: The pieces are super high quality, right?

768
00:44:05,175 --> 00:44:07,346
Speaker 0: There's a, there's a monster for every personal taste.

769
00:44:07,406 --> 00:44:09,759
Speaker 0: Like I like all the monsters except King Kong because he's lame.

770
00:44:09,819 --> 00:44:13,214
Speaker 1: I think the Kraken and the evil bunny are my Kraken.

771
00:44:13,956 --> 00:44:14,497
Speaker 1: It's a crack.

772
00:44:14,517 --> 00:44:15,279
Speaker 1: It's a Titan.

773
00:44:17,023 --> 00:44:18,226
Speaker 1: Have you never been mellow?

774
00:44:18,286 --> 00:44:18,647
Speaker 0: Of course.

775
00:44:18,707 --> 00:44:19,249
Speaker 0: I think I pay.

776
00:44:19,449 --> 00:44:23,568
Speaker 0: at first when I saw the cover of the box, you know, cause usually in rampage, I always pick Lizzie.

777
00:44:23,588 --> 00:44:28,167
Speaker 0: So I was thinking I'd either be the Godzilla or I'd be the, uh, the cyber bunny.

778
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:29,352
Speaker 0: Cause I mean cyber, right.

779
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:32,185
Speaker 0: But then when I opened the box, I saw, Oh, there's a crack.

780
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:34,455
Speaker 0: And that's basically just as good as the dinosaur.

781
00:44:34,535 --> 00:44:35,238
Speaker 1: He's got a good face.

782
00:44:35,278 --> 00:44:35,920
Speaker 1: The Godzilla.

783
00:44:36,141 --> 00:44:36,382
Speaker 0: Right.

784
00:44:36,442 --> 00:44:38,370
Speaker 0: And then I saw the Mecca dragon.

785
00:44:38,410 --> 00:44:39,115
Speaker 0: I'm like, wow, fuck.

786
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,845
Speaker 0: I mean that's, you know, that's slightly edges.

787
00:44:40,866 --> 00:44:44,579
Speaker 0: The other ones out, but all of them are great except for the frigging King Kong.

788
00:44:45,422 --> 00:44:50,076
Speaker 1: Now I would compare this actually to skyline that game though.

789
00:44:50,097 --> 00:44:53,508
Speaker 1: I wasn't it like part of the Kickstarter for a ground floor.

790
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:53,729
Speaker 0: Yeah.

791
00:44:53,789 --> 00:44:55,237
Speaker 0: It's much better than ground floor.

792
00:44:55,599 --> 00:44:56,685
Speaker 1: Well, ground floor is a shit game.

793
00:44:56,927 --> 00:45:03,305
Speaker 1: We talked about that, but skyline was kind of fun, but it's basically just a shorter Yahtzee.

794
00:45:03,405 --> 00:45:05,069
Speaker 1: Skyline is to Yahtzee.

795
00:45:05,490 --> 00:45:07,094
Speaker 1: What Euchre is to wis.

796
00:45:08,337 --> 00:45:13,871
Speaker 1: So between skyline and King of Tokyo, I think King of Tokyo is a better game.

797
00:45:14,092 --> 00:45:18,009
Speaker 0: I also agree because skyline didn't have as many of the interactive elements.

798
00:45:18,029 --> 00:45:25,722
Speaker 0: The only interactive elements, the only brings the ship it had was like the one piece left, you know, that extra piece you leave over in the storage or whatever.

799
00:45:25,743 --> 00:45:29,680
Speaker 0: What's it called the leftover bits that someone else can grab all of.

800
00:45:29,740 --> 00:45:29,881
Speaker 0: Right.

801
00:45:29,901 --> 00:45:29,981
Speaker 1: Yeah.

802
00:45:30,001 --> 00:45:30,423
Speaker 1: That was it.

803
00:45:30,583 --> 00:45:30,804
Speaker 0: Yeah.

804
00:45:30,865 --> 00:45:31,186
Speaker 0: That's it.

805
00:45:31,507 --> 00:45:35,824
Speaker 0: Whereas this one, it's like you're directly Yahtzee and need to react to people.

806
00:45:35,884 --> 00:45:36,085
Speaker 0: Right.

807
00:45:36,165 --> 00:45:43,957
Speaker 0: If someone, you know, if you see it's like, you know, if it's depending on who's in Tokyo, you might reroll a claw, you know, not to hurt them.

808
00:45:43,977 --> 00:45:44,379
Speaker 0: Right.

809
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:45,586
Speaker 0: Because they're going to lose anyway.

810
00:45:45,706 --> 00:45:47,334
Speaker 0: You're better off getting some points or something.

811
00:45:47,716 --> 00:45:47,937
Speaker 0: Right.

812
00:45:48,379 --> 00:45:50,488
Speaker 0: Let them stay in there and get killed by someone else.

813
00:45:50,649 --> 00:45:51,472
Speaker 0: You know, is vicious.

814
00:45:51,894 --> 00:45:58,018
Speaker 1: It adds a little bit more sort of randomness, but it's, it's the Yahtzee randomness that's heavily mitigatable by odds.

815
00:45:58,118 --> 00:46:07,209
Speaker 1: You know, exactly the risk you're taking by going for X over Y over Z and the odds of six sided dice are trivial to calculate in your head.

816
00:46:07,229 --> 00:46:08,394
Speaker 1: You don't even need to calculate them.

817
00:46:08,414 --> 00:46:10,482
Speaker 1: You just need to have the rough feel of them.

818
00:46:10,562 --> 00:46:16,742
Speaker 1: I mean, I played Yahtzee from my childhood, probably over a thousand times.

819
00:46:17,906 --> 00:46:19,371
Speaker 1: Cause it was like, it's like the family game.

820
00:46:19,392 --> 00:46:20,699
Speaker 1: Like every family would play it.

821
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,831
Speaker 1: I'd go over to friends' houses and they would all play it.

822
00:46:22,851 --> 00:46:23,977
Speaker 1: Like everyone played Yahtzee.

823
00:46:23,997 --> 00:46:25,847
Speaker 1: We played in school and like elementary school.

824
00:46:25,867 --> 00:46:29,723
Speaker 0: Uh, I had a book of Yahtzee score sheets and they were empty.

825
00:46:29,744 --> 00:46:31,912
Speaker 0: So I had a second book of Yahtzee score sheets.

826
00:46:31,973 --> 00:46:37,615
Speaker 0: So that's how many, it's how many, one Yahtzee score sheet can play Yahtzee like fucking six times on both sides.

827
00:46:37,816 --> 00:46:43,334
Speaker 1: We had a Yahtzee box from the fifties, like late fifties, maybe early sixties.

828
00:46:43,354 --> 00:46:49,441
Speaker 1: Well, we had, we had a triple Yahtzee and the score sheets were all full of like my parents playing it when they were kids.

829
00:46:49,521 --> 00:46:49,762
Speaker 0: Yup.

830
00:46:50,124 --> 00:46:50,264
Speaker 0: Yup.

831
00:46:50,365 --> 00:46:52,835
Speaker 0: I think that was the triple Yahtzee we had was my parents' one.

832
00:46:52,855 --> 00:46:56,232
Speaker 0: And then I think I had another one where I got the second set of score sheets.

833
00:46:56,252 --> 00:46:58,039
Speaker 0: That was a travel Yahtzee.

834
00:46:58,119 --> 00:47:02,898
Speaker 1: When I learned about triple Yahtzee as a kid, I was like, well, it's obviously better than regular Yahtzee.

835
00:47:03,118 --> 00:47:08,336
Speaker 1: So I made my own sheet and then I went to Kinko's and paid to have it duplicated.

836
00:47:08,356 --> 00:47:10,563
Speaker 1: I was very proud of that.

837
00:47:10,884 --> 00:47:18,252
Speaker 1: That same Kinko's refused to let me Xerox pages out of my dungeons and dragon cyclopedia because that would be copyright infringement.

838
00:47:19,315 --> 00:47:28,450
Speaker 1: That was in the early days when copy machines and Kinko's were not exactly common and no one really knew, like people were afraid of Kinko's for copyright stuff.

839
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:40,413
Speaker 1: And Kinko's really weird about that, but yeah, this is a, this is the kind of game that if you go to conventions or are commonly introducing games to other people like, Hey, would you like to play a game?

840
00:47:40,815 --> 00:47:42,662
Speaker 1: or Hey, you've come over to my party.

841
00:47:42,984 --> 00:47:45,353
Speaker 1: Let's play a light game while we wait for people to show up.

842
00:47:45,875 --> 00:47:46,919
Speaker 1: This is your game.

843
00:47:46,979 --> 00:47:47,641
Speaker 1: Just buy it.

844
00:47:48,304 --> 00:47:49,328
Speaker 1: It's also a great game.

845
00:47:49,388 --> 00:47:57,177
Speaker 1: If you want to introduce games like this to your kids, a kid who is too young for Yahtzee, even though I think six year olds can play Yahtzee just fine.

846
00:47:57,538 --> 00:48:01,214
Speaker 0: If you can count and you can, if you can play poker, you can play Yahtzee.

847
00:48:01,255 --> 00:48:01,376
Speaker 0: Right.

848
00:48:01,396 --> 00:48:08,381
Speaker 1: And I was like, my grandpa taught me poker and I was like, young kids who might not be interested in Yahtzee will play this because you're a monster.

849
00:48:08,481 --> 00:48:16,143
Speaker 1: You're got some after references to old robot movies and old monster movies.

850
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:18,513
Speaker 1: And it's just very well done for what it is.

851
00:48:18,614 --> 00:48:19,820
Speaker 1: And it's not that expensive.

852
00:48:19,860 --> 00:48:24,921
Speaker 1: A lot of times games that are of this caliber cost way more than this for no good reason.

853
00:48:25,223 --> 00:48:25,363
Speaker 0: Yeah.

854
00:48:25,383 --> 00:48:30,245
Speaker 0: What I think it really is, is just that, you know, there are these certain games that are like the warmup game, right?

855
00:48:30,346 --> 00:48:34,242
Speaker 0: And you think of it as like a spotted or something along those lines, right?

856
00:48:34,403 --> 00:48:36,873
Speaker 0: But those games I think are almost too light, right?

857
00:48:36,893 --> 00:48:40,750
Speaker 0: They don't really, you know, get you sitting at a table to play a board game.

858
00:48:41,052 --> 00:48:43,686
Speaker 0: They don't really get you doing any sort of strategies or anything.

859
00:48:43,746 --> 00:48:43,927
Speaker 0: Right.

860
00:48:43,967 --> 00:48:46,921
Speaker 0: And they get, because they're so light, they get too much play.

861
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:48,589
Speaker 0: I think those are better for the standup.

862
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,879
Speaker 0: You know, we really don't have time for a game.

863
00:48:50,919 --> 00:48:52,245
Speaker 0: Let's play spot it.

864
00:48:52,305 --> 00:48:52,506
Speaker 0: Right.

865
00:48:52,767 --> 00:48:56,042
Speaker 0: I think this is really a real warmup game, right?

866
00:48:56,082 --> 00:49:10,459
Speaker 0: You still get the people sitting at the table, you know, playing the game properly, and then you can switch to a real game once they're sitting there like that as it's much harder to switch into a Puerto Rico from a spot it than it is switch from a king of Tokyo to a Puerto Rico.

867
00:49:10,519 --> 00:49:10,720
Speaker 1: Yup.

868
00:49:11,282 --> 00:49:16,566
Speaker 1: And it's so quick to teach that you can get the people who normally wouldn't play a game to just, Oh, I'll play it.

869
00:49:16,827 --> 00:49:18,655
Speaker 1: You'll be done with the whole game in 20 minutes.

870
00:49:19,016 --> 00:49:20,722
Speaker 1: Plus five minutes of teaching tops.

871
00:49:21,084 --> 00:49:21,746
Speaker 0: Yeah.

872
00:49:21,867 --> 00:49:22,810
Speaker 0: And nerds like the themes.

873
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:25,261
Speaker 0: You can get nerds to play is even if they're not board game people.

874
00:49:25,502 --> 00:49:25,703
Speaker 0: Yup.

875
00:49:25,824 --> 00:49:26,105
Speaker 0: You know?

876
00:49:26,889 --> 00:49:30,902
Speaker 1: So, but seriously, if you want to be good at games, you haven't played Yahtzee.

877
00:49:31,545 --> 00:49:32,588
Speaker 1: play Yahtzee.

878
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:34,917
Speaker 1: You don't even need to play it with other people.

879
00:49:35,178 --> 00:49:36,663
Speaker 1: Just play it by yourself.

880
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,450
Speaker 0: I played some solo Yahtzees.

881
00:49:38,990 --> 00:49:40,413
Speaker 1: I played many a solo Yahtzee.

882
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:48,849
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

883
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:52,502
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and brand.

884
00:49:52,543 --> 00:49:52,844
Speaker 1: Okay.

885
00:49:52,904 --> 00:49:53,728
Speaker 1: For the logos.

886
00:49:53,929 --> 00:49:58,988
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at front row crew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

887
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,881
Speaker 1: Remember geek nights is not one, but four different shows.

888
00:50:02,042 --> 00:50:06,663
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, gaming Tuesdays, anime comic Wednesdays, and indiscriminate Thursdays.

889
00:50:06,984 --> 00:50:09,916
Speaker 0: geek nights is distributed under a creative comments attribution.

890
00:50:09,916 --> 00:50:11,000
Speaker 0: 3.0 license.

891
00:50:11,402 --> 00:50:14,495
Speaker 0: geek nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

892
00:50:14,676 --> 00:50:17,590
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows it's actually recorded at night.
