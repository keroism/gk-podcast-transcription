1
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,840
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday December 27th, and this is Geek Vines.

2
00:00:14,562 --> 00:00:17,610
Speaker 1: Tonight, we talk about the first-person shooters.

3
00:00:19,652 --> 00:00:27,149
Speaker 1: Let's do this so you might be familiar with the sort of slash dot competitor dig.

4
00:00:28,492 --> 00:00:35,386
Speaker 1: The way it works compared to slash dot is that instead of where slash dot you submit a story and then you know the editors Pick and choose it goes in the front page.

5
00:00:35,931 --> 00:00:37,035
Speaker 1: Dig is more democratic.

6
00:00:37,075 --> 00:00:41,130
Speaker 1: you can just kind of dig something and you know you submit something and everyone can see it.

7
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,849
Speaker 1: And if they dig it and enough people dig it it gets to the front page.

8
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:45,034
Speaker 0: It's both good and bad.

9
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:48,850
Speaker 0: it has its pros and cons and some people like slash dot some like dig most people use both.

10
00:00:49,151 --> 00:00:49,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, I look at both.

11
00:00:50,377 --> 00:00:52,910
Speaker 1: usually digs a little faster slash that has good comments, whatever.

12
00:00:54,291 --> 00:01:02,459
Speaker 1: So I was unable to dig my own site and do things with dig and it was because I messed up some networking Configuration because it wasn't well documented at all.

13
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:07,724
Speaker 1: so I fixed it and I tried to get on dig For with a with an entry on my site.

14
00:01:08,408 --> 00:01:16,312
Speaker 1: now I have a bunch of game pro magazines like ten years worth don't ask me why and When.

15
00:01:16,353 --> 00:01:19,729
Speaker 1: I was cleaning them up and getting ready to sell them on eBay which I'm gonna do soon.

16
00:01:20,612 --> 00:01:25,849
Speaker 1: I noticed in one of them that there was a little in the in the lab section where they talk about controllers and stuff.

17
00:01:26,935 --> 00:01:34,390
Speaker 1: There was a little blurb really tiny About this third-party PlayStation 1 controller, and it looked really familiar.

18
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:39,090
Speaker 1: It looked exactly like I don't know a PlayStation 3 controller.

19
00:01:40,313 --> 00:01:41,930
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, we found that interesting.

20
00:01:44,314 --> 00:01:51,589
Speaker 1: Yep, so I took a picture of it and I put it on my site and I wrote a little thing about it And I said, you know, this is something I could get digged or dug.

21
00:01:52,751 --> 00:01:55,322
Speaker 0: so they dug dig that.

22
00:01:55,342 --> 00:02:01,068
Speaker 1: so I dug it and as I watched it got more digs and a little more digs.

23
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:08,963
Speaker 1: and Then I went away and I came back and an old pile of digs and my blog had a whole Pile of comments and I was like whoo fair.

24
00:02:09,002 --> 00:02:10,026
Speaker 1: I got the front page of dig.

25
00:02:10,067 --> 00:02:10,489
Speaker 1: I'm awesome.

26
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:14,341
Speaker 1: And yeah, it was pretty cool.

27
00:02:15,084 --> 00:02:15,385
Speaker 0: That's it.

28
00:02:15,405 --> 00:02:16,470
Speaker 0: That's all you have to say about that.

29
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:24,402
Speaker 1: well, no, the interesting part was that when I looked at the stats I got about 10,000 people came to the site to look at it.

30
00:02:24,423 --> 00:02:37,981
Speaker 1: I got about 400 digs and I got about 16 comments on my blog about 50 comments on dig and none of those people spilled over into geek nights.

31
00:02:38,644 --> 00:02:42,671
Speaker 1: No, not really and I Didn't.

32
00:02:42,831 --> 00:02:48,270
Speaker 1: yeah, I got a quite a few maybe a few hundred people subscribe to my RSS feed for my blog, which is cool.

33
00:02:49,052 --> 00:02:50,937
Speaker 1: So the numbers are really like way out.

34
00:02:51,038 --> 00:02:57,597
Speaker 1: It's like only about 10% of the people who come and visit will Click on your RSS feed.

35
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,650
Speaker 1: at least of the dig population and Like out of 10,000 people only 400 will actually click dig it.

36
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:08,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot of like I use dig.

37
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,384
Speaker 0: I never log in.

38
00:03:09,425 --> 00:03:10,330
Speaker 0: I've never dug anything.

39
00:03:10,572 --> 00:03:12,465
Speaker 0: I just look at the site and see what other people have dug.

40
00:03:13,008 --> 00:03:17,670
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, that's if you really just want to read the news and use it the way you slash that.

41
00:03:18,132 --> 00:03:18,775
Speaker 1: That's all you got to do.

42
00:03:18,956 --> 00:03:20,483
Speaker 0: It's like slash down for the longest time.

43
00:03:20,503 --> 00:03:22,070
Speaker 0: I never had an account or anything.

44
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:24,399
Speaker 0: I just went to the site every day and looked at the front page.

45
00:03:24,881 --> 00:03:27,010
Speaker 1: dig has some some hidden functions though.

46
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,928
Speaker 1: They're like if you get into it, you can do cool stuff.

47
00:03:29,556 --> 00:03:37,750
Speaker 1: you just have to get into it like you can dig stuff and like everything you dig will go into like your digs and you can undig stuff.

48
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:41,389
Speaker 1: and Yeah, it's all kind of crazy stuff going on in there.

49
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:45,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is really missing is the nice commentary you get on a site like slash down.

50
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:49,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, the comments on dig are like non-hierarchical and there's no moderation.

51
00:03:50,004 --> 00:03:50,907
Speaker 1: So you just get like these.

52
00:03:50,987 --> 00:03:53,538
Speaker 1: it looks like a blog And there's a bunch of people like woot.

53
00:03:53,558 --> 00:03:54,080
Speaker 1: This sucks.

54
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:55,226
Speaker 1: No dig.

55
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:58,681
Speaker 1: No dig Random crap it might as well be fart.

56
00:03:58,902 --> 00:04:02,133
Speaker 0: one word put now FARC is more Lucid than dig.

57
00:04:02,174 --> 00:04:06,550
Speaker 0: sometimes sometimes people post freaking essays to FARC and flame wars.

58
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:10,323
Speaker 1: If dig put the comments and the moderating the way slash that does.

59
00:04:10,384 --> 00:04:14,629
Speaker 1: but also with the web 2.0 I think slash I'll be pretty much useless.

60
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:18,002
Speaker 1: But for now as we need still need slash done.

61
00:04:18,284 --> 00:04:21,464
Speaker 1: Yeah for now for now You know, but they should slash.

62
00:04:21,483 --> 00:04:22,450
Speaker 1: that should also if slash.

63
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:29,680
Speaker 1: I took a lesson from dig and they made a web 2.0 site and they got rid of all their stupid ads Everywhere that no one likes ads.

64
00:04:30,142 --> 00:04:41,189
Speaker 0: Yeah, the ones we don't see that we know Obviously, I always forget the slash that has ads and then every now and then I use like someone else's computer and I see an A and it's painful and it startles me.

65
00:04:41,412 --> 00:04:48,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if you know They did all the stuff that dig does like the firing their editors and just using a democratic system then dig would die.

66
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:50,393
Speaker 1: So whatever.

67
00:04:51,216 --> 00:04:54,567
Speaker 1: but the point is I got dug and now I know the formula for getting dug.

68
00:04:54,607 --> 00:04:55,951
Speaker 1: and what will happen if I get Dug, yep.

69
00:04:57,094 --> 00:05:02,450
Speaker 0: So luckily if geek nights gets dug we won't probably go over our bandwidth limit right away.

70
00:05:02,651 --> 00:05:11,313
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I barely used any bandwidth and CPU me my site the way I have it set up is so slick It doesn't even I could get a serious like pounding Yeah your site.

71
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:15,830
Speaker 0: but if 10,000 people downloaded geek night suddenly with all the mp3 would be a problem.

72
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:18,943
Speaker 0: Yeah, 20 megabytes times 10,000 is a lot of bandwidth.

73
00:05:19,324 --> 00:05:20,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's alright.

74
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:24,459
Speaker 1: so Buddy, uh, Elliot spitzer.

75
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:29,775
Speaker 1: He's read it again the Attorney General of New York He's going to get some more bad guys.

76
00:05:30,136 --> 00:05:34,770
Speaker 1: Well, actually he's getting the same bad guys again, you know those record companies.

77
00:05:35,052 --> 00:05:41,964
Speaker 0: Yeah, he left him a nice Christmas gift the Christmas gift of Lawsuits Oh subpoenas.

78
00:05:42,387 --> 00:05:50,596
Speaker 1: Haha Yeah, so he's kind of pissed about their Price fix well before he got him for CD price fixing.

79
00:05:51,277 --> 00:05:52,540
Speaker 1: now, he's getting them for online.

80
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:55,162
Speaker 1: You know iTunes price fixing.

81
00:05:55,323 --> 00:05:57,794
Speaker 1: and I say yeah They are fixing the prices.

82
00:05:58,075 --> 00:06:03,707
Speaker 1: CDs are worth nothing and music is worth nothing and they're selling it at more than nothing Which well, it's not even fixed.

83
00:06:04,091 --> 00:06:12,890
Speaker 0: His point is that he's saying that they're artificially Inflating the prices to make him uniform or more than the wholesale value would be and the RIAs response was that?

84
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:15,638
Speaker 0: Our prices are perfectly valid and they're perfectly varied.

85
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:22,240
Speaker 0: the price of a song on the wholesale can range from 60 to 90 Cents and Elliot said that's not enough.

86
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:23,686
Speaker 0: That's not enough variance.

87
00:06:23,786 --> 00:06:32,230
Speaker 1: It's obviously collusion Yep, and the other thing is if you ever look on the there were lots of websites even RI a website.

88
00:06:32,350 --> 00:06:37,308
Speaker 1: there was a website made by the RA that says this is the breakdown of all the money you pay for a CD.

89
00:06:37,368 --> 00:06:44,111
Speaker 1: right and the number one item is Marketing and Advertising.

90
00:06:44,132 --> 00:06:44,693
Speaker 1: and all that is.

91
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:51,797
Speaker 1: the is most of the cost of a CD is to pay to advertise that CD to get people to Buy it now.

92
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:55,585
Speaker 1: I'd like to point out two things about that number one.

93
00:06:56,892 --> 00:07:00,810
Speaker 1: The only CDs that actually get marketed are like the super super hits.

94
00:07:01,712 --> 00:07:07,630
Speaker 1: You won't see like the normal Joe Schmoe's CD get marketed at all, but his CD cost the same.

95
00:07:08,373 --> 00:07:12,790
Speaker 1: So when you buy Joe Schmoe's CD from a record label you're paying to advertise.

96
00:07:13,514 --> 00:07:18,614
Speaker 1: You know the freakin pop stars CD Advertise Joe Schmoe's CD.

97
00:07:18,715 --> 00:07:31,589
Speaker 0: It's interesting that for some reason the CDs that could advertise more get bought more You think doesn't seem to have so much to do with the quality of the music But it seems to have a lot to do with how much they market it.

98
00:07:31,770 --> 00:07:43,530
Speaker 1: Well, that's because the the way their business model works is they can make more money selling a bunch of copies of a few CDs Instead of the same number of copies total, but more CDs, so that's how they operate.

99
00:07:44,134 --> 00:07:47,633
Speaker 1: But the second thing I wanted to point out is that Why don't?

100
00:07:47,874 --> 00:07:48,918
Speaker 1: why do they market at all?

101
00:07:49,681 --> 00:07:51,710
Speaker 1: the mp3 trading is the marketing?

102
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,840
Speaker 1: That's what everyone's trying to tell them that they don't get.

103
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:55,870
Speaker 1: you don't need to advertise music.

104
00:07:56,111 --> 00:08:03,058
Speaker 1: Just put it on the internet for free and people will discover it and once they tell you what they're going to buy That's what you make.

105
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:08,883
Speaker 1: instead of telling people what to buy Let them tell you and you can make a zillion dollars just the same.

106
00:08:09,204 --> 00:08:16,770
Speaker 0: or put out a bunch of singles from like all these Different bands whatever see which ones get downloaded the most and then sell for a reasonable price albums from that band.

107
00:08:17,332 --> 00:08:18,539
Speaker 1: You don't have to pay for marketing.

108
00:08:18,579 --> 00:08:20,750
Speaker 1: you could sell the CD for like five bucks.

109
00:08:21,071 --> 00:08:22,658
Speaker 1: Hell you could make a super audio CD.

110
00:08:22,698 --> 00:08:25,490
Speaker 1: I'd pay five bucks for a super audio CD with surround sound and shit.

111
00:08:25,731 --> 00:08:26,614
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't pay.

112
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:30,890
Speaker 1: maybe I'd pay two bucks for a real CD, but you know that's what you got to do.

113
00:08:31,191 --> 00:08:32,360
Speaker 1: That's what everyone's been telling you to do.

114
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,024
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

115
00:08:33,085 --> 00:08:35,907
Speaker 1: They're so dumb Oh my god, and Ellie Spitzer's gonna kick their ass.

116
00:08:36,149 --> 00:08:46,475
Speaker 0: yeah I mean they really have no case here, and I they've issued a bunch of statements saying oh, don't worry This isn't a big deal to their stockholders, but if you actually read those statements I'm gonna bother quoting them.

117
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:48,041
Speaker 0: just they honest.

118
00:08:48,061 --> 00:08:51,596
Speaker 0: they obviously either don't realize the trouble They're in or trying to pretend.

119
00:08:51,616 --> 00:08:53,524
Speaker 0: They're not in trouble long enough to sell some stock.

120
00:08:54,046 --> 00:08:58,689
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah Spitzer likes to kick people in the ass.

121
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:06,052
Speaker 1: He's great in fact as he's read the only politician that I actually say yeah, go get him Like.

122
00:09:06,233 --> 00:09:16,170
Speaker 0: a lot of people are wondering about Elliot Spitzer because he seems to only be taking high-profile Cases that will get people riled up and get his name out there, and that he's just doing this to be elected governor.

123
00:09:17,171 --> 00:09:22,770
Speaker 0: But you know what if someone has a sinister purpose and does good along the way?

124
00:09:23,192 --> 00:09:25,969
Speaker 0: The good is fine, and you stop them when they do the sinister yep.

125
00:09:26,693 --> 00:09:30,850
Speaker 1: I mean it doesn't matter why he's doing the good as long as he's doing it.

126
00:09:30,930 --> 00:09:31,373
Speaker 1: And you know what.

127
00:09:31,413 --> 00:09:33,043
Speaker 1: that's how democracy is supposed to work.

128
00:09:33,104 --> 00:09:34,070
Speaker 1: is that no matter?

129
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,214
Speaker 1: Who's the representative?

130
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:38,669
Speaker 1: is that they're supposed to want to do the things that people?

131
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,649
Speaker 1: That their constituents want them to do so that they stay in office?

132
00:09:43,031 --> 00:09:43,975
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter.

133
00:09:44,015 --> 00:09:50,402
Speaker 0: he's just doing it to stay in office or like say some guy's a pervert And he really gets off on putting money in poor boxes.

134
00:09:50,843 --> 00:09:51,024
Speaker 0: Hey.

135
00:09:51,044 --> 00:09:52,410
Speaker 0: He's still putting money in poor boxes.

136
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:53,637
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter why he's doing it.

137
00:09:53,979 --> 00:09:54,261
Speaker 1: Yeah.

138
00:09:54,402 --> 00:09:55,810
Speaker 1: He's doing it because he gets off.

139
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:56,413
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

140
00:09:56,433 --> 00:09:57,136
Speaker 1: he's helping the poor.

141
00:09:57,197 --> 00:09:58,343
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz the good still happens.

142
00:09:58,624 --> 00:10:05,950
Speaker 1: in fact people Politicians are supposed to do good things that their constituents want them to do only because that will get them reelected.

143
00:10:06,312 --> 00:10:10,316
Speaker 0: You know I wouldn't mind so much if they even did bad things But they had good intentions.

144
00:10:10,617 --> 00:10:13,209
Speaker 0: it always seems that they have bad intentions, and they do bad things.

145
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:16,201
Speaker 0: It's like the worst possible outcome every time.

146
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:17,628
Speaker 1: that's how it seems.

147
00:10:17,869 --> 00:10:19,534
Speaker 1: yeah I think a lot of the problem is.

148
00:10:19,574 --> 00:10:29,101
Speaker 1: I think a lot of What they're doing are good and do good.

149
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,990
Speaker 1: the problem is they believe things that are factually incorrect.

150
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:46,190
Speaker 0: Well like look at the one who put forth that the latest horrible DRM Whatever legislation that we talked about a while ago He issued a statement saying he got a lot of flack from geeks in his email And he's mad because they accused him of taking bribes from the industry.

151
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:49,210
Speaker 0: And he said that no I'm doing this because it's a just cause blah blah.

152
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:52,730
Speaker 0: And he wrote this thing about how you got to protect the rights of the artist versus the rights.

153
00:10:53,072 --> 00:11:08,008
Speaker 0: And he talked about how he stands up for the artists too, and he doesn't like the industry But you can't just steal from him, and it looked like a real well-reasoned article, but then if you look around He accepted like tens of thousands of dollars from the RIAA right before he sponsored that law.

154
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:08,610
Speaker 1: yep.

155
00:11:08,851 --> 00:11:16,521
Speaker 0: So even if he didn't actually do it because of that donation It looks really bad, and he probably shouldn't have accepted the donation.

156
00:11:17,283 --> 00:11:18,627
Speaker 1: see you know sometimes.

157
00:11:18,687 --> 00:11:21,099
Speaker 1: I think yeah, okay That's what happens, and you know what.

158
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,710
Speaker 1: probably sometimes that is what happens.

159
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:32,513
Speaker 1: But also you got to wonder I mean if I'm a politician right you don't actually talk to people People send you donations, and it just goes into the bank You don't actually like.

160
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:37,290
Speaker 0: actually a lot of times you do talk to people you'll have like special fundraising dinners.

161
00:11:37,735 --> 00:11:38,749
Speaker 1: Oh, well yeah, yeah, yeah.

162
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:46,403
Speaker 1: But I mean you know what if the RIAA's if I'm a politician like a senator and the RIAA Sends me a check, and it just goes right into my bank account.

163
00:11:46,463 --> 00:11:51,346
Speaker 1: I might even know about it I might not know that I accepted actually there because there's that was actually.

164
00:11:51,366 --> 00:12:05,975
Speaker 0: I learned about a problem that Police had with that where people would put money in a police officer's account and try to get him for bribery and stuff and you you can get bank accounts where no one can deposit money without your signature and It's trivial to do so.

165
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:07,020
Speaker 0: any bank will do it.

166
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:15,592
Speaker 1: so any politician who says he didn't know yeah But I mean the people in your office Would you just get a pile of checks and they just stamp them all with a thing and then they that's fine cuz that's your Signature.

167
00:12:16,053 --> 00:12:22,573
Speaker 1: yeah, but that's what I'm saying is that you personally don't realize that you took a check from the RIAA But you know what.

168
00:12:22,914 --> 00:12:26,325
Speaker 0: if that's the case then why is the RIAA giving you money if you don't even know it?

169
00:12:26,345 --> 00:12:28,291
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

170
00:12:28,712 --> 00:12:33,950
Speaker 1: Maybe it's because he was on their side that they gave him money and not the other way around.

171
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:34,392
Speaker 0: I don't know.

172
00:12:34,472 --> 00:12:37,950
Speaker 0: cuz it now I look through and it doesn't seem like this was an issue for him until recently.

173
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:39,957
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not saying that's how it is in fact.

174
00:12:39,997 --> 00:12:43,810
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure he is sort of you know legally bribing whatever.

175
00:12:43,991 --> 00:12:48,326
Speaker 1: But I'm just trying to say that it's not a hundred percent, and yeah, it's not a hundred percent, but you know what.

176
00:12:48,527 --> 00:12:52,475
Speaker 1: it's 90% That's for sure All right.

177
00:12:52,837 --> 00:12:58,971
Speaker 1: though in other non-us news Galileo you mean the guy who said Gravity.

178
00:12:59,474 --> 00:13:00,098
Speaker 0: no, I mean.

179
00:13:00,319 --> 00:13:01,768
Speaker 1: I mean you know things fall at the same.

180
00:13:01,788 --> 00:13:07,059
Speaker 0: the GPS So I don't know how many of you know, but GPS.

181
00:13:07,319 --> 00:13:10,550
Speaker 0: You know a global positioning system is run by the US government.

182
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:15,921
Speaker 1: I thought it was a bunch of like Geo stationary satellites owned by all different people all.

183
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:16,845
Speaker 0: no no no they're all.

184
00:13:16,905 --> 00:13:18,030
Speaker 0: it's all run by the government.

185
00:13:18,150 --> 00:13:19,456
Speaker 1: Then why are there so many different systems?

186
00:13:19,496 --> 00:13:20,179
Speaker 1: for they're not.

187
00:13:20,259 --> 00:13:21,283
Speaker 0: they're all GPS.

188
00:13:21,323 --> 00:13:22,127
Speaker 0: It's all the same.

189
00:13:22,528 --> 00:13:22,809
Speaker 1: it is

190
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:48,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can do GPS type stuff with cell towers and like triangulation, but GPS the official GPS is Has a heavy hand from the government because they have the ability one they limit the accuracy of it to within one meter Usually or ten meters depending and whenever there's a war or whenever the government of the United States decides that it doesn't want you to Know for whatever reason like say it's about to invade it where

191
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:49,408
Speaker 1: you are.

192
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:51,036
Speaker 0: Well say they don't want.

193
00:13:51,378 --> 00:13:53,650
Speaker 0: you'd say like a lot of militaries use GPS.

194
00:13:54,531 --> 00:14:01,912
Speaker 0: Yeah, so right before we invaded Iraq the US military put fake information in the GPS in the whole Middle East Mm-hmm.

195
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:09,629
Speaker 0: so all the militaries who relied on it couldn't use it and They reserved the right to pretty much just turn off GPS whenever they want.

196
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:12,369
Speaker 0: So Europe said hey, that's not cool.

197
00:14:12,815 --> 00:14:20,550
Speaker 0: We're gonna make a better GPS that anyone can use that will never be turned off for any reason and it'll also be more accurate and faster and more reliable.

198
00:14:21,211 --> 00:14:21,856
Speaker 0: Cool do it.

199
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:27,330
Speaker 0: and the United States said fine But we reserve the right to shoot it down if a whore if a hostile power ever uses it against us.

200
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,117
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Okay, here.

201
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:32,781
Speaker 1: This is you know what.

202
00:14:32,801 --> 00:14:36,660
Speaker 1: if I was Europe you know what I would say That satellite is our property.

203
00:14:36,941 --> 00:14:43,490
Speaker 1: if you shoot down our satellite We're going to shoot down all of your satellites, and we're going to shoot missiles at you because that's a declaration of war.

204
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:45,699
Speaker 0: You realize that's not gonna happen.

205
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:47,989
Speaker 1: I know but that's what someone with balls would say.

206
00:14:49,591 --> 00:14:53,270
Speaker 0: See but the problem is think situations like that or what leads to world wars.

207
00:14:53,551 --> 00:14:54,976
Speaker 0: That's what led to World War one and two.

208
00:14:55,237 --> 00:14:58,710
Speaker 0: it was people posturing like that and then finally everyone just retaliated.

209
00:14:58,790 --> 00:14:59,292
Speaker 1: And you know what?

210
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:00,075
Speaker 1: some you know what.

211
00:15:00,196 --> 00:15:04,890
Speaker 1: in World Wars one and two there were fuckers and the first time it was a Kaiser And you know what okay?

212
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:11,109
Speaker 1: Whatever, but the Kaiser was kind of a fucker and in two it was Hitler and Hitler was a real fucker And he had to get rid of the fuckers.

213
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:13,661
Speaker 1: You know what the u.s.. Now is kind of a fucker.

214
00:15:13,681 --> 00:15:17,518
Speaker 0: all right with World War two you're spot-on But you World War one.

215
00:15:17,558 --> 00:15:20,190
Speaker 0: I don't really want to bust your balls here, but he wasn't alright.

216
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:22,610
Speaker 1: The Kaiser wasn't as bad as you know.

217
00:15:23,471 --> 00:15:24,197
Speaker 0: Which Kaiser?

218
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,347
Speaker 0: what are you talking about?

219
00:15:25,367 --> 00:15:25,629
Speaker 0: Wilhelm?

220
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, he did.

221
00:15:28,456 --> 00:15:35,649
Speaker 1: World War one wasn't really started by Germany I know, but he was still kind of you know not so good.

222
00:15:36,171 --> 00:15:41,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, he wasn't the greatest guy, but mostly because he wasn't the smartest leader not because he was terribly belligerent.

223
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:45,101
Speaker 1: No, he wasn't really evil, but you know it wasn't exact.

224
00:15:45,141 --> 00:15:46,345
Speaker 1: It's kind of like Saddam.

225
00:15:46,686 --> 00:15:53,611
Speaker 1: Saddam wasn't great But he wasn't like the Ayatollah Khomeini or like with those bad bad guys You know.

226
00:15:53,691 --> 00:16:00,175
Speaker 0: but getting rid of him wasn't so bad, but World War one basically started because of escalations in tension Like you said.

227
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:02,105
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, it didn't start because of the.

228
00:16:02,145 --> 00:16:04,961
Speaker 0: you don't shoot missiles Just because someone shot down your satellite.

229
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:07,534
Speaker 1: if someone shot down my satellite I shoot down their satellite.

230
00:16:07,594 --> 00:16:13,034
Speaker 0: You know maybe well the thing is no one can shoot down satellites, but us oh Not easily.

231
00:16:13,054 --> 00:16:19,341
Speaker 1: I should please you put up a satellite that has a laser to shoot other satellites one That's that violates international law.

232
00:16:19,683 --> 00:16:20,367
Speaker 1: no one has to know.

233
00:16:21,290 --> 00:16:22,972
Speaker 1: Yeah Doesn't matter.

234
00:16:23,032 --> 00:16:26,263
Speaker 1: cuz shooting down Europe satellites by relates international law.

235
00:16:26,303 --> 00:16:27,988
Speaker 0: well that the I've read articles.

236
00:16:28,008 --> 00:16:32,449
Speaker 0: basically the way They do it is they just have a big heavy satellite up there that they just ran into it.

237
00:16:32,771 --> 00:16:33,856
Speaker 0: So it's not really a weapon.

238
00:16:33,896 --> 00:16:36,648
Speaker 0: It's just a big heavy satellite that get.

239
00:16:36,669 --> 00:16:36,829
Speaker 0: dude.

240
00:16:37,090 --> 00:16:39,318
Speaker 1: That's gonna be the future of space wars.

241
00:16:39,378 --> 00:16:42,889
Speaker 1: It's just big chunks of metal with rockets on them slamming into each other.

242
00:16:43,431 --> 00:16:44,314
Speaker 1: That'll be so great.

243
00:16:44,334 --> 00:16:46,642
Speaker 0: I mean it's not something that's ever happened before.

244
00:16:46,722 --> 00:16:48,830
Speaker 0: conflict hasn't really entered space yet.

245
00:16:49,411 --> 00:17:02,693
Speaker 0: but I mean because China and Russia are backing this Galileo system heavily and plan to use it and If the u.s.. Ever enters conflict with Russia again or with China which while I'm not gonna be a crazy conspiracy guy and say yeah We're gonna go to war with China.

246
00:17:03,175 --> 00:17:07,589
Speaker 0: It's possible that within the next 40 years there might be some low-scale conflict between the two powers.

247
00:17:09,251 --> 00:17:16,174
Speaker 0: There's a good chance the u.s.. Might attack European satellite infrastructure as a part of that mmm trouble.

248
00:17:16,678 --> 00:17:19,575
Speaker 0: at least from a geek perspective Galileo is awesome.

249
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,565
Speaker 0: It is far superior to the current GPS.

250
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:23,789
Speaker 1: You know we should do.

251
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:35,130
Speaker 1: See as technology gets smaller and easier and more accessible Eventually us nerds be able to put up our own GPS is because right now It's like before it was computers.

252
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:36,976
Speaker 1: They were big things that only cut.

253
00:17:36,996 --> 00:17:40,648
Speaker 1: you know like countries had him and big companies had him and they were huge.

254
00:17:40,929 --> 00:17:41,672
Speaker 0: wait You're saying.

255
00:17:41,712 --> 00:17:46,730
Speaker 0: everyone's saying the geeks are gonna be able to just put up geosynchronous orbit satellites.

256
00:17:47,192 --> 00:17:50,810
Speaker 1: Look in 1920 if I would have told you everyone would have had like five.

257
00:17:51,731 --> 00:17:53,135
Speaker 0: There's a big difference from that.

258
00:17:53,196 --> 00:17:57,210
Speaker 0: there's no physical space limitation to how many computers you can have in the world.

259
00:17:58,050 --> 00:17:59,397
Speaker 0: No realistic one anyway.

260
00:17:59,417 --> 00:18:01,909
Speaker 1: What if one day satellites are like the size of a pea?

261
00:18:03,591 --> 00:18:04,696
Speaker 1: At the rate we're going to will.

262
00:18:04,716 --> 00:18:07,850
Speaker 0: in that case why do you even need a satellite if you have the technology to do that?

263
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:10,269
Speaker 0: There are far better ways to send data than satellites.

264
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:12,810
Speaker 1: So because the satellite can figure out where you are.

265
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:13,954
Speaker 1: That's the point of the satellite.

266
00:18:13,994 --> 00:18:18,090
Speaker 0: you can figure out where you are as long as you have multiple points of reference and precise timing.

267
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:19,135
Speaker 0: All they're all this.

268
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:21,990
Speaker 0: all the GPS is is multiple points of reference and precise timing.

269
00:18:22,331 --> 00:18:27,390
Speaker 0: That's all you need was a satellite for because that makes it easier to give it to a large area unhindered.

270
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:29,501
Speaker 1: See that's the point of it.

271
00:18:29,521 --> 00:18:38,647
Speaker 0: Yeah whatever Leary of your ultra optimistic idea that somehow we'll be able to love are some geeks.

272
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:42,009
Speaker 0: within our lifetimes They'll be able to launch geosynchronous satellites into orbit all right.

273
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:52,069
Speaker 1: well My point is is that in in a number of years within our lifetime This will become irrelevant because everyone will have awesome GPS because it'll just be you know consumer technology

274
00:18:52,572 --> 00:18:53,056
Speaker 0: as opposed to

275
00:18:55,372 --> 00:18:56,395
Speaker 1: Military technology,

276
00:18:56,556 --> 00:19:00,328
Speaker 0: I wonder if the US will put export limitations on it like they did with encryption back in the day.

277
00:19:00,629 --> 00:19:01,987
Speaker 1: lol Yeah, rofl.

278
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:18,380
Speaker 1: So our things of the day are both videos today Yeah, the this one that I got I saw real early in the morning, and it was mad freaky.

279
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you ever seen speedgrapher.

280
00:19:21,943 --> 00:19:23,439
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's that character.

281
00:19:27,181 --> 00:19:32,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, we can make about a lot of jokes about that, but so apparently that character is real and is in this video.

282
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:37,635
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's his lady dancing, and I don't know where she's from looks like Eastern Europe.

283
00:19:37,675 --> 00:19:47,680
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't know but She's really really flexible like perhaps the most flexible person on earth, and she flexes in ways that make you go.

284
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:47,864
Speaker 1: Whoa.

285
00:19:49,781 --> 00:19:55,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a little queasy watching it cuz I thought about trying to do that to my body and imagining how it would break.

286
00:19:56,022 --> 00:20:02,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, like she like flips her legs and put somewhere arms should be and then it's real scary.

287
00:20:02,781 --> 00:20:10,240
Speaker 1: And like the way like mostly the torso movements cuz like it's like each like she has torso joints that other people don't have.

288
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:12,253
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like a wave.

289
00:20:12,293 --> 00:20:13,219
Speaker 0: It's all googly.

290
00:20:13,941 --> 00:20:18,595
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like your vertebrae like her spine is just like a piece of licorice or something.

291
00:20:19,077 --> 00:20:23,669
Speaker 1: it's freaky But anyway watch the video and be amazed.

292
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:24,953
Speaker 1: yeah and be afraid.

293
00:20:25,575 --> 00:20:28,726
Speaker 0: and for my thing basically Remember water rockets.

294
00:20:28,766 --> 00:20:34,480
Speaker 0: when you were a kid you know you take a two-liter you fill it with some water you pump it up With an air pump, and then you let it fly into the air and you go

295
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,543
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm

296
00:20:36,563 --> 00:20:41,220
Speaker 0: imagine taking like 20 of them and strapping them to your back and letting them all go at the same time.

297
00:20:41,642 --> 00:20:43,289
Speaker 1: Is that enough to get you going?

298
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:48,639
Speaker 0: yes, yes, it is as Japanese television has shown us.

299
00:20:48,659 --> 00:20:50,809
Speaker 1: oh Those Japanese

300
00:20:50,909 --> 00:21:00,039
Speaker 0: I guess the most hilarious thing about this video is The guy they do this to does not at any point look either Amused or happy that this is happening to him

301
00:21:00,582 --> 00:21:04,080
Speaker 1: And he's also wearing one of those little yellow hats at the plus from the Megaman game.

302
00:21:04,160 --> 00:21:05,147
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know a little Megaman guys.

303
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:05,751
Speaker 0: They shoot at you.

304
00:21:06,053 --> 00:21:08,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah Like those helmets.

305
00:21:08,468 --> 00:21:09,272
Speaker 0: so it's hilarious.

306
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:16,239
Speaker 0: and all I have to say is that Try this at home, but don't say I told you to try it at home because I want to see other people attempt this.

307
00:21:17,144 --> 00:21:18,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, that'd be hilarious.

308
00:21:19,261 --> 00:21:22,833
Speaker 0: And if you're gonna attempt it attempt it over water like this guy did.

309
00:21:23,053 --> 00:21:25,080
Speaker 0: this guy would have died if that hadn't been water.

310
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:25,983
Speaker 0: That's all I gotta say.

311
00:21:26,003 --> 00:21:27,607
Speaker 1: oh my god.

312
00:21:27,627 --> 00:21:31,800
Speaker 1: It would have been you know a guy dying sad, but oh the hilarity.

313
00:21:32,181 --> 00:21:34,331
Speaker 0: Well now if you die in a funny way, it's schadenfreude.

314
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:40,174
Speaker 0: if I die in a hilarious way I expect to be on Fark with some sort of amusing tag.

315
00:21:40,415 --> 00:21:41,580
Speaker 1: What if you didn't know about Fark?

316
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:45,380
Speaker 0: Then I'd assume that at least my friends would laugh about how I died.

317
00:21:46,380 --> 00:22:00,717
Speaker 0: I mean I died in a funny way like say a Dildo fell out of a plane and was hit by a meteorite and then flew through the house and impaled me From the V from behind and killed me.

318
00:22:02,201 --> 00:22:04,147
Speaker 1: Wow that'd be kind of that's pretty creative.

319
00:22:04,168 --> 00:22:06,737
Speaker 0: yeah, I'm good on the fly like that.

320
00:22:06,998 --> 00:22:07,499
Speaker 1: yeah, I'm sure.

321
00:22:09,623 --> 00:22:15,320
Speaker 1: So today's video game day Not too many actual new video games or anything coming down.

322
00:22:15,521 --> 00:22:17,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's no video games, but we're not playing any of them.

323
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:20,614
Speaker 0: I mean ever there's probably a new spongebob game or whatever.

324
00:22:20,634 --> 00:22:27,440
Speaker 1: well actually there is a game I started playing the other day that hopefully will actually continue to play and we can eventually do a podcast with it.

325
00:22:27,701 --> 00:22:30,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I downloaded Civ 2 and started playing it again.

326
00:22:31,281 --> 00:22:34,640
Speaker 0: But I'd like to play it some more before I actually talk about it at length.

327
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:38,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I downloaded and played it once or twice cuz.

328
00:22:38,593 --> 00:22:45,500
Speaker 0: I you know for the longing, but You know there's mostly the nostalgia trip because I played the hell out of that game when I was in high school.

329
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:47,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much all I can get out of it now.

330
00:22:47,395 --> 00:22:55,739
Speaker 0: It's kind of sad Yeah, so we decided we're gonna go through a history of first-person shooters as they relate to the two of us.

331
00:22:56,201 --> 00:23:05,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, is you know we're not too big into the brand new ones although I did play a little Counter-Strike source the other day, but yeah, but I rebooted to Windows to check out I guess happening.

332
00:23:05,943 --> 00:23:06,886
Speaker 0: I just warn you ahead of time.

333
00:23:06,946 --> 00:23:13,405
Speaker 0: if we at all in this podcast sound pretentious or old-school Don't worry about it.

334
00:23:13,446 --> 00:23:16,240
Speaker 0: We're just we're old-school when it comes to first-person shooters.

335
00:23:16,581 --> 00:23:19,995
Speaker 1: Yeah, we sound pretentious cuz we are and sound like being an asshole.

336
00:23:20,015 --> 00:23:20,758
Speaker 1: It's cuz we are.

337
00:23:20,778 --> 00:23:25,092
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, and yeah, we are but it's kind of that we play like we really.

338
00:23:25,132 --> 00:23:35,510
Speaker 0: we were really into first-person shooters back in the day Not because they were inherently better just because that's the kind of first-person shooters that we played and The newer better like that.

339
00:23:35,832 --> 00:23:36,720
Speaker 1: so anyone suck.

340
00:23:37,031 --> 00:23:41,299
Speaker 0: Yeah So we don't play the new one so much and there are a lot of reasons for that that we'll try get into.

341
00:23:41,319 --> 00:23:42,363
Speaker 1: they're not As good as the old ones.

342
00:23:42,383 --> 00:23:49,215
Speaker 0: We're starting right at the beginning just being so yeah Wolfenstein.

343
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:52,609
Speaker 0: ah There were first-person shooters before Wolfenstein.

344
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:56,420
Speaker 0: there were quite a few which ones I've seen them.

345
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:57,724
Speaker 1: There wasn't anything.

346
00:23:57,765 --> 00:24:01,860
Speaker 1: Wolfenstein 3d as far as I know was the first first-person shooting game.

347
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:06,040
Speaker 1: That was you know that was that that mattered that it was the first one.

348
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:06,803
Speaker 0: It was the first.

349
00:24:06,823 --> 00:24:10,155
Speaker 1: the other ones like it was rise of the triad and there was another one.

350
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:13,606
Speaker 1: those came a little bit after You know there was.

351
00:24:13,646 --> 00:24:20,174
Speaker 1: there were first-person shooters between Wolfenstein 3d and doom But Wolfenstein 3d was the was the first one that I.

352
00:24:20,235 --> 00:24:24,371
Speaker 0: well there were three dimensional walk around from the first person that interact with thing.

353
00:24:24,432 --> 00:24:26,179
Speaker 1: there were but a lot of those were.

354
00:24:26,259 --> 00:24:30,820
Speaker 1: you know You would like push north and the guy would go north, and then you would push like turn left.

355
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,380
Speaker 0: And I guess my point was Wolfenstein 3d was the first.

356
00:24:33,641 --> 00:24:40,320
Speaker 0: Wolfenstein was the first game that it basically started the first-person genre to where it is now a genre.

357
00:24:40,641 --> 00:24:43,511
Speaker 0: Yep, it was the first one that mattered that anyone cares about.

358
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:46,200
Speaker 0: that might have existed, and it was pretty awesome.

359
00:24:46,725 --> 00:24:48,120
Speaker 1: It was actually really awesome.

360
00:24:48,401 --> 00:24:50,913
Speaker 0: I remember being blown away when I saw it for the first time.

361
00:24:51,294 --> 00:24:53,908
Speaker 1: first time I saw it was At this guy's.

362
00:24:53,928 --> 00:24:56,080
Speaker 1: I'm not even gonna talk about this guy cuz it's such a story.

363
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,140
Speaker 1: But he had a crap-doss computer, and it's playing Wolfenstein.

364
00:24:59,321 --> 00:25:00,585
Speaker 1: And I was like how do you play this?

365
00:25:00,666 --> 00:25:03,255
Speaker 1: and we were playing this game by pushing the mouth.

366
00:25:03,276 --> 00:25:04,058
Speaker 1: we were playing with mouse.

367
00:25:04,259 --> 00:25:12,659
Speaker 1: only Read you push the mouse forward to walk forward pick it up Put it at the back of the mouse pad push it forward again to move forward again.

368
00:25:13,322 --> 00:25:15,810
Speaker 1: You know one button shoots one buttons open doors.

369
00:25:16,532 --> 00:25:22,377
Speaker 0: I mean oh man if you've never played Wolfenstein I recommend you don't because it's it's really terrible game.

370
00:25:22,398 --> 00:25:26,647
Speaker 0: No It's not fun compared to modern games at all.

371
00:25:26,687 --> 00:25:26,888
Speaker 0: well.

372
00:25:27,048 --> 00:25:27,770
Speaker 0: It's tedious.

373
00:25:28,252 --> 00:25:32,648
Speaker 0: It's very difficult, but it's not difficult in a fun way I don't I disagree.

374
00:25:32,668 --> 00:25:34,879
Speaker 1: I mean Wolfenstein 3d is just.

375
00:25:35,863 --> 00:25:36,384
Speaker 1: It's not.

376
00:25:36,565 --> 00:25:43,580
Speaker 1: it's a first-person shooter in that you walk around you point it guys and you push the button to kill them But it's a different kind of first-person shooter.

377
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:52,700
Speaker 1: I mean the game was more of a maze game of get the keys to open the doors and Push-button against the wall to open the secrets and collect the treasure to get points.

378
00:25:53,141 --> 00:25:54,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know that kind of stuff.

379
00:25:54,466 --> 00:25:55,570
Speaker 1: the shooting was just.

380
00:25:55,630 --> 00:25:58,180
Speaker 1: you know it was like a maze of bad guys.

381
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:01,321
Speaker 0: You walk into a room, and there's five Nazis, and they're all shooting at you You should.

382
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:12,270
Speaker 1: yeah, it wasn't really the skill of you know reflex and aiming that is present in the you know modern real FPS's because you really couldn't have that when it was fate.

383
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:15,119
Speaker 1: You know the fake 3d that they had because it's really a 2d game.

384
00:26:15,481 --> 00:26:17,347
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean it's beyond 2d.

385
00:26:17,729 --> 00:26:20,017
Speaker 0: You can't have anything that wasn't a right angle in that game.

386
00:26:20,097 --> 00:26:23,474
Speaker 1: even yeah It was really just left and right and forward and back.

387
00:26:23,514 --> 00:26:24,499
Speaker 1: there was no up and down.

388
00:26:24,781 --> 00:26:33,779
Speaker 0: It's honestly while I was blown away by the graphics like when I saw it like wow it's 3d go I didn't know it was wasn't really 3d back then, but I didn't actually like the game so much.

389
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:34,803
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't.

390
00:26:34,883 --> 00:26:38,216
Speaker 1: I didn't really care about the graphics cuz I'd seen games with better graphics than that.

391
00:26:38,256 --> 00:26:42,927
Speaker 1: that I thought you know And I don't really pay attention to graphics anyway But I just really like.

392
00:26:43,047 --> 00:26:50,680
Speaker 1: you know the the finding secrets maze kind of game And I like shooting the Nazis and it was popular, but it wasn't crazy popular.

393
00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:51,822
Speaker 1: No It was.

394
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:56,479
Speaker 1: it was pretty big like the thing about Wolfenstein that actually like it.

395
00:26:56,761 --> 00:27:00,235
Speaker 1: It didn't sell as many as doom or other FPS's you know it's not.

396
00:27:00,255 --> 00:27:05,479
Speaker 1: it wasn't crazy numbers But it was weird because like my dad would have it on his work PC.

397
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,011
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like people I knew that like weren't?

398
00:27:09,051 --> 00:27:11,579
Speaker 1: gamers would have it like pirated for their DOS boxes.

399
00:27:11,599 --> 00:27:13,969
Speaker 1: there at least They would have the shareware version with one level.

400
00:27:13,989 --> 00:27:14,511
Speaker 1: Yep.

401
00:27:14,552 --> 00:27:16,440
Speaker 0: You didn't see that so much with any other FPS.

402
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:19,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know you don't see doom wasn't on.

403
00:27:19,976 --> 00:27:21,683
Speaker 1: you know people's work PCs that was.

404
00:27:21,844 --> 00:27:23,973
Speaker 1: that was when you know it was a thing the gamers did.

405
00:27:24,033 --> 00:27:27,504
Speaker 1: but when it was a DOS game Like that in those times.

406
00:27:28,206 --> 00:27:29,991
Speaker 1: You know it was businessmen that had.

407
00:27:30,011 --> 00:27:31,434
Speaker 1: you know PCs.

408
00:27:31,494 --> 00:27:33,219
Speaker 1: It wasn't really super PC gaming.

409
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:36,591
Speaker 1: yet Wolfenstein kind of started the PC gaming.

410
00:27:36,732 --> 00:27:38,820
Speaker 1: actually Wolfenstein and doom in between there.

411
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, so when Wolfenstein came out.

412
00:27:41,187 --> 00:27:45,100
Speaker 1: It was really the PCs were for you know business people.

413
00:27:45,160 --> 00:27:45,662
Speaker 1: So those.

414
00:27:46,044 --> 00:27:56,660
Speaker 0: that's where you saw a lot of Wolfenstein action, and then in 1993 the game that pretty much defined me as a PC gamer doom came out.

415
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:58,205
Speaker 1: Doom doom doom.

416
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:01,260
Speaker 0: that game was a revolution compared to Wolfenstein.

417
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:06,325
Speaker 1: Still you know not all the way there But it was the.

418
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:12,365
Speaker 1: it was less about the amazing and more about the shooting and it exploded Exploded huge.

419
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,480
Speaker 0: everyone had the shareware like everyone.

420
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:20,137
Speaker 0: I mean for those of you might be younger than us or older than us to the point where you this kind.

421
00:28:20,158 --> 00:28:20,981
Speaker 0: you skipped over This.

422
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:22,649
Speaker 0: everyone had this game.

423
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:25,019
Speaker 0: people bought new computers to play this game.

424
00:28:25,763 --> 00:28:32,029
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean these days you can find like a hundred people with ps2s And you can't find a single game they all have.

425
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,702
Speaker 1: I mean they don't even all have the stupid GTA game You know.

426
00:28:35,823 --> 00:28:39,095
Speaker 1: but L in those days you had a PC.

427
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:40,400
Speaker 1: it had doom on it.

428
00:28:40,641 --> 00:28:48,833
Speaker 0: I mean I had to hold down f5 when DOS booted and then manually load the minimum number of drivers I needed to make do work, or I couldn't play it.

429
00:28:48,853 --> 00:28:51,187
Speaker 1: I Had a better PC than that.

430
00:28:51,328 --> 00:28:53,240
Speaker 0: well, then I bought four megabytes of RAM, and I was all good.

431
00:28:53,621 --> 00:28:55,648
Speaker 0: Okay, but doom actually do.

432
00:28:56,049 --> 00:28:57,955
Speaker 0: there was a lot of hype before doom came out.

433
00:28:58,056 --> 00:28:59,340
Speaker 0: a lot of people were talking about it.

434
00:28:59,661 --> 00:29:12,806
Speaker 0: We were like this game is gonna be crazy and apparently the original version of doom before they actually released It was going to have a lot more features than doom actually had and they were taken out due to Developmental and processing power constraints.

435
00:29:13,549 --> 00:29:14,150
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know that.

436
00:29:14,411 --> 00:29:20,658
Speaker 0: yeah like the original demo of doom if you fired a gun It would deface the textures on the map.

437
00:29:21,702 --> 00:29:28,404
Speaker 0: So there would be bullet holes and they were supposed to be shadows and all this stuff that they took out because there's no way It could be done back then.

438
00:29:28,424 --> 00:29:34,159
Speaker 0: uh-huh, and this is kind of cool, but Yeah, they will one the BFG.

439
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:35,924
Speaker 0: this is the first game.

440
00:29:36,004 --> 00:29:51,199
Speaker 0: the BFG aka the big fucking gun yeah appeared in and Many of you who played doom remember the BFG was kind of weird Like it didn't really work the way you expected it to and I can explain in great detail How it actually works, but you probably don't care.

441
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:56,020
Speaker 1: yeah I expected it just kill all the guys in the room because it was a giant green blob and then it exploded.

442
00:29:56,425 --> 00:29:57,600
Speaker 1: But that's not what it did at all.

443
00:29:57,680 --> 00:29:57,801
Speaker 1: But

444
00:29:58,182 --> 00:30:05,514
Speaker 0: well originally and you can find the demo of the original doom before it was actually released if you look hard enough I don't have it, but it's easy

445
00:30:05,555 --> 00:30:05,878
Speaker 1: to get and

446
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:14,100
Speaker 0: The original BFG actually fired out various colored fireballs in like a 45 degree angle and just filled the room with death.

447
00:30:15,322 --> 00:30:19,239
Speaker 0: But that was too many sprites and most computers couldn't handle it and the game engine could barely handle it.

448
00:30:20,163 --> 00:30:27,510
Speaker 0: So they nerfed it and they made this really weird system where you fire the BFG Whatever direction you were facing when you fired.

449
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:30,400
Speaker 0: it is the direction from which the damage will emanate.

450
00:30:31,882 --> 00:30:38,320
Speaker 0: And then so if you fire say you fire it into a room Like there's a long room and then you turn and you run into another room.

451
00:30:39,101 --> 00:30:42,350
Speaker 0: Then in the original room the BFG ball finally hits the wall.

452
00:30:42,671 --> 00:30:44,597
Speaker 0: when it hits the wall that triggers the damage.

453
00:30:44,898 --> 00:30:50,814
Speaker 0: and then the damage Will emanate from your character in the direction you were facing when you fired it into this new room and won't do anything in the old room.

454
00:30:52,262 --> 00:30:56,900
Speaker 1: See that's the kind of stuff you lose of the modern FPS is nowadays you push the button a bullet comes out.

455
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:58,848
Speaker 1: Whatever the bullet hits is what happens.

456
00:30:58,968 --> 00:31:12,199
Speaker 1: Yep, you know this kind of cool stuff while Granted it doesn't make for the most Immersive perfect awesome gaming, you know world type things and stuff, but it's kind of this.

457
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:24,079
Speaker 0: You know comfortable brokenness of Cool quirkiness that you kind of miss sometimes Like in the old NES games when you could glitch the game and go into like areas that you weren't supposed to get into.

458
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:31,538
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like this, you know fun good brokenness in games that is really missing today.

459
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:35,860
Speaker 1: and You know if I was a super game designer, I would totally put stuff into my games on purpose.

460
00:31:36,262 --> 00:31:40,157
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least it made it all the way to counter-strike, but we'll get to that now.

461
00:31:40,277 --> 00:31:49,297
Speaker 0: in addition to doom Just looking better and being a better game It had two key additions that these are what really revolutionized FPS gaming the shotgun and the plasma cannon.

462
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:54,066
Speaker 0: I Wasn't gonna say that damn Though the plasma cannon was my gun.

463
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:55,931
Speaker 1: plasma cannon was also my good.

464
00:31:56,132 --> 00:31:58,017
Speaker 1: hold that thing down blue balls coming out.

465
00:31:58,097 --> 00:31:58,318
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

466
00:31:58,378 --> 00:32:01,603
Speaker 0: All right, so one network Multiplayer.

467
00:32:01,984 --> 00:32:08,848
Speaker 0: well sort of well, basically if you if you were a businessman or if you had money You might have had a computer network.

468
00:32:09,230 --> 00:32:12,708
Speaker 0: I mean most people didn't have network cards Networking Ethernet.

469
00:32:12,768 --> 00:32:13,998
Speaker 0: most people didn't know what Ethernet was.

470
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:17,072
Speaker 0: You probably had dial-up or in the very least you had a modem.

471
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:20,023
Speaker 0: a lot of people back then had modems But not dial-up.

472
00:32:20,284 --> 00:32:22,490
Speaker 0: They would dial into things and do things.

473
00:32:22,791 --> 00:32:23,994
Speaker 0: Yep, BBS days.

474
00:32:24,135 --> 00:32:24,676
Speaker 1: That was fun.

475
00:32:25,378 --> 00:32:29,840
Speaker 0: and doom You could start a server where your computer would listen on the modem.

476
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:34,519
Speaker 0: Your friend would then call you and you could play directly over your modem connection.

477
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:40,391
Speaker 0: I did this for hours upon hours Back in the day with a couple of my friends.

478
00:32:40,954 --> 00:32:51,308
Speaker 1: We did it a few times But not hours upon hours upon hours, and we actually did it more later with heretic actually Because that game was like had the items.

479
00:32:51,549 --> 00:32:56,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then we did it again with command and conquer alert Which works scarily well.

480
00:32:56,702 --> 00:33:04,046
Speaker 0: It also had and I never got to play it back then if you had an IPX network not IP IPX like Novell network.

481
00:33:04,187 --> 00:33:05,873
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't know what it is, don't worry about it.

482
00:33:06,335 --> 00:33:07,399
Speaker 0: No one uses it anymore.

483
00:33:07,419 --> 00:33:11,919
Speaker 0: and Basically, you could play four player deathmatch.

484
00:33:12,761 --> 00:33:16,780
Speaker 0: That was like the holy grail of gaming to me and I spent much of my youth trying to do it.

485
00:33:18,026 --> 00:33:18,759
Speaker 0: Is there were crazy?

486
00:33:18,940 --> 00:33:25,205
Speaker 0: Softwares where you could like dial into one person and that person had two modems and then they dialed into someone else and three Of you could play.

487
00:33:25,426 --> 00:33:26,694
Speaker 0: we never got any of that stuff to work.

488
00:33:27,056 --> 00:33:32,440
Speaker 1: Nope but yeah, I mean You know nowadays you kind of take deathmatch for granted.

489
00:33:32,881 --> 00:33:38,795
Speaker 1: Imagine if like deathmatch was this ultra mode and only the most elite people could actually play multiplayer.

490
00:33:39,016 --> 00:33:39,918
Speaker 1: It was like whoa.

491
00:33:39,938 --> 00:33:48,314
Speaker 1: Yeah So while the deathmatch looking back on it really wasn't so great I mean you just kind of walked around with a bunch of broken weapons.

492
00:33:48,595 --> 00:33:49,459
Speaker 1: Yeah at each other.

493
00:33:50,264 --> 00:33:54,346
Speaker 1: It was something that you just never been done Couldn't be done and free.

494
00:33:54,486 --> 00:33:56,634
Speaker 1: it would be years and years before it was easy to do.

495
00:33:56,654 --> 00:34:00,306
Speaker 0: and if any of you ever want Play a doom deathmatch with me.

496
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:05,460
Speaker 0: I am not kidding when I say I'm the almighty lord and god of doom deathmatch.

497
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:07,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you know so many other people have played it.

498
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:10,579
Speaker 0: I played a lot when I was in high school in middle school.

499
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:15,338
Speaker 1: I think you played it a lot more than like pretty much anyone outside of ID software just because people couldn't.

500
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:23,447
Speaker 0: Yeah, well because I got lucky like I grew up and like we got cable modems real early just because they happen to roll them Out as a test in my neighborhood.

501
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:25,500
Speaker 0: We got a cable on a real early.

502
00:34:25,761 --> 00:34:30,800
Speaker 1: I didn't even know that doom could be played multiplayer for a long time because it was hidden in the setup menu.

503
00:34:30,840 --> 00:34:31,627
Speaker 1: It wasn't in the real.

504
00:34:31,728 --> 00:34:33,059
Speaker 1: it wasn't an option in the game.

505
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:39,108
Speaker 0: I remember I found it and I tried to use it and my modem originally was 2400 baud which wasn't it not enough.

506
00:34:39,149 --> 00:34:39,530
Speaker 1: I had a 14-4 motor.

507
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:40,192
Speaker 1: So I bought a 33 6 modem.

508
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:43,563
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll do it.

509
00:34:44,106 --> 00:34:47,920
Speaker 1: Yeah at a 14-4 that I could do it with but it still wasn't very good.

510
00:34:48,301 --> 00:34:50,610
Speaker 0: And this is before 56 K which was digital.

511
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:57,311
Speaker 0: This was analog all the way All right, so and the other that was the first thing.

512
00:34:58,093 --> 00:34:59,578
Speaker 0: the other main thing that came about.

513
00:34:59,618 --> 00:35:04,335
Speaker 0: this is more in 1994 when doom 2 came out which is just more of the same the double-barreled shotgun.

514
00:35:04,516 --> 00:35:04,737
Speaker 0: Yep.

515
00:35:05,218 --> 00:35:08,219
Speaker 0: Nah Well, the double-barreled shotgun was there but it's modding.

516
00:35:08,761 --> 00:35:10,768
Speaker 1: I was saying double-barreled shotgun was the important thing.

517
00:35:10,949 --> 00:35:14,140
Speaker 0: people didn't really think to mod Wolfenstein when it came out.

518
00:35:14,521 --> 00:35:19,460
Speaker 1: You really couldn't doom - oh, no, we actually know there were mods for Wolfenstein.

519
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:23,580
Speaker 1: I remember there was like a Barney mod where you could shoot Barney cuz you hated him so much.

520
00:35:23,821 --> 00:35:24,565
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz he was.

521
00:35:24,585 --> 00:35:25,651
Speaker 1: that was the thing at the time.

522
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:26,114
Speaker 1: was there like?

523
00:35:26,134 --> 00:35:26,496
Speaker 0: there was a?

524
00:35:26,556 --> 00:35:27,260
Speaker 1: not like Barney.

525
00:35:27,521 --> 00:35:28,805
Speaker 0: It wasn't like many people did it.

526
00:35:28,825 --> 00:35:30,691
Speaker 0: There was no real community around it.

527
00:35:30,972 --> 00:35:36,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, once doom 2 came out and Utilities started appearing like D hex and wadded.

528
00:35:36,896 --> 00:35:37,800
Speaker 0: Those are the two I use.

529
00:35:37,981 --> 00:35:38,402
Speaker 0: I heard those.

530
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:41,454
Speaker 1: one you could buy in the store to like modify doom.

531
00:35:41,495 --> 00:35:42,800
Speaker 1: There was a program you could buy.

532
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,772
Speaker 1: It was like it was like D or that exclamation point or something like that.

533
00:35:45,792 --> 00:35:49,305
Speaker 0: There was do there was win do There wadded was what I use.

534
00:35:49,325 --> 00:35:51,672
Speaker 0: the water was kind of buggy and there was D hex.

535
00:35:51,733 --> 00:36:02,559
Speaker 0: D hex actually edited the executable itself and this whole community of modding appeared and people made capture the flag type games and total conversions.

536
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:08,040
Speaker 0: and Whenever you play counter-strike or any game like that today, you know mega TF team fortress.

537
00:36:08,682 --> 00:36:13,180
Speaker 0: Think back and remember just for a second that doom 2 is where that all began.

538
00:36:14,061 --> 00:36:29,795
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean if some guy hadn't decided that he wanted to add a weapon to doom 2 and that he found out that well He could do that if he wanted and he took the time to figure out this crazy cryptic Undocumented crap and maybe even bought a program or two to get it to work.

539
00:36:30,477 --> 00:36:34,228
Speaker 1: He hadn't done that The only game we wouldn't have any of those mods.

540
00:36:34,268 --> 00:36:44,374
Speaker 1: The only games would be playing would be half-life 1 half-life 2 Half-life deathmatch, yeah There would be no capture the flag games.

541
00:36:44,716 --> 00:36:48,488
Speaker 1: there would be no Plant the bomb rescue the hostage games.

542
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:49,912
Speaker 1: There would be none of that.

543
00:36:50,293 --> 00:36:51,837
Speaker 1: There wouldn't be any team fortresses.

544
00:36:51,998 --> 00:36:52,800
Speaker 1: No two forts.

545
00:36:53,541 --> 00:36:54,123
Speaker 1: No, nothing.

546
00:36:54,725 --> 00:36:58,680
Speaker 0: Plus I got to admit it was easier back then just because there wasn't so much to the game.

547
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:05,314
Speaker 0: I still remember to this day all everything it takes to mod doom the line like the line deaths and the side deaths.

548
00:37:05,334 --> 00:37:12,337
Speaker 0: you have to define the sectors and then compile The sector maps and and the the error maps and all the stuff that makes a doom level.

549
00:37:12,357 --> 00:37:15,828
Speaker 0: and I made Flamethrowers and the funniest thing ever made.

550
00:37:15,849 --> 00:37:18,400
Speaker 0: I made a clone gun and it shot.

551
00:37:18,541 --> 00:37:25,380
Speaker 0: Well, I made it with a friend of mine and it shot a clone of you that would sit there And if it saw anything it would shoot it with plasma gun the zoom guy.

552
00:37:26,281 --> 00:37:29,075
Speaker 0: However, we were dumb and we made it.

553
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:37,299
Speaker 0: So basically it was this almighty god machine of death And if you fired one it just killed everyone and that was the end of the deathmatch.

554
00:37:37,881 --> 00:37:43,760
Speaker 1: Now was the clone that came out of the clone gun capable of you know playing doom like fully?

555
00:37:44,423 --> 00:37:45,989
Speaker 0: No, it would stand wherever it hit.

556
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:48,660
Speaker 1: Okay, so you couldn't walk around to pick up items or anything.

557
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:55,860
Speaker 0: Well, actually it was really difficult to make Complicated things because there was a certain number of frames of animation total in all of doom.

558
00:37:56,824 --> 00:38:02,119
Speaker 0: there was a list of them and Some of those frames Happened to have actions associated with them.

559
00:38:02,702 --> 00:38:10,099
Speaker 0: You could not associate an action with a frame that did not already have an action associated with it But you could change the action associated with a frame that had an action pointer.

560
00:38:10,481 --> 00:38:14,110
Speaker 0: Hmm, so there was a limited number of active things you could do.

561
00:38:14,532 --> 00:38:19,538
Speaker 0: so I made a flamethrower once but I had to destroy the Revenant so you couldn't have a revenant monster.

562
00:38:21,326 --> 00:38:23,100
Speaker 0: It was real complicated and real fun.

563
00:38:24,401 --> 00:38:29,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was gonna say maybe if the clone guy could get the clone gun and make a clone that would kill him.

564
00:38:29,661 --> 00:38:32,069
Speaker 0: Whoa that you know, well, my friend Ken made something funny.

565
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:39,473
Speaker 0: He made a rocket that when it explodes it spawned three rockets great and It crashed the game pretty handily if you ever fired it.

566
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:40,860
Speaker 1: I can imagine.

567
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:44,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wonder if that would actually work in a more powerful computer though.

568
00:38:44,442 --> 00:38:45,708
Speaker 0: No, because the game maxes out.

569
00:38:45,748 --> 00:38:49,245
Speaker 0: there were a lot of hard coded limits in doom Mmm, like.

570
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:49,807
Speaker 0: I forget that.

571
00:38:50,048 --> 00:39:00,513
Speaker 0: I forget the number of sectors, but there's a limited number of sectors and if you take the scale of the guy maps couldn't be bigger than a Like nine football fields at the absolute maximum.

572
00:39:00,653 --> 00:39:01,376
Speaker 0: It's pretty big though.

573
00:39:01,657 --> 00:39:06,193
Speaker 1: It is pretty big All right, so doom - and then yep.

574
00:39:06,494 --> 00:39:07,980
Speaker 0: now see the next thing.

575
00:39:08,581 --> 00:39:15,779
Speaker 0: It's a revolution in terms of what games were and how FPS is works, but it honestly personally I didn't like it at all.

576
00:39:16,642 --> 00:39:19,955
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't like it because my computer couldn't really do it so much.

577
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:21,240
Speaker 0: my computer could do it.

578
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:25,160
Speaker 0: I just it wasn't a fun game at first because the single-player was kind of blah.

579
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,588
Speaker 0: But doom was not three-dimensional.

580
00:39:28,809 --> 00:39:30,434
Speaker 0: It was 2.5 dimensional.

581
00:39:30,454 --> 00:39:31,137
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

582
00:39:31,719 --> 00:39:34,845
Speaker 1: Wake one And first Nukem 3d.

583
00:39:34,945 --> 00:39:42,389
Speaker 0: and yes and Duke Nukem 3d which came out shortly after that everyone forgets were the first Three-dimensional first-person shooters.

584
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:43,532
Speaker 0: quake one was the first one.

585
00:39:43,813 --> 00:39:45,860
Speaker 1: I mean, this is where the mouse look was invented.

586
00:39:46,041 --> 00:39:49,260
Speaker 1: I mean because I kind of skipped this part for a little while.

587
00:39:49,421 --> 00:39:52,680
Speaker 1: I mean I didn't because I didn't have a great computer for a little couple more years.

588
00:39:53,162 --> 00:40:01,175
Speaker 1: I didn't get quake one and Duke Nukem 3d right away, you know Like I got my computer when they had been out for you know, some months and such.

589
00:40:01,696 --> 00:40:03,724
Speaker 1: so, you know I didn't.

590
00:40:04,126 --> 00:40:10,774
Speaker 1: when I started getting the real 3d FPS is I Didn't really realize it right away because I didn't learn along with everyone else.

591
00:40:10,834 --> 00:40:13,648
Speaker 1: Like I learned doom and Wolfenstein and everything.

592
00:40:13,668 --> 00:40:15,559
Speaker 1: Yep, so I didn't even know to use mouse.

593
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:21,020
Speaker 1: look I was trying to control the games just the keyboard and look only left and right and I wasn't using like the straight.

594
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:26,360
Speaker 0: But I I was totally messed up and also keep in mind that this was before open GL.

595
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,105
Speaker 0: In fact GL.

596
00:40:29,185 --> 00:40:34,440
Speaker 0: quake came out after quake came out and it was a way to modify quake to use open GL.

597
00:40:34,681 --> 00:40:40,360
Speaker 1: If you happen to have an open GL card Yeah, cuz there was glide in those days, which is the voodoo thing.

598
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:48,908
Speaker 1: It was glide direct 3d and open GL and everyone either used glide if they had a voodoo card or open GL Otherwise and back when it first came out.

599
00:40:49,529 --> 00:40:51,275
Speaker 0: No one had an open GL card right away.

600
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:52,598
Speaker 0: They were expensive as hell.

601
00:40:52,799 --> 00:40:56,069
Speaker 1: Yep Open GL was like, oh my god, you have a real video card.

602
00:40:56,089 --> 00:40:56,611
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

603
00:40:56,952 --> 00:41:04,660
Speaker 0: I remember a friend of mine got a matrox mystique Yeah, and I had a creative graphics blaster extreme with two X's and an extra e.

604
00:41:04,941 --> 00:41:09,060
Speaker 1: I didn't have a card that could do it until I got my TNT too, which is way late way late.

605
00:41:10,261 --> 00:41:11,748
Speaker 0: And there's not much I can really say about quake.

606
00:41:11,868 --> 00:41:14,660
Speaker 0: one other than that it it was a technological improvement.

607
00:41:14,841 --> 00:41:25,678
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean quake one pretty much took out most of the amazing it took out, you know, I guess there's some key door action Yeah, but most of it was just run around and shoot guys and don't get shot and it's 3d.

608
00:41:26,060 --> 00:41:27,107
Speaker 1: You have to look up and down.

609
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:27,973
Speaker 1: It's not automatic.

610
00:41:28,033 --> 00:41:31,947
Speaker 0: Oh most importantly Multiplayer was now on the internet with IP.

611
00:41:32,409 --> 00:41:35,940
Speaker 0: Yep, and type in an IP address connect to a server and fight with people.

612
00:41:36,021 --> 00:41:39,289
Speaker 1: There was no automatic game matching so you still had to find a game.

613
00:41:39,571 --> 00:41:45,639
Speaker 1: but there were things that you could get like Kali and M player and all kinds of services that would match you up with people, you know.

614
00:41:45,941 --> 00:41:49,340
Speaker 0: Now the thing is I mean even when quake 2 came out there was still no automatic.

615
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:58,159
Speaker 0: It wasn't until steam that you're both one life one and one that you really had the match me up with games and play Yep, and even then it was crappy.

616
00:41:58,622 --> 00:42:00,149
Speaker 0: I mean back in the quake one quake two days.

617
00:42:00,169 --> 00:42:04,320
Speaker 0: you had to go to the CLQ the Champions League for quake Which was actually this cool site.

618
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:10,627
Speaker 0: It's gone now and I wish I had an archive of it because I have a lot of shirts at archive that org or something or way back.

619
00:42:10,647 --> 00:42:18,840
Speaker 0: machine quake servers put out a lot of data and They set up this site where you it would if you use the same name all the time when you play it.

620
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:31,953
Speaker 0: It would just collect stats on you and there was a long period of time where I was me and my two friends of mine were in the top 10 for weapons factory in quake 2 Mmm, I just thought I'd throw that in a little gloating moment.

621
00:42:31,993 --> 00:42:32,818
Speaker 0: I was very proud of that.

622
00:42:33,422 --> 00:42:36,880
Speaker 1: Your weapons factory was a crazy mod with crazy weapons for quake 2.

623
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz quake 1 mega TF and capture the flag.

624
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:41,737
Speaker 0: That is when those first really appeared.

625
00:42:41,757 --> 00:42:49,718
Speaker 0: Yep, and You realize to this day There are hardcore people who still play a mega TF and consider it the pinnacle of first-person shooting.

626
00:42:49,738 --> 00:42:50,810
Speaker 1: not many people But a few.

627
00:42:50,830 --> 00:42:52,686
Speaker 0: yes It's a very close-knit community.

628
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:55,598
Speaker 0: that with which actually we have a friend named Dan who?

629
00:42:56,982 --> 00:43:00,460
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure is probably the best mega TF player in the world.

630
00:43:01,062 --> 00:43:10,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you weren't paying attention TF is Team Fortress, which is the original, you know Two forts capture the flag pick a class go at it, you know game.

631
00:43:11,041 --> 00:43:14,921
Speaker 1: Yeah, all the predicate TF is the mega version for quake 1.

632
00:43:14,921 --> 00:43:21,338
Speaker 0: Yep, and all the capture the flag type games nowadays have their roots in team fortress and mega team fortress.

633
00:43:21,618 --> 00:43:30,747
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Team Fortress classic for half-life was actually a port of the original Team Fortress From quake 1 to the half-life engine.

634
00:43:31,308 --> 00:43:40,859
Speaker 1: that because valve purchased the guys who made the original Team Fortress and We're still waiting for Team Fortress 2 which was supposed to be out a hundred years ago.

635
00:43:41,061 --> 00:43:43,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, not so long as Duke Nukem forever.

636
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:53,996
Speaker 1: Yeah Duke Nukem forever was supposed to like if I remember correctly was supposed to compete with quake 2 because Duke Duke him 3d Competed with quake 1 and actually Duke Nukem 3d was a real good game.

637
00:43:54,137 --> 00:43:54,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had it.

638
00:43:56,141 --> 00:44:03,000
Speaker 1: The reason Duke Nukem 3d didn't stick around the way quake did is because didn't really have the big multiplayer action.

639
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,699
Speaker 0: It was well it did into in fact that it was all in the game and you could do it.

640
00:44:07,941 --> 00:44:08,911
Speaker 0: yeah, but no one did it.

641
00:44:09,133 --> 00:44:18,340
Speaker 1: yeah and Duke Nukem 3d was really a first player one player experience In fact, I think it's actually better than the quake one one player by a lot.

642
00:44:18,481 --> 00:44:29,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a lot of funny stuff and there were a lot of you know Things going on and silly weapons and and actually I played a lot of the multiplayer and all I have to say is the game Came with bots.

643
00:44:29,664 --> 00:44:33,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it was the first multiplayer first-person shooter to come with bots.

644
00:44:33,115 --> 00:44:33,797
Speaker 0: You could play with.

645
00:44:33,817 --> 00:44:36,727
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Those bots fucking killed me.

646
00:44:37,510 --> 00:44:38,333
Speaker 0: I couldn't even move.

647
00:44:38,574 --> 00:44:40,200
Speaker 0: I'd spawned to kill me at spawn they kill me.

648
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:44,256
Speaker 0: Yep, those bots if you ever play if you ever find this game play against the bots.

649
00:44:44,417 --> 00:44:44,598
Speaker 0: Yeah.

650
00:44:44,618 --> 00:44:45,080
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

651
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,402
Speaker 1: So people actually, you know like Duke Nukem 3d and when quake 2 was gonna come out people like hey Where's the next?

652
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,652
Speaker 1: where's the Duke Nukem 3d that's supposed to compete with it?

653
00:44:52,712 --> 00:44:53,495
Speaker 1: and it didn't come.

654
00:44:53,736 --> 00:44:54,600
Speaker 0: they said it was coming.

655
00:44:54,801 --> 00:44:59,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, that it was coming for all these years and that's what Duke Nukem forever is all about.

656
00:44:59,699 --> 00:45:05,440
Speaker 1: is That's the game that never came out and supposedly they're still working on and we're still waiting for it.

657
00:45:05,540 --> 00:45:06,588
Speaker 0: This quake came out in 1994.

658
00:45:06,588 --> 00:45:12,728
Speaker 0: It's now 2006 almost Yeah 12 years.

659
00:45:13,131 --> 00:45:14,298
Speaker 0: Yeah, great.

660
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:17,068
Speaker 0: and 1990 or 1996.

661
00:45:17,068 --> 00:45:18,575
Speaker 0: Sorry, I can't read my own handwriting.

662
00:45:18,655 --> 00:45:19,017
Speaker 1: Okay.

663
00:45:19,398 --> 00:45:27,442
Speaker 0: Yeah Doom was 1993 doom 2 was 94 quake was 96 quake 2 was 97.

664
00:45:27,442 --> 00:45:32,216
Speaker 1: All right, so we've been waiting almost 10 years if not 10 years for this game, and it's still not out yet.

665
00:45:32,397 --> 00:45:36,942
Speaker 1: Yep Games usually take two to three years to make not 10.

666
00:45:36,942 --> 00:45:48,220
Speaker 0: But quake 2 which came out after quake 1 is considered by many people not definitely not most people but a large number of people Not just us to be the golden age of first-person shooters.

667
00:45:48,441 --> 00:45:56,068
Speaker 1: I wouldn't say it's the golden age of first-person shooters, but I would say that quake 2 was pretty much like the first Complete FPS.

668
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:58,520
Speaker 1: I mean quake 1 had some problems.

669
00:45:58,821 --> 00:46:00,326
Speaker 1: Everyone knows quake 1 had some problems.

670
00:46:00,406 --> 00:46:03,557
Speaker 1: quake 2 pretty much solved all the problems and it was.

671
00:46:03,677 --> 00:46:04,520
Speaker 1: it was just an FPS.

672
00:46:05,142 --> 00:46:09,257
Speaker 0: It was it was modded to an extent that I don't think any game has been modded since.

673
00:46:09,739 --> 00:46:13,373
Speaker 1: yeah At least with playable in terms of quantity of playable.

674
00:46:13,534 --> 00:46:15,401
Speaker 1: maybe half-life might beat it out But it's.

675
00:46:15,622 --> 00:46:20,480
Speaker 0: I think half-life beats it out in some quality nowadays, but there were thousands of mods.

676
00:46:21,082 --> 00:46:22,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's thousands of half-life mods.

677
00:46:22,870 --> 00:46:25,200
Speaker 1: It's just it's just so hard to get them and stuff.

678
00:46:25,220 --> 00:46:25,642
Speaker 1: I don't know.

679
00:46:25,662 --> 00:46:36,505
Speaker 1: But anyway quake 2 had crazy modding and had crazy everything and every first-person shooter since really hasn't Added that much.

680
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:39,920
Speaker 1: since quake 2 it mostly graphics have been added and stuff.

681
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:44,420
Speaker 0: But because other than that I played I mean, you know counter-strike you like counter-strike.

682
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:53,372
Speaker 0: The first game like that that was popular was action quake, which was a mod for quake 2 which actually was fantastic and I loved it to no end.

683
00:46:53,573 --> 00:47:02,740
Speaker 1: action quake was very good that if you if you Don't have quake or it's too hard for you to get action quake working You can get action half-life actually and you could run that on Steam.

684
00:47:03,081 --> 00:47:04,024
Speaker 1: You know what's going on?

685
00:47:04,345 --> 00:47:14,066
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is like we played weapons factory and action quake 2 and all that and lithium deathmatch incessantly and Quake 3 was on the horizon.

686
00:47:14,488 --> 00:47:18,058
Speaker 0: We couldn't wait like we thought it's gonna be a thousand times better.

687
00:47:18,078 --> 00:47:19,063
Speaker 0: This is oh my god Oh my god.

688
00:47:19,083 --> 00:47:22,925
Speaker 0: Oh my god, like the hype was unimaginable definitely out of control.

689
00:47:22,985 --> 00:47:46,243
Speaker 0: and then quake 3 came out and I bought it and I put it in my computer and I played it and I was really unimpressed with the single-player, but I thought all right they'll make the mods and sure enough shortly thereafter the weapons factory mod came out and an action quake like mod came out and the weapons factor was done by the same people and It was just.

690
00:47:46,685 --> 00:47:47,348
Speaker 0: it wasn't the same.

691
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:48,111
Speaker 0: It was piss-poor.

692
00:47:48,192 --> 00:47:49,960
Speaker 0: It was just a worse game with better graphics.

693
00:47:50,382 --> 00:47:53,400
Speaker 1: Yep, quake 3. what they did is they concentrated a whole lot on the graphics.

694
00:47:54,082 --> 00:48:03,873
Speaker 1: They pretty much threw out the single-player game the single-player and quake 3 was pretty much play multiplayer with bots Different difficulty levels and to make it actually difficult.

695
00:48:03,934 --> 00:48:05,159
Speaker 0: They made the bots cheat at the end.

696
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:09,712
Speaker 1: Yep like really they just cheated if you like the really hard difficulties in the.

697
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:19,092
Speaker 1: in the single-player quake 3 the bots would just you know They have more ammo than they were supposed to have or they would do things that people couldn't do and they go fast and they'd Auto aim and god knows what.

698
00:48:19,334 --> 00:48:19,919
Speaker 1: it was just dumb.

699
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:26,775
Speaker 1: But the multiplayer in quake 3 was you know It was just so generic and bland.

700
00:48:26,795 --> 00:48:27,900
Speaker 1: It wasn't it was slower.

701
00:48:28,201 --> 00:48:32,681
Speaker 0: I think a lot of you guys like just the movie like if you've ever played like quake 3.

702
00:48:32,681 --> 00:48:34,305
Speaker 0: It's very slow compared to quake 2.

703
00:48:34,305 --> 00:48:39,340
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and quake 2 is about three times slower than the quake 1 mods.

704
00:48:39,701 --> 00:48:46,331
Speaker 0: Mega TF is so fast that if you tried to play it and you're not used to those old-school games Literally, it'd just be a blur of the screen.

705
00:48:46,352 --> 00:48:47,057
Speaker 0: You wouldn't know what's going on.

706
00:48:47,097 --> 00:48:47,480
Speaker 0: Then you die.

707
00:48:47,741 --> 00:48:53,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do think part of the reason well part of the reason quake 1 was so fast is probably because it was so broken.

708
00:48:53,661 --> 00:48:55,312
Speaker 1: it wasn't intended to be so crazy fast.

709
00:48:55,332 --> 00:49:00,739
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and The reason quake 3 was slower I think is because it made it more accessible.

710
00:49:00,759 --> 00:49:04,459
Speaker 1: like You know quake 1 and quake 2 were sort of this.

711
00:49:05,481 --> 00:49:10,522
Speaker 1: You know only super crazy people could play it because really no one had a computer to play it other than crazy gamers Yep.

712
00:49:10,743 --> 00:49:13,300
Speaker 0: Well also they were trying to make it look more realistic.

713
00:49:13,601 --> 00:49:18,699
Speaker 0: Yeah, like in quake 3 when someone's feet move they lined up with the ground properly things like that.

714
00:49:19,281 --> 00:49:27,529
Speaker 0: But that I mean if you move the game at quake 2 speeds that would look silly Mm-hmm, so they sacrificed gameplay for graphics basically.

715
00:49:27,590 --> 00:49:30,837
Speaker 1: Well, we're not sure that was the trade-off they made but they did do stuff like that.

716
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:35,759
Speaker 1: and The thing about quake 3 was at that time is when you know.

717
00:49:35,981 --> 00:49:42,755
Speaker 1: That's when you know There were g-forces and stuff and you know Everyone had a computer that could kind of play quake 3 at some degree.

718
00:49:42,815 --> 00:49:45,538
Speaker 1: and they really want I think they really wanted to.

719
00:49:46,081 --> 00:49:53,725
Speaker 1: You know sell this game the way Wolfenstein was where everyone had Wolfenstein or had you know played it or doom where everyone had doom You know.

720
00:49:53,825 --> 00:49:56,318
Speaker 1: and so they're like quake 1 and quake 2 didn't quite do it.

721
00:49:56,941 --> 00:49:57,824
Speaker 1: It's quake 2 wasn't?

722
00:49:58,024 --> 00:50:05,031
Speaker 1: it was like really slow to build quake 1 like it started out like with anticipation But then it didn't explode.

723
00:50:05,091 --> 00:50:06,818
Speaker 1: it kind of was like here's quick one All right.

724
00:50:07,402 --> 00:50:10,913
Speaker 1: And then it kind of like quake 1 quake 1 quake 1 quake 1 quake 1.

725
00:50:10,913 --> 00:50:13,662
Speaker 0: quake 2 was just like this steady stream of Awesome.

726
00:50:13,702 --> 00:50:13,983
Speaker 0: Awesome.

727
00:50:14,023 --> 00:50:14,183
Speaker 0: Awesome.

728
00:50:14,264 --> 00:50:15,348
Speaker 0: I just a steady stream.

729
00:50:15,408 --> 00:50:16,271
Speaker 0: It never exploded.

730
00:50:16,331 --> 00:50:18,860
Speaker 0: It just stated an exploded state for the entirety of its run.

731
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:23,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, they wanted quake 3 to explode and I think the problem was they set the fuse wrong and it fizzled.

732
00:50:24,281 --> 00:50:35,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, because honestly more people probably play quake 2 and its mods today than play quake 3 and its mods Mm-hmm, because they're it's kind of scary but every mod that was popular for all these old games.

733
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:46,068
Speaker 0: There is a hardcore group of individuals on the internet who play it regularly Mm-hmm, and sadly that's really where we stopped playing first-person shooters.

734
00:50:46,268 --> 00:50:50,003
Speaker 1: Well, no because we played a lot of counter-strike Before the quake 3 era.

735
00:50:50,487 --> 00:50:50,849
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

736
00:50:51,271 --> 00:51:02,010
Speaker 1: Well half-life really was the the penultimate first like single-player Because it was the one the first game that like the story and the action were intertwined together into one thing.

737
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:03,214
Speaker 0: I mean, what was doom story?

738
00:51:03,254 --> 00:51:04,799
Speaker 0: You're a marine you're in hell.

739
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:05,862
Speaker 0: go for it.

740
00:51:06,504 --> 00:51:11,016
Speaker 1: Yeah, half-life had a story and It wasn't so much a maze.

741
00:51:11,056 --> 00:51:15,170
Speaker 1: It was actually pretty linear, but it was this like sort of task completion.

742
00:51:15,772 --> 00:51:17,578
Speaker 1: You know, how do I get over there?

743
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:31,350
Speaker 1: crawling through the vents type of thing that had never been done before and Every you know Single-player FPS since is pretty much as the half-life clone of some sort trying to incorporate story.

744
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:37,450
Speaker 1: Yeah jumping like doom 3 seemed to solving physical puzzles type of thing.

745
00:51:37,535 --> 00:51:39,474
Speaker 1: Yeah Doom 3 same kind of thing.

746
00:51:39,715 --> 00:51:43,087
Speaker 0: because you notice we really kind of went off on the quakes and we didn't mention half-life.

747
00:51:43,307 --> 00:51:47,342
Speaker 0: because half-life is Like this parallel other structure of first-person shooters at this point.

748
00:51:47,563 --> 00:51:52,362
Speaker 0: Yep now and it's just as good It's just cuz the quake era kind of ended.

749
00:51:52,823 --> 00:51:54,470
Speaker 1: Well, it's a different beast altogether.

750
00:51:54,570 --> 00:52:00,668
Speaker 1: I mean that games that you play half-life, you know had mods like counter-strike which you know, isn't it all?

751
00:52:00,708 --> 00:52:04,502
Speaker 1: the Fast-paced runaround shooting guys first-person shooter.

752
00:52:04,542 --> 00:52:15,890
Speaker 1: It's the walk around slow strategy Which is kind of like what the game half-life was, you know The single-player quake - is run through the level and kill all the demons that you can and get the hell out.

753
00:52:16,693 --> 00:52:18,105
Speaker 1: Half-life was you know.

754
00:52:18,831 --> 00:52:26,827
Speaker 1: proceed carefully and manage your ammunition and only shoot guys you have to and try to survive and solve all the things.

755
00:52:26,908 --> 00:52:32,650
Speaker 1: and You know, it's like these physical puzzles not like Tomb Raider where it's like a block puzzle or whatever.

756
00:52:32,730 --> 00:52:37,570
Speaker 1: But like, you know, how am I gonna get over there with this thing in the way?

757
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:43,697
Speaker 1: Without dying and without using all my grenades and you know without You know falling in the pit.

758
00:52:43,778 --> 00:52:44,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, bro.

759
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:48,141
Speaker 0: Oh, there's a whole bunch of soldiers in that other room And I avoid them or do I have to kill them?

760
00:52:48,322 --> 00:52:49,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, what would be what what you know?

761
00:52:49,930 --> 00:52:53,389
Speaker 1: Is there a way I can sneak around this room and kill all the soldiers that them seeing me?

762
00:52:54,151 --> 00:52:54,513
Speaker 1: You know?

763
00:52:54,814 --> 00:52:57,285
Speaker 1: or how does a giant alien that my weapons don't affect?

764
00:52:57,345 --> 00:52:58,289
Speaker 1: What do I do to get rid of it?

765
00:52:59,751 --> 00:53:01,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, half-life was pretty cool.

766
00:53:01,264 --> 00:53:10,110
Speaker 0: But yep Yeah counter-strike the new one the source one is still pretty much the most played first-person shooter online as far as I can tell.

767
00:53:10,150 --> 00:53:11,376
Speaker 1: I mean, I can't look at the numbers.

768
00:53:12,039 --> 00:53:13,465
Speaker 0: It used to be easy to find those numbers.

769
00:53:13,525 --> 00:53:17,577
Speaker 1: It's not so easy anymore Yeah, but think about this for a game.

770
00:53:17,637 --> 00:53:23,211
Speaker 0: That's like how many years old at least our strike was a beta 5 before I'd even heard Of it.

771
00:53:23,553 --> 00:53:31,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, I played beta 5 for the tiniest bit amount of time, but At least 7 years old if not more maybe 10 years old.

772
00:53:33,212 --> 00:53:34,074
Speaker 1: Right 8 years old.

773
00:53:34,095 --> 00:53:34,416
Speaker 1: I don't know.

774
00:53:34,476 --> 00:53:36,944
Speaker 1: It's old and it's still played.

775
00:53:37,044 --> 00:53:48,790
Speaker 1: more than like 90% of probably Even brand new games will come out and everyone buys them and everyone immediately plays them and they still have less players than counter-strike has.

776
00:53:49,372 --> 00:54:01,210
Speaker 0: Is for every new game that came out like I'd get it and I play it and then I'd always end up just playing counter-strike Again, mm-hmm or playing actually natural selection is not hugely popular, but it has a very loyal fan base.

777
00:54:01,512 --> 00:54:02,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, well that comes way later.

778
00:54:03,061 --> 00:54:04,490
Speaker 0: the whole show on natural selection.

779
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:16,070
Speaker 1: Yeah the thing that made counter-strike so crazy was that number one was the first game that really had real guns and That kind of turned a lot of people on was hey That's actually a gun that exists in the real world.

780
00:54:16,090 --> 00:54:21,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, because a lot of geeks seem to have this kind of like military fetish where they like pistols or weapons or desert eagle 5-0.

781
00:54:22,473 --> 00:54:36,330
Speaker 1: Yep, the second thing about counter-strike was It had these new and interesting maps But they eventually became like home like two-fort was something that became home for everyone from Team Fortress But it wasn't new or interesting.

782
00:54:36,430 --> 00:54:42,590
Speaker 1: It was two-forts, you know with a bridge and some water in between but dust is actually pretty interesting.

783
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:47,770
Speaker 1: You've never been on it before and then eventually, you know, it feels like home and you don't like the back of your hand.

784
00:54:47,850 --> 00:54:51,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know every nook and cranny, you know where everyone's gonna be hiding.

785
00:54:51,327 --> 00:54:51,548
Speaker 0: It's just.

786
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:54,341
Speaker 1: it's feels really good to play on.

787
00:54:54,563 --> 00:55:02,309
Speaker 1: you know those old maps and The real deal with counter-strike was the objectives and the the no respawn.

788
00:55:02,429 --> 00:55:09,470
Speaker 1: because Before counter-strike, it was just common sense if you die in an FPS you come back and you're trying to get the most frags.

789
00:55:09,751 --> 00:55:10,294
Speaker 1: That was the only.

790
00:55:10,495 --> 00:55:13,210
Speaker 1: that was it was the only game was kill the most guys.

791
00:55:13,633 --> 00:55:15,789
Speaker 1: If you get killed you reappear to kill more guys.

792
00:55:16,171 --> 00:55:23,861
Speaker 0: So actually you realize that action quake had two modes and one mode was exactly like counter-strike But no one ever played that mode.

793
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:25,130
Speaker 0: actually that mode was played more.

794
00:55:25,230 --> 00:55:26,876
Speaker 0: That's the mode I played almost exclusively.

795
00:55:26,896 --> 00:55:28,984
Speaker 0: really you realize when I got action quake.

796
00:55:29,064 --> 00:55:31,552
Speaker 0: I didn't know there was a deathmatch Hmm.

797
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:34,270
Speaker 0: I only knew the team game and that's the one I played.

798
00:55:34,310 --> 00:55:37,264
Speaker 0: I actually played in a clan and I thought I played against a lot of clans.

799
00:55:37,284 --> 00:55:39,032
Speaker 0: I kind of played in a clan Huh?

800
00:55:39,574 --> 00:55:41,721
Speaker 0: I never saw that it was the primary.

801
00:55:41,741 --> 00:55:44,190
Speaker 1: knew there was a team mode, but I thought it was just kill the other team.

802
00:55:44,693 --> 00:55:49,530
Speaker 0: No, it was team versus team and a lot of them were killed the other team But they were like like you'd be on two sides of a cliff.

803
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:53,689
Speaker 0: There's a rail car between them like like suspended from raw wires going back and forth.

804
00:55:54,131 --> 00:55:58,469
Speaker 0: Or there'd be objectives like hit the switch or steal this briefcase or escape from this place.

805
00:55:59,252 --> 00:56:01,379
Speaker 1: No, that's not quite this but the thing is in counter-strike.

806
00:56:01,420 --> 00:56:04,410
Speaker 1: It was escape with the hostages or plant the bomb.

807
00:56:04,731 --> 00:56:08,649
Speaker 1: Oh and that the don't forget the the jail which they got rid of.

808
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:13,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, yes escape maps and a s assassinate maps assassinate maps were my favorite.

809
00:56:13,706 --> 00:56:14,930
Speaker 1: But what are you gonna do?

810
00:56:14,990 --> 00:56:16,937
Speaker 1: They took him out, but also action.

811
00:56:16,957 --> 00:56:18,201
Speaker 0: quake definitely had the.

812
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:20,007
Speaker 0: if you die you don't respawn.

813
00:56:20,569 --> 00:56:21,699
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah That was.

814
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:24,388
Speaker 1: that was pretty huge Was that you know?

815
00:56:24,951 --> 00:56:30,050
Speaker 1: The the dying and then you have to watch the game until the round is over because in a team game you have rounds.

816
00:56:30,372 --> 00:56:32,189
Speaker 1: You know when one team wins you start again.

817
00:56:32,752 --> 00:56:35,225
Speaker 1: It doesn't really work in a deathmatch where people die.

818
00:56:35,245 --> 00:56:36,150
Speaker 1: people come back, you know.

819
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:44,850
Speaker 1: But when you have a team game one team wins and the way it worked is as soon as you died You stayed out and I remember the first time someone told me that I was like what?

820
00:56:44,970 --> 00:56:45,976
Speaker 1: What are you talking?

821
00:56:45,996 --> 00:56:46,518
Speaker 1: That's crap.

822
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:47,443
Speaker 1: I want to keep playing.

823
00:56:47,504 --> 00:56:48,610
Speaker 1: I want to play a game like that.

824
00:56:48,751 --> 00:56:49,555
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

825
00:56:50,399 --> 00:56:52,550
Speaker 1: And then I realized Oh counter-strikes a free mod.

826
00:56:52,630 --> 00:56:59,546
Speaker 1: I didn't quite understand at that first and I got it and I was like, oh I get it.

827
00:57:00,831 --> 00:57:05,370
Speaker 1: And thus I played counter-strike up until I still played it yesterday day before.

828
00:57:05,785 --> 00:57:13,070
Speaker 0: Yeah I would have but I discovered when I booted into Windows that the fan on the GPU of my video card is not spinning anymore.

829
00:57:13,752 --> 00:57:19,690
Speaker 0: So my computer is fine in Linux because I don't really use the accelerated but the moment I start an OpenGL thing my computer crashes.

830
00:57:19,730 --> 00:57:22,683
Speaker 0: Hmm, so I got to fix that or buy a new computer.

831
00:57:22,703 --> 00:57:23,949
Speaker 0: All right, probably the latter.

832
00:57:24,711 --> 00:57:28,462
Speaker 1: Well, considering we haven't played a lot of the newer FPS is let's just fast forward.

833
00:57:28,964 --> 00:57:31,912
Speaker 1: tribes 2 is probably the best FPS ever Period.

834
00:57:32,093 --> 00:57:35,063
Speaker 0: yeah tribes 2 was a fantastic fucking game.

835
00:57:35,303 --> 00:57:35,484
Speaker 0: Yep.

836
00:57:35,765 --> 00:57:37,290
Speaker 0: Oh my god, and now it's dead.

837
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:38,945
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's so sad.

838
00:57:39,087 --> 00:57:39,410
Speaker 1: I mourn.

839
00:57:40,092 --> 00:57:45,810
Speaker 1: Half-life 2 was pretty much it was like the same thing as half-life 1, you know a great great awesome single-player.

840
00:57:46,652 --> 00:57:49,701
Speaker 1: They got this great physics engine, but it's really just like.

841
00:57:49,961 --> 00:57:51,245
Speaker 1: half-life is now upgraded.

842
00:57:51,305 --> 00:57:55,055
Speaker 1: They didn't really you know Revolutionize anything.

843
00:57:55,115 --> 00:57:58,010
Speaker 1: It's just a graphical and physical upgrade to half-life.

844
00:57:58,532 --> 00:58:02,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, so maybe in the future once we play more of these new games or have more to say about it.

845
00:58:02,990 --> 00:58:04,497
Speaker 0: We'll do another show a continuation.

846
00:58:04,557 --> 00:58:07,210
Speaker 0: But for now, that's really that's that's it.

847
00:58:07,710 --> 00:58:09,625
Speaker 0: FPS's are kind of a wayward thing for us.

848
00:58:09,948 --> 00:58:14,807
Speaker 1: Yeah Yes, that's partially because the Linux and partially because PC gaming is dying in general.

849
00:58:14,947 --> 00:58:20,970
Speaker 0: and yeah I mean, I'd like wanted to come back and maybe if the Xbox flops or depending on what happens.

850
00:58:21,130 --> 00:58:24,565
Speaker 0: But there haven't been many PC games that have excited me in a long time.

851
00:58:25,147 --> 00:58:25,870
Speaker 1: Yeah me either.

852
00:58:25,970 --> 00:58:31,411
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm more excited by counter-strike than I am about any game that's come out with the possible exception of Civ 4.

853
00:58:31,411 --> 00:58:33,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it seems like the PC's going.

854
00:58:33,157 --> 00:58:36,026
Speaker 1: mostly MMOs and there's still some FPS is like that.

855
00:58:36,066 --> 00:58:41,210
Speaker 1: battlefield 2 came out You know, my brother said it was pretty cool and he knows what's up because he plays counter.

856
00:58:41,310 --> 00:58:47,630
Speaker 1: He plays the real FPS's, you know, not the halos and things and I've been gonna talk about here because they're not really PC games.

857
00:58:48,733 --> 00:58:55,849
Speaker 1: but you know the More FPS is nowadays are just graphical upgrades not really adding anything.

858
00:58:56,850 --> 00:58:59,702
Speaker 1: Maybe there'll be an MMO FPS besides planetside.

859
00:58:59,722 --> 00:59:01,449
Speaker 1: that doesn't suck one day.
