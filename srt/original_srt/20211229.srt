1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:08,440
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:09,968
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, December 29th, 2021.

3
00:00:09,968 --> 00:00:10,329
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

4
00:00:13,986 --> 00:00:14,398
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,943
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

6
00:00:15,983 --> 00:00:24,700
Speaker 1: Tonight, in the last episode of 2021, we will be reviewing the French animated feature, The Summit of the Gods.

7
00:00:26,322 --> 00:00:27,357
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:29,681 --> 00:00:39,659
Speaker 1: So, uh, I've ended up for various reasons watching a lot of British game shows on YouTube, Taskmaster in particular, and also...

9
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,738
Speaker 0: That's all you got going on.

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:47,400
Speaker 1: But also a bunch of skiing videos, and, uh, also a bunch of true crime videos.

11
00:00:47,900 --> 00:01:02,600
Speaker 1: And it was interesting to see how people using our TV, and us using our TV, like our IP address, even if YouTube is not logged in, what YouTube thinks the people who tend to be in this house watching YouTube on the HDPC or from this IP address like to watch.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,299
Speaker 0: Well, if you're logged in, it will, you know...

13
00:01:05,963 --> 00:01:09,079
Speaker 1: If you're not logged in, it also definitely does that.

14
00:01:09,981 --> 00:01:11,766
Speaker 0: If you're not logged in, absolutely, right?

15
00:01:11,806 --> 00:01:16,800
Speaker 0: But if you're logged in, it will only check things that were viewed by that user that's logged in.

16
00:01:17,466 --> 00:01:18,300
Speaker 1: It is fascinating.

17
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:24,720
Speaker 0: I don't get recommendations for things that other people in the house watch, but as soon as you log out, suddenly you see all kinds of stuff.

18
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:31,439
Speaker 1: It is just fascinating to see what YouTube recommends when the HDPC is not logged in versus when I'm logged in.

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:36,218
Speaker 1: But at the same time, sometimes I'll see something interesting when I'm not logged in, and then I go to like it, like,

20
00:01:36,238 --> 00:01:36,278
Speaker 1: "Ah.".

21
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:42,280
Speaker 1: But then I have to log in to like it, and then it starts polluting my YouTube recommendation engine.

22
00:01:43,602 --> 00:01:46,460
Speaker 1: That was the most exciting thing I have to talk about since the last time we did a show.

23
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:50,320
Speaker 1: Everything that happened the previous week just disappeared from my brain.

24
00:01:51,061 --> 00:01:51,442
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know.

25
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:56,839
Speaker 0: I definitely had some opening bits, and I said before the last show, like, "Hey, we got a pile of opening bits because we haven't done a show in a

26
00:01:56,859 --> 00:01:57,020
Speaker 0: while.".

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,760
Speaker 0: But as soon as we do the show, we'll use like one of those bits, and all the other ones will disappear from our minds.

28
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:05,727
Speaker 1: It's like a write-many-read-once heap.

29
00:02:06,068 --> 00:02:12,960
Speaker 1: You put things in the heap, but if you ever read what's on top of the heap, like to say it on heap nights, the heap gets emptied instantly.

30
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, you get one random item, and then it's it.

31
00:02:16,362 --> 00:02:18,800
Speaker 0: Is there a game to be made with that mechanic?

32
00:02:19,261 --> 00:02:24,516
Speaker 1: So thanks to Google Photos, and it's like, "Hey, remember when you did

33
00:02:24,556 --> 00:02:24,717
Speaker 1: this?".

34
00:02:24,958 --> 00:02:25,820
Speaker 1: So we did do something.

35
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:36,540
Speaker 1: So over the weekend, we wanted to go hiking, but because of all the holiday travel, we did not want to leave the city because we did not have to deal with coming back into the city with a million million people traveling.

36
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:42,780
Speaker 1: So for the first time in my life, we did an urban hike, as in, we just started walking.

37
00:02:43,261 --> 00:02:51,020
Speaker 1: We walked up to Astoria over the RFK around Randall's Island, and we walked from the top of 125th Street down to Central Park and just kept going.

38
00:02:51,240 --> 00:02:55,760
Speaker 1: We went like, I forget how many miles we went, but we used to spend all day just walking through New York.

39
00:02:56,060 --> 00:03:02,933
Speaker 0: I mean, I've done the, not as like an intentional thing, like I'm going to walk, but I've been like, "I will go to that place.

40
00:03:03,094 --> 00:03:05,939
Speaker 0: I will walk to get there and have walked far as a

41
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:06,340
Speaker 0: result.".

42
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,700
Speaker 1: Yep, done that, but that was the furthest I've ever walked in one go in New York.

43
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:23,160
Speaker 0: I guess usually the circumstances where I did that were usually the weather's good, I'm in this place now, the next place I have to go is all the way over there, and I don't have to be at that place for a significant amount of time.

44
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,369
Speaker 0: If I take the train, I'm going to be sitting around there waiting.

45
00:03:25,389 --> 00:03:27,760
Speaker 0: I will walk there instead.

46
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:38,479
Speaker 1: Where I usually do that walk was either to MSG from like my work in ancient times when we would go to hockey games together, or walking to Astoria-Kaufman from home was like the other one.

47
00:03:39,942 --> 00:03:41,357
Speaker 0: Before there was a city bike, yeah.

48
00:03:42,002 --> 00:03:44,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, now there's a city bike, that kind of changed everything.

49
00:03:45,481 --> 00:03:48,928
Speaker 1: So, the walk was good, but it made me realize something.

50
00:03:49,689 --> 00:03:54,960
Speaker 1: I have not been in the interior of Central Park in like six years.

51
00:03:56,441 --> 00:03:57,439
Speaker 0: I think I biked through it this year.

52
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, I biked through it a bunch, but biking through Central Park, you bike around the big loop that mostly skirts the edge of the park.

53
00:04:03,642 --> 00:04:09,640
Speaker 1: All that interior stuff, like all those little paths, I basically haven't been in those things in forever, because even pre-Covid.

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Speaker 0: Oh, it depends which you're talking about, like the ramble or whatever?

55
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:22,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, the ramble, the walking, no bikes allowed path around the reservoir, like all those interior places, all those pavilions, the castle, like all that stuff.

56
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:23,503
Speaker 0: The zoo?

57
00:04:23,524 --> 00:04:24,359
Speaker 0: You go to the awful zoo?

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:29,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't go into the zoo because of Covid, but we walked top to bottom of the park in the interior.

59
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:36,980
Speaker 1: And it got to the point where I had to look on Google Maps to remember where certain landmarks were in the park, because I just didn't remember anymore.

60
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:38,513
Speaker 0: No, I know where they are.

61
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,780
Speaker 1: You know, what street is Belvedere Castle at?

62
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,200
Speaker 1: Is that north or south of the reservoir?

63
00:04:46,781 --> 00:04:49,797
Speaker 0: I don't know what street it is, but I could walk there if I was standing in the park.

64
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,080
Speaker 1: Is the ramble north or south of the reservoir?

65
00:04:55,101 --> 00:05:04,620
Speaker 0: I don't know where they are relatively, but I know if I'm standing at a spot that I could walk to any individual thing by looking around at like the buildings in the distance.

66
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:10,460
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah, but you pivoted pretty quick from "I still know where everything is" to not being able to answer even the most.

67
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:19,660
Speaker 0: You're asking like, because it's like, it's like, okay, if I see, you know, if I see X buildings in the distance, then I know that it's between those buildings and I walk in that direction.

68
00:05:20,222 --> 00:05:22,449
Speaker 0: And then you want me to find another thing?

69
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:26,100
Speaker 0: It's like, well, I'm not, I never found that thing relative to the second thing.

70
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:29,913
Speaker 1: But the reservoir is the largest and most obvious landmark.

71
00:05:29,953 --> 00:05:31,760
Speaker 1: that is the most walked past in the park.

72
00:05:33,523 --> 00:05:34,613
Speaker 0: There's a lot of water going on.

73
00:05:34,714 --> 00:05:35,199
Speaker 0: Anyway.

74
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:37,780
Speaker 1: Anyway, you got any news on this Wednesday?

75
00:05:39,542 --> 00:05:40,323
Speaker 0: What was my news?

76
00:05:40,383 --> 00:05:40,724
Speaker 0: All right.

77
00:05:40,784 --> 00:05:50,840
Speaker 0: So Urasawa, Naoki Urasawa, one of the best living manga creators who made many famous mangas that you hopefully have read.

78
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,885
Speaker 0: Asadora, his great new manga.

79
00:05:53,925 --> 00:05:59,819
Speaker 0: that is very obviously a manga that he made because it follows all of his typical storytelling tropes.

80
00:06:02,021 --> 00:06:06,536
Speaker 0: All of his, you know, signature moves are on display in that manga.

81
00:06:06,596 --> 00:06:07,900
Speaker 0: So if you like that, you should read it.

82
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:21,840
Speaker 0: But anyway, he has decided to release all or most, I guess not all, but the vast majority of the manga he's ever created in a digital format so that you can read it all.

83
00:06:22,621 --> 00:06:24,334
Speaker 0: However, it's not in English yet.

84
00:06:24,475 --> 00:06:25,200
Speaker 0: It's Japanese.

85
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:30,660
Speaker 0: So he's made a website and he made a YouTube video where he announced this on his own channel.

86
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:38,017
Speaker 0: And basically, yeah, crap ton of his manga, even going all the way back to like Yawara and stuff is available in Japanese.

87
00:06:38,118 --> 00:06:38,980
Speaker 0: More is coming.

88
00:06:39,601 --> 00:06:48,700
Speaker 0: He still seems to be hesitant about the manga of his I want to read most, which is Billy Bat, which is not on the list and is still not available in English.

89
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,880
Speaker 0: Maybe there is a pirated one trans cancellation out there somewhere.

90
00:06:53,042 --> 00:06:55,800
Speaker 1: Monster was not on the first list, but it's coming in February.

91
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,644
Speaker 0: Monster's coming.

92
00:06:58,808 --> 00:07:01,959
Speaker 0: But yeah, hopefully he can get on the English bandwagon with this.

93
00:07:03,302 --> 00:07:07,252
Speaker 1: Honestly, just the way business tends to go over there, I kind of give that a 50/50 shot.

94
00:07:07,673 --> 00:07:10,260
Speaker 1: I could see this easily being a Japanese exclusive forever.

95
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,243
Speaker 0: Somewhat unique, different case.

96
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:24,920
Speaker 0: But it is a thing where like, hey, all the Japanese media, right, mostly anime and manga, but also movies and other things, right?

97
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:30,660
Speaker 0: They're always having distributors and publishers and in between companies, right?

98
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:37,940
Speaker 0: And even when they sort of do it themselves, it's a Bandai visual situation when they do that, right?

99
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:45,078
Speaker 0: It's like, but here we have a situation where I guess he's, is he going through Shueisha or whatever his publisher is?

100
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:45,519
Speaker 0: I don't know.

101
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:50,900
Speaker 0: You know, Viz publishes his manga in the US, so I guess Viz would have to be involved.

102
00:07:51,561 --> 00:07:57,180
Speaker 1: He has a website for this now, and this is all only available in specific Japanese ebook stores.

103
00:07:59,320 --> 00:07:59,501
Speaker 0: Right.

104
00:08:00,243 --> 00:08:05,600
Speaker 0: But still, it's like, hey, he's basically sort of going direct-ish.

105
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:14,640
Speaker 0: And I'm waiting to see, because you see a lot of comic creators are effectively sort of going direct to the world with Webtoon, right?

106
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:19,600
Speaker 0: Because you get your comic on Webtoon, that's effectively like a worldwide distro, right?

107
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:26,420
Speaker 0: Because you can get Webtoon in almost any country, and it's usually, there's translations of things, right?

108
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:31,058
Speaker 0: Even us not speaking certain languages, we can get foreign Webtoons, right?

109
00:08:31,078 --> 00:08:31,580
Speaker 0: We can read them.

110
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,539
Speaker 0: They're in English, they've got subtitles or translations or whatever, some of them, a lot of them.

111
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,424
Speaker 0: So I'm waiting.

112
00:08:38,465 --> 00:08:51,080
Speaker 0: It's like, hey, is there going to be a big-time manga creator who's going to be like, you know what, I'm just going to, you know, not like webcomic, but like actually ebook published to the world in all the languages.

113
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:53,107
Speaker 1: Basically a modern webcomic.

114
00:08:53,388 --> 00:08:55,980
Speaker 1: I mean, I feel like that day is coming.

115
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,040
Speaker 1: Right.

116
00:08:57,481 --> 00:09:00,048
Speaker 0: And it's like, but do the English comic people, right?

117
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:04,540
Speaker 0: People in like the United States, you know, it's like, are they even doing that?

118
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:12,440
Speaker 0: You know, you can go to your Comixology and on Amazon or whatever and get all kinds of, you know, digital comics, you know, even mangas that are translated.

119
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,104
Speaker 0: But those are all from US distributors.

120
00:09:15,144 --> 00:09:17,989
Speaker 0: It's like, are any of them, right?

121
00:09:18,049 --> 00:09:24,680
Speaker 0: Like, is there anyone out there who makes an ebook in every language and just puts it out there for the whole world, right?

122
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, direct creators pretty much know.

123
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:28,700
Speaker 0: Usually it's prose and not graphic novels doing that.

124
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:38,520
Speaker 1: And the people in the US are on the avant-garde of that, like the ones who are doing a big English direct publishing of their own works online and with, maybe they partner with a publisher for the physical version.

125
00:09:39,241 --> 00:09:43,480
Speaker 1: They tend to publish only in English and really only go after the domestic market.

126
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,481
Speaker 0: I understand.

127
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:54,020
Speaker 0: You don't see too many ebooks for sale that are graphic novels that aren't through a publisher, distributor or something, right?

128
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:57,095
Speaker 0: The direct, like Kindle Direct is almost always just 100% prose.

129
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:05,840
Speaker 1: The funny thing is now would be a good time to do that because increasingly a lot of people have high resolution tablets or phones.

130
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,600
Speaker 0: A lot of people are just reading, you know, I stopped, I think this is actually, I guess, sort of an opening bit.

131
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:22,277
Speaker 0: So since April of 2006, every single month I've ordered pre-ordered comic books from DCBService.com, which is still a great business.

132
00:10:22,317 --> 00:10:23,880
Speaker 0: There's no complaint with them whatsoever.

133
00:10:25,221 --> 00:10:32,900
Speaker 0: And you basically, the way it works, I've talked about this a long time ago, you put in a pre-order out of, you know, the catalog of everything a comic book store can buy.

134
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:42,320
Speaker 0: And you pre-order two months in advance, you get a ridiculous discount and then starting two months after your first order, you just get boxes in the mail every month full of comics.

135
00:10:42,681 --> 00:10:47,899
Speaker 0: And that's how I filled up all these shelves over a zillion, you know, 15 years, something like that, right?

136
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,019
Speaker 1: As me, I'm just trying to get rid of as much paper in my house as I can.

137
00:10:52,320 --> 00:11:02,240
Speaker 0: Well, I'm also getting rid of, but you know, the point is, is there's some things, for example, I got 21, 22 volumes of One Punch Man over here, right?

138
00:11:02,861 --> 00:11:10,320
Speaker 0: And I was digging it, and then over time I stopped digging it as much because it sort of fell into a quagmire plot-wise, right?

139
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,647
Speaker 0: And now it's like, I'm sort of satisfied.

140
00:11:12,687 --> 00:11:17,200
Speaker 0: I've had enough One Punch Man and/or I can just read the rest digitally.

141
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,041
Speaker 0: I don't feel like.

142
00:11:18,282 --> 00:11:29,020
Speaker 0: even if I, you know, the level that I enjoy One Punch Man, which of the early volumes is a great deal, I don't really feel the need to own the volumes, right?

143
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,269
Speaker 0: Like, some of these I gotta own, right?

144
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,400
Speaker 0: Especially ones that aren't gonna be available.

145
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:39,080
Speaker 1: I mean, there's a reason I'm not getting rid of that barely-held-together sanctuary or eagle that I got back there.

146
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:39,441
Speaker 0: Right.

147
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:42,947
Speaker 0: Or, you know, some of these books are legendary, right?

148
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:50,560
Speaker 0: But some of them, it's like, okay, you know, I'm not gonna read this again in my life, right?

149
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:55,000
Speaker 0: I'm only gonna live this one time, so I don't need them anymore.

150
00:11:55,340 --> 00:12:03,560
Speaker 0: And also, it's like, like Rim was starting to explain, the reading experience of the digital comics has improved a significant deal.

151
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,589
Speaker 0: I'm reading Chainsaw Man entirely digitally.

152
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,880
Speaker 0: I've never owned a volume of Chainsaw Man, and I never will.

153
00:12:08,221 --> 00:12:08,442
Speaker 0: Right?

154
00:12:08,823 --> 00:12:09,665
Speaker 0: I'm enjoying it a lot.

155
00:12:09,725 --> 00:12:10,126
Speaker 0: It's great.

156
00:12:10,327 --> 00:12:11,269
Speaker 0: We did an episode on it.

157
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:14,318
Speaker 0: But, I'm only just reading it digitally.

158
00:12:14,338 --> 00:12:14,920
Speaker 0: That's it.

159
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:15,329
Speaker 0: Yup.

160
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:20,213
Speaker 0: So, because of, and also, a lot of things I was reading, right?

161
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,340
Speaker 0: So, for example, City over there, right?

162
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,086
Speaker 0: I feel like I'm gonna keep City.

163
00:12:24,186 --> 00:12:24,588
Speaker 0: I own it.

164
00:12:24,648 --> 00:12:27,540
Speaker 0: I'll probably read it again before in my life, so I'm not gonna get rid of it.

165
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,888
Speaker 0: But, it's one volume left.

166
00:12:29,908 --> 00:12:30,410
Speaker 0: That's over.

167
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,615
Speaker 0: It's done.

168
00:12:31,836 --> 00:12:32,920
Speaker 0: It's like there's no more to buy.

169
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:36,708
Speaker 0: So, as things ended, I'm ordering less.

170
00:12:36,748 --> 00:12:42,340
Speaker 0: So, actually, I didn't, for the first time in 15, 16 years, I didn't put in an order at all.

171
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,735
Speaker 0: There was nothing to order in the whole order form that I wanted.

172
00:12:45,855 --> 00:12:46,920
Speaker 0: that was worth ordering.

173
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:47,200
Speaker 1: Yup.

174
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:54,300
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll admit my comic reading has dried up to near zero, partly just during the pandemic, because most of the time I'm reading comics is traveling.

175
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:57,720
Speaker 1: I'll like burn through a whole series on like a work trip.

176
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:03,700
Speaker 0: I'm reading more, 'cause I finally have time to catch up on all these ones that I bought and didn't read yet.

177
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:12,780
Speaker 0: But, I'm buying less, because, you know, things, it's just less, the quantity of things that are coming out that I don't already own.

178
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:23,880
Speaker 0: 'Cause, you know, 'cause when I started buying, there was this decades of backlog of things I hadn't- Kinda like when we first started watching anime, there was a decades deep backlog of top tier anime.

179
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:29,080
Speaker 0: And by the time that I caught up on that backlog, there was a second backlog, right?

180
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:34,259
Speaker 0: But after a few waves, you know, the waveform, the amplitude gets down, right?

181
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,945
Speaker 0: I mean, look at games!

182
00:13:36,165 --> 00:13:40,720
Speaker 1: I am just now working on finishing the campaign in Radio Commander.

183
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:44,059
Speaker 1: A game that I bought so many years ago, I struggle to say what year I bought it.

184
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:52,680
Speaker 0: Well, games take a lot longer to play, so the rate at which they come out versus the rate at which you can play them, it's like you can't catch up.

185
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:57,800
Speaker 0: But comics, it's like, I have a stack down there, I have every volume of Full Metal Alchemist, right?

186
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,168
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read it all and get rid of it.

187
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:01,060
Speaker 0: Probably to book off or something.

188
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:04,660
Speaker 0: Or maybe to Second Dibs, who knows, right?

189
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:10,960
Speaker 0: But, to read all those volumes, which I haven't done yet, I've read some of them, is not gonna take very long at all.

190
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:15,740
Speaker 0: It's like twenty-something volumes, that'll take me what, like a couple days, right?

191
00:14:16,021 --> 00:14:17,419
Speaker 0: Way less time than Telegenji.

192
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:21,540
Speaker 1: Well, that was a matter partly of willpower.

193
00:14:24,062 --> 00:14:24,846
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
00:14:24,866 --> 00:14:27,597
Speaker 0: So, yeah, Urasawa's going digital, which is kind of a big deal.

195
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:30,048
Speaker 1: Yeah, curious to see where it goes.

196
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,339
Speaker 1: I never actually finished Twentieth Century, boys.

197
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,552
Speaker 0: It's got an ending.

198
00:14:36,181 --> 00:14:36,382
Speaker 1: Yeah.

199
00:14:36,422 --> 00:14:37,788
Speaker 1: Monster is still, I think...

200
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,470
Speaker 0: Monster is much better.

201
00:14:42,721 --> 00:14:46,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, Monster hit multiple points along the way where I thought, alright, it seems like this is wrapping.

202
00:14:47,463 --> 00:14:48,495
Speaker 1: Oh, there it goes.

203
00:14:50,661 --> 00:14:53,620
Speaker 1: So I got a couple of quick little geek bites.

204
00:14:54,402 --> 00:14:58,120
Speaker 1: So I did watch with Emily just recently, because it just came out on streaming.

205
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,060
Speaker 1: Disney's latest animated feature, Encanto.

206
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:04,260
Speaker 0: I didn't even know this existed, so you said something.

207
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,680
Speaker 0: It is absolutely fantastic.

208
00:15:07,262 --> 00:15:12,260
Speaker 1: I will say, and it pains me to say this, it is materially better than Raya.

209
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:16,360
Speaker 1: And I really liked Raya, but this is just a better film.

210
00:15:16,760 --> 00:15:17,519
Speaker 1: Like, hands down.

211
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:23,340
Speaker 1: It's tighter, it's a musical, like a full-on stage musical, basically.

212
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:31,700
Speaker 1: To the point that they choreographed physical act singers and dancers doing these scenes like it was a stage play as reference for the animation.

213
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,599
Speaker 1: The songs are great, the characters are great.

214
00:15:34,842 --> 00:15:38,080
Speaker 1: And all I can say is, I highly recommend you watch it.

215
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:40,216
Speaker 1: We'll review it at some point, whenever Scott sees it.

216
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:42,586
Speaker 1: I'll just leave it at that.

217
00:15:42,606 --> 00:15:44,195
Speaker 1: I love the shit out of this movie.

218
00:15:44,215 --> 00:15:45,140
Speaker 1: I kind of want to watch it again.

219
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,059
Speaker 1: It's just a spectacle.

220
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:49,220
Speaker 0: It's going to take a while for me to get back to the Disney+, right?

221
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:57,180
Speaker 0: We're currently getting close to canceling Netflix, and then, you know, going to be all HBO Max for a while.

222
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,700
Speaker 0: Yep, the trouble is... Because Disney+ will come next in the queue.

223
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:09,818
Speaker 1: We finished Lupin, and I thought, "Maybe we can cancel Netflix, watch all the other stuff, and pick Netflix back up once Dragon Prince comes back, and Arcane season 2 comes

224
00:16:09,879 --> 00:16:10,099
Speaker 1: back.".

225
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,800
Speaker 1: But we just started watching Centaurworld last night, and I gotta geek-bite that show, because...

226
00:16:16,943 --> 00:16:18,400
Speaker 0: I heard that it's kind of wild.

227
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:23,839
Speaker 1: It's both exactly what I expected, and nothing like I expected at the same time.

228
00:16:24,603 --> 00:16:25,589
Speaker 1: It is... interesting.

229
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:37,740
Speaker 1: The way I will describe it, having watched a bunch of season 1, is that half of it is take Adventure Time, but just do the weird Pendleton Ward stuff.

230
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:43,240
Speaker 1: But instead of going weird and navel-gazing, just go absolutely nuts.

231
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:53,980
Speaker 1: But then, frame it with a 100% dead serious, animated in a completely different style for real fantasy drama.

232
00:16:54,882 --> 00:16:56,139
Speaker 1: That is very gritty and real.

233
00:16:56,980 --> 00:17:06,440
Speaker 1: And the dichotomy between those two stories, and where they seem to eventually be on a course for intersection, that is the story.

234
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:11,660
Speaker 1: It's abstract and weird, and it's also extremely musical.

235
00:17:11,761 --> 00:17:14,359
Speaker 1: There's a song, like, every few minutes in the show.

236
00:17:15,380 --> 00:17:15,742
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

237
00:17:15,983 --> 00:17:18,680
Speaker 0: It's not like Adventure Time, where it's like, song once in a while.

238
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:27,260
Speaker 1: It is like, songs move the plot, and songs might literally be happening for real as magic in the show itself.

239
00:17:29,181 --> 00:17:47,280
Speaker 1: It's also very high concept, in that it almost seems to be going for this angle where the Centaurworld, with this ridiculous nonsense, it's like a magical world cut off from the rest of reality, where people are basically gods, but also don't face any conflict anymore, and might have turned themselves stupid?

240
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:49,786
Speaker 1: It's hard to say.

241
00:17:49,806 --> 00:17:52,120
Speaker 1: I haven't seen enough to know where this is really going yet.

242
00:17:54,630 --> 00:17:56,749
Speaker 0: Oh good, they've cancelled the rest of the kids' hockey.

243
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:56,910
Speaker 0: Good.

244
00:17:57,470 --> 00:17:59,709
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, I've seen- They shouldn't have started, but okay.

245
00:17:59,750 --> 00:18:05,068
Speaker 1: A whole bunch of minor leagues across a lot of sports have cancelled in the last 24 hours.

246
00:18:06,772 --> 00:18:10,750
Speaker 1: A whole bunch of high school stuff got shut down in the last 48 hours too, sports-wise.

247
00:18:11,551 --> 00:18:11,883
Speaker 0: Good.

248
00:18:11,925 --> 00:18:12,049
Speaker 0: Good.

249
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:15,890
Speaker 1: So yeah, I highly recommend watching at least one episode of Centaurworld.

250
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:20,410
Speaker 1: That is enough to know if you're willing to see more or not, just one episode.

251
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:30,830
Speaker 1: Because you will see both sides of that, like, the dichotomy in that one episode, and those two threads continue in every episode I've seen so far.

252
00:18:36,731 --> 00:18:39,090
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day!

253
00:18:39,531 --> 00:18:41,336
Speaker 1: So I don't know much about this show yet.

254
00:18:41,838 --> 00:18:45,870
Speaker 1: I've found a place where I can watch the first episode of it.

255
00:18:47,091 --> 00:18:48,835
Speaker 1: I gotta figure out where to watch it for real.

256
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:54,670
Speaker 1: I'm sure there's a fan community with English subtitles, kind of like with a lot of Korean dramas where we can see this.

257
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:58,130
Speaker 1: But I'll link to this tweet that got me excited.

258
00:18:59,492 --> 00:19:05,129
Speaker 1: It's just a clip from this show that's very popular in China that seems to be running right now.

259
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:16,230
Speaker 1: And the way it seems to go down, this show is just 24, like the American show 24, but set during the Tang Dynasty in China.

260
00:19:17,771 --> 00:19:22,270
Speaker 1: And it looks absolutely bonkers, and I am absolutely going to watch.

261
00:19:22,550 --> 00:19:23,629
Speaker 0: There's a lot of ones like that.

262
00:19:24,812 --> 00:19:24,913
Speaker 1: Yep.

263
00:19:25,153 --> 00:19:30,949
Speaker 1: Kind of like when we saw the trailer for Kung Fu Hustle with the axis, and we were like, "Whatever the fuck that is, we have to watch it as soon as

264
00:19:30,989 --> 00:19:31,390
Speaker 1: possible.".

265
00:19:32,093 --> 00:19:35,510
Speaker 1: It scratched that itch in a way that nothing has scratched in a while.

266
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,822
Speaker 1: Like, here's some Kung Fu-looking historical drama nonsense.

267
00:19:41,484 --> 00:19:43,670
Speaker 1: I'm definitely going to watch an episode of this soon.

268
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:45,089
Speaker 1: And I'll let you know.

269
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:49,130
Speaker 0: That's something that I've always talked about, is how you look in the US, right?

270
00:19:49,511 --> 00:19:50,674
Speaker 0: Look at US television.

271
00:19:51,136 --> 00:19:55,770
Speaker 0: There's big shows, legendary shows, especially in the sitcom department, right?

272
00:19:55,810 --> 00:20:01,830
Speaker 0: You get your Seinfelds and your Friendses and your Cheerses, right?

273
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:05,170
Speaker 0: Like these mega Dallases, these big, big shows.

274
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:10,470
Speaker 1: See, the finale of M*A*S*H was like a mass cultural event in the United States.

275
00:20:10,671 --> 00:20:11,569
Speaker 0: At the time, right?

276
00:20:11,930 --> 00:20:17,810
Speaker 0: But at any given time, it's like, let's see, NBC sitcoms right now.

277
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:18,630
Speaker 1: Like, what's the big show?

278
00:20:19,533 --> 00:20:19,775
Speaker 0: Right?

279
00:20:19,795 --> 00:20:21,629
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, okay, so you got like, what's it?

280
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:22,952
Speaker 0: Mr.

281
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:24,770
Speaker 0: Mayor, I don't even know what the heck that is.

282
00:20:24,931 --> 00:20:26,009
Speaker 0: I have no idea what that is.

283
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:29,770
Speaker 0: Young Rock, I guess it's The Rock, right?

284
00:20:30,837 --> 00:20:32,450
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, there are these shows.

285
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:34,489
Speaker 0: You know, let's see, CBS sitcoms.

286
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:38,710
Speaker 0: There are shows that are like, they're on, you know, broadcast TV.

287
00:20:39,371 --> 00:20:41,730
Speaker 0: They're like big, you know, they're in this country.

288
00:20:41,831 --> 00:20:44,530
Speaker 0: But like anyone in any country doesn't know what the hell these are, right?

289
00:20:44,610 --> 00:20:51,429
Speaker 0: Unless they become, you know, big enough to be like, say like The Office, where like you start getting adaptations in other countries and stuff, right?

290
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:56,130
Speaker 0: But they can still have some large-ish significance, right?

291
00:20:56,730 --> 00:21:01,150
Speaker 0: Some, you know, and then other countries have shows of that level, right?

292
00:21:01,251 --> 00:21:02,769
Speaker 0: Every country does, right?

293
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:05,870
Speaker 0: But you basically can't see any of them, right?

294
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,549
Speaker 0: Outside of the countries that they are from.

295
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:12,070
Speaker 0: You know, it's like they're unique to that place only.

296
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:15,526
Speaker 0: Those are never getting translated, exported, whatever, right?

297
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,130
Speaker 1: And even when that happens, people outside of that market often don't understand.

298
00:21:22,032 --> 00:21:29,310
Speaker 1: Like, explaining to people outside of Europe or who are deep into comics how big the Disney ducks are in the entire world, except the US.

299
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:30,385
Speaker 0: Right.

300
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:36,688
Speaker 0: You know, this is something like a, I don't know, like a Saved by the Bell tier of show, right?

301
00:21:37,770 --> 00:21:41,590
Speaker 0: It's like, there are Saved by the Bell tier things all around the world, you know?

302
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:45,670
Speaker 0: There's a Chinese one, an Indian one, you know, one from Uganda.

303
00:21:46,191 --> 00:21:48,127
Speaker 0: There's every country, you know, Russian ones, right?

304
00:21:49,472 --> 00:21:51,389
Speaker 0: Brazilian ones, everywhere, they got them.

305
00:21:51,792 --> 00:21:54,230
Speaker 0: And you just, you're never going to see them unless you live in that country.

306
00:21:54,810 --> 00:22:02,709
Speaker 1: Thanks a lot, now my brain, like this ridiculous, memetic, Pavlovian response, the entire theme song of Saved by the Bell is literally stuck in my head now.

307
00:22:04,431 --> 00:22:06,650
Speaker 1: It's all right because I'm Saved by the Bell.

308
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:08,189
Speaker 1: Anyway, what do you got?

309
00:22:09,335 --> 00:22:09,538
Speaker 0: What?

310
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:10,350
Speaker 0: Oh, my thing of the day.

311
00:22:10,410 --> 00:22:15,970
Speaker 0: So, this thing has gotten really popular over the past, I guess, maybe week or two.

312
00:22:15,990 --> 00:22:24,790
Speaker 0: I don't know, but it's just this website with this little word game and it updates with a new word every day.

313
00:22:24,931 --> 00:22:32,930
Speaker 0: I don't know how long it's existed for, but the reason it's gotten popular is they have a very clever social media sharing mechanism.

314
00:22:33,771 --> 00:22:40,230
Speaker 0: And so, the way the game works is you get a word, you know, I think it's a six letter word every day, five letter word.

315
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:42,810
Speaker 0: And you just guess what word it is.

316
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:49,670
Speaker 0: You just type in five letters and it will tell you of the five letters you typed in, right, which I think have to be a word.

317
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:51,790
Speaker 0: I don't think you can just type in five random letters.

318
00:22:51,870 --> 00:22:53,690
Speaker 0: You can't just be like R-S-T-L-A, right?

319
00:22:56,171 --> 00:23:00,850
Speaker 0: It'll tell you if a letter is gray, that means that letter is not in the correct word.

320
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:06,070
Speaker 0: If a letter is green, that is a letter that is in the word and is in the correct position.

321
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:09,870
Speaker 0: And if it's yellow, that letter is in the word, but it's in a different position.

322
00:23:10,372 --> 00:23:13,907
Speaker 0: And so, you just keep guessing and you try to guess, you know, in...

323
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, it will not let you type in a word that is not a word.

324
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:18,771
Speaker 0: Yeah.

325
00:23:19,152 --> 00:23:23,450
Speaker 0: So, I've got, you know, I tried it yesterday and today.

326
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:28,410
Speaker 0: And yesterday, I think it took me three guesses and today it took me like two guesses.

327
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:31,269
Speaker 0: You know, I did pretty good, but I forgot to share it.

328
00:23:31,470 --> 00:23:38,324
Speaker 0: And sharing is the important part because after you get the answer, if you click share, let's say you tweet, right?

329
00:23:38,344 --> 00:23:39,530
Speaker 0: Let's say you tweet your answer out.

330
00:23:40,371 --> 00:23:49,258
Speaker 0: It'll tell you, everyone else, your score, but in your tweet, it uses like emojis and Unicode to make a little grid of squares.

331
00:23:49,699 --> 00:23:52,890
Speaker 0: that shows how, you know, your solving process.

332
00:23:53,051 --> 00:23:56,348
Speaker 0: Like, oh, my first guess, it was all yellow and my second guess, it was all green.

333
00:23:56,428 --> 00:23:58,057
Speaker 0: somehow, if that was possible, right?

334
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,670
Speaker 0: But no one knows what word you guessed.

335
00:24:01,071 --> 00:24:06,350
Speaker 0: They just know that you can just see how well you did just by looking at that colored grid of blocks.

336
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:09,205
Speaker 1: I'm trying for the first time right now and it's real fun.

337
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:14,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you can only play it once a day because they only change the word once a day.

338
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:22,350
Speaker 0: So, it's like if you play it on your phone and get it right, you can just go to your computer and just type in the right answer and get it in one shot, but who cares?

339
00:24:23,030 --> 00:24:24,764
Speaker 0: It's like a big deal, right?

340
00:24:24,784 --> 00:24:25,470
Speaker 0: That's not the point.

341
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:27,536
Speaker 0: And it's just a website.

342
00:24:27,556 --> 00:24:28,521
Speaker 0: You go to it and you play it.

343
00:24:28,621 --> 00:24:30,270
Speaker 0: It's the same word for everybody every day.

344
00:24:30,331 --> 00:24:31,729
Speaker 0: So, don't let anyone tell you what the word is.

345
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:38,470
Speaker 1: It's got a good UX too in that I like how the keyboard updates to remind you what letters you've used or not so you can just focus on the puzzle itself.

346
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:40,755
Speaker 0: Also, I realize there's a hard mode.

347
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:46,450
Speaker 0: Hard mode means that all revealed letters must be used on subsequent guesses.

348
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:51,010
Speaker 0: And unbeknownst to me, and on my first day, I was just playing hard mode.

349
00:24:51,991 --> 00:24:56,090
Speaker 0: I was forcing the hard mode rules on myself because I thought that was the best strategy.

350
00:24:57,091 --> 00:25:08,970
Speaker 0: But apparently, I guess a pro or a move might be to guess two unrelated words that don't share any letters first and then you'll have enough to work with and just nail it on the third one with more consistency.

351
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:12,890
Speaker 0: But I was imposing the hard rule restriction on myself naturally.

352
00:25:14,191 --> 00:25:16,129
Speaker 0: So, I feel like I'll just enable it from now on.

353
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,569
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek Night's Book Club book, Taylor Genji.

354
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:23,910
Speaker 1: I propose we do it at the end of January, but it's up to you at this point.

355
00:25:24,355 --> 00:25:25,429
Speaker 1: I'm going to steamroll through.

356
00:25:26,170 --> 00:25:28,744
Speaker 0: I'm hoping we're going to get through it somehow.

357
00:25:28,885 --> 00:25:29,730
Speaker 0: We're going to make it happen.

358
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:42,469
Speaker 1: I slowed down a little because now when I read a chapter, I'm then going and reading a short summary of that chapter from one of those literary guides just to make sure I didn't miss anything super obvious and to remember who the characters were.

359
00:25:43,831 --> 00:25:51,030
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's actually slowing me down though because I kind of read the chapter faster now that I'm doing this because I know I have this safety net at the end of the chapter.

360
00:25:51,513 --> 00:25:52,016
Speaker 1: So, we'll see.

361
00:25:52,036 --> 00:25:52,802
Speaker 1: That might be a technique.

362
00:25:52,822 --> 00:25:53,969
Speaker 1: if any of you are slowing down.

363
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,012
Speaker 0: Yeah.

364
00:25:56,273 --> 00:26:01,430
Speaker 0: I'm actually working on the Geek Night's website more than I'm reading the book, which may be a problem.

365
00:26:02,111 --> 00:26:02,862
Speaker 0: But that's also not a problem.

366
00:26:04,251 --> 00:26:10,930
Speaker 1: I'm working idly on a panel that I'm just going to do online as me because definitely not going to MagFest.

367
00:26:11,171 --> 00:26:14,769
Speaker 1: If it was not obvious, we will not be at MagFest, which is coming up pretty soon.

368
00:26:16,130 --> 00:26:19,230
Speaker 0: The PAX East isn't looking likely unless some kind of great thing happens.

369
00:26:19,711 --> 00:26:21,116
Speaker 0: Which is possible.

370
00:26:21,377 --> 00:26:23,424
Speaker 0: I hope it's possible, but very unlikely.

371
00:26:23,504 --> 00:26:24,587
Speaker 0: I wouldn't bet a penny.

372
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:33,270
Speaker 1: But MagFest is happening basically a week right in the danger zone of the spike that's going to be caused by the holidays.

373
00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:34,690
Speaker 0: I'm not going anywhere near that MagFest.

374
00:26:34,930 --> 00:26:35,092
Speaker 0: Nope.

375
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,024
Speaker 1: In fact...

376
00:26:36,510 --> 00:26:36,893
Speaker 0: Zero percent.

377
00:26:37,176 --> 00:26:37,640
Speaker 0: Negative 1,000% chance.

378
00:26:39,190 --> 00:26:44,610
Speaker 1: A few weeks ago, I was willing to go to PAX Unplugged for three hours to do a panel wearing a mask the whole time, even on stage.

379
00:26:45,011 --> 00:26:50,170
Speaker 1: If PAX Unplugged had been the weekend of MagFest, as opposed to then, I would have bailed.

380
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:53,725
Speaker 1: For the first time in my life, I would have called the PAX and said, "Sorry, we can't

381
00:26:53,766 --> 00:26:54,067
Speaker 1: perform.".

382
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:57,597
Speaker 1: But that panel is on YouTube.

383
00:26:57,858 --> 00:27:01,550
Speaker 1: If you want to see it, despite the mask, the audio sounds just fine.

384
00:27:02,190 --> 00:27:10,770
Speaker 1: One thing I will share, because it's the meta moment, this was the hardest audio engineering exercise I have ever done with one exception on a panel.

385
00:27:11,132 --> 00:27:14,089
Speaker 1: It is really hard to record someone who's wearing a mask and giving a talk.

386
00:27:14,791 --> 00:27:15,714
Speaker 1: Good lord.

387
00:27:16,275 --> 00:27:22,550
Speaker 1: But I did it, so watch this video if for nothing else than to appreciate how fucking good of a job I did.

388
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:23,605
Speaker 0: You could have dubbed it.

389
00:27:25,632 --> 00:27:26,056
Speaker 1: You know what?

390
00:27:26,116 --> 00:27:27,749
Speaker 1: I could have, because YouTube subtitles...

391
00:27:27,890 --> 00:27:29,749
Speaker 0: You could have just given it again when you got home.

392
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:30,894
Speaker 1: I could have ADR'd it.

393
00:27:31,075 --> 00:27:34,610
Speaker 1: The problem is, I did not script this panel.

394
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:41,470
Speaker 1: Because when you and I do a lecture together, we tend to script a lot more in terms of what we're going to say on each slide.

395
00:27:41,911 --> 00:27:49,730
Speaker 1: When I do talks by myself, I tend to riff a lot more and often go off in strange tangents based on how the audience is reacting.

396
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:51,882
Speaker 0: But you need more tangents because you got less time.

397
00:27:51,902 --> 00:27:52,969
Speaker 0: You got more time to fill in.

398
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:53,511
Speaker 1: Exactly.

399
00:27:53,611 --> 00:28:02,690
Speaker 1: But also, I need clever ways to get the audience to laugh, to react enough to give me a break, to like, take a sip of water, collect my thoughts, take a breath.

400
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:10,430
Speaker 1: Usually I say something controversial that you'll react to or hand the baton to you, so I have like 30 seconds to do that.

401
00:28:11,032 --> 00:28:15,810
Speaker 1: It is more than twice as hard to do a one-hour lecture by yourself than to do it with a partner, is all I'm saying.

402
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:20,161
Speaker 0: Yeah, 30 minutes versus an hour, yeah.

403
00:28:20,302 --> 00:28:21,927
Speaker 0: Even if we don't split the time 50/50, it's still...

404
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:26,990
Speaker 1: Yep, still just having that relief to take a break is a big deal.

405
00:28:27,751 --> 00:28:31,905
Speaker 1: Or, Scott will say a point that I forgot to get to and vice versa.

406
00:28:31,925 --> 00:28:33,270
Speaker 1: All that kind of dynamic happens too.

407
00:28:34,132 --> 00:28:35,483
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's on YouTube.

408
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:36,169
Speaker 1: You can just watch it.

409
00:28:36,631 --> 00:28:41,350
Speaker 1: I feel like this panel is basically complete, so I don't think we need to run it again anytime soon.

410
00:28:41,530 --> 00:28:48,550
Speaker 0: Maybe when I finish all this website book stuff, we'll get back to, you know, lecturing, paneling, something along those lines.

411
00:28:49,251 --> 00:28:49,351
Speaker 1: Yep.

412
00:28:49,371 --> 00:29:01,790
Speaker 1: Oh, actually, a little bird told me that Zenkai Con, which I'm not going to physically, very likely, considering the circumstances, but they're gonna have an online panel track despite having a physical con.

413
00:29:02,473 --> 00:29:03,929
Speaker 0: Will anyone come to it, though?

414
00:29:05,013 --> 00:29:05,775
Speaker 1: A lot of people.

415
00:29:06,998 --> 00:29:12,934
Speaker 1: Not enough for anyone to make money off of this, but there is a significant contingent of people, and there's some data to back this up.

416
00:29:13,356 --> 00:29:28,890
Speaker 1: Not enough for big companies or big cons to care, but definitely enough for small cons to care, who want to go to cons for various reasons, often due to disability or lack of money, can't go to cons, and they will voraciously consume online video content of panels.

417
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:31,837
Speaker 0: So my question to the listener is this, right?

418
00:29:31,898 --> 00:29:49,730
Speaker 0: Let's say I did a panel, and then it's like, I could just put it on YouTube right away, but would, if you went to an online convention and they just showed a video that was already on YouTube, would that feel like cheapen it, or would you not care?

419
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:56,290
Speaker 1: Oh, but no, the main reason they're doing this is to also stream those panels on their YouTube channel during the con.

420
00:29:57,331 --> 00:30:07,810
Speaker 0: Right, but it's like, or do I have, the question is really, do I have to sort of withhold the content so that the convention gets an exclusive first, or do I not have to do that?

421
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:13,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know, PAX wasn't super clear on that, I just uploaded to the panel a couple weeks after PAX, just as a courtesy.

422
00:30:13,550 --> 00:30:15,054
Speaker 0: Right, but it's like, do I have to do that?

423
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:20,730
Speaker 0: It's like people who are attending the online con are very unlikely to have been to my YouTube channel on their own.

424
00:30:20,870 --> 00:30:20,963
Speaker 0: True.

425
00:30:23,632 --> 00:30:36,810
Speaker 0: So, it's like, and regardless, it's like, so could I do a thing where it's like, I just record panels, should I just upload them all to YouTube and then tell conventions, yeah, you want some content, check out my YouTube channel, pick any video, show it, right?

426
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:44,970
Speaker 0: Or, do I have to stock up, send them to conventions, and then once all the conventions are done, then put it on the YouTube channel?

427
00:30:45,271 --> 00:31:00,309
Speaker 1: So, I can't announce anything yet, because nothing has been done, but I have been talking to someone who works with a large convention, and we have an ongoing conversation now about interest in using the Geek Nights back catalogue of lectures we've given.

428
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:04,836
Speaker 0: Creative Commons license, go wild, it's all yours.

429
00:31:05,297 --> 00:31:10,990
Speaker 0: Creative Commons, I can't stop you, even if I wanted to, I can't stop you, too late, past me already didn't stop you.

430
00:31:11,331 --> 00:31:15,850
Speaker 0: So, I can't stop past me either, past me is already gone down that road.

431
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:35,420
Speaker 1: The other thing that I guess I'll ask the listener while we're on the stack, then we'll get into the main bit, because this movie was great, but I feel like if we, if Scott and I just record a panel on our own, like if we just do it not for a convention, because there's some topics we've wanted to do a panel on, but the con situation's still in flux, because of COVID, I feel like it's more fun.

432
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:49,316
Speaker 1: for me at least, I don't know about you, Scott, I've enjoyed when we've given a panel to a con, and then being able to just sit in the chat and react to people who are watching it live for the first time in a group, so I kind of want to use the YouTube Premiere capability.

433
00:31:49,597 --> 00:31:55,850
Speaker 1: if we record a panel that's not for a con, so that it airs for the first time at like 8pm Eastern on Saturday.

434
00:31:55,990 --> 00:31:58,930
Speaker 0: We could do that, we could try that one time, make a YouTube Premiere.

435
00:31:59,791 --> 00:32:06,970
Speaker 1: Because I think it would be fun to be able to hang out in the chat without having to be on stage, because there's a lot of reasons we don't take questions on stage.

436
00:32:07,051 --> 00:32:09,069
Speaker 0: If we just had video and screen sharing, we'd be set.

437
00:32:09,270 --> 00:32:13,097
Speaker 1: There's no way that is not in the Discord hopper, that has to be like- What's taking so long?

438
00:32:13,117 --> 00:32:14,330
Speaker 0: What's taking so long?

439
00:32:14,472 --> 00:32:14,650
Speaker 0: Right?

440
00:32:15,290 --> 00:32:17,130
Speaker 0: It shouldn't be that hard with what they've already got.

441
00:32:17,350 --> 00:32:20,150
Speaker 1: Discord, need a product manager, hire me, I'll make it done, I'll make it happen.

442
00:32:22,951 --> 00:32:29,890
Speaker 0: Alright, anyway, let's get into the review, because Emily saw this movie- Let me give you some background, let me give you some background info here.

443
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:42,047
Speaker 1: Oh, because I have some background background info, Emily saw this movie some time ago because of an Academy screening that she was- I got more, even farther background info on this, going back to like, you know, 15 years ago.

444
00:32:43,290 --> 00:32:49,050
Speaker 1: This was one of those screenings where I couldn't even go, like I couldn't even ride on her coattails to go to this one, that's how locked down it was.

445
00:32:49,611 --> 00:32:53,309
Speaker 1: So, she comes back and she's like, "This movie's amazing, you've got to see it, oh wait, you

446
00:32:53,349 --> 00:32:53,550
Speaker 1: can't.".

447
00:32:54,451 --> 00:32:54,651
Speaker 0: Right.

448
00:32:54,972 --> 00:33:09,510
Speaker 0: So, back in mid-2000s, when Geek Nights was early, I guess later 2000s, we were going to mocha festivals, and mocha festivals were still in, like, you know, the armory, or even the puck building, right?

449
00:33:10,351 --> 00:33:11,955
Speaker 0: One of the booths that I always saw.

450
00:33:12,015 --> 00:33:17,389
Speaker 0: there was a publisher, Fanfare, slash, I'm going to pronounce this wrong, I'm sorry, Ponemon?

451
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,172
Speaker 0: I guess it's French, right?

452
00:33:20,455 --> 00:33:24,864
Speaker 0: And they publish many, you know, they're really, at least in the

453
00:33:24,944 --> 00:33:25,345
Speaker 0: U.S.,

454
00:33:25,405 --> 00:33:27,449
Speaker 0: it's a very small publisher in the

455
00:33:27,589 --> 00:33:27,850
Speaker 0: U.S.,

456
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:32,881
Speaker 0: sorry, importing, you know, various works, translating them and whatnot, right?

457
00:33:32,901 --> 00:33:37,130
Speaker 0: Like, really boutique graphic novel selection here, right?

458
00:33:37,530 --> 00:33:44,642
Speaker 0: And one of the things that they did is they had, I believe they still have, like, the U.S.

459
00:33:44,782 --> 00:33:49,430
Speaker 0: exclusive license for distributing the works of Jiro Taniguchi, right?

460
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,193
Speaker 0: If it's a Jiro Taniguchi manga in the

461
00:33:51,293 --> 00:33:51,594
Speaker 0: U.S.,

462
00:33:51,974 --> 00:33:52,695
Speaker 0: they publish it.

463
00:33:53,998 --> 00:34:01,470
Speaker 0: And I had a, you know, very "I recognize your face" relationship with the guy who would always work at that booth.

464
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:12,590
Speaker 1: That is, I can't remember the names of half the game publishers I talked to at PAX's or whatever, but I remember exactly what they look like when they're standing behind their own booths.

465
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:20,641
Speaker 0: Yep, and so one of the works that I noticed at that booth, I think one of the last, you know, was Summit of the Gods, right?

466
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:25,090
Speaker 0: Which is, I believe, it's five or six volumes in total.

467
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:30,958
Speaker 0: I don't know if all of them are out, but I knew, that's how I knew it existed.

468
00:34:31,018 --> 00:34:39,010
Speaker 0: I knew that this was a manga about mountain climbing from Jiro Taniguchi that was available in whole or in part in English.

469
00:34:39,610 --> 00:34:44,362
Speaker 0: And that it was, like, you know, legendary and great, and I hadn't read it, and I still haven't read it.

470
00:34:44,623 --> 00:34:47,050
Speaker 0: But I have read other Jiro Taniguchi works.

471
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:50,723
Speaker 0: So, Jiro Taniguchi, I think, passed away, like, a few years ago.

472
00:34:50,743 --> 00:34:52,248
Speaker 0: It might have been news on this show.

473
00:34:53,391 --> 00:35:03,190
Speaker 0: But if you don't know, Jiro Taniguchi is this manga/gekiga creator who is in, sort of, this unique space on his own.

474
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:11,490
Speaker 0: And that, first of all, it seems to me, like, the impression that I've always gotten is that France loves him way more than Japan does.

475
00:35:13,471 --> 00:35:17,770
Speaker 0: That's just, like, this impression that I've gotten because his works just seem to be huge in France.

476
00:35:17,931 --> 00:35:22,950
Speaker 1: Also, like, another one of his comics was adapted into a live-action Belgian movie.

477
00:35:23,791 --> 00:35:24,653
Speaker 0: Yeah.

478
00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:29,084
Speaker 0: In fact, the most recent book of his that I bought and own is The Guardians of the Louvre.

479
00:35:29,104 --> 00:35:31,290
Speaker 0: There's a series of graphic novels.

480
00:35:31,733 --> 00:35:32,989
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, you were talking about that.

481
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:45,149
Speaker 0: Right, there's a whole series that the Louvre commissioned, right, from various graphic novel creators around the world to each draw, to each create an individual comic that involved the Louvre.

482
00:35:45,992 --> 00:35:48,820
Speaker 0: You know, so I got one from the JoJo creator, right?

483
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,545
Speaker 0: Urasawa's got one, right?

484
00:35:50,605 --> 00:35:52,070
Speaker 0: I got the Jiro Taniguchi one.

485
00:35:53,450 --> 00:36:13,650
Speaker 0: And so what Jiro Taniguchi does is, sort of, unique in the manga space, at least in terms of mangas that are accessible to the US market, is that his works generally don't involve sci-fi, fantasy, magic, anything unrealistic at all, right?

486
00:36:14,271 --> 00:36:18,598
Speaker 0: They're almost always some sort of, you know, human drama.

487
00:36:18,618 --> 00:36:25,290
Speaker 0: that is, you know, I don't say, not adult porn adult, but adult and, like, children would be bored out of their minds.

488
00:36:25,410 --> 00:36:29,735
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, the movie we just watched, a child would just be like, "This is just old people on a

489
00:36:29,775 --> 00:36:30,075
Speaker 1: mountain.".

490
00:36:44,551 --> 00:36:47,237
Speaker 0: It's like, here's some people doing a thing, right?

491
00:36:47,678 --> 00:36:52,950
Speaker 0: It's about human emotions and things that can actually happen, could have actually happened, or did actually happen.

492
00:36:54,810 --> 00:37:09,130
Speaker 0: And they're generally all, like, amazing, and it's the artistic style of his that the movie captured very well, even though it wasn't perfect, we'll get to that, artistic-wise, we'll get to that in a second.

493
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:23,530
Speaker 0: But when you look at his character designs, right, they're sort of in that space where it's, like, you can tell that it was, you know, a manga creator who drew those people, right?

494
00:37:24,070 --> 00:37:29,456
Speaker 0: But it's not, like, triangle chin Evangelion Naruto, right?

495
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:44,450
Speaker 0: It's much, you know, and I think that it's much closer to, you know, in this in-between space, right, between, of more, like, a realistic human depiction, but still a simplified manga depiction.

496
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:50,452
Speaker 1: But much like the creator- I mean, you could say the same thing about some of Urasawa's work, like- Sure.

497
00:37:50,492 --> 00:37:54,780
Speaker 0: But Urasawa has, like, that sort of, like, style that's particular to him.

498
00:37:55,161 --> 00:37:57,786
Speaker 0: You can just tell that's an Urasawa face.

499
00:37:57,826 --> 00:37:59,809
Speaker 0: Especially his little eyebrow he'd always draw.

500
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:00,110
Speaker 0: Anyway.

501
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:08,462
Speaker 0: But the backgrounds, much like in Death Note, are, like, just these incredible backgrounds, right?

502
00:38:08,562 --> 00:38:12,650
Speaker 0: That just, like, someone spent way too much time drawing because they had nothing better to do, right?

503
00:38:13,111 --> 00:38:21,548
Speaker 1: No, you're right on the France thing, too, because he actually was knighted as a Chevalier of the order of art and, like, some big order.

504
00:38:21,589 --> 00:38:22,070
Speaker 1: He's a knight.

505
00:38:22,490 --> 00:38:23,730
Speaker 0: Rym's checking out Wikipedia, probably.

506
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:28,750
Speaker 1: You realize I stream my desktop while we're doing Geek Nights, so people can see exactly what I'm looking at.

507
00:38:28,770 --> 00:38:30,134
Speaker 0: Oh, so everyone can see that you're looking at the Wikipedia?

508
00:38:30,154 --> 00:38:30,515
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah.

509
00:38:30,956 --> 00:38:31,537
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

510
00:38:32,159 --> 00:38:36,069
Speaker 0: But, yeah, so that's who Jiro Tanaguchi is, sadly passed away a few years ago.

511
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:38,776
Speaker 0: Legendary, legendary manga creator.

512
00:38:38,856 --> 00:38:42,047
Speaker 0: If you see Jiro Tanaguchi's name on a manga, it's probably good.

513
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:43,030
Speaker 0: You should probably just read it.

514
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:55,690
Speaker 0: So, this movie is an animated 90-minute adaptation of the manga, Summon of the Gods, and it came out very recently, and it's on Netflix, I believe, exclusively in the US.

515
00:38:56,130 --> 00:39:01,663
Speaker 1: Yep, and it only recently appeared on Netflix, like, just, like, you can watch this now, and we couldn't have said that.

516
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:03,467
Speaker 1: I don't know when it actually hit.

517
00:39:04,149 --> 00:39:04,490
Speaker 1: Let's see.

518
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:06,616
Speaker 0: And it's only 90 minutes long-ish, right?

519
00:39:06,636 --> 00:39:08,361
Speaker 0: It's not one of those mega-log movies.

520
00:39:08,441 --> 00:39:09,384
Speaker 0: You can just watch this one real quick.

521
00:39:09,404 --> 00:39:09,885
Speaker 1: Oh, longer than I thought.

522
00:39:09,945 --> 00:39:10,748
Speaker 1: It hit on November 30th.

523
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:15,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's actually, you know, you might think, "Oh, this is an anime

524
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:15,840
Speaker 0: movie.".

525
00:39:15,881 --> 00:39:16,903
Speaker 0: No, it's a French movie.

526
00:39:17,023 --> 00:39:19,630
Speaker 0: It was made by French studio, right?

527
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:21,773
Speaker 0: The original language is French.

528
00:39:21,833 --> 00:39:23,616
Speaker 0: Don't watch Japanese with English subtitles.

529
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:25,198
Speaker 0: Watch French with English subtitles.

530
00:39:25,578 --> 00:39:26,400
Speaker 0: It's in France.

531
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:47,430
Speaker 0: It's in French, even though this is something really interesting that I'm gonna give a lot of credit for, right, is that if this had been made, right, by an English, a US Hollywood animation studio, say Disney, right, they would have made it an American mountain climber, right, speaking English.

532
00:39:48,451 --> 00:39:55,682
Speaker 0: These, a French studio made a movie based on a Japanese manga, and it was a Japanese mount, just like the original manga.

533
00:39:55,702 --> 00:39:56,323
Speaker 0: They didn't change it.

534
00:39:56,343 --> 00:40:00,590
Speaker 0: It was a Japanese mountain climber who was from Japan, right?

535
00:40:00,590 --> 00:40:01,331
Speaker 0: They lived in Japan.

536
00:40:01,351 --> 00:40:10,928
Speaker 0: The original dub language is French just because French voice actors were the original voice cast, but they didn't make it a French story or anything.

537
00:40:10,948 --> 00:40:12,290
Speaker 0: They kept it as it was.

538
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:17,098
Speaker 0: It's a story about a Japanese people, right, who do mountain climbing.

539
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,450
Speaker 0: So, that's A-plus France, not euro-washing, right, at all.

540
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:25,514
Speaker 1: And obviously, this is a review.

541
00:40:25,554 --> 00:40:30,443
Speaker 1: We won't spoil anything, material, because I highly recommend you watch this movie.

542
00:40:30,483 --> 00:40:31,565
Speaker 1: This movie is phenomenal.

543
00:40:32,787 --> 00:40:33,969
Speaker 1: I very much enjoyed it.

544
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:41,961
Speaker 0: Yeah, even spoiling, it's like, even if I told you the whole plot just straight up, it's like, there's nothing in the plot.

545
00:40:42,121 --> 00:40:43,824
Speaker 0: It's not about surprises, right?

546
00:40:43,864 --> 00:40:47,930
Speaker 0: It's like, you basically know as soon as you know what it's about, what's gonna happen, right?

547
00:40:48,672 --> 00:40:49,896
Speaker 0: It's just so obvious.

548
00:40:50,056 --> 00:40:54,930
Speaker 0: It's like, you don't make one of these stories about a mountain climber, right?

549
00:40:55,330 --> 00:40:59,549
Speaker 1: It was Chekhov's "What would you do if your friend was hanging from the

550
00:40:59,570 --> 00:40:59,670
Speaker 1: night?".

551
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,077
Speaker 0: Chekhov's Mountain, and the mountain is on the cover, right?

552
00:41:02,177 --> 00:41:03,622
Speaker 0: It's like, come on people.

553
00:41:04,985 --> 00:41:06,430
Speaker 0: It's not about that, right?

554
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:18,422
Speaker 0: So, basically, the plot structure is sort of this cliché of, it's about a person, but we don't see that person.

555
00:41:18,482 --> 00:41:25,850
Speaker 0: Instead, we see a journalist who's investigating that person, and you get flashbacks as the journalist discovers more information about the person.

556
00:41:26,271 --> 00:41:29,617
Speaker 0: And I said, while I was watching it, I said to myself, "Yeah, that's a

557
00:41:29,677 --> 00:41:30,198
Speaker 0: cliché.".

558
00:41:30,318 --> 00:41:34,105
Speaker 0: And the other half of my brain said, "Oh, it's a cliché?

559
00:41:34,485 --> 00:41:36,609
Speaker 0: Alright, tell me one thing that has that same

560
00:41:36,669 --> 00:41:37,070
Speaker 0: structure.".

561
00:41:37,691 --> 00:41:40,939
Speaker 0: And the other half of my brain went, "Uh...".

562
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,084
Speaker 0: And then it finally said, "Oh, Citizen

563
00:41:43,104 --> 00:41:43,325
Speaker 0: Kane.".

564
00:41:43,525 --> 00:41:45,430
Speaker 1: Citizen Kane is the same structure, right?

565
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:49,947
Speaker 1: You're like orbiting around looking for something recent and forgetting the giant planet.

566
00:41:49,967 --> 00:41:50,630
Speaker 1: that's just right there.

567
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:51,472
Speaker 1: Yeah.

568
00:41:51,652 --> 00:41:57,645
Speaker 0: Citizen Kane is, you know, it's a journalist who's trying to investigate what the hell was up with Rosebud or whatever, right?

569
00:41:57,665 --> 00:41:59,970
Speaker 0: And it flashbacks to show you Citizen Kane's life.

570
00:42:00,070 --> 00:42:02,976
Speaker 0: So, the first half of the movie is basically that.

571
00:42:03,056 --> 00:42:10,350
Speaker 0: The journalist investigating the dude, and then the second half of the movie, I don't know if it's the half, maybe final third, right?

572
00:42:11,272 --> 00:42:18,926
Speaker 0: Is sort of separate in that it's sort of a different act in which, okay, you found the dude or whatever, right?

573
00:42:19,327 --> 00:42:20,910
Speaker 0: And now, mountain climbing.

574
00:42:22,350 --> 00:42:26,270
Speaker 0: And then that's, I guess, the climax of the movie.

575
00:42:26,850 --> 00:42:31,899
Speaker 1: It's a very thoughtful ending that wraps up all of the themes.

576
00:42:31,999 --> 00:42:38,110
Speaker 1: Every theme that is presented in the movie is wrapped up very neatly and very provocatively.

577
00:42:38,231 --> 00:42:40,086
Speaker 1: Just the way it ends and how it ends.

578
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:53,489
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, the core point of the movie is real, and I guess presumably the manga that I still probably should read, but haven't, is pretty much like, "Why the hell would you go mountain

579
00:42:53,509 --> 00:42:53,889
Speaker 0: climbing?".

580
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:59,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's a little more nuanced than that because without spoiling things, look what happens to this character.

581
00:42:59,764 --> 00:43:02,250
Speaker 1: On one hand, the mountain climber character, not the journalist.

582
00:43:02,790 --> 00:43:09,676
Speaker 1: The mountain climber is clearly driven and definitely has that sort of, "Everyone around me is not as good as me.

583
00:43:09,836 --> 00:43:12,198
Speaker 1: Even if they're my friends, I could do better by myself.

584
00:43:12,418 --> 00:43:14,160
Speaker 1: No one is on my level to climb with

585
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:14,300
Speaker 1: me.".

586
00:43:15,630 --> 00:43:22,318
Speaker 1: Simultaneously, he's, you know, thinking back to Master Keaton, and I'm not a master versus a professional.

587
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:31,890
Speaker 1: He's basically a professional here in that he is seeking the absolute extremes of skill to the point that he can really only rely on himself.

588
00:43:32,471 --> 00:43:39,050
Speaker 1: And simultaneously, due to the tragic incident that occurs when he breaks the sort of rule he's made for himself.

589
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:39,890
Speaker 0: Many tragic incidents.

590
00:43:40,190 --> 00:43:46,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, but one in particular sets the stage for him to be very internally justified in climbing by himself.

591
00:43:47,017 --> 00:43:58,790
Speaker 1: Like, he almost recognizes that, one, no one is on my level, and two, anyone who tries to be on my level, I am putting them at extreme risk to the point that for the safety of others, I climb by myself.

592
00:44:00,232 --> 00:44:08,662
Speaker 0: Alright, but basically it takes that question of why would you go mountain climbing, but applies it then, you know, to just all of, you know, human life, right?

593
00:44:08,702 --> 00:44:13,127
Speaker 0: Like, why would anyone do anything like mountain climbing?

594
00:44:13,387 --> 00:44:15,770
Speaker 0: Why would you be driven to do anything, period?

595
00:44:16,212 --> 00:44:16,370
Speaker 0: Yep.

596
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:16,850
Speaker 0: Right?

597
00:44:17,251 --> 00:44:26,150
Speaker 0: And you just, mountain climbing is just used as a lens to examine your own goals and your own drives, you know, through it.

598
00:44:26,311 --> 00:44:28,130
Speaker 0: And also, ask yourself that same question.

599
00:44:28,330 --> 00:44:29,190
Speaker 1: What is mountain climbing?

600
00:44:29,590 --> 00:44:30,722
Speaker 0: What would make you do 2000 podcasts?

601
00:44:31,930 --> 00:44:46,490
Speaker 1: But it's a spectrum too, because look at, in the very beginning, there's that, you know, the gang of friends are all mountain climbers together, and he's complaining like, oh, like they always turn back, they start late, they turn back, like they don't succeed at most of their climbs.

602
00:44:46,911 --> 00:44:57,710
Speaker 1: But they're also mountain climbers, they're also like super skilled, but they're enjoying themselves, and they're not after the same thing he's after, even though they're doing the exact same activity.

603
00:44:59,130 --> 00:45:02,066
Speaker 1: Which is a topic we talk about on Geek Nights a lot.

604
00:45:03,230 --> 00:45:09,970
Speaker 0: People who have the same hobby, the same interest, but enjoy it for different reasons and different ways, and don't get along as a result.

605
00:45:10,552 --> 00:45:14,524
Speaker 0: Actually don't have much in common, even though you think they might, because they're both mountain climbers.

606
00:45:14,604 --> 00:45:16,390
Speaker 0: But actually, no, there couldn't be more different.

607
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:23,690
Speaker 1: But it's also framed in this, because, you know, there's the other guy he's competing with who dies, because a lot of mountain climbers die trying to do this stuff.

608
00:45:24,070 --> 00:45:28,230
Speaker 1: The sort of meta framing, because this is not set in modern day, is that...

609
00:45:28,310 --> 00:45:35,410
Speaker 0: No, this is set, it's set in like, I think the late 90s, because you can tell by the laptop the journalist has, still has a three and a half inch floppy hole on it.

610
00:45:35,890 --> 00:45:35,960
Speaker 1: Yep.

611
00:45:36,211 --> 00:45:38,169
Speaker 1: All film cameras, like cell phones.

612
00:45:38,270 --> 00:45:46,008
Speaker 0: And digital cameras came around like 2000, it was early 2000s, he probably would have moved up to a digital camera, like 2003 or something.

613
00:45:47,031 --> 00:45:51,130
Speaker 0: So it's got to be late 90s, based on the technology shown.

614
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:54,450
Speaker 1: But also based on the backdrop of what is happening in mountain climbing.

615
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:58,522
Speaker 1: Because there is the simpler story of why do people do, like.

616
00:45:58,562 --> 00:46:01,010
Speaker 1: that's a very common trope in this kind of story.

617
00:46:01,611 --> 00:46:11,350
Speaker 1: But there's a broader point around the sort of increasing search for the extreme to do something new or different or push a boundary specifically.

618
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:15,970
Speaker 1: Because it talks a lot about how at first it was, can you climb something?

619
00:46:16,472 --> 00:46:17,950
Speaker 1: And then people started climbing things.

620
00:46:18,211 --> 00:46:22,610
Speaker 1: And then it started to edge into, oh, climb increasingly dangerous things.

621
00:46:22,951 --> 00:46:27,310
Speaker 1: And then, all right, let's climb things we've already climbed, but make it artificially dangerous.

622
00:46:27,672 --> 00:46:28,898
Speaker 1: I'll do it without oxygen.

623
00:46:29,179 --> 00:46:30,304
Speaker 1: I'll do it without support.

624
00:46:30,606 --> 00:46:31,430
Speaker 1: I'll do it blind.

625
00:46:32,832 --> 00:46:43,990
Speaker 1: Like there's this race among the professionals of increasing risk and increasing danger that they're putting onto themselves because of the goal that they're seeking, which is arguably unattainable.

626
00:46:45,392 --> 00:46:46,015
Speaker 0: Yep.

627
00:46:46,035 --> 00:46:48,810
Speaker 0: I guess you can go to Mars and climb Olympus Mons instead, right?

628
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:49,178
Speaker 0: Yup.

629
00:46:50,612 --> 00:46:51,345
Speaker 0: That'll get you.

630
00:46:51,911 --> 00:46:57,290
Speaker 1: But you can almost see that this is arguably a toxic aspect.

631
00:46:57,711 --> 00:47:06,650
Speaker 1: Of things like mountain biking, mountain climbing, skiing, extreme sports, in that there is a culture of pushing those limits to the extreme.

632
00:47:07,230 --> 00:47:16,390
Speaker 1: When for many people, like all the people who failed to summit in the very beginning and gave up when the storm came through, like reasonable people, they're still enjoying the sport.

633
00:47:16,530 --> 00:47:24,630
Speaker 1: They're still supreme experts, but they got to the point where they can do the extreme quadruple black dangerous nonsense, but they choose not to.

634
00:47:24,951 --> 00:47:28,948
Speaker 1: They use that skill to do something slightly less dangerous and have more fun doing it.

635
00:47:30,711 --> 00:47:41,070
Speaker 0: So yeah, so this movie, right, it's interesting because it still has some of the aspects of like an initial D, right?

636
00:47:41,591 --> 00:47:44,570
Speaker 0: Like a lower brow sports manga, right?

637
00:47:45,011 --> 00:47:49,319
Speaker 0: Because it gets really whoever did the research on this, right?

638
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,010
Speaker 0: It's so technically correct with regards to the every little detail about the methods.

639
00:47:55,831 --> 00:48:01,790
Speaker 0: And, you know, when they're actually climbing the mountains, like, you know, it's like not even you.

640
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:08,487
Speaker 0: I don't know that much about mountain climbing, but you don't have to know that much to see that what they're doing is.

641
00:48:08,688 --> 00:48:09,510
Speaker 0: that's the way it's done.

642
00:48:09,992 --> 00:48:14,050
Speaker 1: Like they're doing that, like laying the leads and the safety ropes, like accurately the tying.

643
00:48:14,772 --> 00:48:17,130
Speaker 0: Someone drew them tying knots the correct way.

644
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,875
Speaker 1: Or the accident with the kid.

645
00:48:20,175 --> 00:48:26,850
Speaker 1: When that happens, you can see behind him the exact thing that causes the incident.

646
00:48:27,830 --> 00:48:31,670
Speaker 1: The rope is like slightly curled around this tiny little piece of rock that's sticking up.

647
00:48:32,490 --> 00:48:32,691
Speaker 0: Yep.

648
00:48:33,933 --> 00:48:42,730
Speaker 0: So yeah, so that's a good, you know, you can learn, I guess, you know, if this encourages you to do mountain climbing, I would hope that you would stick to low level.

649
00:48:43,655 --> 00:48:44,226
Speaker 1: Or level up.

650
00:48:45,473 --> 00:48:47,529
Speaker 1: Start at your local indoor climbing gym.

651
00:48:48,370 --> 00:48:58,990
Speaker 1: Because the one thing that was bothering me and that I wasn't sure how this movie was going to end was the idea that he's going to do the climb he does in the end of the movie without oxygen.

652
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:05,969
Speaker 1: And of course the journalist is going to follow him, but there is no way that journalist is capable of doing what he's about to do.

653
00:49:06,570 --> 00:49:11,969
Speaker 1: So the whole time you're like the tension for the audience is, you know, there's no way he can make it.

654
00:49:12,291 --> 00:49:14,329
Speaker 1: So how is this possibly going to end?

655
00:49:15,250 --> 00:49:15,451
Speaker 0: Right.

656
00:49:15,531 --> 00:49:22,950
Speaker 0: So that is something I think that this particular story brings attention to that not many other stories I've seen do.

657
00:49:23,110 --> 00:49:23,251
Speaker 0: Right.

658
00:49:23,271 --> 00:49:32,230
Speaker 0: The only other ones I think that come close are stories I've seen about like war photography where it's like if you're a photographer, it's like, yeah, you can get a big zoom lens.

659
00:49:32,611 --> 00:49:32,953
Speaker 0: Right.

660
00:49:33,234 --> 00:49:36,130
Speaker 0: To shoot, you know, animals or whatever from far away.

661
00:49:36,270 --> 00:49:46,830
Speaker 0: But for the most part, if you're a professional photographer, certain subject matter requires you to not just be a photographer, but to also be something else.

662
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:47,252
Speaker 0: Right.

663
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:50,850
Speaker 0: It's like you can't be a mountain climbing photographer if you're not a mountain climber.

664
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:54,030
Speaker 0: You can't be a skydiving photographer if you're not also a great skydiver.

665
00:49:54,530 --> 00:50:01,830
Speaker 1: All those photos we have of like big sea battles in World War Two, people in planes were flying through a dogfight, like taking those photos.

666
00:50:02,750 --> 00:50:02,931
Speaker 0: Right.

667
00:50:02,971 --> 00:50:05,201
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, some aerial photography.

668
00:50:05,241 --> 00:50:07,350
Speaker 0: these days, you can get someone else to fly the helicopter.

669
00:50:07,750 --> 00:50:09,941
Speaker 1: Drones have changed that to a significant degree.

670
00:50:10,223 --> 00:50:11,570
Speaker 1: Like you can have a drone just follow you.

671
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:14,270
Speaker 0: Well, you still need to be a drone pilot, which takes some skill.

672
00:50:14,972 --> 00:50:16,300
Speaker 1: Oh, there are completely automated there.

673
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:17,226
Speaker 1: So there's a cool set.

674
00:50:17,326 --> 00:50:17,910
Speaker 1: There's a drone.

675
00:50:17,930 --> 00:50:19,987
Speaker 0: There are automated ones, but there's a drone I want.

676
00:50:20,753 --> 00:50:23,749
Speaker 1: But it is illegal to use pretty much anywhere I will ever ski.

677
00:50:24,293 --> 00:50:25,330
Speaker 0: People just do it anyway.

678
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:26,275
Speaker 1: No.

679
00:50:26,396 --> 00:50:27,810
Speaker 1: At ski mountains, you get shot down.

680
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:28,535
Speaker 0: Oh, not at ski.

681
00:50:28,555 --> 00:50:30,769
Speaker 0: In the city, people just do it anyway, even though it's illegal.

682
00:50:31,110 --> 00:50:37,390
Speaker 1: These are drones that you put up and they will just follow you on a program automatically without you doing anything, beginning to end.

683
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:38,592
Speaker 0: Yeah.

684
00:50:38,713 --> 00:50:39,655
Speaker 0: But, you know, it's not.

685
00:50:39,775 --> 00:50:45,150
Speaker 0: sometimes you want to get a fancy shot and the automatic shot is not, you know, just like autofocuses might not get the shot you want.

686
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:55,810
Speaker 1: And the movie really makes a point of highlighting that, but it doesn't at any point address up until the final scene, wait, so how is this going to work when he follows this guy?

687
00:50:56,310 --> 00:51:01,010
Speaker 1: But it really points out that Mallory carrying that camera to prove that they did it.

688
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:03,194
Speaker 1: Even the Sherpa is like, he needs you.

689
00:51:03,515 --> 00:51:11,090
Speaker 1: Otherwise, there won't be any proof that he did it, which I think is very subtle because the Sherpa knows exactly how this whole situation is going to go down.

690
00:51:11,490 --> 00:51:13,893
Speaker 0: So there's, it, it, it serves three purposes, right?

691
00:51:13,913 --> 00:51:27,410
Speaker 0: So one, it, it gives you some focus on like, yeah, the photographers and journalists of the world who are covering subject matter that requires themselves to be there are not getting the credit of the, of their subjects.

692
00:51:27,813 --> 00:51:28,014
Speaker 0: Right.

693
00:51:28,175 --> 00:51:30,149
Speaker 0: Even though they're pretty much right there next to them.

694
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:30,711
Speaker 0: Right.

695
00:51:31,231 --> 00:51:33,153
Speaker 0: A lot of the time in some cases, right.

696
00:51:33,274 --> 00:51:36,678
Speaker 0: Mountain climbing in particular, uh, be right.

697
00:51:37,138 --> 00:51:46,810
Speaker 0: It gives you a way you can now see how amazing the one person is because they've put a very expert person next to them to give you that contrast, right?

698
00:51:47,011 --> 00:51:53,710
Speaker 0: If they just show you a person climbing by themselves as someone without knowledge of climbing, you can't really tell how great they're doing.

699
00:51:53,971 --> 00:51:58,242
Speaker 0: But I love someone next to them and you can see how much better they are than the other person.

700
00:51:58,563 --> 00:52:00,810
Speaker 0: And now you can understand what's going on.

701
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:06,277
Speaker 1: I love how beautifully that is portrayed because that final act is basically the journalist.

702
00:52:06,498 --> 00:52:08,360
Speaker 1: You don't see the professional climbing.

703
00:52:08,741 --> 00:52:15,250
Speaker 1: You see the journalist climbing and he's following the tracks and there's a lot of environmental storytelling along the way.

704
00:52:15,571 --> 00:52:18,998
Speaker 1: Like he gets to that ravine and you didn't see the professional do it.

705
00:52:19,519 --> 00:52:24,270
Speaker 1: You see the journalists like figure out and like plan to do it himself.

706
00:52:25,210 --> 00:52:28,943
Speaker 1: And the tension is you don't actually know exactly how the professional did it.

707
00:52:28,963 --> 00:52:30,770
Speaker 1: The professional is already like miles ahead on the trail.

708
00:52:31,951 --> 00:52:32,091
Speaker 0: Yep.

709
00:52:32,112 --> 00:52:36,670
Speaker 0: Well, in fact, the first part of the movie is also the journalist following the person, right?

710
00:52:36,810 --> 00:52:38,290
Speaker 1: But you see there he's taking a parallel.

711
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:41,070
Speaker 0: Once he finds him, he physically follows him afterwards.

712
00:52:44,970 --> 00:52:58,748
Speaker 0: So, yeah, it's, you know, this movie, I think, you know, it doesn't make me want to do mountain climbing, although I recognize how amazing it would feel to be like at the top of a mountain and then to think I got all the way the fuck up here with nothing but my

713
00:52:58,848 --> 00:52:59,028
Speaker 1: own

714
00:52:59,488 --> 00:53:00,630
Speaker 0: body and some sticks.

715
00:53:02,258 --> 00:53:04,430
Speaker 1: If you want to try mountain climbing without like...

716
00:53:04,430 --> 00:53:05,298
Speaker 0: No, I have no idea.

717
00:53:05,318 --> 00:53:06,429
Speaker 0: I have no interest in that.

718
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:09,642
Speaker 1: I have summited gothics like it.

719
00:53:09,702 --> 00:53:11,369
Speaker 1: That is achievable by someone like you.

720
00:53:12,370 --> 00:53:14,349
Speaker 0: But you know what it did make me want to do?

721
00:53:14,890 --> 00:53:14,983
Speaker 0: What?

722
00:53:15,991 --> 00:53:20,870
Speaker 0: It makes me want to go on like a plane to the bottom of the mountain.

723
00:53:22,474 --> 00:53:23,558
Speaker 0: I don't want to go up the mountain.

724
00:53:24,101 --> 00:53:26,250
Speaker 0: I just want to go to the bottom of the mountain.

725
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,030
Speaker 1: You can do glacier hiking to see those vistas without having to go up.

726
00:53:30,271 --> 00:53:30,431
Speaker 0: Right.

727
00:53:30,471 --> 00:53:36,790
Speaker 0: I could just like fly to where Mount Everest is and just like stay at Camp One, you know, like not climb anywhere.

728
00:53:37,010 --> 00:53:37,837
Speaker 0: Camp Zero, whatever.

729
00:53:37,917 --> 00:53:38,704
Speaker 0: Just stay at the airport.

730
00:53:38,724 --> 00:53:39,450
Speaker 0: Right.

731
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:42,467
Speaker 0: You know, see, you know, I could take this stuff there.

732
00:53:42,487 --> 00:53:42,890
Speaker 0: Right.

733
00:53:43,010 --> 00:53:43,842
Speaker 0: You know, see people.

734
00:53:43,862 --> 00:53:44,409
Speaker 0: Right.

735
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:47,450
Speaker 0: See the people are climbing, you know, look up at a sky.

736
00:53:47,650 --> 00:53:48,450
Speaker 1: It's not on that scale.

737
00:53:48,891 --> 00:54:00,350
Speaker 1: I've summited six of the high peaks in the Adirondacks and that is it is quite an experience to get up onto like the actual top top summit and look around you and see what it looks like from such a high vantage point.

738
00:54:00,730 --> 00:54:01,052
Speaker 0: I'll go.

739
00:54:01,173 --> 00:54:04,250
Speaker 0: I'll go up any mountain that can be climbed via bicycle.

740
00:54:05,573 --> 00:54:07,309
Speaker 1: You could bike up Gothic if you're insane.

741
00:54:08,030 --> 00:54:08,569
Speaker 0: Does it have a road?

742
00:54:08,950 --> 00:54:09,092
Speaker 1: No.

743
00:54:09,113 --> 00:54:10,190
Speaker 1: Mountain bike.

744
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:11,470
Speaker 0: That doesn't count, does it?

745
00:54:11,791 --> 00:54:12,936
Speaker 1: You could bike up Whiteface.

746
00:54:13,841 --> 00:54:15,026
Speaker 1: Whiteface has a road to the top.

747
00:54:15,066 --> 00:54:15,870
Speaker 1: It's in the Adirondacks.

748
00:54:16,870 --> 00:54:17,428
Speaker 0: How high is it?

749
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:18,278
Speaker 0: Very high.

750
00:54:18,298 --> 00:54:19,550
Speaker 1: It's one of the high peaks in the Adirondacks.

751
00:54:19,570 --> 00:54:20,107
Speaker 0: How many feet?

752
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:21,417
Speaker 1: Let me pull it up right now.

753
00:54:21,963 --> 00:54:22,590
Speaker 1: Whiteface.

754
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:26,649
Speaker 1: Because that was the most boring mountain I've ever climbed up there, to be honest.

755
00:54:30,111 --> 00:54:31,642
Speaker 1: Whiteface, how tall are you?

756
00:54:31,662 --> 00:54:31,904
Speaker 1: About a mile.

757
00:54:33,832 --> 00:54:33,983
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

758
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:36,273
Speaker 1: The top elevation is about 5,000 feet.

759
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:42,800
Speaker 0: Oh, OK.

760
00:54:42,841 --> 00:54:43,290
Speaker 0: That's fine.

761
00:54:43,894 --> 00:54:45,566
Speaker 1: The prominence of it over the land is about 3,000 feet.

762
00:54:46,430 --> 00:54:48,729
Speaker 1: It's a relatively easy hike to the top.

763
00:54:49,914 --> 00:54:51,249
Speaker 0: If there's a road, I could bike up that.

764
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:52,028
Speaker 0: There is a road.

765
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:53,210
Speaker 1: I don't know if people bike it.

766
00:54:53,432 --> 00:54:54,140
Speaker 0: I just go slow.

767
00:54:54,181 --> 00:54:54,969
Speaker 0: I go weeka weeka weeka.

768
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,170
Speaker 1: Biking up Whiteface.

769
00:54:56,911 --> 00:54:57,195
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

770
00:54:57,215 --> 00:54:58,288
Speaker 1: It seems like it's a thing people do.

771
00:54:58,650 --> 00:54:59,610
Speaker 1: Cycling Whiteface Mountain.

772
00:55:01,591 --> 00:55:01,672
Speaker 1: High.

773
00:55:02,375 --> 00:55:03,057
Speaker 1: It's not even.

774
00:55:03,077 --> 00:55:03,921
Speaker 1: You'll do a 3,500 foot elevation gain.

775
00:55:07,052 --> 00:55:07,595
Speaker 1: Eight miles.

776
00:55:07,736 --> 00:55:11,695
Speaker 1: Average gradient 8.4%.

777
00:55:11,695 --> 00:55:12,670
Speaker 1: It's not that bad, actually.

778
00:55:12,893 --> 00:55:13,785
Speaker 0: I'll go weeka weeka weeka.

779
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:15,850
Speaker 1: That's such a long route, though.

780
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:19,010
Speaker 1: When I climbed this thing, I basically just went straight up that steep side there.

781
00:55:19,370 --> 00:55:21,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, the road probably goes like a spiral or a back and forth.

782
00:55:21,650 --> 00:55:25,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, the road goes like way up and around this really easy gradient compared to what I climbed.

783
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:27,881
Speaker 1: Anyway.

784
00:55:29,112 --> 00:55:32,370
Speaker 1: So, two other things that I noted about this movie that I really liked.

785
00:55:33,071 --> 00:55:34,630
Speaker 1: Because I have very few complaints about it.

786
00:55:34,690 --> 00:55:36,489
Speaker 1: Just one observation of something they messed up.

787
00:55:36,711 --> 00:55:38,290
Speaker 0: Oh, I'll get to my complaint with the words.

788
00:55:38,350 --> 00:55:46,390
Speaker 1: The complaint, and when Emily saw it, the first thing she said, and it was so obvious when you see the movie, is all the characters emote like French people and not like Japanese people.

789
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:51,845
Speaker 1: There's a lot of hand gesticulation and the way people are talking.

790
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:53,250
Speaker 1: It really stands out.

791
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:54,338
Speaker 0: Yep.

792
00:55:54,463 --> 00:55:54,650
Speaker 0: True.

793
00:55:55,370 --> 00:56:08,090
Speaker 1: But what I like is that the movie did not make a judgment or a moral pronouncement about whether or not people should do the various things that are shown in the movie.

794
00:56:08,551 --> 00:56:14,829
Speaker 1: It's very much a, "We're just exploring why people do this and we're showing what they do without

795
00:56:14,850 --> 00:56:15,010
Speaker 1: judgment.".

796
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:17,029
Speaker 0: Show it how it is and then that's it.

797
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:17,793
Speaker 1: It wasn't like.

798
00:56:17,813 --> 00:56:19,162
Speaker 1: the end of the movie was, "See?

799
00:56:19,182 --> 00:56:19,887
Speaker 1: That's what

800
00:56:19,947 --> 00:56:20,330
Speaker 1: happens.".

801
00:56:20,471 --> 00:56:23,245
Speaker 1: It was more like, "Let's explore why this

802
00:56:23,286 --> 00:56:23,668
Speaker 1: happens.".

803
00:56:25,250 --> 00:56:32,970
Speaker 1: And I also like that, just like you talked about the photographers, like that aspect, it also really shows off subtly.

804
00:56:33,530 --> 00:56:44,990
Speaker 1: The other thing about big mountain climbing, like Everest is a big example, the white people who make a big deal about climbing it get a lot of support from Sherpas who have been climbing around on that mountain for a long, long time.

805
00:56:45,530 --> 00:56:48,069
Speaker 1: Sherpas are hauling all their gear up for them.

806
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:55,990
Speaker 1: The Sherpa in the movie has extreme knowledge, it's almost like he has foresight about how this is going to go down as a result.

807
00:56:56,730 --> 00:57:02,102
Speaker 0: I do think that, from what I've read about Everest specifically, I was also sort of disappointed.

808
00:57:02,123 --> 00:57:05,009
Speaker 0: the movie was about Everest because it's so overplayed, but it's fine.

809
00:57:05,531 --> 00:57:07,316
Speaker 1: It was less overplayed then.

810
00:57:07,437 --> 00:57:11,730
Speaker 1: That was like the beginning of the era of it becoming a tourist destination, basically.

811
00:57:11,890 --> 00:57:13,409
Speaker 0: Well, but not when the manga was written.

812
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:21,549
Speaker 0: But regardless, from what I've read about Everest is that when you go to it now, it's almost like tourist attraction, right?

813
00:57:21,970 --> 00:57:30,570
Speaker 0: And it's like this manga doesn't show that aspect of it, but partially they get away with it because he's climbing the other side, the not tourist side.

814
00:57:31,872 --> 00:57:36,068
Speaker 0: So it's like, "Okay, I guess it's okay not to show the tourists because they're not in the spot where the tourists

815
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:36,289
Speaker 0: are.".

816
00:57:37,150 --> 00:57:49,790
Speaker 0: But anyway, so the thing that bothered me is that, art-wise, the character designs seem to be taken straight from the manga, really excellent.

817
00:57:50,150 --> 00:57:55,525
Speaker 0: Obviously everything was computer animated, you can just tell, but still pretty good.

818
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:57,150
Speaker 0: It's not something to complain about.

819
00:57:57,170 --> 00:57:59,435
Speaker 0: It's not like they did it in a bad, offensive way.

820
00:57:59,455 --> 00:58:06,290
Speaker 0: And the backgrounds were always usually incredible, just to look at, which is kind of important.

821
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:09,156
Speaker 1: The soundscape was extremely good, too.

822
00:58:09,216 --> 00:58:11,943
Speaker 1: It really set the mood with all those establishing shots.

823
00:58:12,304 --> 00:58:14,590
Speaker 1: Tidy character, giant mountain in the background.

824
00:58:16,052 --> 00:58:30,450
Speaker 0: And in scenes where things were animated, they were animated well, but the one thing that was noticeable is how much they cut back on, which is something that happens a lot in anime in general since the times of Astro Boy, obviously.

825
00:58:31,310 --> 00:58:41,870
Speaker 0: But for a 90 minute movie, there are a lot of times you could just tell they cut way back on the number of drawings in parts where it didn't count.

826
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:43,813
Speaker 0: A lot.

827
00:58:43,873 --> 00:58:49,642
Speaker 0: There was a scene of a crowd of people on a street and they were just sort of two framing up and down.

828
00:58:49,702 --> 00:58:54,810
Speaker 0: It was like a little guy in the corner running one time.

829
00:58:56,311 --> 00:58:59,096
Speaker 0: It looked like a little flip book.

830
00:58:59,517 --> 00:59:06,270
Speaker 0: A lot of the inconsequential aspects were basically not moving.

831
00:59:06,350 --> 00:59:09,819
Speaker 0: There were some scenes I saw where they took advantage of the computer.

832
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:14,130
Speaker 0: There was a montage where half of the montage was still frames.

833
00:59:15,891 --> 00:59:21,321
Speaker 0: And in the computer, they moved around the digital light source in a clever way.

834
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:26,370
Speaker 0: I think there was a guy, he was standing over a highway holding a glass bottle.

835
00:59:27,171 --> 00:59:29,610
Speaker 1: Oh, that was a really good scene, I thought.

836
00:59:29,690 --> 00:59:29,831
Speaker 1: Right.

837
00:59:29,851 --> 00:59:34,770
Speaker 0: So the cars were going underneath and they were shining through the bottle, which is a really cool effect.

838
00:59:35,391 --> 00:59:44,050
Speaker 0: But what was actually being animated was he was just sitting completely still and they were just moving the digital light on his face every time a headlight went past.

839
00:59:44,651 --> 00:59:44,931
Speaker 0: Right.

840
00:59:45,353 --> 00:59:51,590
Speaker 0: And it's like that's a really big effect for a very cheap technique wise.

841
00:59:51,710 --> 00:59:54,190
Speaker 0: So it's really good economy of animation.

842
00:59:54,190 --> 00:59:57,076
Speaker 1: Well, it was also a very striking scene that you could visualize.

843
00:59:57,116 --> 00:59:58,098
Speaker 1: You could see that happening.

844
00:59:58,158 --> 01:00:04,450
Speaker 1: That's the kind of scene you could see in real life of someone standing there and every car goes by and they're like, you see their face for just a second.

845
01:00:04,610 --> 01:00:04,751
Speaker 0: Right.

846
01:00:04,771 --> 01:00:08,610
Speaker 0: So that's an example of being economical with animation, but still getting a big effect.

847
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:22,230
Speaker 0: But a lot of other scenes that weren't, you know, that if it wasn't like the signature action of like, you know, the main part of the scene, background characters, any stuff like that was economically animated.

848
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:30,270
Speaker 0: Perhaps too much for when I when I watch a movie, when it's only 90 minutes, I guess I have a higher expectation.

849
01:00:30,771 --> 01:00:31,132
Speaker 0: Right.

850
01:00:31,413 --> 01:00:35,390
Speaker 0: To not see that sort of, you know, lower budget kind of stuff going on.

851
01:00:35,691 --> 01:00:35,912
Speaker 0: Right.

852
01:00:36,293 --> 01:00:40,409
Speaker 0: The other thing you won't see, like I haven't still haven't seen Belle, but I guarantee you.

853
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:41,231
Speaker 0: Right.

854
01:00:41,271 --> 01:00:48,970
Speaker 0: That like just some background person is going to just be animated fantastically based on the handful of reviews I've skimmed about Belle.

855
01:00:49,611 --> 01:00:53,810
Speaker 1: People are like, I cannot believe that it is as good as people are implying.

856
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:55,651
Speaker 0: Yeah.

857
01:00:56,192 --> 01:00:57,837
Speaker 0: But I guess, yeah, that's my only.

858
01:00:58,058 --> 01:01:01,128
Speaker 0: the only art complaint is just, you know, animation in the corners.

859
01:01:02,110 --> 01:01:02,411
Speaker 0: Right.

860
01:01:02,531 --> 01:01:14,010
Speaker 1: Like if you take one thing away from the movie, like I like how very subtly but directly it shows that the photographer and Habu are both doing the exact same thing.

861
01:01:15,531 --> 01:01:19,790
Speaker 1: There is no difference between like what they're doing other than extremity.

862
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:25,030
Speaker 1: Like he's trying to like why is he trying to figure out if Mallory hit the top of Everest first or not?

863
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,016
Speaker 1: Like why does he care?

864
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:28,130
Speaker 1: Even his boss doesn't care that much.

865
01:01:29,272 --> 01:01:29,473
Speaker 0: Mm hmm.

866
01:01:30,156 --> 01:01:32,829
Speaker 0: Well, the boss didn't care until he thought there might be money in it.

867
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:33,852
Speaker 1: Yeah.

868
01:01:33,892 --> 01:01:35,396
Speaker 1: Then he cared enough to send it.

869
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:40,910
Speaker 0: But even then, but, you know, the boss is just like, hey, people want to see you take great photos.

870
01:01:41,150 --> 01:01:41,431
Speaker 0: Right.

871
01:01:41,471 --> 01:01:42,494
Speaker 0: People want to see the photos.

872
01:01:42,534 --> 01:01:43,136
Speaker 0: Go take some.

873
01:01:43,216 --> 01:01:43,396
Speaker 0: Right.

874
01:01:43,477 --> 01:01:48,490
Speaker 0: It's like he's like, you know, I also the boss didn't have a wrong attitude.

875
01:01:48,590 --> 01:01:49,233
Speaker 0: I like the boss.

876
01:01:49,534 --> 01:01:51,281
Speaker 1: I've never experienced altitude sickness.

877
01:01:51,301 --> 01:01:53,450
Speaker 1: The closest I've gotten is in Park City, Utah.

878
01:01:53,711 --> 01:01:54,453
Speaker 0: Oh, that was a good.

879
01:01:54,493 --> 01:02:00,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was an abstracted an abstract art scene of like trying to convey what it feels like to have the altitude sickness.

880
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:07,230
Speaker 0: That was a really that was like the highlight scene animation wise, I think, because it's almost like you hear about like a blackout or a white out.

881
01:02:08,611 --> 01:02:13,470
Speaker 1: The closest I've ever experienced to that is like you could call it a red out almost, but it is like this.

882
01:02:14,211 --> 01:02:20,230
Speaker 1: Your eyes are just like it's almost like your eyes are closed and you're looking through your own eyelids, like if you're oxygen deprived to that point.

883
01:02:21,311 --> 01:02:24,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have no intention of ever being in a situation where that could happen.

884
01:02:26,012 --> 01:02:31,030
Speaker 1: I mean, that it's kind of from what I've read about altitude sickness, it's not even a matter of skill.

885
01:02:31,911 --> 01:02:33,298
Speaker 1: It's a matter of genetic luck.

886
01:02:33,559 --> 01:02:34,785
Speaker 1: How, how much it affects you.

887
01:02:35,650 --> 01:02:35,750
Speaker 0: Yeah.

888
01:02:35,810 --> 01:02:38,338
Speaker 0: But I'm just not going anywhere high up.

889
01:02:38,378 --> 01:02:38,840
Speaker 0: Period.

890
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,150
Speaker 1: Whether I have the genetic problem, you never want to get to the top of Mount Fuji.

891
01:02:44,461 --> 01:02:45,505
Speaker 0: No, it's a new volcano.

892
01:02:45,746 --> 01:02:45,927
Speaker 0: Yeah.

893
01:02:46,529 --> 01:02:46,790
Speaker 1: It's fine.

894
01:02:46,830 --> 01:02:49,160
Speaker 1: I can go off like dangerous and call it all the time.

895
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:51,780
Speaker 1: Actually, we're planning to climb it when we go back to Japan.

896
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:53,000
Speaker 1: Okay.

897
01:02:53,061 --> 01:02:57,360
Speaker 1: I was literally researching routes last week before we decided to watch Summit of the Gods.

898
01:02:58,101 --> 01:02:58,678
Speaker 0: Well, don't fall.

899
01:02:59,641 --> 01:03:00,323
Speaker 1: I don't think I will.

900
01:03:01,146 --> 01:03:02,871
Speaker 0: But yeah, I haven't read it.

901
01:03:02,891 --> 01:03:05,600
Speaker 0: I'm sure falling off of Mount Fuji was a regular occurrence.

902
01:03:05,901 --> 01:03:07,439
Speaker 0: I know I'd read stories about it.

903
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:14,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, there was just an almost fatal fall, apparently, that YouTube kept recommending to me, probably because I was Googling Mount Fuji a bunch.

904
01:03:15,761 --> 01:03:18,430
Speaker 0: Well, I guess, you know, that's you're not going up there.

905
01:03:19,353 --> 01:03:19,754
Speaker 0: I'll take that.

906
01:03:19,795 --> 01:03:20,557
Speaker 0: Is there a cable car?

907
01:03:20,577 --> 01:03:21,300
Speaker 0: I'll take the cable car.

908
01:03:21,540 --> 01:03:22,345
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a bunch of old.

909
01:03:22,406 --> 01:03:23,453
Speaker 0: Can I bike up Mount Fuji?

910
01:03:23,714 --> 01:03:24,137
Speaker 1: I don't know.

911
01:03:24,157 --> 01:03:24,540
Speaker 0: Is there a road?

912
01:03:24,900 --> 01:03:26,051
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of old people.

913
01:03:26,091 --> 01:03:26,999
Speaker 1: ways to get up there, though.

914
01:03:27,520 --> 01:03:33,080
Speaker 0: That's that definitely seems like too tall for a road, a biking.

915
01:03:36,382 --> 01:03:45,880
Speaker 1: Well, hey, if you once covid dies down, one thing I am planning to do just with our friend group is head out, get a cabin up in the Adirondacks because I want to go climb more high peaks.

916
01:03:46,461 --> 01:03:52,420
Speaker 1: Like I've been up there in a long time and a bunch of our friends like hiking so I can plot a hike for like the people who don't want to climb mountains.

917
01:03:52,941 --> 01:03:56,240
Speaker 1: Me and Emily and like maybe Scojo and a few other people are going to go climb a few mountains.

918
01:03:57,041 --> 01:04:00,060
Speaker 1: You could just come on that trip and bike up Whiteface while we're climbing it.

919
01:04:01,965 --> 01:04:03,480
Speaker 0: Is that the only one that has a road, though?

920
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:05,340
Speaker 1: That's the only one I know of that has a road.

921
01:04:06,181 --> 01:04:07,080
Speaker 0: I only bike on roads.

922
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:09,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you you bike up Whiteface and back down.

923
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,018
Speaker 0: Any other any other roads out there?

924
01:04:12,340 --> 01:04:14,468
Speaker 1: Well, a few roads, a few of us.

925
01:04:14,589 --> 01:04:14,870
Speaker 1: Let's see.

926
01:04:14,910 --> 01:04:17,500
Speaker 1: Last time I was there, I climbed Whiteface and some other mountain.

927
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:22,120
Speaker 1: And the time before that, we did the two Wolf's Jaws and Gothics and a mountain I don't remember the name of.

928
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:26,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, not interested in going up the mountain.

929
01:04:27,603 --> 01:04:29,219
Speaker 1: Put it on your bike and we'll do something else.

930
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,628
Speaker 1: But anyway, this movie is just on Netflix.

931
01:04:31,749 --> 01:04:34,460
Speaker 1: Like if you have Netflix, it's only 90 minutes long.

932
01:04:34,980 --> 01:04:38,114
Speaker 1: It's beautifully animated for the most part.

933
01:04:38,436 --> 01:04:39,199
Speaker 1: It's well worth watching.

934
01:04:39,620 --> 01:04:44,300
Speaker 0: You know, you just spent probably close to that long listening to this Geek Nights episode.

935
01:04:44,840 --> 01:04:45,419
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

936
01:04:45,560 --> 01:04:46,586
Speaker 1: Just go watch the movie right now.

937
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:49,080
Speaker 1: We literally both watched it right before we did this show.

938
01:04:54,820 --> 01:04:56,960

Speaker 1: We just watched the movie right before we did the show.

950
01:05:49,040 --> 01:05:50,092
Speaker 1: I think you'll enjoy it.

951
01:05:50,112 --> 01:05:50,779
Speaker 1: You should watch it too.

952
01:05:51,541 --> 01:05:53,379
Speaker 1: And right now, I'll just leave you with...
