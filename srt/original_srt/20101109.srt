4
00:00:18,901 --> 00:00:19,897
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:23,245 --> 00:00:26,990
Speaker 1: So of course now that is the end of biking season no chance of biking until next year.

6
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:32,109
Speaker 1: I just bought all the lights that I needed for my bike to be biking at night.

7
00:00:32,531 --> 00:00:41,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, I often buy things at a season and then the season comes around and then you know, yeah, it's weird I never thought to do it until like the very end of bike season.

8
00:00:41,046 --> 00:00:41,950
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh bike lights.

9
00:00:43,312 --> 00:00:44,275
Speaker 1: Now I got him sitting here.

10
00:00:44,857 --> 00:00:53,703
Speaker 1: one thing though the one I got the rear light there was this like Amazon description of it and it was like this thing will annoy the ever-living.

11
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:58,662
Speaker 1: and then it was fuck kind of blocked out Of anyone behind you and no car will miss you.

12
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:03,058
Speaker 1: It is bright as fuck Alrighty, so it is bright as fuck.

13
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:03,980
Speaker 0: Oh god damn it.

14
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:05,003
Speaker 0: What kind did you buy?

15
00:01:05,022 --> 00:01:06,407
Speaker 1: I bought that.

16
00:01:06,427 --> 00:01:09,575
Speaker 1: the I fucker apparently Can't be legal.

17
00:01:09,635 --> 00:01:09,957
Speaker 0: Well, it's.

18
00:01:10,098 --> 00:01:13,899
Speaker 1: it's this bright on purpose for during the day You leave it on the solid beam.

19
00:01:13,999 --> 00:01:15,446
Speaker 1: that'll basically blind anyone.

20
00:01:15,968 --> 00:01:20,090
Speaker 0: and at night Why would you want to use it at all that has a patented annoying blink pattern?

21
00:01:22,094 --> 00:01:23,087
Speaker 1: So no one can miss you.

22
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:24,975
Speaker 1: This thing is so bright.

23
00:01:25,015 --> 00:01:25,356
Speaker 1: It hurts.

24
00:01:25,477 --> 00:01:26,963
Speaker 0: I mean, there's two kinds of bike lights.

25
00:01:27,104 --> 00:01:28,570
Speaker 0: right this see and be seen.

26
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:30,736
Speaker 1: Yep, this is this is be seen.

27
00:01:30,796 --> 00:01:35,269
Speaker 0: it's the rear light only it is definitely be seen but that is like be more seen.

28
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:41,270
Speaker 1: Well, if I blind the driver behind me he might crash and then I won't have to worry about him into you.

29
00:01:44,572 --> 00:01:46,021
Speaker 1: How annoying is this shit?

30
00:01:46,625 --> 00:01:47,310
Speaker 0: this is great.

31
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:47,992
Speaker 0: So I went.

32
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:50,922
Speaker 0: Amazon had to sail where it was by two games.

33
00:01:50,942 --> 00:01:53,090
Speaker 0: get one free to like any games.

34
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:54,438
Speaker 0: Well, no video games.

35
00:01:54,538 --> 00:01:56,310
Speaker 1: and I was gonna say I'm gonna go buy some board game.

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,850
Speaker 0: No, and the thing was the list consisted mostly of pretty much every new video game for consoles, right?

37
00:02:03,113 --> 00:02:04,870
Speaker 1: Almost all I should have paid attention.

38
00:02:05,452 --> 00:02:17,438
Speaker 0: It was actually a rare opportunity to get a Nintendo game for cheap because if you bought three Wii games Even if they were the $50 kind published by Nintendo that never go down in price even after 20 years You could actually get 33% off.

39
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:31,477
Speaker 1: so because yeah If I enumerate all the game the physical media games I own for my Xbox that didn't come free with the Xbox I got Super Street Fighter 4 Mm-hmm Me too, so I ordered.

40
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:35,510
Speaker 0: I ordered a rock band three cuz I'm gonna get that guitar when it comes out in March.

41
00:02:35,851 --> 00:02:38,122
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just waiting but I will get that.

42
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:42,098
Speaker 0: and I ordered The curvy with the yarn.

43
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:42,842
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

44
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:43,646
Speaker 1: I heard that was good.

45
00:02:43,928 --> 00:02:50,970
Speaker 0: and the The Metroid one even though that's I heard it's not so good, but it's a Metroid game.

46
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:51,954
Speaker 0: So whatever.

47
00:02:52,516 --> 00:02:55,950
Speaker 0: and I basically got one of the games for free because there was a sale.

48
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,590
Speaker 0: The thing was these games showed up and I hadn't yet replaced my Wii or Xbox.

49
00:03:00,052 --> 00:03:11,225
Speaker 0: so on an Amazon and I bought a Wii and I bought an Xbox and and for the same price as you know, they came out just now with a Mario anniversary edition Wii that comes with the Mario Brothers Wii.

50
00:03:11,345 --> 00:03:12,850
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, isn't it like red or something?

51
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,105
Speaker 0: It's red and it also comes with a wiimote that has motion plus in it.

52
00:03:16,567 --> 00:03:17,090
Speaker 1: Not bad.

53
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:19,444
Speaker 0: So it's the same price as the regular old Wii.

54
00:03:19,464 --> 00:03:19,826
Speaker 0: so I bought.

55
00:03:19,847 --> 00:03:31,536
Speaker 0: I got that It didn't show up yet though And I also bought an Xbox is basically the same as the Xbox I had before only the new slim kind and it comes with Forza and some other game.

56
00:03:31,617 --> 00:03:33,484
Speaker 1: Oh, I got fours that came with mine.

57
00:03:33,524 --> 00:03:33,966
Speaker 1: I've got it.

58
00:03:34,006 --> 00:03:35,030
Speaker 1: I've never even opened it.

59
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:37,664
Speaker 1: I also came with like Halo something this comes with not halo.

60
00:03:37,704 --> 00:03:38,870
Speaker 0: It's like Alan Wake.

61
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,881
Speaker 1: I think I got Halo something and fours is something and I have not.

62
00:03:41,941 --> 00:03:46,750
Speaker 0: so the thing was I ordered the Xbox and then I Ordered the Wii and the Xbox is gonna come like this week.

63
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:50,305
Speaker 0: But after I ordered the Wii they combined them another coming in like two weeks.

64
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:54,002
Speaker 0: It's like ah you fucks I just bought these games now.

65
00:03:54,043 --> 00:03:55,610
Speaker 0: I can't play them because you didn't send me the system.

66
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,824
Speaker 1: See luckily actually of all things I've been playing lately Scott Pilgrim.

67
00:03:58,845 --> 00:03:59,929
Speaker 1: I've been actually working through.

68
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,395
Speaker 1: It's actually kind of hard.

69
00:04:02,576 --> 00:04:03,761
Speaker 0: Oh the beating up game.

70
00:04:03,801 --> 00:04:04,042
Speaker 0: Yes.

71
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:04,925
Speaker 0: It's really hard.

72
00:04:04,965 --> 00:04:06,110
Speaker 0: You need help to beat that shit.

73
00:04:06,292 --> 00:04:07,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been trying to beat it on my own.

74
00:04:07,563 --> 00:04:09,961
Speaker 1: just to get you know I was never that good at those kinds of games.

75
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:11,229
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I'm working my way up.

76
00:04:11,511 --> 00:04:13,770
Speaker 0: You're really good at just turning around and beating up your friends.

77
00:04:14,313 --> 00:04:15,300
Speaker 1: I believe I was not.

78
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:21,829
Speaker 1: what I was not good at was Dealing with the fact that certain unnamed partners would jump in front of my goddamn lead pipe.

79
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:24,845
Speaker 1: Hey, I'd be beating a boss up and then scotch like her.

80
00:04:24,886 --> 00:04:31,270
Speaker 0: better better More like you positioned your lead pipe, you know at the exact spot the other who I was gonna be.

81
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:34,965
Speaker 1: There's something wrong here because when you played with like Adam, it was fine.

82
00:04:35,286 --> 00:04:39,363
Speaker 1: when I played with Adam It was fine when you played with me lead pipe face.

83
00:04:39,503 --> 00:04:41,573
Speaker 0: I think it's just you're trying to do it Obviously.

84
00:04:41,593 --> 00:04:41,894
Speaker 0: now.

85
00:04:41,934 --> 00:04:48,730
Speaker 1: if I'm trying to do it, I just turn around and kill you which you did Sometimes all the time, but not all the time all the time sometimes.

86
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:53,470
Speaker 1: Actually, I was playing counter-strike yesterday, right and I kicked the terrorist.

87
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,938
Speaker 1: We're laying like dust and I just rushed in.

88
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:59,610
Speaker 1: I killed like three terrorists and I circle around back and I run forward.

89
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:07,310
Speaker 1: I'm doing great and one of my teammates literally falls down like from the ledge turns around sees me and deagle headshots me dead.

90
00:05:08,113 --> 00:05:09,539
Speaker 0: Right that was on of course.

91
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:14,235
Speaker 1: All right team kill is like the best way to play anyway, and Yeah, that sucked.

92
00:05:14,557 --> 00:05:16,284
Speaker 1: okay that anecdote didn't really go anywhere.

93
00:05:16,304 --> 00:05:19,894
Speaker 1: I just played a lot of counter-strike And super meat.

94
00:05:19,914 --> 00:05:21,000
Speaker 1: boy, I actually bought that.

95
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,950
Speaker 0: I was gonna buy it when I got my xbox.

96
00:05:23,391 --> 00:05:28,390
Speaker 1: It's the best part about it is the fact that it's a hard console, but faster.

97
00:05:28,531 --> 00:05:35,386
Speaker 1: It is hard but fair But it does the replay thing where once you finally beat something it shows simultaneously every failed attempt.

98
00:05:35,928 --> 00:05:36,730
Speaker 0: No, that's awesome.

99
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:45,196
Speaker 1: So basically on some of the hard ones you see this sea of like a thousand meat boys dying One meat boy making it through.

100
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:45,879
Speaker 0: that's awesome.

101
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,785
Speaker 1: You'll see me like a hundred of them.

102
00:05:47,825 --> 00:05:49,209
Speaker 1: Just barely missing the bonus.

103
00:05:50,614 --> 00:05:51,242
Speaker 1: It's good times.

104
00:05:51,323 --> 00:05:51,647
Speaker 1: actually.

105
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:55,599
Speaker 0: The game's actually really fun.

106
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:56,424
Speaker 0: I do I want to get.

107
00:05:56,464 --> 00:05:57,590
Speaker 0: I just don't have an xbox cuz.

108
00:05:58,832 --> 00:06:01,582
Speaker 0: No, poor xbox gonna take like a couple weeks for a new one to show up.

109
00:06:01,703 --> 00:06:02,947
Speaker 1: So you got any goo.

110
00:06:03,068 --> 00:06:05,915
Speaker 1: gaming news Xbox news Xbox news.

111
00:06:06,076 --> 00:06:07,960
Speaker 0: so people don't realize this right.

112
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:14,902
Speaker 0: but like xbox games are actually sort of in like four or five different Categories and it's hard people to understand this.

113
00:06:14,962 --> 00:06:16,730
Speaker 0: right this xbox games you buy in a disc.

114
00:06:17,332 --> 00:06:23,070
Speaker 0: There's Xbox games that are full-on buying a disc games, but you buy them on the Xbox and you download them.

115
00:06:23,151 --> 00:06:24,308
Speaker 0: You don't have to get this.

116
00:06:25,151 --> 00:06:26,255
Speaker 0: Then there's games that are like.

117
00:06:26,275 --> 00:06:31,820
Speaker 0: so like these live play games or it's like you don't have to download the whole game You can sort of play it.

118
00:06:32,283 --> 00:06:33,390
Speaker 0: I don't understand really how it works.

119
00:06:34,953 --> 00:06:45,198
Speaker 0: But anyway, then this xbox live arcade games Which is like it's sort of basically the same thing as we wear and this is what you get with your super meat boys and your Scott pilgrims, right and your whatnots.

120
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:48,810
Speaker 0: It's like a full-on game, but it's not a disc game.

121
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:51,241
Speaker 0: It's like it, you know, but it's not an indie game.

122
00:06:51,281 --> 00:06:53,270
Speaker 0: It's actually a real publisher makes a game.

123
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:56,270
Speaker 0: That's supposed to be a downloaded game like puzzle quest is in there.

124
00:06:56,410 --> 00:06:57,274
Speaker 0: You know that sort of stuff.

125
00:06:57,535 --> 00:07:01,250
Speaker 1: a lot of them are basically just slightly better versions of flash games.

126
00:07:01,511 --> 00:07:06,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then there's indie games that you're actually separate and it's like the indie games.

127
00:07:06,852 --> 00:07:10,430
Speaker 0: You have to make them with XNA and there's all these limitations on what you can do.

128
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,390
Speaker 1: Apparently you have to make all of them abstract shapes jumping in rhythm because 90% of them are abstract.

129
00:07:16,471 --> 00:07:17,830
Speaker 1: They're basically law of the ribbon.

130
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:23,806
Speaker 0: Yeah but basically these indie games just anyone can make one and then you have to submit it for approval.

131
00:07:23,866 --> 00:07:26,395
Speaker 0: and basically approval means Like ten people.

132
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:31,033
Speaker 0: check it out to make sure there's no bugs or whatever and you meet certain Requirements.

133
00:07:31,073 --> 00:07:32,961
Speaker 0: like it will work at different resolutions.

134
00:07:32,981 --> 00:07:34,970
Speaker 0: It has a demo and what I might go for it.

135
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,054
Speaker 1: I've been learning the XNA.

136
00:07:36,435 --> 00:07:40,690
Speaker 0: you just had to meet these requirements and then it's in and you can't charge more than five bucks.

137
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:43,432
Speaker 0: You have to charge at least a dollar, you know I forget exactly.

138
00:07:44,014 --> 00:07:44,837
Speaker 0: and then it goes in.

139
00:07:44,897 --> 00:08:00,030
Speaker 0: and basically what happened is they came with XNA for and the thing is there you They sort of they took silverlight which was originally competing with flash and now they're basically saying hey Make apps for the Windows Phone 7 using silverlight instead, you know.

140
00:08:00,452 --> 00:08:02,982
Speaker 0: And so now instead of competing with flash which isn't gonna work.

141
00:08:03,023 --> 00:08:08,958
Speaker 0: They're gonna be like, hey, it's a development platform And it kind of works that way There's a remarketing it and then they're like XNA.

142
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:09,880
Speaker 0: you there are.

143
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,330
Speaker 0: XNA originally was used to make Xbox PC and Zune games.

144
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:18,228
Speaker 0: It's not like well Zune is dead but make Windows Phone 7 games with XNA.

145
00:08:18,268 --> 00:08:18,629
Speaker 0: Yeah,

146
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:18,709
Speaker 1: and

147
00:08:19,950 --> 00:08:43,616
Speaker 0: Yeah, they basically redid the whole XNA creators Club website to really target it at the phone development and the whole indie game development part sort of disappeared Mostly not completely but mostly and in the new Xbox interface which came out because of the Kinect they moved the indie games from one section to another and everyone was like Are you trying to get rid of us?

148
00:08:44,118 --> 00:08:46,104
Speaker 0: So they caved and moved them back, which is good.

149
00:08:46,586 --> 00:08:49,755
Speaker 0: But even so it's like It looks like Microsoft.

150
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,602
Speaker 0: they already treat these indie game people like crap.

151
00:08:52,723 --> 00:08:55,390
Speaker 0: and then it's like why even have it in a separate section?

152
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:04,724
Speaker 0: just let people who make games make games and Let them put it in the Xbox thing arcade section with all the other game.

153
00:09:04,804 --> 00:09:05,606
Speaker 0: what they're afraid of?

154
00:09:05,927 --> 00:09:08,158
Speaker 1: even though it's not saying This is a legitimate fear.

155
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:10,270
Speaker 1: They're afraid of the old Atari situation.

156
00:09:10,391 --> 00:09:16,390
Speaker 1: They don't want people to log in and go on Xbox Live arcade and be like I want to buy a new game and it's a sea of shit.

157
00:09:16,712 --> 00:09:23,868
Speaker 1: Well, here's what you do, right if it's shit, you know You're gonna have a category for bad games.

158
00:09:23,888 --> 00:09:31,290
Speaker 1: I Would say there's a. there should be a clause that if a game is bad enough Yeah You have to let them distribute it and it doesn't charge.

159
00:09:31,832 --> 00:09:38,239
Speaker 0: It doesn't really matter because if you just go on the Xbox and you go to the Xbox Live arcade you say show me the Bestsellers and there's all the games that you want.

160
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:38,580
Speaker 0: Yep.

161
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:40,650
Speaker 0: You've had to go searching around.

162
00:09:41,032 --> 00:09:43,570
Speaker 0: So none of the good game none of the shitty games are gonna show up there.

163
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,473
Speaker 0: So who gives a crap?

164
00:09:45,075 --> 00:09:49,090
Speaker 0: and another thing that I don't like they should let people put up games for free.

165
00:09:49,512 --> 00:09:52,369
Speaker 0: If I want to make a game for free, I should be allowed to do that.

166
00:09:52,651 --> 00:10:03,001
Speaker 1: I know even evil Apple lets you do that Because I couldn't imagine ever making a game short of like a big-deal game That I would stick up there that I actually want to charge money for.

167
00:10:03,082 --> 00:10:14,573
Speaker 0: even big companies might want to make a game purely for promotional purposes Like maybe they want to make a game that's solely for advertising like they make a game based on a movie That's about to come out and it's not a very good game Promotional game.

168
00:10:14,593 --> 00:10:15,578
Speaker 1: No, no, they're not gonna give that.

169
00:10:15,598 --> 00:10:16,181
Speaker 0: why would they?

170
00:10:16,402 --> 00:10:18,110
Speaker 0: why would they want to charge money for that?

171
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,808
Speaker 1: They should just make it because promotional games get bought by grandmas who don't know better for nephews.

172
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,962
Speaker 0: But no, but this is Xbox Live Arcade.

173
00:10:24,983 --> 00:10:27,476
Speaker 0: This isn't disc in the store Yeah, but grandma I'll do it.

174
00:10:27,537 --> 00:10:30,289
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I can't possibly buy a game on the Xbox.

175
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:32,213
Speaker 1: I You know, we're gonna.

176
00:10:32,334 --> 00:10:34,761
Speaker 1: someday we're gonna have the techno grandma at that.

177
00:10:34,882 --> 00:10:37,550
Speaker 0: most grandma will give you Xbox Live points to buy a game.

178
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,638
Speaker 0: But you know if you want people to go let's say Tron.

179
00:10:41,658 --> 00:10:47,460
Speaker 0: you make a Tron game a crappy little Tron game to promote the movie that's Coming up and you make the game free.

180
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,404
Speaker 0: They should be allowed to do that.

181
00:10:48,926 --> 00:10:49,890
Speaker 1: Is there a minimum price?

182
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:50,835
Speaker 1: Can I be like a penny?

183
00:10:50,895 --> 00:10:51,539
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a dollar.

184
00:10:51,921 --> 00:10:53,189
Speaker 1: Oh, well, it's not that bad.

185
00:10:53,672 --> 00:10:55,965
Speaker 0: So would you pay a dollar for promotional piece of shit?

186
00:10:56,045 --> 00:10:56,950
Speaker 0: That might not be a crowd.

187
00:10:57,573 --> 00:10:58,766
Speaker 1: Maybe they don't want that stuff in there.

188
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:10,461
Speaker 1: But the thing is they can have that stuff in there and help them out plus at the same time one thing I mean, I can't imagine a game I would make Crappy, I mean, I'm not saying I agree with them.

189
00:11:10,843 --> 00:11:12,190
Speaker 1: I'm just saying it's not that bad.

190
00:11:12,732 --> 00:11:20,684
Speaker 0: The only thing is right is like on the one hand we look at the Atari example and we say oh man If you get a ton of shovelware, you're fucked.

191
00:11:20,705 --> 00:11:26,057
Speaker 1: Ah, but on the other hand example look at 99% of NES games are shit.

192
00:11:26,097 --> 00:11:27,601
Speaker 0: Look at every little shit.

193
00:11:27,641 --> 00:11:30,567
Speaker 0: Look at everything since the Atari right?

194
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,184
Speaker 0: Let's see DS GBA.

195
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:35,254
Speaker 0: You know the.

196
00:11:35,575 --> 00:11:36,659
Speaker 1: we see now Scott.

197
00:11:36,679 --> 00:11:37,502
Speaker 1: Here's the difference.

198
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:38,705
Speaker 1: Here's the difference.

199
00:11:38,966 --> 00:11:40,090
Speaker 0: all tons of shop.

200
00:11:41,211 --> 00:11:41,933
Speaker 1: Here's the difference.

201
00:11:42,193 --> 00:11:48,309
Speaker 1: the shovelware we get within it like with the old Nintendo seal of approval or seal of quality or whatever.

202
00:11:48,991 --> 00:11:54,850
Speaker 1: Those games at least will boot and will play to complete even the Xbox live indie games.

203
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,897
Speaker 0: They force them to do that.

204
00:11:55,917 --> 00:11:56,702
Speaker 0: the Atari games.

205
00:11:56,863 --> 00:12:04,070
Speaker 0: someone wouldn't that's true But you know the most successful money makers are the people who are loaded with the shovelware iPhone.

206
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:07,962
Speaker 1: Come on that's all pay shovelware.

207
00:12:08,022 --> 00:12:09,530
Speaker 0: I'm just know this free shovelware?

208
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:10,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the pay shovel?

209
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:11,309
Speaker 1: where's where the money is?

210
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:18,636
Speaker 0: I'm just saying people if people are gonna pay for a fart app and then someone else is gonna make a free fart app They still pay because the pain is better.

211
00:12:18,656 --> 00:12:20,101
Speaker 0: King Apple mad bank.

212
00:12:20,141 --> 00:12:22,850
Speaker 0: Then Xbox should also have the free and paid fart app.

213
00:12:24,431 --> 00:12:36,530
Speaker 1: Actually an Xbox fart app wouldn't be that on useful If everyone can see on the TV that you're making farts if you could run it in the background and bind it to a Key and then it would fart over the microphones.

214
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:37,605
Speaker 0: multiplayer.

215
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:55,649
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna skip a lot of the details of this but this is an article from October 20th about how some dudes made hacks for Starcraft 2 to cheat at the game in single-player and some other people made ones to cheat the game in multiplayer.

216
00:12:55,670 --> 00:13:00,729
Speaker 1: and There was the brouhaha where Blizzard was banning people for cheating in the single-player game.

217
00:13:01,373 --> 00:13:03,969
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know this reminds me of something.

218
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:08,356
Speaker 0: be net D ha ha Fucking blizzard.

219
00:13:08,658 --> 00:13:10,027
Speaker 1: Why do you always do the same stuff?

220
00:13:10,269 --> 00:13:14,847
Speaker 0: But What amazed me was that most people don't even know what the hell be 90 here.

221
00:13:14,867 --> 00:13:15,310
Speaker 1: We're old.

222
00:13:15,571 --> 00:13:16,398
Speaker 1: That's why we're making that's.

223
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:19,454
Speaker 1: that's the theme of our new geek Back in the day.

224
00:13:19,494 --> 00:13:24,190
Speaker 0: There was just as many be net D news stories on the slash dot as there were SEO stories.

225
00:13:27,191 --> 00:13:30,539
Speaker 1: Wow, I feel really old suddenly and the show's even gonna make me feel older.

226
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:38,830
Speaker 1: but so the rationale for this which is amazing Is that if you cheat in the single-player game in an unauthorized manner?

227
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,677
Speaker 0: You can't get his authorized cheating.

228
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:44,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, we really need to get on that shit.

229
00:13:44,108 --> 00:13:44,670
Speaker 0: That's so bad.

230
00:13:46,431 --> 00:13:46,572
Speaker 1: Like.

231
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,679
Speaker 1: do you see that college humor of like three?

232
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,389
Speaker 1: Okay Starcraft players against one like world champion.

233
00:13:51,489 --> 00:13:53,177
Speaker 1: Yeah He's just like toying with them.

234
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:58,465
Speaker 0: I mean the thing is it's like It would be okay almost if it wasn't.

235
00:13:58,867 --> 00:14:00,414
Speaker 0: I don't know It's like why is that?

236
00:14:00,554 --> 00:14:01,658
Speaker 0: give me a bad feeling.

237
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:06,526
Speaker 0: but like Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson playing against a normal person Doesn't give you a bad feeling.

238
00:14:06,566 --> 00:14:07,635
Speaker 0: it's like yep That's how it should be.

239
00:14:07,957 --> 00:14:13,101
Speaker 0: but when a Starcraft died as it's like oh It's so wrong because Michael Jordan is to is to basketball.

240
00:14:13,342 --> 00:14:15,430
Speaker 1: a pale comparison as to what these Starcraft.

241
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:25,070
Speaker 0: But if you go to play basketball against the worst guy in the entire NBA like The guy who warms the bench all season right and never never even touches the ball.

242
00:14:25,852 --> 00:14:26,935
Speaker 0: You're get you're still gonna.

243
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:29,002
Speaker 1: I have a feeling Starcraft is like that too.

244
00:14:29,704 --> 00:14:30,947
Speaker 1: Yeah anyone in a league.

245
00:14:31,048 --> 00:14:31,790
Speaker 1: I got no chance.

246
00:14:32,133 --> 00:14:34,271
Speaker 1: I'm I won't even get a unit built I don't.

247
00:14:34,331 --> 00:14:34,773
Speaker 0: but it's like.

248
00:14:34,853 --> 00:14:39,170
Speaker 0: why does it feel okay for it to per when it's like a sport or something legitimate?

249
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:39,712
Speaker 0: But it does.

250
00:14:39,732 --> 00:14:42,867
Speaker 0: it feels like there's something cruel and wrong and amiss when it's Starcraft.

251
00:14:42,928 --> 00:14:43,430
Speaker 1: Well big one.

252
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,895
Speaker 1: There's something hilarious about the.

253
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:49,429
Speaker 1: I may imagining the Detroit Red Wings playing against like some six-year-olds in South Park.

254
00:14:49,529 --> 00:14:52,278
Speaker 1: Yes And two, I don't know.

255
00:14:52,318 --> 00:14:54,770
Speaker 1: I think it was because that video had the guy the guys playing.

256
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,272
Speaker 1: It's film.

257
00:14:55,292 --> 00:14:58,990
Speaker 1: the two sides and the people trying to beat the expert are like, I think he's just toying with us.

258
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:01,889
Speaker 1: I think he could beat us at any time and it was true.

259
00:15:02,491 --> 00:15:09,770
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the rationale for banning people who cheated single-player with unauthorized cheats is that it messes up the achievement system.

260
00:15:11,971 --> 00:15:13,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't even have to say anything.

261
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:14,466
Speaker 1: yeah, let that go.

262
00:15:14,928 --> 00:15:17,607
Speaker 1: the thing I want to point out is that blizzard is going one step further.

263
00:15:17,627 --> 00:15:20,539
Speaker 1: in blizzard We met a bunch of your developers at PAX.

264
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,285
Speaker 0: I'm not a bunch of you guys.

265
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:23,610
Speaker 1: I know you guys are totally cool.

266
00:15:23,711 --> 00:15:25,138
Speaker 1: this is not a disparaging of you.

267
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:32,850
Speaker 1: blizzard is suing and Pursuing legal action against three developers who made hacks.

268
00:15:33,151 --> 00:15:38,730
Speaker 0: I'm pretty confident that if blizzard consisted of nothing but developers and artists that this would not happen, right?

269
00:15:39,011 --> 00:15:42,025
Speaker 0: It's it's simply that you know, it's like go to any company.

270
00:15:42,065 --> 00:15:42,849
Speaker 0: go to the evilest.

271
00:15:42,889 --> 00:15:43,030
Speaker 0: come.

272
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:45,527
Speaker 0: What's the evilest company you could think of right now?

273
00:15:45,567 --> 00:15:46,730
Speaker 1: It's BP All right.

274
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:54,979
Speaker 1: So you go to BP right and you find that what I just said is in no way an indication of any like actual Advice to invest in any company.

275
00:15:55,703 --> 00:16:05,982
Speaker 0: I have to say things like we got it We go to BP right and we go and find like the guy who drives the truck to deliver the gas or You know the guy who makes the website.

276
00:16:06,002 --> 00:16:06,544
Speaker 0: It's not evil.

277
00:16:06,745 --> 00:16:09,133
Speaker 0: They're totally just normal Evil.

278
00:16:09,173 --> 00:16:10,619
Speaker 1: dude watch maybe they are evil.

279
00:16:11,081 --> 00:16:12,950
Speaker 0: The only is really just reliquor.

280
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:19,981
Speaker 0: You know, it's just a few maybe a few evil people or maybe just a couple people who are like, you know They don't like what they're doing, but it's their job.

281
00:16:20,001 --> 00:16:22,554
Speaker 0: Like there's that web developer He's totally not evil.

282
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:26,830
Speaker 0: But then you know, the boss is like you got to improve the Google ranking.

283
00:16:26,910 --> 00:16:28,398
Speaker 0: I brought in this evil SEO guy.

284
00:16:28,418 --> 00:16:30,550
Speaker 0: You got to do whatever he does or he says you're fired.

285
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:31,415
Speaker 0: You're like, oh fuck.

286
00:16:31,435 --> 00:16:40,225
Speaker 0: I don't want to do evil SEO that the S and it's like aha You have to do it and SEO guys like hey It's really easy to make a ton of money selling his SEO bullshit to companies.

287
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:40,868
Speaker 0: I don't care.

288
00:16:40,908 --> 00:16:41,410
Speaker 1: Here's the trouble.

289
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,800
Speaker 0: I know it's evil whatever.

290
00:16:42,921 --> 00:16:49,266
Speaker 1: from the first day I got my cable modem and I went online and I played quake one against other people.

291
00:16:49,286 --> 00:16:53,730
Speaker 1: I Was afraid of cheaters, I wish cheating was illegal.

292
00:16:54,172 --> 00:16:57,888
Speaker 1: I wanted nothing more than a way to punch through the screen at people who were clearly cheating.

293
00:16:57,969 --> 00:17:02,743
Speaker 1: Yes At the same time it is not illegal to cheat.

294
00:17:03,044 --> 00:17:04,869
Speaker 1: in most situations in the world.

295
00:17:05,311 --> 00:17:08,270
Speaker 0: You can cheat a monopoly as long as you don't cheat in a casino.

296
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:11,010
Speaker 0: Hey, you know, it should be totally cool.

297
00:17:11,178 --> 00:17:19,849
Speaker 0: Yeah I actually I think what most games need is they simply just need like what half-life has which is like hey This is a no cheat server and this is a cheat server.

298
00:17:20,191 --> 00:17:22,478
Speaker 0: If you want to cheat on the cheat server go nuts.

299
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:25,226
Speaker 1: if you cheat on the non cheat server banned forever.

300
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:26,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's you know.

301
00:17:27,752 --> 00:17:28,095
Speaker 0: Why not?

302
00:17:28,377 --> 00:17:28,840
Speaker 0: I call it a day.

303
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:31,716
Speaker 0: I'm Welcome.

304
00:17:31,736 --> 00:17:34,870
Speaker 0: Starcraft doesn't have the okay cheat server and the not okay cheat server.

305
00:17:35,693 --> 00:17:37,690
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is here's the trouble.

306
00:17:37,710 --> 00:17:39,520
Speaker 0: I remember Diablo 2 actually had that.

307
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:44,626
Speaker 0: in Diablo 2 you could play on the Open battle net or the real battle and the real battle.

308
00:17:44,667 --> 00:17:45,290
Speaker 0: that was harsh.

309
00:17:45,411 --> 00:17:48,830
Speaker 0: It's like if you died if your guy died there you a dead dead.

310
00:17:48,931 --> 00:17:49,052
Speaker 0: It's.

311
00:17:49,132 --> 00:17:51,230
Speaker 0: it was serious business to play in the real battle net.

312
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,449
Speaker 0: But if you play it on the open battle net it was just like hack your save file.

313
00:17:55,771 --> 00:17:56,996
Speaker 0: Do whatever the fuck you want.

314
00:17:57,017 --> 00:17:58,463
Speaker 0: It's open battle that it's multiplayer.

315
00:17:58,503 --> 00:17:58,885
Speaker 0: do whatever.

316
00:17:58,945 --> 00:17:59,890
Speaker 0: duplicating items.

317
00:18:00,151 --> 00:18:03,522
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah duplicating the whatever that ring that gave you +1 everything.

318
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:03,843
Speaker 0: Yeah.

319
00:18:03,863 --> 00:18:06,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, so how are they suing them?

320
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,453
Speaker 1: It's not illegal to cheat.

321
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:10,319
Speaker 0: It's not illegal to help violating the EULA maybe.

322
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:10,379
Speaker 0: uh

323
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:28,084
Speaker 1: so Quote when the users of the hacks Download install and use the hacks there They copy Starcraft to copyrighted content into their computers RAM in Excess of the scope of their limited license set forth in the EULA and the terms

324
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:29,108
Speaker 0: of the EULA to

325
00:18:29,228 --> 00:18:31,415
Speaker 1: create Derivative works of Starcraft.

326
00:18:31,595 --> 00:18:54,749
Speaker 1: So I bring this up on a Tuesday because this is this language almost word for word Comes up on Mondays a lot because this bullshit is the reason like fundamentally our laws are not keeping up with technology and to argue that you're creating a derivative work of anything in the course of copying into your RAM is Ludicrous to the point that is physically painful.

327
00:18:56,132 --> 00:18:58,118
Speaker 0: Well, let me make an analogy here, right?

328
00:18:58,379 --> 00:18:59,924
Speaker 0: So here's here's what's going on.

329
00:19:00,386 --> 00:19:01,650
Speaker 0: So I have a vinyl record.

330
00:19:02,091 --> 00:19:08,070
Speaker 0: Right, it would be one thing if I copied the vinyl record to a cassette tape or and then remixed it on there.

331
00:19:08,090 --> 00:19:09,355
Speaker 0: Right, that is a derivative work.

332
00:19:09,978 --> 00:19:16,178
Speaker 0: If I take a knife to the final record and just scratch it up No, it's not derivative work.

333
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:18,405
Speaker 0: No, cuz I didn't derive and make a copy.

334
00:19:18,445 --> 00:19:19,989
Speaker 0: I just modified the work in place.

335
00:19:20,672 --> 00:19:23,524
Speaker 1: Ah, but it's a copy in RAM because you have the code.

336
00:19:23,584 --> 00:19:24,890
Speaker 0: Oh, it's the original copy.

337
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:31,209
Speaker 1: See, here's here's the trouble with this argument And this is I can bring it up on Tuesday cuz I could explain it again to people who might not know.

338
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:35,543
Speaker 1: When you run a program, there's variables and shit in your RAM.

339
00:19:35,563 --> 00:19:37,910
Speaker 1: That's copied all over the place.

340
00:19:38,632 --> 00:19:40,016
Speaker 0: To do anything with a computer.

341
00:19:40,237 --> 00:19:40,999
Speaker 0: You must copy.

342
00:19:41,079 --> 00:19:44,529
Speaker 0: the computer has bits and it puts the bits in like ten places at all time.

343
00:19:45,272 --> 00:19:46,377
Speaker 0: That's how computers work.

344
00:19:46,738 --> 00:19:49,510
Speaker 0: See all is impossible to compute anything without copying.

345
00:19:50,133 --> 00:19:51,318
Speaker 1: So it's BS.

346
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,810
Speaker 1: for all the reasons I said, that's all I could say about that.

347
00:19:54,111 --> 00:19:55,602
Speaker 1: You can look into this more if you care.

348
00:19:55,623 --> 00:20:00,910
Speaker 0: I blame this Partially, I mean like Blizzard was against like the V net D in the olden days.

349
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:06,150
Speaker 0: But now I think if Activision had if they had not combined, I don't think it would be this bad.

350
00:20:06,732 --> 00:20:07,917
Speaker 1: No, I don't think it would be this bad.

351
00:20:07,977 --> 00:20:09,403
Speaker 1: And the thing is don't get me wrong.

352
00:20:09,805 --> 00:20:20,143
Speaker 1: I am all for Blizzard and valve and any company that runs online games from making sure that When it is not allowed people are not cheating in multiplayer versus game.

353
00:20:20,204 --> 00:20:20,525
Speaker 0: You know what?

354
00:20:20,545 --> 00:20:21,930
Speaker 0: I think you know, I think I'm gonna do.

355
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:23,135
Speaker 0: What are you gonna do?

356
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:25,265
Speaker 0: No, I figured out the way to stop all cheating.

357
00:20:26,049 --> 00:20:28,380
Speaker 1: Uh Fist through screen technology.

358
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,365
Speaker 0: No, here's how you do it.

359
00:20:29,385 --> 00:20:29,666
Speaker 0: You're ready.

360
00:20:29,686 --> 00:20:30,390
Speaker 0: It's really simple.

361
00:20:31,251 --> 00:20:37,830
Speaker 0: You see right now valve for example, right has cheating servers and non cheating servers, but the cheating servers, right?

362
00:20:37,910 --> 00:20:40,099
Speaker 0: It's like they don't actually give you any cheats.

363
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,670
Speaker 0: You have to still go get some hacked up cheats from somewhere.

364
00:20:43,511 --> 00:20:48,990
Speaker 0: Give people the cheats like sieve to give them a fucking cheat menu with every conceivable cheat imaginable.

365
00:20:49,172 --> 00:20:51,070
Speaker 1: I believe Starcraft has something like that.

366
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:51,452
Speaker 1: I don't know.

367
00:20:51,633 --> 00:20:55,150
Speaker 0: just give them every cheats and no one has to hack or modify the game in any way ever.

368
00:20:55,190 --> 00:20:57,279
Speaker 0: There's no reason to because we already gave you every cheat.

369
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,564
Speaker 0: works perfectly Scott.

370
00:20:58,604 --> 00:21:00,010
Speaker 1: He's and then we'll turn him on.

371
00:21:00,151 --> 00:21:06,290
Speaker 1: Don't kid yourself 90% of the people cheating in Counter-Strike don't want to play on a server where everyone's speed hacking.

372
00:21:06,772 --> 00:21:11,870
Speaker 1: They want to be the one guy who at start appears on the other side and knifes everyone to death.

373
00:21:12,792 --> 00:21:14,962
Speaker 1: All right, which is kind of hilarious the first time it happens.

374
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:16,128
Speaker 0: So here's also what we do.

375
00:21:16,148 --> 00:21:16,450
Speaker 0: You ready?

376
00:21:17,550 --> 00:21:19,145
Speaker 0: I in order to play our game, right?

377
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:24,330
Speaker 0: We get your address because that's what you need to get an account and then we come to your house.

378
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:25,249
Speaker 0: So we punch you in the face.

379
00:21:26,511 --> 00:21:28,964
Speaker 0: I'm done completely like I'm not even joking.

380
00:21:29,004 --> 00:21:30,090
Speaker 0: We actually come to your house.

381
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,238
Speaker 1: You didn't say if they cheat.

382
00:21:32,379 --> 00:21:34,728
Speaker 1: you just said we come to your house and punch you in the face.

383
00:21:34,949 --> 00:21:36,817
Speaker 1: Yeah Just regardless.

384
00:21:36,998 --> 00:21:38,450
Speaker 0: That's the warning shot.

385
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:43,705
Speaker 0: So, you know that if you cheat we you know, we do it to everybody.

386
00:21:43,745 --> 00:21:45,090
Speaker 0: it's like we know where you live.

387
00:21:45,912 --> 00:21:47,849
Speaker 0: Punch you in the face if you cheat.

388
00:21:48,792 --> 00:21:49,858
Speaker 0: We already punched you in the face.

389
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:51,870
Speaker 1: once we may do it again.

390
00:21:52,596 --> 00:21:54,755
Speaker 0: So, I mean you didn't even cheat or anything To get hurt.

391
00:21:56,851 --> 00:22:00,670
Speaker 0: So you just think about what will happen if you cheat on the non cheating server.

392
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,402
Speaker 0: I just want you to think about that because you know feel your face right now.

393
00:22:03,764 --> 00:22:04,628
Speaker 0: now think don't even think of it.

394
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:05,913
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

395
00:22:06,394 --> 00:22:11,030
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go now right and if you want to cheat on the non cheating server, you may see me again.

396
00:22:19,991 --> 00:22:23,441
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day we never get tired of these.

397
00:22:23,462 --> 00:22:32,600
Speaker 1: I love it when you see middle and high school kids Elementary school kids playing football or baseball and Someone pulls the trick play.

398
00:22:32,681 --> 00:22:37,641
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the thing is right is Trick plays don't work in professional sports.

399
00:22:37,741 --> 00:22:40,170
Speaker 0: that well or pretty much ever right one.

400
00:22:40,451 --> 00:22:53,310
Speaker 1: The rules are set to where it's basically impossible to get away with that because to Anyone who's being paid to play football and that is their life and that is their career They will likely never do anything else except possibly commentate on football.

401
00:22:54,392 --> 00:22:55,817
Speaker 1: They are not going to be tricked.

402
00:22:56,179 --> 00:22:58,750
Speaker 1: that whistle blows that ball moves they're hitting someone.

403
00:22:59,571 --> 00:23:00,353
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know.

404
00:23:00,974 --> 00:23:02,618
Speaker 0: the thing is is you know?

405
00:23:02,698 --> 00:23:08,709
Speaker 0: in almost all sports right is because you know coaches know that You can trick kids.

406
00:23:09,091 --> 00:23:16,777
Speaker 0: they teach their kids to trick the other kids for example a classic thing to do in very in Little League Baseball, right a Major League Baseball someone gets a walk.

407
00:23:17,018 --> 00:23:18,605
Speaker 0: They just walk to first base and that's it.

408
00:23:19,709 --> 00:23:24,210
Speaker 0: and Pretty much Little League Baseball anything lower than minor league baseball even high school baseball.

409
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:33,641
Speaker 0: You see this sometimes when you get a walk They run the first base and if the P the other team's not paying attention Let's keep running a second and it totally works a lot of time.

410
00:23:33,721 --> 00:23:34,504
Speaker 1: nothing wrong with that.

411
00:23:34,685 --> 00:23:36,010
Speaker 0: Nothing wrong perfectly legitimate.

412
00:23:36,092 --> 00:23:36,748
Speaker 0: It's totally sweet.

413
00:23:37,292 --> 00:23:40,423
Speaker 1: It's a situation much like how Stratego major league baseball.

414
00:23:40,463 --> 00:23:43,440
Speaker 0: if you even tried that you would be out so fast It wouldn't work at all.

415
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,350
Speaker 1: Stratego a board game.

416
00:23:44,591 --> 00:23:46,057
Speaker 1: This is like the crux of one of the panels.

417
00:23:46,077 --> 00:23:49,230
Speaker 1: we used to do a pecs if you're not good at Stratego.

418
00:23:49,792 --> 00:23:54,570
Speaker 1: It is a very like tactical game and there's all these like strategies you can follow in the sub game.

419
00:23:55,011 --> 00:23:56,075
Speaker 1: That don't exist.

420
00:23:56,416 --> 00:24:01,180
Speaker 1: if you're a good player because you know better and you know, your opponent knows better You know, they won't work.

421
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,149
Speaker 1: You don't even bother with them.

422
00:24:02,531 --> 00:24:07,775
Speaker 1: it's an entirely different game with far fewer strategic options and Sports are basically the same way.

423
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:16,689
Speaker 1: if everyone's professional and athletic like good then 99% of the tricks just cannot work which is why I love this shit.

424
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:18,356
Speaker 1: What else can I say?

425
00:24:18,376 --> 00:24:25,009
Speaker 1: it's just another trick play and I wish well I don't wish we could change the rules of major league sports to allow for some of this.

426
00:24:25,631 --> 00:24:29,401
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is right is well anytime there's an optimal strategy.

427
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:34,849
Speaker 0: Everyone will converge upon, you know college football has some of this stuff Right, you know, there's some trick plays going on there.

428
00:24:35,372 --> 00:24:49,363
Speaker 0: But if you a lot if you started to you know, lax up the rules in you know Professional sports to allow, you know, make it easier to do fancy trick plays and whatever It wouldn't really work because everyone would just adapt to it and it would just.

429
00:24:49,704 --> 00:24:51,530
Speaker 0: it would just basically it would just break the game.

430
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:53,737
Speaker 1: Well, like I said, well they did anyway.

431
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:59,749
Speaker 1: ever in a sport where it matters where everyone is trying to win as hard as they Can even if no one ever cheats?

432
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:10,989
Speaker 0: Everyone will eventually converge upon an optimal solution because all Solution or random even in NFL football, but we know which is far more limited than college football and what you can do, right?

433
00:25:11,932 --> 00:25:17,228
Speaker 0: There is still a huge huge variety of things you can do in formations and plays.

434
00:25:17,268 --> 00:25:17,950
Speaker 0: you can you know.

435
00:25:17,970 --> 00:25:22,799
Speaker 0: This is really a huge, you know ceiling unlike all the different kind of plays you can try to do.

436
00:25:22,819 --> 00:25:32,800
Speaker 1: as opposed to say baseball where there is a relatively limited number of strategies and strategy most mostly in baseball comes down to What talent do you have and how do you best use?

437
00:25:32,841 --> 00:25:34,850
Speaker 0: yet in NFL football, right?

438
00:25:35,030 --> 00:25:42,650
Speaker 0: Even with all those possible things you can do there are most of the things and all know all you know They hardly ever do them because they're just a bad idea.

439
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:51,459
Speaker 0: Well, look at hot or they do them incredibly rarely because they're incredibly rarely a good idea and they'll pretty much only do them Like if it's a last-ditch effort, right?

440
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:54,330
Speaker 0: For example, did you know that in certain situations?

441
00:25:54,831 --> 00:26:00,310
Speaker 0: Even if the clock has run out you can get a free kick through the uprights to get three points, right?

442
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,596
Speaker 0: when does that happen?

443
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,094
Speaker 0: almost never because Nobody right.

444
00:26:05,677 --> 00:26:17,560
Speaker 0: you can actually do it at the half like if time runs out And a certain, you know Like and so it misses a field goal and it doesn't go out of the back of the end zone You can actually go and get the ball and start running with it.

445
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,205
Speaker 0: You know, how does that happen?

446
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:20,690
Speaker 0: hardly ever happens, right?

447
00:26:20,790 --> 00:26:25,049
Speaker 1: Well, like look at hockey that you know The trap started to dominate play and then rules change to get rid of that.

448
00:26:25,371 --> 00:26:30,607
Speaker 0: Hockey is actually the best professional sport in terms of just changing the rules immediately like that day.

449
00:26:30,747 --> 00:26:32,619
Speaker 0: if they see something stupid They just fix the rules right away.

450
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:35,612
Speaker 1: Well, they also have the wonderful Centralized adjudication.

451
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:37,398
Speaker 0: that is also an excellent.

452
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:39,544
Speaker 1: soccer could learn a thing or two from hockey.

453
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,810
Speaker 0: soccer could learn a thing or two from anything.

454
00:26:42,852 --> 00:26:47,404
Speaker 1: No, no soccer could learn a thing or two from the 21st century or the 20th century.

455
00:26:48,952 --> 00:26:52,229
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, I guess you under my thing today, perhaps.

456
00:26:52,891 --> 00:26:55,016
Speaker 0: So here's this website called inform seven.

457
00:26:55,057 --> 00:26:56,380
Speaker 0: calm and what this website is?

458
00:26:57,571 --> 00:26:59,217
Speaker 1: It's one more than inform six.

459
00:26:59,318 --> 00:27:02,229
Speaker 0: Well, you know how when you're playing action castle, right?

460
00:27:02,450 --> 00:27:10,903
Speaker 0: The computer is basically just a dick and it's like oh you said, you know get instead of pick up or you know It's very finicky much like a real text.

461
00:27:10,943 --> 00:27:12,090
Speaker 0: adventure is incredibly finicky.

462
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:15,289
Speaker 0: You have to type in the exact right command to get it to do what you want.

463
00:27:15,851 --> 00:27:18,421
Speaker 1: Actually quest for glory 2 was surprisingly lax.

464
00:27:18,501 --> 00:27:23,208
Speaker 0: Anyway, well, I mean, yeah, but it wasn't really lax It was just we put in a bunch of synonyms.

465
00:27:23,228 --> 00:27:37,109
Speaker 0: Yeah This is actually the beginnings of a system for interactive fiction, which is another way of which is the modern appropriate way of saying text adventure Novel exactly.

466
00:27:39,472 --> 00:27:43,107
Speaker 0: And basically this engine is is designed to where you can actually have the text.

467
00:27:43,147 --> 00:27:47,629
Speaker 0: adventures use Natural language as opposed to computer language, right?

468
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:56,044
Speaker 0: So you could just be like I go to the store You know, I walk around and you know and you can just type in normal stuff and you can.

469
00:27:56,104 --> 00:28:01,220
Speaker 0: actually it's it's better than Thank quest for glory or Zork.

470
00:28:01,581 --> 00:28:03,550
Speaker 1: I feel like they're two different genres.

471
00:28:04,071 --> 00:28:07,762
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know but the point is is that this is interactive fiction with natural language.

472
00:28:08,063 --> 00:28:10,310
Speaker 0: They're actually making significant real progress.

473
00:28:10,855 --> 00:28:11,541
Speaker 0: It's pretty good.

474
00:28:12,166 --> 00:28:12,529
Speaker 1: Check it out.

475
00:28:12,771 --> 00:28:13,334
Speaker 1: Well think about it.

476
00:28:13,375 --> 00:28:19,766
Speaker 1: someday we'll get to the point to where on their Kindle or Nook or whatever Someone's gonna download a novel that is basically a hyper advanced.

477
00:28:19,806 --> 00:28:20,730
Speaker 1: choose your own adventure.

478
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:25,270
Speaker 0: I think they already have those on there and actually it's way easier because you don't have to flip through looking for the page.

479
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,830
Speaker 1: Just tell you just touch your you know, go but then I can't keep my finger in all the pages and read all the deaths.

480
00:28:31,716 --> 00:28:33,390
Speaker 0: You can use the bookmark feature of the Kindle.

481
00:28:35,432 --> 00:28:37,177
Speaker 0: Even I books, but isn't that cheating?

482
00:28:37,217 --> 00:28:38,140
Speaker 1: That's like no clipping.

483
00:28:38,160 --> 00:28:41,150
Speaker 1: How is that cheating using the bookmarks to go back?

484
00:28:41,410 --> 00:28:45,284
Speaker 0: Okay, why is it cheating if there's no winning and there's no losing?

485
00:28:45,324 --> 00:28:46,287
Speaker 0: you're just reading a book.

486
00:28:46,307 --> 00:28:46,809
Speaker 0: It's like.

487
00:28:47,592 --> 00:28:52,090
Speaker 1: So maybe blizzard should shut the fuck up about people cheating in single play.

488
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:53,939
Speaker 0: It's like I buy a book.

489
00:28:54,302 --> 00:28:55,430
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read all the pages.

490
00:28:55,932 --> 00:28:57,862
Speaker 0: Well, it's cheating if you leave you skip a page.

491
00:28:57,882 --> 00:28:58,405
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

492
00:28:58,526 --> 00:28:59,330
Speaker 0: I own this whole book.

493
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:00,353
Speaker 1: Well, you just read the end.

494
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:02,420
Speaker 0: It's not like if there was a trophy.

495
00:29:02,681 --> 00:29:04,587
Speaker 0: whoever finishes the book first, but there is.

496
00:29:04,607 --> 00:29:05,610
Speaker 1: it's an achievement.

497
00:29:06,812 --> 00:29:08,124
Speaker 0: Well, you know, yeah.

498
00:29:09,211 --> 00:29:12,846
Speaker 0: Anyway, you need if you need a trophy to feel good about yourself finishing a book.

499
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:13,650
Speaker 0: You got bigger problems.

500
00:29:14,146 --> 00:29:17,325
Speaker 1: No If you need a trophy to feel good about finishing a you need to feel good about.

501
00:29:17,385 --> 00:29:22,964
Speaker 1: if you need to feel good about Ignites a self-addressed stamped envelope with $50 in it and I will send you a trophy.

502
00:29:22,984 --> 00:29:27,970
Speaker 0: I Actually, I know we're more than one trophy store is in the city.

503
00:29:28,231 --> 00:29:34,035
Speaker 1: I was looking at one of those trophy stores in Midtown because I was thinking it's probably the one I one of the ones I know might have been because I was.

504
00:29:34,196 --> 00:29:39,098
Speaker 1: I was looking at other merch to start selling and I Thought about making a trophy for smart people.

505
00:29:39,139 --> 00:29:41,690
Speaker 1: and then I decided it was a stupid idea and didn't pursue it any further.

506
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:42,273
Speaker 0: Very stupid.

507
00:29:42,293 --> 00:29:44,906
Speaker 1: We used to have the idea of doing a are you cool?

508
00:29:44,946 --> 00:29:45,730
Speaker 1: test to conventions?

509
00:29:46,113 --> 00:29:46,496
Speaker 0: We could make.

510
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:48,170
Speaker 0: we could buy the cheapest possible trophy.

511
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:50,780
Speaker 0: You know the one that they use and they just give to everybody for showing up.

512
00:29:50,961 --> 00:29:59,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, and on it we could engrave Achievement unlocked bought the cheapest room Bought myself a trophy clever girl something like that.

513
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,464
Speaker 1: No We had our old idea of the surf.

514
00:30:01,505 --> 00:30:04,680
Speaker 1: we would have Certified awesome people and you'd have you take our test.

515
00:30:04,941 --> 00:30:07,190
Speaker 1: you got to pay to take it and you get a certificate and a t-shirt.

516
00:30:07,912 --> 00:30:09,866
Speaker 1: Alright, remember that we never actually did that.

517
00:30:09,886 --> 00:30:10,350
Speaker 1: cuz we're lazy.

518
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,755
Speaker 0: I thought you were just gonna start.

519
00:30:11,795 --> 00:30:15,609
Speaker 0: we were gonna choose people that we knew that were awesome and just give out awards.

520
00:30:15,830 --> 00:30:17,017
Speaker 1: Oh, that was the geek nights.

521
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,625

522
00:30:18,645 --> 00:30:19,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need it.

523
00:30:19,490 --> 00:30:20,194
Speaker 0: We need a sword.

524
00:30:20,255 --> 00:30:21,442
Speaker 0: do that and they had to kneel before.

525
00:30:21,523 --> 00:30:22,629
Speaker 1: I don't want to give away swords.

526
00:30:22,892 --> 00:30:24,250
Speaker 0: No, no, you don't give them the sword.

Speaker 1: I have that bastard sword.

531
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,340
Speaker 0: The thing is it's gotta be real careful when you're connecting someone.

532
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:38,910
Speaker 0: cuz remember when they can they get they can niggits they're wearing armor So it goes clink clink, but if they're not more normal people don't have armor, they're wearing threadless.

533
00:30:38,930 --> 00:30:40,684
Speaker 0: You're just gonna chop their fucking arms off.

534
00:30:40,724 --> 00:30:41,450

00:32:27,611 --> 00:32:40,046
Speaker 1: I Still have to make my Tanaka mashup anyway, so When I was a lad, I remember very distinctly that we were po that we would.

563
00:32:40,086 --> 00:32:41,230
Speaker 1: now we actually quite well off.

564
00:32:41,913 --> 00:32:42,967
Speaker 1: At least we seem quite well off.

565
00:32:43,451 --> 00:32:47,750
Speaker 1: We would go with my parents to the local video rental store.

566
00:32:47,911 --> 00:32:49,738
Speaker 1: Not a chain, but a store.

567
00:32:50,099 --> 00:32:52,890
Speaker 1: and in that store, they had a VHS section and a Betamax section.

568
00:32:52,930 --> 00:33:01,770
Speaker 1: They also had a small laser disc collection in the back And I would go and I would rent one of the 10 or 11 NES games that they had.

569
00:33:02,253 --> 00:33:02,535
Speaker 0: Really?

570
00:33:02,575 --> 00:33:03,240
Speaker 0: Cuz where I was.

571
00:33:03,381 --> 00:33:04,670
Speaker 1: it was a dollar a day.

572
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:09,044
Speaker 0: We had a VHS store and they pretty much only had VHS and then it wasn't.

573
00:33:09,185 --> 00:33:18,807
Speaker 0: there weren't any other stores until Blockbusters showed up and one of the first really one of the one of the earliest Blockbusters was pretty near us and it opened up with like a crazy grand opening that was off the hook.

574
00:33:18,887 --> 00:33:20,678
Speaker 1: actually way before Blockbuster came near me.

575
00:33:20,698 --> 00:33:23,717
Speaker 0: We had mammoth video Wow And we had like a place.

576
00:33:23,757 --> 00:33:23,999
Speaker 0: that was.

577
00:33:24,019 --> 00:33:26,250
Speaker 0: there were only one of it was like video something or other.

578
00:33:26,411 --> 00:33:28,119
Speaker 1: I don't know the history for all.

579
00:33:28,522 --> 00:33:40,059
Speaker 1: I know they all like bought each other or whatever but as a kid mammoth video looked exactly like blockbuster looks now like blue awnings and everything and They gave you balloons with mammoths on them whenever you check stuff out.

580
00:33:40,561 --> 00:33:44,443
Speaker 1: and they had consoles to rent and they had NES games To rent.

581
00:33:44,485 --> 00:33:53,270
Speaker 0: Yes See the blockbuster when it opened it had the NES games But didn't have anything else and then it wasn't until later that they started to add more stuff like the console.

582
00:33:53,651 --> 00:34:02,249
Speaker 1: It is telling me other games for other system that almost none of the places I went to before the blockbuster era had any Sega games.

583
00:34:03,435 --> 00:34:04,405
Speaker 1: It was just NES.

584
00:34:04,445 --> 00:34:04,789
Speaker 1: That was it.

585
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:05,372
Speaker 0: I think it's.

586
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:13,909
Speaker 0: I just had blockbuster earlier than anyone else and they've kicked everyone else out of town because the Blockbuster that opened up was so gigantic and it opened up way early in life.

587
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:20,270
Speaker 1: Scott I just realized when we got to RIT we would watch anime on VHS tapes because no one had a DVD player.

588
00:34:20,551 --> 00:34:25,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, none of us had a DVD player or a cell phone when we got to college.

589
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:28,020
Speaker 0: Do you remember that the ps2 right when it came out?

590
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:30,570
Speaker 0: It was very popular because it also included a DVD player.

591
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:36,704
Speaker 0: I remember we tried to win one and - was released when we were at our IT it.

592
00:34:37,166 --> 00:34:38,070
Speaker 0: that's when it came out.

593
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:43,730
Speaker 0: In fact, I remember it was crazy because they did not have ps2s before we were in college.

594
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:46,580
Speaker 1: Someone brought one to the RIT anime club at a social night.

595
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:49,915
Speaker 1: We played that one launch game on it for like ever Yep.

596
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:51,768
Speaker 1: Wow, I feel really old.

597
00:34:51,929 --> 00:34:55,850
Speaker 0: But then when in a few years like everyone had one and there were Japanese ones and it was whatever.

598
00:34:55,909 --> 00:34:57,117
Speaker 1: Yep, and now RIT anime.

599
00:34:57,137 --> 00:34:58,585
Speaker 1: like no one has a VHS player.

600
00:34:58,625 --> 00:34:59,530
Speaker 1: Those tapes are all useless.

601
00:34:59,590 --> 00:35:07,070
Speaker 0: I know they still charge way too much money for the the slim one and it's still slightly troublesome to emulate.

602
00:35:08,031 --> 00:35:08,673
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah.

603
00:35:08,793 --> 00:35:12,045
Speaker 1: Anyway, so I had this whole like childhood spirits book.

604
00:35:12,065 --> 00:35:13,430
Speaker 1: Remember crystalis good game.

605
00:35:13,490 --> 00:35:22,990
Speaker 1: you know the end day in 1997 and all that and I remember that I did not own it for a long time until eventually I bought it used at Funko land.

606
00:35:23,932 --> 00:35:25,100
Speaker 0: There was a Funko land near us.

607
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,804
Speaker 0: We never went to it.

608
00:35:25,905 --> 00:35:26,670
Speaker 1: I went to it all the time.

609
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,303
Speaker 0: It was basically free arcade because it wasn't that near.

610
00:35:29,323 --> 00:35:30,227
Speaker 0: it was like an hour away.

611
00:35:30,247 --> 00:35:31,072
Speaker 0: Oh god It was.

612
00:35:31,113 --> 00:35:32,929
Speaker 0: I always saw commercials for it all the time.

613
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:37,786
Speaker 1: Yeah, I sold Final Fantasy 1 to Funko land for $25 and a year later.

614
00:35:37,826 --> 00:35:39,272
Speaker 1: I bought it back for $10.

615
00:35:39,272 --> 00:35:46,077
Speaker 0: Isn't it funny to like gay, you know Funko land is basically the GameStop business before EB, you know EB was even older than that.

616
00:35:46,218 --> 00:35:50,450
Speaker 0: Ah, but unlike GameStop EB started out as like Babbage's in more PC stuff.

617
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:58,223
Speaker 1: Yeah, see game GameStop actually showed up way late in the game Except I wouldn't buy PC games at Babbage's because they were in the mall and overpriced.

618
00:35:58,303 --> 00:36:00,030
Speaker 1: I would go to like cop USA.

619
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,576
Speaker 0: Well, you go to like software etc.

620
00:36:01,636 --> 00:36:02,761
Speaker 0: Also the software etc.

621
00:36:02,841 --> 00:36:04,628
Speaker 0: EB and Babbage's were all the same thing.

622
00:36:04,668 --> 00:36:06,947
Speaker 0: eventually Yeah, and then GameStop bought the whole thing.

623
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:08,714
Speaker 1: Media play.

624
00:36:08,754 --> 00:36:09,035
Speaker 0: it's like.

625
00:36:09,096 --> 00:36:10,240
Speaker 0: why didn't Funko land?

626
00:36:10,361 --> 00:36:12,510
Speaker 0: because it was GameStop before there was GameStop.

627
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,694
Speaker 0: Why didn't it become?

628
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:17,527
Speaker 1: because the used game market was so segmented and there wasn't enough money in it.

629
00:36:17,547 --> 00:36:20,030
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Plus parents just dropped their kids.

630
00:36:20,191 --> 00:36:25,270
Speaker 0: Funko land was obviously big enough but you know so that there was one in Michigan and in Connecticut one in Michigan.

631
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:25,934
Speaker 1: There were a ton.

632
00:36:25,955 --> 00:36:26,901
Speaker 1: They're all over the place.

633
00:36:26,941 --> 00:36:28,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're all what happened to them.

634
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:29,518
Speaker 1: They were the only game in town.

635
00:36:29,578 --> 00:36:30,846
Speaker 1: just there wasn't enough money in it.

636
00:36:31,047 --> 00:36:35,410
Speaker 1: Yeah Plus after they like the n64 like everything changed rapidly.

637
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:41,788
Speaker 1: It's amazing how much the video game landscape changed in the last 30 years because we've been playing games for almost 30 years.

638
00:36:42,651 --> 00:36:42,932
Speaker 0: Yeah,

639
00:36:43,453 --> 00:37:01,470
Speaker 1: so I'd ever owned crystallis and what I would do is, you know every couple of weeks Well, you know my parents would say hey, let's go rent a movie and of course our badge of them to let me let me rent an NES game and I would rent a game That I didn't own and take it home and play it just for that weekend and I had to bring it back on Monday.

640
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:04,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's like borrowing a game for a friend.

641
00:37:05,112 --> 00:37:07,909
Speaker 0: So, you know except you had to pay and you had to give it back right away.

642
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:13,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you couldn't really beat an NES game in three days depends on the game depends on the game.

643
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,655
Speaker 1: Most games you couldn't beat in three days.

644
00:37:15,057 --> 00:37:17,024
Speaker 1: Yeah, and did you ever rent a game more than once?

645
00:37:17,506 --> 00:37:20,337
Speaker 1: Yep, like crystallis I read it like five or six times.

646
00:37:20,457 --> 00:37:20,859
Speaker 0: I ran it.

647
00:37:20,919 --> 00:37:22,526
Speaker 0: I think fix Anna doo doo two times.

648
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:23,590
Speaker 1: Ah, thanks Anna doo.

649
00:37:24,772 --> 00:37:37,082
Speaker 1: I gave these remake but the coolest thing is they're like, I feel like there's this whole Segment of gaming like this whole world of game Experience stuff that kids today will never experience.

650
00:37:37,543 --> 00:37:42,059
Speaker 1: not necessarily great experiences at times But it's something that you just don't experience.

651
00:37:42,340 --> 00:37:43,364
Speaker 1: You don't rent games.

652
00:37:43,685 --> 00:37:45,413
Speaker 1: Let alone even if you rent games All right.

653
00:37:45,594 --> 00:37:49,033
Speaker 1: I've rented a game on a disc for my Xbox Crystallis.

654
00:37:49,053 --> 00:37:50,890
Speaker 1: when I rented it had a save game.

655
00:37:51,191 --> 00:37:55,246
Speaker 1: The guy's name was beer and he was like way leveled up and had all these items.

656
00:37:55,286 --> 00:37:56,089
Speaker 1: I'd never seen.

657
00:37:56,109 --> 00:38:02,029
Speaker 1: I Would like every time I rented a game the coolest thing was looking at the save games.

658
00:38:02,791 --> 00:38:10,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, I mean it was always, you know Even if you borrowed like your friend Zelda and you hadn't beaten Zelda yet, and it's like whoa, what's this stuff?

659
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:10,937
Speaker 0: He's got.

660
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:17,968
Speaker 0: I were like, you know Best possible stuff is when you go to the GameStop and you buy like a used copy of Pokemon or something.

661
00:38:18,008 --> 00:38:18,610
Speaker 1: Ah, there's Pokemon.

662
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:20,654
Speaker 0: Nothing beats that.

663
00:38:20,935 --> 00:38:26,453
Speaker 1: I think I followed in the footsteps of a slightly older gamer because I you know the character.

664
00:38:26,534 --> 00:38:35,785
Speaker 1: beer in Crystallis was like level 16 and like be almost beating the game and When I rented earthbound the power was beer in the save game.

665
00:38:35,805 --> 00:38:35,865
Speaker 1: Huh?

666
00:38:36,327 --> 00:38:40,901
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah Yeah, there's a whole.

667
00:38:40,941 --> 00:38:42,670
Speaker 0: you know the thing with renting games, right?

668
00:38:42,810 --> 00:38:46,645
Speaker 0: It's like basically we stopped renting games in the PlayStation era.

669
00:38:46,665 --> 00:38:53,010
Speaker 1: Well after the PlayStation one Everyone rented PlayStation games from like what red octane?

670
00:38:53,990 --> 00:39:03,430
Speaker 0: No, no back in the day remember High school my friend would go and he would rent like every PlayStation game a blockbuster copy them all no matter what the hell they.

671
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:10,805
Speaker 0: Yep, all right, and he had a mod chip and then he would return him and he basically bought every PlayStation game for like three Bucks each instead of 50 bucks each.

672
00:39:11,027 --> 00:39:16,158
Speaker 1: I did the gigantic binder of like 200 PlayStation games like our friend Kevin had.

673
00:39:16,178 --> 00:39:21,643
Speaker 0: like every ps1 game ever and it's almost every ps1 game burned them all even crappy ones That no one wanted to play.

674
00:39:21,683 --> 00:39:22,069
Speaker 0: he would get him.

675
00:39:22,150 --> 00:39:26,530
Speaker 1: Anyway, see I didn't bother with that because I used red octane which used to be just an odd.

676
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:28,157
Speaker 0: We need to do that until you get to college.

677
00:39:28,177 --> 00:39:31,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a Netflix of video games back then.

678
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:44,630
Speaker 0: Realize that red out the same red octane that eventually made DDR pads and all that stuff and I think is now part of That like a conglomerate of you know Whatever those all those companies harmonics and mad cats and whoever the fuck I don't even know anymore.

679
00:39:44,971 --> 00:39:50,230
Speaker 0: It got so convoluted, but they basically started out by being a Netflix of video games.

680
00:39:50,672 --> 00:39:52,439
Speaker 0: You know while Netflix is still very young.

681
00:39:52,459 --> 00:39:55,392
Speaker 1: but the biggest thing they had going for them is that they had a lot of import Games.

682
00:39:55,452 --> 00:40:00,417
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the reason that they made money is because of these import games Especially DDR at the height of its popularity.

683
00:40:00,457 --> 00:40:08,440
Speaker 0: So people who wanted a copy DDR could get one easily from you know From red octane and then they would burn DDR.

684
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:14,037
Speaker 0: and because I think red octane saw that DDR was like this huge Incredibly popular game that was being rented from them.

685
00:40:14,338 --> 00:40:18,390
Speaker 0: That's how they got into the DDR pad sell reselling and then making business.

686
00:40:18,835 --> 00:40:19,850
Speaker 1: I remember very distinctly.

687
00:40:19,950 --> 00:40:27,036
Speaker 1: I got my ps1 that I bought for 90 bucks at Kmart the summer after we were at RIT and I've installed my mod chip.

688
00:40:27,297 --> 00:40:27,919
Speaker 1: never used it.

689
00:40:27,939 --> 00:40:37,318
Speaker 1: I installed the mod chip before I booted it and Then I put in a game that I pirated from win MX Megaman legends, I think wow.

690
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,865
Speaker 1: Yeah, just to see if it worked.

691
00:40:39,487 --> 00:40:40,050
Speaker 1: It didn't work.

692
00:40:40,411 --> 00:40:43,563
Speaker 1: I had to open it and re solder something that I broke and then it worked.

693
00:40:43,965 --> 00:40:50,808
Speaker 1: and then red octane delivered DDR extra mix Copied it and I played DDR on that thing.

694
00:40:51,868 --> 00:40:53,814
Speaker 1: Ah It's just.

695
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:57,450
Speaker 1: I feel like video game rental is going to disappear completely with the modern.

696
00:40:57,510 --> 00:41:00,238
Speaker 0: Well, I mean there was that game tap thing, right?

697
00:41:00,318 --> 00:41:04,370
Speaker 0: Which is yeah, not really rental, but not really buying either.

698
00:41:04,612 --> 00:41:06,045
Speaker 0: It was like you pay every month.

699
00:41:06,327 --> 00:41:10,250
Speaker 0: in a way We're going you can play all these games, but anyway paying you get to stop playing.

700
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:18,016
Speaker 1: We're going back to like the old share where kind of thing where people instead of renting a game to try it out Which is the primary.

701
00:41:18,076 --> 00:41:19,281
Speaker 1: I've rented games for two reasons.

702
00:41:19,402 --> 00:41:25,330
Speaker 1: either the game wasn't good enough to buy But I wanted to play it for a weekend or I didn't know if I wanted to buy the game.

703
00:41:25,672 --> 00:41:28,370
Speaker 0: I think the two things that destroyed rental right or number one.

704
00:41:28,450 --> 00:41:34,670
Speaker 0: I already mentioned the you know, the discs being copied right but to the digital distribution.

705
00:41:34,730 --> 00:41:38,570
Speaker 0: But the digital distribution isn't what in and of itself what's hurt the rental?

706
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:42,289
Speaker 0: Although it has partially right because they still sell games on discs and whatever, right?

707
00:41:42,951 --> 00:41:49,588
Speaker 0: It's the fact that not only are they distributing the games digitally so there's nothing to rent it's you know There's no physical thing.

708
00:41:50,152 --> 00:41:53,523
Speaker 0: It's that you don't actually need to have the disc to play.

709
00:41:53,543 --> 00:41:58,182
Speaker 0: you get the disc you install it with the CD key All right, so you can't even rent that shit out.

710
00:41:58,323 --> 00:41:59,830
Speaker 0: But on top of that, right?

711
00:42:02,211 --> 00:42:07,597
Speaker 0: What happens with the digital distribution is if a game becomes old they lower the price and lower the price.

712
00:42:07,637 --> 00:42:21,035
Speaker 0: and lower the price because think about it if you if I make a game and I Sell you a copy to a store and the store rents it out a hundred times Then I only sold one copy, but really there's a whole bunch of rentals going on there And there's that.

713
00:42:21,055 --> 00:42:21,949
Speaker 0: so the store makes money.

714
00:42:22,593 --> 00:42:27,470
Speaker 0: But if I would just lower the price on the game to five bucks once it's old No one's gonna rent it from that store.

715
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:31,968
Speaker 0: They're gonna give me the maker of the game five bucks each to get the game for cheap.

716
00:42:32,188 --> 00:42:32,530
Speaker 0: on seam.

717
00:42:32,751 --> 00:42:34,629
Speaker 1: There's something I think a little more subtle, too.

718
00:42:35,292 --> 00:42:41,928
Speaker 1: I would rent any s games primarily and I rented a few SNES games And that was kind of when I stopped renting games toward the end of the SNES.

719
00:42:42,270 --> 00:42:45,642
Speaker 0: I only ever rented NES games and my friend rented PlayStation games.

720
00:42:45,682 --> 00:42:45,903
Speaker 0: I didn't.

721
00:42:45,983 --> 00:42:46,405
Speaker 0: it was weird.

722
00:42:46,425 --> 00:42:52,746
Speaker 1: I didn't rent any Genesis or Genesis selection at my blockbuster was smaller than the anime section.

723
00:42:53,188 --> 00:42:54,893
Speaker 0: Wow Ours wasn't.

724
00:42:54,953 --> 00:42:57,203
Speaker 0: but the thing was is like I had the Genesis games.

725
00:42:57,244 --> 00:42:58,630
Speaker 0: I wanted I need to rent any of them.

726
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,535
Speaker 1: I never owned a Genesis.

727
00:42:59,616 --> 00:43:01,286
Speaker 1: I rented one once for a weekend.

728
00:43:01,587 --> 00:43:03,763
Speaker 1: Yeah, huh I just there weren't that many games on the Genesis.

729
00:43:03,804 --> 00:43:04,429
Speaker 1: I wanted to play.

730
00:43:04,972 --> 00:43:12,907
Speaker 1: I sort of played all the games that were on there that I wanted to play in the NES era And the SNES era because of and this is I'm not saying this is a good thing.

731
00:43:12,947 --> 00:43:14,829
Speaker 1: Don't get me wrong I'm not on a nostalgia trip here.

732
00:43:15,831 --> 00:43:16,794
Speaker 1: The majority of them.

733
00:43:16,915 --> 00:43:23,457
Speaker 1: you could play them for a weekend and experience everything that was worth Experiencing short of fully beating them.

734
00:43:23,939 --> 00:43:27,010
Speaker 0: I think another part of the thing was that the NES days right is.

735
00:43:28,611 --> 00:43:31,160
Speaker 0: Every game is $50 and the prices on games didn't really.

736
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:32,183
Speaker 1: there were no demos.

737
00:43:32,404 --> 00:43:36,689
Speaker 0: and there were no demos except for you would Get a rare store that had like a demo system.

738
00:43:36,930 --> 00:43:42,710
Speaker 1: I remember I'd go to Meijer the supermarket every time my parents went grocery shopping and play the virtual boy while they walked around.

739
00:43:42,951 --> 00:43:48,489
Speaker 0: I played before I actually ever, you know had a chance to play super magic cards there for Super Metroid.

740
00:43:48,509 --> 00:43:54,857
Speaker 0: for real I played Super Metroid and the toys are us on a demo system, you know, and You know, so it's like if you're a kid.

741
00:43:54,917 --> 00:43:58,210
Speaker 0: you were desperate to get another game and even a crappy game was good to you.

742
00:43:58,351 --> 00:44:00,410
Speaker 1: Oh my god when my parents would take me to Toys R Us.

743
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:04,677
Speaker 1: They're like you and your brother can buy one Nintendo Nintendo game.

744
00:44:04,697 --> 00:44:11,870
Speaker 0: so four hours of us standing there staring at the games debating which one to get so That would cost you 50 bucks to get one game that you play forever.

745
00:44:11,870 --> 00:44:15,546
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if it was a new NES first party so for like Zelda to 70 bucks.

746
00:44:16,531 --> 00:44:20,670
Speaker 0: So to pay by 65 bucks five bucks for a Nintendo game for a weekend.

747
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:24,142
Speaker 0: That was amazing in those days in the late 80s early 90s.

748
00:44:24,162 --> 00:44:38,058
Speaker 1: Holy shit Yep, and I just I remember it was interesting that I would re-rent games that were good But I wasn't willing to buy them because even if I read it five times It's still half the price of buying it at Toys R Us.

749
00:44:38,359 --> 00:44:49,351
Speaker 1: Yep, especially if the game doesn't hat isn't the kind of game You need to own forever Especially now that I'm older and wiser and I have every NES rom ever and I you know going back and playing some of these Games.

750
00:44:49,371 --> 00:44:50,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, a lot of them not worth playing.

751
00:44:50,836 --> 00:44:53,706
Speaker 1: Yeah takes five seconds to figure out how shitty they are.

752
00:44:56,934 --> 00:44:57,639
Speaker 0: But see I think.

753
00:44:57,760 --> 00:45:09,629
Speaker 0: part of it though, is that like Some take a game like Kung Fu Heroes, for example, right if I just rented that game It would have been like I return it right or if I would you know, if I load it up in an emulator.

754
00:45:09,669 --> 00:45:13,502
Speaker 0: now It's like whatever but because I own that game and I did own that game.

755
00:45:13,522 --> 00:45:19,601
Speaker 0: All right, I might still have the carcass somewhere Because I own that game and I had it for Evers.

756
00:45:20,283 --> 00:45:26,164
Speaker 0: I actually put a lot more into it You know because I paid whatever for it was the one game that I got.

757
00:45:26,184 --> 00:45:27,850
Speaker 0: I was gonna play the fuck out of it.

758
00:45:27,951 --> 00:45:33,701
Speaker 0: And because I played the fuck out of it I actually dug deep on it and I sort of discovered more.

759
00:45:33,742 --> 00:45:42,510
Speaker 0: that was in that game because I had more of a Investment and a reason to go for it, you know, whereas nowadays You could just you're so many games.

760
00:45:42,992 --> 00:45:47,030
Speaker 0: There's no reason to try to extract all the goodness out of any game.

761
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:51,187
Speaker 0: But in those days if a game had anything good in it, you would have to work hard to.

762
00:45:51,709 --> 00:45:55,623
Speaker 0: you know Get every last, you know Drop of water out of that's.

763
00:45:55,703 --> 00:45:59,983
Speaker 1: you know, damp rag You only had so many games in the first place.

764
00:46:00,083 --> 00:46:06,970
Speaker 1: I know right but I Maybe this explains because like you're really good at Megaman - I'm really good at bionic commando.

765
00:46:07,371 --> 00:46:13,950
Speaker 1: I really like Megaman - and you like bionic commando, but you owned a Megaman - I owned bionic commando.

766
00:46:14,090 --> 00:46:15,437
Speaker 1: I only rented Megaman -.

767
00:46:15,477 --> 00:46:22,817
Speaker 0: the thing is when I got my Nintendo, of course day one I had Mario Duck on right day - Megaman - I see the game.

768
00:46:22,857 --> 00:46:26,249
Speaker 1: the first games I got were Castlevania 1 and Castlevania 2.

769
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:31,619
Speaker 0: first game I got Megaman - Mario Duck Hunt after Mario Duck Hunt, obviously Yeah, Mario Duck Hunt Megaman - but it was.

770
00:46:31,719 --> 00:46:33,910
Speaker 1: it was all I was all about the Castlevania.

771
00:46:34,251 --> 00:46:35,595
Speaker 0: I picked the winner right away.

772
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:37,260
Speaker 1: Simon's Quest is one of the first games.

773
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:39,908
Speaker 0: I beat shortly after that Zelda 1.

774
00:46:39,908 --> 00:46:48,963
Speaker 1: Oh my god I just had this like weird nostalgia flashback to holding that gold cartridge before I put it in the first time and then Hanukkah after it came out.

775
00:46:49,245 --> 00:46:51,072
Speaker 0: Mario 3.

776
00:46:51,072 --> 00:46:53,050
Speaker 1: I bought Zelda 2 before Mario 3.

777
00:46:53,050 --> 00:46:55,958
Speaker 0: My mom put the Mario 3 in a Macy's box So it looked like it was closed.

778
00:46:55,979 --> 00:46:57,450
Speaker 0: and then I opened it up and inside the tissue paper.

779
00:46:57,450 --> 00:47:01,826
Speaker 1: I think every Nintendo game I ever got came in a Macy's box or some equivalent inside tissue paper.

780
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,252
Speaker 0: Mario 3.

781
00:47:03,252 --> 00:47:06,745
Speaker 1: I just remember I had to choose my brother and I. one of the hardest decisions we ever had to make.

782
00:47:07,186 --> 00:47:11,921
Speaker 1: our choices were Buy Zelda 2 or buy Mario 3.

783
00:47:11,921 --> 00:47:13,907
Speaker 0: Can't go wrong with Mario 3 is the obvious winner.

784
00:47:13,927 --> 00:47:14,832
Speaker 1: No, we got Zelda 2.

785
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:15,788
Speaker 0: It's not like you couldn't go wrong.

786
00:47:16,131 --> 00:47:20,970
Speaker 0: Same thing as I. I did get Zelda 2 on a gray cartridge actually not gold.

787
00:47:21,231 --> 00:47:21,914
Speaker 1: I got old.

788
00:47:22,034 --> 00:47:24,485
Speaker 0: I had played Zelda 2 prior to purchasing.

789
00:47:24,505 --> 00:47:25,710
Speaker 0: so I knew that it was different.

790
00:47:25,992 --> 00:47:27,602
Speaker 0: So I knew that Mario 3 was like safe bet.

791
00:47:28,689 --> 00:47:32,111
Speaker 0: I Mean you couldn't really go wrong with Mario 3.

792
00:47:32,111 --> 00:47:34,661
Speaker 0: I mean that game sold like at the time.

793
00:47:34,721 --> 00:47:37,210
Speaker 0: that was like the most selling is thing ever.

794
00:47:37,716 --> 00:47:38,729
Speaker 1: There was just I don't know there.

795
00:47:39,491 --> 00:47:43,850
Speaker 1: Games had a very different feeling back when you couldn't didn't have access to game facts or anything.

796
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:47,048
Speaker 1: So you'd rent a game and you got a game magazine?

797
00:47:47,249 --> 00:47:51,564
Speaker 1: Oh Usually that game didn't come with instructions because the blockbuster didn't have him anymore.

798
00:47:51,584 --> 00:47:53,510
Speaker 1: You just got this like Robocop game.

799
00:47:53,530 --> 00:47:54,494
Speaker 1: You did not have played.

800
00:47:54,775 --> 00:47:56,202
Speaker 1: you had two days to play.

801
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:57,166
Speaker 1: the fuck out of it.

802
00:47:57,427 --> 00:47:58,130
Speaker 1: So you didn't go outside.

803
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:00,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no Internet's to get help from.

804
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,410
Speaker 0: yeah, you could pay money for the Nintendo hotline.

805
00:48:03,510 --> 00:48:07,226
Speaker 0: But even as a kid, I was smart enough to never pay money anything over the phone.

806
00:48:07,286 --> 00:48:07,628
Speaker 0: No 900 numbers.

807
00:48:08,250 --> 00:48:13,550
Speaker 1: I sent a letter to Nintendo Power once and they didn't feature my question, but they sent me an answer back.

808
00:48:13,631 --> 00:48:14,869
Speaker 0: I think I sent a letter to GamePro.

809
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:23,296
Speaker 0: The only thing I ever fell for and I sort of knew it was a scam when I was falling for it was the pandemonium contest, ah I was a really.

810
00:48:23,397 --> 00:48:29,538
Speaker 1: I was like desperately obsessed with the Nintendo Power contest Because they always gave away crazy stuff like stormtrooper helmet.

811
00:48:29,558 --> 00:48:31,283
Speaker 0: that got the pandemonium contest.

812
00:48:31,323 --> 00:48:33,067
Speaker 0: was I vaguely so?

813
00:48:33,087 --> 00:48:43,924
Speaker 0: basically in the in the game pro Magazine there was his advertisement every month and the advertiser it would be solve this puzzle and mail it in You know and pay with a dollar or whatever and you could win this.

814
00:48:44,084 --> 00:48:58,890
Speaker 0: and it showed you the most ludicrous shit You'd ever seen which at the time was like a 50-inch rear projection TV and a satellite dish and every game Console and a surround sound stereo system and a pile of games and even a neogeo was in there.

815
00:48:58,950 --> 00:49:05,370
Speaker 0: It was you know, everything Sega Genesis with a 32x and a CD and a Sega CD and a Super Nintendo and everything, right?

816
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:09,330
Speaker 0: It's like you could win all these things, you know, if you solve these puzzles.

817
00:49:09,692 --> 00:49:13,590
Speaker 0: So I solved the puzzle and mailed it in and then they sent you another puzzle, which is harder.

818
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:20,089
Speaker 0: So I solved the puzzle and mailed it in with five bucks and then I and I solved the puzzle and mailed it in with Five bucks and there were five puzzles.

819
00:49:20,471 --> 00:49:28,742
Speaker 0: so obviously I mailed in the fourth puzzle and then I got the fifth puzzle and the fifth puzzle was the hardest puzzle of All and without a computer I couldn't solve it.

820
00:49:29,345 --> 00:49:31,435
Speaker 0: come, you know with the it was basically Uh, it was.

821
00:49:31,535 --> 00:49:34,270
Speaker 0: it wasn't a puzzle where there is a solution and there isn't a solution.

822
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:41,120
Speaker 0: It was get the most points you can get and obviously to make the most money possible you ought to always pass all the rounds until the last round.

823
00:49:41,641 --> 00:49:46,132
Speaker 0: and then I mailed in the last round with the subpar solution and Did not?

824
00:49:46,253 --> 00:49:50,528
Speaker 0: you know, I paid like 25 bucks and did not win a giant mound of awesomeness.

825
00:49:50,648 --> 00:49:56,034
Speaker 1: Hey listeners We have a trivia contest starting if you mail us five bucks Yeah with every.

826
00:49:56,054 --> 00:50:03,410
Speaker 0: you have to mail five bucks with every answer and then if all your answers are right Then you have a will randomly select from all the people who get the fifth answer, right?

827
00:50:03,830 --> 00:50:04,617
Speaker 1: What was interesting?

828
00:50:04,637 --> 00:50:06,190
Speaker 1: just to get back to the the topic?

829
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:17,410
Speaker 1: Toward the end of the SNES era the local blockbusters at least by me started doing Tournaments and they had yeah, I mean blockbuster, you know after Toys R Us blockbuster was the gaming place.

830
00:50:18,072 --> 00:50:23,950
Speaker 1: Like it was a hangout you would go and hang out there playing games with other people because they had a game demo machine.

831
00:50:24,134 --> 00:50:31,273
Speaker 0: You know They had consoles and when it was there were big tournaments that they would have there plus all the kids in the neighborhood went to The same blockbuster.

832
00:50:32,056 --> 00:50:36,030
Speaker 0: Toys R Us were only interested in selling games, you know, and they had demo units.

833
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:39,965
Speaker 0: But blockbusters actually tried to you know, get some gaming going on.

834
00:50:40,587 --> 00:50:41,350
Speaker 0: It was kind of interesting.

835
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:43,499
Speaker 0: It was kind of half-assed that too.

836
00:50:43,519 --> 00:50:49,146
Speaker 0: Well, I mean most of the problem right it I always notice with that kind of thing is like the in the marketing for it.

837
00:50:49,166 --> 00:50:51,697
Speaker 0: They'll be like, alright This is gonna be a blockbuster tournament.

838
00:50:51,777 --> 00:50:57,881
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right, but then you went to your local blockbuster and it was like There's like five people standing there.

839
00:50:57,921 --> 00:50:59,350
Speaker 1: It's kind of like a false star.

840
00:50:59,490 --> 00:51:03,650
Speaker 1: They're like, alright you two play Mortal Kombat and whoever wins will play against this guy.

841
00:51:04,831 --> 00:51:10,792
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they because we all saw the wizard and we thought every video game tournament was exactly like yeah It's like they.

842
00:51:10,872 --> 00:51:17,330
Speaker 0: the way they present it to you is they act like it's gonna be a real deal Like it's gonna be something amazing and awesome and perfect and power.

843
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:26,970
Speaker 1: It's just like my thing of the day from last week of video power Where you see those kids who clearly have seen behind the veil and realized that nothing is ever going.

844
00:51:27,392 --> 00:51:29,422
Speaker 1: I think it was awesome as the wizard made it seem.

845
00:51:29,523 --> 00:51:31,813
Speaker 0: I think of it more like a CCG tournament.

846
00:51:31,854 --> 00:51:32,496
Speaker 0: right you look.

847
00:51:32,898 --> 00:51:36,719
Speaker 0: if you go and look at like CCG tournaments or pictures of them online It's like all.

848
00:51:36,739 --> 00:51:43,710
Speaker 0: look at these tournaments Whoa, but then if you go to like your local game shop and they're playing Yu-Gi-Oh, it's like our kids is Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

849
00:51:45,371 --> 00:51:45,974
Speaker 0: Play a game.

850
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:49,447
Speaker 0: It's kind of coke is gonna kick IRS vanilla coke to be fair.

851
00:51:49,548 --> 00:51:58,950
Speaker 1: Yeah That's alright, but my favorite part of all this was finding the save games like that Specific thing I feel is lost forever.

852
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:00,297
Speaker 1: I almost there.

853
00:52:00,638 --> 00:52:05,498
Speaker 1: I want to make a game cuz I'm playing that retro game Challenge whatever on the DS that Scott is also playing.

854
00:52:05,518 --> 00:52:13,743
Speaker 1: That's a good game and it tries to recreate these Experiences by having like video game magazines for it's made up game.

855
00:52:13,783 --> 00:52:14,746
Speaker 1: It totally works.

856
00:52:14,846 --> 00:52:16,230
Speaker 0: It totally works - it's great.

857
00:52:16,451 --> 00:52:22,108
Speaker 1: So you get to experience the fun parts of the 80s and 90s without having to go through the bullshit of the 80s and 90s.

858
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:23,272
Speaker 0: Well, that's because they have.

859
00:52:23,352 --> 00:52:35,070
Speaker 0: the games that they've made right is are basically faux NES games, right and what they've done Is they you know, they're in the style of old NES games, but they had modern people made them.

860
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,138
Speaker 0: They're actually polished, you know, modernly.

861
00:52:37,178 --> 00:52:40,070
Speaker 0: so the controls aren't fucked up and they're not unfairly hard.

862
00:52:40,110 --> 00:52:46,630
Speaker 0: They're just normal hard if they're hard at all, you know, and it's just the graphics and the styling and the game.

863
00:52:46,911 --> 00:52:52,070
Speaker 0: You know the gameplay mechanics are retro, but you know the polish and the craft is modern.

864
00:52:52,211 --> 00:52:55,967
Speaker 0: So it's not like yeah people it's not like that guy didn't even touch me.

865
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:56,690
Speaker 0: Why did I die?

866
00:52:56,690 --> 00:52:57,835
Speaker 0: You don't have that bullshit going on.

867
00:52:58,116 --> 00:53:01,130
Speaker 1: we and a lot of video game commentators often get criticized.

868
00:53:01,130 --> 00:53:06,790
Speaker 0: It's like it's like if everything the AVGN yelled at a video game was fixed, but it was still the same game.

869
00:53:07,351 --> 00:53:08,775
Speaker 1: I don't know for Cheetah Man.

870
00:53:08,795 --> 00:53:09,818
Speaker 1: That wouldn't be anything.

871
00:53:10,039 --> 00:53:19,990
Speaker 1: I'm just saying more for like, you know, Jekyll and Hyde Like Silver Surfer, but the common criticism we get is that we have this like fetish for old games.

872
00:53:20,694 --> 00:53:23,630
Speaker 1: We are fully aware that it sucked back then.

873
00:53:23,770 --> 00:53:31,797
Speaker 1: We don't want to go back to those terrible days, but there were specific small experiences that were good.

874
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:34,887
Speaker 1: that cannot be replicated in the modern gaming world and we have to.

875
00:53:34,927 --> 00:53:43,728
Speaker 1: I want to find a way to replicate that the experience of playing a game where you have no access to outside information about it in it per se at least not easy access.

876
00:53:43,829 --> 00:53:54,467
Speaker 1: or you choose not to access it and You can experience like that strange Exploration of finding a save game that has way more stuff than your guy like he has items.

877
00:53:54,487 --> 00:53:55,330
Speaker 1: You don't even know what they do.

878
00:53:55,712 --> 00:53:58,383
Speaker 0: I don't know how you can possibly do the no outside information.

879
00:53:58,444 --> 00:53:59,870
Speaker 0: The internet makes that sort of impossible.

880
00:54:00,251 --> 00:54:06,730
Speaker 1: Here's one way like the forest in in Mario 64 you have procedurally generated games.

881
00:54:07,891 --> 00:54:13,970
Speaker 1: What if you had a retro game challenge that made games and codes up in a non easily predictable manner?

882
00:54:14,717 --> 00:54:17,970
Speaker 0: It's possible but Theoretically, but and it's not realistic.

883
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:18,773
Speaker 1: but no it's not.

884
00:54:18,813 --> 00:54:22,424
Speaker 0: well you could do though is I think Minecraft really needs to get on this?

885
00:54:22,585 --> 00:54:26,378
Speaker 0: is we already have the ability to Save games in the cloud?

886
00:54:26,498 --> 00:54:28,606
Speaker 0: quote right like on Steam or save right?

887
00:54:28,626 --> 00:54:29,650
Speaker 0: You can save your game.

888
00:54:29,670 --> 00:54:30,628
Speaker 1: We need shared save games.

889
00:54:31,091 --> 00:54:35,124
Speaker 0: You can save your game on some server in the sky and that way you don't.

890
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:37,413
Speaker 0: if your computer gets wiped out your save game Is safe.

891
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:39,129
Speaker 1: I should be able to share my save game with anyone.

892
00:54:39,331 --> 00:54:43,170
Speaker 0: Yeah, well no Eve what you could do is you can artificially shuffle up the save game.

893
00:54:43,190 --> 00:54:47,710
Speaker 0: So I play my game and I save and then I go to load and my games not there.

894
00:54:48,192 --> 00:54:49,519
Speaker 0: I have someone else's save game.

895
00:54:49,559 --> 00:54:51,207
Speaker 0: I don't have my save game named penis.

896
00:54:51,247 --> 00:54:55,442
Speaker 0: You're safe So penis or and you're yeah, your save game is now gone.

897
00:54:55,542 --> 00:54:56,385
Speaker 0: Someone else has it.

898
00:54:56,425 --> 00:55:00,714
Speaker 0: you have someone else's save game So it's like whoa Or.

899
00:55:00,774 --> 00:55:02,670
Speaker 1: yeah, there are a bunch of ways you could go about it.

900
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:18,950
Speaker 1: But there was an interesting idea of exploring a game where you could look at the save game and he's got items You don't understand what they do and because blockbuster didn't have the manual like no one knew what they did and you had no way To find out short of either playing to that point or starting this scary save game in the weird part of the world.

901
00:55:19,891 --> 00:55:24,490
Speaker 0: Another thing you could do right is if you had a game that just had so many different aspects, right?

902
00:55:24,690 --> 00:55:29,910
Speaker 0: So say for an example, you had an MMO and in the MMO all these different characters did different things, right?

903
00:55:30,751 --> 00:55:35,010
Speaker 0: So it's like a you know, a crafting guy and a fighting guy an explorer guy, right?

904
00:55:35,330 --> 00:55:37,804
Speaker 0: And each one is actually a drastically different game.

905
00:55:37,844 --> 00:55:41,510
Speaker 0: that are all good games But when you sign on it's like you don't have a character.

906
00:55:42,051 --> 00:55:51,319
Speaker 0: You're just gonna be assigned somewhere and if there's enough different characters right with it in enough different places in enough different games It's like you don't know what you're gonna get when you play this thing.

907
00:55:51,339 --> 00:55:56,929
Speaker 0: and it'd be really it would take quite a long time For them to document it all in some sort of wiki, but it'll happen.

908
00:55:57,090 --> 00:56:01,204
Speaker 1: I mean look at the advanced wars or even the emerging Civ 5 game facts.

909
00:56:01,546 --> 00:56:09,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's no way around that No, but I mean it'll just take a while and even if it even if people look up the information It's still you don't know what you're gonna get when you sign it.

910
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:16,202
Speaker 1: I guess the only moral of this is like I said This is an aspect of gaming that is basically gone.

911
00:56:16,262 --> 00:56:25,750
Speaker 1: the experiences that we had growing up And I'm sure people who played the Atari era have similar Well, no, I know they did have similar things that we didn't even have the ability to replicate.

912
00:56:27,271 --> 00:56:42,630
Speaker 1: Until gaming converges in the future like every generation will have such a unique experience just by the fact of how fast gaming is evolving That there will always be this kind of weird lagging nostalgia That's just going to be increasingly affecting the way games are made and played.

913
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:44,178
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it's even worse right?

914
00:56:44,218 --> 00:56:48,582
Speaker 0: think about some of the stuff that they had in different Countries or things that were so expensive to have them.

915
00:56:48,603 --> 00:56:48,764
Speaker 0: right.

916
00:56:48,784 --> 00:56:49,870
Speaker 0: remember there was a Sega Channel.

917
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:50,735
Speaker 0: You know what the Sega Channel?

918
00:56:51,097 --> 00:56:53,249
Speaker 1: I know about it because I've read a Wikipedia about it.

919
00:56:53,370 --> 00:57:00,376
Speaker 0: Sega Channel was basically you got this cartridge that goes in your Genesis and you hope that your cable provider Yes your cable television provider supported it.

920
00:57:00,737 --> 00:57:04,770
Speaker 0: then you would take your cable television connect it to your Sega Genesis cartridge.

921
00:57:04,790 --> 00:57:06,214
Speaker 0: that Was the Sega Channel cartridge.

922
00:57:06,815 --> 00:57:10,566
Speaker 0: turn your TV to a certain channel and then you could actually play games.

923
00:57:10,606 --> 00:57:11,910
Speaker 0: that came in over the cable.

924
00:57:12,354 --> 00:57:14,772
Speaker 0: But that wasn't all in Japan.

925
00:57:14,793 --> 00:57:18,630
Speaker 0: now yes, Zelda they had BS Zelda, which is a satellite.

926
00:57:19,031 --> 00:57:22,624
Speaker 1: I thought that was a prank for the longest time is a real deal.

927
00:57:22,745 --> 00:57:24,130
Speaker 1: Oh because as a kid there were rumors.

928
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:25,014
Speaker 1: There were two rumors.

929
00:57:25,034 --> 00:57:28,610
Speaker 0: there are ROMs of it that you can play but they're nothing like the real thing.

930
00:57:28,650 --> 00:57:33,005
Speaker 0: They're missing significant features because you just can't replicate the satellite system.

931
00:57:33,145 --> 00:57:35,304
Speaker 1: There was I mean the two rumors I remember as a kid.

932
00:57:35,528 --> 00:57:38,479
Speaker 1: one I knew the truth because I'd played a Phillips was the.

933
00:57:38,961 --> 00:57:40,506
Speaker 1: there's all these other Zelda games.

934
00:57:40,667 --> 00:57:42,812
Speaker 1: one of them you play Zelda That's true.

935
00:57:43,152 --> 00:57:45,860
Speaker 1: Yep, and the other one was there's this special Zelda.

936
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,665
Speaker 1: You'll never get called BS Zelda.

937
00:57:47,725 --> 00:57:49,350
Speaker 1: I was like BS, Zelda.

938
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:51,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, sounds like bullshit.

939
00:57:51,111 --> 00:58:01,953
Speaker 0: So but no BS Zelda is totally real and it was a Zelda game that came out in Japan that was in the same style of Zelda 1 With different maps and different everything, but it was a game that had a time Element to it.

940
00:58:01,993 --> 00:58:03,619
Speaker 0: like it was a real time Zelda.

941
00:58:03,639 --> 00:58:07,412
Speaker 0: you had to get through in a certain number of minutes and such and you.

942
00:58:07,432 --> 00:58:13,980
Speaker 0: basically it worked because the game was hooked up to a satellite system and you had to tune into the game at a Certain time when the game was being played.

943
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,073
Speaker 1: as Xbox Live needs to get on that shit You couldn't.

944
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:16,961
Speaker 0: just well they had that.

945
00:58:17,021 --> 00:58:19,053
Speaker 0: they have one versus yeah But they need more.

946
00:58:19,133 --> 00:58:29,471
Speaker 1: imagine if or Nintendo even canceled one versus 100. imagine if every week or every month there was a war a worldwide WarioWare Wernemann's.

947
00:58:29,712 --> 00:58:31,500
Speaker 0: they had one versus 100 on Xbox.

948
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:33,388
Speaker 0: Yeah, they tried that shit and it's gone now.

949
00:58:33,428 --> 00:58:33,830
Speaker 1: that sucks.

950
00:58:33,991 --> 00:58:37,066
Speaker 1: That was in an entire avenue of gaming we could bring back.

951
00:58:37,508 --> 00:58:42,090
Speaker 0: but now Yeah, I definitely think that you know, everyone played the game at this time.

952
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:47,304
Speaker 0: This is when the game is on is definitely pretty cool And I think one versus 100 is actually flawed.

953
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:50,298
Speaker 0: and that it was only versus 100 Why wasn't it one verse the entire world?

954
00:58:50,941 --> 00:58:52,708
Speaker 0: You know, why not let everyone get in on it?

955
00:58:53,471 --> 00:58:54,596
Speaker 0: Why keep some people out?

956
00:58:54,797 --> 00:58:57,368
Speaker 0: No reason, you know, you could tell the computers can handle it.

957
00:58:57,508 --> 00:59:00,308
Speaker 0: It'd be alright And that would actually be an MMO.

958
00:59:06,283 --> 00:59:08,820
