1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,480
Speaker 0: 

2
00:00:09,221 --> 00:00:13,270
Speaker 1: It's Monday October 3rd 2016.

3
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:19,640
Speaker 1: I'm rim Scott and this is geek nights tonight disposing of old technology.

4
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:22,796
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,403 --> 00:00:28,718
Speaker 1: So I was on a boat the other night.

6
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:34,220
Speaker 1: Yeah on the other side It was one of you know those party boats that you see going up and down the river in New York sometimes.

7
00:00:34,562 --> 00:00:35,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was on one of those.

8
00:00:35,888 --> 00:00:39,046
Speaker 0: I mean we were on one of those when we went to see the joke Oh concert.

9
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:43,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I was also on one of those when Judith had her bachelorette party.

10
00:00:43,247 --> 00:00:49,610
Speaker 0: I mean they seem to be like an in ex relatively inexpensive, but Moderate party situation that you know.

11
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:53,670
Speaker 0: if you're in New York you're gonna end up on that boat a few times If you're here long enough, I remember one time.

12
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:54,193
Speaker 1: You know we did.

13
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:55,520
Speaker 1: we went for Judith's thing.

14
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,463
Speaker 1: We went to the boat.

15
00:00:56,583 --> 00:01:00,054
Speaker 1: our boat was technically a Hall and Oates tribute band boat.

16
00:01:00,375 --> 00:01:02,081
Speaker 0: was there actually a Hall and Oates tribute band On it?

17
00:01:02,202 --> 00:01:05,736
Speaker 1: yes, and they performed for the entire boat ride, and we didn't.

18
00:01:05,796 --> 00:01:06,780
Speaker 0: I mean Hall and Oates isn't bad?

19
00:01:06,862 --> 00:01:08,824
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the music was fine But no one gave a shit about them.

20
00:01:08,904 --> 00:01:16,979
Speaker 1: so like the inside of the boat where they were performing was literally empty and everyone was outside in the beautiful weather Listening to the music piped up so they were playing to an empty room.

21
00:01:17,623 --> 00:01:21,587
Speaker 1: I felt a little bad, but and but while we were getting on the Hall and Oates boat I mean I was this weekend.

22
00:01:21,607 --> 00:01:26,898
Speaker 0: I was at like the tiniest Country fair and you know welcome to our country.

23
00:01:26,938 --> 00:01:30,175
Speaker 0: home Local business has a table place.

24
00:01:30,457 --> 00:01:36,917
Speaker 0: yeah There were bands playing to nothing Except like an old person standing there and a kid running around in a circle.

25
00:01:36,937 --> 00:01:43,140
Speaker 1: yeah So uh man bad weather didn't help them when we got on the Holland but Hall and Oates boat way back.

26
00:01:43,281 --> 00:01:49,837
Speaker 1: I remember that as we were getting on our boat There was a boat next to us that was also loading and that boat looked like a much better boat.

27
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:51,884
Speaker 0: because that boat Boat you listen.

28
00:01:51,965 --> 00:01:54,473
Speaker 0: whenever you get on one of these boats the boat next to you is always.

29
00:01:54,493 --> 00:02:02,208
Speaker 0: in that case unless you're the rich Person with the big is why the rich people who do the yacht thing try to have the biggest yacht And don't like.

30
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:02,955
Speaker 0: what's the guy's name?

31
00:02:02,975 --> 00:02:03,479
Speaker 0: Paul Allen?

32
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:09,759
Speaker 0: He always kept trying to make his yacht bigger and bigger and bigger and he'd buy bigger ones That way whenever he was pulling out.

33
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:15,459
Speaker 0: He wouldn't have like some Bill Gates or someone with a bigger yacht next to him He would always be pulling out in the biggest boat.

34
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,667
Speaker 1: But so basically I remember that time.

35
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:27,340
Speaker 1: the other boat it was interesting cuz our boat for the Hall and Oates tribute band was Pretty much 90% like white people all dressed the same way.

36
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:35,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other boat was no white people and everybody was dressed real fashion nice.

37
00:02:35,421 --> 00:02:38,954
Speaker 1: And the music coming out of that boat sounded like the opposite of Hall and Oates.

38
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:43,113
Speaker 1: and it was like that boat went off into The distance and we were thinking about jumping for it.

39
00:02:43,315 --> 00:02:44,139
Speaker 0: I would have jumped for it.

40
00:02:45,661 --> 00:02:46,946
Speaker 0: How far how far was a jump?

41
00:02:47,407 --> 00:02:50,036
Speaker 1: so the boat that time it's a parkour on.

42
00:02:50,478 --> 00:02:51,640
Speaker 1: so this other time We're on this boat.

43
00:02:52,122 --> 00:03:01,479
Speaker 0: If you land if there's a party boat and you arrive on that party boat by jumping from an adjacent party boat You're the only officially the life of the party unless you're the party frog.

44
00:03:02,621 --> 00:03:14,100
Speaker 1: So, but I remember when we got back that other boat got back around the same time and There was this weird walk of shame down the gangplank where like every basically normal people were walking off the boat.

45
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,357
Speaker 1: They were fine, but like every 20 or 30 people they were.

46
00:03:18,437 --> 00:03:30,684
Speaker 1: almost invariably It was always a woman wearing like four inch heels who was too drunk to walk Trying to make their way down the gang playing to fall off that gang playing and they're like falling off of each other and it Was like such a thing.

47
00:03:30,744 --> 00:03:31,407
Speaker 1: It was kind of funny.

48
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,395
Speaker 1: But on this other boat, we were on a party boat.

49
00:03:33,455 --> 00:03:34,239
Speaker 1: same deal hanging out.

50
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:37,860
Speaker 1: There's fine boat time and the boat gets back and we're getting off the boat.

51
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:39,226
Speaker 1: We get off the boat right away.

52
00:03:39,246 --> 00:03:46,829
Speaker 1: And then as we're standing there waiting for the rest of our friends to all get off the boat the Shame walk of the drunk people was there again.

53
00:03:46,929 --> 00:03:55,940
Speaker 1: and because we stood there while all the drunk people got off the boat I got to see in the fullness of that situation and I think that this happens every time there's a party boat.

54
00:03:56,141 --> 00:03:58,780
Speaker 1: There's a surprising number of people who drink so much on these boats.

55
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:01,435
Speaker 1: They cannot get off of the boat under their own power.

56
00:04:01,455 --> 00:04:06,335
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I don't know what happens to those people after they do get off the boat because the boat is

57
00:04:06,355 --> 00:04:09,391
Speaker 0: long as they don't drive home And they take a subway or a cab because the boat

58
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:10,760
Speaker 1: people help them get off the boat

59
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,911
Speaker 0: They barf in the back of an uber or something, but they do

60
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,520
Speaker 1: not help them after that point.

61
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:18,276
Speaker 1: So I watched this one dude stagger down the gang playing like gaining momentum.

62
00:04:18,315 --> 00:04:28,710
Speaker 1: the whole time He gets to the bottom and just kind of keeps going straight and then bumps into the wall That was like 15 feet away from the water Mm-hmm, and then just stands there and does not move.

63
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,156
Speaker 1: and he was still standing there when we left.

64
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:30,839
Speaker 0: Oh, he's standing.

65
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:31,160
Speaker 0: That's good.

66
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:32,384
Speaker 1: No, I don't.

67
00:04:32,404 --> 00:04:34,813
Speaker 1: maybe he knocked himself out, but he was just like propped up against the wall.

68
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,927
Speaker 1: I couldn't quite tell that's fine There's a good boat.

69
00:04:37,947 --> 00:04:40,080
Speaker 0: He wasn't moving into the road or something, you know, yeah.

70
00:04:41,201 --> 00:04:44,879
Speaker 0: So I think if like a drunk guy, you know, if you see a drunk person you just ignore them.

71
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:52,969
Speaker 0: But if you see, you know a drunk person like stumbling about randomly and they're near a road You kind of have to call through on one.

72
00:04:53,009 --> 00:04:59,620
Speaker 1: maybe yeah a couple of times in my life I've steered someone who was drunk away because it's like you don't want to go from walking into the subway track.

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you don't want to go near them because they might barf on you or fight you or something.

74
00:05:03,682 --> 00:05:08,418
Speaker 0: But you also you don't want them to die just getting hit by a car because by stumbling into the road.

75
00:05:08,438 --> 00:05:16,679
Speaker 1: Yep So the other thing that happened to me that was kind of interesting is I got this device and I asked you earlier You know, I pointed out I was gonna talk about it.

76
00:05:17,262 --> 00:05:22,720
Speaker 1: It might look like a battery but it's actually a power adapter to charge an LG device of some kind.

77
00:05:22,902 --> 00:05:24,460
Speaker 0: It's a it's a USB charger.

78
00:05:24,540 --> 00:05:30,500
Speaker 0: It has two prongs for power at one end at least in the United States and it has USB hole on the other end.

79
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:31,645
Speaker 0: It's kind of boring.

80
00:05:31,786 --> 00:05:32,569
Speaker 0: What's what's the big?

81
00:05:32,589 --> 00:05:35,120
Speaker 1: So the prongs are bent quite dramatic.

82
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:35,280
Speaker 1: The

83
00:05:35,341 --> 00:05:51,483
Speaker 0: prongs are bent out like ears like ones pointing to the left of ones pointing to the right like somebody took pliers and made It this shape to make like a cute little like you were making like you can be a little toy out of it Put two googly eyes on it and draw a little mouth and use some pipe cleaners to make arms and legs and you have like A cute little guy.

84
00:05:51,503 --> 00:05:54,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I did take pliers and do that yesterday.

85
00:05:54,155 --> 00:05:55,240
Speaker 1: And that is why I like that.

86
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:56,004
Speaker 0: Why did you do that?

87
00:05:56,265 --> 00:06:09,303
Speaker 1: So we were watching TV and I'm laying there and I hear this noise like this heavy vibrating buzzing noise like like Like hypnotoad.

88
00:06:09,846 --> 00:06:11,212
Speaker 1: Mmm, so but it's I like.

89
00:06:11,313 --> 00:06:14,872
Speaker 1: I'd heard it off and on throughout the day But there's a lot of construction outside our building.

90
00:06:14,892 --> 00:06:16,140
Speaker 1: So I kind of just chalked it up to that.

91
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:24,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then I'm sitting there and is like really bothering me Like it's louder than it should be and I saw like I touched the window and like it's not vibrating.

92
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:25,538
Speaker 1: I'm trying to figure it out.

93
00:06:25,821 --> 00:06:38,710
Speaker 1: so eventually we have this power strip on the couch and there's a USB charger plugged into it and then There's this assortment of like five other one-off USB chargers that I guess people have over the years Plugged into that when they visited and just left there.

94
00:06:39,193 --> 00:06:40,860
Speaker 0: Why don't they use the group charger?

95
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,728
Speaker 1: I don't know like the group charger is there.

96
00:06:42,849 --> 00:06:49,639
Speaker 1: and yet I watch people sit next to it Take their phone out plug into the power strip with a device like this.

97
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:55,627
Speaker 1: Yeah, so whoever left this device here is losing it because I'm throwing it away I just damage it so that no one will use it.

98
00:06:55,647 --> 00:06:59,480
Speaker 1: because I realize eventually because I turn off the power strip the buzzing stops.

99
00:07:00,144 --> 00:07:05,239
Speaker 1: Oh, I turn the power strip back on And I one by one unplug things from it.

100
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:12,180
Speaker 1: And when I unplug this and held it up to my ear, it was buzzing so loud that you would be surprised.

101
00:07:13,521 --> 00:07:18,657
Speaker 1: And it's continued to buzz because you know, it's there's a coil in here it's there's induction for like 45 seconds.

102
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:23,379
Speaker 1: Pretty sure there's problems inside of this thing.

103
00:07:23,822 --> 00:07:28,849
Speaker 1: So I damaged it so that no one can use it and I'm going to dispose of it Which is the topic of the show.

104
00:07:28,869 --> 00:07:30,820
Speaker 0: you just missed our disposal opportunity.

105
00:07:30,861 --> 00:07:37,500
Speaker 1: Yeah I disposed of a lot of things that the disposal opportunity and this is gonna go in my bucket until the next disposal opportunity.

106
00:07:37,922 --> 00:07:40,173
Speaker 1: Hmm, I guess I could take it like staples or something like.

107
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:41,299
Speaker 1: those places will take this stuff.

108
00:07:41,843 --> 00:07:42,246
Speaker 0: Best buy.

109
00:07:42,488 --> 00:07:43,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, which anyway got any news.

110
00:07:45,681 --> 00:07:45,982
Speaker 0: What was?

111
00:07:46,103 --> 00:07:51,180
Speaker 0: I don't have any news, but I did acquire an iPhone 7 so let's talk about that, right?

112
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:58,380
Speaker 0: So my original plan was to get the iPhone 7s which you know, the iPhone 6s came out March.

113
00:07:58,863 --> 00:08:00,877
Speaker 0: So if I could wait until March I get iPhone 7s.

114
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,659
Speaker 0: It's almost Gary almost guaranteed not a hundred percent guaranteed which would be a smaller iPhone, which is nice.

115
00:08:07,724 --> 00:08:13,479
Speaker 1: It's basically the iPhone 5 Small phones because this phone I realized in my my packs prime hoodie.

116
00:08:13,801 --> 00:08:17,634
Speaker 1: There's this little sub pocket within the right main pocket and I there's no like.

117
00:08:17,755 --> 00:08:19,140
Speaker 1: there's nothing that would go in that pocket.

118
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:22,231
Speaker 1: Yeah, this phone fits in that pocket pocket perfectly.

119
00:08:22,532 --> 00:08:22,813
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

120
00:08:23,154 --> 00:08:24,900
Speaker 1: My own phone could not go in that pocket.

121
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,960
Speaker 0: So here's the situation though.

122
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,399
Speaker 0: So I go to the Apple store and I'm looking at the iPhone 6s and I'm like, huh?

123
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:33,674
Speaker 0: You know the iPhone 7s is basically gonna be that only better right?

124
00:08:33,754 --> 00:08:35,440
Speaker 0: Is that is that gonna cut it, right?

125
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:40,216
Speaker 0: Am I gonna be able to use my iPhone 6 for a few more months and then get this guy?

126
00:08:40,436 --> 00:08:41,299
Speaker 0: Will that be okay?

127
00:08:41,318 --> 00:09:00,540
Speaker 0: and I started to do some researches and while it is great that it's smaller it actually wasn't as much smaller as I remember like I put it next to the iPhone 6 and 7 and it was only like Less than an inch smaller in one dimension and like not even a centimeter smaller in the other dimension and it's actually thicker.

128
00:09:01,122 --> 00:09:05,559
Speaker 0: So, I don't know about the total volume difference but you know, it wasn't that big a deal.

129
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:22,434
Speaker 0: also You know, I mostly care like the size is like my number one thing I cared about But it's like they're all the second tier priorities Using that iPhone 6s after using an iPhone regular 6 for two years.

130
00:09:23,216 --> 00:09:24,300
Speaker 0: It was like way slow.

131
00:09:24,824 --> 00:09:31,198
Speaker 1: You know that is a trade-off because my you know I have the Xperia z5 compact which I still think is the best Android hardware in the world.

132
00:09:31,258 --> 00:09:31,700
Speaker 1: bar none.

133
00:09:32,162 --> 00:09:33,974
Speaker 0: But Google pixels come in any second.

134
00:09:34,115 --> 00:09:34,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we'll see how that goes.

135
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:39,620
Speaker 0: But I don't know if Google pixels gonna be a great phone, but I think it's gonna be a normal phone.

136
00:09:39,861 --> 00:09:44,020
Speaker 0: But I think the advantage is you're gonna get your normal Android with your updates constantly.

137
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's gonna put that ahead of every other Android phone?

138
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:52,100
Speaker 1: But the only problem with this phone is that the battery lasts two full days like for real.

139
00:09:52,581 --> 00:09:55,892
Speaker 1: But it only does that because it's kind of slow and a little laggy.

140
00:09:56,294 --> 00:10:00,451
Speaker 1: if I turn off all the power saving shit It lasts about as long as a normal iPhone like.

141
00:10:00,471 --> 00:10:01,415
Speaker 1: it lasts about one day.

142
00:10:01,435 --> 00:10:05,732
Speaker 0: and it's way fast And like even though the screen on the iPhone 6s is a retina screen.

143
00:10:05,752 --> 00:10:08,060
Speaker 0: or I mean se not success se.

144
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:10,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've been saying success the whole time.

145
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,332
Speaker 0: I mean se the small one.

146
00:10:11,633 --> 00:10:14,003
Speaker 0: Yeah success is the one that's in between the six And the seven.

147
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:17,220
Speaker 1: well, I've got a z5 C for what it's worth, right?

148
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:25,056
Speaker 0: but yeah, the SE is the small iPhone and Like everything else about the small iPhone except for the fact that it was small was like worse.

149
00:10:25,116 --> 00:10:26,280
Speaker 0: the camera was worse.

150
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, even here does the z5 compacts camera.

151
00:10:28,989 --> 00:10:30,394
Speaker 1: while it's a really good camera.

152
00:10:30,434 --> 00:10:33,127
Speaker 1: Like it's as good as an older screen The screen was worse.

153
00:10:33,168 --> 00:10:33,349
Speaker 0: Yep.

154
00:10:33,409 --> 00:10:34,335
Speaker 1: The screen is only 720p on this thing.

155
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:40,671
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was like, uh, like the big version of this phone is better in every way except It's too big to put in my pocket right.

156
00:10:40,752 --> 00:10:47,620
Speaker 0: further compounding My difficulties is that my iPhone 6 while working perfectly and in great condition was having battery issues.

157
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:50,060
Speaker 1: I think you sabotaged that battery on purpose.

158
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,016
Speaker 0: It was not having battery issues of the sort where the battery was dying.

159
00:10:54,157 --> 00:10:57,147
Speaker 0: quite the opposite The battery was lasting just as long as it ever had.

160
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:04,900
Speaker 0: but the battery meter that reported how much percentage is left Was all fucked up despite me trying to recalibrate it multiple times.

161
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,756
Speaker 0: So for example, I would I had it at a hundred percent.

162
00:11:08,797 --> 00:11:11,854
Speaker 0: I left the office Like less than an hour later.

163
00:11:11,935 --> 00:11:23,760
Speaker 0: It said like 70% and then like less than an hour by the time I got back to the office It was like 20-something percent that I did use it to make a video but 20% after making like a little Scott's lunch video.

164
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,019
Speaker 0: That's not too much.

165
00:11:25,269 --> 00:11:31,980
Speaker 0: Yeah As soon as I plugged it back into my computer at the office like plug it in do I acknowledge that I've been plugged in?

166
00:11:32,482 --> 00:11:33,386
Speaker 0: The battery meter said 88%.

167
00:11:33,386 --> 00:11:37,825
Speaker 0: I had only actually used 12% of the battery It was.

168
00:11:37,866 --> 00:11:40,418
Speaker 0: I tried to drain it completely once to recalibrate it.

169
00:11:41,121 --> 00:11:42,446
Speaker 0: I was went to bed and it said 1%.

170
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:46,061
Speaker 0: I woke up and it said 1%.

171
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:53,755
Speaker 0: It was lunchtime and it still said 1% even though it hadn't been plugged in since the previous evening and Then just about at lunchtime.

172
00:11:53,815 --> 00:11:57,870
Speaker 0: It turned off So it had battery meter issues.

173
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:05,198
Speaker 0: So I'm like, oh rather than deal with these issues Because I mean you might think well if it's lasting as long and the meter just as 1% you just ignore.

174
00:12:05,218 --> 00:12:10,460
Speaker 1: the probe is the Consequences of the battery hitting zero when you're out and about can be devastating.

175
00:12:10,701 --> 00:12:20,616
Speaker 0: The real consequence is that when the iPhone meter hits 20% it goes in the low power mode and stops doing stuff And then it tries to turn itself off even though it had plenty of power left.

176
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:21,680
Speaker 0: because the meter is wrong.

177
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,780
Speaker 0: It's doing things based on the meter that are you know getting annoying?

178
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:31,502
Speaker 1: Yeah, my phone will do that when I hit 10% but I can configure that also to replace the battery would have cost 60 to $80.

179
00:12:31,502 --> 00:12:33,247
Speaker 0: so I'm like, well fuck it.

180
00:12:33,267 --> 00:12:34,511
Speaker 0: Let me just get iPhone 7.

181
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:36,677
Speaker 0: So the reason I also got the iPhone 7?

182
00:12:36,677 --> 00:12:39,432
Speaker 0: because it was effectively free ish.

183
00:12:41,482 --> 00:12:46,746
Speaker 0: So the reason it was effectively free ish is because Verizon changed their plans.

184
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:55,495
Speaker 0: I looked at like maybe switch to t-mobile maybe You know whatever but horizon changed their plan to where I was paying for six gigs of data like $100 a month, right?

185
00:12:55,535 --> 00:13:01,159
Speaker 0: I Could change the plan to either eight gigs of data for the same amount of money.

186
00:13:02,402 --> 00:13:07,800
Speaker 0: But they now allow rollover data and I looked at my past history and I was using less than four gigs a month.

187
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:13,454
Speaker 0: So I went to the four gig a month plan Which is 70 bucks a month like 30 gigs for $30 for four gigs.

188
00:13:15,181 --> 00:13:15,992
Speaker 0: fuck that right.

189
00:13:16,539 --> 00:13:23,666
Speaker 0: and The rollover data should help me in those months that like one month a year where there's two conventions and I go over the limit The rollover data will get me through.

190
00:13:24,128 --> 00:13:29,005
Speaker 0: so I saved 30 bucks a month by switching to the Verizon plan That was smaller.

191
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:37,960
Speaker 0: and then I got the iPhone upgrade plan Which is get a new iPhone every single year no matter what and all you do is pay 30 something bucks a month.

192
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,760
Speaker 0: So I'm basically paying a hundred bucks a month that I was paying all this time.

193
00:13:41,422 --> 00:13:43,409
Speaker 0: And I just get a new iPhone every year no matter what.

194
00:13:43,509 --> 00:13:49,220
Speaker 0: but the other problem with the small iPhone the SE They don't let you do the upgrade plan with that phone.

195
00:13:49,521 --> 00:13:52,216
Speaker 0: They only let you do it with the big iPhone or the normal iPhone.

196
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:53,883
Speaker 0: really Yeah, you can't get.

197
00:13:54,144 --> 00:13:57,573
Speaker 0: you can't use the iPhone upgrade plan, which gives you permanent Apple care.

198
00:13:57,634 --> 00:14:01,394
Speaker 0: also with the small iPhone You can only do it with the normal iPhone.

199
00:14:01,535 --> 00:14:02,080
Speaker 1: That's a shame.

200
00:14:02,282 --> 00:14:03,451
Speaker 0: So I got.

201
00:14:03,652 --> 00:14:04,620
Speaker 0: I just said all right fuck it.

202
00:14:04,861 --> 00:14:08,614
Speaker 0: I went into the Apple store and they gave me an iPhone 7 for effectively nothing.

203
00:14:08,635 --> 00:14:11,791
Speaker 1: and I know okay We'll see what I do cuz I got my phone.

204
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:13,200
Speaker 1: so this phone will last me a while.

205
00:14:13,361 --> 00:14:16,558
Speaker 0: So I just see what's great about the iPhone 7 and you know what?

206
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:21,956
Speaker 0: Compared to the iPhone 6 the I I mean I've gotten every iPhone.

207
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,000
Speaker 0: that was a major jump.

208
00:14:23,241 --> 00:14:24,445
Speaker 0: I got the iPhone 3G.

209
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:30,286
Speaker 0: I got the iPhone 4 5 & 6 and now this is the 7 and The like.

210
00:14:30,466 --> 00:14:35,528
Speaker 0: the 3G was way different than the original one The 4 was way different than 3G.

211
00:14:35,669 --> 00:14:42,421
Speaker 0: the 5 was way different than the 4. the 6 was way Different than the 5. the 7 is not that much different than the 6.

212
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:43,664
Speaker 0: It's like it's it might.

213
00:14:43,725 --> 00:14:49,179
Speaker 0: it's basically like 6s and 6 6s and 7. all might as well be really the same phone.

214
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:53,273
Speaker 0: The mate like the camera is significantly improved.

215
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:58,240
Speaker 0: There's no question about that Which is nice, but it's not like game-changing.

216
00:14:58,862 --> 00:15:05,729
Speaker 0: It has the force touch thing where you can push down harder on something to get a context menu Which actually works really well, which is nice.

217
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:06,131
Speaker 1: Yep.

218
00:15:06,432 --> 00:15:08,198
Speaker 0: The home button is not a physical button.

219
00:15:08,358 --> 00:15:10,040
Speaker 1: tap ticks That's the word for that.

220
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:16,573
Speaker 0: It has all these tap ticks like the steam controller has and it really feels like you're pushing a home button But it's not a physical mechanism.

221
00:15:16,613 --> 00:15:17,359
Speaker 0: So it's way better.

222
00:15:17,379 --> 00:15:17,439
Speaker 1: now.

223
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:20,740
Speaker 1: I saw the usual pre-complaining of people who were like, oh they're rid of the physical.

224
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:24,019
Speaker 1: You know the people who complain about those kinds of things complain about a thing before they use it.

225
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:28,617
Speaker 1: But in this case, I noticed when the iPhone felt weird for about two minutes and now it's.

226
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:29,038
Speaker 0: I can't go.

227
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:30,678
Speaker 0: It would feel weird if I went back.

228
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:40,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, when the phone came you literally walk over to me and you're like touch this and I touch the button and it felt pretty Good, but yeah, all those complaints the pre-complaints pretty much disappeared when people actually touched it.

229
00:15:40,135 --> 00:15:40,958
Speaker 0: So it's fine.

230
00:15:41,159 --> 00:15:42,948
Speaker 0: It's a button That's not a real buttons.

231
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, it works.

232
00:15:44,216 --> 00:15:44,859
Speaker 1: button is coming out.

233
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:52,079
Speaker 0: The only valid complaint that I can find right is in regards of course to the no headphone hole.

234
00:15:52,119 --> 00:15:56,149
Speaker 0: now People be like, there's no headphone hole DRM.

235
00:15:56,190 --> 00:16:02,282
Speaker 0: and I'm like dudes that while I am anti DRM Just as much as you that is the biggest bullshit I ever heard.

236
00:16:02,342 --> 00:16:08,400
Speaker 0: because they're worried that for example that there's only this lightning output that someone could write code.

237
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:14,080
Speaker 0: That's like if watching football game on phone don't allow audio out lightning hole.

238
00:16:14,822 --> 00:16:19,235
Speaker 0: You could write code on an old iPhone that says don't allow audio out analog hole.

239
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:28,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not any fucking different Because the audio still originates at a digital source and therefore can be controlled by the same DRM regardless of whether there's an analog Output or not.

240
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:35,286
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Because they give you that lightning to analog hole They can't stop you.

241
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:37,816
Speaker 0: It's like what the you know, right?

242
00:16:37,956 --> 00:16:39,663
Speaker 0: It's it's Different.

243
00:16:39,864 --> 00:16:46,113
Speaker 0: now people I think they analogize because inside an iPhone 6, you know, what's behind that analog hole Effectively a lightning hole.

244
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:48,305
Speaker 1: Yeah lose a red Any fucking different.

245
00:16:48,607 --> 00:17:02,628
Speaker 1: but so with I think people get confused because with a video like the HTTP nonsense Yeah the deal is if you don't have a trusted chain the analog output meaning the light your human eyes can see is Downgraded in quality.

246
00:17:02,649 --> 00:17:03,071
Speaker 0: That's true.

247
00:17:03,674 --> 00:17:07,893
Speaker 1: and with audio What down great like they're not gonna do the same thing.

248
00:17:08,032 --> 00:17:09,680
Speaker 1: audio is not downgraded.

249
00:17:09,761 --> 00:17:11,359
Speaker 1: It would be one thing isn't copyright?

250
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,243
Speaker 0: It'll be one thing.

251
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:12,726
Speaker 0: if it was.

252
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,700
Speaker 0: you must use Bluetooth headphones or lightning.

253
00:17:16,521 --> 00:17:18,868
Speaker 0: You cannot use analog headphones.

254
00:17:18,888 --> 00:17:21,617
Speaker 0: we did not make an adapter but no there's an adapter.

255
00:17:21,659 --> 00:17:23,911
Speaker 0: therefore That's a bullshit argument.

256
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:30,214
Speaker 1: Also audio is Basically trivial to capture like say there was HTTP style.

257
00:17:30,254 --> 00:17:31,618
Speaker 1: crazy DRM down the road.

258
00:17:31,638 --> 00:17:36,151
Speaker 1: in these things Speakers are microphones like the at closing.

259
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:40,891
Speaker 1: bringing the analog hole back into the digital realm also Has no DRM money.

260
00:17:40,911 --> 00:17:41,939
Speaker 0: you could always do it that way.

261
00:17:43,623 --> 00:17:44,657
Speaker 1: Quality depending on.

262
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:48,107
Speaker 0: Regardless, there is a valid argument though.

263
00:17:48,147 --> 00:17:50,534
Speaker 0: The valid argument is many people pointed this out.

264
00:17:51,055 --> 00:17:51,877
Speaker 0: There's no headphone hole.

265
00:17:51,897 --> 00:17:52,820
Speaker 0: There's only a lightning hole.

266
00:17:53,782 --> 00:17:56,740
Speaker 0: You can't charge and listen at the same time through the lightning hole.

267
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:06,720
Speaker 0: You would need Bluetooth or wireless headphones to listen and charge it or a special lightning Special thingy that has an analog hole and a lightning hole so you could charge and listen at the same time.

268
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:13,991
Speaker 0: But I bought an extra analog hole nine bucks just in case plus I might you know.

269
00:18:14,011 --> 00:18:17,392
Speaker 0: and Yeah, it's not the biggest deal.

270
00:18:17,594 --> 00:18:18,440
Speaker 0: It's slightly annoying.

271
00:18:18,782 --> 00:18:30,854
Speaker 1: I mean the only the only time I could ever see that actually being annoying is That I often fuck around with my phone when I'm flying Yep, and I'm usually also plugged into the USB port on the plane.

272
00:18:31,155 --> 00:18:32,940
Speaker 1: keeping my phone charged while I'm flying.

273
00:18:33,462 --> 00:18:34,265
Speaker 1: I could not do both.

274
00:18:34,285 --> 00:18:34,867
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

275
00:18:35,249 --> 00:18:36,976
Speaker 1: That's still a minor annoyance at best.

276
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,751
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Still I honestly though.

277
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:43,377
Speaker 1: I don't think Switching bought them that much.

278
00:18:45,301 --> 00:18:45,382
Speaker 0: It.

279
00:18:45,563 --> 00:18:49,762
Speaker 0: I think they put the tactic thing where the headphone hole used to be yeah, they could have gotten around that I mean they made.

280
00:18:49,843 --> 00:18:50,626
Speaker 1: it's been all they.

281
00:18:50,646 --> 00:18:58,080
Speaker 1: all they get out of this really is they make it thinner and I guess they Don't have to have a RAM deck in the phone anymore for audio, but they still do because there's two speakers.

282
00:18:58,627 --> 00:18:59,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh, that's another thing.

283
00:18:59,802 --> 00:19:03,664
Speaker 0: Stereo sound because they put a speaker where the headphone hole used to be Yep, and we used to be.

284
00:19:03,724 --> 00:19:05,993
Speaker 0: only the iPad had stereo sound but now the iPhone.

285
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:09,970
Speaker 1: but any argument that they don't need RAM decks Or anything is bullshit because they still have speakers.

286
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:12,280
Speaker 1: So there's still something doing that in the iPhone.

287
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess you don't need two of them now.

288
00:19:14,831 --> 00:19:15,694
Speaker 0: I don't know three of them.

289
00:19:15,815 --> 00:19:17,120
Speaker 1: I don't know how the iPhone looks internally.

290
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:19,084
Speaker 0: You can look it up online.

291
00:19:19,104 --> 00:19:19,847
Speaker 0: It's not that excited.

292
00:19:19,887 --> 00:19:23,540
Speaker 0: But yeah iPhone 7 really similar to previous iPhones.

293
00:19:23,701 --> 00:19:26,400
Speaker 0: But you know, it's fine cuz I'm gonna get an iPhone.

294
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:33,540
Speaker 0: See there's a rumor that next year there won't be an iPhone 7s They'll be an iPhone 8 and they just because they're sucking they're going slower.

295
00:19:34,163 --> 00:19:35,853
Speaker 0: Which is great because I got the upgrade plan.

296
00:19:35,873 --> 00:19:38,764
Speaker 0: So I'll just get it for nothing I'll just get one.

297
00:19:39,266 --> 00:19:39,848
Speaker 0: So it's all good.

298
00:19:40,631 --> 00:19:42,920
Speaker 1: So in other news that was kind of interesting.

299
00:19:44,920 --> 00:20:08,309
Speaker 1: Recently amber alerts and like the all those sorts of things got a lot of press in New York City because there were two separate instances where one an amber alert went out on the Tell everyone in an area with phones Overriding any settings they might have emergency broadcast system and it broadcast an amber alert to basically everyone in New York Which you know 20 ish

300
00:20:08,389 --> 00:20:09,132
Speaker 0: imagine.

301
00:20:09,393 --> 00:20:14,349
Speaker 0: Yeah millions of phones all going Simultaneously, it's just a best.

302
00:20:14,389 --> 00:20:17,805
Speaker 1: you the best part about that I mean, I'm good.

303
00:20:17,825 --> 00:20:21,477
Speaker 1: on one hand just the concept of amber alerts seems like a good thing.

304
00:20:21,517 --> 00:20:26,639
Speaker 1: But on the other hand The odds of me acting on one of those are basically zero.

305
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:31,820
Speaker 0: I Would love to see the stats on whether an amber alert is actually saved a child or something.

306
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:39,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, and aren't there like, you know while I you know Agree that a child that has been kidnapped is bad news and we should do something about that.

307
00:20:41,047 --> 00:20:51,700
Speaker 0: If you're going to alert everybody Literally everybody I think it needs to be even more serious than that Like it needs to be as serious as like holy shit.

308
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:56,300
Speaker 0: You know a meteor is going to land or holy shits everyone seek shelter.

309
00:20:56,521 --> 00:21:05,300
Speaker 1: Like I was okay with the second time they used it around here when the guy who was trying to do all the bombings They put an alert out saying here's this guy's photo.

310
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,047
Speaker 1: He's armed and dangerous and somewhere in the city.

311
00:21:07,288 --> 00:21:09,235
Speaker 0: Even that is a borderline usage.

312
00:21:09,436 --> 00:21:10,420
Speaker 1: I think that was fine.

313
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:22,220
Speaker 1: Now if I only think that was fine because they were pretty sure he was in the city They had a photo of him They knew who he was and he was likely dangerous and he was armed and you know that I think that was no K use.

314
00:21:22,601 --> 00:21:27,900
Speaker 0: I think you only should alert literally everybody of something if literally everybody has to take action.

315
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:31,340
Speaker 1: But that one was easy because everyone basically has looked around like was the guy here?

316
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,638
Speaker 1: It's not like unsolved mysteries where you're an amber alert where the odds are pretty much zero.

317
00:21:35,658 --> 00:21:39,775
Speaker 1: this works Mmm, but the out the the fallout of this was not.

318
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,080
Speaker 1: why did everyone bother me?

319
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:49,215
Speaker 1: Most people are okay with that alert though with the amber alert Twitter was nothing but to see if people going what the fuck is an amber alert.

320
00:21:49,376 --> 00:21:50,299
Speaker 0: Well, people don't know.

321
00:21:50,782 --> 00:21:51,828
Speaker 1: No, it's a problem.

322
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,357
Speaker 0: That is a problem.

323
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:57,132
Speaker 0: Yeah Silver alert is just as serious.

324
00:21:57,192 --> 00:21:58,660
Speaker 0: I think as amber alert, right?

325
00:21:58,881 --> 00:22:00,600
Speaker 1: It's like there's an old person you missing.

326
00:22:00,921 --> 00:22:04,980
Speaker 1: So this is you want to make a real cold horrible calculated evil.

327
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:09,449
Speaker 0: People's lives are more valuable than old people's lives because you could die Anyway in a vacuum between the two.

328
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:11,460
Speaker 1: a young person's life is worth more, right?

329
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,303
Speaker 0: But is it worth?

330
00:22:12,785 --> 00:22:15,517
Speaker 0: is it the difference between an old person's life and young person's life?

331
00:22:15,557 --> 00:22:16,240
Speaker 0: the difference between?

332
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:22,000
Speaker 0: Bothering every single person's phone and not I think the line should be is the gap.

333
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:29,640
Speaker 1: What are the odds that everyone getting this alert will alter the otherwise predicted outcome of this situation?

334
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:43,447
Speaker 0: Everyone to vote Today vote now, we'll keep alerting your phone until you vote Your phone number.

335
00:22:43,467 --> 00:22:48,234
Speaker 1: in fact until your phone shows up at the polls We're gonna keep alerting you and then your phone is gonna disable itself.

336
00:22:48,455 --> 00:22:57,100
Speaker 1: Yeah You want to alter history with alerts on phones, but the fallout from the terror alert was why is this system?

337
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,753
Speaker 1: So primitive and can't eat.

338
00:22:58,794 --> 00:23:01,223
Speaker 1: It can send 300.

339
00:23:01,223 --> 00:23:03,049
Speaker 1: I think it can only send 90 characters.

340
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a pretty shitty system in a world.

341
00:23:06,141 --> 00:23:23,655
Speaker 0: If you look if you already agree that you're gonna use this system Whether we're gonna argue about whether it should or should not be used in which cases it should still be a much better system That is capable of say, you know saying messages out loud for people who are blind or showing pictures of the guy You're looking for or the person you're looking.

342
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:29,280
Speaker 0: Okay, Scott So a car having links that you can click on in the message that would bring you to more.

343
00:23:29,360 --> 00:23:30,706
Speaker 1: So that was the thing.

344
00:23:30,746 --> 00:23:38,820
Speaker 0: because the terror alert the reason it worked was that or doing better Targeting of exactly which phones it's going to alert and not just everyone in the whole fucking city.

345
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:47,490
Speaker 1: So all of those 90 characters in the terror one They they used it to link to a website that had a picture of the guy and that's the only reason they caught it Mm-hmm.

346
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:53,908
Speaker 1: So a consequence of the fact that we're kind of live streaming geek nights when we make it now A listener just did the research for us.

347
00:23:54,290 --> 00:24:05,375
Speaker 1: according to the amber alert government side There are 261 amber alerts total in the US between January 1st 2006. there were 10 years ago amber alerts.

348
00:24:05,495 --> 00:24:13,420
Speaker 1: Okay in that year 214 children were recovered and 53 of those were directly attributed to the amber alerts being issued.

349
00:24:15,121 --> 00:24:20,305
Speaker 0: If it saved 53 kids a year well That's it.

350
00:24:20,346 --> 00:24:23,237
Speaker 0: You had to quantify how annoying the alert is.

351
00:24:23,257 --> 00:24:23,739
Speaker 0: the car.

352
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:32,333
Speaker 1: So, you know if it was one kid a year and I don't want to get woken up if it's so effective Should we not be alerting all sorts of fucking other things?

353
00:24:32,735 --> 00:24:36,130
Speaker 1: well maybe but that's again I think the line of whether or not you like

354
00:24:36,191 --> 00:24:42,941
Speaker 0: if you're gonna say the amber alert is effective Then how come we're not using this alert system to say do all sorts of other good But

355
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:46,251
Speaker 1: like what the line is will this alert one?

356
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:49,140
Speaker 0: We're either alerting unnecessarily or not alerting enough.

357
00:24:49,201 --> 00:24:49,856
Speaker 0: It's one of the two.

358
00:24:50,251 --> 00:24:57,736
Speaker 1: Yeah but I think the line has to be Will the expected outcome change or be likely to change as a result of this and at what point?

359
00:24:58,057 --> 00:24:59,100
Speaker 0: if we alert too much?

360
00:24:59,341 --> 00:25:02,959
Speaker 0: Will the alerts become less effective because everyone ignores them because you do too much?

361
00:25:03,562 --> 00:25:08,978
Speaker 1: Right, and it's very telling that this is only happened as far as I can tell with this system in New York.

362
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,303
Speaker 1: twice Cuz.

363
00:25:10,323 --> 00:25:12,052
Speaker 1: that's the only two times has ever happened to me.

364
00:25:12,293 --> 00:25:13,539
Speaker 0: I've heard it happened to me a bunch.

365
00:25:13,981 --> 00:25:19,727
Speaker 1: I guess I haven't once because I don't want me to have it and I got it once for flash flooding But it was specific to LIC.

366
00:25:19,847 --> 00:25:25,893
Speaker 0: it happened twice recently and then there was a huge gap But like maybe two years ago going backwards.

367
00:25:25,994 --> 00:25:27,420
Speaker 0: There was like a ton of it happening.

368
00:25:28,283 --> 00:25:32,506
Speaker 0: the only time it was ever useful to me was the Yeah, the hurricanes coming.

369
00:25:32,567 --> 00:25:33,992
Speaker 0: We're not gonna run the subway anymore.

370
00:25:34,013 --> 00:25:35,860
Speaker 0: You better actually go home from this burning con.

371
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:37,026
Speaker 1: I think that was a good one.

372
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:41,680
Speaker 1: Even though I literally caught the last subway out of town I think I was on the second last train.

373
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:54,020
Speaker 1: I know I was on the last because every station the guy ran out of the train Gathered people from like the ticket booths and turned off all the lights and locked a bunch of gates Got back on the train on the train rent.

374
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,460
Speaker 1: So the train ride took forever because it stopped at every station for like five minutes.

375
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:58,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, mine train did not do that.

376
00:25:59,153 --> 00:26:00,020
Speaker 0: It was the second last year.

377
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:03,820
Speaker 1: I was real glad I caught that train cuz I realized if I didn't you're walking home in a heart.

378
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:13,324
Speaker 1: I was gonna walk home in a hurricane over the bridge or I was a travel ban a taxi wasn't gonna take you no, or I was gonna stay in that bar and The people run in.

379
00:26:13,344 --> 00:26:19,066
Speaker 1: the bar stayed after the subway went down and I know for a fact at least one of the bartenders did Not live in Manhattan.

380
00:26:19,447 --> 00:26:19,528
Speaker 1: Mmm.

381
00:26:19,829 --> 00:26:20,713
Speaker 1: I don't know what that guy did.

382
00:26:20,733 --> 00:26:21,215
Speaker 1: I don't know.

383
00:26:21,355 --> 00:26:22,360
Speaker 1: I'll bet they just stayed at the bar.

384
00:26:22,641 --> 00:26:23,625
Speaker 1: Maybe I would have.

385
00:26:23,866 --> 00:26:24,247
Speaker 1: yeah, why not?

386
00:26:24,408 --> 00:26:26,798
Speaker 1: if they let me we could just kept burning kind of going all night.

387
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:29,778
Speaker 0: Okay Yeah, I mean it's a hurricane shit like that happened.

388
00:26:35,262 --> 00:26:37,912
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day.

389
00:26:38,193 --> 00:26:39,960
Speaker 1: so, you know a toilet works, right?

390
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:45,859
Speaker 1: Actually, I learned a whole lot about how a toilet works recently How to get rid of that silt in you in the top of your thing.

391
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:52,877
Speaker 0: I did a whole bunch of research and I made my toilet way awesome by doing if I adjusted the water I learned everything about basic toiletry.

392
00:26:52,897 --> 00:27:02,205
Speaker 1: now I don't know how to fix a fancy Japanese toilet but I know everything about a standard American toilets because one time we had a toilet like Emily did something and messed up a Toilet and I remember like.

393
00:27:02,747 --> 00:27:06,920
Speaker 1: I went through all my troubleshooting steps and I determined that it was unfixable by my time.

394
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:07,204
Speaker 0: I am now.

395
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:14,680
Speaker 0: thanks to YouTube I am now an expert on basic American toilet mechanisms and can repair them and know which parts to buy an Amazon and everything.

396
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:22,975
Speaker 1: So as a complete aside, I am terrified by the people whose houses I visited Where their toilet kind of runs and got a jiggle the handle.

397
00:27:22,995 --> 00:27:23,900
Speaker 0: I know how to fix that.

398
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:25,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you need to hire a plumber.

399
00:27:26,011 --> 00:27:32,760
Speaker 0: if I come to your house and you have a shitty toilet Just give me permission to make your toilet awesome and we will do that and I'll teach you how a toilet works.

400
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,847
Speaker 0: It'll take like 10 minutes.

401
00:27:33,907 --> 00:27:34,672
Speaker 0: It's real simple.

402
00:27:34,994 --> 00:27:38,974
Speaker 1: Romans figured it out Not naming names, but I'm terrified by the fact that I know people.

403
00:27:39,034 --> 00:27:45,680
Speaker 1: we've visited their house and Later like a year later we visit again and the toilet still has the same problem.

404
00:27:46,202 --> 00:27:50,200
Speaker 0: I mean my toilet had a problem for a while until I sort of realized I can do this.

405
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,651
Speaker 0: It's like it doesn't dawn on you because it's a black box, right?

406
00:27:52,691 --> 00:27:54,500
Speaker 0: It's like it's like your whole life.

407
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,440
Speaker 1: Well, if it's black in there, you got real serious problems, right?

408
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,019
Speaker 0: But like your whole life you've called plumbers to fix this thing.

409
00:28:00,402 --> 00:28:03,160
Speaker 0: You'd never imagine it like it's a really simple thing.

410
00:28:03,361 --> 00:28:11,600
Speaker 0: And as long as the toilet itself isn't like smashed or there's something wrong with the pipes or serious problem Well, you can do it yourself so easily.

411
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:19,836
Speaker 1: It's like babies first unlike other plumbing problems Like I generally don't take you like those use out of tote Like I'm not gonna deal with the pipes just because there's a lot of like.

412
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:21,398
Speaker 1: if you mess that up There's a lot of consequences.

413
00:28:21,641 --> 00:28:28,043
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the only reason I don't do anything like with pipes is because I'm not strong enough to tighten it and then it'll Leak everywhere.

414
00:28:28,063 --> 00:28:30,397
Speaker 1: Well, also you don't have all the specialized tools like they're like those.

415
00:28:30,477 --> 00:28:38,120
Speaker 0: it's a lot like I could install a faucet, but I'd probably when I first turned on the faucet spray water everywhere and then be like fuck.

416
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:42,600
Speaker 1: Well, it's just like with cars and bicycles and even skis like the main like a maintenance on a bike.

417
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,300
Speaker 1: Like you can learn all the maintenance even on a fancy bike.

418
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,800
Speaker 0: I mean you can learn all the maintenance on an f1 car to if someone will teach it to you.

419
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:55,360
Speaker 1: But like bicycles are not that hard, but even I don't do most of that work because I don't own all the specialized tools.

420
00:28:55,763 --> 00:29:02,048
Speaker 0: yeah, like I actually have a Like if you don't have quite a few of the tools But I don't have like the rack.

421
00:29:02,088 --> 00:29:05,060
Speaker 1: to like mount my bike to like read like rejigger my brakes.

422
00:29:05,221 --> 00:29:11,580
Speaker 1: There are ways to yeah But it's way more pain in the ass Like when I was a kid I had the rack.

423
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:17,100
Speaker 1: I would like mount my bike and work on it and one time I tried to recalibrate all my gears without that rack.

424
00:29:17,362 --> 00:29:18,086
Speaker 1: Fuck that noise.

425
00:29:18,126 --> 00:29:19,717
Speaker 1: I'm gonna pay someone 60 bucks to do it.

426
00:29:19,898 --> 00:29:27,460
Speaker 1: Yep But so do you know about the mechanics of how toilets work in terms of how and why it flushes and why it doesn't smell?

427
00:29:27,780 --> 00:29:35,720
Speaker 1: Yes, so, uh Why would like say you put a brick of gold like a small brick of gold in the bottom of your toilet?

428
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:38,219
Speaker 1: Would it flush or would it just sit there?

429
00:29:39,382 --> 00:29:41,449
Speaker 0: Is it physically small enough to go through.

430
00:29:41,469 --> 00:29:43,576
Speaker 1: it's physically small enough, but it's real dense and heavy.

431
00:29:43,596 --> 00:29:48,519
Speaker 1: I Mean it's like we're talking ten times heavier denser than your poop.

432
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:56,106
Speaker 0: I'm not sure how strong the toilet flush is but I have a feeling it's it gets pretty strong and it also depends on how Much water you got in the tank.

433
00:29:56,166 --> 00:30:04,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you got a big even a little bowl and you flush it It's not gonna be enough right and it depends on the shape of the gold bar also, right?

434
00:30:04,196 --> 00:30:12,176
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but There are circumstances in which that yes, you could flush some amount of gold.

435
00:30:12,196 --> 00:30:15,248
Speaker 1: That would be surprising Yeah, but it turns out pretty much.

436
00:30:15,288 --> 00:30:17,640
Speaker 1: No anything heavy and dense is just not gonna flush.

437
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:18,965
Speaker 1: It'll stay in the bottom of the bowl forever.

438
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:22,540
Speaker 1: Okay, so let's say you proved instead of poop poop.

439
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,551
Speaker 1: You pooped liquid mercury, but in the same volume as your poop.

440
00:30:25,932 --> 00:30:28,020
Speaker 1: and then you tried to flush the total go near mercury.

441
00:30:28,361 --> 00:30:33,100
Speaker 1: But let's say well elemental mercury in your body actually is not that bad for you because it just passes right.

442
00:30:33,226 --> 00:30:37,232
Speaker 0: Okay, wait So we're talking about mercury in a nator to in water.

443
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:43,039
Speaker 1: you poop mercury in the quantity You normally poop into a normal water toilet and then flush it.

444
00:30:43,401 --> 00:30:46,533
Speaker 1: Will it go out into the sewer system or will it stay in the bottom?

445
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:55,415
Speaker 1: I Did not know the answer and then I watched this video and I know he's pretty heavy, but it's also a liquid But it doesn't mix with water.

446
00:30:56,482 --> 00:30:58,209
Speaker 0: So it's like this it's a really tough call.

447
00:30:58,330 --> 00:31:08,620
Speaker 1: what if you filled a toilet the top Entirely with mercury and then flushed mercury and then pooped gold and then flushed it with the gold that the water didn't move?

448
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,223
Speaker 1: now Get moved by the mercury with it Like what would happen?

449
00:31:11,243 --> 00:31:15,340
Speaker 0: the mercury would definitely flush and it would be a way stronger flush than with water.

450
00:31:15,825 --> 00:31:17,360
Speaker 0: Would it be enough to move gold?

451
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:17,941
Speaker 0: What's the?

452
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:22,600
Speaker 0: I don't forget the atomic number of gold and mercury if you're intrigued by the answers to all these questions?

453
00:31:22,963 --> 00:31:29,374
Speaker 0: My video is titled flushing 240 pounds of mercury if the atomic number of mercury is water.

454
00:31:29,615 --> 00:31:33,469
Speaker 0: if the atomic number of mercury is Bigger than the number for gold.

455
00:31:33,771 --> 00:31:35,379
Speaker 0: I think it would flush the gold.

456
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:39,160
Speaker 1: It flushes the gold but he fills an entire toilet with mercury.

457
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:42,470
Speaker 0: But is mercury have more protons than gold does?

458
00:31:42,490 --> 00:31:43,874
Speaker 1: Uh, watch your show.

459
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:45,720
Speaker 0: Let me look at my periodic table.

460
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:51,405
Speaker 1: oh, he also flushes a lead bullet and it floats on the mercury and This video is just great.

461
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:52,450
Speaker 0: I'm looking at a period.

462
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,560
Speaker 1: also, you know the chain that pulls they'll stop her up.

463
00:31:54,761 --> 00:31:57,036
Speaker 1: Yeah, it breaks cuz the mercury is too heavy.

464
00:31:57,056 --> 00:32:00,710
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah There's a moment where he sticks his hand in the mercury.

465
00:32:00,952 --> 00:32:05,660
Speaker 1: Let's see lead is Now why she's about to stick his hand in the mercury.

466
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:08,472
Speaker 1: Where is it?

467
00:32:08,893 --> 00:32:10,318
Speaker 0: Don't put your hand in mercury crazy.

468
00:32:10,339 --> 00:32:12,426
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's him flushing the toilet.

469
00:32:12,446 --> 00:32:16,178
Speaker 1: This video is pretty good All right, so you got a thing of the day.

470
00:32:16,198 --> 00:32:18,149
Speaker 1: I know you're looking up your atomic numbers.

471
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,982
Speaker 0: I Said you might think of the day.

472
00:32:22,002 --> 00:32:22,446
Speaker 0: What was it?

473
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:24,918
Speaker 0: There it is.

474
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:26,550
Speaker 0: It's a real simple little Instagram.

475
00:32:26,631 --> 00:32:43,468
Speaker 0: This guy was biking to work yeah in New York on the west side bike path like you do and he's got a camera on his thing like you do and He encounters a real-life Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle on his bike ride to work because they live in New York.

476
00:32:43,488 --> 00:32:46,233
Speaker 0: That's where they're from And they're like.

477
00:32:46,273 --> 00:32:47,557
Speaker 0: that's a rare sighting.

478
00:32:47,597 --> 00:32:50,807
Speaker 0: that's like seeing like a super camouflaged owl during the day like you.

479
00:32:50,827 --> 00:32:57,183
Speaker 0: don't see that shit right, so The fact that it was caught on video and post on Instagram is like pretty amazing.

480
00:32:57,704 --> 00:32:58,507
Speaker 0: So check it out.

481
00:32:58,768 --> 00:33:08,169
Speaker 1: Yeah So in the meta moment, oh the book club book is Rebecca I'll probably read it on my trip and then we'll do the show right after I get back from Australia.

482
00:33:09,412 --> 00:33:12,793
Speaker 1: Otherwise we had no conventions coming up until Magfest.

483
00:33:12,833 --> 00:33:16,226
Speaker 1: but we will be at mag fest doing whole bunch of panels.

484
00:33:16,266 --> 00:33:17,250
Speaker 1: We're part of the mages group.

485
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,656
Speaker 1: We'll be at all that academic stuff.

486
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:19,781
Speaker 1: Magfest is awesome.

487
00:33:19,801 --> 00:33:20,584
Speaker 1: We're totally gonna be there.

488
00:33:20,604 --> 00:33:21,950
Speaker 1: It's gonna be awesome as always.

489
00:33:22,391 --> 00:33:27,710
Speaker 1: I also got the video of our most recent panel our packs panel on the grind from PAX West.

490
00:33:28,194 --> 00:33:46,562
Speaker 1: I put the whole thing up on YouTube and actually Because of Atari game design which is also on YouTube now Which had probably a more complex pipeline because I had the camera angles But I also had to sync us actually playing Atari games live and all that stuff I took the time to actually make like a real video pipeline.

491
00:33:46,602 --> 00:33:52,090
Speaker 1: so I can crank out panel video Way faster and higher quality than we've ever done before.

492
00:33:52,652 --> 00:33:58,010
Speaker 1: So at least when we video our panels at PAX is you can expect them on YouTube like right away from now on.

493
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:03,790
Speaker 1: That is not the case for other conventions because the lighting in the rooms are so bad that usually the video is not worthwhile.

494
00:34:03,991 --> 00:34:06,729
Speaker 1: But at least at PAX is that he was gonna be a real quick.

495
00:34:08,371 --> 00:34:15,422
Speaker 1: Otherwise, yeah follow both means got on YouTube and Other places and I'm gonna be out of town in Australia for the next two weeks.

496
00:34:16,024 --> 00:34:26,190
Speaker 1: So after the winds on me Yeah, after the Wednesday show will be gone for a while Emily and I might record podcasts of our Australia experiences for the patreon.

497
00:34:26,350 --> 00:34:27,981
Speaker 0: But otherwise, I'll do some streaming bits.

498
00:34:28,001 --> 00:34:29,268
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get my stream going on.

499
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:34,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you know, so geek nights will be on momentary hiatus But we're both making a lot of other content.

500
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,585
Speaker 0: come to my youtube channel instead.

501
00:34:36,987 --> 00:34:37,630
Speaker 1: I'll have part two.

502
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:39,054
Speaker 1: I'll have more parts of our.

503
00:34:39,234 --> 00:34:41,822
Speaker 1: remember Scott said five series coming up this week as well.

504
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:47,617
Speaker 1: So also I am reading all of Castlevania to Simon's quest.

505
00:34:47,657 --> 00:34:50,989
Speaker 0: you don't need that the novel ization, but I'm gonna make good content.

506
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:52,558
Speaker 0: You're paying for that crap content.

507
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:54,690
Speaker 0: I will give you good free content that you actually want.

508
00:34:54,911 --> 00:35:02,115
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure Timothy Bradley grabbed Simon Belmont's dick and then had an orgasm but I'll leave it up.

509
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:02,397
Speaker 1: Yes.

510
00:35:02,538 --> 00:35:03,464
Speaker 0: This is what you're paying for.

511
00:35:03,484 --> 00:35:04,490
Speaker 1: Are you sure that's what happened?

512
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:07,039
Speaker 0: So by the way, gold a topic number 79.

513
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:07,520
Speaker 0: Yep.

514
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:09,166
Speaker 0: Guess what number mercury is?

515
00:35:09,186 --> 00:35:10,923
Speaker 1: Ah Fuck if I know.

516
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:16,045
Speaker 0: One just one proton more just one.

517
00:35:16,126 --> 00:35:21,700
Speaker 0: and guess where lead is 82. oh man two more protons.

518
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:22,101
Speaker 0: you got led.

519
00:35:22,141 --> 00:35:24,710
Speaker 0: It's something they're all real close, but so different.

520
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,273
Speaker 0: It's like the bad.

521
00:35:25,354 --> 00:35:28,290
Speaker 0: imagine you got a bar of gold right and you got like a hundred gold atoms.

522
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:31,560
Speaker 0: You just should add a hundred protons and now you got a hundred mercury atoms.

523
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:31,921
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

524
00:35:32,583 --> 00:35:33,205
Speaker 0: It's like it just.

525
00:35:33,306 --> 00:35:34,610
Speaker 0: it's insane science.

526
00:35:36,572 --> 00:35:59,488
Speaker 1: So two things that are sort of relevant to the show today is that one on January 1st 2015 New York City at least Passed a law where you cannot throw any of the following things away in the garbage TVs monitors computers laptops small servers printers scanners tablets e-readers mp3 players mice keyboards Video game consoles VCR.

527
00:35:59,951 --> 00:36:05,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, so people don't might not know this but like when I lived in the burbs we had private trash pickup.

528
00:36:05,750 --> 00:36:06,233
Speaker 0: You had that's cuz.

529
00:36:06,254 --> 00:36:07,622
Speaker 1: you lived in a fucked up place.

530
00:36:07,642 --> 00:36:08,950
Speaker 0: You had to pay a private.

531
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,710
Speaker 0: There's a lot of place every time I know and I think those places are all fucked up.

532
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:13,489
Speaker 1: You know trash is the only way to go.

533
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:33,316
Speaker 0: I think it's most places in the US but basically you had to pay Somebody who owned a dump truck to come to your house Pick up your trash and then take it to the public dump or disposal place for you Cuz or you could do it yourself if you really wanted to like, you know Use your own truck to bring your trash to the the transfer station or wherever it is, you know You could do that.

534
00:36:33,377 --> 00:36:34,790
Speaker 0: You didn't have to pay someone to do it.

535
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:39,726
Speaker 0: But there was no town owned dump truck that would come and pick up trash for you.

536
00:36:40,127 --> 00:36:49,955
Speaker 0: in New York City You had the Department of Sanitation which cleans the streets comes and gets the trash pretty much takes care of everything And your taxes pay for it.

537
00:36:50,276 --> 00:36:55,806
Speaker 0: so they can have a law like this because there isn't some private company That's gonna say yeah, I'll take your TV.

538
00:36:56,853 --> 00:37:01,876
Speaker 0: They come into the side of the street and they see a TV sitting there and they say fuck No, and they put a sticker on it.

539
00:37:02,117 --> 00:37:04,648
Speaker 0: And if it's still there you get a fine and you know, you get in trouble.

540
00:37:04,708 --> 00:37:11,229
Speaker 0: So You know because we have this public Department of Sanitation we have laws like this.

541
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:13,175
Speaker 0: No What you can and cannot throw away.

542
00:37:13,195 --> 00:37:17,950
Speaker 1: it got more complicated because you know complex CFLs replaced incandescent bulbs.

543
00:37:18,311 --> 00:37:19,617
Speaker 0: They got mercury in them shit.

544
00:37:19,718 --> 00:37:22,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, and now we got LEDs that I'm glad it were short-lived.

545
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,618
Speaker 1: No, I can tell you're kind of oh, it's.

546
00:37:25,019 --> 00:37:27,026
Speaker 1: it seems like it's legal to just throw them away.

547
00:37:27,087 --> 00:37:28,010
Speaker 1: It's just discouraged.

548
00:37:28,191 --> 00:37:29,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, it depends on like where you are.

549
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:30,789
Speaker 1: I don't throw them away.

550
00:37:31,051 --> 00:37:34,568
Speaker 1: no, even though theoretically residential buildings in New York have to handle that shit.

551
00:37:34,648 --> 00:37:39,768
Speaker 1: like I Took our printer because I could I went to the thing with the e-waste recycling thing and I took all our like.

552
00:37:39,808 --> 00:37:40,130
Speaker 1: all our see.

553
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:41,457
Speaker 0: If I went I took a lot of stuff there.

554
00:37:41,477 --> 00:37:43,590
Speaker 0: It's like empty propane cans and CFLs.

555
00:37:43,670 --> 00:37:48,085
Speaker 1: Well, I took a backpack filled to the brim with old batteries and CFLs.

556
00:37:48,125 --> 00:37:52,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, but It's a lead at his last battery over there.

557
00:37:52,159 --> 00:37:54,430
Speaker 1: I took a lead as a battery over there the one that was in my files.

558
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:56,778
Speaker 0: Yeah, I took the one that was used to be in my UPS.

559
00:37:56,818 --> 00:37:57,641
Speaker 0: that broke open.

560
00:37:57,982 --> 00:38:02,694
Speaker 1: Oh, I forgot to take the fucking UPS UPS under here.

561
00:38:02,714 --> 00:38:06,148
Speaker 1: my computer's plugged into it, but the battery has been dead for two years.

562
00:38:06,168 --> 00:38:07,791
Speaker 1: I just haven't Extricated.

563
00:38:07,811 --> 00:38:11,650
Speaker 0: I bought a replacement battery for my UPS and Amazon and it's only had to take the battery over there.

564
00:38:12,392 --> 00:38:13,677
Speaker 1: I don't care anymore because I've.

565
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:15,764
Speaker 1: we've never had a power outage since I moved in.

566
00:38:15,825 --> 00:38:22,128
Speaker 0: Your line has clicked frequently Really yeah, I mean over the years it is never happened.

567
00:38:22,148 --> 00:38:23,152
Speaker 1: in this apart It never even went.

568
00:38:23,213 --> 00:38:24,117
Speaker 0: click click whenever.

569
00:38:24,558 --> 00:38:27,250
Speaker 0: I mean, I've heard it go click click even though the power is still just fine.

570
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've never had that happen.

571
00:38:29,159 --> 00:38:33,738
Speaker 1: It's also good to have you know, yeah I just don't care anymore because one in the modern era.

572
00:38:33,758 --> 00:38:37,230
Speaker 0: I mean the battery caused less than like 20 bucks.

573
00:38:37,311 --> 00:38:39,025
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I'm really gonna buy a $20 power strip.

574
00:38:39,811 --> 00:38:42,409
Speaker 1: I mean what you know, well, I mean I buy like the cheap one.

575
00:38:42,610 --> 00:38:44,923
Speaker 1: I have enough power strips last me my entire life at this point.

576
00:38:44,963 --> 00:38:45,486
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever.

577
00:38:45,989 --> 00:38:51,453
Speaker 1: but So basically even though I can throw those things away I don't.

578
00:38:51,835 --> 00:38:58,375
Speaker 1: because even if there is theoretically a chain of custody where all the people in that chain will Treat them with the proper respect.

579
00:38:58,776 --> 00:39:01,985
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure they'll just get broken open and mercury gets everywhere.

580
00:39:02,587 --> 00:39:03,630
Speaker 1: and I guess I'm a good person.

581
00:39:03,630 --> 00:39:04,854
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's another thing in New York.

582
00:39:04,915 --> 00:39:07,263
Speaker 0: Is it any place where you're in a large building?

583
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:14,550
Speaker 1: right if you're in, you know your large Residential building or even a commercial building most commercial buildings seem to just fucking ignore this.

584
00:39:14,791 --> 00:39:21,882
Speaker 0: What I'm saying is that if you live in your own house and you bring your own trash to the curb if there's any Separation required you're taking care of it, right?

585
00:39:22,264 --> 00:39:25,039
Speaker 0: But if you're in a building It's up to the like.

586
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:26,270
Speaker 0: the building can just fuck you over.

587
00:39:26,330 --> 00:39:33,082
Speaker 0: You could be spending hours like separating your recycling and separating your paper from your plastic and set me know and then your building I'll just dumps it in the same place.

588
00:39:33,102 --> 00:39:34,856
Speaker 0: because they don't give a shit You know, at least are lazy.

589
00:39:34,876 --> 00:39:47,467
Speaker 1: because one thing is then this is like more in recycling But in general the right way to go is to have the single stream recycling where the recycling stream itself Like downstream from you will separate so you don't have to.

590
00:39:47,669 --> 00:39:50,399
Speaker 1: yeah Because then more people are willing to recycle like in New York.

591
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,690
Speaker 1: They tell you put all plastics in the recycling.

592
00:39:53,811 --> 00:39:58,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, even if they're not recyclable because and I think in New York you can actually recycle all plastics.

593
00:39:58,430 --> 00:40:03,370
Speaker 1: Well, so the secret is a lot of those individual plastics get separated and still landfilled.

594
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:15,850
Speaker 1: the reason they're separated is that if the technology gets better or if Demand for those plastics changes to make it economically viable instead of telling everyone Okay, now you can recycle number nine, but not number seven.

595
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:18,190
Speaker 1: They can just they don't have to tell you shit.

596
00:40:18,591 --> 00:40:23,930
Speaker 1: All they do is take the number nine that was going in the garbage and just redirect it at the facilities into the stream.

597
00:40:24,292 --> 00:40:30,785
Speaker 1: Mmm, so like it's a great thing, but my building Handles all the separation of all the other stuff downstairs.

598
00:40:30,846 --> 00:40:31,509
Speaker 1: I see him doing it.

599
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:38,809
Speaker 1: So I just take all our recyclables in a box to throw it down there and there's someone whose job it is every week to Separate everything out and deal with it.

600
00:40:39,071 --> 00:40:44,658
Speaker 0: I take all my trash and I throw it down the hole and I take anything that's not trash and I separate it and put On the floor in the trash room.

601
00:40:45,121 --> 00:40:46,790
Speaker 1: Oh, we're not allowed to put stuff in the trash room.

602
00:40:46,810 --> 00:40:47,452
Speaker 1: I gotta take it down.

603
00:40:47,492 --> 00:40:56,922
Speaker 0: specifically says like if it's glass if it's recyclable if it's like smelly food Don't throw it down the hole Just put it on the floor in the trash room and then someone will take care of.

604
00:40:57,183 --> 00:40:58,950
Speaker 1: smelly food specifically goes down the hole.

605
00:40:59,117 --> 00:41:08,817
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, but the thing is is that I've seen at least once a piece of paper by the front door That was a fine from the sanitation department.

606
00:41:08,837 --> 00:41:13,150
Speaker 0: that said hey you put something that was recyclable in the trash.

607
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:15,449
Speaker 0: You're getting a fine.

608
00:41:15,511 --> 00:41:18,999
Speaker 0: so I don't know if somebody Tossed paper down the hole or something.

609
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:24,397
Speaker 1: the only cardboard I throw down the hole because you're not supposed to is Grease-soaked pizza boxes because that's not recyclable.

610
00:41:24,758 --> 00:41:26,743
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but it lit off though.

611
00:41:26,763 --> 00:41:27,586
Speaker 0: That's not grease.

612
00:41:28,067 --> 00:41:28,969
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah usually is.

613
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:42,250
Speaker 1: But the other side piece of this is that or every time I build a computer as almost everyone does You get all your components and you get a bunch of extra shit mostly with your case or your motherboard.

614
00:41:42,431 --> 00:41:46,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you get screws you get this parts that you take off like you take off something.

615
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:50,130
Speaker 0: Maybe you don't have an optical drive anymore, but you used to take off a piece of plastic from the front.

616
00:41:50,251 --> 00:41:51,770
Speaker 0: It's the optical drive could stick out.

617
00:41:51,790 --> 00:41:53,677
Speaker 1: You used to take off like you put your video card.

618
00:41:53,697 --> 00:42:01,510
Speaker 1: you take those little metal shields off the back and in the CI slots Like in the days when you would buy cards for extra functionality, which really don't do anymore except video.

619
00:42:01,550 --> 00:42:03,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's all sorts of extra cables.

620
00:42:03,057 --> 00:42:03,640
Speaker 0: You don't use like.

621
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,629
Speaker 0: you get 10 sat cables and only use two.

622
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:10,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you got a fancy case, it's got like different cages to hold different kinds of drives.

623
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:15,687
Speaker 0: Evil ties is all those extra bits that don't actually end up in the computer.

624
00:42:15,707 --> 00:42:22,710
Speaker 0: and You know you throw most of it away or recycle most of it But there's still leftover bits that it's like I got to keep these screws.

625
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:25,721
Speaker 0: What if one day I got to add a PCI card to this computer?

626
00:42:25,802 --> 00:42:27,528
Speaker 0: or what if one day I got a?

627
00:42:27,769 --> 00:42:27,950
Speaker 0: you know?

628
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:28,976
Speaker 0: Do something here.

629
00:42:29,017 --> 00:42:30,828
Speaker 0: I'm gonna need these screws and you keep them somewhere.

630
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:31,833
Speaker 1: Yep So I would.

631
00:42:31,913 --> 00:42:38,743
Speaker 1: I have a motherboard box from every computer I've ever built pretty much worth of because I always put in the motherboard Box, it's just like because that's the empty box.

632
00:42:38,783 --> 00:42:39,689
Speaker 1: I happen to have laying there.

633
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,749
Speaker 1: I put all that stuff in a box.

634
00:42:42,272 --> 00:42:44,862
Speaker 0: I have a drawer in my little stack of drawers, but then that stuff.

635
00:42:44,943 --> 00:42:53,018
Speaker 1: the next time I build a computer I take the previous box and I open it and I have it sitting next to me while I'm building the new computer cuz like Hey, maybe I need a part.

636
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:57,521
Speaker 1: Yeah in my whole life Other than SATA and PETA cables.

637
00:42:58,184 --> 00:43:02,626
Speaker 1: I don't think I have ever Take it apart from that box and used it ever.

638
00:43:03,772 --> 00:43:07,165
Speaker 0: so there's two reasons that you know, I've used stuff from there right.

639
00:43:07,507 --> 00:43:10,415
Speaker 0: number one is I'm doing some upgrade.

640
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:11,419
Speaker 0: I wish I had it.

641
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,350
Speaker 0: So why I upgraded like the video card in my current desktop?

642
00:43:14,932 --> 00:43:16,330
Speaker 0: Uh, it was a current one or the previous.

643
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:21,286
Speaker 0: I upgraded a video card at one point and boy was I glad to have that stuff still there not thrown out.

644
00:43:21,948 --> 00:43:28,590
Speaker 0: and two sometimes you need give someone a computer and You know, they're gonna rejigger that whole computer a lot.

645
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:37,970
Speaker 0: maybe they're gonna mount some drives or unmount some drives and they will be very happy to have the screws that go with that case and The plastic bits that go with that case and the mounting equipment that goes with that case.

646
00:43:38,211 --> 00:43:40,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they'll be very sad to not have it like.

647
00:43:40,488 --> 00:43:44,958
Speaker 0: wow I want to add a hard drive to this computer But I can't get Scott throughout all the rails that he wasn't using.

648
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:49,070
Speaker 1: but I decided because I've never used this stuff anymore.

649
00:43:49,472 --> 00:43:59,150
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do a purge and when I build my new computer, I'm going to dispose of Every single computer building component that I have that is not used in that new computer.

650
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:00,653
Speaker 0: I'd keep some.

651
00:44:01,356 --> 00:44:03,684
Speaker 1: all I'm gonna keep is a handful of SATA cables.

652
00:44:03,704 --> 00:44:05,070
Speaker 0: Don't come asking for anything from me.

653
00:44:05,871 --> 00:44:10,287
Speaker 1: I'm confident based on my entire life experience that I will never need anything.

654
00:44:10,307 --> 00:44:11,873
Speaker 0: You'll buy a hard drive You'll want to mount it.

655
00:44:11,913 --> 00:44:13,258
Speaker 0: You won't have a mounting bracket.

656
00:44:13,699 --> 00:44:17,395
Speaker 1: So I be so I'm doing something different with my new computer, too One.

657
00:44:17,476 --> 00:44:18,201
Speaker 1: it's a new computer.

658
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:19,310
Speaker 1: So it has its own mounting stuff.

659
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,849
Speaker 1: So the case is gonna come with like all the mounting stuff I'll ever need.

660
00:44:22,692 --> 00:44:25,109
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna keep the stuff from the new case and throw away everything old.

661
00:44:26,932 --> 00:44:29,223
Speaker 0: What if someone wants to mount something in that old computer?

662
00:44:29,745 --> 00:44:30,508
Speaker 1: I just don't care.

663
00:44:32,053 --> 00:44:35,629
Speaker 1: Also, there's like six hard drives in that computer so you've already got enough stuff in there.

664
00:44:38,111 --> 00:44:45,370
Speaker 0: My new HD PC is great by the way, and the case is even smaller and it's so much faster.

665
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:46,373
Speaker 0: It's like the best computer.

666
00:44:46,413 --> 00:44:48,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, my HD PC is like early 2009 circa and it's like a core i3.

667
00:44:53,071 --> 00:44:59,135
Speaker 0: It's really the only thing keeping my current HD PC from being like the best desktop in the universe is that I didn't.

668
00:44:59,356 --> 00:45:05,540
Speaker 0: it only has two RAM slots, so I couldn't load it up to all the way and It can't hold really that many hard drives at all.

669
00:45:06,022 --> 00:45:07,428
Speaker 0: It has like one tiny hard drive.

670
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:07,870
Speaker 0: That's it.

671
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:10,237
Speaker 0: So but other than that, it's like incredible.

672
00:45:10,278 --> 00:45:11,261
Speaker 0: It's like it's an i5 or the 1070s.

673
00:45:11,321 --> 00:45:11,762
Speaker 0: So it's great.

674
00:45:14,855 --> 00:45:20,863
Speaker 1: So what I'm very seven years out if these kbla I think I mentioned this if the kbla chips perform as well as people said they are for video.

675
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:32,461
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get like a Tiny HDPC like one of those little baby Specially built like super tiny computers that has just like and I'm not to drive sticking it into RAM No video card at all.

676
00:45:32,562 --> 00:45:33,310
Speaker 1: No video card at all.

677
00:45:33,430 --> 00:45:40,596
Speaker 1: I don't trust I can play a lot of games on my 2009 era laptop But I'm having a 1070 on.

678
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:47,626
Speaker 0: the HD PC is so great because like I can play every game Full frames at 1080 with max settings.

679
00:45:47,667 --> 00:45:48,250
Speaker 0: No problem.

680
00:45:48,330 --> 00:45:53,716
Speaker 0: So the other and if I get a 4k TV and like a couple years when they're not bullshit when there's no when there's A reason to have them.

681
00:45:54,462 --> 00:45:55,350
Speaker 0: It'll still be great.

682
00:45:55,611 --> 00:45:56,857
Speaker 1: So what'd you do with the old HDPC?

683
00:45:56,877 --> 00:45:59,550
Speaker 1: because I guess that's the topic of the show cuz I got a debate.

684
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:00,996
Speaker 0: What is the topic of the show?

685
00:46:01,076 --> 00:46:03,064
Speaker 0: and you know what that is a perfectly good computer.

686
00:46:03,084 --> 00:46:04,229
Speaker 0: It is a is an i3.

687
00:46:04,891 --> 00:46:08,609
Speaker 0: It's not like four gigs of RAM, which isn't as much but I think you could put more in there.

688
00:46:09,550 --> 00:46:15,249
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's got a hard of one terabyte magnetic hard drive Which you could should probably replace in the SSD because it's really slow.

689
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:16,193
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it works.

690
00:46:16,997 --> 00:46:23,510
Speaker 0: and it's got an old low-profile ATI video card Which can actually play some games at decent frame rates.

691
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:26,825
Speaker 0: It just has some trouble with newer things or putting on high settings.

692
00:46:26,865 --> 00:46:31,902
Speaker 0: as long as you keep your settings low Or your resolution low or your frame rates low or your games old.

693
00:46:32,563 --> 00:46:33,627
Speaker 0: It's just fine.

694
00:46:34,008 --> 00:46:34,730
Speaker 1: But do you have a plan?

695
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:35,594
Speaker 1: What are you gonna do with it?

696
00:46:35,615 --> 00:46:36,238
Speaker 1: plays in there?

697
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:38,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just sitting there looking for a home.

698
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:42,310
Speaker 1: So I think this is a relatively new problem because I realized I was thinking about this in my whole life.

699
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:43,729
Speaker 0: Maybe I can find a place to donate it.

700
00:46:43,770 --> 00:46:46,344
Speaker 0: Does anyone like know where to donate working computers?

701
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:49,076
Speaker 1: because I was you know Because I would die wasn't rich.

702
00:46:49,116 --> 00:46:53,481
Speaker 0: thing is the case is actually, you know, it's a really nice, you know HTPC case.

703
00:46:53,501 --> 00:46:54,269
Speaker 0: there's nothing wrong with it.

704
00:46:54,450 --> 00:47:00,170
Speaker 1: It's like worth a lot actually, but computers used to be a lot more unreliable and components would fail a lot more off.

705
00:47:00,230 --> 00:47:02,529
Speaker 0: That's because we were buying AMD computers in that era.

706
00:47:02,871 --> 00:47:06,130
Speaker 0: But also just like Intel computers I've had have always been super reliable.

707
00:47:06,313 --> 00:47:13,769
Speaker 1: But for most of my life I generally only started speccing out and then building a new computer when the old one was dying or dead.

708
00:47:14,652 --> 00:47:19,545
Speaker 1: But nowadays I have to upgrade the computer I'm using because it's not fast enough.

709
00:47:19,585 --> 00:47:20,628
Speaker 1: same with the HTPC.

710
00:47:20,648 --> 00:47:21,470
Speaker 1: same with my laptop.

711
00:47:21,874 --> 00:47:33,650
Speaker 1: Yeah only after six or seven years though Yeah but now I have all these computers like a lot of them that I'm gonna basically have nothing to do with that are 100% fine and they're actually pretty fast.

712
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:38,470
Speaker 1: They're just not fast enough for me and I'm not sure what to do with like this computer.

713
00:47:38,591 --> 00:47:47,314
Speaker 0: If you're a person who needs an HTPC and you are just gonna watch video Like you're not even gonna play any serious games or you're only gonna play like nice 2d games It could be your desktop.

714
00:47:47,414 --> 00:47:48,238
Speaker 0: You could even play.

715
00:47:48,299 --> 00:47:50,670
Speaker 0: it could be like it could be a great desktop.

716
00:47:51,132 --> 00:47:54,430
Speaker 0: It could be like your ultimate the ultimate HTPC for so many people.

717
00:47:54,932 --> 00:47:56,157
Speaker 0: But just for me, it just.

718
00:47:56,358 --> 00:47:59,130
Speaker 0: I couldn't put a better video card in it because it's a low-profile case.

719
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:03,330
Speaker 0: Yep, so I replaced it, but it's perfectly awesome for anyone else.

720
00:48:03,550 --> 00:48:09,230
Speaker 1: So in the old old old days if I had a working computer, I always had all these projects.

721
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:11,581
Speaker 1: So I would immediately turn it into a server of some kind.

722
00:48:11,882 --> 00:48:12,907
Speaker 0: also, you need a Windows license.

723
00:48:12,927 --> 00:48:13,490
Speaker 0: cuz I erased it.

724
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:20,078
Speaker 1: I'm gonna erase it but I would always put like any computer I had that was spare was like, holy shit I have a spare computer.

725
00:48:20,321 --> 00:48:21,109
Speaker 1: What am I gonna do with it?

726
00:48:21,351 --> 00:48:24,743
Speaker 1: And I would just like install software on it and like run the servers on it.

727
00:48:25,064 --> 00:48:30,823
Speaker 1: I just run a counter-strike server Now I just don't bother games don't need that anymore.

728
00:48:30,923 --> 00:48:32,149
Speaker 1: Everything's online and easy.

729
00:48:33,170 --> 00:48:34,156
Speaker 1: Like there's like.

730
00:48:34,176 --> 00:48:36,710
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna host a server on files here in the apart.

731
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:49,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think an RIT my old computer became a web server and then in beacon the old computer became HTPC and another old computer became DNS DHCP Yep, and yet another old computer was a counter-strike server that I ran for a while that no one use.

732
00:48:50,052 --> 00:48:51,710
Speaker 0: It's like we kept doing stuff with old computers.

733
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:56,707
Speaker 0: But now I only need two PCs the desktop and the HTPC.

734
00:48:56,747 --> 00:48:57,490
Speaker 0: I don't need any more.

735
00:48:57,718 --> 00:49:06,998
Speaker 1: Yeah and what's interesting is all the other technology because you know in general like like I have all these electronics that are 100% functional and that I use occasionally.

736
00:49:07,379 --> 00:49:08,863
Speaker 1: but I've bought better versions of like.

737
00:49:09,144 --> 00:49:10,608
Speaker 1: we have these fancy microphones.

738
00:49:10,648 --> 00:49:11,190
Speaker 1: we bought right.

739
00:49:11,672 --> 00:49:13,479
Speaker 1: We bought them to upgrade from the old.

740
00:49:13,941 --> 00:49:16,250
Speaker 1: good, but now we have money and we know what we're doing.

741
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,501
Speaker 1: We're getting better microphones microphones those old microphones.

742
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:20,083
Speaker 1: The sm57s are fine.

743
00:49:22,512 --> 00:49:24,742
Speaker 1: They're literally as good as they were when we bought them.

744
00:49:25,284 --> 00:49:28,899
Speaker 0: We just don't use them Good use them as someone comes over to record.

745
00:49:28,919 --> 00:49:29,682
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need them.

746
00:49:30,084 --> 00:49:31,490
Speaker 0: What about the Radio Shack ones?

747
00:49:32,114 --> 00:49:33,321
Speaker 1: Those I think I just threw away.

748
00:49:33,342 --> 00:49:34,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're so wasteful.

749
00:49:34,971 --> 00:49:37,298
Speaker 1: Yeah, those those were terrible microphones.

750
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,388
Speaker 1: like they were not worth any amount of money.

751
00:49:40,508 --> 00:49:42,842
Speaker 1: in retrospect We were better off with the Logitech.

752
00:49:42,862 --> 00:49:44,912
Speaker 1: because I've listened to the old geek nights I've been remastering them.

753
00:49:44,932 --> 00:49:51,590
Speaker 1: those Radio Shack microphones were worse than the Logitech stick mic because they cost any amount of money and they weren't better.

754
00:49:53,010 --> 00:49:57,485
Speaker 1: But like all the mixers we've gone through a bunch of mixers and I gave away.

755
00:49:57,605 --> 00:50:03,434
Speaker 1: every time we upgraded the geek nights mixer I gave away the previous mixer to someone and They used it.

756
00:50:03,454 --> 00:50:05,309
Speaker 1: as far as I can tell I hope they used it.

757
00:50:05,430 --> 00:50:09,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, I gave the old the last analog mixer the giant one that we used to bring to conventions.

758
00:50:10,393 --> 00:50:11,825
Speaker 1: I gave that to one of our old doorman.

759
00:50:12,931 --> 00:50:13,834
Speaker 1: He's like an aspiring DJ.

760
00:50:13,894 --> 00:50:15,320
Speaker 1: I was like, hey you want this giant mixer?

761
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:16,023
Speaker 1: and he was like, fuck.

762
00:50:16,063 --> 00:50:16,404
Speaker 1: Yeah.

763
00:50:16,645 --> 00:50:17,910
Speaker 0: All right, go for it, dude.

764
00:50:19,111 --> 00:50:20,822
Speaker 0: So he'll saw it on Craigslist or something.

765
00:50:20,842 --> 00:50:22,050
Speaker 1: I think he was using it.

766
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:22,904
Speaker 1: I think he wanted to use it.

767
00:50:23,087 --> 00:50:27,102
Speaker 1: good But most of the tech I have seems worthless.

768
00:50:27,182 --> 00:50:29,510
Speaker 1: that even though it's perfectly functional.

769
00:50:30,293 --> 00:50:35,747
Speaker 1: most of it No one would want and I can't come up with good ways to get rid of it.

770
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:37,957
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I don't know what to do about that.

771
00:50:37,977 --> 00:50:39,766
Speaker 0: You go on the old list of Craig.

772
00:50:39,786 --> 00:50:43,782
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's Facebook just launched a Craigslist competitor today.

773
00:50:43,802 --> 00:50:45,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'm thinking maybe I'll use that right.

774
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:46,755
Speaker 0: So actually this happened.

775
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,262
Speaker 1: we could do the geek nights Luke, right?

776
00:50:48,504 --> 00:50:49,750
Speaker 0: So this happened to me today, right?

777
00:50:49,850 --> 00:50:54,249
Speaker 0: So I'm not a big fan of worst buy or the store that is not the best buy.

778
00:50:54,571 --> 00:50:59,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but I'm trying to get rid of my iPhone 6 cuz I just got the iPhone 7, right?

779
00:50:59,650 --> 00:51:00,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just talked about the beginning the show.

780
00:51:00,990 --> 00:51:04,410
Speaker 0: So, you know I could sell it on Craigslist or eBay or something.

781
00:51:04,511 --> 00:51:05,378
Speaker 0: It's a pain in the ass.

782
00:51:05,418 --> 00:51:06,890
Speaker 0: and this places you can do it online.

783
00:51:07,072 --> 00:51:08,727
Speaker 0: Amazon will give you a gift card, right?

784
00:51:09,852 --> 00:51:12,521
Speaker 0: This website giselle.com and there's some other ones.

785
00:51:12,962 --> 00:51:14,247
Speaker 0: be like mail them your phone.

786

Speaker 0: They evaluate it They give you a quote you either accept it or they send you your phone back.

787
00:51:18,611 --> 00:51:19,628

Speaker 0: so Best Buy apparently You can bring your phone in they'll look at it in the store and give you a gift card.

789
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:33,326
Speaker 0: and I'm like Well, you know while I don't like worst buy that's really fucking convenient.

790
00:51:33,366 --> 00:51:38,201
Speaker 0: It's right near my work and The GoPro Hero 5 is out and I'm buying one high up.

Speaker 0: I mean, I'd rather buy it on Amazon, but hey, right?

796
00:51:47,186 --> 00:51:47,890
Speaker 0: Why the fuck not?

797
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:51,384
Speaker 0: It's like, you know turn my iPhone 6 into a GoPro shade something.

798
00:51:51,445 --> 00:51:52,710
Speaker 0: I don't need any more for something.

799
00:51:52,770 --> 00:51:53,874
Speaker 0: I do need great deal.

800
00:51:54,355 --> 00:51:55,017
Speaker 0: What do I care?

801
00:51:55,097 --> 00:51:59,090
Speaker 0: So I was surprised by a great many things at the worst buy.

802
00:51:59,332 --> 00:52:03,805
Speaker 1: Well, I've not been inside a Best Buy in More than five years.

803
00:52:03,825 --> 00:52:16,710
Speaker 0: Yes So the first thing I was very surprised by is that the staff in the cell phone area of the worst buy Were Scarily knowledgeable about phones particularly this this the girl who was like taking care of me.

804
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:18,958
Speaker 0: It's like everyone kept coming to ask her shit.

805
00:52:18,998 --> 00:52:21,768
Speaker 0: Like this dude was like, hey, is there like a 4g phone?

806
00:52:22,691 --> 00:52:23,736
Speaker 0: that's like less than $100.

807
00:52:23,736 --> 00:52:24,880
Speaker 0: like does this one come in red?

808
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:28,374
Speaker 0: and like she just knew everything about like every phone ever and She was there.

809
00:52:28,394 --> 00:52:30,669
Speaker 0: and then so after she evaluates my phone for a bit.

810
00:52:31,252 --> 00:52:38,556
Speaker 0: She's like, alright Best Buy is gonna give you like 70 bucks for this and I'm like, that's not so great But it's a not a hassle.

811
00:52:38,737 --> 00:52:39,901
Speaker 1: you took it didn't ya know?

812
00:52:40,001 --> 00:52:44,253
Speaker 0: I was thinking about taking it and then she was like listen Don't take it.

813
00:52:44,534 --> 00:52:45,920
Speaker 1: She like I'll give you 80 bucks for it.

814
00:52:46,021 --> 00:52:47,005
Speaker 0: No, she's like.

815
00:52:47,286 --> 00:52:49,676
Speaker 0: she's like, you know The screen has some scratches on.

816
00:52:49,696 --> 00:52:51,705
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah, cuz it was my phone for two years.

817
00:52:51,725 --> 00:52:55,018
Speaker 0: It's not a perfect screen It's you know got normal wear and tear on it.

818
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:55,480
Speaker 0: What's the problem?

819
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,504
Speaker 0: You know, what are you expecting?

820
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:57,910
Speaker 0: brand new shiny phones from two?

821
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,397
Speaker 0: Years ago, but she's like.

822
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:02,150
Speaker 0: you could just sell this like anywhere and get way more money for it.

823
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:11,152
Speaker 0: But I'm like, that's such a pain in the ass, though And she's like, all right Look just go somewhere else and if you really if it's too much of a pain in the ass come back and I'll give you the $75.

824
00:53:11,152 --> 00:53:16,611
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the other dude standing next to her was like seriously go use the Giselle calm Like.

825
00:53:17,114 --> 00:53:17,678
Speaker 0: I'm like really?

826
00:53:17,759 --> 00:53:18,161
Speaker 0: All right.

827
00:53:18,423 --> 00:53:19,390
Speaker 0: It's like they really didn't.

828
00:53:20,431 --> 00:53:25,188
Speaker 0: They were really looking out for the customer and not looking out for Best Buy at all in the cell phone department.

829
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:27,937
Speaker 1: Well They're not getting paid that much.

830
00:53:27,978 --> 00:53:30,230
Speaker 0: No, but I'm saying is like look it was a real.

831
00:53:30,270 --> 00:53:32,010
Speaker 0: It's a real hassle to get rid of this fucking phone.

832
00:53:32,071 --> 00:53:33,290
Speaker 0: So I did the Amazon thing.

833
00:53:33,350 --> 00:53:40,100
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna mail it to Amazon and I checked the box that said listen Amazon if you're gonna give me less money for it Don't give me money.

834
00:53:40,463 --> 00:53:41,289
Speaker 0: Just send it back.

835
00:53:42,292 --> 00:53:46,610
Speaker 0: But hopefully they'll give me Amazon credit for it and it supposedly will be like 200 something dollars.

836
00:53:46,751 --> 00:53:56,970
Speaker 1: So interestingly if they like the phone up until my Nexus 5 Every smartphone I've ever had I replaced it because it broke to the point that it was unusable.

837
00:53:57,171 --> 00:53:58,217
Speaker 0: I wonder how that happened.

838
00:53:58,518 --> 00:54:08,730
Speaker 1: also because you bought not iPhones or Because I Upgraded because the old phone was literally completely obsolete like my palm free or my Nexus S?

839
00:54:08,770 --> 00:54:12,212
Speaker 0: Well all my previous iPhones I see the MA Nexus I think.

840
00:54:12,252 --> 00:54:17,085
Speaker 0: I think I handed down my 3g and my 4 and I what did?

841
00:54:17,105 --> 00:54:19,274
Speaker 0: I think I handed down the 5 to someone Else.

842
00:54:19,476 --> 00:54:20,849
Speaker 1: I gave my Nexus 5 to friends.

843
00:54:22,052 --> 00:54:24,403
Speaker 1: My Nexus 4 I also gave to a friend.

844
00:54:24,443 --> 00:54:25,930
Speaker 1: even though the screens broken the phone works.

845
00:54:25,990 --> 00:54:27,790
Speaker 0: So guys I basically handed down.

846
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:34,071
Speaker 0: I've only had this is only my fourth iPhone 3g 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6.

847
00:54:34,071 --> 00:54:35,119
Speaker 0: This is my fifth iPhone.

848
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:36,390
Speaker 0: So I've gotten rid of four phones.

849
00:54:36,551 --> 00:54:39,306
Speaker 0: So like my next I think I handed down 3 and did something else.

850
00:54:39,366 --> 00:54:41,177
Speaker 0: at the other one My Nexus S was low.

851
00:54:41,217 --> 00:54:43,390
Speaker 0: No, I handed down 3 and I've got the fourth one.

852
00:54:43,450 --> 00:54:44,373
Speaker 0: I'm trying to get rid of it.

853
00:54:44,533 --> 00:54:49,167
Speaker 1: My Nexus S was both locked to sprint and CDMA only as it was literally worthless.

854
00:54:49,408 --> 00:54:50,030
Speaker 1: my palm free.

855
00:54:51,098 --> 00:54:51,590
Speaker 1: So it sucks.

856
00:54:51,691 --> 00:55:03,369
Speaker 1: But unless you root it Which is a giant pain in the ass Even though that would be a perfectly fine like remote control like it has Wi-Fi like you just use it You can't activate it without connecting to servers that don't exist anymore.

857
00:55:04,432 --> 00:55:15,324
Speaker 1: So unless I root it and I went online and all the ways to root a palm free Involve using shady ass software that if you install that on a computer I think you're a moron you can start in a virtual machine.

858
00:55:15,706 --> 00:55:18,093
Speaker 0: even then Spare computer.

859
00:55:18,113 --> 00:55:21,825
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have a spare computer you could use for such things.

860
00:55:21,845 --> 00:55:23,069
Speaker 0: Yeah, would you like it?

861
00:55:23,858 --> 00:55:25,876
Speaker 1: I don't care enough Me either.

862
00:55:25,897 --> 00:55:27,451
Speaker 0: That's why I just want to get rid of this shit Even.

863
00:55:27,511 --> 00:55:31,285
Speaker 1: I guess the moral is all the all the non like all the technology.

864
00:55:31,305 --> 00:55:32,570
Speaker 1: I have computers and other things.

865
00:55:33,232 --> 00:55:44,535
Speaker 1: I pretty much almost always just give away things that work to friends who have worse things or I throw away And there's pretty much nothing else I do with old technology I get I need.

866
00:55:44,575 --> 00:55:57,030
Speaker 0: there needs to be something better to do with it there because they like this You know Even though if I can't find the friends that need it There's people that need it as someone out there who can make a ton of use out of the HDVC and I just can't find Them and it's too much of a hassle to find them.

867
00:55:57,070 --> 00:56:06,470
Speaker 1: Yeah especially because I remember we were trying to give stuff away in Craigslist, you know a long time ago and like People would email you and just like never respond when you're like, yeah, you can have it just come pick it up.

868
00:56:06,590 --> 00:56:07,092
Speaker 1: Here's your day.

869
00:56:07,514 --> 00:56:09,402
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not easy to get rid of stuff.

870
00:56:09,442 --> 00:56:10,386
Speaker 0: I'm trying to get rid of stuff.

871
00:56:10,466 --> 00:56:13,846
Speaker 0: So Sign up for the geek night's crate.

872
00:56:14,028 --> 00:56:15,695
Speaker 1: I guess You know.

873
00:56:15,996 --> 00:56:17,622
Speaker 0: and the other thing is I'm a ship it to someone.

874
00:56:17,662 --> 00:56:19,930
Speaker 0: the shipping cost is so high because it's big and heavy.

875
00:56:20,311 --> 00:56:21,215
Speaker 1: So that was the thing.

876
00:56:21,255 --> 00:56:22,220
Speaker 1: that was the experiment I did.

877
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:23,626
Speaker 1: so we had an old pride bought a new.

878
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:32,366
Speaker 1: we have a real color Laser printer now like a for real one up there like looming over me on the desk And the old printer barely worked and had a lot of problems.

879
00:56:32,426 --> 00:56:33,129
Speaker 1: I was gonna throw it away.

880
00:56:34,834 --> 00:56:47,742
Speaker 1: I wasn't gonna carry it on my bike to the Disposal amnesty thing so I put it downstairs with a regular garbage because our building theoretically will just handle it As an experiment to see if it remained there.

881
00:56:47,762 --> 00:56:49,989
Speaker 1: if they brought it still there, isn't it?

882
00:56:50,410 --> 00:56:54,412
Speaker 1: If they brought it maybe they would bring it back up because it was in a box that our apartment number on it Like.

883
00:56:54,452 --> 00:56:56,542
Speaker 1: maybe they'd bring it up be like, yeah, you can't throw this away.

884
00:56:56,562 --> 00:56:58,110
Speaker 1: I was just curious what would happen to it.

885
00:56:59,271 --> 00:57:00,275
Speaker 1: So what do you think happened to it?

886
00:57:00,295 --> 00:57:00,837
Speaker 0: It's still there.

887
00:57:01,138 --> 00:57:01,660
Speaker 1: No, it's gone.

888
00:57:02,081 --> 00:57:04,410
Speaker 1: Okay, and pretty sure they did it the right way.

889
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:15,327
Speaker 1: so Mm-hmm Apparently buildings can sign up for a thing where the city will take the eways and deal with it And big apartment buildings seem to just do it because people like us move into them and throw away technology all the time.

890
00:57:15,347 --> 00:57:21,730
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Was really happy though because when I went to that end that like throw away your eways.

891
00:57:22,173 --> 00:57:27,049
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a safe disposal event And what they do is they send everyone a piece of paper in the mail.

892
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:31,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, it says on this this is the day and this is the place to bring your shit.

893
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:32,295
Speaker 0: Here's the shit you can bring.

894
00:57:32,355 --> 00:57:33,319
Speaker 0: is the shit you can't bring?

895
00:57:33,419 --> 00:57:39,370
Speaker 0: you can do it year-round if you go to like these places But they're way out of the way comes to your neighborhood like once or twice a year, right?

896
00:57:39,732 --> 00:57:42,930
Speaker 0: So I walked over there with my stuff in a bag and just handed it to them and walked away.

897
00:57:43,031 --> 00:57:44,950
Speaker 0: But there was a line of cars down the street.

898
00:57:44,991 --> 00:57:53,150
Speaker 0: Yeah That was with cones and there was a whole teams of people sorting everything like the people I interacted with were real pro.

899
00:57:54,152 --> 00:57:54,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, like.

900
00:57:54,976 --> 00:57:57,265
Speaker 1: he's like so much you got and I was like a bunch of stuff.

901
00:57:57,306 --> 00:57:58,350
Speaker 1: He's like, alright, let's go one by one.

902
00:57:58,390 --> 00:58:01,949
Speaker 1: I was like got a bunch of CFLs and he's like, alright, we'll take those and he took it.

903
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:03,034
Speaker 0: They didn't even ask me.

904
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:04,039
Speaker 0: they were just like what you got.

905
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:04,782
Speaker 0: Alright, see you.

906
00:58:05,003 --> 00:58:05,345
Speaker 0: You're good.

907
00:58:05,626 --> 00:58:05,867
Speaker 0: Yep.

908
00:58:06,068 --> 00:58:06,389
Speaker 1: Well, okay.

909
00:58:07,152 --> 00:58:19,469
Speaker 1: So if someone came up next to me and they were like, so I got a bunch of scrap steel and a Bunch of paint and he was like, alright, I'll deal with the pain Wait here and we're gonna get a got it and they like did a thing.

910
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:28,023
Speaker 1: But they didn't check IDs of anyone who walked up or biked up and they were very thoroughly Checking the IDs of everyone who drove up.

911
00:58:28,183 --> 00:58:28,766
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

912
00:58:28,847 --> 00:58:31,797
Speaker 1: Yeah interesting Cuz I went around like I took some pictures like checking it out.

913
00:58:32,158 --> 00:58:35,730
Speaker 1: the line of cars coming into this thing was crazy long.

914
00:58:36,051 --> 00:58:41,669
Speaker 0: Well, cuz they bet it's so hard to get rid of your shit and they have an event like hey everyone all that shit You normally can't get rid of it for free.

915
00:58:41,871 --> 00:58:43,730
Speaker 0: We're just gonna take it off your hands for free.

916
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,497
Speaker 0: All you have to do is bring it to this place.

917
00:58:45,557 --> 00:58:51,030
Speaker 0: and this time you were a resident of New York City and it's like everyone Is like holy shit gotta bring my garbage.

918
00:58:51,451 --> 00:58:54,804
Speaker 1: I saw him turn it away the fuck out of my house with Connecticut plates.

919
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:55,748
Speaker 1: cuz I stood there.

920
00:58:55,808 --> 00:59:05,634
Speaker 1: really Yeah, Joe from Connecticut to his story drove in that a Connecticut plate and there's a dude and looked like his wife and he had all these pink hands in the Car.

921
00:59:06,197 --> 00:59:15,650
Speaker 0: and but in Connecticut like, you know, my family's in Connecticut There's a transfer station that is open Every fucking day and you can go there everything for free or that there's some things you have to pay.

922
00:59:15,751 --> 00:59:17,643
Speaker 0: We never had to pay when we went there.

923
00:59:17,683 --> 00:59:18,690
Speaker 1: There's a transfer station.

924
00:59:18,792 --> 00:59:22,329
Speaker 1: I remember in upstate New York There was a limit on how much you could bring to them.

925
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:26,810
Speaker 0: So the transfer station is actually really fun to go to because they have this gigantic trash compactor.

926
00:59:26,931 --> 00:59:29,462
Speaker 0: It looks like something it would be like in a movie at the end like

927
00:59:29,482 --> 00:59:30,688
Speaker 1: at the end of the Brave Little Toaster

928
00:59:30,748 --> 00:59:38,410
Speaker 0: or something We throw the Terminator into it to squish him Yeah, and you can just go over to it and throw your shit right over the edge and then watch it get crushed.

929
00:59:39,211 --> 00:59:41,148
Speaker 0: But certain things you can't throw in there.

930
00:59:41,714 --> 00:59:49,890
Speaker 0: so there's like for example They have a whole shipping container and the shipping container is where you put your computers and your TVs and all that kind of stuff.

931
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,850
Speaker 0: No, you can go in there and there's mad loot in there.

932
00:59:54,231 --> 00:59:59,709
Speaker 0: We went in there and sure there was like a bunch of old compacts and monitors and CR mostly CRT's.

933
01:00:00,231 --> 01:00:09,061
Speaker 0: But I found like a whole box full of like mad old 90s software and it was like I was like, oh shit CD roms is like there's.

934
01:00:09,141 --> 01:00:11,830
Speaker 0: you can go there and get good shit if you just want.

935
01:00:12,314 --> 01:00:19,209
Speaker 1: You know 90s computer shit You know, I think it might have changed because I remember think there were a bunch of charities like just growing up High fighter on CD roms.

936
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:25,536
Speaker 1: I remember there are all these charities that would ostensibly take your computer stuff and then like yeah There is a place that does that.

937
01:00:25,577 --> 01:00:26,643
Speaker 0: I have no idea where it is.

938
01:00:26,683 --> 01:00:27,790
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's not in New York.

939
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:31,690
Speaker 0: It's hard to find it's hard to get your shit, but they would then donate it to like schools and things.

940
01:00:32,032 --> 01:00:41,274
Speaker 1: But I remember the result is that most of those got shut down Because they were basically scams where they would give schools garbage shit old broken computers at least one That wasn't a scam.

941
01:00:41,314 --> 01:00:52,210
Speaker 0: and I remember because I watched the whole video about them and they were smart people like us who were Volunteering in their spare time like taking the good parts out of broken computers and come recombining them to make working computers.

942
01:00:52,551 --> 01:00:53,635
Speaker 1: I think it's time for.

943
01:00:53,776 --> 01:01:04,770
Speaker 1: and they were not selling them for a profit because because specifically we've hit this area For like six years now where computers aren't getting that much faster, and they're basically super durable and invincible.

944
01:01:04,951 --> 01:01:10,170
Speaker 0: I think what's happening is everyone's getting rid of their computers replacing them with phones and tablets and not getting computers.

945
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:16,430
Speaker 0: So now basically is can everyone but gamers and people have to do real work are getting rid of computers.

946
01:01:16,592 --> 01:01:20,096
Speaker 0: And there's a bunch of free computers out there That could use homes.

947
01:01:20,337 --> 01:01:26,090
Speaker 1: Yep, and I feel like you could put those in schools and do a lot of good Or you could put them in a giant supercomputer.

948
01:01:26,931 --> 01:01:28,717
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you can make a bail of cluster.

949
01:01:28,737 --> 01:01:30,723
Speaker 0: I don't think that's the 1996 called.

950
01:01:30,844 --> 01:01:32,369
Speaker 0: It's called Hadoop.

951
01:01:32,429 --> 01:01:42,800

962
01:03:10,511 --> 01:03:29,009
Speaker 1: It is a it's quite a special book and I'm reading it to all of the patrons as an audiobook because that's just the kind of thing I'm doing pretty sure in this third chapter that I don't know if it was just a Sex scene from a fanfic and they changed the proper nouns.

963
01:03:29,594 --> 01:03:30,889
Speaker 1: I don't know how this came to be.

964
01:03:31,050 --> 01:03:43,280
Speaker 1: Maybe the guy was trying to be funny and like push the edge or whatever, but pretty sure Timothy Bradley had an orgasm After touching Simon's whip like I don't know how else to read that.

965
01:03:43,822 --> 01:03:45,245
Speaker 1: I really don't know.

966
01:03:45,265 --> 01:03:48,854

967
01:03:48,894 --> 01:03:53,410
Speaker 1: I'm gonna read this from this is not me reading the book as I am for the audiobook.

968
01:03:53,470 --> 01:03:57,270
Speaker 1: This is me reading it right now after just recorded this episode of Geek Nights.

969
01:03:58,373 --> 01:04:00,109
Speaker 1: Blah blah, where'd you like to go?

970
01:04:01,130 --> 01:04:03,890
Speaker 1: Well, come grab my whip Timothy Bradley.

971
01:04:04,871 --> 01:04:07,199
Speaker 1: Well, it was worth the shot thought Tim anything?

972
01:04:07,239 --> 01:04:10,349
Speaker 1: get away from that walking dynamite truck with biceps in the very least blah blah blah.

973
01:04:10,891 --> 01:04:13,220
Speaker 1: He reached out and grabbed the leather whip.

974
01:04:13,802 --> 01:04:15,810
Speaker 1: it felt as though he'd grabbed a live wire.

975
01:04:16,311 --> 01:04:17,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, he said.

976
01:04:17,334 --> 01:04:19,760
Speaker 1: he felt his hair stand on end.

977
01:04:20,222 --> 01:04:22,548
Speaker 1: energy coursed full throttle through his body.

978
01:04:22,568 --> 01:04:25,235
Speaker 1: a burst Of light zapped through his eyes.

979
01:04:25,697 --> 01:04:30,350
Speaker 1: then everything became a pleasant calm after the silent bang.

980
01:04:31,632 --> 01:04:33,461
Speaker 1: You really shouldn't play around with shocks.

981
01:04:33,481 --> 01:04:35,170
