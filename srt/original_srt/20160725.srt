1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:12,903
Speaker 0: It's Monday July 25th 2016.

2
00:00:12,903 --> 00:00:16,050
Speaker 0: I'm rim, I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,372 --> 00:00:21,658
Speaker 0: the right to repair and the DMCA and all that nonsense in Still a problem.

4
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:25,017
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:27,773 --> 00:00:42,990
Speaker 0: It was raining so hard that when I got off the salt like I was on the subway in the seven train after like ridiculous Delays and like people crammed in everywhere I basically only got on the car because I sort of Shoved people out of the way and elbowed my way on there wedged myself in a corner.

6
00:00:43,533 --> 00:00:58,447
Speaker 0: But then when the train came out of the tunnel into the daylight into the wall of rain the rain hit the subway car so hard that people in the car kind of went like ah and everyone sort Of reacted in a surprising and shocked fashion, which I've never seen people do on the subway before.

7
00:00:58,627 --> 00:00:59,510
Speaker 1: so it was nice and clean.

8
00:00:59,953 --> 00:01:01,749
Speaker 0: Yeah, nice and air-conditioned car wash.

9
00:01:02,712 --> 00:01:11,587
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm actually impressed at how well all the air conditioning and that system is working considering We're riding relatively new train cars even though you saw they're gonna get all new new train cars soon.

10
00:01:11,627 --> 00:01:16,084
Speaker 1: with the bumbleweeds I thought they were just modifying existing cars to put little thingies in between.

11
00:01:16,164 --> 00:01:25,376
Speaker 0: hard to say because the Story looks like I think they're gonna take the oldest rolling stock and replace it with the ones that'll have the sort of articulated Open framework and less seats.

12
00:01:25,657 --> 00:01:25,798
Speaker 1: well.

13
00:01:25,818 --> 00:01:29,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you always assume the newest cars replaced the oldest cars.

14
00:01:29,451 --> 00:01:32,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, except apparently I guess the C train will never get anything replaced.

15
00:01:33,071 --> 00:01:33,452
Speaker 1: Why not?

16
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:38,990
Speaker 0: the C train has the word the oldest worst rolling stock in the entire system then aren't isn't that first in line to get?

17
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:39,492
Speaker 1: Replaced?

18
00:01:39,633 --> 00:01:39,955
Speaker 0: I don't know.

19
00:01:39,996 --> 00:01:42,270
Speaker 0: the C trains weird - they're shorter than the other trains.

20
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:46,923
Speaker 0: Okay, you know what you don't know about the C. Have you ever ridden the C on purpose?

21
00:01:47,445 --> 00:01:49,438
Speaker 1: I've ridden other blue I don't know.

22
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:55,790
Speaker 1: I've ridden blue trains, but I've never ridden a blue train where it mattered which one I took unless it was the e.

23
00:01:56,231 --> 00:01:58,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, the e is the useful one.

24
00:01:58,459 --> 00:01:59,663
Speaker 0: the a is the a one.

25
00:01:59,683 --> 00:02:02,414
Speaker 1: unless you're going to Brooklyn like if I'm taking a blue Train it's either.

26
00:02:02,434 --> 00:02:04,907
Speaker 1: I need the e or I need any blue train.

27
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,990
Speaker 1: Yep I don't think and I don't know which one I'm on.

28
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:12,730
Speaker 0: I'll bet you haven't ridden any train cuz the train kind of sucks like a lot of e trains to go to the no.

29
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:15,298
Speaker 0: No, sorry the C. The C. You're probably never ridden.

30
00:02:15,478 --> 00:02:24,170
Speaker 0: I mean, I've just if I have I didn't you know see is notably shitty Okay, but anyway, so I was in the beach this weekend and something strange happened.

31
00:02:24,954 --> 00:02:39,718
Speaker 0: I was at Russo's, you know that place like we always do standing there with Emily we're waiting for our Russo sandwiches to get finished by the ladies behind the counter and Suddenly and what looks like an employee of Russo's Wearing a Santa hat walk.

32
00:02:39,979 --> 00:02:42,046
Speaker 1: I had to head in July

33
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:51,300
Speaker 0: walks up to us holding a bunch of things that they call sand scrapers that are like this as-seen-on-tv thing to get sand off your feet and

34
00:02:52,304 --> 00:02:53,711
Speaker 1: Three and stupid big

35
00:02:53,791 --> 00:03:00,599
Speaker 0: blocks of Boar's Head cheese Like wrapped up packaged Boar's Head cheese, and they're like Merry Christmas and they hand it to us.

36
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:08,062
Speaker 0: They handed you free cheese like three huge blocks of cheese and these Expired.

37
00:03:08,464 --> 00:03:09,729
Speaker 0: it expires next year.

38
00:03:09,809 --> 00:03:10,592
Speaker 0: Like it's fine.

39
00:03:10,873 --> 00:03:12,580
Speaker 1: Why didn't they give it to the units to everybody?

40
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:19,304
Speaker 0: So we're looking at her and Emily's like, oh, no, thanks, you know, cuz like you do when someone's more you Yeah, and gives you cheese.

41
00:03:19,545 --> 00:03:22,976
Speaker 0: that is either a scam or they stole that cheese.

42
00:03:22,996 --> 00:03:23,478
Speaker 1: That's right.

43
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:24,020
Speaker 1: We don't want that.

44
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:24,543
Speaker 1: What is going on?

45
00:03:24,563 --> 00:03:26,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they're like, it's Christmas in July.

46
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:27,420
Speaker 0: It's free.

47
00:03:27,661 --> 00:03:28,323
Speaker 0: You can take it.

48
00:03:28,604 --> 00:03:38,000
Speaker 0: and then I noticed that there's other Russo's people walking around giving everyone in the store like three or four Giant blocks of cheese all like so big you need your own deli slicer to cut it.

49
00:03:38,141 --> 00:03:39,738
Speaker 0: No, like half a pound or a pound each.

50
00:03:40,505 --> 00:03:42,200
Speaker 1: So like the kind of block you would buy in the grocery.

51
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:44,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a grocery store block, but that's a lot of free cheese.

52
00:03:44,695 --> 00:03:49,397
Speaker 0: when I get free cheese It's always like a tiny free cheese and Boar's Head is like middle-of-the-road cheese.

53
00:03:49,417 --> 00:03:58,288
Speaker 0: So We were so skeptical that we engaged in like a minutes worth of conversation like, okay This is free.

54
00:03:58,308 --> 00:04:00,140
Speaker 0: You're just giving me this cheese.

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,907
Speaker 1: Alright, where did this cheese come from?

56
00:04:03,229 --> 00:04:03,811
Speaker 0: Sure.

57
00:04:03,831 --> 00:04:05,658
Speaker 0: And then later on we finally get her food.

58
00:04:05,698 --> 00:04:10,998
Speaker 0: as we're leaving I see them walk up to this lady and they're like free cheese and they gave her way better cheese than they gave us.

59
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:16,899
Speaker 0: and She was like, no, no, no, no, no, and they're like, it's free and she's like and she was just as scap as we were.

60
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:20,613
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got a better way to give away your free cheese.

61
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:29,220
Speaker 1: then just walk up to people with a Santa hat But I noticed behind them they had giant boxes of cheese and you should also give people a reason you're giving them free cheese.

62
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,951
Speaker 0: Oh, the reason was Christmas in July.

63
00:04:30,971 --> 00:04:32,380
Speaker 1: That's not a good reason.

64
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:34,075
Speaker 1: Where do they get a money to buy all that cheese?

65
00:04:34,095 --> 00:04:34,640
Speaker 1: for no reason?

66
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:44,080
Speaker 0: so in the background I see one of the employees is standing there looking at another one and they have one of these giant boxes Of cheese open and I see tons more boxes that are obviously cheese.

67
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:44,704
Speaker 1: Where did that?

68
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:45,811
Speaker 1: where did the boxes come from?

69
00:04:45,892 --> 00:04:46,980
Speaker 0: and one of them is like them?

70
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:52,500
Speaker 0: So you're just giving away all this cheese and the other employee just laughs and is like Christmas in July.

71
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:57,049
Speaker 1: So Was it a mistake in delivery?

72
00:04:57,149 --> 00:04:58,375
Speaker 1: Was it stolen cheese?

73
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,400
Speaker 1: Was it mafia cheese?

74
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:02,372
Speaker 1: So on the person who owns Russo's just so wealthy.

75
00:05:02,412 --> 00:05:05,185
Speaker 1: They bought you that much though on the B. Why cheese?

76
00:05:05,225 --> 00:05:06,733
Speaker 1: you could have bought something better than she.

77
00:05:06,753 --> 00:05:18,259
Speaker 0: when I go for my run There's one group of people that are set up on the beach, you know, but they're like beach towels and everything but the beach towels all have snowmen on them and they put up Christmas lights and shit.

78
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:31,859
Speaker 0: and Then while we're laying on the beach Parade drove by in cars on the beach of a bunch of bro-looking people playing Christmas songs and singing Christmas carols while wearing swimsuits and Santa hats.

79
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:34,444
Speaker 0: and Apparently it was just.

80
00:05:34,644 --> 00:05:49,348
Speaker 0: it was Christmas in July in Wildwood and I can only assume that the cities of Wildwood's just gave all the businesses incentives to do Christmas in July or something and We just came home and gave all the cheese.

81
00:05:49,368 --> 00:05:49,690
Speaker 0: Let's go to.

82
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:52,947
Speaker 0: his parents were like, hey, we bought you some cheese for the house Thanks for letting us stay here.

83
00:05:52,967 --> 00:05:53,893
Speaker 0: and they were like, oh, thanks.

84
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:54,678
Speaker 0: They were really excited.

85
00:05:56,745 --> 00:05:58,700
Speaker 0: Hey, it was free, you know his parents.

86
00:05:58,800 --> 00:05:59,564
Speaker 1: Yes, you chose.

87
00:05:59,765 --> 00:06:02,960
Speaker 1: you went shopping to buy me a present and you bought three blocks of cheese.

88
00:06:03,422 --> 00:06:05,691
Speaker 0: I think if I gave them anything they would be excited.

89
00:06:05,731 --> 00:06:07,900
Speaker 0: if nothing else they try to sell it at that garage sale.

90
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,934
Speaker 1: I'm just saying to be like if someone came up to me.

91
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:12,360
Speaker 1: It was like got your present three blocks of cheese.

92
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,879
Speaker 1: They'd be like, where did you get this free cheese for?

93
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:18,579
Speaker 0: We were like Russo's and they were like we got it from Russo's for you and they were like awesome Thanks.

94
00:06:18,881 --> 00:06:25,859
Speaker 0: and then she immediately caught one of them up to like feed Kaylee make a snack for herself and kept the other two because That was that was how that went down.

95
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:31,153
Speaker 0: And Okay, yeah, I believe me I am.

96
00:06:31,555 --> 00:06:35,394
Speaker 0: it's interesting watching New Yorkers interact with any human being.

97
00:06:35,414 --> 00:06:50,279
Speaker 0: whoever talks to them especially offering something like my shields are so strong at this point that a literal like magical godlike Savior of humanity could come down do magic in front of me and offer me gold and I would be like.

98
00:06:52,462 --> 00:06:53,827
Speaker 0: I don't really want to talk to you.

99
00:06:53,967 --> 00:06:54,449
Speaker 0: Mr.

100
00:06:54,810 --> 00:06:55,171
Speaker 0: Avoiding.

101
00:06:55,271 --> 00:06:57,800
Speaker 0: I can't act like trying to get around them in the street.

102
00:06:59,005 --> 00:06:59,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, got any news.

103
00:07:01,881 --> 00:07:07,620
Speaker 1: So I guess the news of the day is that Verizon bought Yahoo's core business.

104
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,124
Speaker 1: So what does that even fucking mean?

105
00:07:09,305 --> 00:07:14,680
Speaker 0: once valued at a hundred and twenty five billion like Yahoo's web assets were sold to Verizon for?

106
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:17,030
Speaker 0: 4.8 billion, right?

107
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:26,860
Speaker 1: So Yahoo the US company Consisted of a a bunch of internet shit like Yahoo Sports Yahoo weather Yahoo websites Yahoo Finance flicker etc.

108
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:27,442
Speaker 1: Etc.

109
00:07:28,125 --> 00:07:33,188
Speaker 1: right it consisted of an investment in Alibaba Like 15% of Alibaba.

110
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:38,232
Speaker 0: Yeah no, you guys gonna realize how incestuous all these companies actually are.

111
00:07:38,272 --> 00:07:45,634
Speaker 1: like a lot of companies own big chumps like when you buy if you buy a Percent of Yahoo, you're actually buying one over 15% of Alibaba.

112
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:55,629
Speaker 1: Anyway, so it also Yahoo US owns 35 and a half percent of Yahoo Japan Which is actually a separate company.

113
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:56,756
Speaker 1: that's actually successful.

114
00:07:57,098 --> 00:08:10,232
Speaker 1: Yep So basically all the parts of Yahoo America us that weren't Investments and other things that were just web stuff God sold to Verizon for like five billion dollars.

115
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:20,655
Speaker 0: Apparently they tried to include the Alibaba stuff And the only reason they couldn't according to these articles is that they were afraid they'd pay more taxes if they did So anyway, so Yahoo is basically split into two parts.

116
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:32,086
Speaker 1: one is just a company That's nothing but investments like all right like a holding company and the other part is the operating company Which like he does things like software and websites Which is the part that Verizon bought.

117
00:08:32,486 --> 00:08:37,337
Speaker 1: and Verizon already bought AOL for a similar amount You know a while ago.

118
00:08:38,042 --> 00:08:43,919
Speaker 1: So and you think just the web part of AOL and just the part of Yahoo that actually do internet stuff, right?

119
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,660
Speaker 1: Like Yahoo mail AOL mail pretty equivalent in value pretty close, right?

120
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:53,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if there is one company I trusted the least to do anything with those assets is Verizon.

121
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:56,530
Speaker 1: Well, I mean not the least but it's way down there.

122
00:08:57,011 --> 00:08:59,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a highly trusted operation.

123
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:03,108
Speaker 1: So Yeah, that's probably bad.

124
00:09:03,529 --> 00:09:06,601
Speaker 1: if you use any Yahoo things and I actually use a few Yahoo things I'm

125
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:20,116
Speaker 0: probably the one that the only one that I actually worry about is flicker because flicker is like the core of my photograph sharing and archiving technology Mmm, like I use flicker like as my 100% core workflow.

126
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:27,580
Speaker 0: I process stuff through Lightroom, but in the end the actual photos I put them all on flicker because that's how I share them.

127
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:28,456
Speaker 0: That's what I use it for.

128
00:09:29,182 --> 00:09:34,340
Speaker 1: I highly doubt they'll kill it, but it could be like Verizon flicker and it could you know could just get bad.

129
00:09:34,460 --> 00:09:36,070
Speaker 1: It'd be covered in ads and turn shitty.

130
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:36,492
Speaker 1: Who knows?

131
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:37,779
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's other options.

132
00:09:38,463 --> 00:09:41,175
Speaker 0: The only the only thing is all the stuff that's happened over the years.

133
00:09:41,215 --> 00:09:43,704
Speaker 0: flickers just remained Mostly running.

134
00:09:43,744 --> 00:09:49,369
Speaker 0: it has some problems like occasionally old photos just won't load for a while And then they float again like a couple days later.

135
00:09:49,389 --> 00:09:50,354
Speaker 1: I never seen that.

136
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:51,700
Speaker 0: a lot of people complain about that.

137
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,353
Speaker 0: That's a really common problem that's been going on for a couple years now.

138
00:09:54,795 --> 00:09:55,860
Speaker 1: You can always use smug mug.

139
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,503
Speaker 1: It's not free.

140
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:58,090
Speaker 0: But you know this Lakers not free.

141
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:03,736
Speaker 1: this I mean, but it's a way, you know, there's a lot of choices Yeah, but flicker is the best of them still so far.

142
00:10:04,038 --> 00:10:06,220
Speaker 0: Sure Let's see how this all goes down.

143
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:12,680
Speaker 0: This is a situation where I would be much more worried about the antitrust and neutrality aspects of this?

144
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:13,342
Speaker 1: No, I'm not.

145
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:21,329
Speaker 0: well see the thing is yeah, I am worried would be if Yahoo wasn't already like this sinking ship Well tethered to another.

146
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:21,530
Speaker 1: I'm.

147
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:26,890
Speaker 1: obviously if I was in charge of antitrust I wouldn't allow this but they already allowed NBC Comcast.

148
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:29,498
Speaker 1: So it's like well, this is way less bad than that.

149
00:10:29,819 --> 00:10:31,121
Speaker 1: So Really?

150
00:10:31,162 --> 00:10:37,868
Speaker 1: They should not allow a company period any corporation in the United States or anywhere to do more than one thing Period.

151
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:40,643
Speaker 1: that's how it would be One thing.

152
00:10:40,844 --> 00:10:46,840
Speaker 1: well, for example, if you're McDonald's you sell you you make food and sell food, right?

153
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,511
Speaker 0: What if I make video games and social media software?

154
00:10:49,852 --> 00:10:50,836
Speaker 1: No, you shouldn't be allowed to do that.

155
00:10:50,856 --> 00:10:51,660
Speaker 0: What's the difference?

156
00:10:52,603 --> 00:10:52,964
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

157
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:53,466
Speaker 1: what's the difference?

158
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:56,034
Speaker 1: what's the difference between making two different kinds of things?

159
00:10:56,295 --> 00:10:57,920
Speaker 0: what defines what a kind of thing is?

160
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,167
Speaker 0: It's just software Me.

161
00:11:00,187 --> 00:11:00,268
Speaker 1: Okay.

162
00:11:00,551 --> 00:11:05,377
Speaker 1: Yeah businesses You can't make clothing and food.

163
00:11:06,381 --> 00:11:07,123
Speaker 0: It's so different.

164
00:11:07,284 --> 00:11:12,660
Speaker 0: self-driving cars because that requires lots of software that is also used for very very different things.

165
00:11:13,723 --> 00:11:16,634
Speaker 1: You're basically saying because this is semantic issue of defining.

166
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:17,478
Speaker 1: What's a different thing?

167
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:20,099
Speaker 1: You're gonna get it you're gonna let it stop you from.

168
00:11:21,286 --> 00:11:23,402
Speaker 1: You know the common-sense definition of what.

169
00:11:23,523 --> 00:11:33,560
Speaker 0: I would go much more simply and say that mergers of companies that are above a certain size are met with extreme Skepticism and the more disparate their assets are the higher the bar.

170
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:42,985
Speaker 1: I can actually even go so far as to say we should not allow a company to exist with assets greater than X Period and it's a company becomes greater than X Even if it does only one thing

171
00:11:43,065 --> 00:11:44,229
Speaker 0: how to pull split

172
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:46,256
Speaker 1: it into two companies that both do the counter

173
00:11:46,316 --> 00:11:46,677
Speaker 0: point.

174
00:11:46,958 --> 00:11:52,120
Speaker 0: a lot of the Things we use probably would never been created if there weren't companies that had that much asset under control.

175
00:11:53,141 --> 00:11:57,520
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe not like a lot of the good lot a lot of stuff Google did we really just never been done ever?

176
00:11:58,022 --> 00:11:58,745
Speaker 1: Maybe maybe not?

177
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:02,239
Speaker 0: probably not not unless you had governments doing it and you know, that's not gonna happen.

178
00:12:02,747 --> 00:12:06,269
Speaker 0: I'm okay, you know You never know just saying you're uh, you're overly simplistic.

179
00:12:06,309 --> 00:12:12,280
Speaker 0: views on this are in contrast with my much more nuanced views And more nuanced view isn't necessarily better.

180
00:12:13,582 --> 00:12:16,159
Speaker 0: You you fall to the folly of the shortest path.

181
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:18,324
Speaker 1: Shortest path is a quick path.

182
00:12:18,545 --> 00:12:24,160
Speaker 0: Yeah quick path to the opposite of salvation either literal damnation or suicide.

183
00:12:26,082 --> 00:12:30,819
Speaker 0: Well, we'll see welcome we're reading the Prince of Nothing books again, so watch out for they just made a new one.

184
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,807
Speaker 1: I Took a short path right to the end of that book.

185
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:36,800
Speaker 1: I'm I got there faster than rim with my short path.

186
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:42,768
Speaker 0: I took a shorter path because I didn't even read orgs and Craig because I was reading this first But instead of finishing the book at the beach.

187
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,755
Speaker 0: I just laid there at the beach.

188
00:12:44,795 --> 00:12:47,359
Speaker 0: So I embraced the zero guy For a little while.

189
00:12:49,642 --> 00:12:53,977
Speaker 0: So you're damned as well, this is a totally side news, but remembers it.

190
00:12:53,997 --> 00:12:54,580
Speaker 0: remembers of car?

191
00:12:55,263 --> 00:12:57,839
Speaker 1: They're still around I guess but they have a lot of competition now.

192
00:12:58,201 --> 00:13:01,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I've decided like I haven't used that car in a while.

193
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,914
Speaker 1: He's still paying the fee.

194
00:13:03,095 --> 00:13:03,697
Speaker 0: Well, the fee is $70 a year.

195
00:13:05,362 --> 00:13:07,472
Speaker 0: So it's basically nothing but nothing.

196
00:13:07,492 --> 00:13:13,299
Speaker 0: that's a whole video game a brand To video games, but I was paying for it because I used it.

197
00:13:14,463 --> 00:13:18,835
Speaker 0: But I haven't used it at all this year and I'm gonna cancel it like tonight.

198
00:13:18,875 --> 00:13:20,780
Speaker 0: like I decided a zip car is fucking dead.

199
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:24,953
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the reason is zip car is literally worthless.

200
00:13:25,053 --> 00:13:27,200
Speaker 0: It is worse than every other option now.

201
00:13:27,843 --> 00:13:34,655
Speaker 0: So the reasons I used to use zip car were one I don't want to talk to human beings and deal with them trying to sell me bullshit.

202
00:13:34,735 --> 00:13:41,137
Speaker 0: I just want to rent a car Yeah, - I just want to know a set price of what the car takes and just go pick it up with technology.

203
00:13:41,357 --> 00:13:41,979
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm three.

204
00:13:43,542 --> 00:13:47,899
Speaker 0: I pretty much want to pick up a car near my house Like I'll go to my house pick up the car.

205
00:13:48,323 --> 00:13:50,502
Speaker 0: That way I can rent it for the exact period of time I need.

206
00:13:50,523 --> 00:13:56,392
Speaker 0: it's like I pick it up Friday after work drive to the beach I drop it off Sunday at like 10 o'clock at night and I only pay for that time.

207
00:13:56,412 --> 00:13:58,499
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and that was great.

208
00:13:59,282 --> 00:14:04,358
Speaker 0: But and back then it was cheaper than rental cars or at least the same cost as a rental car.

209
00:14:04,418 --> 00:14:11,740
Speaker 0: free gas Yeah or it caused more than rental car but the free gas and all the other things evened it out or the Convenience was worth the slight difference in price.

210
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:16,420
Speaker 0: Over the last couple years the prices of zip car have gotten up to where you know what?

211
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:26,404
Speaker 0: It would have cost for me to rent the cheapest possible zip car for the weekend last weekend to go to Wildwood hundreds four hundred and seventy eight dollars Mm-hmm.

212
00:14:26,425 --> 00:14:32,609
Speaker 0: So now outside of New York, I could rent a car for the weekend for like Sixty bucks, but it's New York.

213
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,517
Speaker 0: So the cheapest I could get was 200 bucks.

214
00:14:35,844 --> 00:14:42,300
Speaker 0: The problem is if I rent from a non zip car place You have to rent it from somewhere that won't let you drop it off on Sunday.

215
00:14:42,421 --> 00:14:45,920
Speaker 0: No, no rental car place will let you get a rental that ends on Sunday.

216
00:14:46,463 --> 00:14:57,618
Speaker 0: So you pretty much have to keep it till Monday and then drop it off Mm-hmm, but getting the car like Friday afternoon to Monday morning from like White Plains was Basically half the price of a zip car.

217
00:14:58,302 --> 00:15:01,739
Speaker 0: So I took the train up to White Plains picked up the car picked up Emily because her office is up there.

218
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:08,859
Speaker 0: Drove to Wildwood family's office when Emily get the car Because I drive a lot more than her and I don't think she really wanted to drive the car.

219
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:09,398
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

220
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:12,620
Speaker 0: I mean most of our friends in New York like Judith doesn't even know how to drive.

221
00:15:13,002 --> 00:15:15,380
Speaker 1: Why don't you just take the train to Jersey and get a car?

222
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:19,780
Speaker 0: I thought about that and it ended up being much more a pain in the ass for a bunch of traffic reasons.

223
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,379
Speaker 1: You just take the path train then get a car.

224
00:15:21,571 --> 00:15:23,488
Speaker 0: Yeah We did that once and actually it took.

225
00:15:23,629 --> 00:15:29,874
Speaker 0: it ended up taking way longer than what we did now Mm-hmm because I could skirt New York City to a surprising degree from coming from the.

226
00:15:29,914 --> 00:15:36,760
Speaker 0: but anyway in the month in the Monday morning I drove Emily to work and then I just dropped the car off like at North White Plains And then I took the train to work and I worked out fine.

227
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:43,744
Speaker 0: But I think what killed zip car is that one remember zip car got bought I didn't forget watch Which rental car company owns them.

228
00:15:44,606 --> 00:15:46,612
Speaker 0: and once that happens zip car just kind of sucks.

229
00:15:46,953 --> 00:15:56,652
Speaker 0: and it got worse and worse and worse - Zip car wanted to be sold to people who live in cities who don't own a car But occasionally need to use a car to like do something.

230
00:15:56,652 --> 00:16:00,539
Speaker 0: 90% of those use cases are now covered by uber.

231
00:16:01,643 --> 00:16:03,079
Speaker 1: Uber is not gonna take you to the beach though

232
00:16:03,328 --> 00:16:11,666
Speaker 0: No but zip car wanted to sell zip car to the kinds of people like their business model was basically a Shit version of what uber does now like

233
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:12,309
Speaker 1: anyone

234
00:16:12,329 --> 00:16:14,838
Speaker 0: who would use a zip car for the business model zip car had.

235
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,437
Speaker 0: now We'll just use uber.

236
00:16:17,221 --> 00:16:20,231
Speaker 0: Everyone who had zip car actually used it the way we used it of.

237
00:16:20,472 --> 00:16:25,010
Speaker 0: we actually just want to rent cars like a normal car Rental and they can't make money with that.

238
00:16:25,472 --> 00:16:27,220
Speaker 0: So I think zip car is just completely fucked.

239
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:30,149
Speaker 1: The thing is we need uber long, right?

240
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:30,390
Speaker 1: I don't.

241
00:16:30,410 --> 00:16:33,120
Speaker 1: yeah, I would never take a car to go somewhere short.

242
00:16:33,301 --> 00:16:39,167
Speaker 1: I don't only take a car to go somewhere in another town, but an uber is not gonna take me to like Pennsylvania.

243
00:16:39,329 --> 00:16:40,180
Speaker 0: it's like cars on demand.

244
00:16:40,301 --> 00:16:49,495
Speaker 0: I want an uber where someone drives a car to my apartment at a certain time Leaves it with me and then comes to pick the car back up on another date at another time.

245
00:16:49,515 --> 00:16:50,097
Speaker 0: Hmm.

246
00:16:50,298 --> 00:16:51,687
Speaker 0: That's what I want That's not bad.

247
00:16:51,869 --> 00:16:52,779
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would actually be great.

248
00:16:53,523 --> 00:16:59,643
Speaker 0: So uber killed zip car and while zip car still exists Beware you who use it.

249
00:16:59,663 --> 00:17:11,746
Speaker 0: It is basically worthless at this point and it's interesting how that like the use case like a use case that a huge number of pretty affluent people in a major city have is Literally not served.

250
00:17:11,766 --> 00:17:25,060
Speaker 0: like there is no solution for people like us It is literally go to a shitto place like Hertz and go through the normal garbage Terrible process talking to human beings and dealing with the crap or buy a car and pay to park it somewhere every month.

251
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,534
Speaker 0: Yep, so if we used a rental car if we used a zip car.

252
00:17:28,554 --> 00:17:30,060
Speaker 0: with the current prices four times a year.

253
00:17:30,381 --> 00:17:37,189
Speaker 0: It's cheaper to own a car even with paying for the hundred fifty bucks a month for parking and the insurance And everything and the maintenance.

254
00:17:37,229 --> 00:17:37,450
Speaker 1: Yep.

255
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:38,615
Speaker 0: I did the van.

256
00:17:38,656 --> 00:17:39,479
Speaker 1: It's a really nice car.

257
00:17:39,822 --> 00:17:43,747
Speaker 0: I know it'd be it could be a crappy car Who cares like some used piece of crap.

258
00:17:44,109 --> 00:17:51,540
Speaker 0: actually if I did that I'd probably get like a minivan Because then we can bring all our friends to places and it actually would be really worthwhile.

259
00:17:51,881 --> 00:17:58,900
Speaker 0: Why not get like, you know, one of those I can't can't have more than like 12 seats Or then it doesn't count as a consumer van.

260
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:03,300
Speaker 1: I'm saying like that, you know the church van where it's like three benches and can fit a ton of people.

261
00:18:03,844 --> 00:18:04,589
Speaker 0: Oh, I see what you're thinking.

262
00:18:04,609 --> 00:18:05,717
Speaker 0: Just why don't we just get a school bus?

263
00:18:07,842 --> 00:18:10,340
Speaker 0: They get like one mile per gallon, I guess that's the problem.

264
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,848
Speaker 1: You need a special license to drive.

265
00:18:12,888 --> 00:18:14,093
Speaker 0: that I could get that license.

266
00:18:14,114 --> 00:18:15,359
Speaker 0: I think is C license or whatever.

267
00:18:16,904 --> 00:18:23,779
Speaker 0: But if we get regular rental cars We would have to use a rental car like 14 times a year and then it's cheaper to own the car.

268
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:27,034
Speaker 0: I don't think we use them 14 times a year more like four.

269
00:18:27,295 --> 00:18:31,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, thus Zip cars dead in other news.

270
00:18:31,293 --> 00:18:31,634
Speaker 0: Let's see.

271
00:18:31,654 --> 00:18:32,880
Speaker 0: What other tech news did we have?

272
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,959
Speaker 0: So something interesting is happening with the EU.

273
00:18:37,682 --> 00:19:17,165
Speaker 0: The European Union is going to basically pay to have its own engineers Like the government that the the people who do like security auditing are going to do an audit of Apache and key pass specifically, okay The rationale is that those two open source or open projects are used very widely Both by government agencies and the private sector and also just the public and they decided that it would be a public good to use taxpayer money to have an independent body of Professionals audit and check on the security of those things and generate a report and work with both of those projects to make them better From a security standpoint.

274
00:19:17,185 --> 00:19:19,393
Speaker 0: All right, this is kind of amazing.

275
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:21,080
Speaker 0: It's kind of it's actually gonna be a really good thing.

276
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,244
Speaker 1: They're open source things.

277
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:22,906
Speaker 1: do whatever you want.

278
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:27,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's I don't know if this has ever happened before.

279
00:19:27,321 --> 00:19:40,668
Speaker 0: I think the only times that I can find evidence of a government entity doing auditing of open source software is If they're auditing a specific use of that software within another company Se Linux.

280
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:42,442
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, but who?

281
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:43,927
Speaker 0: who audited that specifically?

282
00:19:43,967 --> 00:19:44,650
Speaker 0: and where's the report?

283
00:19:44,810 --> 00:19:47,560
Speaker 1: It's the NSA's version of the Linux kernel.

284
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I'm saying where's when's the last like independent audit of its security?

285
00:19:52,513 --> 00:19:53,335
Speaker 0: It's continuous.

286
00:19:53,376 --> 00:19:53,857
Speaker 1: It doesn't end.

287
00:19:53,897 --> 00:19:54,680
Speaker 1: they do it all the time.

288
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:55,927
Speaker 0: It's is there a report.

289
00:19:56,027 --> 00:19:56,872
Speaker 0: It's a living me to it.

290
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:58,100
Speaker 1: I don't know if they have a report.

291
00:19:58,341 --> 00:20:02,320
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, this is the NSA has a fork of Linux that they continuously maintain.

292
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:04,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, and probably put holes in for us to get.

293
00:20:04,551 --> 00:20:06,200
Speaker 0: did you trust the NSA hundred percent?

294
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,640
Speaker 1: Se Linux is like the real deal.

295
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:14,676
Speaker 0: Well se Linux is the thing that most bullshit most Linux people who are system administrators.

296
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:16,321
Speaker 0: in my experience open source It's not.

297
00:20:16,362 --> 00:20:16,823
Speaker 1: there's no.

298
00:20:17,044 --> 00:20:24,360
Speaker 0: most people I know and like every company I've ever like looked at their servers Se Linux is disabled because someone runs into a problem.

299
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,713
Speaker 0: It doesn't know how to fix it and the solution on like some garbage stack exchange.

300
00:20:27,773 --> 00:20:29,540
Speaker 0: answer is just turn se Linux off.

301
00:20:29,781 --> 00:20:34,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, the real answer is the software that you're trying to run on that secure kernel is not secure.

302
00:20:35,826 --> 00:20:37,259
Speaker 1: Edit that software to make it secure.

303
00:20:37,621 --> 00:20:39,347
Speaker 0: Actually, I found 90% of the time.

304
00:20:39,407 --> 00:20:42,477
Speaker 0: the real reason was your clock is off and I see Linux freaks out.

305
00:20:42,557 --> 00:20:44,365
Speaker 0: if timestamps are messed Up, it's also her problem.

306
00:20:44,385 --> 00:20:48,978
Speaker 0: That's like the movie that nine times out of ten if se Linux doesn't work It's because you didn't set up NTP.

307
00:20:49,842 --> 00:21:00,968
Speaker 0: Anyway, but this is cool and it kind of lets, you know, a lot of people in General especially lately because they're you know people getting their Twitter hacked or whatever They want.

308
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,780
Speaker 1: anyone says something was hacked.

309
00:21:02,961 --> 00:21:04,310
Speaker 0: It really means you had terrible password.

310
00:21:04,350 --> 00:21:05,840
Speaker 1: someone guessed your stupid password.

311
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,943
Speaker 1: Yeah You told it to some.

312
00:21:07,064 --> 00:21:15,592
Speaker 1: or you use the same password on multiple sites or you like you clicked Oh off Yes on something stupid and gave permission to some app to use your shit.

313
00:21:15,712 --> 00:21:15,953
Speaker 0: Yep.

314
00:21:16,414 --> 00:21:22,950
Speaker 0: Now there are password managers and You probably shouldn't use them because while I don't

315
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:26,539
Speaker 1: use anything that stores my password even in an encrypted fashion

316
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:33,801
Speaker 0: now Theoretically a good way to do that would be to have local encryption only of your passwords that are not known to any human in The world.

317
00:21:33,842 --> 00:21:39,680
Speaker 0: sure and the problem is you have to trust the organization that made that software that you run locally, right?

318
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:46,720
Speaker 1: As soon as you store your password, even if it's encrypted You're basically the whole point of a password the password from something, you know into something you have pretty much.

319
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:48,110
Speaker 1: So you're basically now you.

320
00:21:48,231 --> 00:21:53,697
Speaker 1: even if you use two-factor auth It's something you have and something else you have and someone else can just steal and take the to have.

321
00:21:53,717 --> 00:22:01,300
Speaker 0: but if you're gonna do Something like that key pass is probably the best one to use because it is not like last pass or any of those things.

322
00:22:01,622 --> 00:22:04,160
Speaker 0: It is just in it a little encrypted database.

323
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,268
Speaker 0: You can put things in and you could you.

324
00:22:06,288 --> 00:22:07,714
Speaker 0: just you keep it and you manage it.

325
00:22:08,055 --> 00:22:10,919
Speaker 0: never sends your shit anywhere Mm-hmm, so you can go into it.

326
00:22:11,201 --> 00:22:17,025
Speaker 0: like you can have a super complex password and if you somehow forget it or like you have a crazy password for how you use that often.

327
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:25,193
Speaker 0: key pass is so reliable that a lot of Security audit types use it in real organizations and governments use it.

328
00:22:25,473 --> 00:22:27,580
Speaker 1: just use fucking pass phrases.

329
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:31,034
Speaker 1: They're it's they're easy to remember because just a bunch of words.

330
00:22:31,054 --> 00:22:32,340
Speaker 0: So, you know what I use key pass for.

331
00:22:32,905 --> 00:22:48,143
Speaker 0: I don't put my passwords in it but I put other information that I'd like to be confidential because TrueCrypt kind of died as a project and it's a nice way to Have an encrypted container and the only way to unlock mine is both to type in a passphrase and to plug my yubi key into My computer.

332
00:22:48,163 --> 00:22:50,435
Speaker 1: but I'm saying if you need for passwords.

333
00:22:50,455 --> 00:22:52,142
Speaker 1: just use pass phrases You can remember.

334
00:22:52,243 --> 00:22:58,060
Speaker 1: it's hard to remember like ABC 1 2 XY something capital lowercase weird symbol, right?

335
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:04,680
Speaker 1: It's hard to remember but it's easy to remember like a whole sentence Right, like the brown the lazy Fox jumped over the dog or whatever.

336
00:23:04,901 --> 00:23:09,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like that's a crazy fucking long password and it's easy as hell to remember.

337
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,460
Speaker 0: How many of you remember the correct horse battery?

338
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,905
Speaker 1: Exactly something like that.

339
00:23:14,085 --> 00:23:20,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you just use something like that for every different place you log into and You'll be crazy secure.

340
00:23:20,306 --> 00:23:27,300
Speaker 1: No one will ever guess you're really ridiculously long password But you'll remember it without even needing any kind of encryption or any kind of help whatsoever.

341
00:23:28,341 --> 00:23:28,943
Speaker 1: And that's it.

342
00:23:29,023 --> 00:23:30,166
Speaker 1: pass phrases to the king.

343
00:23:30,207 --> 00:23:30,929
Speaker 1: fuck everything else.

344
00:23:31,571 --> 00:23:33,657
Speaker 0: and last but not least the Linux kernel 4 7 was released.

345
00:23:34,881 --> 00:23:38,560
Speaker 0: That's actual tech news according to scout and everyone's talk about all this non tech news.

346
00:23:39,122 --> 00:23:42,110
Speaker 1: It's only news if they did something in that release of significance.

347
00:23:42,532 --> 00:23:44,337
Speaker 0: All right, let's see what was increased.

348
00:23:44,397 --> 00:23:45,260
Speaker 1: What a great news.

349
00:23:46,181 --> 00:23:48,307
Speaker 1: Support for arbitrary number went up.

350
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:51,857
Speaker 0: support for radion rx 480 GPUs.

351
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:52,820
Speaker 1: You got one of those.

352
00:23:53,201 --> 00:23:54,144
Speaker 0: No, who cares?

353
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:55,027
Speaker 0: It's radio.

354
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:55,850
Speaker 0: It's AMD.

355
00:23:55,950 --> 00:23:57,234
Speaker 0: No one wants those.

356
00:23:57,415 --> 00:23:58,880
Speaker 0: Why do you send video guys?

357
00:23:59,961 --> 00:24:04,377
Speaker 0: Let's see load pin which makes modules load by the kernel or just in files.

358
00:24:04,458 --> 00:24:09,254
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever Generating virtual USB device controllers and USB IP.

359
00:24:09,274 --> 00:24:16,540
Speaker 0: All right Sync file fencing mechanisms used in Android mobile operating systems.

360
00:24:17,183 --> 00:24:27,100
Speaker 0: Berkeley packet filter programs can attach to trace four points schedule till frequency governor to the CPU freak dynamic frequency scaling subsystem.

361
00:24:28,183 --> 00:24:29,493
Speaker 0: None of this matters to 99% of humans.

362
00:24:31,364 --> 00:24:32,318
Speaker 1: Ninety nine point nine nine.

363
00:24:33,525 --> 00:24:34,338
Speaker 1: I'm presenting humans.

364
00:24:34,701 --> 00:24:38,355
Speaker 0: What's funny is the GPU stuff is interesting because that only matters.

365
00:24:38,375 --> 00:24:39,540
Speaker 1: any humans is a lot of humans.

366
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:48,852
Speaker 0: But the GPU and so like that only matters to people who are running Linux on the desktop and want a GPU To use this GPU stuff on the desktop.

367
00:24:48,872 --> 00:24:59,531
Speaker 1: could be someone somewhere who's using AMD to do like some CUDA processing project or something because they didn't buy in video maybe but I don't know if this driver Necessarily helps with that.

368
00:24:59,854 --> 00:25:00,459
Speaker 1: I don't know either.

369
00:25:01,512 --> 00:25:02,059
Speaker 1: No one cares.

370
00:25:03,003 --> 00:25:08,120
Speaker 1: The one person who has that video card and wants to run Linux on it is really excited.

371
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:12,120
Speaker 0: Are any of you the person wrote the driver actually you the listener?

372
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,579
Speaker 0: I have a question for you does anything in the Linux for seven kernel in any way?

373
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,525
Speaker 0: Affect you at all.

374
00:25:19,665 --> 00:25:21,691
Speaker 0: If it does I really want to hear from you.

375
00:25:21,952 --> 00:25:33,300
Speaker 1: It might matter to some Android people's, you know, eventually Yeah, maybe in a way they won't realize It's just most good uses of Linux these days are servers not so much desktops.

376
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,988
Speaker 1: Well, I mean Linux runs everything these days.

377
00:25:36,109 --> 00:25:38,376
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it's not running but it's not a desktop.

378
00:25:38,476 --> 00:25:39,480
Speaker 1: It pretty much runs Linux.

379
00:25:39,963 --> 00:25:51,229
Speaker 1: yeah, unless it's an iOS device and You know not just servers like literally every device that isn't a Windows desktop or an Apple devices or legacy device Which is like old Windows is running Linux.

380
00:25:51,249 --> 00:25:58,939
Speaker 1: So, you know the changes of the kernel that affect all those devices But they're invisible to all human beings Except the ones working on.

381
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:09,595
Speaker 0: but anyway things of the day All right, so I'm just gonna.

382
00:26:09,656 --> 00:26:12,006
Speaker 1: I couldn't actually have any things of the day cuz I've been.

383
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,329
Speaker 1: yeah There weren't really any good things of the day going on.

384
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:22,770
Speaker 1: so just do a self-indulgent thing of the day the kind of thing that usually I You'd like on YouTube and then don't make a thing of the day cuz I'm like, yeah That's just a thing that I like not a thing of the day.

385
00:26:22,871 --> 00:26:31,969
Speaker 1: But recently like a week ago or so Whereas the alternative press music awards a music award show even crappier than like the Grammys.

386
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:39,122
Speaker 1: yeah, somehow is that if there's even possible an award show where literally no one cares and Really you won one of these awards.

387
00:26:39,202 --> 00:26:40,008
Speaker 1: No one gives a shit.

388
00:26:40,652 --> 00:26:52,586
Speaker 1: But as award shows are like to do especially musical ones There are performances there and at this award show There is a performance of babymetal on stage with Rob Halford.

389
00:26:52,606 --> 00:26:55,429
Speaker 1: If you don't know who that is That's the Judas Priest guy.

390
00:26:56,252 --> 00:26:57,138
Speaker 1: It's breaking the law.

391
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,889
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they broke all the laws.

392
00:26:59,552 --> 00:27:02,442
Speaker 1: So watch this video and see all the laws be broken.

393
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:03,224
Speaker 1: Nice.

394
00:27:03,405 --> 00:27:13,070
Speaker 1: What's really freaky is You know like in babymetal There's three girls the one who can actually sing and the two that pretty much just dance and make cute noises, right?

395
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:18,410
Speaker 1: So the two cute noises ones didn't really have a lot to do on this kind of stage.

396
00:27:19,172 --> 00:27:25,250
Speaker 1: So they had them come out with these tiny guitars that were really even more cute.

397
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:34,687
Speaker 1: and The thing is if you watch the video It looks like they're maybe actually playing them possibly.

398
00:27:34,707 --> 00:27:36,364
Speaker 0: Oh That's interesting.

399
00:27:36,710 --> 00:27:44,983
Speaker 1: I mean, they're probably turned way down on the mixer board so they don't fuck anything up But it really looks like they're playing it.

400
00:27:45,043 --> 00:27:52,853
Speaker 1: You know, usually you can tell like yeah They're just pretending to play which is see the thing is everyone expected them to be pretending to play Video like.

401
00:27:52,873 --> 00:27:57,547
Speaker 1: it almost looks like they're playing and they're actually have little wires coming out going to wireless packs.

402
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,816
Speaker 0: good modern Videos of things like.

403
00:27:59,856 --> 00:28:02,870
Speaker 0: it's especially just a real band where people actually do play their instruments normally.

404
00:28:03,051 --> 00:28:11,182
Speaker 0: But this is live streamed on like Amazon live stream Yeah, so when they're doing a live show that can't be fucked up like, you know Like some bands will do a live show.

405
00:28:11,202 --> 00:28:12,069
Speaker 0: they do a real live show.

406
00:28:12,471 --> 00:28:18,838
Speaker 0: But if you're doing the live show at like the Olympics or something or the halftime They're not gonna risk like something bad happening.

407
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,490
Speaker 0: So usually they'll actually be playing the songs on the instruments.

408
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:25,490
Speaker 0: They're just not that and music isn't going anyway, right?

409
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:29,910
Speaker 1: But even if they were doing that the surprise is they know how to play.

410
00:28:30,553 --> 00:28:33,590
Speaker 0: I guess I kind of expected that from them because they seem very earnest.

411
00:28:33,831 --> 00:28:39,005
Speaker 1: I think it's a thing as you know, Japanese people always practicing too hard and putting in the extra effort.

412
00:28:39,266 --> 00:28:39,868
Speaker 0: It depends.

413
00:28:40,008 --> 00:28:48,410
Speaker 0: I've seen multiple J-pop idol Concerts where the person was literally doing the opposite of even pretending to play.

414
00:28:48,631 --> 00:28:51,283
Speaker 0: They're just like kind of banging their hand against the guitar.

415
00:28:51,464 --> 00:28:51,524
Speaker 1: Yes.

416
00:28:51,645 --> 00:28:55,238
Speaker 0: I have seen that as well I think when what's-her-name got her hair stuck in the guitar.

417
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,964
Speaker 1: Oh that whatever her name was.

418
00:28:56,984 --> 00:28:59,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, Otacon concert That was a long time ago.

419
00:28:59,974 --> 00:29:01,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember who that was.

420
00:29:01,719 --> 00:29:05,270
Speaker 0: So actually surprisingly semi-related my video.

421
00:29:05,551 --> 00:29:09,366
Speaker 1: So whoever made those tiny guitars that are too cute for life.

422
00:29:09,727 --> 00:29:12,013
Speaker 1: Yeah Props to you.

423
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:18,139
Speaker 0: So if you didn't know this it's actually impossible to tune a piano What?

424
00:29:18,885 --> 00:29:22,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, so No, you can hire people to tune your fucking.

425
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:23,219
Speaker 1: they can't.

426
00:29:23,319 --> 00:29:24,343
Speaker 0: they can't.

427
00:29:24,443 --> 00:29:28,787
Speaker 0: they can tune your piano and I'm making quote motions But they cannot tune it evenly.

428
00:29:29,894 --> 00:29:30,939
Speaker 0: If some notes are gonna be.

429
00:29:30,959 --> 00:29:33,030
Speaker 1: there's a bunch of individual strings.

430
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:35,199
Speaker 0: Yes, that's why it can't be tuned.

431
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,810
Speaker 1: each string makes one specific note.

432
00:29:38,392 --> 00:29:40,061
Speaker 0: That that is why the piano cannot be.

433
00:29:40,081 --> 00:29:41,709
Speaker 1: there is a separate string for every key.

434
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:44,961
Speaker 1: You say that you make every single string.

435
00:29:45,162 --> 00:29:47,510
Speaker 1: that is the correct string at the correct tension.

436
00:29:47,712 --> 00:29:48,844
Speaker 0: So what is the correct string?

437
00:29:48,884 --> 00:29:49,450
Speaker 0: intention Scott?

438
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,618
Speaker 1: Because the problem is you have a little tuner.

439
00:29:51,638 --> 00:29:54,630
Speaker 1: so say this key is this is you know?

440
00:29:54,750 --> 00:30:02,088
Speaker 1: this middle C and you press it and The same hammer hits the string and you say well was that at the frequency of middle C?

441
00:30:02,188 --> 00:30:03,755
Speaker 1: and you know It was a little bit low free.

442
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:05,502
Speaker 1: so Scott make it tighter.

443
00:30:05,884 --> 00:30:08,166
Speaker 1: so a little bit high frequency I'll make it looser.

444
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:10,197
Speaker 1: There you go exactly the right frequency.

445
00:30:10,217 --> 00:30:12,686
Speaker 1: when the hammer hit the string that string is in tune.

446
00:30:12,726 --> 00:30:13,830
Speaker 1: you do repeat for every string.

447
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:15,370
Speaker 0: That's why this video is important.

448
00:30:15,451 --> 00:30:19,679
Speaker 0: So Scott when you watch this video and it's only four minutes long You will find out that you are wrong.

449
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:21,910
Speaker 1: The strings are not related to each other in any way.

450
00:30:22,171 --> 00:30:24,500
Speaker 1: It is literally just happen to be next to each other.

451
00:30:24,841 --> 00:30:31,350
Speaker 0: with with music and the way music notes work It is impossible to evenly and perfectly tune a piano.

452
00:30:31,450 --> 00:30:32,475
Speaker 1: I think this is a bullshit.

453
00:30:32,515 --> 00:30:33,097
Speaker 1: hooks video.

454
00:30:33,961 --> 00:30:35,206
Speaker 0: uh you do I do okay?

455
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:39,218
Speaker 1: Incorrect and against all common sense.

456
00:30:39,699 --> 00:30:42,490
Speaker 0: so when you're you could google around for an evenly.

457
00:30:42,933 --> 00:30:45,170
Speaker 1: It should then be also impossible to tune a guitar.

458
00:30:45,190 --> 00:30:46,776
Speaker 1: It's just a piano with a lot less strings.

459
00:30:47,137 --> 00:30:49,607
Speaker 0: uh no guitars can be perfectly tuned then why can't not?

460
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:50,655
Speaker 1: a piano is the same thing.

461
00:30:51,063 --> 00:30:55,537
Speaker 0: you You should Watch this video.

462
00:30:55,557 --> 00:30:56,060
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

463
00:30:56,241 --> 00:30:57,750
Speaker 1: I have a feeling this video is gonna be full bullshit.

464
00:30:58,132 --> 00:31:07,349
Speaker 0: So there are different ways to tune a piano and basically no matter what the method I just said is the correct method every method will have some keys will be out of tune.

465
00:31:08,811 --> 00:31:15,717
Speaker 0: Sounds to me like you're now the way around that get a new tuning fork in the old days if you want a piano That is perfectly evenly tuned.

466
00:31:16,039 --> 00:31:22,592
Speaker 0: that piano is only set up to play in basically one key Mm-hmm.

467
00:31:22,853 --> 00:31:24,741
Speaker 0: yeah like uh you know what Scott.

468
00:31:24,761 --> 00:31:26,730
Speaker 0: watch the video mm-hmm, okay?

469
00:31:27,450 --> 00:31:29,015
Speaker 0: I've studied music theory.

470
00:31:29,035 --> 00:31:30,561
Speaker 0: I was a musician.

471
00:31:30,581 --> 00:31:33,350
Speaker 0: I'm not a musician anymore, so I don't play my trumpet for shit.

472
00:31:34,231 --> 00:31:35,054
Speaker 0: You've watched this video.

473
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:36,038
Speaker 0: You cannot tune a piano.

474
00:31:36,078 --> 00:31:36,681
Speaker 0: You're wrong.

475
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:37,866
Speaker 1: the sound sounds wrong.

476
00:31:37,926 --> 00:31:39,171
Speaker 0: I'll bet you $100.

477
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:41,884
Speaker 0: This video is not wrong not better than anything.

478
00:31:41,904 --> 00:31:43,150
Speaker 1: cuz what do I know about music?

479
00:31:44,672 --> 00:31:53,980
Speaker 1: But I suspect many of you out there It's just common sense that you can make a string sound a particular frequency when it's hit with a hammer For and you can do that for one string.

480
00:31:54,000 --> 00:32:00,210
Speaker 1: you can do it for as many strings as you need even if you had three Pianos, so I suspect that the listenership view the listener.

481
00:32:00,391 --> 00:32:02,899
Speaker 0: I guess our skits are obviously alities.

482
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:04,825
Speaker 1: does that not make sense though.

483
00:32:05,186 --> 00:32:06,190
Speaker 0: It does make sense.

484
00:32:07,494 --> 00:32:08,418
Speaker 0: So that's the problem.

485
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:16,309
Speaker 0: all the listener out there who are Musicians are go are laughing at you and all the people who are not musicians are laughing at me.

486
00:32:17,076 --> 00:32:18,550
Speaker 0: And it is very counterintuitive.

487
00:32:19,031 --> 00:32:23,603
Speaker 0: But this is why when you get a piano tune one string and can tune a thousand strings.

488
00:32:23,724 --> 00:32:29,510
Speaker 0: an expert piano tuner if you care We'll ask you how you want the piano tempered.

489
00:32:30,454 --> 00:32:32,583
Speaker 0: What temperament do you want to give the piano?

490
00:32:32,644 --> 00:32:33,970
Speaker 1: I want every string to sound?

491
00:32:34,670 --> 00:32:36,898
Speaker 1: Exactly the frequency that it is supposed to.

492
00:32:37,299 --> 00:32:38,724
Speaker 0: watch this video, and we'll.

493
00:32:38,744 --> 00:32:40,370
Speaker 0: we'll talk about it again on Wednesday.

494
00:32:42,272 --> 00:32:51,277
Speaker 0: In the moment we are going to be live at PAX West We're doing one panel.

495
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:54,769
Speaker 0: I forgot when it is so I got to pull up some Saturday our website.

496
00:32:54,789 --> 00:32:57,909
Speaker 0: I think Saturday afternoon or evening or something like that.

497
00:32:59,651 --> 00:33:01,497
Speaker 0: Five ish row crew calm.

498
00:33:01,818 --> 00:33:05,730
Speaker 0: Saturday, September 3rd 5 p.m.. I remember chicken theater the grind.

499
00:33:06,454 --> 00:33:09,110
Speaker 1: So you know at PAX East when you want to go to a theater?

500
00:33:10,091 --> 00:33:12,419
Speaker 1: You just think oh, that's the albatross theater.

501
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:19,268
Speaker 1: it must be at the top because it's a flying animal yep and it's a. so it must be in the corner because it goes ABCD.

502
00:33:19,288 --> 00:33:28,879
Speaker 1: if you are at PAX West and You hear the name of a theater such as the chicken theater How do you know where it is?

503
00:33:28,899 --> 00:33:31,370
Speaker 0: isn't the first letter the name of the hotel?

504
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:32,614
Speaker 1: It's in the first.

505
00:33:32,675 --> 00:33:33,297
Speaker 1: that is correct.

506
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:36,490
Speaker 1: the first letter of the theater means we're in the Convention Center.

507
00:33:36,913 --> 00:33:39,430
Speaker 0: That is correct as opposed to before we were in the hotel.

508
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,294
Speaker 0: That's actually pretty.

509
00:33:40,314 --> 00:33:47,509
Speaker 1: panels that are in the Hyatt begin with H And the ones that are in the Sheraton begin with s and such and such.

510
00:33:48,252 --> 00:33:48,813
Speaker 1: That's how works.

511
00:33:49,034 --> 00:33:54,871
Speaker 0: that is why packs is one of the best-run conventions on earth because they put the thought into making that sort of System.

512
00:33:55,393 --> 00:34:03,989
Speaker 0: it does not hurt people who are too dumb to understand it or who are ignorant of it regardless of their intelligence But it helps people who have the gnosis also.

513
00:34:04,531 --> 00:34:08,225
Speaker 1: We're a guess we're getting free badges to packs yet again meaning we have two badges.

514
00:34:08,284 --> 00:34:08,786
Speaker 1: I have well.

515
00:34:08,806 --> 00:34:15,527
Speaker 1: I have eight badges Friday Saturday Sunday Monday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday, and I got to do something with those.

516
00:34:15,888 --> 00:34:16,710
Speaker 1: we'll figure that out.

517
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:20,186
Speaker 1: I probably should get money in exchange to them because I could use some money.

518
00:34:20,206 --> 00:34:22,511
Speaker 0: Yeah, well We'll sell them at least at face value We're not.

519
00:34:22,551 --> 00:34:26,409
Speaker 1: well you could buy them from me with if you want to do something with them that is free.

520
00:34:27,053 --> 00:34:28,984
Speaker 1: You could buy them from me with patreon money.

521
00:34:29,004 --> 00:34:32,074
Speaker 0: Oh Oh, yeah Maybe we should.

522
00:34:32,094 --> 00:34:34,202
Speaker 0: maybe I should buy them from you with patreon money and give them away.

523
00:34:34,282 --> 00:34:34,945
Speaker 1: There's a markup.

524
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:37,637
Speaker 0: no markup No mark up.

525
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:42,337
Speaker 1: It's maybe like 50% mark up, dude We're some more 500% mark.

526
00:34:42,357 --> 00:34:46,489
Speaker 0: we are among the blessed few who don't have to worry about getting tags badges.

527
00:34:46,571 --> 00:34:48,789
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna scalp the badges we got.

528
00:34:49,690 --> 00:34:50,958
Speaker 1: I'm the one scalping them to you.

529
00:34:51,018 --> 00:34:51,944
Speaker 0: Yes, you bought them.

530
00:34:52,165 --> 00:34:53,090
Speaker 0: I I failed.

531
00:34:53,231 --> 00:34:57,910
Speaker 0: I tried to buy packs badges because you know I'm always worried too, and I didn't get in in time.

532
00:34:58,352 --> 00:35:02,249
Speaker 0: That's not my fault your bad internet, so I only have a badge because we're a guest again.

533
00:35:02,972 --> 00:35:04,700
Speaker 1: Well, you would have had one of these ones if we.

Speaker 0: Basically, I'm gonna talk about the scene transitions in utenna with a bunch of specific examples And I'm gonna take all the scenes from episode 15 and show all the sort of Kubrick style Nonsense that you see in utenna where like in one scene someone's holding something and then in the next scene There's something sitting in the spot where the person was holding it and that's very much on purpose.

556
00:36:44,872 --> 00:36:45,963
Speaker 0: Whatever, it's good stuff.

557
00:36:47,517 --> 00:36:51,795

Speaker 0: Yeah, it's got two little guys with chef hats.

563
00:37:09,403 --> 00:37:10,629
Speaker 1: I got to represent my full web.

564
00:37:11,252 --> 00:37:18,637
Speaker 0: Actually ice cream sheep scream is good because you know that bright blue Threadless shirt with the lockdowns monster.

565
00:37:18,657 --> 00:37:19,560
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

566

Speaker 0: Anyway, stay tuned on all that.

568
00:37:27,048 --> 00:37:27,450
Speaker 0: It'll be fun.

569
00:37:28,273 --> 00:37:30,923
Speaker 0: So this issue comes up a lot in tech circles.

570
00:37:30,963 --> 00:37:36,990
Speaker 0: like normal tech people know about this a lot But it's interesting to be aware of the fact that this is a much bigger problem.

571
00:37:37,414 --> 00:37:48,020
Speaker 0: Like tech people say they care about this But the average tech person would not actually take advantage of the right to repair things that they fight for Even though ideologically know they're the right thing.

572
00:37:48,281 --> 00:37:49,024
Speaker 1: It's principle.

573
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,210
Speaker 1: Yeah principle the thing.

574
00:37:50,671 --> 00:37:52,838
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna link to one because it's the most.

575
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,372
Speaker 0: it's the most recent one of the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of articles You can find.

576
00:37:57,392 --> 00:38:02,490
Speaker 0: that will show you the people who are actually really hurt by this problem.

577
00:38:02,631 --> 00:38:04,970
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm and farmers are a really good example.

578
00:38:05,372 --> 00:38:08,770
Speaker 0: So if you own a tractor, right you might think a tractor is a simple dumb thing.

579
00:38:08,810 --> 00:38:12,987
Speaker 1: But actually it's a motor and some wheels and maybe another motor to spin something.

580
00:38:13,067 --> 00:38:21,290
Speaker 0: and you know Yep, but tractors have very complex gearing because of the kind of stuff they have to do and oftentimes Yeah, it's you know, it's a specifically powerful high torque engine, right?

581
00:38:21,410 --> 00:38:31,430
Speaker 1: It doesn't move real fast, but it can pull a lot of shit real, you know Heavy and but they also usually integrate with very complex mechanisms that they tow.

582
00:38:31,992 --> 00:38:35,309
Speaker 0: The tractor itself you think of a tractor is like it's pulling something around.

583
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:39,305
Speaker 0: Yeah It's pulling around a giant death robot thresher or something, right?

584
00:38:39,365 --> 00:38:45,861
Speaker 1: Not only is it pulling it It's also spinning things in that you know It's like sort of like my stand mixer right at the front.

585
00:38:45,901 --> 00:38:53,662
Speaker 1: It has that attachment or it's like it's not just mixing It's also got this thing on the front that's turning that you can Attach an ice cream maker a meat grinder to and shit.

586
00:38:53,742 --> 00:38:55,790
Speaker 1: now also tractors like that times a million.

587
00:38:56,071 --> 00:39:07,030
Speaker 0: So unlike a consumer vehicle where there's lots and lots of customers and lots and lots of companies making them Which is what most people talk about when they talk about retro repair Not that many companies make for real tractors.

588
00:39:07,913 --> 00:39:09,369
Speaker 0: That's a specialized thing.

589
00:39:09,611 --> 00:39:14,550
Speaker 1: There's only a few companies in the world that make tractors like John Deere and maybe like caterpillar?

590
00:39:14,651 --> 00:39:16,089
Speaker 1: Do they then they make other kinds of?

591
00:39:17,191 --> 00:39:19,170
Speaker 0: Can't make similar, you know construction devices.

592
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:27,389
Speaker 1: You know specialized equipment like that is only made by a few companies and because you know Even if there are more companies is only a few that make good ones.

593
00:39:27,631 --> 00:39:33,910
Speaker 0: so like you say you wanted to buy a car and you Learned that from mechanics that that car was real expensive to maintain because mechanics couldn't fix it.

594
00:39:34,412 --> 00:39:36,823
Speaker 0: You might decide to buy a car that didn't have that problem.

595
00:39:37,144 --> 00:39:38,410
Speaker 0: Let's buy this Volkswagen.

596
00:39:38,672 --> 00:39:40,770
Speaker 1: Why is there a huge line to the service department behind?

597
00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,816
Speaker 1: Let's not buy one of these.

598
00:39:42,836 --> 00:39:45,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's buy this kinda and I'll just mess with it myself.

599
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:54,033
Speaker 0: But if you buy a John Deere tractor like this article is very detailed if you buy the John Deere 8235 are Mm-hmm.

600
00:39:54,234 --> 00:39:57,610
Speaker 0: You can't fucking fix anything on it if something goes wrong.

601
00:39:57,670 --> 00:40:02,139
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a motor though shouldn't you just open it up look at the motor and if you know how motor works be able to fix it?

602
00:40:03,232 --> 00:40:04,096
Speaker 0: What do you like what this could?

603
00:40:04,116 --> 00:40:10,745
Speaker 0: so this this article is about a farmer who's fighting for the right to repair his own tractor So it has codes that'll pop up telling you.

604
00:40:10,765 --> 00:40:11,488
Speaker 0: Hey, there's a problem.

605
00:40:12,630 --> 00:40:16,970
Speaker 0: Legally you're not even allowed to look up what that code means because that would violate the DMCA.

606
00:40:18,432 --> 00:40:25,081
Speaker 0: The codes themselves are covered by the DMCA and under copyright You're not allowed to do things like like that.

607
00:40:25,121 --> 00:40:27,028
Speaker 0: the code might mean change a filter.

608
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:35,209
Speaker 0: now You're probably not even allowed to change the filter Even if you know what the code means because if you do you might void the service contract with John Deere.

609
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:39,949
Speaker 1: What if you buy one without a service contract, uh, then you probably can't repair it.

610
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:41,656
Speaker 0: Like.

611
00:40:41,696 --> 00:40:42,910
Speaker 0: the tractors are expensive.

612
00:40:42,990 --> 00:40:48,170
Speaker 0: They have very complicated sensors and they're basically there's a computer in there like all cars have computers in them.

613
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:57,146
Speaker 0: now tractors have way more complicated computers and There aren't nearly as many people who are hacking those computers like there are with the car mod community.

614
00:40:57,648 --> 00:40:59,373
Speaker 1: and even then yeah It's not like computer.

615
00:40:59,393 --> 00:41:05,172
Speaker 0: people are buying tractors and say you're a farmer and you buy a super expensive tractor upon which your livelihood Depends.

616
00:41:05,574 --> 00:41:14,129
Speaker 0: you're not gonna start hacking it because if you break it not only might you get sued by John Deere But they might just say well, we're not selling any more tractors and then what buy one for someone else?

617
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:15,113
Speaker 0: Who?

618
00:41:15,153 --> 00:41:20,234
Speaker 0: there's only so many people who make tractors and they all seem to have this problem and you already lost all your money buying That first one.

619
00:41:20,636 --> 00:41:24,757
Speaker 0: So John Deere very publicly is Against the right to repair.

620
00:41:24,777 --> 00:41:27,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, they want you to pay them every time something breaks.

621
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:45,469
Speaker 0: John Deere apparently officially said on record in an interview with Wired that giving giving farmers access to the software would quote Make it possible for pirates third-party developers and less innovative competitors to free ride off the creativity unique expression and ingenuity of vehicle software.

622
00:41:47,012 --> 00:41:48,336
Speaker 0: And they're using the DMCA.

623
00:41:48,356 --> 00:41:52,932
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell that's the primary tool they're using to f over the farmers Mm-hmm.

624
00:41:53,795 --> 00:42:10,190
Speaker 0: So this is an issue that I don't know how we're gonna win anything because as you pointed out and I'd forgotten about there was a right to repair bill in New York and The tech companies particularly Apple made sure it didn't pass Mm-hmm, so we have no right to repair our devices, right?

625
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,860
Speaker 1: Cuz the same thing applies right it would it would you know, make it.

626
00:42:13,241 --> 00:42:15,610
Speaker 1: anyone could just open up an old Apple repair business.

627
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:19,295
Speaker 0: Yeah, which I feel like that should be the case I got there is there are.

628
00:42:19,315 --> 00:42:22,890
Speaker 1: they exist but they would be even better if you know, there weren't these legal restrictions.

629
00:42:22,971 --> 00:42:29,030
Speaker 0: So I guess is there any argument we can make against Repealing this part of the DMCA and letting people repair their own devices?

630
00:42:29,431 --> 00:42:32,341
Speaker 1: You mean an argument like in John Deere's favor?

631
00:42:32,361 --> 00:42:32,823
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

632
00:42:32,863 --> 00:42:34,549
Speaker 0: is there any argument in Apple's favor?

633
00:42:34,609 --> 00:42:35,452
Speaker 0: or yeah There's favor.

634
00:42:35,493 --> 00:42:37,381
Speaker 1: those companies make more money this way.

635
00:42:37,401 --> 00:42:39,610
Speaker 0: Are is there any non evil argument?

636
00:42:40,211 --> 00:42:45,529
Speaker 1: No, if you buy something isn't the old saying, you know, if you can't fix it, you don't own it, right?

637
00:42:45,609 --> 00:42:52,089
Speaker 1: So It's people wanting are using the DMCA to basically collect rents.

638
00:42:53,574 --> 00:42:54,629
Speaker 1: That's all there is to it.

639
00:42:54,991 --> 00:43:11,630
Speaker 0: Now that that the if you don't if you can't repair you don't own it is a little bit troublesome though in the sense that We're entering a world where there's so much technology that it's basically expected that 99% of all humans will not be able to repair 99% of the things that they own even if there is zero legal restriction.

640
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,630
Speaker 1: I mean even if you go back to the 80s or when I bought a stereo it came with a complete schematic.

641
00:43:16,273 --> 00:43:18,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, did you ever solder your stereo to fix it?

642
00:43:18,464 --> 00:43:19,550
Speaker 1: I never even opened it, right?

643
00:43:20,212 --> 00:43:25,595
Speaker 0: When my cereal broke I did not use the schematic to fix it when we had a compressor for gig nights and one day it Stopped working.

644
00:43:25,616 --> 00:43:32,465
Speaker 0: I had the full schematic I had the full documentation of how it worked and everything and I did not try to repair it.

645
00:43:32,826 --> 00:43:34,210
Speaker 0: I threw it away, right?

646
00:43:34,370 --> 00:43:35,990
Speaker 1: So that's the step number one.

647
00:43:36,071 --> 00:43:42,230
Speaker 1: If you can't repair it You don't own it is even if you're allowed to repair it and you have the information as needed to repair it.

648
00:43:42,771 --> 00:43:54,130
Speaker 1: you need to have these skills and knowledge to actually execute that repair and you know, the Willingness to try to do the repair with a risk of failure, right?

649
00:43:54,650 --> 00:44:02,143
Speaker 1: So, you know if you don't have those things if you don't know how to you know work with an engine You could get a car and like a full blueprint to the car.

650
00:44:02,163 --> 00:44:06,601
Speaker 1: and if you don't know how to do anything You don't have to use a wrench or understand how an engine works.

651
00:44:07,204 --> 00:44:08,750
Speaker 1: You don't really own that car.

652
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:12,366
Speaker 1: You really you know the mechanic who lives near you has you.

653
00:44:12,446 --> 00:44:13,149
Speaker 1: oh, they own you.

654
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:18,350
Speaker 1: They own that car really and you have to pay them for the ability to use your car if it ever breaks.

655
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:22,422
Speaker 0: But at least in that got you over a barrel you can go to any mechanic.

656
00:44:22,944 --> 00:44:24,770
Speaker 1: Yes, you can go to any mechanic.

657
00:44:25,111 --> 00:44:27,197
Speaker 0: There's a wider net so more there's.

658
00:44:27,378 --> 00:44:31,130
Speaker 1: it is better, but you're still being owned and you're not the owner.

659
00:44:31,431 --> 00:44:36,333
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that distinction is increasing in principle, but in practicality It's increasingly meaningless.

660
00:44:36,574 --> 00:44:39,943
Speaker 0: because the reality is you can't even expect people to have that capability.

661
00:44:40,324 --> 00:44:41,588
Speaker 0: and also there's a side argument.

662
00:44:41,608 --> 00:44:46,507
Speaker 1: What if You even own yourself if you don't know how to doctor yourself, right?

663
00:44:46,889 --> 00:44:50,546
Speaker 0: Yeah On your own body, I'm gonna defer to other people.

664
00:44:50,566 --> 00:44:50,968
Speaker 0: I'm not dr.

665
00:44:51,048 --> 00:44:52,254
Speaker 0: McNinja I'm not gonna so much.

666
00:44:52,455 --> 00:44:54,484
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna undislocate my own jaw.

667
00:44:54,504 --> 00:44:55,890
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna relocate my job.

668
00:44:58,474 --> 00:44:59,050
Speaker 1: Doctor own it.

669
00:44:59,890 --> 00:45:00,953
Speaker 0: Doctor owns my jaw.

670
00:45:00,993 --> 00:45:03,199
Speaker 0: Yeah doctor owns most things about my body.

671
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:06,106
Speaker 0: I mostly own my allergies my nose stuff.

672
00:45:06,126 --> 00:45:06,788
Speaker 0: I know about that.

673
00:45:06,808 --> 00:45:09,193
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm But what?

674
00:45:09,213 --> 00:45:13,130
Speaker 0: so let's say we didn't have any of these laws and you were free to fix anything.

675
00:45:14,112 --> 00:45:25,584
Speaker 0: At what point is a company like Apple like within their moral rights to say because you tried to fix this But you're stupid We're not going to value when we're gonna avoid the warranty.

676
00:45:25,624 --> 00:45:26,106
Speaker 1: That's fine.

677
00:45:26,428 --> 00:45:31,047
Speaker 0: That's fine Yeah, so what if Apple said if you ever try to repair it, we're gonna void your warranty.

678
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:31,690
Speaker 1: That's fine.

679
00:45:32,412 --> 00:45:39,514
Speaker 0: So that means that even if there was no DMCA you would still not actually have the practical Read space writer.

680
00:45:39,554 --> 00:45:42,783
Speaker 1: Well, no because if something is currently under warranty, right?

681
00:45:43,064 --> 00:45:45,571
Speaker 1: So Apple sells you iPhone a month later It breaks.

682
00:45:46,233 --> 00:45:53,234
Speaker 1: you could repair it yourself because with this we're assuming we have the right to repair and we have the schematics We know how to fix it.

683
00:45:53,676 --> 00:45:56,628
Speaker 1: We got you know, Apple's providing service manuals and shit, right?

684
00:45:57,472 --> 00:46:04,366
Speaker 1: But if it's under warranty There's no reason for you to do that because you're gonna get a free fucking repair or replacement.

685
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:08,863
Speaker 0: All right, wait, so is Apple Obligated in this case to provide the service manuals.

686
00:46:10,090 --> 00:46:12,970
Speaker 1: I Mean if you have the right to repair and in though.

687
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:16,530
Speaker 0: Well, no, do you have the positive right to repair or the negative right to repair?

688
00:46:16,610 --> 00:46:18,990
Speaker 0: Do you have the right to repair if you don't have the service manual?

689
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:24,730
Speaker 1: You don't have there even if you have the right to fix it, but no, there's a you don't really have the ability.

690
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:27,769
Speaker 1: See, it doesn't it's meaningless, but there is a huge no different.

691
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:37,457
Speaker 0: There is a huge difference between saying you're not allowed to repair it and saying any company that makes something is forced to make Manual a service manual.

692
00:46:37,517 --> 00:46:44,030
Speaker 1: It's different but in in terms of like yes, that's going a bit further But really if you don't make the people give you the service manual.

693
00:46:44,833 --> 00:46:48,890
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter if you give people the right to repair they can't repair it because they don't have the fucking service manual.

694
00:46:48,990 --> 00:46:55,410
Speaker 0: So but it does create a market for third-party people who will reverse engineer the service manual which we've seen happen with consumer vehicles.

695
00:46:55,551 --> 00:47:00,850
Speaker 1: They can't but they can't get it exactly right and you're always gonna be left like is that repair place?

696
00:47:01,030 --> 00:47:04,430
Speaker 1: Like got it 100% right because they only have a reverse engineered idea.

697
00:47:04,831 --> 00:47:10,010
Speaker 1: They don't know exactly right and that original place who made the thing still has that.

698
00:47:10,592 --> 00:47:11,254
Speaker 0: What's the line?

699
00:47:11,294 --> 00:47:12,338
Speaker 0: So say I make a video game?

700
00:47:12,639 --> 00:47:13,763
Speaker 0: What's the service manual?

701
00:47:13,803 --> 00:47:19,902
Speaker 1: I'm now obligated to provide to my customers I mean a video game isn't really something that gets repaired what there's a bug.

702
00:47:20,384 --> 00:47:22,150
Speaker 0: keep tribes who doesn't work on my video card.

703
00:47:25,111 --> 00:47:30,695
Speaker 0: Do they have to give me the source code which is the service manual if it has comments in it and then I can repair It myself.

704
00:47:31,038 --> 00:47:31,744
Speaker 0: What's the line?

705
00:47:31,785 --> 00:47:32,350
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying?

706
00:47:32,551 --> 00:47:40,883
Speaker 0: That's why I'm shying far from a positive right to repair because that opens a can of worms that I don't think Humanity is capable of sorting yet.

707
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,534
Speaker 1: Oh I could.

708
00:47:42,654 --> 00:47:43,559
Speaker 1: I'm fine with that.

709
00:47:43,579 --> 00:47:48,285
Speaker 0: Well, I would I guess if we're gonna go with positive rights I'd rather go with like some positive rights.

710
00:47:48,467 --> 00:47:53,664
Speaker 1: I think you can Think you get into a situation where it's like, okay, you made a video game, right?

711
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:54,928
Speaker 1: You're delivering it.

712
00:47:55,008 --> 00:47:55,570
Speaker 1: There's a bug.

713
00:47:56,294 --> 00:47:57,420
Speaker 1: Are you gonna patch that bug?

714
00:47:57,440 --> 00:47:59,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, you got some kind of warranty, right?

715
00:47:59,191 --> 00:48:00,938
Speaker 1: You know, are you gonna give the person a refund?

716
00:48:00,959 --> 00:48:01,601
Speaker 1: or what are you gonna do?

717
00:48:02,305 --> 00:48:03,430
Speaker 1: and if they don't patch it?

718
00:48:03,870 --> 00:48:05,389
Speaker 1: That means they're not maintaining it anymore.

719
00:48:06,291 --> 00:48:14,665
Speaker 1: You could go to if you could go to court and force them to give you the source code Because you have the right to repair and they're refusing to repair it and give you a because

720
00:48:14,685 --> 00:48:24,706
Speaker 0: that would edge a little bit Into the orphan work stuff with copyright where if no one's using this thing or no one can identify who owns it Maybe there should be a way for someone to reclaim it the same way you can reclaim.

721
00:48:24,766 --> 00:48:27,474
Speaker 1: It's all the same issue Yeah, but we're just incapable.

722
00:48:27,515 --> 00:48:29,459
Speaker 0: society is dealing with that issue whatever.

723
00:48:30,101 --> 00:48:46,122
Speaker 0: but I guess if we're gonna if we're gonna focus on practical Realities the practical reality of consumer vehicles is that even though it's technically illegal in a lot of places to reverse engineer this People are doing it and it's almost working itself out.

724
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:53,840
Speaker 1: I mean, I just saw a YouTube video of There's those people who found the Super PlayStation in their attic or whatever.

725
00:48:54,121 --> 00:49:07,643
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, and they brought it to Ben Hector whatever his name is that guy and He totally like got the CD-ROM working again and shit just by figuring it out because he knows so much about Electronics and he had a super didn't edit SNES schematic and the things.

726
00:49:07,724 --> 00:49:09,430
Speaker 1: mostly is Super Nintendo with the CD-ROM.

727
00:49:09,570 --> 00:49:14,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he was able to you know, like replace some bad capacitors and you know get stuff going.

728
00:49:14,271 --> 00:49:18,370
Speaker 1: So it's like you can get really far even without any manuals whatsoever.

729
00:49:18,430 --> 00:49:20,318
Speaker 0: So, I guess actually.

730
00:49:20,338 --> 00:49:23,090
Speaker 0: so the one final piece what if you make a dip like Apple?

731
00:49:23,334 --> 00:49:30,937
Speaker 0: This is where I would defend them If you make a device like people used to complain about how you can't swap the batteries out of certain devices Because they're built-in embedded.

732
00:49:31,399 --> 00:49:38,422
Speaker 0: There are situations where making something less Modular or less repairable could make its form factor better.

733
00:49:38,463 --> 00:49:39,927
Speaker 0: Like look at most good laptops.

734
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:45,910
Speaker 0: I Defy you to do significant repairs on them because they're so embedded and tightly coupled.

735
00:49:46,292 --> 00:49:48,582
Speaker 0: The tight coupling is what made it a good thing.

736
00:49:48,602 --> 00:50:02,429
Speaker 1: I'm not saying you have to make your device Physically easy to repair at that to sacrifice the quality of the device I'm just saying yep You have to provide the in you should you know in an ideal world have to provide the full schematic of this device.

737
00:50:03,191 --> 00:50:11,527
Speaker 1: It's that someone with the not appropriate knowledge and tools could repair it without having to pay the original manufacturer After the warranty is done.

738
00:50:12,414 --> 00:50:31,322
Speaker 0: Thus I propose if nothing else Instead of like cell phones and cars and the things that the right-to-repair Activists usually fight about because those things are pretty abstract to the average person and the issues get pretty complex we should probably focus on the Specific harms to society that matter like farms and tractors.

739
00:50:31,423 --> 00:50:43,760
Speaker 0: I feel like narrow legislation in specific industries like this with captive audiences with rights to repair in those circumstances would break the seal and Normal non techies can understand.

740
00:50:43,780 --> 00:50:44,643
Speaker 0: Well, what do you mean?

741
00:50:44,664 --> 00:50:46,130
Speaker 0: the farmer can't fix his fucking tractor?

742
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:47,054
Speaker 0: What's that bullshit?

743
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:49,970
Speaker 0: because that same person cares a lot less about your smartphone?

744
00:50:50,870 --> 00:50:51,897
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

745
00:50:51,918 --> 00:50:53,227
Speaker 1: I think people understand that.

746
00:50:53,308 --> 00:51:05,090
Speaker 1: you know They're upset when their phone breaks and they're upset when they go to the Apple Store and Apple won't help them and then they go To a place that charges a fortune Whereas if this law had passed you could have gone to a place and gotten charged way less than a fortune.

747
00:51:05,150 --> 00:51:13,432
Speaker 0: Yep, when the Apple geniuses didn't want to help you I also do think that law should have passed because skimming what it actually did it was babies first Like.

748
00:51:13,492 --> 00:51:14,697
Speaker 0: it didn't do a lot.

749
00:51:14,837 --> 00:51:16,383
Speaker 1: No, it didn't go nearly far enough.

750
00:51:16,584 --> 00:51:18,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it didn't pass either.

751
00:51:18,733 --> 00:51:19,578
Speaker 0: So it's just something to think about.

752
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,910
Speaker 1: it was New York only it wasn't even like the whole country.

753
00:51:22,392 --> 00:51:27,470
Speaker 0: But when you've got when you're a techie who's got a very like I have a lot of real angry opinions about copyright.

754
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:30,846
Speaker 0: The average person doesn't understand those things.

755
00:51:30,866 --> 00:51:42,650
Speaker 0: You've got to pick specific concrete Understandable examples and advocate for specific Focused practical solutions to those and when enough of those accrete you can then make the general case.

756
00:51:43,072 --> 00:51:47,470
Speaker 0: I think that works a lot better than vaguely agitating for complex things that people don't understand.

757
00:51:48,672 --> 00:51:50,238
Speaker 1: I mean, I only care about repairing shit.

758
00:51:50,258 --> 00:51:53,210
Speaker 1: I don't care about the optimal way to make a law pass.

759
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:55,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, but that's so.

760
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:56,405
Speaker 0: that's so you voted for Bernie.

761
00:51:56,425 --> 00:51:57,269
Speaker 0: I guess I voted for Hillary.

762
00:51:58,752 --> 00:51:59,696
Speaker 1: Yet, it's not November.

763
00:51:59,716 --> 00:52:00,659
Speaker 0: would you vote for in the primary?

764
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:01,242
Speaker 1: I didn't.

765
00:52:01,503 --> 00:52:02,667
Speaker 0: you really didn't vote in the primary.

766
00:52:02,687 --> 00:52:03,290
Speaker 1: not allowed to.

767
00:52:03,892 --> 00:52:04,674
Speaker 0: You're not a Democrat.

768
00:52:04,875 --> 00:52:05,076
Speaker 0: Nope.

769
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:09,369
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm a nothing and you can't change because you know change.

770
00:52:09,389 --> 00:52:15,510
Speaker 0: I Changed way back because I was real pissed that I couldn't vote for Zephyr teach-out because primaries in New York.

771
00:52:15,550 --> 00:52:17,416
Speaker 0: It's literally the only thing that matters in New York.

772
00:52:17,777 --> 00:52:21,108
Speaker 0: So I changed back then to be able to start voting now.

773
00:52:21,489 --> 00:52:23,518
Speaker 0: Hmm That's a separate issue.

774
