1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:12,552
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, February 29th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:13,014
Speaker 0: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:13,234 --> 00:00:13,776
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:14,960
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,660
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about Sailor Moon, the Super S movie.

6
00:00:21,661 --> 00:00:22,678
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,918
Speaker 0: As opposed to, you know, the Super S show or all the other, anyway.

8
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:32,231
Speaker 1: R, S, Q, P.

9
00:00:32,715 --> 00:00:33,198
Speaker 0: There's no Q.

10
00:00:34,022 --> 00:00:34,819
Speaker 1: Are you sure?

11
00:00:36,705 --> 00:00:38,020
Speaker 0: So we got some friends coming out this weekend.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:42,896
Speaker 0: It's basically, there may or may not be much Geek Nights next week, because I'm flying to India for a week.

13
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:44,686
Speaker 0: Leaving like Saturday.

14
00:00:44,848 --> 00:00:46,500
Speaker 0: And we got some friends coming out right before that.

15
00:00:47,022 --> 00:00:48,399
Speaker 1: Give the great tiger my regards.

16
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:52,480
Speaker 0: They're coming, of all things, for a yoga tournament.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,360
Speaker 0: And I realize that I cannot conceive...

18
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,129
Speaker 1: Wait, a yoga tournament?

19
00:00:57,209 --> 00:00:59,039
Speaker 1: As in yoga, fire, yoga, flame.

20
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,218
Speaker 0: I'm assuming that this is basically a street fight, because I cannot conceive of any other sort of yoga competition.

21
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,260
Speaker 1: I know yoga, and I can respect some kinds of yoga that aren't full of magical bullshit, you know.

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,980
Speaker 1: But it's like, how do you compete at that?

23
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,820
Speaker 1: Is it like, who can stay in the hot room the longest without passing out?

24
00:01:16,281 --> 00:01:17,980
Speaker 1: Is it who can do the hardest position?

25
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:18,733
Speaker 1: It can do...

26
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,460
Speaker 0: I think it's who can beat the other guy to death with yoga catastrophes first.

27
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:25,280
Speaker 1: Is it like, who does the positions better?

28
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,240
Speaker 1: You know, is it like with a little score rating system, like figure skating?

29
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:29,648
Speaker 1: Like, oh, 9.8, 9.7, you know?

30
00:01:31,621 --> 00:01:33,959
Speaker 1: Is it... Like, how does that freaking work?

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,420
Speaker 1: Is it like horse, where it's like, I do a yoga, then you have to do it?

32
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:39,550
Speaker 1: That'd be a good tournament.

33
00:01:39,631 --> 00:01:40,299
Speaker 0: Actually, you know what?

34
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,619
Speaker 1: Then you do a yoga, then I have to do it?

35
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:48,759
Speaker 0: It's impractical simply for the fact that no one is a video game renaissance man anymore, because there's too many genres.

36
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:53,560
Speaker 0: I'd love to see you in a megathon around, or a finale that was video game horse.

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,940
Speaker 0: Like, each candidate gives them like, here are the 10 horse things I will present to the other person.

38
00:02:00,683 --> 00:02:05,320
Speaker 1: No, pick like 10, or some odd number, 9.

39
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,880
Speaker 1: You know, direct versus 1 versus 1 games that are short.

40
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:13,620
Speaker 1: And you have to win 5 out of 4 rounds, and it's like, street fighter, go!

41
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,840
Speaker 1: Then it's like, so it's a fighting game, then it's like, you know, some other, you know, racing game, go!

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,097
Speaker 0: I was thinking more like, you pick, you know...

43
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:22,039
Speaker 1: Othello, go!

44
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,360
Speaker 0: Within a constrained set, you're like, alright, you know, just like they do for trick pool tournaments.

45
00:02:27,621 --> 00:02:31,640
Speaker 0: I will beat ball bull with only using jabs.

46
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,298
Speaker 0: Right, jabs.

47
00:02:34,101 --> 00:02:36,899
Speaker 0: And then you do it, and then the other guy has to do the same thing.

48
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:47,780
Speaker 1: The thing is, it was just the person who made the challenge would maybe sometimes fail, you know, and the person who was being challenged would hardly ever be able to succeed.

49
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it works better in trick pool, because there's a very constrained set of pool skills.

50
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:54,380
Speaker 0: So maybe you set it to like, one game.

51
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,385
Speaker 1: Still, yoga tournament?

52
00:02:56,445 --> 00:02:59,920
Speaker 1: I mean, I could look this up on the internet to figure out how competitive yoga works.

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,840
Speaker 0: But I'm just going to assume that it's street fighter.

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,699
Speaker 1: But it's much more fun to make fun of it than to look it up.

55
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,179
Speaker 1: Though I probably will look it up when I get home.

56
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:08,157
Speaker 0: Yoga flame.

57
00:03:09,244 --> 00:03:09,799
Speaker 1: Yoga flame.

58
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:15,680
Speaker 0: So it's Wednesday, and you know, sadly, a couple of people have pointed out in the forums, we haven't talked about a lot of anime recently.

59
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,800
Speaker 1: There really hasn't been a lot of anime recently.

60
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,900
Speaker 0: Well, there has been, but the last anime I watched was Madoka Magica.

61
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:24,043
Speaker 0: Yeah.

62
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,659
Speaker 0: The last anime I watched before that, I'm still kind of watching Fist of the North Star, but I'm reading Drops of God.

63
00:03:32,762 --> 00:03:34,720
Speaker 0: I'm playing a lot of video games lately.

64
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:35,480
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

65
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,420
Speaker 0: It's not anime season.

66
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:37,820
Speaker 1: No, it really isn't.

67
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:49,000
Speaker 1: Another thing I noticed, right, is that, I've been reading, instead of Anime News Network, the Crunchyroll news, I think has been, you know, mostly the same, but also a little bit better.

68
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:49,287
Speaker 1: Nah.

69
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:49,861
Speaker 1: Right?

70
00:03:50,203 --> 00:03:53,260
Speaker 1: But there was an article on there, this isn't my news, this is just relevant, right?

71
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:57,140
Speaker 1: This is Japanese fans name the most needed anime sequels, right?

72
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:01,847
Speaker 0: Wait a minute, wait a minute, I wonder, before you tell me, what- So they had a poll, and it's almost 2,000.

73
00:04:01,847 --> 00:04:05,120
Speaker 1: Japanese fans name the anime series most in need of a sequel.

74
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:12,520
Speaker 0: Because I want to see the same thing in the US, because I, if I had to say something, it's literally Ghost in the Shell Stand Alone Complex is all I want.

75
00:04:12,761 --> 00:04:18,120
Speaker 0: Crap, wait a minute, anyway- No, I don't want, I don't actually want more Cowboy Bebop, because I know why.

76
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,959
Speaker 1: But the point is, if you look at this list, it's like, Angel Beats is number one.

77
00:04:22,004 --> 00:04:22,200
Speaker 1: What?

78
00:04:23,264 --> 00:04:24,599
Speaker 1: Ha-ru-si-suzumi is two.

79
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,819
Speaker 0: I could see that, I could see that, I could watch more of that.

80
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,509
Speaker 1: Natsume Yuu-jin Show is three.

81
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,300
Speaker 1: Working with an exclamation point is four.

82
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:53,825
Speaker 1: Clannad, After Story, then K-On, then Full Metal Panic, Second Raid, which is a sequel, so I guess they want another sequel, Minami-kei, Squid Girl, Zansayonara Zetsubo Sensei, The World, God Only Knows, My Ordinary Life, Usagi Drop, Sekirei, Rosen Maiden, Genshiken 2, Initial D, Fourth Stage- No, you don't need- Toradora, Okami-san,

83
00:04:54,326 --> 00:04:55,248
Speaker 0: The Strongest

84
00:04:55,348 --> 00:05:02,348
Speaker 1: Disciple, Kenichi, Banner of the Stars 3, Spicenwolf 2, Strike Witches, Elfin'

85
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:03,558
Speaker 0: Lead,

86
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:03,880
Speaker 1: right?

87
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:12,339
Speaker 1: And it's like, most of the animes, if you look at those JPEGs that show you all the animes coming out, most of them we don't give a shit about.

88
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:20,542
Speaker 1: All I want, now here's the thing- Madoka 2, I take that, but that isn't on the list, they don't want Madoka 2.

89
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:22,237
Speaker 0: I wouldn't want Madoka 2 either-.

90
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,983
Speaker 0: Well, here's the thing, I don't want Madoka 2, the same reason I don't want Cowboy Bebop 2.

91
00:05:27,983 --> 00:05:28,941
Speaker 1: I'll take Madoka 2.

92
00:05:28,941 --> 00:05:31,020
Speaker 1: However- More than I'll take Angel Beats 2.

93
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,859
Speaker 0: What did Cowboy Bebop do to get around that?

94
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:36,480
Speaker 0: They set the movie in the middle of the show with no ramifications outside.

95
00:05:37,365 --> 00:05:37,535
Speaker 1: Anyway.

96
00:05:38,100 --> 00:05:41,580
Speaker 0: But if there was a Madoka sequel, I'd actually want it to be a prequel.

97
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:45,518
Speaker 0: I want to see like, imagine if they did a Madoka OAV or something.

98
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:49,080
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I would call the show Magical Homura.

99
00:05:50,602 --> 00:05:53,160
Speaker 0: Well, there's two ways to handle this.

100
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:58,860
Speaker 0: You go for the fan fulfillment, which is Homura the Badass kicking ass all around the world.

101
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:02,940
Speaker 1: That's right, the name of the show would be Magical Badass Homura, the end.

102
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:11,440
Speaker 0: But my real serious suggestion would be another show, like 13 episodes, and maybe it's 13 vignettes, maybe a few two-parters in there.

103
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,619
Speaker 1: Well, they wanted to make, you know, Happy School Days Madoka.

104
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,298
Speaker 0: No, don't do that!

105
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:19,020
Speaker 1: That's what they wanted, that's what the guy said he was thinking about making.

106
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:22,380
Speaker 1: Cause he didn't get enough school days in the regular Madoka.

107
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,738
Speaker 0: That's the worst possible idea.

108
00:06:24,501 --> 00:06:26,339
Speaker 0: Short of showing me all the bad endings.

109
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:27,140
Speaker 0: That's right.

110
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:34,540
Speaker 0: But what I would do is, you know, I have a show that's prequels, and every episode is some magical girl from some point in history.

111
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,779
Speaker 0: Because this goes, you know, not to spoil stuff, but I... You just did.

112
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:40,220
Speaker 0: I spoiled a little bit, I didn't spoil the real spoils.

113
00:06:40,801 --> 00:06:47,020
Speaker 0: I want to see like, the Cleopatra magical girl, and the Greek magical girl, and the Indian magical girl.

114
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,600
Speaker 1: Well, you can watch Tezuka's Cleopatra.

115
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:49,279
Speaker 0: I could.

116
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:49,880
Speaker 1: Anyway.

117
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,158
Speaker 1: But that's what I would do.

118
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:56,820
Speaker 1: But the point is, just the reason that there's not so much new animes, is cause the Japanese fans don't like good animes.

119
00:06:57,260 --> 00:07:00,120
Speaker 1: They're making too many Moe shows, not making enough good shows.

120
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:04,540
Speaker 0: The Japanese fans who care enough to respond to online polls about said thing.

121
00:07:05,121 --> 00:07:09,740
Speaker 1: I know, but the point is, it seems like if you look at those JPEGs that say what anime are they coming out, most of them are...

122
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:18,980
Speaker 0: Scott, go to the average American, and do an online poll that only targets people who are super into American comics, and ask them what superhero needs another comic.

123
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,340
Speaker 1: Then explain why most of the animes coming out are targeting this market.

124
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:27,140
Speaker 0: Uh, partly because that is probably a cheap and easy market to target.

125
00:07:27,622 --> 00:07:28,820
Speaker 1: Anyway, you get the idea.

126
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,120
Speaker 1: What new animes are coming out that aren't Moe crap?

127
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:33,617
Speaker 1: Ghost in the Shell, Stand Alone, Gold Bricks, third gig.

128
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:35,319
Speaker 1: That's actually coming out.

129
00:07:36,042 --> 00:07:36,438
Speaker 0: It's coming.

130
00:07:38,085 --> 00:07:39,300
Speaker 0: I gotta be optimistic here.

131
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,620
Speaker 0: I'd love to see that survey on American anime fans.

132
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,192
Speaker 1: I would also.

133
00:07:45,274 --> 00:07:45,500
Speaker 1: Anyway.

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,519
Speaker 1: So here's some actual news, right?

135
00:07:48,022 --> 00:07:49,299
Speaker 1: And I learned something from this news.

136
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:54,000
Speaker 1: There are some mangas that have been on hiatus or away for various reasons.

137
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:56,719
Speaker 0: Like every super long running series that did Mend?

138
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,757
Speaker 1: That they're coming back.

139
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,739
Speaker 1: Bastard is coming back.

140
00:08:00,263 --> 00:08:00,648
Speaker 0: March 19th.

141
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:07,099
Speaker 0: That's bad, because the fact that Bastard was on hiatus meant that there was a chance I could somehow catch up.

142
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,239
Speaker 1: Arakawa, Under the Bridgy Bridge, coming back.

143
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:12,019
Speaker 0: I kind of want to watch and/or read that.

144
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:14,240
Speaker 1: Saint Young Men, that's the one with Buddha and Jesus.

145
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,511
Speaker 1: Also coming back.

146
00:08:15,531 --> 00:08:15,919
Speaker 1: You know why?

147
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:16,629
Speaker 1: I didn't know this.

148
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,280
Speaker 1: I learned something.

149
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:20,539
Speaker 1: Arakawa, Under the Bridge, and Saint Young Men.

150
00:08:20,941 --> 00:08:21,588
Speaker 1: Same person.

151
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:22,580
Speaker 1: She was on maternity leave.

152
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:22,943
Speaker 1: What?

153
00:08:23,145 --> 00:08:24,340
Speaker 1: I didn't know that either.

154
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,440
Speaker 1: I didn't know that, but now I do.

155
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,840
Speaker 1: And I started reading Saint Young Men on scans because she apparently people have tried to license it and she refuses.

156
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:34,139
Speaker 1: She doesn't want anyone to put it out in different countries.

157
00:08:34,702 --> 00:08:36,460
Speaker 1: So I've been reading it illegally, whatever.

158
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,019
Speaker 1: I don't care.

159
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:39,700
Speaker 1: And it's kind of awesome.

160
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,740
Speaker 1: It's Buddha and Jesus, their roommates in Japan.

161
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,740
Speaker 0: Emily's got it, because she can read Japanese.

162
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,258
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's coming back.

163
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,039
Speaker 1: Because again, maternity leave, she's done.

164
00:08:48,421 --> 00:08:49,440
Speaker 1: With the babying, right?

165
00:08:49,902 --> 00:08:50,959
Speaker 1: And you know what else is coming back?

166
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:53,619
Speaker 1: You're not going to believe this one, right?

167
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,859
Speaker 0: Elf Princess Rain.

168
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:56,186
Speaker 0: No.

169
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:04,769
Speaker 1: The mystery adventure series Master Keaton ran in big comic original for 18 volumes and now it's returning.

170
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:12,020
Speaker 1: According to the band on volume 8, the series we released Keaton will be returning with Master Keaton remaster set 20 years after the original.

171
00:09:12,604 --> 00:09:12,849
Speaker 0: What?

172
00:09:12,869 --> 00:09:13,278
Speaker 0: Whoa, whoa.

173
00:09:14,006 --> 00:09:14,899
Speaker 1: I want to read this.

174
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:17,740
Speaker 1: Whether this will be an ongoing or one shot has not been specified.

175
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:18,286
Speaker 0: Don't care.

176
00:09:18,327 --> 00:09:18,894
Speaker 0: Want to read.

177
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:19,380
Speaker 1: Won't be in English.

178
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,179
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I haven't read the irregular mangas.

179
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:23,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I saw the cartoon and that's good enough.

180
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:27,360
Speaker 0: The problem is, nobody in America likes Master Keaton except us.

181
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,300
Speaker 1: Right, but the thing here, right, is like, okay, so there's some mangas coming back from hiatus.

182
00:09:32,383 --> 00:09:37,779
Speaker 1: This isn't really enough to say there's a trend here, especially since two out of the four are, you know, one person.

183
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,339
Speaker 1: It is if there's no other news.

184
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:49,540
Speaker 1: Right, but I mean, like, is there a trend of like old mangas coming back you know, for a reprise or encore or is or is this just, you know, a coincidence?

185
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:53,560
Speaker 1: okay, these four and it's not really a trend or something that's going to happen a lot.

186
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:57,680
Speaker 0: I'm going with coincidence and call me back if Ranma starts up again.

187
00:09:57,840 --> 00:10:04,207
Speaker 1: Yeah, because I mean, it could be that like, you know, the manga publishers in Japan are like man, these new mangas aren't doing so well.

188
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:12,125
Speaker 1: Let's go and get the creators of the old manga to sort of start them up again and maybe that will sell better to the nostalgia crowd.

189
00:10:12,145 --> 00:10:14,812
Speaker 1: You know, that could be a thing that happens.

190
00:10:14,832 --> 00:10:16,106
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's happening right now.

191
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,320
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

192
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,719
Speaker 1: I don't know either, but it's a possibility.

193
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,670
Speaker 0: Because like, Bastard is a very kind of special odd case.

194
00:10:22,711 --> 00:10:24,306
Speaker 0: We could do, we should do a show on Bastard.

195
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,659
Speaker 1: We have to watch Bastard again.

196
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,716
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, well, we should read some too.

197
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:31,679
Speaker 0: Oh my god, let's watch Bastard again and do a show on it.

198
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:34,281
Speaker 0: I haven't seen Bastard since it was like 3 am at RIT.

199
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,840
Speaker 1: Have you ever done a show on Gokudo?

200
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,126
Speaker 0: Gokudo?

201
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:38,806
Speaker 0: I don't think we ever did a show on it.

202
00:10:38,826 --> 00:10:40,199
Speaker 0: We didn't even finish Gokudo.

203
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:40,805
Speaker 0: We should.

204
00:10:40,968 --> 00:10:42,932
Speaker 0: We watched like the first eight episodes.

205
00:10:42,973 --> 00:10:47,880
Speaker 1: It kind of, you know, it started out pretty fun and then it was less fun as he kept going.

206
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,666
Speaker 0: As things go.

207
00:10:48,869 --> 00:10:49,091
Speaker 0: Yeah.

208
00:10:49,657 --> 00:11:00,292
Speaker 0: Anyway, so speaking of reading and watching things illegally, Oricon had a, Oricon Communications had a questionnaire where they asked people stuff about media.

209
00:11:00,313 --> 00:11:11,869
Speaker 0: and supposedly in Japan based on these responses, 28 and a half percent of Japanese middle and high school students have illegally downloaded.

210
00:11:12,051 --> 00:11:14,193
Speaker 1: Well, did they, I mean, admitted to legally downloading?

211
00:11:14,214 --> 00:11:14,800
Speaker 1: because it was a survey.

212
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:17,630
Speaker 0: I point out that I'm really interested in this.

213
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:24,860
Speaker 0: So, alright, 28 percent have ever downloaded anything illegally.

214
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:39,248
Speaker 0: Either that number is completely wrong or Japan is way different from the rest of the world because I think in America the survey answer would actually be like 99 percent.

215
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:39,838
Speaker 1: Yeah.

216
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,460
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, you know, that's a survey.

217
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,792
Speaker 1: There's people admitting to it, right?

218
00:11:43,812 --> 00:11:45,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time it's weird because I'll admit to stuff.

219
00:11:45,912 --> 00:11:48,395
Speaker 1: But also you've got to remember how many people are even internet-y, right?

220
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:53,932
Speaker 1: So it's like all the non-internet-y people are, you know, that's probably more than half right there.

221
00:11:54,316 --> 00:11:56,440
Speaker 1: But a hundred percent of the internet-y people definitely.

222
00:11:57,782 --> 00:12:00,333
Speaker 1: And then there's people who don't realize, you know, so it's...

223
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:04,236
Speaker 0: Japan's copyright law actually changed and I didn't even know this.

224
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:05,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like arrest people for shit.

225
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,295
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

226
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:16,275
Speaker 0: No, so they changed the law and apparently it is actually illegal to download copyrighted material, which has never really been proven to be illegal in the US.

227
00:12:16,699 --> 00:12:18,900
Speaker 0: Only distribution has been gone after.

228
00:12:19,404 --> 00:12:21,280
Speaker 0: But in Japan they go after consumption.

229
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:22,083
Speaker 0: Yep.

230
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:23,100
Speaker 0: Which is interesting.

231
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:27,404
Speaker 1: Like if you download some, you know, animes in Japan, you could go to jail.

232
00:12:27,424 --> 00:12:31,385
Speaker 1: Like criminal, not they need to sue you, but like the police will just come after you.

233
00:12:31,749 --> 00:12:32,800
Speaker 1: And they're like watching the internet.

234
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:33,626
Speaker 1: It's crazy.

235
00:12:34,111 --> 00:12:35,808
Speaker 0: But at the same time, they're also really...

236
00:12:35,828 --> 00:12:36,354
Speaker 1: Singapore too.

237
00:12:36,374 --> 00:12:37,909
Speaker 1: Singapore is just as bad in their respect.

238
00:12:37,929 --> 00:12:45,475
Speaker 0: Japan's also really down on re-importation, which is, you know, basically legal, and yet undercuts their domestic production almost as much.

239
00:12:46,642 --> 00:12:50,064
Speaker 0: No, I would argue it doesn't anymore because hardly anything's getting released in the US.

240
00:12:50,084 --> 00:12:52,690
Speaker 1: Plus remember, this also is only counting teenagers.

241
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:58,872
Speaker 1: So like, are the 30 year olds downloading a lot more than the 20 year olds than the, you know, 13 to 18 year olds?

242
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:06,992
Speaker 0: I also I really wonder what the actual rates are, because like I said, in America, I think even people like age 30, 40 the rate is like 100%.

243
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:08,830
Speaker 0: Because one of the first things my parents asked me...

244
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:09,840
Speaker 1: Of internetty people.

245
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,649
Speaker 0: When we got broadband was, so how do I download music?

246
00:13:12,669 --> 00:13:16,771
Speaker 1: Those people at the jury duty who didn't even read a book while they were there and just stared at the TV?

247
00:13:16,973 --> 00:13:19,120
Speaker 1: They're not downloading anything illegally, and they're the majority.

248
00:13:20,024 --> 00:13:25,860
Speaker 0: You know, you say that, but they probably have like an iPod, like an old one or something, and they probably just download stuff.

249
00:13:26,042 --> 00:13:26,347
Speaker 1: Maybe.

250
00:13:26,652 --> 00:13:27,160
Speaker 1: It's possible.

251
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:36,027
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

252
00:13:36,149 --> 00:13:42,593
Speaker 0: So I did not know this existed, and Emily the other day was like, "Hey, this is a

253
00:13:42,653 --> 00:13:42,876
Speaker 0: thing.".

254
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:43,300
Speaker 0: And I was like,

255
00:13:44,789 --> 00:13:45,096
Speaker 0: "What?".

256
00:13:45,117 --> 00:14:01,826
Speaker 0: So apparently, when Deke got the rights to Sailor Moon in the US back in the day, one of the options they considered was to not actually release Sailor Moon as it was in Japan, and to just take the characters and make their own show.

257
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:02,694
Speaker 1: Why would you do that?

258
00:14:02,714 --> 00:14:09,320
Speaker 1: It would cost money to make your own show, but if you just take the show that already exists, it doesn't cause nearly as much money to just put it out there.

259
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,129
Speaker 0: Because one, the licensing cost probably would have been less.

260
00:14:12,596 --> 00:14:27,098
Speaker 0: Two, they then would not have had to localize and westernize and dumb down and all the stuff that they ended up having to do with the Sailor Moon because they wanted to pretend it wasn't in Japan, and pretend that it wasn't actually, you know, a show for slightly older girls.

261
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,057
Speaker 1: Why didn't they just let it be in Japan?

262
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:31,179
Speaker 0: Scott, you really, really asked that.

263
00:14:32,468 --> 00:14:33,540
Speaker 0: That's how people have been.

264
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:43,300
Speaker 0: So anyway, not only were they going to remake it and reanimate it, but they were only going to reanimate half of it, because the other half was live action.

265
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,733
Speaker 1: Well, that was the trend in those days, right?

266
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:52,350
Speaker 1: You could save a lot of money by making a show, you know, partially live action in a lot of these cheap filler scenes, and then using other stuff for the rest.

267
00:14:52,370 --> 00:14:53,680
Speaker 0: Like, Power Rangers.

268
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,832
Speaker 1: Power Rangers in the US.

269
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,826
Speaker 1: You have some English US actors act out these in-between scenes.

270
00:14:57,866 --> 00:15:00,068
Speaker 0: And then an unrelated Sentai show.

271
00:15:00,088 --> 00:15:03,825
Speaker 1: Then you just dub over this other Sentai show for the fighting monster scenes.

272
00:15:04,007 --> 00:15:06,999
Speaker 1: Or, you know, a lot of VR Troopers, same kind of thing.

273
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:10,112
Speaker 1: Superhuman Samurai, Cyber Squad, same thing.

274
00:15:10,133 --> 00:15:26,399
Speaker 0: So, what's amazing is that in 1995 at Anime Expo, that's before I knew anime cons existed, someone showed the only screening I have ever been able to find.

275
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,900
Speaker 1: The thing I don't understand is why would you show this to anime fans at Anime Expo?

276
00:15:30,984 --> 00:15:32,176
Speaker 0: I think the reason is apparent.

277
00:15:32,196 --> 00:15:35,470
Speaker 0: The audience is dumbstruck by this thing.

278
00:15:36,055 --> 00:15:37,066
Speaker 0: It's pretty amazing.

279
00:15:37,106 --> 00:15:40,117
Speaker 0: So, bonus points about this are that 1.

280
00:15:40,117 --> 00:15:48,040
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon is also in a wheelchair, and the cast is diverse to a degree that would make Captain Planet cringe at the political correctness.

281
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:54,639
Speaker 0: But she can walk around just fine in the animated part, but she has a wheelchair mech in that part.

282
00:15:55,624 --> 00:16:01,979
Speaker 0: And I think the icing on the cake is that they made them literal sailors sailing things through space.

283
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:02,722
Speaker 1: Right.

284
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,198
Speaker 1: Well, because kids wouldn't understand.

285
00:16:04,238 --> 00:16:05,247
Speaker 1: Like, "She's called Sailor Moon.

286
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:05,953
Speaker 1: How come she doesn't have a

287
00:16:05,993 --> 00:16:06,195
Speaker 1: boat?".

288
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:10,011
Speaker 0: It's... This is pretty dangerous.

289
00:16:10,072 --> 00:16:11,626
Speaker 0: This is anime hell territory.

290
00:16:11,687 --> 00:16:16,254
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure this has already been in anime hell, and we just weren't at that anime hell.

291
00:16:16,294 --> 00:16:19,769
Speaker 0: Yeah, the number of views on this video is pretty low, so, uh...

292
00:16:19,931 --> 00:16:22,032
Speaker 1: There might have been other times posted to YouTube.

293
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:23,485
Speaker 0: I want to get the word out.

294
00:16:23,667 --> 00:16:28,939
Speaker 0: I want people to, uh, know that this is a thing, and that it is perhaps one of the worst things the world has ever seen.

295
00:16:29,140 --> 00:16:29,261
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

296
00:16:29,949 --> 00:16:32,112
Speaker 1: So, my thing of the day is the best, right?

297
00:16:32,152 --> 00:16:35,585
Speaker 1: For many years, I have been looking for things like this, right?

298
00:16:36,151 --> 00:16:42,720
Speaker 1: And it has been hard to find things like this, which is something that was originally English, but was dubbed in some other country.

299
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,600
Speaker 1: Because other countries tend to just sort of subtitle.

300
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:45,241
Speaker 1: True.

301
00:16:45,281 --> 00:16:49,669
Speaker 1: And you only get the weird... And a lot of times, you get stuff like Turkish Star Wars, where it isn't even a dub.

302
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:52,233
Speaker 1: It's just, like, some, you know, remake rip-off thing, right?

303
00:16:52,899 --> 00:16:58,240
Speaker 1: And, you know, it's kind of hard to find dubs of stuff from the US that is in other languages.

304
00:16:59,383 --> 00:17:01,991
Speaker 1: Uh, and at least, you know, even if you do find dubs, they're not that interesting.

305
00:17:02,011 --> 00:17:04,898
Speaker 1: Like, I watched Spanish ET once in high school and Spanish class.

306
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:05,925
Speaker 1: Or, like, the Lion King.

307
00:17:05,946 --> 00:17:06,900
Speaker 1: Oh, it's middle school, not high school.

308
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:08,172
Speaker 0: I watched the Lion King in French.

309
00:17:08,232 --> 00:17:09,895
Speaker 0: It's just perfect and in French.

310
00:17:10,037 --> 00:17:10,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

311
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:13,191
Speaker 1: Right?

312
00:17:13,453 --> 00:17:14,901
Speaker 1: You know, but, I mean, there's nothing funny about that.

313
00:17:14,921 --> 00:17:16,239
Speaker 1: There's nothing good to go with, right?

314
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:21,709
Speaker 1: So, here is, right, thanks to, I guess, I assume Patrick Massey is Crunchyroll News, right?

315
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:24,339
Speaker 1: It was actually in a link to something from another story.

316
00:17:25,402 --> 00:17:28,173
Speaker 1: This is the Japanese dub of Star Wars, right?

317
00:17:28,252 --> 00:17:30,395
Speaker 1: Which is actually really good.

318
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:33,202
Speaker 1: Like, you're watching it and you're like, "Damn, that is some good dubbing right

319
00:17:33,222 --> 00:17:33,505
Speaker 1: there.".

320
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:37,809
Speaker 1: But, specifically, this video isn't just the Japanese dub of Star Wars.

321
00:17:38,133 --> 00:17:43,831
Speaker 1: It's specifically all 11 minutes and 18 seconds of Lando Calrissian screen time.

322
00:17:43,851 --> 00:17:44,359
Speaker 1: Uh-oh.

323
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:48,456
Speaker 1: In the, uh, you know, Japanese Star Wars.

324
00:17:48,517 --> 00:17:51,407
Speaker 1: It's just all of Lando's screen time cut up out of the movies.

325
00:17:51,427 --> 00:17:52,700
Speaker 0: It's got the danger alert.

326
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,829
Speaker 0: Something that hasn't gone off many times in my life is going out.

327
00:17:56,254 --> 00:17:58,940
Speaker 0: This is, this is edging into most territory right here.

328
00:17:59,142 --> 00:17:59,425
Speaker 1: Right.

329
00:18:00,091 --> 00:18:05,890
Speaker 1: And, you know, so it's pretty much, you're watching all of Star Wars but only the Lando Calrissian parts in the Japanese dub.

330
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:08,439
Speaker 1: There's no other modifications to this video whatsoever.

331
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:12,014
Speaker 0: So, is the moral of this, that there are two options.

332
00:18:12,176 --> 00:18:21,687
Speaker 0: Either Japan found someone amazing to do that voice, or they actually did a good job with a black man's voice in Japanese.

333
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:22,535
Speaker 1: Okay.

334
00:18:22,777 --> 00:18:26,617
Speaker 1: So, uh, first of all, the dub is amazing overall.

335
00:18:26,718 --> 00:18:27,506
Speaker 1: Like, just watching it.

336
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:28,131
Speaker 1: Like, oh, Leia.

337
00:18:28,212 --> 00:18:31,243
Speaker 1: Oh, and the C-3PO voice, and the Darth Vader voice is pretty good.

338
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:31,788
Speaker 0: Overall.

339
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:35,759
Speaker 1: Can you, can you guess at the reason that it is a Lando Calrissian?

340
00:18:38,552 --> 00:18:41,076
Speaker 0: Ah, all the Japanese are stupid.

341
00:18:41,218 --> 00:18:41,985
Speaker 0: I hate all Japanese.

342
00:18:42,025 --> 00:18:43,317
Speaker 0: Is it one of those situations?

343
00:18:43,963 --> 00:18:50,456
Speaker 1: The voice of Lando Calrissian in Japanese Star Wars is it?

344
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:53,116
Speaker 1: Oh my God, it really is.

345
00:18:53,136 --> 00:18:58,836
Speaker 1: It absolutely is.

346
00:18:59,058 --> 00:18:59,866
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

347
00:18:59,886 --> 00:19:01,138
Speaker 1: It is amazing.

348
00:19:01,198 --> 00:19:02,350
Speaker 1: So, is the greatest.

349
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:05,809
Speaker 0: So, he is now actually my favorite voice actor.

350
00:19:06,272 --> 00:19:07,602
Speaker 0: My second favorite voice actor.

351
00:19:07,884 --> 00:19:15,789
Speaker 1: He is like Because it's pretty much uh, Koyasu, him, and uh, Akira Kamiya.

352
00:19:20,593 --> 00:19:21,706
Speaker 1: He doesn't talk to Yoda ever.

353
00:19:21,787 --> 00:19:22,030
Speaker 1: I know.

354
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:23,722
Speaker 1: He doesn't even see Yoda.

355
00:19:23,763 --> 00:19:24,949
Speaker 1: Yoda's only ever talks to Luke.

356
00:19:27,114 --> 00:19:28,029
Speaker 0: That's some good stuff.

357
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:32,430
Speaker 1: But yes, Norio Wakamoto is the voice of Lando Calrissian in Japan.

358
00:19:32,550 --> 00:19:33,358
Speaker 1: Does a great job.

359
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:34,489
Speaker 0: Oh my gosh.

360
00:19:35,152 --> 00:19:35,700
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

361
00:19:35,964 --> 00:19:39,321
Speaker 0: So, in the meta moment, Easter weekend, which is coming up pretty soon.

362
00:19:39,341 --> 00:19:42,026
Speaker 0: We will be at the Pinair Gate Expo doing one lecture.

363
00:19:42,046 --> 00:19:43,784
Speaker 0: Let's play a money making game.

364
00:19:44,147 --> 00:19:45,239
Speaker 1: We will all be doing one.

365
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,310
Speaker 1: Ten, thirty, fifty.

366
00:19:46,670 --> 00:19:53,399
Speaker 0: We will be doing one two hour classroom workshop on how to play some German style board games.

367
00:19:53,864 --> 00:19:54,390
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah.

368
00:19:54,630 --> 00:19:58,070
Speaker 0: And we will be at Anime Boston doing diamonds in the rough.

369
00:19:58,610 --> 00:19:59,277
Speaker 1: And eating dinner.

370
00:19:59,802 --> 00:20:03,909
Speaker 0: We will also be at the going cardboard uh, screening where we will say hi.

371
00:20:05,196 --> 00:20:05,236
Speaker 0: Hi.

372
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,337
Speaker 0: To people who want to say hi to us.

373
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:07,842
Speaker 1: Great.

374
00:20:08,267 --> 00:20:11,588
Speaker 0: Otherwise, we're pretty much going to be in tabletop playing games the entire time.

375
00:20:12,573 --> 00:20:14,250
Speaker 1: Except for like an hour in the expo hall or something.

376
00:20:14,552 --> 00:20:16,050
Speaker 0: And an hour or so at the Whiskey Priest.

377
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:17,750
Speaker 0: And the illegal test kitchen.

378
00:20:18,251 --> 00:20:18,413
Speaker 1: Yep.

379
00:20:18,433 --> 00:20:20,677
Speaker 1: Other meta things.

380
00:20:20,718 --> 00:20:21,829
Speaker 1: Do we have a new book club book?

381
00:20:22,312 --> 00:20:22,979
Speaker 0: Uh, yes we do.

382
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:25,285
Speaker 0: But I'll announce that in the separate book club episode.

383
00:20:25,407 --> 00:20:25,609
Speaker 1: Okay.

384
00:20:26,832 --> 00:20:28,190
Speaker 1: Do we have internets?

385
00:20:28,311 --> 00:20:28,655
Speaker 1: We do.

386
00:20:28,756 --> 00:20:30,070
Speaker 1: You should visit us on the internets.

387
00:20:30,190 --> 00:20:32,938
Speaker 1: A lot of people, they subscribe to this show on iTunes or something.

388
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:34,330
Speaker 1: They listen to it maybe.

389
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,837
Speaker 1: But they never visit us on the internets.

390
00:20:36,877 --> 00:20:37,929
Speaker 1: Well, we have internets.

391
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:40,086
Speaker 1: You should go to twitter.com/geeknights.

392

00:21:02,603 --> 00:21:09,613
Speaker 0: In particular, the Geek Nights Rim YouTube channel, our official YouTube channel, has many of our panels and lectures throughout the recent years.

404
00:21:09,815 --> 00:21:15,833
Speaker 0: And I just uploaded a new video that if you weren't already going out of your mind waiting for PAX, this video is probably...

405
00:21:15,853 --> 00:21:19,530
Speaker 1: You know how many, there's only like 36 37 days till PAX East.

406
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:20,296
Speaker 0: It's coming.

407
00:21:20,498 --> 00:21:21,308
Speaker 1: It's real close.

408
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:22,341
Speaker 1: I gotta get that panel together.

409
00:21:22,382 --> 00:21:22,970
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do it this week.

410
00:21:23,332 --> 00:21:24,159
Speaker 1: I'm doing it this week.

411
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:25,430
Speaker 0: I gotta get all the other panels together.

412
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,600
Speaker 1: I'm doing it this weekend.

413
00:21:26,621 --> 00:21:28,055
Speaker 1: I'm putting together the money making game.

414
00:21:28,075 --> 00:21:29,775
Speaker 1: I know what the first slide is.

415
00:21:32,154 --> 00:21:32,729
Speaker 0: Old man.

416
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:39,812
Speaker 1: Oh man, why you give me useless hint for 50?

417
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:43,880
Speaker 0: So... So the other day, a conversation that I never thought would happen happened.

418
00:21:43,921 --> 00:21:48,408
Speaker 0: Scott comes to me and says, "Hey, we should do a show on Sailor

419
00:21:48,448 --> 00:21:48,630
Speaker 0: Moon.".

420
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,336
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, Rim is the biggest Sailor Moon nut there is.

421
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:52,830
Speaker 0: No, that is not true.

422
00:21:52,910 --> 00:21:53,880
Speaker 1: He's a huge Sailor Moon nut.

423
00:21:53,941 --> 00:21:55,719
Speaker 0: I am not actually a big fan of Sailor Moon.

424
00:21:55,739 --> 00:21:57,315
Speaker 1: Yes, you are a gigantic fan of Sailor Moon.

425
00:21:57,497 --> 00:22:01,378
Speaker 1: And it's a very important anime in the US especially.

426
00:22:01,398 --> 00:22:05,820
Speaker 1: And we'd never done a show on it and we really needed some anime shows.

427
00:22:06,103 --> 00:22:09,717
Speaker 1: So I'm like, "Hey, that's a good show to do an episode on.

428
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:12,954
Speaker 1: Let's watch some kind of Sailor Moon something.

429
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:14,809
Speaker 1: Since you're such a big fan, you know what to watch.

430
00:22:15,551 --> 00:22:17,497
Speaker 1: Let's watch something and then do an episode on

431
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:17,578
Speaker 1: it.".

432
00:22:18,163 --> 00:22:22,427
Speaker 0: Back in the day, I watched Vampire 100D when I was in fourth grade.

433
00:22:22,487 --> 00:22:23,781
Speaker 0: My little brother was in second grade.

434
00:22:24,286 --> 00:22:25,013
Speaker 0: And it was a big deal.

435
00:22:25,074 --> 00:22:26,004
Speaker 0: And I really got into anime.

436
00:22:26,024 --> 00:22:28,005
Speaker 0: And I watched all the anime Blockbuster.

437
00:22:28,025 --> 00:22:28,450
Speaker 0: And then what?

438
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,960
Speaker 0: Like, then what do I do?

439
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:30,690
Speaker 0: Go to Suncoast?

440
00:22:31,052 --> 00:22:32,530
Speaker 0: There's like four more shows to watch.

441
00:22:32,712 --> 00:22:33,463
Speaker 0: Now I've seen all that.

442
00:22:33,483 --> 00:22:33,929
Speaker 0: Now what?

443
00:22:34,791 --> 00:22:37,537
Speaker 0: So I eventually found fan subs.

444
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:44,830
Speaker 0: And the first fan sub I ever got, I actually got tapes mailed to me of all of Sailor Moon.

445
00:22:45,550 --> 00:22:46,119
Speaker 1: A big show.

446
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:49,113
Speaker 1: Every letter like regular Sailor Moon, S, R, Q, P, T.

447
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:55,055
Speaker 0: I have VHS's made from the original laserdisc releases with English subtitles.

448
00:22:55,075 --> 00:22:58,270
Speaker 1: Of every single episode, OAV and movie of Sailor Moon ever?

449
00:22:58,853 --> 00:22:59,277
Speaker 0: In order?

450
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:06,670
Speaker 0: Every bit of animation ever related to Sailor Moon directly is in fact on VHS format in boxes somewhere.

451
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:07,636
Speaker 1: In your possession?

452
00:23:07,798 --> 00:23:13,655
Speaker 0: And the cases themselves had color print out scans of the laserdisc covers.

453
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,438
Speaker 0: They are super pro.

454
00:23:15,458 --> 00:23:20,869
Speaker 1: Is this in, you know, you watch including the movie we just watched is also in there?

455
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:21,475
Speaker 0: Uh, yes.

456
00:23:21,718 --> 00:23:24,710
Speaker 0: All three movies plus the special Ami-chan the Hopsicle.

457
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,330
Speaker 1: How much did this cost you in those days?

458
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:26,850
Speaker 1: $240.

459
00:23:26,850 --> 00:23:27,821
Speaker 0: That's pretty cheap.

460
00:23:28,831 --> 00:23:32,109
Speaker 0: For shipping and the cost of the tapes because I had to buy all the tapes.

461
00:23:32,931 --> 00:23:37,922
Speaker 0: Now I could have had him ship me SVHS's which would have been higher quality, but...

462
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,214
Speaker 1: You need an SVHS player.

463
00:23:39,396 --> 00:23:40,750
Speaker 0: I had an SVHS player.

464
00:23:41,210 --> 00:23:41,842
Speaker 0: Whoa!

465
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:48,130
Speaker 0: I was not confident I would have another one ever, nor was I confident that anyone would let me take that thing to college.

466
00:23:49,131 --> 00:23:50,390
Speaker 0: I don't even know where it is anymore.

467
00:23:51,011 --> 00:23:51,596
Speaker 1: I don't know either.

468
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,949
Speaker 1: We had it in Beacon I think.

469
00:23:53,650 --> 00:23:56,350
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah we did but it didn't work that well.

470
00:23:56,612 --> 00:24:00,550
Speaker 0: Remember we also had that ghetto DVD player that we had to take the case off or it would overheat?

471
00:24:01,153 --> 00:24:04,249
Speaker 0: That we hacked to be region free and then never played a single region free disc ever?

472
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:09,368
Speaker 1: Yeah, well because we had Video Barn which had broken with the discs were hacked so it didn't matter.

473
00:24:10,553 --> 00:24:11,483
Speaker 0: So Scott was like, "What should I

474
00:24:11,524 --> 00:24:11,847
Speaker 0: watch?".

475
00:24:12,393 --> 00:24:23,670
Speaker 0: and after a long sort of explanation of Sailor Moon R, S, Super S, stars, manga, movies I realized that there's no way I'll ever get Scott to watch all of Sailor Moon.

476
00:24:23,791 --> 00:24:24,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, no kidding.

477
00:24:25,993 --> 00:24:35,609
Speaker 0: And the thing is I'd love to get him to watch enough to do a show on Sailor Moon the way we did on Slayers but it's not going to happen anytime soon.

478
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,123
Speaker 0: It's too much.

479
00:24:37,224 --> 00:24:38,396
Speaker 0: It's only 200 episodes.

480
00:24:38,881 --> 00:24:39,930
Speaker 1: Oh, only 200.

481
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:41,650
Speaker 1: It's only more than Fist of the North Star.

482
00:24:42,291 --> 00:24:42,808
Speaker 0: That's all.

483
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:47,550
Speaker 0: So rather than explain it or anything I figured let's just pick a movie.

484
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:51,229
Speaker 0: So I took the three movies and I didn't really explain what they were.

485
00:24:51,512 --> 00:24:53,150
Speaker 0: I just offered Scott the following choice.

486
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,089
Speaker 0: Do you want to watch the movie about the gay guy from space who comes down and fucks shit up?

487
00:24:57,710 --> 00:24:58,641
Speaker 0: The movie about candy?

488
00:24:58,661 --> 00:25:01,110
Speaker 0: Or the movie that's actually about the cat and the moon?

489
00:25:01,591 --> 00:25:02,970
Speaker 1: Well, I don't care about the cat and the moon.

490
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:04,643
Speaker 0: That's actually the best one.

491
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:06,481
Speaker 1: Well the other one sounds crazy, right?

492
00:25:06,521 --> 00:25:08,016
Speaker 1: So it's got to be one of the crazy ones.

493
00:25:08,036 --> 00:25:08,542
Speaker 1: Right?

494
00:25:09,750 --> 00:25:11,106
Speaker 1: So, I don't know.

495
00:25:11,126 --> 00:25:12,238
Speaker 1: We ended up with the candy one.

496
00:25:12,642 --> 00:25:13,896
Speaker 1: But it wasn't about candy.

497
00:25:13,916 --> 00:25:14,990
Speaker 1: It was about Pedobear.

498
00:25:15,711 --> 00:25:16,830
Speaker 0: No, it was about the Pedo Piper.

499
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:18,341
Speaker 1: It was about Pedobear.

500
00:25:18,744 --> 00:25:20,784
Speaker 0: We're going to spoil the Sailor Moon Super-S movie.

501
00:25:20,824 --> 00:25:23,608
Speaker 0: You don't really You don't give a shit about that.

502
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,368
Speaker 0: You should probably watch the movie.

503
00:25:26,757 --> 00:25:27,753
Speaker 1: No, you probably shouldn't.

504
00:25:28,258 --> 00:25:35,552
Speaker 0: So I learned some stuff about this movie because when I watched Sailor Moon you know, Young and Innocent I did not know yet who Kunihiko Ikuhara was.

505
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,346
Speaker 0: Ikuhara, you know, Utena Craziness Pedophile.

506
00:25:43,614 --> 00:25:44,280
Speaker 0: Not a pedophile.

507
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,019
Speaker 0: More of a hebophile as far as we can tell.

508
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:46,730
Speaker 0: He would at least.

509
00:25:46,893 --> 00:25:47,850
Speaker 1: Oh, because that's so much better.

510
00:25:48,472 --> 00:25:50,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's arguably a little bit better.

511
00:25:50,892 --> 00:25:51,215
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

512
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:55,722
Speaker 0: I'm not going to impinge upon his character because some of it's second hand.

513
00:25:56,025 --> 00:25:58,730
Speaker 0: Some of it's just obvious from listening to him in interviews.

514
00:25:59,555 --> 00:26:03,909
Speaker 0: He's an odd dude but he caused Utena to be made so I got to give him some respect.

515
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:07,870
Speaker 0: But he was, you know, also deeply involved in Sailor Moon.

516
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:22,409
Speaker 0: And apparently the Sailor Moon Super-S movie was originally going to be primarily about sailors Uranus and Neptune and have a basically totally different plot all about them.

517
00:26:23,496 --> 00:26:26,269
Speaker 0: And he left the series before that got made.

518
00:26:26,593 --> 00:26:27,828
Speaker 0: so they just dropped it all.

519
00:26:28,911 --> 00:26:30,974
Speaker 0: So this was not the movie that could've been.

520
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:37,648
Speaker 0: I'm almost sad about that because Uranus and Neptune are pretty much the best characters in the show.

521
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:41,238
Speaker 0: Let's talk about this movie.

522
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:42,330
Speaker 1: So here's how this movie goes.

523
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:55,630
Speaker 1: So you're sitting in this town, happy town, and suddenly this is, you know, Pied Piper but he's a Pied Piper of children bringing the children into his magical flying boat with promises of candy.

524
00:26:56,330 --> 00:26:57,845
Speaker 1: Pedo bear, pedo bear, pedo bear.

525
00:26:57,906 --> 00:26:59,829
Speaker 1: How can you not see the pedo?

526
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,729
Speaker 1: He brings a whole town's full of children into his flying candy arc.

527
00:27:04,671 --> 00:27:05,359
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

528
00:27:05,379 --> 00:27:07,118
Speaker 1: That's really what the movie's about.

529
00:27:07,179 --> 00:27:08,189
Speaker 1: That's the central plot.

530
00:27:09,635 --> 00:27:12,916
Speaker 1: Of course, Sailor Moon and friends wake up to try and fight this shit.

531
00:27:13,866 --> 00:27:14,916
Speaker 1: Well, not originally.

532
00:27:15,017 --> 00:27:16,249
Speaker 0: A whole bunch of kids get abducted.

533
00:27:16,490 --> 00:27:17,541
Speaker 1: Well, in all their towns.

534
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:18,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, all over the world.

535
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,762
Speaker 1: Like, thousands of kids.

536
00:27:19,802 --> 00:27:22,774
Speaker 1: That's until they try to kidnap from the sailor town where the sailors live.

537
00:27:23,218 --> 00:27:24,107
Speaker 0: So immediately I realized...

538
00:27:24,127 --> 00:27:27,744
Speaker 1: The thing is, if they're supposed to be protecting the whole solar system they can't even protect...

539
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:28,290
Speaker 0: No, no they're not.

540
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:31,560
Speaker 1: They can't even protect the other towns on Earth.

541
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,215
Speaker 1: They can only protect their own town.

542
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:34,649
Speaker 1: What the fuck is up with that?

543
00:27:35,171 --> 00:27:40,229
Speaker 0: Shortly in the movie, the first thing Scott asked me is, "How come none of these Sailor Scouts are competent at all?

544
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:41,097
Speaker 0: Are any of them

545
00:27:41,238 --> 00:27:41,602
Speaker 0: smart?".

546
00:27:42,290 --> 00:27:44,266
Speaker 0: And that's pretty much when the Outer Senshi...

547
00:27:44,690 --> 00:27:50,996
Speaker 1: Even the computery one with the cool goggles and stuff was stupid.

548
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:59,259
Speaker 1: It's like, they're sitting there, there's a bad guy and they're yelling at him and saying stuff and they're fighting the same minions over and over again.

549
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,976
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Just use all of your Sailor magical attacks at

550
00:28:03,158 --> 00:28:03,300
Speaker 1: once!".

551
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,716
Speaker 0: But Scott, it is the deepest insult to Japanese culture.

552
00:28:06,776 --> 00:28:11,280
Speaker 0: you could ever have to use your full power immediately or at any point until the last possible second.

553
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:15,988
Speaker 1: You obviously need to use your full power because children are getting abducted probably for raping.

554
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:18,290
Speaker 0: I love how they don't even put much of an effort.

555
00:28:18,510 --> 00:28:25,608
Speaker 0: They see these massive kids walking toward this scary ark and they kind of stand in front of the kids like, "Hey, eh, don't go.

556
00:28:26,131 --> 00:28:26,901
Speaker 0: Eh, fuck it, let him

557
00:28:26,942 --> 00:28:27,104
Speaker 0: go.".

558
00:28:28,094 --> 00:28:30,270
Speaker 1: Not really all that much happens in this movie.

559
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:40,998
Speaker 1: It's really, the amount of stuff that happens in this movie is about the same amount of stuff that would happen in a TV episode is just sort of dragged out with like, the pace is kind of slow.

560
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:42,473
Speaker 0: Welcome to the Sailor Moon movies.

561
00:28:42,493 --> 00:28:50,899
Speaker 1: There's a lot of useless talking that doesn't advance the plot and a lot of scenes where it's like, there'll be these blue bad guys falling down at them and they'll attack them and it'll work.

562
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:53,930
Speaker 0: Apparently those blue candy bomb bomb bomb babies!

563
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:02,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, the bomb bomb babies will attack, they'll fight them off and then more will come and they'll fight them off and they'll kill like ten minutes just fighting bomb bomb babies.

564
00:29:02,775 --> 00:29:03,890
Speaker 1: eh, you know, fruitlessly.

565
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:12,630
Speaker 0: Which apparently in this intergalactic like, fairy space civilization bomb bomb babies are actually the only weapon they have.

566
00:29:13,030 --> 00:29:13,294
Speaker 1: Yeah.

567
00:29:13,436 --> 00:29:17,339
Speaker 0: I mean even the cannon seems to shoot like, weaponized bomb bomb babies.

568
00:29:17,824 --> 00:29:18,450
Speaker 1: It's very strange.

569
00:29:19,372 --> 00:29:25,399
Speaker 0: I do also like how the intersenshi, the main Sailor Scouts pretty much fall for any trick.

570
00:29:25,904 --> 00:29:32,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're just dumb, they don't... They're fighting a candy monster that tricked children with promises of candy and then they got a scary ride boat.

571
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:36,329
Speaker 1: And then the guy uses gingerbread house to fool them and it kinda works.

572
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:44,130
Speaker 0: They're like, we're gonna stop you from tricking people with candy, oh hey look a gingerbread house, hey how come we're all babies now, who the fuck cares, candy!

573
00:29:44,992 --> 00:29:48,630
Speaker 1: It's like, oh my god you have magical attacking powers.

574
00:29:49,156 --> 00:29:58,410
Speaker 1: you just fucking transformed in a crazy transforming scene, use your super magical attack and defeat the bad guy, no we're just gonna stand here and get hit by bomb bomb babies.

575
00:29:58,471 --> 00:30:12,550
Speaker 0: What was more interesting is Chibi-Usa, you know the pink one, the little girl, is you know, she has this whole like, mechanon like childish, innocent romance with petal du du du, who's I guess the main good side character.

576
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:16,852
Speaker 1: Right, there's like, you know, there's the three petal kidnappers, but then there's one person who's...

577
00:30:16,872 --> 00:30:18,330
Speaker 0: Well, the petal kidnappers.

578
00:30:18,835 --> 00:30:21,055
Speaker 0: one of them, Populin, is kinda normal.

579
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,461
Speaker 1: Then there's like these two other ones that appear...

580
00:30:23,502 --> 00:30:24,513
Speaker 0: Banana and Orangin?

581
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:28,109
Speaker 1: Banana and Orangin, which I looked at and I was like, oh my god, banana guy and orange guy.

582
00:30:28,291 --> 00:30:28,735
Speaker 1: oh my god.

583
00:30:28,917 --> 00:30:29,563
Speaker 0: I like the orange guy a lot.

584
00:30:29,584 --> 00:30:30,999
Speaker 1: They're in the movie for like a minute.

585
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:32,030
Speaker 1: They're hilarious though.

586
00:30:32,471 --> 00:30:37,824
Speaker 1: They don't really say anything too much but they appear, and it's like, oh my god They pretty much go down like jumps.

587
00:30:37,864 --> 00:30:38,429
Speaker 0: They're hilarious.

588
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:40,048
Speaker 0: Oh, don't forget Queen Badine.

589
00:30:40,291 --> 00:30:46,430
Speaker 1: Right, so that's basically it, the chief pedophile who is like, you know, cause there always has to be a square boss behind the regular bad guy.

590
00:30:46,591 --> 00:30:47,239
Speaker 0: Of course.

591
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,643
Speaker 1: Right.

592
00:30:48,068 --> 00:30:56,370
Speaker 0: But you know, the pink haired one is kind of like like it's obvious she has this weird crush on, you know, Mamoru, sailor not sailor, Tuxedo Mask.

593
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,549
Speaker 0: I keep, I always wanted like.

594
00:30:58,973 --> 00:31:01,580
Speaker 0: I'm never sure if I should say the English name or the Japanese, whatever.

595
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,189
Speaker 0: And Scott points that out.

596
00:31:04,855 --> 00:31:20,024
Speaker 0: and then I realize suddenly something that I never noticed when I watched the show the first time how fucked up that is because Scott was bothered by it not knowing that that girl is actually his daughter from the future and everyone involved knows that.

597
00:31:20,105 --> 00:31:24,082
Speaker 1: I mean the fact that that's even what this plot is, is crazy.

598
00:31:24,102 --> 00:31:25,920
Speaker 1: That's like something fans would come up in a fanfiction.

599
00:31:25,940 --> 00:31:26,850
Speaker 1: I know it's amazing Scott.

600
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:35,638
Speaker 1: The fact that that little chibi thing even exists is like she's totally seems like the kind of thing that would only exist in fanfiction and would never actually be in a show.

601
00:31:35,658 --> 00:31:47,559
Speaker 1: So it's like maybe that's actually sort of in some ways that and maybe other shows that have similar things are responsible maybe for the crazy shit in fanfiction because sometimes that shit happens in the actual canon.

602
00:31:47,599 --> 00:31:48,488
Speaker 1: It's like are you kidding me?

603
00:31:49,050 --> 00:31:49,816
Speaker 0: Are you kidding me?

604
00:31:49,837 --> 00:31:50,945
Speaker 1: This taught me something.

605
00:31:52,292 --> 00:31:59,175
Speaker 1: There's some tiny Sailor Moon with pink hair from the future who's like three years old and is the daughter of Sailor Moon.

606
00:31:59,195 --> 00:32:00,470
Speaker 0: She's like six or seven or eight.

607
00:32:00,510 --> 00:32:01,440
Speaker 1: Fine, she's six, seven or eight.

608
00:32:01,561 --> 00:32:05,950
Speaker 1: She's from the Sailor Moon's daughter from the future who went back in time.

609
00:32:06,510 --> 00:32:09,721
Speaker 0: The one who's three is called Chibi Chibi and is even smaller.

610
00:32:09,762 --> 00:32:10,790
Speaker 1: That's double fanfiction.

611
00:32:11,050 --> 00:32:12,810
Speaker 0: But no, she's actually the goddess of the universe.

612
00:32:13,310 --> 00:32:14,190
Speaker 0: Spoilers I guess.

613
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:16,209
Speaker 1: That is fucked up shit right there.

614
00:32:16,670 --> 00:32:17,810
Speaker 1: That is fanfiction.

615
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:18,860
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

616
00:32:19,082 --> 00:32:25,145
Speaker 0: What I realized and this is like a revelation because I happen to have seen all of Sailor Moon from an earlier Desperate Arrow.

617
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:26,661
Speaker 1: You just happened to have seen it.

618
00:32:26,883 --> 00:32:27,328
Speaker 1: You didn't.

619
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:30,089
Speaker 1: You went out of your way to see.

620
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:30,789
Speaker 1: it is the truth.

621
00:32:31,911 --> 00:32:34,456
Speaker 1: It's not like you were sitting in a room and it just happened to be gone.

622
00:32:34,476 --> 00:32:43,590
Speaker 0: I just happened to scour the internet find a guy, call him on the phone get him to give me an address where I could mail him VHS tapes and he would then send me fan subs of a show from Japan.

623
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:45,060
Speaker 0: I just happened to do that.

624
00:32:45,384 --> 00:32:47,325
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just happened to do that.

625
00:32:47,365 --> 00:32:53,929
Speaker 0: This was an era when I had seen literally every piece of anime I could get my grubby little meat hooks on.

626
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:54,354
Speaker 1: That's right.

627
00:32:54,537 --> 00:32:56,358
Speaker 0: I would have watched anything.

628
00:32:56,398 --> 00:32:58,228
Speaker 0: In fact, I watched some shit.

629
00:32:59,670 --> 00:33:01,469
Speaker 0: I watched Armageddon more than once.

630
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:01,976
Speaker 0: No.

631
00:33:02,991 --> 00:33:05,310
Speaker 0: Doom Megalopolis, Wind of Amnesia.

632
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:16,090
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I'm going to say right now that Sailor Moon, the expanded universe is basically Green Lantern, manga style.

633
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:19,683
Speaker 1: I think it might even be worse even though I hesitate to say that anything could be worse.

634
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:23,242
Speaker 1: It's equal at best.

635
00:33:23,383 --> 00:33:30,476
Speaker 0: Watching this movie which should be relatively like, alright Sailor Moon, you kind of know they have magical powers based on the planets and they fight crime.

636
00:33:30,517 --> 00:33:31,329
Speaker 0: You can deal with this.

637
00:33:32,674 --> 00:33:43,529
Speaker 0: Every question Scott would ask I would start to answer and realize that there was no way to answer that would make any sense to anyone who had not seen all the rest of this bullshit.

638
00:33:44,016 --> 00:33:45,050
Speaker 0: It's got to be like, who's that one?

639
00:33:45,573 --> 00:33:50,054
Speaker 0: Well, so that's the daughter of Sailor Moon and the tuxedo guy from the future.

640
00:33:50,095 --> 00:33:51,570
Speaker 0: when they re-found the empire.

641
00:33:52,973 --> 00:33:53,770
Speaker 1: but... What empire?

642
00:33:53,910 --> 00:33:56,236
Speaker 1: These are like high school girls who live in some town.

643
00:33:56,256 --> 00:34:04,530
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, because in the past before the show started there was another empire that collapsed and all those sailors are the reincarnated people from that empire.

644
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:10,270
Speaker 0: And there was no way to answer any questions Scott had about this show basically.

645
00:34:11,992 --> 00:34:12,422
Speaker 1: Keep going.

646
00:34:13,210 --> 00:34:19,121
Speaker 0: But the best part was that at the peak of all the bomb bomb babies are kicking their asses in a tuxedo mask.

647
00:34:19,746 --> 00:34:22,350
Speaker 0: who is still to this day one of those ridiculous characters.

648
00:34:22,451 --> 00:34:24,047
Speaker 1: I don't understand this guy.

649
00:34:24,068 --> 00:34:26,855
Speaker 1: They have these people with magical powers and they're failing.

650
00:34:27,077 --> 00:34:29,078
Speaker 1: So this guy with no magical powers whatsoever.

651
00:34:29,098 --> 00:34:32,329
Speaker 1: It was just a human wearing a tuxedo, a top hat and a mask on his face.

652
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:36,027
Speaker 0: He can throw a rose and he can hit you with his little cane.

653
00:34:36,389 --> 00:34:38,389
Speaker 1: He throws roses and he's just a dude.

654
00:34:39,054 --> 00:34:44,489
Speaker 1: he comes in and he actually tries to think he can help out the magical people who are failing.

655
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:46,309
Speaker 1: That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

656
00:34:46,989 --> 00:34:54,126
Speaker 1: But at least, it's even dumber than Batman trying to help Superman, but at least he gets friggin' sent to the hospital.

657
00:34:54,166 --> 00:34:54,914
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

658
00:34:54,954 --> 00:34:55,702
Speaker 1: I was glad for that.

659
00:34:55,722 --> 00:34:59,579
Speaker 1: Because it's like yeah, normal guy can't do shit and he gets sent to the hospital.

660
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:04,510
Speaker 0: So he does actually get powers and become a space knight at one point, but that stops happening.

661
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:15,679
Speaker 0: Anyway, part of it too is that a lot of the weird things that happen in this movie and all the Sailor Moon movies, and they're all only an hour long, are basically like shout outs.

662
00:35:15,739 --> 00:35:16,124
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was.

663
00:35:16,144 --> 00:35:17,883
Speaker 1: the saving grace of this movie is that it was short.

664
00:35:17,923 --> 00:35:20,730
Speaker 0: They're shout outs and are callbacks to tropes of the show.

665
00:35:21,351 --> 00:35:26,589
Speaker 0: A trope of the show, especially early on, was Sailor Moon can't do shit and doesn't know what to do.

666
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:29,276
Speaker 0: And then Tuxedo Mask appears and says, "Sailor Moon, use your

667
00:35:29,317 --> 00:35:29,721
Speaker 0: powers!".

668
00:35:29,741 --> 00:35:30,974
Speaker 0: She's like, "Oh right, she uses her

669
00:35:30,994 --> 00:35:31,256
Speaker 0: powers.".

670
00:35:31,418 --> 00:35:33,298
Speaker 0: Oh right, I have magic.

671
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:34,249
Speaker 1: That's how I transform.

672
00:35:34,451 --> 00:35:36,430
Speaker 1: Maybe I should use that on the bad guy.

673
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:39,702
Speaker 0: Her first power is to take her little tiara off and throw it at someone.

674
00:35:39,722 --> 00:35:40,855
Speaker 0: Just keep doing that!

675
00:35:40,916 --> 00:35:41,870
Speaker 0: They turn to dust!

676
00:35:42,310 --> 00:35:43,830
Speaker 0: They die immediately.

677
00:35:44,110 --> 00:35:47,764
Speaker 1: I was like, why didn't she just throw that tiara at the big queen, whatever she was?

678
00:35:47,784 --> 00:35:48,430
Speaker 0: Nah, I can't.

679
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:49,448
Speaker 0: You can't use your full power.

680
00:35:50,475 --> 00:35:52,130
Speaker 1: You used it on the bonbon babies!

681
00:35:52,711 --> 00:35:53,929
Speaker 1: You can't use it on the big baws?

682
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:59,399
Speaker 1: If I had a tiara that turned people to dust, I'd just be throwing it all the time at any bad guys.

683
00:35:59,621 --> 00:36:00,935
Speaker 1: But not good guys, like X-Cop.

684
00:36:01,137 --> 00:36:05,098
Speaker 0: But Sailor says she is completely incompetent through this whole situation.

685
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:08,310
Speaker 1: And then, later in the show, these other Sailors show up.

686
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:08,917
Speaker 1: The extra Sailors.

687
00:36:08,937 --> 00:36:09,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott's like, "Is anyone

688
00:36:09,911 --> 00:36:10,355
Speaker 0: competent?".

689
00:36:10,416 --> 00:36:11,506
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Actually, yes.

690
00:36:11,607 --> 00:36:11,950
Speaker 0: The outer

691
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:12,454
Speaker 0: sentient.".

692
00:36:12,475 --> 00:36:14,634
Speaker 0: Then they show up, and they're like, "What the fuck is up?

693
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:15,321
Speaker 0: I got a sword!

694
00:36:15,402 --> 00:36:15,826
Speaker 0: Let's kick some

695
00:36:15,988 --> 00:36:16,129
Speaker 0: ass!".

696
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,402
Speaker 1: Yeah, they show up, and they're like, "Aw

697
00:36:17,603 --> 00:36:17,826
Speaker 1: shit.".

698
00:36:17,866 --> 00:36:19,360
Speaker 1: They actually use their magic powers.

699
00:36:19,381 --> 00:36:19,966
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Fuck

700
00:36:19,986 --> 00:36:20,209
Speaker 1: yeah.".

701
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:27,489
Speaker 0: Now, again, I had to explain that their job, Green Lantern Universe, is to defend the solar system from external threats.

702
00:36:28,172 --> 00:36:29,019
Speaker 0: They're not supposed to get involved.

703
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:29,785
Speaker 1: Then why do they show up?

704
00:36:29,805 --> 00:36:31,361
Speaker 1: to get involved with Candy Prawn?

705
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:40,589
Speaker 0: And I realized the only argument I had here, this is some Radio Free Equestria Gandalf girthing, is that they showed up because the plot is basically

706
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:42,566
Speaker 1: Sailor-esque

707
00:36:43,073 --> 00:36:54,490
Speaker 0: alien comes down with technology and forces the fairies, the candy fairies, of planet Earth to help her steal children so she can have wonderful dreams with them in her black dream hole.

708
00:36:54,930 --> 00:36:55,173
Speaker 1: Yeah.

709
00:36:56,248 --> 00:37:01,159
Speaker 0: And because this happened, the Outer Senji were like, "Oh shit, we let one through.

710
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,917
Speaker 0: We better go clean that up before we get in

711
00:37:02,937 --> 00:37:03,280
Speaker 0: trouble.".

712
00:37:04,271 --> 00:37:06,269
Speaker 0: Also, the Inner Senji can't deal with this shit.

713
00:37:07,151 --> 00:37:09,850
Speaker 0: The Green Lantern on Earth can't deal with the Galactus whatevers.

714
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:10,716
Speaker 1: It is a thing, right?

715
00:37:10,756 --> 00:37:16,110
Speaker 1: Those Outer Senji, whatever, they were way confident and way stronger powers, and they looked older and cooler.

716
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,442
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're in high school.

717
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:19,850
Speaker 1: And they actually didn't hesitate to use- they look like college.

718
00:37:20,551 --> 00:37:24,210
Speaker 1: I guess like the Sailor Moon, it's weird, it's like the opposite of current animes.

719
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,552
Speaker 1: Current animes, it's like, "What is she in?

720
00:37:26,572 --> 00:37:27,178
Speaker 1: She's in high school.

721
00:37:27,198 --> 00:37:27,803
Speaker 1: She looks like she's

722
00:37:27,844 --> 00:37:27,965
Speaker 1: two.".

723
00:37:28,590 --> 00:37:33,103
Speaker 1: But now it's like, "Well, those middle school girls look like high school girls, and the high school girls look like college

724
00:37:33,123 --> 00:37:33,367
Speaker 1: girls.".

725
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:39,750
Speaker 1: But do those outer ones, do they live on the outer planets, like Pluto, or do they actually go to school somewhere on Earth?

726
00:37:39,951 --> 00:37:46,350
Speaker 0: So, it's complicated, depending on what era of Sailor Moon we're in, but yeah, the two- Do they live on Titan or Europa or something?

727
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:49,530
Speaker 0: So, Haruka and Michiru, Ernest and Neptune, they actually- The lesbians?

728
00:37:50,172 --> 00:37:50,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, the lesbians.

729
00:37:50,778 --> 00:37:51,869
Speaker 0: They went to a high school.

730
00:37:53,814 --> 00:37:56,250
Speaker 0: There's stuff with that high school that tried to destroy the world.

731
00:37:56,791 --> 00:37:56,953
Speaker 0: Great.

732
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:58,670
Speaker 1: It's a pedo high school.

733
00:37:59,090 --> 00:38:03,950
Speaker 0: No, when the Holy Grail came, and they had to stop Pharaoh from destroying the world with the Holy Grail.

734
00:38:03,970 --> 00:38:05,186
Speaker 0: Wait, King Arthur's Holy Grail?

735
00:38:05,307 --> 00:38:05,449
Speaker 1: Yeah.

736
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:07,609
Speaker 1: But the Pharaoh Ramses wanted the Holy Grail?

737
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:11,730
Speaker 0: No, basically the Pharaoh is the same as the villain from The Fifth Element.

738
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:12,811
Speaker 1: Oh.

739
00:38:12,932 --> 00:38:17,134
Speaker 0: Like, actually, to the point that when I saw The Fifth Element- Stargate?

740
00:38:17,559 --> 00:38:18,753
Speaker 0: No, more like Fifth Element.

741
00:38:18,814 --> 00:38:19,116
Speaker 0: Okay.

742
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:21,338
Speaker 1: When I saw The Fifth Element- Ruby Rodd?

743
00:38:21,358 --> 00:38:24,934
Speaker 0: I remember literally thinking, "Wow, did they steal this from Sailor

744
00:38:24,974 --> 00:38:25,177
Speaker 0: Moon?".

745
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:25,948
Speaker 1: What the fuck?

746
00:38:26,512 --> 00:38:29,096
Speaker 0: Like, it's so the same thing.

747
00:38:29,399 --> 00:38:29,844
Speaker 1: Anyway.

748
00:38:29,945 --> 00:38:30,370
Speaker 1: Ruby Rodd.

749
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:33,539
Speaker 1: But they showed up, and they're all confident, but they didn't actually get the job done.

750
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:38,164
Speaker 1: They just sort of picked off the Bon-Bon babies and stuff, and- Well, they picked them off.

751
00:38:38,185 --> 00:38:40,310
Speaker 1: Sailor Moon had to actually get the real job done.

752
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:45,539
Speaker 0: So, there's a trope to the Sailor Moon movies of Sailor Moon, you know, everyone's failed.

753
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,370
Speaker 1: But Sailor Moon is way less powerful and way less dumb.

754
00:38:48,530 --> 00:38:50,359
Speaker 0: She is, in fact, the most powerful.

755
00:38:50,379 --> 00:38:50,560
Speaker 1: Then why?

756
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,694
Speaker 0: the powers are weird and different, and it's complicated.

757
00:38:54,714 --> 00:38:55,300
Speaker 1: Just use them.

758
00:38:55,321 --> 00:38:56,190
Speaker 1: You've used them before.

759
00:38:56,370 --> 00:38:57,547
Speaker 0: This isn't the first movie, right?

760
00:38:57,587 --> 00:38:57,648
Speaker 1: No.

761
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:57,750
Speaker 1: So.

762
00:38:58,051 --> 00:39:00,754
Speaker 1: It's not movie one, which means you've used the power before.

763
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:03,015
Speaker 1: Use whatever you used before, right?

764
00:39:03,197 --> 00:39:04,834
Speaker 1: Fist of the North Star doesn't get this wrong.

765
00:39:05,096 --> 00:39:06,428
Speaker 1: He learns Musou Tensei.

766
00:39:06,772 --> 00:39:08,389
Speaker 1: He uses Musou Tensei.

767
00:39:08,611 --> 00:39:10,066
Speaker 1: He doesn't forget it, right?

768
00:39:10,106 --> 00:39:11,682
Speaker 1: When he needs to use it, he whips it out.

769
00:39:11,743 --> 00:39:16,550
Speaker 0: So, in the show, every half-season or so, she learns a new power, like, levels up.

770
00:39:16,590 --> 00:39:17,661
Speaker 0: They all learn new powers.

771
00:39:17,762 --> 00:39:18,005
Speaker 0: Cool.

772
00:39:18,065 --> 00:39:20,090
Speaker 1: How many powers did they know by the time this episode?

773
00:39:20,292 --> 00:39:24,230
Speaker 0: So, you notice how all the individual sailors kept using, like, different powers that was based on?

774
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,128
Speaker 1: They didn't really have that many of them, but they used three or four each.

775
00:39:28,611 --> 00:39:33,243
Speaker 1: And the thing that really bothered me is, like, they whipped out, like, all these sword handles that didn't have swords on them.

776
00:39:33,607 --> 00:39:37,950
Speaker 1: So, they transformed, but then they didn't actually even have the handles afterwards.

777
00:39:38,170 --> 00:39:41,729
Speaker 1: And I'm like, you have this tool used in your transformation sequence, and where'd the tool go?

778
00:39:42,090 --> 00:39:47,041
Speaker 1: But then the better ones showed up, and they actually had, like, swords and staves, and they actually used them.

779
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:48,676
Speaker 0: Well, because they're the badasses.

780
00:39:48,717 --> 00:39:50,474
Speaker 0: Pluto is one of the baddest asses there is.

781
00:39:50,514 --> 00:39:56,049
Speaker 1: Right, why didn't the badasses get the whole job done, and why didn't Sailor Moon just go back home and take care of the frickin' tuxedo guy?

782
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,628
Speaker 0: Who's in the hospital?

783
00:39:58,090 --> 00:40:01,868
Speaker 0: Sailor Saturn's power is destroy all of existence right the fuck.

784
00:40:01,908 --> 00:40:03,140
Speaker 0: now, the end of everything.

785
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,646
Speaker 1: Alright, so you should stay home, because that power's useless.

786
00:40:05,686 --> 00:40:05,848
Speaker 1: Yeah.

787
00:40:07,132 --> 00:40:10,050
Speaker 1: In fact, why didn't the other sailors just fucking kill Sailor Saturn?

788
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:10,918
Speaker 1: That doesn't ever happen.

789
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,778
Speaker 0: Uh, that's actually the plot of Sailor--.

790
00:40:12,798 --> 00:40:15,829
Speaker 1: 'Cause somebody is just gonna, like, possess Sailor Saturn and make that happen.

791
00:40:16,111 --> 00:40:18,569
Speaker 0: So, Scott, that's pretty much the plot of Sailor Moon S.

792
00:40:18,770 --> 00:40:19,870
Speaker 1: Oh, at least that's not so dumb.

793
00:40:20,090 --> 00:40:25,269
Speaker 0: She's a girl, and, you know, all the sense-- Is she some, like, high school girl who's dumb?

794
00:40:25,811 --> 00:40:29,085
Speaker 0: Uh, no, she's actually eerily, like, scarily smart and weird.

795
00:40:29,105 --> 00:40:29,430
Speaker 0: Well, that's good.

796
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:38,417
Speaker 0: And she knows what's up, and her dad's a scientist, and that's actually-- If you're ever gonna watch Sailor Moon, Sailor Moon S is probably the best one to watch.

797
00:40:38,437 --> 00:40:39,530
Speaker 1: So that's not what we watched?

798
00:40:39,671 --> 00:40:41,244
Speaker 0: No, Sailor Moon S, the show.

799
00:40:41,305 --> 00:40:42,986
Speaker 1: So we watched Super S, the movie.

800
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:43,209
Speaker 1: The movie.

801
00:40:43,473 --> 00:40:44,409
Speaker 1: What's super about it?

802
00:40:45,831 --> 00:40:51,694
Speaker 1: It's just Super S, as opposed to S, and I-- Is there a Super S TV show?

803
00:40:51,957 --> 00:40:56,082
Speaker 0: Yes, the TV shows go Sailor Moon, then there's that Alan and Anne bullshit.

804
00:40:56,284 --> 00:40:56,810
Speaker 1: What's that?

805
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,310
Speaker 0: Just, like, between that and Sailor Moon R.

806
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:00,847
Speaker 1: Is it an OAV or a TV or a movie?

807
00:41:00,867 --> 00:41:03,755
Speaker 0: It's like just the next season after the first Queen Beryl thing ends.

808
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:04,200
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

809
00:41:04,220 --> 00:41:13,390
Speaker 0: So there's the Queen Beryl arc, then there's the Alan and Anne arc, and then what is colloquial known as Sailor Moon R, which is arguably Alan and Anne and the next thing with Prince Diamond.

810
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:19,249
Speaker 0: Then there's Sailor Moon S, which is about the Holy Grail, Pharaoh, Saturn destroying the universe.

811
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,443
Speaker 1: So that's all the epic stuff?

812
00:41:20,484 --> 00:41:21,010
Speaker 1: That's the epic stuff.

813
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,442
Speaker 1: That's why you want people to watch that one?

814
00:41:22,463 --> 00:41:23,593
Speaker 0: Super S is Pegasus--.

815
00:41:23,613 --> 00:41:24,704
Speaker 1: So that has all the cosmic stuff?

816
00:41:24,805 --> 00:41:26,890
Speaker 0: Super S is Pegasus and candy and bullshit.

817
00:41:27,734 --> 00:41:28,786
Speaker 1: The TV show and the movie?

818
00:41:28,927 --> 00:41:29,110
Speaker 1: Yes.

819
00:41:29,613 --> 00:41:32,384
Speaker 0: But different Pegasuses and different bullshit and different candy.

820
00:41:32,546 --> 00:41:32,810
Speaker 1: Okay.

821
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:40,210
Speaker 0: And Sailor Stars is the girls who turn into guys who come from, it's like super galactic.

822
00:41:41,693 --> 00:41:42,746
Speaker 0: Andromeda.

823
00:41:42,847 --> 00:41:43,030
Speaker 1: Yes.

824
00:41:43,290 --> 00:41:51,978
Speaker 0: Sailor S is like the Green Lantern expanded universe, then Super S is like, I don't even know.

825
00:41:51,998 --> 00:41:52,670
Speaker 1: You mean stars.

826
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:53,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, stars.

827
00:41:53,736 --> 00:41:56,484
Speaker 0: Stars is like the next step out.

828
00:41:56,665 --> 00:41:58,350
Speaker 1: So then what's the end of Sailor Moon?

829
00:41:59,634 --> 00:42:00,102
Speaker 0: Stars.

830
00:42:00,122 --> 00:42:00,386
Speaker 0: Is it?

831
00:42:01,031 --> 00:42:03,836
Speaker 0: So stars basically is like--.

832
00:42:03,856 --> 00:42:05,936
Speaker 1: So each of these things is a TV show and a movie?

833
00:42:05,997 --> 00:42:06,300
Speaker 1: Are there OAVs?

834
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,250
Speaker 0: There's no stars movie.

835
00:42:07,633 --> 00:42:08,501
Speaker 0: Oh, okay.

836
00:42:08,542 --> 00:42:10,702
Speaker 1: But every other thing is a TV show and a movie?

837
00:42:11,005 --> 00:42:12,682
Speaker 0: Yes, and the movies have nothing to do with the show.

838
00:42:12,702 --> 00:42:14,887
Speaker 1: So like there's an R TV series and an R movie?

839
00:42:14,988 --> 00:42:17,167
Speaker 0: Yes, the R movie is the gay guy from space who ruins every movie.

840
00:42:17,187 --> 00:42:19,006
Speaker 1: And the movie comes after each TV series?

841
00:42:19,046 --> 00:42:21,530
Speaker 0: The movie does not make sense or fit into the continuity at all.

842
00:42:22,032 --> 00:42:22,665
Speaker 1: None of the movies?

843
00:42:22,726 --> 00:42:22,910
Speaker 0: Nope.

844
00:42:23,351 --> 00:42:24,562
Speaker 0: They're like the comic book movie.

845
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:25,895
Speaker 1: Were these movies in theaters?

846
00:42:26,805 --> 00:42:28,363
Speaker 0: As far as I can tell, they were.

847
00:42:28,545 --> 00:42:28,848
Speaker 0: Whoa.

848
00:42:29,090 --> 00:42:30,122
Speaker 1: They're like Pokemon movies.

849
00:42:30,365 --> 00:42:30,467
Speaker 0: Yes.

850
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:32,221
Speaker 1: As far as I can tell.

851
00:42:32,241 --> 00:42:32,808
Speaker 1: Or One Piece movies.

852
00:42:35,997 --> 00:42:45,578
Speaker 0: So another trope of a Sailor Moon movie is that everyone fails and then there's an impossible situation like we're all gonna die or you can't stop this.

853
00:42:45,639 --> 00:42:48,063
Speaker 0: You can't get out of a black dream hole once you crawl into it.

854
00:42:48,528 --> 00:42:50,463
Speaker 0: And then Sailor Moon will say, "I have to try

855
00:42:50,483 --> 00:42:50,705
Speaker 0: anyway!".

856
00:42:51,594 --> 00:42:52,449
Speaker 0: And then she dies.

857
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:53,255
Speaker 0: Or something.

858
00:42:53,377 --> 00:42:55,477
Speaker 0: And then magically she comes back anyway.

859
00:42:56,002 --> 00:42:56,910
Speaker 1: That's exactly what happened.

860
00:42:57,372 --> 00:42:58,464
Speaker 0: That happens in all the movies.

861
00:42:58,667 --> 00:42:58,950
Speaker 1: Okay.

862
00:42:59,510 --> 00:43:00,689
Speaker 0: Happens all the time.

863
00:43:01,051 --> 00:43:01,455
Speaker 1: Okay.

864
00:43:02,081 --> 00:43:04,469
Speaker 0: Though in the R movie she actually just dies.

865
00:43:05,098 --> 00:43:05,908
Speaker 0: And then comes back to life.

866
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,643
Speaker 0: For basically no reason.

867
00:43:08,127 --> 00:43:08,430
Speaker 1: Okay.

868
00:43:09,571 --> 00:43:15,115
Speaker 0: But they have a Sailor Teleport in that one, which I'm surprised they didn't use here because the fact that they meet the outer sentries.

869
00:43:15,135 --> 00:43:19,641
Speaker 1: Yeah, they had to go make a boat or something to get to where the space station they need to go to.

870
00:43:19,662 --> 00:43:25,721
Speaker 0: Even if these don't fit in the continuity, they knew Sailor Teleport before they met those outer sentries, so ugh.

871
00:43:26,226 --> 00:43:26,670
Speaker 0: God.

872
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:33,910
Speaker 0: Also, Queen Badine looks almost exactly like Sailor Galaxia from Starz, so maybe there's a connection?

873
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,101
Speaker 1: Maybe it's just the same artist, lazy character designer?

874
00:43:37,222 --> 00:43:39,550
Speaker 0: I can Gandalf girth a connection, but I'm not going to.

875
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:41,430
Speaker 0: And also, we're not talking about the manga, which is different.

876
00:43:41,490 --> 00:43:41,653
Speaker 0: No manga.

877
00:43:44,134 --> 00:43:45,410
Speaker 1: How much of the manga have you read?

878
00:43:46,072 --> 00:43:50,597
Speaker 0: I've read like five or six random volumes of the manga in random books.

879
00:43:50,618 --> 00:43:52,538
Speaker 1: Okay, I thought you were gonna say you read the whole thing.

880
00:43:52,841 --> 00:43:54,983
Speaker 0: I've read like two Starzes and a few others.

881
00:43:55,003 --> 00:43:57,183
Speaker 1: Didn't you read all of Meisani Goku off the shelf?

882
00:43:57,688 --> 00:43:57,930
Speaker 0: Yes.

883
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,370
Speaker 1: Without ever buying a volume?

884
00:43:59,653 --> 00:44:02,969
Speaker 0: I also read all the Sailor Moon that I ever read at the same Walden books.

885
00:44:04,350 --> 00:44:08,561
Speaker 1: Okay, so, Sailor Moon, the one we watched was super S.

886
00:44:08,582 --> 00:44:09,370
Speaker 0: Super S movie.

887
00:44:09,590 --> 00:44:10,850
Speaker 0: The last Sailor Moon movie ever made.

888
00:44:10,990 --> 00:44:13,250
Speaker 1: Candy pedophiles and stupidity.

889
00:44:14,270 --> 00:44:14,520
Speaker 0: The movie.

890
00:44:15,171 --> 00:44:25,390
Speaker 1: If you really want to lull and you were mad wasted on some substances and you want to see some guys convince children into his boat with candy.

891
00:44:25,530 --> 00:44:30,229
Speaker 0: To then take him to his master to put them in a black hole.

892
00:44:30,790 --> 00:44:31,220
Speaker 0: Queen Badian.

893
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:33,489
Speaker 0: Queen Badian.

894
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,944
Speaker 0: Which means, roughly, Star Anus.

895
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,690
Speaker 1: So he's gonna put him in the Anus black hole, these children that were lured.

896
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:44,379
Speaker 0: No, into her wonderful black dream hole.

897
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:51,608
Speaker 1: Right, so they lure children with candy into the queen's wonderful black dream hole of Anus.

898
00:44:53,511 --> 00:44:55,165
Speaker 1: You can watch this movie.

899
00:44:55,205 --> 00:44:56,073
Speaker 1: It's only an hour.

900
00:44:56,114 --> 00:44:57,289
Speaker 1: You're not suffering that much.

901
00:44:57,350 --> 00:45:00,670
Speaker 0: And all the Sailor Moon movies are actually really well animated.

902
00:45:01,473 --> 00:45:03,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, the animation was actually pretty good.

903
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:06,040
Speaker 1: I don't know what year it was from, but I was like, "Oh, high budget on the

904
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:06,242
Speaker 1: animation.".

905
00:45:06,263 --> 00:45:06,830
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon's hit or miss.

906
00:45:06,990 --> 00:45:09,995
Speaker 0: There's a point in stars where the animation goes way to shit.

907
00:45:10,076 --> 00:45:14,501
Speaker 0: I think there were scab artists because something happened during the series.

908
00:45:14,561 --> 00:45:15,389
Speaker 1: I'm sure Wikipedia knows it.

909
00:45:15,530 --> 00:45:20,153
Speaker 0: There's a few episodes where the animation goes way off model and way to shit.

910
00:45:20,174 --> 00:45:20,550
Speaker 1: Island episodes.

911
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:23,833
Speaker 0: There are parts of Sailor Moon, especially the movies.

912
00:45:23,853 --> 00:45:26,830
Speaker 0: They're actually the facial expressions and the way they're drawn.

913
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:29,430
Speaker 0: The animation is great.

914
00:45:29,831 --> 00:45:32,670
Speaker 0: I forgot how much I like some of this old cel animation.

915
00:45:33,671 --> 00:45:36,399
Speaker 0: The animation alone makes up for...

916
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:40,284
Speaker 1: I mean, there was a lot of stuff where you would see they weren't trying.

917
00:45:40,386 --> 00:45:43,165
Speaker 1: They were skimping on the animation, right?

918
00:45:43,186 --> 00:45:48,115
Speaker 1: There'd be a scene where only the mouth moves or the people are just sort of standing there.

919
00:45:48,216 --> 00:45:48,783
Speaker 0: But it was all.

920
00:45:49,531 --> 00:45:51,026
Speaker 1: really the colors are nice.

921
00:45:51,208 --> 00:45:53,288
Speaker 1: It was high resolution, even though it wasn't HD.

922
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:55,410
Speaker 1: It was pretty good.

923
00:45:55,590 --> 00:46:00,298
Speaker 1: Like, wow, this looks pretty great, considering it's a one hour throwaway kind of movie situation.

924
00:46:00,319 --> 00:46:03,129
Speaker 0: It was surprisingly okay to watch, again.

925
00:46:03,472 --> 00:46:04,629
Speaker 0: I saw it once a long time ago.

926
00:46:05,433 --> 00:46:12,282
Speaker 1: It wasn't painful to watch, and it was fun to make fun of, but this isn't some great anime movie you've got to run out to see right away.

927
00:46:12,566 --> 00:46:12,810
Speaker 0: Yeah.

928
00:46:13,150 --> 00:46:18,528
Speaker 0: Though it is worth watching at least one of the three Sailor Moon movies, just to kind of get a feel for what Sailor Moon is and was.

929
00:46:19,554 --> 00:46:20,829
Speaker 0: And to know that thing.

930
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:22,346
Speaker 0: To know what that is.

931
00:46:23,412 --> 00:46:25,188
Speaker 0: Also, the plot of this really is The Matrix.

932
00:46:26,670 --> 00:46:28,508
Speaker 0: But with pied pedo pepper pipers.

933
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:31,921
Speaker 0: Pedo piper bear pepper.

934
00:46:31,941 --> 00:46:34,890
Speaker 1: Imagine if Noah from Noah's Ark was collecting to children.

935
00:46:36,967 --> 00:46:40,450
Speaker 1: But because he wanted to start the flood, not because the flood already was coming.

936
00:46:41,051 --> 00:46:43,348
Speaker 1: He was going to use the children to make a flood.

937
00:46:45,776 --> 00:46:46,263
Speaker 0: If only.

938
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:53,718
Speaker 0: I kind of want to know what Kunihiko Ikuhara's version of this was going to be because it focused only on the awesome sailors.

939
00:46:54,042 --> 00:47:05,175
Speaker 0: And the plot was apparently going to be that one of them was in a deep sleep, like in this dream world, and the other one was going to go attack the other normal sailors and steal their shit and use that to save her girlfriend.

940
00:47:05,317 --> 00:47:10,369
Speaker 1: Dude, one sailor with all the sailor shit who's confident and actually can cast all those spells at once.

941
00:47:11,090 --> 00:47:13,499
Speaker 1: That's got to be much better than this movie.

942
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:13,843
Speaker 0: Yeah.

943
00:47:13,944 --> 00:47:14,570
Speaker 0: That we just saw.

944
00:47:14,671 --> 00:47:27,323
Speaker 0: Ikuhara said, which is really interesting, in an interview, that he took a lot of the ideas he had for what was going to be the Sailor Moon Super S movie and pulled them out of his bag when it was time to make Shoujo Kakumei Utena.

945
00:47:27,566 --> 00:47:27,830
Speaker 1: Great.

946
00:47:28,630 --> 00:47:34,690
Speaker 0: Which, that's why I want to see what this movie would have been because I think it would have been a lot like Utena because he realized there's swords being pulled out of people's chests and stuff.

947
00:47:34,950 --> 00:47:36,610
Speaker 1: Instead, it's just a throw away whatever.

948
00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:39,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, with the guys who turned into birds.

949
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,008
Speaker 0: Yeah.

950
00:47:40,510 --> 00:47:41,308
Speaker 0: Banana and orange.

951
00:47:42,838 --> 00:47:46,198
Speaker 1: At least their existence in character design is humorous.

952
00:47:46,401 --> 00:47:46,684
Speaker 1: Yeah.

953
00:47:46,967 --> 00:47:48,466
Speaker 1: That's the best I can say about that.

954
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,138
Speaker 0: That's all we can say.

955
00:47:50,159 --> 00:47:52,007
Speaker 0: I don't know, watch some anime.

956
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's probably something else you could be watching instead of this.

957
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:04,163
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

958
00:48:04,224 --> 00:48:09,180
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.
