1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,083
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday March 14th, and this is geek night tonight.

2
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:15,410
Speaker 1: We talk about our favorite video game.

3
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:18,106
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:18,913 --> 00:00:24,984
Speaker 0: Well, if you can hear this that means that libsyn is yet again working Adequately, I suppose it's

5
00:00:25,044 --> 00:00:35,530
Speaker 1: quite surprising That you know there's so many people in the forums at libsyn having trouble that it would make you believe Going there that libsyn is super broken, but really all the users are just super stupid.

6
00:00:35,871 --> 00:00:41,090
Speaker 0: I mean there were a lot of problems with libsyn recently that they've also apparently recently resolved.

7
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:49,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, but still the amount the sheer numbers of people who did not know what the hell they were doing is near staggering.

8
00:00:49,793 --> 00:01:01,928
Speaker 0: Well, I think the main problem is that libsyn really doesn't offer any documentation whatsoever and The only support there is is hidden in their forums contributed by I guess their employees.

9
00:01:01,968 --> 00:01:02,650
Speaker 0: I'm really not sure.

10
00:01:02,951 --> 00:01:04,155
Speaker 1: Well, they have this there.

11
00:01:04,175 --> 00:01:04,394
Speaker 0: you.

12
00:01:04,536 --> 00:01:07,465
Speaker 1: libsyn is using this business model that I learned about recently.

13
00:01:07,806 --> 00:01:08,829
Speaker 1: It's known as the.

14
00:01:10,311 --> 00:01:11,817
Speaker 1: It's the gym membership model.

15
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:21,090
Speaker 1: what you do is you get a whole bunch of people to join and pay money But then only a small portion of those people actually take advantage of these services that you have sold them.

16
00:01:21,371 --> 00:01:26,638
Speaker 1: It's like if everyone who had a membership to like Gold's gym Actually showed up to work out.

17
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,169
Speaker 1: They'd be out of business so fast you wouldn't even know what to do.

18
00:01:29,872 --> 00:01:37,609
Speaker 0: You know the fact that only like they count on the fat guy who has a New Year's resolution Gets a year membership and then doesn't come back after March.

19
00:01:37,991 --> 00:01:44,559
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like as long as only 20% of the people go they're all set They don't have to make a bigger gym or anything.

20
00:01:45,222 --> 00:01:46,810
Speaker 1: So libsyn is doing the same thing.

21
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:48,561
Speaker 1: They're hoping all these people will pay money.

22
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:50,030
Speaker 0: Well, at least that's what you're assuming.

23
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:52,564
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that's the only way they could be making money off of this.

24
00:01:52,604 --> 00:01:53,750
Speaker 1: giving you infinite bandwidth.

25
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:56,565
Speaker 0: Come on infinite bandwidth isn't really that expensive.

26
00:01:56,645 --> 00:01:57,550
Speaker 1: It's pretty expensive.

27
00:01:58,052 --> 00:02:07,290
Speaker 1: What they do is they have a whole bunch of people who either you know say they're gonna do X podcast But do much fewer or they have many very much fewer listeners.

28
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:12,670
Speaker 1: Or they have people who sign up and don't actually podcast at all or stop podcasting.

29
00:02:13,391 --> 00:02:16,123
Speaker 0: And well, you stop podcasting you stop paying almost immediately.

30
00:02:16,203 --> 00:02:21,910
Speaker 0: if you're smart enough to stop paying It's real hard to accidentally continue to pay because it's PayPal.

31
00:02:22,951 --> 00:02:25,570
Speaker 1: Alright, but doesn't it just automatically subtract everything?

32
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:28,981
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one's gonna leave libsyn going if they don't have a podcast.

33
00:02:29,021 --> 00:02:31,650
Speaker 1: people leave MMOs going and they don't know.

34
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:34,281
Speaker 0: No people leave MMOs going because they don't want to lose their character.

35
00:02:34,301 --> 00:02:35,325
Speaker 0: if they ever want to play again.

36
00:02:35,385 --> 00:02:36,650
Speaker 1: people leave libsyn going Cuz.

37
00:02:36,670 --> 00:02:37,874
Speaker 1: they don't lose their podcast.

38
00:02:38,295 --> 00:02:39,238
Speaker 0: I really doubt that.

39
00:02:39,258 --> 00:02:43,070
Speaker 0: I don't think that that's a significant number at all of their membership.

40
00:02:43,732 --> 00:02:44,074
Speaker 1: I don't know.

41
00:02:44,256 --> 00:02:45,162
Speaker 1: These people are so dumb.

42
00:02:45,182 --> 00:02:46,289
Speaker 1: They don't even know how to use the thing.

43
00:02:46,796 --> 00:02:47,830
Speaker 0: I didn't even know how to use it.

44
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:51,930
Speaker 0: I had to read this forum post to try to guess at how half the libsyn crap works.

45
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,060
Speaker 0: Well, okay, they don't document it at all.

46
00:02:54,542 --> 00:02:58,520
Speaker 0: You click upload you upload it Yeah, and they have all this other stuff like.

47
00:02:58,561 --> 00:03:01,721
Speaker 0: I had to go in and find the crap web page They made for us and get rid of it.

48
00:03:01,761 --> 00:03:04,450
Speaker 0: So no one got confused All right.

49
00:03:04,553 --> 00:03:07,737
Speaker 1: But anyway That's how they're making money is a whole day.

50
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:13,022
Speaker 1: a few people are using it a whole lot and using a ton of bandwidth and they're Being supported by the people who aren't using so much.

51
00:03:13,444 --> 00:03:14,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, well at least that's your assumption.

52
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:15,414
Speaker 0: We don't really know.

53
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:16,922
Speaker 0: I mean, we don't know what their books look like.

54
00:03:17,143 --> 00:03:22,225
Speaker 1: if they're not doing it that way I can't imagine a way they are doing it and unless there's some secret to it.

55
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:23,330
Speaker 1: They're gonna be out of business.

56
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:26,501
Speaker 0: I think very simply not that many people listen to podcasts.

57
00:03:26,521 --> 00:03:28,067
Speaker 0: So it's really not that much bandwidth.

58
00:03:28,107 --> 00:03:31,865
Speaker 1: all told no They were using what was it like terabytes a day.

59
00:03:31,905 --> 00:03:35,539
Speaker 0: I think they said yeah Yeah, whatever penny arcade gets two million unique hits a day.

60
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,883
Speaker 1: Yeah for an image.

61
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:41,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're talking about like Zillions of mp3 minutes.

62
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:42,201
Speaker 0: Yeah.

63
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:43,526
Speaker 0: I just don't think it's really that much.

64
00:03:43,567 --> 00:03:45,729
Speaker 1: all things considered It's quite a lot.

65
00:03:46,931 --> 00:03:48,516
Speaker 1: You don't seem to understand these.

66
00:03:48,938 --> 00:03:51,325
Speaker 0: No, I just don't think that many people listen to podcasts yet.

67
00:03:51,747 --> 00:03:52,991
Speaker 1: No, they really do Do you?

68
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:54,738
Speaker 1: I need to play for you the podcast they were.

69
00:03:54,778 --> 00:03:57,249
Speaker 1: they interview the Libsyn guy and ask him how it's going.

70
00:03:57,754 --> 00:04:00,674
Speaker 1: It's crazy Absolutely crazy.

71
00:04:00,694 --> 00:04:02,622
Speaker 0: All right, whatever the point is we're on Libsyn now.

72
00:04:02,964 --> 00:04:03,144
Speaker 0: Yep.

73
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:13,370
Speaker 0: Anyway in the news You know Sony had their dual shock patent dispute where this company called immersion For those of you who aren't familiar with this basically had a patent on.

74
00:04:13,811 --> 00:04:20,649
Speaker 0: Now this is gonna sound stupid but rumble packs at least in terms of console game controllers work all the same way.

75
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:24,090
Speaker 0: They have an unbalanced weight and you spin it to make a rumbling effect.

76
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:26,530
Speaker 1: Well, how come they're not going after a Nintendo or anyone?

77
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,472
Speaker 0: I was about to get to that.

78
00:04:27,713 --> 00:04:33,170
Speaker 0: this patent specifically covers having two of these devices in a controller hence dual shock.

79
00:04:34,015 --> 00:04:34,720
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't realize.

80
00:04:34,761 --> 00:04:36,070
Speaker 1: the dual shock had two rumbles.

81
00:04:36,191 --> 00:04:40,068
Speaker 1: I thought it was called the dual shock because it had the two analog sticks and it had a rumble.

82
00:04:40,349 --> 00:04:48,790
Speaker 0: now It had two rumbles that were identical And X Microsoft used the same thing in the Xbox and they settled quietly out of court.

83
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:54,327
Speaker 0: Sony tried to fight it lost appealed and just recently lost the appeal.

84
00:04:54,347 --> 00:04:58,089
Speaker 0: Oh They're gonna have to pay at least eighty two million dollars to the company.

85
00:04:58,311 --> 00:05:01,408
Speaker 1: Yeah They make a lot of freaking money off of those controllers.

86
00:05:01,589 --> 00:05:07,870
Speaker 0: now Nintendo only has one gyro in there because they knew about the patent and they didn't want to infringe on it.

87
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:08,152
Speaker 1: You know what?

88
00:05:08,172 --> 00:05:09,138
Speaker 0: I gotta say for it.

89
00:05:09,339 --> 00:05:11,070
Speaker 1: I don't see how to is that much better than one?

90
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:17,790
Speaker 1: I mean is better is two more than it for the small effect that the rumble actually gives in a game at all.

91
00:05:18,212 --> 00:05:22,130
Speaker 1: You know the the one rumble in the GameCube controller is just fine.

92
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:27,030
Speaker 0: I think the point was that if you have two rumbles you could control them separately and have different effects.

93
00:05:27,951 --> 00:05:33,910
Speaker 1: Maybe but I don't really feel like I'm missing out on anything then what we're really missing out on is force feedback.

94
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:39,770
Speaker 1: You know why there's no force feedback controllers anymore because there's a patent and that company isn't licensing it or anything.

95
00:05:40,091 --> 00:05:45,485
Speaker 0: Well, also the fact that support for force feedback was varied and marginal at best.

96
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:46,227
Speaker 1: Well, they were going.

97
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,270
Speaker 1: they were on the verge.

98
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:48,454
Speaker 1: They were making a standard.

99
00:05:48,494 --> 00:05:51,325
Speaker 1: they had a standard actually for how force feedback should work.

100
00:05:51,365 --> 00:05:52,730
Speaker 1: It was in DirectX and everything.

101
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:55,941
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then these patent holding bastards messed up the whole thing.

102
00:05:55,961 --> 00:05:58,148
Speaker 1: So now there's no force feedback joysticks or anything.

103
00:05:58,329 --> 00:05:58,710
Speaker 0: That's fine.

104
00:05:58,710 --> 00:05:59,582
Speaker 0: There's no joysticks.

105
00:05:59,846 --> 00:06:03,650
Speaker 0: Yeah There's no PC games that need good joysticks.

106
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:04,530
Speaker 0: There's no good joysticks.

107
00:06:04,991 --> 00:06:05,774
Speaker 0: Force feedback doesn't.

108
00:06:05,854 --> 00:06:14,736
Speaker 1: but there is evidence to suggest that if they had to force feedback and went through they would have made because Microsoft Was making the joysticks with force feedback Would have made the games for.

109
00:06:14,796 --> 00:06:18,630
Speaker 0: and somehow I don't think force feedback was gonna save the PC gaming industry.

110
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:24,200
Speaker 1: I wasn't gonna say the PC gaming industry, but it would have saved joysticks I don't think it would have because there still wouldn't have at a market.

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,349
Speaker 0: I mean how many people buy joysticks now?

112
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:28,297
Speaker 1: No one cuz they don't sell them.

113
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,405
Speaker 0: No, they sell them.

114
00:06:29,425 --> 00:06:29,888
Speaker 0: They're out there.

115
00:06:30,412 --> 00:06:32,706
Speaker 0: I bought one a while ago so I could play x-wing Alliance.

116
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:37,475
Speaker 1: awesome Yeah, but anyway it would as they would have helped Something.

117
00:06:37,857 --> 00:06:40,070
Speaker 0: nah, I think it was too little too late.

118
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:44,429
Speaker 0: The problem was is that we I mean, you know, I could sit in the bottom of the Titanic with a bucket.

119
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:45,332
Speaker 1: See.

120
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:50,630
Speaker 1: the other problem is that all the force feedback you've ever experienced is the shitty kind because the good kind is super patented.

121
00:06:50,953 --> 00:06:53,936
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't say force feedback was bad I just said that's definitely not.

122
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:58,957
Speaker 0: that wasn't gonna help the PC gaming industry and no Force feedback would have been.

123
00:06:58,977 --> 00:07:01,530
Speaker 0: it still would have gone away because there aren't any games.

124
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:04,019
Speaker 1: There would have been games if there was force feedback.

125
00:07:04,039 --> 00:07:04,942
Speaker 1: that was so quality.

126
00:07:04,982 --> 00:07:08,581
Speaker 1: people would have made games just to use that and sell It based on that gimmick alone.

127
00:07:08,601 --> 00:07:11,658
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like there was.

128
00:07:11,718 --> 00:07:14,750
Speaker 1: no there aren't any touchscreen games and now this is touch screen.

129
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,136
Speaker 1: So now this touchscreen games.

130
00:07:16,558 --> 00:07:18,950
Speaker 1: well there weren't any force feedback joystick games.

131
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,706
Speaker 1: This is no force feedback joystick.

132
00:07:20,726 --> 00:07:32,230
Speaker 1: point out However, that there's a huge huge market for Nintendo DS game But the market did not appear until the DS is made just as the market for force feedback Joysticks would not appear until the joysticks existed.

133
00:07:32,731 --> 00:07:34,016
Speaker 1: You have to make the product first.

134
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,119
Speaker 1: then the market appears.

135
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:40,040
Speaker 0: see the problem is people were moving away from the PC gaming market already And I don't think people were gonna know.

136
00:07:40,141 --> 00:07:41,329
Speaker 1: This is a long time ago.

137
00:07:41,651 --> 00:07:42,273
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what?

138
00:07:42,373 --> 00:07:44,300
Speaker 0: PC gaming was in decline a long time ago.

139
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,765
Speaker 1: No, it wasn't in decline.

140
00:07:45,785 --> 00:07:49,159
Speaker 1: This was even before like You came out.

141
00:07:49,522 --> 00:07:50,410
Speaker 0: you're entitled to your opinion.

142
00:07:51,152 --> 00:07:51,594
Speaker 1: It's a fact.

143
00:07:51,634 --> 00:07:56,790
Speaker 1: this was in the olden days and PC gaming was at its peak that the force feedback debacle occurred.

144
00:07:57,117 --> 00:07:57,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you know what?

145
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:00,401
Speaker 0: I didn't care about it then and then PC gaming died and I stopped caring.

146
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:03,278
Speaker 1: you didn't care about him because it was the stupid Dispute.

147
00:08:03,338 --> 00:08:05,030
Speaker 1: Oh my god alright.

148
00:08:06,290 --> 00:08:08,798
Speaker 1: So the whole hubbub on the big the net today.

149
00:08:08,878 --> 00:08:12,670
Speaker 1: Is that Dell may or may not be buying Alienware?

150
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,464
Speaker 0: I haven't heard anything about this and if it's true, I don't care.

151
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:16,430
Speaker 1: I saw it on my play.

152
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:18,297
Speaker 0: I don't give a shit song if I had it finished yet.

153
00:08:18,698 --> 00:08:21,790
Speaker 1: I saw it on like 10 websites like Dell buys Alienware.

154
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,518
Speaker 0: Question mark, why does anyone even care?

155
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:26,224
Speaker 0: Alienware doesn't make good hardware.

156
00:08:26,525 --> 00:08:28,010
Speaker 0: Dell makes average hardware.

157
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,709
Speaker 0: Alienware isn't special in any way anymore.

158
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,813
Speaker 1: That's exactly the whole story.

159
00:08:33,256 --> 00:08:34,359
Speaker 0: is that so it's not a story.

160
00:08:34,961 --> 00:08:40,350
Speaker 1: Well, the story is is that you know people who buy pre-made computers and have too much money.

161
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:47,978
Speaker 1: They don't have to do with all by these Alienware things and all the normal people buy the Dell things and Dell also makes this Like line of gamer computers.

162
00:08:47,998 --> 00:08:57,250
Speaker 1: So now there's people who are like If this really happens then all those Dell gamer computers are gonna be super cheap and we can go scoop them up.

163
00:08:58,678 --> 00:09:00,875
Speaker 0: Yeah Computers are already super cheap.

164
00:09:01,337 --> 00:09:06,071
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you can build a tricked-out computer for you know, $400.

165
00:09:06,071 --> 00:09:08,139
Speaker 1: No, these are like the insane Oh computers.

166
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,244
Speaker 0: Oh so useless.

167
00:09:09,505 --> 00:09:10,710
Speaker 1: Well, no not useless.

168
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:19,549
Speaker 1: The fact is what would normally be useless because it's so expensive would become cheap because Dell would just try to get rid of that Computers to put in the new Alienware line.

169
00:09:21,278 --> 00:09:23,630
Speaker 1: But we have no idea about if this is true or not.

170
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:31,009
Speaker 1: However, the latest evidence is that you know on to the already existing pile is that Dell has canceled some?

171
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:43,683
Speaker 1: sneak preview press event at the game developers conference, so We'll say That's like the scandest evidence for anything else the game developers conference.

172
00:09:43,743 --> 00:09:44,406
Speaker 1: and it's Dell.

173
00:09:44,466 --> 00:09:45,770
Speaker 1: so Dell makes computers.

174
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:46,860
Speaker 1: They're gonna talk it again.

175
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:54,563
Speaker 0: developers conference Alienware then Yeah, makes gaming computers, you know, there are very few things in this world.

176
00:09:54,624 --> 00:09:56,610
Speaker 0: I care less about than Alienware or Dell.

177
00:09:57,373 --> 00:10:03,554
Speaker 0: I just care a little bit about Dell because I deal with them on a regular basis, but Alien, yeah I don't really care because it.

178
00:10:04,016 --> 00:10:16,609
Speaker 1: I don't really care because it won't affect me at all because I don't care about Dell or Alienware as far as I'm concerned, but as far as tech in general is is concerned this could cause some Changes like what?

179
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:31,750
Speaker 0: Like you know, yeah, I'm listening Decrease Okay, so suddenly there's a flood of cheap powerful PCs and then that dries up because they're not making them anymore.

180
00:10:32,072 --> 00:10:40,809
Speaker 1: well, no, not that but the fact that Dell buys Alienware and And now I can't think of any ramification that really matters at all.

181
00:10:41,592 --> 00:10:45,927
Speaker 1: All those idiots buying like expensive computers, you know can't buy Alienwares.

182
00:10:45,948 --> 00:10:46,610
Speaker 1: they have to buy Dells.

183
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:47,934
Speaker 1: They might not want to.

184
00:10:48,115 --> 00:10:52,309
Speaker 1: they might all buy Dells in you because they're Alienwares, you know things to get weird.

185
00:10:54,091 --> 00:10:56,420
Speaker 0: That doesn't sound so worrisome or weird.

186
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,443
Speaker 1: or maybe they'll be all.

187
00:10:57,543 --> 00:10:59,410
Speaker 1: maybe there'll be some sort of Intel AMD thing.

188
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:08,409
Speaker 1: I mean AMD is currently winning now in terms of gamers and which which is faster I mean in the latest steam survey, there's more AMD's than Intel's going on.

189
00:11:09,413 --> 00:11:13,129
Speaker 1: So maybe you know Dell doesn't really make so many AMD's as far as I know.

190
00:11:13,973 --> 00:11:23,209
Speaker 1: So if they get the Alienware, maybe they'll be less AMD's and more Intel's Yeah, or maybe this will change something in some sort of Nvidia ATI way.

191
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:24,849
Speaker 1: Who knows?

192
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:26,212
Speaker 0: All right.

193
00:11:26,696 --> 00:11:28,549
Speaker 0: I don't think this is gonna have any effect anywhere.

194
00:11:29,551 --> 00:11:31,194
Speaker 0: If it even happens, we'll see.

195
00:11:38,245 --> 00:11:38,626
Speaker 0: All right.

196
00:11:38,726 --> 00:11:44,902
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day I found this Transcript someone made of World of Warcraft.

197
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:46,710
Speaker 0: had it been a text adventure.

198
00:11:47,531 --> 00:11:55,490
Speaker 0: Wait, so is it actually a text adventure you play or no, no, no No, it's just a transcript of what World of Warcraft would be like if it was a text adventure.

199
00:11:56,012 --> 00:12:00,610
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's like N and then there's a carriage return and then it says there's a monster something like that.

200
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:11,639
Speaker 0: All right, and basically in my opinion this distills Everything that I hate about World of Warcraft because it takes you know This abstract game and it compresses it down into.

201
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:13,405
Speaker 0: here's what you're actually doing.

202
00:12:13,425 --> 00:12:14,107
Speaker 0: They're pretty.

203
00:12:14,148 --> 00:12:14,890
Speaker 0: graphics aside.

204
00:12:15,011 --> 00:12:17,150
Speaker 0: Here's what you were doing with your life hour after hour.

205
00:12:18,351 --> 00:12:27,770
Speaker 1: Maybe people who played see the problem is there are a million things like this that just plainly show What's wrong with these sorts of games and people who play it read it and laugh and go?

206
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:29,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what it is and they keep playing.

207
00:12:30,492 --> 00:12:32,379
Speaker 1: If someone shows me something I'm doing is dumb.

208
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,105
Speaker 1: I stopped doing it.

209
00:12:34,748 --> 00:12:35,290
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

210
00:12:36,291 --> 00:12:42,305
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm not gonna get into it here, but you don't make eggs.

211
00:12:42,365 --> 00:12:46,219
Speaker 1: very well when you cook I make I like I weigh like.

212
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:48,767
Speaker 1: I like the way you make McDonald's eggs.

213
00:12:48,787 --> 00:12:49,650
Speaker 1: It's not a McDonald's.

214
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:55,526
Speaker 0: Have a solid massive egg that you make hot and there's just this dense mass of a.

215
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:56,549
Speaker 1: that's what egg is.

216
00:12:56,910 --> 00:12:57,573
Speaker 0: It's not a.

217
00:12:57,674 --> 00:13:00,608
Speaker 1: you make it hot until it's not goopy anymore and you eat it.

218
00:13:02,492 --> 00:13:02,895
Speaker 1: That's how you.

219
00:13:02,956 --> 00:13:03,763
Speaker 1: it's what you do with an egg.

220
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:09,527
Speaker 0: All right Yeah, that's right, so uh, what's your thing of the day mr.

221
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:10,190
Speaker 0: McDonald's egg?

222
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:14,190
Speaker 1: Well Mortal Kombat 3 is sort of the not so good fighting game.

223
00:13:14,371 --> 00:13:17,001
Speaker 0: I'd submit that it's one of the worst fighting games ever made.

224
00:13:17,202 --> 00:13:19,010
Speaker 1: No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

225
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:25,454
Speaker 1: I said one of no in the pit of worst is definitely in the mediocre Fighting game area.

226
00:13:25,634 --> 00:13:29,825
Speaker 1: the worst fighting game area is reserved for many games.

227
00:13:29,905 --> 00:13:31,710
Speaker 1: I can't even mention cuz battle raper.

228
00:13:33,334 --> 00:13:35,869
Speaker 1: Um, no, they're even worse ones than that.

229
00:13:36,852 --> 00:13:39,180
Speaker 1: Let me think can you name Shaq foo?

230
00:13:39,521 --> 00:13:42,090
Speaker 0: Shaq foo was kind of awesome until I wasn't a fighting game.

231
00:13:43,051 --> 00:13:47,429
Speaker 0: It was a what it was a platformer slash walk down the street hitting things game weapon lords.

232
00:13:48,612 --> 00:13:49,819
Speaker 0: That game wasn't so bad.

233
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:50,906
Speaker 1: Oh, that was the worst.

234
00:13:50,926 --> 00:13:51,489
Speaker 1: that all right.

235
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:52,995
Speaker 1: We'll play it later and we'll see.

236
00:13:53,156 --> 00:13:55,284
Speaker 0: I'd rather play that than Mortal Kombat 3.

237
00:13:55,284 --> 00:13:56,589
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

238
00:13:57,031 --> 00:14:00,729
Speaker 1: Anyway, it was much worse than Mortal Kombat 2 and 1 for sure.

239
00:14:00,809 --> 00:14:06,950
Speaker 1: So Of course like every other Mortal Kombat game they had fatalities which are introduced in Mortal Kombat 1.

240
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,757
Speaker 1: We're basically this little gimmick of thing.

241
00:14:08,777 --> 00:14:12,090
Speaker 1: You know, you memorize some button pattern and you could see a cool animation.

242
00:14:12,592 --> 00:14:13,938
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was a horrible thing.

243
00:14:14,099 --> 00:14:15,103
Speaker 0: Basically the way it worked.

244
00:14:15,124 --> 00:14:16,550
Speaker 0: for any of you never played Mortal Kombat.

245
00:14:16,711 --> 00:14:17,919
Speaker 0: I mean modern fighting games.

246
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:21,145
Speaker 0: the combos make sense like in Soul Calibur.

247
00:14:21,165 --> 00:14:25,905
Speaker 0: a Combo is basically just doing moves in a certain order usually or getting into a stancer make.

248
00:14:25,945 --> 00:14:27,129
Speaker 0: there's some sort of flow to it.

249
00:14:27,612 --> 00:14:32,750
Speaker 0: in Mortal Kombat Moves were things like up up down left down up down a be down up down left.

250
00:14:33,437 --> 00:14:34,489
Speaker 1: No, they're simpler than that.

251
00:14:34,550 --> 00:14:35,555
Speaker 1: But there's something.

252
00:14:35,615 --> 00:14:36,480
Speaker 0: everyone had a complex.

253
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:38,510
Speaker 1: some of the special moves are pretty complicated.

254
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,565
Speaker 1: But all the combos in Mortal Kombat 10, especially starting in Mortal Kombat 2 tended to be juggle combos.

255
00:14:43,805 --> 00:14:49,707
Speaker 0: now until you get to fatalities Yeah, when you beat someone like beat him beat him like you've already won the fight.

256
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:51,493
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter now You've won the end.

257
00:14:51,895 --> 00:14:59,610
Speaker 0: then they'll stand there all woozy and you have about three seconds to do a crazy Combo like something that's almost impossible to do with human fingers.

258
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:01,420
Speaker 1: Well, some of them are simple like I remember.

259
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,170
Speaker 1: some of them were like down down down high kick.

260
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:13,509
Speaker 0: Yeah some of them were like up down left right circle two buttons at once and you had to be a certain distance away from the Guy and yet he's facing in the right direction and if you screw up at all, it didn't work.

261
00:15:13,852 --> 00:15:17,761
Speaker 0: Yep, a lot of times instead of doing it You just punch the guy once and then he'd fall over and it'd be over.

262
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:25,295
Speaker 1: or a lot of times you just uppercut the guy Or your guy would like duck and stand up and then jump and then it would be over And the other guy see.

263
00:15:25,315 --> 00:15:28,729
Speaker 1: if you didn't do it quick enough the other guy would just fall over and the fight was over.

264
00:15:29,174 --> 00:15:33,056
Speaker 0: but it was only really two Bands of appeal in these one.

265
00:15:33,558 --> 00:15:37,670
Speaker 0: middle school kids want to see violence and they were incredibly horridly violent.

266
00:15:38,052 --> 00:15:45,909
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's what it was about - if you're in an arcade It was just like the final stake of humiliation into the guy's throat after you beat him.

267
00:15:46,131 --> 00:15:49,353
Speaker 1: Mortal Kombat 2 was really towards the end of the arcade days Like I remember.

268
00:15:49,394 --> 00:16:02,372
Speaker 1: we have an arcade in our mall where I live and it's still there But it doesn't get so much action now, you know back in the Mortal Kombat 2 days and that machine was there There were people about like crazy playing Mortal Kombat 2.

269
00:16:02,372 --> 00:16:03,519
Speaker 0: There's an arcade called tilt.

270
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:07,138
Speaker 0: actually in the mall where I grew up There used to be water slides in the mall.

271
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,650
Speaker 0: Whoa, and then they got rid of those water slides.

272
00:16:09,831 --> 00:16:13,986
Speaker 0: I never got to use him because I know when I was really young I'd always see him and I never knew what they were.

273
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:22,270
Speaker 0: and Because they were like in this special glassed-off area and before I was old enough to do it They shut it down and they put an arcade in there instead.

274
00:16:22,591 --> 00:16:23,254
Speaker 1: No, that's not so bad.

275
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:28,439
Speaker 0: And so I used to hang out of that arcade, you know back when arcades were awesome They're still awesome.

276
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:38,266
Speaker 1: Just people don't go to them Yeah, and most arcades end up not being awesome because they either go out of because no one goes to them Yeah, because they don't have good games, but they don't have good games cuz no one goes.

277
00:16:38,307 --> 00:16:38,949
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

278
00:16:39,311 --> 00:16:40,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's really.

279
00:16:40,275 --> 00:16:42,705
Speaker 0: it's almost impossible to have a good arcade unless you're in Wildwood.

280
00:16:42,725 --> 00:16:43,347
Speaker 0: go to Japan.

281
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:43,990
Speaker 1: go to Japan.

282
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah in the u.s.

283
00:16:45,174 --> 00:16:50,807
Speaker 1: Mortal Kombat all I got to say about Japan's arcades Mario Kart arcade Yeah, that's all I got to say.

284
00:16:51,692 --> 00:16:57,550
Speaker 0: So I remember when Mortal Kombat 2 like the machine came out and they got two of them in that arcade.

285
00:16:58,253 --> 00:17:06,929
Speaker 0: There was a crowd of people so thick you could not even see the machine Does from the moment that mall opened until the moment it closed every day?

286
00:17:07,770 --> 00:17:14,761
Speaker 1: Yeah I remember when a few months after that every movie theater had a machine and there were at least two guys playing it all the Time and everywhere it was.

287
00:17:14,781 --> 00:17:15,568
Speaker 1: it was the greatest.

288
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:21,369
Speaker 1: Well, not the greatest but anyway Mortal Kombat 3 was not quite so popular because it was after these days.

289
00:17:21,711 --> 00:17:28,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, Mortal Kombat 1 2 & 3 are basically the same game just with more characters and moves and different characters and moves.

290
00:17:28,577 --> 00:17:33,830
Speaker 0: Yeah But uh other games progressed in technology and Mortal Kombat did not.

291
00:17:34,071 --> 00:17:35,274
Speaker 1: Mortal Kombat just add.

292
00:17:35,314 --> 00:17:37,079
Speaker 1: like a Mortal Kombat 1 you had fatalities.

293
00:17:37,179 --> 00:17:50,053
Speaker 1: Mortal Kombat 2 was like the perfection of Mortal Kombat 1. in 3 they added like Babalities and animalities and friendships and all these gimmick crap crazy Nonsense.

294
00:17:50,113 --> 00:17:59,842
Speaker 1: and you'll see in my thing of the day which we finally are getting to now is a video of every single fatality Babality animality and friendship in Mortal Kombat 3.

295
00:17:59,842 --> 00:18:06,145
Speaker 0: so if you think Jack Thompson, you know I mean he hates grand grand theft auto because of all the violence and gore and whatever.

296
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:14,507
Speaker 0: I Don't think the people who crusade against video games these days Remember the shitstorm that arose around Mortal Kombat when we were young.

297
00:18:14,668 --> 00:18:16,796
Speaker 1: no, man That was the first thing they went after.

298
00:18:16,816 --> 00:18:20,570
Speaker 1: it's just they gave up on it when other games, you know became easier target.

299
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:25,970
Speaker 0: I watched this again, and I forgot that Mortal Kombat is still one of the most violent games I've ever played.

300
00:18:26,473 --> 00:18:27,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just.

301
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:32,020
Speaker 1: you know At least in Gran Turismo the gore makes sense.

302
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:34,450
Speaker 1: It's like somewhat realistic like you shoot a guy he dies.

303
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,790
Speaker 0: This is like you punch a guy you knock his head off and you grab his spinal cord and rip it out and whip it.

304
00:18:39,931 --> 00:18:45,430
Speaker 1: Or you know you chop a guy up into ten pieces then blood blows everywhere and then his skeleton comes out.

305
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:47,090
Speaker 1: There's a million Gibbs falling from the sky.

306
00:18:48,411 --> 00:18:56,079
Speaker 0: Unless you had the SNES version of Mortal Kombat 1 then it was sweat and green slime because they weren't allowed to show blood Yep, but the Genesis.

307
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,967
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, it was working just fine.

308
00:18:58,047 --> 00:18:58,690
Speaker 0: blood code.

309
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:02,646
Speaker 1: Of course, if you had either one of those systems, you're probably better off playing Street Fighter.

310
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:09,469
Speaker 1: - yeah Either turbo for the SNES or championship edition for the Genesis Which were pretty much equal games.

311
00:19:10,351 --> 00:19:16,350
Speaker 0: Alright, so it's favorites week and it's Tuesday, which means we could talk about either video games or board games.

312
00:19:16,992 --> 00:19:23,909
Speaker 1: We're you do video games this time and board games will be saved for favorites week - yep Which will come whenever we run out of things to talk about another week.

313
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:32,399
Speaker 1: Yep, and now for our disclaimer Which we're going to say at the beginning of every favorites week episode because you know Some people only listen to some days of the podcast.

314
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:35,270
Speaker 0: Yes, and if you don't know we have more than one day every week.

315
00:19:35,531 --> 00:19:36,936
Speaker 1: Yep, is it?

316
00:19:36,996 --> 00:19:39,163
Speaker 1: favorites is not the same thing as best.

317
00:19:39,826 --> 00:19:48,170
Speaker 1: the best thing ever is Something that everyone can agree on or that you know experts can say oh that is definitely the best video game ever made.

318
00:19:48,571 --> 00:19:52,201
Speaker 1: But it's also very okay to say something's the best and also hate it.

319
00:19:52,883 --> 00:19:55,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's also very up to interpretation and argument.

320
00:19:55,471 --> 00:19:57,680
Speaker 0: I mean Babe Ruth is the best baseball player ever.

321
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:59,447
Speaker 0: No Hank Aaron's the best baseball player ever.

322
00:19:59,467 --> 00:20:00,010
Speaker 0: You can go to hell.

323
00:20:00,191 --> 00:20:07,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could argue that Babe Ruth is the best baseball player ever But at the same time not like Babe Ruth or be a fan of him at all.

324
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:11,425
Speaker 0: Yep, so we're very much talking about our favorite things ever which means one.

325
00:20:11,445 --> 00:20:14,949
Speaker 0: you can debate us But you can't argue with us because it's our opinion.

326
00:20:15,711 --> 00:20:16,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, you could be like.

327
00:20:17,036 --> 00:20:20,930
Speaker 1: the thing you think is the favorite sucks and I'll say okay that means it's not the best.

328
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:24,925
Speaker 1: It doesn't mean it's not my favorite because when I say it's my favorite it is, you know, I'm lying.

329
00:20:24,945 --> 00:20:27,258
Speaker 0: I Don't think we're gonna lie about this.

330
00:20:27,278 --> 00:20:28,103
Speaker 1: No, I don't think.

331
00:20:28,244 --> 00:20:28,788
Speaker 1: why would I lie?

332
00:20:29,714 --> 00:20:37,139
Speaker 1: Big especially when I'm talking, you know If anyone who knows me will know I'm not lying when I say that the best video game Well, not the best video game.

333
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:40,013
Speaker 1: The best video game is probably Zelda 1 or something I don't even know.

334
00:20:40,655 --> 00:20:43,343
Speaker 1: my favorite video game ever is Mega Man 2.

335
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,554
Speaker 0: this kid freaking loves Mega Man 2 in a way That is unhealthy.

336
00:20:46,594 --> 00:20:49,566
Speaker 1: I played Mega Man 2 for the NES like a thousand times.

337
00:20:49,587 --> 00:20:54,525
Speaker 0: I don't even know He is as much a machine at that game as I am at bionic commando.

338
00:20:54,545 --> 00:20:55,790
Speaker 1: No bionic commando.

339
00:20:56,632 --> 00:21:03,513
Speaker 1: I got Mega Man - I got my NES the day before my birthday like April 29th some year I don't even know.

340
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:07,388
Speaker 1: and I got Mario Duck Hunt when I got it the next morning.

341
00:21:07,408 --> 00:21:09,404
Speaker 1: They were like, okay Here's your birthday present is Mega Man.

342
00:21:09,424 --> 00:21:09,444
Speaker 1: -.

343
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:15,773
Speaker 1: Mega Man - oh my god, I Nowadays Mega Man like.

344
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,747
Speaker 1: I'm playing the Mega Man X collection right now, which I'll talk about soon enough.

345
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:21,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have my opinions on most Mega Man games.

346
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:23,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, but new.

347
00:21:23,105 --> 00:21:24,651
Speaker 1: now it's all about figuring out It's.

348
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:31,430
Speaker 1: it's all about knowing what order to beat the guys in knowing where the secret power-ups are the horrible and arbitrary secrets.

349
00:21:31,913 --> 00:21:33,221
Speaker 1: Oh, they're not arbitrary secrets.

350
00:21:33,241 --> 00:21:34,107
Speaker 1: You just don't understand.

351
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:38,599
Speaker 1: but Arbitrary secrets are like Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles.

352
00:21:38,619 --> 00:21:39,682
Speaker 1: That's an arbitrary secret.

353
00:21:40,004 --> 00:21:40,746
Speaker 1: or ogre battle 64.

354
00:21:40,746 --> 00:21:41,228
Speaker 1: That's an hour.

355
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:43,703
Speaker 0: Don't get me started on that game.

356
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:49,210
Speaker 1: All right, but Mega Man - I played that without anyone's help just all on my own.

357
00:21:49,692 --> 00:21:51,739
Speaker 1: I beat it from start every single guy.

358
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:57,619
Speaker 1: like when I first started playing I had no skills whatsoever And I was just trying to beat all eight robot masters.

359
00:21:57,659 --> 00:22:01,130
Speaker 1: Imagine trying to beat eight robot masters not knowing anything.

360
00:22:01,571 --> 00:22:03,236
Speaker 1: It's like you try all the different levels.

361
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:08,614
Speaker 1: you die in quick commands level because the lasers so you just give up on him and wait Until you have more powers.

362
00:22:08,895 --> 00:22:12,410
Speaker 0: Yep, even though honestly, I always tried to beat him first when I first got that game

363
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:23,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then like with flash man I would just flash man was the first guy I could beat so it always beat flash man And then tried to beat everyone else or I'd write down my flash man password and then tried to beat everyone else.

364
00:22:23,771 --> 00:22:29,530
Speaker 1: But then I realized I wanted to be crash man before flash man So I could break all the blocks in his level to get the E and stuff.

365
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:37,150
Speaker 1: Yep, and what I you know, I don't think you needed to break the blocks to get the E. I think you just get the E without them, but you still wanted to break the blocks to make the level go easier.

366
00:22:38,251 --> 00:22:40,664
Speaker 1: But yeah, wow, that game is so terrific.

367
00:22:41,066 --> 00:22:47,870
Speaker 1: I mean Megaman one, you know Megaman 2 doesn't really have much on Megaman 1 in terms of gameplay.

368
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:54,873
Speaker 1: It's just the level design and the bad guys and everything was just more polished You know.

369
00:22:54,893 --> 00:23:05,568
Speaker 1: and Megaman 1 was also stupid hard and really rough around the edges you know and especially like in the later levels like guys would fly around and patterns that kind of didn't make sense.

370
00:23:05,828 --> 00:23:10,298
Speaker 0: and You know, I never beat Megaman 1 ever.

371
00:23:10,379 --> 00:23:16,656
Speaker 1: I beat Megaman 1 but Megaman 1 is just kind of like really bland In fact, I never beat guts man ever.

372
00:23:16,998 --> 00:23:18,602
Speaker 1: Wow, I can be okay.

373
00:23:19,004 --> 00:23:21,291
Speaker 1: I've gotten to the wily parts of Megaman 1.

374
00:23:21,291 --> 00:23:22,796
Speaker 1: Yeah, definitely because that's for you.

375
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:25,446
Speaker 1: fight the yellow guy who you got the one eyeball.

376
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:27,814
Speaker 0: Ah Yeah, I've seen I know him.

377
00:23:27,834 --> 00:23:28,557
Speaker 0: I know what he looks like.

378
00:23:28,617 --> 00:23:31,006
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, that's that's Megaman 1.

379
00:23:31,006 --> 00:23:34,894
Speaker 0: see the first Megaman game I played was Megaman 3 Megaman 3.

380
00:23:34,894 --> 00:23:45,870
Speaker 1: a lot of people say the Megaman 3 is better than Megaman 2. and you know, that's where the slide first appeared and parts of That's our protoman appeared.

381
00:23:47,051 --> 00:23:53,710
Speaker 1: You know, I can't deny some of these things like protoman and the slide or the famous hold left on controller - yeah.

382
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:57,869
Speaker 1: But parts of Megaman 3 also, you know just not.

383
00:23:58,834 --> 00:23:59,597
Speaker 1: It was just different.

384
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:00,682
Speaker 1: It's a whole different feeling.

385
00:24:00,722 --> 00:24:02,270
Speaker 1: I mean you had like Gemini man.

386
00:24:02,812 --> 00:24:06,564
Speaker 1: It's really the bad guys the eight robot master.

387
00:24:06,584 --> 00:24:10,010
Speaker 1: That's why when you go buy a Megaman shirt This is I defeated the eight robot masters.

388
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:11,436
Speaker 1: Whatever eight robot masters.

389
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:14,490
Speaker 1: you see on that shirt the Megaman 2 robot masters.

390
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:16,329
Speaker 1: There's a reason for that.

391
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:26,002
Speaker 1: It was all about the robot masters and their levels that were so perfect and the music that was so perfect That music would be like it's still better any video game music.

392
00:24:26,022 --> 00:24:27,607
Speaker 1: You'll ever find the Megaman 2 music.

393
00:24:27,867 --> 00:24:28,349
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

394
00:24:28,871 --> 00:24:30,396
Speaker 1: Especially the first wily level.

395
00:24:30,777 --> 00:24:32,664
Speaker 1: they had the best music like ever.

396
00:24:33,025 --> 00:24:34,550
Speaker 1: They're like a thousand remixes of it.

397
00:24:34,570 --> 00:24:35,074
Speaker 1: It's so good.

398
00:24:35,577 --> 00:24:39,890
Speaker 0: now see if we're talking that era of games You know the prime of the original NES.

399
00:24:41,151 --> 00:24:46,225
Speaker 0: It's really a toss-up for me between Zelda 2 and bionic commando But I'm gonna have to go with bionic commando.

400
00:24:46,265 --> 00:24:46,990
Speaker 0: that game is just fantastic.

401
00:24:48,012 --> 00:24:50,289
Speaker 1: Yeah, people yell at you if you say Zelda 2 is good.

402
00:24:50,611 --> 00:24:53,305
Speaker 0: Hey, I think Zelda 2 is better than Zelda 1 and you can all go to hell.

403
00:24:53,426 --> 00:25:07,962
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got a problem But anyway bionic commando for any of you haven't played it You know, there's platformers and platformer was basically the primary genre of the original NES Because Super Mario Brothers and then everyone tried to make a game that was kind of like that.

404
00:25:08,584 --> 00:25:12,749
Speaker 0: now bionic commando was a platformer Except you couldn't jump.

405
00:25:13,695 --> 00:25:14,983
Speaker 0: There was no jumping in this game.

406
00:25:15,224 --> 00:25:15,667
Speaker 1: No jumping.

407
00:25:15,888 --> 00:25:21,364
Speaker 0: instead You had a grappling hook and this was an entirely new mode of play that created.

408
00:25:21,545 --> 00:25:21,926
Speaker 0: Awesome.

409
00:25:22,488 --> 00:25:22,828
Speaker 0: Awesome.

410
00:25:23,009 --> 00:25:26,349
Speaker 0: Awesome Awesome, I cannot express to you how much I love that game.

411
00:25:26,532 --> 00:25:38,168
Speaker 1: Yeah The variety of moves and different like platform situations that can occur in bionic commando is really crazy and like you always have to figure out exactly the right way to use it to avoid getting hit and make it over the whole.

412
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:43,310
Speaker 0: and Like if you've seen someone playing the game versus watching say me play the game or someone else who's good.

413
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:45,340
Speaker 0: Normally the game you like you're very careful.

414
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,204
Speaker 0: You're trying not to get hit.

415
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:47,028
Speaker 0: you die all the time.

416
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:50,950
Speaker 0: Watching someone who's good at that game play that game is like watching a ballerina.

417
00:25:51,731 --> 00:25:53,930
Speaker 0: Did you're flipping yourself through the air catching things?

418
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:58,229
Speaker 0: You didn't even know you could catch flying around all over the place dodging bullets by the skin of your teeth.

419
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:12,981
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mega Man 2 is really a game where you know, if you suck which I did back in those ancient times You know, you gradually improve your skills and it hones you into being the you know A master until what you cannot play Mega Man 2 better in any way.

420
00:26:13,182 --> 00:26:15,430
Speaker 0: the learning curve on bionic commando is a brick wall.

421
00:26:15,571 --> 00:26:17,701
Speaker 1: Yeah, bionic commando is like this brick wall.

422
00:26:17,741 --> 00:26:23,543
Speaker 1: But once you mount the brick wall It's like this amazing amazingness of crazy like it took.

423
00:26:23,644 --> 00:26:25,510
Speaker 1: limit is so high to what you can do.

424
00:26:25,651 --> 00:26:34,973
Speaker 0: It took me I think three or four months from when I first got the game Until I could get past the first half of the game because the game culminates in level 6.

425
00:26:34,973 --> 00:26:36,240
Speaker 0: Level 6 is like the.

426
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:37,930
Speaker 0: this is the trial by fire.

427
00:26:38,111 --> 00:26:40,741
Speaker 0: If you can beat this will let you play the rest of the game.

428
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:50,368
Speaker 0: and let me tell you the first day I beat level 6 I ran around my house screaming I couldn't believe it and then I learned that the rest of the game was twice as hard as level 6.

429
00:26:50,368 --> 00:26:55,050
Speaker 0: Wow Of course bionic commando is also the game where at the end you kill a naked Hitler.

430
00:26:56,051 --> 00:27:00,448
Speaker 0: yep, Hitler appears and he's naked and he says the word damn which oh.

431
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:02,725
Speaker 0: And then you kill him.

432
00:27:03,411 --> 00:27:12,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, Mega Man 2 I beat it like downstairs in my living room my brother watching and we were like, oh I think it took me two tries once I finally got to the alien guy at the end.

433
00:27:12,869 --> 00:27:12,950
Speaker 1: man.

434
00:27:12,970 --> 00:27:15,090
Speaker 0: Remember those days when when you got close to beating a game?

435
00:27:15,170 --> 00:27:20,456
Speaker 0: You'd call your friend or your brother and they come and watch to kind of verify your victory The first time I beat Zelda 1.

436
00:27:20,456 --> 00:27:26,516
Speaker 1: I did it using I think only the silver arrow in front of like a bunch of friends My brother in my room.

437
00:27:26,997 --> 00:27:27,940
Speaker 1: That was a crazy day.

438
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,590
Speaker 1: I remember it actually very clearly like it's crazy.

439
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:35,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember the first time I beat Final Fantasy 1.

440
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:44,145
Speaker 0: I screamed and my brother runs into the room and all the Texas flying by and We sat there just staring at the screen like wow, it's over.

441
00:27:44,165 --> 00:27:46,835
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, Zelda 1.

442
00:27:46,835 --> 00:27:47,878
Speaker 1: I would like.

443
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,450
Speaker 1: if you would have asked me ten years ago Zelda 1 would have been my favorite game.

444
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:52,193
Speaker 1: The problem was all.

445
00:27:52,213 --> 00:27:59,659
Speaker 1: the one is that when you're a little kid and you have that like, you know Wonder and whatnot and you'll burn every bush.

446
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:03,950
Speaker 1: You've never played Zelda 1 before you know, and you don't know everything already.

447
00:28:04,411 --> 00:28:13,985
Speaker 1: it's so fantastic the exploring and the figuring things out and the going from level to level and Levels in any order and collecting different items and using one different things.

448
00:28:14,005 --> 00:28:15,390
Speaker 0: I don't have time for that shit anymore.

449
00:28:15,913 --> 00:28:17,038
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was so great.

450
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,370
Speaker 1: But nowadays it's it's not so great anymore.

451
00:28:19,450 --> 00:28:23,465
Speaker 1: I just I can beat Zelda 1 in like 40 minutes, you know, so it's kind of like.

452
00:28:23,807 --> 00:28:29,651
Speaker 0: and now it's just yeah And there are games that are as good and are very similar, but I just don't have the time to sit there and burn every Bush.

453
00:28:29,912 --> 00:28:41,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean the first time I beat Zelda 1 like when I finally got to level 9 I was like scared shitless with that music and I didn't know where to go and it was like, oh Yeah, but nowadays it's like doo doo doo doo.

454
00:28:41,924 --> 00:28:44,559
Speaker 1: Let's go begin and there he is He's dead.

455
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:45,250
Speaker 1: I got the princess.

456
00:28:46,311 --> 00:28:46,653
Speaker 0: It's weird.

457
00:28:46,674 --> 00:28:47,579
Speaker 0: I remember as a little kid.

458
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,377
Speaker 0: I would actually get scared Endangerous parts.

459
00:28:50,457 --> 00:28:52,350
Speaker 1: Oh, I was super scared in Zelda 1.

460
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:53,675
Speaker 0: Holy shit Simon's quest.

461
00:28:53,776 --> 00:29:00,189
Speaker 0: when I got to that because at the end of Simon's quest which Simon's quest is right up there in my Opinion that's my favorite Castlevania game ever.

462
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:04,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, I like Castlevania 1 the most but I'm not really the hugest Castlevania fan.

463
00:29:04,807 --> 00:29:06,896
Speaker 0: So yeah I just really like Simon's quest.

464
00:29:06,916 --> 00:29:25,610
Speaker 0: that game scared the hell out of me when I was a kid mainly because the game is poorly Translated right and you'll find these cryptic things around like you'll find a bunch of people just hung to death in the background And then you'll find like a cryptic poorly translated text that as a little kid It just kind of scares you know at the end of the game you walk into Dracula's castle, right?

465
00:29:25,830 --> 00:29:27,018
Speaker 0: But Dracula's already dead.

466
00:29:27,461 --> 00:29:28,810
Speaker 0: So the music changes.

467
00:29:28,890 --> 00:29:32,272
Speaker 0: It's the scary music and it's this long long Castle.

468
00:29:32,292 --> 00:29:35,770
Speaker 0: you have to walk all the way through it and up and down ladders and stairs and whatever.

469
00:29:36,592 --> 00:29:37,400
Speaker 0: There's no monsters.

470
00:29:37,864 --> 00:29:38,510
Speaker 0: There's no nothing.

471
00:29:38,891 --> 00:29:44,769
Speaker 0: There's nothing in the castle, but you have to walk through it and I was scared shitless that something was gonna jump out at me.

472
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:48,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna talk about the scariest games legacy.

473
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:51,709
Speaker 1: the wizard might be the scariest but that was just me.

474
00:29:52,311 --> 00:29:57,848
Speaker 1: It was just so strange and sort of eerie and the way the game was and the music combined.

475
00:29:57,888 --> 00:29:58,049
Speaker 1: It was.

476
00:29:59,452 --> 00:30:09,470
Speaker 1: It's like you're a little tiny guy and the game is all sort of cute and happy But you're going down and down and down to this dark scary crazy dungeon and it gets scarier and darker the more down you go.

477
00:30:09,892 --> 00:30:12,988
Speaker 1: It's like you're going all over these weird places and only certain people go.

478
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:15,216
Speaker 1: Oh god Play the game sometime.

479
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't like it that much just because I don't have patience for games like that.

480
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,595
Speaker 0: But it's a game.

481
00:30:19,977 --> 00:30:20,661
Speaker 0: I just respect it.

482
00:30:20,862 --> 00:30:27,167
Speaker 1: I just wish that like some of these games are experienced different based on your state of mind and level of skill.

483
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:32,909
Speaker 1: and like Nowadays, you know with the person I am the game isn't as good as if I was the person I was.

484
00:30:33,912 --> 00:30:35,685
Speaker 0: You know, yeah, well our brains are different.

485
00:30:35,705 --> 00:30:36,450
Speaker 0: We've experienced more.

486
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,808
Speaker 0: I mean if Empire hunter D was a goddamn masterpiece when I was in fourth grade.

487
00:30:42,229 --> 00:30:45,170
Speaker 0: now It's just a mediocre guy killing things bloodily.

488
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:50,050
Speaker 1: It's like when you're a 20th level fighter a kobold is nothing but when you're a first level fighter a kobold is great.

489
00:30:50,251 --> 00:30:52,481
Speaker 1: I just sometimes I'm like a 20th level fire.

490
00:30:52,521 --> 00:30:54,370
Speaker 1: We are wishing I was a first level fighter.

491
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:59,288
Speaker 0: So if you experience the joy of killing kobolds, we're Lena inverse and we already killed chevron igdo.

492
00:30:59,508 --> 00:31:02,459
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, we're watching slayers.

493
00:31:02,881 --> 00:31:03,163
Speaker 1: Yeah.

494
00:31:03,485 --> 00:31:05,252
Speaker 1: Okay, so Let's see.

495
00:31:05,292 --> 00:31:08,124
Speaker 0: All right Friday the 13th used to scare the hell out of me when I was a kid.

496
00:31:08,144 --> 00:31:11,679
Speaker 0: Yeah the game No, not the movies.

497
00:31:11,699 --> 00:31:13,105
Speaker 1: the game no, none of the nut.

498
00:31:13,125 --> 00:31:14,210
Speaker 1: that really didn't get me anything.

499
00:31:15,831 --> 00:31:18,157
Speaker 1: Alright, let's talk about some PC games.

500
00:31:18,277 --> 00:31:25,976
Speaker 0: Alright, I'd have to say my favorite PC game ever ever ever ever would have to be Quake 2 not tie fighter.

501
00:31:25,996 --> 00:31:27,140
Speaker 0: I don't see type.

502
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:30,229
Speaker 0: Alright best single-player game ever hands-down tie fighter.

503
00:31:30,811 --> 00:31:34,406
Speaker 0: Best multiplayer game ever hands-down Quake 2 and all the associated mods.

504
00:31:34,707 --> 00:31:34,928
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

505
00:31:35,731 --> 00:31:40,430
Speaker 0: So, uh, let's start with single-player first since we've been talking mostly about single-player old-school type games.

506
00:31:40,852 --> 00:31:41,997
Speaker 1: Oh single-player is tough.

507
00:31:42,258 --> 00:31:55,559
Speaker 1: It might be met warrior - It might be One or half-life - Oh half-life one might be civilization - ooh It's a tough call especially if you're gonna keep it to only PC.

508
00:31:55,579 --> 00:31:57,385
Speaker 0: I have to go with tie fighter.

509
00:31:57,505 --> 00:32:00,550
Speaker 0: that game Destroyed my life.

510
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:02,197
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't play tie fighter that much.

511
00:32:02,258 --> 00:32:13,723
Speaker 0: That's why you know, I played it all the way through Beat it and then went all the way through again like destroying everything like I flew around destroying Entire like fleets with my one tie fighter.

512
00:32:13,924 --> 00:32:15,189
Speaker 0: I got that good in that board.

513
00:32:16,190 --> 00:32:21,530
Speaker 1: Huh if I had to think of which ones like, you know had the most effect on me, especially back in the day.

514
00:32:21,570 --> 00:32:21,811
Speaker 1: It's go.

515
00:32:21,831 --> 00:32:24,159
Speaker 1: you met courier - I mean damn.

516
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:33,350
Speaker 1: you had these missions and there was a story that you keep track of and you Customize the max and the missions are complex and it was a complex simulation of a giant robot and you're shooting guys.

517
00:32:34,115 --> 00:32:36,309
Speaker 1: It's better than any other mech game that's ever been around.

518
00:32:37,013 --> 00:32:40,809
Speaker 0: Well tie fighter is probably the best free space fighting game ever.

519
00:32:41,553 --> 00:32:44,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean basically descent - is also really good.

520
00:32:44,610 --> 00:32:48,590
Speaker 0: But it is really good, but it didn't have the Star Wars theme and high fighter was just so clean.

521
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:53,470
Speaker 0: I mean that the basic history here is that x-wing came out and it was an amazing game.

522
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:55,417
Speaker 0: It was fairly revolutionary is very well done.

523
00:32:55,437 --> 00:32:59,070
Speaker 0: It was hard as hell and it had a lot of rough edges.

524
00:33:00,152 --> 00:33:04,116
Speaker 0: So fast forward a few years and they made tie fighter Which is basically the same game.

525
00:33:04,196 --> 00:33:16,926
Speaker 0: only now you're on the bad guys side and they polished it a bit and by a bit I mean There was a time when PC gamer the ratings that they gave to games mattered Like they were fairly objective and if they said a game was good.

526
00:33:16,946 --> 00:33:25,323
Speaker 0: It was good they gave tie fighter the highest rating they had ever given a game and Then a few years later a game beat tie fighter.

527
00:33:25,644 --> 00:33:26,930
Speaker 0: You know what game beat tie fighter?

528
00:33:27,871 --> 00:33:29,819
Speaker 0: Tie fighter on a CD.

529
00:33:29,940 --> 00:33:31,527
Speaker 0: It was the same game just re-released.

530
00:33:31,687 --> 00:33:40,830
Speaker 0: And yeah, I Remember that tie fighter which is so well done because on one hand you're a tie fighter pilot and you gotta you know Fight the rebels and the fighting was really good.

531
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:46,430
Speaker 0: The missions were really good at primary and secondary objectives and you only had to do the primary objectives to continue.

532
00:33:46,792 --> 00:33:50,649
Speaker 0: The secondary ones were just for fun or to prove how badass you were to unlock the story.

533
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:58,554
Speaker 0: there were also these secret missions where you could basically become a spy for the Emperor and Do crazy stuff in the game.

534
00:33:58,775 --> 00:34:03,226
Speaker 0: Oh, you'd get tattoos if you were good and the Emperor would give you powers.

535
00:34:03,246 --> 00:34:05,498
Speaker 0: I Love that game.

536
00:34:06,247 --> 00:34:18,094
Speaker 1: Yeah if I had to pick a single-player FPS to say that was like Ever, you know, it's really tough because half-life 1 was like such a great Freaking game.

537
00:34:18,315 --> 00:34:20,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, but half-life 2 single-player.

538
00:34:20,223 --> 00:34:22,110
Speaker 1: I had I can't deny that it was better.

539
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:22,952
Speaker 1: I mean, it's just.

540
00:34:23,474 --> 00:34:28,467
Speaker 1: uh, I hate naming recent games because I like to be old-school but half-life 2 has to be it.

541
00:34:29,272 --> 00:34:30,277
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't played it yet.

542
00:34:30,297 --> 00:34:32,592
Speaker 0: So I can't say oh my god I can't.

543
00:34:32,773 --> 00:34:36,848
Speaker 0: I can't pretend that quake 2 is a good FPS single-player wise because it's half-life 2 had.

544
00:34:36,888 --> 00:34:42,395
Speaker 1: all the Feelings of half-life 1 are like, you know, you're in danger You're short on resources.

545
00:34:42,435 --> 00:34:43,178
Speaker 1: You're running around.

546
00:34:43,217 --> 00:34:46,549
Speaker 1: the story is is you know combined with the action?

547
00:34:47,150 --> 00:34:51,663
Speaker 1: solidly and You know you feel you you're you in.

548
00:34:51,683 --> 00:34:53,130
Speaker 1: most FPS is like in Wolfenstein.

549
00:34:53,251 --> 00:34:55,590
Speaker 1: I don't feel like I'm the Nazi prisoner trying to escape.

550
00:34:55,851 --> 00:34:58,770
Speaker 1: I feel like just a crazy guy trying to kill all Nazis in doom.

551
00:34:58,851 --> 00:35:00,769
Speaker 1: I don't feel like I'm the doom guy stuck on Mars.

552
00:35:00,971 --> 00:35:02,978
Speaker 1: I feel like I'm just gonna kill all his demons.

553
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,210
Speaker 1: when half-life you feel like you're Gordon Freeman, you know.

554
00:35:06,250 --> 00:35:10,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I poo-pooed it because I didn't play the game until much later like well after it had come out.

555
00:35:11,192 --> 00:35:14,044
Speaker 0: In fact, I only bought it because I wanted to play counter-strike.

556
00:35:14,125 --> 00:35:15,370
Speaker 1: You'll talk about kind of strike in a minute.

557
00:35:15,651 --> 00:35:30,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, but as I played through half-life 1 as a cynical like yeah Whatever this game and after about the first hour of playing it and I've got you know I've progressed through the game for a while I was Gordon Freeman and I was scared shitless that the military is gonna come and kill me.

558
00:35:30,771 --> 00:35:35,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, half-life 2 is just that and more like parts of the game aren't as good as other parts.

559
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:37,296
Speaker 1: But yeah, just wow.

560
00:35:37,738 --> 00:35:38,240
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

561
00:35:38,401 --> 00:35:40,310
Speaker 1: You haven't played half-life 2 the single-player.

562
00:35:41,038 --> 00:35:48,449
Speaker 0: damn Now if we're talking multiplayer Honestly, I love natural selection and I love counter-strike.

563
00:35:48,469 --> 00:35:51,550
Speaker 0: and We're not gonna talk about tribes - we'll do a whole show.

564
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:55,142
Speaker 0: I was gonna talk about tribes - tribes - is the best game ever.

565
00:35:55,282 --> 00:35:55,804
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

566
00:35:55,824 --> 00:35:57,650
Speaker 1: You just can't play just doesn't exist anymore.

567
00:35:57,751 --> 00:35:58,438
Speaker 1: It's the problem.

568
00:35:58,579 --> 00:35:59,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, whiners ruined it.

569
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:02,781
Speaker 1: It's like you can still play Megaman - you can still play half-life.

570
00:36:02,801 --> 00:36:06,776
Speaker 0: - you can't play tribes - actually There are some servers out there.

571
00:36:07,038 --> 00:36:08,766
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not the same as it was.

572
00:36:08,786 --> 00:36:09,530
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

573
00:36:10,172 --> 00:36:13,444
Speaker 0: I'd like to do a whole show on tribes - I got tribes - the day came out.

574
00:36:13,644 --> 00:36:15,190
Speaker 1: rim ordered it for me online.

575
00:36:15,311 --> 00:36:16,142
Speaker 1: It was in college.

576
00:36:16,162 --> 00:36:16,790
Speaker 1: We had two copies.

577
00:36:16,891 --> 00:36:23,268
Speaker 1: I played it online and The first day that game came out and all those people were playing on a server with like 50 people.

578
00:36:23,308 --> 00:36:24,793
Speaker 1: with my wicked Low-paying.

579
00:36:25,114 --> 00:36:28,343
Speaker 1: that was like the greatest FPS team action ever.

580
00:36:28,383 --> 00:36:31,772
Speaker 0: We walked around the campus for the next week going Pretending.

581
00:36:31,792 --> 00:36:35,909
Speaker 0: we had jetpacks like tribes - all our friends thought we were idiots and then they all bought the game.

582
00:36:36,572 --> 00:36:40,809
Speaker 1: God tribes - is just so freaking terrific multiplayer game.

583
00:36:40,890 --> 00:36:44,850
Speaker 0: We would come home from class and just start playing like I'd come home and start playing.

584
00:36:45,171 --> 00:36:46,819
Speaker 0: Scott would come home from class and start playing.

585
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,169
Speaker 0: I look up at the clock and turn the game off and go to class.

586
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:51,558
Speaker 0: then I'd come back and start playing again and he'd still be playing.

587
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:52,180
Speaker 1: Yep.

588
00:36:52,843 --> 00:36:54,830
Speaker 1: The thing is you can't play tribes - anymore.

589
00:36:54,911 --> 00:36:59,719
Speaker 1: I mean, it's free now if you want to if you want to try it But it's just not the same as it was.

590
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:00,722
Speaker 1: there aren't enough people.

591
00:37:00,803 --> 00:37:02,730
Speaker 1: They don't play the same way they used to play.

592
00:37:02,992 --> 00:37:04,301
Speaker 1: It's just not the same now.

593
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:05,410
Speaker 0: I've got a crazy idea.

594
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:09,750
Speaker 1: I would pay a lot of money to bring tribes to back or get another game going.

595
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,590
Speaker 1: That was like just basically tribes - all right.

596
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:24,604
Speaker 0: so all of you out there who listen to geek nights if you either one liked tribes - or - might think you might like tribes - check it out and If enough of you want us to we'll put up some sort of server somewhere.

597
00:37:24,624 --> 00:37:24,764
Speaker 0: where?

598
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:26,069
Speaker 1: where are we gonna put up a server?

599
00:37:26,210 --> 00:37:26,451
Speaker 0: I don't know.

600
00:37:26,471 --> 00:37:27,294
Speaker 0: I'll get another hosting.

601
00:37:27,315 --> 00:37:28,680
Speaker 1: All right, it's all you.

602
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:36,547
Speaker 0: we'll do something because if enough of you want to play and We you know, we can play tribes - old school all the way with the original rule set.

603
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:40,685
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm That'd be fun, but I don't think it would be easy to get going.

604
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:41,870
Speaker 0: No, I don't think it would either.

605
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:42,695
Speaker 0: That's why I'm asking.

606
00:37:42,755 --> 00:37:43,238
Speaker 1: I'll tell you what.

607
00:37:43,278 --> 00:37:45,410
Speaker 1: go to the forum and we'll start it tribes to thread.

608
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:52,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, so we're not gonna tribes - is not in the consideration because it was the best game ever, but they ruined it.

609
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:53,355
Speaker 1: It's no longer playable.

610
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:56,590
Speaker 1: the game that it that was the best game ever does not exist now.

611
00:37:56,731 --> 00:37:59,230
Speaker 0: Like I said, I like that and counter-strike and natural selection.

612
00:37:59,632 --> 00:38:07,129
Speaker 0: But honestly, I spent more time in my life Playing quick - and all of its mods than I've played any other FPS ever.

613
00:38:07,893 --> 00:38:08,155
Speaker 1: Wow,

614
00:38:08,718 --> 00:38:28,609
Speaker 0: I mean I played quake - pretty much from the day It came out online and then lithium deathmatch and then a weapons factory action quake weapons of destruction action quake version - weapons or a weapons factory version - in fact I contend that weapons factory was better than any incarnation of Team Fortress ever.

615
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:32,289
Speaker 1: Well, Team Fortress is sort of this on and off sort of thing.

616
00:38:33,131 --> 00:38:36,025
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just I have so many good memories of playing that game.

617
00:38:36,045 --> 00:38:48,302
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, see when I first actually was able to play FPS is online for real was when I got to college because before then I had a little dial-up so I couldn't really play online so well.

618
00:38:48,402 --> 00:38:50,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you kind of missed a whole era there.

619
00:38:50,711 --> 00:38:57,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I played Team Fortress classic on the half-life engine and that was really not so great.

620
00:38:57,470 --> 00:39:01,370
Speaker 1: I mean it was better than anything I had previously played but it wasn't so great except for the hunted.

621
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:10,329
Speaker 1: The hunting was terrific the hunted if you don't know is basically Counter-strike assault with the VIP trying to get to a checkpoint and then they win but if the VIP dies they lose.

622
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:17,749
Speaker 1: Then some guys are talking about counter-strike and they said oh if you die, you're out and I'm like, oh that sucks I don't want to play something like that.

623
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:23,268
Speaker 1: But then I realized oh you're out for the round and there's an objective and it's quick and I got it.

624
00:39:23,991 --> 00:39:27,970
Speaker 1: Then I played counter-strike probably more than I played any other multiplayer FPS ever.

625
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:37,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got really into counter-strike starting right around beta 5, I believe Yeah, the thing is counter-strike like any other multiplayer FPS or really any other multiplayer round based game.

626
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:44,790
Speaker 1: You can have good rounds and bad rounds, you know It could be painful to play or it could be like the best time you've had playing counter-strike ever.

627
00:39:45,051 --> 00:39:46,434
Speaker 0: We've had some crazy times.

628
00:39:46,755 --> 00:39:53,470
Speaker 1: crazy times, you know when crazy stuff happenings or when your team just clicks and yeah It feels really good.

629
00:39:53,651 --> 00:40:00,270
Speaker 0: Like say you you're the defenders and you're trying to defend the bombsite and you get owned like 20 times in a row.

630
00:40:00,391 --> 00:40:13,512
Speaker 0: They just they run in and they destroy you and then that one time Somehow your team just goes nuts and kills the entire enemy team without taking a loss and the whole server is going WTF WTF hacks or That's like.

631
00:40:13,552 --> 00:40:14,415
Speaker 0: that's that's gold.

632
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:19,350
Speaker 1: That's always chat actually hurt counter-strike a little bit, you know, yeah, it helped and hurt.

633
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:24,734
Speaker 1: I mean, I think it made the game different and a lot of the end and a lot of the changes to the engine and Stuff change things.

634
00:40:24,774 --> 00:40:26,359
Speaker 0: Well, the game was often broken.

635
00:40:26,479 --> 00:40:29,670
Speaker 1: I mean was often broken, but sometimes when it was broken it was more fun.

636
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:31,558
Speaker 0: Yeah, except when they first introduced the p90.

637
00:40:31,699 --> 00:40:34,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was basically a death machine.

638
00:40:34,792 --> 00:40:38,445
Speaker 1: I remember a time when there was no cheating like way early on.

639
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:41,577
Speaker 0: Yeah, all you kids out there Yeah, people used to not cheat.

640
00:40:41,638 --> 00:40:44,510
Speaker 1: when you play counter-strike beta 7 there was no cheating.

641
00:40:45,232 --> 00:40:45,773
Speaker 1: They just didn't.

642
00:40:45,994 --> 00:40:47,057
Speaker 1: you'd no one cheated.

643
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:50,186
Speaker 1: they were just people were good and everyone got about.

644
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:51,570
Speaker 1: you know, pretty good scores.

645
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,229
Speaker 1: That was the times.

646
00:40:53,918 --> 00:41:01,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, well see Scott I'll just point out you know that there's an entire era of FPS gaming way before that when I was in high school.

647
00:41:01,931 --> 00:41:02,173
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

648
00:41:02,456 --> 00:41:03,990
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, cuz thing is I was really lucky.

649
00:41:04,111 --> 00:41:06,230
Speaker 0: I can't pretend that this was because I was awesome.

650
00:41:06,591 --> 00:41:08,277
Speaker 0: It was just luck of where I happen to live.

651
00:41:08,718 --> 00:41:16,770
Speaker 0: But basically I had broadband since I was a freshman in high school Like we got some of the first broadband connections in the state of Michigan.

652
00:41:17,291 --> 00:41:21,142
Speaker 0: So basically me and my friend we got cable modems because we begged our parents.

653
00:41:21,544 --> 00:41:25,277
Speaker 0: It was like 50 bucks a month and I got pings of like 20.

654
00:41:25,277 --> 00:41:26,322
Speaker 0: I mean people.

655
00:41:27,025 --> 00:41:27,970
Speaker 0: no one knew what to make of it.

656
00:41:27,990 --> 00:41:33,825
Speaker 0: I connect to a server and I have a ping of like, you know 20 25 and most people had dial-up and pings of like three or four hundred.

657
00:41:34,427 --> 00:41:38,882
Speaker 0: and back then High ping meant death because ping was not dealt with at all.

658
00:41:39,143 --> 00:41:41,269
Speaker 0: You just lagged that far behind in the game.

659
00:41:42,731 --> 00:41:50,133
Speaker 0: But I played quake 2 weapons factory like religiously and Once again, no one cheated.

660
00:41:50,173 --> 00:41:50,294
Speaker 0: like.

661
00:41:50,314 --> 00:41:52,720
Speaker 0: the idea of cheating back then was just unheard of.

662
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:55,402
Speaker 0: The thing is it was difficult to play.

663
00:41:55,503 --> 00:42:01,203
Speaker 0: FPS is back then like, you know You play I don't quake 3 or whatever doom 3 and you can just bind keys to whatever.

664
00:42:01,725 --> 00:42:03,330
Speaker 0: back then you couldn't do anything.

665
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:11,150
Speaker 0: You had to write scripts to take care of your key bindings at all times like complex difficult to manage scripts to make the game work.

666
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:14,762
Speaker 1: Yeah scripts that you really weren't supposed to have to write ever.

667
00:42:14,782 --> 00:42:15,465
Speaker 1: Yeah.

668
00:42:15,686 --> 00:42:18,242
Speaker 0: I'm not saying that was good I'm just saying that's the way it was.

669
00:42:18,262 --> 00:42:19,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is definitely I still have.

670
00:42:20,233 --> 00:42:31,068
Speaker 0: I had a keyboard that I used all the way through our IT till it finally died that had all the all This marker writing over it as to what was bound to what key for different classes and I had scripts to go along with that keyboard.

671
00:42:32,714 --> 00:42:34,860
Speaker 1: So now I'm also gonna mention natural selection.

672
00:42:35,101 --> 00:42:39,457
Speaker 1: natural selection is a half-life 1 mod where it's kind of like an RTS Alien vs.

673
00:42:39,538 --> 00:42:40,930
Speaker 1: Predator also FPS.

674
00:42:41,311 --> 00:42:47,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, imagine RTS where one guy's the commander and he's doling out troops and whatever but all the troops are guys playing an FPS.

675
00:42:47,811 --> 00:42:47,935
Speaker 0: Yeah

676
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:58,950
Speaker 1: the thing about natural selection is that if you gave me a choice between a really good game of natural selection and a really Good game of counter-strike the game of natural selection probably more fun and more awesome

677
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,157
Speaker 0: Mostly because of the community around it the

678
00:43:01,217 --> 00:43:05,230
Speaker 1: problem with well and because the game itself I think is just inherently.

679
00:43:05,412 --> 00:43:07,088
Speaker 0: I think the communities were really did it for me?

680
00:43:07,931 --> 00:43:14,192
Speaker 1: but the thing about natural selection is it's so much harder to get a good game of natural selection than it is to get a Game of counter-strike.

681
00:43:14,212 --> 00:43:23,700
Speaker 1: and I just because there are fewer players because it requires so much more effort and coordination and like one Asshole can ruin it one asshole can ruin it.

682
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:29,350
Speaker 1: in counter-strike one asshole just dies every round You know or he team kills and then he dies the next round.

683
00:43:29,430 --> 00:43:31,604
Speaker 0: Yeah That's one thing counter-strike never had.

684
00:43:31,665 --> 00:43:36,830
Speaker 0: was that Deeply rooted sense of community which may sound silly for a video game, but I swear to you it was there.

685
00:43:37,215 --> 00:43:38,170
Speaker 0: I mean natural selection.

686
00:43:38,752 --> 00:43:43,088
Speaker 0: It was a small group so you'd see the same people over and over and you'd start to learn who was who.

687
00:43:43,169 --> 00:43:46,719
Speaker 0: and you'd see A guy and you know that guy always plays bender waves whenever he does.

688
00:43:46,779 --> 00:43:57,062
Speaker 0: Well, everyone just called him bender or that guy sucks and you'd know like you'd know the guy and your friends with him, but you just know we sucked from his name and In the old old days.

689
00:43:57,082 --> 00:43:57,790
Speaker 0: It was the same way.

690
00:43:57,871 --> 00:44:02,769
Speaker 0: everyone kind of knew each other and Everyone was kind of cool with each other and they talked outside of the game and you know who was who?

691
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:05,198
Speaker 0: You don't really have that in counter-strike.

692
00:44:05,841 --> 00:44:07,590
Speaker 0: You just play with random schmucks constantly.

693
00:44:08,331 --> 00:44:10,821
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like sometimes I feel like I should go get.

694
00:44:10,941 --> 00:44:13,190
Speaker 1: one of these newfangled FPS is like the battlefield.

695
00:44:13,270 --> 00:44:22,830
Speaker 1: There's something like that and you know get some people together with like a clan of non Schmucks and really try to turn it into what it was in the old days, but it's so much effort.

696
00:44:22,951 --> 00:44:26,589
Speaker 1: It's not the same and I'd had to buy a better computer and it's just you know.

697
00:44:27,231 --> 00:44:27,492
Speaker 1: I don't know.

698
00:44:27,512 --> 00:44:30,842
Speaker 1: It's just so much trying just to get something that came easily before.

699
00:44:30,862 --> 00:44:32,005
Speaker 1: I don't want to.

700
00:44:32,205 --> 00:44:33,790
Speaker 1: I'd feel bad doing that.

701
00:44:34,053 --> 00:44:35,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean natural selection.

702
00:44:35,651 --> 00:44:39,950
Speaker 0: I remember one of the defining moments for us was a game ended and I forget who had won.

703
00:44:40,291 --> 00:44:54,570
Speaker 0: but we're back in the team room, which is the the start room where basically everyone gets together and then you pick what team you want to be on whatever and everyone's standing there waiting for the next round to start and Everyone just started dancing and raving and playing music into the microphone and flashing their flashlights.

704
00:44:55,152 --> 00:45:00,370
Speaker 0: And then in this room, don't ask me why there was a table and on table was a piece of cheese.

705
00:45:00,612 --> 00:45:01,949
Speaker 1: I was gonna talk about the cheese.

706
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:03,318
Speaker 0: All right, fine.

707
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:04,250
Speaker 0: You can talk about the cheese.

708
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:08,270
Speaker 1: There's a piece of cheese on the table and some guy says let's pile on the cheese.

709
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:16,399
Speaker 1: He gets on top of the cheese a guy gets on top of him a guy gets on top of him and everyone's jumping up and down on top of the Cheese in a giant pyramid of people meanwhile and aliens.

710
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:19,770
Speaker 0: one guy goes into the game to try to start and he comes back out.

711
00:45:19,810 --> 00:45:21,177
Speaker 0: He's like and he sees the pile.

712
00:45:21,197 --> 00:45:23,730
Speaker 0: He's like what WTF are you guys doing?

713
00:45:24,351 --> 00:45:25,418
Speaker 0: Don't you want to play the game?

714
00:45:25,458 --> 00:45:27,210
Speaker 0: and we're like forget you cheese.

715
00:45:29,511 --> 00:45:36,225
Speaker 0: What kind of game can you have where everyone is more interested in hanging out with each other and piling up on cheese than they Aren't actually playing the game?

716
00:45:36,286 --> 00:45:43,850
Speaker 1: one time I joined an NS server and there's one alien and he was playing Techno music and dancing around the ready room and he was all alone.

717
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:44,755
Speaker 1: Everyone else is playing.

718
00:45:45,298 --> 00:45:47,590
Speaker 1: so I went into the game for a minute and the game was kind of bleh.

719
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:54,013
Speaker 1: So I'm back to the ready room and started dance around and bit by bit more people started going to the ready room as people Leaving the game.

720
00:45:54,033 --> 00:46:00,436
Speaker 1: where the game ended people came to the ready room and started the techno with us and then after we've done technically We started a real game.

721
00:46:00,476 --> 00:46:01,843
Speaker 1: That was actually good now.

722
00:46:01,903 --> 00:46:03,250
Speaker 0: We don't really have a category for this.

723
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:10,389
Speaker 0: I mean, it's in the bimani category, but dance dance revolution has affected us in profound ways.

724
00:46:12,031 --> 00:46:13,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, I should get back into that.

725
00:46:14,138 --> 00:46:14,479
Speaker 0: Yeah.

726
00:46:14,760 --> 00:46:15,081
Speaker 0: Yeah.

727
00:46:15,382 --> 00:46:17,409
Speaker 0: I mean basically we'd never heard a DDR.

728
00:46:18,012 --> 00:46:19,597
Speaker 0: We had no idea about it.

729
00:46:19,638 --> 00:46:27,910
Speaker 0: and we get to RIT and this guy has this dance man And he's dancing and there's arrows on the screen and that looked like the dumbest thing in the world to me.

730
00:46:28,030 --> 00:46:29,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, we both said this is the dumbest thing ever.

731
00:46:30,482 --> 00:46:32,230
Speaker 1: It's like some little kids game or some shit.

732
00:46:32,454 --> 00:46:33,249
Speaker 1: I'm not doing this.

733
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:37,250
Speaker 0: So then Scott goes off to play Dungeons & Dragons with all these people, but I had nothing to do.

734
00:46:37,310 --> 00:46:38,054
Speaker 0: I wasn't in that game.

735
00:46:38,395 --> 00:46:40,204
Speaker 0: So I'd started trying to play this dancing game.

736
00:46:40,244 --> 00:46:41,048
Speaker 0: I had nothing better to do.

737
00:46:42,011 --> 00:46:51,244
Speaker 0: Four hours later they get out of their D&D game and I'm still dancing and Scott says something to the effect of what the hell that Game looked stupid and I just looked at him and said try it and see what you say

738
00:46:51,404 --> 00:46:53,712
Speaker 1: and I try anything once To make sure

739
00:46:54,033 --> 00:46:57,685
Speaker 0: and sure enough not too long after I got a ps1 modded.

740
00:46:57,765 --> 00:47:04,609
Speaker 0: it got the import games We bought dance mats we duct-taped them permanently to the floor in our apartment and we play DDR every day.

741
00:47:05,232 --> 00:47:10,231
Speaker 1: Yeah, the thing is DDR isn't what it used to be just like it seems like everything that's our favorite isn't what it used to Be?

742
00:47:10,873 --> 00:47:12,478
Speaker 0: yes that you know what that means.

743
00:47:12,578 --> 00:47:16,109
Speaker 0: It either means the world is changing or we're crotchety old men.

744
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:17,657
Speaker 1: now I think we're just crotchety.

745
00:47:17,838 --> 00:47:20,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we are because we used to be punk kids.

746
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:29,944
Speaker 1: The way we experienced these things when they were new and awesome or you know in our youth younger days Was the way they should be experienced and for the most awesome.

747
00:47:29,964 --> 00:47:33,599
Speaker 1: and the way we experienced them now Isn't the same as the way we experienced them then.

748
00:47:33,639 --> 00:47:36,150
Speaker 1: so we don't like him as much now as we did then.

749
00:47:36,291 --> 00:47:38,212
Speaker 0: Well consider this DDR.

750
00:47:38,272 --> 00:47:43,590
Speaker 0: we played it for years where we had dance mats in our apartment and that was and other than other people's apartments.

751
00:47:43,650 --> 00:47:47,808
Speaker 0: That was the only time I could ever play it and no one really was good at it because no one had it.

752
00:47:48,855 --> 00:47:56,173
Speaker 0: Then one day an Arcade machine appeared near us Like we'd always wanted an arcade machine we never even like.

753
00:47:56,313 --> 00:48:04,290
Speaker 0: once I'd seen an arcade machine at Cedar Point when I went back home to go on vacation with my family and One day our friend Scott Johnson calls us.

754
00:48:04,330 --> 00:48:19,170
Speaker 0: he says I heard there's a DDR machine at blah blah blah and we I just hung up because we were on our way to that place immediately and Our whole group of friends congregated at this arcade and like a shining altar in the middle of the room is a dance dance revolution.

755
00:48:19,351 --> 00:48:20,396
Speaker 0: Fourth mix machine.

756
00:48:20,778 --> 00:48:21,984
Speaker 1: fourth mix was where it was at.

757
00:48:22,305 --> 00:48:23,230
Speaker 0: We about cried.

758
00:48:23,511 --> 00:48:26,844
Speaker 0: I bought like $50 worth of tokens and I used them all.

759
00:48:26,965 --> 00:48:28,250
Speaker 1: that was the summer of dancing.

760
00:48:28,592 --> 00:48:30,970
Speaker 0: Yep, that was the summer of dancing in the summer of Puerto Rico.

761
00:48:31,251 --> 00:48:35,505
Speaker 1: Yep, we all we did that summer was dance dance revolution in Puerto Rico the board game.

Speaker 0: That was a good summer.

764
00:48:37,211 --> 00:48:43,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I mean it does this community and happiness and fun around that one machine was just so fantastic.

765
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:46,180
Speaker 0: Yep, like yeah, everyone knew everyone who played on the machine.

766
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:47,586
Speaker 0: Everyone's real polite to each other.

767
00:48:47,907 --> 00:48:48,650
Speaker 0: No one was a jerk.

768
00:48:49,071 --> 00:48:51,801
Speaker 0: Everyone was about the same level of skill.

769
00:48:51,861 --> 00:48:56,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, there weren't any like, you know Asians Get it out to be racist or anything.

Speaker 0: Kaya nub exactly.

772
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:04,424
Speaker 1: There were none of those guys doing like the crazy hard stuff Like who look at me I'm so much better and no smelly people.

773
00:49:04,504 --> 00:49:05,770
Speaker 0: and now there were smelly people.

774
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:08,683
Speaker 0: I think you're that's definitely a rose-tinted glass right there.

775
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:11,395
Speaker 0: It might be now I remember some smelly people.

776
00:49:11,415 --> 00:49:14,709
Speaker 0: All right, and there were the people who were really good, but they weren't jerks about it.

777
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:17,261
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they're not like good at that one time.

778
00:49:17,281 --> 00:49:19,129
Speaker 1: We tried to play in New York and they were jerks about it.

779
00:49:19,431 --> 00:49:20,435
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

780
00:49:20,898 --> 00:49:26,125
Speaker 0: Yeah, though the thing is there was a point at which we got really good But that was after you know a year of playing every day now.

781
00:49:26,145 --> 00:49:26,890
Speaker 1: We're not so good anymore.

782
00:49:27,292 --> 00:49:31,930
Speaker 0: No, I remember this one time we were playing in our apartment and we always play in our boxers or like shorts.

783
00:49:31,990 --> 00:49:37,490
Speaker 0: Just cuz you know you get hot playing DDR and it was summer and these drunks are standing outside.

784
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:38,930
Speaker 1: I have been like four or five times.

785
00:49:38,930 --> 00:49:45,078
Speaker 0: Yeah And they see us in there and they couldn't figure out what we were doing and they'd start gathering a crowd and they start yelling Or cheering.

786
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,069
Speaker 0: one guy mooned us.

787
00:49:47,051 --> 00:49:47,392
Speaker 1: Awesome.

788
00:49:47,674 --> 00:49:51,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, one time these drunk sorority girls wandered in and wanted to play with us.

789
00:49:51,190 --> 00:49:52,533
Speaker 1: I don't know why we didn't take advantage of them.

790
00:49:52,955 --> 00:49:55,581
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we were more interested in playing DDR at the time.

791
00:49:56,002 --> 00:49:56,925
Speaker 1: Yeah playing DDR.

792
00:49:56,945 --> 00:50:04,276
Speaker 0: I Don't know there's something about a drunk sorority girl who comes into your apartment Randomly and starts hitting on you.

793
00:50:04,316 --> 00:50:09,355
Speaker 0: that really kind of turns you off a little especially when they're not so hot More that they were so drunk.

794
00:50:09,415 --> 00:50:10,257
Speaker 0: It was not good.

795
00:50:10,497 --> 00:50:13,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they were really into DDR, I guess.

796
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:19,019
Speaker 0: Oh, well, yeah Now DDR, I mean DDR machines were so rare.

797
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:22,170
Speaker 0: and then suddenly there was an explosion and there were DDR machines everywhere.

798
00:50:22,792 --> 00:50:31,150
Speaker 0: and then that next summer we went to Wildwood, New Jersey with Scott Johnson our good friend and all of our other friends and There were like 10 DDR machines on the boardwalk.

799
00:50:32,015 --> 00:50:32,719
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there wasn't.

800
00:50:32,739 --> 00:50:41,612
Speaker 0: you didn't have the community around those DDR machine No But what you did have were slack-jawed tourists who had never seen anything like that before and no one knew how to dance on it Except us.

801
00:50:42,495 --> 00:50:45,484
Speaker 0: and they go ooh, and ah, yeah, that's a good feeling.

802
00:50:45,544 --> 00:50:49,190
Speaker 0: It's a silly feeling but it's a good feeling Yeah, but now it doesn't work anymore.

803
00:50:49,431 --> 00:50:55,747
Speaker 0: Now every machine there is an 8th mix machine and it's all these epic kaya nub kids playing DDR.

804
00:50:55,787 --> 00:51:00,558
Speaker 1: Yep Uh Why does everything have to go away?

805
00:51:00,598 --> 00:51:01,060
Speaker 1: That's good.

806
00:51:01,523 --> 00:51:02,950
Speaker 0: Why do we have to get old and crotchety?

807
00:51:03,290 --> 00:51:03,612
Speaker 1: I don't know.

808
00:51:04,076 --> 00:51:07,154
Speaker 0: I mean if we were young punk kids, we'd probably be talking up Whatever the new great thing is.

809
00:51:07,576 --> 00:51:07,817
Speaker 1: Yep.

810
00:51:08,479 --> 00:51:16,750
Speaker 0: The new great thing is in the groove - yep I consider it the spiritual successor to Dance Dance Revolution because DDR is basically dead as far as I'm concerned.

811
00:51:17,192 --> 00:51:20,122
Speaker 0: Yeah, well mostly because we can't find a fourth mix machine anywhere anymore.

812
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:22,130
Speaker 1: You mean a fourth mix plus machine?

813
00:51:22,453 --> 00:51:24,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, so it has the kpop songs.

814
00:51:24,432 --> 00:51:25,406
Speaker 1: There was a fourth mix.

815
00:51:25,507 --> 00:51:27,537
Speaker 1: well No The fourth mix has the kpop songs.

816
00:51:27,597 --> 00:51:30,308
Speaker 1: fourth mix plus has the extra mix type songs and such.

817
00:51:30,429 --> 00:51:33,565
Speaker 0: of course I have a special place in my heart for Dance Dance Revolution.

818
00:51:33,645 --> 00:51:34,470
Speaker 0: third mix Korean.

819
00:51:34,932 --> 00:51:37,342
Speaker 0: Yeah, because mainly there was a machine on the boardwalk.

820
00:51:37,563 --> 00:51:39,129
Speaker 0: It was a quarter for five songs.

821
00:51:40,052 --> 00:51:43,049
Speaker 0: Alright, once again, we could talk about this topic forever and we're gonna stop now.

Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I could talk about you know favorite RPG type games.

824
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:55,519
