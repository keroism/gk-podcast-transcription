1
00:00:08,060 --> 00:00:10,298
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, November 25th, 2020.

2
00:00:10,298 --> 00:00:10,720
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,999 --> 00:00:14,225
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:16,175
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights Tonight.

5
00:00:16,637 --> 00:00:20,730
Speaker 0: Adventure Time, Distant Lands, Episode 2, Obsidian.

6
00:00:22,012 --> 00:00:23,048
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:33,210
Speaker 0: You know, a consequence of these special post-ending Adventure Times coming out in this long format is we're kind of reviewing them like movies, even though they're really just long episodes.

8
00:00:34,992 --> 00:00:41,989
Speaker 1: I think we have to now, this is like the last one where we're gonna say we're gonna do a Geek Nights episode about each one, I think.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:42,787
Speaker 1: I don't know.

10
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:45,608
Speaker 1: Going forward, we should only do it about them if they're...

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,409
Speaker 0: There's only gonna be four, at least officially so far.

12
00:00:52,414 --> 00:00:54,229
Speaker 1: Let's hold and see if that remains true.

13
00:00:54,671 --> 00:00:57,409
Speaker 0: I bet they keep making them because they seem to be popular and they're really good.

14
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:06,721
Speaker 1: I don't feel like, you know, as much as we like it, we shouldn't dedicate a Geek Nights episode to every single episode of another thing because that's instead its own podcast.

15
00:01:06,741 --> 00:01:08,350
Speaker 1: That's no longer, right?

16
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:15,949
Speaker 1: We don't want Wednesday night to become so focused onto a single thing that so many of the episodes are about one thing.

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,389
Speaker 0: Well, we should pick what anime we're gonna watch before the next Wednesday episode then.

18
00:01:22,714 --> 00:01:24,850
Speaker 0: I kind of want to watch Sleepy Princess in the Castle.

19
00:01:26,915 --> 00:01:28,130
Speaker 1: Is that available somewhere?

20
00:01:28,391 --> 00:01:34,210
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I'll figure out where it's available because it looks really funny and people I trust have been saying that it's hilarious and not creepy.

21
00:01:37,172 --> 00:01:38,561
Speaker 0: So I actually have an obi-bit.

22
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:39,648
Speaker 0: Something happened to me.

23
00:01:41,091 --> 00:01:43,230
Speaker 1: How did something happen to you in your house?

24
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:46,490
Speaker 0: So a package came and it was a big package.

25
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:49,386
Speaker 0: I wasn't expecting a package, like, in particular.

26
00:01:49,406 --> 00:01:50,090
Speaker 0: It was really big.

27
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,330
Speaker 1: Is it another free monitor?

28
00:01:54,174 --> 00:01:56,548
Speaker 0: It was not, in fact, a bomb like last time.

29
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:00,221
Speaker 0: So I opened it and it was my Valve Index.

30
00:02:00,241 --> 00:02:02,530
Speaker 0: It actually arrived way sooner than I expected.

31
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:07,410
Speaker 1: Well, usually I think that happens a lot is when you are buying expensive things.

32
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:10,789
Speaker 1: They tend to, like, include... This is so expensive, right?

33
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:17,950
Speaker 1: They want to make sure it shows up, so they will just include the expensive, timely, you know, better shipping option.

34
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:22,570
Speaker 0: It was in, like, this really fancy box layered in another fancy box.

35
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:33,027
Speaker 1: Anytime I've ever ordered anything from Apple, any phone or iPad, it's always shown up immediately at the exact right time on the day that it was supposed to, right?

36
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:34,969
Speaker 1: You know, the same kind of thing.

37
00:02:35,350 --> 00:02:35,410
Speaker 0: Yep.

38
00:02:35,591 --> 00:02:47,769
Speaker 0: Now I'll say already, if someone... I'll geek bite this or review it on a Monday or Wednesday show or Tuesday show, but this is not a VR kit you should buy unless you are deep into VR.

39
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,070
Speaker 0: This is literally the best consumer technology that exists.

40
00:02:52,871 --> 00:02:58,770
Speaker 1: It could be that you're just wealthy and you have a bunch of random stuff that you use a little bit each, but you don't care because you're a wealthy jerk.

41
00:02:59,110 --> 00:03:02,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you're like that, just get the freaking Oculus for, like, 300 bucks instead.

42
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:05,481
Speaker 0: Like, this won't work with the Oculus store.

43
00:03:05,522 --> 00:03:06,930
Speaker 0: This only works with Valve.

44
00:03:07,111 --> 00:03:07,534
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

45
00:03:07,554 --> 00:03:10,090
Speaker 1: You know those wealthy people, they got to measure their dicks, right?

46
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:15,456
Speaker 1: And got to be like, "Oh, not only do I have... I have all these things that I barely use and I have the best of each one.

47
00:03:15,476 --> 00:03:18,664
Speaker 1: Look, I have the best pool table in the world that is used maybe once every two

48
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:18,929
Speaker 1: years.".

49
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,586
Speaker 0: No, because if you're wealthy, you don't get the index.

50
00:03:21,606 --> 00:03:22,250
Speaker 0: You know what you get?

51
00:03:22,331 --> 00:03:23,288
Speaker 0: You get installation VR.

52
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:29,328
Speaker 0: This is the best consumer retail with an MSRP VR kit.

53
00:03:29,368 --> 00:03:29,930
Speaker 0: that's out there.

54
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:31,499
Speaker 0: There is better VR.

55
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:33,070
Speaker 0: There's a lot of better VR.

56
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,450
Speaker 0: But that's the special VR you have to, like, buy directly with an invoice.

57
00:03:38,732 --> 00:03:39,921
Speaker 0: Get someone to install it.

58
00:03:40,304 --> 00:03:40,969
Speaker 0: Special sensors.

59
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:44,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like getting software for that would be hard.

60
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:48,890
Speaker 1: Usually that's the kind of setup you have in academia where you're developing software for it.

61
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,848
Speaker 1: I don't think you're going to be like, "Buy a game on Steam and run it on

62
00:03:51,888 --> 00:03:52,049
Speaker 1: that.".

63
00:03:53,353 --> 00:03:55,630
Speaker 0: Some of those, yeah, you kind of can just do that.

64
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:03,790
Speaker 0: Steam is actually really good at just seeing VR tech, even mixing and matching VR tech from different vendors.

65
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:05,509
Speaker 0: And it kind of just works.

66
00:04:06,671 --> 00:04:07,070
Speaker 1: Pretty good job.

67
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:11,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, like, surprisingly, that is not what I would expect from the same people who made the Steam controller.

68
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:17,450
Speaker 1: So, like, you would be wearing an index face but then holding, like, the Oculus handle things?

69
00:04:17,851 --> 00:04:21,329
Speaker 0: In fact, the Valve Index sensors will work just fine with a Vive.

70
00:04:23,059 --> 00:04:23,228
Speaker 1: Okay.

71
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:26,070
Speaker 0: They're even just better than the Vive sensors for a Vive.

72
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:30,850
Speaker 1: So if you have a Vive and you don't want to spend all the money on an index, you could just upgrade your handles?

73
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:31,776
Speaker 0: You could.

74
00:04:31,816 --> 00:04:33,190
Speaker 0: No, the sensors, not the handles.

75
00:04:34,241 --> 00:04:34,550
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

76
00:04:34,650 --> 00:04:36,050
Speaker 0: The sensors use laser tracking.

77
00:04:36,170 --> 00:04:37,610
Speaker 0: It's a different kind of tracking from Oculus.

78
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,624
Speaker 0: It's just better in every way.

79
00:04:39,995 --> 00:04:40,810
Speaker 0: But yeah, it arrived.

80
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:50,750
Speaker 0: And all I'll say about it now is that I've been so busy, it's been sitting there since two days ago, and I haven't even opened the box yet other than briefly to peek at it.

81
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:52,569
Speaker 0: I haven't had time to, like, set this shit up at all.

82
00:04:54,290 --> 00:05:01,390
Speaker 0: But the hardware feels so good, and it solves so many, like, hardware UX problems of the cheaper headsets.

83
00:05:02,054 --> 00:05:03,270
Speaker 0: I'm pretty excited to use it.

84
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:07,690
Speaker 1: So now, I hope so, considering the price and the fact that it's newer, that it would be better.

85
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:14,049
Speaker 0: Part of the reason I got it was that I want to get rid of my Oculus hardware because of the whole looming Facebook crap.

86
00:05:15,851 --> 00:05:22,070
Speaker 0: So I got to do that soon because I can't even, like, reinstall some of my Oculus stuff without getting a Facebook account.

87
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,467
Speaker 0: So, kind of locked in.

88
00:05:25,371 --> 00:05:31,148
Speaker 1: Is it, uh, is the the Index, I imagine, is not yet at the point where it's just a pair of sunglasses type device?

89
00:05:31,350 --> 00:05:32,049
Speaker 0: No, but it, uh, feels...

90
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:33,510
Speaker 1: It's still a giant thing you put on your head?

91
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:34,829
Speaker 0: Post-COVID, you got to try it.

92
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:37,170
Speaker 0: Because I've used the Index before.

93
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,910
Speaker 0: Like, not the one I own, but I've used a real Index before.

94
00:05:40,752 --> 00:05:44,370
Speaker 0: It fits real nice and is real comfortable.

95
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:48,410
Speaker 0: Like, two or three times more comfortable than an Oculus Quest.

96
00:05:48,612 --> 00:05:49,349
Speaker 0: Or an Oculus Rift.

97
00:05:50,092 --> 00:05:50,287
Speaker 0: It's not...

98
00:05:51,612 --> 00:05:57,548
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, even if it weighs less than the old one, I still don't have a Henry Rollins neck here, so...

99
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:59,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not a problem.

100
00:05:59,311 --> 00:06:03,782
Speaker 0: But I will say, what you want, something that's basically just sunglasses, that is easily 15 to 20 years away.

101
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,524
Speaker 1: All right, well, I'll wait 15, 20 years.

102
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,488
Speaker 1: I'm not in a rush.

103
00:06:07,931 --> 00:06:09,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's some... You'll see.

104
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,190
Speaker 0: You should play Superhot VR and see how you feel.

105
00:06:13,091 --> 00:06:15,170
Speaker 1: Okay, even if Superhot VR is so great...

106
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,330
Speaker 0: It is not worth buying an Index 4 by itself.

107
00:06:19,854 --> 00:06:21,450
Speaker 1: It's how much money exactly, right?

108
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:26,292
Speaker 1: I mean, I won't even buy a PS5 to play Spider-Man for $650.

109
00:06:26,292 --> 00:06:29,350
Speaker 1: I'm not paying $1,000 in who knows what dollars to play Superhot VR.

110
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:34,430
Speaker 0: I am doing development and experimentation, so there's a reason why I have three VR headsets.

111
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:35,050
Speaker 0: This is not just...

112
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:37,650
Speaker 1: I think that VR is just in that realm, right?

113
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:42,888
Speaker 1: Where it's like, if you are using it a lot, or you're developing on it...

114
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:43,710
Speaker 0: Like 3D printing!

115
00:06:44,271 --> 00:06:44,949
Speaker 1: It's your number one thing.

116
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:47,470
Speaker 0: Are you using 3D printing to do projects?

117
00:06:47,851 --> 00:06:52,310
Speaker 0: Or are you a 3D printing hobbyist, where 3D printing is itself your hobby?

118
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:53,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, all by all means.

119
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:58,050
Speaker 1: There are occasions where I would want a 3D printer, right?

120
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:06,053
Speaker 1: For example, I kind of want to do some 3D printing to try to make... Because all of the choices for Raspberry Pi handhelds are not... Ah, yeah.

121
00:07:07,934 --> 00:07:12,430
Speaker 1: So I feel like, hey, the only thing I can't do... Because the electronic parts I have down.

122
00:07:13,214 --> 00:07:15,370
Speaker 1: I got everything I need for electronics set, right?

123
00:07:15,571 --> 00:07:19,970
Speaker 1: I could just buy a screen, buy a Raspberry Pi, buy some buttons, right?

124
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:23,630
Speaker 1: And make the ideal Raspberry Pi handheld all on my own.

125
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,129
Speaker 1: I just need a case for it, and I don't like any of the cases that are out there.

126
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:30,170
Speaker 1: So I would have to make one with a 3D printer.

127
00:07:30,631 --> 00:07:35,730
Speaker 1: But I'm not going to buy a 3D printer for one project I have, and then it's going to sit there unused, right?

128
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:36,868
Speaker 1: Occasionally, like what?

129
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:40,690
Speaker 1: Once every couple years, if I break a piece on a Gundam model, I'll print one out.

130
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:42,549
Speaker 1: It's like, that's not worth it.

131
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:49,107
Speaker 0: That's why you got to have either a friend who has a 3D printer, or you just go to Shapeways and just like pay someone for a fancy, fancy printer.

132
00:07:50,393 --> 00:07:55,729
Speaker 1: Exactly, so VR is that same situation where, you know, if there really is, you know, like you got the Half-Life Alyx.

133
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,509
Speaker 1: Don't want to play that?

134
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I do want to play that, right?

135
00:07:58,591 --> 00:07:59,830
Speaker 1: I played every other Half-Life game.

136
00:07:59,891 --> 00:08:01,290
Speaker 1: Of course I want to play the Half-Life game.

137
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:04,128
Speaker 1: I don't... Thousand plus dollars want to play it though, so...

138
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:07,789
Speaker 0: You know, you could borrow my Oculus Quest and just tether it to your PC.

139
00:08:08,054 --> 00:08:08,649
Speaker 0: It would just work.

140
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,070
Speaker 1: Wouldn't I need to hook it up to my Facebook account?

141
00:08:11,994 --> 00:08:18,250
Speaker 0: Uh, we have a Facebook account linked to it that has not been deleted yet by Facebook.

142
00:08:18,351 --> 00:08:19,468
Speaker 0: That would probably just work.

143
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:23,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is, you know, not worth the hassle, I think.

144
00:08:24,132 --> 00:08:24,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can...

145
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:26,048
Speaker 1: I can live my life without...

146
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:34,710
Speaker 0: In a life post-Covid, you can come over and use the fancy VR, because I can get three people going in this house right now with varying levels of quality.

147
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:38,950
Speaker 0: Except I can't get a 3080.

148
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:39,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, you'll get one eventually.

149
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:43,390
Speaker 1: When 4080s come out, just get a 3080.

150
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:44,469
Speaker 1: It's like, you know...

151
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:49,118
Speaker 0: The 2080 is just such a piece of crap compared to the 3080 that... It's 3080 or nothing.

152
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:56,130
Speaker 1: Right, but it's 4080... How is... How is 40... You know, 2080 versus 1080, I think, was... You know, I didn't look at the benchmarks.

153
00:08:56,230 --> 00:08:58,370
Speaker 0: It was a big leap in a lot of ways.

154
00:08:58,911 --> 00:09:02,774
Speaker 0: It was like the leap between the 980 and the 1080.

155
00:09:02,774 --> 00:09:04,253
Speaker 1: From 10 to 20?

156
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:04,337
Speaker 0: Yeah.

157
00:09:06,472 --> 00:09:08,191
Speaker 1: Because I know 30 was way better than 20.

158
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,651
Speaker 1: Didn't get the feeling that 20 was way better than 10.

159
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:11,729
Speaker 0: No, 10 to 20 was not a big leap.

160
00:09:11,729 --> 00:09:14,029
Speaker 0: 9 to 10 was a big leap.

161
00:09:14,730 --> 00:09:17,104
Speaker 1: Right, so I'm saying 10 to 20 was not so big, 20 to 30 was.

162
00:09:18,430 --> 00:09:21,670
Speaker 1: So is 30 to 40 going to be a small or big leap?

163
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:22,829
Speaker 0: I think it'll be a small leap.

164
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,770
Speaker 1: If it is small, they're doing a TikTok situation, then get your 30s when the 40s come out.

165
00:09:29,071 --> 00:09:29,548
Speaker 1: Or whatever, you know.

166
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:31,189
Speaker 1: I really want to know what they're going to do.

167
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,390
Speaker 0: The thing is, they don't drop in price.

168
00:09:32,590 --> 00:09:33,670
Speaker 0: Video cards don't drop in price.

169
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:37,110
Speaker 0: So my philosophy, scalpers and supply chain issues aside...

170
00:09:37,211 --> 00:09:39,689
Speaker 1: They do drop in price at some point.

171
00:09:40,235 --> 00:09:40,769
Speaker 0: Not really.

172
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,498
Speaker 0: Not materially.

173
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,990
Speaker 0: By the time the 1080 was cheap, 1080 is garbage.

174
00:09:47,092 --> 00:09:48,749
Speaker 1: At least for me, it's not going to be garbage.

175
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:56,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, but my philosophy more is if I'm going to get a video card like that anyway, get it as early as possible to get the maximum use out of it during that cycle.

176
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:58,790
Speaker 1: Think of it this way, right?

177
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:02,950
Speaker 1: It's like if you've got a 4K screen and you want to play a game that's 60 FPS, right?

178
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:03,301
Speaker 1: Nope.

179
00:10:03,735 --> 00:10:03,848
Speaker 1: Okay.

180
00:10:04,734 --> 00:10:06,670
Speaker 0: A 1080 can barely keep up with that.

181
00:10:07,351 --> 00:10:10,064
Speaker 1: Right, but I'm saying if you get a video card that can do 4K 60, right?

182
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:22,710
Speaker 1: Like say a 3080, and you've got a 4K 60 screen, then you don't need 40, 80, 50, 80, 60, 80, 70, 80 until you get a screen that's better than 4K 60.

183
00:10:22,710 --> 00:10:24,649
Speaker 0: Or you're doing something like, you know what I can't do right now?

184
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:28,564
Speaker 0: I can't drive the Index at full, because it runs at 144 and high resolution.

185
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:32,323
Speaker 0: I can't outrun it at full off, right?

186
00:10:33,472 --> 00:10:40,630
Speaker 0: But also, even with my regular old Oculus, I can't stream VR while playing it, even with a 1080.

187
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,330
Speaker 0: I run into serious performance issues.

188
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:56,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we feel like we've reached sort of like, not the end, but sort of a slowing down in terms of games demanding more from the GPU at the same frame rate and at the same resolution, right?

189
00:10:56,290 --> 00:11:02,789
Speaker 1: In terms of like, oh, we've got new features like shadowing this and, you know, shading that and all this stuff.

190
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:10,789
Speaker 0: Overwatch runs fine in 4K 60, but Star Wars Squadrons, I had to dump it down to 1080 to get it to have a good frame rate.

191
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:11,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, sure.

192
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:21,390
Speaker 1: But they've also got, you know, there's also, I think the time that that will change is when more things start using that real-time ray tracing stuff that they've added.

193
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,969
Speaker 0: Or games get designed around the AI rendering stuff.

194
00:11:25,890 --> 00:11:26,013
Speaker 1: Yep.

195
00:11:26,506 --> 00:11:26,670
Speaker 1: Anyway.

196
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:27,150
Speaker 0: Yep.

197
00:11:27,392 --> 00:11:32,810
Speaker 0: So anyway, in some animation anime news, real quick, Geek Byte, as you know, we reviewed Deca Dance recently.

198
00:11:33,011 --> 00:11:33,626
Speaker 0: Scott had finished it.

199
00:11:34,053 --> 00:11:34,989
Speaker 0: I now also finished it.

200
00:11:35,393 --> 00:11:35,778
Speaker 0: It's great.

201
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:36,469
Speaker 0: Just go watch it.

202
00:11:36,913 --> 00:11:38,690
Speaker 0: It gave me exactly what I expected.

203
00:11:39,151 --> 00:11:39,875
Speaker 0: The same feels.

204
00:11:39,955 --> 00:11:42,650
Speaker 0: I got watching a show like Full Metal Alchemist back in the day.

205
00:11:43,014 --> 00:11:43,588
Speaker 0: Solid show.

206
00:11:44,011 --> 00:11:44,927
Speaker 0: Good stuff going on.

207
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:49,609
Speaker 0: Satisfying ending, which actually is something that's better than Full Metal Alchemist was.

208
00:11:50,898 --> 00:11:51,288
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

209
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:52,809
Speaker 1: Sick burn.

210
00:11:53,451 --> 00:11:54,770
Speaker 0: But it gave me like that level of feeling.

211
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,568
Speaker 0: Like it was an anime where every episode, like right up to the end, I thought, wow, I want to watch the next episode right now.

212
00:12:01,130 --> 00:12:06,850
Speaker 0: But then as Scott warned me, I also thought, wow, that was the end of a normal anime and there are several episodes to go.

213
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:10,554
Speaker 1: Yep.

214
00:12:10,756 --> 00:12:11,948
Speaker 1: That's exactly how that is.

215
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:15,849
Speaker 0: You warned me and we hit the moment and I was like, okay, that was it.

216
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:17,050
Speaker 0: That was what Scott was talking about.

217
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:17,730
Speaker 0: What the fuck?

218
00:12:20,071 --> 00:12:20,312
Speaker 1: Yeah.

219
00:12:20,353 --> 00:12:23,050
Speaker 1: Episode nine feels like that would normally be the end of the show.

220
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,710
Speaker 1: What are they going to do next to fund the next three episodes?

221
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:25,975
Speaker 0: Sure enough.

222
00:12:26,992 --> 00:12:27,168
Speaker 0: They did.

223
00:12:27,412 --> 00:12:27,886
Speaker 0: They did stuff.

224
00:12:28,451 --> 00:12:28,809
Speaker 0: Decadence.

225
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:29,386
Speaker 0: Watch it.

226
00:12:30,217 --> 00:12:30,749
Speaker 0: It's a good show.

227
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:31,623
Speaker 0: We talked about it.

228
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:33,350
Speaker 0: So you got any news?

229
00:12:34,516 --> 00:12:35,990
Speaker 1: I got also a tiny Geek Bite.

230
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:40,050
Speaker 1: So I ordered the Wolfwalkers art book.

231
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:41,529
Speaker 1: It's a coffee table book.

232
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,590
Speaker 1: So, you know, unless you got a place to put it, don't buy it.

233
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:47,509
Speaker 0: I look forward to visiting you post COVID so I can flip through this book.

234
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:48,581
Speaker 1: Yeah.

235
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:55,170
Speaker 1: This book is showing you, like, I don't know if there's anything in this book that's left out.

236
00:12:55,290 --> 00:13:01,229
Speaker 1: It feels like every single piece of, I guess, interesting to look at in any way.

237
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,090
Speaker 1: Production artwork, right?

238
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,390
Speaker 1: Is in this book somewhere.

239
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,090
Speaker 1: Like, it's just like, is the whole storyboard in there?

240
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:08,849
Speaker 1: I don't even freaking know.

241
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,589
Speaker 1: It's like, there's just everything in there.

242
00:13:10,952 --> 00:13:11,989
Speaker 1: I don't know what they left out.

243
00:13:12,531 --> 00:13:15,189
Speaker 1: There's so much text explaining everything too.

244
00:13:15,673 --> 00:13:16,669
Speaker 0: It's like, that's the key.

245
00:13:16,870 --> 00:13:18,430
Speaker 0: That's what I really like an art book.

246
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:19,710
Speaker 1: It's not just an art book.

247
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:24,530
Speaker 1: This is like, this is basically like the complete behind the scenes commentary.

248
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:29,370
Speaker 1: Like everything there is to know about this movie and how it was made is in this one book.

249
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:44,490
Speaker 1: The most interesting thing, and this is probably boring because to animators or people who knew know about this, but this is a, an animation techniques that I knew all the parts of it existed, but I was not aware of this specific combination.

250
00:13:45,411 --> 00:13:51,408
Speaker 1: So, you know, the scene in Wolfwalkers or the scenes where they're following the wolf scent and it's sort of like the yellow.

251
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:51,833
Speaker 1: Yeah.

252
00:13:52,312 --> 00:13:53,009
Speaker 0: Those were good scenes.

253
00:13:53,591 --> 00:13:54,709
Speaker 0: Very samurai Jack.

254
00:13:55,730 --> 00:13:55,870
Speaker 1: Right.

255
00:13:56,230 --> 00:14:00,990
Speaker 1: So specifically the one inside, uh, the scullery, right.

256
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,710
Speaker 1: Where it's like, you know, going up the stairs, right.

257
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:05,290
Speaker 1: Past the hallway, all that stuff.

258
00:14:05,353 --> 00:14:05,548
Speaker 1: Right.

259
00:14:06,230 --> 00:14:14,530
Speaker 1: So the way that was animated is they made the scullery right in 3d in CG on a computer.

260
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:20,070
Speaker 1: And then they moved the camera around file, you know, first person view camera, right.

261
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:24,570
Speaker 1: They moved it around the scullery and they had sort of like a yellow wavy line, right.

262
00:14:24,690 --> 00:14:26,689
Speaker 1: That was on the, on the screen there, right.

263
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,970
Speaker 1: Representing where the wolf scent was sense were right.

264
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:30,730
Speaker 1: That they were smelling.

265
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:31,284
Speaker 1: Mm hmm.

266
00:14:31,611 --> 00:14:35,570
Speaker 1: Uh, and then I guess I assume this is the, I don't know.

267
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:38,550
Speaker 1: The movie was, must've been done on twos or threes or whatever.

268
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:39,128
Speaker 1: Right.

269
00:14:39,751 --> 00:14:44,050
Speaker 1: But they print it out on paper, like dead trees.

270
00:14:44,521 --> 00:14:44,750
Speaker 1: Right.

271
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:49,269
Speaker 1: The, the outlines of the, you know, the, the, the CG.

272
00:14:49,410 --> 00:14:49,555
Speaker 1: Right.

273
00:14:50,510 --> 00:14:58,410
Speaker 1: So it's, it's basically just like one color line, thin lines showing you, like, you know, like, you know, the walls, the, the floors, right.

274
00:14:58,511 --> 00:14:59,049
Speaker 1: All that stuff.

275
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:08,130
Speaker 1: Just like the, the, like, if you were in like a counter-strike map and you said only draw, you know, the outlines of all the objects basically, right.

276
00:15:08,314 --> 00:15:08,949
Speaker 1: Of what you're seeing.

277
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:15,070
Speaker 1: And then they took all those papers and they drew on the papers with pencil.

278
00:15:16,493 --> 00:15:18,849
Speaker 1: And then that is what's in the movie is the pencil.

279
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,789
Speaker 1: Real actual pencil.

280
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:23,710
Speaker 0: Ah, it's like, it's like a modern take on rotoscoping.

281
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:24,350
Speaker 1: Right.

282
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:28,908
Speaker 1: It's like, it's not, it's not necessarily rotoscoping exactly, but it's like CG.

283
00:15:29,671 --> 00:15:34,530
Speaker 1: And then just to, and then you trace what you printed out of a printer with a pencil.

284
00:15:34,691 --> 00:15:37,510
Speaker 1: And that's how they made those, that, those, those cuts there.

285
00:15:37,651 --> 00:15:41,030
Speaker 1: And I thought I was like, whoa, that's sort of genius and awesome.

286
00:15:41,930 --> 00:15:43,449
Speaker 1: Uh, I liked that anyway.

287
00:15:44,572 --> 00:15:45,790
Speaker 1: Uh, so it was fascinating.

288
00:15:45,891 --> 00:15:47,408
Speaker 1: So if you love shit like that, get that book.

289
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:48,570
Speaker 0: We'll get that book.

290
00:15:49,058 --> 00:15:49,444
Speaker 0: It's like 30 bucks.

291
00:15:50,930 --> 00:15:51,030
Speaker 1: Yeah.

292
00:15:51,251 --> 00:15:52,990
Speaker 1: It's a big hardcover coffee till book.

293
00:15:53,190 --> 00:15:54,529
Speaker 1: It's next to my mouse guard art book.

294
00:15:56,743 --> 00:15:57,110
Speaker 1: Uh, okay.

295
00:15:57,212 --> 00:15:58,030
Speaker 1: What else we got in the news?

296
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:04,810
Speaker 1: Tiny news, uh, Funimation streaming service, which, you know, competes with the C-roll and the Netflix and whatever.

297
00:16:05,611 --> 00:16:14,690
Speaker 1: Uh, they just got basically all the Gundams, not all the Gundams literally, but original Gundam, unicorn Gundam, Gundam seed, Gundam seed destiny.

298
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:15,364
Speaker 1: Don't watch that.

299
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:20,950
Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, if you want to watch some Gundams legally, uh, Funimation is the place.

300
00:16:21,051 --> 00:16:24,610
Speaker 1: Cause it was not necessarily easy to watch all of those legally.

301
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:31,210
Speaker 0: You know, I'm really excited because I've actually been hankering to watch Gundam seed again.

302
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:34,770
Speaker 0: It's actually my favorite non OAV Gundam.

303
00:16:36,612 --> 00:16:40,430
Speaker 1: Uh, non OAV Gundam, I don't know.

304
00:16:40,756 --> 00:16:41,009
Speaker 1: Maybe.

305
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:46,569
Speaker 1: I mean, all the, all the like original Gundam, Gundam seed, Zeta, Gundam are all kind of, kind of equal as TV shows.

306
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:51,730
Speaker 1: I guess those are the only TV, full TV series Gundams I've watched all of.

307
00:16:51,830 --> 00:16:53,470
Speaker 1: I know to stay away from double Zeta Gundam.

308
00:16:56,392 --> 00:16:58,965
Speaker 0: I got a couple episodes into unicorn before.

309
00:16:59,006 --> 00:16:59,830
Speaker 0: I just didn't care.

310
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:01,043
Speaker 1: Yeah.

311
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:02,389
Speaker 1: Unicorn's a little less than those.

312
00:17:02,671 --> 00:17:04,910
Speaker 1: Um, it's not, it's not double Zeta territory.

313
00:17:06,252 --> 00:17:13,270
Speaker 1: Uh, there is in slightly related news, uh, Right Stuff was putting out new HD Gundam seed, right?

314
00:17:13,415 --> 00:17:13,730
Speaker 1: Boores.

315
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:21,409
Speaker 1: And what happened was is, you know how in Japan they'll put an anime on TV and then when they put it on DVD, they'll sort of fix it.

316
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,310
Speaker 1: They just doing, they'll do it quickly to get it on TV quickly.

317
00:17:24,832 --> 00:17:27,930
Speaker 1: And then animation mistakes will get fixed before they put out DVD.

318
00:17:28,349 --> 00:17:29,010
Speaker 0: Remember Sailor Moon?

319
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,190
Speaker 1: Right.

320
00:17:30,271 --> 00:17:30,710
Speaker 1: Exactly.

321
00:17:32,451 --> 00:17:39,412
Speaker 1: So apparently the Gundam seed HD remaster Boores that Right Stuff had, or I guess not HD.

322
00:17:40,270 --> 00:17:41,808
Speaker 1: They were HD, but they were from TV.

323
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:45,189
Speaker 1: They were not the fixed, uh, you know, DVD release ones.

324
00:17:45,911 --> 00:17:47,289
Speaker 1: So apparently they're correcting that.

325
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:58,227
Speaker 1: So I guess if you have shitty Gundam seed HD discs from Right Stuff, you can get newer better ones that are, have all the animation stuff fixed from, you know, for, I guess at no cost, I assume.

326
00:17:59,131 --> 00:18:02,729
Speaker 1: And going forward, I assume they're only going to send out, you know, good ones.

327
00:18:03,371 --> 00:18:05,990
Speaker 1: Um, they got the, they got the wrong materials and then they got the right material.

328
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:15,050
Speaker 0: I mean, it feels like Gundam shows have had more problems with the, the putting something broken on the DVD than a lot of other properties for some reason.

329
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:17,030
Speaker 1: No, I think it happens actually somewhat frequently.

330
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:21,330
Speaker 0: But it might just be that Gundam fans notice and complain more and it makes more press.

331
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:21,790
Speaker 0: I think that's true.

332
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,710
Speaker 1: I think also it's only extreme anime nerds even pay attention to things like that or know about things like that.

333
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,510
Speaker 0: Like how would a normal fan of a show even notice?

334
00:18:29,511 --> 00:18:30,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

335
00:18:31,531 --> 00:18:34,590
Speaker 1: Uh, so yeah, and then that relates to the, the original news, right?

336
00:18:34,670 --> 00:18:39,549
Speaker 1: Cause the Right Stuff materials are sort of what's being used for some of the Funimation streams.

337
00:18:39,691 --> 00:18:44,390
Speaker 1: So a lot of the Funimation streams you're going to watch are just what is on the Right Stuff.

338
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:46,087
Speaker 1: So there you go.

339
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,790
Speaker 0: So you might've seen the news a while ago.

340
00:18:47,911 --> 00:18:49,370
Speaker 0: I'm a huge fan of the Venture Brothers.

341
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:53,570
Speaker 0: I think it is very important and very good animated television.

342
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:54,810
Speaker 0: Like that show is fantastic.

343
00:18:55,692 --> 00:18:57,250
Speaker 0: Uh, it's evolved a lot over the years.

344
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:58,470
Speaker 0: Like I could go on about it forever.

345
00:18:58,551 --> 00:18:59,709
Speaker 0: I'm not going to bother you with that.

346
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:06,843
Speaker 0: Now the news was that it was canceled, which on one hand you might think, oh, that's a shame that shows been running for 17 years.

347
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:15,510
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, you might think, wait, Venture Brothers was still running because it tends to take them a long time to make a season.

348
00:19:16,252 --> 00:19:20,130
Speaker 0: Like it's been running 17 years, but they've only done like what?

349
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,842
Speaker 1: Seven seasons in a movie and the season in 17 years.

350
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:27,088
Speaker 1: It's that old.

351
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,047
Speaker 0: It's that old.

352
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:35,870
Speaker 0: We were, it was already running for a while when we were at that one packs where all the universes were playing episodes from it, like in the theater.

353
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:38,110
Speaker 1: 17 years is 2003.

354
00:19:38,110 --> 00:19:39,790
Speaker 1: We were still in college when it was a new show.

355
00:19:40,671 --> 00:19:44,210
Speaker 1: I don't remember it existing until like, you know, much later than that.

356
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:47,689
Speaker 0: I didn't get into it until several seasons were already in.

357
00:19:48,671 --> 00:19:50,789
Speaker 1: And they've only had seven seasons in all that time.

358
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:57,250
Speaker 0: But, uh, the first season hit or miss, like, it's not great to be honest, but it's like it like Adventure Time and other shows that evolved and evolved.

359
00:19:57,330 --> 00:19:58,869
Speaker 0: And, uh, it's made me cry.

360
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:01,189
Speaker 0: Like it's a really fantastic show.

361
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:09,910
Speaker 0: But getting canceled was kind of a big deal because the show, part of the reason why it takes so long to make it is that they are sort of perfectionist about it.

362
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:11,350
Speaker 0: And they make sure that it's right.

363
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,329
Speaker 0: Like it's always tight.

364
00:20:12,791 --> 00:20:23,049
Speaker 0: It's very well put together and they won't put out a season until they're done with it, which is, I thought it might be that they're just not, uh, you know, working ridiculous hours, right?

365
00:20:23,854 --> 00:20:25,210
Speaker 0: Everything I read, they're working.

366
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:30,410
Speaker 1: We're not doing the South Park thing where they show up late at night and work nonstop to get the episode out.

367
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:36,988
Speaker 0: It's more like they get the episode done and then they polish it for like 10 times the time they spent making it.

368
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:38,970
Speaker 1: And they're only working eight hours a day.

369
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:41,370
Speaker 0: Every day, polish, polish, polish, polish, polish.

370
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,109
Speaker 1: And where are they getting the money for all this?

371
00:20:43,712 --> 00:20:44,630
Speaker 1: Uh, that's the problem.

372
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,347
Speaker 0: You can't make money with a show like that.

373
00:20:47,013 --> 00:20:48,289
Speaker 0: So adult swim canceled it.

374
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:54,448
Speaker 0: I can't imagine that adult swim has been making money on this show at any point in like the last five years.

375
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:58,789
Speaker 0: But the show is a very large, very dedicated following and it's good TV.

376
00:20:59,831 --> 00:21:06,208
Speaker 0: There are serious, credible rumors that HBO, HBO max in particular is rumors, right?

377
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,589
Speaker 1: It's not an official announcement here.

378
00:21:08,670 --> 00:21:17,170
Speaker 0: While it is not official, there have been statements, uh, talking about this exploration from HBO since like it's, it's credible and serious.

379
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:20,349
Speaker 0: Like HBO max is talking to them about what it would take.

380
00:21:20,830 --> 00:21:23,010
Speaker 1: So if this rumor turns out to be false, the show is canceled.

381
00:21:23,230 --> 00:21:23,408
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

382
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:27,349
Speaker 1: The show is canceled unless it's the canceling a new, is the canceling a new news.

383
00:21:27,934 --> 00:21:29,649
Speaker 0: That news was from not that long ago.

384
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,530
Speaker 0: I just haven't talked like from September.

385
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:34,610
Speaker 1: So did the show and it's, I guess you said the seven.

386
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:37,450
Speaker 0: There is another season that is still in flight.

387
00:21:37,572 --> 00:21:38,529
Speaker 0: That is to come out.

388
00:21:38,711 --> 00:21:45,009
Speaker 0: If it gets canceled the next season, which will not resolve anything because it was not intended to be the last season will be.

389
00:21:45,490 --> 00:21:47,110
Speaker 1: That's what I was, that's what I was asking about.

390
00:21:47,330 --> 00:21:47,744
Speaker 0: It's like, yup.

391
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:56,210
Speaker 0: So one more season would come out, which would be a shame because the last season ended on a really interesting note and also kind of a cliffhanger.

392
00:21:56,351 --> 00:22:00,909
Speaker 0: And the next season was setting up some really fun stuff that would probably take another 17 years to resolve.

393
00:22:02,852 --> 00:22:06,450
Speaker 0: But, uh, HBO max picking it up actually makes sense.

394
00:22:06,670 --> 00:22:09,330
Speaker 0: I mean, look at HBO max picked up adventure time.

395
00:22:10,219 --> 00:22:10,407
Speaker 1: Yep.

396
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:11,010
Speaker 1: Yeah.

397
00:22:11,010 --> 00:22:15,348
Speaker 1: I mean, the pattern that I'm seeing these days is that Disney owns most of the world, right?

398
00:22:15,952 --> 00:22:24,470
Speaker 1: And then Netflix, they own some stuff and they're making some deals, but Netflix seems to really want to make its own IPs, right?

399
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:31,109
Speaker 1: Mostly, um, you know, and then, you know, have those things succeed because then they get to keep all the monies.

400
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:33,389
Speaker 1: They don't have to make licensing deals or pay anyone else.

401
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:33,750
Speaker 1: Right.

402
00:22:33,831 --> 00:22:36,189
Speaker 1: So it's like, just make as much original stuff as you can.

403
00:22:36,672 --> 00:22:37,970
Speaker 1: Maybe some of it will be so great.

404
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:39,147
Speaker 1: No one can take it from you.

405
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:39,641
Speaker 1: Right.

406
00:22:39,910 --> 00:22:41,130
Speaker 1: You're just the master of everything.

407
00:22:41,171 --> 00:22:42,450
Speaker 1: And that's the Netflix realm.

408
00:22:43,751 --> 00:22:47,090
Speaker 1: Still keeping some deals that you have enough stuff that people would want to be your customer.

409
00:22:47,195 --> 00:22:47,450
Speaker 1: Right.

410
00:22:48,150 --> 00:22:53,250
Speaker 1: Um, Apple sort of over there being like this dark horse hiding in the back.

411
00:22:53,762 --> 00:22:53,930
Speaker 1: Right.

412
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:57,670
Speaker 1: And I think much like with everything else, no one's going to care about that stuff.

413
00:22:59,113 --> 00:23:04,203
Speaker 1: Um, you know, except for the few exclusive things that Apple gets, like a Wolfwalker situation.

414
00:23:04,779 --> 00:23:04,990
Speaker 1: Right.

415
00:23:05,230 --> 00:23:08,629
Speaker 1: I mean, does anyone care about literally anything else on Apple TV plus at all?

416
00:23:10,452 --> 00:23:14,070
Speaker 1: And then HBO max is sitting over there and HBO has their original stuff.

417
00:23:14,219 --> 00:23:14,370
Speaker 1: Right.

418
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,609
Speaker 1: And they're going to keep making the original stuff that they make.

419
00:23:17,472 --> 00:23:19,750
Speaker 1: Um, you know, I guess what HBO is like Game of Thrones stuff.

420
00:23:19,982 --> 00:23:20,130
Speaker 1: Right.

421
00:23:20,211 --> 00:23:21,509
Speaker 1: You know, they own that all the way.

422
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:28,729
Speaker 0: But again, HBO max is making like the new adventure times that we're about to talk about.

423
00:23:29,810 --> 00:23:31,865
Speaker 1: Is they are also right.

424
00:23:32,950 --> 00:23:36,470
Speaker 1: They are going out and basically getting anything that Disney doesn't own.

425
00:23:36,953 --> 00:23:38,489
Speaker 1: Anything that's not nailed to the ground.

426
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:40,810
Speaker 1: HBO max is like yoink, yoink, yoink.

427
00:23:41,010 --> 00:23:42,102
Speaker 0: Oh, actually no, that's subtly.

428
00:23:42,142 --> 00:23:42,830
Speaker 0: they're funding it.

429
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:45,890
Speaker 0: But the production is still Cartoon Network and Frederator.

430
00:23:46,890 --> 00:23:46,986
Speaker 1: Yeah.

431
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:54,250
Speaker 1: But you know, anyway, you know, I'm just talking about getting stuff onto their via whatever means right to, to flesh out.

432
00:23:54,330 --> 00:24:00,364
Speaker 1: Cause if HBO max is literally nothing but the HBO original, you know, serial shows that they do.

433
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:02,030
Speaker 0: That's a recipe for disaster.

434
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:03,330
Speaker 0: That's how Showtime struggled.

435
00:24:04,215 --> 00:24:04,550
Speaker 1: Exactly.

436
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:07,589
Speaker 1: Those are very huge popular shows.

437
00:24:07,790 --> 00:24:11,249
Speaker 1: You know, your games of thrones, you know, I guess Sopranos is like the one that sort of started all that.

438
00:24:11,376 --> 00:24:11,589
Speaker 1: Right.

439
00:24:11,771 --> 00:24:13,910
Speaker 1: And then going forward to Game of Thrones.

440
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:16,288
Speaker 1: But there are enough of those.

441
00:24:17,051 --> 00:24:24,770
Speaker 1: So people will subscribe to HBO max, watch all of them if they're, even if they're the biggest fans of those things, and then they'll be done with HBO max.

442
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,410
Speaker 0: I've been guilty of that kind of pattern before.

443
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:28,570
Speaker 1: Right.

444
00:24:28,650 --> 00:24:34,783
Speaker 1: And even if HBO does come out with more shows like that, which they will, they don't do it in such a large like quantity.

445
00:24:34,843 --> 00:24:36,190
Speaker 1: the way that Netflix is right.

446
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,670
Speaker 1: You know, Netflix is like new show, new show, new thing, new thing.

447
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:39,950
Speaker 1: Right.

448
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:46,590
Speaker 1: And, and you know, some of their new things, they try to make a big deal, but it's like they still got, you know, how many seasons of dragon prince going on?

449
00:24:46,671 --> 00:24:48,070
Speaker 1: And it's like, it's like so quiet.

450
00:24:48,170 --> 00:24:50,268
Speaker 1: They're so quiet with the dragon prince, but there it is.

451
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:56,008
Speaker 0: Even though that show is standout quality show, not enough people are talking about dragon prince.

452
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,230
Speaker 0: Uh, but what's that?

453
00:24:59,391 --> 00:25:00,450
Speaker 0: So extra interesting.

454
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:00,622
Speaker 0: Yeah.

455
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:07,266
Speaker 0: Andy Forsell, who's basically the HBO max guy actually issued a statement saying we're working on it for real.

456
00:25:08,530 --> 00:25:08,906
Speaker 1: Okay.

457
00:25:09,551 --> 00:25:12,182
Speaker 0: Uh, so I clicked on his Twitter cause I don't know a lot about him as a person

458
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:13,910
Speaker 1: and I think

459
00:25:14,271 --> 00:25:26,127
Speaker 0: I am more fondly disposed toward HBO max now than I was before because the last thing he tweeted was bitching about how everyone wants giant phones anymore and he can't get a small phone.

460
00:25:28,452 --> 00:25:32,730
Speaker 0: And the thing he tweeted before that was I'm going to try to save adventure brothers.

461
00:25:34,350 --> 00:25:34,446
Speaker 1: Yeah.

462
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:37,130
Speaker 1: I mean, I have been feeling, you know, even before today, right.

463
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:46,982
Speaker 1: That like, yeah, Netflix, I've watched a lot of stuff on Netflix recently, but I'm sort of running a little low on stuff to watch on Netflix and maybe it's time to cancel the Netflix sign up for HBO max for awhile and then switch back.

464
00:25:49,011 --> 00:25:52,708
Speaker 0: You know, of course Hilda is going to be on Netflix imminently season two.

465
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:56,650
Speaker 0: That's one of the best animated shows I've seen in history.

466
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:58,309
Speaker 0: You haven't, you didn't watch Hilda.

467
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,886
Speaker 1: Why would I have, I don't watch things.

468
00:26:01,811 --> 00:26:02,730
Speaker 0: Do I watch Hilda?

469
00:26:02,930 --> 00:26:05,269
Speaker 0: It is one of the best things on Netflix.

470
00:26:06,835 --> 00:26:07,589
Speaker 0: I'm not kidding.

471
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:08,849
Speaker 0: It is fantastic.

472
00:26:11,453 --> 00:26:13,769
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, venture brothers might get saved.

473
00:26:14,592 --> 00:26:23,789
Speaker 0: In some other news that's only tangentially related to Wednesday because comics can be covered by this depending, uh, there's a complicated structure around these publishing companies.

474
00:26:23,951 --> 00:26:32,389
Speaker 0: Like you might even know that, like know the parent company if you live in Europe, but in the U S you probably know them as their penguin or penguin random house.

475
00:26:33,705 --> 00:26:33,788
Speaker 1: Yeah.

476
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:43,490
Speaker 1: There's basically, uh, over time in the U S you know, book publishing companies have, you know, joined merged, right.

477
00:26:43,915 --> 00:26:45,070
Speaker 1: Bought, died.

478
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:55,729
Speaker 1: And there was, I think I remember at one time hearing, I don't know, I can't remember it cause I, it's been so long since I had, I had a friend who isn't publishing and I haven't talked to them and who knows how long.

479
00:26:56,934 --> 00:26:59,289
Speaker 1: Um, but, uh, probably, I don't think they're even remember I exist.

480
00:26:59,994 --> 00:27:00,549
Speaker 1: It's so long.

481
00:27:00,771 --> 00:27:04,970
Speaker 1: So, but I remember people were talking, I think at one time I could be misremembering.

482
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:07,569
Speaker 1: There was like a big five and now there's like a big three.

483
00:27:08,272 --> 00:27:10,390
Speaker 1: Are we down to a big two or big one?

484
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:13,830
Speaker 0: Already we're talking about penguin random house.

485
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,988
Speaker 0: I remember when penguin was its own thing.

486
00:27:17,222 --> 00:27:17,489
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

487
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:30,405
Speaker 0: And basically the news is via com CBS, which is already, uh, has agreed to sell Simon and Schuster to penguin random house for actually small amount.

488
00:27:32,032 --> 00:27:32,650
Speaker 0: It's only 2 billion.

489
00:27:33,582 --> 00:27:33,810
Speaker 1: Okay.

490
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:34,469
Speaker 1: So here it is.

491
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:35,129
Speaker 1: I figured it out.

492
00:27:35,211 --> 00:27:36,549
Speaker 1: So yeah, it was big five.

493
00:27:37,411 --> 00:27:38,540
Speaker 1: So as of 2019, right?

494
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:47,910
Speaker 1: The big five were penguin random house, the biggest, like $3 billion, like over 3 billion, Hashet, right?

495
00:27:48,171 --> 00:27:49,109
Speaker 1: Almost $3 billion.

496
00:27:49,891 --> 00:27:51,690
Speaker 1: Harper Collins, one and a half billion.

497
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,150
Speaker 1: So Harper Collins is already half less than half of penguin random house.

498
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:58,150
Speaker 1: McMillan is about the same as Harper Collins.

499
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:02,025
Speaker 1: Simon and Schuster was number five at less than a billion, 830 million.

500
00:28:03,452 --> 00:28:05,529
Speaker 1: So this turns the big five into the big four.

501
00:28:06,011 --> 00:28:14,190
Speaker 1: It puts penguin random house at over 4 billion, which is more than a billion ahead of second place, which is still Hashet.

502
00:28:14,952 --> 00:28:16,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, we need some antitrust.

503
00:28:17,351 --> 00:28:23,290
Speaker 1: So this turns the big five into the big one and the second tier three, right?

504
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:24,307
Speaker 0: You know what?

505
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:26,698
Speaker 0: Whatever commentary we were going to have.

506
00:28:26,718 --> 00:28:30,550
Speaker 0: the second tweet in this thread actually says everything we need to say.

507
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:31,409
Speaker 0: I'm just going to quote it.

508
00:28:31,490 --> 00:28:32,189
Speaker 0: New York times book.

509
00:28:32,552 --> 00:28:33,629
Speaker 1: The FTC should stop this.

510
00:28:34,751 --> 00:28:40,853
Speaker 0: Quote, the sale of the company will profoundly reshape the publishing industry, increasingly a winner.

511
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:46,306
Speaker 0: take all business in which the largest companies compete for brand name authors and guaranteed bestsellers.

512
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:47,406
Speaker 1: Yes.

513
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:53,169
Speaker 0: The sale will lead to the loss of editorial and marketing positions, imprints, fewer outlets for new books.

514
00:28:53,451 --> 00:28:56,249
Speaker 0: This is kind of a catastrophe for the book publishing business.

515
00:28:57,150 --> 00:29:02,530
Speaker 1: Well, the real problem, and I forget who tweeted this, but it basically says everything, right?

516
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:07,870
Speaker 1: Is like we are going to allow, you know, what is published, right?

517
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:23,390
Speaker 1: If, you know, professionally published for money in the United States in English to be decided by a very small number of people, it's worse than that who are so not democratically elected people.

518
00:29:23,430 --> 00:29:28,789
Speaker 1: It is so much worse than that because that was already true, but it's even more true.

519
00:29:29,291 --> 00:29:36,669
Speaker 0: So Penguin Random House was actually big in the news today for some bad shit that's going down there.

520
00:29:36,790 --> 00:29:38,504
Speaker 0: The people who are now going to own all of this.

521
00:29:39,930 --> 00:29:47,650
Speaker 0: They are publishing Jordan Peterson, that piece of shit's book, and their staff are like freaking out, threatening to quit.

522
00:29:47,790 --> 00:29:55,049
Speaker 0: All the good people who work for Penguin Random House are talking about quitting because they're letting this Nazi guy publish his book.

523
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:57,448
Speaker 1: Yeah, that sounds good.

524
00:29:57,650 --> 00:29:58,087
Speaker 1: I'd quit too.

525
00:29:58,513 --> 00:30:00,730
Speaker 0: I would quit if my company did something with Jordan Peterson.

526
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:09,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know my company, you know, where is a music company, and I'm pretty sure that we don't sign anyone doing Nazi music, right?

527
00:30:09,430 --> 00:30:16,090
Speaker 1: I think there was like a discussion about that or something because I was like, yeah, if I was like, I would look, you know, people were tweeting, talking about it.

528
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,690
Speaker 1: And I was like, yeah, if I found out that we did, I would raise a stink.

529
00:30:18,790 --> 00:30:22,130
Speaker 1: And if they didn't, you know, stop it, I'd leave and I didn't have to leave.

530
00:30:23,011 --> 00:30:29,990
Speaker 0: It's a bad situation and that is the company that is now going to own Simon & Schuster.

531
00:30:32,771 --> 00:30:40,230
Speaker 0: So, before we get into things of the day, someone pointed out in the stream that to try to get you to watch Hilda, you know what Hilda's got?

532
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,210
Speaker 0: That rare quantity.

533
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:42,972
Speaker 0: Remember how?

534
00:30:42,992 --> 00:30:45,410
Speaker 0: in Madoka, who is the best character in Madoka Magica?

535
00:30:47,051 --> 00:30:50,169
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

536
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,639
Speaker 0: There was a younger.

537
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:53,190
Speaker 0: Scott would have said something very specific.

538
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,289
Speaker 0: He would have said Madoka's mom.

539
00:30:55,801 --> 00:30:56,089
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

540
00:30:56,310 --> 00:30:57,066
Speaker 1: Yeah, there you go.

541
00:30:57,751 --> 00:31:03,529
Speaker 0: So, basically, in Hilda, Hilda's mom is a Madoka mom situation, like to a T.

542
00:31:04,938 --> 00:31:05,150
Speaker 1: Okay.

543
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:07,188
Speaker 0: But anyway.

544
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:10,630
Speaker 1: So, barely in the show and I don't remember them when I have to think.

545
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,730
Speaker 0: But then has pivotal moments where you'll go, oh, that's a good mom.

546
00:31:14,851 --> 00:31:16,089
Speaker 0: That's an anime mom right there.

547
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:16,422
Speaker 0: Yes.

548
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,009
Speaker 0: Things of the day.

549
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:27,710
Speaker 0: So, I actually have an anime animation related thing.

550
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:31,029
Speaker 0: This is a short animated film that is beautiful and creepy.

551
00:31:31,610 --> 00:31:34,310
Speaker 0: Animated by Shingo Tamagawa, who does a lot of work in anime.

552
00:31:35,152 --> 00:31:38,490
Speaker 0: It's just a short animated creepy film that is free to watch on YouTube.

553
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,449
Speaker 0: And I think you should watch it.

554
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:46,930
Speaker 0: The style reminds me a little bit of things like Oniyama's in terms of how the characters are drawn.

555
00:31:47,432 --> 00:31:49,069
Speaker 0: It's very simple, very creepy, very short.

556
00:31:49,476 --> 00:31:50,270
Speaker 0: But it's worth watching.

557
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:51,625
Speaker 1: Okay.

558
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:53,650
Speaker 1: Here's the thing of the day.

559
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,029
Speaker 1: It's a very rim thing of the day.

560
00:31:55,951 --> 00:32:07,730
Speaker 1: So, the US Coast Guard, its largest ship that it has in its fleet, right, has several big electric engines in it that are many, many, many, many horsepower.

561
00:32:08,372 --> 00:32:10,770
Speaker 1: They are, as you would imagine, a boat engine.

562
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:13,030
Speaker 0: Slapped aside, you can fit so many horses in this thing.

563
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:13,945
Speaker 1: That's right.

564
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:15,090
Speaker 1: Like thousands of horses.

565
00:32:15,791 --> 00:32:18,923
Speaker 1: And you can read in the article more details, right, about that.

566
00:32:21,030 --> 00:32:23,410
Speaker 1: But they have to replace the engine.

567
00:32:23,870 --> 00:32:26,990
Speaker 1: So, they dock the boat and they cut a hole in the side of the ship.

568
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,209
Speaker 1: And they're going to take one engine out and put the other one in.

569
00:32:30,352 --> 00:32:32,590
Speaker 1: But the thing is, they're publicly documenting all this.

570
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:33,910
Speaker 1: None of it's like secret, right?

571
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:36,630
Speaker 1: If you can, if you follow like a military warship.

572
00:32:37,411 --> 00:32:44,030
Speaker 1: No, if you follow the Coast Guard on like, you know, whatever their place you follow them is, Facebook, Instagram, I don't know, wherever they're documenting this.

573
00:32:44,172 --> 00:32:44,909
Speaker 1: I just read an article.

574
00:32:46,034 --> 00:32:47,449
Speaker 1: You can, they're giving out all the deets.

575
00:32:47,691 --> 00:32:55,470
Speaker 1: And the most fascinating thing is something that like, you know, because like a lot of the stuff is detailed, nerdy boat stuff that you can't really relate to, right.

576
00:32:55,891 --> 00:33:02,210
Speaker 1: But the thing I could really relate to so much was they put the boat into the dock, right?

577
00:33:02,330 --> 00:33:04,190
Speaker 1: Like the dry dock is not in the water anymore.

578
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:07,750
Speaker 1: It's up on land in a big, you know, big hole in the ground, right?

579
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:08,388
Speaker 1: That's boat shaped.

580
00:33:09,111 --> 00:33:13,950
Speaker 1: They had to put it in and put the boat as far to the right as they could.

581
00:33:14,771 --> 00:33:20,349
Speaker 1: To create room so that when they take the engine out of the side of the boat, they can lift it up, right.

582
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:21,710
Speaker 1: And get it out of the hole.

583
00:33:21,850 --> 00:33:27,526
Speaker 0: I love hearing about those like very specific, practical challenges that are a reality for jobs that we never see.

584
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:34,769
Speaker 1: And it's just like, how many times you're working on something and it's like, okay, I got like this screw out, but now it's stuck down there and I can't get it.

585
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:39,190
Speaker 0: You know, like flashbacks to trying to like replace Ram and like old computers.

586
00:33:40,318 --> 00:33:40,530
Speaker 1: Yeah.

587
00:33:40,550 --> 00:33:44,550
Speaker 1: It's like, you got to get in something into a tight space and it's like, you need to make the tight space bigger.

588
00:33:44,710 --> 00:33:49,110
Speaker 1: Move the, you know, it's like even with something this big, they have that problem, but they were so smart.

589
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:53,830
Speaker 1: They a foresaw the problem to begin with, accounted for it.

590
00:33:54,413 --> 00:33:56,169
Speaker 1: And I guess they, they have enough room.

591
00:33:56,551 --> 00:33:59,170
Speaker 0: So they're barely look at these pictures.

592
00:33:59,310 --> 00:33:59,868
Speaker 0: Good God.

593
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:00,184
Speaker 0: Yeah.

594
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:03,450
Speaker 1: This, the photos are showing you, like we moved it all the way.

595
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:04,650
Speaker 1: Look how it's so close.

596
00:34:04,791 --> 00:34:14,529
Speaker 1: It is, you know, and plus when they were docking the boat, they probably like imagine having to like move it, just get it into just the right spot and not let it, you know, before you take the water out.

597
00:34:15,190 --> 00:34:23,810
Speaker 0: You know, this is always the kind of thing where like no one in high school ever told me I could be gigantic boat repair guy as a career because not many people can.

598
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,748
Speaker 1: There's only one, like a few places on earth where you can be that.

599
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:29,909
Speaker 1: It's not like a common job.

600
00:34:30,052 --> 00:34:31,029
Speaker 1: It's a rare job.

601
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:33,649
Speaker 1: It's like a very select list of people get that job.

602
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:37,230
Speaker 1: And usually it's people who a live near it to begin with.

603
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,087
Speaker 1: So they know about it.

604
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:41,368
Speaker 1: You know, coast guard people, you know.

605
00:34:42,451 --> 00:34:54,870
Speaker 1: I think that's the real thing is like, if you are not, if you don't like join something like the coast guard, right, they don't tell you necessarily all the possible jobs you could have in, in that organization.

606
00:34:55,130 --> 00:35:00,050
Speaker 0: A lot of these jobs are joined an organization or get an apprenticeship that no one will ever tell you exists.

607
00:35:00,792 --> 00:35:10,450
Speaker 1: And also, I mean, I remember when I was in high school and I guess, you know, slightly less against joining, say a military organization that I am now, right.

608
00:35:10,551 --> 00:35:11,870
Speaker 1: I was already extremely against.

609
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:17,050
Speaker 1: I was like, whenever army recruiters, like the few times that I actually engaged with them, right.

610
00:35:17,090 --> 00:35:36,948
Speaker 1: In any meaningful way, I was like, I was like, if I joined the army or whatever, can you guarantee that I will not have to do any pushups and also that I can get a computer job guaranteed, not a killing people job, not a gun job, not, and not a computer that shoots bombs job, you know, some sort of other computer job that does not involve murdering people.

611
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,529
Speaker 0: I'm sure that recruiters say, yes, I just lied to you.

612
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:40,670
Speaker 1: No, they didn't.

613
00:35:40,810 --> 00:35:42,829
Speaker 1: They were like, no, you got to go to basic training.

614
00:35:43,090 --> 00:35:45,830
Speaker 0: No matter what is the Marine recruiters straight up lied to me.

615
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:46,527
Speaker 0: It was really funny.

616
00:35:47,331 --> 00:35:47,564
Speaker 1: Okay.

617
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:51,310
Speaker 1: But they can't guarantee you that job.

618
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:56,126
Speaker 1: So it's like, if you told me, oh, you joined the Coast Guard, your guaranteed job is engine replacer, right?

619
00:35:56,871 --> 00:36:02,049
Speaker 1: Maybe I would sign up for Coast Guard, but no, you joined the Coast Guard and then who knows what it's going to have.

620
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:14,010
Speaker 0: But imagine if we had organizations like the Coast Guard that were paid better and like more managed by society and invested in to do other kinds of big infrastructure for our country, the train Corps.

621
00:36:14,150 --> 00:36:15,089
Speaker 0: I want to join the train Corps.

622
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:20,550
Speaker 1: Well, imagine if you could just guarantee, join Coast Guard and not have to do pushups or kill anybody.

623
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:23,499
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm fine doing pushups and the Coast Guard doesn't have to kill that many people.

624
00:36:25,514 --> 00:36:26,829
Speaker 1: One is too many is the problem.

625
00:36:30,258 --> 00:36:30,730
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

626
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:46,510
Speaker 0: The best part of this article is, uh, the Coast Guard, the, the, the engine they're placing that they put in, they built that spare engine when they built the ship 23 years ago and they built a special building around that engine to store it until this day.

627
00:36:47,704 --> 00:36:47,830
Speaker 1: Yep.

628
00:36:48,412 --> 00:36:50,270
Speaker 0: I don't know what they'll do if they have another engine problem.

629
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,809
Speaker 0: I think they may build a new engine at that point.

630
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:57,930
Speaker 1: They'll probably, they'll probably, the one they're taking out, they'll probably, you know, put in a building.

631
00:36:58,073 --> 00:36:58,310
Speaker 0: Yeah.

632
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:58,615
Speaker 1: Yeah.

633
00:36:59,652 --> 00:37:00,788
Speaker 1: You know, so you always have one good one.

634
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:13,780
Speaker 0: I'll admit, I, in terms of like the weird stuff I know about, I know a lot more about nuclear propulsion than about just non-nuclear electric propulsion, even though lots of the parts are very similar because Russia's got

635
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,370
Speaker 1: some Russia except the plutonium part, Russian

636
00:37:16,711 --> 00:37:20,330
Speaker 0: equivalent ships to this are nuclear powered icebreakers and they're neat.

637
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:21,862
Speaker 1: Of course.

638
00:37:23,672 --> 00:37:28,070
Speaker 0: But anyway, met a moment, uh, I've not blit the tale of Genji signal yet.

639
00:37:28,450 --> 00:37:29,070
Speaker 0: Nara Scott.

640
00:37:30,023 --> 00:37:30,170
Speaker 1: Nope.

641
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,189
Speaker 0: Our code of conduct seems to be working.

642
00:37:32,531 --> 00:37:36,810
Speaker 0: People have new people have come back into the forum or like, like there's more activity.

643
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:43,689
Speaker 0: I feel like if you have stayed away from geek nights, community spaces for some time, for whatever reason, come on back in and see what's going on.

644
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:48,227
Speaker 0: We're trying to shape the community a little bit more specifically and it's bearing some fruit.

645
00:37:48,711 --> 00:37:50,206
Speaker 1: And also if you're a time of year, yeah.

646
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:59,849
Speaker 1: Now is the time of year when usually you're with people, you know, we can't necessarily, it's not safe to be with people as much as we have been in a normal year.

647
00:38:00,751 --> 00:38:03,408
Speaker 1: You can be with fellow if you're listening to this, right?

648
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:10,750
Speaker 1: I guess you are fellows in some way or, you know, you are, you should get along with other people who also listen to this, right?

649
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:14,609
Speaker 1: So, you know, uh, so that's a thing.

650
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:16,849
Speaker 1: Uh, what else?

651
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:33,490
Speaker 1: Oh, uh, uh, so far during my not working time, which will, I guess I'm gonna have seven days of working coming starting next week, but most of my not working time I've been spending working on making the Geek Nights website deploy itself with the press of a button and I've made a lot of progress.

652
00:38:33,774 --> 00:38:34,670
Speaker 1: It's almost done actually.

653
00:38:35,691 --> 00:38:40,430
Speaker 1: So if that is done, then working on the Geek Nights website will be a breeze, right?

654
00:38:40,490 --> 00:38:44,250
Speaker 1: I'll be able to just be like, you know, making all kinds of changes, all kinds of stuff constantly.

655
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,649
Speaker 0: You know, that's the pattern with you and me.

656
00:38:46,070 --> 00:38:50,027
Speaker 0: The part, the boring part that's necessary to get to the fun part is what slows us down the most.

657
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:55,607
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm telling you, it's like once you have, you know, like a, like a factory, right?

658
00:38:57,133 --> 00:39:06,025
Speaker 0: To make a thing, then suddenly making the thing becomes like, oh, that's why we have to make it a lot of video content because the factory has to be rebuilt every time we do it.

659
00:39:07,050 --> 00:39:07,689
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

660
00:39:09,512 --> 00:39:23,890
Speaker 1: Um, yeah, otherwise, but yeah, so if you, the, the, that was trying to say I got distracted by something, uh, is if you or someone, you know, or you just know of someone who is great at front end web action.

661
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:32,730
Speaker 1: We're talking about, you know, real simple, like in terms of programming wise, all you're going to have to do is like, you know, call real simple APIs and get results.

662
00:39:32,971 --> 00:39:37,070
Speaker 1: And then the hard part is making a nice looking webpage, right?

663
00:39:37,470 --> 00:39:41,790
Speaker 1: Real nice looking, very, uh, meeting accessibility standards, right?

664
00:39:42,654 --> 00:39:43,649
Speaker 1: All that sort of stuff.

665
00:39:44,492 --> 00:39:47,190
Speaker 1: Um, not the actual programming part, the artsy part.

666
00:39:47,973 --> 00:39:50,530
Speaker 1: We do have a new logo and graphic design.

667
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:53,229
Speaker 1: We just need, you know, the website at rest in peace.

668
00:39:53,472 --> 00:39:54,750
Speaker 0: Logos by Brando Kay.

669
00:39:55,411 --> 00:39:57,770
Speaker 0: They served us well for 15 plus years.

670
00:39:59,210 --> 00:40:01,570
Speaker 1: When I, I think I read what Brando Kay is up to these days.

671
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:09,790
Speaker 1: He was on the team that did the RBs, uh, Twitter account, but I think they're doing something else now, but very talented person, uh, regardless.

672
00:40:10,034 --> 00:40:10,098
Speaker 1: Yep.

673
00:40:10,752 --> 00:40:14,134
Speaker 0: Uh, we're going to, we're going to give up on our web 2.0.

674
00:40:14,134 --> 00:40:14,670
Speaker 0: That's right.

675
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:20,890
Speaker 1: So if you know of anyone who is good at HTML, CSS, not too much JavaScript, right?

676
00:40:21,072 --> 00:40:22,809
Speaker 1: Mostly making stuff look nice.

677
00:40:23,470 --> 00:40:24,549
Speaker 1: Web page, right?

678
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,349
Speaker 1: Uh, refer that person to us.

679
00:40:27,691 --> 00:40:28,229
Speaker 0: We will pay.

680
00:40:28,390 --> 00:40:29,810
Speaker 0: This is not, we're not asking for volunteers.

681
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:31,930
Speaker 0: This is a paid like contract.

682
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:40,349
Speaker 1: We are going to pay that person a competitive, perhaps even generous rate of money, uh, from mostly rims wallet.

683
00:40:40,612 --> 00:40:41,550
Speaker 0: Well, and the Patriot.

684
00:40:42,614 --> 00:40:43,310
Speaker 1: Steal rims money.

685
00:40:44,391 --> 00:40:50,349
Speaker 0: We, uh, yeah, we're paying for, well, this is a, this is a pretty good job, honestly, if you feel like you're up to it.

686
00:40:50,972 --> 00:40:52,290
Speaker 1: It's only a one time job though.

687
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,290
Speaker 1: It's not an ongoing job.

688
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,909
Speaker 0: It is a contract that will end.

689
00:40:55,110 --> 00:40:57,710
Speaker 0: We do not need someone to help us maintain the site after it's live.

690
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:58,665
Speaker 0: Yes.

691
00:40:58,970 --> 00:40:59,790
Speaker 0: Cause we can do that.

692
00:40:59,950 --> 00:41:01,730
Speaker 0: We're just, we could make the whole site ourselves.

693
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:05,330
Speaker 0: One, we just suck at design and two front end development sucks ass.

694
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:05,787
Speaker 0: And I hate it.

695
00:41:05,951 --> 00:41:06,566
Speaker 0: I hate doing it.

696
00:41:06,791 --> 00:41:08,087
Speaker 0: I never want to touch CSS.

697
00:41:09,479 --> 00:41:10,410
Speaker 1: It's better than it used to be.

698
00:41:10,510 --> 00:41:14,470
Speaker 1: Cause it's browsers today have things like CSS grid and whatnot, but that is true.

699
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:16,966
Speaker 0: But I still just don't like doing it.

700
00:41:17,795 --> 00:41:18,509
Speaker 1: No, I don't like doing it.

701
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:19,827
Speaker 0: I don't like thinking about it.

702
00:41:21,592 --> 00:41:23,287
Speaker 1: That's we're going to pay someone else to do it.

703
00:41:24,054 --> 00:41:24,430
Speaker 0: All right.

704
00:41:24,610 --> 00:41:30,330
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's get right into it because, uh, this has turned into the adventure time show because we've now had two of these posts.

705
00:41:30,751 --> 00:41:33,830
Speaker 0: It's, uh, end of adventure time episodes on HBO max.

706
00:41:34,211 --> 00:41:36,850
Speaker 0: The first one was BMO, which we reviewed this one obsidian.

707
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:39,429
Speaker 0: It's the Marceline and bubble gum show.

708
00:41:40,232 --> 00:41:47,070
Speaker 0: The biggest thing I have to tell you about this before we start reviewing it is that with the BMO one it's it stands alone.

709
00:41:47,331 --> 00:41:50,410
Speaker 0: You could watch it knowing nothing about adventure time and enjoy it.

710
00:41:50,873 --> 00:41:53,030
Speaker 0: Like it, it's, it's a story from start to finish.

711
00:41:53,772 --> 00:41:56,290
Speaker 0: This one won't make any goddamn sense.

712
00:41:56,511 --> 00:42:02,309
Speaker 0: If you have not seen all of adventure time to end it will spoil everything.

713
00:42:05,035 --> 00:42:07,150
Speaker 1: So I, uh, partially agree.

714
00:42:07,496 --> 00:42:08,050
Speaker 1: A you're right.

715
00:42:08,131 --> 00:42:09,388
Speaker 1: It will spoil many things.

716
00:42:10,714 --> 00:42:11,950
Speaker 1: B yes, you are right.

717
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:15,470
Speaker 1: There was a lot going on here that you will not understand at all.

718
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:17,890
Speaker 0: If you haven't seen all of it, but no, I see what you're about to say.

719
00:42:18,451 --> 00:42:25,490
Speaker 1: But see, it is watchable and comprehensible, uh, as a standalone thing.

720
00:42:25,590 --> 00:42:30,790
Speaker 1: You can understand what is happening in this within itself.

721
00:42:31,110 --> 00:42:31,206
Speaker 0: Yeah.

722
00:42:31,335 --> 00:42:31,507
Speaker 0: Right.

723
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:40,950
Speaker 0: Like when Marceline is singing a particular song at a certain point, the way bubble gum reacts and then a flashback, you can figure out the context of that story enough.

724
00:42:41,811 --> 00:42:48,450
Speaker 1: You can, but I'm saying that the basic plot of this is that there is this glass kingdom, which is not in any other adventure time.

725
00:42:48,590 --> 00:42:58,670
Speaker 0: It's a brand new kingdom as far as we're aware of, but it is canonically foreshadowed, even if it's a retcon based on how Marceline was first introduced in the beginning.

726
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:00,430
Speaker 1: Yes, sure.

727
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:03,650
Speaker 1: Um, but yeah, this is not a kingdom we've seen before.

728
00:43:03,730 --> 00:43:04,416
Speaker 1: These aren't characters.

729
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:05,244
Speaker 1: you've seen before this.

730
00:43:06,010 --> 00:43:11,889
Speaker 1: You find out the story of the glass kingdom is there's a dragon that lives down in the lava and they trap it there.

731
00:43:12,035 --> 00:43:12,329
Speaker 1: Right.

732
00:43:13,532 --> 00:43:22,770
Speaker 1: And then the, the dragons waking up and there's a, there's a kid and, you know, there's a princess goes off to find the ancient hero that saved the day the last time this happened.

733
00:43:23,742 --> 00:43:23,950
Speaker 1: Right.

734
00:43:24,331 --> 00:43:24,872
Speaker 1: It's like that.

735
00:43:24,973 --> 00:43:46,650
Speaker 1: the plot of this thing itself, you can fully grasp from never having seen any adventure time in your whole damn life, but there is much more fan service, you know, you know, plot stuff that you really probably shouldn't watch this unless you've seen all of adventure time enough, all the plot episodes of adventure time.

736
00:43:47,491 --> 00:43:51,390
Speaker 0: Like it'll literally spoil major points about the end of adventure time.

737
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:56,210
Speaker 0: And it is set like at least a decade, maybe two after the end of adventure time.

738
00:43:56,970 --> 00:44:07,910
Speaker 1: And some things, you know, some things are, you know, references to the TV show that you will not get, and that won't necessarily subtract from watching this.

739
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:23,970
Speaker 1: So, but some things, if you don't get it will, uh, you might, you'll miss something and it won't necessarily make the experience of watching it worse, but you'll basically be losing a huge bonus.

740
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:24,075
Speaker 1: Right.

741
00:44:24,390 --> 00:44:28,830
Speaker 1: It's like, there's a scene where someone throws a t-shirt at someone that scene.

742
00:44:29,272 --> 00:44:35,350
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, if you don't know anything about adventure time, that scene won't really cause you any problems.

743
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:41,290
Speaker 0: It won't make this, you know, movie, I guess the one part that would make no sense to anyone is anything to do with Simon.

744
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:43,591
Speaker 0: Sure.

745
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:47,640
Speaker 0: That is not, they don't even try to make that make sense.

746
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,400
Speaker 0: You'll just be like, the fuck was he doing with the freezer?

747
00:44:50,861 --> 00:44:52,237
Speaker 0: What's going on with that guy?

748
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:53,530
Speaker 1: Yeah.

749
00:44:54,948 --> 00:44:55,180
Speaker 1: Yeah.

750
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,060
Speaker 1: It's just some guy, you know, doing weird stuff.

751
00:44:57,682 --> 00:45:10,379
Speaker 0: Like a lot of the emotional touchstones of adventure time, distant lands, obsidian really rely on you knowing the history of the show because you have all this context about the relationship between Bubblegum and Marceline from the show.

752
00:45:11,140 --> 00:45:20,762
Speaker 0: And it's not necessarily like, oh, now I know the answer as to X, Y, and Z. It's more like you get a complete emotional picture of those characters and their final arcs.

753
00:45:20,984 --> 00:45:23,560
Speaker 0: that would definitely be lost on you if you had not seen the show.

754
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:24,820
Speaker 1: Yep.

755
00:45:25,201 --> 00:45:26,699
Speaker 1: They sort of fill in blanks.

756
00:45:27,065 --> 00:45:27,920
Speaker 1: That didn't exist.

757
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,659
Speaker 1: So it's like, there weren't really like plot holes to fill in.

758
00:45:32,981 --> 00:45:36,340
Speaker 1: But it's sort of like Marceline's mother already in the show.

759
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:39,020
Speaker 0: She came up several times and it was kind of left as is.

760
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:50,075
Speaker 0: This doesn't reveal shocking new information about her mom, but it reveals a heartwarming and interesting emotional arc about her mom and the context of how she became who she was.

761
00:45:50,360 --> 00:45:50,530
Speaker 1: Right.

762
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:52,620
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, we already have this thing.

763
00:45:52,821 --> 00:45:56,700
Speaker 1: Let's just explain that thing some more than we explained it before.

764
00:45:57,380 --> 00:46:03,640
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, you know, A, B, and C. You know that you don't need to know more than A, B, and C. It's not a whole.

765
00:46:04,040 --> 00:46:05,999
Speaker 1: It's not lacking in the original show.

766
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:06,658
Speaker 1: Right.

767
00:46:07,081 --> 00:46:08,980
Speaker 1: But we're just going to add some more details.

768
00:46:09,020 --> 00:46:17,300
Speaker 1: We're going to add D, E, and F just to flesh that out, you know, color in between the lines a bit there, you know, and now you'll know even more.

769
00:46:17,661 --> 00:46:29,880
Speaker 1: And it's not really any different or, you know, but it's just a thing that will make someone who's a fan feel good with some fan service, but also, you know, add more to the characters and whatnot.

770
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:39,758
Speaker 0: It does also serve to do something that, as you know, the history of Adventure Time, they really weren't allowed to explore the lesbian relationship between Marceline and Bubblegum in the show.

771
00:46:39,940 --> 00:46:44,138
Speaker 0: Like they couldn't continue what they started with that one episode.

772
00:46:44,158 --> 00:46:45,379
Speaker 0: that sort of really kicked that off.

773
00:46:45,784 --> 00:46:46,879
Speaker 0: They weren't allowed to.

774
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,880
Speaker 0: Like it was a different time and that sucks.

775
00:46:49,282 --> 00:46:52,820
Speaker 0: And they barely like got to the point at the end where they could have them kiss on screen.

776
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,120
Speaker 0: Part of what this episode seems to do is revel in their relationship.

777
00:46:58,340 --> 00:47:00,820
Speaker 0: Like they don't have to dance around any of it.

778
00:47:01,141 --> 00:47:03,780
Speaker 0: They dive into their relationship like they're just living together.

779
00:47:04,163 --> 00:47:05,099
Speaker 0: That is just fine.

780
00:47:06,561 --> 00:47:15,780
Speaker 0: I feel like it is partly not a repudiation of the decisions that were made by the company previously, but more like a conclusion like this is how far we've come.

781
00:47:16,860 --> 00:47:16,924
Speaker 1: Hmm.

782
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:18,485
Speaker 1: Yeah.

783
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,900
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just like, okay, we can do this now, so we're going to do it.

784
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:24,120
Speaker 1: They don't like go overboard with it.

785
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:26,020
Speaker 1: Like, oh yeah, we can do this now.

786
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:26,720
Speaker 1: Let's do right.

787
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:29,440
Speaker 1: But it's just sort of like, okay, we can do this now.

788
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:33,220
Speaker 1: If we had been allowed to do this all along and this was a normal thing to do.

789
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:34,399
Speaker 0: This is what it would have been.

790
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:36,197
Speaker 1: This is what it would have been.

791
00:47:36,782 --> 00:47:38,559
Speaker 1: So we're now we're on HBO Max.

792
00:47:39,064 --> 00:47:39,780
Speaker 1: We can do it.

793
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:40,778
Speaker 1: We must do it.

794
00:47:41,304 --> 00:47:42,018
Speaker 1: And they did do it.

795
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:42,248
Speaker 0: Yep.

796
00:47:42,684 --> 00:47:44,080
Speaker 0: So Bobby's like, just go watch it.

797
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,755
Speaker 0: If you haven't, unless you haven't watched adventure time, which case?

798
00:47:46,815 --> 00:47:55,440
Speaker 0: just go watch that because I just want to talk about the parts we liked, which means we're going to spoil this, but by nature of talking about this, we're going to spoil a lot of adventure time.

799
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:03,700
Speaker 0: I I'm like 50 50 out of Jake is dead by this point based on just having that tattoo.

800
00:48:05,312 --> 00:48:05,480
Speaker 1: Yeah.

801
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:08,173
Speaker 1: Well, the tattoo and the fact that, uh, come right.

802
00:48:09,940 --> 00:48:11,399
Speaker 1: Jake didn't come in the, in the bus.

803
00:48:11,460 --> 00:48:11,629
Speaker 1: Yeah.

804
00:48:12,265 --> 00:48:13,460
Speaker 1: Jake's daughter came in the bus.

805
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:14,760
Speaker 0: No, that's not Jake's daughter.

806
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:15,880
Speaker 0: That's Jake's granddaughter.

807
00:48:16,080 --> 00:48:16,619
Speaker 0: That's Bonwin.

808
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:17,799
Speaker 0: The skateboard girl.

809
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:20,280
Speaker 0: That's Kim Kilwan's daughter.

810
00:48:21,081 --> 00:48:21,759
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

811
00:48:22,380 --> 00:48:23,320
Speaker 0: How do you not remember?

812
00:48:24,769 --> 00:48:26,080
Speaker 1: Cause Jake's family's too big.

813
00:48:26,260 --> 00:48:27,000
Speaker 1: I can't keep them straight.

814
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,340
Speaker 1: That is Kim Kilwan's daughter.

815
00:48:31,801 --> 00:48:37,020
Speaker 0: But, uh, I like how Finn definitely has a like Greg from Steven universe vibe going on now.

816
00:48:38,401 --> 00:48:43,438
Speaker 1: Well, I think the thing I like most is how, you know, clearly the voice actor for Finn got older.

817
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:43,832
Speaker 1: Right.

818
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:48,839
Speaker 1: And it's, they're basically just like, okay, he's probably like, ah, I can just talk normally now.

819
00:48:49,382 --> 00:48:51,559
Speaker 1: I not have to hide that I'm no longer a child.

820
00:48:52,202 --> 00:48:55,240
Speaker 1: Um, cause my character is no longer a child is the same character though.

821
00:48:55,581 --> 00:48:59,420
Speaker 1: I love all, you know, the voice, you know, he's got like what, two lines maybe, right?

822
00:48:59,860 --> 00:49:17,800
Speaker 0: The voice acting adventure time has always been a plus, but the voices in this one are particularly good, especially all the sort of catty, bitchy and like the side glass characters who were all being snide and mean the entire time are particularly funny in an LSP way.

823
00:49:17,903 --> 00:49:18,580
Speaker 0: that I appreciate.

824
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:26,079
Speaker 1: To go back to the Jake dead story, we know for a fact, however, that, uh, Jake's voice actor, the bender guy, what's his name?

825
00:49:26,943 --> 00:49:28,620
Speaker 1: I always forget his name when I need to remember it.

826
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:30,179
Speaker 1: But when I see his name, I'm like, that's that guy.

827
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:31,203
Speaker 1: Yes.

828
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:35,536
Speaker 1: As soon as I see that name, I know who it is, but I can't come up with his name when I need to.

829
00:49:36,340 --> 00:49:42,579
Speaker 1: Uh, we know for a fact that he is voice acting Jake in one of these, um, but we don't know when they're set.

830
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:47,080
Speaker 0: Cause remember BMO, the first one was set way before adventure time started.

831
00:49:47,383 --> 00:49:48,639
Speaker 0: This one is set way after.

832
00:49:48,981 --> 00:49:52,332
Speaker 0: So he could be acting way after maybe like 10, 20 years after.

833
00:49:52,332 --> 00:49:52,974
Speaker 1: 10 or 20 years after.

834
00:49:54,820 --> 00:49:54,937
Speaker 1: Yeah.

835
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:55,859
Speaker 1: It's not too far after.

836
00:49:55,960 --> 00:50:01,040
Speaker 0: I mean, the first one is set 10 or 20 years before because BMO meets baby Finn.

837
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:02,874
Speaker 1: Yes.

838
00:50:04,382 --> 00:50:17,439
Speaker 1: So 10 years after, if something has happened to Jake, which they seem to be alluding to in that final brief moments of this movie, I think there's almost a guarantee that the before the episode, we're going to see that happen.

839
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,519
Speaker 1: The fourth fin Jake episode will be about that.

840
00:50:20,703 --> 00:50:21,036
Speaker 1: Yes.

841
00:50:21,722 --> 00:50:24,280
Speaker 1: Almost guaranteed high likelihood.

842
00:50:24,425 --> 00:50:25,160
Speaker 1: But I'm 50.

843
00:50:25,160 --> 00:50:30,620
Speaker 0: I'm literally 50 50 on that tattoo is because he is dead or that tattoo is just because that's how Finn rolls.

844
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:33,020
Speaker 1: It could be just how Finn rolls.

845
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:41,460
Speaker 1: It could also be, I don't know, you know, not dead, but like, you know, there's the whole Prismo sleeping Jake situation, which I kind of, right.

846
00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:49,800
Speaker 0: I did notice that you see one of those futuristic looking banana guards briefly in a scene.

847
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:50,717
Speaker 1: I did not notice that.

848
00:50:51,825 --> 00:50:55,220
Speaker 0: Other times we see them are in Grebel's in the future.

849
00:50:55,523 --> 00:50:56,857
Speaker 0: After the fall of the candy kingdom.

850
00:50:57,801 --> 00:50:57,843
Speaker 1: No.

851
00:50:58,948 --> 00:50:59,178
Speaker 1: Okay.

852
00:50:59,803 --> 00:51:00,072
Speaker 0: There's a lot.

853
00:51:01,003 --> 00:51:02,320
Speaker 1: That is the thing, right?

854
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:06,660
Speaker 1: Is that they, um, bubbling are living in a Marceline shack.

855
00:51:06,821 --> 00:51:08,759
Speaker 1: They are not living in the candy kingdom.

856
00:51:09,132 --> 00:51:09,259
Speaker 0: Yep.

857
00:51:09,400 --> 00:51:11,660
Speaker 0: But the candy kingdom is still fine at this point.

858
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,999
Speaker 1: There must, there must be because there's banana guards.

859
00:51:14,081 --> 00:51:14,230
Speaker 1: Yeah.

860
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:15,620
Speaker 1: We assume it must be there.

861
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:17,559
Speaker 1: No one, you know, there's no indication that it's not.

862
00:51:17,941 --> 00:51:23,599
Speaker 0: But there's the newer banana guards that we see later in the Grebel's in the, uh, and the lemon hope episodes.

863
00:51:24,680 --> 00:51:24,780
Speaker 1: Yep.

864
00:51:25,844 --> 00:51:27,240
Speaker 1: Why can't episode three be lemon gray?

865
00:51:27,921 --> 00:51:30,420
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, as much as I want that, I'm still excited.

866
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,239
Speaker 0: Cause you know, you remember what episode three is, right?

867
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,100
Speaker 0: Baby Peppermint Butler goes to wizard school to relearn dark magic.

868
00:51:37,808 --> 00:51:37,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

869
00:51:38,061 --> 00:51:39,420
Speaker 1: That's a high, that's high up there.

870
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:42,480
Speaker 1: Oh, so, uh, how could I forget to mention, right?

871
00:51:42,720 --> 00:51:45,700
Speaker 0: So the very beginning, I was avoiding bringing it up on purpose.

872
00:51:46,522 --> 00:51:49,280
Speaker 1: The very beginning of this fucking movie, right?

873
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:55,219
Speaker 1: Glass boy is trying, you know, escape the glass kingdom and is going to go out into the world to try to find a Marceline.

874
00:51:55,480 --> 00:51:56,400
Speaker 1: They do it pretty quickly.

875
00:51:56,602 --> 00:51:58,239
Speaker 1: Actually, he finds Marceline pretty easily.

876
00:52:00,303 --> 00:52:03,920
Speaker 1: Um, but, oh yeah, we know the candy came to exist because Simon's in the bar singing.

877
00:52:04,586 --> 00:52:05,299
Speaker 1: Uh, I forgot about that.

878
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:13,700
Speaker 1: Anyway, the first person that glass boy runs into in the woods, he runs into a mysterious figure hooded figure in the woods, right?

879
00:52:14,341 --> 00:52:15,420
Speaker 1: Who is that hooded figure?

880
00:52:15,480 --> 00:52:20,299
Speaker 1: And I'm thinking, I'm thinking like all the, it could be a LSP slicer.

881
00:52:21,164 --> 00:52:22,580
Speaker 1: It could be a lemon grab.

882
00:52:22,982 --> 00:52:25,360
Speaker 1: It could be, you know, they could go obscure.

883
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:26,260
Speaker 1: Who is the bubble?

884
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:27,194
Speaker 1: The bubble head guy.

885
00:52:28,747 --> 00:52:30,139
Speaker 1: Um, uh, what's his name?

886
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:30,979
Speaker 1: Didn't he die?

887
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,780
Speaker 1: The robot rattle rattle balls, rattle balls.

888
00:52:33,861 --> 00:52:36,260
Speaker 1: It could be like this could mysterious character in the woods.

889
00:52:36,340 --> 00:52:40,840
Speaker 1: It could be a freaking huntress wizard could be, I don't know anybody, right?

890
00:52:41,281 --> 00:52:45,760
Speaker 1: Instead, it was my favorite dude, the choose goose.

891
00:52:46,521 --> 00:52:47,817
Speaker 1: And I was like, Oh my God.

892
00:52:49,562 --> 00:52:54,460
Speaker 0: Small and floppy, but this was a tall and menacing juice goose with contraband.

893
00:52:55,560 --> 00:52:55,650
Speaker 1: Yeah.

894
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:58,220
Speaker 1: And so the moisturizer was contraband.

895
00:52:58,280 --> 00:53:00,840
Speaker 1: I don't know what's up with that, but I missed the truth.

896
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,780
Speaker 1: I was so a gas that that choose goose appeared.

897
00:53:04,281 --> 00:53:09,504
Speaker 1: I had to rewind to go back and listen to choose goose's rhyme a second time because I missed it.

898
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:12,239
Speaker 1: I was so excited to see my boy choose goose.

899
00:53:16,642 --> 00:53:19,460
Speaker 1: So that was, that was nice to see choose goose still around.

900
00:53:20,262 --> 00:53:22,060
Speaker 1: Um, why can't we get a whole choose goose episode?

901
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,700
Speaker 1: It tells the story of choose goose.

902
00:53:23,720 --> 00:53:24,540
Speaker 0: That's the big thing I wonder.

903
00:53:25,561 --> 00:53:29,840
Speaker 0: I feel like distant lands is very popular and I feel like it's doing well for HBO max.

904
00:53:30,661 --> 00:53:32,658
Speaker 1: Well, it's going to do well for them because I pirated it.

905
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:33,371
Speaker 0: Yeah.

906
00:53:33,722 --> 00:53:35,420
Speaker 0: I also might've sailed the high seas.

907
00:53:35,600 --> 00:53:38,460
Speaker 0: My question is, I feel like I have to pay for it now.

908
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:40,080
Speaker 0: I'm going to be watching a venture venture.

909
00:53:40,763 --> 00:53:44,079
Speaker 0: If venture brothers makes it to HBO max, I will pay for HBO max.

910
00:53:44,642 --> 00:53:47,499
Speaker 1: I mean, I already said, I'm probably going to end up, you know, at some point.

911
00:53:47,539 --> 00:53:49,000
Speaker 1: I only have one service at a time.

912
00:53:49,140 --> 00:53:53,178
Speaker 1: I got to probably turn off Netflix and turn on an HBO max is my next move when I make a move.

913
00:53:53,480 --> 00:54:05,579
Speaker 0: But I wonder if they will just keep making more adventure time, or I wonder if HBO max will want to keep funding it, but the creative teams will not want to continue making it.

914
00:54:06,001 --> 00:54:10,680
Speaker 0: I don't know how this is all going to shake down on one hand.

915
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:16,979
Speaker 0: This could just be like four episodes to try to get a bunch of people to HBO max with a popular property that's ended.

916
00:54:17,441 --> 00:54:22,474
Speaker 0: But on the other hand, it could be a situation where this is big and there's like a trial balloon.

917
00:54:22,943 --> 00:54:24,760
Speaker 0: And if it succeeds, they'll want to just keep making more.

918
00:54:26,941 --> 00:54:29,320
Speaker 0: Maybe because I would just keep watching adventure time.

919
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:38,620
Speaker 0: Like so far, these two episodes have not disappointed if they made an adventure time episode as good as these every few months for the next decade.

920
00:54:38,840 --> 00:54:40,637
Speaker 0: I'd probably watch them all and never get tired.

921
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's not much else we could really say.

922
00:54:47,960 --> 00:54:48,800
Speaker 0: I mean, just watch it.

923
00:54:48,940 --> 00:54:49,616
Speaker 0: It ain't even that long.

924
00:54:52,882 --> 00:54:57,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't think we'll do a geek night's episode on like each of the two next ones.

925
00:54:57,543 --> 00:54:57,977
Speaker 1: Let's try it.

926
00:54:58,080 --> 00:54:59,100
Speaker 1: Maybe do one for both.

927
00:54:59,500 --> 00:54:59,960
Speaker 0: Try to combine them.

928
00:55:00,742 --> 00:55:08,780
Speaker 1: Unless if there is the threat of too many of these happening, we risk turning Geek Nights Wednesday into Adventure Time.

929
00:55:10,923 --> 00:55:12,619
Speaker 0: Yeah, Radio Free Equestria part two.

930
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:14,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

931
00:55:14,441 --> 00:55:15,839
Speaker 1: I don't want to go down that road.

932
00:55:18,783 --> 00:55:20,920
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

933
00:55:21,120 --> 00:55:26,059
Speaker 0: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design and Brando K for the logos.

942
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:27,180
Speaker 0: So yeah, normally we wouldn't do a show on a night like tonight because usually we'd be doing holiday stuff, but it's kind of stuck at home.

943
00:56:27,805 --> 00:56:29,320
Speaker 0: Please don't fly anywhere.

944
00:56:29,540 --> 00:56:30,959
Speaker 0: Do not travel for this holiday.

945
00:56:31,140 --> 00:56:32,057
Speaker 0: It's a dangerous time.

946
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:36,560
Speaker 0: But whatever you're doing tomorrow, we might poke around online a little bit.

947
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:44,220
Speaker 0: You can hang out in the Geek Nights Discord if you're alone and look for people to share some company or virtual video mails with.

948
00:56:44,800 --> 00:56:52,479
Speaker 0: But now, I leave you with... Do the Mario!

949
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:55,260
Speaker 1: Swing your arms from side to side.

950

Speaker 1: It's the Mario!

Speaker 1: Do the Mario!

958
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:14,210
