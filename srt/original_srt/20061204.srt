1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,487
Speaker 1: It's Monday December 4th.

2
00:00:11,868 --> 00:00:14,277
Speaker 0: I'm rim and I'm Scott and this is geek nights.

3
00:00:14,859 --> 00:00:17,698
Speaker 1: tonight We talk a bit about the old days of internet video.

4
00:00:19,141 --> 00:00:20,157
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,143 --> 00:00:25,878
Speaker 1: So we're back after yet another exciting weekend here in geek house land.

6
00:00:25,898 --> 00:00:30,519
Speaker 0: Well It's the weekend of hey, everyone came over and messed up our house.

7
00:00:31,162 --> 00:00:33,573
Speaker 1: They didn't mess it up nearly so bad as they have in days past.

8
00:00:33,674 --> 00:00:35,060
Speaker 0: I think is they usually do.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:35,501
Speaker 0: It's

10
00:00:35,843 --> 00:00:57,253
Speaker 1: partly because the last several times people have come over we have bit by bit called them out on the messes They make and now some of them are taking it upon themselves to start to clean up some of the messes or to avoid making them though Despite the fact that we provided an infinite number of plastic cups and plastic plates These people used an inordinate number of non plastic dishes.

11
00:00:58,156 --> 00:00:59,420
Speaker 0: I don't know what the hell's up with that.

12
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:00,847
Speaker 0: I mean it didn't.

13
00:01:01,069 --> 00:01:07,940
Speaker 0: well that it's guys didn't get used too much But the they did use a lot of plastic cups, but many glass cups who were dirty.

14
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:08,746
Speaker 1: Here's what I don't get.

15
00:01:08,766 --> 00:01:10,619
Speaker 1: we had what like a 10 11 people in the house.

16
00:01:10,780 --> 00:01:15,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, there were like 40 plastic cups out and they were almost all used.

17
00:01:16,018 --> 00:01:18,083
Speaker 0: what the hell What is.

18
00:01:18,123 --> 00:01:21,660
Speaker 0: some people just take one plastic cup and that's it and use it over and over.

19
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,808
Speaker 0: I mean if you change beverages I can understand.

20
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:28,204
Speaker 1: I was about to say maybe 30 should be used not 40.

21
00:01:28,204 --> 00:01:32,868
Speaker 0: And that's if everyone drinks Three different beverages and remember this including me.

22
00:01:32,888 --> 00:01:34,131
Speaker 1: it's not like that was the whole weekend.

23
00:01:34,392 --> 00:01:37,020
Speaker 1: most people showed up Saturday afternoon evening.

24
00:01:37,542 --> 00:01:43,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact only Jess was here Friday, and she used a glass glass because I poured a drink into it.

25
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:44,784
Speaker 0: Yeah, we accounted for the glass.

26
00:01:44,824 --> 00:01:49,015
Speaker 0: glasses turns out like five to six or maybe even ten.

27
00:01:49,115 --> 00:01:51,489
Speaker 0: glasses were used by people We don't know.

28
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:59,408
Speaker 1: yep But a couple of that like I think Wyatt asked if he could drink his beer out of an actual glass Instead of out of a plastic cup and that was perfectly.

29
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:02,159
Speaker 0: we accounted for a few of them, but not all of them.

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of them were unaccounted for though the house was significantly less trash than usual.

31
00:02:06,981 --> 00:02:12,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's less trash than it has been in the past, but at the same time it hasn't been trashed recently.

32
00:02:12,681 --> 00:02:16,040
Speaker 0: So it was kind of like this hasn't happened in a while.

33
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:21,200
Speaker 1: Well the living room was half trash before anyone got there just from your wii stuff that you finally cleaned up.

34
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:23,152
Speaker 0: Well the wii stuff isn't trash.

35
00:02:23,212 --> 00:02:24,480
Speaker 0: It's you know just controllers.

36
00:02:25,461 --> 00:02:34,579
Speaker 1: Until right before everyone came the living room was strewn with wii boxes and gamecube and Controllers all over the place and dead batteries laying everywhere.

37
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,085
Speaker 0: They weren't dead battery saying ever.

38
00:02:36,105 --> 00:02:37,329
Speaker 0: there are two dead batteries.

39
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:38,935
Speaker 0: that rolled off the little thing on.

40
00:02:39,096 --> 00:02:42,600
Speaker 1: I picked up four four batteries individual battery.

41
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:48,280
Speaker 0: Maybe some of them fell out of the battery bay on Wednesday and those the trash is was in the wii bag.

42
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:51,592
Speaker 0: That from the Wii store, and it's still there.

43
00:02:51,673 --> 00:02:52,857
Speaker 0: cuz I didn't throw that bag out.

44
00:02:53,058 --> 00:02:56,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah Yeah, I actually you know it's kind of related.

45
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:58,073
Speaker 1: It's tech day science day.

46
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:02,672
Speaker 1: I worked Saturday morning Which is something I almost would never do.

47
00:03:02,712 --> 00:03:04,120
Speaker 0: I only did I would never work Saturday.

48
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:18,404
Speaker 1: Well, I did it cuz I wanted a day off that I hadn't put in for and they were kind of yeah We why you in that day, so I was like alright I'll work that Saturday if you give me an extra vacation day and give me that day off and Feed me and blah blah blah.

49
00:03:18,826 --> 00:03:25,987
Speaker 1: and they agreed to it mm-hmm Basically a four-day weekend, that's all right.

50
00:03:26,248 --> 00:03:30,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, even though you know four or five o'clock rolls around, and I'm like all right I gotta go.

51
00:03:30,866 --> 00:03:35,980
Speaker 1: you schedule me for eight hours today And my time is up and the person there got kind of mad.

52
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:42,140
Speaker 1: No, you have to stay till the jobs done, and I'm not that kind of person, so I totally didn't stay awesome.

53
00:03:43,383 --> 00:03:45,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would definitely not work Saturday.

54
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:52,494
Speaker 0: Well unless they paid me a shit ton of monies and I was actually doing something And I wouldn't stay a minute longer than I had.

55
00:03:52,615 --> 00:03:55,406
Speaker 0: oh no no no I'd be like here.

56
00:03:55,466 --> 00:03:56,894
Speaker 0: I am at exactly the time.

57
00:03:56,934 --> 00:03:57,818
Speaker 0: I'm supposed to get here.

58
00:03:57,839 --> 00:03:58,805
Speaker 1: well There have been other times.

59
00:03:58,826 --> 00:04:00,660
Speaker 1: They've tried to get me to work at night or on a weekend.

60
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,395
Speaker 1: They always say hey, are you free tomorrow night, and I'll say no.

61
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,685
Speaker 1: Or hey, what are you doing?

62
00:04:06,805 --> 00:04:08,873
Speaker 1: Are you gonna be around Saturday?

63
00:04:08,913 --> 00:04:10,679
Speaker 1: We kind of need some be like I have plans.

64
00:04:10,699 --> 00:04:16,440
Speaker 1: I Wonder what they'll notice when they realize that I always have plans and to when they realize that I'm not lying.

65
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,845
Speaker 1: I really do always have plans.

66
00:04:18,387 --> 00:04:26,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean what's up with those people who like get pressured into stuff by like a Harold and Harold and Kumar?

67
00:04:26,165 --> 00:04:28,814
Speaker 0: yeah exactly I mean there are people like you know what it is.

68
00:04:28,894 --> 00:04:30,740
Speaker 1: people are afraid of being fired.

69
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:35,617
Speaker 1: Yet I've realized that as long as you're good enough at your job to where you're not.

70
00:04:35,657 --> 00:04:36,440
Speaker 1: a total fuck-up.

71
00:04:36,962 --> 00:04:40,095
Speaker 1: Your company's not going to fire you unless they wanted to fire you anyway.

72
00:04:40,476 --> 00:04:43,520
Speaker 1: if you work harder No one's going to notice and no one's going to care.

73
00:04:44,063 --> 00:04:47,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I do nothing and no one seems to care.

74
00:04:47,562 --> 00:04:55,520
Speaker 0: So if you are the type of person who actually does work at work all day The only way you're gonna get fired is if there's layoffs or anything like that.

75
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:04,639
Speaker 1: Yeah I hate to say it But you know what matters a lot more than being good at your job being cool or personable or just generally having people in management like you and you know what else.

76
00:05:04,659 --> 00:05:11,977
Speaker 0: if Firing scares you that probably means you don't have enough skills to get another job easily.

77
00:05:12,017 --> 00:05:17,682
Speaker 0: if I was fired today I could have a new job next week that paid probably more than the job I have now.

78
00:05:17,742 --> 00:05:23,000
Speaker 0: yeah, so firing is not something I fear, but you're kind of hoping for it.

79
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:30,788
Speaker 0: Yeah, kinda, so if you are afraid of being think about your job right now If you have a job are you afraid of being fired?

80
00:05:31,009 --> 00:05:37,372
Speaker 0: if so you should be building your skills in your spare time Because you were in fucking trouble all right.

81
00:05:37,834 --> 00:05:39,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should get onto the news.

82
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,211
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll do an episode someday.

83
00:05:41,332 --> 00:05:44,679
Speaker 0: on sounds like a good episode So we didn't say it.

84
00:05:45,322 --> 00:05:50,980
Speaker 0: One more thing is we play D&D for the first time in a long time on Sunday, and we'll talk about it tomorrow.

85
00:05:51,044 --> 00:06:02,840
Speaker 1: Yeah Tomorrow is gonna be kind of a big show just because of the fact that we haven't talked about Role-playing games much since the burning wheel interview with Luke crane or the Luke crane interview about burning wheel however you want to phrase that.

86
00:06:03,462 --> 00:06:16,729
Speaker 1: But having played D&D again after a multi-year hiatus We got quite a bit to say about Dungeons & Dragons And I think we're going to do a whole bunch of episodes on it in the near future Possibly at least one tomorrow.

87
00:06:17,171 --> 00:06:18,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, we had a geek back.

88
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,886
Speaker 1: We're gonna hold off on it.

89
00:06:19,946 --> 00:06:22,459
Speaker 1: Just cuz I forgot about it until just now.

90
00:06:23,042 --> 00:06:25,008
Speaker 1: Alright, I don't want to pull it up on the computer.

91
00:06:25,029 --> 00:06:26,474
Speaker 0: I pull it up when it's relevant.

92
00:06:26,715 --> 00:06:28,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, it'll never be relevant.

93
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:31,945
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, all right.

94
00:06:32,026 --> 00:06:36,600
Speaker 1: so in the British Isles in you know Britain and all that which one?

95
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:37,982
Speaker 1: Albion?

96
00:06:38,123 --> 00:06:39,650
Speaker 1: okay, so in Albion.

97
00:06:40,072 --> 00:06:47,239
Speaker 1: They have recently discovered a Roman casket an ancient Roman coffin with an ancient Roman body that is missing its head.

98
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:52,958
Speaker 1: Yeah, they talk a bit about why they think the heads missing, but it was on a stake out by the river.

99
00:06:53,439 --> 00:06:55,239
Speaker 0: now They're ward off pirates.

100
00:06:56,184 --> 00:06:59,418
Speaker 1: Yes, the pirates that came to Britain the Roman pirates.

101
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:06,780
Speaker 1: well I mean there were the Vikings and then the Normans and all the Roman pirates the Roman pirates.

102
00:07:08,322 --> 00:07:19,419
Speaker 1: Okay for those of you who know me I've been on a bit of a Roman history kick lately a bit of a cake More like a freaking boot to the with a rocket on it.

103
00:07:21,142 --> 00:07:23,108
Speaker 1: I am a kind of person who have something.

104
00:07:23,449 --> 00:07:24,753
Speaker 1: I generally my life.

105
00:07:25,134 --> 00:07:27,160
Speaker 1: I go about it in kind of an aimless fashion.

106
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:40,220
Speaker 1: I have long-term goals like rule the world become president have a podcast And I have short-term goals like eat this sandwich walk over there drink a soda.

107
00:07:41,562 --> 00:07:50,793
Speaker 1: the in-between the in-between is totally dependent upon the situations in which I find myself and I tend to take a fancy to something.

108
00:07:50,893 --> 00:07:58,195
Speaker 1: if I take a fancy to something I'll get really into it really quick And I'll probably forget about it really quick as well.

109
00:07:58,215 --> 00:08:03,000
Speaker 1: like a while ago Emily was learning Korean and I was trying to learn Korean - and I was really getting into it.

110
00:08:03,101 --> 00:08:12,320
Speaker 1: I learned Hangul and I was learning like I could or I could go to a restaurant and order things and I was doing okay like Early early basic beginner stuff, but I was doing alright.

111
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:15,758
Speaker 1: Since then I've totally forgotten Hangul.

112
00:08:16,802 --> 00:08:18,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah like a hundred percent.

113
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:20,973
Speaker 1: I can't I don't remember any of it.

114
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:23,580
Speaker 1: I vaguely remember how it's structured.

115
00:08:24,165 --> 00:08:25,538
Speaker 0: How about when you were reading all those?

116
00:08:25,941 --> 00:08:27,186
Speaker 0: Horatio hornblower thing.

117
00:08:27,226 --> 00:08:30,299
Speaker 1: No, the only reason that ended is because I finished all of them.

118
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,167
Speaker 1: That was a fancy that never ended.

119
00:08:33,227 --> 00:08:34,913
Speaker 1: I like her as your hornblower more than anything.

120
00:08:34,953 --> 00:08:36,919
Speaker 1: However, I am more than Rome.

121
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:50,071
Speaker 1: The the thing is with Horatio is that the books ended and the only outlet I have for my aggression now would be the Fan fiction archive a site that I'm not going to visit again.

122
00:08:50,091 --> 00:08:50,933
Speaker 1: Okay.

123
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:51,555
Speaker 0: Are you sure?

124
00:08:51,876 --> 00:08:58,500
Speaker 1: Yes, I'm sure I don't want to know Really goes to the Horatio hornblower fanfiction archive about how Horatio saved the furries.

125
00:09:02,825 --> 00:09:14,832
Speaker 1: Anyway But I ever since I started listening to my favorite podcast and also one of the first podcasts I ever listened to 12 Byzantine emperors consider this a plug.

126
00:09:14,853 --> 00:09:19,537
Speaker 1: the guy doesn't have a promo or anything But it is seriously the best podcast out there.

127
00:09:21,081 --> 00:09:27,616
Speaker 1: Agree but it's what would you say is the best podcast out there other than geek nights the best podcast there is anywhere.

128
00:09:27,636 --> 00:09:36,790
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean you can't say if it's not one that I had if it's what I don't listen to that would probably be dishonest It wouldn't it?

129
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:42,448
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably It's a tough call.

130
00:09:42,468 --> 00:09:44,520
Speaker 1: what's your favorite non geek nice podcast?

131
00:09:46,164 --> 00:09:47,359
Speaker 0: It's also a tough girl.

132
00:09:48,442 --> 00:09:50,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, we should probably do a show on that.

133
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,084
Speaker 1: We'll just do shows on everything.

134
00:09:52,204 --> 00:09:55,676
Speaker 1: but no 12 Byzantine emperors is an absolutely amazing podcast.

135
00:09:55,997 --> 00:09:56,800
Speaker 0: It is amazing.

136
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:57,443
Speaker 0: It's not the best.

137
00:09:57,504 --> 00:10:00,378
Speaker 1: and also I didn't know much about Byzantine history pretty much.

138
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:01,823
Speaker 0: I hate no shit

139
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:21,894
Speaker 1: from the time when Rome you know, like 476 a when Rome falls in popular history and everyone kind of ignored all the history after that other than like the Middle Ages crap and like Europe until suddenly the Renaissance and I really got off on that.

140
00:10:21,934 --> 00:10:27,792
Speaker 1: I really thought it was cool and I've been Voraciously finding any Roman and Byzantine history I can.

141
00:10:28,314 --> 00:10:31,744
Speaker 1: so when I saw this article now Yeah back on topic here.

142
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:35,234
Speaker 1: The article isn't that special in and of itself in that.

143
00:10:35,575 --> 00:10:37,180
Speaker 1: Oh, we found something Roman in Britain.

144
00:10:37,622 --> 00:10:41,540
Speaker 1: Well, the Romans colonize Britain and had stuff there for a long time.

145
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:42,222
Speaker 1: You can't.

146
00:10:42,263 --> 00:10:46,260
Speaker 1: you can just throw a spit and you'll hit something Roman in Britain.

147
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:54,840
Speaker 1: Well Albion, but the interesting thing is they found this body in a place where they didn't think Romans ever had permanent settlements.

148
00:10:55,761 --> 00:10:57,326
Speaker 0: Maybe it wasn't a permanent settlement.

149
00:10:57,386 --> 00:10:58,450
Speaker 0: It was like the guy died.

150
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,152
Speaker 0: They dropped him off.

151
00:10:59,172 --> 00:10:59,734
Speaker 0: They moved on.

152
00:11:00,075 --> 00:11:11,790
Speaker 1: Uh, no, no No It's more that there more and more evidence comes out that the Roman Empire was in many ways Even larger and more advanced than we realize.

153
00:11:12,452 --> 00:11:28,033
Speaker 1: and I guess my point here in this article is simply that Roman history as you might have learned in school or if you'll get if you read big coffee table books is interesting but a lot of it's kind of made up and They discover totally new things all the time.

154
00:11:28,314 --> 00:11:29,740
Speaker 1: We're still learning about Rome.

155
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:33,760
Speaker 1: There is no definitive answer as to just about anything involving that Empire.

156
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:38,886
Speaker 0: I think the problem with history is that there's just so much information even if you don't include the information we don't know yet.

157
00:11:39,107 --> 00:11:49,239
Speaker 0: There's so much information that we do know and I mean we could just spend all 12 grades of school teaching people about like one part of history and not finish it.

158
00:11:49,841 --> 00:11:57,700
Speaker 1: So when you leave stuff out it gets distorted greatly, you know Well also that we don't have a lot so we have to make things up and fill in the gaps.

159
00:11:58,041 --> 00:12:02,338
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but at least we make it something up that makes sense or is entertaining or interesting.

160
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:12,557
Speaker 1: Yeah like the time I slow I'd slain all the Dinosaurs living in the center of the earth just saving Dave and Joel's fast karate for the gentleman from certain doom.

161
00:12:12,778 --> 00:12:13,159
Speaker 0: Okay.

162
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:18,857
Speaker 1: Yeah I hate playing promos, but I want to promote other podcasts, but I'm done playing promos.

163
00:12:18,897 --> 00:12:19,760
Speaker 1: I just think they sound dumb.

164
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:20,242
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

165
00:12:20,262 --> 00:12:24,600
Speaker 1: All right, so I'm just gonna name podcast periodically that I like awesome.

166
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:39,240
Speaker 0: So there's a big deal now, you know the whole Microsoft novel deal that went down and people Are all going and this is gonna be like SEO round two and and blah blah blah blah blah.

167
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:43,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, Microsoft and these people basically made some deals the patents this suing that etc.

168
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:49,018
Speaker 1: It said it opens up the Linux community to a lot more bullshit than they're willing to deal with right now.

169
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:55,640
Speaker 0: Yeah so the latest Blow in this round is that novel?

170
00:12:56,461 --> 00:13:04,222
Speaker 0: Let's see novel put out a press release that says Novell boots open office and Microsoft Office Interoperability.

171
00:13:04,403 --> 00:13:08,139
Speaker 0: novel to support open XML format to advanced document interoperability.

172
00:13:08,179 --> 00:13:22,600
Speaker 0: So open office org, which is the Office suite of choice for open source peoples and that is free You can download from open office org for any operating system uses a format called open document format.

173
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:26,266
Speaker 0: It's an XML format And it's wide open.

174
00:13:26,386 --> 00:13:35,538
Speaker 0: if you wanted to make a piece of software that reads and writes open document format files It's pretty damn easy because this documentation that says this is how the files work.

175
00:13:35,658 --> 00:13:39,811
Speaker 0: Here it is Microsoft doesn't have open documents.

176
00:13:39,911 --> 00:13:47,080
Speaker 0: They have doc files and The latest version of doc files are the open XML format.

177
00:13:47,141 --> 00:13:57,902
Speaker 0: We notice the word open Which is not very open because there is no document that at least no document that is available to everyone that says This is how these files work 100%.

178
00:13:57,902 --> 00:13:58,945
Speaker 0: I mean this.

179
00:13:58,985 --> 00:14:13,740
Speaker 0: there's some documents that tell you a little bit how they work, but you cannot easily or legally really create a Program that can read and write Microsoft Office open XML format files like you can with open office files.

180
00:14:14,443 --> 00:14:16,251
Speaker 0: This is a big deal for many reasons.

181
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:24,865
Speaker 0: It's one of the reasons that Massachusetts is State of Massachusetts is thinking about moving to open document format and Many governments around the world.

182
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:41,362
Speaker 0: because if you don't use open document format or another opened up or another format which is truly open Then you're basically beholden to Microsoft as the only people who can provide software that can read your important The

183
00:14:41,382 --> 00:14:54,800
Speaker 1: reason Microsoft never embraces any of these open formats is simply that not many people would continue to use Microsoft Office Suites with their crazy high price tags if they weren't forced to by the fact that other people use them.

184
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:58,371
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like oh that guy over there made a document file.

185
00:14:58,752 --> 00:15:03,579
Speaker 0: The only program that can possibly read that file Properly, I mean there are ways to read it.

186
00:15:03,741 --> 00:15:05,939
Speaker 0: There's plenty of little converters and things, you know.

187
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:12,440
Speaker 0: But the only thing that can read it properly and edit it properly is open off is Microsoft Office.

188
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,923
Speaker 0: Jillian dollar.

189
00:15:13,943 --> 00:15:20,328
Speaker 1: there have been lawsuits and such where like say a state agency requires if you do something online You have to send a doc file.

190
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:22,500
Speaker 1: now think about that for a minute.

191
00:15:22,861 --> 00:15:38,340
Speaker 1: That means that in order to do the thing with the government that they're they're offering you have to purchase a third-party piece of software that is unrelated to the government in any way and You must do that in order to interface with your government the government you're paying for with your tax dollars.

192
00:15:38,581 --> 00:15:47,129
Speaker 0: It's exactly the same as if you were driving down the road and you wanted to make a right turn and it's a government public Road that your tax dollars paid for and they said no.

193
00:15:47,169 --> 00:15:49,578
Speaker 0: No, only Ford cars can drive on this road.

194
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:53,489
Speaker 0: Yeah It's a perfect analogy.

195
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:55,460
Speaker 0: if you don't agree, you don't understand technology.

196
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:59,488
Speaker 0: Anyway, what's happening here is Novell.

197
00:15:59,508 --> 00:16:04,580
Speaker 0: that first of all, you're gonna see the headlines all say Novell forking open office.

198
00:16:05,002 --> 00:16:05,565
Speaker 0: That's not true.

199
00:16:05,665 --> 00:16:15,565
Speaker 0: Novell forked open office org a while ago and If you use SUSE Linux the default open office actually like says Novell on it Because they did.

200
00:16:15,605 --> 00:16:16,669
Speaker 0: they forked it a while ago.

201
00:16:17,251 --> 00:16:28,420
Speaker 0: and the real open office, you know Since they they tend to take a lot of thick because the way the GPL works is you know If you write code into GPL software Then you you have to release it and people take it back.

202
00:16:28,540 --> 00:16:33,237
Speaker 0: And so the real open office looks at that one and uses it for their Linux build.

203
00:16:33,538 --> 00:16:33,839
Speaker 0: a lot.

204
00:16:34,621 --> 00:16:36,511
Speaker 0: Well, Novell has said all right.

205
00:16:36,551 --> 00:16:37,174
Speaker 0: This is what we're gonna do.

206
00:16:37,214 --> 00:16:42,237
Speaker 0: first We're gonna make a little plug-in interface for the R fork of open office.

207
00:16:42,579 --> 00:16:48,119
Speaker 0: All right They're gonna make a little plug-in interface and that plug-in interface will be open source as it is legally required to be.

208
00:16:48,661 --> 00:16:58,479
Speaker 0: Then we're gonna release a few plugins and you can put in that plug-in interface that will let you open and convert Microsoft Office open XML files really easily.

209
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:05,250
Speaker 0: Alright, you can do that too, you know, but they're not gonna open source the converters but they don't have to because of the way it works.

210
00:17:05,713 --> 00:17:11,071
Speaker 0: see a lot of people are like Oh, there's gonna be lawsuits and patents and all this and this is what they're worried about.

211
00:17:11,092 --> 00:17:18,740
Speaker 0: No, what they're really doing is this Microsoft realized that Vista is not really going to be the biggest hit in the universe.

212
00:17:19,261 --> 00:17:34,300
Speaker 0: So what they've done is they're saying alright the basic reasons that Linux can't make it on the corporate desktop is a lot of it Not being interoperable with Microsoft and its products that have already dominated the corporate desktop.

213
00:17:34,984 --> 00:17:37,560
Speaker 0: So what they've done is they basically bought out Novell.

214
00:17:38,061 --> 00:17:52,167
Speaker 0: they're gonna make SUSE Linux which is the Linux that Novell sort of owns kinda and They're gonna make it interoperable basically eliminating every other Linux's chance of Desktop movement in the corporate zone.

215
00:17:52,187 --> 00:17:56,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, luckily not that many people use any stuff anyway right now.

216
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:59,389
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of companies are moving toward Ubuntu.

217
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,820
Speaker 1: Ubuntu just because it's so easy and it just works.

218
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but those are only companies where there are smart people.

219
00:18:05,391 --> 00:18:05,592
Speaker 1: Yeah.

220
00:18:05,652 --> 00:18:07,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but things will change over time.

221
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:07,481
Speaker 1: Maybe.

222
00:18:07,501 --> 00:18:08,987
Speaker 1: look France is moving toward Linux.

223
00:18:09,028 --> 00:18:11,680
Speaker 1: I don't think they're gonna use any of this Novell business.

224
00:18:12,681 --> 00:18:24,794
Speaker 0: yeah, the thing is, you know, if you're a company and You know, you want to move to Linux and then you say hey this Linux over here This one works can read all my old documents and that one can't.

225
00:18:24,894 --> 00:18:25,978
Speaker 0: which one am I gonna use?

226
00:18:25,998 --> 00:18:28,809
Speaker 0: Oh I'm actually still tied into Microsoft.

227
00:18:28,849 --> 00:18:34,980
Speaker 0: I just think I'm cool because I'm using Linux now You know, it's really not the greatest thing in the world.

228
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:43,226
Speaker 1: Yeah There's really no easy answer except for people to actually stand up to Microsoft and say they're not gonna use their proprietary Document standards, which I don't.

229
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:45,232
Speaker 1: I haven't used Docs in forever.

230
00:18:45,252 --> 00:18:55,618
Speaker 0: Yeah me either but it seems like Obviously all the open source community people even the people who are less crazy like ourselves are going up.

231
00:18:55,698 --> 00:18:56,560
Speaker 0: fuck sues is done.

232
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:04,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, novella's done anything they do is basically like and a dragon's bane and we're not going near it.

233
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,188
Speaker 0: You gotta stay far away in spade.

234
00:19:06,368 --> 00:19:08,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would imply that we're dragons.

235
00:19:09,261 --> 00:19:15,558
Speaker 0: Well, you know if you're awesome enough to use open-source software and know about Linux, you might be awesome.

236
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:54,289
Speaker 1: dragon Man, I got to stop playing with this keyboard when I should be doing the show.

237
00:19:54,873 --> 00:19:56,683
Speaker 0: I'll just like cut the power wire on it.

238
00:19:56,703 --> 00:19:57,890
Speaker 0: Then you won't be able to do anything.

239
00:19:58,272 --> 00:19:59,417
Speaker 1: You know, I didn't even look.

240
00:19:59,437 --> 00:20:02,030
Speaker 1: I wonder if the power wire is the right one for the other compressor.

241
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:04,279
Speaker 1: The company is still out of stock.

242
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,002
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

243
00:20:05,022 --> 00:20:06,066
Speaker 0: Did you check recently?

244
00:20:06,206 --> 00:20:07,170
Speaker 1: I called him a week ago.

245
00:20:07,272 --> 00:20:08,917
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah We don't have any.

246
00:20:08,957 --> 00:20:13,681
Speaker 0: it doesn't look like it's the right one because that Transformer is real big and the one for that compressor was real small.

247
00:20:13,721 --> 00:20:14,363
Speaker 1: true true.

248
00:20:14,845 --> 00:20:16,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just thought of it suddenly.

249
00:20:16,772 --> 00:20:20,026
Speaker 1: But I can make such cheesy music with this thing.

250
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:21,090
Speaker 1: It's so fantastic.

251
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,709
Speaker 0: It's like the ultimate 80s box for sure.

252
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:36,530
Speaker 0: I mean if you just if you had one of these in someone's house in the 80s They wouldn't need to buy any cassette tapes, man If only we could have the consumer tech like this a decade early.

253
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:44,718
Speaker 0: Oh, so today we'd have the keyboard that makes 2000s music just perfectly like a push a button in like record company tech.

254
00:20:44,738 --> 00:20:54,350
Speaker 1: because seriously some of those Accompaniments and instruments built into this keyboard wouldn't sound out of place at all in an 80s movie soundtrack like straight up.

255
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I've heard these songs in movies before.

256
00:20:57,852 --> 00:21:03,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean seriously we could somehow get a keyboard that you know.

257
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,610
Speaker 0: We bring it to like a club push the buttons and all of a sudden we're the best DJ in the world.

258
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,146
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway things of the day oh shit.

259
00:21:12,468 --> 00:21:14,753
Speaker 1: so A while ago.

260
00:21:14,774 --> 00:21:20,068
Speaker 1: We had a thing of the day about a stupid criminal who kept falling through the roof and all sorts of hilarious hijinks.

261
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:31,389
Speaker 1: I was going to use as my thing of the day the Benny Hill remix of that but instead I Have to use this this wonderful gem of a criminal who?

262
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:36,130
Speaker 1: Broke into some dudes house naked in the middle of the night and fell asleep on the couch.

263
00:21:36,190 --> 00:21:38,804
Speaker 0: Well, it's unknown what you went through that too quickly.

264
00:21:38,844 --> 00:21:39,950
Speaker 0: You gotta like tell that one.

265
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:40,839
Speaker 1: Well, I gotta tell it slow.

266
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,131
Speaker 1: I got a good pendulum still All right.

267
00:21:42,152 --> 00:21:45,530
Speaker 0: Well, the other thing is we don't know if he was naked before he broke in or after.

268
00:21:46,374 --> 00:21:47,408
Speaker 1: You know, it's tough to say.

269
00:21:48,371 --> 00:21:51,141
Speaker 1: The actual story here is this guy comes home late at night.

270
00:21:51,181 --> 00:21:52,345
Speaker 1: He's 330 a.m.

271
00:21:52,626 --> 00:21:53,590
Speaker 1: His windows been broken.

272
00:21:54,152 --> 00:21:59,729
Speaker 1: So he goes into his house all suspicious like there's a naked black man laying there sound asleep on the couch.

273
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,539
Speaker 0: Well, it's a black man broke into a black man's house.

274
00:22:03,041 --> 00:22:03,262
Speaker 1: Yeah.

275
00:22:03,422 --> 00:22:06,699
Speaker 1: Yeah, and he's laying there except for he's got like a sheet Kind of over his genitals.

276
00:22:06,921 --> 00:22:09,999
Speaker 0: I think the The guy who owns the house put that there.

277
00:22:10,722 --> 00:22:11,204
Speaker 1: I don't know.

278
00:22:11,545 --> 00:22:15,450
Speaker 1: It's not entirely clear But I think I'll admit the guy who filmed this.

279
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:20,270
Speaker 1: I mean, it's probably not staged but I wouldn't wake the guy up with a camera.

280
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:21,858
Speaker 1: I would just wait for the police to show up.

281
00:22:22,219 --> 00:22:24,470
Speaker 0: Well, the police showed up like 10 seconds later.

282
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:28,158
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah But he films himself kind basically going.

283
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,142
Speaker 1: you got to see this.

284
00:22:29,523 --> 00:22:38,150
Speaker 1: and then he goes into his house and he films this guy Just naked in his sleep and then for whatever reason he decides to wake the guy up Well, he kicks him which is what I would have done first.

285
00:22:38,230 --> 00:22:46,665
Speaker 1: I would have kicked him squat in his naked ass nuts and the guy wakes up and is suitably indignant though suitably Dazed and confused at first.

286
00:22:46,927 --> 00:22:55,348
Speaker 0: Yeah The only thing I can like with the the guy who owns the house I can tell what he's saying mostly fuck you what the fuck you do to my house.

287
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:56,639
Speaker 1: best I can tell the.

288
00:22:56,699 --> 00:23:01,943
Speaker 0: the guy who broke in says No, the best I can tell is when the guy kicks him awake.

289
00:23:02,245 --> 00:23:04,545
Speaker 0: He's like you broke into my house guys Like how you know day?

290
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:07,416
Speaker 0: That's what I think he says.

291
00:23:07,959 --> 00:23:08,380
Speaker 0: it's up for.

292
00:23:08,461 --> 00:23:10,510
Speaker 0: it's up for debate there's there's nothing there.

293
00:23:10,811 --> 00:23:14,170
Speaker 1: This guy is about on the level of the guy who broke into that convenience store.

294
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:23,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, the funniest part of the video is after the guy, you know kicks the intruder enough that he's down on the ground The cops show up and the cop the cop just walks in.

295
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:25,609
Speaker 0: he's like what's going on here?

296
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,449
Speaker 0: The guy says look I broke in my house and he arrests him right there.

297
00:23:29,697 --> 00:23:31,738
Speaker 1: Yep and the great thing is the guy like he's kind of.

298
00:23:31,778 --> 00:23:39,950
Speaker 1: he beats the guy up a little bit starts kicking him the robber and The robber is looking at him with the look of I'm gonna take you down right when the cop walks in.

299
00:23:40,492 --> 00:23:42,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, and at least he doesn't fight the cop.

300
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:43,223
Speaker 0: He just liked it.

301
00:23:44,086 --> 00:23:44,869
Speaker 0: He just goes down.

302
00:23:47,131 --> 00:23:57,830
Speaker 1: It's pretty funny, I don't know if if I came home and there was a naked guy laying on the couch I would probably just call the police and wait outside and if he came to try to leave the house I hit him with a bat or something.

303
00:23:58,062 --> 00:24:00,922
Speaker 0: Yeah I would pretty much just stand there with a video camera watching him.

304
00:24:00,962 --> 00:24:02,710
Speaker 0: so I get a video of the police arresting him.

305
00:24:02,831 --> 00:24:03,595
Speaker 1: I just take a picture.

306
00:24:03,615 --> 00:24:04,882
Speaker 1: I never would have thought to video it.

307
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:06,210
Speaker 0: Well, it's because you don't have a camera?

308
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:08,884
Speaker 0: Yeah, we do not not a useful one.

309
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:09,890
Speaker 1: We have a camcorder.

310
00:24:10,571 --> 00:24:12,070
Speaker 1: Anyway, that camcorder cost over $3,000.

311
00:24:12,070 --> 00:24:15,893
Speaker 1: Yeah in 1986.

312
00:24:15,893 --> 00:24:18,690
Speaker 0: so I would definitely video it if I had the equipment.

313
00:24:19,351 --> 00:24:21,801
Speaker 0: But I wouldn't like wake him up before the cops got there.

314
00:24:21,922 --> 00:24:27,556
Speaker 0: if he did wake up before the cops got there I'd be just I would have a bat and I just go wham And he'd be on the.

315
00:24:27,797 --> 00:24:29,204
Speaker 0: I think is I wouldn't want to make a mess.

316
00:24:29,224 --> 00:24:33,382
Speaker 0: Like I try to hit him in the nuts I don't want like his head bleeding all over my carpet or any.

317
00:24:33,422 --> 00:24:35,550
Speaker 1: but you don't want nut all over your carpet either.

318
00:24:35,651 --> 00:24:36,476
Speaker 0: There won't be nut.

319
00:24:36,556 --> 00:24:40,810
Speaker 0: if you hit a guy in the nuts of the baseball pad I'll just send his nuts flying into his stomach.

320
00:24:40,910 --> 00:24:41,212
Speaker 0: You know what?

321
00:24:41,272 --> 00:24:47,367
Speaker 1: I would do I'd probably go into the closet where I got that old sword and I just stand there looking real Fucked up and menacing with it.

322
00:24:49,351 --> 00:24:52,509
Speaker 0: But yeah, you don't want to actually poke him low cuz they even more blood.

323
00:24:53,016 --> 00:24:53,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what?

324
00:24:54,550 --> 00:24:58,510
Speaker 0: The trick is there's a naked guy in your couch has already made a mess by being naked on your couch.

325
00:24:59,293 --> 00:25:02,085
Speaker 0: No, he's got his naked hobo slime on your couch.

326
00:25:02,105 --> 00:25:03,049
Speaker 1: the couch is forfeit.

327
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:08,550
Speaker 0: So you don't want to do any more damage by getting blood everywhere cuz it'll all stay in the couch.

328
00:25:10,192 --> 00:25:16,080
Speaker 0: You spear him with the sword into the couch like a pushpin But then the blood might leak onto the carpet under the couch.

329
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:16,883
Speaker 1: Not our couch.

330
00:25:17,445 --> 00:25:18,287
Speaker 1: Our couch is sturdy.

331
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:18,910
Speaker 1: It'll hold it in.

332
00:25:19,395 --> 00:25:20,146
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

333
00:25:20,771 --> 00:25:28,942
Speaker 0: Anyway, my thing it is is pretty short and I'm not gonna read the whole thing, even though I could easily Just get it, you know how to read.

334
00:25:28,962 --> 00:25:30,027
Speaker 0: yeah, I do know how to.

335
00:25:30,047 --> 00:25:30,750
Speaker 0: well, it's very short.

336
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:32,035
Speaker 0: It's like it wouldn't take too long.

337
00:25:32,055 --> 00:25:33,321
Speaker 0: I do know how to read.

338
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:33,602
Speaker 0: Yes.

339
00:25:34,506 --> 00:25:35,148
Speaker 0: I am literate.

340
00:25:35,993 --> 00:25:37,827
Speaker 0: Hooked on phonics works for me.

341
00:25:39,091 --> 00:25:40,858
Speaker 1: That was really lame.

342
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:41,299
Speaker 0: You suck.

343
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,547
Speaker 1: No one makes hooked on phonics jokes anymore.

344
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:44,029
Speaker 0: Now they do.

345
00:25:44,350 --> 00:25:45,875
Speaker 1: Yeah, 1996 called.

346
00:25:46,176 --> 00:25:48,924
Speaker 1: they want their joke back and you know what SNL called me.

347
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:50,709
Speaker 1: They want that joke back to me.

348
00:25:50,749 --> 00:25:56,529
Speaker 0: So This is a little webpage that describes the intelligent design sort.

349
00:25:56,630 --> 00:26:00,790
Speaker 0: now If you're not a programmer, you might not know what a sort is pretty much.

350
00:26:00,951 --> 00:26:04,430
Speaker 0: Let's say you have a bunch of stuff and you got to put it in order, right?

351
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:08,725
Speaker 0: So I've got the numbers one two and three and I've got them just sitting there.

352
00:26:08,745 --> 00:26:10,170
Speaker 0: I got to put them in order.

353
00:26:10,331 --> 00:26:14,406
Speaker 0: There are many different ways to program to write a program that does that.

354
00:26:14,687 --> 00:26:15,590
Speaker 0: there's a bubble sort.

355
00:26:15,751 --> 00:26:17,357
Speaker 1: That was the first one I was gonna say.

356
00:26:17,377 --> 00:26:18,883
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a quick sort.

357
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:23,708
Speaker 0: There's all sorts of different sorts And all sorts of sorts.

358
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:43,050
Speaker 0: Yes the intelligent design sort is obviously not an actual sort but a bit of comedy that combines the quote theory of intelligent design with the Principle of a sorting algorithm and it is quite hilarious.

359
00:26:43,452 --> 00:26:44,335
Speaker 1: Fairly, well done.

360
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:44,958
Speaker 1: Good show.

361
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:45,500
Speaker 0: Good show.

362
00:26:45,921 --> 00:26:48,070
Speaker 0: So here's your thing of the day, right?

363
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:52,910
Speaker 1: So being lazy as we tend to be on Mondays, we were gonna talk about, you know codex and all that.

364
00:26:52,950 --> 00:27:09,410
Speaker 1: We've said we're gonna talk about that before video on to internet and we realized not to sound like crotches old men that many Of you out there are spoiled young kids with the YouTube and your Google video Who have no idea the trouble that people used to have to go through to see any sort of moving content on to internet?

365
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:14,547
Speaker 0: So hopefully I mean when YouTube finally existed and finally worked properly.

366
00:27:14,568 --> 00:27:15,994
Speaker 0: It was like Whoa.

367
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,855
Speaker 0: Finally it is here.

368
00:27:18,875 --> 00:27:24,070
Speaker 0: You have no you can't understand what we went through before we had this modern technology.

369
00:27:24,715 --> 00:27:31,610
Speaker 0: This is ten years of anticipation So hopefully this will give you some appreciation of those who came before.

370
00:27:32,051 --> 00:27:38,710
Speaker 1: See we grew up when the internet was the wild wild west where most people wait even before the internet.

371
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:39,449
Speaker 0: Let's talk about the video.

372
00:27:39,510 --> 00:27:44,830
Speaker 1: Well, I was gonna say there the internet was around but most people who had internet didn't actually have internet.

373
00:27:45,072 --> 00:27:58,490
Speaker 1: they had like prodigy or something and Seeing a moving thing on the internet in a website was this unfathomable Dream, but seeing a video on your computer was already unfathomable.

374
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:09,110
Speaker 0: I mean people would have something on their computer like Microsoft and Carta or some sort of other CD based Encyclopedia and there might be some short video clips on there.

375
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:16,501
Speaker 0: But they were like two seconds long and the resolution was crap like in those days I remember watching like a short clip from Star Wars and in Carta.

376
00:28:16,802 --> 00:28:27,430
Speaker 0: I had a multimedia like a Pentium one and go Yeah, but my for guys saw that if you saw it now you you probably be like you can't even tell it Star Wars.

377
00:28:27,812 --> 00:28:29,850
Speaker 0: It was that shitty my 486.

378
00:28:29,850 --> 00:28:38,316
Speaker 1: I got one of those encyclopedias with it and it had these like 15 second clips and the resolution was like 50 by 50 Something like that.

379
00:28:38,357 --> 00:28:51,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I would sit there for hours Pouring over the the WAV files and the MIDI files and the Movie files that were 50 by 50 just in utter shock.

380
00:28:51,606 --> 00:28:52,389
Speaker 1: Ah and wonderment.

381
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:59,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean we had much better videos to watch on our VHS tapes, but somehow when it was on the computer It was amazing.

382
00:28:59,357 --> 00:29:00,023
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

383
00:29:00,044 --> 00:29:00,669
Speaker 1: you know what it is.

384
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:06,398
Speaker 1: It's kind of like back in the day when if a video game talked to you in English You just wet your pants.

385
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:10,410
Speaker 0: I guess yeah, but you know, yeah Talks to you in English all the time.

386
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:17,595
Speaker 1: Yeah But like the first time I played TIE fighter and x-wing and the people talked to me I freaked out and I'm like dad look at this.

387
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:17,916
Speaker 1: Look at this.

388
00:29:17,936 --> 00:29:18,197
Speaker 1: Look at this.

389
00:29:18,497 --> 00:29:22,139
Speaker 1: Darth Vader just said something Holy crap, and I didn't know what to do.

390
00:29:22,822 --> 00:29:24,348
Speaker 0: and obviously, you know what he said?

391
00:29:25,753 --> 00:29:37,770
Speaker 1: I'll say I'll put it this way my parents where This is the diplomatic mission My dad was Understandably unimpressed.

392
00:29:38,512 --> 00:29:44,010
Speaker 1: I don't think that anyone other than me and my friends my age and my little brother was impressed by this.

393
00:29:44,474 --> 00:29:45,990
Speaker 1: No, I don't know what it was.

394
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:49,481
Speaker 1: It's just seeing like watching a crappy video on the computer.

395
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:56,863
Speaker 1: was this magical thing, but watching a tape was just old head Yeah, and in those days the videos were a VI or MOV.

396
00:29:56,903 --> 00:29:59,270
Speaker 0: It was pretty much QuickTime and Windows Media Player.

397
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:06,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean MPEG video was around pretty early But no one could play them.

398
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,742
Speaker 1: you couldn't just play it in a computer.

399
00:30:07,843 --> 00:30:10,250
Speaker 1: computers didn't have media playing things.

400
00:30:11,037 --> 00:30:15,070
Speaker 1: You had to get a special MPEG player and most of them cost money.

401
00:30:15,170 --> 00:30:22,176
Speaker 0: It was it was a chip on a card and you stuck it in your computer and ran a wire from the card To your video card.

402
00:30:22,476 --> 00:30:26,489
Speaker 0: and then that that was actually way beyond the days of just plain old a VI.

403
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:27,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was.

404
00:30:27,936 --> 00:30:30,690
Speaker 0: it was that I was like the first thing after a VI came around.

405
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:32,997
Speaker 1: It was the same thing when DVD came around.

406
00:30:33,017 --> 00:30:39,580
Speaker 1: well early computers couldn't decode MPEG - you had to have a DVD decoder card in your computer.

407
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:41,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I mean the way it works is.

408
00:30:43,012 --> 00:30:46,190
Speaker 0: We had a VI and a VI was uncompressed.

409
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:52,670
Speaker 0: But you know, they might have just made compressed the you know, the video to make it shittier and lower quality.

410
00:30:53,152 --> 00:30:57,650
Speaker 0: But the video it file itself required less processor to play.

411
00:30:57,690 --> 00:31:06,950
Speaker 0: I mean it was basically reading JPEGs or bitmaps and just displaying them quickly one after the other, you know And these files are big and you couldn't really do much with them.

412
00:31:07,272 --> 00:31:09,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you would die like if you wanted to get a video.

413
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:19,219
Speaker 1: I remember I downloaded a five second clip from Les Miserables and it took like an hour and it was super Awesome by super awesome.

414
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,050
Speaker 1: I mean it was tiny and shitty and skipped.

415
00:31:21,391 --> 00:31:30,565
Speaker 0: Yep, but if you wanted to play an MPEG, which is actually a compressed video file That means not only did you have your CPU have to play the video file.

416
00:31:30,866 --> 00:31:34,537
Speaker 0: It also had to Decompress the video file simultaneously.

417
00:31:34,597 --> 00:31:39,030
Speaker 0: That was a lot of work and the processors of the day were not capable of doing it.

418
00:31:39,391 --> 00:31:44,270
Speaker 0: I mean you think about what you have today with like the MPEG 4s and the divixes and the xvids.

419
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:57,770
Speaker 0: if you try to play an x-vid on like a Pentium 3 the thing will be like Because it doesn't have enough power to Decode the x-vid into playable video as fast as it's supposed to be played.

420
00:31:57,830 --> 00:32:03,770
Speaker 0: I mean it decodes one frame of the videos slower than the speed at which you need to watch one frame.

421
00:32:04,292 --> 00:32:13,310
Speaker 1: I mean pretty much video on computers was confined to animation from a game or CD content that was low quality and crap.

422
00:32:13,691 --> 00:32:15,417
Speaker 1: I mean, we're not talking about streaming.

423
00:32:15,718 --> 00:32:28,975
Speaker 0: the mere idea of streaming video was ludicrous like Inconceivable and impossible because the fastest modem you could have was like a 14 4 or 28 8 and that was way Crazy by those times.

424
00:32:28,995 --> 00:32:33,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember by 28 8 56 K was even crazier and that didn't come for years.

425
00:32:33,991 --> 00:32:38,771
Speaker 1: I mean I had a 2400 baud modem and then we upgraded and I got a 336.

426
00:32:38,771 --> 00:32:40,277
Speaker 0: there was at least a year where 33 6 was it?

427
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:40,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was it.

428
00:32:43,691 --> 00:32:50,840
Speaker 0: And even when 56 K's came out they were like not every place supported 56 K. So it was like thirty three six slash 56 K.

429
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,130
Speaker 1: Yeah the first real revolution.

430
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,551
Speaker 1: I mean.

431
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:56,280
Speaker 1: actually I did download an AVI.

432
00:32:56,320 --> 00:32:57,584
Speaker 1: I still have it to this day.

433
00:32:57,845 --> 00:33:00,878
Speaker 1: It's the first large video I ever downloaded from the internet.

434
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:06,565
Speaker 1: It's in the same directory as the first mp3 I ever downloaded or played other than Winnie.

435
00:33:06,625 --> 00:33:06,967
Speaker 1: Winnie.

436
00:33:07,047 --> 00:33:10,017
Speaker 0: Winnie It really whips the llama's ass.

437
00:33:10,037 --> 00:33:11,802
Speaker 0: Yeah now there were a lot of.

438
00:33:11,983 --> 00:33:14,229
Speaker 0: you could get a video sometimes on a CD romp.

439
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:16,669
Speaker 0: That was pretty much the best way to get a video.

440
00:33:17,232 --> 00:33:21,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, because it was faster than downloading anything is you just got six hundred and forty megabytes, right?

441
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:22,836
Speaker 1: Except there weren't.

442
00:33:23,038 --> 00:33:24,410
Speaker 1: no one was making videos.

443
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:28,750
Speaker 1: So the only videos you get were things in like the Encarta encyclopedia that your parents bought you.

444
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:33,310
Speaker 0: Well, for example, we had a game that came with our PC was undersea adventure.

445
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:35,749
Speaker 0: It was just a little educational aquarium game.

446
00:33:36,151 --> 00:33:52,290
Speaker 0: But there were all these little videos with Jacques Cousteau and he would say stuff I remember pouring through like FMV's and video games AVI files on CD roms and they were all short and low quality and amazing somehow.

447
00:33:52,831 --> 00:34:05,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember when I had xcom mission UFO and I pulled the AVI file out of it and I made it action God a macromedia action presentation and I put the video in it and I thought I was so cool.

448
00:34:07,062 --> 00:34:10,695
Speaker 0: Mmm, yeah Monty Python in the.

449
00:34:10,896 --> 00:34:18,588
Speaker 0: oh, yeah the Monty Python games had the Monty Python game for Windows 3.1 and I had a lot of 100 by 100 pixel.

450
00:34:18,668 --> 00:34:25,080
Speaker 0: it had a lot of incredibly low resolution skit videos That were all cut short and they were all on the CD ROM.

451
00:34:25,219 --> 00:34:38,139
Speaker 0: So whenever you're gonna watch one you had to wait for it to read the CD ROM and then play it and then oh man Those are the days so fast forward to the middle of 56k era and the beginning For many people of the cable modem era.

452
00:34:38,841 --> 00:34:40,679
Speaker 1: DSL was kind of a pipe dream back then.

453
00:34:41,342 --> 00:34:42,206
Speaker 1: I mean your options were.

454
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:47,079
Speaker 1: really if you lived in one of the places where they were testing cable modems You could get a cable modem.

455
00:34:47,681 --> 00:34:57,040
Speaker 1: I was actually very lucky and that one of the first cable modem deployments was in the area where I lived and I had a Cable doesn't seem to understand like his time when the cable modems are coming in.

456
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:59,675
Speaker 0: It was actually when most everyone had 56k modems.

457
00:34:59,696 --> 00:35:11,610
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean I got me and my friends in high school and like early high school we're at the point where we were playing games with low pings and We couldn't fathom people having a ping higher than like a hundred.

458
00:35:11,730 --> 00:35:20,805
Speaker 0: cable modems weren't widely available in most areas like 2000 even like yeah 99 2000.

459
00:35:20,805 --> 00:35:21,888
Speaker 1: They were expensive.

460
00:35:22,369 --> 00:35:23,833
Speaker 0: they were really expensive, you know.

461
00:35:23,893 --> 00:35:26,240
Speaker 0: and DSL it was sort of like depending on where you lived.

462
00:35:26,321 --> 00:35:35,851
Speaker 0: It was either the DSL or cable, you know If you lived really close to the phone company DSL was coming in if you live if you have her in a place where your Cable company was really good.

463
00:35:35,872 --> 00:35:37,240
Speaker 0: You got lots of cable.

464
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:46,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, cable modems kind of bridged the gap because before then the really cool uber people had isdn lines Still a hajillion down.

465
00:35:47,085 --> 00:35:47,172
Speaker 1: Yeah.

466
00:35:47,481 --> 00:35:54,422
Speaker 1: so then cable modems started appearing and early on the reason cable modems were so awesome is they didn't really pay attention to the Bandwidth.

467
00:35:54,462 --> 00:35:55,287
Speaker 1: you used it all.

468
00:35:55,709 --> 00:35:57,660
Speaker 1: it was free and open and fair game.

469
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:01,820
Speaker 1: Whatever you could get you could get and most people didn't even have computers where I lived.

470
00:36:02,281 --> 00:36:09,460
Speaker 0: So it's not like they expected anyone to have more than one computer or a computer powerful enough to use lots of bandwidth.

471
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:16,707
Speaker 1: I also don't think they expected me and my friends and all the other geeks in the area to Saturate that cable modem network immediately.

472
00:36:17,088 --> 00:36:18,612
Speaker 0: Yeah go napster.

473
00:36:18,993 --> 00:36:28,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, but right around that time Real media appeared and they put forth something called real media appeared like in Way earlier.

474
00:36:29,446 --> 00:36:30,932
Speaker 1: That's when I had a cable modem.

475
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:31,674
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

476
00:36:31,815 --> 00:36:32,076
Speaker 0: All right.

477
00:36:32,116 --> 00:36:35,247
Speaker 0: Yeah, they appeared I think when I still had a 14-4 modem.

478
00:36:35,408 --> 00:36:37,074
Speaker 1: there were most of high school.

479
00:36:37,094 --> 00:36:37,957
Speaker 1: I had a cable modem.

480
00:36:37,977 --> 00:36:45,968
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, yeah until it went to shit when we were seniors because then everyone got a cable modem and it was still unrestricted bandwidth access.

481
00:36:46,374 --> 00:36:50,173
Speaker 1: so pings Skyrocketed and throughput fell apart and everything went to shit.

482
00:36:50,635 --> 00:36:51,217
Speaker 1: and then I moved.

483
00:36:51,237 --> 00:36:51,900
Speaker 1: I didn't care anymore.

484
00:36:53,081 --> 00:37:09,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, but no right around that time when I had a cable modem not that it mattered for this Real media appeared and a lot of old-timers will still call any kind of real file a real audio file a real audio player Because that's all they made back then Real audio.

485
00:37:09,084 --> 00:37:20,400
Speaker 1: It was a big horrible bloated application and it would stream an Incredibly low quality audio to your computer live semi live.

486
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,834
Speaker 1: It buffered for like a minute and they would play a minute and ten second clip.

487
00:37:24,276 --> 00:37:24,617
Speaker 0: I got it.

488
00:37:24,677 --> 00:37:27,506
Speaker 0: I got it All right, apparently I looked it up just now.

489
00:37:28,047 --> 00:37:42,184
Speaker 0: the first version of real player came out in 95 and it was real audio player which I remember that because what it could do is you would go and get internet radio and it would take audio and Compress it horrendously.

490
00:37:42,264 --> 00:37:51,089
Speaker 0: It would basically sound like mostly static and but you could listen to live or semi live Streaming audio on your computer.

491
00:37:51,149 --> 00:37:51,290
Speaker 1: Yep.

492
00:37:51,330 --> 00:37:53,096
Speaker 1: Now then I didn't even have a cable modem yet.

493
00:37:53,116 --> 00:37:53,578
Speaker 1: That was the 33-6 mode.

494
00:37:54,542 --> 00:38:01,155
Speaker 0: I didn't use that thing until like God 97 it must have been when I tried to do that.

495
00:38:01,417 --> 00:38:08,948
Speaker 1: see I Remember a lot of websites appear that had a bunch of real audio clips that were cool and I used to the ones I always looked at.

496
00:38:08,968 --> 00:38:10,192
Speaker 1: a lot were stuff about musicals.

497
00:38:10,232 --> 00:38:14,149
Speaker 1: there be clips from musicals and They would be terrible and shitty.

498
00:38:14,169 --> 00:38:23,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean remember there were no mp3s Yeah, and then there was the other player which eventually they came out with real player, which is just real player.

499
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:26,007
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could do video and yeah do.

500
00:38:26,268 --> 00:38:30,040
Speaker 0: then it was like real player g2 which worked better with Intel processors.

501
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:33,750
Speaker 1: Remember that yeah, and there were all sorts of basically real.

502
00:38:33,850 --> 00:38:38,824
Speaker 1: the company was a collection of idiots and assholes Pretty much from the start.

503
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:41,451
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were real jukebox.

504
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:43,195
Speaker 1: They were universally reviled.

505
00:38:43,215 --> 00:38:49,473
Speaker 1: They were one of the earliest, you know Companies with really bad bloatware spyware and all that sort of stuff.

506
00:38:49,574 --> 00:38:55,259
Speaker 0: They cleaned up their egg mostly lately Yeah, and but now they've sort of no longer have a use for them.

507
00:38:55,501 --> 00:38:58,500
Speaker 1: No, really, they're no worse than any other company out there nowadays.

508
00:38:58,641 --> 00:39:05,730
Speaker 1: They don't really deserve any particular hatred or anything not anymore people our age Remember what they were and can't forgive them.

509
00:39:06,031 --> 00:39:08,279
Speaker 0: No, they pretty much started a lot of this stuff.

510
00:39:08,601 --> 00:39:12,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they were one of the first applications that would have the checkbox.

511
00:39:12,401 --> 00:39:14,272
Speaker 1: Like would you like to receive email from us?

512
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:15,640
Speaker 1: Would you like to subscribe to blah?

513
00:39:15,921 --> 00:39:19,155
Speaker 1: Would you like to install the special handy super duper toolbar?

514
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:24,040
Speaker 1: and the thing is It would show a list of all the things you can install they'd all be unchecked.

515
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:34,146
Speaker 1: So you'd click OK, but the list had a scroll bar and if you scroll down you'd see that there were like 40 options under the five at the top that weren't checked and all the Ones underneath it you couldn't see were checked.

516
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:36,654
Speaker 0: Yeah, I default when I'm making that up.

517
00:39:37,035 --> 00:39:37,998
Speaker 0: That's absolutely true.

518
00:39:38,139 --> 00:39:41,238
Speaker 1: It was Those those people I I hated them.

519
00:39:41,842 --> 00:39:46,720
Speaker 1: So and I remember the CEO of real would always say horrible things.

520
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:49,288
Speaker 1: He wasn't one of the earliest proponents of DRM.

521
00:39:49,529 --> 00:39:49,709
Speaker 1: Yeah.

522
00:39:50,271 --> 00:40:08,014
Speaker 0: Anyway, like the thing about real was back in the day They actually had an innovative and important technology and that when you had low bandwidth and a shitty processor Real audio and real video made it possible to watch or listen to audio and video streaming from the internet.

523
00:40:08,475 --> 00:40:22,340
Speaker 0: in My 14-4 modem I could watch CNN news in like this tiny little window And it was minutes upon minutes of video that I could watch any just by clicking on it.

524
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:31,260
Speaker 0: And it was crazy and like you would update all the time Like I could open up real player and watch the news like it updated five times a day and that was insane

525
00:40:31,802 --> 00:40:41,180
Speaker 1: Yep, and then there was the point at which MPEG video started getting you know Computers are fast enough and there were ways to play it for free and you didn't need hardware anymore.

526
00:40:41,802 --> 00:40:50,276
Speaker 1: And then a lot of sites hosting anime music videos or hosting, you know Just various videos of not really not a lot of pirated stuff.

527
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:55,739
Speaker 1: for a long time It was mostly fan created stuff and cool stuff people had filmed and like news.

528
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,285
Speaker 0: Well, that was even way later.

529
00:40:57,385 --> 00:41:03,063
Speaker 0: Actually the thing that happened after real player is if you started to use Napster.

530
00:41:03,263 --> 00:41:09,180
Speaker 0: Napster mostly did mp3s, but the open nap protocol that came around in like the wake of Napster.

531
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:14,592
Speaker 0: I don't know enough about it But it's basically people were able to run servers that did the same thing.

532
00:41:14,632 --> 00:41:19,268
Speaker 1: that really kind of peaked and then died Like during our freshman year of college.

533
00:41:19,288 --> 00:41:20,312
Speaker 0: it did.

534
00:41:20,412 --> 00:41:22,460
Speaker 0: Well, no, it was actually around for a long time.

535
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:36,616
Speaker 0: We just didn't get into it until in college, but a lot of people were using Napster like things like around the year 2099 2001, you know in the in the peak of Napster to trade videos.

536
00:41:36,696 --> 00:41:41,660
Speaker 1: also see in those days I that stuff all that old peer-to-peer thing wasn't quite flesh out yet.

537
00:41:42,162 --> 00:41:45,594
Speaker 1: And I even remember when Napster came out I laughed at all my friends like why would you use that?

538
00:41:45,875 --> 00:41:46,858
Speaker 1: just go to the mp3?

539
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:49,164
Speaker 0: Sites exactly.

540
00:41:49,184 --> 00:41:56,213
Speaker 0: It's like so many people were just using the regular Napster to do mp3s But there were a lot of savvy people who would get what.

541
00:41:56,233 --> 00:41:57,037
Speaker 0: was that program?

542
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:57,780
Speaker 0: something Gator?

543
00:41:58,520 --> 00:41:59,785
Speaker 0: Not not the bad Gator.

544
00:41:59,825 --> 00:42:02,835
Speaker 0: the spyware one a different one and you could like it.

545
00:42:03,076 --> 00:42:04,119
Speaker 0: was it nap Gator?

546
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:04,360
Speaker 0: nap?

547
00:42:04,744 --> 00:42:05,188
Speaker 1: I don't know.

548
00:42:05,249 --> 00:42:06,280
Speaker 1: You see I didn't do any of that.

549
00:42:06,723 --> 00:42:09,420
Speaker 1: I had a bunch of websites I went to that had regular.

550
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:20,870
Speaker 1: I mean, you know There's wares community today and the wares community back then which was actually a long time ago used to be very different Though in a lot of ways is still very much the same.

551
00:42:21,412 --> 00:42:29,080
Speaker 1: just different punk kids different punk kid ideals Yeah, but the people who were in the know or the people who were lucky I was one of the lucky ones.

552
00:42:29,201 --> 00:42:39,860
Speaker 1: I didn't actually know any of these people but I ended up with the passwords to a whole bunch of FTP sites that had all sorts of wares and all sorts of like anime videos and all sorts of just fun stuff in there.

553
00:42:40,261 --> 00:42:41,928
Speaker 1: So I never saw the reason for peer-to-peer.

554
00:42:42,209 --> 00:42:44,800
Speaker 1: Why would I waste my precious upstream bandwidth helping people?

555
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:49,570
Speaker 0: Anyway, the next thing to happen was pretty much mpeg-4 and divics.

556
00:42:49,711 --> 00:42:53,844
Speaker 0: That was like the smash that is created the environment We have today.

557
00:42:53,984 --> 00:42:57,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, that was the Industrial Revolution of video on the internet.

558
00:42:57,501 --> 00:43:03,480
Speaker 0: Basically what happened is they came up with this mpeg-4 which was hey we can compress the video a lot.

559
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:06,632
Speaker 0: Still have it look good with our fancy algorithms.

560
00:43:06,993 --> 00:43:17,965
Speaker 0: You need a better CPU and if you download about 200 megabytes of video you can get like a half hour of Really good looking shit.

561
00:43:18,406 --> 00:43:19,872
Speaker 1: And of course the rest was history.

562
00:43:19,892 --> 00:43:21,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know we kill.

563
00:43:21,939 --> 00:43:25,440
Speaker 1: honestly There's been a lot of trend until YouTube and Google video.

564
00:43:25,862 --> 00:43:29,380
Speaker 1: The trend was away from streaming stuff because people would rather just download it.

565
00:43:29,722 --> 00:43:32,018
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you could get really high quality stuff.

566
00:43:32,782 --> 00:43:34,792
Speaker 0: All you had to do was download it with.

567
00:43:34,832 --> 00:43:40,920
Speaker 0: you know, your favorite peer-to-peer thing Which you know, there were a lot of them over time and the codex kept improving.

568
00:43:40,940 --> 00:43:44,838
Speaker 0: you kept getting better and better looking video with less and less download time.

569
00:43:44,859 --> 00:43:44,919
Speaker 0: and

570
00:43:46,401 --> 00:44:02,592
Speaker 1: Yeah, and streaming really just came back with YouTube and Google video Which the two single-handedly brought back the idea of that streaming video Could be popular and good and also the fact that bandwidth increased to the point to where it was feasible for the majority of cool People to be able to do it.

571
00:44:03,198 --> 00:44:04,725
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean flash vid.

572
00:44:04,805 --> 00:44:09,240
Speaker 0: it's kind of weird though because people are getting higher and higher quality stuff in less and less space.

573
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:14,720
Speaker 0: Right flat YouTube and flash video is basically like yeah, we don't care what it looks like anymore.

574
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:18,739
Speaker 0: We spent all that effort making these awesome codex and honing these algorithms.

575
00:44:18,779 --> 00:44:20,645
Speaker 0: now Toss them out the window.

576
00:44:20,665 --> 00:44:20,906
Speaker 0: who needs?

577
00:44:21,047 --> 00:44:23,679
Speaker 1: because YouTube and Google video are like watching something on TV.

578
00:44:24,163 --> 00:44:25,271
Speaker 1: You do it for the content.

579
00:44:25,653 --> 00:44:29,031
Speaker 1: if you want the quality You go to wherever you go to get that sort of thing.

580
00:44:29,071 --> 00:44:35,800
Speaker 1: and get that sort of thing and burn it to a CD And put it in your stack of a thousand fan subs that you're never gonna watch, but you can say you own.

581
00:44:36,465 --> 00:44:38,922
Speaker 0: Yeah It's good to see that You know.

582
00:44:38,942 --> 00:44:51,960
Speaker 0: like while that a lot of fan subs do end up on YouTube and some people watch them there maybe because it's easier for them there's still the Large community and very popular group of people who you know, they want to watch a whole show.

583
00:44:52,100 --> 00:44:56,640
Speaker 0: They're not gonna freakin watch it on YouTube in three or four parts of five minutes each.

584
00:44:56,921 --> 00:44:59,673
Speaker 1: You'd be surprised how many young and there are a lot of.

585
00:44:59,693 --> 00:45:08,888
Speaker 0: there are a lot of people who do that But there is still plenty of people who go and they use the bit Torrance and they download their favorite show in HD or whatever.

586
00:45:09,048 --> 00:45:09,370
Speaker 0: Yeah.

587
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:14,610
Speaker 0: Yeah HD anime HD Anime or you know much higher resolution.

588
00:45:14,630 --> 00:45:19,068
Speaker 0: It only doesn't take up that much space, you know it doesn't take too long to download.

589
00:45:19,108 --> 00:45:24,839
Speaker 0: on bit Torrance if you're watching something popular and Goddamn, is it good to have that compared to what?

590
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:30,276
Speaker 0: Avi's on a CD that are 50 by 50 and yeah 30 seconds long.

591
00:45:30,316 --> 00:45:31,079
Speaker 1: go to an FTP site.

592
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:35,440
Speaker 1: We have to upload 500 megabytes before you're allowed to download 10 megabytes.

593
00:45:35,841 --> 00:45:39,633
Speaker 1: So I uploaded 500 megabytes of garbage from a looping garbage file.

594
00:45:39,673 --> 00:45:41,178
Speaker 0: I made think about that.

595
00:45:41,198 --> 00:45:42,949
Speaker 0: think about that Back in the day.

596
00:45:43,332 --> 00:45:46,667
Speaker 0: you had to have a CD Right and you could fit on it.

597
00:45:46,767 --> 00:45:50,859
Speaker 0: Maybe a few minutes of incredibly low-resolution crap video.

598
00:45:51,523 --> 00:46:01,900
Speaker 0: Nowadays, I can fit like three or four Very good-looking episodes of an anime or any other TV show on a CD that just blow your mind.

599
00:46:02,381 --> 00:46:06,333
Speaker 0: The difference was the CPU and not the storage space.

600
00:46:06,473 --> 00:46:07,737
Speaker 0: Well, this is a CD.

601
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:08,700
Speaker 0: now is a CD then?

602
00:46:09,061 --> 00:46:17,180
Speaker 1: Yep, because they could have had those algorithms then too But you'd look at them and no computer of the time could possibly decode that in any reasonable fashion.

603
00:46:17,221 --> 00:46:24,660
Speaker 0: Yeah You would have to basically leave your computer running overnight and then maybe like a few more like days days later.

604
00:46:24,961 --> 00:46:29,260
Speaker 0: It would play it, you know, you couldn't do it at the same time decoding and watching.

605
00:46:29,824 --> 00:46:31,636
Speaker 0: That's how fast your computers are.

606
00:46:31,696 --> 00:46:32,260
Speaker 0: It's insane.

607
00:46:32,893 --> 00:46:36,945
Speaker 1: But yeah I guess hopefully we offered a little bit of perspective and Sometime in the future.

608
00:46:36,986 --> 00:46:40,799
Speaker 1: We'll probably end this series by talking about the current state of it.

609
00:46:41,141 --> 00:46:44,999
Speaker 1: You know the codex that are popular now how to get them all that stuff.
