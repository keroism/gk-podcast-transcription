1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,388
Speaker 0: It's Monday March 19th.

2
00:00:11,709 --> 00:00:12,191
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:14,358
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights.

4
00:00:14,659 --> 00:00:21,040
Speaker 0: tonight We explain version control systems such as CVS and subversion in simple layman's non-technical terms.

5
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:28,226
Speaker 0: Let's do this So Friday night.

6
00:00:29,052 --> 00:00:30,095
Speaker 0: Well actually Friday evening.

7
00:00:30,136 --> 00:00:33,790
Speaker 0: I was trying to leave work, and I noticed that a little bit of snow a little bit.

8
00:00:34,251 --> 00:00:40,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was in the city and there was some snow coming down, but it didn't look like anything that was gonna disturb my day.

9
00:00:40,471 --> 00:00:42,450
Speaker 1: You know it all melted as soon as hit the ground.

10
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:44,739
Speaker 1: Not really any trouble.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:49,769
Speaker 0: so as soon as I get to my car it turns into a blizzard And I basically had to drive home in a blizzard.

12
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:55,409
Speaker 0: now I learned something interesting the taconic which is this road that for anyone who lives in New York you know about the taconic.

13
00:00:55,911 --> 00:01:02,140
Speaker 0: Basically it was ground to a halt due to the fact that I don't know there were a million Accidents on it because everyone's stupid and it was snowing.

14
00:01:02,943 --> 00:01:08,182
Speaker 1: it seems like every time it snows That people forgot how to drive and snow the last time.

15
00:01:08,343 --> 00:01:08,865
Speaker 1: it's not like.

16
00:01:08,945 --> 00:01:11,798
Speaker 1: I go and I see this accident And there's some Florida plates there.

17
00:01:11,898 --> 00:01:16,529
Speaker 1: It's not like a going to see this accident, and it's teenagers It's middle-aged people from New York?

18
00:01:17,132 --> 00:01:20,750
Speaker 1: Did they not drive in snow last winter or a few weeks ago?

19
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:25,390
Speaker 0: It seems like what most people react in one of two ways to there being snow on the ground.

20
00:01:25,753 --> 00:01:34,969
Speaker 0: They either drive as fast as they always drive Which is already too fast in most cases and end up crashing or they go one mile an hour and don't let me pass.

21
00:01:35,951 --> 00:01:48,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, though Growing up in Michigan has a lot of benefits also having a car that Doesn't really look it, but it's actually pretty high off the ground and has a pretty good suspension in terms of dealing with snow.

22
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,090
Speaker 0: So I decided to take the back roads.

23
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:55,990
Speaker 0: I drove off through the mountains to get home on this little road that kind of hugs the Hudson River.

24
00:01:56,552 --> 00:01:57,898
Speaker 0: There was maybe one other car on.

25
00:01:57,918 --> 00:02:00,228
Speaker 0: this whole road wasn't plowed, but you know what.

26
00:02:00,409 --> 00:02:04,154
Speaker 0: I got home Just fine because there wasn't anyone in my way Mm-hmm.

27
00:02:04,817 --> 00:02:12,836
Speaker 1: yeah, I was on the train of course on the way home And I didn't really look out the window cuz I was minding some business while I was on the train And I got off the train.

28
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:16,550
Speaker 1: it was a lot more snow and beacon than there was in New York City.

29
00:02:17,071 --> 00:02:23,110
Speaker 0: Now I submit to you that the beacon train station is kind of low and all of the roads out of it go uphill.

30
00:02:23,654 --> 00:02:26,090
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it's the train station is on the Hudson River.

31
00:02:26,271 --> 00:02:33,146
Speaker 1: Yeah, if the town was lower than the river that would be trouble I imagine you know with flooding and such.

32
00:02:33,548 --> 00:02:35,798
Speaker 1: so yes The it basically from the river.

33
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:48,107
Speaker 1: then there's the train station at the same level as the river and then it only goes uphill from there pretty steeply in fact and Basically they didn't plow the parking lot and they were considering that it was still snowing heavily.

34
00:02:48,167 --> 00:02:54,830
Speaker 1: there really was many I and it had already snowed a lot though And they didn't plow the roads going out of the train station.

35
00:02:55,392 --> 00:03:03,361
Speaker 1: So like me and my car along with I'd say five or six other cars We're unable to make it out of the train station.

36
00:03:03,381 --> 00:03:03,562
Speaker 1: Well.

37
00:03:04,084 --> 00:03:05,670
Speaker 1: I did make it out of the train station.

38
00:03:06,293 --> 00:03:13,021
Speaker 1: I didn't make it up the hill like I made it about halfway up the hill And then the incline at that point was just like the limit.

39
00:03:13,503 --> 00:03:13,623
Speaker 0: now.

40
00:03:13,704 --> 00:03:15,510
Speaker 1: Here's the point which I couldn't go up.

41
00:03:15,711 --> 00:03:19,070
Speaker 0: Here's the point at which I want to jump in because I know which road that is that road goes.

42
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:26,229
Speaker 0: You know you can turn right and it seems to go off nowhere You can turn left, and it goes up to Main Street in 90 and all that you could have turned right.

43
00:03:26,309 --> 00:03:29,287
Speaker 1: no Yeah, I'm smarter than that.

44
00:03:29,408 --> 00:03:35,075
Speaker 1: all right I was thinking cuz you know there's a long line of people going left And I thought I'm gonna go right.

45
00:03:35,215 --> 00:03:46,068
Speaker 1: because yeah when I got up to that part where you choose between going left and right There was a little accident over to the right and some emergency vehicles, and they weren't letting anyone go that way.

46
00:03:46,088 --> 00:03:51,610
Speaker 1: Wow All right, and then so I go left, and I'm in this long line of cars going left.

47
00:03:51,771 --> 00:03:55,230
Speaker 1: I probably could have made it up that hill if I was all alone.

48
00:03:55,611 --> 00:04:01,060
Speaker 1: You know just I had just like I got some speed when the incline wasn't there And then I rolled up the rest of the hill.

49
00:04:01,221 --> 00:04:07,810
Speaker 1: you know with my existing speed I could have done that But you know it was a long line of cars basically creep creep creep creep.

50
00:04:08,292 --> 00:04:15,390
Speaker 1: And if I stopped and tried to like leave a space in front of me No all the cars would come and pass me on the left and go over the WL line that no one could see.

51
00:04:15,752 --> 00:04:17,743
Speaker 0: Hate to say it that but that probably would have been me.

52
00:04:17,983 --> 00:04:18,909
Speaker 0: it seems like cuz I've seen.

53
00:04:18,928 --> 00:04:20,380
Speaker 0: oh Yeah, it seems like Mazda 3s.

54
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,266
Speaker 0: Just don't handle snow.

55
00:04:21,286 --> 00:04:22,674
Speaker 1: very well I think it's cuz.

56
00:04:22,694 --> 00:04:24,441
Speaker 1: my tires are shot from driving in the middle of.

57
00:04:24,461 --> 00:04:25,827
Speaker 0: no tires aren't that bad.

58
00:04:25,867 --> 00:04:26,530
Speaker 1: They're pretty bad.

59
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:27,497
Speaker 0: I took a look at it.

60
00:04:27,518 --> 00:04:29,050
Speaker 1: You know how to tell if tires are bad.

61
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,694
Speaker 0: Yeah There's little wear indicators.

62
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:36,437
Speaker 1: you take a penny and you put it in the groove and if you can't cover half the penny Then you need new time.

63
00:04:36,457 --> 00:04:36,698
Speaker 1: well the

64
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:48,804
Speaker 0: actual way you tell is that they're wearing wear things and you look in the tread and if the tread is worn down to the point where it's level with the indicator then your car is now at the minimum tread level if not below it and you have to get them replaced.

65
00:04:49,426 --> 00:04:49,586
Speaker 1: mmm-hmm.

66
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:54,037
Speaker 0: now if Your tires are just worn on the edges Then it's usually not that big of a deal.

67
00:04:54,539 --> 00:04:55,604
Speaker 1: now my tires are.

68
00:04:55,865 --> 00:04:57,070
Speaker 1: I'm gonna need new ones pretty soon.

69
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,697
Speaker 0: You shouldn't need tires that often.

70
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:58,979
Speaker 1: No.

71
00:04:59,019 --> 00:05:01,190
Speaker 1: I think they were shitty tires, and I think I drove them.

72
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:03,622
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean the tires that the car came with the brand new car.

73
00:05:03,763 --> 00:05:09,644
Speaker 0: Yep that one uh-huh That's an interesting hypothesis, and I can't wait to see how well this all pans out.

74
00:05:09,664 --> 00:05:11,450
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna get new tires.

75
00:05:11,994 --> 00:05:21,781
Speaker 0: Anyway so in the news There's been this lawsuit against internet archive org Which is a really cool website that kind of archives the internet.

76
00:05:22,263 --> 00:05:30,403
Speaker 0: so say you've got a website in 1997 they take a snapshot of it and then in 2007 there's another snapshot and there's snapshots all along the way.

77
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:31,408
Speaker 1: that way you can you know.

78
00:05:31,468 --> 00:05:31,990
Speaker 1: see hey?

79
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:33,350
Speaker 1: What did Google look like in?

80
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:34,672
Speaker 1: 1999?

81
00:05:34,672 --> 00:05:35,615
Speaker 1: and you can go find out.

82
00:05:36,017 --> 00:05:37,562
Speaker 1: it's a really cool thing Google exist in.

83
00:05:37,663 --> 00:05:39,790
Speaker 0: I don't think I've always played around with this site.

84
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,573
Speaker 0: I like going to it.

85
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:49,730
Speaker 0: well a while ago this crazy lady sued them for Cashing her crazy website, and this has suddenly been in the media.

86
00:05:50,113 --> 00:05:52,610
Speaker 0: So I thought I'd talk about it as a little blurb or thing of the day.

87
00:05:52,630 --> 00:06:00,170
Speaker 0: I wasn't really gonna do news about it But then I fell down the rabbit hole and there was far more to this than met the eye.

88
00:06:00,932 --> 00:06:13,910
Speaker 0: So this woman has this website now before we go any further because this woman seems to be suing everyone on the planet I would like to point out that everything I am about to say is hearsay that I read on other websites on the internet.

89
00:06:14,516 --> 00:06:15,890
Speaker 0: I am NOT asserting anything.

90
00:06:16,191 --> 00:06:21,730
Speaker 0: I am merely pointing out things that I have read on the internet that may or may not be true.

91
00:06:22,371 --> 00:06:24,858
Speaker 0: Uh-huh so with that disclaimer aside.

92
00:06:25,239 --> 00:06:29,590
Speaker 0: There is a woman named Suzanne shell and she has this crazy website.

93
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:33,241
Speaker 0: I'm not really sure what it advocates because it's all over the place.

94
00:06:33,281 --> 00:06:33,783
Speaker 0: It's one of those.

95
00:06:33,803 --> 00:06:36,090
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just nuttiness.

96
00:06:36,452 --> 00:06:48,190
Speaker 0: Oh, you know those you know those kind of websites that have a million Semi-revolutionary quotes and a whole bunch of kind of rambling text and a bunch of like Neil Adams website and the time cube website.

97
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:55,275
Speaker 0: Yeah Lots of red text and different font sizes and links and the text is all over the place and there's frames Business all over.

98
00:06:55,917 --> 00:06:59,050
Speaker 0: in fact this site even has a pop-up before you can even go to it.

99
00:06:59,495 --> 00:07:01,153
Speaker 0: I think it's some JavaScript thing I didn't really look.

100
00:07:01,475 --> 00:07:06,475
Speaker 0: that asks you if you agree to the terms of service to view the website But it doesn't show you the terms of service.

101
00:07:06,736 --> 00:07:11,810
Speaker 0: huh well it either advocates for or against child protective services.

102
00:07:12,214 --> 00:07:13,387
Speaker 0: I am not sure which.

103
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,910
Speaker 0: Huh, it's generally nutty in my opinion.

104
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:20,562
Speaker 1: I would agree with that opinion.

105
00:07:20,642 --> 00:07:22,490
Speaker 1: so I didn't even read anything on the site.

106
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,435
Speaker 1: I just looked at it.

107
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:24,280
Speaker 1: I said wow that's nutty.

108
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:25,950
Speaker 0: so at the bottom of this website.

109
00:07:26,372 --> 00:07:29,146
Speaker 0: There is a great amount of text and this tech.

110
00:07:29,166 --> 00:07:29,890
Speaker 0: you should go to the website.

111
00:07:30,011 --> 00:07:38,090
Speaker 0: It's pretty funny to look at but at the bottom There's all this text and this woman has this really warped idea of how the internet works.

112
00:07:38,391 --> 00:07:48,426
Speaker 0: And I'll copyright works and everything works and it goes so far as to talk about the $5,000 licensing fee for cashing or reproducing her site anywhere and how to buy a license to print it.

113
00:07:48,446 --> 00:07:58,150
Speaker 0: and She has this whole crazy rant about how she disabled right-clicking and Printing and all that stuff because people were ripping her off or using her website against other people.

114
00:07:58,712 --> 00:08:04,994
Speaker 1: This is like those people who say that if you go to a website and blocking ads you're stealing because looking at the ad is The price of admission.

115
00:08:05,054 --> 00:08:06,520
Speaker 1: guess what have you noticed that?

116
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:07,584
Speaker 1: other websites?

117
00:08:07,624 --> 00:08:09,110
Speaker 1: Don't say that crazy shit.

118
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,295
Speaker 1: Have you noticed other websites?

119
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:11,621
Speaker 1: don't have these crazy agreements.

120
00:08:12,084 --> 00:08:13,370
Speaker 1: You know as you're the odd one out.

121
00:08:13,832 --> 00:08:14,737
Speaker 1: Maybe you're not.

122
00:08:14,858 --> 00:08:16,870
Speaker 1: maybe you've never seen another website in your life.

123
00:08:17,352 --> 00:08:26,430
Speaker 1: if you don't want your shit to be printed or saved as or Used in other places on the internet don't put it on the internet.

124
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:33,153
Speaker 0: I'm actually of the mind that anything that is lawfully published to the internet on a public web server should.

125
00:08:33,173 --> 00:08:45,955
Speaker 0: there should be some sort of safe harbor law saying that as long as it was published legally and in no violation of its own copyright or other copyrights then anyone has the right to copy and Disseminate that information with.

126
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:48,643
Speaker 0: I mean, obviously I agree with very easy to that.

127
00:08:48,963 --> 00:08:51,030
Speaker 0: at least cashing should be okay.

128
00:08:51,351 --> 00:08:57,850
Speaker 1: Cashing and content parsing I mean just someone visiting her website is caching it in their web browser.

129
00:08:58,092 --> 00:09:00,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not paying her five thousand dollars.

130
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:00,431
Speaker 0: You know what.

131
00:09:00,592 --> 00:09:08,037
Speaker 1: I visited the site about five times since I read this bit and disabling right-clicking and printing with JavaScripts or whatever guess what doesn't work.

132
00:09:08,358 --> 00:09:10,184
Speaker 1: someone who's smart enough.

133
00:09:10,586 --> 00:09:11,830
Speaker 1: That's not gonna work on them.

134
00:09:12,031 --> 00:09:13,521
Speaker 1: I can still print it if I want your.

135
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:14,910
Speaker 1: you know bullshit is not getting him.

136
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:26,090
Speaker 0: I remember in the 90s when I first went to a where site and I was trying to download stuff And I right-clicked on something and this pop-up thing appeared and said hey You can't right-click you gotta pay to get access to blah blah blah blah.

137
00:09:26,853 --> 00:09:32,394
Speaker 0: And then I turned off JavaScript and then I right-clicked and I downloaded my wares That's right.

138
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:33,658
Speaker 0: That was great.

139
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,790
Speaker 0: So that that alone would have just been a crazy woman.

140
00:09:38,346 --> 00:10:00,447
Speaker 0: well the internet picked up on this the lawsuit and all that and dig at a story and a bunch of other sites had stories and this woman started getting a lot of hits and A lot of hate mail and there was a lot of articles all over the place talking about how crazy she is And that pushed her over the edge And she it looks like she was even posting on dig defending herself as best.

141
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:04,750
Speaker 1: this crazy woman came But she does what most crazy people do and they were react crazily.

142
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:09,670
Speaker 1: It's sort of like where a troll is usually one guy who gets a whole bunch of people to go nuts.

143
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:18,870
Speaker 1: It's sort of like the opposite where a whole bunch of people do a simultaneous Troll targeted at one person to make them go nuts and this lady went all around the internet going nuts.

144
00:10:19,433 --> 00:10:22,230
Speaker 1: We basically like it was like a little bear in a cave.

145
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,930
Speaker 1: We poked it with a stick and ran away and everyone's sitting there watching to see what it's gonna do and they all laugh.

146
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,564
Speaker 0: Hahaha, so now apparently she's suing a bunch of people.

147
00:10:30,604 --> 00:10:32,090
Speaker 0: I think she said she's gonna sue dig.

148
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:38,610
Speaker 0: Apparently she wrote this crazy rant on her website, which I would just recommend you go read.

149
00:10:38,690 --> 00:10:47,017
Speaker 0: She's got a bunch of facts as to why she's mad and she's mad about all these iGeeks she calls and then she has a footnote Denoting that iGeek means internet geek.

150
00:10:47,518 --> 00:10:50,586
Speaker 0: and oh you internet geeks have your panties all in a twat.

151
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:51,870
Speaker 0: about this blah blah blah.

152
00:10:52,211 --> 00:11:00,137
Speaker 0: You just don't understand how the laws work and you guys want everything blah, but it's just it's so you're living in the year 1929.

153
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,183
Speaker 1: get with the times.

154
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:02,230
Speaker 1: we're gonna kick your ass.

155
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:11,641
Speaker 0: If any of you can get through her site enough to tell me what her opinion is on Anything other than this whole dig business.

156
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:16,338
Speaker 0: whatever what your stance actually is I Won't give you anything, but that'd be interesting.

157
00:11:16,739 --> 00:11:18,668
Speaker 0: now the rabbit hole gets deeper.

158
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:25,850
Speaker 0: now This is all hearsay And I'm gonna start with the things that are more verifiable and go toward the things that might just be outright lies.

159
00:11:26,232 --> 00:11:39,045
Speaker 0: Alright, so apparently in 2005 she demanded that the Internet Archive pay her like a hundred thousand dollars For archiving her website multiple times between 1999 and 2004.

160
00:11:39,045 --> 00:11:46,553
Speaker 1: all I got to say is we know it's craziness And there's no way it's gonna happen, but if she succeeds we are loaded Cha-ching.

161
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:54,139
Speaker 0: well among other things she seems to think that spidering her website is impossible because of the safeguard She has but to even if it's not possible.

162
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,267
Speaker 0: It should be illegal and you should have to pay.

163
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:59,608
Speaker 0: obviously She's never heard of robots dot text.

164
00:12:01,152 --> 00:12:10,147
Speaker 1: Yeah, and if she has heard of robots dot text The only reason robots dot text works is because search engines decide that they are going to pay attention to it.

165
00:12:10,187 --> 00:12:20,506
Speaker 1: like Google respects Robot dot text if Google comes to your site, and they want to you know put it in the Google index They first look at robots dot text and they say hey does this person want to be in Google?

166
00:12:20,867 --> 00:12:27,510
Speaker 1: and if the robots dot text Says no Google is nice, and they won't put you in Google Yeah, which really only hurts you unless you're doing something shady.

167
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:33,630
Speaker 1: Yep, if I wanted to make a search engine I could just make a search engine that doesn't give it two shits about robots That text and spider you anyway.

168
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:38,190
Speaker 1: It's not a goddamn thing you could do about it besides making your website non-public.

169
00:12:38,832 --> 00:12:47,437
Speaker 0: Well the just the legal system seemed to agree with archive org and threw out almost all of her claims Summarily and without any consideration.

170
00:12:47,798 --> 00:12:49,744
Speaker 1: see did she not learn her lesson.

171
00:12:49,784 --> 00:12:50,847
Speaker 1: Why would you ever try?

172
00:12:50,947 --> 00:12:51,048
Speaker 0: Oh?

173
00:12:51,329 --> 00:12:51,409
Speaker 0: Oh?

174
00:12:51,509 --> 00:12:51,569
Speaker 0: Oh?

175
00:12:52,251 --> 00:12:53,075
Speaker 0: Learning her lesson?

176
00:12:53,357 --> 00:13:02,881
Speaker 0: well apparently now according to this in 2001 the Colorado Supreme Court charged her with unauthorized practice of law Uh-huh.

177
00:13:03,103 --> 00:13:14,329
Speaker 0: and in I think 2004 maybe 2005 she was cited in another court for contempt of court for ignoring the 2001 order and then apparently in 2006 this happened again.

178
00:13:15,614 --> 00:13:18,201
Speaker 1: I wonder what law she's practicing crazy law now.

179
00:13:18,422 --> 00:13:29,830
Speaker 0: I would have I believe that hearsay because on her website She has this crazy rant about unauthorized practice of law and how it's unconstitutional And morally wrong for there to be any restrictions on anyone practicing law.

180
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:32,337
Speaker 0: Now I have feelings.

181
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:35,530
Speaker 1: I got a slight agreement with that, but not much.

182
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,610
Speaker 1: I mean you can't just have people running around being lawyers willy-nilly.

183
00:13:39,811 --> 00:13:44,870
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I agree with the right of anyone to defend themselves in court if they feel that that is what they should do.

184
00:13:44,910 --> 00:13:50,769
Speaker 1: But you cannot go for you know Representing someone else in court without proper training and skills.

185
00:13:50,869 --> 00:13:53,425
Speaker 1: now You could just be you could just suck.

186
00:13:53,505 --> 00:13:54,170
Speaker 1: really bad.

187
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:58,175
Speaker 1: I mean if someone decides to represent themselves And they suck at it That's their own fault.

188
00:13:58,517 --> 00:14:08,864
Speaker 1: if someone chooses you to represent them in court And you suck at it Then it's sort of your fault And you shouldn't be allowed to take that fault unless you pass that bar thing.

189
00:14:09,045 --> 00:14:24,330
Speaker 0: well the problem with all that is just that When it comes to more mundane things like a renters agreement, or let's say Software licenses someone techno Technological who doesn't have a law degree or isn't a paralegal and where this all varies from state to state.

190
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:34,601
Speaker 0: I don't think someone like me should be barred from giving advice on Software licenses provided that someone like me makes it clear not a lawyer.

191
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:35,102
Speaker 0: Yep.

192
00:14:35,423 --> 00:14:36,526
Speaker 1: I agree however.

193
00:14:36,806 --> 00:14:41,749
Speaker 0: It seems like New York State is actually extremely down on that sort of thing.

194
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:45,586
Speaker 1: See I think you should be able to give anyone advice on anything.

195
00:14:45,646 --> 00:14:46,330
Speaker 1: it's free speech.

196
00:14:46,811 --> 00:14:49,601
Speaker 1: You know if it's legal advice just like if it's doctor advice.

197
00:14:49,621 --> 00:14:52,330
Speaker 1: you say I'm not a doctor, but I recommend this medicine.

198
00:14:52,471 --> 00:14:55,407
Speaker 1: You know I'm not a lawyer, but I recommend this law.

199
00:14:55,427 --> 00:15:01,950
Speaker 0: yep Well, I'd be great with a law that says how prominently you have to point out that you're not a lawyer How often you have to say it that sort of thing?

200
00:15:02,090 --> 00:15:06,350
Speaker 0: Maybe you should wear a big yellow star on your arm that says I'm not a lawyer whenever you're trying to pull that.

201
00:15:07,572 --> 00:15:08,837
Speaker 0: But I digress.

202
00:15:09,178 --> 00:15:12,230
Speaker 0: so this woman's obviously according to the internet a nutjob.

203
00:15:13,251 --> 00:15:14,296
Speaker 1: Hooray nutjobs.

204
00:15:14,818 --> 00:15:17,349
Speaker 0: I'm not sure what else I could say about this other than that.

205
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:23,590
Speaker 0: Here's the final bit and I saw this said in three different locations by apparently three different people.

206
00:15:24,011 --> 00:15:35,090
Speaker 0: They claim that this woman has ties to the Church of Scientology Well that explains her legal tactics and that her website is basically a trap in order to bring about lawsuits.

207
00:15:35,872 --> 00:15:37,076
Speaker 1: That could be so also.

208
00:15:37,096 --> 00:15:41,529
Speaker 0: they also claim that the Church of Scientology did this with a number of front organizations throughout the years.

209
00:15:41,549 --> 00:15:41,569
Speaker 0: I?

210
00:15:42,630 --> 00:15:44,341
Speaker 0: Do not know if this is true or not.

211
00:15:44,502 --> 00:15:50,228
Speaker 1: it is entirely hearsay I find likely because it's very similar to the legal tactics of the Church of Scientology.

212
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:56,750
Speaker 0: I Find internet references to it, and I'm just going to relay it all to you because I find it hilarious.

213
00:15:57,377 --> 00:16:01,469
Speaker 1: It is quite hilarious Alright, so this is guy named.

214
00:16:01,811 --> 00:16:05,323
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say I actually can't pronounce this name right which I'm usually very good at.

215
00:16:05,824 --> 00:16:07,410
Speaker 1: it's Dilip koteta.

216
00:16:07,871 --> 00:16:11,143
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, I L I P K O T E CHA right?

217
00:16:11,183 --> 00:16:12,167
Speaker 0: what nationality is that?

218
00:16:12,227 --> 00:16:13,050
Speaker 1: I have no clue.

219
00:16:13,753 --> 00:16:14,917
Speaker 1: He looks like a nice guy though.

220
00:16:15,118 --> 00:16:15,640
Speaker 1: It's like an old.

221
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,420
Speaker 1: He's looking old man looks kind of like my grandpa only thinner I can't really tell.

222
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:28,350
Speaker 1: anyway He's a. he's basically a retired guy who used to work in the food manufacturing industry, but he's not retired anymore.

223
00:16:29,013 --> 00:16:33,494
Speaker 1: Now he runs a business in instant yogurt, it's Got.

224
00:16:33,675 --> 00:16:34,522
Speaker 1: it's called yo kit.

225
00:16:34,623 --> 00:16:34,845
Speaker 1: Why?

226
00:16:34,945 --> 00:16:42,650
Speaker 1: ok it It's like an instant cup of yogurt that lasts for 12 months on the shelf And he's you know thinking about using it for all sorts.

227
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:45,649
Speaker 1: He's gonna make a lot of money from this yogurt probably if I if it tastes good.

228
00:16:46,332 --> 00:16:47,255
Speaker 1: But that's not the news.

229
00:16:47,315 --> 00:16:48,819
Speaker 1: a guy making yogurt who gives a shit.

230
00:16:49,381 --> 00:17:01,278
Speaker 1: the news is the way he made this yogurt is He basically had a patent Donated to him from a bigger company that had figured out instant yogurt And they weren't using the patent.

231
00:17:01,599 --> 00:17:05,875
Speaker 1: so they gave it to this small time entrepreneur guy And he took the patent and he went nuts.

232
00:17:05,915 --> 00:17:10,609
Speaker 1: and now he's got a successful yogurt business and trepanor and trepanor entrepreneur.

233
00:17:11,203 --> 00:17:14,398
Speaker 0: whatever People in the forums are gonna jump down your throat.

234
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:15,383
Speaker 0: I figured I'd preempt it.

235
00:17:15,604 --> 00:17:24,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, so Now there's this big movement cuz you know 90 to 95 percent of patents are just sitting there not doing anything.

236
00:17:25,174 --> 00:17:26,990
Speaker 1: You know no one's making any money off of them.

237
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:33,169
Speaker 1: they're just patents that companies collect over time in case they want to sue someone or in case they need one.

238
00:17:33,189 --> 00:17:44,605
Speaker 1: and You know there's a bunch of groups of people who are trying to encourage these big companies with useless Unused patents to donate them to small businesses.

239
00:17:45,007 --> 00:17:45,690
Speaker 0: I think that's cool.

240
00:17:46,072 --> 00:17:51,198
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing that bothers me about it, though This is sort of backwards when you think about it.

241
00:17:51,258 --> 00:17:57,709
Speaker 1: the point of the patent is that the small-time guy comes up with something And then he's protected from the big guys.

242
00:17:58,171 --> 00:18:03,427
Speaker 1: But now it's the small guy has to beg the big guys to let go of the idea.

243
00:18:03,487 --> 00:18:17,450
Speaker 1: He came up with Already that they just happen to have a patent on because they have a million patents and he can't take you know make his money off his idea without you know a Donation a nice donation from the guy who's already got more money.

244
00:18:17,491 --> 00:18:18,306
Speaker 1: He knows what to do with.

245
00:18:19,033 --> 00:18:27,997
Speaker 1: The other thing is if you're a big company with a lot of unused patents And you're donating them to one guy so he can make money What the hell donate them to?

246
00:18:28,017 --> 00:18:31,710
Speaker 1: like the world just give them up, so we everyone can do stuff.

247
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:39,684
Speaker 0: Maybe we need some sort of legislation that would Automatically release patents to the public domain if they're unused or under certain circumstance.

248
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:41,348
Speaker 1: I would say unused for six months.

249
00:18:41,409 --> 00:18:41,910
Speaker 1: It's gone.

250
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:44,422
Speaker 1: You know it's like you're not What?

251
00:18:44,564 --> 00:18:44,930
Speaker 1: well okay?

252
00:18:45,130 --> 00:18:46,295
Speaker 1: If you're not it's like.

253
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:50,090
Speaker 1: you don't have to be you know making money off it right now if I patent some gizmo.

254
00:18:50,210 --> 00:19:00,650
Speaker 1: You know and you know on the side I'm working on the gizmo as long as I'm still working on it You know, but if I forget about it for six months to a year that I'm done.

255
00:19:00,952 --> 00:19:01,898
Speaker 1: You know it's like what the hell.

256
00:19:01,918 --> 00:19:06,910
Speaker 1: if you're not making money off that invention You just made then why do you have a patent on it?

257
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:15,598
Speaker 1: You're just hurting everyone else by restricting everyone's freedom to invent and sell and make businesses around Whatever that thing crazy thing you patent it is.

258
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:22,245
Speaker 1: we shouldn't have to beg you to give it up to one small guy Who now can do whatever that thing is without competition.

259
00:19:22,526 --> 00:19:23,330
Speaker 0: well a lot of companies?

260
00:19:23,510 --> 00:19:25,959
Speaker 0: Just keep patents around as kind of a defensive tactic.

261
00:19:26,301 --> 00:19:33,109
Speaker 0: so if someone sues them for any sort of patent thing They can usually turn around and counter sue the other person for 10 or 15 other patent things.

262
00:19:33,189 --> 00:19:35,139
Speaker 1: yep There's a quote from an IBM guy.

263
00:19:35,179 --> 00:19:37,088
Speaker 1: of course cuz IBM is the king of patents.

264
00:19:37,108 --> 00:19:39,880
Speaker 0: God I mean, I'm still up for a patent at IBM.

265
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:40,723
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're ready for this.

266
00:19:41,225 --> 00:19:46,563
Speaker 1: IBM Corp has more than 40,000 patents according to company spokesman Steve Malkovich.

267
00:19:46,864 --> 00:19:48,530
Speaker 0: they pushed us to get patents every day.

268
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:51,221
Speaker 0: It was like get a patent yet got anything you can patent.

269
00:19:51,402 --> 00:19:52,767
Speaker 0: fill out this form will patent it.

270
00:19:53,069 --> 00:19:59,660
Speaker 1: yep Rather than give away their idle patents the company keeps them But allows some groups to use this technology for free.

271
00:20:00,121 --> 00:20:02,670
Speaker 1: they believe the strategy helps generate new innovation and growth.

272
00:20:02,911 --> 00:20:04,556
Speaker 1: You don't help generate new innovation and growth.

273
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:09,010
Speaker 1: stop fucking patenting everything so people could just do things well because that's a lie.

274
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,577
Speaker 0: Obviously the real answer is we have weapons.

275
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:16,430
Speaker 0: it basically patents in the modern corporate world are not actually patents in the old way.

276
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:20,292
Speaker 0: They were effectively economic nuclear weapons Mmm.

277
00:20:20,493 --> 00:20:25,308
Speaker 0: Where if anyone tries to nuke you you've got so many that you just destroy them in turn.

278
00:20:25,629 --> 00:20:33,850
Speaker 0: yep And if two big companies get into a tiff I can imagine all Sorts of hilarity, and I look forward to that day with great enthusiasm.

279
00:20:34,532 --> 00:20:38,886
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh apparently Suzanne Schell is a chicken farmer according to the internet.

280
00:20:38,906 --> 00:20:44,710
Speaker 1: uh-huh yeah This whole patent situation just gets worse and worse all the time, and it's really not good.

281
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:53,208
Speaker 1: I mean it says in the Constitution Patents are there to promote like people inventing and researching and trying new things.

282
00:20:53,649 --> 00:20:58,490
Speaker 1: now Patents are just hurting people from trying to invent new part of it's the patent.

283
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:06,112
Speaker 0: They had a certain term how long they would last and now technology moves so fast by the time a patent falls out of its Term.

284
00:21:06,595 --> 00:21:08,850
Speaker 0: it's been obsolete for seven years already.

285
00:21:09,352 --> 00:21:16,409
Speaker 1: Not only that but it's way too easy to get them and the patent office is not so good at choosing Which ones to approve and which ones not to approve?

286
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,937
Speaker 1: You know they pretty much let through all kinds of bullshit and don't let through good stuff.

287
00:21:28,228 --> 00:21:29,270
Speaker 0: things of the day.

288
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:35,930
Speaker 0: I'm sure you all remember at least know about the 1984 ad from Apple computers back in the day.

289
00:21:36,472 --> 00:21:39,642
Speaker 0: It's probably one of the most famous video advertisements ever.

290
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,308
Speaker 1: yep it played during the 84 Super Bowl.

291
00:21:42,191 --> 00:21:43,815
Speaker 1: It was for Macintoshes, and it's.

292
00:21:44,216 --> 00:21:51,679
Speaker 0: I really like the the aesthetic of it because I generally dislike 1984 like societies I'm really not a fan of the ad like other people are like.

293
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:55,190
Speaker 1: I recognize significance, but I don't enjoy watching it.

294
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,410
Speaker 1: I don't think it's fun or entertaining at all.

295
00:21:57,571 --> 00:22:04,604
Speaker 0: I like the ad except for the fact that it's advertising Apple and instead I don't care about what it's selling, but I ignore that in ads anyway.

296
00:22:04,644 --> 00:22:05,106
Speaker 0: I just like the.

297
00:22:05,186 --> 00:22:06,070
Speaker 0: I like the visuals.

298
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,936
Speaker 1: Oh, it has nothing to do with what it's selling.

299
00:22:07,997 --> 00:22:15,277
Speaker 1: even if the ad was for like you know Scott's like you know I I Still wouldn't like it.

300
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:19,529
Speaker 0: I just don't like it all right You're entitled to your incorrect opinion.

301
00:22:20,311 --> 00:22:20,994
Speaker 1: Talking about.

302
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:27,248
Speaker 0: well someone did something funny on the internet and actually NPR It's all politics did talk about this quite a bit.

303
00:22:27,811 --> 00:22:38,629
Speaker 0: Someone and no one knows who as yet unless this has changed in the last few hours Took that old ad and mashed it up with Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, and they also added an iPod to it.

304
00:22:39,331 --> 00:22:43,805
Speaker 0: It's very high quality, and it's basically an anti Hillary pro-obama ad.

305
00:22:43,845 --> 00:22:45,310
Speaker 0: that's pretty well done.

306
00:22:45,854 --> 00:22:47,789
Speaker 0: And the thing is that alone wouldn't be news.

307
00:22:48,273 --> 00:23:06,332
Speaker 0: But the fact that it got all over the internet And then it got on CNN and it's not all the major new media and everyone's talking about it and NPR I saw politics went into great detail about how they think this is the beginning of a new era in political advertising with these kind of underground Unaffiliated.

308
00:23:06,412 --> 00:23:13,518
Speaker 0: no one paid for them even if they violate laws or if they're really really negative or whatever Internet advertising.

309
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:19,990
Speaker 0: if someone really likes a candidate It's their right freedom of speech to say whatever they want as long as they don't violate any laws.

310
00:23:20,532 --> 00:23:34,470
Speaker 0: So as a result we're gonna see a lot of advertising for candidates That doesn't hit the mainstream media And they're speculating that this presidential election in 2008 is gonna be decided by the internet as opposed to by the traditional media.

311
00:23:34,611 --> 00:23:36,405
Speaker 1: Eventually it's gonna be decided by the internet.

312
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:40,800
Speaker 1: it Thing now a large portion of it will be and perhaps years.

313
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:42,464
Speaker 1: well the whole thing will be.

314
00:23:42,865 --> 00:23:43,687
Speaker 0: we've seen the trend.

315
00:23:43,707 --> 00:23:49,861
Speaker 0: I mean Howard Dean's Popularity existed solely because of his grassroots hippie internet action.

316
00:23:49,881 --> 00:23:53,874
Speaker 1: that is correct and Obama is more internet action going on than anyone Ever seen got.

317
00:23:53,934 --> 00:23:56,490
Speaker 0: Obama does a podcast and he has a pretty good radio voice.

318
00:23:56,951 --> 00:23:58,918
Speaker 1: Yeah, thing is I don't know how it's like.

319
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:02,110
Speaker 1: there's limits on how much you can spend in advertising and such.

320
00:24:02,651 --> 00:24:08,406
Speaker 1: So I think a lot of people are gonna do internet advertising and pretend that they didn't pay for it.

321
00:24:08,426 --> 00:24:16,590
Speaker 0: when they do obviously Especially I mean say you want to attack a candidate You don't want to be known as that candidate who attacks that other candidate.

322
00:24:17,052 --> 00:24:22,450
Speaker 0: So what if some guy who happens to be a friend of some other guy who happens to be a gopher on your campaign?

323
00:24:22,990 --> 00:24:25,820
Speaker 0: Makes a flash video of two Republican senator.

324
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:33,389
Speaker 0: Hopeful presidential candidates fellating each other And talking about how bad they are on whatever issue you're talking about.

325
00:24:33,891 --> 00:24:38,727
Speaker 0: There's nothing illegal about that because you can't prove the connection or that any money was traded.

326
00:24:39,208 --> 00:24:43,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's real Not looking too well for the campaign finance reforms.

327
00:24:43,781 --> 00:24:46,670
Speaker 0: I see I'm not so worried about campaign finance reform anymore.

328
00:24:46,791 --> 00:24:48,568
Speaker 0: I'm more worried about a lot of other issues.

329
00:24:48,891 --> 00:25:03,650
Speaker 1: See is the thing though in the short term it's gonna be sucky because now these people who have a lot of money are gonna Be even more likely to win and the other people can be less likely to lose because these people will afford To put like big-ass fancy ads that are you know gonna be all over the internet and get a lot of them.

330
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,175
Speaker 1: But at the same in a long run.

331
00:25:05,596 --> 00:25:09,570
Speaker 1: now if the internet is the decider I can make shit on the internet.

332
00:25:09,831 --> 00:25:21,647
Speaker 1: And now like I'd say maybe in like 12 to 16 years from now The small-time candidate can put just as many videos about him on the internet and he'll get known Without having to spend millions on TV ads.

333
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:38,152
Speaker 0: yep You can also get away with a lot more on the internet for now Because the culture on the internet as opposed to the meatspace culture that isn't on the internet Seems to be in a general way a lot more liberal not necessarily leftist But liberal in a general Libertine sense

334
00:25:38,393 --> 00:25:41,522
Speaker 1: and the word the way it was meant in say 1910.

335
00:25:41,522 --> 00:25:49,127
Speaker 0: so as a result you can say things on the internet to Appeal to certain kinds of voters that the voters who this wouldn't appeal to would never know.

336
00:25:49,167 --> 00:25:49,669
Speaker 0: you've said it.

337
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:53,885
Speaker 1: Yes, you can say things in places where you know other people won't see.

338
00:25:53,905 --> 00:26:00,270
Speaker 1: like if you say something on TV Pretty much everyone who votes is gonna see it, but if you go to say except us yes.

339
00:26:00,573 --> 00:26:04,978
Speaker 1: But if you go to like the geek nights forums And you say I love computers, and then you go over to

340
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,265
Speaker 0: the neo-luddite forums

341
00:26:07,767 --> 00:26:16,277
Speaker 1: the neo-luddite forums And you say man computers are terrible, and then you go to the pedophile forums And you say I'll let you guys slide.

342
00:26:16,317 --> 00:26:22,384
Speaker 1: then you go to the chat rooms where all the police are trying to catch pedophiles And you say I'm gonna catch all these bastards no one will ever know.

343
00:26:22,424 --> 00:26:23,629
Speaker 1: you said all these things.

344
00:26:24,672 --> 00:26:26,459
Speaker 0: For now yeah, but it's still.

345
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,323
Speaker 0: it's a useful tool.

346
00:26:27,906 --> 00:26:28,830
Speaker 1: yep alright.

347
00:26:28,971 --> 00:26:36,430
Speaker 1: So if you haven't been paying attention The latest hotness in the web 2.0 internets is this thing called Twitter.

348
00:26:36,874 --> 00:26:38,144
Speaker 0: I started listening to twit.

349
00:26:38,185 --> 00:26:40,840
Speaker 0: for some reason I don't know if I like it it.

350
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,830
Speaker 0: just if I turn it on I end up listening to it.

351
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,909
Speaker 0: Yep, that's that's pretty much it kind of kind of mesmerizing their voices cuz they have more expensive microphones than us.

352
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:50,435
Speaker 1: yeah I listen to two twits today.

353
00:26:50,516 --> 00:26:52,765
Speaker 1: anyway Twitter is the thing.

354
00:26:52,805 --> 00:26:54,090
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell you what it is in a second.

355
00:26:54,192 --> 00:26:57,519
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't know what it was But it has nothing to do with to it other than the twit.

356
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:00,089
Speaker 0: people use it and talk about it more than they show.

357
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:02,145
Speaker 1: they Talked about it recently in one episode.

358
00:27:02,165 --> 00:27:02,730
Speaker 1: a lot anyway.

359
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:08,410
Speaker 1: It is made by the people who made Odeo and the people who made Odeo printers giving up Odeo and doing Twitter now.

360
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:15,350
Speaker 0: Oh, huh, so they made Odeo which didn't work and was basically useless and now they're making Twitter.

361
00:27:15,831 --> 00:27:17,799
Speaker 1: Well Twitter's sort of made and done.

362
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:19,023
Speaker 1: There's really not much more.

363
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:19,626
Speaker 1: It can do so.

364
00:27:19,646 --> 00:27:20,770
Speaker 0: then what are they doing?

365
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:24,065
Speaker 1: Okay, Twitter is you ready for this.

366
00:27:24,105 --> 00:27:24,789
Speaker 1: This is really dumb.

367
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:32,186
Speaker 1: all you do is You can say a hundred and forty characters worth of text.

368
00:27:32,426 --> 00:27:35,313
Speaker 1: that answers the question What are you doing?

369
00:27:35,793 --> 00:27:43,784
Speaker 1: And you have a picture and you have a name and it also has a GPS coordinate and It says you know there are different ways to send.

370
00:27:43,824 --> 00:27:47,704
Speaker 1: you can send it by SMS You can send it by instant message, or you can send it on the website.

371
00:27:48,207 --> 00:27:48,629
Speaker 1: That's it.

372
00:27:49,051 --> 00:27:52,826
Speaker 1: So let's say here's an example of Twitter usage already.

373
00:27:53,087 --> 00:27:58,905
Speaker 1: I wake up in the morning I pick up my cell phone, and I say I just woke up smiley, and I push the button.

374
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:01,539
Speaker 1: now on my Twitter It says the time.

375
00:28:01,821 --> 00:28:05,478
Speaker 1: it says Beacon, New York And it says Scott you know it has exactly what I typed in.

376
00:28:05,538 --> 00:28:07,724
Speaker 1: I woke up hooray via SMS.

377
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:09,490
Speaker 1: then I take a shower.

378
00:28:09,994 --> 00:28:11,022
Speaker 1: I'm gonna take a shower.

379
00:28:11,063 --> 00:28:17,405
Speaker 1: so I go over to my computer And I log into the website, and I say I'm gonna take a shower now, and it says on Twitter I'm gonna take a shower now.

380
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:34,844
Speaker 1: Huh, and now anyone who befriends me on Twitter can see all these things that I'm saying about what I'm doing and Anyone that I befriend I can see what they're doing and I can have those things sent to me by SMS or instant message Or I can look at them on the web and some things are public.

381
00:28:34,865 --> 00:28:46,436
Speaker 1: you can just go to Twitter Twi tter calm and look at what things people are saying and doing in different places around the world and how they're saying those Things via SMS or I am or whatever.

382
00:28:46,777 --> 00:28:51,710
Speaker 0: so it's basically all the bad parts of myspace and LiveJournal without any of the good.

383
00:28:52,092 --> 00:28:55,616
Speaker 1: It's sort of like not in a way message But like a here message.

384
00:28:55,636 --> 00:29:00,581
Speaker 1: you have a constant here message that you just keep Changing only it just they keep adding on top.

385
00:29:00,782 --> 00:29:01,304
Speaker 1: all right.

386
00:29:01,384 --> 00:29:19,001
Speaker 0: I'm gonna qualify everything I'm about to say about this by stating that the idea of having a Constantly updating feed of what you were doing that people you care about can look at or that you can reference later to see what You did at certain times is Interesting and I can see uses for that.

387
00:29:19,645 --> 00:29:26,508
Speaker 0: this implementation I would say borders on the silly, but that's like saying that Alaska borders on the chili.

388
00:29:26,528 --> 00:29:29,299
Speaker 1: well Here's the thing is that that alone.

389
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:30,544
Speaker 1: You know I could go for that.

390
00:29:30,705 --> 00:29:31,890
Speaker 1: You know if it's just what are you doing?

391
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:32,954
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

392
00:29:33,517 --> 00:29:38,412
Speaker 1: people have pretty much taken this now And it's just a giant worldwide IRC.

393
00:29:38,773 --> 00:29:49,382
Speaker 1: people are friending thousands of people and being befriended by thousands of people and I see messages on here like here's one At Vincent Ferrari, what if the at is at you?

394
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,509
Speaker 1: question mark Smiley somebody is?

395
00:29:52,330 --> 00:29:55,760
Speaker 1: Talking to someone else by posting a worldwide message.

396
00:29:55,901 --> 00:30:03,310
Speaker 1: That's supposed to be what are you doing right now, but there's Specifically trying to say hey Vincent Ferrari look at this message.

397
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:06,545
Speaker 0: It's for you see now that at least is a little interesting.

398
00:30:06,586 --> 00:30:10,136
Speaker 0: It's kind of a global Stupid inane chat room.

399
00:30:10,557 --> 00:30:15,170
Speaker 1: It's just a worldwide IRC that you can only say a hundred and forty characters at once.

400
00:30:15,210 --> 00:30:16,750
Speaker 1: That's that's the opposite.

401
00:30:16,871 --> 00:30:18,317
Speaker 1: It would be cool if it was what it said.

402
00:30:18,337 --> 00:30:21,050
Speaker 1: it was gonna be but now it's just a worldwide IRS each.

403
00:30:21,431 --> 00:30:31,342
Speaker 0: Oh now while that is silly I I posit Scott who would have So little of a life that they would watch this?

404
00:30:31,684 --> 00:30:42,750
Speaker 0: the twits who would have So little going on that they have the time to constantly type 140 or so characters of what they're doing into a website?

405
00:30:43,152 --> 00:30:49,689
Speaker 1: Who would have so little time in life that they can sit here watching this sending chat Messages to the whole world and chatting with the whole world?

406
00:30:50,011 --> 00:30:53,064
Speaker 0: You know that's a little bit better than the original usage in my opinion.

407
00:30:53,345 --> 00:30:54,249
Speaker 1: I think that's worse.

408
00:30:54,772 --> 00:30:57,767
Speaker 1: Why don't you just you make an IRC channel and everyone join?

409
00:30:58,008 --> 00:30:58,390
Speaker 1: it's better.

410
00:30:58,853 --> 00:31:00,041
Speaker 0: Who is the bigger loser though?

411
00:31:00,081 --> 00:31:01,430
Speaker 0: the person who tells the world?

412
00:31:01,790 --> 00:31:07,189
Speaker 0: Constantly when they masturbate and when they take showers or the guy who watches that and feels enriched by it?

413
00:31:07,912 --> 00:31:08,454
Speaker 1: I don't know.

414
00:31:08,514 --> 00:31:12,210
Speaker 1: neither one is good, but anyway my thing of the day is not Twitter itself.

415
00:31:12,310 --> 00:31:16,485
Speaker 1: I just wanted to let you know what Twitter was because it's something you should probably make fun of.

416
00:31:16,767 --> 00:31:18,796
Speaker 1: make fun of because it's the Latest internet hotness.

417
00:31:18,997 --> 00:31:21,329
Speaker 0: I have a solution to Twitter, but I'll get to that in a bit right.

418
00:31:21,349 --> 00:31:24,558
Speaker 1: well The latest my thing of the day is Twitter vision.

419
00:31:24,578 --> 00:31:30,854
Speaker 1: you can go to Twitter vision calm TWI TTR vision calm or Twitter Map calm slash Twitter vision.

420
00:31:31,336 --> 00:31:32,940
Speaker 1: it's Twitter plus Google Maps.

421
00:31:33,041 --> 00:31:50,633
Speaker 1: basically you sit here looking at Google Maps and Whenever someone twitters it puts a little dot on the map and you see what they said and then it loads up some more Twitter's and you get to sit here, and you'll see pretty much every Twitter around the world where it is what they said Constantly.

422
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:54,629
Speaker 0: so I've got like three or four ideas for Twitter pranks already.

423
00:31:55,292 --> 00:32:02,477
Speaker 1: Apparently a lot of people using Twitter for marketing like it seems like in the UK somewhere There's a Twitter guy named fresh podcast.

424
00:32:02,517 --> 00:32:04,462
Speaker 1: He just keeps linking to podcasts.

425
00:32:04,743 --> 00:32:07,229
Speaker 1: Wow and I'm like who the hell is sitting here.

426
00:32:08,272 --> 00:32:12,302
Speaker 1: Wait watching what the this guy has to say to get a new podcast.

427
00:32:12,342 --> 00:32:14,488
Speaker 1: go to take podcasts and search for something.

428
00:32:14,548 --> 00:32:15,130
Speaker 1: what the hell?

429
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:17,054
Speaker 0: No number one.

430
00:32:17,595 --> 00:32:24,482
Speaker 0: perhaps someone sets their GPS stuff to be in the middle of North Korea, and then they post something like OMG I got internet access.

431
00:32:24,502 --> 00:32:29,141
Speaker 0: help me And wait for the Internet to react to that - - - -.

432
00:32:29,643 --> 00:32:31,490
Speaker 0: what if someone posts OMG?

433
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:42,562
Speaker 0: I saw a UFO and then silence or a bunch of people with the same GPS all post these UFO sightings all at once like in Montana and then silence from all of them forever more.

434
00:32:42,844 --> 00:32:45,751
Speaker 0: so the conspiracy nuts have a field day Now.

435
00:32:46,294 --> 00:32:47,299
Speaker 0: idea number three.

436
00:32:47,319 --> 00:32:51,825
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that military Engagements could end this right quick.

437
00:32:52,108 --> 00:32:57,830
Speaker 0: suppose We get all the rational people on the internet together and deploy the mighty cock boat army on Twitter.

438
00:32:58,911 --> 00:33:00,819
Speaker 1: Just start putting cock boats in there.

439
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:03,610
Speaker 1: cock boat 140 character long cock boats.

440
00:33:04,011 --> 00:33:06,619
Speaker 0: I'm talking about entire cock boat destroyer groups.

441
00:33:07,261 --> 00:33:07,843
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

442
00:33:07,863 --> 00:33:10,090
Speaker 0: now of course you would have to set your GPS coordinates.

443
00:33:10,171 --> 00:33:12,430
Speaker 0: So they were in fact in the Atlantic and Pacific Ocean.

444
00:33:14,153 --> 00:33:17,825
Speaker 0: Now if we coordinate this properly this could be utterly hilarious.

445
00:33:18,146 --> 00:33:20,889
Speaker 0: if the internet is with me We will put something together.

446
00:33:21,553 --> 00:33:24,990
Speaker 1: I think I might use the Twitter for just one day and then not use it again.

447
00:33:25,150 --> 00:33:25,955
Speaker 0: And then what review it?

448
00:33:26,458 --> 00:33:28,249
Speaker 1: no, but that way at least you know.

449
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:35,857
Speaker 1: It's like it is an important part of internet history because this is probably gonna be something that you know comes And then dies sort of like Odeo did.

450
00:33:36,038 --> 00:33:39,010
Speaker 0: and then 20 years later people say do you remember Twitter?

451
00:33:39,111 --> 00:33:41,470
Speaker 1: And I'm like haha use that for one day instead of haha.

452
00:33:41,771 --> 00:33:44,483
Speaker 1: I remember some people use that but I don't really remember what it was like.

453
00:33:44,604 --> 00:33:47,135
Speaker 0: we've already got a lot of things like that Though I mean Kingdom of Loathing.

454
00:33:47,216 --> 00:33:47,457
Speaker 1: Yep.

455
00:33:47,497 --> 00:33:47,678
Speaker 1: Yep.

456
00:33:47,778 --> 00:33:51,488
Speaker 1: It's sort of like how it's worth it to make a myspace account Even if you don't really use it.

457
00:33:51,731 --> 00:33:55,790
Speaker 1: It's sort of like how it's worth it to poke around live journal once just to know what it is.

458
00:33:55,890 --> 00:34:00,145
Speaker 1: You know be on Facebook once and that's that's so I'll be on Twitter once.

459
00:34:00,767 --> 00:34:01,590
Speaker 0: that ought to be interesting.

460
00:34:01,991 --> 00:34:02,634
Speaker 1: It might be.

461
00:34:03,115 --> 00:34:07,310
Speaker 0: you should keep a log of how many times you can't resist yours to just write an ASCII penis.

462
00:34:08,511 --> 00:34:08,953
Speaker 1: I don't know.

463
00:34:09,614 --> 00:34:09,775
Speaker 0: I have.

464
00:34:10,257 --> 00:34:13,949
Speaker 0: I will bet that that is going to be within the first two things you post on Twitter.

465
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,053
Speaker 1: No, I imagine.

466
00:34:15,092 --> 00:34:20,248
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna basically type in what I'm doing for 24 hours whenever I do something new.

467
00:34:20,268 --> 00:34:22,940
Speaker 1: Wow That's what it's supposed to be.

468
00:34:23,021 --> 00:34:24,109
Speaker 1: So that's the way I'm gonna use it.

469
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:27,730
Speaker 0: I just I don't see this being the best use of your time.

470
00:34:28,172 --> 00:34:28,995
Speaker 1: Well, I'm gonna try.

471
00:34:29,074 --> 00:34:32,810
Speaker 1: I think what I can do is I'll try to do with SMS or I am so it doesn't take very long.

472
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,799
Speaker 1: So tonight plus think about it.

473
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:35,744
Speaker 1: I mean at one point.

474
00:34:35,764 --> 00:34:39,237
Speaker 1: It's gonna be like I'm at work And like four hours later, I'm eating lunch.

475
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:40,621
Speaker 1: I'm done eating lunch.

476
00:34:40,842 --> 00:34:45,315
Speaker 1: I'm back to work then four hours later I'm going home.

477
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:51,462
Speaker 0: So tonight lately our how computers work series has been very popular among the listeners especially all the networking stuff.

478
00:34:52,068 --> 00:34:57,445
Speaker 0: and Also, we're very lazy and we haven't felt like talking about any technology topics lately.

479
00:34:57,806 --> 00:35:09,729
Speaker 1: Yeah technology topics I mean while we know a lot about technology There's only so much you can say about a lot of things and sometimes we have to do some research if it's not something We've used in regular daily life.

480
00:35:10,183 --> 00:35:16,309
Speaker 0: also we just generally are lazy and the fact that you guys seem to want these less technical how computers works as opposed to the.

481
00:35:16,831 --> 00:35:21,323
Speaker 0: Here are the frequency bands of 802 11 V channels kind of podcast.

482
00:35:21,363 --> 00:35:23,610
Speaker 1: Here's how Manchester encoding works.

483
00:35:23,790 --> 00:35:31,596
Speaker 1: All right Today we're gonna talk about something that you probably aren't familiar with But you should be.

484
00:35:32,138 --> 00:35:35,029
Speaker 1: we're going to talk about version control systems.

485
00:35:35,912 --> 00:35:44,550
Speaker 0: Now this is a topic that generally a lot of people think only applies to coders people who write well people even know What version control systems are in the first place?

486
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:48,380
Speaker 0: but this is the kind of thing that you might not even realize.

487
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:55,696
Speaker 0: you have this problem or you might have the problem and Not realize that there's a solution or you might not even Care.

488
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:57,004
Speaker 0: yeah, you might not.

489
00:35:57,346 --> 00:36:05,384
Speaker 0: but in general This is something that many people could be using to great effect to make their productivity and their lives Generally better and easier to manage.

490
00:36:05,746 --> 00:36:08,823
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm It is also something that is on slashdot.

491
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:10,110
Speaker 0: recently people were talking about.

492
00:36:10,652 --> 00:36:16,670
Speaker 0: I think that our Congress the United States Congress should be by law required to use something like this.

493
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:23,670
Speaker 0: I agree, but anyway version control is actually something very very simple.

494
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:30,630
Speaker 1: Yes, basically you have some sort of information that one or more people is working on.

495
00:36:31,192 --> 00:36:33,763
Speaker 1: However, this you know, let's pretend it's a document.

496
00:36:33,863 --> 00:36:35,068
Speaker 1: It's it's a word document.

497
00:36:35,148 --> 00:36:35,550
Speaker 1: That's fine.

498
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:38,382
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're writing a guide on how to cook a goat.

499
00:36:38,623 --> 00:36:40,370
Speaker 1: All right a guide on how to cook a goat, right?

500
00:36:40,712 --> 00:36:46,178
Speaker 1: so I write up the guide on how to cook a goat and Now rim wants to make some changes.

501
00:36:46,318 --> 00:36:48,606
Speaker 1: Yeah, obviously you're thinking about wiki's already.

502
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:49,710
Speaker 1: you people I know you are.

503
00:36:49,831 --> 00:37:03,030
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but you know Rim make some changes to it and then I make some changes and then Someone else make some changes and we keep updating and working on this guide to how to make a goat together or maybe just alone.

504
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:03,732
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

505
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:08,730
Speaker 0: Yep, but the thing is we're doing this by a traditional methods, you know, download the file edit it put it back up.

506
00:37:09,062 --> 00:37:09,210
Speaker 1: Yeah.

507
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:15,830
Speaker 1: And now if someone rim does that what if you're accidentally erased one of my paragraphs or he changed something?

508
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:18,509
Speaker 1: I did and I forget just how I said it.

509
00:37:18,610 --> 00:37:29,790
Speaker 1: Well the old versions unless we you know We could just keep a whole bunch of files and every time there's a new version of the document We make a whole new file and we've got all these files just lined up.

510
00:37:30,191 --> 00:37:37,470
Speaker 1: And now if I want to see what the difference is between version the newest version and the oldest version It's like a pain in the ass.

511
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:48,470
Speaker 1: And if I want to replace a part of the new version with a part of two versions ago It's also a pain in the ass and it basically is a pain in the ass and a lot of manual labor and it sucks.

512
00:37:48,792 --> 00:37:58,474
Speaker 0: and also it doesn't deal with a very Maybe not obvious problem, but a problem that comes up quite a bit whenever multiple people are working on any sort of project Especially in computers.

513
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:03,130
Speaker 0: It's kind of a race condition where the time that you start to edit something can matter.

514
00:38:03,211 --> 00:38:07,375
Speaker 0: Well, let's say I start I download it and start editing I start adding a paragraph and then

515
00:38:07,496 --> 00:38:09,482
Speaker 1: I downloaded it and I start deleting something

516
00:38:09,783 --> 00:38:18,060
Speaker 0: and then I put my version up which has my New paragraph and then Scott puts his version up that doesn't have my new paragraph But it has the things he took out and now

517
00:38:18,181 --> 00:38:18,503
Speaker 1: rims.

518
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:19,630
Speaker 1: work is gone.

519
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:20,978
Speaker 0: My work is gone.

520
00:38:21,058 --> 00:38:23,010
Speaker 0: Scott's work hasn't taken mine into account.

521
00:38:23,311 --> 00:38:26,950
Speaker 0: Maybe a third person was trying to edit but Scott didn't download the file.

522
00:38:27,211 --> 00:38:29,241
Speaker 0: He was working on the one on the server.

523
00:38:29,542 --> 00:38:31,270
Speaker 0: So the guy couldn't even write it back.

524
00:38:32,151 --> 00:38:33,736
Speaker 1: Yeah, now we've lost information.

525
00:38:33,796 --> 00:38:34,538
Speaker 0: Everything's chaotic.

526
00:38:34,558 --> 00:38:35,099
Speaker 0: Everything's done.

527
00:38:35,541 --> 00:38:38,850
Speaker 1: So the solution is to have a version control system.

528
00:38:38,890 --> 00:38:49,225
Speaker 1: You know how when you get software and software says it's version 1.0 or 1.1 or 2.3 or whatever Those numbers come from version control systems.

529
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:49,687
Speaker 1: people didn't.

530
00:38:49,707 --> 00:38:50,651
Speaker 1: just you know make.

531
00:38:50,912 --> 00:38:54,100
Speaker 1: I mean everyone has a different system for how the numbers work.

532
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:57,590
Speaker 1: like the Linux kernel does the numbers by.

533
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:07,374
Speaker 1: you know 2.6 is the series and then like dot 25 is the 25th kernel and the 2.6 series and Ubuntu does it by the date?

534
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:17,564
Speaker 1: So edgy is 610 because it came out on June, you know 10. or it was like No, it came out in October of 06. that's why it's a lot of programs.

535
00:39:17,584 --> 00:39:19,230
Speaker 0: just do the major-minor.

536
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,159
Speaker 0: So version 1.0 is the first major release.

537
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:23,182
Speaker 0: 1.1 is a minor update.

538
00:39:23,182 --> 00:39:23,985
Speaker 0: 1.2 is another minor update.

539
00:39:23,985 --> 00:39:27,865
Speaker 0: 2.0 is the second major release.

540
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:28,510
Speaker 0: Yeah sort of thing.

541
00:39:28,711 --> 00:39:33,610
Speaker 1: Everyone uses a different system of numbering but those numberings come from the version control systems.

542
00:39:34,032 --> 00:39:41,745
Speaker 0: Now there are a lot of ways to do this and we're really not going to go into technical depth But you might have heard of terms like CVS or subversion or RCS.

543
00:39:41,905 --> 00:39:42,849
Speaker 1: Those are pretty much the big three.

544
00:39:43,751 --> 00:39:52,403
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's a lot of people do it manually partly because they might not know that there are content management systems out there That'll do this for them and version things for them or two.

545
00:39:52,463 --> 00:39:55,916
Speaker 0: They might just not Understand that this is a good thing.

546
00:39:55,936 --> 00:39:59,070
Speaker 0: Maybe they're crazy Luddites and maybe they don't like CVS.

547
00:39:59,492 --> 00:40:07,729
Speaker 1: Well, some people use like the stuff that's built into Microsoft Office and Word But that stuff really sucks compared to what CVS and others already do.

548
00:40:08,191 --> 00:40:11,784
Speaker 1: Basically how these version control systems work is not too complicated.

549
00:40:12,125 --> 00:40:20,449
Speaker 1: you have some sort of Repository where all of the stuff that is being all the stuff everyone is working on sits there.

550
00:40:20,710 --> 00:40:21,975
Speaker 0: now This could be a database.

551
00:40:22,035 --> 00:40:22,799
Speaker 0: It could be a file.

552
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:25,450
Speaker 0: It could be a directory with just all the version files in it.

553
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,836
Speaker 1: It could be on your computer.

554
00:40:26,917 --> 00:40:28,765
Speaker 1: It could be on a server somewhere else.

555
00:40:28,906 --> 00:40:29,870
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter.

556
00:40:30,071 --> 00:40:32,480
Speaker 0: It could be a safe deposit box in a bank.

557
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:32,801
Speaker 0: Yep.

558
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:43,193
Speaker 1: It's a place where all the information Sits about everything that has ever been done to the things you are working on from the oldest version to the newest version and It just sits there.

559
00:40:43,675 --> 00:40:43,875
Speaker 1: now.

560
00:40:44,136 --> 00:40:47,690
Speaker 1: the way it works is when you want to work on something you check it out.

561
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:52,186
Speaker 1: So let's say there's a project me and rim are working on say the latest episode of geek night.

562
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:53,210
Speaker 1: It's in there.

563
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:54,475
Speaker 1: It's in the repository.

564
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,041
Speaker 1: the work that's already been done is in there.

565
00:40:56,542 --> 00:40:57,687
Speaker 1: I'm just sitting at a computer.

566
00:40:57,727 --> 00:40:58,450
Speaker 1: That's brand new.

567
00:40:59,052 --> 00:41:00,837
Speaker 1: So I connect to the repository.

568
00:41:00,857 --> 00:41:03,405
Speaker 1: However, you connect to it network hard drive, whatever.

569
00:41:03,546 --> 00:41:04,308
Speaker 1: I check it out.

570
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:10,770
Speaker 1: now I've got the version of the work the newest one that was in the repository because I checked out the newest one.

571
00:41:10,810 --> 00:41:11,919
Speaker 1: I could have checked out an older one.

572
00:41:12,604 --> 00:41:13,410
Speaker 1: I start working on it.

573
00:41:13,771 --> 00:41:15,337
Speaker 1: I edit the copy that I checked out.

574
00:41:15,698 --> 00:41:16,220
Speaker 1: now rim.

575
00:41:16,261 --> 00:41:17,786
Speaker 1: he checks out and he's working on it.

576
00:41:18,469 --> 00:41:20,679
Speaker 1: now There are two other things I can do.

577
00:41:21,041 --> 00:41:21,684
Speaker 1: well major.

578
00:41:21,784 --> 00:41:24,577
Speaker 1: there are lots of things you can do But the major ones are update.

579
00:41:25,039 --> 00:41:29,137
Speaker 1: update says alright, I've got what I've the work I've done it right in front of me.

580
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:39,990
Speaker 1: go look on that repository And if there's anything newer there that was changed since I checked out Bring that down to me so I can incorporate it into what I've just done.

581
00:41:40,479 --> 00:41:40,990
Speaker 1: That's update.

582
00:41:41,491 --> 00:41:47,430
Speaker 1: The other thing you can do is commit which says take what I've got right here and put it in as the next version.

583
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:49,657
Speaker 1: So check this out.

584
00:41:49,757 --> 00:41:51,322
Speaker 1: rim starts working on it.

585
00:41:51,443 --> 00:41:52,306
Speaker 1: I start working on it.

586
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:53,630
Speaker 1: rim updates.

587
00:41:53,710 --> 00:41:56,102
Speaker 1: He sees that nothing happened as so he commits.

588
00:41:56,363 --> 00:41:57,749
Speaker 1: now rims version is in there.

589
00:41:58,033 --> 00:42:02,180
Speaker 1: It's in the repository But I'm working on the previous version to what rim is done.

590
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:10,910
Speaker 1: before I commit my work right on top of rims work I update now rims changes that he just did come down and I look at what I've done and I look at what rims done.

591
00:42:11,354 --> 00:42:17,363
Speaker 1: I mix them together, which is real easy And then I commit and now our work isn't lost.

592
00:42:17,423 --> 00:42:24,870
Speaker 1: it's in there and everything's cool plus I can go in and I can say all kinds of cool stuff like show me the difference between this version and the last version.

593
00:42:26,012 --> 00:42:30,070
Speaker 1: Give me the older version because the new version sucks all kinds of cool stuff like that.

594
00:42:30,231 --> 00:42:31,819
Speaker 1: It's nice and easy and everything's awesome.

595
00:42:32,081 --> 00:42:32,161
Speaker 0: Now.

596
00:42:32,202 --> 00:42:33,730
Speaker 0: You can see how this is a great advantage.

597
00:42:33,872 --> 00:42:45,110
Speaker 0: I mean without version control you're eventually gonna have a mess and you're very much limited in the number of people who can be working on one project or the Number of people who can collaborate simultaneously.

598
00:42:45,692 --> 00:42:51,710
Speaker 1: You're also much more likely to lose lots of data and have a pain in the ass time, especially if you're working on software.

599
00:42:52,071 --> 00:42:58,774
Speaker 0: Yep, now to with simple primitive version control the most primitive forms Generally just involved.

600
00:42:59,115 --> 00:43:03,992
Speaker 0: if I check a file out like before any of this or I just I'm using a file and someone else tries To edit it.

601
00:43:04,052 --> 00:43:06,420
Speaker 0: It says hey someone else is editing this.

602
00:43:06,742 --> 00:43:07,665
Speaker 0: don't fuck with it.

603
00:43:07,846 --> 00:43:13,410
Speaker 0: That's what RCS does Yep, and while that's not great at least you don't lose data anymore.

604
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:21,959
Speaker 0: It slows down productivity because now if Scott's working I can't work and if I'm working Scott can't work But at the same time at least you're not gonna lose anything

605
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:25,010
Speaker 1: and at least you can still keep track of different versions of something

606
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:31,030
Speaker 0: Yep, which is very important because then you can track back who added what when you can figure out when problems appeared.

607
00:43:31,412 --> 00:43:35,130
Speaker 0: Maybe someone likes an old version and you want to incorporate that into a newer version.

608
00:43:35,731 --> 00:43:43,986
Speaker 0: Maybe you want to split off and fork but we'll talk about that in a second Yep, and really in general you can just get a lot more done a lot more quickly.

609
00:43:44,047 --> 00:43:47,315
Speaker 0: people can collaborate Simultaneously on single projects.

610
00:43:47,717 --> 00:43:54,969
Speaker 1: you think about what it'd be like if say you were trying to write a book a big instruction manual For something and there were like a hundred people on the team.

611
00:43:55,391 --> 00:43:58,681
Speaker 1: It's basically impossible without a version control system of some sort.

612
00:43:59,142 --> 00:44:00,527
Speaker 1: It's as essential as the hammer.

613
00:44:00,828 --> 00:44:06,379
Speaker 1: without this tool You couldn't hammer a goddamn nail But because of the tool we can do amazing things.

614
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,130
Speaker 0: now to look at a very practical semi non technical application.

615
00:44:10,371 --> 00:44:13,043
Speaker 0: I said a bit before about the Congress of the United States.

616
00:44:13,485 --> 00:44:30,740
Speaker 0: for those of you who aren't American Which is a good number of you the way laws work in America basically boils down to the fact that very few of our elected representatives actually read any laws that they vote for or against Partly because there's so many laws Partly because the laws are long and all sorts of problems.

617
00:44:31,242 --> 00:44:33,330
Speaker 0: as a result a lot of AIDS end up doing the work.

618
00:44:33,971 --> 00:44:41,551
Speaker 0: It's not that difficult for someone to just change a law and not tell anyone and then no one will notice and they'll vote on It.

619
00:44:42,055 --> 00:44:45,410
Speaker 0: it happened recently pretty spectacularly actually.

620
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:52,912
Speaker 1: Yeah, also lots of laws like a law will be like the funding of the something-something act of 2007.

621
00:44:52,912 --> 00:44:57,510
Speaker 1: But when you look at the law like the beginning part of it might have something to do with funding the something-something.

622
00:44:57,931 --> 00:45:01,464
Speaker 1: But then after that it says oh and by the way give money to rim.

623
00:45:01,665 --> 00:45:05,403
Speaker 1: Oh and by the way, you can't Build a school in Connecticut.

624
00:45:05,524 --> 00:45:11,971
Speaker 1: Oh and by the way You can build a bridge in Alaska all in favor of the Springfield slash pervert act I.

625
00:45:14,955 --> 00:45:16,930
Speaker 0: But yeah, so how would you deal with this?

626
00:45:17,191 --> 00:45:27,050
Speaker 0: Well Congress has tried to deal with it in various ineffective ways Even though something like CVS or any sort of version control system would all but eliminate this problem.

627
00:45:27,371 --> 00:45:33,470
Speaker 1: Plus the other problem we have in the US government is we got these two branches of the legislative branch, you know two legislative branches

628
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:34,312
Speaker 0: yeah, and

629
00:45:34,694 --> 00:45:46,037
Speaker 1: like the house will have one version of a bill and then the Senate will have a different version of the same bill and They vote on them separately and then they go to this conference committee Which mixes them together.

630
00:45:46,057 --> 00:45:56,308
Speaker 1: it like if they pass both houses the two different laws Two different bills in both houses then they go to a conference committee and they mix them together to get the same one And then they vote on them again.

631
00:45:57,072 --> 00:46:00,062
Speaker 0: It's really kind of silly and I just did.

632
00:46:00,262 --> 00:46:02,570
Speaker 0: this is one of the things that bothers me in general about the world.

633
00:46:02,631 --> 00:46:04,309
Speaker 0: Is that there are solutions?

634
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:22,870
Speaker 0: relatively simple solutions to Long-standing problems with society culture technology everything and for various reasons the people who have Much to gain or actually in this case possibly much to lose A lot of their you know shortcuts and tricks and shenanigans.

635
00:46:23,713 --> 00:46:25,979
Speaker 0: These solutions aren't adopted aren't even looked at.

636
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:29,249
Speaker 0: the people who have the problems don't even understand that these solutions exist.

637
00:46:30,012 --> 00:46:31,797
Speaker 1: People don't understand technology.

638
00:46:31,817 --> 00:46:34,163
Speaker 1: So any technology solutions, they're not even gonna.

639
00:46:34,644 --> 00:46:44,790
Speaker 1: it's like there are people who like it's sort of like regular expressions like people will be editing some file and they'll need to like Find and replace something or they need to do something clever and you know what they'll do.

640
00:46:44,830 --> 00:46:52,290
Speaker 1: they'll copy and they'll go paste paste paste paste paste paste paste and then they'll edit every single line by hand and that they Won't even realize they'll be like that's just the way it's done.

641
00:46:52,330 --> 00:47:03,910
Speaker 0: They won't even think if only there was a way that this could be done easier If there is a way if only there was some sort of machine that could do large numbers of menial calculations over and over again as fast as possible.

642
00:47:04,865 --> 00:47:15,843
Speaker 1: if Yeah, it's like people don't even know they have the problems to even think if like if there was a solution now There is there are solutions to problems that you have that you don't know you have.

643
00:47:16,184 --> 00:47:28,870
Speaker 0: obviously the Congress example is Somewhat more complicated than we might have made it out to be but the fact remains that well one We've thought about this a lot and I could go into great detail as to the more specific ideas have I have regarding that.

644
00:47:29,050 --> 00:47:37,724
Speaker 0: Yep, but in general, I think the idea stands that there are problems that can be solved trivially by technology That are not solved by technology for no good reason.

645
00:47:38,387 --> 00:47:42,942
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Alright, you want to talk about some specific version control type topic?

646
00:47:43,022 --> 00:47:49,945
Speaker 0: Alright, well very I'd like to talk about forking because a lot Of people don't seem to know what forking means and it's kind of related or branching.

647
00:47:50,929 --> 00:47:51,772
Speaker 1: Ah Hmm.

648
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:58,070
Speaker 0: Alright, so let's say I'm working on my how to cook a goat thing and Scott's working on it with me.

649
00:47:58,170 --> 00:48:02,730
Speaker 0: And we get to version 2.1 and everything's going fine and suddenly Scott says, you know what?

650
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:04,870
Speaker 0: We're going about this all wrong.

651
00:48:05,010 --> 00:48:14,227
Speaker 0: you're supposed to cook goats on grills and we've been talking about cooking them in ovens and I'm done with this business and I'm Gonna write my own guide and I'm gonna take all the data we got and do my own thing.

652
00:48:14,247 --> 00:48:16,156
Speaker 0: and I say, you know What screw your idea?

653
00:48:16,458 --> 00:48:18,266
Speaker 0: I'm sticking with what we've got now.

654
00:48:18,306 --> 00:48:19,070
Speaker 0: We've got a problem.

655
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:24,150
Speaker 0: We've got one document and two different philosophies as to where to go forward from here.

656
00:48:24,383 --> 00:48:28,246
Speaker 1: No We could just keep making versions where we go back and forth and back and forth and back before.

657
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:29,190
Speaker 1: that is silly.

658
00:48:29,411 --> 00:48:30,273
Speaker 1: That is very silly.

659
00:48:30,293 --> 00:48:31,797
Speaker 0: that happens on Wikipedia often.

660
00:48:31,837 --> 00:48:33,642
Speaker 0: luckily they're safeguards to stop that.

661
00:48:33,862 --> 00:48:34,344
Speaker 1: luckily.

662
00:48:34,424 --> 00:48:36,269
Speaker 0: Yes, luckily he died.

663
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:43,150
Speaker 1: Forks or when you break off and you split it two ways or possibly more than two ways.

664
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,670
Speaker 1: So now we've got the oven methodology fork and the grill methodology fork.

665
00:48:47,730 --> 00:48:54,290
Speaker 1: So I've started a whole new chain of updates going that way and rim has started a whole new chain of updates going that way.

666
00:48:54,451 --> 00:48:58,830
Speaker 0: It's kind of like evolution where two species break off from a common ancestor species.

667
00:48:59,693 --> 00:49:01,309
Speaker 1: That's pretty much exactly what it's like.

668
00:49:01,390 --> 00:49:15,393
Speaker 1: Yeah and you'll often see people talking about forks when in open source projects like when x free 86. right They x free 86 was the x server that people used on Unix and Linux systems and to make the GUI show up And it's still what they use.

669
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:20,490
Speaker 1: However, people used to use x free 86. now people use xorg.

670
00:49:20,952 --> 00:49:25,470
Speaker 1: What happened was at a certain point the people who do x free 86?

671
00:49:25,470 --> 00:49:30,649
Speaker 1: Made some stupid changes to their license and they did some stuff that no one liked And people are very upset with them.

672
00:49:31,071 --> 00:49:40,845
Speaker 1: So they went to the previous version of x free 86 before the bullshit happened and they forked it and do a new thing Called x org which now you pretty much should be using.

673
00:49:40,885 --> 00:49:45,026
Speaker 1: you don't really want to be using No one's using x free 86 anymore, except people with old computers.

674
00:49:45,066 --> 00:49:45,910
Speaker 1: They can't be updated.

675
00:49:46,573 --> 00:49:50,620
Speaker 1: but X free 86 continued along its merry stupid way.

676
00:49:50,781 --> 00:49:51,222
Speaker 1: At least I'm.

677
00:49:51,503 --> 00:49:52,828
Speaker 1: I don't know is it still continuing.

678
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:53,570
Speaker 0: I've never looked.

679
00:49:53,671 --> 00:49:55,262
Speaker 1: I don't even know if anyone's still working on it.

680
00:49:55,323 --> 00:49:56,270
Speaker 1: That's how much it died.

681
00:49:56,691 --> 00:50:02,670
Speaker 1: But the fork of x free 86 x org is going along quite nicely and it is the very awesome.

682
00:50:03,091 --> 00:50:07,325
Speaker 0: So now if you ever wondered what people like us mean when we say hey blah blah blah.

683
00:50:07,345 --> 00:50:08,609
Speaker 0: He forked the Linux kernel.

684
00:50:08,670 --> 00:50:09,412
Speaker 0: now That's that's it.

685
00:50:09,472 --> 00:50:10,134
Speaker 0: That's all it is.

686
00:50:10,214 --> 00:50:15,670
Speaker 0: you fork off into two separate paths going in usually separate directions or at least different directions.

687
00:50:16,272 --> 00:50:16,432
Speaker 1: Yep.

688
00:50:16,974 --> 00:50:18,177
Speaker 1: Now here's a funny one.

689
00:50:18,598 --> 00:50:22,550
Speaker 1: There is a fork of CVS the concurrent very the.

690
00:50:23,272 --> 00:50:23,853
Speaker 1: What's a CVS?

691
00:50:23,914 --> 00:50:26,501
Speaker 1: it's like concurrent version system something like that.

692
00:50:26,541 --> 00:50:28,988
Speaker 1: I don't actually remember current version control system.

693
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:32,840
Speaker 0: I'm not even sure It's one of those things that you use so often.

694
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:35,790
Speaker 0: You never really care what the accurate current versioning system.

695
00:50:36,232 --> 00:50:38,423
Speaker 0: Maybe we have the internet at our disposal.

696
00:50:38,624 --> 00:50:39,870
Speaker 1: I know but I closed my laptop.

697
00:50:40,312 --> 00:50:48,130
Speaker 1: Ah, but anyway, there's a fork of CVS itself Which is quite ironic called subversion and the main difference there.

698
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:56,290
Speaker 1: There are a lot of differences and you know Basically, it's not like we just talked about where xorg was great and x free 86 sucked and everyone uses xorgs.

699
00:50:56,330 --> 00:51:01,490
Speaker 1: Now people still use CVS and people use subversion because they're both good in their own way.

700
00:51:01,731 --> 00:51:06,687
Speaker 1: That is different philosophies on versioning control concurrent versions system.

701
00:51:07,008 --> 00:51:07,550
Speaker 1: I was close.

702
00:51:08,191 --> 00:51:09,995
Speaker 1: Anyway, the difference between.

703
00:51:10,055 --> 00:51:17,592
Speaker 1: the main difference between CVS and subversion is that CVS has every single file in a repository Is separate.

704
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:25,212
Speaker 1: so let's say I'm working on a book with rim and we put each chapter in a separate document and I edit one Chapter.

705
00:51:25,432 --> 00:51:29,143
Speaker 1: that you then with the first version was point one and I edit one chapter.

706
00:51:29,504 --> 00:51:35,001
Speaker 1: now that chapter is version point two And all the other chapters are still point one because they haven't been.

707
00:51:35,021 --> 00:51:36,245
Speaker 1: they're still on their first version.

708
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:37,710
Speaker 1: That's how CVS works.

709
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:44,397
Speaker 1: so in CVS every single file is gonna have a current version and That's that's good for a lot of things.

710
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:47,147
Speaker 1: sometimes you want to have every different file have a different version.

711
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:51,286
Speaker 1: in Subversion you have what is called atomic commits.

712
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:52,070
Speaker 1: where?

713
00:51:52,830 --> 00:51:56,170
Speaker 1: Every single file goes with the same version.

714
00:51:56,270 --> 00:52:00,489
Speaker 1: So let's say we're working on like we put the initial version of the book in there.

715
00:52:00,932 --> 00:52:03,105
Speaker 1: Then I edit one chapter and I commit.

716
00:52:03,488 --> 00:52:06,839
Speaker 1: now Even if those other chapters aren't updated they got it.

717
00:52:07,180 --> 00:52:09,747
Speaker 1: the next version of the chapter is exactly that.

718
00:52:09,868 --> 00:52:10,670
Speaker 1: it makes a new version.

719
00:52:10,831 --> 00:52:13,442
Speaker 1: So point two there's a new version of the other chapters.

720
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:15,130
Speaker 1: They're just the same as the older version.

721
00:52:16,011 --> 00:52:19,461
Speaker 1: This is good for software for a lot of reasons.

722
00:52:19,742 --> 00:52:22,710
Speaker 1: For example, I'm working on a software project, right?

723
00:52:22,790 --> 00:52:25,969
Speaker 1: I make some changes to one source file and another source file.

724
00:52:26,752 --> 00:52:32,470
Speaker 1: If you don't have the right versions of every source file the program probably won't work, you know.

725
00:52:32,570 --> 00:52:37,985
Speaker 1: So, how do you know if you need like version 1.5 of this and 1.7 of that and 2.3 of that in order to make?

726
00:52:39,731 --> 00:52:40,096
Speaker 1: It work.

727
00:52:40,421 --> 00:52:40,806
Speaker 0: It's tough.

728
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:46,467
Speaker 0: Yep Now you can't control the version numbers of external programs or external libraries or external sources.

729
00:52:46,487 --> 00:52:55,930
Speaker 0: You happen to be using But at the same time you can at least control all the things that you were working on To be the same version to make it at least a little bit easier.

730
00:52:56,110 --> 00:52:56,291
Speaker 0: Yep,

731
00:52:56,492 --> 00:53:14,410
Speaker 1: so with subversion if someone's doing software with subversion and you only commit when the software works You know that whatever version you check out of subversion You're gonna get something that probably works and not you know This version of that file and this version of that file in order to go to the previous version of the software.

732
00:53:14,832 --> 00:53:24,169
Speaker 1: so for certain types of projects the atomic commits of subversion are pretty awesome and For certain other kinds of things the non atomic commits of CVS are awesome.

733
00:53:24,350 --> 00:53:33,512
Speaker 1: So you gotta you know choose which one you like sometimes depending on your philosophy Maybe choose the one that's better for whatever project you're working on Etc.

734
00:53:33,994 --> 00:53:35,097
Speaker 1: now, here's something really cool.

735
00:53:35,118 --> 00:53:38,590
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's called a tinderbox, but I'm not a hundred percent sure.

736
00:53:38,831 --> 00:53:40,862
Speaker 1: And basically what a tinderbox does?

737
00:53:40,963 --> 00:53:42,250
Speaker 1: it's a specific software tool.

738
00:53:42,734 --> 00:53:44,390
Speaker 1: You have a version control system.

739
00:53:44,952 --> 00:53:52,198
Speaker 1: the tinderbox will look at the latest version of the software in the version control system and Make sure that it works.

740
00:53:52,841 --> 00:53:54,330
Speaker 1: sort of it'll run some tests on it.

741
00:53:54,330 --> 00:53:55,414
Speaker 1: You know, does it compile?

742
00:53:55,655 --> 00:53:57,864
Speaker 1: does it run without core dumping whatever?

743
00:53:58,326 --> 00:54:04,464
Speaker 1: and if it you know Breaks the software by committing say something with a syntax error the tinderbox will go.

744
00:54:04,484 --> 00:54:06,489
Speaker 1: Oh fucks someone messed up.

745
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:08,637
Speaker 1: So now you know that.

746
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:11,950
Speaker 1: oh, you know who messed up because you can see who committed the change.

747
00:54:12,412 --> 00:54:13,797
Speaker 0: You can see what version.

748
00:54:14,078 --> 00:54:16,830
Speaker 1: you can go back to the previous version that you know that works.

749
00:54:17,292 --> 00:54:28,849
Speaker 1: You can go and look at the difference between the broken version and the previous version You know is working and see where they screwed up and then you can get the tinderbox to turn green again And then people can get back to work because they know they won't screw it up.

750
00:54:29,110 --> 00:54:39,809
Speaker 1: Huh, and this helps you develop software not only with all the advantages of version control But keeping a working product the whole time and never, you know, totally screwing up all the code.

751
00:54:39,829 --> 00:54:41,121
Speaker 1: now You don't know where the problem is.

752
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:41,969
Speaker 1: That's making it not go.

753
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:43,171
Speaker 0: now.

754
00:54:43,191 --> 00:54:56,910
Speaker 0: just in general the best thing about something like CVS is that from my standpoint as a guy who would maintain the server but Has nothing to do with the code because I the code I write is dubious at best and usually relegated to the script category.

755
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,739
Speaker 0: I'm an IT guy, but I've managed CVS servers.

756
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:04,290
Speaker 0: It's so trivial to take care of a CVS server.

757
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:06,770
Speaker 1: You just kind of turn it on and let people set the permission.

758
00:55:06,871 --> 00:55:09,082
Speaker 0: We got to turn it on until you get a back up the data.

759
00:55:09,383 --> 00:55:11,379
Speaker 1: Oh backing up the so important Yeah, but that's it.

760
00:55:11,439 --> 00:55:12,189
Speaker 0: That's all you got to do.

761
00:55:12,615 --> 00:55:14,976
Speaker 0: I mean if it breaks It's not gonna break.

762
00:55:15,016 --> 00:55:17,084
Speaker 0: the server is gonna break before CVS is gonna break.

763
00:55:17,104 --> 00:55:18,470
Speaker 0: CVS is pretty tried and true.

764
00:55:18,851 --> 00:55:26,151
Speaker 1: It's real old and even subversion which is much newer than CVS is tried and true and you can totally trust it for whatever You're doing.

765
00:55:26,633 --> 00:55:30,084
Speaker 1: there are other ones like git which is the one I think that I'm pretty sure.

766
00:55:30,124 --> 00:55:34,643
Speaker 1: Linus Torvalds developed it when he stopped Using bitkeeper because bitkeeper did something weird.

767
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,150
Speaker 1: There's a whole story about that.

768
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,922
Speaker 1: You can go research it on the internet if you want.

769
00:55:38,023 --> 00:55:39,030
Speaker 0: You probably don't care.

770
00:55:39,030 --> 00:55:42,610
Speaker 0: In fact, I'll bet that we've already gone into more technical depth than any of you care about.

771
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,050
Speaker 1: There's not really much more to say that isn't technically deep.

772
00:55:45,090 --> 00:55:49,550
Speaker 1: Well here let's think of some interesting uses for version control systems that are out of the ordinary.

773
00:55:50,012 --> 00:55:50,494
Speaker 1: I got one.

774
00:55:50,875 --> 00:55:57,009
Speaker 1: the one that I say is if you've got say my documents folder Put the whole thing in a version control system.

775
00:55:57,951 --> 00:55:58,877
Speaker 1: Then you got.

776
00:55:58,898 --> 00:56:07,410
Speaker 1: you got a backup because it's you know Hopefully on some other server somewhere and if you ever change any of your documents Well now you can go back and get old versions.

777
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:12,133
Speaker 1: You can see what your my documents folder was like in 2003 or 2002.

778
00:56:12,133 --> 00:56:14,121
Speaker 1: You can see what your my documents folder is like today.

779
00:56:14,141 --> 00:56:20,956
Speaker 1: if you have Multiple computers and your version control system is on a server You can be at home.

780
00:56:21,498 --> 00:56:27,590
Speaker 1: check out your my documents folder make some changes check them in Go to work check out your new my documents folder.

781
00:56:28,094 --> 00:56:33,162
Speaker 1: So it's sort of like your stuff is stored on a server But you can kind of mix and match the versions.

782
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:35,130
Speaker 1: work on something at home work at something at work.

783
00:56:35,250 --> 00:56:35,491
Speaker 1: I did.

784
00:56:35,531 --> 00:56:42,010
Speaker 0: you could do that almost as easily with roaming profiles or remote home directory or all that sort of a lot.

785
00:56:42,291 --> 00:56:46,283
Speaker 1: I know a lot of scary people who put their whole home directories in CVS.

786
00:56:46,764 --> 00:56:47,186
Speaker 0: Wow.

787
00:56:47,587 --> 00:56:55,640
Speaker 1: I wouldn't recommend that I'll put my home directory on a separate hard drive mounted, but I put my Configuration files for my computer in CVS.

788
00:56:55,681 --> 00:56:57,507
Speaker 1: that way you go to a new computer.

789
00:56:57,567 --> 00:56:59,176
Speaker 1: you want to set it up Just like the one at home.

790
00:56:59,317 --> 00:57:00,605
Speaker 1: Check out all the configuration files.

791
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:00,927
Speaker 1: You're done.

792
00:57:00,947 --> 00:57:10,829
Speaker 0: Yep I actually did that for a DNS DHCP server combo when I was an RIT working in labs because it was just BAM And I had it there exactly the way I wanted it.

793
00:57:10,970 --> 00:57:20,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then say one day one of your settings is bothering you so you change it on one machine Yep, then it's changed on all your other machines because you check out the same settings from the same repository.

794
00:57:20,952 --> 00:57:34,298
Speaker 0: Also, I'd recommend anyone learning about computers do this sort of thing because even if you don't need the version control It's something you should know about and unlike a lot of other things that you should know about on the internet and with computers It's really easy to learn how to use CVS.

795
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,244
Speaker 0: Like I'm not kidding.

796
00:57:36,264 --> 00:57:38,090
Speaker 1: There's basically three commands.

797
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:45,327
Speaker 1: There's a lot of advanced commands like the command to fork is a little complicated But the basic commands of check in check out update a real simple.

798
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:51,683
Speaker 0: Yes I mean, we're not just saying this as two guys who are technologically proficient seriously Mm-hmm.

799
00:57:52,192 --> 00:57:58,790
Speaker 1: The one last thing you're gonna want to learn CVS or subversion for is that there's a lot of open source software out there that you know.

800
00:57:58,971 --> 00:58:01,381
Speaker 1: You want to get the newest newest newest version.

801
00:58:01,401 --> 00:58:06,639
Speaker 1: and of course the open source people, you know They have people around the world working on one piece of software.

802
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:07,461
Speaker 1: Guess what?

803
00:58:07,522 --> 00:58:10,290
Speaker 1: They keep all that source code in a CVS or subversion.

804
00:58:10,451 --> 00:58:12,609
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean, let's say you're using redhead or whatever.

805
00:58:12,931 --> 00:58:20,800
Speaker 0: You have to wait for the people doing the project or their friends to make your RPM file Which is probably a few little tiny versions behind.

806
00:58:20,921 --> 00:58:21,904
Speaker 0: maybe it comes out late.

807
00:58:22,225 --> 00:58:23,590
Speaker 0: Maybe you need the newest version now.

808
00:58:23,952 --> 00:58:27,010
Speaker 1: Maybe you want to try out, you know the version that people are working on.

809
00:58:27,090 --> 00:58:30,190
Speaker 1: Maybe you want to work on the newest version of an open source project.

810
00:58:30,210 --> 00:58:35,849
Speaker 0: You're probably gonna have to go into CVS to get it because they're not gonna make binaries of every little release just for you

811
00:58:36,371 --> 00:58:51,251
Speaker 1: yes, and you can also a lot of times get a much newer version of Software then is easily available By going through the slight trouble of checking out the absolute up-to-the-minute newest version of the source code from CVS and then compiling it Yourself,

812
00:58:51,332 --> 00:58:56,510
Speaker 0: I mean even gen 2 which generally has very up-to-date sources in its update tree.

813
00:58:57,293 --> 00:59:00,909
Speaker 0: There are times when there will be stuff you want that for whatever reason isn't in there.

814
00:59:01,573 --> 00:59:05,050
Speaker 0: Even then granted many of you aren't even gonna ever use gen 2 so it doesn't matter.

815
00:59:05,451 --> 00:59:12,887
Speaker 0: But CVS is usually the way to get the bleeding is bleeding ist edge of any given software Because people are working on it.

816
00:59:13,210 --> 00:59:20,743
Speaker 1: Like if a guy was working on something five minutes ago, and he submits his updates You can grab those and take advantage of those new feature.

817
00:59:20,763 --> 00:59:22,510
Speaker 1: He just coded five minutes ago.

818
00:59:22,650 --> 00:59:32,566
Speaker 0: this is especially great when you've got new hardware or new something and Support for that new something is in the newest newest newest alpha alpha alpha stage of some program that you need.

819
00:59:33,308 --> 00:59:50,785
Speaker 1: or say if You have a piece of software that you rely heavily on But it's still in super development or there's a lot of people working on it But it's not quite there yet like a lot of people will check out the newest versions of Firefox from CVS's or get the nightly builds and stuff like that.

820
00:59:50,826 --> 00:59:59,614
Speaker 1: just to get you know The Firefox 3 features before Firefox 3 comes out even though it's sort of unstable and still being worked on you can get it It's there.

821
01:00:00,157 --> 01:00:02,610
Speaker 0: so I suppose that's that even though it's not the night for it.

822
01:00:02,871 --> 01:00:09,650
Speaker 0: I would like to point out that we have contests running both Wednesday night and Thursday night and the deadlines are Wednesday and Thursday.

823
01:00:10,415 --> 01:00:11,643
Speaker 0: Oh, this is the final week.

824
01:00:11,804 --> 01:00:12,710
Speaker 0: I'm gonna remind everyone.

825
01:00:12,810 --> 01:00:21,450
Speaker 0: I think I'll extend the deadline one day because one person on one of the contests said they had a good entry and they emailed Me personally, so I might accept a few late.

826
01:00:21,874 --> 01:00:23,630
Speaker 0: But we've gotten some pretty good entries on both.

827
01:00:23,772 --> 01:00:25,128
Speaker 0: So I'm not too worried here.

828
01:00:25,754 --> 01:00:31,507
Speaker 1: And if you want to enter those you're gonna have to listen on Wednesday or Thursday because we're not gonna tell you what they are right now.

829
01:00:31,667 --> 01:00:41,442
Speaker 0: Oh knows This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

830
01:00:41,462 --> 01:00:43,590
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music.
