1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:10,705
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, March 8th.

2
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:11,406
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

3
00:00:11,667 --> 00:00:12,128
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

4
00:00:12,268 --> 00:00:13,892
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:13,972 --> 00:00:17,600
Speaker 0: Tonight, the board game, Tales of the Arabian Nights.

6
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:22,908
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:33,449
Speaker 0: So we've already talked on this show about the game of the year 2010 Pac-Man Championship Edition DX.

8
00:00:33,529 --> 00:00:33,910
Speaker 0: We have.

9
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:42,107
Speaker 0: However, I must inform everybody that I am ranked number 214 in the world.

10
00:00:42,248 --> 00:00:42,771
Speaker 1: Out of 240.

11
00:00:42,771 --> 00:00:46,827
Speaker 0: No, out of like over a hundred thousand a lot.

12
00:00:46,847 --> 00:00:50,626
Speaker 0: I don't know if it's a hundred thousand It's a fuck ton of players thousands and thousands of players.

13
00:00:50,646 --> 00:00:51,510
Speaker 0: I'm number 214.

14
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,017
Speaker 1: That is pretty damn impressive.

15
00:00:54,037 --> 00:00:59,777
Speaker 0: It's actually less than that because there are like a few very few players at the very very top that are all cheaters.

16
00:00:59,797 --> 00:01:10,690
Speaker 0: because if you go and look at the leaderboards You'll see that like there's like five or six guys like less than ten But their scores are pretty much at the limit of the score field and it's like yeah, they they definitely cheated.

17
00:01:10,851 --> 00:01:11,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no way they didn't.

18
00:01:11,936 --> 00:01:13,664
Speaker 0: There's no way that that was a legitimate score.

19
00:01:13,905 --> 00:01:14,810
Speaker 0: Like some of them have you know?

20
00:01:16,012 --> 00:01:23,784
Speaker 0: It's usually the thing is it's only on certain like scored Courses that they actually have these cheating times and whatever.

21
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:27,490
Speaker 0: on the time trials It seems like all the times are actually legitimate.

22
00:01:27,992 --> 00:01:32,290
Speaker 0: The thing is basically what happened is I just kept playing and playing and my skill improved, right?

23
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:36,970
Speaker 0: And what happened is just there's so many courses and so many different, you know things you have to score on.

24
00:01:37,451 --> 00:01:44,718
Speaker 0: I just kept playing all of them, you know, I kept cycling through them and every time I cycled through, you know It's like my score would it just?

25
00:01:44,919 --> 00:01:47,129
Speaker 0: it just took time for it to jump up because it's like.

26
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,590
Speaker 0: well I haven't done the junction in a while.

27
00:01:49,712 --> 00:01:50,470
Speaker 1: That's what I was finding.

28
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:50,791
Speaker 1: so

29
00:01:50,811 --> 00:01:52,256
Speaker 0: I do the junction again and I

30
00:01:52,276 --> 00:01:52,838
Speaker 1: was playing

31
00:01:52,959 --> 00:01:54,705
Speaker 0: all my old junctions by a whole bunch

32
00:01:54,825 --> 00:02:01,690
Speaker 1: when I was playing the game regularly just In the course of actually doing the time trial on what I hadn't done before my rank would jump like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds.

33
00:02:01,919 --> 00:02:02,110
Speaker 0: Yep.

34
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:10,277
Speaker 0: But now I've pretty much sort of hit this limit where I've sort of done everything and I'm it's very very difficult for me to Beat any of my own stuff now.

35
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,270
Speaker 1: It's very frustrating to play a time trial of something You've already pretty much mastered.

36
00:02:14,692 --> 00:02:23,177
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is I look at the leaderboard for that time trial and I'm only like this one time trial on highway Which is one of my best courses But for some reason my time.

37
00:02:23,217 --> 00:02:27,590
Speaker 0: trial on highway is shit and I can't figure out like any way to make it go faster.

38
00:02:27,812 --> 00:02:32,407
Speaker 1: See if you're off by a little bit Then it could just be a matter of perfect execution like getting sparks in every corner.

39
00:02:32,528 --> 00:02:35,454
Speaker 0: No I'm off by a lot.

40
00:02:35,494 --> 00:02:37,020
Speaker 0: I can't figure out but I can't like I've.

41
00:02:37,101 --> 00:02:39,430
Speaker 1: it means there's an alternate path that you should be.

42
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,359
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I can't find the alternate path.

43
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,646
Speaker 0: Maybe you know, you want to help me out.

44
00:02:43,088 --> 00:02:43,349
Speaker 1: I don't know.

45
00:02:43,512 --> 00:02:51,607
Speaker 1: I mean I actually I feel like I should start playing again cuz I played the game a whole bunch now but like Scott I were Neck-and-neck for a while and I just stopped playing and Scott.

46
00:02:51,627 --> 00:02:52,310
Speaker 1: Scott kept playing.

47
00:02:52,873 --> 00:02:54,942
Speaker 1: And now I think Scott is way better than me and I gotta catch up.

48
00:02:55,404 --> 00:03:00,138
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's gonna be a Tournament for it at PAX But it's pretty I don't like really.

49
00:03:00,158 --> 00:03:03,150
Speaker 0: the format of the tournament is kind of lame and also it's at a bad time.

50
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,336
Speaker 0: I already have a scheduled thing.

51
00:03:04,557 --> 00:03:07,390
Speaker 1: if I were doing the tournament at PAX the way I would do it is alright.

52
00:03:07,653 --> 00:03:08,969
Speaker 1: So you've got a hundred entries.

53
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,595
Speaker 1: Make sure you've got a hundred.

54
00:03:10,695 --> 00:03:12,701
Speaker 1: Xbox is ready to go or maybe 50 bright.

55
00:03:12,721 --> 00:03:15,510
Speaker 1: break it down into big groups and have everybody go.

56
00:03:15,891 --> 00:03:18,281
Speaker 0: They only have like I think it's max like 30 something entries.

57
00:03:18,321 --> 00:03:18,883
Speaker 0: It's not many.

58
00:03:19,245 --> 00:03:19,687
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

59
00:03:19,707 --> 00:03:22,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course The game isn't that popular actually.

60
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,241
Speaker 0: Well, the way they're doing it is pretty much.

61
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:29,710
Speaker 0: you get to play Championship 2 So the default course and the 5-minute time a score mode the fault course.

62
00:03:29,832 --> 00:03:31,010
Speaker 1: I kick the shit out of that right.

63
00:03:31,392 --> 00:03:36,013
Speaker 0: So you have to basically what you do is you go and you sit next to someone and you get one try Right.

64
00:03:36,113 --> 00:03:40,130
Speaker 0: or you know and one try means either the full five minutes or you die.

65
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:43,706
Speaker 1: Right that actually is important because one thing I've noticed I never die.

66
00:03:44,007 --> 00:03:44,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never die.

67
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:51,250
Speaker 1: The dying is crazy, but playing the game Because we were both going for the high scores any time I made a mistake at all.

68
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,937
Speaker 1: I just reflexively restart.

69
00:03:53,097 --> 00:03:56,250
Speaker 0: Yep, even if you reflexively restart at the tournament, you're just done.

70
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:57,330
Speaker 0: They'll mark your score or whatever.

71
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,295
Speaker 0: It was when you restarted.

72
00:03:58,416 --> 00:04:03,190
Speaker 1: even if I'm three minutes into a five-minute run if I make a mistake I just start over because I know now that my run is used.

73
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:11,585
Speaker 0: Here's my strategy if I if I am in the tournament, which is not looking likely, but if it does happen Anytime that I would have restarted.

74
00:04:11,706 --> 00:04:14,176
Speaker 0: pause Because you pause when you.

75
00:04:14,197 --> 00:04:16,225
Speaker 0: basically you would restart when you're about to die, right?

76
00:04:16,526 --> 00:04:17,510
Speaker 0: So instead pause.

77
00:04:18,172 --> 00:04:22,327
Speaker 1: Take a look around you and try to figure out when I'm allowed to die if I'm about to die at bomb.

78
00:04:22,648 --> 00:04:27,230
Speaker 1: if I if I Restart is because like I missed a turn Yeah, or something like that.

79
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:31,577
Speaker 0: What I would do is I would just because I because I'm not allowed to restart in the tournament It would basically just fuck me over.

80
00:04:31,597 --> 00:04:36,850
Speaker 0: I would pause and say okay Where am I now that I fucked up and figure out the optimal escape?

81
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:40,302
Speaker 0: You know be a bomb or whatever and then you know go for will they?

82
00:04:40,342 --> 00:04:40,924
Speaker 1: let you pause?

83
00:04:40,964 --> 00:04:41,807
Speaker 1: many tournaments don't?

84
00:04:41,928 --> 00:04:43,697
Speaker 0: there's no way they Can't not let you pause.

85
00:04:43,838 --> 00:04:44,744
Speaker 1: I wouldn't let people pause.

86
00:04:44,764 --> 00:04:45,630
Speaker 0: You got to be able to pause.

87
00:04:45,832 --> 00:04:46,337
Speaker 1: I would argue.

88
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,644
Speaker 1: if I were running a tournament One of the rules would be you cannot pause the game.

89
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:52,030
Speaker 0: if you do you immediately lose.

90
00:04:52,652 --> 00:04:53,837
Speaker 0: I would say pausing is allowed.

91
00:04:53,878 --> 00:04:55,424
Speaker 1: Anyway, I wouldn't let pausing happen.

92
00:04:55,465 --> 00:05:01,501
Speaker 1: I would ask about pausing But anyway, you should have tweeted Robert cool about pausing Anyway.

93
00:05:02,952 --> 00:05:05,310
Speaker 0: So the thing is if I was in the tournament, right?

94
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,902
Speaker 0: It's like it was you go to championship - and yeah I had a five-minute score attack.

95
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:14,808
Speaker 0: you get one try Against one other person and whichever one of you gets the better score on that playthrough, right?

96
00:05:15,771 --> 00:05:16,916
Speaker 0: Moves forward in the back now.

97
00:05:17,338 --> 00:05:26,170
Speaker 1: The reason I bring up that whole restarting thing is that even if you don't restart People who play the game for the high score get into a mode where they're always going for the perfect run.

98
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,699
Speaker 1: They very rarely play the degenerated game.

99
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:35,320
Speaker 1: the I messed up have to keep going mode Which is actually important in a tournament where you're only playing once.

100
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,090
Speaker 1: because now it's not just what is your optimal play?

101
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:40,270
Speaker 1: It is also what is your average play?

102
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,390
Speaker 1: Like if you fuck up you have to deal with that now like you have to do this one shot.

103
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,674
Speaker 1: It's how consistent you.

104
00:05:45,714 --> 00:05:53,990
Speaker 0: however in the final round when there's only two people left you get two shots and they take your better score Of the two tries, but you still have to make the most of each try.

105
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:55,356
Speaker 0: You can't bail on either one.

106
00:05:55,376 --> 00:05:57,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, because you know you like oh, it's the first try.

107
00:05:57,948 --> 00:05:58,450
Speaker 0: I screwed up.

108
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,810
Speaker 0: I'll just throw this try out and do the next one perfectly.

109
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:07,707
Speaker 0: Well, what if you fuck up the next one - it's like you got to use the maximum Score that you're gonna get on either.

110
00:06:07,748 --> 00:06:12,286
Speaker 1: try Races are like that like you when you have a ski team and you do races a lot of times.

111
00:06:12,306 --> 00:06:14,638
Speaker 1: the way it's formatted is you have like say five team members.

112
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,781
Speaker 1: they all get to do the course and If you fall like you you basically don't qualify.

113
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:20,263
Speaker 1: like you don't?

114
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:20,806
Speaker 1: it doesn't count.

115
00:06:20,846 --> 00:06:30,169
Speaker 1: like you don't get any score You basically you get an X like nothing Whoa, but you would need say three scores for the like how your team was ranked at the end.

116
00:06:30,652 --> 00:06:36,988
Speaker 1: So if you have five guys - the scores won't count So you'll have your really good guys go first and you'll have them push it.

117
00:06:37,712 --> 00:06:40,266
Speaker 1: Because if they fuck up you have the lame guys.

118
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:41,030
Speaker 1: who can you know?

119
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:47,790
Speaker 1: Just do this the course Okay, and get at least a score as opposed to usually like in a relay race you would do the opposite, right?

120
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,109
Speaker 0: You have the crappy guys go first and you have the best guy at the end who can make up for.

121
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:59,229
Speaker 0: you know How much time was lost, you know as opposed to having your best guy go first and then you know If someone else is ahead of you at the end.

122
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:03,390
Speaker 1: Well, you got no chance or what you do is put the best guys last but their dictum is alright.

123
00:07:03,390 --> 00:07:08,310
Speaker 1: If the the not as good guys got like they passed they didn't fail.

124
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,075
Speaker 1: They made it to the end.

125
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,228
Speaker 1: They got okay times and all of them made it.

126
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:16,490
Speaker 1: Then you can really push it because if you fuck up and don't get a score at least everyone else got a score.

127
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:26,329
Speaker 1: But if say you're the last guy You're the best guy and three of your teammates fucked up and got no score You now know that you have to play the conservative route and just get a score no matter what it is.

128
00:07:26,553 --> 00:07:32,367
Speaker 0: But yeah The tournament is pretty much all championship to five minute which is kind of like because I've pretty much.

129
00:07:32,427 --> 00:07:44,815
Speaker 0: the reason my rank is So high I think is because if you actually look it seems like a lot of people don't play all the courses And I've actually gone through and played every mode on every course to the maximum of my ability and because of that That's

130
00:07:44,855 --> 00:07:45,822
Speaker 1: hard to say.

131
00:07:45,862 --> 00:07:46,990
Speaker 0: that is what has pushed my rank.

132
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:52,150
Speaker 1: So but thus it's hard to say how good you actually are at that course or overall because people are no good.

133
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,727
Speaker 0: There's also individual course rank.

134
00:07:53,808 --> 00:07:54,545
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I'm in the top.

135
00:07:54,831 --> 00:08:04,090
Speaker 1: I'm in the top like hundreds of every course, but I think people who are really good at the game Some of them might actually they should be ranked higher, but they're not because they just never played one of the courses.

136
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:16,690
Speaker 0: That's quite possible that there are people who are perhaps like excellent at one course Like maybe there's a guy who mastered championship - this doesn't play any other courses at all You know, but so the thing is I have individual course ranks and you can you can see those as well.

137
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:19,210
Speaker 1: So I guess you have to decide are you going to enter the tournament or not?

138
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,556
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think so.

139
00:08:20,576 --> 00:08:27,927
Speaker 0: Yeah, the timing is looking bad, but it's not Prove anything because my rank is public on the leaderboards.

140
00:08:28,168 --> 00:08:32,030
Speaker 1: So whatever I have mixed feelings about tournaments at conventions in general even packs.

141
00:08:32,631 --> 00:08:35,741
Speaker 0: I feel like at least packs gives you sweet medals if you they do.

142
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:51,186
Speaker 1: but every con I've ever been to except Magfest the Tournaments they have in video gaming tend to be kind of not very glamorous kind of poorly run or if they're well run They're just not that fun and there's no spectator component by it by and large

143
00:08:51,407 --> 00:08:52,190
Speaker 0: except the Omega thon.

144
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Omega thon separate though.

145
00:08:53,594 --> 00:08:54,598
Speaker 1: That's a special event.

146
00:08:55,079 --> 00:08:58,310
Speaker 0: My major problem with them is that they just take a lot of time.

147
00:08:59,192 --> 00:09:01,420
Speaker 1: But that's because they're designed to do that.

148
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,290
Speaker 1: you could design them differently to where they wouldn't take up as much time.

149
00:09:04,330 --> 00:09:13,195
Speaker 0: it is a serious time investment to go and be in the tournament and you know, the Cost-benefit ratio doesn't work out.

150
00:09:14,077 --> 00:09:17,948
Speaker 1: I did enjoy the way Magfest did their hardcore challenge area where that wasn't.

151
00:09:17,988 --> 00:09:19,152
Speaker 0: they could do the pac-man That way.

152
00:09:19,173 --> 00:09:21,510
Speaker 0: they keep like, you know, here's a pac-man DX machine.

153
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:27,470
Speaker 0: Yep, anyone who you know, we're resetting the high scores on it, right anyone come over and play it at any time during the con.

154
00:09:28,112 --> 00:09:33,968
Speaker 0: As soon as you as soon as you take a try We're gonna write down your badge number and I think I saw pictures of badges with numbers on them.

155
00:09:34,972 --> 00:09:39,177
Speaker 0: We'll write down your badge number and that's if you try to you know Score out again when we will.

156
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:42,210
Speaker 0: we'll see that you've already scored on the spreadsheet or whatever.

157
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:49,420
Speaker 0: So you can't score again and everyone can try once at most and the highest score at the end of the con will mail you a prize Or something like that.

158
00:09:49,582 --> 00:09:50,551
Speaker 0: or well, you know They'll have.

159
00:09:50,571 --> 00:09:55,370
Speaker 0: no maybe they have an award ceremony while we're all waiting for the final omega thon to start instead of sitting there.

160
00:09:55,572 --> 00:09:57,714
Speaker 0: Yep, you know during their delay They do.

161
00:09:57,896 --> 00:09:59,510
Speaker 0: they could do a simple award ceremony.

162
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,610
Speaker 1: You do it like we did at RIT anime with like the trash talk Mario tennis tournaments.

163
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:09,270
Speaker 1: You have tournaments where all the qualifiers happen kind of on the down low and then the semi finals and finals Or maybe it was just the fine.

164
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:09,712
Speaker 0: I think about that.

165
00:10:09,732 --> 00:10:14,170
Speaker 0: you're waiting for the final omega thon and they have the final round of Street Fighter of.

166
00:10:15,391 --> 00:10:20,223
Speaker 0: You know these other like five other big tournaments like monkey ball Street Fighter.

167
00:10:20,263 --> 00:10:22,850
Speaker 0: Halo, you know pac-man and something else.

168
00:10:23,091 --> 00:10:30,299
Speaker 0: Right, you know they could have those while you're waiting for that final omega thon and it would be all like the highest skilled dudes It packs they also.

169
00:10:30,319 --> 00:10:36,776
Speaker 1: they do need to have more odd tournaments because some of my favorite tournaments were like when we do the Blindfolded monkey ball.

170
00:10:36,836 --> 00:10:39,608
Speaker 0: I think they just don't have the time and the resources for them, right?

171
00:10:39,649 --> 00:10:46,494
Speaker 0: It's like Yeah, you they've already dedicated so many TVs machines and Adjudicators to the man.

172
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:53,780
Speaker 1: if they had more manpower they could do things like that, but it's not just manpower It's manpower that's willing to deal with that kind of BS.

173
00:10:54,282 --> 00:10:55,426
Speaker 1: Anyway, I mean we've run that stuff.

174
00:10:55,466 --> 00:10:56,730
Speaker 1: It takes a lot of patience.

175
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:00,846
Speaker 0: Do you think it's a big time investment for the people in the tournaments?

176
00:11:01,007 --> 00:11:01,991
Speaker 0: Yeah bigger investment I think.

177
00:11:02,011 --> 00:11:02,836
Speaker 0: I run in the tournament.

178
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,070
Speaker 1: So I know a lot of you been playing magicka.

179
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:11,868
Speaker 0: I actually really haven't played it much yet But I played a whole bunch of levels, but then I stopped and I need somebody to finish it with.

180
00:11:12,069 --> 00:11:18,470
Speaker 1: yeah So there is an expansion that was announced to magicka and I thought it was actually a sequel is an expansion.

181
00:11:18,913 --> 00:11:19,901
Speaker 1: It's called an expansion.

182
00:11:20,042 --> 00:11:23,816
Speaker 1: Okay magicka Vietnam this is not a joke.

183
00:11:23,997 --> 00:11:26,164
Speaker 0: I'm not even it's a joke, but it's real.

184
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:26,746
Speaker 1: What is this?

185
00:11:26,826 --> 00:11:27,328
Speaker 1: I don't even.

186
00:11:27,368 --> 00:11:33,290
Speaker 1: this is Excellent and more people who are making real games need to do stuff like this.

187
00:11:33,772 --> 00:11:37,650
Speaker 1: It takes the piss out of the entire genre of realistic military sims.

188
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:42,870
Speaker 1: Yeah, I love the idea of stuff like this partly because you know our friend Scout Johnson.

189
00:11:43,352 --> 00:11:45,059
Speaker 1: What does he want more than anything in the world?

190
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,990
Speaker 1: a movie or fighter jets and dragons fight?

191
00:11:48,932 --> 00:11:50,460
Speaker 0: Well, this is wizards for soldiers.

192
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically the same kind of thing.

193
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:56,583
Speaker 1: Why do fantasy games have to be just fantasy and sci-fi have to be just sci-fi.

194
00:11:56,904 --> 00:11:58,830
Speaker 1: Why do the games have to make sense?

195
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,816
Speaker 1: Just just make stuff.

196
00:12:00,836 --> 00:12:02,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, even that shit doesn't make sense.

197
00:12:02,826 --> 00:12:07,885
Speaker 1: Yeah But I mean magic of Vietnam sounds crazy.

198
00:12:08,005 --> 00:12:11,524
Speaker 1: and yet people who have played Previews of it said it's awesome.

199
00:12:11,866 --> 00:12:15,905
Speaker 0: at first I was almost sort of slightly maybe offended by it.

200
00:12:16,186 --> 00:12:21,470
Speaker 0: like because You know, it's like a lot of some people out there they get offended from like real war games, right?

201
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,890
Speaker 0: They're like, oh you can't turn war into a game.

202
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:27,102
Speaker 0: You know wars for serious and you can sort of understand why.

203
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,410
Speaker 1: especially all right, but then what about a game like counter-strike?

204
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,410
Speaker 1: That's bait not based on a particular con.

205
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:31,775
Speaker 0: It's like.

206
00:12:31,856 --> 00:12:34,429
Speaker 0: I'm not person, you know I'm personally not offended by that.

207
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,096
Speaker 0: But this it was like.

208
00:12:36,116 --> 00:12:38,224
Speaker 0: I was almost offended because it was like.

209
00:12:38,245 --> 00:12:39,349
Speaker 0: it's making light of war.

210
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:41,083
Speaker 0: it's like lol war.

211
00:12:41,204 --> 00:12:41,628
Speaker 0: and I'm like.

212
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:50,161
Speaker 0: But I knowed another game that is equally because I sort of I sort of figured out that it's basically You know that this is really.

213
00:12:50,342 --> 00:12:51,490
Speaker 0: it's not being lol war.

214
00:12:51,651 --> 00:12:54,626
Speaker 0: It's saying lol realistic war games, which is sort of it's like.

215
00:12:54,727 --> 00:12:55,249
Speaker 0: I can go with that.

216
00:12:55,711 --> 00:13:00,065
Speaker 1: But also, I mean look at the original advanced wars games before they rebooted it dark and serious.

217
00:13:00,105 --> 00:13:03,396
Speaker 1: with the new DS one They're not really going lol war.

218
00:13:03,477 --> 00:13:04,701
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were going.

219
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:05,744
Speaker 0: they're just going war.

220
00:13:05,865 --> 00:13:06,447
Speaker 0: Yay.

221
00:13:06,507 --> 00:13:09,074
Speaker 0: Yay war It's like punch-out.

222
00:13:09,114 --> 00:13:10,178
Speaker 0: is the boxing right?

223
00:13:10,319 --> 00:13:10,820
Speaker 0: It's like real.

224
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:13,530
Speaker 0: boxing is bloody and brutal and punch-outs like boxing.

225
00:13:13,631 --> 00:13:15,802
Speaker 1: But at the same time look at the message of the old advanced wars.

226
00:13:15,842 --> 00:13:17,029
Speaker 0: All right fortress 2 is also war.

227
00:13:17,330 --> 00:13:24,406
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've got two generals and they're friends, but they're having a battle because what the fuck let's have a battle and they're like Yay, send my infantry in.

228
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:30,387
Speaker 1: Yay I'll defend with my tanks and then if you zoom in you've got tanks mowing down human beings fighting in in.

229
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:32,273
Speaker 0: they just disappear They're not being.

230
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:42,078
Speaker 0: I mean the difference is right is that you know when it's specifically Vietnam War And you've got magicians going around setting people on fire and shit It's like, you know, you're it's a.

231
00:13:42,179 --> 00:13:51,684
Speaker 1: it's a little bit different but at the same time I mean how if we go far back enough, I mean if someone made Magica Sparta Battle of Thermopylae Battle of Marathon.

232
00:13:51,704 --> 00:13:52,287
Speaker 0: Nobody would care.

233
00:13:52,447 --> 00:13:53,090
Speaker 1: Nobody would care.

234
00:13:53,431 --> 00:13:54,274
Speaker 1: Is it just a matter of?

235
00:13:54,315 --> 00:13:58,230
Speaker 1: well, those are people who fought and died and had these horrible experiences thousand years ago.

236
00:13:58,330 --> 00:13:58,873
Speaker 1: So that's okay.

237
00:13:58,893 --> 00:14:01,244
Speaker 0: I think I think pretty much too soon syndrome.

238
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:04,602
Speaker 0: No, I think what it is it's not the fact that it's too soon is that is a?

239
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:10,865
Speaker 0: it is a you know a graphic and brutal massacre and that you are trading basically an almost identical scenario.

240
00:14:10,905 --> 00:14:30,009
Speaker 0: a wizard goes in and Massacres all the people with fire right in a horrible way and but he's a cartoonish wizard, you know, it'd be like It's like what if I just if I took full metal jacket, right But I replaced all the characters with like the Watchmen to make it I know.

241
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:46,700
Speaker 1: And One other brief thing I do want to mention is that there's a game for the Super Nintendo that I Perennially will forget the name of want to refer to not know the name of it and then we'll have to say it's like Flashback on the Super Nintendo, but it came out way before.

242
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:55,310
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you're a guy it's called another world Yeah, and it's in the news because apparently it's being ported to the iPhone and the iPad.

243
00:14:55,491 --> 00:15:01,004
Speaker 0: Well, I get you know, that's a game where the graphics weren't astounding But they had this unique look that has never been replicated.

244
00:15:01,024 --> 00:15:02,090
Speaker 0: another game except flashback.

245
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,218
Speaker 1: Yeah, also for the day when that game came out.

246
00:15:04,259 --> 00:15:05,263
Speaker 1: It was fucking amazing.

247
00:15:05,463 --> 00:15:08,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean on the Super Nintendo It was a digitized.

248
00:15:08,856 --> 00:15:10,983
Speaker 1: I'm making quote marks game as in.

249
00:15:11,003 --> 00:15:15,273
Speaker 1: they modeled people and they made this kind of graphical Masterpiece.

250
00:15:15,474 --> 00:15:17,809
Speaker 1: Yeah, the game itself is actually not that fun.

251
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:26,654
Speaker 0: No it's just you know, it has this really unique artistic style to it that makes it stand out and actually it also keeps it modern even Though it's old.

252
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:27,561
Speaker 1: Well, it had that.

253
00:15:27,602 --> 00:15:28,650
Speaker 1: the game was fun in itself.

254
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:36,060
Speaker 1: It had this interesting concept of dying gave you various cinematics of your gruesome death Yeah, and I think that was half the fun of the game.

255
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:38,030
Speaker 1: Yeah problem, you know about all those slugs.

256
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,956
Speaker 1: Let's see what happens.

257
00:15:38,996 --> 00:15:41,230
Speaker 0: a lot of the game was basically an adventure game, right?

258
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:44,272
Speaker 0: Cuz you had to solve puzzle game, but it had a real-time component.

259
00:15:44,473 --> 00:15:53,947
Speaker 0: you had to solve puzzles in the adventure game sort of Monkey Island way, but you did it with a Real-time thing not like Dragon's Lair, but like a platforming more like Prince of Persia.

260
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:55,915
Speaker 1: It was a Original Prince of Persia.

261
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:58,605
Speaker 1: It's a cross between Prince of Persia and Dragon's Lair.

262
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:03,381
Speaker 0: It has some Dragon's Larry bullshit It does but the thing is it had Prince of Persia controls.

263
00:16:03,601 --> 00:16:06,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, perhaps even or Dragon's Lair and he has controls.

264
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:13,030
Speaker 1: I never got past Where you get when you first get the laser gun and you get out of the jail and you're crawling through the steam vents.

265
00:16:13,492 --> 00:16:16,026
Speaker 1: Past that point never never once in my whole life.

266
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:16,488
Speaker 1: All right.

267
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:18,777
Speaker 0: So is that the end of your newses?

268
00:16:18,838 --> 00:16:19,018
Speaker 0: Yeah.

269
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,110
Speaker 0: All right, so there's this game coming out called dark spore.

270
00:16:22,392 --> 00:16:24,222
Speaker 0: I didn't even know about it until today.

271
00:16:24,242 --> 00:16:30,002
Speaker 0: this heart this morning Amazon emailed me and said here's a beta key for dark spore.

Speaker 0: Remember the game that failed?

279
00:16:41,506 --> 00:16:42,489
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

280
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,336
Speaker 0: So what dark spore is?

281
00:16:45,597 --> 00:16:47,805
Speaker 0: it's basically Diablo spore.

282
00:16:48,086 --> 00:16:48,828
Speaker 0: You got a guy.

283
00:16:48,848 --> 00:16:49,430
Speaker 0: you click.

284

Speaker 0: It's a three-quarter isometric view.

285
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:54,350
Speaker 0: you click he walks there you click on bad guys you hit them and they die.

286
00:16:55,231 --> 00:17:01,530
Speaker 0: It's got a little bit though of the more complex controls and in a dota sort of way, right?

287
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:05,750
Speaker 0: So first of all, you've got a team of three guys up to three maybe even four guys.

288
00:17:05,810 --> 00:17:09,724
Speaker 0: I never got a four switch between him like a. do you can switch between them in real time?

289
00:17:10,067 --> 00:17:10,930
Speaker 0: You can't do it quickly.

290
00:17:11,010 --> 00:17:14,508
Speaker 0: It's like you switch and you to wait like a few seconds before you're allowed to switch, huh?

291
00:17:15,111 --> 00:17:16,034
Speaker 0: Right, so you can.

292
00:17:16,094 --> 00:17:20,531
Speaker 0: you can carry a healer and a fire and a tank and another guy the same right and you switch between Them.

293
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,464
Speaker 0: I think there's also a co-op or and PvP.

294
00:17:23,505 --> 00:17:30,350
Speaker 0: if you go online maybe and It's pretty much Diablo you click on the bad guys and they die and you also.

295
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:36,569
Speaker 0: You can have special attacks which are number which are the number keys You press like number one to do your weak attack and number two.

296
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:51,270
Speaker 0: Did you your second your strongest special attack and you're just your regular old click is a regular old attack, you know The only thing that was spore like about it Is that when you get equipment and you and you can equip the equipment as in an RPG?

297
00:17:51,970 --> 00:17:58,919
Speaker 0: You actually position the equipment on your guy and you know rotate it and all that stuff using the spore Character kind of thing.

298
00:17:58,939 --> 00:18:05,990
Speaker 0: You don't actually get to make your character You just you just get them but you can equip them in a spore customizing kind of way.

299
00:18:07,352 --> 00:18:08,237
Speaker 0: This game is really bad.

300
00:18:08,257 --> 00:18:10,350
Speaker 0: I don't see how it was boring as hell.

301
00:18:10,350 --> 00:18:13,090
Speaker 0: It's pretty much they somehow made Diablo even more boring.

302
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,083
Speaker 0: You literally do nothing but click on bad guys and that's that's pretty much it.

303
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:17,665
Speaker 1: Wow.

304
00:18:18,146 --> 00:18:28,909
Speaker 0: It's just click on bad guys duly noted And in completely boring environments and they tried to do some interesting things with the bad guys Like there's a bad guy who shoots a teleporter at you.

305
00:18:29,211 --> 00:18:35,777
Speaker 0: So every time it hits you you teleport and there's some bad guys you shoot bullets at you that are slow So you can actually skillfully sort of dodge them.

306
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:39,650
Speaker 0: and they tried to do some stuff with the bad guys to make it interesting.

307
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:45,550
Speaker 0: But really it just clicking on guys and it's I would you know of Diablo torchlight and darkspore.

308
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:51,330
Speaker 0: I'll take torchlight which is playable playable enough that I was actually beat it and was cheap five bucks.

309
00:18:57,742 --> 00:19:12,492
Speaker 1: So things of the day, um college humor, you know We use a lot of college humor stuff for things of the day And I actually gonna do it again because they've made a show that is pretty damn solid and if it continues in the vein That is continuing I would continue to watch it.

310
00:19:12,552 --> 00:19:13,880
Speaker 1: I would recommend that all of you do the same.

311
00:19:14,123 --> 00:19:21,300
Speaker 0: It's similar in Structure to an ESPN show pardon the interruption, which is you know, I tried to make geek nights sort of like that.

312
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:25,597
Speaker 1: But yeah, we thought it doesn't resemble it in any way in the early conceptual days of geek nights.

313
00:19:25,637 --> 00:19:29,946
Speaker 1: Yeah but nerd alert is Basically a nerd talk show.

314
00:19:29,966 --> 00:19:33,700
Speaker 1: It's kind of like geek nights but a little slower and with an extra person.

315
00:19:34,102 --> 00:19:35,510
Speaker 0: Well, it's much shorter.

316
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:36,054
Speaker 0: and video.

317
00:19:36,094 --> 00:19:36,315
Speaker 0: Yeah.

318
00:19:36,436 --> 00:19:38,730
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, is that I gotta say?

319
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,514
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all I gotta say.

320
00:19:39,534 --> 00:19:40,057
Speaker 1: It's good.

321
00:19:40,098 --> 00:19:40,359
Speaker 1: Watch it.

322
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:49,155
Speaker 1: They interview the guy who when he was a kid was in that Mortal Kombat ad where Kane was come or Kano was coming out Of the box and getting the guy.

323
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:58,825
Speaker 0: Yeah Anyway, so if you ever have you ever wanted to play an MMO that looked like Final Fantasy 1 Kinda I could do that.

324
00:19:58,965 --> 00:20:01,294
Speaker 0: Maybe there is one is it's a hundred percent free-to-play.

325
00:20:01,334 --> 00:20:08,402
Speaker 0: It's called nostalgia and That's pretty much what it is an MMO that looks like Final Fantasy and plays like Final Fantasy 1.

326
00:20:08,402 --> 00:20:11,460
Speaker 1: So I walk around and level up to 99 over the course of the next five years.

327
00:20:11,589 --> 00:20:14,533
Speaker 0: Yeah I basically I played it for a minute and I was just as soon as I got to that.

328
00:20:14,593 --> 00:20:19,823
Speaker 0: I walked into the town and then I was just like Stop playing.

329
00:20:20,869 --> 00:20:22,880
Speaker 1: Can you talk to people like can you do all the MMO stuff?

330
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:25,696
Speaker 0: I played it for about 10 seconds before I realized.

331
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:30,444
Speaker 0: Oh, right It's like.

332
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:34,497
Speaker 0: the concept on the one hand makes you want to play it But then as soon as you play it, you're like, I don't want to play this.

333
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:36,567
Speaker 0: It's thinking today worthy.

334
00:20:36,628 --> 00:20:38,700
Speaker 1: anyway, I'd say so I will check it out.

335
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:42,114
Speaker 1: Yeah, I will not check out the beta key that I got from Amazon though.

336
00:20:42,135 --> 00:20:43,340
Speaker 0: Apparently they have it.

337
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:50,220
Speaker 0: They do have an optional yearly subscription that enables some non-essential features such as you can leveling monsters.

338
00:20:50,581 --> 00:20:50,863
Speaker 1: There's.

339
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,353
Speaker 0: there's extra classes that you can't get like.

340
00:20:53,393 --> 00:20:54,940
Speaker 0: you can only be some base classes.

341
00:20:55,081 --> 00:20:57,960
Speaker 1: If you don't pay you can't be a fighter or a wizard.

342
00:20:58,261 --> 00:21:02,200
Speaker 0: You can be I think wizards the most fancy thing you can be but you can't be anything fancier than that.

343
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:04,234
Speaker 1: What's fancier than wizard there was.

344
00:21:04,254 --> 00:21:05,000
Speaker 0: there were eight choices.

345
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:09,740
Speaker 0: I think you only get four for free and then you can also customize your guys appearance.

346
00:21:09,881 --> 00:21:11,759
Speaker 0: You know that way people can tell that you paid money.

Speaker 0: Yep.

375
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:15,160
Speaker 0: All right.

376
00:22:16,321 --> 00:22:24,060
Speaker 1: So so a few weekends ago, we were up in Albany You know having a big old front row crew party as we are often likening to do and we played a game.

377
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:37,690
Speaker 1: Well, this game was sold to us by a friend of a friend who hung out at the party and he sold it to a friend of ours the whale shark in the forum and the whale shark described it to me as It's an Arabian Nights themed Role-board playing game

378
00:22:38,051 --> 00:22:43,211
Speaker 0: and I was like, all right, you know This is do not confuse this with Arabian Nights the role-playing game.

379
00:22:43,251 --> 00:22:45,860
Speaker 0: There is a tabletop role-playing game called Arabian Nights.

380
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:47,836
Speaker 1: Well, it's called a thousand and one nights that game.

381
00:22:48,078 --> 00:22:48,220
Speaker 0: Okay?

382
00:22:48,361 --> 00:22:51,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there are a lot of games that are have a rate.

383
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,550
Speaker 0: They're called Arabian Nights or a thousand and one.

384
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,262
Speaker 0: Arabian Nights or a thousand and one nights or Arabian Right.

385
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,049
Speaker 0: do not confuse this with the other ones.

386
00:22:58,089 --> 00:23:00,358
Speaker 0: This is tales of Arabian Nights.

387
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,672
Speaker 1: Yes 1985 though apparently it has been changed many times since then.

388
00:23:05,692 --> 00:23:05,772
Speaker 0: Yes.

389
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:08,180
Speaker 0: It is a board game that is currently published by who?

390
00:23:10,881 --> 00:23:13,330
Speaker 1: It's published by West End Games currently, okay.

391
00:23:13,972 --> 00:23:16,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, so just don't get it confused with the other ones, right?

392
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,675
Speaker 0: We'll have a board game geek link in the show willing to it.

393
00:23:18,917 --> 00:23:20,424
Speaker 0: now, you know Which one we're talking about?

394
00:23:20,444 --> 00:23:24,802
Speaker 1: the interesting thing about this game is that it was sold to us as a role-playing game Like.

395
00:23:24,862 --> 00:23:26,172
Speaker 0: it's also a board game.

396
00:23:26,253 --> 00:23:27,160
Speaker 1: It's a storytelling game.

397
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:34,746
Speaker 1: You play the game to win you move guys around you're trying to become the hero of Baghdad go on missions complete quest come back But you can win right?

398
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:40,188
Speaker 0: So it's I was originally I was thinking it was gonna be something, you know They said a role-playing board game.

399
00:23:40,228 --> 00:23:42,039
Speaker 0: So I thought it would be more like.

400
00:23:43,183 --> 00:23:45,340
Speaker 0: You know the hero quest kind of thing.

401
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,970
Speaker 0: right because that's most of what people say when they mean role-playing.

402
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:53,732
Speaker 1: but no we were told but it was more like a choose your Own adventure that there is a sort of storytelling mechanic.

403
00:23:53,893 --> 00:23:55,820
Speaker 0: So I thought it would be hero quest with more story.

404
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:58,677
Speaker 1: I expected something more because they said choose your own adventure.

405
00:23:58,717 --> 00:24:01,428
Speaker 1: sure enough This game comes with a big fucking.

406
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:02,792
Speaker 1: choose your own adventure book.

407
00:24:03,093 --> 00:24:09,500
Speaker 0: that is fairly elegantly put together See, but actually even then I was still thinking because do you remember I forget the name of the game?

408
00:24:09,561 --> 00:24:11,060
Speaker 0: It was the Dungeons and Dragons game.

409
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:11,362
Speaker 0: It was.

410
00:24:11,663 --> 00:24:14,500
Speaker 0: it was around the second edition times and it came in a big box.

411
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,848
Speaker 0: You opened up this man dragon strike was.

412
00:24:16,888 --> 00:24:20,280
Speaker 0: it did had a big box full of cards and the cards told you were the GM.

413
00:24:20,681 --> 00:24:21,223
Speaker 0: You remember that?

414
00:24:21,364 --> 00:24:22,086
Speaker 0: now it was.

415
00:24:22,106 --> 00:24:24,916
Speaker 0: there was a D&D game because I a friend of mine had it and you.

416
00:24:24,956 --> 00:24:25,759
Speaker 0: basically it was D&D.

417
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:29,290
Speaker 0: Walk around hit monsters, but you there was no GM.

418
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,380
Speaker 0: There was a big box of cards that acted as the GM.

419
00:24:33,164 --> 00:24:39,278
Speaker 0: so this is Sort of like that where the book is the GM, but it's instead of doing a hit things.

420
00:24:39,439 --> 00:24:39,740
Speaker 0: RPG.

421
00:24:40,101 --> 00:24:42,348
Speaker 0: It's a storytelling RPG where a book is the GM.

422
00:24:42,588 --> 00:24:49,191
Speaker 1: now I we've played this game once and I have my judgment on it But before I have only played it once.

423
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:56,510
Speaker 0: but I do think we played it for many hours And I do think it was sufficient and we didn't finish well here but it was sufficient enough to pass these.

424
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:00,325
Speaker 1: the playing time that that game says is 120 minutes bullshit.

425
00:25:02,402 --> 00:25:09,920
Speaker 1: We played this game for over four hours and we're nowhere near anything even resembling the Midway Point.

426
00:25:10,402 --> 00:25:12,368
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are full of shit.

427
00:25:12,589 --> 00:25:14,476
Speaker 1: That is that is 120 minutes is?

428
00:25:14,496 --> 00:25:15,700
Speaker 1: they might as well just shoot you in the face.

429
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:16,365
Speaker 1: that is such.

430
00:25:16,648 --> 00:25:21,520
Speaker 1: that is a lie, but Not to not to say whether or not I like the game or not.

431
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,740
Speaker 1: The way the game works is you have a guy and then all these different characters.

432
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:28,737
Speaker 0: Sinbad I wanted to be Alibaba but rim took I was Alibaba.

433
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:54,200
Speaker 1: Hell's yeah And your character has a gender male or female and you pick skills and the skills are things like luck Weapon use quick thinking and there's a whole bunch of them sailing And you have a wealth level and your wealth level goes up and down based on things and basically on your turn You decide based on you know Your wealth level which is how far you can move where you want to move on this map of Europe Africa the Middle East and Russia

434
00:25:54,703 --> 00:25:54,924
Speaker 0: yep,

435
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:59,566
Speaker 1: and what looks like parts of Australia maybe and Britain and everything.

436
00:25:59,586 --> 00:26:09,753
Speaker 1: and then you draw a card and based on the card you look up all these numbers and tables and charts and the person you're right and the person you left both Have a different reference and between all of them.

437
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:11,200
Speaker 1: They will come to a conflict.

438
00:26:12,162 --> 00:26:13,368
Speaker 1: They read the conflict you.

439
00:26:13,469 --> 00:26:13,569
Speaker 1: it's

440
00:26:13,610 --> 00:26:30,837
Speaker 0: kind of magical right because it's like first There's a number on the spot you land on and then you roll a die and then you add some numbers together and then they Look up a number on a card and then you draw a card and they look at the number on the card and then they Look up a number on a chart and then you actually get to choose a reaction to something.

441
00:26:30,877 --> 00:26:31,760
Speaker 0: so it'll be like alright.

442
00:26:32,122 --> 00:26:34,494
Speaker 0: You know at this point that you're encountering a wizard.

443
00:26:34,836 --> 00:26:35,580
Speaker 0: What do you want to do?

444
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:38,560
Speaker 0: Do you want to beg borrow steal bite?

445
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,588
Speaker 0: You know, what do you want to do to this wizard?

446
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:42,600
Speaker 0: and it's like a list of possible reactions?

447
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,606
Speaker 0: No, this is the cool.

448
00:26:43,627 --> 00:26:45,200
Speaker 0: This is sort of the role-playing part.

449
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,727
Speaker 0: It's like do you want to steal from the wizard?

450
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:48,335
Speaker 0: Do you want to attack the wizard?

451
00:26:48,355 --> 00:26:49,400
Speaker 0: Do you want to beg the wizard?

452
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,126
Speaker 0: Do you want to help the wizard right?

453
00:26:51,267 --> 00:26:51,768
Speaker 1: But here's the good.

454
00:26:51,788 --> 00:26:52,752
Speaker 1: This is why this is cool.

455
00:26:52,772 --> 00:26:58,996
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're presented with a Character you're going to meet like a lonely wizard or an angry with.

456
00:26:59,057 --> 00:27:00,825
Speaker 0: it might not be a wizard It might be a monster.

457
00:27:00,865 --> 00:27:12,791
Speaker 1: It might be an event like, you know, you're in a marketplace Yeah, but but it's always it tends to be like an adjective and something like you're in a spooky palace Yeah, or you encounter a crying dervish.

458
00:27:13,052 --> 00:27:15,540
Speaker 1: Yep, and you're not told what the situation is.

459
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:24,444
Speaker 1: You're only told what it is that you're encountering and then based on the encounters and the references you have a list of Approaches to whatever it is You're going to encounter like.

460
00:27:24,765 --> 00:27:29,503
Speaker 1: basically it'll come down to things like be pious be honest attack it He'll.

461
00:27:29,523 --> 00:27:38,565
Speaker 0: you know all these verbs do something Yep, and after you pick a verb they look at a bunch of charts and they use another die to add a slight amount of Randomization to it.

462
00:27:38,585 --> 00:27:39,651
Speaker 0: So it was not exactly the same.

463
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:43,511
Speaker 1: every time plus one or minus one The story could go in some slightly different ways.

464
00:27:43,592 --> 00:27:45,220
Speaker 1: make it to make a team make a time make it though.

465
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,893
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not just you know set in stone or I believe I believe.

466
00:27:48,154 --> 00:27:50,400
Speaker 1: make a team make a time make a toe make a - yep anyway.

467
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:56,040
Speaker 0: Then they finally look in the book and they read something to you and it's sort of magical that you did all these crazy numbers.

468
00:27:56,482 --> 00:27:58,771
Speaker 0: And then someone eventually is like you.

469
00:27:58,911 --> 00:28:05,140
Speaker 0: they read directly from the book and this big book They come out and they'd be like you encounter a crying dervish.

470
00:28:05,481 --> 00:28:10,200
Speaker 1: He is crying over the fact that he has lost the knife that was given to him by his father and his father's father.

471
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:17,255
Speaker 1: And then it's like alright because you took steel You try to steal it from him and he catches you and punishes you.

472
00:28:17,275 --> 00:28:21,744
Speaker 1: and you now have the cursed statistic or the cursed trait added to your character.

473
00:28:21,825 --> 00:28:22,146
Speaker 1: or you

474
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:22,768
Speaker 0: get points

475
00:28:22,969 --> 00:28:35,340
Speaker 1: or your gender has changed and you get some points and you win by getting a combination of fate points and story points and it's pretty fucking arbitrary as to which ones you get and when you get them and Depending if you have a skill like it might say like it'll read the story.

476
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:35,762
Speaker 1: They're like art.

477
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:37,830
Speaker 1: you encounter the angry wizard.

478
00:28:37,911 --> 00:28:39,297
Speaker 1: He is a wizard and he is angry up.

479
00:28:40,381 --> 00:28:44,011
Speaker 1: Scott does your character have the lucky or the pious skill?

480
00:28:44,092 --> 00:28:45,095
Speaker 0: I have the lucky skill.

481
00:28:45,295 --> 00:28:46,097
Speaker 1: Do you want to use it?

482
00:28:46,118 --> 00:28:47,825
Speaker 0: Uh, Yes.

483
00:28:48,168 --> 00:28:48,329
Speaker 1: Now.

484
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:49,499
Speaker 1: Here's the problem with the game.

485
00:28:50,341 --> 00:28:54,014
Speaker 1: Using a skill seems to be about 50/50 good or bad for you.

486
00:28:54,034 --> 00:28:56,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you might say yes I'll use my lucky skill.

487
00:28:56,800 --> 00:28:59,455
Speaker 0: Well, you might have actually been better off not using the lucky skill.

488
00:28:59,495 --> 00:29:03,315
Speaker 1: if you're trying to win Yep, or it'll be like do you have the wounded traits?

489
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,253
Speaker 1: Oh Well, then and then the story changes.

490
00:29:06,576 --> 00:29:22,280
Speaker 0: Yep But basically it it's weird cuz like it's a role-playing game and like this book is full of this story and it's sort of crazy How the story actually works and matches what's going on, but at the same time you really have pretty much no control.

491
00:29:23,582 --> 00:29:27,860
Speaker 0: At least no, you know, you know intelligent control over winning or losing.

492
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:33,337
Speaker 0: It might as well just be random and then on top of that the rules start to get shaky.

493
00:29:33,357 --> 00:29:34,200
Speaker 0: the game.

494
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:35,783
Speaker 1: Here's my judgment.

495
00:29:36,405 --> 00:29:39,014
Speaker 1: it is I'm sorry a shit game.

496
00:29:39,496 --> 00:29:41,303
Speaker 1: It is not worth playing It is not.

497
00:29:41,343 --> 00:29:43,072
Speaker 0: we're definitely not for the time investment.

498
00:29:43,112 --> 00:29:44,499
Speaker 0: It's really cool to see it.

499
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:52,669
Speaker 0: You know just experience like a few turns to see the magic of how they set up this book and how much work that must Have been and it's like as a work of craftsmanship like.

500
00:29:52,710 --> 00:29:54,456
Speaker 0: I can respect it like damn, but it is.

501
00:29:54,616 --> 00:29:56,545
Speaker 0: I'm gonna pull this off Unplayable.

502
00:29:56,585 --> 00:29:59,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not gonna spend hours investing into it.

503
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,043
Speaker 0: That is not worth it.

504
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:11,000
Speaker 1: find someone who owns it get them to run it for you And have someone else ready to call you with a fake emergency a couple hours later to get you out of the situation.

505
00:30:11,403 --> 00:30:12,109
Speaker 0: Yeah, good idea.

506
00:30:12,412 --> 00:30:15,067
Speaker 1: this game Just doesn't work.

507
00:30:15,308 --> 00:30:18,320
Speaker 1: like your actions you move around this whole board of the world.

508
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:26,828
Speaker 1: You're given these destination tokens and these origin tokens and like I come from here and I go from there and my wife is Living there and I'm a criminal in this city.

509
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:33,270
Speaker 0: That stuff is so incomprehensible and meaningless and the Part of it is that a lot of this stuff just conflicts.

510
00:30:33,711 --> 00:30:35,457
Speaker 0: the rules just conflict blatantly.

511
00:30:35,518 --> 00:30:36,782
Speaker 0: It'll be like, alright I'm wounded.

512
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:38,108
Speaker 0: So that means this but I'm married.

513
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:39,976
Speaker 0: that means this and what happens on both.

514
00:30:40,398 --> 00:30:45,337
Speaker 1: It's like The rules of the game have changed many times throughout its lifespan to like.

515
00:30:45,377 --> 00:30:51,712
Speaker 1: apparently in the past You can only have one trait at a time, but then now you can have multiple traits But the traits are sometimes mutually exclusive.

516
00:30:52,054 --> 00:30:52,839
Speaker 1: It just doesn't work.

517
00:30:53,782 --> 00:30:57,486
Speaker 1: Every turn we ran into multiple Unresolvable rules questions.

518
00:30:57,627 --> 00:31:05,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, they thought through the book of story really well but they didn't really think through the rules of the traits and that sort of the winning and the losing very well at all.

519
00:31:05,939 --> 00:31:09,413
Speaker 1: and on top of that the stories are not created equal.

520
00:31:09,433 --> 00:31:16,457
Speaker 1: some of the stories are like Ten sets of crazy questions and do this and this and this and crazy stuff happens like and it's like yeah I got an awesome story.

521
00:31:16,498 --> 00:31:18,908
Speaker 0: sweet my turn is so fun and then my turn will come up.

522
00:31:19,009 --> 00:31:25,415
Speaker 1: and it's like you meet a crying beggar and I pick like Steal or kidnap or something and the story just doesn't go anywhere.

523
00:31:25,496 --> 00:31:26,380
Speaker 1: Nothing happens like great.

524
00:31:26,521 --> 00:31:29,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, someone's sitting there writing this huge book of stories.

525
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,868
Speaker 0: They're not gonna write all of them to be awesome.

526
00:31:31,908 --> 00:31:35,140
Speaker 0: You know, the worst part right is that it's on the board.

527
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:39,113
Speaker 0: They tantalize you with these places of power and it's like oh man.

528
00:31:39,455 --> 00:31:44,071
Speaker 0: I want to go to the places of power I want to go able to legitimately get to any.

529
00:31:44,151 --> 00:31:45,576
Speaker 1: we couldn't get to the brass city.

530
00:31:45,596 --> 00:31:49,540
Speaker 0: Yeah, I want to go to the brass City, I wanted to go to the cave of wonders.

531
00:31:49,801 --> 00:31:53,120
Speaker 0: I wanted to go to all these places that had super awesome magic in them.

532
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:58,200
Speaker 0: Right, you could you can't actually go there unless something else lets you go there.

533
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,420
Speaker 1: Even at the board game geek forums people point out that yeah You're pretty much never gonna get to those places.

534
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:02,560
Speaker 1: The

535
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:07,353
Speaker 0: other thing is the game has three phases of day like evening and then

536
00:32:07,674 --> 00:32:10,080
Speaker 1: or hours didn't even get us through day

537
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:20,034
Speaker 0: Right, so it's like there's a whole bunch of this game that is pretty much inaccessible because apparently the game usually ends during the day And you're never actually gonna get to the night time.

538
00:32:20,074 --> 00:32:20,898
Speaker 0: this game doesn't end.

539
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:31,160
Speaker 1: Now I guess my real problem is that what the way the game I mean all the coolness aside I'm not gonna get into all the cool mechanics it has because they're all pretty cool individually.

540
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:32,663
Speaker 1: Actually playing them.

541
00:32:33,105 --> 00:32:34,550
Speaker 1: the way the game works is on your turn.

542
00:32:34,811 --> 00:32:36,958
Speaker 1: you you decide where you want to move which doesn't mean shit.

543
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,334
Speaker 0: You go you go to your nearest quest dot.

544
00:32:40,374 --> 00:32:41,540
Speaker 0: that happens to be your color.

545
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:49,167
Speaker 1: Yeah move around land somewhere look up a whole bunch of numbers and then the people the right and left you do all the work and Then you're presented with a trivial nothing.

546
00:32:49,468 --> 00:33:00,260
Speaker 1: you pick an arbitrary option and then a short sometimes trivial Story that you have no control over is relayed to you And then the other player takes their turn and basically you have no input the game doesn't do anything.

547
00:33:00,623 --> 00:33:02,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like this illusion of input, right?

548
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:06,035
Speaker 0: It's like they give you these choices that feel like role-playing game choices.

549
00:33:06,095 --> 00:33:07,040
Speaker 0: Like do you beg bar?

550
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:07,925
Speaker 0: You know, what?

551
00:33:08,187 --> 00:33:10,120
Speaker 0: How are you going to react to this situation?

552
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:15,963
Speaker 1: I love this role-playing idea of you're presented with a situation and a course of action But no specifics.

553
00:33:15,983 --> 00:33:18,592
Speaker 1: like you're presented with such an abstracted like.

554
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:20,097
Speaker 1: alright, what would my character do?

555
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:20,780
Speaker 1: Would he beg?

556
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:21,917
Speaker 1: What do you flee?

557
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,690
Speaker 1: Would he use a weapon and then based on that that tells the story.

558
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:28,820
Speaker 1: but the reality is the stories are all kind of pointless.

559
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,594
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the game would be great if it was just a storytelling system.

560
00:33:32,654 --> 00:33:36,230
Speaker 1: Why bother with this whole Overly complex pointless game?

561
00:33:36,250 --> 00:33:38,080
Speaker 1: that's kind of like hacked on the top of it?

562
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think what they should do is they should take the book story part, right?

563
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:47,722
Speaker 0: What they should do is they should make a game where everyone has sort of a character sheet with an inventory and these sorts Of things.

564
00:33:47,782 --> 00:33:51,216
Speaker 0: right and it's choose your own adventure, but it's co-op.

565
00:33:51,316 --> 00:33:52,300
Speaker 0: choose your own adventure.

566
00:33:52,380 --> 00:34:02,475
Speaker 0: So it's like you're in a party and you just turn to page one and you read it and then it says alright You know to do this go to page two to do this go to page three and it's like.

567
00:34:02,756 --> 00:34:03,077
Speaker 0: and then it.

568
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:05,796
Speaker 0: people can even have their own private books for their characters.

569
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:09,679
Speaker 0: or it's like You know, this is the stuff that they learn that no one else learns.

570
00:34:09,781 --> 00:34:11,500
Speaker 0: So it might be like are you turn to page three?

571
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:27,193
Speaker 0: You know Scott should go or Alibaba should turn to page five in his personal book and you know read that and then it's like Alibaba can do his own thing just sitting there reading, you know, and also the party is doing something, you know And then Alibaba maybe suddenly has a treasure.

572
00:34:27,254 --> 00:34:28,339
Speaker 0: No one knows how we got it.

573
00:34:28,600 --> 00:34:47,480
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so, you know something like that and then that could be get all the good parts of this game Which is you know a pre-written choose your own adventure with limited replay value without Taking forever or having bullshit complicated rules of statuses that conflict with each other and quests and Trying to fit winning and losing and role-playing.

574
00:34:48,341 --> 00:34:50,667
Speaker 1: Losing has no bearing on anything like winning.

575
00:34:50,687 --> 00:34:52,371
Speaker 1: this game is completely random.

576
00:34:52,532 --> 00:34:53,274
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like some.

577
00:34:53,375 --> 00:34:55,982
Speaker 0: it's basically the winning can basically be considered A timer.

578
00:34:56,022 --> 00:35:02,026
Speaker 0: it's like when somebody any of the players has had enough story that is good Then they win.

579
00:35:02,046 --> 00:35:02,973
Speaker 0: and then what?

580
00:35:02,993 --> 00:35:10,841
Speaker 1: like an example of fiddliness There's two kinds of victory points and before the game starts and before you know anything you decide how many of each you need to Win.

581
00:35:11,443 --> 00:35:20,980
Speaker 1: but there's no real way to say you're gonna get one point or the other point in the course of stories And sometimes the bad endings give you more points than the good endings and it just doesn't make any sense.

582
00:35:21,281 --> 00:35:22,966
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the game just.

583
00:35:23,247 --> 00:35:29,729
Speaker 1: it's so tedious and the stories by and large would be cool If the game were a storytelling game, but it's not.

584
00:35:30,151 --> 00:35:33,525
Speaker 1: it's like this trivial text where you read out Well, this is what happened.

585
00:35:33,926 --> 00:35:37,100
Speaker 1: Maybe if the players were telling the stories somehow it'd be more fun.

586
00:35:37,160 --> 00:35:40,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know the fact that the stories are pre-told is I you know?

587
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,080
Speaker 0: It's like as opposed to us coming up with the store.

588
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,469
Speaker 1: They're pre-told pretty weekly to actually the.

589
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:46,754
Speaker 1: the stories themselves are.

590
00:35:47,075 --> 00:35:51,880
Speaker 1: they're mostly consistent But they're just kind of written weirdly and they used weird phrasing.

591
00:35:51,961 --> 00:35:54,960
Speaker 1: I get the impression that multiple people were writing the stories.

592
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,840
Speaker 0: There was no way one person did this.

593
00:35:57,201 --> 00:36:01,977
Speaker 1: Not a lot of meshing between the thematic like style of all of these different people?

594
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:02,760
Speaker 0: no not at all.

595
00:36:03,662 --> 00:36:04,688
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know what else I can say.

596
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,860
Speaker 1: The game is not worth playing.

597
00:36:07,141 --> 00:36:10,671
Speaker 1: It's kind of terrible, but there's such a good idea here.

598
00:36:11,172 --> 00:36:12,055
Speaker 1: Someone should give someone.

599
00:36:12,095 --> 00:36:16,868
Speaker 1: if you want you should buy this game and Deconstructed and make a simpler better game.

600
00:36:16,908 --> 00:36:18,413
Speaker 1: that does some of the things this does.

601
00:36:18,494 --> 00:36:20,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I mean, you know, it was painful.

602
00:36:20,381 --> 00:36:21,545
Speaker 0: It took a long time.

603
00:36:21,605 --> 00:36:50,300
Speaker 0: It had a lot of bullshit rules and you know, if you can avoid caring about those rules maybe you could have fun with it, but at the same time the book as Poorly written as it was and as simple as some of the stories were like when you went through that book there was some sort of magic there and that you would draw a wizard card and roll some dice and add a whole bunch of Crazy numbers and then somehow you ended up hearing a story about a wizard and your reaction to it Actually sort of made sense with the story that was told and it came from a book.

604
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:54,206
Speaker 0: It was sort of like whoa, so, you know that Magical component there.

605
00:36:54,246 --> 00:37:00,392
Speaker 0: I think there is something that you know is good but and that's what made the rest of the game so much more disappointing.

606
00:37:00,412 --> 00:37:10,391
Speaker 0: cuz like I have to suffer through all this BS with Confusing rules in 10 hours just to have fun with this book like the way I would play the game I came up with one way that this game is worthwhile.

607
00:37:10,773 --> 00:37:19,920
Speaker 1: if you forget the winning and losing and You kind of ignore any mechanics about getting victory points and you just have four artists sit down and play the game and the rule.

608
00:37:20,602 --> 00:37:35,520
Speaker 1: After your story you have to draw a little comic like a three or four panel comic that tells the story your character just had happened to them and Then as you go around everyone's drawing this comic this continuity of their character at the end You'll get four mini comic books.

609
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,279
Speaker 1: This is the kind of thing artists could sit down on a Saturday and have a cool thing come out of.

610
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:40,506
Speaker 0: yeah It would take all day though.

611
00:37:40,566 --> 00:37:40,767
Speaker 0: Yeah.

612
00:37:40,988 --> 00:37:42,779
Speaker 1: Well, it takes all day to play the fucking game anyway.

613
00:37:43,942 --> 00:37:46,880
Speaker 0: It would take even longer if you just stop and draw comic every time you had a turn.

614
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:51,983
Speaker 1: What's amazing is the game is ranked very highly on board game geek 7.2 out of 10.

615
00:37:51,983 --> 00:37:53,511
Speaker 0: That's not that high but it is.

616
00:37:53,531 --> 00:37:55,040
Speaker 0: it is higher than I would give it.

617
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:57,616
Speaker 0: I would give it five and the forum on it is interesting.

618
00:37:57,697 --> 00:38:08,350
Speaker 1: It is 99 billion rules questions with no Canonical answers a million fiddly bits and half the questions are people saying well They're people saying things like.

619
00:38:08,673 --> 00:38:10,645
Speaker 1: this is the best game ever I love is my favorite game.

620
00:38:10,986 --> 00:38:13,135
Speaker 1: and the other half the people saying this game is unplayable.

621
00:38:13,155 --> 00:38:14,099
Speaker 1: What the fuck is wrong with you?

622
00:38:15,701 --> 00:38:17,047
Speaker 0: That's why I give it five stars.

623
00:38:17,087 --> 00:38:19,680
Speaker 0: right because on the one hand it's not it's not the worst right.

624
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,248
Speaker 0: It's not like Hellas or anything.

625
00:38:21,892 --> 00:38:25,748
Speaker 1: Hellas at least did not take Infinity time to play that's true.

626
00:38:25,908 --> 00:38:27,072
Speaker 0: But you know, it has.

627
00:38:27,253 --> 00:38:28,497
Speaker 0: it has something going on.

628
00:38:28,517 --> 00:38:29,260
Speaker 1: No the game.

629
00:38:29,421 --> 00:38:31,180
Speaker 0: This is why the game is why I put it right in the middle.

630
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:40,120
Speaker 1: This is why the game is worse than a five because while you're playing you feel like you're on the cusp of like figuring out Like oh and having a lot of fun, but that never happens because there's nothing to figure.

631
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,066
Speaker 0: That's why it's five.

632
00:38:41,086 --> 00:38:41,629
Speaker 0: you're torn.

633
00:38:41,649 --> 00:38:46,290
Speaker 1: You're torn between greatness and awfulness Thinking oh the game is almost there.

634
00:38:46,310 --> 00:38:49,160
Speaker 1: I must be doing something wrong when really no you're doing everything, right?

635
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:53,915
Speaker 1: You'll be in a situation where you'll all every player will say really that's what happened.

636
00:38:54,297 --> 00:38:55,140
Speaker 1: That doesn't seem right.

637
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,852
Speaker 1: There's no way they'd make the game like that.

638
00:38:56,892 --> 00:38:58,000
Speaker 1: We must have done something wrong.

639
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:00,228
Speaker 1: But the reality is you did everything right.

640
00:39:00,268 --> 00:39:01,292
Speaker 1: the game is just wrong.

641
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:05,028
Speaker 0: a good example of something that's fucked up in the game Is that you know everyone.

642
00:39:05,048 --> 00:39:07,340
Speaker 0: you can have your sex change by accident?

643
00:39:07,962 --> 00:39:13,680
Speaker 0: But the thing is it's nearly impossible to have it change back and you cannot win the game if it is changed.

644
00:39:14,061 --> 00:39:17,314
Speaker 0: So basically having your sex changed means you can't possibly win.

645
00:39:17,595 --> 00:39:19,463
Speaker 1: might as well just walk away from the table And you want to win.

646
00:39:19,543 --> 00:39:21,452
Speaker 0: and it's completely random if it happens.

647
00:39:21,572 --> 00:39:23,259
Speaker 0: It's like not much you can do to control it.

648
00:39:23,823 --> 00:39:24,669
Speaker 0: It's just like oops.

649
00:39:24,709 --> 00:39:26,100
Speaker 0: You met the sex change wizard.

650
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:29,756
Speaker 0: You just happen to draw the sex change wizard card.

651
00:39:29,817 --> 00:39:30,179
Speaker 0: Good job.

652
00:39:31,501 --> 00:39:32,728
Speaker 1: So, I mean that's pretty much it.

653
00:39:32,748 --> 00:39:34,960
Speaker 1: We're gonna cut this a little short because of course we will be at PAX.

654
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:42,579
Speaker 1: So hopefully we'll see you there and we'll see how quickly we resume our normal geek night schedule after PAX because we have Zenka Connor right after.

655
00:39:49,253 --> 00:39:51,790
