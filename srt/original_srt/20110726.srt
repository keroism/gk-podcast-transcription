1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:15,490
Speaker 0: It's July 26 2011 I'm rim and this is geek nights tonight half-minute hero.

2
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,221
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

3
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:30,480
Speaker 0: Oh Man, not going to work all week.

4
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:32,127
Speaker 1: Oh, you're going to work next week.

5
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:34,036
Speaker 0: Yeah next week I got to start my new job.

6
00:00:34,096 --> 00:00:36,569
Speaker 1: Didn't you say you're gonna go to the work once to fill your HRs?

7
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,614
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah on Thursday.

8
00:00:37,654 --> 00:00:40,128
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do some demo stuff but most of it'll be online.

9
00:00:40,672 --> 00:00:41,237
Speaker 1: No, that's good.

10
00:00:41,317 --> 00:00:42,890
Speaker 1: You wanna hear you wanna do some HR bullshit?

11
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,306
Speaker 1: Nah, so, you know, I had a 401k.

12
00:00:46,386 --> 00:00:47,230
Speaker 1: then I had another job.

13
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:49,259
Speaker 0: I had another 401k so I got to sort all that out.

14
00:00:49,279 --> 00:00:51,690
Speaker 0: because I have a 401k from the company.

15
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:52,252
Speaker 0: I just quit.

16
00:00:52,433 --> 00:00:56,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I have a 403 B. I never rolled over from the last company.

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,033
Speaker 0: I was.

18
00:00:57,113 --> 00:00:58,078
Speaker 1: I was in that situation.

19
00:00:58,118 --> 00:00:59,785
Speaker 1: I had two 401ks and two jobs.

20
00:00:59,806 --> 00:01:02,070
Speaker 1: I got a third job So I rolled them both over.

21
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,673
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if I want to go into a 401k with the next company or if I wanted to do my own IRA and Make that my thing forever.

22
00:01:08,316 --> 00:01:10,323
Speaker 1: But anyway, I rolled everything over right?

23
00:01:10,343 --> 00:01:12,410
Speaker 0: I'm sure the gamer listeners are fascinated.

24
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:15,477
Speaker 0: Oh my god, this is what 30 year olds talk.

25
00:01:15,497 --> 00:01:18,586
Speaker 1: So then they closed the 401k and started a new one.

26
00:01:18,626 --> 00:01:19,489
Speaker 1: I'd like roll over.

27
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:30,170
Speaker 1: so Regardless, I got a letter the other day and it was like hey This is from the 401k that completely closed because the company, you know, my where I work now was bought by where I work now.

28
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:38,285
Speaker 1: so, um, I mean where I just anyway, yeah, so They're like, hey the 401k is closing.

29
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:40,640
Speaker 1: if you have any money You're getting a check whether you like it or not.

30
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:42,230
Speaker 1: and I was like I rolled it all over.

31
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,134
Speaker 1: I'll just ignore this letter.

32
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:45,584
Speaker 1: check shows up in the mail for like almost $2,000.

33
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:45,906
Speaker 1: I'm like what?

34
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:48,595
Speaker 1: Did either?

35
00:01:48,635 --> 00:01:50,108
Speaker 1: did somebody give me money or?

36
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:57,927
Speaker 1: Did Somebody not take all the money out even though I told them to I had to roll it over.

37
00:01:57,947 --> 00:01:58,609
Speaker 0: It's hard to say.

38
00:01:59,271 --> 00:02:04,207
Speaker 1: Regardless the check says, you know you get this much money and federal tax withheld zero.

39
00:02:05,212 --> 00:02:11,762
Speaker 1: So I'm looking at this check and I'm like, oh, oh If I just cash this well, it depends.

40
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:13,529
Speaker 0: you're not doing Roth, right?

41
00:02:14,172 --> 00:02:15,581
Speaker 0: No tax as you put in.

42
00:02:15,621 --> 00:02:16,808
Speaker 0: so taking out you don't pay tax.

43
00:02:17,992 --> 00:02:23,658
Speaker 1: Roth is you know, but if you but if I if I This money was in a 401k.

44
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:25,823
Speaker 1: So if you would draw it you pay a penalty.

45
00:02:26,004 --> 00:02:28,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, so this was taken out without penalty.

46
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:30,730
Speaker 1: So if I roll it over to something else, that's fine.

47
00:02:31,232 --> 00:02:33,380
Speaker 1: If I cash this at the bank, I'm pretty sure.

48
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,247
Speaker 1: if I don't pay the penalty.

49
00:02:35,287 --> 00:02:40,113
Speaker 1: No one will notice That's a very illegal but also No one will know.

50
00:02:40,153 --> 00:02:41,156
Speaker 0: here's my advice to you.

51
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:46,780
Speaker 0: Don't talk about this publicly where anyone can hear you And just cash the check.

52
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,030
Speaker 1: No, I'm gonna put it in the other one.

53
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,081
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna go the HR person, but it's like.

54
00:02:50,121 --> 00:02:51,630
Speaker 1: the point is it's like what the fuck?

55
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:56,811
Speaker 1: I told you to take out all the money and move it from A to B and you didn't move all the money or other People.

56
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:58,056
Speaker 1: or did you give me free money?

57
00:02:58,317 --> 00:02:58,860
Speaker 1: What happened?

58
00:02:59,040 --> 00:02:59,824
Speaker 0: That's hard to say.

59
00:03:00,105 --> 00:03:00,406
Speaker 1: I don't know.

60
00:03:00,526 --> 00:03:03,570
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah this week I got nothing to do.

61
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:07,124
Speaker 0: I've been editing some geek nights videos hanging out even though I have a lot to do.

62
00:03:07,165 --> 00:03:08,510
Speaker 1: I've been working sleeping.

63
00:03:08,752 --> 00:03:12,810
Speaker 0: I was playing a game a little while ago called bouldering Mm-hmm, cuz Phil and she air out.

64
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:17,950
Speaker 0: So we were actually, you know doing some rock climbing in Central Park and I've said this before to a lot of our friends.

65
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:19,265
Speaker 0: I haven't really pointed out on the show.

66
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:22,378
Speaker 0: Rock climbing is more game than a sport.

67
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,525
Speaker 0: It's more intellectual than you would think.

68
00:03:24,626 --> 00:03:27,656
Speaker 0: So if any of you nerds out there Don't think you can do it.

69
00:03:27,736 --> 00:03:28,902
Speaker 0: I recommend trying to do it.

70
00:03:28,962 --> 00:03:30,068
Speaker 1: Yeah, like three-year-olds can do it.

71
00:03:30,249 --> 00:03:33,709
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah they can.

72
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:36,579
Speaker 1: So just like they could do jungle gym.

73
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,470
Speaker 1: I bet you can't do a jungle gym as well as a three-year-old.

74
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:41,286
Speaker 0: You know why I can't because my knees hit the ground.

75
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:41,768
Speaker 1: I know.

76
00:03:43,091 --> 00:03:48,230
Speaker 0: So I downloaded, you know, I basically get almost every demo now on the Xbox because it only cost me time.

77
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:50,679
Speaker 1: They only get demos of games that I actually want to.

78
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:54,844
Speaker 0: I get demos of games that I expect to be bad just to see How bad they really are.

79
00:03:54,864 --> 00:04:01,627
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I mean, I got that whatever that new D&D game is and I thought alright What's it gonna be a crappy walk around and hit things game?

80
00:04:01,647 --> 00:04:04,095
Speaker 0: Yep It was like.

81
00:04:04,476 --> 00:04:14,370
Speaker 0: it was amazing to me that despite expecting it to be a crappy walk around and hit things game It didn't even work that well as a crappy walk around and hit things game game.

82
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,254
Speaker 1: See here's the thing is like.

83
00:04:15,354 --> 00:04:18,690
Speaker 1: I've actually been playing a lot of various demos and other games around lately.

84
00:04:18,829 --> 00:04:21,057
Speaker 0: Why is this the season of walk around and hit things?

85
00:04:21,158 --> 00:04:27,788
Speaker 1: and I'm saying almost every game that I've tried out that I you know Turned out to be a walk around and hit things game.

86
00:04:27,829 --> 00:04:32,182
Speaker 1: first I was in the dark spore beta walk around and hit things.

87
00:04:32,242 --> 00:04:35,210
Speaker 1: I tried out Dragon Age 2 demo walk around.

88
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:42,570
Speaker 0: There's more to Dragon Age 2 than just walk around hit things as opposed to say this D&D game That is just walk around and hit things.

89
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:46,269
Speaker 1: That Dragon Age 2 is mostly walk around and hit things.

90
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:48,294
Speaker 1: What was this other one?

91
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:48,897
Speaker 1: I played?

92
00:04:49,017 --> 00:04:50,604
Speaker 1: Oh, it was El Shaddai.

93
00:04:50,724 --> 00:04:51,769
Speaker 1: walk around and hit things.

94
00:04:53,576 --> 00:04:53,806
Speaker 1: Some.

95
00:04:54,772 --> 00:04:55,597
Speaker 1: It wasn't D&D.

96
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:57,890
Speaker 1: It was like some other fantasy thing, but it was walk around and hit things.

97
00:04:57,930 --> 00:05:02,429
Speaker 1: But the one that I played was Bastion which was also walk around and hit things.

98
00:05:02,971 --> 00:05:10,230
Speaker 1: But it had this really clever narration mechanic where basically all it really is is there's things that you do that trigger wave files.

99
00:05:10,291 --> 00:05:11,126
Speaker 1: That's really all it is.

100
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:15,042
Speaker 1: But the narrator was an excellent narrator like the voice actor they got for.

101
00:05:15,062 --> 00:05:19,910
Speaker 1: it does an excellent job like a James Earl Jones Ian High-quality like a Morgan Freeman exactly.

102
00:05:20,377 --> 00:05:24,281
Speaker 1: So it's like for example You start the game and you're laying in bed and you're just sitting there.

103
00:05:24,362 --> 00:05:35,734
Speaker 1: as soon as you move the stick your guy gets up and the narrator at that exact moment says he gets up and It's like you walk around and it's like there's an area where like you, you know, you get a weapon You know.

104
00:05:35,814 --> 00:05:38,586
Speaker 1: and he says oh man, and then he found this something something right.

105
00:05:38,606 --> 00:05:39,590
Speaker 1: and then you go the next area.

106
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,900
Speaker 1: There's a bunch of stuff to smash.

107
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,633
Speaker 1: You don't have to smash it You can just you're

108
00:05:42,653 --> 00:05:43,518
Speaker 0: gonna smash it,

109
00:05:43,699 --> 00:05:56,548
Speaker 1: but if you sit around and smash things long enough It's like, you know, eventually the narrator is like guy just rages for a while Right, and it's like, you know that mechanic kept me going through the demo So I bought it and I played a whole bunch of it.

110
00:05:57,673 --> 00:05:59,720
Speaker 1: The thing is it is walk around and hit things.

111
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,408
Speaker 1: So eventually after like six seven eight levels.

112
00:06:02,428 --> 00:06:10,810
Speaker 0: I'm like Games like that do something cool, but all they have they're one trick pony.

113
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:13,688
Speaker 0: You got like the one cool thing that they innovated and that's it.

114
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:23,819
Speaker 0: then the genius games are gonna be the next games that take the few like really interesting mechanics that people use in these crap games and Actually combine them into a real game.

115
00:06:23,839 --> 00:06:37,049
Speaker 1: that isn't just a cool narrative or isn't just a gimmick Yeah, but yeah, it's cool though because the thing that really surprised me about the clever We called it reactive narration, which is really just triggered wave files that were well scripted to various activities.

116
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,335
Speaker 1: Was that it didn't.

117
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,579
Speaker 1: really it doesn't take that much.

118
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,465
Speaker 1: It's so easy to program right?

119
00:06:42,505 --> 00:06:44,090
Speaker 1: It's all just getting the data, right?

120
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:45,669
Speaker 1: It says it's another thing with clever program.

121
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,370
Speaker 1: It's not like to our fortress where this sort of seemingly really awesome stuff happens because it's a complex system.

122
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:52,237
Speaker 0: it's just as you said.

123
00:06:52,297 --> 00:07:02,990
Speaker 1: seemingly it's just a Wave file played if the player does a certain thing That's all and they just have a lot of wave files tied to a whole lot of events, you know, that could possibly happen.

124
00:07:03,271 --> 00:07:05,990
Speaker 0: It's even easy to do just dynamic music in games.

125
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:12,785
Speaker 0: I mean look at even tribes to had that dynamic looping system where the music would like Ramp up as the action was ramping up around you.

126
00:07:12,865 --> 00:07:13,690
Speaker 0: everyone had different music.

127
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:19,514
Speaker 1: But this is like you'll go into the weapon upgrade shop and you upgrade a weapon and then when you leave based on what weapon You upgrade it.

128
00:07:19,534 --> 00:07:22,789
Speaker 1: He'll say something different that's relevant to that weapon, you know stuff like that.

129
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:29,073
Speaker 0: It's that almost goes along the lines of why I liked old adventure games like quest for glory because half the game was just Like.

130
00:07:29,274 --> 00:07:32,289
Speaker 0: you see something really dangerous and you're like, I wonder how that'll kill me.

131
00:07:32,612 --> 00:07:32,834
Speaker 0: It's like.

132
00:07:33,076 --> 00:07:40,914
Speaker 1: I wonder what he'll say if I do Yeah Imagine if shadow gate which had all the different texts for all the different deaths Which is basically what this had Morgan Freeman Exactly.

133
00:07:41,014 --> 00:07:44,050
Speaker 1: Oh my god the text didn't appear on the screen unless you enabled subtitles.

134
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:48,207
Speaker 0: Oh, we got to get the license to shadow gate and then hire Morgan probably could.

135
00:07:48,247 --> 00:07:52,702
Speaker 1: the last shadow gate I'm was pretty sure with shadow gate 64, which was awful.

136
00:07:52,742 --> 00:07:56,231
Speaker 1: My brother rented it and played a ton of it, but It's it's.

137
00:07:56,753 --> 00:07:59,443
Speaker 1: that is an angry video game nerd fodder if I've ever seen one.

138
00:07:59,603 --> 00:08:00,466
Speaker 0: It might be too bad.

139
00:08:00,747 --> 00:08:01,450
Speaker 1: It's so bad.

140
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:01,931
Speaker 1: It's super.

141
00:08:01,991 --> 00:08:04,377
Speaker 1: it's almost as bad as Superman 64.

142
00:08:04,377 --> 00:08:05,700
Speaker 1: Oh, don't say 64.

143
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:06,242
Speaker 0: Don't say that.

144
00:08:06,282 --> 00:08:07,385
Speaker 0: That's not even like funny.

145
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,299
Speaker 1: shadow gate 64 is so bad You have no idea.

146
00:08:11,319 --> 00:08:12,890
Speaker 1: You should get it played an emulator.

147
00:08:13,131 --> 00:08:23,510
Speaker 0: So the two games that stood out that I was playing demos of one was trenched Which was this kind of like World War one ask fight the aliens that are actually just people in TVs.

148
00:08:24,371 --> 00:08:30,657
Speaker 0: It gets a lot of points for style, but I worry that the game is just tanks tanks tanks Kind of just walk around.

149
00:08:30,697 --> 00:08:33,390
Speaker 0: ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket ticket, you know gate like it has this thing.

150
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:35,604
Speaker 1: Alright, that's the one where you're sort of in the mech thing.

151
00:08:35,624 --> 00:08:40,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's called a trench Yeah, and the enemy is television, which I think we could.

152
00:08:40,188 --> 00:08:45,618
Speaker 0: we dig We jelly with that like that but Jelly means jealous.

153
00:08:45,678 --> 00:08:47,327
Speaker 1: Yeah, jelling as in.

154
00:08:48,131 --> 00:08:50,578
Speaker 0: Anyway, we're jealous of the ability to destroy TV.

155
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:52,944
Speaker 0: They have the chance that we are.

156
00:08:53,145 --> 00:08:58,059
Speaker 1: we do not have the chance and We have a slight chance so credibly incredibly slight.

157
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,230
Speaker 0: We had a better chance when we were young and planning that.

158
00:09:02,853 --> 00:09:04,129
Speaker 0: That's a story for another time.

159
00:09:04,853 --> 00:09:11,890
Speaker 0: But it's one of those games where it has the thing where if you hit each of the shoulder buttons Either your right machine gun or your left machine gun is shooting.

160
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:17,389
Speaker 0: Why would you ever not be holding both of those down it you could?

161
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:22,730
Speaker 1: Theoretically have a game where you could aim them in different directions, right or they have slightly different kinds of ammo.

162
00:09:23,051 --> 00:09:23,855
Speaker 0: I could actually order.

163
00:09:24,096 --> 00:09:26,990
Speaker 0: they spin down or like overheat at the same rate.

164
00:09:27,211 --> 00:09:31,397
Speaker 0: So maybe you let go of one to let it cool down to have a weapon while the other you know Some sort of mechanic.

165
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,250
Speaker 0: It doesn't seem like this game had that.

166
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:34,417
Speaker 1: No, the only there was never.

167
00:09:34,578 --> 00:09:36,570
Speaker 1: I couldn't figure out a reason not to hold both at the same time.

168
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:40,065
Speaker 1: In fact, you know I was messed up and I kind of lost a little bit because I wasn't.

169
00:09:40,186 --> 00:09:41,029
Speaker 1: I didn't realize there were two.

170
00:09:41,871 --> 00:09:44,422
Speaker 1: The thing is I can envision a game that could be pretty cool.

171
00:09:44,442 --> 00:09:46,190
Speaker 1: It should be a stationary shooter.

172
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:50,930
Speaker 1: You don't get to move around Where or maybe you someone else does the moving and you do the shooting?

173
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:59,590
Speaker 1: Where you actually use the left stick to aim the left arm the right stick to aim the right arm and the two triggers to Shoot the two different arms to actually aim in two different places.

174
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,470
Speaker 1: Simultaneous But in this game you can only aim in one spot at a time using only the right stick.

175
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,819
Speaker 1: So there was no reason for that to be separate arms.

176
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:12,430
Speaker 0: That is still such inside baseball that simultaneously.

177
00:10:14,972 --> 00:10:19,530
Speaker 0: But the other one that stood out was Catherine which Scott had mentioned and I just kind of ignored.

178
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:26,699
Speaker 1: I've known about this game for a while and I knew that it was one of those freaky games from Japan That's probably never gonna get released in the US.

179
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:30,201
Speaker 1: But oh my god, this is the one freaky game for Japan That's gonna get released in the US.

180
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:31,209
Speaker 1: I should pay attention to it.

181
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:39,110
Speaker 1: So I actually had it like, you know in the Amazon, you know, not your shopping cart like the saved shopping cart Just to remind, you know.

182
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:45,521
Speaker 1: So every time I bought something the Amazon I would be reminded but it was like 50 60 bucks For this Xbox game and I'd really don't want to buy a disc game.

183
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:50,892
Speaker 1: and then on top of that There's like a collector's box You can get.

184
00:10:50,932 --> 00:10:55,350
Speaker 1: that includes like a pair of boxers and a soundtrack CD and a bunch of ridiculous shit.

185
00:10:55,531 --> 00:10:56,818
Speaker 1: There's some YouTube videos.

186
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:06,680
Speaker 1: You can see where they show you all the ridiculous shit That comes in the goodie box and I you know, so I'm like, I'm curious cuz you know Everyone likes it wouldn't be ridiculous game for Japan gets released in the US.

187
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:08,324
Speaker 1: So the demo came out in the Xbox.

188
00:11:08,344 --> 00:11:08,846
Speaker 1: So I got it.

189
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:16,610
Speaker 0: and Yeah, I just played through enough from the demo to know it has good parts and bad parts.

190
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:25,266
Speaker 0: I was worried because it started out like really like the opening screen with the guy with the little ram's horns like hanging in the Barbed wire and the girl just kind of chillin next to him.

191
00:11:25,286 --> 00:11:25,708
Speaker 0: I was like, huh?

192
00:11:26,711 --> 00:11:29,305
Speaker 0: This is the kind of thing where if it was an anime I would be intrigued.

193
00:11:29,607 --> 00:11:31,376
Speaker 1: yeah exactly It's a very much.

194
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:32,622
Speaker 0: it is an anime in a way.

195
00:11:32,662 --> 00:11:33,265
Speaker 0: It's really like.

196
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,213
Speaker 0: there's a lot of animation in it There's a lot of like.

197
00:11:35,273 --> 00:11:39,850
Speaker 1: it's it's kind of like an interactive and it's very much in the speed graph or genre of anime.

198
00:11:39,991 --> 00:11:46,963
Speaker 0: Yeah, but speed graph or went a little too Still the same genre just it is but better better executed.

199
00:11:47,003 --> 00:11:51,999
Speaker 0: I would say I would say so but Independent of that it was weird because it starts.

200
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,063
Speaker 0: I'm like, alright, what's the deal?

201
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:58,362
Speaker 0: And then I play this weird kind of 3d Surprisingly difficult tower climbing puzzle.

202
00:11:58,382 --> 00:11:59,810
Speaker 1: Well, the first level wasn't difficult.

203
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:03,455
Speaker 0: No, the second level was difficult though But it's not that it was difficult.

204
00:12:03,475 --> 00:12:08,430
Speaker 1: is that you could see how the as the puzzles could easily get more difficult and challenging.

205
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,399
Speaker 0: Yes, that I couldn't just blow through it.

206
00:12:10,419 --> 00:12:12,589
Speaker 0: I had to actually like, uh, okay do this.

207
00:12:13,213 --> 00:12:19,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like there were parts, you know, it was like yeah, you know The boxes will will not fall down as long as they're touching by a corner and I'm like, that's great.

208
00:12:19,851 --> 00:12:24,619
Speaker 1: But it actually took a little while to figure out How to actually get the blocks into that configuration.

209
00:12:24,659 --> 00:12:27,108
Speaker 1: never mind do it quick even though I was trying to.

210
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:29,801
Speaker 1: you know I was actively trying to figure out how that worked.

211
00:12:30,223 --> 00:12:31,630
Speaker 1: It's like oh you can make a staircase.

212
00:12:31,630 --> 00:12:33,642
Speaker 1: It's not supported by anything at all.

213
00:12:33,662 --> 00:12:34,889
Speaker 1: I was like that's the way to go.

214
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,884
Speaker 0: But then after that ends I'm playing through that.

215
00:12:37,945 --> 00:12:43,732
Speaker 0: at first I'm like, alright It's some crappy like okay puzzle platformer that has like a weird plot around it whatever.

216
00:12:44,134 --> 00:12:46,769
Speaker 0: people often cover up a mediocre game with a plot.

217
00:12:46,789 --> 00:12:56,744
Speaker 0: and Then I got to the other part kind of like gameplay where you just hang out with your friends and get text messages from your girlfriend and Respond to them.

218
00:12:57,028 --> 00:12:58,793
Speaker 1: Yeah it's like the plot part is?

219
00:12:59,074 --> 00:12:59,575
Speaker 1: it's not like.

220
00:12:59,615 --> 00:13:06,166
Speaker 1: it's not as good as say half-life where the plot and The game are integrated or portal to write where they're intertwined.

221
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:07,170
Speaker 1: They're the same thing, right?

222
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:13,349
Speaker 1: This is like you do a puzzle game when you're sleeping and then when you're awake You go to the bar and you play this plot game.

223
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:18,707
Speaker 1: But the plot game actually had some interesting stuff that wasn't necessarily straightforward.

224
00:13:18,807 --> 00:13:22,230
Speaker 1: take for example Those Knights of the Old Republic Star Wars games, right?

225
00:13:23,032 --> 00:13:27,290
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bought one of them cheap on Steam because they were so talked about and I'm not a fan.

226
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:32,809
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know That's those are the ones you talk to people and depending on what you say and what quest you do you be.

227
00:13:33,051 --> 00:13:37,105
Speaker 1: You know dark side or light side those games have potential but never really every.

228
00:13:37,226 --> 00:13:40,963
Speaker 1: everything you really do It's same as fallout 3 right everything you do.

229
00:13:41,044 --> 00:13:42,270
Speaker 1: It's sort of like just obvious.

230
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:48,450
Speaker 1: There's a dark side choice a light side choice and sort of a weird choice sometimes and that's it in this.

231
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:53,530
Speaker 1: It's like you weren't always sure what the choice you were making was leaning towards.

232
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:54,435
Speaker 1: It's like you.

233
00:13:54,475 --> 00:13:56,224
Speaker 1: there was this really quick good system.

234
00:13:56,305 --> 00:13:57,189
Speaker 1: remain text messages.

235
00:13:57,531 --> 00:14:00,270
Speaker 1: We push a and he'd write a line of the text message.

236
00:14:00,410 --> 00:14:07,710
Speaker 1: it's very it's Phoenix Wright style and you could either keep that line that he wrote or Erase it and press a again to get a different choice.

237
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:10,450
Speaker 1: And so basically you press a B a B a B to see all the choices.

238
00:14:10,912 --> 00:14:13,525
Speaker 1: But it's like, you know you text someone.

239
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:17,502
Speaker 1: it's like hey, baby What's up, or how are you doing?

240
00:14:17,522 --> 00:14:18,528
Speaker 1: And those are your three choices.

241
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:26,812
Speaker 1: and you're like Okay, and then the next choice is like, you know the girl then the text you back and she's like Where are you?

242
00:14:26,933 --> 00:14:30,689
Speaker 1: and it's like you can see one of the choices of the truth at the bar drinking.

243
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:37,490
Speaker 1: I'm at home at a movie, you know at work and it's like it's like which one do you choose?

244
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:42,650
Speaker 0: Also, what are you going for like, I don't know if I wanted to be good or bad.

245
00:14:42,771 --> 00:14:44,950
Speaker 1: It's like you don't even know which choice was good or bad.

246
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:52,428
Speaker 1: I mean obviously lying is probably worse than the truth But maybe not because where you are is not where she might want you to be.

247
00:14:52,448 --> 00:14:55,321
Speaker 1: It's like It's awesome and you didn't choose to be there.

248
00:14:55,381 --> 00:14:57,190
Speaker 1: It's like you don't get to control the whole plot.

249
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:05,249
Speaker 1: It's like you're at the bar drink and there's a kind of like dream murder plot going on And it's obviously a metaphor about just you know commitment.

250
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,281
Speaker 1: Yes And whatever.

251
00:15:07,342 --> 00:15:08,710
Speaker 0: but I love the artistic style.

252
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:14,232
Speaker 0: I love how he's got the little horns and all the other sheep are there dying around him through this like dream And

253
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:18,769
Speaker 1: the sheep is egging him on and like the hands are coming up from below to pull him into the yeah

254
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:25,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, and the second tower it's the girl and then there's that other girl and I think I'm gonna buy it.

255
00:15:25,971 --> 00:15:27,883
Speaker 1: All right, let's you get a bite on disc.

256
00:15:28,587 --> 00:15:28,990
Speaker 1: I don't know.

257
00:15:29,231 --> 00:15:32,350
Speaker 1: I think you know because if you buy it on disc you can just give it to me when you're done with it.

258
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:35,250
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I guess I could and save me 60 bucks.

259
00:15:35,832 --> 00:15:36,094
Speaker 0: I don't know.

260
00:15:36,175 --> 00:15:36,940
Speaker 0: It's intriguing.

261
00:15:36,960 --> 00:15:37,443
Speaker 1: you can buy that.

262
00:15:37,463 --> 00:15:38,430
Speaker 1: you could buy the expensive one.

263
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:46,994
Speaker 0: I'll say this of all the games we've talked about recently if you've got an Xbox just grab the demo of Catherine and Just check it out.

264
00:15:47,074 --> 00:15:53,316
Speaker 1: I want you to you know, I think it'll be on the ps3 - maybe I'm not sure if I like it I'm just interested.

265
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:55,826
Speaker 1: I just want to see people buy it to prove to Japan.

266
00:15:55,847 --> 00:15:58,790
Speaker 1: yet again We fucking buy your games bitches.

267
00:15:59,051 --> 00:16:03,670
Speaker 1: There's no reason that every single game you make shouldn't be released in one to the second look from both me and Scott.

268
00:16:03,892 --> 00:16:04,781
Speaker 0: How rare is that?

269
00:16:05,327 --> 00:16:16,033
Speaker 1: Yeah So, you know when I was in sixth grade sixth grade which you were like 10 or 11 I was 11 12, right.

270
00:16:16,053 --> 00:16:20,036
Speaker 1: so There was this school.

271
00:16:20,137 --> 00:16:32,510
Speaker 1: basically every year the middle school did a magazine drive Which is basically go sell magazine subscriptions to all your family and friends and neighbors To get money for the school to do shit like keep the band around and whatever, right?

272
00:16:33,932 --> 00:16:35,670
Speaker 1: So I all I did was I said, huh?

273
00:16:35,771 --> 00:16:37,250
Speaker 1: These are cheap magazines descriptions.

274
00:16:37,411 --> 00:16:42,387
Speaker 1: So I got a search in a game pro and I kept that subscription through when I was at our IT.

275
00:16:43,411 --> 00:16:46,651
Speaker 0: Wow, I think I kept Nintendo power from 1 to 200.

276
00:16:46,651 --> 00:16:49,183
Speaker 1: I think I canceled it in like 2001 or 2 or something.

277
00:16:49,223 --> 00:16:53,190
Speaker 0: my brother kept Nintendo power But I gave up because I had the internet and I was playing PC games.

278
00:16:53,812 --> 00:16:57,347
Speaker 1: And you know, you can say whatever you want about game pro that pros and cons.

279
00:16:57,508 --> 00:17:00,229
Speaker 0: over the years It was no PC gamer game for it was like the weakest.

280
00:17:00,530 --> 00:17:02,898
Speaker 1: I bought some game of PC gamers in my day as well.

281
00:17:03,158 --> 00:17:05,946
Speaker 0: I subscribed once to PC gamer the whole year.

282
00:17:06,007 --> 00:17:07,089
Speaker 0: That was awesome.

283
00:17:07,109 --> 00:17:11,790
Speaker 0: I subscribed to computer shopper free cuz it came with those CDs or those floppies with games.

284
00:17:11,990 --> 00:17:13,996
Speaker 0: I know Raptor Call of the Shadows.

285
00:17:14,096 --> 00:17:14,698
Speaker 0: one must fall 2097.

286
00:17:14,698 --> 00:17:15,378
Speaker 0: Oh shit, son.

287
00:17:15,619 --> 00:17:16,683
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

288
00:17:17,605 --> 00:17:23,115
Speaker 0: I would just oh my god that There's something for our packs panel Just to bring those games up.

289
00:17:24,058 --> 00:17:25,040
Speaker 1: I'm sure people know about those.

290
00:17:25,222 --> 00:17:27,027
Speaker 0: I don't think people do anyway.

291
00:17:27,047 --> 00:17:33,930
Speaker 1: the So so I you know, I was there when the scary Larry days by the way, he now works at Nintendo for Pokemon.

292
00:17:34,111 --> 00:17:36,864
Speaker 1: He works a Pokemon not for Nintendo, which I guess is sort of work.

293
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:37,829
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter, right?

294
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:42,988
Speaker 1: So, you know game pro after it was really sucky when I got rid of it in o2.

295
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:47,020
Speaker 1: That was like the doldrums and you know by then internet had taken over.

296
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,404
Speaker 1: video game magazines are dead.

297
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:50,510
Speaker 1: Kotaku joystick destroy them.

298
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:51,858
Speaker 1: There's no reason then to exist.

299
00:17:51,939 --> 00:18:02,935
Speaker 1: but just today Game pro announced something interesting which Sort of almost makes me want to subscribe Which is really weird.

300
00:18:03,477 --> 00:18:07,907
Speaker 1: and basically what they're doing is they're going to become a quarterly magazine.

301
00:18:07,927 --> 00:18:12,590
Speaker 1: Oh So they'll only be four game pros a year.

302
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:21,690
Speaker 1: But if they're more if they if they do what the escapist should have been right, but it's gonna be 50 pages bigger Right and it's gonna be 10 bucks.

303
00:18:22,412 --> 00:18:26,124
Speaker 1: So maybe I think I might buy the first one of these on the newsstand.

304
00:18:26,144 --> 00:18:26,947
Speaker 0: just they do.

305
00:18:26,987 --> 00:18:30,078
Speaker 0: I don't want review I want like expert commentary.

306
00:18:30,138 --> 00:18:33,570
Speaker 0: I want like what Daryl and Mike and all them do with their magazine.

307
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:39,081
Speaker 1: They can make a really highbrow gaming magazine.

308
00:18:39,122 --> 00:18:44,159
Speaker 1: that isn't you know, it's like look you're a magazine you're on print You can't get up-to-date news.

309
00:18:44,521 --> 00:18:46,590
Speaker 1: You can't beat the blogs in terms of speed.

310
00:18:47,051 --> 00:18:50,260
Speaker 1: But if you can beat them in content maybe.

311
00:18:50,821 --> 00:18:58,721
Speaker 0: and if you take maybe if you telly look at the state of video game journalism Stick at a piece of paper with ink on it and beat them.

312
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:06,644
Speaker 1: if you take three months to put you know something That's only 15% bigger than what you normally do in one month, right?

313
00:19:06,985 --> 00:19:10,869
Speaker 1: So if they did it 300% bigger So it was three times as big as a normal game Pro.

314
00:19:11,353 --> 00:19:13,510
Speaker 1: It would be the same quality you imagine as a normal game pro.

315
00:19:13,751 --> 00:19:19,790
Speaker 1: They're only making it slightly percentage-wise bigger than an existing game pro and they're putting three months of effort into it.

316
00:19:19,850 --> 00:19:28,170
Speaker 0: So it should be at least twice as good as game pro is now Like when those geek nights guys switch to two episodes a week instead of four.

317
00:19:28,411 --> 00:19:36,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the other thing is game pro unlike say game informer, which is owned by Gamestop or other Any other magazines still exist?

318
00:19:36,235 --> 00:19:46,470
Speaker 1: I don't even know, you know isn't you know directly tied to some other evil entity Even though I'm pretty sure there's plenty of bullshit, you know where companies pay for better review scores and all that crap?

319
00:19:46,971 --> 00:19:53,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, what would sell me a hundred percent is if they got rid of all scores and just had essay reviews on everything.

320
00:19:53,871 --> 00:19:58,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, they should just you know team up with like escapist or something to produce this quarterly or it's you know.

321
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:01,579
Speaker 1: Just if it's it could potentially be good.

322
00:20:01,639 --> 00:20:02,582
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna check it out.

323
00:20:02,662 --> 00:20:05,109
Speaker 1: I'm gonna get the first one on the newsstands.

324
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:08,230
Speaker 0: good What is this surprising wave of optimism on geek nights?

325
00:20:08,612 --> 00:20:13,375
Speaker 0: Oh this new Catherine game might be worth looking at this magazine I might look at.

326
00:20:13,455 --> 00:20:14,198
Speaker 1: cuz we're still.

327
00:20:14,218 --> 00:20:15,643
Speaker 1: we're still hesitant.

328
00:20:16,005 --> 00:20:19,374
Speaker 1: when when we're saying dude This shit is awesome Then you can then you can.

329
00:20:19,414 --> 00:20:25,669
Speaker 0: what was the last thing we said that about except portal to portal to before that portal?

330
00:20:29,784 --> 00:20:31,179
Speaker 1: Yep, let me check the archive.

331
00:20:31,682 --> 00:20:36,720
Speaker 0: So we at least have to talk a little bit about the fact that EA bought PopCap for like over a billion dollars.

332
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,857
Speaker 0: Yeah Why?

333
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:40,021
Speaker 0: What?

334
00:20:40,403 --> 00:20:42,794
Speaker 0: well, I don't even understand like that came out of nowhere.

335
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:49,580
Speaker 0: I'm sure if I'd been paying attention Maybe we could have seen it coming, but I ignore EA and I definitely ignore PopCap.

336
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,870
Speaker 1: Apparently Zynga wanted to buy a PopCap and got turned down.

337
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:55,354
Speaker 0: I could see that.

338
00:20:55,374 --> 00:20:59,325
Speaker 0: I wonder if Zynga lowballed though I don't like Zynga.

339
00:20:59,425 --> 00:21:00,589
Speaker 0: I think Zynga is bad.

340
00:21:00,609 --> 00:21:02,115
Speaker 1: Yeah, we like battle line.

341
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,198
Speaker 1: That was the last thing we said.

342
00:21:03,239 --> 00:21:03,580
Speaker 1: good things.

343
00:21:05,341 --> 00:21:14,020
Speaker 1: Anyway Yeah, so it's like, you know The thing is it's kind of weird because EA is gigantic company and they make these gigantic games that sell a ton of copies.

344
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:20,680
Speaker 0: I think they've realized that the big blockbuster high-budget game is at least for the near term.

345
00:21:20,761 --> 00:21:23,220
Speaker 0: I think that's gonna be on a huge downward spiral, right?

346
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,420
Speaker 1: But it's like look how much money EA makes off Madden.

347
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:30,956
Speaker 1: Compare that to how much money PopCap made off of peggle peggle probably made.

348
00:21:30,976 --> 00:21:33,003
Speaker 1: I don't have numbers I'm just guessing.

349
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:42,108
Speaker 1: it probably made more money because it cost nothing to make exactly right it, you know It was so cheap to make peggle So afraid of a jillion of them for like a dollar.

350
00:21:42,168 --> 00:21:47,595
Speaker 0: the people who aren't Self-identified invested gamers aren't gonna be 50 bucks.

351
00:21:48,057 --> 00:21:55,409
Speaker 0: the peggle It's in and Zynga wouldn't really have been a good fit because I think it doesn't make games.

352
00:21:55,429 --> 00:22:00,257
Speaker 0: I Actually, honestly, I kind of want to do a panel of the next packs called Zynga doesn't make games.

353
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:05,872
Speaker 0: Oh shit That would be the most I don't know inflammatory we've ever gone.

354
00:22:06,253 --> 00:22:09,140
Speaker 1: you can't target a specific anyway, but they are the worst.

355
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:10,012
Speaker 0: They're the most evil.

356
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:12,974
Speaker 1: They are Anyway, but PopCap isn't evil.

357
00:22:13,136 --> 00:22:13,700
Speaker 0: I can't call them.

358
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:17,760
Speaker 1: I actually have a lot of pocket games on my phone because I bought them when they were on sale and they're kind of good.

359
00:22:17,941 --> 00:22:21,760
Speaker 1: They're good at what thank you birds is still better than their games, but it's in the same kind of genre.

360
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:25,751
Speaker 0: Yeah We got to wait for a Rovio to make Different games that aren't just for birds and stuff.

361
00:22:25,792 --> 00:22:32,784
Speaker 1: actually the best game peggle hat PopCap has is the the bookworm adventuring one About bookworm.

362
00:22:32,864 --> 00:22:37,442
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have bookworm they you know, they have the rest of a bookworm at RIT The original.

363
00:22:37,522 --> 00:22:40,633
Speaker 1: the stupidest one they have is I think the aquarium.

364
00:22:40,833 --> 00:22:45,242
Speaker 1: do they do the aquarium one and say I got to check their Website, I don't even that's a game We're literally.

365
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:50,480
Speaker 1: all you do is upgrade the aquarium and then you upgrade the aquarium in order to upgrade the aquarium.

366
00:22:50,923 --> 00:22:52,655
Speaker 1: Oh, and they have the plans for zombies.

367
00:22:52,675 --> 00:22:53,058
Speaker 1: isn't bad?

368
00:22:54,062 --> 00:22:55,366
Speaker 1: That's not really.

369
00:22:55,386 --> 00:22:57,993
Speaker 0: I don't understand what EA wants with PopCap.

370
00:22:58,395 --> 00:23:01,491
Speaker 0: unless they go into that market They don't own bejeweled.

371
00:23:01,532 --> 00:23:02,440
Speaker 1: Of course, they make all their money.

372
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:04,807
Speaker 0: I mean, my guess is that they don't have like in-house.

373
00:23:04,948 --> 00:23:09,080
Speaker 0: some executive was like we don't have any inroads into that light casual gaming.

374
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,447
Speaker 0: We got to get something.

375
00:23:11,150 --> 00:23:13,120
Speaker 1: Well, you also got to think of it long term, right?

376
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:19,520
Speaker 1: You know, even if you know, you know EA could easily just make its own games in that genre and do the same business model.

377
00:23:19,621 --> 00:23:20,186
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's that's.

378
00:23:20,287 --> 00:23:21,640
Speaker 1: they don't need PopCap to do that.

379
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:28,720
Speaker 1: What they do it though is PopCap has a proven track record of making multiple successful games in that genre, right?

380
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:35,310
Speaker 1: So they're buying basically the talent that made peggle Zuma, you know What all these?

381
00:23:35,411 --> 00:23:36,339
Speaker 1: you know all these games?

382
00:23:39,001 --> 00:23:45,059
Speaker 1: Own those people any games that those people make in the future if they're as successful as plans for zombies, etc.

383
00:23:45,905 --> 00:23:47,438
Speaker 1: EA will make all the monies on that.

384
00:23:47,499 --> 00:23:48,707
Speaker 0: now I'm wondering if they're cuz the.

385
00:23:48,847 --> 00:23:54,880
Speaker 0: I don't know how much the money would matter to them Especially because they're paying a billion dollars for they need the money cuz I think weren't there.

386
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:55,404
Speaker 1: I don't know.

387
00:23:55,465 --> 00:23:57,280
Speaker 1: I didn't check their numbers, but I think they're down.

388
00:23:57,702 --> 00:23:59,128
Speaker 1: I don't think they're doing as well as they were.

389
00:23:59,631 --> 00:24:03,087
Speaker 1: so I mean if PopCaps on the way up They could boost the bottom line.

390
00:24:03,147 --> 00:24:05,680
Speaker 0: my money's in take two, but that's a separate thing.

391
00:24:06,506 --> 00:24:15,073
Speaker 0: but with EA I wonder if the real goal in the end is to Leverage popular cheap games like this.

392
00:24:15,334 --> 00:24:16,680
Speaker 0: They'll make money which is fine.

393
00:24:17,242 --> 00:24:24,786
Speaker 0: I think they're gonna try to use that sort of thing to feed into their big games with either micro transactions or oh You get a goodie.

394
00:24:24,866 --> 00:24:27,740
Speaker 0: if you play this PopCap like this little version like this.

395
00:24:27,941 --> 00:24:35,988
Speaker 0: I don't know a Major League Baseball like home run contest that they make the PopCap guys make and then oh if you've as you Level up in this you get goodies in the current.

396
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:45,867
Speaker 1: There definitely is a lot of possibilities for integrating the Various PopCap games with the EA games and I think especially Right.

397
00:24:47,181 --> 00:24:51,980
Speaker 1: EA has made a bunch of mobile games, but they haven't been nearly as successful as the PopCap ones.

398
00:24:52,182 --> 00:24:54,280
Speaker 1: So for example, there is a mobile Madden.

399
00:24:55,461 --> 00:24:56,304
Speaker 1: Good luck with that shit.

400
00:24:56,966 --> 00:25:01,560
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, EA is looking into subscription services for their sports games.

401
00:25:02,942 --> 00:25:13,200
Speaker 0: I saw an article about that which is pretty much about time because that they already have a Subscription model except for the fact that a lot of people are more and more okay with having a game from two years ago.

402
00:25:13,923 --> 00:25:17,420
Speaker 0: Only the people who are nerds about they need to have the most up-to-date roster.

403
00:25:18,002 --> 00:25:20,771
Speaker 0: Only people who care about sports and video games care.

404
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:22,858
Speaker 1: Well, there's people who actually care about sports.

405
00:25:22,878 --> 00:25:27,900
Speaker 0: video games Yeah, but I believe most of those people care to a degree about sports.

406
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,697
Speaker 0: They want the game to match the current rosters because they care about that sort of thing.

407
00:25:32,998 --> 00:25:36,358
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And a subscription model prevents the prop.

408
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:39,457
Speaker 0: basically It'll get all the casual people who like play a Madden every now and then.

409
00:25:40,221 --> 00:25:48,057
Speaker 0: They're probably more likely to subscribe if the price is low enough than they are to Buy more than one Madden game every several years.

410
00:25:48,359 --> 00:25:51,236
Speaker 1: Yep So I just want to point out we're talking about PopCap.

411
00:25:51,497 --> 00:25:55,700
Speaker 1: the Make-A-Wish Foundation sent some kid over to PopCap because his wish was to make a video game.

412
00:25:56,282 --> 00:26:02,347
Speaker 1: He had the game all designed out and shit and the PopCap people made it and it's free on the App Store The iPhone iPad.

413
00:26:02,407 --> 00:26:05,180
Speaker 1: I did not know that the game is called Allied star police.

414
00:26:05,361 --> 00:26:11,540
Speaker 1: It's oh, it's you know, it is sort of a full game But it really only has you just play the same thing on three difficulties and then it's done.

415
00:26:11,841 --> 00:26:16,257
Speaker 1: It's not big but it's free and the way it works is sort of like a real.

416
00:26:16,297 --> 00:26:17,160
Speaker 1: it's actually pretty good.

417
00:26:17,422 --> 00:26:17,583
Speaker 1: It's.

418
00:26:18,189 --> 00:26:20,686
Speaker 1: it's like amazingly good For what it is.

419
00:26:20,706 --> 00:26:27,740
Speaker 1: So the way it works is it's sort of like plans for zombies But it's real time plans for zombies.

420
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:37,300
Speaker 1: So there's four columns and bad guys start coming down the columns and in real time You have to send tanks and different vehicles.

421
00:26:37,602 --> 00:26:41,080
Speaker 1: You spend money to buy them and send them down the different columns and they move.

422
00:26:41,301 --> 00:26:45,080
Speaker 1: So you it's like in plans for zombies you sit still while the zombies come at you.

423
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:47,220
Speaker 1: This is more like if it were zombies for zombies.

424
00:26:47,561 --> 00:26:58,740
Speaker 1: So you're sending guys down the four columns and they're sending guys at you and as you kill their guys You get more money and you send more guys But your guys die and then you just send more guys to replace them and you have to destroy the other guys fort.

425
00:26:59,162 --> 00:27:04,260
Speaker 1: So I beat it on the first try and all three difficulties and you're supposed to just keep playing the same thing over and over.

426
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:13,991
Speaker 1: We're gonna take a high score, but this is a pretty good game for some kid designed it and You know dad PopCap made it out of charity.

427
00:27:14,052 --> 00:27:16,160
Speaker 0: Well that dynamic miss - that's what we always say.

428
00:27:16,521 --> 00:27:19,111
Speaker 0: No one's really made a good versus tower defense.

429
00:27:19,452 --> 00:27:22,395
Speaker 1: This is definitely a. it's not versus No, but it's a computer.

430
00:27:23,101 --> 00:27:31,093
Speaker 0: I feel like the active participate like the way you play is more down the line of going that direction toward Straight up to towers versus each other.

431
00:27:31,113 --> 00:27:35,179
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, this is a you know, you should try it out because it's free.

432
00:27:35,199 --> 00:27:41,640
Speaker 1: and Actually, if you look here, it's kind of funny going iTunes and like almost every review on iTunes is like five stars.

433
00:27:48,391 --> 00:27:52,667
Speaker 0: So things of the day, I want to go back to my roots on things of the day.

434
00:27:53,048 --> 00:27:57,170
Speaker 0: college humor Basically more words that I realized I like things of the day.

435
00:27:57,211 --> 00:28:06,449
Speaker 0: They're interesting But a lot of times we'll be sitting like an out with the TV with a bunch of friends over and I need you know We need entertainment something to show them because the internet is TV now.

436
00:28:07,053 --> 00:28:08,221
Speaker 0: So I'm like, alright I go to.

437
00:28:08,241 --> 00:28:13,729
Speaker 0: I always used to go to you know The geeknight site and just go through like all the old things of the day because it was usually funny videos of shit.

438
00:28:14,551 --> 00:28:22,409
Speaker 0: But a lot lately I've been using a lot more articles or things that are really interesting But they're not something I could like show someone on a TV.

439
00:28:23,371 --> 00:28:28,809
Speaker 0: So for the next like several episodes, I'm gonna try to use things that someone could show someone else on a TV.

440
00:28:28,829 --> 00:28:33,622
Speaker 0: and I've had dogs in other words funny cat videos dogs in this case.

441
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:35,730
Speaker 0: I had dogs my whole life till I went to college.

442
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:37,796
Speaker 0: I love dogs and dogs are smart.

443
00:28:38,218 --> 00:28:47,408
Speaker 1: This bulldog is a college humor video or they appear to be smart But really they're just acting in a way that appears smart by random chance in the same way that people do.

444
00:28:47,548 --> 00:28:54,937
Speaker 0: Yes So this bulldog and his bulldog compatriot Really like the outdoor pool because it's hot.

445
00:28:55,178 --> 00:28:56,563
Speaker 1: Well, it's just a plastic kiddie pool.

446
00:28:56,603 --> 00:28:57,887
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's great.

447
00:28:58,048 --> 00:29:00,055
Speaker 0: If you're a dog Well, of course, it's dog size.

448
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:01,843
Speaker 1: So it's like an Olympic dog pool.

449
00:29:02,104 --> 00:29:03,630
Speaker 0: They have a brilliant idea.

450
00:29:04,111 --> 00:29:06,316
Speaker 0: This pool is awesome, but it is hot outside.

451
00:29:06,818 --> 00:29:14,120
Speaker 0: What if we bring the pool inside and the video is them attempting to Pull off this master plan.

452
00:29:14,201 --> 00:29:14,885
Speaker 0: It's adorable.

453
00:29:14,905 --> 00:29:27,603
Speaker 1: Okay So I'm just gonna read the text straight from this website Which actually happens to be crunchyroll even though what I find strange is a crunchyroll I guess is the crunchyroll news posted this video with a YouTube in bed.

454
00:29:27,644 --> 00:29:27,864
Speaker 1: It's like.

Speaker 0: I'm excited cuz I'm a huge fan of our virtual idols.

469
00:30:30,651 --> 00:30:34,844
Speaker 0: This is unbelievably good as long as they don't go all super macross on us.

470
00:30:34,884 --> 00:30:35,626
Speaker 1: You have no idea.

Speaker 1: This is unbelievably good.

472
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:42,910
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, we are going to be at the penny arcade Expo doing a one panel at noon on Saturday.

00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,903
Speaker 0: Alert or discover the Forgotten Masters.

474
00:30:47,305 --> 00:30:53,666
Speaker 0: I don't want to say I know this one's discover as opposed to the other one which was steel which is separate and special.

475
00:30:53,686 --> 00:30:56,570
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm this one One piece of it.

476
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:57,434
Speaker 0: I won't spoil the rest.

477
00:30:57,494 --> 00:31:04,241
Speaker 0: Scott and I are gonna play outlaw in front of the audience as we comment on outlaw Which I think is all you bring in the Atari out there one of the.

478
00:31:04,523 --> 00:31:08,110
Speaker 1: it's all you making it work at the projector one Of the better design games out there.

479
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:14,430
Speaker 0: I know that I currently hold the geek nights championship belt for outlaw because Scott could not win it.

480
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:15,855
Speaker 1: I only lost by like one bullet.

481
00:31:16,095 --> 00:31:17,279
Speaker 0: Yeah one bullet.

482
00:31:17,359 --> 00:31:18,002
Speaker 0: It's all it takes.

483
00:31:18,122 --> 00:31:20,510
Speaker 1: Oh you shut up since you're not going to work.

484
00:31:21,272 --> 00:31:23,089
Speaker 1: You can try to get an Atari emulator to work.

485
00:31:23,355 --> 00:31:30,648
Speaker 0: It's fine Just in case the bringing the Atari proves to you just want an emulator because you want to practice to try and take the belt Away, but there's no chance.

486
00:31:32,511 --> 00:31:41,769
Speaker 0: Also in the meta moment, I'll let you know that because I have this week off I've been feverishly editing all the archival video I've got so two more of our panels are gonna go up.

487
00:31:42,471 --> 00:31:43,537
Speaker 0: Uncle yo stand up.

488
00:31:43,617 --> 00:31:50,406
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get up in our channel as soon as I put together on his channel Because our channel no longer has time restrictions like with the whole thing up in one video.

489
00:31:50,426 --> 00:31:50,807
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

490
00:31:51,088 --> 00:31:53,356
Speaker 0: Yeah That's pretty much it.

491
00:31:53,376 --> 00:31:54,021
Speaker 0: That's what I'm working.

492
00:31:54,041 --> 00:31:56,735
Speaker 1: I've been working on Upgrading front recruit.

493
00:31:56,775 --> 00:31:57,959
Speaker 1: calm significantly.

494
00:31:57,979 --> 00:32:00,106
Speaker 1: I'm doing a lot of stuff to upgrade it.

495
00:32:00,146 --> 00:32:01,470
Speaker 1: You can read about it in the forum.

496
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,268
Speaker 0: It's pretty exciting.

497
00:32:03,351 --> 00:32:03,733
Speaker 1: If you can.

498
00:32:03,813 --> 00:32:07,930
Speaker 1: also right now the best thing you can do is if you're a Facebook person.

499
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:09,679
Speaker 1: We have a Facebook page.

500
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:10,564
Speaker 1: is facebook.com.

501
00:32:10,584 --> 00:32:11,730
Speaker 1: slash front recruit gasp.

502
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:27,930
Speaker 1: Eventually once this new site goes up, which hopefully will be before packs, but maybe not depending but hopefully will be It will automatically post everything that we do to that Facebook page every day in a very high class and professional way.

503
00:32:28,512 --> 00:32:33,310
Speaker 1: So you could actually I basically gave up and trying to get people to come to front recruit calm.

504
00:32:33,732 --> 00:32:38,761
Speaker 1: So it's like I'm gonna make the website itself as rich as possible Like everything's gonna be there, but you know what why?

505
00:32:38,841 --> 00:32:41,795
Speaker 1: you know, if someone doesn't want to come to our website Why should I inconvenience them?

506
00:32:41,815 --> 00:32:42,940
Speaker 0: because we don't have ads.

507
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:44,889
Speaker 0: so it's not like we need people to come.

508
00:32:44,909 --> 00:32:45,693
Speaker 0: in fact It's better.

509
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:48,308
Speaker 0: if you don't come I'm just gonna and I'm just gonna take.

510
00:32:48,389 --> 00:32:54,394
Speaker 1: you know The only reason now, you know It's not like I actually wanted people to come for any reason other than I put all this work into it and no one sees It right.

511
00:32:54,454 --> 00:32:55,802
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna be so you know who sees it.

512
00:32:56,104 --> 00:32:57,954
Speaker 0: every time we get a new listener You're a con.

513
00:32:58,255 --> 00:33:01,570
Speaker 0: they wonder, you know, who the fuck were those guys trashing my dota game?

514
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:03,904
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and they go online the Google for geek knives.

515
00:33:03,925 --> 00:33:04,548
Speaker 0: They find the website.

516
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:04,750
Speaker 0: they go.

517
00:33:04,911 --> 00:33:08,450
Speaker 0: Oh, those guys are some handsome individuals and I will listen to what they have to say.

518
00:33:08,891 --> 00:33:11,952
Speaker 1: It's there's gonna be a lot of fancy shit In general.

519
00:33:12,173 --> 00:33:15,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we ran what happened to the book club.

520
00:33:15,063 --> 00:33:16,830
Speaker 0: Uh, we didn't do it last week.

521
00:33:17,751 --> 00:33:18,494
Speaker 0: Cuz we're lazy.

522
00:33:18,715 --> 00:33:20,122
Speaker 0: We both read foundation.

523
00:33:20,162 --> 00:33:21,548
Speaker 0: We'll record it this week and put it up.

524
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,163
Speaker 0: And you got to do the data entry on the book club for your book.

525
00:33:26,243 --> 00:33:30,556
Speaker 1: We also didn't do the data entry for Like the past one or two.

526
00:33:30,938 --> 00:33:31,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

527
00:33:31,903 --> 00:33:32,325
Speaker 0: We can do it.

528
00:33:32,405 --> 00:33:33,309
Speaker 1: I did all the other ones.

529
00:33:33,551 --> 00:33:35,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of them are in there.

530
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:40,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, where no one can see them yet, but you will see them zoom The book club is splitting off into its own thing the geek nights book club.

531
00:33:40,511 --> 00:33:45,390
Speaker 0: So we'll try to do them at least once a month and they won't take up Thursday episodes Which means we need Thursday episode.

532
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:55,301
Speaker 0: I do and I'm cutting all the audio of the book club out of the old Thursday episodes where there's all that like news and Crap in it so you can listen to just the book club.

533
00:33:55,341 --> 00:33:56,043
Speaker 0: book club.

534
00:33:56,063 --> 00:33:58,110
Speaker 1: I got to figure out how we're actually gonna post those.

535
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:02,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we just might have to leave those the way they are.

536
00:34:02,663 --> 00:34:04,530
Speaker 0: No, I'm gonna repost them in the new way.

537
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:07,563
Speaker 1: Then there's gonna be double episodes, that's fine.

538
00:34:07,603 --> 00:34:07,905
Speaker 0: I'm gonna.

539
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:08,929
Speaker 0: I'll note all the doubles.

540
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:11,304
Speaker 1: I think it's because it's it's it's not.

541
00:34:11,344 --> 00:34:11,847
Speaker 1: I'll show you.

542
00:34:12,431 --> 00:34:14,016
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's gonna work cuz we'll go.

543
00:34:14,257 --> 00:34:15,885
Speaker 0: it'll be worth it to have doubles.

544
00:34:15,905 --> 00:34:17,380
Speaker 0: if I'll have to change the names or something.

545
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:22,501
Speaker 0: It's worth it to have the audio there without the cruft audio.

546
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:23,626
Speaker 0: no one needs the news.

547
00:34:23,666 --> 00:34:24,790
Speaker 1: you just fast forward.

548
00:34:25,051 --> 00:34:25,632
Speaker 0: They don't.

549
00:34:25,994 --> 00:34:26,596
Speaker 0: you know people.

550
00:34:26,616 --> 00:34:27,579
Speaker 0: hey, whatever.

551
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:28,161
Speaker 1: They don't need it.

552
00:34:28,222 --> 00:34:30,690
Speaker 1: Oh, we've only actually done like a handful of book club episodes.

553
00:34:30,791 --> 00:34:31,376
Speaker 1: It won't be so bad.

554
00:34:31,396 --> 00:34:32,929
Speaker 1: Just leave the old ones the way they are.

555
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,389
Speaker 0: I want to put them in the feed at least even if I don't redo the audio.

556
00:34:36,592 --> 00:34:37,138
Speaker 1: It's not good.

557
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:37,867
Speaker 0: It's not.

558
00:34:41,052 --> 00:34:42,880
Speaker 1: Then you code the website to make it handle that.

559
00:34:43,001 --> 00:34:43,282
Speaker 0: I could.

560
00:34:43,322 --> 00:34:45,150
Speaker 0: I made a Django site before I quit my job.

561
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:46,373
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty.

562
00:34:46,735 --> 00:34:47,658
Speaker 0: It's pretty bare-bones.

563
00:34:47,998 --> 00:34:48,481
Speaker 1: Good luck.

564
00:34:48,561 --> 00:34:49,023
Speaker 0: You know what though?

565
00:34:49,043 --> 00:34:51,110
Speaker 0: It's got a great admin interface sure.

566
00:34:51,150 --> 00:34:52,333
Speaker 1: well Yeah, cuz it's automatic.

567
00:34:52,393 --> 00:35:03,970
Speaker 0: yeah, and you know the actually that admin really starts to fail whenever you start doing The unofficial book club book is not one book But it is many books basically all of the Prince of Nothing series by our Scott backer.

568
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:05,254
Speaker 0: Just read them all.

569
00:35:05,556 --> 00:35:10,935
Speaker 0: we're gonna be doing shows and shit on that stuff because it's having yet another Resurgence in the crew.

570
00:35:10,955 --> 00:35:14,189
Speaker 0: so we got to capitalize on that mm-hmm, and they're great books.

571
00:35:15,591 --> 00:35:18,701
Speaker 0: Otherwise New York comic-con anime festivals coming up doing stuff at that.

572
00:35:19,062 --> 00:35:21,270
Speaker 0: PAX East is coming up doing stuff at that.

573
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:27,179
Speaker 0: So we only got 30 seconds, so I have been a hero is a game Where you play an entire JRPG and I had 30 seconds.

574
00:35:27,761 --> 00:35:30,090
Speaker 1: awesome because that's my number one problem with JRPGs.

575
00:35:30,270 --> 00:35:31,594
Speaker 1: They take two goddamn.

576
00:35:31,674 --> 00:35:35,546
Speaker 0: I never thought I'd play a game where grinding was fun.

577
00:35:35,566 --> 00:35:36,007
Speaker 1: Well.

578
00:35:36,027 --> 00:35:37,755
Speaker 1: You're not actually Grinding.

579
00:35:37,796 --> 00:35:38,218
Speaker 1: that's sort of.

580
00:35:38,258 --> 00:35:39,909
Speaker 1: you are at a time under the world.

581
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:42,155
Speaker 0: It wasn't 30 seconds yet.

582
00:35:42,175 --> 00:35:44,122
Speaker 1: I'm just thinking guess, but when you are grinding.

583
00:35:44,282 --> 00:35:46,450
Speaker 0: It's kind of like it does all the work.

584
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:46,937
Speaker 0: It's like all right.

585
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,397
Speaker 0: I gotta level up now And takes like 10 seconds, maybe.

586
00:35:50,418 --> 00:35:53,650
Speaker 0: yeah, actually 10 seconds is a long time to spend grinding.

587
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:54,782
Speaker 1: This is the interesting thing right.

588
00:35:54,843 --> 00:35:55,086
Speaker 1: it's like.

589
00:35:56,012 --> 00:36:02,753
Speaker 1: You know you look at it and mechanically it is a JRPG, but because of the way It's done.

590
00:36:02,854 --> 00:36:04,301
Speaker 1: It's actually not.

591
00:36:04,361 --> 00:36:06,230
Speaker 1: it's more of a dexterity.

592
00:36:07,193 --> 00:36:08,890
Speaker 0: You know it's like a dexterity puzzle game.

593
00:36:08,991 --> 00:36:15,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you need the same skills as a platformer But you also need to figure out the order to do the things in and it's dry.

594
00:36:15,908 --> 00:36:17,475
Speaker 1: you know Grinding is.

595
00:36:17,595 --> 00:36:20,810
Speaker 1: maybe you'll have to do it, but it'll only take you like 30 seconds.

596
00:36:21,390 --> 00:36:23,579
Speaker 0: It's part of a path like do you want to grind?

597
00:36:23,699 --> 00:36:28,497
Speaker 0: or maybe you can find an item that'll beat the boss even if you're Not more powerful than sometimes the.

598
00:36:28,778 --> 00:36:30,986
Speaker 0: you know the grinding is gonna fill axe.

599
00:36:31,026 --> 00:36:32,170
Speaker 0: you get her with that bugs water.

600
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:34,159
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the grinding isn't just grinding.

601
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,390
Speaker 1: It's like actually you're racing against the clock.

602
00:36:36,531 --> 00:36:37,556
Speaker 1: I don't know how far you've gotten.

603
00:36:37,637 --> 00:36:39,889
Speaker 1: there's a level where you have to beat this hermit.

604
00:36:40,374 --> 00:36:42,616
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I got the hermit And it's like you have to beat.

605
00:36:42,938 --> 00:36:54,487
Speaker 1: you have to get enough levels to beat him otherwise You can just beat the level the other way, so it's like once you get to level 30 or 40 He'll challenge you, but in order to actually beat him you need to get to level 50 plus.

606
00:36:55,633 --> 00:36:58,747
Speaker 1: But you can only get levels by fighting him.

607
00:36:59,673 --> 00:37:14,180
Speaker 1: So you actually know what you need to do is need to get to level 439 and then fight him and get 11 levels in that one battle so that in the next battle when he challenges you You're over 50, and you need to time it just just right.

608
00:37:14,581 --> 00:37:23,590
Speaker 0: so I love how the game the first time you play like It says like all right you got 30 seconds the fucking world ends, and it doesn't tell you what to do or anything.

609
00:37:23,832 --> 00:37:25,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you like right like.

610
00:37:25,328 --> 00:37:28,361
Speaker 0: you're like Oh crap, and you run into town, and then the clock keeps going down.

611
00:37:28,502 --> 00:37:32,980
Speaker 0: like you go to the menu clock keeps going You're like what and then you die, and it's like all right.

612
00:37:33,502 --> 00:37:35,068
Speaker 0: We're gonna scale it back a little bit.

613
00:37:35,249 --> 00:37:37,709
Speaker 0: mmm I like that whole like shake it to me.

614
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,535
Speaker 1: So I just you know just some information right.

615
00:37:39,575 --> 00:37:47,830
Speaker 1: so this game was released in Japan known as Yusha 30 or Yusha Sanju Right hero 30 in Japan, and it was a real time.

616
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:52,128
Speaker 1: It was like it's a. Wikipedia describes it as a hybrid real-time strategy action RPG.

617
00:37:52,168 --> 00:37:56,399
Speaker 1: shoot him up Alright, it was released on the PSP in May 28.

618
00:37:56,399 --> 00:37:57,062
Speaker 1: Oh 9.

619
00:37:57,062 --> 00:38:00,916
Speaker 1: It was released on the North American PSP October Oh 9. it was Reese.

620
00:38:00,956 --> 00:38:12,549
Speaker 1: the reason we know about it is because on June 29th It was released on Xbox Live Arcade in the US under the title half-minute heroes super nega Neo climax and half-minute hero 2 has been announced.

621
00:38:14,192 --> 00:38:18,051
Speaker 1: So the first I think the only part of the game you've probably played is hero 30.

622
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:21,904
Speaker 1: I know there are other modes right so I've played some of evil Lord.

623
00:38:21,984 --> 00:38:26,198
Speaker 0: evil Lord 30 looks really fun Which is basically the same as hero 30.

624
00:38:26,198 --> 00:38:27,523
Speaker 1: only you're the your play.

625
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:29,710
Speaker 1: as do you remember the evil Lord who is hot and had?

626
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:30,880
Speaker 1: A bat for a girlfriend.

627
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:31,769
Speaker 1: Yeah, you play as him.

628
00:38:33,151 --> 00:38:54,250
Speaker 1: Then this princess 30 mode which is a shoot-em-up game this night 30 mode Which is an action game which I assume is more like Zelda This hero 300 mode except you have 300 seconds to beat a level, but the time goddess is not there and Certain areas of the map become inaccessible every 60 seconds of the game.

629
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:57,792
Speaker 1: I'm just reading this on Wikipedia because I haven't gotten past evil Lord 30.

630
00:38:57,792 --> 00:38:59,842
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've not played that much yet, but the game is.

631
00:38:59,942 --> 00:39:06,609
Speaker 1: and then this hero 3 mode Which is the same as hero 30, but you start with only 3 seconds, and there's only one mission.

632
00:39:09,682 --> 00:39:11,099
Speaker 0: That's Gotta be just a joke at the end.

633
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:12,489
Speaker 1: I think it's probably the end end.

634
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,439
Speaker 0: I don't there's a fun balance here of like.

635
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:18,649
Speaker 0: the game is funny and cute like the goddess is like.

636
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:22,243
Speaker 0: yeah I guess I could just roll back time, but I want money.

637
00:39:22,303 --> 00:39:24,030
Speaker 1: give me all the treasure and then I'll reset.

638
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:24,935
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you give me enough money.

639
00:39:24,955 --> 00:39:25,337
Speaker 1: I'll reset time.

640
00:39:25,618 --> 00:39:26,542
Speaker 0: It's like why do you need money?

641
00:39:26,563 --> 00:39:27,748
Speaker 0: Yeah, don't worry about that I?

642
00:39:29,630 --> 00:39:37,290
Speaker 0: Also, like how you can change the graphics between like normal modern graphic mode Which is like this cute kind of scribbly like drawn in MS.

643
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:42,507
Speaker 1: You know yeah, I like you know aesthetically be the Marty 16-bit.

644
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:44,730
Speaker 1: You know final I play in 16-bit mode.

645
00:39:45,013 --> 00:39:48,579
Speaker 1: I like that mode better aesthetically But actually it's harder to play in that mode.

646
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:50,530
Speaker 0: so I find it harder to play in the normal mode.

647
00:39:50,611 --> 00:39:52,322
Speaker 1: I play in the normal mode mostly even though.

648
00:39:52,342 --> 00:39:54,194
Speaker 1: I like the way the other mode looks But I think it's cuz.

649
00:39:54,214 --> 00:39:57,214
Speaker 0: I played the other mode first a whole bunch So maybe I'm used to.

650
00:39:57,254 --> 00:39:59,870
Speaker 1: it's really surprising cuz every single art asset in the game.

651
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:00,533
Speaker 1: They did twice.

652
00:40:00,995 --> 00:40:08,210
Speaker 1: you know it's like everything is 16-bit and also not and you know It's really the sometimes kind of cutscenes, but they'll do the full screen splash.

653
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:11,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was sort of a ninja guy dead in style ninja.

654
00:40:12,671 --> 00:40:16,323
Speaker 1: You're right ninja and in the 16-bit those look really great.

655
00:40:16,724 --> 00:40:19,870
Speaker 1: like you know the way they designed the characters It's gonna be really nostalgic.

656
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:21,014
Speaker 0: I think that was the intent.

657
00:40:21,034 --> 00:40:30,770
Speaker 1: you should if you should definitely play the very first level of hero 30 twice in both modes So that you can see how the splash screens have completely different art in both different graphics modes.

658
00:40:30,770 --> 00:40:34,088
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wish though you could just switch between the graphics modes instantly.

659
00:40:34,108 --> 00:40:39,290
Speaker 1: now You got to go to the menu and change it and it loads and it's kind of slow.

660
00:40:39,851 --> 00:40:40,274
Speaker 1: That's a little.

661
00:40:40,295 --> 00:40:44,419
Speaker 0: no if I could just hit like a trigger and just switch it I just feel like that would be awesome all the time.

662
00:40:44,881 --> 00:40:45,102
Speaker 1: Yep.

663
00:40:45,182 --> 00:40:45,624
Speaker 1: That'd be great.

664
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:47,030
Speaker 0: be cool if that an 8-bit mode.

665
00:40:47,616 --> 00:40:48,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's also cool.

666
00:40:48,810 --> 00:40:54,990
Speaker 1: You know it's got to say a lot of stuff that other RPGs have like when you change your equipment It changes how your guy looks yeah, and all that kind of stuff.

667
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:57,570
Speaker 0: There's a lot of characters, and they're all kind of fun.

668
00:40:57,650 --> 00:40:59,416
Speaker 0: It's one of those games like.

669
00:40:59,717 --> 00:41:02,084
Speaker 0: it's almost a big joke like the whole.

670
00:41:02,104 --> 00:41:08,430
Speaker 1: obviously half the game is a joke right It's like it's like they did a twist on the genre, but they actually made it better.

671
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:11,045
Speaker 1: But they also made it sort of a joke like lol.

672
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:15,966
Speaker 1: It's a JRPG Like oh you level up in like 10 seconds to level 50.

673
00:41:15,966 --> 00:41:18,295
Speaker 0: yep I think my favorite.

674
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:27,069
Speaker 0: like early on you run into this bard and you need him like well But it really helps to have him to get across this bridge where there's a big mushroom monster to be.

675
00:41:27,229 --> 00:41:28,133
Speaker 0: yeah Cuz this dog helps.

676
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:28,836
Speaker 0: he doesn't help.

677
00:41:28,876 --> 00:41:29,800
Speaker 0: he just stands there and sings.

678
00:41:29,820 --> 00:41:32,330
Speaker 0: the dog does all the work, but you're with him.

679
00:41:32,370 --> 00:41:35,673
Speaker 0: He's in your party for maybe Seven seconds.

680
00:41:35,954 --> 00:41:40,250
Speaker 0: yep as you run from one area to another area and halfway through he interrupts you.

681
00:41:40,250 --> 00:41:41,837
Speaker 0: He's like what a journey.

682
00:41:41,897 --> 00:41:43,343
Speaker 0: We are on and he says all this stuff.

683
00:41:43,363 --> 00:41:48,439
Speaker 0: You don't care about and then at the end He's like Our lives are changed for all the time.

684
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:49,864
Speaker 0: We spent together and the many memories.

685
00:41:49,884 --> 00:41:50,346
Speaker 0: We have.

686
00:41:50,426 --> 00:41:51,430
Speaker 1: did you see him a second time?

687
00:41:52,093 --> 00:41:52,535
Speaker 0: I did not.

688
00:41:52,575 --> 00:41:54,946
Speaker 1: you didn't get to the level where you collect all the people you've been with.

689
00:41:55,127 --> 00:41:55,710
Speaker 0: I did not do that.

690
00:41:55,931 --> 00:42:09,669
Speaker 1: There's certain boss levels and basically I think there are two of them Boss levels where all you do in the level is go around Collecting all the previous helpers from the previous levels and then bringing them all to the boss in a giant army and most of them Die and you do all the work.

691
00:42:09,991 --> 00:42:11,095
Speaker 1: But it's still pretty awesome.

692
00:42:11,115 --> 00:42:21,630
Speaker 0: the game does have a good mechanic of time trials to like if you've played a level before it shows A shadow of what you did last time And it doesn't also items from future levels on a past level.

693
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:24,983
Speaker 0: So if you know like oh, I level up and I go back and beat it faster.

694
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,710
Speaker 0: It's just can you beat it faster?

695
00:42:27,250 --> 00:42:35,286
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's also if you have friends in Xbox Live like for example I was playing and it was like I was sort of taking the slow way to beat a level completely.

696
00:42:35,306 --> 00:42:41,570
Speaker 1: get all the items level Up a whole bunch and it said on the screen like fast karate has you know is fighting the evil Lord?

697
00:42:41,690 --> 00:42:43,198
Speaker 1: And I'm like what it was mean.

698
00:42:43,239 --> 00:42:46,920
Speaker 1: Dave obviously beat the level a lot faster than I did I was obsessed with.

699
00:42:46,940 --> 00:42:48,530
Speaker 0: I think was like the second or third level.

700
00:42:48,913 --> 00:43:01,470
Speaker 0: I saw you had a score and It was like like way over 30 seconds because he did the goddess thing And I was so close to doing it without having to go to the goddess like I'm like a second away from it.

701
00:43:01,510 --> 00:43:02,580
Speaker 0: But I just can't do it.

702
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:03,770
Speaker 0: I wonder if it's even possible.

703
00:43:04,012 --> 00:43:06,090
Speaker 1: I've beaten levels with like a fraction of a second left.

704
00:43:06,171 --> 00:43:08,910
Speaker 1: I've gotten to the goddess of the fraction of a second left multiple times.

705
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think once I actually went to the goddess statue with literally 1/100 of a second on the clock.

706
00:43:12,745 --> 00:43:18,747
Speaker 0: I Like that mechanic, but it makes me obsessed with not having to go to the gods.

707
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:19,510
Speaker 0: if I can help you know.

708
00:43:19,650 --> 00:43:25,655
Speaker 1: That's another thing is you'll have five seconds left, and it's like well It'll take me two Seconds to fight a guy.

709
00:43:25,675 --> 00:43:28,526
Speaker 1: so you fight a guy and do this you get you get a little bit XP.

710
00:43:28,566 --> 00:43:28,948
Speaker 1: level up.

711
00:43:28,988 --> 00:43:30,174
Speaker 1: you got three Seconds left.

712
00:43:30,738 --> 00:43:32,589
Speaker 1: do you go out to fight another guy?

713
00:43:33,030 --> 00:43:38,810
Speaker 1: Do you risk it or do you just go and pull down because you want to get because you pay the goddess the same amount of Money no matter what foods cheap.

714
00:43:38,870 --> 00:43:42,044
Speaker 0: I'll usually go out and hold down B through the fight and hope I don't hands on the level.

715
00:43:42,084 --> 00:43:43,409
Speaker 1: some levels of expensive food.

716
00:43:43,469 --> 00:43:44,837
Speaker 1: some Levels have no food not true.

717
00:43:44,937 --> 00:43:47,350
Speaker 1: You know that's the thing is like you can't cover foods far away.

718
00:43:47,533 --> 00:43:47,878
Speaker 1: You can't.

719
00:43:47,939 --> 00:43:48,610
Speaker 1: early in the game.

720
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,944
Speaker 1: You can use the same formula for beating the levels But then very quickly every level has something different about it.

721
00:43:54,306 --> 00:43:59,198
Speaker 1: that makes it So you can't just follow the same formula You've been using which is level up.

722
00:43:59,238 --> 00:43:59,781
Speaker 1: go to the goddess.

723
00:43:59,821 --> 00:44:00,905
Speaker 1: level up go to the goddess level.

724
00:44:00,926 --> 00:44:01,930
Speaker 1: go to the goddess fight the boss.

725
00:44:02,252 --> 00:44:04,330
Speaker 1: Some levels there just won't be bad guys out there.

726
00:44:04,410 --> 00:44:06,829
Speaker 1: You'll have to find some other way to level up some levels.

727
00:44:06,869 --> 00:44:08,921
Speaker 1: there Just won't be any money from fighting bad guys.

728
00:44:09,162 --> 00:44:10,530
Speaker 1: you have to get your money somewhere else.

729
00:44:10,791 --> 00:44:13,481
Speaker 1: And it's like if you don't have money you can't pay the goddess.

730
00:44:13,903 --> 00:44:15,710
Speaker 1: so even you really leveled up a whole bunch.

731
00:44:15,911 --> 00:44:18,550
Speaker 1: You know you can't level up enough to go fight the evil lord.

732
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,440
Speaker 1: You need to pay the goddess at least once or twice.

733
00:44:20,742 --> 00:44:25,490
Speaker 0: you got to find the money somewhere Yep, and a lot of the levels have multiple ways to beat them.

734
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:30,708
Speaker 1: That's another thing is usually I'm super anti getting a hundred percent on the games because I don't have time for that shit.

735
00:44:30,949 --> 00:44:36,650
Speaker 1: right But in this game It's very clear about showing you Visually what you need to do to get a hundred percent.

736
00:44:36,731 --> 00:44:38,241
Speaker 1: And it's not too hard to figure it out either.

737
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:43,307
Speaker 1: like you'll go to a level and After you beat it the little dot on the map will still be gold which means you didn't get everything.

738
00:44:43,327 --> 00:44:49,313
Speaker 1: so you go over that And you put a and you see that there's a little symbol with a sword and shield and it's gray which means you think all The equipment.

739
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:58,510
Speaker 1: so you go back in the level and you just do it slow buying every equipment You can find and you're like oh I got it and that equipment is you need it because in the next level you're really gonna need that shit.

740
00:44:58,550 --> 00:45:00,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, then you'll go back and there'll be a level.

741
00:45:00,610 --> 00:45:01,795
Speaker 1: It's you didn't beat that one either.

742
00:45:01,835 --> 00:45:05,210
Speaker 1: so you go and you'll see like this you know why with two arrows coming at me.

743
00:45:05,250 --> 00:45:11,110
Speaker 1: It's like aha There's another path to beat this level and you really want to get those because that opens up other levels.

744
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:14,904
Speaker 1: I actually beat all of hero 30 in every single level.

745
00:45:14,925 --> 00:45:18,033
Speaker 1: in the only level I don't have a hundred percent Completion on.

746
00:45:18,073 --> 00:45:20,483
Speaker 1: it's a gold dot is the very last one and it's like.

747
00:45:20,523 --> 00:45:22,895
Speaker 1: it's weird because you know at the end of Megaman 2 There's two skulls.

748
00:45:22,976 --> 00:45:25,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a second skull on the map.

749
00:45:25,311 --> 00:45:30,629
Speaker 1: I can't figure out how the fuck to get to it But I've cleared out every other level in the entire game except the very last one.

750
00:45:32,190 --> 00:45:33,150
Speaker 1: But There it's cool.

751
00:45:33,251 --> 00:45:36,870
Speaker 1: You definitely want to get the other paths because the other paths have a lot of stuff in them.

752
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,449
Speaker 1: like my favorite path was the one where you make a deal with this evil devil.

753
00:45:40,469 --> 00:45:42,555
Speaker 1: and Basically, there's three or four levels.

754
00:45:42,596 --> 00:45:45,226
Speaker 1: you play and you have the power of like Satan and you're just.

755
00:45:45,467 --> 00:45:49,289
Speaker 1: you're like level of billion From the beginning of all these levels, but they're still hard.

756
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,230
Speaker 1: It's like they still have a challenge to them and then after the fourth level the final one.

757
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:56,004
Speaker 1: It's like the devil only gave you the power four times.

758
00:45:56,024 --> 00:45:57,009
Speaker 1: then he's gonna take your soul.

759
00:45:57,511 --> 00:46:02,387
Speaker 1: so if you don't beat that fourth level properly then the devil takes your soul and it's the end of the game.

760
00:46:02,889 --> 00:46:07,888
Speaker 1: and then you Have to like you have to beat the level a certain way in order for the time goddess to remove the.

761
00:46:08,089 --> 00:46:09,495
Speaker 1: you know The curse and protect your soul.

762
00:46:09,515 --> 00:46:10,820
Speaker 1: You got to give her all the treasure.

763
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,450
Speaker 1: Basically you have to get extra treasures to give her.

764
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:16,740
Speaker 0: That must be what Lena inverse turns into when she gets too much magic.

765
00:46:16,961 --> 00:46:18,847
Speaker 1: I definitely accept a different hair color.

766
00:46:18,987 --> 00:46:22,786
Speaker 0: Yeah That's what happens when you use high-powered magic a hair turns gray.

767
00:46:22,806 --> 00:46:32,877
Speaker 1: Yes So, I mean I bought a lot of games an Xbox Live arcade recently and you know the bastion one we talked about already and That's a demo.

768
00:46:32,897 --> 00:46:37,501
Speaker 1: yeah Galax, you know Galaga Legion's DX, which is all right.

769
00:46:37,581 --> 00:46:41,795
Speaker 0: It's not as good as pac-man, but it's way fun Yeah, but I think is it's not.

770
00:46:42,277 --> 00:46:44,545
Speaker 1: pac-man was a huge improvement over pac-man.

771
00:46:44,625 --> 00:46:46,431
Speaker 1: non DX Galaga Legion's.

772
00:46:46,472 --> 00:46:48,439
Speaker 1: DX is pretty equivalent to Galaga Legion's.

773
00:46:48,459 --> 00:46:50,667
Speaker 0: not but I had not played Galaga Legion.

774
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:51,450
Speaker 0: So I played DX.

775
00:46:51,611 --> 00:46:52,877
Speaker 0: It's just like everything's awesome.

776
00:46:53,098 --> 00:46:54,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, but half-minute hero.

777
00:46:54,827 --> 00:46:58,772
Speaker 1: of all those I've been playing this one the most obviously because I beat it all with you know And it does.

778
00:46:59,013 --> 00:47:03,597
Speaker 1: the thing that really helps me play it all and get completion on it without Worrying is because it's so quick.

779
00:47:03,919 --> 00:47:07,949
Speaker 0: I can like knock out a round and you know in a couple minutes I can beat like two levels if I'm good.

780
00:47:08,211 --> 00:47:08,753
Speaker 1: Yeah, you can.

781
00:47:08,773 --> 00:47:12,730
Speaker 1: you can beat a whole lot of it really quick at you know, fill it in while something's cooking.

782
00:47:13,211 --> 00:47:15,639
Speaker 0: It's got the right level of being funny and everything.

783
00:47:15,719 --> 00:47:17,666
Speaker 0: Also the music is fantastic.

784
00:47:17,746 --> 00:47:19,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's very strange.

785
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,661
Speaker 1: It's a little game would have this big awesome music in it, but it does.

786
00:47:22,022 --> 00:47:23,770
Speaker 0: well the thing is the neo-climax.

787
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,432
Speaker 0: It's got like.

788
00:47:24,653 --> 00:47:27,183
Speaker 0: the music is always like epic fantasy.

789
00:47:27,243 --> 00:47:27,625
Speaker 0: Let's go.

790
00:47:27,705 --> 00:47:29,492
Speaker 0: Holy shit JRPG Mm-hmm.

791
00:47:30,155 --> 00:47:33,150
Speaker 0: It almost makes me want to play like Final Fantasy 4 again.

792
00:47:33,310 --> 00:47:37,045
Speaker 1: It's except you realize that the fighting the guys is not instant and you could die.

793
00:47:37,065 --> 00:47:40,570
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, I don't know what else we can say.

794
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:41,753
Speaker 0: It's a tiny game.

795
00:47:41,854 --> 00:47:43,739
Speaker 0: at least the levels are tiny.

796
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:47,390
Speaker 0: the game feels tiny but it's actually pretty gigantic in terms of how much stuff?

797
00:47:47,410 --> 00:47:48,976
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you play.

798
00:47:48,996 --> 00:47:51,244
Speaker 0: it never gets old and every level is so different.

799
00:47:51,264 --> 00:47:55,384
Speaker 1: like Scott was pointing out it feels so quick But then you look back is like how many hours that I put into that?

800
00:47:55,465 --> 00:48:02,642
Speaker 1: Oh, fuck me It got me Pretty much with its instant gratification and quick battling.

801
00:48:02,722 --> 00:48:04,467
Speaker 0: There's no reason not to buy this game.

802
00:48:04,528 --> 00:48:05,771
Speaker 0: if you have an Xbox I think is.

803
00:48:05,812 --> 00:48:10,649
Speaker 1: I wish like you could get Final Fantasy 6 where the caught the random combat worked like this game genie.

804
00:48:11,875 --> 00:48:12,467
Speaker 1: Maybe I should.

805
00:48:13,630 --> 00:48:17,167
Speaker 0: Actually, yeah, I think that's the way to play old JRPG.

806
00:48:17,207 --> 00:48:20,710
Speaker 1: just, you know Get a game genie or emulator so that we love you billion.

807
00:48:20,952 --> 00:48:21,978
Speaker 0: I just go to the blue level.

808
00:48:22,018 --> 00:48:22,401
Speaker 1: a billion.

809
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:23,045
Speaker 1: you push a button.

810
00:48:23,065 --> 00:48:23,830
Speaker 1: you just win every fight.

811
00:48:24,911 --> 00:48:26,257
Speaker 1: Turn off all random encounters.

812
00:48:26,317 --> 00:48:27,964
Speaker 1: It's effort and your level of billions.

813
00:48:28,004 --> 00:48:31,754
Speaker 0: You win all boss fights like where's The bad guy Galvez?

814
00:48:31,794 --> 00:48:32,677
Speaker 0: punch him in the face the end.

815
00:48:32,697 --> 00:48:33,480
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

816
00:48:33,601 --> 00:48:34,785
Speaker 1: Yeah, if only it animated.

817
00:48:34,805 --> 00:48:35,648
Speaker 1: you punch him in the.

818
00:48:35,788 --> 00:48:38,113
Speaker 0: yes There's a mod.

819
00:48:38,153 --> 00:48:39,679
Speaker 0: take every JRPG and it's just you put.

820
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:42,170
Speaker 0: all you do is punch the big bad in the face and then the square.

821
00:48:42,230 --> 00:48:47,210
Speaker 1: Boss, you know, I don't think we actually did a description of what the this half-many hero is all about really.

822
00:48:47,270 --> 00:48:51,710
Speaker 1: So just to you know, cuz we completely missed the the this part the world's gonna end.

823
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:52,495
Speaker 1: All right, so the work.

824
00:48:52,516 --> 00:48:53,423
Speaker 1: there's an evil lord.

825
00:48:53,503 --> 00:48:54,290
Speaker 1: You don't know who he is.

826
00:48:54,330 --> 00:48:59,250
Speaker 1: He's the big bad evil of all big bad evils and he he knows a spell to end the world.

827
00:48:59,310 --> 00:49:04,410
Speaker 0: But apparently this spell is like a third level spell like it's way fast to cast easy to learn.

828
00:49:04,531 --> 00:49:06,150
Speaker 1: He doesn't want to cast it himself.

829
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:12,130
Speaker 1: So what he does is he goes around finding evil dudes who live in castles and he teaches them the evil spell.

830
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:17,290
Speaker 1: And much like rezo, they're not stupid and all these people want the world to end.

831
00:49:17,330 --> 00:49:23,333
Speaker 1: So as soon as the big bad guy teaches them the spell to end the world It's our cast and they start casting it Immediately.

832
00:49:23,393 --> 00:49:26,624
Speaker 1: and you know what it takes exactly 30 seconds for this spell to work.

833
00:49:26,664 --> 00:49:28,510
Speaker 1: and after 30 seconds the world ends.

834
00:49:28,751 --> 00:49:30,079
Speaker 0: I love there's the one king who did.

835
00:49:30,341 --> 00:49:31,850
Speaker 0: the evil lord didn't even try to teach him.

836
00:49:31,890 --> 00:49:35,019
Speaker 0: He just overheard the evil lord teaching someone else the spell.

837
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,704
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's how easy this shit is.

838
00:49:37,005 --> 00:49:40,257
Speaker 1: of that one bat cast it There's a bat trying to cast it.

839
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:41,563
Speaker 1: there's all sorts of crazy.

840
00:49:41,623 --> 00:49:43,230
Speaker 1: all the great evil lords are the greatest.

841
00:49:43,331 --> 00:49:50,477
Speaker 1: I wish there was like a Mode where like you played as all the evil lords from all because some of them are just so great Like there's a guy made of rocks.

842
00:49:50,798 --> 00:49:53,469
Speaker 1: There's the insect queen and a phillax.

843
00:49:54,170 --> 00:49:56,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's all and they all funny names.

844
00:49:56,550 --> 00:49:58,723
Speaker 1: They all look funny and they have funny things to say.

845
00:49:58,784 --> 00:50:02,094
Speaker 1: all the evil lords are great so every you.

846
00:50:02,114 --> 00:50:11,889
Speaker 1: basically you're a hero and you show up at some place with the castle on a little map and The evil lord as soon as you get there starts casting the spell and you got to level up enough to kill him.

847
00:50:12,592 --> 00:50:16,065
Speaker 1: You'll not only level up but get to him and kill him in 30 seconds.

848
00:50:16,266 --> 00:50:17,853
Speaker 0: now in the first few levels It's easy.

849
00:50:17,893 --> 00:50:23,338
Speaker 0: like as soon as you are a high enough level to where with full health You are stronger than the evil lord this thing

850
00:50:23,358 --> 00:50:31,570
Speaker 1: pops up and tells you you greater than evil, which is like aha I know now that I'm stronger than the evil lord, but I wish RPGs did that.

851
00:50:32,871 --> 00:50:41,036
Speaker 0: But at the same time that's not like that formula doesn't help you later because I've beaten many bosses where I was not greater than The evil lord, that's true.

852
00:50:41,196 --> 00:50:42,259
Speaker 1: Well, you don't have.

853
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:43,584
Speaker 1: you might have help or something.

854
00:50:43,885 --> 00:50:45,590
Speaker 1: You can beat the boss bucks water.

855
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,129
Speaker 1: Yes, you also.

856
00:50:47,971 --> 00:50:52,110
Speaker 1: There are some levels where even if you're greater than the evil lord, you can't get to the evil lord.

857
00:50:52,491 --> 00:50:59,426
Speaker 0: You see you didn't figure out how to work the map proper or you're greater than him But you have to fight so many of his goons to get to him that you're not really.

858
00:50:59,446 --> 00:51:00,390
Speaker 0: you're only greater than him.

859
00:51:00,612 --> 00:51:04,830
Speaker 1: You might be able to get to the castle But you might not be able to get to the castle with enough time left on the clock.

860
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:12,899
Speaker 1: So you have to figure out some way to get to like this hidden town near the castle so that you can reset the clock Close enough to the castle so you can get there with 30 seconds left.

861
00:51:13,321 --> 00:51:18,945
Speaker 1: and it's like a puzzle game even though it Visually and mathematically looks like grinding.

862
00:51:18,985 --> 00:51:22,078
Speaker 1: It's not grinding It's actually just part of the puzzle solving.

863
00:51:22,199 --> 00:51:24,406
Speaker 1: really how many guys do I need to kill before?

864
00:51:24,446 --> 00:51:25,470
Speaker 1: and then which town do I go?

865
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:27,319
Speaker 1: To in order to be able to get to the boss.

866
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:29,630
Speaker 0: There is no reason not to buy this game, right?

867
00:51:30,172 --> 00:51:33,304
Speaker 1: The rest of the plot is that there's this time princess.

868
00:51:33,364 --> 00:51:34,950
Speaker 1: What is she the god of time goddess?

869
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:38,770
Speaker 1: She's the goddess of time and she's good, but she's greedy.

870
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:47,950
Speaker 1: She wants treasure, right and there are statues of her all about the world and she basically comes to you and it's like hey Let's save the world, but I like money.

871
00:51:48,151 --> 00:51:49,034
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

872
00:51:49,535 --> 00:51:53,730
Speaker 1: if you want me to reset the clock, you know, basically send you 30 seconds back in time.

873
00:51:54,172 --> 00:51:54,473
Speaker 1: You got to.

874
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:58,070
Speaker 1: you know drop some money at a statue of me to fill up my coffers.

875
00:51:58,371 --> 00:52:01,625
Speaker 0: But she doubles the amount of money it costs every time she only adds 100.

876
00:52:01,625 --> 00:52:02,971
Speaker 1: I think only 100.

877
00:52:02,971 --> 00:52:04,119
Speaker 0: I've only ever done it once.

878
00:52:04,320 --> 00:52:05,710
Speaker 1: I don't really yeah.

879
00:52:05,912 --> 00:52:07,229
Speaker 1: Anyway, I've done a lot of times.

880
00:52:07,652 --> 00:52:19,786
Speaker 1: So you go to her statue and the first time in any given level the first time you go to the statue 100 then 200 that you keep giving her more and more money the more times you reset the clock per level So that when you go to the next level it'll start at 100 again.

881
00:52:20,932 --> 00:52:27,050
Speaker 1: So you think basically in those 30 seconds of playing you might just try to run around and do all the plot things.

882
00:52:27,391 --> 00:52:34,230
Speaker 1: But you have to do enough killing to get enough money to reset the clock in those 30 seconds No matter what else you do and get back to a statue.

883
00:52:34,331 --> 00:52:36,865
Speaker 1: Back to a statue also, right?

884
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:37,750
Speaker 1: So it's kind of tricky.

885
00:52:39,511 --> 00:52:42,079
Speaker 1: The other thing is I forget.

886
00:52:42,099 --> 00:52:44,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's not that much to this game.

887
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:45,389
Speaker 1: There's not that much.

888
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:47,652
Speaker 0: You should buy it.

889
00:52:47,672 --> 00:52:48,133
Speaker 0: it's great.

890
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:48,855
Speaker 0: It's awesome.
