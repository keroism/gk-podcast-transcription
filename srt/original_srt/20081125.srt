00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:00,896

00:03:35,921 --> 00:03:36,866
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to go to news?

59
00:03:36,907 --> 00:03:38,837
Speaker 0: I thought you had something to say about video games before news.

60
00:03:39,099 --> 00:03:40,885
Speaker 1: No I'm playing video games.

61
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:41,949
Speaker 0: Ah, me too.

62
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:43,434
Speaker 0: Mostly NS and left for dead.

63
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:43,876
Speaker 0: That's it.

64
00:03:44,337 --> 00:03:45,120
Speaker 0: and pie crust.

65
00:03:45,742 --> 00:03:49,676
Speaker 0: Hi cross fucking pie crust, you know, I still haven't even opened.

00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:50,700
Speaker 1: order ecclesia.

67
00:03:50,961 --> 00:03:52,588
Speaker 0: No, you know chrono trigger comes out.

68
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:53,271
Speaker 0: I think on.

69
00:03:53,412 --> 00:03:54,517
Speaker 1: I know I pre-ordered it.

70
00:03:54,537 --> 00:03:58,824
Speaker 0: Yeah All right I don't know.

71
00:03:58,844 --> 00:03:59,506
Speaker 0: you could have waited.

72
00:03:59,566 --> 00:04:00,871
Speaker 0: it would have been cheaper later.

73
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:03,700
Speaker 1: I've beaten that game like a hundred times.

74
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,214
Speaker 0: I've beaten it at least two times once on regular once on plus mode.

75
00:04:07,254 --> 00:04:08,580
Speaker 1: I've got it have memorized.

76
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,345
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a half memorized too.

77
00:04:10,365 --> 00:04:14,056
Speaker 0: Well, I start my memory only gets fuzzy once he gets like caveman land.

78
00:04:14,117 --> 00:04:18,906
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah So check this out Richard Bartle, do you know Richard Bartle is?

79
00:04:18,947 --> 00:04:19,529
Speaker 1: I've no idea.

80
00:04:19,548 --> 00:04:31,660
Speaker 0: He's the guy who made the mud the original mud right apparently Despite making and inventing the mud for all intents and purposes, you know Just as much as I guess Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone.

81
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:36,337
Speaker 0: He likes playing Wow and that that alone is shocking.

82
00:04:36,398 --> 00:04:47,459
Speaker 0: but He's talking about the wrath of the Lich King, right and he put this post up on I guess his blog and he's complaining about this quest early on in the game.

83
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:50,185
Speaker 0: and Basically, it's a quite want.

84
00:04:50,225 --> 00:04:52,132
Speaker 1: you kill six snow moose.

85
00:04:52,272 --> 00:04:53,456
Speaker 0: Yes kill six.

86
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:53,978
Speaker 0: No moose.

87
00:04:54,018 --> 00:04:58,151
Speaker 0: No This quest basically is a. it's a pretty simple quest.

88
00:04:58,191 --> 00:05:05,300
Speaker 0: You know, you take this needling rod of some sort and You go find this prisoner and you torture them for information.

89
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:10,300
Speaker 0: Basically, you needle them until they tell you what you need to know and then you complete the quest.

90
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:20,029
Speaker 1: Congratulations, but in Warcraft wouldn't this be basically you have the needler you find the guy you stand in front of him I'd like hold down whatever but that's that's pretty much all you have to do.

91
00:05:20,591 --> 00:05:23,680
Speaker 0: the what his problem Richard Bartle's problem?

92
00:05:23,881 --> 00:05:24,364
Speaker 1: they're gay.

93
00:05:24,947 --> 00:05:29,767
Speaker 1: one kids could guess that his problem is that you're Torturing someone in game.

94
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:31,535
Speaker 0: perhaps but that's not just.

95
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:34,608
Speaker 1: that's not his only problem You see see cuz the other way to go would be.

96
00:05:34,648 --> 00:05:37,400
Speaker 1: maybe his problem is that the torture is lame and not realistic.

97
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:41,768
Speaker 0: No, no He's the crux of his problem.

98
00:05:41,809 --> 00:05:49,300
Speaker 0: Is that you can't decide not to You can't say you can't you know, the guy comes up to you and says hey torture this prisoner.

99
00:05:50,063 --> 00:05:54,860
Speaker 0: You can't say no, it's it's you either do it or you're stuck and you can't continue.

100
00:05:55,302 --> 00:05:59,839
Speaker 1: That's pretty much the way all quests and all MMOs have always been.

101
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:03,150
Speaker 0: You know, that's true to some extent.

102
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,920
Speaker 0: but the thing is I think about the old muds.

103
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,944
Speaker 0: Right the old muds.

104
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:15,565
Speaker 0: and even though the old muds, you know, they were no, you know burning wheel They they were you know They they didn't have.

105
00:06:15,866 --> 00:06:16,890
Speaker 1: usually the choices.

106
00:06:17,191 --> 00:06:22,231
Speaker 1: if you were on a quest in the old muds was The king is giving you a quest do you accept?

107
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:23,898
Speaker 1: and if you say no he kills you.

108
00:06:23,918 --> 00:06:25,664
Speaker 0: well Yeah, that was quite often.

109
00:06:25,704 --> 00:06:29,999
Speaker 0: but there were you know attempts to give because those things were based on D&D.

110
00:06:30,481 --> 00:06:35,936
Speaker 0: There were some attempts to give you choices and things and you know make things matter.

111
00:06:35,976 --> 00:06:40,538
Speaker 0: and you had like You're all you had actually had an alignment that would you know change from you know?

112
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:45,700
Speaker 0: Lawful to neutral and good depending on what you did, you know, even the realm had that.

113
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:49,160
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember you you started out good neutral evil, whatever.

114
00:06:49,522 --> 00:06:53,640
Speaker 0: I pick neutral because if you start, you know, if you go to the one place and kill angels you become evil.

115
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:56,897
Speaker 0: But if you go to the other place and kill the devil's you become good.

116
00:06:56,917 --> 00:06:59,279
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, you steal from people you become evil.

117
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:07,639
Speaker 1: And I remember I became evil in order to get the multi blade aka the multi pass Which was not nearly as powerful or cool as I thought it would be once I got it.

118
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,543
Speaker 0: But it does make me realize something in that That even that simple Effectively useless.

119
00:07:14,764 --> 00:07:27,212
Speaker 0: right, you know alignment decision mechanism that was in the older muds is apparently completely non-existent in Wow and even that all you know tiny bit of nothing is better than nothing.

120
00:07:28,255 --> 00:07:29,739
Speaker 0: and it is kind of sad.

121
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:43,500
Speaker 0: and Not only that but he says You know, what is this gonna mean for you know on a regular server people just questing to you know advance No, a lot of people won't even notice or anything, you know, but he's like on the roleplay servers.

122
00:07:43,863 --> 00:07:45,152
Speaker 0: What are they supposed to make of this?

123
00:07:45,233 --> 00:07:46,200
Speaker 0: Everyone is a torturer?

124
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:49,775
Speaker 1: Well from what I've gathered most of the people are role-playing.

125
00:07:49,795 --> 00:07:53,087
Speaker 1: games like Wow Will basically roleplay.

126
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:57,600
Speaker 1: we're among themselves with their own stories just happening to use the kind of world around them.

127
00:07:57,640 --> 00:08:01,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, they'll ignore the quest and stuff because it doesn't make sense.

128
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,744
Speaker 1: Everyone did the quest.

129
00:08:02,885 --> 00:08:03,787
Speaker 1: everyone's the hero.

130
00:08:03,927 --> 00:08:07,277
Speaker 0: So yeah, the other thing is that he says.

131
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:11,953
Speaker 0: the other thing He that bothers him is that this torture was not.

132
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,860
Speaker 0: it's not that there's a quest with torture, right?

133
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,233
Speaker 0: You can make a quest with torture.

134
00:08:15,274 --> 00:08:15,900
Speaker 0: That would be good.

135
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:21,982
Speaker 0: You know what if you had a decision or if you portrayed it in such a way as to make people realize Something?

136
00:08:22,103 --> 00:08:29,245
Speaker 0: or maybe if you tortured and then you know, someone came and it was like what the hell bucks wrong with you Why couldn't it just be?

137
00:08:29,265 --> 00:08:33,240
Speaker 1: the moral of the game is that torture is awesome and always gets you what you want.

138
00:08:33,442 --> 00:08:36,287
Speaker 0: I mean, okay But he says the thing that bothers him.

139
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:45,500
Speaker 0: the most is that this torture was sort of placed in the game Casually as a run-of-the-mill quest with no regard for the fact that that was something that was sort of weird.

140
00:08:45,562 --> 00:09:00,896
Speaker 1: You know Something that wait, but I point out bionic commando back in the day one point you find this Enemy's this Nazi soldier and he basically says I ain't talking to you And if you rough him up a bit, then he talks to you.

141
00:09:01,057 --> 00:09:10,119
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, and they added that I mean They're Atari the fact that they took that and made sure that it was still in the new bionic commando.

142
00:09:10,723 --> 00:09:12,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're like, hey torture that guy.

143
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:16,820
Speaker 1: So you walk in and you just kind of poke him a bit then he goes out he talks and then you kill him.

144
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,306
Speaker 0: but I just think it's you know, It's sort of interesting.

145
00:09:21,607 --> 00:09:22,491
Speaker 1: There's two ways to go.

146
00:09:22,531 --> 00:09:31,860
Speaker 1: I mean, of course my ideal MMO, you know massively multiplayer online role-playing game, which is not what mmorpgs are anymore.

147
00:09:32,584 --> 00:09:33,830
Speaker 1: well, if they ever were that.

148
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:42,500
Speaker 1: but imagine a world where You have junctures like that all the time and you always have all these choices and not everyone follows the same path.

149
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,559
Speaker 1: You could take the the oblivion or the fallout idea of there's a million different things out there.

150
00:09:48,142 --> 00:10:00,655
Speaker 1: But and everyone can take different paths, you know kind of like a multiplayer fallout but with a lot more stuff and they're not all just fetch quests and Make it so that every decision you make affects your character permanently in some way.

151
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:02,220
Speaker 1: that's rolled into your narrative.

152
00:10:03,146 --> 00:10:04,000
Speaker 1: That's one way to do it.

153
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,627
Speaker 1: The other way is to have it where you go one step further.

154
00:10:07,049 --> 00:10:13,480
Speaker 1: every single quest every single thing is unique and isn't just Creating the character the narrative for your character.

155
00:10:13,861 --> 00:10:15,506
Speaker 1: You're creating the world's narrative.

156
00:10:15,847 --> 00:10:17,011
Speaker 1: you went and did this thing.

157
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:20,782
Speaker 1: now the flavor text there or the characters there reflect that.

158
00:10:20,863 --> 00:10:28,286
Speaker 1: the problem is the former is too difficult for a lot of players and it also and but yet it's not far enough for The people are really into role-playing.

159
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:31,160
Speaker 1: The latter is in no way economically viable.

160
00:10:31,722 --> 00:10:35,233
Speaker 0: See, I think really what the thing what could happen here right is.

161
00:10:35,293 --> 00:10:38,383
Speaker 0: I was thinking about NS which is a game We're playing a lot lately.

162
00:10:38,464 --> 00:10:55,500
Speaker 0: and the thing about NS that's different from every other game that I've ever that I can think of right is That the quests or objectives and NS if they're not like a built into the game kind of thing It's not like, you know, you play some games and it's like go here and pull this lever like look at left for dead.

163
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:58,171
Speaker 0: It's like everyone get in the crane and push the button.

164
00:10:58,191 --> 00:10:58,954
Speaker 0: That's the quest.

165
00:10:59,256 --> 00:11:00,280
Speaker 0: It's built into the game.

166
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,555
Speaker 0: It's a set thing and NS as a team or as an individual.

167
00:11:04,917 --> 00:11:09,840
Speaker 0: you are constantly Making quests making up objectives, but they make sense.

168
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,457
Speaker 0: You know, it's your create your sculpting the game on your own as a player.

169
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:20,967
Speaker 1: So what if you had a game like if Wow had a thing where you know the Horde and ever they're fighting and you Like when you can play?

170
00:11:21,008 --> 00:11:22,680
Speaker 1: every time you complete these unique quests?

171
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:27,940
Speaker 1: They change things in the world on the other side and accomplish but not even not in the court?

172
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,931
Speaker 0: There wouldn't be quests programmed into the game at all.

173
00:11:30,971 --> 00:11:32,196
Speaker 0: You would come up with the quest.

174
00:11:32,236 --> 00:11:35,045
Speaker 0: you would just do things You came up with.

175
00:11:35,106 --> 00:11:40,904
Speaker 0: yeah, I did that other players decided, you know, what game did that planet side Did area?

176
00:11:41,325 --> 00:11:44,235
Speaker 1: planet side was basically a giant NS in that regard.

177
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:45,680
Speaker 1: It was you know, I'm on this team.

178
00:11:46,204 --> 00:11:47,999
Speaker 1: Hey, let's all attack such-and-such.

179
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:50,248
Speaker 1: Just go there and attack it and take it.

180
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:52,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, of course, I'm at other problems.

181
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:53,710
Speaker 1: Well, I wasn't.

182
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:54,780
Speaker 1: I'm talking about the concept.

183
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:55,667
Speaker 1: I mean if you wanted to.

184
00:11:56,251 --> 00:12:01,376
Speaker 1: if I bring up any game We could of course talk about what's wrong with it because as everyone knows we hate all games.

185
00:12:01,697 --> 00:12:09,177
Speaker 0: all games suck Except for an asset for Tigris in your phrase except for TD NS tribes - that's it.

186
00:12:09,397 --> 00:12:10,380
Speaker 0: Every other game sucks.

187
00:12:12,146 --> 00:12:14,483
Speaker 1: Zelda one Zelda 2 was better.

188
00:12:14,623 --> 00:12:15,886
Speaker 0: No, you what do you know?

189
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,372
Speaker 1: I know Zelda 2 was better.

190
00:12:18,432 --> 00:12:25,090
Speaker 0: So you just said the translation, you know, nothing Anyway, but actually this it's still.

191
00:12:25,131 --> 00:12:27,380
Speaker 1: this really plays into what I've always my whole life.

192
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:40,472
Speaker 1: what I've wanted is even a single-player game where Decisions matter and you're allowed to lose and the game continues, you know a branching story where our fortress But that's not really.

193
00:12:40,492 --> 00:12:41,760
Speaker 1: it's not the same kind of game.

194
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:48,380
Speaker 0: Well to our fortress is similar and that you have a narrative emerging from your own decision-making.

195
00:12:48,843 --> 00:12:51,620
Speaker 1: I'm talking about something as simple as all right.

196
00:12:51,801 --> 00:12:53,005
Speaker 1: It's a Final Fantasy ish game.

197
00:12:53,046 --> 00:12:54,110
Speaker 1: go and save the princess.

198
00:12:54,632 --> 00:12:56,319
Speaker 1: if you make it you save the princess.

199
00:12:56,419 --> 00:12:57,844
Speaker 1: great You know the plot continues.

200
00:12:58,346 --> 00:13:00,574
Speaker 1: if you fail princess dies.

201
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,159
Speaker 1: game continues to the end.

202
00:13:03,381 --> 00:13:05,227
Speaker 0: Well, our game continues in some way.

203
00:13:05,247 --> 00:13:06,592
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it ends.

204
00:13:06,813 --> 00:13:07,636
Speaker 1: all games end.

205
00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:08,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, except Wow.

206
00:13:10,163 --> 00:13:11,841
Speaker 1: But well, I guess you've hit level 80.

207
00:13:11,841 --> 00:13:17,712
Speaker 0: Yeah There's only so many times you can kill the exact same monster over and over again and everyone else also kills them over and over again.

208
00:13:18,684 --> 00:13:20,843
Speaker 1: But just the idea that Losing.

209
00:13:21,044 --> 00:13:25,440
Speaker 0: and think about how many times this prisoner has been tortured, but how many games could just do this?

210
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,184
Speaker 1: I mean burning wheel.

211
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:30,664
Speaker 1: remember we talked in beyond Dungeons & Dragons about how in D&D what?

212
00:13:30,745 --> 00:13:34,418
Speaker 1: generally when you play Dungeons & Dragons it is make a test.

213
00:13:34,659 --> 00:13:35,444
Speaker 1: try You know fighting.

214
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:35,947
Speaker 1: do a fight.

215
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:39,224
Speaker 1: if you make the test or win the fight the plot continues.

216
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:45,673
Speaker 1: if you fail at the test or lose the fight the plot basically stops until you Make the test or win the fight.

217
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:51,316
Speaker 1: in Burning wheel the idea is that no if you make the test you continue to the next test.

218
00:13:51,657 --> 00:13:56,596
Speaker 1: if you fail Instead of stopping you go in a different direction with a complication being added.

219
00:13:56,616 --> 00:14:02,114
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm yeah, everything you're everything you do in a game just takes the game in a different direction.

220
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:05,477
Speaker 0: as opposed to they're being a line and You try to get to the end of it.

221
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:20,413
Speaker 0: It is you take a step and then every time you take a step you either go straight left or right and you know If you fail, you're gonna say basically take all left turns until there's no until you die or there's nowhere else to go You know, but if you succeed you're gonna go straight ahead.

222
00:14:20,534 --> 00:14:21,780
Speaker 0: if you succeed every time, you know.

223
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:27,793
Speaker 0: But if you succeed and fail in different ways You go straight left right straight and end up at different places every time you play.

224
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:31,378
Speaker 0: and I think if you had a game Like fallout, right?

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:44,299
Speaker 0: But if you took out the sort of you know, do this quest here and the game ends kind of stuff, you know It was just here's the world go instead of you know, go get me that water controller chip at the below.

226
00:14:44,439 --> 00:14:45,904
Speaker 1: it is Here's the world go.

227
00:14:45,965 --> 00:14:47,932
Speaker 1: but there's also a way to end the game.

228
00:14:48,193 --> 00:14:49,238
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine.

229
00:14:49,478 --> 00:14:49,780
Speaker 0: It's okay.

230
00:14:50,121 --> 00:14:54,057
Speaker 1: I mean the real problem with those games is that but it's better than torture this prisoner.

231
00:14:54,077 --> 00:14:54,740
Speaker 0: You have no choice.

232
00:14:54,928 --> 00:14:59,335
Speaker 1: Well, no The only problem with those games really is I've found is that there just isn't enough to do.

233
00:14:59,375 --> 00:15:01,844
Speaker 1: that's novel and most quests are Effectively the same thing.

234
00:15:01,864 --> 00:15:02,847
Speaker 1: I mean oblivion.

235
00:15:03,369 --> 00:15:04,955
Speaker 1: go get this book from this cave.

236
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:05,578
Speaker 1: Thank you.

237
00:15:05,618 --> 00:15:06,180
Speaker 1: Here's some money.

238
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:08,447
Speaker 1: I heard there's another book in another cave.

239
00:15:08,808 --> 00:15:10,493
Speaker 1: I could give you money in exchange for getting it.

240
00:15:11,175 --> 00:15:11,516
Speaker 0: great.

241
00:15:11,797 --> 00:15:13,261

Speaker 0: I like books.

243
00:15:14,686 --> 00:15:15,850
Speaker 1: Oh, well, this is all all these.

244
00:15:16,071 --> 00:15:24,297
Speaker 1: all this is bit by bit getting rolled into what is eventually going to Be the panel we hope to present at the next packs, which we're still tentatively calling losing should be fun.

245
00:15:24,458 --> 00:15:24,779
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

246
00:15:25,944 --> 00:15:28,080
Speaker 1: But anyway, there's this article on slashdot.

247
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:32,052
Speaker 1: I kind of want to talk about it because these sorts of articles come up a lot now.

248
00:15:32,152 --> 00:15:44,873
Speaker 1: it was how politics interact with games and Constantly in every gaming plan s people go blah blah blah Ron Paul Ron Paul Obama Obama Obama, but that that's not games.

249
00:15:44,913 --> 00:15:45,656
Speaker 1: That's the internet.

00:15:45,676 --> 00:15:46,339
Speaker 1: you go anywhere.

251
00:15:48,602 --> 00:16:01,214
Speaker 0: You realize Ron Paul supporters are like random encounters on the internet except You know how many times I've gone to the ready room in an NS game and there's someone yelling like spouting conspiracy nonsense Like oh, man's your evil politicians.

252
00:16:01,274 --> 00:16:04,405
Speaker 0: They ruined your economies All your money.

253

Speaker 1: I think it's that I mean it's right out there with me.

267
00:16:48,715 --> 00:16:49,216

270
00:17:02,256 --> 00:17:03,180
Speaker 1: I'm proud of all of you.

271
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:09,020
Speaker 1: Geek nice listeners seem to account for about 80% of the NS noobs right now.

272
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:10,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, all back is.

273
00:17:10,824 --> 00:17:12,208
Speaker 1: I love you guys.

274
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,959
Speaker 1: you guys for like a week almost ruined NS for me.

275
00:17:16,542 --> 00:17:21,002
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't know how to play NS Don't play.

276
00:17:21,103 --> 00:17:26,560
Speaker 0: well do play but don't play with people who know how to play because you'll ruin the game.

277
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:29,372
Speaker 0: I mean think about a game you're really good at right a minute.

278
00:17:29,412 --> 00:17:31,260
Speaker 1: What but how hypocritical is this?

279
00:17:31,802 --> 00:17:34,960
Speaker 1: We like this really obscure game that no one else likes and we're really good at it.

280
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,329
Speaker 1: So we tell people how great it is.

281
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:37,839
Speaker 1: Yep, and we tell them to play it.

282
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,859
Speaker 1: Yep, they come and play it and pee in the pool as a result.

283
00:17:41,081 --> 00:17:42,617
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now we tell them to get out of the pool.

284
00:17:43,344 --> 00:17:49,180
Speaker 0: We don't get a pee in the kiddie pool first And then you can come in the big kids pool and then you can come on the high dive.

285
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,636
Speaker 0: Kitties who pee can't go on the high dive.

286
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:54,410
Speaker 1: All right The problem is the kiddie pool and NS.

287
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,580
Speaker 1: is that one like marine training bot server?

288
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:58,327
Speaker 0: Well, you guys got it.

289
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:02,790
Speaker 0: You know, there's people are and if you go to the forum You know, we're trying to set up a server.

290
00:18:02,851 --> 00:18:04,620
Speaker 0: I think G David set up a server.

291
00:18:04,761 --> 00:18:06,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, they are working on some tutorials.

292
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:11,880
Speaker 0: But yeah, well all you kiddies can go try to like play with each other on some empty servers or something.

293
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,250
Speaker 0: Don't come to our servers.

294
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,292
Speaker 0: Don't join our games Unless you're good until you figured it out.

295
00:18:18,613 --> 00:18:20,522
Speaker 0: not because I don't want to play with you I do.

296
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:26,860
Speaker 0: and if you actually if you guys you know do find a kiddie pool to play and maybe I'll come in the kiddie Pool and you know show you how things are done.

297
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:31,640
Speaker 1: But I believe you mean come in the kiddie pool and shove everyone down laughing hysterically the whole time.

298
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:34,693
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, that's probably what'll happen because that's how the game works.

299
00:18:34,753 --> 00:18:41,956
Speaker 1: But you know, it's Imagining jump into the calm drop one shotgun and then like man rush the hive.

300
00:18:42,116 --> 00:18:42,457
Speaker 0: think of it.

301
00:18:42,538 --> 00:18:43,502
Speaker 0: think of it this way right?

302
00:18:43,542 --> 00:18:45,898
Speaker 0: pretend you're really good at.

303
00:18:45,918 --> 00:18:48,105
Speaker 0: oh You know monopoly right.

304
00:18:48,145 --> 00:18:52,480
Speaker 0: monopoly is a game that even if people don't like it because we don't people understand it, right?

305
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,820
Speaker 0: Let's say you're playing monopoly and you know how to play you're really good and everyone else sucks.

306
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,007
Speaker 0: That's kind of fun for a little while.

307
00:18:59,087 --> 00:19:03,425
Speaker 0: cuz it's like I got boardwalk and the other guys like Oh, New York I don't need to buy that.

308
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:04,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll just pass on that one.

309
00:19:04,730 --> 00:19:06,217
Speaker 0: Who cares, you know, oh shit.

310
00:19:06,257 --> 00:19:06,940
Speaker 0: I'm in jail.

311
00:19:07,302 --> 00:19:07,604
Speaker 0: What's this?

312
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:08,851
Speaker 0: get out of jail free card, dude?

313
00:19:08,872 --> 00:19:09,515
Speaker 0: Should I use that?

314
00:19:09,576 --> 00:19:15,037
Speaker 0: No, okay I won't you know, but imagine if someone who doesn't know how to play is on your team.

315
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:17,144
Speaker 0: It's like yeah I don't want to buy that boardwalk.

316
00:19:17,245 --> 00:19:17,867
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

317
00:19:17,927 --> 00:19:19,593
Speaker 0: Oh my god by the stupid boardwalk.

318
00:19:19,653 --> 00:19:20,557
Speaker 0: No, I don't want to.

319
00:19:20,577 --> 00:19:23,710
Speaker 0: ah You know, you're gonna be mad frustrated.

320
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:27,003
Speaker 0: So when you join an NS game It's a team game.

321
00:19:27,404 --> 00:19:32,900
Speaker 0: So if you're not good, you can especially if you're an alien Scott Scott, you can ruin your team.

322
00:19:33,301 --> 00:19:35,005
Speaker 1: I'm gonna translate what you just said.

323
00:19:35,547 --> 00:19:37,071
Speaker 1: get the hell off my lawn.

324
00:19:37,171 --> 00:19:37,973
Speaker 1: God damn it.

325
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:40,499
Speaker 0: Join the other team at least not my team.

326
00:19:42,226 --> 00:19:45,548
Speaker 0: mean if you're At least if you're a marine you can build.

327
00:19:45,688 --> 00:19:53,075
Speaker 0: most damage you can do as a marine is just keep getting killed Constantly and all that will do is give the other team some RFK.

328
00:19:53,577 --> 00:19:56,367
Speaker 0: if you're an alien You're getting these resource points.

329
00:19:56,407 --> 00:20:02,627
Speaker 0: if you don't know how to spend them or if you like turn into an onos and die You just cost your team like 75 res.

330
00:20:02,727 --> 00:20:07,300
Speaker 0: Oh my god, you just hey for everybody compared to Scott Johnson and left for dead.

331
00:20:07,683 --> 00:20:08,451
Speaker 0: Well, we'll get to that.

332
00:20:08,531 --> 00:20:16,844
Speaker 0: We'll get to that Anyway, but the regardless of all that did the same thing in NS - he joined a game of NS and he was sitting there Not spending his res.

333
00:20:16,864 --> 00:20:21,497
Speaker 0: and then he sort of he turned into a gorge built some things and then left when he realized he forgot how to play.

334
00:20:22,641 --> 00:20:26,520
Speaker 1: I've whenever I'm gonna leave a game and I ever as I always turn into a gorge build a bunch of stuff and then leave.

335
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,940
Speaker 1: I figure leave a nice parting shot for my friends.

336
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:30,688
Speaker 0: Yeah, you got to do something like that.

337
00:20:31,110 --> 00:20:37,998
Speaker 1: or just onos rush and die and then leave At least be a lurk and spray a bunch, but no, that's a long-term strategy.

338
00:20:38,038 --> 00:20:38,620
Speaker 1: Not a short-term.

339
00:20:39,501 --> 00:20:57,628
Speaker 1: Anyway, no this article reeks of trying to tie Barack Obama's name into a video game article for a good press and linkage, but Basically the gist of this article is that yes with Barack Obama in power Maybe we can save the video game industry and

340
00:20:58,190 --> 00:20:59,092
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

341
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,456
Speaker 1: No, here are two of the points.

342
00:21:00,496 --> 00:21:01,960
Speaker 1: This guy makes one.

343
00:21:02,805 --> 00:21:16,936
Speaker 1: We have to save the middleware developers Okay from being bought out by the game developers the middleware developers of the unsung heroes But no one knows who they are and they should get tax cuts in order to remain independent.

344
00:21:17,197 --> 00:21:19,471
Speaker 1: What and This one?

345
00:21:19,713 --> 00:21:20,599
Speaker 1: this should have not?

346
00:21:22,802 --> 00:21:24,754
Speaker 0: Barack Obama doesn't give a shit about this.

347
00:21:24,774 --> 00:21:34,685
Speaker 1: No, they're saying that the Politicians and the government should intercede in the video game industry to foster a better environment for it And maybe it'll be.

348
00:21:34,725 --> 00:21:36,672
Speaker 0: maybe in no France or Canada.

349
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:40,386
Speaker 1: the weak sauce tie to Barack Obama Is that he's a new president?

350
00:21:40,687 --> 00:21:50,259
Speaker 1: Maybe he'll do this stuff, but the one that bothers me Giving recognition the shitty article we now have to link to because I want to talk about an issue that they bring up.

351
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:57,920
Speaker 1: This has come up a lot and I talked about it I think last time but he basically says we need to crack down on the secondary market.

352
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:18,699
Speaker 1: people who make games should get mandatory legal compensation Every time the game changes hands in the secondary market fail And the government should regulate this with the equivalent of a blue book and at the same time price controls To make sure that the secondary market that is regulated doesn't gouge anyone

353
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,543
Speaker 0: Fail.

354
00:22:20,844 --> 00:22:31,560
Speaker 1: well, I mean aside from the obvious argument of anytime someone creates IP I mean, I think everyone agrees that if you create intellectual property, you need to be compensated in a reasonable way.

355
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:41,171
Speaker 1: Otherwise the incentive to create intellectual property or the ability to raise money to create high-budget intellectual property Basically goes down the toilet and nothing else gets made.

356
00:22:41,412 --> 00:22:46,500
Speaker 0: Well, unless we go back to the old-school Patron system which you know has infinity problems.

357
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:53,523
Speaker 0: Well, yes Because then probably the real thing is we have two systems the patron system and the copyright system and both of them have infinity Problems each.

358
00:22:53,804 --> 00:22:54,407
Speaker 0: So what do you do?

359
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:55,873
Speaker 1: But the thing is the.

360
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:59,840
Speaker 1: I think the free market Compensation system works a lot better.

361
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:06,305
Speaker 1: The only problem with IP is that the compensation system is set to where you can make one thing and expect a profit off of It for 90 years.

362
00:23:07,925 --> 00:23:15,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway Why do people treat the video game secondary market so differently from everything else?

363
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:19,920
Speaker 0: They're used bookstores are off, you know authors are still not complaining about it.

364
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:22,489
Speaker 1: Yeah used CD stores have always been a big hit.

365
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:22,971
Speaker 1: There's.

366
00:23:23,713 --> 00:23:25,339
Speaker 1: I can buy a used car.

367
00:23:27,861 --> 00:23:28,844
Speaker 1: There's no regulation.

368
00:23:28,884 --> 00:23:33,300
Speaker 0: are used used cars are the reason that you know, they should just ban the sale of used cars.

369
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:34,623
Speaker 0: Then Detroit will be saved.

370
00:23:35,085 --> 00:23:37,551
Speaker 1: I saw someone argue that not ironic.

371
00:23:37,571 --> 00:23:40,098
Speaker 0: What the fuck what the fuck?

372
00:23:40,178 --> 00:23:46,688
Speaker 1: Yes But that seems like the video game industry.

373
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:59,839
Speaker 1: it has this weird relationship with politics in that politicians especially in America and Australia and Britain Seem to really really really like metal in the video game industry a lot.

374
00:24:00,099 --> 00:24:04,000
Speaker 1: yet They don't metal it nearly the same level in all the other kinds of IP.

375
00:24:04,562 --> 00:24:08,140
Speaker 1: They don't come down on violent movies nearly as hard as they do in violent video games.

376
00:24:08,421 --> 00:24:09,265
Speaker 1: They don't come down on.

377
00:24:09,728 --> 00:24:11,134
Speaker 1: I mean a boob in a movie.

378
00:24:11,275 --> 00:24:14,052
Speaker 1: All right, that's okay nowadays You know it.

379
00:24:14,092 --> 00:24:19,580
Speaker 0: back in the day They came down hard and the rock music and then now the people in charge are the rock music.

380
00:24:19,681 --> 00:24:23,000
Speaker 0: So as soon as the people in charge are the video games, they won't come down on anymore.

381
00:24:23,262 --> 00:24:24,250
Speaker 0: It's the history of the world.

382
00:24:24,552 --> 00:24:25,460
Speaker 0: It can't be changed.

383
00:24:25,721 --> 00:24:26,524
Speaker 0: I know things are.

384
00:24:26,605 --> 00:24:38,228
Speaker 1: the problem here is that technology is moving a lot faster than it used to and Video games have gone from nothing to niche to mature wide market audience Long long before that change.

385
00:24:38,288 --> 00:24:42,060
Speaker 1: I mean the rock and roll revolution and the movie industry revolution.

386
00:24:42,563 --> 00:24:45,660
Speaker 1: The technology and the advancement of movies just went more slowly.

387
00:24:46,183 --> 00:24:52,693
Speaker 1: Look how far video games have come in the last I don't know ten years And yet the politics have gotten more restrictive and even worse.

388
00:24:53,195 --> 00:24:54,580
Speaker 1: well, I don't know what to do about it.

389
00:24:54,620 --> 00:25:09,155
Speaker 1: But at the same time we've got people like this guy and he's not the only one Like they don't want the politicians stepping on their freedom of speech and regulating their industry Except when the regulation makes them more money and then they really really.

390
00:25:09,235 --> 00:25:10,560
Speaker 0: that's how everyone you know.

391
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:21,097
Speaker 0: That's the difference between someone who has a you know political science Principle and someone who just is looking out for their own, you know self-interest right.

392
00:25:21,337 --> 00:25:22,040
Speaker 0: someone like me.

393
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:26,320
Speaker 0: If you ask me a question, right - I'll give you an answer such as you know.

394
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,720
Speaker 0: I don't care what regulation you want, right?

395
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:29,341
Speaker 0: There shouldn't.

396
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:33,860
Speaker 0: there should be less regulation on video games period right, but someone else will come in and they'll be like.

397
00:25:34,221 --> 00:25:42,112
Speaker 0: You know, I don't care about your political principles your ideologies the Constitution, you know, if it's good for me You know, it's good.

398
00:25:42,132 --> 00:25:46,297
Speaker 0: if it's bad for me It's bad like there was a. I was reading a threat in a for a superhero forum.

399
00:25:46,337 --> 00:25:49,047
Speaker 0: and they were like What if there really were vigilantes?

400
00:25:49,348 --> 00:25:54,532
Speaker 0: and a lot of people are like yeah as long as they only go after the criminals Yeah, beat the shit out of them criminals.

401
00:25:54,814 --> 00:25:59,480
Speaker 0: and I'm like How about the principle of you know innocent until proven guilty?

402
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:04,017
Speaker 1: No, but to play the the devil's advocate there are two ways to look at American democracy.

403
00:26:04,318 --> 00:26:15,080
Speaker 1: on one hand there's the political science view of you strive for the Political ideology and political framework where in the reasonable debate and the decision-making can happen.

404
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:32,245
Speaker 1: The other way to look at it is that it is an adversarial system and you should use every instrument provided to you by law within the system to get these specific issue things that you want for your best interest accomplished in the hopes that the varied and competing Self-interest balance out.

405
00:26:32,385 --> 00:26:36,356
Speaker 1: and our government system is based very heavily on that principle.

406
00:26:36,376 --> 00:26:38,000
Speaker 1: I mean look at our balance of powers.

407
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,093
Speaker 1: We have three different branches that each have the power to screw the other two.

408
00:26:41,113 --> 00:26:48,199
Speaker 0: It's like a giant Democratic paper rock scissors Yes, but the two things can work together, you know, if you have a strong do that's called American democracy.

409
00:26:48,641 --> 00:26:53,440
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you have a strong, you know political principle underlying everything.

410
00:26:53,500 --> 00:26:58,241
Speaker 0: There is still plenty of room for debate on specific issues, you know I mean the.

411
00:26:58,622 --> 00:27:01,471
Speaker 0: you know, you say Congress has this power.

412
00:27:01,812 --> 00:27:02,735
Speaker 0: Yes, they do.

413
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,140
Speaker 0: Okay, that question is answered.

414
00:27:04,501 --> 00:27:08,212
Speaker 0: They could still choose to do this or that and you have your you know, your specific issue.

415
00:27:08,232 --> 00:27:09,376
Speaker 0: debate going on.

416
00:27:09,396 --> 00:27:11,751
Speaker 0: - quote.

417
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:24,744
Speaker 1: Perhaps it's my own personal audacity of hope that work here that president-elect Obama will care enough about our industry's plights to create introduce or sign into law legislation that will benefit us as a business.

418
00:27:25,245 --> 00:27:34,120
Speaker 1: or maybe it's audacious enough to suggest that he'll even have the time to address these issues as America tries to pull itself together in the midst of everything that's going wrong.

419
00:27:35,261 --> 00:27:37,330
Speaker 0: How about video games like the last thing on the list?

420
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,980
Speaker 0: and - you're better off writing like your congressman.

421
00:27:40,181 --> 00:27:44,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, Obama doesn't give a shit and there's not much he can do unless Congress does something first.

422
00:27:45,243 --> 00:27:49,080
Speaker 0: Even if this was a good idea, which it is not it's not this who wrote this article.

423
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:49,743
Speaker 1: Give me a second.

424
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:50,828
Speaker 1: who actually wrote this?

425
00:27:50,848 --> 00:27:54,865
Speaker 0: a retard Nick machete Not smart.

426
00:27:55,447 --> 00:28:00,643
Speaker 1: I don't know who Nick machete is and he is the Something something combo.

427
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:09,978
Speaker 1: I give up because it's time for things of the day.

428
00:28:10,038 --> 00:28:10,279
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

429
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:11,100
Speaker 0: Do I have a thing of the day?

430
00:28:11,180 --> 00:28:11,737
Speaker 0: Oh, yes, I do.

431
00:28:12,081 --> 00:28:14,009
Speaker 1: Oh, I got two because they're both kind of lame.

432
00:28:14,310 --> 00:28:16,680
Speaker 1: on one hand the concepts behind them.

433
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,945
Speaker 1: Both are awesome.

434
00:28:18,346 --> 00:28:30,557
Speaker 1: On the other hand the actual reality of what has been done Not so great because I learned one thing almost every Left 4 Dead video on YouTube has stupid music Just like added to it.

435
00:28:32,104 --> 00:28:37,700
Speaker 0: You can remove a word for that sentence and it would still be true every Left 4 Dead on YouTube every video.

436
00:28:40,666 --> 00:28:42,733
Speaker 1: Yeah, but two things stood out.

437
00:28:43,495 --> 00:28:48,611
Speaker 1: one someone remade CS office in Left 4 Dead.

438
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:49,737
Speaker 0: I think that's pretty cool.

439
00:28:49,757 --> 00:28:50,400
Speaker 0: I like that action.

440
00:28:50,541 --> 00:28:53,540
Speaker 0: I want to see more that I want to see as a state on Left 4 Dead.

441
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:56,207
Speaker 1: Yes Cuz remember that mod for CS the zombie mod.

442
00:28:56,227 --> 00:29:09,452
Speaker 1: that was actually very similar to Left 4 Dead and very very a little bit The concept of you got some humans fighting co-op and just hordes and hordes and hordes of aliens Zombies coming at you and you got a hole up and then win.

443
00:29:09,813 --> 00:29:12,520
Speaker 0: Yep, but number two Left 4 Dead and Counter Strike.

444
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:14,547
Speaker 0: You can also tell that you know Counter Strike.

445
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,349
Speaker 0: people don't realize.

446
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:24,200
Speaker 0: Counter Strike originally was a free mod for Half-Life 1 Made by some dudes and then those dudes got bought by valve and that's why Counter Strike isn't free anymore.

447
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,295
Speaker 0: It is clear if you have ever played Counter Strike.

448
00:29:27,316 --> 00:29:30,993
Speaker 0: when you play Left 4 Dead It is clear that the Counter Strike team made Left 4 Dead.

449
00:29:31,013 --> 00:29:31,475
Speaker 0: You can tell.

450
00:29:31,535 --> 00:29:32,480
Speaker 0: by the way the weapons work.

451
00:29:32,944 --> 00:29:34,478
Speaker 0: There is there is no question about it.

452
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:38,098
Speaker 1: But anyway, I saw this and I thought oh that's clever.

453
00:29:38,118 --> 00:29:41,333
Speaker 1: and then I you know I mourn the loss of CS thunder and all these sorts of things.

454
00:29:41,373 --> 00:29:43,944
Speaker 1: but then I thought hey Yeah, this one.

455
00:29:43,984 --> 00:29:47,916
Speaker 0: There's that one map in Left 4 Dead that really reminds me of de vertigo.

456
00:29:47,936 --> 00:29:50,880
Speaker 1: Oh Man, that was the one where I was the tank.

457
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:55,175
Speaker 1: But anyway, and you punch someone off the building punched three people off the building.

458
00:29:55,356 --> 00:29:56,620
Speaker 1: Oh, man, it was great.

459
00:29:57,382 --> 00:30:03,298
Speaker 1: But item two I thought hey we should make a Leroy Jenkins video in Left 4 Dead.

460
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:08,412
Speaker 0: and then I thought You got that whole thing with the witch and everything and the boomer.

461
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:13,760
Speaker 0: if someone just said Leroy Jenkins and ran in and got boomed And then woke the witch up that would totally be funny.

462
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,709
Speaker 1: So what I linked to is the best one that is out there.

463
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:20,220
Speaker 1: someone made up the best Left 4 Dead Leroy Jenkins video.

464
00:30:20,301 --> 00:30:20,764
Speaker 1: That has been.

465
00:30:20,784 --> 00:30:25,552
Speaker 0: it's still not a good video, but it's the best one Yes, so I implore all of you at least smelly poop.

466
00:30:25,933 --> 00:30:36,378
Speaker 1: if you someone out there I don't have time make a Leroy Jenkins Left 4 Dead video But if you do it use the audio from the original one, don't put any music over it.

467
00:30:36,439 --> 00:30:38,346
Speaker 0: Yes Just have some people talking.

468
00:30:38,406 --> 00:30:39,671
Speaker 0: This is how the video goes ready.

469
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:41,859
Speaker 0: Some people are talking right in the game.

470
00:30:42,665 --> 00:30:45,708
Speaker 0: then one guy isn't moving as They're talking.

471
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:48,380
Speaker 0: the guy goes Alright, let's do this Leroy Jenkins.

472
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:50,366
Speaker 0: And he runs out and he wakes up.

473
00:30:50,406 --> 00:30:54,982
Speaker 0: the witch gets boomed and uses a molotov and sets himself on fire all at the same Time.

474
00:30:55,022 --> 00:30:57,280
Speaker 1: now you need the key to their two key elements.

475
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,685
Speaker 1: Well, actually there are three key elements.

476
00:30:58,705 --> 00:31:00,692
Speaker 0: Someone then has to say god damn it Leroy.

477
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,377
Speaker 1: There are exactly three key elements.

478
00:31:02,959 --> 00:31:11,519
Speaker 1: one After he runs in there's a moment of silence of about three seconds Followed by some the guy who was talking saying did he just run in there?

479
00:31:12,881 --> 00:31:21,319
Speaker 1: Two you need as everyone else runs in the shot of Leroy on fire Running back toward the pot getting hit by a witch covered in vomit.

480
00:31:23,261 --> 00:31:25,949
Speaker 1: And three you need the long scene of everyone dying.

481
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:26,631
Speaker 0: Yep.

482
00:31:27,012 --> 00:31:29,278
Speaker 0: Y'all see it's not my fault.

483
00:31:29,318 --> 00:31:31,183
Speaker 1: Yes This I got chicken.

484
00:31:31,564 --> 00:31:33,550
Speaker 1: I got chicken or I'm not chicken.

485
00:31:33,570 --> 00:31:33,991
Speaker 1: I don't know.

486
00:31:34,272 --> 00:31:34,693
Speaker 0: I don't know.

487
00:31:35,174 --> 00:31:36,518
Speaker 1: Ah, remember when Leroy Jenkins.

488
00:31:36,538 --> 00:31:37,059
Speaker 1: It was fresh.

489
00:31:37,701 --> 00:31:44,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember that Otakon where you could walk around Otakon yell Leroy and like a thousand people would yell Jenkins back at you.

490
00:31:44,903 --> 00:31:46,273
Speaker 0: Oh, that was a good Otakon that one.

491
00:31:46,354 --> 00:31:48,506
Speaker 0: Yeah We need some more.

492
00:31:48,546 --> 00:31:51,859
Speaker 0: someone needs to make more memes that have those sort of call-outs in them.

493
00:31:52,241 --> 00:31:55,800
Speaker 0: You know the wherever you can yell something and then someone will say the other part.

494
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:58,534
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, so check out this thing of the day.

495
00:31:58,795 --> 00:32:04,004
Speaker 0: and keeping with my Thanksgiving yummies What do you do on Thanksgiving?

496
00:32:04,645 --> 00:32:06,651
Speaker 1: I eat my weight in Turkey.

497
00:32:07,032 --> 00:32:09,920
Speaker 0: well here you can eat far less than your weight in Turkey.

498
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:11,650
Speaker 0: It's a papercraft turkey.

499
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:12,515
Speaker 0: That's it.

500
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:13,581
Speaker 0: That's it That's.

501
00:32:13,661 --> 00:32:14,584
Speaker 0: it's a papercraft turkey.

502
00:32:14,624 --> 00:32:17,955
Speaker 0: and you know, the best part is has those little chef's hats on the on the drumsticks.

503
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:19,399
Speaker 0: I love those.

504
00:32:20,560 --> 00:32:25,780
Speaker 0: You know, I've never actually seen those in real life, but I keep seeing them like whenever someone draws like a Thanksgiving turkey.

505
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,369
Speaker 0: They always have them but in real life.

506
00:32:27,409 --> 00:32:29,058
Speaker 0: I've never seen one, you know what those are for?

507
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:32,420
Speaker 0: See easier to hold the drumstick without getting your hand dirty.

508
00:32:32,521 --> 00:32:35,619
Speaker 0: Yes, even though I just I just use a napkin you do know.

509
00:32:35,961 --> 00:32:40,220
Speaker 1: Do you realize there are paper towel in Detroit with the Lions on Thanksgiving?

510
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:41,691
Speaker 1: involving a turkey?

511
00:32:43,741 --> 00:32:44,203
Speaker 0: They don't.

512
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:45,568
Speaker 0: they have one at the game or something.

513
00:32:45,608 --> 00:32:46,672
Speaker 1: and well what they do is one.

514
00:32:46,892 --> 00:32:47,836
Speaker 1: there are the traditions.

515
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:49,040
Speaker 1: it's a gaming day.

516
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:50,284
Speaker 1: We don't just talk about video games.

517
00:32:50,525 --> 00:32:50,746
Speaker 1: real.

518
00:32:50,766 --> 00:33:00,560
Speaker 1: briefly the Detroit tradition for Thanksgiving is such one They will have a home game where they wear their old away uniforms the old old old ones.

519
00:33:01,021 --> 00:33:10,865
Speaker 1: Two at halftime, they'll bring out a turkey with end drumsticks attached to it and people bet on how many drumsticks There will be Three.

520
00:33:10,885 --> 00:33:16,636
Speaker 1: they'll be up by at least 14 By the and then lose it in the last eight minutes.

521
00:33:16,656 --> 00:33:19,349
Speaker 0: Well, well rim I have I have some sad news for you.

522
00:33:19,710 --> 00:33:24,148
Speaker 0: You're ready for this sad news number one The Lions so far this year are winless.

523
00:33:24,629 --> 00:33:28,080
Speaker 0: I don't think any NFL team has ever gone the entire season without winning.

524
00:33:28,221 --> 00:33:30,834
Speaker 1: Hey, hey, hey, if anyone can do it we can right.

525
00:33:30,895 --> 00:33:31,136
Speaker 0: well.

526
00:33:31,478 --> 00:33:35,900
Speaker 0: secondly You just said, you know, the Lions are gonna be up and then lose it at the end.

527
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,835
Speaker 1: Oh, they're gonna be up on Thanksgiving.

528
00:33:37,875 --> 00:33:38,319
Speaker 0: They are.

529
00:33:39,401 --> 00:33:42,692
Speaker 0: The Lions are playing this on this Thursday.

530
00:33:42,732 --> 00:33:45,140
Speaker 0: the Tennessee Titans the best team in the AFC.

531
00:33:45,863 --> 00:33:48,915
Speaker 0: They're going to get killed from the start to the end.

532
00:33:48,935 --> 00:33:50,280
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a slaughter.

533
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,209
Speaker 1: I don't think you understand the magic you see.

534
00:33:52,229 --> 00:34:00,276
Speaker 1: the Lions can only do well When they're about to be crushed and the more they're about to be crushed the better they will do in the beginning.

535
00:34:00,778 --> 00:34:08,297
Speaker 0: and the third News is that there is talk going on of ending You know because Detroit sucks so bad and no one wants to watch them.

536
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:08,980
Speaker 0: You're right.

537
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,987
Speaker 0: I mean a guy on the internet.

538
00:34:11,087 --> 00:34:13,817
Speaker 0: a guy on the internet was talking about how he got.

539
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:18,560
Speaker 0: you know You know 50-yard line tickets real close real easily.

540
00:34:18,721 --> 00:34:22,260
Speaker 1: Hey, if I lived in Detroit, I would totally go to Lions games all the time.

541
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:24,768
Speaker 0: Yes, you get the season tickets real deep.

542
00:34:25,090 --> 00:34:27,337
Speaker 1: if you've got a really good sports team.

543
00:34:27,518 --> 00:34:28,100
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

544
00:34:28,581 --> 00:34:33,239
Speaker 1: And if you've got a really bad sports team, it's awesome because you got something to talk about.

545
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:33,521
Speaker 1: Well, you

546
00:34:33,541 --> 00:34:55,933
Speaker 0: have you know, this is like I went way back a few years ago many years ago Actually to a New England Patriots game right when they were kind of good Maybe you know not read not super recently And it was like the first home game that they had lost in a very long time like at that point in time they hadn't lost a home game in like a year or so and I think they might have won the Super Bowl the previous year.

547
00:34:55,953 --> 00:34:56,456
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

548
00:34:56,678 --> 00:35:09,338
Speaker 0: and Like walking out of there because if you ever been to that stadium It's this long road to back to your car and they basically turn the road into a one-way road and then during the game They switch it to one way in the other direction so people get in and out.

549
00:35:10,363 --> 00:35:19,849
Speaker 0: It was just like this quiet like it was like a funeral march out of there, you know, I didn't care I'm a Giants fan what I give a shit, but it was very, you know in Detroit They don't know winnings like.

550
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,460
Speaker 0: so if they won they just wouldn't know what to do.

551
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:26,027
Speaker 0: But when they lose they're just like yeah another loss Thing is they relish in losing.

552
00:35:26,268 --> 00:35:27,351
Speaker 1: the philosophy of Detroit.

553
00:35:27,431 --> 00:35:30,139
Speaker 1: Is that you have to balance good teams with bad teams?

554
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:36,075
Speaker 1: Mmm, that's why the Red Wings and the Pistons are so great because we have the Tigers and the Lions.

555
00:35:36,336 --> 00:35:37,540
Speaker 0: Tigers are middling.

556
00:35:37,881 --> 00:35:39,991
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're better now than they were when I was middling.

557
00:35:40,011 --> 00:35:41,156
Speaker 0: They're not great, but they're middling.

558
00:35:41,276 --> 00:35:43,786
Speaker 1: my god when I was a kid All right left for dead.

559
00:35:43,806 --> 00:35:51,159
Speaker 0: Oh, but there's talk of ending the tradition of letting the Lions Have always the Thanksgiving game and giving it to someone people actually want to see.

560
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,886
Speaker 1: Detroit would riot.

561
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:55,131
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see what happens.

562
00:35:55,372 --> 00:35:58,804
Speaker 1: Anyway left for dead Before we go any further.

563
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:07,840
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say right now if you're looking for the quick review one is great To buy it as soon as possible because it doesn't have staying power.

564
00:36:07,981 --> 00:36:09,508
Speaker 0: That's pretty much what it comes down to.

565
00:36:09,548 --> 00:36:11,818
Speaker 0: left for dead is a great zombie game, you know.

566
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:18,943
Speaker 0: But there is a question as to how long the game will hold our interest, you know, or anyone's interest And I think it's.

567
00:36:18,963 --> 00:36:20,370
Speaker 0: I go from penny arcade agreed.

568
00:36:20,451 --> 00:36:22,160
Speaker 1: I give the game for me personally.

569
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:26,120
Speaker 1: It's got no more than two months to go before I'm done with it.

570
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,533
Speaker 0: I mean the game only has like four campaigns, right?

571
00:36:29,573 --> 00:36:35,492
Speaker 0: So after you do those four campaigns Maybe you can replay them on a harder difficulty level, right.

572
00:36:36,054 --> 00:36:39,528
Speaker 0: and maybe there's two campaigns You can play in versus mode.

573
00:36:39,568 --> 00:36:43,880
Speaker 0: You can't play all four campaigns in versus mode But you can play two of them in versus mode.

574
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:48,839
Speaker 0: So it might be worth it to replay the campaigns both of the ones in versus mode.

575
00:36:50,082 --> 00:36:53,579
Speaker 0: Once you've done that and you've done it all in co-op and such.

576
00:36:54,524 --> 00:36:57,280
Speaker 0: What is there really, you know more to the game?

577
00:36:57,481 --> 00:37:10,730
Speaker 0: Maybe if you decide that you want to play the versus mode competitively and like make a team and Like compete and tournaments or something and some sort of clan thing Maybe they'll have a little bit more replay value.

578
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:13,180
Speaker 1: maybe because it has the one added benefit.

579
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:21,822
Speaker 1: I mean the fact that because you play as a team of four I found that pretty much you'll find a group of four who's really good that you work together with and you'll just play with them All the time.

580
00:37:21,862 --> 00:37:25,820
Speaker 1: so the game really lends itself to team-based, you know pod ladder play.

581
00:37:26,221 --> 00:37:29,834
Speaker 1: However, even if I get into that and there's a tiny chance I will.

582
00:37:29,874 --> 00:37:34,230
Speaker 1: but even if I decide to go all the way I play left for dead like as much as you can play.

583
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,234
Speaker 1: I join the ladders.

584
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:36,940
Speaker 1: I join one of those clans or whatever.

585
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:37,964
Speaker 1: That's gonna be propping up.

586
00:37:37,984 --> 00:37:41,960
Speaker 1: Well, even then I can't see myself playing the game more than six months.

587
00:37:42,191 --> 00:37:51,682
Speaker 0: Yeah there's also you know if user Generated maps start coming out and being easier to play and load up and whatnot like the first I don't know five are gonna be Terrible.

588
00:37:51,803 --> 00:37:58,474
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean people are making the mall from dawn to the dead Which is an obvious idea right, you know that you just saw one.

589
00:37:58,514 --> 00:38:00,100
Speaker 0: That was what DE office, right?

590
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,411
Speaker 0: I'll see us office de office.

591
00:38:02,672 --> 00:38:04,300
Speaker 0: We should make de office be hilarious.

592
00:38:05,003 --> 00:38:09,800
Speaker 0: CS office, you know if enough maps come out maybe can hold your in just a little longer.

593
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:14,660
Speaker 0: Maybe a valve releases some more campaigns, you know, like hey, here's the new campaign.

594
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:20,440
Speaker 0: Even if the new campaign was like five bucks see I would pay five bucks for a full left for dead campaign.

595
00:38:20,682 --> 00:38:21,530
Speaker 1: Here's my worry.

596
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:24,900
Speaker 1: I Mean I didn't play the game until recently.

597
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:27,780
Speaker 1: I actually didn't play it at all until a few night.

598
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:37,800
Speaker 1: You know a couple nights ago a few nights ago where Scott nine to four nights got together And we just went right into the advanced campaign and just kind of trivially went through beating it.

599
00:38:38,420 --> 00:38:40,286
Speaker 1: Well, no difficulty at all.

600
00:38:40,306 --> 00:38:40,768
Speaker 1: Like it didn't.

601
00:38:40,828 --> 00:38:42,072
Speaker 1: even there was no question.

602
00:38:42,112 --> 00:38:44,700
Speaker 0: Nobody died ever because we work together.

603
00:38:44,961 --> 00:38:45,705
Speaker 0: We were all smart.

604
00:38:45,986 --> 00:38:46,910
Speaker 0: None of us had lag.

605
00:38:47,111 --> 00:38:47,995
Speaker 0: We all had skill.

606
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:48,618
Speaker 0: we beat it.

607
00:38:49,140 --> 00:38:50,947
Speaker 1: So obviously we have to just play an expert.

608
00:38:51,007 --> 00:38:54,840
Speaker 1: but the thing is there's a limited number of game mechanics and left for dead.

609
00:38:54,900 --> 00:39:00,846
Speaker 1: I mean, it's basically every map the way it is now because you can't interact with the environment The game really doesn't have enough.

610
00:39:01,147 --> 00:39:02,029
Speaker 1: half-life 2 that's.

611
00:39:02,210 --> 00:39:05,480
Speaker 0: that's really one thing that's bothered me about every source engine game.

612
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,180
Speaker 0: That's Team Fortress 2 counter-strike source and left for dead.

613
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:20,111
Speaker 0: These are all on the source engine right the same source engine that is used in half-life 2 with all the crazy physics of picking Barrels and throwing soda cans and gravity guns right now.

614
00:39:20,211 --> 00:39:23,700
Speaker 0: I understand portal doesn't even have any of the physics engine stuff.

615
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:29,216
Speaker 1: I understand why Team Fortress 2 doesn't because it's this really stateless non narrative kind of.

616
00:39:29,276 --> 00:39:30,580
Speaker 1: well, it's not stateless anymore.

617
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:31,700
Speaker 1: Thank you achievements.

618
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:38,000
Speaker 1: But anyway, it's a game that's supposed to be a direct competition and adding all that stuff would make it a lot fuzzier.

619
00:39:38,221 --> 00:39:40,027
Speaker 1: And the maps, you know, they wouldn't be as clean.

620
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:47,660
Speaker 1: but for a game like this where it's kind of a single-player co-op You know narrative beat the game meet this objective thing.

621
00:39:48,283 --> 00:39:50,011
Speaker 1: It really could be just like a co-op.

622
00:39:50,051 --> 00:39:51,478
Speaker 1: half-life and the read.

623
00:39:51,498 --> 00:39:53,145
Speaker 1: the moment I realized this was it.

624
00:39:53,205 --> 00:39:56,500
Speaker 1: we were playing the dead air campaign we were playing and you have there's this crane.

625
00:39:56,780 --> 00:39:58,563
Speaker 0: remember in half-life 2 there was a crane.

626
00:39:58,603 --> 00:40:04,259
Speaker 0: and what you had to do with this crane is you to pick up a shipping crate and Basically put it down?

627
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:09,575
Speaker 0: No You had to pick up your car and put it down up top where you could.

628
00:40:09,636 --> 00:40:10,920
Speaker 0: you know that way you could drive.

629
00:40:11,883 --> 00:40:12,487
Speaker 1: You know you did.

630
00:40:12,769 --> 00:40:17,490
Speaker 1: first you picked up a cargo container swung it as fast as you could and threw it at some people.

631
00:40:17,791 --> 00:40:21,302
Speaker 1: then you went knocking troops off of bridges and then you swung Stuff around.

632
00:40:21,363 --> 00:40:24,354
Speaker 1: you played there for like a half hour and left for dead the crane.

633
00:40:24,495 --> 00:40:37,620
Speaker 0: you basically get in the crane Pull the lever then you defend the crane from zombies and survive for like a minute or so And then the crane just automatically does its thing and creates a bridge so that you can go to the next area.

634
00:40:38,041 --> 00:40:43,157
Speaker 0: Why can't I use the crane to swing around and knock the zombies off the building?

635
00:40:43,177 --> 00:40:43,840
Speaker 1: just think about that.

636
00:40:44,302 --> 00:40:45,788
Speaker 1: That would have been the best thing ever.

637
00:40:45,969 --> 00:40:54,786
Speaker 1: if in that scene the person who was in the crane Could just start swinging that container around just like knocking zombies off left and right That would have.

638
00:40:55,028 --> 00:40:56,800
Speaker 1: that would have made this game immortal.

639
00:40:57,272 --> 00:41:00,408
Speaker 1: Yeah That would having the half-life if you could.

640
00:41:00,649 --> 00:41:09,740
Speaker 0: you know I mean in this game a good strategy is whenever you especially if you're playing Versus is to close doors behind you because it's zombies can go through doors, but they have to break them first.

641
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:11,522
Speaker 0: So it slows them down You know.

642
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:18,469
Speaker 0: and if someone on the other team decides to spawn behind you and you close the door behind you you can get away from them and force them to.

643
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,879
Speaker 0: you know spawn again or whatever.

644
00:41:19,899 --> 00:41:27,320
Speaker 0: and Imagine if like in half-life 2 you could pick up items and put them down or pick up items and throw them right.

645
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:32,340
Speaker 0: You could pick up items to sort of put them in front of the doors to make little barricades and things.

646
00:41:32,901 --> 00:41:44,440
Speaker 0: Instead you know barricades like just sort of appear on their own like whenever you start a new section of a campaign Like a barricade just appears in the safe room on its own like the people had built it when the screen was.

647
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:45,480
Speaker 1: That's what really bothers me.

648
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:53,554
Speaker 1: I mean it's better from a kind of straight-up gameplay Perspective in that the game is really clean and really simple and really predictable.

649
00:41:53,594 --> 00:42:03,358
Speaker 1: I mean and this adds a lot of atmosphere I mean you have the different musical cues when different things are about to happen and You kind of you go into every game expecting certain things.

650
00:42:03,419 --> 00:42:19,939
Speaker 1: but Because of that and because it's basically just a pop-up book with zombie fights I mean you go to a place you hit the button to make the pop-up book thing happen And then you do the fight and then you move on hit the next pop-up book thing And you know every map is go in there's gonna be smokers and boomers and things.

651
00:42:20,924 --> 00:42:23,275
Speaker 1: Oh now here's the part where we fight the tank and then we continue.

652
00:42:23,295 --> 00:42:24,079
Speaker 1: you're waiting for it.

653
00:42:24,864 --> 00:42:40,158
Speaker 1: You can only make so many campaigns Where until you've exhausted every possible novel game mechanic that the game presents and then the only thing a campaign can add is Narrative and color and at that point the game's not gonna have anything else to offer.

654
00:42:40,178 --> 00:42:44,000
Speaker 0: to most people I mean the one thing the game does have is the so-called director.

655
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:50,060
Speaker 0: You know the AI director where you know the game plays it up like each campaign is a movie and you're acting in the movie.

656
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:53,512
Speaker 0: You know the zombie movie, and you know the directors sort of.

657
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:55,800
Speaker 0: you know change every time you play a campaign.

658
00:42:55,840 --> 00:42:59,062
Speaker 0: It's not exactly the same like if you play half-life 2 The.

659
00:42:59,163 --> 00:43:02,915
Speaker 0: there's the same number of bad guys in every spot every time.

660
00:43:02,935 --> 00:43:03,918
Speaker 1: you know this idea.

661
00:43:03,979 --> 00:43:08,113
Speaker 0: room Always has one of those poison headcrabs in it.

662
00:43:08,174 --> 00:43:17,511
Speaker 1: this idea was brilliant because it Lets the game even if you play through a campaign a second time Keep that kind of aura of suspense that you can't mean.

663
00:43:17,792 --> 00:43:23,632
Speaker 1: if it was exactly the same every time like most FPS Has been up to this point it would it would be the game of.

664
00:43:23,812 --> 00:43:25,739
Speaker 1: I memorized it and I can speedrun it.

665
00:43:26,002 --> 00:43:26,176
Speaker 0: Yep.

666
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:31,455
Speaker 0: But no the director sort of changes the flow of the game as you go on.

667
00:43:31,495 --> 00:43:37,029
Speaker 0: so like you sit in one place and don't move like Zombies will sort of keep coming at you.

668
00:43:37,110 --> 00:43:39,740
Speaker 0: if you don't start moving you know they'll be like another flood of zombies.

669
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,403
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

670
00:43:40,463 --> 00:43:43,717
Speaker 0: You one of them saw you right, or you know maybe sometime.

671
00:43:43,757 --> 00:43:44,400
Speaker 0: You'll go through.

672
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,607
Speaker 0: There'll be a witch in this spot, but maybe the witch will be in a different spot Or maybe there won't be a witch.

673
00:43:48,627 --> 00:43:49,230
Speaker 0: There'll be a tank.

674
00:43:49,250 --> 00:43:50,216
Speaker 0: Maybe there'll be two tanks.

675
00:43:50,276 --> 00:43:54,339
Speaker 0: Maybe yeah, and It's sort of the game throws.

676
00:43:54,742 --> 00:43:58,860
Speaker 0: You know the bad guys at you as if there was a director.

677
00:43:59,342 --> 00:44:04,040
Speaker 0: You know a real director sort of deciding and controlling the flow of the action.

678
00:44:04,120 --> 00:44:06,428
Speaker 0: But it's just an AI controlling the flow of the action.

679
00:44:06,468 --> 00:44:13,731
Speaker 1: the game does a really good job of keeping the atmosphere Right and balancing hectic times with quiet scary times.

680
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:18,545
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if you play an expert those a lot less quiet times Yeah, but an advanced.

681
00:44:18,585 --> 00:44:24,756
Speaker 0: you know that at least the balance for cinematic purposes is just right But it's not hard enough, and we just beat it every time.

682
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:35,580
Speaker 1: yeah But I just I feel like there's so little long-term play the game has to offer that even if they have DLC I'm using it downloadable content, and I can buy campaigns.

683
00:44:36,521 --> 00:44:48,480
Speaker 1: I feel like every the campaigns that came with the game have already exhausted every possible game mechanic unless they add Game mechanics, and they would need to make campaigns that were sort of different or longer or better.

684
00:44:48,761 --> 00:44:54,020
Speaker 0: Or I mean the other thing that gets me out the campaigns is that they're a little bit like too linear.

685
00:44:54,301 --> 00:45:01,287
Speaker 0: I mean sometimes you have a choice of like go the back way or go the front way But you don't really have a choice.

686
00:45:01,327 --> 00:45:09,418
Speaker 0: like I want like have a campaign where maybe if I go I can like You know get to a boat or maybe if I go this way we can get to a train or me.

687
00:45:10,522 --> 00:45:17,446
Speaker 0: Or maybe there's like a vehicle we can ride in or we can sort of take the rooftops Maybe like a big decision.

688
00:45:17,486 --> 00:45:21,800
Speaker 0: that way even a single campaign has a lot of replay value, and that's another thing.

689
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:22,865
Speaker 0: Where is the vehicle?

690
00:45:22,885 --> 00:45:25,859
Speaker 0: I mean usually people go our vehicle mission?

691
00:45:26,620 --> 00:45:27,904
Speaker 0: Zombie needs a vehicle mission.

692
00:45:28,366 --> 00:45:30,011
Speaker 0: Oh, no game needs a vehicle mission.

693
00:45:30,412 --> 00:45:32,880
Speaker 0: one guy drives the van everyone else shoots out the sides.

694
00:45:33,141 --> 00:45:33,723
Speaker 0: Where is it?

695
00:45:34,004 --> 00:45:35,028
Speaker 1: I can't find that would be great.

696
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:37,056
Speaker 1: because think about here's the cinematic scene you set up.

697
00:45:37,438 --> 00:45:43,934
Speaker 1: you get in the van you start driving a Tank runs up from the side and knocks the van the fuck over.

698
00:45:44,155 --> 00:45:45,580
Speaker 0: Oh, that's hot you're in it.

699
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:56,451
Speaker 0: everything is chaos and spinning and the only thing is this one scene where you come out into the back of this garage and Francis goes I hate vans Every time I go into that room.

700
00:45:56,512 --> 00:46:00,876
Speaker 0: I go I hate vans Just to demonstrate that I've memorized the line.

701
00:46:00,896 --> 00:46:01,841
Speaker 1: That's the other thing I like.

702
00:46:02,082 --> 00:46:04,389
Speaker 1: the characters are great like the.

703
00:46:04,409 --> 00:46:05,252
Speaker 1: they're pretty good.

704
00:46:05,373 --> 00:46:18,860
Speaker 1: the cinematics of the game like the opening movie Is brilliant because on one hand it's a pretty good zombie movie in and of itself and it on the other hand it introduces the characters the plot and every single game mechanic.

705
00:46:19,823 --> 00:46:21,367
Speaker 1: Like right then you watch that opening movie.

706
00:46:21,668 --> 00:46:23,113
Speaker 1: You know what all the zombie types are.

707
00:46:23,494 --> 00:46:25,460
Speaker 1: you know what to do about them?

708
00:46:25,801 --> 00:46:27,220
Speaker 1: You know all the game mechanics.

709
00:46:27,461 --> 00:46:29,166
Speaker 1: You know what pipe bombs do.

710
00:46:29,768 --> 00:46:32,096
Speaker 1: it's basically a tutorial that doesn't act like a tutorial.

711
00:46:32,316 --> 00:46:33,139
Speaker 1: more games need that.

712
00:46:34,142 --> 00:46:36,226
Speaker 0: Another thing that is sort of weird though.

713
00:46:36,246 --> 00:46:41,920
Speaker 0: while the game has these four characters right Zoey Francis Bill and Lewis, right?

714
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,258
Speaker 0: And they sort of fit the stereo.

715
00:46:45,363 --> 00:46:54,693
Speaker 0: Lewis in a zombie movie, you know the grizzled vet the biker dude the token black guy and the girl You know typical zombie movie.

716
00:46:54,733 --> 00:46:55,798
Speaker 0: That's that's how it goes.

717
00:46:57,422 --> 00:47:01,220
Speaker 0: You let you choose which character you want to be but it doesn't really make a difference.

718
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,828
Speaker 0: They're all exactly the same.

719
00:47:02,868 --> 00:47:04,175
Speaker 0: They all move at the same speed.

720
00:47:04,215 --> 00:47:05,200
Speaker 0: They have the same HP.

721
00:47:05,461 --> 00:47:07,740
Speaker 0: They have the same, you know, you pick whatever weapon you want.

722
00:47:08,145 --> 00:47:14,693
Speaker 0: They're all the same accuracy And I think that was a missed opportunity to increase the replay value even more.

723
00:47:14,774 --> 00:47:17,380
Speaker 0: if the characters were different in some way.

724
00:47:17,742 --> 00:47:29,150
Speaker 0: you know, maybe the grizzled vet is better aim and Maybe Francis has better melee attacks And it's harder for like smokers to grab him or something.

725
00:47:29,411 --> 00:47:40,816
Speaker 0: or you know Lewis can carry a lot more stuff and Maybe the girl is faster and she can duck and maybe roll or jump farther and stuff like that, you know What?

726
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:44,293
Speaker 1: Black zombie killer needs med pack badly.

727
00:47:44,675 --> 00:47:53,322
Speaker 0: No, okay You know that would have increased the replay value fourfold because I'd want to play through is each character Each time.

728
00:47:53,362 --> 00:48:00,040
Speaker 1: but now that little thing even if they were really really really subtle differences would have just added that feeling.

729
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:05,622
Speaker 0: Yeah, like one person can carry two med packs one person carry a little bit more ammo, you know Just a little.

730
00:48:05,682 --> 00:48:08,433
Speaker 0: even it was a little tiny difference between the characters.

731
00:48:08,694 --> 00:48:10,100
Speaker 0: It would make a big difference in the game.

732
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:22,302
Speaker 1: Hey, if only someone could make a mod where it's just you play Left 4 Dead, but you pick everyone picks a Team Fortress 2 class Yeah, and you just go I don't know.

733
00:48:22,322 --> 00:48:24,711
Speaker 0: I just pick the scout and run to the safe room and close the door.

734
00:48:24,731 --> 00:48:27,402
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

735
00:48:27,502 --> 00:48:29,939
Speaker 1: engineer could be fun everyone could be fun except the spy.

736
00:48:30,402 --> 00:48:32,694
Speaker 0: Well, I think the heavy would get owned.

737
00:48:32,915 --> 00:48:33,719
Speaker 0: he wouldn't have a chance.

738
00:48:34,061 --> 00:48:37,020
Speaker 0: I mean, he'd mow him down, but then he would get overrun.

739
00:48:39,443 --> 00:48:40,327
Speaker 1: But I don't know the game.

740
00:48:40,407 --> 00:48:43,280
Speaker 1: the single-player game is not gonna have staying power.

741
00:48:43,381 --> 00:48:52,200
Speaker 1: So that's why I said if you want to play this game Play it now because everyone who's into it now the player base is gonna drop off like a rock within a year.

742
00:48:52,602 --> 00:48:55,440
Speaker 1: This is gonna be one of those situations where if you weren't in at the ground floor.

743
00:48:56,002 --> 00:49:04,860
Speaker 1: You're really gonna miss out because by the time you decide to play a year from now No one's gonna be playing and no one's gonna be if you get say the 360 version, right?

744
00:49:04,941 --> 00:49:06,939
Speaker 0: You can play it with people in your house.

745
00:49:07,181 --> 00:49:15,580
Speaker 0: So if you have friends who also haven't played it and you can get them together All you need is four people and if you've got four people that haven't played you can play anytime.

746
00:49:16,102 --> 00:49:25,620
Speaker 0: But if you want to play it with the people who are playing it now, right the people who got into ground floor The we're gonna be bored of this game in like a month or so, and then we're not gonna play it anymore.

747
00:49:25,780 --> 00:49:33,783
Speaker 0: So if you want to play, you know you with co-op with and you don't have three friends who also have not played You.

748
00:49:33,823 --> 00:49:36,478
Speaker 0: now is the time you got to pay the 50 bucks and get on that.

749
00:49:37,720 --> 00:49:40,654
Speaker 0: Also, you know that there is a 360 and ps3.

750
00:49:40,674 --> 00:49:41,397
Speaker 0: I think this is a ps3.

751
00:49:41,518 --> 00:49:41,960
Speaker 0: I don't know.

752
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:46,607
Speaker 0: there's definitely a 360 version and Really though you should play the PC version.

753
00:49:46,908 --> 00:49:48,031
Speaker 1: Yeah, you definitely should.

754
00:49:48,573 --> 00:49:52,940
Speaker 0: yeah, you know the 360 version people There's other problems with it.

755
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:57,136
Speaker 0: And also, you know valve just tends to give a lot more respect to.

756
00:49:57,176 --> 00:50:03,079
Speaker 0: I mean think about this Right the demo for left 4 dead got three patches in one day.

757
00:50:03,079 --> 00:50:06,506
Speaker 0: 360 version Didn't get shit, right?

758
00:50:06,868 --> 00:50:10,280
Speaker 0: So the PC is where the love is gonna be from valve.

759
00:50:10,340 --> 00:50:12,372
Speaker 0: This is where you're gonna get your extra maps.

760
00:50:12,432 --> 00:50:13,740
Speaker 0: This is where you're gonna get your mods.

761
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:15,798
Speaker 0: This is where you're gonna get all the good stuff.

762
00:50:15,838 --> 00:50:28,929
Speaker 0: So Really any valve game you should play on the PC, you know get steam just go Play on the 360. unless you don't have a good PC and you do have a 360 There's really no reason to get that version plus.

763
00:50:29,712 --> 00:50:31,640
Speaker 0: the 360 version is more money.

764
00:50:31,981 --> 00:50:34,428
Speaker 0: I mean, I pre-ordered the PC version for $45.

765
00:50:34,428 --> 00:50:36,474
Speaker 0: the 360 version is $60 and you're getting less.

766
00:50:39,125 --> 00:50:39,708
Speaker 0: What the hell?

767
00:50:40,352 --> 00:50:40,674
Speaker 0: I don't know.

768
00:50:41,238 --> 00:50:41,580
Speaker 1: All right.

769
00:50:41,741 --> 00:50:54,920
Speaker 1: So before we really talk about the multiplayer We need to tell the tale of the because the first time I ever played multiplayer Was right after the first time I'd ever played the game which was the game that I'm talking about right now?

770
00:50:54,940 --> 00:50:55,625
Speaker 1: it was me and Scott.

771
00:50:55,645 --> 00:50:56,612
Speaker 1: and who was it who was with us?

772
00:50:56,854 --> 00:51:00,062
Speaker 0: classic and Someone else.

773
00:51:00,484 --> 00:51:01,928
Speaker 0: All right, remind me someone else.

774
00:51:01,968 --> 00:51:02,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, you guys were.

775
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,680
Speaker 0: maybe it was Tay Dan pilot or bronze dragon?

776
00:51:05,961 --> 00:51:07,448
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't remember.

777
00:51:07,549 --> 00:51:09,337
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's some people playing with us.

778
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:09,820
Speaker 0: They're all cool.

779
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:11,379
Speaker 1: Yeah, and there are people on the opposite team.

780
00:51:11,480 --> 00:51:16,720
Speaker 1: But we know we decide to play the versus because we've played out the single-player right then and we're feeling it.

781
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:17,710
Speaker 1: We got a good group going.

782
00:51:18,013 --> 00:51:24,052
Speaker 1: Well the color Well, I call it the single-player because it's basically while it's a co-op game.

783
00:51:24,534 --> 00:51:26,740
Speaker 1: It's really plays like a single-player game.

784
00:51:26,921 --> 00:51:30,238
Speaker 1: Yep, I mean your friends are basically just advanced AI.

785
00:51:31,763 --> 00:51:34,338
Speaker 0: Well, they talk to you, which is nice occasionally.

786
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:38,393
Speaker 1: But so we decide to play the verses and the verses works.

787
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:44,180
Speaker 1: Okay, I mean, it's it's really The verse is pretty clever it is but it's not super fun to play at the zombies.

788
00:51:45,041 --> 00:51:48,698
Speaker 0: well, the thing is is the way that the verses works just for people who don't know.

789
00:51:48,718 --> 00:51:55,160
Speaker 0: is It's not like some other zombie games where it's like, oh you're a survivor, but you get bit and you turn into a zombie?

790
00:51:55,223 --> 00:52:06,020
Speaker 0: No, no You have a team of four people who are the survivors and they're trying to beat the mission as you know as they would In a normal game and then the other four people are the zombies.

791
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:17,619
Speaker 0: They're basically instead of the AI director controlling the smokers and other specialized zombies you have humans controlling the specialized zombies just not the witch though, but the other ones.

792
00:52:17,860 --> 00:52:31,269
Speaker 0: and you know basically You're trying to get to the end as quickly as possible and with the most health as possible and the zombies are Trying to make as hard as possible for the other team.

793
00:52:31,309 --> 00:52:35,140
Speaker 0: and then after one team does you know does their thing?

794
00:52:35,461 --> 00:52:37,349
Speaker 0: Succeeds or fails you switch.

795
00:52:37,951 --> 00:52:40,120
Speaker 0: so it's basically who can you know?

796
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:45,258
Speaker 0: play the game better as survivors and who can make the game harder for the survivors as zombies.

797
00:52:45,479 --> 00:52:49,500
Speaker 0: and So it's sort of team versus team at playing the normal game.

798
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:55,502
Speaker 1: It's really I can't come up with a better way to handle it and it works really really well It was.

799
00:52:55,543 --> 00:52:57,311
Speaker 0: it was a clever idea that I would not have come up with.

800
00:52:57,331 --> 00:52:58,236
Speaker 0: the only problem.

801
00:52:58,376 --> 00:53:06,300
Speaker 1: Is that basically if You're good at the game You will not have fun because the majority of people are bad at the game.

802
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:13,339
Speaker 0: And yeah, every time I played a game well, I tried to play versus just by joining online games with people strangers.

803
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:23,631
Speaker 0: and Every time I was either on a team that was so good We just won on a team that was most of the time I was at a team that was so shitty I couldn't win no matter how good I was.

804
00:53:23,933 --> 00:53:24,577
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all.

805
00:53:24,617 --> 00:53:28,460
Speaker 1: in general This is really a game where playing with strangers is not reward.

806
00:53:28,561 --> 00:53:30,940
Speaker 1: I mean you can play with strangers and you can make friends and all that.

807
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:41,269
Speaker 1: but if you really want to enjoy this game You really should play it with friends of yours or like of the set group of people or have like a circle of maybe 12 Friends who all take turns playing with each other.

808
00:53:41,330 --> 00:53:58,653
Speaker 1: because if you're not playing with friends You're gonna miss most of the magic of this game Mm-hmm, but in terms of the multiplayer the four of us went into the multiplayer against four other people and I think we were the zombies first and They didn't make it 20 feet out that safe room door.

809
00:53:58,915 --> 00:53:59,920
Speaker 0: They didn't make it at all.

810
00:54:00,782 --> 00:54:06,340
Speaker 1: I think the saddest part was when their score broke double digits because they had us their score.

811
00:54:06,444 --> 00:54:16,583
Speaker 0: basically You get a score based on how much health and how far you got through the level and how difficult the level was and all These factors and their score was like ding ding ding ding eight Eleven.

812
00:54:16,603 --> 00:54:26,706
Speaker 1: I was like no they broke into double digits those fuckers This is our turn and we literally just kind of run at full speed through the map killing all the zombies straight for the exit Taking no damage.

813
00:54:26,726 --> 00:54:27,149
Speaker 1: We got 4,000 points.

814
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:35,473
Speaker 0: Yep So so Another problem right is that this happens.

815
00:54:35,533 --> 00:54:37,240
Speaker 0: right one team is good one team is bad.

816
00:54:37,341 --> 00:54:38,266
Speaker 0: So what happens here?

817
00:54:38,769 --> 00:54:40,480
Speaker 0: people on the team that is losing?

818
00:54:41,180 --> 00:54:43,351
Speaker 0: Leave because it's not fun to lose.

819
00:54:43,491 --> 00:54:46,283
Speaker 1: everyone on the losing team quit Immediately.

820
00:54:46,303 --> 00:54:50,014
Speaker 1: except for bronze dragon you get mad props for sticking to the end.

821
00:54:50,034 --> 00:54:52,523
Speaker 0: He had wicked lag - yeah, right Here's another.

822
00:54:52,543 --> 00:54:53,307
Speaker 0: here's some of his.

823
00:54:53,368 --> 00:55:01,800
Speaker 0: the problems that fold out of this problem Number one, if you join a game online randomly, where are there going to be empty slots on losing teams?

824
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:06,124
Speaker 0: Alright teams that have just and which means you're against a good team Which means you're gonna lose.

825
00:55:06,385 --> 00:55:08,012
Speaker 0: you can't carry the team on your own.

826
00:55:08,052 --> 00:55:09,880
Speaker 0: You need three other good players.

827
00:55:10,582 --> 00:55:22,040
Speaker 0: Problem number two if you're a winning team a winning team spends a lot of time playing as survivors Because they probably make it to the end of the level and when they're zombies they end it real quick.

828
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:26,270
Speaker 0: So a winning team plays a lot of survivor and very little zombie.

829
00:55:26,511 --> 00:55:30,260
Speaker 0: a losing team plays very little survivor and a lot of zombie.

830
00:55:31,041 --> 00:55:36,225
Speaker 0: Zombies can be fun, you know smoking people and you know barfing on people and all that good stuff We get.

831
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:49,248
Speaker 0: being the tank is super fun but when you're the zombies right you're spending a lot of time dying because you die very quickly and Trying to find a spot to spawn Waiting to enter spawn mode.

832
00:55:49,690 --> 00:55:51,960
Speaker 0: It's it's more boring overall.

833
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,909
Speaker 0: There's a lot of waiting and a lot of doing nothing.

834
00:55:53,929 --> 00:55:55,255
Speaker 0: Where's in your survivor?

835
00:55:55,275 --> 00:55:56,280
Speaker 0: You're playing constantly.

836
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:57,812
Speaker 1: Let's imagine how on the phone it'll be.

837
00:55:57,832 --> 00:55:58,900
Speaker 1: you're playing against a good team.

838
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:04,860
Speaker 1: So basically they see you you die you grab someone you have to wait 30 seconds before you can play again.

839
00:56:06,082 --> 00:56:13,580
Speaker 0: Then you see then you join you spawn you attack Maybe you get some damage on you die you wait 30 seconds to do it again.

840
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:23,077
Speaker 1: So really the only way to play the multiplayer Where it's fun is either to form a team of four and play against another formed team of four.

841
00:56:23,337 --> 00:56:24,159
Speaker 1: that will not rage.

842
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:24,400
Speaker 1: quit.

843
00:56:24,862 --> 00:56:25,765
Speaker 0: that is also good.

844
00:56:25,785 --> 00:56:31,651
Speaker 1: or at least similar in skill level or Join the professional ladder play.

845
00:56:31,953 --> 00:56:32,737
Speaker 0: Yeah or something.

846
00:56:32,798 --> 00:56:33,099
Speaker 0: I don't know.

847
00:56:34,083 --> 00:56:36,580
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's that's a serious flaw in the versus.

848
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,655
Speaker 1: I gotta say that the versus mode is pretty fun when it when it works Be in the tank and that vertigo map was like the best thing ever.

849
00:56:44,097 --> 00:56:44,740
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

850
00:56:45,425 --> 00:56:47,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's another flaw in the verses.

851
00:56:47,260 --> 00:56:49,390
Speaker 1: I just run up to a survivor and I'm like punk.

852
00:56:49,470 --> 00:56:51,740
Speaker 0: and just so let's say you're playing versus mode.

853
00:56:51,801 --> 00:56:53,333
Speaker 0: Right, and it's four on four.

854
00:56:53,354 --> 00:56:57,111
Speaker 0: All right You have to in order to win as the zombies.

855
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,700
Speaker 0: You need to kill all four of the other players.

856
00:57:00,561 --> 00:57:03,048
Speaker 0: Let's say it's four on one in versus mode.

857
00:57:03,289 --> 00:57:03,630
Speaker 0: All right.

858
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,800
Speaker 0: Well, it's one real player and three AI players.

859
00:57:07,442 --> 00:57:10,913
Speaker 0: You only have to kill the real player and then you win.

860
00:57:11,214 --> 00:57:20,680
Speaker 0: so it's actually completely unfair Because you know if you have less players you are an extreme disadvantage to where three of your players don't even count.

861
00:57:20,781 --> 00:57:22,600
Speaker 0: Just one of them dies and it's game over.

862
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:28,361
Speaker 1: Well, I think the idea is that you're only gonna have AI there temporarily until someone else joins your losing team and then rage Quits.

863
00:57:28,602 --> 00:57:29,044
Speaker 0: Yeah.

864
00:57:29,525 --> 00:57:31,272
Speaker 1: Yeah rage quitting is a big problem.

865
00:57:31,492 --> 00:57:32,215
Speaker 1: So it is.

866
00:57:32,636 --> 00:57:33,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

867
00:57:33,881 --> 00:57:34,989
Speaker 1: I mean, what can I say?

868
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:41,609
Speaker 1: the game is really fun, but it has enough flaws to where I'm not gonna be playing this come February.

869
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,275
Speaker 0: No, but I'm glad I bought it.

870
00:57:43,415 --> 00:57:44,800
Speaker 0: I am actually playing it.

871
00:57:44,980 --> 00:57:46,626
Speaker 0: Yes, you know more so than other games.

872
00:57:46,707 --> 00:57:55,160
Speaker 0: I am and I'm not playing Bioshock or Fallout 3 or any other games I bought recently, but I am I'm playing Left 4 Dead and I'm playing NS sort of in equal doses.

873
00:57:56,121 --> 00:57:57,988
Speaker 0: The only thing is I think a couple months from now.

874
00:57:58,048 --> 00:58:01,120
Speaker 0: I'll still be playing NS, but I won't still be playing Left 4 Dead.

875
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,912
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is think about how much staying power NS has had.

876
00:58:04,273 --> 00:58:09,375
Speaker 1: we've been playing NS continuously for six years.

877
00:58:09,677 --> 00:58:12,905
Speaker 1: Yep Six years now.

878
00:58:13,547 --> 00:58:14,289
Speaker 0: That's a long time.

879
00:58:14,329 --> 00:58:15,914
Speaker 0: Left 4 Dead is not a six year game.

880
00:58:16,275 --> 00:58:18,765
Speaker 1: Left 4 Dead is not a six month game I want to make a.

881
00:58:18,866 --> 00:58:21,100
Speaker 0: I want to make a parody of Left 4 Dead called Right to Live.

882
00:58:24,342 --> 00:58:25,728
Speaker 1: What kind of game is that gonna be?

883
00:58:26,149 --> 00:58:28,720
Speaker 0: It's gonna be a zombie trying to turn back into human.

884
00:58:29,922 --> 00:58:34,040
Speaker 1: So what you run up to humans going please help and then they shoot you.

885
00:58:37,801 --> 00:59:04,360
Speaker 1: Though I have to give a very important public service announcement and I mean this with all the love I can Because this is a dear friend of mine One of the chorus and most stalwart members of the front row crew the spine that was forged in steel and iron the man who gave us cowboy bebop, but Scott Johnson is Possibly the most dangerous person to ever have on your team in Left 4 Dead.

886
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:08,313
Speaker 0: He's terrible now for someone who likes zombies and zombie movies.

887
00:59:08,353 --> 00:59:10,500
Speaker 0: so much for someone who will talk.

888
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:14,220
Speaker 0: You know who loves doing the old zombie survival discussions.

889
00:59:15,361 --> 00:59:16,947
Speaker 0: He's really bad at Left 4 Dead.

890
00:59:17,007 --> 00:59:18,191
Speaker 1: I love you Scott Johnson.

891
00:59:18,231 --> 00:59:18,954
Speaker 0: You're terrible.

892
00:59:18,974 --> 00:59:22,891
Speaker 1: No, I love you, but Well, I hadn't even played Left 4 Dead yet.

893
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:24,700
Speaker 1: I didn't even know how it worked.

894
00:59:24,760 --> 00:59:25,803
Speaker 1: I hadn't read anything done.

895
00:59:25,863 --> 00:59:26,184
Speaker 1: anything.

896
00:59:26,705 --> 00:59:28,310
Speaker 1: Scott's playing in his room.

897
00:59:28,831 --> 00:59:30,576
Speaker 1: I walk in me and Emily are standing there watching.

898
00:59:31,258 --> 00:59:32,662
Speaker 1: we see Scott.

899
00:59:33,164 --> 00:59:35,853
Speaker 1: he sees a witch and yeah, I see the witch on Scott's screen.

900
00:59:35,873 --> 00:59:37,117
Speaker 1: and Scott says hey everyone.

901
00:59:37,137 --> 00:59:38,020
Speaker 1: There's a witch right here.

902
00:59:38,100 --> 00:59:38,762
Speaker 1: I'm looking at it.

903
00:59:39,364 --> 00:59:40,085
Speaker 1: Just walk past it.

904
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:40,807
Speaker 1: It won't notice us.

905
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:42,331
Speaker 1: Scott backs away.

906
00:59:42,392 --> 00:59:43,114
Speaker 1: He turns around.

907
00:59:43,715 --> 00:59:44,778
Speaker 1: we see Scott Johnson.

908
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:50,879
Speaker 1: go Run straight for the witch stand on top of it and start shooting it.

909
00:59:52,702 --> 00:59:54,139
Speaker 1: Luckily Scott shot him dead.

910
00:59:54,840 --> 01:00:00,840
Speaker 0: Yep, I kept my word and I shot Scott Johnson dead because I was role-playing.

911
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:04,740
Speaker 0: You know, that is one thing that Left 4 Dead actually has is role-playing ability, right?

912
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,836
Speaker 1: Oh, there are a lot of people who will role-play in the game.

913
01:00:07,876 --> 01:00:08,480
Speaker 1: It's kind of cool.

914
01:00:08,660 --> 01:00:11,591
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's some videos of it of like good people doing it.

915
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:15,425
Speaker 0: Well also there and I basically said holy shit This guy is dangerous.

916
01:00:15,465 --> 01:00:19,260
Speaker 0: He may be not a zombie, but he's going up and waking up witches.

917
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:24,777
Speaker 0: This is not someone that I can be with and I shot him dead because this friendly fire in the game Which is totally cool.

918
01:00:26,741 --> 01:00:29,211
Speaker 0: Then right playing with Scott we're playing a game.

919
01:00:29,231 --> 01:00:30,436
Speaker 1: Well, he's not easy.

920
01:00:30,476 --> 01:00:31,540
Speaker 1: He appeared out of nowhere.

921
01:00:31,620 --> 01:00:35,320
Speaker 1: He's kind of like the tank you're playing a game and suddenly there's Scott Johnson.

922
01:00:35,320 --> 01:00:40,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were playing and someone in our you know party dropped out and Scott Johnson just sort of joined in on his own.

923
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:41,904
Speaker 1: Immediately, we didn't know the way.

924
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:46,840
Speaker 0: steam has pretty good handling of the friends steam system and integration with Left 4 Dead.

925
01:00:47,302 --> 01:00:51,940
Speaker 0: So if you have friends on Steam, it's very easy to get into games of Left 4 Dead with them and that's great.

926
01:00:52,483 --> 01:00:57,788
Speaker 0: So Scott Johnson used that ability to join our Ability to kill us all.

927
01:00:57,988 --> 01:01:03,526
Speaker 1: basically if I was role-playing our game of life words would have been Scott Right, you've killed us all.

928
01:01:03,626 --> 01:01:04,349
Speaker 0: so he joins.

929
01:01:04,529 --> 01:01:07,700
Speaker 0: he joins this game of Left 4 Dead that we're playing and this me rim and classic.

930
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:08,765
Speaker 0: We're doing great.

931
01:01:09,288 --> 01:01:11,860
Speaker 1: I think the game Scott Johnson was playing was not Left 4 Dead.

932
01:01:12,161 --> 01:01:12,885
Speaker 1: He was playing.

933
01:01:13,367 --> 01:01:15,054
Speaker 1: how much damage to the party?

934
01:01:15,094 --> 01:01:15,817
Speaker 1: Can I do in 20 sec?

935
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:16,942
Speaker 0: So the first.

936
01:01:17,082 --> 01:01:18,066
Speaker 0: so he comes in.

937
01:01:18,106 --> 01:01:18,869
Speaker 0: he's playing normally.

938
01:01:18,889 --> 01:01:19,612
Speaker 0: he's playing normally.

939
01:01:19,712 --> 01:01:22,502
Speaker 0: the first thing he does he comes up and he starts to Heal me now.

940
01:01:22,844 --> 01:01:23,727
Speaker 1: I had yellow health.

941
01:01:23,948 --> 01:01:27,260
Speaker 0: Everyone else had green, but I still had like 30-something health.

942
01:01:27,361 --> 01:01:28,466
Speaker 0: I did not need healing yet.

943
01:01:28,768 --> 01:01:29,592
Speaker 0: He starts healing me.

944
01:01:29,693 --> 01:01:31,000
Speaker 0: I'm like get the fuck off of me.

945
01:01:31,040 --> 01:01:32,690
Speaker 0: I don't want your stupid healing get off.

946
01:01:33,173 --> 01:01:34,400
Speaker 0: There's no way to get him off of you.

947
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,062
Speaker 0: I tried to shoot.

948
01:01:35,082 --> 01:01:37,390
Speaker 0: there was no way to make him stop.

949
01:01:37,410 --> 01:01:40,119
Speaker 0: He wasted one of our health packs too early by healing.

950
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:40,764
Speaker 1: now That's fine.

951
01:01:40,784 --> 01:01:44,703
Speaker 1: I mean, that's not too bad Whatever cuz?

952
01:01:44,743 --> 01:01:46,108
Speaker 1: I mean I've wasted molotovs.

953
01:01:46,148 --> 01:01:48,637
Speaker 1: I waste things all the time, but well I waste mother sometimes.

954
01:01:48,697 --> 01:01:51,394
Speaker 0: but the fact that Scott health packs a little more precious.

955
01:01:51,434 --> 01:01:56,152
Speaker 1: Scott Johnson Immediately after doing this like literally you you join the game.

956
01:01:56,493 --> 01:02:03,240
Speaker 1: you waste the health pack and then you turn Toward a boomer and basically jump it as fast as possible.

957
01:02:03,923 --> 01:02:07,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a. there was a ladder and there's a boomer coming up the ladder.

958
01:02:07,547 --> 01:02:16,736
Speaker 0: I saw it there So I hit it with the melee attack and I back and it fell down the ladder and I started to back off and I Pulled out my pistol and I was like boomer boomer on the ladder.

959
01:02:16,756 --> 01:02:17,440
Speaker 0: get away get away.

960
01:02:17,763 --> 01:02:19,419
Speaker 0: Scott Johnson runs right at it.

961
01:02:19,661 --> 01:02:23,679
Speaker 0: The boomer comes up the ladder and explodes on him because he shot it when he was standing right next to it.

962
01:02:25,484 --> 01:02:28,729
Speaker 0: It was it was beautiful He might be able to.

963
01:02:28,749 --> 01:02:29,814
Speaker 1: it was literally.

964
01:02:29,854 --> 01:02:32,561
Speaker 1: it was like he joins Medpack.

965
01:02:32,581 --> 01:02:34,085
Speaker 1: boomer vote to kick.

966
01:02:34,306 --> 01:02:34,948
Speaker 1: vote passes.

967
01:02:35,369 --> 01:02:36,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's one thing.

968
01:02:36,512 --> 01:02:39,040
Speaker 0: It does have a good, you know, there's a good voting system.

969
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,240
Speaker 0: You can vote to kick players off your team and all that.

970
01:02:41,280 --> 01:02:57,720
Speaker 0: So if you have an afk you can just sort of stick around in the safe room vote them out you know and get the AI to come in which is better than an afk at least and stuff like that, but He might be able to make an excuse that you know, he was doing it on purpose or something like that, which is possible.

971
01:02:58,421 --> 01:03:02,395
Speaker 0: But if that is the case, that means he should be able.

972
01:03:02,455 --> 01:03:09,920
Speaker 0: if he was doing that on purpose then He needs to prove that he doesn't suck by playing well.

973
01:03:10,801 --> 01:03:20,304
Speaker 0: So if his in if in his attempt to play well he fails then he was obviously not doing poorly on purpose and That that's it.

974
01:03:20,385 --> 01:03:20,687
Speaker 0: That's it.

975
01:03:20,768 --> 01:03:20,869
Speaker 0: He.

976
01:03:21,110 --> 01:03:22,280
Speaker 0: so he has a chance.

977
01:03:22,461 --> 01:03:23,985
Speaker 1: Oh, so public service announcement.

978
01:03:24,346 --> 01:03:26,954
Speaker 1: Scott Johnson is the MD of left for dead.

979
01:03:27,014 --> 01:03:29,100
Speaker 0: do not play left for dead with Scott Johnson.

980
01:03:29,341 --> 01:03:30,366
Speaker 0: He will ruin you.

981
01:03:30,547 --> 01:03:31,571
Speaker 0: I mean think about this, right?

982
01:03:31,632 --> 01:03:32,476
Speaker 0: I played left for dead.

983
01:03:32,516 --> 01:03:38,240
Speaker 0: It was like me Sad Johnson and two other people, you know, and I don't know, you know, I forget who the other people were.

984
01:03:38,501 --> 01:03:43,180
Speaker 0: But we're doing basically the very first campaign on advanced.

985
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:45,512
Speaker 0: We're just dying all over the place.

986
01:03:45,593 --> 01:03:46,759
Speaker 0: dead dead dead dead dead, right?

987
01:03:48,001 --> 01:03:53,980
Speaker 0: The night or a night or two before that I was playing the same campaign with water is poison and Alex and someone else.

988
01:03:54,321 --> 01:03:55,546
Speaker 0: We got all the way to the end.

989
01:03:55,607 --> 01:03:58,920
Speaker 0: We couldn't beat the end, but we got all the way to the end, right?

990
01:04:00,061 --> 01:04:03,893
Speaker 0: Then me rim classic and someone else played the campaign.

991
01:04:03,993 --> 01:04:05,077
Speaker 0: We just got to the end of beat it.

992
01:04:05,799 --> 01:04:08,426
Speaker 1: Wait a minute I got an idea without dying Scott Johnson.

993
01:04:08,466 --> 01:04:11,013
Speaker 0: same campaign same difficulty Scott Johnson.

994
01:04:11,254 --> 01:04:12,758
Speaker 1: I have an idea.

995
01:04:12,778 --> 01:04:17,020
Speaker 1: All right An ultimatum perhaps an offer.

996
01:04:17,963 --> 01:04:20,553
Speaker 1: We will never make fun of you on the show.

997
01:04:20,573 --> 01:04:32,433
Speaker 1: in regards to left for dead again if you will assemble a team of four people of your choosing who are willing to play with you and Take Scott and I on with a team of our choosing.

998
01:04:32,453 --> 01:04:35,124
Speaker 0: Yeah Beat us at versus.

999
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:35,686
Speaker 0: Yes.

1000
01:04:35,727 --> 01:04:36,570
Speaker 0: It's not gonna happen.

1001
01:04:36,610 --> 01:04:36,931
Speaker 0: Yes.

1002
01:04:36,971 --> 01:04:37,774
Speaker 0: They got no chance.

1003
01:04:37,834 --> 01:04:38,256
Speaker 0: Come on.

1004
01:04:38,276 --> 01:04:42,111
Speaker 1: You can train you Give you do it sometime in like January or February.

1005
01:04:42,131 --> 01:04:42,633
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

1006
01:04:42,834 --> 01:04:43,576
Speaker 0: I'll take classic.

1007
01:04:43,617 --> 01:04:44,480
Speaker 0: I'll take water is poison.

1008
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:46,167
Speaker 1: We got a film a demo with this.

1009
01:04:46,227 --> 01:04:48,597
Speaker 1: This has got to be the drudge match of the century.

1010
01:04:48,677 --> 01:04:49,220
Speaker 0: We can't lose.

1011
01:04:50,621 --> 01:04:55,780
Speaker 1: There's no way and I know I am pre hoc trash talking as Scott will attend.

1012
01:04:57,123 --> 01:04:57,486
Speaker 0: You ready?

1013
01:04:57,627 --> 01:04:59,520
Speaker 0: I got the fucking dumpster of trash, right?

1014
01:04:59,623 --> 01:05:01,703
Speaker 1: Scott Scott get a test.

1015
01:05:01,743 --> 01:05:05,516
Speaker 1: that pre hoc trash talk is something I don't do frequently.

1016
01:05:05,536 --> 01:05:07,043
Speaker 1: It is not a thing I did.

1017
01:05:07,287 --> 01:05:08,199
Speaker 1: I will do the post-hoc.

1018
01:05:08,681 --> 01:05:17,060
Speaker 1: once I know I'm going to win or once I have won the trash talk will come out about how so how bad you are and How much better your mom was the night before?

1019
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:26,845
Speaker 1: But if I'm not sure I'm gonna win I often won't trash talk because then if I lose the trash talk is returned to me Threefold much like Wicca.

1020
01:05:26,865 --> 01:05:36,160
Speaker 0: Yep, any trash talk you dispense that was not validated by victory is You know multiplied and you know, rich reverse direction.

1021
01:05:36,422 --> 01:05:39,200
Speaker 0: It's just like is why you should not dish it here.

1022
01:05:39,300 --> 01:05:48,820
Speaker 1: I until you are sure that the victory will come to back it up Of course, if you might if you think you're gonna lose and you trash talk anyway, and you pull it off.

1023
01:05:49,102 --> 01:05:51,320
Speaker 1: That's like the 10x multiplier in a pinball machine.

1024
01:05:51,521 --> 01:06:01,431
Speaker 0: That is because if you pre talk and then if you're pretty tall and you win Multiplied and sends forward you could have had some interesting rhyming.

1025
01:06:01,731 --> 01:06:07,388
Speaker 1: if you're pre talk and walk the walk They can't lame.

1026
