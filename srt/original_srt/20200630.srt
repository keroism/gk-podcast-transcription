1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,183
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday June 30th 2020.

2
00:00:11,183 --> 00:00:11,624
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,105 --> 00:00:14,151
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:18,966
Speaker 1: We were talking about the ends of games Scott.

5
00:00:19,370 --> 00:00:19,916
Speaker 1: do you hear it?

6
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,266
Speaker 0: The wrong ends.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:25,859
Speaker 0: let's do this.

8
00:00:26,823 --> 00:00:31,899
Speaker 1: So there is a lot of gaming news and there's even some breaking gaming news.

9
00:00:32,662 --> 00:00:34,689
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of broken gaming news.

10
00:00:34,729 --> 00:00:35,312
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

11
00:00:35,452 --> 00:00:37,660
Speaker 1: We'll start with breaking then we'll go into broken.

12
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:40,453
Speaker 1: I think let's start breaking because a while ago.

13
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,122
Speaker 1: I don't think we even did a show on it Did we?

14
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:42,848
Speaker 1: I don't even remember.

15
00:00:42,868 --> 00:00:44,239
Speaker 1: there was a thousand years ago.

16
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,340
Speaker 1: But that Amazon eSport game finally came out in like a beta form, right?

17
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:52,057
Speaker 0: So all right, so the long the long story quickly, right?

18
00:00:52,097 --> 00:00:55,531
Speaker 0: So There was Amazon's was making games.

19
00:00:55,571 --> 00:00:57,520
Speaker 0: They were making a game called breakaway.

20
00:00:57,601 --> 00:01:00,300
Speaker 0: That was supposed to be an eSport first and foremost.

21
00:01:00,501 --> 00:01:06,727
Speaker 0: It was sort of like an isometric view real-time action game where there was a ball and you would try to get it in But also fight.

22
00:01:07,149 --> 00:01:08,860
Speaker 0: I was trying to get into that game.

23
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,613
Speaker 0: I don't think I managed to play it for even a few seconds died.

24
00:01:12,974 --> 00:01:14,700
Speaker 0: I once met a person who worked on it.

25
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,420
Speaker 0: They told me it was a garbage fire that they didn't give me too many details.

26
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,946
Speaker 0: I wasn't able to talk to them again.

27
00:01:19,966 --> 00:01:22,114
Speaker 1: remember that conversation because I was standing.

28
00:01:22,214 --> 00:01:23,840
Speaker 0: it was at magfest, right?

29
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:34,559
Speaker 0: A friend of our a friend of ours also worked on stuff adjacent to it at Amazon at one point.

30
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:39,495
Speaker 0: But anyway Amazon is now making another game which we did a whole episode on right?

31
00:01:39,535 --> 00:01:40,640
Speaker 0: Did we do we do an episode?

32
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:43,997
Speaker 1: I was saying I don't remember if we did an episode or not because time we.

33
00:01:44,017 --> 00:01:48,320
Speaker 0: so Anyway, Amazon was making another game as the game is called crucible.

34
00:01:48,802 --> 00:01:53,720
Speaker 0: It was sort of a MOBA sort of an FPS combo, but not fully really.

35
00:01:53,981 --> 00:01:57,239
Speaker 0: But anyway, it came out as like an open beta free kind of thing.

36
00:01:58,521 --> 00:02:02,296
Speaker 0: We played it for a day or two just to like, you know, we didn't.

37
00:02:02,336 --> 00:02:03,099
Speaker 1: doesn't look like understand.

38
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:07,333
Speaker 1: So that tells you everything you need to know about our opinion of this game.

39
00:02:07,433 --> 00:02:09,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, we played it for a day or two.

40
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,792
Speaker 0: The it was just there wasn't anything about it.

41
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:14,575
Speaker 0: That was like man.

42
00:02:14,615 --> 00:02:16,080
Speaker 0: that specific thing is garbage.

43
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:20,862
Speaker 0: There was also absolutely nothing good about it where I could say wow, that's really fun It was just.

44
00:02:21,143 --> 00:02:33,004
Speaker 1: it was like eating a really mediocre grilled cheese sandwich like one made with like not just American cheese But because that can have its time and place but like Wonder Bread and the bottom tier of American cheese Like it's edible.

45
00:02:33,345 --> 00:02:34,068
Speaker 1: It's serviceable.

46
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:40,185
Speaker 0: No, because that what I would go you because it's Wonder Bread It's like wasn't?

47
00:02:40,265 --> 00:02:43,056
Speaker 0: imagine eating a food that is not you.

48
00:02:43,076 --> 00:02:45,749
Speaker 0: you don't say ew But you get absolutely no enjoyment from.

49
00:02:45,769 --> 00:02:47,720
Speaker 0: you know what it is and also no nourishment.

50
00:02:47,941 --> 00:02:49,828
Speaker 1: It is the road trip.

51
00:02:49,929 --> 00:02:52,880
Speaker 1: We took to Rochester where we ate at that big boy at the rest.

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,587
Speaker 0: Okay, that was you it wasn't you.

53
00:02:54,687 --> 00:02:56,996
Speaker 1: it was the most unsatisfying meal I've ever had in my life.

54
00:02:57,056 --> 00:02:57,357
Speaker 1: It was not.

55
00:02:59,706 --> 00:03:03,380
Speaker 1: My stomach was full but to quote Chrono Trigger I was still hungry.

56
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,702
Speaker 0: Anyway, it's a nothing game you.

57
00:03:06,762 --> 00:03:17,583
Speaker 0: all you do in this game is walk around aim your crosshairs on things and hold your mouse button down and watch their health bar decreased to zero or die first unless there are Groups of people.

58
00:03:17,643 --> 00:03:27,136
Speaker 1: and then the game is who spots who first but not like in a counter-strike valor and like exciting way but in a Oddly boring and unexciting way like city.

59
00:03:27,196 --> 00:03:29,065
Speaker 0: when the game came out It was free-to-play.

60
00:03:29,146 --> 00:03:31,680
Speaker 0: it got a lot of hype and press so a lot of people played it.

61
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,595
Speaker 0: Of course, they had thousands of concurrent players.

62
00:03:34,615 --> 00:03:35,459
Speaker 0: It was a big deal.

63
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:40,919
Speaker 1: I have like 12 hours into it all told I kept playing it to try to figure out what I didn't like about it.

64
00:03:41,561 --> 00:03:47,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, the point is that now they have like a hundred concurrent players.

65
00:03:47,461 --> 00:03:52,480
Speaker 0: So they're they're shutting it down unlike breakaway, which they just shut down completely.

66
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:59,895
Speaker 0: They may shut this down completely It may happen But for now what they're doing is they're closing it off to new players and they're just.

67
00:03:59,975 --> 00:04:03,809
Speaker 0: it's now closed beta Until they're gonna learn.

68
00:04:03,829 --> 00:04:08,999
Speaker 0: they said they're gonna listen to player input Which makes me thinks it might be a tribes to situation and not the good part.

69
00:04:10,261 --> 00:04:15,679
Speaker 0: But I guess if you're already a bad game, you can't really ruin it with player input the way tribes to did.

70
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:21,040
Speaker 0: true But I guess counter-strike didn't listen to player input and it only got more popular.

71
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:25,057
Speaker 0: Here's the point is they're gonna heavily rework the game because no one's playing.

72
00:04:25,157 --> 00:04:25,740
Speaker 1: but here's the trouble.

73
00:04:26,082 --> 00:04:27,594
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what their business model is.

74
00:04:27,876 --> 00:04:28,440
Speaker 0: No one's playing.

75
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,884
Speaker 1: It's the reason we didn't review.

76
00:04:29,964 --> 00:04:35,520
Speaker 1: it was specifically that I didn't have any like one flaw to point out.

77
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:45,777
Speaker 1: Like Scott pointed out it was just a very like unsatisfying experience for a variety of reasons But like I couldn't come up with a half-hour worth of things to say about it, but it's video game.

78
00:04:45,817 --> 00:04:52,445
Speaker 1: the video game Okay, but like it was just a worse risk of rain with this like Unfun.

79
00:04:52,525 --> 00:04:54,011
Speaker 0: well risk of rain one is good.

80
00:04:54,071 --> 00:05:09,827
Speaker 1: risk of rain - is more like this Yeah but imagine risk of rain - where there's other people just sharing the map with you and One of the two teams just gets wiped randomly based on who hit like secondary attack Earlier when the two groups met.

81
00:05:09,987 --> 00:05:11,492
Speaker 1: like that's the kind of game it was.

82
00:05:11,553 --> 00:05:26,164
Speaker 1: but what I also noticed was that Everyone I talked to who played it also had this like completely gray blank opinion of the game and I didn't see Anyone talking about it online like at all Press.

83
00:05:26,325 --> 00:05:36,746
Speaker 1: the press talked about it because it's Amazon had a lot of money behind it had a lot of push But like no human being I know who plays games who is not a journalist paid to play games said One word about this game.

84
00:05:37,108 --> 00:05:39,938
Speaker 1: even people I know who I saw were playing it.

85
00:05:41,501 --> 00:05:46,800
Speaker 0: All right, well crucible don't bother with it you haven't already and if you have already don't bother continuing.

86
00:05:47,023 --> 00:05:48,159
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I guess thank you.

87
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:52,879
Speaker 0: I don't think you need to be told that because no one's playing just the fact that we're so desperate to have shows.

88
00:05:53,462 --> 00:05:56,636
Speaker 1: We didn't even bother to review a game that I put 12 not desperate for.

89
00:05:56,676 --> 00:05:58,342
Speaker 0: Tuesday shows True.

90
00:05:58,863 --> 00:06:01,992
Speaker 1: So that's now let's talk about broken in games.

91
00:06:02,032 --> 00:06:16,566
Speaker 1: We don't even we're not gonna go through an exhaustive list here, but Tabletop in particular in the gaming world has had a lot of issues with harassment and racism as I'm sure you all know and Those issues

92
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:17,149
Speaker 0: are really

93
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:19,499
Speaker 1: getting worse a lot faster than they're getting better right now.

94
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:22,960
Speaker 0: Oh, well, I think it's you know, it's a little snowball effect, right?

95
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,615
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, some people get canceled here and there.

96
00:06:25,917 --> 00:06:36,260
Speaker 0: right, you know A few people are brave and they they call out, you know Who's guilty or accused of harassment or racism or sexism or discriminatory?

97
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:48,820
Speaker 0: practices or abuse of some kind etc, etc, and You know It used to be that people would largely not speak up because doing so would bring great consequences on to you the speaker.

98
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:54,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, the victim would just suffer more if they as they you know, try to get seek justice.

99
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:58,993
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also, you know, it's like okay Well, I'm willing to suffer more as long as I get the justice.

100
00:06:59,254 --> 00:07:00,319
Speaker 0: you wouldn't get the justice.

101
00:07:00,601 --> 00:07:14,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was it was a bad deal But what's happening lately is we're seeing a a lot of support for victims right more So than before even though it is still a very, you know hazardous path to take right?

102
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:23,538
Speaker 0: So I do not blame anyone who does not you know is not brave enough or you know willing to take you know call out their abusers or whatever.

103
00:07:23,558 --> 00:07:32,886
Speaker 0: and Likewise we're starting to see some justice not the full justice that is necessary not even close But some justice.

104
00:07:33,067 --> 00:07:34,192
Speaker 0: we're seeing people get fired.

105
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:35,840
Speaker 0: We're seeing people resign.

106
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:46,644
Speaker 0: We're seeing you know We're not seeing this kind of justice at the government level or at the big big big big places But we're seeing the medium and the small places, you know And it's pretty much happening.

107
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:55,300
Speaker 0: every single nerdery that I see across every single area of nerdism That I see I see some at least small justice happening.

108
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,360
Speaker 0: I

109
00:07:55,380 --> 00:08:27,280
Speaker 1: guess that the real change I'm seeing just now like in the last two and a half weeks in tabletop gaming is the shift from most companies say nothing and or only address specific complaints raised at them very narrowly to a to a very different operating model where almost every company is issuing statements and trying to get ahead of this stuff and taking some actions and Companies that are refusing to say anything are very much standing out for choosing to say nothing during this time.

110
00:08:28,002 --> 00:08:38,938
Speaker 0: All right, so a we're you know, because you know victims see other people getting some justice They're more willing to come out and then that causes other victims to be more willing to come out and so on and so on.

111
00:08:39,421 --> 00:08:42,364
Speaker 0: So we're finding out who the secret or not So secret shitheads are.

112
00:08:42,384 --> 00:08:54,259
Speaker 0: if you knew or didn't know certain game companies have not issued any statements about anything And that's very you know, and even companies that are making Vacuous statements and not taking any action, right?

113
00:08:55,781 --> 00:09:02,063
Speaker 0: You know, that's still better than not saying anything because obviously the company that's not saying anything is is yep It's like.

114
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,320
Speaker 0: it doesn't cost you to suck to anything to those vacuous statements.

115
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:17,647
Speaker 1: So the reason why I see those as a positive step is that while they are vacuous and they are not even like a billionth Of the way toward what we need they show something that is best illustrated by the advice the last fire marshal I worked with gave me.

116
00:09:18,171 --> 00:09:26,319
Speaker 1: he said very specifically I don't actually care if the rooms are overcrowded as you know Just in the course of like you running your event.

117
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:38,999
Speaker 1: What he said is I walk very slowly down the hallway and I just want to make sure that if you see me coming You can hide problems from me until I pass because that proves that you at least give a little bit of a shit.

118
00:09:40,482 --> 00:09:44,999
Speaker 1: If you can't even fake it then you are beyond saving and I'm gonna shut you down.

119
00:09:45,663 --> 00:09:51,372
Speaker 1: So a company that can't even fake it is Way worse than a company that I think it's.

120
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:59,600
Speaker 1: I think it's simply it sees The profit motive is on the right side of history Not the wrong side and is trying to be on the right side to avoid consequences.

121
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,193
Speaker 1: That's not the best motivation, but it's better than nothing.

122
00:10:02,615 --> 00:10:03,540
Speaker 0: I think it's more than that.

123
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:07,094
Speaker 0: It's like saying black lives matter cost you nothing truly gets the.

124
00:10:07,274 --> 00:10:08,740
Speaker 0: it's it like you can just say it all day.

125
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:11,634
Speaker 0: It's like okay that it's just so easy, right?

126
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:12,760
Speaker 0: I get to say three words.

127
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,779
Speaker 1: I mean it costs you shitheads on Twitter screaming at you, but you shouldn't be trying to make money from those people in her church.

128
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,006
Speaker 0: I mean, it's literally just say three words.

129
00:10:21,086 --> 00:10:23,052
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, that doesn't accomplish.

130
00:10:23,173 --> 00:10:24,577
Speaker 0: that doesn't accomplish anything.

131
00:10:24,637 --> 00:10:25,600
Speaker 0: right to say the three words.

132
00:10:26,622 --> 00:10:39,980
Speaker 0: The point is is that if someone is refusing to do that That is so easy right to make a statement that they might not even believe in to just lie And just say three words if they're refusing to put forth that minimal effort, right?

133
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:43,433
Speaker 0: Like maybe they are racist but and they refuse to say the three.

134
00:10:43,674 --> 00:10:43,955
Speaker 0: it's like.

135
00:10:44,156 --> 00:10:50,000
Speaker 0: that must mean If you're refusing to say those three words, okay, it must mean that you're racist.

136
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:52,500
Speaker 0: So it's just like oh, well now we can see who's good and who's bad.

137
00:10:52,701 --> 00:11:02,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like and it doesn't just saying it doesn't mean you're automatically good, but it at least means aha They're not a stubbornly racist person.

138
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,819
Speaker 0: They might have to go but they don't have to go first.

139
00:11:07,681 --> 00:11:08,084
Speaker 0: It's like.

140
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:11,482
Speaker 0: it's like they you know, it's like okay We're gonna.

141
00:11:11,562 --> 00:11:17,080
Speaker 0: the justice is going down the line right and sort of sorting the queue right for the scales, right?

142
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,999
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, you might tip the scale but you weigh less than that guy, you know reminds me.

143
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,128
Speaker 1: It reminds me of a game.

144
00:11:23,148 --> 00:11:24,520
Speaker 1: We used to play in middle school.

145
00:11:24,862 --> 00:11:27,018
Speaker 1: I don't remember what we called it, but they'd make us play it.

146
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:29,580
Speaker 1: No, this was late elementary school because it was gym class.

147
00:11:29,841 --> 00:11:34,760
Speaker 1: They'd line up everyone on one side of the gym like in race classes and you had to run to the other side of the gym.

148
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:38,060
Speaker 1: Whoever got there last was eliminated and then you had to run to the other side of the gym.

149
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,405
Speaker 1: Whoever got there last was eliminated.

150
00:11:39,646 --> 00:11:41,533
Speaker 1: and you just keep going till there's only one kid left.

151
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,186
Speaker 0: Oh And that's two teams.

152
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:44,770
Speaker 1: Yeah.

153
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:47,943
Speaker 0: Oh Good games a good game.

154
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:49,587
Speaker 1: But in this case, it's.

155
00:11:49,848 --> 00:11:51,512
Speaker 0: but I guess people could sandbag it.

156
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,736
Speaker 1: Yeah true true.

157
00:11:52,756 --> 00:11:55,384
Speaker 1: I Mean, it's basically just a guy.

158
00:11:55,404 --> 00:12:00,828
Speaker 1: mean kids would say the problem is that is just a game with two teams Just to keep kids busy for an hour.

159
00:12:01,571 --> 00:12:03,680
Speaker 0: I mean, yes, but as other things going on.

160
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,763
Speaker 1: But the concept of all right everyone.

161
00:12:05,963 --> 00:12:08,066
Speaker 1: there is slightly less racism over there.

162
00:12:08,387 --> 00:12:11,626
Speaker 1: The last person who gets there gets called Mm-hmm.

163
00:12:12,152 --> 00:12:12,273
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

164
00:12:12,637 --> 00:12:17,614
Speaker 1: So Dungeons & Dragons is getting independent like the video game industry had a huge thing.

165
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,200
Speaker 1: We're not even gonna try to address that.

166
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:22,328
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay Yeah just I mean there's so many of these to address.

167
00:12:22,409 --> 00:12:23,573
Speaker 0: right cards against humanity.

168
00:12:23,633 --> 00:12:25,700
Speaker 0: company got blowed up got blowed up for like.

169
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:27,706
Speaker 1: Not just the stuff you it's deservingly.

170
00:12:27,826 --> 00:12:32,160
Speaker 1: all of these are deserving fucked up stuff way beyond what anyone would have even dream.

171
00:12:32,441 --> 00:12:37,578
Speaker 0: These are all deserving blobs, by the way, even frickin Bon Appetit, you know magazine getting blowed up.

172
00:12:37,618 --> 00:12:44,837
Speaker 1: Yeah Dungeons & Dragons getting blowed dragons getting attacked from like five a hundred percent justified angles.

173
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:48,274
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Who else who else is taking heat right now?

174
00:12:48,355 --> 00:12:49,180
Speaker 0: I can't even keep track.

175
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:49,843
Speaker 0: There's so many.

176
00:12:49,883 --> 00:13:01,689
Speaker 1: the only thing that gave me that made me a little bit happy was that as the names of specific Abusers just were paraded around Twitter None of them are people I know respect or work with So far.

177
00:13:01,709 --> 00:13:05,609
Speaker 1: oh Sorry careful to check that list.

178
00:13:06,271 --> 00:13:10,551
Speaker 0: some tabletop war game companies are Good and some are not.

179
00:13:10,914 --> 00:13:17,080
Speaker 0: Yep I mean, you know, it's like there's a stereotype that the kind of people who play those games are old bearded white guys.

180
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,718
Speaker 0: Who you know our old bearded white guys?

181
00:13:20,842 --> 00:13:25,931
Speaker 0: Not I'd say that every old bearded white guy is Cuz I I will one day be one.

182
00:13:26,011 --> 00:13:28,200
Speaker 1: but we're not gonna go deep into this thread right now.

183
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:40,320
Speaker 1: This is like a topic you do a whole show on but basically in that world war games are interesting because Depending on where you look at that discourse you see very different people having very different conversations.

184
00:13:41,124 --> 00:13:48,358
Speaker 0: The point is whatever game companies you are Patronizing right you are gonna want to take a look at.

185
00:13:48,499 --> 00:13:53,518
Speaker 0: you know The Twitter's do a little searching and figure out if they're on the shit list or not.

186
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:57,662
Speaker 0: Yeah Because the shit list is evolving Rapidly.

187
00:13:57,783 --> 00:13:59,672
Speaker 0: I just say growing rapidly not evolving.

188
00:13:59,712 --> 00:14:00,637
Speaker 0: I don't see anyone coming off.

189
00:14:00,858 --> 00:14:04,167
Speaker 1: Yep No, like oh it turns out that wasn't true.

190
00:14:04,769 --> 00:14:07,917
Speaker 0: pretty much all true because I think I've never seen one of the hoods.

191
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:15,917
Speaker 1: So, yeah, so in some other news there's a game that's now there's a date for it.

192
00:14:15,997 --> 00:14:18,065
Speaker 1: the date is July 7th Which is real soon.

193
00:14:18,507 --> 00:14:27,500
Speaker 1: It's called super liminal and it's basically this like Hyper non-euclidean puzzle game and I didn't realize it was gonna come out on the switch.

194
00:14:28,561 --> 00:14:30,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, well just it's gonna come on PC too, right?

195
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,316
Speaker 0: Yeah, but so it's a FPS.

196
00:14:32,336 --> 00:14:33,160
Speaker 0: Why would I buy it on switch?

197
00:14:33,721 --> 00:14:35,879
Speaker 1: Uh, I mean, I don't know actually don't know if it'll come out on PC.

198
00:14:36,061 --> 00:14:43,740
Speaker 1: I originally thought it was gonna piece be a PC exclusive But it's listed on Nintendo's site and that's the only thing that's linking to it right now.

199
00:14:44,162 --> 00:14:46,636
Speaker 0: Are you sure this isn't some game that's already on PC.

200
00:14:46,716 --> 00:14:49,767
Speaker 1: I haven't checked Because it's been a thousand.

201
00:14:49,827 --> 00:14:52,560
Speaker 0: it's on the epic game store by now - I have a game store.

202
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,543
Speaker 1: That's why I don't have it.

203
00:14:54,085 --> 00:14:54,968
Speaker 0: It's on Steam.

204
00:14:55,389 --> 00:14:56,252
Speaker 0: add to your wish list.

205
00:14:56,292 --> 00:14:56,532
Speaker 0: plan.

206
00:14:56,553 --> 00:14:57,696
Speaker 0: release date, November 2020 November.

207
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:05,560
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's gonna come out on the switch July 7th, and it's gonna come out on the PC on Steam in like November.

208
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:10,000
Speaker 0: Well, it's gonna come out on Steam in November, but it seems to already be on the epic games.

209
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,673
Speaker 1: Yeah, right on the epic game store.

210
00:15:12,217 --> 00:15:17,654
Speaker 1: No But The game looks like it'll work on switch because it's basically this game like.

211
00:15:17,695 --> 00:15:20,873
Speaker 1: watch the video and you'll see It has a little bit of like vague.

212
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,040
Speaker 0: Oh, it's also gonna be on PS.

213
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:28,280
Speaker 0: So out now it says on the web the developer publisher what I don't know is pillow castle games.

214
00:15:28,801 --> 00:15:32,352
Speaker 0: So it says on their website out now epic game store coming soon.

215
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:33,396
Speaker 0: switch ps4.

216
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:34,740
Speaker 0: Xbox later steam.

217
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:35,482
Speaker 0: I'll wait for steam.

218
00:15:35,984 --> 00:15:43,451
Speaker 1: if I play all I might just get it on switch because the game I feel like the switch form factor and like looking around might be good because the game I don't like to play.

219
00:15:43,491 --> 00:15:51,480
Speaker 1: with FPS with two choices it feels like it has a Little bit of that like the game you linked me to an to chamber like here's a non euclidean place to help us there.

220
00:15:51,641 --> 00:16:01,638
Speaker 0: There are quite a few games of the FPS puzzle platformer genre Where things are like crazy and don't make sense because that's the kind of world you can make in a video game like

221
00:16:01,658 --> 00:16:06,433
Speaker 1: the Stanley Parable You make nine right turns and you are not like you are in a place.

222
00:16:06,474 --> 00:16:08,059
Speaker 1: You should not physically be able to be.

223
00:16:08,701 --> 00:16:14,926
Speaker 0: Well, I mean portal sort of was the one that sort of that started that whole, you know FPS puzzle platform thing.

224
00:16:14,946 --> 00:16:19,260
Speaker 1: I saw a lot of indie games in the indie mega right that did this in the past.

225
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,310
Speaker 0: Yes, but they're always saying is that experience is very tiny right?

226
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:30,740
Speaker 0: is that after portal there was an explosion of sort of indie games Taking that FPS puzzle platform model and just pushing it way further?

227
00:16:31,143 --> 00:16:37,201
Speaker 0: But they pushed it into a place that you know I don't think is very accessible to most people because it's like it messes with you Like.

228
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:43,039
Speaker 0: yeah, I think I think anything harder than portal is just gonna be like a lot of people are just gonna be like bar for something.

229
00:16:44,001 --> 00:16:44,864
Speaker 0: It's like what is going on?

230
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:46,530
Speaker 1: I try to VR experience.

231
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:52,831
Speaker 1: That was here is a non-euclidean space and it made me Extremely disoriented in a weird way.

232
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:54,520
Speaker 1: really quick, right?

233
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,292
Speaker 0: But yeah super liminal is one of those and it seems to be a very.

234
00:16:57,332 --> 00:17:01,311
Speaker 0: it might be the second most polished one I've ever seen because it looks like graphic wise.

235
00:17:01,371 --> 00:17:03,180
Speaker 1: it looks about as good as the Stanley Parable.

236
00:17:03,241 --> 00:17:13,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of the ones that I've seen are very You know indie and the mechanics are things like you see the person like pick up an object and then like hold it So it's close to their eyes and then let go of it.

237
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,740
Speaker 1: And now it's massive because they change the perspective like it's that kind of nonsense.

238
00:17:18,202 --> 00:17:27,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like it's sort of like reach up and pick the moon out of the sky kind of situation where you know The objects, you know the true size of the object, you know looks further or closer.

239
00:17:29,102 --> 00:17:31,640
Speaker 0: You know because that's how we perceive the sizes.

240
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:37,598
Speaker 0: You know the distance of things is based on their size Right and also based on logic and the game sort of just.

241
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:41,157
Speaker 0: you know You can tell the trailer of the game that that it turns that on its head right.

242
00:17:41,237 --> 00:17:44,574
Speaker 0: a small object that you think is far away is actually a close object.

243
00:17:44,594 --> 00:17:50,273
Speaker 0: a Object that you think is small and close is actually far away and large.

244
00:17:50,514 --> 00:17:55,940
Speaker 1: and the reason I'm like talking about this even though I Have not played it is that I've seen a lot of trailers for games like this before.

245
00:17:56,282 --> 00:18:02,813
Speaker 1: This is the first one where I watched the trailer and I thought wow I get it and that looks really fun kind of like Baba is you.

246
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:06,430
Speaker 1: I saw a little bit of gameplay and I was like Oh, ah that that's a game for me.

247
00:18:06,973 --> 00:18:12,700
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the only negative thing I think I can say about it is it seems a little escape roomy, but I mean portals escape roomy.

248
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,899
Speaker 0: So portal is basically just a portal is literally escape room.

249
00:18:16,861 --> 00:18:22,578
Speaker 0: It's every ever only every room has the same key And you got I'll have the key from the start.

250
00:18:23,741 --> 00:18:29,300
Speaker 1: In some other minor news, there's a game we talked about a long long long long time ago called natural selection.

251
00:18:29,626 --> 00:18:30,258
Speaker 1: I love that game.

252
00:18:30,824 --> 00:18:32,518
Speaker 0: I mean it was it started as a half-life 1 mod.

253
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:46,209
Speaker 0: That was you know I was an RTS plus FPS a dream that no one has not come true in any other game since right where one person is The commander building the base and everyone else is the soldiers and it was also an asymmetric Marines vs.

254
00:18:46,311 --> 00:18:46,939
Speaker 0: Aliens game.

255
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:48,948
Speaker 0: So it's basically natural selection.

256
00:18:49,008 --> 00:18:58,898
Speaker 0: since we played the half-life 1 mod when it came out in the early 2000s It was like a dream game, you know doing things that no other game has done before or since.

257
00:18:59,019 --> 00:18:59,239
Speaker 0: yep.

258
00:18:59,621 --> 00:19:06,806
Speaker 0: So and it sort of died and I made NS to came in and is to the company that made NS2 Went on to make other games.

259
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:10,780
Speaker 1: They made what the sea game unknown worlds entertainment is the publisher and the developer.

260
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:13,164
Speaker 1: What on the water?

261
00:19:13,184 --> 00:19:15,150
Speaker 1: yes engine specifically for NS2.

262
00:19:15,471 --> 00:19:18,540
Speaker 1: and then they said oh we should make other games to make money to fund NS2.

263
00:19:20,215 --> 00:19:25,012
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, yeah, let me see what their current repertoire is.

264
00:19:25,072 --> 00:19:26,738
Speaker 0: subnautica that's the other game they made.

265
00:19:26,859 --> 00:19:34,890
Speaker 0: let's see Nautica is the main one, but they're working on something else now that has not been announced because they were doing job postings They saw on Twitter.

266
00:19:35,798 --> 00:19:37,343
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, they made under.

267
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:46,240
Speaker 0: they made natural selection - then they made subnautica and natural selection - has now sort of Community run kind of thing, right?

268
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:51,583
Speaker 0: There's like an arrangement where there's people keeping it alive and I had a very recent update June 26 Like it's.

269
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:53,778
Speaker 0: they're still working on it the Metro update.

270
00:19:54,614 --> 00:20:01,639
Speaker 0: So yeah This game is alive and it is better than it was the last time I played it many and it's on Super sale because of the steam summer sale.

272
00:20:08,064 --> 00:20:09,628

273
00:20:09,789 --> 00:20:11,835
Speaker 0: It's a FPS and RTS.

274
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:15,462
Speaker 0: one person's commanding everyone is Soldiers.

275
00:20:16,385 --> 00:20:17,589
Speaker 0: it's like the game you wanted.

276
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:20,659
Speaker 0: it's been around for like 20 years, but it's the only game that's done it.

277
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,386
Speaker 0: Yep, and people are.

278
00:20:22,426 --> 00:20:25,799
Speaker 0: not only some people are playing it but not nearly as many people as should be.

279
00:20:25,819 --> 00:20:26,625
Speaker 1: now You might ask room.

280
00:20:26,645 --> 00:20:27,008
Speaker 1: It's gone.

281
00:20:27,048 --> 00:20:28,580
Speaker 1: Why weren't you playing it all this time?

282
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:32,297
Speaker 1: And when it first came out while I did play a lot I did.

283
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:37,958
Speaker 1: I did too But it was still kind of buggy and it had performance issues back then and I think it's just.

284
00:20:38,379 --> 00:20:44,952
Speaker 0: you know I just sort of fell out of it after playing it a whole bunch and also the skill cap was pretty high And my skills are pretty low.

285
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:51,643
Speaker 0: So You know, yeah, and also I played it at a time where it's development on it Slowed down.

286
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:52,486
Speaker 0: is the unknown worlds?

287
00:20:52,506 --> 00:21:02,356
Speaker 0: people went to go work on subnautica, right and that community support That's been keeping it fresh came much many years later And I didn't get back into it since then because I was doing other things.

288
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:05,732
Speaker 1: I was playing like netrunner Yeah, but I've reinstalled it and started playing it again.

289
00:21:05,752 --> 00:21:07,500
Speaker 1: All those performance issues are gone.

290
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:13,180
Speaker 1: I can't say if it's because my video card is probably like four orders of magnitude more powerful than the one I had.

291
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,963
Speaker 1: Who does?

292
00:21:15,546 --> 00:21:18,356
Speaker 0: I'd note netrunner was very popular at unknown worlds HQ.

293
00:21:19,139 --> 00:21:22,892
Speaker 1: Ah So yeah, I'm gonna be playing some natural selection off and on.

294
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:25,422
Speaker 1: if you want to play to see we get some games together Maybe I'll live.

295
00:21:25,442 --> 00:21:27,709
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe I installed it again.

296
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:30,980
Speaker 1: Maybe I was terrible at ns2, but we'll gladly play.

297
00:21:31,562 --> 00:21:32,849
Speaker 0: I'm better at marine than alien.

298
00:21:33,210 --> 00:21:38,378
Speaker 1: I am actually better at alien than marine But I don't know if that is still true.

299
00:21:39,501 --> 00:21:47,260
Speaker 0: I'm bad at all the roles like lurk and fade where you have to be fast Oh fades I can't fade and I'm bad with the and I'm bad with the jetpack, right?

300
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:52,255
Speaker 1: But anything and it's like me wasting my my resources to fade means we instantly lose.

301
00:21:52,676 --> 00:21:53,559
Speaker 0: Yeah, the slower ones.

302
00:21:53,599 --> 00:21:53,980
Speaker 0: I'm better.

303
00:21:54,061 --> 00:21:54,837
Speaker 0: I'm good with onos.

304
00:21:55,883 --> 00:21:57,536
Speaker 1: Great at onos and as one I was.

305
00:21:57,777 --> 00:22:04,745
Speaker 1: the thing I was the best at was actually being either being the one guy with a grenade launcher or Being the lurk.

306
00:22:04,886 --> 00:22:06,133
Speaker 1: I was so good at the lurk in ns1.

307
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:09,744
Speaker 0: I saw It's like ns2.

308
00:22:09,844 --> 00:22:20,274
Speaker 0: right natural or one or two right capturing those resource nodes right like mattered a lot Yeah, and you look at like go back to crucible right capturing those resource.

309
00:22:20,374 --> 00:22:21,217
Speaker 0: No shit.

310
00:22:21,297 --> 00:22:23,143
Speaker 0: It didn't really matter Right.

311
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:31,219
Speaker 0: I think what it is is all these games these FPS is where they want the players to capture nodes Right and you like you just get these sort of points.

312
00:22:31,742 --> 00:22:32,726
Speaker 0: It's like ns2.

313
00:22:32,766 --> 00:22:36,280
Speaker 0: those points are literal currency you spend like a board game, right?

314
00:22:36,641 --> 00:22:48,109
Speaker 1: and I think that gives the and the economy is real tight like ns1 even I remember like we'd be playing and like The commander be like, oh shit They're taking down the RT in the cafeteria.

315
00:22:48,190 --> 00:22:50,540
Speaker 1: fucking get your asses over there right now.

316
00:22:50,721 --> 00:22:52,470
Speaker 1: Or I'm gonna we're gonna I'm gonna quit and we lose.

317
00:22:53,174 --> 00:22:53,415
Speaker 0: right.

318
00:22:53,455 --> 00:22:59,917
Speaker 0: and I think that Making those resource points into a currency as opposed to like leveling up players, right?

319
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:15,818
Speaker 0: Yeah is What makes capturing resource nodes is like an ns2 like a great fun thing and Doing it in other games is always me also just the fun of like having someone who's playing a commander playing an RTS Literally giving you orders and telling you what to do.

320
00:23:16,241 --> 00:23:20,360
Speaker 1: But it's up to you on how to execute those orders like if commander sucks you can ignore them.

321
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,699
Speaker 1: Like there's a lot of fun dynamics that just don't exist in most other games.

322
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:32,887
Speaker 1: but anyway things Of the day, what do you get?

323
00:23:32,907 --> 00:23:33,611
Speaker 1: Well, I know what you got.

324
00:23:33,651 --> 00:23:34,194
Speaker 1: It's really good.

325
00:23:34,274 --> 00:23:41,148
Speaker 0: So yeah, so Back in a long time ago Like in the 50s 60s, right?

326
00:23:41,470 --> 00:23:43,739
Speaker 0: There was a man named baba see baba.

327
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:45,305
Speaker 0: sigh I don't know how to pronounce his name.

328
00:23:45,365 --> 00:23:45,867
Speaker 0: I'm sorry.

329
00:23:46,288 --> 00:23:49,480
Speaker 0: It was a man from Senegal right in Dakar, right?

330
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,789
Speaker 0: You probably heard of Dakar.

331
00:23:50,849 --> 00:23:52,100
Speaker 0: so they have the Dakar rally.

332
00:23:52,902 --> 00:23:54,814
Speaker 0: It's basically on the left side of Africa.

333
00:23:54,875 --> 00:23:56,884
Speaker 0: on the top We're the big bubble part.

334
00:23:56,985 --> 00:24:01,621
Speaker 0: Dakar is like this little thing that sticks out of the desert like on the the very left side of Africa.

335
00:24:01,641 --> 00:24:05,995
Speaker 0: it sticks out of Senegal and that's like the main best city of Senegal.

336
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:06,777
Speaker 0: is Dakar right?

337
00:24:06,797 --> 00:24:07,680
Speaker 0: It's like we're all the good stuff.

338
00:24:09,342 --> 00:24:21,510
Speaker 0: So this man from Dakar he played a game a board game called drafts Which is basically a version of checkers or checkers is a version of drafts But like, you know, it's called international drafts.

339
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:23,196
Speaker 0: It's quite similar to checkers.

340
00:24:23,216 --> 00:24:24,380
Speaker 0: You can look up the rules online.

341
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:24,622
Speaker 0: There's.

342
00:24:24,702 --> 00:24:27,240
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into the variants of checkers and etymology.

343
00:24:27,842 --> 00:24:29,047
Speaker 0: We are not getting into that.

344
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:32,620
Speaker 0: if you can look at that up yourself you have internet because you're listening to this.

345
00:24:32,681 --> 00:24:33,520
Speaker 0: I know you have internet.

346
00:24:35,144 --> 00:24:36,759
Speaker 0: We're only available on the internet.

347
00:24:38,364 --> 00:24:51,644
Speaker 0: and in supposedly a French drafts player went to Dakar met Baba see right and played and Supposedly got destroyed at drafts And said oh shit.

348
00:24:51,664 --> 00:24:53,730
Speaker 0: You're way good at this and brought Baba sigh.

349
00:24:53,951 --> 00:24:54,733
Speaker 0: see I'm sorry.

350
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:55,355
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna.

351
00:24:55,416 --> 00:24:55,857
Speaker 0: I'll stick with.

352
00:24:55,917 --> 00:24:56,579
Speaker 0: see I don't know.

353
00:24:58,345 --> 00:25:01,645
Speaker 0: back to Europe right to play.

354
00:25:02,267 --> 00:25:09,764
Speaker 0: and in 1962 right Baba played against 150 players simultaneously.

355
00:25:09,804 --> 00:25:16,515
Speaker 0: this video of this it really happened videos a hundred and 150 drafts players lined up at their own boards, right.

356
00:25:16,535 --> 00:25:29,672
Speaker 0: so you could imagine like, you know 150 checkers players with a checkers board in front of them and Baba would walk around the room taking his turn one board at a time And then he would have to take 149 turns before he got back to your boards.

357
00:25:29,712 --> 00:25:31,360
Speaker 0: you had all that time to think about your turn.

358
00:25:31,734 --> 00:25:34,130
Speaker 0: Yeah And he would come and look at your turn.

359
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,898
Speaker 0: look at your board for like a second and take his turn.

360
00:25:35,918 --> 00:25:38,360
Speaker 1: like most of these Boards he doesn't even stop walking.

361
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, he just keeps walking.

362
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:48,075
Speaker 0: He's like turn turn turn turn turn and you sit there and think he takes 149 turns and then you take your turn and then he takes his turn and then he passes on.

363
00:25:48,476 --> 00:25:55,520
Speaker 0: and he some of the people Sitting in that room right not all of them, but some of them were like champions of this game, right?

364
00:25:55,961 --> 00:25:56,503
Speaker 0: So it'd be like you.

365
00:25:56,543 --> 00:26:02,946
Speaker 0: imagine me going around a chess tables, right and like, you know What's his name?

366
00:26:03,006 --> 00:26:05,900
Speaker 0: max is there right at one of the tables, you know?

367
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:06,384
Speaker 0: It's like.

368
00:26:06,465 --> 00:26:10,471
Speaker 0: I didn't know he was a champion or anything But he was just one of the people amongst all the others.

369
00:26:10,833 --> 00:26:14,396
Speaker 0: Anyway, Baba beat all of them every single one.

370
00:26:15,662 --> 00:26:18,334
Speaker 0: He went on to win the French championship, right.

371
00:26:18,897 --> 00:26:19,480
Speaker 0: the next year.

372
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:27,079
Speaker 0: There are apparently, you know, you know it was disputed but apparently they later on declared him the victor.

373
00:26:27,099 --> 00:26:35,399
Speaker 0: but anyway You know There's not a lot of champions in board gaming other than like chess and this guy is the true greatest of all time.

374
00:26:35,981 --> 00:26:38,689
Speaker 0: Right, if you're talking about like, you know board games, like.

375
00:26:38,990 --> 00:26:40,935
Speaker 0: there's no famous monopoly champion.

376
00:26:40,955 --> 00:26:42,720
Speaker 0: There's no famous diplomacy champion.

377
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:45,898
Speaker 0: I mean there are champions of those games because they do have competitive scenes.

378
00:26:47,044 --> 00:26:50,400
Speaker 0: Even the Scrabble champions, which have a very organized competitive scene are not famous.

379
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:54,799
Speaker 0: Can anyone listening to this name a Scrabble world champion without looking it up, right?

380
00:26:55,380 --> 00:27:02,239
Speaker 0: I probably only named champions of chess and go I imagine right board game wise even though other games or magic magic you can name.

381
00:27:03,682 --> 00:27:04,853
Speaker 0: So here you go.

382
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:12,640
Speaker 0: My man My man Baba is probably one of the greatest, you know If he had been alive at a time when different board games were played, right?

383
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,840
Speaker 1: I can imagine this guy walking up and down the row of a bunch of games like tickets are afraid.

384
00:27:16,921 --> 00:27:18,196
Speaker 1: He's just be like boop boop boop.

385
00:27:19,343 --> 00:27:23,180
Speaker 0: Or if he or if he had played chess or go which did exist at the time, right?

386
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,639
Speaker 0: It's just he happened to play drafts.

387
00:27:25,102 --> 00:27:29,540
Speaker 0: But yeah, true board game champions are few and far between and hard to come by.

388
00:27:30,122 --> 00:27:33,557
Speaker 0: So, you know whenever you find out about one, right?

389
00:27:33,597 --> 00:27:35,744
Speaker 0: They should be Celebrated and revered.

390
00:27:35,784 --> 00:27:38,556
Speaker 0: I think we need like a board game a competitive board game Hall of Fame.

391
00:27:38,596 --> 00:27:42,339
Speaker 1: if one doesn't exist Why don't we make it declare that we're the ones who run it?

392
00:27:43,702 --> 00:27:46,033
Speaker 0: If it doesn't exist, we could no one stopping us.

393
00:27:46,455 --> 00:27:47,660
Speaker 0: That's how all those things start.

394
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:50,350
Speaker 0: It's just someone that twin galaxies just some people just starting it.

395
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:53,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, they declared themselves the authority, right?

396
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,823
Speaker 0: So we could do that.

397
00:27:55,084 --> 00:27:59,580
Speaker 1: and if we did boom all we have to is make a first-class inductee guaranteed.

398
00:27:59,881 --> 00:28:02,975
Speaker 1: We make a website we make a board that votes and that's it.

399
00:28:03,075 --> 00:28:04,180
Speaker 1: We just start inducting people.

400
00:28:04,981 --> 00:28:09,560
Speaker 0: Sure, let's say we need trophy and we need we need a building and we need to put plaques in the building.

401
00:28:09,882 --> 00:28:11,692
Speaker 1: We could start with a purely and you have to write.

402
00:28:11,712 --> 00:28:27,919
Speaker 0: you have to write those little museum context things next to each person right to tell their story and Then we need to collect like we need like a curator who can like, you know, get artifacts like, you know, uh His Baba sees traps draft table his drafts board his pieces, right?

403
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:33,015
Speaker 1: Anyway, so you're not familiar with a PX accessible player experiences.

404
00:28:33,076 --> 00:28:38,800
Speaker 1: This website is actually Really really in-depth like you should check this out even if you're not a game designer.

405
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:48,550
Speaker 1: But basically it is and a deep exploration of the most important design patterns for designing Accessible games video games tabletop games anything.

406
00:28:48,590 --> 00:28:51,500
Speaker 1: How do you make games accessible to different kinds of audiences?

407
00:28:52,321 --> 00:29:06,562
Speaker 1: and the best part about this site is that it gives practical examples and specific advice on very very nuanced things like Precision or flexible text entry or like having second channels of communication Like.

408
00:29:06,944 --> 00:29:10,240
Speaker 1: I don't want to even do this site at a service by explaining any of these in detail.

409
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:27,420
Speaker 1: you should just check this out, but it also addresses a lot of the Weird and often spurious arguments that a lot of game designers like to make against accessibility For usually stupid reasons, but it makes it very clear that these are design patterns that can expand the audience that can access a game.

410
00:29:27,701 --> 00:29:34,610
Speaker 1: I'm even gonna quote this website because it's very they just they say it so well Providing access to your games and adapting the challenge.

411
00:29:34,811 --> 00:29:37,400
Speaker 1: change and adapting the challenge changes your game.

412
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,232
Speaker 1: But we're not saying you should limit or water down the experience your game offers.

413
00:29:41,594 --> 00:29:47,883
Speaker 1: if you want your game to offer the edge of The sea tension of stalking a wild animal through the forest then that's the player experience You should be aiming for.

414
00:29:48,285 --> 00:29:54,780
Speaker 1: what a PX offers is a way to think about whether you could provide that Experience to players who have different types of disabilities.

415
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:59,477
Speaker 1: So like if you're saying oh my game requires you to hear like it's a sound thing.

416
00:29:59,879 --> 00:30:02,080
Speaker 1: fine Sure, you can make that choice.

417
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:17,713
Speaker 1: But are there other design patterns you can implement in your game to make it more accessible to all the other areas of disability all the other types of players or all the other places that aren't specifically depending upon the specific game vision you have?

418
00:30:18,134 --> 00:30:23,200
Speaker 1: this website is actually like Should be one of your first go-to resources.

419
00:30:23,321 --> 00:30:35,088
Speaker 0: What if you're designing a game and I feel like a lot of people, you know And this is true of just all products in general is that people who make products tend to think of if they do think of Accessibility at all, right?

420
00:30:35,268 --> 00:30:36,313
Speaker 0: Yeah, I often think of it.

421
00:30:36,393 --> 00:30:37,196
Speaker 0: last like okay.

422
00:30:37,216 --> 00:30:38,100
Speaker 0: We've made our website.

423
00:30:38,261 --> 00:30:39,754
Speaker 1: Let's get someone to try it out.

424
00:30:39,774 --> 00:30:45,760
Speaker 0: Let's right Let's get some accessibility consultants and edit the website to make it accessible and fix it up.

425
00:30:45,861 --> 00:30:48,860
Speaker 0: It's like no no, no, no, no, you got to do that shit from the start.

426
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:53,216
Speaker 0: Otherwise by the time the accessibility people show up to look at your finished product, right?

427
00:30:53,537 --> 00:30:54,280
Speaker 0: That's you're right.

428
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,457
Speaker 0: They're gonna be like, oh you got like overhaul all this shit.

429
00:30:56,478 --> 00:31:00,658
Speaker 0: You're like Yeah, all right, even if you mean well and you're gonna do it.

430
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,204
Speaker 0: So you should.

431
00:31:02,224 --> 00:31:20,616
Speaker 0: if you're going to be making games and you want them to be accessible You should be you know, reading the relevant things here In advance of starting on any UX type components, you know Like your your your game rules don't really have any accessibility from right?

432
00:31:20,656 --> 00:31:27,600
Speaker 0: They might I guess it's possible But usually that you can start just making game rules without you know, worrying about the accessibility too hard.

433
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:29,991
Speaker 0: It's mostly once you get into the interface of the game.

434
00:31:30,011 --> 00:31:32,100
Speaker 0: All right, how do our people interacting with the rules?

435
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:36,659
Speaker 0: Yep, as soon as you start with that like you're gonna make a game board, you know, it's like.

436
00:31:36,699 --> 00:31:37,946
Speaker 0: okay I've imagined this game.

437
00:31:38,168 --> 00:31:39,657
Speaker 0: Oh now I'm making a board for the game up.

438
00:31:40,080 --> 00:31:42,681
Speaker 0: now You got to think about accessibility because you're making an interface but like.

439
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,807
Speaker 1: here's an example how deep these go.

440
00:31:43,827 --> 00:32:02,309
Speaker 1: if you click on any one of these patterns it gives you a Really detailed explanation with like five or six examples from real games of implementations of those patterns to a depth that Like you can just crib from this website and probably design a good game Irrespective of accessibility that you're adding right?

441
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:05,280
Speaker 0: The point is there's no excuse you can't be like, oh, I didn't know.

442
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,690
Speaker 0: Well, here was a free website that told you jackass.

443
00:32:07,850 --> 00:32:11,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, the I didn't know excuse applies to like Advanced edge cases.

444
00:32:11,807 --> 00:32:15,201
Speaker 1: this stuff is should be like game design 101.

445
00:32:15,201 --> 00:32:24,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you and especially if you're making a game with any kind of budget, right you're zero excuse for not You know fully complying with pretty much everything on here.

446
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:24,701
Speaker 0: Yeah,

447
00:32:25,122 --> 00:32:35,079
Speaker 1: or at least if your game is weird and like require like you not every game can accommodate every one of these but you should at least have looked at every one of these and at least had the conversation of

448
00:32:35,842 --> 00:32:36,063
Speaker 0: Could

449
00:32:36,083 --> 00:32:37,468
Speaker 1: we apply this to our game or not?

450
00:32:37,548 --> 00:32:39,958
Speaker 1: Like does this work or not and apply as many as you can?

451
00:32:41,241 --> 00:32:41,443
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

452
00:32:42,451 --> 00:32:47,513
Speaker 1: All right in the meta moment It's been a thousand years since the last time we streamed geek nights.

453
00:32:47,573 --> 00:32:49,280
Speaker 1: It's been a month since the last time we did a show.

454
00:32:50,521 --> 00:32:55,260
Speaker 1: This feels like it's gonna be a really long year and the only conventions will be attending our online conventions.

455
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:57,363
Speaker 0: It's pretty much it.

456
00:32:57,423 --> 00:32:57,624
Speaker 0: Yep.

457
00:32:58,366 --> 00:33:10,704
Speaker 0: So there is a book club book, which is the tale of Genji the first novel in all of human History, yeah, and I haven't read one page of it since I have last been on the New York subway, which is probably February or March The illusion.

458
00:33:10,724 --> 00:33:11,969
Speaker 0: it's already July.

459
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:16,795
Speaker 1: tomorrow what I will and you're probably listening to this Well, both of us are very lucky and that we have jobs.

460
00:33:16,815 --> 00:33:17,499
Speaker 1: we can work from home.

461
00:33:17,923 --> 00:33:20,020
Speaker 1: But what that means is that on one hand?

462
00:33:20,100 --> 00:33:24,760
Speaker 1: I feel like I have all this free time because I don't have to commute and I can't go anywhere.

463
00:33:25,061 --> 00:33:29,380
Speaker 1: So I should be getting a lot more done in my free time and like me I am getting a lot more sleeping done.

464
00:33:29,561 --> 00:33:30,727
Speaker 1: I'm also getting a lot more sleeping.

465
00:33:30,747 --> 00:33:33,340
Speaker 1: But the reality is still working eight hours a day.

466
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,929
Speaker 1: I don't actually have more free time.

467
00:33:35,969 --> 00:33:38,960
Speaker 1: My commute was only like five to ten minutes anyway.

468
00:33:39,382 --> 00:33:41,353
Speaker 0: So on this whole geek nights thing takes a lot of time.

469
00:33:41,373 --> 00:33:42,500
Speaker 0: You should stop doing this.

470
00:33:44,802 --> 00:33:48,379
Speaker 1: Geek nights takes a lot more time to make remotely than it does in person.

471
00:33:48,781 --> 00:33:49,326
Speaker 1: That is not a lie.

472
00:33:51,321 --> 00:33:57,066
Speaker 1: And also there are things that we want to do that would be so hard to do not in person that that's why we're not Working on them.

473
00:33:57,086 --> 00:33:58,380
Speaker 1: There's things I want to work on with Scott.

474
00:33:58,942 --> 00:34:04,760
Speaker 1: We really just can't work on them unless we get together physically and set up some cameras and that's not gonna fly anytime soon.

475
00:34:05,023 --> 00:34:05,653
Speaker 1: So nope.

476
00:34:06,862 --> 00:34:16,010
Speaker 1: So, yeah, otherwise my best advice to you join our discord join our forum follow Scott and me on YouTube and we're gonna try to Increasingly do projects that we can make progress on.

477
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:22,362
Speaker 1: that do not require us to share Spit air with each other for the foreseeable future Mm-hmm.

478
00:34:23,286 --> 00:34:25,397
Speaker 1: So yeah this uh, we've done this before.

479
00:34:25,417 --> 00:34:28,127
Speaker 1: this is a Panel idea we're working on.

480
00:34:28,208 --> 00:34:29,795
Speaker 1: Scott's done a lot of work writing this one.

481
00:34:29,835 --> 00:34:30,458
Speaker 1: We kind of take turns.

482
00:34:30,478 --> 00:34:36,620
Speaker 0: Yes Alright, so I've been writing this panel for like, you know, I actually only spent maybe a couple days on it.

483
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,239
Speaker 0: But there were long gaps between those couple days.

484
00:34:40,301 --> 00:34:45,603
Speaker 0: But I wanted to make a panel because it's a topic that just kept coming up all the time About game endings.

485
00:34:46,025 --> 00:34:56,121
Speaker 0: and the problem is I can't think of a name for the panel because if we call it endings Yeah, they're like, oh you mean like the end of Final Fantasy 4. if you say the end of Megaman or you know It's like the.

486
00:34:56,161 --> 00:35:02,020
Speaker 0: you know gate video games that are single-player have like these endings You get to the end of the game and after you beat the square boss.

487
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:02,803
Speaker 0: There's like an ending.

488
00:35:02,943 --> 00:35:04,750
Speaker 1: if we call it something I'm talking about that.

489
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:12,200
Speaker 1: if we talk about call it like the end of games People might think we're talking about like future post-scarcity like weird nonsense.

490
00:35:12,602 --> 00:35:13,045
Speaker 1: I could see that.

491
00:35:13,165 --> 00:35:17,368
Speaker 0: but no I'm talking about ending conditions in Ortho games.

492
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:20,486
Speaker 0: right so, you know When does football end when the clock runs out?

493
00:35:20,827 --> 00:35:27,830
Speaker 0: when does a monopoly end when someone and everyone's bankrupt except one person, you know When does an 18xx game?

494
00:35:28,091 --> 00:35:29,738
Speaker 0: and well when add do you know the?

495
00:35:29,818 --> 00:35:34,253
Speaker 0: when the the bank runs out of money at the end of that operating round or whatever?

496
00:35:34,334 --> 00:35:38,912
Speaker 1: and we've talked about this as Part of a lot of our other lectures in the past like our ones on.

497
00:35:39,113 --> 00:35:42,428
Speaker 1: take your damn turn like how to make games go Faster in designing game rules.

498
00:35:42,469 --> 00:35:44,760
Speaker 1: We talked about this at length and how to win at games.

499
00:35:45,002 --> 00:35:47,040
Speaker 1: We talked a lot about ending conditions, right?

500
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:54,580
Speaker 0: It's something that comes up frequently as a portion of other panels and I was like, hey I can just do a whole panel and zoom in to just that one topic.

501
00:35:55,842 --> 00:35:59,360
Speaker 0: So since I 90% wrote the panel, I just didn't make slides for it.

502
00:35:59,742 --> 00:36:02,860
Speaker 0: I figured hey we can use this as a topic of a geek nights episode.

503
00:36:02,947 --> 00:36:09,920
Speaker 0: Yeah Right anyone who hears this episode won't have to watch the panel and then we can maybe get some ideas while we talk about it.

504
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:21,754
Speaker 0: Maybe that when we make a video to send to an online convention to show of this panel and we have slides It'll be better because we use this geek nights episode to improve upon it.

505
00:36:22,055 --> 00:36:35,000
Speaker 1: And since we haven't played any new games We get a free show ID and also we're losing, you know again because of kovat and the lack of conventions A lot of times we'll workshop a panel at a few cons before we get like the final version.

506
00:36:35,582 --> 00:36:36,728
Speaker 1: Can't really do that now.

507
00:36:37,089 --> 00:36:37,833
Speaker 0: So no.

508
00:36:38,456 --> 00:36:45,240
Speaker 0: All right, so The first thing we got to talk about when it comes to game endings is that every game has to have an ending.

509
00:36:45,501 --> 00:36:46,405
Speaker 1: Well, what would I say?

510
00:36:46,425 --> 00:36:48,354
Speaker 1: that other panel if it doesn't end?

511
00:36:48,515 --> 00:36:52,963
Speaker 0: It's not a game Right, well you said if you can't quit It's not a game.

512
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:55,352
Speaker 0: quitting is relevant to the game endings, right?

513
00:36:55,373 --> 00:36:57,320
Speaker 0: Cuz a quitting is also an ending sort of right.

514
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,536
Speaker 0: But yeah, if a game doesn't have an ending condition, it's not a game.

515
00:37:00,576 --> 00:37:01,159
Speaker 0: It's like a trap.

516
00:37:03,841 --> 00:37:15,136
Speaker 0: You're stuck in this in this, you know fake rule set like, you know, it's like, you know The law of the world is is not a game even though it's rules that you follow Right because you can't escape it.

517
00:37:15,867 --> 00:37:16,420
Speaker 0: It's not easy.

518
00:37:18,221 --> 00:37:29,674
Speaker 1: And when all players don't want our bankrupt if it just didn't say that if the just it was just like whoever has the most Money and the game just keeps going Yeah, what doesn't even say whoever has the most money just says roll the dice and keep moving.

519
00:37:29,694 --> 00:37:33,918
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know It's not a game has to have an ending, right?

520
00:37:35,827 --> 00:37:40,240
Speaker 0: So The thing is it's like, okay, you're designing a game, right?

521
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:44,780
Speaker 0: You have to have an ending or you have to write a rule that says the game ends when X right?

522
00:37:44,881 --> 00:37:48,740
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter if it's a video game or a board game or a sport, right?

523
00:37:49,001 --> 00:37:50,210
Speaker 0: You have to come up with this rule.

524
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:51,340
Speaker 0: When does the game like pause?

525
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:59,820
Speaker 0: So one player gets ten points the game ends that frame Right, and of course, we're also all only talking about ortho games, right?

526
00:37:59,940 --> 00:38:00,703
Speaker 0: You know, it's like when does?

527
00:38:01,045 --> 00:38:02,912
Speaker 0: when should your win should D&D end?

528
00:38:02,972 --> 00:38:04,800
Speaker 0: when should your tabletop role-playing game end?

529
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,160
Speaker 0: When should your single-player video game end whenever you feel like it?

530
00:38:09,243 --> 00:38:12,417
Speaker 0: When should Animal Crossing end whenever you feel like you have to be Bowser?

531
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:14,326
Speaker 1: No, you don't Know.

532
00:38:14,346 --> 00:38:15,337
Speaker 0: you could just stop, right?

533
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:31,479
Speaker 0: But if it's a game where it's a competitive game between two or more parties teams players where there is some sort of ranking system to determine who is the winner and and you need an end point and that that Endpoint is also when you say who the what you declare the winner right at the same time.

534
00:38:31,902 --> 00:38:35,280
Speaker 0: So the victory conditions are really tied in with the with the ending conditions.

535
00:38:35,380 --> 00:38:38,980
Speaker 0: But the point is we're only talking about the endings of ortho games, right?

536
00:38:39,542 --> 00:38:43,814
Speaker 0: So, let's talk about the different types of endings that are out there.

537
00:38:44,015 --> 00:38:44,175
Speaker 0: right.

538
00:38:44,196 --> 00:38:45,680
Speaker 0: so we already mentioned timed ending.

539
00:38:45,982 --> 00:38:48,055
Speaker 0: Right, you just play until a certain time.

540
00:38:48,075 --> 00:38:53,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Right, we play until a certain score.

541
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:56,017
Speaker 0: pong you get ten points then the game is right.

542
00:38:56,057 --> 00:39:06,740
Speaker 1: as soon as someone gets ten points We're in board games play until one of three highly specific things within this game occur Like someone builds this particular building or someone uses up all the victory point chips.

543
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,220
Speaker 0: Yeah, that would be like a resource clock.

544
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:17,740
Speaker 0: Those are sort of clocks, but they're sort of abstracted clocks to where it's like, okay There's a pile of sheep in the game and we're gonna end the game when there's no more sheep left.

545
00:39:17,740 --> 00:39:18,469
Speaker 0: It's like well, that's also.

546
00:39:18,510 --> 00:39:19,259
Speaker 0: that's sort of a clock.

547
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:21,129
Speaker 0: It's just sort of a player controlled clock.

548
00:39:21,229 --> 00:39:22,938
Speaker 0: to some extent they could take more or less.

549
00:39:22,978 --> 00:39:25,110
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Like sheep some of those sheep

550
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:28,025
Speaker 0: are constantly being used though Like so we like sheep back

551
00:39:28,346 --> 00:39:35,552
Speaker 1: always slowly wind down and players might be able to like pump the gas or pump the brakes But some of them are a clock that the players have complete control over.

552
00:39:35,632 --> 00:39:38,281
Speaker 1: like as soon as any one player does X the game Ends.

553
00:39:38,321 --> 00:39:44,019
Speaker 1: like the clock is just one bit like one minute from midnight and any player can walk over just push it.

554
00:39:44,702 --> 00:39:46,479
Speaker 0: Right, some games don't have it.

555
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:53,210
Speaker 0: They have an ending but the ending is sort of not indeterminate like go Right just sort of ends when both players agree.

556
00:39:53,270 --> 00:39:54,173
Speaker 0: like ah, yes.

557
00:39:54,233 --> 00:39:54,856
Speaker 0: This is ended.

558
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:55,538
Speaker 0: you have won, right?

559
00:39:56,842 --> 00:39:57,204
Speaker 0: And they can.

560
00:39:57,264 --> 00:40:00,000
Speaker 0: usually rather than playing it's like the board is a hundred percent full.

561
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:01,084
Speaker 0: This is the final score.

562
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:05,900
Speaker 0: like they can just sort of see that what this who's who has won and has taken more territory?

563
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:09,760
Speaker 1: I realize we we do that with our train games to to a significant degree.

564
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:13,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's because the games have problems which we're going to talk about.

565
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:18,250
Speaker 0: Yeah Some games will have multiple ending conditions.

566
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:21,726
Speaker 0: the game ends when a or B or C and You know this.

567
00:40:21,746 --> 00:40:23,140
Speaker 0: it could end in three different ways.

568
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:28,300
Speaker 0: Puerto Rico could end with someone fills up on buildings or when the colonists run out or when the victory points run out.

569
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,080
Speaker 0: So it's like three clocks and whichever one is the fastest.

570
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:39,255
Speaker 1: No I found usually in those cases one of the clocks is the is the clock that runs out first 90% of the time like very rarely, but do they run out?

571
00:40:39,295 --> 00:40:40,380
Speaker 0: but there are other games.

572
00:40:40,621 --> 00:40:42,369
Speaker 0: I'm just talking about the idea of several clocks.

573
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:43,836
Speaker 0: I'm just using Puerto Rico as an example.

574
00:40:43,857 --> 00:40:46,934
Speaker 0: There's no point in Exploring Puerto Rico itself, right?

575
00:40:46,995 --> 00:40:47,640
Speaker 0: It's not relevant.

576
00:40:49,121 --> 00:40:58,161
Speaker 0: So there are some games with that have multiple conditions where one of the conditions is like the main Condition like say route in route you're trying to get X victory points to 30.

577
00:40:58,161 --> 00:41:01,740
Speaker 0: I think I forget how many some number of victory points where you win route.

578
00:41:02,662 --> 00:41:05,469
Speaker 0: But there's a secret escape hatch dominance, right?

579
00:41:05,489 --> 00:41:06,371
Speaker 0: It's like the game.

580
00:41:06,532 --> 00:41:15,959
Speaker 0: and and when someone gets this many points or It ends when this other thing there's a secret way to end the game on the side, right?

581
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:21,120
Speaker 0: Some games combine multiple things together, right?

582
00:41:22,006 --> 00:41:24,204
Speaker 0: So for example Boxing right.

583
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:32,169
Speaker 0: you could end the game when there's after a certain number of rounds that have been agreed to beforehand or When someone gets knocked the fuck out right.

584
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:35,000
Speaker 0: two different ways for a boxing match to add counter-strike.

585
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:39,739
Speaker 0: You can end when you kill the entire other team knock the fuck out or the bomb goes off.

586
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:41,999
Speaker 0: I mean two different two different ways to end.

587
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:46,960
Speaker 0: Another thing is you get there's player elimination endings, right?

588
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:51,239
Speaker 0: So some games that have player elimination the game doesn't end for everyone at the same time.

589
00:41:51,881 --> 00:41:57,440
Speaker 0: It ends for one player one or more players at a time and eventually only one player or team remains.

590
00:41:57,841 --> 00:42:01,633
Speaker 1: And I guess there are games that are just eliminate players until only one is left.

591
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:02,396
Speaker 0: Yes.

592
00:42:02,677 --> 00:42:07,259
Speaker 0: Yes, there are And those are all the game endings I could think of.

593
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:12,446
Speaker 0: So if anyone thinks of any that don't fit into one of those categories Right.

594
00:42:12,992 --> 00:42:20,142
Speaker 0: Let me know Because you know, I pretty much every game I could think of, you know, since those categories are kind of broad Right.

595
00:42:20,303 --> 00:42:23,680
Speaker 0: It was it's you know, every game pretty much falls into one of those.

596
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:26,400
Speaker 1: I feel like one aspect of this panel like in the last third.

597
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:30,997
Speaker 1: Well could be picking up several specific games and exploring them using.

598
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:35,495
Speaker 0: we got analogy Yeah, but it's like, you know, you think of like, oh well that games difference like.

599
00:42:35,535 --> 00:42:36,620
Speaker 0: no, that's a resource clock.

600
00:42:36,901 --> 00:42:38,029
Speaker 0: Yeah, oh that game is different.

601
00:42:38,069 --> 00:42:39,660
Speaker 0: No, that's an escape hatch on the side.

602
00:42:39,961 --> 00:42:56,060
Speaker 1: Okay, like how when we talk about like the end of games in terms of like what determines winning Once all players are grandmaster superstars and all games are either random arbitrary or solved like same thing No game does not fit into one of those three categories and arguably two of those categories are the same

603
00:42:56,901 --> 00:42:57,021
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

604
00:42:57,463 --> 00:42:58,066
Speaker 0: So we've.

605
00:42:58,728 --> 00:43:01,500
Speaker 0: those are all the ways the game can end that we could think of right?

606
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:06,820
Speaker 0: So you're designing a game and you have to write this ending rules for your game that you're designing.

607
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:09,427
Speaker 0: Which one of those do you pick?

608
00:43:09,527 --> 00:43:12,880
Speaker 0: how what how are we going to somehow objectively determine?

609
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,352
Speaker 0: What is the best ending for your game?

610
00:43:15,372 --> 00:43:16,820
Speaker 0: We don't want the game to be too short.

611
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:20,071
Speaker 0: If the game is too short, it'll be an unsatisfying experience.

612
00:43:20,372 --> 00:43:22,460
Speaker 0: I didn't get to play with all the toys in the game.

613
00:43:22,540 --> 00:43:25,680
Speaker 0: Right, imagine playing like Magic the Gathering and you only have one, you know.

614
00:43:26,041 --> 00:43:28,832
Speaker 0: They decided you have 20 hit points in Magic the Gathering right?

615
00:43:29,153 --> 00:43:30,840
Speaker 0: Imagine if you magic that you get to life.

616
00:43:31,181 --> 00:43:31,965
Speaker 0: It'd be like lightning bolt.

617
00:43:32,186 --> 00:43:33,653
Speaker 0: It's like I didn't had a whole deck of cars.

618
00:43:33,713 --> 00:43:34,577
Speaker 0: I didn't even get to play with.

619
00:43:34,598 --> 00:43:35,060
Speaker 0: that's not fun.

620
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:38,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, or maybe give everyone sure that I want to build at the end.

621
00:43:38,336 --> 00:43:39,120
Speaker 1: I never get it up.

622
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,033
Speaker 1: No game will ever go on long enough for me to use that creature right.

623
00:43:42,275 --> 00:43:44,386
Speaker 0: if you gave everyone 50 health It's like okay.

624
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:46,740
Speaker 0: Well now everyone no one dies from health.

625
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:52,237
Speaker 0: Everyone dies from running out of deck right because the game goes so long or then players start coming in with.

626
00:43:52,277 --> 00:43:54,796
Speaker 1: here's my 400 card Deck, let's go, right.

627
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:59,860
Speaker 0: And it's also another example of a game with multiple ending conditions and victory conditions.

628
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,733
Speaker 0: Right where deck or life or poison or whatever.

629
00:44:04,355 --> 00:44:05,820
Speaker 1: right as a house side?

630
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:09,291
Speaker 1: I was obsessed with winning magic games.

631
00:44:09,372 --> 00:44:11,720
Speaker 1: Like when I was deep into magic by anything other than hit points.

632
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:17,923
Speaker 1: I really wanted to win with poison or deck run out to the point that I tried to force it to the exclusion of Everything else right?

633
00:44:18,304 --> 00:44:23,900
Speaker 0: So how are we going to determine what makes a good game ending and what makes a bad game ending, right?

634
00:44:23,942 --> 00:44:33,652
Speaker 0: Okay So the first thing that makes a bad game ending and I think this is pretty much this this bad thing is like the worst Bad thing which is pretty much the.

635
00:44:33,954 --> 00:44:44,519
Speaker 0: the primary Motivation for this panel right is this one bad thing which is when the victory condition occurs before the ending condition.

636
00:44:45,523 --> 00:44:48,771
Speaker 0: So we have already figured out who has won the game.

637
00:44:48,791 --> 00:44:51,940
Speaker 0: right it has already been pretty much determined.

638
00:44:52,441 --> 00:45:06,260
Speaker 0: Yet the ending rules for the game are such that the game is not over and thus we are forced into what is known as Garbage time which is where players one or more players must continue to play the game because it's not over or they're not eliminated.

639
00:45:06,922 --> 00:45:09,249
Speaker 0: But we already know who has won this game.

640
00:45:09,269 --> 00:45:11,557
Speaker 0: There is no reason for us to keep playing.

641
00:45:11,617 --> 00:45:12,479
Speaker 0: Why are we doing this?

642
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:17,567
Speaker 0: Right, obviously the most Number one culprit is monopoly that everyone knows.

643
00:45:17,828 --> 00:45:22,100
Speaker 0: even even non nerds know that monopolies over before it's over and they just stop playing.

644
00:45:22,188 --> 00:45:34,320
Speaker 1: Yeah But this applies to it a lot more games than people realize think it applies to so many freaking a lot of players, honestly Never fully understand a lot of the games they play enough to recognize when this is happening.

645
00:45:34,942 --> 00:45:40,080
Speaker 0: Well that that is the thing that absolutely happens is that people do not realize the game is over even though it's over.

646
00:45:40,281 --> 00:45:43,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, which is actually that helps the game, right?

647
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:47,960
Speaker 1: Even though through no fault of the games like age of steam like you can be losing that game.

648
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:50,760
Speaker 1: But not notice because the mechanics of the game are fun enough for you.

649
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:51,844
Speaker 0: Right, just give Hudson with them.

650
00:45:52,226 --> 00:45:57,620
Speaker 0: right if players don't notice that the game is over when it's not over They won't be upset.

651
00:45:57,761 --> 00:46:03,127
Speaker 0: But if you do notice that it's over when it's not over Then it's not fun to play anymore.

652
00:46:03,147 --> 00:46:04,432
Speaker 0: because you're like, why am I doing this?

653
00:46:04,453 --> 00:46:04,834
Speaker 0: I'm Mike.

654
00:46:05,015 --> 00:46:06,220
Speaker 0: I only have so much time in my life.

655
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,579
Speaker 0: Why am I spending it doing this BS?

656
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:10,499
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember we do you and I got 41 playing Puerto Rico.

657
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,510
Speaker 1: We'd be like four rounds in and be like, well Alex won.

658
00:46:13,530 --> 00:46:15,417
Speaker 1: let's just start over let's just stop right yet.

659
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:16,180
Speaker 0: Yep.

660
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:23,820
Speaker 0: Also, sometimes even though a game may not have a winner already determined, right?

661
00:46:24,220 --> 00:46:24,441
Speaker 0: It will.

662
00:46:24,963 --> 00:46:26,249
Speaker 0: they will have a loser right?

663
00:46:26,269 --> 00:46:26,972
Speaker 0: So this happens.

664
00:46:26,993 --> 00:46:28,419
Speaker 0: it gives us more than two players only.

665
00:46:29,702 --> 00:46:31,532
Speaker 1: Get politics in right.

666
00:46:31,573 --> 00:46:35,230
Speaker 0: you got four player game Right and one of the turn three.

667
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,360
Speaker 0: one of the players is doing so badly.

668
00:46:37,441 --> 00:46:38,519
Speaker 1: They can't win like a train game.

669
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:42,960
Speaker 1: We played a little while ago where I just made a really big mistake early on and there I was just done.

670
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:45,480
Speaker 1: There's literally nothing I could do to catch up, right?

671
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:53,000
Speaker 0: So it's like if you don't eliminate that player or and that you could end the game too, right and declare a winner.

672
00:46:53,363 --> 00:47:02,009
Speaker 0: But if you don't eliminate that player Then that player is now a spoiler that is gonna mess with the rest of the game Even though the other players have a reason to continue playing.

673
00:47:02,049 --> 00:47:03,855
Speaker 0: so you should eliminate them.

674
00:47:03,875 --> 00:47:14,260
Speaker 1: or you know It becomes political that player can choose the winner or The game changes and it becomes how do the other players exploit the losing player, right?

675
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:15,062
Speaker 0: Now that's all.

676
00:47:15,122 --> 00:47:19,400
Speaker 0: all that stuff is well and good in a non-competitive storytelling game, right?

677
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:24,280
Speaker 0: But we're talking about ortho games where we care about winning and losing and that sort of thing would be undesirable.

678
00:47:24,481 --> 00:47:25,043
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

679
00:47:25,344 --> 00:47:26,248
Speaker 0: It would also be under.

680
00:47:26,328 --> 00:47:33,162
Speaker 0: and it's it's funny because usually we talk about the opposed motivations of spectators versus Participants.

681
00:47:33,685 --> 00:47:43,396
Speaker 0: right, but actually when it comes to game endings the What benefits spectators is pretty much in perfect alignment with which what benefits true layers?

682
00:47:43,416 --> 00:47:46,899
Speaker 1: imagine like you're watching a football game Where the one team's up 70 to nothing.

683
00:47:48,023 --> 00:47:49,190
Speaker 0: You turn it on change channel.

684
00:47:49,411 --> 00:47:49,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, right.

685
00:47:49,955 --> 00:47:50,478
Speaker 1: This is your reasons.

686
00:47:51,044 --> 00:47:52,059
Speaker 1: You're there for that.

687
00:47:52,180 --> 00:48:01,376
Speaker 0: But right if you're watching a game or participate right and someone's participating right the reasons You want the game to end it generally the same time.

688
00:48:01,617 --> 00:48:05,110
Speaker 0: right, you know When when victory has been determined close games are exciting.

689
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:05,893
Speaker 0: They keep you there.

690
00:48:05,933 --> 00:48:07,920
Speaker 0: They keep you there for extra innings, right?

691
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,372
Speaker 0: You want to keep watching that close tied baseball game into extra innings.

692
00:48:11,392 --> 00:48:15,025
Speaker 0: So, you know what spectator and the player until they get tired.

693
00:48:15,125 --> 00:48:22,860
Speaker 1: listener Avi just said something very interesting that I'm thinking about now because we just thought I just said like Oh and you're up by 70 points like oh you turn off the game.

694
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:29,020
Speaker 1: But the reality is I'm watching the Rangers and Z bads gotten five goals and the game's over but there's two more periods.

695
00:48:29,541 --> 00:48:36,060
Speaker 1: I'm actually more invested because now it's just like I get to watch this pounding and what this listener just said was that I quote.

696
00:48:36,421 --> 00:48:41,360
Speaker 1: My cousin said she likes that monopoly has so much garbage time because it lets her celebrate her victory.

697
00:48:41,701 --> 00:48:48,360
Speaker 1: She's the one who won and she gets to sit there forcing everyone to deal with the fact that she won until they either quit.

698
00:48:49,182 --> 00:48:54,236
Speaker 0: I'm sorry that your cousin is a sociopath, but I as a spectator watching a sport.

699
00:48:55,580 --> 00:49:00,558
Speaker 1: I I would glad like we that Newman game the hockey game we talked about where the RIT won 24 to nothing.

700
00:49:01,803 --> 00:49:04,898
Speaker 1: Would we leave in the second period when they were only up 14 to nothing?

701
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:11,976
Speaker 0: There was there a special circumstances outside the game of us Burying the other team that made it enjoyable.

702
00:49:12,077 --> 00:49:19,876
Speaker 0: if you were there Any less bad or if you were alone in the arena watching that you would have left earlier, I don't know.

703
00:49:19,896 --> 00:49:22,084
Speaker 1: I Don't know.

704
00:49:22,105 --> 00:49:24,018
Speaker 1: I feel like there's something to explore here.

705
00:49:24,933 --> 00:49:25,239
Speaker 0: anyway.

706
00:49:27,041 --> 00:49:38,075
Speaker 0: The point is is when the end of the game comes too far after the victory has already been determined It it's very unsatisfying in most cases like the Super Bowl is actually a perfect example there.

707
00:49:38,376 --> 00:49:46,240
Speaker 1: if the Super Bowl is determined in the first Like half I just don't even watch the second half, but if it's a blowout toward the end and there's only a few minutes left.

708
00:49:46,281 --> 00:49:47,540
Speaker 1: That's a totally different situation.

709
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:52,900
Speaker 0: So ideally you want some alignment between the victory condition and the ending condition.

710
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:55,950
Speaker 0: Right such that you know pong is in tennis.

711
00:49:55,970 --> 00:49:56,753
Speaker 0: They're perfect, right?

712
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:58,117
Speaker 0: It's like it's ten.

713
00:49:58,197 --> 00:49:58,940
Speaker 0: It's nine to one.

714
00:49:59,141 --> 00:50:00,568
Speaker 0: Well, the other person can still win.

715
00:50:00,609 --> 00:50:02,700
Speaker 0: they can score nine in a row, right and watch them.

716
00:50:02,860 --> 00:50:05,648
Speaker 0: I got ten stuff like a men's immediately all the time.

717
00:50:05,668 --> 00:50:20,610
Speaker 0: I Was in like a Verizon store who I was with someone who was buying a new phone and There was I think it was US Open was on maybe so, you know a year or two ago I don't remember last year.

718
00:50:20,631 --> 00:50:23,325
Speaker 0: I don't know whatever and Thousand years ago.

719
00:50:23,345 --> 00:50:25,879
Speaker 0: I think it might have been like exactly a year ago.

720
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:30,115
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is Federer was on TV and I saw it.

721
00:50:30,356 --> 00:50:31,200
Speaker 0: He had match point.

722
00:50:32,284 --> 00:50:32,788
Speaker 0: He didn't win.

723
00:50:32,809 --> 00:50:36,259
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Remember that very specifically.

724
00:50:37,742 --> 00:50:39,278
Speaker 0: So that's that's one thing.

725
00:50:41,541 --> 00:50:49,160
Speaker 0: Another thing you want to avoid right that can be bad is Let me look at my what I wrote.

726
00:50:49,803 --> 00:50:53,100
Speaker 1: See, this is why we spend some effort on these panels before we like finish them.

727
00:50:53,521 --> 00:50:58,140
Speaker 1: You you guys don't usually see the like us putting it together and figuring out our ideas.

728
00:50:58,301 --> 00:51:00,790
Speaker 1: I'm making sure the points are making are consistent.

729
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:05,489
Speaker 0: All right, so if the ending condition Happens too soon.

730
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:06,959
Speaker 0: I talked about this a little bit already.

731
00:51:07,542 --> 00:51:11,460
Speaker 0: Right, the game can often be unsatisfying because you didn't get to play the whole game.

732
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,571
Speaker 0: Imagine playing Puerto Rico and you only got to build a few buildings.

733
00:51:14,611 --> 00:51:14,993
Speaker 0: You didn't get.

734
00:51:15,013 --> 00:51:16,920
Speaker 0: you never get to use the big buildings, right?

735
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:25,401
Speaker 0: But there are other problems with that too besides not being able to play with all the toys and that Is.

736
00:51:25,421 --> 00:51:32,480
Speaker 0: it gives a great advantage to players who are using aggressive strategy up or set plays like or right?

737
00:51:32,641 --> 00:51:33,665
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

738
00:51:33,705 --> 00:51:37,440
Speaker 0: this game in this game ends very very quickly, right?

739
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:40,142
Speaker 0: There's a way to end it after like two turns Right.

740
00:51:40,443 --> 00:51:44,416
Speaker 0: So there's a thing I can do to score as many points as I can in two turns.

741
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:49,960
Speaker 0: and now any Longer term strategy now becomes like unviable, right?

742
00:51:50,380 --> 00:51:54,394
Speaker 0: So like in Magic the Gathering again, or usually see in CCGs a lot.

743
00:51:54,515 --> 00:52:07,009
Speaker 0: or you know other games, you know there's always Agro verse control people talk about right whereas like Agro is play small cheap things early, you know Do lots of damage right away.

744
00:52:07,109 --> 00:52:09,360
Speaker 0: me go face in Hearthstone, right?

745
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:15,998
Speaker 0: Becomes very strong because you can end the game quickly and then control is don't lose don't lose don't lose.

746
00:52:17,503 --> 00:52:21,300
Speaker 0: The game goes on long enough and now I can play cards that cost a fortune.

747
00:52:21,802 --> 00:52:23,448
Speaker 0: Right that I couldn't play on turn one.

748
00:52:23,829 --> 00:52:25,857
Speaker 0: and now the person who played up was Agro.

749
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:26,800
Speaker 0: played all their cards.

750
00:52:26,861 --> 00:52:27,689
Speaker 0: They don't have any left.

751
00:52:27,749 --> 00:52:28,638
Speaker 0: and now I can win you.

752
00:52:28,679 --> 00:52:31,932
Speaker 1: this The meta a little bit like I remember in the revised era of Magic.

753
00:52:31,973 --> 00:52:39,620
Speaker 1: there were some periods where tournament play Burn decks like just a red fucko deck Pretty much like they wouldn't win a hundred percent of the time.

754
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:42,679
Speaker 1: But they were so powerful that you really couldn't try other strategies.

755
00:52:43,001 --> 00:52:57,825
Speaker 0: You need to balance that ending condition right if you have this sort of Agro control lineup in your game strategies such that Agro can win right and Control can win.

756
00:52:57,845 --> 00:53:02,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, and so you want to like get it just on that line right there - we're like.

757
00:53:03,103 --> 00:53:06,519
Speaker 0: You know Agro can't win too fast because then controls busted.

758
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:09,900
Speaker 0: They know what game weirdly and you can't make it.

759
00:53:09,900 --> 00:53:16,200
Speaker 0: So Agro goes too late because if Agro takes too long to win then control comes in and Agro can't win.

760
00:53:16,501 --> 00:53:20,840
Speaker 1: You know what game actually illustrates that pretty well and I think walks that line very well that old tabletop game.

761
00:53:20,921 --> 00:53:22,130
Speaker 1: No one remembers this game.

762
00:53:22,231 --> 00:53:22,594
Speaker 1: I like it.

763
00:53:23,037 --> 00:53:23,320
Speaker 1: Attica.

764
00:53:24,342 --> 00:53:26,874
Speaker 1: Yeah, the temples or or or normal game.

765
00:53:27,075 --> 00:53:32,640
Speaker 1: you'll play the normal game But someone could win with the temples and yeah, if someone starts going for it, you got to stop them.

766
00:53:33,002 --> 00:53:34,531
Speaker 1: It's you can win that way.

767
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:36,080
Speaker 1: That is a perfectly valid way to win.

768
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:36,803
Speaker 1: I've seen it happen.

769
00:53:37,405 --> 00:53:38,951
Speaker 0: or there's no going back a game.

770
00:53:38,991 --> 00:53:40,757
Speaker 0: We reviewed recently that we played effects.

771
00:53:40,777 --> 00:53:41,480
Speaker 0: ease, right?

772
00:53:41,820 --> 00:53:50,740
Speaker 0: you know like tons and tons of games have that dynamic of Agro and control and You need to make sure you can't have your ending condition happen too soon, right?

773
00:53:50,962 --> 00:54:01,559
Speaker 0: Too late is a problem because you get garbage time but too soon is a problem because then aggressive strategies become favored and long-term plays become worthless and a lot of this.

774
00:54:01,659 --> 00:54:04,709
Speaker 0: your Game content doesn't get used because you have it.

775
00:54:04,930 --> 00:54:08,080
Speaker 0: doesn't that game content never happens until you get to the late game.

776
00:54:08,752 --> 00:54:09,684
Speaker 1: That's the worst I can think of.

777
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:11,620
Speaker 1: a lot of magic playing Starcraft.

778
00:54:12,162 --> 00:54:16,076
Speaker 0: Imagine playing Starcraft and you build infantry and you can destroy the enemy base with infantry.

779
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:18,047
Speaker 0: You never use tanks You never use planes.

780
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:19,660
Speaker 0: You never use anything, right?

781
00:54:19,741 --> 00:54:21,196
Speaker 0: You just play it with infantry.

782
00:54:21,297 --> 00:54:31,615
Speaker 1: Yep I feel like when like an agro strategy tends to be overpowered usually it's because that is actually a Degenerate strategy in the game like Kayla's old Kayla's.

783
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:38,460
Speaker 1: there's all these different ways You can win in that tabletop game, but there's really only two paths that are viable and one of them is just superior.

784
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:40,853
Speaker 1: So there's really no point in trying anything else.

785
00:54:40,873 --> 00:54:44,147
Speaker 0: Don't even mess with those other systems Alright, so I mean so here's what you do.

786
00:54:44,167 --> 00:54:47,980
Speaker 0: You want to figure out the perfect ending time ending method for your game, right?

787
00:54:48,402 --> 00:54:50,672
Speaker 0: So there's a. there's a way we can do this mathematically.

788
00:54:50,732 --> 00:54:52,560
Speaker 0: is it make a chart and on the chart?

789
00:54:52,700 --> 00:55:00,716
Speaker 0: We're gonna graph time on the x-axis and on the y-axis We're gonna do percent chance to win and we're gonna draw a line for each participant, right?

790
00:55:01,378 --> 00:55:11,959
Speaker 0: So, okay Well, so the player doing Agro, you know It's probably gonna have a big spike and then come down a whole bunch and the control player will have sort of a longer Low line that then spikes up later, right?

791
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:13,123
Speaker 0: Something like that.

792
00:55:13,223 --> 00:55:24,463
Speaker 1: and I feel like maybe in play testing you if you gather data on a game You can turn that graph into a heat map and see if there's a nice like linear progression there if your average plays over time Right.

793
00:55:24,503 --> 00:55:27,996
Speaker 0: It's like maybe play your game without an ending condition, right?

794
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:31,266
Speaker 0: Maybe say like You know magic right?

795
00:55:31,286 --> 00:55:32,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's.

796
00:55:32,711 --> 00:55:35,100
Speaker 0: no we're not going to say how many hit points it takes to win.

797
00:55:35,220 --> 00:55:42,990
Speaker 0: We're just gonna do as many damage as you can right and we're gonna record how much damage everyone took on each turn Right over time.

798
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:48,719
Speaker 0: and then we're gonna say aha Here's the the over this many games where we've collected data, right?

799
00:55:49,340 --> 00:55:54,860
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, no matter regardless of which type of deck people were playing right on this turn.

800
00:55:55,321 --> 00:56:02,600
Speaker 0: You know the the 20th turn, you know the average damn, you know, most decks did about 30 damage by then, right?

801
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:17,360
Speaker 0: So if we set the HP to win at 30 and we start play testing that Then what will happen is the game will probably end around this turn and everyone should have kind of equal chance of winning and The game will be pretty close right, you know.

802
00:56:17,461 --> 00:56:18,660
Speaker 0: Just something basic like that.

803
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:28,926
Speaker 0: The problem is you can't just stop there because by setting the ending condition you are then affecting the Graph right?

804
00:56:29,408 --> 00:56:32,460
Speaker 0: It's like it's one of those things where it's like quantum physics, right?

805
00:56:32,600 --> 00:56:37,340
Speaker 0: As soon as you mess observe and mess with it, it moves you can't you can't pin it down, right?

806
00:56:38,103 --> 00:56:39,509
Speaker 0: So it's like aha.

807
00:56:39,569 --> 00:56:40,734
Speaker 0: We'll make the game end on.

808
00:56:40,815 --> 00:56:42,060
Speaker 0: I've determined mathematically.

809
00:56:42,241 --> 00:56:49,068
Speaker 0: We'll make the game end on turn 10 because on turn 10 and all the strategies are really close That'll be a really close ending right?

810
00:56:49,389 --> 00:56:51,639
Speaker 0: So whoever's ahead on turn 10 deserves to be the winner.

811
00:56:52,582 --> 00:57:02,349
Speaker 0: Oops by changing that rule players now play differently because they see the game will end on turn 10 and now on turn 9 They're all making crazy plays to get more points.

812
00:57:02,630 --> 00:57:05,740
Speaker 0: Hmm, right or you know stuff like that.

813
00:57:05,780 --> 00:57:07,028
Speaker 0: And it's like well that messes up.

814
00:57:07,088 --> 00:57:08,860
Speaker 0: all my data is now I got to move my line again.

815
00:57:09,161 --> 00:57:11,755
Speaker 1: I feel like there's a topic here kind of a side thing of.

816
00:57:11,775 --> 00:57:22,338
Speaker 1: there are a lot of games especially more like poorly designed tabletop games not so much in video games where What ends the game is complicated enough to where players can't fully engage with it or even predict it.

817
00:57:23,362 --> 00:57:26,273
Speaker 0: Well, sometimes they can control it right so you could make a game.

818
00:57:26,333 --> 00:57:28,200
Speaker 0: where if do the resource clock, right?

819
00:57:28,340 --> 00:57:29,664
Speaker 0: So here's how you do the resource clock.

820
00:57:29,945 --> 00:57:38,920
Speaker 0: you do the same data gathering right with your ending condition and you say, okay, you know on turn You know this looks like about the time the game should end, right?

821
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:42,115
Speaker 0: This is where you know, I looked at how the players were doing on average.

822
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:43,060
Speaker 0: I collected all this data.

823
00:57:43,181 --> 00:57:52,824
Speaker 0: This is when the game should end and you say, okay Rather than you know Saying the game ends when a player gets X points because that's the score that players had at that time on average or whatever Right.

824
00:57:52,844 --> 00:58:00,793
Speaker 0: you say okay at that point in the game what were the average number of Lands played right in total?

825
00:58:01,456 --> 00:58:06,555
Speaker 0: and you say oh, okay Well, we'll just make the game end when you know that many lands are played right?

826
00:58:06,575 --> 00:58:46,820
Speaker 0: You can look at all the different quantifiable resources in the game Real time in the world number of turns player score player money player cards in hand player cards and deck player Properties owned player money, whatever it is in all the resources that are in your game Whatever your game is tiles left in the stack and carcass own meeples left, whatever Right, and if you graph those you can pick any one of them Right and say oh well and the game based on that one or that one or a combination of three of them Right by looking at what their values were at the right time in your little in your data gathering Right and any one of those could become your game ending clock.

827
00:58:48,224 --> 00:58:51,040
Speaker 0: And of course though as soon as you choose one, right?

828
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,118
Speaker 0: Like I said, the players are going to move based on that.

829
00:58:55,198 --> 00:59:00,820
Speaker 0: if you say All right magic ends when the 20th land is played someone's gonna make a deck that just rushes land onto the board.

830
00:59:01,423 --> 00:59:09,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, right to end the game immediately, right, you know They'll do one damage and then they'll rush 20 lands and now messes up your whole thing.

831
00:59:09,439 --> 00:59:11,926
Speaker 0: Yeah So it's it's very so.

832
00:59:11,966 --> 00:59:13,732
Speaker 0: you have to basically make this.

833
00:59:13,753 --> 00:59:19,999
Speaker 0: you have to collect this data pick something Playtest pick a different thing play test pick a different thing.

834
00:59:20,462 --> 00:59:24,985
Speaker 0: But the metrics you're looking for in your play tests Right are the game.

835
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:30,103
Speaker 0: I should go long enough for everyone to enjoy the whole game and all the things there are to do in The game.

836
00:59:30,123 --> 00:59:32,780
Speaker 0: you don't want it to end before people get to play with all the toys.

837
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:46,440
Speaker 0: Right, you don't want the game to go too long into garbage time where people are sitting around doing nothing and playing for no reason When someone's already won, right you want it to end is right before it's hard to actually mess up ending to you.

838
00:59:46,561 --> 00:59:48,479
Speaker 0: You know too soon is better than too late.

839
00:59:48,883 --> 00:59:52,347
Speaker 0: Right, if you end the game a turn too soon You're probably not going to be upset.

840
00:59:53,010 --> 00:59:55,220
Speaker 0: right if you end the game ten turns too soon.

841
00:59:55,300 --> 01:00:02,979
Speaker 0: Okay, yeah, but if you end the game two turns too late that you'll probably will be upset about that because you just wasted two frickin turns for no reason, right.

842
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:11,231
Speaker 0: So, you know err on the side of ending a little too early not a lot too early a little too early Right, plus people love shorter games.

843
01:00:11,271 --> 01:00:11,955
Speaker 0: It's more marketable.

844
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:15,614
Speaker 1: Yeah To most demographics at least right.

845
01:00:15,634 --> 01:00:21,140
Speaker 0: I'm talking about a little bit shorter Right, if you go crazy shorter problems a little bit shorter usually good, right?

846
01:00:21,380 --> 01:00:24,900
Speaker 0: Usually makes your game feel tight makes the fear of players feel pressured, right?

847
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:26,284
Speaker 0: It's like it's like a good thing.

848
01:00:26,304 --> 01:00:28,752
Speaker 0: All right, you know games where it's like.

849
01:00:28,772 --> 01:00:35,194
Speaker 0: I played out everything exactly perfectly And then it ended like that could be satisfying but I think it gets a little.

850
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:38,657
Speaker 0: you know players sort of rest easy Right, you don't get that excitement, right?

851
01:00:39,661 --> 01:00:47,860
Speaker 0: You're not like trying to score it on sides kick with two minutes left You know, that's you want that push right make your game and a turn earlier than you normally would have ended it.

852
01:00:49,724 --> 01:00:50,412
Speaker 0: Anything like that.

853
01:00:51,281 --> 01:00:54,112
Speaker 1: All right, so yes for over an hour.

854
01:00:54,293 --> 01:00:56,180
Speaker 0: so I think good but yeah the panel.

855
01:00:56,301 --> 01:00:58,920
Speaker 0: I wrote a lot more than that and more and a lot more details.

856
01:01:00,003 --> 01:01:05,274
Speaker 1: We're definitely gonna have like here's some case studies Like let's look at this game and see how these end mechanics actually work out.

857
01:01:05,294 --> 01:01:11,980
Speaker 0: Yep, exactly But yeah, that's that's what game endings are super important, right?

858
01:01:12,781 --> 01:01:20,680
Speaker 0: You could actually ruin a game that would otherwise be great by having bad ending rules And you can't save a bad game with good ending rules.

859
01:01:21,881 --> 01:01:25,660
Speaker 0: So no matter how you know, you've got to make a good game, right?

860
01:01:26,460 --> 01:01:30,260
Speaker 0: First and foremost, but that ending rule is going to be so important.

861
01:01:30,522 --> 01:01:38,155
Speaker 0: It could break it can't make the game, but it can break it And that's why this is really worth exploring in even great great detail.

862
01:01:38,175 --> 01:01:40,020
Speaker 0: I think exactly the right moment.

863
01:01:40,302 --> 01:01:42,858
Speaker 1: There's more than an hour's worth of content in this space.

864
01:01:43,703 --> 01:01:44,668
Speaker 0: Easily it's like.

865
01:01:44,749 --> 01:01:51,040
Speaker 0: it's like you probably do like a 10-week lecture Choosing the game ending right but think really hard.

866
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:53,828
Speaker 0: This is just the smallest aspect of gaming.

867
01:01:53,868 --> 01:01:57,319
Speaker 0: that applies to every all gaming video games sports board games everything.

868
01:01:58,403 --> 01:02:01,559
Speaker 0: So if you're making games think really hard about the ending.

869
01:02:06,275 --> 01:02:08,810
Speaker 1: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

870
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:13,610
Speaker 1: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 0: Geek nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

875
01:02:34,681 --> 01:02:36,165
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows.

876
01:02:36,286 --> 01:02:44,963
Speaker 1: It's actually recorded at night And the patreon patrons for this episode of geek nights are Alan Joyce, Heidi McNichol Marty green It's just like a dude guy Shartavish and Graham Finch.

877
01:02:44,983 --> 01:02:46,370
Speaker 1: You hold the key to my heart.

878
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:49,390
Speaker 1: She gave me a kiss and she gave me my ticket.

879
01:02:49,872 --> 01:03:12,110
Speaker 1: Clinton Walton Jay Vance ran from New Zealand Ryan Perrin Nicholas Brando Chris mid get the thirst Horhydrated Gannon dread Lily Tenebrae Chris Reimer Finn Sean Klein Shervin Ron Hall and a bunch of people who don't want me to say their Names might have noticed we stream this one again partly because We don't want to distract from the protests, but they seem to be getting a lot of things done and the needle is moving.

880
01:03:12,193 --> 01:03:12,587
Speaker 1: Keep it up.

881
01:03:12,971 --> 01:03:18,927
Speaker 1: but we are slowly resuming normal geek nights operations also partly because we use that time to completely rejig our pipeline.

882
01:03:19,268 --> 01:03:31,888
Speaker 1: to avoid the Nondeterministic latency in streaming at some point in the future I'll probably do a little Patreon exclusive where I'll explain the previous pipeline and why it failed and why I wasn't willing to deal with fixing it and then the new pipeline.

883
01:03:31,909 --> 01:03:32,972
Speaker 1: that seems to Be working fine.

884
01:03:33,013 --> 01:03:38,678
Speaker 1: that pretty much just involves discord and carving Scott's face out of the discord We're using to do the show.

885
01:03:39,322 --> 01:03:42,659
Speaker 1: But anyway all that aside Stay tuned for shows as usual.

886
01:03:42,679 --> 01:03:52,795
Speaker 1: I don't know if we'll do one on Thursday because the holidays beginning Maybe we'll just take a break, but I leave you for now with something that Well, I don't know what you're gonna think of this.

887
01:03:53,457 --> 01:03:59,359
Speaker 2: by greeting the guest warmly and holding brief conversations as you serve them You say to our guests?

888
01:04:00,022 --> 01:04:03,380
Speaker 2: We're glad you're here Let's take a closer.

889
01:04:03,420 --> 01:04:04,569
Speaker 2: Look at greeting guests.

890
01:04:05,393 --> 01:04:08,866
Speaker 2: Every conversation you hold with guests should begin something like this.

891
01:04:09,388 --> 01:04:12,609
Speaker 0: Good evening Or hi, how are you?

892
01:04:13,210 --> 01:04:15,919
Speaker 2: Once you've greeted the guest start a brief conversation.

893
01:04:16,521 --> 01:04:19,129
Speaker 2: try asking a question the guest can answer in a sense or two.

894
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:24,829
Speaker 2: You might ask something like this Is it still hot out there or this?

895
01:04:25,730 --> 01:04:27,859
Speaker 0: Did you catch a game last night or this?

896
01:04:28,461 --> 01:04:29,525

Speaker 0: It's my favorite.

898
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:34,889
Speaker 2: Don't forget to hold quick conversations with our younger guests to.

899
01:04:35,811 --> 01:04:39,730
Speaker 2: Children often play a big part in deciding which restaurant their parents visit.

900
01:04:40,273 --> 01:04:43,389
Speaker 2: We want them to feel welcome and special here, too.

901
01:04:44,192 --> 01:04:47,441
Speaker 2: So start conversations with children by saying something like this.

902
01:04:47,963 --> 01:04:49,347
Speaker 1: What grade are you in at school?

903
01:04:49,869 --> 01:04:50,230
