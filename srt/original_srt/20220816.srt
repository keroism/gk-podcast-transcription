1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,149
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, August 16th, 2022.

2
00:00:10,149 --> 00:00:10,350
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,365 --> 00:00:13,779
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,304
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,345 --> 00:00:19,780
Speaker 1: Tonight we are talking about casino games, like craps and shit.

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:21,858
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,761 --> 00:00:30,160
Speaker 0: Uh, so being a person who has no hair, I mean even when I had hair, I would often wear a baseball hat.

8
00:00:30,564 --> 00:00:31,179
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, yeah.

9
00:00:31,780 --> 00:00:36,160
Speaker 0: That's a thing I wear outside to protect my eyes from the cursed sun.

10
00:00:36,461 --> 00:00:40,916
Speaker 1: I get a couple of baseball adjacent hats and a bunch of bucket hats too.

11
00:00:40,956 --> 00:00:41,799
Speaker 1: I alternate between the two.

12
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:49,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think when I had hair, I had the fitted hat, right, so it's not adjustable in the back for you not hat experts.

13
00:00:51,421 --> 00:00:55,232
Speaker 0: And you have to get a hat that's just exactly the right size and they're usually made of wool.

14
00:00:55,633 --> 00:00:58,000
Speaker 0: so, you know, they'll shrink but they won't grow.

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:02,155
Speaker 0: So if you buy one too small you're in trouble and too big it won't shrink that much, right?

16
00:01:02,175 --> 00:01:03,480
Speaker 0: You have to be like exactly right.

17
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:12,020
Speaker 0: So, you know, since the other problem is that a lot of the fitted hats, in the front part, they have like this like buckram.

18
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,994
Speaker 0: It's like this white mesh kind of plastic deal and it keeps the front of the hat up, right?

19
00:01:19,536 --> 00:01:21,360
Speaker 0: So it doesn't like go pfft, you know?

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:29,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, most of my hats actually aren't like, because I don't wear baseball baseball caps, I just wear caps with rims so they kind of just collapse on the top of my head and that's fine.

21
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:34,191
Speaker 0: But anyway, but once I had no hair, right, the buckram becomes an issue.

22
00:01:34,211 --> 00:01:37,160
Speaker 0: It's not comfortable against a bald head.

23
00:01:37,563 --> 00:01:38,038
Speaker 1: That is true.

24
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:48,135
Speaker 0: And so I tried, I heard that people would like, you know, cut the buckram out of the hat and I was like to make it like collapse but still have a nice wool fitted hat.

25
00:01:48,155 --> 00:01:50,780
Speaker 0: and I attempted that on one hat and basically wasted a hat.

26
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:52,391
Speaker 0: That was bad.

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,425
Speaker 0: So I switched to getting the non-fitted hat, right?

28
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:02,209
Speaker 0: You know, just not the one with the snapback, right?

29
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:09,740
Speaker 0: Because that's, you know, cheap, the kind with like, you know, the cloth adjustable strap, right?

30
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,244
Speaker 1: I got one of those recently, actually.

31
00:02:11,304 --> 00:02:18,000
Speaker 1: I got a hat, Emily got a hat that's just like a production hat that just says "animator" and I got one that just says "producer" and I wear it sometimes.

32
00:02:20,221 --> 00:02:25,171
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I've had, you know, I had a Mets hat and a Rangers hat and you wear them seasonally, right?

33
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:26,594
Speaker 0: You don't want to wear a Rangers hat in the summer.

34
00:02:26,735 --> 00:02:27,155
Speaker 0: That's weird.

35
00:02:27,175 --> 00:02:29,360
Speaker 0: You don't want to wear a Mets hat in the winter.

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,860
Speaker 1: Actually on my run the other day I saw a guy just wearing a full-on Rangers jersey and Rangers cap just like walking in the park.

37
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,180
Speaker 0: Wasn't he warm?

38
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:36,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like 100 degrees.

39
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,383
Speaker 0: It's like, what the heck?

40
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:40,747
Speaker 0: It's a good warm out.

41
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:45,320
Speaker 0: I mean, I like it hot but, you know.

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,799
Speaker 1: I like it hot because I'm gonna wear shorts.

43
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:53,957
Speaker 0: A hockey jersey is like, you know, it's not like a coat but it kind of keeps you warm a little bit, right?

44
00:02:54,038 --> 00:02:54,980
Speaker 0: Warm enough in a hockey.

45
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,640
Speaker 1: Oh, in fact, I have often worn a hockey jersey as a middle layer instead of a fleece when I'm skiing.

46
00:03:02,121 --> 00:03:10,720
Speaker 0: So anyway, my Mets hat is pretty old and so it's all dirty and gross because another thing is when you have no hair, all your head sweat just absorbs right into the hat.

47
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,703
Speaker 0: That's disgusting.

48
00:03:12,823 --> 00:03:15,010
Speaker 0: So I attempted to wash the hat.

49
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:18,160
Speaker 0: So I got, you know, the wool light and I went for the hand wash, right?

50
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:23,000
Speaker 0: And I got someone, I watched some videos and people were like saying, "Yeah, take a toothbrush and you can scrub

51
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,080
Speaker 0: it.".

52
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:26,111
Speaker 0: I'm like, "Oh, I have many spare toothbrushes that will never be

53
00:03:26,232 --> 00:03:26,493
Speaker 0: used.".

54
00:03:27,055 --> 00:03:28,360
Speaker 0: I popped one open, right?

55
00:03:29,282 --> 00:03:32,160
Speaker 0: And I attempted to clean the hat, you know, rough thoroughly.

56
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,259
Speaker 1: Waste a second hat?

57
00:03:34,761 --> 00:03:35,103
Speaker 0: Uh, no.

58
00:03:35,263 --> 00:03:39,179
Speaker 0: And then I hung it up to dry and then I waited for it to be dry and then I checked it out.

59
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:41,359
Speaker 0: And it didn't look any cleaner.

60
00:03:44,002 --> 00:03:50,840
Speaker 0: So I went to the store today, uh, while I was in Manhattan, I went to the lids and I bought the literally the exact same hat.

61
00:03:51,881 --> 00:03:56,031
Speaker 0: Like the same brand, the same hat, 100 identical, only new.

62
00:03:56,993 --> 00:03:59,940
Speaker 0: And the hats are very different colors.

63
00:04:02,241 --> 00:04:06,249
Speaker 0: The old hat is like black blue, I want to say.

64
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:08,895
Speaker 0: And the new hat is bright blue.

65
00:04:08,915 --> 00:04:11,300
Speaker 0: This is a podcast, you can't see it.

66
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,213
Speaker 0: But, uh, the dirtiness level of the old hat is now very apparent.

67
00:04:16,373 --> 00:04:18,600
Speaker 0: It is an extremely stark contrast.

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,749
Speaker 1: See, I've avoided this because most of the hats I wear...

69
00:04:20,769 --> 00:04:23,220
Speaker 0: Disturbingly stark contrast between the two hat colors.

70
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,980
Speaker 1: Most of the hats I wear are black or they're like a sports hat, like a boating hat that's made out of a weird material.

71
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,079
Speaker 0: Because you're an old man, you wear an old man hat.

72
00:04:34,081 --> 00:04:39,140
Speaker 0: Most of the other hats I wear are cycling caps where it doesn't matter how dirty they are because I put a helmet on top.

73
00:04:40,262 --> 00:04:40,362
Speaker 1: Yep.

74
00:04:40,382 --> 00:04:47,780
Speaker 1: Actually, the hat I wear the most is just a baseball-like cap from H&M that I just bought for like five bucks a long time ago that somehow has not fallen apart.

75
00:04:51,142 --> 00:04:52,568
Speaker 1: So yeah, there's a ton of gaming news.

76
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:55,680
Speaker 1: We skipped Tuesday's show last week, so we had to catch up on a little bit.

77
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,187
Speaker 0: It's not a gaming season, right?

78
00:04:58,207 --> 00:05:01,660
Speaker 0: Because it's the summer, so there's not a lot of sitting inside playing video games happening.

79
00:05:02,781 --> 00:05:09,480
Speaker 1: And also, without the conventions, you know, COVID and everything, it's not like we're playing a ton of new board games, like, often enough to just have reviews every two weeks.

80
00:05:09,901 --> 00:05:11,925
Speaker 1: But, uh, there is a bunch of gaming news.

81
00:05:12,005 --> 00:05:15,512
Speaker 1: We'll start with, uh, there's a lot going on with Unity.

82
00:05:16,093 --> 00:05:24,194
Speaker 0: The gaming engine, like, basically Unity- I remember when, yeah, I remember when the Unity engine first came out, I was like, I had never heard of it.

83
00:05:24,294 --> 00:05:26,079
Speaker 0: And, you know, people were like, "Oh, yeah, we're using

84
00:05:26,179 --> 00:05:26,360
Speaker 0: Unity.".

85
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,102
Speaker 0: I'm like, "What the hell is

86
00:05:27,122 --> 00:05:27,343
Speaker 0: that?".

87
00:05:27,383 --> 00:05:28,326
Speaker 0: I never heard of that, right?

88
00:05:28,366 --> 00:05:31,394
Speaker 0: I've heard of Unreal Engine, I've heard of, you know, all these other engines.

89
00:05:31,454 --> 00:05:33,420
Speaker 0: I never heard of any freaking Unity engine.

90
00:05:34,021 --> 00:05:51,220
Speaker 0: But the thing that Unity did is that, I think, that made it successful over time, right, even though I guess I underestimated it initially, right, is that it was a little bit easier to make games in than some of the other engines in terms of, like, its user interface, right, what language.

91
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,254
Speaker 0: You could write games in JavaScript, right?

92
00:05:53,295 --> 00:05:53,940
Speaker 0: You can't do that.

93
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:55,907
Speaker 1: Not anymore, thankfully.

94
00:05:56,027 --> 00:05:57,313
Speaker 1: Thankfully, they got past that.

95
00:05:57,373 --> 00:05:58,800
Speaker 1: Even in the early days, that was a problem.

96
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:01,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, you could do it, right?

97
00:06:01,605 --> 00:06:07,917
Speaker 0: And it's like, that makes, you know, getting from zero to something easier than being forced to write a game in C#, C++, whatever, right?

98
00:06:10,061 --> 00:06:11,944
Speaker 0: And not being a professional programmer.

99
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:19,780
Speaker 0: And the other thing is that the Unity engine was pretty good at, like, being able to deploy a game to multiple platforms.

100
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:33,077
Speaker 0: Like, develop once, and then you've got a web game that runs in, like, this browser plug-in thing, and you've got your game can run on a PlayStation or a PC or whatever, even though you only developed one game, you don't have to do as much work.

101
00:06:33,538 --> 00:06:35,340
Speaker 0: cross-platform porting, right?

102
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:43,340
Speaker 0: Whereas, you know, if you make some PC game and you want to release it on other platforms, you got to hire some other studio to make ports, right, in the classical model.

103
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:48,800
Speaker 0: So those made it quite successful, plus I think their licensing model also, right?

104
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:52,680
Speaker 1: Well, the licensing model of basically, it's free until you're making, like, real money.

105
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,221
Speaker 0: Exactly, right?

106
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:58,969
Speaker 0: So the Unreal engines of the world were not as good at that part, right?

107
00:06:59,009 --> 00:07:03,096
Speaker 0: So, over time, Unity became quite a successful frickin' thing, right?

108
00:07:03,136 --> 00:07:05,580
Speaker 0: It's like, it's one of the big game engines now, it's for real.

109
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:22,560
Speaker 1: I'd say it's pretty much, it's the number two, like, big studios with money and resources, but there's a lot of reasons why they will prefer Unreal, but Unity is- You can make iPhone games, you can make Android games, everything, you know, it's like, damn.

110
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:31,480
Speaker 1: But basically, what's been happening in the news lately, and the reason Unity's been in the news so much, is the game engine is actually working fine, like, there's nothing particularly wrong with it, but-

111
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:38,219
Speaker 0: I mean, it has some issues, but it's not, you know, it's still in an okay spot, relatively speaking, it's-

112
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:44,860
Speaker 1: Well, you know what, it's the second tier game engine, like, it's a little jankier than Unreal in a lot of ways.

113
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:46,581
Speaker 1: People

114
00:07:46,641 --> 00:07:59,320
Speaker 0: I know who are like, you know, I see them tweeting, because they work with Unity all the time, it's like, they have a lot of complaints with it, you know, and the way it works and such, but it's like, it still works, it's just, you know, it's just got issues, right?

115
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,079
Speaker 1: Yep, but basically- Technical issues.

116
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:05,359
Speaker 1: What's been going on with Unity right now, the reason it's been in the news so much-

117
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:06,301
Speaker 0: Stock's

118
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:27,520
Speaker 1: been all over the place, is that, and I'm super generalizing, just so we can get past this news, we got a lot more to talk about, but basically, they really make their money, like, what Unity makes money with is monetizing shitware games, and helping the people who make those games monetize them with ads, you know, the way most games make money.

119
00:08:28,540 --> 00:08:42,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, 'cause, you know, you make, when your game gets a lot of money, then you owe Unity money, and therefore, they help you make your game make a lot of money, and the way to do that is to make, you know, some microtransaction bullshit.

120
00:08:43,000 --> 00:09:07,240
Speaker 1: And for a bunch of reasons, this doesn't look like it's been going well lately, this has not been working out for them that well, they're not generating the shareholder value that the stock market expects them to generate, there's a lot going on, so their stock's been all over the place, up and down on this whole, like, situation with them, and a company that's pretty dodgy, AppLovin, tried to buy Unity.

121
00:09:08,061 --> 00:09:14,120
Speaker 0: First, the iron source, they were trying to merge with iron source, which was a dodgy company that was, like, distributing malware.

122
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, they definitely used to, I don't know if they still do, but they used to just make malware.

123
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:32,140
Speaker 1: So, they were gonna buy iron source and merge with it, independently, AppLovin tried to buy them, and it looks like, as of today, Unity has rejected this offer, and they're gonna go forward.

124
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:38,819
Speaker 0: The board recommended the shareholders vote against, but the shareholders could vote for, they didn't vote yet.

125
00:09:40,741 --> 00:09:43,399
Speaker 0: But the board says no, which usually means it'll be a no.

126
00:09:44,641 --> 00:09:52,440
Speaker 1: Yep, AppLovin offered to buy it for a premium over the current stock price, which is a relatively low stock price compared to where it's been historically.

127
00:09:53,241 --> 00:10:00,760
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on here, and I think the meta story, the details of what's happening with Unity here aren't that important.

128
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:17,360
Speaker 1: I think what's important is that this entire, the number two game engine, like, the one that almost everyone you interact with is gonna use to make a game, really has no way to make money except via shitware monetization, just like everything else in the gaming industry right now.

129
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:23,280
Speaker 0: The games that people make with it make money this way, so therefore the engine has to make money that same way.

130
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:38,180
Speaker 0: What the AppLovin company does, as far as I can tell, is you make software, and you wanna make some money with bullshit microtransactions, and basically, you just pay them, and they take a cut and help you out with that.

131
00:10:39,581 --> 00:10:48,440
Speaker 0: All you gotta do is make some app, and it's like, well, I made an app, but I didn't build in anything into the app to make any money, right, like selling coins or whatever.

132
00:10:49,360 --> 00:11:02,720
Speaker 0: Hey, AppLovin, yeah, here's my app, you publish it and make money with it, and then you take a cut, okay, and they just do that, unlike, that's what normal publishers do, but traditional publishers do the same thing.

133
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,040
Speaker 0: But AppLovin will basically do it for anybody, as opposed to, you know, being picky and choosy like normal publishers.

134
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:25,560
Speaker 1: And it really, like, poking through their website, like AppLovin, it is very much, like, it's not a scam, it is just the skeeviest, like, this is what is underpinning a lot of the games industry and a lot of the app world right now.

135
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:29,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had never heard of AppLovin before this, and they're way bigger than I ever imagined.

136
00:11:30,681 --> 00:11:44,940
Speaker 1: Well, because people think that, like, these AAA games make all the money, but no, the games that make all the money are, like, absolute bottom tier princess tooth falling out with ads and gotcha, that kind of nonsense, like, that is how you make money.

137
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:45,380
Speaker 1: Those

138
00:11:45,420 --> 00:12:06,580
Speaker 0: games, yeah, those games cause nothing to make and bring in some hefty pile of, you know, gambling money, right, whereas the AAA games cost a fortune to make, and they bring in maybe slightly more than a fortune, right, but, you know, it's not as good a deal as making, if you spent all of the money you spent on the AAA game making garbage games, you'd get a much bigger ROI.

139
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:18,820
Speaker 1: But I guess if you are a game enthusiast, you're trying to make games, you're interested in games, do not, I would not read into all of this as a reason to not use Unity as an engine itself.

140
00:12:20,563 --> 00:12:21,818
Speaker 0: Especially if you don't have to pay for it?

141
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:22,541
Speaker 1: Exactly.

142
00:12:22,782 --> 00:12:28,575
Speaker 1: Like, Unity is still a fine engine, and I expect that the company will continue to invest in it enough to make it succeed.

143
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:30,680
Speaker 1: It does have problems, but it works pretty well.

144
00:12:31,261 --> 00:12:40,980
Speaker 1: This situation, I don't know where this is going, I don't know how it gets resolved, I don't really know what the future of game monetization is going to be, but it can't be what it is now.

145
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:56,440
Speaker 1: But I'm hoping this is a sideshow, because I do think one of the big futures that Unity could have is the same thing that Unreal has, where another big driver of these game engines being developed is to do things like how they made The Mandalorian.

146
00:12:56,781 --> 00:13:05,060
Speaker 1: To make volumes and video walls for in-camera effects and real-time effects, basically replacing what we use green screens for today in a lot of productions.

147
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:12,014
Speaker 1: I always envisioned that, especially when Unity bought Weta, they got a better render pipeline they're going to incorporate in for higher quality.

148
00:13:12,796 --> 00:13:14,540
Speaker 1: Not so much for games, but for things like that.

149
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:23,860
Speaker 1: I could see a world where big time movie and TV studios use some sort of Unreal technology to produce their television and do their effects.

150
00:13:24,801 --> 00:13:32,120
Speaker 1: And the smaller tier, like B-tier shows, use a cheaper solution using Unity and a bunch of their stuff to do it instead.

151
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:42,720
Speaker 0: I see a world, no no no, we're clearly heading to a world where someone goes to make a TV show using Unity, and then the TV show has microtransactions.

152
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:54,040
Speaker 1: I mean, really, we're heading toward a world where the temperature is so high that there's no humans left, and the last app gets its last monetization hit.

153
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,720
Speaker 0: No one can play any games on their phone because their phones just overheat.

154
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:09,360
Speaker 1: It's like that terrifying cartoon everyone saw as a kid, where the World War I, the animals take over after the last two humans die in World War I, but the last two humans were just playing some app game, Princess Teeth Fallout.

155
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,264
Speaker 1: So, some other news.

156
00:14:13,825 --> 00:14:18,857
Speaker 1: Two games are really having a big profile in the online discussion lately.

157
00:14:18,897 --> 00:14:20,200
Speaker 1: We've not played either of them yet.

158
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:31,480
Speaker 1: But there's Cult of the Lamb, which has had a big buzz for a while, but the marketing blitz around this game seems to have just stepped up like crazy.

159
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:40,480
Speaker 1: And then there's multiverses, which I am deeply suspicious of, for reasons we'll get into.

160
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,752
Speaker 0: So these two games are just the hot games right now.

161
00:14:43,812 --> 00:14:45,520
Speaker 0: They're so hot right now, oh my god, right?

162
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:51,820
Speaker 0: So the Cult of the Lamb game appears to be some combination of Animal Crossing, but also twin stick shooting, maybe?

163
00:14:54,402 --> 00:15:00,940
Speaker 0: But the styling of it is very dark, spooky, you're running a creepy cult kind of deal.

164
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,710
Speaker 0: So that's what I've heard about it.

165
00:15:05,673 --> 00:15:08,060
Speaker 0: I might try it, depends on how much it costs, right?

166
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:14,460
Speaker 0: But yeah, build a town, but also try to succeed, unlike Animal Crossing where you can't fail.

167
00:15:15,921 --> 00:15:26,700
Speaker 0: And the multiverses is just Smash Brothers, except you have Warner Brothers Cartoon Network characters and Lebron James as one of the characters as well.

168
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:27,948
Speaker 0: So it's a little bit of Space Jam.

169
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:34,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's interesting, my suspicions, I'll play multiverses, this is free, I don't want to be able to talk about it.

170
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,317
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, right?

171
00:15:37,621 --> 00:15:45,140
Speaker 1: This is the kind of game that your friend whose uncle "worked at Nintendo" would make up having played on a Neo Geo.

172
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:50,120
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, Shaq-Fu was its own game, we didn't fix in the Shaq-Fu with the other.

173
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,980
Speaker 1: Shaq-Fu versus Mortal Kombat.

174
00:15:54,740 --> 00:16:02,060
Speaker 0: I mean, a lot of people have attempted to make Smash clones with varying levels of success, none of them remotely close to actual Smash Brothers.

175
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:10,120
Speaker 0: But this one is A, free to play, and B, it seems to be going down the Fortnite road.

176
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:13,533
Speaker 0: It's like, this looks like Fortnite Smash Brothers, and you know what?

177
00:16:13,935 --> 00:16:15,180
Speaker 0: That could succeed, right?

178
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:23,740
Speaker 0: Because Fortnite was really just, you know, accessible change business model version of PUBG, which is a more serious game.

179
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:30,660
Speaker 1: But also better game design aimed at players having fun instead of competition, there's a lot going on there.

180
00:16:31,362 --> 00:16:37,380
Speaker 0: I think Smash, you know, the difference between Smash and PUBG is that PUBG is intended to be what it is.

181
00:16:38,382 --> 00:16:40,920
Speaker 0: Smash is sort of accidentally hardcore.

182
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:46,759
Speaker 1: Yeah, Smash was not intended to be a game that people have serious esports competitions in.

183
00:16:47,360 --> 00:17:03,340
Speaker 0: Right, it's like because the people who make Smash are not taking the competitive people into account, there just ends up being, right, this sort of competitive way to play it, that sort of incidental, accidental, right, that's there.

184
00:17:04,080 --> 00:17:13,180
Speaker 0: Which is like, you know, if anyone is actually trying, you know, it's like if anyone is actually trying to play competitively, well then it's no longer a fun, silly game, right?

185
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:19,060
Speaker 0: But if those people didn't exist, Smash Brothers would just be a fun, you know, a fun whatever game.

186
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:23,079
Speaker 0: Multiverses, I don't know if they're trying to make it competitive or serious or not, right?

187
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:35,820
Speaker 1: I highly doubt it because I feel like this is the kind of game that is going to go primarily on, it's free with whatever microtransactions and stuff they do, just like Fortnite does to get kids to pay money.

188
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:45,380
Speaker 1: Coupled with, kids will be invested in the intellectual property of, like whatever, like during the Steven Universe, they can play as Steven Universe and have them fight Superman.

189
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:46,801
Speaker 0: Yup.

190
00:17:47,782 --> 00:18:01,920
Speaker 0: And somehow Superman doesn't just win, it's like, I know Steven Universe has a lot of powers, but it's like, Superman, unless Steven Universe has a kryptonite gem in his stomach, one punch and he's going to be, you know, Gibbs everywhere, right?

191
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:20,278
Speaker 1: Well we'll see, because on one hand, I am just generally, I am deeply suspicious of any game that is free to play, that is not necessarily bad, but it is often a warning sign, because game has to make its money somehow, and if you're not paying money, they're getting money from you.

192
00:18:20,578 --> 00:18:21,960
Speaker 1: somehow, you gotta think about that.

193
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:26,880
Speaker 0: But that's it, incorporating intellectual properties has been a help for Fortnite, right?

194
00:18:27,381 --> 00:18:28,358
Speaker 1: Oh it absolutely has.

195
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:34,729
Speaker 0: If they, unlike, you know, Smash kept adding characters, adding characters, but eventually it's like, okay, we're done, right?

196
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:41,660
Speaker 0: I think Multiverse has an opportunity to basically not end, because it's not some, you know, it's not a Nintendo game.

197
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:54,280
Speaker 1: Well it can be like a MOBA, but coupled with, you know, what Fortnite does with Seasons, and like, oh, an event is happening, ten new characters just appeared, you can play them, just this month, and then they're going to go away, like all sorts of nonsense like that can happen.

198
00:18:54,280 --> 00:19:00,347
Speaker 0: If they get enough money, if they sort of hit the critical money level, they're just going to keep this thing alive, right?

199
00:19:00,407 --> 00:19:12,500
Speaker 0: It's going to keep going, and keep getting updates, and keep modifying, and it has some potential to succeed in a capitalism way, that the other Smash-a-likes have not.

200
00:19:13,041 --> 00:19:13,301
Speaker 1: Yep.

201
00:19:13,742 --> 00:19:22,959
Speaker 1: Oh man, so one of the listeners actually played some Multiverses, and they're implying that the monetization is "scummy as

202
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:23,360
Speaker 1: fuck."

203
00:19:24,241 --> 00:19:25,025
Speaker 1: You don't say,

204
00:19:26,031 --> 00:19:26,776
Speaker 1: "Pikachu.jpg.".

205
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:27,781
Speaker 1: Yep.

206
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:33,740
Speaker 1: Because it's free to play, like, I am more than willing to play it enough so we can do a real review of it at some point.

207
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:37,159
Speaker 0: I will play it for zero dollars, and then uninstall it.

208
00:19:37,381 --> 00:19:41,960
Speaker 1: It finally, it just released for real yesterday, up until this point it was only in an open beta.

209
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's why it's so hot right now.

210
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:44,540
Speaker 0: Yep.

211
00:19:45,001 --> 00:20:05,640
Speaker 1: So, we'll see, we'll play it, we'll do a review of it, we'll see if there's something going on here, but for me to play it beyond what it'll take to do a review, it would have to be more fun than Smash, because the one thing about platform fighters like this is that I have personally never found them fun unless I am playing in the same room as the other people.

212
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,903
Speaker 1: Like, that is where the magic is.

213
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:19,740
Speaker 1: in a game like this, and at least for me, like, playing Smash online always felt kind of weird and hollow, kind of like playing fighting games online, unless I knew who I was playing with directly and I was friends with them, I always felt a little, like, not as fun.

214
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:24,240
Speaker 0: That's true, but, you know, Nintendo's really bad at the real-time online game.

215
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:28,780
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, so there's no way to play Smash online, or even in person with multiple Switches, effectively.

216
00:20:29,101 --> 00:20:36,440
Speaker 0: But, but, the multiverses might not have that problem, because it's like, you know, a PC game, like, it might, the online play might actually be decent.

217
00:20:37,181 --> 00:20:39,260
Speaker 0: You know, low enough, enough latency, who knows?

218
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:48,480
Speaker 0: But I would suspect they are definitely planning to absolutely cram this thing with characters, because- As long as they keep making money, I think, yeah, they're just gonna keep it going.

219
00:20:48,620 --> 00:21:02,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, especially because they have defined classes, like, there's five classes of characters that'll have similar movesets, and every character also has a horizontal, vertical, or hybrid, I guess, directionality, like, what way do they like to fight?

220
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:11,380
Speaker 1: So, I bet we're gonna see, like, 50 characters that all are basically the same, but are just the different skins.

221
00:21:12,361 --> 00:21:14,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll be, you know, crook slightly so.

222
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:17,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see, we'll play it, we'll do a review of it.

223
00:21:17,562 --> 00:21:19,059
Speaker 1: Cult of the Lamb, I expect I'll play too.

224
00:21:19,661 --> 00:21:25,820
Speaker 0: I still really want to see a fighting game where, you know, it's asymmetrical on purpose, right?

225
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:32,360
Speaker 0: And it's like, you know, even the One Punch Man game, it's like they balanced it out, because Saitama takes forever to show up, right?

226
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:36,377
Speaker 0: That matches the canon of the manga, right?

227
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:37,000
Speaker 0: Anime.

228
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:43,660
Speaker 0: But, like, give me the Superman who punches, and most opponents just explode, right?

229
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:46,765
Speaker 0: But what do you get into that game?

230
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,269
Speaker 1: You play what, everyone's Superman?

231
00:21:48,329 --> 00:21:52,140
Speaker 1: It's just Superman punching invincible Superman forever?

232
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:55,834
Speaker 0: Well, no, because there'll be, you gotta make it make sense, right?

233
00:21:55,854 --> 00:21:57,180
Speaker 0: There'll be a Batman with kryptonite.

234
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,025
Speaker 0: It's like, okay, so I'll pick Batman.

235
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:04,120
Speaker 0: Okay, well, now I'll pick someone who's stronger than Batman, not as strong as Superman, right?

236
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,673
Speaker 0: It's like Wonder Woman's gonna be Batman, she actually has powers, right?

237
00:22:06,693 --> 00:22:08,020
Speaker 0: And she doesn't give a shit about kryptonite.

238
00:22:08,441 --> 00:22:11,531
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, so you can mix it up in that way, right?

239
00:22:11,551 --> 00:22:14,160
Speaker 0: So there's a little bit of rock-paper-scissors going on, right?

240
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:20,020
Speaker 0: And plus, you can throw some other god-tier characters, there's people who are stronger than Superman, right?

241
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,631
Speaker 0: Let's see, Superman can't catch the Flash, right?

242
00:22:22,651 --> 00:22:24,279
Speaker 0: Flash can just run away till time runs out.

243
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:28,520
Speaker 0: And I've only used DC characters so far.

244
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,233
Speaker 1: Make it versus FPS, it's just Superman versus the Flash.

245
00:22:32,117 --> 00:22:32,439
Speaker 1: That's it.

246
00:22:34,821 --> 00:22:40,120
Speaker 1: One of you is running around like Doomguy trying not to get punched, and one of you is Superman just trying to punch the Flash even once.

247
00:22:40,561 --> 00:22:41,100
Speaker 0: And that's the entire game.

248
00:22:41,301 --> 00:22:44,140
Speaker 0: Plus, it would be fun to play such a game with random characters.

249
00:22:46,711 --> 00:22:46,900
Speaker 0: Anyway.

250
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:47,460
Speaker 1: Yep.

251
00:22:47,801 --> 00:22:48,842
Speaker 1: So, some other news.

252
00:22:50,124 --> 00:23:02,200
Speaker 1: There have been, of course, a huge number of sexual harassment and racism and other cases in a ton of different video game studios, as happens, as is the open, known thing.

253
00:23:02,441 --> 00:23:08,220
Speaker 0: There's been sexual harassment and racism everywhere on Earth that humans have been for millennia.

254
00:23:08,761 --> 00:23:11,280
Speaker 0: But games- Including video game studios.

255
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,140
Speaker 1: But video game studios definitely have a higher than average concentration of it for a lot of reasons.

256
00:23:18,201 --> 00:23:23,480
Speaker 1: But a lot of nerds like to act as though Nintendo is somehow exempt from this or immune to this.

257
00:23:24,141 --> 00:23:37,880
Speaker 1: And there is a story breaking today, at noon, talking about a huge and terrifying amount of sexual harassment that Nintendo of America's QA testers face.

258
00:23:39,601 --> 00:23:44,720
Speaker 1: Nintendo of America seems to have a big problem, and this article goes into extreme detail.

259
00:23:46,464 --> 00:23:51,120
Speaker 1: And you should read the entire article because there's a lot going on here, there's way too much to summarize.

260
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:58,453
Speaker 1: But, uh, in the first paragraph, you will go from, "That doesn't seem as bad as I expected to.

261
00:23:58,513 --> 00:24:01,598
Speaker 1: That is way worse than I expected in the span of, like, two

262
00:24:01,638 --> 00:24:02,099
Speaker 1: sentences.".

263
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:02,921
Speaker 0: Yeah.

264
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:09,420
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, these companies, right, Nintendo specifically, right, is one of those companies where everything is so secret and hidden, right?

265
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:15,978
Speaker 0: It's like, so, if there's bad- that hides the good shit that we want them to tell us, like, "Hey, what the fuck is going on with Metroid Prime

266
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:16,801
Speaker 0: 4?".

267
00:24:16,801 --> 00:24:19,980
Speaker 0: And it also hides the bad shit, like, we're mistreating all our employees.

268
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:20,460
Speaker 0: Yup.

269
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:29,580
Speaker 0: So, um, but I think that's- you can see, though, that, you know, the people in Japan, right, they're keeping the lips tight, right?

270
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:37,740
Speaker 0: And the people in America, right, I don't know how people know this, but you can read about this, Nintendo of America sort of had these two levels of employees.

271
00:24:37,840 --> 00:24:43,020
Speaker 0: There's, like, the real employees and sort of, like, the second class of, like, contractor, not real employees.

272
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:47,460
Speaker 0: They'll have, like, different colored cards and they can't eat at, like, the Cafe Mario.

273
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:47,545
Speaker 0: Yeah.

274
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:55,020
Speaker 0: So, it's, like, they're sort of, like, second class citizens, even though, in many cases, they're working full time for Nintendo, no one else, right?

275
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,360
Speaker 0: But they're just not- technically not full employees, they don't get the same benefits, right?

276
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:02,620
Speaker 1: Yup, if you've never encountered this, it is super common in every industry.

277
00:25:03,645 --> 00:25:03,732
Speaker 0: Yeah.

278
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:16,080
Speaker 0: But, you know, the people who are- who have the good card, right, the real employees, quote, "real," right, they're not- even if bad shit's happening, there's a strong pressure incentive for them not to say anything, right?

279
00:25:17,381 --> 00:25:26,080
Speaker 0: And then, a lot of the people who aren't, they want to become, right, the other, you know, they want to upgrade, so a lot of them will keep their mouths shut.

280
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,665
Speaker 0: It's only down in the QA department, right?

281
00:25:29,725 --> 00:25:36,180
Speaker 0: That's where, right, it's, like, far away from power, the loyalty decreases, right?

282
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:47,120
Speaker 0: You know, the- you know, it's, like, they know they're not going anywhere, they're just coming there to test some game, you know, they're not- The QA people in internal America aren't even testing the game, they're testing the localization of the game, right?

283
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:59,220
Speaker 0: So, it's, like, they're way down, and they're, you know, A, more likely to be mistreated, and B, more likely to report the mistreatment due to, like, what do I- what do I have to lose, right?

284
00:25:59,607 --> 00:25:59,820
Speaker 1: Yup.

285
00:26:00,481 --> 00:26:17,880
Speaker 0: And, of course, that's what happened, but, you know, the fact that it's- that culture, right, of any company comes from the top, so the fact that it's happening down there makes it very suspicious and/or likely that it's actually, you know, part of the culture throughout.

286
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:28,080
Speaker 0: It's just the, you know, the structure of things is going to make it very difficult for any of the problems anywhere else in the organization higher up to ever be revealed.

287
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:28,701
Speaker 1: Yup.

288
00:26:29,101 --> 00:26:43,160
Speaker 1: And an interesting sort of sidebar here is that part of where all this harassment is happening, and it's not just Nintendo, but this is a good story to highlight it, it's in the unmoderated collaboration spaces within large companies.

289
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:44,480
Speaker 1: A

290
00:26:44,581 --> 00:26:45,041
Speaker 0: lot of

291
00:26:46,003 --> 00:27:16,716
Speaker 1: the less obvious sexual harassment isn't in person, and with remote work, obviously, that's driven that too, but, like, in person, that's a- it's a different form of harassment, it's responded to in different ways, companies tend to have more policies around dealing with it when it comes to light, but there is this sea of basically unmoderated chat rooms and bulletin boards and systems inside of big companies where this stuff happens, and companies don't seem to have, like, internal moderators.

292
00:27:16,776 --> 00:27:24,644
Speaker 1: Like, very rarely are there internal moderators, like- Because if you're a company, right?

293
00:27:24,724 --> 00:27:26,967
Speaker 0: Let's say you have a Slack and it's really big, right?

294
00:27:27,087 --> 00:27:28,209
Speaker 0: And you can't monitor it all.

295
00:27:28,229 --> 00:27:32,435
Speaker 0: Okay, so you hire a moderator whose full-time job is to moderate your internal Slack, right?

296
00:27:32,756 --> 00:27:34,619
Speaker 0: And what does that person do?

297
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:39,220
Speaker 1: First of all- One, that person in a just company should have firing power.

298
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:44,168
Speaker 0: Right, but that person, A, costs you money to hire, they're an employee, right?

299
00:27:44,388 --> 00:27:45,811
Speaker 0: And do they make you any money?

300
00:27:45,871 --> 00:27:50,640
Speaker 0: No, they cost you money because all they do is get employees fired and you have to hire a newbie.

301
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:59,895
Speaker 1: Arguably though, they would make you money because they would fire the shitty toxic employees, thus making your company more successful and be able to retain better talent.

302
00:28:00,095 --> 00:28:03,220
Speaker 1: You also would stop driving away good people, but nobody makes that calculation.

303
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:08,051
Speaker 0: That's too forward-thinking for capitalists.

304
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:11,320
Speaker 0: That's also long-term thinking that capitalists don't have, right?

305
00:28:11,761 --> 00:28:15,866
Speaker 1: Yep, so this article gets into a lot of details, and you should read the entire thing.

306
00:28:15,946 --> 00:28:19,130
Speaker 1: It's going to teach you about what's going on in these unmoderated spaces.

307
00:28:19,390 --> 00:28:26,960
Speaker 1: It's going to teach you how Nintendo is not really better at this than other companies, especially when it comes to sexual discrimination and sexual harassment.

308
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:40,412
Speaker 1: It's going to take you through this whole unfair ecosystem of contractors who work full-time for big companies via other companies that hire them out, which is largely predatory and unsustainable.

309
00:28:40,452 --> 00:28:42,013
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on here.

310
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:47,177
Speaker 1: This article is extremely well-researched and there's really nothing else.

311
00:28:47,237 --> 00:28:50,260
Speaker 1: I can say that you're not going to get out of this article, at least I hope you'll get out of the article.

312
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,103
Speaker 1: Let's move on to conventions.

313
00:28:53,203 --> 00:29:07,160
Speaker 1: So, big news, Gen Con is in one of the terrifying states in America that is banning abortion and going crazy as the Cold Civil War continues to escalate and the laws start to radically diverge between red states and blue states here.

314
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:10,483
Speaker 1: And now Gen Con is in a tough situation.

315
00:29:10,503 --> 00:29:22,380
Speaker 1: They are in a dangerous red state that's passed terrible laws, and now they're at a point where vendors and attendees are boycotting them over this because they don't want to travel to the state anymore.

316
00:29:23,522 --> 00:29:26,575
Speaker 0: And their contract has four years left, I believe?

317
00:29:26,856 --> 00:29:27,620
Speaker 0: Some number of years?

318
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,819
Speaker 1: That's what I think I read.

319
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:43,720
Speaker 0: So they can't, I don't know what the contract says, but it probably, my guess, based on what other conventions' contracts say, is that they have to run some event in that convention center for X years, and if they don't, they have to pay some kind of penalty.

320
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:50,366
Speaker 0: And it may or may not say they can't run any other event competing somewhere else,

321
00:29:50,626 --> 00:29:50,806
Speaker 1: but

322
00:29:52,107 --> 00:30:06,760
Speaker 0: they're kind of in a tight spot to where it's like, do they stay, which is bad, or there's no good answer for them, because staying is bad and leaving might just be the end.

323
00:30:08,661 --> 00:30:08,862
Speaker 1: Yep.

324
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:17,636
Speaker 1: They're going to have to do something, though, because I want to say Lone Shark Games was the first bigger name to come out and say, "We're never coming back again.

325
00:30:17,676 --> 00:30:20,059
Speaker 1: We will not interact with Indiana full

326
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:20,360
Speaker 1: stop.".

327
00:30:20,761 --> 00:30:29,260
Speaker 1: And a few other companies have come out and said this since then, and this is an open, ongoing conversation right now, and we're going to have to see where this goes.

328
00:30:30,381 --> 00:30:44,240
Speaker 1: I could definitely foresee, unless somehow the US government takes action to stop red states from passing these kinds of laws, I think we're going to see the flight of companies and conventions from basically every red state over time.

329
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:45,262
Speaker 1: It's going to happen quickly.

330
00:30:45,282 --> 00:30:51,817
Speaker 1: This is going to happen over the course of a decade, and nerd conventions are really only going to be in blue states.

331
00:30:52,137 --> 00:30:53,300
Speaker 1: I think that's where this is going.

332
00:30:53,700 --> 00:31:01,200
Speaker 1: And the ones that stay in red states, I hope this doesn't happen, but I suspect it'll be a lot like Anime Matsuri, like the bad ones will stay.

333
00:31:02,742 --> 00:31:13,860
Speaker 0: There are still people who will run things there, but I think a lot of it's like you look at, say, before the red states really went over the cliff in the past decade or two.

334
00:31:15,641 --> 00:31:16,783
Speaker 0: There were a lot of countries.

335
00:31:16,843 --> 00:31:22,752
Speaker 0: It's like you wouldn't run a game con in North Korea unless you were North Korean.

336
00:31:23,193 --> 00:31:27,600
Speaker 0: It's like you wouldn't run, what other country's evil?

337
00:31:28,842 --> 00:31:30,685
Speaker 0: You get Saudi Arabia.

338
00:31:31,145 --> 00:31:37,155
Speaker 0: Saudi Arabian people might run a game con in Saudi Arabia, but no one else is going to.

339
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:40,540
Speaker 0: Especially people who believe in women's rights and such.

340
00:31:41,361 --> 00:31:42,705
Speaker 1: There's the line of sanctions.

341
00:31:42,766 --> 00:31:47,280
Speaker 1: Like right now, we live in a country that is sanctioning Russia because it invaded a neighbor.

342
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:47,721
Speaker 1: Right.

343
00:31:48,241 --> 00:32:03,840
Speaker 0: It's like even though the people there, some of the people there, but even though many of the people there actually are Saudi Arabia, there's probably tons of nerds who are perfectly chill and are not evil or they don't support what their government's doing in any way.

344
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:07,911
Speaker 0: Just like all the nerds who live in red states and don't support what the government's doing in any way.

345
00:32:07,931 --> 00:32:08,773
Speaker 0: That's just where they live.

346
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:11,560
Speaker 0: And they deserve and want a convention.

347
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:20,287
Speaker 0: But anyone who's not from there, right, it's like doesn't want to take money from the place that they are.

348
00:32:20,748 --> 00:32:33,840
Speaker 0: That's not an evil place and send it to a, you know, even though many of the citizens, you know, are perfectly good or even most, it's like you're still helping out these, you know, the powerful evil people.

349
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,084
Speaker 1: Well, even worse, because in America.

350
00:32:36,105 --> 00:32:43,720
Speaker 0: And there's sort of this line, right, the line is basically does that place like violate the human rights of the people in the place?

351
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,899
Speaker 1: I would say the abortion ban specifically has crossed that line directly and permanently.

352
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:54,245
Speaker 0: I mean, some of the gun action that was going on also crossed the line.

353
00:33:04,821 --> 00:33:12,120
Speaker 0: It's like the gun stuff was like on the line and then they made it worse and that crossed the line and then the abortion stuff went even further over the line off the cliff.

354
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:18,120
Speaker 1: Because there is the argument people will make that, you know, if you move these events away from these states, you hurt the good people there.

355
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:26,540
Speaker 1: But at the same time, by holding the event there, you are voting with your dollars that the government of that state should continue doing what it's doing.

356
00:33:27,481 --> 00:33:29,700
Speaker 1: That there are no consequences for making these decisions.

357
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:30,961
Speaker 0: Yeah.

358
00:33:30,981 --> 00:33:34,389
Speaker 0: I mean, if you when you engage in, you know, if it's a capitalist society.

359
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:34,850
Speaker 0: Right.

360
00:33:34,930 --> 00:33:38,659
Speaker 0: So it's like, OK, first of all, if you don't if we still have the capitalism.

361
00:33:38,679 --> 00:33:38,960
Speaker 0: Right.

362
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,584
Speaker 0: It's like, yes, you want to destroy it.

363
00:33:40,966 --> 00:33:45,659
Speaker 0: But if it's still there, then until it's destroyed, you still have to play that game.

364
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,584
Speaker 1: I mean, you could do red line.

365
00:33:47,624 --> 00:33:49,429
Speaker 1: Like, how did I summarize the plot of red line?

366
00:33:49,750 --> 00:33:53,580
Speaker 1: Imagine if North Korea hated more than anything else in the world.

367
00:33:54,181 --> 00:33:57,105
Speaker 1: Not the situation in South Korea, not not with America.

368
00:33:57,385 --> 00:34:07,660
Speaker 1: If North Korea hated car racing and that was the entire society was built around hating car racing and we chose to host F1 in North Korea without their permission.

369
00:34:08,321 --> 00:34:20,179
Speaker 1: If you could somehow host a subversive Gen Con in Indiana, where the state of Indiana got no money from it whatsoever and it actively undermined the government, that would be a way to proceed.

370
00:34:20,581 --> 00:34:22,706
Speaker 1: But I don't think that's possible under capitalism.

371
00:34:22,746 --> 00:34:28,840
Speaker 0: As long as you're still as long as the game of capitalism is still the game that is being played, as much as you want to end that game.

372
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:29,440
Speaker 0: Right.

373
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:30,583
Speaker 0: We're still playing it.

374
00:34:30,703 --> 00:34:34,431
Speaker 0: Therefore, in playing it, don't give your points.

375
00:34:34,532 --> 00:34:36,176
Speaker 0: Don't let the bad guys score points.

376
00:34:36,697 --> 00:34:37,739
Speaker 0: It's like, don't help.

377
00:34:39,801 --> 00:34:47,516
Speaker 1: How many times have we played a board game and Scott is like, if you go there, you'll get X points and rim will get real Y points and rim will win.

378
00:34:47,817 --> 00:34:49,159
Speaker 1: And how often do they just do it anyway?

379
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:50,280
Speaker 0: Right.

380
00:34:50,641 --> 00:34:58,497
Speaker 0: So in the real world, it's like do what you can to prevent the bad guys from scoring points as long as the game is the game it is.

381
00:34:59,419 --> 00:34:59,900
Speaker 0: Don't do that.

382
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:04,025
Speaker 1: And if you if you're another argument I've seen is that it wouldn't be enough to matter.

383
00:35:04,045 --> 00:35:05,607
Speaker 1: I just point out this.

384
00:35:06,188 --> 00:35:16,020
Speaker 1: Gen Con alone accounts for 10 percent of all of the economic impact in the state of Indiana from events hosted there.

385
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:18,322
Speaker 0: Ten percent.

386
00:35:18,362 --> 00:35:20,546
Speaker 0: That includes, right?

387
00:35:20,646 --> 00:35:22,810
Speaker 0: All of the performance racing events.

388
00:35:23,111 --> 00:35:24,754
Speaker 1: The National FFA Convention.

389
00:35:24,974 --> 00:35:26,457
Speaker 1: The FDIC International.

390
00:35:26,517 --> 00:35:28,260
Speaker 1: I'm on a website that lists the top events.

391
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,383
Speaker 0: How many Indianapolis Colts games?

392
00:35:32,125 --> 00:35:34,488
Speaker 0: The Indy 500.

393
00:35:34,488 --> 00:35:39,335
Speaker 0: And how many concerts are played in Indianapolis in the stadium?

394
00:35:39,535 --> 00:35:41,418
Speaker 0: How many people stop there on their tours?

395
00:35:41,899 --> 00:35:42,860
Speaker 0: Big time musicians?

396
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:45,243
Speaker 1: Because it's a first follower situation.

397
00:35:45,604 --> 00:35:50,250
Speaker 1: If Gen Con leaves Indiana, other events will also start to leave Indiana.

398
00:35:53,815 --> 00:35:54,876
Speaker 1: And we'll see what happens.

399
00:35:54,936 --> 00:35:57,800
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, TwitchCon actually did something really good.

400
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:01,420
Speaker 0: Well, they undid something bad.

401
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:10,692
Speaker 1: Well, so first they did what pretty much every convention out there except PAX and MagFest and a handful of others are doing.

402
00:36:11,032 --> 00:36:14,256
Speaker 1: And they gave up on masks because, you know, the entire society gave up on masks.

403
00:36:14,276 --> 00:36:15,598
Speaker 1: The CDC gave up on masks.

404
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:17,280
Speaker 1: Like that ship just sailed.

405
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:20,684
Speaker 1: And TwitchCon basically was like, yep, masks aren't required anymore.

406
00:36:21,165 --> 00:36:28,553
Speaker 1: And there was actually such an outcry from the partners and the attendees and the guests that they backed down.

407
00:36:28,934 --> 00:36:34,140
Speaker 1: They're going to require masks at TwitchCon, which I see as a win.

408
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:38,240
Speaker 0: And they're also going to require vaccine or negative tests.

409
00:36:39,942 --> 00:36:42,786
Speaker 1: I mean, we're in a weird situation because we don't have a new multivalent booster yet.

410
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:54,280
Speaker 1: But the one thing we do know is that the anecdotal data seems to show that mass cons that actually enforce masking have way less COVID afterward than unmasked cons.

411
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:56,698
Speaker 0: Except for some reason PAX East this year.

412
00:36:57,101 --> 00:37:01,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, PAX East didn't have a huge number of cases, from what I can gather.

413
00:37:03,242 --> 00:37:03,819
Speaker 0: It wasn't great.

414
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:04,960
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it wasn't great.

415
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,279
Speaker 0: Someone literally died.

416
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:06,722
Speaker 1: Yep.

417
00:37:07,086 --> 00:37:08,117
Speaker 1: But there's no good stats.

418
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,260
Speaker 0: From COVID that they definitely got at PAX East.

419
00:37:10,581 --> 00:37:13,265
Speaker 1: The problem is there aren't stats to track on this anymore.

420
00:37:13,385 --> 00:37:20,236
Speaker 1: All we have to go on are things like people self-reporting or people like admitting they caught it on social media.

421
00:37:20,256 --> 00:37:22,620
Speaker 1: Like we don't have real data to show.

422
00:37:23,340 --> 00:37:25,705
Speaker 1: All we can base this on is like meta-analysis.

423
00:37:26,045 --> 00:37:33,740
Speaker 1: And the only meta-analysis we've got is that cons that fully require masks definitely seem to have far fewer cases than cons that don't require masks.

424
00:37:34,241 --> 00:37:39,732
Speaker 1: It's all kind of moot because I'm still not going to cons in this environment except in and out to do panels.

425
00:37:39,752 --> 00:37:43,300
Speaker 1: I would definitely not go to TwitchCon regardless of the masking situation.

426
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:44,478
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

427
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:56,918
Speaker 1: But the most fascinating thing to come out of this is that after Twitch made this announcement, there was a counter-backlash from the shitty people who attend TwitchCon who are now, they're saying they're boycotting it.

428
00:37:56,959 --> 00:37:57,579
Speaker 1: Which, frankly...

429
00:37:57,961 --> 00:37:58,387
Speaker 0: Go ahead.

430
00:37:58,408 --> 00:37:59,078
Speaker 0: Bye.

431
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:01,680
Speaker 0: Talk about one of the... That makes the cons safer.

432
00:38:02,061 --> 00:38:07,160
Speaker 1: Talk about one of the fastest and easiest ways to purge a whole bunch of bad people from your convention.

433
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:07,940
Speaker 0: Right.

434
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:08,982
Speaker 0: I mean, that's the real thing.

435
00:38:09,022 --> 00:38:19,897
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the masks, there is evidence to suggest that the quality masks, right, the N95-ish ones, if worn properly, do have, you know, they do decrease transmission, right?

436
00:38:19,937 --> 00:38:21,399
Speaker 0: Which is just common sense.

437
00:38:21,439 --> 00:38:21,800
Speaker 0: Like, yeah.

438
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:33,020
Speaker 0: If things get in to you through your nose and mouth and you physically block them from getting in there with a fine enough filter, it's like, yeah, obviously it works and there's evidence that it works.

439
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:43,256
Speaker 0: But if having some requirement, right, that just filters out bad people, right, that makes life better.

440
00:38:43,356 --> 00:38:46,080
Speaker 0: It's like you don't have to moderate if they self-moderate, right?

441
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:54,420
Speaker 0: It's sort of like, you know, how all the right-wing evil people would be like, ah, we'll make you lick bacon to come in the airport because they're being Islamophobic.

442
00:38:55,544 --> 00:38:57,919
Speaker 1: You have to say the words Black Lives Matter to come in.

443
00:38:58,740 --> 00:38:58,921
Speaker 0: Right.

444
00:38:58,961 --> 00:38:59,281
Speaker 0: Exactly.

445
00:38:59,301 --> 00:39:13,680
Speaker 0: Like, if you had a filter that wasn't going to infringe upon someone's human rights and wasn't discriminatory and unjust, and it really only filtered out people who deserve to be filtered out justly, right?

446
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:17,780
Speaker 0: And not based on some unfair of any prejudice or whatever.

447
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,182
Speaker 0: That's what this is.

448
00:39:20,282 --> 00:39:22,707
Speaker 0: It's like, you've got to wear a mask and have a Vex.

449
00:39:22,787 --> 00:39:30,380
Speaker 0: It's like, anyone who isn't willing to do that is a person who doesn't respect other human beings and their right to live.

450
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,633
Speaker 0: And therefore, if they don't come, good.

451
00:39:34,161 --> 00:39:37,885
Speaker 1: Because right now we're in this liminal period where COVID's not gone.

452
00:39:38,186 --> 00:39:39,407
Speaker 1: It's not fully endemic yet.

453
00:39:39,688 --> 00:39:49,660
Speaker 1: So if cons are going to happen at all in this environment, it seems deeply unethical to have just unmasked conventions during this current environment.

454
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:53,380
Speaker 1: Maybe that'll change with the multivalent vaccine, but we don't have one yet.

455
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,679
Speaker 0: Listen, even forgetting the COVID biz, it's like people are getting all kinds of con plagues all these years.

456
00:39:59,041 --> 00:40:03,760
Speaker 1: If there weren't COVID, I would just never go to cons again if masks were required other than during a pandemic.

457
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,945
Speaker 0: But the point is, is that like, they do work.

458
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:09,730
Speaker 0: We could eliminate all the con plagues, right?

459
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:14,960
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, how many flus and all kinds of other stuff.

460
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:21,800
Speaker 1: You could theoretically, but at the same time, you would also greatly reduce the quality of life and enjoyment of those events permanently.

461
00:40:22,481 --> 00:40:27,233
Speaker 0: Well, I think that you're just somewhat meh about wearing a mask, right?

462
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:29,519
Speaker 0: Doctors wear it all day, that'll give a shit, right?

463
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:33,240
Speaker 0: That's a you problem, huh, to wear a mask.

464
00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:39,740
Speaker 1: That's why, like I said, I will go back to cons when it is safe to go and prudent to go without a mask.

465
00:40:41,860 --> 00:40:43,580
Speaker 1: And there's a reason why right now we're not going to any cons.

466
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:48,020
Speaker 0: But the question I'm raising, though, is was it safe and prudent to go without a mask before COVID?

467
00:40:48,140 --> 00:40:50,500
Speaker 1: I mean, then what you're asking is a much broader question.

468
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,138
Speaker 0: Were we being cavalier and just getting sick and gross?

469
00:40:54,940 --> 00:40:59,140
Speaker 1: What you're asking is, should we make everyone wear masks in public all the time forever?

470
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,279
Speaker 0: It doesn't have to be, just inside.

471
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:03,199
Speaker 1: Inside all the time forever?

472
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:06,520
Speaker 0: In a place that is sufficiently crowded and not ventilated well enough.

473
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:08,480
Speaker 1: So what about bars and restaurants?

474
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,203
Speaker 0: No.

475
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:14,680
Speaker 1: What about schools, every convention, like everything?

476
00:41:15,642 --> 00:41:20,019
Speaker 0: I mean, will it be worth it if we do it long enough, if we actually could somehow miraculously do it?

477
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:21,817
Speaker 0: And make everyone do it.

478
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:27,480
Speaker 0: How long until, like, so many viruses are just gone, would it be worth it?

479
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,160
Speaker 1: Probably not, because you couldn't actually have complete coverage.

480
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:35,400
Speaker 0: Obviously, it's sort of a moot question, because we can't, right?

481
00:41:35,563 --> 00:41:36,680
Speaker 0: We won't get everyone to cooperate.

482
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,400
Speaker 1: Also, the accessibility aspects of that, people can't read lips very easily.

483
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,960
Speaker 1: People have a lot of difficulty understanding each other in crowded environments.

484
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:51,720
Speaker 0: There's plenty of issues, but it's like, the benefit of so many sicknesses just being gone, it's like, mmm, that's a tempting reward.

485
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:55,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it also means you have to keep wearing those masks forever.

486
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:01,620
Speaker 1: There's no, like, well, let's give up, because it's not like all viruses and bacteria and infections just disappear.

487
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:03,826
Speaker 0: No, but a lot of them.

488
00:42:04,026 --> 00:42:07,180
Speaker 0: They wouldn't disappear, but so many less people would get sick.

489
00:42:07,722 --> 00:42:10,419
Speaker 1: It's hard to say, because one thing I was seeing is that...

490
00:42:10,641 --> 00:42:12,780
Speaker 0: I haven't had any sickness whatsoever.

491
00:42:12,901 --> 00:42:15,799
Speaker 1: I have gotten, like, ten sinus infections.

492
00:42:16,562 --> 00:42:17,732
Speaker 0: Well, that's your noses first.

493
00:42:21,181 --> 00:42:28,400
Speaker 1: But yeah, I'm pretty much, I feel like next year might be the year that cons happen again, but we at least know the next two PAXes will require masks.

494
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,700
Speaker 1: And we'll see what, and MagFest looks like they're going to require masks.

495
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:40,000
Speaker 1: Though I am not booking travel to MagFest, because I'm not super confident that January is going to be a great time, COVID-wise, in America.

496
00:42:40,221 --> 00:42:43,079
Speaker 1: So I assume we're going to be skipping MagFest this coming year.

497
00:42:48,410 --> 00:42:51,090
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

498
00:42:51,310 --> 00:42:58,310
Speaker 1: So this video, the item that they make is beautiful, but the process is the point.

499
00:42:58,490 --> 00:43:08,770
Speaker 1: This is an 8 minute and 30 second long video that will take you through the process of making an extremely beautiful blue jelly cake.

500
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:10,616
Speaker 1: Night sky jelly.

501
00:43:10,998 --> 00:43:12,104
Speaker 1: It looks like a gem.

502
00:43:12,185 --> 00:43:13,170
Speaker 1: It's amazing looking.

503
00:43:13,652 --> 00:43:17,366
Speaker 1: But the process of making it is equally amazing looking.

504
00:43:17,406 --> 00:43:18,470
Speaker 1: It's basically an art piece.

505
00:43:19,511 --> 00:43:22,242
Speaker 1: The person making it is using all glassware.

506
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:23,889
Speaker 1: They've got light filtering through it.

507
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:29,530
Speaker 1: This video is the kind of thing you just put on in the evening before you go to bed and just watch it start to finish.

508
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:34,130
Speaker 1: I don't know what else I can say, except it's mesmerizing.

509
00:43:35,511 --> 00:43:36,833
Speaker 0: So it's like a double art, right?

510
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:45,610
Speaker 0: They're making a work of art, but then they found a way to make the work of art with particular tools in a particular setting so that it itself is a performance.

511
00:43:46,650 --> 00:43:48,213
Speaker 1: Exactly.

512
00:43:48,454 --> 00:43:56,490
Speaker 1: Like a concert I saw a long time ago where two dudes were painting random crap on big canvases on either side of a stage while a band was playing with them.

513
00:43:56,871 --> 00:44:05,610
Speaker 1: And over the course of this, their paintings, they ended up bringing the two paintings together and putting them at a weird angle and suddenly an image emerged that wasn't obvious from seeing them separately.

514
00:44:06,031 --> 00:44:09,030
Speaker 1: And they did it all as part of a single song on stage.

515
00:44:11,611 --> 00:44:18,650
Speaker 0: Alright, so there's a big, if you don't know, there's a huge community of nerds that love making keyboards, mechanical keyboards.

516
00:44:19,010 --> 00:44:23,129
Speaker 0: You buy switches, you buy caps, you can make custom boards, all kinds of stuff, right?

517
00:44:23,933 --> 00:44:27,590
Speaker 0: I've not seen too many people make custom mice.

518
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:33,430
Speaker 1: I feel like what I would do is take apart an existing mouse and build new components around it.

519
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:34,534
Speaker 0: Sure, you could do that, right?

520
00:44:34,554 --> 00:44:37,710
Speaker 0: But there's a few, obviously, but it's not common, right?

521
00:44:38,190 --> 00:44:40,617
Speaker 0: Custom gamepads, really common, right?

522
00:44:40,657 --> 00:44:45,310
Speaker 0: Changing out the shells, all kinds of stuff, but not too much in the custom mouse department.

523
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:47,459
Speaker 0: Well, here's a GitHub repository.

524
00:44:47,499 --> 00:44:49,970
Speaker 0: someone made that they're actively working on it.

525
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:56,870
Speaker 0: And in here, they've got everything you need to make a mouse from basically scratch, right?

526
00:44:56,890 --> 00:45:02,670
Speaker 0: We're talking the circuit boards, we're talking, you know, 3D printing the enclosure, we're talking driver software.

527
00:45:02,910 --> 00:45:07,650
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, everything that is necessary to create a computer mouse.

528
00:45:08,412 --> 00:45:09,597
Speaker 0: This is like the foundation.

529
00:45:09,637 --> 00:45:12,510
Speaker 0: And we're not talking regular old boring mouse, we're talking gaming mouse.

530
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:19,970
Speaker 0: So I could see this being the start of like an explosion of custom mouse making, right?

531
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:21,496
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, none of this.

532
00:45:21,516 --> 00:45:31,550
Speaker 0: having, you know, people who are really into, you know, computer stuff, the same people currently buying mechanical keyboard caps would no longer buy a Razer mouse or a Logitech mouse, right?

533
00:45:32,150 --> 00:45:33,256
Speaker 0: They'd all make a mouse.

534
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:34,865
Speaker 0: And that would be pretty sweet.

535
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:35,549
Speaker 0: I would love that.

536
00:45:36,191 --> 00:45:41,330
Speaker 0: Especially if those mice just have this nice open source driver, you don't got to install some bullshit Logitech software.

537
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:44,209
Speaker 0: To go with your mouse or whatever.

538
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:45,334
Speaker 1: I mean, you don't have to.

539
00:45:45,817 --> 00:45:48,510
Speaker 1: My weird Logitech mouse does just work without that weird driver.

540
00:45:49,510 --> 00:45:51,110
Speaker 0: Sure, but there's features that are not accessible.

541
00:45:51,110 --> 00:45:51,251
Speaker 1: It does.

542
00:45:51,372 --> 00:45:53,430
Speaker 1: I do install the driver because I use those features.

543
00:45:53,670 --> 00:46:01,710
Speaker 1: You can access those features without the driver, but you have to do it by fucking with the mouse itself, which is super annoying.

544
00:46:03,070 --> 00:46:04,686
Speaker 0: Depends on the features, depends on the mouse.

545
00:46:04,726 --> 00:46:05,050
Speaker 0: Regardless.

546
00:46:05,370 --> 00:46:10,290
Speaker 1: Like I remember I programmed, when I first got this mouse, I programmed all my settings into it rather than installing the driver.

547
00:46:10,692 --> 00:46:18,890
Speaker 1: But then when the mouse died, I had to reprogram all again, so then I installed the software, and I could save all those settings on the computer in a file that I could import into a new mouse.

548
00:46:19,790 --> 00:46:22,982
Speaker 0: I'm looking forward to the day where we can do custom trackpad, right?

549
00:46:23,022 --> 00:46:24,950
Speaker 0: That's like, that would be really sweet.

550
00:46:25,371 --> 00:46:30,210
Speaker 1: Ah, but what, I mean, for aesthetics, just take an existing trackpad and put a different, like, casing around it.

551
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:31,128
Speaker 0: It won't work.

552
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:32,456
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

553
00:46:32,476 --> 00:46:33,043
Speaker 1: it won't work?

554
00:46:33,063 --> 00:46:36,550
Speaker 0: What are you gonna- Would you take like an Apple Magic trackpad and put like a sticker on top of it?

555
00:46:36,610 --> 00:46:37,352
Speaker 1: No, not on top of it.

556
00:46:37,372 --> 00:46:39,118
Speaker 1: Like, so what, you just want to replace the surface?

557
00:46:39,278 --> 00:46:40,001
Speaker 1: Like, what are you gonna do?

558
00:46:40,221 --> 00:46:42,910
Speaker 1: that's gonna be better or different than an existing trackpad?

559
00:46:43,131 --> 00:46:46,139
Speaker 1: I mean, you could choose the size- Even a mouse, no one's gonna make a mouse that's different.

560
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:48,410
Speaker 1: They're just gonna make a mouse that aesthetically looks different.

561
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:52,541
Speaker 0: Well, you could choose the size, the texture, the colors, the material.

562
00:46:52,561 --> 00:46:55,530
Speaker 0: You know, there's a lot of factors there that, you know, mostly aesthetic ones.

563
00:46:55,530 --> 00:46:57,869
Speaker 1: I don't know if you have a lot of choice in the texture, considering how those things work.

564
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,242
Speaker 0: You might be some choice.

565
00:47:00,748 --> 00:47:00,950
Speaker 0: Some.

566
00:47:01,591 --> 00:47:01,971
Speaker 1: We'll see.

567
00:47:03,114 --> 00:47:10,150
Speaker 1: My counterpoint is I feel like this is gonna be a little too niche and never really kick off, except among mega nerds.

568
00:47:10,990 --> 00:47:11,291
Speaker 0: We'll see.

569
00:47:12,313 --> 00:47:17,142
Speaker 0: You know, someone just designs, you know, a board, an enclosure, and then, you know, the mechanical keyboard.

570
00:47:17,162 --> 00:47:21,310
Speaker 0: people, they do these group buys, right, where they put an order in, and then they let enough people order it.

571
00:47:21,490 --> 00:47:28,750
Speaker 0: So it's like, you just need one person to make a design, and then they put the order in and do the group buy, and then eventually everyone gets a mouse.

572
00:47:28,890 --> 00:47:34,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it'll be interesting if someone designs, because the thing that I'm most interested in in mice, like the internals, they're fine.

573
00:47:35,071 --> 00:47:38,510
Speaker 1: All I care about is the shape of the mouse itself, the physical form factor.

574
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:44,970
Speaker 1: If someone designed a really interesting, cool one that let me get away from these angular things that I'm using now.

575
00:47:45,750 --> 00:47:46,382
Speaker 0: -Pilot razor blades.

576
00:47:46,403 --> 00:47:46,648
Speaker 0: -Yeah.

577
00:47:47,330 --> 00:47:50,018
Speaker 1: Granted, I'm not that fussed about the pilot razor blades.

578
00:47:50,059 --> 00:47:53,710
Speaker 1: Like, I got a pilot razor blades right now, and it works okay.

579
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:55,395
Speaker 1: -Plus I got my little thumb shelf, which I'm still...

580
00:47:55,415 --> 00:48:00,530
Speaker 0: -I got the default razor mouse, the Death Adder Elite, and there's only two complaints I have with it.

581
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:07,210
Speaker 0: One, the software, obviously, and two, it has these rubber grips on the side, and they're just, like, they're coming off.

582
00:48:07,631 --> 00:48:08,056
Speaker 1: -Oh, ew.

583
00:48:08,076 --> 00:48:08,238
Speaker 1: -Yeah.

584
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:09,872
Speaker 1: -Ew.

585
00:48:09,893 --> 00:48:11,910
Speaker 0: -But otherwise, it works perfectly.

586
00:48:12,771 --> 00:48:17,102
Speaker 1: I'm on my second, like, standard Logitech G50... I forget what the exact mouse it is.

587
00:48:17,142 --> 00:48:19,950
Speaker 1: The G502, that's the one, the Hero.

588
00:48:20,912 --> 00:48:22,889
Speaker 1: Well, my second one, I keep breaking these scroll wheels.

589
00:48:22,950 --> 00:48:24,969
Speaker 0: Look, now that I've played with the rubber bit, it's really coming off.

590
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,190
Speaker 1: Oh, oh, it's done, you're gonna get a new mouse now.

591
00:48:27,590 --> 00:48:28,830
Speaker 0: I got it back in, I got it back in.

592
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,264
Speaker 1: You're gonna unconsciously pick that thing out.

593
00:48:31,567 --> 00:48:31,949
Speaker 1: It's over.

594
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:35,440
Speaker 1: As soon as it's pickable, you're gonna pick it.

595
00:48:35,803 --> 00:48:36,869
Speaker 1: No human could resist that.

596
00:48:37,670 --> 00:48:38,669
Speaker 0: When did I get this mouse?

597
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:40,709
Speaker 1: You're thinking about picking at it right now.

598
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,369
Speaker 0: It's a four-year-old mouse.

599
00:48:43,351 --> 00:48:48,008
Speaker 1: I await the day, we're gonna be playing some video game, and you're like, "Wait a minute, give me a second, I just picked the thing off my

600
00:48:48,048 --> 00:48:48,309
Speaker 1: mouse.".

601
00:48:49,453 --> 00:48:49,730
Speaker 0: Anyway.

602
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:52,768
Speaker 1: In the meta moment, the Geek's Night Book Club book is Binti!

603
00:48:53,270 --> 00:48:57,967
Speaker 1: We should do the show, I assume you're not gonna read it by Thursday, so two weeks from now we should do the show.

604
00:48:58,008 --> 00:48:58,610
Speaker 1: It's a short read.

605
00:48:59,410 --> 00:48:59,603
Speaker 0: We'll see.

606
00:49:00,330 --> 00:49:02,269
Speaker 1: And then, uh, you get to pick the next book.

607
00:49:03,150 --> 00:49:20,310
Speaker 1: I did, and now I did tell the listener what the two choices will be for when I pick the next book, but I almost want to divert and, because I've never actually read all- Oh yeah.

608
00:49:20,750 --> 00:49:25,089
Speaker 0: I haven't chosen two books yet, and I don't know which two that you are thinking about.

609
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:30,350
Speaker 1: It's mostly that I want to see what your immediate reaction is to the choice.

610
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:31,195
Speaker 1: Okay.

611
00:49:31,470 --> 00:49:32,309
Speaker 1: When the time comes.

612
00:49:32,830 --> 00:49:34,393
Speaker 1: But, the Book Club book right now is Binti.

613
00:49:34,734 --> 00:49:47,030
Speaker 1: Otherwise, I will be live at PAX West 2022 on Sunday, September 4th at 1230 PM in a mask, because PAX not only just requires masks for all the attendees, even if you're on stage, you gotta wear a mask.

614
00:49:47,530 --> 00:49:48,390
Speaker 1: So, uh, do you wanna panel?

615
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:52,150
Speaker 0: Considering that's only a couple weeks from now, there is a 0% chance I'm going there.

616
00:49:52,470 --> 00:49:52,734
Speaker 1: Yep.

617
00:49:52,835 --> 00:49:53,769
Speaker 1: So, I'll be there for that.

618
00:49:53,910 --> 00:50:05,970
Speaker 1: Emily's got some stuff going on, and, uh, otherwise, we'll be spending most of our time outside of the con, bumming around in Seattle, 'cause I'm not super into playing board games in masks in a crowded, loud convention center.

619
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:07,569
Speaker 1: I think I can wait on that a little bit.

620
00:50:09,034 --> 00:50:11,110
Speaker 1: Uh, I think that's all we got going.

621
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:12,509
Speaker 1: I know the website's coming along.

622
00:50:12,950 --> 00:50:17,130
Speaker 1: We'll do a show on Thursday on something, and, uh, let's get right into the main bit.

623
00:50:17,211 --> 00:50:18,409
Speaker 1: Casino games!

624
00:50:19,630 --> 00:50:25,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, we've talked a lot on this show, and elsewhere, about, you know, evils of gambling, right?

625
00:50:26,590 --> 00:50:27,998
Speaker 0: You know, luck in games.

626
00:50:28,139 --> 00:50:30,050
Speaker 0: You know, casinos are bad.

627
00:50:30,550 --> 00:50:38,050
Speaker 0: But we've never actually done a show about the games of chance that are commonly played in casinos.

628
00:50:38,730 --> 00:50:40,170
Speaker 0: Like, the games specifically.

629
00:50:40,851 --> 00:50:40,912
Speaker 1: Yep.

630
00:50:41,012 --> 00:50:45,830
Speaker 1: So, we're gonna review, like, slot machine as a game, or craps as a game.

631
00:50:46,394 --> 00:50:48,750
Speaker 0: I think slot machine is definitely the number one game, right?

632
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,290
Speaker 0: So, slot machine is an awful game.

633
00:50:51,770 --> 00:50:56,470
Speaker 0: You pull up, you push a button, and it either says you win or you lose, and that's it.

634
00:50:56,831 --> 00:51:00,970
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, in some ways, that's just awful.

635
00:51:01,330 --> 00:51:04,001
Speaker 0: But in other ways, I actually kind of- It's pure!

636
00:51:04,022 --> 00:51:07,150
Speaker 1: It's not like- The pure, original one-armed bandit isn't lying to you.

637
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:08,183
Speaker 0: It's like, "Hey, hit this

638
00:51:08,508 --> 00:51:08,670
Speaker 0: button!".

639
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:10,422
Speaker 0: Well, it is and it isn't lying to you.

640
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:11,450
Speaker 0: I'll talk about that in a second.

641
00:51:11,830 --> 00:51:13,170
Speaker 1: Oh, I got some things to say about that, too.

642
00:51:13,271 --> 00:51:15,850
Speaker 1: I specifically called out old games for a reason.

643
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:24,210
Speaker 0: There are a lot of games that are actually just slot machines with just obscuring the fact that they're a slot machine.

644
00:51:24,910 --> 00:51:26,178
Speaker 0: The slot machine is honest.

645
00:51:26,238 --> 00:51:28,090
Speaker 0: It's like, look, there isn't really anything here.

646
00:51:28,191 --> 00:51:30,309
Speaker 0: You're just pushing a button and finding out if you won or not.

647
00:51:30,770 --> 00:51:33,050
Speaker 0: Candy Lad is a slot machine, right?

648
00:51:33,270 --> 00:51:37,950
Speaker 0: The turn order choice is the slot pull, and then you're finding out if you won, right?

649
00:51:38,331 --> 00:51:43,290
Speaker 0: It's like, there's no difference mechanically, so at least the slot machine is honest.

650
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,029
Speaker 0: It's push a button and I tell you if you won.

651
00:51:45,410 --> 00:51:45,605
Speaker 0: Yup.

652
00:51:46,691 --> 00:51:51,250
Speaker 1: So, I guess the thing about slot machines that I find interesting is that, like you said, there's no game there.

653
00:51:51,370 --> 00:52:13,067
Speaker 1: The game is just- It is completely random, you have no control over it, but the evolution of the slot machine moved from a way to get money from drunk people in bars to an entire industry that is designed around obfuscating without directly lying about the odds, and I've noticed that a lot of the popular slot machines seem to-

654
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:14,470
Speaker 0: In regulated casinos.

655
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:18,029
Speaker 0: We're only talking about regulated, non-cheating casinos.

656
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:22,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they give the player a lot of false choices.

657
00:52:22,970 --> 00:52:33,230
Speaker 1: They give you a lot of options that modify the odds in some way, but are you betting on all three lines, or all five lines, or all seven lines?

658
00:52:33,470 --> 00:52:34,790
Speaker 0: You can put in all these options.

659
00:52:34,810 --> 00:52:36,201
Speaker 0: How fast do you want to lose your money?

660
00:52:36,241 --> 00:52:37,450
Speaker 0: That's what that's asking you.

661
00:52:37,810 --> 00:52:49,990
Speaker 1: Yup, because when it comes to it, any game of pure chance, especially when the odds are against you, which in all casinos the odds are against you, that's how the casino makes money, the vig will always be there, the casino's always gonna win in the end.

662
00:52:50,450 --> 00:53:00,870
Speaker 1: Your best strategy, if you are gambling to win money, is to bet small amounts so that you can persist gambling as long as possible until you are ahead enough.

663
00:53:00,870 --> 00:53:06,790
Speaker 0: Betting five lines is basically almost identical to betting one line five times.

664
00:53:07,933 --> 00:53:08,878
Speaker 0: It's very close.

665
00:53:08,898 --> 00:53:14,850
Speaker 0: I don't want to say it's exact without doing the math on it, but you're basically just losing money faster when you bet more.

666
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:22,970
Speaker 0: The one thing that's evil about the slot machines, especially modern slot machines, is let's say, hypothetically, you have a one dollar slot machine.

667
00:53:23,090 --> 00:53:26,949
Speaker 0: You put in a dollar, you pull the lever, you find out if you won or not, right?

668
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:31,310
Speaker 0: Now, let's say you get, I don't know, three cherries, right?

669
00:53:31,430 --> 00:53:35,510
Speaker 0: And that's a jackpot, and it pays out like a thousand dollars.

670
00:53:36,370 --> 00:53:37,235
Speaker 0: Well, you just won $999, right?

671
00:53:40,750 --> 00:53:45,270
Speaker 0: Let's say you pull the slot machine and it gives you, I don't know, two bars and a watermelon.

672
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:53,250
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, the two bars maybe comes out to be like, you win, quote, win 50 cents, right?

673
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:57,886
Speaker 0: Well, actually, you put a dollar in the slot machine, so you really lost 50 cents, right?

674
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:04,964
Speaker 0: Slot machines, as they are designed today, pretty much universally, will never say you lose, right?

675
00:54:07,870 --> 00:54:12,230
Speaker 0: They'll at worst be like, they'll be silent, like you didn't win anything.

676
00:54:12,731 --> 00:54:18,487
Speaker 0: If you win 50 cents on a dollar bet, it will say, congratulations, you won 50 cents.

677
00:54:19,530 --> 00:54:21,985
Speaker 0: It's like, you didn't, you lost, you lost 50 cents, right?

678
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:23,889
Speaker 0: 'Cause you put in a dollar.

679
00:54:24,851 --> 00:54:41,790
Speaker 0: If I was in charge, I would make it illegal, 'cause this is the psychological manipulation, is that the slot machine should only be allowed to indicate, aesthetically or literally, a win, if the win is greater than the amount wagered, right?

680
00:54:41,790 --> 00:54:47,230
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they would game that you would win five cents over and over and over again.

681
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:52,190
Speaker 0: Sure, but that means you put in a dollar, if a dollar five comes out, you won five cents, great.

682
00:54:52,410 --> 00:54:52,503
Speaker 0: True.

683
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:58,950
Speaker 0: Good, that's much better than winning five cents when you actually lost 95 cents, right, on your dollar bet.

684
00:54:59,370 --> 00:55:05,610
Speaker 0: The other thing is, I do appreciate the aesthetics of slot machines, especially modern ones, like they're hella fancy.

685
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:07,935
Speaker 0: I remember

686
00:55:07,955 --> 00:55:35,229
Speaker 1: the last time we went to Atlantic City was right when all the holographic slot machines were all the rage, and everything were like these beautiful art canvases, kinda like the art on the back of old pinball machines, that's just beautiful, but they're of course, they're a skin on a garbo game, just like some terrible platformer that happened to have a Blues Brothers skin on it on the SNES, functionally identical to a similar game that has, I don't know, the home improvement skin over it.

687
00:55:35,891 --> 00:56:03,069
Speaker 0: What I think happened though is there was this era of slot machines getting fancier and fancier and cooler and cooler aesthetically, and then they all became like these video slots with just a big flat screen with a big flat LCD that has different graphics on it, and while the graphics might be really fancy from intellectual properties, I've seen Game of Thrones slot machines and shit like that, the machine is just a big machine with two LCD screens on it.

688
00:56:03,977 --> 00:56:11,150
Speaker 0: But I guess what I find interesting is that, I much prefer the fancy mechanical ones, same just like pinball, you want the fancy mechanical one.

689
00:56:11,450 --> 00:56:44,890
Speaker 1: Well like when we talk about nothing, when we talk about a game, especially when we review tabletop games, where the theme is what people care about, but we only review the game based on the game itself, like the game is what I care about, slot machines are basically that too, it is amazing to me that someone would decide to play a slot machine, and I imagine, because they wouldn't be doing this unless it works, they specifically choose to play the Game of Thrones slot machine because they like Game of Thrones, even though the Game of Thrones slot machine is 100% identical to the Porky Pig slot machine right next to it, in effect.

690
00:56:45,090 --> 00:56:56,288
Speaker 0: Well I guess in a typical casino, a fancy slot machine like the Game of Thrones one is going to be like a $20 slot, it's not going to be like, you know, if you want to play a penny slot, it's going to be like some sad old one that's just got three wheels,

691
00:56:56,569 --> 00:56:56,770
Speaker 1: right?

692
00:56:58,431 --> 00:57:05,850
Speaker 1: Well I mean the game itself of a slot machine really is just, what payout percentage did they program into that slot machine in the back?

693
00:57:06,731 --> 00:57:08,150
Speaker 0: And how fast do you want to lose your money?

694
00:57:08,570 --> 00:57:13,269
Speaker 1: Yup, but as a game, it's nothing, it's literally nothing, there is no game here.

695
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:19,610
Speaker 0: Alright so, the next video poker, video poker is 99% the same thing as a slot machine.

696
00:57:20,043 --> 00:57:20,249
Speaker 1: Yup.

697
00:57:21,030 --> 00:57:32,069
Speaker 0: The only difference is that you get one decision to make after the initial deal of cards, it's a very simple and obvious decision, I suppose you could fuck it up.

698
00:57:33,111 --> 00:57:34,150
Speaker 1: Yup, but it's one of those works.

699
00:57:34,570 --> 00:57:40,670
Speaker 0: The game could deal you four aces and you could just throw away two of them, it's not going to stop you from doing that.

700
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:51,910
Speaker 1: Video poker is amazing to me, and I've seen other games do this too, like not even just casino games, games that give the player a choice that is just a simple optimization problem.

701
00:57:52,570 --> 00:58:02,810
Speaker 1: Lot of tabletop games will have decisions that are like this, where if you lack the basic skills, the decision is meaningful to you, it is difficult to you, you have to make a decision.

702
00:58:03,270 --> 00:58:16,350
Speaker 1: But once you figure out how to play optimally, you literally will do it perfectly every time no matter what, there is no way you'll ever make a mistake, and now it just punishes people who cannot solve this very simple optimization puzzle.

703
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:26,650
Speaker 1: And I suspect this exists solely to give players an illusion of increased agency so that they feel like they have more input into the game than they do.

704
00:58:28,934 --> 00:58:41,370
Speaker 0: I think it is a literal illusion, I'm not 100% confident because I haven't googled it yet, but I am 90% plus sure that the decision you make on the video poker gambling machine doesn't actually matter.

705
00:58:42,472 --> 00:58:55,450
Speaker 0: The game is just using the same random number generator as a slot machine, deciding how much it's going to pay out, and if it's decided it's going to pay out a jackpot, you can just throw away all five cards and the next five cards will be a jackpot.

706
00:58:55,570 --> 00:58:58,777
Speaker 0: If you threw away one card, no matter what you do, I think it's going to force the result that it has decided.

707
00:59:05,290 --> 00:59:08,550
Speaker 0: If it decided you're going to lose, it's like, you're going to lose.

708
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:14,150
Speaker 0: I don't think it has a virtual deck of cards that it's legitimately shuffling.

709
00:59:14,470 --> 00:59:23,830
Speaker 0: I could be wrong, but that's my guess, it's the same thing as a slot machine, just with a skin that makes it feel like you're making a choice that matters when you're not.

710
00:59:24,251 --> 00:59:29,570
Speaker 1: It would have to be something like that, or else you couldn't guarantee the right returns to the casino.

711
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:31,809
Speaker 1: You couldn't guarantee your vig the right way.

712
00:59:33,170 --> 00:59:35,950
Speaker 1: But yeah, I would say video poker and a lot of games like it.

713
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:39,270
Speaker 1: There are a lot of games that aren't casino games that are like this.

714
00:59:39,370 --> 00:59:43,170
Speaker 1: They're games that give the player an illusion of agency, but there is in fact no agency.

715
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:48,070
Speaker 1: Video poker is just a slot machine, and a lot of those games are also just a slot machine.

716
00:59:48,830 --> 00:59:53,550
Speaker 0: Similarly, they have video bet on horses running around a digital horse race.

717
00:59:54,230 --> 00:59:56,774
Speaker 0: It's like, here's ten virtual horses.

718
00:59:56,814 --> 01:00:06,510
Speaker 0: they're about to race, place a bet, the random number generator chooses the order of the horse's result is going to be, and then the horses have different odds plugged in.

719
01:00:06,850 --> 01:00:15,250
Speaker 1: Well hell, make a slot machine that five tumblers line up, and then you get to keep one or more of them and spin again.

720
01:00:16,232 --> 01:00:17,050
Speaker 0: There are slots like that.

721
01:00:17,110 --> 01:00:17,733
Speaker 1: Yeah, exactly.

722
01:00:18,898 --> 01:00:21,390
Speaker 1: Video poker is just a slot machine with that rule, basically.

723
01:00:22,350 --> 01:00:26,922
Speaker 0: There are also slot machines where you can try to stop the spinners manually.

724
01:00:26,942 --> 01:00:29,127
Speaker 0: There's no skill to it.

725
01:00:29,368 --> 01:00:30,170
Speaker 0: It's impossible.

726
01:00:31,914 --> 01:00:34,070
Speaker 1: I guess we get through some of the garbo games first.

727
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:42,870
Speaker 1: There's a whole type of game that are in casinos, and I have only in my life ever seen extremely old people playing them.

728
01:00:43,331 --> 01:00:53,990
Speaker 1: This is bingo and keno and all the games like that, that are literally just buy a lottery ticket at the casino as opposed to buying a lottery ticket at the gas station, and then sit there.

729
01:00:55,110 --> 01:01:02,630
Speaker 0: We're having lotteries, we're gonna just play the lottery all damn day, just constant lotteries, buy tickets, choose numbers, whatever.

730
01:01:05,932 --> 01:01:15,970
Speaker 0: I think that the appeal of that is obviously it's just a lottery, but I think the appeal of it is that you sort of get that slow reveal you get with bingo.

731
01:01:16,530 --> 01:01:27,130
Speaker 0: There's this sort of anticipation and sort of an emotional narrative to the revealing of the numbers that happens based on which particular lottery type game you're playing.

732
01:01:28,931 --> 01:01:31,800
Speaker 0: Whereas a slot machine is sort of like an instant gratification.

733
01:01:31,841 --> 01:01:34,690
Speaker 0: It spins a little bit and then results.

734
01:01:35,490 --> 01:01:41,287
Speaker 0: Whereas the keno, if you're an old person at the casino, you could sit there quite a while, play bingo.

735
01:01:41,327 --> 01:01:42,190
Speaker 0: Bingo takes a while.

736
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:48,750
Speaker 0: You're sitting there playing bingo and you get that come on, come on feeling for quite a while, and then you lose your money.

737
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:56,430
Speaker 1: When I was a little kid, me and my brother and all the local kids, we had a little bingo machine, like the roller thing and everything, and we would just play bingo.

738
01:01:56,690 --> 01:02:01,566
Speaker 1: And I just remember having this moment where we sort of collectively were like, "Wait a minute, this game is fucking nothing,".

739
01:02:01,606 --> 01:02:02,569
Speaker 1: and we just never played it again.

740
01:02:03,610 --> 01:02:18,070
Speaker 0: Rumor has it that BB King, legendary musician BB King, knew something about keno, and when they would go with the band to the casino, everyone else would go and play normal casino shit and lose all their money.

741
01:02:18,691 --> 01:02:22,938
Speaker 0: And that BB King would play keno and somehow come out ahead every fucking time.

742
01:02:22,958 --> 01:02:30,970
Speaker 0: I don't believe that's the case, because the casino was crooked or they knew it was BB King.

743
01:02:33,152 --> 01:02:39,650
Speaker 0: But that is a legendary tale that, even though I don't literally believe it, I guess I can believe it in my heart.

744
01:02:39,650 --> 01:02:40,451
Speaker 1: Well you know what it could be?

745
01:02:40,511 --> 01:02:52,290
Speaker 1: So keno, unlike a lot of other games, we're not talking about casinos and payouts on this show, but keno, apparently many casinos used to have a much lower house edge on keno.

746
01:02:53,831 --> 01:02:57,284
Speaker 1: But it's not regulated, like you can pick whatever house edge you want effectively.

747
01:02:57,304 --> 01:03:00,029
Speaker 0: According to Wikipedia- As long as you're public about it.

748
01:03:00,170 --> 01:03:01,574
Speaker 1: Yep, the house edge ranges from 4% to

749
01:03:01,574 --> 01:03:08,270
Speaker 1: 35%. 35%!

750
01:03:08,270 --> 01:03:08,459
Speaker 0: Okay.

751
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:16,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like- Well look, if you want to play keno, obviously I recommend against gambling of any kind with real money.

752
01:03:16,710 --> 01:03:19,390
Speaker 1: If you want to play keno, figure out whatever BB King was doing.

753
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:23,080
Speaker 0: Right, but maybe look and see what the house edge is.

754
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,730
Speaker 0: If you've already decided you're going to do it, I can't stop you.

755
01:03:26,111 --> 01:03:26,171
Speaker 0: Yep.

756
01:03:26,819 --> 01:03:29,811
Speaker 0: It's interesting though- Don't play if it's 35%.

757
01:03:29,811 --> 01:03:37,810
Speaker 1: I feel like bingo, keno, slot machines, and video poker are all fundamentally the same game that just reveal the result in different ways.

758
01:03:38,290 --> 01:03:47,510
Speaker 1: And I feel like the four of them together are just designed to capture all the different types of person who could easily become addicted to that sensation.

759
01:03:48,010 --> 01:03:54,750
Speaker 1: Like the people who just get trapped in a chair at a casino and the penny slots every day for the rest of their lives.

760
01:03:56,010 --> 01:03:57,708
Speaker 1: Like I think they're just directly predatory games.

761
01:03:58,391 --> 01:04:08,190
Speaker 0: There's one more game that's exactly the same and that's roulette, which is reveal who- place your bets on numbers and reveal who won by a cool spinning ball thing.

762
01:04:08,690 --> 01:04:18,030
Speaker 1: Roulette, however, at least it's interesting, roulette has a sort of veneer of class over it because of how it's portrayed in movies.

763
01:04:18,070 --> 01:04:26,846
Speaker 1: Like a roulette wheel is an iconic thing that you see in movies that the society tells you, "Oh, classy people are playing this game.

764
01:04:26,926 --> 01:04:28,790
Speaker 0: Classy people are gambling

765
01:04:28,850 --> 01:04:28,930
Speaker 0: here.".

766
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:32,910
Speaker 0: Oh, you know, French nobles would play roulette in the castle or whatever, right?

767
01:04:33,190 --> 01:04:44,210
Speaker 1: But also, roulette is- what I do find interesting about roulette is that in the end, as a game, roulette- one, as a casino game, roulette has better payout odds than most other games.

768
01:04:44,430 --> 01:04:45,246
Speaker 0: Well, hold on.

769
01:04:45,670 --> 01:04:46,420
Speaker 0: Well, it used to.

770
01:04:47,591 --> 01:04:56,770
Speaker 0: The defining feature of roulette that I actually appreciate is that unlike- we just talked about how, you know, the casino controls the take on the keynote, right?

771
01:04:57,330 --> 01:05:03,990
Speaker 0: On roulette, all the choices are bad for you because you're not the house, but you choose the take.

772
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:08,350
Speaker 0: You could just bet on red every time or you can bet on 20 every time.

773
01:05:08,450 --> 01:05:12,710
Speaker 0: It's your choice how much you want to lose, how fast.

774
01:05:12,810 --> 01:05:13,610
Speaker 1: You choose your odds.

775
01:05:13,830 --> 01:05:15,550
Speaker 1: The game is just a push your luck game.

776
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:20,182
Speaker 1: You look at your current resources and you decide, "How much do I want to push my luck?

777
01:05:20,242 --> 01:05:22,589
Speaker 1: How much do I want to risk for a

778
01:05:22,629 --> 01:05:22,950
Speaker 1: reward?".

779
01:05:23,070 --> 01:05:25,030
Speaker 1: You basically pick your odds for every roll.

780
01:05:25,790 --> 01:05:28,670
Speaker 0: The casino might choose, you know, a high minimum for the table.

781
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:31,021
Speaker 0: It's like you can't even put a chip down and listen to $10, $20, $50 chip.

782
01:05:33,790 --> 01:05:37,970
Speaker 0: But at least, you know, you can choose where you put that chip, right?

783
01:05:38,530 --> 01:05:41,769
Speaker 0: So one thing that a lot of people don't know- You have a lot of fun and interest- you have a lot of choices.

784
01:05:43,251 --> 01:05:46,229
Speaker 0: None of them are particularly interesting, but they're kind of fun.

785
01:05:46,730 --> 01:05:52,070
Speaker 0: And the 0-0, while that is there for the casino's benefit, it's kind of fun if it happens.

786
01:05:52,410 --> 01:05:58,930
Speaker 1: The 0-0 is only an American roulette that was added to give the house more of an advantage.

787
01:05:59,350 --> 01:06:00,719
Speaker 1: French roulette only has 0.

788
01:06:00,719 --> 01:06:02,250
Speaker 1: 0-0 was an American invention.

789
01:06:03,410 --> 01:06:03,477
Speaker 1: Wow.

790
01:06:04,750 --> 01:06:11,650
Speaker 1: America is really good at just taking something and making it slightly worse and then mass producing it.

791
01:06:12,600 --> 01:06:13,430
Speaker 0: Today I learned.

792
01:06:14,530 --> 01:06:20,610
Speaker 0: But, you know, the physical nature of the roulette is kind of fun, right?

793
01:06:21,331 --> 01:06:27,345
Speaker 0: It's like I would play roulette for not real money, just chips.

794
01:06:27,385 --> 01:06:29,530
Speaker 0: you have lying around and a wheel, right?

795
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:36,790
Speaker 0: To decide, you know, as a random mechanism for something else, right?

796
01:06:36,850 --> 01:06:42,870
Speaker 1: I found roulette is okay as a social, almost like cosplaying/larping game.

797
01:06:43,030 --> 01:06:51,570
Speaker 1: Like it's a game where imagine you get around with people, you're dressed up in '20s gangster's clothes, and you roleplay gangsters while you're playing roulette.

798
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:54,010
Speaker 0: Oh, can I be the dealer who controls the rigged table?

799
01:06:54,290 --> 01:06:54,376
Speaker 0: Yeah!

800
01:06:55,591 --> 01:07:03,330
Speaker 1: That thing of the day years ago that someone took apart a legit rigged table from the '20s and they showed how it worked and it was fascinating.

801
01:07:03,350 --> 01:07:06,890
Speaker 0: But the physical nature of it is fun, right?

802
01:07:08,334 --> 01:07:12,130
Speaker 0: You don't get to put the ball on the wheel or spin it, but that would be fun if you did.

803
01:07:12,610 --> 01:07:14,549
Speaker 0: But even just putting chips on the table is fun.

804
01:07:15,010 --> 01:07:16,130
Speaker 1: So putting the ball on the table.

805
01:07:16,170 --> 01:07:17,429
Speaker 0: Everyone likes to play with chips.

806
01:07:18,170 --> 01:07:26,970
Speaker 1: That segues to what I believe is the second best casino game, but it's still a terrible bad game, don't get me wrong.

807
01:07:27,130 --> 01:07:27,768
Speaker 1: And that's craps.

808
01:07:28,190 --> 01:07:29,670
Speaker 1: Craps, you get to control the ball.

809
01:07:30,310 --> 01:07:32,750
Speaker 0: Craps, again, the actual game of craps.

810
01:07:33,190 --> 01:07:33,546
Speaker 0: Restrictions.

811
01:07:33,910 --> 01:07:42,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, so the actual game of craps, in my mind, I'm not going to try to explain to you how to play craps because craps- Watch a YouTube video about it.

812
01:07:42,690 --> 01:07:54,230
Speaker 1: Even then, I suspect you will be confused because what you will find is that most things that claim to teach you craps get way deep into bidding strategies and odds instead of just explaining the rules, which are actually pretty straightforward.

813
01:07:54,972 --> 01:08:03,710
Speaker 1: But I think the craps table is designed to be fast-moving, to confuse people to the point that they bet more than they expected.

814
01:08:03,970 --> 01:08:11,908
Speaker 1: I have witnessed people playing craps for real with real money who aren't quite sure what's going on, and then suddenly all their money's gone.

815
01:08:11,928 --> 01:08:12,690
Speaker 1: They don't know what happened.

816
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:21,888
Speaker 0: Right, so the thing with craps is that it's unlike the other games at the casino, it's sort of a cooperative game.

817
01:08:21,948 --> 01:08:22,790
Speaker 0: It's not actually cooperative.

818
01:08:22,830 --> 01:08:23,992
Speaker 0: It's fake cooperative.

819
01:08:24,193 --> 01:08:25,295
Speaker 1: It's a social game.

820
01:08:25,595 --> 01:08:32,227
Speaker 1: You're either betting with whoever's throwing the dice, or you're betting against whoever's throwing the dice.

821
01:08:32,307 --> 01:08:33,569
Speaker 0: And that feels fun.

822
01:08:34,571 --> 01:08:36,537
Speaker 0: It's not like you win more.

823
01:08:36,598 --> 01:08:38,243
Speaker 0: It's not like you're actually cooperating.

824
01:08:38,283 --> 01:08:40,670
Speaker 0: It's not like if rim wins, I win, right?

825
01:08:41,130 --> 01:08:45,060
Speaker 0: It's like we're all betting on the same, most of us, right?

826
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,710
Speaker 0: Most of the people at the table are betting for the same thing to happen.

827
01:08:49,470 --> 01:08:51,474
Speaker 0: We're all betting different amounts.

828
01:08:51,915 --> 01:08:55,962
Speaker 0: Everyone's betting different amounts, but most of us want the same thing to happen.

829
01:08:56,024 --> 01:08:59,189
Speaker 0: So if that thing happens, everyone at the table wins.

830
01:08:59,649 --> 01:09:04,457
Speaker 0: So it's sort of like when you're at a sporting event and you all want your team to win, only your team is just dice.

831
01:09:04,999 --> 01:09:09,145
Speaker 0: It's like you're all in it together, and if the dice come up good, everyone's like,

832
01:09:09,166 --> 01:09:09,867
Speaker 0: "Yeah!"

833
01:09:10,148 --> 01:09:11,410
Speaker 0: High-fiving and shit, right?

834
01:09:11,450 --> 01:09:13,604
Speaker 0: And if the dice come up bad, everyone's like, "Fuck

835
01:09:13,645 --> 01:09:13,805
Speaker 0: you!".

836
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:21,317
Speaker 1: And this is what I find fascinating because roulette has this veneer of classiness, and it has these physical artifacts.

837
01:09:21,738 --> 01:09:33,470
Speaker 1: It's almost like craps and roulette draw a kind of person to play them that can't be gotten by the slot machine, even though in the end, they're really the same game, just with a different skin.

838
01:09:34,691 --> 01:09:38,000
Speaker 0: There is also the social thing going on with craps, right?

839
01:09:38,020 --> 01:09:41,189
Speaker 0: Because of the winning together, rooting together for the same result.

840
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:46,404
Speaker 1: Or betting against, "I got booed at a craps table because I bet don't pass.

841
01:09:46,765 --> 01:09:47,889
Speaker 1: I bet against the

842
01:09:47,929 --> 01:09:48,210
Speaker 1: roller.".

843
01:09:49,050 --> 01:09:54,990
Speaker 0: But also, you can bet and you can be someone who bets and rolls the dice simultaneously.

844
01:09:55,670 --> 01:09:58,170
Speaker 1: In fact, most places you have to put a bet down if you're rolling.

845
01:09:59,056 --> 01:09:59,390
Speaker 0: Exactly.

846
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:04,250
Speaker 1: And they let you keep rolling until you lose, and then it's sort of a social thing of who gets to roll next.

847
01:10:04,812 --> 01:10:10,150
Speaker 0: But it's like, if you're rolling, it's like you're rolling for everybody, right?

848
01:10:10,370 --> 01:10:10,470
Speaker 0: Yeah.

849
01:10:10,691 --> 01:10:14,729
Speaker 0: So it's like, even though it's completely random and superstitious, right?

850
01:10:15,310 --> 01:10:25,390
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, because the betting, if I actually explained the detailed rules of all the different bets you can put, imagine Gonshan Clever, but if it doesn't actually tell you what to do.

851
01:10:25,410 --> 01:10:35,150
Speaker 1: Imagine if Gonshan Clever had another set of places you could put dice that wasn't marked on your score sheet, but you just had to know that you could do that.

852
01:10:35,870 --> 01:10:37,109
Speaker 1: Craps has shit like that.

853
01:10:37,530 --> 01:10:41,705
Speaker 0: But when you roll the dice, they force you to A, roll these casino dice.

854
01:10:41,746 --> 01:10:42,910
Speaker 0: They're not rigged, right?

855
01:10:44,232 --> 01:10:49,790
Speaker 1: Even worse, they will usually present to you five dice, and you pick which two you want to use.

856
01:10:50,371 --> 01:10:56,948
Speaker 0: And if you mess up, and if at any moment you accidentally conceal the dice and no one can see them, they'll be like,

857
01:10:56,968 --> 01:10:57,088
Speaker 0: "Hey!".

858
01:10:58,831 --> 01:11:02,230
Speaker 0: There's no way you could possibly swap out the dice for some rigged ones, right?

859
01:11:03,491 --> 01:11:16,350
Speaker 0: And then when you throw them, throw them however the hell you want, they must, in order for the dice roll to count, the dice have to go all the way across the whole table, and both have to hit the wall on the other side of the table.

860
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:22,290
Speaker 0: And the wall on the other side of the table has all these foam spikes on it that are going to bounce the dice all over the hell.

861
01:11:22,370 --> 01:11:23,989
Speaker 1: You're not going to Jugadoo Jones this one.

862
01:11:25,030 --> 01:11:32,390
Speaker 0: And thankfully, the one great feature is that unlike your RPG tables, your dice aren't going to fall on the floor because the walls are high.

863
01:11:34,033 --> 01:11:35,910
Speaker 0: If they do fall on the floor, it obviously doesn't count.

864
01:11:36,170 --> 01:11:44,050
Speaker 0: So it's like there's no way you're going to cheat, it's completely random, it doesn't matter who throws the dice, but there's a social element to being the person who's throwing.

865
01:11:44,751 --> 01:11:55,050
Speaker 1: Well, there's a social element to the game itself, because the game, I think roulette, uses this veneer of classiness and this evocation of the French Riviera to get people invested in playing the game.

866
01:11:55,850 --> 01:12:03,949
Speaker 1: Craps causes a spectacle at the table, like at that one pack where we were playing Ghost Court and random strangers were coming up like, "What the fuck's going on

867
01:12:03,989 --> 01:12:04,209
Speaker 1: here?".

868
01:12:04,610 --> 01:12:07,327
Speaker 1: Or tumbling dice and random strangers like, "What's going on

869
01:12:07,367 --> 01:12:07,528
Speaker 1: here?".

870
01:12:09,451 --> 01:12:14,789
Speaker 1: It's the table, people are yelling, there's stuff going on, and if you walk over, it's real easy to join in.

871
01:12:15,452 --> 01:12:16,946
Speaker 1: I've seen people like, "Oh, give me some

872
01:12:16,966 --> 01:12:17,168
Speaker 1: chips!".

873
01:12:17,370 --> 01:12:19,025
Speaker 1: And they put them down, "Now you bet, you're

874
01:12:19,106 --> 01:12:19,167
Speaker 1: in!".

875
01:12:19,610 --> 01:12:26,210
Speaker 1: And the game has increasingly complex, advanced bets you can make.

876
01:12:26,271 --> 01:12:27,308
Speaker 0: I don't know how any of those work.

877
01:12:28,053 --> 01:12:28,989
Speaker 1: I do know how they work.

878
01:12:29,491 --> 01:12:31,350
Speaker 0: I only know how the normal one works, and that's enough.

879
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:33,089
Speaker 0: Because I would never bet on anything else.

880
01:12:33,150 --> 01:12:37,070
Speaker 1: I have played craps in real casinos on a number of occasions.

881
01:12:37,213 --> 01:12:38,090
Speaker 1: I would not do it again.

882
01:12:38,210 --> 01:12:39,510
Speaker 1: I haven't done it in over a decade.

883
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:40,409
Speaker 1: Fuck this shit.

884
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:49,870
Speaker 1: But craps, basically, I think, is designed to get people to start playing and not fully understand what's going on.

885
01:12:50,652 --> 01:12:54,610
Speaker 1: They understand that I'm either betting for the guy rolling the dice or against the guy rolling the dice.

886
01:12:55,010 --> 01:13:06,630
Speaker 1: And the game is designed to use the rituals and the social peer pressure to draw you into making worse and worse bets as you start doing the more and more advanced things as you learn how to play.

887
01:13:06,931 --> 01:13:16,510
Speaker 1: And craps, unlike most other casino games, has this whole fucking language and lexicon like roll for the galaxy and race for the galaxy and all this slang.

888
01:13:16,891 --> 01:13:19,570
Speaker 1: And they, like, intimate and bring you into this world.

889
01:13:19,711 --> 01:13:22,249
Speaker 1: And they use this terminology and expect you to start using it.

890
01:13:22,771 --> 01:13:31,270
Speaker 1: And I think it gives people a false sense of control and a false sense of mastery on what is, in the end, just a slot machine by way of a bunch of obfuscation.

891
01:13:31,973 --> 01:13:35,630
Speaker 0: There is one more even darker element to craps, right?

892
01:13:35,770 --> 01:13:37,430
Speaker 0: And that is this multiplier, right?

893
01:13:37,790 --> 01:13:44,990
Speaker 0: So basically you bet on, you know, you make the normal bet like we want the craps to, you know, pass or don't pass, basically.

894
01:13:45,571 --> 01:13:45,831
Speaker 0: Right.

895
01:13:46,152 --> 01:13:52,850
Speaker 0: And then after if you're if it's going to if you get the first number down, we really don't want to explain the rules.

896
01:13:52,971 --> 01:13:56,649
Speaker 0: But, you know, the first number happens, which means, OK, it's possible for us to win.

897
01:13:57,232 --> 01:14:00,724
Speaker 0: You can basically put a multiplied second bet, basically, sort of like.

898
01:14:00,885 --> 01:14:02,350
Speaker 1: this is one of those things that is not.

899
01:14:02,610 --> 01:14:05,848
Speaker 1: So the board, the table has places to put your bets like a table.

900
01:14:06,571 --> 01:14:09,610
Speaker 1: But the bet Scott's describing, there's no place for that.

901
01:14:09,730 --> 01:14:10,253
Speaker 1: You just put it.

902
01:14:10,273 --> 01:14:13,310
Speaker 0: you just put it behind your like on this unmarked area.

903
01:14:13,651 --> 01:14:14,294
Speaker 1: There's that.

904
01:14:14,495 --> 01:14:17,670
Speaker 1: I'm telling you, this is designed to cause a little bit regardless.

905
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:18,651
Speaker 0: Right.

906
01:14:18,772 --> 01:14:24,470
Speaker 0: The point is, is that tables will list a minimum bet and will also list a multiplier.

907
01:14:24,691 --> 01:14:24,911
Speaker 0: Right.

908
01:14:24,951 --> 01:14:31,190
Speaker 0: So if the multiplier is like 10 X, which is high, you could bet 10 more than your initial bet on the multiplier part.

909
01:14:31,350 --> 01:14:35,330
Speaker 1: And even worse, the odds are actually pretty good on the multiplier bets.

910
01:14:36,210 --> 01:14:47,990
Speaker 0: If the multiplier is high enough, craps actually can mathematically become, I don't want to say disadvantageous to the house, but not like the worst.

911
01:14:48,070 --> 01:14:55,430
Speaker 0: Like one of the better more ways you can spend your money, lose your money in a casino would be to make a high multiplier.

912
01:14:55,670 --> 01:15:00,670
Speaker 0: Bets at craps is one of the better choices, but better ways to lose.

913
01:15:00,810 --> 01:15:00,951
Speaker 0: Right.

914
01:15:01,011 --> 01:15:06,849
Speaker 0: It's still a losing bet, but it's not as bad as some of the other like a slot machine or the other things you could do.

915
01:15:07,790 --> 01:15:10,050
Speaker 0: Casinos will, especially on the strip.

916
01:15:10,591 --> 01:15:10,851
Speaker 0: Right.

917
01:15:10,972 --> 01:15:17,270
Speaker 0: In like in Vegas, where there's casinos competing with each other and walking foot traffic or Atlantic City, where there's foot traffic.

918
01:15:18,651 --> 01:15:25,750
Speaker 0: Put a craps table at the front of the casino by the entrance with a high multiplier, which will attract a crowd.

919
01:15:26,252 --> 01:15:29,150
Speaker 0: People will be making a lot of money because of the high multiplier.

920
01:15:29,791 --> 01:15:30,011
Speaker 0: Right.

921
01:15:30,332 --> 01:15:40,870
Speaker 0: And there'll be excitement and it will be sort of like a loss leader for the casino itself to get people into the casino because they see the craps table is out front by the door.

922
01:15:41,272 --> 01:15:43,849
Speaker 0: People come in because there's all that excitement there.

923
01:15:44,211 --> 01:15:48,870
Speaker 0: And now those people are ensnared by the rest of the casino where they lose money even faster.

924
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:59,450
Speaker 0: The other thing I've seen only a few intelligent people who will not I don't want to say intelligent, but like that will just stay at the craps table and bet that multiplier and slowly.

925
01:16:00,391 --> 01:16:06,070
Speaker 1: But I've also seen a lot of casinos will have a very high minimum on their craps tables.

926
01:16:07,191 --> 01:16:09,335
Speaker 1: Yeah.

927
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:16,589
Speaker 0: I think casinos in general these days have a lot of high minimums on everything, especially table games that aren't like.

928
01:16:16,990 --> 01:16:17,411
Speaker 1: Yeah.

929
01:16:17,471 --> 01:16:28,890
Speaker 1: Like there are a lot of non-traditional table games that have hit the market that are just worse than anything we've described, but are designed to like, I don't know, predate on a modern generation.

930
01:16:29,310 --> 01:16:34,830
Speaker 0: Like they're designed, you know, the last time I was in a casino, I was like, you know, you know, it's like, I know I'm going to lose all my money.

931
01:16:35,131 --> 01:16:35,312
Speaker 0: Right.

932
01:16:35,372 --> 01:16:39,488
Speaker 0: But it's like, if I put 25 cents in Pac-Man, I'm losing 25 cents no matter what happens.

933
01:16:39,709 --> 01:16:39,910
Speaker 0: Right.

934
01:16:40,330 --> 01:16:47,050
Speaker 0: So it's like at least in a casino, if I put 25 cents, it's like, there's a non-zero chance some of that money comes back.

935
01:16:47,451 --> 01:16:47,732
Speaker 0: Right.

936
01:16:48,014 --> 01:16:51,590
Speaker 0: You know, don't do this, but that's true.

937
01:16:52,252 --> 01:16:55,004
Speaker 0: And I'm like, you know, I'm here to basically purchase entertainment.

938
01:16:55,044 --> 01:16:56,330
Speaker 0: I expect to lose all this money.

939
01:16:56,853 --> 01:16:59,350
Speaker 0: I want to lose it slowly in the most fun way possible.

940
01:16:59,811 --> 01:17:00,032
Speaker 0: Right.

941
01:17:00,493 --> 01:17:06,190
Speaker 0: But the table games are obviously the fun, interesting, you know, tactile thing, throwing the dice and whatnot.

942
01:17:06,270 --> 01:17:06,591
Speaker 0: Right.

943
01:17:06,993 --> 01:17:11,810
Speaker 0: So then you go over to the craps area and it's like the cheapest table will be like five dollar minimum.

944
01:17:12,031 --> 01:17:14,028
Speaker 0: That's like a bidding five dollars, five.

945
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:16,772
Speaker 0: It's more like 40.

946
01:17:16,772 --> 01:17:17,758
Speaker 0: Well, I see that's the thing.

947
01:17:17,778 --> 01:17:19,670
Speaker 0: But at the smallest one might be five.

948
01:17:19,750 --> 01:17:22,632
Speaker 0: You're more likely to see like 10, 15, 20.

949
01:17:22,632 --> 01:17:22,792
Speaker 0: Right.

950
01:17:22,832 --> 01:17:23,515
Speaker 0: As the lowest.

951
01:17:23,575 --> 01:17:28,150
Speaker 0: It's like you can bet 20 whole fucking dollars on one goddamn roll of craps.

952
01:17:28,390 --> 01:17:28,511
Speaker 0: Right.

953
01:17:28,531 --> 01:17:30,908
Speaker 0: Not one literal roll of the dice, but like one, you know.

954
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,330
Speaker 1: I mean, you could additionally bet 20 dollars on one roll of the dice.

955
01:17:34,570 --> 01:17:35,127
Speaker 1: You can bet the field.

956
01:17:37,374 --> 01:17:39,250
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, you're not.

957
01:17:40,410 --> 01:17:42,950
Speaker 0: But I guess that's a lot of fucking money to bet at once.

958
01:17:43,030 --> 01:17:50,990
Speaker 0: It's like if they had a 50 cent craps table, I could, you know, I could reasonably sit there and lose money slowly for like a few hours.

959
01:17:51,131 --> 01:17:55,070
Speaker 0: But it's like for 20 bucks, it's like I'm not even touching that you out of your mind.

960
01:17:55,470 --> 01:18:00,290
Speaker 1: The design of the game is such that it will incur all the bets you have to make.

961
01:18:00,410 --> 01:18:07,410
Speaker 1: The odds are obfuscated and the game moves fast to try to convince you to make mistakes, basically, and not actually play the odds.

962
01:18:08,270 --> 01:18:08,752
Speaker 0: All right.

963
01:18:08,832 --> 01:18:13,330
Speaker 0: So I guess the last big game, because we got a lot of time here, the mega popular one is poker.

964
01:18:13,971 --> 01:18:14,429
Speaker 0: Actual poker.

965
01:18:15,211 --> 01:18:17,289
Speaker 0: Actual poker, Holdem, et cetera.

966
01:18:17,630 --> 01:18:17,731
Speaker 0: Right.

967
01:18:18,336 --> 01:18:20,010
Speaker 0: And mostly Texas Holdem is the game.

968
01:18:20,572 --> 01:18:25,750
Speaker 0: And the interesting thing about Holdem is that you are not playing against the house.

969
01:18:26,050 --> 01:18:28,890
Speaker 0: You are playing against the other people you're playing poker with.

970
01:18:29,010 --> 01:18:33,442
Speaker 0: And the house is basically taking a just a normal a cut straight across the board.

971
01:18:34,124 --> 01:18:36,250
Speaker 0: because they are facilitating the poker game.

972
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:41,230
Speaker 0: They're providing the table, the dealer, the cards, the you know, the making sure no one cheats, et cetera.

973
01:18:41,412 --> 01:18:42,650
Speaker 0: They're providing this service.

974
01:18:43,071 --> 01:18:49,230
Speaker 0: So they take a cut and you could actually win if you're better at poker than the people you're playing against.

975
01:18:49,611 --> 01:18:57,990
Speaker 0: But if everyone is, you know, a Texas Holdem master type person, of which there are many such people, then again, it becomes a game of luck.

976
01:18:59,694 --> 01:19:05,510
Speaker 0: But it at least has, you know, a skill element that the other games don't have.

977
01:19:06,151 --> 01:19:13,170
Speaker 0: And it has an element of not just a game of chance, as long as there is some skill disparity present.

978
01:19:14,112 --> 01:19:22,850
Speaker 1: So I still think it would be fascinating to play serious games with a betting structure around them in an environment.

979
01:19:23,090 --> 01:19:26,390
Speaker 0: I mean, I would love for there to be a place right.

980
01:19:26,590 --> 01:19:32,970
Speaker 0: Much like a casino that would facilitate and take a cut of competitive games that were skill based.

981
01:19:33,372 --> 01:19:36,650
Speaker 0: You know, we want to bet on table tennis.

982
01:19:37,031 --> 01:19:39,959
Speaker 0: You provide a judge and a table and equipment.

983
01:19:39,979 --> 01:19:42,686
Speaker 0: that's all checked out and we'll pay you a cut.

984
01:19:43,128 --> 01:19:44,030
Speaker 0: and we're mean.

985
01:19:44,411 --> 01:19:51,550
Speaker 0: This other person are going to bet on our game of table tennis and you're going to take all our money and give the money to the winner to make sure there's no shenanigans.

986
01:19:52,272 --> 01:19:52,533
Speaker 0: Right.

987
01:19:52,835 --> 01:19:53,680
Speaker 0: It's like that's.

988
01:19:54,224 --> 01:19:55,210
Speaker 0: that sounds good to me.

989
01:19:55,350 --> 01:20:00,629
Speaker 0: I mean, I wouldn't do that because I can't play table tennis, but people who are good at table tennis would be perfectly reasonable to do that.

990
01:20:00,911 --> 01:20:01,091
Speaker 0: Right.

991
01:20:01,995 --> 01:20:03,924
Speaker 0: It's not a casino where you're guaranteed to lose.

992
01:20:03,944 --> 01:20:05,310
Speaker 0: You're betting on your own skills.

993
01:20:06,852 --> 01:20:08,363
Speaker 0: You know, it's not really gambling.

994
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:09,329
Speaker 0: It's not a game of chance.

995
01:20:09,751 --> 01:20:12,464
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you take the betting out, if we're just reviewing the games, poker is...

996
01:20:13,911 --> 01:20:18,910
Speaker 0: I would just pay for someone to provide equipment and judge a game that had no prize.

997
01:20:19,892 --> 01:20:20,173
Speaker 1: Yep.

998
01:20:20,293 --> 01:20:24,790
Speaker 1: Pay someone to just set up, I don't know, the four hour long German board game.

999
01:20:25,111 --> 01:20:26,418
Speaker 1: Make sure everyone follows the rules.

1000
01:20:26,478 --> 01:20:27,484
Speaker 1: Facilitate everything.

1001
01:20:27,544 --> 01:20:28,590
Speaker 1: Count the victory points at the end.

1002
01:20:28,831 --> 01:20:30,800
Speaker 0: Please facilitate this game of diplomacy.

1003
01:20:30,840 --> 01:20:32,006
Speaker 0: so it goes quickly for us.

1004
01:20:32,066 --> 01:20:32,830
Speaker 0: Here's 50 bucks.

1005
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:34,516
Speaker 1: That's actually something I've never seen.

1006
01:20:34,937 --> 01:20:37,730
Speaker 1: That is the high class board game cafe.

1007
01:20:38,351 --> 01:20:39,955
Speaker 1: It's basically like a casino.

1008
01:20:40,195 --> 01:20:45,870
Speaker 1: There's no gambling, but there is a. there is a like a pit boss at every table, like running everything.

1009
01:20:46,030 --> 01:20:47,615
Speaker 0: You're paying for facilitate.

1010
01:20:47,655 --> 01:20:48,197
Speaker 0: I would love that.

1011
01:20:48,338 --> 01:20:52,130
Speaker 0: So poker, Texas Hold'em is the closest you get to that in a casino.

1012
01:20:53,552 --> 01:20:59,950
Speaker 0: I guess the final game we should mention is Blackjack, which is still is just a game of chance, just like all those other ones.

1013
01:21:00,390 --> 01:21:06,090
Speaker 0: But there's the counting element, which basically doesn't really exist anymore because they've mitigated it so much.

1014
01:21:06,270 --> 01:21:10,159
Speaker 1: Or even if it does exist, it doesn't matter.

1015
01:21:10,319 --> 01:21:14,870
Speaker 1: Even if you count perfectly, it's still random enough to where you're not going to come out ahead.

1016
01:21:15,711 --> 01:21:16,172
Speaker 0: Most of the time.

1017
01:21:16,192 --> 01:21:23,070
Speaker 0: But there was indeed a period of time where there was a way to cheat the game in quotes, right?

1018
01:21:24,731 --> 01:21:27,630
Speaker 0: And that makes it, I guess, different than the other casino games.

1019
01:21:27,990 --> 01:21:35,450
Speaker 1: Blackjack has pretty much always existed solely to convince people who think they're smarter than they are that they can beat the house.

1020
01:21:35,851 --> 01:21:45,130
Speaker 0: I think that before card counting was discovered, slash invented, slash mastered, perfected some decades past.

1021
01:21:45,691 --> 01:21:45,932
Speaker 0: Right.

1022
01:21:46,755 --> 01:21:48,681
Speaker 0: It was just a game of chance like the others.

1023
01:21:48,761 --> 01:21:51,190
Speaker 0: But once it was discovered, it's like, well, why keep it?

1024
01:21:51,731 --> 01:22:01,410
Speaker 0: And they keep it, I think, for the reason you just said is that because there is this history of people being able to beat it, but it's been mitigated.

1025
01:22:02,031 --> 01:22:10,890
Speaker 0: They can get rubes who believe they can beat it to come and play what the rube who knows all the other games are a game of chance thinks Blackjack isn't.

1026
01:22:11,591 --> 01:22:12,236
Speaker 0: And it is.

1027
01:22:12,398 --> 01:22:13,730
Speaker 0: And they lose their money on it, right?

1028
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:20,090
Speaker 0: It's sort of like a next level bluff by the house to keep the Blackjack tables.

1029
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:24,850
Speaker 1: Blackjack as a game is interesting in that it's a good game for kids and a terrible game for adults.

1030
01:22:24,870 --> 01:22:31,068
Speaker 1: Because if you play single deck Blackjack with kids, there's actually like kids will learn about.

1031
01:22:31,088 --> 01:22:31,890
Speaker 1: just like I used to play.

1032
01:22:32,230 --> 01:22:34,316
Speaker 1: Grandma would deal Blackjack for me and my brother.

1033
01:22:34,376 --> 01:22:39,610
Speaker 1: We play with poker chips and it was actually pretty fun a little bit until we learned how to do math.

1034
01:22:41,211 --> 01:22:52,210
Speaker 1: But also, grandma didn't follow the normal casino rules because in a casino, the dealer has rules they have to hit in certain situations like they can't just play at their own discretion.

1035
01:22:52,270 --> 01:22:53,338
Speaker 1: They're following a playbook.

1036
01:22:53,741 --> 01:22:54,889
Speaker 1: Grandma just played to win.

1037
01:22:57,411 --> 01:23:05,063
Speaker 0: So if you had Microsoft Entertainment Pack for Windows 3.1, it came with a Blackjack that was called Dr.

1038
01:23:05,123 --> 01:23:09,370
Speaker 0: Blackjack, which before Microsoft bought it was called Professor Blackjack.

1039
01:23:09,951 --> 01:23:10,742
Speaker 1: I remember Dr.

1040
01:23:10,763 --> 01:23:11,250
Speaker 1: Blackjack.

1041
01:23:11,850 --> 01:23:13,114
Speaker 0: Is this from like the early 90s?

1042
01:23:13,254 --> 01:23:13,795
Speaker 0: And Dr.

1043
01:23:13,815 --> 01:23:19,130
Speaker 0: Blackjack was just video Blackjack against nobody on your computer with Windows 3.1.

1044
01:23:19,130 --> 01:23:21,882
Speaker 0: But it would teach you how to count cards.

1045
01:23:21,962 --> 01:23:23,749
Speaker 0: It just showed you the count the whole time.

1046
01:23:26,150 --> 01:23:32,329
Speaker 0: And so it's like if you read the instructions, you could actually practice counting cards using Dr.

1047
01:23:32,349 --> 01:23:32,830
Speaker 0: Blackjack.

1048
01:23:34,211 --> 01:23:38,770
Speaker 0: And then go to a casino and lose all your money because by the early 90s when this came out, card counting didn't work anymore.

1049
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:39,271
Speaker 1: Yep.

1050
01:23:39,533 --> 01:23:41,668
Speaker 1: But I guess the game itself is...

1051
01:23:41,930 --> 01:23:42,749
Speaker 0: My Chinese food is here.

1052
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:43,352
Speaker 1: Alright.

1053
01:23:43,939 --> 01:23:44,668
Speaker 1: I think we'll just stop.

1054
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:51,558
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1055
01:23:51,598 --> 01:23:56,570
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

1061
01:24:17,721 --> 01:24:20,610
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.

1062
01:24:44,636 --> 01:24:45,810
Speaker 1: I will not say.

1063
01:24:47,031 --> 01:24:51,164
Speaker 1: I recorded this on my gaming headset because it was late and I just finished A Game of Burning Wheel.

1064
01:24:51,245 --> 01:24:52,690
Speaker 1: I didn't want to turn all the stuff back on.

1065
01:24:53,310 --> 01:24:53,851
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

1066
01:24:54,112 --> 01:24:54,794
Speaker 1: Casino games.

1067
01:24:55,175 --> 01:25:01,010
Speaker 1: Let us know what you think of that Lamb cult game and we might do a show on it in the near future.

1068
01:25:01,130 --> 01:26:40,191
Speaker 1: But for now I simply leave you with... [MUSIC].
