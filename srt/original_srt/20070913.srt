1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,646
Speaker 0: It's Thursday September 13th.

2
00:00:12,168 --> 00:00:12,689
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,131 --> 00:00:16,160
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight.

4
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:20,419
Speaker 0: We explain in layman's terms to the best of our ability the Creative Commons.

5
00:00:24,381 --> 00:00:35,953
Speaker 0: Let's do this Man, so now that I got headphones that aren't crappy I've been listening to a lot of podcasts and a lot of music was that?

6
00:00:36,013 --> 00:00:37,900
Speaker 1: maybe that was what was holding you back.

7
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:40,580
Speaker 0: It's the thing is I'm not listening to any more podcast.

8
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:43,616
Speaker 0: I'm just listening to more episodes of the ones I currently listen to.

9
00:00:43,636 --> 00:00:46,800
Speaker 1: yeah But you know I'm not listening to that many podcasts either.

10
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:50,942
Speaker 1: But I you know I have always pretty much kept up with the one with see I do ones I do.

11
00:00:51,023 --> 00:00:53,180
Speaker 0: I did until I stopped driving to work.

12
00:00:53,260 --> 00:01:00,600
Speaker 0: There was kind of this lead time now where I was taking the train to work But I didn't have good headphones, so I read manga and stuff and played GBA games.

13
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,400
Speaker 1: I'll see that was it then is he is my combination of driving or training plus having headphones.

14
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:12,571
Speaker 1: So as any time the podcasts were in the house even at work with the computer at work I was getting the podcast going on.

15
00:01:12,712 --> 00:01:16,357
Speaker 0: so yep, though The thing is I was listening to a podcast.

16
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:16,880
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

17
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:30,820
Speaker 0: They haven't listened to in a while called Derek the Bandit Sound Republic Which I highly recommend if you like trance or any sort of electronic music from South Africa and the world and the letter Z Sound Republic.

18
00:01:33,567 --> 00:01:39,840
Speaker 0: But anyway I I just this stood out so much that I really have to say something about it because it bothered me.

19
00:01:40,543 --> 00:01:47,779
Speaker 0: So he has like kind of ad like things every now And then like blah blah blah he'll talk and I kind of just ignore him like I do any DJ.

20
00:01:48,783 --> 00:01:55,161
Speaker 0: but then in the middle of his mix he played this promo for some podcast and One.

21
00:01:55,201 --> 00:02:00,615
Speaker 0: the audio quality of this promo was really bad and to the podcast sounded really crappy.

22
00:02:00,675 --> 00:02:11,700
Speaker 1: see that's really not so bad when you Read when you've listened to all his episodes because early on in his podcasting days He made a deal with this video game magazine in South Africa now this video game magazine.

23
00:02:12,223 --> 00:02:20,639
Speaker 0: We don't know if it was good or not, but the ads it made The content it was like we're gonna review this game on Derek the Bandit Sound Republic.

24
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:36,760
Speaker 1: the deal He made is he thought that in order to get popular He made a deal with them that they would put his podcast on the CD that came with the magazine and in exchange They would do a small like audio bit like five or ten minutes of video game talk And he would put it in the podcast.

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:46,240
Speaker 1: Terrible really ruined it because you were listening to like this trance mix and then suddenly There's like five to ten minutes of stupid video game guys talking with bad audio.

26
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it wouldn't be so bad because the content wasn't horrible.

27
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,357
Speaker 0: It was just that the audio quality was so terrible that it just I stopped.

28
00:02:53,377 --> 00:02:53,900
Speaker 0: I couldn't listen.

29
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,500
Speaker 0: I just had to stop yep, and then he's doing it again with some crap podcast.

30
00:02:58,641 --> 00:03:01,459
Speaker 1: Well cuz he's sort of part of the pod show thing.

31
00:03:02,061 --> 00:03:07,998
Speaker 1: MTV guy and Dvorak now works over there and their pod safe music network crap.

32
00:03:08,078 --> 00:03:08,700
Speaker 1: and yeah.

33
00:03:09,001 --> 00:03:10,385
Speaker 1: So that's when that's.

34
00:03:10,505 --> 00:03:16,000
Speaker 1: that's where that whole sort of culture of podcasting with the promos and the pod safe music comes from.

35
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,504
Speaker 0: You know more and more.

36
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:22,178
Speaker 0: I just don't like podcasting except my show and a few other shows.

37
00:03:22,198 --> 00:03:24,188
Speaker 1: well It's pretty much like any podcast.

38
00:03:24,228 --> 00:03:26,159
Speaker 1: That's is sort of in with that.

39
00:03:27,872 --> 00:03:30,390
Speaker 1: You know Sort of like podcasting.

40
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,640
Speaker 1: I don't know what you want to call it dogma.

41
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:35,451
Speaker 1: Maybe that those guys have set up it.

42
00:03:35,532 --> 00:03:36,395
Speaker 1: I really don't like it.

43
00:03:36,677 --> 00:03:37,500
Speaker 0: Maybe we should do that.

44
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:40,375
Speaker 0: We should call these different movements like film people and music people do.

45
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,059
Speaker 0: that's dogma.

46
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:43,426
Speaker 0: now Maybe we'll call that dogma.

47
00:03:43,466 --> 00:03:47,180
Speaker 0: and what we do is I don't know awesome, okay?

48
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,864
Speaker 0: Whatever doesn't matter.

49
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:54,337
Speaker 0: I just it stood out so horribly and I mean it stands out in.

50
00:03:54,357 --> 00:04:05,095
Speaker 0: you know other podcasts I listen to when they do it, but the disparity of quality between the normal show if you know awesome music and this promo which sounded like they record over skype was just uh all

51
00:04:05,777 --> 00:04:11,211
Speaker 1: right, so We I got a sports news and a sports thing of the day today.

52
00:04:11,231 --> 00:04:14,038
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah real sports - not like.

53
00:04:14,198 --> 00:04:14,920
Speaker 0: oh, so air hockey?

54
00:04:15,403 --> 00:04:16,892
Speaker 1: No, yeah, exactly ping-pong.

55
00:04:16,973 --> 00:04:18,079
Speaker 0: Yes thumb wrestling.

56
00:04:18,781 --> 00:04:24,562
Speaker 1: So this is probably if you anyone who knows about American football knows everything there is to know about this already But I want to.

57
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:29,819
Speaker 1: I want to bring a new perspective to the table that I have not heard expressed in any other media.

58
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:42,061
Speaker 1: So the New England Patriots a football team that has been quite good this season and many seasons pretty well this season one game So far, but they've been really good for many years, and they're gonna remain being good They're.

59
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,112
Speaker 1: probably they might even win the Super Bowl this year who knows?

60
00:04:44,132 --> 00:04:44,956
Speaker 0: I'll be honest.

61
00:04:45,017 --> 00:04:45,640
Speaker 0: I had no idea.

62
00:04:45,821 --> 00:04:48,252
Speaker 0: I don't even yeah really know what a team is.

63
00:04:48,272 --> 00:04:50,019
Speaker 1: a lot of people who might know that.

64
00:04:50,361 --> 00:04:57,755
Speaker 1: You know my favorite team is the Giants and my second favorite team is the Patriots And my most hated team is the Jets and my second most hated team is the Eagles.

65
00:04:58,096 --> 00:05:00,023
Speaker 1: they might be like ah You're just uh.

66
00:05:00,043 --> 00:05:06,007
Speaker 1: you're just saying what you're about to say because you like the Patriots and you hate the Jets when the game happened To be a Patriots vs.

67
00:05:06,027 --> 00:05:08,018
Speaker 1: Jet game, but no that's not the case.

68
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,627
Speaker 1: cuz rim I think will agree with me.

69
00:05:09,707 --> 00:05:15,194
Speaker 0: despite his not giving two shits about football I care a little bit a family tradition in.

70
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:20,113
Speaker 1: as long as I lie It doesn't count the Lions Lions don't gather night of a football team.

71
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,879
Speaker 1: the law qualifies the football team.

72
00:05:22,782 --> 00:05:25,309
Speaker 0: The thing is there's something special about.

73
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,180
Speaker 0: every Thanksgiving my family sits around and watches the Lions lose.

74
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:30,506
Speaker 0: No, it's not watch them lose.

75
00:05:30,807 --> 00:05:32,395
Speaker 0: It's watch them win.

76
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:39,640
Speaker 0: watch them Just soundly defeat another team and then fuck it up in the last three minutes somehow.

77
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:40,445
Speaker 0: And that was the game.

78
00:05:40,485 --> 00:05:41,410
Speaker 1: that's the New York Giants.

79
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:42,959
Speaker 1: What are you talking about so?

80
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:57,477
Speaker 1: Yeah, so New England Patriots playing the Jets right and in football you have these people on the sidelines the Co-coaches and the coordinators of offense and defense and they have to tell the players what play they want them to do.

81
00:05:57,537 --> 00:06:04,960
Speaker 1: you know do a Do a nickel defense or you know do some you know play action whatever or you know fake this punt, right?

82
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:15,133
Speaker 1: And in order to communicate with the players all right the coach will usually just talk to the quarterback maybe with like a headset something right and Then the quarterback will get in the huddle and tell the team what to do.

83
00:06:15,154 --> 00:06:19,460
Speaker 1: well on defense There is no sort of quarterback on the field to tell everyone what to do.

84
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
Speaker 1: There's just all these sort of equal players.

85
00:06:22,184 --> 00:06:28,558
Speaker 1: So the defensive coordinator on the sidelines You know we'll use some sort of signaling of some sort to tell the defense what to do.

86
00:06:28,658 --> 00:06:32,219
Speaker 1: sometimes You know when they don't have a chance to just you know come over and talk.

87
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:36,312
Speaker 1: So you know of course you're playing a game like this.

88
00:06:36,393 --> 00:06:39,607
Speaker 1: people are gonna look at the other team signals And you know figure them out.

89
00:06:39,627 --> 00:06:50,908
Speaker 1: and sometimes you know you're sitting there playing a game And you might notice hey That's guys done like you know like a tee with his hands and then wiped his brow and every time he did that they Did this defensive play.

90
00:06:51,089 --> 00:06:53,160
Speaker 0: yeah like every time he throws the shocker up?

91
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:53,722
Speaker 0: We know.

92
00:06:53,782 --> 00:06:59,608
Speaker 1: yep, so some you know people notice coincidences like that, and then they'll tell their coach And then they'll get you know a little edge in the game.

93
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:04,209
Speaker 1: the New England Patriots not being complete dumbasses Videotaped the other teams.

94
00:07:05,013 --> 00:07:06,460
Speaker 1: they like apologized for it.

95
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,427
Speaker 1: They did it the cut red-handed whatever.

96
00:07:08,969 --> 00:07:16,775
Speaker 1: they videotaped the other team signals to figure them out And that is against the written rules of the NFL.

97
00:07:16,855 --> 00:07:25,851
Speaker 1: so on the one hand they broke the rules they cheated on paper and They got punished for it, which I guess is the right thing to do.

98
00:07:25,892 --> 00:07:27,579
Speaker 1: you break the rules you face the consequences.

99
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:30,827
Speaker 1: however I don't think that should be against the rules.

100
00:07:31,388 --> 00:07:40,440
Speaker 0: I have to agree any time there is publicly available information Making an arbitrary rule to make this information no longer publicly available arbitrarily.

101
00:07:40,741 --> 00:07:41,765
Speaker 0: I said that twice.

102
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:43,171
Speaker 0: it just there's.

103
00:07:43,231 --> 00:07:47,909
Speaker 0: no I mean they could have gotten this information Cheating like this and not gotten caught.

104
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,720
Speaker 0: hire a hobo to film it and then get the tape from him.

105
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:57,150
Speaker 1: I mean yeah, it's it's really dumb and You know you're basically asking someone.

106
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:57,571
Speaker 1: alright.

107
00:07:57,631 --> 00:08:05,100
Speaker 1: There's a way that you can get an advantage in this game But we're basically going to arbitrarily decide that you cannot you you cannot gain this advantage.

108
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:06,144
Speaker 1: That's standing right in front.

109
00:08:06,184 --> 00:08:10,340
Speaker 0: It's not like we're gonna arbitrarily say you can't carry a spanner with you on the field.

110
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:14,035
Speaker 0: It's like we're gonna arbitrarily say that you can't look at that thing that you're looking at.

111
00:08:14,296 --> 00:08:21,727
Speaker 1: yeah now The real reason I have a problem with this is that basically looking at the signals is not against the rules But videotaping them is well.

112
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:24,680
Speaker 1: Why are they still using signals like this?

113
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:31,697
Speaker 1: Why don't they just install headphones in every player's helmet and have encrypted radio broadcasts from the sidelines?

114
00:08:32,038 --> 00:08:32,700
Speaker 1: end of story.

115
00:08:33,001 --> 00:08:34,847
Speaker 1: No one can possibly break the encryption.

116
00:08:35,128 --> 00:08:36,291
Speaker 1: no videotape is gonna.

117
00:08:36,331 --> 00:08:39,080
Speaker 1: Help you no one could possibly hear what you're telling the players.

118
00:08:39,448 --> 00:08:39,734
Speaker 1: That's it.

119
00:08:40,522 --> 00:08:41,125
Speaker 1: End of story.

120
00:08:41,164 --> 00:08:44,420
Speaker 1: the only thing you could possibly do at that point is to like steal.

121
00:08:44,962 --> 00:08:49,520
Speaker 1: You know the other team's like helmet or something or you don't have a spy on their team.

122
00:08:49,941 --> 00:08:52,147
Speaker 1: You know who's got a job working for them.

123
00:08:52,287 --> 00:08:53,249
Speaker 0: wow you know what.

124
00:08:53,530 --> 00:09:01,840
Speaker 0: having a spy on your rival football team's team is A lot like having a character in an MMO in the enemy guild.

125
00:09:02,404 --> 00:09:04,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know getting caught with that.

126
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:10,938
Speaker 1: That's actually you know pretty serious stuff that connect is not arbitrary to to block you know.

127
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:13,219
Speaker 1: so yeah I think this whole thing is kind of dumb.

128
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,457
Speaker 1: I think that if you know if you don't want people seeing your hand signals don't use stupid hand signals.

129
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:20,580
Speaker 1: technology exists.

130
00:09:20,780 --> 00:09:20,881
Speaker 1: It's

131
00:09:20,921 --> 00:09:33,064
Speaker 0: kind of like when a company opens up an API on the web for something and then as soon as someone uses it for Something they don't like they scream and bitch and piss and moan instead of just not letting the API do things They don't want people to do.

132
00:09:33,325 --> 00:09:33,867
Speaker 0: yep.

133
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:34,409
Speaker 1: Yep.

134
00:09:34,449 --> 00:09:34,569
Speaker 1: Yep.

135
00:09:34,609 --> 00:09:35,773
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

136
00:09:35,874 --> 00:09:37,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, so the EU.

137
00:09:38,562 --> 00:09:39,970
Speaker 0: I'm pretty neutral on the EU.

138
00:09:40,030 --> 00:09:51,800
Speaker 0: I mean I generally thought it was a good idea But at the same I'm not gonna get into my opinion of the EU But a man who is very influential on the EU he is the EU justice and security commissioner.

139
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,499
Speaker 0: His name is Franco Frattini.

140
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,904
Speaker 0: He's from Italy.

141
00:09:56,546 --> 00:10:14,391
Speaker 0: I'll get into him in a second is basically saying that the EU should block from the internet all bomb-making material instructions and furthermore not let people search for terms such as Kill genocide or terrorism.

142
00:10:14,431 --> 00:10:17,380
Speaker 1: wait genocide, so I can't if I have to do a report on

143
00:10:17,967 --> 00:10:29,177
Speaker 0: actually Scott there's already a lot of laws like that in Germany where you just can't talk about Nazis in certain ways and you can't have certain books about him just because They have a lot of laws.

144
00:10:29,721 --> 00:10:31,831
Speaker 1: Yeah, but those laws are mostly.

145
00:10:31,871 --> 00:10:40,120
Speaker 1: I mean I know about those laws and I don't like them And you know they're anti freedom, but a lot of them are specifically to you know block people from being Nazis.

146
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:46,236
Speaker 1: But like you they still learn about Nazis in school, and you can you know still we were all on vacation.

147
00:10:46,337 --> 00:10:47,540
Speaker 1: nothing bad happened.

148
00:10:47,825 --> 00:10:52,307
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly No, basically what this this guy is saying?

149
00:10:52,347 --> 00:10:58,896
Speaker 0: that the EU in order to prevent terror should prevent anyone in the EU from knowing about terrorism.

150
00:10:58,917 --> 00:11:03,280
Speaker 0: oh God this guy this guy it doesn't end there.

151
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:10,300
Speaker 0: I mean this is crazy and I could go on and on about all the details and the stupid things this guy has said but The rabbit holes a little bit deeper.

152
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:16,180
Speaker 0: Apparently this is the same guy who was trying to get rid of violent video games in the EU.

153
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,607
Speaker 1: It's I. how old is this guy?

154
00:11:17,647 --> 00:11:18,351
Speaker 1: I'm betting over 70.

155
00:11:18,351 --> 00:11:23,650
Speaker 1: He was born in 1957. oh, it's not these younger than my mom.

156
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:31,778
Speaker 1: actually he looks like a normal kind of guy But he sounds like a cranky old man who is totally out of touch with the world and doesn't understand things well.

157
00:11:31,818 --> 00:11:33,586
Speaker 1: apparently He doesn't understand security.

158
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,333
Speaker 1: He doesn't understand culture.

159
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:38,104
Speaker 1: He doesn't understand information He doesn't understand technology.

160
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:38,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, well.

161
00:11:38,445 --> 00:11:43,079
Speaker 0: He's the vice president of the European Commission for justice freedom and security and apparently he's against.

162
00:11:43,139 --> 00:11:44,464
Speaker 0: wait He's against freedom.

163
00:11:44,484 --> 00:11:50,504
Speaker 1: He thinks that something that will provide security that won't and He doesn't know the meaning of justice.

164
00:11:51,227 --> 00:11:52,170
Speaker 0: now the even funnier.

165
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:57,960
Speaker 0: I just I looked up the Wikipedia to find out more about this dude and Apparently he's also a Freemason.

166
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:04,200
Speaker 0: Alright, that doesn't mean anything because he was outed as a Freemason by the guy who he replaced.

167
00:12:05,361 --> 00:12:08,370
Speaker 0: It doesn't mean who himself was controversial for some reason.

168
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,055
Speaker 1: uh-huh well this guy.

169
00:12:10,116 --> 00:12:11,600
Speaker 1: I'm thinking is pretty control.

170
00:12:11,741 --> 00:12:12,931
Speaker 1: It's not really controversial.

171
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:13,960
Speaker 1: There is no controversy.

172
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,185
Speaker 1: Well, no the guy is wrong.

173
00:12:15,245 --> 00:12:16,028
Speaker 1: end of story.

174
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,040
Speaker 0: the previous guy was controversial because he was a Roman Catholic.

175
00:12:19,342 --> 00:12:21,673
Speaker 0: So then to get this guy's not Catholic.

176
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:29,616
Speaker 1: He's he's Italian For some obviously not every Italian is Catholic, but a lot most of them are.

177
00:12:29,756 --> 00:12:30,719
Speaker 1: so that's kind of weird.

178
00:12:30,799 --> 00:12:30,940
Speaker 1: well

179
00:12:31,522 --> 00:12:44,952
Speaker 0: Actually the more I read about all these people and there's like this cluster of just weird stupid crazy Politics in the EU and that all kind of like there's the circle jerk of all this and this guy is kind of a spoke Sticking right out of the center of it.

180
00:12:45,214 --> 00:12:57,619
Speaker 1: Yeah Even if a bunch even if the EU is entirely comprised of kooky old men and they all decide this is a good idea It's unenforceable, and maybe they'll give them a fucking wake-up call.

181
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,927
Speaker 0: well You know how they could do it.

182
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:05,060
Speaker 1: they could simply be like China Yeah, and then everyone will just say hey, you're like China, and maybe they'd feel bad.

183
00:13:05,622 --> 00:13:07,468
Speaker 0: I don't think they'd even realize what that meant.

184
00:13:07,488 --> 00:13:11,000
Speaker 0: yeah, but I just like to point out that way back in the day.

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:22,460
Speaker 0: I mean I was online long before I was on the internet And there was a time in my life where I'd log into prodigy or a friend's AOL And I think man I always hear about the internet, but I want to be on it.

186
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,425
Speaker 0: How do I get on it like?

187
00:13:23,465 --> 00:13:25,355
Speaker 0: I wasn't sure how that works me either.

188
00:13:25,716 --> 00:13:26,360
Speaker 0: and one day?

189
00:13:26,901 --> 00:13:41,990
Speaker 0: I got a service and I paid and I was on the internet and my whole family and like all of our friends my grandparents ever were in the house and we're sitting around the computer and I dialed in and I Connected for the first time of anyone in our family to the internet

190
00:13:42,391 --> 00:13:42,832
Speaker 1: mm-hmm

191
00:13:43,133 --> 00:13:52,826
Speaker 0: and the first thing I did was type into the search bar bomb making instructions Because I'd heard that stuff like that was on the internet And I was really curious.

192
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:53,369
Speaker 0: and you know what.

193
00:13:54,032 --> 00:13:59,767
Speaker 0: the first four links were 404s, but the fifth one was a bomb Mm-hmm, and you know what.

194
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:01,960
Speaker 0: I didn't make a bomb and I didn't blow anything up.

195
00:14:02,302 --> 00:14:04,580
Speaker 1: You know at the library you can get the anarchist cookbook.

196
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,395
Speaker 0: Oh, no, the anarchist cookbook recipes mostly are flawed and will kill you.

197
00:14:09,576 --> 00:14:10,178
Speaker 1: I know it's a 10-0.

198
00:14:14,462 --> 00:14:16,250
Speaker 0: Actually a lot of libraries don't carry it either.

199
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,540
Speaker 1: yeah, it was in the library as I was at once.

200
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:19,825
Speaker 0: It's a really shitty book.

201
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:23,880
Speaker 1: It is really shitty, but you know it's infamous, and it's bomb making instructions.

202
00:14:24,543 --> 00:14:26,632
Speaker 0: Oh snap panic everybody.

203
00:14:26,753 --> 00:14:36,556
Speaker 0: save the kids the children Things of the day now.

204
00:14:37,119 --> 00:14:38,565
Speaker 1: I said my news and my thing.

205
00:14:38,585 --> 00:14:40,232
Speaker 1: they were both sports related And they are.

206
00:14:40,914 --> 00:14:46,050
Speaker 0: you know I it's very rare for me to hear the term sports related without hearing the word injury right after that.

207
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:50,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know isn't it like I expected you to say it like today is sports related injury?

208
00:14:50,747 --> 00:14:56,921
Speaker 1: sadly well Or happily depending on your point of view this does not Involve a sports related injury.

209
00:14:56,981 --> 00:14:58,630
Speaker 0: not like back when we had hockey fight week.

210
00:14:59,272 --> 00:15:02,202
Speaker 1: No, so if you've been paying attention at all.

211
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:04,430
Speaker 1: I'm a fan of the Formula One racing.

212
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,887
Speaker 1: There's actually been some crazy stuff going on in the Formula One racing this season.

213
00:15:07,947 --> 00:15:13,290
Speaker 1: You know some Disqualification from the Constructors Cup by McLaren and such and such for craziness.

214
00:15:13,390 --> 00:15:23,835
Speaker 1: But not gonna get into that you may know that the greatest driver of cars To ever live as a human being is a man named Michael Schumacher And he still lives.

215
00:15:24,217 --> 00:15:36,718
Speaker 1: and this is like the first season in a long time Where he has not been an f1 driver, and he won more championships than an f1 that anyone has ever won and More than likely anyone ever will win.

216
00:15:36,939 --> 00:15:39,128
Speaker 0: I mean not only does he live, but he hungers.

217
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,216
Speaker 1: yes I mean sure.

218
00:15:41,236 --> 00:15:44,690
Speaker 1: he often drove a car that was faster than everyone else's car.

219
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:56,310
Speaker 1: But when you look at it You know there was at least one other person each year driving the same car as him And he was always faster than they were and not just like always faster like by a tiny.

220
00:15:56,551 --> 00:15:59,347
Speaker 0: He was always consistently a lot faster.

221
00:15:59,468 --> 00:16:20,640
Speaker 1: right now You might think you know you see someone like Tiger Woods play golf and you see someone like Roger Federer play tennis And they're just so much better than everyone else, but it'd be really interesting, but in some ways also Demystifying and disappointing to use like you know scientific data to figure out exactly Why or how they are so much better than everyone

222
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:20,760
Speaker 0: else.

223
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:34,027
Speaker 0: I mean this is like say you figured out that I'm making this up Obviously, but Lance Armstrong the only reason he was better at bicycling was because by a genetic Whatever one of his ligaments was one centimeter longer than normal or something.

224
00:16:34,047 --> 00:16:34,749
Speaker 1: because his.

225
00:16:34,769 --> 00:16:36,757
Speaker 1: well Yeah, technically he had humongous lungs.

226
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:39,528
Speaker 0: Yeah humongous lungs, and he was has humongous lungs.

227
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:44,110
Speaker 0: He's not dead Yeah, well also there was the fact that I believe he lost one or both testicles.

228
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,374
Speaker 0: I think one to cancer.

229
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:50,650
Speaker 0: so he takes testosterone supplements, but because it was for a medical thing it was legal.

230
00:16:51,134 --> 00:16:52,750
Speaker 1: I think he only took him for some time.

231
00:16:52,792 --> 00:16:53,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, but a lot.

232
00:16:53,290 --> 00:16:56,825
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm not I can't say for sure cuz I don't follow bicycle racing at all.

233
00:16:56,905 --> 00:16:58,150
Speaker 1: it was mostly his huge lungs.

234
00:16:58,311 --> 00:17:00,459
Speaker 1: He was good at bicycling before he yes.

235
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,988
Speaker 0: He was an amazing bicyclist long before all that.

236
00:17:03,028 --> 00:17:06,369
Speaker 1: but anyway You know you always see these people and you wonder what makes them better.

237
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:09,710
Speaker 1: And you look at someone like Michael Schumacher where a lot of it is the car.

238
00:17:10,113 --> 00:17:11,929
Speaker 1: You know not all of it, but a lot of it's the car.

239
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,548
Speaker 1: I mean I could beat him in a race if he had a Ford Pinto, and I had a Ferrari He's not that good.

240
00:17:17,568 --> 00:17:20,261
Speaker 0: well Depends cuz in a race like that you might crash.

241
00:17:20,461 --> 00:17:25,249
Speaker 0: I might I might but regardless He's gonna take that Pinto as fast as it can go.

242
00:17:25,349 --> 00:17:31,706
Speaker 1: he was and probably still is the greatest driver of cars ever and he was faster than everyone else.

243
00:17:31,766 --> 00:17:35,412
Speaker 1: and here's a video that explains in Somewhat.

244
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:41,450
Speaker 1: I guess it's sort of demystifying in a way Because it shows you why he was faster than everyone else.

245
00:17:41,571 --> 00:17:45,030
Speaker 1: And it's kind of sad because now like sort of like the mystique goes away.

246
00:17:45,552 --> 00:17:51,393
Speaker 0: Oh, that's how he did it, and it's not even like a commentary of oh well because of blah and blah and blah Subjective subjective.

247
00:17:51,454 --> 00:18:00,310
Speaker 0: it was like here are the absolute graphs of this and that and that and here yet They use they have something called telemetry which is on all the f1 cars.

248
00:18:00,571 --> 00:18:05,250
Speaker 1: They have all sorts of sensors like monitoring everything in the car like every piece of data.

249
00:18:05,351 --> 00:18:17,610
Speaker 1: They can get about the car the temperatures in different parts of the car the vibrations Exactly how far you're pressing the gas pedal at any time Exactly how much braking you're putting on the temperature of the brakes the temperature of the tires the pressure in the tires.

250
00:18:17,974 --> 00:18:19,250
Speaker 1: You know how much you're steering?

251
00:18:19,790 --> 00:18:21,790
Speaker 1: Everything is measured and sent to a computer.

252
00:18:22,194 --> 00:18:40,550
Speaker 1: so they looked at the Throttle control the brake control and the steering and also the gear shifting of Michael Schumacher driving through the same part of the same racetrack as someone else and Basically he steps on the gas you know more gradually and more controlledly than the other people.

253
00:18:41,132 --> 00:18:48,619
Speaker 1: But at the same time this sort of you know puts the car on edge And he has to make a lot more corrections in his steering.

254
00:18:48,679 --> 00:18:56,150
Speaker 1: so basically he's like steering like a madman and the other guys You know braking a lot more so that he can steer nicely through the turn.

255
00:18:56,611 --> 00:19:02,330
Speaker 1: But as a result Schumacher goes through faster and doesn't lose as much speed and gains the speed right back.

256
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:15,450
Speaker 0: I mean basically the theory of driving a car around a corner fast is simply that There is a there is for any given car in situation an absolute Perfect most optimal way to get a car around a corner.

257
00:19:15,510 --> 00:19:19,186
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean if you go too fast the car will fly off the road and crash and you'll die.

258
00:19:19,206 --> 00:19:21,049
Speaker 0: and if you go too slow You could have gone faster.

259
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:30,646
Speaker 0: There is an absolute physical limit and theoretically if you had enough information you could calculate that limit exactly For every as long as you accounted for every possible.

260
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:36,552
Speaker 1: You know factor Some fact theoretically you can't you know account for like a gust of wind or something like that you know.

261
00:19:36,613 --> 00:19:50,749
Speaker 0: and the primary difference between Like say me going around the corner and a guy who's actually race cars going around the corner if we're both trying to go Around as fast as we can is that the closer you get to that optimal line the less margin for error you have.

262
00:19:50,829 --> 00:19:55,603
Speaker 0: I mean Say, I'm I don't know 20 food units away from the

263
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:56,305
Speaker 1: absolute

264
00:19:56,345 --> 00:20:07,758
Speaker 0: point where my car will spin out And there's no way I can prevent that where I will lose traction no matter what And I can't get closer than that because I don't know how like I'll crash I won't be able to control the car.

265
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,430
Speaker 0: I won't be able to make the fine correction.

266
00:20:09,531 --> 00:20:11,446
Speaker 1: Or you don't have the balls to step on the gas.

267
00:20:11,527 --> 00:20:11,910
Speaker 0: a lot of it.

268
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,770
Speaker 1: You don't have the balls to you know step on the brake half a second later, or it's also.

269
00:20:16,892 --> 00:20:17,770
Speaker 0: I'm not as experienced.

270
00:20:17,891 --> 00:20:23,554
Speaker 0: So if the car goes out of control it takes me longer to react to it And I don't react as well.

271
00:20:23,595 --> 00:20:27,250
Speaker 1: so I need more of especially when the cars go in 200 plus kilometers an hour.

272
00:20:27,632 --> 00:20:35,510
Speaker 0: As a result someone like me needs a much higher Margin of safety where I'll have time to correct and fix my problem and not die.

273
00:20:36,192 --> 00:20:43,664
Speaker 0: Michael Schumacher it drives so close to that edge that you look It's great when you look at the graph of his steering versus the other people.

274
00:20:43,945 --> 00:20:48,341
Speaker 0: the slower people Steer much less like they've got it under control, and they're just going.

275
00:20:48,843 --> 00:20:50,970
Speaker 0: he's so close to crashing at any second.

276
00:20:51,011 --> 00:20:52,408
Speaker 0: He's constantly going left right left.

277
00:20:54,572 --> 00:21:00,790
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's basically wrestling the car to go when he's pushed it to the absolute limit perhaps over the limit of the car.

278
00:21:01,011 --> 00:21:14,650
Speaker 0: I mean the deal is if if the other driver like say had it like sneezed or something They'd have a much better chance of surviving the Michael Schumacher Just because the fact that he's so close to the edge that any disturbance of his car will immediately make him crash.

279
00:21:14,911 --> 00:21:18,261
Speaker 1: Possibly, but he didn't crash so much.

280
00:21:18,281 --> 00:21:19,906
Speaker 1: He didn't crash zero times.

281
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:21,130
Speaker 1: He drove fast.

282
00:21:21,190 --> 00:21:23,358
Speaker 1: I mean they show you him going around this turn right.

283
00:21:23,418 --> 00:21:26,247
Speaker 1: he goes around the turn 0.1 seconds faster than the other guy.

284
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:29,237
Speaker 1: all right 60 laps times.

285
00:21:29,297 --> 00:21:31,604
Speaker 1: how many turns depending on what track they're racing at?

286
00:21:32,026 --> 00:21:36,320
Speaker 1: time is 0.1 seconds He'll finish the race minutes before the other guy.

287
00:21:36,340 --> 00:21:39,069
Speaker 0: the only thing that prevents that is that it's not that easy to pass an f1.

288
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:42,603
Speaker 1: Yeah, well it depends on what year what cars what track.

289
00:21:42,904 --> 00:21:44,250
Speaker 0: modern f1 in general?

290
00:21:44,430 --> 00:21:53,110
Speaker 0: There's not a whole lot of passing except at the very beginning of the race and then but no matter critical What f1 you're talking about it's not easy to pass Michael Schumacher.

291
00:21:54,012 --> 00:21:56,262
Speaker 0: Well, it's pretty much once he passes someone.

292
00:21:56,503 --> 00:21:58,050
Speaker 0: He's immediately on the next guy's ass.

293
00:21:58,371 --> 00:21:59,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that's just it.

294
00:21:59,695 --> 00:22:02,806
Speaker 0: as soon as he passes you you're done, and he ignores you.

295
00:22:02,826 --> 00:22:04,880
Speaker 0: yep Unless there's a pit issue.

296
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:05,324
Speaker 1: actually.

297
00:22:05,445 --> 00:22:13,006
Speaker 1: one other thing I like about this video is at the very beginning they show they have a way They have like a sky cam like you know filming a car driving around the track.

298
00:22:13,026 --> 00:22:13,890
Speaker 0: That was really cool.

299
00:22:14,211 --> 00:22:30,289
Speaker 1: Really, it's very hard when watching a car race on TV to really get the sensation of speed And how fast the cars are going like you watch NASCAR on TV, and it's just like They don't look like they're going that fast.

300
00:22:30,752 --> 00:22:40,936
Speaker 1: I went to see NASCAR in person a long time ago like and I was in middle school or so and It's really fast and f1 is like 50% faster than that.

301
00:22:41,057 --> 00:22:43,404
Speaker 1: it's crazy, but you really can't tell.

302
00:22:43,464 --> 00:22:53,230
Speaker 1: but this video at the very beginning It's it's the best video I've ever seen that really gives you a sensation of how fast they're going because they're going hella fast goddamn.

303
00:22:54,631 --> 00:22:56,787
Speaker 0: So for once I don't have a YouTube video.

304
00:22:56,807 --> 00:23:01,783
Speaker 0: hooray Apparently there's a kind of lion called an Asiatic lion.

305
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:04,814
Speaker 1: I thought you were gonna say a Liger.

306
00:23:05,636 --> 00:23:09,710
Speaker 0: no though there is a store an Asiatic liger.

307
00:23:10,292 --> 00:23:26,966
Speaker 0: When I was living in Michigan in sterling heights a liger actually escapes In the area and for like two weeks They like they had police Watching kids coming home from school and generally patrolling and kids were supposed to stay out of the woods because there was a liger somewhere in sterling heights.

308
00:23:27,816 --> 00:23:31,990
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but anyway, so Asiatic lions are super endangered.

309
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:38,940
Speaker 0: There's like three hundred three hundred and fifty of them left in the world and all of them are in one forest in India mm-hmm.

310
00:23:39,508 --> 00:23:42,762
Speaker 0: and The long story short is that they're still not doing so well.

311
00:23:42,822 --> 00:23:44,830
Speaker 0: and you know poachers are getting them and stuff.

312
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:46,355
Speaker 1: What do they want them for?

313
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:47,278
Speaker 0: I don't know.

314
00:23:47,298 --> 00:24:02,673
Speaker 1: I didn't I didn't I didn't really focus on like I can understand poachers going after Elephants because you can make stuff out of ivory and what I stand poachers going after whales because you can make anything out of Medicine.

315
00:24:02,813 --> 00:24:05,183
Speaker 1: oh right right right yeah, I forgot about that.

316
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:06,568
Speaker 0: see it's one thing.

317
00:24:06,589 --> 00:24:09,690
Speaker 0: no I mean I generally really don't like poaching anyway.

318
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:17,921
Speaker 0: But it's one thing if you kill an animal to make a piano out of its teeth If you kill an animal to make fake medicine out of it.

319
00:24:17,961 --> 00:24:20,670
Speaker 0: That's like it bothers me on multiple levels.

320
00:24:20,791 --> 00:24:24,590
Speaker 0: It's like not only you're doing something stupid, but you're doing it in order to do something stupider.

321
00:24:24,831 --> 00:24:30,370
Speaker 1: It's weird because I really like that aesthetic of like Teddy Roosevelt hunting in Africa safari kind of action.

322
00:24:30,931 --> 00:24:34,984
Speaker 1: But I don't actually like hunting in Africa safari action.

323
00:24:35,325 --> 00:24:37,110
Speaker 0: see at least with the old Livingston.

324
00:24:38,855 --> 00:24:42,225
Speaker 0: I could respect it more when there's a chance that the animal is gonna win and kill you.

325
00:24:42,245 --> 00:24:49,370
Speaker 0: yeah, yeah, definitely Yeah, like I if bullfighting were a 50/50 shot I'd probably be a lot less against bullfighting.

326
00:24:49,491 --> 00:24:54,330
Speaker 0: Great bullfighting is actually kind of dumb to watch and despite I like Hemingway.

327
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,317
Speaker 0: But bullfighting is not cool.

328
00:24:56,357 --> 00:25:00,150
Speaker 0: the way Hemingway tries to make it the aesthetic of bullfighting again is cool.

329
00:25:00,351 --> 00:25:01,576
Speaker 1: Actual bullfighting is lame.

330
00:25:01,637 --> 00:25:03,324
Speaker 1: It should be a fight you versus the bull.

331
00:25:03,365 --> 00:25:03,827
Speaker 1: who wins?

332
00:25:03,867 --> 00:25:09,870
Speaker 1: we don't know I would root for the bull, but anyway, so yeah, you're watching guys get gored is definitely more entertaining.

333
00:25:09,991 --> 00:25:12,148
Speaker 1: Well because they totally deserve it they do.

334
00:25:12,812 --> 00:25:17,189
Speaker 0: Anyway, so uh I I didn't wear those clothes on all that part of the.

335
00:25:17,875 --> 00:25:30,429
Speaker 0: basically the Heart of this issue is that there is little baby tejas And he is a hand-reared Asiatic lion baby that they are raising in order to breed and repopulate the species.

336
00:25:30,449 --> 00:25:33,816
Speaker 0: and There are two pictures of little tejas.

337
00:25:34,237 --> 00:25:45,010
Speaker 0: one is his handler feeding him milk from a bottle and it's adorable and two is him Looking a little bit like our friend Conrad when he wakes up in the morning sitting next to a stuffed tiger.

338
00:25:46,012 --> 00:25:48,109
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, this is so cute.

339
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:53,930
Speaker 0: I would I would give almost anything in the world to be able to pet and play with this little baby line.

340
00:25:53,970 --> 00:25:55,076
Speaker 1: I think it might bite you.

341
00:25:55,256 --> 00:26:00,473
Speaker 0: no it wouldn't because it's really cute and it obviously Actually.

342
00:26:00,533 --> 00:26:11,690
Speaker 0: no, I mean while it wouldn't be domesticated like or domestic atable the way domesticated animals are a Hand-reared lion like that would be generally friendly toward people especially a baby.

343
00:26:11,771 --> 00:26:12,901
Speaker 1: But then how that's the?

344
00:26:12,921 --> 00:26:22,207
Speaker 1: that's the thing I don't understand I guess maybe because I'm not a zoologist, but if your hair if you raise it domestic You know like domesticated like how are you gonna eventually put them back in the wild?

345
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:22,950
Speaker 1: they won't you know?

346
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:23,613
Speaker 1: They won't be the same.

347
00:26:23,633 --> 00:26:24,860
Speaker 0: I'm not sure I believe in this case.

348
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:26,910
Speaker 0: They're not going to put tejas back in the wild.

349
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:28,189
Speaker 0: They're gonna breed tejas.

350
00:26:28,511 --> 00:26:31,344
Speaker 1: So there's gonna have him make a bunch of babies and put them all out in the.

351
00:26:31,364 --> 00:26:32,550
Speaker 1: what put the babies out in the wild?

352
00:26:32,711 --> 00:26:33,313
Speaker 0: Something like that.

353
00:26:33,353 --> 00:26:34,297
Speaker 1: No one to take care of them.

354
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,190
Speaker 0: Well, they probably breed them with wild.

355
00:26:37,271 --> 00:26:38,710
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not sure exactly what they're gonna do.

356
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,018
Speaker 0: All I know is this sort of thing is often successful.

357
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:44,350
Speaker 1: what they should do is they should train them while they're in domestic.

358
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:49,489
Speaker 1: You know domesticated to like, you know eat poachers and then now have like a little.

359
00:26:49,529 --> 00:26:53,223
Speaker 1: you know Like a little stuff Teddy Roosevelt there with the safari hat plus honestly it's a bite him.

360
00:26:53,263 --> 00:27:00,650
Speaker 0: and then what I've read a lot Of the things are actually instinctual and they'll take to the wild much better than you'd expect.

361
00:27:00,991 --> 00:27:15,602
Speaker 0: uh-huh, it's kind of like because they're not bred for domestication like domesticated dogs Actually are that you really can't let them be feral easily because they're so Modified through you know centuries and centuries and centuries of breeding by humans.

362
00:27:16,223 --> 00:27:16,384
Speaker 1: Yep.

363
00:27:17,045 --> 00:27:17,607
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's it.

364
00:27:17,687 --> 00:27:18,670
Speaker 0: These pictures are really cute.

365
00:27:19,134 --> 00:27:20,990
Speaker 0: I expect to see more pictures of baby tejas.

366
00:27:21,311 --> 00:27:26,430
Speaker 1: All right today we're gonna talk about something that a lot of people seem to be confused about.

367
00:27:26,854 --> 00:27:28,590
Speaker 0: Well one person in our forum.

368
00:27:28,631 --> 00:27:40,987
Speaker 1: Well, no No No, cuz see I thought about doing a show on it a while ago and then someone reminded us and I get emails like pretty much Like clockwork every few weeks or so asking about it and people just don't seem to understand.

369
00:27:41,529 --> 00:27:46,563
Speaker 1: or you know They totally don't get what's going on here And I think it requires an episode of explanation.

370
00:27:47,206 --> 00:27:47,970
Speaker 1: and this is what we're gonna do.

371
00:27:47,970 --> 00:27:50,770
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about the Creative Commons that you know.

372
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:58,448
Speaker 1: We know that at the end of our show if you've ever listened all the way to the end We did not just released under Creative Commons 2.5 attribution non-commercial share alike license.

373
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:01,718
Speaker 1: Yes So what the hell is the Creative Commons?

374
00:28:01,858 --> 00:28:05,368
Speaker 0: Alright, basically, maybe we should start with copyright.

375
00:28:05,388 --> 00:28:14,810
Speaker 1: That's what I'm doing Alright, so in the United States and most of the rest of the world also you have copyright Which is a law that prevents creative works from being copied.

376
00:28:14,870 --> 00:28:19,070
Speaker 1: So if you make a song someone else takes that song and copies it and sells that copy.

377
00:28:19,371 --> 00:28:22,783
Speaker 1: They can't do that and the way the copyright law is written right now.

378
00:28:23,386 --> 00:28:24,630
Speaker 0: Is that in the United States?

379
00:28:24,790 --> 00:28:27,561
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk in the United States, but it's also most of the the.

380
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:29,670
Speaker 1: you know, modern world has very similar laws.

381
00:28:29,751 --> 00:28:31,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time look up your own laws.

382
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:35,709
Speaker 0: We can only really speak with any authority about what the way things are in the US.

383
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:43,136
Speaker 1: Yeah but you know the vast majority of Europe is sort of the same way and there's only very small differences usually like in terms of The number of years.

384
00:28:43,156 --> 00:28:45,006
Speaker 0: let's go to China and see how you feel.

385
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:45,770
Speaker 1: very chatty.

386
00:28:45,770 --> 00:28:49,707
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay, but the way it works is let's say rim makes a song rims.

387
00:28:49,727 --> 00:28:55,939
Speaker 1: You made a song Right now without doing anything.

388
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:56,822
Speaker 1: he did nothing.

389
00:28:57,284 --> 00:29:00,715
Speaker 1: that song he just made is Automatically copyrighted.

390
00:29:00,735 --> 00:29:02,785
Speaker 0: Yeah, you don't have to register your copyright.

391
00:29:02,805 --> 00:29:04,773
Speaker 0: You don't have to write a letter you don't have to any.

392
00:29:04,874 --> 00:29:05,476
Speaker 0: all you have to do.

393
00:29:05,938 --> 00:29:14,310
Speaker 0: if you write something down on a piece of paper a short story on a It's copyrighted technically and legally but you might have a harder time defending it in court.

394
00:29:14,576 --> 00:29:20,310
Speaker 1: If you write, you know If you register it That means it'll be easier to defend in court if you ever get sued or want to sue somebody.

395
00:29:20,752 --> 00:29:23,544
Speaker 1: But it's technically by the law copyrighted.

396
00:29:23,584 --> 00:29:29,930
Speaker 1: as soon as you make a creative work If you write a page of a book copyright it automatically make a web page copyright it automatically?

397
00:29:30,151 --> 00:29:30,593
Speaker 1: No, what?

398
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:31,256
Speaker 1: as long as you're?

399
00:29:31,336 --> 00:29:34,229
Speaker 1: as long as you didn't infringe on someone else's copy right when you made it.

400
00:29:34,370 --> 00:29:35,209
Speaker 0: now What does this mean?

401
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:52,363
Speaker 0: I mean, it's actually very simple once you make a work and it is covered and protected by copyright That means that by default No one else in the world has the right to use your work in any way except in a narrow band of exceptions known colloquially as fair use.

402
00:29:53,045 --> 00:29:57,700
Speaker 1: so if I make a song and People want to remix it and I don't do anything.

403
00:29:57,781 --> 00:30:00,170
Speaker 1: I just put my song on an mp3 on the internet, right?

404
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:01,574
Speaker 1: I don't do anything.

405
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:10,670
Speaker 1: They're not allowed to even like download the song technically there, you know, they're not allowed to Frickin play the song, you know at a concert.

406
00:30:10,750 --> 00:30:15,129
Speaker 0: They're not allowed to know by putting it in a public place as as best I know.

407
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:19,328
Speaker 0: There is an implied right to consume it but no right to redistribute it.

408
00:30:19,509 --> 00:30:21,763
Speaker 1: Yes So they can't give a copy of their friends.

409
00:30:21,824 --> 00:30:22,710
Speaker 1: They can't make a remix.

410
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:31,343
Speaker 1: They can't do anything unless I have to give permission in some way, you know I have to do something to give to allow people to do something by default.

411
00:30:31,604 --> 00:30:32,386
Speaker 1: They could do nothing.

412
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:36,523
Speaker 1: so I have to Explicitly say okay, you can use it.

413
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,810
Speaker 1: They have to ask me for permission.

414
00:30:37,890 --> 00:30:44,437
Speaker 1: I have to say something in order for them to be allowed to do something with my art or else It's illegal for them to do anything.

415
00:30:44,798 --> 00:30:47,330
Speaker 0: and I mean there's more complicated bits and pieces.

416
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:50,362
Speaker 0: But that's the gist of it and that's all that matters for our discussion tonight.

417
00:30:50,463 --> 00:30:50,643
Speaker 0: Yep.

418
00:30:51,105 --> 00:30:52,250
Speaker 1: So what is the Creative Commons?

419
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:59,042
Speaker 1: Well right now because the copyright law is the way it is and we don't like it There's still a solution to the problem.

420
00:30:59,082 --> 00:31:00,550
Speaker 1: We want copyright, right?

421
00:31:00,870 --> 00:31:05,230
Speaker 1: I guess ideally to be by default less restrictive than it is.

422
00:31:05,810 --> 00:31:12,890
Speaker 1: However, there's no reason why people who make works of art can't go out and just get rid of these restrictions.

423
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:17,408
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm allowed if I make a work of art, I can just say all the restrictions are gone.

424
00:31:17,508 --> 00:31:21,950
Speaker 0: I can do that Yeah, or I mean just by default you give people nothing and you keep all the rights.

425
00:31:22,010 --> 00:31:24,403
Speaker 0: You might see people say things sometimes like blah blah blah.

426
00:31:24,583 --> 00:31:25,850
Speaker 0: all rights reserved, right?

427
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:30,246
Speaker 1: Well, the point of Creative Commons is that some rights are reserved.

428
00:31:30,286 --> 00:31:38,150
Speaker 1: when you make a work of art You go to the Creative Commons website and you pick out under what terms you want to give away that work.

429
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:42,050
Speaker 1: I mean, let's say I'm willing to have my artwork.

430
00:31:42,371 --> 00:31:47,570
Speaker 1: I made a painting and I'm willing to have people share that painting with the whole world share it with all their friends.

431
00:31:47,871 --> 00:31:48,413
Speaker 1: I don't care.

432
00:31:48,453 --> 00:31:49,256
Speaker 1: they can remix it.

433
00:31:49,296 --> 00:31:53,190
Speaker 1: They can do whatever they want as long as they say that it was by me.

434
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:55,240
Speaker 1: They can't be like, oh, yeah, I'm Joe.

435
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:58,435
Speaker 1: I made this painting that Scott actually made, you know They have to give me credit.

436
00:31:59,078 --> 00:32:08,269
Speaker 1: and if that's all I want I can use a Creative Commons Attribution license and that that basically says I give up all my copyright restrictions except for attribution.

437
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:15,190
Speaker 0: now I believe they've recently or somewhat recently remade is that there's no non attribution license available on the side.

438
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,734
Speaker 1: Well, you can use the public domain.

439
00:32:16,754 --> 00:32:19,280
Speaker 1: You can choose public domain, which means anything goes.

440
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:27,394
Speaker 0: Yeah Then a non attribution Creative Commons Yes But not really not really.

441
00:32:27,655 --> 00:32:34,395
Speaker 1: the point of this is that until now and without Creative Commons if you wanted to do something like this You needed a lawyer.

442
00:32:34,536 --> 00:32:36,566
Speaker 1: if you wanted to use someone else's artwork.

443
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:37,350
Speaker 0: You needed a lawyer.

444
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:38,696
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you might think common sense.

445
00:32:38,857 --> 00:32:45,878
Speaker 0: All right, I'll put my thing up and I'll just say on the website Hey anyone can use this however they want But you can't use it in.

446
00:32:45,898 --> 00:32:59,518
Speaker 0: I don't know Nazi propaganda because I don't like Nazis Because you're not a lawyer and you didn't write that whatever you wrote on your website But perfectly if someone really wanted to break your license They probably could if they had a lawyer.

447
00:33:00,301 --> 00:33:13,988
Speaker 1: at the same time if someone put some you know Someone was using some artwork and let's say they put it on their website and they didn't say anything or they said pretty vague Talking and you know and they didn't have legal text and you went and remixed it thinking that that was okay.

448
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:14,430
Speaker 1: based on what?

449
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:19,370
Speaker 1: They said if they had a lawyer they could probably sue you and get you because it's a copyright infringer.

450
00:33:20,112 --> 00:33:22,517
Speaker 0: Yeah, the issue the deal with Creative Commons is very simply.

451
00:33:23,139 --> 00:33:30,342
Speaker 0: it's a standard way to relinquish or modify many of your inherent Rights to copyright without having to get a lawyer.

452
00:33:30,362 --> 00:33:31,990
Speaker 0: It's a standard boilerplate license.

453
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,682
Speaker 0: You basically say I want to use Creative Commons.

454
00:33:34,963 --> 00:33:36,610
Speaker 0: you pick a bunch of options.

455
00:33:36,811 --> 00:33:50,279
Speaker 0: they're kind of like modules of the Creative Commons and that's it and they give you the shortened version like this is what it means in layman's talk but actually linked from that is the Legal legal legal written by lawyers tested in courts.

456
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,406
Speaker 0: This is the actual license where you're using.

457
00:33:52,567 --> 00:34:00,030
Speaker 1: Yep, and So usually, you know when someone on the internet made something Let's say they make a webcomic and you want to remix the webcomic.

458
00:34:00,312 --> 00:34:02,527
Speaker 1: Usually you're nice and you go and you ask them permission.

459
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:04,197
Speaker 1: you say hey Can I remix your webcomic?

460
00:34:04,238 --> 00:34:06,209
Speaker 1: I get a lot of emails that I'm talking about here.

461
00:34:06,874 --> 00:34:08,969
Speaker 1: Oh, can we put your podcast in our show?

462
00:34:09,178 --> 00:34:11,580
Speaker 1: You know I want to take a piece of geek nights and put it in my pocket.

463
00:34:11,659 --> 00:34:18,750
Speaker 0: at one point Scott had someone asked if they could Use content he made from I think his audio blog way back in the day in a techno song or something.

464
00:34:18,972 --> 00:34:20,583
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that someone does right.

465
00:34:20,603 --> 00:34:21,350
Speaker 1: I forgot about that.

466
00:34:21,471 --> 00:34:26,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just remember that because you told me that I was like wow That was a techno song.

467
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:26,597
Speaker 0: is that?

468
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:27,099
Speaker 1: I don't know.

469
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,469
Speaker 1: I forgot about it, but I'll have to go look for it again.

470
00:34:29,811 --> 00:34:38,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically the Creative Commons is you know by default with the default laws where all rights are automatically reserved Even if you don't want them to be reserved.

471
00:34:38,541 --> 00:34:40,090
Speaker 1: people have to ask permission.

472
00:34:40,591 --> 00:34:45,185
Speaker 1: The point of Creative Commons is that we come out and we say look don't ask permission.

473
00:34:45,426 --> 00:34:51,389
Speaker 1: if you follow these rules You don't have to ask you do not have to ask don't ask me.

474
00:34:51,792 --> 00:34:53,889
Speaker 1: Just read the license and follow the rules.

475
00:34:54,351 --> 00:35:00,890
Speaker 1: Now if you don't want to follow all the rules of the license because you know We have picked an attribution non-commercial derivatives license.

476
00:35:01,412 --> 00:35:04,929
Speaker 1: So let's say you wanted to you remix geek nights in a commercial way.

477
00:35:05,495 --> 00:35:06,990
Speaker 1: I actually share alike not know derivatives.

478
00:35:07,332 --> 00:35:14,723
Speaker 1: But if you wanted to remix geek nights in a non-commercial way You'd have to ask because in a commercial way not in a non-commercial.

479
00:35:14,823 --> 00:35:16,590
Speaker 1: right right God, okay.

480
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:19,243
Speaker 1: So let's talk about what all the different licenses you have to choose.

481
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:20,610
Speaker 1: So I've already talked about attribution.

482
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:22,698
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's that's rim made this.

483
00:35:22,959 --> 00:35:23,180
Speaker 1: Yes.

484
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:26,859
Speaker 1: You can't go around saying yeah this this song It's not by Led Zeppelin.

485
00:35:26,879 --> 00:35:28,170
Speaker 1: It's by Scott Rubin, right?

486
00:35:28,357 --> 00:35:32,590
Speaker 1: Sure You have to give credit where credit is due and other than that you can do whatever you want.

487
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,481
Speaker 1: You can remix tweak, you know.

488
00:35:34,702 --> 00:35:47,888
Speaker 1: add-on take away Share with all your friends do whatever the hell you want with it As long as you give credit where credit is due you have to say, you know That part of the music was by Scott or that panel in my comic is drawn by rim or whatever.

489
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:59,210
Speaker 0: now Non-commercial is another option you can add and it basically says what you might think you can't use this work in a commercial capacity Which actually is not entirely clear-cut.

490
00:35:59,431 --> 00:36:02,664
Speaker 0: I mean, it's hard to say exactly what the line is.

491
00:36:02,704 --> 00:36:04,210
Speaker 0: They're in commercial and non-commercial.

492
00:36:04,351 --> 00:36:09,190
Speaker 1: There is some debate as to exactly what would be commercial and what would not be commercial.

493
00:36:09,190 --> 00:36:15,876
Speaker 1: I mean if I made a song right obviously if you take that song burn it to a CD and sell the CD That's obviously commercial.

494
00:36:16,277 --> 00:36:18,665
Speaker 1: if I make a movie and you sell tickets to see the movie.

495
00:36:18,886 --> 00:36:21,095
Speaker 0: That's obviously commercial All right, but let's say all right.

496
00:36:21,397 --> 00:36:23,690
Speaker 0: I make a song and you put it on your website for free.

497
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:25,078
Speaker 0: All right, that's non-commercial.

498
00:36:25,481 --> 00:36:30,030
Speaker 0: you put it on your website for free But your website happens to include ads unrelated.

499
00:36:31,313 --> 00:36:32,330
Speaker 0: There's a little gray.

500
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:35,929
Speaker 0: Let's say you put it on your website and you have to watch an ad to download it.

501
00:36:36,171 --> 00:36:38,861
Speaker 0: That's real close to being over the line.

502
00:36:38,961 --> 00:36:41,270
Speaker 1: over the line now his he is a really sketchy one.

503
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:44,019
Speaker 1: All right, you make a podcast your podcast.

504
00:36:44,059 --> 00:36:46,307
Speaker 1: you make money from it because you have a sponsor who you know.

505
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:49,850
Speaker 1: every episode you have A sponsor and it costs like 20 bucks to sponsor an episode.

506
00:36:50,432 --> 00:36:54,086
Speaker 1: Now you want to take like 10 minutes of geek nights and put it in your podcast.

507
00:36:54,548 --> 00:36:55,775
Speaker 1: Ooh That's kind of.

508
00:36:55,855 --> 00:36:58,250
Speaker 1: hmm, is that commercial or not?

509
00:36:58,510 --> 00:36:59,005
Speaker 1: I don't know.

510
00:36:59,491 --> 00:37:05,350
Speaker 0: See, I actually I wouldn't worry about that one because that sort of situation is covered by the share alike and no derivatives.

511
00:37:06,275 --> 00:37:06,802
Speaker 1: That is true.

512
00:37:06,863 --> 00:37:07,309
Speaker 1: That is true.

513
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,250
Speaker 0: But that's it.

514
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:13,569
Speaker 0: And the thing is this is one of the biggest myths about Creative Commons that I hear repeated constantly to annoys me.

515
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:21,782
Speaker 0: People always argue don't use the non-commercial because it'll fuck you because no one can use it in their Google Adsense blah blah blah and no one will use your thing.

516
00:37:21,803 --> 00:37:32,782
Speaker 0: and People always seem to be under this misapprehension that if you use a Creative Commons restriction That there's no way anyone can use your work in that capacity.

517
00:37:32,902 --> 00:37:40,644
Speaker 1: and the truth is you can just ask the content creator Yeah, Creative Commons is basically saying don't ask me if you follow these rules.

518
00:37:40,885 --> 00:37:43,214
Speaker 1: if you want to break the rules you can ask That's the default.

519
00:37:43,355 --> 00:37:45,124
Speaker 1: That's the way would be without Creative Commons.

520
00:37:45,144 --> 00:37:48,030
Speaker 1: if there were no Creative Commons You'd have to ask for everything.

521
00:37:48,451 --> 00:37:54,370
Speaker 1: So Creative Commons just says you don't have to ask for these things, but you do have to ask for these things.

522
00:37:54,771 --> 00:38:00,350
Speaker 0: So I think the next one that actually I find this one interesting because it's viral is the share alike clause.

523
00:38:00,591 --> 00:38:02,281
Speaker 1: Right now the share alike thing is tricky.

524
00:38:02,402 --> 00:38:03,629
Speaker 1: the read that I'm gonna explain it.

525
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,319
Speaker 1: The share alike is basically sort of taken from the GPL.

526
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:10,915
Speaker 1: because you know, let's see you a new public license Yes, the canoe public license.

527
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:25,989
Speaker 1: if you make software with a GPL like Linux or Emacs or whatever And you say give that software out right if someone modifies that software then the software the Modifications they make also have to be GPL.

528
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:31,110
Speaker 1: So for example, if we did not have the share alike, right?

529
00:38:31,730 --> 00:38:34,496
Speaker 1: somebody could Take geek nights.

530
00:38:34,877 --> 00:38:36,746
Speaker 1: They're allowed to share it with their friends.

531
00:38:36,907 --> 00:38:37,670
Speaker 1: They give us credit.

532
00:38:38,372 --> 00:38:40,939
Speaker 1: They don't sell it, but they give it to their friends, right.

533
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:47,257
Speaker 1: but they could say give it to their friends with a BSD license or something.

534
00:38:47,819 --> 00:38:51,290
Speaker 1: or they could say make a remix of geek nights, right?

535
00:38:51,730 --> 00:38:57,515
Speaker 1: But the remix of geek nights they could distribute under Some other kind of an Apache like.

536
00:38:57,535 --> 00:39:09,309
Speaker 0: think of this if we didn't have non-commercial then theoretically they could take geek nights Remix it put it on a CD and sell it and we would not have the right to take the remix back and use it.

537
00:39:09,971 --> 00:39:23,010
Speaker 1: Because basically share alike says if you want to make a remix of this right or a derivative work Then your derivative work also has to be creative commons or similar, you know similar enough to our lice.

538
00:39:23,090 --> 00:39:32,707
Speaker 0: it pretty much means the license you distributed under has to at least be as Set up like as good as free as the one I distributed under.

539
00:39:32,727 --> 00:39:34,681
Speaker 0: so you can go more free but you can't go less free.

540
00:39:35,024 --> 00:39:39,724
Speaker 1: Yep, and Basically prevents, you know the non-commercial from being kind of silly.

541
00:39:39,764 --> 00:39:42,639
Speaker 1: because if you say okay You can't you know, take this and set.

542
00:39:42,699 --> 00:39:44,630
Speaker 1: if you say attribution non-commercial, right?

543
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:52,677
Speaker 1: Someone can't just take your podcast and sell it but or your book and just sell it but they could take your book Remix it and sell the remix.

544
00:39:53,139 --> 00:39:56,793
Speaker 1: So share alike says alright if you want to remix this or some Well, I don't know.

545
00:39:56,873 --> 00:39:57,738
Speaker 0: it'd be tricky if they could.

546
00:39:57,818 --> 00:39:59,508
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know exactly if they could sell it.

547
00:40:00,492 --> 00:40:09,546
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of sketchy but share alike basically what they could do is make a really weird thing about your with your music And then you wouldn't have the right to take it back and use it for something else.

548
00:40:09,707 --> 00:40:15,092
Speaker 0: Yep, and People tend to use the two in tandem the two options, so it doesn't really matter It doesn't?

549
00:40:15,313 --> 00:40:26,811
Speaker 1: the other point of share alike is that it sort of spreads the Creative Commons love Because people are all remixing cool Creative Commons stuff and then it sort of forces them to also Creative Commons their stuff Which.

550
00:40:26,851 --> 00:40:31,525
Speaker 1: and then people use that and Creative Commons that and it spreads the love all around.

551
00:40:32,208 --> 00:40:32,649
Speaker 1: you know, hope.

552
00:40:32,729 --> 00:40:33,849
Speaker 0: hence I said it was viral.

553
00:40:34,081 --> 00:40:42,704
Speaker 1: Yep And all the all the art in the whole world if it keeps being remixes of one another will eventually all be Creative Commons and cool No matter what the copyright laws.

554
00:40:43,269 --> 00:40:43,370
Speaker 0: now.

555
00:40:43,530 --> 00:40:49,030
Speaker 0: Another one that some people use particularly commercial works is the no derivatives option.

556
00:40:49,532 --> 00:40:51,783
Speaker 1: The thing with the no derivatives option is pretty simple.

557
00:40:52,225 --> 00:40:54,330
Speaker 0: Don't remix this Yeah, don't alter it.

558
00:40:54,370 --> 00:41:04,242
Speaker 0: Like if we use the no derivatives you could spread geek nights around give it to friends do whatever you wanted in terms of giving It to people but you couldn't modify it in any way.

559
00:41:04,262 --> 00:41:06,690
Speaker 0: You'd have to give the exact file that we gave out.

560
00:41:06,790 --> 00:41:10,210
Speaker 1: Yeah, you couldn't like add like a little bumper to the beginning of it.

561
00:41:10,230 --> 00:41:11,690
Speaker 1: You couldn't add audio to the end of it.

562
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:16,230
Speaker 1: You couldn't cut out like a single second of geek nights and distribute like, you know, the shortened version.

563
00:41:16,451 --> 00:41:22,710
Speaker 1: You couldn't re-encode geek nights into a smaller mp3 and give that out because you've modified the work tech.

564
00:41:22,791 --> 00:41:25,295
Speaker 0: I guess technically yeah I want podcast that.

565
00:41:25,375 --> 00:41:36,330
Speaker 0: or put two podcasts that use this or escape pod and pseudopod because they tell stories From a commercial market, but they release their podcast which has these stories in them under a no derivatives license.

566
00:41:36,631 --> 00:41:44,110
Speaker 0: So you can share the stories in their completeness, but you can't use bits and pieces from the stories or these readings and other projects.

567
00:41:44,472 --> 00:41:46,930
Speaker 1: Yep, I think that's definitely a good license for them.

568
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,352
Speaker 1: Yes, now the hard part is choosing which license is right for you And you know what?

569
00:41:52,255 --> 00:41:54,502
Speaker 1: It totally depends on what you're doing and the website.

570
00:41:54,542 --> 00:41:57,210
Speaker 1: the creative commons website really helps you out in picking which one.

571
00:41:57,430 --> 00:42:05,719
Speaker 1: And you can use almost any combination of the four things we have talked about, you know You can have a an attribution share alike.

572
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:08,647
Speaker 1: You can have an attribution no derivatives.

573
00:42:08,907 --> 00:42:17,829
Speaker 1: You can have a Attribution non-commercial no derivatives, you know, you can do all sorts of different crazy stuff and it's totally up to you Whatever works best for what you're doing.

574
00:42:18,552 --> 00:42:25,110
Speaker 1: Now they have some other licenses that are special that you're probably not going to use because they're mostly for special case.

575
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:27,845
Speaker 0: I like the developing nations the developing nations.

576
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:36,050
Speaker 1: one is very interesting Now the way the world works right is that if you are already a developed nation like the United States, right?

577
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:43,110
Speaker 1: Intellectual property law helps you because you are generating a lot of copyrighted works and you want to make a lot of money off of them.

578
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:44,348
Speaker 1: So you don't want people pirating them.

579
00:42:44,831 --> 00:42:48,850
Speaker 1: But if you're a poor country, right and you don't you're not generating a lot.

580
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:58,259
Speaker 1: You don't have like research scientists or lots of you know, musicians and things and you're mostly you know getting your you know Copyrighted works from other places in the world, you know, you're not.

581
00:42:58,379 --> 00:43:05,387
Speaker 1: you're getting importing books and importing movies and such Copyright law sort of sucks for your country because it makes it.

582
00:43:05,729 --> 00:43:14,507
Speaker 1: you know You can't afford to get all these works of art and you're not producing that many and your country really can't get ahead in the world Because the copyright law is holding you down.

583
00:43:14,528 --> 00:43:24,070
Speaker 1: and You can see a lot of countries like look at China Pirating like crazy pirating like crazy pirating like crazy and that helped them get way up there, you know, China's moving along.

584
00:43:24,150 --> 00:43:25,700
Speaker 1: It's not great, but it's moving along.

585
00:43:25,821 --> 00:43:34,724
Speaker 0: Well in largely due to piracy Yeah, especially of software in the race between India and China to join the like super industrialized world I think China's gonna like up.

586
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:35,109
Speaker 0: they do.

587
00:43:35,712 --> 00:43:42,742
Speaker 1: But notice as China gets closer and closer to having their leg all the way up They start putting on the intellectual property.

588
00:43:42,782 --> 00:43:48,529
Speaker 1: because they start, you know realizing Hey, you know, we've pirated so many copies of Windows to get where we are.

589
00:43:48,951 --> 00:43:55,570
Speaker 1: But now it would be better off for us because we're you know, we have money now to actually not let people pirate windows.

590
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:57,703
Speaker 1: so maybe Microsoft China can make some money.

591
00:43:58,729 --> 00:44:03,141
Speaker 1: and the developing nations license is sort of like a recognition of this problem.

592
00:44:03,883 --> 00:44:09,821
Speaker 1: and one thing I know that was licensed this way was Cory Doctorow's like books at least one or two of them.

593
00:44:10,102 --> 00:44:15,209
Speaker 1: and the way it works is you make a book say and You put the developing nations license on there.

594
00:44:15,493 --> 00:44:24,304
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into all the details But basically the book is not free in some place like the United States But the book is totally free and like the Congo.

595
00:44:24,867 --> 00:44:34,080
Speaker 1: so that way Developing nations who need more works of art and you know can't really afford they need to get ahead in the world Can freely access and distribute your art.

596
00:44:34,542 --> 00:44:40,469
Speaker 1: but places where people aren't poor And they have plenty of money to buy books have to buy your book and they can't just be sharing it.

597
00:44:41,115 --> 00:44:41,949
Speaker 1: And it's pretty cool.

598
00:44:42,452 --> 00:44:47,297
Speaker 1: I don't think it apply, you know, it doesn't apply to too many works of art But it does.

599
00:44:47,338 --> 00:44:49,570
Speaker 1: it applies to quite a few and I think it's really interesting.

600
00:44:50,256 --> 00:44:51,408
Speaker 1: You want you want to go over the other ones?

601
00:44:52,210 --> 00:44:52,772
Speaker 0: Not too much.

602
00:44:53,295 --> 00:44:59,581
Speaker 0: I don't want to bore anyone plus remember and we should probably say this and stress it very much We know jack and shit about laws.

603
00:44:59,621 --> 00:45:00,566
Speaker 0: We are not lawyers.

604
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:07,327
Speaker 1: Yep There's I think there's one that that basically says I'm going to follow the copyright law.

605
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:12,422
Speaker 1: the founders copyright one Which says I'm going to follow the original copyright law of the United States.

606
00:45:12,723 --> 00:45:13,385
Speaker 1: the founders got.

607
00:45:13,445 --> 00:45:14,709
Speaker 0: I like that one just for.

608
00:45:14,849 --> 00:45:17,216
Speaker 1: so it Basically, it says yeah, I'm gonna do.

609
00:45:17,236 --> 00:45:28,647
Speaker 1: you know, this is copyrighted in full but 14 or 28 years from now It's gonna be public domain Instead of you know, what 90 years after you die something like that 75 years after you die.

610
00:45:28,667 --> 00:45:29,590
Speaker 0: I don't even know anymore.

611
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:39,701
Speaker 1: Yeah, so basically says this is copyrighted and for real the whole thing You can't do anything with it without permission, but 14 years from now You'll be able to do whatever you want with no restrictions at all.

612
00:45:39,741 --> 00:45:41,046
Speaker 1: That's the way it was back in the 1800s.

613
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:44,410
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean anyway to sum up we're not lawyers.

614
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:44,972
Speaker 0: That was just.

615
00:45:45,273 --> 00:45:53,221
Speaker 0: we were trying to explain this mostly because a lot of people ask us to use geek nights all the time And the answer is it's all Creative Commons.

616
00:45:53,261 --> 00:45:55,310
Speaker 0: Just look at our license and follow those rules.

617
00:45:55,492 --> 00:45:57,110
Speaker 1: Yes, you only have to follow three rules.

618
00:45:57,170 --> 00:45:59,240
Speaker 1: You have to say it was geek nights and give us credit.

619
00:45:59,742 --> 00:46:01,550
Speaker 1: You can't make any money by using it.

620
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:05,104
Speaker 1: You know, you don't want someone else getting rich off geek nights before we do.

621
00:46:05,124 --> 00:46:07,674
Speaker 1: and if you're gonna you know Share it with people.

622
00:46:08,016 --> 00:46:09,522
Speaker 1: You got to share it with the coolness.

623
00:46:09,542 --> 00:46:11,530
Speaker 1: You can't be sharing it with the assholiness.

624
00:46:12,430 --> 00:46:12,772
Speaker 1: That's it.

625
00:46:13,233 --> 00:46:13,815
Speaker 1: Don't know?

626
00:46:13,856 --> 00:46:16,144
Speaker 1: one should ask me permission unless they want to break one of these rules.

627
00:46:16,585 --> 00:46:16,886
Speaker 0: granted.

628
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:17,830
Speaker 0: We're pretty open to that.

629
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:22,270
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, if you ask permission, I'll probably say yes depending on what you're doing.

630
00:46:22,350 --> 00:46:23,174
Speaker 1: There's very little.

631
00:46:23,234 --> 00:46:26,186
Speaker 0: someone could say they want to do with our show that we would say no to.

632
00:46:26,327 --> 00:46:26,869
Speaker 1: it's just we.

633
00:46:26,889 --> 00:46:29,303
Speaker 1: you know If you're doing something that breaks these rules, I just want to know.

634
00:46:29,323 --> 00:46:30,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want it.

635
00:46:30,510 --> 00:46:31,890
Speaker 1: I don't want you doing it without asking.

636
00:46:32,671 --> 00:46:35,664
Speaker 1: So yeah, anyone who has failed to understand the Creative Commons.

637
00:46:35,744 --> 00:46:44,003
Speaker 1: Thanks to our very terse You know, I guess possibly inaccurate possibly inaccurate Discussion that we have at the end of every episode.

638
00:46:44,044 --> 00:46:52,146
Speaker 1: if that's not enough for you You should understand now and if you don't understand now You go to the creative commons org website and then you will fully understand.

639
00:46:52,186 --> 00:46:54,796
Speaker 0: if you still don't understand I guess just email Lawrence Lessig.

640
00:46:55,097 --> 00:46:56,582
Speaker 1: Yeah, he's not doing that anymore.

641
00:46:56,602 --> 00:46:58,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, he could probably still give you an earful.

642
00:46:59,312 --> 00:47:01,809
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't think he would though you got other things to do.

643
00:47:02,031 --> 00:47:04,630
Speaker 1: Well, he's working on fighting corruption instead of copy right now.

644
00:47:05,310 --> 00:47:10,588
Speaker 1: And I guess joy Ito isn't is in sort of in charge of the Creative Commons now Which is all he's also a good guy.

645
00:47:11,292 --> 00:47:18,898
Speaker 1: But yeah, you can watch plenty of videos of Lawrence Lessig on YouTube that are Creative Commons licensed Explaining the Creative Commons like they're.

646
00:47:18,938 --> 00:47:20,786
Speaker 0: actually he's a pretty fascinating guy.

647
00:47:20,806 --> 00:47:21,890
Speaker 0: I'd recommend you learn about him.

648
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:24,923
Speaker 1: Yeah, Lawrence Lessig is a really awesome like lawyer guy.

649
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:26,430
Speaker 1: He's like a lawyer hero.

650
00:47:27,334 --> 00:47:29,485
Speaker 0: All right, and one final note.

651
00:47:29,505 --> 00:47:34,730
Speaker 0: I think we're done for tonight But I just like to warn everyone that the beta of Team Fortress 2 comes out next week.

652
00:47:35,791 --> 00:47:37,796
Speaker 0: I hope geek nights will still be around.

653
00:47:37,877 --> 00:47:45,670
Speaker 1: it is in your best interest to petition valve to have this game like destroyed because Otherwise it is likely this game will destroy geek night.

654
00:47:46,874 --> 00:47:51,748
Speaker 1: You have to decide between Team Fortress 2 and geek nights that that that might be the.

655

Speaker 0: tell you what Scott.
