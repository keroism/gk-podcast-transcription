1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:10,500
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, August 3rd, 2011.

2
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:10,761
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:12,770
Speaker 0: And I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:14,237
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,298 --> 00:00:16,329
Speaker 1: Tonight, anime we should see.

6
00:00:18,217 --> 00:00:18,828
Speaker 0: We want to see.

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,658
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:26,754
Speaker 1: Ah, it's so sad.

9
00:00:26,894 --> 00:00:30,270
Speaker 1: Second year in a row this past weekend was Otacon and we weren't there.

10
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:31,128
Speaker 1: It was weird.

11
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:36,930
Speaker 1: It was still, to this day, two years in a row, it is weird to not be at Otacon.

12
00:00:37,491 --> 00:00:44,490
Speaker 1: Even though almost no one I know went except for, like, you know, Anime World Order and Mike Tool and all them.

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:47,702
Speaker 1: And, like, a tiny handful of the crew.

14
00:00:47,763 --> 00:00:49,510
Speaker 1: Almost everyone else also bailed on it, so.

15
00:00:50,512 --> 00:00:51,643
Speaker 0: People seem to follow us.

16
00:00:51,704 --> 00:00:52,290
Speaker 0: They're followers.

17
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:55,810
Speaker 0: Plus, you know, most of the people, they're not into the, you know, the anime.

18
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,568
Speaker 0: If you're not, you know, like us, doing a bunch of stuff at the anime convention, it doesn't really have anything for you as much, right?

19
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,279
Speaker 1: The thing is, it could.

20
00:01:03,299 --> 00:01:04,006
Speaker 1: It just doesn't.

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,732
Speaker 0: Otacon actually does.

22
00:01:05,932 --> 00:01:16,730
Speaker 0: If I didn't live in New York with no car anymore, you know, if I was still in Beacon with a car, or maybe even further south with a car, or something like that, I would probably still go to Otacon.

23
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,670
Speaker 1: Would you stand in that line?

24
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:20,253
Speaker 0: Maybe.

25
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:21,219
Speaker 0: It's tough, right?

26
00:01:21,239 --> 00:01:23,270
Speaker 0: Because it also depends on the hotel and all that stuff.

27
00:01:23,350 --> 00:01:30,290
Speaker 0: But it's like, if Otacon was a little more convenient, I want to go because it's actually one of the only anime cons that has stuff I actually want to see.

28
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,550
Speaker 0: Like, you know, the movies and the Japanese guests and whatever.

29
00:01:33,650 --> 00:01:38,490
Speaker 1: Of course, what saddens me is that the stuff I want to see currently is not what anyone else wants to see.

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:38,988
Speaker 1: That's good!

31
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:45,430
Speaker 1: I heard tell from multiple sources that after the Makoto Shinkai movie, there was a Makoto Shinkai-like panel.

32
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:48,398
Speaker 1: And almost everybody walked out.

33
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:49,464
Speaker 1: They didn't care about him.

34
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:50,610
Speaker 1: They just wanted to see the premiere.

35
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,245
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you know, at least they saw his movie.

36
00:01:53,265 --> 00:01:53,910
Speaker 0: It's better than nothing.

37
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the Trigun movie, people said it was okay.

38
00:01:57,851 --> 00:01:58,397
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

39
00:01:58,417 --> 00:01:59,589
Speaker 0: I wasn't there, so I don't know.

40
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:00,975
Speaker 1: Yep, I don't know exactly.

41
00:02:01,236 --> 00:02:04,630
Speaker 1: At least Daryl got to run Anime as Crazy as Deaths.

42
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:06,317
Speaker 0: I'm sure it was 100% packed house completely.

43
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:09,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, absolutely.

44
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:09,948
Speaker 0: Yeah.

45
00:02:10,990 --> 00:02:12,168
Speaker 1: I would have gone to that had I been there.

46
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:14,749
Speaker 0: I would have attempted to as well.

47
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:16,194
Speaker 1: Yeah.

48
00:02:16,576 --> 00:02:19,830
Speaker 1: I feel like it would take such a little effort to make Otacon almost twice as good.

49
00:02:20,010 --> 00:02:21,195
Speaker 0: Yeah, but here's the thing.

50
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:24,730
Speaker 0: By my count, Otacon actually had a huge attendance jump this year.

51
00:02:25,152 --> 00:02:25,961
Speaker 0: To 31,000, they said?

52
00:02:26,082 --> 00:02:26,770
Speaker 0: Something like that?

53
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,770
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't even check the official numbers yet, but they did.

54
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,500
Speaker 1: Now that they have the Hilton, they have a much higher cap.

55
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, they raised their number.

56
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:39,290
Speaker 0: I think now, by my numbers, they might be bigger than the San Diego Comic-Con.

57
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:42,523
Speaker 0: Because the San Diego Comic-Con has a number of like 140,000.

58
00:02:42,523 --> 00:02:43,990
Speaker 0: Some ungodly number, right?

59
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:48,066
Speaker 0: But you don't realize, San Diego Comic-Con starts Wednesday night.

60
00:02:48,147 --> 00:02:48,890
Speaker 0: It's preview night.

61
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:50,850
Speaker 0: Then it's Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday.

62
00:02:51,153 --> 00:02:51,942
Speaker 1: So, think about this.

63
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:52,569
Speaker 1: They do turnstile.

64
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,317
Speaker 0: They are multiplying that number.

65
00:02:54,357 --> 00:02:57,190
Speaker 0: That number divided by five is the real number.

66
00:02:57,490 --> 00:03:02,750
Speaker 0: Now, granted, when you look at videos of San Diego, the lines are way longer than Otacon lines.

67
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:06,270
Speaker 1: But there are fewer headlining events that are concurrent.

68
00:03:06,751 --> 00:03:09,541
Speaker 0: And the crowds are packed much more densely.

69
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,990
Speaker 0: But I think, I haven't been there, so I don't know.

70
00:03:12,511 --> 00:03:14,919
Speaker 0: San Diego is mostly one big room.

71
00:03:14,999 --> 00:03:17,890
Speaker 0: Imagine if everyone at Otacon was in the dealer's room the whole time.

72
00:03:18,411 --> 00:03:25,230
Speaker 0: Sure as fuck, even if that dealer's room was two or three times as big, you could be sure as hell that it would be as crowded as San Diego, right?

73
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:28,530
Speaker 0: But the people at Otacon are spread out over a much wider space.

74
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:35,338
Speaker 0: Also, you see those gigantic lines to see incredibly famous people in the infamous Hall H. Or there's a ballroom also.

75
00:03:35,358 --> 00:03:37,950
Speaker 0: that's like the second most popular room.

76
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,844
Speaker 0: But Otacon has seven panel rooms, right?

77
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:46,850
Speaker 0: I think there's some ungodly number of panel rooms and some seven video rooms.

78
00:03:47,170 --> 00:03:49,029
Speaker 0: And they're gigantic and there's so many of them.

79
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,850
Speaker 0: From what I've never been to San Diego, I could be wrong.

80
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:58,710
Speaker 0: From what I've heard other people talking about, it seems like they pretty much have the two gigantic panel rooms for famous shit and then a bunch of small ones.

81
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:09,050
Speaker 0: So, I'm actually gonna say that by my count, as of now, Otacon is the biggest geek convention in the United States.

82
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,770
Speaker 0: Possibly the world.

83
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:14,567
Speaker 1: There's a reason why, when PAX was like, "Yeah, we're gonna have PAX

84
00:04:14,668 --> 00:04:14,829
Speaker 1: East."

85
00:04:15,191 --> 00:04:15,855
Speaker 1: And they were like,

86
00:04:15,915 --> 00:04:16,519
Speaker 1: "Boston?"

87
00:04:16,559 --> 00:04:17,101
Speaker 1: We were like,

88
00:04:17,384 --> 00:04:17,485
Speaker 1: "Eh.".

89
00:04:19,671 --> 00:04:23,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I would go to Otacon if I wasn't doing anything, if it was a little bit more convenient.

90
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,410
Speaker 0: That's just my personal situation.

91
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but simultaneously, it's kind of like everything's going well for now.

92
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,830
Speaker 0: It's like they could be even better with the smallest amount of effort.

93
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,593
Speaker 0: It's so simple.

94
00:04:34,774 --> 00:04:38,950
Speaker 1: Just redo the screening rooms to have people actually talking about the stuff.

95
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:39,688
Speaker 0: Mail badges.

96
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,170
Speaker 1: Mail the badges and have a keynote.

97
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,270
Speaker 1: Just have, you know, you've got Makoto Shinkai, get him to do a keynote.

98
00:04:46,932 --> 00:04:48,665
Speaker 1: Get Mike Toole to do a keynote.

99
00:04:48,725 --> 00:04:49,290
Speaker 1: Get someone.

100
00:04:49,510 --> 00:04:50,154
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

101
00:04:50,878 --> 00:04:52,970
Speaker 0: Get the first con chair of Otacon ever.

102
00:04:53,713 --> 00:04:54,790
Speaker 0: The person's not dead, right?

103
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,380
Speaker 1: Jim Voll should do it, actually.

104
00:04:56,420 --> 00:04:58,533
Speaker 1: He's probably one of the more important- I don't know.

105
00:04:58,553 --> 00:05:01,950
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's a great guy, but I don't know what his public speaking skills are like.

106
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:03,410
Speaker 1: I think he would do okay.

107
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:08,288
Speaker 0: I'm sure he could do just fine, but, you know, it's like, is he, you know, an amazing public speaker?

108
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,010
Speaker 0: I haven't heard him public speak.

109
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:17,170
Speaker 1: Otacon gets the A-list of Japanese guests, and yet hardly anyone cares to even see them, except to get autographs signed.

110
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:18,990
Speaker 1: Or if they're American voice actors.

111
00:05:19,170 --> 00:05:21,110
Speaker 0: I would just not bring the non-Japanese guests.

112
00:05:21,270 --> 00:05:25,772
Speaker 1: No, I would bring them anyway, but I'd bring a little bit less, and more importantly, I would do.

113
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:39,290
Speaker 1: the one thing that the New York Anime Festival did well, if you forget the fact that they didn't actually have a translator, is, you know, they sell this big keynote thing, and they promoted the ever-living fuck out of the fact that they had Japanese guests,

114
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:39,914
Speaker 0: and they

115
00:05:39,975 --> 00:05:40,788
Speaker 1: packed that room.

116
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:41,429
Speaker 0: They sure did.

117
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,030
Speaker 1: There is no excuse for Otacon not packing the room of at least Makoto Shinkai.

118
00:05:46,432 --> 00:05:48,650
Speaker 0: I think Otacon pushes a musical guest harder.

119
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,590
Speaker 0: Wait, what was Otacon's musical guest this year?

120
00:05:51,094 --> 00:05:52,249
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

121
00:05:53,410 --> 00:05:53,830
Speaker 1: Chemistry.

122
00:05:54,470 --> 00:05:55,190
Speaker 0: Who's chemistry?

123
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:55,933
Speaker 0: I don't know.

124
00:05:55,953 --> 00:06:02,850
Speaker 0: I'll be honest, I kind of stopped paying attention after- But the thing was, Otacon had huge musical guests for multiple years in a row.

125
00:06:03,214 --> 00:06:03,723
Speaker 0: TMR, right?

126
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,970
Speaker 0: And then, you know, chemistry may or may not be big, but I haven't heard of them.

127
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:12,210
Speaker 1: Of course, we're kind of disconnected from that scene.

128
00:06:12,690 --> 00:06:13,005
Speaker 0: That's true.

129
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:14,630
Speaker 1: I mean, we used to be much more into the anime.

130
00:06:14,971 --> 00:06:18,770
Speaker 0: I imagine they did the opener to some anime that's really popular that we don't watch.

131
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:25,409
Speaker 1: I mean, remember back in the day when the rumors, I'd always hear people, even at RIT, being like, "Yeah, I heard Otacon got 2 Mix next

132
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:25,610
Speaker 1: year.".

133
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm still waiting for the 2 Mix Ayumi.

134
00:06:29,933 --> 00:06:31,105
Speaker 1: Oh my god, 2 Mix Ayumi Megumi.

135
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:37,230
Speaker 0: I don't think one of those girl groups like AKB48 or Morning Musume or Girls' Generation or some shit.

136
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:39,110
Speaker 1: That would probably generate a pretty big crowd.

137
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:40,090
Speaker 0: That would explode.

138
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,537
Speaker 1: And the thing is- It'd be like, "Yeah, guess what?

139
00:06:42,557 --> 00:06:44,007
Speaker 0: We're not bringing a musical guest like a band.

140
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,474
Speaker 0: We're bringing 48 girlies.

141
00:06:45,494 --> 00:06:45,976
Speaker 0: Watch

142
00:06:45,996 --> 00:06:46,116
Speaker 0: out.".

143
00:06:49,710 --> 00:06:57,169
Speaker 1: They'd have to do a Japanese-style talk show, like have a room where it's them poking at cats or whatever it is they make them do on TV.

144
00:06:57,493 --> 00:06:57,842
Speaker 0: I don't know.

145
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,989
Speaker 1: But yeah, if you guys wanted us at Otacon, tell them.

146
00:07:03,711 --> 00:07:13,309
Speaker 1: If you were at Otacon and you saw good panels like Mike Tools or Daryl Sarats or Geralds or Clarissas, they have a forum where you can tell them what was a good panel.

147
00:07:14,611 --> 00:07:24,222
Speaker 1: And most importantly, the excuse that Otacon gave years in a row when we tried to get them to get Super Art Fight, which is one of the most amazing performance art.

148
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:26,030
Speaker 1: that is competitive art.

149
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,950
Speaker 0: Literal drawing, two-dimensional art I've ever seen.

150
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,961
Speaker 0: It would be epic at Otacon or PAX.

151
00:07:31,383 --> 00:07:32,610
Speaker 0: Right now, it's epic at Kinetacon.

152
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:35,110
Speaker 0: It's like, "Hey, there's a great reason to come to Kinetacon.

153
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:38,707
Speaker 0: We've got Super Art Fight, which is the highest class event that isn't at the real

154
00:07:38,748 --> 00:07:39,230
Speaker 0: conventions.".

155
00:07:39,230 --> 00:07:47,328
Speaker 1: For years, before we were staff on Otacon, when we were staff on Otacon, and after we quit being staff on Otacon, we were like, "Get Super Art

156
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:47,549
Speaker 1: Fight.".

157
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:49,190
Speaker 1: It would be so ungodly popular.

158
00:07:49,330 --> 00:07:54,090
Speaker 1: It fills the Kinetacon main events, which is way big.

159
00:07:54,811 --> 00:07:56,678
Speaker 1: It's bigger than anime Bostons, I think.

160
00:07:58,023 --> 00:07:59,729
Speaker 1: Seating-wise, I think it is.

161
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:01,185
Speaker 0: Equal-ish.

162
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,604
Speaker 1: It depends on where that partition at the back goes.

163
00:08:03,664 --> 00:08:04,590
Speaker 1: I'd have to get some numbers.

164
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,106
Speaker 0: Tough call.

165
00:08:05,511 --> 00:08:07,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll try to figure out if they're the same.

166
00:08:07,553 --> 00:08:08,270
Speaker 0: It is close.

167
00:08:08,513 --> 00:08:09,709
Speaker 1: And it's getting bigger next year.

168
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:10,290
Speaker 0: Yep.

169
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:10,557
Speaker 0: Yeah.

170
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,069
Speaker 0: Then it will definitely be.

171
00:08:12,430 --> 00:08:15,101
Speaker 1: But their excuse was always, "Oh, we have Iron Artist.

172
00:08:15,422 --> 00:08:17,390
Speaker 1: We can't have two of the same kind of event.

173
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:18,407
Speaker 1: We have a long working relationship with Iron

174
00:08:18,428 --> 00:08:18,550
Speaker 1: Artist.".

175
00:08:18,751 --> 00:08:22,310
Speaker 0: Well, we heard that Iron Artist was not at Otacon this year.

176
00:08:22,370 --> 00:08:25,047
Speaker 1: Yeah, in fact, Super Art Fight, I was talking to them and I was like,

177
00:08:25,067 --> 00:08:25,248
Speaker 1: "Yeah.".

178
00:08:25,752 --> 00:08:28,330
Speaker 1: They told us when we brought it up that it was because they had Iron Artist.

179
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,105
Speaker 1: He was like, "Iron

180
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:29,270
Speaker 1: Artist?".

181
00:08:30,271 --> 00:08:33,109
Speaker 1: And then he gets back to me and I was like, "That was definitely not on the

182
00:08:33,129 --> 00:08:33,309
Speaker 1: schedule.".

183
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,546
Speaker 0: Dun dun dunnnnnn.

184
00:08:37,312 --> 00:08:37,989
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

185
00:08:38,751 --> 00:08:39,107
Speaker 1: I don't know.

186
00:08:39,230 --> 00:08:39,504
Speaker 0: I don't know.

187
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:40,020
Speaker 0: Anyway.

188
00:08:40,570 --> 00:08:43,669
Speaker 1: But, yeah, Super Art Fight, if you want to see them at KineticCon, they'll be there.

189
00:08:43,991 --> 00:08:46,706
Speaker 1: And if you want to see them at PAX, tell PAX.

190
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,070
Speaker 0: Go to the PAX forums, make a thread.

191
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:51,650
Speaker 1: Because we have told them, so hopefully we'll get them.

192
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:52,168
Speaker 0: PAX East.

193
00:08:52,390 --> 00:08:53,370
Speaker 0: They're probably not going to West.

194
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:54,666
Speaker 0: It's a little too close to the--.

195
00:08:55,172 --> 00:08:56,550
Speaker 1: I'll bet we could get them to go to West.

196
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:58,247
Speaker 1: If the thing is West-- Not right now.

197
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:04,634
Speaker 1: The problem is it'd be hard to fit them in because any West is already full to the brim-- East oh 12.

198
00:09:04,634 --> 00:09:08,003
Speaker 0: that's our pushing for central London and the cruise right anyway.

199
00:09:08,204 --> 00:09:10,229
Speaker 0: anyway speaking of conventions, right?

200
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:17,690
Speaker 0: You know New York comic-con is coming up pretty soon and normally we don't care that much about what's going on.

201
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:18,553
Speaker 0: It's your comic.

202
00:09:18,593 --> 00:09:20,339
Speaker 1: I mean with blue like our one or two panels.

203
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:25,195
Speaker 1: Yeah, well do the walk around interview some people But there's actually.

204
00:09:25,637 --> 00:09:29,290
Speaker 0: there was just news someone's gonna be at the New York Comic Con.

205
00:09:29,632 --> 00:09:30,256
Speaker 1: I wonder who?

206
00:09:30,276 --> 00:09:31,343
Speaker 0: you wonder who?

207
00:09:31,363 --> 00:09:32,510
Speaker 1: I haven't looked at the Internet.

208
00:09:32,731 --> 00:09:35,821
Speaker 0: It's someone that I would wait in a long line to see.

209
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:43,929
Speaker 0: I wouldn't pay to get the VIP badge to see them But I would wait in a long line huh, so we're gonna see how it goes down, and it's someone who?

210
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,150
Speaker 0: They might go to other conventions, but I've never heard of them being at another convention at least not recently.

211
00:09:51,872 --> 00:09:56,287
Speaker 1: I know it's not but I'm gonna guess Lauren Faust because I can't imagine you being more excited about someone.

212
00:09:56,528 --> 00:10:00,085
Speaker 0: no yeah Yeah, you know who it is Rainbow Dash.

213
00:10:00,628 --> 00:10:03,213
Speaker 1: no I don't know who it is.

214
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:04,056
Speaker 1: I haven't looked at the news.

215
00:10:04,578 --> 00:10:08,209
Speaker 0: It is Franklin Miller is going to be at the New York Comic Con.

216
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,765
Speaker 0: Really, yes really I?

217
00:10:12,671 --> 00:10:13,976
Speaker 1: Want to go to a Q&A with him.

218
00:10:14,137 --> 00:10:17,070
Speaker 1: I know right what I I'd ask him something about whores.

219
00:10:17,911 --> 00:10:18,334
Speaker 1: I'd be like.

220
00:10:18,615 --> 00:10:21,390
Speaker 1: so do you really like the aesthetic of whores?

221
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:23,640
Speaker 0: I don't know what his personality is like at all.

222
00:10:23,881 --> 00:10:24,665
Speaker 0: so it's gonna be.

223
00:10:24,906 --> 00:10:34,030
Speaker 1: I know if you go You don't want to ask first I mean what if he's an Alan Moore, but at the same time I mean it's hard to say I know very little about his non-professional life.

224
00:10:34,352 --> 00:10:38,277
Speaker 0: The only thing I know about him is I read Eisner Miller Which is just basically a book.

225
00:10:38,397 --> 00:10:52,230
Speaker 0: that is a conversate that is a that is basically a written-down Recording of a conversation between him and Will Eisner, and he seemed like a nice normal guy pretty much so I Couldn't really tell his personality.

226
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:58,030
Speaker 0: It was just a guy who was a comic expert talking about comics, so it's it doesn't really tell me about him.

227
00:10:58,513 --> 00:11:05,310
Speaker 0: But if I had to ask him a question, I would definitely ask him Robocop questions Because those would be that you know there's people are gonna ask him plenty of bad.

228
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,032
Speaker 0: You know what that is.

229
00:11:06,092 --> 00:11:12,130
Speaker 1: That's the equivalent of we need Daryl Saratian style questions at more non-anime events.

230
00:11:12,311 --> 00:11:18,370
Speaker 1: You got to basically go into any press thing find whatever that famous person's crystal triangle is and ask about nothing.

231
00:11:18,592 --> 00:11:22,751
Speaker 0: That's right, so There you go.

232
00:11:29,598 --> 00:11:31,680
Speaker 1: so things of the day.

233
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:36,064
Speaker 1: a long time ago I Bought well bought.

234
00:11:36,204 --> 00:11:38,991
Speaker 1: I basically sent VHS tapes that were sent back to me.

235
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,159
Speaker 1: all of Sailor Moon all of it all 200 episodes.

236
00:11:43,383 --> 00:11:47,800
Speaker 1: I watched all of it and some of my friends watched all of it, and we had an inside joke.

237
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:49,379
Speaker 1: This is pre front row crew.

238
00:11:50,021 --> 00:11:56,065
Speaker 1: This is like back from the day of eight people gaga and the joke was Excuse me.

239
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:58,779
Speaker 1: What time is it now?

240
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:03,027
Speaker 0: It's for party.

241
00:12:03,168 --> 00:12:09,746
Speaker 1: I've never heard this and then the first person would say thank you It was this ritual.

242
00:12:09,807 --> 00:12:13,319
Speaker 1: I you know friend groups you have like that ritual eyes like weird greeting like hello.

243
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:21,880
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, I've never heard this one before because it was my old crew like a high school But it was in Sailor Moon.

244
00:12:22,384 --> 00:12:22,626
Speaker 1: There was.

245
00:12:22,646 --> 00:12:30,040
Speaker 1: this is random scene where this guy Randomly just starts speaking in English and are there three people speaking in English?

246
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:35,400
Speaker 1: We're hitting critical mass here inside jokes.

247
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:54,320
Speaker 1: but uh so Sailor Moon has a wealth of scenes where random motherfuckers speaks English but it's clearly just one of the Japanese voice actors and They're always awful, so I submit for your consideration One of those scenes from Sailor Moon also.

248
00:12:54,924 --> 00:13:00,720
Speaker 1: It's kind of a I don't know sort of an aside But you'll see this in a lot of anime like what was the old?

249
00:13:01,562 --> 00:13:03,109
Speaker 1: I hate the Japanese people.

250
00:13:03,651 --> 00:13:05,660
Speaker 1: all Japanese people are stupid.

251
00:13:06,683 --> 00:13:08,209
Speaker 0: I don't remember that was a dub of.

252
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:13,359
Speaker 1: it was a sub of some show and a guy just says that in English Cracks an egg over another guy's head.

253
00:13:14,521 --> 00:13:28,284
Speaker 1: Anyway, so also if you haven't seen Sailor Moon at all ever It's kind of a trick to get you to look at a YouTube video that happens to kind of as the Sailor Moon looks like like for real People don't know it.

254
00:13:28,324 --> 00:13:32,299
Speaker 1: I don't think a lot of people who listen to geek nights have actually seen Sailor Moon.

255
00:13:33,283 --> 00:13:37,420
Speaker 0: I haven't watched like a whole episode of it, but I've seen plenty of it.

256
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:38,447
Speaker 0: I know what it looks like.

257
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,059
Speaker 0: I can spot it from a mile away.

258
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:40,883
Speaker 1: We'll see.

259
00:13:40,923 --> 00:13:44,700
Speaker 1: plus you might have you probably only really recognized when she is Sailor Moon as she's Sailor Moon.

260
00:13:45,103 --> 00:13:46,535
Speaker 0: No, I know when she's not Sailor Moon.

261
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:51,319
Speaker 0: Ah She looks the same only without a skirt jeans and a sweater.

262
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:52,442
Speaker 1: Sometimes.

263
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:53,630
Speaker 1: sometimes she wears other things.

264
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:54,415
Speaker 0: was that your thing of the day?

265
00:13:54,435 --> 00:13:55,159
Speaker 1: that was my thing of the day.

266
00:13:55,481 --> 00:13:56,426
Speaker 0: So you know what you know.

267
00:13:56,527 --> 00:13:59,080
Speaker 0: sometimes I use the webcomic as a thing of the day, right?

268
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,640
Speaker 0: Which is also always pretty good, but the thing a lot of people don't know is that I guess they do know.

269
00:14:03,721 --> 00:14:12,660
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't know whatever Webcomic artists they draw a lot more than just their webcomic, you know, they make lots of sketches and notebooks all the time.

270
00:14:12,821 --> 00:14:19,035
Speaker 1: Yeah, like remember a lot of people don't realize or at least didn't realize before Atomic Robo that a bit theater.

271
00:14:19,316 --> 00:14:24,089
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy can draw What anyway, Brian clever could you can draw?

272
00:14:24,109 --> 00:14:25,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't know that he could draw.

273
00:14:25,795 --> 00:14:26,076
Speaker 0: we can.

274
00:14:26,478 --> 00:14:28,060
Speaker 1: I'll show you some his art really anyway.

275
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,857
Speaker 0: So it's always good if you can go and find.

276
00:14:31,897 --> 00:14:36,799
Speaker 0: for example Some artists will put theirs they'll make sketches and put them on Twitter and they'll be on Twitter.

277
00:14:36,819 --> 00:14:38,450
Speaker 0: pick Yeah, and some of them they might be on.

278
00:14:38,491 --> 00:14:39,720
Speaker 0: why frog which is the same shit?

279
00:14:40,142 --> 00:14:44,160
Speaker 0: Some people might put him in like a Picasa or a deviant art or a something something, right?

280
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:50,782
Speaker 0: Well, I found out today from some Twitter links that John Allison from scary-go-round Right.

281
00:14:50,842 --> 00:14:53,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forgot all about that comic.

282
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really liked that comic.

283
00:14:55,276 --> 00:14:56,600
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start reading that comic again.

284
00:14:56,941 --> 00:15:04,965
Speaker 0: So he puts his on flicker and he drew some Thundercats that are At our epic hilarity.

285
00:15:05,566 --> 00:15:09,935
Speaker 0: Oh, like I can't even say hilarious because I mean, I mean just look at this fucking snarf.

286
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:16,439
Speaker 1: Oh My god that That pushes all the same buttons that like Kate Beaton art does.

287
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:16,942
Speaker 0: well I know.

288
00:15:17,002 --> 00:15:20,780
Speaker 0: in fact Kate beaten linked it and I thought it might have been Kate beaten in the first place.

289
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,463
Speaker 0: But no, it wasn't.

290
00:15:21,946 --> 00:15:25,324
Speaker 0: so this is a quite the excellent, you know It's a whole.

291
00:15:25,404 --> 00:15:27,479
Speaker 0: you can look through his whole flicker account is my thing of the day.

292
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,493
Speaker 0: Oh my god, Lee is you know, it's full of gems.

293
00:15:30,694 --> 00:15:31,096
Speaker 1: I can't believe.

294
00:15:31,136 --> 00:15:32,020
Speaker 1: I didn't know this existed.

295
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,923
Speaker 1: I also guess 500.

296
00:15:32,923 --> 00:15:37,499
Speaker 0: I think is 519 things in his photo stream, but specifically these two Thundercats.

297
00:15:37,599 --> 00:15:38,744
Speaker 0: one I can't believe.

298
00:15:39,046 --> 00:15:40,954
Speaker 1: I forgot that webcomic existed.

299
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:45,720
Speaker 1: I think when I built my new computer I just didn't like remake the bookmark and I just kind of forgot.

300
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:50,920
Speaker 0: It's actually kind of weird because if you go to scary-go-round.com, it's a scary-go-round presents bad machinery.

00:18:34,801 --> 00:18:40,832
Speaker 0: We're also you know I mean it would be useful to teach a whole room of people how to play at once Yeah, as opposed to teaching over and over again.

361
00:18:40,852 --> 00:18:41,797
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's well and good.

366
00:19:08,157 --> 00:19:08,700
Speaker 1: That's my fault.

367
00:19:09,142 --> 00:19:12,415
Speaker 1: We're starting to spot it because that's the sleeper hit of packs.

368
00:19:12,555 --> 00:19:13,760
Speaker 0: I think we need to get more spot.

369
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:19,660
Speaker 1: It's Carcassonne seven wonders and then the fourth one in that session is secret.

370
00:19:20,541 --> 00:19:24,277
Speaker 1: It might be an indie RPG maybe might be we're not sure.

371
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:24,960

Speaker 0: banana grams.

377
00:19:34,093 --> 00:19:40,747
Speaker 1: to our popular consciousness We need to return the favor with spot it unless of course knowing him He probably already has like a sack of spot.

378
00:19:40,827 --> 00:19:42,694
Speaker 1: It's probably if he doesn't.

379
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:44,300
Speaker 1: well, you could beat someone with a sack of spot.

380
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,406

00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,042
Speaker 0: now That'll be it.

00:20:34,584 --> 00:20:36,552
Speaker 0: So two weeks you have a deadline of.

400
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:38,380
Speaker 0: you know, I need time to read the comics.

401
00:20:38,861 --> 00:20:45,582
Speaker 0: So you got maybe a week or so left to submit a worst webcomic and we're gonna start checking them out to figure out Which one's the worst?

402
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:48,551
Speaker 1: Yep, two observations on this one stop submitting control.

403
00:20:48,852 --> 00:20:50,096
Speaker 0: You say that every time cuz it's funny.

404
00:20:50,116 --> 00:21:03,360
Speaker 1: - I I Realized that many of you seem to have a surprising amount of furry Pornography at your fingertips and as soon as we said we have a contest.

405
00:21:04,323 --> 00:21:07,152
Speaker 1: How many furry porn webcomics can there be?

406
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:07,593
Speaker 0: it's like.

407
00:21:07,733 --> 00:21:15,936
Speaker 0: I know that furry porn webcomics exists And I know there are many of them and I know some of them also combine lots of different You know sexual fetishes of sorts.

408
00:21:15,976 --> 00:21:21,028
Speaker 0: really dude I couldn't name a single one But the fact that people could you know did.

409
00:21:21,691 --> 00:21:26,287
Speaker 0: if you Google sir if I had there was a contest I wanted to win I Could Google search for and find some.

410
00:21:26,669 --> 00:21:27,171
Speaker 1: I could also.

411
00:21:27,191 --> 00:21:29,600
Speaker 0: I don't know any but it's like people submitting them.

412
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:30,826
Speaker 0: It seemed like they know them.

413
00:21:31,088 --> 00:21:31,751
Speaker 0: It's like a good name.

414
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:32,455
Speaker 1: How do you even?

415
00:21:32,495 --> 00:21:33,239
Speaker 0: how do you know these?

416
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:43,229
Speaker 1: I could name comics that were technically furry but weren't porn like Sabrina was fairly famous among the fan crowds or Erotic in partial nature, but not porn.

417
00:21:43,249 --> 00:21:43,811
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

418
00:21:43,851 --> 00:21:51,914
Speaker 1: There's a glove but that's actually right, but It's not just furry porn it's scary gratuitous poorly drawn furry porn.

419
00:21:52,235 --> 00:21:53,880
Speaker 1: and fuck you all for making me read this.

420
00:21:54,302 --> 00:21:55,510
Speaker 0: You don't have to read a lot of it.

421
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:56,617
Speaker 0: We just read enough to figure out.

422
00:21:56,637 --> 00:21:57,040
Speaker 0: What's the world?

423
00:21:57,380 --> 00:22:06,744
Speaker 1: I believe the rule we post is that we have to read if available the first ten the last ten and Beyond that We're.

424
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:10,222
Speaker 0: so more it's gonna be a completely subjective Judgment.

425
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:19,595
Speaker 0: where it is we examine the website the art the writing that the if it's still going the craziness Factor we want to take into account and do account and it's up to us.

426
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,465
Speaker 1: the craziness of the author Definitely comes into play.

427
00:22:22,807 --> 00:22:24,372
Speaker 0: anything you want can come into play.

428
00:22:24,713 --> 00:22:28,548
Speaker 0: and remember if you submit an entry to this I know let's do it since there's only two of us.

429
00:22:28,628 --> 00:22:33,907
Speaker 0: Let's do like a you know, an ebert thumbs up thumbs downs System, what does thumbs up mean?

430
00:22:34,408 --> 00:22:36,837
Speaker 0: that it's the worst the worst.

431
00:22:37,038 --> 00:22:39,646
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not exactly so.

432
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,331
Speaker 1: thumbs down means is a good comic.

433
00:22:41,692 --> 00:22:44,520
Speaker 0: Yeah as in it's not the worst because it's the worst webcomic contest.

434
00:22:44,663 --> 00:22:47,058
Speaker 1: All right Might not have enough thumbs.

435
00:22:48,725 --> 00:22:49,738

450
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:52,580
Speaker 1: Yeah until eventually you stop those shows going waves like after a story arc ends.

451
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,812
Speaker 1: It's like the spell breaks and I have like a three episode gap.

452
00:23:55,892 --> 00:23:58,140

Speaker 0: It fits the North Star - I'm two different openings Oh, so you finish with the North Star one.

465
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:27,824
Speaker 0: I'll just son like it actually says this the North Star - you know - at the at the beginning it's on and he's going to the island of Bob but not Ashra, yeah.

466
00:24:27,844 --> 00:24:28,066
Speaker 1: Yeah.

467
00:24:28,428 --> 00:24:28,871
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

468
00:24:28,891 --> 00:24:32,128
Speaker 0: You're already that where everybody is Surprisingly badass.

469
00:24:32,229 --> 00:24:38,359
Speaker 0: Yes, the island of bad Badass island where the real badasses were hiding this whole time.

470
00:24:39,901 --> 00:24:44,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, you look back at like King Sama like whatever dude King Sama your heart.

471
00:24:49,220 --> 00:25:00,396
Speaker 1: But it says to me that Every time I think about what there's a few exceptions like number six and even to the east started this way But then it kind of like I got less invested as it went on as it got less good.

472
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:07,564
Speaker 1: Yeah, but All I want out of anime right now is Either a Satoshi koan movie.

473
00:25:07,625 --> 00:25:12,578
Speaker 1: Oh wait or coming kind of ghost in the shell stand-alone complex 3.

474
00:25:12,578 --> 00:25:15,170
Speaker 0: somebody Sent a link to something today.

475
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:17,602
Speaker 0: I don't know much about it, but it's called H Plus.

476
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:20,920
Speaker 0: it's live-action and basically is it goes in the shell ripoff.

477
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:22,243
Speaker 0: That's all.

478
00:25:22,283 --> 00:25:22,866
Speaker 0: that's all I know.

479
00:25:22,886 --> 00:25:24,454
Speaker 0: I don't know anything else.

480
00:25:24,594 --> 00:25:27,017
Speaker 0: I think that I could look it up But I guess what is it?

481
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,749
Speaker 1: Specifically about the anime that draws in like this like.

482
00:25:30,829 --> 00:25:33,937
Speaker 1: why do we like number six over the million other shows?

483
00:25:33,997 --> 00:25:38,535
Speaker 1: because we've watched A lot of similar ish shows where we watch the first episode.

484
00:25:38,555 --> 00:25:39,278
Speaker 1: We're like what the fuck was that?

485
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:39,660
Speaker 1: who cares?

486
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,388
Speaker 1: We never even felt like we forget the name of it.

487
00:25:41,790 --> 00:25:41,971
Speaker 0: Mmm.

488
00:25:42,172 --> 00:25:43,780
Speaker 1: Why do I remember the name of the show?

489
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,366
Speaker 1: Like what?

490
00:25:44,569 --> 00:25:45,179
Speaker 1: what's different?

491
00:25:48,124 --> 00:26:01,340
Speaker 1: I mean it starts out pretty generic like, you know, it's kind of like starts out like geo say like, okay You've got some characters kids school some sort of utopia science fiction, but oh wait, maybe it's a dystopia.

492
00:26:02,183 --> 00:26:03,168
Speaker 0: Well, it always is right.

493
00:26:03,208 --> 00:26:11,380
Speaker 0: It's that I've noticed there's certain things that are Stereotypical, you know reused cliche plots and anime over and over again, right?

494
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:11,902
Speaker 0: There's the.

495
00:26:12,325 --> 00:26:21,700
Speaker 0: you know, you're inside the pretty and beautiful Perfect utopian city and then there's a. it has some sort of walls around it and if you leave it's Blair, right?

496
00:26:22,121 --> 00:26:27,539
Speaker 0: You see that sort of an apple seed definitely an ergo proxy definitely in Raza fon definitely in number six.

497
00:26:28,363 --> 00:26:37,980
Speaker 0: What other you know sort of even jellying doesn't have it straight up But it's like even jelly is definitely this city and the rest of the world are sort of you know, not the same, right?

498
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:41,469
Speaker 0: But there's just so many animes where it's like there.

499
00:26:41,529 --> 00:26:43,738
Speaker 0: it's like the whole city is a Truman show almost.

500
00:26:43,758 --> 00:26:54,451
Speaker 0: Yep That's just you know, this is one example, but there's so many, you know It's the situation but yet I'm drawn in.

501
00:26:54,532 --> 00:26:57,684
Speaker 1: I actually kind of want to know what the deal is But we want there's also.

502
00:26:57,765 --> 00:26:59,170
Speaker 0: there's also the secret tower.

503
00:26:59,310 --> 00:26:59,872
Speaker 0: cliche.

504
00:27:00,234 --> 00:27:03,123
Speaker 0: number six also has what I'm getting at Promised.

505
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:03,646
Speaker 0: has that?

506
00:27:03,726 --> 00:27:05,980
Speaker 1: was it darker than black or was that there was one show?

507
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:11,988
Speaker 1: I remember we watched an episode of that started out kind of cool like this and Then it shows you like a straight-up.

508
00:27:12,048 --> 00:27:14,537
Speaker 1: Just here is the wall around the city.

509
00:27:14,638 --> 00:27:15,200
Speaker 1: What's the deal?

510
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:21,760
Speaker 1: We're not gonna tell you and by the end of the episode I didn't give a shit Like I didn't care what was on the other side of that wall.

511
00:27:22,304 --> 00:27:23,454
Speaker 0: I always want to see someone.

512
00:27:23,474 --> 00:27:28,580
Speaker 0: just you know If you're gonna do cliches like this at least take them and turn them on their head.

513
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:32,516
Speaker 1: So what if the story of ergo proxy is really yeah, it sucks outside.

514
00:27:32,556 --> 00:27:33,540
Speaker 1: The inside is a paradise.

515
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,726
Speaker 1: The main character is just crazy.

516
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:36,093
Speaker 0: That's not a bad one.

517
00:27:36,234 --> 00:27:37,340
Speaker 1: I would like to see a show like that.

518
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:42,048
Speaker 0: I was thinking more like you're outside the city, right and The Oh big.

519
00:27:42,088 --> 00:27:43,220
Speaker 0: Oh, it was another one with city walls.

520
00:27:44,302 --> 00:27:46,720
Speaker 1: Well, well, well, well, it can't spoil right?

521
00:27:47,544 --> 00:27:48,259
Speaker 0: That's not a secret.

522
00:27:49,421 --> 00:27:55,897
Speaker 0: But you know you start outside the walls to begin with and you see that there's a city that's walled in and you have no Fucking clue what's in there?

523
00:27:56,741 --> 00:27:57,196
Speaker 0: until later.

524
00:27:58,401 --> 00:27:59,445
Speaker 1: Well, you get that a little bit.

525
00:27:59,465 --> 00:28:04,060
Speaker 1: remember in last exile when you finally get inside the the real people's stuff and you see what?

526
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:07,460
Speaker 1: Their lives are like with their first water and their caviar.

527
00:28:07,981 --> 00:28:08,703
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of.

528
00:28:08,763 --> 00:28:09,425
Speaker 0: but it's it's not.

529
00:28:09,485 --> 00:28:10,849
Speaker 0: it's not an it's specifically.

530
00:28:10,889 --> 00:28:15,320
Speaker 0: the enclosed city physical structure is always you know or the secret tower.

531
00:28:15,441 --> 00:28:24,032
Speaker 0: That's up to something a ziggurat of some kind like a metropolis or place promised, you know Yeah You know the same things over and over again in so many different shows and those always.

532
00:28:24,453 --> 00:28:35,108
Speaker 0: it seems like there are certain cliches that are That are usually in good shows now, but not always and certain ones that are usually in bad shows But not always I mean part of it is like.

533
00:28:35,128 --> 00:28:39,525
Speaker 1: I look at the moment when the show you have that moment of oh shit That's what this show is about.

534
00:28:39,847 --> 00:28:50,663
Speaker 1: like in bacchanal the first episode when you're like, alright gangsters Alright I can dig this and then motherfucker gets stabbed and you realize what the show is really about and you're like, ah That's another thing.

535
00:28:50,703 --> 00:28:55,744
Speaker 0: a lot of shows that turn out to be good do is the very beginning of the first episode is some Dark action scene.

536
00:28:55,784 --> 00:28:59,599
Speaker 0: maybe someone gets killed or someone's running and they get shot or something like that.

537
00:29:00,342 --> 00:29:10,537
Speaker 0: And then it goes la la opener and then la la la introducing characters And then it's not until maybe even the second or third episode They tie it back to that when they cried it.

538
00:29:10,578 --> 00:29:14,110
Speaker 0: third 32nd thing that happened at the beginning of the first episode.

539
00:29:14,130 --> 00:29:25,250
Speaker 1: remember when they cry opening scene the violent Murder with a baseball bat of someone and then moe happy opener and then moe happy school Like there was no link back to baseball bat murder.

540
00:29:25,572 --> 00:29:30,437
Speaker 1: Yep until later until later You can make a show where you never link back.

541
00:29:31,462 --> 00:29:36,620
Speaker 0: Well, did you have a thing that happens in before the opener that doesn't have anything to do with the real show at all?

542
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:44,066
Speaker 0: I just never go back to that You know, what I would do is I would have Like 30 seconds before every opener.

543
00:29:44,086 --> 00:29:53,129
Speaker 0: that would make no sense individually, but could be shuffled and pasted in order to make sense But it's nothing to do with the actual show.

544
00:29:53,189 --> 00:29:58,318
Speaker 1: that's what you do in front of a kids show like case closed Because then the kids try to solve the mystery.

545
00:29:59,163 --> 00:30:11,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so I guess let's put it this way What would make like right now Describe like the anime that you would just like lose your shit over like you would like Leave work early to get home and watch that shit?

546
00:30:11,502 --> 00:30:14,420
Speaker 0: Well, there's a lot of things that could fit that bill, right?

547
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,275
Speaker 0: But I think what it would.

548
00:30:15,377 --> 00:30:27,980
Speaker 0: you know It really had to be a whole lineup because there's so many different kinds of anime I like I would need like one to fit every possible thing maybe even you know, and then again It's like well if I can have the world why don't I have five of every category of anime?

549
00:30:29,266 --> 00:30:31,014
Speaker 0: Why don't I have infinity of every category?

550
00:30:31,034 --> 00:30:31,878
Speaker 0: of this way?

551
00:30:31,918 --> 00:30:37,681
Speaker 1: then Let's look at the ghost in the shell kind of show cuz we've both talked at least why I guess give me goes to the shell Three.

552
00:30:37,882 --> 00:30:39,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, you don't need to change it.

553
00:30:39,708 --> 00:30:40,691
Speaker 1: movie or TV show.

554
00:30:40,871 --> 00:30:45,693
Speaker 1: TV show really not another movie not another four That wouldn't hurt either.

555
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,814
Speaker 1: Yeah There's what I want.

556
00:30:47,834 --> 00:30:48,139
Speaker 1: You know what?

557
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:49,222
Speaker 1: I love you Mamoru.

558
00:30:49,262 --> 00:30:54,613
Speaker 1: She if I could change anything about a director other than bringing Satoshi come back from the dead.

559
00:30:54,633 --> 00:31:05,279
Speaker 1: I Was never allowed to make a live-action movie again because you would be forced to make comedy anime with action scenes.

560
00:31:06,482 --> 00:31:07,871
Speaker 1: That is all I want from you.

561
00:31:07,911 --> 00:31:09,139
Speaker 0: I think he doesn't want to do anymore.

562
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,588
Speaker 0: I mean, Mamoru.

563
00:31:10,609 --> 00:31:12,460
Speaker 0: She make it a new Pat Lebois TV series.

564
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:15,132
Speaker 0: There you go done comedy with comedy with action scenes.

565
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:16,740
Speaker 1: actually, you know what I would like to see.

566
00:31:17,021 --> 00:31:20,360
Speaker 1: I'd like to see oh, she go pick up like her say at surah style shows.

567
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,295
Speaker 1: Well, you already did that do it again do something like that.

568
00:31:23,516 --> 00:31:25,042
Speaker 1: Pat Lebois imagine Imagine this.

569
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:28,293
Speaker 1: imagine if oh, she did the next key Taro.

570
00:31:28,313 --> 00:31:30,600
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know if that's his style.

571
00:31:30,923 --> 00:31:31,811
Speaker 1: I think you could pull it off.

572
00:31:31,831 --> 00:31:37,340
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, the thing is I'd also like to see some team-ups right like if I like you get if you know.

573
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:41,378
Speaker 0: You know, it's always like what if we get two amazing people together like lazy Matsumoto and Daft Punk?

574
00:31:45,042 --> 00:31:53,516
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know do those combos really work, you know that in anime at least in comic books They often work because you get the amazing writer and the amazing artist anime they can.

575
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,822
Speaker 1: but I think it's more subtle It's more.

576
00:31:54,862 --> 00:31:57,370
Speaker 1: it's not the matter of what they both bring to the table.

577
00:31:57,490 --> 00:32:10,960
Speaker 1: It's more what like bullshit drama limitations did they bring to the table and look it's uh Utena, I mean Ikuhara and Chiyo Saito together made Something awesome that they couldn't have each made on their own.

578
00:32:11,161 --> 00:32:20,370
Speaker 0: so we can't just go out there and be like, you know, let's get Miyazaki and You know fucking Matsumoto together to work on the same thing.

579
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:28,780
Speaker 0: It's like well that probably actually wouldn't turn out that well Right, but what you could do is you could say well, why don't we get lazy Matsumoto to do Lupin the third?

580
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,768
Speaker 0: that's not bad because I heard.

581
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:33,603
Speaker 0: but just to make say a Ghibli movie.

582
00:32:33,623 --> 00:32:37,320
Speaker 0: so he has Ghibli money and Ghibli animators and right working for Mike.

583
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,365
Speaker 1: I just imagine that.

584
00:32:38,425 --> 00:32:39,670
Speaker 0: remember but he has.

585
00:32:39,691 --> 00:32:41,780
Speaker 0: he just writes and directs whatever he wants.

586
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:45,650
Speaker 1: I glee ostro the Miyazaki Lupin the best like.

587
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,493
Speaker 1: I love that movie.

588
00:32:46,533 --> 00:32:48,057
Speaker 1: It's one of my favorite movies of all time.

589
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:52,759
Speaker 1: I Want to see the same take on the Matsumoto verse.

590
00:32:54,654 --> 00:33:00,109
Speaker 0: So Galaxy Express, yeah, we could do that.

591
00:33:00,169 --> 00:33:01,193
Speaker 1: I would love to see that.

592
00:33:01,213 --> 00:33:01,835
Speaker 0: That'd be awesome.

593
00:33:02,096 --> 00:33:11,311
Speaker 0: Oh my god I wonder what happened on the space train if if Miyazaki was right now, but the thing is Miyazaki You know, he hasn't been doing too much lately is most.

594
00:33:11,392 --> 00:33:12,355
Speaker 1: I just want more Lupin too.

595
00:33:12,375 --> 00:33:13,920
Speaker 0: cuz Daryl said he's on it.

596
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,106
Speaker 0: He's on the downswing.

597
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,734
Speaker 0: He's got an upswing with his pon.

598
00:33:16,754 --> 00:33:19,692
Speaker 0: Yo, I mean Panya was good But it wasn't it was.

599
00:33:19,752 --> 00:33:20,599
Speaker 0: no spirited away.

600
00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:23,151
Speaker 1: We need to get back to some Porco Rosso.

601
00:33:23,311 --> 00:33:25,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, I heard of Porco Rosso to rumor.

602
00:33:25,561 --> 00:33:27,145
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't even need to make wishes.

603
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:27,727
Speaker 1: You know what?

604
00:33:27,787 --> 00:33:28,529
Speaker 1: I heard true.

605
00:33:28,689 --> 00:33:35,299
Speaker 1: I did hear from a semi legitimate source a standalone complex like for real three rumor.

606
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:40,191
Speaker 1: But it was while it was from a pretty legitimate source that I would trust.

607
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:43,540
Speaker 1: I'm so cynical of those kinds of rumors.

608
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:45,975
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't believe anything till I see it.

609
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,747
Speaker 1: I mean Oh My god, I want that so much.

610
00:33:50,988 --> 00:33:52,314
Speaker 0: I know right I pay monies.

611
00:33:52,917 --> 00:34:01,130
Speaker 1: Yeah but I Heard from Daryl's this man in my world order cuz remember we used to watch like the Lupin Specials like after all the movies.

612
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they tended to be just go downhill.

613
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:06,373
Speaker 1: So apparently since we stopped watching him, you know what happened?

614
00:34:06,453 --> 00:34:06,875
Speaker 0: They suck.

615
00:34:06,996 --> 00:34:08,040
Speaker 1: They got even worse.

616
00:34:08,221 --> 00:34:08,943
Speaker 0: How could they get worse?

617
00:34:08,963 --> 00:34:13,040
Speaker 1: like everyone was worse than the last one and apparently the one that I was kind of excited about.

618
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,500
Speaker 1: that I just kind of ignored.

619
00:34:14,621 --> 00:34:19,280
Speaker 1: I was waiting to hear a review where it was basically red versus green like different eras of Lupin.

620
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,226
Speaker 0: Yeah, what about the detective Conan one?

621
00:34:21,306 --> 00:34:21,647
Speaker 1: Apparently?

622
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:24,275
Speaker 1: No, apparently the red versus green one sucked balls.

623
00:34:24,436 --> 00:34:24,878
Speaker 0: What?

624
00:34:25,138 --> 00:34:35,338
Speaker 1: Yeah Like it was good concept poorly executed And apparently Lupin is not even like that big in the case closed one.

625
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,871
Speaker 0: so eh What would happen if this summer Wars guy did Lupin me?

626
00:34:39,013 --> 00:34:39,835
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

627
00:34:40,056 --> 00:34:40,780
Speaker 0: What do you think you do?

628
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:43,550
Speaker 1: That would be no he would you know why?

629
00:34:43,771 --> 00:34:51,800
Speaker 1: cuz look at the kinds of characters that like The Lupin family as a giant group just to look at what was great about summer wars.

630
00:34:52,203 --> 00:34:53,737
Speaker 1: He could pull off that same kind of stuff.

631
00:34:55,844 --> 00:35:04,558
Speaker 0: Or if he got the Durara guy to do a movie Instead of doing a show cuz then he'd be forced to like bring it all in with a lot of money obviously.

632
00:35:04,779 --> 00:35:06,766
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, what would he do that?

633
00:35:06,786 --> 00:35:07,709
Speaker 1: What what story?

634
00:35:07,729 --> 00:35:08,953
Speaker 1: an original story maybe?

635
00:35:08,974 --> 00:35:10,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's something on its own.

636
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,708
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't want to Durara movie.

637
00:35:12,929 --> 00:35:13,953
Speaker 1: No, no, but I'm saying even.

638
00:35:13,993 --> 00:35:15,520
Speaker 1: but what about him doing his movie?

639
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,007
Speaker 1: That's also a take on an existing thing.

640
00:35:18,128 --> 00:35:20,676
Speaker 0: No, it should just be it's his own movie.

641
00:35:21,057 --> 00:35:22,522
Speaker 0: Just something original I want to see.

642
00:35:22,944 --> 00:35:26,316
Speaker 0: you know, there's too many, you know as much as I want more Lupin's that don't suck.

643
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:32,576
Speaker 0: or you know Another space train something, you know, even though nothing will ever be as good as it was right?

644
00:35:33,118 --> 00:35:38,797
Speaker 0: It's much better Just have more new original things, you know, Hollywood can give me all the sequels in the universe.

645
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:39,620
Speaker 0: I don't need more.

646
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,567
Speaker 0: I need more original something.

647
00:35:41,607 --> 00:35:41,929
Speaker 0: that doesn't.

648
00:35:41,949 --> 00:35:43,374
Speaker 0: I mean I'll ask ghost in the shell.

649
00:35:43,394 --> 00:35:44,879
Speaker 0: I'll take more but other things.

650
00:35:45,623 --> 00:35:53,894
Speaker 0: I want something new and original I would take your wood on because look at James Bond I mean like you wouldn't want Otomo to make a Kira - you'd want Otomo to make something fresh.

651
00:35:54,215 --> 00:35:59,149
Speaker 0: That's not freedom and cup noodle That all he did was design little.

652
00:35:59,189 --> 00:35:59,912
Speaker 1: what about manga?

653
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:01,500
Speaker 1: because there's the easy answer here.

654
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:01,902
Speaker 1: But what?

655
00:36:02,424 --> 00:36:06,040
Speaker 0: well, I mean, you know, obviously you want to bring Tezuka and such back from the dead.

656
00:36:07,242 --> 00:36:09,551
Speaker 0: Like you could do animes too if you came back from the dead.

657
00:36:09,611 --> 00:36:13,709
Speaker 1: the thing is I don't even need to say Oh, why don't they make a manga about this?

658
00:36:13,729 --> 00:36:14,412
Speaker 1: They're all done.

659
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,256
Speaker 1: They're all in Japan.

660
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,020
Speaker 1: None of them are in English.

661
00:36:16,442 --> 00:36:17,909
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty much mostly.

662
00:36:17,949 --> 00:36:18,573
Speaker 0: Hey make more.

663
00:36:18,633 --> 00:36:20,060
Speaker 0: say things like sanctuary.

664
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:26,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd like to see a sanctuary though that took place in the US but had that same attitude, right?

665
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:37,298
Speaker 1: So like it, you know like Frank Miller's sanctuary, you know you need you need Frank Miller to adapt sanctuary Heavily like heavily adapted don't stay too true to it to the real U.S.

666
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:45,906
Speaker 0: Make it an HBO like one season to show or dirty 80s U.S This is all he likes.

667
00:36:46,529 --> 00:36:51,266
Speaker 1: dirty 80s punk shit, yeah You ever see Strange Days?

668
00:36:51,848 --> 00:36:52,410
Speaker 0: Never heard of it.

669
00:36:52,490 --> 00:36:52,751
Speaker 1: Really?

670
00:36:52,771 --> 00:36:53,835
Speaker 1: You should watch Strange Days.

671
00:36:53,895 --> 00:36:54,578
Speaker 1: It's in Netflix.

672
00:36:54,598 --> 00:36:55,180
Speaker 1: Is it strange?

673
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:58,930
Speaker 1: It's you know the 80s like that 80s punk dystopia.

674
00:36:59,191 --> 00:37:02,000
Speaker 1: Yeah Strange Days is the 90s dystopia.

675
00:37:02,921 --> 00:37:05,796
Speaker 1: I've seen very few representations of the 90s dystopia.

676
00:37:05,836 --> 00:37:06,640
Speaker 0: The 90s are pretty good.

677
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:11,940
Speaker 1: That's why yeah, exactly Strange Days is take the problems of the 90s and extend them into the future.

678
00:37:12,941 --> 00:37:17,054
Speaker 1: It's actually really good and the ending is the same ending as the difference engine.

679
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:20,622
Speaker 0: So wouldn't that be like Back to the Future 2?

680
00:37:20,622 --> 00:37:26,530
Speaker 1: You know kind of similar except more race stuff Because you know Rodney King all that stuff.

681
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:27,934
Speaker 1: It's kind of like that extension.

682
00:37:28,296 --> 00:37:32,001
Speaker 1: Ah, but yeah actually Back to the Future 2.

683
00:37:32,001 --> 00:37:37,240
Speaker 1: Similar in some ways but Strange Days has a little bit of a Ghost in the Shell element.

684
00:37:39,001 --> 00:37:39,564
Speaker 1: You'll like the movie.

685
00:37:39,584 --> 00:37:40,247
Speaker 1: It's up your alley.

686
00:37:40,408 --> 00:37:45,400
Speaker 0: Maybe I Don't know but yeah, I got a manga that doesn't exist, right?

687
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,084
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

688
00:37:46,104 --> 00:37:48,501
Speaker 0: well most of the manga is just like on go, you know It's.

689
00:37:48,621 --> 00:37:50,068
Speaker 1: it's so the ones that I want to read.

690
00:37:50,109 --> 00:37:52,380
Speaker 1: I just need someone to translate them and release them here.

691
00:37:53,061 --> 00:37:55,795
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, it's like I want more Phoenix.

692
00:37:55,835 --> 00:37:56,760
Speaker 0: That's not good, right?

693
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,070
Speaker 0: I Don't know what kind of manga doesn't exist that I actually.

694
00:38:02,251 --> 00:38:05,903
Speaker 1: I think it all seems to exist as much as I want sanctuary to Be like.

695
00:38:06,345 --> 00:38:07,270
Speaker 0: I guess you know.

696
00:38:07,431 --> 00:38:08,074
Speaker 0: go back to anime.

697
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:09,260
Speaker 0: I'll take a yotsuba anime.

698
00:38:09,864 --> 00:38:11,819
Speaker 0: I could watch that it's never gonna exist, but I want it.

699
00:38:12,302 --> 00:38:14,089
Speaker 1: I almost don't want it to be like.

700
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:15,737
Speaker 1: I'd like it to be full episodes.

701
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:21,186
Speaker 1: Like I was among Adil I would also like it to be shorts Like just little shorts.

702
00:38:21,447 --> 00:38:24,420
Speaker 0: I also don't want it to just be a direct adaptation of the manga.

703
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:28,156
Speaker 0: I wanted to just be like make more yotsuba episodes that aren't in the manga.

704
00:38:28,196 --> 00:38:28,678
Speaker 0: So it's like.

705
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:30,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, you had to see both.

706
00:38:32,023 --> 00:38:33,928
Speaker 1: You get you get Osmo to write it right?

707
00:38:33,948 --> 00:38:38,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, but with assistance from and direction from oshi.

708
00:38:38,138 --> 00:38:39,461
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

709
00:38:39,481 --> 00:38:40,786
Speaker 0: you do yotsuba very well.

710
00:38:40,967 --> 00:38:41,810
Speaker 0: He's good at comedy.

711
00:38:41,850 --> 00:38:42,412
Speaker 0: Just hates it.

712
00:38:42,633 --> 00:38:44,440
Speaker 0: No, no, I think there are other people who do better.

713
00:38:44,943 --> 00:38:46,251
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you just get the people did.

714
00:38:46,271 --> 00:38:47,297
Speaker 0: I was among a dad to do it.

715
00:38:47,478 --> 00:38:49,992
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I don't even know who was on that project.

716
00:38:50,012 --> 00:38:50,535
Speaker 1: I don't know hand.

717
00:38:50,575 --> 00:38:51,380
Speaker 1: I have to look it up.

718
00:38:51,642 --> 00:38:56,151
Speaker 0: You know, there's also I kinda you know I do kind of like, you know the kind of.

719
00:38:56,231 --> 00:39:00,967
Speaker 0: there is some stuff they don't make anymore like Really stupid crazy racist stuff.

720
00:39:01,048 --> 00:39:02,090
Speaker 0: Like what was that?

721
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:04,678
Speaker 0: That's that show with the school of full of bad kids.

722
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:11,470
Speaker 0: Oh the one I Forget it was like even with the predecessor of chromardier.

723
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,758
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like yeah Oh to kojuku.

724
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:14,340
Speaker 1: That was it.

725
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:15,947
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a show is pretty great.

726
00:39:16,209 --> 00:39:17,213
Speaker 0: I want stuff like that.

727
00:39:17,253 --> 00:39:22,174
Speaker 0: That doesn't exist anymore You know, they totally badass off-the-wall fucked up shit.

728
00:39:22,495 --> 00:39:23,780
Speaker 0: Well, there's probably shouldn't exist.

729
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:36,980
Speaker 1: Before where there's the like there was the old style of zany anime comedy like Ron Mar or something Yeah, and then we moved into a newer style of zany comedy the Excel saga style.

730
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:39,638
Speaker 1: Mmm, I heard someone made a pretty good edit of Excel saga.

731
00:39:40,624 --> 00:39:43,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, which Excel saga I think is just Pedro.

732
00:39:43,661 --> 00:39:48,140
Speaker 0: It's what leads into like, you know YouTube poop and those sorts of things that we have nowadays.

733
00:39:48,524 --> 00:39:49,799
Speaker 1: Anime world order said it best.

734
00:39:50,647 --> 00:39:51,172
Speaker 1: Was it them?

735
00:39:51,294 --> 00:39:51,940
Speaker 1: someone said this?

736
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:52,682
Speaker 1: I don't remember who.

737
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:57,920
Speaker 1: that Excel saga is the best anime in the world for anime fans.

738
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,939
Speaker 1: So we're in this very narrow time window.

739
00:40:00,341 --> 00:40:17,451
Speaker 1: You have to have just seen enough anime to kind of get the jokes or at least get that they're referring to other anime You may not have seen and yet haven't seen enough anime to realize that the show is actually just random Family Guy bullshit Mmm like in that golden up like that golden window.

740
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:19,879
Speaker 1: That is one of the funniest shows you will ever see.

741
00:40:20,341 --> 00:40:22,695
Speaker 0: Pretty funny when we were in that golden window.

742
00:40:22,715 --> 00:40:30,548
Speaker 1: Yeah But I think back at what I laughed at and it's not that funny to me now But I can see why I laughed at it back then.

743
00:40:30,568 --> 00:40:31,411
Speaker 1: Mmm.

744
00:40:32,295 --> 00:40:33,660
Speaker 0: I never did finish it me either.

745
00:40:34,921 --> 00:40:39,140
Speaker 0: Wasn't there something with like a the last episode porn basically or something?

746
00:40:40,142 --> 00:40:46,830
Speaker 1: It's porn in the same way that the second Wander not wanders, but El Hazzard OAV was kind of horny and stupid.

747
00:40:46,850 --> 00:40:49,759
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, except I heard this was more porny.

748
00:40:50,243 --> 00:40:51,393
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was more stupid.

749
00:40:51,434 --> 00:40:52,039
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

750
00:40:53,181 --> 00:40:53,442
Speaker 1: You know what?

751
00:40:53,483 --> 00:40:58,180
Speaker 1: I could actually go for another like El Hazzard style fantasy comedy.

752
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:02,195
Speaker 0: Yeah, nobody, you know all the fantasy shows these days are just so.

753
00:41:02,657 --> 00:41:05,569
Speaker 1: slayers is good But slayers isn't really the same genre.

754
00:41:05,610 --> 00:41:23,772
Speaker 1: slayers is almost a fighting show Yeah, but like El Hazzard not the best show in the world but the kind of show that's a serious fantasy esque plot in an interesting original world and yet is just kind of Constant low-level comedy throughout the otherwise serious plot.

755
00:41:24,153 --> 00:41:26,019
Speaker 0: or you know, just even just go for the.

756
00:41:26,179 --> 00:41:29,454
Speaker 0: you know Something just in the old style right where you know, look at Genji.

757
00:41:29,474 --> 00:41:34,010
Speaker 0: Ken for example is like, you know Has the school plus the something right Haru?

758
00:41:34,030 --> 00:41:36,940
Speaker 0: He has the school plus the sci-fi weirdness, whatever.

759
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:38,399
Speaker 0: I haven't even seen it, but I know that's what it has.

760
00:41:39,224 --> 00:41:52,953
Speaker 0: And in the same way Mahoutsukai tie has the school plus the Right, so give me the show that you know, too many of the shows nowadays are like, you know school plus something Crappy, you know.

761
00:41:54,062 --> 00:41:55,688
Speaker 1: So give me something good.

762
00:41:55,708 --> 00:42:03,318
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like if you're gonna bring in, you know The school part combine it with the awesome sci-fi part going back.

763
00:42:03,338 --> 00:42:07,211
Speaker 0: and well Remember even Evangelion is school plus sci-fi.

764
00:42:07,472 --> 00:42:10,160
Speaker 1: remember full metal panic, right?

765
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:17,215
Speaker 1: But that originally was school funny Which is pretty funny even though kind of cliche and semi serious average robot action.

766
00:42:17,295 --> 00:42:20,908
Speaker 1: and what part of that was popular The school bullshit and they made fumafu.

767
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:22,554
Speaker 0: Yeah, which is just the school part.

768
00:42:22,615 --> 00:42:23,438
Speaker 1: It was terrible.

769
00:42:23,719 --> 00:42:32,680
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I think the thing was is that you know The the school part was so bleh and the military part because I did watch the entire first series back in the day.

770
00:42:33,302 --> 00:42:34,707
Speaker 0: That the military part.

771
00:42:34,768 --> 00:42:35,952
Speaker 0: I didn't read the comic though.

772
00:42:36,635 --> 00:42:39,162
Speaker 0: The military part was just so Average.

773
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:41,088
Speaker 0: there was just nothing great about it.

774
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:41,550
Speaker 0: Nothing bad.

775
00:42:41,590 --> 00:42:48,435
Speaker 0: It was it was like a. it was like a boring generic Plot of a video game where you piloted a mech or something like that.

776
00:42:48,475 --> 00:42:49,439
Speaker 0: It was literally like this.

777
00:42:49,519 --> 00:42:52,449
Speaker 1: bad Whoo now contrast it with remember Gasaraki.

778
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:57,082
Speaker 1: Yeah, right same deal in that it's a boring slow Military.

779
00:42:57,243 --> 00:42:59,972
Speaker 1: but yet Gasaraki pulled me the fuck in.

780
00:42:59,992 --> 00:43:02,180
Speaker 0: I know we're the only people who like that show.

781
00:43:02,381 --> 00:43:05,016
Speaker 1: We got to watch that again and review it, but I think that's a good show.

782
00:43:05,036 --> 00:43:05,700
Speaker 0: We done a show.

783
00:43:05,941 --> 00:43:06,724
Speaker 1: No, we haven't.

784
00:43:06,885 --> 00:43:07,688
Speaker 1: Holy fuck.

785
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:08,572
Speaker 1: We gotta go.

786
00:43:08,612 --> 00:43:09,014
Speaker 1: I'll get it.

787
00:43:09,154 --> 00:43:09,516
Speaker 1: I'll get it.

788
00:43:09,556 --> 00:43:09,978
Speaker 1: We'll watch it.

789
00:43:10,701 --> 00:43:12,288
Speaker 0: We have a the V dubbed VHS tape.

790
00:43:12,349 --> 00:43:14,860
Speaker 0: then we got rid of those and not like we have a VHS player.

791
00:43:14,981 --> 00:43:16,487
Speaker 1: Anyway, I still do actually.

792
00:43:16,969 --> 00:43:17,692
Speaker 0: Oh, does it work?

793
00:43:17,933 --> 00:43:18,174
Speaker 1: Yes.

794
00:43:18,214 --> 00:43:19,058
Speaker 1: I'm getting rid of it though.

795
00:43:19,199 --> 00:43:25,460
Speaker 1: Okay Hey anyone out there you want what was once a four thousand dollar top of the line VHS camcorder.

796
00:43:26,023 --> 00:43:27,007
Speaker 0: Oh the camcorder.

797
00:43:27,047 --> 00:43:28,012
Speaker 1: It's also a VCR.

798
00:43:28,152 --> 00:43:28,554
Speaker 0: All right.

799
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:28,976
Speaker 0: Yeah.

800
00:43:29,177 --> 00:43:33,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Gasaraki Was I like shows like that too?

801
00:43:33,286 --> 00:43:34,750
Speaker 1: Because it was very focused.

802
00:43:35,231 --> 00:43:40,823
Speaker 0: it Gasaraki perfect collection on Amazon 77 66.

803
00:43:40,823 --> 00:43:41,606
Speaker 1: I'll get it somewhere.

804
00:43:41,787 --> 00:43:42,510
Speaker 0: Let me check elsewhere.

805
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:52,827
Speaker 1: I will get it somehow anyway, but What got me about Gasaraki is that a lot of anime and I think I've kind of pinpointed what it is that I like other than ghosts in the shell.

806
00:43:53,712 --> 00:44:04,769
Speaker 1: if you if I start watching a show and There's a moment like when you read a book you watch a movie or your brain like you suddenly see I know where this is Going there's gonna be drama about X. I don't give a shit.

807
00:44:05,251 --> 00:44:18,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, anytime I predict that like I feel like Now they're gonna have a misunderstanding About this and that's gonna be the driving plot point when I expect that and it doesn't happen Like the show totally goes a different direction.

808
00:44:19,242 --> 00:44:20,351
Speaker 1: That almost guarantees.

809
00:44:20,412 --> 00:44:20,674
Speaker 1: It's a show.

810
00:44:20,694 --> 00:44:21,198
Speaker 1: I'm gonna like.

811
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:25,948
Speaker 1: Gasaraki was Surprisingly not stereotypical.

812
00:44:25,968 --> 00:44:27,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've never.

813
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:29,802
Speaker 0: I'm sure there are other shows like that But I haven't.

814
00:44:30,325 --> 00:44:40,098
Speaker 1: parts of some Gundams are like that parts Pocket and less like more original Gundam.

815
00:44:40,138 --> 00:44:42,584
Speaker 0: see On Gundam seeds.

816
00:44:42,625 --> 00:44:45,314
Speaker 0: that shall not be named right, you know, give me the show.

817
00:44:45,394 --> 00:44:46,217
Speaker 0: Give me the Gundam show.

Speaker 0: I know the.

822
00:44:54,044 --> 00:44:58,340
Speaker 0: give me another Gundam seed just like Gundam seed but not Gundam seed.

823
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:02,840

824
00:45:02,961 --> 00:45:05,759
Speaker 0: But it's like actually, you know what don't give me a Gundam, right?

825
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:18,414

826
00:45:18,474 --> 00:45:20,080
Speaker 0: that just keeps you hooked the whole time.

827
