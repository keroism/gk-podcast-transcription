1
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:19,378
Speaker 1: It's the geek nuts book club, and we are back on this spooky Thursday October 26th, it's scary because we read the book club in a reasonable amount of time.

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:22,464
Speaker 0: who's So?

3
00:00:22,484 --> 00:00:29,159
Speaker 1: it's interesting That the fifth season is the fourth way.

4
00:00:29,883 --> 00:00:30,365
Speaker 1: Why?

5
00:00:30,626 --> 00:00:33,800
Speaker 1: because at the very end we find out that the moon eats your soul?

6
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:36,195
Speaker 1: What's the leather?

7
00:00:36,558 --> 00:00:38,304
Speaker 1: I Spoilers the book club.

8
00:00:38,745 --> 00:00:43,060
Speaker 1: We are assuming you have already read the fifth season by NK Jemisin.

9
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:45,651
Speaker 1: If you have not read it, you're gonna want.

10
00:00:45,671 --> 00:00:47,700

00:00:48,967 --> 00:00:49,739
Speaker 1: I suggest you read it.

12
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:58,920
Speaker 1: There are many other geek nights book club episodes that we have done such books as the Wheel of Time and the Prince of Nothing Right, so I chose this book because I'd heard a lot about it.

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:00,870
Speaker 0: You know, this is it happens a lot.

14
00:01:00,890 --> 00:01:02,679
Speaker 0: I say this often but I'm gonna keep saying it.

15
00:01:03,021 --> 00:01:04,486
Speaker 0: You hang out in nerdy communities.

16
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,880
Speaker 0: You hear something mentioned over and over and over again.

17
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,747
Speaker 0: Just keeps getting mentioned and mentioned and mentioned.

18
00:01:09,767 --> 00:01:11,795
Speaker 0: you're like, oh this thing keeps have.

19
00:01:11,855 --> 00:01:15,268
Speaker 0: Oh gabbo gabbo It's like I keep hearing about this.

20
00:01:15,408 --> 00:01:19,564
Speaker 0: I should check it out at some point and then the book club is like well I have to pick a book.

21
00:01:19,886 --> 00:01:20,931
Speaker 0: Hey, how about that one?

22
00:01:20,971 --> 00:01:21,895
Speaker 0: I keep hearing about.

23
00:01:22,096 --> 00:01:22,920
Speaker 0: oh, what's that?

24
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:26,499
Speaker 0: It won the Hugo award and the sequel won the Hugo award the year after.

25
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:34,398
Speaker 0: Interesting and I saw the author at gamer X's last year and she was cool talking about Dragon Age or whatever.

26
00:01:34,418 --> 00:01:37,545
Speaker 0: and it's like Alright, this seems good to me.

27
00:01:37,565 --> 00:01:38,207
Speaker 0: Yep.

28
00:01:38,548 --> 00:01:42,500
Speaker 1: So I really enjoyed this book like straight up and I'm gonna read the other the next two.

29
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:47,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a fantasy sci-fi novel of high quality.

30
00:01:47,281 --> 00:01:50,392
Speaker 1: It did not disappoint and I like I did very much enjoy.

31
00:01:50,412 --> 00:01:51,977
Speaker 1: and again last chance.

32
00:01:52,017 --> 00:01:52,840
Speaker 1: We're gonna spoil it.

33
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:54,091
Speaker 1: We're gonna assume you read it.

34
00:01:54,414 --> 00:01:54,535
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

35
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:58,473
Speaker 1: Enjoy the fact that it starts with the end of the world.

36
00:01:58,493 --> 00:01:59,215
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

37
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:00,299
Speaker 0: Well, there's a lot of world.

38
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:02,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, it starts with the end of the world.

39
00:02:03,322 --> 00:02:08,119
Speaker 1: It starts to set the the idea of what does it mean for a world to end?

40
00:02:08,620 --> 00:02:13,720
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and then it jumps into all these different stories that are actually just different parts of the same story.

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,462
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the.

42
00:02:14,482 --> 00:02:18,757
Speaker 0: I think that is the number one genius part of this book right is that we saw?

43
00:02:18,837 --> 00:02:27,112
Speaker 0: we already read Hyperion which did a Canterbury tale Situation and here you think you're sort of getting that right?

44
00:02:27,132 --> 00:02:33,904
Speaker 0: You've got these different stories of different characters, you know even Prince of Nothing does the same thing where you Different every chapter.

45
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:40,860
Speaker 0: it goes to a different part of the story focused on a different character and just like snatch, you know At some point they're all gonna crash into each other.

46
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,263
Speaker 1: So do I know spoiler here, but if you ever watch Westworld the new one, which is one is fantastic Does the same thing.

47
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,674
Speaker 1: it does something very similar.

48
00:02:49,694 --> 00:02:53,960
Speaker 1: that is It's very similar and very well done and amazing.

49
00:02:54,301 --> 00:03:01,000
Speaker 0: So in this book, I got a little suspicious early on because the stories really didn't fit with each other.

50
00:03:01,043 --> 00:03:03,969
Speaker 1: well Well one of them fit with the other two one fit.

51
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:06,658
Speaker 1: one of them was the world's fucking end.

52
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:06,879
Speaker 0: right.

53
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:11,240
Speaker 0: one of them It's like there is a season happening and the other ones people are just like hey, what's up?

54
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:12,789
Speaker 0: And I'm like, how could I'm like?

55
00:03:12,829 --> 00:03:14,540
Speaker 0: is the season really far away from them?

56
00:03:14,801 --> 00:03:26,569
Speaker 0: Like I went to look at the map and try to figure it out because basically you have this world Where they've got spring summer winter fall, but they also have what they call our seasons or the fifth season Which is just apocalypse world.

57
00:03:26,609 --> 00:03:28,180
Speaker 1: the RPG guard your gates.

58
00:03:28,281 --> 00:03:39,660
Speaker 0: There are different Apocalypses that happen randomly throughout history and they always end up winning in the end and they don't completely wipe out humanity But they do a bunch of damage effectively erasing civilization.

59
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:50,876
Speaker 0: well, and you can see the remnants of the previous civilizations densives which makes you and that's how you know that your sieve is at Least better than theirs because they if they were better than you they would they wouldn't be alive.

60
00:03:50,916 --> 00:03:54,599
Speaker 0: and well at the same time It's still being alive proves that you're doing better than them.

61
00:03:55,021 --> 00:03:56,627
Speaker 1: It's how you quote unquote.

62
00:03:56,647 --> 00:04:06,083
Speaker 1: know because it's very interesting to see this overarching theme that Over time a world like this because at the end of the book you get the appendix that later on a world That's super dangerous.

63
00:04:06,144 --> 00:04:10,377
Speaker 0: It reminds immediately reminded me of the end of game.

64
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:11,200
Speaker 0: a player of games.

65
00:04:11,321 --> 00:04:14,360
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but the warrior planet with the fire planet.

66
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:17,779
Speaker 0: This is a ring of fire going around and burning it over and over again.

67
00:04:17,921 --> 00:04:23,480
Speaker 0: They could they live on the planet as soon as the fire goes away And then they wait a long time and the fire comes back and they run away.

68
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,786
Speaker 1: I think the fire is going in a ring.

69
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:28,020
Speaker 1: They just always stay ahead of the ring like in that moving castle or whatever.

70
00:04:28,201 --> 00:04:32,302
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever, but that totally reminded me of that Immediately,

71
00:04:32,502 --> 00:04:45,060
Speaker 1: but the conventional wisdom of this world is interesting because there's definitely this very strong idea At least from our main character and all the schooling that brought her to the point that she was at that

72
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:46,188
Speaker 0: any

73
00:04:46,309 --> 00:04:56,060
Speaker 1: remnant of Any civilization any calm anything that didn't survive a season is clearly worthless because they're dead and we're still alive.

74
00:04:56,710 --> 00:05:01,891
Speaker 1: therefore Anything that is old and didn't survive is worthless and you should avoid it.

75
00:05:02,313 --> 00:05:10,039
Speaker 1: and over time you have the society that is increasingly Hyper-static and hyper focused on these very narrow avenues of success.

76
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:19,949
Speaker 1: But then you look at the time scales and the actual time frame between these seasons Can be thousands and thousands of years

77
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:35,625
Speaker 0: and then somehow this stone lore has lasted, you know Even though they don't care about old things This stone lore is somewhat old enough that they like know about these old seasons Even if they're so old, but they don't know about like these Obelisks that are flying around.

78
00:05:35,946 --> 00:05:42,125
Speaker 1: Ah, but they don't care about the obelisks because the obelisks are clearly a relic of a sieve That didn't make it therefore.

79
00:05:42,486 --> 00:05:46,379
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter what the stone lore is a relic of a sieve that didn't make it do.

80
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:56,893
Speaker 1: no Because the stone lore is passed down among the sieves that survive Anyway, but they literally they ignore the relics especially the obelisks at least ostensibly.

81
00:05:56,913 --> 00:06:00,743
Speaker 1: and the argument is the obelisks are a relic of Society that failed.

82
00:06:00,783 --> 00:06:06,580
Speaker 1: therefore whatever they are should be ignored because the people who didn't didn't ignore them didn't make it.

83
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,625
Speaker 1: So what the fuck did they be?

84
00:06:07,686 --> 00:06:08,953
Speaker 0: who made them didn't make it.

85
00:06:09,456 --> 00:06:13,880
Speaker 1: but obviously That is kind of false reasoning

86
00:06:14,201 --> 00:06:15,444
Speaker 0: Obviously, especially

87
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:32,240
Speaker 1: in light of the fact that these seasons can be thousands and thousands of years apart and this other overarching theme that Whether or not any individual civilization survives a season Seems to come down to not really stone lower but luck because sometimes just get fucked.

88
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:39,020
Speaker 1: The reality is that these seasons are by and large caused by things beyond the understanding and control of anyone involved.

89
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:44,787
Speaker 0: It's just a super super fucking dangerous world where all this awful shit happens all the time And it's everything sucks.

90
00:06:44,908 --> 00:06:53,779
Speaker 0: So a better more dangerous than the earth We live on like and like if the cow Aren't you like them super caldera out in Yellowstone or whatever that everyone's always afraid of?

91
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:56,962
Speaker 0: Yeah imagine if that blew up and like that was a Constant fear.

92
00:06:57,002 --> 00:07:02,321
Speaker 0: like actually that people actually worried about that all the time and there were many other things like it and not just that One.

93
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:06,516
Speaker 1: but imagine if they were afraid of that all the time and the last time it blew up was 10,000 years ago.

94
00:07:06,576 --> 00:07:13,560
Speaker 1: and yet 10,000 years later Everyone still is prepared for that exact same bullshit.

95
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:16,133
Speaker 0: But other horrible things like it are also on.

96
00:07:16,193 --> 00:07:17,540
Speaker 0: the could happen at any time.

97
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,651
Speaker 1: But I guess the fundamental reasoning of that civil is there.

98
00:07:21,672 --> 00:07:26,069
Speaker 1: those people is our main character in relation to Ignore the dead civs.

99
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:27,458
Speaker 1: They clearly didn't make it.

100
00:07:28,262 --> 00:07:32,840
Speaker 1: I feel like the overarching story of the next two books will be how false that reasoning is.

101
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:42,224
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the the book starts to lead you on with this Canterbury tale focusing on different characters and yet then it pulls a switch I've never seen before.

102
00:07:42,505 --> 00:07:44,091
Speaker 0: I mean it's it's it's sort of like.

103
00:07:44,132 --> 00:07:46,240
Speaker 0: it seems like an obvious thing that someone could have done.

104
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,430
Speaker 0: Maybe someone did but I've never seen it before where haha.

105
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:52,300
Speaker 0: It's all the same character at different points in their own life.

106
00:07:52,401 --> 00:08:01,640
Speaker 0: It's just that that character's life was so Different at different points in her life the main character her childhood her upbringing her old light or meet a middle-aged life.

107
00:08:02,101 --> 00:08:02,804
Speaker 0: We don't see her old life.

108
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:20,175
Speaker 0: It was her life was so different and she changed her name so many times And became a different person so that the three different stories really seem like different people and then you realize it's all the same person Gradually, like I Scott suspicious, but it's like how could it be?

109
00:08:20,215 --> 00:08:21,220
Speaker 0: These worlds are so different.

110
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,196
Speaker 0: This one's in a season and this one's not.

111
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:30,706
Speaker 0: and this one You know, it's like how could this can't possibly be the same, you know, and then eventually it's like no It is exactly what I suspected.

112
00:08:31,087 --> 00:08:32,652
Speaker 0: good move well played well played.

113
00:08:32,852 --> 00:08:48,802
Speaker 1: so in light of everything I said before there's another point that the book makes repeatedly and very explicitly that the most interesting story about a thing like a history of people or whatever is to notice the things that are Conspicuously lacking.

114
00:08:48,822 --> 00:08:50,605
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm that you wouldn't think about.

115
00:08:50,665 --> 00:08:52,908
Speaker 1: like is there something that never gets brought up?

116
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:55,912
Speaker 1: What's the elephant in the room and The?

117
00:08:55,992 --> 00:09:02,570
Speaker 1: this point is reinforced gradually as you see things like no one cares about the stars because why would you ever look up when?

118
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:03,742
Speaker 1: All the dangers below you.

119
00:09:03,762 --> 00:09:10,881
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Like she don't even our main character doesn't think about the stars until she's out on an island Which she didn't think people lived on.

120
00:09:10,941 --> 00:09:12,049
Speaker 1: and there's people out there.

121
00:09:12,572 --> 00:09:15,164
Speaker 1: No one talks about islands cuz clearly people don't live on islands.

122
00:09:15,305 --> 00:09:16,290
Speaker 0: islands are hella dangerous.

123
00:09:16,491 --> 00:09:20,207
Speaker 1: But then there's these people on this island who appear to have been living there for a long time.

124
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:27,130
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And when she was in the stone Lord and you just try you have faith in the stone Lord cuz that's what's keeping you alive.

125
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,904
Speaker 0: But well, there's people who don't know about her doing just fine.

126
00:09:29,924 --> 00:09:37,978
Speaker 0: There's a world outside Outside of the occurs, you know, yeah the mind trap that has been made for you by the society The society is really restrictive right?

127
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:40,450
Speaker 0: It's like they have these use casts, right?

128
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,070
Speaker 0: It's like you're in a particular use cast.

129
00:09:42,239 --> 00:09:43,593
Speaker 1: Yeah Your last your last.

130
00:09:43,633 --> 00:09:45,639
Speaker 1: your name is basically your first name.

131
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,622
Speaker 1: how you why?

132
00:09:46,702 --> 00:09:49,590
Speaker 1: why you are useful Scott what city you live in Scott?

133
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,159
Speaker 0: Computer person, New York.

134
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:53,150
Speaker 1: Yeah rim computer person, New York, right?

135
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:53,555
Speaker 0: It's like.

136
00:09:53,882 --> 00:09:58,244
Speaker 0: so It's like and that that's what you do in life and you obey the stone lore.

137
00:09:58,304 --> 00:10:00,110
Speaker 0: and the stone lore you just take as granted.

138
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:02,765
Speaker 0: You're not really questioning anything take it for granted.

139
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:07,710
Speaker 0: Yeah You know and you just try as an origin joke.

140
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:09,917
Speaker 0: You're just trying to survive in this awful world.

141
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:20,204
Speaker 1: and but all these little things around that that point of what is missing Like what is not talked about and there's subtle things like the stars of the islands like she literally islands don't exist because why would?

142
00:10:20,224 --> 00:10:20,767
Speaker 1: I would live on them.

143
00:10:20,787 --> 00:10:33,593
Speaker 1: and then oh there's people on the island and it sort of makes sense because Even if people settled on that island right after the previous season they could live there for thousands and thousands of years Before another season.

144
00:10:33,734 --> 00:10:38,649
Speaker 1: Yeah, very few civilizations on a real earth have made it thousands of years, right?

145
00:10:39,911 --> 00:10:41,410
Speaker 0: That's another thing is that this is trope.

146
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:51,639
Speaker 0: I see a lot that we I talk about a lot where of the sci-fi thing where the people are trapped in physically trapped right in the dome like or Logan's run.

147
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:57,244
Speaker 0: Yep, or What's the one we did for the book club where they were underground with it with the helmets?

148
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:02,026
Speaker 1: Oh Already forgot, you know the one yeah, but I already forgot with that book.

149
00:11:02,046 --> 00:11:10,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway There's a lot of these sci-fi fantasy books or whatever, especially sci-fi where the people are sort of physically trapped in some location.

150
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:11,715
Speaker 0: They don't know about the outside world.

151
00:11:11,836 --> 00:11:15,409
Speaker 0: anime does it a lot where there's a wall around the society or something, right?

152
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:20,690
Speaker 0: You know big O is sort of one of those the inside and outside the dome situation.

153
00:11:21,711 --> 00:11:25,509
Speaker 0: But here there's no physical trap really, right?

154
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:28,698
Speaker 0: Even though many of the the soul as well.

155
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:30,966
Speaker 0: Well, that's the one, you know wool over your eyes, right?

156
00:11:30,986 --> 00:11:31,789
Speaker 0: We should have figured that out.

157
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:45,180
Speaker 0: But Here instead of doing a thing like Logan's run where they're physically trapped in some horrible dystopian society underground they can Physically freely roam everywhere, but the origins can't.

158
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,730
Speaker 0: the origins are effectively trapped sort of but there's no There's no physical wall around all of society.

159
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:58,741
Speaker 1: People could just get on a boat like that island I Island where they keep pirating like no one went and got them because no one.

160
00:11:59,022 --> 00:12:01,210
Speaker 1: everyone assumed that it was some other local calm.

161
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:17,990
Speaker 0: but the point is is that there's still this mental wall around the society and thus a lot of the same things that happen in Stories that follow that trope happen in this like oh We've discovered this hidden society of people outside of the society civilization that we were aware of.

162
00:12:18,292 --> 00:12:20,830
Speaker 0: Oh, you know we learn things that you know.

163
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:26,570
Speaker 0: There's actually this whole other way of life and other things going on that were kept secret from us all this time.

164
00:12:26,730 --> 00:12:34,567
Speaker 0: Right as all those same things happen in the fifth season Even though it doesn't have the same premise of the trope.

165
00:12:34,908 --> 00:12:43,625
Speaker 1: Nope So in terms of those absences again Uh, the moon is never mentioned at any point in the book the nail of heaven.

166
00:12:44,026 --> 00:12:52,610
Speaker 1: and then actually the North Stars Yeah, and then the moon is Literally the last line of the book of you ever heard of the moon?

167
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's like what.

168
00:12:54,799 --> 00:12:59,779
Speaker 1: so I saw that coming from Pretty early out like almost after.

169
00:12:59,939 --> 00:13:10,490
Speaker 1: after that long explicit bit about like look for the absences And then all the bitch with stars and everything I realized and I started paying attention to about a third of the way through the book that the moon was never mentioned ever.

170
00:13:12,214 --> 00:13:17,807
Speaker 1: She was outside looking up and talking about the stars like the idea of the moon never really came up ever.

171
00:13:18,549 --> 00:13:23,203
Speaker 1: and then there was another bit where the they start talking about.

172
00:13:23,304 --> 00:13:24,969
Speaker 1: why is the evil earth so pissed?

173
00:13:24,989 --> 00:13:32,870
Speaker 1: and They no one really remembers, but wasn't the oral legend something like the people of Earth killed his son?

174
00:13:35,912 --> 00:13:37,440
Speaker 1: Who could be the son of the earth?

175
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,369
Speaker 1: perhaps the moon in a world like this?

176
00:13:41,352 --> 00:13:48,849
Speaker 1: And then also there was a point where they said that maybe it wasn't his son But some people say that they destroyed his favorite glass knife.

177
00:13:49,854 --> 00:14:02,490
Speaker 1: They destroyed the earth's favorite glass knife and near the end Reinforcing my idea that the moon was gonna be evil earth's son when the alabaster shows up after he destroyed the world Really started the destruction.

178
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:08,307
Speaker 1: There's that big glass knife and leaning on the wall and she's like what's that?

179
00:14:08,407 --> 00:14:08,929
Speaker 1: and he's like.

180
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:13,465
Speaker 1: And there's nonsense about it and it seems to be tied to the same thing.

181
00:14:13,505 --> 00:14:14,930
Speaker 1: that's tied to him bringing up the moon.

182
00:14:15,411 --> 00:14:15,973
Speaker 1: Pretty sure.

183
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:21,010
Speaker 1: the whole rest of this is about what's up with the moon and why there isn't a moon anymore.

184
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:26,817
Speaker 0: There's definitely the secret past that I didn't think we're actually gonna see a lot of that, you know Terrible secret of the past.

185
00:14:26,877 --> 00:14:27,742
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna see it all.

186
00:14:27,782 --> 00:14:29,170
Speaker 1: I think the Guardians know a lot.

187
00:14:29,371 --> 00:14:31,140
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but then they're no good.

188
00:14:31,482 --> 00:14:42,138
Speaker 0: then as soon as we went to that place In that the Guardians had with like the room with a socket the socket It's like as soon as you saw that it's like shit son there is a terrible secret of space and I

189
00:14:42,179 --> 00:14:45,372
Speaker 1: gotta know that was one of my favorite scenes because Mm-hmm.

190
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:48,210
Speaker 0: You there's a secret you went from not even knowing about it.

191
00:14:48,511 --> 00:14:53,310
Speaker 0: Usually it's like this is looming terrible secret of space like ooh, what's in the thing?

192
00:14:53,430 --> 00:14:55,959
Speaker 0: We're not gonna tell you to like chapter 10.

193
00:14:55,959 --> 00:14:58,870
Speaker 0: It's like we're gonna reveal you the thing exists and go there right away.

194
00:14:58,910 --> 00:15:05,710
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh snap, not only that but they reveal it They don't tell you what it is and then immediately like that Guardian shows up and that other nonsense happens.

195
00:15:06,172 --> 00:15:16,070
Speaker 1: And then that Guardian takes her aside and she thinks always gonna kill me or she's gonna kill me Like I'm done and that Guardians I'm getting killed instead, but instead the Guardians like so did you touch it and she's like what?

196
00:15:17,271 --> 00:15:17,914
Speaker 1: Did you touch it?

197
00:15:17,954 --> 00:15:20,830
Speaker 0: That's important because the Guardian thought she knew more than she knew.

198
00:15:21,311 --> 00:15:24,101
Speaker 1: Yep, and then you learn a bunch but you don't learn enough.

199
00:15:24,161 --> 00:15:29,579
Speaker 1: and then the other Guardian comes in and pulls the chip out of Guardians brain and yeah, this is something it's like.

200
00:15:29,599 --> 00:15:32,027
Speaker 0: the Guardians are like the most fascinating thing right?

201
00:15:32,087 --> 00:15:47,410
Speaker 0: because okay So you got normal people then you got origins which are as powerful as wizards in the Prince of Nothing or they are Like in Dune where all the magic is based on the spice And the ecology of the planet Arrakis in here in the fifth season.

202
00:15:47,651 --> 00:15:51,120
Speaker 0: All of the magic is based on rocks and geology.

203
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:59,724
Speaker 1: Yep, right to the point that they don't they call scientists Geomasts because all science is rooted in the earth because that's the most important thing right?

204
00:15:59,845 --> 00:16:01,310
Speaker 0: Everything is about geology here.

205
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,277
Speaker 0: The magic is powered by geology.

206
00:16:03,377 --> 00:16:07,090
Speaker 0: Everything's geology and the people who practice wizardry, right?

207
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,739
Speaker 0: There are some of the people just you know, they're pretty much just born.

208
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:10,342
Speaker 0: Oh crap.

209
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:11,627
Speaker 0: I'm born a wizard.

210
00:16:11,667 --> 00:16:12,470
Speaker 0: I have magic powers.

211
00:16:12,593 --> 00:16:13,268
Speaker 0: I'm dangerous.

212
00:16:14,451 --> 00:16:21,870
Speaker 0: They're basically treated like x-men, you know, there's the obvious allegory of you know, racism and persecution that's going on.

213
00:16:22,271 --> 00:16:24,679
Speaker 0: They have a racial slur for them.

214
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:25,582
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

215
00:16:25,682 --> 00:16:27,769
Speaker 0: it's pretty much the same story as x-men.

216
00:16:28,692 --> 00:16:31,783
Speaker 0: People are born with powers and then they're shunned by their families.

217
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:38,750
Speaker 0: Some of them are made useful Through training at Professor X's Academy and some of them are killed and some of them are horribly tortured.

218
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:41,665
Speaker 1: Professor X's Academy seems more like magnetos.

219
00:16:41,866 --> 00:16:42,590
Speaker 0: Yes, it does.

220
00:16:42,911 --> 00:16:46,669
Speaker 0: It's not the greatest but it does teach you skills and you get to go on missions to help.

221
00:16:46,910 --> 00:16:48,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, but there's where the Guardian is the most.

222
00:16:48,738 --> 00:16:58,646
Speaker 1: it because they're so unnerving and there's all these moments Where a guardian appears and you expect a certain sort of interaction to happen reading the book like alright this Guardians here They're right.

223
00:16:58,770 --> 00:17:07,535
Speaker 0: It's like these Guardians are presented as these people who run really running the show are even stronger than any origin Right there.

224
00:17:07,575 --> 00:17:10,869
Speaker 0: They can kick any x-men's ass with their magic powers, right?

225
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:13,698
Speaker 0: Everyone's super subservient to them no matter what you get.

226
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:17,750
Speaker 1: little things like alabaster tells her do not let him touch you with his skin.

227
00:17:17,991 --> 00:17:21,883
Speaker 0: Right, they constantly have this like question of like who's who's the ball?

228
00:17:21,903 --> 00:17:23,428
Speaker 0: who is the boss of the Guardians?

229
00:17:23,468 --> 00:17:23,950
Speaker 0: and you don't know.

230
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:24,753
Speaker 0: It's a super mystery.

231
00:17:24,794 --> 00:17:26,441
Speaker 0: It must be God or something who even knows.

232
00:17:26,461 --> 00:17:28,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, so Guardians are super scary.

233
00:17:29,032 --> 00:17:36,522
Speaker 0: Yet even though some of the Guardians act in a super scary way Some of the main one is like super cool and he doesn't.

234
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:40,178
Speaker 1: well, it's more most of the time They're inscrutable.

235
00:17:40,218 --> 00:17:44,861
Speaker 1: the actions that they take Take me as the reader by surprise.

236
00:17:44,901 --> 00:17:51,868
Speaker 0: like that one shows up when alabaster They don't follow any pattern of what you would expect from that kind of character in any other story.

237
00:17:52,089 --> 00:17:58,251
Speaker 1: Yep Well the one that shows up in the town that gets destroyed by the volcano it just immediately tries to kill them Mm-hmm.

238
00:17:58,612 --> 00:18:02,384
Speaker 1: There's the one the the main one who shows up again after he.

239
00:18:02,404 --> 00:18:05,276
Speaker 0: so he's like the super cool character I just like him so much.

240
00:18:05,356 --> 00:18:06,644
Speaker 1: Oh, he's a great character.

241
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:07,026
Speaker 0: It's like.

242
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:07,931
Speaker 0: that's the character It's like.

243
00:18:08,011 --> 00:18:09,435
Speaker 0: please go back to the character, please.

244
00:18:09,476 --> 00:18:10,338
Speaker 0: Please they're so awesome.

245
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:16,679
Speaker 1: the best character in the entire book However, is the sexy pie is the pirate captain.

246
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:17,823
Speaker 1: Oh that character.

247
00:18:17,843 --> 00:18:23,570
Speaker 1: I agree is the sexiest Person I have ever read about in fiction.

248
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:26,097
Speaker 1: Like I I am hard-pressed like.

249
00:18:26,157 --> 00:18:29,208
Speaker 1: this is occhio level but not evil as far as I can tell.

250
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:29,910
Speaker 1: he's just great.

251
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,094
Speaker 0: He's just awesome pirate guy.

252
00:18:31,294 --> 00:18:33,361
Speaker 0: You see it's like it was like a BK was sexy.

253
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, he seems to have no character flaws.

254
00:18:36,534 --> 00:18:43,206
Speaker 0: He's bisexual he's polyamorous He is hotter than God and a pirate and a good pirate.

255
00:18:43,306 --> 00:18:44,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's kinda wizard.

256
00:18:44,572 --> 00:18:47,289
Speaker 1: He's great at pirating, but he's also a good person.

257
00:18:47,811 --> 00:18:49,717
Speaker 1: Basically, everything about this guy is great.

258
00:18:49,797 --> 00:18:53,909
Speaker 1: It's like the one person you just want to win and then want to have sex with.

259
00:18:54,049 --> 00:18:55,680
Speaker 1: yep Yeah, yep, pretty much.

260
00:18:56,023 --> 00:19:04,570
Speaker 1: I love that bit where because obviously alabaster is Probably pretty gay and does not you know, there's probably he's the most gay.

261
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:08,817
Speaker 0: 99% again 999% again.

262
00:19:08,837 --> 00:19:10,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they're doing there.

263
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:12,698
Speaker 0: I knew that from like page two because it's like.

264
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,873
Speaker 0: she said the main character is sent to go like have sex with this Dude, right.

265
00:19:16,893 --> 00:19:25,383
Speaker 0: He's like because they're likely to have awesome wizard babies because they're both awesome wizards and She like doesn't want to do it because he also doesn't love it.

266
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,130
Speaker 0: But then he also doesn't want to do it.

267
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:27,856
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh he's gay.

268
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:28,400
Speaker 1: Yep.

269
00:19:28,763 --> 00:19:29,105
Speaker 0: He's gay.

270
00:19:29,186 --> 00:19:29,609
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm right.

271
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:31,608
Speaker 1: but then when the pirate captain like.

272
00:19:32,151 --> 00:19:37,170
Speaker 1: They both want him and the pirate captain wants both of them and the way that resolves into just okay.

273
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,035
Speaker 1: They're all together now.

274
00:19:38,055 --> 00:19:39,061
Speaker 0: Well, baby.

275
00:19:39,081 --> 00:19:40,409
Speaker 1: That's just how it goes.

276
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:41,710
Speaker 0: sexy sexy.

277
00:19:41,921 --> 00:19:42,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

278
00:19:42,211 --> 00:20:06,978
Speaker 1: though along those lines in general - in terms of aside from origins the way the rest of the world is presented is very interesting from a just like modern fiction perspective because There's trans characters there's gay characters skin colors all over the place and a lot of these attributes are very casually used and it's just I'm happy to see Interesting representation across a broad spectrum.

279
00:20:07,038 --> 00:20:11,170
Speaker 0: I mean this book is written by a nerdy black lady from Brooklyn.

280
00:20:11,451 --> 00:20:13,562
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I mean, I don't know what you expected.

281
00:20:13,582 --> 00:20:22,228
Speaker 0: I mean It's so not par for the course with fantasy fiction except for like Ursula K Le Guin or whatever.

282
00:20:22,268 --> 00:20:22,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, right?

283
00:20:22,931 --> 00:20:26,493
Speaker 0: So, you know, there you go Caradad Caradad torch.

284
00:20:26,754 --> 00:20:30,144
Speaker 1: Yep, but I very much enjoyed that aspect of these books a lot.

285
00:20:30,345 --> 00:20:34,737
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, but that pirate captain We can't get away from sexy pirate.

286
00:20:34,777 --> 00:20:41,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I started reading it because Emily's the only bad thing about sexy pirate captain He doesn't show up till later in the book and then he doesn't make it.

287
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:42,088
Speaker 0: Oh, no.

288
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:44,843
Speaker 1: Yeah He goes down in a pretty pretty awful way.

289
00:20:44,964 --> 00:20:54,467
Speaker 1: Oh, no Well, I mean the way he goes down Room tells us exactly why you don't want one of those Guardians to touch your skin with their skin.

290
00:20:54,487 --> 00:20:54,909
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

291
00:20:56,431 --> 00:20:57,656
Speaker 1: But now I read.

292
00:20:57,777 --> 00:21:00,107
Speaker 1: I really want to know what the secrets are and I want to know.

293
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:00,870
Speaker 1: I wanted everything.

294
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,235
Speaker 1: I want to read the rest of these.

295
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:06,410
Speaker 0: I've heard from some reliable people that book two and three are not on the same levels.

296
00:21:06,554 --> 00:21:08,093
Speaker 0: book one But it's like.

297
00:21:08,113 --> 00:21:09,257
Speaker 0: I don't understand how that could be.

298
00:21:09,357 --> 00:21:12,507
Speaker 0: book two also won the Hugo award and I don't know.

299
00:21:12,588 --> 00:21:17,350
Speaker 0: book three just came Out super recently and it's like how could that possibly be bad?

300
00:21:17,491 --> 00:21:19,850
Speaker 0: I can't even imagine but I'm gonna find out for myself.

301
00:21:20,011 --> 00:21:24,610
Speaker 0: I held back on reading more book two so that it wouldn't taint this episode of geek nights.

302
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:29,284
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I don't got a hold back anymore Except Mario Odyssey is coming out like this.

303
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:33,350
Speaker 0: Yeah Is there anything else to say about the fifties?

304
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:39,327
Speaker 0: Oh one thing I do want to say now about the is that even though this is I seem a three book series, right?

305
00:21:39,347 --> 00:21:42,730
Speaker 0: I Really actually feel like someone negative about the book.

306
00:21:42,891 --> 00:21:45,826
Speaker 0: I feel like you didn't really get your money's worth with book one.

307
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,713
Speaker 0: in terms of length I feel like it.

308
00:21:47,753 --> 00:21:52,207
Speaker 0: five hundred twelve pages sure, but it feels story wise.

309
00:21:52,308 --> 00:21:55,177
Speaker 0: it feels like essentially the way it ends.

310
00:21:55,719 --> 00:22:05,430
Speaker 0: it feels like it really is just like Is the three books could have been one book, you know, it doesn't feel like a three book Even though I haven't read book two or three.

311
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:07,095
Speaker 0: It doesn't feel like book one of a set.

312
00:22:07,436 --> 00:22:19,427
Speaker 1: it feels like the first chunk of a one complete book got ripped out but at least it ended on a Huge revelation and a coming together of all the ideas it did and it ended on a good beat of.

313
00:22:19,447 --> 00:22:20,430
Speaker 1: have you ever heard of?

314
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:21,346
Speaker 1: something called the moon?

315
00:22:22,112 --> 00:22:30,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, but meanwhile other books that had like Wheel of Time books just kind of stop and then the next book just starts like but They're so enormous.

316
00:22:30,536 --> 00:22:33,830
Speaker 0: They're tired at the end and that's why it feels like a complete thing.

317
00:22:34,171 --> 00:22:37,421
Speaker 1: They also all the later Wheel of Time books do not feel like a complete thing.

318
00:22:37,641 --> 00:22:45,333
Speaker 1: Okay, the ones I literally like book eight Or something like I hit the end and I hit next and I was like, oh shit It's done.

319
00:22:45,675 --> 00:22:48,050
Speaker 1: and I just opened book nine and just immediately hit next.

320
00:22:48,298 --> 00:22:57,670
Speaker 0: Okay Because the ones that I read all of them built up and eventually ended on a major Confrontation between the main character and the major evil, right?

321
00:22:57,930 --> 00:23:02,710
Speaker 1: And then you think that all of that gets resolved so much so early in those books, right?

322
00:23:02,770 --> 00:23:04,958
Speaker 0: But I'm saying is that all the books I read in that series.

323
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,809
Speaker 0: That's what happened like four or five something like that.

324
00:23:08,010 --> 00:23:12,396
Speaker 0: But like the end of the book was always a confrontation with major evil Right.

325
00:23:12,416 --> 00:23:15,710
Speaker 0: and the same way that like Star Wars Episode four ends with a fight with Darth Vader.

326
00:23:15,771 --> 00:23:16,175
Speaker 0: It's our.

327
00:23:16,216 --> 00:23:20,754
Speaker 0: episode five ends with a fight with Star Wars episode six Darth Vader.

328
00:23:20,914 --> 00:23:33,590
Speaker 1: if this the thing is this I wonder what if the next book will continue telling all these three stories as they come Together further or will it now just pick up from this moment where alabaster asks her to continue the apocalypse?

329
00:23:33,831 --> 00:23:37,810
Speaker 0: I hope it does continue from that part because I don't think there's too much more from the past.

330
00:23:37,890 --> 00:23:43,214
Speaker 0: We need to learn about the minute, you know, say night or I guess that's a night But I can't pronounce.

331
00:23:43,234 --> 00:23:47,427
Speaker 1: she's not sure what name she wants to use because she it's interesting how.

332
00:23:47,447 --> 00:23:49,055
Speaker 0: that's why I just keep saying main character.

333
00:23:49,237 --> 00:24:03,390
Speaker 1: well because the Book is structured in such a way that you see these three different people and then it's revealed that they're the same person at different Stages in their lives which sort of lines up with the like child woman crone Thing that is done in literature.

334
00:24:04,118 --> 00:24:22,737
Speaker 1: but simultaneously She has this self-awareness of Not caring about the overarching plot and is very conflicted about who she really is Because the reality of these three different lives is a very important part of her character and spinning is The really crazy thing.

335
00:24:22,798 --> 00:24:34,808
Speaker 0: is that like, you know, she's obviously because you're reading a book, you know This in the meta that she's like a central character in like this the whole world Picture but she as a character is only focused on going to get her child.

336
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:39,590
Speaker 0: Yep That's all she cares about at least in that one present timeline.

337
00:24:39,891 --> 00:24:45,817
Speaker 1: Everyone around her present especially the stone eaters are like you were the chosen one and she's like I don't give a shit Yeah, she doesn't care like that.

338
00:24:45,877 --> 00:24:46,681
Speaker 0: It's like stone is like.

339
00:24:46,702 --> 00:24:48,290
Speaker 0: this is the great mystery of the stone eaters.

340
00:24:48,330 --> 00:24:48,955
Speaker 0: Don't give a shit.

341
00:24:48,975 --> 00:24:53,930
Speaker 1: gonna get my child like when a stone eater shows up I'm like, oh my god my kid go like she finds anything interesting.

342
00:24:53,970 --> 00:24:57,342
Speaker 1: I'm like, let's find out push that lever do a thing follow up.

343
00:24:57,382 --> 00:24:59,710
Speaker 0: and she literally she's like, oh, I just want to find my baby.

344
00:25:00,071 --> 00:25:04,787
Speaker 1: She cares about the opposite of what I care about, which is interesting cuz she didn't care about her first baby.

345
00:25:05,409 --> 00:25:07,254
Speaker 1: Well She did.

346
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:09,849
Speaker 0: sort of not as much she cares about the one now.

347
00:25:10,291 --> 00:25:12,198
Speaker 1: Well, because there's nothing to do for the first baby.

348
00:25:12,579 --> 00:25:12,880
Speaker 0: Sure.

349
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:17,978
Speaker 1: I mean she did everything she could for that first baby kinda From her perspective.

350
00:25:18,038 --> 00:25:19,850
Speaker 1: That was the best thing for that baby.

351
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:29,970
Speaker 1: hmm, hmm because she lived through the fulcrum training and she lived through her life at that point later and She definitely made her decision that death is preferable to slavery.

352
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,585
Speaker 0: Hmm, and I thought especially after seeing the the the nodes or whatever.

353
00:25:34,765 --> 00:25:40,570
Speaker 1: Yeah the nodes of the problem I that that's a great moment before you know what the nodes are where she's like blah blah blah.

354
00:25:40,590 --> 00:25:41,709
Speaker 1: I don't want to get stuck in some back.

355
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:47,633
Speaker 0: That's another situation where like they talk about nodes and then like the chapter or two later you go in the node and get the Whole deal.

356
00:25:47,694 --> 00:25:52,810
Speaker 0: you don't have to like wait for the mystery of the node But the way we are still waiting for the mystery of the socket.

357
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:59,430
Speaker 1: So there's that moment where she says like like she's sympathetic to what she believes the person in the node is doing.

358
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:00,875
Speaker 1: She's like, yeah, I guess we should help them out.

359
00:26:01,337 --> 00:26:02,562
Speaker 1: and then alabaster pauses.

360
00:26:02,602 --> 00:26:05,433
Speaker 1: He's like you've never been to a node Have you?

361
00:26:05,573 --> 00:26:08,668
Speaker 1: nope, you've never been to the West Indies.

362
00:26:08,869 --> 00:26:13,774
Speaker 1: Nope so shall we go and How?

363
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:15,769
Speaker 1: he doesn't really need to explain it.

364
00:26:16,251 --> 00:26:30,127
Speaker 1: You just get this very like the slow reveal like obviously they go in they see what happened They leave but the way that chapter is written is almost like someone coming into a room and just looking bit by bit at all the things at the room.

365
00:26:30,147 --> 00:26:39,862
Speaker 1: and then Environmental storytelling does its thing and the full gnosis is revealed Just by seeing the remnants of an event that happened.

366
00:26:39,882 --> 00:26:42,590
Speaker 1: That was a very well-written scene.

367
00:26:42,731 --> 00:26:45,008
Speaker 0: I was the alabaster right is like.

368
00:26:45,839 --> 00:26:48,178
Speaker 0: He's way cool And it's sort of like it just.

369
00:26:48,318 --> 00:26:54,768
Speaker 0: it's just fun to have that kind of character around who's Ridiculous insane powerful like having a level 20 wizard in the party.

370
00:26:54,788 --> 00:27:00,434
Speaker 0: Yep It's sort of fun and just sort of that raw nerdy kind of way like oh my god This guy's so strong.

371
00:27:00,495 --> 00:27:02,423
Speaker 1: It also makes you feel like together.

372
00:27:02,463 --> 00:27:10,550
Speaker 0: They're invincible, but They hold it in check and don't just ruin everything because you got this guardian situation going on, right?

373
00:27:10,811 --> 00:27:14,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, he can't just go and do whatever he's got to actually sort of do his job.

374
00:27:14,772 --> 00:27:17,470
Speaker 0: But because he is so powerful can sort of get away with a lot.

375
00:27:17,650 --> 00:27:18,032
Speaker 1: But that's it.

376
00:27:18,092 --> 00:27:27,003
Speaker 1: The power of the origins is revealed to be ridiculously ridiculous Right away and the more you learn about it the more ridiculous it seems.

377
00:27:27,504 --> 00:27:31,269
Speaker 1: and you start to wonder more and more like wow Why does alabaster put up with any of it?

378
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:35,850
Speaker 0: Why did the x-men put up with this stupid US government always trying to make sentinel program?

379
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:42,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but then bit by bit like every new thing you learn about the Guardians makes you realize why?

380
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:45,403
Speaker 1: They're in power despite the origins.

381
00:27:45,503 --> 00:27:46,449
Speaker 1: all being gods.

382
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:53,530
Speaker 0: The Guardians got some sort of cyber implant of awesomeness.

383
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,622
Speaker 0: But also it freaks out and is being controlled by some sort of central AI.

384
00:27:57,662 --> 00:27:58,223
Speaker 0: who knows what?

385
00:27:58,925 --> 00:28:08,229
Speaker 1: I do also appreciate how the storytelling the narrator uses the second person a lot and Who the narrator is sort of gets revealed later?

386
00:28:09,113 --> 00:28:15,437
Speaker 1: And I thought that was really interesting because the the writing style is very Conversational and very.

387
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:18,590
Speaker 1: it definitely has its own beats that I've rarely encountered.

388
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:24,950
Speaker 0: It didn't fully pull out to a princess bride level to where you see who the narrator is talking to or anything like that.

389
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:25,775
Speaker 0: It gets close.

390
00:28:26,057 --> 00:28:32,784
Speaker 0: It gets close because the narrative will be like It'd be like Princess Bride if you saw a grandpa, but you didn't see what's-his-face.

391
00:28:33,025 --> 00:28:33,266
Speaker 0: Yeah.

392
00:28:33,306 --> 00:28:40,569
Speaker 1: Yeah So Yeah, I have other thoughts that I kind of want to just reserve until I see how this all.

393
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:48,869
Speaker 1: There are threads that I don't know if they will be meaningful or not And there's allegory that I don't know if I'm reading too much into it or not.

394
00:28:49,393 --> 00:28:51,309
Speaker 1: But I'm hyper focused on this.

395
00:28:51,872 --> 00:29:05,098
Speaker 1: What is not described because that is a very powerful story tell storytelling mechanic to tell someone Hey the things that aren't said are the important parts and then to tell a story and not say things Which this book is doing very much.

396
00:29:05,219 --> 00:29:14,090
Speaker 0: so I mean, I'm focused mostly on of course, you know the x-men Persecution story because that seems to be like the central obvious one.

397
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:18,954
Speaker 0: It's pushed really hard and then obviously I'm focused on Secondarily.

398
00:29:19,376 --> 00:29:32,304
Speaker 0: the tower was eager to space because I'm Scott Reuben and I like to tell in this case the terrible secret of the moon the socket the other side of the world the Obelisks the stone eaters what their deal is anything like that.

399
00:29:32,324 --> 00:29:33,608
Speaker 0: I got to know the deal.

400
00:29:33,889 --> 00:29:47,729
Speaker 1: Yep I'm just mostly invested in the the fallacy that dead civs are dead for a reason and the idea that not everyone has control over the Extrinsic disasters that might befall them.

401
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:53,529
Speaker 1: Yeah Like there are things that can happen to you like if a cosmic ray Came in and killed me somehow in this room.

402
00:29:53,991 --> 00:30:04,810
Speaker 1: There is literally nothing I could have done to prevent that and thus there is no value judgment To be made based on that fate to any decision I have ever made in my life.

403
00:30:04,953 --> 00:30:05,168
Speaker 0: All right.

404
00:30:05,190 --> 00:30:07,489
Speaker 0: So I just want to guess what the terrible secret to space is.

405
00:30:08,052 --> 00:30:27,393
Speaker 0: My guess is that on the other side of the world like the moon just fucking crashed into the earth because some orogene badness Probably and that's why this seasons all the time because the earth is all fucked up because there's a moon smashed into it And the socket is probably from like a piece of moon that landed there and the moon is what you know gave people Powers and

406
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:30,123
Speaker 1: I think the socket is what was used to strip.

407
00:30:30,183 --> 00:30:35,460
Speaker 1: I think it legit that manufactured Obelisks and the obelisks are something very specific.

408
00:30:35,961 --> 00:30:36,623
Speaker 0: Oh, that's good.

409
00:30:36,643 --> 00:30:37,265
Speaker 0: That's good.

410
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:38,849
Speaker 1: That's what I think something like that.

411
00:30:39,130 --> 00:30:41,710
Speaker 0: But yeah, the stone eaters in the obelisk like flying it around.

412
00:30:42,311 --> 00:30:46,370
Speaker 1: I don't know if the stone eater was trapped in the obelisk or if he was using the obelisk.

413
00:30:46,592 --> 00:30:48,750
Speaker 1: Maybe people play and play God.

414
00:30:50,571 --> 00:30:51,976
Speaker 0: Really good part of the book.

415
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:54,744
Speaker 0: It's like one of those short in-between the chapter things.

416
00:30:55,126 --> 00:30:57,413
Speaker 0: That's sort of like an aside Yeah, and it's like.

417
00:30:57,794 --> 00:31:02,611
Speaker 0: it's like well, it's a good you know, it's like oh, yeah this world this and that and people are like This.

418
00:31:02,672 --> 00:31:05,949
Speaker 0: well, it's a good thing that people aren't the only intelligent life on this world.

419
00:31:07,015 --> 00:31:09,793
Speaker 0: And I was like, oh, that's so good It's okay.

420
00:31:10,395 --> 00:31:17,850
Speaker 1: I do wonder if evil earth will actually be a Person like a thing of some kind other than just literally a planet.

421
00:31:19,070 --> 00:31:30,046
Speaker 1: it's the moon, I don't know cuz the implant that the Guardians get Appears to be able to fail in a weird way because that Guardian went crazy, right?

422
00:31:30,067 --> 00:31:31,009
Speaker 0: I think that it like it.

423
00:31:31,934 --> 00:31:34,309
Speaker 1: The implant you tapped into something that's there.

424
00:31:34,510 --> 00:31:45,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, almost like cuz in creating some sort of connection with something and like the radio signal in wool Which I think I can say cuz this Soul or demon or something in there?

425
00:31:45,657 --> 00:31:57,370
Speaker 1: Yeah something along those lines like it's almost like maybe there's a radio transmitter somewhere That's transmitting crazy bullshit and the Guardians plug that into their brain and they're barely holding out of their sanity using it.

426
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,437
Speaker 0: I don't know something some nonsense like that.

427
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:02,187
Speaker 1: Anyway, also I want to see what Tonkis deal is like.

428

00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:11,358
Speaker 0: I didn't see that coming.

433
00:32:11,378 --> 00:32:12,890
Speaker 1: I did not see that coming at all.

434
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:15,761
Speaker 0: Well, you actually had asked you would you discuss something about it?

435
00:32:15,801 --> 00:32:18,655
Speaker 0: and I was like, oh because I had already read it I got up.

436
00:32:18,796 --> 00:32:25,488
Speaker 0: I was right before the point where Yeah, and you started talking to me about it and I'm like, well you don't know the deal do you?

437
00:32:25,528 --> 00:32:27,830
Speaker 0: and you're like, oh And I'm like, oh I was like Tonki seems cool.

438
00:32:27,910 --> 00:32:28,874
Speaker 1: I wonder what her deal.

439
00:32:28,954 --> 00:32:32,328
Speaker 0: she seems a lot like an anime character to me one of those characters.

440
00:32:32,368 --> 00:32:36,270
Speaker 0: Yeah Who's you know, like ooh, I got to learn all the stuff.

441
00:32:36,411 --> 00:32:46,770
Speaker 0: I'm the science girl with a whole bunch of papers trying to learn everything And then the fact that that character was actually came back in the other timeline and bumped into the main character again is like whoa.

442
00:32:47,770 --> 00:32:53,276
Speaker 1: And also I like how she's that kind of tinker character who will Obviously is hiding a lot.

443
00:32:53,557 --> 00:32:56,809
Speaker 0: She's like guns from Chrono Trigger the girl you meet with the.

444
00:32:58,013 --> 00:32:59,658
Speaker 0: You know the mechanical girl Luca.

445
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:00,039

446
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,283
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like Luca.

00:33:01,303 --> 00:33:01,845
Speaker 1: I could see that.

448
00:33:01,885 --> 00:33:03,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's that kind of character.

449
00:33:03,933 --> 00:33:12,533
Speaker 1: Anyway, so yeah well I'm gonna read at least the second book and If the second book would have to somehow be really bad for me to not read the third How could it be?

450
00:33:12,613 --> 00:33:13,296
Speaker 0: I can meet people.

451
00:33:13,357 --> 00:33:15,990
Speaker 0: some people said it's not good, but I can't imagine it being well.

452
00:33:16,211 --> 00:33:19,205
Speaker 1: So the people I've who seem to have said that didn't really say it's not good.

453
00:33:19,225 --> 00:33:23,758
Speaker 1: They said it's not Great, like it's not as good.

454
00:33:23,779 --> 00:33:24,721
Speaker 0: Well, we'll see.

455
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:30,518
Speaker 1: but at the same time like I've read a lot of if I eat a Perfect steak and then I eat a steak.

456
00:33:30,538 --> 00:33:32,325
Speaker 1: That's only 80% as good as that steak.

457
00:33:32,365 --> 00:33:36,196
Speaker 0: That's still a good steak Yeah, but yeah I think this shows the the.

458
00:33:36,317 --> 00:33:38,486
Speaker 0: all the hype that I heard for many moons.

00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:41,663

Speaker 1: So You see many moons.

461
00:33:43,714 --> 00:33:46,363

00:33:46,403 --> 00:33:51,014

463
00:33:51,394 --> 00:33:52,656
