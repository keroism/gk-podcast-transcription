00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,725
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday December 17th.

2
00:00:12,086 --> 00:00:12,527
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,628 --> 00:00:14,953
Speaker 1: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

00:00:14,993 --> 00:00:16,155
Speaker 1: We talk about Mamoru.

5
00:00:16,196 --> 00:00:17,840
Speaker 1: She's the sky crawlers.

6
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,923
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,943 --> 00:00:34,039
Speaker 1: I have bruises in places that I wish I didn't have bruises.

8
00:00:34,059 --> 00:00:36,833
Speaker 0: actually I have a bruise on my leg like last night.

9
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:46,532
Speaker 0: I was laying in bed and Sort of randomly my like calf just like cramped like and it stayed Crammed and like I like.

10
00:00:46,653 --> 00:00:53,540
Speaker 0: it was so cramped I put my hand near it to like feel and like the shape of my leg had changed and would not change back.

11
00:00:54,641 --> 00:00:57,610
Speaker 0: And today it's like whenever I flex that muscle over there.

12
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,880
Speaker 0: There's like obviously some sort of bruising internally.

13
00:01:01,242 --> 00:01:02,929
Speaker 1: So actually that's very common.

14
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:05,480
Speaker 1: It's caused by a sedentary lifestyle.

15
00:01:08,161 --> 00:01:08,884
Speaker 1: No, I don't know.

16
00:01:08,924 --> 00:01:11,192

Speaker 0: I don't know I don't know what I got.

37
00:02:01,768 --> 00:02:04,969
Speaker 1: I Went skiing.

38
00:02:05,353 --> 00:02:08,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I learned something.

39
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:09,199
Speaker 1: I learned something really important.

40
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:19,999
Speaker 1: I learned that if if the website for a ski resort says frozen granular surface conditions That's a code actually and the code means rims gonna bust his ass.

41
00:02:20,803 --> 00:02:24,077
Speaker 0: Well, if it's frozen, that means it's gonna be hard which means you can fall down.

42
00:02:24,097 --> 00:02:24,840
Speaker 0: You're gonna hurt yourself.

43
00:02:24,981 --> 00:02:27,895
Speaker 1: Well, basically frozen granular consists of ice.

44
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:32,409
Speaker 1: Well snow that became ice that has now broken up.

45
00:02:32,429 --> 00:02:36,659
Speaker 1: So you're skiing on like chunky hard pieces of broken snow.

46
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:50,265
Speaker 0: It's awesome Mmm, so it's sort of like, you know when the snow freezes and you know You step on it and you sort of make like these holes in it and then but just people just step on all the snow And then it gets all crunched up.

47
00:02:50,325 --> 00:03:03,400
Speaker 1: It's kind of like skiing on pebbles like a sea of pebbles but pebbles made of ice Mmm, yeah, so I would try to do things that I was able to do proficiently last year and not succeed in my endeavors.

48
00:03:04,301 --> 00:03:10,859
Speaker 0: Damn those weather Required Sporting events.

49
00:03:12,242 --> 00:03:18,180
Speaker 0: I mean like, you know, I mean ice hockey sort of needs some weather unless you have an indoor ice hockey.

50
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:22,117
Speaker 0: But even then it's like as long as it's less than 32 degrees and you got a Zamboni.

51
00:03:22,137 --> 00:03:26,797
Speaker 1: It's all good Yeah, but snow like it depends on the previous several days weather.

52
00:03:26,817 --> 00:03:30,736
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, so I'm in a little bit of pain.

53
00:03:30,756 --> 00:03:37,065
Speaker 1: yesterday All right I skipped work.

54
00:03:37,126 --> 00:03:38,915
Speaker 1: I went skiing and that's it.

55
00:03:39,257 --> 00:03:43,660
Speaker 0: All right now I only have to work this week and I guess this is the last episode I have to do this week.

56
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:44,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, next week.

57
00:03:45,326 --> 00:03:48,880
Speaker 1: No more work until next year up until Christmas Eve.

58
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,600
Speaker 1: And then I'm not going back to work till the second.

59
00:03:51,964 --> 00:03:53,200
Speaker 0: I'm not going back to work until the fifth.

60
00:03:53,341 --> 00:03:55,180
Speaker 1: I'm going for a half day on the second.

61
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:59,560
Speaker 1: I'm gonna pop in on the second and do work but to train rises a lot of time.

62
00:03:59,921 --> 00:04:03,115
Speaker 1: No, because you realize the whole crew is gonna go to the city and do stuff that day.

63
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:04,140
Speaker 0: Is that what you want to do?

64
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,267
Speaker 1: Well, that's what they all want to do.

65
00:04:05,529 --> 00:04:06,475
Speaker 0: We'll see what happens.

66
00:04:06,616 --> 00:04:07,300
Speaker 1: That's what's gonna happen.

67
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,347
Speaker 1: then I rented.

68
00:04:08,367 --> 00:04:15,060
Speaker 1: I didn't rent it yet, but I'm gonna rent a One of the giant rooms in one of the good karaoke places and we're all gonna go do karaoke.

69
00:04:15,322 --> 00:04:17,680
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna do karaoke so you can stay home with it.

70
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,051
Speaker 1: All the other lame people and the rest of us will go to karaoke.

71
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:22,060
Speaker 0: You can do all the karaoke you want.

72
00:04:22,564 --> 00:04:23,188
Speaker 1: Oh, we will.

73
00:04:23,874 --> 00:04:24,639
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, we will.

74
00:04:25,341 --> 00:04:40,731
Speaker 1: This time I'm not wasting my money and time on such a thing have to print out Romanized lyrics to Japanese songs because My knowledge of katakana does not even consist of all of katakana or hiragana Let alone kanji, so I can't sing along to Japanese.

75
00:04:40,912 --> 00:04:43,100
Speaker 0: I know like three letters of one of the honors.

76
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:47,412
Speaker 1: I can sing a couple of songs like the KO century beast opener.

77
00:04:47,492 --> 00:04:48,234
Speaker 1: I know it by now.

78
00:04:48,455 --> 00:04:50,420
Speaker 1: It's in English rock and roll bomber.

79
00:04:50,661 --> 00:04:53,188
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it's not all in missus in English.

80
00:04:53,328 --> 00:04:54,572
Speaker 0: It's it's enough in English.

81
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:55,475
Speaker 1: Oh, you know me.

82
00:04:55,515 --> 00:04:57,260
Speaker 1: Sorry, ooh, three two ones.

83
00:04:57,481 --> 00:05:01,214
Speaker 0: Yeah, the only word in there is The only Japanese.

84
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:07,137
Speaker 1: No, it's a really easy word rock and roll bomber plus half the songs in Japanese.

85
00:05:07,157 --> 00:05:07,799
Speaker 1: What's wrong with you?

86
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:15,220
Speaker 1: Anyway only the rock and roll bomber part is in English, which is the majority of the song.

87
00:05:16,223 --> 00:05:18,730
Speaker 0: And like you said koi no misayalu.

88
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:21,539
Speaker 0: It's that's no missile is English.

89
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:23,364
Speaker 1: It's a missile of love.

90
00:05:23,645 --> 00:05:24,066
Speaker 0: Yeah.

91
00:05:24,387 --> 00:05:24,608
Speaker 0: Yeah.

92
00:05:24,648 --> 00:05:30,347
Speaker 0: Yeah Not so many.

93
00:05:30,407 --> 00:05:32,758
Speaker 0: and also there are many characters in the show who speak the English.

94
00:05:32,779 --> 00:05:37,938
Speaker 0: Oh Bud mint, I love you all the bird people.

95
00:05:40,804 --> 00:05:43,379
Speaker 1: So you got to the part with that Colonel Sanders, I'd forgotten about him.

96
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,229
Speaker 1: We're not reviewing KO century beast yet.

97
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:54,055
Speaker 0: No, we're not soon.

98
00:05:54,457 --> 00:05:58,299
Speaker 0: I watched I think Four episodes now, there's only three left.

99
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:04,260
Speaker 1: That's a show that really I see it from this whole different perspective now than what I did when I first watched it.

100
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,402
Speaker 1: Of course, I think part of it's that when I first watched it, it was like 3 a.m Yeah Definitely.

101
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:09,924
Speaker 0: I don't know.

102
00:06:10,506 --> 00:06:12,413
Speaker 0: I've seen the show mostly the same as before.

103
00:06:12,453 --> 00:06:14,340
Speaker 0: It's actually more of a robot show than I remember.

104
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:19,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, well I get more of it now like I get things they're referencing that I had no idea.

105
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,888
Speaker 0: But I don't see that many references.

106
00:06:20,928 --> 00:06:23,117
Speaker 0: We it seems mostly I don't know.

107
00:06:23,238 --> 00:06:23,700
Speaker 1: There's a few.

108
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,060
Speaker 1: There's a few that really stand out that I wouldn't have noticed like the whole thing with mahjong.

109
00:06:27,502 --> 00:06:28,225
Speaker 1: Yeah, the mahjong.

110
00:06:28,286 --> 00:06:30,174
Speaker 1: I didn't know about mahjong anime back then.

111
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:32,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was pretty good All right.

112
00:06:32,685 --> 00:06:34,053
Speaker 0: Anyway, definitely one of the better scenes.

113
00:06:34,114 --> 00:06:36,846
Speaker 0: All right, it's a Manga comics night.

114
00:06:36,906 --> 00:06:44,510
Speaker 1: So is there any anime manga comics news other than the fact that Continuously the anime industry in America is in its death spot.

115
00:06:44,550 --> 00:06:45,412
Speaker 0: It's not news.

116
00:06:45,974 --> 00:06:46,475
Speaker 0: It's not news.

117
00:06:46,756 --> 00:06:47,578
Speaker 0: What's there to say?

118
00:06:47,638 --> 00:06:52,812
Speaker 0: Um, Usually the news I hate the most Right is all that.

Speaker 0: Yes, right.

124
00:07:01,884 --> 00:07:04,320

125
00:07:04,662 --> 00:07:08,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, like a hundred years from now, you know, cuz I mean there have been in the past.

126

Speaker 0: There have been movies that were made like fully made the movie is done Edited the whole thing that never saw the light of day there multiple times.

127
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:21,693
Speaker 0: This has happened So I usually don't trust any movie news at all.

128
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:23,380
Speaker 1: Oh, there's a minor update.

129
00:07:24,541 --> 00:07:33,580
Speaker 1: Peter Jackson said of Temeraire and I quote Blah blah blah, I particularly love fantasy and historical epic.

130
00:07:34,203 --> 00:07:38,060
Speaker 1: I can't wait to see Napoleonic battles fought with the squadron of dragons.

131
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:41,667
Speaker 1: That is someone said is what I go to the movies for.

133
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:47,581
Speaker 1: I want to make that movie.

134
00:07:47,642 --> 00:07:48,144
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

135
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:58,229
Speaker 1: any option the rights, but yeah, but option meaning not set in stone what needs to be pointed out that that is a sentiment that Scott Johnson can also be behind.

136
00:07:58,249 --> 00:08:00,829
Speaker 1: that Is what he goes to the movies for it is indeed.

137
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:03,257
Speaker 0: But anyway, I'm not talking about that movie.

138
00:08:03,277 --> 00:08:04,300
Speaker 0: who gives a shit about that.

139
00:08:05,183 --> 00:08:19,989
Speaker 0: I'm talking about this movie news, which Even though this is a movie that is gonna come out and when 2010 right It's set in stone enough it where I couldn't I would bet money that you know.

140
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:22,460
Speaker 0: Everything that is here is going to come to be.

141
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,183
Speaker 0: you know, it is.

142
00:08:23,485 --> 00:08:24,469
Speaker 0: it is a certain thing.

143
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:32,246
Speaker 0: basically You know, I'm not really excited about any movies that come out these days really at all.

144
00:08:32,448 --> 00:08:37,163
Speaker 0: so much except I think this might be like the first one.

145
00:08:37,203 --> 00:08:44,546
Speaker 0: and the worst part about it is as Really don't like a lot of underwear pervert movies, especially the recent ones.

146
00:08:44,787 --> 00:08:50,123
Speaker 1: Well, I gotta say The recent Batman movies did not do it for no, everyone likes those.

147
00:08:50,204 --> 00:08:50,745
Speaker 0: I don't like those.

148
00:08:50,805 --> 00:08:51,387
Speaker 0: I like the 1989 Batman.

149
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:55,404
Speaker 0: I like I guess I like that first spider-man one.

150
00:08:55,424 --> 00:08:56,550
Speaker 0: I didn't see the other ones.

151
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:58,658
Speaker 0: I guess I didn't like any of the x-men move.

152
00:08:58,719 --> 00:09:00,888
Speaker 1: my problem with the Batman movies in particular.

153
00:09:00,908 --> 00:09:04,237
Speaker 1: Is that Everyone in them is awesome except Batman.

154
00:09:04,799 --> 00:09:11,416
Speaker 1: I mean Batman is such a static character in these and so just like I'm Batman.

155
00:09:11,937 --> 00:09:13,322
Speaker 1: I mean look at the Dark Knight Returns.

156
00:09:13,382 --> 00:09:14,144
Speaker 1: The reason it's good.

157
00:09:14,184 --> 00:09:15,970
Speaker 1: Is that Batman changes?

158
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,492
Speaker 1: Everything changes.

159
00:09:17,532 --> 00:09:18,996
Speaker 1: people die people change.

160
00:09:19,678 --> 00:09:22,707
Speaker 1: the Joker was a. someone else actually pointed this out to me.

161
00:09:22,727 --> 00:09:25,553
Speaker 1: I didn't notice it, but the Joker Doesn't change.

162
00:09:25,954 --> 00:09:26,556
Speaker 1: Batman does.

163
00:09:26,616 --> 00:09:28,462
Speaker 1: no one changes in the new movies at all.

164
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:30,849
Speaker 1: And also microwaves don't work that way.

165
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:32,819
Speaker 0: Yeah, that really bothered me.

166
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,970
Speaker 1: that bothered me enough that I stopped watching it.

167
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:37,342
Speaker 0: No, but you know in 2008, right?

168
00:09:37,382 --> 00:09:38,930
Speaker 0: We saw the Iron Man movie.

169
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:39,834
Speaker 0: I didn't see it.

174
00:09:48,735 --> 00:09:53,530

175
00:09:54,411 --> 00:10:06,763
Speaker 0: It's the Avengers and the Avengers, you know has many characters in it that change over time but the three characters that are the Avengers and Marvel are Iron Man cats in America and Thor now.

176
00:10:06,924 --> 00:10:08,510

Speaker 1: I've suddenly decided I want a movie that is just the Norse gods doing their thing.

181
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,521
Speaker 0: Well, if you ever read actual, you know Thor comics like from Marvel.

182
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:26,835
Speaker 0: a lot of them are just that it's mostly like when you see Thor and Avengers is me.

183
00:10:26,856 --> 00:10:28,141

Speaker 0: Have you heard like this?

187
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,403
Speaker 0: I think I've talked about this once before.

00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:37,009
Speaker 0: you don't remember?

189
00:10:37,991 --> 00:10:42,209
Speaker 0: No, oh well then basically the.

190
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:51,289
Speaker 0: Let me read to you the quotes from from the The director before I tell you who this director is.

191
00:10:52,350 --> 00:10:57,385
Speaker 0: Alright, I'm directing Thor or the mighty Thor as you might like to call it.

192
00:10:58,006 --> 00:10:59,049
Speaker 0: I think it will be Thor.

193
00:11:00,572 --> 00:11:01,897
Speaker 0: There has been lots of talk.

194
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:04,307
Speaker 0: I sound like a politician, but we were too early.

195
00:11:04,347 --> 00:11:08,550
Speaker 0: at this stage We're getting the story and the visual effects together and all that is very exciting.

196
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:12,445
Speaker 0: Someone sensational is going to play the part, but it is early days.

197
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:20,277
Speaker 0: It's Akashi Mika Something about it's.

198
00:11:20,357 --> 00:11:21,987
Speaker 0: they're gonna concentrate a lot on.

199
00:11:22,007 --> 00:11:23,192
Speaker 0: you know the the.

200
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:32,706
Speaker 0: you know cuz Thor in Marvel Comics is like a normal dude and he gets the hammer and then he turns into Thor and They turns the normal dude and they're gonna you know concentrate on some of the human story there.

201
00:11:32,787 --> 00:11:38,749
Speaker 0: and then in 2011 the year after the Thor movie there's gonna be Avengers movie, which is Iron Man Captain America Thor, right?

202
00:11:40,531 --> 00:11:44,401
Speaker 0: No, but you know, this is rumor ish before but now it's it's.

203
00:11:44,742 --> 00:11:47,610
Speaker 0: it's gonna be as long as Marvel doesn't fold or anything.

204
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:50,359
Speaker 0: by 2011 all these four movies will exist.

205
00:11:50,821 --> 00:11:53,389
Speaker 0: No, but the director of Thor is Kenneth Branagh.

206
00:11:55,450 --> 00:12:07,119
Speaker 1: What I told you I Almost had a nerd gasping right there That the only thing that can make that better is if somehow Patrick Stewart had a role in it.

207
00:12:09,621 --> 00:12:15,180
Speaker 0: Kenneth Brad he has broken his silence about directing a film version cuz he had see it broke the silence.

208
00:12:15,902 --> 00:12:16,565
Speaker 0: So it was like.

209
00:12:16,825 --> 00:12:19,535
Speaker 0: it was like whisper whisper, but now it's like alright.

210
00:12:19,555 --> 00:12:21,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I am directing Thor.

211
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:24,150
Speaker 0: I think the mighty Thor as you might like to probably did tell.

212
00:12:24,211 --> 00:12:27,584
Speaker 1: tell me this but I probably just assumed it wasn't true and Thus forgot it.

213
00:12:28,389 --> 00:12:30,040
Speaker 0: Well now it is the true true.

214
00:12:30,921 --> 00:12:36,160
Speaker 0: You know, it is Wednesday and it's like normally, you know when you have a new movie news that's so far out you go.

215
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:49,849
Speaker 0: Hey, right, but know that the superhero movies if are pretty much set in stone, you know They're gonna keep making these things is they keep breaking in the money and these are the ones they're gonna do and that's that I should say because it is a Wednesday night.

216
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:53,460
Speaker 1: Oh, well, it's Tuesday technically since Scott broke the illusion.

Speaker 1: it is a masterpiece Mm-hmm.

221
00:13:16,222 --> 00:13:20,273
Speaker 1: I say second best because a Patrick Stewart's Hamlet is apparently also awesome.

222
00:13:20,935 --> 00:13:22,720

228
00:13:50,221 --> 00:13:50,924
Speaker 0: Nothing, I guess.

229
00:13:51,025 --> 00:13:51,808
Speaker 0: I don't know, huh?

230
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,340

00:13:54,761 --> 00:13:56,026
Speaker 0: I'm only excited about the store.

232
00:13:56,086 --> 00:13:57,190
Speaker 0: Fuck all the others.

233
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,716

00:13:58,756 --> 00:13:59,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, fuck all these other movies.

235
00:14:02,281 --> 00:14:05,818
Speaker 1: So speaking of things that may or may not be made only pretty much.

236
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:09,675
Speaker 1: Ever since asa manga daioh was a huge success.

237
00:14:09,755 --> 00:14:15,359
Speaker 1: the manga and the anime Yotsuba has been like the one of the best manga out there.

238
00:14:15,640 --> 00:14:20,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was also one of the biggest selling manga outside of the Naruto's and things and it's fantastic.

239
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,149
Speaker 1: I don't need to tell you it's fantastic.

240
00:14:22,170 --> 00:14:31,109
Speaker 1: I don't need to tell you you should be reading it but What everyone's been saying every anime fan pretty much since they first saw Yotsuba was When's it gonna be an anime?

241
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,035
Speaker 1: When's it gonna be an anime?

242
00:14:32,055 --> 00:14:32,800
Speaker 1: When's it gonna be an anime?

243
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,991
Speaker 1: And there's always rumors about oh, well, there's gonna be an anime.

244
00:14:37,052 --> 00:14:37,814
Speaker 1: Oh, no, there isn't.

245
00:14:38,195 --> 00:14:42,135
Speaker 1: Oh there is and it's gonna be directed by Moroshi.

246
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:49,133
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Yes, it's going to be a Takashi Miike live-action Yotsuba.

247
00:14:49,474 --> 00:14:50,398
Speaker 1: That could be good.

248
00:14:50,418 --> 00:14:50,839
Speaker 1: You know what?

249
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:53,099
Speaker 1: With that little squirt gun.

250
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:58,626
Speaker 1: If only I could draw I would.

251
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,192
Speaker 1: this is a. this is homework listeners who can draw.

252
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:08,920
Speaker 1: draw me a bunch of four panels Like when Yotsuba had that squirt gun as if Yotsuba were directed by Takashi Miike.

253
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:16,548
Speaker 0: No Just go and take pages from Yotsuba put that page up and then right next to it draw the same page Directed by Takashi Miike.

254
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:18,420
Speaker 1: I want to make this a meme seriously?

255
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:21,789
Speaker 0: Well, no, let's do the Takashi Miike and anything meme.

256
00:15:21,829 --> 00:15:27,417
Speaker 0: just take anything and then remix it as by Takashi Miike Anything at all?

257
00:15:29,384 --> 00:15:34,200
Speaker 1: Hey, I smell a panel a panel that could only be enjoyed by people who know their anime.

258
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:46,246
Speaker 1: Anyway in the long string of stories as to why there will or will not or when or how be a Yotsuba anime You make one there will be.

259
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:55,186
Speaker 1: the latest news is actually kind of interesting because asthma came out and Made statements about all this.

260
00:15:55,246 --> 00:15:57,372
Speaker 1: finally and he didn't make the statement.

261
00:15:57,412 --> 00:15:58,074
Speaker 1: I expected it.

262
00:15:58,215 --> 00:16:00,923
Speaker 1: He didn't say something like yes There's an anime.

263
00:16:01,023 --> 00:16:02,127
Speaker 1: No, there's not.

264
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,414
Speaker 1: what he said was the

265
00:16:04,534 --> 00:16:05,096
Speaker 0: reasons

266
00:16:05,156 --> 00:16:27,760
Speaker 1: you all are saying For why there is not an anime are made up crap Mmm, and he said very simply I'm not gonna quote from the article or anything, but he basically Yotsuba just would not translate well to an anime to anything other than a comic and he can't come up with a way To make it an anime that would keep it funny for the reasons that it's funny.

267
00:16:28,604 --> 00:16:40,449
Speaker 0: On the one hand I can sort of see that but on the other hand You know, there have been lots of things that you know, we're sort of called untranslatable, but did really Came out just fine, but it's different.

268
00:16:40,489 --> 00:16:43,940
Speaker 1: when I was the author themselves say yeah, not gonna happen.

269
00:16:44,464 --> 00:16:48,509
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it might not get it might not be able to happen But just because he can't see a way to do it.

270
00:16:48,972 --> 00:16:50,720
Speaker 0: I think there are people who can make it happen.

271
00:16:50,962 --> 00:17:02,739
Speaker 1: I mean I can imagine it myself, you know Like one example he pointed out was like there's one where Yotsuba walks in and goes hello And everyone ignores her and all the rest of the panels are just no one reacting and then it ends.

272
00:17:03,661 --> 00:17:08,300
Speaker 1: And he was like all right like okay I could do that but it wouldn't be as funny if it was animated.

273
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:13,900
Speaker 0: I know you just put like some cricket noises over it, you know, yeah, I don't know that that's just what I was gonna say.

274
00:17:14,060 --> 00:17:16,480
Speaker 1: I can't yeah, I can't impinge upon him.

275
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:22,460
Speaker 0: No, the one thing about Yotsuba is that unlike every other popular manga that came out in the u.s.

276
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:24,951
Speaker 0: This was actually published by ADV manga.

277
00:17:24,971 --> 00:17:26,678
Speaker 0: It was like the only thing they ever published.

278
00:17:26,718 --> 00:17:30,276
Speaker 0: besides well I think there was one of their manga they had that I liked but no one else liked.

279
00:17:30,778 --> 00:17:38,843
Speaker 0: but Yotsubana is a manga dire where they're only sort of successful manga ventures, you know, and then now ADV is DOA, right?

280
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:42,576
Speaker 0: Well, I guess not OA because they've arrived a long time ago, but they're.

281
00:17:42,696 --> 00:17:47,031
Speaker 1: they're D But they're not MD.

282
00:17:47,312 --> 00:17:53,439
Speaker 0: no, they're M.I.A and So Yotsuba is also M.I.A even though it was wickedly popular and made lots of money.

283
00:17:53,862 --> 00:17:55,895
Speaker 0: But ADV kind of owns it doesn't own it.

284
00:17:55,955 --> 00:17:56,599
Speaker 0: what's going on?

285
00:17:56,921 --> 00:18:02,669
Speaker 0: We're waiting for all these volumes a bunch of volumes out in Japan But they're not out in English only because ADV sucks.

286
00:18:02,970 --> 00:18:06,020
Speaker 0: if like visit license this we'd probably have every volume already.

287
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:09,240
Speaker 0: You know, if dark horse had licensed it we'd have every volume already.

288
00:18:09,561 --> 00:18:12,892
Speaker 0: It's only because ADV license it that were that everyone in the u.s.

289
00:18:12,932 --> 00:18:17,065
Speaker 0: Has to suffer even though this thing is very Popular and profitable.

290
00:18:17,165 --> 00:18:18,870
Speaker 0: So the other manga companies?

291
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:21,358
Speaker 0: somebody got to snatch this shit up and I can't.

292
00:18:21,378 --> 00:18:24,000
Speaker 0: I can't imagine that They don't realize that this is going on.

293
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:24,302
Speaker 0: It's just.

294
00:18:24,624 --> 00:18:27,320
Speaker 0: I imagine it's a difficult situation and someone's got a freaking.

295
00:18:27,924 --> 00:18:31,667
Speaker 0: No one has against the motivation to work it out Except for the fans.

296
00:18:31,707 --> 00:18:32,390
Speaker 1: What's interesting?

297
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:47,420
Speaker 1: Is that some of these rumors are crazy like some people were saying there's no anime because him and some director had a falling out or That he doesn't get along with Tomoko Kaneda who is the voice of Chiyo-chan, but did he know?

298
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,230
Speaker 0: No, how do you know these two?

299
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,239
Speaker 0: How do you come up with that?

300
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,283
Speaker 1: You know what?

301
00:18:51,303 --> 00:18:53,276
Speaker 1: It's real easy if I want to spread a rumor, right?

302
00:18:53,357 --> 00:19:00,247
Speaker 1: All right Shit up and I'll go to a forum somewhere and I'll just be like, yes, so I heard Mamoru.

303
00:19:00,610 --> 00:19:06,040
Speaker 1: Oh, she is working with Osamu Tezuka to make a live action.

304
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:10,066
Speaker 0: Tezuka's dead Evangelion spin-off call.

305
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:14,600
Speaker 0: I mean if someone goes in a forum and says that the next post is how could you possibly know that?

306
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,262
Speaker 0: No, it isn't.

307
00:19:15,302 --> 00:19:21,780
Speaker 1: the next post is OMG and then the next post is lololol buts It's the internet.

308
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:22,521
Speaker 1: What do you want?

309
00:19:28,946 --> 00:19:31,148
Speaker 1: So I guess it's time for things of the day.

310
00:19:31,248 --> 00:19:39,210
Speaker 1: I thought that I had seen every possible Funny thing on the internet involving a Leonidas face.

311
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:56,017
Speaker 1: You know what I'm talking about that very specific set of faces of King Leonidas that so Perfectly encapsulates everything that I think is funny on the internet much like that face the yellow face looking up like It wasn't there.

312
00:19:56,037 --> 00:19:57,449
Speaker 0: a really good Leonidas are really.

313
00:19:58,479 --> 00:20:01,010
Speaker 1: Yes There's a good Leonidas everything.

314
00:20:01,694 --> 00:20:04,050
Speaker 1: But I thought I'd seen them all like I really did.

315
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:04,996
Speaker 1: I thought that I had.

316
00:20:05,056 --> 00:20:12,001
Speaker 1: there was no one who was going to make one That was newest new enough or funny enough or different enough to make me go.

317
00:20:12,021 --> 00:20:12,883
Speaker 1: Oh, wow.

318
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:14,066
Speaker 1: I didn't expect that.

319
00:20:14,086 --> 00:20:16,497
Speaker 1: I Must have missed one.

320
00:20:17,163 --> 00:20:17,869
Speaker 1: So here we go.

321
00:20:19,091 --> 00:20:21,562
Speaker 1: What would you do with the drunken Spartan if you?

322
00:20:21,843 --> 00:20:23,390
Speaker 1: I don't know you might have all already seen this.

323
00:20:23,531 --> 00:20:31,548
Speaker 1: I don't know what you kids watch on the internet, but this was Unexpectedly funny and the fact that it's so long just makes it funnier.

324
00:20:32,293 --> 00:20:40,070
Speaker 1: I I don't know what I can say other than that There are about three or four points in this where the Leonidas face just does something.

325
00:20:40,291 --> 00:20:47,844
Speaker 1: Usually it's like there's one Leonidas face singing and there's another one like in frame not doing anything And then suddenly that one will do something and I'll lose it.

326
00:20:47,865 --> 00:20:50,179
Speaker 0: Yeah Is that it?

327
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:51,005
Speaker 1: that's it.

328
00:20:51,146 --> 00:20:51,948
Speaker 0: that's it All right.

329
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:52,936
Speaker 0: So I'm listening to me.

330
00:20:52,956 --> 00:21:01,490
Speaker 0: world orders right and in passing Daryl Surratt sort of mentioned some video game like an old video game that no one's ever heard of called metal wolf chaos.

331
00:21:01,831 --> 00:21:07,889
Speaker 0: Right metal wolf metal gear you basically just as metal of chaos something something everyone loves metal of chaos bla bla bla.

332
00:21:07,929 --> 00:21:10,497
Speaker 1: the end Right, that's a very Daryl Surratt statement.

333
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:13,867
Speaker 0: I go and I ask him yo, what's that wolf thing?

334
00:21:13,927 --> 00:21:14,990
Speaker 0: He's like what wolf thing?

335
00:21:15,030 --> 00:21:15,613
Speaker 0: I'm like you said.

336
00:21:15,673 --> 00:21:19,309
Speaker 0: there's some video games like oh, yeah metal wolf chaos cuz I didn't remember the name, right?

337
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:21,837
Speaker 0: So he's like, yeah was this game.

338
00:21:22,078 --> 00:21:25,250
Speaker 0: That was an Xbox one game not an Xbox.

339
00:21:25,531 --> 00:21:27,496
Speaker 0: That was Japan only.

340
00:21:27,857 --> 00:21:34,634
Speaker 0: yet the entire game voice acting and text was in 100% English Weird, huh?

341
00:21:35,175 --> 00:21:37,383
Speaker 0: And the game was only ever released in Japan.

342
00:21:37,604 --> 00:21:43,245
Speaker 1: now for the Xbox one The Xbox didn't do well and it was made.

343
00:21:43,265 --> 00:21:49,009
Speaker 0: it was made by the same developers that made What's it called?

344
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,424
Speaker 0: Armored armored core and chrome hounds and those games right from whatever actually there's.

345
00:21:55,806 --> 00:21:55,986
Speaker 1: sorry.

346
00:21:56,006 --> 00:21:56,749
Speaker 1: I'm thinking of something else.

347
00:21:56,909 --> 00:22:00,990
Speaker 0: go on Yeah, so there's a game called the metal wolf chaos.

348
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:04,885
Speaker 0: It's like this sort of unheard of game at least, you know by normal people.

349
00:22:04,926 --> 00:22:05,869
Speaker 0: So it's pretty obscure.

350
00:22:06,732 --> 00:22:14,758
Speaker 1: One up calm found out about it recently actually really and they they actually named it the quote most insanely patriotic game ever made.

351
00:22:14,778 --> 00:22:19,404
Speaker 0: all right, um, I Don't really want to give away with the games about.

352
00:22:19,485 --> 00:22:21,655
Speaker 0: I know Ruins all the humor of it.

353
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:25,489
Speaker 1: I want to because I want to say funny things about it.

354
00:22:25,810 --> 00:22:30,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time you need to experience this video the way Scott Emily and I experienced it.

355
00:22:31,332 --> 00:22:35,550
Speaker 0: Because just watch the whole thing because even if it's not funny it gets.

356
00:22:36,714 --> 00:22:37,622
Speaker 0: They watch the whole thing.

357
00:22:37,703 --> 00:22:38,349
Speaker 0: Don't stop it.

358
00:22:39,293 --> 00:22:40,316
Speaker 1: It escalates.

359
00:22:40,537 --> 00:22:44,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, and every time you think you saw the funny bit it continues to escalate.

360
00:22:44,771 --> 00:22:50,120
Speaker 0: The thing is is that when I was a kid, I had this choose your own adventure book But it wasn't actually.

361
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,070
Speaker 0: choose your own adventure book.

362
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,554
Speaker 0: it was a TSR produced.

363
00:22:52,675 --> 00:23:00,179
Speaker 0: choose your own adventure book and it was almost exactly the same as Story as this.

364
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:00,962
Speaker 1: I can say.

365
00:23:01,002 --> 00:23:02,148
Speaker 1: I'm gonna say one thing.

366
00:23:03,174 --> 00:23:08,228
Speaker 1: according to Wikipedia people Who have played the game or looked at the game?

367
00:23:08,870 --> 00:23:13,443
Speaker 1: Notice the relative eye level that the main character has.

368
00:23:13,463 --> 00:23:25,100
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna spoil who the main character is In relation to everyone else and he must be 11 feet tall Which kind of works.

369
00:23:25,724 --> 00:23:29,189
Speaker 0: it totally makes sense Makes perfect sense.

370
00:23:30,052 --> 00:23:31,560
Speaker 1: This game is fantastic.

371
00:23:31,580 --> 00:23:33,290
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's actually good, but it's fantastic.

372
00:23:33,971 --> 00:23:36,199
Speaker 0: No, it's a third-person action shooter.

373
00:23:36,259 --> 00:23:36,821
Speaker 0: You know, it's.

374
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:52,650
Speaker 0: it's probably it is what it is, but Watching it on YouTube You're gonna get what it's worth and if you wanted to you could probably easily go and download the game on some Torrance and then Burn it to a CD or DVD or whatever and put it in your Xbox or something like that and it would work.

375
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,599
Speaker 1: Yeah, the the internet is my.

376
00:23:54,659 --> 00:23:56,026
Speaker 0: I don't know if you had to mod an Xbox.

377
00:23:56,046 --> 00:23:56,870
Speaker 0: I don't know how that shit works.

378
00:23:57,753 --> 00:23:59,680
Speaker 0: Definitely possible in some way.

379
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,523
Speaker 0: I don't know.

380
00:24:00,543 --> 00:24:01,205
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

381
00:24:01,225 --> 00:24:02,690
Speaker 0: The Xbox modding was huge, right?

382
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,485
Speaker 0: People installed all sorts of crazy shit on there.

383
00:24:04,566 --> 00:24:06,432
Speaker 0: I don't know What.

384
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:11,230
Speaker 1: if Daryl Surratt is the cause of the resurgence or if he found out about it because of the resurgence?

385
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:23,970
Speaker 0: But he said that like there was a panel at a convention He did recently where he was trying to do an anime and video game panel You know where he showed anime based video games that were good, but he just whipped this out You know because it's so great even if it's not anime.

386
00:24:24,150 --> 00:24:32,193
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I'm looking around now and I'm finding a lot of very recent references to it where there were no references before Huh?

387
00:24:32,354 --> 00:24:32,858
Speaker 0: Well get it.

388
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:34,509
Speaker 0: while it's hot people Metal Wolf chaos.

389
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:43,210
Speaker 1: So we had the privilege actually Torrance will be rocking right now last weekend of seeing the New York premiere.

390
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:50,260
Speaker 1: I don't know if it was the American premiere, but it was definitely the New York premiere of Mamoru Oshii's new movie Scott new animated movie.

391
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,142
Speaker 0: Yes Scott.

392
00:24:51,162 --> 00:24:52,567
Speaker 1: Well, I think it's the newest movie.

393
00:24:52,587 --> 00:24:55,919
Speaker 1: He made possibly I'll check that but skycrawlers.

394
00:24:56,482 --> 00:24:56,663
Speaker 0: Yep.

395
00:24:57,325 --> 00:25:05,090
Speaker 0: It was a Mamoru og animated movie, you know just like ghost in the shell or beautiful dreamer or the Pat LeBourne movies.

396
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:10,303
Speaker 0: You know two plus something hours long Crazy high quality animation.

397
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:11,348
Speaker 1: Oh my god the end.

398
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:14,528
Speaker 1: We're gonna review it but we're not going to see.

399
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:27,610
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, usually it seems like these days like, you know directors and just artists in general Sort of like trying to get away from their sticks, you know, well, he doesn't go away from his stick.

400
00:25:27,671 --> 00:25:29,110
Speaker 0: I mean that you showed me this movie.

401
00:25:29,592 --> 00:25:32,121
Speaker 0: I could have been like oh it was and you said who's the director?

402
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:33,486
Speaker 0: like 10 minutes in.

403
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:34,711
Speaker 0: I would have been like I was oh She.

404
00:25:34,731 --> 00:25:37,770
Speaker 0: yeah now as soon as you see like the freaking dog.

405
00:25:38,512 --> 00:25:47,987
Speaker 1: If I'd only seen the first I don't know 15 minutes and I knew the plot but I hadn't seen the rest I might have guessed that maybe shiro wrote it or something, but

406
00:25:49,691 --> 00:25:51,478
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's a tough call and that kind

407
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:55,910
Speaker 1: of but it's definitely oh she all the way that the one thing I noticed Is that we went with a whole bunch of people?

408
00:25:56,310 --> 00:26:05,955
Speaker 0: The thing is as soon as you when you think shiro in an anime you go to oh She because you know, he directed the ghost in the shell one and two and so it's like, you know It makes perfect sense,

409
00:26:06,317 --> 00:26:08,710
Speaker 1: but no shiro had nothing to do with this at all.

410
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:09,452
Speaker 1: This is all.

411
00:26:09,573 --> 00:26:11,298
Speaker 1: oh, she adapted from a novel.

412
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,265
Speaker 0: But yeah, what was the novel?

413
00:26:13,305 --> 00:26:13,686
Speaker 0: I forget.

414
00:26:13,867 --> 00:26:14,308
Speaker 1: Oh the not.

415
00:26:14,328 --> 00:26:14,870
Speaker 1: well get to that.

416
00:26:14,950 --> 00:26:17,010
Speaker 1: I'll get to the whole history of what this is and where it came from.

417
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:24,810
Speaker 1: But we went with a whole bunch of people like we ran into uncle yo and a whole bunch of people I love living in New York at this showing like we didn't coordinate this.

418
00:26:25,132 --> 00:26:33,130
Speaker 1: It seems like every time there's an anime screening like a big one in New York City If we go we see like the same posse of people there every time.

419
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:40,210
Speaker 0: I definitely saw a lot of people there that were also at the Satoshi khan thing and the cool thing was the same exact theater.

420
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:47,999
Speaker 1: So, oh, she actually recorded a little short like a three-minute video of himself Really shabby looking in front of a wall.

421
00:26:48,019 --> 00:26:48,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like he.

422
00:26:48,943 --> 00:26:50,188
Speaker 0: this is worse than a YouTube.

423
00:26:50,248 --> 00:26:55,530
Speaker 0: basically It's like you think a guy with all this, you know, like movie making skill would make a better video of himself.

424
00:26:55,651 --> 00:26:58,290
Speaker 0: It's like he was like wearing like a ratty white.

425
00:26:58,410 --> 00:27:04,734
Speaker 0: He looked like some nasty otaku who basically and he's sitting in front of this camera real close to his face That way it had heart.

426
00:27:04,794 --> 00:27:06,059
Speaker 1: It was like he's sitting down with you.

427
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:08,770
Speaker 1: Like look I sent this movie over to you Americans.

428
00:27:08,830 --> 00:27:11,400
Speaker 0: It's like thanks for coming to the New York premiere.

429
00:27:11,862 --> 00:27:12,926
Speaker 0: This is my movie.

430
00:27:13,047 --> 00:27:16,141
Speaker 0: It's about this It's also about this and it's also about this.

431
00:27:16,543 --> 00:27:17,829
Speaker 0: Please stay until the end.

432
00:27:18,594 --> 00:27:23,864
Speaker 0: That guy got a lot of laughs because you know His movies are long and so it's sort of like we thought he was see.

433
00:27:23,904 --> 00:27:28,503
Speaker 0: we thought he was saying Please stay until the end because maybe it's long and you'll get bored.

434
00:27:28,704 --> 00:27:34,964
Speaker 0: It is over two hours long Yeah, but actually he was saying stay until the very end after the credits because there's more.

435
00:27:34,985 --> 00:27:36,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, there is more.

436
00:27:36,429 --> 00:27:38,290
Speaker 1: we Made a critic.

437
00:27:38,572 --> 00:27:40,989
Speaker 0: We didn't really need to see it because it's sort of it.

438
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:44,201
Speaker 0: It's one of those things where after the credits they show you something.

439
00:27:44,542 --> 00:27:47,980
Speaker 0: now in some movies after the credits what they show you Is like game-changing?

440
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:49,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not like alien.

441
00:27:50,973 --> 00:27:52,118
Speaker 0: The whole show is in the credits.

442
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:56,659
Speaker 1: Yeah, the whole credits are like, oh by the way, here's what happened Everyone and oh look, we killed a bunch of people.

443
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,034
Speaker 0: the end in the credits the final craze less They.

444
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:02,409
Speaker 1: I remember Gabby's screaming from the other room.

445
00:28:02,554 --> 00:28:09,930
Speaker 0: Yeah No But in that what happens after the credits in this movie is basically a visual confirmation of things you already know.

446
00:28:10,532 --> 00:28:15,149
Speaker 0: So if you were paying attention to the movie itself now, it's not too bad that you missed it.

447
00:28:15,189 --> 00:28:18,990
Speaker 0: one thing I noticed and I it's actually good that we missed it because we probably wouldn't have made the tree.

448
00:28:19,532 --> 00:28:29,570
Speaker 1: I would recommend that any anime fans see this movie But very specifically if there is any way for you to see it in a theater see it in the theater.

449
00:28:29,590 --> 00:28:34,738
Speaker 0: Yeah, normally, you know, obviously Movies in the theater are far superior, right?

450
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,748
Speaker 0: But I'm usually not too anal about it.

451
00:28:37,828 --> 00:28:43,330
Speaker 0: It's like yeah I know the theaters better you get the big screen and the better sound.

452
00:28:43,671 --> 00:28:50,510
Speaker 0: But really if I want 90% of movies if you watch him in your home on a DVD player, it's good enough.

453
00:28:51,771 --> 00:28:54,386
Speaker 0: VHS isn't good enough, but a DVD with some speakers is good.

454
00:28:54,426 --> 00:28:55,030
Speaker 0: No, it depends.

455
00:28:55,090 --> 00:28:57,142
Speaker 1: I mean, is it a movie of people talking to each other?

456
00:28:57,162 --> 00:28:58,550
Speaker 1: Is it a movie of people shooting at?

457
00:28:59,775 --> 00:29:04,120
Speaker 0: You know while I'd rather watch Star Wars in the theater I can watch Star Wars on a DVD like a hundred times.

458
00:29:04,140 --> 00:29:09,424
Speaker 1: but no but it doesn't have the same effect though The one time I went and saw those Star Wars movies in the theater.

459
00:29:09,524 --> 00:29:10,870
Speaker 1: It was a different experience.

460
00:29:10,971 --> 00:29:11,353
Speaker 0: It was.

461
00:29:11,433 --> 00:29:21,250
Speaker 0: but but this movie like the theater Makes it anything is the theater we saw it in wasn't even like a really fancy digital theater with wicked sound.

462
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,810
Speaker 0: It was sort of like, you know, it's like an auditorium at the you know, Juilliard the school.

463
00:29:25,951 --> 00:29:26,534
Speaker 0: So it's like.

464
00:29:26,897 --> 00:29:29,090
Speaker 0: it's not that awesome a theater.

465
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:31,859
Speaker 1: It's not like a screen wise because I've been to local theaters lately.

466
00:29:31,899 --> 00:29:37,118
Speaker 1: in the screen itself how big it is relative to where the seats Are it's fantastic.

467
00:29:37,238 --> 00:29:44,647
Speaker 0: It's alright, but you know, it's not like go into an An IMAX or well even like even like you go to like the Lowe's.

468
00:29:44,688 --> 00:29:51,955
Speaker 0: like, you know Super digital theater with the stadium seating is you know in is a lot better than this screen, but it's not a bad screen It's just not.

469
00:29:52,236 --> 00:30:02,212
Speaker 1: it's not a super screen is what I'm saying, but skycrawlers Seeing it in the theater would be a completely different experience because this movie is the first Animated.

470
00:30:02,493 --> 00:30:07,910
Speaker 1: this movie has a new standard for prop plane dogfights.

471
00:30:08,090 --> 00:30:13,767
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there are lots of anime with airplanes shit tons like a row.

472
00:30:13,807 --> 00:30:17,250
Speaker 0: so you got you know I'm not just you know jet fighters and prop planes.

473
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:21,970
Speaker 0: I mean you got you know, all those Miyazakis with airplanes in an area 88 the blue skies.

474
00:30:24,196 --> 00:30:26,101
Speaker 0: You know the list goes on and on and on.

475
00:30:26,381 --> 00:30:29,730
Speaker 0: planes and flight are huge but in the anime.

476
00:30:29,931 --> 00:30:31,883
Speaker 1: But this movie took it to a level.

477
00:30:32,165 --> 00:30:47,430
Speaker 0: It's well over 29,000 in the CG era right with surround sound full length in movie theater theatrical anime, right There hasn't really been a big one with the planes.

478
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:53,314
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess steam boy had a bit of flight in it kind of little bit not so much I mean what else.

479
00:30:53,415 --> 00:30:55,664
Speaker 0: what else really has there been recently in the theaters?

480
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:59,468
Speaker 0: I Guess was oh, what was the one?

481
00:31:00,673 --> 00:31:10,106
Speaker 0: By Makoto Shinkai the oh, yeah I could look it up and like one plane right with the big tower the one that you like.

482
00:31:10,126 --> 00:31:14,350
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Yeah, yeah place promised in early days place promise in one plane.

483
00:31:14,532 --> 00:31:16,832
Speaker 0: That was sort of a you know Anime movie.

484
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:27,285
Speaker 0: but this is the first anime movie that I can think of in like the CG era to go full-on With the planes with the sound with the CG with everything it did

485
00:31:27,345 --> 00:31:33,079
Speaker 1: the blurry shaky cam super awesome Choreographed dogfights and because they were like man

486
00:31:33,099 --> 00:31:36,410
Speaker 0: cross zero macros plus you got nothing on this shit.

487
00:31:36,617 --> 00:31:37,091
Speaker 0: All right He did.

488
00:31:37,111 --> 00:31:39,644
Speaker 0: he basically said you know what every anime has done planes.

489
00:31:39,965 --> 00:31:52,090
Speaker 1: if I do planes I have to show everyone up times a million and he did and I think it really helps that they're prop planes because you get All those like s turns and maneuvers that don't really like modern fighter jets.

490
00:31:52,452 --> 00:31:56,270
Speaker 1: Don't really dogfight so much as shoot missiles at enemies who are over the horizon.

491
00:31:56,731 --> 00:32:00,623
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much but oh my god like if nothing else.

492
00:32:00,844 --> 00:32:06,230
Speaker 1: even if you hate this movie and you hate, you know two hour long introspective philosophical atmospheric movies.

493
00:32:07,291 --> 00:32:09,297
Speaker 1: Watch this movie for the dogfights.

494
00:32:09,377 --> 00:32:10,019
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

495
00:32:10,059 --> 00:32:12,306
Speaker 0: this is one of those movies where it's like.

496
00:32:12,346 --> 00:32:18,130
Speaker 0: sometimes you get something That's you know real intellectual and deep and slow and most people be bored by it.

497
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:22,090
Speaker 0: But you know cool people will love it or whatever or pretentious people will love it depending, right?

498
00:32:22,613 --> 00:32:27,936
Speaker 0: But this is one of those ones that can be enjoyed on multiple levels Which is really what you want to go for right?

499
00:32:28,337 --> 00:32:28,719
Speaker 0: You can.

500
00:32:28,979 --> 00:32:32,390
Speaker 0: he's got this deep message going on that comes across really well.

501
00:32:33,211 --> 00:32:36,064
Speaker 0: He's got you know, like this great character development thing.

502
00:32:36,124 --> 00:32:37,350
Speaker 0: It's got this ongoing plot.

503
00:32:37,450 --> 00:32:42,190
Speaker 0: It's got a sci-fi plot, but on the surface level he's got his fucking action.

504
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:44,029
Speaker 0: Just there you go.

505
00:32:44,191 --> 00:32:51,670
Speaker 0: If you if you don't get all that shit and don't care about it You will still love this movie for the fucking airplanes that are really loud with lots of explode.

506
00:32:51,710 --> 00:33:02,267
Speaker 1: However, do not forget that is a Mamoru Oshii movie because I think a lot of our friends who came with us a Lot of people didn't really like it when we got out of the theater.

507
00:33:02,448 --> 00:33:06,885
Speaker 0: and yeah I mean, it's not the greatest movie ever, but it's a good movie.

508
00:33:06,925 --> 00:33:07,366
Speaker 0: I liked it.

509
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:08,290
Speaker 1: I thought it was good.

510
00:33:08,772 --> 00:33:10,056
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's in my top hundred.

511
00:33:10,076 --> 00:33:11,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely.

512
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:12,505
Speaker 1: It's easy to get into my top hundred.

513
00:33:12,526 --> 00:33:13,630
Speaker 1: It's definitely in there.

514
00:33:13,991 --> 00:33:14,774
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

515
00:33:15,095 --> 00:33:17,925
Speaker 1: It might be in the top 50, but maybe not.

516
00:33:17,945 --> 00:33:18,407
Speaker 0: I don't know.

517
00:33:18,427 --> 00:33:19,290
Speaker 0: I have to start counting.

518
00:33:19,531 --> 00:33:21,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'd have to count at that point, you know, it's a pretty.

519
00:33:22,006 --> 00:33:22,570
Speaker 0: it's pretty good.

520
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:24,400
Speaker 0: It's like seven or eight stars out of ten.

521
00:33:24,420 --> 00:33:26,030
Speaker 1: if you're an anime fan first off.

522
00:33:26,492 --> 00:33:26,934
Speaker 1: It's not like.

523
00:33:26,954 --> 00:33:29,605
Speaker 1: there's that many anime movies you get to see that are new.

524
00:33:30,067 --> 00:33:30,810
Speaker 0: that's in America.

525
00:33:30,991 --> 00:33:35,569
Speaker 0: So any anime, I don't know if anyone's gonna get to see this in the theater in America besides us.

526
00:33:36,232 --> 00:33:41,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe out in the West Coast, but yeah this movie I get after the movie.

527
00:33:41,371 --> 00:33:44,604
Speaker 1: What a lot of people said who didn't like it was that was really long.

528
00:33:44,905 --> 00:33:46,050
Speaker 1: That was really repetitive.

529
00:33:46,552 --> 00:33:48,539
Speaker 1: The the character development was weird.

530
00:33:48,619 --> 00:33:54,300
Speaker 1: It was all atmosphere and no plot and to which I said Yeah, it was directed by Mamoru.

531
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,424
Speaker 1: She it's like.

532
00:33:55,464 --> 00:33:57,050
Speaker 0: have you not seen his movies before?

533
00:33:58,130 --> 00:33:59,195
Speaker 1: Exactly like this.

534
00:33:59,336 --> 00:34:03,132
Speaker 1: I went in expecting this and I got exactly what I wanted and I was very pleased I was.

535
00:34:03,192 --> 00:34:14,188
Speaker 0: quiet scenes lots of scenes where a character you watch characters like performing everyday actions in like real time Quietly and slowly.

536
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:28,368
Speaker 1: Granted it's not to the level of the the cats on the train in space where I get to see him Slowly walk to a door slowly open the door walk through the door turn around slowly close the door turn around walk away.

537
00:34:28,527 --> 00:34:28,789
Speaker 0: quiet.

538
00:34:28,809 --> 00:34:36,069
Speaker 1: you Like my quiet in space I know but that that movie took you too far.

539
00:34:37,231 --> 00:34:44,333
Speaker 1: Though I have quiet in space as you can get I have this evil idea to take Odean and All any see.

540
00:34:44,353 --> 00:34:46,420
Speaker 0: hide it together with not in the galactic era any

541
00:34:46,460 --> 00:35:00,790
Speaker 1: scene that just shows space or like an atmosphere scene extend and extend and copy paste copy paste and Make it five hours long secretly and then run the who can watch this movie to the end contest late at night at a con

542
00:35:03,211 --> 00:35:05,399
Speaker 0: With the with these special elongated

543
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:06,161
Speaker 1: cut.

544
00:35:06,201 --> 00:35:06,903
Speaker 1: I'll call it.

545
00:35:07,124 --> 00:35:08,609
Speaker 1: I'll call it the director's cut.

546
00:35:09,712 --> 00:35:13,621
Speaker 0: It's the elongated rim cut the the on abridged version.

547
00:35:13,882 --> 00:35:20,083
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll cut in some MD guys doesn't matter Just throw in some random shit towards the end.

548
00:35:20,123 --> 00:35:21,590
Speaker 0: I'll take losing it.

549
00:35:21,811 --> 00:35:27,415
Speaker 1: I'll just take all of MD guys and stick it in at the end like before Right before the credits just pay.

550
00:35:27,455 --> 00:35:32,089
Speaker 1: like they get near the end they find MD guys and then it's just MD guys from there.

551
00:35:33,713 --> 00:35:34,648
Speaker 0: That's most dangerous.

552
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:42,970
Speaker 1: But anyway The movie I guess part of the reason it seems like people had a problem with it though was that being an oshi movie.

553
00:35:43,852 --> 00:35:56,159
Speaker 1: the form and structure of the film like the way it is put together and the fact that it's repetitive and the fact that they're the character develop my characters don't really develop is Critical to the message.

554
00:35:56,179 --> 00:36:06,763
Speaker 1: It's like if the movie were shorter or More like cut more finely or had fewer of these atmosphere scenes or had closure Not to spoil it but had closure.

555
00:36:06,784 --> 00:36:07,950
Speaker 1: that was expected.

556
00:36:08,972 --> 00:36:13,735
Speaker 1: Then it would have kind of betrayed what oh she was saying, you know Yeah, I mean in in.

557
00:36:13,776 --> 00:36:17,310
Speaker 0: I'll tell you because this isn't a spoiler because oh she told it to us.

558
00:36:17,531 --> 00:36:21,287
Speaker 0: You know indirectly before the movie started but he said the movie is about.

559
00:36:21,669 --> 00:36:30,188
Speaker 0: you know People who don't grow up and it's about You know whether living a life of daily routine is is worthwhile and such.

560
00:36:30,228 --> 00:36:30,570
Speaker 0: now, right?

561
00:36:30,970 --> 00:36:52,830
Speaker 0: So if you want to have this message of daily routine, you need to actually in the movie like show Routine and repetition and you know to deliver that and that necessarily at least, you know If your mom or oshi makes the movie sort of long and has lots of repeating things and routines That you get used to and then when the routines break that's when the movie goes.

562
00:36:52,930 --> 00:36:56,750
Speaker 0: Oh my god is typical, you know narrative technique there, you know.

563
00:36:56,750 --> 00:37:05,217
Speaker 1: but then the one of the big points was that even when the routines break also not a spoiler because Believe me you can watch this movie.

564
00:37:05,237 --> 00:37:07,585
Speaker 1: We're not gonna say anything where you're gonna go.

565
00:37:07,966 --> 00:37:08,106
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

566
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:13,181
Speaker 1: No, I can't watch it Mm-hmm, but uh, even when routines break did they really break?

567
00:37:13,662 --> 00:37:16,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I walk the same road to work every day.

568
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:18,618
Speaker 0: Well, I'll walk on the other side of it this time.

569
00:37:18,638 --> 00:37:23,814
Speaker 0: We're all look in a different direction this time and it talks I mean a lot of what we're thinking.

570
00:37:23,874 --> 00:37:32,650
Speaker 1: it's not just routines and how they affect people but the idea of immortality or aging or Being in a rut in your life or anything like that.

571
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:44,549
Speaker 1: I mean if one day is no different than the next if you live Wednesday the same as Tuesday the same as Monday Then are you really living three separate days or was your life turning into just one big day?

572
00:37:45,031 --> 00:37:47,220
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm one day where nothing new happens.

573
00:37:47,943 --> 00:37:51,818
Speaker 0: So I think I'll give you a tiny Non-spoilery plot summary.

574
00:37:51,858 --> 00:37:52,179
Speaker 0: Yes.

575
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,890
Speaker 1: Well, I mean it was based on a novel written by Hiroshi Mori.

576
00:37:55,171 --> 00:37:56,921
Speaker 1: Actually, it's a set of five novels.

577
00:37:57,182 --> 00:38:01,259
Speaker 0: Ah, well, you know in Japan They always break the novels up into little volumes that we get a little ones.

578
00:38:01,299 --> 00:38:01,841
Speaker 0: Yeah.

579
00:38:02,182 --> 00:38:02,423
Speaker 1: Yeah.

580
00:38:02,543 --> 00:38:08,742
Speaker 1: Yeah, but basically though This series is a deviation from his usual works in a big way.

581
00:38:08,882 --> 00:38:09,424
Speaker 1: Really?

582
00:38:09,504 --> 00:38:09,705
Speaker 1: Yes.

583
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:11,590
Speaker 1: Apparently he writes mystery novels.

584
00:38:11,953 --> 00:38:12,720
Speaker 0: Oh, I'd like to see.

585
00:38:12,841 --> 00:38:22,214
Speaker 0: I wish that more Japanese book books were translated to English, you know, and they kept him in that same tiny format, you know And and the same prices.

586
00:38:22,254 --> 00:38:27,230
Speaker 1: and well, yeah, he's a. he's a writer and an engineer who's famous for writing mystery novels in Japan.

587
00:38:29,052 --> 00:38:29,936
Speaker 0: I'd like to get me some of that.

588
00:38:29,977 --> 00:38:40,721
Speaker 0: and then out of the blue he wrote this stuff sweet all right, basically the story you have here is there's a guy and He I'm not gonna and he goes to work.

589
00:38:40,922 --> 00:38:41,524
Speaker 1: Oh, okay.

590
00:38:41,564 --> 00:38:43,070
Speaker 1: I gotta go one step further with this guy.

591
00:38:43,531 --> 00:38:45,818
Speaker 1: He writes a very specific kind of mystery story.

592
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:57,340
Speaker 1: He calls them Rakei mysteries science mysteries math mysteries, ah man Apparently maybe I should go buy.

593
00:38:57,401 --> 00:38:58,790
Speaker 0: that's like stupid rosette.

594
00:39:00,514 --> 00:39:05,667
Speaker 1: The perfect insider is quotes often criticized for its overuse of computer jargon.

595
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:14,209
Speaker 1: No He responded by saying that is perfectly natural for people with a background Of knowledge and technology to better understand others.

596
00:39:15,133 --> 00:39:16,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah jargon.

597
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:21,670
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway, so the movie Even oh man, I find it all these things.

598
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:29,797
Speaker 1: He talks about how using computer jargon in a book with computers is no different than using Fantasy jargon in a book about fantasy.

599
00:39:30,058 --> 00:39:31,021
Speaker 1: It's just proper nouns.

600
00:39:31,362 --> 00:39:31,603
Speaker 0: Yeah.

601
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:33,730
Speaker 0: Anyway, anyway, so the movie.

602
00:39:34,191 --> 00:39:42,690
Speaker 0: It's about a guy who goes to work at you know, basically a military base, but it's a military base That just has a few planes, you know, it's like a little Air Force base, you know tiny one.

603
00:39:42,954 --> 00:39:54,695
Speaker 0: They got a hangar they got a little building with some you know rooms to sleep in and a couple offices and a little eating room and whatever right up and he works for some company and There's some people at the base.

604
00:39:54,735 --> 00:39:57,021
Speaker 0: There's the the lady who fixes the planes.

605
00:39:57,483 --> 00:39:58,405
Speaker 0: There's the other pilots.

606
00:39:58,967 --> 00:40:01,036
Speaker 0: There's the Commander lady.

607
00:40:01,056 --> 00:40:09,944
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's obviously a whole command structure but at the beginning of the movie you get the impression that there's Some sort of war going on and that this company is a part of it in some way.

608
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:18,487
Speaker 1: and they're either in providing the technology or It's not made clear immediately and it is made Crystal clear by the end of the movie.

609
00:40:18,527 --> 00:40:27,662
Speaker 0: definitely Yeah, you know they you know, he gets there and you know, you meet these characters and all the characters You know are sort of have mysteries about them.

610
00:40:27,722 --> 00:40:31,696
Speaker 0: just you know, they say very little, you know They're acting strangely.

611
00:40:31,757 --> 00:40:45,538
Speaker 0: this there things that are weird and are not fully explained You know and you don't even know why they're fighting or what happened before this or anything like that movie really feels Like a dream, which is also I mean remember.

612
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:49,150
Speaker 1: Oh, she also did beautiful dreamer, which was about dreams directly.

613
00:40:49,190 --> 00:40:51,737
Speaker 1: Yeah And it had the same kind of its dream.

614
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:59,808
Speaker 1: like scenes flow into each other like there's really no beginning or end It kind of starts in media res and ends in media res.

615
00:40:59,828 --> 00:41:08,554
Speaker 0: Yep So they go on all that, you know, they go on missions and they you know They fight and they do recon and stuff like that and you know They do things.

616
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:11,910
Speaker 0: whether you know, it also shows you what they're doing when they're not going on missions.

617
00:41:11,950 --> 00:41:17,910
Speaker 0: You know going to the diner eating a meat pie, you know getting some hose that's or you know things that pilots do.

618
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:20,560
Speaker 1: I actually really like the two prostitute characters.

619
00:41:20,721 --> 00:41:21,584
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're pretty cool.

620
00:41:21,704 --> 00:41:23,150
Speaker 0: They're actually some of the better characters.

621
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:27,303
Speaker 1: Yes, but that but that that's very important to what he was saying.

622
00:41:27,684 --> 00:41:28,347
Speaker 0: I know right?

623
00:41:28,407 --> 00:41:28,748
Speaker 0: Yeah.

624
00:41:28,969 --> 00:41:40,364
Speaker 0: Yeah But yeah, and then, you know, basically the movie just consists of you know time going by day by day you know things that happen and slowly things are revealed.

625
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:57,564
Speaker 0: and as things are revealed and The characters learn more about each other and about you know things that are going on You know situations evolve as such and then you have a movie and you know by the end You learn everything you need to learn and it's it's what you do.

626
00:41:57,624 --> 00:41:59,230
Speaker 0: learn is pretty crazy.

627
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:08,374
Speaker 0: the only thing that I had to say about it though is that There was the scene where they went to the diner for the first time and then afterwards they got in the car and he was Like, how was the meat pie?

628
00:42:08,394 --> 00:42:11,306
Speaker 0: And at that moment, I knew everything that was.

629
00:42:11,627 --> 00:42:12,430
Speaker 0: I knew the whole movie.

630
00:42:12,450 --> 00:42:13,381
Speaker 0: I already figured it out.

631
00:42:13,442 --> 00:42:13,988
Speaker 0: It was solved.

632
00:42:14,792 --> 00:42:16,748
Speaker 1: See, I figured it out a bit before that.

633
00:42:17,631 --> 00:42:19,560
Speaker 1: Well, everyone can say the scene if you.

634
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:26,621
Speaker 0: basically it's like if you pay attention You can figure the whole movie out But at the same time you're not gonna figure out all the things.

635
00:42:26,702 --> 00:42:29,893
Speaker 1: Oh, she's trying to say because he makes a lot of points He makes like.

636
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:36,941
Speaker 0: it's like he has like two or three big things to say and then he's got a lot of little things to Say throughout, you know, so it's like you can get.

637
00:42:36,981 --> 00:42:39,130
Speaker 0: the big plot thing is pretty obvious.

638
00:42:39,351 --> 00:42:41,622
Speaker 0: You can get real close to it or close enough to where.

639
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:43,410
Speaker 0: it doesn't matter that you're not right on target.

640
00:42:43,933 --> 00:42:47,450
Speaker 0: But you know, you still watch the rest of the movie did all the little stuff, you know.

641
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:50,846
Speaker 0: And I guess if you're not smart, you won't figure it out until the end and you'll go.

642
00:42:50,966 --> 00:42:54,874
Speaker 1: Oh shit The movie I don't know.

643
00:42:54,954 --> 00:42:57,484
Speaker 1: I thought this movie also the teacher.

644
00:42:57,504 --> 00:42:59,090
Speaker 1: oh my god the teacher.

645
00:42:59,191 --> 00:43:00,490
Speaker 0: I think the teacher might be my favorite.

646
00:43:02,072 --> 00:43:15,569
Speaker 1: Of course that thing on the side of his plane made me kept my reminding me of the Thundercats though I want to point out something interesting here because The movie was directed by oshi, but the screenplay was written by someone named Chihiro Ito.

647
00:43:17,210 --> 00:43:22,350
Speaker 1: Chihiro Ito is known for one other anime a very important anime.

648
00:43:22,752 --> 00:43:26,369
Speaker 1: You see he did the key animation for perverse investigations.

649
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:33,329
Speaker 1: Key animation big deal perverse investigations also has the alternate title sex judge.

650
00:43:35,111 --> 00:43:36,435
Speaker 1: It's the only two things he's done.

651
00:43:36,455 --> 00:43:41,550
Speaker 0: unless yeah the I'm sure he's done something else that they let him write a screenplay.

652
00:43:42,153 --> 00:43:43,139
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

653
00:43:43,199 --> 00:43:44,023
Speaker 1: at least he's done nothing.

654
00:43:44,043 --> 00:43:49,490
Speaker 1: the same person Unless see I'm basing this entirely on the anime news network.

655
00:43:49,554 --> 00:43:49,659
Speaker 1: And

656
00:43:49,681 --> 00:43:56,413
Speaker 0: yeah He's probably done a lot of live action or something like that and it's probably it might even be a different person who did that Anime, you know

657
00:43:56,433 --> 00:44:00,550
Speaker 1: it is possible, but I was surprised to find that when I was clicking on the links of all the people

658
00:44:05,013 --> 00:44:05,958
Speaker 0: We had to go get a guy.

659
00:44:05,978 --> 00:44:07,164
Speaker 0: bet you know we should.

660
00:44:07,204 --> 00:44:08,350
Speaker 0: we don't own any hentai's.

661
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:12,106
Speaker 0: You know I'm not really big fan of the hentai's even though if you like him.

662
00:44:12,126 --> 00:44:12,950
Speaker 0: That's that's your deal.

663
00:44:13,117 --> 00:44:14,335
Speaker 1: well I can say this.

664
00:44:14,476 --> 00:44:20,080
Speaker 1: I have somewhere it's found one of those hard drives a Downloaded copy of the first episode of elven bride.

665
00:44:20,401 --> 00:44:20,702
Speaker 0: great.

666
00:44:20,823 --> 00:44:22,228
Speaker 0: That was right as a comedy though.

667
00:44:22,248 --> 00:44:22,689
Speaker 0: It's not a.

668
00:44:22,770 --> 00:44:24,636
Speaker 1: well It's a sexy comedy.

669
00:44:24,776 --> 00:44:33,246
Speaker 0: yeah, but there was in a sexy comedy, and you know which is intended for humor But happens to be sexy and something that is intended for.

670
00:44:33,548 --> 00:44:35,875
Speaker 0: you know Titillation.

671
00:44:36,036 --> 00:44:38,130
Speaker 0: well yeah, he's viewed comedically.

672
00:44:38,271 --> 00:44:38,612
Speaker 1: It's funny.

673
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:42,028
Speaker 1: you say titillation because I think that was intended at least a little bit.

674
00:44:42,048 --> 00:44:43,209
Speaker 0: yeah Yeah, of course.

675
00:44:43,711 --> 00:44:51,548
Speaker 0: But I think if we're gonna on his quest to get the harpy you if we're gonna go and get some you know hentai for comedic purposes.

676
00:44:52,995 --> 00:44:56,659
Speaker 0: You know Sex judge sounds like a pretty good one to go for.

677
00:44:56,679 --> 00:45:00,929
Speaker 1: no just based on the title alone sex judge sounds like something Dave and Joel should review.

678
00:45:02,132 --> 00:45:04,885
Speaker 0: It just sounds so funny like I imagine.

679
00:45:04,945 --> 00:45:05,830
Speaker 1: It's not that funny.

680
00:45:06,432 --> 00:45:08,358
Speaker 0: Maybe not imagine, but the name I can.

681
00:45:08,899 --> 00:45:09,160
Speaker 0: I can.

682
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:12,110
Speaker 0: I can imagine it being really hilarious based on the name.

683
00:45:12,755 --> 00:45:14,370
Speaker 1: Oh, there isn't even a description here.

684
00:45:17,271 --> 00:45:17,793
Speaker 1: It's voted.

685
00:45:18,154 --> 00:45:19,639
Speaker 1: one person said it was very good.

686
00:45:19,659 --> 00:45:22,027
Speaker 1: really only one person said it was.

687
00:45:22,047 --> 00:45:23,989
Speaker 0: that person is the sex-defendant.

688
00:45:26,612 --> 00:45:28,650
Speaker 0: The one person who said it was awful was the sex plaintiff.

689
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,521
Speaker 1: 51 people on the animators network have seen it.

690
00:45:32,822 --> 00:45:34,409
Speaker 0: wow that said too many.

691
00:45:36,050 --> 00:45:43,679
Speaker 1: But anyway this movie one thing I want to say is that you know we talked about how you should see in the theater is Beautiful, but I can't stress enough this movie is beautiful.

692
00:45:44,522 --> 00:45:46,266
Speaker 1: It is absolutely beautiful.

693
00:45:46,306 --> 00:45:49,456
Speaker 0: It's a production IG 2008 movie.

694
00:45:49,838 --> 00:45:51,729
Speaker 0: what do you expect you know?

695
00:45:52,130 --> 00:46:02,830
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess sometimes the anime studios that have the big skills and the big money's you know put out something That's lower quality to save money and cuz they don't care, but yeah, they they put it all into this one.

696
00:46:02,951 --> 00:46:05,008
Speaker 0: You know it's like it's just got the.

697
00:46:05,028 --> 00:46:08,770
Speaker 0: you know It's the same people who you know who'd worked on like ghost in the shell to innocence.

698
00:46:08,931 --> 00:46:13,677
Speaker 0: That's the kind of high-quality amazing animation You're looking at now suppose newer than that.

699
00:46:13,757 --> 00:46:20,493
Speaker 1: even the the author of the book because this was such a big departure from his other Stuff he said that it would have been of any work He's written.

700
00:46:20,553 --> 00:46:22,806
Speaker 1: it would have been the most difficult to adapt to screen.

701
00:46:23,209 --> 00:46:27,071
Speaker 0: well And he never wanted including his computer jargon mister I guess.

702
00:46:27,412 --> 00:46:34,746
Speaker 1: but the only reason he gave consent to have this movie made was because he found out that oh She wanted to direct it.

703
00:46:35,050 --> 00:46:41,909
Speaker 1: Oh Which makes sense because for what the movie is only oh she could have done this.

704
00:46:43,076 --> 00:46:45,130
Speaker 0: Was it like I couldn't imagine?

705
00:46:45,570 --> 00:46:49,082
Speaker 0: like taking this plot and having it being done by like anyone else?

706
00:46:49,183 --> 00:46:50,306
Speaker 0: really it just wouldn't.

707
00:46:50,327 --> 00:46:54,465
Speaker 0: I Just wouldn't see it working like I try to imagine this.

708
00:46:54,505 --> 00:46:55,590
Speaker 0: you know the base.

709
00:46:55,670 --> 00:47:01,885
Speaker 0: I take the core plot of what this movie is and I think of it as directed by You know say like Takashi Mika.

710
00:47:01,945 --> 00:47:02,530
Speaker 0: No wouldn't work.

711
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:05,297
Speaker 0: Well, I mean this directed by you know Anno.

712
00:47:05,478 --> 00:47:06,340
Speaker 0: No that would work.

713
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:07,483
Speaker 0: the niche now.

714
00:47:07,503 --> 00:47:08,105
Speaker 0: It wouldn't work.

715
00:47:08,426 --> 00:47:09,248
Speaker 1: This is a movie.

716
00:47:09,649 --> 00:47:11,681
Speaker 0: however Miyazaki wouldn't work.

717
00:47:12,227 --> 00:47:12,510
Speaker 1: where?

718
00:47:13,530 --> 00:47:14,272
Speaker 1: The characters?

719
00:47:14,533 --> 00:47:19,847
Speaker 1: for most of the movie most of the characters do not have any character development at all.

720
00:47:20,429 --> 00:47:29,468
Speaker 0: and yet Well instead of as a poke because instead of doing the character development thing is the character revelation where they're already developed But you don't know them, and then you learn them.

721
00:47:29,488 --> 00:47:39,959
Speaker 1: well Yes, but what I want to say is that in many movies where this would be a flaw Oh She what he has done is made that like one of these Strongest points of the movie like the movie wouldn't work any other way.

722
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:41,142
Speaker 1: hmm.

723
00:47:41,202 --> 00:47:46,943

00:49:22,631 --> 00:49:26,182
Speaker 1: No, this website says it's going to be released in October of 2008.

753
00:49:26,182 --> 00:49:28,450
Speaker 0: So maybe it's out in Japan.

754
00:49:29,611 --> 00:49:32,423
Speaker 1: I'll look into that because I want to play that game possibly.

755
00:49:32,443 --> 00:49:34,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, well you're gonna need a Japanese Wii.

756
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, can I mod your Wii?

Speaker 0: you can buy another weed?

758
00:49:40,212 --> 00:49:42,644
Speaker 1: But I don't want to say anymore without.

759
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:43,790
Speaker 1: I mean eventually.

760
00:49:43,971 --> 00:49:46,601
Speaker 1: I do want to do a final thoughts like a full review.

761
00:49:46,621 --> 00:49:48,970
Speaker 0: the movie gets released on DVD in the u.s.

762
00:49:49,130 --> 00:49:49,974
Speaker 0: Then we'll do a thing.

763
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:53,310
Speaker 0: Yes, because in fact, I'm sure it will be eventually, right?

764
00:49:53,430 --> 00:49:56,280
Speaker 0: It's a Sony classics and they put out paprika.

765
00:49:56,380 --> 00:49:56,801
Speaker 1: I do.

766
00:49:56,821 --> 00:49:58,146
Speaker 0: So why wouldn't they put out sky crawl?

767
00:49:58,206 --> 00:50:02,542
Speaker 1: I do want to start Suggesting to people kind of like we have the geek nights book club.

768
00:50:02,563 --> 00:50:03,970
Speaker 1: That's going pretty well.

769
00:50:04,632 --> 00:50:16,322
Speaker 1: I want to warn people and then eventually do full reviews of anime movies because there aren't that many that are widely seen in the US and Reviewing a movie is difficult without spoiling it other than doing what we did now.

770
00:50:16,403 --> 00:50:17,105
Speaker 1: I mean the review.

771
00:50:17,446 --> 00:50:17,868
Speaker 1: it's great.

772
00:50:17,928 --> 00:50:18,390
Speaker 1: Go see it.

773
00:50:18,490 --> 00:50:24,647
Speaker 1: However, if you're not smart, or if you don't like very long atmospheric movies, then you won't like it.

774
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:29,547
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, but this movie will probably be on DVD within 12 months.

775
00:50:30,471 --> 00:50:31,936
Speaker 0: I pretty much can guarantee that.

776
00:50:31,996 --> 00:50:36,529
Speaker 1: so but if you get a chance to see this movie in the theater do not pass that up.

777
00:50:36,874 --> 00:50:49,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely seriously Just for like that, you know the the planes alone and they even in the middle of the movie They put like the biggest plane fight ever Just to have it.

778
00:50:52,132 --> 00:51:03,827
Speaker 1: When that bomber blows up while it's trying to bang It's trying to drop its bombs and then it blows up and then all the bombs blow up and then it blows up so big It blows up the other bomber flying below it.

779
00:51:05,414 --> 00:51:14,620
Speaker 0: They just because most of the you know the most of the fights in the movie air air fights are like a few planes and a Few planes and then the middle of the movie like, you know what?

780
00:51:15,082 --> 00:51:17,250
Speaker 0: a million planes and a million planes.

781
00:51:17,878 --> 00:51:18,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah.

782
00:51:19,470 --> 00:51:20,812
Speaker 1: Also one thing I should point out.

783
00:51:21,473 --> 00:51:34,822
Speaker 0: It's so strange that a movie that has a partially anti otaku message right in a way Is also has is very much of a taco appeal it but then again trick him into watching make him feel bad like Ava.

784
00:51:36,773 --> 00:51:39,790
Speaker 1: Maybe Ava tricked people into watching and then the movie made them feel bad.

785
00:51:40,572 --> 00:51:45,730
Speaker 0: I guess it's like if I made a romantic comedy and then the moral was anyone likes romantic comedies is stupid.

786
00:51:47,051 --> 00:51:51,726
Speaker 1: But one thing I really should point out a good portion of this movie is in English.

787
00:51:51,746 --> 00:51:53,915
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, which is fine.

788
00:51:53,996 --> 00:51:55,282
Speaker 1: Don't that's not what I want to talk about.

789
00:51:55,664 --> 00:51:56,790
Speaker 1: But there's this guy about that.

790
00:51:56,910 --> 00:52:04,312
Speaker 1: There's this one point where they walk into that diner and it's the same background and look at the animation because the same people are Talking

791
00:52:05,074 --> 00:52:05,274
Speaker 0: but

792
00:52:05,776 --> 00:52:19,382
Speaker 1: this time it's really quiet and this one guy with a really big head and a really big mouth is Saying something very quietly, but just because there was nothing else and because it was a theater and the volume was real high We all heard what the guy said in the background.

793
00:52:19,924 --> 00:52:21,109
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna say what he said.

794
00:52:22,017 --> 00:52:28,670
Speaker 1: Watch for it Listen to what I heard it and I defy you to not crack up his stare.

795
00:52:28,831 --> 00:52:31,149
Speaker 0: I didn't crack up hysterically, but I was like, huh?

796
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:31,853
Speaker 1: He says it.

797
00:52:31,994 --> 00:52:36,735
Speaker 1: and well, I wouldn't have cracked up if if not for the fact that Did find anything.

798
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:41,490
Speaker 0: though, you know you talked about that after we left the theater and I very much noticed it.

799
00:52:41,791 --> 00:52:44,023
Speaker 0: You know, it's what you know, you watch a big long movie like this.

800
00:52:44,063 --> 00:52:45,450
Speaker 0: I've only seen it once in the theater.

801
00:52:45,691 --> 00:52:50,508
Speaker 0: You don't remember every little detail, but that was a very small detail that I remembered.

802
00:52:50,588 --> 00:52:58,465
Speaker 0: a whole distinctly remembered it and the fact that rim brought it up and was so Enthusiastic about it was like wow.

803
00:52:58,525 --> 00:52:59,190
Speaker 1: It wasn't just me.

804
00:52:59,310 --> 00:53:02,865
Speaker 1: the reason I laughed was I was like, uh, and I turned to the left.

805
00:53:02,965 --> 00:53:09,889
Speaker 1: I look at Emily and she's Simultaneously turned to look at me and we both meet eyes and realize we're looking at each other about the same thing.

806
00:53:10,158 --> 00:53:11,154
Speaker 1: Yeah and then we lost.

807
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:12,118
Speaker 0: it's like everyone.

808
00:53:12,198 --> 00:53:16,737
Speaker 0: everyone noticed this one little thing that was like It couldn't even need to be in the movie.

809
00:53:16,757 --> 00:53:18,221
Speaker 0: It meant nothing for the movie at all.

810
00:53:18,482 --> 00:53:25,734
Speaker 1: Yeah, I I could not even stretch a meaning to place It's just.

811
00:53:26,076 --> 00:53:32,079
Speaker 0: it's basically just noise effectively Plus notable scenes.

812
00:53:32,140 --> 00:53:43,536
Speaker 1: I mean, of course all the dogfights Much like how spider-man had the upside-down kiss this movie has the Kissing along with guns.

813
00:53:43,856 --> 00:53:50,680
Speaker 0: Yep, and also it says right after the great series of scenes in the city Oh my god, the bowling alley.

814
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:52,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, the bowling alley was great.

815
00:53:52,208 --> 00:53:54,157
Speaker 1: That was Fantastic.

816
00:53:54,218 --> 00:53:55,250
Speaker 0: bowling alley was awesome.

817
00:53:55,471 --> 00:53:58,018
Speaker 1: This movie is really really really.

818
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:00,165
Speaker 0: the diner was also pretty great like that.

819
00:54:00,205 --> 00:54:01,630
Speaker 0: They're like three or four diner scenes.

820
00:54:02,552 --> 00:54:03,958
Speaker 1: I can't recommend this movie enough.

821
00:54:03,978 --> 00:54:05,163
