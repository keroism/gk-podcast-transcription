1
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,290
Speaker 1: It's Monday, October 22nd.

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:11,773
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,422 --> 00:00:13,920
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,859
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,418
Speaker 1: Tonight, a fresh Windows Linux OS X.

6
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,398
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:32,460
Speaker 1: Ah, over the weekend we all went to the Renaissance Fair.

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,159
Speaker 1: Well, everyone but Scott.

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,193
Speaker 0: Ah, I stayed home and went, ah.

10
00:00:38,001 --> 00:00:40,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, though, I mean, I like Ren Fairs.

11
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,295
Speaker 1: I'll admit, Scott, that a Renaissance Fair might not be 100% up your alley.

12
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:46,225
Speaker 1: Yeah.

13
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:50,140
Speaker 1: But at the same time, something kinda awesome happened.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,020
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it was an awesome time for all of us in general.

15
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,220
Speaker 1: We hung out at Jess's house, which was like super cool.

16
00:00:55,143 --> 00:00:56,440
Speaker 1: We did all this stuff and ate food.

17
00:00:56,540 --> 00:01:02,980
Speaker 1: But we're at the Renaissance Fair and I had my turkey leg and I had my soup in a bread bowl and my other soup in a bread bowl and my dumplings.

18
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:08,040
Speaker 1: And this Renaissance Fair, they have such an awesome racket going.

19
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:12,320
Speaker 1: Like the amount of money they made was probably staggering.

20
00:01:13,160 --> 00:01:15,940
Speaker 0: Ah, the amount of money I saved then must be equally staggering.

21
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:24,498
Speaker 1: Well, the reason is very simply that they have it set up so that if you, say, are at the Renaissance Fair and you like wine.

22
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,480
Speaker 1: A lot of people go to these things like wine.

23
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,280
Speaker 1: There's wine and beer everywhere to drink.

24
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:33,540
Speaker 1: There's a winery set up, a permanent one, at the entrance/exit to the Renaissance Fair.

25
00:01:34,283 --> 00:01:36,553
Speaker 1: And they ran a 25% off if you buy a case of 12 or more.

26
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:44,418
Speaker 1: And they had a limited selection of very specific wines and tasting, just open tasting.

27
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:52,380
Speaker 1: So people are coming out of the Renaissance Fair in a rush at the end of the day after the big joust and everything and they're all kind of intoxicated anyway.

28
00:01:53,283 --> 00:01:55,180
Speaker 1: And they come upon free wine tasting.

29
00:01:55,863 --> 00:01:56,940
Speaker 1: And then they see a discount.

30
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:03,119
Speaker 1: And people were buying hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of dollars of wine, all of them, including me.

31
00:02:04,262 --> 00:02:06,500
Speaker 1: Thing is, the wine was actually really well-priced.

32
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:12,640
Speaker 1: And while their reds were kind of really generic, all their special wines were actually pretty damn good and really cheap.

33
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:18,180
Speaker 0: You probably could have saved some money if you went to the state discount liquor store or something.

34
00:02:18,681 --> 00:02:19,205
Speaker 1: It depends.

35
00:02:19,266 --> 00:02:20,919
Speaker 1: I buy my liquor at places like that.

36
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:21,509
Speaker 0: Eh, whatever.

37
00:02:22,684 --> 00:02:23,330
Speaker 1: I tasted the wine.

38
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:23,754
Speaker 1: It was good.

39
00:02:23,774 --> 00:02:24,440
Speaker 1: I got a bunch of spicy wine.

40
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,100
Speaker 0: You were already intoxicated when you tasted that wine.

41
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:27,219
Speaker 0: I wasn't actually.

42
00:02:29,361 --> 00:02:33,540
Speaker 0: They could get you drunk and then they'll give you, like, you know, frickin' hobo wine.

43
00:02:33,701 --> 00:02:34,953
Speaker 1: You'd be like, "Wow, hobo is

44
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:35,459
Speaker 1: awesome!".

45
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,386
Speaker 1: That's the other thing.

46
00:02:36,427 --> 00:02:38,040
Speaker 1: A lot of people don't know how to taste wine.

47
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:40,539
Speaker 1: I mean, when I was tasting the wine, I was spitting it out.

48
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,680
Speaker 1: Because if you actually want to taste wine, if you don't spit it out, you're going to get drunk real quick.

49
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,960
Speaker 1: And then you're not going to be able to tell what tastes good or not.

50
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,840
Speaker 1: You're going to come home with a bunch of hobo wine.

51
00:02:50,862 --> 00:02:53,300
Speaker 0: When I was reading that article about wine counterfeiting...

52
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,159
Speaker 1: Did you read the whole thing?

53
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,220
Speaker 0: I read most of it.

54
00:02:55,281 --> 00:02:56,780
Speaker 1: I skimmed it, but yeah, it was pretty interesting.

55
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,440
Speaker 0: But there was a guy in there who would get these stupidly expensive wines.

56
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,200
Speaker 0: And when he would taste them, he would taste them with a bunch of other people.

57
00:03:03,761 --> 00:03:07,592
Speaker 0: And he would make sure everyone swallows it, because he's like, "I didn't spend the frickin' thousand dollars.

58
00:03:07,612 --> 00:03:08,096
Speaker 0: You just spit it

59
00:03:08,217 --> 00:03:08,338
Speaker 0: out.".

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
Speaker 0: See, for me, that's different.

61
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:16,624
Speaker 0: But then people would bring, like, spittoons and hide them in their laps, because the amount of stuff that they were going to have to drink, they were like, "Oh my god.

62
00:03:17,929 --> 00:03:20,078
Speaker 0: I don't want to get plastered and fall over like a

63
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:20,459
Speaker 0: doofus.".

64
00:03:21,243 --> 00:03:24,099
Speaker 0: But meanwhile, the guy who was doing it, it's like, "Eh, he just drinks it

65
00:03:24,179 --> 00:03:24,260
Speaker 0: all.".

66
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:24,864
Speaker 0: He's like, "Whatever.

67
00:03:24,884 --> 00:03:27,199
Speaker 0: You could probably drink, like, five bottles, that'd be

68
00:03:27,219 --> 00:03:27,300
Speaker 0: fine.".

69
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:29,439
Speaker 1: You know, there was a really good Master Keaton about that.

70
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:31,660
Speaker 0: A guy who could just drink everyone under the table?

71
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,639
Speaker 1: Well, no, there's like this ancient bottle of wine, like the most fat...

72
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:37,997
Speaker 0: Oh, so Master Keaton, it's insured by Mr.

73
00:03:38,017 --> 00:03:38,499
Speaker 0: Keaton.

74
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,920
Speaker 1: Well, in the end, Master Keaton wants to taste it, and he's so nervous.

75
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,730
Speaker 1: He's like, "I don't know if I can deal with this.

76
00:03:45,493 --> 00:03:46,758
Speaker 1: I'm afraid to drink it.

77
00:03:46,778 --> 00:03:47,079
Speaker 1: I don't

78
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:47,200
Speaker 1: know.".

79
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:51,320
Speaker 1: But, so I didn't actually get drunk, just because, meh.

80
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,673
Speaker 1: But, our friend Peter Olson bought something awesome.

81
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:55,978
Speaker 1: Something that is...

82
00:03:56,622 --> 00:03:58,080
Speaker 0: An inflatable flail?

83
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,103
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

84
00:03:59,123 --> 00:04:01,140
Speaker 1: Though he found an emo Viking helmet.

85
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:03,240
Speaker 1: It was a Viking helmet, but the horns pointed down.

86
00:04:03,789 --> 00:04:04,000
Speaker 1: Alright.

87
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:04,983
Speaker 1: But he didn't buy that.

88
00:04:05,043 --> 00:04:09,620
Speaker 1: What he bought was a real, awesome, like, drinking horn.

89
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,880
Speaker 0: A drinking horn?

90
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:11,911
Speaker 1: A drinking horn.

91
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,700
Speaker 1: A real one.

92
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,260
Speaker 0: See, I want to get one of those bags to drink, like, the wine.

93
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:15,983
Speaker 1: They had those.

94
00:04:16,164 --> 00:04:20,000
Speaker 1: They also had the wooden mugs and the leather mugs that you can just strap to your belt.

95
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:21,305
Speaker 0: I don't need the mugs.

96
00:04:21,507 --> 00:04:22,692
Speaker 0: I like the bags.

97
00:04:22,752 --> 00:04:24,480
Speaker 0: They just kind of squeeze it into your mouth.

98
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:25,099
Speaker 1: A wine skin?

99
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:25,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, skin.

100
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:26,699
Speaker 0: That's what it's called.

101
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,070
Speaker 1: But he bought it, and then he went to a beer stand.

102
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,119
Speaker 1: He was like, "Could you rinse this out and fill it with beer for

103
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,220
Speaker 1: me?".

104
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,929
Speaker 1: And they were like, "That's enough beer to kill a man.

105
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,999
Speaker 1: I'm going to give you one glass of beer poured into

106
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:36,079
Speaker 1: it.".

107
00:04:36,643 --> 00:04:39,660
Speaker 1: The thing will hold a whole bottle of wine, even though it doesn't look that big.

108
00:04:40,085 --> 00:04:40,235
Speaker 0: Wow.

109
00:04:40,341 --> 00:04:41,480
Speaker 1: It's quite impressive.

110
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:46,100
Speaker 1: So, we're at the joust, and Peter's drinking from his drinking horn, and we didn't pay attention.

111
00:04:46,221 --> 00:04:47,289
Speaker 1: We just showed up at the joust.

112
00:04:47,309 --> 00:04:48,640
Speaker 1: First to go to the human chest, right?

113
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,460
Speaker 1: Which is Sir Walter Raleigh versus some evil dude.

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,082
Speaker 1: No, no, so whatever.

115
00:04:53,102 --> 00:04:54,065
Speaker 1: It's like a cheesy plot.

116
00:04:54,085 --> 00:04:59,520
Speaker 1: They're fighting, and they're going to fight over the governorship of Ireland and whatever, and then there's some evil going on.

117
00:05:00,081 --> 00:05:00,905
Speaker 1: Then we get to the joust.

118
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,734
Speaker 1: We're like, "All right, this is going to be cheesy and awesome.

119
00:05:02,754 --> 00:05:03,115
Speaker 1: Whatever.".

120
00:05:04,362 --> 00:05:06,900
Speaker 1: And we didn't realize that we sat on the evil side.

121
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:13,840
Speaker 1: You know, it's like one crowd of the crowd is for the good guys, like on the queen side, Queen Elizabeth, and everyone else is on the bad guys' side.

122
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:14,423
Speaker 1: Ah.

123
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:19,999
Speaker 1: So, we're sitting there, and we don't know what to expect, and then when the cultists came out...

124
00:05:20,509 --> 00:05:20,900
Speaker 0: All right.

125
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,792
Speaker 1: Pete and I were like, "Oh, man!

126
00:05:22,872 --> 00:05:23,799
Speaker 1: God!".

127
00:05:24,101 --> 00:05:31,800
Speaker 1: We got more into it because I didn't expect cultists and sacrifice and evil plots to summon a demon knight to kill everyone and take the throne.

128
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,366
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

129
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:39,017
Speaker 1: And then, you know, when the cultists come out, right, they start playing all this music, and I think to myself, "Wait a minute.

130
00:05:39,298 --> 00:05:39,559
Speaker 1: Wait a

131
00:05:39,579 --> 00:05:39,800
Speaker 1: minute.".

132
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:40,700
Speaker 0: Are they playing Slayer?

133
00:05:41,101 --> 00:05:41,782
Speaker 1: "Wait a minute.

134
00:05:42,122 --> 00:05:44,046
Speaker 1: This sounds familiar, these

135
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:44,547
Speaker 1: lyrics.".

136
00:05:44,707 --> 00:05:50,357
Speaker 1: And I turn to Pete, and he turns to me, "Archangel, Darkangel, lend me thy light.

137
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:51,138
Speaker 1: Not

138
00:05:51,178 --> 00:05:51,439
Speaker 1: here.".

139
00:05:52,201 --> 00:05:53,039
Speaker 0: Not here, yep.

140
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:59,480
Speaker 1: And then they played some other Cradle of Filth song, and they played some... It was unexpectedly awesome.

141
00:05:59,782 --> 00:05:59,967
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

142
00:06:00,801 --> 00:06:02,120
Speaker 1: And in the end, the good guys won.

143
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:02,604
Speaker 1: Boo.

144
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:05,648
Speaker 1: But the thing is, it played out really well.

145
00:06:05,709 --> 00:06:09,100
Speaker 1: I expect a yo cheesy whatever when the time came to pull the evil.

146
00:06:09,642 --> 00:06:13,419
Speaker 1: The cultists just fucking rush everyone with swords and start killing them, like straight up.

147
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:14,030
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

148
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,600
Speaker 1: So, uh, then we leave.

149
00:06:15,641 --> 00:06:16,580
Speaker 0: At least they died honorably.

150
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:25,500
Speaker 1: So then we leave, and we're on, you know, we get our wine, and we're on the road home, and we stop at a gas station to get some Red Bulls and pee and all that, you know, go to the pee station and all that business.

151
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:26,500
Speaker 0: The pee station?

152
00:06:27,006 --> 00:06:28,520
Speaker 0: And I see... What did that pee station smell like?

153
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:29,438
Speaker 1: Smelled like pee.

154
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:36,860
Speaker 1: Uh... So from a distance, I see one of the cultists from the Ren Faire going in, you know, someone dressed in, like, all these black robes.

155
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,315
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Aw, man, it's one of the

156
00:06:38,355 --> 00:06:38,779
Speaker 1: cultists.".

157
00:06:40,021 --> 00:06:43,594
Speaker 1: Once we got in, it turned out that it was actually unrelated to the Renaissance Faire.

158
00:06:43,634 --> 00:06:45,180
Speaker 1: It was just a Muslim woman in a burqa.

159
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:50,133
Speaker 1: And I'm so glad I didn't go and be like, "Man, you were awesome.

160
00:06:50,334 --> 00:06:52,099
Speaker 1: I was totally on your side right up to the

161
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:52,360
Speaker 1: end.".

162
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,480
Speaker 1: Yeah.

163
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:53,808
Speaker 1: Yeah.

164
00:06:56,485 --> 00:06:57,919
Speaker 1: But the Renaissance Faire was worth it.

165
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,400
Speaker 0: Yeah.

166
00:06:59,223 --> 00:06:59,819
Speaker 1: That's all I got?

167
00:07:00,161 --> 00:07:01,019
Speaker 0: No, that's not all you got.

168
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,240
Speaker 1: Well, it's not all I got?

169
00:07:02,442 --> 00:07:02,960
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

170
00:07:03,201 --> 00:07:03,879
Speaker 1: What else do I got?

171
00:07:04,100 --> 00:07:05,612
Speaker 0: Something that's actually related to Monday.

172
00:07:05,632 --> 00:07:06,600
Speaker 0: I guess somewhat.

173
00:07:07,188 --> 00:07:08,040
Speaker 1: Oh, I got a new job.

174
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:08,410
Speaker 0: Yeah.

175
00:07:08,783 --> 00:07:09,458
Speaker 1: I got a new job.

176
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:09,987
Speaker 0: Yay.

177
00:07:10,862 --> 00:07:12,920
Speaker 0: Now you have to stop complaining about your shit job.

178
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:21,460
Speaker 1: Honestly, I don't think you're ever going to hear me talk about my job again, because my new job is, like, more awesome than I could have expected.

179
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,400
Speaker 0: If you ever complain about it, you won't hear the end of it from me.

180
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:25,103
Speaker 1: No, you won't.

181
00:07:25,163 --> 00:07:28,280
Speaker 1: You won't hear the end of it from me, because I'm excited about this job.

182
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:32,657
Speaker 1: For the first time since I left college, I'm excited about a job.

183
00:07:32,717 --> 00:07:33,320
Speaker 1: Think about that.

184
00:07:33,641 --> 00:07:34,886
Speaker 1: I'm excited about work.

185
00:07:34,927 --> 00:07:37,959
Speaker 1: About a nine to, well, a seven to four job.

186
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:39,118
Speaker 0: Great job.

187
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,268
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm all up in this business.

188
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:42,394
Speaker 1: I'm up in this grill.

189
00:07:42,414 --> 00:07:43,420
Speaker 1: This job is my parliament.

190
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:44,760
Speaker 0: So, news.

191
00:07:45,101 --> 00:07:45,163
Speaker 1: So?

192
00:07:45,452 --> 00:07:45,700
Speaker 1: News?

193
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,766
Speaker 0: Yeah, we missed two weeks of news here.

194
00:07:47,786 --> 00:07:52,200
Speaker 0: There's a lot of stuff to catch up on, but that means since I'm only picking one, I gotta pick the big one.

195
00:07:52,884 --> 00:07:53,899
Speaker 1: Whoa, what's the big one?

196
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:59,335
Speaker 0: Obviously, it's all about some monkeys of a variety.

197
00:07:59,355 --> 00:08:00,980
Speaker 0: The Gibbon variety, I think.

198
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,498
Speaker 0: Gutsy Gibbon.

199
00:08:03,254 --> 00:08:03,540
Speaker 0: It's out.

200
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,523
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we got a lot to say, surprisingly.

201
00:08:07,385 --> 00:08:08,426
Speaker 1: Not because of Gutsy Gibbon.

202
00:08:08,466 --> 00:08:17,960
Speaker 1: Gutsy Gibbon's fine, but people are really excited about Gutsy Gibbon, but for reasons that aren't quite what they perhaps should be excited about.

203
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:28,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, basically what's going on here, right, is the tech, the word on the tech news beat is that, "Oh, people are disappointed with Vista, so everyone's going to the Gutsy Gibbons, oh

204
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:28,940
Speaker 0: man.".

205
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:36,832
Speaker 1: You go to any blog that talks about Linux distros, and they're always like, "Gutsy Gibbon is like a leap forward for Linux.

206
00:08:36,892 --> 00:08:40,477
Speaker 1: This is like Linux on the desktop, all the way, everything's great.

207
00:08:40,517 --> 00:08:41,799
Speaker 1: This is like the second coming of

208
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,179
Speaker 1: Jesus.".

209
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:48,052
Speaker 0: There are all these tech journalists who are like, "I tried Linux and Ubuntu many, many times, but this is finally the one.

210
00:08:48,112 --> 00:08:49,234
Speaker 0: that's the business.

211
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:51,498
Speaker 0: Oh man, all the other ones sucked, but this is the first one.

212
00:08:51,518 --> 00:08:51,979
Speaker 0: that's the real

213
00:08:52,019 --> 00:08:52,240
Speaker 0: deal.".

214
00:08:52,340 --> 00:09:04,900
Speaker 1: So, Scott, I mean, Gutsy Gibbon obviously is the second or third coming of Jesus Christ our savior, so what did they, I mean, do they have like a new kernel memory management thing that just blows us away?

215
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:07,372
Speaker 0: Well, it does have the 2622 kernel instead of the 2620 kernel.

216
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:09,960
Speaker 0: Thank fucking God!

217
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:15,680
Speaker 0: Of Feisty Fawn, which is a vast improvement, especially if you are using a laptop or something.

218
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:18,459
Speaker 1: A laptop or a lot of new 8-bit motherboards.

219
00:09:18,942 --> 00:09:19,479
Speaker 0: Well, I guess.

220
00:09:20,382 --> 00:09:23,240
Speaker 1: From what I read, it looks like my motherboard will actually work with this kernel.

221
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:23,549
Speaker 0: Maybe.

222
00:09:24,101 --> 00:09:26,639
Speaker 1: I can turn my turning 8-bit off back on.

223
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:34,100
Speaker 0: Secondly, it has a new thing for printing, so now, like, if you've ever not been able to get your printer to work in Linux, your troubles are over.

224
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:40,340
Speaker 0: Like, even, I know a lot of people, they couldn't get their printer to work in Windows either, just because setting up a printer is kind of, you know, hard for most people.

225
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:47,120
Speaker 0: Well, I think the reason for that- If you've ever had trouble setting up a printer, I think it's easier to set up a printer in Gutsy Gibbon than in any other OS ever.

226
00:09:47,261 --> 00:09:51,238
Speaker 1: Well, the thing with Windows printers, because I can get this out of the way real quick, is that- They suck?

227
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:57,900
Speaker 1: Well, no, it's that the context in setting up a printer in Windows can fool you in one specific time.

228
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:10,418
Speaker 1: If you have a printer that has its own NIC, or like, its own IP address out there, or it's a server that serves a printer as though it's just a standalone printer, like, directly printing to an IP address, you think, "Yeah, network printer.

229
00:10:10,478 --> 00:10:11,399
Speaker 1: I want to set up a network

230
00:10:11,439 --> 00:10:11,680
Speaker 1: printer.".

231
00:10:12,261 --> 00:10:12,581
Speaker 1: No.

232
00:10:12,962 --> 00:10:18,596
Speaker 1: You have to set up a local printer, and then under local printer, choose TCP/IP local port.

233
00:10:19,378 --> 00:10:21,119
Speaker 0: Now, that- I've never seen that.

234
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,657
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you want to print directly to an IP printer, you have to set up a local IP port.

235
00:10:25,878 --> 00:10:31,202
Speaker 0: If you try to- It's what I used to just type in a URL, like, using, like, IPP cups, I would type in, like- Because that's different.

236
00:10:31,222 --> 00:10:32,645
Speaker 1: That's not direct IP printing.

237
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:33,427
Speaker 1: That's mitigate.

238
00:10:33,447 --> 00:10:38,880
Speaker 1: That's, like, moderated printing through- It might be an embedded server, but that's different from embedded direct printing.

239
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:39,518
Speaker 0: Whatever.

240
00:10:40,043 --> 00:10:42,094
Speaker 1: Yeah, but a lot of printers do that.

241
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:43,100
Speaker 1: A lot of people have trouble with that.

242
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,421
Speaker 0: You know what?

243
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:51,000
Speaker 0: If you have a network printer, and you're on the network, and the network printer is working, and you're using Ubuntu, you can click search for network printers, and they'll all show up.

244
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:56,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, now, I'm glad- that's a problem that should have been solved, like, ten years ago in computing.

245
00:10:57,342 --> 00:10:57,988
Speaker 0: Alright, let's see.

246
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,180
Speaker 0: What else is different?

247
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,569
Speaker 1: But are there any, like, great leaps forward?

248
00:11:01,609 --> 00:11:03,620
Speaker 1: Why is this the best Linux to ever come out?

249
00:11:04,382 --> 00:11:05,204
Speaker 0: I don't know.

250
00:11:05,906 --> 00:11:06,888
Speaker 0: What else did they change?

251
00:11:06,949 --> 00:11:11,119
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a little easier to configure your, uh, X, like-.

252
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:19,680
Speaker 0: This is the first time where I didn't have to actually edit the Xorg.conf to make stuff work, even with two monitors, or using my laptop with a strange resolution, so that's a bonus.

253
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:32,900
Speaker 0: However, because I'm using Nvidia, I had to do some weird combination of using the new Ubuntu, uh, graphical configuration thing, and the Nvidia graphical configuration thing, until I got it just right with my two monitor deal.

254
00:11:33,045 --> 00:11:33,319
Speaker 0: Yeah.

255
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:38,480
Speaker 0: But, if you ignore the Nvidia stuff, you can just do it straight with the Ubuntu, and it should work, I guess, okay.

256
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,360
Speaker 1: So what's the revolution of Gutsy Gibbon?

257
00:11:41,642 --> 00:11:43,627
Speaker 0: Uh, what else did they change?

258
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:48,800
Speaker 0: Oh, sound support is worse than it was in the previous, uh, Ubuntu.

259
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:51,418
Speaker 0: But it was worse in Feisty than it was in- what?

260
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:51,679
Speaker 0: Ugh.

261
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,260
Speaker 0: Basically, they got the same sound configuration dialogue, right?

262
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,520
Speaker 1: Oh, the one that doesn't do anything?

263
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:02,159
Speaker 0: Right, so I changed all- in Feisty, I was able to change all the options to say, "Hey, use the optical output of my sound

264
00:12:02,199 --> 00:12:02,420
Speaker 0: card.".

265
00:12:02,761 --> 00:12:08,260
Speaker 0: I did the same thing in Gutsy, didn't work, I had to manually configure using the Alsa configuration file.

266
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:15,600
Speaker 1: And you might all remember my Feisty problems, trying to get anything to work, that's why I'm using Jack right now, but that's partly ReSound's fault.

267
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,940
Speaker 0: ReSound's, uh, the ReSound package for Ubuntu still crashes when you try to record, and you still need to use Jack.

268
00:12:21,882 --> 00:12:26,360
Speaker 1: Granted, I don't mind using Jack, because Jack is actually- A little better technically somewhere?

269
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:33,100
Speaker 1: It's more robust, it seems, in that I have not- never had a problem with any process causing my audio to skip.

270
00:12:34,282 --> 00:12:34,342
Speaker 0: Mhm.

271
00:12:34,362 --> 00:12:35,546
Speaker 0: Oh, right, obviously.

272
00:12:35,726 --> 00:12:40,780
Speaker 0: The, uh, the one change is they added the Compiz Fusions by default.

273
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:54,700
Speaker 1: So, now what does this say about Linux journalism, in that the Linux that gets, like, more attention than any Linux ever, like, this is Linux, this is the best thing ever, it is now perfect, is that they added some iCandy.

274
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:02,340
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically, if you install Gutsy Given, there's three options, no iCandy, normal iCandy, and super iCandy.

275
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:10,980
Speaker 0: And no- regular iCandy is the default, as long as you have some sort of 3D card that your- that Linux is, you know, supports.

276
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:16,120
Speaker 0: It's like, I have an Intel card on my laptop, it just set normal by default, and it worked.

277
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:23,080
Speaker 0: I had an Nvidia on my desktop, which means after I installed the Nvidia driver, which is, like, one click, uh, it starts working.

278
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:27,894
Speaker 0: And if you're using an ATI card, I guess it's also one click to set up the ATI stuff now.

279
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:29,740
Speaker 0: At least I think so, I don't know, actually, no.

280
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:31,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't even really used Gutsy yet, so.

281
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:38,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the basic iCandy is just, you know, drop shadows, little window animations, changing desktops makes a little slidey effect.

282
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:43,140
Speaker 1: See, I like stuff like that, it doesn't get in your way, as long as it- die actually doesn't get in your way.

283
00:13:43,220 --> 00:13:50,900
Speaker 0: My personal philosophy on iCandy is, I want to make my computer easier to use, and I wanna use my computer more efficiently.

284
00:13:51,301 --> 00:13:54,360
Speaker 0: So, if it helps me use the computer more efficiently, I want it.

285
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:59,840
Speaker 0: If it looks good, and doesn't hurt my ability to use my computer efficiently, sure, why not.

286
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:05,580
Speaker 0: But if it in any way makes it harder for me to use the computer, I don't care how pretty it is, get it out of my face.

287
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:07,691
Speaker 0: Like, those wobbly windows, fuck 'em.

288
00:14:07,731 --> 00:14:09,460
Speaker 0: They're just fucking me around, and it's bullshit.

289
00:14:10,441 --> 00:14:17,700
Speaker 0: So yeah, basically, the only real substantial change, other than printing and stuff, to this latest Ubuntu, is iCandy.

290
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:26,630
Speaker 0: And suddenly, everyone, after all these years of having these true, rightful complaints about, you know, Linux, they'd be like, "Oh, I can't use Linux, it doesn't support this.

291
00:14:26,711 --> 00:14:27,797
Speaker 0: Oh, I can't use Linux, it doesn't support

292
00:14:27,837 --> 00:14:27,958
Speaker 0: that.".

293
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:32,760
Speaker 0: They, for years and years and years, people had these legitimate complaints about why they weren't using Linux, right?

294
00:14:33,382 --> 00:14:36,380
Speaker 0: And most of those complaints are still perfectly valid.

295
00:14:37,021 --> 00:14:40,858
Speaker 0: But suddenly, they forgot all those, because now there's iCandy, and they're going, "Woo, Linux, second

296
00:14:40,898 --> 00:14:41,220
Speaker 0: coming!".

297
00:14:41,561 --> 00:14:45,598
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Wow, wow, journalistic integrity right out the

298
00:14:45,638 --> 00:14:45,919
Speaker 0: window.".

299
00:14:46,301 --> 00:14:50,100
Speaker 0: And I'm the Linux user, who's been using it when it was shitty and still is shitty.

300
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,540
Speaker 1: I just find it kind of hilarious, to be honest.

301
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:59,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't get it, but it shows that people, all they really care about is iCandy, hence the Apple fanboyism, you know?

302
00:15:00,061 --> 00:15:00,603
Speaker 0: "Oh, it's so much

303
00:15:00,683 --> 00:15:00,804
Speaker 0: easier.".

304
00:15:00,864 --> 00:15:14,979
Speaker 0: No, it's just iCandy messing with the psychology, or I don't know what the fuck it is, but they've proved to me once and for all, I now firmly believe that people, most people, really just care about iCandy, and technology is just an excuse they use.

305
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:24,720
Speaker 1: So, in other big news, I feel like I'm almost obligated to talk about this, but Radiohead, you might have heard of them, they're a somewhat popular band, I hear.

306
00:15:24,941 --> 00:15:26,480
Speaker 0: I know they're a rock band.

307
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:31,120
Speaker 0: Weren't they in that, were they the band from The Scott Teneman Must Die, or is that another band?

308
00:15:32,162 --> 00:15:32,880
Speaker 0: You know, I don't remember.

309
00:15:33,205 --> 00:15:33,958
Speaker 0: I think it might have been.

310
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,838
Speaker 1: Uh, yeah, I think it was.

311
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,367
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:15:36,532 --> 00:15:36,697
Speaker 0: Anyway.

313
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,158
Speaker 0: Okay, so now I kinda little know more about who they are.

314
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:54,440
Speaker 1: Radiohead, if you aren't aware, released their new album titled In Rainbows online by themselves, and they had their servers up and everything, and they basically released it with the idea that you can pay however much you wanna pay.

315
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,378
Speaker 0: Can I pay zero?

316
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:56,546
Speaker 1: Yes, you can.

317
00:15:56,586 --> 00:15:58,380
Speaker 1: If you wanna pay zero, you can pay zero.

318
00:15:58,680 --> 00:15:58,895
Speaker 1: Alright.

319
00:15:59,061 --> 00:16:02,000
Speaker 1: We're just gonna put it up there, no DRM, no nothing.

320
00:16:02,361 --> 00:16:06,180
Speaker 1: Just, you're gonna download straight up, unencumbered files to do with as you please.

321
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:18,600
Speaker 1: And, uh, a lot of people went in a lot of directions about, you know, oh, they're gonna, everyone's just gonna hit zero, or one guy's gonna get it for zero, and then it's just gonna be all over the torrent, so they're not gonna make any money, blah blah blah blah blah blah.

322
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:39,840
Speaker 1: They didn't really say, like, they didn't wanna release how many sales they actually get, or what people are actually saying, but there's a lot of rumors about what the information was, and guesses seem to be that one to two thirds of people paid zero, but there's an article here stating that it is believed that they made between six and ten million dollars.

323
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:43,309
Speaker 0: It's possible, I mean, for every person.

324
00:16:43,349 --> 00:16:46,880
Speaker 0: that's, you know, most people are just gonna pay zero, or like a dollar, or something like that, right?

325
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:52,497
Speaker 0: It's like a long tail, but there's very few people who are like, "I love Radiohead, here's a thousand

326
00:16:52,538 --> 00:16:52,939
Speaker 0: dollars!".

327
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,784
Speaker 0: You know, 'cause it's like finally a chan-.

328
00:16:54,824 --> 00:17:09,156
Speaker 0: I mean, 'cause, like, think about it, back in the day, you know, remember people would download MP3s and peer-to-peer networks, and then, like, send checks to the artist to say, you know, "I don't wanna buy your CDs 'cause I hate the record company, but here's some money for you, the artist, 'cause I know if I buy the CD, you're gonna get, like, five cents, but here's ten

329
00:17:09,176 --> 00:17:09,459
Speaker 0: bucks.".

330
00:17:09,922 --> 00:17:12,560
Speaker 0: And those checks all came back, 'cause, like, we can't accept your money.

331
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:20,898
Speaker 0: Now, here's a chance for people to actually give money directly to the artist and no one else, so some people are gonna give a lot of money, and most people are just gonna get their MP3s.

332
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,839
Speaker 1: Plus, I mean, I can think of bands where I'd give 'em a few bucks.

333
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'll give, you know- Buck and I supremacy?

334
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:27,858
Speaker 0: I'd give them some bucks.

335
00:17:28,220 --> 00:17:33,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, but, I mean, we don't really know exactly how successful this was from a monetary perspective.

336
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:41,440
Speaker 1: What we do know is that the album was downloaded crazily, absolutely batshit crazily by a lot of people.

337
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:43,039
Speaker 0: That's a good PR move right there.

338
00:17:43,481 --> 00:17:44,439
Speaker 1: And, see, I think that's it.

339
00:17:45,281 --> 00:17:54,638
Speaker 1: In the next couple years, I think we're gonna see a few more, you know, every now and then some big name is gonna buck the trend and say, "All right, we're doing it the way you geeks want it, let's see what

340
00:17:54,678 --> 00:17:55,119
Speaker 1: happens.".

341
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,283
Speaker 0: I mean, think about it this way, right?

342
00:17:57,524 --> 00:18:03,080
Speaker 0: Radiohead, not even on my radar, I didn't even know who they were, just barely anything, right?

343
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,705
Speaker 0: Now, they did this.

344
00:18:05,467 --> 00:18:09,339
Speaker 0: Odds are, I'm gonna at least listen to their music once to be like, "Oh, that's who they

345
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:09,480
Speaker 0: are.".

346
00:18:12,141 --> 00:18:14,472
Speaker 0: Because they did this, they got someone to listen to their music.

347
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:15,376
Speaker 0: Huge.

348
00:18:15,577 --> 00:18:16,180
Speaker 0: That's huge.

349
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,385
Speaker 1: Now, plus, think of this from another perspective.

350
00:18:18,425 --> 00:18:23,800
Speaker 1: Say you're a little struggling indie band and you just put your music up in the same kind of deal.

351
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:24,872
Speaker 1: Like, "Hey, download our

352
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:24,953
Speaker 1: MP3s.".

353
00:18:25,581 --> 00:18:27,120
Speaker 0: Not gonna get as much play as Radiohead.

354
00:18:27,380 --> 00:18:32,000
Speaker 1: But while you're not, I almost feel like the future of music is gonna be in this long tail.

355
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:41,340
Speaker 1: And at that point, getting yourself known, especially if you don't have to pay anyone to get you known, you don't have to pay a marketing machine, to take your face and put it on billboards.

356
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:48,560
Speaker 0: No, but what Radiohead did have to do is, first of all, they had the "pre" being known by getting their face on billboards, which helped a lot.

357
00:18:48,700 --> 00:19:04,300
Speaker 0: And second of all, this latest move, while they didn't, I guess, at least as far as I know, it wasn't advertised on television or anywhere like billboards and such, it was put in newspapers and websites and blogs of everyone going, "Oh man, Radiohead is giving away their music for free.

358
00:19:04,742 --> 00:19:06,717
Speaker 0: You're just a musician, no one's gonna talk about

359
00:19:06,757 --> 00:19:06,797
Speaker 0: it.".

360
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,752
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is, some people will, because this is the big scale.

361
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:14,820
Speaker 1: Make the little microcosm, the little tiny analogy example.

362
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,700
Speaker 1: The little indie band will do it and get talked about on the little indie band blogs.

363
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:23,499
Speaker 1: It'll be like this tiny little storm of publicity within the realm of that kind of music.

364
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:31,933
Speaker 0: Until this becomes a commonplace practice, which it actually is among many indie bands, so no one will talk about it, because it's like saying, "Someone came out with a new CD.

365
00:19:31,994 --> 00:19:32,216
Speaker 0: Oh my

366
00:19:32,236 --> 00:19:32,438
Speaker 0: god.".

367
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:33,350
Speaker 0: Well, no, not "Oh my

368
00:19:33,371 --> 00:19:33,431
Speaker 0: god."

369
00:19:33,452 --> 00:19:34,019
Speaker 0: It happens every day.

370
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:35,571
Speaker 1: See, you kind of jumped my point.

371
00:19:35,592 --> 00:19:36,479
Speaker 1: That's what I was getting to.

372
00:19:36,921 --> 00:19:43,500
Speaker 1: This, in my opinion, is not a revolution in music distribution or bands making money or anything like that.

373
00:19:44,020 --> 00:20:00,720
Speaker 1: I think that this is just one stepping stone on the way to a future that is basically going to be the long tail of a whole bunch of bands competing in the effectively free market space and ones that are good eventually filtering to the top purely on their own merit and making money from live shows and merchandise.

374
00:20:01,161 --> 00:20:10,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean even the really big people today, I mean I heard some numbers from places that Madonna made less than $20 million on some albums.

375
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:10,574
Speaker 0: Oh no!

376
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,080
Speaker 0: But she made like $600 million from concerts and stuff.

377
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:15,108
Speaker 1: But remember, there are different kinds of artists.

378
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,160
Speaker 1: Madonna definitely does those stadium concerts.

379
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,620
Speaker 1: A million people come and you do a whole bunch in a row.

380
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,089
Speaker 0: And those are my favorite kinds, I would not mind.

381
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:25,660
Speaker 0: Not Madonna specifically, but stadium awesomeness.

382
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:31,980
Speaker 1: I don't know, my favorite kind of concert is the smaller, more intense- The stadium places.

383
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,180
Speaker 1: I don't know, I really like the up close and personal like little scummy jazz band somewhere.

384
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:46,640
Speaker 1: But I think the important thing about this is that this radio-ed thing, even if it's not like the end all, like this is not how music is going to be distributed, and eventually this sort of thing is just going to be commonplace.

385
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,175
Speaker 0: Eventually music, you will just think in your mind and then music will appear.

386
00:20:50,196 --> 00:20:51,100
Speaker 0: Oh wait, you can do that already.

387
00:20:51,360 --> 00:21:01,659
Speaker 1: But what I think is that this is going to be a turning point in that the media, the mainstream media, not the geeky media, but the real world like, "Today in Iraq a bomb blew

388
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:01,880
Speaker 1: off.".

389
00:21:02,102 --> 00:21:03,500
Speaker 0: Old school crap media.

390
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,919
Speaker 1: You know, like the guy on CNN.

391
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:17,858
Speaker 1: I think those people are talking about this as, "Wow, this band bucked a trend and did something weird, and they're going to make a bunch of money, and this is going to turn the record industry up on its

392
00:21:17,878 --> 00:21:18,079
Speaker 1: head.".

393
00:21:18,682 --> 00:21:26,217
Speaker 1: I think financial types might see this and it'll put that seed into their heads of, "Maybe we should invest in alternative distribution of music or

394
00:21:26,258 --> 00:21:26,580
Speaker 1: something.".

395
00:21:26,948 --> 00:21:27,340
Speaker 0: Eh, whatever.

396
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:38,360
Speaker 1: I feel like if nothing else, this put into the consciousness of the previous few generations that maybe the record industry is not going to be the way it's always been in the future.

397
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:46,240
Speaker 0: I think the interesting story that I saw people talking about was how even though they're doing this, a lot of people are still downloading the stuff from peer-to-peer networks.

398
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,140
Speaker 1: Well, I think the reason for that is that peer-to-peer is still easier.

399
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,967
Speaker 0: Well, it's not that it's just easier.

400
00:21:51,008 --> 00:22:03,253
Speaker 0: I think the thing is that I realized recently is that a whole generation or two of people from us on down have grown up and the way that they know to get music is peer-to-peer networks.

401
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:03,900
Speaker 0: That's what they learn.

402
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:04,923
Speaker 0: It's like, "How do you get music?

403
00:22:05,164 --> 00:22:06,268
Speaker 0: A peer-to-peer network.

404
00:22:06,669 --> 00:22:09,018
Speaker 0: Use LimeWire, use Nutella, use Kazaa, use

405
00:22:09,038 --> 00:22:09,359
Speaker 0: whatever.".

406
00:22:09,681 --> 00:22:11,620
Speaker 0: That's the way they know to get music.

407
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,418
Speaker 0: So if there's ever a time to get music, they don't even know, "Go to a website, use your iTunes, Wi-Fi,

408
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:17,880
Speaker 0: whatever.".

409
00:22:18,223 --> 00:22:20,400
Speaker 0: They know, "Go to a peer-to-peer network and get

410
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:20,460
Speaker 0: it.".

411
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:33,440
Speaker 0: That's how they know and that's what they're going to do and continue doing until they learn something else, if someone changes their learning, which is incredibly difficult because you can see people like my parents, they grew up learning how to get music was to buy an album.

412
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:37,575
Speaker 0: And even though they know, I tell them, "Just frickin' don't do that.

413
00:22:37,595 --> 00:22:38,157
Speaker 0: You're wasting your

414
00:22:38,197 --> 00:22:38,378
Speaker 0: money.".

415
00:22:38,961 --> 00:22:41,500
Speaker 0: They do it anyway because that's what they learned and it's incredibly difficult.

416
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,500
Speaker 1: Are you sure they don't do it because they don't want to be a pirate or steal?

417
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,358
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

418
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:45,765
Speaker 0: Ah.

419
00:22:47,021 --> 00:22:48,668
Speaker 0: Because they just don't unlearn.

420
00:22:48,728 --> 00:22:49,551
Speaker 0: People don't unlearn.

421
00:22:49,772 --> 00:22:50,676
Speaker 0: They don't learn new things.

422
00:22:50,696 --> 00:22:51,640
Speaker 0: They stick with what they know.

423
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,122
Speaker 1: See, I don't know.

424
00:22:52,142 --> 00:23:01,300
Speaker 1: I could definitely see people making the argument that they don't do that sort of thing just because they don't want to be a sub-media pirate or they feel like they're stealing and they don't want to do it.

425
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,724
Speaker 0: But they don't even go and buy.

426
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:07,460
Speaker 0: They could save money by just buying non-DRM tracks on iTunes, which is non-DRM tracks now.

427
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:07,939
Speaker 1: Not many.

428
00:23:08,601 --> 00:23:11,535
Speaker 0: No, every track on iTunes is now non-DRM for a dollar.

429
00:23:11,575 --> 00:23:12,620
Speaker 0: Yes, they changed it recently.

430
00:23:13,382 --> 00:23:16,200
Speaker 1: But non-DRM, is it MP3 or is it still some other format?

431
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,920
Speaker 0: Well, it's AACs, but you're listening on an iPod and you could burn a CD.

432
00:23:20,462 --> 00:23:21,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, not everyone has an iPod.

433
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you could burn a CD and you could convert.

434
00:23:25,201 --> 00:23:27,700
Speaker 1: I'm just never happy because a dollar is just way too much.

435
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:31,820
Speaker 0: A dollar is just way too much for me as well, but it's still cheaper than a frickin' CD at the store.

436
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:34,389
Speaker 0: But anyway, yes, that's the point.

437
00:23:35,014 --> 00:23:35,779
Speaker 0: People don't unlearn.

438
00:23:42,641 --> 00:23:43,900
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

439
00:23:44,582 --> 00:23:56,980
Speaker 1: So Emily showed me this the other day and partly because we've been on the other side of this for a long time, this is someone's blog post on eight ways to drive a graphic designer mad.

440
00:23:58,121 --> 00:23:59,479
Speaker 1: And it's kind of really...

441
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:00,971
Speaker 0: Hey, can you make something for me?

442
00:24:00,991 --> 00:24:02,060
Speaker 0: Something cool-looking.

443
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:07,440
Speaker 1: When you send a graphic designer a document, make sure it's made with a program from the Microsoft Office Suite.

444
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:17,520
Speaker 1: If you have to send pictures, you'll have more success in driving them mad if instead of sending a JPEG or a raw camera file, you embed the pictures inside of a Microsoft Office document like Word or PowerPoint.

445
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,692
Speaker 1: Don't forget to lower the resolution to 72 DPI.

446
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:24,956
Speaker 1: When you send them a higher version later, make sure the size is at least 50% smaller.

447
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:27,260
Speaker 1: Awesome.

448
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:37,680
Speaker 1: Because honestly, I've had that happen to me a lot where someone will have to send me a screenshot or a picture and they just put it in a Word document and then send me the Word document.

449
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,720
Speaker 1: And on the other token, we've been on the side where we need art.

450
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,731
Speaker 1: So we talk to an artist and we say, "Make us

451
00:24:45,852 --> 00:24:45,993
Speaker 1: art.".

452
00:24:46,073 --> 00:24:46,878
Speaker 1: And they say, "What do you

453
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:47,120
Speaker 1: want?".

454
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:48,766
Speaker 1: And I say, "I don't know.

455
00:24:49,148 --> 00:24:49,991
Speaker 1: Make it arty.

456
00:24:50,092 --> 00:24:51,317
Speaker 1: Make it look like something

457
00:24:51,377 --> 00:24:51,698
Speaker 1: good.".

458
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,152
Speaker 0: I mean, this is sort of the thing where it's like.

459
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:58,700
Speaker 0: I encountered this problem with people when I'm trying to help them with their computers.

460
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:03,120
Speaker 0: And I recognize that they can't tell me what the problem is.

461
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:06,360
Speaker 0: They're incapable of doing it because they lack the vocabulary.

462
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:09,100
Speaker 0: They lack the understanding of the computer.

463
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:10,727
Speaker 0: They can't tell me what's wrong with it.

464
00:25:10,787 --> 00:25:13,120
Speaker 0: I need to pretty much go and investigate it myself.

465
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,937
Speaker 0: This is why you don't call a mechanic and say, "Yeah, my car is making a chugga-chugga-chugga

466
00:25:16,957 --> 00:25:17,219
Speaker 0: noise.".

467
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:22,140
Speaker 0: You freaking take it to the mechanic and let him look at it because that's the only way he's going to be able to figure anything out.

468
00:25:22,420 --> 00:25:32,560
Speaker 0: So with a graphic designer, it's much more difficult because they're not trying to fix something that's broken and you lack the vocabulary to tell them, but they can still figure it out by looking at the broken thing themselves.

469
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:37,860
Speaker 0: They need to know what you want and you still lack the vocabulary.

470
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:40,260
Speaker 0: So it's incredibly difficult to communicate.

471
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,262
Speaker 1: And I can just imagine, well, I know how it is because Emily tells me all the time how frustrating it is to have to

472
00:25:47,285 --> 00:25:47,746
Speaker 0: create

473
00:25:48,187 --> 00:25:56,337
Speaker 1: something creative for someone who is unable to tell you what they want and the only thing they can really say is, "No, that's not

474
00:25:56,478 --> 00:25:56,518
Speaker 1: it.".

475
00:25:58,184 --> 00:26:06,219
Speaker 0: All you can really do is just keep making stuff and try to, you know, figure out, you know, sort of inch your way closer to kind of what they want, you know.

476
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:08,219
Speaker 1: Well, from my perspective and what I've learned...

477
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:13,700
Speaker 0: You have to do a lot more work than you'd have to do if they were able to accurately express their desires.

478
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:18,920
Speaker 1: Actually, I think the problem is a lot of people try to have too much influence over their creative people.

479
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,333
Speaker 0: That is a problem.

480
00:26:20,373 --> 00:26:21,019
Speaker 1: that also happens.

481
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,326
Speaker 1: Once we said, "Fuck it.

482
00:26:22,728 --> 00:26:23,372
Speaker 1: You're an artist.

483
00:26:23,613 --> 00:26:24,297
Speaker 1: Make us something.

484
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:24,739
Speaker 1: We'll use

485
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:24,840
Speaker 1: it.".

486
00:26:25,061 --> 00:26:26,689
Speaker 1: And very quickly we got something.

487
00:26:26,729 --> 00:26:29,000
Speaker 1: and once we just said, "We're gonna trust that person's judgment.

488
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,517
Speaker 1: Otherwise, why are we going to pay

489
00:26:30,577 --> 00:26:30,699
Speaker 1: them?".

490
00:26:31,365 --> 00:26:33,200
Speaker 1: We got something really good almost right away.

491
00:26:33,681 --> 00:26:36,159
Speaker 1: And it wasn't what we pictured originally, but you know what?

492
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,405
Speaker 0: We're not artists.

493
00:26:37,465 --> 00:26:38,714
Speaker 0: We're not gonna picture something good.

494
00:26:38,754 --> 00:26:39,660
Speaker 0: That's why we want artists.

495
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,916
Speaker 1: If I could picture something good...

496
00:26:41,361 --> 00:26:44,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, if I could picture something good, I wouldn't need the artist, would I?

497
00:26:45,461 --> 00:26:45,743
Speaker 0: Alright.

498
00:26:46,308 --> 00:26:47,900
Speaker 0: My thing of the day is just one photo.

499
00:26:48,442 --> 00:26:49,560
Speaker 0: It's a photo of a trailer.

500
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:52,658
Speaker 0: And in front of this trailer, there are two signs.

501
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,740
Speaker 0: Well, there's three signs, but two of them are redundant.

502
00:26:55,460 --> 00:26:57,434
Speaker 0: One of the signs says, "Computer

503
00:26:57,474 --> 00:26:57,796
Speaker 0: repair."

504
00:26:58,421 --> 00:26:59,629
Speaker 0: And one of the signs says,

505
00:27:00,172 --> 00:27:00,756
Speaker 0: "Tomatoes."

506
00:27:01,681 --> 00:27:06,520
Speaker 0: And I could see that being my sort of retirement there.

507
00:27:07,763 --> 00:27:11,555
Speaker 1: It's funny how we're so... I mean, you heard our Thursday show and the questions.

508
00:27:11,575 --> 00:27:12,180
Speaker 1: We're ambitious.

509
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:20,380
Speaker 1: And we're constantly fighting for more and striving for more and making more money and doing more podcasts and becoming big and famous and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah and take over the world.

510
00:27:21,123 --> 00:27:29,917
Speaker 1: And yet at the same time, we both almost envy the life of, you know, "Have a little house out in the middle of nowhere and tend to the

511
00:27:29,958 --> 00:27:30,339
Speaker 1: cattle.".

512
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:35,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is like the Zen of Scott is a trailer that says, "Computer repair,

513
00:27:35,577 --> 00:27:36,078
Speaker 0: tomatoes.".

514
00:27:36,702 --> 00:27:37,659
Speaker 1: I can almost say that that...

515
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,336
Speaker 0: "Grow my tomatoes, fix

516
00:27:39,356 --> 00:27:39,720
Speaker 0: computers.".

517
00:27:39,901 --> 00:27:41,124
Speaker 1: That might be my perfect light.

518
00:27:41,145 --> 00:27:45,920
Speaker 1: It's like if I could have a little computer repair shot and, I don't know, a little podcast.

519
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,297
Speaker 0: Yeah, just...

520
00:27:48,262 --> 00:27:51,060
Speaker 1: Plus, Scott really likes growing tomatoes and he grows pretty good tomatoes.

521
00:27:52,103 --> 00:27:54,596
Speaker 0: It's not up to you whether the tomatoes you grow are good or not.

522
00:27:54,617 --> 00:27:55,280
Speaker 0: It's up to the plant.

523
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Speaker 1: It's up to you to a degree.

524
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:01,140
Speaker 0: All you do is you take a dirt-to-tomato converting machine and you put it in the dirt.

525
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,920
Speaker 1: No, because you have to make sure the machine is well oiled.

526
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:06,153
Speaker 1: I mean, what if the tomatoes start turning black?

527
00:28:06,173 --> 00:28:07,280
Speaker 1: You gotta give them some calcium.

528
00:28:08,845 --> 00:28:10,760
Speaker 0: If that starts happening, you screwed up already.

529
00:28:12,722 --> 00:28:14,090
Speaker 0: It's either gonna work or it's not.

530
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,760
Speaker 0: You just put the pieces together and you wait.

531
00:28:16,103 --> 00:28:17,112
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like a...

532
00:28:18,361 --> 00:28:27,480
Speaker 1: Right, so we did last week, questions week, and of course we have another four to five hours of questions week to use as filler whenever we go out of town in the near future.

533
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,240
Speaker 0: Some of it already recorded, some of it not.

534
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:34,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, partly because I was tired and lazy and Scott was also kind of tired and lazy.

535
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:41,940
Speaker 0: Yep, but during the questions week, we got some questions that had such long answers to them, we could just use them as episode ideas instead of questions.

536
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:45,900
Speaker 0: So let's start that up because we didn't have a lot of episode ideas coming up.

537
00:28:46,380 --> 00:28:48,468
Speaker 1: So someone asked us, "What do you

538
00:28:48,508 --> 00:28:48,689
Speaker 1: do?".

539
00:28:48,709 --> 00:28:51,138
Speaker 1: I mean, you're obviously technology guys, you know the business.

540
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:55,320
Speaker 1: "When you make a brand new computer and you install Windows on

541
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:55,380
Speaker 1: it.".

542
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,120
Speaker 1: But we're gonna expand that to pretty much any operating system.

543
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're gonna do Windows, Linux, and OS X.

544
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:02,252
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we'll do those three.

545
00:29:02,696 --> 00:29:03,200
Speaker 1: In that order.

546
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:04,700
Speaker 0: For a desktop, not for a server.

547
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,812
Speaker 1: Got a new computer, it's your home desktop, yours.

548
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,660
Speaker 1: Not someone else's, not for your mom, but yours.

549
00:29:11,441 --> 00:29:11,943
Speaker 1: Alright, it's new.

550
00:29:12,244 --> 00:29:13,648
Speaker 1: I've got the Windows CD.

551
00:29:14,249 --> 00:29:16,094
Speaker 1: In what order, like what do you do?

552
00:29:16,616 --> 00:29:17,378
Speaker 1: What things do you do?

553
00:29:17,398 --> 00:29:18,080
Speaker 1: What's the order you do?

554
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:21,434
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when you move into a new house, like what do you unpack first?

555
00:29:21,896 --> 00:29:22,920
Speaker 1: The answer is the computer.

556
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,420
Speaker 0: Okay, well first let's say the things that are true for all the operating systems, right?

557
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,480
Speaker 0: The first thing is I get all the available updates, no matter what.

558
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:33,340
Speaker 1: To the BIOS.

559
00:29:34,401 --> 00:29:36,271
Speaker 0: Okay, the BIOS, but the operating system.

560
00:29:36,292 --> 00:29:37,820
Speaker 0: We're talking about after you install the operating system.

561
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:40,180
Speaker 1: Alright, so I install Windows, I go to Windows Update.

562
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:42,066
Speaker 0: Yep, I install Linux, I go to the update.

563
00:29:42,186 --> 00:29:42,949
Speaker 0: OS X, update.

564
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:44,675
Speaker 0: I update everything I can update.

565
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:46,140
Speaker 0: All the way to the maximum.

566
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,820
Speaker 1: Now, not like special drives, only the things that the operating system gives you.

567
00:29:49,940 --> 00:29:56,940
Speaker 1: Like, for Windows, the first thing I do is go to Windows Update, install everything, reboot, install everything, reboot until there's nothing left to install.

568
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:00,060
Speaker 1: That my Windows is the most up-to-date it can be.

569
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:01,420
Speaker 0: Yep, default Windows.

570
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,733
Speaker 1: Now, I don't even install video card drivers or anything at this point.

571
00:30:05,773 --> 00:30:08,220
Speaker 1: Just the bare minimum to boot Windows.

572
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:14,120
Speaker 0: And the next thing is the video card driver, which you don't need to install on OS X, but you do need to install on Linux.

573
00:30:14,160 --> 00:30:17,493
Speaker 1: The only exception is if you have a motherboard that requires motherboard drivers.

574
00:30:18,015 --> 00:30:19,360
Speaker 1: I will often do that before I do the...

575
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,559
Speaker 0: That's not really applicable anymore because if you...

576
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:26,814
Speaker 1: My current motherboard did not work properly in Windows XP.

577
00:30:27,055 --> 00:30:28,980
Speaker 1: The USB didn't work for shit.

578
00:30:29,565 --> 00:30:31,179
Speaker 0: Even after updating the XP all the way?

579
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, USB didn't work for crap.

580
00:30:33,345 --> 00:30:36,754
Speaker 1: The hard drives were kind of okay, but not all the controllers worked.

581
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:38,800
Speaker 1: The ethernet kind of worked, but not really.

582
00:30:39,601 --> 00:30:42,840
Speaker 1: So, I actually then installed the motherboard drivers.

583
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,628
Speaker 0: That's weird.

584
00:30:44,849 --> 00:30:46,478
Speaker 0: That's like a thing of the past, but I guess...

585
00:30:47,326 --> 00:30:48,340
Speaker 1: It depends on the motherboard.

586
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:54,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you want to install your video card drivers so you can set proper resolutions and get your 3Ds on and all that stuff.

587
00:30:54,721 --> 00:30:59,700
Speaker 0: Even if you have just some sort of integrated video card, you're either going to have an Nvidia or an ATI, most likely.

588
00:31:00,222 --> 00:31:03,180
Speaker 0: And they have a driver, even if it's like the shittiest card in the universe.

589
00:31:03,341 --> 00:31:09,100
Speaker 0: And you need that driver to get the stuff to actually work better than the default Windows driver is going to do you for.

590
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,143
Speaker 0: Okay, so next.

591
00:31:11,906 --> 00:31:21,840
Speaker 0: Because, nowadays... Back in the day, you'd actually have to install... I remember, even in 2000, 2001, if I had a fresh operating system, I had to install a lot of applications.

592
00:31:22,001 --> 00:31:23,044
Speaker 0: A whole mess of them.

593
00:31:23,085 --> 00:31:25,433
Speaker 0: Because everything was desktop applications.

594
00:31:25,473 --> 00:31:27,280
Speaker 0: And now, everything is web applications.

595
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:30,774
Speaker 0: I use Gmail, so I don't have to install any email clients.

596
00:31:30,834 --> 00:31:32,080
Speaker 0: I use Google Calendar.

597
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:33,346
Speaker 0: I don't have to install any calendar stuff.

598
00:31:33,386 --> 00:31:34,170
Speaker 0: I use Google Docs.

599
00:31:34,211 --> 00:31:35,880
Speaker 0: I don't even need OpenOffice anymore, really.

600
00:31:36,541 --> 00:31:38,599
Speaker 0: But, can't use any of those things without...

601
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,384
Speaker 1: Plus, games.

602
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:42,120
Speaker 1: I used to have to install all my games.

603
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,680
Speaker 0: Now you just install Steam, right?

604
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:46,780
Speaker 0: And on the other operating system, you're not playing games.

605
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,032
Speaker 1: So, I'll say straight up, this is the exact order.

606
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:50,460
Speaker 1: I installed things at a new computer.

607
00:31:50,581 --> 00:31:54,080
Speaker 1: It's Firefox, and then I'll make sure Firefox is updated.

608
00:31:54,342 --> 00:31:56,259
Speaker 0: Then an IM client, depending on OS.

609
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,440
Speaker 1: Actually, now, I don't do that anymore.

610
00:31:58,661 --> 00:31:59,059
Speaker 0: Oh, really?

611
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:06,180
Speaker 1: Now, I just go and get all my Firefox extensions, and then I just use Gmail and the embedded things.

612
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,360
Speaker 1: I don't chat so much anymore.

613
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:15,420
Speaker 0: The embedded thing is okay when I need it, but I use the same Google Chat with the domains thing.

614
00:32:15,983 --> 00:32:17,620
Speaker 0: But, I use CoPete on Linux.

615
00:32:17,962 --> 00:32:20,460
Speaker 1: I'd use ADM if I could, because ADM is like the best thing ever.

616
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:21,124
Speaker 1: I don't know.

617
00:32:21,204 --> 00:32:21,749
Speaker 1: I don't care.

618
00:32:21,769 --> 00:32:22,394
Speaker 1: It's the duck.

619
00:32:22,555 --> 00:32:23,200
Speaker 1: The green duck.

620
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:27,200
Speaker 0: The duck, but the duck is only on OS X. You can't get the duck on the other operating systems.

621
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,208
Speaker 0: And in Windows, I actually can't.

622
00:32:29,288 --> 00:32:31,440
Speaker 0: There's no more good IM client for Windows.

623
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:37,298
Speaker 0: I mean, there's Pidgin, formerly known as GAIM, but it's not really as good as CoPete or ADM.

624
00:32:38,445 --> 00:32:39,080
Speaker 0: It's kind of crummy.

625
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:43,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, and part of that, too, is I chat when I'm away from home.

626
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,540
Speaker 1: When I'm at home, I'm usually too busy to chat, except on weekends.

627
00:32:46,843 --> 00:32:48,640
Speaker 1: I don't chat the way I used to.

628
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:53,540
Speaker 1: I use forums and kind of time-shifted communication instead of real-time communication.

629
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:54,900
Speaker 0: Do you want to go through?

630
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:58,640
Speaker 0: I know we did a whole show on Firefox extensions, but I'm sure it's changed since that time.

631
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,800
Speaker 0: Do you want to just list the ones you used?

632
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:04,740
Speaker 1: I installed something to put things in Delicious, which is pretty much just for Geek Nights.

633
00:33:04,940 --> 00:33:07,480
Speaker 0: I used the Delicious tag, like the buttons.

634
00:33:07,641 --> 00:33:10,860
Speaker 0: Not the full Delicious extension, just the regular, the one that adds two buttons.

635
00:33:11,101 --> 00:33:12,819
Speaker 1: I install Adblock and the Filterset G.

636
00:33:13,201 --> 00:33:16,760
Speaker 0: I use Adblock Plus, which comes with its own Filterset subscription stuff.

637
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:17,637
Speaker 0: I don't need the Filterset G.

638
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,725
Speaker 1: Yeah, it doesn't matter.

639
00:33:18,786 --> 00:33:20,560
Speaker 1: Sometimes I do it manually, but the key is Adblock.

640
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:21,479
Speaker 0: Adblock Plus.

641
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,240
Speaker 1: And beyond that, I don't use much.

642
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,120
Speaker 1: I install Farkit because I am still a Farker, tried and true.

643
00:33:28,501 --> 00:33:35,040
Speaker 0: I install Google Browser Sync, which is what I use to keep my bookmarks synchronized between my desktop, my work computer, and my laptop.

644
00:33:35,220 --> 00:33:38,800
Speaker 1: If I had a laptop, I would also do that, but because I do not have a laptop, I don't bother.

645
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:39,819
Speaker 0: What about your home and your work?

646
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:41,609
Speaker 1: I work, I don't bookmark things.

647
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:45,375
Speaker 1: The only thing I go to at work is, I mean, I don't read webcomics or anything there.

648
00:33:45,416 --> 00:33:45,900
Speaker 1: I do it at home.

649
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:48,220
Speaker 1: The only thing I do at work is, you know, check my email.

650
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,239
Speaker 0: I check all my sites and all my places.

651
00:33:51,021 --> 00:33:51,484
Speaker 1: I just don't.

652
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:53,540
Speaker 1: I have an RSS feed that I look at the titles for.

653
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,978
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm looking at my Google Reader at work.

654
00:33:55,260 --> 00:34:03,660
Speaker 1: Plus, to be perfectly honest, my new job, I don't think I'm going to be just surfing around the internet because I think I'm going to be doing fun work, like actually enjoyable work.

655
00:34:05,122 --> 00:34:09,860
Speaker 0: Then I install Firebug and Web Developer Toolbar, which are for developing web stuff.

656
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,840
Speaker 0: So if you're not web developing, you don't need that shit.

657
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:17,753
Speaker 1: Yeah, I installed that when I was, like, that kind of stuff at RIT, but I don't do web development anymore.

658
00:34:18,054 --> 00:34:18,900
Speaker 1: That's kind of Scott's job.

659
00:34:19,280 --> 00:34:22,440
Speaker 0: If you're JavaScripting and CSSing and HTMLing, you need that shit.

660
00:34:22,601 --> 00:34:23,619
Speaker 0: Otherwise, you don't need that shit.

661
00:34:23,920 --> 00:34:27,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, that is now Scott's job in the Geek Nights family.

662
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:28,280
Speaker 1: I work on other things.

663
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,938
Speaker 0: So, other than that, what else do we install here?

664
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,848
Speaker 1: Pretty much nothing anymore.

665
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,815
Speaker 1: I just, I mean, I install Steam.

666
00:34:36,058 --> 00:34:36,600
Speaker 1: I get it going.

667
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,447
Speaker 0: Oh, I got to install the Flash plugin.

668
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:41,020
Speaker 0: I got to install Acrobat Reader, you know.

669
00:34:41,260 --> 00:34:44,699
Speaker 0: And for all those people who are like, they use some other PDF reader, that's fine.

670
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:48,659
Speaker 0: I still actually like Acrobat Reader, especially the newest versions, actually not bad.

671
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,708
Speaker 1: You know why I didn't think of those?

672
00:34:49,728 --> 00:34:57,244
Speaker 1: For all that stuff, to be honest, I don't even think about them until I go to a website or I download a PDF and it's like, "You can't look at

673
00:34:57,285 --> 00:34:57,425
Speaker 1: this.".

674
00:34:57,466 --> 00:34:57,908
Speaker 1: I'm like,

675
00:34:57,928 --> 00:34:57,969
Speaker 1: "Oh.".

676
00:34:58,130 --> 00:34:59,840
Speaker 1: And then I install it because it takes a second.

677
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:03,000
Speaker 1: After all that, I install Winamp.

678
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:04,920
Speaker 0: I don't use Winamp.

679
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,967
Speaker 1: Or if I use iTunes, iTunes.

680
00:35:07,047 --> 00:35:13,607
Speaker 1: Because in Windows, one, I don't listen to music in Windows anymore, but if I did, I'll install Winamp.

681
00:35:13,948 --> 00:35:20,106
Speaker 1: But nowadays, since all my music is in Linux on a riser partition by itself, I just, I don't even bother.

682
00:35:20,127 --> 00:35:21,211
Speaker 1: I don't even have Winamp.

683
00:35:21,271 --> 00:35:26,440
Speaker 1: I have no way to play MP3s except the Windows Media Player, which doesn't matter because I'm only in Windows to play Steam games.

684
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, in Windows, I have iTunes.

685
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:28,589
Speaker 0: I don't really use it.

686
00:35:28,609 --> 00:35:31,220
Speaker 0: I use the iTunes downstairs, but that's only for podcasting.

687
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:33,488
Speaker 0: In Linux, I use Amaroq for my stuff.

688
00:35:33,529 --> 00:35:38,299
Speaker 0: And the thing is, I use all these KDE applications like Amaroq and Copete, but I don't use KDE.

689
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:41,660
Speaker 1: In Linux, I use Win- uh, yeah, not WinMX.

690
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:42,665
Speaker 1: XMMS?

691
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:43,391
Speaker 1: XMMS.

692
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:44,649
Speaker 0: You can use Audacious.

693
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:45,480
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

694
00:35:45,861 --> 00:35:47,009
Speaker 1: XMMS is kind of shitty.

695
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,440
Speaker 1: I just use it because I don't care.

696
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:55,280
Speaker 0: Use Audacious or something, you know, what's the other- you could use like Beat Media Player, VMPX, I guess it's called now.

697
00:35:55,581 --> 00:36:00,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just haven't bothered because I listen to most of my music on my iPod and not in my room anymore.

698
00:36:00,360 --> 00:36:00,460
Speaker 0: Yep.

699
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:06,920
Speaker 0: I also install New Cash, which is available for Windows and Linux to manage my finances, which I store on a thumb drive.

700
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,063
Speaker 1: I might start doing that.

701
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:17,037
Speaker 1: The only reason I didn't is that it's always been my philosophy, once I had money, was that I will spend all the money that I'm going to spend and get everything that I want.

702
00:36:17,097 --> 00:36:17,760
Speaker 1: that is reasonable.

703
00:36:18,061 --> 00:36:18,658
Speaker 0: I still do that.

704
00:36:19,031 --> 00:36:19,200
Speaker 0: Yeah.

705
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:20,238
Speaker 0: I just keep track of it.

706
00:36:20,762 --> 00:36:24,900
Speaker 1: And as long as I know that I- I mean, I just- if I ran out of money, that means something's wrong.

707
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,720
Speaker 1: And I don't run out of money, so nothing's wrong.

708
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:32,179
Speaker 1: It's not like- to keep track of my money would never have made me say, "Maybe I should spend less

709
00:36:32,219 --> 00:36:32,460
Speaker 1: money.".

710
00:36:32,580 --> 00:36:37,947
Speaker 0: No, I don't look at the- my finances or accounting and make decisions like, "Oh, I should spend less money.

711
00:36:37,968 --> 00:36:38,692
Speaker 0: I'm spending too much

712
00:36:38,733 --> 00:36:38,974
Speaker 0: already.".

713
00:36:38,995 --> 00:36:39,800
Speaker 0: I don't even think about it.

714
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,170
Speaker 0: I just keep track.

715
00:36:41,653 --> 00:36:41,995
Speaker 0: That's all.

716
00:36:42,015 --> 00:36:42,660
Speaker 0: I just keep track.

717
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,444
Speaker 1: Yeah, I used to.

718
00:36:43,545 --> 00:36:45,300
Speaker 1: Now that I make a lot of money, I probably will again.

719
00:36:45,580 --> 00:36:45,701
Speaker 1: Yeah.

720
00:36:46,143 --> 00:36:49,340
Speaker 0: Plus I can go and see like how close my student loans are to being paid off.

721
00:36:49,461 --> 00:36:50,246
Speaker 1: Well, see, that's the thing.

722
00:36:50,307 --> 00:36:52,160
Speaker 1: I have no debt, really, anymore.

723
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,680
Speaker 0: But, you know, keep track of my credit card.

724
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,560
Speaker 1: My credit card just paid off every month.

725
00:36:56,721 --> 00:36:57,570
Speaker 0: I know, mine is too.

726
00:36:57,732 --> 00:36:58,460
Speaker 0: But I just keep track.

727
00:36:59,721 --> 00:37:12,820
Speaker 0: I also use numeric, because what happens- if you try to open up like a spreadsheet and it tries to open up in OpenOffice, OpenOffice is slow to open, even on like my solid state hard drive laptop, even on my dual core at work, right?

728
00:37:13,361 --> 00:37:17,140
Speaker 0: So I use numeric, which is a spreadsheet that opens faster and is better.

729
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:20,720
Speaker 1: But yeah, honestly, in Windows, that's pretty much it.

730
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,560
Speaker 0: Oh wait, no, in Windows, there are two other things I install.

731
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:28,376
Speaker 0: I install Putty and WinSCP so that I can SSH and SCP.

732
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,820
Speaker 1: I often will install Launchy if I'm going to use the computer a lot.

733
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:34,479
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, if I'm using the computer, I'll use Launchy.

734
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:37,060
Speaker 1: And Sigmund, because I want to have just a thing.

735
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,605
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm tired of Sigmund.

736
00:37:38,906 --> 00:37:43,000
Speaker 0: WinSCP and Putty are enough for me, because I just SSH to another machine and use that.

737
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,320
Speaker 0: Screw the Sigmund, which is all cool.

738
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:47,511
Speaker 1: Well, I use Sigmund mostly for other stuff, like just writing bash scripts.

739
00:37:47,552 --> 00:37:49,860
Speaker 1: if I happen to be in Windows and I need to write a bash script for something.

740
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:51,900
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess.

741
00:37:52,180 --> 00:37:56,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, and when I was learning Python, I just installed Python in Sigmund and was using that.

742
00:37:57,662 --> 00:38:00,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't even need Sigmund to learn Python in Windows.

743
00:38:00,861 --> 00:38:02,879
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had Sigmund anyway.

744
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,559
Speaker 1: Obviously, I don't have any real important- like there's no other applications that matter to me.

745
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:10,079
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's the point, is that back in the day, right?

746
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:17,779
Speaker 1: You'd be installing your WinMs, and your WinZips, and- I'd go to all the shareware sites and get, like, all the little utilities I used.

747
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:25,680
Speaker 0: I'd be getting, like, different video players and audio players, and I'd have to install, like, six or seven different plugins instead of just MPlayer.

748
00:38:26,340 --> 00:38:31,740
Speaker 0: You know, I'd have to go and install, like, RealPlayer, QuickTime, Windows Media Player, Flash, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

749
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:46,300
Speaker 0: A million things all over the place, and now, the desktop matters less and less and less, and this is why- This is what has allowed Linux and Mac to sorta come up on Windows, is 'cause Windows is the king, because your desktop applications really mattered.

750
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:51,460
Speaker 0: And that's what you used most of the time, and they ran on Windows, and that was it, and you used another operating system.

751
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,740
Speaker 0: You didn't have desktop applications, you had nothing.

752
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,408
Speaker 0: Now, it's all web applications.

753
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,540
Speaker 0: Doesn't matter what the hell you use, it's got a web browser, you're good to go.

754
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,377
Speaker 0: I mean, you could use a Wii.

755
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:07,980
Speaker 0: If I was stuck with just the Wii, it would suck, 'cause the interface is kinda, but I could live, I could do all my stuff with just the Wii.

756
00:39:08,605 --> 00:39:10,239
Speaker 0: Plus, now that it has USB keyboard support.

757
00:39:10,901 --> 00:39:17,160
Speaker 1: So, Linux is kind of a slightly different world because of package repositories in terms of what I install.

758
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:18,359
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, I guess.

759
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:22,220
Speaker 1: I mean, and also the fact that there aren't usually as many updates.

760
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:25,420
Speaker 0: Uh, I guess it's just that you do the updates once, like, whoosh.

761
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:32,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it just works, I don't worry about it, but after I update a Linux box, I install my podcast crap, but that's just 'cause I'm a podcaster, you guys can ignore that.

762
00:39:33,942 --> 00:39:35,339
Speaker 1: I don't install a lot.

763
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:42,560
Speaker 1: I kinda, it's kind of like, on the Linux box, when I make a new one, I spend most of my time configuring my desktop.

764
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,840
Speaker 1: 'Cause Windows, you know, you get something.

765
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:48,060
Speaker 1: In Linux, I move stuff around, I make it, like, my perfect desktop, and I spend a lot of time.

766
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:53,000
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I spend a lot, I go through every single preferences option, I make sure I go to the Firefox preferences, you know.

767
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,400
Speaker 0: But I make sure to set everything, 'cause the defaults are not what I want.

768
00:39:56,440 --> 00:40:10,800
Speaker 1: But in Windows, other than making every window list all, like list, and I get rid of all that sidebar crap, and I make it don't hide system files, don't hide hidden files, don't hide extensions from me, and all that.

769
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:16,180
Speaker 1: Other than that, I don't fiddle with the Windows much, but Linux, I fiddle with everything for, like, four hours.

770
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,158
Speaker 0: Maybe not for four hours, but...

771
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:24,440
Speaker 1: I fiddle and fiddle and fiddle and I make everything perfect, and then, I really just install applications on an as-needed basis.

772
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,538
Speaker 1: Like, I'm sitting there, and I think, "I wanna do X. Oh, I don't have

773
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:27,679
Speaker 1: X.".

774
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:31,497
Speaker 1: A lot of times, with the new Linux box, I'll type a command, and it won't go, and I'll be like,

775
00:40:31,678 --> 00:40:31,759
Speaker 1: "Oh.".

776
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,400
Speaker 0: There's actually a cool feature that came in, in Feisty, again.

777
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:41,480
Speaker 0: If, let's say, you have a new Linux box, right, it doesn't have Vim, and, well, I guess it does have basic Vim, but it doesn't have, like, gVim, right?

778
00:40:42,081 --> 00:40:44,600
Speaker 0: And, you need, if you wanna have real Vim, you gotta install it.

779
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,060
Speaker 0: So, let's say you got a new Feisty fresh install, you type gVim.

780
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:52,500
Speaker 0: It'll say, "Yeah, we don't got gVim installed, type this to install

781
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:52,560
Speaker 0: it.".

782
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:53,778
Speaker 1: That's hot.

783
00:40:53,980 --> 00:41:03,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could type in, like, any command, and, if it's a command, it's real, and it knows about this command, but the package you need to actually run that command is not installed, it'll tell you.

784
00:41:03,660 --> 00:41:06,940
Speaker 0: Like, if you type "lame," like, here, let me do it right now in my gutsy, here, in my laptop.

785
00:41:07,585 --> 00:41:07,733
Speaker 0: "Lame.".

786
00:41:07,961 --> 00:41:09,840
Speaker 0: The program "lame" is currently not installed.

787
00:41:09,940 --> 00:41:13,016
Speaker 0: You can install it by typing, "sudo apt-get install

788
00:41:13,056 --> 00:41:13,338
Speaker 0: lame.".

789
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:23,640
Speaker 1: Now, think, I mean, just the ramifications of this, that, kind of this on-demand application installation, coupled with the desktop thing, I don't even think about what applications I use.

790
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:29,878
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not even, like, Windows, where, "Oh, I need an application, go out, search the web, find an EXE

791
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:30,299
Speaker 0: somewhere.".

792
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:36,058
Speaker 0: It's just, "Type this, and the program will be installed, and let's see how long it takes,

793
00:41:36,078 --> 00:41:36,259
Speaker 0: here.".

794
00:41:37,260 --> 00:41:45,920
Speaker 1: And thus, we can get into OS X, which is even a different ballgame, 'cause I turn it on, and it's got almost everything I need.

795
00:41:46,402 --> 00:41:48,220
Speaker 0: Except a lot of this stuff is kinda crummy.

796
00:41:48,685 --> 00:41:48,920
Speaker 1: Yeah.

797
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,099
Speaker 0: At least the iLife stuff.

798
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:58,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, we're not, like, graphic designers, we don't use all the Photoshop-y things, so, the Mac just does all the basic stuff automatically.

799
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,100
Speaker 1: I mean, I go install Firefox, and I go and, you know, the same kind of thing I do with Windows.

800
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:10,040
Speaker 1: I install Firefox, I install the Duck, I install Chicken of the VNC, 'cause that's the best icon of any open-source program in the history of the world.

801
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,819
Speaker 0: I also, I install the X-Type VNC viewer on anything that doesn't allow Chicken of the VNC.

802
00:42:15,261 --> 00:42:16,298
Speaker 1: Ah, Chicken of the VNC.

803
00:42:17,964 --> 00:42:19,180
Speaker 0: It's just, it's so great.

804
00:42:19,341 --> 00:42:20,038
Speaker 0: It is pretty great.

805
00:42:20,944 --> 00:42:21,839
Speaker 0: Uh, what else is there?

806
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:22,661
Speaker 1: I don't know.

807
00:42:23,043 --> 00:42:28,140
Speaker 1: Other than that, it's weird, OS X, despite being, you know, kinda Linux-based.

808
00:42:28,802 --> 00:42:29,453
Speaker 0: Unix-based.

809
00:42:29,514 --> 00:42:29,840
Speaker 0: It's Unix.

810
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:35,280
Speaker 1: I do it the same way I do Windows, where I go out and get applications and install them.

811
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

812
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:43,180
Speaker 0: Like, I go to a- You can go out, get, and install Fink, and then use Fink to install things, you know, in the Unix style.

813
00:42:43,661 --> 00:42:51,320
Speaker 0: But a lot of those things are sorta, they work sorta behind the scenes, down in like the, it's weird, OS X feels like it has this dark underworld to it.

814
00:42:51,380 --> 00:42:54,039
Speaker 0: It's like, on the surface, it's the shiny, easy-to-use OS.

815
00:42:55,000 --> 00:43:01,480
Speaker 0: It doesn't give you all the options of a power OS like Windows or Linux, but, you know, it does everything most normal people need to do.

816
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:08,280
Speaker 0: And for anyone who's not a power user, it's beyond awesome for them, because it keeps everything they don't care about out of their way, and it works.

817
00:43:08,923 --> 00:43:12,820
Speaker 0: But if you, you can actually get down to business with it, but it's all hidden, down under.

818
00:43:13,060 --> 00:43:36,040
Speaker 0: Like, you start getting in with Fink, you got these terminals opening up, and you got this, this X Windows thing going, and it's starting to do all this weird undercover stuff, and things start to get funky, and it's- That's the part I don't like, because I need to do that stuff, and it sorta gets in my way, because it does sorta treat that stuff as like a second-class citizen to the, I guess, the shiny front stuff.

819
00:43:36,381 --> 00:43:40,040
Speaker 0: So, that's, in Linux, you know, everything is an equal citizen, in a way.

820
00:43:40,620 --> 00:43:52,220
Speaker 0: And it's a smooth experience, no matter what application you're using, you know, it's not like, "Yeah, you got this weird X Window thing coming, you gotta configure separately, and, yeah, you know, this guy, this application starts that application, and...".

821
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,300
Speaker 0: You know, how much trouble did we have trying to get that challenge run, fire the thing to work on the Mac?

822
00:43:56,942 --> 00:43:59,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it looked so good once we got it to run.

823
00:43:59,921 --> 00:44:10,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I realized what, doing that, you know, why things on the Mac look so good, and it's because if you just write an application, just, you know, just a bleh application that pops a window up, right?

824
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,028
Speaker 0: The libraries on OS X are actually written to make it look nice.

825
00:44:16,088 --> 00:44:23,820
Speaker 0: The individual programmers who write applications don't have to do anything extra to make stuff look good in the Apple way, and that's why everything looks awesome.

826
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:38,580
Speaker 0: Because stuff by default, like, you could take an application that's, you know, ready to run on every OS, like a cross-platform app, run it on Windows, run Linux, run on OS X, on OS X it looks great, because it just, you know, the command that says "Open Window" on Linux just opens a window.

827
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:43,140
Speaker 0: On OS X it, like, fades in a window with the right decorations on it and everything.

828
00:44:43,140 --> 00:44:50,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, to the point that now when we do shows, we actually bring the Mac with us, because it's just, it's a better displayer of things than any laptop we own.

829
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,219
Speaker 0: Bus is really small.

830
00:44:51,661 --> 00:44:52,082
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

831
00:44:52,142 --> 00:44:59,676
Speaker 1: And especially, it's actually smaller and easier to deal with than a laptop, because we don't need a screen for it, we're gonna plug it into a projector.

832
00:44:59,717 --> 00:45:01,460
Speaker 1: We just plop it down, plug it in, turn it on.

833
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,433
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is the mouse and keyboard action for it.

834
00:45:03,453 --> 00:45:04,420
Speaker 0: We solved the keyboard part.

835
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:06,480
Speaker 1: Yeah, now we just have to solve the mouse problem.

836
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,220
Speaker 1: We need just a nice Bluetooth mouse.

837
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,920
Speaker 0: But the only one that they have for Mac is that Mighty Mouse, which sucks.

838
00:45:13,303 --> 00:45:13,389
Speaker 1: Yeah.

839
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:16,315
Speaker 0: So I need a Bluetooth mouse that'll work with a Mac.

840
00:45:16,335 --> 00:45:17,200
Speaker 0: that's not the Mighty Mouse.

841
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:30,940
Speaker 1: But, see, this question would have been a lot more relevant, I don't know, five years ago than it is now, because now I almost feel like, for a techie, what I do with the process of setting up a new computer has gotten easier and easier and easier.

842
00:45:31,640 --> 00:45:39,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's sort of gotten less meaningful, in a way, 'cause, like, that's, like, I can just, I reinstalled, when Gutsy came out, I did fresh installs.

843
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:46,280
Speaker 0: I mean, back in the day, if you did a fresh install of Windows, that meant you were gonna have to spend a couple days before you were back, you know, up to full efficiency.

844
00:45:46,362 --> 00:45:46,445
Speaker 0: Yep.

845
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:50,320
Speaker 0: I'm at full efficiency with a fresh install of frickin' any Linux.

846
00:45:50,660 --> 00:45:53,100
Speaker 0: Like, even Dapper Drake, I'm at full efficiency.

847
00:45:53,380 --> 00:45:54,540
Speaker 0: You know, it doesn't really matter.

848
00:45:54,760 --> 00:46:02,500
Speaker 1: And even Windows, I'm there right away, because the only things I need to download or get are pretty much things like Steam and drivers.

849
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:04,240
Speaker 1: I mean, I already use OpenOffice.

850
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,317
Speaker 0: Yeah, I installed Firefox.

851
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:06,580
Speaker 0: Good to go, I'm done.

852
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:10,901
Speaker 0: Any machine, any computer with Firefox on it, I'm at 100%.

853
00:46:10,901 --> 00:46:15,140
Speaker 0: I mean, I can do some tweaks here and there to make it a little bit better, which I do on all my machines.

854
00:46:15,201 --> 00:46:17,419
Speaker 1: Firefox is effectively our operating system.

855
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:23,339
Speaker 0: Effectively, I mean, there were people thinking about making, you know, just disks, you would just boot, and it's Firefox, and that's it.

856
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:26,980
Speaker 0: And I don't, that's such a bad idea, especially not in the future.

857
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:27,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're getting there.

858
00:46:28,120 --> 00:46:28,558
Speaker 0: We're getting there.

859
00:46:29,242 --> 00:46:30,620
Speaker 0: Alright, is there anything else to say here?

860
00:46:30,822 --> 00:46:31,538
Speaker 1: I don't know, I think that's it.

861
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:37,680
Speaker 1: We went long every night last week, so I don't feel bad about not going long tonight, and I'm getting kinda hungry.

862
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,120
Speaker 0: Good, let's go eat and watch stuff.

863
00:46:45,550 --> 00:46:47,690
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

864
00:46:47,870 --> 00:46:50,290
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music.

865
00:46:51,011 --> 00:47:02,190
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at www.frontroadcrew.com, where you'll find show notes, links, our awesome forum, a link to our Frapper map, and links to all the RSS feeds.

866
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:08,430
Speaker 1: We say feeds plural because Geek Nights airs four nights a week, covering four different brands of geekery.

867
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:10,618
Speaker 1: Mondays are science and technology.

868
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:13,130
