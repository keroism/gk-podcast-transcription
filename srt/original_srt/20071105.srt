48
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,342
Speaker 0: I like the because it takes skill to keep hitting those goombas in just the right pattern whatever Any anything else thing?

00:02:40,847 --> 00:02:46,269
Speaker 0: Oh, no Let's just get right into it because we've been going along actually a lot lately and we're pushing the lips in to the max.

55
00:03:09,352 --> 00:03:17,686
Speaker 0: There's this article here on slash dot and there are similar articles in every, you know Copycat crap blog everywhere about how cell phone jamming is on the rise.

56
00:03:17,706 --> 00:03:18,850
Speaker 0: now people are buying these.

57
00:03:19,505 --> 00:03:29,030
Speaker 0: You know They're so frustrated with people who just yap on their cell phone in public places or in movies or in stores or on trains or In subways that they're buying these portable devices that jam cell phones.

58
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:33,967
Speaker 0: Now aside from the fact that one that's illegal - it's stupid.

59
00:03:33,987 --> 00:03:36,215
Speaker 0: three Just deal with it.

60
00:03:36,637 --> 00:03:40,510
Speaker 0: or four go to places where they have policies that just say you can't use a cell phone.

61
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:41,382
Speaker 0: They kick anyone out.

62
00:03:41,402 --> 00:03:41,808
Speaker 0: who does?

63
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:44,559
Speaker 0: but I'm what I'm gonna talk about.

64
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:53,290
Speaker 0: it's not so much that technology, but the fact that Funny how all these articles suddenly appeared and how oh, there's actually products that are kind of associated with this.

65
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:54,634
Speaker 0: This is once again.

66
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:58,366
Speaker 0: I if I am not mistaken an example of a fake market.

67
00:03:58,386 --> 00:04:01,114
Speaker 0: It was not really a fake bar That's all it is.

68
00:04:01,335 --> 00:04:05,150
Speaker 0: it's a fake not really grassroots but like they put a bunch of buzz out.

69
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,626
Speaker 0: Pretending the buzz says that this thing is getting really popular.

70
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:18,418
Speaker 1: if you haven't already heard Yeah, if you buy your local newspaper and in it you see an article that says cell phone jammers Controversy, you know, they're their.

71
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,730
Speaker 1: cell phone jammers are made by the following companies This company makes this one and this company makes this one.

72
00:04:23,098 --> 00:04:23,590
Speaker 1: Guess what?

73
00:04:24,090 --> 00:04:36,530
Speaker 1: That's not some reporter at your newspaper going out and getting the scoop on this that say that same Article or a similar articles in every newspaper and the companies that make those products went to those newspapers and had those articles written.

74
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,016
Speaker 1: That's how PR works.

75
00:04:38,056 --> 00:04:38,920
Speaker 1: Welcome to the world.

76
00:04:39,241 --> 00:04:41,510
Speaker 0: But yeah, I mean, I think the worst example I've ever seen.

77
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,081
Speaker 0: I was in Yonkers reading some Yonkers paper.

78
00:04:44,402 --> 00:04:45,065
Speaker 0: I'm just flipping through.

79
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:46,190
Speaker 0: it is a terrible paper.

80
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:52,410
Speaker 0: But then there's this article about the rise in popularity of renting handbags.

81
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:57,370
Speaker 0: That's right can't afford the four thousand dollar like super fancy handbag.

82
00:04:57,651 --> 00:05:00,488
Speaker 0: You can rent it for a hundred dollars a week for as long as you need it.

83
00:05:01,512 --> 00:05:03,127
Speaker 1: Yeah, if that's not PR, I don't know.

84
00:05:03,147 --> 00:05:12,138
Speaker 0: it is Yeah, and they talked about how this is like really popular among the nouveau riche God, yeah, regardless cell phone jamming.

85
00:05:12,159 --> 00:05:14,848
Speaker 1: It's illegal illegal and it should be.

86
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:19,710
Speaker 1: yes I mean if you need a reason I could argue for like an hour of why it should be illegal.

87
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:22,676
Speaker 1: But I'll just say one thing Nine one one I win.

88
00:05:22,696 --> 00:05:25,625
Speaker 0: Yep, or even doctors with pagers.

89
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:27,009
Speaker 1: I win again.

90
00:05:27,290 --> 00:05:29,919
Speaker 0: Yep, firemen the real issue is people.

91
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:32,990
Speaker 0: a lot of people complain about cell phones being used in public places.

92
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,558
Speaker 0: But there are two kinds of people that complain.

93
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,725
Speaker 0: the first kind is called evil.

94
00:05:37,926 --> 00:05:39,150
Speaker 0: No, that's that's the third kind.

95
00:05:40,236 --> 00:05:45,339
Speaker 0: So there are two kinds three three guys The people.

96
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:57,790
Speaker 0: But the first kind which is kind of legitimate is When you're on the train You're in the restaurant and there's that one guy in the corner and you hear the following.

97
00:05:58,412 --> 00:05:59,235
Speaker 0: So I says to him.

98
00:05:59,316 --> 00:06:00,078
Speaker 0: Hey, can you hear me?

99
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:00,560
Speaker 0: Yeah.

100
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,046
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I says to him.

101
00:06:02,086 --> 00:06:02,226
Speaker 0: Yeah.

102
00:06:02,247 --> 00:06:03,978
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm yelling.

103
00:06:04,038 --> 00:06:05,250
Speaker 0: I'm yelling into my cell phone.

104
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:06,890
Speaker 1: The problem there is not the cell phone.

105
00:06:06,970 --> 00:06:11,719
Speaker 1: The problem there is someone being loud in a quiet place like in a library being loud Cellphone or not.

106
00:06:11,961 --> 00:06:13,010
Speaker 1: cell phone is not the problem.

107
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:23,144
Speaker 0: The loud and quiet place is the problem or not even loud and quiet but also inconsiderate jackass among non inconsiderate non jackasses Uh-huh, and the cell phone is just an enabler.

108
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:31,610
Speaker 0: It's not the root cause Yep, but to the other kind of people complain about people just using cell phones and not like oh he's driving with the cell phone.

109
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:43,550
Speaker 0: But I've seen people and I've been with people who complained about someone who's just walking down the street or in the grocery store Talking quietly no louder than if they'd been talking to someone next to them on a cell phone.

110
00:06:44,252 --> 00:06:47,063
Speaker 0: How is that any more annoying than someone just talking to someone?

111
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:52,081
Speaker 1: I think that's that's the old people, you know They just did say young whippersnappers doing your newfangled.

112
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:53,065
Speaker 0: We got a core.

113
00:06:53,165 --> 00:06:55,454
Speaker 0: much like when we say fat people We don't be like.

114
00:06:55,494 --> 00:07:00,534
Speaker 0: we mean, you know, when we say old people we don't need mean old of age We mean old of spirit.

115
00:07:00,774 --> 00:07:04,545
Speaker 0: Yeah, and not the cool venerable like respect your elders old of spirit.

116
00:07:04,806 --> 00:07:07,416

Speaker 1: I'm playing the Phoenix, right?

119
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,730
Speaker 1: I guess it's why we talk about so much about games on Monday, but there's a crowd.

120
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:16,430
Speaker 1: There is a character who is crotchety and old in spirit.

121
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:21,049
Speaker 0: But there's also a character who was sexy and awesome despite the fact that he has scientific eyes.

122
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:23,097

Speaker 1: they didn't make a big deal out of it, but it happened and it was publicly available information and That company was making a mobile platform basically an operating system for phones much like Symbian or palm or any of those or Windows mobile and Google bought it and it's Linux based and they're gonna put it out and it's gonna be open which means People can make applications for it and people can modify it and all that business.

148
00:09:12,351 --> 00:09:25,990
Speaker 1: Also, there's the second bit of news is that there is an open handset alliance They have formed of 33 different Companies that are involved in phones in some way and all these people have vowed to support this platform in some way.

149
00:09:26,473 --> 00:09:27,178
Speaker 1: you know, they're all.

150
00:09:27,258 --> 00:09:38,758
Speaker 1: they're all in on this right and Microsoft palm Apple not so in on this I know Not so in on it, but everyone else in.

151
00:09:38,998 --> 00:09:45,590
Speaker 0: so yes everyone else the vast number of people Who have power in this industry.

152
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:45,892
Speaker 0: Well, no 33.

153
00:09:45,892 --> 00:09:53,209
Speaker 1: It's basically 33 It's basically all the small guys and Google verse the four big guys.

154
00:09:53,651 --> 00:10:00,190
Speaker 0: The thing is if all the stated like if it works if all this comes to be really then I think they'll win.

155
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:06,109
Speaker 1: Well, no, you see because the thing is while they're gonna you know, it's gonna be a Linux based operating system of whatever, right?

156
00:10:06,610 --> 00:10:12,150
Speaker 1: but You know and if you you could get a copy of it probably off the internet and you could make software for it.

157
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:21,221
Speaker 1: But there's nothing that says say if t-mobile puts it on their phones that it'll be available You know not locked down so you can modify it like on your phone.

158
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:21,983
Speaker 1: There's.

159
00:10:22,023 --> 00:10:24,210
Speaker 1: no you know, it's it's it's no.

160
00:10:24,330 --> 00:10:35,792
Speaker 1: it's basically saying yeah, there's gonna be yet another operating system for phones and Supposedly this one is better than all the other ones out there except for I guess iPhone or maybe hopefully better than iPhone I don't know.

161
00:10:36,194 --> 00:10:41,071
Speaker 0: Well iPhone would be better if it included certain specific features Basically that you know It's.

162
00:10:41,693 --> 00:10:54,730
Speaker 1: I think what's just gonna end up happening is there will be yet another phone operating system That will be better than all the other ones And you know at least in terms of interface and features, but who knows exactly how far it will go?

163
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:57,961
Speaker 1: I don't really think it's gonna be the promised Savior.

164
00:10:58,121 --> 00:11:01,328
Speaker 0: Well, I think one it is definitely a step in the right direction That's for sure.

165
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:12,844
Speaker 0: I mean, this is a problem as a whole that can't really be solved in one fell swoop without government interaction, which is Obviously a loaded event that is probably not desirable in the end.

166
00:11:12,985 --> 00:11:13,386
Speaker 1: loaded.

167
00:11:13,807 --> 00:11:14,650
Speaker 1: It's like three times.

168
00:11:15,993 --> 00:11:16,818
Speaker 1: It's not just loaded.

169
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:17,603
Speaker 1: It's like elites.

170
00:11:17,684 --> 00:11:29,388
Speaker 0: There's two of them but if this were say coupled with lobbying efforts that eventually forced Interoperability or non lockdown this or any sort of thing like that.

171
00:11:30,031 --> 00:11:34,269
Speaker 0: Then suddenly this becomes a very big deal Becomes a very big deal.

172
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:47,486
Speaker 1: You know someone did ask during the thing about the the 700 megahertz auction Which maybe we should talk about sometime exactly what the deal with is, but if I do a show on that Yeah, but the whole idea of like the FCC and controlling frequencies and what what?

173
00:11:47,647 --> 00:11:48,270
Speaker 0: yeah, let's do that.

174
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:49,756
Speaker 1: The general idea is that doesn't?

175
00:11:49,796 --> 00:11:55,095
Speaker 1: there's gonna be a spectrum auction for the 700 megahertz spectrum Which is a pretty hot spectrum.

176
00:11:55,276 --> 00:12:00,410
Speaker 0: and if Google seriously think of this is I think the BBC used the term beachfront property.

177
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:09,981
Speaker 1: Now Basically, all you need to know about this right now cuz I'm not gonna talk anymore about it Is that if Google wins the auction we win too.

178
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:13,268
Speaker 1: if anyone else wins the auction we lose.

179
00:12:14,870 --> 00:12:18,904
Speaker 1: So if you have money to buy Google shares, which are like $700 apiece, I think yeah.

180
00:12:20,931 --> 00:12:25,125
Speaker 0: I remember I wanted to bid on their IPO and I thought like what's the most?

181
00:12:25,265 --> 00:12:28,440
Speaker 0: I cuz it was a weird IPO Where you had like bid an amount of money.

182
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,090
Speaker 1: it was like a Dutch auction thing.

183
00:12:30,154 --> 00:12:39,641
Speaker 0: Yeah It seemed to work out for them because then when it happened like I tried to guess at what the price would eventually end up At and I was off by almost two orders of bag.

184
00:12:39,902 --> 00:12:42,090
Speaker 1: It's not the close of trading today, November 5th.

185
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:46,890
Speaker 1: Google shares are seven hundred and twenty five dollars and sixty five cents.

186
00:12:47,191 --> 00:12:52,542
Speaker 0: Well, uh, I guess if I use my credit card, I could buy a few I And full of them.

187
00:12:53,168 --> 00:12:55,655
Speaker 0: I Feel like I should buy one.

188
00:12:56,036 --> 00:12:59,930
Speaker 1: Well, the more you buy the better chance Google has of winning the auction.

189
00:13:02,551 --> 00:13:07,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, but we should really do a show about that because a lot of people are can feel like you said really confused by what?

190
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:16,730
Speaker 0: These auctions mean and also why the 700 range is so much I guess more important than the much more easily available high frequency bands.

191
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:18,115
Speaker 0: The real like real.

192
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:21,729
Speaker 0: long and short of it is this and long and short of it is kind of a pun.

193
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:27,787
Speaker 0: but Low frequency good penetrates things better high frequency bad blocked by your house.

194
00:13:28,128 --> 00:13:30,371
Speaker 0: Yeah That's as simple as I can put it.

195
00:13:30,471 --> 00:13:40,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's about good things of the day.

196
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:53,880
Speaker 0: So let's say someone took a picture at their wedding and then You know later they look at the pictures and they see that Their dog was like poking out from a stair railing over the guy's shoulder.

197
00:13:54,442 --> 00:13:58,780
Speaker 0: Well, how do you how do you think you would react to that if one of your wedding pictures had your dog looking at you?

198
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,523
Speaker 0: In the background.

199
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:00,851
Speaker 1: No, that's not so bad.

200
00:14:01,474 --> 00:14:11,549
Speaker 0: Well, uh Photoshop if it bothers you that much this family, I guess didn't recognize their own dog decided It was a demon freaked out called Fox News.

201
00:14:11,789 --> 00:14:24,180
Speaker 0: Fox News does this story about oh my god creepy photo And it's clearly a dog like unambiguously a dog looking over the guy's shoulder.

202
00:14:24,928 --> 00:14:27,735
Speaker 1: uh-huh, so What's the is that?

203
00:14:27,775 --> 00:14:28,219
Speaker 1: is that it?

204
00:14:29,341 --> 00:14:29,823
Speaker 0: That's it.

205
00:14:30,145 --> 00:14:32,900
Speaker 0: But I mean, here's the Fox News breaking.

206
00:14:33,643 --> 00:14:38,240
Speaker 0: It's a picture you really have to look at and when you do you notice something is not quite normal.

207
00:14:38,521 --> 00:14:40,386
Speaker 0: In fact, it might be paranormal.

208
00:14:40,466 --> 00:14:42,551
Speaker 0: Fox 31's Tammy vigil report.

209
00:14:42,652 --> 00:14:45,740
Speaker 1: if it is I got a million dollars for you.

210
00:14:46,761 --> 00:14:47,033
Speaker 0: Million.

211
00:14:47,421 --> 00:14:50,995
Speaker 0: There are things like this all the time, but it's like you.

212
00:14:51,035 --> 00:14:52,320
Speaker 1: I saw Jesus in my French toast.

213
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:54,039
Speaker 0: It's not even that it's a dog.

214
00:14:54,421 --> 00:14:56,307
Speaker 0: It's so obviously a dog.

215
00:14:56,487 --> 00:15:00,339
Speaker 0: you would have to be the rain mad would say it's a dog like you got one dog.

216
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:09,877
Speaker 0: But serious and even if it wasn't a dog it's still obviously not a demon.

217
00:15:09,897 --> 00:15:12,571
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, it was a demon at your wedding.

218
00:15:12,591 --> 00:15:13,335
Speaker 1: Your wedding's cursed.

219
00:15:13,355 --> 00:15:15,828
Speaker 1: You better break up You're gonna bring more stupidity into the world.

220
00:15:15,848 --> 00:15:18,240
Speaker 0: I mean you could argue that me wedding was not meant to be.

221
00:15:18,501 --> 00:15:20,973
Speaker 0: Maybe it looks like a champagne bottle, but no, it's a dog.

222
00:15:21,274 --> 00:15:22,460
Speaker 0: It's a dog a dog.

223
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:23,587
Speaker 1: It looks like a champagne bottle.

224
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:24,473
Speaker 1: I can't see this picture.

225
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:25,419
Speaker 1: You need to rotate your chair.

226
00:15:26,821 --> 00:15:27,406
Speaker 1: That's a dog.

227
00:15:27,789 --> 00:15:30,366
Speaker 1: I Can see from here it's a dog.

228
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,356
Speaker 0: All right, so I'll just leave it.

229
00:15:32,397 --> 00:15:32,960
Speaker 0: there's a video.

230
00:15:33,242 --> 00:15:42,917
Speaker 0: you can see the people who took the picture reacting and these people are either lying for attention or really really dumb.

231
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:46,664
Speaker 1: Yep, well Everyone likes toilet humor.

232
00:15:46,704 --> 00:15:47,526
Speaker 1: You like toilet humor.

233
00:15:48,068 --> 00:15:51,517
Speaker 0: I am a man who for some four years read poop report every week.

234
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:55,136
Speaker 0: P Have I talked about poop report on this show?

235
00:15:55,156 --> 00:15:55,680
Speaker 1: You will later.

236
00:15:55,781 --> 00:16:04,388
Speaker 1: so Today I saw this video from the World Toilet Summit and Expo 2007 in New Delhi India.

237
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:06,254
Speaker 0: that sounds like an awesome place to be.

238
00:16:06,274 --> 00:16:08,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like toilet Expo not New Delhi.

239
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:15,060
Speaker 1: It's like a big trade show for toilets and toilet and you know I guess what's it called septic technologies?

240
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,977
Speaker 0: so I have a question does this conference address the fact that the u.s.

241
00:16:19,499 --> 00:16:24,200
Speaker 0: is Pretty much a third world country when it comes to having an enjoyable peeing experience?

242
00:16:24,461 --> 00:16:25,646
Speaker 1: I think it might.

243
00:16:25,726 --> 00:16:26,369
Speaker 1: in some places.

244
00:16:26,389 --> 00:16:29,020
Speaker 1: they had a lot of very fancy and futuristic toilets.

245
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:35,003
Speaker 1: You know trying all sorts of innovation in the waste disposal, you know Futuristic.

246
00:16:35,024 --> 00:16:37,377
Speaker 0: you mean they had him 40 years ago in Japan, right?

247
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:43,040
Speaker 1: Well, they actually had some stuff that you know You know actually new as far as the world is concerned.

248
00:16:43,249 --> 00:16:48,039
Speaker 0: Yeah but but also I'm just really complaining about the fact that I can't have an enjoyable pee in the u.s.

249
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:53,239
Speaker 1: A lot of what they're focusing on though is the fact that most of the world doesn't have toilets.

250
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:58,774
Speaker 1: There are people without toilets and they're like, hey the UN is trying to get toilets.

251
00:16:58,834 --> 00:17:06,099
Speaker 0: You know, see it's tricky because America has toilets, but they're old wasteful toilets or they're low flow toilets.

252
00:17:07,060 --> 00:17:10,440
Speaker 0: Other than German toilets, I think we have the worst toilets in the developed world.

253
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:13,992
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe except for the completely absolutely no toilets.

254
00:17:14,012 --> 00:17:24,387
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at least when there's that well I'm not gonna get into that because that's a whole other problem and I guess I should feel bad Complaining that my peeing experience is somewhat so optimal when there are people who pee in the water.

255
00:17:24,426 --> 00:17:24,807
Speaker 0: They drink.

256
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:30,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time I really think we could have better toilets in the u.s.

257
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:34,162
Speaker 1: If the only way if it was like a pond, right Why would I?

258
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:37,578
Speaker 1: I would just pee on the ground instead of the water in the ground?

259
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:44,199
Speaker 0: Okay Now there's a lot of people and they all pee in the ground and then it rains and that seeps into your drinking water And there's really no way around that.

260
00:17:44,421 --> 00:17:49,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it wouldn't be as bad as everyone peeing directly in the war like in the movie the man who would be king.

261
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:54,831
Speaker 0: You know how he conquers all the tribes and goes up the river because every tribe downriver Hates the tribe up the river.

262
00:17:54,871 --> 00:17:57,417
Speaker 0: cuz they pee in the river Cuz they don't care.

263
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,243
Speaker 0: Cuz there's not.

264
00:17:59,324 --> 00:18:03,500
Speaker 0: obviously there's nothing downriver that matters except the other Sean Connery.

265
00:18:04,241 --> 00:18:05,366
Speaker 1: Yeah, I didn't see that movie.

266
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:08,480
Speaker 0: So that's the movie Jess was trying to make you watch cuz it's awesome.

267
00:18:08,862 --> 00:18:15,800
Speaker 1: But anyway, you watch this and there's some pretty interesting Pee and poop technologies here that you can be amused by especially this one girl.

268
00:18:15,921 --> 00:18:17,150
Speaker 1: She's like way younger than us.

269
00:18:17,231 --> 00:18:24,173
Speaker 1: like she I think he's like a teenager But she invented some sort of cool way for trains to dump their waste without.

270
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:36,900
Speaker 0: you know The US wastes a lot of water Which is particularly bad because people in the south waste water that they're buying from the north that is depleting the Great Lakes.

271
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:41,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a real problem with just people insisting on living in places that don't have water.

272
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,889
Speaker 0: It's not even that because they could.

273
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,216
Speaker 0: there are ways to do that.

274
00:18:44,297 --> 00:18:44,840
Speaker 0: very well.

275
00:18:45,141 --> 00:18:54,360
Speaker 0: The problem is and as my mother put pointed out so angrily There are people who live in New York and they get sick in New York and they want to move out west.

276
00:18:54,442 --> 00:19:04,020
Speaker 0: They moved to Arizona But then they decide that they want a golf course and a green sod lawn and they have a sandy golf course.

277
00:19:04,186 --> 00:19:10,600
Speaker 0: No These people have greener lawns than I had when I lived in the suburbs in Michigan in the middle of the desert.

278
00:19:11,043 --> 00:19:13,660
Speaker 1: I don't understand the obsession with what your lawn looks like.

279
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:14,242
Speaker 1: I really.

280
00:19:14,262 --> 00:19:15,386
Speaker 1: I just don't get any.

281
00:19:15,587 --> 00:19:20,504
Speaker 1: as long as it's not like a forest and you can't walk around because it's you know Full of ticks and things.

282
00:19:20,585 --> 00:19:29,100
Speaker 0: my line the line between lawn is okay and law needs something done about it is When there are dead things hidden in the law.

283
00:19:29,321 --> 00:19:34,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty mad is pretty much the line that's my line also or when it's dangerous to walk across my lawn.

284
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:42,640
Speaker 0: But maybe if the US adopted some of these technologies, which we could but we don't for reasons that are very complicated.

285
00:19:42,802 --> 00:19:46,849
Speaker 0: Actually, they're not complicated at all Like in America, right?

286
00:19:46,869 --> 00:19:48,980
Speaker 0: We have high flow toilets and they're awesome.

287
00:19:49,181 --> 00:19:55,448
Speaker 0: My poop goes away and that's probably time doesn't cloud the most important thing to me Yep, but then oh they're waste a lot of water.

288
00:19:55,709 --> 00:19:58,079
Speaker 0: All right, let's use low flow toilets.

289
00:19:58,279 --> 00:19:59,524
Speaker 1: now My poop is still there.

290
00:19:59,544 --> 00:20:00,206
Speaker 0: I flush.

291
00:20:00,246 --> 00:20:01,190
Speaker 0: He won't go away.

292
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:01,751
Speaker 0: He's still there.

293
00:20:01,792 --> 00:20:02,253
Speaker 0: flush again.

294
00:20:02,273 --> 00:20:03,036
Speaker 0: Poop still there.

295
00:20:03,357 --> 00:20:05,984
Speaker 0: take like the Cardboard the toilet paper.

296
00:20:06,004 --> 00:20:07,950
Speaker 0: bring the poo into you float you.

297
00:20:08,131 --> 00:20:11,080
Speaker 1: now you've put flush so many times that you've wasted more water.

298
00:20:11,381 --> 00:20:13,648
Speaker 0: It's kind of like the low flow showerhead great.

299
00:20:13,889 --> 00:20:14,050
Speaker 0: Now.

300
00:20:14,090 --> 00:20:28,640
Speaker 0: I take a shower twice as long because I couldn't clean myself Yep, but there are places like Japan where they just have two buttons a button if you have a big thing and a button if You have a little thing and the little button uses low flow and the big button gets rid of my poop.

301
00:20:29,502 --> 00:20:31,611
Speaker 1: I guess Americans are just too stupid to have two buttons.

302
00:20:31,872 --> 00:20:33,640
Speaker 1: I mean, they can't even use like a computer.

303
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:39,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think we'll leave it at that you got.

304
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:42,280
Speaker 1: these old people can't even use a cell phone even though it's just like phones.

305
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,063
Speaker 1: They've used their whole.

306
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:47,000
Speaker 0: you know what they probably think like oh man back in the day toilets were great.

307
00:20:47,081 --> 00:20:48,188
Speaker 0: What happened to this country?

308
00:20:48,450 --> 00:20:48,712
Speaker 1: Yep.

309
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:51,846
Speaker 1: Oh Old people making everything bad for everyone else.

310
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:52,247
Speaker 1: All right.

311
00:20:52,487 --> 00:20:54,654
Speaker 0: So speaking of old people.

312
00:20:55,396 --> 00:20:58,102
Speaker 0: I don't know speaking of Anything.

313
00:20:58,705 --> 00:21:02,380
Speaker 0: our topic tonight is something kind of out of the blue because we couldn't come up with much else.

314
00:21:02,741 --> 00:21:04,066
Speaker 0: Scott doesn't know much about science.

315
00:21:04,428 --> 00:21:07,380
Speaker 1: I know about science averagely across the board.

316
00:21:08,646 --> 00:21:09,558
Speaker 0: All right, I'll leave it at that.

317
00:21:11,022 --> 00:21:26,660
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about something that's in the news kind of often But yet I don't think a lot of people really understand and we're gonna talk about this in a very kind of non technical overview way just to get an idea of What it what does matter and what you should worry about but more importantly what you shouldn't worry about?

318
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:32,880
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm people talk a lot about IT warfare or computer warfare internet warfare cyber war.

319
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:39,860
Speaker 0: China's got a cyber army ready to strike and yeah, you know Russia attacked Estonia a while ago, which is true.

320
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:46,693
Speaker 1: Yep, okay first of all You got to realize that the vast majority of this stuff is just fear mongering.

321
00:21:46,733 --> 00:21:54,920
Speaker 1: people are coming up with words like cyber war To try to scare you and make you think that you know, there's dangerous hackers coming to get you.

322
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,157
Speaker 1: Oh, no running hide computers of the devil.

323
00:21:57,177 --> 00:21:59,125
Speaker 0: now I'll say this you have to.

324
00:21:59,145 --> 00:22:09,260
Speaker 0: you have a lot more to be afraid of by clicking on spam and being phished or Just having someone steal your credit card information from some company you shopped with five years.

325
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,208
Speaker 1: You have more to worry about Nigerian scams.

326
00:22:12,131 --> 00:22:14,280
Speaker 0: I think you have more to worry about driving your car.

327
00:22:14,742 --> 00:22:22,132
Speaker 0: Oh, definitely, but at the same time that what the real issue with cyber warfare is not OMG China's gonna get you.

328
00:22:22,694 --> 00:22:31,098
Speaker 0: but the fact that cyber warfare is something that hasn't really been I guess vetted out by the armies and militaries of the world.

329
00:22:31,259 --> 00:22:34,252
Speaker 0: and Eventually, there's going to be a war of some kind.

330
00:22:34,272 --> 00:22:36,642
Speaker 0: Yep in the modern world I mean think of this.

331
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:48,918
Speaker 0: when was the last time there was a war between two powers that were both fully industrialized or at least equally industrialized and above the level of poverty?

332
00:22:48,938 --> 00:22:49,660
Speaker 0: or third-world?

333
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:50,724
Speaker 1: Me me.

334
00:22:50,885 --> 00:22:51,748
Speaker 0: Oh me.

335
00:22:52,029 --> 00:22:54,257
Speaker 1: I'll get islands pop possible.

336
00:22:54,417 --> 00:22:55,100
Speaker 1: Ah, yeah.

337
00:22:55,180 --> 00:22:57,409
Speaker 0: And how did the Falken Islands go?

338
00:22:57,429 --> 00:23:00,020
Speaker 1: not too well for either side?

339
00:23:01,739 --> 00:23:05,088
Speaker 0: I Mean as a zero punctuation pointed out so eloquently.

340
00:23:05,169 --> 00:23:10,958
Speaker 0: most of America's wars recently have involves stomping on people who can't fight back And then walking away merrily.

341
00:23:11,642 --> 00:23:14,529
Speaker 0: Something like that, but it's very rare not?

342
00:23:14,549 --> 00:23:23,218
Speaker 0: I mean the Falkland Islands and before that what World War two The Korean War and even then the Korean War was more a matter of the.

343
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:26,254
Speaker 0: well I guess the Korean War and the Falklands were similar in one regard.

344
00:23:26,757 --> 00:23:41,395
Speaker 0: It was a super powerful country Extending its power very far away from itself and thus was only able to expend a very small part of its power and thus was able to be Held off by a technologically inferior foe like that Vietnam or that Iraq.

345
00:23:41,415 --> 00:23:49,800
Speaker 0: Oh But There has not been a time really since and I know some military people might disagree.

346
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:51,786
Speaker 0: But I'm talking broadly in terms of technology.

347
00:23:52,207 --> 00:23:57,905
Speaker 0: World War two was probably I mean that was when there were powers that were Relatively equal in technology.

348
00:23:57,925 --> 00:24:02,760
Speaker 0: In fact, the Germans outpaced the rest of the powers pretty substantially in technology.

349
00:24:03,301 --> 00:24:04,965
Speaker 1: The new boats watch out.

350
00:24:05,386 --> 00:24:11,384
Speaker 0: new kinds of warfare appeared then and war was a very uncertain business because it wasn't like war had been Before.

351
00:24:11,747 --> 00:24:12,999
Speaker 0: World War one was similar.

352
00:24:13,582 --> 00:24:16,291
Speaker 0: It was a kind of warfare that had barely been tested.

353
00:24:16,331 --> 00:24:17,735
Speaker 0: people didn't know what to expect.

354
00:24:18,076 --> 00:24:21,967
Speaker 0: people tried old Things and World War two had that too.

355
00:24:22,007 --> 00:24:23,592
Speaker 0: I mean the Majano line.

356
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,197
Speaker 0: that was hot shit.

357
00:24:25,418 --> 00:24:26,080
Speaker 1: It was hot shit.

358
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:27,819
Speaker 1: That's why they walked around it because if they went in.

359
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:36,220
Speaker 0: Except theoretically the Majano line was so obsolete by the time it came into play that the Germans probably could have stomped over.

360
00:24:36,321 --> 00:24:38,540
Speaker 1: Regardless maybe it's a tough call.

361
00:24:38,761 --> 00:24:42,457
Speaker 1: well because the thing even though is obsolete it was still a lot of really big guns.

362
00:24:42,537 --> 00:24:47,060
Speaker 1: and you know Even if I come in here with an obsolete old-ass gun, I guess they'll blow your brain.

363
00:24:47,101 --> 00:24:52,499
Speaker 0: It was big guns but it was big guns designed to be used against a slow marching army and it was defense of.

364
00:24:52,801 --> 00:24:58,360
Speaker 0: Well, it wasn't defensive death and if the Germans just paratroop it a bunch of people behind it, huh?

365
00:24:58,660 --> 00:24:59,004
Speaker 1: They might.

366
00:24:59,044 --> 00:25:00,460
Speaker 1: or maybe yeah, it would have been tough.

367
00:25:00,541 --> 00:25:10,360
Speaker 0: I've read accounts both ways but the point is that I think the Germans had the better plan of walk around though to not go into a lot of Because I kept introducing topics and then realizing that I had a lot to say and trying to back out.

368
00:25:10,569 --> 00:25:10,718
Speaker 1: Yeah

369
00:25:10,921 --> 00:25:36,839
Speaker 0: the point is cyber warfare is a new kind of warfare that has not been tested and No one really knows what to expect and the the kinds of fighting that would go on are possibly Alien to even modern powers like the United States because kind of like how the great reason Napoleon was able to do So well was that he used very simple tactics that no just no one else had thought of.

370
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:40,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, well cyber warfare pretty much boils down to this, right?

371
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:44,240
Speaker 1: When you're when you're at war with someone, you know for real, right?

372
00:25:44,481 --> 00:25:49,014
Speaker 1: You generally want to hurt them or their infrastructure or you know them in some way.

373
00:25:49,135 --> 00:26:00,379
Speaker 0: and yeah war is not like it was before the world wars where you know Two armies would march out to the field and talk a little bit and agree on a place and then stand nicely in line Shooting at each other for an hour.

374
00:26:01,142 --> 00:26:12,697
Speaker 1: So, you know many industrialized countries in the world and even not so industrialized countries have a lot of technology be it You know computers on the internet or other things that they rely on Heavily.

375
00:26:12,879 --> 00:26:18,629
Speaker 1: and if though, you know Like think about it if your computer if every computer in your house stops working for a week that bothers you a bit.

376
00:26:19,193 --> 00:26:21,889
Speaker 1: Imagine if every computer at a company stopped working for a week.

377
00:26:22,631 --> 00:26:26,969
Speaker 1: Alright now imagine if say every computer for the state government stopped working for a week.

378
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:28,760
Speaker 0: Well knowing the u.s.

379
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,370
Speaker 0: That would have no effect on anything.

380
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:30,974
Speaker 1: But I know.

381
00:26:31,095 --> 00:26:40,472
Speaker 1: but the point is is that when you you know You depend on technology and even if you don't depend on it and you still have you know The backup of paper or whatever, you know It's it's.

382
00:26:40,713 --> 00:26:44,347
Speaker 1: it is madly less efficient than we're used to and you're going to be hindered.

383
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:49,702
Speaker 1: and if your opponent Still has the efficient computers working and you don't you're at a disadvantage.

384
00:26:49,742 --> 00:27:03,661
Speaker 1: So cyber warfare what really boils down to is Someone is using technology and there are things you can do to disable enemy technology and slow them down Damage them or make them less efficient than you.

385
00:27:03,681 --> 00:27:05,610
Speaker 1: that aren't really.

386
00:27:06,111 --> 00:27:08,459
Speaker 1: Don't really fit into the idea of classical warfare.

387
00:27:08,519 --> 00:27:11,408
Speaker 1: blow them up or you know stuff or steal their stuff.

388
00:27:11,668 --> 00:27:19,374
Speaker 0: and furthermore I mean it just comes down to if you're if it's an actual war total warfare the point where you were fighting Holy as a nation.

389
00:27:19,394 --> 00:27:21,259
Speaker 0: No nations mobilized for war.

390
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:32,050
Speaker 0: in that case much like the carpet bombings of the days of yore You Generally try to do whatever you can to disrupt the economy and the daily lives of people in the country.

391
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:38,915
Speaker 0: You're fighting in order to disrupt the war machine prevent the bits from being made to be put in the other bits to be shot At you.

392
00:27:38,935 --> 00:27:43,049
Speaker 0: Yep This we're not arguing for or against these concepts.

393
00:27:43,271 --> 00:27:46,307
Speaker 0: No, this is just kind of like from the cold-hearted strategic perspective.

394
00:27:46,327 --> 00:27:46,850
Speaker 0: this you know.

395
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:58,330
Speaker 1: This could range from anything such as using like EMPs in their cities to screw all their stuff up to You know spamming them so much that they can't read their email communications.

396
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:04,325
Speaker 0: So IT warfare is a very very broad thing and it can cover a lot of.

397
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:05,770
Speaker 0: it can cover everything.

398
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,918
Speaker 0: It's not like it's this special separate thing.

399
00:28:07,958 --> 00:28:11,030
Speaker 0: It's just a new extension of existing war doctrine.

400
00:28:11,393 --> 00:28:13,690
Speaker 0: The problem is it's untested and no one knows what to expect.

401
00:28:13,690 --> 00:28:14,999
Speaker 1: I mean, you know think about it if you want.

402
00:28:15,019 --> 00:28:18,599
Speaker 1: if back in the day, right you had tanks The other guy had tanks you want to destroy his tanks.

403
00:28:18,881 --> 00:28:20,087
Speaker 1: There was only one way to do that.

404
00:28:20,428 --> 00:28:21,497
Speaker 1: Boom That was it.

405
00:28:21,517 --> 00:28:22,607
Speaker 1: That's that was your only choice.

406
00:28:22,687 --> 00:28:26,463
Speaker 1: now The other guys using a tank but the tank has a computer in it.

407
00:28:26,483 --> 00:28:27,166
Speaker 1: that depends on.

408
00:28:27,206 --> 00:28:29,073
Speaker 1: so you don't really have to attack the Tank with boom.

409
00:28:29,093 --> 00:28:30,821
Speaker 1: I mean you could attack computers with boom.

410
00:28:30,861 --> 00:28:32,970
Speaker 1: that that's that's a valid strategy.

411
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:36,150
Speaker 1: But there are other because it's electronic.

412
00:28:36,311 --> 00:28:38,560
Speaker 1: There are other ways that you can attack electronics.

413
00:28:38,661 --> 00:28:40,729
Speaker 1: I have all these weapons that open up to you.

414
00:28:41,132 --> 00:28:53,284
Speaker 0: Let's say the tanks of this power are Coordinated by a commander somewhere far away or by a flag tank and that flag tank or that commander communicate Wirelessly with all the other tanks in the area.

415
00:28:53,304 --> 00:28:59,045
Speaker 0: I Disrupt that wireless signal now instead of having one large cohesive force.

416
00:28:59,546 --> 00:29:16,295
Speaker 0: I have 50 Independent powerful forces, but they without that cohesion They effectively have to act semi independently or based on the last orders They got or whatever contingency plan they had and if my technology is still working I'm the win.

417
00:29:16,898 --> 00:29:22,238
Speaker 0: or if they do the same thing to me and both of our Technologies are disabled now who wins?

418
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:32,978
Speaker 0: the battle doesn't come down to the traditional ideas but it comes down to either the ingenuity of the individual tank commanders or The robustness of the countermeasures.

419
00:29:33,038 --> 00:29:37,010
Speaker 0: are the robustness of the contingency plans in case of said failings.

420
00:29:37,170 --> 00:29:46,610
Speaker 0: Mmm and warfare suddenly becomes this kind of game counter game Technologically to the point that the war is almost decided before the bullets are fired.

421
00:29:47,392 --> 00:29:47,873
Speaker 1: Pretty much.

422
00:29:47,914 --> 00:30:04,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know if you you know depend on the technology so much that you know It runs the whole show and without it, you know you basically only have this, you know X is all you can do if it all stops working and Then that sets really all you've got a hundred percent.

423
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:11,686
Speaker 0: The other stuff is just if any of it still works bonus I mean and this I'd look at the US what we invaded Iraq great.

424
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:12,750
Speaker 0: That was that was wonderful.

425
00:30:12,871 --> 00:30:13,755
Speaker 0: I'm glad we did that.

426
00:30:13,896 --> 00:30:16,370
Speaker 0: that worked so well for everyone, but it's fantastic.

427
00:30:17,413 --> 00:30:18,678
Speaker 0: Look at how it played out.

428
00:30:18,718 --> 00:30:21,610
Speaker 0: We had this technology and they didn't so effectively.

429
00:30:22,114 --> 00:30:23,989
Speaker 0: We never didn't have to worry about this at all.

430
00:30:24,371 --> 00:30:34,640
Speaker 0: There was the nation of Iraq had zero capability of projecting force outside of its borders and as a result We could basically have the majority of our power.

431
00:30:34,780 --> 00:30:38,230
Speaker 0: our economy our command structure our planning.

432
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:43,805
Speaker 0: everything was 100% safe and could just sit there and make decisions.

433
00:30:44,186 --> 00:30:54,544
Speaker 0: and because Iraq had no way to in any way Stop those decisions from being communicated Effectively we could fight a war at our leisure and just command units on a computer screen.

434
00:30:55,046 --> 00:30:58,988
Speaker 0: Yep against a Real power like China that might not happen.

435
00:31:00,052 --> 00:31:01,969
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it definitely won't happen.

436
00:31:02,135 --> 00:31:05,464
Speaker 0: well let's talk about specifics because that's the more interesting part.

437
00:31:05,504 --> 00:31:10,650
Speaker 0: pick a few topics and Like I think satellites is actually the big one and a lot of people have been talking about this lately.

438
00:31:10,851 --> 00:31:17,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean because generally, you know nowadays you think about it Not too many, you know, not many of the super generals.

439
00:31:17,183 --> 00:31:18,910
Speaker 1: actually, you know, it's not like in the olden days.

440
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:27,660
Speaker 1: They're like, you know, the Czar would go out to the war himself, you know in Russia or anything, you know You communicate around the world very pretty much instantly.

441
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, Bush or playing is not gonna be sitting in a tank.

442
00:31:31,171 --> 00:31:41,462
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what you do is yet the only way to communicate around the world like that is either some sort of you know cable Which is not so reliable because it goes through all these countries.

443
00:31:41,502 --> 00:31:43,870
Speaker 1: who knows who's gonna you know be spying on that whatnot?

444
00:31:44,184 --> 00:31:51,489
Speaker 0: or satellites and Or I guess ad hoc mesh network something fancy when I get into that.

445
00:31:51,509 --> 00:32:02,186
Speaker 1: satellites I think are definitely the least susceptible to Interception because it goes from you to space to space to you as opposed from you know You to somewhere else on the ground to somewhere else on the ground.

446
00:32:02,206 --> 00:32:07,854
Speaker 0: somewhere else on the ground You might think all right, but this is an asymmetric situation and it is but not in the way you think it is all right.

447
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:16,006
Speaker 0: US or Generic high-powered Western power has satellites everywhere and the military is linked by satellites and uses satellites for everything.

448
00:32:16,327 --> 00:32:19,435
Speaker 0: and we can project force Anywhere on the globe.

449
00:32:19,516 --> 00:32:28,488
Speaker 0: and we have force projection centers moving about all communicating centrally via these satellites You might think well, it's so hard to put a satellite up.

450
00:32:29,111 --> 00:32:34,529
Speaker 0: Alright, therefore the US just wins because they have these satellites and no one else can protect force worldwide like that.

451
00:32:35,278 --> 00:32:42,130
Speaker 0: Well, uh It's a lot cheaper to shoot some big heavy thing up that bumps into a satellite and breaks it.

452
00:32:42,571 --> 00:32:44,500
Speaker 0: Then it is to make a satellite and put it up.

453
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:52,829
Speaker 1: Yeah satellites super fragile super expensive super Everything a rock cheap now.

454
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:54,166
Speaker 0: See now think of this the.

455
00:32:54,207 --> 00:33:03,890
Speaker 0: you know if the United States went to war with China something I don't think would actually happen because I Generally think that the leadership of China is smart enough to realize that would be a bad idea.

456
00:33:04,312 --> 00:33:11,928
Speaker 0: I generally think the leadership of Taiwan is smart enough to not suddenly declare independence even though they effectively are independent in all but name.

457
00:33:11,948 --> 00:33:17,629
Speaker 0: and The China is certainly not stupid enough to no one's stupid enough to make that situation blow up.

458
00:33:18,433 --> 00:33:20,582
Speaker 0: But if it were to happen just hypothetically, let's say the u.s.

459
00:33:20,823 --> 00:33:24,208
Speaker 0: China decides to invade Taiwan China's right there.

460
00:33:24,811 --> 00:33:37,080
Speaker 0: so they don't need global force projection power other than possibly nuclear submarines as a Engage externally or something, but we'll ignore that.

461
00:33:37,100 --> 00:33:39,710
Speaker 0: for the second their infrastructures all local.

462
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:54,450
Speaker 0: They could get on probably pretty well without satellites because they could set up Locally some sort of relay communication network very likely to keep their military in Contact with the head of the military or at least to keep large units cohesive.

463
00:33:55,212 --> 00:34:07,949
Speaker 0: Also, they would probably be projecting their force almost entirely at Taiwan with possibly some sort of maintenance action in the direction Of Japan or whatever powers nearby just to keep them off long enough for them to win the war.

464
00:34:09,092 --> 00:34:13,929
Speaker 0: So they don't really need satellites US trying to get there and intervene.

465
00:34:14,833 --> 00:34:16,096
Speaker 0: We need satellites.

466
00:34:16,717 --> 00:34:20,850
Speaker 0: We need methods of our carrier groups to communicate with central authorities.

467
00:34:21,773 --> 00:34:26,350
Speaker 1: I'm sure I'm sure the US military has plenty of plans like if the satellites don't work do this.

468
00:34:26,429 --> 00:34:29,630
Speaker 0: It's not like don't do this, but one thing the US has done throughout his history.

469
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:34,478
Speaker 0: You know every now and then there's a news article like oh my god The US is planning to invade Canada.

470
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:44,830
Speaker 0: the US in order to train its military Strategists for since I think a long time ago a very long time ago Continually writes up contingency plans for everything.

471
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:48,165
Speaker 1: They have a plan guys who just sit around all day going.

472
00:34:48,205 --> 00:34:49,409
Speaker 1: What if this crazy thing happened?

473
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:50,349
Speaker 1: Well write a plan for it.

474
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:51,293
Speaker 1: What if this crazy thing happened?

475
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:51,978
Speaker 1: write a plan for it.

476
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:54,489
Speaker 1: and that way if a crazy thing ever happens?

477
00:34:55,072 --> 00:35:01,230
Speaker 1: They go and they bring up this document that says here's what to do and they do what it says and they continually update these.

478
00:35:01,391 --> 00:35:10,229
Speaker 0: Yep, but at the same time how the technology is changing so rapidly that I wonder how rapidly the US large system can keep up with it.

479
00:35:10,249 --> 00:35:14,830
Speaker 0: and Also, how quickly can they deploy these technologies to a rapidly changing theater?

480
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:21,368
Speaker 1: Yeah, and how rapidly can they put up defenses to technologies that other people might use that they didn't think of?

481
00:35:21,649 --> 00:35:28,520
Speaker 0: yeah It's it's a very tricky situation that makes war asymmetric But not in the traditional way of.

482
00:35:28,922 --> 00:35:40,350
Speaker 0: you know we can project force to your country And you can't do anything return But oh you can project force in non-traditional ways by having gorillas or Terrorists or something that we can't fight easily against with a big army.

483
00:35:40,451 --> 00:35:42,390
Speaker 1: I mean I mean you think about arms races.

484
00:35:42,611 --> 00:35:47,550
Speaker 1: You know back in the day in the traditional sense, and it was like you know we made a rocket that goes farther.

485
00:35:47,832 --> 00:35:49,870
Speaker 1: We made a rocket that goes farther and blows up bigger.

486
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:52,580
Speaker 1: We made a plane that can fly longer and drop more bombs.

487
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:55,510
Speaker 1: You know, but that's sort of that's easy to understand.

488
00:35:55,893 --> 00:35:58,530
Speaker 1: What if it's you know and that that kind of stuff you looks like you invent it?

489
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,238
Speaker 1: You know month to month year to year.

490
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:01,282
Speaker 1: you know you and you.

491
00:36:01,403 --> 00:36:01,624
Speaker 1: you know.

492
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:02,970
Speaker 1: you know what the effects of that are gonna be.

493
00:36:03,010 --> 00:36:03,774
Speaker 1: They're pretty simple.

494
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,383
Speaker 1: We're gonna be able to blow up more stuff.

495
00:36:05,403 --> 00:36:09,608
Speaker 1: You know blow up something farther away We'll be able to defend against getting blown up some better.

496
00:36:09,628 --> 00:36:12,601
Speaker 0: now Let's look at another kind of asymmetric information warfare.

497
00:36:12,642 --> 00:36:13,405
Speaker 0: this one's a little more.

498
00:36:13,445 --> 00:36:27,307
Speaker 0: I guess IT related Suppose all right the US or Western powers or large industrialized powers and Japan even China now to a degree Rely on their IT infrastructure for the majority of their business like the.

499
00:36:27,728 --> 00:36:37,570
Speaker 0: the IT Infrastructure is extremely important to that country Not important to a relatively technologically non advanced or possibly third world power.

500
00:36:37,590 --> 00:37:04,118
Speaker 0: Yep, so if that power is fighting an asymmetric war by using terrorists or gorillas or Irregular units or anything that a large power couldn't just straight-up fight against it's very easy for them to project small amounts of force on very vital things like transatlantic cables or specific infrastructure junk engines that crit that just cripple the Infrastructure.

501
00:37:04,642 --> 00:37:05,428
Speaker 0: yeah things like that.

502
00:37:05,488 --> 00:37:14,270
Speaker 0: now Blowing up a power plant in Afghanistan does not have nearly the impact of blowing up a power plant in a major urban center in say the United States or

503
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:20,610
Speaker 1: US you could blow up like a handful of power plants, and there'd be a blackout that would be enormous for a long time.

504
00:37:20,731 --> 00:37:23,710
Speaker 0: No at the same time that sort of thing is not trivial to pull off.

505
00:37:25,011 --> 00:37:26,441
Speaker 1: That's incredibly difficult to pull

506
00:37:26,642 --> 00:37:39,536
Speaker 0: off, but at the same time I guess the real point I'm trying to make without getting into details because I don't want to elicit too many Arguments right now, and I want to be broad is that when we rely so much upon technology especially technology That's advancing so quickly

507
00:37:40,118 --> 00:37:42,850
Speaker 1: and when we use technology so much to gain an advantage

508
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:55,322
Speaker 0: You can get into a situation where suddenly your force multipliers or the things that prop your economy up are single points of failure that can be Targeted with relatively little amounts of force or

509
00:37:55,422 --> 00:37:57,030
Speaker 1: even if they're multiple points of failure.

510
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:00,610
Speaker 1: And you have this wonderful redundant system, and you thought the whole thing out and you're well.

511
00:38:00,730 --> 00:38:03,380
Speaker 1: You know you you're you're well defended, and you thought of everything.

512
00:38:04,143 --> 00:38:08,154
Speaker 1: even so you now have Another target set.

513
00:38:08,174 --> 00:38:17,389
Speaker 1: you have a thing that is helping you win in some way and people can target that whereas before All they targeted was you directly and there really wasn't this sort of you know.

514
00:38:17,449 --> 00:38:19,772
Speaker 1: aha We have all these other things to target You know

515
00:38:20,313 --> 00:38:40,082
Speaker 0: but a lot of that is kind of moot because I'm of the opinion that that sort of warfare Barring something incredible happening is not a very likely possibility because history has shown that in the modern era Industrialized powers do not like to fight against each other because it generally doesn't benefit anyone.

516
00:38:40,363 --> 00:38:42,870
Speaker 0: they like to fight against non industrialized powers.

517
00:38:42,971 --> 00:38:45,323
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the democratic peace theory.

518
00:38:45,524 --> 00:38:46,690
Speaker 0: We don't need to worry about.

519
00:38:47,177 --> 00:38:47,969
Speaker 0: Let's not get into that.

520
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:50,058
Speaker 0: We don't need to worry about that.

521
00:38:50,440 --> 00:38:52,930
Speaker 0: here is the IT warfare that we do need to worry about.

522
00:38:53,051 --> 00:38:55,710
Speaker 0: I think they're going to be wars in our lifetime.

523
00:38:56,252 --> 00:38:56,432
Speaker 0: We're.

524
00:38:56,472 --> 00:39:00,144
Speaker 0: not a single bullet is fired and not a single death is caused directly.

525
00:39:00,545 --> 00:39:01,950
Speaker 0: We're gonna have economic wars.

526
00:39:02,233 --> 00:39:03,890
Speaker 0: We're going to have information wars.

527
00:39:04,512 --> 00:39:09,210
Speaker 0: I mean imagine a war where China is trying to pressure the u.s.

528
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:14,879
Speaker 0: into recognizing the non-independence of Taiwan or something and The u.s.. Decides not to.

529
00:39:14,959 --> 00:39:33,510
Speaker 0: and a war begins where China Starts flooding markets with spurious orders and starts cutting transatlantic cables and starts trying to bring down the global DNS structure because they've already built internally their own DNS structure or Because of the quote great wall firewall of China.

530
00:39:34,373 --> 00:39:38,350
Speaker 0: They have an infrastructure that could exist semi-independent of the United States infrastructure.

531
00:39:38,433 --> 00:39:46,870
Speaker 0: Yeah They can attack the United States economy by having a bunch of skilled people sitting in rooms with keyboards typing furiously.

532
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:55,113
Speaker 1: They could also attack the world's economy with straight-up economic warfare with their piles of dollars or they could do both Simultaneously.

533
00:39:55,393 --> 00:39:56,416
Speaker 1: even worse suddenly

534
00:39:56,456 --> 00:40:13,658
Speaker 0: call upon US debt that they own suddenly ally with Russia and flood the markets with something simultaneously attacking the US exchanges to bring down To bring their latency up and force people to not be able to deal with the changing market conditions Thereby creating an economic recession.

535
00:40:14,241 --> 00:40:14,783
Speaker 1: you could do that.

536
00:40:15,104 --> 00:40:28,170
Speaker 0: That's all generic and crazy But and I mean, I really can't get into specifics because I don't know and no one knows But I think that sort of warfare is kind of kind of be the future of war among industrialized powers.

537
00:40:28,211 --> 00:40:32,868
Speaker 1: Yeah back in the day So the stock exchange was just guys running around with paper which it largely is still.

538
00:40:32,908 --> 00:40:38,810
Speaker 1: but you know There's computers there now and you know, even when they had you know adding machines and such that you what could you do to the stock?

539
00:40:39,251 --> 00:40:44,505
Speaker 1: You could have a guy sneak in and start putting false papers around or or a bank.

540
00:40:44,725 --> 00:40:49,099
Speaker 0: you show up at a bank with you Know a bunch of faked purchase or what?

541
00:40:49,159 --> 00:40:50,122
Speaker 0: I don't know how that all works.

542
00:40:50,162 --> 00:40:51,106
Speaker 0: But yeah a bunch of faked.

543
00:40:51,146 --> 00:40:51,728
Speaker 0: Whatever's.

544
00:40:52,230 --> 00:40:59,662
Speaker 1: yeah You could you could try to do stuff like that sort of espionage type stuff But you couldn't like, you know Really attack the whole thing because it was just a bunch.

545
00:40:59,702 --> 00:41:01,309
Speaker 1: you could you could I guess you could try to blow it up.

546
00:41:01,711 --> 00:41:05,743
Speaker 0: Also, you couldn't attack it remotely over an internet.

547
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:06,344
Speaker 1: No.

548
00:41:06,385 --> 00:41:10,822
Speaker 1: Well, it's really hard to attack the New York You know, like the New York's access over the internet, but it's the same cuz.

549
00:41:10,842 --> 00:41:13,072
Speaker 1: a lot of things just shouldn't be on the internet Aren't?

550
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:23,689
Speaker 0: yeah, like Pete, but this is the one fallacy people always say oh in an IT war They'll shut down the stock exchange and they'll turn off machines in hospitals and they'll make dams open up.

551
00:41:24,251 --> 00:41:27,064
Speaker 0: Those things are generally not accessible by the internet.

552
00:41:27,245 --> 00:41:28,089
Speaker 0: that can't happen.

553
00:41:28,330 --> 00:41:32,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, remember the best security you can have is just unplug the cable.

554
00:41:32,150 --> 00:41:32,915
Speaker 1: You can have a computer.

555
00:41:33,016 --> 00:41:35,150
Speaker 1: that remember before we had computers before we had the internet.

556
00:41:35,732 --> 00:41:42,032
Speaker 1: There's no reason you can't have your computer on and not connect it to the internet with a wire and of any kind and no Wireless.

557
00:41:42,293 --> 00:41:43,939
Speaker 1: and how is someone gonna hack it?

558
00:41:43,959 --> 00:41:46,830
Speaker 1: They'd have to come in there and do something to it with their hands.

559
00:41:46,990 --> 00:41:48,233
Speaker 0: Yep, and there's.

560
00:41:48,454 --> 00:42:00,470
Speaker 0: there are parallel structures like internet 2 and the you know internet 3 that aren't as accessible as I guess Internet 1 and there are pipelines and methods of communicating that just aren't accessible to the outside.

561
00:42:00,611 --> 00:42:05,098
Speaker 1: We go to the hospital they put you in you know Like the emergency whatever and there's machines hooked up to you.

562
00:42:05,419 --> 00:42:06,523
Speaker 1: Those machines are computers.

563
00:42:07,005 --> 00:42:08,550
Speaker 1: They're probably not on the internet.

564
00:42:08,731 --> 00:42:12,295
Speaker 1: They might be on like the local hospital network But so that's it.

565
00:42:12,456 --> 00:42:16,790
Speaker 0: I guess what we're saying it around about ways that wall, you know, theoretically all these things can happen.

566
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:20,150
Speaker 0: They could attack the economic centers of a country electronically.

567
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:30,269
Speaker 0: realistically, it's still a very difficult thing to pull off and As a result, it's really not something that the average person should really care or worry about at all.

568
00:42:30,731 --> 00:42:36,510
Speaker 1: No, you really it's you really shouldn't worry about anything that they anything the news says you should be afraid of you probably shouldn't be.

569
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:39,159
Speaker 1: Well, unless they're like a gunman is loose.

570
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:47,323
Speaker 1: Well, okay your town or tornado warning now Hurricane coming next week or that broccoli ecolide.

571
00:42:47,584 --> 00:42:48,286
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's that.

572
00:42:48,326 --> 00:42:49,330
Speaker 1: Well, you shouldn't be afraid of that.

573
00:42:49,370 --> 00:42:50,655
Speaker 1: You just don't buy the broccoli.

574
00:42:50,776 --> 00:42:51,680
Speaker 0: Well, you should be afraid of it.

575
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:52,784
Speaker 0: If you just ate broccoli.

576
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:54,775
Speaker 0: That was bad broccoli All right.

577
00:42:54,795 --> 00:42:59,689
Speaker 0: Well, I guess being a good just call the doctor I'd be a little afraid when I went to the doctor like I ate the bad broccoli, dude.

578
00:43:01,771 --> 00:43:08,501
Speaker 1: Well, I guess since I wouldn't be afraid I guess I'd be more afraid if like I ate the bad broccoli days ago And I was having diarrhea already now.

579
00:43:09,204 --> 00:43:09,465
Speaker 0: I don't know.

580
00:43:09,485 --> 00:43:10,670
Speaker 0: There's no real moral to all this.

581
00:43:10,730 --> 00:43:12,649
Speaker 0: I mean I could go on a long diatribe about.

582
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:17,564
Speaker 0: Warfare is becoming abstract again And this is a good thing because it means less people being killed.

583
00:43:17,785 --> 00:43:22,306
Speaker 1: and but then again It could mean actually a lot of people being killed by someone typing in a room.

584
00:43:22,326 --> 00:43:32,025
Speaker 0: or then again it could mean a shockazooloo situation or a greece situation where Warfare becomes so abstract that it's meaningless and it's just a game.

585
00:43:32,367 --> 00:43:39,127
Speaker 0: and then someone like Germany or Prussia back in the day when they said what if we just invaded forget the rules?

586
00:43:39,167 --> 00:43:40,010
Speaker 0: What if we just invaded?

587
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:44,270
Speaker 0: What if we just fucking go there and then suddenly we go through the cycle?

588
00:43:44,270 --> 00:43:46,261
Speaker 1: They went there and I don't know.

589
00:43:46,844 --> 00:43:50,761
Speaker 0: All I know is that IT warfare is an interesting topic to debate about.

590
00:43:51,363 --> 00:43:53,190
Speaker 0: it's not something to worry about.

591
00:43:54,571 --> 00:43:56,164
Speaker 0: It's really all I can say.

592
00:43:56,184 --> 00:43:56,749
Speaker 0: beyond that.

593
00:43:57,251 --> 00:44:13,929
Speaker 1: yeah, I guess the point is is that you know you should as much as technology is super awesome and As much as you should use it as much as you can to make your life better and more efficient and easier in every Way and I encourage everyone in every organization to do so to the fullest extent that they can.

594
00:44:14,751 --> 00:44:16,770
Speaker 1: You should all probably a backup plan.

595
00:44:16,871 --> 00:44:25,670
Speaker 1: I mean, you know not a backup plan like oh no So what if the world ends but like, you know, can I continue existing and continue caring about my business inefficiently?

596
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:28,749
Speaker 1: You know if something happens like I don't know this power out for a few days?

597
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:46,684
Speaker 0: Yeah, and here's the thing in the IT world pretty much every important thing worth anything is So redundantly backed up ready to be available in case of all sorts of crazy disaster That it's not that big a concern.

598
00:44:46,744 --> 00:44:52,710
Speaker 0: most of these scenarios Represented were almost entirely theoretical and not likely.

599
00:44:53,252 --> 00:44:54,637
Speaker 1: Yeah things that are what's.

600
00:44:54,677 --> 00:44:56,222
Speaker 1: what kind of thing would be likely though?

601
00:44:56,242 --> 00:44:57,567
Speaker 1: that would be kind of big.

602
00:44:57,607 --> 00:45:03,370
Speaker 0: the one thing that is You could bring down a lot of things for consumers or for average people.

603
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:04,477
Speaker 1: You guitar you could.

604
00:45:04,578 --> 00:45:17,193
Speaker 1: if you if you target a specific Sort of service of some kind and you have a lot of resources at your disposal You can probably take it down, but at the same time if you're targeting it from China Well, the u.s.

605
00:45:17,233 --> 00:45:20,802
Speaker 0: Controls most of the internet connections in the world.

606
00:45:21,083 --> 00:45:30,970
Speaker 0: they can just stop that traffic coming pretty handily Yep, but maybe if they had an army of spam box, but spam box are used by script kiddies and spammers to send spam.

607
00:45:31,091 --> 00:45:38,110
Speaker 1: They're not used by China to attack your stuff No, but I mean someone could set up a bunch of zombies on old windows boxes all around the world.

608
00:45:38,272 --> 00:45:42,929
Speaker 0: Honestly other than you know The this crazy space warfare that I don't think we need to worry about right now.

609
00:45:43,512 --> 00:45:56,253
Speaker 0: The only really viable situation that I can foresee but then again I could be wrong But I don't think we're that wrong would be attacks against say general internet consumer infrastructure in order to cause general Economic slowdown.

610
00:45:56,835 --> 00:46:04,896
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if someone starts attacking like bring down DNS in the US or Google or Amazon Amazon would hurt quite a bit.

611
00:46:05,076 --> 00:46:08,730
Speaker 0: I mean it that sort of thing wouldn't be crippling but it would be very demoralizing.

612
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:10,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean think about you.

613
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:13,915
Speaker 1: take out Amazon you someone you might think okay Well, obviously Amazon's gonna be hurt.

614
00:46:13,955 --> 00:46:26,510
Speaker 1: Well, yes, but in addition, you know all those people making books Publishers Amazon sells everything, you know A to Z There's gonna be a lot of people who make stuff and sell a lot of products in Amazon.

615
00:46:26,610 --> 00:46:32,414
Speaker 0: We're gonna get hurt and the stock exchange to go way down and even if you know It comes back up in two days.

616
00:46:33,116 --> 00:46:47,090
Speaker 0: if then the evil Russians or whoever the enemy is at that time Just says yeah, that was us all cyber warfare style Then that scares a lot of people even though really the threat wasn't that bad at all.

617
00:46:47,592 --> 00:46:51,545
Speaker 1: yep, but a lot of you know, a lot of things can happen as a result of scariness.

618
00:46:51,987 --> 00:46:59,409
Speaker 1: because you know, like Greenspan said yeah, I cannot miss all about confidence and what people are thinking and not actually about anything else.
