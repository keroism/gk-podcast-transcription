Speaker 0: Cuz I'm so full of myself.

30
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:53,026
Speaker 0: So I call it a wine and cheese party and everyone thinks oh It's a wine and cheese party when really it's just us sitting around drinking wine and eating cheese.

31
00:01:53,327 --> 00:01:54,250
Speaker 1: I see what you did there.

32
00:01:55,672 --> 00:01:59,046
Speaker 0: See that's very relevant when we talk about what we're gonna talk about for the second half of the show.

33
00:01:59,508 --> 00:02:01,730
Speaker 1: Oh great This episode is such a throwaway.

34
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:04,949
Speaker 0: Whatever next week is gonna be even worse.

35
00:02:05,871 --> 00:02:07,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, don't listen next week.

36
00:02:07,074 --> 00:02:09,622
Speaker 0: It's gonna be don't listen until after Otacon in fact.

37
00:02:10,002 --> 00:02:11,588
Speaker 1: Yeah, then it's gonna be really really good.

38
00:02:11,789 --> 00:02:22,850
Speaker 0: Yes All right, well actually have some news, and this is a non tech non geek news Definitely a nerd news because it is a affliction that really seems to affect nerds in great propensity.

39
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:28,910
Speaker 0: Well it afflicts nerds who have a propensity for eating with a propensity of problems and a propensity of not moving.

40
00:02:29,613 --> 00:02:31,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that people who lead sedentary lifestyles.

41
00:02:32,283 --> 00:02:33,729
Speaker 0: the problem is that?

42
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:39,530
Speaker 0: Hospitals do not have the facilities to deal with really really fat people at all.

43
00:02:40,653 --> 00:02:51,955
Speaker 0: Now the article is funny because it even goes on that Really obese people not only do x-rays not penetrate their body whoa But whoa They can't.

44
00:02:52,056 --> 00:02:59,970
Speaker 0: even if they do get x-rays and MRIs to work They usually can't see otherwise commonly treatable problems because there's so much fat in the way.

45
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:00,853
Speaker 0: You just can't.

46
00:03:00,954 --> 00:03:01,215
Speaker 1: you know.

47
00:03:01,235 --> 00:03:04,167
Speaker 1: it's wondered like what if a fat guy needs.

48
00:03:04,408 --> 00:03:07,619
Speaker 1: I don't know His appendix taken out.

49
00:03:07,699 --> 00:03:09,530
Speaker 1: How do you get to the appendix?

50
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:13,690
Speaker 1: He's like cut him wide freaking open and dig through all this blob.

51
00:03:13,851 --> 00:03:18,369
Speaker 0: You know what you do whenever you have to operate on someone like that your liposuction him as part of whatever you do it.

52
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:20,277
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know.

53
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,342
Speaker 1: I don't know either.

54
00:03:21,603 --> 00:03:22,988
Speaker 1: all I know is the smart doctors.

55
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:24,175
Speaker 1: yesterday What did they say?

56
00:03:24,295 --> 00:03:24,718
Speaker 0: you know what?

57
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,563
Speaker 0: let me put it this way.

58
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:32,726
Speaker 0: This is a massive Massive hospital, this is a extremely well-known research hospital too and all the hospitals.

59
00:03:32,766 --> 00:03:34,210
Speaker 0: I work at are huge.

60
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:35,359
Speaker 0: I mean, they're New York City.

61
00:03:35,399 --> 00:03:36,690
Speaker 0: They treat lots of people.

62
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:41,063
Speaker 0: They don't even really have the facilities to deal with these kinds of people.

63
00:03:41,123 --> 00:03:42,869
Speaker 0: they probably would send them to the Bronx Zoo.

64
00:03:43,852 --> 00:03:45,075
Speaker 1: Were any of the doctors fat?

65
00:03:45,657 --> 00:03:46,559
Speaker 0: no there is.

66
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,487
Speaker 0: not a single doctor I've spoken to was obese.

67
00:03:49,728 --> 00:03:51,768
Speaker 0: some of them were overweight But that's because they were old.

68
00:03:53,033 --> 00:03:57,285
Speaker 0: I mean, there's a big difference between overweight and obese and morbidly obese.

69
00:03:57,505 --> 00:03:59,230
Speaker 0: This is not even talking about obese people.

70
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:02,270
Speaker 0: This is the morbidly obese as in more than you know.

71
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:06,487
Speaker 1: I don't know 400 pounds as in at least the Bronx Zoo is right there.

72
00:04:06,608 --> 00:04:08,354
Speaker 0: Yeah Now you think I'm kidding.

73
00:04:08,755 --> 00:04:26,422
Speaker 0: they really do send people to the zoo because the zoo's have to do doctoring on things like Elephants and walruses, so they're right not so lots horses Ryan ocelot say Lol rofl rofl lol.

74
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:30,955
Speaker 1: exactly That's right, that's a lot that money.

75
00:04:31,377 --> 00:04:31,939
Speaker 0: No.

76
00:04:32,059 --> 00:04:32,601
Speaker 0: It's funny.

77
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:38,887
Speaker 0: in regards to the second half of the show oh You know what else they have at the zoo, what do they have at the zoo?

78
00:04:39,248 --> 00:04:44,508
Speaker 0: monkeys Okay, okay enough inside jokes enough enough whatnot.

79
00:04:45,312 --> 00:04:51,988
Speaker 0: But they in all serious silly Thursday will send patients who are really fat to the zoo.

80
00:04:52,009 --> 00:05:02,105
Speaker 0: and At one point someone this wasn't here this was somewhere else in the country someone sued for the humiliation of being sent to the zoo And I don't remember the outcome of the lawsuit.

81
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:09,067
Speaker 1: if I was the other lawyer I would say you can't sue someone else if you humiliate yourself, and then I would sit down.

82
00:05:09,107 --> 00:05:10,050
Speaker 1: I'd be like I rest.

83
00:05:13,732 --> 00:05:14,658
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you got a news.

84
00:05:14,718 --> 00:05:15,343
Speaker 0: we I think we got.

85
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,390
Speaker 1: I got a shit news.

86
00:05:16,611 --> 00:05:19,582
Speaker 0: I think we got to get past the front bit before we just lose it.

87
00:05:20,325 --> 00:05:26,016
Speaker 1: so tomorrow Friday Which is probably today because a lot of people listen to this on Friday It seems the day after.

88
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:28,386
Speaker 0: yeah, it seems that most people listen to an episode the day after.

89
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:32,159
Speaker 0: but I'll say this This is kind of weird kind of an off off-topic bit.

90
00:05:32,781 --> 00:05:38,429
Speaker 0: it seems that almost every single episode We have is downloaded a couple times every single day.

91
00:05:39,155 --> 00:05:41,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, like every episode.

92
00:05:42,052 --> 00:05:43,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, okay?

93
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,227
Speaker 1: Tomorrow Friday July 28th is sis admin day.

94
00:05:49,247 --> 00:05:57,721
Speaker 0: now I would have been a lot more excited about this if I was still a sis admin because I'll bet the people I worked with Nominated me at least as a joke because I wasn't.

95
00:05:58,183 --> 00:05:59,690
Speaker 0: I was good, but I was also an asshole.

96
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:03,641
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm just generally against all these kind of holidays.

97
00:06:03,701 --> 00:06:06,790
Speaker 0: Oh you mean like Secretary's Day or bosses day or Valentine's Day or Christmas?

98
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:12,198
Speaker 1: Yeah, it seems like they just keep making up holidays of day Which isn't a joke to sell cards and shit.

99
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:17,658
Speaker 1: and while sis admin day seems to be all dirty and cool It seems like it's just wait a minute.

100
00:06:17,698 --> 00:06:20,510
Speaker 0: wait a minute now if you're against these sorts of holidays.

101
00:06:21,071 --> 00:06:23,558
Speaker 0: What of the International Day of Slayer?

102
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:25,724
Speaker 0: what of talk like a pirate day?

103
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:26,446
Speaker 0: what I was.

104
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:27,589
Speaker 0: what if no pants day?

105
00:06:27,649 --> 00:06:33,508
Speaker 1: those Holidays were not invented by card companies true, but or do they sell cards for those?

106
00:06:33,628 --> 00:06:34,110
Speaker 0: well wait a minute.

107
00:06:34,271 --> 00:06:36,889
Speaker 0: Do people sell cards for sis admin day if anything?

108
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,793
Speaker 1: I think they might.

109
00:06:38,236 --> 00:06:40,648
Speaker 0: I don't know cuz I can't see they might be getting ready to.

110
00:06:40,668 --> 00:06:42,553
Speaker 0: I Don't know cuz.

111
00:06:42,594 --> 00:06:45,850
Speaker 0: I think there's a big market for talk like a pirate day memorabilia.

112
00:06:46,493 --> 00:06:49,144
Speaker 1: Well you buy it from that talk like a pirate day official website.

113
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,089
Speaker 0: No no it's got to be bootleg you know.

114
00:06:57,777 --> 00:07:05,745
Speaker 1: So if anyone can find a sis admin day or happy sis admin day card I don't know even if it's just a flash thing on a website.

115
00:07:05,765 --> 00:07:06,910
Speaker 1: You know those email cards.

116
00:07:07,756 --> 00:07:09,047
Speaker 1: I'd like to see that now.

117
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:15,889
Speaker 0: at IBM We had an award that we would pass around and it's not too related, but it's related enough, and it's a funny story now.

118
00:07:17,092 --> 00:07:25,101
Speaker 0: We I mean we were all admins of a whole bunch of really important servers and We were also really not given enough money to deal with everything.

119
00:07:25,342 --> 00:07:33,618
Speaker 0: and because we played so fast and loose we often would break things or screw things up and Morale was really low in IBM for a lot of reasons.

120
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:39,549
Speaker 0: so our boss is part of this bosses initiative where this was handed down From way above to her and she handed off to us.

121
00:07:40,312 --> 00:07:48,630
Speaker 0: We had to do this kind of team building thing where we'd make some sort of department award and whenever someone did something on You were supposed to give it to them and to be this rotating thing.

122
00:07:49,371 --> 00:08:10,066
Speaker 0: so she left and we sat around and we decided we were gonna make an award all right and Someone welded a bunch of old token ring cards together And it was the dumb shit award and you gave it to someone who fucked up And it was and it would sit there until someone did something worse than whatever you just did And it lasted a few months until she figured out what we were using it for.

123
00:08:10,146 --> 00:08:10,969
Speaker 0: she made us get rid of it.

124
00:08:12,692 --> 00:08:19,849
Speaker 0: I got it once because I wasn't paying attention, and I plugged a 220 line into a 100 10 volt power supply.

125
00:08:20,632 --> 00:08:21,656
Speaker 0: It wasn't even my server.

126
00:08:21,897 --> 00:08:29,425
Speaker 0: I was installing someone else's server, and I plug it in and it goes BAM And it's like sparks hit me and it knocked me back.

127
00:08:29,465 --> 00:08:39,830
Speaker 0: and then smoke came out And I'm sitting there and the guy says you okay, and I said I'm fine And I stood up and I said you got another power supply.

128
00:08:41,553 --> 00:08:41,825
Speaker 0: Why?

129
00:08:45,772 --> 00:08:56,075
Speaker 0: The other guy who got it after me He actually was in the data center, and he was working on a completely useless server that no one cared about While he was working on it.

130
00:08:56,116 --> 00:09:00,590
Speaker 0: He bumped into the power cable for an extremely critical server, and he unplugged it.

131
00:09:00,951 --> 00:09:06,099
Speaker 0: He didn't unplug it enough to unplug like it didn't look like it was unplugged And it was still on.

132
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:11,323
Speaker 0: like you know I get a computer that screwed up The lights still on, but it's not doing anything anymore.

133
00:09:11,886 --> 00:09:16,644
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, oh So suddenly all the calls start coming in about.

134
00:09:16,664 --> 00:09:17,388
Speaker 0: you know something's wrong.

135
00:09:17,408 --> 00:09:17,850
Speaker 0: something's wrong.

136
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:22,189
Speaker 0: And here's all the phones going off, and he's thinking man something's going wrong somewhere.

137
00:09:23,553 --> 00:09:25,029
Speaker 0: Luckily, I'm working on a shit server.

138
00:09:25,753 --> 00:09:26,415
Speaker 0: Someone walks back.

139
00:09:26,455 --> 00:09:27,178
Speaker 0: He's like hey.

140
00:09:27,198 --> 00:09:28,724
Speaker 0: Did you just do anything back here?

141
00:09:28,865 --> 00:09:35,950
Speaker 0: He's like no You're the only one back here by the time he got to his office the award was just sitting there on his chair.

142
00:09:38,612 --> 00:09:40,264
Speaker 0: All right, you know I get like 10 more of those stories.

143
00:09:40,324 --> 00:09:41,170
Speaker 0: I'll save him for another day.

144
00:09:43,152 --> 00:09:45,864
Speaker 0: That award was beautiful, and I can't believe they made us get rid of it.

145
00:09:46,005 --> 00:09:48,127
Speaker 1: if I ever started company I'll know to have one of those.

158
00:10:43,441 --> 00:10:46,519

159
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:49,792
Speaker 0: Yeah I really wanted.

160
00:10:50,033 --> 00:10:56,916
Speaker 0: I want to say stuff about this But it's your thing of the day because you call dibs on it, so you get to describe call dibs on this Absolutely amazing thing of the day.

Speaker 0: yes This is probably going to go down in history is one of our best things of the day.

Speaker 1: probably now people have seen You know fights in hockey at least I hope you've seen fights in hockey.

163
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,469

164
00:11:11,014 --> 00:11:20,330
Speaker 1: yes well Here is a fight between the Ottawa Senators and the Philadelphia Flyers two teams known for their I don't know ruffian age.

165
00:11:20,531 --> 00:11:20,813
Speaker 0: Yes.

166
00:11:20,954 --> 00:11:21,900
Speaker 0: I mean roughhousing.

167
00:11:22,282 --> 00:11:25,014
Speaker 0: They are teams that rely especially the Flyers.

168
00:11:25,074 --> 00:11:26,420
Speaker 1: the Flyers beat the shit out of me.

169
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:26,901
Speaker 0: They relied.

170
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:27,122
Speaker 0: have.

171
00:11:27,142 --> 00:11:31,073
Speaker 0: let's see the thing is in every other sport you call these people thugs or assholes.

172
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:31,735
Speaker 0: in hockey.

173
00:11:31,996 --> 00:11:33,219
Speaker 0: They're called enforcers.

174
00:11:34,701 --> 00:11:36,363
Speaker 0: I Just want to note that.

175
00:11:36,644 --> 00:11:38,811
Speaker 0: notice how Scott didn't say to flaky players.

176
00:11:38,871 --> 00:11:40,015
Speaker 0: He said to hockey team.

177
00:11:40,436 --> 00:11:41,580
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, yes, yes.

178
00:11:42,646 --> 00:11:44,558
Speaker 1: So what happens in this video is?

179
00:11:45,581 --> 00:11:46,999
Speaker 1: There's a you know slight.

180
00:11:48,325 --> 00:11:49,195
Speaker 1: How do we say?

181
00:11:50,280 --> 00:12:06,457
Speaker 1: I was guffal a disagreement a scuffle between two players Yeah, and they get into a nice good old hockey fight with some haymakers and whoa craziness, and then you know some other players start fighting And eventually everyone on the Isis fight Even the goalies.

182
00:12:06,538 --> 00:12:15,113
Speaker 0: now I gotta say that is fucked up because I've never seen a goalie Do anything to another goalie or involved in a fight ever.

183
00:12:15,193 --> 00:12:20,085
Speaker 1: I've seen a goalie hit a guy a couple times But I have never seen Two goalies fighting.

184
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:23,857
Speaker 1: now the thing is no one else is gonna fight with a goalie except the other team's goalie.

185
00:12:23,917 --> 00:12:29,620
Speaker 1: because well He's got a zillion pads, and you've got much less pads, and he's gonna kick the shit out of you.

186
00:12:29,901 --> 00:12:34,173
Speaker 0: also, I think there's the thing that you don't want to be the guy who hurt a goalie.

187
00:12:34,434 --> 00:12:38,547
Speaker 1: and also if you get into a Fight with the goalie you might not get.

188
00:12:38,648 --> 00:12:42,996
Speaker 1: just get a fighting penalty you might get a goalie interference penalty yep And all sorts of trouble.

189
00:12:43,138 --> 00:12:46,400
Speaker 1: yeah It's not good to fight with a goalie mainly because you don't want to die.

190
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,016
Speaker 1: But I mean that two goalies fight each other.

191
00:12:49,197 --> 00:12:49,740
Speaker 1: holy shit.

192
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:50,503
Speaker 0: I mean the.

193
00:12:50,643 --> 00:13:03,531
Speaker 0: until I saw this video the biggest hockey fight I'd ever seen was in an odd add a minor league game Between the some team in Michigan and some other team from somewhere useless new teams and it was the Detroit Falcons.

194
00:13:03,571 --> 00:13:05,839
Speaker 0: that was the name of the team and I don't know who they were playing.

195
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:15,319
Speaker 0: but after they get the game ended and There was some fighting going on to the whole game and suddenly both teams just rush each other And there's a brawl and even some of the audience got involved.

196
00:13:15,793 --> 00:13:25,280
Speaker 0: Yeah But despite that the only people on the ice not fighting Were the two goalies who were on the other side of the ice by themselves standing next to each other laughing their asses off.

197
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:28,113
Speaker 1: That's what goalies do now in this video though.

198
00:13:28,174 --> 00:13:29,440
Speaker 1: I don't know what caused this fight.

199
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:33,051
Speaker 1: It might have been you know some name-calling going on before the fight.

200
00:13:33,452 --> 00:13:38,920
Speaker 1: there might have been some you know your mom jokes going around But yeah, there was a big hockey fight.

201
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:45,600
Speaker 1: So eventually the refs clear up the fight many minutes later many minutes later, and they start playing hockey again.

202
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:49,073
Speaker 1: Now of course all the fighting players were into bucks.

203
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:50,920
Speaker 1: They put them in the box for two minutes.

204
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:52,608
Speaker 0: That's what they do for four minutes.

205
00:13:52,648 --> 00:13:53,050
Speaker 1: Who knows?

206
00:13:53,111 --> 00:13:54,678
Speaker 1: yeah, maybe ten God knows.

207
00:13:54,839 --> 00:13:54,919
Speaker 1: um.

208
00:13:55,372 --> 00:14:04,380
Speaker 0: so After the hockey game starts again Two guys immediately start fighting like literally the guy drops the puck one guy jumps the other guy, and they start fighting.

209
00:14:05,142 --> 00:14:13,079
Speaker 1: So apparently you know these guys must have been you know in the the benches You know yelling curses at each other while the fights were going on.

210
00:14:13,442 --> 00:14:19,691
Speaker 1: They they get their chance to come out on the ice and they start fighting And everyone else on the ice starts fighting.

211
00:14:19,832 --> 00:14:23,286
Speaker 0: it ends up being like three on three hockey And there's no one on either band.

212
00:14:23,326 --> 00:14:28,139
Speaker 1: so after a whole you know they start the game fighting they stop the game They start the game fighting, okay?

213
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,725
Speaker 1: They start the game again.

214
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:37,380
Speaker 1: There's like three players left on each team on the ice and the goalies and The benches are pretty much empty.

215
00:14:37,581 --> 00:14:39,708
Speaker 1: There's like one player and the coach at each bench.

216
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:45,510
Speaker 0: now the crowd is just a sea of standing people screaming as loud as they Can and the three-on-three hockey.

217
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,080
Speaker 1: they drop the puck and they start fighting?

218
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,122
Speaker 1: I Think.

219
00:14:53,262 --> 00:14:58,880
Speaker 1: I think what the story was is that the game was basically almost over so they didn't have anything to lose by fighting.

220
00:14:59,303 --> 00:15:01,579
Speaker 1: So they all just let loose with everything they had.

221
00:15:04,162 --> 00:15:07,075
Speaker 1: If you see one hockey fight ever see this one.

222
00:15:07,195 --> 00:15:11,456
Speaker 1: if you see two hockey fights All right, and right this one and all right all right all right all right.

223
00:15:11,496 --> 00:15:14,020
Speaker 0: well I'll make it a thing of the day during hockey fight week.

224
00:15:14,262 --> 00:15:15,860
Speaker 1: I think we might have made it a thing of day in the past.

225
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,689
Speaker 0: I'll make it a thing of the day again if I have to.

226
00:15:17,709 --> 00:15:22,313
Speaker 1: all right all right and right and right and right and right Right right all right all right.

227
00:15:22,334 --> 00:15:23,078
Speaker 0: I got a thing of the day.

228
00:15:23,934 --> 00:15:27,818
Speaker 0: Okay Now this is a very serious video.

229
00:15:28,885 --> 00:15:35,400
Speaker 0: No Actually, I did kind of is it's a video that we found kind of randomly, and then we found a better video of it.

230
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:47,739
Speaker 0: I'm linking to that one of James Randi of the famed James Randi educational foundation totally debunking Uri Geller the famous guy who pretended to bend spoons and pretended he had psychic powers.

231
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:59,260
Speaker 0: and It shows when this guy was on the Johnny Carson show and Johnny Johnny Hated these people as much as James Randi as much as Houdini as much as Penn and Teller as much as me as much as Scott.

232
00:16:00,122 --> 00:16:03,232
Speaker 0: He absolutely hated them and Uri Geller was gonna be on his show.

233
00:16:03,292 --> 00:16:07,140
Speaker 0: so he calls up James Randi because you know he's a magician And James Randi's a magician.

234
00:16:07,321 --> 00:16:09,607
Speaker 0: And he said how can I get this guy?

235
00:16:10,109 --> 00:16:11,373
Speaker 0: and James gave him a bunch of advice.

236
00:16:11,413 --> 00:16:19,359
Speaker 0: and then the video shows Uri Geller Completely failing to do all of his so-called magic bullshit on the show and getting really angry about it.

237
00:16:20,201 --> 00:16:25,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also as a nice bonus James Randi shows you exactly how you and your home can do all of his tricks.

238
00:16:27,061 --> 00:16:35,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, what it really comes down to is there are people in this world who are magicians And they do magic tricks, and they say watch me do magic tricks whoo You know.

239
00:16:35,582 --> 00:16:39,239
Speaker 1: and they hey pull rabbits out of hats and you know that they did it with like a rabbit up the sleeve.

240
00:16:39,259 --> 00:16:41,168
Speaker 1: or But you know they.

241
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:44,000
Speaker 1: they don't tell you what it was just so they can amaze you and entertain you.

242
00:16:44,543 --> 00:16:52,019
Speaker 1: There are other people who do the exact same thing Except they tell you that it's actually magic, and if you're stupid you believe them.

243
00:16:52,882 --> 00:17:02,275
Speaker 1: I mean what if I was David Copperfield and instead of saying I'm about to do a trick and then I fly around I said I can freakin fly join my wacky religion.

244
00:17:02,335 --> 00:17:03,849
Speaker 1: Why - Twa.

245
00:17:06,685 --> 00:17:20,797
Speaker 0: And those people are bad I mean just if you've never we talked about James Randi a lot you might notice that we even have a category on the website Called Randi r-a-n-d-i and that category will show up whenever we talk about something that is bullshit.

246
00:17:21,078 --> 00:17:23,656
Speaker 0: Yes bulls hit bulls hit.

247
00:17:25,622 --> 00:17:29,560
Speaker 0: And also as an aside to that for anyone who lives near us you know New York City.

248
00:17:30,242 --> 00:17:40,020
Speaker 0: There's a good chance that on Halloween Penn Gillette and teller and Michael Godot are going to be in the city for a spectacular monkey Tuesday to do.

249
00:17:41,265 --> 00:17:46,499
Speaker 0: Now I can guarantee Absolutely guarantee that if that happens geek nights will be there.

250
00:17:47,001 --> 00:17:51,030
Speaker 0: Absolute guarantee and anyone who lives anywhere near New York City should also be there.

251
00:17:53,920 --> 00:18:05,200
Speaker 0: Anyway now it's time for our very first hate mail, holy crap We I remember I read it and I the first thing I thought was there's no way this is real.

252
00:18:05,261 --> 00:18:07,300
Speaker 0: The first thing he does is accuse us of being gay.

253
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:15,420
Speaker 1: So we got a sort of a hate mail, but later he calls it an irritation mail.

254
00:18:15,925 --> 00:18:17,140
Speaker 1: But that's not the point.

255
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:25,772
Speaker 1: The point is is that we're gonna turn almost the whole episode into this email Because there are a lot of tangents we can take from it and it's entertaining.

256
00:18:26,474 --> 00:18:31,580
Speaker 1: and I think we said at some point The first time we get a hate mail will be all crazy about it.

257
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:33,179
Speaker 1: So here you and we have nothing better to do.

258
00:18:33,422 --> 00:18:34,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, not nothing at all.

259
00:18:35,165 --> 00:18:38,860
Speaker 1: And even if you don't like this episode It's incredibly entertaining for us to make this episode.

260
00:18:38,987 --> 00:18:42,040
Speaker 0: Yes As you might be able to tell them the fact that we can barely keep a straight face.

261
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:45,073
Speaker 1: So here's two middle fingers to you if you think this episode sucks.

262
00:18:45,435 --> 00:18:46,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's all you geek back haters.

263
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:47,926
Speaker 0: Here's a whole geek back episode.

264
00:18:47,986 --> 00:18:51,020
Speaker 1: All right, so I'm gonna read the original email because it's not that long.

265
00:18:51,121 --> 00:18:52,166
Speaker 1: I'll try to read it quickly.

266
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:54,960
Speaker 0: Well, we'll have to read the second one because that's well, okay.

267
00:18:55,000 --> 00:19:04,720
Speaker 1: So first he sent us an email and a few things about the email were broken, but I replied and Then he sent us the same email again with all that was corrected.

268
00:19:05,142 --> 00:19:07,838
Speaker 1: So obviously he clicked the send button a little too soon.

269
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:11,397
Speaker 0: now I found it interesting that he changed some of the wording between the two drafts.

270
00:19:11,839 --> 00:19:14,349
Speaker 1: Yeah I'll give him the benefit of the doubt and read the second one.

271
00:19:14,550 --> 00:19:17,040
Speaker 1: All right, the guy's name is is store.

272
00:19:17,241 --> 00:19:19,288
Speaker 1: I guess I store is to our.

273
00:19:19,308 --> 00:19:21,818
Speaker 1: I guess he's not gonna give us a real name.

274
00:19:22,219 --> 00:19:27,006
Speaker 0: Oh That was barely relevant, okay.

275
00:19:27,588 --> 00:19:27,909
Speaker 1: Okay.

276
00:19:28,430 --> 00:19:29,414
Speaker 1: Here's the email.

277
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:33,407
Speaker 1: the subject of the email is How not to suck it.

278
00:19:33,427 --> 00:19:34,213
Speaker 1: podcast it.

279
00:19:34,293 --> 00:19:43,769
Speaker 0: how to not suck it podcast Which is interesting because I saw incoming links to in our forum to a thread we had called just that Yeah that had one post in it.

280
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:46,440
Speaker 0: It's an ass old thread that no one read or did it.

281
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,679
Speaker 1: I don't think has anything to do with this.

282
00:19:47,961 --> 00:19:51,132
Speaker 0: I don't know because it came from Gmail and Yahoo and a bunch of other.

283
00:19:51,152 --> 00:19:56,846
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever anyway, so anyway The Guy says okay.

284
00:19:57,007 --> 00:19:57,611
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

285
00:19:57,852 --> 00:20:00,484
Speaker 1: Okay, you guys don't suck You're two idiots.

286
00:20:00,624 --> 00:20:03,092
Speaker 1: arguing shtick can be fairly entertaining.

287
00:20:03,332 --> 00:20:05,820
Speaker 1: In fact, that's sort of how I described the podcast to others.

288
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:06,863
Speaker 0: This is great right here.

289
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:09,010
Speaker 1: It's called geek nights.

290
00:20:09,332 --> 00:20:10,355
Speaker 1: It's two gay guys.

291
00:20:10,535 --> 00:20:11,820
Speaker 1: Not that there's anything wrong with that.

292
00:20:12,281 --> 00:20:19,253
Speaker 1: I think that they're together, but I'm not sure who are exceedingly average at best, but think they're bright Arguing about games and tech.

293
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:19,978
Speaker 1: It's kind of funny.

294
00:20:20,929 --> 00:20:25,085
Speaker 1: Okay now First thing we're not gay.

295
00:20:25,728 --> 00:20:28,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know how else I can refute that.

296
00:20:28,798 --> 00:20:33,054
Speaker 1: We're not Yeah, we put the penises in the vagina.

297
00:20:33,174 --> 00:20:34,300
Speaker 1: Well not in the butts.

298
00:20:35,740 --> 00:20:37,210
Speaker 1: The butts say do not enter on them.

299
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:41,529
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean in all seriousness I've been dating a wonderful girl for like three years now.

300
00:20:42,071 --> 00:20:48,506
Speaker 0: and Scott while he is not currently dating anyone No I don't have anything to follow that with yeah.

301
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:52,198
Speaker 1: Oh and cuz some people seem confused especially his store.

302
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,808
Speaker 0: I am Scott I am rim and this is geek nights.

303
00:20:54,868 --> 00:20:55,913
Speaker 1: Don't be confused.

304
00:20:56,174 --> 00:20:57,560
Speaker 0: I think we're gonna add a. I'm rim.

305
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,317
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, especially since we seem to be getting a lot of new listeners at somewhat frightening rates.

306
00:21:02,478 --> 00:21:03,060
Speaker 1: Yep, okay.

307
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:05,227
Speaker 1: And also how come?

308
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:11,071
Speaker 1: whenever anyone says, you know, oh he's gay They always have to say not there's anything wrong with that like by default.

309
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:16,398
Speaker 1: You're somehow you know a homophobe Anti-gay person and you have to say you're not.

310
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:25,756
Speaker 0: yeah I mean to me by default Being gay is cool And if it only if someone goes out of their way to express to me that they are somehow against gayness What I even consider that they would be.

311
00:21:25,797 --> 00:21:26,100
Speaker 0: that way

312
00:21:26,143 --> 00:21:46,880
Speaker 1: Yeah like if I say You know you can tell unless there's something wrong with your brain by the way Someone says something or the way someone word something whether you're saying, you know now rims gay prim is so gay Rims a fucking faggot, you know You can tell if someone is against gay people or is just using the word gay as in yeah, they're gay.

313
00:21:47,345 --> 00:21:48,400
Speaker 1: That's what they are now.

314
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:53,169
Speaker 0: The funny thing is he won't let this go and in the follow-up emails Which I'll touch on he won't.

315
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:54,960
Speaker 0: he won't accept the fact that we're not gay.

316
00:21:55,282 --> 00:21:57,234
Speaker 1: Anyway, let's continue with his email.

317
00:21:57,375 --> 00:22:02,055
Speaker 1: All right, of course There are a few things you might want to address and here's where it sort of becomes a hate mail.

318
00:22:02,557 --> 00:22:05,126
Speaker 1: number one Learn to pronounce preface.

319
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:06,511
Speaker 1: It's starting to get irritating.

320
00:22:06,571 --> 00:22:07,113
Speaker 1: That's rim.

321
00:22:07,274 --> 00:22:08,518
Speaker 0: I pronounced shit wrong all the time.

322
00:22:08,538 --> 00:22:09,160
Speaker 0: What do you want from me?

323
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:09,742
Speaker 1: There you go.

324
00:22:09,762 --> 00:22:10,244
Speaker 1: You admitted it.

325
00:22:10,264 --> 00:22:10,585
Speaker 1: We're good.

326
00:22:11,007 --> 00:22:12,314
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course you do too captain.

327
00:22:12,334 --> 00:22:12,836
Speaker 0: Titan.

328
00:22:13,017 --> 00:22:16,534
Speaker 1: number two Stop pronouncing pun and teh out loud.

329
00:22:16,554 --> 00:22:24,329
Speaker 1: No boond awesome Three you're not hardcore board gamers.

330
00:22:24,369 --> 00:22:24,711
Speaker 1: Give it up.

331
00:22:24,731 --> 00:22:36,777
Speaker 0: All right before you read the A B and C of this point I just want to note that anyone who ever says that someone else is not hardcore That's like the whiny kid who likes Sony who says you Nintendo gamers aren't hard car enough.

332
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:38,819
Speaker 0: I mean seriously.

333
00:22:39,584 --> 00:22:46,605
Speaker 1: Hey You get rules wrong on a regular basis which He never really answered.

334
00:22:46,646 --> 00:22:47,709
Speaker 0: that because we tried to go.

335
00:22:47,749 --> 00:22:48,351
Speaker 1: we're gonna I'm gonna.

336
00:22:48,813 --> 00:22:53,108
Speaker 1: I did reply to this email to add more meat And I'm gonna go to that eventually.

337
00:22:53,208 --> 00:22:54,795
Speaker 0: Well, you said you wanted me to read that part.

338
00:22:54,995 --> 00:22:55,196
Speaker 1: Yeah.

339
00:22:55,337 --> 00:22:56,160
Speaker 0: Okay, you want to read it?

340
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:56,982
Speaker 0: You can okay.

341
00:22:57,263 --> 00:23:03,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, but be your game analysis is naive at best and sometimes degenerates to pure new business.

342
00:23:04,081 --> 00:23:05,162
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm really curious about that.

343
00:23:05,262 --> 00:23:07,826
Speaker 1: one see your strategies are laughable.

344
00:23:08,006 --> 00:23:18,380
Speaker 1: I imagine that's mostly a result of a and B But you get owned by anyone with even the slightest modicum of intelligence.

345
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:24,803
Speaker 0: Well, I guess the only people who actually beat us on any sort of regular basis are each other and by each other I mean the whole front row crew.

346
00:23:24,844 --> 00:23:29,840
Speaker 1: Yeah for you are not skilled arguers, especially the slow talking one.

347
00:23:30,041 --> 00:23:32,540
Speaker 0: I assume he means you because I tend to get excited.

348
00:23:32,726 --> 00:23:37,312
Speaker 1: Yeah You do realize that repeating the same things over and over isn't a valid argument.

349
00:23:37,693 --> 00:23:39,999
Speaker 1: what you to engage in is rhetoric not argument.

350
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:47,200
Speaker 0: now One I do often engage in rhetoric because it's very useful, but I don't think we have ever actually had an argument on geek nights.

351
00:23:47,280 --> 00:23:48,185
Speaker 0: It's all been in the forum.

352
00:23:48,245 --> 00:23:49,412
Speaker 1: Yeah, not a real one.

353
00:23:49,492 --> 00:23:51,000
Speaker 0: Anyway, yeah, it's hard.

354
00:23:51,321 --> 00:23:59,793
Speaker 0: You can't really have an argument unless you have you know multiple sides and you actually argue it out and debate it out Which we usually don't do between each other.

355
00:23:59,833 --> 00:24:03,990
Speaker 1: at first you have to say what you know What are you arguing about and then you got to prepare?

356
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:04,411
Speaker 1: Yeah.

357
00:24:04,772 --> 00:24:07,442
Speaker 1: Okay five the one with the higher pitch voice That's me.

358
00:24:07,502 --> 00:24:10,155
Speaker 1: I assume not the one that sounds like he's stoned constantly.

359
00:24:10,175 --> 00:24:11,199
Speaker 0: I assume that's you.

360
00:24:11,722 --> 00:24:12,024
Speaker 1: I don't know.

361
00:24:12,326 --> 00:24:14,660
Speaker 1: You might want to cut back on the self back padding.

362
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:16,165
Speaker 0: What can I say?

363
00:24:16,225 --> 00:24:17,431
Speaker 0: geek nights is freaking awesome.

364
00:24:17,834 --> 00:24:18,779
Speaker 0: I am an ubermensch.

365
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:20,726
Speaker 0: Scott is a god among men.

366
00:24:20,987 --> 00:24:24,320
Speaker 0: the front row crew are our veritable Adonis sigh.

367
00:24:25,622 --> 00:24:30,180
Speaker 1: It was amusing at first but over time your inflated sense of self-worth is starting to get irritating.

368
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:39,260
Speaker 1: I suppose that the company you keep has resulted in this false conception of your ability Now that right there the land of the blind the one-eyed man and all that right there is a low blow.

369
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,375
Speaker 0: It's one thing to call a man egotistical which I am.

370
00:24:42,656 --> 00:24:43,098
Speaker 1: you are.

371
00:24:43,159 --> 00:24:54,040
Speaker 1: indeed I'm not and it's it's good to see that someone else agrees points it out and doesn't like it because sometimes I feel like I'm Granted Scott you're kind of full of yourself - not as much as me not even not even close.

372
00:24:54,100 --> 00:24:58,560
Speaker 1: No, see the thing is is I my full of selfness is truth?

373
00:25:01,221 --> 00:25:01,569
Speaker 1: It's like.

374
00:25:03,882 --> 00:25:08,098
Speaker 0: The only reason I'm laughing is because all the people we know are gonna yell at both of us about that.

375
00:25:08,158 --> 00:25:12,158
Speaker 1: whatever It's I say I am as awesome as I actually am.

376
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:15,271
Speaker 1: rim says that he is more awesome than he actually is.

377
00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:26,320
Speaker 0: the worst thing is it's because I think my propensity to exaggerate in order to tell good stories that Everything I do is awesome to me and everything my friends do is awesome to me because I'm not even just full of myself.

378
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,123
Speaker 0: I'm full of my friends.

379
00:25:27,163 --> 00:25:32,805
Speaker 0: like I'll talk geek nights up crazily or if someone of my friends does a podcast or something I'll be like, it's awesome.

380
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:37,160
Speaker 1: It's the best thing I've ever heard like five minutes ago where you said we're getting listeners.

381
00:25:37,221 --> 00:25:39,080
Speaker 1: You know some insane rate.

382
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,266
Speaker 0: Actually, we are because we we've.

383
00:25:42,028 --> 00:25:46,200
Speaker 0: I can show you the graph that actually it's becoming a square as opposed to a linear.

384
00:25:46,382 --> 00:25:47,539
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the wrong number.

385
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:54,371
Speaker 1: linear Numbers are still not increasing exponentially yet.

386
00:25:54,873 --> 00:26:01,599
Speaker 1: No, but the trend is and I trend is yeah I've extrapolated a line using so we aren't actually acquiring listeners and it's not in great yet.

387
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:04,074
Speaker 1: Yeah, we are just acquiring listeners at a normal rate.

388
00:26:04,255 --> 00:26:04,536
Speaker 0: I'm fine.

389
00:26:04,557 --> 00:26:07,305
Speaker 0: We're To speak the perfect truth.

390
00:26:07,546 --> 00:26:10,657
Speaker 0: We are gaining listeners at an increasingly increasing rate.

391
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:11,580
Speaker 1: We are indeed.

392
00:26:12,163 --> 00:26:15,660
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point I want to get to is not that you know, it calls me egotistical.

393
00:26:15,701 --> 00:26:16,338
Speaker 0: I'm fine with that.

394
00:26:16,784 --> 00:26:23,940
Speaker 0: It's kind of a low blow though that He basically seems to say that the reason I am is because my friends are all stupid such as our friends.

395
00:26:27,142 --> 00:26:29,432
Speaker 0: Thing is the people who are actually stupid aren't really our friends.

396
00:26:29,612 --> 00:26:38,439
Speaker 0: No, honestly in all seriousness I would say that the members of the front row crew all of us are some of the smartest and most awesome people I know.

397
00:26:39,261 --> 00:26:39,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, and

398
00:26:40,024 --> 00:26:47,192
Speaker 1: I mean, you know considering that all the stupid people who were friends at one point either left on their own or We kicked their asses away Yeah

399
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:53,288
Speaker 0: I mean quite literally all of our friends who weren't that bright or had issues Eventually started hating the rest of us and stopped talking to us

400
00:26:53,930 --> 00:27:01,040
Speaker 1: because of said arrogance and self back patting Yeah, and they were unable to pat their own backs because they weren't as smart as we were.

401
00:27:04,285 --> 00:27:19,857
Speaker 0: We had people back at our IT who you know We're still in the anime club after we left actually wishing that me and more importantly wishing that Scott were still there Because when a fanboy was being stupid and annoying Scott would say wow You're stupid and annoying and make him go away and no one else would do that.

402
00:27:19,877 --> 00:27:24,476
Speaker 1: Yep All right, so I replied to this saying is this a hate mail because we asked for it?

403
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:25,360
Speaker 1: or do you really mean it?

404
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:27,692
Speaker 1: Please reply honestly, but I personally hope you really mean.

405
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:29,220
Speaker 0: Oh, you didn't read the end of his email.

406
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:30,724
Speaker 0: Oh, I want to read.

407
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:32,411
Speaker 0: I want to read okay all in all though.

408
00:27:32,431 --> 00:27:33,696
Speaker 0: You guys are fairly entertaining.

409
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,715
Speaker 0: Oh He left a comma.

410
00:27:35,796 --> 00:27:37,204
Speaker 0: Yeah Good job.

411
00:27:37,746 --> 00:27:47,995
Speaker 0: between the inflated sense of self-worth these pseudo intellectual arguments and the Bolloxing with an X up of board game rules You definitely make it easy to waste an hour or so a week at work.

412
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:48,679
Speaker 0: dot dot dot.

413
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,109
Speaker 0: So don't change too much if you stop being two morons arguing.

414
00:27:52,149 --> 00:27:53,593
Speaker 0: you'll likely lose listeners.

415
00:27:53,894 --> 00:27:56,140
Speaker 0: signed uppercase I or lowercase L?

416
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:58,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's I cuz it's store.

417
00:27:58,951 --> 00:27:59,694
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you never know.

418
00:27:59,714 --> 00:28:06,260
Speaker 1: He might be all L Okay, so I asked him if it was hate mail or not and he says I wouldn't qualify it as hate mail.

419
00:28:06,341 --> 00:28:07,819
Speaker 1: It's more like irritation mail.

420
00:28:08,101 --> 00:28:13,260
Speaker 1: I honestly do enjoy the show usually and would probably like you guys in person or at least get along with you.

421
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:14,890
Speaker 1: I did mean everything I said though.

422
00:28:15,071 --> 00:28:15,172
Speaker 0: Now.

423
00:28:15,212 --> 00:28:16,380
Speaker 0: Here's where it gets funny.

424
00:28:16,942 --> 00:28:27,780
Speaker 0: He goes on to say that he anime world order is far worse than us Even if that even if they're things that irritate me, I recognize it could be much worse.

425
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,011
Speaker 1: I listen to that anime world order number 26 to hear the review.

426
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:33,660
Speaker 1: that was supposed to be funny dot dot dot and it was.

427
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,729
Speaker 1: But the rest of the show was painful to listen to.

428
00:28:35,970 --> 00:28:39,065
Speaker 0: now really anime world order is Bar from painful.

429
00:28:39,125 --> 00:28:41,960
Speaker 0: listen to those guys are more informed about anime than we are by leaps.

430
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:45,680
Speaker 1: And in fact, yeah try if you think anime world order is painful to listen to.

431
00:28:47,121 --> 00:28:48,425
Speaker 0: Try listening to all right.

432
00:28:48,465 --> 00:28:50,090
Speaker 0: I'm gonna start bashing some people straight out.

433
00:28:50,251 --> 00:28:52,358
Speaker 0: All right, try listening to Metroid nation.

434
00:28:52,378 --> 00:28:54,999
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I'm sorry, dude, but you need some help.

435
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:03,740
Speaker 0: Let's see what other podcasts are particularly bad the French pod class and maybe it got better but the first ten are pretty piss-poor.

436
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:08,222
Speaker 1: I'm trying to think of a really bad cuz he I just deleted all of them So I can't.

437
00:29:08,262 --> 00:29:10,129
Speaker 1: it's hard to think of the really bad ones.

438
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:13,984
Speaker 0: Oh taco generation is definitely not really really bad But I can't listen to it.

439
00:29:14,265 --> 00:29:17,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'd probably better if they fix their audio a little.

440
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:24,387
Speaker 1: yeah There's some podcasts that are bad because the person's voice is just annoying or the auto quality is You know horrendous and painful.

441
00:29:24,427 --> 00:29:25,029
Speaker 1: and there's some.

442
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:27,439
Speaker 1: we're just what they say you don't want to listen to.

443
00:29:28,143 --> 00:29:38,119
Speaker 0: But I don't know how this guy could find listening to anime world order painful Especially with all of the claims he made against us because those guys pretty much just tell you exactly like it is and they're right.

444
00:29:39,143 --> 00:29:48,732
Speaker 0: Well usually except about opinion issues and then in which case they're all a hundred percent wrong always All right, so I replied to you know, his first email giving a point-by-point.

445
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:55,792
Speaker 1: I said we're not gay, you know, blah blah blah.

446
00:29:55,812 --> 00:30:07,740
Speaker 1: now when he got to the board games, actually I think we didn't talk about this yet is you know, I said hey, you know There are some times we got the rules of board games wrong, you know, I think we played Amun Ray incorrectly for a long time

447
00:30:07,760 --> 00:30:11,661
Speaker 0: Yep, and it's usually because we would just not read the rule book and just go at it Yep,

448
00:30:12,403 --> 00:30:17,240
Speaker 1: and I was like if we actually said something wrong, please tell us what game it is so we can play it correctly.

449
00:30:17,361 --> 00:30:19,331
Speaker 0: No, we're not gonna read the rest of all this.

450
00:30:19,593 --> 00:30:19,794
Speaker 1: No.

451
00:30:19,834 --> 00:30:20,840
Speaker 0: No, there's a lot of it.

452
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:23,252
Speaker 1: I'm just summarizing this board game part.

453
00:30:23,714 --> 00:30:44,300
Speaker 1: and then I said also when we talk about board games or any game or any anime we summarize things and we generalize and We try to give a real general paraphrased summary Explanation of things that anyone can understand without going into all these details that are useless.

454
00:30:44,421 --> 00:30:48,097
Speaker 0: So like we try to do the spirit of the game as opposed to the goods of the game, right?

455
00:30:48,157 --> 00:31:03,139
Speaker 1: So Sometimes in our oversimplification of concepts or games or rules, you know We say things that you know aren't a hundred percent correct because they're generalized Like he really went on about how he said we claimed to talk.

456
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:06,898
Speaker 0: one He said we got a rule wrong in Carcassonne, which we totally don't know we don't.

457
00:31:06,998 --> 00:31:15,591
Speaker 0: and two he really goes on about how we were wrong about the river and he goes on and on about how the river isn't the Way we said and our strategies are crap and we don't understand the game.

458
00:31:15,611 --> 00:31:21,959
Speaker 0: and we didn't talk about the river So long at all and we really just got one sentence about the river or two.

459
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:25,600
Speaker 0: I mean if you wanted and in all series, you can do an episode about the river.

460
00:31:25,721 --> 00:31:28,619
Speaker 0: We could do an entire show about the river.

461
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:38,594
Speaker 0: We and I think way in the future when we start running out of stuff to do or we start having slow times I think we'll actually do episodes of you know, like the tactical analysis of a game.

462
00:31:38,614 --> 00:31:49,300
Speaker 0: You'll do how to win at X Yep, and as to our strategies being new bish or our uber strategies I don't think we've ever explained one of our detailed strategies on the show in any depth at all.

463
00:31:49,429 --> 00:32:02,657
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't think at any point ever we have said this is our uber strategy and talked about a strategy in detail any strategies we've given on the show up until now or General strategies like here's how not to get completely hosed.

464
00:32:02,717 --> 00:32:05,087
Speaker 1: on your first try You'll want to kind of try to do this.

465
00:32:05,449 --> 00:32:07,880
Speaker 1: You want to kind of try to make these kind of decisions?

466
00:32:08,141 --> 00:32:11,480
Speaker 1: Yep, here's something you want to pay attention to to help you make your decision.

467
00:32:12,564 --> 00:32:13,849
Speaker 1: This is the way to win at this game.

468
00:32:13,869 --> 00:32:14,832
Speaker 1: do X Y & Z?

469
00:32:14,853 --> 00:32:21,160
Speaker 0: in this order and in terms of a lot of board Games, we really actually have analyzed them in a great deal like settlers of Catan.

470
00:32:21,722 --> 00:32:29,193
Speaker 0: I don't think anyone who knows a lot about board games would disagree that the game is really Fundamentally kind of broken when four people who know what they're doing play it.

471
00:32:29,474 --> 00:32:29,654
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

472
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:33,469
Speaker 0: as are many many games I mean, there are basically only three strategies.

473
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:35,176
Speaker 0: There's the brick and wood.

474
00:32:35,498 --> 00:32:42,820
Speaker 0: There's the Cities and then there's the tripods and various combinations thereof and placement really matters more than anything else.

475
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,087
Speaker 0: I mean with skilled players.

476
00:32:44,469 --> 00:32:44,972
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

477
00:32:44,992 --> 00:32:46,360
Speaker 0: Well other than obviously dice rolls.

478
00:32:47,541 --> 00:32:51,299
Speaker 0: Now I could talk about that for two hours, but I'm not gonna because no one wants to hear that just yet.

479
00:32:51,942 --> 00:32:52,102
Speaker 0: Yep.

480
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:53,829
Speaker 1: Hey, what else do we want to do?

481
00:32:53,909 --> 00:32:57,684
Speaker 0: is I want to get this because I'm gonna read this section because he won't let Go this gay thing.

482
00:32:57,704 --> 00:33:00,555
Speaker 0: Okay, as Scott says we're not gay rim.

483
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:04,234
Speaker 0: as a girlfriend of many years I'm always in search of quote female companionship.

484
00:33:04,355 --> 00:33:05,260
Speaker 1: I didn't put quotes around that.

485
00:33:05,401 --> 00:33:08,940
Speaker 0: No, I I said quote to ensure that they know that you said the words female companionship.

486
00:33:09,101 --> 00:33:09,422
Speaker 1: Okay.

487
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:13,660
Speaker 0: Now why if you put quotes around that that really changes the meaning of your sentence now, doesn't it?

488
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:16,328
Speaker 1: I know it's why I was worried you were gonna put quotes around it.

489
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:17,110
Speaker 0: Okay.

490
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,575
Speaker 0: Now he says quote.

491
00:33:18,996 --> 00:33:22,007
Speaker 0: really my mistake My gaydar must be broken.

492
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:22,990
Speaker 0: It sure is.

493
00:33:23,151 --> 00:33:25,540
Speaker 0: you realize his girlfriend could just be a beard, right?

494
00:33:25,941 --> 00:33:31,311
Speaker 0: Maybe he's just waiting for the right moment to pounce on you and then he says it again This is because I was emailing the guy.

495
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:32,880
Speaker 1: so if he says you he's talking to me.

496
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,959
Speaker 0: Yes, not that there's anything wrong with that.

497
00:33:36,001 --> 00:33:42,080
Speaker 1: Okay, so either he's having fantasies about me and rim together, which is whatever floats your boat.

498
00:33:42,421 --> 00:33:43,143
Speaker 0: I'm fine with that.

499
00:33:43,323 --> 00:33:45,629
Speaker 1: But no Emily isn't a beard.

500
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:49,780
Speaker 1: She was on the show and I've seen her many times in many years.

501
00:33:50,302 --> 00:33:51,185
Speaker 0: She is quite awesome.

502
00:33:51,246 --> 00:33:51,547
Speaker 1: She is.

503
00:33:51,688 --> 00:33:54,600
Speaker 1: She's a real person and she has boobs in a vagina.

504
00:33:55,443 --> 00:33:57,200
Speaker 0: So that is not quite all I would describe.

505
00:33:58,344 --> 00:34:00,511
Speaker 1: Well, no, I'm just saying that she's not a beard.

506
00:34:00,531 --> 00:34:03,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, and she doesn't have a beard either.

507
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:06,845
Speaker 1: Yes, she is real.

508
00:34:07,647 --> 00:34:08,811
Speaker 1: yeah and not the country.

509
00:34:09,011 --> 00:34:10,757
Speaker 0: and now the thing is we.

510
00:34:10,917 --> 00:34:11,699
Speaker 1: oh you miss my joke.

511
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:14,545
Speaker 0: God the front row crew.

512
00:34:14,606 --> 00:34:18,139
Speaker 0: We actually joke about our sexuality a lot all of us.

513
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,509
Speaker 0: I mean we have this running gag of the yaoi couch.

514
00:34:21,130 --> 00:34:22,396
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't know what yaoi is.

515
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:23,320
Speaker 0: Don't worry about it.

516
00:34:24,601 --> 00:34:27,431
Speaker 1: But at the same time none of us are really perverted.

517
00:34:27,994 --> 00:34:34,340
Speaker 0: not only we're not converted healthily Sexual, I mean, I think Pete was the one who said this and I don't know if he was quoting someone.

518
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:39,911
Speaker 0: I forget and I'm not gonna get it right at all But he said something to the effect of that's like two Vikings having sex.

519
00:34:40,132 --> 00:34:41,116
Speaker 0: It's so manly.

520
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:42,060
Speaker 0: It's not gay.

521
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:49,536
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like, you know old and Greek guys, you know back in the days of Greece, you know You were gay, but it wasn't gay to be gay.

522
00:34:50,382 --> 00:34:51,647
Speaker 0: That's an interesting way to put it.

523
00:34:51,687 --> 00:34:54,639
Speaker 0: But I know yeah, except we're actually not gay, right?

524
00:34:55,482 --> 00:34:59,380
Speaker 0: I wouldn't keep talking about this, but he really seems to have a bug up his butt that we're somehow gay.

525
00:34:59,541 --> 00:35:01,579
Speaker 1: I think he wants us to be gay because he's gay.

526
00:35:02,041 --> 00:35:03,486
Speaker 0: See the thing is pouncing.

527
00:35:03,546 --> 00:35:06,296
Speaker 0: Scott would be like having sex with a beanbag full of antlers.

528
00:35:06,336 --> 00:35:10,408
Speaker 1: He's one gangly, dude You know, there's some meat on me in places.

529
00:35:10,769 --> 00:35:12,856
Speaker 0: Yeah in 1.5 places.

530
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:13,699
Speaker 0: There's meat on you.

531
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:19,760
Speaker 0: Hey, I just really wanted to make my beanbag antlers joke because I make it a lot and it never gets old with me.

532
00:35:20,182 --> 00:35:21,650
Speaker 0: Okay, I don't even know where I got it from.

533
00:35:21,932 --> 00:35:24,505
Speaker 0: you beanbag full of antlers you All right.

534
00:35:24,525 --> 00:35:25,879
Speaker 0: What else was particularly good in this?

535
00:35:26,401 --> 00:35:35,333
Speaker 0: He really doesn't like the fact that we say we say elite words like fair and I like how Scott was like, by the way You know when we say fear, we're actually saying ph33r.

536
00:35:35,855 --> 00:35:36,399
Speaker 0: Did you notice?

537
00:35:36,419 --> 00:35:38,285
Speaker 0: I Found that hilarious.

538
00:35:38,728 --> 00:35:40,820
Speaker 1: He's like they are part of printed slang.

539
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:41,402
Speaker 1: No more.

540
00:35:41,703 --> 00:35:44,732
Speaker 1: pun is pronounced own just as fear is pronounced fear.

541
00:35:44,792 --> 00:35:47,180
Speaker 1: Well, no pun is pronounced pun and Owen is pretty.

542
00:35:47,622 --> 00:35:51,937
Speaker 0: There is an alternate pronunciation of pun called pone which seems to come from new world elite.

543
00:35:52,258 --> 00:35:52,720
Speaker 1: It's pun.

544
00:35:53,144 --> 00:35:54,900
Speaker 0: Yes, that is where it originally was spoken.

545
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:58,591
Speaker 0: Oh and as far as opposed to what he says what next?

546
00:35:58,651 --> 00:36:01,100
Speaker 0: finding a pronunciation for emoticons, I've done that.

547
00:36:01,682 --> 00:36:02,785
Speaker 0: I've done that many a time.

548
00:36:02,805 --> 00:36:09,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, I will make emoticon finger motions when I talk to people colon smiley colon parentheses.

549
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:13,994
Speaker 0: In fact, I had a thing that was funny for about a day and then got really hyphen

550
00:36:14,054 --> 00:36:14,716
Speaker 1: close paren

551
00:36:14,756 --> 00:36:23,559
Speaker 0: where I'd always make a slash With my finger and then say whatever someone would say after a slash on FARC Which was funny and then it got really dumb and then even I got sick of it.

552
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:33,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I asked him who was the slow one and he says I'm like I said me and he says yep Though the slowness may be relative to your buddy's speech patterns.

553
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,115
Speaker 1: as far as arguments.

554
00:36:35,196 --> 00:36:36,340
Speaker 1: I know one when I hear one.

555
00:36:36,733 --> 00:36:46,111
Speaker 0: Yeah well For anyone who's curious about seeing an argument that we're involved in that's a good one because the World of Warcraft one isn't good yet Because no one's really I keep trying to make it good.

556
00:36:46,231 --> 00:36:55,188
Speaker 1: But because I really hate having this argument I have the World of Warcraft argument so Often and everything that can be said has been said.

557
00:36:55,248 --> 00:37:00,183
Speaker 1: so I'm really trying to mix it up and say new things and use new examples and analogies.

558
00:37:00,283 --> 00:37:07,352
Speaker 0: I'm staying out of it because I take a much more moderate position and Also, no one really addressed any of my questions bully.

559
00:37:07,372 --> 00:37:16,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like no one really Understands the way that I'm talking about the game is like because it's like they can't look at it from the same perspective as me.

560
00:37:16,622 --> 00:37:18,371
Speaker 1: So I can't really communicate the ideas.

561
00:37:18,411 --> 00:37:20,180
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get across the best example.

562
00:37:20,361 --> 00:37:27,777
Speaker 0: I mean we talk in the forums about how we had a big argument where we got people to agree that we were right on A few points which are critical to the argument going on in the forums.

563
00:37:27,818 --> 00:37:38,342
Speaker 0: now We're arguing with Pete and Scott Johnson both of which were in the forums now talking about that Kremlin and the whale shark and both I said both of which I should have said both of whom Mm-hmm.

564
00:37:38,543 --> 00:37:41,860
Speaker 0: But anyway, both of whom also play World of Warcraft.

565
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:53,260
Speaker 0: But yet they argued with us and conceded these points and a good three-quarters of the argument ended up with us explaining in great detail Game theory and our terminology so that we could actually have the argument.

566
00:37:53,381 --> 00:38:00,737
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like let's say there's someone on the street who knows nothing about computers But they insist that the internet is made up of tubes.

567
00:38:00,858 --> 00:38:01,965
Speaker 1: exactly It's now.

568
00:38:01,985 --> 00:38:10,310
Speaker 1: if I'm going to argue against them I have to first teach them that you know I have to give them information and make them learn it and understand it.

569
00:38:10,351 --> 00:38:15,852
Speaker 1: and that's very difficult because I'm trying to argue game theory Against people who don't understand game theory.

570
00:38:15,892 --> 00:38:20,380
Speaker 1: it also if I tell them is it you know It's a game of imperfect information blah blah blah blah blah.

571
00:38:20,542 --> 00:38:22,120
Speaker 1: They have no idea what the hell I'm talking about.

572
00:38:22,481 --> 00:38:26,499
Speaker 1: So I have to give all these examples of like shells and balls and stuff.

573
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:32,892
Speaker 0: And yeah, like when we say when I say something like a game requires no skill I don't mean the game requires no skill.

574
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:40,498
Speaker 0: in a common use of the word skill I mean the game requires no direct tactic direct meaningful non arbitrary tactical decisions.

575
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:41,562
Speaker 1: exactly You know.

576
00:38:41,783 --> 00:38:46,080
Speaker 1: because when we argue in person we use words that are so specific.

577
00:38:46,502 --> 00:38:51,400
Speaker 1: And when I write you know any post on any forum online I use words.

578
00:38:51,881 --> 00:38:57,055
Speaker 1: So even more specifically like I say exact words to mean an exact thing.

579
00:38:57,076 --> 00:39:02,583
Speaker 1: and then when people read it they just kind of take the general gist and They lose.

580
00:39:02,603 --> 00:39:07,580
Speaker 1: you read every single word and figure out exactly what I am saying.

581
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:13,298
Speaker 0: I am saying no more and no less than that now just so because his primary thing is that we're arrogant.

582
00:39:13,699 --> 00:39:14,322
Speaker 0: and well We are.

583
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:19,800
Speaker 0: but I will note that when we say you know these words We're not saying like oh people just don't understand words.

584
00:39:19,840 --> 00:39:30,700
Speaker 0: It's more that when you're argue about a technical thing or anything that has a wealth of information and research about it There is something called jargon the definition of jargon.

585
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:43,240
Speaker 0: but jargon is is jargon are words that are very specific to a specific field and have Specific meanings within that field that are commonly unknown to people who are not deep in deeply mirrored in that field.

586
00:39:43,922 --> 00:39:52,865
Speaker 1: for example the word theory as you know the con the colloquial use is very different from the scientific scientific use.

587
00:39:53,427 --> 00:40:05,132
Speaker 0: yeah, so but anyway if you want to see a good example of an argument that actually We used our not our full abilities because it was kind of like beating a dandelion to death But these sports argument in the forums.

588
00:40:05,574 --> 00:40:06,800
Speaker 1: Oh that is a fantastic one.

589
00:40:06,941 --> 00:40:10,900
Speaker 0: That is one where there was really no opposition and all we did we just pulled out.

590
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,176
Speaker 1: It was just a beat down basically beating a dandelion to death.

591
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:17,818
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, that that one was fun cuz it.

592
00:40:19,243 --> 00:40:23,859
Speaker 1: It was like it was like a soft toss baseball, and I just didn't ready to go with my metal bet.

593
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, but he says he's probably not gonna join the forums.

594
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:33,340
Speaker 1: This is store guy because he has enough stuff to do But you don't have to join the forums to go read them.

595
00:40:33,460 --> 00:40:40,180
Speaker 1: So if you have spare time go to the forum and read that sports argument And you'll see how we can really get on someone.

596
00:40:40,821 --> 00:40:43,032
Speaker 0: Yeah, also if you don't have time to read the forum.

597
00:40:43,072 --> 00:40:44,660
Speaker 0: you seem to have plenty of time to send us hate mail.

598
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:49,246
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you're applied pretty quickly, so You got time for that shit.

599
00:40:49,407 --> 00:40:52,468
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Don't know we could make fun of this some more.

600
00:40:52,488 --> 00:40:53,595
Speaker 0: you spelled some words wrong.

601
00:40:54,138 --> 00:40:57,890
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, if you spell the word wrong - it happens.

602
00:40:57,910 --> 00:40:58,512
Speaker 1: No one's perfect.

603
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:01,240
Speaker 0: No it shouldn't happen mr.. Perry to be all up in your ass.

604
00:41:01,421 --> 00:41:02,827
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not in the forum, so what's he gonna.

605
00:41:02,847 --> 00:41:03,972
Speaker 1: Do to me true.

606
00:41:04,052 --> 00:41:05,539
Speaker 0: We've never actually met him in person.

607
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:10,094
Speaker 0: so Well you know if watch for all you know he's like seven feet tall.

608
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:11,037
Speaker 0: he's like 400 pounds.

609
00:41:15,403 --> 00:41:18,034
Speaker 0: Would it be funny if mr.. Perry actually was like someone?

610
00:41:18,416 --> 00:41:18,938
Speaker 1: yeah, I know.

611
00:41:19,118 --> 00:41:20,664
Speaker 1: anyway Is store?

612
00:41:20,744 --> 00:41:26,331
Speaker 1: you know I think is store would have a problem in the forum because you'd have to really carefully write all as opposed To avoid mr.. Perry.

613
00:41:26,553 --> 00:41:28,324
Speaker 0: yeah Who?

614
00:41:28,365 --> 00:41:32,040
Speaker 1: there's someone in the forums now who's really bad and mr.. Beard keeps getting them.

615
00:41:32,461 --> 00:41:36,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what I just we should say we're done with the hate mail our out of the meta bits.

616
00:41:37,281 --> 00:41:41,919
Speaker 0: If you go back and read a post you made and there's a bunch of red marks all over it that means mr.

617
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,067
Speaker 0: Perry had got you.

618
00:41:43,107 --> 00:41:44,859
Speaker 0: look at what those red marks are and try to learn.

619
00:41:45,581 --> 00:41:56,259
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you if you come to our forum before you post something push the preview button read it carefully reread it Make sure you use the spell check thing that we installed there.

620
00:41:56,922 --> 00:42:01,696
Speaker 0: Yeah there versus there versus there it's versus it's lose versus loose.

621
00:42:01,796 --> 00:42:03,861
Speaker 0: good God people I Mean.

622
00:42:04,203 --> 00:42:10,428
Speaker 0: penny arcade has a huge forum and a huge community around it And it's basically a den of iniquity insane.

623
00:42:10,849 --> 00:42:13,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you go look and penny arcades form.

624
00:42:13,316 --> 00:42:14,699
Speaker 1: It's basically like fear.

625
00:42:14,799 --> 00:42:20,186
Speaker 0: whoo No crap There's enough of that on the internet.

626
00:42:20,247 --> 00:42:36,160
Speaker 0: so we decided early on that if we were going to have a community around geek nights We were going to make sure that it is like this ivory tower Oasis in a sea of horridness like a bastion of logic and reason and at least grammar if nothing else grammar.

627
00:42:36,281 --> 00:42:47,260
Speaker 1: Yes, if you're forced to look at your grammar and make sure that it's correct Then you'll also be forced you know to reread what you wrote and possibly rewrite it in a more intelligent fashion.

628
00:42:47,461 --> 00:42:47,783
Speaker 1: Also

629
00:42:47,803 --> 00:42:59,180
Speaker 0: it a lot of people say oh grammar doesn't matter I still understood what you meant and that comes back to the problem Scott has and I have a lot with arguing with people is That yeah, you can get the gist of what someone means if their grammar is bad.

630
00:42:59,582 --> 00:43:04,183
Speaker 0: But if the grammar is bad you lose so much of the very specific Meaning that's there.

631
00:43:04,564 --> 00:43:15,797
Speaker 0: and someone like me who if we're arguing and I'm trying to read the specific meaning you have so I can specifically Counter it your bad grammar means that the point you think you're making is not the point you're actually making.

632
00:43:16,098 --> 00:43:24,060
Speaker 0: in which case I'll say I'll say something about the grammar and then usually people respond with oh You're just a grammar Nazi pet in ivory tower blah blah blah blah blah

633
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:29,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also people who have better grammar and better writing skills tend to have better reading comprehension skills.

634
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:36,119
Speaker 1: So when they read other people's posts, they can better understand the fineries of their word smithery.

635
00:43:36,761 --> 00:43:37,484
Speaker 0: I like that a lot.

636
00:43:37,604 --> 00:43:37,905
Speaker 1: Yes,

637
00:43:38,287 --> 00:43:46,042
Speaker 0: plus honestly, it's bothering me more and more because every job I've had even other than the doctors who seem to actually actually know grammar Whoa,

638
00:43:46,122 --> 00:43:47,287
Speaker 1: go go go doctors

639
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:57,607
Speaker 0: most of the people I work with not just like in my company But I'm saying very broadly like in all my years as a technology professional and even when I was at RIT in classes People it's not like they don't.

640
00:43:57,949 --> 00:44:11,585
Speaker 0: they don't even know grammar as far as I can tell I mean I could get to the point where I write a short memo to someone and Because it has proper grammar and spelling and formatting my boss or my boss's boss will say something like wow Good job on that memo.

641
00:44:11,605 --> 00:44:19,745
Speaker 1: and whenever I write any email or any forum post anywhere for any reason I always like double check it in three times.

642
00:44:19,785 --> 00:44:22,510
Speaker 1: Check it to make sure everything is as good as I can in a.

643
00:44:23,180 --> 00:44:25,411
Speaker 0: Quotes from Scott on our show.

644
00:44:25,431 --> 00:44:28,542
Speaker 0: We don't do super in-depth hardcore Analysis.

645
00:44:28,903 --> 00:44:30,708
Speaker 1: Okay, you know, I'm not perfect though.

646
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:32,734
Speaker 1: I can only check it so many times.

647
00:44:33,275 --> 00:44:36,185
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah speaking of ivory towers This is a non sequitur.

688
00:46:17,801 --> 00:46:20,853
Speaker 1: I just want to know what in ivory tower is linking to us.

689
00:46:20,873 --> 00:46:22,600
Speaker 1: I think it must be on their forum or something.

690
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,503
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz lately I've been having a lot of free time at work like in downtime when I'm just you know Like between projects.

691
00:46:28,523 --> 00:46:29,245
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for something.

692
00:46:29,847 --> 00:46:33,500
Speaker 0: I'll just look at all the refers we're getting and try to see who cares about geek nights.

693
00:46:33,881 --> 00:46:36,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, apparently ivory tower comm cares about one thing.

694
00:46:36,547 --> 00:46:41,780
Speaker 0: I gotta say we people search for some weird freaking shit and find our forums.

695
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:43,624
Speaker 0: Yeah, good God.

696
00:46:43,805 --> 00:46:44,948
Speaker 0: Well, they should also.

697
00:46:44,988 --> 00:46:51,568
Speaker 0: what's really cool is that we show up really high for a lot of Google searches like a Ultraviolet movies.

698
00:46:51,649 --> 00:46:58,039
Speaker 0: we show up real high cool Yeah, and a lot of people come to the forums after searching for that way.

699
00:46:58,059 --> 00:47:02,579
Speaker 0: cool Which gives me faith in mankind that there are people out there who enjoy ultraviolet movies as much as we do.

700
00:47:03,742 --> 00:47:06,176
Speaker 1: All right, you want to just cover some meta bits and then be done with this.

701
00:47:06,498 --> 00:47:08,611
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, it's just the end of the week.

702
00:47:08,873 --> 00:47:12,694
Speaker 0: next week is pretty much It's gonna be silly and the week after that is going to be sillier.

703
00:47:12,714 --> 00:47:17,273
Speaker 1: Yeah, I Fixed the website a little bit front row crew comm.

704
00:47:17,896 --> 00:47:26,827
Speaker 1: on the right side The the link you can click on to subscribe to geek nights and iTunes is fixed The down at the bottom right.

705
00:47:27,148 --> 00:47:30,600
Speaker 1: not, you know up near the top but down at the bottom bottom, right?

706
00:47:31,540 --> 00:47:37,760
Speaker 1: There is a link to frapper which is a map of pushpins and there should be a pushpin for all of our listeners.

707
00:47:37,881 --> 00:47:38,545
Speaker 1: But there is not.

708
00:47:38,887 --> 00:47:44,416
Speaker 1: so if you are listening and you do not add a pushpin You should go to that rapper link and add a pushpin

709
00:47:44,456 --> 00:47:55,439
Speaker 0: and while you're at it I like I'm not gonna ask you to vote for us now those stupid vote for podcast Websites because I think that's really kind of dumb and That sort of thing has been going around since the early days of the internet and they were never useful ever

710
00:47:55,801 --> 00:47:56,062
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

711
00:47:56,444 --> 00:48:06,336
Speaker 0: but if you listen to us on iTunes and it's not a bother You should totally actually rate geek nights because that's one of the few things iTunes uses to figure out what people are listening to.

712
00:48:06,698 --> 00:48:13,769
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, I hate asking people to do any of those voting Rating reviewing things on any directory.

713
00:48:13,829 --> 00:48:17,140
Speaker 0: So I didn't realize you could rate things in iTunes until like three days ago.

714
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:30,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the podcast alley and all that stupid shit You know because if it's people telling their listeners to do it Then it kind of games the system in that it should be people doing it of their own volition because the shows are so good.

715
00:48:30,481 --> 00:48:34,860
Speaker 0: But at the same time people who just listen to shows and like a show don't even bother with that crap.

716
00:48:35,102 --> 00:48:36,838
Speaker 1: I know it's it's it's a catch-22.

717
00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:40,534
Speaker 1: It's a really bad system and that's why I don't tell anyone to do it.

718
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:41,960
Speaker 1: In fact, I tell you not to do it.

719
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,304
Speaker 1: Don't do it for any podcast.

720
00:48:43,404 --> 00:48:45,790
Speaker 1: don't vote on the stupid podcast alley.

721
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:59,620
Speaker 1: We need a better system for people to find podcasts they like and is manual voting mechanism where Listeners have to do work so that the podcast they like can become more popular is stupid?

722
00:48:59,720 --> 00:49:05,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd like to see some sort of like delicious of opmls or some sort of tagging people who tag things more often.

723
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, that would be cool.

724
00:49:07,105 --> 00:49:07,667
Speaker 1: Check it out ready.

725
00:49:07,808 --> 00:49:16,413
Speaker 1: Everyone has an opml in their podcatcher and You have a little plug-in in your podcatcher that automatically submits your opml to.

726
00:49:16,935 --> 00:49:27,220
Speaker 1: you know, some website every week that website Aggregates all the opmls figures out which podcasts have new, you know, the most new subscriptions the most total subscriptions.

727
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:31,272
Speaker 1: Which ones are actually getting listened to versus not getting listened to?

728
00:49:31,793 --> 00:49:32,957
Speaker 1: that would be a good system.

729
00:49:33,017 --> 00:49:34,100
Speaker 1: We should set that shit up.

730
00:49:34,261 --> 00:49:35,505
Speaker 1: I just came up with a great idea.

731
00:49:35,525 --> 00:49:36,087
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

732
00:49:36,308 --> 00:49:37,433
Speaker 1: Yeah, no one steal it.

733
00:49:37,573 --> 00:49:38,216
Speaker 1: No one steal that.

734
00:49:38,416 --> 00:49:39,320
Speaker 0: god damn it all of you.

735
00:49:40,024 --> 00:49:49,051
Speaker 0: I have the evidence right here prior actually actually Well, because our good friend Alex who is equally intelligent to both of us He's a cool dude, and he's moving out to where we are.

736
00:49:49,071 --> 00:49:50,036
Speaker 0: That's it.

737
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:50,458
Speaker 1: Alex.

738
00:49:50,478 --> 00:49:52,471
Speaker 1: You listening That's what we're gonna do when you come here.

739
00:49:52,511 --> 00:49:53,780
Speaker 1: We're making that project happen.

740
00:49:53,941 --> 00:49:57,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, because we have a lot of items and we'll start it with an iTunes plug-in.

741
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:01,619
Speaker 0: We have a lot of projects that are on the back burner only because this one is the most urgent right now.

742
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,900
Speaker 0: The guys takes up too much of our lives right now to do all these other things like we can barely manage that gaming club.

743
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:09,230
Speaker 1: Maybe we can piggyback off of audio Scrabble.

744
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:09,933
Speaker 1: er last FM.

745
00:50:10,355 --> 00:50:11,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we could.

746
00:50:11,359 --> 00:50:11,640
Speaker 1: I don't know.

747
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,719
Speaker 1: We're gonna have to research this a little bit, but we got dibs bitches.

748
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:17,474
Speaker 0: Yes, if any let it be said it's word of God.

749
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:18,680
Speaker 1: if anyone steals this idea.

750
00:50:21,204 --> 00:50:22,334
Speaker 1: I'm so coding this right away.

751
00:50:22,395 --> 00:50:23,900
Speaker 1: Okay So yeah.

752
00:50:24,081 --> 00:50:29,480
Speaker 1: Also in the bottom right of front road crew comm is a link that says send me an audio with this pink star.

753
00:50:29,601 --> 00:50:31,648
Speaker 0: We've gotten some already One.

754
00:50:31,688 --> 00:50:38,980
Speaker 0: bear in mind if you send us audio Don't feel bad if you don't use it or we don't use it right away Because we can't use all the audio we get you.

755
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:42,380
Speaker 0: We've got a lot of audio that we haven't even had a chance to use yet.

756
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:54,048
Speaker 1: yeah, so the way send me an audio works is you click on it and this little flash program shows up and you click record and you talk into a microphone plugged into your computer and it can record what you say.

757
00:50:54,068 --> 00:51:00,840
Speaker 1: and it's sort of like leaving us a voicemail and Even if you don't like what you say you can like trash it and try to say something again.

758
00:51:01,021 --> 00:51:05,360
Speaker 1: So it's much better than calling us on the phone where you might say something stupid.

759
00:51:06,102 --> 00:51:17,917
Speaker 1: At least with this you can practice and take a few different takes until you say what you want to say correctly And then you click send and it shows up in our email as an mp3 Which is perfect because you can put that right in the show.

760
00:51:19,161 --> 00:51:23,018
Speaker 1: so if you want to send us audio feedback, that is currently the best way.

761
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:24,883
Speaker 1: and What else?

762
00:51:25,225 --> 00:51:28,664
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we have a forum that we've talked about a hundred times The forum.

763
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:30,951
Speaker 0: it gets about a thousand.

764
00:51:30,971 --> 00:51:32,416
Speaker 0: Well, it gets a thousand unique hits a day.

765
00:51:32,476 --> 00:51:33,660
Speaker 1: now it gets a lot.

766
00:51:33,961 --> 00:51:36,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, it gets like four thousand hits a day minimum.

767
00:51:36,910 --> 00:51:38,515
Speaker 1: It's pretty crazy in that forum there.

768
00:51:38,716 --> 00:51:40,421
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's very happy I make.

769
00:51:40,722 --> 00:51:46,097
Speaker 0: I'm very happy and it makes me very pleased that the forum we created has got a self-sustaining community.

770
00:51:46,138 --> 00:51:51,500
Speaker 0: now to where if Scott and I disappeared from the forum for a while people keep talking to each other.

771
00:51:51,927 --> 00:51:52,640
Speaker 0: It's a wonderful thing.

772
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:58,700
Speaker 0: And actually one of the more recent people who joined actually said that the reason he joined was because it was a best.

773
00:51:58,941 --> 00:52:03,280
Speaker 0: He said that basically it was one of the few places on the internet where intelligent discussion was happening.

774
00:52:03,983 --> 00:52:09,528
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean even in places where there is some Intelligent discussion happening.

775
00:52:09,810 --> 00:52:17,440
Speaker 1: There is lots of idiot discussion also happening And there are also some other places on the internet where there is intelligent discussion, but it isn't open to all.

776
00:52:17,722 --> 00:52:19,797
Speaker 1: You know, it's sort of like this locked in.

777
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:33,408
Speaker 0: Yeah We've never denied anyone access to the forums yet And we've only banned one person ever by popular vote of everyone in the forum after a lengthy court-martial Mm-hmm, and he was really annoying too.

778
00:52:33,469 --> 00:52:36,138
Speaker 0: If you're still listening, we're glad you're listening, but you were really annoying.

779
00:52:36,158 --> 00:52:43,240
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, there's some people who are in the forum now who are a little annoying and so I won't mention them because they'll be upset.

780
00:52:43,501 --> 00:52:43,863
Speaker 0: You know what?

781
00:52:43,944 --> 00:52:45,291
Speaker 0: Everyone's gonna think is it me?

782
00:52:45,432 --> 00:52:45,875
Speaker 0: and you know what?

783
00:52:45,895 --> 00:52:53,533
Speaker 1: if you're thinking that yeah Yeah, but they're they're above the line There's a line and if you're below that line, then you're in trouble.

784
00:52:53,573 --> 00:53:07,240
Speaker 1: the lines real low Seriously, but you know It's still high enough to filter out most of the crap because there's so much peep There's so much below that low low low line that filtering that out makes the forum just fantastic.

785
00:53:07,300 --> 00:53:11,256
Speaker 0: I mean how many GNAA posts go to every single article on slash dot?

786
00:53:11,557 --> 00:53:14,743
Speaker 1: I know seriously Yeah, and mr.

788
00:53:20,463 --> 00:53:25,482

Speaker 1: This guy is terrible.

792
00:53:29,458 --> 00:53:33,514
Speaker 0: Yes, and Maybe if we grow we might have to get other moderators to assist him.

793
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:34,478
Speaker 0: I don't know what we'll call him.

794

Speaker 1: Comma.

800
00:53:38,599 --> 00:53:39,944
Speaker 1: Mr Comma's got to come first.

801
00:53:40,125 --> 00:53:44,440
Speaker 0: Yes, cuz commas are probably the second most poorly used things in the forum right now.

802
00:53:44,863 --> 00:53:46,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, I use them correctly.

803
00:53:46,708 --> 00:53:50,072
Speaker 0: Yes And I got to say I think I'm gonna write a little thing.

804
00:53:50,112 --> 00:53:56,571
Speaker 0: or maybe we'll do a special show on grammar one day when I'll talk about the differences between Spaces commas semicolons and colons.

805
00:53:56,591 --> 00:53:59,944
Speaker 0: they all have uses all of them Even the semicolon.

806
00:54:00,265 --> 00:54:05,622
Speaker 0: if you don't know what a semicolon is and how to use it one don't use it - I don't know What to say.

807
00:54:05,702 --> 00:54:06,886
Speaker 0: cuz you should be using them.

808
00:54:07,267 --> 00:54:07,829
Speaker 1: Yeah, and mr.

809
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:13,212
Speaker 1: Period informed us today of the the intero bang Which is not a punctuation I knew about before.

810
00:54:13,313 --> 00:54:14,620
Speaker 0: Well, I used it all the time.

811
00:54:14,660 --> 00:54:15,886
Speaker 0: I didn't know there was a word for it.

812
00:54:16,046 --> 00:54:16,810
Speaker 1: I don't know.

813
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:17,111
Speaker 1: mr.

814
00:54:17,151 --> 00:54:21,030
Speaker 1: Period's like, yeah, that's perfectly valid There's an intero bang and that's what that is.

815
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:21,875
Speaker 1: And I'm like, oh shit.

816
00:54:22,056 --> 00:54:22,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, look at that.

817
00:54:25,221 --> 00:54:34,055
Speaker 0: So, yeah, all right, we've gone on long we're kind of episode is crazy, you know what it's fine it's Thursday I don't know.

818
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:40,660
Speaker 1: Don't listen to geek nights until um, I mean there's gonna be some crap episodes.

819
00:54:40,780 --> 00:54:46,860
Speaker 0: No, they're not gonna be crap because I found that the more we'll dislike an episode the more our listeners seem to love it.

820
00:54:47,131 --> 00:54:51,599
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean we had an episode way way back where we just got pissed at each other and argued for bringers.

821
00:54:51,619 --> 00:54:53,506
Speaker 0: the whole thing Not really arguing but rhetoric.

822
00:54:53,606 --> 00:54:53,726
Speaker 1: ing.

823
00:54:53,747 --> 00:54:54,670
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

824
00:54:54,871 --> 00:54:58,042
Speaker 1: Don't expect good geek nights until August 14 That's all.

825
00:54:58,062 --> 00:55:03,744
Speaker 0: I at least don't expect geek nights that don't involve us making inside jokes and laughing at ourselves Constantly.

826
00:55:04,106 --> 00:55:05,453
Speaker 1: so until August 14th.

827
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:06,600
Speaker 1: He nice is gonna be silly.

828
00:55:07,162 --> 00:55:11,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe we'll get a guest spot or something for when we're gone or maybe we'll run some classic bits.

829
00:55:11,300 --> 00:55:18,177
Speaker 1: We're not sure that would be awesome If we just got people to make geek nights episodes instead of us and then we put them up each day, huh?

830
00:55:19,741 --> 00:55:20,103
Speaker 0: You know what?

831
00:55:20,123 --> 00:55:23,360
Speaker 1: I don't know if we can do that on such short notice, but we do have like two weeks, right?

832
00:55:24,061 --> 00:55:26,420
Speaker 0: Yeah, but everyone we know is going to Otacon.

833
00:55:26,626 --> 00:55:33,200
Speaker 1: Well, no, no Like other podcasters who aren't going every podcaster I know is going to Otacon all the anime geek podcasters.

834
00:55:33,321 --> 00:55:35,479
Speaker 1: But there's some people who aren't going and you know what?

835
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,820
Speaker 0: You know what way if I can get the guy who does the 12 Byzantine Empire's Emperor's podcast to do us a special.

836
00:55:42,146 --> 00:55:42,880
Speaker 0: That guy's awesome.

837
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:53,419
Speaker 1: I was thinking more a lot along the lines of a listener who isn't going to Otacon who has the ability to podcast And you know could just make a show in the geek nights format and we'll see how they do.

838
00:55:53,963 --> 00:55:55,052
Speaker 0: Yeah, we might I don't know.

839
00:55:55,092 --> 00:55:56,000
Speaker 0: we'll figure out what we're doing.

840
00:55:56,201 --> 00:56:10,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you want to know more about what may or may not be going on if you think yeah If you think you are capable of creating a geek nights podcast by the week of August The week after next week exactly.

841
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:13,610
Speaker 1: So either August 7th 8th 9th or 10th.

842
00:56:14,091 --> 00:56:17,965
Speaker 1: if you think you can make geek nights on one of those days Send us an email.

843
00:56:18,487 --> 00:56:20,073
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we'll work something out possibly.

844
00:56:20,093 --> 00:56:24,495
Speaker 1: Yeah, where you send us an mp3 We upload it and with all that we might just give you the double deuce.

845
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:25,320
Speaker 0: We're not sure what we'll do.

846
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you suck, we'll give you the double.

847
00:56:27,055 --> 00:56:29,164
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

848
00:56:29,486 --> 00:56:30,793
Speaker 0: We're actually done for tonight.

849
00:56:30,874 --> 00:56:31,880
Speaker 0: It was a long episode.

850
00:56:32,842 --> 00:56:34,720
Speaker 0: We're very happy to have gotten our first hate mail.

851
00:56:35,941 --> 00:56:39,459
Speaker 0: The homosexual bit is the only thing that makes me question how much of a hate mail it is.
