00:00:41,024 --> 00:00:41,466
Speaker 0: Yeah.

10
00:00:41,646 --> 00:00:43,414
Speaker 1: Also, I like thunderstorms I miss.

11
00:00:43,515 --> 00:00:45,570
Speaker 0: I like thunderstorms at night when I'm inside.

12
00:00:46,095 --> 00:00:49,217
Speaker 0: I if I'm outside then I don't like them But if I'm inside they're the best.

13
00:00:49,237 --> 00:00:52,090
Speaker 1: but I guess my walk actually my favorite the one there's like.

14
00:00:52,554 --> 00:00:54,230
Speaker 1: I want to live in cities for the rest of my life.

15
00:00:54,311 --> 00:01:00,381
Speaker 1: in fact, I want to live in New York City for the rest of my life, but The one of the I gotta be I gotta become New York old man.

16
00:01:00,401 --> 00:01:02,950
Speaker 0: where then people say look at that old New York, man.

17
00:01:03,231 --> 00:01:10,540
Speaker 1: Yep, I want to be that guy who's so old that like I know about the subway before whatever future stuff I'm sure old Michigan man.

18
00:01:10,561 --> 00:01:11,529
Speaker 0: You're not old New York, man.

19
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,025
Speaker 1: I can if when I'm 80, I'll just spend enough time in New York to where I'll qualify as old New York, man.

20
00:01:16,126 --> 00:01:23,450
Speaker 1: No, but So the thing that I miss from living in Michigan in the burbs.

21
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,331
Speaker 0: Hey, like I said, Michigan man Is.

22
00:01:25,391 --> 00:01:38,122
Speaker 1: that is this thing where whenever there's a big thunderstorm or like a tornado cuz they'd be tornadoes all the time It's not like when that one tornado Appeared for a brief instant in Brooklyn and everybody lost their shit.

23
00:01:38,163 --> 00:01:40,069
Speaker 1: This was like tornadoes were every week.

24
00:01:40,872 --> 00:01:44,103
Speaker 1: But what a normal person does when there's a crazy thunderstorm?

25
00:01:44,123 --> 00:01:53,470
Speaker 1: as they stay inside or maybe they go into their basement People in Michigan do is you open your garage door and you sit in the garage and watch the storm.

26
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,862
Speaker 0: I do that, only I do it from a window.

27
00:01:56,882 --> 00:01:57,685
Speaker 1: It's not the same.

28
00:01:57,725 --> 00:02:00,717
Speaker 0: You gotta be you're basically also Had a garage in my whole life.

29
00:02:01,199 --> 00:02:03,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, I uh, I do also miss.

30
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:05,117
Speaker 0: I've actually never ever.

31
00:02:05,137 --> 00:02:08,030
Speaker 0: I've always I've been to people's houses with garages plenty of times.

32
00:02:08,592 --> 00:02:12,550
Speaker 0: I never once actually lived in a place that had a garage.

33
00:02:12,811 --> 00:02:21,355
Speaker 1: I've only ever lived in two houses that didn't know they all had garages, but I've only lived in two places that had Detached garages everywhere.

34
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:21,656
Speaker 1: I live.

35
00:02:21,676 --> 00:02:22,901
Speaker 1: the garage was connected to the house.

36
00:02:22,921 --> 00:02:25,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know that everyone I knew had an attached garage.

37
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:32,458
Speaker 0: So it's like I. I oh no, I guess my grandparents had a tiny little Unattached garage that was on.

38
00:02:32,638 --> 00:02:34,164
Speaker 0: it was on the alley though in the back.

39
00:02:34,265 --> 00:02:35,550
Speaker 1: My grandpa pulled a scam though.

40
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:36,134
Speaker 1: Oh an alley.

41
00:02:36,194 --> 00:02:47,683
Speaker 0: I lived in a house that had an alley a long time ago But anyway The point is I went to people's houses with garages enough that I knew that when you had a garage You always entered your house from the door.

42
00:02:47,743 --> 00:02:48,990
Speaker 0: that goes into the house from the garage.

43
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:53,429
Speaker 0: Nobody entered their house like through the actual front door.

44
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:57,110
Speaker 0: But then it's like I'm like, why don't these people fucking ever use the front door?

45
00:02:57,572 --> 00:03:00,430
Speaker 0: They keep using the garage all the time actually, so I got a good.

46
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:02,560
Speaker 0: It's like even like even if you walk somewhere.

47
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,830
Speaker 0: shouldn't you then use the front door and not the garage?

48
00:03:05,030 --> 00:03:06,610
Speaker 0: Do I understand we just get out of your car?

49
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:10,343
Speaker 0: Well, if you walk somewhere, but it's like we used our front door if you want somewhere.

50
00:03:10,705 --> 00:03:11,969
Speaker 1: Why not use the side door?

51
00:03:13,031 --> 00:03:13,553
Speaker 0: We didn't have us.

52
00:03:13,613 --> 00:03:21,816
Speaker 0: if you only have a side door if you have a house with a garage like Architecture Did not have a side door.

53
00:03:21,856 --> 00:03:24,888
Speaker 1: that in front door in the back door side doors are as far as I can tell.

54
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:32,010
Speaker 1: I'm not sure If this is true like other shibboleths But I've really only encountered side doors in old houses in the Midwest and nowhere else.

55
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:39,679
Speaker 0: There are plenty of side door houses in the in the suburbs in Connecticut Like a sliding glass door like a door wall.

56
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,068
Speaker 1: No, no, it's like another front door that's on the side.

57
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:45,279
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah Yeah, that is it doesn't just go into the garage, right?

58
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:45,480
Speaker 0: Yeah.

59
00:03:45,721 --> 00:03:48,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, so what my grandparents house?

60
00:03:49,133 --> 00:03:50,460
Speaker 1: they built their house like.

61
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:55,989
Speaker 1: they built it themselves and The road moved at some point.

62
00:03:56,391 --> 00:04:02,930
Speaker 1: So they had a front door that went to a foyer and a living room that was pointed nowhere once the road moved.

63
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:05,418
Speaker 1: So that door basically never got opened again.

64
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,109
Speaker 0: There was a point not replace that door with a wall or They just left it.

65
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:12,690
Speaker 0: So there was vestigial a door that you can't actually open.

66
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:16,329
Speaker 0: So there was this living room because now someone can break in that door that you've let rust.

67
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:23,490
Speaker 1: There's a giant living room with a foyer and like a closet and all this stuff and this giant ass porch.

68
00:04:23,832 --> 00:04:24,434
Speaker 1: That's just like.

69
00:04:24,897 --> 00:04:27,329
Speaker 1: it's like a wing of the house that no one ever even went to anymore.

70
00:04:27,369 --> 00:04:27,791
Speaker 1: that door Like.

71
00:04:28,112 --> 00:04:32,170
Speaker 1: I opened that door once and it like creaked as I pushed it open with all the fries.

72
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:34,421
Speaker 0: You could actually open it without a hammer.

73
00:04:34,501 --> 00:04:36,290
Speaker 1: It's really well made house really well made door.

74
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:41,530
Speaker 1: My grandpa made it but they had a detached garage, but the garage was a scam.

75
00:04:42,472 --> 00:04:45,290
Speaker 1: It had a garage door that could not be opened.

76
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:51,210
Speaker 1: It was actually a gigantic multi-story woodworking shop that was illegal to build on the land.

77
00:04:51,752 --> 00:04:56,930
Speaker 1: So my grandpa had a permit to build a garage and he one of the walls just had a group.

78
00:04:57,091 --> 00:05:03,987
Speaker 1: There was a wall and behind the wall was a garage door That just looked on the outside like a real garage door that could not be open.

79
00:05:04,047 --> 00:05:10,990
Speaker 0: one of the bread books I have I think there's a story where the guy was trying to build some sort of bakery on his property.

80
00:05:11,091 --> 00:05:19,646
Speaker 0: They didn't let him so he moved Because it was some sort of HOA kind of fight, but then they had this cookbook about bread.

81
00:05:19,666 --> 00:05:23,589
Speaker 0: He's talking about fighting with the people in Portland or thereabouts.

82
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:28,710
Speaker 1: But the front door became a side door and then what they used as the front door was the old side door.

83
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:32,626
Speaker 1: But you know what it went to because the garage was fake and not attached carport.

84
00:05:33,108 --> 00:05:38,350
Speaker 1: Mmm I don't run into carports too much anymore except in I guess in some cities.

85
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:44,165
Speaker 0: So I learned the other day the ultra ultra ultra mega stupid evil rich people in the city.

86
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:49,464
Speaker 0: they have a thing nowadays Where you bring your car on the car elevator?

87
00:05:49,705 --> 00:05:50,610
Speaker 0: It's a car elevator.

88
00:05:50,771 --> 00:05:54,906
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw one of those in Queens that will bring your car to your apartment.

89
00:05:56,251 --> 00:05:58,650
Speaker 0: So you live on the 80th floor of some mega building?

90
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:03,729
Speaker 1: Oh, no I when I was talking to the car elevator where you drive up to one of those like rebuilt brownstones like those tiny.

91
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,513
Speaker 0: No, you live in the mega Down.

92
00:06:07,593 --> 00:06:21,490
Speaker 0: no, we're talking you in the skyscraper over there that the stick okay, and you they bring your car to your floor in your apartment and it's Separated in such a way that no fumes or sounds or anything will actually get into your apartment.

93
00:06:21,552 --> 00:06:24,981
Speaker 1: That's convenient but that means that it's very easy to get the guillotine in there.

94
00:06:25,061 --> 00:06:32,530
Speaker 0: you can put things in your car and Take them out of your car without having to like go all the way down to the garage because your car is in your apartment.

95
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:40,383
Speaker 0: So like you can unload your groceries right from the back of the car and such and such and then when you want to drive Somewhere you just put your car.

96
00:06:40,424 --> 00:06:41,370
Speaker 0: just you just push it.

97
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:46,331
Speaker 0: I don't know what you do push the button or something and then your car goes back down and then you go back down with It.

98
00:06:46,512 --> 00:06:49,649
Speaker 0: I guess you can get in the car and probably ride it down and then go straight out.

99
00:06:49,851 --> 00:06:50,902
Speaker 1: So here's what I don't get about that.

100
00:06:50,942 --> 00:06:53,860
Speaker 1: if you're that rich Why are you driving?

101
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:58,410
Speaker 0: Oh I mean your chauffeur can do the same thing and then they can unload the groceries.

102
00:06:58,994 --> 00:07:01,610
Speaker 0: But then you get out of the car and you're already in your apartment.

103
00:07:01,871 --> 00:07:02,413
Speaker 0: you can't.

104
00:07:02,433 --> 00:07:08,583
Speaker 0: you don't even need the umbrella to go to the front door of the building because you're in your car the whole time and You get out and you're already in your apartment.

105
00:07:08,825 --> 00:07:13,202
Speaker 1: I feel like Most people who are that rich would go once like that.

106
00:07:13,242 --> 00:07:14,970
Speaker 1: They just leave from the helicopter on the roof.

107
00:07:15,512 --> 00:07:25,298
Speaker 0: I'm just saying this is a thing that rich people have in some of the mega buildings in the city And I'm sure the other mega buildings that come from the future Want to compete with those.

108
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,209
Speaker 0: for rich people money will be providing the same.

109
00:07:28,013 --> 00:07:35,827
Speaker 1: The elevator I was talking about the one I saw in Queens is you drive your car to the tiny driveway and then the driveway Just sinks down and then a cover comes over the time.

110
00:07:35,927 --> 00:07:36,852
Speaker 0: It's not That's not.

111
00:07:37,154 --> 00:07:40,010
Speaker 1: I saw one of those like out in Queens and there's like way out.

112
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,456
Speaker 0: I mean that's nice, but that's not.

113
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:42,401
Speaker 0: that's not a rich person.

114
00:07:42,541 --> 00:07:42,923
Speaker 0: That's just.

115
00:07:42,963 --> 00:07:44,450
Speaker 0: it's not a wealthy person.

116
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,664
Speaker 0: Might be a rich person.

117
00:07:46,704 --> 00:07:54,599
Speaker 1: It's not a wealthy person Yep, so in the news the Overwatch League, which I watched the games But again, I literally do not care who wins.

118
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:57,210
Speaker 0: I got one New York to win because they are called New York.

119
00:07:57,290 --> 00:08:00,323
Speaker 1: Yep, I want New York to win because I want other people to say all that New York team.

120
00:08:00,504 --> 00:08:08,090
Speaker 0: and as far as I know So far the New York team has not had any revealed shit heads on it getting suspended for being a dick.

121
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:10,962
Speaker 0: I think some of the other teams have on top of that the New York team.

122
00:08:11,163 --> 00:08:13,857
Speaker 1: if they had much better than all the other Teams, it's a joke.

123
00:08:13,938 --> 00:08:14,623
Speaker 0: That's just by.

124
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:15,530
Speaker 0: is that by chance?

125
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,862
Speaker 0: I think it's by chance because the New York team is I believe all Koreans.

126
00:08:19,063 --> 00:08:20,910
Speaker 1: I think it's more by Moneyball.

127
00:08:21,213 --> 00:08:22,690
Speaker 1: I think it's a Yankees situation.

128
00:08:23,212 --> 00:08:27,590
Speaker 0: The point is is that the New York team has nothing to do with New York beyond its name.

129
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:32,453
Speaker 1: So the New York stiff whatsoever for tiebreakers is plus 83.

130
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:34,671
Speaker 1: The next team down the valiant is 36.

131
00:08:34,671 --> 00:08:36,921
Speaker 1: So that gives you a sense of the differential numbers.

132
00:08:37,303 --> 00:08:40,918
Speaker 0: in terms of their records New York Well, at least that means overwatch has a high skill cap.

133
00:08:40,938 --> 00:08:43,227
Speaker 1: Yeah, New York went 34 and 6 for the season.

134
00:08:44,331 --> 00:08:46,298
Speaker 0: Uh-huh was the next best record 27 and 13.

135
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:51,616
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, and it's all real close in that middle tier but Down to the bottom.

136
00:08:52,117 --> 00:08:53,643
Speaker 1: so Florida mayhem was second to last.

137
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:54,727
Speaker 1: they only won seven games.

138
00:08:54,967 --> 00:09:05,381
Speaker 1: Yeah good but The Shanghai Dragons already have set a record Like so it's the first year of the real.

139
00:09:05,581 --> 00:09:05,862
Speaker 0: are they?

140
00:09:06,043 --> 00:09:06,183
Speaker 0: oh?

141
00:09:06,284 --> 00:09:07,066
Speaker 0: are they oh?

142
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:08,391
Speaker 1: and they're oh and 40.

143
00:09:08,391 --> 00:09:09,054
Speaker 0: They have not won.

144
00:09:09,094 --> 00:09:12,990
Speaker 0: a single man did not win a single match even against the Florida team.

145
00:09:13,272 --> 00:09:15,370
Speaker 1: No, the Florida team beat them every time they competed.

146
00:09:15,491 --> 00:09:17,279
Speaker 0: They couldn't even win one match against.

147
00:09:17,922 --> 00:09:22,983
Speaker 0: in the map breakdown meaning Individual matter they draft these players originally.

148
00:09:23,003 --> 00:09:24,329
Speaker 1: Ah, I don't know.

149
00:09:24,791 --> 00:09:27,845
Speaker 0: I do not know why I don't know how the teams were constructed originally.

150
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:28,970
Speaker 0: just sort of appeared right?

151
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:29,853
Speaker 1: I didn't watch any.

152
00:09:29,934 --> 00:09:30,255
Speaker 0: I don't think.

153
00:09:30,577 --> 00:09:33,310
Speaker 0: I don't think they like published any of that information.

154
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:33,732
Speaker 0: I didn't.

155
00:09:33,853 --> 00:09:36,566
Speaker 1: I only watched games that happened to be on like like.

156
00:09:36,667 --> 00:09:37,290
Speaker 1: Oh overwatch.

157
00:09:37,331 --> 00:09:37,848
Speaker 0: Yeah, me too.

158
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,623
Speaker 0: So like I would turn out like I would open up twitch be like.

159
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:41,829
Speaker 0: is there anything streaming right now?

160
00:09:42,271 --> 00:09:44,350
Speaker 0: And if I saw it there, it would usually be on the front of twitch.

161
00:09:44,470 --> 00:09:48,870
Speaker 1: I ended up seeing some Spitfire and some Philadelphia, but I didn't actually see any Shanghai dragons games.

162
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:50,229
Speaker 0: I did not see any Shanghai dragons.

163
00:09:50,531 --> 00:09:54,569
Speaker 1: I want to go back and find when Shanghai played New York and watch that game and that's what I'm gonna do tonight.

164
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:55,567
Speaker 1: I think all right go.

165
00:09:56,532 --> 00:09:59,010
Speaker 1: That's like watching the Buffalo Sabres play against literally.

166
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:03,568
Speaker 0: I think what you want to do is watch Shanghai versus, Florida and see.

167
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:05,619
Speaker 0: you know What the difference is that made.

168
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:07,330
Speaker 0: that made Shanghai so bad?

169
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:11,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz Florida is still bad couldn't even win one like.

170
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:12,230
Speaker 1: not one game.

171
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,455
Speaker 0: Like I haven't even played over.

172
00:10:13,636 --> 00:10:15,263
Speaker 0: one won a hockey game or two.

173
00:10:15,303 --> 00:10:18,116
Speaker 0: like I've never played overwatch And they should.

174
00:10:18,136 --> 00:10:26,290
Speaker 0: I mean I'm not I haven't played FPS is in a while But knowing this I feel confident like I could be a somewhat okay addition to at least the bench.

175
00:10:26,493 --> 00:10:27,470
Speaker 0: Oh, it's got Shanghai team.

176
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:31,790
Speaker 1: I'll say this I'm confident despite having not played FPS is in a long time and having not played over.

177
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,674
Speaker 1: I'm also confident.

178
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:35,589
Speaker 0: I wouldn't probably even hit anyone with a single bullet on the New York team.

179
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,842
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm pretty sure if you did the competitive ranking now.

180
00:10:38,943 --> 00:10:43,781
Speaker 0: I'm also confident if I join the New York team I wouldn't sandbag them so badly that they would lose.

181
00:10:44,082 --> 00:10:44,644
Speaker 1: I think you would.

182
00:10:44,704 --> 00:10:45,347
Speaker 0: they're so good.

183
00:10:45,367 --> 00:10:47,698
Speaker 1: I think you would Sandbag them so bad.

184
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:50,210
Speaker 0: the uh not against Shanghai.

185
00:10:51,395 --> 00:10:56,446
Speaker 0: It's hard to say One bad player can really ruin it to me and the rest of the people in all.

186
00:10:56,466 --> 00:10:57,530
Speaker 0: New York against Shanghai.

187
00:10:57,652 --> 00:11:00,695
Speaker 1: I think we go in Only if you stayed in spawn.

188
00:11:00,715 --> 00:11:08,764
Speaker 0: don't go out of spawn if it's me playing basketball with LeBron Michael Jordan Magic Johnson Shaq Against you know the Phoenix Suns.

189
00:11:09,005 --> 00:11:10,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, we're gonna win.

190
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:13,664
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying, but I'm pretty sure if you don't pass me the ball.

191
00:11:13,765 --> 00:11:15,050
Speaker 0: I get in someone's way occasionally.

192
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:22,549
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure if you just picked up overwatch and played it today like if you just went home and Did the ranking matches for the current competitive season pretty sure you'd be silver?

193
00:11:23,351 --> 00:11:26,950
Speaker 1: Which is already better than a huge percentage of overwatch players, which is terrifying.

194
00:11:27,473 --> 00:11:30,528
Speaker 1: Meanwhile silver is considered like unworthy of playing with.

195
00:11:30,548 --> 00:11:32,376
Speaker 0: well I'd have to I'd have to I'd.

196
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,307
Speaker 0: I probably have to ask professor you you know what the strats are?

197
00:11:35,327 --> 00:11:40,503
Speaker 1: yeah Honestly Basic team coordination and basic FPS skills.

198
00:11:40,544 --> 00:11:41,850
Speaker 1: I get you a long way in this game.

199
00:11:42,532 --> 00:11:44,166
Speaker 1: Like you would do better than a lot of people.

200
00:11:45,831 --> 00:11:50,450
Speaker 1: So yeah, Shanghai, I don't know what happened, but the playoffs are in July the brackets are out.

201
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:52,338
Speaker 0: When did the season start?

202
00:11:52,701 --> 00:11:56,963
Speaker 0: I don't even remember but It feels like it's been going on a long time.

203
00:11:56,983 --> 00:11:58,250
Speaker 0: like did this take longer than a year?

204
00:11:58,652 --> 00:11:59,216
Speaker 1: No, but they did.

205
00:11:59,216 --> 00:12:01,430
Speaker 1: 40 matches took a while like at the teams going.

206
00:12:02,251 --> 00:12:04,017
Speaker 0: It's a lot of matches for not a lot of teams.

207
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:10,399
Speaker 1: New York and LA are the division winners who are Seated in the tournament and get the buys or whatever gonna buy.

208
00:12:10,439 --> 00:12:13,790
Speaker 1: yeah, and the wildcards are Boston LA London and Philadelphia.

209
00:12:13,971 --> 00:12:17,124
Speaker 0: It's nice to know that things like like the last time I checked the standings.

210
00:12:17,184 --> 00:12:18,650
Speaker 0: It was a New York and London.

211
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:24,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, so it's nice to see that the the teams weren't so static and just like it wasn't a foregone conclusion.

212
00:12:24,690 --> 00:12:25,355
Speaker 0: What's gonna happen?

213
00:12:25,395 --> 00:12:27,390
Speaker 0: like even though it seems like New York's gonna win?

214
00:12:27,851 --> 00:12:28,353
Speaker 0: They could lose.

215
00:12:28,533 --> 00:12:33,970
Speaker 1: also there was a race for the wildcard slots the soul and definitely if you like other than the top.

216
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,350
Speaker 0: You know those middle teams is you know, always a lot of action going on.

217
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,679
Speaker 0: Well, you know what the kind of like.

218
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,795
Speaker 0: it's a lot like the NFL in that way We talk about.

219
00:12:40,815 --> 00:12:42,070
Speaker 0: it seems like NFL playoff.

220
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:46,203
Speaker 1: You need a bad team or a bad experience sometimes to remind you what it's like.

221
00:12:46,644 --> 00:12:50,776
Speaker 1: Shanghai is the super agree Of this Cleveland Browns.

222
00:12:50,977 --> 00:12:52,986
Speaker 0: Yeah, you need a Cleveland Browns.

223
00:12:53,127 --> 00:12:53,930
Speaker 1: Yeah, you need a Newman.

224
00:12:55,131 --> 00:13:01,736
Speaker 1: So in some other news and this one's really funny to me because I don't care I also don't care but Fortnight like it or not.

225
00:13:02,058 --> 00:13:04,008
Speaker 1: Just like that decide the game is good or bad.

226
00:13:04,048 --> 00:13:05,575
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter It's the biggest game.

227
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:07,704
Speaker 1: now like you cannot it is big.

228
00:13:07,744 --> 00:13:09,010
Speaker 1: There's reasons why it's big.

229
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:12,310
Speaker 1: It's gonna be minecraft 2 in terms of like pop culture.

230
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:15,750
Speaker 0: Well, you know, you don't have to worry though cuz it's not gonna be the game forever.

231
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:20,510
Speaker 0: World of Warcraft wasn't the game forever, you know, no game has ever lasted forever.

232
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:28,210
Speaker 0: Replace you're like better serious games or games games that are big enough even though they may rise and fall.

233
00:13:28,813 --> 00:13:31,687
Speaker 0: Oh, you know games that have at some point been big enough.

234
00:13:31,868 --> 00:13:38,109
Speaker 0: Yep Once you reach this sort of critical point where your game was at some time large it lives.

235
00:13:38,189 --> 00:13:39,494
Speaker 0: now It won't be.

236
00:13:39,614 --> 00:13:44,110
Speaker 0: it won't stay the biggest but it lives like World of Warcraft no longer anywhere near the biggest.

237
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:45,055
Speaker 0: It's alive.

238
00:13:45,135 --> 00:13:46,382
Speaker 0: It is solidly alive.

239
00:13:46,703 --> 00:13:47,970
Speaker 0: rocket League is solidly alive.

240
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,741
Speaker 1: Solidly alive is gonna survive.

241
00:13:50,781 --> 00:13:52,653
Speaker 0: this pub G is decreasing But it will.

242
00:13:52,673 --> 00:13:58,690
Speaker 0: then it will eventually reach a point where it much like counter-strike It is just solidly alive, you know hardstone solidly.

243
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,075
Speaker 0: All these games are just.

244
00:14:00,336 --> 00:14:06,409
Speaker 0: they go up they get big then they go back down and they stabilize And we're only the people who are dedicated to them.

245
00:14:07,073 --> 00:14:12,819
Speaker 0: Stay there and don't move very much or they keep coming back to that game Even though they may visit other games from time to time.

246
00:14:13,281 --> 00:14:14,626
Speaker 0: and that's what fortnight's gonna do.

247
00:14:14,706 --> 00:14:15,550
Speaker 0: It's big right now.

248
00:14:16,031 --> 00:14:19,063
Speaker 0: It'll go back down and then it will solidify just like the rest.

249
00:14:19,304 --> 00:14:25,064
Speaker 1: but an important thing about Fortnight and this is actually a really big deal is that it's doing something.

250
00:14:25,105 --> 00:14:26,670
Speaker 1: that one we've said people should do a long.

251
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:28,302
Speaker 1: That one panel we didn't video.

252
00:14:28,322 --> 00:14:32,842
Speaker 1: we talked about this a bunch But more games are doing it and we're better positioned to do it.

253
00:14:33,203 --> 00:14:35,872
Speaker 1: for tonight is on every goddamn platform There is.

254
00:14:36,073 --> 00:14:48,128
Speaker 0: well because it's built on the Unreal Engine which is on and it's made by the company that makes the Unreal Engine Is what can build for every console and every mobile platform and everything you can play on your ps4.

255
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:51,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, my brother your Xbox or your cell phone.

256
00:14:51,986 --> 00:14:52,810
Speaker 0: My brother's into it.

257
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,112
Speaker 0: He was.

258
00:14:53,132 --> 00:14:55,049
Speaker 0: he was trying to like get me to join.

259
00:14:55,231 --> 00:14:57,238
Speaker 0: Oh hell no He's trying to get me to join on.

260
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,950
Speaker 0: he's playing on his phone or his iPad.

261
00:14:59,534 --> 00:15:00,218
Speaker 0: He was trying to eat.

262
00:15:00,238 --> 00:15:02,312
Speaker 0: like sent me a met like one of those messages I think.

263
00:15:02,332 --> 00:15:04,729
Speaker 0: if I joined I think I think he would have gotten loot or something.

264
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:06,877
Speaker 0: But then he's like no you switch.

265
00:15:06,918 --> 00:15:07,118
Speaker 0: he's.

266
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:09,226
Speaker 0: now he's playing it on the switch instead of it on the phone.

267
00:15:09,246 --> 00:15:11,755
Speaker 1: because the switch probably Honestly, having looked at the game.

268
00:15:12,297 --> 00:15:15,369
Speaker 1: I think the Nintendo switch is the best form factor for the game not PC.

269
00:15:16,673 --> 00:15:17,705
Speaker 0: Yes, though, right?

270
00:15:17,907 --> 00:15:25,249
Speaker 1: Ah Yeah, it's an FPS in the same way that Team Fortress 2 is an FPS, okay But yeah It's like he's sweet.

271
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:31,091
Speaker 1: He now plays it on the switch instead like the switch is in my opinion having not really played the game other than like looking At it.

272
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,381
Speaker 1: It is the best platform for the game.

273
00:15:33,401 --> 00:15:34,265
Speaker 0: I mean, it's also free.

274
00:15:34,345 --> 00:15:35,330
Speaker 0: So it's like we could try it.

275
00:15:35,471 --> 00:15:40,490
Speaker 1: But Game has cross play and that it doesn't care what platform you're on.

276
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:41,657
Speaker 1: It's just everybody play.

277
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:43,530
Speaker 1: you have an account everybody play.

278
00:15:43,570 --> 00:15:46,223
Speaker 0: Yeah, the people on phones are playing against people on PC, right?

279
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:47,530
Speaker 1: You can use your same account.

280
00:15:47,591 --> 00:15:48,390
Speaker 1: You can have an account.

281
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,446
Speaker 0: Rocket League does that you play against PlayStation people on.

282
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:58,010
Speaker 1: when you're on PC You can play on the switch and also play on the phone with your same account and track it like it's all the same.

283
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,118
Speaker 0: Well, cuz you've done suck.

284
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:04,270
Speaker 0: if you got a bunch of because it's free to play a game If you got a bunch of loot and then suddenly you switch platforms and your loots gone.

285
00:16:04,692 --> 00:16:08,049
Speaker 0: The news I got the same hearthstone cards on my iPad as they do on my PC.

286
00:16:08,311 --> 00:16:14,690
Speaker 1: So the news and this is pretty important if I didn't I would be fucking Bad news because Sony is kind of effed here.

287
00:16:15,911 --> 00:16:19,664
Speaker 1: All the crossplay works on all the platforms except the ps4.

288
00:16:19,724 --> 00:16:27,325
Speaker 0: I don't understand why the ps4 is the one Rocket League worked like Xbox is the one left out for Rocket League.

289
00:16:27,526 --> 00:16:28,530
Speaker 0: you could Rocket League.

290
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:32,770
Speaker 0: It was like PC and PlayStation and then I think Nintendo switch did get in.

291
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:36,046
Speaker 0: I'm not sure but like those are the only two they played together.

292
00:16:36,167 --> 00:16:37,113
Speaker 1: So here's the deal It's like.

293
00:16:37,174 --> 00:16:38,289
Speaker 0: why would they leave it out now?

294
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:38,990
Speaker 1: What?

295
00:16:39,091 --> 00:16:44,430
Speaker 1: what they've specifically blocked is you if you have an account in fortnight?

296
00:16:45,190 --> 00:16:52,549
Speaker 1: you can either play only ps4 with that account or Any and all other platforms combined forever?

297
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,115
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, you cannot.

298
00:16:54,256 --> 00:16:58,138
Speaker 1: if an account has ever played on a switch You can't use that account on a ps4.

299
00:16:58,881 --> 00:17:06,468
Speaker 1: and if you've ever played on a ps4 You can't use that account on your switch, but if I'm playing on PC, am I gonna play against people who are on ps4s?

300
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:08,836
Speaker 1: I don't actually know.

301
00:17:08,915 --> 00:17:10,827
Speaker 1: cuz no, I don't no one cares about that.

302
00:17:11,229 --> 00:17:14,829
Speaker 1: Sony Okay, so he's refused to even allow crossplay between ps4 rival counsel.

303
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:20,193
Speaker 0: Okay, so that answers that for several other games, but rocket league they allow it But not anyone.

304
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:21,738
Speaker 1: Xbox switch fortnight.

305
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,163
Speaker 1: That's not the news.

306
00:17:23,223 --> 00:17:25,329
Speaker 1: The news is that they're locking the accounts out.

307
00:17:25,590 --> 00:17:36,930
Speaker 0: So a bunch of people got Nintendo switches and they said oh, I want to play on switch now instead of PlayStation On PlayStation and they won't let them log in on switch because their account is locked to PlayStation.

308
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:39,023
Speaker 0: And I'm pretty sure they want to play on switch.

309
00:17:39,043 --> 00:17:40,210
Speaker 0: They have to buy all new loot.

310
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:46,124
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the reason for this is that fortnight is the example.

311
00:17:46,185 --> 00:17:59,870
Speaker 1: now like fortnight is gonna be one of the things that breaks the idea of platform exclusives for real because it's that big and Nintendo has their first party stuff, but they're not gonna release their games on other platforms.

312
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,696
Speaker 1: They don't need to worry about that Sony.

313
00:18:01,716 --> 00:18:09,017
Speaker 1: if fortnight becomes just popular in and of itself and it's the game and Kids don't need a PlayStation 4 to play it.

314
00:18:09,438 --> 00:18:11,424
Speaker 1: They're not gonna buy a PlayStation 4.

315
00:18:11,424 --> 00:18:13,470
Speaker 0: They'll just buy whatever plays fortnight.

316
00:18:13,954 --> 00:18:14,236
Speaker 1: Yep.

317
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,970
Speaker 0: I just need a thing that plays fortnight.

318
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,288
Speaker 0: I don't care which thing it is.

319
00:18:17,771 --> 00:18:30,901
Speaker 1: And if there's a cross play if the world gets to the point to where the biggest games work on any platform Sony is the one who's hurt the most by that I think because Microsoft PC gaming master is Microsoft.

320
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:32,995
Speaker 1: the Xbox They could easily.

321
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:37,510
Speaker 0: any cross-platform game is effectively a PC game that has been ported to everything.

322
00:18:37,771 --> 00:18:38,513
Speaker 1: Microsoft.

323
00:18:38,613 --> 00:18:41,782
Speaker 0: if they write for a PC game that's been ported everything's.

324
00:18:42,123 --> 00:18:46,469
Speaker 0: if you have a game that is running on one of those multi-platform Engines, it's a PC game.

325
00:18:46,711 --> 00:18:47,614
Speaker 1: It's a Microsoft.

326
00:18:47,654 --> 00:18:48,557
Speaker 1: the way the Xbox is.

327
00:18:48,778 --> 00:18:51,869
Speaker 1: they could easily turn the Xbox into just a like.

328
00:18:52,170 --> 00:18:54,806
Speaker 0: Microsoft seems to be trying to turn Windows 10 into a Xbox.

329
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:57,718
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think they're gonna go down that road real.

330
00:18:57,758 --> 00:18:58,180
Speaker 1: eventually.

331
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,144
Speaker 0: you got Xbox.

332
00:18:59,164 --> 00:19:00,830
Speaker 0: you got Xbox apps and settings.

333
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:01,914
Speaker 0: Yeah, Windows 10 already.

334
00:19:01,954 --> 00:19:06,270
Speaker 1: I think eventually Windows PC will also be effectively Xbox and I bet they'll sell an Xbox.

335
00:19:06,391 --> 00:19:09,090
Speaker 1: That's actually just a Windows PC with set hardware Like.

336
00:19:09,131 --> 00:19:09,873
Speaker 1: I think that's coming.

337
00:19:10,454 --> 00:19:25,051
Speaker 1: Sony does not have that luxury and Sony is very very deeply invested in the idea of platform exclusives and some reason for their platform to be special and I think Sony's fucked in the long Run because of all this.

338
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:33,470
Speaker 1: Well, I think what's also gonna happen right is oh people are mad Sony fanboys are mad People are like, I think this is gonna really hurt Sony.

339
00:19:33,490 --> 00:19:37,250
Speaker 0: I think this specific thing I could think there could be a lawsuit coming for sure.

340
00:19:37,371 --> 00:19:43,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I think so I bet Sony's gonna back down but I bet backing down is actually bad for them in the long run.

341
00:19:43,833 --> 00:19:44,316
Speaker 1: I think not.

342
00:19:44,356 --> 00:19:46,170
Speaker 1: backing down is also bad for them in the long run.

343
00:19:46,571 --> 00:19:48,379
Speaker 1: I think it's just bad for Sony in the long run.

344
00:19:48,399 --> 00:19:51,832
Speaker 0: the two major things I see coming in the in terms of Cross-platform.

345
00:19:51,852 --> 00:19:57,330
Speaker 0: this in the in the not-too-distant future is one all the companies that make games.

346
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:03,390
Speaker 0: They want you to stream games and not buy them so that they can control that everything and not have any piracy and etc.

347
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,830
Speaker 0: Etc, and they're gonna push for that even if people don't want it or even if it sucks because everyone's internet connection sucks.

348
00:20:08,911 --> 00:20:09,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

349
00:20:09,991 --> 00:20:13,430
Speaker 0: So they're gonna try to get that but they won't be able to because internet connections are too bad.

350
00:20:13,971 --> 00:20:24,811
Speaker 0: And the other thing that's gonna happen is you're gonna see people are gonna start using things like Apple TV Steam link, it's a you know, the you know Chrome Whatever's.

351
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:29,385
Speaker 0: and now basically all games will be phone games.

352
00:20:29,445 --> 00:20:31,170
Speaker 0: You just play your phone game on the TV.

353
00:20:31,350 --> 00:20:32,798
Speaker 0: You won't need the switch like that's.

354
00:20:32,838 --> 00:20:36,714
Speaker 0: the next generation of console is basically No console.

355
00:20:36,734 --> 00:20:42,670
Speaker 0: you just whatever device you have just streams to the TV because everyone already has these fucking things, right?

356
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:45,526
Speaker 0: It's like I'll just play a phone game and chromecast to my TV.

357
00:20:45,546 --> 00:20:46,150
Speaker 0: Congratulations.

358
00:20:46,572 --> 00:20:51,490
Speaker 1: iOS is now on par with a ps4 and frankly even the like super serious PC gamers.

359
00:20:51,611 --> 00:20:59,290
Speaker 1: I feel like they'll have a sweet PC gaming rig They spent $6,000 on but then it will stream to all the other devices in their local cloud.

360
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:02,923
Speaker 1: so we'll see what happens with this.

361
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:16,682
Speaker 1: Sony is Really really trying to avoid making a definitive statement Because they realize they're F on this and the statement they released was kind of like it was pathetic Even by the standards of stone is off.

362
00:21:16,702 --> 00:21:21,429
Speaker 1: Sony press releases In some other news that really affects Scott.

363
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:28,330
Speaker 0: So this is actually like a weird news because it's a surprise but also not a surprise.

364
00:21:28,410 --> 00:21:31,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, it was not a surprise, but I think the surprise was that it happened.

365
00:21:31,787 --> 00:21:33,879
Speaker 1: So suddenly Yes, the timing came.

366
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,710
Speaker 0: the timing came earlier than expected.

367
00:21:36,132 --> 00:21:42,292
Speaker 1: I thought that you saw this coming in the long run and I expected a situation where they Can't like.

368
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:48,316
Speaker 1: the game continued to exist but they were making less and less money on it and we're like like Fewer updates come out.

369
00:21:48,577 --> 00:21:51,146
Speaker 0: So anyway, yeah back in the day, right?

370
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:52,250
Speaker 0: We came to the city.

371
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:56,130
Speaker 0: We were going to board game night and board game night had problems, you know, people were slow.

372
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,216
Speaker 0: They weren't playing to win.

373
00:21:57,236 --> 00:21:57,417
Speaker 0: yet.

374
00:21:57,477 --> 00:21:58,121
Speaker 0: teach rules.

375
00:21:58,584 --> 00:21:59,569
Speaker 0: I discovered netrunner.

376
00:21:59,850 --> 00:22:03,104
Speaker 0: I just saw this really cool fucking game on the board game geek list, right?

377
00:22:03,164 --> 00:22:03,646
Speaker 0: I bought it.

378
00:22:03,907 --> 00:22:04,550
Speaker 0: I played it.

379
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,086
Speaker 0: I thought it was just a two-player card game.

380
00:22:06,106 --> 00:22:08,296
Speaker 0: Nope It's actually what you wanted your whole life.

381
00:22:08,336 --> 00:22:09,822
Speaker 0: that already existed and you didn't know.

382
00:22:09,842 --> 00:22:13,982
Speaker 0: again a customizable card game like magic Except you don't have to collect the car as an aside.

383
00:22:14,002 --> 00:22:19,001
Speaker 0: I noticed something interesting Net runner and it was cyberpunk and it was a great game.

384
00:22:19,141 --> 00:22:27,249
Speaker 1: netrunner and overwatch were both the games We dreamed of when we were young and now that we're old they both came out and we each could only pick one.

385
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:35,610
Speaker 0: So I said, holy shit, I didn't realize that's what this was that this was more exactly what I wanted.

386
00:22:35,751 --> 00:22:39,269
Speaker 0: So I got way into it and I started going to netrunner instead of going to board game night.

387
00:22:40,651 --> 00:22:53,679
Speaker 0: So netrunner when I the first netrunner I just like I didn't even realize the deal with it that it was a. you know originally that it was a Richard Garfield game for the 90s that went away and came back even though when I saw that original box Art I was like, I remember seeing that in the store.

388
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,730
Speaker 0: Yep, never bought it anyway.

389
00:22:56,631 --> 00:23:05,730
Speaker 0: But the first one thing I noticed very early on I think it was the very first netrunner tournament I went to when I saw the prize playmat that they were gonna give to whoever won the tournament.

390
00:23:05,871 --> 00:23:07,059
Speaker 0: It was one of the first tournaments.

391
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,750
Speaker 0: I don't think the very first one had play mats.

392
00:23:09,851 --> 00:23:22,970
Speaker 0: There were three different logos on the fucking playmat from companies right those fantasy flight games who actually made that the new current Soon to end netrunner right who also makes x-wing and such and such and are now owned by asthma day.

393
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:29,590
Speaker 0: There was a logo for Wizards of the Coast which made sense because they made the original netrunner Richard Garfield and such.

394
00:23:30,212 --> 00:23:34,610
Speaker 0: And there was a third one which is now also relevant for our Talsorian games.

395
00:23:34,670 --> 00:23:37,022
Speaker 0: You know our Talsorian games and I do not.

396
00:23:37,102 --> 00:23:43,968
Speaker 0: they made the cyberpunk 2020 RP tabletop RPG which is now getting a video game version coming soon, right?

397
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,181
Speaker 0: It's all in the news that everyone's excited about right?

398
00:23:47,361 --> 00:23:53,944
Speaker 0: because that original netrunner card game The theme of it was in that cyberpunk universe, right?

399
00:23:53,964 --> 00:23:55,770
Speaker 0: So they had some legal right to it.

400
00:23:55,890 --> 00:24:03,082
Speaker 0: So kind of fantasy flight games was licensing netrunner from both Watsy and our Talsorian.

401
00:24:03,424 --> 00:24:09,166
Speaker 0: in order to produce this thing They were paying this license fee, which is what fantasy flight games mostly makes most of their money on.

402
00:24:09,207 --> 00:24:10,150
Speaker 0: they have a Star Wars license.

403
00:24:10,512 --> 00:24:10,974
Speaker 0: They had.

404
00:24:10,994 --> 00:24:14,770
Speaker 0: they previously had the games workshop license.

405
00:24:16,011 --> 00:24:16,714
Speaker 0: What are the licenses?

406
00:24:16,754 --> 00:24:17,677
Speaker 0: do they have?

407
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,986
Speaker 0: Oh the the Game of Thrones license is big for them.

408
00:24:20,026 --> 00:24:21,070
Speaker 0: They still have that, right?

409
00:24:21,351 --> 00:24:23,357
Speaker 0: That's what fantasy flight games mostly does.

410
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:26,930
Speaker 0: is they like get licensed properties and make games based on them?

411
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:27,594
Speaker 0: Oh, they got some.

412
00:24:27,614 --> 00:24:36,065
Speaker 0: they're currently publishing T&E, I guess whatever Some other things Citadel's anyway, so when I saw that I said man this game.

413
00:24:36,606 --> 00:24:45,351
Speaker 0: if any of these three people Mostly the not the FFG one They're the ones who are making the game but it's like any of these two other people just pull the plug on this at any Time.

414
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:48,265
Speaker 0: we have no idea the licensing agreement is there's any moment.

415
00:24:48,346 --> 00:24:50,137
Speaker 0: Watsy could just be like, you know We don't want you doing that.

416
00:24:50,178 --> 00:24:57,890
Speaker 0: run it no more the end Right, so netrunner went on and it rose and it you know waxed and waned at various points, right?

417
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,690
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's been waning slightly.

418
00:24:59,791 --> 00:25:02,590
Speaker 0: I haven't played it that much in the past six months or whatever.

419
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:07,850
Speaker 0: But you know, I'm still buying all the cards and following along with the community and seeing what's up.

420
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:10,384
Speaker 0: You know and if I'm really got nothing to do then I go.

421
00:25:10,464 --> 00:25:11,450
Speaker 0: I still go play netrunner.

422
00:25:11,732 --> 00:25:21,970
Speaker 0: you know, I met a lot of people playing netrunner as good times and Suddenly we see a news on the fantasy flight website like a week or two ago Jacking out netrunner is done.

423
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:25,241
Speaker 0: We did not we were did not renew the license with Watsy.

424
00:25:25,863 --> 00:25:29,534
Speaker 0: and it's like on the one hand I totally saw that coming years ago.

425
00:25:29,554 --> 00:25:31,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, but on the other hand, it's like whoa.

426
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:35,680
Speaker 0: You just announced like this new box that's coming at the end of the year.

427
00:25:36,081 --> 00:25:39,030
Speaker 0: You're in the middle of a cycle of cards, right?

428
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:42,564
Speaker 1: It's like you're gonna release that last box apparently rain and reverie.

429
00:25:42,604 --> 00:25:44,070
Speaker 1: Yes expansion exactly.

430
00:25:44,191 --> 00:25:45,698
Speaker 0: So they got all this stuff going on it.

431
00:25:46,101 --> 00:25:50,159
Speaker 0: This did not, you know The none of the play testers like we're like.

432
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,246
Speaker 0: we stopped getting new cards to play test.

433
00:25:52,267 --> 00:25:54,214
Speaker 0: Like there was no Whiff of this.

434
00:25:54,234 --> 00:25:58,890
Speaker 0: so obviously we'll probably never find out what the story was or it will be greatly.

435
00:25:59,031 --> 00:26:00,850
Speaker 0: We'll have to get inside in front of the story.

436
00:26:01,350 --> 00:26:02,874
Speaker 1: Monetization stream was drying out.

437
00:26:02,914 --> 00:26:05,803
Speaker 0: There's a lot of suspicions that all make sense.

438
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:12,218
Speaker 0: So it's hard to know which one is right, but clearly FFG Wanted to keep this license active.

439
00:26:12,499 --> 00:26:22,310
Speaker 0: obviously because they had didn't look like they were planning to end it and They weren't able to reach an agreement with Watsy and or art alsorian games to continue the netrunner license.

440
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:26,408
Speaker 0: So they're stopping the game the end once they release that box.

441
00:26:26,448 --> 00:26:26,950
Speaker 0: It's all over.

442
00:26:28,734 --> 00:26:29,905
Speaker 0: So there's a few things happening.

443
00:26:29,945 --> 00:26:38,593
Speaker 0: number one The community is forming its own Organization to keep netrunner alive because the community is way strong and the game hasn't waned to the point where it makes sense to kill The game.

444
00:26:38,896 --> 00:26:40,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you've got all the cards.

445
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:45,711
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean if you look at some of the other FFG games that did wane like the Cthulhu one or the Lord of the Rings One.

446
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:53,202
Speaker 0: they like reduced the production schedules and did other things to slow the game down But keep selling product and to fade it out.

447
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:54,930
Speaker 0: They did not do that with netrunner.

448
00:26:55,493 --> 00:26:55,956
Speaker 0: They were going.

449
00:26:55,976 --> 00:26:58,410
Speaker 0: they were still going at full steam when it when this happened.

450
00:26:59,092 --> 00:27:04,130
Speaker 0: Another thing that's happening is that all those they're not reprinting anything because they can't they don't have time.

451
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:06,078
Speaker 0: So that rain and reverie box.

452
00:27:06,118 --> 00:27:06,459
Speaker 0: I've heard.

453
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:09,932
Speaker 0: there's a lot of reports that have no evidence behind them But they're like man.

454
00:27:10,273 --> 00:27:13,502
Speaker 0: Canada's only all of Canada's getting 200 boxes the end.

455
00:27:13,522 --> 00:27:16,210
Speaker 0: Yeah stuff like that is going around the rumor mills.

456
00:27:16,692 --> 00:27:20,550
Speaker 0: So there's gonna be a mad dash if every netrunner players like go and get one of these.

457
00:27:20,911 --> 00:27:31,542
Speaker 0: So they can have a full set of netrunner which you're gonna need because there'll be no way in the future to get any netrunner Unless you find someone who's selling theirs or something like that.

458
00:27:31,563 --> 00:27:33,769
Speaker 1: Just republish the game or remove all the Android IP.

459
00:27:34,491 --> 00:27:35,977
Speaker 0: Well, the Android I don't care.

460
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:36,659
Speaker 1: I'll be honest.

461
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:39,089
Speaker 1: This is the thing that I'll I don't give a shit about.

462
00:27:39,109 --> 00:27:39,229
Speaker 1: the.

463
00:27:39,249 --> 00:27:44,561
Speaker 0: well No FFG the Android IP that is what FFG owns.

464
00:27:44,602 --> 00:27:45,225
Speaker 0: They made a game.

465
00:27:45,346 --> 00:27:46,130
Speaker 0: They made a game called.

466
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:47,496
Speaker 1: That's the part I care about the least.

467
00:27:47,777 --> 00:27:50,710
Speaker 0: they made a game called Android that you can play.

468
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:52,038
Speaker 0: They also made what's it called?

469
00:27:52,058 --> 00:27:53,204
Speaker 0: You got your infiltration.

470
00:27:53,245 --> 00:27:53,828
Speaker 0: That's Android.

471
00:27:53,848 --> 00:27:57,247
Speaker 0: Yeah it's a lot of the art and that and characters are the same as a netrunner.

472
00:27:57,629 --> 00:28:00,488
Speaker 0: that FFG fully owns the Android IP.

473
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:11,855
Speaker 0: I'm not exactly sure like why they can't make a game just called Android the card game and have it have the same rules as netrunner and tweak it a little bit and Just stop calling it netrunner.

474
00:28:11,875 --> 00:28:16,916
Speaker 0: Like I'm not sure which part of it is licensed from Wodsy Right that they have to.

475
00:28:17,418 --> 00:28:20,790
Speaker 0: you know, it's like they've already changed the rules so much from the original netrunner.

476
00:28:21,011 --> 00:28:23,770
Speaker 0: It's not like a and we know you can't patent game rules.

477
00:28:24,012 --> 00:28:27,961
Speaker 0: Well, I think what's really interesting when I step back Oh, you can only patent game rules, but I don't forget.

478
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:28,784
Speaker 0: but at the point when

479
00:28:28,825 --> 00:28:45,174
Speaker 1: I step back a little bit There's this situation I think where non collectible card games have an obvious monetization model of both the collector's market Like the primary market the secondary market that brings value from like card investment in trading or whatever and the draft tournaments Mm-hmm.

480
00:28:45,335 --> 00:28:47,450
Speaker 1: So there's like three main play and mercy.

481
00:28:47,450 --> 00:28:56,524
Speaker 1: They tried to make drafting for netrunner and no one was in Revenue streams that were highly effective and the addictive nature of the games also feeds that cycle.

482
00:28:56,544 --> 00:29:06,113
Speaker 1: and but with a non collectible game the draft tournaments never seem to work out for obvious reasons the Monetization model for this.

483
00:29:06,133 --> 00:29:07,437
Speaker 1: there's no secondary market.

484
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:11,910
Speaker 1: So the primary market is every player buys every set once right?

485
00:29:12,030 --> 00:29:12,957
Speaker 0: It's a subscription model.

486
00:29:12,977 --> 00:29:13,219
Speaker 0: Basically.

487
00:29:13,239 --> 00:29:20,728
Speaker 0: It's like World of Warcraft you pay $15 every month or two to make sure you have all the cards and then you all everyone has all the cards.

488
00:29:21,049 --> 00:29:22,335
Speaker 0: and I think Really?

489
00:29:22,355 --> 00:29:24,888
Speaker 0: I would really like to see a digital card game.

490
00:29:24,909 --> 00:29:25,170
Speaker 0: do this.

491
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:26,254
Speaker 0: Imagine if hearthstone was.

492
00:29:26,274 --> 00:29:29,106
Speaker 0: just pay ten bucks a month and you'll have every hearthstone card.

493
00:29:29,146 --> 00:29:31,250
Speaker 0: and it's about playing the game It's not about gambling.

494
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:40,550
Speaker 1: But anyway in terms of like a non collectible game like this I feel like the only that you can't make enough money To keep a big property going and support a community effectively.

495
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:47,463
Speaker 0: You definitely make less money overall even if your player base is enormous But you make more money with a crappier game.

496
00:29:47,483 --> 00:29:54,392
Speaker 0: you make steady money And if your game is good enough you get what netrunner had which is a big community that stays Invested.

497
00:29:54,453 --> 00:29:55,478
Speaker 0: the thing is FFG.

498
00:29:55,719 --> 00:30:10,509
Speaker 0: The reason netrunner even waned at all Throughout its life is simply because FFG not producing enough cards not being active enough in the you know The competitive community managing turn being active in the competitive community probably cost more than producing the cards.

499
00:30:11,737 --> 00:30:13,230
Speaker 1: Maybe shocking how it's like.

500
00:30:13,270 --> 00:30:16,670
Speaker 0: Basically, right, but it's basically like they didn't even put effort into like putting it.

501
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:27,310
Speaker 0: You know updating ban lists quickly or communicating with people or letting us know when things are happening or it's like, you know I feel like if you did had this model and you just managed it and actually had someone.

502
00:30:27,370 --> 00:30:34,080
Speaker 0: You know, there are people whose only job was netrunner and they would communicate Extremely rarely wouldn't answer questions.

503
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,083
Speaker 0: It's like this isn't the biggest game You know, we got magic and you got Pokemon are bigger.

504
00:30:39,103 --> 00:30:40,590
Speaker 0: At least you get was probably bigger, right?

505
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:44,870
Speaker 0: It's like you should be really really active in working with your you know players.

506
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:56,758
Speaker 1: I would suspect if this my if this business model can actually work in the long run Tying it to it to a mass-market IP as opposed to a core market IP is felt like Game of Thrones Is probably a much better.

507
00:30:56,959 --> 00:30:58,205
Speaker 0: I have a Game of Thrones card game.

508
00:30:58,245 --> 00:30:58,707
Speaker 0: It never did.

509
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:03,925
Speaker 0: as well as netrunner I know and I wonder why it's not as good as a game.

510
00:31:04,185 --> 00:31:07,697
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time Certain mass-market IP.

511
00:31:07,998 --> 00:31:10,609
Speaker 1: you don't need to make that good of a game to make money with it.

512
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,050
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm sure I'm sure they make money on the Game of Thrones game.

513
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,438
Speaker 0: It used it before netrunner came.

514
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:16,489
Speaker 0: that was their biggest card game.

515
00:31:16,851 --> 00:31:20,730
Speaker 0: The fantasy flight makes most of their money on x-wing because this is the biggest profit margins.

516
00:31:21,011 --> 00:31:23,303
Speaker 0: but I sell a piece of plastic for like 30 bucks or so.

517
00:31:23,323 --> 00:31:24,409
Speaker 1: get the eSports model.

518
00:31:24,429 --> 00:31:42,593
Speaker 1: a game like this the community Tournament structure and the semi professional and the professional and the competitive community has to be supported But also has to itself be a primary driver of revenue or there just won't be enough money to justify all the effort to do Something like this.

519
00:31:42,854 --> 00:31:53,630
Speaker 0: I'm telling you make a digital digital card game where you pay a subscription fee And you have all the cards and then you have tournaments online with entry fees and real prizes and then every prizes.

520
00:31:53,690 --> 00:31:54,795
Speaker 1: So what you do?

521
00:31:54,835 --> 00:31:55,217
Speaker 1: every?

522
00:31:55,237 --> 00:31:58,290
Speaker 0: you go to city just like Mario Tennis has those tournaments, right?

523
00:31:58,390 --> 00:31:59,947
Speaker 0: You sit down you say I want to play a tournament.

524
00:32:00,028 --> 00:32:04,650
Speaker 0: Boom You pay the entry fee you're in you play then you get a prize at place that rules like in this tournament.

525
00:32:04,791 --> 00:32:06,769
Speaker 1: These are the rules for decks in this season.

526
00:32:06,890 --> 00:32:07,855
Speaker 1: These are the rules for decks.

527
00:32:08,116 --> 00:32:11,210
Speaker 0: if you could change the rules every goddamn day the restricted list changes.

528
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:14,170
Speaker 0: You don't have to worry about cheating, you know, there's so many things that are solved.

529
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:17,018
Speaker 0: You know made a miracle by having a digital card game.

530
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:20,930
Speaker 0: You never made digital netrunner because the community did it, right?

531
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:22,429
Speaker 0: It's like the community did a real shitty job.

532
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:24,037
Speaker 0: I refused to play because it was so shitty.

533
00:32:24,419 --> 00:32:28,370
Speaker 0: even the second version that came out with which is jinteki.net So shitty I refused to do it.

534
00:32:28,410 --> 00:32:35,426
Speaker 1: I think the other thing that really hurts games like this is that if they're physical The vast majority of players will not have other players in their area.

535
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:36,009
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

536
00:32:36,029 --> 00:32:39,086
Speaker 1: digital Yeah, but that's a very different game.

537
00:32:39,127 --> 00:32:40,675
Speaker 1: at that point It's a very different business model.

538
00:32:40,696 --> 00:32:43,449
Speaker 1: It's a very different company that has to be involved you both at the same time.

539
00:32:44,572 --> 00:32:47,285
Speaker 1: I wouldn't bother with a physical to be honest digital only.

540
00:32:47,306 --> 00:32:55,041
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I mean it depends, you know, sometimes, you know the in the digital game you can do stuff You can't do in the physical game right exactly like Hearthstone does.

541
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:57,710
Speaker 1: but then the in-person tournaments are tablet-based.

542
00:32:58,512 --> 00:32:59,324
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean this one.

543
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:09,370
Speaker 1: Yeah but anyway things of the day.

544
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:17,976
Speaker 1: I love nonsense like this, but this is just Wall because Waluigi's been in the news lately because he's not in smash which I think is a girl.

545
00:33:18,236 --> 00:33:19,621
Speaker 0: that is that is What is that?

546
00:33:19,641 --> 00:33:20,704
Speaker 0: He's an assist trophy?

547
00:33:21,065 --> 00:33:22,951
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm not feeling that.

548
00:33:23,332 --> 00:33:24,054
Speaker 1: I want Waluigi.

549
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:28,345
Speaker 1: I want like a Waluigi Protagonist main character.

550
00:33:28,365 --> 00:33:29,910
Speaker 0: You can already be Kid Koopa.

551
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,974
Speaker 0: You're your boy.

552
00:33:31,195 --> 00:33:32,540
Speaker 0: Why do you want to be anyone else?

553
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:36,031
Speaker 1: Cuz I really like Waluigi as a character.

554
00:33:36,051 --> 00:33:36,613
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

555
00:33:36,974 --> 00:33:37,415
Speaker 1: I don't know.

556
00:33:37,435 --> 00:33:38,820
Speaker 1: There's something about Waluigi.

557
00:33:39,361 --> 00:33:42,149
Speaker 0: Anyway, this I play Luigi in Mario Tennis.

558
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:46,580
Speaker 1: then this is the waka Pella chorus singing for the longest Waluigi time.

559
00:33:46,983 --> 00:33:47,809
Speaker 0: I don't think they're that good.

560
00:33:47,829 --> 00:33:48,535
Speaker 1: I think it's okay.

561
00:33:48,615 --> 00:33:49,240
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty good.

562
00:33:49,280 --> 00:34:00,600
Speaker 1: it does as the it has the appropriate amount of true Waluigi because To be fair a little bit of Waluigi goes a long way and distilled Waluigi is actually toxic to humans.

563
00:34:00,741 --> 00:34:05,260
Speaker 0: That's what if you had the actual voice actor of Waluigi, which is the same guy who does the Mario voice?

564
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:05,926
Speaker 0: What's his name?

565
00:34:06,148 --> 00:34:06,796
Speaker 1: I don't actually know.

566
00:34:07,881 --> 00:34:09,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, it does like.

567
00:34:09,127 --> 00:34:11,739
Speaker 0: if you had the actual Waluigi voice doing this then it would work.

568
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,467
Speaker 0: But it's like because you can.

569
00:34:13,588 --> 00:34:16,139
Speaker 0: it's not a good enough Waluigi impersonation.

570
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,063
Speaker 0: It falls flat for me.

571
00:34:17,344 --> 00:34:18,085
Speaker 0: It's pretty good though.

572
00:34:18,106 --> 00:34:22,359
Speaker 0: It ends up sounding like other people, you know, cuz it strays too far.

573
00:34:23,621 --> 00:34:24,385
Speaker 0: So you gotta think of the day?

574
00:34:24,505 --> 00:34:25,248
Speaker 0: I do so.

575
00:34:26,032 --> 00:34:37,000
Speaker 0: here's this awesome dude who plays guitar You know, he likes to play metal songs and he's got a guitar pedal which you know There's like 10 bajillion guitar pedals in the world that are all funky and weird ways and people mostly just use normal ones.

576
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:42,190
Speaker 0: Yeah But anyway, this guitar pedal is one of the coolest I have seen.

577
00:34:42,652 --> 00:34:45,480
Speaker 0: what it does is it turns your guitar into?

578
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,553
Speaker 0: Hatsune Miku, it's pretty crazy.

579
00:34:48,572 --> 00:34:53,780
Speaker 0: It is pretty good You just you play guitar, but what hatsune Miku singing comes out and you don't hear any guitar.

580
00:34:54,521 --> 00:35:00,246
Speaker 0: That's I don't even know how the hell they did that because you get to control not only the notes But also the word she's saying.

581
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:02,012
Speaker 0: I'm sure the video explains it.

582
00:35:02,072 --> 00:35:04,260
Speaker 0: I only watch enough of the video to see it working.

583
00:35:04,361 --> 00:35:06,096
Speaker 0: I didn't watch the whole video because it's too long.

584
00:35:06,257 --> 00:35:09,900
Speaker 1: Yep So in the minute moment the book club book is Emily Wilson translation of the Odyssey by Homa.

Speaker 0: With all I know no one wants to go to Philadelphia, but this is the one time it's okay.

596
00:35:35,121 --> 00:35:37,748
Speaker 1: Also, it's pretty cheap to go to PAX unplugged.

597
00:35:38,149 --> 00:35:39,974
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and it's all full packs.

598
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:40,977
Speaker 1: Like there's a main theater.

599
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:41,920
Speaker 1: There's panel rooms.

600
00:35:42,362 --> 00:35:45,895
Speaker 1: It's just all tabletop, which that's all I really want out of packs.

601
00:35:45,976 --> 00:35:48,782
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah, I Do like playing.

602
00:35:48,822 --> 00:35:54,839
Speaker 1: I sometimes like going into like the PC area and playing a little bit of Counter-Strike, but mostly on tabletop at PAX's.

603
00:35:55,970 --> 00:35:58,127
Speaker 1: so Cockroach poker.

604
00:35:58,409 --> 00:36:07,520
Speaker 0: so at speaking of packs We were at PAX East and I was working in tabletop walking around looking at what games Looking around and I saw some people playing this game and the game looked mad fun.

605
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:08,710
Speaker 0: And I said what the hell game is that?

606
00:36:08,730 --> 00:36:09,920
Speaker 0: and they said it's cockroach poker.

607
00:36:10,102 --> 00:36:11,277
Speaker 0: They explained it to me a little bit.

608
00:36:11,922 --> 00:36:20,484
Speaker 0: So then the next day we're hanging out playing some games and I'm like I can go to library and see if they got cockroach poker cock poker And see if it's there.

609
00:36:20,585 --> 00:36:21,709
Speaker 0: and it was not there.

610
00:36:22,251 --> 00:36:24,720
Speaker 0: So the other day I was reminded of it.

611
00:36:24,961 --> 00:36:33,479
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah that game so went on Amazon and I searched for cockroach poker, you know The South American jungle website and I saw two different ones.

612
00:36:33,841 --> 00:36:40,520
Speaker 0: So I said, oh no, should I get the original one or this upgraded looking lock-in locker or cocker lock-in poker?

613
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:42,086
Speaker 0: Royale, right.

614
00:36:42,126 --> 00:36:51,100
Speaker 0: so I go on board game geek and people are commenting like yeah There's actually a reason to own both of these and you know, there's don't just buy, you know, buying two is not redundant.

615
00:36:51,441 --> 00:36:57,360
Speaker 0: It's not one of those situations like yeah you buy carcass own and then you buy carcass own with an expansion, right?

616
00:36:57,500 --> 00:36:59,767
Speaker 0: It's like no, it's actually is different right?

617
00:36:59,828 --> 00:37:03,500
Speaker 0: So I said well, they're cheap and tiny perfect for kind of game for me.

618
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:04,823
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll buy both.

619
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:07,370
Speaker 0: So I bought both and yesterday we played both.

620
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:08,112
Speaker 1: They're pretty good.

621
00:37:08,152 --> 00:37:09,737
Speaker 1: So designed by actually designer.

622
00:37:09,777 --> 00:37:18,451
Speaker 1: I'd never heard of Jacques Zimette from Luxembourg Other games, but I don't think I've played any of them.

623
00:37:18,471 --> 00:37:23,722
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Bambaleo bad bunnies Defecent seven.

624
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:23,863
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

625
00:37:24,606 --> 00:37:26,393
Speaker 1: I've played any of these so you check them out.

626
00:37:26,433 --> 00:37:28,160
Speaker 0: But anyway, so here's the deal.

627
00:37:28,220 --> 00:37:32,045
Speaker 1: These are this one has the best name Ella fantastico So cockroach elephant.

628
00:37:32,105 --> 00:37:37,320
Speaker 0: so cockroach poker has a lot to do with cockroaches not a lot to do with poker It's a bluffing game.

629
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,840
Speaker 0: So basically way works is you put a card out there, right and you don't tell anyone what the hell it is.

630
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,326
Speaker 0: You deal out the whole deck, you know.

631
00:37:44,406 --> 00:37:49,909
Speaker 0: any first player puts a card out there and you aim the card at a specific Opponent, so maybe I aim it at rim.

632
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:52,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's phased down and I say rim.

633
00:37:52,682 --> 00:37:54,851
Speaker 0: This card is a cockroach.

634
00:37:55,012 --> 00:37:56,278
Speaker 1: So I have two choices.

635
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:59,087
Speaker 0: right now There's eight different freaking animals in the deck.

636
00:37:59,107 --> 00:38:02,297
Speaker 1: this cockroach rat, you know, so I have a choice now.

637
00:38:02,418 --> 00:38:06,079
Speaker 1: I can either Accept the card or refuse the card.

638
00:38:06,722 --> 00:38:14,840
Speaker 1: But then before once I decide that I have to say if I agree with what Scott said It is or I disagree, right?

639
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:19,715
Speaker 0: So basically your choices are pass the card along and try to it's like.

640
00:38:19,835 --> 00:38:21,380
Speaker 0: I don't know if you're bluffing or not.

641
00:38:21,461 --> 00:38:26,000
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try instead in To bluff someone else, right?

642
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:32,460
Speaker 0: So if you bluff someone else you look at the card now You know what it is and then you try to give it to someone else and you do the same thing again.

643
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:45,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you think you know, like I know Scott's lying or I know Scott's not lying It doesn't matter which it is is if you are certain Or relatively certain that you know what the other person is as lied or not.

644
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:53,476
Speaker 0: If you know what that card is without looking at it you call them out and if you are correct They take the card and if you're wrong you take the car.

645
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:58,717
Speaker 1: I might say Scott I accept this card and I believe I agree that it is a stink bug and I flip it over.

646
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:05,464
Speaker 1: if it is a stink Bug Scott has to take it back and it goes in front of him and if rim thought so in that case rim thought I was not lying.

647
00:39:05,524 --> 00:39:07,874
Speaker 0: He thought I you know was telling the truth and you were.

648
00:39:08,055 --> 00:39:09,100
Speaker 0: if I was so yeah.

649
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:11,979
Speaker 0: And then if I was lying though, he would have to take the card.

650
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:22,020
Speaker 0: Yep and basically the best part about this game is you just keep doing this over and over until One person has four bugs of the or four creatures of the same type in front of them

651
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:23,847
Speaker 1: or one player runs out of cards in their

652
00:39:23,927 --> 00:39:30,999
Speaker 0: or someone runs out of cards and the way you run into cards is because if You take a card in front of you you start the next turn.

653
00:39:31,522 --> 00:39:35,438
Speaker 0: So if you just keep bluffing wrong or getting burned even if you're.

654
00:39:35,679 --> 00:39:38,659
Speaker 0: you know All your creatures don't match up into a set of four.

655
00:39:39,221 --> 00:39:45,822
Speaker 0: You are playing more cards from your hand than other people and you because you're getting you're on the wrong end of the bluff too Much.

656
00:39:46,307 --> 00:39:47,156
Speaker 0: you're getting figured out.

657
00:39:48,205 --> 00:39:50,200
Speaker 0: So that's that's just regular cock poker.

658
00:39:50,561 --> 00:39:58,690
Speaker 0: The interesting parts of the game is that you start off and you don't really have much to go on except for reading people Psychologically and you see your hand of cards.

659
00:39:59,012 --> 00:40:00,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, I see seven stink bugs.

660
00:40:00,979 --> 00:40:05,371
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just eight of eight different creatures for six.

661
00:40:05,412 --> 00:40:07,057
Speaker 0: I think it's a 64 card deck, right?

662
00:40:07,399 --> 00:40:07,720
Speaker 1: I think so.

663
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,724
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's nothing special.

664
00:40:08,764 --> 00:40:11,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just like eight different creatures and there's eight of each.

665
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:12,400
Speaker 0: and that's it.

666
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:15,899
Speaker 0: So you can count everything but as the game goes on there's more and more face up.

667
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:22,299
Speaker 0: So like you see seven bats and so and you got three bats in front of you and someone pushes a card at you and says It's a bat.

668
00:40:24,164 --> 00:40:25,336
Speaker 0: Is that the eighth bat?

669
00:40:25,639 --> 00:40:34,240
Speaker 1: yeah It's a better low But so it's a little bit of a not a card counting game because all the information you could have is visible.

670
00:40:34,461 --> 00:40:40,289
Speaker 1: Yep, either in your hand or laying in front of people and it's a bluffing game But it's not the like.

671
00:40:40,390 --> 00:40:40,773
Speaker 1: try to.

672
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:44,977
Speaker 0: it's not like Sheriff Nottingham We're like, it's more like Liar's Dice is the sheriff of not without the luck.

673
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:48,793
Speaker 1: telling The truth is safe and lying is risky in this game.

674
00:40:49,235 --> 00:40:50,400
Speaker 1: It's always risky.

675
00:40:51,161 --> 00:40:54,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're trying to get the other person to second-guess so it's one.

676
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:57,540
Speaker 0: very doesn't matter whether you're lying or telling the truth.

677
00:40:57,862 --> 00:41:00,620
Speaker 0: If you pass a card at someone it could come back to you either way.

678
00:41:02,509 --> 00:41:11,250
Speaker 0: You just need to Say a thing and push the card in such a way that they will get it wrong or take the risk on to themselves And push it on.

679
00:41:11,270 --> 00:41:11,900
Speaker 0: just push the car.

680
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:14,133
Speaker 1: So the real decision is who do you target?

681
00:41:14,414 --> 00:41:15,299
Speaker 1: because they might then?

682
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:20,140
Speaker 0: Retargeted the card might hit everybody right when there's only one person left to be targeted.

683
00:41:20,322 --> 00:41:22,399
Speaker 0: They can't retarget it because everyone knows what it is.

684
00:41:22,701 --> 00:41:25,069
Speaker 0: They have to decide bluff, you know true or not.

685
00:41:25,149 --> 00:41:28,420
Speaker 1: The best part about this game is that Scott will pass me a card.

686
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:38,415
Speaker 1: He'll be like it's a cockroach and I'll be like I do not accept this card and I look at it And it doesn't matter what it is and I'll pass it to someone else and say it's a stink bug.

687
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:45,340
Speaker 1: I Saw one card get every day got past the maximum number of times and everyone said it was something different.

688
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:45,741
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

689
00:41:46,484 --> 00:41:48,249
Speaker 1: I love that aspect of the game.

690
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,600
Speaker 0: It's like what the hell is that the final person is supposed to think about this card.

691
00:41:51,801 --> 00:41:52,544
Speaker 0: Yep, right.

692
00:41:52,564 --> 00:41:54,230
Speaker 1: It's not the most in-depth game.

693
00:41:54,271 --> 00:41:56,560
Speaker 1: It's definitely just a bluffing game.

694
00:41:56,602 --> 00:41:57,467
Speaker 0: Yeah It's not you.

695
00:41:57,568 --> 00:42:01,932
Speaker 0: if you there's no way you can Analysis paralysis or anything because it's like you don't have a lot to go on.

696
00:42:01,992 --> 00:42:04,200
Speaker 1: it's like BS or liars dice.

697
00:42:04,401 --> 00:42:05,809
Speaker 1: Like it's that liars dice.

698
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:07,560
Speaker 0: I think it's liars ice without the luck part.

699
00:42:07,789 --> 00:42:11,940
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz liars dice you literally roll the dice and could get lucky and get like a whole shit ton of ones in there.

700
00:42:12,604 --> 00:42:14,900
Speaker 0: You can't get lucky and like strategically.

701
00:42:15,742 --> 00:42:24,069
Speaker 1: The game is pretty random unless people have really obvious tells or very bad at bluffing Yep, and it ends up being a little bit of a watch.

702
00:42:24,189 --> 00:42:27,440
Speaker 0: I couldn't figure out any great hero sticks for achieving victory.

703
00:42:27,801 --> 00:42:32,316
Speaker 1: I had a shockingly effective heuristic and someone's gonna lie.

704
00:42:32,416 --> 00:42:34,282
Speaker 0: if you're just reading people though It's just really.

705
00:42:34,363 --> 00:42:44,179
Speaker 1: but it worked a hundred percent of the time until I explained it and my heuristic was I'll tell all of you It only worked if a card got passed to someone else first before it came to me.

706
00:42:45,141 --> 00:42:48,952
Speaker 1: Whenever someone looked at a card and then gave it pushed it to me.

707
00:42:49,674 --> 00:42:52,847
Speaker 1: if they looked at it for more than four seconds I assume they were lying.

708
00:42:52,867 --> 00:43:02,025
Speaker 1: and if they looked at it for less than four seconds I assume they were telling the truth and in my experience playing this game twice that was 100% reliable.

709
00:43:02,045 --> 00:43:02,867
Speaker 0: All right.

710
00:43:02,947 --> 00:43:06,457
Speaker 0: So this cockroach poker Royale, which is not the same game.

711
00:43:06,497 --> 00:43:10,570
Speaker 0: It's not an expansion I believe you mean cocker lock in poker Royale, right?

712
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,740
Speaker 0: It is a upgraded and tweaked version of the original game.

713
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:20,807
Speaker 0: So it's mostly the same except they got rid of a few bugs which caught but gave me a problem because Scott lied and said this I spider.

714
00:43:20,887 --> 00:43:22,071
Speaker 0: I passed a card to someone.

715
00:43:22,111 --> 00:43:25,080
Speaker 0: I said spider and spider was not in the royal version.

716
00:43:25,241 --> 00:43:26,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was like oops.

717
00:43:27,842 --> 00:43:29,308
Speaker 0: But basically they cut out some animals.

718
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:32,020
Speaker 0: they put in a crown version.

719
00:43:32,281 --> 00:43:38,940
Speaker 0: So there's one rat King one cockroach King one, you know, it's that one scorpion Count as like the animal of the type, right?

720
00:43:39,060 --> 00:43:39,581
Speaker 0: But they also.

721
00:43:39,702 --> 00:43:45,358
Speaker 0: you can now say royal instead of saying cockroach or stink bug and that means it's an.

722
00:43:45,478 --> 00:43:49,580
Speaker 0: I'm not telling you What kind of animal it is, but I'm telling you it has a crown and it's just the same as otherwise.

723
00:43:50,062 --> 00:43:53,860
Speaker 0: But if you take if you end up taking a crown in front of you, however, it gets there.

724
00:43:54,161 --> 00:43:57,800
Speaker 0: There's a penalty pile so you actually can end up getting more cards.

725
00:43:58,081 --> 00:44:03,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you so it's like you kind of want to pass the crowns and make people take them, right?

726
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:12,180
Speaker 0: But if you take if you take a crown got a royal rat from your hand and try to pass it off You could immediately have that in front of you if you'd the other person calls you and gets it, right?

727
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:19,391
Speaker 1: so the royale version basically adds a swingier Higher risk situation to the game.

728
00:44:19,411 --> 00:44:21,220
Speaker 0: It also has these two special cards.

729
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:26,480
Speaker 0: Yep That are basically sort of like foils that you can sort of confuse people with like this one.

730
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,267
Speaker 0: That's always false no matter what you say.

731
00:44:28,287 --> 00:44:29,251
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's.

732
00:44:29,392 --> 00:44:36,483
Speaker 0: and there's one that is always Is always it's always true royal Right.

733
00:44:36,504 --> 00:44:39,480
Speaker 0: So if you say royal it's always wrong, but you say anything else and it's right.

734
00:44:39,641 --> 00:44:46,459
Speaker 1: But the mechanics with these cards are if you get caught with it Like if you're if you take it and you're wrong about it you take it into your hand.

735
00:44:46,841 --> 00:44:50,535
Speaker 1: You got to play the thing you were wrong about in front of you if you have it.

736
00:44:50,796 --> 00:44:53,639
Speaker 1: if you don't have it Daddy to in front of you.

737
00:44:53,867 --> 00:44:59,497
Speaker 0: Yeah So you basically there's just a whole bunch of cards that let you hurt people more but could end up hurting you more.

738
00:44:59,578 --> 00:45:05,852
Speaker 0: because like Anytime you pass a card to someone in this game It's like you just want that person to pass the card along.

739
00:45:05,912 --> 00:45:09,565
Speaker 0: You don't want them to guess because if they guess It's like they got it.

740
00:45:09,585 --> 00:45:12,540
Speaker 0: You got a 50/50 shot of that card coming right back in your face.

741
00:45:12,841 --> 00:45:18,020
Speaker 1: So the game is highly social like it's very easy to just sort of interact and hang out and play at the table.

742
00:45:18,241 --> 00:45:19,004
Speaker 0: It's easy to learn.

743
00:45:19,024 --> 00:45:19,787
Speaker 0: It doesn't take long.

744
00:45:19,988 --> 00:45:22,880
Speaker 0: Yep, you can play with two to six people, but I wouldn't recommend two.

745
00:45:22,980 --> 00:45:25,390
Speaker 0: I think three to three to six is where it's quick to play.

746
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:28,040
Speaker 1: the game goes on for a little while because there's like.

747
00:45:28,281 --> 00:45:31,020
Speaker 0: I think it went on for a little while because you had four players.

748
00:45:31,421 --> 00:45:32,887
Speaker 0: So there's more cards in your hand.

749
00:45:32,907 --> 00:45:35,658
Speaker 0: I think if you had six players, it might go.

750
00:45:35,678 --> 00:45:36,946
Speaker 0: well It might go.

751
00:45:37,107 --> 00:45:43,742
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if we go longer or shorter Because on the one hand to be harder for somebody to get four of the one thing in front of them when they spread out More.

752
00:45:44,044 --> 00:45:46,540
Speaker 0: but on the other hand someone could run out of cards in the hand real fast.

753
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:47,655
Speaker 0: So they keep getting targeted Yep.

754
00:45:47,961 --> 00:45:51,555
Speaker 0: And it's keep targeting that person who's only got a few cards in the hand.

755
00:45:51,636 --> 00:45:55,872
Speaker 1: once someone's got three rats Like everyone just starts throwing like hey, here's a rat you could actually.

756
00:45:55,912 --> 00:45:58,061
Speaker 0: so we could actually for example conspire Right.

757
00:45:58,081 --> 00:46:04,267
Speaker 0: Let's say I start the game and sitting to my you know, I got Emily and and Chris next to me and I say Hey, let's make rim lose.

758
00:46:04,508 --> 00:46:07,040
Speaker 0: So basically we could set up a thing where I always passed.

759
00:46:07,241 --> 00:46:13,720
Speaker 0: Oh, no, we couldn't because as soon as you took a card you would start Yep, but we can set up a thing to where whenever whenever possible.

760
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:18,380
Speaker 0: So basically three fourths of the time the politics of where you direct a car.

761
00:46:18,460 --> 00:46:25,471
Speaker 0: We always make rim the let we always don't accept the cards and always pass it to rim last Basically forced to agree or disagree.

762
00:46:25,531 --> 00:46:26,960
Speaker 1: you don't want to be involved.

763
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:30,319
Speaker 1: Yes, like really you just do not want cards to ever come in front of you.

764
00:46:30,781 --> 00:46:33,071
Speaker 0: It is really no benefit to actually like playing.

765
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:35,220
Speaker 0: your best bet is to sit there and do nothing.

766
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,286
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz there's only one loser.

767
00:46:37,748 --> 00:46:41,600
Speaker 0: It's not like one person wins is one loser and everyone else wins equally.

768
00:46:41,981 --> 00:46:44,511
Speaker 0: So just don't be that loser this.

769
00:46:44,531 --> 00:46:46,640
Speaker 1: so I recommend this game either either.

770
00:46:46,901 --> 00:46:49,420
Speaker 0: It is possible if you're not the first player in the game.

771
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,440
Speaker 0: It is possible for you to sit there and do nothing the entire game and then win.

772
00:46:53,401 --> 00:47:04,500
Speaker 1: I would recommend either of both of these games to anyone who goes to conventions and you need games to like get to the table While you're waiting for everyone to show up or like in between two serious games bust this out.

773
00:47:04,942 --> 00:47:08,600
Speaker 1: This is also a great game to bust out while you're eating dinner or something at a con.

774
00:47:08,821 --> 00:47:09,988
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know if you should buy.

775
00:47:10,008 --> 00:47:11,980
Speaker 0: whether you buy the royal one or the regular one.

776
00:47:12,060 --> 00:47:14,211
Speaker 0: It's like the royal one does add some complexity.

777
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:14,734
Speaker 0: role one.

778
00:47:14,774 --> 00:47:18,269
Speaker 0: in my it wasn't Necessarily more fun than the regular one.

779
00:47:18,309 --> 00:47:21,340
Speaker 0: The regular one was just sort of so polished and pure.

780
00:47:21,842 --> 00:47:23,407
Speaker 0: So I don't really see them like.

781
00:47:23,508 --> 00:47:24,451
Speaker 0: one is better than the other.

782
00:47:24,491 --> 00:47:26,880
Speaker 0: they seem kind of equal but slightly different.

783
00:47:26,900 --> 00:47:27,322
Speaker 1: I would say.

784
00:47:27,362 --> 00:47:32,180
Speaker 1: the royal one is swingier more random and there's higher risk in any given hand.

785
00:47:32,704 --> 00:47:34,438
Speaker 1: That's the only difference between the two.

786
00:47:34,962 --> 00:47:42,381
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I'm not like if you I'm sitting there and I'm about to play and I have to pick one of the two I guess like a coin toss, right and it depends in the group I think.

787
00:47:42,783 --> 00:47:45,090
Speaker 0: definitely though there is an advantage of.

788
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:49,687
Speaker 0: if you have people haven't played it before you probably mean Right.

789
00:47:49,827 --> 00:47:56,980
Speaker 0: if they're intelligent gamers you could just go straight to the royal one No problem, but the regular one is not a baby mode.

790
00:47:57,321 --> 00:48:02,236
Speaker 0: So it definitely helps to play the regular one first and then play the royal one.

791
00:48:02,356 --> 00:48:04,662
Speaker 0: It'll be a much easier Transition.

792
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:12,566
Speaker 1: I would also say though that this is an excellent game to bust out for non gamer Friends or for a family.

793
00:48:12,968 --> 00:48:15,256
Speaker 0: also great for you could probably play this.

794
00:48:15,276 --> 00:48:20,000
Speaker 0: a very young people I imagine probably like I don't know ten-year-olds could play.

795
00:48:20,261 --> 00:48:22,491
Speaker 1: I think I think six to ten-year-olds could play.

796
00:48:22,732 --> 00:48:26,007
Speaker 1: six-year-olds would play randomly and have problems But I think they could do it below.

797
00:48:26,047 --> 00:48:27,072
Speaker 1: that would still be trouble.

798
00:48:27,132 --> 00:48:30,188
Speaker 0: but young kids can play this game I'm not sure, you know, but you could.

799
00:48:30,208 --> 00:48:31,577
Speaker 0: there's definitely a very young.

800
00:48:31,638 --> 00:48:32,000
Speaker 0: I'm not sure.

801
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:33,409
Speaker 0: What does it say on the box for age?

802
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:37,811
Speaker 1: It says let's see Two to six players ages eight and up.

803
00:48:37,932 --> 00:48:39,399
Speaker 1: community says six and up.

804
00:48:39,821 --> 00:48:40,646
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you can.

805
00:48:40,806 --> 00:48:43,459
Speaker 0: you can definitely the especially the non-royal one.

806
00:48:43,801 --> 00:48:45,937
Speaker 0: You can play with young people cuz like.

807
00:48:46,983 --> 00:48:48,772
Speaker 0: You know, how are they gonna mess the game up right?

808
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:50,259
Speaker 0: You know, it's it's not hard.

809
