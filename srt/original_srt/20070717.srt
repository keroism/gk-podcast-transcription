1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,385
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday July 17th.

2
00:00:12,609 --> 00:00:13,131
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:19,060
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek night tonight beating the game.

4
00:00:24,351 --> 00:00:25,386
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,153 --> 00:00:34,930
Speaker 1: Huh, it's gaming day, and we still haven't played any more video games.

6
00:00:35,231 --> 00:00:37,259
Speaker 0: You think we're gonna have time until I don't know well.

7
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,364
Speaker 0: Maybe at the shore.

8
00:00:38,444 --> 00:00:39,790
Speaker 0: We might play some video games.

9
00:00:39,911 --> 00:00:42,149
Speaker 1: I think we might play some guitar hero type games.

10
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:51,006
Speaker 0: I think we're mostly gonna play guitar hero and possibly the old Wario ware and maybe some pac-man verse Yeah, and we'll also might gonna play DDR in the arcades.

11
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:56,660
Speaker 0: Oh, man I I gotta say I like video like console games I like PC games and all that.

12
00:00:56,721 --> 00:01:07,430
Speaker 0: but I Love good arcades, and I'm so looking forward to this week at the shore because last year arcades are good again Because they've been going steadily downhill for a long time.

13
00:01:07,611 --> 00:01:08,053
Speaker 0: I don't know.

14
00:01:08,094 --> 00:01:14,022
Speaker 0: because the one arcade it kind of shifted and last year We pretty much had the sea of the eight DDR machines.

15
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:15,950
Speaker 1: I know but it's just DDR and air hockey.

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:16,915
Speaker 1: I need my variety.

17
00:01:16,955 --> 00:01:18,944
Speaker 1: I need a good shooting game variety.

18
00:01:18,965 --> 00:01:19,990
Speaker 0: There's no new good games.

19
00:01:20,311 --> 00:01:21,095
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

20
00:01:21,155 --> 00:01:22,623
Speaker 1: I need like a racing game.

21
00:01:22,723 --> 00:01:24,130
Speaker 1: I need any a pinball.

22
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:26,057
Speaker 1: You know you got to mix it up.

23
00:01:26,217 --> 00:01:29,890
Speaker 1: the arcade of just DDR and air hockey isn't really an arcade.

24
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,350
Speaker 1: It's just like a DDR air hockey place.

25
00:01:32,450 --> 00:01:38,530
Speaker 0: I guess my expectations are just so lowered by the fact that real arcades pretty much don't exist outside of Chinatown.

26
00:01:38,951 --> 00:01:43,004
Speaker 0: Well in Japan yeah, yeah well in the u.s.. They don't exist so much anymore.

27
00:01:43,085 --> 00:01:50,969
Speaker 0: I know I mean the best arcade I know that's actually an arcade is this shady seedy looking place on Mott Street in Chinatown, but you know what?

28
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:52,662
Speaker 0: They've got Giga wing.

29
00:01:52,682 --> 00:01:58,335
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, but kinetic on we the video game room We didn't play so much in there.

30
00:01:58,375 --> 00:02:02,530
Speaker 0: know all kind of video game rooms except for katsu cons are identical pretty much.

31
00:02:03,052 --> 00:02:08,136
Speaker 1: But we did have some fun in the board game room played some goa Which is a game you might remember.

32
00:02:08,175 --> 00:02:11,650
Speaker 1: we failed to play in the past because the rule book sucks.

33
00:02:12,012 --> 00:02:13,762
Speaker 0: What I wasn't so much that the rule book.

34
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,230
Speaker 1: it was partially that the rule book.

35
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,916
Speaker 0: I think it was primarily that one.

36
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:20,449
Speaker 0: the game is a lot seems a lot more complicated than it is.

37
00:02:20,469 --> 00:02:23,737
Speaker 0: yeah Involves many disparate mechanics.

38
00:02:24,158 --> 00:02:24,960
Speaker 0: mm-hmm three.

39
00:02:25,422 --> 00:02:30,449
Speaker 0: there was a dog barking in the room for There were a bunch of people barking in the room.

40
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:32,941
Speaker 0: Five we only had an hour.

41
00:02:32,961 --> 00:02:34,290
Speaker 1: none of us knew how to play.

42
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:37,178
Speaker 0: Yes having someone actually knowing how to play.

43
00:02:37,238 --> 00:02:41,310
Speaker 0: teaching you how to play that game is probably the only way to really learn easily.

44
00:02:41,591 --> 00:02:48,129
Speaker 1: Regardless it's an awesome game and expect to hear about it in the future not the near future, but the future for sir someday.

45
00:02:48,149 --> 00:03:09,470
Speaker 1: yes So and the news this might not sound like gaming news at first, but on July 13th 14th and 15th in Union Park I think near Chicago right There was a pitchfork music festival, or I guess a music festival known as the pitchfork music festival.

46
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,958
Speaker 0: Do they make music with pitchforks?

47
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:21,385
Speaker 1: no, but it had a lot of high-profile bands such as Mastodon and the GZ a and a whole bunch of others that are listed on this website.

48
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:31,310
Speaker 1: Uh-huh De La Soul The William Parker quartet it seems like a real you know varying styles music festival something with you know something for everybody.

49
00:03:31,371 --> 00:03:32,184
Speaker 0: It's kind of thing I like.

50
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:42,490
Speaker 1: yeah I would probably would have gone if I lived anywhere near Chicago and I knew about it And I wasn't doing anything this weekend, but apparently there were some kids at this music festival.

51
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:43,673
Speaker 1: They actually don't look like kids.

52
00:03:43,693 --> 00:03:44,716
Speaker 1: They look like our age.

53
00:03:44,756 --> 00:03:45,579
Speaker 1: Maybe a little younger.

54
00:03:45,819 --> 00:03:46,762
Speaker 1: Maybe college kids.

55
00:03:46,822 --> 00:03:48,346
Speaker 1: I can't tell I were they punks?

56
00:03:49,570 --> 00:03:51,379
Speaker 0: uh No, they don't look Punk.

57
00:03:51,419 --> 00:04:06,370
Speaker 1: They look normal all right, but They pretty much walked around the entire music festival with a sign Saying let's trade Pokemon, and they were holding their DS's up in the air, and they traded a lot of Pokemon.

58
00:04:09,294 --> 00:04:11,730
Speaker 0: You know I just I got to point out while we were at Kineticon.

59
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:21,973
Speaker 0: you know every con season ever since the DS and the PSP came out we've always talked about like the ratio and Pretty much everyone had a DS, but I saw like six or seven PSPs.

60
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:26,230
Speaker 0: there was like one PSP for every 30 DS's so it wasn't that bad of a ratio.

61
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:28,437
Speaker 1: I see some PSPs on the subway.

62
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:29,842
Speaker 0: You know but thing is though.

63
00:04:29,882 --> 00:04:31,648
Speaker 0: You never see like a crowd of PSP.

64
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:32,190
Speaker 1: That's right.

65
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:36,970
Speaker 1: They're always solitary like video watchers or solitary guys on the subway.

66
00:04:37,051 --> 00:04:39,592
Speaker 1: You went to ever see the crew of PSP.

67
00:04:39,632 --> 00:04:47,739
Speaker 0: if you went anywhere at Kineticon and opened your picto chat there were just penises left and right and up and down and Behind where you don't want them to be.

68
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,438
Speaker 0: and if you said my pokemons Let me show you them.

69
00:04:50,720 --> 00:05:03,082
Speaker 1: there were like seven people Standing around you ready to talk in the underground to get a spirit oom and ready to show you them yes So I think it's pretty crazy if you know we go to an anime convention.

70
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,832
Speaker 1: of course you expect there to be pokemons all over The place.

71
00:05:05,852 --> 00:05:22,443
Speaker 1: yeah, well not just pokemons, but like geekery, and I don't really see that Outside of geek magnets, but here you go to a sort of wide appeal mainstream music show and Pokemons and lots of pokemons going on.

72
00:05:22,463 --> 00:05:25,735
Speaker 1: apparently you know I think it's good.

73
00:05:25,816 --> 00:05:33,223
Speaker 0: in the end people may say oh pokemons and Naruto's and all those things are crap And that's not the cool real stuff that I care about.

74
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:41,370
Speaker 0: but most of you well I don't say most of you But many geeks who like you know like the good anime or the good video games started out playing halo and watching Dragon Ball.

75
00:05:41,685 --> 00:05:51,130
Speaker 0: Yeah You can't say that just because someone likes something that you think is pulpy or crab or for little kids Doesn't mean that that thing can't be entertaining in and of itself and can't be a gateway drug.

76
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:58,678
Speaker 1: But you know it seems like you know we were in a world where anyone who liked anything geeky was in the minority and everyone Else didn't like anything geeky at all.

77
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:14,390
Speaker 1: and now we're moving into a world where Everyone is geeky or more and more people are geeky and then the these geeks that are even more Geeky who are secluded and split off and segregated in some way, so I don't know will it eventually?

78
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:20,088
Speaker 1: Will there always be some group that is like separate and minority from the other group?

79
00:06:20,109 --> 00:06:22,023
Speaker 0: or well There are always the nerds.

80
00:06:22,386 --> 00:06:28,470
Speaker 0: and second They're always the people who decide that they don't like something because now it's mainstream so they get more and more obscure.

81
00:06:28,652 --> 00:06:30,369
Speaker 1: Those people need to get a life.

82
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:31,735
Speaker 1: That's all I gotta say.

83
00:06:31,775 --> 00:06:32,860
Speaker 0: see the ultimate is you know like.

84
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,065
Speaker 0: there's the indie kids who are they?

85
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:38,316
Speaker 0: name-drop bands like oh well I was listening to Feebly fobbly last night.

86
00:06:38,356 --> 00:06:42,809
Speaker 0: They're a. they're a transfusion hypnotic techno remix emo something.

87
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:46,238
Speaker 0: no They always make up like no matter what sub-genre you like.

88
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,488
Speaker 0: they always add like a sub sub-genre to it like you're like.

89
00:06:49,789 --> 00:06:52,835
Speaker 0: I like new Neoprimativist music.

90
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:53,720
Speaker 0: there's a great.

91
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:55,310
Speaker 0: I like post neoprimativist music.

92
00:06:55,390 --> 00:07:01,726
Speaker 1: There's a great shirt you can get on threadless and all it is is a t-shirt that says I Listen to bands that don't even exist.

93
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:01,948
Speaker 1: yet

94
00:07:02,973 --> 00:07:15,602
Speaker 0: What I was about to say was I think at some point all those people are gonna have left to do is They'll make up something and pretend that they like it and the moment anyone else says that they also Like that thing that's made up and doesn't actually exist.

95
00:07:16,104 --> 00:07:16,365
Speaker 0: I don't know.

96
00:07:16,386 --> 00:07:17,230
Speaker 0: They'll just kill themselves.

97
00:07:17,411 --> 00:07:21,808
Speaker 0: I have no idea, but regardless Pokemans let me show you them.

98
00:07:22,572 --> 00:07:23,355
Speaker 1: So would you like this?

99
00:07:23,495 --> 00:07:26,928
Speaker 0: there's been all this news about e3 and I don't want to get into the details of.

100
00:07:27,309 --> 00:07:30,360
Speaker 0: oh E3 moved or oh, it's not Lloyd it used to be your.

101
00:07:30,521 --> 00:07:32,267
Speaker 0: Oh news happened to d3.

102
00:07:32,548 --> 00:07:34,159
Speaker 1: It's small It's insignificant.

103
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:35,370
Speaker 1: now blabbity blabbity blood.

104
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:51,129
Speaker 0: All I really want to say is I'll be perfectly honest and that as hardcore as I am into video games granted I'm not quite as hardcore as a lot of you know, modern hip hardcore gamers since I mostly like Platformers and older games and I played Nintendo games more than anything else Yep.

105
00:07:51,631 --> 00:07:58,689
Speaker 0: But I never really cared about e3 in my entire life and I only wanted to go before I actually knew what e3 was.

106
00:07:59,971 --> 00:08:03,101
Speaker 0: Uh-huh, like once I found out that e3 was pretty much just.

107
00:08:03,863 --> 00:08:05,830
Speaker 0: I don't think most people who go actually have fun.

108
00:08:06,475 --> 00:08:08,310
Speaker 0: I think they do not the same kind of fun.

109
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:10,029
Speaker 0: I can't have fun at a con like that.

110
00:08:10,452 --> 00:08:18,593
Speaker 0: most of what I like at a con is hanging out with people and Maybe putting on a show if I could do that or hanging out in my geekery and go into stuff But any three.

111
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:19,556
Speaker 0: it seems like most of it.

112
00:08:19,596 --> 00:08:25,416
Speaker 0: especially what e3 turned into was stand in lines play short demos of games Be in a room.

113
00:08:25,457 --> 00:08:26,222
Speaker 0: That's so loud.

114
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:27,430
Speaker 0: You cannot hold a conversation.

115
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:31,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, it seems like all the real fun action was all the after parties.

116
00:08:32,051 --> 00:08:41,417
Speaker 1: But the real fun action to me seemed like it was in that You know famous other hall where all the indie game type the weird games would be that You know people always talked about.

117
00:08:41,739 --> 00:08:43,308
Speaker 1: but those days are over.

118
00:08:43,428 --> 00:08:45,540
Speaker 1: So now e3.

119
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:45,929
Speaker 1: whatever.

120
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:48,376
Speaker 0: Frankly, I'm glad e3 did what they did.

121
00:08:48,436 --> 00:08:59,844
Speaker 0: because while I mean e3 originally was supposed to be like the video game event where all the News comes out and the press gets to see what's coming and they kept letting more and more people come I mean they used to claim that you had to be a journalist of some kind to go

122
00:08:59,904 --> 00:09:01,009
Speaker 1: an EB employee to get

123
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:01,130
Speaker 0: in.

124
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:02,661
Speaker 0: That was such a joke.

125
00:09:02,862 --> 00:09:03,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much forever.

126
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,866
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now it's actually you really do can't need to be someone important to get in.

127
00:09:08,906 --> 00:09:10,210
Speaker 1: you can't just get into e3 now.

128
00:09:10,631 --> 00:09:14,204
Speaker 0: I guess I'm glad now the press will just do their thing and we'll get our stuff.

129
00:09:14,244 --> 00:09:17,558
Speaker 0: and if someone wants to have the crazy Hangout gaming convention.

130
00:09:17,578 --> 00:09:25,890
Speaker 0: I don't know if the industry will care about it so much So it'll probably just end up being more like a gaming convention with people hanging out and not so much of the industry.

131
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:27,998
Speaker 0: Let me show you my pokemons.

132
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:30,247
Speaker 1: I think the one thing that's interesting about this though.

133
00:09:30,307 --> 00:09:44,990
Speaker 1: Is that unlike other media, right People in the video game media are also the fans, you know, I mean sure in the sports media Some people are also sports fans, but that's not quite the same because it's not an interactive thing, you know.

134
00:09:45,070 --> 00:09:48,990
Speaker 1: And people, you know some people in the tech media are also tech fans.

135
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:54,110
Speaker 1: But for the most part media people are not usually super fans of the things they media.

136
00:09:54,652 --> 00:10:12,470
Speaker 1: So e3 and trying to appeal to the gaming media appealed to the gaming fan And it because it's video games those interactive experience and that's why actual fans tried to get in Now by changing the show in such a way that it is not fun for the fans.

137
00:10:12,591 --> 00:10:14,078
Speaker 1: It is only good for the media.

138
00:10:14,098 --> 00:10:20,724
Speaker 1: the media that is also fans Which is most of the video game media is now also like not having fun there.

139
00:10:20,744 --> 00:10:22,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do agree with that.

140
00:10:22,871 --> 00:10:28,090
Speaker 0: I just there's no real easy way around it because if there was ever an event like that that kept going.

141
00:10:28,492 --> 00:10:30,781
Speaker 0: I mean like all the punk kids are always gonna want to go.

142
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:33,030
Speaker 1: I know look at look at Nintendo's press conference, right?

143
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:42,389
Speaker 1: They spent the the first poll part of it talking about sales numbers and things like that stuff that in any other Industry, the media would have cared a lot about.

144
00:10:42,911 --> 00:10:46,503
Speaker 1: But most of the gaming media people the blogs and the magazines are like man.

145
00:10:46,523 --> 00:10:48,430
Speaker 1: Nintendo's press conference is so boring.

146
00:10:48,651 --> 00:10:51,314
Speaker 1: All they do was talk about numbers, you know Maybe that comes in.

147
00:10:51,355 --> 00:11:03,388
Speaker 0: there was just an article on slash out about how bit by bit Blogs and all that sort of thing and you know kind of independent press are pretty much dominating tech news at this point because the real media just can't keep up at all and they don't know what's going on.

148
00:11:03,428 --> 00:11:11,070
Speaker 0: and yeah I kind of agree with that because I listen to you know NPR or the BBC or I read Google News and anything that's on the mainstream media.

149
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,442
Speaker 0: It's like a week old like I already knew about it for a week.

150
00:11:13,663 --> 00:11:15,150
Speaker 1: It's to the point where it doesn't help.

151
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:18,029
Speaker 0: it's usually wrong or it's just it's garbage.

152
00:11:18,049 --> 00:11:27,042
Speaker 0: and I feel like the gaming more and more we're having these things where people who are fans of or knowledgeable about Something are being the press for it.

153
00:11:27,102 --> 00:11:32,750
Speaker 0: So the generic normal Reporter guy who works for Reuters or the AP wire or whatever?

154
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:40,510
Speaker 0: He doesn't really have anything to add anymore unless it's a special interest local story or something that for whatever reason people don't care about.

155
00:11:40,973 --> 00:11:43,530
Speaker 0: Yep, but at least there aren't people who are fans of it.

156
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:51,509
Speaker 1: I mean he does sometimes have the job of translating these stuff so that normal idiots can understand You know what's going on and something they don't know about.

157
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:57,226
Speaker 1: In the process, they usually make things also wrong and they misinform people.

158
00:11:57,326 --> 00:11:58,430
Speaker 0: I mean really self-centered here.

159
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,930
Speaker 0: I'm just talking from the perspective of a knowledgeable person.

160
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:11,637
Speaker 0: Yeah I have almost no use for the mainstream media when it comes to anything I know about and I'm glad that the internet has made it so that the people reporting on the things I care about Care about the exact same things I care about.

161
00:12:11,657 --> 00:12:19,270
Speaker 1: that is a good thing, but at the same time I feel like There's something missing like that.

162
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,133
Speaker 1: You know shouldn't be?

163
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:28,082
Speaker 1: it's like I wish that at while also being fans of the things I care about They were also the professional in the journalism way.

164
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,005
Speaker 0: See some people are.

165
00:12:29,587 --> 00:12:33,500
Speaker 0: some of them are yes I mean outside of whenever Apple releases a new product.

166
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,968
Speaker 0: a lot of the tech people are pretty objective tech people are.

167
00:12:36,008 --> 00:12:39,502
Speaker 1: it's mostly the Video game people I'm complaining about not being real journalists.

168
00:12:40,205 --> 00:12:41,490
Speaker 0: It depends on the video game people.

169
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:55,743
Speaker 0: I mean, honestly, I'll say this straight up the only people outside of my circle of friends I look to for any guidance whatsoever in terms of what video games are good or what's going on the video game industry Penny arcade and to a lesser extent Dave and Joel.

170
00:12:55,964 --> 00:12:57,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, because we have similar taste in games.

171
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:08,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the other thing is like you read some of these gaming blogs like the Kotaku's and the Joysticks and they don't really tell you like which games are good and which ones are bad.

172
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:10,738
Speaker 1: They're just like hey these games are coming out.

173
00:13:10,798 --> 00:13:13,167
Speaker 1: Hey, these companies made these announcements.

174
00:13:13,448 --> 00:13:16,069
Speaker 1: It's like You're not really helping me out here.

175
00:13:16,931 --> 00:13:17,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean so the stuff.

176
00:13:18,058 --> 00:13:20,050
Speaker 1: I still read your stuff because I do care about that.

177
00:13:20,190 --> 00:13:21,903
Speaker 1: But there's other stuff I care about.

178
00:13:21,923 --> 00:13:23,957
Speaker 1: you're not telling me Honestly, though.

179
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,870
Speaker 0: I don't really have a strong opinion.

180
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:28,764
Speaker 0: I just needed to pick a crap news to get the show over with.

181
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:36,062
Speaker 0: cuz I agree I got a million things to do before, you know, tonight's pretty much the night We have to get everything done for the next two weeks of geek night.

182
00:13:36,102 --> 00:13:46,345
Speaker 0: I'm doing laundry while doing the show Yeah, and I'm actually like working on two other geek nights kind of while we're recording and it really sucks Yep, so, uh, I'll be honest.

183
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:51,390
Speaker 0: I was just talking I wasn't really listening what was coming out of my mouth and I really truly don't have a strong opinion.

184
00:13:51,611 --> 00:13:53,521
Speaker 0: I just I don't care that e3 changed.

185
00:13:53,642 --> 00:13:54,808
Speaker 0: I think it'll be good in the end.

186
00:13:54,909 --> 00:14:07,439
Speaker 1: and Beyond that that man Mom Things that but up.

187
00:14:07,621 --> 00:14:10,329
Speaker 0: Yeah things of the day.

188
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:21,117
Speaker 0: So Emily showed this to us last night and it reminded me Enough of the you can't live 10 Pokemon that I just had to talk about it plus, uh, it's not on the top of dig Right now so you can't.

189
00:14:21,137 --> 00:14:23,049
Speaker 1: it didn't really remind me of that.

190
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:24,977
Speaker 1: You can't find 10 Pokemon so much.

191
00:14:25,499 --> 00:14:28,270
Speaker 0: mostly was the things that guy was saying before they let him in the car.

192
00:14:28,531 --> 00:14:29,896
Speaker 1: Yeah, that did remind me.

193
00:14:29,937 --> 00:14:30,760
Speaker 0: cuz that part right there.

194
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,030
Speaker 0: He's like, I think this dog is staring at me.

195
00:14:33,492 --> 00:14:34,939
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know what he wants.

196
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,386
Speaker 1: Once the guy was in the car.

197
00:14:36,426 --> 00:14:37,150
Speaker 1: I just wanted to hit him.

198
00:14:38,514 --> 00:14:39,762
Speaker 1: I don't even know why the people let him in.

199
00:14:39,802 --> 00:14:40,890
Speaker 1: They should have just driven off.

200
00:14:40,991 --> 00:14:42,290
Speaker 1: I don't know what they were stupid.

201
00:14:42,290 --> 00:14:43,190
Speaker 1: They got what they deserve.

202
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:47,348
Speaker 0: Apparently a friend of Emily's back at NYU was working on this so she saw him working on it.

203
00:14:47,569 --> 00:14:50,630
Speaker 0: now It's done and it's online and it's uh, it's pretty funny.

204
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:55,070
Speaker 0: I got to say because I've been in a similar situation someone really needs to just make a website.

205
00:14:55,231 --> 00:15:07,529
Speaker 1: That's you know, cuz there's a lot of colleges out there with animation programs And they just need to make a website that says all college students with making animation projects when you are done put them here and then we can watch all of them in one place.

206
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:23,330
Speaker 1: and Or maybe a special category on YouTube for college Animation film projects, you know that way because those are always, you know They're always better than just some high school kids with a camera But they're not always as high quality as a movie in the theater.

207
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:29,670
Speaker 1: I saw some pretty bad ones at RIT But they usually have something clever to them that makes them worth watching.

208
00:15:29,932 --> 00:15:32,150
Speaker 1: Cuz that's what you need to stand out and get a better grade.

209
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:37,435
Speaker 0: I just think this was really funny and it reminds me of some people I've met in my life And that's all I'm gonna leave it at that.

210
00:15:38,097 --> 00:15:41,690
Speaker 1: Oh, it does remind me of a few people that I don't talk to anymore.

211
00:15:41,931 --> 00:15:46,650
Speaker 0: The guy's speech pattern reminds me a little bit of Dave from Dave and Joel's fast karate for the gentleman.

212
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:50,023
Speaker 0: The thing is I don't think Dave is even a thousandth that annoying.

213
00:15:50,646 --> 00:15:51,710
Speaker 1: No, I don't think so either.

214
00:15:52,911 --> 00:15:57,774
Speaker 1: So my thing is that I am watching right now But I turn the audio off To cuz.

215
00:15:57,794 --> 00:15:58,618
Speaker 1: I know Rimmel yell at me.

216
00:15:58,658 --> 00:16:03,861
Speaker 1: if I try to like play it out of my laptop speaker and into the microphone I will but I'll probably keep it in the show.

217
00:16:03,882 --> 00:16:05,450
Speaker 0: cuz I'm too lazy to edit but I'd probably go.

218
00:16:05,852 --> 00:16:07,700
Speaker 0: Ah, now I got to edit that out and then.

219
00:16:08,242 --> 00:16:09,086
Speaker 0: but anyway, go ahead.

220
00:16:09,146 --> 00:16:09,890
Speaker 1: It's not loud enough.

221
00:16:09,971 --> 00:16:11,166
Speaker 1: Anyway, I just played it for a second.

222
00:16:11,186 --> 00:16:17,932
Speaker 1: But anyway there's a Snoop Dogg is a hip-hop and rap guy who I don't really I mean I know.

223
00:16:17,973 --> 00:16:24,530
Speaker 1: so I know of him which says a lot and I know Some stuff about him but only like the barest information.

224
00:16:25,330 --> 00:16:28,099
Speaker 1: Apparently he has this song that called drop.

225
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:29,022
Speaker 1: it like it's hot cuz.

226
00:16:29,082 --> 00:16:30,627
Speaker 1: I don't understand any other words cuz.

227
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:32,574
Speaker 1: I didn't really pay attention To what they were so much.

228
00:16:32,674 --> 00:16:36,509
Speaker 1: I could probably figure them out and the song is like drop it like it's high.

229
00:16:39,417 --> 00:16:41,490
Speaker 0: Drop it like it's hot Like it's hot something something something.

230
00:16:42,813 --> 00:16:54,730
Speaker 1: apparently Somebody realized that this song is basically the same as the song in Kirby, you know Dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, dude, man.

231
00:16:54,770 --> 00:16:55,936
Speaker 0: We're not nearly as good as that.

232
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:57,123
Speaker 0: No, Dave and Joel are

233
00:16:57,404 --> 00:17:10,362
Speaker 1: no, but Joel but the Some guy made a YTM ND and also a YouTube where he basically took up and a repeating animation of Kirby Dancing after beating wispy woods and

234
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:12,530
Speaker 0: I don't think you need to explain how you make a YTM

235
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:16,987
Speaker 1: And a repeating animation of Snoop Dogg dancing back and forth and he put

236
00:17:17,288 --> 00:17:17,589
Speaker 0: Snoop

237
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:27,952
Speaker 1: Dogg's Rapping without any background music combined with Kirby's background music and it matches eerily exactly,

238
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:35,915
Speaker 0: I got to admit I actually like the end result more than either of the original songs and I Kinda need an mp3 of that.

239
00:17:35,935 --> 00:17:36,918
Speaker 0: You just listen to.

240
00:17:37,199 --> 00:17:39,266
Speaker 1: yeah, it's a good song man.

241
00:17:39,527 --> 00:17:40,310
Speaker 1: You should check it out.

242
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:45,930
Speaker 0: No We were talking about it and I know actually last night showed us another Thing that's similar to that with the Phoenix Wright song.

243
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:46,813
Speaker 0: We realized something.

244
00:17:47,395 --> 00:17:48,559
Speaker 0: hip-hop in particular.

245
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:51,229
Speaker 0: the chord structures tend to be repetitive and simple.

246
00:17:52,393 --> 00:17:58,913
Speaker 0: I can think of one other kind of music that is generally chord wise repetitive and simple and that is Video game music.

247
00:17:59,434 --> 00:18:03,686
Speaker 0: the odds are there are a lot of hip-hop songs that coincide with video game music.

248
00:18:03,987 --> 00:18:04,388
Speaker 1: There are.

249
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:05,230
Speaker 1: what was the example?

250
00:18:05,311 --> 00:18:08,230
Speaker 0: We saw it was well, there was the Phoenix right thing.

251
00:18:08,230 --> 00:18:14,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like Phoenix right plus some other rap guy, but they sort of had to slow down the Phoenix Right music and whatever.

252
00:18:14,595 --> 00:18:17,630
Speaker 1: but this is just exact out of the box.

253
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:22,206
Speaker 1: It's almost as if Snoop was rapping to Kirby which he might have been for all we know.

254
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:23,370
Speaker 1: The odds are not zero.

255
00:18:24,012 --> 00:18:25,637
Speaker 1: But yeah, it.

256
00:18:25,698 --> 00:18:29,470
Speaker 1: this is scarily accurate and I'm sure there are many others that are close.

257
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,060
Speaker 1: But this is damn.

258
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:31,985
Speaker 1: you got to hear this shit.

259
00:18:32,388 --> 00:18:32,710
Speaker 1: Damn.

260
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:43,909
Speaker 0: Now what we need to do is find some guy who's good at rapping You know Maybe a nerdcore guy and get him to do the hip-hop thing where you just have Beats from video games and just rap straight up over that.

261
00:18:44,715 --> 00:18:46,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, because they do have the chiptune action.

262
00:18:46,811 --> 00:18:55,770
Speaker 1: Yeah, and we do have the nerdcore action But the nerdcore action is usually nerdy lyrics like about Boba Fett or something on top of normal hip-hop music.

263
00:18:56,213 --> 00:19:02,049
Speaker 1: someone's got to do a Nerdcore hip-hop on top of just video chiptunes.

264
00:19:02,471 --> 00:19:06,388
Speaker 1: You got to got to get emerging going on and that would be super us.

265
00:19:07,633 --> 00:19:17,250
Speaker 0: So we of course it's the week between the con and the con So we didn't really have anything planned and I kind of expected to skip this week entirely.

266
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,619
Speaker 0: But we're plugging through and doing shows anyway for some reason.

267
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:20,101
Speaker 1: Yeah.

268
00:19:20,241 --> 00:19:22,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, we also still have to record some.

269
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:26,010
Speaker 1: well No, we've got to make some crap shows to fill in next week when we're not here.

270
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:28,445
Speaker 0: Yeah, I pretty much have to do all of that tonight.

271
00:19:28,747 --> 00:19:29,149
Speaker 1: That's fine.

272
00:19:29,912 --> 00:19:34,830
Speaker 1: So today we tried to think up something to talk about, you know, cuz you haven't been playing video games lately.

273
00:19:34,971 --> 00:19:38,089
Speaker 1: So we didn't want to talk about the board games quite yet.

274
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,507
Speaker 1: So we we found a topic in video games to discuss.

275
00:19:41,849 --> 00:19:45,589
Speaker 0: see I remember when I was a kid that this mattered a lot more to me than it does now.

276
00:19:45,871 --> 00:19:47,460
Speaker 1: I think that's the point of this discussion.

277
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we might have talked about this before.

278
00:19:49,652 --> 00:19:53,090
Speaker 0: I don't think we did even if we did it was only as part of another episode or something.

279
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:53,774
Speaker 0: So I don't really care.

280
00:19:53,814 --> 00:19:56,410
Speaker 0: I can say it all again and I think I have enough relevant anecdotes.

281
00:19:56,851 --> 00:20:02,270
Speaker 0: Yep, but beating the game was such a big deal to me when I was a kid.

282
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:11,888
Speaker 0: Like I remember if I beat a game I would call my friends like immediately no matter what hour it was be like Dude, you got to get over here about to see the end of guerrilla war and they'd all come running.

283
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:23,068
Speaker 1: Yep Well originally when I was playing video games, you know, it was just score and even playing Mario 1 I felt like the game would go on forever like an end wasn't even something in my mind.

284
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,810
Speaker 1: Like it didn't even conceive that there would be an end to the games.

285
00:20:26,930 --> 00:20:28,722
Speaker 1: I figured they just kind of went on and on.

286
00:20:28,782 --> 00:20:33,862
Speaker 1: and you know is I Gotta keep going get far get farther and see more stuff.

287
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:41,275
Speaker 1: and a lot of the appeal of video games Especially as soon as we got to the NES games was you know, oh my god I got to a new level.

288
00:20:41,576 --> 00:20:46,095
Speaker 1: I get to see some new stuff because playing Atari games You see the same thing over and over again.

289
00:20:46,135 --> 00:20:50,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Atari games monsters didn't even change color as you went on.

290
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:52,733
Speaker 0: Yeah in berserk They did a little.

291
00:20:53,175 --> 00:20:59,567
Speaker 1: so a lot of the fun for me as a kid playing video games was When I went to a new level there'd be a new bad guy like a hammer brother.

292
00:20:59,627 --> 00:21:01,614
Speaker 1: Holy shit Oh my god a blooper.

293
00:21:01,654 --> 00:21:03,320
Speaker 1: Holy shit flying fish.

294
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,002
Speaker 1: Holy shit.

295
00:21:04,383 --> 00:21:06,670
Speaker 0: I almost peed myself the first time I saw hammer brother.

296
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:07,733
Speaker 0: That was not cool.

297
00:21:08,115 --> 00:21:10,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, you play Zelda and he'd like oh man.

298
00:21:10,342 --> 00:21:11,285
Speaker 1: There's the horsey guys.

299
00:21:11,325 --> 00:21:11,846
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

300
00:21:11,967 --> 00:21:12,950
Speaker 1: or the graveyard.

301
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:14,690
Speaker 0: Whoa, I really different.

302
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:20,450
Speaker 0: I remember getting to that graveyard like the first time and I walk in there and suddenly the screens all gray and there's that ghost.

303
00:21:20,832 --> 00:21:31,530
Speaker 0: And then I bumped into a tombstone and a ghost came out and after a kid I mean, it wasn't like really scared But I felt like I was in this eerie like Twilight world and I I felt on edge.

304
00:21:31,894 --> 00:21:32,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't get that anymore.

305
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:33,632
Speaker 0: So

306
00:21:33,712 --> 00:21:49,350
Speaker 1: when I discovered that video games actually had ends to them, you know, and I got to those ends It was pretty much like the same sensation is getting to a new level where you saw all this new stuff But multiplied by a zillion because it was like holy shit.

307
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:54,870
Speaker 1: It's the ending stuff stuff that you can never possibly see without going through insane amounts of effort.

308
00:21:55,132 --> 00:21:56,563
Speaker 1: This is you can only see it once.

309
00:21:56,623 --> 00:21:57,450
Speaker 0: this is back before.

310
00:21:57,651 --> 00:22:00,440
Speaker 0: FMV is pretty much any good Nintendo game like we're talking.

311
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:06,009
Speaker 0: any s-days had like a little opening animation Which was usually really really piss-poor.

312
00:22:06,431 --> 00:22:13,134
Speaker 0: But you're always amazed by it because while it was really bad compared to anything else you'd seen for a Nintendo game It was always awesome.

313
00:22:13,174 --> 00:22:17,490
Speaker 0: Like two ninjas are running at each other like not even shaky and then like one dies.

314
00:22:18,232 --> 00:22:19,769
Speaker 0: Yep, we all remember that game.

315
00:22:20,473 --> 00:22:37,247
Speaker 0: But if you didn't see anything like that after you started the game Until you beat the game and then you got like the final payoff and you got to see some other thing as time went on I remember as a kid I used to remember like how long the end of a game was after you beat it and I always felt like the longer it Was the better it was.

316
00:22:37,892 --> 00:22:44,696
Speaker 1: Yep, like Final Fantasy 4 because it was more stuff you haven't seen before that you were able to see, you know It's just one screen.

317
00:22:44,757 --> 00:22:56,550
Speaker 1: It's like oh I saw one screen of stuff, you know It's all about seeing new stuff and it wasn't just seeing new stuff But it was the fact that there was no way to see this stuff without expending a great deal of effort again.

318
00:22:57,092 --> 00:22:58,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, like if you wanted to see mr.

319
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:02,837
Speaker 0: Miyagi wink at the end of the karate kid You basically had to kill yourself in front of that game.

320
00:23:03,078 --> 00:23:04,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, and to do it again.

321
00:23:04,703 --> 00:23:06,730
Speaker 1: You had to spend a whole bunch more hours.

322
00:23:06,851 --> 00:23:13,530
Speaker 1: That's why when you beat a game you called your friends Yeah, I mean some kids were really smart and they would like VCR the end of the games.

323
00:23:13,590 --> 00:23:16,490
Speaker 1: They'd get him on tape, but that was very rare.

324
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:20,133
Speaker 1: And you know, there was no YouTube to just go watch whatever game ending you wanted It was.

325
00:23:20,153 --> 00:23:21,989
Speaker 1: it was totally different in those days.

326
00:23:22,252 --> 00:23:33,890
Speaker 0: I remember the most proof because a lot of times, you know If the friend couldn't come over or like say I beat a game really late at night I can't call my friend Joe and tell him to walk down the streets of Detroit to come to my house at 11 o'clock On a school night when we're in second grade.

327
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:43,995
Speaker 0: Yeah, so every Nintendo game like you'd beat it and well every good Nintendo game they'd be like the end stuff and then it would finally scroll up to like the the end and always be like the end.

328
00:23:44,076 --> 00:23:54,040
Speaker 0: or you've won or congratulations or game over and you'd always Sit there Waiting to see if anything else came.

329
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,350
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, because you're so afraid of missing something.

330
00:23:56,350 --> 00:23:56,654
Speaker 0: You're

331
00:23:56,694 --> 00:24:14,448
Speaker 1: so afraid of missing something So I would sit there watching that screen for a good many minutes and like I jam all the buttons on the gamepad to make But also I wouldn't touch the buttons no case they accidentally made something get skipped and I wouldn't ever turn it off the power unless I was absolutely sure there was nothing left to see.

332
00:24:14,468 --> 00:24:17,353
Speaker 1: because imagine like You know You're all your whole.

333
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:28,428
Speaker 1: you spent hours and your only goal and your only reward was the ability to see this footage this pixelated pictures and animations and hear this music that you could not hear any other way.

334
00:24:28,449 --> 00:24:33,495
Speaker 1: and If you missed any amount of that you had to do all of that again I remember.

335
00:24:33,575 --> 00:24:41,441
Speaker 1: and if it was if there was any randomness or luck Involved or if it took a long amount of time or if there was no save game That was a nightmare.

336
00:24:41,461 --> 00:24:42,569
Speaker 1: You might never do it again.

337
00:24:43,134 --> 00:24:52,716
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid and I'm not kidding I would sit there when I beat a game and I've watched the end especially like Final Fantasy or 4 or 6. that is gigantic And maybe you could save those.

338
00:24:53,238 --> 00:24:56,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, but still the end itself was still like this big deal.

339
00:24:56,512 --> 00:24:57,449
Speaker 1: It was it was a big deal.

340
00:24:57,892 --> 00:25:01,270
Speaker 0: You know, I get a little mad every time I had to blink just a tiny bit.

341
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:07,050
Speaker 0: I'd be like, I know I didn't miss something but I could have the game could have tried to show me something just then.

342
00:25:07,436 --> 00:25:12,026
Speaker 0: Yeah, of course I was a weird little kid but more to the point our parents must have all thought we were crazy.

343
00:25:12,066 --> 00:25:15,560
Speaker 0: cuz you know Oh kid, there's always the thing of mom.

344
00:25:15,580 --> 00:25:16,604
Speaker 0: I can't go to the doctor.

345
00:25:16,644 --> 00:25:20,240
Speaker 0: I gotta get to a save point Exactly the end of the game.

346
00:25:20,341 --> 00:25:22,090
Speaker 1: Oh, and we'll understand that when we have kids.

347
00:25:22,210 --> 00:25:25,985
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the end of the game was like that, but it was beyond like.

348
00:25:26,025 --> 00:25:26,407
Speaker 0: it wasn't.

349
00:25:26,467 --> 00:25:29,002
Speaker 0: it was sacred It was like the Holy Land.

350
00:25:29,083 --> 00:25:34,101
Speaker 0: compared to a save point It was like once you cross the threshold you well, you know what?

351
00:25:34,141 --> 00:25:35,926
Speaker 0: It's more like an orgasm.

352
00:25:36,347 --> 00:25:39,198
Speaker 0: There's a threshold For little kids.

353
00:25:39,218 --> 00:25:43,818
Speaker 0: Yeah, once you cross it like a nerdgasm You can't go back once you hit that point.

354
00:25:43,979 --> 00:25:47,830
Speaker 0: once you hit the last hit on the last boss you have beaten the game.

355
00:25:48,372 --> 00:25:53,910
Speaker 0: There is nothing left but to watch the end and you cannot pull a kid away from the end of the game.

356
00:25:53,991 --> 00:25:54,676
Speaker 1: No, you can't.

357
00:25:54,918 --> 00:26:00,450
Speaker 0: I once at Cedar Point Which was like Mecca for me as a kid because I was also super into roller coasters.

358
00:26:00,952 --> 00:26:05,050
Speaker 0: We got there right and we're gonna go into the amusement park.

359
00:26:05,291 --> 00:26:10,630
Speaker 0: But I'm in the car plugged into the AC adapter with my game gear and I be I just must have misplanned.

360
00:26:11,014 --> 00:26:15,359
Speaker 0: I beat crystal warriors Just as we pulled into the parking lot.

361
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,890
Speaker 0: All right, and that game has like a 10-minute ending.

362
00:26:18,513 --> 00:26:21,930
Speaker 0: So I'm sitting there staring at this game gear with the music all the way up.

363
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:26,970
Speaker 0: So I don't miss anything cuz there's a new song at the end and my parents are trying to get me out of the car.

364
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:35,010
Speaker 0: So we can go to the amusement park and I won't leave I won't move I won't acknowledge them because I don't want to miss any of that music any of that anything.

365
00:26:36,031 --> 00:26:38,020
Speaker 0: And I think my parents just thought I was a weird little kid.

366
00:26:38,461 --> 00:26:40,450
Speaker 0: Maybe I don't think they understood.

367
00:26:40,822 --> 00:26:41,632
Speaker 1: No probably not.

368
00:26:41,893 --> 00:26:49,007
Speaker 0: they'd always get mad if we had a game and I'd pause it to eat dinner and we keep running back into Unpause it and pause it again because we were afraid it would crash.

369
00:26:49,148 --> 00:26:51,819
Speaker 1: Yep I had that same fear cuz I had a game crash once.

370
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:56,161
Speaker 0: I think it was Wizards and Warriors 3 that came sucked By the way, it did suck ass.

371
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:56,967
Speaker 1: That was all the elements.

372
00:26:57,208 --> 00:26:58,535
Speaker 0: Yeah I think that was two.

373
00:26:58,555 --> 00:27:03,983
Speaker 0: three was the one where you could like turn into a thief and you had to sneak past the ogre And you couldn't fucking save the game.

374
00:27:04,447 --> 00:27:06,636
Speaker 1: Whatever Wizards warriors not so great.

375
00:27:06,737 --> 00:27:08,825
Speaker 1: Um, yeah, there were basically two times.

376
00:27:08,885 --> 00:27:09,628
Speaker 1: I beat the game.

377
00:27:09,668 --> 00:27:11,673
Speaker 1: that were Lifelong memorable.

378
00:27:12,235 --> 00:27:13,560
Speaker 1: one of them was when I beat right.

379
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:14,986
Speaker 1: I think it might have been the first game.

380
00:27:15,046 --> 00:27:16,773
Speaker 1: I beat was Megaman 2.

381
00:27:16,773 --> 00:27:19,950
Speaker 0: Ah, that's a good game man - you know, it's I never beat that on hard.

382
00:27:20,411 --> 00:27:28,679
Speaker 1: I remember I think I beat it one morning really early before Saturday morning cartoons and it was like all Suspenseful there and like the alien came out.

383
00:27:28,699 --> 00:27:29,642
Speaker 1: It was like oh shits.

384
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:30,404
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

385
00:27:30,424 --> 00:27:31,306
Speaker 1: It's OMG.

386
00:27:31,728 --> 00:27:36,188
Speaker 1: Oh shits And nowadays is just like yeah alien did did did you did?

387
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:52,990
Speaker 0: The one that really stuck out for me or stood out for me was Final Fantasy 1 Because I the first time I played that game I got to the end but I had a crap party because I didn't know much about the game and I totally wasn't ready to win and I would add a level forever and I ended up just giving up and starting over.

388
00:27:53,791 --> 00:27:57,350
Speaker 0: So I get to the end again, and I'm leveled up and everything's going great.

389
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:02,510
Speaker 0: I'm like, okay I can do this and first I get to Tiamat and I'll skip that I'll get to the end.

390
00:28:02,911 --> 00:28:12,830
Speaker 0: So, uh, I get to the end of the game and just before I get to the final boss chaos The game totally fucks me over and two of my characters die including the white mage.

391
00:28:13,874 --> 00:28:20,549
Speaker 0: So I'm sitting there thinking son of a bitch Not to bring myself back to life.

392
00:28:21,651 --> 00:28:22,837
Speaker 0: Son of a bitch, you know what?

393
00:28:22,877 --> 00:28:25,509
Speaker 0: whatever I'm just gonna fight him and die and I'll come back here again.

394
00:28:26,011 --> 00:28:28,161
Speaker 0: So I just fight him and I won.

395
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:29,005
Speaker 0: Yep.

396
00:28:29,286 --> 00:28:30,792
Speaker 0: I won not that hard I just.

397
00:28:30,832 --> 00:28:39,145
Speaker 0: well partly because winning Final Fantasy 1 is pretty much random because chaos Might just cast X X X X on everyone or you might just cast fire one.

398
00:28:39,225 --> 00:28:39,908
Speaker 0: You really don't know.

399
00:28:39,928 --> 00:28:43,065
Speaker 1: Yeah It also depends a lot on your levels.

400
00:28:43,206 --> 00:28:44,453
Speaker 1: Yeah levels You can just win.

401
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:48,113
Speaker 1: the same thing happened to me when I fought Tiamat and he'll cast X X X X You'd be like whatever.

402
00:28:48,133 --> 00:28:51,005
Speaker 0: I was just about to fight Tiamat and then I'm thinking come on.

403
00:28:51,045 --> 00:28:51,548
Speaker 0: No war mech.

404
00:28:51,608 --> 00:28:52,050
Speaker 0: No war mech.

405
00:28:52,172 --> 00:28:52,781
Speaker 0: No, that's right.

406
00:28:52,842 --> 00:28:53,126
Speaker 0: All right

407
00:28:54,250 --> 00:28:55,435
Speaker 1: Say something about war mech

408
00:28:55,495 --> 00:28:57,221
Speaker 0: war that comes up in the last step

409
00:28:57,421 --> 00:29:08,283
Speaker 1: for anyone who doesn't know in Final Fantasy 1 at the end Of the game there's a bridge and you go over this bridge and I think every step you take on the bridge There's a 1 in 255 chance of the war mech appearing.

410
00:29:08,424 --> 00:29:12,315
Speaker 0: Yeah, basically lost civilization Technology from beyond time.

411
00:29:12,837 --> 00:29:19,849
Speaker 0: and there's this nuclear machine and there's a tiny chance You'll run into it and basically it'll fuck you up.

412
00:29:20,412 --> 00:29:24,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it was always this cool thing because most people didn't even know about it.

413
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:27,830
Speaker 1: And you know some kids would be like no, I thought that I had to fight the war mech.

414
00:29:27,910 --> 00:29:31,209
Speaker 1: But what war make you talking about, you know, like a lot of people didn't believe you.

415
00:29:31,571 --> 00:29:33,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was like 1 in 255 people saw the war mech or so.

416
00:29:36,072 --> 00:29:39,722
Speaker 0: Well, it was 1 in 255 times the number of steps.

417
00:29:39,802 --> 00:29:41,427
Speaker 1: Yes, but it wasn't that many steps.

418
00:29:41,487 --> 00:29:42,390
Speaker 1: It wasn't the longest bridge.

419
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, war mech's main attack was called thermonuclear.

420
00:29:45,521 --> 00:29:50,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, and not too pleasant for the party He brought me down to one fighter who was practically dead.

421
00:29:50,770 --> 00:29:52,134
Speaker 0: So I said fuck it fought Tiamat.

422
00:29:52,255 --> 00:29:59,583
Speaker 0: and uh, I kicked Tiamat's ass in two hits because Tiamat decided to waste a whole round Basically cast in a spell that didn't do anything.

423
00:29:59,703 --> 00:30:05,634
Speaker 1: Yeah the next game I beat after Mega Man 2 was of course Zelda 1 Which you know.

424
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:11,939
Speaker 1: nowadays I could beat Zelda 1 in like an hour if I don't even try that hard, you know Well, you know where everything is.

425
00:30:11,979 --> 00:30:13,269
Speaker 0: there was a time when you didn't know.

426
00:30:13,551 --> 00:30:37,656
Speaker 1: so this was a Zelda game that I had played from beginning to end as a kid who didn't know anything with no help and It spent hours and hours and hours and hours and hours Like I must have put like hundreds of hours into that game Just spending so long going back getting some coins going back buying something going back getting some bonds Bombing everything burning everything killing every bad guy a hundred times Beating bosses over and over

427
00:30:37,776 --> 00:30:39,561
Speaker 0: spending forever fighting those blue nights

428
00:30:39,682 --> 00:30:49,020
Speaker 1: figuring out freaking the last level map You know figuring out which way to go on but trial and error and not Knowing which stairs to take in which order to get.

429
00:30:49,060 --> 00:30:51,390
Speaker 0: figuring out where the last dungeon even was.

430
00:30:51,732 --> 00:30:52,838
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.

431
00:30:52,879 --> 00:31:01,723
Speaker 1: and after all those hours I was finally at Ganon and I had some friends over who also hadn't beaten it and it was like Totally well, and I beat him with only the silver arrow.

432
00:31:02,205 --> 00:31:02,627
Speaker 1: damn.

433
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:08,765
Speaker 1: Yep I ended the game because I knew that when he teleported he moved around the room and sort of a clockwise fashion You know.

434
00:31:09,231 --> 00:31:10,235
Speaker 1: so I was just.

435
00:31:10,295 --> 00:31:22,169
Speaker 1: I would shoot silver hours at the middle of the room up the right of the room up the middle of The room up the left of the room up the middle of the room up the right of the room and I brought in all These coins with me and eventually he appeared red and I shot him with.

436
00:31:22,209 --> 00:31:24,601
Speaker 1: you know I got him and he was like, holy shit.

437
00:31:24,801 --> 00:31:29,364
Speaker 0: You got actually speaking to Zelda I think the like the other really big with my red potions.

438
00:31:29,847 --> 00:31:30,490
Speaker 0: I read potion.

439
00:31:30,678 --> 00:31:35,157
Speaker 0: Yeah I just always wondered because they always offered you the blue potion Like you could buy it.

440
00:31:35,217 --> 00:31:37,590
Speaker 1: a blue potion is if you were poor and you need to do so.

441
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:39,869
Speaker 0: No, if you're poor you got and get some freaking rupees.

442
00:31:40,351 --> 00:31:43,300
Speaker 1: But what if you need some potion to get some rupees?

443
00:31:43,621 --> 00:31:44,203
Speaker 0: you don't.

444
00:31:44,604 --> 00:31:48,749
Speaker 1: you can get rupees anywhere just kill stuff But you can always go to the ferry which is the thing.

445
00:31:49,011 --> 00:31:51,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, so pretty much you had to be stupid to buy the blue potion.

446
00:31:52,084 --> 00:31:57,649
Speaker 0: Yeah, and most of the time yeah, it was kind of like giving up the Heart instead of the money.

447
00:31:59,953 --> 00:32:01,970
Speaker 1: Even on the first play of the game.

448
00:32:02,130 --> 00:32:06,910
Speaker 1: I was not so dumb as to take the heart or the potion instead of the heart.

449
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:14,536
Speaker 0: Yep But the prime my most my most triumphant moment in beating a game because honestly as a kid as much as I love Zelda 2 I never beat it.

450
00:32:14,938 --> 00:32:15,581
Speaker 0: I couldn't beat it.

451
00:32:15,641 --> 00:32:16,786
Speaker 1: That game was really hard.

452
00:32:16,806 --> 00:32:17,450
Speaker 1: I didn't beat it.

453
00:32:17,992 --> 00:32:27,270
Speaker 0: well at our IT as a kid anyway, we had Zelda 2 on the GameCube and Scott and I had a friendly wager like let's just see who beats it first and Scott got kind of ahead.

454
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:36,624
Speaker 0: But then I really started catching up and one day I was home and I had like an hour to kill before I went to Anime Club and Scott was already over there or on his way at work or something.

455
00:32:37,127 --> 00:32:42,930
Speaker 0: So I'm thinking alright I'm just gonna play Zelda 2 in practice because I got to beat this before him and I'm fighting through the last dungeon.

456
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,046
Speaker 0: I'm fighting and fighting and I make it to the Thunderbird and I got one life left.

457
00:32:48,167 --> 00:32:51,870
Speaker 0: as in if I die It's over and I don't even have much magic.

458
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,959
Speaker 0: I had enough magic to cast like Thunder and then jump.

459
00:32:55,019 --> 00:32:56,303
Speaker 0: I couldn't even cast shield.

460
00:32:56,323 --> 00:33:00,778
Speaker 0: Wow, so I'm like, alright I'm just gonna fight it until I die and I'm fighting it.

461
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,304
Speaker 0: and I'm fighting it and I'm fighting it.

462
00:33:02,665 --> 00:33:05,570
Speaker 0: and as I'm whittling it Down, I'm think like more and more.

463
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:10,486
Speaker 0: It's like I hope I just die because the closer I get the more it's gonna suck.

464
00:33:10,526 --> 00:33:13,878
Speaker 0: when I finally do die Yep, and I ended up beating the game.

465
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:17,070
Speaker 0: So I go I. this seemed to be a trend with me.

466
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,730
Speaker 0: I always beat and Nintendo games when I think I'm not gonna beat him.

467
00:33:21,092 --> 00:33:24,990
Speaker 0: I think it's almost like if I'm going in like I'm gonna beat this the pressures on.

468
00:33:25,491 --> 00:33:33,588
Speaker 0: But if I've already resigned myself to losing the pressures off and now I move into this like Zen state of beating a Nintendo game Mmm doesn't work in real life at all.

469
00:33:33,871 --> 00:33:40,067
Speaker 1: And when our Zelda competition I did get to the last level and then I just didn't care it we were both like at the end and it just sucked.

470
00:33:40,087 --> 00:33:42,501
Speaker 0: but So I go to the RIT anime club

471
00:33:42,542 --> 00:33:42,964
Speaker 1: and you

472
00:33:43,206 --> 00:33:55,130
Speaker 0: know, I'm the president I get to talk in front of the club before the thing and Scott's in the audience and I stand up there and I'm like Before we begin I have a very important personal announcement to make and this is something really near and dear to me.

473
00:33:55,592 --> 00:34:00,217
Speaker 0: it's something that took a lot of blood and sweat and tears and I Really got to get this off my chest.

474
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:04,474
Speaker 0: to all of you out there and the whole club's like, uh-oh What's going on?

475
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:05,539
Speaker 0: It's rim coming out.

476
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:06,542
Speaker 0: Does rim have cancer.

477
00:34:06,563 --> 00:34:07,506
Speaker 0: Did he just kill a man?

478
00:34:07,526 --> 00:34:08,369
Speaker 0: What's going on?

479
00:34:09,270 --> 00:34:17,969
Speaker 0: both and then I turn to Scott and say just before club I Beat Zelda 2 for the first and Scott stands up and says no you didn't that's a lie.

480
00:34:18,291 --> 00:34:19,616
Speaker 0: and I'm like, no I did.

481
00:34:19,877 --> 00:34:22,125
Speaker 0: you can go look at the little triforce symbol over link.

482
00:34:22,366 --> 00:34:26,210
Speaker 0: I beat the game and Maybe it's just because there were people in the audience.

483
00:34:26,251 --> 00:34:26,928
Speaker 0: They were all geeks.

484
00:34:27,511 --> 00:34:34,429
Speaker 0: But I got a standing ovation and I will probably never in my life again get a standing ovation for beating a vid you game.

485
00:34:36,692 --> 00:34:38,344
Speaker 1: Let's not start doing that why not?

486
00:34:38,646 --> 00:34:39,149
Speaker 1: that's no good.

487
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:48,574
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically after like those early days of NES game beating like game beating became not such a big deal Really?

488
00:34:48,594 --> 00:34:54,784
Speaker 1: I think part of it was I mean like Beating half even beating amazing games like half-life 2 like.

489
00:34:54,864 --> 00:34:56,550
Speaker 1: it's a lot more fun to play than to beat.

490
00:34:56,751 --> 00:34:57,334
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

491
00:34:57,816 --> 00:34:59,424
Speaker 0: I never beat half-life 1.

492
00:34:59,424 --> 00:35:00,409
Speaker 0: I got all the way to the end.

493
00:35:00,811 --> 00:35:02,016
Speaker 1: I got to the thought you beat it.

494
00:35:02,317 --> 00:35:03,621
Speaker 0: No, I got to the very end.

495
00:35:03,662 --> 00:35:09,184
Speaker 0: I got to the giant alien fetus thing Yep, and at that point I was like, wow, I pretty much beat it.

496
00:35:09,204 --> 00:35:09,887
Speaker 0: This just isn't fun.

497
00:35:09,928 --> 00:35:10,470
Speaker 0: this last part.

498
00:35:10,751 --> 00:35:12,661
Speaker 1: Oh, you gotta beat it cuz the endings actually pretty.

499
00:35:12,762 --> 00:35:13,566
Speaker 0: I watched the ending.

500
00:35:13,989 --> 00:35:17,947
Speaker 0: All right Yeah, I base because if my game came with a save game at the end.

501
00:35:17,967 --> 00:35:21,862
Speaker 0: Oh Alrighty then so I just I skipped the final battle.

502
00:35:21,902 --> 00:35:22,946
Speaker 0: just cuz the battle wasn't fun.

503
00:35:22,966 --> 00:35:23,950
Speaker 0: I tried it for like five minutes.

504
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:28,773
Speaker 0: Yeah, you've got to like bounce up and throw grenades in its head, but I beat the rest of that alien world And that was great.

505
00:35:29,114 --> 00:35:29,335
Speaker 0: Yeah.

506
00:35:29,817 --> 00:35:33,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's the thing with the FPS is always more fun to play than they are to beat.

507
00:35:33,571 --> 00:35:37,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, well then again, it depends like the single-player quake one quake two wasn't even fun to play.

508
00:35:39,254 --> 00:35:40,160
Speaker 1: It was somewhat fun to play.

509
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,690
Speaker 0: I didn't play either one at all.

510
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:48,289
Speaker 1: I think the problem is that they weren't quite half-life 2 with the fun like, you know other non shooting stuff.

511
00:35:49,112 --> 00:35:52,510
Speaker 1: But they weren't quite serious Sam with the all-out shoot him up either

512
00:35:52,691 --> 00:35:57,870
Speaker 0: Hey, but then doom 2 was fun to play but beating it was such an accomplishment

513
00:35:59,091 --> 00:36:03,990
Speaker 1: Really like I beat all the different things to doom and all you got with those screens of text and it felt like shit.

514
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:06,077
Speaker 0: You beat doom - yeah, did you?

515
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:07,682
Speaker 0: yeah on ultra violence?

516
00:36:08,043 --> 00:36:08,243
Speaker 0: Yeah.

517
00:36:08,845 --> 00:36:10,310
Speaker 1: Ah, you go and you kill commander keen.

518
00:36:11,091 --> 00:36:13,180
Speaker 0: No, that's in the bonus levels.

519
00:36:13,300 --> 00:36:14,164
Speaker 1: Yes the bonus level.

520
00:36:14,184 --> 00:36:15,067
Speaker 0: It's not the end of the game.

521
00:36:15,108 --> 00:36:15,650
Speaker 1: That's the end?

522
00:36:15,811 --> 00:36:16,355
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

523
00:36:16,516 --> 00:36:18,229
Speaker 1: it is that comes after the end.

524
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,756
Speaker 0: No those two levels are just at the end.

525
00:36:20,876 --> 00:36:27,655
Speaker 0: if you cheat because that's the number indexes where they put them those levels actually take place in Last third of the game.

526
00:36:27,956 --> 00:36:31,931
Speaker 0: if you take the secret exit you do those two levels and then you pick back up where you left Off.

527
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:34,297
Speaker 0: I'm 100% sure.

528
00:36:34,418 --> 00:36:38,870
Speaker 0: are you going to risk your reputation as a geek on the internet by defying me?

529
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:43,119
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I don't know Internet, I will bet Scott a thousand dollars.

530
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:43,701
Speaker 0: that I'm right.

531
00:36:43,761 --> 00:36:45,046
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I don't know about that.

532
00:36:45,287 --> 00:36:45,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're wrong.

533
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:46,875
Speaker 1: That's all I said.

534
00:36:47,116 --> 00:36:47,418
Speaker 0: We're gonna.

535
00:36:47,438 --> 00:36:49,066
Speaker 0: you're gonna look it up and you're gonna feel real bad.

536
00:36:49,348 --> 00:36:55,995
Speaker 0: Maybe Actually beating doom 2 on co-op was so much more satisfying than beating it by myself Even though it was easier.

537
00:36:56,096 --> 00:36:56,619
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

538
00:36:56,941 --> 00:36:58,389
Speaker 0: well I take that back.

539
00:36:58,792 --> 00:37:09,772
Speaker 0: It was easier half the time and the other half of the time I'd get randomly Shotgunned and then I hear laughing on the other end of the phone something like that What are they like?

540
00:37:09,792 --> 00:37:11,074
Speaker 1: I beat like all them.

541
00:37:11,214 --> 00:37:18,463
Speaker 1: well actually Super Metroid is something to be pretty awesome, but Oh, actually, yeah Metroid games in general are pretty awesome.

542
00:37:18,483 --> 00:37:27,023
Speaker 1: to beat mostly the 2d ones But the 3d ones again beating them not as good as playing like when you you're in the end You're just like ah shit.

543
00:37:27,043 --> 00:37:27,870
Speaker 1: There's no more to play.

544
00:37:27,950 --> 00:37:28,915
Speaker 1: I just want to keep playing.

545
00:37:29,196 --> 00:37:38,532
Speaker 0: actually one game that my brother and I would beat when we were kids Semi regularly it was kind of like the hey you want to go beat such-and-such right now and two hours later We'd beat.

546
00:37:38,552 --> 00:37:42,930
Speaker 0: such-and-such was a guerilla war for the NES a game where you have infinity lives.

547
00:37:43,191 --> 00:37:49,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, you have infinity lies and you kill infinity bad guys with a bunch of bullets and tanks And it's super fun.

548
00:37:49,459 --> 00:37:50,889
Speaker 1: and you get killed infinity times.

549
00:37:51,151 --> 00:37:59,662
Speaker 0: And when you get to the end the game gives you all these outtakes and the credits are really really funny after you kill Fidel Castro, how about beating bionic commando there?

550
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:07,588
Speaker 0: beating bionic commando is Special because on one I don't know if any of you have ever played Hitler no fukatsu aka bionic commando.

551
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:16,161
Speaker 0: But they Nintendo had this big thing where they didn't want anything that was untoward for children in games at all And they super freaked out.

552
00:38:16,181 --> 00:38:19,720
Speaker 0: they were super censoring But they didn't always check the game so much.

553
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:22,170
Speaker 0: and bionic commando was about Nazis.

554
00:38:22,491 --> 00:38:27,689
Speaker 0: But they took all the Nazis out in the US and replaced him with basically nothing like big iron eagles instead.

555
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:44,270
Speaker 0: But at the end of the game you wake up the evil guy who they're trying to resurrect and they call him Master D, but it's clearly Adolf Hitler and he's naked And he says the word damn and then he blows up in a pile of gore.

556
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:46,463
Speaker 0: Nice, and as a little kid.

557
00:38:46,483 --> 00:38:47,250
Speaker 0: I just thought that was awesome.

558
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:49,874
Speaker 0: Plus beating that game.

559
00:38:49,914 --> 00:38:55,230
Speaker 0: you're likened unto a god if you beat that game all the way through without dying without dying.

560
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the ice I guess you could practice it enough to do it.

561
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:01,403
Speaker 0: But even just beating the game is really freaking hard.

562
00:39:01,444 --> 00:39:02,770
Speaker 0: at the end those last couple of levels.

563
00:39:03,173 --> 00:39:05,430
Speaker 1: Yeah, you gotta you gotta have a strategy for the game.

564
00:39:05,470 --> 00:39:07,744
Speaker 1: You know you get fair which levels to go to in which order?

565
00:39:07,824 --> 00:39:08,730
Speaker 1: to get the right items.

566
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,610
Speaker 1: But not do don't do anything unnecessary and at the really tricky parts.

567
00:39:12,630 --> 00:39:14,345
Speaker 1: We have to swing over spikes and fire.

568
00:39:14,365 --> 00:39:15,552
Speaker 1: you got to do it Just right.

569
00:39:15,833 --> 00:39:20,629
Speaker 0: see when you really think about it though most of the endings to NES games were super lame like mr.

570
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:28,170
Speaker 0: Miyagi winks, or it says congratulations want to play the same game again He'd start or even Zelda like The Legend of Zelda.

571
00:39:28,270 --> 00:39:36,206
Speaker 1: the only reason the ending is okay is because you get to see Zelda and you get to see Ganon and Just scrolls a bunch of text and then you're there holding the Triforce.

572
00:39:36,247 --> 00:39:36,870
Speaker 0: now think of this.

573
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:38,482
Speaker 0: This is something I just realized just now.

574
00:39:38,784 --> 00:39:51,908
Speaker 0: I knew it about Metroid But Metroid and The Legend of Zelda were two interesting games in that the title Characters or the things in the title are not ever seen in any capacity until the very end of the game.

575
00:39:52,269 --> 00:39:54,403
Speaker 0: in Metroid You don't see a Metroid forever.

576
00:39:54,423 --> 00:39:54,968
Speaker 0: Metroid.

577
00:39:55,491 --> 00:39:55,712
Speaker 0: You know.

578
00:39:55,732 --> 00:39:59,648
Speaker 0: you forget that there's this Metroid in the game, and I'm right - yeah.

579
00:40:00,992 --> 00:40:05,164
Speaker 0: And the Legend of Zelda you don't see Zelda at all until you win.

580
00:40:05,184 --> 00:40:05,846
Speaker 1: Yep.

581
00:40:06,308 --> 00:40:07,130
Speaker 0: I think that's kind of neat.

582
00:40:07,373 --> 00:40:17,049
Speaker 1: I do think that's kind of neat But and I think that was a reason why the endings to those games affected us as kids so much, but at the same time Those endings don't hold up so much anymore.

583
00:40:17,291 --> 00:40:19,038
Speaker 0: Well, I think they do for a different reason.

584
00:40:19,078 --> 00:40:22,616
Speaker 0: the reason the endings affected us wasn't so much that we saw something That was a big part of it.

585
00:40:22,656 --> 00:40:27,964
Speaker 0: Don't get me wrong, but I think part of it was just that Nintendo games to put it in the vernacular.

586
00:40:28,005 --> 00:40:29,190
Speaker 0: We're fucking hard.

587
00:40:29,591 --> 00:40:31,779
Speaker 0: You couldn't beat them you would like.

588
00:40:31,799 --> 00:40:34,830
Speaker 0: you couldn't beat all the Nintendo games no matter how hardcore you were back.

589
00:40:35,392 --> 00:40:39,370
Speaker 0: You would pick like four games or ten games, and you'd be like I'm gonna beat this game.

590
00:40:39,391 --> 00:40:41,454
Speaker 0: And it was like this Battle of will.

591
00:40:41,474 --> 00:40:45,206
Speaker 1: that goes back to our episode about save games because you know when you could.

592
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:47,930
Speaker 1: when you can save a game you Can beat it more readily?

593
00:40:48,110 --> 00:40:48,552
Speaker 1: It's actually.

594
00:40:48,572 --> 00:40:56,479
Speaker 1: it basically makes your odds of beating the game one whereas without save games It's now really difficult to beat a game.

595
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:59,790
Speaker 1: because now not only can you do you have to repeat parts?

596
00:40:59,890 --> 00:41:14,930
Speaker 1: You've already done But you have to repeat parts You've already done in order to practice the new part and if you fail at practicing the new part you have to do it all again whereas With a safe game you can just brute force each part of the game in order till it's done.

597
00:41:15,412 --> 00:41:18,826
Speaker 0: Yep, that's sadly what happened to me with both of the Castlevania's for the DS.

598
00:41:18,846 --> 00:41:21,300
Speaker 0: while I really liked them Especially the second one.

599
00:41:21,360 --> 00:41:22,689
Speaker 0: I totally just brute forced it.

600
00:41:23,091 --> 00:41:24,297
Speaker 0: I didn't even try.

601
00:41:24,317 --> 00:41:31,167
Speaker 1: and the thing that gets me about a lot of those games They put all this cool stuff in the games that you don't need to use in order to win at all.

602
00:41:31,871 --> 00:41:35,350
Speaker 0: It's why is it even there like in the first Castlevania for the DS?

603
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:42,484
Speaker 0: I leveled up a bunch of weapons But then I realized that Why don't I just level up the axe all the way and just use the axe?

604
00:41:42,544 --> 00:41:44,310
Speaker 0: because it's clearly the best weapon in the game.

605
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,258
Speaker 0: There's no reason to ever use anything else.

606
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:47,524
Speaker 1: I wanted to use the guns.

607
00:41:47,604 --> 00:41:52,585
Speaker 1: I wanted to use the knives I wanted to use the swords, but they all sucked compared to like the axe and the spear.

608
00:41:52,986 --> 00:41:53,890
Speaker 1: so I just hear whatever.

609
00:41:54,231 --> 00:42:02,890
Speaker 0: I always use the axe and the fist because the fist was the fastest thing in case I needed to disrupt an enemy's attack like That one boss and the axe was just to kill everything.

610
00:42:03,292 --> 00:42:07,890
Speaker 1: I use the axes and the Spears because the Spears are longer that I like to keep bad guys away from me.

611
00:42:08,111 --> 00:42:09,818
Speaker 0: The axe did so much more damage.

612
00:42:09,858 --> 00:42:10,140
Speaker 1: I did.

613
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:18,497
Speaker 1: I use the axe actually the secondary weapon axe I used more than anything because that's that arc that makes it you know Perfect for hitting pretty much every bad guy in the game.

614
00:42:18,658 --> 00:42:18,898
Speaker 0: Yep.

615
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,784
Speaker 0: I also use that bone vacuum a lot.

616
00:42:20,804 --> 00:42:24,088
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Really liked it.

617
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:28,570
Speaker 1: Games like the end was just unsatisfying.

618
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:30,579
Speaker 1: It's like I like playing the games.

619
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:36,530
Speaker 1: the feeling I get playing the game is what I want And I guess the best ending I can hope for is more game.

620
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:41,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think part of that contributes to there's no the carrot at like those games.

621
00:42:41,465 --> 00:42:42,830
Speaker 0: beating was a foregone conclusion.

622
00:42:43,132 --> 00:42:45,589
Speaker 0: It's just a matter of putting in the time and that's it and you'll just beat it.

623
00:42:46,092 --> 00:42:49,310
Speaker 0: So I feel like my interest in the game can wane.

624
00:42:49,672 --> 00:42:53,009
Speaker 0: Like there are a lot of games that I start playing I get near the end like the second DS.

625
00:42:53,431 --> 00:42:58,330
Speaker 0: I got real close to the end of Castlevania DS the second one and then I just stopped and I just stopped caring and I Have.

626
00:42:58,411 --> 00:42:59,093
Speaker 0: I've yet to beat it.

627
00:42:59,535 --> 00:43:00,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just didn't care.

628
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:07,600
Speaker 0: but a game like I don't know Gradius or Mario 1 I want to get to the end like beating.

629
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:10,490
Speaker 0: the game is like the thing and if I'd it's like a Boolean.

630
00:43:10,611 --> 00:43:12,599
Speaker 0: It's not like I beat 80% of the game.

631
00:43:12,660 --> 00:43:17,689
Speaker 0: It's I beat the game or I didn't yep Game beating a long lost art.

632
00:43:18,528 --> 00:43:26,264
Speaker 1: I Guess there's some games though with plots like Final Fantasies where you want to get to the end to see the plot But that's because you don't want to play Final Fantasy.

633
00:43:26,284 --> 00:43:27,490
Speaker 1: You just want to see the plot.

634
00:43:27,892 --> 00:43:35,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, there was a time when I really wanted to play Final Fantasy though I got to admit I never actually bothered playing Final Fantasy Tactics just because I didn't have a PlayStation.

635
00:43:36,027 --> 00:43:42,190
Speaker 0: and I'm Finally playing Tactics Advance and I'm really digging it and I worry that I might get into these types of games again.

636
00:43:42,792 --> 00:43:44,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, I might there's a lot of crap.

637
00:43:44,639 --> 00:43:52,031
Speaker 0: I can make the little math and I can make the clan and I could build the Clan up and I can fight for territory and I can level up my dudes and I can trade the items in the classes and The jobs.

638
00:43:52,071 --> 00:43:54,398
Speaker 1: and I've beaten golden Sun one once.

639
00:43:54,518 --> 00:43:55,240
Speaker 1: but I might go.

640
00:43:55,681 --> 00:44:14,221
Speaker 1: I got halfway through golden Sun 2 before I stopped and I think I might go back and do that because Like the only reason I stopped playing golden Sun 2 halfway through is because there's a point you reach in the game where you have To do a bunch of management that I don't want to do and it's just like I wanted to beat the game But I didn't want to do the management of items and stuff.

641
00:44:14,683 --> 00:44:15,025
Speaker 1: I don't know.

642
00:44:15,547 --> 00:44:21,089
Speaker 0: Yeah at any rate We should probably stop because I like I said, we have to do a lot of podcasting tonight.

643
00:44:21,309 --> 00:44:22,653
Speaker 1: Yep I'm gonna go do my laundry.

644
00:44:22,914 --> 00:44:28,910
Speaker 0: However, stay tuned tomorrow night because then we will be covering Kinetic on 2007, which was freaking awesome.

645
00:44:28,930 --> 00:44:34,030
Speaker 0: And I would just like to say now but we'll talk about this a lot tomorrow that Steve Bennett is now my man.

646
00:44:34,572 --> 00:44:35,838
Speaker 0: Oh, I'm really.

647
00:44:35,858 --> 00:44:36,903
Speaker 0: I like Steve Bennett.

648
00:44:36,984 --> 00:44:38,150
Speaker 1: He's no longer scary.

649
00:44:38,977 --> 00:44:45,370
Speaker 0: He was scary and kind of this Imposing way cuz I you know, we'd heard all I thought he was scary in some sort of a perverted way.

650
00:44:45,410 --> 00:44:49,210
Speaker 0: Well, you see you hear all the rumors about people like all the people in the anime industry.

651
00:44:49,632 --> 00:44:59,169
Speaker 0: But regardless of what may or may not be true Steve Bennett on the anime match game Was perhaps the best anime match game contestant the world has ever seen.

652
00:44:59,671 --> 00:45:01,358
Speaker 1: He was a panelist a panelist.

653
00:45:01,378 --> 00:45:03,325
Speaker 1: same difference, I guess in that respect.

654
00:45:03,365 --> 00:45:08,460
Speaker 1: Yes, I would have to agree this Contestants is an excellent anime match game panelist.

655
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:10,927
Speaker 0: Perhaps the best the man has charisma.
