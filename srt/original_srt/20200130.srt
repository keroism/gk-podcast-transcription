4
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:22,487
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,532 --> 00:00:33,730
Speaker 0: So the weather's been a bit weird and I haven't actually gotten to ski this season until last weekend Which was bugging me to see while you can because eventually there won't be any more skiing anywhere.

6
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:37,424
Speaker 1: Yep, I guess you could ski on like Mountain big bars.

7
00:00:37,444 --> 00:00:42,868
Speaker 0: Yeah Mount Olympus I'll just have to move further and further north as the world goes to shit.

8
00:00:44,195 --> 00:00:45,189
Speaker 1: Is it north to Mars?

9
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:50,139
Speaker 0: But So it is finally cold enough.

10
00:00:50,159 --> 00:00:58,751
Speaker 0: Like I'm gonna get some real skiing in the next several weekends I'm gonna try to ski every single weekend until I go to Japan on that trip assuming coronavirus doesn't prevent my trip to Japan Is?

11
00:00:58,812 --> 00:01:03,470
Speaker 1: it is a. you know, not that I would ever ski right but is on Super Bowl Sunday.

12
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:04,995
Speaker 1: Is there more or less?

13
00:01:05,075 --> 00:01:06,059
Speaker 0: It's the best fucking day.

14
00:01:06,079 --> 00:01:06,722
Speaker 0: There's no ski.

15
00:01:07,063 --> 00:01:07,886
Speaker 0: There's no.

16
00:01:08,086 --> 00:01:09,030
Speaker 0: you go to a ski mountain.

17
00:01:09,231 --> 00:01:15,010
Speaker 1: I think there are a lot of people would be like hey, we could like ski and yeah I just at like, you know five o'clock come into the lodge.

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,689
Speaker 0: Yeah They do but here's the thing.

19
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:21,570
Speaker 0: Those people they those are the kinds of people who tend to only ski a little bit.

20
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,490
Speaker 0: Anyway, like they go to the mountain they pay they're like hundred bucks for a ticket.

21
00:01:24,972 --> 00:01:28,850
Speaker 0: They ski like four times and then they're done and then they sit in the bar and then they go out to Super Bowl.

22
00:01:29,252 --> 00:01:31,727
Speaker 0: If you go ski, I'm so but the lodge is crazy busy.

23
00:01:31,747 --> 00:01:40,290
Speaker 0: Yep Okay So if you go to scan Super Bowl weekend The only people actually skiing are people who care a lot about skiing and don't care that much about the Super Bowl.

24
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:41,053
Speaker 1: Oh, that's next week.

25
00:01:41,253 --> 00:01:41,474
Speaker 0: Yep.

26
00:01:41,936 --> 00:01:43,983
Speaker 1: Actually, it's in right Thursday, right?

27
00:01:44,003 --> 00:01:44,565
Speaker 1: It's three days.

28
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:48,576
Speaker 0: So this week This weekend it is not next week.

29
00:01:48,596 --> 00:01:49,840
Speaker 0: It isn't three days or next week.

30
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:50,943
Speaker 1: It is the next weekend.

31
00:01:51,003 --> 00:01:51,224
Speaker 0: Yep.

32
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:59,722
Speaker 0: So, uh, I'm No, it is actually this weekend on next weekend This this week next one the one that's coming up next.

33
00:02:00,304 --> 00:02:01,006
Speaker 0: Yeah this one.

34
00:02:01,026 --> 00:02:05,286
Speaker 0: Yeah next one Yeah, so Scott if I say this Tuesday this Thursday, we're gonna do something.

35
00:02:05,306 --> 00:02:06,090
Speaker 1: That's not today.

36
00:02:06,432 --> 00:02:09,668
Speaker 0: All right, if I say this Friday, what day when does the thing happen?

37
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:10,871
Speaker 1: tomorrow?

38
00:02:11,232 --> 00:02:13,157
Speaker 0: what if I say next Friday as tomorrow?

39
00:02:13,237 --> 00:02:24,928
Speaker 0: also if I say next Friday today on Thursday, you literally would uh, Obstinately pretend that I meant tomorrow as opposed to the next Thursday like literally every English speaker would believe.

40
00:02:25,128 --> 00:02:27,515
Speaker 1: there are lots of Inconsistencies in the English language.

41
00:02:27,877 --> 00:02:30,144
Speaker 1: just because it is inconsistent doesn't mean it's wrong.

42
00:02:30,325 --> 00:02:31,830
Speaker 1: flammable is in flammable.

43
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:32,755
Speaker 1: What's a country?

44
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:34,624
Speaker 0: but that's actually extremely consistent.

45
00:02:35,067 --> 00:02:35,509
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

46
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:43,770
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, uh, you said you had some news but you said before the show that your news is all news.

47
00:02:43,973 --> 00:02:44,687
Speaker 1: It is all news.

48
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,290
Speaker 0: So my my my supposition based on this cuz I don't know what you're about to say, I have no idea.

49
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:58,410
Speaker 0: Okay, but my guess is that I can sum up your summation of the news with a song.

50
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,618
Speaker 0: I don't you've ever heard this song.

51
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,209
Speaker 0: Have you ever heard the song called?

52
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:02,894
Speaker 0: Everybody knows shit's fucked.

53
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,340
Speaker 0: Well, I see even Paul Tyler.

54
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:08,774
Speaker 0: I mean you're close because the songs are Everybody knows shit's fucked.

55
00:03:09,055 --> 00:03:10,419
Speaker 0: I don't give a good goddamn.

56
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:12,104
Speaker 0: Your uncle Sam is a motherfucker.

57
00:03:12,545 --> 00:03:14,350
Speaker 0: fuck human beings fuck humanity.

58
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:16,086
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot of songs like that.

59
00:03:16,268 --> 00:03:20,457
Speaker 1: Yeah you can listen to Rage Against the Machine.

60
00:03:20,497 --> 00:03:31,028
Speaker 0: you can listen to monster by Steppenwolf 60s and that song is 90% still true, you know I wish I'd read Steppenwolf without when I was younger as opposed to reading it as a geek night's book.

61
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,097
Speaker 1: You can read it again.

62
00:03:33,117 --> 00:03:34,724
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I already read it.

63
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:39,009
Speaker 0: I know it's deal but I Thought that book was about different things.

64
00:03:39,341 --> 00:03:40,756
Speaker 1: Yeah I didn't know anything what it was about.

65
00:03:40,776 --> 00:03:47,009
Speaker 1: I only knew Steppenwolf the band and I know that there was a book called Steppenwolf and I didn't know what relation there was between the two if any.

66
00:03:47,049 --> 00:03:48,659
Speaker 0: yeah But I wish I'd known that when I was younger.

67
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:50,510
Speaker 1: Anyway now I know everything cuz I've been in it.

68
00:03:50,611 --> 00:03:52,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, the point is right.

69
00:03:52,763 --> 00:03:53,833
Speaker 1: Yeah We've had this.

70
00:03:53,933 --> 00:04:01,555
Speaker 1: everyone knows shit's fucked feeling for what like 15 to 20 years now mostly since December 2016.

71
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:03,341
Speaker 1: I mean that's you know more so right?

72
00:04:03,421 --> 00:04:11,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I feel as if like January 2020 specifically Right, we are crossing a boundary.

73
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:12,715
Speaker 1: Yeah of fucking this.

74
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:17,410
Speaker 0: know we're crossing a boundary into like for one like not to harp on the whole Trump thing.

75
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:21,284
Speaker 0: But that feels like it made time slow down and I've been paying like.

76
00:04:21,565 --> 00:04:22,890
Speaker 0: I already pay a lot of attention.

77
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,137
Speaker 0: Most people don't pay a lot of attention.

78
00:04:24,378 --> 00:04:24,941
Speaker 0: Some people do.

79
00:04:25,102 --> 00:04:36,469
Speaker 0: I pay you and I like we pay a lot But I'm paying even more attention and it's making time slow down and the more it slows down The more fucked up things I see in the matter I get and then I pay attention even more.

80
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:41,766
Speaker 1: But there's like an old saying like oh you couldn't you know, the life is stranger than fiction.

81
00:04:41,806 --> 00:04:43,110
Speaker 1: you couldn't write this, right?

82
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:45,806
Speaker 1: I mean, but actually but life right now, right?

83
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,710
Speaker 1: Literally, I'd say you couldn't write this but actually we did write this.

84
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:56,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like me in the onion and in like that movie strange days are like every William Gibson novel.

85
00:04:56,632 --> 00:04:59,413
Speaker 1: All right, let's list the things Right.

86
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:00,476
Speaker 0: All right.

87
00:05:00,577 --> 00:05:02,242
Speaker 1: It's like for the past 15 years.

88
00:05:02,282 --> 00:05:06,316
Speaker 1: There's been general overhead of Fuck it miss.

89
00:05:06,517 --> 00:05:26,182
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know things like climate change We're just still around and still a problem right sort of like this background of yeah shit is bad But we are now in this month specifically have added all those things are still there right, but we have added this other layer of Relatively somewhat immediate fuck it

90
00:05:26,202 --> 00:05:26,463
Speaker 0: miss.

91
00:05:26,564 --> 00:05:26,765
Speaker 0: Yeah.

92
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:27,670
Speaker 0: Well, that's right.

93
00:05:27,931 --> 00:05:42,263
Speaker 0: well, I think what it is is that multiple areas not just one area, but multiple areas have hit a Threshold like a crisis point whereby Depending on the results of things that will happen in our foreseeable future.

94
00:05:42,584 --> 00:05:48,186
Speaker 1: There are radically different futures All right, so we have all sorts of presidential situations like right now.

95
00:05:48,307 --> 00:05:48,869
Speaker 0: There's an impeachment.

96
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:54,172
Speaker 0: I'll have impeachment and election but we have a it's a scam impeachment trial We have.

97
00:05:54,232 --> 00:06:03,790
Speaker 0: our government is literally trying to cover up crimes the president committed like that's not a joke Cartoonishly Corrupt people like they're from a movie, right?

98
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:04,933
Speaker 1: So you got that.

99
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:09,210
Speaker 1: all that going on if less in other countries to like breaks it is actually kind of real.

100
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,499
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it happened the EU said fine.

101
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,001
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

102
00:06:12,062 --> 00:06:14,090
Speaker 0: Just fucking over with right.

103
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:14,893
Speaker 1: So that's so.

104
00:06:14,933 --> 00:06:21,057
Speaker 1: if you're writing a novel from you're writing this cyberpunk novel from an American's perspective Like that's like a background thing happening.

105
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:22,040
Speaker 1: That'll come in later.

106
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:22,963
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

107
00:06:23,304 --> 00:06:25,090
Speaker 1: Okay, so then there's a horrible pandemic.

108
00:06:26,172 --> 00:06:28,581
Speaker 1: That is a the World Health Organization said today.

109
00:06:28,601 --> 00:06:32,033
Speaker 1: it is like a global public health emergency Right.

110
00:06:32,334 --> 00:06:35,463
Speaker 1: That's not a thing that happened in my life.

111
00:06:35,865 --> 00:06:40,108
Speaker 1: Maybe not handful of times I mean if ever ours happens.

112
00:06:40,309 --> 00:06:42,620
Speaker 0: ours Was like the swine flu.

113
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:51,512
Speaker 1: Yeah, like that's there Flu being like a like lip specifically a global emergency though It wasn't.

114
00:06:51,552 --> 00:06:54,481
Speaker 0: it wasn't as much of an emergency as coronavirus and SARS.

115
00:06:54,601 --> 00:07:01,641
Speaker 0: right there have been margberg outbreaks and Ebola outbreaks There have been but this this one's moving pretty quick.

116
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:02,183
Speaker 1: Right?

117
00:07:02,263 --> 00:07:03,887
Speaker 1: Anyway, so that's happening.

118
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:07,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, right I don't really have anything to say about it.

119
00:07:07,679 --> 00:07:09,486
Speaker 0: Well, like here's just one example.

120
00:07:09,506 --> 00:07:12,935
Speaker 0: You're probably even thinking of Because of our politics is so fucked up.

121
00:07:12,996 --> 00:07:17,650
Speaker 0: Virginia actually became a democratic state like Democrats now control all the chambers of that state.

122
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:18,498
Speaker 0: So what did they do?

123
00:07:18,861 --> 00:07:19,750
Speaker 0: they passed some?

124
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:32,930
Speaker 0: Extremely incremental minor gun control reform bills and Armed fascist militias literally marched on the Capitol and threatened civil war like that happened and it was only a footnote in the news.

125
00:07:33,071 --> 00:07:40,542
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not a big enough news to qualify Literal brown shirts armed with AR like that's a tiny news.

126
00:07:40,582 --> 00:07:41,485
Speaker 0: Yeah in 2020.

127
00:07:41,485 --> 00:07:46,336
Speaker 0: Okay, that barely makes the news All right, so we have let's go Fire.

128
00:07:46,396 --> 00:07:49,013
Speaker 0: there's a state legislature Legislator.

129
00:07:49,053 --> 00:07:50,739
Speaker 1: keep focusing on too many government news.

130
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:52,845
Speaker 1: is I've already gone past all these government news.

131
00:07:52,885 --> 00:07:54,350
Speaker 0: He's a literal terrorist.

132
00:07:54,592 --> 00:07:55,923
Speaker 1: Yeah, whatever still in office.

133
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:56,710
Speaker 1: Let's take him out.

134
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:00,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, your news is our way tiny compared to the giant news.

135
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,750
Speaker 1: is Australia is literally on fire still probably I imagine.

136
00:08:03,971 --> 00:08:04,612
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

137
00:08:04,692 --> 00:08:05,234
Speaker 0: Okay.

138
00:08:05,615 --> 00:08:07,700
Speaker 1: What else is a giant news right now?

139
00:08:08,703 --> 00:08:19,110
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, I guess it's it's not really of Significance word, you know the liberation of Hong Kong or the subjugation of Hong Kong, which is that that's not over not over.

140
00:08:19,313 --> 00:08:20,550
Speaker 0: It's just not in the news anymore.

141
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,454
Speaker 0: This is the West right.

142
00:08:21,554 --> 00:08:30,190
Speaker 1: not a significant thing in terms of the actual consequences of the event But in terms of the news worthiness right is like Kobe Bryant and his helicopter exploding.

143
00:08:30,371 --> 00:08:35,245
Speaker 1: Yeah, got nothing to say about it, but it's still the kind of thing that in a cyberpunk novel.

144
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,710
Speaker 1: what happened, right?

145
00:08:38,113 --> 00:08:38,816
Speaker 1: What else is going on?

146
00:08:38,836 --> 00:08:41,328
Speaker 1: the Super Bowl is Sunday, oh who even cares?

147
00:08:41,349 --> 00:08:45,376
Speaker 0: I Forgot when the super like.

148
00:08:45,396 --> 00:08:47,021
Speaker 0: I didn't remember the Super Bowl existed.

149
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,050
Speaker 0: the last Super Bowl was a thousand years ago.

150
00:08:50,391 --> 00:08:52,562

00:08:53,849 --> 00:08:58,406
Speaker 0: Yes I feel like I just saw some Olympics which are only significant because Akira exists.

Speaker 1: I can't even even remember all of the ridiculous things.

156
00:09:05,433 --> 00:09:06,608
Speaker 0: So let's just back up a little bit.

157
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:11,264
Speaker 0: Don't forget that Russia just fucking like invaded Crimea and took it over.

158
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:12,387
Speaker 0: No one did anything about.

159
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:13,130
Speaker 1: that was a while ago.

160
00:09:13,310 --> 00:09:18,165
Speaker 0: Yeah in a thousand and ten years ago that talking about things that are news like like this week.

161
00:09:18,226 --> 00:09:21,720
Speaker 0: Yes Still ongoing.

162
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,735
Speaker 1: now sure There's just you know, the amount of insane More immediate things.

163
00:09:27,996 --> 00:09:33,610
Speaker 0: Paul Paul and storm like got arrested protesting the fake impeachment trial in Washington like yesterday.

164
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:41,736
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever yeah, like there's people like in the Capitol like daily getting arrested protesting this now That started yesterday.

165
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:45,350
Speaker 0: that seems like you're only reading government news is now I'm just bringing those up because you didn't mention them.

166
00:09:46,412 --> 00:09:47,181
Speaker 1: Government news is.

167
00:09:47,221 --> 00:09:47,970
Speaker 1: those are small news.

168
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,117
Speaker 0: Yeah But the government news is aren't that small?

169
00:09:50,157 --> 00:09:55,058
Speaker 0: because the government news is all lead to a global rise of fascism that threatens the very Fabric of human society.

170
00:09:55,078 --> 00:09:56,649
Speaker 1: I think you're focusing too much on that.

171
00:09:57,473 --> 00:09:59,381
Speaker 0: well, we don't defeat fascism.

172
00:09:59,441 --> 00:10:04,243
Speaker 0: we can't even start looking at climate change and Climate change is the cause a lot of those other problems.

173
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:09,081
Speaker 0: We can't even look at global Catastrophes if we can't even get our own fucking house in order here.

174
00:10:09,322 --> 00:10:11,390
Speaker 1: Look you're focused too much on where you are.

175
00:10:11,471 --> 00:10:13,569
Speaker 1: I'm talking about like world news level shit.

176
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:15,369
Speaker 0: Yeah I think without the u.s.

177
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:20,367
Speaker 0: Descending into literal fascism will have a drastic consequence on the entire globe.

178
00:10:20,748 --> 00:10:26,346
Speaker 1: pretty quick All right, the point is all right, right, you know focus on too many politics newses.

179
00:10:26,587 --> 00:10:32,570
Speaker 1: Okay global Right news situation right with all the shit going down.

180
00:10:32,810 --> 00:10:38,125
Speaker 1: It's like the the ever-present feeling of like, you know impending doom.

181
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:42,381
Speaker 1: Oh, I remember another one the The scientists with the doomsday clock.

182
00:10:42,401 --> 00:10:44,310
Speaker 1: They said it was at like what it was like a minute.

183
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:49,470
Speaker 0: So they said it's like four days a clock, but they move it completely arbitrarily whenever they feel like it.

184
00:10:49,570 --> 00:10:51,017
Speaker 1: it's yeah, but it's still.

185
00:10:51,419 --> 00:10:52,906
Speaker 1: you know, it's still real.

186
00:10:52,946 --> 00:10:53,569
Speaker 1: there's you know, the.

187
00:10:54,651 --> 00:11:04,430
Speaker 0: The various arms treaties are basically going like well But again, the arms treaties are almost all collapsing specifically and solely because of Republicans in American politics.

188
00:11:05,113 --> 00:11:07,442
Speaker 0: That's the only reason those arms treaties are failing.

189
00:11:07,684 --> 00:11:09,170
Speaker 1: That is not the Republicans.

190
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,570
Speaker 1: Are you focusing so much or not?

191
00:11:11,192 --> 00:11:14,687
Speaker 0: The real thing name what arms treaties like.

192
00:11:14,727 --> 00:11:15,470
Speaker 1: what are you talking about?

193
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,670
Speaker 1: I forget the name of the nose is what the nuclear one is the landmine one.

194
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:24,109
Speaker 1: This is a lie, I don't remember the names of these things because we lost a bunch of every one article.

195
00:11:24,169 --> 00:11:26,284
Speaker 1: that's like Oh, yeah, they've you know, we had this thing.

196
00:11:26,324 --> 00:11:31,562
Speaker 1: That's like In this kind of place and they're basically now ignoring that.

197
00:11:31,582 --> 00:11:34,190
Speaker 0: yeah all almost like literally all.

198
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:39,367
Speaker 0: But one or two of those treaty things that happened in the last few weeks were directly.

199
00:11:39,387 --> 00:11:43,269
Speaker 0: the US government Just said fuck it and tore it up because we have the power to do that and no one else really does.

200
00:11:43,774 --> 00:11:49,010
Speaker 1: anyway, the point is The general feeling that you always have shit is fucked.

201
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:56,403
Speaker 1: Yeah, it now like I'm almost like, you know, it is crossed the line to where it's like More than 0%.

202
00:11:56,403 --> 00:12:03,204
Speaker 1: I could see for example The corona virus being like actually a zombie movie for real and society is destroyed.

203
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:04,627
Speaker 0: see but that's I don't.

204
00:12:04,688 --> 00:12:07,634
Speaker 1: I don't think that's a. well I get large chance But that is my like.

205
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:13,890
Speaker 0: there is hardly magical thinking in the sense of because there are other bad things going on You and they are at a threshold crisis point.

206
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:20,830
Speaker 0: It's easy to see things that happen before under normal a similar situation two months ago if the virus came right?

207
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:24,518
Speaker 1: I would be like, you know You know, I wouldn't I wouldn't.

208
00:12:24,578 --> 00:12:27,528
Speaker 1: and you said there's gonna be the pandemic that destroys the world.

209
00:12:27,588 --> 00:12:28,756
Speaker 1: I'd be like, uh-huh Yeah, it's funny.

210
00:12:28,796 --> 00:12:32,958
Speaker 1: Well now I only 99.99999 percent think that's funny.

211
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:34,381
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, right?

212
00:12:34,923 --> 00:12:37,630
Speaker 1: Well, that is a significant move away from zero.

213
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:42,211
Speaker 0: Well thing is partly because 0.00001 is infinitely larger than zero partly Do is?

214
00:12:42,252 --> 00:12:46,330
Speaker 0: I always look at this kind of news from the perspective of what could be done.

215
00:12:47,115 --> 00:12:49,010
Speaker 0: Like is there something that could be done or not?

216
00:12:49,390 --> 00:12:52,290
Speaker 0: Because some things you can't do anything about like if the Sun you can't do anything.

217
00:12:52,350 --> 00:13:00,535
Speaker 0: Well, well you or like some local society or direct action like look at all the protests in France Which you didn't even mention.

218
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:07,823
Speaker 0: All right, uh, all I'm gonna say about that is Americans have to step up their like street action protest game.

219
00:13:08,305 --> 00:13:09,850
Speaker 0: take a take a look at France.

220
00:13:10,372 --> 00:13:11,677
Speaker 0: Direct action gets the good.

221
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:15,612
Speaker 1: someone brought up a really good point somewhere and that you know The people.

222
00:13:15,672 --> 00:13:17,318
Speaker 0: all the earthquakes there have been some.

223
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,466
Speaker 0: there have been multiple terrifying earthquakes recently.

224
00:13:19,486 --> 00:13:20,510
Speaker 1: I didn't hear about the earthquake.

225
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,094
Speaker 0: What really?

226
00:13:21,114 --> 00:13:22,282
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

227
00:13:22,363 --> 00:13:23,088
Speaker 1: That's a new one for me.

228
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:32,808
Speaker 1: but yeah That's the point This how can you do a news when basically there's just this giant pile of?

229
00:13:33,109 --> 00:13:47,663
Speaker 0: you know Cloud has gotten a Significant shade darker and I think like the real takeaway from all this is that all the problems that are making the news So dire today have been simmering for many decades.

230
00:13:47,723 --> 00:13:50,210
Speaker 1: as I'm saying is we were simmering and now we're boiling.

231
00:13:50,531 --> 00:13:53,481
Speaker 1: Yep, not boiling over but we're boiling.

232
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:57,193
Speaker 1: but that means that boiling over used to be like yeah It's not gonna happen now.

233
00:13:57,254 --> 00:14:00,145
Speaker 1: boiling over is like boiling over is.

234
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:05,602
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna just laugh it off But that that means we have to be we like the royal.

235
00:14:05,623 --> 00:14:12,387
Speaker 0: we have to be ready in some circumstances like there have to be some lines that get crossed across all these various things.

236
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:28,404
Speaker 0: where Certain forms of direct action happen where jobs don't matter anymore Where you'd like protest real street protests happen something general strikes like well, you're not gonna go I'm not going to any protest if the protest has all everyone virus and gonna die.

237
00:14:28,425 --> 00:14:31,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm staying inside Protesting with my computer.

238
00:14:32,081 --> 00:14:32,324
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

239
00:14:32,929 --> 00:14:49,050
Speaker 0: I big for for my entire career weirdly like as a total aside like the job I've had at Every company I've worked for except the US government when I worked for the census that one time has and all my like piddly jobs in high school.

240
00:14:49,110 --> 00:15:00,586
Speaker 0: and Like when I was at RIT one of my roles was part of risk assessment and one of my roles was always to document and Like maintain the things we do in the event of a global pandemic.

241
00:15:00,626 --> 00:15:04,480
Speaker 0: like oddly specifically That was the thing I've been responsible for at a lot of companies.

242
00:15:05,022 --> 00:15:07,010
Speaker 1: Why don't you make that your specialty instead of clock setting?

243
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:15,442
Speaker 0: Uh doesn't pay that much And I'm not responsible for it at my current job But I have to know a lot about how it would go.

244
00:15:15,462 --> 00:15:22,487
Speaker 1: that is like here's a completely, you know Tangential point has nothing right but that you just reminded me of as just a general good life advice.

245
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:25,337
Speaker 1: Yeah There was this point where I was listening.

246
00:15:25,377 --> 00:15:36,119
Speaker 1: lots of you know interviews with famous or not or at least significant people or people had Something in you know, yeah, right and you know people always ask the question How did how did you end up being whatever you are?

247
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,745
Speaker 1: that has more importance than whatever.

248
00:15:37,865 --> 00:15:39,290
Speaker 1: I am just an interviewer, right?

249
00:15:39,832 --> 00:15:48,638
Speaker 1: and At least half of the people the situation was basically they were doing normal life They went to school or something.

250
00:15:48,738 --> 00:15:51,589
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they just ended up in a job.

251
00:15:52,251 --> 00:15:56,544
Speaker 1: Right, you know, whatever their first job or something taking on a particular thing.

252
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:58,510
Speaker 1: I mean they just happened.

253
00:15:58,671 --> 00:16:07,703
Speaker 1: It's like your first job and they assigned you to do this thing and then the next time someone needed someone to do that thing They were the guy or the person right.

254
00:16:07,743 --> 00:16:12,289
Speaker 1: that was the expert on that thing And then now they're the globally important expert on the thing.

255
00:16:13,233 --> 00:16:16,970
Speaker 0: I mean to a minor degree that happened to me with the fucking fixed protocol.

256
00:16:17,111 --> 00:16:17,374
Speaker 0: I didn't.

257
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:18,890
Speaker 0: I never thought in my life.

258
00:16:19,051 --> 00:16:28,130
Speaker 1: this is the thing I want to be like the dude about like I listened to an interview with the guy who managed the 9/11 victims compensation fund, right?

259
00:16:28,491 --> 00:16:31,389
Speaker 1: He's like a lawyer and his job is there's a big pile of money.

260
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:37,939
Speaker 1: People are gonna come and make claims for the money because they were hurt in 9/11 and you decide how much money into and do To give it right?

261
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,801
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that's the job It's like.

262
00:16:39,821 --> 00:16:40,066
Speaker 1: he's like.

263
00:16:40,086 --> 00:16:42,478
Speaker 1: yeah There was some other fund and he was like.

264
00:16:42,539 --> 00:16:45,490
Speaker 1: I was just like a lawyer out of law school and I got a sign.

265
00:16:45,590 --> 00:16:49,000
Speaker 1: You know, I ended up just randomly having to manage that fund.

266
00:16:49,080 --> 00:16:56,622
Speaker 1: and now I'm whenever anyone has a big compensation fund to give money Out to victims or sufferers for hurricanes or whatever.

267
00:16:56,942 --> 00:16:57,584
Speaker 1: I'm like, he's like.

268
00:16:57,645 --> 00:16:58,607
Speaker 1: he's Doug the guy.

269
00:16:58,627 --> 00:16:59,370
Speaker 1: I forget his name.

270
00:17:00,531 --> 00:17:05,569
Speaker 0: Well, you know, actually we know a lot of people are the guy of like tiny niche areas of things, right?

271
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:07,261
Speaker 1: I'm say but you know, that's so.

272
00:17:07,321 --> 00:17:12,029
Speaker 1: anyone who's like, you know You hear all kinds of stories how to succeed in life or whatever bullshit, right?

273
00:17:12,491 --> 00:17:15,580
Speaker 1: You know, but and people will say work hard or get lucky or it.

274
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:21,161
Speaker 1: but now the I guess it's sort of like this luck It's some because these are jobs anyone tells you about.

275
00:17:21,221 --> 00:17:22,265
Speaker 0: guidance counselors aren't like.

276
00:17:22,305 --> 00:17:24,656
Speaker 0: hey, this is the thing you could do But it's it's just.

277
00:17:24,717 --> 00:17:31,990
Speaker 1: I think the advice is you know Get in a position where you do a thing and just become the expert on that thing and no one else is doing that thing.

278
00:17:32,071 --> 00:17:32,576
Speaker 1: So now it's you.

279
00:17:33,101 --> 00:17:35,614
Speaker 0: Yep, a Corollary to that.

280
00:17:36,015 --> 00:17:37,683
Speaker 0: if you're in technology pick.

281
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:43,123
Speaker 0: don't pick an ancient technology But pick a technology that's past its prime but still in wide use.

282
00:17:43,444 --> 00:17:45,030
Speaker 0: you will be employable forever.

283
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:59,000
Speaker 1: Right, if you look at like tech forums, you know and you'll see all the technologies people are talking about all the nerds like like rust or Dockers, you know, yeah No, no everyone's doing those things right.

284
00:17:59,301 --> 00:18:02,130
Speaker 1: if you say if you're gonna get expert in Fortran, that's not gonna help you either.

285
00:18:02,411 --> 00:18:18,483
Speaker 1: No, you have to do is you have to look at not the programming languages or the platforms But instead at like, you know protocols or some industry thing that you know modern and in wide use Right with protocol fixed protocol that kind of crowd.

286
00:18:18,503 --> 00:18:21,233
Speaker 1: Those are you know, that's financial specifically But that's just well.

287
00:18:21,253 --> 00:18:24,303
Speaker 0: capital markets account for like a third of all IT spending.

288
00:18:24,364 --> 00:18:39,730
Speaker 0: so but I'm saying in other industries Yeah, like in in I'm in the music industry now, there's like CWR is a thing or you know, what logic signaling like Signaling truth at like yes and no and sending binary quote data in a verifiable way like train signal.

289
00:18:39,730 --> 00:18:48,450
Speaker 1: I'm just saying get a job at a company that does a thing and do the computer stuff there And there's gonna be some protocol that you're gonna have to learn.

290
00:18:48,631 --> 00:18:55,481
Speaker 1: It's like oh, yeah, our systems work on this standard or this, you know Whatever and just become the expert on that thing.

291
00:18:55,521 --> 00:18:57,610
Speaker 0: and then Tracy points out for trend is still a thing.

292
00:18:57,652 --> 00:18:58,028
Speaker 0: Yes, it is.

293
00:18:58,110 --> 00:19:01,310
Speaker 0: I actually know some people who still have a job coding for trend is still a thing.

294
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:16,110
Speaker 1: But it's like if you like city won't become the king of fortress you sit at home like a nerd Learning for trend with your like mainframe emulator or whatever In your house, that's not really gonna get you, you know, some great position.

295
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,696
Speaker 1: You might be able to get a job with it.

296
00:19:17,716 --> 00:19:19,442
Speaker 1: Maybe but it's not like.

297
00:19:19,462 --> 00:19:22,854
Speaker 1: I don't think that's time well spent All right.

298
00:19:22,934 --> 00:19:31,353
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think it's time for things of the day.

299
00:19:31,373 --> 00:19:31,916
Speaker 0: what he got.

300
00:19:31,976 --> 00:19:34,940
Speaker 1: so Nerds we like maps.

301
00:19:35,004 --> 00:19:39,697
Speaker 1: Yeah I Remember you can always tell a good book if you open the book and the book starts with a map.

302
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:43,420
Speaker 1: prince of nothing Lord of the Rings every good book has a map in the front.

303
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:48,783
Speaker 0: I remember the first time we went to Seattle ever for the first packs we ever went to in 2008.

304
00:19:48,783 --> 00:19:53,800
Speaker 0: We saw a map store and I was like, oh and we went in and there's all these stores still there.

305
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:55,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they're all these awesome maps.

306
00:19:55,548 --> 00:20:02,039
Speaker 0: and then the next year we went back and I wanted to run this like burning wheel game about like Napoleonic era ship stuff.

307
00:20:02,622 --> 00:20:03,205
Speaker 0: So I went in.

308
00:20:03,225 --> 00:20:05,213
Speaker 0: I was like do you have any nautical charts?

309
00:20:05,635 --> 00:20:06,759
Speaker 0: and the guy didn't have any.

310
00:20:07,182 --> 00:20:08,170
Speaker 0: Cuz he mostly sells maps to.

311
00:20:08,190 --> 00:20:09,360
Speaker 1: there's a giant map store.

312
00:20:09,592 --> 00:20:11,180
Speaker 0: Yeah But he mostly sells like maps to tourists.

313
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:15,815
Speaker 0: But he got really excited that someone who wanted a weird map came into his store.

314
00:20:15,835 --> 00:20:17,340
Speaker 0: cuz he was clearly a map nerd.

315
00:20:17,561 --> 00:20:18,968
Speaker 1: Yeah, clearly you own a map store.

316
00:20:18,988 --> 00:20:19,550
Speaker 1: You're a map now.

317
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:20,515
Speaker 0: He's living his dream.

318
00:20:20,595 --> 00:20:21,379
Speaker 0: That's his best life.

319
00:20:22,222 --> 00:20:25,935
Speaker 1: Anyway, so, you know make a lot of nerds like to draw maps.

320
00:20:26,397 --> 00:20:34,888
Speaker 1: Yep, but You know, it's not so easy to get maps especially old ancient ones like if you look at like textbooks They'll be like tiny thumbnails.

321
00:20:34,948 --> 00:20:36,295
Speaker 1: Yeah, you go online.

322
00:20:36,316 --> 00:20:37,160
Speaker 1: You have to go to the library.

323
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,428
Speaker 1: You know only the fancy libraries would have some right.

324
00:20:40,969 --> 00:20:45,824
Speaker 1: but here we haven't maybe the best online resource of useful nerdy maps Right.

325
00:20:46,428 --> 00:20:48,600
Speaker 1: It is George the third's military maps.

326
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:57,575
Speaker 1: They uploaded a fuck ton of ultra high resolution scans of old European military maps, you're not gonna find the map I do.

327
00:20:57,595 --> 00:20:58,278
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have to click it.

328
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:03,418
Speaker 1: There you go And they're there for free for you to use.

329
00:21:04,022 --> 00:21:08,220
Speaker 1: No, man for your nerdy things and pretty much I clicked around it randomly.

330
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:17,960
Speaker 1: every single map that I clicked on was Amazing and would be very very useful for any kind of nerdy thing you want to do.

331
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:21,153
Speaker 1: You could pretty much take a map at random and like be like boom.

332
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:22,217
Speaker 1: This is the RPG map.

333
00:21:22,237 --> 00:21:23,422
Speaker 1: Here's the town Here's the fort.

334
00:21:23,462 --> 00:21:26,294
Speaker 1: Here's the right and just go with no planning.

335
00:21:26,354 --> 00:21:27,519
Speaker 1: No thinking no nothing.

336
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,094
Speaker 1: except These are all real maps of real world.

337
00:21:30,174 --> 00:21:31,080
Speaker 1: Mostly real Europe.

338
00:21:31,921 --> 00:21:34,031
Speaker 1: During times of war like hundred-year war what?

339
00:21:34,051 --> 00:21:35,860
Speaker 1: I don't know which wars but 30 years war.

340
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,739
Speaker 1: I think Europe Europe had too many wars for me to remember which ones.

341
00:21:41,441 --> 00:21:45,659
Speaker 1: Definitely, you know not not in our anyone alive's lifetime, right?

342
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:49,552
Speaker 0: So speaking of the world being the part of a catastrophe.

343
00:21:49,572 --> 00:21:51,117
Speaker 0: I saw a tweet going around.

344
00:21:51,137 --> 00:21:51,860
Speaker 0: Am I gonna link to the tweet?

345
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,444
Speaker 0: I'm gonna link to the real website.

346
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:58,878
Speaker 0: But basically this Twitter account was like, oh my god, what's going on in Mali?

347
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:09,979
Speaker 0: Cuz Normal people when they travel on a country think about or know about yep So most people when they travel especially Americans don't think much about where they're going Like they do tourist research and they just go.

348
00:22:10,501 --> 00:22:22,040
Speaker 0: But if you travel for business or you travel a lot or like you've lived in other places around the world Especially for American a really good thing to look at is the United States like Department of State.

349
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:30,654
Speaker 0: basically, like you trust you trust our current State Department, uh They have not messed this stuff up yet as far as I can tell.

350
00:22:31,578 --> 00:22:35,113
Speaker 0: I won't try Depending on how things go over the rest of this year and early next year.

351
00:22:35,133 --> 00:22:36,860
Speaker 0: I may not ever trust this website.

352
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:49,880
Speaker 1: I wonder like if you're say for example Chinese and you go to the Chinese State Department Equivalence website of where that say for a Chinese person with a Chinese passport to go It says for for work purposes at multiple companies.

353
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:56,040
Speaker 1: I've had access to independent research on this kind of travel like you know, but I want I don't want to see the independent truth.

354
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,488
Speaker 1: I want to know what our biases state.

355
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:01,938
Speaker 1: other countries are telling their own citizens about traveling.

356
00:23:01,978 --> 00:23:03,064
Speaker 0: a lot of that It's just public.

357
00:23:03,386 --> 00:23:05,360
Speaker 0: like this stuff is not right, but I can't read Chinese.

358
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:08,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of it's translated even on like Chinese websites.

359
00:23:08,255 --> 00:23:14,560
Speaker 1: Okay, like for real I I don't know what website to go to like what I. I'd even know the name of the equivalent of the State Department in.

360
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:25,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, uh, I've learned a lot of these things mostly because I've used third-party like security firms who have given me information And that information tells me proper nouns to look forward to find even more fun things to read.

361
00:23:26,183 --> 00:23:27,251
Speaker 0: But the tweet was going around.

362
00:23:27,311 --> 00:23:29,139
Speaker 0: it was like, holy shit Don't go to Mali.

363
00:23:29,541 --> 00:23:39,046
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day is I actually want to just link you to this really simple website where you can see for any country on earth, uh, I Don't know if the United States list itself.

364
00:23:39,207 --> 00:23:50,197
Speaker 0: Actually, I've never looked for the United States on its own travel advisories But I do know that other countries List the United States as being a hazard for LGBT people, which yeah.

365
00:23:50,418 --> 00:23:54,760
Speaker 0: Yeah but the US Travel State Department stuff is pretty good.

366
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:57,700
Speaker 0: But the one that people were linking to was Mali and I read these things a lot.

367
00:23:58,122 --> 00:24:05,883
Speaker 0: I've been to countries up to a level two like don't go here warning I have not been to a level three country But I have been.

368
00:24:05,903 --> 00:24:13,911
Speaker 0: I've driven through on one occasion a zone that was designated as a level three Within a level two country and I had to have security with me.

369
00:24:14,693 --> 00:24:16,480
Speaker 0: that was in Brazil a long time ago.

370
00:24:16,620 --> 00:24:19,360
Speaker 0: But anyway, so there aren't many countries on the level four.

371
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:23,860
Speaker 0: But of all those countries in the level four the tweet that was going around was Mali is level four the highest level.

372
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,768
Speaker 1: There's no level five.

373
00:24:25,212 --> 00:24:26,080
Speaker 0: No, there's no level five.

374
00:24:26,181 --> 00:24:27,279
Speaker 0: There are global warnings, too.

375
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:29,089
Speaker 0: But basically level one is we're like whatever.

376
00:24:29,109 --> 00:24:30,939
Speaker 1: well five is like the whole country is on.

377
00:24:31,281 --> 00:24:36,398
Speaker 0: Yeah, level two is like be cautious like here are specific things to worry about.

378
00:24:36,438 --> 00:24:40,739
Speaker 0: a lot of times It'll be like this kind of crime is happening in this area of this country.

379
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:43,428
Speaker 0: Level three is like please don't go here.

380
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:51,956
Speaker 0: level four is basically if you go here and you're an American The US government will not fucking help you if you get into trouble like you're on your own.

381
00:24:51,997 --> 00:24:52,278
Speaker 0: Good luck.

382
00:24:52,298 --> 00:24:52,619
Speaker 0: Have fun.

383
00:24:53,424 --> 00:25:03,416
Speaker 0: but the Mali one this is the longest like warning I've ever seen from a country like longer than the one for like North Korea.

384
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:08,520
Speaker 1: and What's interesting you can you can describe the problem North Korea with very few words.

385
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:10,270
Speaker 1: Yeah, big problem doesn't need a lot of words.

386
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:10,633
Speaker 1: But

387
00:25:10,653 --> 00:25:29,220
Speaker 0: what's interesting is the main value of this site in general is that it gives you Specific advice like don't go to ATMs in this part of this map Like they're very specific Like some of them will even list like here are the scams that are currently active as of a month ago in these regions.

388
00:25:29,765 --> 00:25:37,700
Speaker 0: But the Mali one Item number one draft a will and designate appropriate insurance beneficiaries and powers of attorney.

389
00:25:38,324 --> 00:25:44,100
Speaker 0: Discuss a plan with loved ones regarding care of can custody of children pets property belongings.

390
00:25:44,802 --> 00:25:46,969
Speaker 0: Share important documents with your significant others.

391
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:49,618
Speaker 0: Like it basically says plan to not return why?

392
00:25:51,162 --> 00:25:52,066
Speaker 1: What is the like?

393
00:25:52,387 --> 00:25:54,013
Speaker 1: even if you were like, why would you?

394
00:25:54,394 --> 00:25:55,840
Speaker 1: what's positive about going to Mali?

395
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:57,893
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't know a lot about Mali.

396
00:25:57,933 --> 00:25:58,839
Speaker 1: I don't know anything about Mali.

397
00:26:00,005 --> 00:26:06,353
Speaker 0: I've never seen One of these advisories that in my life that started with draft a will.

398
00:26:06,433 --> 00:26:08,739
Speaker 0: like for real like that is the advice they give you.

399
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,768
Speaker 0: So anyway, did by thinking today.

400
00:26:11,848 --> 00:26:20,126
Speaker 0: the travel advisories thing overall can be some interesting and fascinating reading And I if you're ever gonna travel somewhere I'd recommend looking at this.

401
00:26:20,447 --> 00:26:28,031
Speaker 0: but especially if things don't go so well in the US over the next 12 months Recommend checking a non-us source for this information as well.

402
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:30,840
Speaker 0: And when I say non-us, I also mean non-british.

403
00:26:32,983 --> 00:26:35,860
Speaker 0: So anyway in the meta moment, he knows book club book the tale of Genji.

404
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:40,736
Speaker 0: I'm reading it and steamrolling through it really hard to keep track of who's who other.

405
00:26:40,776 --> 00:26:43,808
Speaker 1: that's why at the start of every chapter It says he has all the people in this chapter.

406
00:26:44,069 --> 00:26:46,399
Speaker 0: I flip back to that section a lot.

407
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:52,649
Speaker 0: I'm glad But I know Genji is.

408
00:26:52,669 --> 00:26:54,039
Speaker 0: I know when they're talking about Genji.

409
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,025
Speaker 0: Okay, good job.

410
00:26:56,146 --> 00:26:57,152
Speaker 0: But yeah, we're reading the tale again.

411
00:26:57,172 --> 00:27:03,624
Speaker 0: G at some point next month or two We're gonna do a checkpoint and we're gonna talk about some chunk of the tale of Genji Cuz.

412
00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:04,812
Speaker 0: there's a lot to say about it.

413
00:27:05,315 --> 00:27:10,276
Speaker 0: There's a. There's some awesome characters and so far Genji is like way near the bottom of characters.

414
00:27:10,336 --> 00:27:11,220
Speaker 0: I actually care about.

415
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:13,949
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah packs East is actually super soon.

416
00:27:14,030 --> 00:27:14,511
Speaker 0: Oh god.

417
00:27:14,571 --> 00:27:17,040
Speaker 1: Yeah early this year and we got a panel there.

418
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,328
Speaker 1: I think it's not a clickbait garbage panel.

419
00:27:19,348 --> 00:27:22,440
Speaker 1: So maybe you could come to it or maybe you can just watch it on YouTube.

420
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:26,460
Speaker 0: Yep, we were slightly updating it, but it's basically the same panel.

421
00:27:26,861 --> 00:27:30,135
Speaker 0: Take your fucking turn like go fast play games pop up up go go go.

422
00:27:30,316 --> 00:27:33,630
Speaker 1: We did it a pack some plug But we'll do it at East but we'll tell us the different jokes.

423
00:27:33,731 --> 00:27:34,072
Speaker 0: I changed.

424
00:27:34,153 --> 00:27:36,638
Speaker 1: we got a badge, you know You can say hi to us.

425
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:45,849
Speaker 0: Well, we get a free badge anyway Because we're also enforcers and I encourage you if you like penny arcade expose as a whole I'd recommend at least once in your life.

426
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:50,417
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter which packs just pick a packs and Sign up to be an enforcer.

427
00:27:50,437 --> 00:27:55,180
Speaker 1: to be this I mean if you go to a lot of paxes then you you know, why not enforce at one of them?

428
00:27:55,360 --> 00:28:02,263
Speaker 1: But if you don't go to a lot of paxes if you go rarely don't waste like 30% of your packs Yeah, enforcing.

429
00:28:02,283 --> 00:28:02,384
Speaker 1: but

430
00:28:02,404 --> 00:28:16,680
Speaker 0: if you go to mold a lot of paxes enforce at least once because one it if you enjoy pax that is how you can make more pax experiences happen for more people and Enforcers are a big part of the reason why pax doesn't suck like most other conventions.

431
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:18,407
Speaker 1: Also there have less and less enforcers.

432
00:28:18,447 --> 00:28:19,170
Speaker 1: They need more.

433
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,078
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're always looking for more.

434
00:28:21,238 --> 00:28:25,197
Speaker 1: right now It's not like they don't have a. they don't have more people asking than they need.

435
00:28:25,257 --> 00:28:25,820
Speaker 1: They need more.

436
00:28:25,965 --> 00:28:33,380
Speaker 0: Yep But to even if you're just a selfish dick as long as you're not a jerk while you're enforcing and you're like a good person.

437
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:46,120
Speaker 0: Otherwise if you enforce you'll see a whole other side of the show and that is like worth the price of admission by itself Just to see what a giant convention like packs looks like from behind the scenes like from a logistic standpoint.

438
00:28:46,201 --> 00:28:50,025
Speaker 0: Like that is an interesting experience And we will be there.

439
00:28:50,085 --> 00:28:50,869
Speaker 0: We'll be enforcing.

440
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,960
Speaker 0: most of our friends will be enforcing at paxes.

441
00:28:53,141 --> 00:28:55,550
Speaker 0: That's the one that we all took up the black for.

442
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:59,850
Speaker 0: I guess this took up the red because they color-coded it after those Early, no longer the black anywhere.

443
00:28:59,971 --> 00:29:00,192
Speaker 0: Nope.

444
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:02,383
Speaker 1: I Remember when it was the black.

445
00:29:02,664 --> 00:29:04,690
Speaker 0: only gray muzzles call it taking up the black.

446
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,435
Speaker 0: that was packs West.

447
00:29:06,596 --> 00:29:11,713
Speaker 0: like earliest days like 2007 might have been the last black year.

448
00:29:11,734 --> 00:29:15,505
Speaker 0: Yep otherwise Follow us on YouTube.

452
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:30,971
Speaker 0: We have Rev Massively stepped up the moderation of the geek nights forum and a lot of people have not been posting anymore Meaning a lot of you might be more inclined to post.

453
00:29:31,232 --> 00:29:33,140
Speaker 1: Well, you know, this is just like the first step.

454
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:40,252
Speaker 1: I think we still have some ideas about how to Greatly reshape like the why the forum is even there.

455
00:29:40,332 --> 00:29:44,002
Speaker 1: It's like, you know when there are so many other communication Platforms.

456
00:29:44,062 --> 00:29:50,007
Speaker 0: this includes the fact that our way and elsewhere our website is a very 2005 looking ass website right now.

457
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:53,780
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, right this reeks of when dig was popular.

458
00:29:54,041 --> 00:29:58,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at least for the short term, it's like, you know, listen, you know arguments in a forum.

459
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,580
Speaker 1: That's what a forum is sort of for no matter what even if you say it's not for that.

460
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:03,587
Speaker 1: That's why I have it.

462
00:30:06,061 --> 00:30:10,660
Speaker 1: But you know, we're just like listen we saw certain arguments, right?

463
00:30:10,801 --> 00:30:14,760
Speaker 1: It's like we don't want people to not have them but it's like do you really need to have them here?

464
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:15,928
Speaker 1: You can have them on reddit.

Speaker 1: It's like way back.

467
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:21,520
Speaker 1: I think we've been through this before the first time we've heard the same thing, right?

468
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:23,934
Speaker 0: It's like come on people bunch of people can argue about religion.

469
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:28,697
Speaker 0: We're just like look listen No one's ever allowed to argue about this again, unless you disprove the flies.

Speaker 0: Isn't back fest right now?

497
00:31:32,101 --> 00:31:37,197

00:31:37,217 --> 00:31:41,699
Speaker 0: guy play a lot Of tabletop games there, but I'm gonna have to skip thank icon this year.

499
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:46,280

500
00:31:46,541 --> 00:31:55,951
Speaker 0: But I will return the following year and I'm also highly likely even if Scott doesn't going to return To kinetic on and do a bunch of panels have fun.

501
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:56,854
Speaker 0: I will have fun.

502
00:31:56,874 --> 00:31:59,972
Speaker 0: Okay, it'll be a good time All right.

503
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:01,539
Speaker 0: Getting rid of shit?

504
00:32:02,194 --> 00:32:02,480
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

505
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:05,572
Speaker 1: So we did a show about moving somewhat recently.

506
00:32:05,914 --> 00:32:16,858
Speaker 1: as far as Thursday shows go at least Yeah, and one aspect of moving we may have talked about during that episode It's not exclusive to moving but it usually coincides with moving is getting rid of the shit.

507
00:32:16,878 --> 00:32:22,779
Speaker 0: You don't want Yep, right and this was not a concern for most of my life for a bunch of reasons.

508
00:32:22,939 --> 00:32:28,260
Speaker 0: one Lived in like Midwestern suburbs where everyone had like a garage in a basement at first.

509
00:32:28,441 --> 00:32:33,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, I had like a house and I didn't have a lot of money to buy a lot of stuff And also I didn't own the house.

510
00:32:33,981 --> 00:32:38,974
Speaker 0: my parents did right and My parents had this problem and it's not like I would be aware of that.

511
00:32:39,014 --> 00:32:44,660
Speaker 0: like as a kid is just like go down to The basement like I didn't like there'd be a room full of shit and I just didn't ever go into that room.

512
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,240
Speaker 1: I didn't know I didn't care that it was attic was full of shit.

513
00:32:47,301 --> 00:32:51,320
Speaker 1: I kind of wanted to go in the attic to look through all the shit I only cared was like my shit.

514
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,709
Speaker 1: So I didn't care at one point.

515
00:32:52,749 --> 00:32:58,680
Speaker 0: like we had a pool table and the shit Like encroached into the area of the pool table and if God made heart made it hard to play pool.

516
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:04,320
Speaker 0: Then I cared a little bit and I like tried to get right tried to push all the shit back into the shit area.

517
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,346
Speaker 1: Right, you know.

518
00:33:05,366 --> 00:33:06,010
Speaker 1: and then we move.

519
00:33:06,110 --> 00:33:07,076
Speaker 1: even when we were in Beacon.

520
00:33:07,136 --> 00:33:12,500
Speaker 1: It's like, okay We had a house that was way too big and we could fit tons and tons of stuff in there.

521
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,812
Speaker 0: We didn't own anything cuz we were in college for five years.

522
00:33:14,912 --> 00:33:16,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, we didn't have a lot of stuff.

523
00:33:16,822 --> 00:33:18,008
Speaker 0: We went out and bought a bunch of stuff.

524
00:33:18,028 --> 00:33:19,977
Speaker 0: I think we've thrown away most of that stuff by this point.

525
00:33:20,077 --> 00:33:23,791
Speaker 0: Yeah We saw that table though, oh god damn it.

526
00:33:23,831 --> 00:33:24,855
Speaker 0: does anyone want that table?

527
00:33:25,176 --> 00:33:26,260
Speaker 1: anyone want a kitchen table?

528
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:26,822
Speaker 1: Does anyone?

529
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:29,229
Speaker 0: are really nice wooden kitchen taste.

530
00:33:29,250 --> 00:33:32,480
Speaker 1: not super nice, but it is a solid kitchen table before chair.

531
00:33:32,580 --> 00:33:35,135
Speaker 0: It's real wood like nicely finished.

532
00:33:35,196 --> 00:33:36,605
Speaker 1: It's like $500 like 15 years ago.

533
00:33:36,685 --> 00:33:40,490
Speaker 0: Yeah It's a really nice table.

534
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:44,628
Speaker 1: It's a table anyway You know, it's not damaged really at all.

535
00:33:44,989 --> 00:33:47,600
Speaker 0: Okay, so I just pulled up a bunch of pictures of us moving out of Beacon.

536
00:33:47,901 --> 00:33:52,040
Speaker 1: Right, but point is when we moved right suddenly it's like I got all this shit.

537
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:54,259
Speaker 1: I want to get rid of this shit because I don't have a lot of room.

538
00:33:54,380 --> 00:33:56,192
Speaker 1: I don't have a lot of space in the city.

539
00:33:56,213 --> 00:33:57,260
Speaker 1: I want to get rid of stuff, right?

540
00:33:57,363 --> 00:34:05,310
Speaker 1: Yeah And even if you're don't have even if you have tons of room having less stuff makes life easier Because you can get up and go.

541
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:13,639
Speaker 1: it's like the stuff even if you're not Literally carrying it like in your bag is like a burden on your ability to like be mobile.

542
00:34:13,739 --> 00:34:22,699
Speaker 1: I can't suddenly like move to another state or go away for a long time You know because it's like I had to deal with all my stuff.

543
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,920
Speaker 1: I had to pay rent on the place where the stuff is.

544
00:34:25,020 --> 00:34:32,339
Speaker 1: Even if I'm going like I want to take a trip for like several months Yeah I'm burdened by having to pay rent on this place with a bunch of stuff in it.

545
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,021
Speaker 0: No If I or

546
00:34:33,061 --> 00:34:35,068
Speaker 1: move everything into storage and move it back

547
00:34:35,309 --> 00:34:41,193
Speaker 0: out now if I owned a house and just was living there like semi permanently, I wouldn't think about this nearly as much because

548
00:34:41,775 --> 00:34:42,098
Speaker 1: there is

549
00:34:42,197 --> 00:34:51,918
Speaker 0: a Value to be had in accumulating stuff that is not negatively impacting your life because that stuff is valuable and useful if it ever comes up and otherwise doesn't negatively impact you.

550
00:34:51,998 --> 00:34:56,190
Speaker 0: like You got some old skis you have a kid You can just give the kid the old skis.

551
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:58,019
Speaker 0: like save yourself some money like that kind of thing.

552
00:34:58,682 --> 00:35:02,000
Speaker 0: But I've never been that way like even when I was in high school.

553
00:35:02,081 --> 00:35:10,980
Speaker 0: Like I pretty much always assumed I wouldn't be living in the US at some point Like I'd always kind of planned to like move around live somewhere else see the world like fuck living in a house forever.

554
00:35:12,061 --> 00:35:22,144
Speaker 0: So I've always had this idea that I wanted to have less stuff, but it didn't really become necessary to deal with immediately until now when I do.

555
00:35:22,184 --> 00:35:36,562
Speaker 0: now I have like three closets in this entire apartment and even now I've been getting rid of shit at a like terrifying rate and Every time I do this every time I think I'm going to take this one area of my apartment and get rid of everything I don't need.

556
00:35:37,065 --> 00:35:40,120
Speaker 0: I generate like 12 garbage bags worth of shit.

557
00:35:40,622 --> 00:35:42,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't know how it's like.

558
00:35:42,289 --> 00:35:44,760
Speaker 1: I managed to get rid of most of my shit, right?

559
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:53,640
Speaker 1: Now the prop thing is a. if you live in like a town and I guess a good town You can get rid of your shit pretty easily because you probably have a car, right?

560
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:56,126
Speaker 1: You can use the car put shit in it.

561
00:35:56,427 --> 00:36:02,726
Speaker 0: Maria posted on like Craigslist and someone else who also owns a car will like Drive to your house and pick it up.

562
00:36:03,008 --> 00:36:06,380
Speaker 1: Well, actually Craigslist isn't so great these days of all things.

563
00:36:06,923 --> 00:36:09,300
Speaker 0: Oh, I've never successfully given something away on Craigslist.

564
00:36:09,882 --> 00:36:11,488
Speaker 0: I gave up because I tried.

565
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:22,660
Speaker 0: I tried a whole bunch of people would respond asking questions so stupid that I refused to talk to them or Demanding ridiculous nonsense of me for the privilege of taking my shit that they wanted.

566
00:36:23,206 --> 00:36:30,340
Speaker 1: I have given some way in Craigslist But more recently the thing that I've had the most success with is actually Facebook marketplace.

567
00:36:31,361 --> 00:36:33,492
Speaker 1: Only good thing that Facebook has ever made.

568
00:36:33,512 --> 00:36:34,980
Speaker 1: that's like actually good.

569
00:36:35,481 --> 00:36:37,569
Speaker 1: It's like a better Craigslist than Craigslist.

570
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:40,720
Speaker 1: It totally works at least especially in New York City where there's a lot of people on it.

571
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:43,791
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you give shit away and like even obscure shit.

572
00:36:43,831 --> 00:36:44,614
Speaker 1: I tried to give away.

573
00:36:44,695 --> 00:36:45,779
Speaker 1: people came and took it.

574
00:36:47,771 --> 00:36:49,284
Speaker 1: so I Would make like.

575
00:36:49,324 --> 00:36:53,480
Speaker 1: if you don't like Facebook, I would make like a bullshit Facebook account and only use Facebook marketplace.

576
00:36:53,861 --> 00:36:58,499
Speaker 0: Yep, but I guess the tricky part is I've gotten rid of all the things that are easy to get rid of without a car.

577
00:36:59,422 --> 00:37:03,053
Speaker 0: What I have left are things that I'm sure human will.

578
00:37:03,073 --> 00:37:14,620
Speaker 0: on one hand there are things that I'm sure human could use But it's hard to find that human and my options are either Throw the thing away or put feels bad or put a lot of effort into it feels bad.

579
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:21,977
Speaker 1: Yeah, it feels bad to throw something out that you don't want, you know You're never gonna use again, but it's still perfectly good.

580
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:27,198
Speaker 0: Yep Like I have a whole bunch of high school textbooks that are still pretty good and you think I want to donate this.

581
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:31,691
Speaker 1: but actually donating things is sometimes easy and sometimes difficult.

582
00:37:31,711 --> 00:37:32,453
Speaker 1: and what any?

583
00:37:32,493 --> 00:37:36,765
Speaker 1: and the thing is the easiest places to donate are Places you don't want to.

584
00:37:36,805 --> 00:37:38,793
Speaker 0: don't never give things to Salvation Army.

585
00:37:38,814 --> 00:37:39,476
Speaker 0: They're a hate group.

586
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:40,220
Speaker 1: No, that's the worst.

587
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,163
Speaker 1: Yeah, like never.

588
00:37:41,444 --> 00:37:46,240
Speaker 1: also I'd rather burn something than let the Salvation Army go like a gas station and there's like a big metal thing.

589
00:37:46,280 --> 00:37:48,220
Speaker 1: That's like, you know donate stuff here.

590
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,269
Speaker 0: Oh, I remember when we found out those are scams.

591
00:37:50,410 --> 00:37:52,620
Speaker 1: if you look at if you actually research it.

592
00:37:52,861 --> 00:37:56,623
Speaker 1: There are maybe some that don't suck but the vast majority of them I've researched.

593
00:37:56,743 --> 00:37:59,653
Speaker 1: like huh who actually owns that big metal can.

594
00:37:59,914 --> 00:38:01,680
Speaker 1: where will the stuff go that I put in there?

595
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:02,666
Speaker 1: What will happen to it?

596
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:03,412
Speaker 1: who?

597
00:38:03,432 --> 00:38:04,480
Speaker 1: I there was one.

598
00:38:04,723 --> 00:38:18,260
Speaker 1: It was literally a cult Like not a cult in the same the way that I throw the word cult around to describe things even like Scientology Which also is a cult but like no the kind of cult that is like the Kool-Aid kind of cult.

599
00:38:18,421 --> 00:38:23,490
Speaker 1: Yeah, super like, you know the kind of cult like that XX whatever that was upstaying.

600
00:38:23,571 --> 00:38:23,751
Speaker 1: like.

601
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:31,075
Speaker 1: that kind of cult was making money off the Donated clothes somehow and if you put clothes in there, you're helping them and it's great.

602
00:38:31,136 --> 00:38:32,320
Speaker 1: I'll do not put clothes in there.

603
00:38:33,962 --> 00:38:35,690
Speaker 0: I also have a lot of like.

604
00:38:35,710 --> 00:38:39,062
Speaker 0: the thing that's hardest to get rid of in New York is Furniture.

605
00:38:39,465 --> 00:38:44,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz I can't type furniture Can't easily be moved without disintegrating.

606
00:38:44,401 --> 00:38:49,700
Speaker 1: I mean you can theoretically put stuff out on for the sanitation and but they'll throw it but they'll trash it.

607
00:38:49,821 --> 00:38:51,433
Speaker 1: I've seen furniture out there.

608
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:52,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they'll trash it.

609
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,410
Speaker 0: I can't just take it all down and they'll just trash it.

610
00:38:54,852 --> 00:38:56,440
Speaker 0: but I have like an armoire.

611
00:38:56,521 --> 00:38:57,487
Speaker 0: It's a big armoire.

612
00:38:57,507 --> 00:38:58,131
Speaker 0: I want to get rid of.

613
00:38:58,232 --> 00:38:58,756
Speaker 0: it's nice.

614
00:38:58,796 --> 00:38:59,420
Speaker 0: It's made out of wood.

615
00:38:59,501 --> 00:39:02,540
Speaker 0: It's kind of beat up but like it's perfectly functional.

616
00:39:02,822 --> 00:39:05,520
Speaker 0: I can imagine a poor family like wanting this in their house.

617
00:39:05,961 --> 00:39:14,827
Speaker 0: But I would have to pay actually a lot for the privilege of someone of someone to come and pick it up and take it Independent of who I donated to.

618
00:39:14,887 --> 00:39:18,260
Speaker 1: yeah, it's very annoying that it's like I don't have to schedule it during working hours.

619
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:27,194
Speaker 0: I have to like take a day off work sit here wait for this truck to show up that trucks gonna have to somehow like Park illegally on Crescent Street and then take this thing.

620
00:39:27,214 --> 00:39:27,656
Speaker 1: Yep.

621
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:37,644
Speaker 1: Yep Crescent Street FYI is like the Street that goes to one of the most important bridges to Manhattan used to be able to park on the street in the back But that those days are over.

622
00:39:37,684 --> 00:39:39,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, they put a building there.

623
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:40,817
Speaker 1: Yeah by parking lot.

624
00:39:41,419 --> 00:39:44,229
Speaker 0: Yeah So I'm probably gonna just like.

625
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:55,300
Speaker 0: I'm getting to the point to where there's a bunch of things that I've been wanting to donate or give away for a while and Have been foiled enough to where I might just throw them away and just wash my hands.

626
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:57,960
Speaker 1: It's so annoying that we can't have this like arbitrage.

627
00:39:58,081 --> 00:40:05,060
Speaker 1: there are people who basically have no money and Would really need stuff and there's no who have stuff and desperately want to get rid of it.

628
00:40:05,341 --> 00:40:11,080
Speaker 1: But the logistics of getting the stuff from the person who doesn't want it to the person who could use it are so difficult.

629
00:40:11,221 --> 00:40:11,985
Speaker 1: It's like you had to pay.

630
00:40:12,005 --> 00:40:13,975
Speaker 1: it's like I had to pay to get rid of it.

631
00:40:14,176 --> 00:40:16,286
Speaker 1: for that amount of money I could buy two new ones.

632
00:40:16,507 --> 00:40:16,728
Speaker 0: Yep.

633
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:18,515
Speaker 0: The hardest one is technology.

634
00:40:18,536 --> 00:40:22,789
Speaker 0: I had So many computer monitors that all worked.

635
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:28,873
Speaker 0: every one of them worked, but they were so obsolete that they were worthless Like no one wanted them.

636
00:40:28,933 --> 00:40:29,939
Speaker 0: schools didn't want them.

637
00:40:30,381 --> 00:40:33,832
Speaker 1: Recycling centers didn't want is a big problem these days with pianos.

638
00:40:33,852 --> 00:40:42,490
Speaker 1: a lot of people have pianos From old in the day or whoever whatever and You can't get rid of a piano because no one wants one.

639
00:40:42,510 --> 00:40:43,555
Speaker 1: you like donate to a school.

640
00:40:43,595 --> 00:40:44,860
Speaker 1: the school's like we already got piano.

641
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:53,011
Speaker 0: Yeah, most schools have digital pianos now because digital pianos sound 90% the same like it doesn't matter for most use cases of a piano.

642
00:40:53,413 --> 00:40:58,520
Speaker 0: They have more tools for like instruction They're easier for schools to use and they don't need tutors.

643
00:40:58,661 --> 00:41:01,916
Speaker 1: I'm just saying real pianos the schools will have even if they don't have digital ones.

644
00:41:01,976 --> 00:41:02,760
Speaker 1: They already have.

645
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:07,380
Speaker 0: They have all the real one right but a real piano is too much of a pain in the ass to maintain.

646
00:41:07,621 --> 00:41:09,308
Speaker 1: It's really like you'll have this piano.

647
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:13,929
Speaker 1: you think oh, it's a very valuable expensive thing But it's like a diamond ring, right?

648
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:14,371
Speaker 1: But good.

649
00:41:14,432 --> 00:41:16,160
Speaker 1: Well diamond rings not actually valuable.

650
00:41:16,201 --> 00:41:22,000
Speaker 1: Well that you think it's valuable But it really is like the piano sort of is like if that same piano was in a piano store.

651
00:41:22,362 --> 00:41:25,220
Speaker 1: Someone might actually come in and buy it for a large amount of money.

652
00:41:25,582 --> 00:41:31,892
Speaker 1: But if you have the piano and are trying to sell it You will basically have to pay that amount of money to get rid of it.

653
00:41:31,912 --> 00:41:36,328
Speaker 0: Pro tip if you need a piano or a Diamond ring buy one on the secondary market.

654
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:37,413
Speaker 0: You can get it for almost nothing.

655
00:41:37,573 --> 00:41:44,939
Speaker 0: almost nothing ain't worth nothing Yep, but these computer monitors The only thing that saved me was that Scott had a computer like your monitor died.

656
00:41:45,583 --> 00:41:46,830
Speaker 0: So I have.

657
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,580
Speaker 0: so I gave Scott one of the monitors.

658
00:41:48,861 --> 00:41:55,072
Speaker 0: I put the other monitor in the living room as a monitor like around the corner like in the kitchen so I can watch stuff while I'm working on things.

659
00:41:55,678 --> 00:42:01,840
Speaker 0: and That Samsung the last the sink master I have ended up just taking that to an electronics recycler.

660
00:42:01,961 --> 00:42:03,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one wanted it.

661
00:42:03,941 --> 00:42:07,012
Speaker 0: It's like once a year and they charged me 20 bucks to take it.

662
00:42:07,232 --> 00:42:11,727
Speaker 1: in New York City the center of the world They have these safe disposal of old I.

663
00:42:12,048 --> 00:42:13,412
Speaker 0: I biked over there the last time.

666
00:42:22,543 --> 00:42:26,520
Speaker 1: And well, it's in different places but it's only in each of the places one day a year.

667
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,740
Speaker 1: I think there's only like five days of the year total.

668
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,565
Speaker 1: Yeah And you can go there.

669
00:42:30,605 --> 00:42:31,729
Speaker 0: gotta be a New York City resident.

670
00:42:31,769 --> 00:42:35,144

00:42:51,429 --> 00:42:54,819
Speaker 1: Come on down literally like any of that dangerous shit.

681
00:42:54,879 --> 00:42:57,338
Speaker 1: paint You know, whatever you got.

682
00:42:57,722 --> 00:42:59,276
Speaker 1: electronics, you know.

683
00:42:59,296 --> 00:43:02,408
Speaker 1: and Crazy light bulbs mystery chemical.

684
00:43:02,468 --> 00:43:11,460
Speaker 0: if you bring it they will deal with it because the city would rather Like take on the burden of dealing with it in a safe way and you dump it down the drain.

685
00:43:11,721 --> 00:43:15,340
Speaker 0: Yep, cuz if they didn't have this people would just dump it down the drain, right?

686
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:17,248
Speaker 1: You know some air conditioner or something any.

687
00:43:17,288 --> 00:43:23,940
Speaker 1: you bring it to the safe disposal event Right, and they will take care of it for zero dollar.

688
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,618
Speaker 1: But this event only happens one day only within your at least within your neighborhood one day a year.

689
00:43:29,698 --> 00:43:35,946
Speaker 1: if you drive There's a line of cars and they slowly go around Getting dropping off this stuff one at a time.

690
00:43:35,966 --> 00:43:40,227
Speaker 1: you walk you can walk right in but you got a carrier shit if you're walking And if you don't.

691
00:43:40,348 --> 00:43:41,939
Speaker 1: I used to live a lot closer to the park.

692
00:43:41,979 --> 00:43:49,188
Speaker 1: now I live a few blocks further, but that makes a significant difference in how much stuff I can bring You know without like a hand truck or something.

693
00:43:49,649 --> 00:43:52,900
Speaker 0: Oh, so I didn't realize this cuz I've never tried to throw one of these things away.

694
00:43:53,221 --> 00:43:55,088
Speaker 0: There are three things they will not take.

695
00:43:55,168 --> 00:43:55,951
Speaker 1: What will they not take?

696
00:43:56,051 --> 00:43:56,733
Speaker 0: appliances?

697
00:43:57,175 --> 00:44:00,446
Speaker 0: Okay, like you can't take a microwave Okay, air conditioner.

698
00:44:00,486 --> 00:44:01,690
Speaker 1: You could take air conditioner.

699
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:04,017
Speaker 0: Uh, you keep odd so you can take nope.

700
00:44:04,078 --> 00:44:06,746
Speaker 0: No air conditioners All right, dehumidifiers refrigerators.

701
00:44:06,987 --> 00:44:11,320
Speaker 0: Okay, you can take Freon and things with Freon in them, but you can't take appliances that are Freon.

702
00:44:11,561 --> 00:44:13,187
Speaker 0: Okay, and you can't take tires.

703
00:44:13,568 --> 00:44:14,592
Speaker 1: Oh tires, of course, right?

704
00:44:14,672 --> 00:44:15,696
Speaker 0: Those are the good luck.

705
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:19,329
Speaker 1: getting rid of a tire Get rid of tires is not easy.

706
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:23,535
Speaker 1: Yeah your best bet if you have tires is You know you think all.

707
00:44:23,556 --> 00:44:23,899
Speaker 1: just you know.

708
00:44:24,281 --> 00:44:27,392
Speaker 1: When you buy the tires make sure the tire place takes the old tires.

709
00:44:27,432 --> 00:44:30,544
Speaker 0: now if you have a fridge if you call three one One they'll make an appointment.

710
00:44:30,564 --> 00:44:31,368
Speaker 0: Just come take it from you.

711
00:44:31,569 --> 00:44:34,260
Speaker 1: Yes fridges are like there's a special thing for fridges.

712
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:42,740
Speaker 1: I've seen fridges on like the side of the road when they usually have a sticker on them Like the doors have been torn off and I'm like there's a special way to throw out a fridge in the city.

713
00:44:42,760 --> 00:44:44,820
Speaker 0: So I I'm not sure if this is true.

714
00:44:44,820 --> 00:44:52,807
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna look it up But I'm pretty sure the only reason we have to take the doors off is because of a false scare that kids were hiding in Fridges and I don't know.

715
00:44:52,887 --> 00:44:54,759
Speaker 1: but I've seen that some several times.

716
00:44:55,141 --> 00:44:57,240
Speaker 0: But I don't think that actually happened that often.

717
00:44:57,280 --> 00:44:58,506
Speaker 1: I don't think so either but I'm just saying.

718
00:44:58,546 --> 00:45:04,430
Speaker 1: I've seen several instances of a fridge on the street Be waiting to be thrown out next to the trash with hope.

719
00:45:04,470 --> 00:45:07,199

00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:21,757
Speaker 1: I got some ammonia and I throw that out.

724
00:45:24,401 --> 00:45:32,496
Speaker 0: So the other thing I gotta get rid of and I think I'm just gonna have to throw it away is I have the thing And someone actually had Tracy just mentioned here - uh, you and I both have this.

725
00:45:33,058 --> 00:45:33,640
Speaker 0: we're nerds.

726
00:45:34,161 --> 00:45:35,305
Speaker 0: We have a lot of technology.

727
00:45:35,325 --> 00:45:40,680
Speaker 0: I have at least one of every possible fucking cable I could ever need for anything.

728
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:48,100
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I've got several of the every possible cable you could need for everything and you know what as on one hand Yeah, I could get rid of 90% of these right?

729
00:45:48,402 --> 00:45:52,003
Speaker 0: No when I moved into this fucking apartment in 2009 I got FiOS.

730
00:45:52,324 --> 00:46:04,600
Speaker 0: the only way to get the FiOS to the center of the apartment the computer room was with coax and But Verizon guy didn't have any coax and sure enough I had a coax cable in my bucket of cables.

731
00:46:04,782 --> 00:46:06,279
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I was able to just plug it in.

732
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,472
Speaker 1: I recently when I moved I went through the cables and I got rid of many.

733
00:46:09,894 --> 00:46:11,500
Speaker 1: but there are certain cables, right?

734
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,584
Speaker 1: It's like VGA cable.

735
00:46:12,665 --> 00:46:13,368
Speaker 1: I still got one.

736
00:46:13,649 --> 00:46:14,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know what I got to.

737
00:46:14,995 --> 00:46:15,517
Speaker 1: I had to.

738
00:46:15,598 --> 00:46:16,160
Speaker 0: I got rid of one.

739
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:19,351
Speaker 0: You know, I got rid of all my DVI cables anything with DVI.

740
00:46:19,411 --> 00:46:21,056
Speaker 1: I have one DVI cable.

741
00:46:21,337 --> 00:46:22,100
Speaker 0: I took the plunge.

742
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:22,863
Speaker 0: I went to zero.

743
00:46:23,044 --> 00:46:26,640
Speaker 0: Okay, and I think I'm gonna get rid all my VGA cables.

744
00:46:26,781 --> 00:46:28,499
Speaker 1: I have one VGA and one DVI cable.

745
00:46:28,761 --> 00:46:31,732
Speaker 0: I'm gonna get rid of my VGA long as the monitor still has an input.

746
00:46:31,812 --> 00:46:35,924
Speaker 0: I still got the cable, but I have HDMI to HDMI.

747
00:46:36,044 --> 00:46:38,270
Speaker 0: I have HDMI to micro HDMI.

748
00:46:38,290 --> 00:46:38,832
Speaker 1: I have this.

749
00:46:38,992 --> 00:46:39,614
Speaker 1: I have different.

750
00:46:40,255 --> 00:46:47,220
Speaker 1: I have two different small HDM eyes One that oh, yeah the small one and then the smaller one, right?

751
00:46:47,421 --> 00:46:48,768
Speaker 0: I have I have all of those.

752
00:46:48,828 --> 00:46:58,092
Speaker 1: and then what happened is is newer devices Started like my camera used to have this weird mini or micro HDMI But then the newer camera just has full-size HDMI.

753
00:46:58,172 --> 00:47:00,299
Speaker 0: all of all my cameras have regular as HDMI.

754
00:47:00,339 --> 00:47:01,624
Speaker 1: now They're just like yeah, fuck it.

755
00:47:01,885 --> 00:47:05,440
Speaker 0: So I might just get rid of all my non regular HDMI.

756
00:47:05,861 --> 00:47:07,728
Speaker 1: You know, it's like I have power cables.

757
00:47:07,788 --> 00:47:08,892
Speaker 1: never give her a power cable.

758
00:47:09,153 --> 00:47:11,200
Speaker 0: I did because I actually did an inventory.

759
00:47:11,885 --> 00:47:17,719
Speaker 0: I want you to guess how many Standard like PC like the three that goes into a power supply.

760
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:21,938
Speaker 0: How many of those you think I had in this apartment as of a month ago?

761
00:47:21,938 --> 00:47:25,943
Speaker 1: 20? 31.

762
00:47:25,943 --> 00:47:26,908
Speaker 1: Okay, that's too many.

763
00:47:27,109 --> 00:47:28,776
Speaker 0: I got rid of all but I have six.

764
00:47:28,917 --> 00:47:29,539
Speaker 1: I have like ten.

765
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,446
Speaker 1: I got just guessing.

766
00:47:31,567 --> 00:47:34,437
Speaker 0: I kept six plus the ones that are plugged into devices.

767
00:47:34,457 --> 00:47:35,179
Speaker 0: I'm using right now.

768
00:47:35,506 --> 00:47:38,610
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah The reason I had so many the mixer used one of those.

769
00:47:38,830 --> 00:47:40,275
Speaker 0: they'll compress all that audio shit.

770
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:41,580
Speaker 0: also use that same form factor.

771
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:46,887
Speaker 1: The kind that I don't get rid of are the kind that are like two circles or a circle square with.

772
00:47:47,028 --> 00:47:51,172
Speaker 0: I started get rid of those because I had Maybe tied a lot of them.

773
00:47:51,575 --> 00:47:52,160
Speaker 0: So you know what I did.

774
00:47:52,201 --> 00:48:11,104
Speaker 0: I got rid of all the ones that were Chinese bootlegs from when I bought Chinese bootleg batteries and they came with chargers and you can tell because the the that Specific kind of bootleg the prongs to plug into the outlet will be smooth with no indentations and no holes And they'll both be the same size 99% of the time.

775
00:48:11,145 --> 00:48:12,930
Speaker 0: that is a like bootleg piece of crap cable.

776
00:48:12,950 --> 00:48:13,392
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

777
00:48:14,274 --> 00:48:15,920
Speaker 1: Why are there holes on the prongs of them?

778
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,660
Speaker 0: Partly to save metal and partly because depending on the outlet it helps hold it in better.

779
00:48:20,931 --> 00:48:23,249
Speaker 0: No These days is pretty much just a mark of quality.

780
00:48:23,289 --> 00:48:26,643
Speaker 0: like do people still make them the way they used to or they just make Some cheap shit.

781
00:48:27,005 --> 00:48:27,146
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

782
00:48:27,628 --> 00:48:29,900
Speaker 1: But yeah, I don't think what matters electricity.

783
00:48:30,722 --> 00:48:30,923
Speaker 0: I can.

784
00:48:30,943 --> 00:48:32,976
Speaker 0: I will look up to make sure there isn't something I'm missing here.

785
00:48:33,197 --> 00:48:37,380
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, but yeah, the point is you want to get rid of shit.

786
00:48:37,460 --> 00:48:38,848
Speaker 1: It's like you can call your friends.

787
00:48:38,928 --> 00:48:46,597
Speaker 0: You can donate you can pay to have They fit those little bumps inside of the outlet that you don't think about and it's just.

788
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,600
Speaker 1: it's just a pain.

789
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,249
Speaker 1: Why is it hard to make stuff go away?

790
00:48:50,570 --> 00:48:52,336
Speaker 1: That's why junk collector is a business.

791
00:48:52,497 --> 00:48:53,360
Speaker 0: Well, here's the money.

792
00:48:53,721 --> 00:48:57,356
Speaker 0: It's really easy to make things go away donating if you're crooked.

793
00:48:58,219 --> 00:49:01,515
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I mean when I was a kid Alice's restaurant just illegal dumping.

794
00:49:01,797 --> 00:49:03,345
Speaker 0: when I was a kid I think I was giving.

795
00:49:03,546 --> 00:49:17,643
Speaker 0: I told the story once on gig nights, but back in like 2006 I think I can tell it again, but I'll tell a shortened version to graduate high school with a certified diploma because I grew up in Michigan and they just passed a law about this I had to Do a certain amount of community service Which fine.

796
00:49:17,864 --> 00:49:33,720
Speaker 0: so I did a bunch of community service, but you could get a lot of it by Organizing a group go into a local park and picking up trash and like the city made it really easy to do So me and a bunch of friends were like, let's go to the park by the high school and pick up all the fucking trash.

797
00:49:34,082 --> 00:49:36,011
Speaker 0: And like 20 of us were like, let's fucking do it.

798
00:49:36,333 --> 00:49:37,719
Speaker 0: So we told the city we're gonna do it.

799
00:49:38,083 --> 00:49:43,320
Speaker 0: So at the in the evening at 6 p.m The city was gonna send a truck to pick up all the garbage we collected.

800
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:49,779
Speaker 0: We collected enough garbage to where the city could not deal with it.

801
00:49:50,321 --> 00:49:52,747
Speaker 0: We collected like I wanted.

802
00:49:52,768 --> 00:50:03,280
Speaker 0: the pile was about 10 feet tall and 30 or 40 feet long and it included radiators barbed wire tires Barrels pieces of cars.

803
00:50:03,922 --> 00:50:11,072
Speaker 0: We pulled an entire chassis of a car out of the woods into the collection area Like it was only the front of a chassis.

804
00:50:11,092 --> 00:50:12,360
Speaker 0: It was like broken off and rusted.

805
00:50:13,062 --> 00:50:20,291
Speaker 0: we pulled all this garbage out and the city was so mad they called the cops and the cops were like They were picking up garbage.

806
00:50:20,332 --> 00:50:21,260
Speaker 0: They didn't break any law.

807
00:50:21,380 --> 00:50:23,167
Speaker 0: You said you'd pick it up problems on you.

808
00:50:23,187 --> 00:50:27,723
Speaker 0: that pile of rusting metal sat there for like a month before the city could figure Out what to do with it.

809
00:50:27,743 --> 00:50:31,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's even hard for a city who is the people who collect the trash?

810
00:50:32,181 --> 00:50:34,773
Speaker 1: Oh, you know depending right to get rid of stuff.

811
00:50:35,054 --> 00:50:36,400
Speaker 0: a lot of it was barbed wire.

812
00:50:36,501 --> 00:50:40,059
Speaker 0: We pulled so much like rusted ass old barbed wire out of the woods next to this park.

813
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:51,200
Speaker 0: But if you're crooked, yeah Just roll your car off into the woods file the vent off and walk away Like just dump that paint down the drain and I think a lot of people do that shit, which is a problem.

814
00:50:51,341 --> 00:50:52,446
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a bit as long as you.

815
00:50:52,526 --> 00:50:58,580
Speaker 1: if you're doing illegal dumping if it's in an Environmentally damaging illegal dumping I am against that.

816
00:50:59,081 --> 00:51:03,895
Speaker 1: But if you are doing illegal dumping like put a rusty car on a wealthy person's lawn.

817
00:51:04,357 --> 00:51:05,139
Speaker 1: I am okay with that.

818
00:51:06,821 --> 00:51:09,859
Speaker 0: Well at one point we found a bunch of garbage that we were pretty sure.

819
00:51:10,242 --> 00:51:11,556
Speaker 0: I hope this is me and a few friends.

820
00:51:11,596 --> 00:51:18,008
Speaker 0: as a kid We were in the woods and we found all this garbage that we were pretty sure Was being dumped in the woods behind the property.

821
00:51:18,028 --> 00:51:21,740
Speaker 0: the people lived like in front because we saw the posts that were on the.

822
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:25,936
Speaker 0: all This fencing they dumped back there were the same style as the post that were on the property.

823
00:51:25,977 --> 00:51:26,720
Speaker 0: that looked nice and new.

824
00:51:27,441 --> 00:51:35,868
Speaker 0: So in the middle of the night one time me and a friend of mine went into the woods Grabbed all that garbage and put it on their front porch.

825
00:51:36,570 --> 00:51:37,492
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

826
00:51:37,552 --> 00:51:38,735
Speaker 0: I hope it was their garbage.

827
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:40,640
Speaker 0: We're pretty sure it was okay.

828
00:51:41,580 --> 00:51:49,960
Speaker 0: But even now like I don't want to just take this stuff downstairs because even if I dispose of it ethically It is just being thrown away when it could be used by someone theoretically.

829
00:51:50,483 --> 00:51:55,663
Speaker 0: But at the same time in the end I Am NOT accruing more stupid shit.

830
00:51:56,364 --> 00:52:04,320
Speaker 1: So if I get rid of all the shit, I think you know, they always talk about like, you know You know this recycling right recycling as we could do a whole episode of recycling.

831
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,260
Speaker 1: Reusing is always great, but we just talked about how hard it is to reuse.

832
00:52:09,921 --> 00:52:10,222
Speaker 1: Right.

833
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:12,471
Speaker 1: The best thing to do is reduce.

834
00:52:12,591 --> 00:52:14,700
Speaker 1: stop buying so much shit in the first place.

835
00:52:15,022 --> 00:52:17,840
Speaker 0: I don't buy things unless I need them specifically.

836
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:25,147
Speaker 1: I actually after I moved it to and I was buying a lot of stuff cuz I just moved for like maybe like a month For the past.

837
00:52:25,207 --> 00:52:26,192
Speaker 1: like, you know, I get what.

838
00:52:26,232 --> 00:52:27,860
Speaker 1: I went out and moved like September October.

839
00:52:28,483 --> 00:52:31,880
Speaker 1: Since like this other than like, you know presents for people in December.

840
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,750
Speaker 1: I don't think I really bought much since December.

841
00:52:35,051 --> 00:52:37,500
Speaker 1: like I basically have everything that I need.

842
00:52:37,641 --> 00:52:44,143
Speaker 1: I don't need much more other than consumable goods like TP or You know Stuff like that.

843
00:52:44,363 --> 00:52:44,624
Speaker 1: Yep.

844
00:52:44,965 --> 00:52:50,520
Speaker 0: It's mostly disposables consumables or like like I bought some audio equipment cuz I upgraded the pipeline.

845
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:52,890
Speaker 1: Hey, I think I basically don't need anything right now.

846
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,160
Speaker 1: Like I have no needs whatsoever.

847
00:52:55,461 --> 00:52:56,044
Speaker 1: Oh, I bought.

848
00:52:56,245 --> 00:52:59,800
Speaker 0: uh, I had to buy a new pepper grinder because the crap you want I've had forever to stop working.

849
00:53:00,081 --> 00:53:04,137
Speaker 1: Yeah, other than maintenance of the things I have to so that I don't have to replace them.

850
00:53:04,157 --> 00:53:06,474
Speaker 1: I I'm pretty much like I don't.

851
00:53:06,494 --> 00:53:07,481
Speaker 1: there's no kid I got.

852
00:53:07,501 --> 00:53:15,260
Speaker 0: but that's why even if in the end some of this stuff I end up just taking downstairs and having the city dispose of It's a one-time deal.

853
00:53:15,361 --> 00:53:22,180
Speaker 0: It's not like I'm gonna be throwing this Volume of crap away for the rest of my life constantly like certain people seem to do when they live in houses.
