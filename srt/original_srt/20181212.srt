1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,248
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, December 12th, 2018.

2
00:00:11,248 --> 00:00:12,090
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,111 --> 00:00:12,692
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:12,813 --> 00:00:13,976
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Night.

5
00:00:13,996 --> 00:00:17,979
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are talking about Mamoru Hosta's new movie Mirai.

6
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,519
Speaker 1: Or Mirai no Mirai.

7
00:00:21,261 --> 00:00:21,783
Speaker 0: Is it really that new?

8
00:00:21,803 --> 00:00:23,652
Speaker 0: Because the baby's name means future.

9
00:00:23,672 --> 00:00:25,500
Speaker 0: Is it just, is Mirai of the future?

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,283
Speaker 1: Yes.

11
00:00:26,765 --> 00:00:29,257
Speaker 0: Is this new in just the US or is it new in Japan?

12
00:00:29,297 --> 00:00:29,820
Speaker 1: Who even knows?

13
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,440
Speaker 0: I don't know, Japan 2018.

14
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:34,445
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

15
00:00:35,047 --> 00:00:37,880
Speaker 1: So I finally got some new monitors, and even though it's not a Monday show...

16
00:00:38,662 --> 00:00:40,047
Speaker 0: Well, the one on the right, maybe.

17
00:00:40,428 --> 00:00:41,331
Speaker 0: Yeah, the one on the right.

18
00:00:41,351 --> 00:00:44,300
Speaker 0: The one on the right, which is actually nothing wrong with it.

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,224
Speaker 0: It's just really old.

20
00:00:46,465 --> 00:00:49,652
Speaker 0: I bought that monitor in 2000, one, two, three, something like that.

21
00:00:53,801 --> 00:01:02,740
Speaker 1: I remember you were so excited about it because I still had a 19-inch CRT that weighed an infinite number of pounds that had literally bent my desk, and you got this LCD.

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:10,240
Speaker 1: that was the first LCD in the consumer market that had a fast enough refresh rate to use for any modern computing purpose, like playing games.

23
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,265
Speaker 0: Yeah, people don't know this.

24
00:01:11,285 --> 00:01:13,760
Speaker 0: The old LCD monitors, right?

25
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,763
Speaker 1: They didn't refresh.

26
00:01:15,923 --> 00:01:24,680
Speaker 1: Even if you sent enough frames to the monitor, the actual LEDs themselves, like the pixels on the monitor, could not refresh themselves fast enough.

27
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:24,901
Speaker 0: Right.

28
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:26,652
Speaker 0: So what happened is you get this ghosting effect.

29
00:01:26,773 --> 00:01:27,760
Speaker 0: Let's say you played Mario.

30
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,680
Speaker 0: You would see a ghost Mario behind the Mario, because Mario's going at 60 FPS, just like any NES game, right?

31
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:37,189
Speaker 0: But Mario moves to the right.

32
00:01:37,249 --> 00:01:41,420
Speaker 0: Well, Mario was just there, so that's a red pixel for where Mario's overalls were.

33
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,588
Speaker 0: But now it's got to be a blue pixel for the sky.

34
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:51,239
Speaker 0: But it wouldn't turn from red to blue quickly enough, so you'd sort of be able to see this ghost Mario behind the actual Mario moving, right?

35
00:01:51,601 --> 00:01:57,639
Speaker 0: And you couldn't play games like that, because you'd also have a ghost in front, where things weren't changing to red fast enough, right?

36
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:00,160
Speaker 0: So it looked like Mario was behind where he actually is.

37
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,810
Speaker 1: Basically, anything moving on screen.

38
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:03,400
Speaker 1: Remember, this was the early days of computing.

39
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:05,988
Speaker 1: Even watching a video was undoable.

40
00:02:06,028 --> 00:02:08,979
Speaker 1: They were only usable for looking at static images.

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,485
Speaker 0: Yeah, for text, it was fine.

42
00:02:10,506 --> 00:02:16,573
Speaker 0: Or for things that didn't move, it was fine, because you just need... Okay, so this image changes, but then you see what it changed into.

43
00:02:16,633 --> 00:02:20,955
Speaker 0: So text, it's like, okay, it blurs when I scroll, but I can read it when it stopped.

44
00:02:20,995 --> 00:02:21,760
Speaker 0: It's perfectly fine.

45
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:26,512
Speaker 0: But yeah, it was the SyncMaster, the Samsung SyncMaster 172X, 17-inch LCD monitor.

46
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:36,048
Speaker 0: It was an amazing monitor, both in its form factor, because it's basically just a panel on a little V-shaped stand.

47
00:02:36,069 --> 00:02:39,767
Speaker 0: It didn't have any extra, like, big chunky plastic or any other nonsense.

48
00:02:40,028 --> 00:02:42,380
Speaker 1: It has a smaller bezel than a lot of modern monitors.

49
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:46,793
Speaker 0: I really just wish modern monitors have the exact same form factor.

50
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:50,891
Speaker 0: Also, it only had VGA DVI, because that was the time.

51
00:02:50,911 --> 00:02:52,340
Speaker 0: The HDMI wasn't a thing yet.

52
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,851
Speaker 1: It had its special power brick.

53
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,160
Speaker 1: It didn't use the standard power adapter.

54
00:02:55,220 --> 00:03:00,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, that's part of the reason it was able to be so small, is because the power brick was on the outside of the monitor.

55
00:03:00,314 --> 00:03:01,200
Speaker 0: It wasn't in the monitor.

56
00:03:01,861 --> 00:03:13,400
Speaker 0: But you plugged in the cables into the base, not into the panel, and that's why the panel was so thin and able to move so freely, because all the electronics were outside of it.

57
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:16,092
Speaker 1: But my problem with it was that it just wasn't enough pixels.

58
00:03:16,152 --> 00:03:17,137
Speaker 1: It's this tiny 4x3 display.

59
00:03:18,241 --> 00:03:20,228
Speaker 0: It was a tiny 4x3, 17-inch monitor.

60
00:03:20,268 --> 00:03:21,974
Speaker 0: that's, what, is it 1280x1024 resolution, I think?

61
00:03:24,381 --> 00:03:25,072
Speaker 0: Something like that?

62
00:03:25,256 --> 00:03:25,479
Speaker 0: Yeah.

63
00:03:25,801 --> 00:03:27,226
Speaker 1: So I need a new monitor.

64
00:03:27,246 --> 00:03:30,780
Speaker 1: But also, my main monitor is pretty old, and it seemed fine.

65
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,020
Speaker 1: But now that I've looked at it next to a new monitor, it had gotten way dim relative to new.

66
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:38,044
Speaker 1: So anyway, I got new monitors.

67
00:03:38,064 --> 00:03:39,290
Speaker 1: That's not the news or anything.

68
00:03:39,631 --> 00:03:48,540
Speaker 1: The reason I bring it up is that it's around the holidays when a lot of people might be getting new monitors, and the modern way you connect monitors is DisplayPort.

69
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:51,468
Speaker 1: HDMI is really mostly used for TVs.

70
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:55,367
Speaker 1: If you have a good PC, you're going to use DisplayPort or DisplayPort.

71
00:03:55,407 --> 00:03:56,999
Speaker 1: That's the standard connector these days.

72
00:03:57,600 --> 00:04:09,460
Speaker 0: If you buy a video card these days, the vast majority of them, like the top-end video cards, right, will have a DisplayPort and an HDMI, or they'll have three DisplayPorts and an HDMI.

73
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:13,653
Speaker 0: It's really hard to find one that's got two HDMI.

74
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:19,360
Speaker 0: But don't worry, because you can just get, I bought one, I haven't tested it yet, a DisplayPort 2 HDMI cable.

75
00:04:20,043 --> 00:04:21,733
Speaker 0: I don't think it'll carry sound.

76
00:04:21,774 --> 00:04:22,499
Speaker 0: It might, I don't know.

77
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:25,548
Speaker 1: Well, here's the interesting thing.

78
00:04:25,628 --> 00:04:32,552
Speaker 1: A lot of those dongles, like DisplayPort to DVI, need power, because they need circuitry.

79
00:04:32,592 --> 00:04:34,280
Speaker 0: DisplayPort to HDMI is just a cable.

80
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,750
Speaker 0: There's no circuitry in it.

81
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,963
Speaker 1: But DisplayPort to DVI, I think, actually needs power.

82
00:04:38,705 --> 00:04:41,515
Speaker 1: In fact, DisplayPort 2, a lot of things, needs power.

83
00:04:41,956 --> 00:04:47,180
Speaker 1: So the DisplayPort spec is actually really crazy, because almost the same spec is using Thunderbolt cables for video.

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:52,325
Speaker 1: I know this is Geek Nights Wednesdays, not Monday, and some of you are starting to freak out, but trust me, you need to know this.

85
00:04:53,208 --> 00:05:02,397
Speaker 1: The long story short is that of all the pins inside of a DisplayPort cable, one of them will fucking destroy your video card or your monitor.

86
00:05:02,417 --> 00:05:04,243
Speaker 1: It is pin 20.

87
00:05:04,243 --> 00:05:06,591
Speaker 0: Yeah, pin 20 sends power, right?

88
00:05:06,631 --> 00:05:08,317
Speaker 1: Like five volts, like it's real power.

89
00:05:08,758 --> 00:05:10,766
Speaker 1: Enough power for USB to do something.

90
00:05:10,786 --> 00:05:14,282
Speaker 0: Right, so you could power a device, or you could even charge something, right?

91
00:05:14,382 --> 00:05:23,023
Speaker 0: Or if you had a really weak monitor that didn't need to be plugged into the wall, you could have a monitor that's powered by the DisplayPort cable if it's a really weak sauce monitor.

92
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:23,949
Speaker 1: So here's the problem.

93
00:05:24,231 --> 00:05:28,915
Speaker 1: In the old days, when someone made a cable, they just wired every pin to the other side, and they didn't think about it.

94
00:05:29,317 --> 00:05:36,868
Speaker 1: DisplayPort actually specifically says, don't fucking wire pin 20 unless you know what you're doing, and no one will know what they are doing.

95
00:05:36,908 --> 00:05:42,532
Speaker 1: There's literally no reason for pin 20 to be wired on any DisplayPort cable that has DisplayPort on both ends.

96
00:05:42,552 --> 00:05:49,706
Speaker 0: Yeah, even though there'll be 20 pins in the connector, because it has to be a standard connector, otherwise it won't fit, you only need 19 wires in there.

97
00:05:49,927 --> 00:05:52,780
Speaker 0: You don't need that 20th wire, you can just leave that one just unconnected.

98
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:55,909
Speaker 1: Yep, okay, it's 3.3 volt, not 5 volt, 500 milliamp.

99
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:56,431
Speaker 0: Whatever.

100
00:05:56,812 --> 00:06:04,415
Speaker 1: But almost any DisplayPort cable you buy anywhere, even ones from legit brands like Belkin, just wire pin 20.

101
00:06:04,415 --> 00:06:28,927
Speaker 1: And the only way to know they've done this, unless you have like a tester, like a cable tester, or you sit there with a multimeter and like our voltimeter and fuck with it, is you'll plug your new monitor into your computer, it'll seem like it's working fine, you'll turn your computer off, and then you try to turn your computer on and your video card is just dead, because it's been feeding power into your video card from the monitor.

102
00:06:29,869 --> 00:06:35,389
Speaker 1: So I ran into this problem, luckily the failure mode ended up being my computer wouldn't boot.

103
00:06:35,409 --> 00:06:42,060
Speaker 1: So I'm literally like, I bought these new monitors, I plugged them in, I've changed nothing else in my life, and the next day my computer won't boot.

104
00:06:42,961 --> 00:06:53,643
Speaker 1: So at first I think, all right, the odds are that I did not break anything, plugging new monitors in, so I assume my power supply is dead because I hit the power button, power supply goes click, nothing happens.

105
00:06:54,265 --> 00:06:59,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is, even though that makes sense based on the symptoms, the fact is you got new monitors.

106
00:06:59,727 --> 00:07:06,812
Speaker 0: If you changed a thing recently and that was a problem, 99% chance the thing you changed is the cause of the problem.

107
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:13,699
Speaker 1: So in my brain I'm thinking, so thus I have this cognitive dissonance, the thing I changed is highly unlikely to cause problem A.

108
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:14,641
Speaker 0: That's true.

109
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:32,026
Speaker 1: The thing I changed directly before problem A occurred is the thing that is unlikely to have caused problem A. So I fuck around a little bit, do some differential diagnosis, and then I remember while I'm doing this, this DisplayPort problem, because I talked about it on Geek Nines a long time ago.

110
00:07:32,848 --> 00:07:39,004
Speaker 1: It's not common knowledge, the moral is, if you use DisplayPort to plug something in,

111
00:07:39,787 --> 00:07:40,027
Speaker 0: only

112
00:07:40,148 --> 00:08:00,134
Speaker 1: use a DisplayPort cable that came with the monitor, that came with your video card or computer, or buy the AmazonBasics one, because that seems to be the only cable that is known to not wire pin 20, and even if you think you're buying an expensive, fancy DisplayPort cable, it probably has pin 20 wired.

113
00:08:00,395 --> 00:08:07,725
Speaker 0: All my DisplayPort cables came with monitors I bought and are thus perfectly fine, and I've never had a problem, but I haven't ever bought a DisplayPort cable.

114
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,362
Speaker 0: The other thing is that you might say, "Well, wait, what if I want the power?

115
00:08:13,485 --> 00:08:15,049
Speaker 0: I would have to get a broken cable on

116
00:08:15,089 --> 00:08:15,290
Speaker 0: purpose.".

117
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:25,719
Speaker 0: But actually, the thing is, almost any device you buy that needs or wants that power will have an integrated cable.

118
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:32,302
Speaker 0: That's what you're supposed to do, is like, "Oh, I've made a thing that needs DisplayPort power, so it has a built-in DisplayPort

119
00:08:32,322 --> 00:08:32,604
Speaker 0: cable.".

120
00:08:32,664 --> 00:08:34,390
Speaker 0: Like, it's literally just a weird device.

121
00:08:35,355 --> 00:08:38,066
Speaker 0: Let's say it's a tiny monitor, right, that needs the power.

122
00:08:38,548 --> 00:08:41,480
Speaker 0: It won't even have a hole for DisplayPort cables to be attached.

123
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:47,430
Speaker 0: It'll literally just have a cable coming out of it with DisplayPort on one end, and the monitor already on the other end, and you can't change the cable.

124
00:08:47,571 --> 00:08:49,460
Speaker 1: Yep, the official DisplayPort fact.

125
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,127
Speaker 1: You're not supposed to make...

126
00:08:51,468 --> 00:08:57,311
Speaker 0: Right, you're supposed to, if you're using the power, you're supposed to have one end of the cable just going right into the device.

127
00:08:57,331 --> 00:09:02,672
Speaker 0: If you're making a cable that's on its own, you're not supposed to have the 20th wire in there.

128
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,162
Speaker 1: Yep, so that was my adventure.

129
00:09:05,202 --> 00:09:07,451
Speaker 1: Thankfully, it only prevented my computer from booting.

130
00:09:07,812 --> 00:09:14,963
Speaker 1: Once I cut that broken-ass cable in two and threw it away and put a different cable on, everything was copacetic, and my video card still works.

131
00:09:15,746 --> 00:09:20,042
Speaker 1: That DisplayPort hole also still works, which was a worry, because that's the common symptom of this.

132
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:28,635
Speaker 0: I think, I don't know if this is true or not, but I imagine, you know, say Nvidia or whoever, EVGA or whoever's making cards and stuff and monitors.

133
00:09:28,675 --> 00:09:31,185
Speaker 1: They don't want to brick a bunch of video cards.

134
00:09:31,205 --> 00:09:35,183
Speaker 0: I wonder if they would be, you know, building in defenses against this obvious problem.

135
00:09:35,203 --> 00:09:44,139
Speaker 1: Well, it's subtle, because it would, it fixed itself and worked fine if I turned everything off, waited a while, and turned it back on, because, like, that power would dissipate.

136
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:55,243
Speaker 1: But basically, the deal is, it'll be 3.3 volts on both sides, so depending on luck chance, like, what particular video card you have, what particular monitor do you have, current might be going in either direction.

137
00:09:55,985 --> 00:09:57,810
Speaker 1: Like, it's a weird situation.

138
00:09:58,693 --> 00:10:03,470
Speaker 1: So, thankfully, everything is fine, and now we will talk about, actually, actual animation and such.

139
00:10:03,551 --> 00:10:03,691
Speaker 1: So,

140
00:10:03,711 --> 00:10:24,523
Speaker 0: the huge, biggest anime news that no one can shut up about is that, if you don't know, one of the biggest, most important, amazingest animes of all time that no one can shut up about, even after 20 something, who knows how many years, Neon Genesis Evangelion, which has been unavailable for legal distribution in the United States for quite a long time.

141
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:30,585
Speaker 0: Which is a travesty, because- Because ADV had it, and then they put out those platinum DVDs, eventually.

142
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:31,367
Speaker 1: Which I own.

143
00:10:31,588 --> 00:10:37,547
Speaker 0: And then, after that, there was no, like, legal way to buy the show in the United States.

144
00:10:37,567 --> 00:10:40,678
Speaker 0: I mean, those, they got those movies, some of them, right?

145
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:49,387
Speaker 0: But the actual 26 episode TV series, and some of the original movies, I don't know about those, but the, you know, the newer movies you can get, right?

146
00:10:49,407 --> 00:10:50,251
Speaker 0: Those are a separate thing.

147
00:10:50,532 --> 00:10:56,211
Speaker 0: The re-whatever, the 111- Evangelion- The 111, you cannot watch the original, right?

148
00:10:56,251 --> 00:10:56,953
Speaker 0: Whatever.

149
00:10:57,415 --> 00:11:03,375
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, they've never been, as far as I know, legally streamed on any streamy site.

150
00:11:03,535 --> 00:11:13,651
Speaker 0: They have not been available on DVD or Buray or any sort of other way to legally watch them in the US and most other non-Japan countries that I know of for many years.

151
00:11:13,772 --> 00:11:20,856
Speaker 1: This is a travesty, because I don't care if you love Evangelion or hate Evangelion, you cannot deny that Evangelion is super important.

152
00:11:20,876 --> 00:11:25,636
Speaker 1: There's a reason people keep complaining about it and talking about it to this goddamn day.

153
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:26,018
Speaker 0: Right.

154
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:27,504
Speaker 0: There's many illegal ways to watch it.

155
00:11:27,584 --> 00:11:27,966
Speaker 0: Yeah.

156
00:11:28,307 --> 00:11:30,355
Speaker 0: And you can always get the old DVDs, nothing stopping you.

157
00:11:31,439 --> 00:11:31,720
Speaker 0: But yeah.

158
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,987
Speaker 1: Except the fact that I don't own any optical drives.

159
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:41,449
Speaker 0: I have rips of the DVD, and I have, I was playing, if I ever need to, I'm planning to buy a USB optical drive.

160
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:42,011
Speaker 0: Yeah.

161
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:51,507
Speaker 0: Anyway, so, a lot of companies were trying to get it, like, Funimation was trying to get it, to license it so they could put it out again for people to see again.

162
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,244
Speaker 0: And Netflix, with their big money sack, has managed to succeed in doing this.

163
00:11:56,324 --> 00:12:00,137
Speaker 0: And Evangelion is going to come to Netflix sometime next year.

164
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:09,995
Speaker 1: This is big for a lot of reasons, because we don't need, like, existing anime fans who know about Ava to be able to see it, because like Scott said, we've all seen it and have some way to see it.

165
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:18,970
Speaker 1: The idea here is that a lot of people who might have never watched anime might just watch this groundbreaking amazing show by chance and get into anime.

166
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,974
Speaker 0: So here's the thing, right?

167
00:12:19,994 --> 00:12:23,084
Speaker 0: So number one, issue number one, they're going to redub it.

168
00:12:23,184 --> 00:12:25,432
Speaker 1: Which I 100% approve of.

169
00:12:25,552 --> 00:12:29,386
Speaker 0: Some people are mad because they have this nostalgia for the original dub.

170
00:12:29,486 --> 00:12:31,233
Speaker 0: Guys, like, those people are wrong.

171
00:12:31,253 --> 00:12:34,164
Speaker 0: The original dub was a garbage dub, burn it in fire.

172
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:44,202
Speaker 1: Like, on one hand, I'm sympathetic to the voice actors who were in that dub, because for a lot of them, like, frankly, that was the, like, most prominent job they ever got.

173
00:12:44,845 --> 00:12:46,413
Speaker 0: And it was a big part of their careers.

174
00:12:46,433 --> 00:12:48,463
Speaker 0: Of course, they're not making any money off it anymore, though.

175
00:12:48,483 --> 00:12:49,267
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

176
00:12:49,488 --> 00:12:51,055
Speaker 0: But at the point, actually, it's bad for them.

177
00:12:51,075 --> 00:12:57,805
Speaker 0: I think, you know, even though that dub is bad and they did a bad job, I still feel like, hey, that kind of burns them over, right?

178
00:12:57,845 --> 00:13:02,429
Speaker 0: But here's the thing, if you're going to re-release it, you should use that dub so those people can keep getting their money.

179
00:13:02,449 --> 00:13:04,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, but as we've learned...

180
00:13:04,137 --> 00:13:05,725
Speaker 0: I don't know if their deals pay them that way.

181
00:13:05,745 --> 00:13:06,247
Speaker 0: I think they do.

182
00:13:06,629 --> 00:13:10,205
Speaker 1: As we've learned in almost all cases, those voice actors are great on their own.

183
00:13:10,285 --> 00:13:12,998
Speaker 1: The problem with anime voice acting was usually the directors.

184
00:13:13,219 --> 00:13:16,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, so that's issue number one.

185
00:13:16,731 --> 00:13:19,961
Speaker 0: And I say, even though Netflix is redubbing, you don't want that.

186
00:13:20,001 --> 00:13:21,968
Speaker 0: You want the Japanese language.

187
00:13:22,028 --> 00:13:33,864
Speaker 1: However, one thing, because irrespective of if the dub was good or bad, in terms of anime dubs, the fact remains that pretty much every 90s anime dub was bad by any objective measure.

188
00:13:34,325 --> 00:13:35,346
Speaker 1: Like, they all sound the same.

189
00:13:35,366 --> 00:13:40,800
Speaker 1: You can hear random audio in the room and you'll immediately say, that is a 90s anime dub.

190
00:13:40,881 --> 00:13:50,776
Speaker 0: Right, anyway, so issue number two is that the person in charge of Funimation, the president of Funimation, Gen Fukunaga, I always forget that he's a weird dude.

191
00:13:50,796 --> 00:14:08,418
Speaker 0: He's a weird, bad, Christian, right wing kind of weirdo dude who's not a great person, but he's making news because his comments regarding Netflix's license and he had two main points that are kind of mostly sort of true and we can just not talk about him right now and just talk about the points he's made.

192
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:14,609
Speaker 0: So point number and sort of his points also include a bit of sour grapes that he didn't get the license as opposed to Netflix getting it.

193
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:14,971
Speaker 0: Yeah.

194
00:14:15,091 --> 00:14:20,917
Speaker 0: But anyway, his first point is that like, look, Netflix is just going to toss this up on Netflix with all the other stuff, right?

195
00:14:21,198 --> 00:14:24,952
Speaker 0: They're not going to like go around promoting it at anime cons.

196
00:14:24,972 --> 00:14:30,450
Speaker 0: They're not going to be like a brand ambassador for this show, pushing it, right?

197
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,783
Speaker 0: Getting it in, you know, on all the different places, right?

198
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:36,395
Speaker 0: They're just going to get it and put it on Netflix.

199
00:14:36,616 --> 00:14:38,326
Speaker 1: Specifically, like you said, anime cons.

200
00:14:38,366 --> 00:14:41,221
Speaker 1: That is the last audience I would go after if I was Netflix.

201
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:47,568
Speaker 0: I'm just saying it's like, you know, if Funimation had it right, look at what Funimation, you know, his example was My Hero Academia.

202
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:48,472
Speaker 0: That was his example.

203
00:14:48,532 --> 00:14:51,928
Speaker 0: Is that like, look, Funimation licensed that show and pushed it.

204
00:14:51,968 --> 00:14:52,229
Speaker 0: Got them.

205
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:54,257
Speaker 0: You know, you get the merch, you get that, right?

206
00:14:54,458 --> 00:14:57,752
Speaker 0: It's like they pushed the brand and all avenues of media to like.

207
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:58,776
Speaker 0: make it a thing.

208
00:14:59,237 --> 00:15:04,719
Speaker 0: If Netflix had licensed My Hero Academia, it would have just been another show on Netflix that some people would have watched.

209
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:10,663
Speaker 0: It wouldn't have been able to grow into the somewhat, you know, phenomena that it is in the U.S.

210
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:11,445
Speaker 0: as an anime.

211
00:15:11,486 --> 00:15:13,372
Speaker 0: It's pretty big considering, right?

212
00:15:13,512 --> 00:15:17,726
Speaker 0: So it's like, well, look, his argument is kind of agree, right?

213
00:15:17,786 --> 00:15:20,998
Speaker 0: If he licensed Ava, it's like, well, Ava already sort of had its run.

214
00:15:21,078 --> 00:15:24,733
Speaker 0: So it's not the same, really a one for one match with, say, My Hero.

215
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:26,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, I take even more issue.

216
00:15:26,437 --> 00:15:28,121
Speaker 0: They would still be pushing a lot.

217
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:37,637
Speaker 0: You Funimation would do, even though they're smaller than Netflix, whereas Netflix is just going to be, well, Ava is another show on Netflix.

218
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:41,014
Speaker 0: But at the same time, like, do you see a push for like Dragon Prince?

219
00:15:41,376 --> 00:15:43,246
Speaker 0: There could be a Funimation at Dragon Prince.

220
00:15:43,286 --> 00:15:43,929
Speaker 0: There would be a push.

221
00:15:44,391 --> 00:15:52,705
Speaker 1: I feel like what's going to happen and what their strategy is that shows like Dragon Prince or in particular Ava, they're hoping for the word of mouth.

222
00:15:52,765 --> 00:16:01,521
Speaker 1: I think they're waiting to see which of the shows they put out there get more general, non-nish audience word of mouth and they can figure out from there what to push and what to invest in.

223
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:02,747
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Netflix doesn't.

224
00:16:02,848 --> 00:16:04,816
Speaker 0: even the stuff that they make that gets big.

225
00:16:04,856 --> 00:16:09,335
Speaker 0: They don't sort of make this, you know, this they don't make it into a cultural thing.

226
00:16:09,395 --> 00:16:09,696
Speaker 0: They're just.

227
00:16:09,757 --> 00:16:12,189
Speaker 0: they're just things to get people to subscribe to Netflix.

228
00:16:12,269 --> 00:16:12,390
Speaker 0: Right.

229
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:12,991
Speaker 0: Yeah.

230
00:16:13,011 --> 00:16:21,488
Speaker 0: So anyway, the second point that he made, which I think is maybe the more interesting point, is that like, look, Netflix licensed this by emptying their gigantic piggy bank.

231
00:16:21,889 --> 00:16:22,050
Speaker 1: Yeah.

232
00:16:22,251 --> 00:16:23,377
Speaker 0: It's like they bid more.

233
00:16:23,417 --> 00:16:24,181
Speaker 0: That's why they got it.

234
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:25,066
Speaker 0: And Funimation didn't.

235
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:25,347
Speaker 0: Right.

236
00:16:25,387 --> 00:16:27,314
Speaker 0: And Funimation didn't have enough money for this.

237
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:28,056
Speaker 0: Right.

238
00:16:28,297 --> 00:16:36,383
Speaker 0: But that sets a bad juju for licensing anime in the future by setting that price so artificially high.

239
00:16:36,604 --> 00:16:41,582
Speaker 0: You could have a situation where like, well, now the price of licensing an anime from Japan costs way more.

240
00:16:41,884 --> 00:16:43,008
Speaker 0: So only Netflix can do it.

241
00:16:43,028 --> 00:16:52,158
Speaker 0: And now the Funimation of the world die because they can't afford to license any shows because the price has been artificially inflated by this, you know, this customer.

242
00:16:52,438 --> 00:17:01,765
Speaker 0: But, you know, here's willing to overpay and effectively like Netflix could like overpay for all the anime to destroy all the anime companies.

243
00:17:01,785 --> 00:17:15,207
Speaker 1: If that payment model, if like this going rate is sustainable by Netflix and works out and is profitable, what it really means is that a lot more money will go back into the actual studios and licenses in Japan.

244
00:17:16,030 --> 00:17:19,863
Speaker 1: Maybe it could actually make a much more healthy production ecosystem.

245
00:17:19,883 --> 00:17:26,971
Speaker 0: But, you know, but probably, you know, Netflix is going to be buying it at they're not going to make as much money off as they paid for the license.

246
00:17:27,373 --> 00:17:30,688
Speaker 1: I don't know how Netflix is going to make money in the long run, like at all.

247
00:17:30,769 --> 00:17:31,512
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

248
00:17:31,693 --> 00:17:32,256
Speaker 1: No one does.

249
00:17:32,377 --> 00:17:34,586
Speaker 0: They're just jacking up the price on these things.

250
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:41,395
Speaker 0: So that'll hurt the people who are actually licensing at a reasonable price, even though it gives some more money to the Japanese creators.

251
00:17:41,415 --> 00:17:44,951
Speaker 0: But it's like, OK, you're giving money to like Ava already made its money.

252
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:45,332
Speaker 0: Right.

253
00:17:45,413 --> 00:17:46,296
Speaker 0: It's like, come on.

254
00:17:46,357 --> 00:17:46,457
Speaker 0: Yeah.

255
00:17:46,618 --> 00:17:46,778
Speaker 0: Yeah.

256
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:57,565
Speaker 1: But also, the other thing is this is different because this isn't funding the production of a new show, nor is it picking up something, but it's going to costing Netflix more than a new show, which probably needs that money.

257
00:17:58,108 --> 00:18:01,644
Speaker 1: I guess what will be interesting, like the real data point we need forget anime fans.

258
00:18:01,704 --> 00:18:04,193
Speaker 1: like the read the redub is probably going to be good.

259
00:18:04,213 --> 00:18:08,168
Speaker 0: I mean, quality wise, I mean, it would be hard for it to be worse.

260
00:18:08,449 --> 00:18:18,272
Speaker 0: I think the redub, you know, considering that, like the, you know, the Castlevania Netflix put out, which is not an anime technique, I'd say it's technically an anime, but I mean, it doesn't.

261
00:18:18,292 --> 00:18:18,875
Speaker 0: It's anime.

262
00:18:19,076 --> 00:18:19,337
Speaker 0: It doesn't.

263
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:20,342
Speaker 0: It doesn't have Japanese.

264
00:18:20,463 --> 00:18:22,292
Speaker 0: It's original English language is the point.

265
00:18:22,413 --> 00:18:23,076
Speaker 0: that doesn't matter.

266
00:18:23,297 --> 00:18:24,201
Speaker 0: And it's still a dub.

267
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:25,667
Speaker 0: And that is perfectly fine.

268
00:18:25,728 --> 00:18:28,058
Speaker 1: I mean, Big O2 was released in the US first.

269
00:18:28,098 --> 00:18:31,951
Speaker 0: The original English language dialogue and voice the track.

270
00:18:32,092 --> 00:18:32,473
Speaker 1: Yeah.

271
00:18:32,493 --> 00:18:33,156
Speaker 1: Studio made it.

272
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:34,239
Speaker 1: That's the answer.

273
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:36,325
Speaker 1: It's anime anyway.

274
00:18:36,626 --> 00:18:39,494
Speaker 0: But the point is, is that it wasn't the original language.

275
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:42,624
Speaker 0: audio track of Castlevania was not Japanese.

276
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:44,069
Speaker 0: It was English and it was good.

277
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:44,491
Speaker 1: Yeah.

278
00:18:44,672 --> 00:18:45,214
Speaker 1: Well, that's so.

279
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:48,405
Speaker 0: it does do the same kind of job on the Ava dub.

280
00:18:48,445 --> 00:18:48,866
Speaker 1: I get back to that.

281
00:18:48,886 --> 00:18:49,729
Speaker 1: I get back to that.

282
00:18:49,789 --> 00:18:54,122
Speaker 1: I get back to the dub when it's the original.

283
00:18:54,342 --> 00:19:01,009
Speaker 1: The reason a lot like anime had a hard time breaking into the mainstream is that regular folk like it or not don't like subtitles.

284
00:19:01,030 --> 00:19:02,196
Speaker 1: And you still can't get away from that.

285
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:03,623
Speaker 0: I think that people see.

286
00:19:03,703 --> 00:19:05,692
Speaker 0: I think people keep saying things like that.

287
00:19:06,013 --> 00:19:07,138
Speaker 0: I don't see any evidence for it.

288
00:19:07,198 --> 00:19:11,557
Speaker 0: Frigging Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon here, the theaters in the US and was a huge phenomenon.

289
00:19:11,597 --> 00:19:14,148
Speaker 0: It was subtitled only and it wasn't a fucking problem.

290
00:19:14,389 --> 00:19:17,261
Speaker 0: And people just have this idea that, like, oh, people won't read.

291
00:19:17,341 --> 00:19:18,627
Speaker 0: There are some people who can't read.

292
00:19:18,969 --> 00:19:23,790
Speaker 0: If you put a movie with subtitles and people want to see it, they will see it and they won't complain.

293
00:19:23,951 --> 00:19:28,251
Speaker 0: There's only like a few loud people who are really dumb intellectual complain about subtitles.

294
00:19:28,512 --> 00:19:31,746
Speaker 0: Most people can watch things with subtitles without even thinking about it.

295
00:19:31,786 --> 00:19:33,091
Speaker 0: You can do it often.

296
00:19:33,453 --> 00:19:37,165
Speaker 0: And there is no evidence to suggest that there's anything to contrary.

297
00:19:38,128 --> 00:19:45,660
Speaker 0: I have Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, as well as many other mod, you know, that's probably the most successful subtitled movie ever released in the US.

298
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:50,280
Speaker 0: But there are others that have been released in the US with subtitles that have done just fine.

299
00:19:50,561 --> 00:19:54,560
Speaker 1: You're assuming a lot to their, you know, you're assuming a lot based on no data.

300
00:19:54,940 --> 00:20:03,417
Speaker 1: You're also there's no data for the position that subtitles will kill anything except for all the data that's held inside the studios that make these decisions.

301
00:20:03,477 --> 00:20:07,012
Speaker 0: But people aren't putting anything out with subtitles to get any data.

302
00:20:07,032 --> 00:20:07,856
Speaker 0: You have no data.

303
00:20:08,137 --> 00:20:11,795
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, here is the thing that was put out with subtitles, the only thing that you can think of.

304
00:20:12,136 --> 00:20:12,900
Speaker 0: And it did just fine.

305
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,983
Speaker 0: It did great, in fact.

306
00:20:14,985 --> 00:20:15,346
Speaker 1: Yeah.

307
00:20:15,527 --> 00:20:17,893
Speaker 1: One, a movie, not a long TV show.

308
00:20:19,157 --> 00:20:20,742
Speaker 0: I'm just saying you could put things out.

309
00:20:20,823 --> 00:20:25,205
Speaker 1: I'm just saying your evidence is purely anecdotal and you're not putting enough things out with something.

310
00:20:25,466 --> 00:20:31,148
Speaker 0: I have there's one thing that's been put out with subtitles that was major to in the US market.

311
00:20:31,449 --> 00:20:32,653
Speaker 0: And it did just fine.

312
00:20:32,974 --> 00:20:33,617
Speaker 0: Where are all the?

313
00:20:33,918 --> 00:20:36,850
Speaker 0: if you're going to say that subtitles only will kill a thing.

314
00:20:37,231 --> 00:20:42,574
Speaker 0: Show me all the things that were put out with subtitles only that died and weren't big things, you know, to begin with.

315
00:20:42,835 --> 00:20:44,441
Speaker 1: I'm confident that it's not worth the risk.

316
00:20:44,482 --> 00:20:48,920
Speaker 1: If I were running a studio, I would not release subtitle only content for the mainstream.

317
00:20:49,301 --> 00:20:50,708
Speaker 1: I would for a TV show.

318
00:20:50,728 --> 00:20:54,083
Speaker 0: Well, I save so much fucking money and I'd say, oh, look, people are watching it anyway.

319
00:20:54,143 --> 00:20:54,404
Speaker 0: Whoo.

320
00:20:54,766 --> 00:20:55,650
Speaker 0: I've saved all this money.

321
00:20:55,911 --> 00:21:02,117
Speaker 1: Also, you forget that most modern TV watching culture involves people who are either multitasking or they want.

322
00:21:02,137 --> 00:21:04,268
Speaker 1: They need to hear it because they're not actually looking at the screen.

323
00:21:04,288 --> 00:21:05,675
Speaker 0: They're not watching then.

324
00:21:05,856 --> 00:21:09,213
Speaker 1: And you can say that and you can make that point and die on that stupid hill.

325
00:21:09,233 --> 00:21:11,523
Speaker 1: But the reality is that most people consume media.

326
00:21:11,664 --> 00:21:15,982
Speaker 0: Listen, people aren't paying to, you know, to see the individual show and they get Netflix.

327
00:21:16,864 --> 00:21:21,177
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Netflix needs to pay for the download.

328
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:21,879
Speaker 0: That might matter.

329
00:21:21,939 --> 00:21:22,079
Speaker 0: Yeah.

330
00:21:22,099 --> 00:21:31,038
Speaker 1: But again, you're conflating the separation of how the fuck is Netflix going to make money in the long run from these, like the actual studio production or like release cycle media.

331
00:21:31,298 --> 00:21:37,483
Speaker 0: They just put, if they put Ava on Netflix with just the subs, then I think I think only anime new weeaboos would watch it.

332
00:21:37,523 --> 00:21:37,985
Speaker 1: No one else.

333
00:21:38,045 --> 00:21:43,509
Speaker 0: Just as many view as just about as it's going to get with their dub that they got to spend a lot of money on.

334
00:21:43,530 --> 00:21:48,633
Speaker 1: I am confident you'd see a like one third audience drop off after a couple of episodes.

335
00:21:48,894 --> 00:21:49,276
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

336
00:21:49,617 --> 00:21:50,601
Speaker 1: I'm pretty confident in that.

337
00:21:51,043 --> 00:21:54,916
Speaker 0: I think the real show is so big and compelling that you're going to watch it.

338
00:21:54,936 --> 00:22:03,330
Speaker 1: To test here, because a big reason why people didn't watch a lot of like mainstream people to watch anime in the nineties wasn't just the dub sub thing.

339
00:22:03,410 --> 00:22:08,870
Speaker 1: It was more that if it was on TV, it was just dubbed and those dubs are all bad and weird.

340
00:22:09,512 --> 00:22:23,243
Speaker 1: If this just has a normal dub, like quote unquote normal and seems like it's just another animated show and someone watches like Bojack Horseman and then it recommends watch this Evangeline show and they just click on it and it's just similar to those shows.

341
00:22:23,544 --> 00:22:31,044
Speaker 1: I think the test will be if a mainstream you watch Bojack Horseman also you might like Evangeline.

342
00:22:31,265 --> 00:22:34,696
Speaker 1: You know, I think there's a better one.

343
00:22:34,716 --> 00:22:36,120
Speaker 0: You might like Evangeline.

344
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:38,749
Speaker 1: I think that Venn Diagram is also pretty good.

345
00:22:39,572 --> 00:22:41,398
Speaker 1: All I'm saying is that the point of interest.

346
00:22:41,418 --> 00:22:43,065
Speaker 0: you watch Peppa Pig, you might like it.

347
00:22:43,687 --> 00:22:44,751
Speaker 1: Nobody likes Peppa Pig.

348
00:22:45,093 --> 00:22:45,776
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

349
00:22:45,996 --> 00:22:48,283
Speaker 1: No, Kaluu is the one everyone makes fun of anyway.

350
00:22:49,386 --> 00:22:51,129
Speaker 1: But the point will be, do?

351
00:22:51,711 --> 00:23:02,060
Speaker 1: does the mainstream media watching like non anime, non insider, non niche people start talking about Ava within six months of it being on Netflix?

352
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:07,397
Speaker 0: Also, Ava is not only Ava, but anime is way more enormous than it appears, right?

353
00:23:07,658 --> 00:23:16,729
Speaker 0: All the nerd culture things in general, you know, watching esports on Twitch, anime, all this stuff is way big, but just doesn't appear big.

354
00:23:16,749 --> 00:23:17,532
Speaker 0: Right.

355
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:18,294
Speaker 0: In general.

356
00:23:18,375 --> 00:23:18,595
Speaker 0: Right.

357
00:23:18,615 --> 00:23:22,729
Speaker 0: That's why you get like an E3 smaller than, say, an Otacon used to be.

358
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:23,472
Speaker 0: Right.

359
00:23:23,752 --> 00:23:27,746
Speaker 0: And it's like, well, Otacon makes the local paper and E3 makes the world news.

360
00:23:27,967 --> 00:23:28,128
Speaker 0: Right.

361
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:31,160
Speaker 0: Even though the size of the things is, you know, pretty similar.

362
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:31,541
Speaker 1: Right.

363
00:23:31,561 --> 00:23:40,334
Speaker 1: But the last point before we move on to review the actual thing we're reviewing tonight is the the fact that they're paying all this extra money for Ava.

364
00:23:40,414 --> 00:23:43,544
Speaker 1: But this is an old established, super big show.

365
00:23:43,565 --> 00:23:49,889
Speaker 1: They've really only set a precedent for paying a huge licensing fee for like the top 10 shows of all time.

366
00:23:50,651 --> 00:23:55,567
Speaker 1: Like if they get Cowboy Bebop, they get, you know, I think they're making a live action one.

367
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,272
Speaker 0: Yeah.

368
00:23:57,453 --> 00:24:00,644
Speaker 0: This is like the what, the 10th attempt at a live action Cowboy Bebop.

369
00:24:01,085 --> 00:24:03,231
Speaker 1: I'm not super excited about that.

370
00:24:03,292 --> 00:24:06,622
Speaker 0: I'm not excited for any live action, anything.

371
00:24:06,662 --> 00:24:07,950
Speaker 0: Just give me the original thing.

372
00:24:07,990 --> 00:24:08,553
Speaker 0: That was great.

373
00:24:08,573 --> 00:24:09,640
Speaker 0: You don't need to do it again.

374
00:24:10,202 --> 00:24:16,447
Speaker 0: But I am excited for is more of not, you know, redoing a thing in a different format, but more of a thing.

375
00:24:16,467 --> 00:24:17,474
Speaker 0: because guess what?

376
00:24:17,494 --> 00:24:18,420
Speaker 0: We're getting more Ghost in the Shell.

377
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:19,080
Speaker 1: Yep.

378
00:24:19,322 --> 00:24:23,320
Speaker 1: Well, I was going to talk about that later, but we'll talk about it once there's more info.

379
00:24:23,441 --> 00:24:34,393
Speaker 1: But the important thing to know about the new Ghost in the Shell is that based on the announcements about the initial creative team, it is much more likely to be like standalone complex as opposed to being like Arise.

380
00:24:34,513 --> 00:24:35,898
Speaker 0: Also Arise is on Netflix.

381
00:24:35,939 --> 00:24:39,853
Speaker 0: And I only saw one episode of it in the theater.

382
00:24:39,913 --> 00:24:41,318
Speaker 1: I've watched it all.

383
00:24:41,338 --> 00:24:43,168
Speaker 0: I haven't watched anything other than what we saw in that theater.

384
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:43,912
Speaker 0: I watched it all.

385
00:24:44,013 --> 00:24:45,099
Speaker 1: I will give you my review.

386
00:24:45,139 --> 00:24:46,283
Speaker 1: This is everything you need to know.

387
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:53,822
Speaker 1: It is pretty good, but all it does is make you wish it was standalone complex.

388
00:24:53,842 --> 00:24:55,328
Speaker 1: the entire time you're watching it.

389
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:01,791
Speaker 1: And every moment, all you can think is, wow, this is okay, but God damn standalone complex.

390
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:03,277
Speaker 1: And that's it.

391
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:04,701
Speaker 1: That's the best thing I can say about it.

392
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:05,263
Speaker 1: It's alright.

393
00:25:05,965 --> 00:25:12,382
Speaker 1: This one, the new Ghost in the Shell looks as close to standalone complex as we're likely ever going to get.

394
00:25:18,253 --> 00:25:20,637
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

395
00:25:20,918 --> 00:25:29,950
Speaker 1: So I was looking around for some actual 4K streaming content because the only 4K content I actually had local is videos of myself and/or Scott.

396
00:25:30,312 --> 00:25:30,472
Speaker 0: Yeah.

397
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:33,927
Speaker 0: I mean, there's no one who's streaming in 4K because no one has the bandwidth for that.

398
00:25:33,947 --> 00:25:34,650
Speaker 0: I mean, I do.

399
00:25:34,711 --> 00:25:37,162
Speaker 0: On YouTube, there's plenty of 4K stuff, right?

400
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,130
Speaker 0: But not a whole bunch.

401
00:25:39,551 --> 00:25:41,419
Speaker 0: It's not easy to just search like show me something 4K.

402
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:45,355
Speaker 0: You're only going to find stuff that has 4K in the title, right?

403
00:25:45,415 --> 00:25:47,465
Speaker 0: Which would be like 4K test videos and stuff.

404
00:25:47,706 --> 00:25:51,924
Speaker 1: So I found a pretty good video that I use to sort of play with these monitors and calibrate them and everything.

405
00:25:52,526 --> 00:25:56,660
Speaker 1: And it really made it clear how big a difference more pixels is.

406
00:25:57,020 --> 00:26:04,016
Speaker 1: This is just a really long fractal zoom into a Mandelbrot at 4K 60 FPS.

407
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:05,319
Speaker 1: That's it.

408
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:06,785
Speaker 0: That's my thing of the day.

409
00:26:06,845 --> 00:26:07,106
Speaker 0: Wow.

410
00:26:07,166 --> 00:26:07,568
Speaker 0: Exciting.

411
00:26:07,588 --> 00:26:08,050
Speaker 0: It's pretty cool.

412
00:26:08,773 --> 00:26:09,215
Speaker 1: I liked it.

413
00:26:09,376 --> 00:26:10,240
Speaker 0: Alright, so check this out.

414
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:10,863
Speaker 0: I learned something.

415
00:26:10,883 --> 00:26:11,507
Speaker 1: I'm into it right now.

416
00:26:11,547 --> 00:26:12,251
Speaker 1: Let's keep watching it.

417
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:14,584
Speaker 0: It was a rule in ice hockey that I was unaware of.

418
00:26:14,604 --> 00:26:15,890
Speaker 0: There's probably others I'm unaware of.

419
00:26:15,910 --> 00:26:24,832
Speaker 1: I remember when you tried to argue against me when I told you about the rule where it's not offsides if you go into the zone before the puck, but you have control of this puck.

420
00:26:25,314 --> 00:26:27,463
Speaker 1: So you can skate in backwards with the puck and it's totally okay.

421
00:26:27,564 --> 00:26:28,186
Speaker 0: I thought you couldn't.

422
00:26:29,652 --> 00:26:30,636
Speaker 1: We had the argument.

423
00:26:30,696 --> 00:26:31,318
Speaker 1: I convinced you.

424
00:26:31,359 --> 00:26:32,946
Speaker 1: I showed you the fucking rule in the book.

425
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:33,710
Speaker 0: I don't remember this.

426
00:26:33,911 --> 00:26:35,037
Speaker 1: We didn't have this argument again.

427
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:36,362
Speaker 1: God damn, Scott.

428
00:26:36,402 --> 00:26:41,296
Speaker 0: The point is, I learned that you cannot score a goal.

429
00:26:41,657 --> 00:26:43,163
Speaker 0: See, you can score a goal in hockey.

430
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:45,132
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to kick the puck into the net.

431
00:26:45,152 --> 00:26:48,948
Speaker 1: There cannot be a distinct kicking motion by the offensive team.

432
00:26:48,968 --> 00:26:51,096
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to punch the puck into the net.

433
00:26:51,137 --> 00:26:53,246
Speaker 1: Nope, but you cannot throw it into the net.

434
00:26:53,267 --> 00:26:57,145
Speaker 0: You obviously can hit it with your stick into the net unless you hit it like above the waves.

435
00:26:57,185 --> 00:26:58,310
Speaker 0: Can't be a high stick, right?

436
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:02,610
Speaker 0: But you can always, if you shoot off your stick, you can bounce it off.

437
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:03,857
Speaker 0: Pretty much anything is the net.

438
00:27:03,877 --> 00:27:04,983
Speaker 0: You can bounce it off the goalie.

439
00:27:05,003 --> 00:27:06,130
Speaker 0: You can bounce it off a teammate.

440
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,237
Speaker 0: You can bounce it off an opponent.

441
00:27:07,257 --> 00:27:08,283
Speaker 0: You can bounce it off the skate.

442
00:27:08,323 --> 00:27:09,569
Speaker 0: You can bounce it off the post.

443
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:11,478
Speaker 0: You can maybe bounce it off the glass.

444
00:27:11,518 --> 00:27:14,449
Speaker 0: You can bounce the puck off pretty much anything.

445
00:27:14,490 --> 00:27:22,580
Speaker 0: As long as none of your teammates kick or punch it directly into the net and it counts as a goal, but there was something you cannot bounce it off of.

446
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,587
Speaker 0: that I learned because it happened.

447
00:27:25,089 --> 00:27:26,113
Speaker 1: I did not know this either.

448
00:27:26,233 --> 00:27:34,741
Speaker 0: Actually, someone in this video, you can watch, they bounce the puck off the ref and it goes in with a fluke and it does not count.

449
00:27:34,902 --> 00:27:36,327
Speaker 0: It's a pretty amazing bounce.

450
00:27:36,367 --> 00:27:38,033
Speaker 0: It does not count, but it's awesome.

451
00:27:38,395 --> 00:27:40,041
Speaker 1: I feel bad for the guy because...

452
00:27:40,262 --> 00:27:43,033
Speaker 0: Well, you know, every ref gets hit like once a year.

453
00:27:43,053 --> 00:27:47,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, but just the whole drama isn't playing out and meanwhile he's just there doing the like, "Oh, my

454
00:27:47,855 --> 00:27:48,036
Speaker 1: leg.".

455
00:27:48,056 --> 00:27:51,806
Speaker 0: Right, basically bounces off the ref's gut and then goes into the goal.

456
00:27:52,788 --> 00:27:55,053
Speaker 0: It doesn't count, but it's still awesome.

457
00:27:55,394 --> 00:27:59,023
Speaker 0: It's Book Club.

458
00:27:59,063 --> 00:28:01,652
Speaker 1: Book is still 2001 in Space Odyssey.

459
00:28:01,672 --> 00:28:02,073
Speaker 1: We've been busy.

460
00:28:02,434 --> 00:28:04,100
Speaker 1: We'll read it at some point.

461
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:04,622
Speaker 1: We're busy.

462
00:28:04,642 --> 00:28:05,365
Speaker 1: You should read it.

463
00:28:05,767 --> 00:28:06,692
Speaker 0: How many months has it been?

464
00:28:07,174 --> 00:28:07,938
Speaker 1: Well, we're busy.

465
00:28:07,998 --> 00:28:11,335
Speaker 0: So, someone should go back and see like how many months it took us to read each book.

466
00:28:11,355 --> 00:28:17,080
Speaker 0: and then the thing is, is like if you look at the actual time it takes from start reading to finish reading, it's like a few weeks.

467
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,472
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like very... It doesn't take me long to read a book.

468
00:28:19,492 --> 00:28:21,925
Speaker 0: It's just I don't start reading it because I'm doing all this other crap.

469
00:28:21,986 --> 00:28:22,227
Speaker 1: Yep.

470
00:28:23,291 --> 00:28:26,787
Speaker 1: Otherwise, you might have known we were just at PAX Unplugged where we did two panels.

471
00:28:27,329 --> 00:28:32,709
Speaker 1: One of them, the 40 Tabletop Games You Must Play, is on PAX's Twitch as a VOD.

472
00:28:32,729 --> 00:28:37,145
Speaker 1: You can just watch it with the slides and everything because we were in the biggest panel room.

473
00:28:37,406 --> 00:28:39,235
Speaker 1: So, they like live streamed it with all the stuff.

474
00:28:39,978 --> 00:28:45,381
Speaker 1: The other one, as soon as I have time, the Puerto Rico panel, the new one, I will get it up on YouTube to stay tuned.

475
00:28:45,823 --> 00:28:53,089
Speaker 1: We will be doing at least one panel, possibly two, at PAX South which is coming up not that long from now in January.

476
00:28:53,109 --> 00:28:57,988
Speaker 0: Right, and before PAX South, like a week or two before, is MAGFest.

477
00:28:58,028 --> 00:28:59,616
Speaker 1: Where we're doing like five panels.

478
00:28:59,636 --> 00:29:00,320
Speaker 0: It's gonna be great.

479
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,447
Speaker 0: Which is ridiculously soon.

480
00:29:03,548 --> 00:29:08,328
Speaker 0: It's pretty much New Year's, MAGFest, I think then a blank week, and then South, if I'm not mistaken.

481
00:29:08,529 --> 00:29:11,463
Speaker 1: And then a month after that, PAX East where we're doing at least one panel.

482
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,133
Speaker 0: But yeah, MAGFest comes right after New Year.

483
00:29:14,153 --> 00:29:15,398
Speaker 0: Today is December 12th.

484
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,285
Speaker 0: This is like two weeks.

485
00:29:17,486 --> 00:29:19,494
Speaker 1: My god, I got so many panels to write.

486
00:29:19,534 --> 00:29:23,653
Speaker 0: And also, just so you know, there's gonna be a bunch of holiday biz obviously in the United States.

487
00:29:23,673 --> 00:29:24,739
Speaker 1: Geek Nights will be spotty.

488
00:29:25,340 --> 00:29:31,803
Speaker 0: Most countries, right, there will not be a lot of content from us until, you know, post MAGFest, post South.

489
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:35,000
Speaker 1: There may be a lot of parallel content, like I'll do a bunch of live streams.

490
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:39,417
Speaker 0: I'm sure there will still be content, but do not expect any sort of regular schedule.

491
00:29:39,538 --> 00:29:41,426
Speaker 0: Expect lots of bailing on Geek Nights.

492
00:29:41,506 --> 00:29:42,691
Speaker 0: We almost bailed today.

493
00:29:43,313 --> 00:29:46,603
Speaker 1: I bailed on Monday because I do a work thing and we almost bailed.

494
00:29:47,044 --> 00:29:47,385
Speaker 1: We didn't.

495
00:29:47,465 --> 00:29:49,491
Speaker 1: We're here because we're gonna review.

496
00:29:49,511 --> 00:29:56,277
Speaker 1: So as we say often, you know, common tropes on Geek Nights are one, if an anime movie comes out, just go see it.

497
00:29:56,378 --> 00:29:58,727
Speaker 1: There aren't that many that aren't like Naruto.

498
00:29:58,747 --> 00:30:08,165
Speaker 0: If there is a full-length animated feature and it's, you know, it's usually, there's not a lot of those in the world made each year that are at, you know, top production value.

499
00:30:08,205 --> 00:30:10,978
Speaker 1: That aren't just one piece 50, the search for the second piece.

500
00:30:11,118 --> 00:30:17,101
Speaker 0: If you don't count all the ones that are one piece 50 or Pokemon 30 or, you know, compilation of some anime.

501
00:30:17,121 --> 00:30:25,523
Speaker 0: If you're talking about original theatrical animated feature films from Japan or from other countries, say Ireland.

502
00:30:27,107 --> 00:30:28,110
Speaker 1: Song of the Sea.

503
00:30:28,972 --> 00:30:30,777
Speaker 0: Or even the United States, right?

504
00:30:30,837 --> 00:30:35,713
Speaker 0: Not many of those are produced at the top levels of production value every year.

505
00:30:36,095 --> 00:30:39,887
Speaker 0: It's worth it to see pretty much all of them if you are a fan of animation.

506
00:30:40,248 --> 00:30:45,344
Speaker 0: So especially when they are made by a top name director studio.

507
00:30:45,905 --> 00:30:54,129
Speaker 0: So Mamoru Hosoda, who you may know from such films as that Digimon movie that people say is the good one that I haven't seen.

508
00:30:54,210 --> 00:30:56,802
Speaker 1: The one piece movie that's the good one that we did review.

509
00:30:56,982 --> 00:30:57,283
Speaker 0: Yes.

510
00:30:58,326 --> 00:30:59,891
Speaker 0: The Girl Who Leapt Through Time.

511
00:31:00,252 --> 00:31:00,974
Speaker 1: Summer Wars.

512
00:31:01,054 --> 00:31:02,017
Speaker 0: Wolf Children.

513
00:31:02,298 --> 00:31:03,040
Speaker 0: Boy and the Beast.

514
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,983
Speaker 0: Wolf Children.

515
00:31:04,003 --> 00:31:05,127
Speaker 1: Is that all of them?

516
00:31:05,167 --> 00:31:05,368
Speaker 1: Yeah.

517
00:31:05,428 --> 00:31:06,812
Speaker 1: Boy and the Beast.

518
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:07,494
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's it.

519
00:31:07,514 --> 00:31:10,043
Speaker 0: Is Boy and the Beast the last one we saw?

520
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:10,424
Speaker 0: Yeah.

521
00:31:10,665 --> 00:31:10,925
Speaker 0: Okay.

522
00:31:10,945 --> 00:31:12,531
Speaker 0: So anyways, new movie Mirai.

523
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:13,293
Speaker 0: no Mirai.

524
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:16,281
Speaker 0: Mirai of the Future, right?

525
00:31:16,341 --> 00:31:17,527
Speaker 0: The girl's name is Mirai.

526
00:31:17,547 --> 00:31:19,656
Speaker 1: You'll just see it as Mirai in most places.

527
00:31:19,757 --> 00:31:20,480
Speaker 0: It means future.

528
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:28,908
Speaker 0: It came out in Japan of July this year in the summer and it was released in the United States, limited theatrical release from G-Kids.

529
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:35,856
Speaker 1: The other thing we always say is that if you live in a major city in the US, like one of the five, every anime movie is just in the theaters.

530
00:31:35,937 --> 00:31:41,354
Speaker 0: It used to be that we would have to go to like, we actually saw Mamoru Hosoda in person.

531
00:31:41,715 --> 00:31:42,958
Speaker 0: when, was it Summer Wars?

532
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:44,183
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think so.

533
00:31:44,203 --> 00:31:45,671
Speaker 0: Yeah, they screened Summer Wars.

534
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:47,922
Speaker 1: Yeah, because the kids, all the kids were asking about King Kazuma.

535
00:31:48,043 --> 00:31:48,264
Speaker 0: Right.

536
00:31:48,324 --> 00:31:50,794
Speaker 0: It was like, it was the film festival.

537
00:31:50,995 --> 00:31:52,642
Speaker 0: They screened it at the director's guild.

538
00:31:52,723 --> 00:31:53,930
Speaker 0: We go there and Hosoda is there.

539
00:31:53,950 --> 00:31:55,339
Speaker 0: There's probably a Geeknet episode about it.

540
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:56,223
Speaker 1: There definitely is.

541
00:31:56,584 --> 00:32:06,059
Speaker 0: But the point is we used to have to do that to see this anime on the screen in the US, but now it seems like everything that G-Kids licenses is just in the local theater.

542
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,788
Speaker 0: We went to the theater in Astoria.

543
00:32:07,808 --> 00:32:09,437
Speaker 1: Yeah, just like a movie theater in Queens.

544
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:10,060
Speaker 0: On a Wednesday night.

545
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,786
Speaker 1: It's a normal movie theater.

546
00:32:11,967 --> 00:32:12,308
Speaker 1: Yeah.

547
00:32:12,449 --> 00:32:15,300
Speaker 0: And there it is because of what, the Fathom events, whatever.

548
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,228
Speaker 1: Subtitled, though the dub was on Saturday.

549
00:32:17,248 --> 00:32:19,901
Speaker 0: Well, Wednesday night was subtitled and Saturday was dubbed.

550
00:32:19,942 --> 00:32:21,368
Speaker 0: So, you know, you just took the schedule, right?

551
00:32:21,388 --> 00:32:24,784
Speaker 1: So the, the short version of our review is you should go see it.

552
00:32:24,864 --> 00:32:26,130
Speaker 1: And also Mamoru Hosoda.

553
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:27,678
Speaker 0: Even if it was bad, you should go see it.

554
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:30,470
Speaker 1: But Mamoru Hosoda is like, what, like?

555
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:31,595
Speaker 1: we're in a weird golden age.

556
00:32:31,775 --> 00:32:34,388
Speaker 1: He is one of several people who's just batting a thousand here.

557
00:32:34,589 --> 00:32:34,729
Speaker 0: Yeah.

558
00:32:34,750 --> 00:32:36,739
Speaker 0: Well, it's pretty much, you got a Makoto Shinkai.

559
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:37,241
Speaker 0: Yup.

560
00:32:37,281 --> 00:32:38,124
Speaker 0: You got a Hosoda.

561
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,328
Speaker 0: You had Satoshi Kon.

562
00:32:39,429 --> 00:32:40,793
Speaker 0: You had Satoshi Kon.

563
00:32:41,135 --> 00:32:42,660
Speaker 0: Miyazaki, I guess, is not retired.

564
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:43,783
Speaker 0: Yeah.

565
00:32:43,823 --> 00:32:46,311
Speaker 1: Not really batting a thousand, but batting like 980.

566
00:32:46,311 --> 00:32:46,612
Speaker 0: Right.

567
00:32:47,414 --> 00:32:55,078
Speaker 0: You know, and then I guess he got the studio Pawnuck, which is not, which not, not really batting a thousand, but they're batting.

568
00:32:55,882 --> 00:32:56,766
Speaker 0: They've had an at-bat.

569
00:32:56,927 --> 00:32:57,128
Speaker 0: Yeah.

570
00:32:57,169 --> 00:33:00,003
Speaker 0: And I guess production IG also puts something in there once in a while.

571
00:33:00,023 --> 00:33:00,123
Speaker 0: Right.

572
00:33:00,184 --> 00:33:00,425
Speaker 0: Yeah.

573
00:33:00,545 --> 00:33:00,806
Speaker 0: I see.

574
00:33:00,847 --> 00:33:01,590
Speaker 0: You know, they did.

575
00:33:01,871 --> 00:33:09,292
Speaker 0: And then we also got, um, um, you know, the, the walk-on girl, what's his name?

576
00:33:09,953 --> 00:33:10,595
Speaker 1: Oh, Yuasa.

577
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:10,796
Speaker 1: Yeah.

578
00:33:10,816 --> 00:33:12,099
Speaker 0: It's Masaki Yuasa.

579
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:12,560
Speaker 1: Yuasa.

580
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:15,470
Speaker 1: Yuasa is batting a thousand, but he's not playing baseball.

581
00:33:15,510 --> 00:33:18,100
Speaker 0: He's definitely playing Kalenball.

582
00:33:18,741 --> 00:33:22,536
Speaker 0: Anyway, but those are, those are your major anime directors these days.

583
00:33:22,577 --> 00:33:25,808
Speaker 0: Sadly, none of them are ladies, but anyway, but look at Hosoda.

584
00:33:26,511 --> 00:33:29,603
Speaker 1: He basically, he paid a Digimon movie that was actually good.

585
00:33:29,663 --> 00:33:31,835
Speaker 0: He made a one piece movie that was actually good.

586
00:33:31,855 --> 00:33:32,679
Speaker 0: People say it was good.

587
00:33:32,699 --> 00:33:37,276
Speaker 1: I haven't seen it, but I'm confident based on the people I know who said it's good anyway.

588
00:33:37,537 --> 00:33:40,410
Speaker 0: So the new movie he came out with is Mirai no Mirai.

589
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:41,998
Speaker 0: We went, we're like, Oh, let's go see that.

590
00:33:42,058 --> 00:33:42,400
Speaker 0: And we did.

591
00:33:43,001 --> 00:33:54,515
Speaker 0: So what it's, it's just, what it's about is about basically that same old cliche story of there's a kid in a family and the family has another baby, right?

592
00:33:54,555 --> 00:34:00,260
Speaker 0: He's got a new young sibling and there's this jealousy, you know, of like, Oh, my parents aren't paying enough attention to me.

593
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:02,869
Speaker 1: Because it literally happened.

594
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:04,595
Speaker 0: This is the oldest story in the book.

595
00:34:04,856 --> 00:34:07,930
Speaker 0: I've never experienced it myself, but I imagine other people do.

596
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:13,356
Speaker 0: Cause otherwise why would people tell this story if it didn't happen in any family, even though it didn't happen to my family.

597
00:34:13,757 --> 00:34:20,804
Speaker 0: So I can't really relate to it, but I've seen the story play out in so many different mediums over time that like, it's very familiar.

598
00:34:21,045 --> 00:34:21,909
Speaker 1: I've seen other people.

599
00:34:21,969 --> 00:34:24,420
Speaker 1: I know who have kids who have seen it play out live.

600
00:34:25,141 --> 00:34:25,362
Speaker 0: Yes.

601
00:34:25,562 --> 00:34:35,697
Speaker 0: And this, as you said, that core idea and expanded it into is this thing like 90 minutes to two hours, something under a full length animated feature film, 98 minutes.

602
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:45,875
Speaker 0: That is actually much the story it actually shows, even though that's the core of it is much grander, uh, than that one aspect.

603
00:34:45,956 --> 00:34:55,291
Speaker 1: I guess in general, it's, it's another, it's a very different movie in some ways from what he's done before, but in other ways, it's the same movie in that he's like all his movies.

604
00:34:55,913 --> 00:35:01,552
Speaker 1: They focus on like some idea of what a family is and do it especially really, really well.

605
00:35:01,572 --> 00:35:08,805
Speaker 0: Especially summer wars was about this big, awesome family and the sort of person who wasn't in the family coming to them for their, at their reunion time.

606
00:35:09,307 --> 00:35:09,548
Speaker 0: Right.

607
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,134
Speaker 1: Uh, what children's about?

608
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:12,660
Speaker 1: like a small isolated family.

609
00:35:12,821 --> 00:35:19,910
Speaker 0: I didn't see the wolf children, but the boy and the beast was about like, you know, it's got wolf children, I think is his best movie.

610
00:35:20,071 --> 00:35:20,372
Speaker 0: Maybe.

611
00:35:20,453 --> 00:35:20,915
Speaker 0: I haven't seen it.

612
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:21,397
Speaker 1: I don't know.

613
00:35:22,081 --> 00:35:23,268
Speaker 0: Uh, but boy and the beast, right.

614
00:35:23,308 --> 00:35:25,259
Speaker 0: It's sort of like about, you know, adoption, right?

615
00:35:25,279 --> 00:35:30,683
Speaker 1: Where it's like this adopted parent, but also parents that aren't great potentially and dysfunctional families.

616
00:35:30,823 --> 00:35:35,263
Speaker 0: All his movies are about a family in the same way that all Makoto Shinkai's movies are about clouds.

617
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:38,597
Speaker 1: But Mariah is interesting in that there's two ways to look at it.

618
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:55,551
Speaker 1: It is on one hand, a fantastical movie about a young child who meets his ancestors and his future self and his future sister when she grows up and has these experiences across space and time that are going to shape him into the person he's going to become.

619
00:35:56,234 --> 00:36:00,394
Speaker 1: But it's also a story where there are literally no fantastical elements whatsoever.

620
00:36:00,535 --> 00:36:15,923
Speaker 1: And it's the story of a kid who synthesizes the family photos and the stories that older relatives tell to each other with his own imagination and is shaped by those two experiences, those two things to become the person that he will be.

621
00:36:16,726 --> 00:36:35,876
Speaker 1: And all the fantastical experiences are literally just a child's animation seeded by like, you know, when you're a kid, like you hear the story grandma tells about that time grandpa shot somebody and you don't quite get it and you don't really understand, like what's going on, but you internalize it and you imagine things about it.

622
00:36:36,338 --> 00:36:40,737
Speaker 1: And those stories, like they impact your growth and development, whether or not you even realize it.

623
00:36:41,139 --> 00:36:42,163
Speaker 1: That's what this movie is about.

624
00:36:42,344 --> 00:36:42,485
Speaker 0: Right.

625
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:53,328
Speaker 0: The main center, the thing that I really liked about this movie a lot is that, you know, there are a lot of great American movies, old Hollywood movies especially that are based on plays.

626
00:36:53,549 --> 00:36:55,938
Speaker 0: For some reason, plays just become really great movies.

627
00:36:55,999 --> 00:36:56,984
Speaker 0: Like you can just go down the list.

628
00:36:57,004 --> 00:36:59,760
Speaker 0: There's like tons of amazing plays that became amazing movies.

629
00:36:59,780 --> 00:37:01,765
Speaker 0: You Chicago Cabaret.

630
00:37:02,006 --> 00:37:13,658
Speaker 0: They all start with C. But a lot of those great plays that became movies, say like a Twelve Angry Men or a Dial M for Murder, take place mostly in one room.

631
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:14,100
Speaker 1: Yep.

632
00:37:14,340 --> 00:37:14,581
Speaker 0: Right.

633
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:16,127
Speaker 0: I love those one rumors.

634
00:37:16,208 --> 00:37:16,429
Speaker 0: Right.

635
00:37:16,589 --> 00:37:17,453
Speaker 0: You got those.

636
00:37:17,513 --> 00:37:18,095
Speaker 0: What's that one?

637
00:37:18,437 --> 00:37:19,180
Speaker 0: Glass Menagerie.

638
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:19,901
Speaker 0: Nice.

639
00:37:20,102 --> 00:37:21,547
Speaker 0: Nice one rumor you got there.

640
00:37:21,567 --> 00:37:21,728
Speaker 0: Right.

641
00:37:21,768 --> 00:37:24,076
Speaker 0: I love the one room play movie things.

642
00:37:24,418 --> 00:37:25,060
Speaker 0: I just love those.

643
00:37:25,481 --> 00:37:28,932
Speaker 0: And this is not a one rumor, but it's a one house.

644
00:37:29,032 --> 00:37:30,798
Speaker 1: And it's a weird special house.

645
00:37:30,838 --> 00:37:30,999
Speaker 0: Yeah.

646
00:37:31,039 --> 00:37:34,870
Speaker 0: So you can tell part of this was important for the movie.

647
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:38,660
Speaker 0: And part of it was the animators slash designers.

648
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:45,180
Speaker 0: slash people were good at drawing, really having fun and really showing off and having a great time.

649
00:37:45,601 --> 00:37:54,990
Speaker 0: because in this movie, the dad is an architect and they have architected this amazing, super well-designed, super fancy house.

650
00:37:55,371 --> 00:37:56,314
Speaker 1: But it's a weird house.

651
00:37:56,334 --> 00:37:57,578
Speaker 0: That is very unusual.

652
00:37:57,698 --> 00:37:58,541
Speaker 0: Everyone knows it's weird.

653
00:37:58,562 --> 00:38:02,643
Speaker 0: In the same way like a Frank Lloyd Wright house is unusual, but this is more like a Japanese.

654
00:38:02,663 --> 00:38:05,110
Speaker 0: This is like if Muji and Flankroyd had a baby.

655
00:38:05,130 --> 00:38:08,119
Speaker 0: This is like that house.

656
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:10,129
Speaker 1: I would give almost anything to live in this house.

657
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:10,994
Speaker 0: This house is so good.

658
00:38:11,014 --> 00:38:13,367
Speaker 0: You could have been an architect instead of an IT person.

659
00:38:13,608 --> 00:38:13,869
Speaker 1: Yeah.

660
00:38:14,130 --> 00:38:15,175
Speaker 1: Like I would build this house.

661
00:38:15,215 --> 00:38:16,561
Speaker 1: I would hire someone to build this house for me.

662
00:38:17,525 --> 00:38:20,557
Speaker 0: The point of the house is that it is the main feature of it.

663
00:38:20,577 --> 00:38:26,019
Speaker 0: that's important for the movie is that there is a yard in the house and the yard is in the middle of the house.

664
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:30,717
Speaker 0: So it's like you're going from the, you know, it's like the kitchen bedroom area up top.

665
00:38:30,757 --> 00:38:32,022
Speaker 0: It sort of slants down.

666
00:38:32,423 --> 00:38:32,664
Speaker 0: Right.

667
00:38:33,005 --> 00:38:45,543
Speaker 0: And before you get to the front room where it's like closer to the entrance, there's just there's no ceiling and there's a patch of grass and there's a tree and the tree symbolizes the family tree.

668
00:38:46,125 --> 00:39:01,087
Speaker 0: And that is sort of, you know, what ties in all those, you know, imaginative, fantastical scenes where the kid is seeing his, you know, future or past relatives or self, right, is all through this tree.

669
00:39:01,167 --> 00:39:07,932
Speaker 0: This tree is sort of like a magical connection to the actual family tree, which really like it fits the like.

670
00:39:07,972 --> 00:39:14,316
Speaker 1: just as a kid, like you'd go into the yard and when you're a kid, the yard feels way bigger than the yard actually is in the real world.

671
00:39:14,758 --> 00:39:14,919
Speaker 0: Right.

672
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:16,626
Speaker 1: And you just have adventures in this yard.

673
00:39:16,827 --> 00:39:25,745
Speaker 0: So it's kind of interesting because on the one hand, it sort of plays this role in having this cool, fancy architecture and cool house for them to stage their play in.

674
00:39:26,046 --> 00:39:26,327
Speaker 0: Right.

675
00:39:26,709 --> 00:39:27,713
Speaker 0: It's a lot of fun to draw.

676
00:39:27,793 --> 00:39:28,617
Speaker 0: I imagine they did.

677
00:39:28,797 --> 00:39:32,935
Speaker 0: You could tell there's a lot of parts where they're sort of, you know, really getting off on like this.

678
00:39:33,096 --> 00:39:38,960
Speaker 0: The opening scene has the kid like blowing on the glass and then wiping it away and blowing on it and wiping it away.

679
00:39:39,141 --> 00:39:42,354
Speaker 0: And they're like, check how fancy we can do this.

680
00:39:42,415 --> 00:39:43,218
Speaker 0: I'm like watching that.

681
00:39:43,278 --> 00:39:45,249
Speaker 0: And I'm like, how much time did someone spend on that?

682
00:39:45,389 --> 00:39:50,092
Speaker 1: All those big painting shots with those giant painted backgrounds and all that nonsense.

683
00:39:50,112 --> 00:39:52,562
Speaker 0: They put a lot of money and time into this animation.

684
00:39:52,622 --> 00:39:52,903
Speaker 0: Right.

685
00:39:53,545 --> 00:39:56,233
Speaker 0: But anyway, but also.

686
00:39:56,615 --> 00:39:56,795
Speaker 0: Right.

687
00:39:56,855 --> 00:40:01,512
Speaker 0: It's like it wouldn't make a lot of sense for the kid to say, go outside where a tree was.

688
00:40:01,532 --> 00:40:02,174
Speaker 0: Right.

689
00:40:02,194 --> 00:40:04,743
Speaker 0: You know, it's like having that tree in middle of the house.

690
00:40:05,405 --> 00:40:09,920
Speaker 0: really like makes the story possible to tell the story in the way they want to.

691
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:16,826
Speaker 1: I think the kid would retreat to the yard in the same way that a real child would retreat into like their imagination.

692
00:40:16,846 --> 00:40:18,755
Speaker 0: There's a couple scenes outside the house.

693
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:20,924
Speaker 0: I think really goes biking and stuff like that.

694
00:40:20,964 --> 00:40:22,710
Speaker 0: Or like maybe in the cars a little bit.

695
00:40:23,092 --> 00:40:26,423
Speaker 0: But ninety, ninety plus percent is in the is in the house.

696
00:40:26,845 --> 00:40:27,005
Speaker 0: Right.

697
00:40:27,025 --> 00:40:27,728
Speaker 0: In the different rooms.

698
00:40:28,530 --> 00:40:39,949
Speaker 1: So the like basically the where it kicks off, where it goes from just being a story about a family to getting this semi fantastical or not, depending how you read it, thing is right away.

699
00:40:39,969 --> 00:40:49,160
Speaker 1: The dog is jealous of the baby, too, because the dog, which happens with pets, was jealous of the of the first kid when he was born.

700
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:52,674
Speaker 0: Yeah, the dog has been in the family longer than either of the children.

701
00:40:52,996 --> 00:40:56,272
Speaker 1: And it set that up and basically like not really really spoilers.

702
00:40:56,292 --> 00:40:59,230
Speaker 1: We're going to avoid talking about the details of the rest of the movie because just watch a fucking movie.

703
00:40:59,271 --> 00:40:59,613
Speaker 1: It's good.

704
00:40:59,774 --> 00:41:00,298
Speaker 0: It's only 90 minutes.

705
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,161
Speaker 0: Yeah.

706
00:41:01,202 --> 00:41:02,166
Speaker 1: Ninety eight minutes to spend.

707
00:41:02,186 --> 00:41:03,050
Speaker 1: You should watch this movie.

708
00:41:03,452 --> 00:41:10,236
Speaker 0: But the kid is actually going to be available to watch outside the theater at home pretty soon, slash easily.

709
00:41:10,296 --> 00:41:19,212
Speaker 1: So the kid is sort of freaking out about the baby and he goes off to the yard and then suddenly like the yard is a giant palace and it's run down and decayed.

710
00:41:19,533 --> 00:41:20,296
Speaker 1: and he meets this.

711
00:41:20,477 --> 00:41:20,718
Speaker 0: Right.

712
00:41:20,738 --> 00:41:20,838
Speaker 0: Right.

713
00:41:20,858 --> 00:41:22,045
Speaker 0: It's like I didn't know what's going on.

714
00:41:22,085 --> 00:41:24,520
Speaker 0: I thought I'm like, oh, it's another travel to a different world.

715
00:41:25,321 --> 00:41:27,390
Speaker 0: Like I've seen a thousand of these.

716
00:41:27,470 --> 00:41:28,636
Speaker 0: Well, all right, whatever.

717
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:29,038
Speaker 0: I'm here.

718
00:41:29,118 --> 00:41:29,500
Speaker 0: I'll watch.

719
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:36,827
Speaker 1: And he meets what appears for a second to be a regal prince who then very rapidly appears to be very shabby and self-entitled.

720
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:37,088
Speaker 1: Right.

721
00:41:37,148 --> 00:41:42,449
Speaker 0: And then it like pretty much right before the characters said they were the dog.

722
00:41:42,530 --> 00:41:43,575
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, it's the dog.

723
00:41:43,716 --> 00:41:43,917
Speaker 0: Yep.

724
00:41:43,977 --> 00:41:45,684
Speaker 0: And then he's like, oh, I'm the dog.

725
00:41:46,085 --> 00:41:47,892
Speaker 1: I used to be the prince of this house.

726
00:41:48,293 --> 00:41:52,710
Speaker 1: And then I was usurped by this right before he said that line.

727
00:41:52,751 --> 00:41:53,735
Speaker 0: I'm like, oh, it's the dog.

728
00:41:53,795 --> 00:41:55,644
Speaker 0: And then he says, I used to be prince of this house.

729
00:41:55,705 --> 00:41:56,570
Speaker 0: And I'm like, I am right.

730
00:41:56,731 --> 00:42:02,156
Speaker 1: But the movie does something really great in that the dog, like you see the dog and the dog acts like a real dog and the dog seems cute.

731
00:42:02,578 --> 00:42:12,033
Speaker 1: But after you meet the prince and realize that the prince is this personification of the dog, then every time you see the dog after that, the dog kind of has stubble.

732
00:42:12,073 --> 00:42:16,172
Speaker 1: And you just imagine the dog is this kind of like grumpy, shabby older dude.

733
00:42:16,473 --> 00:42:16,674
Speaker 0: Right.

734
00:42:16,714 --> 00:42:16,875
Speaker 0: Right.

735
00:42:16,895 --> 00:42:23,762
Speaker 0: It's like they enter, you know, even though the dog is a dog by introducing this personification of the dog in this one brief scene.

736
00:42:24,224 --> 00:42:27,097
Speaker 0: And then, you know, it's not really there a lot for the rest of the movie.

737
00:42:27,157 --> 00:42:30,430
Speaker 0: It's just as one imaginative scene with the kid, mostly, you know.

738
00:42:30,470 --> 00:42:34,344
Speaker 0: But then now this dog you gave managed to give it this human personality.

739
00:42:34,364 --> 00:42:35,047
Speaker 0: Right.

740
00:42:35,348 --> 00:42:38,499
Speaker 0: Without having to do like some sort of Snoopy kind of thing.

741
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:38,840
Speaker 1: Yep.

742
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,181
Speaker 1: Right.

743
00:42:39,443 --> 00:42:48,279
Speaker 1: And bit by bit, the movie just introduces like it goes through these scenes of the dog and a couple other like incidents like that, that flesh out the growth of this child.

744
00:42:48,339 --> 00:42:57,504
Speaker 1: And it basically culminates in a very well done child's nightmare scenario, like literally the kind of nightmare a kid would have.

745
00:42:57,604 --> 00:42:57,745
Speaker 1: Right.

746
00:42:58,006 --> 00:43:08,682
Speaker 0: So the subplot of this movie, the main subplot is the relationship between the two parents, because basically it was a situation where, you know, it's Japan, first of all.

747
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:09,064
Speaker 0: Right.

748
00:43:09,144 --> 00:43:13,499
Speaker 0: So, you know, the working culture of Japan got to incorporate that.

749
00:43:13,519 --> 00:43:13,740
Speaker 0: Yep.

750
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:15,746
Speaker 1: But the mom is the executive.

751
00:43:15,826 --> 00:43:16,007
Speaker 0: Right.

752
00:43:16,067 --> 00:43:19,198
Speaker 0: The mom was at home and the dad was out.

753
00:43:19,238 --> 00:43:23,574
Speaker 0: But now that they had the second baby, the dad is now home and the mom goes to work.

754
00:43:23,855 --> 00:43:24,036
Speaker 0: Right.

755
00:43:24,056 --> 00:43:26,787
Speaker 0: And the dad is freelancing architect from home with his laptop.

756
00:43:26,927 --> 00:43:27,148
Speaker 0: Right.

757
00:43:27,389 --> 00:43:32,089
Speaker 0: And now he's got to take care of the baby and take care of the kid and do all the housey shit.

758
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:32,711
Speaker 0: Right.

759
00:43:32,912 --> 00:43:34,859
Speaker 0: You know, it seems he's got a little bit of a Mr.

760
00:43:35,060 --> 00:43:36,005
Speaker 1: Mom situation.

761
00:43:36,065 --> 00:43:38,236
Speaker 1: If any of you are young enough to have seen the movie Mr.

762
00:43:38,276 --> 00:43:39,100
Speaker 1: Mom with Michael Keaton.

763
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:39,501
Speaker 0: Right.

764
00:43:39,521 --> 00:43:41,469
Speaker 0: It does, but it's not a comedic way.

765
00:43:41,489 --> 00:43:43,035
Speaker 0: It's presented in a realistic way.

766
00:43:43,175 --> 00:43:51,645
Speaker 0: And the two parents, they have a very adult and realistic, you know, sort of conflict resolution and dealing with their relationship thing.

767
00:43:51,946 --> 00:43:53,232
Speaker 0: That's like, it's so real.

768
00:43:53,332 --> 00:43:58,294
Speaker 0: It's not, you know, there's nothing corny about it or, you know, none of them are stupid about it.

769
00:43:58,354 --> 00:43:58,555
Speaker 0: Right.

770
00:43:58,575 --> 00:44:01,227
Speaker 0: It's like they talk to each other and get their shit in order.

771
00:44:01,287 --> 00:44:08,414
Speaker 0: the way adults do in the real world, reasonable adults do who are intelligent, nondramatic, real adults in the real world.

772
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:09,458
Speaker 0: Right.

773
00:44:09,498 --> 00:44:19,738
Speaker 0: They get their shit together and you see them get their shit together, you know, and talk about whether they're good parents and, you know, how their relationship is and all that kind of stuff together.

774
00:44:19,758 --> 00:44:21,323
Speaker 0: And that's really nice to see.

775
00:44:21,644 --> 00:44:31,695
Speaker 0: And it's also good for adults, perhaps who are parents, you know, or were parents or whatever could go and connect with that part of the movie as well.

776
00:44:31,756 --> 00:44:34,565
Speaker 0: It's not just the, you know, kid jealousy part.

777
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:38,517
Speaker 1: So you like, this is a must see anime movie.

778
00:44:38,537 --> 00:44:40,343
Speaker 1: And I don't like, I don't want to say anything else.

779
00:44:40,383 --> 00:44:43,232
Speaker 0: Just Japan anime movie 2018.

780
00:44:43,232 --> 00:44:45,138
Speaker 0: What other probably what else came out 2018?

781
00:44:45,138 --> 00:44:47,648
Speaker 0: That was a movie that was animated from Japan.

782
00:44:47,688 --> 00:44:48,371
Speaker 1: I think it's this.

783
00:44:48,733 --> 00:44:48,974
Speaker 0: Yes.

784
00:44:49,155 --> 00:44:50,159
Speaker 1: I think it's definitely this.

785
00:44:50,179 --> 00:44:50,762
Speaker 0: I think it is.

786
00:44:50,782 --> 00:44:52,190
Speaker 0: I can't remember another one.

787
00:44:52,230 --> 00:44:52,833
Speaker 0: I could be wrong.

788
00:44:53,014 --> 00:44:53,658
Speaker 0: Call me out on it.

789
00:44:53,778 --> 00:44:53,959
