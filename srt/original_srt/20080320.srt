1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:11,706
Speaker 1: It's Thursday March 20th.

2
00:00:12,128 --> 00:00:16,239
Speaker 1: I'm rim and I'm Emily and this is geek night tonight.

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,100
Speaker 1: We talk about what it's really like to be an animator and getting into animation.

4
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:26,927
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:32,203 --> 00:00:43,796
Speaker 1: Well, this should be a somewhat different episode of geek nights from what you're used to because as Scott said last night He's off bowling with co-workers And so in place of Scott, you've got your own personal headphone.

6
00:00:43,836 --> 00:00:44,660
Speaker 0: was me Emily.

7
00:00:45,542 --> 00:00:52,140
Speaker 0: You might know me as go me dog from the forums but for all you new listeners I am like the one-person studio audience.

8
00:00:52,623 --> 00:01:00,300
Speaker 0: I'm usually in the room when they're recording the show But you never hear my voice except for an occasional like fit of hilarity in the background.

9
00:01:01,185 --> 00:01:02,300
Speaker 1: Well, we've actually talked about this.

10
00:01:02,444 --> 00:01:02,960
Speaker 1: It's kind of weird.

11
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:14,885
Speaker 1: Oh when we it's hard to do like humor or anything even when there's like two people without kind of an audience to bounce off of We can always tell the show is usually funnier when Emily's in the room because we can kind of tell me.

12
00:01:19,964 --> 00:01:28,700
Speaker 0: But the thing is it's so hard because when they get really funny I'm like terrified that I'm gonna ruin a take or something and that they're gonna have to like start editing the shot.

13
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,247
Speaker 1: I'm like, oh my god, I laughed.

14
00:01:30,307 --> 00:01:30,890
Speaker 0: I'm so sorry.

15
00:01:30,910 --> 00:01:32,035
Speaker 0: They're like, no, that's good.

16
00:01:32,096 --> 00:01:32,960
Speaker 0: That means we're funny.

17
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:35,950
Speaker 1: Ah, but you see there's the magic of the noise gate.

18
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:48,480
Speaker 0: Well, actually the downward expander if you want to be fancy Yeah, but so anyway This actually been been on the forums a lot lately and you probably know me my handle go me dog.

19
00:01:48,560 --> 00:02:00,155
Speaker 0: And actually it's funny because I was never a big forum person until recently and I've finally come to Understand why trolls become trolls, isn't it?

20
00:02:00,235 --> 00:02:00,496
Speaker 1: Really?

21
00:02:00,537 --> 00:02:01,240
Speaker 1: It's scary.

22
00:02:01,501 --> 00:02:03,308
Speaker 0: It's like, you know cuz cuz.

23
00:02:03,348 --> 00:02:04,292
Speaker 0: I found I'm not

24
00:02:04,452 --> 00:02:04,653
Speaker 1: like

25
00:02:04,713 --> 00:02:18,640
Speaker 0: playing devil's advocate or anything But I found that when there's a flame war and this this arguments coming I'll just go and I'll be a lot more Incendiary and radical than I usually am and be like, okay, let's take this match and just chuck it onto the lighter food.

26
00:02:20,863 --> 00:02:23,535
Speaker 0: I know right and so it's kind of like this stuff.

27
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:28,876
Speaker 0: like like with cooking I would always be like why do we always eat boring food and then I move into my own apartment?

28
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,843
Speaker 0: I'm like damn I'm tired.

29
00:02:31,103 --> 00:02:34,273
Speaker 0: I don't have time to cook and then it's like oh, I'm sorry.

30
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,700
Speaker 0: I ever complained about boring ham.

31
00:02:36,923 --> 00:02:37,760
Speaker 0: Blah blah blah.

32
00:02:39,982 --> 00:02:40,906
Speaker 1: Take it to the next level.

33
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:43,918
Speaker 1: I mean I was a semi-professional troll on farm.

34
00:02:43,938 --> 00:02:53,979
Speaker 0: Well, no, no I don't think I'll ever go that far, you know, I at least have some sympathy for for the people I argue with Yeah, you have that except that one person, you know who you are.

35
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,231
Speaker 1: You haven't attained that level where you actually it's.

36
00:02:57,311 --> 00:03:00,784
Speaker 1: it's like it's so impersonal that you don't even consider The issue.

37
00:03:01,045 --> 00:03:04,440
Speaker 1: you don't even consider who the other person is or even what they said.

38
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,395
Speaker 1: Well, all you do is type something invective and then wait for the fireworks.

39
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:10,459
Speaker 0: That's it explode.

40
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:15,240
Speaker 0: Well, I I used to take stuff really personally on the forums that I remember.

41
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:21,668
Speaker 0: There was this one listener Killar knee and I actually I still listen I think felt really bad cuz a long time ago.

42
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:25,220
Speaker 0: I like yelled at him be like, why do you always get so argumentative?

43
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:33,422
Speaker 0: Leave Riven Scott's pronunciation alone, and I actually got like like, you know all uppity Adam Like.

44
00:03:33,442 --> 00:03:37,800
Speaker 0: in retrospect I was like man, but that is not how things work on the internet.

45
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,087
Speaker 0: You know, of course very bad about that.

46
00:03:40,107 --> 00:03:45,699
Speaker 1: Gomi dog is also somewhat famous on the forums for drawing certain Art shall we say?

47
00:03:48,644 --> 00:03:58,620
Speaker 0: I drew those at work and and then like, you know It was it was just I I was animating and you know got around lunchtime and I was like, man I need to take a break from the 3d stuff.

48
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:03,353
Speaker 0: And so when that happens, I'll I'll get out the tablet and start sketching in Photoshop.

49
00:04:03,855 --> 00:04:09,415
Speaker 0: and I was like, oh bands I know what would like make the fangirls flip out.

50
00:04:09,576 --> 00:04:10,319
Speaker 0: I'm gonna do it.

51
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:15,934
Speaker 0: Well, we're having like a conversation about like moe girls or something.

52
00:04:15,954 --> 00:04:16,656
Speaker 0: So no way.

53
00:04:16,676 --> 00:04:18,889
Speaker 1: girls have been coming up a lot lately I don't know.

54
00:04:18,950 --> 00:04:22,990
Speaker 1: I don't know In the world, there's just more moe girls left and right.

55
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:31,735
Speaker 0: I I don't know what put this Twisted idea to my little noggin here, but I was like, I'm going to do it's.

56
00:04:31,775 --> 00:04:42,300
Speaker 0: probably I was thinking like, you know Our friend was talking about drawing Some video game characters and and you'll find out later which video game characters because it's pretty hilarious.

57
00:04:42,822 --> 00:04:53,713
Speaker 0: but let's let's just say, you know, they're more of the PC gaming FPS end of things as as cute moe girls and like the Pokemon drawn as moe girls.

58
00:04:53,774 --> 00:04:57,229
Speaker 0: and it seems like the the rage today is To draw.

59
00:04:57,289 --> 00:04:58,700
Speaker 0: everything is cute boy girl.

60
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:04,160
Speaker 0: So I'm like, I'm going to take rim and Scott and mollify them terribly.

61
00:05:05,223 --> 00:05:12,856
Speaker 1: All you need to do to complete this sort of circle of life is to take our moe girls and turn them into some sort Of Mecha Musume.

62
00:05:13,058 --> 00:05:15,874
Speaker 1: Oh Tatsu will be the most conflicted person.

63
00:05:15,934 --> 00:05:19,311
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah You make you're gonna make.

64
00:05:19,351 --> 00:05:25,657
Speaker 0: him will be like one of those Like Nakatsu from Hana Kimi where it's like oh, oh, okay.

65
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:26,479
Speaker 0: What's going on?

66
00:05:27,942 --> 00:05:34,155
Speaker 0: If you haven't read or watched Hana Kimi, I actually really recommend it.

67
00:05:34,296 --> 00:05:46,094
Speaker 1: it's it's a it's a very funny show but For all of you who are uninitiated I don't know how many new listeners will suddenly randomly stumble upon this episode.

68
00:05:46,194 --> 00:05:54,740
Speaker 1: first of all episodes because Since Katsu khan we haven't really promoted and we're not going to until this summer and we go to every freaking convention in the world.

69
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,219
Speaker 0: Oh my god, we've got the the line up there.

70
00:05:57,621 --> 00:06:04,500
Speaker 1: But this is a slightly special episode and that my our normal co-host Scott is as you know bowling with co-workers.

71
00:06:04,801 --> 00:06:06,206
Speaker 1: I don't know when he's gonna be.

72
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:12,709
Speaker 0: you know, when you think about it, that's one of those old men kind of things like yeah I'm going bowling with the guys from work.

73
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,733
Speaker 0: It's like my god.

74
00:06:13,773 --> 00:06:15,460
Speaker 0: We've gotten to that age haven't we?

75
00:06:16,363 --> 00:06:17,688
Speaker 1: Up until my current job.

76
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:20,920
Speaker 1: I never would have even considered doing anything with most Michael.

77
00:06:21,241 --> 00:06:31,150
Speaker 1: Well, I take that back because some of the people at IBM were cool, but I worked in a really small like cool department the hospital Yeah, but now we work at a cool company.

78
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:33,420
Speaker 1: your company kicks ass, you know, I'm curious.

79
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:36,659
Speaker 1: This is just a total aside, but I wonder do any of you out there?

80
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,427
Speaker 1: Did any of you work at that hospital?

81
00:06:39,467 --> 00:06:45,571
Speaker 1: because I sent an email out to pretty much everyone who worked there like basically Yeah, screw you all thanks for the fish.

82
00:06:45,872 --> 00:06:47,379
Speaker 1: Oh and by the way, I do this radio show.

83
00:06:51,482 --> 00:06:58,891
Speaker 0: I knew you walked out with finger held high, but I did not know that you Promoted yourself at the same time.

84
00:06:58,951 --> 00:07:00,760
Speaker 1: It's like fuck you and listen to kick nights.

85
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,192
Speaker 1: That was the proudest and highest finger that has ever been raised by ran you were.

86
00:07:05,312 --> 00:07:18,340
Speaker 1: you were pretty pretty pumped about that like freedom Yonkers, you know, see I could yell freedom like Mel Gibson, but without the the bad stuff.

87
00:07:18,420 --> 00:07:22,996
Speaker 1: Yeah without the torture, but I do have a little bit of news because this is a rare moment.

88
00:07:23,036 --> 00:07:27,258
Speaker 1: I can talk about politics without having Scott here to go.

89
00:07:32,722 --> 00:07:34,960
Speaker 1: Nothing no, no, no, oh this Obama business.

90
00:07:35,082 --> 00:07:36,360
Speaker 1: I just want people to be quiet.

91
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:43,565
Speaker 0: The thing is he gets really ticked at us when we don't know the absolute latest like up-to-date Stuff in tech news.

92
00:07:43,826 --> 00:07:45,393
Speaker 0: He's like what you didn't know.

93
00:07:45,454 --> 00:07:46,860
Speaker 0: such-and-such gadget came out.

94
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:51,715
Speaker 0: You're crazy and we're like, well, this is actually stuff that can affect your life Scott.

95
00:07:51,756 --> 00:07:54,185
Speaker 0: He's like it won't affect me Nothing affects me.

96
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,816
Speaker 1: What he always says is it hasn't affected my life yet.

97
00:07:57,138 --> 00:08:00,106
Speaker 0: Well, um Recession Bush etc.

98
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:04,080
Speaker 0: He hears me complain about Bush and then he's like, uh, well actually it has affected him.

99
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,943
Speaker 1: He has admitted this.

100
00:08:04,963 --> 00:08:10,180
Speaker 1: he always says that it affects me because everyone around me is constantly yelling about it.

101
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, he listens to me gripe about it.

102
00:08:14,081 --> 00:08:14,984
Speaker 0: You know how like.

103
00:08:15,566 --> 00:08:27,679
Speaker 0: he was sad because I always draw when I draw caricatures of rim and Scott I always draw rim happy and Scott is kind of like scally and and I think he felt kind of booed about that He's like I smile.

104
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:35,330
Speaker 0: Buddy caricatures Scott as Grouchy and I think it's partly like a balance thing cuz.

105
00:08:35,410 --> 00:08:49,274
Speaker 0: on one hand you've got like it's kind of like the tragedy in comedy Mass for Greek theater and on one hand you've got like really smiley hyper rim and on the other hand You've got Scott who's kind of surly And he said, you know, I I smile.

106
00:08:49,334 --> 00:08:51,020
Speaker 0: Why do you always draw me angry?

107
00:08:51,220 --> 00:09:00,000
Speaker 1: And I was like, I don't know I look back like all the geek nights art We've had pretty much forever and even back to like our earliest earliest logos and banners.

108
00:09:00,664 --> 00:09:03,238
Speaker 1: Scott is grouchy and usually full of stubble.

109
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:09,005
Speaker 0: My favorite one still was was art boy our friend Adam.

110
00:09:09,025 --> 00:09:21,977
Speaker 0: he drew a Caricature of the whole crew and actually I liked mine too because I was like in the background Going wild and I had like these really round eyes like whee and I was like, yeah that pretty much captures it.

111
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:29,515
Speaker 0: but Scott was sitting in a corner typing on his laptop and thinking of a penis and I was like, yeah, that's got for ya.

112
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:32,011
Speaker 0: I Love Scott though.

113
00:09:32,052 --> 00:09:35,127
Speaker 0: He's Sometimes we butt heads cuz.

114
00:09:35,388 --> 00:09:43,840
Speaker 1: actually oh, yeah sometimes but you know It's not just you and Scott is it's pretty much everyone and Scott except to a large degree me.

115
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:47,956
Speaker 1: But that's partly because as far as I've been told I'm the most laid-back human being on earth.

116
00:09:48,136 --> 00:09:49,000
Speaker 0: You have no idea.

117
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:53,012
Speaker 0: Okay rim is egotistical, but he's like the most patient.

118
00:09:53,032 --> 00:10:03,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, you are you are but Much like confidence as he debates murdering his uncle to take control of the Empire.

119
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,686
Speaker 0: I I don't get it.

120
00:10:05,108 --> 00:10:06,995
Speaker 1: I don't think I'm gonna commit patricide just yet though.

121
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:08,080
Speaker 0: You shouldn't.

122
00:10:08,742 --> 00:10:11,120
Speaker 1: I'm all about the hubris anyway.

123
00:10:12,101 --> 00:10:15,352
Speaker 0: What I was gonna say is he is the patient person like it's.

124
00:10:15,452 --> 00:10:17,660
Speaker 1: it's like unless I'm hungry.

125
00:10:18,021 --> 00:10:22,680
Speaker 0: Yes, when you're hungry, but even then you only get mildly like I don't know impatient.

126
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:29,757
Speaker 0: Well, not quite that bad but this guy he's great to deal with.

127
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:32,060
Speaker 1: but well I don't know.

128
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:36,880
Speaker 1: I've ever told the story on the show of how Scott and I came to be roommates because it was actually a very mundane.

129
00:10:37,121 --> 00:10:40,834
Speaker 0: This is gonna be like the gripe about Scott show because I don't want in on that.

130
00:10:40,954 --> 00:10:42,700
Speaker 0: I'm like happy at Scott lately.

131
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,344
Speaker 1: Oh, I am too.

132
00:10:43,384 --> 00:10:45,596
Speaker 1: It's a funny story and Scott actually agrees.

133
00:10:45,637 --> 00:10:53,434
Speaker 1: It's funny too and we might have told it before me Scott Alex and Probably the only person who's ever removed themselves from the front row crew.

134
00:10:53,675 --> 00:10:55,240
Speaker 0: Oh, may he rest in peace.

135
00:10:55,783 --> 00:10:58,860
Speaker 1: Yeah, he is dead to us or something.

136
00:10:59,606 --> 00:11:01,018
Speaker 1: But no the four of us are gonna.

137
00:11:01,038 --> 00:11:13,203
Speaker 1: you know We got we want an apartment together and there's this crazy lottery at RIT because there's no housing and we go in And we were walking up and we discover that the last four-person apartment other than the nasty ones at River Knoll We're gone.

138
00:11:13,344 --> 00:11:15,151
Speaker 1: Oh, man, and we're like damn it.

139
00:11:15,513 --> 00:11:24,713
Speaker 1: All right, we're gonna have to live in the crap Oh apartments and this is gonna and then someone yells Hey, I got two one-bedroom two-person colonies left.

140
00:11:25,034 --> 00:11:25,736
Speaker 1: anyone want him?

141
00:11:25,756 --> 00:11:26,820
Speaker 1: and we were at the front of the line.

142
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:32,390
Speaker 1: Oh, we all look at each other and we all go Oh, and then Alex says who's gonna live with Scott?

143
00:11:32,731 --> 00:11:35,340
Speaker 1: and everyone looks at each other and there's this moment of silence.

144
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,950
Speaker 0: I can see Alex saying that and Scott's like what.

145
00:11:39,351 --> 00:11:45,570
Speaker 1: and I said I'll live with him because I'm probably the only person who will Not murder him and and it's probably true.

146
00:11:46,252 --> 00:11:47,637
Speaker 0: I have lived with Scott.

147
00:11:47,737 --> 00:11:50,532
Speaker 0: I can attest to this I never actually tried to murder him.

148
00:11:50,612 --> 00:11:51,176
Speaker 0: I tried to.

149
00:11:52,223 --> 00:11:59,700
Speaker 0: Only one member of the front row crew has ever tried to murder Where I went for him and it might have gone into violence if I had actually got there.

150
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:16,750
Speaker 0: But I slipped on the kitchen floor and fell smack on my butt and I was like, oh my butt Kind of changed from like violence to comedy immediately and it was kind of like One person has actually tried to kill Scott and it wasn't you.

151
00:12:16,951 --> 00:12:19,500
Speaker 0: so yeah, I'll leave that distinction for so.

152
00:12:24,844 --> 00:12:33,900
Speaker 1: So Obama Obama So much to say but I don't want to do a whole episode on just me talking about politics because I can record that by Myself, I don't need anyone else here.

153
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:37,140
Speaker 1: I could just go and I feel of this way about this issue.

154
00:12:39,181 --> 00:12:41,173
Speaker 1: John McCain is a giant twat.

155
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:41,676
Speaker 1: Not really.

156
00:12:41,696 --> 00:12:50,376
Speaker 0: He's not that bad You know, that's like my parents though talking about politics to people who agree with you It's like you talk about priests into the choir.

157
00:12:50,557 --> 00:12:51,321
Speaker 1: everyone agree Like.

158
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:55,660
Speaker 1: I know a lot of our listeners agree with me and like yeah Obama and all that stuff.

159
00:12:55,740 --> 00:13:01,300
Speaker 1: But I don't think a lot of them agree with my political stances as opposed to my issue and politician stance.

160
00:13:01,521 --> 00:13:08,639
Speaker 0: I don't always agree with your political stances, but Well, technically I'm an anti-federalist because I'm for federalism.

161
00:13:09,666 --> 00:13:10,552
Speaker 1: That's America for you.

162
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:11,559
Speaker 1: But alright, here's the deal.

163
00:13:12,201 --> 00:13:24,008
Speaker 1: Obama's up by enough pledge delegates and he's poached enough of Hillary's super delegates to where pretty much unless Hillary like Absolutely demolishes him in Pennsylvania.

164
00:13:24,028 --> 00:13:27,280
Speaker 1: I don't see any chance of her getting the nomination.

165
00:13:27,381 --> 00:14:02,269
Speaker 1: I think Obama is definitely going to be the next president of the United States and the cool thing is it kind of it's weird how it came down to Michigan and Florida because Michigan and Florida both went for Hillary partly because Obama took his name off the ballot in Michigan and actually didn't campaign in either state and Hillary kind of left her name on the ballot and campaign a little bit and then now she's even campaigning on the deal that she's going to reinstate their votes and How those votes for her should count even though in Michigan Obama wasn't even on the ballot.

166
00:14:02,289 --> 00:14:05,630
Speaker 0: man What is up with Florida always messing stuff up?

167
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,570
Speaker 0: It seems like every time we have an election Florida is just like a major like clusterfuck.

168
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,260
Speaker 1: Well, see actually the real problem is Ohio.

169
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,949
Speaker 1: Ohio has more election problems than any other state.

170
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:22,088
Speaker 0: I know it's always and isn't it like kind of the swing vote thing where if Ohio goes one way.

171
00:14:22,188 --> 00:14:22,690
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

172
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:24,655
Speaker 1: But it's weird.

173
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:25,498
Speaker 1: I actually had to.

174
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:28,569
Speaker 1: very seriously thing is I came to this conclusion right away.

175
00:14:28,589 --> 00:14:38,547
Speaker 1: I kind of agree that those states should not get their votes because they totally broke the rules and it would ruin everything if they Voted now and it'd be a gigantic waste of money to do a reelection.

176
00:14:38,587 --> 00:14:43,070
Speaker 1: and luckily Michigan doesn't have any money as they're not gonna do it and I don't know what the reason was.

177
00:14:43,171 --> 00:14:44,781
Speaker 1: But Florida doesn't look like they're gonna do it.

178
00:14:44,801 --> 00:14:45,989
Speaker 0: That's probably for the best.

179
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:52,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, but my old home state I give them points for trying hard and saying hey, we're gonna totally break the rules.

180
00:14:53,071 --> 00:14:56,385
Speaker 1: But yeah, you lost that gamble and we'll see what happens in 2008 or two.

181
00:14:56,405 --> 00:14:58,898
Speaker 1: both I get is 2008 2012 the next time you get a shot at this.

182
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:08,674
Speaker 0: didn't you like do a story about how Michigan had to like shut down for a day because it was like Michigan was closed because They had no money.

183
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:10,942
Speaker 1: The Michigan State Government had that happen a couple times.

184
00:15:10,982 --> 00:15:12,990
Speaker 1: the Detroit city government has had that happened.

185
00:15:15,413 --> 00:15:18,230
Speaker 1: Oh god, I could do a whole show on what's been going on in Detroit recently.

186
00:15:18,691 --> 00:15:21,159
Speaker 0: And plus you've got your your ear to the wall.

187
00:15:21,239 --> 00:15:23,968
Speaker 0: as far as Detroit politics is cuz your dad.

188
00:15:23,988 --> 00:15:26,879
Speaker 1: yeah Actually, he's retiring in September.

189
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:29,810
Speaker 1: So I got a fly out to Michigan gonna do a fancy party.

190
00:15:30,092 --> 00:15:32,069
Speaker 1: I get to fly out to a fancy party.

191
00:15:33,876 --> 00:15:37,592
Speaker 1: Can I be your escort Scott?

192
00:15:37,753 --> 00:15:38,054
Speaker 0: Scott.

193
00:15:38,094 --> 00:15:39,198
Speaker 0: yesterday he was convinced.

194
00:15:39,219 --> 00:15:41,327
Speaker 0: Oh, oh now we're gossiping about Scott again.

195
00:15:41,367 --> 00:15:42,050
Speaker 0: This is terrible.

196
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:43,350
Speaker 0: You should never let me on the show.

197
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:50,790
Speaker 1: I think his argument was that there's a chance that there is an escort service out there that in fact provides escorts and nothing more.

198
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:51,795
Speaker 0: That's not what he said.

199
00:15:51,835 --> 00:15:54,850
Speaker 0: He said escort services only take you to parties.

200
00:15:55,112 --> 00:15:55,920
Speaker 0: You know what?

201
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,050
Speaker 0: I was saying to Alex today.

202
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:07,949
Speaker 0: I was like that would be great if they had like tickets to every you know red carpet event in the city and you'd hire an escort service and they would take you to the party of your choice.

203
00:16:08,109 --> 00:16:11,022
Speaker 0: even if You weren't invited you'd be like hello madam.

204
00:16:11,264 --> 00:16:12,349
Speaker 0: Can you take me to?

205
00:16:13,092 --> 00:16:16,229
Speaker 0: So and so's premiere party and they'd be like right away.

206
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:18,724
Speaker 0: No, no sex no sex.

207
00:16:22,011 --> 00:16:23,277
Speaker 1: I'm just looking for an excuse to do that.

208
00:16:23,297 --> 00:16:23,698
Speaker 1: I haven't done.

209
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:25,526
Speaker 0: I hate I hate quagmire.

210
00:16:25,546 --> 00:16:28,941
Speaker 0: I I'm sorry I just hate that but I have a being a trumpet player.

211
00:16:28,961 --> 00:16:31,030
Speaker 1: I have the rare gift of being able to do a gayety.

212
00:16:36,872 --> 00:16:41,130
Speaker 1: But yeah, I mean that I don't have much more to say other unless I go into crazy depth.

213
00:16:41,271 --> 00:16:50,010
Speaker 1: But the only chance Clinton has is Pennsylvania and I've actually donated a fair amount of money and our good friend the other Scott the stronger faster Scott.

214
00:16:50,070 --> 00:16:52,579
Speaker 0: He's fighting the good fight for the Obama side.

215
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,670
Speaker 1: He lives in Pennsylvania and he's actually campaigning and working hard.

216
00:16:55,771 --> 00:16:58,790
Speaker 1: So yeah, we've said this before but I'll say it again geek nights.

217
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:11,510
Speaker 1: the podcast officially endorses Barack Obama for president of the United States, but as Emily says Hillary is okay, but I like Obama better I. the thing is I have a lot of mixed feelings about Hillary.

218
00:17:11,711 --> 00:17:14,630
Speaker 0: You you guys don't you hate on her more than she deserves.

219
00:17:14,731 --> 00:17:22,587
Speaker 0: The thing is I liked Hillary a lot and and I I granted the ad Was was terrible and I thought that was a low blow and I was like Hillary.

220
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:23,369
Speaker 0: that is lame.

221
00:17:23,511 --> 00:17:24,778
Speaker 0: Do not do such lame things.

222
00:17:24,818 --> 00:17:32,117
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also the the whole thing I mean granted Barack did a little politicking too because oh sure Well, they're politicians.

223
00:17:32,217 --> 00:17:45,822
Speaker 1: doing politicking is kind of expected it Because Barack's actually in very little politicking like playing the political game and I think the biggest example of that was after his Former minister or whatever they call it in whatever church.

224
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:59,370
Speaker 1: He claims to be a member of yeah Why rich people blah black black blah and it was to turn his big media storm and he gave that speech and I think that Was a fantastic speech and that that was totally not the politicking speech.

225
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:04,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, because that was the speech that keeps that issue right in the limelight, you know Barack is the man.

226
00:18:05,449 --> 00:18:06,412
Speaker 1: He's also pretty sexy.

227
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:06,774
Speaker 1: I got her.

228
00:18:06,814 --> 00:18:09,966
Speaker 1: that smile is so just Okay.

229
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:10,849
Speaker 0: Now I've got two men.

230
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:13,720
Speaker 0: I've got to worry about Neil Gaiman and Barack Obama.

231
00:18:14,101 --> 00:18:19,396
Speaker 1: Sorry, if Neil Gaiman and Barack Obama are the presidential ticket and they happen to show up at a fancy dinner party.

232
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,339
Speaker 1: That's the end

233
00:18:23,221 --> 00:18:24,164
Speaker 0: So anyway, but

234
00:18:24,465 --> 00:18:37,997
Speaker 1: my motive mostly my mixed feelings on Hillary come from a lot of the politicking she's been doing and Also the fact that I still can't get over that she actually voted for the war Because I I can't fathom anyone ever thinking that was a good idea.

235
00:18:38,017 --> 00:18:38,940
Speaker 0: Yes ever.

236
00:18:39,861 --> 00:18:43,379
Speaker 1: And all she had to do was say, you know what I voted for the war and that was a mistake.

237
00:18:43,862 --> 00:18:45,409
Speaker 1: But no she stands by that vote.

238
00:18:45,429 --> 00:18:46,756
Speaker 0: that that bothers me.

239
00:18:46,836 --> 00:18:47,580
Speaker 0: that really does.

240
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:50,817
Speaker 0: You know, I I like it when people can admit their mistakes.

241
00:18:51,118 --> 00:19:01,371
Speaker 0: It's Because it's better to admit your mistakes then to have everybody know you made a mistake and be like what mistake You know, it's obvious you did something bad.

242
00:19:01,471 --> 00:19:03,940
Speaker 0: Just owed up to it and then we'll forgive you maybe.

243
00:19:04,782 --> 00:19:15,669
Speaker 0: So anyway, um, there was another thing we wanted to talk about involving people in the streets with flags All that and I'm very angry too.

244
00:19:15,749 --> 00:19:17,113
Speaker 0: It's a bit mad as hell.

245
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:18,196
Speaker 0: free Tibet.

246
00:19:18,316 --> 00:19:19,620
Speaker 1: I'm I said it it's on the.

247
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,292
Speaker 1: What's China gonna do about it?

248
00:19:23,312 --> 00:19:25,040
Speaker 0: Well, they probably don't let them listen to geek.

249
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:38,009
Speaker 1: So like they don't the Chinese government really doesn't understand when it is a good time to be oppressive and when it's the time To just let it slide Time to be oppressive.

250
00:19:38,029 --> 00:19:39,980
Speaker 0: there are good PR times.

251
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:42,140
Speaker 1: There are ways to handle being a press.

252
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:48,360
Speaker 1: Well if it be quiet about it York whispers free to bet or something like that under her breath at a Chinese thing.

253
00:19:49,245 --> 00:19:55,100
Speaker 1: If you just don't say anything about it It'll probably slip right under the radar and disappear.

254
00:19:55,681 --> 00:20:05,228
Speaker 1: But the fact that China came out so lame not just like strongly but the statements they made it wasn't like they were those strong Like communist blah blah blah blah blah.

255
00:20:05,488 --> 00:20:13,348
Speaker 1: It was like and Bjork hurt the feelings of the Chinese people And I almost laughed out loud when I read that.

256
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:16,917
Speaker 0: and it's like and you physically heard a lot of demonstrators.

257
00:20:17,017 --> 00:20:22,600
Speaker 1: So I mean to their credit the violence has been in both directions.

258
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:27,856
Speaker 0: Anytime you get one of those, you know, the tensions come to a head.

259
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:33,718
Speaker 0: in any situation You're gonna have people throwing stones on both sides of the the fight.

260
00:20:33,839 --> 00:20:37,380
Speaker 1: first We are totally back down and was like I just whispered it under my breath.

261
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,307
Speaker 1: I wasn't gonna make a big deal out of it.

262
00:20:39,669 --> 00:20:40,512
Speaker 1: Meanwhile China's like.

263
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:42,520
Speaker 1: we're totally gonna ban you from China Bjork.

264
00:20:42,861 --> 00:20:44,427
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, she's crazy.

265
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:54,640
Speaker 1: Anyway, she's not the only I mean China has done a lot of Anything involving China and foreign entertainers lately because there's been some utter hilarity.

266
00:20:54,781 --> 00:20:57,731
Speaker 1: I really feel bad for Chinese people who actually want to listen to music.

267
00:20:57,992 --> 00:21:03,530
Speaker 0: Yeah, I have issues with with China But anyway, so so about the the protests.

268
00:21:03,851 --> 00:21:06,760
Speaker 0: I was when I was with Taguchi son taking him around.

269
00:21:06,841 --> 00:21:13,340
Speaker 0: We we did the whole tour all around Manhattan and I was like but it's funny when you get me as a tour guide because you get all the big sights.

270
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:14,851
Speaker 0: Oh, this is the Woolworth building.

271
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:20,092
Speaker 0: This is the Chrysler building This is the Statue of Liberty, but you also get stuff like oh my god.

272
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:21,937
Speaker 0: This is my favorite manhole.

273
00:21:22,097 --> 00:21:23,040
Speaker 0: and look at that.

274
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:30,623
Speaker 0: That's this place where I ate it one time and these people got into a fight, you know, so you get these really Exactly.

275
00:21:30,683 --> 00:21:32,189
Speaker 0: I was just gonna bring that up.

276
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:34,700
Speaker 0: It's like I got my head stuck in there once when I was a kid.

277
00:21:34,981 --> 00:21:36,207
Speaker 1: It's better than the early tours.

278
00:21:36,287 --> 00:21:38,397
Speaker 1: I gave like hey Scott and Don.

279
00:21:38,457 --> 00:21:46,434

280
00:21:46,675 --> 00:21:49,886
Speaker 1: yeah, I wanted to show you That clock tower there.

281
00:21:49,906 --> 00:21:51,391
Speaker 0: Well, that's so good.

282
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:52,876
Speaker 0: Actually that clock tower.

283
00:21:52,956 --> 00:21:55,454
Speaker 0: It's it's a famous building Yeah, but I didn't know what it was.

284
00:21:55,474 --> 00:21:55,979
Speaker 1: I made stuff.

285
00:21:56,482 --> 00:21:58,812
Speaker 0: It's a bank and actually the reason why there are.

286
00:21:59,274 --> 00:22:00,740
Speaker 0: I found this out on the tour bus.

287
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:04,520
Speaker 0: I actually went on a tour bus for the first time ever in New York City.

288
00:22:04,821 --> 00:22:06,167
Speaker 0: It was it was actually kind of fun.

289
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:09,060
Speaker 0: If anybody else comes to visit I think we'll do that.

290
00:22:10,186 --> 00:22:11,956
Speaker 0: So we took this tour all around.

291
00:22:11,976 --> 00:22:23,860
Speaker 0: we went downtown we went through Brooklyn and and I found out that the only that that big bank building is Like the only skyscraper in that area because they were going to do a whole bunch of other ones.

292
00:22:24,401 --> 00:22:33,714
Speaker 0: but the day the bank stores opened and that building was complete the stock market crashed like the day of And it was just like oh so much for that plan.

293
00:22:33,734 --> 00:22:36,364
Speaker 1: No, thanks, man That's actually the.

294
00:22:36,665 --> 00:22:45,821
Speaker 1: the only bad thing about my job is that in these troubled economic times I have a lot to say but I'm now federally barred from saying it Yeah,

295
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:53,818
Speaker 0: just just promise me now that we're you know Facing recession as many people are saying you won't be out on any window ledges like they were in the 20s.

296
00:22:54,401 --> 00:22:55,491
Speaker 1: I'm not a stock trader.

297
00:22:55,632 --> 00:22:55,854
Speaker 1: It's the.

298
00:22:55,914 --> 00:22:56,500
Speaker 0: yeah, that's the.

299
00:22:57,445 --> 00:23:03,828
Speaker 1: If the stock market goes up I can make a whole bunch of money But if the stock market goes down Equal opportunities to make money.

300
00:23:03,848 --> 00:23:14,340
Speaker 1: as long as the stock market doesn't just sit there and not go anywhere As long as people are buying and selling stock I don't I don't have to worry about a stock is good or not and any trades I make or fake in the testing server.

301
00:23:14,801 --> 00:23:21,237
Speaker 0: So yeah speaking of Brooklyn though, you know today today is a very special day for me.

302
00:23:21,337 --> 00:23:22,280
Speaker 0: It's Japan day.

303
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:32,430
Speaker 0: Japan day because six years ago and then two years ago actually six years ago today I first set foot on Japanese soil and then two years ago.

304
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:43,800
Speaker 0: I had another plane flight over to Japan for college and I I think we should go to Brooklyn to the Botanical Gardens to check out the cherry blossoms in a few months.

305
00:23:44,121 --> 00:23:48,020
Speaker 0: You know do a little hanami get some booze and sit out under the trees.

306
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:50,297
Speaker 1: Yeah, I could be up for that.

307
00:24:00,582 --> 00:24:02,027
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

308
00:24:02,468 --> 00:24:06,424
Speaker 1: now Scott probably wanted to use this as a thing of the day, but you're gonna Be of course.

309
00:24:08,661 --> 00:24:11,230
Speaker 1: I think I have a right because I actually saw it before he did.

310
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:16,408
Speaker 1: I can say that because Oh dibs for like hours Last night Scott's like rim.

311
00:24:16,428 --> 00:24:17,813
Speaker 1: You got to see this hockey video.

312
00:24:17,993 --> 00:24:18,636
Speaker 1: Yeah after the show.

313
00:24:18,656 --> 00:24:19,900
Speaker 1: You got to watch this hockey video.

314
00:24:20,202 --> 00:24:22,173
Speaker 1: Oh my god, we got you video hockey fight.

315
00:24:22,193 --> 00:24:23,300
Speaker 1: It's not a hockey fight.

316
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:32,630
Speaker 1: so we go downstairs and I'm like Scott is this video where the guy shoots that short-handed goal from across the rink and he's like, ah But yeah, I saw it on College Humor.

317
00:24:32,991 --> 00:24:34,677
Speaker 1: That's probably where you found it, isn't it?

318
00:24:34,717 --> 00:24:45,160
Speaker 1: He's like, ah But I gotta tell you and I agree cuz he said the same thing This video did nothing but make my blood boil to see some hockey and I gotta go to a hockey game.

319
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:45,965
Speaker 1: I'm gonna go crazy.

320
00:24:46,065 --> 00:24:48,640
Speaker 0: I've been thinking about the Rangers so much lately.

321
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:57,860
Speaker 0: I don't know why but it's like I keep seeing people with jerseys and jackets and stuff And every time I see the Rangers thing, I'm like man, I kind of want to go watch some hockey.

322
00:24:58,101 --> 00:25:08,471
Speaker 1: Well that night when we were stuck in Manhattan for a while because we were thinking about it because we're walking you know, we got to go to Penn Station we go past all the Rangers people and We passed a whole bunch of scalpers.

323
00:25:08,531 --> 00:25:12,087
Speaker 1: I totally could have gotten a ticket if I really wanted Yeah, but then we wouldn't have gotten home.

324
00:25:12,147 --> 00:25:15,160
Speaker 0: and the fact is I already paid for those goddamn Amtrak tickets.

325
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,352
Speaker 1: So yeah, but see that's that's the level of pony up the.

326
00:25:18,372 --> 00:25:20,520
Speaker 1: can you take that extra level of screw it?

327
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,142
Speaker 1: Let's do it.

328
00:25:21,424 --> 00:25:24,380
Speaker 1: Then I would have been paying for like the hotel room and everything at that point.

329
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,667
Speaker 0: Let's Rangers tickets are expensive enough.

330
00:25:27,707 --> 00:25:30,436
Speaker 1: Let's just you know every year I debate getting season tickets.

331
00:25:30,496 --> 00:25:32,284
Speaker 1: now that I use in tickets I don't know.

332
00:25:32,345 --> 00:25:33,395
Speaker 0: We don't have time.

333
00:25:33,557 --> 00:25:44,440
Speaker 1: man I would go to a lot of hockey games if I had season tickets, maybe especially because the only reason I Discounted it before was that I worked in the Bronx not in Manhattan.

334
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:48,159
Speaker 1: It would have totally sucked to go to a hockey game in Manhattan from the Bronx.

335
00:25:48,784 --> 00:25:51,100
Speaker 1: But now I basically work at Grand Central.

336
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,360
Speaker 1: I can just go right there.

337
00:25:52,521 --> 00:25:59,832
Speaker 0: It kind of rocks that we all work in the city now and and Alex and I work in the exact same place No less, you know, we're like in the same office.

338
00:25:59,852 --> 00:26:01,540
Speaker 0: I'm like, aren't you sick of me yet?

339
00:26:01,722 --> 00:26:02,619
Speaker 0: Are you sick of me yet?

340
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,307
Speaker 0: You know cuz we're like we.

Speaker 0: we live in the same apartment building.

342
00:26:06,437 --> 00:26:09,109
Speaker 0: every in the morning He knocks on my door or I knock on his.

343
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,876
Speaker 0: we walked to the train station together.

344
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:11,720
Speaker 0: We ride the train.

345
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,540
Speaker 0: We don't talk a lot on the train, you know, we basically do our own thing.

346
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:21,495
Speaker 0: We walk from Grand Central to the office we sit and work on games all day Then we do the same thing only in reverse.

347
00:26:21,596 --> 00:26:28,778
Speaker 0: and yeah When you're as talky as I am I'm like if I were me I would be sick of me.

348
00:26:28,838 --> 00:26:34,342
Speaker 0: by now You're getting there All right.

349
00:26:34,362 --> 00:26:35,446
Speaker 1: So what do you got for me?

350
00:26:35,647 --> 00:26:36,169
Speaker 1: thing of the day?

351
00:26:36,310 --> 00:26:39,040
Speaker 1: don't let our guest host do things at the day.

352
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,920
Speaker 0: You're special but I came prepared.

353
00:26:41,161 --> 00:26:46,476
Speaker 0: Actually, I found two wonderful things today, but I've been deliciousing it up lately.

354
00:26:46,496 --> 00:26:47,720
Speaker 1: Delicious is so excellent.

355
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,804
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I did.

356
00:26:49,226 --> 00:26:52,339
Speaker 0: I signed up for it a long time ago cuz women's got were like use this use this.

357
00:26:52,439 --> 00:26:53,949
Speaker 0: it was Like years ago.

358
00:26:53,969 --> 00:27:01,740
Speaker 0: I remember Scott showing it to me the first time I saw it was on a train going to my internship and that was like More two and a half years ago or something.

359
00:27:02,001 --> 00:27:05,154
Speaker 0: So I've had a delicious account for a long time, but I never really used it.

360
00:27:05,255 --> 00:27:06,560
Speaker 0: and then now I started working.

361
00:27:06,560 --> 00:27:11,693
Speaker 0: I don't want to have Bookmarks on my work computer because then I can't access them at home.

362
00:27:11,713 --> 00:27:13,200
Speaker 0: So I delicious everything.

363
00:27:13,841 --> 00:27:18,069
Speaker 0: but anyway, I found this thing and I thought it's very appropriate for Japan Day.

364
00:27:18,089 --> 00:27:23,308
Speaker 0: and So when I was in Japan Especially in high school.

365
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:31,060
Speaker 0: There was this big thing Among the teenage girls called purikura, which is like a shortened version of print club.

366
00:27:31,461 --> 00:27:36,377
Speaker 0: There's these little stickers that you get in the photo booth in in game centers in Japan.

367
00:27:36,417 --> 00:27:37,380
Speaker 0: So you go to arcade.

368
00:27:37,784 --> 00:27:49,819
Speaker 0: It's like four bucks wealth 400 yen and you put in the coins and everybody, you know does a pose and then you draw all over it and it prints out this page of stickers and then you cut them apart and paste them in your album.

369
00:27:49,839 --> 00:28:02,029
Speaker 0: and And some of these girls had like these thick Binders full of purikura stickers and I'm like, let's see at a hundred yen a pop How much did they spend on these books?

370
00:28:02,069 --> 00:28:05,780
Speaker 0: These must be like these binders filled with treasure, you know.

371
00:28:06,622 --> 00:28:17,247
Speaker 0: And I thought wouldn't it be great if you can make purikura in America, but you know other than the occasional You know kind of lame Machine in an arcade.

372
00:28:17,327 --> 00:28:18,571
Speaker 0: It's it's not the same.

373
00:28:18,671 --> 00:28:20,035
Speaker 0: Trust me wasn't Wildwood.

374
00:28:20,075 --> 00:28:21,740
Speaker 1: Those machines are like five bucks.

375
00:28:21,921 --> 00:28:23,326
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's it's just it's.

376
00:28:23,527 --> 00:28:37,300
Speaker 0: it's nothing to compare with the Japanese arcade purikura but I have found a website where you can take any photo and You can doctorate with all the little cute purikura doodles and you can make it look just like purikura.

377
00:28:37,821 --> 00:28:43,060
Speaker 0: So if you want to do a purikura you and use it as like your icon picture or something go for it.

378
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:45,851
Speaker 0: It's called purikute and it is adorable.

379
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:56,080
Speaker 0: and for you guys out there because I know Just based on the the poll that more guys listen than girls There are a lot of hot pictures of Japanese girls on the site.

380
00:28:56,321 --> 00:29:07,182
Speaker 0: so like if you want to look at like cute ace and women being like In and doing doing mugging for the camera go there and and you'll probably get a different kind of enjoyment out of it than I Did.

381
00:29:07,223 --> 00:29:10,342
Speaker 0: but oh well So.

382
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:15,920
Speaker 1: but anyway now tonight we've got a bunch of shows like this lined up, but this is a good way to start it off.

383
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:26,654
Speaker 1: we've been really thinking about getting a lot of people who are in various professions that geeks might be interested in or Might not be interested in but also might not realize exactly what they're about just yet.

384
00:29:26,895 --> 00:29:28,640
Speaker 0: Actually Alex asked me today.

385
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:34,840
Speaker 0: He brought up the the idea of you you posed a while back about working in the game industry.

386
00:29:35,442 --> 00:29:40,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, because a lot of geeky jobs are not what you think they are like a video game tester.

387
00:29:40,781 --> 00:29:46,109
Speaker 0: Oh, we were talking about that today - Jamie brought it up because we were testing a game.

388
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:56,513
Speaker 0: we were testing the sledding game and you know basically it just like we play it over and over and over again and look for bugs and we're like man the server lags and blah Blah blah and we have to note down everything.

389
00:29:56,533 --> 00:30:01,817
Speaker 0: and we're like, you know You remember when you were a little kid and you wanted to be a video game tester.

390
00:30:01,917 --> 00:30:07,318
Speaker 0: so bad Because it would be so awesome to get paid to sit around all day and do video games.

391
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,402
Speaker 1: Yep Let's see.

392
00:30:08,683 --> 00:30:10,288
Speaker 1: hit the farthest left block.

393
00:30:10,589 --> 00:30:11,652
Speaker 1: Nothing bad happened.

394
00:30:11,853 --> 00:30:16,688
Speaker 1: hit the farthest left block while holding B. Nothing bad happened to became big.

396
00:30:21,001 --> 00:30:22,045
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's about it.

397
00:30:22,266 --> 00:30:25,580
Speaker 0: But with our games glitches always happen.

00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,551
Speaker 0: I'm like, um, I'm falling down a waterfall.

399

00:31:45,018 --> 00:31:48,540
Speaker 0: and I am basically the art department.

420
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:57,398
Speaker 0: I am the jack-of-all-trades for the visual part of the 3d and so I do everything from modeling to texturing to the actual animation of the characters.

421
00:31:57,419 --> 00:32:06,460
Speaker 0: and You know it started where I Drew a lot of sketches and said, you know, what what sort of characters do you want to go with?

422
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,739
Speaker 0: What what is the style we want to present here?

423
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:23,100
Speaker 0: And you know, I took a bunch of reference images from like everything from Wind Waker to triplets of Belleville, you know Just lots of different things to show to my boss and say so what are we going for here?

424
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:30,098
Speaker 0: And that's that's basically you know, the sketching out and deciding the look of the characters is what a character designer does.

425
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:45,140
Speaker 0: but You know, like I said, I I do basically everything Drawing and modeling and I can say oh, yes My name is Emily Compton and I model for a living and people go really with this look of disbelief on their face.

426
00:32:45,221 --> 00:32:47,220
Speaker 0: I'm like not the modeling you're thinking of hehe.

427
00:32:50,445 --> 00:33:20,585
Speaker 0: Anyway So about getting into animation which is the actual title of this show I Hear a lot of people who are into anime say they really want to be animators and I gotta tell you it's an awesome job but there are some things that I think you need to know about it before you actually become seriously interested in that as a career path and One of the things I want to bring up is Being an animator.

428
00:33:20,706 --> 00:33:25,460
Speaker 0: really kind of isn't something you just one day you decide you want to do.

429
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:28,211
Speaker 0: It's kind of like oh, I like anime.

430
00:33:28,512 --> 00:33:29,979
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll be an animator.

431
00:33:30,762 --> 00:33:48,180
Speaker 0: See, I think it's important to be drawing from a very young age and so like you have to be first interested in art and then become interested in animation I think and Then you'll kind of develop better as an animator.

432
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:55,490
Speaker 0: whereas if you were in something completely different like Programming and then one day you said I'm going to start drawing.

433
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,935
Speaker 0: It doesn't really work out.

434
00:33:57,015 --> 00:33:58,520
Speaker 0: So well, it's very difficult.

435
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:02,415
Speaker 1: Well, I think you said before that you even there were people you were going to school with.

436
00:34:02,455 --> 00:34:03,640
Speaker 1: who were you know?

437
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:04,905
Speaker 1: They're in animation programs.

438
00:34:04,926 --> 00:34:07,780
Speaker 1: They wanted to animate but they couldn't actually draw.

439
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:13,500
Speaker 0: It's like there are people and and there are jobs available in the animation industry.

440
00:34:13,721 --> 00:34:19,806
Speaker 0: If you don't even if you don't have the technical skills, and I mean, I'm not gonna lie to you I'm not even the greatest artist.

441
00:34:19,866 --> 00:34:27,880
Speaker 0: I'm just you know, run-of-the-mill middle-of-the-pack kind of deal and You've got some people in art school that will just blow you away.

442
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:38,811
Speaker 0: Like I have this friend who works for Pixar and he's he's a great guy because he draws like you just insanely well But he's he's just like the most laid-back down-to-earth.

443
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:40,014
Speaker 0: He's such a good buddy.

444
00:34:40,436 --> 00:34:44,152
Speaker 0: But anyway, um so when?

445
00:34:46,083 --> 00:35:06,939
Speaker 0: When you're looking into animation schools and stuff you gotta understand that there's going to be a wide range of people attending and you're probably Got to get over any sort of artistic competition you have Because otherwise you're just gonna be like pissed off and miserable the whole time because there are going to be people who are better than you.

446
00:35:07,922 --> 00:35:14,800
Speaker 0: But there there are people who are into art as a hobby and say they go to school for engineering.

447
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:15,663
Speaker 0: I remember rim.

448
00:35:15,703 --> 00:35:18,734
Speaker 0: you wrote an article for imagine FX, right?

449
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:20,540
Speaker 1: I did but it was about Otakon.

450
00:35:20,781 --> 00:35:26,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, the there's this illustration magazine called imagine FX and they've got some really really good artists.

451
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:27,960
Speaker 1: It's actually a pretty cool magazine.

452
00:35:28,381 --> 00:35:33,516
Speaker 0: It's expensive as all get out those those two magazines the CG world and imagine FX.

453
00:35:33,796 --> 00:35:39,836
Speaker 0: every time I pass the newsstand I was like drool, but they're $15 but drool, but $15.

454
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:45,632
Speaker 0: and I was that way with Terrible, you know, it's like as soon as I. finally, you know, okay.

455
00:35:45,673 --> 00:35:57,620
Speaker 0: I'm not buying new type, you know years ago I kind of you know Quit new type and then it was just like oh, but I found this new magazine and it's $15 Which is even more expensive than new type.

456
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:10,099
Speaker 0: But so anyway, imagine FX they had this article on this one creator and he went to school for engineering And then, you know, he finished his degree and he decided that he wanted to be a character designer.

457
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:15,980
Speaker 0: and He he had done art as a hobby and I think that's the important thing.

458
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:36,713
Speaker 0: You don't necessarily have to go to school for animation although it helps but you have to have this interest in art and you have to not just like anime and want to be Making anime to really like to draw and to draw all your life and to just look at the world and and think you know, what do I want to draw?

459
00:36:37,255 --> 00:36:57,520
Speaker 0: all the time and My teacher described it as like a satellite dish you're always constantly looking around and trying to pick stuff up and An animator actually there's a step more than that because because a visual artist they're looking at Objects and thinking about drawing and just taking the world in through their eyes.

460
00:36:58,082 --> 00:37:03,720
Speaker 0: But an animator also looks at how things move and so it's like I'll be sitting on the subway and being like man.

461
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:04,844
Speaker 0: That guy walks funny.

462
00:37:04,884 --> 00:37:06,168
Speaker 0: I'll have to remember that.

463
00:37:06,569 --> 00:37:07,854
Speaker 0: so it's like in my head.

464
00:37:07,894 --> 00:37:08,496
Speaker 0: I'm always thinking.

465
00:37:08,877 --> 00:37:09,840
Speaker 0: Oh that moves weird.

466
00:37:09,901 --> 00:37:11,077
Speaker 0: I'll have to remember that.

467
00:37:13,142 --> 00:37:19,199
Speaker 0: So anyway, you know you got any questions about Whether it's fun to animate.

468
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:30,618
Speaker 1: Well, actually I was curious too about in terms of what it's what's it like in school Like I want to like to be in school actually doing animation for grades and learning all this stuff freaking

469
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:53,427
Speaker 0: awesome Except for the times when you're up all night like Bags under your eyes and at one time actually I remember this very clearly staying up and pulling an all-nighter on an animation project because I remembered it thunderstormed and I saw lightning strike the Con Ed building and that was pretty cool and It was like 4 in the morning.

470
00:37:53,447 --> 00:38:02,306
Speaker 0: I was like, oh if I hadn't been staying up doing homework I never would have seen this awesome sight, you know, so but I Loved art school.

471
00:38:02,426 --> 00:38:14,247
Speaker 0: I went to NYU's Tisch School of the Arts so I I mean my impression of college life might be kind of changed by the fact that it was like Downtown Manhattan in Greenwich Village.

472
00:38:14,327 --> 00:38:15,149
Speaker 0: So it was.

473
00:38:15,269 --> 00:38:19,320
Speaker 0: it was actually quite a different experience from going to RIT and doing animation.

474
00:38:20,014 --> 00:38:21,882
Speaker 0: but Really?

475
00:38:21,902 --> 00:38:33,480
Speaker 0: I tell you this much if you decide to go into especially computer animation you will meet some of the most geeky laid-back people and Like a lot of my friends who are in animation.

476
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:36,549
Speaker 0: They're just really quirky really easy to talk to.

477
00:38:36,569 --> 00:38:38,153
Speaker 0: it seems like animation.

478
00:38:38,214 --> 00:38:49,020
Speaker 0: It attracts a certain kind of interesting personality and I remember just Animation floor had the best couch - that's that's a complete aside.

479
00:38:49,100 --> 00:39:00,620
Speaker 0: but I remember after those all-nighters I used to go to the eighth floor and just lied on the couch like You are my friend But I'd open those doors to the eighth floor and it was just like I'm home.

480
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,272
Speaker 0: You know, I I loved the animation program at NYU.

481
00:39:04,854 --> 00:39:06,760
Speaker 1: So it's great getting out of college.

482
00:39:06,981 --> 00:39:09,287
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, how do you get a job in animation?

483
00:39:09,327 --> 00:39:12,978
Speaker 1: I mean, oh are they just in the major cities?

484
00:39:12,998 --> 00:39:30,929
Speaker 0: or actually There are animation jobs outside the major cities But they're very limited and you'll probably find yourself doing a lot of motion graphics Which is like make stuff slide across the screen during commercials, you know Make exploding text during commercials.

485
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:36,080
Speaker 0: and so with the the main two two hubs There's also stuff in Canada.

486
00:39:36,361 --> 00:39:47,760
Speaker 0: So if you're in Toronto is something and I can only speak about the United States because I'm not really sure about you know say Europe or But New York LA that's your choice.

487
00:39:48,462 --> 00:39:50,286
Speaker 0: So I'm definitely.

488
00:39:50,306 --> 00:39:54,116
Speaker 0: I was born and raised in New York, so I really prefer the East Coast.

489
00:39:54,217 --> 00:40:03,703
Speaker 0: but I'm not Completely adverse to the idea of someday going out to LA to work for a bigger studio There.

490
00:40:03,783 --> 00:40:07,340
Speaker 0: there is a big studio in New York blue sky studios.

491
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:08,686
Speaker 0: They just did Horton.

492
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:11,500
Speaker 0: here's a who and actually a lot of my teachers worked for them.

493
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:15,280
Speaker 0: I remember Dean my my senior thesis professor.

494
00:40:15,855 --> 00:40:26,946
Speaker 0: He He did a lot of the animation for the sloth on Ice Age and he'd bring in clips all the time, but So New York's mostly independent.

495
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:31,680
Speaker 0: There's a lot of commercial work like a lot of music video work too in New York.

496
00:40:32,201 --> 00:40:40,327
Speaker 0: But if you want to do something like Disney or Pixar or any of the the really big big names Those are all out on on the West Coast.

497
00:40:40,649 --> 00:40:50,790
Speaker 0: So Actually my own story about how I got a job at my company so sauce doing the game animation that was completely random.

498
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,919
Speaker 0: So it was.

499
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:54,470
Speaker 1: you know, that's not so bad.

500
00:40:54,711 --> 00:40:56,017
Speaker 0: Tell you the story.

501
00:40:57,082 --> 00:41:04,247
Speaker 1: I kind of got my first job at IBM By accident and then from there everything was just the sea of accidents that got me where I am now.

502
00:41:04,569 --> 00:41:09,010
Speaker 0: Yeah So I'll tell you the story because because it's kind of a funny story.

503
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:15,767
Speaker 0: But I remember there was a note pinned up on the bulletin board on the on the eighth floor.

504
00:41:15,787 --> 00:41:21,470
Speaker 0: That was like a $1,000 character design contest and it had two stick figures on it.

505
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:29,198
Speaker 0: I was like who in their right mind with a flyer like this would give someone $1,000 for a character design contest.

506
00:41:29,218 --> 00:41:30,301
Speaker 0: This is this is crazy.

507
00:41:30,862 --> 00:41:42,130
Speaker 0: So I actually spent my birthday Designing like the evening of my birthday Designing characters for for the the contest deadline the next day.

508
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:47,630
Speaker 1: I think a lot of our and then I listeners will remember this because they were actually linked to in the forum by someone.

509
00:41:48,175 --> 00:41:56,829
Speaker 0: Oh, I was I was so sad though it was like it's raining and I ate Mexican food by myself and I spent my birthday drawing in my room and it was.

510
00:41:56,849 --> 00:42:00,720
Speaker 0: it Was a melancholy birthday and and then my friends called me.

511
00:42:00,741 --> 00:42:01,984
Speaker 0: They're like, let's go out tomorrow.

512
00:42:02,084 --> 00:42:16,929
Speaker 0: So that was all okay, but So anyway I submitted and they had a judging and I you might remember this if you've been on the forums a long time because I because I did kind of You know forum spam with the vote for me.

513
00:42:18,532 --> 00:42:19,696
Speaker 1: You did it cleverly in the.

514
00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:21,803
Speaker 1: I won't tell you which ones are mine.

515
00:42:21,823 --> 00:42:22,505
Speaker 1: Yeah.

516
00:42:23,027 --> 00:42:23,930
Speaker 0: No, I thought I did.

517
00:42:24,011 --> 00:42:25,382
Speaker 0: I thought I posted a picture.

518
00:42:25,402 --> 00:42:27,093
Speaker 0: I think you might have late I did.

519
00:42:27,173 --> 00:42:28,117
Speaker 0: I posted a picture.

Speaker 0: be like look at my characters check them out.

521
00:42:30,025 --> 00:42:31,050
Speaker 0: if you like them vote for me.

522
00:42:31,753 --> 00:42:38,050
Speaker 1: Maybe because I remember seeing them and not knowing which ones were yours ahead of time But being able to pick out easily which ones were yours.

523
00:42:38,090 --> 00:42:44,048
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz they looked kind of kind of Scott pilgrim II and my parents picked out these really anime.

Speaker 0: ask ones They're like, these are yours, right?

525
00:42:46,941 --> 00:42:48,689

Speaker 0: better I was like, no the ones you like are mine.

527
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,246
Speaker 0: the other ones those anime ones.

528
00:42:52,266 --> 00:42:52,929
Speaker 0: Those aren't mine.

529
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:54,617
Speaker 0: So that was.

530
00:42:54,677 --> 00:42:56,489
Speaker 0: that was fun, but I didn't win.

531
00:42:57,412 --> 00:42:58,876
Speaker 0: Some guy got his.

532
00:42:59,197 --> 00:43:09,162
Speaker 0: I found this out later because the guy who won was a friend of my coworker Brian who is awesome and He got his World of Warcraft guild to vote for his stuff.

533
00:43:09,222 --> 00:43:11,610
Speaker 0: So he won even though his stuff was kind of me.

534
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,316
Speaker 1: Yes, learn a lesson out there.

535
00:43:13,436 --> 00:43:16,950
Speaker 1: internet voting will never answer any question never never end.

536
00:43:16,990 --> 00:43:19,900
Speaker 0: well, but but anyway, I didn't win.

537
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:28,950
Speaker 0: I didn't get the thousand dollars, but Eventually, I got an offer to be a software tester at social sauce and so I said hey why not?

538
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:31,161
Speaker 0: They'll give me a dollar and some free movie tickets.

539
00:43:31,242 --> 00:43:32,770
Speaker 0: Why not test the software for him?

540
00:43:33,231 --> 00:43:46,060
Speaker 0: so I did and I talked to them and I did this a few times kind of got to know the boss a little bit and you know gave gave lots of bossy advice in focus groups about their photo application and stuff like that.

541
00:43:46,745 --> 00:43:55,862
Speaker 0: and then one day I See this post on the career board in in school.

Speaker 0: it was weird luck.

552
00:44:24,226 --> 00:44:25,430
Speaker 0: and then I thought back to her.

553
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,056
Speaker 0: I was like man.

554
00:44:26,116 --> 00:44:31,000
Speaker 0: if I hadn't spent that birthday Drawing those characters this chain of events wouldn't have happened.

555
00:44:31,161 --> 00:44:32,304
Speaker 0: I wonder where I'd be now.

556
00:44:32,324 --> 00:44:33,187
Speaker 0: and it was.

557
00:44:33,508 --> 00:44:34,230
Speaker 0: it was kind of weird.

558
00:44:34,331 --> 00:44:40,377
Speaker 0: So take that into account like never Discount any context you have like.

559
00:44:40,718 --> 00:44:42,724
Speaker 0: sometimes things just work out very.

560
00:44:42,784 --> 00:44:50,658
Speaker 1: that seems to go for like almost every profession I mean like IT and is the same way like everyone Who you know, everyone is connected.

561
00:44:50,878 --> 00:44:51,821
Speaker 0: See I'm turning into Lane.

562
00:44:51,841 --> 00:44:55,510
Speaker 1: be like everyone is connected or avatar when he goes to the swamp.

563
00:44:55,592 --> 00:45:05,209
Speaker 0: I'm still mad that that Rims watching avatar and finally I have someone to geek out about it with around you had you had a caden Adam.

564
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:08,440
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, your idol and I know.

565
00:45:08,521 --> 00:45:10,970
Speaker 0: but the thing is they weren't around all the time.

566
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:17,310
Speaker 0: So when I was watching it, I was like, oh, oh and this happened and Zuko is sad, but I couldn't say anything.

567
00:45:17,951 --> 00:45:19,536
Speaker 0: Zuko, he's so sad.

568
00:45:19,556 --> 00:45:21,242
Speaker 1: I don't know more and more.

569
00:45:21,302 --> 00:45:22,646
Speaker 1: I really like soccer though.

570
00:45:23,007 --> 00:45:23,890
Speaker 0: That's kind of funny.

571
00:45:23,970 --> 00:45:27,145
Speaker 0: I thought soccer would appeal to you because that that one quote.

572
00:45:27,186 --> 00:45:27,829
Speaker 0: what was the quote?

573
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:28,050
Speaker 0: whim?

574
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:33,888
Speaker 1: Oh the well, can your science and logics tell us why the rain falls?

575
00:45:33,908 --> 00:45:35,515
Speaker 1: Yes Yes, it can.

576
00:45:35,535 --> 00:45:38,770
Speaker 0: that was an episode where they were debunking fortune-telling.

577
00:45:40,791 --> 00:45:44,548
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly on woo woo and so it was so funny.

578
00:45:44,608 --> 00:45:48,870
Speaker 0: cuz I'm like This is gonna be an episode that appeals to room and he talked about it immediately.

579
00:45:48,950 --> 00:45:52,428
Speaker 1: I was like, yeah, that's your quote in there, you know, this is starting to give me an idea.

580
00:45:52,529 --> 00:45:56,070
Speaker 1: actually This is a total non sequitur, but not completely.

581
00:45:56,572 --> 00:46:00,026
Speaker 1: We've reviewed anime a lot on geek nights or movies or whatever, but it's always like me and Scott.

582
00:46:00,046 --> 00:46:00,890
Speaker 1: we do a normal review.

583
00:46:01,453 --> 00:46:09,890
Speaker 1: but I feel like we could do an interesting show if we got like Several front row crew people who had all seen the same show and just cut loose round table style.

584
00:46:11,411 --> 00:46:13,939
Speaker 0: I'd go for a round especially with something epic.

585
00:46:13,979 --> 00:46:17,150
Speaker 1: Like if we all talked about the old vampire 100 D movie or something.

586
00:46:17,431 --> 00:46:19,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually, I really want to watch.

587
00:46:19,717 --> 00:46:22,905
Speaker 0: get Sankey or the girl who jumped through time.

588
00:46:23,005 --> 00:46:26,777
Speaker 0: Toki Kake is really really Thinking about that today.

589
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:27,560
Speaker 0: Oh, man.

590
00:46:27,641 --> 00:46:29,510
Speaker 0: I love that movie, but get Sankey.

591
00:46:29,690 --> 00:46:33,010
Speaker 0: I'm kind of and but none of you guys have seen it, right?

592
00:46:33,350 --> 00:46:33,731
Speaker 1: I haven't.

593
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:34,695
Speaker 1: you haven't.

594
00:46:34,755 --> 00:46:37,003
Speaker 1: no one has said anything good about God hasn't?

595
00:46:37,204 --> 00:46:38,830
Speaker 0: Alex has it but it has dragons rim.

596
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,923
Speaker 0: Just watch it because it's Ghibli and dragon that comes from.

597
00:46:41,963 --> 00:46:43,410
Speaker 1: you didn't listen to last night's show yet.

598
00:46:43,691 --> 00:46:47,750
Speaker 0: Yes, I did and you were talking about rain of fire and how the movie blew.

599
00:46:48,192 --> 00:46:57,375
Speaker 1: Yeah, but also how the only good thing in Twilight of dungeon is and the only good thing in Early years is the cute dragon girl.

600
00:46:57,476 --> 00:46:58,298
Speaker 0: I like dungeon.

601
00:46:58,679 --> 00:47:03,052
Speaker 0: actually though you you were catching flak on the forums cuz you don't read to Comics.

602
00:47:03,072 --> 00:47:04,457
Speaker 1: I don't have time.

603
00:47:04,498 --> 00:47:04,979
Speaker 1: What do you want?

604
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,806
Speaker 0: Hey, you have a train ride.

605
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:07,770
Speaker 1: Yes a train ride.

606
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:08,902
Speaker 1: That's already full of ever.

607
00:47:08,963 --> 00:47:10,937
Speaker 1: avatar Cosino your Jimbo.

608
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:12,545
Speaker 1: and writing for my blog.

609
00:47:12,565 --> 00:47:13,570
Speaker 1: I've got like eight articles.

610
00:47:14,691 --> 00:47:15,634
Speaker 0: That's that's good.

611
00:47:15,674 --> 00:47:17,179
Speaker 0: That's that's a valiant pursuit.

612
00:47:17,259 --> 00:47:20,350
Speaker 1: studying the Napoleonic War so I could run my burning wheel game.

613
00:47:20,570 --> 00:47:22,819
Speaker 1: Oh, I'm still studying Greek history.

614
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,446
Speaker 0: No, you're very very good.

615
00:47:24,586 --> 00:47:25,510
Speaker 1: and Roman history.

616
00:47:26,192 --> 00:47:36,270
Speaker 0: But I just when you can started talking about writing on the blog it reminded me of something but Maybe I'll let you do it like in more depth as this thing of the day.

617
00:47:36,430 --> 00:47:43,890
Speaker 0: But I found the most awesome open source software for screenwriting and storyboard organization and making your ideas.

618
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:45,896
Speaker 0: So all you writers out there take note.

619
00:47:45,997 --> 00:47:50,170
Speaker 0: I have a present to show you and you probably already know about it.

620
00:47:50,270 --> 00:48:00,850
Speaker 0: Well, you just behind the curvy surprise, but but this thing I was thinking man I need a screenwriting program, but they cost money, you know, it sucks and I'm making do with word and macro.

621
00:48:02,252 --> 00:48:05,124
Speaker 0: And then I today I just stumbled across this.

622
00:48:05,144 --> 00:48:21,050
Speaker 0: I was like this is awesome and perfect and it's actually cute for an open-source gooey, you know, and Anyway So, I don't know if if I just rambled and you actually learned anything about what it's like to animate.

623
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:27,489
Speaker 0: but one thing I wanted to say in closing about debunking myths of animation is one.

624
00:48:28,513 --> 00:48:34,010
Speaker 0: It's not unless you're an independent filmmaker, it's not like I come up with an idea for an anime and I make it.

625
00:48:34,151 --> 00:48:36,650
Speaker 0: It's like your boss gives you storyboards.

626
00:48:36,851 --> 00:48:42,330
Speaker 0: They say draw a guy jumping and then getting angry and it should look like this.

627
00:48:42,731 --> 00:48:47,547
Speaker 0: And then you make it with many many drawings and the thing with animation.

628
00:48:47,647 --> 00:48:48,610
Speaker 0: as opposed to comics.

629
00:48:48,771 --> 00:48:50,237
Speaker 0: I do comics to relax.

630
00:48:50,317 --> 00:49:01,618
Speaker 0: I don't often animate in my spare time, but I I think it's very technical like Animation is is less artistic like the keyframes.

631
00:49:01,659 --> 00:49:21,568
Speaker 0: You have to have a good grasp of art, but it's a different kind of Skill and it's a different kind of knowledge than what takes to draw still image because you're basically copying the same drawing with minor changes over and over for like tens of hundreds and dozens of times.

632
00:49:21,709 --> 00:49:26,730
Speaker 0: and Yeah, so It's very time-consuming and can get really boring.

633
00:49:26,850 --> 00:49:27,913
Speaker 0: but I tend to.

634
00:49:27,933 --> 00:50:05,902
Speaker 0: I tend to get into the groove like I'll put some music on and I'll work and and then I fall into kind of a rhythm and you know, I turn out the drawings, but it's definitely not the same kind of Feeling you get when you draw a page of comic but there there is nothing like when you hit that playback or or shoot a pencil test and then you see This these drawings that were just drawings like come to life And that's that's the thing that gets me about animation is when you see a character that isn't real and yet You can give them life and it's also kind of like it's.

635
00:50:06,163 --> 00:50:11,783
Speaker 0: it's great for a control freak like myself This is why I wasn't meant for live-action cuz I'm like it's raining.

636
00:50:12,084 --> 00:50:13,870
Speaker 0: Why can't I control the weather?

637
00:50:14,971 --> 00:50:15,272
Speaker 0: You know.

638
00:50:15,332 --> 00:50:17,900
Speaker 0: and or why why isn't the light just right now?

639
00:50:18,201 --> 00:50:21,270
Speaker 0: in animation you can you control everything.

640
00:50:22,116 --> 00:50:23,989
Speaker 0: They are your puppets you make them dance.

641
00:50:24,743 --> 00:50:42,969
Speaker 0: but so just just to let you know one the creative control you don't get as much and Unless unless you are say a script writer or a storyboard artist then you get a little bit more say over over what it actually looks like as opposed to the execution.

642
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:46,593
Speaker 0: and Let's See.

643
00:50:46,613 --> 00:50:52,230
Speaker 0: so also You're not usually doing it by yourself.

644
00:50:52,571 --> 00:50:54,558
Speaker 0: You've got to work with a lot of other people.

645
00:50:54,638 --> 00:51:14,067
Speaker 0: and but that can be fun too because I remember working at the anime animation studio the animation collective which is doing speed racer and I crashed with these two while I was while I was working there and I remember that Every lunch hour we'd sit together and watch anime and it was great and and everybody was geeky.

646
00:51:14,208 --> 00:51:14,870
Speaker 0: Everybody was cool.

647
00:51:14,950 --> 00:51:15,572
Speaker 0: It was the most.

648
00:51:16,174 --> 00:51:19,283
Speaker 0: like I said animators cool geeky laid-back people.

649
00:51:19,343 --> 00:51:30,349
Speaker 0: for the most part you get the occasional like, you know Really tense Wow Angry Disney file, but then for the most part Yeah, animators are quirky and chill.

650
00:51:31,012 --> 00:51:37,388
Speaker 0: So I I think you'll meet a lot of cool people if that's the career you choose and draw draw a lot.

651
00:51:37,669 --> 00:51:39,474
Speaker 0: the end It's all this.

652
00:51:39,836 --> 00:51:40,358
Speaker 1: so I guess.

653
00:51:40,398 --> 00:51:52,209
Speaker 1: on that note if anyone has any actual specific questions I am sure Emily aka Gomi dog will be happy to answer them for you in the thread for this show And I'll make it into a flame war and then I'll draw Scott as a my waker.

654
00:51:54,333 --> 00:51:55,606
