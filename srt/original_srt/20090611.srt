1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,657
Speaker 0: It's Thursday June 11th.

2
00:00:11,897 --> 00:00:12,298
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:12,338 --> 00:00:14,384
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,585 --> 00:00:17,963
Speaker 0: We're gonna talk about losing stuff But it doesn't really go anywhere.

5
00:00:18,164 --> 00:00:26,614
Speaker 0: I'll be honest Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,993 --> 00:00:34,668
Speaker 0: So I realized that I start almost every show with the word so.

7
00:00:35,772 --> 00:00:41,969
Speaker 1: So yeah, I was listening to old episodes to start with the word knit instead or perhaps weave.

8
00:00:44,696 --> 00:00:48,408
Speaker 0: so anyway yesterday was.

9
00:00:50,513 --> 00:00:56,978
Speaker 0: It is rare, you know, usually when I have some sort of task before me some sort of journey I have to take some sort of thing I have to do.

10
00:00:57,018 --> 00:00:59,689
Speaker 0: that requires a lot of coordination has a lot of variables.

11
00:00:59,709 --> 00:01:04,629
Speaker 0: I plan it very meticulously and It always works out.

12
00:01:04,690 --> 00:01:09,530
Speaker 0: Okay, but every now and then you run into the situation where you plan with allowances.

13
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,500
Speaker 1: That's why you were home like not yesterday.

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,755
Speaker 0: This is why I didn't get home until like 1045 last night Uh-huh.

15
00:01:15,977 --> 00:01:16,990
Speaker 1: I thought I was mistaken.

16
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:18,879
Speaker 1: I thought we had to do a show yesterday, but I was wrong.

17
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,296
Speaker 0: No, but then today you're like We don't have to do a show today.

18
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,889
Speaker 0: The last year we did was on Tuesday and today's Thursday.

19
00:01:28,111 --> 00:01:33,130
Speaker 0: So I was in a situation where I allowed for error at each step of the way which we do.

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,520
Speaker 0: I mean anytime we're going to a con and the maximum error occurred at each step.

21
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,700
Speaker 0: the maximum possible error occurred at every Possible step of this journey.

22
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:42,645
Speaker 1: I just get to the point.

23
00:01:43,148 --> 00:01:49,227
Speaker 0: So Here's the task set before rim I had to meet with my lawyer whose office is in White Plains.

24
00:01:49,568 --> 00:02:00,150
Speaker 0: Well actually Technically it is in Tarrytown Directly equidistant between the White Plains train station on the Harlem line and the Tarrytown train station on the Hudson line.

25
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:01,798
Speaker 1: So you did you.

26
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:04,010
Speaker 1: obviously you tried to take a train and then a cab or what?

27
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:12,334
Speaker 0: So beyond that I needed to when I arrived at this lawyer have a cashier's check for some $20,000 Mm-hmm.

28
00:02:12,897 --> 00:02:13,520
Speaker 0: No big deal.

29
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,787
Speaker 0: I come into the city.

30
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:19,810
Speaker 0: I'm like, all right I can't go to the bank in Beacon because it opens it like eight and closes it like four.

31
00:02:20,992 --> 00:02:23,107
Speaker 0: And I think all right, there's got to be a branch in the city.

32
00:02:23,147 --> 00:02:23,590
Speaker 0: I get to work.

33
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:26,220
Speaker 1: I'm doing stuff around 830 branches in the city.

34
00:02:26,361 --> 00:02:28,630
Speaker 0: The nearest branch is in like Yonkers.

35
00:02:29,112 --> 00:02:31,341
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you have a fuck bank.

36
00:02:31,682 --> 00:02:31,923
Speaker 0: Actually.

37
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:32,867
Speaker 0: I have one of the biggest banks.

38
00:02:33,209 --> 00:02:33,450
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

39
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:36,510
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's not in the city not in the city, but it's everywhere out.

40
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,763
Speaker 1: Foreign banks in the city, but not yours.

41
00:02:39,387 --> 00:02:46,050
Speaker 0: So I Look and I see sure enough within a mile of the train station in White Plains and I've been there.

42
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:47,336
Speaker 0: He's to work over near that area.

43
00:02:47,356 --> 00:02:51,312
Speaker 0: In fact, that's the mall right there where I bought the iMac Mm-hmm.

44
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:55,142
Speaker 0: So my bank has a branch there that is open not until 4 but until 7.

45
00:02:55,142 --> 00:02:58,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, so my whole plan comes together.

46
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:02,970
Speaker 0: I'm gonna leave work at 4 catch the 420 Harlem line train to White Plains.

47
00:03:03,532 --> 00:03:07,870
Speaker 0: I'm gonna take a leisurely walk get some food go to this bank get a cashier's check.

48
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:11,170
Speaker 0: I assume that there's gonna be trouble and that's gonna take a half hour.

49
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:14,275
Speaker 1: I would have assumed an hour.

50
00:03:14,295 --> 00:03:16,082
Speaker 0: No as in from the moment.

51
00:03:16,203 --> 00:03:17,990
Speaker 0: I say I would like a cashier's check.

52
00:03:18,414 --> 00:03:19,890
Speaker 0: I expected a half hour of BS.

53
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:22,496
Speaker 0: Okay, no No, the walk everything was accounted for.

54
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:26,050
Speaker 0: then I was gonna walk back to the train station pick up one of those cabs.

55
00:03:26,373 --> 00:03:27,989
Speaker 0: I'm gonna take the cab to the lawyer's office.

56
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:31,450
Speaker 0: I'm either gonna tell the cab to wait cab couldn't find the lawyer's office.

57
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,030
Speaker 0: That was a bad idea or I lined up to have another cab meet me there after I'm done with the lawyer.

58
00:03:36,614 --> 00:03:38,870
Speaker 1: The cab is never gonna know how to get to the lawyer's office.

59
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:40,740
Speaker 1: You need to get the lawyer to come get you.

60
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:42,006
Speaker 0: I knew where the lawyers office was.

61
00:03:42,026 --> 00:03:42,710
Speaker 0: I could point them out.

62
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:44,116
Speaker 0: Like I I drove.

63
00:03:44,317 --> 00:03:47,250
Speaker 0: I drove past that like every day when I used to work over there.

64
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:49,259
Speaker 0: I knew exactly where all this stuff was.

65
00:03:49,279 --> 00:03:50,464
Speaker 0: I was totally set.

66
00:03:50,484 --> 00:03:52,392
Speaker 0: I Start to go.

67
00:03:52,412 --> 00:03:53,616
Speaker 0: I get on the train I go up.

68
00:03:54,358 --> 00:03:59,314
Speaker 0: I Can't find the bank.

69
00:03:59,395 --> 00:04:02,470
Speaker 0: I realize it's inside of the stop-and-shop and I go in there.

70
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,420
Speaker 0: There it is the bank in the stop-and-shop.

71
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:04,942
Speaker 1: This is bad.

72
00:04:05,384 --> 00:04:06,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's fine.

73
00:04:06,571 --> 00:04:11,062
Speaker 0: So I walk up and I'm like hi I'd like a cashier's check and they're like, oh, yeah for how much?

74
00:04:11,283 --> 00:04:16,897
Speaker 0: and I tell him we go back and forth and then they go when they come back and they're like We're out of cashier's checks.

75
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,570
Speaker 1: real so they could have done it, but they didn't have any.

76
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:20,752
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

77
00:04:20,772 --> 00:04:22,096
Speaker 0: you're out of cashier's checks?

78
00:04:22,118 --> 00:04:22,760
Speaker 0: You're a bank.

79
00:04:23,101 --> 00:04:23,724
Speaker 1: you print them.

80
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:24,627
Speaker 1: They have a printer.

81
00:04:24,788 --> 00:04:27,558
Speaker 0: I was like fine Can I have a certified check?

82
00:04:27,599 --> 00:04:28,502
Speaker 0: I'll just pay the difference.

83
00:04:28,522 --> 00:04:30,169
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, we're out of those two.

84
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:36,225
Speaker 0: So after a dumbfounded minute, I asked is there any way I can get this money?

85
00:04:36,246 --> 00:04:37,450
Speaker 0: and they're like, well you could withdraw it.

86
00:04:37,892 --> 00:04:39,321
Speaker 0: You just have to fill out a government form.

87
00:04:40,026 --> 00:04:43,830
Speaker 0: and for a second I considered this till I realized that that's incredibly stupid.

88
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:51,599
Speaker 0: I did not want to be taking a cab in White Plains and then walking to a train station with $20,000 in hundreds in a briefcase.

89
00:04:51,619 --> 00:04:52,622
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a bad idea.

90
00:04:52,923 --> 00:04:55,592
Speaker 0: They offered to give me a briefcase too Really?

91
00:04:55,613 --> 00:04:56,596
Speaker 0: They apologized.

92
00:04:56,636 --> 00:04:57,559
Speaker 0: They were so nice.

93
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,803
Speaker 0: But fuck that bank.

94
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,766
Speaker 1: They'd give you a brief.

95
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:01,030
Speaker 1: It was a stop-and-shop bank.

96
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:02,235
Speaker 1: It's not an actual branch.

97
00:05:02,275 --> 00:05:03,460
Speaker 1: It's a convenience brand.

98
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,464
Speaker 0: It was an actual branch.

99
00:05:04,664 --> 00:05:06,949
Speaker 0: really in a stop-and-shop It's a full branch.

100
00:05:07,171 --> 00:05:09,770
Speaker 1: Usually the branches in the stop-and-shop are just convenience branch.

101
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,710
Speaker 0: Actually no, from what I can tell the branches in the stop-and-shops are better than normal branches because they're open a lot later.

102
00:05:16,034 --> 00:05:20,326
Speaker 1: Well, they do have better hours But they're mostly just for people to line up and deposit their checks.

103
00:05:20,366 --> 00:05:27,450
Speaker 0: You realize that At least for good banks if any branch can do all the services of the bank except for very special services.

104
00:05:28,093 --> 00:05:30,603
Speaker 0: So if it says branch you can do what you need to do.

105
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,169
Speaker 0: I could have gone and applied for a mortgage there.

106
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:44,050
Speaker 0: So after talking to them for a little while and determining that they're useless and they at some point they're like well How about this if we give you a new account and transfer all your money into that?

107
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,327
Speaker 0: Then we can give you starter checks and then you can write a starter check.

108
00:05:47,367 --> 00:05:55,999
Speaker 0: and I was like Do you think the lawyer that is going to take this and give it to another lawyer to put in escrow is going to take A starter check number one for twenty thousand dollars?

109
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:59,209
Speaker 0: and she was like, yeah, that probably wouldn't work.

110
00:06:00,711 --> 00:06:01,313
Speaker 0: So I was like fine.

111
00:06:01,413 --> 00:06:01,895
Speaker 0: Never mind.

112
00:06:02,035 --> 00:06:02,336
Speaker 0: Fuck it.

113
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:03,621
Speaker 0: I'll sort this out.

114
00:06:03,661 --> 00:06:03,922
Speaker 0: Later.

115
00:06:03,942 --> 00:06:06,250
Speaker 0: I walked back to the terror town train station.

116
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:08,626
Speaker 0: All right, I walk up to a cab like art.

117
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,270
Speaker 0: I'll just go to the lawyer.

118
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:10,496
Speaker 0: Anyway deal with the rest of it.

119
00:06:10,536 --> 00:06:12,024
Speaker 0: I'll wire in the money or something later.

120
00:06:12,426 --> 00:06:14,930
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I walk as I walk up to the cabbie.

121
00:06:15,492 --> 00:06:20,189
Speaker 0: I remember the task that I did not complete at the bank because I was so vexed.

122
00:06:20,872 --> 00:06:22,379
Speaker 0: I did not withdraw money.

123
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:24,970
Speaker 0: No regular money because you see independently.

124
00:06:25,050 --> 00:06:26,796
Speaker 1: Well, this is this is your fault here.

125
00:06:26,877 --> 00:06:30,650
Speaker 0: independently of all this my ATM card, which is also a debit card expired.

126
00:06:31,053 --> 00:06:33,189
Speaker 0: Oh, right has never happened to me in my life.

127
00:06:33,531 --> 00:06:37,170
Speaker 0: So I didn't expect it and I asked my bank and they mailed me a new one.

128
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,982
Speaker 0: They're like, yeah, we had no money for this cab.

129
00:06:39,445 --> 00:06:40,634
Speaker 0: I had I had $33.

130
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,370
Speaker 1: that's enough for the cab.

131
00:06:42,651 --> 00:06:46,144
Speaker 0: All right, but I have no way to get more cash at all.

132
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,897
Speaker 1: after you get to the lawyer You can get some cash.

133
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,907
Speaker 0: Well, I could ask the lawyer to front me some money.

134
00:06:53,088 --> 00:06:55,237
Speaker 1: You're giving a 20,000 he can front.

135
00:06:55,278 --> 00:06:55,820
Speaker 1: he's a lawyer.

136

Speaker 1: He's got.

137
00:06:56,302 --> 00:06:57,950
Speaker 0: I was giving him money to put into escrow.

138
00:06:58,051 --> 00:06:59,056
Speaker 0: I wasn't giving him money.

139
00:06:59,217 --> 00:07:00,746
Speaker 1: You're gonna give him money also.

140

Speaker 1: All right, he's Knows you're gonna pay him back.

141
00:07:03,636 --> 00:07:05,744
Speaker 1: And if you don't he knows how to come after you.

142
00:07:05,824 --> 00:07:06,406

144

Speaker 0: and yeah, can I borrow 50 bucks to get on the train to take a cab?

145
00:07:14,450 --> 00:07:18,629
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm sure the lawyer you being such a good customer should get a car for you.

146
00:07:18,810 --> 00:07:25,809
Speaker 0: No, so I walk up to the cab, you know There's a million cabs lined up and I'm like if you can't take credit and the guy just starts laughing.

00:07:43,312 --> 00:07:47,530
Speaker 0: I don't actually talk to him until like 7 which is fine cuz I didn't get there to like 645.

154
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,535
Speaker 1: No, the banks closed now.

155
00:07:48,555 --> 00:07:50,202
Speaker 0: No, it was too late to get money.

156
00:07:50,242 --> 00:07:51,729
Speaker 0: Anyway, I know I'd given up on that.

157
00:07:52,775 --> 00:07:57,750
Speaker 0: I had already resigned Called the lawyer and then went home now because I had to sign the contracts.

158
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:58,915
Speaker 0: Anyway, I can wire him the money.

159
00:07:59,055 --> 00:08:00,883
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm contract was the important part.

160
00:08:01,385 --> 00:08:02,027
Speaker 0: we go over that.

161
00:08:02,228 --> 00:08:02,730
Speaker 0: He's great.

162
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:06,330
Speaker 0: I might talk to him about our the stuff we need for geek nights, too.

163
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,248
Speaker 0: Cuz he knows some people but he's far away.

164
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:12,579
Speaker 1: Not really Well, if we got to go see him we're driving.

165
00:08:12,981 --> 00:08:13,302
Speaker 0: Yeah.

166
00:08:13,322 --> 00:08:13,443
Speaker 0: Yeah.

167
00:08:13,804 --> 00:08:15,110
Speaker 0: It's actually a really easy drive.

168
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:21,830
Speaker 0: I only didn't drive because I would have had to pull such shenanigans like drive to Tarrytown in the morning park.

169
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:24,120
Speaker 0: They're going to the city is an idea.

170
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:25,910
Speaker 1: Just don't go to work that day.

171
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:30,207
Speaker 0: I had to go to work because I have important work schedule the shit for another day.

172
00:08:30,227 --> 00:08:34,342
Speaker 0: I had to do it right away For other reasons, so I take care of this.

173
00:08:34,443 --> 00:08:34,946
Speaker 0: I'm all set.

174
00:08:35,327 --> 00:08:35,708
Speaker 0: I leave.

175
00:08:35,729 --> 00:08:40,004
Speaker 0: I Call the number of the cab service that I looked up before I went there.

176
00:08:40,024 --> 00:08:40,466
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

177
00:08:40,587 --> 00:08:41,068
Speaker 0: No answer.

178
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:48,022
Speaker 0: So I walk to the Marriott next door and I'm like, alright Can I get a cab and pay for it with a credit card?

179
00:08:48,062 --> 00:08:49,307
Speaker 0: They were like, yeah, probably not.

180
00:08:49,368 --> 00:08:52,684
Speaker 0: I was like fine And I just get a cab and they're like sure.

181
00:08:52,745 --> 00:08:53,550
Speaker 0: they give me a bunch of numbers.

182
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,820
Speaker 0: I call a cab and he's like, yeah 15 bucks.

183
00:08:56,483 --> 00:08:57,870
Speaker 0: How long will it take for you to get here?

184
00:08:58,393 --> 00:08:59,443
Speaker 0: I can pick you up in 45 minutes.

185
00:09:01,392 --> 00:09:02,638
Speaker 0: I look at when the next train is.

186
00:09:02,658 --> 00:09:05,748
Speaker 0: I realized that if he picks me up in 45 minutes I will miss it.

187
00:09:06,011 --> 00:09:10,450
Speaker 0: It will be faster to walk the two and a half miles at the train station than a way for the stupid cab.

188
00:09:10,891 --> 00:09:12,296
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh two and a half miles is not bad.

189
00:09:12,557 --> 00:09:20,970
Speaker 0: So I start walking down a sidewalk-less freeway Completely in the dark in the middle of nowhere across white plains and Tarrytown.

190
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:24,119
Speaker 0: All right in a suit and wearing dress shoes.

191
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,383
Speaker 0: All right, that was.

192
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:26,967
Speaker 0: that took a while.

193
00:09:26,987 --> 00:09:27,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fun.

194
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:36,150
Speaker 0: It took me about 40 minutes to walk that partly because of the boots and the resulting blister Also because of the fact that I didn't actually get dinner because I was in a hurry.

195
00:09:36,351 --> 00:09:39,890
Speaker 1: This is a Harlem train that was taking you back to Grand Central.

196
00:09:39,911 --> 00:09:42,169
Speaker 0: No, no, no No, I took the Harlem train up.

197
00:09:42,672 --> 00:09:46,070
Speaker 0: Then I was gonna walk the rest of the way to Tarrytown and take that train home.

198
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:50,150
Speaker 0: Okay, so I don't walk to that train and then the rest of my trip was fine.

199
00:09:50,372 --> 00:09:51,866
Speaker 0: But you know, it takes an hour to get home from there.

200
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:53,336
Speaker 1: That was it.

201
00:09:53,518 --> 00:09:53,901
Speaker 0: That was it.

202
00:09:53,942 --> 00:09:54,870
Speaker 0: Nothing crazy happened.

203
00:09:55,432 --> 00:10:04,829
Speaker 0: I ran into some strange people walking to the train station, you know I'm a guy in a suit walking in the dark and People wonder what's up with that?

204
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,230
Speaker 0: So a lot of people pulled their car over and asked me stuff, but no one was willing to give me a ride.

205
00:10:09,813 --> 00:10:10,577
Speaker 1: What do they ask you?

206
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,950
Speaker 0: one guy was like, what are you doing out at night?

207
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:13,974
Speaker 0: Someone's gonna break your?

208
00:10:14,014 --> 00:10:14,737
Speaker 0: do something something.

209
00:10:14,757 --> 00:10:16,364
Speaker 0: and they drove off in Tarrytown.

210
00:10:16,404 --> 00:10:17,067
Speaker 1: who's gonna break your?

211
00:10:17,087 --> 00:10:17,449
Speaker 1: what it's?

212
00:10:17,469 --> 00:10:18,312
Speaker 0: Terry I was.

213
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:21,000
Speaker 0: I was actually on the border between Tarrytown and white plains.

214
00:10:21,742 --> 00:10:22,384
Speaker 0: It's fine.

215
00:10:22,404 --> 00:10:24,410
Speaker 1: I don't know who's gonna break anything.

216
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:28,204
Speaker 0: People basically pulled over and yelled weird stuff at me and kept driving.

217
00:10:28,224 --> 00:10:29,670
Speaker 0: All right, it was weird.

218
00:10:31,634 --> 00:10:32,117
Speaker 0: What can I say?

219
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:33,163
Speaker 0: why would someone do that?

220
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:34,108
Speaker 0: I don't know they're weird.

221
00:10:35,431 --> 00:10:36,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

222
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:37,018
Speaker 0: That's it.

223
00:10:37,139 --> 00:10:39,068
Speaker 0: It was just fail every step of the way.

224
00:10:40,132 --> 00:10:41,317
Speaker 1: That wasn't such fail.

225
00:10:41,337 --> 00:10:42,360
Speaker 1: You mean mid homes?

226
00:10:42,421 --> 00:10:43,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, I succeeded.

227
00:10:43,224 --> 00:10:53,440
Speaker 1: I also I would have driven Yeah, but that introduced extra complications, but it would have helped with the cab situation Yeah, but it would have avoided all that bullshit.

228
00:10:53,461 --> 00:10:56,695
Speaker 1: you probably could have driven to a further away Bank You could have done all sorts of stuff.

229
00:10:57,016 --> 00:11:01,966
Speaker 0: Well one white play you realize the traffic and white planes around that time You basically can't drive.

230
00:11:03,011 --> 00:11:05,140
Speaker 1: No, but you could have you know parked and and got.

231
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:12,375
Speaker 1: you could have gotten to a place to park that was close and then Walked and you know, nah anyway That's all I got.

232
00:11:12,395 --> 00:11:13,825
Speaker 1: Yeah, is it?

233
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:14,610
Speaker 1: we're not good to news?

234
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:15,555
Speaker 1: I don't think there's not.

235
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,248
Speaker 1: all the news is all sorts of tech gaming.

236
00:11:18,308 --> 00:11:23,385
Speaker 0: news For the proper days is all the rhetoric about how the new the drugs are.

237
00:11:23,406 --> 00:11:28,987
Speaker 0: said we're gonna end the war on drugs But then Obama made clear that no that doesn't mean legalize.

238
00:11:29,288 --> 00:11:34,961
Speaker 1: So oh So we'll still keep it illegal, but we'll just stop enforcing make it.

239
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:38,490
Speaker 0: No, basically we'll make it slightly less illegal.

240
00:11:39,152 --> 00:11:41,602
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not stopping the war on drugs

241
00:11:41,622 --> 00:11:53,664
Speaker 0: to a degree because if you stop the quote-unquote war I guess that basically just means stop all the rhetoric stop funding all the programs that don't work like dare and I don't know lower the minimum sentences or get rid of them.

242
00:11:53,684 --> 00:11:56,950
Speaker 1: I Mean, you know every little bit is good.

243
00:11:57,070 --> 00:12:02,950
Speaker 0: But I guess I'm just always disappointed that every time I see news that's like Obama administration does something crazy.

244
00:12:03,211 --> 00:12:08,507
Speaker 0: Awesome, if I read the articles like they basically completely backpedal to almost where they started by the end of it.

245
00:12:08,848 --> 00:12:10,760
Speaker 0: Yeah But who?

246
00:12:10,821 --> 00:12:11,790
Speaker 0: I don't know who to blame more?

247
00:12:12,111 --> 00:12:16,366
Speaker 0: I can't really blame the administration so much as the media for lying to me through headlines yet again.

248
00:12:16,386 --> 00:12:23,534
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Well, you know, they got to boil everything down, you know to its simplest, you know, what levels of discourse episode I think we talked about that.

249
00:12:23,574 --> 00:12:23,755
Speaker 1: Yeah.

250
00:12:24,136 --> 00:12:24,418
Speaker 0: Okay.

251
00:12:24,638 --> 00:12:25,622
Speaker 0: Let's just get right on with it.

252
00:12:25,904 --> 00:12:27,430
Speaker 1: Okay, so you want to just do things today?

253
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:28,031
Speaker 0: I think so.

254
00:12:34,526 --> 00:12:38,270
Speaker 0: So then moving right along here Tomorrow is an auspicious day.

255
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:42,558
Speaker 0: I'm sure you all know that by the time you listen to this The Red Wings will have won the Stanley Cup again.

256
00:12:42,578 --> 00:12:42,859
Speaker 0: who?

257
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,562
Speaker 1: what if they didn't?

258
00:12:44,064 --> 00:12:47,884
Speaker 1: I am so sure that Game sevens are basically a coin toss.

259
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:50,593
Speaker 0: I am Absolutely.

260
00:12:50,653 --> 00:12:50,874
Speaker 0: Sure.

261
00:12:50,995 --> 00:12:52,944
Speaker 0: I guarantee a hundred percent.

262
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:54,010
Speaker 0: The Red Wings are going to win.

263
00:12:55,551 --> 00:12:57,275
Speaker 1: It's totally 50/50.

264
00:12:57,275 --> 00:12:58,398
Speaker 0: No, they're not even close.

265
00:12:58,619 --> 00:13:01,045
Speaker 1: So so what if they don't?

266
00:13:01,266 --> 00:13:01,847
Speaker 1: what do you do?

267
00:13:01,868 --> 00:13:02,790
Speaker 0: There's no possibility.

268
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:08,050
Speaker 1: Well, you have a guarantee which means a guarantee means that if it doesn't happen then you have to somehow.

269
00:13:08,732 --> 00:13:13,690
Speaker 0: Well, you know one I reference the movie Tommy Boy and two it doesn't matter because they're gonna win.

270
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:16,310
Speaker 0: Ah, the Red Wings are absolutely going to win the Stanley.

271
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:19,965
Speaker 0: In fact, you can effectively say that they already have won it for 2009.

272
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:34,183
Speaker 1: Yes My thing today is the Red Wings winning the Stanley Cup in 2008 against the same team The same team which is now You know, which was a young team and is now older and more experienced.

273
00:13:34,203 --> 00:13:36,350
Speaker 1: Then the Red Wings is now.

274
00:13:37,092 --> 00:13:39,089
Speaker 1: They were old last year and experienced.

275
00:13:39,129 --> 00:13:40,494
Speaker 1: now They are just old.

276
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:44,506
Speaker 1: old but because that's the penguins are only getting it better.

277
00:13:44,526 --> 00:13:45,790
Speaker 1: The Red Wings are only getting it worse.

278
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:46,703
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

279
00:13:47,531 --> 00:13:49,156
Speaker 1: It's a young team versus an old team.

280
00:13:49,196 --> 00:13:49,858
Speaker 1: That's how it is.

281
00:13:49,878 --> 00:13:49,938
Speaker 1: Now.

282
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,689
Speaker 0: Welcome to the world, but the Red Wings are just so good.

283
00:13:55,195 --> 00:13:56,089
Speaker 0: They just keep getting better.

284
00:13:56,971 --> 00:13:58,661
Speaker 1: No, in fact, they're worse than they were last year.

285
00:13:58,681 --> 00:13:59,848
Speaker 1: That's why they're in game seven.

286
00:13:59,948 --> 00:14:01,861
Speaker 1: last year They won well before game seven.

287
00:14:02,163 --> 00:14:03,069
Speaker 0: No, that was just flukes.

288
00:14:04,952 --> 00:14:10,870
Speaker 0: They see I'm gonna say I'm not gonna back this up at all that they pushed it to game seven.

289
00:14:10,971 --> 00:14:12,782
Speaker 1: How many hockey games did you even watch this year?

290
00:14:12,802 --> 00:14:14,009
Speaker 0: To make it more fun?

291
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,576
Speaker 0: Anyway, they're definitely gonna win.

292
00:14:16,656 --> 00:14:20,470
Speaker 0: So my alternate thing of the day is this old NHL.

293
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:27,450
Speaker 0: I don't know how old it is But it's an animation of the raising of the cup comprised of cup raisings from past Stanley Cup championships.

294
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:34,656
Speaker 1: Yeah I just want to point out though that ESPN people's think the Penguins are gonna win just so ESPN's wrong because they are.

295
00:14:34,757 --> 00:14:36,603
Speaker 1: they're the what they're because here here is the.

296
00:14:36,964 --> 00:14:38,930
Speaker 1: here's the argument for why the penguins are gonna win.

297
00:14:39,111 --> 00:14:40,135
Speaker 0: I can see one argument.

298
00:14:40,195 --> 00:14:41,118
Speaker 0: they could make the argument.

299
00:14:41,138 --> 00:14:43,306
Speaker 0: That was the same reason why the Red Wings won in 96.

300
00:14:43,306 --> 00:14:46,014
Speaker 1: No Here's the correct argument.

301
00:14:46,075 --> 00:14:46,455
Speaker 1: Right?

302
00:14:46,616 --> 00:14:50,927
Speaker 1: The Penguins this year beat the Capitals away in game seven.

303
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:52,170
Speaker 1: They're gonna do the same thing.

304
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,330
Speaker 0: Yeah But I got it down.

305
00:14:54,471 --> 00:15:01,381
Speaker 0: I've read a lot of articles in the past talking about how the Joe Luce arena is Statistically the most inhospitable away team arena there is.

306
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:02,666
Speaker 1: I don't think it matters.

307
00:15:03,228 --> 00:15:03,790
Speaker 0: I think it does.

308
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:04,314
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

309
00:15:04,374 --> 00:15:06,450
Speaker 0: Anyway, they're gonna win so it doesn't matter.

310
00:15:06,590 --> 00:15:13,789
Speaker 1: How could it possibly be more inhospitable than the freakin capitals where every single human being is wearing red and screaming?

311
00:15:14,570 --> 00:15:17,290
Speaker 1: The entire game I point doesn't get more inhospitable than that.

312
00:15:17,331 --> 00:15:23,110
Speaker 0: I point out that the Red Wings Actually used to cheat and their bench for the opposing team was shorter and the door was hard.

313
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,397
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're no longer cheating.

314
00:15:24,417 --> 00:15:26,550
Speaker 0: So I'm sure they're cheating in some other way.

315
00:15:27,671 --> 00:15:31,461
Speaker 0: Anyway, plus Joe Lewis's fist is right there.

316
00:15:31,561 --> 00:15:33,306
Speaker 1: It's outside where you can't punch you.

317
00:15:33,346 --> 00:15:34,168
Speaker 0: It's right next door.

318
00:15:34,189 --> 00:15:34,670
Speaker 0: Just waiting.

319
00:15:34,991 --> 00:15:38,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you go outside, it'll punch you but it can't punch you while you're ice skating.

320
00:15:42,174 --> 00:15:49,082
Speaker 1: So I was reading on Boing Boing that apparently it's illegal to possess Anything that belongs to an eagle.

321
00:15:49,263 --> 00:15:50,629
Speaker 0: so what I knock off his car.

322
00:15:51,212 --> 00:15:51,954
Speaker 0: What not like?

323
00:15:51,974 --> 00:15:55,446
Speaker 1: if you have an eagle feather you can get in serious trouble like $10,000 fines and worse.

324
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,656
Speaker 1: Right, and that's that's pretty rough.

325
00:15:59,997 --> 00:16:07,770
Speaker 1: Obviously, it's the stop eagle poaching, but I think it has a side effect on oh shit An eagle feather landed in my yard and now I'm in trouble, right?

326
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:26,170
Speaker 1: Also, it was pretty interesting because people were talking about how like at the veterinary places with it to take care of Eagles They have to take all of these sort of Eagle refuse and send it to this place that the government runs and then if Native Americans want said Eagle refuse like feathers for their kinds of stuff that they need it for.

327
00:16:27,032 --> 00:16:33,270
Speaker 1: Then they have to make like these bureaucratic requests that made that you know are very stringent and can be denied and such.

328
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:44,450
Speaker 1: So yeah, so anyway in the comments of this post on Boing Boing talking all about owning Eagle bits Someone posted a link to a video and they said this guy's in serious trouble.

329
00:16:45,354 --> 00:16:49,190
Speaker 1: And this guy is some dude and it looks like he has an airport or something in the backyard.

330
00:16:49,331 --> 00:16:57,100
Speaker 1: I can't tell but he had 30 bald eagles in the backyard and His kids were playing with the bald eagles in the backyard.

331
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:01,637
Speaker 1: and the reason that the Eagles were there was because they attracted them With the red seven.

332
00:17:02,321 --> 00:17:04,089
Speaker 0: Ah, the red salmon would attract me as well.

333
00:17:04,210 --> 00:17:12,144
Speaker 1: Yes, so they had the red salmon and like 30 bald eagles in the backyard and they weren't hunting them They were just having them in the backyard going on my hands.

334
00:17:12,164 --> 00:17:15,564
Speaker 1: Look at that 30 bald eagles and put it on youtubes and such.

335
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,868
Speaker 0: but They're actually not super endangered anymore.

336
00:17:19,251 --> 00:17:26,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, so as I said, it used to be wicked endangered, but because they were protected so much they're only kind of sort of endangered.

337
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:29,450
Speaker 0: Well, actually there there is a sliding scale and they are a least concern.

338
00:17:29,611 --> 00:17:29,992
Speaker 0: It is the.

339
00:17:30,435 --> 00:17:34,292
Speaker 0: it is the least endangered you can be and still be on the endangered list Exactly.

340
00:17:34,332 --> 00:17:40,110
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, they're not like say seagulls or pigeons to where it's like who the fuck cares.

341
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:41,074
Speaker 1: There's a bajillion of them.

342
00:17:41,095 --> 00:17:41,999
Speaker 1: There's probably too many.

343
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:46,581
Speaker 1: but they're also not like say Pandas where it's like fuck this five.

344
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:51,344
Speaker 1: I Think there's more than five pandas, but you know, there's at least seven.

345
00:17:51,364 --> 00:17:53,598
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot more than that I think but there's still not.

346
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,090
Speaker 1: not a whole lot anyway.

347
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:59,608
Speaker 1: so 30 bald eagles in the backyard video pretty cool.

348
00:17:59,689 --> 00:18:02,055
Speaker 1: So Today's episode I want to.

349
00:18:02,557 --> 00:18:04,284
Speaker 0: well tonight's tonight's episode.

350
00:18:04,304 --> 00:18:04,866
Speaker 1: You're correct.

351
00:18:04,886 --> 00:18:05,087
Speaker 1: Yes.

352
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:13,360
Speaker 1: We're going to talk about Losing things because everyone in their life loses things, you know physical things, you know, they they disappear.

353
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:22,410
Speaker 1: and You know, I lost something recently and it's sort of obvious and inevitable and foreshadowed years in advance.

354
00:18:23,273 --> 00:18:23,654
Speaker 1: Do you know what?

355
00:18:23,694 --> 00:18:25,801
Speaker 0: I lost you lost those expensive sunglasses?

356
00:18:26,142 --> 00:18:26,683
Speaker 0: Absolutely.

357
00:18:26,724 --> 00:18:27,546
Speaker 0: I can't believe it.

358
00:18:27,566 --> 00:18:36,650
Speaker 1: So Uh, so basically I realized not only did I lose them but I have determined scientifically why I lost them.

359
00:18:37,091 --> 00:18:43,010
Speaker 0: All right, I'm curious because I'd I you know, everyone's different about this, but I'm actually I rarely lose things.

360
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:45,839
Speaker 1: See I used to but I'll tell you my losing history.

361
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,321
Speaker 1: Why not?

362
00:18:46,401 --> 00:18:46,622
Speaker 1: Right?

363
00:18:46,642 --> 00:18:47,023
Speaker 0: All right.

364
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:51,615
Speaker 1: So back in the day back Back in the day, right?

365
00:18:52,097 --> 00:19:00,543
Speaker 1: I would lose shit and it was all I would never lose like completely normal shit Like oh I lost a pencil I would always lose the expensive thing, right?

366
00:19:01,045 --> 00:19:06,610
Speaker 1: And the reason was this number one If I had an expensive thing like say a fancy pen, right?

367
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:09,516
Speaker 1: I'd want to use it a lot.

368
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:27,674
Speaker 1: So I'd be bringing it all around thus increasing the chances of losing it Multifold right and also because it was such a special thing I would always be you know Treating it precariously and differently from other things putting it in special places and such and such Preteriously?

369
00:19:27,774 --> 00:19:28,095
Speaker 1: Yes.

370
00:19:28,457 --> 00:19:30,265
Speaker 0: That's that's quite an adjective there.

371
00:19:30,486 --> 00:19:34,590
Speaker 1: Yes, and thus Also increasing his chances of being lost, right?

372
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:41,330
Speaker 1: If I would have just kept it in the pencil box with all the other pencils, it would have been just fine You know, but no I had to put it in a special place.

373
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:44,664
Speaker 1: So we didn't get all messed up by all those regular pencils in the pencil box.

374
00:19:44,704 --> 00:19:46,230
Speaker 1: Of course it got lost, right?

375
00:19:46,551 --> 00:19:56,359
Speaker 1: I would also often lose watches wristwatches and I'm pretty sure if I still wore wristwatches I would still lose them because Number one right the wristwatch.

376
00:19:56,399 --> 00:19:57,102
Speaker 0: How could you lose it?

377
00:19:57,182 --> 00:19:58,086
Speaker 0: It's on your wrist.

378
00:19:58,226 --> 00:20:01,370
Speaker 1: Okay, so here's the thing Right the wristwatch while you're wearing it.

379
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:06,101
Speaker 1: It's not a problem and if you get a waterproof one it's even better because you can bring it in the pool and such.

380
00:20:06,121 --> 00:20:06,422
Speaker 1: so it's even.

381
00:20:06,482 --> 00:20:10,050
Speaker 1: you know, you're hardly ever gonna lose it but They're sort of uncomfortable.

382
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:11,999
Speaker 1: So I never liked.

383
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:17,565
Speaker 1: actually I liked having them Wet, you know in the days before cell phones so I could tell the time but I never.

384
00:20:17,585 --> 00:20:18,890
Speaker 1: they were never comfortable on my arm.

385
00:20:18,970 --> 00:20:23,360
Speaker 1: I always used to get a Timex You know the kind that had the two big buttons on the front.

386
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:26,110
Speaker 0: You gotta get the nice one with some sort of leather strap.

387
00:20:27,211 --> 00:20:28,316
Speaker 0: Anyway, I hate more comfortable.

388
00:20:28,336 --> 00:20:29,683
Speaker 1: Even though it's still uncomfortable to me.

389
00:20:29,823 --> 00:20:30,165
Speaker 1: I can't.

390
00:20:30,185 --> 00:20:32,770
Speaker 1: I hate a wristwatch anyway So it was always uncomfortable.

391
00:20:32,931 --> 00:20:36,565
Speaker 1: So for example, I would take it off when I went to bed or take it off for a shower.

392
00:20:36,585 --> 00:20:41,483
Speaker 1: or you know I would take it off and put it on adjusted adjusted, you know such and such.

393
00:20:41,784 --> 00:20:49,563
Speaker 1: maybe if I was like timing something Rather than like poke at the buttons while it was on my wrist I would take it off and hold it in one hand to get more accurate.

394
00:20:49,643 --> 00:21:00,830
Speaker 1: Stop watching activity, right and Because of this constant maneuvering of the watch it was inevitable that I would lose track of it Especially since you know, I might not wear it every day.

395
00:21:00,970 --> 00:21:05,189
Speaker 1: So then it's like you don't remember if you're wearing it or if you're not wearing it or whatnot, right?

396
00:21:06,132 --> 00:21:07,790
Speaker 1: So the sunglasses, right?

397
00:21:08,051 --> 00:21:13,710
Speaker 1: So my whole life I've always bought cheap sunglasses because a I would lose them and B I would break them.

398
00:21:13,790 --> 00:21:16,609
Speaker 1: So I figured hey, I'm better off buying cheap ones.

399
00:21:17,152 --> 00:21:19,441
Speaker 1: That way I can break them and lose them and just buy another one.

400
00:21:19,482 --> 00:21:25,061
Speaker 0: see now that's the opposite of my philosophy Which is buy the best possible and keep them forever.

401
00:21:25,302 --> 00:21:27,950
Speaker 1: and I changed my strategy to that very strategy.

402
00:21:28,553 --> 00:21:29,939
Speaker 1: Yet all the whole time.

403
00:21:30,019 --> 00:21:33,093
Speaker 1: I was still thinking I'm going to fucking lose these things I'm gonna break them.

404
00:21:33,134 --> 00:21:33,937
Speaker 1: who knows what the fuck?

405
00:21:33,997 --> 00:21:40,210
Speaker 1: in fact, actually they were made of plastic as opposed to metal Which is sort of like hey, I paid $200 for these like a plastic instead of metal.

406
00:21:40,631 --> 00:21:43,683
Speaker 1: But actually that's better because it doesn't change in shape like metal ones.

407
00:21:43,744 --> 00:21:49,208
Speaker 0: bend right and then well Well, I mean if you get nice titanium ones, they don't they just bend right back.

408
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:49,750
Speaker 0: That's true.

409
00:21:49,830 --> 00:21:52,804
Speaker 1: But you know the plastic ones they just stay in the same nice shape.

410
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:54,110
Speaker 1: and the polarized lenses?

411
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,970
Speaker 1: I was just so much better than the regular lenses and they were more comfortable.

412
00:21:58,111 --> 00:22:02,049
Speaker 1: The only complaint I really had with them is that my hair got caught in them, which is annoying and hurt.

413
00:22:03,292 --> 00:22:06,430
Speaker 1: But anyway, so I was very careful not to lose them.

414
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:14,469
Speaker 1: But losing them was inevitable and the reason is thus number one Sunglasses don't stay on your face all the time.

415
00:22:15,072 --> 00:22:19,206
Speaker 1: You got to take them off when it's not sunny or if you're inside or who knows what right?

416
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:19,728
Speaker 1: All right.

417
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:22,476
Speaker 1: number two There is not when you take them off.

418
00:22:22,757 --> 00:22:26,148
Speaker 1: There isn't really a secure place to put them right.

419
00:22:26,168 --> 00:22:26,850
Speaker 1: that is consistent.

420
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:30,222
Speaker 1: Like for example, Mike I used to lose wallets occasionally not too often.

421
00:22:30,242 --> 00:22:39,730
Speaker 1: I've lost I think two wallets, but I wouldn't lose them often because a I would always keep them in the same exact secure place front right pocket.

422
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:41,357
Speaker 1: It was never in a different place.

423
00:22:41,377 --> 00:22:43,124
Speaker 1: front pocket, of course.

424
00:22:43,164 --> 00:22:46,201
Speaker 1: Whoa Rear pocket fucks up the way you sit.

425
00:22:46,261 --> 00:22:47,650
Speaker 1: I don't know why people put it in the rear pocket.

426
00:22:47,911 --> 00:22:48,334
Speaker 0: I don't.

427
00:22:48,595 --> 00:22:56,510
Speaker 0: I've never understood that because all the pants I have Where the rear pocket is is slightly away from where the tailbone is or where the butt bone is.

428
00:22:57,032 --> 00:22:59,324
Speaker 0: So it doesn't in any way affect how I say.

429
00:22:59,385 --> 00:23:00,310
Speaker 1: it's like sitting on a lump.

430
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:00,531
Speaker 1: It's.

431
00:23:00,611 --> 00:23:02,883
Speaker 0: it's a pain in the ass pants that it does get in the way.

432
00:23:03,204 --> 00:23:03,888
Speaker 0: I can't deal with.

433
00:23:03,908 --> 00:23:06,683
Speaker 1: no Anyway, I've never used the rear pocket wallet.

434
00:23:06,723 --> 00:23:07,870
Speaker 0: You want to hear something crazy?

435
00:23:08,491 --> 00:23:12,385
Speaker 0: I knew a guy in middle school who wore his keys in his back pocket.

436
00:23:12,586 --> 00:23:14,715
Speaker 1: Whoa Didn't that poke him in the butt?

437
00:23:14,895 --> 00:23:15,819
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

438
00:23:16,161 --> 00:23:18,330
Speaker 0: Anyway, I would marvel at this kid.

439
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:20,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, you know what?

440
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:26,368
Speaker 1: I would consistently put the wallet in the front right pocket and whenever I sat down at a desk I would take it out and put on the desk.

441
00:23:26,794 --> 00:23:30,380
Speaker 1: But whenever I left the desk I put it back in that front right pocket where it was secure.

442
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,786
Speaker 1: I couldn't fall out.

443
00:23:31,826 --> 00:23:32,710
Speaker 0: Why would you take it out?

444
00:23:33,231 --> 00:23:33,452
Speaker 1: What?

445
00:23:33,593 --> 00:23:34,337
Speaker 0: why would you take it out?

446
00:23:34,398 --> 00:23:38,922
Speaker 1: Because when I'm at a desk usually with the computer I might often need the credit card for typing in.

447
00:23:38,942 --> 00:23:40,269
Speaker 0: I only get the wallet out.

448
00:23:40,289 --> 00:23:40,349
Speaker 0: see.

449
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:43,462
Speaker 1: Also, I hate sitting with a wallet in the pocket.

450
00:23:43,543 --> 00:23:44,910
Speaker 1: It's annoying even in the front pocket.

451
00:23:45,051 --> 00:23:45,554
Speaker 0: Here's the thing.

452
00:23:45,594 --> 00:23:58,550
Speaker 0: the real way to wear a wallet as I've always attested and as I now fortunately with my job get to do all the time if You're wearing a suit jacket or a blazer on the inside pocket put it in the blazer pocket.

453
00:23:58,711 --> 00:23:59,998
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't wear those though.

454
00:24:00,038 --> 00:24:02,230
Speaker 1: But when I do I was always.

455
00:24:03,173 --> 00:24:11,438
Speaker 1: I always feel rather dapper when I'm buying something at a store and it looks like you're gonna pull out a gun But then you pull out money, which is far more dangerous.

456
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:14,990
Speaker 0: not just reaching into the front pocket always feels very dapper.

457
00:24:15,211 --> 00:24:19,650
Speaker 1: Yes, I also enjoy the front pocket, but I do not have the front pocket in my club anyway.

458
00:24:20,731 --> 00:24:24,408
Speaker 1: So the wallet right and the keys and the cell phone are the same situation right.

459
00:24:24,529 --> 00:24:24,810
Speaker 1: I do.

460
00:24:25,032 --> 00:24:30,602
Speaker 1: I always put them in the same secure place I always take them out in the same manner and I always put them back in right.

461
00:24:30,983 --> 00:24:32,589
Speaker 1: so wallet phone keys is a lock.

462
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:42,130
Speaker 0: see now I think The issue with that it and in one hand creates a situation where you will very likely not ever lose it because you don't know Where it is, it's where you always put it exactly.

463
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:45,829
Speaker 0: But at the other time if anything disrupts your schedule you are fucked.

464
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:49,283
Speaker 0: If you like if something happens like your pants get you on fire.

465
00:24:49,504 --> 00:24:50,970
Speaker 0: you will never see any of those things again.

466
00:24:53,057 --> 00:24:57,190
Speaker 0: Even if you get them out of the pants, you're not gonna remember where you put them anyway.

467
00:24:58,511 --> 00:25:00,657
Speaker 1: That so the sunglasses right.

468
00:25:00,697 --> 00:25:01,840
Speaker 1: mistake number one.

469
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:03,244
Speaker 1: I wore them on.

470
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:06,897
Speaker 1: yeah two days ago when it was raining I thought it was gonna get sunny.

471
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:08,685
Speaker 1: So I wore him even though I usually wouldn't have.

472
00:25:08,927 --> 00:25:09,570
Speaker 0: that's another thing.

473
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:09,891
Speaker 0: Right.

474
00:25:10,292 --> 00:25:12,198
Speaker 1: the wallet every day no matter what.

475
00:25:12,298 --> 00:25:14,726
Speaker 1: the cell phone iPod no matter what every day.

476
00:25:14,766 --> 00:25:15,689
Speaker 1: the keys no matter what.

477
00:25:15,769 --> 00:25:18,868
Speaker 1: every day Right the sunglasses not every day.

478
00:25:19,952 --> 00:25:20,997
Speaker 0: So what other thing?

479
00:25:21,239 --> 00:25:22,928
Speaker 0: what now that I carry the messenger bag?

480
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,754
Speaker 0: Sunglasses are in there.

481
00:25:24,774 --> 00:25:25,417
Speaker 0: Mmm.

482
00:25:25,598 --> 00:25:28,550
Speaker 1: Well, you have the clip beyond sunglasses that can go in your bag.

483
00:25:28,832 --> 00:25:29,135
Speaker 1: I don't.

484
00:25:29,215 --> 00:25:29,679
Speaker 1: I thought you did.

485
00:25:29,941 --> 00:25:30,990
Speaker 0: I had those a long time ago.

486
00:25:31,272 --> 00:25:34,050
Speaker 0: I I have very nice custom-made sunglasses.

487
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:35,796
Speaker 1: How do you get them in the messenger bag though?

488
00:25:35,816 --> 00:25:38,386
Speaker 1: Because like when you fold up the Oakley's right?

489
00:25:38,406 --> 00:25:39,610
Speaker 1: They're sort of blob you list.

490
00:25:39,670 --> 00:25:41,441
Speaker 1: They don't really go in the messenger bag.

491
00:25:41,643 --> 00:25:42,850
Speaker 1: It's like they're gonna get crushed in there.

492
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,934
Speaker 0: I have a metal case.

493
00:25:43,975 --> 00:25:47,810
Speaker 0: That is the exact minimum size and shape to hold these custom sunglasses.

494
00:25:47,951 --> 00:25:48,574
Speaker 1: Oh, see the case.

495
00:25:48,614 --> 00:25:53,435
Speaker 1: the Oakley's coming is a giant blob that is not good for you know Carrying around in a messenger bag.

496
00:25:53,555 --> 00:25:56,847
Speaker 0: Well, it fits in my messenger bag in the slot right next to my DS.

497
00:25:57,449 --> 00:26:01,581
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, see these do not fit So I think I could not put them in the messenger.

498
00:26:01,742 --> 00:26:03,412
Speaker 0: if I carry them in the messenger bag You know what?

499
00:26:03,432 --> 00:26:05,609
Speaker 0: I can't put in the messenger bag, but books.

500
00:26:06,811 --> 00:26:08,558
Speaker 0: But what I could put would be a Kindle.

501
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:09,221
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

502
00:26:09,341 --> 00:26:11,149
Speaker 0: I really need a Kindle or the equivalent.

503
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:16,810
Speaker 1: Yep So anyway, I could not put these in the messenger bag because they are big and blah and they would get crushed.

504
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,570
Speaker 0: Why don't you get a special case for him and then put it on the clippy on the outside of the messenger?

505
00:26:21,710 --> 00:26:28,090
Speaker 1: Well, I was going to say that but I'm going to do now is of course I'm going to buy the expensive sunglasses again.

506
00:26:28,150 --> 00:26:36,602
Speaker 1: You need the bandolier on that bang and then I'm going to invent something which gives me the consistent and secure Storage place.

507
00:26:36,703 --> 00:26:43,670
Speaker 1: Okay, Scott Use that consistent and secure storage place even in the fucking winter that way to create the consistency necessary not to lose them.

508
00:26:43,691 --> 00:26:44,290
Speaker 0: Here's the problem.

509
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:46,929
Speaker 0: Now you're gonna be out somewhere with the sunglasses on.

510
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:52,250
Speaker 0: You'll be in a situation where you can't put it back into that exact configuration right then and it suddenly gets dark.

511
00:26:52,493 --> 00:26:53,305
Speaker 0: You'll never see him again.

512
00:26:54,254 --> 00:26:56,709
Speaker 0: Anyway, you'll set him like on top of your car.

513
00:26:57,593 --> 00:26:59,159
Speaker 1: So basically here's what happened.

514
00:26:59,219 --> 00:27:00,203
Speaker 1: right is that this is?

515
00:27:00,384 --> 00:27:01,990
Speaker 1: I sort of have this vague memory, right?

516
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:02,735
Speaker 1: Which is the problem?

517
00:27:02,756 --> 00:27:04,550
Speaker 1: if I had a clear memory of it, I would have found them.

518
00:27:04,570 --> 00:27:07,542
Speaker 0: But it's always that way if you ever lose anything you can always think back to like.

519
00:27:07,844 --> 00:27:11,890
Speaker 0: well I got home So I had the wallet when I got on the train.

520
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:20,477
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like first of all I couldn't remember if I wore them or not because like I was think I remember thinking in the morning Like should I wear them or shouldn't I wear them?

521
00:27:20,517 --> 00:27:25,034
Speaker 1: and I remember deciding yes, and I also remember deciding though I have two memories.

522
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,279
Speaker 1: They're probably from different days.

523
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,564
Speaker 1: They're both equally valid though.

524
00:27:27,664 --> 00:27:29,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're both equally valid memories.

525
00:27:29,130 --> 00:27:30,580
Speaker 1: It is, you know from different days.

526
00:27:30,620 --> 00:27:41,480
Speaker 1: I don't know which one went with which day But obviously the memory of wearing them went with that day because they weren't still in the case when I got home Unless someone came in the house and stole them out of the case.

527
00:27:42,062 --> 00:27:42,865
Speaker 1: That's not where they were.

528
00:27:42,945 --> 00:27:49,646
Speaker 1: so memory too I have was when I got out of the car at the beacon train station, and it was raining.

529
00:27:50,107 --> 00:27:57,880
Speaker 1: I sort of remember Maybe putting them on my head or maybe putting them down low I don't remember, but they were not anywhere at the beacon train station.

530
00:27:59,044 --> 00:28:10,182
Speaker 1: and then I had another memory of At the Grand Central Station when I got out of the terminal onto the street in the city I remember putting my hood on because it was raining.

531
00:28:10,202 --> 00:28:16,410
Speaker 1: and I remember thinking ah Because putting the hood on when the sunglasses on your head it sucks, right?

532
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:18,676
Speaker 1: So I have two different memories of that.

533
00:28:18,856 --> 00:28:21,887
Speaker 1: one memory is I'm glad I didn't bring my sunglasses today.

534
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:23,573
Speaker 1: putting on my head Hood is so comfortable.

535
00:28:24,296 --> 00:28:28,068
Speaker 1: and the other memory I have is uh, why are my sunglasses with the hood?

536
00:28:28,129 --> 00:28:28,952
Speaker 1: I hate this It sucks.

537
00:28:28,972 --> 00:28:33,548
Speaker 1: I'm gonna take my sunglasses off and put them down low somewhere and then I don't remember where they went.

538
00:28:33,608 --> 00:28:46,324
Speaker 1: and then basically from then on the next memory was leaving work where I got up to leave my desk at work and I Examine the desk to make sure didn't leave anything there and there were no sunglasses.

539
00:28:46,344 --> 00:28:47,809
Speaker 0: No, it's like fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck.

540
00:28:48,911 --> 00:28:50,135
Speaker 1: And I was like did I bring them?

541
00:28:50,155 --> 00:28:51,599
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

542
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,344
Speaker 1: are they really not around here?

543
00:28:53,805 --> 00:28:54,146
Speaker 0: fuck?

544
00:28:54,788 --> 00:28:56,715
Speaker 1: and then it was like They're gonna be on my up.

545
00:28:57,036 --> 00:28:58,260
Speaker 1: I guess I didn't bring them.

546
00:28:58,681 --> 00:28:59,825
Speaker 1: they're on my desk at home.

547
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:01,150
Speaker 1: get home not there.

548
00:29:02,272 --> 00:29:03,500
Speaker 1: Fuck again, that's the worst cuz.

549
00:29:03,540 --> 00:29:04,789
Speaker 0: now you're the whole day.

550
00:29:04,849 --> 00:29:06,780
Speaker 0: now You're thinking gotta get home to see.

551
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,349
Speaker 0: if they're there gotta go home to see.

552
00:29:08,369 --> 00:29:11,590
Speaker 1: well It was as I left work at five o'clock the whole day nothing.

553
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:13,677
Speaker 1: Nah while I was working didn't even think.

554
00:29:13,778 --> 00:29:15,544
Speaker 1: not, you know completely out of mind.

555
00:29:15,564 --> 00:29:17,270
Speaker 0: see at least I read in recent.

556
00:29:17,471 --> 00:29:22,970
Speaker 0: I have not lost anything really at all recently, but I have had a few close calls.

557
00:29:23,271 --> 00:29:23,552
Speaker 0: I did.

558
00:29:23,632 --> 00:29:23,913
Speaker 1: I did.

559
00:29:23,993 --> 00:29:28,468
Speaker 1: I did a send a report to the Grand Central lost and found which is a 60% return rate.

560
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,822
Speaker 1: But you know, that's assuming I love to make Grand Central or the train.

561
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:34,668
Speaker 0: Yep, and someone didn't just go.

562
00:29:34,708 --> 00:29:37,950
Speaker 1: Hey sunglasses Yeah, I mean if I would have seen those on the street out of it like fuck.

563
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:41,202
Speaker 1: Yes, like I sort of had this a fantasy of.

564
00:29:41,523 --> 00:29:42,948
Speaker 1: maybe I'll see a homeless guy, right?

565
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:44,256
Speaker 1: Who's wearing them?

566
00:29:44,276 --> 00:29:45,770
Speaker 1: and they're obviously mine cuz they're custom.

567
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:46,292
Speaker 1: so I can.

568
00:29:46,452 --> 00:29:49,603
Speaker 1: there's no way that the odds of identical ones are extremely low.

569
00:29:50,124 --> 00:29:51,007
Speaker 1: and I just be like.

570
00:29:51,027 --> 00:29:56,288
Speaker 1: I Imagine that if the homeless guy admitted that they were mine, I would have let him keep them.

571
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:01,370
Speaker 0: That's very Ultima quest of the Avatar exactly.

572
00:30:01,712 --> 00:30:05,110
Speaker 1: But if he would have been all indignant homeless guy would have gotten a cop and tried to get him back.

573
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:06,236
Speaker 1: But I don't know what I could have done.

574
00:30:06,758 --> 00:30:08,949
Speaker 1: What kind of recourse is there in that case?

575
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:13,130
Speaker 1: You could probably I mean I can prove that I bought ones that were that color.

576
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:15,936
Speaker 1: Cuz I have the I can go get the receipt and they're custom.

577
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:20,499
Speaker 1: So that's sort of almost Reasonable doubt that those are mine.

578
00:30:21,242 --> 00:30:27,269
Speaker 1: But it's you know, I mean there could sadly very sadly because the way because the guy's homeless I'd probably just get him back.

579
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:28,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, that that's what I was about to say.

580
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:34,357
Speaker 0: Yeah, well now wouldn't it suck if that guy saved up the money actually bought the exact same custom.

581
00:30:34,437 --> 00:30:36,584
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah How do you feel about that?

582
00:30:36,784 --> 00:30:39,192
Speaker 1: The thing is I figured this way right.

583
00:30:39,713 --> 00:30:40,897
Speaker 0: and what if his name was like Sam?

584
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:43,596
Speaker 0: Robin-stein?

585
00:30:43,616 --> 00:30:50,160
Speaker 1: so No, I just had the polar the default inscription on there because I wasn't gonna pay extra for that film monogram.

586
00:30:50,461 --> 00:31:06,202
Speaker 1: No, but I figure right I'm gonna buy another one if I lose the second pair game over fuck it That's right, cuz you know, but I figure hey worst case I'm back to square one, but I have an extra carrying case and an extra cleaning cloth and You know what?

587
00:31:06,282 --> 00:31:09,335
Speaker 1: I've spent more on less in my life, right?

588
00:31:09,395 --> 00:31:14,290
Speaker 1: I've lost worse Like five $50 time X's.

589
00:31:14,331 --> 00:31:16,240
Speaker 1: that's more money than the one sunglass.

590
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:24,500
Speaker 0: You know the feeling where you lose something and it's entirely or just you screw something up It's entirely your fault and you can point at the exact monetary damage you cause to yourself.

591
00:31:24,701 --> 00:31:26,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you have that feeling of.

592
00:31:26,247 --> 00:31:30,905
Speaker 1: but if you but if you if you feel bad over it You're basically just doing more damage.

593
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:31,227
Speaker 1: Yep.

594
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:34,680
Speaker 0: Yep, but there's still that feeling and you can't a hundred percent escape it, right?

595
00:31:35,180 --> 00:31:37,629
Speaker 1: But I mean if I lose the second pair, that's it.

596
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:39,616
Speaker 1: I'm back to the $20 sunglasses.

597
00:31:39,957 --> 00:31:40,680
Speaker 1: We're done, right?

598
00:31:41,661 --> 00:31:46,575
Speaker 1: But I'm gonna get the second pair and I'm also going to invent a way to not lose them.

599
00:31:46,675 --> 00:31:51,071
Speaker 0: You know what I've Only the only time I've ever lost a pair of sunglasses.

600
00:31:51,111 --> 00:32:01,566
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is you're a glasses kneading person So it's completely different for you if I needed to wear them not because one clip-ons which I used to use There's no need for that.

601
00:32:01,606 --> 00:32:02,491
Speaker 0: It's just sunglasses.

602
00:32:02,571 --> 00:32:03,375
Speaker 0: It's like putting them on.

603
00:32:03,395 --> 00:32:04,742
Speaker 0: you don't think to use them They're not.

604
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,307
Speaker 0: you know, it's the same deal.

605
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:09,720
Speaker 0: You don't have a sunglasses instinct separate from the glasses instinct.

606
00:32:10,182 --> 00:32:13,979
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I mean your sunglasses are prescription and you would if you wear them you just hang on.

607
00:32:14,162 --> 00:32:18,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, they are, you know There was a time when I use clip-ons instead in which case those are easy to lose.

608
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:24,332
Speaker 0: But the only time I ever lost them was when I left them in a diner Right when we graduated from our IT.

609
00:32:24,392 --> 00:32:28,020
Speaker 0: I As I walked out I went oh crap my sunglasses.

610
00:32:28,541 --> 00:32:29,384
Speaker 0: I walked back in.

611
00:32:29,725 --> 00:32:32,233
Speaker 0: there was another family there and they they.

612
00:32:32,253 --> 00:32:34,440
Speaker 0: I am so sure that they just took them.

613
00:32:35,284 --> 00:32:36,008
Speaker 1: Oh, I remember this.

614
00:32:36,028 --> 00:32:38,280
Speaker 0: I'm absolutely sure I remember this story.

615
00:32:38,561 --> 00:32:43,207
Speaker 0: We forgot about the waiters like yes, I'm there and the waiters like yes I'm there to the family.

616
00:32:43,247 --> 00:32:44,698
Speaker 0: The family's like we didn't see nothing.

617
00:32:47,343 --> 00:32:48,469
Speaker 1: You should have gotten the police then.

618
00:32:48,489 --> 00:32:50,760
Speaker 0: it wasn't where it did take.

619
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,603
Speaker 0: You know what.

620
00:32:51,684 --> 00:32:57,426
Speaker 0: as much as I enjoy watching the righteously indignant or people of that ilk squirm Especially then you had no money.

621
00:32:57,447 --> 00:32:58,632
Speaker 0: It is so.

622
00:32:58,672 --> 00:33:00,380
Speaker 0: no then I had a decent bit of money.

623
00:33:00,601 --> 00:33:02,648
Speaker 0: Okay, cuz remember I was working at IBM.

624
00:33:02,768 --> 00:33:05,316
Speaker 0: I drove back to our IT to quote-unquote.

625
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:05,457
Speaker 1: Okay.

626
00:33:05,477 --> 00:33:06,320
Speaker 1: I thought this is pre.

627
00:33:06,742 --> 00:33:07,625
Speaker 1: This is the okay.

628
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:08,148
Speaker 0: No, that was.

629
00:33:08,188 --> 00:33:09,353
Speaker 0: that was when I had so much money.

630
00:33:09,373 --> 00:33:10,136
Speaker 0: I didn't care anymore.

631
00:33:10,156 --> 00:33:19,091
Speaker 0: All right, but The only time I really like I've had a lot of close calls Mostly with keys or wallet was he is a thing right.

632
00:33:19,171 --> 00:33:23,867
Speaker 1: losing something is not the same as a close call And it's not the same as leaving something somewhere.

633
00:33:23,907 --> 00:33:28,120
Speaker 1: like sometimes you might leave something at someone's house or you get something behind.

634
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:30,980
Speaker 1: It's not the same as losing it right like for example.

635
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:34,920
Speaker 1: But I've left things in hotels and then later called the hotel and had the mail it.

636
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:42,691
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's the same situation because recently when I actually lost something that mattered I lost my keys while I went out for a run.

637
00:33:42,711 --> 00:33:45,080
Speaker 0: Oh shit because there was a hole in my pocket.

638
00:33:45,402 --> 00:33:45,683
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

639
00:33:45,764 --> 00:33:46,347
Speaker 0: I went for a run.

640
00:33:46,408 --> 00:33:46,830
Speaker 0: I get home.

641
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:48,560
Speaker 0: I go open the door doors locked.

642
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,872
Speaker 0: I'm like, let me just get my there's a hole in my pocket.

643
00:33:53,478 --> 00:33:56,528
Speaker 0: Ah And I'm thinking I'm picturing my keys.

644
00:33:56,789 --> 00:33:59,779
Speaker 0: and when I'm picturing my keys, I'm thinking keys to my car.

645
00:34:00,302 --> 00:34:01,911
Speaker 0: Well, I got to get a new set of those.

646
00:34:02,394 --> 00:34:03,359
Speaker 0: He's to Emily's car.

647
00:34:03,922 --> 00:34:13,388
Speaker 1: Well Yubikey great, yeah RSA key fuck I Got some more Yubikeys in the in the room.

648
00:34:13,408 --> 00:34:14,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, I convinced my coworker to buy one.

649
00:34:15,275 --> 00:34:15,797
Speaker 0: He's loving it.

650
00:34:16,058 --> 00:34:16,420
Speaker 1: All right.

651
00:34:17,224 --> 00:34:18,351
Speaker 0: So what do I do?

652
00:34:18,371 --> 00:34:19,478
Speaker 0: I spend the next hour?

653
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:23,257
Speaker 0: Retracing my steps in the dark with a flashlight.

654
00:34:23,277 --> 00:34:23,780
Speaker 1: you find them.

655
00:34:24,121 --> 00:34:27,353
Speaker 0: I found them a mile and a half away from the house on the sidewalk.

656
00:34:27,634 --> 00:34:27,935
Speaker 0: Awesome.

657
00:34:28,076 --> 00:34:29,139
Speaker 0: I was very pleased with that.

658
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:31,034
Speaker 1: That's not losing though.

659
00:34:31,054 --> 00:34:32,882
Speaker 0: Yeah Losing.

660
00:34:32,962 --> 00:34:36,657
Speaker 0: I almost always have close calls, but it's rare that I lose something.

661
00:34:36,717 --> 00:34:41,559
Speaker 0: that matters Yeah, but the one time I did the one time was in middle school.

662
00:34:42,342 --> 00:34:43,726
Speaker 0: Well, there wasn't middle school.

663
00:34:44,228 --> 00:34:44,969
Speaker 0: No, it was high school.

664
00:34:45,010 --> 00:34:47,056
Speaker 0: It was definitely high school because I have a driver's license.

665
00:34:47,397 --> 00:34:51,373
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I was biking and I was wearing my trench coat.

666
00:34:51,413 --> 00:34:53,100
Speaker 0: because I wore my trench coat everywhere.

667
00:34:53,139 --> 00:35:01,800
Speaker 0: Remember I even wore that thing at RIT like all the time along with that cowboy hat yeah, and I used to always keep my keys and wallet in these unsecured.

668
00:35:02,202 --> 00:35:05,475
Speaker 0: Don't zip up front pockets that were like four inches deep.

669
00:35:05,575 --> 00:35:06,800
Speaker 1: You had all those inside pockets.

670
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:07,562
Speaker 1: They didn't use those.

671
00:35:07,642 --> 00:35:08,525
Speaker 1: use the outside one.

672
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:09,207
Speaker 0: Well, they were.

673
00:35:09,267 --> 00:35:13,359
Speaker 0: they were inside really, but they didn't have anything securing items in them at all.

674
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:19,900
Speaker 0: So and you know and I think back it was inevitable that I would have lost anything I ever put in those pockets.

675
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:24,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, like they're in the fact that I did you put like cans of coke in there and shit.

676
00:35:24,562 --> 00:35:32,600
Speaker 0: I remember proving at RIT when Greg didn't believe me that I could fit an Entire 12-pack of soda in that trench coat with no visible bulges.

677
00:35:33,722 --> 00:35:36,956
Speaker 0: You did and walk not very fast mind you but I could walk.

678
00:35:37,137 --> 00:35:37,860
Speaker 1: Here's the thing, right?

679
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:38,943
Speaker 1: I mean, why was it?

680
00:35:39,023 --> 00:35:40,789
Speaker 1: I don't understand why that was so unbelievable.

681
00:35:40,870 --> 00:35:43,800
Speaker 1: people store like like three shotguns in a coat.

682
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,355
Speaker 0: Like you remember that video with the kid?

683
00:35:45,637 --> 00:35:51,300
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, it's like if you can put three shotguns in a coat, you can put six cans of coke in a coat.

684
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,600
Speaker 0: I think it was primarily remember way back when we were all at RIT.

685
00:35:54,821 --> 00:35:55,242
Speaker 0: I think it was.

686
00:35:55,503 --> 00:36:02,970
Speaker 0: I think it was actually very similar or in the same era of when we watched that one episode of Malcolm in the middle with the peeps.

687
00:36:03,452 --> 00:36:03,814
Speaker 1: peeps.

688
00:36:03,854 --> 00:36:05,039
Speaker 0: You can't eat a hundred peeps.

689
00:36:11,627 --> 00:36:18,291
Speaker 0: I lost both my keys and my wallet Keys and wallet both same day.

690
00:36:18,311 --> 00:36:20,216
Speaker 0: they gone gone gone forever.

691
00:36:20,496 --> 00:36:21,800
Speaker 0: and the worst thing is the keys.

692
00:36:22,241 --> 00:36:24,530
Speaker 0: I was really bummed because the keys had a key fob on them.

693
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:28,342
Speaker 0: That was a pewter dragon pocket watch Uh-huh.

694
00:36:28,442 --> 00:36:29,365
Speaker 0: It was so cool.

695
00:36:29,465 --> 00:36:30,207
Speaker 0: I love that thing.

696
00:36:30,529 --> 00:36:31,171
Speaker 1: It's gone now.

697
00:36:31,351 --> 00:36:37,612
Speaker 0: Yep, and the wallet was well my wallet And that was one, you know, I went home like mom.

698
00:36:37,633 --> 00:36:40,878
Speaker 0: I lost my keys and she's like I was like and my wallet she was like.

699
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:44,789
Speaker 1: ah Thing is I've lost walls before.

700
00:36:45,452 --> 00:36:51,276
Speaker 1: it's not a real big in people like oh my god I mean, I basically just went to the credit card website disabled the car.

701
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:52,160
Speaker 1: They sent me a new one.

702
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:53,244
Speaker 1: It took one click.

703
00:36:53,405 --> 00:36:53,646
Speaker 0: right.

704
00:36:53,706 --> 00:36:57,160
Speaker 1: see it's much like to the DMV the new driver's license one click.

705
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:58,906
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's so easy.

706
00:36:58,946 --> 00:37:02,920
Speaker 0: back then, you know and up until very recently wallet losing wouldn't have been a big deal.

707
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:14,019
Speaker 0: But now I would have two credit cards ATM card like for insurance cards car insurance car registration Driver's license my insurance and registration in my car.

708
00:37:15,302 --> 00:37:17,840
Speaker 0: Yes, I also carry my insurance and registration in the wallet.

709
00:37:18,001 --> 00:37:18,484
Speaker 1: I did not.

710
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:21,140
Speaker 0: everyone else in the world does that at least everyone else in the country?

711
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:21,601
Speaker 1: I do not.

712
00:37:21,621 --> 00:37:24,075
Speaker 0: New York's all weird with the registration like taped to the window.

713
00:37:24,115 --> 00:37:24,880
Speaker 0: I never got used to that.

714
00:37:25,524 --> 00:37:26,874
Speaker 1: That's how it is in Connecticut.

715
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:27,660
Speaker 0: I know it's weird.

716
00:37:28,822 --> 00:37:33,080
Speaker 1: And also Connecticut also does a sticker on the license plate that has just the date.

717
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:34,287
Speaker 0: Yeah, Michigan used to that way.

718
00:37:34,307 --> 00:37:39,059
Speaker 1: cops can see from afar if you're up to date Yep, and actually they mail you that sticker in the mail.

719
00:37:39,381 --> 00:37:43,940
Speaker 0: But most importantly now train ticket because here's here's the situation in the city.

720
00:37:44,582 --> 00:37:45,424
Speaker 0: Lose wallet.

721
00:37:45,825 --> 00:37:46,186
Speaker 0: All right.

722
00:37:46,567 --> 00:37:47,670
Speaker 0: I can't get any money.

723
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,595
Speaker 0: I don't have any money.

724
00:37:49,615 --> 00:37:51,500
Speaker 0: I don't have a train ticket home.

725
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,913
Speaker 0: I've lost the time to buy the train ticket.

726
00:37:53,974 --> 00:37:55,080
Speaker 1: I lost the training one.

727
00:37:55,221 --> 00:37:58,540
Speaker 0: I don't have the ID to give the conductor to pay him later.

728
00:37:59,262 --> 00:38:04,500
Speaker 1: I lost the train ticket once because I bought basically a web ticket which is flimsy ass piece of paper.

729
00:38:04,641 --> 00:38:06,067
Speaker 1: Yeah, I lost it halfway through the.

730
00:38:06,107 --> 00:38:06,649
Speaker 0: what do you do?

731
00:38:06,709 --> 00:38:07,653
Speaker 0: You're about to leave work.

732
00:38:07,794 --> 00:38:08,758
Speaker 0: You don't have your wallet.

733
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:14,460
Speaker 0: You basically have to go to the conductor and at his mercy be like look I lost my wallet.

734
00:38:14,983 --> 00:38:16,593
Speaker 0: I don't have any collateral to give you.

735
00:38:16,673 --> 00:38:20,506
Speaker 0: I guess I could give you my DS And then you get home.

736
00:38:20,727 --> 00:38:25,894
Speaker 0: you still have to get a new train ticket, yep Train tickets are like cash man.

737
00:38:25,914 --> 00:38:26,600
Speaker 1: That's the thing, right?

738
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:28,126
Speaker 1: That's why Galaxy Express is.

739
00:38:28,266 --> 00:38:41,679
Speaker 1: I can identify with it so much because the pass the pass ooh the Galaxy Express ticket is such this point of drama and like half the episodes because basically If you don't have it, you can't get on the train.

740
00:38:42,282 --> 00:38:46,959
Speaker 1: Otherwise they kill you this penalty of death right if someone takes your ticket.

741
00:38:46,999 --> 00:38:47,280
Speaker 1: That's it.

742
00:38:47,340 --> 00:39:01,588
Speaker 1: they're on the train and you're not right and like you have to basically get off the train and all these stops and you pretty much have to like hold on to that thing For dear life and people are constantly trying to steal it and it cost a bajillion dollars And such and such.

743
00:39:01,608 --> 00:39:03,760
Speaker 1: and you only have one and it's like oh my gosh.

744
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:09,400
Speaker 1: And it's like wow, it's exactly the same as all my train tickets and wallets and whatnot, you know.

745
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,026
Speaker 1: And it's so.

746
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:10,854
Speaker 1: it's just so true.

747
00:39:10,874 --> 00:39:23,280
Speaker 0: Yep But I actually the way I handle this pretty much as I just have a shoebox a really nice one that I put out And I put all my items of note that would be decanted from my pockets when I come home there.

748
00:39:23,762 --> 00:39:27,700
Speaker 0: So I have a spot to put all my change spot to put all my bills and a little thing to put my cell phone.

749
00:39:28,042 --> 00:39:31,200
Speaker 1: I can't on to my desk and then I decant off of the desk.

750
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,925
Speaker 1: So the the desk itself is the.

751
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:40,940
Speaker 0: well the problem with that is that I need my keys which have my RSA key Whenever I need to do work stuff or log into the VPN and I need the YubiKey.

752
00:39:41,383 --> 00:39:43,378
Speaker 0: So I need these when I'm at the computer pretty often.

753
00:39:43,418 --> 00:39:47,053
Speaker 0: now I need my cell phone around a lot because I'm making a lot of calls.

754
00:39:47,073 --> 00:39:48,057
Speaker 0: No doing this house stuff.

755
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:49,343
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Plus.

756
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:50,429
Speaker 0: I got to charge the stupid thing.

757
00:39:50,449 --> 00:39:51,314
Speaker 0: I don't have my pre yet.

758
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,014
Speaker 1: with my touchstone You're gonna get the stupid touchstone.

759
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:59,480
Speaker 0: Probably not I. I'm actually 50/50 right now between the pre and the new iPhone.

760
00:39:59,561 --> 00:40:02,660
Speaker 1: I would wait for the pre roundtable podcast to make a decision.

761
00:40:02,861 --> 00:40:07,160
Speaker 0: Well, I can't buy one until the 30th which is when my contract expires.

762
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,350
Speaker 1: The roundtable should be out in a couple in a day or two.

763
00:40:09,370 --> 00:40:12,931
Speaker 0: So maybe it's even out now, but right now I'm ambivalent one of the other.

764
00:40:12,951 --> 00:40:18,152
Speaker 0: Yep Okay, yeah, I wish I could get.

765
00:40:18,232 --> 00:40:19,840
Speaker 0: I mean I lost my cell phone a bunch of times.

766
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:21,429
Speaker 0: Never lost a cell phone or an iPod.

767
00:40:23,661 --> 00:40:30,930
Speaker 0: well Kate I remember she lost her cell phone somewhere on RIT's campus in the winter and She came back the next day.

768
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:31,999
Speaker 0: She's like I lost my cell phone.

769
00:40:32,461 --> 00:40:44,592
Speaker 0: So I just took our landline and had the redial and while I was playing a game I just kept hitting redial while she watered her on RIT's campus and like an hour later She found the phone ringing buried in snow and it was fine.

770
00:40:44,612 --> 00:40:46,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was pretty cool.

771
00:40:47,023 --> 00:40:50,620
Speaker 1: But now did you see how Apple actually on the new iPhone?

772
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:59,092
Speaker 1: Mobile me right if you have mobile me, you can find your iPhone You can delete it or disable it remotely etc.

773
00:40:59,112 --> 00:41:00,900
Speaker 0: It said now the pre should just offer that for free.

774
00:41:01,422 --> 00:41:05,999
Speaker 1: yeah, well, yeah, first of all every phone has to offer that now every phone with the GPS right.

775
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:10,351
Speaker 1: and Second of all, I think we need to start having a way to like.

776
00:41:10,813 --> 00:41:13,060
Speaker 1: why can't I GPS them sunglasses, right?

777
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,100
Speaker 1: I mean it does.

778
00:41:15,023 --> 00:41:18,974
Speaker 0: You would need to have some sort of GPS device on the sunglasses.

779
00:41:18,994 --> 00:41:20,257
Speaker 1: Well, that's true Howard.

780
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:21,180
Speaker 1: That's true.

781
00:41:22,223 --> 00:41:26,055
Speaker 0: Also also able also a cell device so it can communicate its location.

782
00:41:26,376 --> 00:41:29,225
Speaker 0: GPS is not to way No, but it could be.

783
00:41:29,305 --> 00:41:41,440
Speaker 1: so we need we should invent what it's sort of like an RFID of GPS Where the device itself has no GPS abilities, but it can be located by a GPS.

784
00:41:41,821 --> 00:41:42,885
Speaker 1: That's looking for it.

785
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:44,971
Speaker 0: that's not feasible really.

786
00:41:45,031 --> 00:41:46,275
Speaker 0: just by the way the technologies work.

787
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:47,780
Speaker 0: the best you could do is have a transponder.

788
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,367
Speaker 1: That's why we need to invent it.

789
00:41:49,850 --> 00:41:50,734
Speaker 0: What do you mean invented?

790
00:41:50,975 --> 00:41:51,919
Speaker 0: How are you going to do that?

791
00:41:52,561 --> 00:41:53,916
Speaker 1: Invent something new?

792
00:41:54,742 --> 00:41:58,715
Speaker 0: But Scott, all right, so it's gonna figure out its location with GPS.

793
00:41:58,735 --> 00:42:08,747
Speaker 1: No, it's not figure out its location It's just it has some sort of powerless thing attached to it such that it can be located Electronically by something else.

794
00:42:09,169 --> 00:42:10,595
Speaker 0: Okay, so stop saying GPS.

795
00:42:10,636 --> 00:42:11,560
Speaker 0: that has nothing to do with it.

796
00:42:11,741 --> 00:42:14,519
Speaker 1: I'm just saying I know has nothing to do with GPS, but you know what I'm saying?

797
00:42:15,020 --> 00:42:16,027
Speaker 0: It's called RFID.

798
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:28,700
Speaker 1: The problem is you would you would have to Imagine the RF it would take to find the sunglasses from space ID on them like burn a hole right through the earth disintegrating the sunglasses.

799
00:42:29,303 --> 00:42:40,037
Speaker 0: I think it is technologically infeasible within the next 15 or 20 years Yeah, I don't know 15 maybe you know sort of some sort of mesh network and then some sort of shizuma device to put in It to power it.

800
00:42:41,182 --> 00:42:44,220
Speaker 1: I'm just you know, it's something to think about for all those inventors out there.

801
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,320
Speaker 1: Yes, wait a way to tag things such that they can be found.

802
00:42:47,542 --> 00:42:49,980
Speaker 1: You know, it doesn't even have to be like find it from space, right?

803
00:42:50,020 --> 00:42:56,812
Speaker 1: It could be like I know I left it maybe at you know I would have maybe either at this train station or the next one or whatever.

804
00:42:56,852 --> 00:42:59,440
Speaker 1: So maybe here's the problem a hundred foot radius.

805
00:43:00,881 --> 00:43:02,245
Speaker 0: Here's why this is so infeasible.

806
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:13,300
Speaker 0: if it if it has to get its power from the thing that is going to find it you're really stuck with RF or something at the equivalent or Something that has not been invented yet.

807
00:43:13,380 --> 00:43:20,422
Speaker 0: No, you either have to transmit the power to it somehow or it has to already have the power Or it could be like, you know Like what?

808
00:43:20,522 --> 00:43:27,358
Speaker 1: like a metal detector where you can just sort of like detect it just needs to be detectable Scott You know how metal detectors work, right?

809
00:43:28,321 --> 00:43:40,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, yeah If you lose something metal About the totes I could have found the $20 plus sunglasses that were made of metal But not the plastic ones.

810
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:42,297
Speaker 1: Actually, they're not plastic.

811
00:43:42,317 --> 00:43:44,394
Speaker 1: They're made of unobtainium.

812
00:43:46,807 --> 00:43:48,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, actually you see that new element.

813
00:43:49,181 --> 00:43:49,984
Speaker 1: It doesn't have a name yet.

814
00:43:50,286 --> 00:43:51,691
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they should caught.

815
00:43:51,711 --> 00:43:54,040
Speaker 1: they should call it on a nun a nun a nun a millennium.

816
00:43:54,483 --> 00:43:55,249
Speaker 0: I like those names.

817
00:43:55,491 --> 00:44:01,762
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time I like it when you give them a cool name Nubian.

818
00:44:01,843 --> 00:44:03,130
Speaker 1: the thing is you already have rubinium.

819
00:44:03,331 --> 00:44:04,035
Speaker 0: Just make it Nubian.

820
00:44:04,095 --> 00:44:04,779
Speaker 1: So I'm done.

821
00:44:06,842 --> 00:44:08,496
Speaker 1: We're good, we got it.

822
00:44:09,564 --> 00:44:09,868
Speaker 1: You got.

823
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:10,619
Speaker 1: thanks Jay coverage.

824
00:44:11,501 --> 00:44:13,146
Speaker 1: Notice how they don't have to cost ernium.

825
00:44:13,166 --> 00:44:13,728
Speaker 0: That's common.

826
00:44:14,250 --> 00:44:14,571
Speaker 1: Yeah.

827
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:18,101
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm waiting for the you ready for number 500.

828
00:44:18,101 --> 00:44:20,291
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for the next island of stability.

829
00:44:20,733 --> 00:44:21,075
Speaker 0: Sure.

830
00:44:21,255 --> 00:44:22,200
Speaker 0: Plus what about a lyrium?

831
00:44:25,127 --> 00:44:29,666
Speaker 0: Uh, but you're not a leer you All right, this is kind of Peter.

832
00:44:29,727 --> 00:44:30,450
Speaker 0: not I don't know.

833
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:32,116
Speaker 0: we really had to say anything else.

834
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,903
Speaker 1: that has been lost I don't know.

835
00:44:34,465 --> 00:44:35,730
Speaker 1: lost and founds are cool.

836
00:44:35,791 --> 00:44:36,895
Speaker 1: You should make use of them.

837
00:44:37,076 --> 00:44:38,923
Speaker 0: Remember remember way back I lost that.

838
00:44:38,984 --> 00:44:47,980
Speaker 0: basically I had that brazier cell phone forever Mm-hmm, and then I lost it that one day and I called it and a dude answered and then I got my phone back.

839
00:44:48,261 --> 00:44:48,703
Speaker 1: Oh, right.

840
00:44:48,723 --> 00:44:50,129
Speaker 0: Yeah overnighted it to me.

841
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,074
Speaker 1: You find some other dudes.

842
00:44:51,094 --> 00:44:52,420
Speaker 1: blackberry never give it back to him.

843
00:44:52,601 --> 00:44:54,332
Speaker 0: Yeah, I kept meaning to like.

844
00:44:54,392 --> 00:44:55,036
Speaker 0: I found like.

845
00:44:55,076 --> 00:44:56,960
Speaker 0: I looked into it I found all the email addresses in it.

846
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,219
Speaker 0: So I just emailed all of them and I was like I found this blackberry and it's this guy's name.

847
00:45:02,481 --> 00:45:04,068
Speaker 0: Tell him and I'll give it to him.

848
00:45:04,128 --> 00:45:05,274
Speaker 0: Here's my contact info.

849
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:06,680
Speaker 0: No one ever responded.

850
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:08,366
Speaker 0: Eventually, the blackberry ran out of battery.

851
00:45:08,948 --> 00:45:10,072
Speaker 0: Then I put it in a drawer.

852
00:45:10,133 --> 00:45:11,658
Speaker 0: I forgot about it for like two years.

853
00:45:13,141 --> 00:45:13,704
Speaker 1: Just sell it.

854
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:20,983
Speaker 0: Yeah, I found it later and I was like, whoa too little too late I Don't know.

855
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:22,169
Speaker 0: I should just turn.

856
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,999
Speaker 0: I just like lose it in Grand Central.

857
00:45:24,961 --> 00:45:25,964
Speaker 0: Yeah donated somewhere.

858
00:45:25,984 --> 00:45:27,449
Speaker 0: I don't know when you work to the hospital.

859
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:29,295
Speaker 1: Didn't you have the incredibly old-school blackberry?

860
00:45:29,696 --> 00:45:32,243
Speaker 0: No, I had a pager One way.

861
00:45:32,263 --> 00:45:34,854
Speaker 1: but the original blackberry was effectively a pager wasn't it?

862
00:45:35,015 --> 00:45:35,778
Speaker 1: Like you just had some.

863
00:45:35,818 --> 00:45:38,351
Speaker 0: but no I had an alphanumeric pager at the hospital.

864
00:45:38,371 --> 00:45:38,733
Speaker 0: You know what?

865
00:45:38,954 --> 00:45:40,260
Speaker 0: I lost that right?

866
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:46,433
Speaker 0: I lost that like a week after I got there and No one ever paged me anyway, so it didn't matter.

867
00:45:46,794 --> 00:45:50,379
Speaker 0: and when I quit I was like, yeah I lost that pager and they're like, oh you're gonna have to pay for it.

868
00:45:50,841 --> 00:45:55,038
Speaker 0: And I said sure how much and they couldn't figure out how much and they never asked me again.

869
00:45:55,299 --> 00:45:58,619
Speaker 0: Good The thing was worth about five bucks.

870
00:45:59,762 --> 00:46:01,277
Speaker 0: Yep, it took double A's.

871
00:46:01,881 --> 00:46:11,679
Speaker 1: so either I'm gonna have one sunglass that cost twice as much but came with extra accessories or Maybe someone will find it at Grand Central and I'll have to.

872
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:15,335
Speaker 0: ah That'd be crazy only two at twice the price.

873
00:46:15,657 --> 00:46:18,293
Speaker 0: Yeah All right, this Peter dad.

874
00:46:18,334 --> 00:46:19,018
Speaker 0: I think we're done.

875
00:46:19,058 --> 00:46:19,380
Speaker 1: We're done.

876
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:23,616
Speaker 0: We'll pick up next week with mocha coverage, which will be a good episode and a crazy episode.

877
00:46:23,676 --> 00:46:24,660
Speaker 1: might it to be extra long?

878
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:27,710
Speaker 0: Yeah, and Monday, there's so much tech news.

879
00:46:27,750 --> 00:46:28,713
Speaker 0: Well, we got some stuff.

880
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:30,640
Speaker 1: It might just round it up even though I don't wanna.

881
00:46:30,862 --> 00:46:32,099
Speaker 1: No, we got we'll see.

882
