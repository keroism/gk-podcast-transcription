1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,720
Speaker 0: All right, welcome to Geek Nights Special #1.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,460
Speaker 1: As promised, we're doing a special weekend podcast because we didn't do one on Thursday.

3
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:16,200
Speaker 0: Now, we didn't do one on Thursday for, well, we said we had a certain reason, but we ended up having a completely different reason, which we'll talk about on Monday.

4
00:00:16,981 --> 00:00:18,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, two or three reasons, yeah.

5
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,280
Speaker 0: Anyway, since this is the first one, I'll do a little bit of explaining.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:26,479
Speaker 0: Now, normally Geek Nights is four nights a week, Monday through Thursday, and every day is a different topic.

7
00:00:26,902 --> 00:00:30,260
Speaker 1: If this is your first time ever listening to Geek Nights, go back.

8
00:00:31,023 --> 00:00:32,000
Speaker 1: Listen to something else.

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,458
Speaker 1: Anything else but this.

10
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:40,720
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is a special, meaning it's in the unscheduled category in addition to the podcast category.

11
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,896
Speaker 1: Meaning it's also crap.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is not Geek Nights.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:52,120
Speaker 0: This is whenever we screw up or don't have an episode or whenever something crazy happens and we have to do an extra episode, it'll be a special.

14
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:53,579
Speaker 1: Which means it's half-assed.

15
00:00:54,042 --> 00:00:58,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only is it half-assed, but I'm using hardware that's barely functioning.

16
00:00:59,226 --> 00:00:59,540
Speaker 1: Awesome.

17
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,020
Speaker 0: Which I'll talk about on Monday in great detail.

18
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,279
Speaker 1: Alright, enough of that.

19
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:14,020
Speaker 1: So, for our little special to make up for no episode, we're gonna tell you a little, well, story slash, I don't know, rant, kind of?

20
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,000
Speaker 0: Yeah, kind of a little bit of- Informative action?

21
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:17,620
Speaker 0: Something.

22
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,338
Speaker 1: Alright, so, if any of you watch Seinfeld, you might have known the joke about Jerry's no-vomit streak.

23
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:27,660
Speaker 0: Yep, it was destroyed, I believe, by a black and white cookie.

24
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:34,380
Speaker 1: Yes, and he hadn't vomited for a very long period of time, many years, and then he ate a black and white cookie and vomited.

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:41,239
Speaker 1: Well, me, Scott, has a similar vomit streak, where I haven't vomited in years and years and years and years.

26
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:41,521
Speaker 1: Now,

27
00:01:41,561 --> 00:01:58,700
Speaker 0: contrast this to about six months ago when Scott had to deal, well, he's in his room and I have the master bedroom, which is on the other side of the, it takes up the whole half of the house, and then there's a hallway, and then the other half of the house is Scott's room, his walk-in closet, and the walk-in closet is directly adjacent to the upstairs bathroom.

28
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:02,640
Speaker 0: So he heard me, and I had food poisoning, horrible food poisoning.

29
00:02:02,824 --> 00:02:03,360
Speaker 1: Or something.

30
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:04,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was food poisoning.

31
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:05,360
Speaker 0: It was bad.

32
00:02:05,521 --> 00:02:06,480
Speaker 0: I'm reasonably certain.

33
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:13,012
Speaker 0: And basically every 10 minutes for most of that night, I bargled, vomited violently and loudly.

34
00:02:13,901 --> 00:02:14,960
Speaker 1: It was so loud.

35
00:02:15,861 --> 00:02:17,259
Speaker 1: God, it was so loud.

36
00:02:19,864 --> 00:02:22,479
Speaker 1: Now, it had happened so many times, he just kept waking my ass up.

37
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:22,726
Speaker 0: Oh!

38
00:02:23,802 --> 00:02:23,844
Speaker 0: Oh!

39
00:02:24,774 --> 00:02:24,838
Speaker 0: Ugh!

40
00:02:26,065 --> 00:02:26,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

41
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,850
Speaker 0: Followed by the ritual of, you know, rinse mouth out, flush toilet, wash teeth, go to bed.

42
00:02:30,241 --> 00:02:34,240
Speaker 1: Now, I hadn't vomited in years, until Friday.

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,140
Speaker 0: Now, he'd come close, but he didn't, actually.

44
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,120
Speaker 0: I remember one time he got really sick with some other, the opposite vomit.

45
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,679
Speaker 1: Yeah, see, I really don't get sick.

46
00:02:43,101 --> 00:02:50,280
Speaker 1: The only thing that ever happens to me, is sometimes I'll eat bad food, or sometimes I'll eat the wrong mix of foods, or sometimes I'll eat too much food.

47
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,679
Speaker 1: And then my stomach will go, "What did you do?

48
00:02:53,603 --> 00:02:54,137
Speaker 1: What did you do?

49
00:02:55,363 --> 00:02:56,096
Speaker 1: Why did you do

50
00:02:56,116 --> 00:02:56,259
Speaker 1: that?".

51
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:57,500
Speaker 0: You tried to do too much with it.

52
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,560
Speaker 1: You tried to do too much.

53
00:02:59,361 --> 00:03:00,940
Speaker 1: Now I will make you very unpleasant.

54
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,660
Speaker 1: And then after like a day or two, I'm back to normal.

55
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:05,720
Speaker 1: But that's the only real illness I ever get.

56
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:12,900
Speaker 0: So this weekend, we had almost all of the core front row crew over for a crazy board gaming weekend.

57
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:17,759
Speaker 0: In fact, we're going to spend all of Tuesday covering, in order, all the games we played this weekend.

58
00:03:18,146 --> 00:03:18,420
Speaker 1: Awesome.

59
00:03:19,141 --> 00:03:26,720
Speaker 0: And it was the core group, except for Katsu, he was busy or something, but he was the only one who wasn't here, of the like chorus, chorus, original front row crew.

60
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,820
Speaker 0: There are a lot more people in the front row crew, but that was like the original.

61
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:30,287
Speaker 1: Yep.

62
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,000
Speaker 0: And we played a million board games, and we'd had to, Pete, his Amtrak was late.

63
00:03:36,322 --> 00:03:37,400
Speaker 0: We never would have seen that coming.

64
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:37,782
Speaker 0: No.

65
00:03:38,621 --> 00:03:39,680
Speaker 1: That is a big surprise.

66
00:03:40,122 --> 00:03:45,357
Speaker 0: So we had to drive, he missed his connecting train to Beacon, so we had to drive up to Poughkeepsie to pick his ass up.

67
00:03:46,561 --> 00:03:50,739
Speaker 0: And we were real hungry, and there weren't so many restaurants up there that we wanted to eat at.

68
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,700
Speaker 0: Well, many that Scott wanted to eat at.

69
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,640
Speaker 1: But you were, the only places you picked are places you knew I don't like.

70
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:55,940
Speaker 1: What?

71
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,740
Speaker 1: Like, hey, let's go to the fish place.

72
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,819
Speaker 1: Hey, let's go to the nasty ass Uno Pizzeria.

73
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:01,379
Speaker 0: Name another place up there.

74
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:02,960
Speaker 1: That's my point.

75
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:03,477
Speaker 0: Yeah.

76
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,400
Speaker 0: So eventually we pass a coyote grill, which we decide, all right, let's go there.

77
00:04:07,503 --> 00:04:08,100
Speaker 0: Coyote.

78
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's coyote to all you Easterners here.

79
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,319
Speaker 0: That's right.

80
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:12,204
Speaker 0: It's coyote.

81
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:14,459
Speaker 0: to people in the West who actually know what the hell that dog is.

82
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:15,420
Speaker 1: No, it's a coyote.

83
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,119
Speaker 1: It's a coyote.

84
00:04:16,201 --> 00:04:17,040
Speaker 1: Like Wile E. Coyote.

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,959
Speaker 1: It's not Wile.

86
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:18,877
Speaker 1: Coyote.

87
00:04:19,362 --> 00:04:19,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

88
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,060
Speaker 0: People mispronounce a lot of words.

89
00:04:21,283 --> 00:04:22,720
Speaker 1: It's not Wile O. Coyote.

90
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,080
Speaker 1: It's Wile E. Coyote.

91
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,380
Speaker 0: Now, while the team is called the Celtics, the word is Celtic.

92
00:04:28,386 --> 00:04:28,598
Speaker 1: Yes.

93
00:04:29,307 --> 00:04:29,880
Speaker 1: That is correct.

94
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,760
Speaker 0: It's the same thing.

95
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,068
Speaker 0: The word...

96
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,760
Speaker 1: But the basketball team is the Celtics.

97
00:04:33,065 --> 00:04:33,155
Speaker 1: Yeah.

98
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,460
Speaker 1: If you try to say Boston Celtics, I'll kick your ass.

99
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,218
Speaker 0: Though I will say...

100
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:37,879
Speaker 1: Probably not, because I don't care that much, but...

101
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:43,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but even then, when I hear someone say Celtics, it's still a great sound to me, because I know it's a mispronunciation, even though it's accepted.

102
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,060
Speaker 0: Kind of like Garymandering versus gerrymandering, but that's a whole other show.

103
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:48,898
Speaker 1: Anyway, we go to the place.

104
00:04:49,662 --> 00:04:50,519
Speaker 0: The place was good food.

105
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,580
Speaker 0: It was real good food.

106
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:52,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was pretty good food.

107
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:57,200
Speaker 1: It was sort of a fancy hip place, like something you'll see in a spy movie or something.

108
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:00,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, like take stuff on the walls and upgrade it like two categories.

109
00:05:00,621 --> 00:05:02,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was still a chain of some sort.

110
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,140
Speaker 1: But it's one of those chains that there aren't so many of them.

111
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,080
Speaker 1: Kind of like Smoky Bones.

112
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:13,678
Speaker 0: But the food was a weird combination of Asian food and Western food and just a whole... Italian food.

113
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:19,360
Speaker 1: It was Mexican, Asian, Italian, and American food all mixed up.

114
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:23,898
Speaker 0: And a lot of them, like dishes, were two different kinds of food mixed together, and it was all really good.

115
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,432
Speaker 1: Yep.

116
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,371
Speaker 0: And Scott got...

117
00:05:26,244 --> 00:05:28,400
Speaker 1: I got this barbecue chicken sandwich that was really good.

118
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:32,000
Speaker 0: Now you ate the second half of it for dinner today, and it didn't make you bargo.

119
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:32,819
Speaker 1: No, it didn't.

120
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:33,280
Speaker 1: Yes.

121
00:05:35,965 --> 00:05:36,839
Speaker 0: I'm really not feeling...

122
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:37,600
Speaker 1: I think... All right.

123
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:43,700
Speaker 1: So around Thursday, like I didn't... Thursday I went to the city, and I didn't really eat much on Thursday.

124
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:48,359
Speaker 1: I ate like a bagel, and then I got home and ate dinner, and that was it.

125
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:48,937
Speaker 0: Yep.

126
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:50,439
Speaker 0: Friday you didn't eat so much either.

127
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,440
Speaker 1: Friday I didn't eat too much until we went to this grill.

128
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:59,200
Speaker 1: So I had gone two days without eating, but for some reason I didn't feel real hungry.

129
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,539
Speaker 1: Like my body didn't say eat a lot of food.

130
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:07,720
Speaker 1: But I knew I hadn't eaten, but my stomach didn't say fill me up, but I ate anyway.

131
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,296
Speaker 1: And I think that's... There was something going on before.

132
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,960
Speaker 1: I got... I don't think it was the food from that grill.

133
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:17,580
Speaker 1: I think it just happened to be that's where I ate, and there was something wrong beforehand.

134
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:18,777
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was.

135
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:34,495
Speaker 0: Sorry to interrupt, but while we're recording the show right now, the Geek Night special, and I just got messaged by someone, one of our listeners, Brian, the person who won the design contest, bugging us about the fact that we didn't upload the Geek Night special yet.

136
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,360
Speaker 1: Okay, Lowell.

137
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:35,787
Speaker 0: Yeah.

138
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:50,420
Speaker 1: So anyway, we ate at this place after two days of me not eating and not feeling very hungry, and then that night I wasn't feeling 100%, but I didn't feel too bad, went to bed, and I don't know, when did we go to bed that night?

139
00:06:50,702 --> 00:06:51,798
Speaker 0: Oh God, it was like two.

140
00:06:52,923 --> 00:06:53,979
Speaker 1: No, because I woke up at two.

141
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:55,300
Speaker 0: No, no, we went to bed early.

142
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,740
Speaker 0: We stayed up late Saturday.

143
00:06:57,023 --> 00:06:57,216
Speaker 1: Right.

144
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, we went to bed early, like midnight.

145
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:03,179
Speaker 1: All right, so around two hours later at two, I woke up with a mad stomach pain.

146
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:08,599
Speaker 1: So I went to the bathroom and I had me some wet, wet number two.

147
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:09,740
Speaker 1: Great.

148
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was bad.

149
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,319
Speaker 0: Now, I remember the last time that happened to you.

150
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,180
Speaker 0: Didn't you cure it by laying naked on the bathroom floor?

151
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,159
Speaker 1: That is correct.

152
00:07:16,682 --> 00:07:19,600
Speaker 1: The last time I cured my stomach illness.

153
00:07:20,201 --> 00:07:23,220
Speaker 0: I thank the demon lord that I didn't stumble in upon that.

154
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:23,680
Speaker 1: Yes.

155
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:25,680
Speaker 1: I think we talked about this on an early episode.

156
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:26,398
Speaker 0: I think we did.

157
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:27,260
Speaker 1: Anyway.

158
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:34,660
Speaker 0: So if you want to hear the story of Scott lying naked on the bathroom floor after diarrhea-ing for quite some time, search through the archives.

159
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,100
Speaker 1: Yes.

160
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,580
Speaker 1: Now, here's another story about Scott sitting naked on the bathroom floor.

161
00:07:39,788 --> 00:07:39,934
Speaker 1: Wow.

162
00:07:41,082 --> 00:07:41,940
Speaker 1: I had a diarrhea.

163
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:44,239
Speaker 0: Do I need to add a category for this?

164
00:07:44,607 --> 00:07:44,755
Speaker 1: No.

165
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:48,140
Speaker 0: Scott naked on the bathroom floor, episode four.

166
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:53,000
Speaker 1: And then after I was done, it was still pretty painful, like worse than the last time.

167
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,119
Speaker 1: So I'm like, you know what, I'll try that again.

168
00:07:55,441 --> 00:07:56,200
Speaker 1: It worked the last time.

169
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,740
Speaker 1: And I was sweating balls.

170
00:07:58,724 --> 00:07:59,259
Speaker 1: God damn.

171
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:11,920
Speaker 0: Now, to elucidate that point, now on Thursday at my work, I saw the forecast for the weekend and it said that it was going to rain nonstop.

172
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,600
Speaker 0: The percentage chance of rain was 100.

173
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:19,080
Speaker 0: Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday to the following Thursday.

174
00:08:19,861 --> 00:08:24,280
Speaker 0: It predicted up to eight inches of rain in Beacon over two days.

175
00:08:24,645 --> 00:08:25,520
Speaker 0: That is insane.

176
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,700
Speaker 0: Now the actual reality is that it didn't rain at all.

177
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,659
Speaker 1: It rained a bit today.

178
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:32,078
Speaker 0: It rained a tiny bit.

179
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,059
Speaker 1: Not as much as it could have and should have.

180
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,977
Speaker 0: Instead, there has been this constant haze as clouds descended upon us and it didn't rain.

181
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:49,317
Speaker 0: The humidity was 100 billion percent and it's like 80 degrees, my air conditioner could barely keep up, I'm running the air conditioner super cold just to keep the humidity out of my room.

182
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:49,880
Speaker 1: Yep.

183
00:08:50,781 --> 00:08:53,000
Speaker 0: In fact, you might hear the audio sound a little odd.

184
00:08:53,322 --> 00:08:56,817
Speaker 0: That's because the air conditioning in the fan is going full blast in the background of the studio.

185
00:08:57,183 --> 00:08:58,179
Speaker 1: And we're not turning it off.

186
00:08:59,961 --> 00:09:03,740
Speaker 1: So, I had a diarrhea and I was still in a lot of pain, unlike usually it's a relief.

187
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:05,400
Speaker 1: It wasn't so much of a relief.

188
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,718
Speaker 1: Some feverish.

189
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:10,340
Speaker 0: Now, at what point did you think, wait a minute, is the streak over?

190
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:14,960
Speaker 1: You know what, every time this happens, I think it might be the end of the streak.

191
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:20,179
Speaker 1: You know, it's like I wake up in the middle of the night with pain and I say, I hope this isn't the end of the streak is the first thing I think.

192
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:21,639
Speaker 1: I'm perfect.

193
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,679
Speaker 1: That's completely honest.

194
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,979
Speaker 1: That's the first thing I think is, ah, this might be the end.

195
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,098
Speaker 1: Please let it not be the end.

196
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,498
Speaker 0: So you contrast this with me.

197
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:38,820
Speaker 0: Now, when I do get sick, which honestly, once I left Rochester and college and started getting sleep and eating properly, I almost never get sick anymore.

198
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:42,797
Speaker 1: Well, you did get sick that night when you were just vomiting 20 times.

199
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:43,935
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

200
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:49,375
Speaker 0: But I mean, compared to when I was in college, I get sick maybe two or three times a year at most now.

201
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:50,899
Speaker 1: I have very good health.

202
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:56,170
Speaker 1: Since around, ever since I had the pneumonia, I think I was in middle school for like a week.

203
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:59,460
Speaker 1: My rate of sickness has really not changed at all.

204
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:03,320
Speaker 1: It's like once every few months, stomach problem for a night.

205
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:03,897
Speaker 1: The end.

206
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:04,480
Speaker 1: That's it.

207
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:07,180
Speaker 1: That's the only sickness I've had for years and years and years and years and years.

208
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,580
Speaker 0: But when I do get sick, my body for some reason is on a vomit hair trigger.

209
00:10:13,566 --> 00:10:14,320
Speaker 0: It's like my body.

210
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,140
Speaker 1: You have built in Ipikat gland.

211
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:16,776
Speaker 0: You know what?

212
00:10:17,162 --> 00:10:20,860
Speaker 0: If all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like vomit.

213
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:24,500
Speaker 0: So if I get sick, I just vomit.

214
00:10:25,444 --> 00:10:26,680
Speaker 0: If my stomach is, I just vomit.

215
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:34,240
Speaker 0: In fact, I think I told the story of when I got food poisoning in New York City and I vomited so much I'd go to the hospital and I might have died.

216
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:34,725
Speaker 1: Wow.

217
00:10:35,045 --> 00:10:35,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's right.

218
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:35,911
Speaker 1: Yeah.

219
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:43,840
Speaker 1: So I'm laying on the floor in pain and the cold floor actually kind of helped even though I was completely covered in sweat.

220
00:10:43,941 --> 00:10:46,819
Speaker 1: I mean, it was as if I had been in a sweat swimming pool.

221
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:50,638
Speaker 1: Like it was dripping out of my hair like a faucet.

222
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,200
Speaker 1: It was crazy.

223
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:56,660
Speaker 1: I was all feverish with stomach pains, lying on the bathroom floor.

224
00:10:57,661 --> 00:10:57,894
Speaker 1: You know?

225
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:04,340
Speaker 1: This is about the only part of me that wasn't nasty was my ass because I just wiped it after having calorie.

226
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wanted to know about that.

227
00:11:05,702 --> 00:11:05,860
Speaker 0: Yeah.

228
00:11:06,864 --> 00:11:09,240
Speaker 0: If you want to continue with that, I can go into great detail.

229
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:12,020
Speaker 0: Every time I vomited when I had food poisoning.

230
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:16,455
Speaker 0: The difference as time went on in what was coming out of me.

231
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:21,740
Speaker 0: because just when you think there's nothing left in my body, there's absolutely nothing that can come out.

232
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,139
Speaker 0: Something new would come out.

233
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,580
Speaker 0: Something new and frightening.

234
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,200
Speaker 0: A new frontier of vomit.

235
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:29,439
Speaker 1: So it didn't really feel nauseous, like whoa, dizzy, nauseous.

236
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:33,580
Speaker 1: And I didn't really feel anything except the pain in the stomach.

237
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:38,840
Speaker 1: And then I finally decided, yeah, you know, I'll go up to the toilet there.

238
00:11:39,622 --> 00:11:41,940
Speaker 1: It didn't really feel like I had to vomit that bad.

239
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,740
Speaker 0: No, I've done that before.

240
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:44,719
Speaker 1: Not any more than any other time I was sick.

241
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,700
Speaker 0: You know, when you get over the toilet, like if it's going to come, I want to be ready.

242
00:11:47,823 --> 00:11:48,398
Speaker 0: And then you see.

243
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,140
Speaker 0: And then if it doesn't happen, you go back to bed.

244
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:50,819
Speaker 0: That kind of thing.

245
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:51,520
Speaker 1: Yeah.

246
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:56,780
Speaker 1: It's like I didn't, you know, other times that I had the stomach sickness, it's like vomiting was there as an option.

247
00:11:56,900 --> 00:12:00,759
Speaker 1: Like if I tried a little bit, I could have vomited easily, but I held back for the sake of the streak.

248
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:01,232
Speaker 0: Wow.

249
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:04,040
Speaker 0: If my body wants me to vomit, I figure it knows what it's doing.

250
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,220
Speaker 1: Well, it didn't want to vomit super bad.

251
00:12:06,320 --> 00:12:08,259
Speaker 1: It only said you can vomit if you want to.

252
00:12:08,621 --> 00:12:10,799
Speaker 1: It wasn't like a super strong bardole.

253
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:16,400
Speaker 0: In fact, one time I've made myself vomit prematurely to prevent future problems.

254
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:16,808
Speaker 1: Yep.

255
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,160
Speaker 0: That was when we got that orange juice that went bad.

256
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:19,447
Speaker 1: Yep.

257
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:19,989
Speaker 0: Yeah.

258
00:12:20,725 --> 00:12:21,700
Speaker 0: I'll talk about that someday.

259
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:22,008
Speaker 1: Okay.

260
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,719
Speaker 1: So I get up to the toilet and I'm like, all right, yeah.

261
00:12:26,386 --> 00:12:27,078
Speaker 1: And I bargled.

262
00:12:27,684 --> 00:12:28,500
Speaker 1: Oh, then I bargled.

263
00:12:28,722 --> 00:12:28,958
Speaker 1: I can't.

264
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:29,899
Speaker 1: It was so bad.

265
00:12:30,381 --> 00:12:34,540
Speaker 1: Well, it's kind of weird because it wasn't, I haven't bargled in a long time, you see.

266
00:12:34,781 --> 00:12:38,640
Speaker 1: So I didn't quite remember a hundred percent the feeling of vomiting.

267
00:12:39,082 --> 00:12:44,800
Speaker 0: You know, it always feels really good after you're done and your body says, your body says, all right, you did me good.

268
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:45,959
Speaker 1: It sure does.

269
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:46,839
Speaker 0: That'll do pig.

270
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:52,040
Speaker 1: But, uh, you know, what came out was pretty much that sandwich I ate for dinner and it was happy.

271
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:58,459
Speaker 1: You can see, you can see like, okay, there's some bread, there's some onion, there's some chicken, there's some barbecue sauce.

272
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:10,659
Speaker 0: Now see, the only times I've ever vomited like that where undigested food came back was when I had done something wrong, like not slept in several days or not eaten for two days and then eaten.

273
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:25,220
Speaker 1: The only time I remember vomiting where what came up was like not just, didn't look like the fake puke you buy at the store was when I drank too much grape juice and I barfed up purple shit out my nose and my everything.

274
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:27,359
Speaker 0: One time I had the flu.

275
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:34,760
Speaker 0: I was a little kid and my little brother, all I remember is that he ran out of the room screaming.

276
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:37,000
Speaker 0: Now I was really sick.

277
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,320
Speaker 0: I had the flu and I was staying home from school and we had a vomit bucket.

278
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:57,160
Speaker 0: It was this old popcorn bowl that we used whenever a kid was sick in the house or whenever the parent, whenever someone was sick and it laid next to the couch and I was laying there watching like mask or something on TV on a tape and I had eaten a whole bunch of green jello and I hadn't vomited yet.

279
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:58,679
Speaker 0: So we didn't think this was a vomiting flu.

280
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:01,860
Speaker 0: It was just a flu flu and there was no warning.

281
00:14:02,202 --> 00:14:03,060
Speaker 0: There was no nothing.

282
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:03,820
Speaker 0: I was sitting there.

283
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,839
Speaker 1: So you should have made jello.

284
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:05,569
Speaker 1: God damn it.

285
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,559
Speaker 1: You should have made a jello.

286
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:08,620
Speaker 0: Hey, at least you had the lassi.

287
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:09,840
Speaker 1: The what?

288
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:10,339
Speaker 0: The lassi.

289
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:11,119
Speaker 1: Lassi.

290
00:14:11,302 --> 00:14:11,390
Speaker 1: Yeah.

291
00:14:11,681 --> 00:14:12,299
Speaker 1: I was like lassi.

292
00:14:12,542 --> 00:14:12,999
Speaker 1: That's a dog.

293
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:32,470
Speaker 0: But I was sitting there and suddenly I just felt this horrible urge and I turned and a force and it filled the bucket and overflowed and

294
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,692
Speaker 1: my little brother had to have

295
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:47,000
Speaker 0: been like four or five and he ran out of the room screaming and my mom runs in like, what?

296
00:14:47,502 --> 00:14:47,899
Speaker 0: What is busy?

297
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:48,257
Speaker 0: Dead.

298
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,815
Speaker 0: What's going on?

299
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,679
Speaker 0: I'm just, there's a pile of vomit.

300
00:14:51,264 --> 00:14:51,858
Speaker 0: Just green.

301
00:14:52,742 --> 00:14:53,118
Speaker 1: All right.

302
00:14:53,301 --> 00:14:57,300
Speaker 1: So, you know, I vomited, you know, a couple of times.

303
00:14:57,460 --> 00:15:00,220
Speaker 1: It wasn't, you know, I guess you could lump them all into one vomit.

304
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,419
Speaker 1: It was like vomit, stop, vomit, stop, vomit, stop.

305
00:15:03,521 --> 00:15:03,917
Speaker 1: Vomit, stop.

306
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:04,374
Speaker 1: The end.

307
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,195
Speaker 1: And that was it.

308
00:15:05,661 --> 00:15:06,440
Speaker 1: Didn't vomit anymore.

309
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:08,560
Speaker 1: Then I took a shower immediately.

310
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,016
Speaker 0: Yeah.

311
00:15:09,102 --> 00:15:09,739
Speaker 0: I always do that.

312
00:15:10,641 --> 00:15:14,158
Speaker 1: And while I was in the shower, I felt some vomit still at the back of my throat and in my nose.

313
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:17,238
Speaker 1: So I kind of blew my nose and like a piece of chicken came out.

314
00:15:18,981 --> 00:15:21,538
Speaker 1: It was a piece of chicken sitting in the drain of the shower and I was looking at it.

315
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,480
Speaker 1: I was feverish, slightly delusional.

316
00:15:28,941 --> 00:15:35,279
Speaker 1: I'm feverish, slightly delusional in a slightly cold shower looking down at the drain at this piece of chicken.

317
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,619
Speaker 1: And I stood there for a few minutes.

318
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:37,456
Speaker 0: Yeah.

319
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,399
Speaker 0: I know that delusion state where you just don't know what's going on.

320
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,800
Speaker 1: It wasn't like LSD delusional, but it was fever delusional.

321
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:50,280
Speaker 1: So after I decided I was no longer covered in sweat, I dried off.

322
00:15:50,766 --> 00:15:51,498
Speaker 1: It's nice and cool.

323
00:15:53,223 --> 00:15:55,360
Speaker 1: Went back to bed, still had a little grumpiness.

324
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:58,617
Speaker 1: I got up a few hours later for just a little bit of diarrhea, but that was it.

325
00:15:59,805 --> 00:15:59,880
Speaker 0: Yep.

326
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:00,090
Speaker 1: No.

327
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,820
Speaker 1: And I haven't had a bowel movement since Friday night and it's Sunday.

328
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:04,778
Speaker 1: Yay Petal Bismol.

329
00:16:06,363 --> 00:16:07,379
Speaker 0: Have you been still taking that?

330
00:16:07,802 --> 00:16:08,599
Speaker 1: No, I took it once.

331
00:16:10,804 --> 00:16:11,900
Speaker 1: And I barely ate anything.

332
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,220
Speaker 1: Remember?

333
00:16:12,562 --> 00:16:13,420
Speaker 1: What did I eat since then?

334
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,679
Speaker 0: I ate- Well, we went to the Indian place for dinner and all you ate was like one piece of bread.

335
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,120
Speaker 1: No, I ate like three pieces of bread and a mango lassi.

336
00:16:19,644 --> 00:16:19,800
Speaker 0: Yeah.

337
00:16:19,881 --> 00:16:20,940
Speaker 0: It was real thin bread though.

338
00:16:21,061 --> 00:16:24,899
Speaker 1: And I had a muffin and some toast and French toast.

339
00:16:25,846 --> 00:16:26,338
Speaker 1: Lots of bread.

340
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,260
Speaker 0: Of course, then today we had the food.

341
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:31,080
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

342
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:33,159
Speaker 1: I ate the other half of the sandwich that I bargled up.

343
00:16:33,460 --> 00:16:36,620
Speaker 0: So we'll see if you bargle tonight because- I really don't think I'm going to bargle.

344
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,378
Speaker 1: I think I'm good now.

345
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:37,867
Speaker 0: Yeah.

346
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:38,820
Speaker 0: I don't think it was the sandwich.

347
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:49,420
Speaker 1: I think tomorrow, like this very- You know, I don't think it was the- There wasn't anything in the sandwich that was like poisonous or toxic or anything like that.

348
00:16:50,205 --> 00:16:52,559
Speaker 1: If I had eaten anything, it would have done it.

349
00:16:53,261 --> 00:16:58,890
Speaker 1: If I could have eaten a steak or a hamburger at a different restaurant, I would have barfed that up.

350
00:16:59,400 --> 00:16:59,578
Speaker 1: You know?

351
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:09,199
Speaker 1: It was the fact that how much I ate and the timing of the eating that did it, I think it was very much a condition from before that caused it.

352
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:23,000
Speaker 0: Now I like how when any one of us woke up because I was asleep in my giant bed and Pete was asleep on the giant futon and Alex was asleep on my giant uncomfortable chair because my room was very large and the door was shut and locked and the air conditioning was on.

353
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,259
Speaker 0: So we had no idea this happened.

354
00:17:25,092 --> 00:17:25,220
Speaker 1: Nope.

355
00:17:25,801 --> 00:17:28,700
Speaker 1: The first time- If I didn't say anything, they would have thought the streak was alive.

356
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:31,919
Speaker 1: The first time he sees any of us- I could have lied about it and kept on.

357
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,000
Speaker 1: So if anyone questions my honesty again, they can shove it.

358
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,660
Speaker 0: The first thing he says to me when I wake up is, "Rim, the streak is over.

359
00:17:38,881 --> 00:17:39,379
Speaker 0: I bargled.

360
00:17:39,601 --> 00:17:40,268
Speaker 0: I bargled all

361
00:17:40,389 --> 00:17:40,732
Speaker 0: night.".

362
00:17:41,563 --> 00:17:41,934
Speaker 0: And I was like,

363
00:17:41,955 --> 00:17:42,037
Speaker 0: "What?".

364
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:42,840
Speaker 1: It wasn't all night.

365
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,460
Speaker 1: That's not what I said.

366
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,340
Speaker 0: You said something like that.

367
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,195
Speaker 0: You were like, "I bargled last

368
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:45,440
Speaker 0: night.".

369
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,052
Speaker 1: That's what I said.

370
00:17:46,661 --> 00:17:55,955
Speaker 0: And I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick and I was sick
