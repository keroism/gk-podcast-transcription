1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,560
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday, September 10th, 2014.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:10,861
Speaker 0: I'm Rip.

3
00:00:13,014 --> 00:00:13,386
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,976
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,037 --> 00:00:17,469
Speaker 0: Tonight, the J-drama, Blue Blazes.

6
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:24,199
Speaker 0: [laughter] Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,920
Speaker 0: In other news, I think Scott is dying of the tubercules.

8
00:00:32,528 --> 00:00:34,818
Speaker 0: I just had- There's some tuberculin going on here.

9
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:45,060
Speaker 1: At the PAX, it wasn't PAX Pox, but I had a scratchy throat, which I think was from a combination of talking too much, yelling in loud places, and also eating too much pie.

10
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:48,640
Speaker 0: How could the pie cause the scratchy throat, Scott?

11
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,279
Speaker 1: Because then there was too much stomach acid, and while I was sleeping, the acid scratched my throat.

12
00:00:52,740 --> 00:00:55,099
Speaker 0: Oh, so you're saying you had a for-real gastric reflux?

13
00:00:55,981 --> 00:00:58,450
Speaker 1: Well, I didn't feel it anywhere in my esophagus, so I don't know.

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:00:58,980
Speaker 1: I'm just guessing.

15
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:05,600
Speaker 0: I do recall when we went to bed that night, you were laying there making noises that sounded like you were dying.

16
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:11,239
Speaker 1: You were just laying there like- I ate too much pie, and bad things came out the other end.

17
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,567
Speaker 0: But pie, man.

18
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:14,140
Speaker 0: How can you have so much trouble with pie?

19
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,280
Speaker 1: The problem wasn't the fact that it was pie.

20
00:01:18,441 --> 00:01:21,620
Speaker 1: It's that I ate when I was full, because the pie was so delicious.

21
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:30,980
Speaker 1: Anyway, so that scratchy throat turned into mucus, which went to my nose, and then my throat, and then my nose, and then my throat.

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:34,324
Speaker 1: And right now, it's just mucus in the throat that my body is- Oh, Captain Mucus.

23
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:34,709
Speaker 0: What?

24
00:01:34,891 --> 00:01:35,599
Speaker 0: You're full of mucus.

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,640
Speaker 1: I haven't felt actually sick at all during this whole period.

26
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,907
Speaker 1: I felt perfectly fine.

27
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,239
Speaker 1: I'm just full of fucking mucus, and I keep coughing and/or sneezing it out.

28
00:01:44,661 --> 00:01:45,600
Speaker 1: At least you were- It keeps coming.

29
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,940
Speaker 0: At least it's telling that you're- And it's not green.

30
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,479
Speaker 1: It's not some nasty infection shit.

31
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:53,479
Speaker 0: Your character- I mean, your coughs sound kind of wet, so it almost sounds like an upper respiratory thing.

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,675
Speaker 1: But- But yeah, it's just mucus.

33
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:56,280
Speaker 1: Won't stop coming.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:01,859
Speaker 0: I guess it's fitting that your character in a Bernie Wheel game failed his health test against the cold, because we're basically hiking through the Arctic.

35
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:02,785
Speaker 1: Yep.

36
00:02:03,469 --> 00:02:05,400
Speaker 1: I was able to roleplay with reality.

37
00:02:06,687 --> 00:02:06,767
Speaker 0: Ah.

38
00:02:06,909 --> 00:02:16,960
Speaker 0: So, some funny meta news, 'cause we were last night playing Bernie Wheel, and not to let me tell you about my character, but we're- Let him tell you about his character.

39
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:21,094
Speaker 0: We're a group of cultist assholes nominally researching stuff, and we're going off into the Arctic.

40
00:02:21,114 --> 00:02:21,440
Speaker 1: It's the society.

41
00:02:22,021 --> 00:02:22,691
Speaker 0: Yes, cultists.

42
00:02:22,955 --> 00:02:23,320
Speaker 0: Society.

43
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,871
Speaker 0: The society of cultists.

44
00:02:25,355 --> 00:02:25,960
Speaker 1: Secret society.

45
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,809
Speaker 0: So, we're going off into the Arctic, HMS Terror and Erebus- It's Greenland.

46
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:30,539
Speaker 1: It's not the Arctic.

47
00:02:31,281 --> 00:02:37,240
Speaker 0: We're going off into an icebound wilderness to find a buried city and awaken some god that'll probably kill us.

48
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:37,898
Speaker 0: It's gonna be awesome.

49
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:38,978
Speaker 1: That is awesome and true.

50
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:39,581
Speaker 0: Yeah.

51
00:02:40,084 --> 00:02:43,960
Speaker 0: And, uh, the fact that your character, you know, failed his health test was funny.

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:52,639
Speaker 0: But, uh, so we're playing that game, and we're constantly referencing the disappearance of the Franklin Expedition, because- I mentioned it once.

53
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,999
Speaker 0: I mentioned it or referenced it a couple times.

54
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:56,139
Speaker 1: I didn't get those references.

55
00:02:56,381 --> 00:02:57,800
Speaker 0: Oh, you never read that book, The Terror.

56
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,698
Speaker 1: I'm not going to.

57
00:02:58,981 --> 00:02:59,246
Speaker 0: You should.

58
00:02:59,266 --> 00:03:00,020
Speaker 0: I'll make it a booklet book.

59
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:00,587
Speaker 0: I'll read it again.

60
00:03:00,608 --> 00:03:01,560
Speaker 0: That book is fucking awesome.

61
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,199
Speaker 0: Go fuck yourself.

62
00:03:02,844 --> 00:03:18,340
Speaker 0: The only problem with that book, and I will admit this is a problem, is that it has gruesome, 100% accurate, really up close and personal depictions of lead poisoning and scurvy.

63
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:21,400
Speaker 0: And let me tell you, scurvy is a horrifying thing.

64
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:23,080
Speaker 1: I don't want to read about those things.

65
00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:24,239
Speaker 1: I might just vomit on the book.

66
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,320
Speaker 0: The worst part is that if you read the book, uh, I didn't know it was based on a true story.

67
00:03:29,844 --> 00:03:35,340
Speaker 0: So I'm reading it, and I'm enjoying it, and at one point, like, I read this letter that, like, someone left behind.

68
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:46,419
Speaker 0: Then I found out later that that letter was actually found in the real world and that the novel was based on, like, what they found of the missing expedition, and all those people were real, and yeah.

69
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:54,340
Speaker 0: So, funnily enough, turns out there was an announcement pretty much, like, yesterday that they actually just found one of the ships.

70
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:55,780
Speaker 1: Okay.

71
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:56,378
Speaker 0: Like, for real.

72
00:03:56,661 --> 00:03:57,159
Speaker 1: Under the ice?

73
00:03:57,341 --> 00:03:57,594
Speaker 0: Yes.

74
00:03:57,963 --> 00:03:58,267
Speaker 0: In the water.

75
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:09,998
Speaker 0: They found it because Global Warming has basically opened up the Northwest Passage, and Canada sent a ship up there to basically claim the Arctic and do all their bullshit, and they just found it straight up.

76
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,180
Speaker 1: Dude, Global Warming is awesome.

77
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:17,279
Speaker 1: We should get a ship and go find pirate ships that are basically bubbling up from the melted ice.

78
00:04:17,421 --> 00:04:20,779
Speaker 0: I don't think many pirates tried to find the Northwest Passage.

79
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,940
Speaker 1: Vikings are pirates, kind of.

80
00:04:23,201 --> 00:04:25,280
Speaker 0: I don't think Vikings went that way on purpose.

81
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:26,920
Speaker 1: Woolly mammoth fossils.

82
00:04:29,746 --> 00:04:30,940
Speaker 1: All of those things are valuable.

83
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:38,720
Speaker 0: Also, fun fact, this expedition went up into the Arctic to die, and everybody died of madness and lead poisoning and scurvy.

84
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:39,316
Speaker 1: You don't say.

85
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,380
Speaker 0: The ships were the Erebus and the Terror.

86
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:44,600
Speaker 0: Erebus basically means darkness.

87
00:04:46,307 --> 00:04:56,160
Speaker 0: So, remember that all these men, it was like 200 men, died alone and mad, starving to death and eating each other in the Arctic after being iced in for multiple years.

88
00:04:56,382 --> 00:04:57,333
Speaker 1: So Cthulhu got them.

89
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:08,708
Speaker 0: And before this expedition, someone came to them and said, "Hey, young men, would you like to go off into the Arctic in the Terror and the

90
00:05:08,768 --> 00:05:08,949
Speaker 0: Darkness?".

91
00:05:10,584 --> 00:05:11,359
Speaker 1: How much does it pay?

92
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:12,476
Speaker 0: Not much.

93
00:05:13,324 --> 00:05:14,679
Speaker 1: Is there a Cthulhu on the way?

94
00:05:16,903 --> 00:05:18,900
Speaker 1: Because I'm totally in the society.

95
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,380
Speaker 0: So, anyway, it's Wednesday.

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,580
Speaker 0: I got sort of a geek bite because I'm completely, like, I watch Teen Titans.

97
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,499
Speaker 0: I've already talked about it.

98
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,780
Speaker 0: That show is amazing.

99
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:28,359
Speaker 0: Teen Titans Go!

100
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,169
Speaker 1: The cartoon.

101
00:05:29,189 --> 00:05:29,719
Speaker 1: that's mad old?

102
00:05:30,021 --> 00:05:30,939
Speaker 0: No, Teen Titans Go!

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,639
Speaker 0: Not Teen Titans.

104
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:32,659
Speaker 1: What year is it from?

105
00:05:32,921 --> 00:05:33,717
Speaker 0: The new, like, right now.

106
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:34,920
Speaker 1: Okay.

107
00:05:35,482 --> 00:05:37,779
Speaker 0: I've talked about this on the show, like, four times.

108
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:38,820
Speaker 1: Okay.

109
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,938
Speaker 0: Teen Titans Go!

110
00:05:40,263 --> 00:05:40,659
Speaker 0: It's new.

111
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:41,520
Speaker 0: It's ongoing.

112
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,899
Speaker 0: There's a new episode, like, right now.

113
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:46,199
Speaker 1: I don't like any Titans or teens.

114
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:48,269
Speaker 0: Teen Titans is amazing.

115
00:05:48,892 --> 00:05:50,220
Speaker 0: if you watch Teen Titans Go!

116
00:05:50,642 --> 00:05:52,280
Speaker 0: If you read the comics, they're terrible.

117
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:56,339
Speaker 0: If you watch the old animation or the older animation, they're the worst.

118
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,760
Speaker 0: But, anyway, I've talked about that.

119
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:01,900
Speaker 1: If you want to claim that Teen Titans is good, you must explain Wonder Girl and her history.

120
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:03,260
Speaker 0: Wonder Girl's not in Teen Titans Go!

121
00:06:03,741 --> 00:06:04,580
Speaker 0: So, they explained.

122
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:05,431
Speaker 1: Okay.

123
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,240
Speaker 1: I explained it.

124
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,640
Speaker 1: That makes it already better than regular old Teen Titans.

125
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,250
Speaker 0: Scott, Teen Titans Go!

126
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:17,720
Speaker 0: is basically just Raven, Beast Boy, Cyborg, Robin, and Starfire, and they're all fucked up people.

127
00:06:17,941 --> 00:06:18,820
Speaker 1: Only Cyborg is good.

128
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:19,520
Speaker 1: Everyone else sucks.

129
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:20,800
Speaker 0: Beast Boy is pretty great, actually.

130
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:21,600
Speaker 1: Fuck Beast Boy.

131
00:06:21,661 --> 00:06:23,880
Speaker 0: I think Raven and Beast Boy are tied for my favorites.

132
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:25,273
Speaker 0: Anyway.

133
00:06:26,322 --> 00:06:28,040
Speaker 1: And Cyborg's only cool because he's a cyborg.

134
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,960
Speaker 0: Cyborg's actually really, really goddamn annoying.

135
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:32,619
Speaker 1: Well, you know what?

136
00:06:32,841 --> 00:06:33,299
Speaker 1: He's a cyborg.

137
00:06:33,682 --> 00:06:33,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, he is.

138
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,180
Speaker 1: That makes up pretty much anything.

139
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,679
Speaker 0: So, I'm caught up on that.

140
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,200
Speaker 0: Venture Brothers hasn't come out yet.

141
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,360
Speaker 0: I'm caught up on Adventure Time.

142
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:41,320
Speaker 0: We've talked about that a bunch.

143
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,239
Speaker 0: So, I need a new animation to watch.

144
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,160
Speaker 0: Just a new show to watch, other than Sailor Moon.

145
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:46,039
Speaker 1: I just asked me.

146
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,039
Speaker 1: I could have told you what to watch.

147
00:06:47,361 --> 00:06:54,357
Speaker 0: And it's got to be in English so I can watch it without having to watch subtitles because I'd watch it while I'm mopping and stuff and doing the things that adults do.

148
00:06:55,521 --> 00:06:58,980
Speaker 0: So, I've started watching The Amazing Adventures of Gumball.

149
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:00,473
Speaker 1: Oh, isn't that the...

150
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:04,220
Speaker 0: That's like the cat and the fish guy and the rabbit.

151
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:08,120
Speaker 1: Oh, I thought you were talking about the piratey one.

152
00:07:08,525 --> 00:07:08,635
Speaker 1: What?

153
00:07:09,181 --> 00:07:09,991
Speaker 1: What's the show?

154
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:10,619
Speaker 1: that's piratey?

155
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,153
Speaker 0: Piratey?

156
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,160
Speaker 1: Blabjack something.

157
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:12,600
Speaker 0: Blabjack?

158
00:07:12,702 --> 00:07:13,780
Speaker 0: No, I'm not watching that.

159
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:14,660
Speaker 0: I don't even know what that is.

160
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,259
Speaker 1: I heard that one's actually good and it's piratey.

161
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:16,954
Speaker 0: Might be.

162
00:07:17,461 --> 00:07:19,080
Speaker 0: I'm watching this show.

163
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,659
Speaker 0: I'll show a screenshot of it.

164
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,137
Speaker 0: These guys.

165
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,480
Speaker 1: What the fuck is that?

166
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,659
Speaker 1: I've never seen that in my life.

167
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:23,992
Speaker 1: Really?

168
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:25,159
Speaker 1: Why are you watching this?

169
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,099
Speaker 1: You really haven't seen that?

170
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:27,200
Speaker 1: I've never seen that ever.

171
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,680
Speaker 0: It's like one of Cartoon Network's semi-flagship shows these days.

172
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,299
Speaker 1: I would just rewatch Textures Lab instead of watching whatever that is.

173
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,980
Speaker 0: This is actually pretty good.

174
00:07:36,343 --> 00:07:36,819
Speaker 1: Okay, sure.

175
00:07:37,343 --> 00:07:39,300
Speaker 0: I am actually really enjoying it.

176
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:41,980
Speaker 1: The only thing good about that picture is that the house has googly eyes.

177
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,253
Speaker 1: And there's a fish.

178
00:07:44,761 --> 00:07:45,719
Speaker 1: A fish can't be bad either.

179
00:07:46,141 --> 00:07:47,660
Speaker 0: The fish actually is a pretty good character.

180
00:07:47,761 --> 00:07:50,060
Speaker 1: I don't mind the Mario bushes on the front lawn either.

181
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:50,718
Speaker 1: Those are nice.

182
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:57,920
Speaker 0: The cool thing about the show is that it's basically a combination of 2D animation, 3D animation, stop motion animation, paper cutout animation.

183
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,879
Speaker 1: So basically all the animations at once.

184
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:00,377
Speaker 0: Yes.

185
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:01,619
Speaker 1: That's interesting.

186
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:10,420
Speaker 0: And it's kind of like a modern Simpsons in the sense that it is the story of a family that is incredibly dysfunctional.

187
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,420
Speaker 0: The mother is kind of a bad person.

188
00:08:13,621 --> 00:08:14,959
Speaker 0: The dad is a failure at life.

189
00:08:15,981 --> 00:08:19,300
Speaker 0: And the kids, it kind of focuses on one of the boys.

190
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,440
Speaker 0: So kind of a Bart Simpson.

191
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:27,900
Speaker 0: But cross it with SpongeBob because it's got that sort of humor going on.

192
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,540
Speaker 1: I'm not into that humor.

193
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,120
Speaker 0: You know, it has its place.

194
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,240
Speaker 0: I enjoy it legitimately and I think it's funny.

195
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:35,179
Speaker 0: And I'm going to watch it some more and then I'm going to straight up review it.

196
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:42,280
Speaker 0: So guys, if you need something to watch, it's actually worth checking out at least like a clip on YouTube.

197
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,458
Speaker 1: If you're a rim type person.

198
00:08:43,855 --> 00:08:43,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

199
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,359
Speaker 0: A lot of people are rim type people.

200
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,277
Speaker 0: Bad people.

201
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,120
Speaker 0: Rim type is strong against everything.

202
00:08:48,501 --> 00:08:48,915
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

203
00:08:50,544 --> 00:08:52,259
Speaker 1: And also nothing is strong in spirit too.

204
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,600
Speaker 0: Rim used annoying noises against Scott.

205
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,760
Speaker 0: It's super effective.

206
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,218
Speaker 1: That's your only attack.

207
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:59,740
Speaker 1: Annoying noise, annoying noise, annoying noise and set clock.

208
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:03,940
Speaker 0: So you got a news?

209
00:09:04,825 --> 00:09:05,440
Speaker 1: I do have a news.

210
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,699
Speaker 1: It's a tiny, simple, basic news.

211
00:09:08,601 --> 00:09:11,480
Speaker 1: We've waited all summer and patience has been rewarded.

212
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,160
Speaker 1: Yo Apeta is coming back.

213
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:14,613
Speaker 1: Season two.

214
00:09:15,161 --> 00:09:21,900
Speaker 1: We're going to find out because that show, I don't know if people watched it after our completely a hundred percent accurate review of it.

215
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:23,956
Speaker 0: I'm only about halfway through it, but I really like it.

216
00:09:24,841 --> 00:09:45,560
Speaker 1: Uh, but basically they ended season one and they ended season one, not at the end of a race, not right before the end of a race, not at the beginning of a race, but they ended season one right before the end of the second day of a three day race.

217
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,277
Speaker 1: Are you kidding me?

218
00:09:48,122 --> 00:09:48,496
Speaker 0: You know what?

219
00:09:50,042 --> 00:09:56,640
Speaker 0: I have no complaints about that because I was watching Eska flow name as it was coming out and they murder a character.

220
00:09:56,700 --> 00:10:00,220
Speaker 1: And then in the episode immediately, but you're not sure if they're actually murdered or not.

221
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,840
Speaker 1: And then you have to wait for the next episode.

222
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:04,419
Speaker 0: And it turns out that they did that every episode.

223
00:10:04,987 --> 00:10:05,217
Speaker 1: Yes.

224
00:10:05,682 --> 00:10:06,019
Speaker 1: Everyone.

225
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:06,616
Speaker 0: Yup.

226
00:10:07,122 --> 00:10:22,500
Speaker 0: And also I point out that if you have the attack on Titan situation where it kind of ends in the middle of nowhere and there's a future horizon desert where no sign of life exists for more episodes, well, you can't read the manga cause it's terrible.

227
00:10:24,661 --> 00:10:27,239
Speaker 1: So shows come back like October something real soon.

228
00:10:27,521 --> 00:10:32,160
Speaker 1: So anyone who is a needs more bicycling, just hang tight a little longer.

229
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,019
Speaker 0: Basically got some time.

230
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,460
Speaker 0: Now is a good time to catch up on that show and be ready for the new season to come out.

231
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:43,380
Speaker 0: In fact, if you time it right, you can watch the end of the first season and then the next day it's just the next episode will come out and watch.

232
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,140
Speaker 1: It'll be glorious.

233
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,179
Speaker 0: Season two is going to start with like a multi episode flashback.

234
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:48,659
Speaker 1: It will be a miracle.

235
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:58,870
Speaker 0: So anyway, things of the day, this is the DuckTales theme with real ducks.

236
00:10:58,971 --> 00:11:00,509
Speaker 0: Like it's actually really cute.

237
00:11:01,214 --> 00:11:01,606
Speaker 0: That's all.

238
00:11:02,392 --> 00:11:13,410
Speaker 1: You should have just said what you told me, which is that it was a live action DuckTales theme and I expected it to be people in DuckTales cosplay, but the fact that it's actual ducks makes it actually really awesome and worth watching.

239
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:16,210
Speaker 0: This is, this is actually like super worth watching.

240
00:11:16,491 --> 00:11:17,149
Speaker 0: It's really cute.

241
00:11:17,452 --> 00:11:18,310
Speaker 0: Also baby ducks.

242
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:19,248
Speaker 0: Really cute.

243
00:11:19,713 --> 00:11:20,349
Speaker 1: It's my thing today.

244
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:30,110
Speaker 1: So eighties is basically a super cut of clips from movies, mostly from the eighties, perhaps nineties where there are arcade machines present.

245
00:11:30,511 --> 00:11:32,170
Speaker 0: No arcade was ever that cool.

246
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:36,330
Speaker 1: No arcade was ever like this ever for reals, but we all wish they were.

247
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,808
Speaker 1: And they were in movies and TV.

248
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,835
Speaker 1: So relive them.

249
00:11:39,915 --> 00:11:44,110
Speaker 1: eighties, Robocop, Terminator, Wizard, Tron, et cetera.

250
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:46,108
Speaker 1: You know, I don't know if I missed it or not.

251
00:11:46,470 --> 00:11:47,788
Speaker 1: The cooler and all more awesome you are.

252
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:50,190
Speaker 0: Because I did not see Hackers.

253
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:52,710
Speaker 1: When was there an arcade in Hackers?

254
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:58,270
Speaker 0: Hackers has a crazy arcade and that's how the two main characters start to fall in love.

255
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:59,410
Speaker 0: because she's really good at that game.

256
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,329
Speaker 0: I almost called her Trinity.

257
00:12:01,232 --> 00:12:05,169
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, I'm sure there's lots of movies that include arcades that were not in the super cut.

258
00:12:06,294 --> 00:12:07,567
Speaker 0: But so it's only a mega cut.

259
00:12:08,118 --> 00:12:08,244
Speaker 1: Yeah.

260
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:09,349
Speaker 1: It's a mega whatever.

261
00:12:09,633 --> 00:12:09,908
Speaker 0: That's fine.

262
00:12:10,974 --> 00:12:12,210
Speaker 0: You know, I want that.

263
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:16,670
Speaker 0: You know how that, you know, we have like sci fi from the fifties is like this sort of cool.

264
00:12:16,790 --> 00:12:19,370
Speaker 0: Like nowadays, like that's a really cool retro futurism aesthetic.

265
00:12:20,612 --> 00:12:24,270
Speaker 0: I want a retro arcade is an aesthetic like 20 years from now.

266
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:24,410
Speaker 0: Like.

267
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:28,430
Speaker 0: I want that kind of arcade aesthetic to be like super retro cool.

268
00:12:28,613 --> 00:12:29,590
Speaker 1: That's already an aesthetic.

269
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,270
Speaker 1: That's super retro.

270
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:32,550
Speaker 0: Cool to us, not to society.

271
00:12:33,673 --> 00:12:35,589
Speaker 0: Go find an arcade that looks like that.

272
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:36,469
Speaker 1: All right.

273
00:12:37,396 --> 00:12:37,586
Speaker 0: Yeah.

274
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:38,541
Speaker 0: All of them.

275
00:12:39,138 --> 00:12:39,350
Speaker 0: Where?

276
00:12:40,297 --> 00:12:40,929
Speaker 0: What arcades?

277
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,850
Speaker 1: The ones that old guys are running.

278
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:51,290
Speaker 0: The only arcades I've seen lately are the ones that are like a black barcade where they're basically just a bar and they have a token number of arcade machines.

279
00:12:51,390 --> 00:12:56,167
Speaker 0: They can at least say, Hey, uh, you cool hip kids who like arcade aesthetics come here and play.

280
00:12:56,573 --> 00:12:58,430
Speaker 0: But one is too loud to actually talk to anyone.

281
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:01,630
Speaker 0: Two, they have a pitiful number of games have a, which don't work.

282
00:13:01,970 --> 00:13:03,730
Speaker 0: And three, there's so many people in there.

283
00:13:03,830 --> 00:13:05,168
Speaker 0: You can't actually even play any of the games.

284
00:13:05,975 --> 00:13:06,590
Speaker 1: That's barcade.

285
00:13:06,676 --> 00:13:06,870
Speaker 1: Yeah.

286
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:07,159
Speaker 0: Yeah.

287
00:13:07,631 --> 00:13:07,906
Speaker 0: I want it.

288
00:13:08,050 --> 00:13:11,890
Speaker 0: I want an arcade that's as cool as the arcades in this mega cut.

289
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:15,010
Speaker 1: Go to retro arcade museum that we interviewed on this very podcast.

290
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,967
Speaker 0: Many moons ago, that plays shut down.

291
00:13:17,931 --> 00:13:23,165
Speaker 1: As you may recall, go to any of the other similar exactly same places run by similar folk.

292
00:13:23,433 --> 00:13:23,527
Speaker 0: Yeah.

293
00:13:23,632 --> 00:13:24,370
Speaker 0: Not that many people.

294
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:24,808
Speaker 0: And you know what?

295
00:13:24,990 --> 00:13:25,890
Speaker 0: They're usually mostly empty.

296
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,566
Speaker 0: When you go into them.

297
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:31,867
Speaker 0: You need, I want kids dressed like that dancing while they're playing an arcade movies.

298
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,650
Speaker 1: You'll have to hire actors and extras.

299
00:13:35,011 --> 00:13:36,169
Speaker 0: Now I want people to be that cool.

300
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:37,786
Speaker 1: No, one's going to wear those shoes.

301
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,366
Speaker 0: Those shoes weren't that bad.

302
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,268
Speaker 1: No, one's going to wear those pants.

303
00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:47,190
Speaker 0: So in the moment, uh, the book club book is canonical for Lebowitz.

304
00:13:48,072 --> 00:13:50,029
Speaker 1: I still have read two thirds of it, so I'll finish it.

305
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:57,930
Speaker 0: Um, while rims in Singapore, you'd better because, uh, I've got, I've got four 25 hour flights coming up in the near future.

306
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,729
Speaker 0: I'm going to read like three novels.

307
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:00,410
Speaker 0: Okay.

308
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,147
Speaker 0: So I think I'm going to pick my next book club book after Canada will leave one of those and just start it like right now.

309
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:06,710
Speaker 0: Okay.

310
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:08,406
Speaker 0: Thinking about doing water ship down.

311
00:14:09,236 --> 00:14:09,589
Speaker 0: Yeah.

312
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:09,922
Speaker 0: Yeah.

313
00:14:10,651 --> 00:14:11,150
Speaker 1: Yeah.

314
00:14:11,611 --> 00:14:17,489
Speaker 0: If you so much as even hesitate, I'm just going to do a counter Monte Cristo instead.

315
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:18,325
Speaker 1: Yeah.

316
00:14:25,135 --> 00:14:26,310
Speaker 1: And I do crime and punishment.

317
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:29,650
Speaker 0: I actually want to read that one, but I've read that book like three times.

318
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:30,764
Speaker 0: I don't need to read it again.

319
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:32,987
Speaker 1: Point point one time.

320
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:34,588
Speaker 0: God, you know what?

321
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,350
Speaker 0: Here's the moral of crime and punishment.

322
00:14:36,712 --> 00:14:39,410
Speaker 0: If you commit a crime, you need to be punished.

323
00:14:39,931 --> 00:14:44,170
Speaker 0: And if you get away with it, you're going to punish yourself because that's how humans work.

324
00:14:44,596 --> 00:14:45,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's fine.

325
00:14:45,838 --> 00:14:46,549
Speaker 0: The real moral.

326
00:14:46,851 --> 00:14:48,650
Speaker 0: You're not as clever as you think you are.

327
00:14:49,210 --> 00:14:49,356
Speaker 0: Yeah.

328
00:14:50,350 --> 00:14:50,966
Speaker 1: I still want to read it.

329
00:15:01,296 --> 00:15:02,589
Speaker 1: Let us continue using that.

330
00:15:03,170 --> 00:15:06,269
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good thing because anyone who gets that is like plus two to cool.

331
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:07,343
Speaker 1: Here we go.

332
00:15:08,390 --> 00:15:08,647
Speaker 0: So yeah.

333
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,910
Speaker 0: Uh, other announcements.

334
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:17,330
Speaker 0: Uh, I will be, geek nights will be, Scott will not be sadly at the penny arcade expo.

335
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:22,510
Speaker 1: that's coming up in 51 days in Australia on the complete other side of the earth.

336
00:15:23,310 --> 00:15:28,142
Speaker 1: If you guys want me to go there, send money like two or $3,000 of money American.

337
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:34,930
Speaker 0: Interestingly enough, I am on PayPal to my email address.

338
00:15:35,291 --> 00:15:41,229
Speaker 0: I am doing two lectures, one of which is basically the solo version of how to win every game on Sunday at noon.

339
00:15:41,531 --> 00:15:45,410
Speaker 0: So basically a version of what we just did at PAX prime.

340
00:15:45,994 --> 00:15:48,150
Speaker 0: And the other one is the other side of the coin.

341
00:15:48,890 --> 00:15:52,110
Speaker 0: I played around with a bunch of titles, but eventually I ended up just calling it losing.

342
00:15:53,231 --> 00:15:55,550
Speaker 0: So I'm doing losing on Saturday.

343
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,130
Speaker 1: You should have just changed the name of the other panel to winning.

344
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:58,581
Speaker 0: Yeah.

345
00:15:58,851 --> 00:15:59,670
Speaker 0: I thought about doing that.

346
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,990
Speaker 0: Actually, I still have four days to change the title before they go live.

347
00:16:04,792 --> 00:16:06,050
Speaker 0: I think I might just change.

348
00:16:06,370 --> 00:16:09,730
Speaker 0: I don't know though, because how to win every game is a pretty good title.

349
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:10,750
Speaker 0: Like it draws the right kind of guy.

350
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,069
Speaker 1: Make the other one how to lose every game.

351
00:16:12,651 --> 00:16:13,710
Speaker 0: Ah, except the point.

352
00:16:13,872 --> 00:16:14,327
Speaker 0: I don't know.

353
00:16:14,553 --> 00:16:15,065
Speaker 0: I don't know.

354
00:16:15,832 --> 00:16:16,226
Speaker 0: How should I go?

355
00:16:17,511 --> 00:16:19,669
Speaker 0: All this running through my head is symmetry, eh?

356
00:16:20,090 --> 00:16:20,469
Speaker 1: Symmetry.

357
00:16:22,032 --> 00:16:24,750
Speaker 1: We can't resist symmetry when you are a smart person.

358
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:26,222
Speaker 0: Let's not go to that Dr.

359
00:16:26,262 --> 00:16:26,870
Speaker 0: Hibbard anymore.

360
00:16:28,632 --> 00:16:30,030
Speaker 0: Do you get what I'm referencing?

361
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:30,419
Speaker 0: Yeah.

362
00:16:30,911 --> 00:16:31,390
Speaker 0: Do you really?

363
00:16:31,915 --> 00:16:32,590
Speaker 0: What am I referencing?

364
00:16:33,190 --> 00:16:37,846
Speaker 1: The Simpsons episode where Homer was getting like, there was.

365
00:16:37,866 --> 00:16:38,347
Speaker 1: no, it wasn't Homer.

366
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,349
Speaker 1: It was a dude came in and like stole all the organs.

367
00:16:41,972 --> 00:16:43,610
Speaker 0: No, I know which one you're thinking of.

368
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,641
Speaker 1: And there was the parents like.

369
00:16:44,661 --> 00:16:45,329
Speaker 1: Polly shouldn't be.

370
00:16:46,451 --> 00:16:49,730
Speaker 0: That's not the one I'm referencing, but that's actually pretty close.

371
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,729
Speaker 0: So I guess that counts.

372
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,288
Speaker 0: Okay.

373
00:16:51,531 --> 00:17:00,390
Speaker 0: I'm referencing the one where Homer is the one that's like a pulp fiction, sort of like a bunch of stuff happens in the Springfield and Homer gets his thumb cut off, I think.

374
00:17:00,510 --> 00:17:00,970
Speaker 0: Thumb or a finger.

375
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:01,288
Speaker 0: I forget.

376
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:02,509
Speaker 0: He gets a finger cut off.

377
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:04,355
Speaker 0: So they go to Dr.

378
00:17:04,395 --> 00:17:07,467
Speaker 0: Hibbard because they can't find the finger and Dr.

379
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:10,409
Speaker 0: Hibbard's like, well, I can't fix it without the finger.

380
00:17:10,851 --> 00:17:15,290
Speaker 0: But what I could do is cut the other one off for symmetry and Homer's like symmetry.

381
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:20,730
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'll be in Australia.

382
00:17:21,329 --> 00:17:24,950
Speaker 0: If you were going to be in Australia at Pax Australia, let me know.

383
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,270
Speaker 1: What else are you going to do in Australia alone besides Pax?

384
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:38,450
Speaker 0: Apparently, I don't know if I can announce this, so I won't, but a bunch of other people we know who are at Pax's who we may have been on panels with before are also going to be at Pax Australia.

385
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:38,886
Speaker 1: Sure.

386
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:39,689
Speaker 1: But what are you going to do?

387
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,810
Speaker 1: Are you going to go like the coral reef?

388
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:41,710
Speaker 1: You can see the penguins again?

389
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:42,749
Speaker 0: Oh, you mean outside of Pax?

390
00:17:43,033 --> 00:17:43,124
Speaker 1: Yeah.

391
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:44,269
Speaker 1: You're just going to come right back home.

392
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:47,250
Speaker 0: So I'm actually giving a talk at a different convention.

393
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:48,550
Speaker 1: For finance bullshit.

394
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:49,430
Speaker 1: The week before Pax.

395
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,450
Speaker 1: I'm talking about outside of conventions.

396
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:55,265
Speaker 0: I'm going to go to that Wilson's Promontory that you didn't want to go to and hike that fucker.

397
00:17:55,634 --> 00:17:55,805
Speaker 1: Okay.

398
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:56,197
Speaker 0: Yeah.

399
00:17:57,412 --> 00:17:58,770
Speaker 0: And I'm going to the beaches by Sydney.

400
00:17:59,190 --> 00:17:59,275
Speaker 1: Okay.

401
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:01,250
Speaker 0: And I'm going to do a bunch of stuff in Sydney.

402
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:05,540
Speaker 0: And I thought about biking between Sydney and Melbourne and I don't have time for that shit.

403
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:06,530
Speaker 0: So that's not happening.

404
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:07,889
Speaker 1: You're not going to the coral reef?

405
00:18:08,297 --> 00:18:08,889
Speaker 0: No, probably not.

406
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:09,420
Speaker 0: Good.

407
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:10,909
Speaker 0: I only have like two weeks.

408
00:18:11,191 --> 00:18:19,169
Speaker 0: I'm going to mostly do stuff like in and around Sydney and then I'm going to go past Melbourne all the way out to Wilson's Promontory and spend like an entire day hiking out there.

409
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,370
Speaker 0: That's pretty much what I'm doing.

410
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:21,947
Speaker 1: You'll be alone.

411
00:18:22,111 --> 00:18:22,587
Speaker 1: So don't die.

412
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:23,343
Speaker 0: Yeah.

413
00:18:23,512 --> 00:18:24,230
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll get some people.

414
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:27,809
Speaker 0: I think I convinced Kehil to go see the penguins.

415
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:28,509
Speaker 1: Oh.

416
00:18:29,391 --> 00:18:30,349
Speaker 0: You're going to see the penguins again?

417
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:38,030
Speaker 0: I don't know if I, you know what, I almost want to go see the penguins again now because those penguins were really, really, really, really cute.

418
00:18:38,150 --> 00:18:39,129
Speaker 1: They won't show up this time.

419
00:18:39,792 --> 00:18:42,650
Speaker 0: The thing is if they don't show up, I could be that guy who's there like, it's cool.

420
00:18:43,071 --> 00:18:43,809
Speaker 0: I've seen him already.

421
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:44,928
Speaker 0: I've seen this.

422
00:18:45,674 --> 00:18:46,589
Speaker 0: You guys, you missed it.

423
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:47,145
Speaker 0: The penguins.

424
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:47,667
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

425
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:48,186
Speaker 0: The penguins.

426
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:50,230
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'll be at PAX Australia.

427
00:18:50,751 --> 00:18:56,110
Speaker 0: And then we have no conventions until PAX South, which actually is not that far away.

428
00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:57,263
Speaker 1: It's the same time as Magfest.

429
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:00,009
Speaker 0: Which we're sadly not going to because PAX South.

430
00:19:01,351 --> 00:19:06,030
Speaker 1: Some guy recently on Craigslist, he got a free X-Men arcade machine.

431
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:10,429
Speaker 1: He just saw it on giveaway on Craigslist and got it.

432
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:15,030
Speaker 0: I need to set up a thing that watches Craigslist for anyone giving away an arcade cabinet.

433
00:19:15,537 --> 00:19:15,630
Speaker 1: Sure.

434
00:19:15,771 --> 00:19:16,487
Speaker 0: That's what I need to do.

435
00:19:17,255 --> 00:19:18,130
Speaker 0: I didn't know that happened.

436
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,550
Speaker 1: Where are you going to put a six player X-Men or is it eight player?

437
00:19:20,910 --> 00:19:21,250
Speaker 0: Living room.

438
00:19:21,931 --> 00:19:27,089
Speaker 0: There's like right in the middle of the living room, like between the living room-ish area and the dining-ish area.

439
00:19:29,079 --> 00:19:29,688
Speaker 0: I would put it there.

440
00:19:30,515 --> 00:19:32,590
Speaker 0: It takes up about as much space as a DDR machine.

441
00:19:34,531 --> 00:19:38,370
Speaker 0: Anyway, so you're going to die or you're going to make it through the show?

442
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:39,747
Speaker 1: So the show.

443
00:19:40,151 --> 00:19:40,608
Speaker 0: Captain Flems.

444
00:19:41,230 --> 00:19:41,330
Speaker 1: Yeah.

445
00:19:41,873 --> 00:19:42,090
Speaker 1: All right.

446
00:19:42,290 --> 00:19:48,029
Speaker 1: So someone messaged me on the internet and they said, "My name is

447
00:19:48,129 --> 00:19:48,370
Speaker 1: Omar.".

448
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:49,829
Speaker 1: Well, they didn't say that, but his name is Omar.

449
00:19:50,331 --> 00:19:50,727
Speaker 0: Which Omar?

450
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,749
Speaker 0: Is it Omar I know?

451
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,309
Speaker 1: Yes, the awesome Omar.

452
00:19:54,075 --> 00:19:54,589
Speaker 0: Omar Jenkins?

453
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:55,212
Speaker 1: No.

454
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:58,382
Speaker 1: Atomic Trivia War 9000 Omar.

455
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,054
Speaker 1: Okay.

456
00:19:59,510 --> 00:19:59,606
Speaker 0: Yeah.

457
00:19:59,751 --> 00:20:00,730
Speaker 0: That's the proper Omar.

458
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:01,367
Speaker 1: The good Omar.

459
00:20:01,630 --> 00:20:03,785
Speaker 1: And he said to me, "You should watch this

460
00:20:03,845 --> 00:20:04,107
Speaker 1: thing.".

461
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,625
Speaker 1: And I said the thing I usually say, which is, "I'll put it in that

462
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:07,927
Speaker 1: queue.".

463
00:20:08,713 --> 00:20:09,450
Speaker 1: And it went in the queue.

464
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:09,706
Speaker 0: Yeah.

465
00:20:09,810 --> 00:20:13,108
Speaker 0: In the queue is code for, "I will watch this when I'm retired with

466
00:20:13,169 --> 00:20:13,430
Speaker 0: Scott.".

467
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:14,130
Speaker 1: That is correct.

468
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:14,337
Speaker 0: Yup.

469
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,030
Speaker 1: But then, as with most things in the world- He kept seeing it around.

470
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:19,727
Speaker 1: As with Monica.

471
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:22,590
Speaker 0: You saw a bear poop in the woods and there was just bears everywhere.

472
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:32,019
Speaker 1: And as with other things, I saw that bear not only shitting in the woods, shitting in the lake, shitting in the park, shitting in my house- I mean- Shitting in my bed.

473
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:36,480
Speaker 0: I saw people talking about this on Twitter all the time.

474
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:42,396
Speaker 1: I saw a whole bunch of tweets about it and I saw links to it and I was like, "Well, this thing keeps coming up.

475
00:20:44,780 --> 00:20:46,477
Speaker 1: Guess I'll pay attention to it

476
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:46,719
Speaker 1: more.".

477
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:51,158
Speaker 1: Moved up in the queue, but didn't move to the front of the queue because I got no time for that.

478
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:55,091
Speaker 1: I haven't unpacked from the woods or from packs and my apartment's a disaster and my life.

479
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:55,558
Speaker 1: Oh my God.

480
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:58,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott, as awesome as the woods was, you know what I did?

481
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:02,060
Speaker 0: Unpacked, edited video, got my shit together.

482
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:05,380
Speaker 1: My shit is un-together still and I have to go to work tomorrow morning.

483
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,780
Speaker 0: Jimmy's at maximum rustling.

484
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,196
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, but today I was like, "Oh shit, we got to do an episode on

485
00:21:13,257 --> 00:21:13,598
Speaker 1: something.".

486
00:21:14,461 --> 00:21:19,259
Speaker 1: And I said, "Hey, why didn't we do the episode on this thing that moved up in the

487
00:21:19,299 --> 00:21:19,520
Speaker 1: queue?".

488
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,516
Speaker 0: First I said, "Hey, let's talk about Sailor Moon up to this point,".

489
00:21:22,557 --> 00:21:24,460
Speaker 0: but Scott's falling behind on the Sailor Moon bandwidth.

490
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:27,680
Speaker 1: I haven't watched Sailor Moon since I last watched Sailor Moon, which is not recent.

491
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,020
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, so it was a brief update.

492
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:31,960
Speaker 0: Sailor Moon Crystal got slightly better with the most recent episode.

493
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,780
Speaker 0: How is that possible?

494
00:21:33,622 --> 00:21:34,759
Speaker 0: So they introduced Sailor Jupiter.

495
00:21:35,081 --> 00:21:36,100
Speaker 1: Did they redo the animations?

496
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,360
Speaker 0: They introduced Sailor Jupiter.

497
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,620
Speaker 0: Her transformation is almost passable and she had three distinct facial expressions.

498
00:21:47,143 --> 00:21:50,579
Speaker 0: And Amy said something funny and smirked a little bit.

499
00:21:52,424 --> 00:21:53,539
Speaker 0: So stuff might be happening.

500
00:21:54,403 --> 00:21:55,900
Speaker 0: They might be getting their shit together finally.

501
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:57,120
Speaker 1: So I'm still going to watch the old one.

502
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:02,560
Speaker 0: Also there's this scene where Mamoru was like, "Wow, there's Usagi and she's passed out.

503
00:22:02,942 --> 00:22:04,135
Speaker 0: I'm going to lean over her and kiss

504
00:22:04,176 --> 00:22:04,257
Speaker 0: her.".

505
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:08,960
Speaker 0: And then that scene goes on for a while and out of context is really creepy.

506
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:12,098
Speaker 0: And then Luna comes over and she's basically like, "The fuck are you

507
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:12,440
Speaker 0: doing?".

508
00:22:12,543 --> 00:22:12,914
Speaker 0: He's like,

509
00:22:12,955 --> 00:22:12,996
Speaker 0: "Ah!"

510
00:22:13,141 --> 00:22:13,659
Speaker 0: And he runs away.

511
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:15,315
Speaker 0: That's it.

512
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,839
Speaker 0: So anyway, we watched this thing.

513
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:27,860
Speaker 1: So first of all, I know it's Wednesday and this is a live action show, but it has everything to do with manga that it could possibly have to do with.

514
00:22:28,222 --> 00:22:29,100
Speaker 0: Yes, and anime.

515
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:32,559
Speaker 1: It's called Blue Blazes or Aoi Hono.

516
00:22:33,144 --> 00:22:33,717
Speaker 0: Aoi Hono.

517
00:22:34,243 --> 00:22:35,057
Speaker 1: Blue Blazes.

518
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:36,860
Speaker 1: Probably pronouncing that mad wrong.

519
00:22:37,505 --> 00:22:37,819
Speaker 0: I don't know.

520
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:38,619
Speaker 0: Aoi means blue.

521
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,999
Speaker 0: I guess Hono means Blazes.

522
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:41,880
Speaker 1: I guess.

523
00:22:42,020 --> 00:22:43,100
Speaker 1: The guy's name is Hono.

524
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:43,920
Speaker 1: The main character.

525
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:44,287
Speaker 0: Yep.

526
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:52,657
Speaker 0: It's based on a manga and I don't really want to spoil some of the things that happen, like why the show is great.

527
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:53,419
Speaker 1: So here's the deal.

528
00:22:53,520 --> 00:23:00,819
Speaker 1: It's about this guy and we found out it's somewhat autobiographical of the manga author, but it's super dramaticized.

529
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:04,159
Speaker 0: It's almost as if- You know how dramaticized it is?

530
00:23:05,001 --> 00:23:17,260
Speaker 0: What I can only describe as a low rent version of the theme from Venus Wars plays in the background five or six times in the course of this first episode while he's on screen.

531
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:33,940
Speaker 1: So imagine if you had like the, it's the story of this manga author in college, except it's super dramatized to where he's basically a hot blooded anime hero character, but he's just in college doing college stuff.

532
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,860
Speaker 0: He's reading Shonen Magazine and he sees Ursa Edsura.

533
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,718
Speaker 1: He's like- I was gonna say it, sir.

534
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:40,840
Speaker 1: It was some baseball thing, Nine.

535
00:23:41,302 --> 00:23:42,339
Speaker 0: No, I was talking about later.

536
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:51,752
Speaker 0: He sees it and he's like, "Rumiko Takahashi, I respect your skill, but I don't think this is the place for that

537
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:52,237
Speaker 0: comic.".

538
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,300
Speaker 1: Yeah, Shonen Sunday is not the place.

539
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:03,836
Speaker 0: You are going in the wrong direction and the whole time the camera's zooming in on him dramatically while he's delivering this monologue to her remotely.

540
00:24:03,856 --> 00:24:06,299
Speaker 0: and then the girl he's with is like, "Why don't you just talk to

541
00:24:06,339 --> 00:24:06,400
Speaker 0: her?".

542
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,440
Speaker 0: And he's like, "Yes, I will.

543
00:24:09,062 --> 00:24:11,613
Speaker 0: I will send her a fan

544
00:24:11,713 --> 00:24:12,115
Speaker 0: letter.".

545
00:24:15,193 --> 00:24:15,719
Speaker 1: It's pretty crazy.

546
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,520
Speaker 0: This guy has exactly three modes.

547
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:28,139
Speaker 0: He's either full on crazy, silently crazy with serial killer eyes, or completely silent reading a manga.

548
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:32,030
Speaker 1: But everyone around him is not 100% normal, but not as crazy as him.

549
00:24:35,423 --> 00:24:36,118
Speaker 0: Except for Anno.

550
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:37,407
Speaker 1: Sure.

551
00:24:38,820 --> 00:24:49,860
Speaker 1: But he has friends that are otaku, that are somewhat stereotypical, but at least they're sort of weirded out when he does crazy shit, like start yelling or running around.

552
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:55,829
Speaker 0: Well, in the very beginning, he's reading this baseball manga, Nine, or Ben, Baseball, Nine.

553
00:24:56,140 --> 00:25:04,920
Speaker 0: And he's looking at it and he's talking to himself quietly, but it was kind of a Black Dynamite moment where Black Dynamite looks up and sees the microphone that's hanging in the frame.

554
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:10,185
Speaker 0: The girl sitting on the bus next to him is looking over at him like, "What the fuck are you doing,

555
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:10,589
Speaker 0: dude?".

556
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:23,139
Speaker 0: And the whole show is like that, but imagine if there was a college, and in this class, everyone who mattered to anime in the '80s was all in the same class, and they were all rivals.

557
00:25:23,381 --> 00:25:24,379
Speaker 1: I think the class is real.

558
00:25:24,722 --> 00:25:24,830
Speaker 0: Yes.

559
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:27,474
Speaker 0: And that is what this show is.

560
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:39,960
Speaker 1: And it's really hard, so it's hard to describe- It's like history of anime and manga, plus anime and manga styling on a live action show.

561
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:45,339
Speaker 0: I don't want to ruin the moment, because there's this moment where you kind of realize what the deal with this show is.

562
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:52,740
Speaker 0: And it's basically when they make the flip books and he's like, "I am the best at everything.

563
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:55,070
Speaker 0: I could just quit school right now and get a job,".

564
00:25:55,131 --> 00:25:59,419
Speaker 0: because his girlfriend girl is like- Who's not actually his girlfriend, but kind of his girlfriend.

565
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:01,660
Speaker 1: Badminton team leader's girlfriend.

566
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're going out on dates, and they're friends, and it's weird.

567
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:04,859
Speaker 1: It's weird.

568
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,016
Speaker 0: And she's like, "You're pretty

569
00:26:06,037 --> 00:26:06,200
Speaker 0: good.".

570
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:07,373
Speaker 0: He's like, "I'm the

571
00:26:07,434 --> 00:26:07,798
Speaker 0: best.".

572
00:26:08,102 --> 00:26:08,939
Speaker 1: And she's weird too.

573
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:10,940
Speaker 1: You can't tell if she's serious or not.

574
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:15,178
Speaker 0: Yeah, she's completely deadpan, and she's got three whooshes in her hair that really stand out.

575
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, anime style.

576
00:26:16,763 --> 00:26:16,900
Speaker 0: Yep.

577
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:22,179
Speaker 0: And he's like, "I am the best," and he makes the flip book, and he's like, "I have made a flip book.

578
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,466
Speaker 0: The images move

579
00:26:23,828 --> 00:26:24,694
Speaker 0: dynamically.".

580
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:30,178
Speaker 0: And then he gets to class, and everyone in the class is flipping out about this other flip book.

581
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,159
Speaker 0: They're like, "Oh my God.

582
00:26:31,541 --> 00:26:32,600
Speaker 0: You got to see what Anno did.

583
00:26:32,762 --> 00:26:32,948
Speaker 0: Oh my

584
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:33,259
Speaker 0: God.".

585
00:26:33,922 --> 00:26:46,300
Speaker 0: And you go over there, and the moment that makes this show is him seeing Anno's flip book and reacting to it, followed by Anno reacting to him in the next major scene.

586
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:46,799
Speaker 1: Yep.

587
00:26:48,260 --> 00:27:04,280
Speaker 1: If you like anime and manga, and you know something about the history of anime and manga- The fact that one of the characters in the show is an actor pretending to be Hideaki Anno in college- And that actor- Is already ridiculous enough.

588
00:27:04,700 --> 00:27:07,840
Speaker 0: When they show him, there's this glare on the glasses.

589
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,740
Speaker 1: He's pretty much always in gendo pose all the time.

590
00:27:13,222 --> 00:27:17,320
Speaker 0: Or in what's-his-name is like, "I can't draw, and I have no intention of ever drawing.

591
00:27:17,561 --> 00:27:18,328
Speaker 0: I want to be a

592
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:19,619
Speaker 0: producer.".

593
00:27:21,655 --> 00:27:21,780
Speaker 1: Yeah.

594
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:29,419
Speaker 1: But it's just hilarious how the things they're doing in the show, making movies and animations and whatever, right?

595
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:35,940
Speaker 1: But the show itself is also using the same film techniques to make the show look like a manga.

596
00:27:36,141 --> 00:27:40,937
Speaker 1: And in fact, even the things the characters in the show are making were made by the people who made the show.

597
00:27:41,943 --> 00:27:49,260
Speaker 1: It's so 80s and so apt and so- But whoever's making this is just so skilled, right?

598
00:27:50,102 --> 00:27:51,680
Speaker 1: The TV company, whoever.

599
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:54,820
Speaker 0: Though at the same time, it makes it difficult to recommend this to everyone.

600
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:55,735
Speaker 1: If you- Oh, no.

601
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:02,678
Speaker 1: If you don't understand anime- If you don't recognize the name- And manga, this will just be insanity to you, and you'll be like, "What the fuck was

602
00:28:02,718 --> 00:28:02,899
Speaker 1: that?".

603
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,899
Speaker 0: You got to at least know who Anno is.

604
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:10,131
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if you're an anime or manga person, this will be the greatest thing that you will see.

605
00:28:11,061 --> 00:28:22,119
Speaker 0: So there's a moment where the crowd reacts to the film that Anno and his team made at the end of the episode, and then Anno gets mad and yells at a bunch of people for the way they reacted.

606
00:28:22,701 --> 00:28:28,853
Speaker 0: And in my mind, all I can imagine is what he was saying to people when they said, "You should really make an Evangelion

607
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:29,338
Speaker 0: movie.".

608
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, so think about how- No encore!

609
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:34,040
Speaker 0: There will be no encore!

610
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:39,980
Speaker 1: Think about how less funny that scene is if you don't know who the heck Anno is, right?

611
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:51,719
Speaker 0: So if you have at least a cursory knowledge of the basic history of anime and some of the names of studios and names of people, you know who Anno is and some of the things he did, you can enjoy this.

612
00:28:52,601 --> 00:28:58,639
Speaker 0: If you don't know any of those things, you really should learn those things first and not watch this until you do.

613
00:28:59,321 --> 00:29:00,660
Speaker 1: Also, why don't you know those things?

614
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:05,600
Speaker 1: Because you're nerdy in anime, manga-ish comic enough to listen to this episode of Geek Nights on a Wednesday.

615
00:29:06,481 --> 00:29:07,619
Speaker 1: How come you don't know those things?

616
00:29:08,040 --> 00:29:09,940
Speaker 0: Scott, I only listen for the comic talk.

617
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:11,320
Speaker 0: I only like superheroes.

618
00:29:11,720 --> 00:29:12,818
Speaker 1: We hardly ever do that ever.

619
00:29:13,845 --> 00:29:14,160
Speaker 0: I know.

620
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,299
Speaker 1: Also, go watch Neon Genesis Evangelion.
