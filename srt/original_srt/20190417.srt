1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,961
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday April 17th 2019.

2
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:15,490
Speaker 1: I'm rim, I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,830 --> 00:00:19,680
Speaker 1: We have our final full thoughts of adventure time.

4
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:22,537
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:32,205
Speaker 1: So yesterday we we finally went me Scott and Judith who was recently on geek nights to go see us Because I generally had I don't.

6
00:00:32,386 --> 00:00:33,951
Speaker 0: I don't see us all the time.

7
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:35,656
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't see.

8
00:00:35,897 --> 00:00:36,680
Speaker 0: I see us right now.

9
00:00:37,584 --> 00:00:40,858
Speaker 1: I don't see a lot of horror movies in the theater because a lot of them.

10
00:00:40,878 --> 00:00:43,091
Speaker 1: well also I don't tend to see a lot of movies in the theater.

11
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:59,820
Speaker 1: the movie has to be like an a-plus Important movie or has to have some reason for me to see it in the theater as opposed to just seeing it via the high seas or Netflix later, but Horror movies are few and far between unless you count a really really shitty horror movies.

12
00:01:00,524 --> 00:01:02,314
Speaker 1: So us is a hundred percent worth seeing.

13
00:01:02,354 --> 00:01:03,340
Speaker 1: it's a legit horror movie.

14
00:01:03,380 --> 00:01:05,467
Speaker 1: it's good and we saw it last night.

15
00:01:05,507 --> 00:01:22,640
Speaker 1: and the only thing I got to say without getting into a review of it is that when you live in New York City, and you see a spooky movie the walk home is Very not spooky compared to the travel home in any other place.

16
00:01:23,581 --> 00:01:32,120
Speaker 1: Like I remember as a kid we'd see a horror movie and then there was like the quiet drive through the dark roads home And then the house is all dark and you lock all the doors.

17
00:01:32,822 --> 00:01:47,239
Speaker 1: It's hard to think about spooky stuff in New York when there's just like a bunch of people in the street everywhere And it doesn't actually ever get dark because of the light pollution And there's just like stuff going on everywhere and you get to an apartment that has a doorman and like one door.

18
00:01:47,782 --> 00:01:49,080
Speaker 1: That's the only way into the apartment.

19
00:01:50,561 --> 00:01:55,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, you know try to try to make a horror movie that takes place in New York City.

20
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:58,310
Speaker 0: This is actually scary is my heart all horrible.

21
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:58,872
Speaker 1: I got one.

22
00:01:59,274 --> 00:02:00,960
Speaker 1: so you get on a subway train.

23
00:02:01,483 --> 00:02:04,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, you realize it's the hobo car.

24
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:06,226
Speaker 1: The doors lock.

25
00:02:06,266 --> 00:02:06,527
Speaker 0: This is

26
00:02:06,547 --> 00:02:08,211
Speaker 1: my horror movie and then the power goes

27
00:02:08,332 --> 00:02:12,123
Speaker 0: out usually start including the one we just saw us With people

28
00:02:12,383 --> 00:02:13,266
Speaker 1: leaving the city

29
00:02:13,326 --> 00:02:21,358
Speaker 0: going somewhere remote and out of touch right like you know one of the best horror movies ever Maybe the best you know John Carpenter is the thing they go to?

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,622
Speaker 0: Antarctica.

31
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,365
Speaker 0: yeah, it's like.

32
00:02:23,385 --> 00:02:25,151
Speaker 0: I know it's horrifying.

33
00:02:25,192 --> 00:02:32,237
Speaker 1: It's like when you're a kid and you're in your house You'll hear like a creak in the distance or like something taps on the window, or there's a noise outside.

34
00:02:32,257 --> 00:02:35,218
Speaker 1: in New York It's just like seven train went by again.

35
00:02:36,762 --> 00:02:40,999
Speaker 1: There are literally millions of people within like a quarter mile radius of me.

36
00:02:42,224 --> 00:02:44,180
Speaker 1: If there was a ghost that ghost is waiting in line.

37
00:02:45,522 --> 00:02:46,647
Speaker 1: So I got any news.

38
00:02:47,612 --> 00:02:48,557
Speaker 0: I do add some news.

39
00:02:48,577 --> 00:02:52,099
Speaker 0: so Initial D is a thing.

40
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:59,000
Speaker 0: Right It is a thing that started out as a manga and that was adapted into anime and video games.

41
00:02:59,421 --> 00:03:01,971
Speaker 0: The arcade video games are very good.

42
00:03:02,071 --> 00:03:04,058
Speaker 0: Maybe those are the best initial D thing there is.

43
00:03:04,259 --> 00:03:07,614
Speaker 1: yeah The every initially arcade game is just better than the last one.

44
00:03:07,674 --> 00:03:10,286
Speaker 0: the anime is not good But I like it anyway.

45
00:03:10,608 --> 00:03:13,782
Speaker 1: the anime is good at being something I like.

46
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:16,569
Speaker 0: the anime gets worse over time.

47
00:03:16,589 --> 00:03:26,156
Speaker 0: so the very first season is the best and as it gets newer and newer later seasons And movies and as you go on dumber and dumber and dumber it gets better animation.

48
00:03:26,236 --> 00:03:32,953
Speaker 0: by some measures The cars look better kind of yeah, but it just gets worse.

49
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:37,757
Speaker 0: just watch the first 26 episodes of initial D. If you're gonna watch anyway, maybe you shouldn't.

50
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:51,738
Speaker 1: the 26th episode of the original initial D Just ends and like this sort of poignant moment and a character had an arc and it's like a real story and after that It's just like project D. We're still erasing cars on this mountain for some reason.

51
00:03:51,758 --> 00:03:52,400
Speaker 0: yeah anyway.

52
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:58,360
Speaker 0: And then there is the manga the original thing which is poorly drawn except for the cars poorly written.

53
00:03:59,102 --> 00:04:04,271
Speaker 0: Yeah, when it was released in America originally I bought every volume the Tokyo pop put out.

54
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:05,235
Speaker 1: I kept reading it.

55
00:04:05,275 --> 00:04:05,958
Speaker 1: Scott would buy it.

56
00:04:05,998 --> 00:04:07,319
Speaker 1: He'd read it He'd put it in the pile.

57
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,171
Speaker 1: I would pick it up off that pile, and I would read it.

58
00:04:09,272 --> 00:04:10,580
Speaker 0: they put out all the volumes.

59
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:14,695
Speaker 0: They renamed some of the characters talk which people got really mad about.

60
00:04:14,776 --> 00:04:30,068
Speaker 0: right yes instead of Itsuki and Takumi And They've made some other modifications that you know whatever But they only put out I think 30-something volumes.

61
00:04:30,189 --> 00:04:32,276
Speaker 0: basically I think there are four or five volumes.

62
00:04:32,316 --> 00:04:33,580
Speaker 0: They didn't put out they just stopped.

63
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,388
Speaker 0: I bought all of them and then got rid of all of them.

64
00:04:36,251 --> 00:04:37,276
Speaker 1: I just can't imagine.

65
00:04:37,316 --> 00:04:38,199
Speaker 0: What could have happened.

66
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:46,676
Speaker 0: Anyway, if you are the kind of person who wants to read the initial D. Manga I believe this is not the Tokyo pop translation.

67
00:04:46,836 --> 00:04:47,540
Speaker 1: Oh, thanks, Satan.

68
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:48,705
Speaker 0: I believe it's not.

69
00:04:48,846 --> 00:04:51,800
Speaker 0: I can't imagine it would be because it's being put up by wait wait wait.

70
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:57,170
Speaker 1: No, I think it is because from the article Comixology describes the stories.

71
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,759
Speaker 1: this is quoting Comixology.

72
00:04:59,386 --> 00:05:02,345
Speaker 1: Tak Fujiwara Spends his time.

73
00:05:02,667 --> 00:05:06,580
Speaker 0: maybe maybe it is the same translation, but it's being not put out by Tokyo pop.

74
00:05:07,162 --> 00:05:10,314
Speaker 0: But it's now available not in physical print anymore.

75
00:05:10,334 --> 00:05:16,018
Speaker 0: It is now digitally available Including all the volumes right up to the end are now.

76
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:27,220
Speaker 0: So the part that I could never read before because it was never available before is now digitally available in the United States on Comixology and all associated digital platforms.

77
00:05:27,561 --> 00:05:34,080
Speaker 1: I guess if you really got to find out if he ever loses a race other than that one race the one where his engine Exploded he didn't really lose.

78
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,480
Speaker 0: He's kind of lost yeah.

79
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,120
Speaker 0: And it's kind of like when Astro boy needs to lose to get powered up and come back stronger.

80
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, because then they get that magic naturally aspirated engine season power up.

81
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:50,140
Speaker 1: You know by pretending to lose that magic engine they put in the 86 he still just can't get over anyway.

82
00:05:50,863 --> 00:05:58,311
Speaker 0: The point is you if you really want to for some reason read all the initial D Manga like I will soon have done.

83
00:05:58,371 --> 00:06:00,579
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can go now and do that.

84
00:06:02,264 --> 00:06:05,973
Speaker 1: Very important is whenever the cars are driving while you're reading the manga.

85
00:06:06,234 --> 00:06:07,557
Speaker 1: put some euro bead on.

86
00:06:07,858 --> 00:06:10,549
Speaker 0: while you're reading it You got to play euro bead on the on the stereo.

87
00:06:10,750 --> 00:06:11,293
Speaker 1: deja vu.

88
00:06:11,534 --> 00:06:12,580
Speaker 1: I've just been in this place.

89
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:15,668
Speaker 0: Also those pages flip through them real fast.

90
00:06:15,688 --> 00:06:17,474
Speaker 0: You can read this manga like in a few minutes.

91
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:18,197
Speaker 1: I mean half the pages.

92
00:06:18,237 --> 00:06:20,259
Speaker 1: just cars cars.

93
00:06:21,462 --> 00:06:23,310
Speaker 1: Talking me says something cars now.

94
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:27,851
Speaker 1: There's a whole bunch of drama with like and the Linger on it.

95
00:06:28,216 --> 00:06:40,139
Speaker 0: Yep alright, so in a Not so good news right there is a person who you may know monkey punch named monkey punch Whose real name escapes me?

96
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:45,957
Speaker 0: But it's written all over the internet now because sadly the person known as monkey punch has passed away at the.

97
00:06:45,977 --> 00:06:48,446
Speaker 0: I could Accept this age of 81.

98
00:06:48,446 --> 00:06:50,453
Speaker 0: I think they said 81 and from 81.

99
00:06:50,453 --> 00:06:58,479
Speaker 1: from what I've read Dude was really active and happy and like kicking ass as recently as when he was a.

100
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:01,080
Speaker 0: yeah It didn't fade away in some sad hospice or anything.

101
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:11,159
Speaker 0: yeah, but monkey punch is the creator of Lupin the third and also a really good artist and Also, you know someone who liked a bit of a bit of lewdness.

102
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:12,887
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's a. it's a.

103
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:24,833
Speaker 0: it's a more elegant lewdness from a more civilized age But generally an awesome amazing dude and artist Who created a legendary set of characters that have still keep.

104
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:27,320
Speaker 0: they still keep making more Lupin shit even to this day.

105
00:07:27,503 --> 00:07:30,287
Speaker 0: Not only that Lupin is decades old.

106
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:36,350
Speaker 1: there was an era where Lupin specials would come out and they were not great But there weren't always good.

107
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,275
Speaker 0: but they just keep coming.

108
00:07:37,537 --> 00:07:47,265
Speaker 1: but the Relatively recent Lupin's basically everything they've made from fujiko Mina onward is at least B Plus a minus level Lupin.

109
00:07:47,546 --> 00:07:55,168
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's it's kind of sad because like, you know monkey punch made a lot of other stuff That wasn't Lupin but basically was only known for Lupin.

110
00:07:55,388 --> 00:08:06,052
Speaker 1: only Lupin was successful and basically was like, you know in terms of Making money, it's like the guy who made snatch nothing He ever made after that or before that will be remembered.

111
00:08:06,273 --> 00:08:07,680
Speaker 1: or know anyone care about it.

112
00:08:08,201 --> 00:08:13,700
Speaker 0: But it's like, you know, he made Guy Ritchie made other movies that were basically also like snatch.

113
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,389
Speaker 0: Yeah, the problem is that they were.

114
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:22,494
Speaker 0: but you know the same thing can be said of To mix, you know any other director was a Tim Burton.

115
00:08:22,514 --> 00:08:24,440
Speaker 0: You can tell a Tim Burton thing when you look at it, right?

116
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,995
Speaker 0: Yeah, but he's making different stuff.

117
00:08:27,022 --> 00:08:33,080
Speaker 0: But monkey punch rode on one thing didn't make other lupin ish things that were successful?

118
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:36,903
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, but yeah Kind of sad.

119
00:08:37,323 --> 00:08:41,618
Speaker 0: but you know also, you know, I guess kind of good people remember Lupin.

120
00:08:41,717 --> 00:08:43,746
Speaker 0: yet again Lupin's not going anywhere.

121
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:59,980
Speaker 1: So speaking of which if you live in New York There's a theater in Brooklyn called Nighthawk cinema and Nighthawk cinema is a place that serves food Like you put your order in when you sit down in your assigned seat or whatever and then they're like you write your order down.

122
00:09:00,020 --> 00:09:00,562
Speaker 1: It's fancy.

123
00:09:00,682 --> 00:09:05,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, no waitress comes and brings you like booze and fancy food and it's a full-on movie theater.

124
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,629
Speaker 1: Otherwise, like you don't even have to pay your check.

125
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,940
Speaker 1: You just like leave because they'd like put it on your credit card.

126
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:10,443
Speaker 1: It's fine.

127
00:09:10,463 --> 00:09:15,485
Speaker 1: It's awesome, but they Often show anime there.

128
00:09:15,686 --> 00:09:23,771
Speaker 0: They often show lots of things there because you know, you're not gonna you're not gonna just do the Dinner movie thing for just like the latest top movie, right?

129
00:09:23,871 --> 00:09:26,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know, they're not gonna pay to get the latest top movie.

130
00:09:26,661 --> 00:09:31,540
Speaker 1: But last weekend they did a brunch movie on Saturday where they showed metropolis, which is a good movie.

131
00:09:31,661 --> 00:09:33,533
Speaker 0: It's not not Fritz Lang's metropolis.

132
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,460
Speaker 1: Oh the anime one.

133
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:43,394
Speaker 1: Yeah, the way the anime one that if you don't know if you don't know why metropolis the movie was made Then it's probably just confusing but I digress.

134
00:09:43,414 --> 00:09:44,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, Rintaro is metropolis.

135
00:09:44,761 --> 00:09:47,215
Speaker 0: I feel like you have to see before you can watch metropolis.

136
00:09:47,235 --> 00:09:50,674
Speaker 0: You have to see Metropolis yeah, then you have to see.

137
00:09:50,694 --> 00:09:53,725
Speaker 0: you have to read Tezuka's manga metropolis.

138
00:09:54,046 --> 00:09:55,410
Speaker 0: then you have to watch at least one.

139
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:58,400
Speaker 0: Tezuka anime could just be like an episode of Astro boy or something.

140
00:09:58,601 --> 00:10:02,194
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you gotta finally like you're nearly right.

141
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,686
Speaker 0: and then you got to see a Rintaro movie Like maybe Galaxy Express or something.

142
00:10:05,706 --> 00:10:09,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then you can watch metropolis the movie and understand what the hell's going on.

143
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:16,646
Speaker 1: But this weekend in a few days on Saturday at 10 45 a.m They are screening is a brunch movie.

144
00:10:16,987 --> 00:10:24,191
Speaker 0: Lupin the third the castle of Cagliostro might be the one of the best Lupin movies Directed by Miyazaki.

145
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:30,717
Speaker 1: It is the best Lupin movie with the caveat that it is nothing like any other.

146
00:10:30,817 --> 00:10:34,569
Speaker 0: it is the least Lupin ish, but the best at being a movie.

147
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:37,899
Speaker 0: Yep, maybe the worst at being Lupin ish.

148
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,680
Speaker 1: It depends on what color jacket you're talking about.

149
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:47,425
Speaker 0: Yeah, but anyway, and they didn't just schedule this because of the passing of I bought tickets this a while ago But it's not sold.

150
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:48,390
Speaker 0: I've seen it recently.

151
00:10:48,430 --> 00:10:50,140
Speaker 0: So I don't really feel like I need to go again.

152
00:10:50,423 --> 00:10:51,540
Speaker 1: I have not seen it recently.

153
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:58,786
Speaker 1: So if you live in New York and have not seen any Lupin Go to Night Dog Cinema on Saturday and see the castle of Cagliostro.

154
00:10:58,906 --> 00:11:00,228
Speaker 0: Oh 20 and also.

155
00:11:00,248 --> 00:11:01,490
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I guess it is.

156
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,229
Speaker 1: And also the following Saturday plays it.

157
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:08,760
Speaker 1: they're showing in the same brunch format penguin highway.

158
00:11:10,182 --> 00:11:14,517
Speaker 0: So maybe that will be the thing that I go and then on my schedule a and then we can review that.

159
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:20,534
Speaker 1: the only problem Is oh, yes, so Saturday they always do this Saturday and Sunday.

160
00:11:20,574 --> 00:11:21,819
Speaker 1: So it is also Sunday.

161
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,906
Speaker 1: Saturday is always subbed.

162
00:11:24,107 --> 00:11:25,272
Speaker 1: Sunday is always dubbed.

163
00:11:25,472 --> 00:11:27,340
Speaker 1: Oh, no, so, uh, you know what to do.

164
00:11:29,821 --> 00:11:30,844
Speaker 0: So Saturday is subbed.

165
00:11:30,924 --> 00:11:32,409
Speaker 0: Saturday subbed the 27th.

166
00:11:32,449 --> 00:11:34,034
Speaker 0: you say the 27th.

167
00:11:34,315 --> 00:11:35,137
Speaker 0: my schedule is good.

168
00:11:35,237 --> 00:11:35,959
Speaker 1: I think mine's good, too.

169
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:37,283
Speaker 1: I think we should do it.

170
00:11:37,403 --> 00:11:41,031
Speaker 0: Maybe yeah, see some anime penguin highway plus brunch.

171
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:51,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, it's time for wings of the day.

172
00:11:51,405 --> 00:11:51,953
Speaker 1: What do you got?

173
00:11:52,176 --> 00:11:52,359
Speaker 1: so?

174
00:11:53,101 --> 00:11:58,479
Speaker 0: Normally, I hate commercials and I won't block all ads right, but there are those occasions where?

175
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:05,960
Speaker 0: Advertisements happen to be made are also works of art, right like a segata sashiro, right?

176
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,083
Speaker 0: That's a good example.

177
00:12:07,244 --> 00:12:14,828
Speaker 0: or you know various Super Bowl commercials, you know, you have a lot of old-school ads You know, they had really good design and stuff going right.

178
00:12:14,848 --> 00:12:21,871
Speaker 0: so it's hard to separate that like block all ads Which you should do in your daily life always especially on the internet.

179
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,419
Speaker 0: where can mess up your computer with evil malicious ads?

180
00:12:25,822 --> 00:12:30,400
Speaker 0: But also someone says he recognized the art of ads, right?

181
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,804
Speaker 0: So here is an ad.

182
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:37,351
Speaker 0: for unless we got any Thai listeners any listeners in Thailand shout out Yeah, that'd be awesome.

183
00:12:37,372 --> 00:12:47,679
Speaker 0: If we had a listener in Thailand I don't think I don't think we do so which means I don't think anyone listening is Very unlikely to be able to buy this product because I think it is a product is definitely not sold in the US.

184
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,410
Speaker 0: I don't know where else.

185
00:12:48,492 --> 00:12:48,817
Speaker 0: it's old.

186
00:12:50,141 --> 00:13:02,048
Speaker 0: It's some sort of termite killing spray and here is a commercial presumably on television in Thailand for this termite killing spray and it is a Quite long for a commercial.

187
00:13:02,068 --> 00:13:03,734
Speaker 0: I got to know how long commercials are there.

188
00:13:03,854 --> 00:13:05,039
Speaker 1: Usually it's two minutes and 20 seconds.

189
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:10,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know 30 second spot, you know when you see the beginning you might think okay, that's why it's funny.

190
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:17,582
Speaker 1: but no the moment where you realize that this is a true work of art is Right.

191
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:20,532
Speaker 1: at a minute and 23 seconds.

192
00:13:20,572 --> 00:13:21,375
Speaker 0: watch the whole thing.

193
00:13:21,415 --> 00:13:25,180
Speaker 0: It doesn't get bad It just keeps getting better and better all the way through.

194
00:13:25,282 --> 00:13:26,339
Speaker 0: It's not like you know.

195
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:28,307
Speaker 0: That's the joke and you can stop watching.

196
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:31,780
Speaker 0: just watch the whole two minutes 20. don't buy the termite spray.

197
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,172
Speaker 0: Let's you got termites in which case call it help.

198
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:35,399
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's bad.

199
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:38,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, this commercial is magnificent.

200
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:39,464
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be.

201
00:13:39,805 --> 00:13:41,531
Speaker 0: I don't even know cuz I'm not.

202
00:13:41,832 --> 00:13:47,680
Speaker 0: this could be like a fake commercial someone made But it's so well done and highly produced, right?

203
00:13:48,001 --> 00:13:49,044
Speaker 0: I feel like I want to make.

204
00:13:49,405 --> 00:13:55,805
Speaker 0: someone should make a YouTube channel where they make ads this good for fake products And that would be.

205
00:13:55,945 --> 00:13:57,211
Speaker 0: this is basically like wait a minute.

206
00:13:57,231 --> 00:13:57,633
Speaker 1: Wait a minute.

207
00:13:57,874 --> 00:13:59,420
Speaker 1: I can think of one example of that already.

208
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:00,406
Speaker 0: It's basically a funny YouTube.

209
00:14:00,507 --> 00:14:02,580
Speaker 1: You may recall fuck you Baltimore.

210
00:14:04,104 --> 00:14:04,399
Speaker 0: anyway.

211
00:14:05,502 --> 00:14:06,589
Speaker 0: Yeah, watch this watch.

212
00:14:06,609 --> 00:14:07,273
Speaker 0: this ad is great.

213
00:14:08,058 --> 00:14:18,760
Speaker 1: So When I first got into anime I've told the story and gig nights before but it's very important that it was on the sci-fi channel when I was in fourth grade.

214
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:19,647
Speaker 1: They showed.

215
00:14:19,849 --> 00:14:20,453
Speaker 0: I mean I keep.

216
00:14:20,474 --> 00:14:21,240
Speaker 0: this keeps coming up.

217
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:23,990
Speaker 0: Everyone always wants to know like the first anime you saw.

218
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:30,700
Speaker 0: no one cares like the first book you read or the first movie You saw the first adult the first big boy book I ever read was the Hobbit.

219
00:14:31,001 --> 00:14:34,473
Speaker 0: I was really young right but the point is people seem to always want to know like.

220
00:14:34,513 --> 00:14:37,263
Speaker 0: the first anime you saw like you knew Was anime.

221
00:14:37,303 --> 00:14:39,192
Speaker 0: it's like I saw Voltron and shit.

222
00:14:39,252 --> 00:14:43,099
Speaker 0: and then I saw on TV as you know There was Dragon Ball and say there's all this shit on TV.

223
00:14:43,441 --> 00:14:44,064
Speaker 0: Yeah, like it's.

224
00:14:44,164 --> 00:14:44,988
Speaker 0: I can't tell you what.

225
00:14:45,008 --> 00:14:47,560
Speaker 0: the first anime as I was there was something on sci-fi channel.

226
00:14:48,368 --> 00:14:53,715
Speaker 1: See but I can because I may have seen things like Voltron vampire hunter D's.

227
00:14:53,918 --> 00:15:00,500
Speaker 1: but I got really into anime when I was in fourth grade, which was a long goddamn time ago.

228
00:15:00,902 --> 00:15:10,100
Speaker 1: So in middle school, and even like late elementary school I was the kid who was like into anime when literally no one else in my city had ever heard of anime.

229
00:15:11,065 --> 00:15:21,650
Speaker 1: So like I was getting VHS fan subs good times The first anime I saw as I've talked about a lot was a vampire hunter D Which is great because I was a little kid and that probably made me the way I am.

230
00:15:22,031 --> 00:15:29,518
Speaker 1: but the second anime I ever saw Was project a co because it was on television.

231
00:15:29,739 --> 00:15:31,423
Speaker 1: Yep The dub.

232
00:15:31,845 --> 00:15:35,920
Speaker 1: now at the time I was so young that while I thought project a co was funny.

233
00:15:36,522 --> 00:15:37,947
Speaker 1: I did not quite get that.

234
00:15:37,967 --> 00:15:39,312
Speaker 1: it was just a comedy.

235
00:15:39,412 --> 00:15:43,531
Speaker 1: I kind of treated it like it was a Serious superhero story.

236
00:15:43,551 --> 00:15:51,594
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but This YouTube video is the entirety of the original project a cause.

237
00:15:51,614 --> 00:15:52,998
Speaker 0: there's a legal YouTube video.

238
00:15:53,058 --> 00:15:54,986
Speaker 0: who even knows I don't think it is.

239
00:15:55,026 --> 00:15:55,529
Speaker 0: what channel?

240
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,460
Speaker 0: is it some lady?

241
00:15:57,980 --> 00:15:59,365
Speaker 1: Uploaded in 2016.

242
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:00,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, this seems not legitimate.

243
00:16:01,090 --> 00:16:02,173
Speaker 1: It's been up a while.

244
00:16:02,193 --> 00:16:04,280
Speaker 0: That's true, but it definitely seems not legitimate.

245
00:16:04,461 --> 00:16:13,457
Speaker 1: This is the exact dub the exact anime the second anime I ever saw pretty much in the format that I saw it complete with not the format.

246
00:16:13,497 --> 00:16:24,705
Speaker 1: I want to see it Yeah, so if I don't know I got weirdly Nostalgic hearing this dub like to up to a degree to where I feel like I'm gonna sit down and watch This whole YouTube video.

247
00:16:24,745 --> 00:16:25,909
Speaker 0: I'm not doing that this weekend.

248
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,418
Speaker 0: I'm gonna spend two minutes watching the cut the termite video again.

249
00:16:28,578 --> 00:16:28,779
Speaker 1: Yeah.

250
00:16:30,402 --> 00:16:43,300
Speaker 1: So in the moment the geek nights book club book The one we're about to read that I'm gonna post soon is a Dungeons & Dragons Planescape branded novel I read when I was young called pages of pain.

251
00:16:43,561 --> 00:16:52,415
Speaker 0: Yeah, my my subway read books on my phone plan continues once I finish the book I'm reading now, which is gonna be done in 20 minutes according to the Kindle app.

Speaker 0: No, I'm going to Acquire some painful digitally acquire some painful pages.

253
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:01,259
Speaker 0: So this book club will be done for me very soon.

254
00:17:01,621 --> 00:17:09,059
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless biking to work makes me read a lot less because most of the reading happens on the train I feel like it will not take us long to read this book.

255
00:17:09,561 --> 00:17:10,144
Speaker 0: We'll find out.

256
00:17:10,365 --> 00:17:13,839
Speaker 0: but you know, my my readings rate is like super high.

257
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,592
Speaker 0: I'm basically constantly reading book now for like a couple months.

258
00:17:17,154 --> 00:17:18,058
Speaker 0: It's been going strong.

259
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:20,978
Speaker 0: Yep I'm gonna continue it for as long as forever.

260
00:17:22,361 --> 00:17:24,920
Speaker 1: So beyond that we don't have any conventions for a while.

261
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:30,175
Speaker 1: but I recently uploaded to YouTube the rare game mechanics panel, which was a new one.

262
00:17:30,195 --> 00:17:37,357
Speaker 1: that we did at magfest is just on YouTube and Yesterday I uploaded the real harm of games another new panel.

263
00:17:37,377 --> 00:17:38,180
Speaker 1: We just did a PAX East.

264
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:43,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, I went to work editing the judge anime by its cover spring 2019 season.

265
00:17:44,621 --> 00:17:46,289
Speaker 0: There's some good anime coming up.

266
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,380
Speaker 0: almost completed the video editing.

267
00:17:48,501 --> 00:17:53,000
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll finish that tonight if I got nothing better to do and upload that biz.

268
00:17:54,004 --> 00:17:56,333
Speaker 1: Yeah, so good times ahead on the YouTube channel.

269
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:58,020
Speaker 1: Stay tuned for other YouTube content.

270
00:17:58,301 --> 00:18:02,660
Speaker 1: That is not just geek nights that we'll be cranking out now that we don't have to prepare for conventions for a while.

271
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:04,777
Speaker 1: So I figure we'll get right into it.

272
00:18:05,361 --> 00:18:09,239
Speaker 1: Adventure time we've talked about on geek nights before there's a forum thread about it.

273
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:13,040
Speaker 1: I actually try to figure out the first time or the last time we talked about it.

274
00:18:13,161 --> 00:18:15,140
Speaker 0: You know adventure time was a thing that you know.

275
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:31,111
Speaker 0: I couldn't escape seeing those characters everywhere right in nerd land at conventions at all kinds of places And I recognize them and I remember we watch the like original original original adventure time like Pilot thing when it was brand new right and I saw

276
00:18:31,171 --> 00:18:33,698
Speaker 1: I'm curious when do you think that was?

277
00:18:33,718 --> 00:18:34,580
Speaker 0: we were living in Beacon?

278
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,103
Speaker 1: I think yeah, you're correct.

279
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:46,344
Speaker 1: the original adventure time like the thing that became adventure time was made by Fred Rader and debuted on December 7th 2008

280
00:18:46,344 --> 00:18:59,618
Speaker 0: right so we watched that but I never made the connection between like that one shot pilot thing we watched and Like the Cartoon Network Show that became you know the thing right.

281
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:07,079
Speaker 1: in fact What was funny is I remember that adventure time was big in like the comic-con scene like I saw everywhere.

282
00:19:07,686 --> 00:19:16,099
Speaker 1: I saw art I saw people dressing up But I just kind of ignored it because it seemed like kind of a kids show and I didn't know a lot about it And I had a lot of other things to watch.

283
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:22,048
Speaker 0: I didn't really think about it, and then so basically a few seasons into adventure time Maybe like I don't know five or so.

284
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,392
Speaker 1: I can't know the exact moment.

285
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:25,460
Speaker 1: It was season three episode ten.

286
00:19:26,205 --> 00:19:26,891
Speaker 1: What was missing?

287
00:19:26,932 --> 00:19:27,839
Speaker 1: the one with the door Lord?

288
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,546
Speaker 1: okay, and the good music.

289
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:35,585
Speaker 1: that episode happened and Someone just randomly said oh my god You got to watch the show.

290
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:36,228
Speaker 1: like look at this.

291
00:19:36,448 --> 00:19:39,180
Speaker 1: and I ended up just seeing the song doesn't seem about right.

292
00:19:39,503 --> 00:19:40,876
Speaker 1: So I saw the songs they sang.

293
00:19:40,896 --> 00:19:45,560
Speaker 0: so this was Remember seeing that YouTube video of that song that was so good.

294
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:49,494
Speaker 1: Yep, that song is the reason I watched all of adventure time.

295
00:19:49,534 --> 00:19:51,100
Speaker 1: basically I saw that song.

296
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,088
Speaker 1: I was like whoa this show is not what I thought it was.

297
00:19:53,529 --> 00:19:54,774
Speaker 1: then I watched that whole episode.

298
00:19:54,794 --> 00:19:56,220
Speaker 1: whoa this show is great.

299
00:19:56,562 --> 00:20:01,711
Speaker 1: And then I just went to episode one and binge watched Everything I could find as fast as possible.

300
00:20:01,771 --> 00:20:03,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was I guess somewhere around that time.

301
00:20:03,981 --> 00:20:18,640
Speaker 0: I went to episode one watched it all the caught up Yeah, and then watched episodes kind of mostly as they came out as I could get them until Sometime around like one or two seasons before the show ended maybe like, you know, the the vampire stakes part.

302
00:20:18,862 --> 00:20:19,689
Speaker 0: I've watched all of that.

303
00:20:19,709 --> 00:20:20,960
Speaker 1: I just kept watching every.

304
00:20:22,424 --> 00:20:28,762
Speaker 0: I watched some more episodes after that and then they announced that it was gonna end and I hadn't watched in a little in a few Months.

305
00:20:28,822 --> 00:20:32,360
Speaker 0: I like it and not kept up on it just out of laziness or doing other stuff.

306
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:34,508
Speaker 0: So I said, oh you say the show's gonna end.

307
00:20:34,869 --> 00:20:37,780
Speaker 0: All right, I'm just gonna hold off then and let you finish.

308
00:20:37,981 --> 00:20:38,767
Speaker 0: I'm gonna let you finish.

309
00:20:38,788 --> 00:20:42,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then I figured okay I'll figure out where I left off and catch up.

310
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:46,316
Speaker 0: But then what ended up happening instead is Maybe a month or so ago.

311
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:49,579
Speaker 0: You know Amanda hadn't seen any Avenger time.

312
00:20:50,062 --> 00:20:52,451
Speaker 0: So I just went back to the beginning and it already ended.

313
00:20:52,692 --> 00:20:53,877
Speaker 0: so I went just from beginning to end.

314
00:20:53,917 --> 00:20:59,568
Speaker 0: like whoosh Adventure time is in the heart To the end than I thought when I when I stopped.

315
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:05,529
Speaker 1: it's kind of like cowboy bebop in the sense that if I start watching Any part of that show?

316
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:07,200
Speaker 1: I'll probably just keep watch.

317
00:21:07,521 --> 00:21:09,188
Speaker 0: The episodes are 50 are short.

318
00:21:09,248 --> 00:21:09,730
Speaker 0: right because it's.

319
00:21:09,830 --> 00:21:17,053
Speaker 0: it's like a you know, it's almost like a Looney Tunes situation Have a 30-minute TV block with two episodes in it.

320
00:21:17,414 --> 00:21:17,816
Speaker 0: So they could.

321
00:21:17,836 --> 00:21:18,820
Speaker 0: they go bam bam.

322
00:21:18,961 --> 00:21:28,199
Speaker 0: It's not like you're you know There's no time for you to like get tired or bored and then like if you set it up when if you pirating it or Streaming it or whatever Depending on how you set up your video.

323
00:21:28,801 --> 00:21:40,380
Speaker 0: like you're gonna load your videos in and we push play in VLC and it just goes and goes and goes and goes and just Doesn't let go of your attention which makes it a great television show to trap kids in front of the TV watching ads.

324
00:21:40,681 --> 00:21:46,160
Speaker 0: So five years ago in May so almost especially when there's no ads you really get trapped by it.

325
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:52,974
Speaker 1: Yeah, almost exactly five years ago We did a show about adventure time and how it was still ongoing.

326
00:21:53,034 --> 00:21:55,242
Speaker 1: and just talking about it at that point Mm-hmm.

327
00:21:55,543 --> 00:21:58,880
Speaker 1: and funnily enough, you know who is on the show is one of our guests Judith.

328
00:21:59,221 --> 00:22:00,746
Speaker 1: Okay, who is just so I guess.

329
00:22:01,087 --> 00:22:03,695
Speaker 1: every five years Judith will be on geek nights.

330
00:22:04,057 --> 00:22:09,031
Speaker 0: All right, Judith get ready 2024 here on this here on the hook.

331
00:22:09,131 --> 00:22:14,670
Speaker 1: Yep, and in 2014 Also we in April.

332
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:22,955
Speaker 1: so like almost exactly exactly five years ago We talked about the Masaaki Yuasa episode of Adventure Time.

333
00:22:23,156 --> 00:22:28,516
Speaker 1: Mmm, which itself was was Exactly what you might expect it today.

334
00:22:28,738 --> 00:22:31,950
Speaker 0: Yeah And I also found that no bearing on the plot though.

335
00:22:31,990 --> 00:22:32,793
Speaker 0: You can skip it.

336
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:35,060
Speaker 1: But yeah, that's it's not canon, right?

337
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,787
Speaker 0: But that's the thing about Adventure Time.

338
00:22:36,927 --> 00:22:40,340
Speaker 0: Is that in addition to its story and characters?

339
00:22:40,481 --> 00:22:42,313
Speaker 0: Which are like the number one reasons to watch it?

340
00:22:42,373 --> 00:22:47,490
Speaker 0: right story character The epic plot and the amazing characters and the music right?

341
00:22:47,831 --> 00:22:51,340
Speaker 0: is that also because there's so many episodes over such a breath of time?

342
00:22:52,821 --> 00:23:01,188
Speaker 0: You know, it was an avenue for lots of you know, kooky pop art Experimental art lots of different styles.

343
00:23:01,248 --> 00:23:10,944
Speaker 0: It wasn't just like, you know watching My Little Pony where every episode is drawn The same way by the same people by the same, you know, you know studio machine Right is.

344
00:23:10,964 --> 00:23:21,120
Speaker 0: there was lots of like, you know, crazy offshoot episodes that have nothing to do with nothing But are just like this creative outlet for somebody here and there right like there was a. it was some CG one.

345
00:23:21,362 --> 00:23:22,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything was all glitched out.

346
00:23:23,101 --> 00:23:29,063
Speaker 1: Best part of that episode is when the princesses just looking shit and she just pulls out that gun and tries to shoot him Right.

347
00:23:29,083 --> 00:23:35,434
Speaker 0: It wasn't just the Yuasa one There was the you know, there was all the episodes with Fiona and Kay, yeah, which are right.

348
00:23:35,474 --> 00:23:43,697
Speaker 1: there were the which ended up becoming Canon in quotes sort of well because they're there they are a fictional work within that universe right.

349
00:23:43,977 --> 00:23:49,817
Speaker 0: and then there's the Greville's Right, which you know are just sort of like little episodic dealies.

350
00:23:49,980 --> 00:24:03,524
Speaker 1: but I guess the important part about all that biz is that even though each episode is very self-contained and very fond and Doesn't like they kind of mostly self-contained well toward the arm are some are toward the end of the show They started having long arcs.

351
00:24:03,784 --> 00:24:03,965
Speaker 0: Yeah.

352
00:24:04,306 --> 00:24:08,738
Speaker 0: Well, so I mean episodes were largely self-contained except for there's a couple.

353
00:24:08,798 --> 00:24:09,896
Speaker 0: two-part is here And yeah.

354
00:24:10,261 --> 00:24:21,779
Speaker 1: But every episode the little bits in the background of like things characters do and things people say and like little off-end Comments, they all build up to the final full story.

355
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:25,220
Speaker 0: Well, but I mean there's also some where it's like yeah, it's a self-contained episode.

356
00:24:25,341 --> 00:24:43,118
Speaker 0: But if you didn't know for example that like king of who is currently in charge You know during this set of episodes and it's like that's just like the state of the world changes Yeah, and that might throw you off guard if you had missed The episode where the state of the world changed like Princess Bubblegum becomes young.

357
00:24:43,158 --> 00:24:49,920
Speaker 0: at one point It's actually much earlier in the show than I remember and also very much more brief than I remember that happening.

358
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:56,030
Speaker 0: It was very short But like if you were to watch one of those like handful episodes where she's young and just like wait Why the fuck is she young right?

359
00:24:56,050 --> 00:24:57,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's just like okay.

360
00:24:57,340 --> 00:25:01,819
Speaker 1: Of course at the same time with adventure time if something weird is in the universe you kind of just go, huh?

361
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:02,803
Speaker 0: All right.

362
00:25:03,026 --> 00:25:04,179
Speaker 0: Yep, just roll with it.

363
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:10,140
Speaker 0: But you know and it's you know, much like actually a lot of anime, you know, it has this long continuing plot.

364
00:25:10,241 --> 00:25:13,299
Speaker 0: It doesn't really repeat stuff or hold your hand very much.

365
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:16,713
Speaker 0: So, you know, they're just like throwing out names of stuff.

366
00:25:16,753 --> 00:25:20,346
Speaker 0: and if you don't know you don't know yeah, you could get lost.

367
00:25:20,707 --> 00:25:22,493
Speaker 0: and I you know, I don't.

368
00:25:22,693 --> 00:25:24,379
Speaker 0: I don't have the experience of being lost cuz.

369
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:30,349
Speaker 0: I watched It from beginning to end straight every time I watched it But I could imagine how you could get lost cuz.

370
00:25:30,449 --> 00:25:37,880
Speaker 0: even then I there were some things where I had to like roll back Go to Wikipedia make sure my remember what I remember that kind of thing.

371
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,320
Speaker 0: So if I was watching them randomly on TV, it would have been way worse, especially if I miss them.

372
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,600
Speaker 1: Oh god, so one last very important warning about adventure time and we'll save spoilers for a bit.

373
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:51,180
Speaker 1: We're just gonna do like a full-on review because it's it's such an important and long-running show.

374
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:55,240
Speaker 1: but In 2013 we talked about something bad.

375
00:25:56,161 --> 00:26:03,916
Speaker 1: There were some adventure time video games and I just need to impress upon you They are utter garbage or adventure time comics.

376
00:26:04,237 --> 00:26:04,940
Speaker 0: They're great.

377
00:26:05,221 --> 00:26:05,823
Speaker 0: Well, I've only.

378
00:26:05,843 --> 00:26:07,108
Speaker 0: I have a whole bunch of them.

379
00:26:07,128 --> 00:26:08,213
Speaker 1: the ones I've read were great.

380
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:10,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't read that many of them.

381
00:26:10,221 --> 00:26:14,940
Speaker 0: I probably should but they actually did a thing which has been done successfully in the past.

382
00:26:15,020 --> 00:26:19,599
Speaker 0: I don't know people know this but I don't know how many seasons of Buffy the Vampire Slayer there were on TV.

383
00:26:20,242 --> 00:26:32,860
Speaker 0: But they basically continued the TV show of Buffy the Vampire Slayer in comic book form and they actually comics were like season Whatever season whatever like as if they were writing more of the TV show just straight up and I pretty sure it's just canon.

384
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:42,944
Speaker 0: They continued the show but because they didn't have a TV deal our actors or anything They just continued it in comics same just right from where the TV show left off adventure time I was.

385
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:47,890
Speaker 0: they've done this with other things too, but Buffy's probably the only the most successful example.

386
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:49,960
Speaker 0: They tried to do the same thing with adventure time.

387
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:51,004
Speaker 0: They were like adventure time.

388
00:26:51,406 --> 00:26:54,919
Speaker 0: season 11 is the would be the next one, right?

389
00:26:55,641 --> 00:26:58,759
Speaker 0: There were ten seasons of adventure time depending on how you count.

390
00:26:59,703 --> 00:27:02,413
Speaker 0: Anyway, I think they called it season 11 or 12.

391
00:27:02,413 --> 00:27:03,096
Speaker 0: I don't know.

392
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:04,634
Speaker 0: It's it's 10 11 or 12 I don't know.

393
00:27:04,961 --> 00:27:07,068
Speaker 0: but they basically like adventure time comics.

394
00:27:07,329 --> 00:27:13,884
Speaker 0: season 11 just continued where the show left off in comic form and Then it was abruptly Surprisingly cancelled.

395
00:27:13,924 --> 00:27:17,619
Speaker 0: apparently no one was buying it which I was like, hey, you didn't even put out the trade.

396
00:27:17,659 --> 00:27:18,867
Speaker 0: yet I'm gonna buy the trade.

397
00:27:18,927 --> 00:27:20,719
Speaker 0: then how do you know how not popular it's gonna be?

398
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,980
Speaker 0: Yeah I assume they'll put out a trade because they didn't put out some issues.

399
00:27:24,422 --> 00:27:33,844
Speaker 0: So I will get the trade of the issues that were made which I'm sure will come at some point And I'll see what the deal was with the continuing I guess effect.

400
00:27:33,965 --> 00:27:36,635
Speaker 0: effectively cannon next season of adventure time.

401
00:27:36,656 --> 00:27:37,599
Speaker 0: that just wasn't on TV.

402
00:27:38,081 --> 00:27:39,104
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was only a comic book.

403
00:27:39,124 --> 00:27:49,140
Speaker 1: but I cannot stress enough the adventure time games unlike the 3ds than the DS are in no Universe worth playing just about anything with adventure time branding on it.

404
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,747
Speaker 0: That isn't say high quality merchandise.

405
00:27:52,228 --> 00:27:53,150
Speaker 0: the show itself.

406
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:54,413
Speaker 1: Yeah, or the comics.

407
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:59,446
Speaker 0: the comic some of the comics maybe most of them Is something that's not good.

408
00:27:59,767 --> 00:28:01,592
Speaker 1: Yeah, like it is that game.

409
00:28:01,732 --> 00:28:04,860
Speaker 1: Why did you steal our garbage is egregiously bad?

410
00:28:05,001 --> 00:28:08,220
Speaker 1: I just remembered how bad it was because we spent time talking about how bad it was.

411
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,989
Speaker 0: You know the balloons tower defense game that I play.

412
00:28:11,069 --> 00:28:22,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, there is an adventure time balloons tower defense, which is basically Same game with adventure time same game only more more microtransaction II and worse but with lots of adventure time theming on it.

413
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:28,314
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I think adventure time is going to be one of the like.

414
00:28:28,375 --> 00:28:30,060
Speaker 1: it is going to be a legendary show.

415
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:31,105
Speaker 0: It is it is.

416
00:28:31,165 --> 00:28:33,054
Speaker 1: Yes, it will stand the test of time.

417
00:28:33,074 --> 00:28:34,200
Speaker 1: It is an important show.

418
00:28:34,361 --> 00:28:37,920
Speaker 0: I sort of put it there with like a fist of the North Star or a Sailor Moon.

419
00:28:38,302 --> 00:28:41,200
Speaker 0: It's like a show that's got like a shit pile of episodes, but not anything.

420
00:28:41,421 --> 00:28:41,541
Speaker 0: It's.

421
00:28:41,843 --> 00:28:44,855
Speaker 0: it's a lot but it's not some insane amount that you can't watch.

422
00:28:44,895 --> 00:28:47,285
Speaker 1: not one piece It's Sailor Moon right.

423
00:28:47,405 --> 00:28:49,031
Speaker 0: one piece is too insane and too big.

424
00:28:49,051 --> 00:28:51,540
Speaker 0: You can't watch it, even though it's probably equally legendary.

425
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:52,785
Speaker 0: I mean like.

426
00:28:52,865 --> 00:28:56,500
Speaker 0: there's 283. most legendary shows are 26 episodes or less.

427
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:04,420
Speaker 1: There are 283 episodes of adventure time and because they're short that is less Time than watching Sailor Moon.

428
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:12,858
Speaker 0: It's definitely consumable, but still long and epic and big.

429
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:17,658
Speaker 1: But the thing that I think is the most important about adventure time the two things.

430
00:29:17,678 --> 00:29:20,226
Speaker 1: there are two things I think that really make the show important.

431
00:29:20,426 --> 00:29:26,102
Speaker 1: one it used music really well, and I do credit it as Well in there.

432
00:29:26,162 --> 00:29:31,680
Speaker 0: in there ending they were like, you know leaning on the music hard as like, you know, they're their deal.

433
00:29:32,021 --> 00:29:32,684
Speaker 1: I mean the music.

434
00:29:32,724 --> 00:29:36,660
Speaker 1: like we said the music is what got me to watch the show in the first place.

435
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:37,997
Speaker 0: That's partially true Yes.

436
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:45,845
Speaker 1: and two I credit adventure time as one of the things that caused a lot of kids cartoons or Cartoons like this to start to.

437
00:29:45,926 --> 00:29:48,314
Speaker 1: also I mean ponies lean heavily into the music.

438
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:50,140
Speaker 1: Steven Universe leaned into the music.

439
00:29:50,762 --> 00:29:55,217
Speaker 1: I do think adventure time is a big part of that trend and I approve of that trend.

440
00:29:55,297 --> 00:29:55,899
Speaker 0: I agree as well.

441
00:29:56,863 --> 00:30:08,049
Speaker 1: Also, the second thing is that the sheer scope not of the story adventure time though It is big but the scope of what the show was like season by season episode by episode.

442
00:30:08,069 --> 00:30:18,000
Speaker 1: you almost don't notice it if you just watch it sequentially, but The show goes in a lot of different directions and covers a lot of surprising grounds, right?

443
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:25,340
Speaker 0: Well, I think part of what it is is because the show went on so long and had a continuous plot Even if it wasn't necessarily perfectly serial.

444
00:30:25,466 --> 00:30:26,202
Speaker 0: Yeah Is that?

445
00:30:26,442 --> 00:30:28,488
Speaker 0: it was on Cartoon Network aimed at children.

446
00:30:28,508 --> 00:30:32,038
Speaker 0: is that the children watching the show from the beginning were?

447
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,470
Speaker 0: Like 10 plus years older when the show ended?

448
00:30:36,550 --> 00:30:41,220
Speaker 1: like they were kids were about Finn's age watching the show So it aged in real time.

449
00:30:42,805 --> 00:30:52,742
Speaker 0: So unlike some sort of episodic thing like say a Looney Tune where you know You watch it when you're young and then it's episodic so you can just sort of grow out of it and move on to something Else.

450
00:30:53,123 --> 00:30:56,940
Speaker 0: right you were sticking with adventure time as you grew up and it grew up with you.

451
00:30:57,001 --> 00:31:07,957
Speaker 0: So even though I was already growing up when I started It's plain to see how a generation a certain generation grew up with adventure time side by side grew up.

452
00:31:08,862 --> 00:31:14,139
Speaker 0: The show didn't did not attempt to like stay and it's like keep aiming at.

453
00:31:14,219 --> 00:31:17,770
Speaker 0: you know The original age group that it was aimed at.

454
00:31:18,131 --> 00:31:20,138
Speaker 0: it grew along and it said okay.

455
00:31:20,218 --> 00:31:20,920
Speaker 0: It's a year later.

456
00:31:21,141 --> 00:31:22,910
Speaker 0: We started with a show for 10 year olds.

457
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:24,358
Speaker 0: now, we're a show for 11 year olds.

458
00:31:24,378 --> 00:31:27,060
Speaker 0: the next year They're like, okay now we're a show for 12 year olds or whatever.

459
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:30,717
Speaker 1: It was what I'd always been kind of hoping would happen, but I'm good.

460
00:31:30,737 --> 00:31:31,380
Speaker 1: It's probably fine.

461
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,459
Speaker 1: They didn't cuz the ending was great.

462
00:31:32,901 --> 00:31:40,623
Speaker 1: But I was kind of hoping the show would just keep going and then like 30 years or no Finn's just 40 Like I would.

463
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:44,119
Speaker 1: I would have kept watching if they did that but not to spoil yet.

464
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:46,671
Speaker 1: But the ending was perfect and I cannot.

465
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,680
Speaker 0: it was a excellent ending.

466
00:31:49,061 --> 00:31:54,660
Speaker 0: But the thing was I feel like the the lead up to the ending could have could have been a little stretched out.

467
00:31:55,383 --> 00:32:07,240
Speaker 1: The episode the the series the little arcs they used to lead up to the ending felt a little rush Like yes stakes and all those stories elements that they did before the end Like they all should have been about twice as long.

468
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:20,760
Speaker 0: That's the only come right because the main plot is over the course of so is is over such a long period of time and like that feels like the pace of the show like Introduce the Lich season or two later fight the Lich, right?

469
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:21,442
Speaker 0: It's like that.

470
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:25,655
Speaker 0: make the epicness of stretching those those lines out, right?

471
00:32:25,835 --> 00:32:26,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, is then at the end.

472
00:32:26,979 --> 00:32:33,468
Speaker 0: It's like introduced the evil gum family And it's like a few elements.

473
00:32:33,628 --> 00:32:33,889
Speaker 1: Okay.

474
00:32:33,930 --> 00:32:36,640
Speaker 1: Now we dealt with the elements into like it's just like bam bam bam.

475
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:41,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, they knew they had to end the show because there was a physical to like money deadline.

476
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:41,925
Speaker 1: Do you finish?

477
00:32:41,945 --> 00:32:44,620
Speaker 0: the show accelerates in the last season or two?

478
00:32:45,445 --> 00:32:47,600
Speaker 0: Quite dramatically and that's you know.

479
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:55,147
Speaker 0: It takes away a little bit from the epicness that the rest of the show prior to then islands I think was this had a good pace.

480
00:32:55,388 --> 00:33:05,941
Speaker 0: Islands was definitely after Islands is when the pace got too fast yep, but also I place of the placing and pacing of the islands part was like perfect and after that is when things got a Little.

481
00:33:06,342 --> 00:33:08,088
Speaker 1: I really like the islands part.

482
00:33:08,390 --> 00:33:10,136
Speaker 1: I think all the like mini arts.

483
00:33:10,176 --> 00:33:14,669
Speaker 1: That's probably the best one Stakes if it had been a little longer because I like how.

484
00:33:14,749 --> 00:33:16,695
Speaker 1: I like the real talk that happened in stakes.

485
00:33:17,076 --> 00:33:27,439
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but uh the show just went on for so long and it ended and It was kind of a loss for a show that I had watched for so long to end.

486
00:33:27,781 --> 00:33:28,083
Speaker 0: I can't.

487
00:33:28,103 --> 00:33:28,727
Speaker 0: yeah it is.

488
00:33:29,009 --> 00:33:34,314
Speaker 0: but on the other hand, I kind of like it when stuff I mean, I mean, I like endings as endings are epic and awesome, but I guess there's.

489
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:35,920
Speaker 0: no I can always rewatch it.

490
00:33:36,083 --> 00:33:36,739
Speaker 1: There's a visceral.

491
00:33:37,563 --> 00:33:39,460
Speaker 0: I'll get more out of it if I watch it again and again.

492
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:44,740
Speaker 1: There's a visceral difference between a show that had aired and finished before I watched like Sailor Moon.

493
00:33:44,921 --> 00:33:49,960
Speaker 1: I was just like I'm a watch all the Sailor Moon this weekend and I watched all the Sailor Moon in one weekend.

494
00:33:50,221 --> 00:33:53,819
Speaker 1: Well, I'm starting with s because I'd already seen up through our hookup.

495
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:58,460
Speaker 1: So we watch s super s stars over the course of a ridiculous three-day weekend.

496
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:00,680
Speaker 1: That was all those in high school.

497
00:34:00,841 --> 00:34:04,939
Speaker 0: The point is ending is good because it frees me up to get something else.

498
00:34:05,662 --> 00:34:10,159
Speaker 1: But I was pretty much once I saw that what was missing episode?

499
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,793
Speaker 1: I just watched Adventure Time as it came out like all the way to the end.

500
00:34:13,833 --> 00:34:14,416
Speaker 1: I never stopped.

501
00:34:14,837 --> 00:34:15,560
Speaker 1: I never paused.

502
00:34:16,502 --> 00:34:25,702
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into how the season numbers were all fucked up Depending on if you watch them like Amazon or like the numbers don't matter as long as you're watching all the episodes in the right Order, I think.

503
00:34:25,742 --> 00:35:03,846
Speaker 1: what happened though, like it's interesting that Adventure Time as a show spanned the Like the television era the early internet era and the current internet era of how you get TV shows Which is part of the reason why I think the end got a little rushed and like it was like it was hard to watch Unless you had TV like the show spanned three distinct eras of the monetization of television shows And that is that is an interesting thing that I'm sure will be studied in universities in years to come Because there aren't many shows that have done that.

504
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:11,520
Speaker 0: yeah, even though other shows like say Flintstones went on for a long I'm pretty sure it went on for longer than Avenger the world of TV didn't change.

505
00:35:11,580 --> 00:35:14,469
Speaker 1: It was just like ad supported broadcast television, right?

506
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:17,920
Speaker 0: But you know if you want to look for examples, I mean you can't beat Simpson

507
00:35:18,543 --> 00:35:18,865
Speaker 1: Yeah,

508
00:35:19,327 --> 00:35:22,362
Speaker 0: or even South Park right is still bigger than you know but

509
00:35:22,402 --> 00:35:30,900
Speaker 1: the Simpsons went from traditional show with traditional format to Still a traditional show with the traditional format still supported by ads on like Hulu.

510
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:34,555
Speaker 1: Adventure time like started as a Frederator.

511
00:35:34,596 --> 00:35:35,479
Speaker 1: Let's make something cool.

512
00:35:35,961 --> 00:35:47,756
Speaker 1: Became a non-traditional television show that then had to be monetized in a non-traditional way instead of just becoming a Hulu show Like it's a. it was in a weird situation as a result.

513
00:35:48,037 --> 00:35:51,309
Speaker 1: Mmm It also had an a-plus voice cast like.

514
00:35:51,329 --> 00:35:52,212
Speaker 1: the writing was great.

515
00:35:52,292 --> 00:35:53,436
Speaker 1: Everything about the show was great.

516
00:35:53,456 --> 00:35:55,680
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I say best this point.

517
00:35:55,720 --> 00:36:01,600
Speaker 1: We're gonna assume you saw the show all the way to the end so we can talk about specific moments specific things the end itself.

518
00:36:02,061 --> 00:36:13,880
Speaker 0: So well the number one crime in all adventure time that spoilers have upset me very greatly Is that having watched all of it every single episode very recently fresh in the mind, right?

519
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:25,027
Speaker 0: my favorite character choose goose does not appear as often nearly as much as Deserved right And that is a crime against humanity.

520
00:36:25,147 --> 00:36:26,954
Speaker 0: I demand the choose goose spin-off.

521
00:36:26,974 --> 00:36:27,496
Speaker 0: That is all.

522
00:36:27,536 --> 00:36:27,958
Speaker 0: choose goose.

523
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:31,623
Speaker 1: all the time I would watch that I Would a hundred.

524
00:36:31,663 --> 00:36:37,690
Speaker 0: normally when people ask for that stuff like I want cowgirl at nine It's like no, let's not go there.

525
00:36:37,951 --> 00:36:39,398
Speaker 0: But no, I want choose goose.

526
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,620
Speaker 0: Yep Give me all the choose goose you got.

527
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:55,690
Speaker 1: But in terms of like the ending in the story in the plot The show was primarily about the characters and the world building happening around them was just interesting and then bit by bit It started to morph into.

528
00:36:56,012 --> 00:37:19,855
Speaker 1: let's actually follow this plot And if I and I think I like the fact that the plot itself ended up being a sort of Lovecraftian like there is a terrible secret of space and earth is a tiny speck with tiny humans and the cosmic scale of nonsense and the people in Adventure Time Interact with that cosmic nonsense in the way that tiny people on a tiny planet.

529
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:21,659
Speaker 1: could I like that?

530
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,712
Speaker 1: Well, there's gods out there and civilizations on Mars.

531
00:37:25,813 --> 00:37:27,860
Speaker 0: Well, it's a lot like a Marvel Universe situation.

532
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:30,467
Speaker 0: Yeah, you watch you you read me Marvel Comics, right?

533
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:35,220
Speaker 0: And it's like, okay, you've got real small level stories, right?

534
00:37:35,300 --> 00:37:41,160
Speaker 0: You know, it's like a single superhero dealing with their bullshit like, you know, spider-man having problems in high school.

535
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:42,409
Speaker 1: Then you got your New York story.

536
00:37:44,060 --> 00:37:48,378
Speaker 0: So in Adventure Time, that would be like the ooh level story like something is threatening ooh, right?

537
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,229
Speaker 0: The land of ooh, there's trouble in ooh, right?

538
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:53,820
Speaker 0: Then you've got like bigger stuff, right?

539
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:56,695
Speaker 0: Okay, Magneto is threatening the earth, right?

540
00:37:56,775 --> 00:37:57,600
Speaker 0: Something is happening.

541
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:02,033
Speaker 0: That's threatening the Ice Kingdom and the Candy Kingdom and the Fire Kingdom and right?

542
00:38:02,113 --> 00:38:09,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, something bigger is threatening the whole planet Right, then you got your cosmic, you know infinity gauntlet shit with.

543
00:38:09,159 --> 00:38:13,980
Speaker 0: you know You're Lich and you're glob and you're king of Mars and you're all that kind of stuff.

544
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:21,760
Speaker 0: Yeah, right and he's like you're telling stories and all the levels right of epicness that weave in and out of each other.

545
00:38:22,121 --> 00:38:26,540
Speaker 0: The same care, but you know your main characters are always the focus, right?

546
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:30,111
Speaker 0: So even though you know infinity gauntlet Marvel Comics, guess what?

547
00:38:30,151 --> 00:38:32,780
Speaker 0: There's Captain American spider-man right there at the front.

548
00:38:33,502 --> 00:38:37,738
Speaker 0: That's that stupid high school kid is dealing with like, you know, the right.

549
00:38:37,758 --> 00:38:44,360
Speaker 0: and there it is There's stupid Finn that kid who lives in a tree dealing with gob and glob, right?

550
00:38:44,921 --> 00:38:49,703
Speaker 1: The god of the solar system basically just started as they wanted to say oh my god But as a kid show.

551
00:38:49,723 --> 00:38:54,220
Speaker 1: so they would say stuff instead of poop and they would say so glob instead of God.

552
00:38:54,501 --> 00:38:58,575
Speaker 0: It's interesting because you having watched the whole thing recently again.

553
00:38:58,595 --> 00:38:59,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll keep bringing that up.

554
00:39:00,664 --> 00:39:06,380
Speaker 0: You know, I've heard some people say in the best Oh the first season of adventure time has like a different feel right?

555
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:08,587
Speaker 0: It doesn't get epic in story things.

556
00:39:08,688 --> 00:39:09,691
Speaker 1: It's all there though.

557
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:11,517
Speaker 0: No, everything is there from the beginning.

558
00:39:11,537 --> 00:39:12,440
Speaker 0: That's complete horseshit.

559
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:17,220
Speaker 1: The only question is some of it was might have been throwaway things that were just jokes.

560
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:18,967
Speaker 1: Right that they went back in mine.

561
00:39:18,987 --> 00:39:19,028
Speaker 1: It

562
00:39:19,108 --> 00:39:40,633
Speaker 0: is hard to tell and without interviewing someone Which it's probably a mixture right which things were planned and written from the beginning to the end and which things were simply Masterfully taken from older episodes by writers and then given new life and meaning in later episodes Like oh, yeah, that was that one off character.

563
00:39:40,693 --> 00:39:41,680
Speaker 0: You just wrote into that scene.

564
00:39:42,021 --> 00:39:45,430
Speaker 0: Well now I've written a whole episode about that character and it looked.

565
00:39:45,670 --> 00:39:51,443
Speaker 0: if you watch you it feels like that was done on purpose right You know.

566
00:39:51,524 --> 00:39:57,140
Speaker 0: and it's like almost the whole the hope the main plot is like yeah They're on this land of who which is a post-apocalyptic earth.

567
00:39:57,461 --> 00:39:58,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, right we're.

568
00:39:58,043 --> 00:40:08,380
Speaker 0: in the past was a society similar to ours with cars and buildings and planes And I love all the just little hints about this over the course, but it's like in episode one in the intro.

569
00:40:08,523 --> 00:40:12,735
Speaker 0: It's like yeah there's like busted up modern job just like in the woods.

570
00:40:13,157 --> 00:40:22,060
Speaker 0: and it's like did they just draw busted up modern junk in the woods by accident and then Decide the course of the whole plot based on that or no, it was on purpose, right?

571
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:29,878
Speaker 0: You know and they were wise enough to drop that stuff, you know and leave it everywhere Even when it wasn't the focus cuz it was rarely the focus.

572
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:30,200
Speaker 1: Yep.

573
00:40:30,561 --> 00:40:38,428
Speaker 1: But also I like the fact that the Lich was effectively a Cthulhu like the priest of Some great cosmic evil.

574
00:40:38,689 --> 00:40:41,400
Speaker 1: Yep, like that worked really well.

575
00:40:41,821 --> 00:40:47,359
Speaker 1: I especially like how magic man and Marga magic man comes back and just like yeah, we talked up.

576
00:40:48,063 --> 00:40:49,129
Speaker 1: And then Galba Pierce.

577
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:54,973
Speaker 0: Well, I wish that they had You know, that's that's part of it the ending that with the Russian ish.

578
00:40:55,073 --> 00:40:58,951
Speaker 0: Yeah, is that they didn't spend the time To you know, it's like, okay.

579
00:40:58,971 --> 00:41:01,363
Speaker 0: I know all the terrible secret to space I'm gonna know.

580
00:41:01,384 --> 00:41:06,863
Speaker 0: but you know, I really like to see all the details like what exactly What exactly happened.

581
00:41:06,884 --> 00:41:16,270
Speaker 1: the show pulled an Evangelion on you for that because the actual end of the show is BMO the new king of ooh There's that moment where the kid the new character is like.

582
00:41:16,672 --> 00:41:17,516
Speaker 1: so what happened then?

583
00:41:17,676 --> 00:41:20,850
Speaker 1: and he's like They kept living their lives.

584
00:41:20,870 --> 00:41:21,413
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

585
00:41:21,755 --> 00:41:22,137
Speaker 1: Thank you.

586
00:41:22,378 --> 00:41:24,317
Speaker 1: Goodbye Leave my house.

587
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:33,760
Speaker 1: Like the whole point is that a long-running show has to end and Stories don't have to end at like the end of time or the end of the universe.

588
00:41:34,142 --> 00:41:37,237
Speaker 1: You don't need the show that takes you through the next 80 years of like.

589
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:41,031
Speaker 0: no No, I'm not but I'm saying the part that you did cover right?

590
00:41:41,211 --> 00:41:47,092
Speaker 0: It's like you didn't show me what Matt what normal man and You know Betty and you know the witch did.

591
00:41:47,253 --> 00:41:48,780
Speaker 0: yeah, how did they dunk that up?

592
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:56,019
Speaker 1: I I'm glad we didn't see it because I want to hear that they cut like when Jake farts Funnier when they come in and they're like, yeah, we fucked up.

593
00:41:56,260 --> 00:42:03,329
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that was right it was it was a funny joke But you could have still you know, especially cuz Maja wakes up and then just recently It's like cuz.

594
00:42:03,369 --> 00:42:09,379
Speaker 0: I really did care about Gob gob gob ground who's I guess still a bunch of heads floating in around the planet.

595
00:42:10,202 --> 00:42:11,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, I cared about them a lot.

596
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:12,975
Speaker 1: Well, I'm on a wiki here every reference.

597
00:42:14,361 --> 00:42:19,880
Speaker 0: I really wanted to know their deal, but we really didn't get too much about gold.

598
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:22,260
Speaker 0: It was just sort of like oh, yeah gold big bad guy.

599
00:42:23,381 --> 00:42:26,957
Speaker 0: So and then we didn't learn enough to make me care enough about gold.

600
00:42:26,997 --> 00:42:27,680
Speaker 1: I think we know enough.

601
00:42:27,700 --> 00:42:28,443
Speaker 0: You know what gobb is?

602
00:42:28,523 --> 00:42:31,375
Speaker 1: Well, all we need to know he is a cosmic evil.

603
00:42:31,395 --> 00:42:35,869
Speaker 0: Yeah beyond Comprehension even even worse than or galore like.

604
00:42:36,049 --> 00:42:38,017
Speaker 1: do not like don't just hope.

605
00:42:38,057 --> 00:42:38,800
Speaker 1: it never looks at you.

606
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,008
Speaker 1: It's like a black hole coming.

607
00:42:41,169 --> 00:42:46,647
Speaker 0: I'm aware of that but it's like a really, you know, so the first You know where gold first appears?

608
00:42:46,667 --> 00:42:49,660
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm in the episode where Finn becomes a pillow?

609
00:42:51,241 --> 00:43:00,070
Speaker 1: Gold is in that episode where when Finn dies in pillow world and remember there's the scene where he like Warps through space-time back to his body.

610
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:00,752
Speaker 0: No guy.

611
00:43:01,054 --> 00:43:02,479
Speaker 1: He passes gold.

612
00:43:03,483 --> 00:43:05,170
Speaker 1: Aha, they put him there.

613
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,700
Speaker 1: He actually bounces off of gold move.

614
00:43:07,981 --> 00:43:13,899
Speaker 1: So Finn coming back from that universe might be what attracted gulps attention back to earth.

615
00:43:14,481 --> 00:43:30,672
Speaker 1: Maybe he's mentioned again in the magic one of the magic man episodes where betty betty I'm reading from the wiki here betty witnesses a memory of him and Grob gob glob Grod Discussing gobb at some point in the past.

616
00:43:30,692 --> 00:43:36,790
Speaker 1: There's like this flashback because Margils was tote taken by gold and that's right.

617
00:43:36,850 --> 00:43:38,113
Speaker 1: magic man was mad right.

618
00:43:38,153 --> 00:43:41,340
Speaker 1: Mars is like the advanced space society.

619
00:43:41,767 --> 00:43:42,560
Speaker 0: That is.

620
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:49,840
Speaker 0: Well, Mars is Mars basically the people of Mars because they're you know, they have Abraham Lincoln king of Mars.

621
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:55,076
Speaker 0: They're like society and gobb gobb gobb grab basically lives there as their leader also.

622
00:43:55,096 --> 00:43:58,568
Speaker 0: and you know normal Slash magic man also lived like Mars.

623
00:43:59,030 --> 00:43:59,813
Speaker 0: That is a mark.

624
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:15,679
Speaker 0: That is a society that was Connected with like what's going on in the universe right sort of like a foundation situation Right where it's like, oh that society basically doesn't have interstellar travel yet They're sort of like just a you know, like an ant colony is to us.

625
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,768
Speaker 1: Well, I got the people of who could fight the Lich.

626
00:44:19,310 --> 00:44:22,780
Speaker 1: the Mars people were the ones who could fight something like Orgellar.

627
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,808
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then gold is just.

628
00:44:25,330 --> 00:44:27,820
Speaker 0: I mean, I mean the first time Orgellar came in the past.

629
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,651
Speaker 0: You know gobb just basically took a sword and swacked them.

630
00:44:30,852 --> 00:44:35,233
Speaker 0: Yep, and that thing and turn them into Gunther just like whacking them.

631
00:44:35,314 --> 00:44:37,622
Speaker 0: That's how strong gobb is Right.

632
00:44:37,842 --> 00:44:39,649
Speaker 0: Yeah gobb is you know, he is God.

633
00:44:39,749 --> 00:44:41,073
Speaker 0: to the people of who right?

634
00:44:41,114 --> 00:44:44,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like but to the people of Mars He's just a dude of forehead.

635
00:44:44,660 --> 00:44:46,440
Speaker 1: Well see also Prismo and the cosmic hour.

636
00:44:47,082 --> 00:44:52,060
Speaker 1: Four dudes Prismo and the cosmic owl and all these entities are just gods out there doing their thing, right?

637
00:44:52,180 --> 00:44:56,598
Speaker 1: But I like how they're all framed as themselves being mundane just on a different scale.

638
00:44:56,919 --> 00:44:59,412
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean that's just hanging out with the cosmic owl.

639
00:44:59,432 --> 00:45:01,080
Speaker 1: The cosmic owl is not that smart.

640
00:45:01,662 --> 00:45:02,265
Speaker 0: No, he's not.

641
00:45:02,285 --> 00:45:11,960
Speaker 1: cosmic owls got issues, but when he's first presented he is like this Supremely spiritual important being to the people of who yep with their whole thing about the croak dreams, right?

642
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:21,825
Speaker 0: But meanwhile on ooh The only people like even the people I knew who've been alive for a very very long time like say Marceline Yeah, Prince Bubblegum.

643
00:45:21,845 --> 00:45:22,528
Speaker 0: That's the final.

644
00:45:22,548 --> 00:45:23,652
Speaker 0: they don't know what's up.

645
00:45:23,933 --> 00:45:27,345
Speaker 0: only Billy on earth really knows What's all that stuff.

646
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:31,740
Speaker 1: and Billy might have gone insane, you know and retired partly because he knew these things.

647
00:45:31,881 --> 00:45:34,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably like Billy was too powerful.

648
00:45:34,782 --> 00:45:43,728
Speaker 1: Also, it is implied heavily that Billy is part of an ancient race That was way more powerful than anything that came on earth since yeah, cuz remember when almost like a dinosaur They didn't become extinct.

649
00:45:43,748 --> 00:45:44,131
Speaker 0: Well, cuz when?

650
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:44,715
Speaker 1: what's-her-name?

651
00:45:44,756 --> 00:45:46,401
Speaker 1: the other Nereator?

652
00:45:46,422 --> 00:45:48,850
Speaker 1: whoever the girl who was can you Billy's girlfriend?

653
00:45:48,890 --> 00:45:49,934
Speaker 1: Yeah, Billy's girlfriend.

654
00:45:50,355 --> 00:45:53,005
Speaker 1: She clearly is Terrifyingly powerful.

655
00:45:53,246 --> 00:45:56,640
Speaker 1: Yes, and I liked how her and Finn just kind of hung out like that was a cool thing.

656
00:45:57,862 --> 00:45:58,788
Speaker 1: Man, this show was good.

657
00:45:59,050 --> 00:46:00,298
Speaker 1: I feel like we could talk about it for hours.

658
00:46:00,682 --> 00:46:02,199
Speaker 0: Well, I mean there's so much show.

659
00:46:02,490 --> 00:46:09,828
Speaker 0: Yeah when we do an episode we we made a video show about a single episode of utenna and our video show is longer than that single episode of utenna.

660
00:46:10,130 --> 00:46:15,422
Speaker 0: and now you want to talk about a 10 11 season Show.

661
00:46:15,442 --> 00:46:21,340
Speaker 1: I feel like I have between 5 and 25 minutes of things to say about every single episode of adventure time.

662
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,436
Speaker 0: Right every single character every single right, you know, alright, let's get the fun.

663
00:46:25,477 --> 00:46:26,260
Speaker 1: Who's your favorite character?

664
00:46:26,782 --> 00:46:28,449
Speaker 1: You're really really at its choose goose.

665
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:30,377
Speaker 0: Yeah, why wouldn't it be Tuesday?

666
00:46:30,438 --> 00:46:31,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's tough Cuz.

667
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:38,300
Speaker 0: on one hand a lot of great characters, you know, especially and as always right I end up liking side characters more than me.

668
00:46:38,340 --> 00:46:40,602
Speaker 1: Yeah, I really like huntress wizard Like I like.

669
00:46:40,622 --> 00:46:42,369
Speaker 1: they just threw her in a lot at the address.

670
00:46:42,389 --> 00:46:45,040
Speaker 0: wizard is cool and not as cool as peppermint butler.

671
00:46:45,482 --> 00:46:58,215
Speaker 1: Oh, I love how fucking evil peppermint butler is But also how at the end of the show like there were Consequences of that fight like that little tiny scene of peppermint butler like they couldn't fix him.

672
00:46:58,776 --> 00:46:59,920
Speaker 1: They're just raising him again.

673
00:47:00,301 --> 00:47:03,455
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're raising him to be evil again because why not?

674
00:47:03,576 --> 00:47:05,124
Speaker 0: Well, I think he's just All right.

675
00:47:05,668 --> 00:47:15,431
Speaker 0: Well, that's you know, that's one of the main Themes of the show is that in every different universe and you know You see the same people over and over again and only

676
00:47:15,491 --> 00:47:19,311
Speaker 1: Marceline and the space people ever know Like the cycle

677
00:47:19,716 --> 00:47:30,156
Speaker 0: right and Also, even in the same timeline the same things repeat themselves Right those two characters that go to visit BMO and then in the final episode

678
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:31,200
Speaker 1: are basically Jake

679
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:33,017
Speaker 0: They're like a Finn and Jake of their time,

680
00:47:33,098 --> 00:47:33,239
Speaker 1: right?

681
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:40,272
Speaker 1: Cuz that world is too clearly post-apocalyptic to the world that right elements Right are the except for one of them.

682
00:47:40,332 --> 00:47:43,909
Speaker 0: the other three are like, oh, yeah The same people keep getting reborn.

683
00:47:43,929 --> 00:47:45,395
Speaker 1: look at that other the sex also.

684
00:47:45,455 --> 00:47:48,014
Speaker 0: why you don't need to see Oh, they live the rest of their lives.

685
00:47:48,135 --> 00:47:53,960
Speaker 0: cuz you know It's just a cycle of the same shit in every timeline and in every you know universe.

686
00:47:54,121 --> 00:47:56,120
Speaker 0: Look at all these things happening over and over again.

687
00:47:56,120 --> 00:47:57,444
Speaker 1: Look at the cycle looks slightly.

688
00:47:57,504 --> 00:48:02,339
Speaker 1: so the characters who break the cycle are all themselves broken in some way.

689
00:48:02,701 --> 00:48:08,368
Speaker 1: Marceline being immortal also never grew and Couldn't change and that was the whole plot of stakes of.

690
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:11,740
Speaker 1: she had to experience that cycle to like understand herself.

691
00:48:12,181 --> 00:48:15,594
Speaker 1: The Lich is an entity that's trying to end the cycle forever.

692
00:48:15,614 --> 00:48:17,120
Speaker 1: So he's all messed up.

693
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:22,100
Speaker 0: Well, that's why you know and that the exact opposite of the Lich is Prisma who is basically is the cycle, right?

694
00:48:22,260 --> 00:48:25,179
Speaker 0: I was whereas, you know, there's a sleepy guy who's dreaming of Prisma.

695
00:48:25,461 --> 00:48:33,760
Speaker 0: He gets woken up Prisma goes away and then a past Prisma pulls a trick to make a sleepy Jake That is then dreaming of Prisma and then Prisma's there again.

696
00:48:33,961 --> 00:48:37,503
Speaker 0: There's a sleepy Jake there for all eternity and it's like that Cycle there.

697
00:48:37,543 --> 00:48:39,510
Speaker 0: that happens in that like one or two episodes.

698
00:48:39,550 --> 00:48:49,180
Speaker 0: that thing where Prisma goes away and comes back is I guess the cosmic, you know loop that holds all the other cosmic loops in in the in the cannon.

699
00:48:49,481 --> 00:48:54,667
Speaker 0: And you see the same thing with what's like a Prisma had failed at that mission Then there probably would have been it.

700
00:48:54,788 --> 00:48:59,588
Speaker 1: what pin the the ice elemental Instead of dying like she should in the cycle.

701
00:49:00,030 --> 00:49:02,677
Speaker 1: She just never changes is trapped.

702
00:49:02,697 --> 00:49:03,038
Speaker 1: Basically.

703
00:49:03,058 --> 00:49:07,925
Speaker 1: She's trapped herself She'll wake up and anytime she wakes up Nothing will be different or better.

704
00:49:08,547 --> 00:49:12,520
Speaker 1: and she's basically destroyed herself by being outside of the cycle.

705
00:49:12,841 --> 00:49:19,960
Speaker 1: And then you've got things like gold that are themselves outside of the cycle because that's that's terrifying secret of space incomprehensible nonsense.

706
00:49:21,165 --> 00:49:32,880
Speaker 0: Yeah wonder it's like, you know There was a Lich in every different universe right that we went to right like the the weird one that would like quaint country time Fin right and the bandit dudes or whatever, right?

707
00:49:32,980 --> 00:49:37,460
Speaker 0: There was a Lich there who wasn't the exact same Lich as the other one, right?

708
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:45,186
Speaker 1: Then you see characters in the cycle breaking the negative aspect of their cycle like sweet pea Who is just good in the end?

709
00:49:45,688 --> 00:49:46,271
Speaker 1: He's like, nope.

710
00:49:46,351 --> 00:49:47,476
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna be like you Lich.

711
00:49:47,596 --> 00:49:48,038
Speaker 1: Fuck you.

712
00:49:48,058 --> 00:49:49,303
Speaker 0: Yes He is awesome.

713
00:49:49,504 --> 00:49:50,047
Speaker 0: He's the next.

714
00:49:50,067 --> 00:49:52,940
Speaker 0: did you notice the very end of very end of the show?

715
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:56,620
Speaker 0: There's a giant sweet pea walking past the bemo mountain.

716
00:49:57,041 --> 00:50:02,444
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got enormous like bigger than I think that might be the giantest thing I get like.

717
00:50:02,765 --> 00:50:05,615
Speaker 0: as big as sweet pea was there was bigger than gold was.

718
00:50:05,816 --> 00:50:06,780
Speaker 1: Yep real big.

719
00:50:07,261 --> 00:50:12,900
Speaker 1: I just love that moment where sweet pea one scares the shit out of that evil squirrel in the king of ooh.

720
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,071
Speaker 1: Because they were the worst characters in the show, right?

721
00:50:15,433 --> 00:50:27,406
Speaker 0: You know, I think the most The thing that really I feel needed more tying up or maybe the juice juice or maybe was appropriately not tied up Was Tree trunks.

722
00:50:27,446 --> 00:50:29,777
Speaker 0: cuz tree trunks is so she's there.

723
00:50:29,797 --> 00:50:40,850
Speaker 1: from the beginning I noticed they hinted at things in the old old flashback episodes with the original elementals that we see There's those weird tree trunks looking being.

724
00:50:40,930 --> 00:50:41,231
Speaker 1: Yep.

725
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:41,753
Speaker 0: Yep.

726
00:50:41,813 --> 00:50:42,013
Speaker 0: Yep.

727
00:50:42,354 --> 00:50:51,786
Speaker 1: I'm saying she is ancient and Basically as best I can tell it's like a magic elf who gave up on all the weird magic elf stuff and just wanted to be Perverted forever.

728
00:50:51,806 --> 00:50:53,236
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like.

729
00:50:53,296 --> 00:50:59,957
Speaker 0: it's like Cuz tree trunks spans like the cosmic and the mundane and like this crazy weird fucked up way.

730
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:11,183
Speaker 0: and it's like sometimes She's just insane and sometimes she's super lucid and knows that Relations with aliens and knows about aliens and doesn't care that much The pig guy.

731
00:51:11,223 --> 00:51:12,828
Speaker 0: Yeah, he cares a lot.

732
00:51:13,088 --> 00:51:16,498
Speaker 0: then she goes to the woods and deals like crystal whatnot?

733
00:51:16,658 --> 00:51:17,360
Speaker 0: craziness?

734
00:51:17,501 --> 00:51:20,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, also just makes a pie as delicious.

735
00:51:20,821 --> 00:51:28,100
Speaker 1: But all these I love the way all these different characters and how they interact with this like cosmic cycle are threaded together.

736
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:28,603
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

737
00:51:29,187 --> 00:51:29,630
Speaker 1: Goddamn.

738
00:51:29,650 --> 00:51:30,315
Speaker 1: The show is good.

739
00:51:30,396 --> 00:51:38,923
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I Got a little choked up at the very end just because of I saw it coming as soon as like it was wrapping up and they Start walking back.

740
00:51:39,204 --> 00:51:40,930
Speaker 1: I knew the way the show had gone.

741
00:51:41,231 --> 00:51:43,319
Speaker 1: The last moment was gonna be the theme song.

742
00:51:44,003 --> 00:51:47,169
Speaker 0: But that montage that was the name of the last episode is You know.

743
00:51:48,801 --> 00:51:51,212
Speaker 0: But is the name of the first episode at Adventure Time?

744
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:51,875
Speaker 1: I think so.

745
00:51:51,895 --> 00:51:53,120
Speaker 0: Like come grab your friends or something?

746
00:51:53,180 --> 00:51:56,863
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I guess the name of the last episode is you know Come along with me.

747
00:51:56,923 --> 00:52:05,820
Speaker 1: the fact that they did it like they did the perfect ending of the final scene is just The song that has ended the show that you watched for like a decade.

748
00:52:05,981 --> 00:52:07,711
Speaker 0: Well, it's good because they didn't do a new tenor.

749
00:52:07,732 --> 00:52:09,120
Speaker 0: where it's like this horse is all the time.

750
00:52:09,201 --> 00:52:10,315
Speaker 0: I never see the horses like this.

751
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:14,224
Speaker 0: is me All right, we'll put the B at the end I just imagine.

752
00:52:14,244 --> 00:52:17,495
Speaker 1: to this day dammit Dwayne is where is wherever he is and is.

753
00:52:17,576 --> 00:52:22,575
Speaker 1: he's in a crazy room Filled with pictures of those horses trying to figure out where they happen.

754
00:52:22,595 --> 00:52:23,900
Speaker 0: I like how they hide a snail.

755
00:52:24,181 --> 00:52:27,216
Speaker 0: I don't know if they hide a snail in every episode, but it's 99% of the episodes.

756
00:52:28,302 --> 00:52:31,620
Speaker 0: But the thing is I feel like I only saw the snail and like half the episodes.

757
00:52:32,042 --> 00:52:35,940
Speaker 0: So I'm always like did they really put one all the time because I feel like I noticed it a lot.

758
00:52:36,001 --> 00:52:37,399
Speaker 0: I'm really good at noticing the snail.

759
00:52:37,681 --> 00:52:41,193
Speaker 1: Well, the fact that the snail is the only reason the Lich even gets out.

760
00:52:41,555 --> 00:52:44,267
Speaker 0: I know right a plus Yep, it's like.

761
00:52:44,307 --> 00:52:45,232
Speaker 0: it's not just a hidden snail.

762
00:52:45,252 --> 00:52:45,895
Speaker 0: It's a plot snail.

763
00:52:45,915 --> 00:52:52,300
Speaker 1: Yeah But just it's heavy and good the way that like Marceline's arc and stakes in particular

764
00:52:52,561 --> 00:52:55,091
Speaker 0: I'm sure there's a website that says every time the snail is like

765
00:52:55,132 --> 00:53:05,259
Speaker 1: the snail busts that out and like there's all these breaking the cycles just the fact that there's those little moments of the Handful of characters who live long enough to see the cycle repeat even a little bit.

766
00:53:05,964 --> 00:53:08,060
Speaker 1: They get bill bowed like they're different.

767
00:53:08,562 --> 00:53:12,520
Speaker 0: So one of my favorite episodes is actually an episode that doesn't matter for the plot really at all.

768
00:53:13,363 --> 00:53:14,687
Speaker 0: Is the infinity train one?

769
00:53:15,148 --> 00:53:18,620
Speaker 1: Oh, I like that one a lot because it has aka why you shouldn't play MMOs?

770
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:29,040
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly because there's this strong message right of don't play most Right, but also it's actually pretty cool fighting all these monsters not cool training the world.

771
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,067
Speaker 1: You got to know when to stop right.

772
00:53:31,348 --> 00:53:39,198
Speaker 0: but it also has you know this sort of greater message Right where it's like Finn sees that like Jake's been following him forever, right?

773
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:45,507
Speaker 0: And he's like, oh my friend is maybe more important than this Serotonin loop whatever whatever it is.

774
00:53:45,547 --> 00:53:49,360
Speaker 1: I think my favorite episode is what was missing with the door Lord.

775
00:53:49,460 --> 00:53:50,124
Speaker 0: It's a real good one.

776
00:53:50,165 --> 00:53:52,760
Speaker 1: But my second favorite episode is the hall of egress.

777
00:53:53,530 --> 00:53:55,081
Speaker 0: It's a good one, too Cuz.

778
00:53:55,201 --> 00:54:04,100
Speaker 1: that episode feels a lot like Don Jean the comic like that kind of thing that sort of existential surreal experience.

779
00:54:05,961 --> 00:54:11,617
Speaker 1: That episode really stands out among the great episodes of Adventure Time as being my favorite.

780
00:54:11,637 --> 00:54:13,906
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I'm sure there's one.

781
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:14,408
Speaker 1: I like that.

782
00:54:14,428 --> 00:54:15,914
Speaker 1: I'm forgetting though just scrolling through.

783
00:54:15,934 --> 00:54:17,460
Speaker 1: there are a lot of freaking episodes.

784
00:54:17,540 --> 00:54:20,233
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's tons of way a plus episodes.

785
00:54:20,314 --> 00:54:20,595
Speaker 1: Yep.

786
00:54:21,620 --> 00:54:22,384
Speaker 1: I Think we'll just leave it there.

787
00:54:22,444 --> 00:54:25,037
Speaker 1: cuz as much as I would love I gotta go eat dinner.

788
00:54:25,057 --> 00:54:31,080
Speaker 1: Yeah We are not going to make nice presents Adventure Time because that would be harder that would take.

789
00:54:31,100 --> 00:54:33,291
Speaker 0: I'm sure other people are doing things like that.

790
00:54:33,472 --> 00:54:34,196
Speaker 0: You know, there's plenty of it.

791
00:54:34,236 --> 00:54:34,799
Speaker 0: You don't need us.
