1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:13,277
Speaker 0: It's Monday April 7th, and this is geek night.

2
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,820
Speaker 0: tonight We finish out the IT CS alternating bits with network monitoring.

3
00:00:25,901 --> 00:00:26,917
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:31,044 --> 00:00:37,660
Speaker 0: So for various reasons today, this isn't my opening vid my anecdote It's Emily's but I think it was good because you know she stayed home.

5
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:48,000
Speaker 0: So she wanted some food and instead of driving to the nearest grocery store, which is actually pretty far away She went to the local grocery store, which is the one that's the bullshit grocery store.

6
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:59,073
Speaker 0: That's the problem because it has all the great kind of hippie food that I like but interspersed with all that nice hippie food is Homeopathy and fake medicine and just Randy bullshit left and right.

7
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:01,040
Speaker 1: Why do they have to have the two things associated?

8
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:06,980
Speaker 1: We should just open up a grocery store, right and we don't say like Organic or whatever or any bullshit like that.

9
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:12,840
Speaker 1: We just say look this food is exactly the same as that of the food except because it was grown somewhere near here.

10
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:13,583
Speaker 1: It tastes better.

11
00:01:13,864 --> 00:01:14,266
Speaker 1: That's all.

12
00:01:14,366 --> 00:01:15,491
Speaker 1: that's the only advantage.

13
00:01:15,552 --> 00:01:17,500
Speaker 0: really well also they can't just in general.

14
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,771
Speaker 0: They carry things like real root beer.

15
00:01:19,872 --> 00:01:27,686
Speaker 0: No grocery store here has real root beer But that place has like ten different kinds of say like, you know Organic fancy pants.

16
00:01:27,746 --> 00:01:29,193
Speaker 1: make your life healthier root beer.

17
00:01:29,213 --> 00:01:30,480
Speaker 1: We'll say look, this is root beer.

18
00:01:30,922 --> 00:01:33,820
Speaker 1: It costs more but it's made with real sugar and it tastes better.

19
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:36,180
Speaker 0: I don't think they make any claims about the root beer at that place.

20
00:01:36,863 --> 00:01:40,840
Speaker 1: It's not so much exact claims written in text, but it's the marketing of it.

21
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:42,044
Speaker 1: You know, it's.

22
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:45,537
Speaker 0: I don't think root beer has ever been marketed as good for you in any way.

23
00:01:45,557 --> 00:01:47,607
Speaker 1: Oh That's a root beer.

24
00:01:47,627 --> 00:01:48,794
Speaker 1: people have something to say to you.

25
00:01:49,317 --> 00:01:49,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know what?

26
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:52,295
Speaker 0: I am a root beer person as much as I like my dr.

27
00:01:52,315 --> 00:01:52,657
Speaker 0: Pepper.

28
00:01:52,717 --> 00:02:00,246
Speaker 0: deep down I'm a root beer man, and I can tell you next time we have the Visigoths over to play some burning wheel I have a root beer keg.

29
00:02:00,426 --> 00:02:07,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, I don't drink sodas and carbonated things But I've had root beer dum-dums and those are actually my favorite dum-dums.

30
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:12,440
Speaker 1: You know, you might really like if I were to drink a a a beverage like that.

31
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,799
Speaker 1: I think root beer might be my thing.

32
00:02:13,961 --> 00:02:19,715
Speaker 0: You could always get the root beer and put it on ice and then it won't be carbonated anymore And then it just tastes like a dum-dum.

33
00:02:21,544 --> 00:02:22,447
Speaker 1: But they would be flat.

34
00:02:22,487 --> 00:02:24,352
Speaker 1: then wanna be bleh if it's flat.

35
00:02:24,734 --> 00:02:27,885
Speaker 0: Well, it's flat, but you don't like the don flat Yeah, but ugly.

36
00:02:28,046 --> 00:02:30,860
Speaker 1: but at the same time if you take away the bubbles, doesn't that alter the flavor?

37
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,788
Speaker 0: No, it's more than we like the bubbles.

38
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:34,920
Speaker 0: That's just people like the bubbles.

39
00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:39,312
Speaker 1: I mean, that's sort of like, you know If you like stale bread better than like.

40
00:02:39,353 --> 00:02:41,987
Speaker 1: if I don't like a loaf of bread I'm not gonna let it go stale.

41
00:02:42,027 --> 00:02:46,147
Speaker 0: and then you might because a dum-dum is just stale root beer I know but I'm saying is like.

42
00:02:46,187 --> 00:02:48,760
Speaker 1: let's say there's a loaf of bread, right and it's a kind of bread.

43
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:54,772
Speaker 1: I don't like some weird like bread with all sorts of like fish in it or something I don't know sort of fish bread.

44
00:02:54,812 --> 00:02:55,215
Speaker 0: You know what?

45
00:02:55,235 --> 00:02:56,100
Speaker 0: I wouldn't mind a fish bread.

46
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,755
Speaker 1: I'm just kind of good and that you know, and then the bread goes stale.

47
00:02:59,775 --> 00:03:01,542
Speaker 1: I'm not suddenly gonna like it It's got.

48
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:02,325
Speaker 0: it's the opposite.

49
00:03:02,586 --> 00:03:05,577
Speaker 0: You're one of those people who ate some stale fish fish bread.

50
00:03:05,597 --> 00:03:06,079
Speaker 0: You're like hot.

51
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,520
Speaker 0: damn I like the stale fish bread.

52
00:03:08,103 --> 00:03:09,107
Speaker 0: Hey, I wonder if I can.

53
00:03:09,148 --> 00:03:11,539
Speaker 0: if I like the real fish bread then you try it, you know like it.

54
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:12,792
Speaker 0: That's what happened to you.

55
00:03:14,465 --> 00:03:15,560
Speaker 0: We can do some experiment.

56
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:21,291
Speaker 0: Well, you can take a sip of root beer and then you can take a sip of flat root beer and then you can eat a dum-dum.

57
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:27,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think I'm actually just gonna avoid drinking the sugar water and keep my teeth high quality.

58
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,186
Speaker 0: You know sugar water isn't what kills teeth.

59
00:03:29,366 --> 00:03:31,533
Speaker 0: not brushing them is what kills teeth.

60
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:32,556
Speaker 0: also lemonade.

61
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:36,706
Speaker 1: Yes It's just another form of sugar water.

62
00:03:36,927 --> 00:03:39,696
Speaker 0: no lemonade is the worst possible thing you can drink.

63
00:03:39,756 --> 00:03:44,891
Speaker 0: every dentist will tell you that Yeah destroys teeth faster than anything except maybe hydrofluoric acid.

64
00:03:45,052 --> 00:03:45,252
Speaker 1: Yeah.

65
00:03:45,312 --> 00:03:47,599
Speaker 1: Well, I mean lemonade's the worst but so it is bad.

66
00:03:48,142 --> 00:03:49,620
Speaker 1: Also, it's just not as bad.

67
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:58,619
Speaker 0: But anyway, I have a love-hate relationship with this store as you might guess because I like half the stuff in there But I'm morally opposed to the other half of the stuff in there.

68
00:03:59,001 --> 00:04:00,225
Speaker 0: But there's a third factor.

69
00:04:00,426 --> 00:04:03,578
Speaker 0: the employees are all jackasses at least the ones I've interacted with.

70
00:04:03,879 --> 00:04:04,240
Speaker 1: Oh, really?

71
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, ever interacted with the employees there?

72
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,640
Speaker 1: I think only thing ever bought there was a head of lettuce and then I discovered the homeopathies.

73
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:18,159
Speaker 0: but anyway Emily went there and she was buying some stuff and she saw in line in front of her Someone who was Randy times two.

74
00:04:18,862 --> 00:04:25,400
Speaker 0: So they had in their basket homeopathy and they even had asked some questions about like which homeopathy is better.

75
00:04:26,102 --> 00:04:30,276
Speaker 0: But they also had in their basket Ronnie book Ronnie Brooke Farms,

76
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,961
Speaker 1: oh Now that the the farm that our friend warned us is not good That

77
00:04:36,021 --> 00:04:43,037
Speaker 0: is the farm Ronnie Brooke Farms that we've been warned by people in the know is like the most health violating farm out there and

78
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:45,999
Speaker 1: I hope this doesn't get him in trouble.

79
00:04:46,461 --> 00:04:48,629
Speaker 0: Emily was thinking about saying something to this woman.

80
00:04:48,669 --> 00:04:51,760
Speaker 0: then she realized that perhaps one will punish the other.

81
00:04:56,181 --> 00:05:01,756
Speaker 0: That's all I got because you have something much more interesting something the listeners are very very looking forward to.

82
00:05:01,836 --> 00:05:02,578
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

83
00:05:02,598 --> 00:05:04,524
Speaker 1: yes Uh, yeah, I don't know either.

84
00:05:04,544 --> 00:05:08,335
Speaker 0: Yeah, wait, we're gonna do what some sort of inside gig nights.

85
00:05:08,436 --> 00:05:09,719
Speaker 0: how gig nights is done?

86
00:05:10,201 --> 00:05:15,520
Speaker 0: Reminisce boxers Scott laying upside down on a chair mumbling now, so it's the audio podcasts.

87
00:05:16,002 --> 00:05:20,280
Speaker 1: You obviously like them you're listening to them, but they don't catch on so much.

88
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:22,990
Speaker 1: Right, the big thing on the internet now is videos.

89
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:31,819
Speaker 1: people like them videos and we thought about doing the videos But we didn't have video skills or equipment or the time because gig nights used to take a lot of time for us to do.

90
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:33,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, not so much anymore.

91
00:05:33,532 --> 00:05:34,520
Speaker 1: So we didn't have a camera.

92
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:39,818
Speaker 1: I mean I had my normal photo digital camera that could take videos, but that's that's not gonna cut it.

93
00:05:40,803 --> 00:05:44,380
Speaker 1: So we've been thinking about a video camera, you know, we're like, oh which one do we get?

94
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:54,287
Speaker 1: And I discovered this one that's coming out in a month or two And I thought we would go get it because it has like internal flash memory But also takes extra flash memory.

95
00:05:54,327 --> 00:05:56,454
Speaker 1: and I was like, oh that that sounds good to me.

96
00:05:56,675 --> 00:05:57,819
Speaker 1: that seems like it'll work for us.

97
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:06,380
Speaker 1: But I also got a new credit card the second credit card I ever had in my life and I the old one is the Sony one right with all the points.

98
00:06:06,902 --> 00:06:11,520
Speaker 1: So I was like I need to get rid of these points, but absolutely nothing Sony makes is something I want.

99
00:06:11,982 --> 00:06:16,501
Speaker 1: I mean, I could have got a free ps2 or we could have gotten a GPS 3.

100
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:21,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, but if I would have got a ps3, I wouldn't need an HDTV, which I wasn't gonna get.

101
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:24,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least not until I get new house also at least one game.

102
00:06:24,411 --> 00:06:32,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's like, uh now I'm thinking well I just get a Sony camera that was like, uh, but is the Sony camera gonna work with Linux and whatnot?

103
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:32,922
Speaker 1: Is it?

104
00:06:33,305 --> 00:06:34,414
Speaker 1: you know, there are all these questions.

105
00:06:34,495 --> 00:06:35,099
Speaker 1: I said, you know what?

106
00:06:35,881 --> 00:06:44,720
Speaker 1: I looked I went to the Best Buy and I just got the cheapest Hard drive based Sony camera they had and I use the points on it.

107
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,328
Speaker 1: So it's gonna cost almost nothing.

108
00:06:46,429 --> 00:06:58,959
Speaker 0: now our philosophy here is the same thing We did with geek nights and if any of you ever have a creative endeavor in front of you This is what you should do when there's a capital purchase involved buy the cheapest whatever that works and use it.

109
00:06:59,661 --> 00:07:04,918
Speaker 0: You'll learn what things you need and don't need on the real one and you'll know what to buy later.

110
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:11,000
Speaker 0: I mean we bought a crappy little mixer and then after a year of geek nights like alright, I need another bus.

111
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:13,287
Speaker 0: Goddamnit, do I need another bus?

112
00:07:13,769 --> 00:07:15,457
Speaker 0: So we bought a mixer with another bus.

113
00:07:15,859 --> 00:07:20,260
Speaker 1: Yep So I'm gonna use this cheap-ass camera, it's actually not too bad.

114
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:23,772
Speaker 1: I mean, it's not HD, but it has a 30 gig hard drive in it.

115
00:07:23,812 --> 00:07:24,495
Speaker 0: YouTube's.

116
00:07:24,816 --> 00:07:25,799
Speaker 0: Yeah, we don't need HD.

117
00:07:26,341 --> 00:07:34,976
Speaker 1: So we're gonna make YouTube's and things and learn the video skills and hopefully our YouTube's will be good in some way I don't know.

118
00:07:35,772 --> 00:07:38,951
Speaker 1: also You know, I read that first prince of nothing book.

119
00:07:38,971 --> 00:07:40,155
Speaker 1: So I was trying to get the second one.

120
00:07:40,557 --> 00:07:43,540
Speaker 1: our Scott backer Amazon only has the third one.

121
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:47,060
Speaker 1: They don't have the first of the second one, at least not in paperback and I have buy no hardback.

122
00:07:47,704 --> 00:07:50,339
Speaker 1: So I went to some bookstores and I couldn't find it.

123
00:07:50,901 --> 00:07:53,450
Speaker 1: You know what bookstore had all three of them in paperback?

124
00:07:53,570 --> 00:08:01,820
Speaker 0: the one in Grand Central the shitty one in Grand Central, you know I gotta admit as that place isn't actually nearly as overpriced as I expected it to be.

125
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:04,634
Speaker 1: Well, no, it was cover price, but it was still that bookstore.

126
00:08:04,714 --> 00:08:05,900
Speaker 1: Usually I was like the worst election.

127
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:11,360
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, I went to the sort of highbrow bookstore near my work and Soho, you know, it's all fancy.

128
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:25,265
Speaker 1: They didn't have that book but they if you went to the graphic novel section it like every highbrow graphic novel like every single one like every will Eisner and everything vertical publishes and everything and I was like Ah, look at that.

129
00:08:25,285 --> 00:08:26,311
Speaker 1: I have all those books.

130
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:27,739
Speaker 1: I don't need to buy any of the mirror, huh?

131
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:29,226
Speaker 0: So I gotta ask one thing.

132
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:32,020
Speaker 0: we'll talk about this in much more detail someday in the future.

133
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:41,342
Speaker 0: but I've been kind of raving about the prince of nothing the darkness that comes before and Pretty much everyone has been trying to get Scott to read this book for a while They finally read it.

134
00:08:41,845 --> 00:08:44,073
Speaker 0: All I want to ask you Scott is is it a good book?

135
00:08:44,273 --> 00:08:44,976
Speaker 1: It's a good book.

136
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,500
Speaker 0: I You should all read it seriously.

137
00:08:50,384 --> 00:08:55,936
Speaker 1: It wasn't like, you know So great that I should have dropped everything I was doing in read it like I don't know.

138
00:08:56,198 --> 00:08:56,740
Speaker 0: I'm so far.

139
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,406
Speaker 0: It's one of the best books I've ever written.

140
00:08:58,606 --> 00:09:00,232
Speaker 0: read read not written.

141
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:01,316
Speaker 0: I did not write it.

142
00:09:01,617 --> 00:09:02,420
Speaker 1: I don't know about that.

143
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:02,922
Speaker 1: I mean, it's a.

144
00:09:03,063 --> 00:09:05,694
Speaker 0: it's a good book if you read what.

145
00:09:05,774 --> 00:09:07,160
Speaker 0: what better book is have you read?

146
00:09:11,703 --> 00:09:13,760
Speaker 0: I like name one.

147
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,585
Speaker 1: Ha there's so many.

148
00:09:17,726 --> 00:09:18,428
Speaker 0: yeah, I'm sure.

149
00:09:18,489 --> 00:09:21,259
Speaker 0: could you name one doesn't have to be the top one, huh?

150
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:21,961
Speaker 1: It's just.

151
00:09:22,001 --> 00:09:22,583
Speaker 1: there's so many.

152
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:24,350
Speaker 1: it's hard to share American gods.

153
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,293
Speaker 1: I think it's a better book.

154
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:27,000
Speaker 0: you American gods is up there.

155
00:09:27,745 --> 00:09:29,236
Speaker 0: I don't think American God said as much.

156
00:09:29,276 --> 00:09:33,113
Speaker 1: he was a amazing Cavalier and clay is a better book.

157
00:09:33,153 --> 00:09:34,000
Speaker 0: I got to read that first.

158
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:41,295
Speaker 0: I Know that there's not so many classics coming out of you.

159
00:09:41,335 --> 00:09:45,183
Speaker 0: yet here Hamlet is.

160
00:09:45,304 --> 00:09:46,228
Speaker 1: it's not a book.

161
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,112
Speaker 1: It's it's the book.

162
00:09:47,132 --> 00:09:48,760
Speaker 0: It's also not that good.

163
00:09:49,182 --> 00:09:51,978
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I like Hamlet, but everyone likes Hamlet.

164
00:09:53,161 --> 00:10:00,694
Speaker 0: Besides you know what I'm gonna say this reading Hamlet is all well and good But if you have not seen the Kenneth Branagh Hamlet, you do not know Hamlet.

165
00:10:00,734 --> 00:10:00,915
Speaker 0: Good.

166
00:10:00,935 --> 00:10:01,176
Speaker 0: God.

167
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:02,259
Speaker 0: Is that the best Hamlet ever?

168
00:10:03,183 --> 00:10:03,831
Speaker 1: Cats cradles.

169
00:10:03,871 --> 00:10:10,019
Speaker 0: a better book All right all right anyway, so I got some news here.

170
00:10:10,421 --> 00:10:13,716
Speaker 0: This is news that was relevant to me back in the year 2000. give or take.

171
00:10:14,842 --> 00:10:19,506
Speaker 0: I don't think it'll be relevant to any of you, and if you think it's relevant well You're gonna learn why it's not.

172
00:10:20,028 --> 00:10:22,620
Speaker 0: so not everywhere in the United States does this.

173
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:25,951
Speaker 0: But there's something called the Advanced Placement Board in the AP test.

174
00:10:26,252 --> 00:10:28,740
Speaker 1: Oh, I saw that news and the deal.

175
00:10:29,742 --> 00:10:32,319
Speaker 0: It amazes me how many people don't know that this is out there.

176
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:41,466
Speaker 0: but basically what you can do in high school is you can pay like 70 bucks and take a test with these people and They give you a score from one to five.

177
00:10:41,947 --> 00:10:44,255
Speaker 0: one means you are dumbass.

178
00:10:44,556 --> 00:10:45,659
Speaker 1: really can you get lower than one?

179
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:48,107
Speaker 1: No, everything wrong is a one.

180
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:50,255
Speaker 1: Yes, the thing is I get one right.

181
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:50,616
Speaker 1: do I get it?

182
00:10:50,877 --> 00:10:51,339
Speaker 1: do I get two?

183
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:53,107
Speaker 0: I don't pretty much the way.

184
00:10:53,589 --> 00:10:55,340
Speaker 0: the way that I mean it's one through three four five.

185
00:10:55,902 --> 00:11:06,680
Speaker 0: The way it actually works is a five means you know your shit and a four is like okay And a three is like yeah, you barely made it and a lot of colleges will accept three fours or fives.

186
00:11:06,781 --> 00:11:26,003
Speaker 0: but I say colleges because the way this works is you take the test and You get a score and they keep track of all your scores and then you submit these scores to whatever college or university you attend and Most pretty much any university worth a damn will give you credit college credit based on What classes you took.

187
00:11:26,364 --> 00:11:33,530
Speaker 1: so if you get a four on the AP calculus test and then you go to college and they have you Know they say oh you're gonna need.

188
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:37,353
Speaker 1: you're a computer science student You need to take calculus classes in order to graduate.

189
00:11:37,373 --> 00:11:37,976
Speaker 1: you say oh, no.

190
00:11:37,996 --> 00:11:42,339
Speaker 1: No you say oh, no No, I got a four on the AP calculus test you were going to make it.

191
00:11:42,641 --> 00:11:46,100
Speaker 1: You're going to give me credit for those calculus classes, so I don't have to pay you for them.

192
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,960
Speaker 0: I already already know that now different colleges have different requirements.

193
00:11:50,081 --> 00:11:58,540
Speaker 0: I mean so like if you're going in like if you're going into say Biology like you want to go pre-med you better have gotten a four or five on that AP biology tester.

194
00:11:58,601 --> 00:11:59,416
Speaker 0: They're not gonna count it.

195
00:11:59,789 --> 00:12:08,755
Speaker 0: Yeah But if you're going into computer science they'll probably take the three and let you not have to take a class even though I don't think they should because the three basically means you didn't really know your stuff.

196
00:12:09,157 --> 00:12:09,338
Speaker 1: Well.

197
00:12:09,378 --> 00:12:22,586
Speaker 0: It's like a see It's like normal you knew, but you didn't know really well Yeah But I got a three on the AP music theory test And I I'll admit openly that I knew jack all about music theory And I guessed almost every quest.

198
00:12:22,606 --> 00:12:23,409
Speaker 1: but you're not a moron.

199
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's anyway, so these things are great.

200
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,560
Speaker 1: Well, I think that is in multiple choice.

201
00:12:29,126 --> 00:12:34,738
Speaker 0: It's usually multiple choice But unless they've changed it the way it worked was you get like a point for every one.

202
00:12:34,758 --> 00:12:35,280
Speaker 0: you get right?

203
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,900
Speaker 0: But you lose points if you guess wrong as opposed to putting it black.

204
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:43,096
Speaker 1: So guessing won't get dressing on the whole thing won't get you a three unless you're really good at guessing.

205
00:12:43,216 --> 00:12:46,919
Speaker 0: and they also usually have Fairly extensive essay components, okay, okay?

206
00:12:47,281 --> 00:12:48,604
Speaker 0: Like the AP bio test.

207
00:12:48,684 --> 00:12:55,439
Speaker 0: actually one of the essays was like describe the procedure and the lab procedures and things you would use to clone a frog.

208
00:12:56,423 --> 00:12:57,748
Speaker 0: It was it was hardcore like that.

209
00:12:57,768 --> 00:13:01,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I actually set the record at RIT.

210
00:13:01,221 --> 00:13:07,253
Speaker 0: It was broken two years ago But I had the most AP credits coming into RIT of any student ever before.

211
00:13:07,394 --> 00:13:08,196
Speaker 1: how do you know that?

212
00:13:08,256 --> 00:13:09,340
Speaker 0: because they told me that?

213
00:13:10,381 --> 00:13:13,493
Speaker 0: Straight up when I transferred him in Wow how do you know is broken?

214
00:13:13,854 --> 00:13:15,360
Speaker 0: because then al Biles came to me later?

215
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:17,032
Speaker 0: He's like yeah, you broke the record.

216
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:23,524
Speaker 0: the record was 38 Uh-huh, and I had 41, but some kid got more than me a couple years ago Uh-huh, but anyway.

217
00:13:23,544 --> 00:13:24,286
Speaker 0: Yeah think about that.

218
00:13:24,587 --> 00:13:30,308
Speaker 0: I went into RIT with 41 credits complete mmm You take AP classes.

219
00:13:30,328 --> 00:13:33,100
Speaker 0: the tests are stupidly easy as long as you read the goddamn books.

220
00:13:33,542 --> 00:13:38,103
Speaker 0: But here's the story the College Board who kind of Administers the?

221
00:13:38,164 --> 00:13:39,268
Speaker 1: isn't it the AP board?

222
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:41,900
Speaker 0: well the College Board AP board same thing doesn't matter.

223
00:13:42,662 --> 00:13:46,253
Speaker 0: They have announced that they've gotten rid of the AP.

224
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,262
Speaker 0: computer science a B Exam.

225
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:50,345
Speaker 1: when you see you got a lot.

226
00:13:50,365 --> 00:13:51,529
Speaker 1: those letters are tricky.

227
00:13:51,569 --> 00:13:57,159
Speaker 1: those letters mean a lot cuz like in physics right this physics a physics B physics AB?

228
00:13:57,884 --> 00:14:03,394
Speaker 0: Well, there's no there's physics a a B There's also physics B, and there's physics BC, and then there's physics C.

229
00:14:03,555 --> 00:14:04,700
Speaker 1: All right that it goes up to C.

230
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:05,864
Speaker 0: I'll break it down.

231
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:10,059
Speaker 0: physics wise I know a lot about these because I actually got a lot of scholarships because of this.

232
00:14:10,621 --> 00:14:14,677
Speaker 0: Like I took all these classes, and I actually met with like representatives of the board and everything.

233
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:17,810
Speaker 0: the way It works is pretty much a is high school level.

234
00:14:18,112 --> 00:14:19,940
Speaker 0: like if you take the physics a test.

235
00:14:20,342 --> 00:14:23,360
Speaker 0: No college is gonna accept that for crap, and it's well.

236
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:23,983
Speaker 1: They'll let you.

237
00:14:24,304 --> 00:14:27,580
Speaker 1: they'll let you not have to take like basic physics.

238
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:32,679
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, if high school physics is a requirement in your college program, then that will get you out of high school physics.

239
00:14:32,719 --> 00:14:36,252
Speaker 0: basically That's like the physics you take in 10th or 11th grade mm-hmm.

240
00:14:36,312 --> 00:14:43,535
Speaker 0: the B. Level would be like Introductory college class like the basic physics class you would take in college.

241
00:14:43,815 --> 00:14:45,019
Speaker 0: is what the B test would be.

242
00:14:45,944 --> 00:14:47,618
Speaker 0: the C test is.

243
00:14:48,981 --> 00:14:57,903
Speaker 0: The C test that I took for physics involved double integration calculating the charge distributions on Surfaces.

244
00:14:57,963 --> 00:14:59,689
Speaker 1: why is it's thumping around?

245
00:14:59,830 --> 00:15:01,195
Speaker 0: it's not hurting you in any way.

246
00:15:01,215 --> 00:15:02,339
Speaker 1: It's thumping the whole room.

247
00:15:03,262 --> 00:15:05,016
Speaker 0: Okay, I guess you don't like my thumping.

248
00:15:05,218 --> 00:15:16,640
Speaker 0: no Anyway, the C test was literally like you had to use double integrals and things and figure out Electron distribution on complex three-dimensional surfaces in order to figure out like how much?

249
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,176
Speaker 0: Resistance upstream of some other kind of particle would be going over like.

250
00:15:20,196 --> 00:15:20,920
Speaker 0: it's crazy stuff.

251
00:15:21,322 --> 00:15:22,928
Speaker 0: It's more than most people ever bother with.

252
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:28,080
Speaker 1: I got a two on that test and stuff you honey You probably won't even do in college unless you go into physics.

253
00:15:28,301 --> 00:15:29,424
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I actually.

254
00:15:29,485 --> 00:15:34,140
Speaker 0: and now when they say like an AB or a BC that even gets more complicated like with calculus.

255
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:35,640
Speaker 0: The a test is like nothing.

256
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:40,360
Speaker 0: I don't know if they have an a test for calculus, but the there's the B, or there's the BC.

257
00:15:40,683 --> 00:16:00,199
Speaker 0: I don't think there's a straight-up C. If you take the B You took the B. if you take the C You took the C. but they also look at all the B level questions within the test and they give you a Subscore of what you would have gotten if you taking the B. So if you think you're smart, and you want to go for it You can take the harder test and not be dicked by that.

258
00:16:01,044 --> 00:16:03,205
Speaker 1: So they don't let you take the B And then the C separately.

259
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:04,169
Speaker 1: you can take the BC.

260
00:16:04,471 --> 00:16:11,840
Speaker 1: that way if you don't do well on the C But you didn't really well on the B. Then they're like okay Well, you know you got a four on the B and a two on the C. You're okay.

261
00:16:12,081 --> 00:16:13,728
Speaker 0: Yep, pretty much all right.

262
00:16:13,969 --> 00:16:18,427
Speaker 0: and but when it came to computer science I'm gonna tell you all straight up.

263
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:22,485
Speaker 0: the AP computer science test was Absolutely worthless.

264
00:16:22,625 --> 00:16:23,187
Speaker 0: it didn't?

265
00:16:23,849 --> 00:16:27,700
Speaker 0: it didn't involve anything that mattered at all ever and you wouldn't learn crap from it.

266
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:33,640
Speaker 1: Well the problem with the AP computer science test is really these tests are designed to go along with high school classes.

267
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:42,420
Speaker 1: Like you would take AP biology as a class in in high school and then at the end of that class You would take the test and that class was designed to prepare you for the test.

268
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,731
Speaker 0: There is usually would take the test without taking a class.

269
00:16:45,792 --> 00:16:49,080
Speaker 1: It was usually the hardest, you know class in school I mean in our school.

270
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:53,660
Speaker 1: It was pretty much you could take honors or you could take AP and AP was like above honors.

271
00:16:53,928 --> 00:17:00,390
Speaker 1: You know it was like the hardest class you could take and the school would even tell you don't take more than one AP class at A time because it's so hard.

272
00:17:00,552 --> 00:17:03,108
Speaker 0: I took like Actually, yeah my junior year.

273
00:17:03,128 --> 00:17:04,414
Speaker 0: I took five at the same time.

274
00:17:04,555 --> 00:17:20,282
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Yeah, so that the computer science thing is really tricky because most schools don't have computer science class Especially not an AP level one and even worse if you look at what the AP test covered It was.

275
00:17:20,303 --> 00:17:22,231
Speaker 0: it was just useless crap.

276
00:17:22,271 --> 00:17:23,474
Speaker 0: Like it wasn't anything that mattered.

277
00:17:23,496 --> 00:17:24,660
Speaker 1: it was never seen the test.

278
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:25,122
Speaker 1: So, I don't know.

279
00:17:25,162 --> 00:17:25,844
Speaker 1: I don't know about it.

280
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:30,460
Speaker 0: It's useless theoretical crap and nothing practical or useful in any way.

281
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,725
Speaker 0: I don't yeah, but

282
00:17:31,746 --> 00:17:46,527
Speaker 1: anyway, the point is is that you know having a computer science AP test without compute without worthwhile computer science classes in most of the schools Really never made a lot of sense and most of the people who would take it are people who learn Softer on their own, you know.

283
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:50,440
Speaker 1: and then would you know go and take this test in order to like get into a like.

284
00:17:50,541 --> 00:17:53,079
Speaker 1: You know a better, you know college or something like that.

285
00:17:53,621 --> 00:18:02,951
Speaker 0: The reason the main reason if you need an example of why the test was worthless if you went into RIT and IT or CS No, maybe if you got a five they wouldn't give you crap for that.

286
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,898
Speaker 1: RIT gave you something they wouldn't.

287
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:07,330
Speaker 1: for IT They put you into basically.

288
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:07,652
Speaker 0: Yeah.

289
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:08,014
Speaker 0: Yeah.

290
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, they didn't give you credit.

291
00:18:09,501 --> 00:18:16,111
Speaker 1: No, but instead of taking CS 1 2 3 4 you take like special CS 1 2 3 But you could take that anywhere if you wanted to no.

292
00:18:16,694 --> 00:18:17,720
Speaker 1: No, it was sort of like this.

293
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:20,840
Speaker 1: Well, you could but you had to like be you know accepted.

294
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:24,760
Speaker 1: It was like the sort of like the like the head start computer science program.

295
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:25,767
Speaker 1: It's like the same as your.

296
00:18:25,928 --> 00:18:26,532
Speaker 1: it was no different.

297
00:18:26,552 --> 00:18:27,680
Speaker 1: the degree was no different.

298
00:18:27,981 --> 00:18:33,889
Speaker 1: They just sort of like you had to take like a class or two less because it's like, okay You already know basic CS.

299
00:18:33,949 --> 00:18:34,734
Speaker 1: take these instead.

300
00:18:34,815 --> 00:18:35,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like an IT.

301
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:43,021
Speaker 0: Some people needed the class on how to SSH and how to use like a Linux prompt and the people who didn't need that could Skip it.

302
00:18:43,242 --> 00:18:43,483
Speaker 0: Yep.

303
00:18:43,624 --> 00:18:48,020
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this test is going away and they're only gonna have the a-level test now.

304
00:18:48,481 --> 00:18:51,292
Speaker 0: And I'm not sure what curriculum changes they've had over the years.

305
00:18:51,352 --> 00:18:55,306
Speaker 0: but looking through slashed out comments No one was ever impressed with this thing.

306
00:18:55,507 --> 00:18:59,019
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think a lot of the problem is just there really isn't enough.

307
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:11,442
Speaker 1: You know High school and below, you know computer science education in the country and I'm in the world actually and having it having such a high-level test is Really?

308
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:15,060
Speaker 1: Not a lot of people are gonna take it and even fewer people are gonna do well on it.

309
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,011
Speaker 0: The other problem is it's not like it's high-level.

310
00:19:17,031 --> 00:19:25,300
Speaker 0: Like if you study hard and learn it It'll be like a great boon to you because you'd be better off learning much more practical things before you get to school probably.

311
00:19:26,462 --> 00:19:30,840
Speaker 0: But I have a much larger rant about this that I'll save probably for a Thursday involving education.

312
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:32,469
Speaker 0: But suffice to say this is the news.

313
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:34,097
Speaker 0: and yes, I said suffice to say.

314
00:19:34,118 --> 00:19:36,185
Speaker 1: Yeah So check this out.

315
00:19:36,205 --> 00:19:37,249
Speaker 1: You probably heard this news.

316
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:41,461
Speaker 1: I'm checking what this people are all talking about the windows 7.

317
00:19:41,461 --> 00:19:43,108
Speaker 0: What is windows 7?

318
00:19:43,108 --> 00:19:46,100
Speaker 1: Well, it's it's obviously the windows that's gonna come after Vista.

319
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,687
Speaker 0: But what happened to window 6?

320
00:19:48,687 --> 00:19:49,228
Speaker 1: it was Vista.

321
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,956
Speaker 0: So what was Windows 5 XP?

322
00:19:52,197 --> 00:19:54,102
Speaker 0: So what was Windows 4?

323
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:55,688
Speaker 1: I guess me, right.

324
00:19:55,888 --> 00:19:56,671
Speaker 0: So what was Windows 3 98?

325
00:19:56,671 --> 00:20:01,242
Speaker 0: what happened to 2000?

326
00:20:01,242 --> 00:20:05,420
Speaker 0: Alright It doesn't matter I don't think anyone even really cares anymore.

327
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:17,154
Speaker 0: But there was like the windows track but then there was the NT that was separate and then eventually they got rid of the original Windows, I think that died out on me Yeah, and then like Windows 2000 XP was kind of based on 2000.

328
00:20:17,154 --> 00:20:18,620
Speaker 0: Vista is kind of like the next step there.

329
00:20:19,102 --> 00:20:25,217
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, the thing is is it's you know It's weird because it's like Vista hasn't?

330
00:20:25,761 --> 00:20:30,140
Speaker 1: The news all seems to be portraying Vista as like everyone hates it in an epic failure.

331
00:20:30,442 --> 00:20:37,332
Speaker 0: well, a lot of people say they hate it ever in my work is like yeah Vista sucks, but I Don't see any justification to be honest.

332
00:20:37,433 --> 00:20:44,939
Speaker 1: yet in all honesty The thing with Vista is that you know, it is a little bit annoying in the way You'd have to say okay a bunch of times, you know.

333
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:50,560
Speaker 1: But I mean, I guess it's easier to click Okay, then in Linux you to type in a whole password every time right plus.

334
00:20:50,680 --> 00:21:09,500
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a lot of the problems with Vista are not actually Vista's problems But they're the fact that most people who write software even professionals still write it incorrectly Like they don't even follow the rules that Microsoft puts forth to write good software Yeah, and everything needs to be run as administrator and all these problems and they're not really Vista's fault.

335
00:21:09,582 --> 00:21:16,640
Speaker 0: It's more that Microsoft has let people get away with writing crap for so long that people are still writing crap But now Vista doesn't deal with it so well.

336
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:25,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean Vista is you know, I've used it and really it's no better than XP But it's not really worse either.

337
00:21:25,281 --> 00:21:35,040
Speaker 1: It's just sort of the same with some flash and you know, not Adobe Flash But you know like polish, you know visual polish and some extra features here and there and some such like that.

338
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,870
Speaker 1: And you know, it's like people like oh, it's terrible.

339
00:21:37,891 --> 00:21:40,280
Speaker 1: I don't really I mean it's the same.

340
00:21:40,582 --> 00:21:42,080
Speaker 1: It's like pick whichever one you want.

341
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:47,200
Speaker 0: I think part of the reason for this is that a lot of people remember the ME thing and ME was an abortion.

342
00:21:47,342 --> 00:21:48,600
Speaker 0: That was just a disaster.

343
00:21:48,823 --> 00:21:50,060
Speaker 1: It was quite the disaster.

344
00:21:50,401 --> 00:21:56,560
Speaker 0: ME was an awful awful operating system and it nothing good came of it and everyone realized it right away.

345
00:21:56,660 --> 00:21:58,227
Speaker 0: It was pretty much maligned continuously.

346
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:03,525
Speaker 0: I think a lot of people are free maturely ME-izing Windows Vista.

347
00:22:03,846 --> 00:22:05,209
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean it.

348
00:22:05,851 --> 00:22:06,573
Speaker 1: I really you know.

349
00:22:06,633 --> 00:22:09,160
Speaker 1: Vista's not anything to you know, write home about.

350
00:22:09,160 --> 00:22:15,616
Speaker 1: It's not fantastic or great But you know, the media is really portraying it as like an epic failure when it's just sort of like a bleh.

351
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:29,280
Speaker 0: I mean, I think part of the problem though, is that because computing is just advancing and evolving XP if you look at purely a technological Standpoint is not obsolete yet and works just fine.

352
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:38,584
Speaker 0: It's not like before where Windows 98 didn't work and Windows 2000 was clearly better to the point that you could not Not upgrade.

353
00:22:38,604 --> 00:22:42,620
Speaker 0: you needed Windows 2000 same with between Windows 95 and Windows 98.

354
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:47,694
Speaker 0: I mean 95 didn't deal well with USB let alone a million other things.

355
00:22:47,694 --> 00:22:49,719
Speaker 0: 98 was a thousand times better.

356
00:22:50,503 --> 00:22:52,538
Speaker 0: XP is a thousand times better.

357
00:22:53,081 --> 00:22:59,520
Speaker 0: Vista is just the same thing and the only reason you'd have to upgrade is because they're not going to support XP anymore.

358
00:22:59,861 --> 00:23:12,628
Speaker 1: Yep, but they you know, I guess because of all the you know, the bad press about Vista, you know Microsoft seems to be in sort of a rush to get out Windows 7 and I don't know what's gonna cover this.

359
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:20,680
Speaker 1: it is it you know, because they still have all these issues the Antitrust and they're you know, really as much as the antitrust was appropriate back in the day.

360
00:23:21,325 --> 00:23:23,100
Speaker 1: I really don't think it's appropriate anymore.

361
00:23:23,742 --> 00:23:36,920
Speaker 1: I mean with Apple and Linux are very viable software wise and if Microsoft manages to stay on top With that kind of competition, I don't think it's because of any sort of monopoly that needs to be you know regulated.

362
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,110
Speaker 1: It's because they're you know doing something.

363
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:41,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, but everyone likes to hate Microsoft.

364
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:46,340
Speaker 1: They just they still love to hate Microsoft even though really I'm starting to see more and more.

365
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:56,402
Speaker 0: I mean, I remember I don't really remember this too much but there was a time when Microsoft was the awesome guy the underdog the guy who's doing all the awesome and IBM was the Evil.

366
00:23:56,482 --> 00:23:56,983
Speaker 0: horrible.

367
00:23:57,324 --> 00:24:00,132
Speaker 0: fuck IBM those bastards with their bla bla bla.

368
00:24:00,733 --> 00:24:06,640
Speaker 0: and then as Microsoft became successful everyone decided Microsoft blah and yay Google and now a lot.

369
00:24:06,921 --> 00:24:13,979
Speaker 0: I'm starting to see this slow trend where a lot of people are really really sour on Google Despite the fact that Google's making the same Austin they've always made.

370
00:24:14,181 --> 00:24:17,438
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you start you're seeing lots of Apple hate going around too.

371
00:24:17,499 --> 00:24:20,335
Speaker 1: Of course It's just still the Apple fanboys haven't gone anywhere either.

372
00:24:20,355 --> 00:24:25,740
Speaker 0: Yeah Apple fanboys are unique because there aren't Google fanboys like there are Apple fanboys.

373
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:27,873
Speaker 0: Apple did that very well.

374
00:24:27,973 --> 00:24:28,194
Speaker 1: Yeah.

375
00:24:28,215 --> 00:24:29,943
Speaker 1: Oh This is just.

376
00:24:30,687 --> 00:24:32,856
Speaker 1: you should be aware of it because it's like.

377
00:24:32,896 --> 00:24:38,657
Speaker 1: well, you know I don't think it's worth it to go and buy Vista now if there's gonna be a Windows 7 next year.

378
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:43,454
Speaker 0: I'll put it this way if you buy a new computer and it comes with Vista great.

379
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:45,944
Speaker 0: Don't bother downgrading XP There's no reason to.

380
00:24:46,566 --> 00:24:55,620
Speaker 0: but don't pay unless you have shit that doesn't work with Vista Which could could happen but almost everything works with Vista except anything computer associates wrote because they can't program with the dam.

381
00:24:56,207 --> 00:24:57,118
Speaker 0: But I digress.

382
00:24:58,425 --> 00:25:09,440
Speaker 0: But anyway, yeah don't pay to upgrade because Windows 7 is gonna come out and then you're probably gonna want that because it's probably Going to have a lot of the stuff that was supposed to be in Vista except they rushed it out the door.

383
00:25:09,741 --> 00:25:21,380
Speaker 1: I think really Microsoft problem as a whole is they've had this, you know this plan of you know, okay Well upgrade Windows every so many years and then there's you know, mostly security fixes not really feature updates.

384
00:25:21,701 --> 00:25:27,018
Speaker 0: Windows 2000 is still largely usable except for the fact that you can't get updates to it anymore.

385
00:25:27,038 --> 00:25:32,173
Speaker 1: for security Yeah, I mean and like XP what features have they added to XP since it started?

386
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:34,319
Speaker 1: not much except for security updates and ie7.

387
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:39,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's still mostly as far as anyone can tell the same kernel the same basic functionality.

388
00:25:40,162 --> 00:25:47,415
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean they you know, they might have had some performance tweaks and security tweaks But they haven't changed, you know the features for the users that much at all.

389
00:25:47,897 --> 00:25:57,798
Speaker 1: So it's like You know that you look at Linux and look at OS X and they're just sort of constantly or at least more Constantly updating the features at least for the user.

390
00:25:57,858 --> 00:26:02,740
Speaker 1: I mean New OS X is in terms of how long it there was between XP and Vista.

391
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:11,280
Speaker 1: There were like two or three new OS X versions that had a significant You know the apples all like check out our leopard over a bajillion new features, you know.

392
00:26:11,542 --> 00:26:20,494
Speaker 1: And while a lot of those features are just sort of nothing There are a lot of new features in the leopard versus the tiger New features in the Vista versus the XP.

393
00:26:20,514 --> 00:26:26,500
Speaker 1: Oh It's shiny Sidebar.

394
00:26:27,781 --> 00:26:28,906
Speaker 1: It's a little more secure.

395
00:26:28,926 --> 00:26:32,600
Speaker 0: I'll admit I like the sidebar, but there's no reason they couldn't have put that in XP.

396
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,872
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could run that as an application.

397
00:26:35,073 --> 00:26:35,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know right?

398
00:26:35,797 --> 00:26:38,184
Speaker 1: So it's like What are the new features?

399
00:26:38,284 --> 00:26:39,046
Speaker 1: but you know Linux.

400
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:46,270
Speaker 1: new features every week new features every hour as people are constantly writing new software And as soon as they write it, it's open source.

401
00:26:46,290 --> 00:26:48,520
Speaker 1: So as soon as they write the feature you have the feature.

402
00:26:48,601 --> 00:26:49,860
Speaker 1: No waiting, you know.

403
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:57,343
Speaker 1: It's just you get if using the Ubuntu hearty beta you're getting daily updates like constantly with all sorts of crazy shit That's going on.

404
00:26:57,764 --> 00:27:05,600
Speaker 1: It's and there's new buttons every six months, you know, we're talking about, you know Vista took how many years five six seven years forever?

405
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:19,780
Speaker 1: So yeah Well see maybe I think if they come out with Windows 7 next year and they do pull it off somehow Maybe it'll start like a you know, sort of an annual Windows update thing, you know And I think that would actually be a much better strategy for them.

406
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:27,382
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's like we're gonna actually update the features of Windows every year Windows 7 8 9 10, you know Something like that.

407
00:27:28,386 --> 00:27:29,089
Speaker 1: I think that would do them.

408
00:27:29,129 --> 00:27:31,919
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, I mean, it's it's just it's really tricky.

409
00:27:32,523 --> 00:27:35,019
Speaker 1: Can I think well look Linux Unix etc?

410
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:41,744
Speaker 1: I've had virtual desktops right for how many years since like the 70s almost even in XP I gotta end Vista.

411
00:27:41,764 --> 00:27:43,288
Speaker 0: I got to use a power tool or something.

412
00:27:43,509 --> 00:27:44,091
Speaker 0: multiple desktop.

413
00:27:44,171 --> 00:27:55,518
Speaker 1: OS X just added virtual desktops Aka spaces in the newest version that came out less than a year ago something which Linux Unix Etc has had for at least a decade if not two, right?

414
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,586
Speaker 1: Windows still doesn't have it.

415
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:00,140
Speaker 1: Vista still does not have this basic feature.

416
00:28:00,702 --> 00:28:03,109
Speaker 1: It's like a mandatory feature still not in this.

417
00:28:03,169 --> 00:28:05,396
Speaker 0: how long did it take for IE to get tabs?

418
00:28:06,078 --> 00:28:06,640
Speaker 1: I know right?

419
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:14,901
Speaker 0: But things of the day.

420
00:28:15,424 --> 00:28:16,810
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try something again.

421
00:28:16,910 --> 00:28:22,045
Speaker 0: I did this a while ago where I had my own personal kind of theme week with things of the day.

422
00:28:22,065 --> 00:28:28,206
Speaker 0: You might remember I had Hitler was born to be alive week, which was kind of awesome.

423
00:28:28,266 --> 00:28:29,049
Speaker 0: I thought yeah.

424
00:28:30,131 --> 00:28:37,146
Speaker 0: But anyway, this one is much more coherent and I actually kind of have something relevant and poignant to say at the end But I got to get through all of it.

425
00:28:37,631 --> 00:28:47,969
Speaker 0: So all of my things of the day this week will be related to something that you've probably heard many times But like most people you probably didn't actually know what it was.

426
00:28:48,835 --> 00:28:51,130
Speaker 1: There's a song or at least all the full history.

427
00:28:51,331 --> 00:28:54,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, or in the very least you didn't know the name of the song or anything.

428
00:28:54,551 --> 00:28:57,247
Speaker 0: But as soon as you hear it you go, oh that song.

429
00:28:57,307 --> 00:28:57,790
Speaker 0: I remember that.

430
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:58,493
Speaker 0: I know that song.

431
00:28:58,534 --> 00:29:02,872
Speaker 1: you did a really bad job of trying to portray what song it was Sing.

432
00:29:02,912 --> 00:29:04,017
Speaker 0: what do you want from me?

433
00:29:04,398 --> 00:29:07,150
Speaker 0: besides those were the days my friend?

434
00:29:07,450 --> 00:29:10,240
Speaker 0: We thought they'd never and that see that's totally off.

435
00:29:10,782 --> 00:29:13,030
Speaker 0: That's kind of how it's sung by a lot of people.

436
00:29:13,171 --> 00:29:15,822
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's not the way you sang it.

437
00:29:15,862 --> 00:29:17,650
Speaker 1: there did not, you know did not help me.

438
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:19,899
Speaker 1: But as soon as I saw the video I was like, oh that song.

439
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:22,330
Speaker 0: How would you sing it a lot slower?

440
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:23,071
Speaker 0: Try it.

441
00:29:23,111 --> 00:29:23,674
Speaker 0: I'm curious.

442
00:29:24,096 --> 00:29:24,799
Speaker 1: I don't say do it.

443
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:25,101
Speaker 1: Do it.

444
00:29:25,161 --> 00:29:25,904
Speaker 1: That's not gonna happen.

445
00:29:26,085 --> 00:29:26,969
Speaker 0: Ah, you're a shit talker.

446
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,520
Speaker 1: I didn't say I could do it.

447
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,305
Speaker 1: I just said you couldn't.

448
00:29:29,547 --> 00:29:29,869
Speaker 1: yeah.

449
00:29:30,652 --> 00:29:34,227
Speaker 0: Anyways when you hear some of the other things of the day I've got.

450
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,030
Speaker 0: you'll see what I was doing.

451
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:49,160
Speaker 0: But anyway, so this song those were the days Once upon a time there was a time where we used to raise a glass or two.

452
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:56,125
Speaker 1: Remember how we laughed away the hour.

453
00:29:57,546 --> 00:30:00,510
Speaker 1: think of all the great things we would do.

454
00:30:04,421 --> 00:30:14,625
Speaker 0: Those were the days my friend we thought they'd never And we'd sing and dance forever.

455
00:30:14,906 --> 00:30:27,040
Speaker 0: and a day We'd live the life we choose we'd fight and never lose For we were young and sure to have our way.

456
00:30:28,481 --> 00:30:30,528
Speaker 0: Now you're probably thinking oh, yeah that song.

457
00:30:30,990 --> 00:30:34,180
Speaker 0: well the history of this song is actually kind of interesting.

458
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:37,310
Speaker 0: I stumbled upon a music video to it that I'm not.

459
00:30:37,330 --> 00:30:38,855
Speaker 0: this is what I'm saving for the end.

460
00:30:38,916 --> 00:30:43,389
Speaker 0: that the reason I'm doing this Week, but I look like oh, yeah that song.

461
00:30:43,510 --> 00:30:44,713
Speaker 0: Oh those people performed it.

462
00:30:45,255 --> 00:30:46,278
Speaker 0: Oh, so do these people?

463
00:30:46,298 --> 00:30:46,980
Speaker 0: I wondered about us.

464
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:52,499
Speaker 0: I did a little research and There's kind of a really interesting thread that almost comes full circle here.

465
00:30:53,021 --> 00:31:08,486
Speaker 0: So this song those were the days was written by Gene Raskin a long time ago and While it was first played by some band called the Limelighters who also apparently played another fairly famous song first well before Anyone else was playing it.

466
00:31:08,506 --> 00:31:25,740
Speaker 0: It was performed by a woman named Mary Hopkin in 1968. now Mary Hopkin and her little single album was produced by none other than Paul McCartney and Funnily enough the b-side of this album was actually turn turn turn which was made famous by the birds.

467
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,144
Speaker 0: It was actually a really great song

468
00:31:27,324 --> 00:31:27,545
Speaker 1: yep,

469
00:31:27,966 --> 00:31:42,858
Speaker 0: but this song which became super popular worldwide especially in Britain My first thing of the day I'm linking here is actually the the first kind of music video to this song by Mary Hopkin Which is back when music videos were a lot different from what they are now.

470
00:31:44,181 --> 00:31:50,929
Speaker 0: but the cool thing is the song was actually a Translation of a much older song.

471
00:31:51,311 --> 00:32:00,539
Speaker 0: I'm gonna butcher this Cyrillic here, but Dorogoy Delignoyu that yeah Russian Russian Russian Delignoyu Delignoyu.

472
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:08,173
Speaker 0: There's oh, I can't say an O and then a U without anyway But this was written by Boris Foreman.

473
00:32:08,254 --> 00:32:12,589
Speaker 0: I can say that in the bodies Boris Foreman in the kind of...

474
00:32:12,609 --> 00:32:13,973
Speaker 1: watch out for the moose and squirrel...

475
00:32:14,174 --> 00:32:23,897
Speaker 0: in early 1900s, but That song was actually based on a poem by Konstantin Podrevsky.

476
00:32:24,283 --> 00:32:25,319
Speaker 0: Alright, alright.

477
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:43,460
Speaker 0: I don't know if he actually wrote the lyrics to it or if it was based on the song based on the poem directly But anyway, so this old Russian folk song or poem was turned into a very popular song in the late 60s by someone who also on their b-side happened to have turn turn turn.

478
00:32:44,002 --> 00:32:57,959
Speaker 0: So my things of the day are the original 1968 Mary Hopkin rendition and The best video I could find of the actual Russian version Mm-hmm, and I guarantee that this will get much more interesting later in the week.

479
00:32:58,924 --> 00:33:08,380
Speaker 1: Alright, so there's this artist right in Canada I think and I think it's Canada anyway, and he took an old Buick, right?

480
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:15,573
Speaker 1: but he took all this shit out of it like the engine and all that the stuff right and He changed it into a car.

481
00:33:15,613 --> 00:33:24,188
Speaker 1: That's you know, it's like, you know You got a Wildwood or some vacation place and they have those sort of multiple like people bicycle things But it's not like a bicycle.

482
00:33:24,208 --> 00:33:25,979
Speaker 1: It's like a little car, but everyone pedals.

483
00:33:26,763 --> 00:33:29,960
Speaker 1: He sort of turned this real car into a pedal car like the Flintstones.

484
00:33:30,542 --> 00:33:33,114
Speaker 1: So four people sit in the car two in the front two in the back.

485
00:33:33,375 --> 00:33:36,727
Speaker 1: the driver steers this brakes like little you know hand brakes.

486
00:33:36,887 --> 00:33:44,084
Speaker 1: one brake does the left two tires and the right brake does the right two tires and it's got drums and It's a pedal car.

487
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:48,020
Speaker 1: It's a full-size Buick frame, but it's a pedal car, right?

488
00:33:48,481 --> 00:33:51,058
Speaker 1: And it's you know, it's sort of like this great, you know work of art.

489
00:33:51,118 --> 00:33:54,802
Speaker 1: in a way it was actually in like a gallery and stuff because it's like The.

490
00:33:55,023 --> 00:34:01,080
Speaker 1: we have the contrast of the giant monstrosity of a Buick with the you know, the pedaling, you know.

491
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:02,411
Speaker 1: It's kind of like aha, right?

492
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:08,656
Speaker 1: So These four people are hanging out with the artist or something and they they borrowed the car.

493
00:34:08,676 --> 00:34:11,692
Speaker 1: Oh They drove around Toronto with it.

494
00:34:12,094 --> 00:34:14,648
Speaker 0: That's kind of awesome right, you know I used to.

495
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:19,998
Speaker 1: it can go like 15 miles an hour and It's it's you know, the brakes work and whatever.

496
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:29,574
Speaker 1: Hey, the thing is they the car is actually was driven around Manhattan at one point I believe but they drove it around Toronto and they got pulled over.

497
00:34:29,594 --> 00:34:30,900
Speaker 1: they got pulled over and they got a ticket.

498
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,284
Speaker 0: What was the ticket for?

499
00:34:32,304 --> 00:34:36,074
Speaker 1: I think like driving an unsafe vehicle or something bullshit.

500
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:37,800
Speaker 1: operating an unsafe vehicle.

501
00:34:38,061 --> 00:34:41,219
Speaker 0: I have a feeling that that vehicle is perfectly safe for all involved.

502
00:34:41,460 --> 00:34:42,043
Speaker 1: So they went.

503
00:34:42,063 --> 00:34:45,418
Speaker 1: they also had no license plates or anything, but okay that I can understand why they're.

504
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,424
Speaker 0: no But it's a bite.

505
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:47,670
Speaker 1: It's basically a bicycle.

506
00:34:47,731 --> 00:34:49,079
Speaker 1: bicycles need license plates.

507
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:59,120
Speaker 1: ha right, so they went to court and They won but if this is the thing of the day because of all the funny things that made them win.

508
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:04,235
Speaker 1: For example instead of headlights they had two little tea lights, you know, the little little candles.

509
00:35:04,335 --> 00:35:05,217
Speaker 1: Ooh, right?

510
00:35:05,619 --> 00:35:16,099
Speaker 1: So I Think there was an argument that was like the guy in courts that he said What would happen if a lit candle hit another car?

511
00:35:16,780 --> 00:35:18,902
Speaker 0: nothing They're.

512
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:22,411
Speaker 1: also there were also such funny lines as oh, yes.

513
00:35:22,491 --> 00:35:24,858
Speaker 1: The car is so dangerous going 15 miles an hour.

514
00:35:25,902 --> 00:35:26,689
Speaker 1: Oh good lord.

515
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,799
Speaker 1: What if it hit somebody?

516
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:30,724
Speaker 1: You know, they're like.

517
00:35:30,925 --> 00:35:32,128
Speaker 1: this car isn't dangerous.

518
00:35:32,188 --> 00:35:39,540
Speaker 1: all the other cars are dangerous and that's sort of like the artistic message Of it is like, you know, but yeah, you should check this out.

519
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:44,520
Speaker 1: There's a video of them being pulled over and and all sorts of funny lines from court and such.

520
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,206
Speaker 1: But I think they won.

521
00:35:46,768 --> 00:35:48,695
Speaker 1: it's it's a it's a victory for all.

522
00:35:49,076 --> 00:35:54,115
Speaker 0: but moving on to the main bit We're getting kind of bored with doing this kind of alternating ITC s thing.

523
00:35:54,155 --> 00:35:55,099
Speaker 0: at least for the time being.

524
00:35:56,126 --> 00:35:59,913
Speaker 0: We haven't gotten any Feedback at all from you people.

525
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:00,899
Speaker 0: if you like this or not.

526
00:36:01,341 --> 00:36:03,388
Speaker 0: So, I guess we're gonna stop it temporarily.

527
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:05,414
Speaker 0: if you liked it say something.

528
00:36:06,257 --> 00:36:10,169
Speaker 0: if you didn't like it Say you didn't like it and we won't do it again anytime soon.

529
00:36:10,189 --> 00:36:11,152
Speaker 1: Yeah, I know.

530
00:36:11,192 --> 00:36:14,060
Speaker 1: It's like Scott's box got so much feedback.

531
00:36:14,222 --> 00:36:21,616
Speaker 1: well because your box is so Anyway, which means I think I got to keep doing it or change it maybe but this is getting no feedback.

532
00:36:21,656 --> 00:36:25,107
Speaker 0: the ITC s Alternating and we know you're all listening.

533
00:36:25,268 --> 00:36:26,232
Speaker 0: So I don't know.

534
00:36:26,353 --> 00:36:26,654
Speaker 0: I don't know.

535
00:36:26,674 --> 00:36:27,457
Speaker 0: Is this useful to you?

536
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:28,040
Speaker 0: Do you care?

537
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:29,620
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

538
00:36:29,941 --> 00:36:37,500
Speaker 0: I was debating what to talk about tonight because a lot of the topics I have are very very specific or very very esoteric.

539
00:36:38,085 --> 00:36:41,706
Speaker 1: Mmm, you got to find the the in-between So I think I'm just gonna.

540
00:36:41,806 --> 00:36:45,740
Speaker 0: I kind of want to talk a little bit about the overview of not really IT security.

541
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:52,680
Speaker 0: But you know how you see like on TV or in a movie like hackers movie where Penn Jillette was actually in there.

542
00:36:53,081 --> 00:37:06,317
Speaker 0: You see like this big data center full of computers and there's like that guy Who's sitting at a console surrounded by a hundred monitors with colors and everything and he's watching the network And when the hackers come in, this is skulls

543
00:37:06,417 --> 00:37:06,780
Speaker 1: everywhere

544
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:12,390
Speaker 0: He's the one fighting the hackers and yelling and screaming and calling people on the phone and be like Did you get those firewalls up?

545
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,020
Speaker 0: Cuz the cookie monsters breaking through?

546
00:37:16,941 --> 00:37:20,780
Speaker 1: And meanwhile, there's like a skull coming across his monitor and that it explodes.

547
00:37:20,901 --> 00:37:28,840
Speaker 0: Ah Man, I've said this before but hackers the movie and the craft were the exact same movie.

548
00:37:29,181 --> 00:37:34,340
Speaker 0: The craft was what a Wicca wish Wicca was and hackers was what hackers wish hacking was.

549
00:37:35,042 --> 00:37:37,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, man, if hacking was like that.

550
00:37:37,368 --> 00:37:40,156
Speaker 1: Well, it's what hacker wannabes wish hacking.

551
00:37:40,236 --> 00:37:41,420
Speaker 0: I wish hacking was that way.

552
00:37:41,662 --> 00:37:42,369
Speaker 1: Well, you're a wannabe.

553
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:43,017
Speaker 1: You're not a hacker.

554
00:37:44,068 --> 00:37:44,654
Speaker 0: I've had what.

555
00:37:44,674 --> 00:37:45,159
Speaker 1: have you had?

556
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:47,551
Speaker 0: When I was in the kitty wannabe?

557
00:37:50,402 --> 00:37:51,708
Speaker 0: I'm talking more about the common.

558
00:37:51,728 --> 00:37:52,612
Speaker 0: Look at that culture.

559
00:37:52,773 --> 00:37:54,320
Speaker 1: Could you own anyone at Def Con?

560
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,403
Speaker 1: No, you could not own.

561
00:37:55,523 --> 00:37:57,992
Speaker 0: could you get own anyone at Def Con?

562
00:37:58,294 --> 00:38:00,060
Speaker 1: It would take me a lot longer than those guys.

563
00:38:00,241 --> 00:38:10,880
Speaker 0: I'm talking more about what if I could actually Hack the sprinkler system at my school to go off whenever I wanted to without using the simple method of lighting a fire under it?

564
00:38:11,120 --> 00:38:14,350
Speaker 1: That's that's the the that's actually hacking.

565
00:38:14,771 --> 00:38:17,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I know but I wish it were like the movies.

566
00:38:17,703 --> 00:38:25,472
Speaker 0: Anyway Of course the matrix got it right when she SSH You know, that's all we saw and everyone lost their shit about.

567
00:38:25,813 --> 00:38:26,636
Speaker 0: she typed SSH.

568
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:27,379
Speaker 0: It's real hacking.

569
00:38:27,459 --> 00:38:29,167
Speaker 1: OMG not really, but what?

570
00:38:29,188 --> 00:38:38,301
Speaker 0: yeah, but anyway, so Those things the kind of console of the guy sitting there yelling and screaming with a million monitors Don't?

571
00:38:38,742 --> 00:38:41,131
Speaker 0: they exist more than you might realize.

572
00:38:41,211 --> 00:38:43,900
Speaker 0: but I think I need to say that they're not quite like that.

573
00:38:44,281 --> 00:38:53,180
Speaker 1: They're not like the movies but there are places where there are people with lots of screens Monitoring what's going on on the internets and other networks?

574
00:38:53,600 --> 00:39:09,660
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna talk about kind of a few levels of network monitoring because the easiest one the biggest one is kind of the big iron knock the Network Operations Center like the kind of thing that the super gigantic company has and They actually do look a lot like what you saw in hackers.

575
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,546
Speaker 0: The only real difference is that one.

576
00:39:12,068 --> 00:39:15,480
Speaker 0: usually the people paid to watch those screens are not super technical people.

577
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,815
Speaker 0: They're basically just people hired to watch the screens and call someone else if something changes color.

578
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:20,397
Speaker 1: Yep.

579
00:39:20,678 --> 00:39:27,960
Speaker 1: They're also You know, so they can be pretty impressive, but they usually have less fancy graphics and more boring information.

580
00:39:28,181 --> 00:39:30,108
Speaker 0: But they look like in terms of setup.

581
00:39:30,128 --> 00:39:32,558
Speaker 0: They're often the same like you'll have this wall of monitors.

582
00:39:32,638 --> 00:39:35,855
Speaker 0: at IBM we actually had a wall of monitors.

583
00:39:36,097 --> 00:39:42,384
Speaker 0: there were like 20 monitors and each one had a different thing on it and all these statuses and things everywhere.

584
00:39:42,645 --> 00:39:51,453
Speaker 0: and we had these more centralized monitors and then we had in the back a full replica of like the setup in one of the remote sites and then another replica of the setup locally.

585
00:39:51,754 --> 00:39:59,920
Speaker 0: so we could like go there to diagnose problems without having to go out to sites and all this crazy stuff, but We there were no 3d skulls.

586
00:40:00,221 --> 00:40:05,560
Speaker 0: There were green boxes that turned orange or yellow or red depending on if something was going wrong.

587
00:40:05,961 --> 00:40:16,740
Speaker 0: After possibly paging someone yep, and if if you knew about a problem you turned it dark green to say yes I'm working on it and other people could look and say oh, yeah, that's dark green rim must be working on it.

588
00:40:16,981 --> 00:40:18,867
Speaker 1: I mean a lot of those operation centers.

589
00:40:18,927 --> 00:40:23,020
Speaker 1: Well, you know, they have their uses most places right for monitoring.

590
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:24,926
Speaker 1: They basically just have all the tech.

591
00:40:24,946 --> 00:40:29,560
Speaker 1: people have blackberries or whatever and if something goes wrong the computers are.

592
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,867
Speaker 1: You know There are other computers that watch.

593
00:40:32,128 --> 00:40:36,182
Speaker 1: so it's like their computers watching the other computers and if they see something Go wrong.

594
00:40:36,423 --> 00:40:39,151
Speaker 1: They send someone an email that says hey something went wrong.

595
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:40,897
Speaker 0: Well, see the tricky part there.

596
00:40:40,937 --> 00:40:41,238
Speaker 0: Is that in?

597
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:51,749
Speaker 0: As far as I have seen the vast majority of companies in the United States have effectively no network monitoring Whatsoever or very little.

598
00:40:52,010 --> 00:40:59,360
Speaker 0: I'm talking not think the vast majority That think about all the businesses and beacon that have some computers networks and an internet connection.

599
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:02,397
Speaker 0: They have Nothing watching their.

600
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:03,363
Speaker 1: no They got nothing.

601
00:41:03,705 --> 00:41:07,220
Speaker 0: and think about even most like mechanics and like higher up like the car dealerships there.

602
00:41:07,821 --> 00:41:11,030
Speaker 0: It's doubtful that they have much watching their network.

603
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:12,734
Speaker 0: If anything, they don't think they really need.

604
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:14,820
Speaker 1: they pretty much care working or not working there.

605
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:17,285
Speaker 0: Well that then does brings up.

606
00:41:17,366 --> 00:41:19,933
Speaker 0: there are two basic kinds of network monitoring.

607
00:41:20,334 --> 00:41:24,910
Speaker 0: and see I'm really gonna try to only talk about the Overview and I'm I'm not gonna talk about SNMP.

608
00:41:24,991 --> 00:41:26,437
Speaker 0: Oh IDs or anything scary.

609
00:41:26,979 --> 00:41:33,288
Speaker 0: So Basically you can break down network monitoring into two categories proactive and reactive.

610
00:41:33,631 --> 00:41:36,849
Speaker 0: now you might think oh Well, obviously everyone should have proactive like.

611
00:41:36,889 --> 00:41:37,772
Speaker 0: that's the right solution.

612
00:41:37,812 --> 00:41:41,246
Speaker 0: and reactive is kind of like what you do If you don't know better or you're poor.

613
00:41:41,286 --> 00:41:44,800
Speaker 1: No, no proactive is more like only for really serious business.

614
00:41:45,181 --> 00:41:47,911
Speaker 0: Well, it's more that it's a matter of cause-benefit like.

615
00:41:47,951 --> 00:41:50,179
Speaker 0: take the example of the people watching the system.

616
00:41:51,586 --> 00:42:03,960
Speaker 0: if you look at the money at cost to set up a Sophisticated smart system that will monitor other systems Determine what's wrong determine who to page and only page those people and apply logic.

617
00:42:04,885 --> 00:42:11,991
Speaker 0: It's actually a lot cheaper to set up a much cheaper reactive solution and then hire someone at near minimum wage to watch it.

618
00:42:12,312 --> 00:42:16,164
Speaker 0: and then they have a book that says if this turns red call this person.

619
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:21,175
Speaker 0: if this turns red call this person and As a result and even beyond that.

620
00:42:22,224 --> 00:42:24,016
Speaker 0: Well, maybe I should clarify a little bit.

621
00:42:24,036 --> 00:42:30,058
Speaker 0: actually explain Proactive means I have systems that are monitoring my systems polling.

622
00:42:30,098 --> 00:42:30,700
Speaker 0: They're active.

623
00:42:30,941 --> 00:42:32,266
Speaker 0: It's kind of like the active sonar.

624
00:42:32,587 --> 00:42:37,825
Speaker 0: I ping all my servers and I have a system that looks and says well I pinged the production server.

625
00:42:37,925 --> 00:42:38,507
Speaker 0: It's still up.

626
00:42:38,908 --> 00:42:40,252
Speaker 0: Well, I pinged the backup server.

627
00:42:40,332 --> 00:42:40,874
Speaker 0: It's still up.

628
00:42:41,215 --> 00:42:42,880
Speaker 0: Well, I pinged the development box.

629
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:44,568
Speaker 0: I pinged it again.

630
00:42:44,588 --> 00:42:45,714
Speaker 0: Ah shit.

631
00:42:45,754 --> 00:42:46,980
Speaker 0: The development box is down.

632
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:50,715
Speaker 0: Better page rim to come fix it.

633
00:42:50,735 --> 00:42:53,267
Speaker 0: Oh Rim didn't respond to the page.

634
00:42:53,327 --> 00:42:54,071
Speaker 0: I'll page him again.

635
00:42:54,272 --> 00:42:55,899
Speaker 0: Oh, he didn't respond to the page.

636
00:42:55,939 --> 00:42:59,539
Speaker 0: still I'm paging his manager and telling him that rim didn't respond to the page.

637
00:43:00,842 --> 00:43:03,455
Speaker 1: We must be in the shitter possibly or I don't care.

638
00:43:03,475 --> 00:43:05,584
Speaker 0: No it depends.

639
00:43:05,885 --> 00:43:21,760
Speaker 0: it's tricky because there's a fine line with proactive monitoring between monitoring effectively and knowing when things go down and Information overload where I get paged when someone visits my website and I get paged.

640
00:43:21,983 --> 00:43:34,626
Speaker 0: someone leaves my website and I get paged when I get an email and I get paged when Bob gets an email and I get paged when an Email bounces and I get paged when a bit comes in in a page when another bit comes in Page when that bit finishes coming in.

641
00:43:35,188 --> 00:43:52,051
Speaker 0: you can go way overboard with monitoring and it'll get to the point where Even if you're monitoring everything in the world So much information is coming in that even if you have very smart people in your knock if you get a thousand traps You know in an hour How are you gonna know which ones matter and which ones don't?

642
00:43:52,673 --> 00:43:54,380
Speaker 0: and if you're getting traps that don't matter?

643
00:43:55,180 --> 00:43:56,464
Speaker 0: Why even send the traps?

644
00:43:56,765 --> 00:43:57,206
Speaker 0: you're doing it.

645
00:43:57,226 --> 00:43:58,249
Speaker 0: You're not gaining anything.

646
00:43:58,289 --> 00:44:00,155
Speaker 0: that level of monitoring is not helping you.

647
00:44:00,175 --> 00:44:01,780
Speaker 0: No, not really now.

648
00:44:02,660 --> 00:44:11,839
Speaker 0: reactive monitoring is what most people use where Basically you don't so much monitor the systems but at the highest end you wait for traps.

649
00:44:11,879 --> 00:44:25,700
Speaker 0: now I'm not gonna explain that in detail but there is a way with something called SNMP the simple network management protocol where a Computer or a device can send out a trap if something goes wrong like say I've got a router.

650
00:44:25,780 --> 00:44:44,615
Speaker 0: You know like your links this router and say I want it'll I set it up So that if it loses a connection on one of the ports the port that I know goes out to the internet It'll send a trap to my monitoring machine that says hey I lost ten internet and if the internet comes back, it'll send another trap saying hey

651
00:44:44,796 --> 00:44:45,418
Speaker 1: I has

652
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:50,917
Speaker 0: an internet Mm-hmm, so then I could set it up to where the system receives that trap and it goes.

653
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:52,885
Speaker 0: All right The internet is down.

654
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:53,709
Speaker 0: I know this.

655
00:44:53,970 --> 00:44:58,313
Speaker 0: I'm gonna wait five minutes if in those five minutes I have not received a trap saying it's back up.

656
00:44:58,394 --> 00:44:59,260
Speaker 0: I'm gonna pay trim.

657
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:01,631
Speaker 0: Now that's a reactive solution.

658
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,200
Speaker 0: I'm not pulling actively.

659
00:45:03,602 --> 00:45:07,400
Speaker 0: I'm getting the divine of relying on the device to tell me something's wrong.

660
00:45:07,862 --> 00:45:08,506
Speaker 1: If this what if the?

661
00:45:08,606 --> 00:45:10,578
Speaker 1: what if the router breaks and it loses the Internet's?

662
00:45:10,759 --> 00:45:18,990
Speaker 0: yes If the if I don't get the trap because both interfaces went down or the router caught fire Unless I have a fire trap that comes in.

663
00:45:19,010 --> 00:45:21,300
Speaker 0: and there's actually a funny story about that.

664
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:27,600
Speaker 0: I got a trap once at IBM from an old device that effectively said the device is on fire.

665
00:45:27,941 --> 00:45:36,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, it did not actually mean that but that is what it said And much hilarity ensued as we tried to figure out if that was actually what was happening.

666
00:45:37,381 --> 00:45:41,150
Speaker 0: But anyway, so at its highest level that is reactive monitoring.

667
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:45,140
Speaker 0: on its lowest level is you kind of you don't monitor at all.

668
00:45:45,641 --> 00:45:49,955
Speaker 0: But you might have kind of a system status thing that says like it's up.

669
00:45:50,015 --> 00:45:50,356
Speaker 0: It's down.

670
00:45:50,416 --> 00:45:52,184
Speaker 0: It doesn't page doesn't do anything It's just there.

671
00:45:52,687 --> 00:45:54,480
Speaker 0: Maybe it's on a big screen in the knock.

672
00:45:54,902 --> 00:46:02,170
Speaker 0: maybe you have a system where you can just SSH in and see if it's up and You don't care until a customer calls and says hey rim.

673
00:46:02,190 --> 00:46:04,358
Speaker 0: I can't get to your website you go.

674
00:46:04,538 --> 00:46:06,346
Speaker 0: Oh Let me look into that.

675
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:06,888
Speaker 0: Yep.

676
00:46:06,928 --> 00:46:08,636
Speaker 0: The website's down up.

677
00:46:08,756 --> 00:46:09,600
Speaker 0: I see why it's down.

678
00:46:09,640 --> 00:46:11,326
Speaker 0: I'm gonna fix it and that's.

679
00:46:11,386 --> 00:46:12,831
Speaker 0: that's the kind of monitoring gig nights has.

680
00:46:12,871 --> 00:46:15,440
Speaker 0: we have purely customer based reactive monitoring.

681
00:46:15,983 --> 00:46:18,560
Speaker 0: We don't know if front row crew comm is down.

682
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:27,638
Speaker 0: We don't care if it's and as we are the customers which we are occasionally Yes, but if it goes down pretty much within a couple minutes all of you bastards email us.

683
00:46:27,779 --> 00:46:28,220
Speaker 0: Hey, it's down.

684
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:29,346
Speaker 0: Hey, it's down is coming back up.

685
00:46:29,507 --> 00:46:30,351
Speaker 0: I can't get to the forum.

686
00:46:30,532 --> 00:46:30,874
Speaker 0: Are you guys?

687
00:46:30,935 --> 00:46:31,337
Speaker 0: Okay?

688
00:46:31,498 --> 00:46:31,900
Speaker 0: Are you dead?

689
00:46:33,761 --> 00:46:38,044
Speaker 0: so in a way you guys kind of act as our Reactive monitoring.

690
00:46:38,668 --> 00:46:40,920
Speaker 1: that's good because I don't have an extra computer to devote to that.

691
00:46:41,161 --> 00:46:46,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I mean beyond that really the idea of network monitoring much like the idea of any kind of monitor.

692
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,723
Speaker 0: You know terrorist monitoring if you're the government or intelligence monitoring The.

693
00:46:51,044 --> 00:46:55,240
Speaker 0: the thing you really need to think about is that and the thing that IT people are paid to think about.

694
00:46:55,981 --> 00:46:57,379
Speaker 0: What information do I need?

695
00:46:58,163 --> 00:47:00,633
Speaker 0: What business impact am I trying to avert?

696
00:47:00,714 --> 00:47:17,080
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah rim It's great that you're monitoring the mp3 server for the office and you get a priority one critical page if the mp3 server goes Down, but it'd really be nice if you notice that the database server that our production database is on went down like five times yesterday.

697
00:47:17,684 --> 00:47:19,539
Speaker 0: I'm glad that you didn't pay attention to that.

698
00:47:20,001 --> 00:47:25,057
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you kind of have to think about your core business and I talked about this before.

699
00:47:25,097 --> 00:47:30,413
Speaker 0: but IT Unless you are an IT company is not your business.

700
00:47:30,433 --> 00:47:31,757
Speaker 0: IT makes the business go.

701
00:47:31,778 --> 00:47:42,380
Speaker 0: so monitoring if the switches are at 80% or 90% efficiency is not nearly as important as Monitoring if you're a production web server database is up or not.

702
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:44,580
Speaker 1: Yeah It's like if your company sells apples.

703
00:47:45,102 --> 00:47:49,460
Speaker 1: The number one thing is you want to make sure that apples are always able to be bought and sold.

704
00:47:49,821 --> 00:48:03,865
Speaker 1: You might you know have some monitoring that tells you that you know some Apple, you know, it has Apple computers a bad way That some computer over somewhere is going slower than it could be or something else is kind of funky over to the left or to the right.

705
00:48:03,926 --> 00:48:09,859
Speaker 1: but if Apples if the buying and selling of apples is in danger that is priority number one.

706
00:48:10,982 --> 00:48:11,925
Speaker 0: And then you can't see.

707
00:48:12,427 --> 00:48:18,369
Speaker 0: you think about what you need for your business to continue going How much money you could lose if it's not running?

708
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:22,040
Speaker 0: and then how long would you be willing to wait before someone fixes it?

709
00:48:22,521 --> 00:48:27,100
Speaker 0: And depending on the answers to all those questions You have a much better idea of all right?

710
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:32,557
Speaker 0: Well, I need we need all of our engineers to be paged 24/7 if this goes down because we're screwed.

711
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:35,611
Speaker 0: if that goes down Everything else can wait until the morning.

712
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:36,980
Speaker 0: We don't even need to page.

713
00:48:37,201 --> 00:48:42,479
Speaker 0: We'll just have a status page that everyone checks in the morning to see if hey, it's all pay It's not up and we can fix it whenever.

714
00:48:43,023 --> 00:48:55,916
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, and I don't want to go in any more detail because SNMP and network monitoring solutions and all those things are incredibly complicated, but I guess suffice to say I think you get the gist of it.

715
00:48:56,158 --> 00:48:57,865
Speaker 0: and Starting next week.

716
00:48:57,885 --> 00:49:01,000
Speaker 0: We're gonna go back to our normal regularly scheduled Monday geek nights.

717
00:49:01,421 --> 00:49:04,430
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll do a tech news roundup or something to start it off again.

718
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:05,814
Speaker 1: No, that's not.

719
00:49:05,995 --> 00:49:06,376
Speaker 0: we'll see.

720
00:49:06,436 --> 00:49:07,580
Speaker 0: if anyone has a suggestion.

721
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:10,388
Speaker 0: Monday calendars pretty much open.

722
00:49:10,710 --> 00:49:12,377
Speaker 0: the first good suggestion we get will do.

723
00:49:12,397 --> 00:49:34,522
Speaker 0: yeah I'm kind of thinking I wanted because I was reminded again because periodically people find old internet things for myself and Scott and I kind of want to do a show about The old stuff on the internet that comes back to haunt people and funny websites you put up when you were 14 that are now funny in a different way when you're 25 Plus.

724
00:49:34,602 --> 00:49:36,567
Speaker 0: actually, I think there's a lot of interesting things about that.

725
00:49:36,587 --> 00:49:39,836
Speaker 0: because think about it where the first generations are coming up.

726
00:49:40,036 --> 00:49:44,817
Speaker 0: imagine political elections and political issues 20 years from now.

727
00:49:45,341 --> 00:49:55,899
Speaker 0: The only way to have a candidate who didn't do something embarrassing on the internet at some point is to groom Political candidates from birth on and make sure that they never have a myspace ever.

728
00:49:56,424 --> 00:50:03,163
Speaker 0: Yep, and in that case maybe we'll have some sort of case system where there are people who are born to be politicians and no one else can ever be one.

729
00:50:03,204 --> 00:50:06,045
Speaker 0: or maybe our Expectations of politicians will.

730
00:50:06,165 --> 00:50:07,850
Speaker 1: maybe you should save it for an episode.

731
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:08,031
Speaker 1: That's.

732
00:50:08,051 --> 00:50:08,893
Speaker 0: maybe I will.

733

Speaker 0: does that sound interesting?

734
00:50:10,077 --> 00:50:11,060
Speaker 0: should we do it next week?

735
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,358
Speaker 1: It's better than nothing?

736
00:50:13,161 --> 00:50:13,744
Speaker 0: Yeah, nothing.

737
00:50:14,306 --> 00:50:16,114
