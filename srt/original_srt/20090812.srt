00:00:39,553 --> 00:00:40,679
Speaker 1: We're doing like two panels at it.

11
00:00:41,122 --> 00:00:42,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, just bang bang.

12
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:42,855
Speaker 1: and then what anime?

00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,745
Speaker 0: Anyway, Boston's next year.

15
00:00:45,805 --> 00:00:46,467
Speaker 0: It's not this year.

16
00:00:46,488 --> 00:00:48,194
Speaker 1: Yeah, so don't have much to do.

17
00:00:48,214 --> 00:00:52,353
Speaker 0: I guess finally relax I guess not that's that's kind of interesting.

18
00:00:52,393 --> 00:00:52,614
Speaker 0: Wow.

19
00:00:52,996 --> 00:00:56,558
Speaker 0: Oh con season But wait Pax is coming, isn't it?

20
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,823
Speaker 1: Yeah, Pax is coming.

21
00:00:57,863 --> 00:01:02,540
Speaker 1: the schedule for Pax West was just put online and you can see our three panels.

22
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,747
Speaker 1: We're not gonna talk about it much.

23
00:01:03,807 --> 00:01:05,920
Speaker 1: But obviously we're doing three panels at Pax.

24
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:09,999
Speaker 1: We talked about it a lot in the last couple of shows and we'll talk about it before Pax.

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:10,842
Speaker 0: The thing is funny.

26
00:01:10,862 --> 00:01:21,074
Speaker 0: Django con which I probably won't go to but I might if work takes care of it for me is You know because Pax is Friday Saturday Sunday, then Monday is Labor Day.

27
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:28,498
Speaker 0: Django con is Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday Nah in Portland, so it's like I go to the west coast of Seattle then have to get.

28
00:01:28,578 --> 00:01:34,180
Speaker 0: if I did it I have to go to Portland from Seattle and then stay there for into and then come home like Friday.

29
00:01:34,702 --> 00:01:36,188
Speaker 1: So one thing that's interesting though.

30
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,216
Speaker 1: Pax is starting at like 10 a.m.

31
00:01:38,276 --> 00:01:39,179
Speaker 1: On Friday this year.

32
00:01:40,621 --> 00:01:44,498
Speaker 0: Start early on Friday instead of starting super late like they usually do.

33
00:01:44,518 --> 00:01:46,447
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I don't know if it was usually.

34
00:01:46,507 --> 00:01:49,560
Speaker 1: I never really looked at the time schedule until the year we went last year.

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,173
Speaker 0: So I also I want to make a note that just an interesting note of something I discovered.

36
00:01:53,233 --> 00:01:58,960
Speaker 0: right you discover Pax mails out the badges But I found out they don't mail them to Canada, huh?

37
00:02:00,443 --> 00:02:00,886
Speaker 0: I don't think they.

38
00:02:00,906 --> 00:02:02,499
Speaker 0: I think they only mail them to US people.

39
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,429
Speaker 1: Well, they don't mail them to people like us either.

40
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,480
Speaker 1: Remember we have to go to that special like register.

41
00:02:07,163 --> 00:02:07,986
Speaker 0: The thing is going to.

42
00:02:08,006 --> 00:02:11,280
Speaker 0: that special place is gonna be cool because all the other special people are gonna be there.

43
00:02:11,561 --> 00:02:15,080
Speaker 1: It still amazes me that I mean the fact that I have like the same badge as MC front a lot.

44
00:02:15,181 --> 00:02:20,294
Speaker 1: It's like I could walk up to him be like hey, man We're peers and he could laugh at me and then we could go about our lives.

45
00:02:20,535 --> 00:02:22,301
Speaker 0: He's ten times our talent I know.

46
00:02:22,321 --> 00:02:26,115
Speaker 1: All right, so it's definitely one of those people who was put in his 10,000 hours, right?

00:02:26,135 --> 00:02:30,876
Speaker 0: So Let's you got to go to work because this is your night work week.

58
00:02:55,266 --> 00:02:58,760
Speaker 0: Okay, so check this out right a while back.

59
00:02:59,824 --> 00:03:02,404
Speaker 0: You know, there's a. What's his name?

60
00:03:02,826 --> 00:03:04,673
Speaker 0: Oh Todd McFarlane, you know Todd McFarlane, right?

61
00:03:04,693 --> 00:03:06,340
Speaker 0: Yes the spawn guy, right?

62
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,157
Speaker 0: The thing is he hasn't actually made comics in since 2000 forever, right?

63
00:03:11,698 --> 00:03:14,720
Speaker 0: So Robert Kirkman, who's the walking dead?

64
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:16,545
Speaker 0: Guy, right?

65
00:03:16,646 --> 00:03:18,454
Speaker 0: He went to at some convention.

66
00:03:18,534 --> 00:03:19,740
Speaker 0: It was it was like a famous thing.

67
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:27,260
Speaker 0: He went up and he was like Todd McFarlane, you know, I'm making you all this money with my walking dead image comics, right?

68
00:03:27,481 --> 00:03:30,408
Speaker 0: He's like you haven't made a comic in forever.

69
00:03:30,428 --> 00:03:35,220
Speaker 0: I'll write a comic and you draw it and the guy was like, okay, right?

70
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,273
Speaker 0: So just in this, you know, most recent previews catalog.

71
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:42,480
Speaker 0: So I guess coming out in two months from now.

72
00:03:42,620 --> 00:03:42,962
Speaker 0: So what's?

73
00:03:43,103 --> 00:03:43,767
Speaker 0: it's August.

74
00:03:43,787 --> 00:03:46,240
Speaker 0: so in October, you know, what's coming out?

75
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,787
Speaker 1: Haunt number one on number one.

76
00:03:49,807 --> 00:03:55,724
Speaker 0: So haunt is if you don't know it's basically a spider-man ripoff of Todd McFarlane's from back in the day.

77
00:03:55,744 --> 00:04:00,800
Speaker 0: It's basically spider-man with sort of a black costume with jizz all over it, right?

78
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:04,814
Speaker 0: It's not even drawn by Todd McFarlane.

79
00:04:04,854 --> 00:04:05,740
Speaker 0: He only inked it.

80
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:11,740
Speaker 0: He didn't do the rest of the art not the colors of the page only doing the inking and it's written by Kirkman.

81
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:20,387
Speaker 0: So everyone pretty much saw it and was like really we had that big he'd be stood up and he challenged him at a convention Like draw comic again.

82
00:04:20,487 --> 00:04:22,213
Speaker 0: See what you can do and that's what he wrote.

83
00:04:22,334 --> 00:04:23,920
Speaker 0: and then he comes up with this piece of shit.

84
00:04:24,061 --> 00:04:27,140
Speaker 0: So it's just sort of funny how things work out that way.

85
00:04:27,222 --> 00:04:27,900
Speaker 0: I think you know.

86
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,293
Speaker 0: I think it's pretty obvious by now that Todd McFarlane is the guy who.

87
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:33,903
Speaker 0: I don't think he just cares about Comics that much.

88
00:04:33,943 --> 00:04:40,098
Speaker 0: I think he just cares about, you know business and money more so but you know, that's who he is whatever.

89
00:04:41,383 --> 00:04:43,015
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess I won't read it.

90
00:04:43,499 --> 00:04:46,029
Speaker 0: Yeah I'll show you the cover.

91
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,018
Speaker 0: those you can lol at it.

92
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:53,224
Speaker 0: If you yeah go online and search for like haunt comic or like go to image comics website and look for haunt It's.

93
00:04:53,425 --> 00:05:01,936
Speaker 0: uh, hi Larry is when you see this cover It's basically the same cover Todd McFarlane's drawn a thousand times before in his life.

94
00:05:03,103 --> 00:05:20,935
Speaker 1: So Kagoshima to get tourism and that sort of thing and also probably for respect and nostalgia is having a new Galaxy Express 999 short made but the short is 999 seconds long and will premiere on September 9th 2009.

95
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:23,429
Speaker 0: I Mean that's cool and all.

96
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,240
Speaker 0: but I mean, is it really gonna be good?

97
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,340
Speaker 0: I mean, it's probably gonna be much better.

98
00:05:27,702 --> 00:05:34,540
Speaker 0: Well more well animated because it's only a short and it's made in modern times But it's just a short and it's made for advertising purposes.

99
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,833
Speaker 0: I don't think this is something I really need to run out and see.

100
00:05:36,854 --> 00:05:37,095
Speaker 1: well.

101
00:05:37,135 --> 00:05:40,080
Speaker 1: at the same time though It looks like they've got all the right ducks in line.

102
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:45,000
Speaker 1: I mean, obviously there is some love here because one you know wrote it the same guy did hakaba ki taro.

103
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,824
Speaker 0: I like that guy.

104
00:05:45,864 --> 00:05:48,536
Speaker 1: I trust that guy Yoshimi not finish that freakin show.

105
00:05:48,556 --> 00:05:51,253
Speaker 0: Yeah Why don't they bring that manga out here?

106
00:05:51,273 --> 00:05:51,756
Speaker 0: That's a manga.

107
00:05:51,797 --> 00:05:53,485
Speaker 0: I'll buy Are you?

108
00:05:53,566 --> 00:05:55,240
Speaker 0: are you listening Viz or whoever?

109
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:03,313
Speaker 1: But also to celebrate the 30th anniversary of Galaxy Express 3 9 They're going to be showing a remastered version of it in Japan.

110
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,000
Speaker 0: Are you the tea of the movie?

111
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,605
Speaker 1: I'd love a TV show.

112
00:06:06,645 --> 00:06:13,014
Speaker 1: I guess the whole TV show 100 and it just says Galaxy Express 3 9 anime to mark the film's 30th anniversary.

113
00:06:13,034 --> 00:06:14,540
Speaker 0: I assume that's the movie.

114
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:15,886
Speaker 0: They said film is the movie.

115
00:06:16,046 --> 00:06:19,280
Speaker 1: Okay, but they're getting the original voice cast and everything for this thing.

116
00:06:19,562 --> 00:06:20,752
Speaker 0: Maybe we should get that.

117
00:06:20,812 --> 00:06:21,780
Speaker 0: I want to know I got it.

118
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:24,591
Speaker 0: We got to get like that remastered DVD when it comes out.

119
00:06:24,892 --> 00:06:26,940
Speaker 1: I'm sure we'll be able to get it in some capacity.

120
00:06:27,081 --> 00:06:27,847
Speaker 0: Yeah, that'd be awesome.

121
00:06:28,169 --> 00:06:28,874
Speaker 1: It is scary though.

122
00:06:28,894 --> 00:06:38,580
Speaker 1: looking at this picture I don't know if it's from the short or not but Tetsuro is pretty on model in the first episode of Galaxy Express and pretty much gets more and more and more off model as the

123
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,574
Speaker 0: Tetsuro is drawn differently in all these in all the like in the movies.

124
00:06:42,855 --> 00:06:44,020
Speaker 0: He's drawn very normal.

125
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:48,879
Speaker 1: He's not like a potato head or but in this picture here is definitely potato head, but the eyes are lined up.

126
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:50,995
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, they're almost the same size.

127
00:06:51,016 --> 00:06:59,870
Speaker 0: the TV show He's a potato head, but he's sort of even still normal and like in some of the series like That I've seen like he's drawn.

128
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:06,371
Speaker 0: He's like missing a lump like they don't Properly at all and and he's totally acts like.

129
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:09,760
Speaker 0: so, you know, it's like there's all these multiple different characters.

130
00:07:09,861 --> 00:07:14,110
Speaker 0: They all call them all Tetsuro But you know only some of them are good and some of them are.

131
00:07:14,371 --> 00:07:21,557
Speaker 1: see while his character is consistent in the actual anime He definitely gets more and more off model throughout the show and then kind of comes back on model at the end.

132
00:07:21,758 --> 00:07:30,626
Speaker 1: Yeah Yeah, it's just weird to see how him having two reasonably similarly sized eyes that are almost lined up with each other Wait, wait, do you see him in the movie?

133
00:07:30,686 --> 00:07:31,650
Speaker 1: I've seen him in the movie.

134
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:32,493
Speaker 0: He's completely different.

135
00:07:32,533 --> 00:07:34,179
Speaker 1: It's not Tetsuro at some other guy.

136
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:45,240
Speaker 1: Anyway, but as far as I can tell that's all the anime news.

137
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:53,303
Speaker 1: I mean, I didn't really want to talk about the fact that for kids is losing money hand over fist But it's not news.

138
00:07:53,504 --> 00:07:54,628
Speaker 1: anime is not really on TV.

139
00:07:54,668 --> 00:07:56,133
Speaker 0: So what are they gonna do?

140
00:07:56,153 --> 00:07:59,284
Speaker 0: Yeah, thanks to the three-year-old news Okay.

141
00:07:59,324 --> 00:08:02,015
Speaker 1: Anyway, well the fact that they lost money is actually new news.

142
00:08:02,055 --> 00:08:03,180
Speaker 1: They weren't losing money before.

143
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:05,565
Speaker 0: It's not a surprise.

144
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:09,600
Speaker 0: It's like if you didn't if you didn't know that was coming then I don't know what to say.

145
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:12,509
Speaker 1: No It's more that it's sad that anime is just not like.

146
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:16,143
Speaker 1: no one's pushing it anymore in the US and the whole industry is just Collapsing.

147
00:08:16,204 --> 00:08:17,370
Speaker 0: what what's new about that?

148
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:17,973
Speaker 0: Nothing.

149
00:08:18,395 --> 00:08:19,420
Speaker 0: It's it's been around.

150
00:08:19,822 --> 00:08:22,740
Speaker 1: It's like okay, but I thought geek nights was commentary not news.

151
00:08:22,881 --> 00:08:26,044
Speaker 1: You can always get the news a lot sooner than you'll get it from us Especially before.

152
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:29,500
Speaker 0: but everyone has already said everything there is to say about the collapsing anime industry.

153
00:08:30,601 --> 00:08:32,708
Speaker 0: Not only is it not new there is nothing new to say.

154
00:08:32,808 --> 00:08:35,600
Speaker 0: It's all been said anime dead end of story.

155
00:08:35,922 --> 00:08:36,525
Speaker 0: What you gonna do?

156
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:37,871
Speaker 1: All right, you got a thing of the day.

157
00:08:38,193 --> 00:08:39,259
Speaker 0: Oh, I do have a thing of the day.

158
00:08:39,927 --> 00:08:54,400
Speaker 0: So, you know Rob Liefeld the guy everyone likes to make fun of for not being able to draw feeder hands and making people who are entirely too muscly and Putting lots and lots of pouches and belts on all the x-men and such.

159
00:08:54,982 --> 00:08:57,050
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it was also Jim Lee doing that.

160
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,520
Speaker 0: but regardless that Rob Liefeld, right?

161
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:05,140
Speaker 0: You know, he's you know, despite you know, what you whether you think of his arts good or bad, right?

162
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:07,252
Speaker 0: And obviously he can't draw feet.

163
00:09:07,272 --> 00:09:08,660
Speaker 0: There's no question about that, right?

164
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:11,867
Speaker 0: You know, he still goes to conventions.

165
00:09:11,908 --> 00:09:12,851
Speaker 0: He still has fans.

166
00:09:12,891 --> 00:09:16,084
Speaker 0: He still makes stuff, you know, and from what I hear I've never met him.

167
00:09:16,104 --> 00:09:17,792
Speaker 0: He's not really a bad person.

168
00:09:17,852 --> 00:09:19,159
Speaker 0: He's just you know, he is who he is.

169
00:09:19,822 --> 00:09:25,039
Speaker 0: So some kids, you know thought they would be all cool and they went and they were at.

170
00:09:25,099 --> 00:09:31,000
Speaker 0: you know They saw that Rob Liefeld was there and they you know were like, you know, but they were all wussy fanboys, right?

171
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,187
Speaker 0: They didn't have the balls to like.

172
00:09:32,207 --> 00:09:32,912
Speaker 0: just go up to him.

173
00:09:32,932 --> 00:09:34,099
Speaker 0: be like you suck, right?

174
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:36,819
Speaker 0: So they were just sort of like hey, what's going on?

175
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:50,640
Speaker 0: right, but then they were they were around the comic convention and they saw for sale an old copy of How to draw comics the Marvel Way, oh man, that's that's semi infamous, right?

176
00:09:50,700 --> 00:10:05,480
Speaker 0: so they bought it for like five or ten bucks and They because you know, it's not an expensive book and they basically wrote like instead of you know Handing it to him be like hey, man I think you could really use this, you know, like I'm like someone with balls would do right?

177
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,498
Speaker 0: They basically wrote a note in the back.

178
00:10:08,001 --> 00:10:13,883
Speaker 0: They like set it down in his table and like tapped it with their hand a few times and ran away like little girlies Really?

179
00:10:13,903 --> 00:10:23,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, so, you know a lot of people on the internet were like, you know Even though they might you know, not be be Liefeld fans and make fun of them all the time on the Internet's.

180
00:10:24,301 --> 00:10:26,536
Speaker 0: They were all like hey, that's not cool man, right?

181
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:33,604
Speaker 0: You know, like you shouldn't be going insulted and people like that blah blah blah, but I was like, hey That was cool.

182
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:37,500
Speaker 0: But the part there wasn't cool was not that they were insulting him.

183
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:40,020
Speaker 0: It was that they insulted him like pussies, right?

184
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:43,380
Speaker 0: If you want to insult the man you got to go up and you know do it, right?

185
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:46,540
Speaker 0: I mean like imagine if you are at a convention, I got to do it cleverly.

186
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:54,635
Speaker 1: You've got to have like the the one-two punch the exactly the punch it has to be and it has to be the insult That is given with a little bit of love

187
00:10:54,756 --> 00:11:04,760
Speaker 0: exactly like if I'm sitting there at the geek night's table at some convention right and someone comes up and like puts Podcasting for dummies on the table like taps it a few times and run and walks away like a wuss.

188
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:08,053
Speaker 0: I'll just be like what the fuck they just give me a free book.

189
00:11:08,616 --> 00:11:09,700
Speaker 0: What are they trying to advertise?

190
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,359
Speaker 0: I'm just like what the fuck is going on, right?

191
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:17,120
Speaker 0: But if they come up and they'd be like, you know, hey, I really think you could use this.

192
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:24,982
Speaker 0: I'd be like, oh man laws that I'd you know I'd be shaking their hand to get a picture with them and you know, I'd sign the book for whatever, you know It'd be.

193
00:11:25,263 --> 00:11:27,654
Speaker 0: it'd be a good times if they had balls, right?

194
00:11:27,675 --> 00:11:35,359
Speaker 0: Because I wouldn't take it all You know angrily as some people might but you know, this is a is an example of how not to be right.

195
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,844
Speaker 0: This is why this is my thing of the day.

196
00:11:36,925 --> 00:11:38,008
Speaker 0: Don't be this guy.

197
00:11:38,169 --> 00:11:41,500
Speaker 1: Don't do what Donny don't doesn't do exactly either.

198
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:48,740
Speaker 0: Don't insult people or insult them with you know balls, even if you're a girl, you know, not necessarily balls.

199
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,605
Speaker 1: I think panache is what you really need.

200
00:11:50,666 --> 00:11:53,012
Speaker 1: that too and a little bit of hutzpah.

201
00:11:53,153 --> 00:11:58,971
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's those are all related to the testicle The virtual testicles not the physical ones.

202
00:11:59,212 --> 00:12:01,825
Speaker 1: So I think this is really cool And hopefully you will too.

203
00:12:01,845 --> 00:12:05,240
Speaker 1: and if you think this is not cool watch it before you pass judgment.

204
00:12:05,822 --> 00:12:06,022
Speaker 0: Why?

205
00:12:06,042 --> 00:12:10,997
Speaker 0: if you think if you don't think this is cool, then you're not qualified to be geek nights listener.

206
00:12:11,217 --> 00:12:14,620
Speaker 1: very simply Cars have something called a differential gear.

207
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:15,829
Speaker 1: It's how they can turn.

208
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,259
Speaker 1: and if you don't understand why?

209
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:24,440
Speaker 1: This video explains better and in more concisely and more directly than anything I've ever seen in my life.

210
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:30,620
Speaker 1: It is just they take the concept and they boil it down to its fundamental in a way that anyone anyone could understand.

211
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:34,060
Speaker 1: And this is from the 30s, I I don't know.

212
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:46,440
Speaker 1: it's kind of weird to watch this kind of explanation of something and then I look at all the kind of like how-to's and Explanations of things you see on YouTube and on how stuff works today, and they're just not nearly as elegant.

213
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:54,300
Speaker 0: Maybe we should make a series of how-to videos about modern ultra modern things But make them in this style with that narration and a black and white video.

214
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:01,705
Speaker 1: Of course part of the problem is that a differential gear, you know You know.

215
00:13:01,765 --> 00:13:16,795
Speaker 1: once you know the concept the engineering part of it's pretty straightforward, but now Many things are not conceptually simple let alone Engineering Lee simple and the yeah like the fundamental concept of a lot of engineering feats today Alone would take an entire lifetime to understand fully.

216
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:21,740
Speaker 0: Yeah It's just the way of the world, but you know, I think this is actually you know.

217
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:26,079
Speaker 0: The coolest thing about this video I think is you by watching it you see how much effort they put into it.

218
00:13:26,481 --> 00:13:35,951
Speaker 0: Like look how many different gears they made to show you the progression from the concept like Lincoln log tinker toy Differential up to the real deal, you know, it was.

219
00:13:36,292 --> 00:13:40,284
Speaker 0: you know, it's like wow, they could have made like three But they made like ten Whatever.

220
00:13:40,506 --> 00:13:41,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, we need more videos like this.

221
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:49,145
Speaker 1: So if anyone knows of any let me know because I got to point out that there are a bunch of related videos that are all just terrible Simulations our explanation.

222
00:13:49,165 --> 00:13:54,458
Speaker 0: Yeah, I almost feel like if I had a video like this for every part of the car I could be a mechanic just watching them all I'd be done.

223
00:13:54,802 --> 00:13:56,700
Speaker 0: I wouldn't have to go to mechanic school or anything.

224
00:13:57,562 --> 00:14:00,671
Speaker 1: The thing is it's one thing to know how a differential works.

225
00:14:01,012 --> 00:14:03,600
Speaker 1: It's another thing to unlock a locked differential.

226
00:14:04,384 --> 00:14:04,867
Speaker 0: This is true.

227
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:14,780
Speaker 0: All right, so let's You decided that because you're working nights and such and because we didn't really read or watch much in common.

228
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,450
Speaker 1: Yep, basically Scott's reading a lot of comics.

229
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,160
Speaker 1: I'm watching a lot of anime and we're not linking up.

230
00:14:21,042 --> 00:14:23,060
Speaker 0: Not really not linking up very much at all.

231
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,057
Speaker 0: So maybe we are gonna do a show that consists entirely of geek bites.

232
00:14:27,539 --> 00:14:37,136
Speaker 1: one thing I got to say though that while I'm watching and doing a lot of stuff right now What I want to be watching is basically ghost in the shell standalone complex, but I've already seen that.

233
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:40,789
Speaker 0: I have already seen that Yes, but I keep it like every time I watch anime.

234
00:14:40,829 --> 00:14:46,800
Speaker 1: I just think I want some sort of sci-fi Procedural every time there's a new anime season, right?

235
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:51,008
Speaker 0: I look at all the shows that are listed and I'm like man Like I don't like.

236
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:55,681
Speaker 0: I don't really want to watch any of them Right, or at least I don't have a strong feeling for any of them I'm.

237
00:14:55,701 --> 00:14:59,796
Speaker 0: the only show that I'm really looking for is like standalone complex third gig.

238
00:14:59,877 --> 00:15:00,760
Speaker 0: That's what I'm looking for.

239
00:15:01,464 --> 00:15:02,328
Speaker 0: It's like where is that?

240
00:15:02,489 --> 00:15:03,455
Speaker 0: That's what I want to see.

241
00:15:03,555 --> 00:15:04,279
Speaker 0: more shit like that.

242
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:09,176
Speaker 1: Well thing is I mean Michio and Hachin and I guess Gurren Lagann's him already going back.

243
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:11,341
Speaker 0: Yeah What?

244
00:15:11,622 --> 00:15:14,877
Speaker 1: yeah, how can you not be except both of those shows are fantastic.

245
00:15:15,259 --> 00:15:17,949
Speaker 1: Yeah Alright, so what are you doing?

246
00:15:18,009 --> 00:15:18,251
Speaker 1: Mr.

247
00:15:18,453 --> 00:15:19,380
Speaker 1: Never watches anime.

248
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:28,391
Speaker 0: I finished watching all a hundred and thirteen episodes of the galaxy express 3 9 TV show Which I think puts me in a very exclusive club of people have seen all 113 episodes.

249
00:15:28,411 --> 00:15:29,575
Speaker 0: I've seen a little under half.

250
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:34,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, now how many people in the entire history of the world?

251
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:35,833
Speaker 0: Do you think I've seen all 113?

252
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:36,515
Speaker 0: Well good for you.

253
00:15:38,563 --> 00:15:39,137
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 0: You should probably watch that but no I have also Let's see if I watched any other a nimes at all.

257
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:49,312
Speaker 1: No you haven't.

258
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:50,035
Speaker 1: you don't do anything.

259
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:54,472
Speaker 0: No, I didn't watch any a Not any nimes that I can remember.

260
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:58,670
Speaker 0: I've you know, but I'm about to watch Boca rata which is a show that I put off.

261
00:15:59,172 --> 00:16:00,820
Speaker 1: Ah, you're putting that off for so long.

262
00:16:00,921 --> 00:16:01,263
Speaker 1: I've see.

263
00:16:01,283 --> 00:16:03,379
Speaker 1: I watched that show like over a year ago.

264
00:16:03,540 --> 00:16:05,611
Speaker 0: It was in the queue and now it came up in the queue.

265
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,526
Speaker 0: people are always like oh, you know I'm just like a year ago.

266
00:16:08,546 --> 00:16:09,892
Speaker 0: You were like, you know some months ago.

267
00:16:09,912 --> 00:16:10,173
Speaker 0: You're like.

268
00:16:10,233 --> 00:16:10,957
Speaker 0: watch Boca Rana.

269
00:16:10,977 --> 00:16:11,640
Speaker 0: watch Boca Rana.

270
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,555
Speaker 1: See the thing is I'm watching by having your cue.

271
00:16:13,595 --> 00:16:16,908
Speaker 1: the way you are You're basically in that XKCD situation.

272
00:16:16,948 --> 00:16:18,914
Speaker 1: We're a year or two after it's done.

273
00:16:19,255 --> 00:16:21,899
Speaker 1: You'll be that guy going like hey, man The cake is a lie.

274
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:24,599
Speaker 0: No, I'm not cuz I don't do stupid shit like that.

275
00:16:24,881 --> 00:16:27,099
Speaker 1: Well, though that's conceptually Scott not literally.

276
00:16:27,139 --> 00:16:27,581
Speaker 1: good God.

277
00:16:27,662 --> 00:16:33,244
Speaker 1: as in you're the one who reads the prince of nothing the fourth book like two years after everyone else already read it talked About it is done with it.

278
00:16:33,505 --> 00:16:34,711
Speaker 0: So what's the difference?

279
00:16:34,852 --> 00:16:36,440
Speaker 1: So then you don't get to talk to anyone about it.

280
00:16:36,721 --> 00:16:37,907
Speaker 0: What do I need to talk to him?

281
00:16:37,967 --> 00:16:39,254
Speaker 0: I enjoy just the same.

282
00:16:39,274 --> 00:16:39,937
Speaker 0: What's the?

283
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:40,460
Speaker 0: what's the problem?

284
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:47,459
Speaker 1: I'd say a good half the enjoyment I get from media is Discussing the media with other people who have also experienced it.

285
00:16:48,323 --> 00:16:57,720
Speaker 0: If I wanted to discuss the media and that was where the enjoyment came from that I probably would just read CliffsNotes and shit, you know, the enjoyment of media is the media in and of itself.

286
00:16:58,348 --> 00:16:59,119
Speaker 1: Well, that's part of it.

287
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:05,939
Speaker 1: But I get very I get equal enjoyment from discussing and you know Seeing other people experience and that sort of thing that I do from actually watching the media.

288
00:17:06,882 --> 00:17:12,720
Speaker 0: My enjoyment is from the the art itself and all right, I really have this need to discuss it with people.

289
00:17:13,001 --> 00:17:19,248
Speaker 0: I mean plus if I see it a year later and Someone might still want to discuss it.

290
00:17:19,309 --> 00:17:20,575
Speaker 0: If not, if not, whatever.

291
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:21,480
Speaker 0: It's not a big deal.

292
00:17:21,969 --> 00:17:31,816
Speaker 0: but anyway I'm gonna watch the Bocorano soon and I does anyone out there know if The Bocorano manga is scans lated or is gonna be published or something?

293
00:17:31,856 --> 00:17:37,500
Speaker 0: because you know I heard long ago that you know, the the TV show was toned down from the manga.

294
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:53,122
Speaker 0: I don't know how true that is But I think we didn't news about it once and I really really want to read the original Bocorano manga to compare and contrast with the TV show which is only 24 episodes which now feels measly compared to the Galaxy Express 3913.

295
00:17:53,122 --> 00:17:56,620
Speaker 0: I think that I think was actually sort of good for me to watch the Galaxy Express.

296
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:01,018
Speaker 0: It's sort of like when a baseball player gets on deck and he swings the bat with a big heavy weight on it.

297
00:18:01,179 --> 00:18:02,184
Speaker 1: Scott Did you look at all?

298
00:18:02,364 --> 00:18:03,409
Speaker 1: all the scans are online?

299
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:04,273
Speaker 0: Are they really?

300
00:18:04,313 --> 00:18:05,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, it took two seconds on Google.

301
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:06,182
Speaker 1: here They are.

302
00:18:06,443 --> 00:18:08,050
Speaker 0: I don't know how to find scans.

303
00:18:08,111 --> 00:18:08,412
Speaker 0: Really.

304
00:18:08,432 --> 00:18:10,000
Speaker 0: I'm not googled for it.

305
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,865
Speaker 0: I'm not a big scans person.

306
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:16,799
Speaker 0: So I don't really and I haven't read scans since Death Note and I own all that.

307
00:18:16,939 --> 00:18:18,643
Speaker 0: so So, okay.

308
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:20,834
Speaker 0: Yeah, send me that link and I will I'll check it out.

309
00:18:21,175 --> 00:18:21,376
Speaker 1: man.

310
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:22,180
Speaker 1: They're watching Bocorano.

311
00:18:22,261 --> 00:18:23,750
Speaker 1: No, that was Scott Johnson of all.

312
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,159
Speaker 1: people finally watch Boca.

313
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,485
Speaker 0: That's his kind of show.

314
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:30,400
Speaker 1: if a show has ever been up his alley more so than now and then here and there it is Bocorano.

315
00:18:30,661 --> 00:18:32,310
Speaker 0: It's definitely a Scott Johnson show.

316
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:34,140
Speaker 1: He just likes tragedy in space.

317
00:18:35,042 --> 00:18:37,939
Speaker 0: Well, this is tragedy on earth and a robot which is close to space.

318
00:18:38,883 --> 00:18:42,297
Speaker 1: Well, wait Bocorano is a show that pulls a switch up a little bit.

319
00:18:42,337 --> 00:18:42,980
Speaker 0: It goes to space.

320
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:47,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't want to say what it's really about but it's a show in space.

321
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:47,601
Speaker 1: It's.

322
00:18:47,882 --> 00:18:51,913
Speaker 1: it's a show that has a lot of change ups and it addresses.

323
00:18:52,174 --> 00:18:54,600
Speaker 1: it addresses issues in a manner that usually shows.

324
00:18:54,641 --> 00:18:57,200
Speaker 0: You know I did watch a handful of episodes of it.

325
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,887
Speaker 0: I watched like four or five if I remember.

326
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:04,990
Speaker 1: it's a show that gets a lot of points for the fact that and all all the Characters react in believable and intelligent manners.

327
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:06,254
Speaker 1: There's a space robot.

328
00:19:06,355 --> 00:19:07,820
Speaker 1: I go straight to the military.

329
00:19:08,001 --> 00:19:11,882
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the show did progress really quickly from the few episodes I watched.

330
00:19:12,203 --> 00:19:15,817
Speaker 0: so it would have to pull some change-ups in order to have somewhere to go for 24 episodes.

331
00:19:18,402 --> 00:19:20,059
Speaker 0: They'd run out of ground real quick.

332
00:19:20,823 --> 00:19:30,360
Speaker 1: They couldn't really run out of ground because all they have to do is kill one child per episode and then when they're out of Thing is is 24 episodes, but there aren't 24 children so it has to be at a slower rate than that.

333
00:19:30,641 --> 00:19:31,885
Speaker 1: Well, maybe they get some more children.

334
00:19:32,126 --> 00:19:33,872
Speaker 0: Maybe that's possible.

335
00:19:33,912 --> 00:19:34,494
Speaker 0: I don't know.

336
00:19:34,534 --> 00:19:36,039
Speaker 1: the room of golf is empty.

337
00:19:36,401 --> 00:19:37,444
Speaker 0: No, no room.

338
00:19:37,464 --> 00:19:39,611
Speaker 0: go know whoever you get that joke.

339
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:42,380
Speaker 0: You're a hundred million times awesome and you win a prize.

340
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:44,732
Speaker 0: The prize is this golf clap.

341
00:19:46,039 --> 00:19:47,045
Speaker 0: I Don't know if you heard that or not.

342
00:19:47,246 --> 00:19:49,700
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure the noise suppression will get rid of that.

343
00:19:50,042 --> 00:19:52,155
Speaker 0: Okay, but you you there was a golf clap there.

344
00:19:52,175 --> 00:19:52,779
Speaker 0: whether you heard or not.

345
00:19:53,805 --> 00:19:56,840
Speaker 0: All right, so well you've been watching a bunch of animes.

346
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:57,787
Speaker 0: I watched oh my god.

347
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:04,977
Speaker 1: So I recently I think I mentioned this before finally watched giant robo and that show is like.

348
00:20:05,057 --> 00:20:05,819
Speaker 0: that was a while ago.

349
00:20:06,161 --> 00:20:07,006
Speaker 1: It wasn't that long ago.

350
00:20:07,066 --> 00:20:09,240
Speaker 1: That show is like so great.

351
00:20:09,522 --> 00:20:16,740
Speaker 1: I cannot express to you how great giant robo is But you really can't enjoy it unless you're an anime fan who has seen a lot of anime.

352
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:21,478
Speaker 1: It is it's like the I think I said the uncanny valley of highbrow.

353
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:32,817
Speaker 1: lowbrow Where it seems lowbrow Unless you've gotten past this point and once you get past that point you realize that it's actually highbrow secret highbrow But it's almost faux highbrow.

354
00:20:32,837 --> 00:20:35,224
Speaker 1: Oh That's what I would say.

355
00:20:35,245 --> 00:20:37,493
Speaker 1: faux highbrow is what I would call giant robo.

356
00:20:37,514 --> 00:20:42,491
Speaker 0: guys like lifting up one eyebrow But then you get to get a closer look and it was a false brow.

357
00:20:42,511 --> 00:20:43,515
Speaker 1: It's just there's so much.

358
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:44,899
Speaker 1: oh my it's got.

359
00:20:45,604 --> 00:20:56,528
Speaker 1: It's got homage to all these like great And other anime and all that but it's got this kind of symphonic classy character That it very much reeks of.

360
00:20:56,588 --> 00:21:05,186
Speaker 1: read or die of you take as absurd concepts But you animate it really well with good music and good characters and you make it take itself 100% dead serious.

361
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:11,060
Speaker 1: There is never a moment where the show doubts itself in any way.

362
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:12,684
Speaker 0: I think that is.

363
00:21:12,824 --> 00:21:15,092
Speaker 0: that is something that a lot of animes have in common.

364
00:21:15,132 --> 00:21:21,632
Speaker 0: when like this is like visual like Lunacy going on right, but it's taken completely seriously.

365
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:27,260
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, that's really, you know, if you look at something like, you know Gundam it's like the almost the same exact thing, right?

366
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,153
Speaker 0: They have these like ludicrous robots that they just.

367
00:21:30,193 --> 00:21:36,175
Speaker 0: they really are completely nuts But everyone just takes them at face value and and thus they are at face value.

368
00:21:36,236 --> 00:21:45,900
Speaker 0: and it's all about you know the attitude of The believable human characters in a show towards the nutty unrealistic things that happen in the show.

369
00:21:46,816 --> 00:21:48,527
Speaker 0: You know Like this, you know Galaxy Express in 113 episodes.

370
00:21:51,681 --> 00:21:58,625
Speaker 0: Some episodes are better than others and the ones that are better are usually not necessarily the ones where you know There aren't crazy things.

371
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:01,779
Speaker 0: cuz I mean there are crazy episodes with like freaking dinosaurs and shit, right?

372
00:22:02,360 --> 00:22:07,000
Speaker 0: But it's the episodes where they don't treat the crazy things as being crazy.

373
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:14,820
Speaker 0: Like there's an episode with like weird aliens, but the weird aliens that were totally goofy were you know treated as totally normal aliens.

374
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:22,788
Speaker 0: You know, there's an episode of like the butterfly people but they treated the butterfly people as people so it worked out Well, but then there were some other episodes.

375
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:27,428
Speaker 0: were just normal people not nothing even crazy But they treated it as wacky.

376
00:22:27,488 --> 00:22:30,640
Speaker 0: so it came off all and it wasn't, you know, the greatest episode ever.

377
00:22:30,901 --> 00:22:37,122
Speaker 1: They just it all harkens back to read or die when they make that giant paper airplane and ride it off of the skyscraper Into a dogfight.

378
00:22:37,563 --> 00:22:43,736
Speaker 0: Mmm, man, if you're on a go, but you know, but when you were watching giant Robo, I was watching like Goon saga, I never finished that.

379
00:22:43,896 --> 00:22:45,381
Speaker 0: maybe after I finished bokurato.

380
00:22:45,402 --> 00:22:47,750
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go back and try to finish the goon side.

381
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:49,479
Speaker 1: I definitely want to watch some goon sighs.

382
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:51,510
Speaker 1: I saw the first I think three episodes.

383
00:22:51,590 --> 00:22:55,308
Speaker 0: I was like, nah, I really dug it maybe four or five.

384
00:22:55,328 --> 00:22:55,810
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

385
00:22:56,031 --> 00:22:59,550
Speaker 1: You know how I want a ghost in the shell standalone complex to happen again.

386
00:23:00,172 --> 00:23:05,770
Speaker 1: I want a serious fantasy anime to happen again when goon saga is a serious fan exactly so I gotta watch it.

387
00:23:05,991 --> 00:23:12,209
Speaker 0: There was also watching the shin messenger which is directed by the giant robo guy.

388
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:13,597
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you know what they're.

389
00:23:13,718 --> 00:23:19,873
Speaker 1: they having seen the first episode of that They're very very similar in the way They treat themselves.

390
00:23:19,893 --> 00:23:19,973
Speaker 0: well.

391
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:28,119
Speaker 0: after that if you watch the second at the first episode is like, uh, and the second episode is like, ah the third episodes like oh Okay.

392
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,464
Speaker 0: Okay.

393
00:23:28,484 --> 00:23:38,065
Speaker 1: It's like they did something that whole concept of you know start with something crazy and then Eventually get to the point of so how did it all come to this?

394
00:23:38,085 --> 00:23:39,070
Speaker 1: I love that.

395
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:39,947
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty good.

396
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:46,690
Speaker 1: That's sort of like in media res but not really because there's no way you could have possibly known what was going on.

397
00:23:47,413 --> 00:23:48,639
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right.

398
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,670
Speaker 0: So let me talk about some comics here.

399
00:23:50,851 --> 00:24:02,470
Speaker 0: So I read I got the first trade paperback of all star Batman and Robin and the reason it's called all star Batman and Robin is because the creators are all stars.

400
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:06,770
Speaker 0: It's written by a Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee's the all-star Batman and Robin, right?

401
00:24:07,252 --> 00:24:11,496
Speaker 0: And it doesn't really have much to do with any other Batman or Robin.

402
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:15,310
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, it's the it's you know, same story of you know, the origin of Robin, right?

403
00:24:15,411 --> 00:24:16,681
Speaker 0: But it's you know, it's.

404
00:24:16,782 --> 00:24:19,096
Speaker 0: it's not like, you know It has anything to do with like.

405
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:19,578
Speaker 0: it's not like.

406
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:22,310
Speaker 0: it's a read the actual Batman comic to know what's going on.

407
00:24:22,370 --> 00:24:23,935
Speaker 0: It's not tied in with anything else.

408
00:24:24,417 --> 00:24:28,230
Speaker 0: In fact, you know someone suggested that this is in like the Dark Knight universe.

409
00:24:28,351 --> 00:24:31,469
Speaker 0: But so it's like the pre prequel, you know, like way back.

410
00:24:32,652 --> 00:24:35,507
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm not worrying about DC continuity, right?

411
00:24:35,568 --> 00:24:38,199
Speaker 0: Exactly You know, this is the sort of the it's.

412
00:24:38,319 --> 00:24:40,310
Speaker 0: it's sort of infamous on the Internet's, you know.

413
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:46,164
Speaker 0: You've probably seen like pictures of Batman Painting the whole like apartment yellow for when the Green Lantern shows up.

414
00:24:46,465 --> 00:24:47,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's this comic, right?

415
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:53,333
Speaker 0: Also, the thing is that the thing that this comic is most infamous for that You might not realize.

416
00:24:53,353 --> 00:24:57,585
Speaker 0: is you've heard people talk about the goddamn Batman, right?

417
00:24:57,765 --> 00:24:59,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's where this comes from.

418
00:24:59,812 --> 00:25:03,230
Speaker 0: They basically say goddamn Batman like a thousand times.

419
00:25:03,491 --> 00:25:09,581
Speaker 0: There's even one panel where he's like, you know What this girl's insulting him for calling it the Batmobile like.

420
00:25:09,762 --> 00:25:12,170
Speaker 0: that's one of the jokes is like the Batmobile is a stupid name.

421
00:25:12,632 --> 00:25:13,033
Speaker 0: He's like.

422
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:14,760
Speaker 0: I'm the goddamn Batman.

423
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:15,985
Speaker 0: I'll call my goddamn car.

424
00:25:16,005 --> 00:25:20,140
Speaker 0: Whatever I goddamn feel like You know, it's like that.

425
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,345
Speaker 1: that is very juggernaut.

426
00:25:21,866 --> 00:25:22,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly, right?

427
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,316
Speaker 0: But yeah, it's.

428
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:27,190
Speaker 0: you know, it's not the best Batman comic in the universe.

429
00:25:27,270 --> 00:25:27,872
Speaker 0: But you know what?

430
00:25:28,695 --> 00:25:35,500
Speaker 0: if you want a Batman comic to read and you already read Dark Knight Returns Why the hell not right?

431
00:25:35,521 --> 00:25:36,590
Speaker 0: I mean, it's Batman.

432
00:25:36,791 --> 00:25:41,330
Speaker 0: But give me that same feeling of when I read Dark Knight Returns the right, you know, I don't read Dark Knight Returns.

433
00:25:41,531 --> 00:25:43,458
Speaker 0: I feel like I'm watching a Batman movie, right?

434
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,711
Speaker 0: This feels more like I Don't know.

435
00:25:46,952 --> 00:25:47,393
Speaker 1: Well Scott.

436
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:51,750
Speaker 1: We're in the minority where we like the Michael Keaton Batman above all other Batman movies, correct?

437
00:25:51,970 --> 00:25:54,922
Speaker 1: I mean, I'll admit I thought Batman begins with shit.

438
00:25:55,042 --> 00:25:57,010
Speaker 0: I also thought Batman begins with shit.

439
00:25:57,070 --> 00:25:58,690
Speaker 1: It was just too unrelated movie.

440
00:25:58,710 --> 00:26:14,169
Speaker 0: It was like a kung-fu movie coupled with a cheesy Batman movie with no real I didn't see the newest one that everyone likes so much but is Directed by the same guy who like who made the Batman, you know begins or whatever, which I thought was poop.

441
00:26:14,189 --> 00:26:20,050
Speaker 0: and You know everyone who liked the one that I thought was poop also like the new one the Dark Knight.

442
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,429
Speaker 1: So what the new one had goods?

443
00:26:21,770 --> 00:26:27,873
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna prejudge was the Joker but I watched on YouTube every scene that the Joker's in Uh-huh.

444
00:26:27,973 --> 00:26:29,378
Speaker 1: I feel like that's all I needed to do.

445
00:26:29,579 --> 00:26:32,409
Speaker 0: Yeah, see I can't pass a judgment because I haven't seen it.

446
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:34,909
Speaker 1: Wait, so then to this day, you don't know what the pencil trick is.

447
00:26:35,433 --> 00:26:36,056
Speaker 0: I don't really care.

448
00:26:36,076 --> 00:26:38,350
Speaker 1: Joker does a really good magic trick with a pencil.

449
00:26:38,531 --> 00:26:44,435
Speaker 0: I know that everyone makes a joke about a pencil trick and I really just don't give a shit what it is It's really man.

450
00:26:44,455 --> 00:26:45,539
Speaker 1: You're all like soon.

451
00:26:45,559 --> 00:26:47,747
Speaker 0: today today, whatever movie new cares.

452
00:26:47,767 --> 00:26:51,617
Speaker 0: It's like Joke about the pencil trick whatever.

453
00:26:51,898 --> 00:26:53,744
Speaker 1: I don't care about the anime industry.

454
00:26:53,804 --> 00:26:55,730
Speaker 1: I don't watch anime and I don't care about anything.

455
00:26:55,790 --> 00:26:57,957
Speaker 0: Anyone else cares about this crap.

456
00:26:58,438 --> 00:26:59,802
Speaker 1: So you ever get excited about anything?

457
00:26:59,982 --> 00:27:00,604
Speaker 0: I'm good.

458
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:03,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm getting excited about all these other things I'm talking about.

459
00:27:03,277 --> 00:27:04,670
Speaker 0: All right, you're being all you're not?

460
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:08,582
Speaker 0: I watch 113 episodes of Galaxy Express.

461
00:27:08,603 --> 00:27:08,683
Speaker 1: Yes.

462
00:27:08,703 --> 00:27:10,632
Speaker 1: It's one of the greatest anime ever I'd like.

463
00:27:11,114 --> 00:27:16,715
Speaker 1: I'm so pumped about watching the end because I haven't seen the movie in like Almost 10 years.

464
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:21,959
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw the movie maybe a year or so ago when I downloaded it But that was only the second time I watched it.

465
00:27:21,979 --> 00:27:23,830
Speaker 0: No only the first time I watched it unedited.

466
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:26,380
Speaker 1: I'm real excited because Emily has like she's.

467
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:28,910
Speaker 1: she has not seen the movie and she has not seen the anime.

468
00:27:29,071 --> 00:27:34,150
Speaker 1: So well, she saw random episodes of the anime, but she does not know like what it really is.

469
00:27:34,351 --> 00:27:38,145
Speaker 0: I remember sitting there once and she's like, so what's may tells deal and I'm like, you don't know.

470
00:27:38,165 --> 00:27:43,330
Speaker 1: Holy shit Really, but imagine being a kid in the 70s in Japan where you didn't know.

471
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:46,430
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is you were spoiled as soon as you saw the movie if you saw the movie.

472
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,903
Speaker 0: So anyway, yeah, there's that Batman book is out there.

473
00:27:50,923 --> 00:27:51,926
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's.

474
00:27:52,007 --> 00:27:52,889
Speaker 0: you can get it in a trade.

475
00:27:52,950 --> 00:27:54,319
Speaker 0: now The trade isn't all of it though.

476
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:59,129
Speaker 0: There's like another trade coming But apparently it just takes them so long to come out with issues of this.

477
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:01,828
Speaker 0: So who knows when that second trade is coming probably years from now?

478
00:28:02,930 --> 00:28:12,810
Speaker 1: actually what I'm watching right now that I'm really excited about is I Finally own irresponsible captain Tyler, which is weird because you know, whenever we do that anime you should see panel.

479
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,769
Speaker 1: I talk about anime.

480
00:28:14,492 --> 00:28:20,049
Speaker 1: I always talk about how like utenna is my favorite anime and cowboy bebop is the best anime and I have all these things.

481
00:28:20,109 --> 00:28:26,870
Speaker 1: but Really Irresponsible captain Tyler is in many ways my personal favorite anime.

482
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,270
Speaker 1: The show was just is one of the first anime that I really watched and really got into.

483
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,923
Speaker 1: I mean I bought VHS tapes of this thing back in the day.

484
00:28:35,164 --> 00:28:38,035
Speaker 0: It's a real crowd-pleaser That's for sure.

485
00:28:38,296 --> 00:28:41,450
Speaker 1: One thing I can say though is I watched it like I didn't even see all of it.

486
00:28:41,470 --> 00:28:42,437
Speaker 1: You know, I never had money.

487
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:44,430
Speaker 1: I got like the first couple of VHS tapes.

488
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:49,550
Speaker 0: So I saw like the first maybe nine episodes, but I only really paid attention to the first two or three.

489
00:28:49,992 --> 00:28:53,307
Speaker 1: I saw the first I don't know seven episodes back in the day.

490
00:28:53,368 --> 00:29:06,129
Speaker 1: legitimately I saw like eight more episodes in shit like terrible fan subs and then I saw the last three episodes and then this like 100 by 100 pixel RM file of the movie.

491
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:11,492
Speaker 0: Yeah, I saw that hundred by hundred RM file the movie, but I don't remember anything I will.

492
00:29:11,713 --> 00:29:13,922
Speaker 1: basically it's just Roman holiday.

493
00:29:14,645 --> 00:29:15,770
Speaker 0: Oh, I like Roman holiday.

494
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:18,550
Speaker 1: Yeah, well then you would really like the responsible captain Tyler movie.

495
00:29:18,832 --> 00:29:20,121
Speaker 0: I can go back and watch that wreck show.

496
00:29:20,161 --> 00:29:20,765
Speaker 0: That wasn't too many.

497
00:29:20,866 --> 00:29:22,354
Speaker 1: Oh my god That show was great.

498
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:23,700
Speaker 1: At least the one episode ever.

499
00:29:23,741 --> 00:29:25,790
Speaker 1: We watched was good Roman holiday episode.

500
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, but every episode of that was like an Audrey Hepburn movie.

501
00:29:30,488 --> 00:29:33,542
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm All right, I'll take a little break in the middle of the episode here.

502
00:29:33,723 --> 00:29:34,084
Speaker 0: break.

503
00:29:34,185 --> 00:29:35,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta talk about something.

504
00:29:35,391 --> 00:29:37,220
Speaker 1: I was in the middle of talking about something.

505
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:39,130
Speaker 1: Come on irresponsible captain Tyler.

506
00:29:40,411 --> 00:29:43,525
Speaker 1: The thing is it's like it's my favorite show, but I really like.

507
00:29:43,585 --> 00:29:50,796
Speaker 1: I watched it Mostly once a long time ago and it says a lot that it influenced me so much to where I hold it in such high esteem.

508
00:29:51,628 --> 00:30:00,009
Speaker 1: and Like when Scott watch Ava again or when I watch eska flown a again or a lot of these older anime that you know I always thought it was like the greatest things ever.

509
00:30:00,732 --> 00:30:07,594
Speaker 1: I finally bought the box set because it was republished in a thin pack and it wasn't like $100 and I started watching it again I'm about halfway through.

510
00:30:07,634 --> 00:30:17,209
Speaker 1: I've seen the first like 14 episodes now on a DVD for reals and Any time I worry that some show that I thought was great a long time ago is gonna he-man me.

511
00:30:18,191 --> 00:30:19,498
Speaker 1: Anime always proves me wrong.

512
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:23,774
Speaker 1: This show is just so fantastic I know right?

513
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:39,185
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, I saw he-man when I was a kid and I thought it was great And I watch it now not so great But like Ava, you know you just said it's like I watched Ava right like a couple times back in the day and I didn't watch it for a long Time and all I you know, just people kept talking about it.

514
00:30:39,245 --> 00:30:40,290
Speaker 0: All the show fucks with your head.

515
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:41,415
Speaker 0: Oh, it's got a crazy ending.

516
00:30:41,495 --> 00:30:44,790
Speaker 0: Oh, it sucks and I sorta, you know forgot that it was great.

517
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,826
Speaker 0: And then I watched it again and it was better than it had ever been.

518
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:53,770
Speaker 0: and I'm like, wow All these years these people have been saying it's you know hard this and that and like they were all completely wrong.

519
00:30:53,911 --> 00:30:56,763
Speaker 0: And I think captain Tyler is you know the same way.

520
00:30:56,804 --> 00:30:58,190
Speaker 0: It's like I haven't seen it in forever.

521
00:30:58,632 --> 00:31:01,543
Speaker 0: I remember it was kind of silly, you know above average.

522
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:04,924
Speaker 0: I have a feeling when I watch it again It's gonna be like oh shit.

523
00:31:05,066 --> 00:31:10,110
Speaker 1: one thing I I hadn't seen a lot of anime when I saw irresponsible captain Tyler the first time.

524
00:31:10,130 --> 00:31:13,001
Speaker 1: But now and I'm noticed that's the same thing with giant robo.

525
00:31:13,382 --> 00:31:15,370
Speaker 1: I've seen a lot of anime now.

526
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:18,229
Speaker 1: I remember that list of you know, like the hundred must see anime and I'll.

527
00:31:19,031 --> 00:31:20,683
Speaker 1: Basically, we've seen like 98 of them.

528
00:31:22,012 --> 00:31:27,170
Speaker 0: Most of them or we at least know of or you know are very familiar with them if we haven't actually seen them.

529
00:31:27,633 --> 00:31:33,198
Speaker 1: so watching it now and Having all this context the show is even better.

530
00:31:33,279 --> 00:31:38,917
Speaker 1: like just there's so many legend of the galactic heroes jokes Because it's kind of.

531
00:31:39,018 --> 00:31:45,169
Speaker 1: you know young wendy like it's kind of based on that in a way and that it's almost a parody of it, but not really it.

532
00:31:46,373 --> 00:31:49,394
Speaker 1: Plus the animation is Surprisingly good.

533
00:31:49,514 --> 00:32:01,619
Speaker 1: I mean the show feels almost if you start to watch it again at first like one of those kind of low-budget anime, but you look at it and the cell animation is just Surprisingly beautiful and well done.

534
00:32:02,321 --> 00:32:06,676
Speaker 1: It just really stands out and there's such attention to detail and I think a Lot of people.

535
00:32:06,736 --> 00:32:19,950
Speaker 1: this has made me realize, you know, Dave and Joel when they talk about Akira they talked a lot about cell animation and how everything after cell animation wasn't as good and how great that is and I Realized exactly what the issue is with cell animation.

536
00:32:21,012 --> 00:32:26,236
Speaker 1: There was a lot of crap but for people who were dedicated to the shows They were making they put in like.

537
00:32:26,276 --> 00:32:41,409
Speaker 1: there was this attention to detail that was unsurpassed and there are so many Tiny little throwaway jokes that are animated in the background of this show Like the guy with the chainsaw doing something silly or a guy just making dumb faces at someone when he turns his back.

538
00:32:42,972 --> 00:32:45,570
Speaker 0: It's not just the cell versus digital that causes stuff like that.

539
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:48,662
Speaker 0: It's the fact that all of the the grunt work is outsourced.

540
00:32:48,722 --> 00:32:51,590
Speaker 0: now that is a major contributor to the lot You didn't let me finish.

541
00:32:51,650 --> 00:33:00,690
Speaker 1: What I was saying is that in a lot of newer anime at least a lot of the bad worst anime because you know You can do all this stuff with digital animation the same way you can do with cells.

542
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:10,530
Speaker 1: But a lot of anime kind of cop out and they just they do the scene to make it work Rather than putting that extra little bit to do something funny in the background that most people won't even notice.

543
00:33:11,232 --> 00:33:17,333
Speaker 1: And I think it's really just a matter of the culture of making the shows and the money in the industry and everything because it's the Same as CDs.

544
00:33:17,835 --> 00:33:27,229
Speaker 1: people are nostalgic for records because a lot of records had much greater dynamic contrast and that sort of thing and they felt like there was more attention put into the mastering.

545
00:33:27,249 --> 00:33:37,890
Speaker 1: and While it's true that there probably was more attention put into the mastering a CD has so much more potential to be good than a record and so much more room to make an awesome work.

546
00:33:38,612 --> 00:33:45,729
Speaker 1: But most people who put stuff on CDs nowadays are lazy and just normalize the hell out of their music and clip it and just Get it on there as loud as possible.

547
00:33:46,373 --> 00:33:50,089
Speaker 1: They could make music that was just as dynamically awesome as a record on a CD.

548
00:33:50,872 --> 00:33:51,614
Speaker 1: They just don't.

549
00:33:51,675 --> 00:33:57,277
Speaker 1: so as a result, there's this conflation between kind of good stuff and vinyl Mmm-hmm.

550
00:33:57,418 --> 00:33:58,930
Speaker 1: I think it's the same thing with sound animation.

551
00:33:59,233 --> 00:34:00,847
Speaker 0: Well, I think what it is is it's not.

552
00:34:00,888 --> 00:34:02,335
Speaker 0: you know The it's not just.

553
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:02,937
Speaker 0: we're.

554
00:34:02,977 --> 00:34:06,050
Speaker 0: look we see from our end being consumers of the entertainment, right?

555
00:34:06,390 --> 00:34:10,764
Speaker 0: We're looking at the change in the you know, the the delivery medium.

556
00:34:10,824 --> 00:34:12,550
Speaker 0: right you're talking about CDs and records, right?

557
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:16,710
Speaker 0: But really what it is is a change in the tools of production, right?

558
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:22,770
Speaker 0: I mean someone's sitting there drawing things by hand, you know to doodle in a little funny thing in the back.

559
00:34:22,891 --> 00:34:23,784
Speaker 0: You know you think about.

560
00:34:23,826 --> 00:34:38,989
Speaker 0: you know Physicality of that, you know doodling something in the corner right now think about someone sitting at a computer Even if they've got like a Wacom or something, you know It's like to doodle something in the in the background of like a scene is a completely different thing when you're doing it digitally.

561
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:47,070
Speaker 1: You know and it's not well, it's got doodling something in the background of a scene with cells forever You've got to put it in the keyframes then you got to get it to the in-betweens and that sort of thing.

562
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,913
Speaker 1: It's not quite so simple I don't know.

563
00:34:48,954 --> 00:34:50,550
Speaker 0: I didn't say I didn't say it's simple.

564
00:34:50,650 --> 00:34:55,909
Speaker 0: But you think about the physicality of doodling in the corner versus the physicality.

565
00:34:56,272 --> 00:34:57,950
Speaker 0: You know doing it on the computer, right?

566
00:34:58,130 --> 00:35:01,430
Speaker 0: And that's that's the reason that something like that would happen, you know with one.

567
00:35:02,334 --> 00:35:02,474
Speaker 0: That

568
00:35:02,535 --> 00:35:16,825
Speaker 1: stuff does happen with great anime that's made now with the modern tools and I think what it really comes down to is the filter of quality and Shows like Tyler are just so high quality you know, I get a lot of flack for people saying that I only like the old anime and that's not true.

569
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:22,289

574
00:35:36,414 --> 00:35:44,669
Speaker 1: I don't know transcendent of all the other stuff that was coming out even at the time That they hold up today more so than a lot of stuff coming out now.

575
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:51,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean this, you know, even stuff that comes out now that I watch, you know What is still gonna hold up, you know?

00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:58,025
Speaker 0: What show from now is still gonna be good in 30 years?

578
00:35:58,065 --> 00:35:59,310
Speaker 1: I think Baccano will hold up.

579
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:00,914
Speaker 0: Hey, I don't know.

580
00:36:01,215 --> 00:36:04,266
Speaker 1: Baccano has such just a fun style to it and it's different.

581
00:36:04,286 --> 00:36:05,531
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, I like it You know what?

582
00:36:05,551 --> 00:36:12,819
Speaker 0: I've watched maybe five or six episodes and I'll finish it, you know in some time five years from now We'll be doing the show and it's gotta be like man.

583
00:36:13,061 --> 00:36:14,206
Speaker 1: So I just watched Baccano.

584
00:36:14,226 --> 00:36:16,110
Speaker 0: That show was awesome Yeah, but I don't know.

585
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:19,405
Speaker 0: I don't feel like Baccano will hold up over a long period of time.

586
00:36:19,425 --> 00:36:23,828
Speaker 0: I Can't see myself like, you know watching it again after I finish it.

587
00:36:23,948 --> 00:36:24,210
Speaker 0: Why not?

588
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:30,510
Speaker 1: Are you kidding that that is definitely a rewashable show just for it's got a lot of those kind of just epic scenes?

589
00:36:31,491 --> 00:36:33,857
Speaker 1: Yeah Anyway, you're about everything.

590
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:36,310
Speaker 1: No except a couple of comics, I guess.

591
00:36:36,470 --> 00:36:47,074
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I've got to make this thing that I forgot to say at the beginning of the show We've I'm redoing the website, but I'm not redoing it in any way that you're gonna notice Most likely right?

592
00:36:47,435 --> 00:36:50,767
Speaker 0: Um, basically it's gonna be 2.0 of the site that's already there.

593
00:36:50,807 --> 00:36:53,494
Speaker 0: So it's gonna look 99% the same right?

594
00:36:53,554 --> 00:36:59,070
Speaker 0: I'm just basically, you know polishing it and doing all kinds of stuff and I've already made a humongous progress in.

595
00:37:00,052 --> 00:37:01,620
Speaker 0: But it's not, you know, it's not live yet.

596
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:07,200
Speaker 0: It's on my laptop, you know, and once it's all ready I'm gonna put it out there and we're gonna add a bunch of nice features for you.

597
00:37:07,220 --> 00:37:21,150
Speaker 0: Like automatically, you know posting episodes to Twitter and Automatically, you know linking the forum and the website, you know an interesting way And you know when Google Wave is out, we're gonna integrate Google Wave in some nice ways, whatever.

598
00:37:22,711 --> 00:37:26,906
Speaker 0: But one thing that I decided to do is we have these ads in the forum.

599
00:37:26,926 --> 00:37:28,070
Speaker 0: You may have noticed them, right?

600
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:30,121
Speaker 0: We don't really make money off them.

601
00:37:30,141 --> 00:37:31,589
Speaker 1: You couldn't wait till the end of the show for this.

602
00:37:31,972 --> 00:37:39,193
Speaker 0: Well, no, because I wanted to you know, I figure people would start, you know The I forgot to do at the beginning of the show and I figured doing it in the middle of the show Right.

603
00:37:39,516 --> 00:37:47,310
Speaker 0: people would be like, ah and you know They wouldn't like turn off the the episode when I started talking about it because we're still gonna talk about more awesome stuff after this.

604
00:37:47,370 --> 00:37:48,375
Speaker 1: Actually, we're going on pretty long.

605
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:49,019
Speaker 1: I don't think we will.

606
00:37:49,341 --> 00:37:50,466
Speaker 0: No, you don't think we will.

607
00:37:50,547 --> 00:37:52,125
Speaker 0: now Bob I got stuff to talk about.

608
00:37:52,712 --> 00:37:53,758
Speaker 1: Anyway, cuz I want to go to.

609
00:37:53,859 --> 00:37:54,885
Speaker 1: I got to go to work soon.

610
00:37:55,207 --> 00:37:59,149
Speaker 0: Oh shits All right, well actually leaves us with more materials for the future, which is good.

611
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:09,267
Speaker 0: But anyway, the long and short of it is that we haven't made that much money off ads and that's fine Cuz we didn't really expect you anyway, but where you can use that money instead to buy ads.

612
00:38:12,893 --> 00:38:16,027
Speaker 0: You know, we said we would never have advertising in geek nights the show.

613
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:17,373
Speaker 0: that is true That's true.

614
00:38:17,473 --> 00:38:18,256
Speaker 0: That'll never happen.

615
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:21,289
Speaker 0: nor will there be advertising on for a crew.

616
00:38:21,329 --> 00:38:31,989
Speaker 0: calm But there may be advertising in other things that we may make, you know, but anyway You know, we never said he wouldn't buy ads that say hey listen to geek nights, right and I want it.

617
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,917
Speaker 0: You know mostly I'm not really.

618
00:38:34,138 --> 00:38:37,230
Speaker 0: you know, it would be a nice bonus if they worked and got us a bunch of listeners.

619
00:38:37,553 --> 00:38:38,886
Speaker 0: But mostly I'm just want to see.

620
00:38:38,987 --> 00:38:42,310
Speaker 0: you know I want to experience buying ads something that I have not done.

621
00:38:42,350 --> 00:38:45,450
Speaker 0: I want to see how the whole thing works and you know learn about it and all that stuff.

622
00:38:45,490 --> 00:38:47,681
Speaker 0: So the thing is to buy ads.

623
00:38:48,264 --> 00:38:49,550
Speaker 0: we need ads, right?

624
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:58,903
Speaker 0: We mean I could do a text ad if I wanted to but we know we need images arts to you know That are the correct shape and size to purchase, you know in place on other sites.

625
00:38:59,444 --> 00:39:01,430
Speaker 0: So I made a little contest.

626
00:39:01,551 --> 00:39:02,239
Speaker 0: It's in the forum.

627
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:11,308
Speaker 0: It's also on the website to you know, basically You make ads and we'll pick some out that we think are the winners and then there will be a prize.

628
00:39:11,368 --> 00:39:13,415
Speaker 0: and the thing is I actually have a prize.

629
00:39:13,435 --> 00:39:13,676
Speaker 1: Yes.

630
00:39:13,736 --> 00:39:15,863
Speaker 1: This isn't where you know, the classic rim.

631
00:39:16,324 --> 00:39:18,150
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll give some sort of prize for that.

632
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:18,472
Speaker 1: He's got.

633
00:39:18,492 --> 00:39:20,022
Speaker 1: we have a prize and not really.

634
00:39:20,323 --> 00:39:21,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll think of something.

635
00:39:21,671 --> 00:39:23,017
Speaker 1: We actually there is a prize.

636
00:39:23,057 --> 00:39:23,880
Speaker 0: there is a prize.

637
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:24,764
Speaker 1: What do you see?

638
00:39:24,824 --> 00:39:26,169
Speaker 1: It is there it is a real prize.

639
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,367
Speaker 0: now this is a little story right?

640
00:39:28,569 --> 00:39:28,609
Speaker 0: is?

641
00:39:30,072 --> 00:39:37,610
Speaker 0: The Akira manga right has been out in English for a while now But you know it came out while I was in college and I bought all six volumes in Dark Horse.

642
00:39:37,691 --> 00:39:39,790
Speaker 0: They're very expensive six gigantic volumes.

643
00:39:40,071 --> 00:39:43,861
Speaker 0: they're exactly the same as the Japanese volumes except they're flipped over from.

644
00:39:43,982 --> 00:39:48,522
Speaker 0: you know, so they're you know, English direction left to right and They're translated.

645
00:39:48,624 --> 00:39:55,150
Speaker 0: obviously The thing about these volumes that they've been out of print and not so easy to get and not cheap to get either.

646
00:39:56,112 --> 00:39:57,239
Speaker 0: Now you might be wondering Scott.

647
00:39:57,259 --> 00:39:58,526
Speaker 0: You're gonna give those volumes away.

648
00:39:58,586 --> 00:40:02,646
Speaker 0: Holy shit Akira's like, you know, this is the most amazing manga, you know, one of your favorites.

649
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:03,390
Speaker 0: you gonna give it away?

650
00:40:03,471 --> 00:40:04,503
Speaker 0: Well, not exactly.

651
00:40:04,523 --> 00:40:08,923
Speaker 0: you see Kodansha see Dark Horse lost the license for a cure.

652
00:40:08,963 --> 00:40:10,590
Speaker 0: They also lost the license for Ghost in the Shell.

653
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:13,650
Speaker 0: I guess I don't know why but they're I guess they it expired.

654
00:40:14,232 --> 00:40:20,350
Speaker 0: So Kodansha the actual Japanese publisher of these things is going to directly publish them in the United States.

655
00:40:21,171 --> 00:40:23,826
Speaker 0: so in two months for now or I assume the.

656
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:32,414
Speaker 0: You know cuz I'm ordering it this month the first volume of the Akira manga is coming out in the u.s From Kodansha.

657
00:40:32,434 --> 00:40:37,150
Speaker 0: now, I don't know if it's printed from right to left, but I have to assume it's gonna be the same size.

658
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:37,552
Speaker 0: I mean the.

659
00:40:37,774 --> 00:40:40,289
Speaker 0: the image they showed of it is the same exact cover image.

660
00:40:40,875 --> 00:40:47,110
Speaker 0: So, you know I have to without this information about if it's gonna be flipped or if it has a different translation or whatever.

661
00:40:47,692 --> 00:40:53,450
Speaker 0: I gotta buy it to compare and contrast it with what I got right, you know, I can't just let it go like that.

662
00:40:53,911 --> 00:41:00,128
Speaker 0: so the result is that I'm gonna have two sets of the Akira manga the Kodansha and the Dark Horse.

663
00:41:00,469 --> 00:41:06,045
Speaker 0: and You know, I don't imagine that either one of them will be bad, but I'm going to.

664
00:41:06,106 --> 00:41:08,815
Speaker 0: probably once I have both sets I won't need both of them.

665
00:41:08,935 --> 00:41:12,450
Speaker 0: I'll pick whichever one I like better and the other one will be the prize.

666
00:41:12,891 --> 00:41:26,445
Speaker 0: So you will get the entire set of Akira manga either Dark Horse or Kodansha editions It's up to me, which is you know manufacturers retail price of at least like $180 worth of comics.

667
00:41:26,866 --> 00:41:28,150
Speaker 0: It's six gigantic volumes.

668
00:41:28,711 --> 00:41:39,305
Speaker 0: So if you make us awesome ads that are worthy of us putting them on other websites and paying money for that Then you can win all of Akira the manga, which is totally awesome.

669
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:39,847
Speaker 1: All right.

670
00:41:40,369 --> 00:41:50,967
Speaker 1: Yes So make us ads and post them in the forum or email them to us or I point out that while we won't use them I would very much appreciate ironic entries in addition to real entries.

671
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:54,970
Speaker 0: Yes Humor will be rewarded with golf claps.

672
00:41:55,050 --> 00:42:08,681
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is if someone submits and a biting enough ironic ad I could see us using that There also I posted some details in the forum of this contest.

673
00:42:08,842 --> 00:42:14,283
Speaker 0: obviously, I don't know contest laws, I don't have a lawyer I'm probably breaking laws in every state, but whatever.

674
00:42:14,866 --> 00:42:19,866
Speaker 0: and also You know the shapes and sizes of the ads are posted in the forum.

675
00:42:19,886 --> 00:42:28,494
Speaker 0: and also By submitting an ad to the contest you all you automatically release it into the Creative Commons license Which means we could use it.

676
00:42:28,614 --> 00:42:32,346
Speaker 0: Anyway, even if you don't win Creative Commons attribution, that's it.

677
00:42:32,506 --> 00:42:33,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

678
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:35,036
Speaker 0: Do you get credit for it?

679
00:42:35,176 --> 00:42:37,185
Speaker 1: No matter what one version of the Creative Commons?

680
00:42:37,205 --> 00:42:37,807
Speaker 0: Well, I think we're on 3.0 now.

681
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:44,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, whatever newest Creative Commons attribution license, you know, you don't really have a choice.

682
00:42:44,552 --> 00:42:46,641
Speaker 0: So and that's that's all we're gonna say about that.

683
00:42:46,962 --> 00:42:48,810
Speaker 1: All right, but you know stuff we're watching.

684
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,736
Speaker 1: I'm watching irresponsible captain Tyler again.

685
00:42:51,097 --> 00:42:52,181
Speaker 1: It's the fucking business.

686
00:42:52,341 --> 00:42:52,963
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

687
00:42:53,485 --> 00:42:55,070
Speaker 1: I can't express to you how great it is.

688
00:42:55,713 --> 00:42:59,330
Speaker 1: I'm finally watching Gurren Lagann, which is also pretty damn great.

689
00:42:59,350 --> 00:43:05,790
Speaker 1: However, I know the show takes it like the show is okay and then hits a point where suddenly it's great.

690
00:43:06,312 --> 00:43:14,669
Speaker 1: I do not believe I've hit that point yet and I'll tell you this Gurren Lagann fans If I have already hit that point and I don't think I have fuck that show.

691
00:43:15,750 --> 00:43:21,250
Speaker 1: But if the point is not yet come then that show might still be one of the better anime to come out ever.

692
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,333
Speaker 1: Uh-huh it.

693
00:43:22,754 --> 00:43:28,429
Speaker 1: the show has so much style going for it that that can make up for almost any problem that might occur.

694
00:43:29,011 --> 00:43:29,232
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

695
00:43:29,754 --> 00:43:30,837

00:44:01,587 --> 00:44:02,210
Speaker 1: I've been busy.

712
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:03,662
Speaker 1: I basically haven't been working on it.

713
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:04,186
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

714
00:44:04,751 --> 00:44:06,501
Speaker 1: So yeah, you act like you don't believe me.

715
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,009
Speaker 1: No, I really haven't been working on it.

716
00:44:10,091 --> 00:44:13,030
Speaker 0: Who's doing work and who's watching animes?

717
00:44:13,231 --> 00:44:18,510
Speaker 1: I believe if Scott Johnson pointed out in the forums because one of us has stuff to do outside I do stuff.

718
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,232
Speaker 0: What do I have?

719
00:44:19,252 --> 00:44:21,219
Speaker 0: we both do the same amount of stuff?

720
00:44:21,239 --> 00:44:21,941
Speaker 1: I think I do more.

721
00:44:21,961 --> 00:44:22,343
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

722
00:44:22,523 --> 00:44:27,370
Speaker 0: Okay anyway, so Actually, you know vertigo comics, right?

723
00:44:27,510 --> 00:44:35,449
Speaker 0: You know, they it's vertigo is DC if you don't realize this but you know They do the fables and the wide last man and you know the Sandman and all that stuff, right?

724
00:44:37,331 --> 00:44:39,040
Speaker 0: They're basically the way they sell comics.

725
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:50,151
Speaker 0: is they put out issues and they put out trades But the trades are always cheap and the first issue is always cheap Like the first issue of any vertigo series would be like a dollar and the first trade will always be like five dollars or seven Dollars.

726
00:44:50,172 --> 00:44:50,774
Speaker 0: we could cheap.

727
00:44:51,096 --> 00:44:55,615
Speaker 0: so they get you hooked and then you'll buy the rest of the trades at you know Regular prices.

728
00:44:55,695 --> 00:44:57,403
Speaker 0: now the thing is, you know a new.

729
00:44:57,443 --> 00:45:01,702
Speaker 0: whenever new vertigo series comes along I always get the first issue for like 25 cents cuz.

730
00:45:02,104 --> 00:45:04,553
Speaker 0: why the hell not, you know I'll go see what it's about.

731
00:45:05,356 --> 00:45:08,143
Speaker 0: and I read two new vertigo series recently.

732
00:45:08,184 --> 00:45:08,906
Speaker 0: the first issues.

733
00:45:09,467 --> 00:45:10,490
Speaker 0: one of them was Greek Street.

734
00:45:11,312 --> 00:45:12,338
Speaker 0: This was just terrible.

735
00:45:12,358 --> 00:45:14,090
Speaker 0: I don't know why anyone would like this.

736
00:45:14,271 --> 00:45:23,650
Speaker 0: It was basically the first story was about a guy who accidentally has sex with his mom And then there was a sorry edifice and then there was a story about some strippers.

737
00:45:24,094 --> 00:45:25,610
Speaker 0: Just I don't know what the hell was going on.

738
00:45:25,670 --> 00:45:28,930
Speaker 1: Are you sure that these aren't all modern retellings of old Greek tragedies?

739
00:45:29,872 --> 00:45:32,722
Speaker 1: It's possible that that sounds like that's what that's doing.

740
00:45:33,043 --> 00:45:33,304
Speaker 0: Right?

741
00:45:33,645 --> 00:45:34,789
Speaker 1: You probably just don't know.

742
00:45:36,132 --> 00:45:41,445
Speaker 0: Probably from something maybe but it was bad like it wasn't entertaining in and of itself.

743
00:45:41,526 --> 00:45:47,681
Speaker 0: and the third one then it was like some story with like some mafia dudes and I couldn't.

744
00:45:47,761 --> 00:45:50,588
Speaker 0: it was just complete trash and I was not interested.

745
00:45:51,189 --> 00:45:55,289
Speaker 0: but The the other series I read unwritten, right?

746
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:56,632
Speaker 0: Unwritten.

747
00:45:56,652 --> 00:46:06,450
Speaker 0: it was a really weird experience reading this thing because it was simultaneously so Cliche, but at the same time it was so unique and amazing, right?

748
00:46:07,190 --> 00:46:08,976
Speaker 0: It's like it starts off.

749
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:18,727
Speaker 0: you have this like guy at a convention and he's doing all like these autographs for people and he's famous And you slowly learn that what he's famous for is basically that his dad who's the lady who wrote Harry Potter.

750
00:46:19,369 --> 00:46:19,830
Speaker 0: What's her name?

751
00:46:20,031 --> 00:46:20,941
Speaker 1: I don't even know her name.

752
00:46:21,002 --> 00:46:21,710
Speaker 0: I forgot her name.

753
00:46:21,871 --> 00:46:25,049
Speaker 0: I could if you told it to me I'd be like that's the name but I can't come up with it right now.

754
00:46:26,312 --> 00:46:30,610
Speaker 0: But anyway, this dude's dad is the Harry Potter author, right?

755
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:34,250
Speaker 0: But his dad basically abandoned him and disappeared, right?

756
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:39,310
Speaker 0: He is right, but the Harry Potter character was supposedly modeled after him.

757
00:46:39,831 --> 00:46:46,776
Speaker 0: So as far as you know, people are concerned this guy, even though he's sort of like a grown-up 20-30 something year old dude.

758
00:46:47,197 --> 00:46:49,685
Speaker 0: He is the Harry Potter of this universe, right?

759
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:52,604
Speaker 0: Even though they don't use the words Harry Potter It's Harry Potter, right?

760
00:46:52,664 --> 00:46:53,431
Speaker 0: It's obvious They're.

761
00:46:53,592 --> 00:46:56,388
Speaker 0: it's intentionally right referenced and such.

762
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:59,203
Speaker 0: now The thing is right.

763
00:46:59,223 --> 00:47:06,190
Speaker 0: you're like, okay What kind of story is there to tell about this guy whose dad is the famous author who sold the most popular book?

764
00:47:06,651 --> 00:47:10,069
Speaker 1: Well missing dad is the premise of every Final Fantasy legend.

765
00:47:11,993 --> 00:47:13,305
Speaker 0: Now you're getting close to it.

766
00:47:14,352 --> 00:47:15,435
Speaker 0: basically, he's at the.

767
00:47:15,576 --> 00:47:15,877
Speaker 0: he's at.

768
00:47:15,917 --> 00:47:26,550
Speaker 0: he's on a panel at a convention right where all these fans are and One person stands up and is like, hey your birth certificate something something conspiracy, you know, who are you?

769
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:30,625
Speaker 0: You're not you know, actually the son of the author something something.

770
00:47:30,645 --> 00:47:42,828
Speaker 0: and then you know his agents like got to go to today, right and You find out that no He's probably not the son of this guy and his weird shit going on.

771
00:47:42,868 --> 00:47:46,541
Speaker 0: and you know What the wizard Harry Potter shit might be real.

772
00:47:46,621 --> 00:47:47,384
Speaker 0: and it's it gets.

773
00:47:47,825 --> 00:47:50,659
Speaker 0: it gets sort of crazy fucked up And there's only in the first issue, right?

774
00:47:50,679 --> 00:47:52,350
Speaker 0: So it's like 20 30 something pages.

775
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:53,935
Speaker 0: This isn't even the first trade paperback.

776
00:47:54,437 --> 00:47:57,106
Speaker 0: and I was like, whoa, what the hell is going on here?

777
00:47:57,648 --> 00:47:58,229
Speaker 0: What is this?

778
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:07,910
Speaker 0: So even though I'm like, you know, not a not interested in Harry Potter at all, right this Unwritten from vertigo is looking pretty interesting.

779
00:48:07,930 --> 00:48:14,990
Speaker 0: I'm going to be getting some first trade paperback action, which is why it's very awesome that they have one dollar issue number ones.

780
00:48:16,071 --> 00:48:19,968
Speaker 1: So, yeah, yep, so one other thing before it and this so I can you know go to work.

781
00:48:20,309 --> 00:48:25,628
Speaker 1: now I've got the box set and after I finish captain Tyler, I think I'm finally gonna sit down and watch it.

782
00:48:26,271 --> 00:48:29,280
Speaker 1: Well, I am also, you know watching Legend of the Galactic Heroes.

783
00:48:29,561 --> 00:48:30,002
Speaker 0: Good God.

784
00:48:30,062 --> 00:48:31,326
Speaker 1: That show is pretty great.

785
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:32,450
Speaker 0: How many episodes is that?

786
00:48:33,730 --> 00:48:34,253
Speaker 1: Infinity.

787
00:48:34,293 --> 00:48:35,661
Speaker 1: it's like a hundred hits a lot.

788
00:48:35,681 --> 00:48:37,290
Speaker 1: I don't even have all of it.

789
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:38,494
Speaker 1: I only have like the first ten.

790
00:48:38,534 --> 00:48:39,979
Speaker 1: I'll have to get the rest somewhere.

791
00:48:40,682 --> 00:48:53,307
Speaker 1: but Nadesha co is like the one Show from the era that it came out that I did not watch, you know, I started, you know back a while I saw like the first D evil the first VHS worth of it dubbed.

792
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:54,110
Speaker 1: I never saw any more.

793
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:58,023
Speaker 0: Yeah I converted it all to iPod for iPhone format and I started watching it.

794
00:48:58,645 --> 00:49:00,454
Speaker 0: and I just I just never like.

795
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:06,680
Speaker 0: I watched a few episodes and I was like And I just stopped side, you know It didn't it didn't grab me.

796
00:49:06,741 --> 00:49:13,524
Speaker 1: and like the first four or five I'm going to watch solely because it was fairly enduringly popular from the time.

797
00:49:14,045 --> 00:49:15,469
Speaker 1: so there's got to be something to it.

798
00:49:15,774 --> 00:49:22,137
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean even for Shiggy Yugi was very popular when it came out and while it faded I can see why it was worth watching The first season of that.

799
00:49:22,177 --> 00:49:23,709
Speaker 1: so I got to see what the deal is.

800
00:49:24,032 --> 00:49:26,249
Speaker 0: I also will eventually see what the deal is.

801
00:49:26,370 --> 00:49:27,214
Speaker 1: The thing is if it.

802
00:49:27,354 --> 00:49:29,906
Speaker 1: if it is what I think it is Gurren Lagann just did it better.

803
00:49:29,926 --> 00:49:32,255
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't like I died.

804
00:49:32,355 --> 00:49:33,581
Speaker 0: I haven't seen either of the two.

805
00:49:33,601 --> 00:49:35,430
Speaker 0: So how would I even know if they were you really gonna watch?

806
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:37,941
Speaker 1: I mean, this is a show that has the.

807
00:49:38,343 --> 00:49:43,228
Speaker 1: if you ever hear people quoting the line Don't believe in yourself believe in the me that believes in you.

808
00:49:43,449 --> 00:49:46,481
Speaker 1: Yeah Stuff like that is from Gurren Lagann.

809
00:49:46,501 --> 00:49:48,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, that doesn't excite me.

810
00:49:48,911 --> 00:49:49,955
Speaker 1: How can that not excite you?

811
00:49:50,015 --> 00:49:52,244
Speaker 0: because every time someone says that it's just.

812
00:49:52,344 --> 00:49:53,790
Speaker 0: it's just like what the fuck is wrong with you.

813
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:54,573
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

814
00:49:54,594 --> 00:49:57,989
Speaker 1: That's that is perhaps the most inspirational thing you can say to anyone ever.

815
00:49:59,471 --> 00:50:00,294
Speaker 0: It's just really corny.

816
00:50:00,314 --> 00:50:02,643
Speaker 1: If you ask me, it's supposed the whole show is corny.

817
00:50:02,743 --> 00:50:03,667
Speaker 1: It's epically corny.

818
00:50:03,948 --> 00:50:04,470
Speaker 0: It's corny.

819
00:50:04,691 --> 00:50:05,234
Speaker 0: So you like that.

820
00:50:05,254 --> 00:50:11,379
Speaker 1: if you don't like Stan Lee cuz it's corny in the read or die way Uh-huh, or in the giant orobo way.

821
00:50:12,221 --> 00:50:14,869
Speaker 1: if they don't and characters don't say what they're doing as they do it.

822
00:50:16,293 --> 00:50:17,426
Speaker 1: Well, they kind of do.

823
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:24,283
Speaker 0: Well, it's okay if it's rocket punch.

824
00:50:24,303 --> 00:50:33,629
Speaker 0: if someone else at the narrator says rocket punch You know if or if you say rocket punch like after it hits like fuck Got you in the face you piece of shit, right?

825
00:50:33,970 --> 00:50:34,653
Speaker 1: What if you're in the robot?

826
00:50:34,673 --> 00:50:37,665
Speaker 1: you'll rock it's a pod and then the rocket punch comes out.

827
00:50:37,725 --> 00:50:40,052
Speaker 0: That's not as good All right.

828
00:50:40,133 --> 00:50:42,121
Speaker 1: At any rate the show is kind of rambling.

829
00:50:42,462 --> 00:50:43,085
Speaker 1: I'm tired.

830
00:50:43,386 --> 00:50:43,969
