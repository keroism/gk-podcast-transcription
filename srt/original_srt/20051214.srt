1
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:12,820
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday December 14th, and this is geek nights.

2
00:00:13,681 --> 00:00:17,799
Speaker 1: We're not really gonna talk about much because today sucked, but there is some anime news.

3
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,446
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,169 --> 00:00:27,080
Speaker 0: So, uh, we've been sitting here for the last hour and There's nothing to talk about today at all.

5
00:00:28,207 --> 00:00:28,820
Speaker 1: He ain't kidding.

6
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it's anime day.

7
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:38,780
Speaker 0: Normally, we have a lot to talk about but we haven't gotten any Netflix's in to watch yet because we've been busy doing other things.

8
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:40,448
Speaker 1: Netflix has been a little slow.

9
00:00:40,468 --> 00:00:41,633
Speaker 0: Yes, suddenly.

10
00:00:41,653 --> 00:00:45,609
Speaker 0: I don't know if anyone else is having trouble But Netflix suddenly just slowed the fuck down.

11
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, hopefully they'll pick back up soon.

12
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:50,387
Speaker 0: Yeah But anime news.

13
00:00:50,407 --> 00:00:57,560
Speaker 0: we got a bunch of that because it's anime day and we can talk about it But there's really nothing else that either we have interesting commentary on or that you would care about.

14
00:00:58,225 --> 00:01:08,220
Speaker 1: I mean if you don't believe me go look at the headlines on the geek news sites for Wednesday, December 14th and You're gonna see some pretty dumb crap.

15
00:01:09,302 --> 00:01:09,986
Speaker 0: Mean, all right here.

16
00:01:10,047 --> 00:01:12,360
Speaker 0: Let's all look through some of these headlines on slashdot.

17
00:01:13,122 --> 00:01:15,729
Speaker 0: So IBM promotes Linux partners to highest here.

18
00:01:16,491 --> 00:01:20,040
Speaker 0: Well, I work for IBM and that stuff doesn't really mean anything.

19
00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:24,319
Speaker 1: Yep, let's let's find another one that has a whole lot of comments.

20
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,224
Speaker 1: Alright, here's one new object found at edge of solar system Great on Pluto.

21
00:01:31,846 --> 00:01:35,176
Speaker 0: So, uh, people have been saying that off and on a lot for a long time.

22
00:01:35,196 --> 00:01:38,766
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm And we're not gonna get there anytime soon.

23
00:01:39,207 --> 00:01:41,052
Speaker 1: No, it's just a rock means nothing.

24
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:48,431
Speaker 1: Oh, here's one of the whole lot of comments Cyberattacks on us linked to Chinese military, huh?

25
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:51,460
Speaker 0: China would have a vested interest in attacking u.s.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,683
Speaker 0: IT infrastructure.

27
00:01:52,703 --> 00:01:53,827
Speaker 1: Yeah, they do.

28
00:01:54,128 --> 00:01:54,369
Speaker 1: Huh?

29
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:57,500
Speaker 0: Fancy that I never would have guessed me either.

30
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:00,860
Speaker 0: Oh Star Wars galaxies.

31
00:02:01,362 --> 00:02:04,735
Speaker 0: Apparently Lucas arts broke it and the fans are all complaining.

32
00:02:04,755 --> 00:02:06,040
Speaker 1: I would complain too.

33
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:07,789
Speaker 1: They friggin changed the game.

34
00:02:07,849 --> 00:02:09,074
Speaker 1: It's not the same game you bought.

35
00:02:09,196 --> 00:02:09,960
Speaker 1: It's like come on, man.

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:16,904
Speaker 0: the thing is I have no sympathy for the people playing it because if you like if you're playing a game you're paying for it and They change it.

37
00:02:16,924 --> 00:02:17,788
Speaker 0: You don't like it anymore.

38
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,115
Speaker 0: Stop paying.

39
00:02:19,296 --> 00:02:20,140
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah keep paying.

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,040
Speaker 1: You're just rewarding them for hurting you know, wait Lucas seems to have a trend of making things and then changing them later.

41
00:02:26,564 --> 00:02:27,592
Speaker 0: Oh who shot first?

42
00:02:27,995 --> 00:02:28,579
Speaker 1: I don't know.

43
00:02:29,142 --> 00:02:33,240
Speaker 1: I forget because he changed every copy of the film except for the ones that we have.

44
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:39,900
Speaker 0: You cannot take them and let this go down into posterity in case you're centuries or millennia from now.

45
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:46,440
Speaker 0: Archaeologists discover this show and they listen to it no matter what evidence you find to the contrary.

46
00:02:46,962 --> 00:02:48,468
Speaker 0: Han Solo shot first.

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:52,583
Speaker 1: not only did he shoot first Greedo didn't shoot at all He just slumped over.

48
00:02:52,603 --> 00:02:56,456
Speaker 1: Yep, and there was an explosion of smoke from under the table to signify this.

49
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,795
Speaker 0: Oh The Dungeons & Dragons online MMO moved from alpha to beta.

50
00:03:01,815 --> 00:03:06,429
Speaker 0: Yep exciting Almost everyone who plays it says it sucks.

51
00:03:06,911 --> 00:03:07,272
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

52
00:03:07,313 --> 00:03:08,035
Speaker 1: I just had a vision.

53
00:03:08,055 --> 00:03:09,059
Speaker 1: we had to go back a little bit.

54
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,106
Speaker 1: Uh, you know, who's that guy?

55
00:03:11,146 --> 00:03:19,218
Speaker 1: Charlton Heston, right and he holds the gun and he says from my cold dead hands Yeah, replace a gun with with a Star Wars DVD.

56
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:19,680
Speaker 1: That's correct.

57
00:03:23,047 --> 00:03:24,419
Speaker 0: We should do that we should.

58
00:03:26,441 --> 00:03:31,176
Speaker 0: But uh the D&D online MMO, I mean I was really excited about it when I first heard.

59
00:03:31,196 --> 00:03:32,300
Speaker 1: I wasn't excited at all.

60
00:03:32,380 --> 00:03:33,145
Speaker 0: I know there's like.

61
00:03:33,225 --> 00:03:34,834
Speaker 0: I was excited in an optimistic.

62
00:03:35,095 --> 00:03:35,960
Speaker 0: if they do this, right?

63
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:36,844
Speaker 0: It would be awesome.

64
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:38,130
Speaker 0: And you know what they didn't do it, right?

65
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,120
Speaker 1: I don't think it can be done, right?

66
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:43,436
Speaker 0: Yeah, I could if you said because there were services a long time ago.

67
00:03:43,456 --> 00:03:53,127
Speaker 0: We're basically Yeah, there was a bunch of dungeon master types who ran the game and they just played NPCs and ran content for all the players And it was just this role-playing thing.

68
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:58,151
Speaker 0: That's not a D&D MMO Why not Dungeons & Dragons?

69
00:03:58,212 --> 00:03:59,440
Speaker 0: and it's massively multiplayer.

70
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:09,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you have a thousand DMS playing NPCs and just running plots for whatever players are in the game all the time And you happen to use the D&D rules can't make that work.

71
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:11,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, you could.

72
00:04:11,246 --> 00:04:13,759
Speaker 0: the problem is it'd be expensive because you have to hire all those DMS.

73
00:04:14,861 --> 00:04:16,447
Speaker 1: Even so it wouldn't work.

74
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:16,909
Speaker 0: Actually.

75
00:04:16,949 --> 00:04:17,430
Speaker 0: It did work.

76
00:04:17,451 --> 00:04:19,057
Speaker 0: There are a lot of games like that in the 90s.

77
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,334
Speaker 1: Yeah, each game was like five people now.

78
00:04:23,394 --> 00:04:27,120
Speaker 0: No, no, no, no, no, actually I'll if you want since I don't have the rest.

79
00:04:27,242 --> 00:04:32,620
Speaker 0: I don't have it handy now But I'll because I used to play a bunch of them and the more popular ones had a couple hundred people.

80
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,152
Speaker 1: All right, now do that with 50,000 people.

81
00:04:35,761 --> 00:04:38,512
Speaker 0: Well 50,000 altogether means you have a lot more money.

82
00:04:38,773 --> 00:04:40,360
Speaker 0: So you hire a lot more dungeon masters.

83
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,700
Speaker 1: Alright, but now what you're gonna do is you're gonna raise any to pay those dungeon masters.

84
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,579
Speaker 1: You're not gonna be able to compete with other MMOs and charge a reason.

85
00:04:48,599 --> 00:04:51,252
Speaker 0: Oh Well, yeah, the thing is it'd be so much better.

86
00:04:51,332 --> 00:04:52,498
Speaker 0: Maybe people be willing to pay.

87
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:55,868
Speaker 0: No, it wouldn't work, yeah, you don't know.

88
00:04:55,888 --> 00:04:57,233
Speaker 1: you know what.

89
00:04:57,855 --> 00:05:02,520
Speaker 1: even if people are willing to pay There won't be enough people willing to pay that much money.

90
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:06,000
Speaker 1: You won't recruit the development cost of developing the game in the first place.

91
00:05:06,181 --> 00:05:10,180
Speaker 0: There might not be so much to develop other than things that we could just do here in our spare time.

92
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:19,240
Speaker 1: No making a game that you can sell these days like millions and millions of dollars At least if you wanted to be published by a major publisher.

93
00:05:19,521 --> 00:05:23,659
Speaker 1: Sure that if you're gonna have a D&D license which costs a lot of money you're gonna need to do.

94
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,370
Speaker 0: You know that alone doesn't have to be specifically D&D.

95
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:26,952
Speaker 0: I use D.

96
00:05:26,972 --> 00:05:27,876
Speaker 1: Well, there's the problem.

97
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:28,820
Speaker 1: It's a D&D MMO.

98
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:29,683
Speaker 1: That's what it is.

99
00:05:30,205 --> 00:05:30,686
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

100
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,349
Speaker 0: It's it's nothing.

101
00:05:31,389 --> 00:05:34,018
Speaker 0: It's just a crap MMO that happens to be attached to D&D.

102
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:35,220
Speaker 1: That's what I said.

103
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:40,040
Speaker 1: That's why I said it was crap in the first place with other people because it had the D&D license thought it was so great.

104
00:05:40,362 --> 00:05:42,332
Speaker 1: Well, I said because it has the D&D licenses.

105
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:43,700
Speaker 0: Oh, doesn't that make you special?

106
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:46,430
Speaker 1: It does because I know what's crap and what's not see.

107
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:48,820
Speaker 0: the thing is you said it was crap before we knew anything about it.

108
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:49,684
Speaker 0: I said, I don't know.

109
00:05:49,725 --> 00:05:50,227
Speaker 0: I hope it's good.

110
00:05:50,247 --> 00:05:52,499
Speaker 1: I knew it had a D&D license and I knew there was an MMO.

111
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:54,151
Speaker 1: That's all I needed to know.

112
00:05:54,292 --> 00:05:55,360
Speaker 0: So I hoped it would be good.

113
00:05:55,681 --> 00:05:59,794
Speaker 1: There is no way to make an MMO with the D. hoped hoped wait.

114
00:05:59,814 --> 00:06:00,937
Speaker 0: So you're saying there's no way.

115
00:06:00,977 --> 00:06:01,800
Speaker 0: you're absolutely sir.

116
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:06,355
Speaker 1: There is no way to make an MMORPG with the D&D license.

117
00:06:06,656 --> 00:06:07,860
Speaker 1: That also does not suck.

118
00:06:08,142 --> 00:06:08,404
Speaker 0: You know.

119
00:06:08,647 --> 00:06:11,065
Speaker 0: once again because he didn't listen to me I meant D&D.

120
00:06:11,105 --> 00:06:13,637
Speaker 0: when I say D&D I mean role-playing is a generic sense.

121
00:06:13,717 --> 00:06:14,320
Speaker 0: I use that word there.

122
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:16,186
Speaker 0: I use Kleenex our band-aid.

123
00:06:16,587 --> 00:06:17,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'd use GURPS.

124
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,880
Speaker 0: you could use any number of a million systems that work just fine.

125
00:06:21,141 --> 00:06:26,217
Speaker 1: But we this one we knew that had the D&D system and therefore I knew that it would suck.

126
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:30,492
Speaker 1: Okay And I was right great.

127
00:06:31,196 --> 00:06:31,820
Speaker 1: That's what I was saying.

128
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:39,965
Speaker 1: Fear appear anyway, there's other crap news Here this one.

129
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,133

Speaker 1: yeah today The news tap had just like molasses coming out.

134
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:58,434
Speaker 0: Well, there's real news in the real world, but you guys know all about that.

135
00:06:58,514 --> 00:07:02,314
Speaker 1: Anyway, yeah We don't want to become a real news show.

136
00:07:02,636 --> 00:07:04,545
Speaker 1: Yeah All right.

137
00:07:04,948 --> 00:07:06,639
Speaker 1: So let's get right on into it.

138
00:07:07,901 --> 00:07:08,562
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

139
00:07:18,198 --> 00:07:18,598
Speaker 0: All right.

140
00:07:18,618 --> 00:07:21,046
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day This isn't a cool thing.

141
00:07:21,127 --> 00:07:26,219
Speaker 0: Like I usually have or a cute thing or an interesting thing Something that ticked me off a lot.

142
00:07:27,122 --> 00:07:32,619
Speaker 0: Now actually if you read the site, it's it actually is interesting because you'll wonder how could people believe this.

143
00:07:33,821 --> 00:07:36,731
Speaker 0: but basically about.com and it's good this is good.

144
00:07:36,751 --> 00:07:42,579
Speaker 0: This is all over dig and it's all over delicious and It just it frightens me that people are so interested in this.

145
00:07:43,101 --> 00:07:55,840
Speaker 0: but basically this article is the ten most puzzling ancient artifacts and It brings up all these Supposedly unexplained weird phenomena all over the world that prove like aliens exist or whatever.

146
00:07:56,301 --> 00:07:59,455
Speaker 1: Well, if it's just an artifact, no, no, no, they're not.

147
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,258
Speaker 0: I'll get I'll explain All right.

148
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:17,540
Speaker 0: So one of them are these grooves fears that people claim they've been finding in like South African mines like inside of fossils and inside of ancient rocks recently and They claim that they're dated to you know, 2.8 billion years ago, but they look man-made.

149
00:08:18,543 --> 00:08:21,594
Speaker 0: The problem is they don't say that they've never been tested.

150
00:08:21,694 --> 00:08:23,260
Speaker 0: No one's ever actually touched these things.

151
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:27,839
Speaker 0: They're described as composed of a solid bluish metal with flecks of white.

152
00:08:29,022 --> 00:08:35,419
Speaker 0: Because I'm sure if a scientist, you know tested one of these things He couldn't tell you that it was just a piece of metal or what kind of metal it was.

153
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:38,630
Speaker 1: Hmm, and they've never actually done a carbon test.

154
00:08:39,152 --> 00:08:41,220
Speaker 0: You can't carbon test inorganic Scott.

155
00:08:41,722 --> 00:08:42,505
Speaker 1: Oh, I didn't know.

156
00:08:42,666 --> 00:08:45,539
Speaker 0: carbon-type dating is actually kind of crappy for most things.

157
00:08:46,962 --> 00:08:49,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, but they're just or like these dropa stones.

158
00:08:49,776 --> 00:08:50,519
Speaker 0: these are even worse.

159
00:08:51,520 --> 00:09:21,099
Speaker 0: Basically to some of these are some spirits like disc shaped stones that have some markings on them and this crackpot Scientists claims that they the the markings on them which are almost microscopic are actually this ancient alien language that he was able to translate and apparently it depicts Alien ships that crashed on earth of these people called the dropa and whose descendants left them in this cave Except that one.

160
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:24,969
Speaker 0: These were totally debunked, you know dozens and dozens of times.

161
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,124
Speaker 0: and to the guy who talks about him sells them Sells them sells them.

162
00:09:30,144 --> 00:09:31,066
Speaker 0: you can buy them from him.

163
00:09:31,086 --> 00:09:32,309
Speaker 1: Does he have an infinite supply?

164
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:32,850
Speaker 0: I don't know.

165
00:09:33,769 --> 00:09:40,900
Speaker 1: the only Because if it was like if it was really Stones from aliens you imagine there's only a few of them and he doesn't have so many.

166
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:49,600
Speaker 0: Oh, we've got a whole bunch of them hundreds of stone discs Hundreds of me buried in the dust of ages on the cave so we can somehow buy them all and then he wouldn't have anymore.

167
00:09:50,462 --> 00:09:56,120
Speaker 0: The only other person who has ever even made reference to these things in a positive light is the scientist who?

168
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,270
Speaker 0: Surprisingly enough also sells them.

169
00:09:59,377 --> 00:10:10,378
Speaker 0: Oh Only of the ten things on this site seven of them have been 100% fully and beyond a reasonable doubt debunked by science.

170
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,963
Speaker 0: Wow And what?

171
00:10:12,004 --> 00:10:14,933
Speaker 0: the only one that's even legitimate is the Baghdad battery, which?

172
00:10:15,134 --> 00:10:16,097
Speaker 1: what's the Baghdad battery?

173
00:10:16,257 --> 00:10:16,980
Speaker 0: It was a battery.

174
00:10:17,221 --> 00:10:22,467
Speaker 0: Well, it was a an artifact that was found a while ago in Around where Baghdad is today.

175
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,120
Speaker 0: All right, and it was basically a battery.

176
00:10:25,682 --> 00:10:36,980
Speaker 0: It was a clay pot with a rod through it and it basically if you fill it with an acidic or an alkaline liquid It generated a small current and it looks like they used it in ancient times to electroplate things with various metals like gold.

177
00:10:37,702 --> 00:10:38,245
Speaker 1: That makes sense.

178
00:10:38,445 --> 00:10:42,140
Speaker 1: Yeah, why is that an unexplained artifact?

179
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:52,220
Speaker 0: Because they talk about oh, how come humans had batteries so long ago And then they didn't have many more than they rediscovered them because they didn't realize that it was electricity in a battery.

180
00:10:52,321 --> 00:10:55,860
Speaker 1: And they they just knew that it was a way to plate things and they didn't realize that.

181
00:10:57,026 --> 00:11:00,569
Speaker 0: The issue was that in the Middle Ages They didn't have electroplating or anything.

182
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:10,167
Speaker 1: The knowledge was lost, you know Dark Ages Maybe the knowledge is lost but also it could have been that just people didn't want to plate things anymore So they didn't do it in those forgot.

183
00:11:10,668 --> 00:11:14,782
Speaker 0: No, most likely the knowledge was just lost during the Dark Ages Hmm.

184
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:21,560
Speaker 1: Yeah, but oh it could have been like one asshole came up with electroplating because we've only found one battery, right?

185
00:11:22,461 --> 00:11:23,687
Speaker 0: I believe they found more since then.

186
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:25,756
Speaker 0: There's actually a lot of cool articles on these batteries.

187
00:11:25,997 --> 00:11:31,922
Speaker 1: No, that's pretty cool Alright, but if it was like just a few it could have been like one asshole figured it out and didn't tell anyone and then He died.

188
00:11:32,383 --> 00:11:35,916
Speaker 0: Well considering the preponderance of electroplated artifacts from that era.

189
00:11:35,936 --> 00:11:37,668
Speaker 1: Oh All right, then.

190
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,989
Speaker 0: Yeah mine and Similar things have been found in other older ancient cultures.

191
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:43,494
Speaker 1: Just just guessing possibility.

192
00:11:43,534 --> 00:11:45,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, but pretty much everything else on this website.

193
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,524
Speaker 0: It's just complete bullshit.

194
00:11:47,227 --> 00:11:51,020
Speaker 1: I'm sure Randy will find out about it and make a nice little yeah on Friday.

195
00:11:51,743 --> 00:11:54,153
Speaker 0: So I urge all of you out there who use delicious.

196
00:11:54,554 --> 00:11:58,280
Speaker 0: if you see things like this You know, that's just obviously false.

197
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:00,859
Speaker 0: Tag it with the flim-flam tag.

198
00:12:01,211 --> 00:12:01,420
Speaker 1: Yeah.

199
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:06,197
Speaker 1: And if you want to see a list of things that are false just go to delicious slash tag.

200
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:10,090
Speaker 1: slash flim-flam One word all one word FLIM FLAM.

201
00:12:10,251 --> 00:12:13,080
Speaker 1: Yep, and you'll see all kinds of things that are bullshit.

202
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:18,164
Speaker 1: So if you see something and you're not sure if it's quite right or not You can ask Randy.

203
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,780
Speaker 1: you can go search his site or you can check delicious flim-flam and see if we've found it.

204
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:35,179
Speaker 1: Also because we might have and tagged it now Randy of course being James Randy the founder and leader of the James Randy Educational Foundation, which is the premier organization for finding complete bullshit like this and pointing it out.

205
00:12:35,904 --> 00:12:40,411
Speaker 0: We're going to do a whole show on Randy at some point And actually we're gonna try to interview him if we can.

206
00:12:40,511 --> 00:12:42,240
Speaker 0: but that's down the road way down the road.

207
00:12:43,562 --> 00:12:45,314
Speaker 1: All right, my thing of the day.

208
00:12:45,334 --> 00:12:49,838
Speaker 1: Yeah If you're in prison, they don't let you have so much stuff.

209
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:58,407
Speaker 1: They really only let you have what your clothes Like some plastic Utensils in the kitchen.

210
00:12:58,467 --> 00:12:59,431
Speaker 0: prison ain't so bad.

211
00:12:59,451 --> 00:13:03,772
Speaker 0: You can make sangria in the toilet Of course, it's shank or be shanked.

212
00:13:04,174 --> 00:13:13,439
Speaker 1: Oh, of course Yeah, if you drama anyway You know you get a towel get a roll of toilet paper Maybe a plastic bag.

213
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:15,477
Speaker 1: You know, you don't get a lot of stuff.

214
00:13:16,646 --> 00:13:31,049
Speaker 1: so Prisoners who need things or want things And having a lot of time to think about things are really good at finding ingenious ways to combine normal everyday items into other objects.

215
00:13:31,069 --> 00:13:44,635
Speaker 1: and there is in fact websites and other things devoted to collections of interesting and intuitive and ingenuity prisoner inventions and Some of them are actually really cool.

216
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:47,914
Speaker 0: Then you give us an example.

217
00:13:48,175 --> 00:13:52,848
Speaker 1: Well, some guys made a chess set by carving out pieces of soap into pieces.

218
00:13:53,289 --> 00:14:09,132
Speaker 1: All right another guy took a roll a plastic bag and he rolled some You know a towel around it and he turned it into sort of like Like a love buddy Great.

219
00:14:09,514 --> 00:14:12,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, I need you to steal a banana from the cafeteria.

220
00:14:12,725 --> 00:14:20,665
Speaker 1: I Don't know Because it's shank or be shanked, of course, of course All right, here we go.

221
00:14:22,013 --> 00:14:25,770
Speaker 1: They also made a cigarette lighter out of almost nothing.

222
00:14:26,733 --> 00:14:27,095
Speaker 0: What do you mean?

223
00:14:27,115 --> 00:14:28,480
Speaker 0: almost nothing like out of the air?

224
00:14:29,021 --> 00:14:29,323
Speaker 1: All right.

225
00:14:29,363 --> 00:14:33,788
Speaker 1: Well, it's a couple paper clips, right and You know.

226
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:58,310
Speaker 1: he took some ice cream spoons and he glued them together with paper clips in them to make a plug that can go into the outlet in the wall and Then he you know, he had more paper clips coming out going into a saltwater solution and Get the electricity and use that to light cigarettes, you know, because there was a little where the paperclip came out.

227
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:58,752
Speaker 1: There was a little.

228
00:14:58,932 --> 00:15:00,740
Speaker 1: he made a little coily bit and it heated up.

229
00:15:01,831 --> 00:15:06,790
Speaker 1: He could also plug devices into it if he had a you know, something that plugged into the wall.

230
00:15:07,691 --> 00:15:08,394
Speaker 1: That's pretty cool.

231
00:15:08,634 --> 00:15:08,976
Speaker 0: Aha.

232
00:15:09,558 --> 00:15:12,690
Speaker 1: I mean I wouldn't have the balls to stick paper clips into the outlet in the wall.

233
00:15:13,415 --> 00:15:20,786
Speaker 0: Trying to make a thing to light cigarettes In power devices and being shocked by a hundred and ten volts isn't so bad.

234
00:15:20,806 --> 00:15:22,990
Speaker 1: Isn't it 120?

235
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:25,784
Speaker 0: Actually, there's a lot of it's 110 and it's 120. awesome.

236
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:38,656
Speaker 0: it can be anywhere between because it's actually neither and Depending on what school electricity you went to or just where you live people say 110 220 or 120 240 Not bad.

237
00:15:38,838 --> 00:15:41,514
Speaker 0: It's pretty much 50/50 Half.

238
00:15:41,575 --> 00:15:43,409
Speaker 0: maybe we'll do a show about that if we get bored enough.

239
00:15:44,431 --> 00:15:46,037
Speaker 1: Yeah, but that's pretty crazy.

240
00:15:46,077 --> 00:15:54,345
Speaker 0: making a cigarette lighter that plugs into the wall out of paper clips Wow, so I guess prisoners aren't stupid or at least they're canny like animals.

241
00:15:54,466 --> 00:15:58,036
Speaker 1: Well, some of them are Not stupid.

242
00:15:58,137 --> 00:16:00,070
Speaker 0: well considering that most people in prison in the u.s.

243
00:16:00,110 --> 00:16:03,250
Speaker 0: Today are in there for nonviolent crimes that didn't hurt anyone but themselves.

244
00:16:03,891 --> 00:16:10,098
Speaker 0: yeah, it's you know smoking a little bit of marijuana or Being a dissident everything sucks.

245
00:16:10,902 --> 00:16:11,163
Speaker 0: Yeah.

246
00:16:11,283 --> 00:16:14,134
Speaker 0: Yeah sucks looks like Mostly just cuz.

247
00:16:14,154 --> 00:16:16,869
Speaker 0: we got nothing to talk about today and this is like the worst show we've done yet.

248
00:16:18,231 --> 00:16:20,964
Speaker 1: Yeah, now I see why a lot of people don't do the daily shows.

249
00:16:20,984 --> 00:16:26,574
Speaker 0: I Promise we'll have better tomorrow at least guaranteed, yeah Really?

250
00:16:26,675 --> 00:16:28,110
Speaker 1: Cuz something has to happen tomorrow.

251
00:16:29,711 --> 00:16:33,649
Speaker 1: But I guess I never really thought about like this, you know, it feels like there's always something happening.

252
00:16:34,373 --> 00:16:37,130
Speaker 1: So I never really imagined that there would be a day where nothing happened.

253
00:16:37,652 --> 00:16:40,970
Speaker 0: At least nothing happened that we can really talk about on the show that you'll care about.

254
00:16:41,311 --> 00:16:42,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean lots of stuff happened.

255
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:45,410
Speaker 0: Iran said the Holocaust didn't happen.

256
00:16:46,211 --> 00:16:47,656
Speaker 0: Tookie Williams got executed.

257
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,522
Speaker 0: There's riots all over Sydney.

258
00:16:49,582 --> 00:16:57,365
Speaker 0: There's the riots in France were going on, but They're still going on in France not per se but there's still a lot of racial violence going on.

259
00:16:57,425 --> 00:16:59,050
Speaker 0: is the aftermath great?

260
00:16:59,993 --> 00:17:00,688
Speaker 1: Yeah, great.

261
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:03,817
Speaker 0: So anyway, it's anime day Mm-hmm.

262
00:17:05,571 --> 00:17:07,898
Speaker 0: Any new anime except mushishi, which we're still watching.

263
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,185
Speaker 1: She's great waiting for episode eight.

264
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:10,747
Speaker 1: I think now.

265
00:17:10,787 --> 00:17:12,574
Speaker 1: Yeah Mmm.

266
00:17:13,397 --> 00:17:13,780
Speaker 1: All right.

267
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:15,890
Speaker 0: So, uh remember Shinsen subs.

268
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:17,817
Speaker 0: We talked about them last anime day.

269
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:21,388
Speaker 1: how funimation went and harassed them and said hey stop torrenting.

270
00:17:21,810 --> 00:17:23,976
Speaker 0: Well, we got a follow-up as to why that happened.

271
00:17:24,538 --> 00:17:25,520
Speaker 1: Well it bears.

272
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:32,202
Speaker 1: apparently Shinsen was actually still distributing many licensed Available things.

273
00:17:32,546 --> 00:17:34,888
Speaker 1: Oh So they deserve what they got.

274
00:17:35,695 --> 00:17:41,201
Speaker 0: Yeah, I Mean, I guess it's one of the standpoints of the anime community.

275
00:17:41,763 --> 00:17:43,910
Speaker 0: Is that the piracy is there?

276
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:51,539
Speaker 0: There's a lot of piracy But ever there's kind of this code of honor where most people stop distributing or stop Downloading and the DVDs still get bought.

277
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,670
Speaker 0: everyone makes their money and no one goes after anyone.

278
00:17:54,494 --> 00:17:58,010
Speaker 0: When a group like Shinsen kind of breaks the code bad things happen.

279
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,494
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

280
00:17:59,936 --> 00:18:02,809
Speaker 0: It's a delicate balance and frankly I want to keep getting my fans up.

281
00:18:02,869 --> 00:18:05,037
Speaker 0: so Bad fans arbors out there.

282
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:05,600
Speaker 0: Stop it.

283
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,450
Speaker 1: It's like the code of the schoolyard.

284
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:12,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know you you might be able to break the code of the schoolyard and you know You'll.

285
00:18:12,631 --> 00:18:17,649
Speaker 1: you'll screw things up and you might get ahead on that but later everyone will come and destroy you.

286
00:18:18,714 --> 00:18:23,337
Speaker 1: So I highly don't recommend Doing that though actually some cool news.

287
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:28,955
Speaker 0: Viz is putting out their signature collection of manga in other words The manga that Scott likes.

288
00:18:29,297 --> 00:18:30,321
Speaker 0: Yeah, they cut.

289
00:18:30,342 --> 00:18:33,893
Speaker 0: they say it's going to be a more sophisticated Mature manga.

290
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:46,130
Speaker 1: so they used to have the editors choice manga and that would be all the really cool mangas that Weren't crazy popular or well-known, but they were like the ultra high quality, you know kind of like Citizen Kane.

291
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,360
Speaker 1: No one really likes to watch it, but it's really good.

292
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:49,566
Speaker 0: I like to watch it.

293
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,249
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

294
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:53,582
Speaker 1: It's not really as entertaining as like the matrix.

295
00:18:53,763 --> 00:18:55,170
Speaker 1: I could watch the matrix a hundred times.

296
00:18:55,230 --> 00:18:57,058
Speaker 1: I could not watch citizen Kane nearly as many times.

297
00:18:57,119 --> 00:18:59,630
Speaker 0: I could probably watch citizen Kane more than I could watch the matrix.

298
00:19:00,652 --> 00:19:01,056
Speaker 1: We not that.

299
00:19:01,177 --> 00:19:07,027
Speaker 1: well, I'm talking about the first one only here All right, but I mean I could watch the first matrix a bajillion times and every time.

300
00:19:07,369 --> 00:19:09,798
Speaker 1: yeah Well, that's you know, that's how it is.

301
00:19:09,818 --> 00:19:16,231
Speaker 1: But anyway, these are like the high quality mangas of awesome like Phoenix.

302
00:19:16,794 --> 00:19:19,650
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I got the first volumes of Phoenix from the editors choice printing.

303
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:21,477
Speaker 1: I'm kind of disappointed that they're gonna reprint it.

304
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:25,170
Speaker 1: I'm wondering if they're gonna reprint the Phoenix that was never printed yet.

305
00:19:25,672 --> 00:19:31,350
Speaker 1: Cuz I've got five volumes and I know there's more Phoenix than in those five volumes.

306
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:39,652
Speaker 1: hmm, so if they reprint the more of Phoenix in a different like size or shape or Cover.

307
00:19:39,672 --> 00:19:50,355
Speaker 0: that's like a look good on my shelf, but this could be really good because I mean not too long ago We discovered a type of manga that really didn't what we'd known about it But we discovered it as in.

308
00:19:50,395 --> 00:19:51,460
Speaker 0: we got it and read it all.

309
00:19:52,003 --> 00:19:59,190
Speaker 0: Manga that we'd never really known like mature Yakuza The kind of manga we like, you know, we didn't really know existed.

310
00:19:59,651 --> 00:20:02,179
Speaker 0: It's pretty the opposite of the popular manga out now.

311
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:06,362
Speaker 0: Yep, like sanctuary Eagle.

312
00:20:06,888 --> 00:20:07,070
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

313
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:12,937
Speaker 1: Yep, apparently they're gonna put Golgo 13 in this new long and I might buy that.

314
00:20:13,058 --> 00:20:20,080
Speaker 0: because yeah for those of you Don't know Golgo 13 take Lupin and James Bond and put them together and then make it more serious.

315
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:22,790
Speaker 1: Yep, it's very serious and not funny.

316
00:20:22,851 --> 00:20:28,112
Speaker 1: I mean and there's a whole lot of Golgo 13 stuff There's animes and video games and all kinds of video games.

317
00:20:28,253 --> 00:20:28,795
Speaker 0: all suck.

318
00:20:28,996 --> 00:20:29,177
Speaker 0: Yeah.

319
00:20:29,197 --> 00:20:32,192
Speaker 1: Oh my god The manga is the real deal or so I've heard.

320
00:20:32,554 --> 00:20:33,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, we haven't actually read it.

321
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,280
Speaker 1: So when that comes out, I'll definitely be buying it at least the first volume to see if it's good.

322
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:45,420
Speaker 0: But I think this is gonna be a really good thing mostly because a lot of these manga They either never came out in the US or some things like they were released here.

323
00:20:46,184 --> 00:20:48,840
Speaker 0: They're out of print and they're really rare and hard to find.

324
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:52,231
Speaker 0: It took us for freaking ever to get all the sanctuary together.

325
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,098
Speaker 1: Yeah now I finally it's now.

326
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:54,780
Speaker 1: it's easy to find.

327
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:55,615
Speaker 1: I know where it's at.

328
00:20:55,717 --> 00:20:57,636
Speaker 1: But You know, it's not.

329
00:20:58,485 --> 00:21:06,944
Speaker 1: It's thing is back in the days When anime was still new and that was sort of what the popular thing was before Tokyo pop Discovered like little girl.

330
00:21:06,964 --> 00:21:08,128
Speaker 1: shojo was the way to go.

331
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:11,038
Speaker 1: then those are the kinds of mangas they were bringing over.

332
00:21:11,078 --> 00:21:18,760
Speaker 1: you would get your Crying Freeman and your sanctuary and your eagle and all that stuff and they didn't sell that well Just because the market wasn't that big back then.

333
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:19,020
Speaker 0: Yeah.

334
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:30,764
Speaker 1: And then when they switched up the market and Tokyo pop came around a couple years ago and they started doing what they're doing now They didn't really reprint those things and they've been out of print and no one cared about him and forgot about him Except for the people like us.

335
00:21:31,145 --> 00:21:31,346
Speaker 0: Yep.

336
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:35,500
Speaker 0: We kind of discovered them and they were awesome and we could never find him.

337
00:21:35,841 --> 00:21:43,287
Speaker 0: I remember we'd be digging through discount or bargain whatever bins in the middle of conventions looking for like one random episode Or one random issue or something.

338
00:21:43,307 --> 00:21:44,914
Speaker 1: Yeah, like first president of Japan.

339
00:21:44,934 --> 00:21:46,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, something like that.

340
00:21:47,308 --> 00:21:52,429
Speaker 1: all right, so Ghibli Is making a new movie Ghibli.

341
00:21:52,529 --> 00:22:04,418
Speaker 1: now, there's two bits of news about this movie - yeah The first bit of news about this movie is that it's being directed by his son Miyazaki son, huh?

342
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:11,720
Speaker 1: Goro Miyazaki and Miyazaki supposedly is not so happy because he doesn't want his son to be a director.

343
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:13,232
Speaker 0: Why?

344
00:22:14,362 --> 00:22:17,922
Speaker 1: It doesn't say Hmm.

345
00:22:17,942 --> 00:22:19,105
Speaker 0: Oh, well, we'll see how it turns out.

346
00:22:19,406 --> 00:22:22,755
Speaker 1: It just says Miyazaki senior does not want his son to become a director.

347
00:22:22,775 --> 00:22:29,107
Speaker 1: I Don't know what that's about But alright, just just keep that in mind.

348
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,333
Speaker 1: great to the movie.

349
00:22:31,815 --> 00:22:40,116
Speaker 1: a lot of Ghibli movies are based on books and things What was I wasn't how based on some book children's but based on a book called howl's moving castle.

350
00:22:40,437 --> 00:22:45,639
Speaker 1: All right, okay This is actually based on a book that I've heard of and read.

351
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:53,796
Speaker 1: I've actually read all of the series of books except for one which I have and I just didn't read yet the earth sea series By Ursula K Le Guin.

352
00:22:54,703 --> 00:22:56,050
Speaker 0: I've always been meaning to read though.

353
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,175
Speaker 1: It's real easy to read.

354
00:22:57,195 --> 00:22:59,439
Speaker 1: if you haven't read it Just go get all the volumes.

355
00:22:59,621 --> 00:23:07,600
Speaker 1: You could read them all in like double days because they're not written at the highest reading level You know in terms of big words, and it's really fast to read.

356
00:23:07,781 --> 00:23:14,872
Speaker 1: You know a teenager could read it in like a week, you know all of them But it's very deep in its meaning.

357
00:23:14,952 --> 00:23:17,360
Speaker 1: So even someone who's old can get a lot out of it.

358
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:21,615
Speaker 1: I didn't even find it until like, you know, three or two or three years ago.

359
00:23:21,635 --> 00:23:22,859
Speaker 0: In fact, didn't you know?

360
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,767
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bought all of them wild.

361
00:23:25,787 --> 00:23:27,192
Speaker 0: Would you leave one out in the rain?

362
00:23:27,673 --> 00:23:28,215
Speaker 1: No, that was.

363
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:37,322
Speaker 1: that was kidnapped by the guy who wrote Treasure Island, ah It was a pirate book.

364
00:23:37,585 --> 00:23:41,963
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah I just remember that because you you were like we all went inside and there's.

365
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:45,095
Speaker 0: you saw this book laying out and you thought It was my book.

366
00:23:45,115 --> 00:23:47,230
Speaker 0: So you left it outside, you know, haha screw rim.

367
00:23:47,832 --> 00:23:50,284
Speaker 0: And then you went out the next day and it was your book and it rained.

368
00:23:50,465 --> 00:23:51,389
Speaker 1: the rain was the problem.

369
00:23:52,272 --> 00:24:00,745
Speaker 1: Anyway, so the book the name of the movie is called ghetto Senki tales from Earthsea ghetto.

370
00:24:00,909 --> 00:24:02,477
Speaker 1: I Know this because I could figure it out.

371
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:08,562
Speaker 1: the name of the main character in Earthsea is GED GED so calling it ghetto Senki.

372
00:24:08,642 --> 00:24:08,964
Speaker 1: It's like.

373
00:24:09,064 --> 00:24:12,699
Speaker 1: I think it's the story of GED Something like that and I don't know.

374
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:21,036
Speaker 1: Well can ask Emily somebody Japanese tales from Earthsea which is the universe that the World that the book is written in.

375
00:24:21,697 --> 00:24:34,889
Speaker 1: and there's actually a poster for the movie available online that I can see and it shows who GED Obviously staring up and looking at this dragon, right and looking at it I can go.

376
00:24:35,552 --> 00:24:36,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's about.

377
00:24:36,617 --> 00:24:41,820
Speaker 1: you know, having seen many Ghibli movies and read all the books I can look at that and I say yeah, that's pretty accurate.

378
00:24:42,362 --> 00:24:46,667
Speaker 1: You know, that's about what I expected and That means it's probably gonna be really good.

379
00:24:47,574 --> 00:24:59,346
Speaker 1: however, the one thing that bothers me is that GED at least as far as I can see him in this picture is really white and A big part of the story is that he's not really white.

380
00:24:59,426 --> 00:25:00,069
Speaker 1: He's like dark.

381
00:25:00,973 --> 00:25:01,356
Speaker 0: So what's this?

382
00:25:01,417 --> 00:25:01,860
Speaker 0: I hear about?

383
00:25:01,921 --> 00:25:02,930
Speaker 0: a Naruto marathon?

384
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:07,950
Speaker 1: Well, you know how like on New Year's like the TV channels tend to do big marathons of things.

385
00:25:08,411 --> 00:25:11,241
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember watching all bond last year.

386
00:25:11,261 --> 00:25:12,767
Speaker 1: Oh, I like the all bond ones.

387
00:25:12,827 --> 00:25:16,077
Speaker 1: I like the all Twilight zones on sci-fi channel.

388
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:17,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, the outer limits sometimes.

389
00:25:18,146 --> 00:25:21,870
Speaker 1: Well Cartoon Network They used to do like these cartoon cartoon things.

390
00:25:21,970 --> 00:25:25,390
Speaker 1: They would show the cartoon the cartoons that were only on Cartoon Network.

391
00:25:25,791 --> 00:25:30,870
Speaker 1: They would just keep showing those all day for like the whole weekend even sometimes and I liked it.

392
00:25:30,930 --> 00:25:45,669
Speaker 1: I remember the when I first got Cartoon Network, that's what they had on and it was like, ooh, all right but it looks like you can really tell that things are changing in this country because December 31st is gonna be eight and a half hour.

393
00:25:46,175 --> 00:25:52,833
Speaker 1: Naruto marathon gray 17 straight episodes That's cool.

394
00:25:52,873 --> 00:25:56,190
Speaker 1: If you like Naruto, yeah, I'm not the biggest fan of Naruto.

395
00:25:56,190 --> 00:26:02,149
Speaker 1: I think I watched the first 13 episodes and then I realized that The last like eight of them were a single fight.

396
00:26:03,852 --> 00:26:05,781
Speaker 0: The show is much better when they were in ninja school.

397
00:26:05,801 --> 00:26:06,304
Speaker 0: It was just funny.

398
00:26:06,344 --> 00:26:07,510
Speaker 0: ninja school antics.

399
00:26:07,711 --> 00:26:09,659
Speaker 1: I know it's like you watch the first few episodes like.

400
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,523
Speaker 1: this is the greatest show.

401
00:26:10,583 --> 00:26:11,266
Speaker 1: ninja school.

402
00:26:11,326 --> 00:26:13,155
Speaker 1: You read the first manga You're like ninja school.

403
00:26:13,175 --> 00:26:17,296
Speaker 1: Yes, the rest of the thing isn't about ninja school It's just fighting.

404
00:26:17,677 --> 00:26:19,546
Speaker 1: they should just made a ninja school manga.

405
00:26:19,586 --> 00:26:20,430
Speaker 1: It would have been the greatest.

406
00:26:20,591 --> 00:26:21,739
Speaker 1: I would have be still be buying it.

407
00:26:21,759 --> 00:26:25,418
Speaker 1: Oh Well, it's gonna make some people happy.

408
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:26,040
Speaker 0: Yeah.

409
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:31,035
Speaker 1: Yep, and it definitely shows that anime is Seriously on the move.

410
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:42,350
Speaker 1: and the last thing isn't really so important Sunrise, you know the animation studio that does like cowabeebop and all those other good shows, you know usually under bandai.

411
00:26:43,233 --> 00:26:48,030
Speaker 1: They're making a new robot show which means potential new good anime.

412
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:50,119
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll see.

413
00:26:50,139 --> 00:26:57,003
Speaker 1: I'm not saying it is good But it shows more potential than most of the shows that I've seen in the past couple years.

414
00:26:57,363 --> 00:27:02,696
Speaker 1: So it's called zega pain Zega pain zega pain.

415
00:27:03,158 --> 00:27:04,183
Speaker 0: So it's a robot show.

416
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:06,633
Speaker 1: I Think I'm not sure.

417
00:27:06,774 --> 00:27:10,150
Speaker 1: it looks like it might be a one robot show which is the good kind.

418
00:27:10,433 --> 00:27:11,483
Speaker 1: So we're gonna have to find out.

419
00:27:12,894 --> 00:27:15,446
Speaker 0: Could be I mean Gundam seed wasn't a one robot show.

420
00:27:15,688 --> 00:27:16,090
Speaker 1: that's true.

421
00:27:16,752 --> 00:27:18,779
Speaker 1: I'm not saying only the one robot shows are good.

422
00:27:18,819 --> 00:27:21,890
Speaker 1: I'm saying this looks like it has serious potential for good.

423
00:27:22,191 --> 00:27:26,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, also I point out that you hate giant robo, which is the quintessential one robot show.

424
00:27:27,232 --> 00:27:28,155
Speaker 1: I don't like giant robots.

425
00:27:28,175 --> 00:27:29,941
Speaker 0: a giant robo is awesome.

426
00:27:30,423 --> 00:27:32,550
Speaker 0: I like Gigant or in fact, it's in the Netflix queue.

427
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:33,235
Speaker 0: We're gonna watch it.

428
00:27:33,477 --> 00:27:34,645
Speaker 1: No, I'm not gonna watch it.

429
00:27:34,927 --> 00:27:35,290
Speaker 0: I'm fine.

430
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:37,440
Speaker 0: Yeah.

431
00:27:38,994 --> 00:27:44,410
Speaker 0: so, huh, basically We had nothing today, this is probably probably the low point.

432
00:27:44,933 --> 00:27:47,989
Speaker 0: I mean you gotta we got off days every now and then you got to give us that.

433
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:56,741
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least we're not like, you know, not every penny arcade comic is equal But they come out with one even if they come out with it at 4 p.m Now,

434
00:27:57,343 --> 00:28:11,668
Speaker 0: hey, man, no Today's penny arcade mostly because Scott and I have basically had that exact conversation multiple times only with different words and different bits, but the same idea.

435
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:16,930
Speaker 1: Yep It's always scary how comics and things mirror real life.

436
00:28:17,371 --> 00:28:20,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, or maybe real life mirrors comics and things.
