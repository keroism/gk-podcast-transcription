1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,599
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, February 21st, 2012.

2
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:10,940
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:16,688
Speaker 0: You don't need to stop making noise.

4
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:20,059
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:20,441 --> 00:00:22,730
Speaker 1: Tonight, a thousand and one nights.

6
00:00:25,193 --> 00:00:25,903
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:27,712 --> 00:00:29,170
Speaker 1: That was funny.

8
00:00:29,490 --> 00:00:29,638
Speaker 0: Oh, good.

9
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:34,180
Speaker 1: You know what would be really clever?

10
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:36,650
Speaker 1: We'll get Teller from Penn & Teller to be on the show, right?

11
00:00:37,172 --> 00:00:41,088
Speaker 1: But we'll be like, "So Teller, he won't talk because he's not really here, but we'll act like he's

12
00:00:41,128 --> 00:00:41,289
Speaker 1: here.".

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:42,370
Speaker 1: Wouldn't that be hilarious?

14
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:44,110
Speaker 0: I'm just improving my variety skills.

15
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:54,069
Speaker 1: It would be very much like making a rim job joke to me, or a father joke to our friend Luke, or perhaps calling my tool a tool, as I did on Twitter earlier today.

16
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:00,549
Speaker 1: So last Friday was my company, we had a fancy party, as my companies tend to do.

17
00:01:01,252 --> 00:01:02,181
Speaker 1: It was the Christmas party.

18
00:01:02,201 --> 00:01:03,150
Speaker 1: that was just much delayed.

19
00:01:04,391 --> 00:01:11,510
Speaker 1: So we went to the Italian wine merchants and had a sort of wine paired tasting.

20
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,329
Speaker 1: I wasn't really sure what to expect, but check this.

21
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:22,690
Speaker 1: We had a real sommelier, a dedicated sommelier who presented wine and gave us wine and explained every wine along the way, poured it, decanted it, everything.

22
00:01:23,871 --> 00:01:32,229
Speaker 1: And we had a whole bunch of pairings in a row, so they'd bring out a tiny little dish, and two different wines to go with it, and then a third wine to go with it, and then another tiny little dish.

23
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:42,150
Speaker 1: Two little wines, then a third wine, and I gotta tell you, I like wine a lot, and I know a lot about wine relative to a lot of people, because I pay a lot of attention to it.

24
00:01:42,391 --> 00:01:46,210
Speaker 1: I write down what I like, I take notes, I have a list of wines I think are good and think are bad.

25
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:54,930
Speaker 1: I can tell you vague differences between a Chianti and a Merlot, and a white and a red and whatever, but yeah, I don't know shit compared to these people.

26
00:01:56,451 --> 00:01:57,350
Speaker 1: That was some really good wine, though.

27
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:59,830
Speaker 0: Or you don't pretend to know shit as much as they pretend to know shit.

28
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:09,910
Speaker 1: No, because, see you say that, Scott, but double-blind tests time and time again show that people who study it can actually tell very specifically two different wines apart from each other.

29
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,409
Speaker 0: So why don't they just only have the best ones and get rid of all the crappy ones?

30
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:16,670
Speaker 1: Because the best ones cost more money.

31
00:02:17,532 --> 00:02:21,370
Speaker 0: If you made more of it, the supply would be greater and the cost would be cheaper.

32
00:02:21,851 --> 00:02:23,009
Speaker 1: You can't always make more of it.

33
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:27,630
Speaker 1: Sometimes a wine is only good because of some particular condition of that vintage or that year.

34
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,850
Speaker 0: See, the thing that bothers me is they put so much effort into this one fruit and this one beverage for this one fruit.

35
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,657
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, the world is full of fruits.

36
00:02:35,058 --> 00:02:37,870
Speaker 0: They don't put nearly as much effort into, say, mango wine.

37
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:47,030
Speaker 1: So why don't you start a vineyard, or I guess an orchard, and have the best fucking apples and spend that effort on apples and the terroir and find the perfect place.

38
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,759
Speaker 0: Because I don't know shit about Corona.

39
00:02:50,025 --> 00:02:50,950
Speaker 0: That's not my terroir.

40
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:52,490
Speaker 1: I mean, you could elevate apple juice.

41
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,469
Speaker 0: If you want me to make computer wine, I can do that.

42
00:02:54,731 --> 00:02:57,849
Speaker 1: You could elevate apple juice to the same place wine is now if you worked at it.

43
00:02:59,031 --> 00:03:06,570
Speaker 1: I think what's going against you, Scott, is that wine has many thousands of years of tradition since it's one of the few things people could drink back in the days of disease.

44
00:03:07,311 --> 00:03:15,349
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's just because there were people in Europe who were growing and making wines before people in the apple-growing places were doing so.

45
00:03:16,132 --> 00:03:18,110
Speaker 1: So why didn't Johnny Appleseed get on that shit?

46
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:20,184
Speaker 0: He wasn't a real person.

47
00:03:20,325 --> 00:03:20,929
Speaker 0: Was he a real person?

48
00:03:21,413 --> 00:03:21,988
Speaker 1: You don't know, do you?

49
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:23,010
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure he wasn't.

50
00:03:23,751 --> 00:03:26,849
Speaker 1: So anyway, it's Tuesday, video game day, board game day.

51
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,969
Speaker 0: He was hanging with Paul Bunyan.

52
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:28,948
Speaker 1: So what did he got for me?

53
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:31,189
Speaker 0: Apparently Johnny Appleseed was a real person.

54
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:33,870
Speaker 1: I was also on my way to Wikipedia.

55
00:03:34,733 --> 00:03:37,669
Speaker 1: I knew he was, but I didn't know much about him.

56
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,268
Speaker 1: Other than that, the story I saw in the Disney cartoon is probably not 100% accurate.

57
00:03:43,172 --> 00:03:43,546
Speaker 0: No, you think?

58
00:03:44,932 --> 00:03:45,186
Speaker 0: Okay.

59
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:46,187
Speaker 1: So what do you got?

60
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:46,618
Speaker 0: A news?

61
00:03:46,990 --> 00:03:47,076
Speaker 0: News.

62
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:48,234
Speaker 0: Alright, so check this out.

63
00:03:48,255 --> 00:03:50,408
Speaker 0: Someone wrote this article and was like, "Why the NFL bans

64
00:03:50,508 --> 00:03:50,790
Speaker 0: iPads.".

65
00:03:50,810 --> 00:04:01,189
Speaker 0: Now people don't know this, but in footballs, the American footballs, in the olden days, what they would do is they would have someone at the top of the stadium who would take a picture of the play.

66
00:04:02,271 --> 00:04:09,867
Speaker 0: Then he would tie the photograph to a little balloon or a rope and rope it down to the sidelines so the coach could look at it.

67
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:13,710
Speaker 0: Nowadays, it's really not much more sophisticated than that.

68
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:22,290
Speaker 0: They have someone at the top of the stadium take a big black and white photo of the whole thing and then it gets printed out of a laser printer down on the sideline and they have binders.

69
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:28,170
Speaker 0: You'll see them during the games with these big binders full of black and white photos showing team offense, team defense, whatever.

70
00:04:30,032 --> 00:04:32,469
Speaker 0: There's been talk of like, "Well, look, why don't they just have a freaking

71
00:04:32,549 --> 00:04:32,650
Speaker 0: iPad?".

72
00:04:34,092 --> 00:04:37,970
Speaker 0: Or just something with a screen and they can just poke it and it would be great.

73
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,350
Speaker 1: Now this problem isn't just endemic to football.

74
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:43,690
Speaker 1: Look at football, where they won't even use proper officiation.

75
00:04:44,412 --> 00:04:45,357
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

76
00:04:45,498 --> 00:04:47,388
Speaker 0: How come coaches can't use this?

77
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:51,350
Speaker 0: How come only the quarterback has headphones in his helmet and they have to huddle up?

78
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:53,390
Speaker 0: Why don't they just put the headphones in everyone's helmet?

79
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:59,930
Speaker 1: Hell, why don't we have augmented reality goggles in everyone's helmet so they can see all the stats of everyone, the plays are coming in in real time?

80
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:06,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, so they were researching doing this and I was just like, "Yeah, the only reason they don't do that is because they're just slow on the uptake and

81
00:05:06,268 --> 00:05:06,530
Speaker 0: whatever.".

82
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:31,930
Speaker 0: No, this guy thought of something that I should have thought of, which is there's a very really good reason they don't do it, which is that you'll basically, it's not cheating but you'll cheat because what you'll do is somebody will develop an AI coaching program that looks at the plays and shows the real coach like, "There is a 99% probability this is the play they will run in the next play.

83
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,668
Speaker 0: Here is the optimal play to run against

84
00:05:33,688 --> 00:05:33,769
Speaker 0: them.".

85
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,789
Speaker 0: And the actual coach won't really have to do all that much.

86
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:38,669
Speaker 0: So Scott, the computer will now run the whole show.

87
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:46,106
Speaker 1: You realize this is the same thing as saying, "Here's why in El Grande you're not allowed to see what's in the Castille because it makes the players remember to make the

88
00:05:46,147 --> 00:05:46,248
Speaker 1: game.".

89
00:05:46,671 --> 00:05:56,328
Speaker 1: It's basically saying, "This sport is fundamentally flawed and we are going to make one aspect of it difficult to analyze to slow down the inevitable computerization of

90
00:05:56,348 --> 00:05:56,550
Speaker 1: everything.".

91
00:05:56,651 --> 00:06:02,230
Speaker 0: Right, so the thing is if you did computerize it, it would come down to simply execution by the players on the field.

92
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,689
Speaker 1: You mean like baseball is now?

93
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:04,870
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly.

94
00:06:06,255 --> 00:06:11,930
Speaker 1: The thing is, even with the current technology, they could do it eventually anyway even without that technology.

95
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:12,908
Speaker 0: How could they do it?

96
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:24,110
Speaker 1: So all you have to do is get the picture of every play before it goes and then the result of that play and have someone keying in all this data after games and building up a giant statistical database.

97
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:28,329
Speaker 0: Oh, they already have this database, but the point is you don't have access to the database during the game.

98
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:31,846
Speaker 1: So it would probably be...

99
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:33,310
Speaker 0: They have this already.

100
00:06:33,570 --> 00:06:35,370
Speaker 1: No, so what I'm saying, Scott, let me finish.

101
00:06:35,872 --> 00:06:50,446
Speaker 1: It would probably be, if someone was actually willing to cheat, pretty easy to have someone else in the stands or with a plane or in space with a satellite watching this stuff and feeding a play stream to the coach.

102
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:52,270
Speaker 0: How are you going to feed it to the coach?

103
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:54,249
Speaker 1: All right, so does he have that headset on?

104
00:06:55,132 --> 00:06:56,269
Speaker 0: He does, but it's encrypted.

105
00:06:56,751 --> 00:06:59,610
Speaker 0: And remember, they check it before the NFL comes in.

106
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,741
Speaker 0: You're only allowed to have the headset.

107
00:07:00,762 --> 00:07:05,090
Speaker 0: with certain people and most of those, it's like a closed-circuit thing.

108
00:07:05,151 --> 00:07:06,705
Speaker 0: You can't just communicate with the coach.

109
00:07:07,490 --> 00:07:10,470
Speaker 1: Is it against the rules for the coach to look at the audience?

110
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,210
Speaker 0: You're going to get hand signals from the stands?

111
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,140
Speaker 0: Can he look into the stands?

112
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:14,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I got hand signals.

113
00:07:15,513 --> 00:07:17,550
Speaker 1: Is it against the rules for him to look into the stands?

114
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:20,470
Speaker 0: It's not, but here's the problem with hand signals from the stands.

115
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:24,129
Speaker 0: The other coach can read the hand signals from the stands once they figure it out.

116
00:07:25,051 --> 00:07:30,109
Speaker 1: Ah, so this coach only knows in each quarter, here's the seat you look at.

117
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:33,750
Speaker 0: Also, who is exactly in the stands giving these hand signals?

118
00:07:33,972 --> 00:07:35,590
Speaker 1: Oh, you buy tickets ahead of time.

119
00:07:36,236 --> 00:07:36,829
Speaker 0: Who's the person?

120
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:38,190
Speaker 1: I don't know, you hire someone.

121
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,029
Speaker 0: So you hire someone, so now it's a staff of your team?

122
00:07:41,696 --> 00:07:41,889
Speaker 0: Sure.

123
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:42,729
Speaker 0: Nope, not allowed.

124
00:07:43,434 --> 00:07:44,530
Speaker 1: So what exactly is the rule?

125
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:55,950
Speaker 0: I don't know the specific rule, but people who are on the team, coaches, trainers, they're not allowed to use computers or anything two hours before the game, period.

126
00:07:57,192 --> 00:08:07,490
Speaker 0: You're not allowed to have cell phones, you're not allowed to communicate with anyone except on those phones, those hard-wired phones on the sideline, and those talk to the booth up at the top where your other coaches are.

127
00:08:07,771 --> 00:08:17,470
Speaker 0: You cannot talk to pretty much anyone during the game, so it'd pretty much have to be hand signals from the stands from someone who is a fan and could not be connected to your team in any way.

128
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:20,150
Speaker 1: So there's precedent for that, it's called Super PACs.

129
00:08:20,971 --> 00:08:27,725
Speaker 1: Someone founds another corporation, completely separate, that makes its money based on, I don't know, betting on the spread of the team.

130
00:08:27,765 --> 00:08:28,190
Speaker 1: it's helping.

131
00:08:28,592 --> 00:08:36,188
Speaker 0: The other problem is, if the person who is giving these hand signals has to be in a position to see what's going on.

132
00:08:36,431 --> 00:08:39,470
Speaker 1: Oh, so they have a computer and they have access to all this data.

133
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,270
Speaker 0: No, here's the problem.

134
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:43,950
Speaker 0: In order to be able to see what's going on, you have to be in the nosebleeds to see everything.

135
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you've got one guy in the nosebleed seeing everything.

136
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:48,261
Speaker 0: And by the time he communicates, it's too late.

137
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,990
Speaker 1: He's talking in real time with the guy doing the hand signals down the line.

138
00:08:53,010 --> 00:08:55,070
Speaker 0: And what do you do when the other team runs the hurry-up offense?

139
00:08:56,312 --> 00:08:57,590
Speaker 1: In that case, you've got to just wing it.

140
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,189
Speaker 0: You don't have enough time.

141
00:08:58,390 --> 00:08:58,985
Speaker 1: You've got to just wing it.

142
00:08:59,530 --> 00:08:59,619
Speaker 1: Yeah.

143
00:09:00,253 --> 00:09:01,030
Speaker 1: Here's the real issue.

144
00:09:01,932 --> 00:09:10,929
Speaker 1: Even if there's no way around it, because they make rules, maybe they set up a screen where the football players themselves can't see the people in the stands.

145
00:09:11,690 --> 00:09:14,369
Speaker 1: Like some sort of plasma screen that you can only see one way through the air.

146
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:14,923
Speaker 1: I don't know.

147
00:09:16,351 --> 00:09:24,070
Speaker 1: It's the same as the rules in bullshit games like Shadows over Camelot, where you're not allowed to talk because the game's broken.

148
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,890
Speaker 0: Well, it's different than talking.

149
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,507
Speaker 0: It's accessing a database of information live.

150
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,330
Speaker 0: That's like looking in the Scrabble dictionary during Scrabble.

151
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:35,550
Speaker 0: But what you're saying is that this game-- Oh, you can't look in the Scrabble dictionary during Scrabble.

152
00:09:35,630 --> 00:09:36,243
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, duh.

153
00:09:37,332 --> 00:09:38,050
Speaker 1: Ah, but this is different.

154
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:40,169
Speaker 0: This is more-- It's exactly the same as that.

155
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:46,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time, Scrabble is flawed in that someone who has memorized that can play fairly optimally.

156
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:48,090
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's true.

157
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:54,910
Speaker 0: But a lot of people, they just memorize the two-letter words and the cue words, and they don't memorize all the words.

158
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,109
Speaker 0: All right, so what if I just have a robot coach-- This is the equivalent of memorizing all the words.

159
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:02,110
Speaker 1: What if we make a robot coach straight up?

160
00:10:02,632 --> 00:10:03,408
Speaker 0: That's what this would be.

161
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, what if we make that-- You're not allowed to have a robot coach.

162
00:10:06,810 --> 00:10:07,669
Speaker 0: You have to have a person coach.

163
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:13,890
Speaker 1: So what about in the future when we make AIs in bodies that are deemed human by the UN?

164
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:19,650
Speaker 0: Then football probably won't be a sport by then because it'll probably be played by the robot--.

165
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,587
Speaker 1: Then it would be an awesome sport because it would be like F1.

166
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:24,749
Speaker 1: This year, everyone's only allowed to have one leg.

167
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,970
Speaker 0: It's a speed restrictor.

168
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,130
Speaker 0: Football wouldn't exist anymore.

169
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,790
Speaker 0: It would be other sports that robots play.

170
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,970
Speaker 1: I think it would be evolved football.

171
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:35,530
Speaker 1: I think humans will hold on to football even after they no longer have human bodies.

172
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:40,530
Speaker 0: Even football people are suggesting that football is actually not going to be around forever.

173
00:10:41,090 --> 00:10:43,110
Speaker 0: Scott, they say that-- The number one sport used to be boxing.

174
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:44,129
Speaker 0: Where's boxing now?

175
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:48,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Scott, look at baseball, tenuously holding on despite the fact that no one cares.

176
00:10:49,378 --> 00:10:49,790
Speaker 0: People care.

177
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,581
Speaker 1: But baseball is that end game of.

178
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:58,370
Speaker 1: basically it comes down to just the menial execution of one guy and the microsecond of when he actually swung.

179
00:10:58,890 --> 00:11:01,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, they should make it harder to play baseball.

180
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,170
Speaker 0: They should make the pitchers mound farther back.

181
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:04,530
Speaker 0: They should make the bases farther out.

182
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:09,590
Speaker 0: They should bring the fences farther out so it's harder to hit and it's harder to pitch and everything's harder.

183
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:18,648
Speaker 1: The other thing is that more and more what you can do is analyze games after the fact and come up with expert systems that can be referenced via binders and people--.

184
00:11:19,372 --> 00:11:23,330
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to make an expert system via the binder instead of the database?

185
00:11:24,231 --> 00:11:33,750
Speaker 1: Yeah, basically if you can boil it down to-- There are some decisions-- This is impossible to do if you try to make all the decisions for the coach.

186
00:11:34,390 --> 00:11:35,610
Speaker 0: It's not illegal to have the binder.

187
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:40,230
Speaker 0: If you could make that binder that took the place of the database, you would have mad money.

188
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:44,650
Speaker 1: This is what I'm saying because here's one thing about game theory that's fascinating.

189
00:11:45,112 --> 00:11:50,470
Speaker 1: Game theory-- The computations on complex games are more than a human could do.

190
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:55,890
Speaker 1: They're mostly more than a computer can do because a computer-- One, a human just can't do all the calculations.

191
00:11:56,552 --> 00:11:58,490
Speaker 0: We're not talking about calculating the game theory.

192
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:00,790
Speaker 0: We're talking about statistical models.

193
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,648
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're the same thing, so hear me out.

194
00:12:04,291 --> 00:12:17,210
Speaker 1: In computers and algorithms that will solve a game, they basically can only do it by brute force because what a computer cannot do that humans can by hook or crook do very magically well is look at a list of options.

195
00:12:17,631 --> 00:12:21,770
Speaker 1: Like in Puerto Rico, I have a ludicrous number of options every turn, and you know what?

196
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:22,496
Speaker 0: Well, not really.

197
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:23,710
Speaker 0: You have six at most.

198
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,009
Speaker 1: Relative to the number of options that reasonably can be good for me.

199
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:29,976
Speaker 1: Look at chess.

200
00:12:30,358 --> 00:12:32,850
Speaker 1: There are so many options every turn.

201
00:12:32,950 --> 00:12:35,670
Speaker 1: It's ridiculous, and it's only compounded turn after turn.

202
00:12:36,091 --> 00:12:41,470
Speaker 1: Every turn, the majority of those options to any human will be obviously crap.

203
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:51,710
Speaker 1: So what you do is you leave the decisions that humans are good at in the hands of the coach, and you boil down a set of binders for each difficult decision.

204
00:12:52,952 --> 00:13:00,129
Speaker 1: So if there's a difficult decision, that's when the coach does the timeout, gets the printout, looks in the expert system, finds the answer, and executes it.

205
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:03,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, but how many games though, right?

206
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:05,930
Speaker 0: See this thing, it ruins the sport as a spectator sport.

207
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,033
Speaker 1: Fuck that.

208
00:13:07,254 --> 00:13:13,550
Speaker 1: So games that are spectator sports have to change the rules to make the game always interesting to the spectator.

209
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,239
Speaker 1: This is baseball's primary problem.

210
00:13:15,561 --> 00:13:20,590
Speaker 1: Great to play, boring to watch, because there's nothing left for the spectator unless you're, I don't know, bored?

211
00:13:20,610 --> 00:13:21,902
Speaker 0: A lot of people like to watch it.

212
00:13:21,962 --> 00:13:22,790
Speaker 0: They fill stadiums.

213
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:28,089
Speaker 1: I know, but not nearly as many people as they used to, and I see a lot of empty seats when I see baseball games.

214
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:31,009
Speaker 0: No, that's because you see baseball games at like the Mets stadium.

215
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:31,848
Speaker 0: Ah, the Mets.

216
00:13:33,273 --> 00:13:36,630
Speaker 0: Go to the Red Sox, go to Fenway, it's packed, it's sold out every game.

217
00:13:36,870 --> 00:13:38,470
Speaker 1: Compare the popularity of baseball to football.

218
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:40,789
Speaker 0: Well, there's many different reasons for that.

219
00:13:40,873 --> 00:13:41,170
Speaker 0: I know, I know.

220
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:43,890
Speaker 0: Because there's not a lot of football games, so each one is crazy important.

221
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,549
Speaker 0: Believe me, if there were only 16 baseball games, each one would be sold out.

222
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:53,290
Speaker 1: But if I'm in a game, and I'm playing that game to win, fuck the spectators.

223
00:13:53,350 --> 00:14:03,030
Speaker 1: Remember, I mean, we were in that Mario Party, the Duck Hunt and Super Mario Brothers, no, regular Mario Brothers tournament at OhioCon in 2002.

224
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,050
Speaker 1: The spectators, you know, wanted to see the match.

225
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,329
Speaker 1: I stood up because I had to see the screen better than you.

226
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,750
Speaker 1: They wanted to see a long, drawn-out point match.

227
00:14:10,234 --> 00:14:13,530
Speaker 1: I just pushed you into a fucking fireball, because you know what, I'm playing to win the goddamn game.

228
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:14,124
Speaker 0: Well, yeah.

229
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:24,970
Speaker 1: I mean, so if the players can do something optimal, like, you know, the Giants played a very somewhat boring to watch, but the most chance of winning strategy at the end of the Super Bowl.

230
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,048
Speaker 1: I would have been mad if they did anything but that.

231
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:29,150
Speaker 0: Well, they're not stupid, right?

232
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:29,787
Speaker 1: Exactly.

233
00:14:30,410 --> 00:14:30,989
Speaker 0: The Super Bowl, you're not.

234
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:37,830
Speaker 0: You know, if you wanted to make the game entertaining, right, you would lose, because it's way more exciting when it's like, you'd be burning wheel if you wanted to make entertaining.

235
00:14:38,430 --> 00:14:39,430
Speaker 0: You'd be like, I'm just going to fumble.

236
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:40,569
Speaker 1: Ooh, it's exciting.

237
00:14:41,511 --> 00:14:43,008
Speaker 0: I got to drop the ball, what the fuck?

238
00:14:44,255 --> 00:14:44,490
Speaker 0: Right?

239
00:14:44,772 --> 00:14:46,190
Speaker 0: That would be the most exciting game.

240
00:14:46,371 --> 00:14:49,170
Speaker 1: Maybe like variety shows, Running Man, we need variety sports.

241
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:49,915
Speaker 1: You know what it is?

242
00:14:49,935 --> 00:14:51,210
Speaker 1: It's called the Harlem Globetrotters.

243
00:14:51,535 --> 00:14:52,269
Speaker 0: Yeah, they were just here.

244
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:53,109
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

245
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:53,870
Speaker 0: Anyway.

246
00:14:54,310 --> 00:15:00,230
Speaker 1: So, briefly, there's an article on Slashdot mostly talking about software, and they weren't really aiming this at games.

247
00:15:00,531 --> 00:15:00,915
Speaker 0: Software?

248
00:15:00,976 --> 00:15:02,230
Speaker 0: Whoa, what a great topic.

249
00:15:02,931 --> 00:15:05,689
Speaker 1: So, a question was posed, and it was more of a rant.

250
00:15:06,811 --> 00:15:15,990
Speaker 1: A guy asked if splash screens are just a sign of program bloat, and it talks all about splash screens, and you're all familiar with splash screens.

251
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:23,350
Speaker 0: I mean, splash screens are partially because, hey, you click on the program, it doesn't load immediately, so you got to do something so the user knows it is loading.

252
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:28,909
Speaker 0: But, two, a lot of people just do it for like, they want to just get in your brain, so they put that there.

253
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:34,090
Speaker 1: So, this is where it comes to gaming, because I am so sick of games.

254
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,844
Speaker 0: That have all those logos and videos.

255
00:15:35,885 --> 00:15:36,409
Speaker 0: you turn them on?

256
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:39,230
Speaker 1: Yes, I don't care that Sierra made the game.

257
00:15:39,451 --> 00:15:40,590
Speaker 1: I already know that.

258
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:47,110
Speaker 0: You can put the logo somewhere like on the main menu screen, like in the corner, or all, you know, just don't make me wait through it.

259
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:50,750
Speaker 1: So, yeah, there's two kinds of splash screens, and we'll just talk about games, forget software.

260
00:15:50,870 --> 00:16:00,588
Speaker 1: I have a whole technical argument as to why the way splash screens are done are mostly bullshit, but there's splash screens like when I launch, I don't know, Counter Strike, where it takes, or any Valve game.

261
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:09,250
Speaker 1: But it takes a second, you know, I can skip it, but then it just goes to a loading screen saying, yeah, game's still not loaded, you didn't buy anything.

262
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:18,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, see, the Microsoft Office splash screen, it's loading while you're watching that little wavy thing, but the friggin' Counter Strike, that Valve video, it's not loading Counter Strike while you're watching the Valve video, right?

263
00:16:19,050 --> 00:16:20,450
Speaker 0: It's just loading the Valve video.

264
00:16:20,770 --> 00:16:29,848
Speaker 1: Ah, but I think that's bullshit anyway, because splash screens existed to give you instant feedback when you clicked on something, because we know that if you don't get instant feedback on a computer, people freak out.

265
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:36,810
Speaker 1: But splash screens are so ubiquitous that when people see a splash screen, they assume nothing's happening anyway.

266
00:16:37,612 --> 00:16:40,510
Speaker 1: A splash screen, I think, does nothing for you in the modern era.

267
00:16:41,577 --> 00:16:42,188
Speaker 1: And I hate them.

268
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:43,369
Speaker 0: I also hate them.

269
00:16:43,490 --> 00:16:46,990
Speaker 1: I'm sick of the fact that interfaces don't respond to me immediately.

270
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:48,950
Speaker 1: Human-computer interaction.

271
00:16:49,932 --> 00:16:54,030
Speaker 1: The interface should have the highest thread priority of fucking anything if there are humans involved.

272
00:16:54,030 --> 00:16:55,870
Speaker 0: Of course, but the thing is, I want to point something out, right?

273
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,950
Speaker 0: This guy, because I read this article too, independently.

274
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,141
Speaker 0: Oh, his rant, whatever.

275
00:16:59,161 --> 00:17:00,150
Speaker 1: I just used this as an excuse.

276
00:17:00,492 --> 00:17:04,789
Speaker 0: He said, why can't it be like the iPhone and the iPad, where everything's instant, right?

277
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,659
Speaker 0: Let's see, here's my iPhone.

278
00:17:06,699 --> 00:17:08,369
Speaker 0: Let me open up the Facebook app.

279
00:17:08,890 --> 00:17:09,538
Speaker 0: Wait, what's that?

280
00:17:09,579 --> 00:17:10,490
Speaker 0: A splash screen?

281
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:11,880
Speaker 0: Wait, what's this on the Google+ app?

282
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:13,069
Speaker 0: Another splash screen?

283
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:16,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything on the iPhone has splash screens also.

284
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:17,161
Speaker 1: Well, droids, better.

285
00:17:17,181 --> 00:17:17,930
Speaker 1: I'll play Carcassonne.

286
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:19,101
Speaker 1: Let's see, I launch it up.

287
00:17:19,343 --> 00:17:19,929
Speaker 1: Nothing.

288
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,118
Speaker 1: Blank, blank, blah.

289
00:17:21,159 --> 00:17:22,150
Speaker 1: There's the splash screen.

290
00:17:22,910 --> 00:17:23,589
Speaker 0: Now there's a loading bar.

291
00:17:23,589 --> 00:17:24,950
Speaker 0: This guy's like, why can't it be like the mobile?

292
00:17:25,172 --> 00:17:27,290
Speaker 0: Oh, but the mobile also has the splash screens.

293
00:17:28,112 --> 00:17:29,229
Speaker 1: Everything has this problem.

294
00:17:29,370 --> 00:17:37,770
Speaker 0: The only time it doesn't have the splash screens in the iPhone is if I load Facebook, it's already loaded, then you won't see the splash screen again.

295
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:40,590
Speaker 0: But if it's completely unloaded, you're going to see the splash screen again.

296
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:42,690
Speaker 1: So guys, I'm going to take you back to an era.

297
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:45,930
Speaker 1: Remember Shockwave.com and Newgrounds and all that shit?

298
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:48,110
Speaker 0: Well, Newgrounds is still around.

299
00:17:50,356 --> 00:17:56,509
Speaker 1: I know, because I made the mistake of asking my Twitter feed what the hell Homestuck was, and good God, did you people respond to me.

300
00:17:57,331 --> 00:18:06,049
Speaker 1: Anyway, but back in the day, I took a bunch of classes on Flash, and I had a copy of Director 7 that I used to make stuff.

301
00:18:07,630 --> 00:18:14,549
Speaker 1: And there's a way, back then even, when you're making a Flash animation, it's going to take a long time to load, because the internet sucked back then.

302
00:18:15,434 --> 00:18:21,730
Speaker 1: You could make a free application that would load quickly and have interaction with the user ahead of the main thing loading the background.

303
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,132
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember that.

304
00:18:22,153 --> 00:18:24,950
Speaker 0: It was like you would have a big Flash file, right?

305
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:26,450
Speaker 0: And a Flash game.

306
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:30,050
Speaker 0: And in those days, in 56K, the Flash game would take a while to load.

307
00:18:30,470 --> 00:18:32,664
Speaker 0: Hell, Radiskull would take like a minute before that,

308
00:18:32,724 --> 00:18:33,187
Speaker 0: "Yeah!"

309
00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:37,230
Speaker 0: Right, so what you would do is there would be a really crappy Space Invaders.

310
00:18:37,431 --> 00:18:39,906
Speaker 0: you would play that loaded in two seconds on a 56K modem.

311
00:18:40,632 --> 00:18:40,986
Speaker 0: So Valve.

312
00:18:41,231 --> 00:18:45,050
Speaker 0: And you would play that Space Invaders while you were waiting for Radiskull.

313
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:54,370
Speaker 1: When I double-click on Counter-Strike, and it's loading, why don't you just pop up the server browser fucking immediately?

314
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:58,130
Speaker 0: Well, you can just do the server browser from Steam, instead of doing it from--.

315
00:18:58,871 --> 00:19:06,430
Speaker 1: Ah, but when I do that, it's not like it's loading Counter-Strike in the background, so I go to join a server, and then it goes "at, at, at," and then it starts loading.

316
00:19:07,153 --> 00:19:08,870
Speaker 1: And Counter-Strike takes like two seconds to load.

317
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:12,670
Speaker 1: What about, you know, Team Fortress 2 takes four or five seconds to load.

318
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:13,617
Speaker 1: That's a lot of time.

319
00:19:13,657 --> 00:19:15,130
Speaker 1: I'm sitting looking at a screen I hate.

320
00:19:15,831 --> 00:19:17,844
Speaker 0: There's a lot of things you have to load into memory.

321
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:18,690
Speaker 0: There's a lot of game resources.

322
00:19:19,110 --> 00:19:21,870
Speaker 1: I know, but I feel like we solved this problem a long time ago.

323
00:19:21,870 --> 00:19:22,636
Speaker 0: How did we solve this problem?

324
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:24,390
Speaker 0: The game has a lot of resource files.

325
00:19:24,551 --> 00:19:26,930
Speaker 0: All these models and 3D maps and everything, right?

326
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:28,290
Speaker 0: So you do what Google does with Chrome.

327
00:19:28,290 --> 00:19:30,110
Speaker 0: And it has to load them off the hard drive and into the RAM.

328
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:33,330
Speaker 1: So Scott, you do what Google does with Chrome, where it prefetches stuff.

329
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:41,989
Speaker 1: If I click on Counter-Strike in Steam, the default should be pop up the server browser and start loading the fucking game into RAM, because I'm probably going to play it.

330
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:43,743
Speaker 1: And if I don't play it, just drop it.

331
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:44,247
Speaker 1: It's a cache.

332
00:19:44,267 --> 00:19:44,650
Speaker 1: Who cares?

333
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:46,229
Speaker 1: People have shit tons of RAM.

334
00:19:46,672 --> 00:19:47,168
Speaker 0: It depends.

335
00:19:49,394 --> 00:19:52,669
Speaker 0: What if you start going clicking around in every game in your Steam, like you're just clicking around.

336
00:19:53,011 --> 00:19:54,830
Speaker 0: Suddenly your computer's doing all this useless work.

337
00:19:55,512 --> 00:19:57,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you're not doing anything else, and you've got plenty of RAM.

338
00:19:58,292 --> 00:20:02,590
Speaker 1: The hit to performance of dropping something out of your cache is negligible for most people.

339
00:20:03,391 --> 00:20:06,490
Speaker 0: It's not the easiest thing to do, especially when every game is different.

340
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:08,370
Speaker 0: So you can't just make one system that works for everything.

341
00:20:08,570 --> 00:20:09,840
Speaker 0: Oh yeah, I'm just saying just Valve do it.

342
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,210
Speaker 1: I don't trust anyone else to do that.

343
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:12,866
Speaker 1: I expect they'll be crazy stupid.

344
00:20:13,532 --> 00:20:17,370
Speaker 0: And because the load times aren't exactly hurting their sales, right?

345
00:20:17,491 --> 00:20:18,790
Speaker 0: Are they going to sell any more Counter-Strikes?

346
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:23,870
Speaker 1: So yes, thus the kind of end game, the reason I brought this up.

347
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,349
Speaker 0: Because that's what you always say.

348
00:20:25,551 --> 00:20:27,570
Speaker 1: As you know, I changed jobs a while ago.

349
00:20:27,590 --> 00:20:30,510
Speaker 1: I'm product manager now, so I design products.

350
00:20:30,890 --> 00:20:34,150
Speaker 1: I have the whole workflow, QA, developer, all that stuff.

351
00:20:34,935 --> 00:20:42,449
Speaker 1: And one thing that I know very clearly is that many of the things that make software good make zero more dollars.

352
00:20:43,432 --> 00:20:46,030
Speaker 1: And it pisses me off, but that's the reality of the world.

353
00:20:46,510 --> 00:20:48,370
Speaker 1: Nobody's going to look at Mass Effect.

354
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:50,630
Speaker 1: That has some shit menus and a bunch of problems.

355
00:20:50,810 --> 00:20:54,230
Speaker 1: Great game, but it has all these little UI problems and things.

356
00:20:54,310 --> 00:20:59,783
Speaker 0: Isn't that that game that Scott Johnson was playing where you had different planets, and sometimes you're in the ship and sometimes you're walking around?

357
00:20:59,803 --> 00:21:00,470
Speaker 0: That game sucks.

358
00:21:00,911 --> 00:21:01,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott hates every game.

359
00:21:01,906 --> 00:21:02,170
Speaker 1: Anyway.

360
00:21:03,811 --> 00:21:14,610
Speaker 1: But all these little UI problems... I mean, look at how many people buy games that don't even support joypads despite the fact that they're a joypad game and they'll go download shady-ass shit like Joy to Pad.

361
00:21:15,011 --> 00:21:15,770
Speaker 0: That doesn't hurt sales at all.

362
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:18,130
Speaker 1: Whatever it is, it's shady.

363
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,890
Speaker 1: Seriously, people, that's why you have spyware.

364
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:25,670
Speaker 0: Well, the reason it doesn't hurt sales is because 90% of people playing a PC game don't have a Joy in the first place.

365
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:26,589
Speaker 0: They don't need Joy to Key.

366
00:21:28,051 --> 00:21:30,430
Speaker 0: It's just rare that people can't even get their microphones to work.

367
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,509
Speaker 0: How are they going to get their Joy to work?

368
00:21:31,691 --> 00:21:34,730
Speaker 1: But look at how many indie games have crap netcode and people buy them anyway.

369
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,430
Speaker 1: Because people don't really care about polish.

370
00:21:37,730 --> 00:21:40,050
Speaker 1: They say they do, and they say they want polish.

371
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,850
Speaker 1: But the only place polish sells is Apple.

372
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:46,290
Speaker 1: And I don't see anyone else trying to do that.

373
00:21:49,034 --> 00:21:50,321
Speaker 1: Maybe they're trying and they're just failing.

374
00:21:50,362 --> 00:21:50,845
Speaker 1: I can't tell.

375
00:21:50,865 --> 00:21:51,710
Speaker 1: Anyway.

376
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,850
Speaker 0: Polish is the most expensive part.

377
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:54,392
Speaker 1: I know.

378
00:21:54,412 --> 00:21:56,970
Speaker 1: I want polish, but there's no money in polish.

379
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:05,410
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

380
00:22:05,654 --> 00:22:06,649
Speaker 0: Alright, we're going to have a game.

381
00:22:07,693 --> 00:22:08,149
Speaker 1: Playing a game?

382
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:11,410
Speaker 0: Yep, the game is called Find the Best Book on Project Gutenberg.

383
00:22:13,272 --> 00:22:14,160
Speaker 1: The Count of Monte Cristo?

384
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,290
Speaker 1: No, it would be a shit translation.

385
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:17,125
Speaker 0: Alright, here's my entry.

386
00:22:17,165 --> 00:22:17,570
Speaker 0: Are you ready?

387
00:22:17,834 --> 00:22:18,150
Speaker 1: I'm ready.

388
00:22:18,390 --> 00:22:25,850
Speaker 0: This is the one to beat, so if Rim or any listener or anyone out there can find a better book on Project Gutenberg than this, then you win.

389
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:29,010
Speaker 0: But, until now, I'm the winner, because here's my submission.

390
00:22:29,110 --> 00:22:29,608
Speaker 0: You ready for this?

391
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,070
Speaker 1: I'm ready.

392
00:22:31,692 --> 00:22:34,089
Speaker 0: This is a book by a man named Francis Grose.

393
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:38,410
Speaker 0: It is a book from 1811, so it's clearly in the public domain.

394
00:22:39,230 --> 00:22:43,209
Speaker 0: It is known as Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue.

395
00:22:44,033 --> 00:22:44,466
Speaker 1: Oh, my.

396
00:22:45,394 --> 00:22:45,804
Speaker 0: Oh, yes.

397
00:22:46,553 --> 00:22:47,108
Speaker 1: Oh, no.

398
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,110
Speaker 0: Shall we examine some entries?

399
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:49,963
Speaker 0: Oh, we shall.

400
00:22:50,694 --> 00:22:51,807
Speaker 0: Oh, let me load them.

401
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:53,808
Speaker 0: Click plain text.

402
00:22:54,571 --> 00:22:55,266
Speaker 0: Alright, here we go.

403
00:22:56,451 --> 00:22:57,057
Speaker 0: Let's go up.

404
00:22:57,097 --> 00:22:58,389
Speaker 0: We're in the letter B. Let's see.

405
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:00,127
Speaker 0: A bellowser.

406
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:03,843
Speaker 0: Transportation for life, i.e.

407
00:23:03,944 --> 00:23:04,507
Speaker 0: as long.

408
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:04,890
Speaker 0: Okay.

409
00:23:05,851 --> 00:23:06,750
Speaker 1: It's not terribly vulgar.

410
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:10,733
Speaker 1: Scott, you do realize- Bible.

411
00:23:10,754 --> 00:23:12,305
Speaker 0: A boat swain's great axe.

412
00:23:12,526 --> 00:23:12,990
Speaker 0: C-term.

413
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:21,450
Speaker 1: So, you do realize, Scott, that vulgar in the vernacular, in that era, basically meant slang.

414
00:23:21,911 --> 00:23:24,810
Speaker 0: I know, but there's many other words in here that are good.

415
00:23:24,910 --> 00:23:27,950
Speaker 1: For example- I'm waiting for you to give me something vulgar in the modern sense.

416
00:23:28,213 --> 00:23:29,229
Speaker 0: Blanket hornpipe.

417
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,288
Speaker 0: The Amorous Congress is what it means.

418
00:23:34,731 --> 00:23:37,930
Speaker 1: Amorous Congress is now my phrase for just about everything, I think.

419
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:39,388
Speaker 0: Okay, let's see.

420
00:23:39,790 --> 00:23:41,870
Speaker 0: A cobble coulter is a turkey.

421
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:44,809
Speaker 1: This is still pretty good.

422
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:49,550
Speaker 0: Cock-a-woop means elevated in high spirits transported with joy.

423
00:23:52,173 --> 00:23:54,230
Speaker 0: Alright, I'm gonna go down to just one more.

424
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:54,630
Speaker 0: Okay.

425
00:23:54,832 --> 00:23:55,230
Speaker 0: Let's see.

426
00:23:56,753 --> 00:23:58,549
Speaker 0: I gotta find a funny one.

427
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,198
Speaker 0: Hertfordshire Kindness.

428
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,340
Speaker 0: Drinking twice to the same person.

429
00:24:07,402 --> 00:24:14,840
Speaker 0: So yeah, this is an excellent dictionary, and if you can somehow learn to speak using only the words in this dictionary, you're made of wind.

430
00:24:15,300 --> 00:24:17,008
Speaker 1: So, my Thing of the Day is also not new.

431
00:24:17,088 --> 00:24:21,159
Speaker 1: In fact, it's not quite 100 years old, but it's way old.

432
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:25,919
Speaker 1: I bring it up mostly because there are many aspects- Thing of the Day, rewind.

433
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:26,949
Speaker 1: -of this thing.

434
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:39,520
Speaker 1: It hasn't been a Thing of the Day before, and I want you to learn what those things are, because I worry I have this suspicion that many of you don't know who Coco the Clown is, nor do you know who Cab Calloway was.

435
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,099
Speaker 0: I think people know who Cab Calloway is.

436
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:43,560
Speaker 1: I wonder, actually.

437
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:50,460
Speaker 1: Well, I'm sure there's punk kids who don't, but I mean- Yeah, our listeners, all of you right now, how many of you actually know who Cab Calloway is?

438
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:50,564
Speaker 0: Me.

439
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,549
Speaker 1: Yeah.

440
00:24:52,401 --> 00:25:03,680
Speaker 1: So, this is a video, an excerpt, from an old cartoon, a Betty Boop cartoon, which, many of you know of Betty Boop, you know Booboo Beauty, and you think of it as this old cartoon kind of thing.

441
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:04,420
Speaker 0: You know what's really funny?

442
00:25:04,742 --> 00:25:07,360
Speaker 0: You see a lot of people who have a whole bunch of Betty Boop shit.

443
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,760
Speaker 1: But have no idea, never seen one.

444
00:25:08,881 --> 00:25:10,860
Speaker 0: But they've never actually watched any of it.

445
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:13,300
Speaker 0: It's just like a character, you know?

446
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:18,220
Speaker 0: It's like a brand of this thing, but they don't actually know any of the source material.

447
00:25:18,461 --> 00:25:23,620
Speaker 1: Betty Boop cartoons are way different from what you probably think they are.

448
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:27,235
Speaker 1: So, this is an excerpt from a Betty Boop.

449
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:39,078
Speaker 1: take on Snow White that also has the great Coco the Clown in it, and Bimbo, and one, I'm amazed as an adult that Betty Boop cartoons were aimed at.

450
00:25:39,118 --> 00:25:43,900
Speaker 1: who they were aimed at, because showing this to a little kid today, it's basically nightmare fuel.

451
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,280
Speaker 0: Well, that's the point.

452
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:46,006
Speaker 0: Exactly.

453
00:25:46,309 --> 00:25:47,300
Speaker 1: This stuff is awesome.

454
00:25:47,966 --> 00:25:49,540
Speaker 0: That's why cartoons and comics are the devil.

455
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:51,980
Speaker 1: But anyway, so this video is great.

456
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:56,011
Speaker 1: Now, the song is great, and a lot of people I've shown this to were like, "Oh, that's a great

457
00:25:56,052 --> 00:25:56,459
Speaker 1: mashup.".

458
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:59,215
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Oh, that's not a mashup.

459
00:25:59,235 --> 00:25:59,899
Speaker 1: That's actually Cab

460
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:00,080
Speaker 1: Calloway.".

461
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,359
Speaker 0: That's the original real deal.

462
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:02,798
Speaker 0: Who do you think this is?

463
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:08,420
Speaker 1: Cab Calloway sang this song, and they rotoscoped animated him dancing for Coco the Clown in this.

464
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,460
Speaker 1: This is for real Cab Calloway.

465
00:26:11,181 --> 00:26:14,640
Speaker 1: If you don't know who Cab Calloway is, remember the Blues Brothers?

466
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,199
Speaker 0: Kill yourself.

467
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,510
Speaker 0: Remember the Blues Brothers?

468
00:26:16,732 --> 00:26:17,780
Speaker 1: Remember the awesome guy?

469
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:21,380
Speaker 0: Listen, if you don't know who Cab Calloway is, you don't know who the Blues Brothers are either.

470
00:26:21,501 --> 00:26:23,020
Speaker 1: So there's a movie called The Blues Brothers.

471
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,842
Speaker 1: Not Blues Brothers 2000.

472
00:26:25,842 --> 00:26:26,579
Speaker 1: The Blues Brothers.

473
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,994
Speaker 1: And it has a character in it.

474
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:30,879
Speaker 1: I am on a mission.

475
00:26:33,003 --> 00:26:34,620
Speaker 1: A listener reminded me of our old promo.

476
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:43,661
Speaker 1: I forget even what it was, but we did a promo that was a take on the Blues Brothers that got played on Anime World Order in 2005.

477
00:26:43,661 --> 00:26:48,038
Speaker 1: So Cab Calloway played a guy who sang a song you may have heard called "A Mini the

478
00:26:48,098 --> 00:26:48,460
Speaker 1: Moocher.".

479
00:26:49,381 --> 00:26:52,240
Speaker 1: Cab Calloway is one of the greatest human beings to ever exist.

480
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,078
Speaker 0: I don't know about that.

481
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,740
Speaker 1: Hey, greatest musicians.

482
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:55,693
Speaker 0: He was cool.

483
00:26:55,755 --> 00:26:56,040
Speaker 0: He's not?

484
00:26:57,807 --> 00:26:58,131
Speaker 0: How many?

485
00:26:58,172 --> 00:26:58,840
Speaker 0: Wait, top what?

486
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,822
Speaker 1: Top 500.

487
00:27:00,822 --> 00:27:02,340
Speaker 0: Okay, sure, 500.

488
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:02,428
Speaker 0: Yeah.

489
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:03,900
Speaker 0: That's a little too lenient.

490
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:05,860
Speaker 1: How many musicians have existed in the world?

491
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:07,489
Speaker 1: I think he's in the top 500.

492
00:27:07,489 --> 00:27:07,698
Speaker 0: Okay.

493
00:27:07,901 --> 00:27:08,418
Speaker 1: I like Cab Calloway.

494
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:10,425
Speaker 0: I'll give him the top 500.

495
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:11,938
Speaker 1: But anyway, watch this.

496
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:13,979
Speaker 1: Learn who Cab Calloway was.

497
00:27:14,461 --> 00:27:15,559
Speaker 1: Learn who the Blues Brothers are.

498
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,700
Speaker 1: Learn about Betty Boop and Coco the Clown.

499
00:27:18,181 --> 00:27:19,320
Speaker 1: And the Fleischer Brothers.

500
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,640
Speaker 1: And you will be on a road to internet excellence.

501
00:27:24,442 --> 00:27:25,860
Speaker 1: That all aside, we got the meta moment.

502
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:29,133
Speaker 1: We will be at the Penny Arcade Expo East 2012 over Easter weekend.

503
00:27:31,841 --> 00:27:32,084
Speaker 1: East.

504
00:27:32,347 --> 00:27:32,834
Speaker 1: Ha ha.

505
00:27:32,935 --> 00:27:33,219
Speaker 1: Get it?

506
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:34,350
Speaker 0: If you're not there, you suck.

507
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:36,679
Speaker 1: If you didn't get a badge?

508
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:37,340
Speaker 0: Stop listening.

509
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:37,987
Speaker 1: You're fucked.

510
00:27:38,007 --> 00:27:38,453
Speaker 1: You can't.

511
00:27:38,534 --> 00:27:38,960
Speaker 1: Too late.

512
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,860
Speaker 1: However, they still need enforcers.

513
00:27:42,042 --> 00:27:44,059
Speaker 0: If you enforce, you're the opposite of suck.

514
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,680
Speaker 1: In fact, you are a gentleman and a scholar and you get all my respect.

515
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,019
Speaker 0: Or a gentle lady and a scholar.

516
00:27:49,942 --> 00:27:51,239
Speaker 0: Or a gentle person and a scholar.

517
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,008
Speaker 1: We are doing so far.

518
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:52,980
Speaker 1: We'll have our schedule up soon.

519
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:53,765
Speaker 1: One lecture.

520
00:27:54,168 --> 00:27:55,599
Speaker 1: Let's play a money making game.

521
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,839
Speaker 1: All about monetization models and games.

522
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:01,540
Speaker 1: We are doing a two hour workshop on tabletop gaming.

523
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:03,680
Speaker 1: The title and schedule to be announced.

524
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:06,560
Speaker 1: That will basically be, it's in a classroom panel room.

525
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,618
Speaker 1: It's going to be a big panel room.

526
00:28:08,022 --> 00:28:08,585
Speaker 1: Tons of seats.

527
00:28:08,906 --> 00:28:09,349
Speaker 1: Stage.

528
00:28:10,133 --> 00:28:10,676
Speaker 1: Projector.

529
00:28:10,997 --> 00:28:11,520
Speaker 1: Webcam.

530
00:28:12,202 --> 00:28:13,820
Speaker 1: And all the seats have tables.

531
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,079
Speaker 1: We're going to teach people how to play some German fucking games.

532
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:17,498
Speaker 0: And how to win too.

533
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:21,840
Speaker 1: The documentary that is, it almost makes me blush.

534
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:24,640
Speaker 1: Because it portrays us in very glowing terms.

535
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:28,100
Speaker 1: Going Cardboard, which we were featured fairly prominent in by Lauren Green.

536
00:28:28,461 --> 00:28:29,420
Speaker 1: We'll be having a screening.

537
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,259
Speaker 1: We will try to be at that screening beforehand to say hi.

538
00:28:32,701 --> 00:28:33,719
Speaker 1: Maybe answer some questions.

539
00:28:34,781 --> 00:28:35,509
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

540
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:36,520
Speaker 0: We didn't make the movie.

541
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:37,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we're in it.

542
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,277
Speaker 0: We're in it more than we should be.

543
00:28:40,542 --> 00:28:43,280
Speaker 1: And we will be slipping over to Anime Boston.

544
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,800
Speaker 1: I think Friday afternoon evening.

545
00:28:46,221 --> 00:28:47,940
Speaker 1: To do at least one panel, one lecture.

546
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,280
Speaker 1: Diamonds in the Rough.

547
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:54,420
Speaker 1: Which for all those in the know is just another title for Anime You Should See with a different list of anime.

548
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,139
Speaker 0: That's right.

549
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,498
Speaker 1: And yes, so Paxis is going to be pretty fucking ballin'.

550
00:29:00,068 --> 00:29:00,256
Speaker 0: No.

551
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:00,725
Speaker 0: Yeah.

552
00:29:01,241 --> 00:29:01,820
Speaker 0: You don't say.

553
00:29:03,484 --> 00:29:04,739
Speaker 0: What is the book club book?

554
00:29:05,325 --> 00:29:06,119
Speaker 1: I haven't decided yet.

555
00:29:06,264 --> 00:29:06,679
Speaker 0: Good job.

556
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:08,279
Speaker 1: Hey, you push me.

557
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,280
Speaker 1: I'll pick a fucking book and you're not going to be happy.

558
00:29:10,661 --> 00:29:11,179
Speaker 0: So, we should.

559
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,799
Speaker 0: I just want to remind people the internets exist.

560
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:15,819
Speaker 0: And this show is called Geek Nights.

561
00:29:16,420 --> 00:29:18,240
Speaker 0: But our website is not geeknights.com.

562
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,199
Speaker 0: It's frontrecruit.com.

563
00:29:19,561 --> 00:29:20,098
Speaker 1: Don't ask why.

564
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:20,958
Speaker 0: You should go there.

565
00:29:21,602 --> 00:29:23,119
Speaker 0: You should also go to the forum that's there.

566
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:25,780
Speaker 1: You should go to the Geek Nights from YouTube channel.

567
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,300
Speaker 1: Which has many of our lectures and other things from Geek Nights.

568
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:33,000
Speaker 0: And you can go to Twitter, Facebook, or Google+ to follow us.

569
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:34,399
Speaker 0: Wherever you are on the internets.

570
00:29:34,561 --> 00:29:37,220
Speaker 1: If you're a fan of the ponies, you should check out the other show we launched.

571
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,500
Speaker 1: Radio Free Equestria.

572
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:41,080
Speaker 0: Anywhere on the internets that you are, we are also there.

573
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,459
Speaker 0: So you should hook up with us.

574
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,138
Speaker 1: There's lots of stuff from us.

575
00:29:44,401 --> 00:29:46,459
Speaker 0: Front row crew, Geek Nights, whatever it is.

576
00:29:46,683 --> 00:29:46,876
Speaker 0: Yes.

577
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:47,718
Speaker 0: Look for it.

578
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:51,020
Speaker 1: So, I talked about this as kind of a geek bite a long time ago.

579
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:55,100
Speaker 1: But Scott has now played the game and we're in fact running a campaign of the game.

580
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,118
Speaker 1: So, I think it's about time to do a proper show on the game.

581
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:01,159
Speaker 0: And we had no other game that we've played recently to do a show on.

582
00:30:01,463 --> 00:30:02,800
Speaker 1: Well, I've been playing a bunch of games.

583
00:30:03,383 --> 00:30:05,720
Speaker 1: But a bunch of games means I have a flow chart.

584
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,157
Speaker 1: Every day when I get home from work, I think, "Can I play Tribes

585
00:30:09,157 --> 00:30:09,821
Speaker 1: 2?".

586
00:30:09,821 --> 00:30:12,356
Speaker 1: If the answer is no, I think, "Can I play

587
00:30:12,517 --> 00:30:12,618
Speaker 1: NS2?"

588
00:30:13,161 --> 00:30:16,917
Speaker 1: If all the servers are full and/or empty, I think, "Am I playing

589
00:30:16,957 --> 00:30:17,500
Speaker 1: Counter-Strike?".

590
00:30:18,804 --> 00:30:19,757
Speaker 1: So, I've been playing a lot of NS2.

591
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,080
Speaker 0: I usually do that, but lately I added a question in the beginning.

592
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,199
Speaker 0: Which is, "Have I seen every episode of Running Man

593
00:30:25,219 --> 00:30:25,320
Speaker 0: yet?".

594
00:30:25,883 --> 00:30:26,137
Speaker 1: You know.

595
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,159
Speaker 0: And Dilly answers yes.

596
00:30:28,261 --> 00:30:29,720
Speaker 1: I can't be super down on you.

597
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:30,399
Speaker 0: Counter-Strike is on a hold.

598
00:30:30,923 --> 00:30:33,500
Speaker 1: Because I've been playing all this stuff.

599
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,320
Speaker 1: And I've also been kind of watching some Running Man.

600
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,768
Speaker 1: And while I haven't diven in 100%, it's pretty good.

601
00:30:39,321 --> 00:30:40,300
Speaker 0: It's really interesting.

602
00:30:41,323 --> 00:30:42,280
Speaker 0: And it eats up all your time.

603
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,500
Speaker 0: Because each episode is like as long.

604
00:30:43,961 --> 00:30:48,340
Speaker 0: The amount of Running Man's I've watched, I could have finished like two more pages of IMDb Top.

605
00:30:48,541 --> 00:30:57,100
Speaker 0: Actually, the reason I haven't progressed on my IMDb Top 250 thingy is because the movie I currently have for Netflix is Once Upon a Time in America.

606
00:30:57,644 --> 00:30:58,640
Speaker 0: Which is two DVDs.

607
00:30:59,163 --> 00:31:01,880
Speaker 0: Which means it's probably like five hours or some shit like that.

608
00:31:02,261 --> 00:31:04,658
Speaker 1: I did also recently watch Inception again.

609
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,533
Speaker 0: Again?

610
00:31:05,595 --> 00:31:05,678
Speaker 0: Why?

611
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,676
Speaker 1: Because Emily had never seen it.

612
00:31:07,164 --> 00:31:07,260
Speaker 1: Okay.

613
00:31:07,420 --> 00:31:07,788
Speaker 1: You know what?

614
00:31:07,829 --> 00:31:08,360
Speaker 1: Watching it again.

615
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:09,420
Speaker 0: You didn't go with us to see it?

616
00:31:09,541 --> 00:31:10,860
Speaker 1: No, she was out of town or something.

617
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:13,160
Speaker 1: But watching it again, it was just as good as the first time.

618
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:13,660
Speaker 1: Because...

619
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:13,996
Speaker 0: It was okay.

620
00:31:14,784 --> 00:31:15,279
Speaker 0: Good movie.

621
00:31:16,263 --> 00:31:17,620
Speaker 1: There was a lot of little subtle bits.

622
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:19,400
Speaker 1: Like I forgot my favorite line in the whole movie.

623
00:31:20,143 --> 00:31:22,916
Speaker 1: Near the end where the guy's like, "I really wanted to see what was going to happen in

624
00:31:22,936 --> 00:31:23,117
Speaker 1: there.".

625
00:31:24,111 --> 00:31:24,380
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

626
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:25,559
Speaker 1: I love that guy.

627
00:31:26,781 --> 00:31:29,139
Speaker 1: Anyway, A Thousand and One Nights is a role-playing game.

628
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:30,789
Speaker 1: One of those indie RPGs.

629
00:31:31,641 --> 00:31:32,640
Speaker 0: By Megway Baker.

630
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:37,460
Speaker 1: Megway Baker, who actually is related to the gaming world in a lot of ways.

631
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,023
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.

632
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:40,420
Speaker 1: We'll talk about her history after we talk about the game.

633
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:45,937
Speaker 1: The game is... I've also described it as "Yo, dawg, I heard you like

634
00:31:45,977 --> 00:31:46,480
Speaker 1: role-playing.".

635
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,160
Speaker 1: So I put some role-playing into a role-playing.

636
00:31:48,260 --> 00:31:48,734
Speaker 0: That's right.

637
00:31:48,755 --> 00:31:48,940
Speaker 0: See?

638
00:31:49,001 --> 00:31:50,500
Speaker 1: Which is why I brought up Inception.

639
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:51,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, guys.

640
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:52,819
Speaker 0: So this is how this game works, right?

641
00:31:53,062 --> 00:31:54,139
Speaker 0: It's A Thousand and One Nights.

642
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,713
Speaker 0: You know, Arabian Nights.

643
00:31:55,774 --> 00:31:56,320
Speaker 0: Those kinds.

644
00:31:57,060 --> 00:32:00,040
Speaker 0: Everyone plays someone in the Sultan's Court, but you're not the Sultan.

645
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,539
Speaker 0: You can't be the Sultan, even though I wanted to be.

646
00:32:02,241 --> 00:32:03,319
Speaker 0: So, who are you, Rim?

647
00:32:04,524 --> 00:32:06,459
Speaker 1: In this current game... Oh my god.

648
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,778
Speaker 1: I got my character sheet.

649
00:32:08,223 --> 00:32:08,640
Speaker 1: Give me a second.

650
00:32:09,605 --> 00:32:10,340
Speaker 0: I got mine on my desk.

651
00:32:12,683 --> 00:32:14,660
Speaker 1: I am Walid Al Abbas, the court physician.

652
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,460
Speaker 0: I'm Dhanash Al-Tubby, the food taster.

653
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,640
Speaker 1: But in the most recent one, I was also the all-powerful genie.

654
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:24,200
Speaker 1: What grants, basically, no wishes.

655
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:29,580
Speaker 0: Right, so the way it works is that you're all in the court, and everyone in the court envies something about everyone else in the court.

656
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,380
Speaker 0: So, and at the same time, you sit there and you trash-talk each other in the court.

657
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:38,280
Speaker 0: And you don't want to get punished by the Sultan, because that means... Right?

658
00:32:39,201 --> 00:32:45,157
Speaker 0: So, you're all smack-talking without getting punished, and eventually, somebody says, "Ah, let me tell you a

659
00:32:45,238 --> 00:32:45,680
Speaker 0: story.".

660
00:32:46,886 --> 00:32:47,798
Speaker 0: Ah, and then it's on!

661
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:54,120
Speaker 0: Suddenly, there's a new story, and everyone is now a new character in that story.

662
00:32:54,441 --> 00:32:56,399
Speaker 0: It's role-playing in your role-play.

663
00:32:56,980 --> 00:33:05,020
Speaker 1: The famous example I use in every lecture where we talk about this, and I think I used it when I geeked at this RPG way back, was the first game of what we played.

664
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,700
Speaker 1: Our friend Pete played the eunuch, Mustafa bin Mustafa.

665
00:33:09,722 --> 00:33:15,800
Speaker 1: And Mustafa bin Mustafa really envied my character, the Dhanuan lover, court poet, whatever.

666
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,000
Speaker 0: Because you had a dick.

667
00:33:18,363 --> 00:33:19,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, he envied my penis.

668
00:33:19,502 --> 00:33:20,139
Speaker 0: That's right.

669
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,860
Speaker 1: So, he was telling a story.

670
00:33:24,560 --> 00:33:28,360
Speaker 1: The story of the brave and powerful eunuch who saved the day.

671
00:33:28,981 --> 00:33:32,599
Speaker 1: But he made me, the lover boy, play the eunuch.

672
00:33:33,361 --> 00:33:34,699
Speaker 1: You know, put me in his shoes.

673
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:41,400
Speaker 1: So, being awesome, me, my character doesn't like him, and I'm in this role.

674
00:33:41,921 --> 00:33:46,259
Speaker 1: So, me, I have my character play this role in the following way.

675
00:33:47,020 --> 00:33:51,740
Speaker 1: Herp-de-der, I am der eunuch, big and stupid, no penis have I.

676
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,079
Speaker 0: I'm better, better.

677
00:33:55,223 --> 00:33:57,000
Speaker 1: And that is the essence of this game.

678
00:33:57,220 --> 00:34:02,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, you play a person playing a person, and it's like you have to meta out, and there's three levels.

679
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:11,179
Speaker 0: There's you, the real you, you, your number one character, and you, the character in the story that your character is pretending to be.

680
00:34:12,001 --> 00:34:12,793
Speaker 0: It's like, oh my gosh.

681
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:16,420
Speaker 1: Let's talk about the mechanics of the game before we really get into it.

682
00:34:16,601 --> 00:34:17,899
Speaker 0: So, one person telling the story.

683
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:22,313
Speaker 1: So, basically, you've got a character, and every character has a goal.

684
00:34:24,101 --> 00:34:26,780
Speaker 1: Their actual goal, like Oelie de la Basse, has a goal.

685
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:29,840
Speaker 1: He wants the new sultan to submit to his physical examinations.

686
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,340
Speaker 1: The new sultan refuses to seek his doctorly wisdom.

687
00:34:34,204 --> 00:34:35,560
Speaker 1: So, that's my goal.

688
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:37,059
Speaker 1: My character's working toward that.

689
00:34:37,780 --> 00:34:42,219
Speaker 1: And you play, you alternate between playing a story and playing just in the court.

690
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:45,620
Speaker 1: And in the court, you kind of just role play in character.

691
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:48,060
Speaker 1: The game is designed to be primarily in the first person.

692
00:34:48,380 --> 00:34:52,918
Speaker 1: The book encourages you to lounge, to have figs and dates and raisins and pistachios.

693
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,820
Speaker 0: They're trying to sell pistachios, they're too mad expensive.

694
00:34:56,760 --> 00:35:07,880
Speaker 1: To drape yourselves and really get into the character of it, and it's talking first person, and it amazes me every time I see this game run that people really get into character way more than any other role playing game.

695
00:35:07,941 --> 00:35:09,337
Speaker 1: I've seen people play outside of LARP's.

696
00:35:10,040 --> 00:35:14,940
Speaker 1: Like, it really brings in all the good stuff of a LARP without all the bad stuff of a LARP.

697
00:35:15,503 --> 00:35:21,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, because, you know, most LARP's, it's like, well, you go around hitting people with swords and stuff.

698
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:23,220
Speaker 0: Well, in this one, there's none of that.

699
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:28,320
Speaker 0: So, actually, even, you know, it's like, well, we're going to role play a bunch of people laying around telling stories.

700
00:35:29,061 --> 00:35:35,720
Speaker 0: Oh, so we're LARPing and we're still not doing anything that we wouldn't do at the tabletop because we're role playing as people sitting around telling stories.

701
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,056
Speaker 1: In fact, Scott's character basically pulled the, "Is there any Mountain

702
00:35:39,076 --> 00:35:39,359
Speaker 1: Dew?".

703
00:35:39,603 --> 00:35:40,699
Speaker 1: He wanted a bunch of wine.

704
00:35:40,863 --> 00:35:41,359
Speaker 0: That's right.

705
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:45,680
Speaker 1: But, so your character has a goal and you have all these people around you that you envy.

706
00:35:46,340 --> 00:35:52,740
Speaker 1: But you cannot do anything to mechanically advance towards your goal in the court.

707
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,240
Speaker 1: There is nothing you can do.

708
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,180
Speaker 1: Role play all you want, doesn't the fuck matter.

709
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,300
Speaker 1: But once a story starts, you accumulate dice.

710
00:36:00,741 --> 00:36:06,497
Speaker 1: And at the end of the story, you can allocate those dice to achieve your goal in the real, in the court.

711
00:36:07,444 --> 00:36:07,796
Speaker 0: Or freedom.

712
00:36:08,322 --> 00:36:11,600
Speaker 1: From now on, we'll call him real life, court, and story.

713
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:12,499
Speaker 1: Those are the three levels.

714
00:36:12,961 --> 00:36:14,459
Speaker 1: So, in the story, you get these dice.

715
00:36:14,642 --> 00:36:15,840
Speaker 1: At the end, you allocate them, you roll.

716
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:32,600
Speaker 1: And if you make movement at the end of a story toward your goal, when you go back to court, you and all the other players kind of set the scene and then role play out, you know, the successes and failures based on the roles that you earned from the story.

717
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:34,520
Speaker 0: So I do really well in the story.

718
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:38,780
Speaker 0: When we go back to court, I could earn my freedom and escape the court.

719
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:45,760
Speaker 1: Or my character, Walid Al Abbas, did not want the new wife, the wife of the new sultan, to get her goal.

720
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,999
Speaker 1: So I dicked her in the dice rolling part.

721
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,000
Speaker 1: So then we had to roll--.

722
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, you can attack other people with your dice.

723
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:53,680
Speaker 1: Yep, so we had to role play out how my character dicked her.

724
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:58,820
Speaker 1: Basically, in court, you now know the outcome, whether or not you made progress.

725
00:36:59,181 --> 00:37:00,960
Speaker 1: And then you have to role play out that progress.

726
00:37:01,121 --> 00:37:02,079
Speaker 0: And then you tell another story.

727
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:12,580
Speaker 1: So, the mechanics of the story are incredibly elegant, and they really encourage a fast-paced, free-form role playing system that it takes a while to get good at.

728
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,471
Speaker 1: I don't know how many times I lost a die because I look at it and I'm like, "What the fuck was

729
00:37:15,512 --> 00:37:15,695
Speaker 1: this?".

730
00:37:16,161 --> 00:37:21,039
Speaker 0: Right, so the way it works is, while someone's telling the story, you can ask questions.

731
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:27,180
Speaker 0: Now, if you're normal at the game, you're going to do-- Right, the first thing you're going to do is just sort of ask questions directly.

732
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,993
Speaker 0: Like, you know, "Oh, there's a lamp.

733
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:30,998
Speaker 0: Is there a genie in the

734
00:37:31,038 --> 00:37:31,320
Speaker 0: lamp?".

735
00:37:31,461 --> 00:37:32,068
Speaker 0: Right?

736
00:37:32,088 --> 00:37:33,099
Speaker 0: Or stuff like that.

737
00:37:33,341 --> 00:37:36,280
Speaker 0: And, you know, you're just going to go ask basic stuff.

738
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:37,348
Speaker 0: Like, "What's the name of the

739
00:37:37,388 --> 00:37:37,933
Speaker 0: genie?".

740
00:37:38,074 --> 00:37:38,620
Speaker 0: That kind of thing.

741
00:37:39,462 --> 00:37:44,980
Speaker 0: When you level up, you're going to realize that you get the die, and you get to roll the die when the question is answered.

742
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,160
Speaker 0: So, you're going to ask a question right before it's about to be answered.

743
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,199
Speaker 0: That's strategy number two.

744
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:57,237
Speaker 1: You can see how, when people started to figure this out, because then, you know, I was the genie, and I was like, "I will grant you but one

745
00:37:57,298 --> 00:37:57,640
Speaker 1: wish.".

746
00:37:57,721 --> 00:37:59,919
Speaker 0: And then everyone's like, "How many wishes will it

747
00:37:59,939 --> 00:37:59,980
Speaker 0: be?".

748
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:00,797
Speaker 1: "Who's going to ask a

749
00:38:00,817 --> 00:38:00,899
Speaker 1: wish?".

750
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,659
Speaker 1: And then everyone asks all these questions all at once.

751
00:38:02,962 --> 00:38:03,466
Speaker 0: Right.

752
00:38:03,546 --> 00:38:05,380
Speaker 0: You know, you ask it right before it's about to be answered.

753
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,015
Speaker 0: Like, you know, "The guy is rubbing the

754
00:38:08,136 --> 00:38:08,679
Speaker 0: lamp."

755
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:09,817
Speaker 0: And it's like, "Does the genie come

756
00:38:09,918 --> 00:38:09,979
Speaker 0: out?".

757
00:38:10,081 --> 00:38:12,040
Speaker 0: It's like, you're going to get to roll that die immediately.

758
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:17,900
Speaker 1: Now, you kind of want to make life difficult for the storyteller, because they're the ones who can accrue the most dice.

759
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:18,402
Speaker 0: That's right.

760
00:38:18,422 --> 00:38:31,900
Speaker 0: So, the third, the highest level strategy, is the same strategy you use when building character sheets for the players in Dread, which is to ask the question with the assumed information in it.

761
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:41,313
Speaker 0: For example, right, if the guy's rubbing a lamp, right, and a genie's about to come out, do not ask, right, "Does the genie come

762
00:38:41,496 --> 00:38:41,597
Speaker 0: out?".

763
00:38:42,121 --> 00:38:47,659
Speaker 0: Ask, "Why does the genie that comes out get so pissed

764
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,040
Speaker 0: off?".

765
00:38:48,201 --> 00:38:52,940
Speaker 0: Now, you've basically, you asked a question, but you've also told the story.

766
00:38:53,162 --> 00:38:58,240
Speaker 0: Now, there has to be a genie that comes out, and it has to be pissed off, right?

767
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:10,780
Speaker 0: It's like, that is the highest level strategy you can get, which is, you basically tell the story, attack the story, force the storyteller to go in a direction they didn't want to go, take control away from them, with your leading asshole questions.

768
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:17,920
Speaker 1: Because, the way the mechanics work is, every time you raise a question, you take a die, and all your dice look the same, and you put it in front of you.

769
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,399
Speaker 1: You can have up to five out at a time.

770
00:39:19,922 --> 00:39:24,960
Speaker 1: You only get that die and put it in your cup for a roll later, if the question is addressed.

771
00:39:25,601 --> 00:39:28,020
Speaker 1: But, if you forget what the question is, it's gone.

772
00:39:28,406 --> 00:39:29,139
Speaker 1: You just lose it.

773
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:31,780
Speaker 1: You have to, you know, just toss it off your table and keep trying.

774
00:39:32,381 --> 00:39:39,299
Speaker 1: So, you, every player, you know, if there's five players, there can be twenty questions out, and the person telling the story has to answer all of them.

775
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,640
Speaker 1: Whenever a question is answered, the die is rolled.

776
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:49,739
Speaker 1: If it's, I forget if it's even or odd or what, but basically, if it's even, the person who rolled it gets to keep it and put it in their cup.

777
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:53,120
Speaker 1: If it's odd, the storyteller gets to keep it and put it in their cup.

778
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:56,429
Speaker 0: Alright, so the storyteller basically wants to get, the story's over.

779
00:39:56,469 --> 00:39:58,100
Speaker 0: when the storyteller gets a certain number of dice.

780
00:39:58,260 --> 00:39:58,759
Speaker 1: I think it's eight.

781
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,960
Speaker 0: So they want to answer as many of those questions as they can, as quickly as possible.

782
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:14,517
Speaker 1: But, they cannot end the story until either, all the, once they've reached, you know, their eight, then they can only end the story by addressing every person's question out there.

783
00:40:15,542 --> 00:40:31,979
Speaker 1: Or, they can give up, I think, half their dice, like they give up a number of their dice to interrupt the story, and then they cut immediately back to court, and they narrate some sort of interruption, like, a war breaks out, a bunch of guards come in, the assault passes out and vomits.

784
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:38,879
Speaker 0: If there's too many dick questions, right, then the storyteller has to do that, which is why asking dick questions is the best.

785
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:47,299
Speaker 0: 'Cause it's like, imagine if all my questions are these leading questions, and the GM's just like, I don't want to bring the story in any of those directions, but I got five dick dice out.

786
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:49,093
Speaker 0: How long is the genie's dick?

787
00:40:50,482 --> 00:40:52,080
Speaker 1: Does the unit get his dick back?

788
00:40:53,143 --> 00:40:53,929
Speaker 0: No, it's not.

789
00:40:54,029 --> 00:40:59,159
Speaker 0: does the unit get his dick back, it's how big is the new dick the unit just got?

790
00:40:59,740 --> 00:41:03,000
Speaker 1: I remember in one game I asked the question, does the assassination attempt succeed?

791
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:07,200
Speaker 1: And the storyteller says, there was no, and then stops and says, fuck you, Rem.

792
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:09,700
Speaker 0: Right, who rapes the unit in the butt?

793
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:11,980
Speaker 0: Who just stabbed the sultan?

794
00:41:12,420 --> 00:41:14,198
Speaker 1: You don't have to be a dick like Scott is.

795
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:17,128
Speaker 0: What method of murder was just used on Rem?

796
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:25,033
Speaker 1: The point of all this is that the mechanics are very simple, and you have this meta goal.

797
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:30,000
Speaker 1: As a player, you're just trying to get as many fucking dice as possible.

798
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:36,480
Speaker 1: As a character, your character wants to get as many dice as possible too.

799
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:37,980
Speaker 0: And be a jerk as much as possible.

800
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:47,180
Speaker 1: No, he just wants to get as many dice as possible for himself as well, without letting other people get a lot of dice, because you want to roll as many dice as possible to get what your character wants.

801
00:41:47,220 --> 00:41:50,420
Speaker 1: So your player's goals and your character's goals are together.

802
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:58,919
Speaker 1: But in the story, your goal is basically as a character, just to make the story cool, just to have fun.

803
00:41:59,982 --> 00:42:10,639
Speaker 1: So the mechanics are very simple, but yet what tends to happen every time I see this play is that the stories that are told are really, really interesting and go in surprising directions.

804
00:42:11,341 --> 00:42:17,212
Speaker 1: And the theme and the color and the flavor text are all really great, especially because it's a story.

805
00:42:17,253 --> 00:42:18,540
Speaker 1: Sometimes you're all role-playing.

806
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,340
Speaker 1: Sometimes you're narrating.

807
00:42:20,820 --> 00:42:24,220
Speaker 1: Sometimes the storyteller will stop everyone and narrate the rest of the story.

808
00:42:25,283 --> 00:42:26,840
Speaker 1: And then the other people are just asking questions.

809
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:29,800
Speaker 1: So the storytelling style changes based on the kind of story you're telling.

810
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:30,920
Speaker 0: It also benefits you.

811
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:36,230
Speaker 0: If you're a storyteller that can just keep going and keep going and the story's captivating, no one's going to ask questions.

812
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:39,520
Speaker 0: Because they're all ensnared by your story.

813
00:42:40,684 --> 00:42:45,460
Speaker 0: So it actually directly rewards you for storytelling skills.

814
00:42:46,223 --> 00:42:50,160
Speaker 0: And likewise, the asking of questions isn't actually asking questions.

815
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,300
Speaker 0: I mean, it can be, but those are low-level questions.

816
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:56,540
Speaker 0: The high level is actually storytelling through asking questions.

817
00:42:56,860 --> 00:43:04,620
Speaker 0: So again, directly rewarded for telling stories in a game about stories called A Thousand and One Arabian Nights, which is a story about stories.

818
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:07,220
Speaker 1: Now this game, I mean, other games teach you how to role-play.

819
00:43:07,320 --> 00:43:11,980
Speaker 1: Like Burning Wheel teaches you how to introduce conflict and fuck everything for everyone.

820
00:43:12,662 --> 00:43:13,520
Speaker 1: Because that's awesome.

821
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:21,620
Speaker 1: This game, if you play it a lot, kind of like how DDR teaches you to move your feet in a certain way, you'll suddenly find that you're a better storyteller.

822
00:43:21,782 --> 00:43:22,800
Speaker 1: if you play this game a bunch.

823
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:23,959
Speaker 1: Like, for real, straight up.

824
00:43:24,206 --> 00:43:24,356
Speaker 0: Maybe.

825
00:43:24,885 --> 00:43:25,299
Speaker 1: I think so.

826
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:26,820
Speaker 1: I've played it more than anyone in our crew.

827
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:27,938
Speaker 1: I've played three games of it.

828
00:43:28,386 --> 00:43:29,000
Speaker 1: Whoa, three times.

829
00:43:29,102 --> 00:43:29,820
Speaker 1: Oh shit, son.

830
00:43:30,446 --> 00:43:31,139
Speaker 0: So many times.

831
00:43:31,481 --> 00:43:34,260
Speaker 1: And I cannot praise this game enough.

832
00:43:34,965 --> 00:43:35,638
Speaker 1: I love it.

833
00:43:35,801 --> 00:43:37,520
Speaker 1: It's one of my favorite role-playing games.

834
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:44,059
Speaker 0: It's also a game that can be done in the one shot or in the many shot, which is very good, because there aren't too many role-playing games that do that well.

835
00:43:44,301 --> 00:43:45,260
Speaker 0: They're usually one or the other.

836
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:50,240
Speaker 1: So the mechanic at the end, so the story ends, and then everyone takes their dice and allocates them into three pools.

837
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:54,740
Speaker 1: Safety, their goal or their desire, and freedom.

838
00:43:55,361 --> 00:43:58,320
Speaker 1: Because you cannot get freedom from the Sultan's court.

839
00:43:58,441 --> 00:43:59,158
Speaker 1: You're trapped there.

840
00:43:59,601 --> 00:44:00,519
Speaker 1: Everyone is trapped there.

841
00:44:01,201 --> 00:44:05,200
Speaker 1: You can advance the court story by, you know, you have your desire.

842
00:44:05,301 --> 00:44:07,380
Speaker 1: I allocate three dice to desire.

843
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:08,055
Speaker 1: I roll them.

844
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,800
Speaker 1: Every even, I get toward my desire.

845
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:15,220
Speaker 1: And if I get a certain number of dice, I think it's five or eight, I forget, I get my desire.

846
00:44:15,761 --> 00:44:18,880
Speaker 1: And we're going to straight up role-play me getting my desire, whatever I wanted.

847
00:44:18,940 --> 00:44:22,519
Speaker 1: If I wanted to bang the Sultan's wife, I do it.

848
00:44:23,265 --> 00:44:23,449
Speaker 0: I get it.

849
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,280
Speaker 1: But I can also go for freedom, which basically means the Sultan gives me my leave to leave his court.

850
00:44:30,441 --> 00:44:31,500
Speaker 0: Or you escape or something.

851
00:44:31,580 --> 00:44:32,739
Speaker 1: Yes, my character is gone.

852
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:33,559
Speaker 0: And you don't get caught.

853
00:44:34,361 --> 00:44:36,380
Speaker 1: Safety, you've got three strikes.

854
00:44:36,661 --> 00:44:37,680
Speaker 0: You have to do safety.

855
00:44:38,101 --> 00:44:41,960
Speaker 1: On the third strike, the Sultan fucking beheads you and your character's dead.

856
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:42,849
Speaker 0: That's right.

857
00:44:43,092 --> 00:44:43,779
Speaker 0: Don't fuck that up.

858
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:45,980
Speaker 1: You cannot ever undo a strike.

859
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,659
Speaker 1: So if you allocate dice to safety, you need at least one even or you get a strike.

860
00:44:51,201 --> 00:44:54,740
Speaker 1: Usually, in our most recent game, didn't put anything into safety.

861
00:44:54,840 --> 00:44:58,760
Speaker 1: He took a strike to get the maximum chance of getting his goal.

862
00:44:59,060 --> 00:45:01,999
Speaker 0: And he rolled an incredible five on five dice.

863
00:45:02,281 --> 00:45:02,960
Speaker 1: It was amazing.

864
00:45:03,064 --> 00:45:03,519
Speaker 0: Who cheated.

865
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:05,159
Speaker 0: But he got his desire.

866
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:06,800
Speaker 1: So here's the final mechanic.

867
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:11,180
Speaker 1: I said in the beginning that I spent some of my dice to dick over one of the other characters.

868
00:45:11,660 --> 00:45:16,320
Speaker 1: You can spend dice to remove two dice from another character's goal pool.

869
00:45:16,581 --> 00:45:18,100
Speaker 0: But not their freedom, only their desire.

870
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:19,840
Speaker 1: Yes, so you can always go for freedom.

871
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:22,379
Speaker 0: So if we would have attacked Alex's desire, we could have stopped him.

872
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:37,967
Speaker 1: So a generally conservative play is to put two or three dice in safety every time, put a couple of dice in desire every time, but build up a freedom to where, say things go to shit, you know, five or six sessions in and you've got two strikes and you're not doing so.

873
00:45:38,007 --> 00:45:42,060
Speaker 1: well, you might dump it all into freedom to just escape because you don't want to kill the character.

874
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:46,180
Speaker 1: You want him to be out there to maybe, you know, enrich the world or come back someday.

875
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:47,259
Speaker 1: You don't want him to just die.

876
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:53,799
Speaker 1: So the game has all these interesting interplays and this depth does something else amazing.

877
00:45:55,861 --> 00:45:59,979
Speaker 1: Players refer to other characters by name more so in this game than any role-playing game I've ever played.

878
00:46:00,161 --> 00:46:07,840
Speaker 0: Usually when you play a tabletop role-playing game, you always forget the other character's names and if you're playing with strangers at a convention, you forget the real names too, right?

879
00:46:08,380 --> 00:46:13,160
Speaker 0: But this game, like I actually remembered, my guy's name was Dinesh Al-Tubby.

880
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:13,463
Speaker 0: Why?

881
00:46:13,483 --> 00:46:14,340
Speaker 0: Because he's the fat guy.

882
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:17,500
Speaker 0: His name sounds like Danish and I made his last name Tubby on purpose.

883
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:18,284
Speaker 0: T-U-B-V-I.

884
00:46:18,727 --> 00:46:20,500
Speaker 0: Because he's the fat food taster.

885
00:46:21,161 --> 00:46:24,919
Speaker 0: But it's, you know, it's like, hey, I remember the other people's names kind of.

886
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:30,180
Speaker 1: Two, people get in character and start speaking in this first person way more than I see in other games.

887
00:46:30,420 --> 00:46:41,039
Speaker 1: And I think it's just these subtle mechanism design of these simple mechanics makes it very easy to fit into a character because, like Scott said, you're role-playing a bunch of people hanging out, telling stories.

888
00:46:42,842 --> 00:46:44,940
Speaker 1: You're role-playing yourselves, dog.

889
00:46:47,741 --> 00:46:55,220
Speaker 1: So McGrae Baker, if you want this game, you can actually just buy the PDF and/or the book at Night Sky Games.

890
00:46:55,360 --> 00:46:57,459
Speaker 1: Now you might notice there's other games listed here.

891
00:46:58,003 --> 00:47:06,140
Speaker 1: For example, right next to A Thousand and One Nights, I see Apocalypse World, Dogs in the Vineyard, In a Wicked Age.

892
00:47:08,381 --> 00:47:08,486
Speaker 1: Yeah.

893
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:11,955
Speaker 1: But anyway, I don't think we'll talk about this game again.

894
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:16,880
Speaker 1: We've kind of talked about it twice and there's nothing else I can say other than that.

895
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:18,511
Speaker 0: It's not that much of a game.

896
00:47:18,532 --> 00:47:19,620
Speaker 0: We already told you the whole thing.

897
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:28,240
Speaker 1: If you want to flex your role-playing chops, really, this game will probably make you a better storyteller and make you more comfortable being in the first person than any other game I've seen.

898
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:35,720
Speaker 0: It's also, right, doesn't have any sort-- I mean, there's very small amounts of conflict resolution when two people want the story to go a different way.

899
00:47:36,802 --> 00:47:37,729
Speaker 0: But really not so much.

900
00:47:37,749 --> 00:47:43,820
Speaker 0: It's one of the only role-playing games that doesn't really have so much conflict business, which is what most role-playing games are about.

901
00:47:44,181 --> 00:47:45,355
Speaker 0: They're about like, "I want to feed the

902
00:47:45,395 --> 00:47:45,739
Speaker 0: monster.".

903
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:46,895
Speaker 0: "No, we don't want you to feed the

904
00:47:46,916 --> 00:47:47,179
Speaker 0: monster.".

905
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:48,734
Speaker 0: "Rawr, roll a bunch of dice to see which way it

906
00:47:48,774 --> 00:47:48,976
Speaker 0: goes.".

907
00:47:49,461 --> 00:47:51,440
Speaker 0: It only has a very small amount of that.

908
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:58,623
Speaker 0: It's mostly just telling the story and the conflict is just sort of real conflict between "You

909
00:47:58,704 --> 00:47:59,107
Speaker 0: asshole.".

910
00:47:59,167 --> 00:47:59,429
Speaker 0: "No, you

911
00:47:59,530 --> 00:47:59,812
Speaker 0: asshole.".

912
00:48:06,735 --> 00:48:08,880
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

913
00:48:09,080 --> 00:48:14,000
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

914
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:19,400
Speaker 0: Be sure to visit our website at frontrowcrew.com for show notes, discussion news, and more.

915
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:22,340
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

916
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:27,039
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.

918
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:34,859
Speaker 0: Geek Nights is recorded live with no studio and no audience.

919
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:38,040
Speaker 0: But unlike those other late shows, it's actually recorded at night.
