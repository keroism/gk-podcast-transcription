00:00:29,422 --> 00:00:31,912
Speaker 1: So this morning it looked like it was gonna be a nice normal day.

8
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:35,042
Speaker 1: I woke up almost on time I Left.

9
00:00:35,504 --> 00:00:37,573
Speaker 1: I didn't stop at the coffee shop ride my bike with Emily.

10
00:00:37,593 --> 00:00:41,105
Speaker 1: We're gonna get to the train station and There's almost no traffic.

11
00:00:41,185 --> 00:00:42,752
Speaker 1: Everything's great the weather's perfect.

12
00:00:42,792 --> 00:00:43,535
Speaker 0: There's no traffic.

13
00:00:43,555 --> 00:00:44,680
Speaker 0: We're driving around town.

14
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:46,407
Speaker 0: We're not like getting on 84 or anything.

15
00:00:46,889 --> 00:00:49,800
Speaker 1: usually there's a lot of traffic in our way trying to bike to the train station.

16
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:52,554
Speaker 0: I never have traffic ever going to the train station.

17
00:00:52,615 --> 00:01:01,410
Speaker 1: well the traffic It's more along the lines of a lot of cars are going by and a lot of cars freak out when they see a bicycle And they swerve over the double yellow and almost cause accidents.

18
00:01:02,514 --> 00:01:02,735
Speaker 0: I don't.

19
00:01:02,855 --> 00:01:03,999
Speaker 0: I don't see people freaking out.

20
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:05,266
Speaker 0: I don't know what you do.

21
00:01:05,307 --> 00:01:09,159
Speaker 1: you ride your bike to the train station in the morning No, but I ride my car around bikes.

22
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:16,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz you normally in front of me and people behind me and they don't freak out much of the time when I'm riding my bike and I'm Like.

23
00:01:16,707 --> 00:01:27,460
Speaker 1: I'm not in the shoulder I'm in the lane at the far right like I'm supposed to be cars will like cross Bowl all four tires over the double yellow like to the other opposite side of the road and then drive past me.

24
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,680
Speaker 0: Well, they are they doing it in a freakout way like whoa or they just getting out of your way?

25
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:39,060
Speaker 1: Well, they're getting out of my way even though legally they shouldn't be over the double yellow And then the oncoming traffic is freaking out and swerving into the shoulder.

26
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:41,831
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just stay far to the left.

27
00:01:41,871 --> 00:01:43,317
Speaker 0: I don't go over the WL line.

28
00:01:43,337 --> 00:01:44,020
Speaker 0: I'm gonna hit a car.

29
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, what I'm saying is a lot of people just go all the way over the double yellow.

30
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:56,960
Speaker 0: And but the other thing is a lot of times You know, it's like I get stuck behind a bike person when the the lane is too narrow And you know what legally you got to stay behind that biker.

31
00:01:57,101 --> 00:02:04,818
Speaker 0: I do until I have an opening especially like if I can't see cars coming, you know It's like you know that big turn when you leave the train station of the route.

32
00:02:04,879 --> 00:02:06,860
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you can't see what's coming around that corner.

33
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,054
Speaker 0: If you go over that line even a little bit you can be dead.

34
00:02:09,476 --> 00:02:12,740
Speaker 1: The thing is though Remember, you're a generally smarter and have more.

35
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:17,100
Speaker 0: But I don't see the people in front of me or behind me in their cars doing anything different from what I'm doing.

36
00:02:17,361 --> 00:02:18,285
Speaker 1: Maybe because I'm biking.

37
00:02:18,366 --> 00:02:21,419
Speaker 1: I see the reaction of every car that passes me dealing with a bike.

38
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,747
Speaker 1: Sometimes people honk at me.

39
00:02:23,029 --> 00:02:24,780
Speaker 1: Sometimes people suddenly notice me and then swerve.

40
00:02:26,003 --> 00:02:29,862
Speaker 1: I don't notice that a lot of people honk a lot of people flip me off Uh-huh.

41
00:02:29,982 --> 00:02:30,605
Speaker 1: It's awesome.

42
00:02:30,946 --> 00:02:32,733
Speaker 1: Mostly on my way home more than my way to work.

43
00:02:33,034 --> 00:02:36,286
Speaker 1: But anyway come down the road There's a long awesome hill.

44
00:02:36,607 --> 00:02:39,458
Speaker 1: Well, it's awesome in the morning because I get to fly down repaved it.

45
00:02:39,498 --> 00:02:40,000
Speaker 0: It's very nice.

46
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,401
Speaker 0: I know

47
00:02:40,863 --> 00:02:45,719
Speaker 1: it was great for rollerblading now, but on the way home, it kind of sucks because it's really really steep

48
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:46,642
Speaker 0: Uh-huh,

49
00:02:47,144 --> 00:02:52,880
Speaker 1: but going down the hill and there's traffic completely stopped filling the entire hill all the way to the bottom

50
00:02:52,987 --> 00:03:01,120
Speaker 0: Yeah I basically I turned right in my car Onto this hill and I said, uh-oh and I turned around and I went the other train station entrance, which is just fine.

51
00:03:01,441 --> 00:03:13,240
Speaker 1: So some dumbass trucker with a super long truck I mean I'm talking longer than a long cat has backed into this driveway and now cannot get out but cannot back in any further.

52
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:21,680
Speaker 1: So he has stopped completely perpendicular to the flow of traffic 100% blocking the road in both directions with no possible way to get around.

53
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:22,486
Speaker 0: It's sort of a what.

54
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:27,420
Speaker 0: it's not technically a one-way road But you're not allowed to leave the train station onto that road.

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,440
Speaker 1: Actually, I've seen a lot of people leaving the train station onto that road.

56
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,988
Speaker 0: I've seen police pull people over.

57
00:03:32,068 --> 00:03:34,178
Speaker 0: I know even the train station where they're not supposed to.

58
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,100
Speaker 1: actually I saw the same guy do it three times.

59
00:03:36,201 --> 00:03:38,860
Speaker 1: So today I actually stopped because there was an MTA cop sitting there.

60
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:43,063
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I even the license plate in the make and I'm like this guy does this almost every day at this time Uh-huh.

61
00:03:43,385 --> 00:03:44,935
Speaker 1: So he said he'll be waiting for him tomorrow.

62
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:50,574
Speaker 0: All right but anyway the point is is that you're only allowed to go the other way on that road.

63
00:03:50,634 --> 00:03:56,065
Speaker 0: if you were say stopped at one of the Houses on the road or there's a business And there's a.

64
00:03:56,106 --> 00:04:04,223
Speaker 1: there's another business that this truck was going to and this dumbass truck is stuck And he's stuck to the point that there's a fence by on one side There's.

65
00:04:04,424 --> 00:04:09,720
Speaker 1: even the pedestrians really didn't have an easy path to get around this truck Yeah, because you had to climb over the fence.

66
00:04:10,042 --> 00:04:11,107
Speaker 1: I just kind of said screw it.

67
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:27,500
Speaker 1: and I just rode past the truck and made him stop for me Mm-hmm, but he was stuck and he couldn't get out and there's a lot of cars and people were getting out of the cars the passenger side and walk in and yelling at the guy and People are like trying to turn around but they couldn't because the cars behind him were too close.

68
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:32,580
Speaker 0: I turned around immediately and I wasn't that I just a whoop and I got out of there.

69
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:36,200
Speaker 1: But a lot of people ended up missing their train because of this dumbass truck.

70
00:04:36,703 --> 00:04:39,359
Speaker 0: The truck should have gotten a ticket for obstructing the road.

71
00:04:39,701 --> 00:04:42,960
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is I complained to the MTA police since I was talking to the guy anyway.

72
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:43,748
Speaker 0: Well, they're MTA police.

73
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:44,960
Speaker 0: They don't have jurisdiction over there.

74
00:04:45,004 --> 00:04:54,659
Speaker 1: No, no no but the thing is they took the complaint because he said a lot of people complained and Metro North take stuff like that seriously and they're gonna follow up with the local police and That business is gonna get in some trouble.

75
00:04:54,841 --> 00:04:58,496
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's pretty cool that the subways and the trains have their own police.

76
00:04:58,556 --> 00:04:59,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about that.

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,344
Speaker 1: That's how badass.

78
00:05:00,404 --> 00:05:03,796
Speaker 0: New York State downstairs separate police for the trains in the subways.

79
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:04,820
Speaker 0: I mean, they're real police.

80
00:05:04,922 --> 00:05:14,399
Speaker 0: It's not like they're fake police But they're the police that they just have jurisdiction on trains where normal police don't have jurisdiction and they don't mess around.

81
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:24,471
Speaker 1: plus the all the employees of the trains have the same rights as police officers in terms of if you assault them Minimum sentences and all that business.

82
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:39,832
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot of laws that protect Subway and train and bus employees, you know, because sometimes they have to go like if you're the bus driver Who has to drive in the shit town, you know, they make a law that says alright, don't fuck with the bus driver Yeah, which is fine.

83
00:05:40,195 --> 00:05:44,400
Speaker 1: Yep But yeah, I just that was the most interesting thing that happened to me today.

84
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,588
Speaker 1: Then I went to work and now I'm back home.

85
00:05:46,829 --> 00:05:47,190
Speaker 0: Me too.

86
00:05:47,752 --> 00:05:48,094
Speaker 0: Hooray.

87
00:05:48,154 --> 00:05:48,837
Speaker 0: Tomorrow's Friday.

88
00:05:49,298 --> 00:05:58,308
Speaker 1: It is You don't have to make a show, haha, however Friday night the first of the Visigoths are going to be surrounding This capital of geek house doesn't matter.

89
00:05:58,368 --> 00:06:02,762
Speaker 0: I'm gonna run away to Carthage and where pray tell is Carthage I don't know.

90
00:06:02,782 --> 00:06:06,514
Speaker 1: You're gonna lock yourself in the bathroom upstairs and just hope everyone goes away.

91
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:09,983
Speaker 0: Let's just pretend that my room is Carthage All right.

92
00:06:10,304 --> 00:06:14,160
Speaker 1: The thing is Carthage didn't really survive the Visigothic invasion.

93
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,630
Speaker 0: There's a Mediterranean Sea in the way.

94
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,394
Speaker 0: I can't hear you.

95
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:18,299
Speaker 0: You're a little far away.

96
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:22,310
Speaker 1: And then of course, we're playing D&D on Sunday.

97
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:28,257
Speaker 1: Yep, and some burning wheel on Saturday Yeah, and some drunken Horatio possibly on Saturday, but it's gonna be a good weekend.

98
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:31,579
Speaker 0: All right News do you have for this weekend?

99
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:36,979
Speaker 1: Well speaking of transit and New York City, this actually has nothing to do with that at all.

100
00:06:37,642 --> 00:06:42,463
Speaker 1: So in LA as you might know on the other side of the country You know, you know what?

101
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:47,680
Speaker 1: This reminds me of this segue was much like the way I remember stalactites versus stalagmites.

102
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,756
Speaker 1: Stalagmites Might hang from the ceiling, but they fucking don't know.

103
00:06:53,796 --> 00:06:54,860
Speaker 0: they don't anyway.

104
00:06:55,181 --> 00:07:00,920
Speaker 1: This is a mashup of Google Maps and the homicide statistics of Los Angeles County.

105
00:07:01,301 --> 00:07:05,560
Speaker 0: Oh, so this is a lot like that sex offender map plus Google Maps that I saw though

106
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:18,300
Speaker 1: I gotta say while a significant portion of sex offenders didn't actually do anything wrong and just you know peed in public or something We looked up every sex offender in our area and they were all like horrible rapists.

107
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,640
Speaker 0: They're all rapists or child molesters or other horrible things.

108
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:28,549
Speaker 0: I mean most of the people that are gotten by sex offender laws are sex offenders But we're not gonna talk about this.

109
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:30,978
Speaker 1: No, no, but this is the same kind of mashup.

110
00:07:31,138 --> 00:07:35,490
Speaker 1: only it's Murders in LA and you can break it down as all statistics.

111
00:07:35,510 --> 00:07:37,777
Speaker 1: You can look for man slaughters only.

112
00:07:37,797 --> 00:07:41,933
Speaker 1: Yeah You can look for the age the right incidents only.

113
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:44,584
Speaker 1: no just murders All right.

114
00:07:44,604 --> 00:07:44,965
Speaker 1: Here it is.

115
00:07:45,146 --> 00:07:49,200
Speaker 1: It has age categories ethnicity categories gender cause of death.

116
00:07:49,482 --> 00:07:54,967
Speaker 1: There are only four blunt force gunshot Stavin and other stab.

117
00:07:54,987 --> 00:07:57,053
Speaker 0: Well, it's that is it's a Stavin.

118
00:07:57,173 --> 00:07:58,056
Speaker 1: It's a stabbing.

119
00:07:58,477 --> 00:08:00,483
Speaker 1: Ah, I Like other does it?

120
00:08:00,503 --> 00:08:04,038
Speaker 0: does it separate it by like, you know, big knife little knife shiv.

121
00:08:04,058 --> 00:08:07,609
Speaker 1: No, no It's just blunt force gunshot stabbing other day of the week.

122
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,826
Speaker 1: and then they have two special categories killing by police and Suspected domestic incident.

123
00:08:14,107 --> 00:08:14,408
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

124
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:17,560
Speaker 1: And by clicking all these you can suspected domestic incident.

125
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:20,168
Speaker 0: So definitely a domestic incident doesn't count.

126
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:24,120
Speaker 1: Uh, I imagine that a definite one is also suspected of being one.

127
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:29,380
Speaker 1: I mean if you shoot a guy and I see you shoot him, I suspect that you shot him.

128
00:08:29,501 --> 00:08:36,234
Speaker 0: I also know I also know that you shot But it could have been Illusion you could have been seeing things.

129
00:08:36,355 --> 00:08:37,039
Speaker 1: Here's what I do.

130
00:08:37,201 --> 00:08:44,833
Speaker 0: That'd be crazy If you're like a magician and you find a way to do a magic trick to make it look like you killed someone in the Street and know what everyone's fooled but you didn't.

131
00:08:45,296 --> 00:08:51,120
Speaker 1: it's kind of like that The street magician who had the trick where he breaks the car window and then acts like he freaks out runs away.

132
00:08:51,501 --> 00:08:52,565
Speaker 0: Yeah, only that guy.

133
00:08:52,585 --> 00:08:53,849
Speaker 0: I think I actually broke a car window.

134
00:08:54,090 --> 00:08:54,491
Speaker 1: I don't know.

135
00:08:54,512 --> 00:08:56,860
Speaker 1: I really think it was staged either way.

136
00:08:57,382 --> 00:08:57,764
Speaker 0: Go on.

137
00:08:57,784 --> 00:09:00,820
Speaker 1: All right, so I've learned two things from this one.

138
00:09:01,363 --> 00:09:04,280
Speaker 1: There are a few places in LA that are really fucking dangerous.

139
00:09:05,242 --> 00:09:07,157
Speaker 0: uh-huh, so don't go to those places and to.

140
00:09:08,801 --> 00:09:16,404
Speaker 1: if you were between the ages of 20 and 29 are Hispanic or black are a man and It's a Sunday.

141
00:09:16,947 --> 00:09:18,272
Speaker 1: watch the fuck out.

142
00:09:18,754 --> 00:09:20,200
Speaker 0: But why did they get killed on Sunday?

143
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:22,488
Speaker 1: There's more murders on Sunday than any other day.

144
00:09:22,508 --> 00:09:25,660
Speaker 0: So just Sunday stay at home watch football.

145
00:09:26,203 --> 00:09:27,651
Speaker 0: Maybe the football has something to do with it.

146
00:09:27,892 --> 00:09:28,254
Speaker 1: I don't know.

147
00:09:28,314 --> 00:09:31,348
Speaker 0: It's like that, you know the Was it the LA?

148
00:09:31,930 --> 00:09:36,807
Speaker 0: let's see San Francisco 49ers LA Raiders the Raiders.

149
00:09:36,827 --> 00:09:39,114
Speaker 0: I think it's the Oakland Raiders now though.

150
00:09:39,715 --> 00:09:40,137
Speaker 0: I don't know.

151
00:09:40,337 --> 00:09:41,039
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

152
00:09:41,661 --> 00:09:44,271
Speaker 0: The California football team's not so good.

153
00:09:44,552 --> 00:09:45,696
Speaker 0: people get pissed when they lose.

154
00:09:45,736 --> 00:09:46,800
Speaker 0: maybe who knows?

155
00:09:47,021 --> 00:09:49,055
Speaker 1: Well, it might also have to do with paydays or something.

156
00:09:49,095 --> 00:09:49,438
Speaker 1: I don't know.

157
00:09:50,342 --> 00:09:53,392
Speaker 1: Maybe there's blue laws out there and man can't get his man juice.

158
00:09:53,412 --> 00:09:55,418
Speaker 0: I know California has the blue laws.

159
00:09:55,459 --> 00:09:55,840
Speaker 0: That's true.

160
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:56,524
Speaker 0: That's true.

161
00:09:56,605 --> 00:09:57,350
Speaker 1: You never know.

162
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:58,720
Speaker 1: because New York has some blue law.

163
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:03,080
Speaker 0: That's because we're in the Northeast but New York is New York, but those laws are old.

164
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,277
Speaker 0: California is new.

165
00:10:05,761 --> 00:10:18,660
Speaker 1: I didn't find it hilarious when Dave from Dave and Joel's fast karate for the gentleman was spending time in New York City and was Amazed at the fact that pretty much 24/7 you can buy a beer just about anywhere.

166
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:25,243
Speaker 1: In fact, you can buy a beer at the train station from a guy who will sell it to you right before you get on The train.

167
00:10:25,303 --> 00:10:28,180
Speaker 0: well, you're on a train the trains that go to Connecticut.

168
00:10:28,341 --> 00:10:31,290
Speaker 0: Some of them have a bar car where you can buy beer on the train.

169
00:10:31,311 --> 00:10:33,337
Speaker 1: I love New York, right?

170
00:10:33,678 --> 00:10:38,836
Speaker 1: But anyway There are similar statistics now that a lot of people are able to put this data together.

171
00:10:38,876 --> 00:10:54,240
Speaker 1: There's an unrelated story I'm not gonna bother linking to it about how police officers are looking at data like this and determining Areas where crimes are likely to happen at certain times and they're just putting cops there and crime rates are going down pretty significantly.

172
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,851
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's not like the crime is gonna move elsewhere like.

173
00:10:57,911 --> 00:11:05,239
Speaker 0: I forget what city it was but they noticed that the majority I'm not gonna kill you over here Let's go to that place this low crime and no cops and I'll kill you over there.

174
00:11:05,461 --> 00:11:13,520
Speaker 1: The majority of stabbings occurred outside of check cashing places on paydays in poor neighborhoods.

175
00:11:13,801 --> 00:11:19,020
Speaker 0: That reminds me when I was one time I was leaving Shea Stadium and I saw the funniest thing ever.

176
00:11:19,443 --> 00:11:24,340
Speaker 0: There was a you know next to Shea Stadium There's like an area where there's a whole bunch of like Korean auto shops.

177
00:11:24,902 --> 00:11:32,139
Speaker 0: But if you go down the street a bit, there's another area and I saw in one sort of like You know shopping building of some sorts.

178
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:48,680
Speaker 0: There was a check cashing place and the same structure directly adjacent was a liquor store And it was a stool in between the stores and on that stool was a homeless man I guess he begs for money from people who just cashed their paycheck and buys liquor with it.

179
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,277
Speaker 0: He's like not even fooling anybody, you know, and he sits in the prime position much like the Silk Road.

180
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:59,899
Speaker 0: that guy That guy indeed.

181
00:12:00,801 --> 00:12:11,519
Speaker 1: Anyway, I find things like this fast Marco Polo of Queens and I wish there were some sort of national database of crimes that I could Then look at in a system like this because I think that would be really cool.

182
00:12:11,901 --> 00:12:18,460
Speaker 0: How about a cell phone application that says hey go this way to avoid the cry or you're entering a high crime area.

183
00:12:19,744 --> 00:12:25,439
Speaker 1: You know stuff like that, you know, I just realized suddenly This is the exact opposite of that.

184
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:30,694
Speaker 1: what if we made a little application for cell phones or PDAs or Wi-Fi businesses?

185
00:12:31,035 --> 00:12:35,247
Speaker 1: or maybe if we even sold a gadget and you Know those services where it'll like.

186
00:12:35,608 --> 00:12:42,253
Speaker 1: beep if there's a gay guy nearby with the same thing or beep if there's a guy into S&M Nearby into the same things you are and your dating services.

187
00:12:42,474 --> 00:12:43,499
Speaker 1: There's a lot of things like that.

188
00:12:44,001 --> 00:12:50,080
Speaker 1: What if you made one that allows you to specify yourself as a weed seeker or weed seller?

189
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sure they have those.

190
00:12:51,914 --> 00:12:54,687
Speaker 0: it's called Pre-pay cell phones.

191
00:12:55,310 --> 00:12:55,511
Speaker 1: Yeah.

192
00:12:56,053 --> 00:12:57,420
Speaker 1: No, I mean what if it was automatic?

193
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,588
Speaker 1: Just you know your Nintendo DS.

194
00:12:59,608 --> 00:13:05,283
Speaker 1: you sell a bootleg cartridge and the DS goes Whatever.

195
00:13:05,323 --> 00:13:07,251
Speaker 1: a guy's got weed near you and you can just buy some.

196
00:13:07,632 --> 00:13:09,500
Speaker 1: it's a lot safer than the shoe method or all.

197
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:17,505
Speaker 0: or So a cop goes on the internet and buys one and walks down the street and says he got weed he got weed Yeah, and you know what?

198
00:13:17,565 --> 00:13:19,210
Speaker 1: There's some plausible deniability there.

199
00:13:19,631 --> 00:13:22,300
Speaker 1: and two you can always say are you a police officer?

200
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,545
Speaker 1: Uh-huh, or you make it really secret.

201
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:26,854
Speaker 1: you ask people when they buy him if they're a police officer.

202
00:13:27,356 --> 00:13:27,838
Speaker 0: Are you done?

203
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,062
Speaker 1: I'm done All right.

204
00:13:29,363 --> 00:13:30,527
Speaker 1: I was I could keep going.

205
00:13:30,728 --> 00:13:33,678
Speaker 0: So there's been something that's been pissing me off lately.

206
00:13:33,698 --> 00:13:39,400
Speaker 0: Oh Fancy that actually I think I've complained about on the show before but now I'm gonna super complain about it.

207
00:13:40,302 --> 00:13:45,438
Speaker 0: So there was a flight an airplane on July 29th, and it was flying.

208
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:49,972
Speaker 0: Oh From Caracas, Venezuela to Newark.

209
00:13:50,192 --> 00:13:50,895
Speaker 0: I've been to Newark.

210
00:13:50,975 --> 00:13:58,055
Speaker 0: It's it's in New Jersey, right and Bad weather caused the plane to be diverted to be more.

211
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:08,440
Speaker 0: Ah It sat there For about five hours with passengers on board as food and water ran low and toilets became filthy.

212
00:14:09,024 --> 00:14:09,809
Speaker 1: Now that wasn't it?

213
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:11,360
Speaker 1: not just filthy but overflowing?

214
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,644
Speaker 0: I don't know.

215
00:14:12,744 --> 00:14:24,763
Speaker 0: It's kind of hard to say exactly what this particular situation was because different statements by different people give varying Situation reports.

216
00:14:24,944 --> 00:14:30,620
Speaker 0: it could be anywhere from there was everything was just fine - it was the worst thing ever.

217
00:14:31,142 --> 00:14:36,420
Speaker 0: The thing I want to point out is that the people on this plane unlike other planes, which I don't respect.

218
00:14:36,581 --> 00:14:46,249
Speaker 0: I respect this plane from Caracas because after a while the people's they got rowdy and they started clapping in unison and banging on the overhead containers in you

219
00:14:46,269 --> 00:14:46,910
Speaker 1: all right and

220
00:14:48,902 --> 00:15:00,432
Speaker 0: I guess what happened though was pretty stupid and that the I guess the one of the stewardesses was a bitch of some sort and She must have called the police and was like people are getting violent and rowdy.

221
00:15:00,452 --> 00:15:04,620
Speaker 0: and since it was like an international flight You know, they didn't let him into customs or anything.

222
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:11,119
Speaker 0: They just sort of took him off the plane and treated him like criminals and they you know We're calling the people names and treating them like shit.

223
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:27,080
Speaker 1: All I have to say to that is because because this sort of thing happens a lot and I don't know if many of you Fly a lot in the US and it doesn't happen all the time and not especially to business travelers But more often than it should airlines totally fuck people and don't help them out in any way.

224
00:15:27,269 --> 00:15:41,301
Speaker 0: Yes But the point I want to make here is specifically When the problem with a plane is that like like for example today that truck was blocking the road The bus that was stopped there was a bus that couldn't get around the truck a bus that was supposed to go to the train Station.

225
00:15:41,682 --> 00:15:49,168
Speaker 0: the bus just let everyone off at the top of the road and everyone walked down to the train station who wanted to Right big deal an airplane.

226
00:15:49,268 --> 00:15:50,332
Speaker 0: It doesn't work like that.

227
00:15:50,593 --> 00:15:52,520
Speaker 0: They don't let people off airplanes.

228
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:55,880
Speaker 0: You just have to stay on until you get to the gate and they let you depart.

229
00:15:56,121 --> 00:16:00,575
Speaker 0: You know properly and you can only get on the airplane when they tell you to and it's.

230
00:16:00,775 --> 00:16:04,290
Speaker 0: it's very controlled You know, you can't just get off the plane.

231
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:07,364
Speaker 0: if it's you know on the ground or whatever You can only do it.

232
00:16:07,384 --> 00:16:11,640
Speaker 0: You're basically trapped and at the mercy of the people who decide where the plane goes.

233
00:16:12,542 --> 00:16:14,432
Speaker 0: I think that's pretty much true in all countries though.

234
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:15,517
Speaker 0: It's not like a US thing.

235
00:16:15,618 --> 00:16:20,700
Speaker 0: However There's been a problem and a lot of stories at least a lot of stories on the internet.

236
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,147
Speaker 0: I don't know how often it actually happens.

237
00:16:22,187 --> 00:16:24,820
Speaker 0: where a plane it's happened to me as it happened to you.

238
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,059
Speaker 0: You know you realize that maybe never happened to me.

239
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:28,344
Speaker 1: Maybe it's just bad luck.

240
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:33,340
Speaker 1: But the last time I flew without incident was when I was in high school.

241
00:16:33,461 --> 00:16:37,325
Speaker 0: I've never flown without incident I mean I've never flown with incident.

242
00:16:37,565 --> 00:16:43,080
Speaker 1: every time I have flown or attempted to fly since I graduated high school has ended an absolute disaster.

243
00:16:43,441 --> 00:16:53,135
Speaker 0: Anyway, there's a lot of situations where a plane leaves the gate Which means now you can't get off and it sits outside on the ground mind you?

244
00:16:53,175 --> 00:17:00,240
Speaker 0: not in the sky on the ground Not moving for a very long time hours and hours and hours on end, right?

245
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,280
Speaker 0: And the thing I don't understand about this is okay.

246
00:17:03,802 --> 00:17:08,760
Speaker 0: If a plane isn't ready to take off right now, like I can the runway is free.

247
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,262
Speaker 0: I'm going.

248
00:17:09,281 --> 00:17:10,970
Speaker 0: don't leave the fucking gate.

249
00:17:11,372 --> 00:17:12,858
Speaker 0: Don't leave don't close the door.

250
00:17:13,944 --> 00:17:17,099
Speaker 1: The reason is because they want to use that gate for other things.

251
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:18,440
Speaker 1: They want to get that plane out of the way.

252
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,160
Speaker 0: I've never been to an airport where every gate has been in use.

253
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:25,859
Speaker 0: There are always not aliens and plenty and plenty and plenty of extra gates that are not in you.

254
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,529
Speaker 1: Not all planes can go to all gates.

255
00:17:27,851 --> 00:17:29,500
Speaker 1: Not all airlines can use all gates.

256
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,620
Speaker 1: There's all sorts of reasons for that's a bunch of bullshit.

257
00:17:31,741 --> 00:17:35,097
Speaker 0: If they have a bunch of gates any plane that needs to should be able to use any gate.

258
00:17:35,358 --> 00:17:38,751
Speaker 0: fuck them The any gate that it'll work with.

259
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,420
Speaker 1: you can't really manage there also.

260
00:17:41,461 --> 00:17:44,211
Speaker 1: Well, I agree that generally that situation is crap.

261
00:17:44,452 --> 00:17:45,838
Speaker 1: Your solution doesn't work perfectly.

262
00:17:45,958 --> 00:17:52,497
Speaker 0: also If there's no gate You can still you wheel up the stairs next to the plane and people walk down the stairs onto the ground.

263
00:17:52,517 --> 00:17:54,143
Speaker 1: the rationale is That is dangerous.

264
00:17:54,906 --> 00:17:57,554
Speaker 0: Oh, no, they let me do it in Florida all the time.

265
00:17:57,735 --> 00:18:01,366
Speaker 0: You can always board right onto the Disembark right onto the ground.

266
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:09,739
Speaker 1: Well, it depends on where you are and where the plane is and there's only Areas they can wait can taxi over to a designated area, but you're forgetting the primary thing.

267
00:18:10,382 --> 00:18:14,800
Speaker 1: Anything that would help the customer in that situation would cost the airline more money.

268
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:20,440
Speaker 0: Pilot has to sit on the plane for a zillion hours - yeah, so does all the crew and everyone.

269
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:21,806
Speaker 0: Yeah, it sucks what.

270
00:18:21,846 --> 00:18:22,830
Speaker 0: they don't want to sit there.

271
00:18:23,132 --> 00:18:23,795
Speaker 0: They should fuck it.

272
00:18:23,835 --> 00:18:24,940
Speaker 0: Why don't they fucking complain?

273
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:32,981
Speaker 0: No one should ever be forced to sit out on an airplane Not going anywhere for more than like 30 minutes ever Scott The.

274
00:18:33,081 --> 00:18:38,683
Speaker 1: the reason it is this way is that no one cares enough except the people who get fucked by it and they have no Power at all.

275
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:40,491
Speaker 1: What do you what are you going to?

276
00:18:40,531 --> 00:18:40,612
Speaker 1: do?

277
00:18:40,732 --> 00:18:42,300
Speaker 1: not fly if you raise a ruckus?

278
00:18:42,340 --> 00:18:42,962
Speaker 1: They arrest you.

279
00:18:43,304 --> 00:18:53,672
Speaker 0: if somebody if I was stuck on a plane for more than like an hour I would literally get everyone on the plane into a mob Force the crew to let us open the door and leave.

280
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:54,917
Speaker 0: I wouldn't be violent or hurt.

281
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:59,413
Speaker 1: anyone got it wouldn't matter They unless you were I'll use the emergency chutes and get off the plane.

282
00:18:59,433 --> 00:18:59,975
Speaker 1: That's illegal.

283
00:18:59,995 --> 00:19:00,798
Speaker 1: You'd all be arrested.

284
00:19:00,838 --> 00:19:02,952
Speaker 0: That's fine It's civil disobedience.

285
00:19:02,993 --> 00:19:03,860
Speaker 0: I'd want to go to jail.

286
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:05,687
Speaker 0: It's better than being stuck on a goddamn plane.

287
00:19:05,928 --> 00:19:08,660
Speaker 1: the civil disobedience wouldn't work because no one cares.

288
00:19:09,242 --> 00:19:10,186
Speaker 1: You just go to jail.

289
00:19:10,507 --> 00:19:17,494
Speaker 1: everyone else would fry get off free they target use the instigator and Then everyone else will go about their business and no one would care that you were in jail.

290
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:18,840
Speaker 0: That's not the point.

291
00:19:19,182 --> 00:19:20,730
Speaker 1: Oh, I know I agree with you.

292
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,760
Speaker 0: That's how civil that's so civil disobedience work.

293
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,619
Speaker 1: I'm just pointing out the civil disobedience only works if a lot of other people do it with you.

294
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:29,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, and no one else cares enough sadly.

295
00:19:29,970 --> 00:19:31,013
Speaker 0: That's tough.

296
00:19:31,033 --> 00:19:31,414
Speaker 0: You got it.

297
00:19:31,475 --> 00:19:31,836
Speaker 0: I got it.

298
00:19:31,856 --> 00:19:33,240
Speaker 0: You get you get the blood boiling.

299
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:34,144
Speaker 1: But anyway, I'm not gonna.

300
00:19:34,184 --> 00:19:34,968
Speaker 1: it's not gonna have it.

301
00:19:34,988 --> 00:19:35,772
Speaker 1: I'm just I'm.

302
00:19:36,093 --> 00:19:45,644
Speaker 0: the point is is Basically I say that if these planes if you have a plane and it's not going anywhere and the people want to get off And you don't let them off.

303
00:19:46,086 --> 00:19:49,160
Speaker 0: I say that's illegally detaining people and they should go to jail.

304
00:19:49,260 --> 00:19:53,480
Speaker 0: You can't just hold people there if they don't want to be there and there's no reason you can't bring them back.

305
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,704
Speaker 1: FA regulations let them do that.

306
00:19:55,945 --> 00:20:01,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, the FA regulations are bullshit and they're basically in contradiction with the with civil rights.

307
00:20:01,883 --> 00:20:05,397
Speaker 1: The thing is also you agree to all of that when you buy the ticket.

308
00:20:05,437 --> 00:20:07,004
Speaker 1: if you don't agree with that You don't have to fly.

309
00:20:07,064 --> 00:20:07,849
Speaker 1: flying is not a right.

310
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:08,774
Speaker 0: I know it's notice.

311
00:20:08,794 --> 00:20:09,900
Speaker 0: I haven't been flying lately.

312
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,161
Speaker 0: There's.

313
00:20:10,181 --> 00:20:14,520
Speaker 1: that's why I never fly and that's probably the only thing is right FA regulations.

314
00:20:15,022 --> 00:20:17,310
Speaker 0: These people flew from Caracas.

315
00:20:17,852 --> 00:20:20,947
Speaker 0: They don't have any FA in Caracas Yeah, but they're in the US.

316
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:25,820
Speaker 1: agree to that shit when they were in Caracas Actually, they probably did because they bought a ticket that went to America.

317
00:20:26,241 --> 00:20:27,245
Speaker 1: So they had to buy a ticket.

318
00:20:27,285 --> 00:20:30,156
Speaker 1: that ends up being I'll take it this legitimate next time.

319
00:20:30,176 --> 00:20:38,360
Speaker 0: next time I do fly I'm gonna look and I'm gonna see if it says you agree to Be stuck on the tarmac or go wherever the plane goes no matter what, you know and such.

320
00:20:38,784 --> 00:20:40,138
Speaker 0: I don't think it says that on there.

321
00:20:40,901 --> 00:20:42,539
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is is BS.

322
00:20:43,203 --> 00:20:48,849
Speaker 0: It has to stop and if people need to start, you know if you no one wants to sit on a plane like this.

323
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:52,822
Speaker 0: if you're stuck on a plane like this you have to get rowdy and Freaking.

324
00:20:53,103 --> 00:20:56,540
Speaker 0: make sure that airlines know that people aren't gonna stand for this anymore.

325
00:20:56,821 --> 00:21:00,100
Speaker 1: It would only work if everyone did it and not I think everyone's got to start doing it.

326
00:21:00,902 --> 00:21:03,709
Speaker 1: Because remember most people don't care.

327
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,935
Speaker 1: people just think that this would all.

328
00:21:05,955 --> 00:21:07,860
Speaker 0: I think people care that you don't want to sit on.

329
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:08,846
Speaker 0: the Place got ours.

330
00:21:08,906 --> 00:21:10,597
Speaker 0: The thing is I think there's wusses.

331
00:21:10,657 --> 00:21:12,580
Speaker 0: they care They're just also wusses Scott.

332
00:21:12,901 --> 00:21:18,303
Speaker 1: You realize that most people as far as they're concerned have to fly and get where they're going So they just do.

333
00:21:18,665 --> 00:21:23,000
Speaker 1: this would all be solved if people who disagreed with how airlines were run just didn't fly.

334
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:25,028
Speaker 1: The thing is people fly.

335
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:27,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, the problem is it's a monopoly.

336
00:21:27,944 --> 00:21:28,298
Speaker 0: There's no.

337
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,327
Speaker 0: Every stoop is not like an.

338
00:21:30,467 --> 00:21:38,780
Speaker 0: if there was an airline that say didn't have this stupid policy and would bring you back to the Gate I could do that airline instead, but it's not a monopoly because there's a lot of competing airline.

339
00:21:38,881 --> 00:21:39,405
Speaker 0: No, it's.

340
00:21:39,587 --> 00:21:41,040
Speaker 0: it's not a monopoly like that.

341
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:50,480
Speaker 0: but the point is is that all of the airlines have the same bullshit rules and There's no alternative to flying to get places in an efficient manner.

342
00:21:50,743 --> 00:21:54,600
Speaker 0: You know, like, you know It's not like I can take the train and get to Florida in a day.

343
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,027
Speaker 0: The train takes two days Scott.

344
00:21:56,268 --> 00:21:57,816
Speaker 1: all the grocery stores have the same rules.

345
00:21:57,836 --> 00:22:00,186
Speaker 1: You can't walk in naked You can't walk in without shoes on.

346
00:22:00,307 --> 00:22:03,240
Speaker 0: those are rules of the whole world there the country.

347
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,770
Speaker 1: But the thing is I don't have a choice.

348
00:22:05,931 --> 00:22:06,272
Speaker 1: I can't.

349
00:22:06,714 --> 00:22:07,839
Speaker 1: I mean it's not a monopoly.

350
00:22:07,899 --> 00:22:11,172
Speaker 0: but yet I can't change when you don't have a choice and you should have a choice.

351
00:22:11,734 --> 00:22:13,160
Speaker 0: The only solution is to get rowdy.

352
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:16,430
Speaker 1: Well, I just don't think it's gonna happen because most people don't.

353
00:22:16,450 --> 00:22:17,353
Speaker 0: it happened right here.

354
00:22:17,373 --> 00:22:19,500
Speaker 1: I am exercise New York Times.

355
00:22:19,922 --> 00:22:20,865
Speaker 1: I'm yeah, and I don't.

356
00:22:20,885 --> 00:22:22,030
Speaker 1: I think no one's gonna care.

357
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,440
Speaker 1: I'm just being realistic about this.

358
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:26,379
Speaker 1: Most people don't care about much at all.

359
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:29,132
Speaker 0: I think people care about being stuck on a plane for ten hours.

360
00:22:29,213 --> 00:22:30,820
Speaker 1: Most people never get stuck on a plane.

361
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:34,148
Speaker 1: Yeah, hey, most people don't even fly.

362
00:22:34,168 --> 00:22:36,316
Speaker 0: I think people who get stuck on planes.

363
00:22:36,396 --> 00:22:37,380
Speaker 0: None of them want to be there.

364
00:22:37,662 --> 00:22:39,540
Speaker 1: I took a much more practical solution.

365
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:44,463
Speaker 1: I just vote with my dollars and I don't fly and if I have to go somewhere to fly I have to fly to Get somewhere.

366
00:22:44,483 --> 00:22:47,260
Speaker 1: I'm either going to take all of those factors into account.

367
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:51,160
Speaker 1: I mean very few things are going to convince me to get on an airplane these days.

368
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,552
Speaker 0: I'll only get in an airplane when there is basically it.

369
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:56,700
Speaker 0: There's no other way like I have to go to London.

370
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:59,008
Speaker 0: Well, I'm not gonna take the slow boat.

371
00:22:59,409 --> 00:23:02,460
Speaker 1: I would seriously consider road tripping two packs instead of flying.

372
00:23:02,662 --> 00:23:07,180
Speaker 1: I would seriously consider plus that be kind of fun Especially if we got all our friends to go took a week and a half.

373
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:10,512
Speaker 0: The only reason I wouldn't is because I don't have enough vacation days to do so.

374
00:23:10,753 --> 00:23:11,436
Speaker 1: actually I do.

375
00:23:11,496 --> 00:23:13,887
Speaker 1: I realized that despite Otakon in the week of awesome and everything.

376
00:23:13,907 --> 00:23:15,093
Speaker 1: I have another two weeks this year.

377
00:23:15,113 --> 00:23:17,124
Speaker 0: I'll go use them I'm gonna.

378
00:23:17,828 --> 00:23:20,100
Speaker 0: but yeah, not enough vacation days.

379
00:23:20,764 --> 00:23:23,600
Speaker 1: Oh, well, I also have like two months worth of long-term disability.

380
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,493
Speaker 1: I got to come up with a way to use my long-term disability.

381
00:23:27,633 --> 00:23:28,135
Speaker 0: Basically.

382
00:23:28,155 --> 00:23:29,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, I got a baseball bat with your name.

383
00:23:29,761 --> 00:23:30,605
Speaker 1: I don't get sick days.

384
00:23:30,666 --> 00:23:32,174
Speaker 1: I get choice time days.

385
00:23:32,214 --> 00:23:34,240
Speaker 1: I can use for whatever I want I get a month's worth of them.

386
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:38,060
Speaker 0: I get infinity sick days and like a number of personal days plus holidays.

387
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:43,860
Speaker 1: But I get long-term disability and I accrue it continuously and of course all my things roll over forever.

388
00:23:43,921 --> 00:23:45,196
Speaker 1: There's no limit how many I can have.

389
00:23:46,001 --> 00:23:54,366
Speaker 1: But if I'm out for more than five days due to illness then I don't lose vacation days I lose long-term disability days instead.

390
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:56,231
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

391
00:23:56,251 --> 00:23:59,760
Speaker 0: So yeah, so I'll just break your leg or something.

392
00:24:00,243 --> 00:24:02,319
Speaker 1: Broken leg really wouldn't be an excuse to not go to work.

393
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:03,503
Speaker 0: Concussion.

394
00:24:04,064 --> 00:24:07,934
Speaker 1: How about vague pain based diarrhea illness?

395
00:24:08,035 --> 00:24:09,478
Speaker 1: Oh, no, I'm gonna be out for a week.

396
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:18,609
Speaker 1: Sorry Shady note from a doctor Everybody It's doctor In flammable means in flammable water country.

397
00:24:18,830 --> 00:24:20,033
Speaker 0: Yes, that's bullshit.

398
00:24:20,053 --> 00:24:25,640
Speaker 1: when they hold you on a plane while it is I think your idealism is a little bit misguided and wall.

399
00:24:26,142 --> 00:24:29,413
Speaker 1: I agree with all of your sentiment as a practical man.

400
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:31,340
Speaker 1: I don't think enough people give a shit.

401
00:24:31,521 --> 00:24:32,465
Speaker 0: You just sit on the plane.

402
00:24:32,485 --> 00:24:33,068
Speaker 0: What would you do?

403
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:35,340
Speaker 1: What I would do is not fucking fly.

404
00:24:36,122 --> 00:24:37,006
Speaker 0: You're already on the plane.

405
00:24:37,046 --> 00:24:37,688
Speaker 0: It's already stuck.

406
00:24:37,748 --> 00:24:37,869
Speaker 0: Now.

407
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:38,350
Speaker 0: What do you do?

408
00:24:39,013 --> 00:24:42,647
Speaker 0: Well, if I've been there for five hours You want to get the exact scenario?

409
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:43,732
Speaker 1: Here's what I would do.

410
00:24:43,752 --> 00:25:08,040
Speaker 1: I would very diplomatically gauge the mood and possibility of joining me of everyone else on the plane and if I could determine that Not not just a majority but a plurality of the people on the plane would rise up with me Then I would set up a situation whereby everyone rose up and yet no one would be able to point to me as being the instigator.

411
00:25:08,504 --> 00:25:10,220
Speaker 1: That way I could just be part of the crowd.

412
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:15,340
Speaker 1: I probably wouldn't be singled out in any prosecution that followed and I could still have all the media impact.

413
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:16,724
Speaker 1: That is what I would do.

414
00:25:16,744 --> 00:25:26,774
Speaker 0: Yeah, even so the end result is if they don't let you off the plane or taxi you back Somehow someone opens the hatch and you'll go down the emergency chute.

415
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:31,588
Speaker 1: I would also outside Regardless just sue the airline in civil court.

416
00:25:31,628 --> 00:25:32,310
Speaker 1: I come up with some.

417
00:25:32,391 --> 00:25:35,323
Speaker 0: I would definitely sue the air airline and at least small claims Court.

418
00:25:35,383 --> 00:25:36,640
Speaker 0: I'd get a lawyer like immediately.

419
00:25:36,721 --> 00:25:38,900
Speaker 1: The thing is I have a lawyer so it'd be free for me to sue.

420
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,628
Speaker 1: I just have to take the time off work to deal with.

421
00:25:40,668 --> 00:25:43,040
Speaker 0: there would definitely be some suing going on no matter what.

422
00:25:43,501 --> 00:25:53,920
Speaker 0: Plus, you know what you could do is you could set them up to where the damages are very high Unbeknownst to them like if I was of going on a trip to make like a two billion dollar business deal or something.

423
00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:56,854
Speaker 1: I think is you can't sue for things like that.

424
00:25:56,874 --> 00:26:01,635
Speaker 1: Oh, come on All that stuff is covered in the thing the contract you agree to.

425
00:26:01,656 --> 00:26:07,880
Speaker 1: when you buy a plane ticket You basically say I agree to the possibility that I will not fly anywhere.

426
00:26:07,961 --> 00:26:08,668
Speaker 1: What about this?

427
00:26:08,689 --> 00:26:09,356
Speaker 0: What about this?

428
00:26:09,396 --> 00:26:09,740
Speaker 0: You're ready?

429
00:26:10,241 --> 00:26:17,775
Speaker 0: I have diabetes and they didn't let me take my needles on the plane cuz they're not allowed And I've been stuck on the plane for too long.

430
00:26:17,795 --> 00:26:22,280
Speaker 1: if you have diabetes There's rules where if you fill out the proper forms, you are allowed to bring them on the plane.

431
00:26:22,501 --> 00:26:23,946
Speaker 0: Ah, there's got to be a catch.

432
00:26:23,967 --> 00:26:25,171
Speaker 0: There's got to be a way to fuck them.

433
00:26:25,492 --> 00:26:31,517
Speaker 1: There are no way you it would have to be so premeditated and There's got to be a way.

434
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:39,488
Speaker 1: Things of the day.

435
00:26:39,910 --> 00:26:41,015
Speaker 1: I'll be real quick about this.

436
00:26:41,035 --> 00:26:41,940
Speaker 1: This is an old video.

437
00:26:42,502 --> 00:26:42,823
Speaker 1: I have it.

438
00:26:42,923 --> 00:27:07,120
Speaker 1: In fact, I have this original video in my collection of fucked up videos from way back in the day But I saw it on the internet and I remembered it and all I want to point out is that this kind of prank I like because one it proves to you whether or not your friend whoever you were pulling this prank on is Able to deal with a dangerous and stressful situation in a calm and collected manner or not.

439
00:27:07,741 --> 00:27:08,042
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

440
00:27:08,664 --> 00:27:12,176
Speaker 1: The only problem with the prank is you're a gigantic asshole.

441
00:27:12,436 --> 00:27:13,959
Speaker 1: if you actually attempt it Why?

442
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:22,879
Speaker 1: Well because if you do it the person who is the prank II Might react in a way that is dangerous to you or others.

443
00:27:23,647 --> 00:27:24,679
Speaker 0: I guess that might be true.

444
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:37,125
Speaker 1: the prank is basically a guy is filled in with a light switch something and he acts like he's being shocked and he plays some electric shocking sounds and The guys standing there Freaks the fuck out.

445
00:27:37,366 --> 00:27:41,839
Speaker 0: I would have just you know body checked you off of the light switch as is supposed to be.

446
00:27:42,341 --> 00:27:43,387
Speaker 1: Well, actually I'm right.

447
00:27:43,407 --> 00:27:45,640
Speaker 1: I used to help other people with that stuff.

448
00:27:45,942 --> 00:27:50,850
Speaker 1: They always kept an aura around and if someone was shocked You're supposed to use the aura to hit him off of the lab.

449
00:27:50,931 --> 00:27:52,699
Speaker 0: if I had an or I would have hit you.

450
00:27:53,362 --> 00:27:54,727
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a bunch of things you can.

451
00:27:54,747 --> 00:27:56,835
Speaker 0: the thing is you basically wouldn't that suck?

452
00:27:56,855 --> 00:27:58,240
Speaker 0: you pull a prank to get hit.

453
00:27:58,481 --> 00:28:00,691
Speaker 0: So you get you the prank er gets hit.

454
00:28:01,494 --> 00:28:02,258
Speaker 0: It's kind of dumb.

455
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,659
Speaker 1: Yeah There's a lot of pranks like that.

456
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:08,099
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean imagine if you're trying to fool me into freaking out and I end up hitting you.

457
00:28:08,737 --> 00:28:28,212
Speaker 1: Oh It's like that famous video of there's this cool black guy and he's walking up to do a trick-or-treat in the house And oh, yeah, and there's a scarecrow and it's sitting there but the scarecrow is actually a dude and The scarecrow suddenly jumps up would order and the black guy must have been a boxer Because he perfectly just punches the guy in the face immediately

458
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:29,497
Speaker 0: and then he's like, oh shit, dude.

459
00:28:29,557 --> 00:28:29,898
Speaker 1: Oh shit.

460
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:30,460
Speaker 1: Are you okay?

461
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:34,506
Speaker 1: Man but the hit was solid it was beautiful.

462
00:28:34,647 --> 00:28:35,868
Speaker 0: It was it was majestic.

463
00:28:36,329 --> 00:28:43,636
Speaker 1: I gotta say While that prank is awesome, and I love pranks if you're gonna pull the prank You've got to be ready for someone to punch you.

464
00:28:43,958 --> 00:28:44,600
Speaker 0: Yes all right.

465
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:51,610
Speaker 1: so all I want to say is the expression on the guy on the right's face as He goes from shock to screaming to shock to screaming.

466
00:28:51,891 --> 00:28:54,180
Speaker 1: He kind of opens and closes his mouth a bunch of times.

467
00:28:54,742 --> 00:28:55,404
Speaker 1: It's hilarious.

468
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:59,580
Speaker 1: And then when he punches the guy in the face with the banana equally hilarious.

469
00:29:01,581 --> 00:29:06,395
Speaker 0: Anyway, so there's a website I found I think someone sent this to me or something.

470
00:29:06,415 --> 00:29:07,940
Speaker 0: I'm not sure whoever you are.

471
00:29:08,101 --> 00:29:09,253
Speaker 0: I forget who you are.

472
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:13,592
Speaker 0: Sorry Anyway, it's called polar Rose calm and what.

473
00:29:13,632 --> 00:29:18,740
Speaker 0: this is the beta test of a new technology That's actually intuitive and I think pretty cool.

474
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:25,023
Speaker 0: It's like well, you know you go around the internet and someone says check out my new thing Twitter and you're like, whatever dude I don't get it.

475
00:29:25,425 --> 00:29:27,713
Speaker 0: This is something I totally get and I think is awesome.

476
00:29:27,733 --> 00:29:29,600
Speaker 0: You know, all right, check this out first.

477
00:29:30,061 --> 00:29:33,070
Speaker 0: It's a Firefox plug-in also an IE plug-in but not yet.

478
00:29:33,712 --> 00:29:36,500
Speaker 0: It looks in your browser at pictures on web pages.

479
00:29:36,861 --> 00:29:41,080
Speaker 0: Oh, it looks for faces of people and it attempts to recognize them.

480
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:49,320
Speaker 0: If it doesn't recognize them it puts a little like Rose on like it like adds to the graphic this like lapel pin.

481
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:57,219
Speaker 0: That looks like the polar Rose logo right and you can click on it to sort of tell right like the name of who the person is and stuff like that.

482
00:29:57,239 --> 00:30:07,857
Speaker 0: and If on another website someone else looks at another picture of the same person and they have the extension It'll say we're pretty sure this is Scott Reuben, you know, is it Scott Reuben?

483
00:30:07,937 --> 00:30:08,138
Speaker 0: Yes.

484
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:22,723
Speaker 0: No information about him So you'll be able to browse the net with in Firefox with this extension and just looking at pictures of people It'll tell you who a lot of those people are even if the web page doesn't tell you that's really cool It is I do.

485
00:30:22,743 --> 00:30:24,772
Speaker 0: I think it's really cool and it'll really help.

486
00:30:24,853 --> 00:30:37,880
Speaker 0: for you know going around the internet Just looking at pictures of people Recognizing them recognizing famous people, you know It'll improve facial recognition technology, you know across people at like different ages.

487
00:30:37,940 --> 00:30:49,049
Speaker 0: So like, you know someone with a low a young and someone old with the who are the same person It'll name them both the same and maybe it'll be able to start recognizing people, you know From a picture and now when they're younger.

488
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:49,170
Speaker 0: and

489
00:30:49,552 --> 00:30:57,920
Speaker 1: I just really really look forward to the day Which I think is gonna happen in our lifetime where I can wear glasses or have a cyber implant or whatever probably glasses

490
00:30:58,542 --> 00:30:58,842
Speaker 0: Where

491
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:04,940
Speaker 1: it'll just show everyone's names floating over their heads all the time and it'll just figure it out based on technology like this.

492
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:10,751
Speaker 0: And then if I double click on those names, I'll get their Facebook Yes, or maybe it'll tell me stats about him.

493
00:31:10,771 --> 00:31:12,578
Speaker 1: Like the last time I attempted to kill them.

494
00:31:12,638 --> 00:31:12,959
Speaker 1: I don't know.

495
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:13,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, something like that.

496
00:31:14,072 --> 00:31:17,951
Speaker 0: or you know Maybe they'll be red which means they're evil and they're gonna get me.

497
00:31:18,031 --> 00:31:19,978
Speaker 0: but green means they're not PvP.

498
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:22,924
Speaker 0: I'm alright Okay, right.

499
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:28,280
Speaker 1: So this is one of those kind of throwaway Thursdays throwaway Thursdays.

500
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:34,173
Speaker 1: You can always tell a throwaway Thursday because we either Review a movie which means we couldn't come up with anything better.

501
00:31:34,715 --> 00:31:40,520
Speaker 0: So we're gonna talk about What movie today or we talk about a food related topic?

502
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:41,762
Speaker 0: Yeah food.

503
00:31:41,863 --> 00:31:46,260
Speaker 0: It seems like there's a lot of requests and a lot of show ideas for food.

504
00:31:46,581 --> 00:31:49,652
Speaker 0: We could probably turn Thursdays into food days if we wanted to.

505
00:31:49,672 --> 00:31:51,820
Speaker 0: I still didn't have a big drumstick as the icon.

506
00:31:51,965 --> 00:31:55,460
Speaker 1: Yeah Our best food episode ever was when we had our friend Adam odd.

507
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:59,333
Speaker 1: I was a good food episode when he told the story of him and his friends.

508
00:31:59,774 --> 00:32:03,072
Speaker 1: all Americans in Japan Basically eating all.

509
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:04,040
Speaker 1: they ate all the sushi.

510
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:07,179
Speaker 1: There was an all-you-can-eat like sushi like sushi and food place.

511
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:11,842
Speaker 1: When basically you can eat all you can eat for like an hour and you pay a set price They ate it all.

512
00:32:12,184 --> 00:32:13,168
Speaker 1: they just ate everything.

513
00:32:13,188 --> 00:32:16,059
Speaker 1: that came until there was nothing left and no one knew what to do.

514
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:16,865
Speaker 0: All right.

515
00:32:16,885 --> 00:32:30,160
Speaker 0: So today I'm gonna talk about Candy, I like candy All right, so the thing about candy first off I want to say is that when I was a kid candy was like gold.

516
00:32:30,661 --> 00:32:36,700
Speaker 1: Oh candy was like a Halloween was my favorite holiday like a Jolly Rancher was like a silver dollar.

517
00:32:37,166 --> 00:32:41,029
Speaker 1: I mean when I got candy I was always I had this debate because I'd be holding it.

518
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:44,140
Speaker 1: and it's do I eat it all now or do I save some?

519
00:32:44,622 --> 00:32:48,099
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz I might not have candy five minutes from now, I don't know.

520
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:53,615
Speaker 0: Basically, I couldn't be happier than if I had candy all the time when I was a kid.

521
00:32:53,715 --> 00:32:55,743
Speaker 0: as long as I didn't eat so Much I got sick.

522
00:32:56,084 --> 00:32:59,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, which only happened twice a year the eggs and every year was the same times.

523
00:33:00,121 --> 00:33:03,980
Speaker 1: It was always Halloween night and then the night after Halloween.

524
00:33:05,516 --> 00:33:10,520
Speaker 0: so now Candy, I still like some candies not all candies.

525
00:33:10,901 --> 00:33:18,059
Speaker 0: Actually, I think I don't like less candies than I used to but I like different candies And I don't like it as much and I eat it a lot less.

526
00:33:18,745 --> 00:33:23,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean when I was a kid I would eat pretty much any amount of candy you gave me.

527
00:33:23,115 --> 00:33:24,080
Speaker 1: give me enough time there.

528
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:26,227
Speaker 0: I didn't like every candy when I was.

529
00:33:26,408 --> 00:33:29,820
Speaker 1: one thing I've never liked are those goddamn puffy circus peanut.

530
00:33:30,121 --> 00:33:31,346

00:33:37,912 --> 00:33:39,540
Speaker 0: on Halloween old people give you candy.

536
00:33:39,580 --> 00:33:42,653
Speaker 0: That's always different from normal people, you know, it's like normal people.

539
00:33:51,434 --> 00:33:53,886
Speaker 1: see a lot of times I was leery of those things.

540
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:58,043
Speaker 1: my dad would always say at least try it before you knock it and a lot of times it Was really good.

541
00:33:58,184 --> 00:34:01,240
Speaker 0: No, I tried all of them and they all sucked anyway.

542
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:03,665
Speaker 0: Yeah candy.

543
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:04,450
Speaker 0: It's yummy.

544
00:34:04,973 --> 00:34:15,210

546
00:34:19,801 --> 00:34:22,690
Speaker 0: Favorite of all time is hard to say it would.

Speaker 0: It's a. it's a circle of chocolate with a mint cream in it.

556
00:34:42,009 --> 00:34:42,560
Speaker 0: It's perfect.

557
00:34:42,966 --> 00:34:46,020
Speaker 1: Actually when I was a kid I used to really really like those Andy's man.

558
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,418
Speaker 0: These are awesome because I would never buy them in my house.

559
00:34:48,841 --> 00:34:50,588
Speaker 0: My grandma always had them.

560
00:34:51,009 --> 00:34:59,720
Speaker 1: so whenever went to my grandma's house if you like Andy's candies Oh, man, when I was a little kid It was like the crazy treat because my parents were always little to buy him because we bought him all the time.

561
00:34:59,981 --> 00:35:02,192
Speaker 1: So every now and then they'd be like we're buying them.

562
00:35:02,353 --> 00:35:03,760
Speaker 0: those after eight things also work.

563
00:35:04,101 --> 00:35:07,275
Speaker 1: The thing is I liked him but I liked him mostly because of the mint.

564
00:35:07,677 --> 00:35:09,459
Speaker 1: and I remember as a kid I'd always be like man.

565
00:35:10,161 --> 00:35:15,043
Speaker 1: I wish I could have one where it was mint on the outside and chocolate on the inside and then they made those and then They made those.

566
00:35:15,184 --> 00:35:17,072
Speaker 0: and uh, we should buy some next time.

567
00:35:17,092 --> 00:35:19,020
Speaker 1: right the grocery thing is I don't like him anymore.

568
00:35:19,181 --> 00:35:19,946
Speaker 0: Oh, I still love them.

569
00:35:19,967 --> 00:35:24,654
Speaker 1: They're great thing is I mean, I liked him as a kid But now that I've had better mint and better job.

570
00:35:24,674 --> 00:35:25,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, it isn't that minty.

571
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:27,951
Speaker 0: I would like them more if they were more minty.

572
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:35,339
Speaker 0: that is not only that it's the Rappiest chocolate and they're really kind of dry and stiff actually dry as if I found them to actually be kind of mushy.

573
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,330
Speaker 1: You gotta like leave them out warm to get them that way.

574
00:35:38,350 --> 00:35:40,237
Speaker 0: No, actually you put them in the fridge.

575
00:35:40,277 --> 00:35:40,980
Speaker 0: That's what I do with them.

576
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,326
Speaker 1: I just I don't like them anymore.

577
00:35:42,346 --> 00:35:44,154
Speaker 1: They're the chocolate so cheap.

578
00:35:44,174 --> 00:35:45,380
Speaker 1: The mint flavor is so cheap.

579
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:49,920
Speaker 0: They could be much improved if you use a high quality dark chocolate and a more minty or mint.

580
00:35:50,101 --> 00:35:52,760
Speaker 0: I agree, but they're still alright cuz it's still mint chocolate.

581
00:35:53,273 --> 00:35:55,730
Speaker 0: But yeah Let's talk about can't admit M&Ms cuz.

582
00:35:56,232 --> 00:35:57,237
Speaker 1: candy bars are the big one.

583
00:35:57,257 --> 00:36:02,337
Speaker 1: when I was a kid I could eat like a double king-sized Snickers bar and not even blink.

584
00:36:02,577 --> 00:36:06,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, definitely I could eat a freakin Charleston chew when I was a kid and not blink.

585
00:36:07,061 --> 00:36:10,012
Speaker 0: Charleston shoes actually kind of one of the few chewy things I do like.

586
00:36:10,032 --> 00:36:15,031
Speaker 1: I used to eat mostly Snickers bars and Anything with puffed rice in it like crackles.

587
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:15,936
Speaker 1: Leslie's crunch.

588
00:36:16,036 --> 00:36:16,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, I like those.

589
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:19,408
Speaker 0: I like pretty much all candy bars except for butterfingers.

590
00:36:19,428 --> 00:36:20,050
Speaker 0: They're disgusting.

591
00:36:20,271 --> 00:36:21,615
Speaker 1: Ah, see that I liked.

592
00:36:22,016 --> 00:36:23,843
Speaker 1: there's one kind of butter finger That was different.

593
00:36:24,224 --> 00:36:24,465
Speaker 0: Also.

594
00:36:24,506 --> 00:36:25,932
Speaker 0: I don't like anything with the coconut.

595
00:36:26,012 --> 00:36:28,464
Speaker 0: I'm enjoying mounds can both suck a dick Got nuts.

596
00:36:28,927 --> 00:36:29,612
Speaker 0: No moms.

597
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:36,055
Speaker 0: Don't yeah, so I think the one I'm so the one I ate more than any other was the three musketeers.

598
00:36:36,536 --> 00:36:37,740
Speaker 1: Ah, seals were okay.

599
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:42,540
Speaker 1: I ate them a lot mostly because my grandparents bought them all the time.

600
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,946
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think I might prefer the Milky Way technically but for some reason I just always ate three musketeers And I was three musketeers.

601
00:36:48,966 --> 00:36:51,440
Speaker 1: There's like they were actually not that bad for you.

602
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:56,000
Speaker 0: Well, because the chocolate on the inside is sort of like this light and fluffy kind of mousse.

603
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,467
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's mostly artificial cancer-causing stuff.

604
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:03,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's in lieu of you know, I guess fat card attack causing stuff.

605
00:37:03,762 --> 00:37:13,160
Speaker 1: I mean when I was a kid, I liked the dense candy bars like the Snickers bar Which was just like caramel and peanuts and chocolate, you know, that's one thing the Snickers commercials that I remember.

606
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,200
Speaker 0: We're kind of honest which is hey, are you really hungry?

607
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:19,392
Speaker 0: Do you need to something to hold you over and so you can get a meal?

608
00:37:19,774 --> 00:37:21,080
Speaker 0: Snickers does work for that?

609
00:37:21,441 --> 00:37:24,520
Speaker 0: It's a. it feels like a lot of food in a very small amount of space.

610
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:26,953
Speaker 1: See it used to and I used to eat them all the time.

611
00:37:26,974 --> 00:37:27,215
Speaker 1: course.

612
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:36,167
Speaker 1: as a kid I think back to how much food I ate like from the ages of nine to about 19 Aside from drinking like six or seven cans of dr.

613
00:37:36,208 --> 00:37:40,177
Speaker 1: Pepper every single day and drinking like two glasses of orange juice every morning.

614
00:37:40,197 --> 00:37:43,648
Speaker 1: I Ate like a Snickers bar every day too.

615
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,999
Speaker 0: when I was a kid I could eat like especially high school years.

616
00:37:47,362 --> 00:37:52,355
Speaker 0: I could just eat a zillion foods Especially candy, but I was a bottomless pit for eating food.

617
00:37:52,415 --> 00:37:53,058
Speaker 0: now not so much.

618
00:37:53,098 --> 00:37:57,940
Speaker 1: I don't know I really can't eat a candy bar like almost any candy bar except a Milky Way.

619
00:37:58,101 --> 00:38:00,049
Speaker 0: I can but I can only eat like one.

620
00:38:00,330 --> 00:38:11,524
Speaker 1: see I can't like the thought and it only if I'm hungry The thought of eating an entire Snickers bar or an entire anything other than like a fancy-pants chocolate bar some white chocolate or something White chocolate.

621
00:38:11,544 --> 00:38:12,829
Speaker 0: I could eat just infinite white chocolate.

622
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:15,580
Speaker 1: white chocolate is like the best thing especially if it's real white chocolate.

623
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:19,592
Speaker 0: I mean fake white chocolate is okay, but real white chocolate expensive.

624
00:38:19,812 --> 00:38:20,735
Speaker 0: It is real expensive.

625
00:38:20,775 --> 00:38:22,500
Speaker 0: God damn goddamn is right.

626
00:38:23,005 --> 00:38:27,173
Speaker 1: Actually, it's not even chocolate but the worst thing I ever did but also the best thing.

627
00:38:27,214 --> 00:38:30,832
Speaker 1: we were in Wildwood right and You can get really good fudge in Wildwood.

628
00:38:30,852 --> 00:38:33,704
Speaker 1: like for fudge places though Douglas is the best.

629
00:38:33,865 --> 00:38:36,030
Speaker 0: Douglas fudge is the best for they have a pavilion.

630
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:47,860
Speaker 1: Yes, but I got I free was like Chocolate and peanut butter fudge like mixed together and I got one bar of you know One of those like four and a half inch five inch long bars of fudge.

631
00:38:48,241 --> 00:38:56,388
Speaker 1: It's like an inch square by an engine and I was carrying it around and I just ate the whole thing like a candy bar Yeah in the span of like five minutes like ice.

632
00:38:56,548 --> 00:39:02,632
Speaker 0: it's weird because I remember fudge being heavier and more filling in the stomach But see it really isn't so much.

633
00:39:02,652 --> 00:39:03,417
Speaker 1: Well, it kind of is.

634
00:39:03,477 --> 00:39:03,960
Speaker 1: I was fooled.

635
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:05,444
Speaker 1: You see I could use.

636
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:10,158
Speaker 1: I could have probably eaten a half of that thing had been okay, but I ate the whole bar.

637
00:39:11,143 --> 00:39:17,085
Speaker 1: That was like a quarter pound of fudge mm-hmm and About 20 minutes later.

638
00:39:17,165 --> 00:39:23,082
Speaker 1: I started to play DDR and I made it through half of one song and that was the end of that Alrighty.

639
00:39:23,465 --> 00:39:24,310
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's weird.

640
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,779
Speaker 0: It's like when I was a kid.

641
00:39:26,262 --> 00:39:30,178
Speaker 0: Whatever it tasted better was better and it did nothing else matter.

642
00:39:30,278 --> 00:39:31,925
Speaker 0: now I'm older.

643
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:35,860
Speaker 0: what I look for in candy is tastes real good, but it's also real light.

644
00:39:35,981 --> 00:39:38,744
Speaker 0: It's like cheesecake which isn't really candy But it tastes like candy.

645
00:39:39,386 --> 00:39:39,506
Speaker 0: is?

646
00:39:39,968 --> 00:39:43,460
Speaker 0: I want to eat a cheesecake where I can eat a lot of it without filling up.

647
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:49,284
Speaker 0: I want to be light and fluffy, but I want it to taste just as good as the super dense like Rising.

648
00:39:49,505 --> 00:39:52,460
Speaker 0: it's like I go someplace and they have like the super dense chocolate cake.

649
00:39:52,562 --> 00:39:54,865
Speaker 0: I just can't eat that anymore even though I love the taste of it.

650
00:39:54,885 --> 00:39:55,970
Speaker 1: that's what it really comes down to.

651
00:39:55,990 --> 00:40:08,891
Speaker 1: when I was a kid like I could eat half of a cheesecake no matter how dense it was and I could just eat dense foods and foods that had like more calories per pound than is Reasonable for human being to consume nowadays.

652
00:40:08,911 --> 00:40:12,287
Speaker 1: if I try to eat dense food like that I just can't.

653
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:13,879
Speaker 1: my body says whoa, you don't need this.

654
00:40:14,221 --> 00:40:18,111
Speaker 0: Yeah, like you do I buy one of those big thick like chocolate dessert cakes.

655
00:40:18,151 --> 00:40:26,180
Speaker 0: that but you know, I could eat like a Slice of it that's pretty thin and that's and then I'm done and I'd have to share it with like a whole table of people.

656
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:33,504
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean my grandma used to make these brownies and they were like the best brownies in the world, but they were Ultra dense.

657
00:40:34,026 --> 00:40:37,080
Speaker 1: they were like a half inch thick and they were heavy.

658
00:40:37,523 --> 00:40:40,200
Speaker 1: It's kind of like when you pick up a piece of metal and it's heavier than you expect.

659
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,579
Speaker 1: That's what these things were like and they were full of walnuts.

660
00:40:43,441 --> 00:40:47,675
Speaker 1: Oh, they were the best things ever, but now I can't imagine eating more than like a square inch.

661
00:40:48,176 --> 00:40:50,203
Speaker 0: Yeah without getting sick It's just too much.

662
00:40:50,745 --> 00:40:53,574
Speaker 1: I just and I still can eat the same amount of calories.

663
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:55,180
Speaker 1: I just can't eat those dense foods.

664
00:40:55,481 --> 00:40:56,806
Speaker 0: It's got to be over time.

665
00:40:56,826 --> 00:41:00,320
Speaker 0: You got to spread it out thin, you know, I can eat a thousand calories.

666
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:01,726
Speaker 0: It just takes me half a day.

667
00:41:01,746 --> 00:41:02,790
Speaker 1: You can't eat ten calories.

668
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:03,653
Speaker 1: You can't eat ten peeps.

669
00:41:04,356 --> 00:41:05,260
Speaker 0: I can't eat a single peep.

670
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:05,963
Speaker 0: They're disgusting.

671
00:41:06,103 --> 00:41:10,019
Speaker 1: I can always eat one because the first peep I think hey a peep and I eat it.

672
00:41:10,461 --> 00:41:14,418
Speaker 1: And then I feel sick and I remember what peeps taste like and I remember what they feel like in your stomach.

673
00:41:14,478 --> 00:41:15,665
Speaker 0: peeps are not Good, they're not.

674
00:41:15,827 --> 00:41:16,533
Speaker 0: they're disgusting.

675
00:41:16,553 --> 00:41:17,380
Speaker 0: I don't know why anyone eats them.

676
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,363
Speaker 1: You know, that's another thing.

677
00:41:18,904 --> 00:41:25,565
Speaker 1: I can't eat things that they may not be dense, but they're just so sweet like cotton candy Cotton candy.

678
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:26,829
Speaker 1: I used to love cotton candy.

679
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:27,351
Speaker 0: I don't know.

680
00:41:27,371 --> 00:41:29,698
Speaker 0: I'm kind of as never big on cotton.

681
00:41:29,739 --> 00:41:30,782
Speaker 1: I loved it It was great.

682
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,531
Speaker 1: But now I eat cotton candy and it just hurts.

683
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:36,220
Speaker 0: See the sweetness doesn't really bother me so much.

684
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:41,646
Speaker 0: I mean for me sweet equals taste good, you know, it's like oh People say this is too sweet.

685
00:41:41,686 --> 00:41:42,329
Speaker 0: I'm like what you mean?

686
00:41:42,369 --> 00:41:43,594
Speaker 0: It tastes too good, right?

687
00:41:44,116 --> 00:41:44,779
Speaker 0: I don't know.

688
00:41:44,819 --> 00:41:52,822
Speaker 1: for me I think a lot of it is that I started eating and drinking a lot of different things after I went to college and then to you know to New York City and all this business.

689
00:41:52,902 --> 00:41:58,739
Speaker 1: and like drink, you know drink a Japanese soda like a ramune or like a seltzer spritzer or anything like that.

690
00:41:58,759 --> 00:41:59,822
Speaker 1: and They're not.

691
00:41:59,842 --> 00:42:03,760
Speaker 1: they don't have a lot of calories in them and they're really kind of light and they're not super sweet.

692
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:04,784
Speaker 1: They just they have flavor.

693
00:42:05,487 --> 00:42:07,695
Speaker 1: and now I can't drink super sweet things.

694
00:42:07,735 --> 00:42:08,599
Speaker 1: Like I can't even drink.

695
00:42:08,639 --> 00:42:13,140
Speaker 1: Dr Pepper, which was my favorite drink in the world for much of my life.

696
00:42:13,321 --> 00:42:15,940
Speaker 0: Maybe that's because I just don't drink soda at all.

697
00:42:16,021 --> 00:42:24,028
Speaker 0: So like because that you know A lot of kids and you drank a whole shit ton of soda at some point in your life Even if not currently and I just never did.

698
00:42:24,048 --> 00:42:27,999
Speaker 0: I drank mostly apple juice, which is you know, so I don't know.

699
00:42:28,481 --> 00:42:30,780
Speaker 1: See, I don't think that's it because it didn't desensitize me.

700
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,780
Speaker 1: In fact, if anything the more soda I drank the more I crave sweet things.

701
00:42:36,242 --> 00:42:46,726
Speaker 1: And once I stopped drinking soda partly because soda was expensive in college and I was kind of poor Well, I went for a top point at all this time and then yes I didn't water real expensive.

702
00:42:47,148 --> 00:42:47,329
Speaker 1: Yeah.

703
00:42:47,349 --> 00:42:48,854
Speaker 1: Well, it's not cheaper than water.

704
00:42:48,874 --> 00:42:50,520
Speaker 1: It's only cheaper than crap bottled water.

705
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:59,379
Speaker 1: Yeah but I just found that I couldn't drink super sweet things anymore after I stopped drinking soda for a couple years kind of like How we used to watch TV.

706
00:42:59,601 --> 00:43:04,060
Speaker 1: I used to watch a lot of TV and then I went to college and I didn't watch any TV because I didn't have time.

707
00:43:04,762 --> 00:43:08,312
Speaker 1: And then I'd go home for a while and the TV beyond.

708
00:43:08,793 --> 00:43:14,114
Speaker 1: and it wasn't just Oh TV it was Wow TV is really painful to watch and crappy.

709
00:43:14,134 --> 00:43:15,380
Speaker 0: Oh, what the fuck?

710
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:21,440
Speaker 1: I still have the same experience with television, but if I'd been watching TV all through college, I wouldn't have felt that way.

711
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,885
Speaker 1: I just would have watched more TV.

712
00:43:22,906 --> 00:43:28,675
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think so does the same way it could be but Maybe candy is also the same way.

713
00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:40,560
Speaker 0: when I was a kid maybe what I just kept eating candy at the same rate, you know, and and When I you know when I finally got money if I would have spent it all on candy Maybe I still would have kept on with the candy eating though

714
00:43:40,660 --> 00:43:45,317
Speaker 1: I think part of it too is just that kids need a lot more sugar calories than adults do

715
00:43:45,639 --> 00:43:45,940
Speaker 0: they do.

716
00:43:46,242 --> 00:43:58,960
Speaker 1: I mean as a kid think about it I get a bunch of candy and then I'd run around the house for like two hours like hitting my brother and jumping on the couch and having a pillow fight and running outside and chasing the dogs and rolling around and

717
00:43:59,101 --> 00:44:00,229
Speaker 0: Just to play a video game.

718
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:00,955
Speaker 0: I needed candy.

719
00:44:00,975 --> 00:44:05,559
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, and now I don't run around so much.

720
00:44:05,921 --> 00:44:08,312
Speaker 1: Yeah, I still do but even now I can't.

721
00:44:08,613 --> 00:44:10,040
Speaker 1: of course I can drink a Red Bull just fine.

722
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:11,266
Speaker 1: I can drink like five Red Bulls.

723
00:44:11,929 --> 00:44:13,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

724
00:44:13,155 --> 00:44:16,348
Speaker 1: I can't drink ten Red Bulls Yeah, but I mean the energy.

725
00:44:16,489 --> 00:44:23,073
Speaker 0: it seems like, you know kids get their energies from the sugar, you know They're immediate energies and adults go for like the caffeine or the Red Bull.

726
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:25,000
Speaker 0: and I wonder you know, what's better?

727
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:27,330
Speaker 0: Maybe adults should just be going for the sugar some more.

728
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:27,672
Speaker 0: I don't know.

729
00:44:27,812 --> 00:44:28,395
Speaker 1: actually as a kid.

730
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:34,219
Speaker 1: I went for the caffeine - In middle school, I was one of those kids who carried around the Jolt Cola every day.

731
00:44:35,201 --> 00:44:37,008
Speaker 1: And in high school, I was one of those kids.

732
00:44:37,209 --> 00:44:40,220
Speaker 1: I would I would basically keep two liters of soda in my locker.

733
00:44:41,121 --> 00:44:41,683
Speaker 0: Good job.

734
00:44:41,743 --> 00:44:43,890
Speaker 0: So let's talk about some other candies.

735
00:44:43,931 --> 00:44:45,135
Speaker 0: We talked about the candy bars.

736
00:44:45,155 --> 00:44:46,660
Speaker 0: I know rim has something to say about this.

737
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:47,485
Speaker 0: Let's talk about gum.

738
00:44:47,868 --> 00:44:51,711
Speaker 0: All right, I like gum, especially bazooka Joe and doublemint.

739
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:59,480
Speaker 0: I As a kid had braces for like eight years Braces for a while and I didn't chew gum while the braces were going on.

740
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:01,896
Speaker 0: But I did before and after.

741
00:45:01,977 --> 00:45:10,642
Speaker 1: the longer I mean as it went on when I had braces and had braces and couldn't chew gum gum the memory of what gum was kind of kept Elevating like.

742
00:45:10,662 --> 00:45:17,363
Speaker 1: it was this mystical thing and I kept gum was this awesome thing that I missed and I wanted it more and more As time went on.

743
00:45:17,824 --> 00:45:26,760
Speaker 1: and I remember I got my braces off and I was like goddamn goddamn goddamn son of a bitch And I went got some gum and I chewed it and I remember my orthodontist gave you gum.

744
00:45:26,981 --> 00:45:27,988
Speaker 0: So sugar-free gum.

745
00:45:28,049 --> 00:45:29,640
Speaker 0: as soon as you were dad the braces off.

746
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,026
Speaker 0: He had it at like every station.

747
00:45:31,066 --> 00:45:34,500
Speaker 1: mind it to hitting there and I wouldn't chew it because I those sugar-free thing.

748
00:45:34,682 --> 00:45:35,712
Speaker 0: Ah, they are disgusting.

749
00:45:35,732 --> 00:45:36,580
Speaker 0: I do not like the sugar.

750
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,652
Speaker 1: No, I went straight to a store and I bought me some double mint double mints.

751
00:45:40,692 --> 00:45:40,953
Speaker 0: good.

752
00:45:41,174 --> 00:45:45,586
Speaker 1: I like the double mint, but I Don't like bubble gum.

753
00:45:45,847 --> 00:45:47,453
Speaker 1: I don't like the flavor of bubble gum.

754
00:45:47,754 --> 00:45:49,240
Speaker 1: I don't like bubble gum flavored things.

755
00:45:49,922 --> 00:45:52,251
Speaker 1: The only bubble gum I can stand is double bubble.

756
00:45:52,753 --> 00:45:53,596
Speaker 0: see double bubbles.

757
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:55,424
Speaker 0: actually the gum I can't stand.

758
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:58,760
Speaker 0: it seems like the flavor of bubble gum is disgusting.

759
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:05,690
Speaker 0: well, no if people can't seem to agree on exactly what it is because Everything that calls itself bubble gum tastes different like bubble.

760
00:46:05,710 --> 00:46:06,853
Speaker 0: Yum disgusting.

761
00:46:07,114 --> 00:46:08,438
Speaker 0: bubble tape disgusting.

762
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:10,163
Speaker 0: Oh bubble Disgusting.

763
00:46:10,183 --> 00:46:15,840
Speaker 0: you've reminded me of bubble tape disgusting but zebra striped gum not so disgusting.

764
00:46:15,920 --> 00:46:19,773
Speaker 0: It's kind of fruity but bazooka Joe is the only bubble gum that tastes good.

765
00:46:20,154 --> 00:46:21,518
Speaker 0: I carefree is okay.

766
00:46:21,639 --> 00:46:22,602
Speaker 0: ish not really.

767
00:46:23,063 --> 00:46:25,188
Speaker 0: but the rest of them all kind of suck.

768
00:46:25,269 --> 00:46:32,420
Speaker 0: and the only other good gums are non bubble gums like double mint or Trident the the cinnamony trident.

769
00:46:32,882 --> 00:46:33,744
Speaker 1: I pretty much actually.

770
00:46:33,764 --> 00:46:38,540
Speaker 0: I used to chew Big Red like cinnaburst when I was a kid, but now cinnaburst I can't hand.

771
00:46:38,660 --> 00:46:40,207
Speaker 1: Oh, I got a fucking story.

772
00:46:40,347 --> 00:46:41,311
Speaker 0: I know you had this story.

773
00:46:41,351 --> 00:46:42,596
Speaker 0: I set it up for you.

774
00:46:42,757 --> 00:46:43,600
Speaker 1: You're beautiful Scott.

775
00:46:44,205 --> 00:46:56,500
Speaker 1: So in high school My school was the pilot program along with a few other schools in the area You know, there was cinnaburst and all those related burst with mint a burst flavor crystals, right?

776
00:46:56,880 --> 00:47:00,640
Speaker 1: Yep, so they tried to market fruit a burst and fruit a burst didn't do so.

777
00:47:00,700 --> 00:47:04,492
Speaker 0: Well, no, I didn't but I don't think any of the a burst is still around.

778
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:11,680
Speaker 1: but cinnaburst lasted the longest cuz it was pretty Good, it wasn't as good as Big Red back in the day, but the flavor crystals kind of worked.

779
00:47:12,681 --> 00:47:20,260
Speaker 1: Anyway, so my high school got a shipment as part of this promotion of like four or five pallets of this stuff.

780
00:47:20,541 --> 00:47:35,528
Speaker 1: We're talking like tens of thousands of individual five-stick packs of fruit a burst and they gave them out in the school And they did all this stuff with it And then they just stopped doing it and the school still had all this gum left over Fast forward.

781
00:47:35,549 --> 00:47:37,840
Speaker 1: I am a member of the quiz bowl team.

782
00:47:38,281 --> 00:47:45,939
Speaker 1: My school is quiz bowl team is actually super super good partly because a senior who was on the team at the time Was to the gum.

783
00:47:46,370 --> 00:47:58,379
Speaker 1: alright but as advice to say quiz bowl was like this awesome thing because basically we went to these tournaments and we were super into it and we had all these fun superstitions about like you can't shave if we've been out of streak and all that business.

784
00:47:58,399 --> 00:48:11,320
Speaker 1: and The guy who was in charge of the gum was also in charge of the quiz bowl And in charge of the gum meaning the gum was in one of his Offices because they didn't have anywhere else to put it and he refused to throw it away.

785
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:18,511
Speaker 1: So every time we went to a quiz bowl tournament He'd give everyone on the team one of these packs.

786
00:48:19,012 --> 00:48:27,000
Speaker 1: and it became this tradition of you Open the pack and you start chewing and you're not allowed to stop chewing until you lose a game.

787
00:48:27,681 --> 00:48:39,206
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you'd have this fruit a burst in your mouth and if we were on a streak for about nine hours You could reverse why you don't like gum.

788
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:44,342
Speaker 1: you could refresh in an emergency with like another stick or something but you could.

789
00:48:44,362 --> 00:48:51,059
Speaker 1: you had to keep the gum in your mouth pretty much until you lost a game and Sometimes we'd switch it up like at the lunch break.

790
00:48:51,481 --> 00:48:54,974
Speaker 1: We'd refresh and we take all new gum and that was well and good.

791
00:48:54,994 --> 00:48:56,138
Speaker 1: just vertebrates wasn't that bad?

792
00:48:56,178 --> 00:49:00,260
Speaker 1: even though you know If you chew gum for way too long you start to get a headache you start to feel like shit.

793
00:49:00,785 --> 00:49:02,319
Speaker 0: Indeed you get really clean teeth though.

794
00:49:02,569 --> 00:49:10,599
Speaker 1: Yeah But that wasn't so bad because the tradition some a lot of times we'd lose tournaments on purpose Just so we could go play Euchre in football for the rest of the time.

795
00:49:10,826 --> 00:49:13,509
Speaker 1: Nah with the other teams who also lost on purpose.

796
00:49:13,569 --> 00:49:20,276
Speaker 1: pre meditated Lee and then a bunch of shitty teams went to the Championship and our coach would yell at us like what the fuck those teams all suck.

797
00:49:20,316 --> 00:49:21,180
Speaker 1: Why do you get eliminated?

798
00:49:21,980 --> 00:49:26,723
Speaker 1: But anyway, so, uh fast forward two or three years now I'm a senior in high school.

799
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:28,649
Speaker 1: The tradition still goes.

800
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:32,340
Speaker 1: the fruit of burst is two years expired.

801
00:49:32,862 --> 00:49:36,336
Speaker 1: Uh-oh, it tastes like I don't know what it tasted like.

802
00:49:36,617 --> 00:49:37,480
Speaker 1: it was disgusting.

803
00:49:38,022 --> 00:49:39,187
Speaker 1: It was so brittle.

804
00:49:39,428 --> 00:49:42,120
Speaker 1: you bit into it and it would try to crack into three or four pieces.

805
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:44,046
Speaker 0: I hate when gum goes stale like that.

806
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:48,920
Speaker 1: It's basically ah, uh, all I want to say is the team kept up the tradition.

807
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:54,770
Speaker 1: I however While I kept up the new fruit of burst.

808
00:49:54,951 --> 00:49:56,597
Speaker 1: no, cuz you couldn't buy fruit burst anymore.

809
00:49:56,617 --> 00:49:57,360
Speaker 0: you bought different gum.

810
00:49:57,822 --> 00:50:03,379
Speaker 1: I just had different gum and I acted like I was true in the fruit of burst But I was totally chewing double min.

811
00:50:03,661 --> 00:50:13,726
Speaker 1: That's the way to go and I want to say everyone else as far as I could tell Was true in the fruit chew in the fruit of burst and I knew it because I saw him spit it out And it was always when you spit it out.

812
00:50:14,027 --> 00:50:15,512
Speaker 1: It was so brittle and expired.

813
00:50:15,873 --> 00:50:17,860
Speaker 1: They would break up into like two or three pieces.

814
00:50:17,940 --> 00:50:22,286
Speaker 0: Uh-oh, yeah Yeah, I remember in high school.

815
00:50:22,306 --> 00:50:24,837
Speaker 0: The winter fresh is really popular, but I never liked winter fresh.

816
00:50:24,878 --> 00:50:27,265
Speaker 0: It's disgusting All right, that's all I gotta add there.

817
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:32,880
Speaker 1: Yeah, I remember way back before Altoids became like super commonly marketed everywhere.

818
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:37,380
Speaker 1: Altoids were pushed on me by the high school teacher when I was in middle school of the bay.

819
00:50:37,440 --> 00:50:38,605
Speaker 0: I don't like out toys either.

820
00:50:38,625 --> 00:50:39,549
Speaker 1: I don't understand him.

821
00:50:39,609 --> 00:50:40,352
Speaker 1: I fucking love out.

822
00:50:40,372 --> 00:50:40,714
Speaker 1: You know what?

823
00:50:40,854 --> 00:50:41,577
Speaker 1: It's just peppermint.

824
00:50:41,818 --> 00:50:42,160
Speaker 1: That's it.

825
00:50:42,602 --> 00:50:43,286
Speaker 1: There's nothing to it.

826
00:50:43,326 --> 00:50:44,593
Speaker 1: It's just super strong peppermint.

827
00:50:44,613 --> 00:50:45,377
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan.

828
00:50:45,397 --> 00:50:49,754
Speaker 0: I like Man, I like peppermint even but Altoids not so much.

829
00:50:50,095 --> 00:50:52,505
Speaker 1: I don't know but I was in middle school You know, we were all into that.

830
00:50:52,846 --> 00:50:55,056
Speaker 0: Yeah extreme caffeine blah blah blah.

831
00:50:55,317 --> 00:50:56,060
Speaker 0: I wasn't into that.

832
00:50:56,180 --> 00:51:02,478
Speaker 1: I was avoid caffeine avoid Altoids kind of report and parcel to that, you know, yeah extreme caffeine extreme mint.

Speaker 1: I'm gonna need a whole package of peppermints, right?

835
00:51:04,930 --> 00:51:10,310
Speaker 1: I think a lot of people bought him because of the tin Yeah, and because they were really strong and they were kind of a cult thing.

836
00:51:10,350 --> 00:51:13,462
Speaker 1: and then Altoids decided it was time to market them Full-on.

837
00:51:13,502 --> 00:51:15,189
Speaker 1: and Altoids are really popular now.

838
00:51:15,209 --> 00:51:16,073
Speaker 1: There's a million flavors.

839
00:51:16,153 --> 00:51:16,876
Speaker 1: I like most of them.

Speaker 1: M&Ms are okay But I always like the M&M was peanuts in him.

863
00:51:59,472 --> 00:52:03,349
Speaker 0: M&Ms with peanuts are superior to M&Ms But M&Ms are okay pretty much anything.

864
00:52:03,369 --> 00:52:04,172
Speaker 0: This is M&M on.

865
00:52:04,192 --> 00:52:05,940
Speaker 0: it is gonna be good in some fashion.

866
00:52:06,402 --> 00:52:11,459
Speaker 0: I mean even when they came out with all those crazy M&M flavors like mint and peanut butter M&Ms and etc, etc.

867
00:52:12,523 --> 00:52:16,339
Speaker 0: None of them were as good as the actual peanut M&M, but they were okay.

868
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,813
Speaker 0: I wouldn't go for them on purpose.

869
00:52:18,873 --> 00:52:20,777
Speaker 1: But let's just talk about candy that sucks.

870
00:52:20,817 --> 00:52:22,660
Speaker 1: I think that's more fun candy that sucks.

871
00:52:22,861 --> 00:52:24,909
Speaker 1: I remember nerds nerds.

872
00:52:25,069 --> 00:52:26,193
Speaker 0: They're okay is?

873
00:52:26,495 --> 00:52:30,111
Speaker 1: I ate him but to this day I don't know why cuz I didn't like him there.

874
00:52:30,412 --> 00:52:31,156
Speaker 0: There's just nothing.

875
00:52:31,437 --> 00:52:33,406
Speaker 0: they're not bad But there's nothing really awesome.

876
00:52:33,426 --> 00:52:36,600
Speaker 1: those came to those packages where there were like two different sides to it.

877
00:52:36,942 --> 00:52:38,248
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

878
00:52:38,268 --> 00:52:40,680
Speaker 0: You know, what sucks is pretty much any lollipop.

879
00:52:40,941 --> 00:52:45,395
Speaker 0: That isn't either a blow pop the regular charms pop or a dumb dumb.

880
00:52:45,495 --> 00:52:47,763
Speaker 0: if it's not one of those three lollipops It sucks.

881
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:48,426
Speaker 1: I don't know.

882
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:51,300
Speaker 1: I like kind of those old-school rock candy pops.

883
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:52,923
Speaker 0: No, no good.

884
00:52:53,184 --> 00:52:56,794
Speaker 0: Like and you see like, you know the old-fashioned like giant swirly lollipops.

885
00:52:56,954 --> 00:52:57,717
Speaker 1: Those are terrible.

886
00:52:57,737 --> 00:52:58,920
Speaker 0: Those don't actually taste good.

887
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,784
Speaker 0: They're disgusting.

888
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,373
Speaker 1: Also, they're really hard to eat.

889
00:53:01,594 --> 00:53:02,660
Speaker 1: You're not gonna finish it.

890
00:53:02,861 --> 00:53:07,080
Speaker 1: You're gonna get sticky all over no matter what you try to do and then you're gonna drop it.

891
00:53:07,301 --> 00:53:08,548
Speaker 0: Yeah, it did.

892
00:53:08,568 --> 00:53:10,620
Speaker 0: I don't see the purpose of those other than decorations.

893
00:53:10,781 --> 00:53:16,560
Speaker 1: So does he can carry it around and say I has a lolly I guess but they're disgusting and there's no point to them.

894
00:53:16,600 --> 00:53:20,414
Speaker 0: If it's not a charms lollipop or a dumb dumb, it's ain't worth shit.

895
00:53:20,435 --> 00:53:21,478
Speaker 0: that includes tootsie pops.

896
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,606
Speaker 0: They suck I don't care how many bites it takes.

897
00:53:23,907 --> 00:53:24,831
Speaker 0: They're not good.

898
00:53:24,851 --> 00:53:26,075
Speaker 0: Tootsie rolls are good.

899
00:53:26,396 --> 00:53:27,400
Speaker 0: Lollipops are good.

900
00:53:27,722 --> 00:53:29,392
Speaker 0: Tootsie roll pops are not.

901
00:53:29,473 --> 00:53:30,580
Speaker 1: I liked all those weird.

902
00:53:30,942 --> 00:53:34,240
Speaker 1: I don't know if even tootsie roll made him but they were like vanilla, but they were a tootsie roll.

903
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,466
Speaker 0: I don't remember those.

904
00:53:35,526 --> 00:53:36,290
Speaker 0: I've never heard of such.

905
00:53:36,431 --> 00:53:37,255
Speaker 1: actually I remember as a kid.

906
00:53:37,275 --> 00:53:38,320
Speaker 1: I really like mothballs.

907
00:53:38,903 --> 00:53:41,394
Speaker 0: I don't know what a mothball they're basically just a fireball is.

908
00:53:41,414 --> 00:53:42,539
Speaker 1: there's malted milk balls.

909
00:53:43,083 --> 00:53:44,334
Speaker 0: Thing is atomic fireballs.

910
00:53:44,374 --> 00:53:45,080
Speaker 0: Remember when I was a kid?

911
00:53:45,140 --> 00:53:50,280
Speaker 0: There's this mystique about them like oh man eat atomic fireball used to have like a cup and some water there.

912
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,626
Speaker 0: So you wouldn't hurt yourself with them.

913
00:53:51,907 --> 00:53:52,892
Speaker 1: I would just eat like two of them.

914
00:53:52,912 --> 00:53:53,474
Speaker 1: They were great.

915
00:53:53,635 --> 00:53:54,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just loved him.

916
00:53:55,081 --> 00:53:57,530
Speaker 0: It was basically like a double cineverse in a way.

917
00:53:57,791 --> 00:54:03,559
Speaker 1: what I didn't like though were all those sour candies Like the ones that were like so sour it hurts floating head on them.

918
00:54:04,003 --> 00:54:05,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, all the ones hated those also.

919
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:06,967
Speaker 0: I never understood why anyone ate them.

920
00:54:07,269 --> 00:54:09,540
Speaker 1: a lot of people ate him just to prove how badass they were.

921
00:54:09,620 --> 00:54:10,323
Speaker 0: I think there was.

922
00:54:10,504 --> 00:54:13,095
Speaker 0: there was sort of this trend of candies that were just sort of.

923
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,320
Speaker 0: can you eat this?

924
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:15,545
Speaker 0: How awesome are you like?

925
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:18,920

926
00:54:19,020 --> 00:54:19,483
Speaker 0: Sell them to you.

927
00:54:19,524 --> 00:54:26,415
Speaker 0: and it was sort of cult around, you know At least this cult following of kids around crazy candies like the atomic fireball.

00:55:35,507 --> 00:55:40,825
Speaker 0: if it's not Twizzler brand if it's some other brand or if it's not the default flavor of Twizzler It tastes like ass.

959
00:55:41,147 --> 00:55:42,355
Speaker 1: I can still eat a Twizzler though.

960
00:55:42,375 --> 00:55:46,580
Speaker 0: Don't get me wrong I just I only like the plain Twizzler and it's awesome.

961
00:55:46,741 --> 00:55:48,748
Speaker 0: But all other kinds I once I remember.

962
00:55:48,769 --> 00:55:51,359
Speaker 0: I actually this is sort of a sad story.

963
00:55:51,379 --> 00:56:05,248
Speaker 0: in a way I was at someone's house for a sort of party in high school, right and there was some Twizzlers there And I just kept eating them and kept eating them kept eating them And I think I ate most of them or all of them like a whole bags worth almost, you know high school I could do that sort of thing.

964
00:56:05,268 --> 00:56:14,149
Speaker 0: Yep, and Because I had so many Twizzlers I was sort of hyped up and I sort of ended up playing Warcraft 2 on his computer And everyone else watched.

965
00:56:14,209 --> 00:56:16,280
Speaker 0: it was watching Holy Grail, which I'd never watched.

966
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:22,453
Speaker 0: But since they didn't try to sell me on it or anything I didn't realize what I was missing and I ended up watching it later at some other time.

967
00:56:22,815 --> 00:56:23,417
Speaker 1: Oh, man.

968
00:56:23,638 --> 00:56:28,212
Speaker 1: Yeah I want to do a show talking about that movie.

969
00:56:28,453 --> 00:56:33,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the first time I saw it We should right laugh so hard that I'd miss jokes.

970
00:56:33,702 --> 00:56:44,253
Speaker 0: But basically I was sitting there playing Warcraft 2 which I couldn't play at home and on the other side of the room All these people were laughing hysterically and I was just like yeah, whatever I'm playing this game, which I can't play at home.

971
00:56:44,494 --> 00:56:45,359
Speaker 1: That is really sad.

972
00:56:46,003 --> 00:56:47,992
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Twizzlers they fuck with my brain.

973
00:56:48,515 --> 00:56:49,560
Speaker 0: I couldn't make good decisions.

974
00:56:50,481 --> 00:56:55,340
Speaker 1: The things I always really there's all those stupid gimmick candies like the bloody the ring pops.

975
00:56:55,943 --> 00:56:58,116
Speaker 0: No, they're ring pops are just shitty pops.

976
00:56:58,176 --> 00:57:02,676
Speaker 1: that on a ring Yeah But they were really popular when I was in school and everyone wear them around the school.

977
00:57:02,696 --> 00:57:14,620
Speaker 0: the ones that were actually Okay, because they were practical the ones that came at the push pops that came out of a tube Didn't taste so great They didn't taste bad and it was practical to push him back in the tube and you wouldn't get sticky or anything.

978
00:57:14,801 --> 00:57:25,119
Speaker 1: Actually, I really like those suckers that were like a big sucker at the top with like an O on them And then the stick was just kind of this like piece of paper rolled up That was kind of in a u-shape stuck into it in two spots.

979
00:57:26,461 --> 00:57:28,206
Speaker 1: They're like generic cheapo suckers.

980
00:57:28,387 --> 00:57:29,169
Speaker 0: I don't remember those.

981
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:30,172
Speaker 1: Yeah in the Midwest.

982
00:57:30,212 --> 00:57:31,135
Speaker 1: We call them suckers.

983
00:57:31,737 --> 00:57:32,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's a lollipop.

984
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:34,026
Speaker 0: Fuck it's not a lollipop.

985
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:35,673
Speaker 1: lollipop sounds very effeminate.

986
00:57:36,014 --> 00:57:37,360
Speaker 1: I question your sexuality.

987
00:57:37,721 --> 00:57:38,223
Speaker 1: Sutter.

988
00:57:38,584 --> 00:57:39,867
Speaker 0: sucker sounds very.

989
00:57:40,229 --> 00:57:41,091
Speaker 1: it's not erotic.

990
00:57:41,151 --> 00:57:42,355
Speaker 1: It's not a lolly.

991
00:57:42,455 --> 00:57:45,669
Speaker 1: I'm not going to go lick my lolly I'm gonna suck on my sucker.

992
00:57:45,709 --> 00:57:46,313
Speaker 0: Goddamn it.

00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:50,895
Speaker 0: You're gonna suck on some dick is All right.

994
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:54,593
Speaker 0: Can we think of any other candy related things to talk about?

995
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:56,060
Speaker 1: I don't have many more anecdotes.

996
00:57:56,522 --> 00:58:05,037
Speaker 0: Yeah, most of them involve all their foods or jello or I like just chocolate bars Just flat chocolate like a bar of dark chocolate period.

997
00:58:05,178 --> 00:58:08,571
Speaker 1: oh, man Dark chocolate is like the best thing ever other than white chocolate.

998
00:58:08,772 --> 00:58:14,051
Speaker 0: I don't understand why I mean milk chocolate I guess is edible, but I don't like seek it out often.

999
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:16,620
Speaker 0: You know, it's usually I want dark chocolate or white chocolate.

1000
00:58:16,982 --> 00:58:19,314
Speaker 0: Why do they have this milk chocolate and these other?

1001
00:58:19,475 --> 00:58:20,038
Speaker 0: you know, it's like.

1002
00:58:20,098 --> 00:58:23,780
Speaker 0: come on It's probably that much more expensive or harder to make.

1003
00:58:23,981 --> 00:58:32,338
Speaker 1: Well, the one thing I've learned is that when it comes to chocolate Other than like the highest end of the spectrum the more expensive chocolate is superior.

1004
00:58:32,438 --> 00:58:39,260
Speaker 1: Well Except for except for brain brand name crap and like ultra fancy chocolate.

1005
00:58:39,340 --> 00:58:42,050
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is is this like cooking chocolate?

1006
00:58:42,111 --> 00:58:44,580
Speaker 0: right which is like real chocolate, but you can't eat that.

1007
00:58:44,620 --> 00:58:45,887
Speaker 0: it's meant for cooking and it's it's.

1008
00:58:45,987 --> 00:58:47,355
Speaker 0: it'll ruin you if you try to eat it.

1009
00:58:48,179 --> 00:58:53,040
Speaker 0: and Then there's like Godiva chocolate which is better than your average store chocolate.

1010
00:58:53,141 --> 00:58:54,167
Speaker 0: you know Hershey's or whatever.

1011
00:58:54,187 --> 00:58:59,655
Speaker 0: Hershey's actually isn't so bad, but It's cost so much money for Godiva chocolate that it's not.

1012
00:58:59,776 --> 00:59:00,600
Speaker 0: it's not worth that money.

1013
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:03,740
Speaker 0: Hershey's is a better deal because for Hershey's you can get a shit ton for like a dollar.

1014
00:59:03,942 --> 00:59:05,880
Speaker 1: I wasn't saying you should buy the expensive shot.

1015
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:08,349
Speaker 1: I'm just saying the expensive chocolate is really freaking good.

1016
00:59:08,369 --> 00:59:11,220
Speaker 0: Godiva chocolate is freaking good, but it's not worth the price.

1017
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:20,893
Speaker 0: However, there are other chocolates you can get that are more expensive than Hershey's but worth the enhanced price such as a Toblerone Or something all the Toblerone.

1018
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:22,020
Speaker 0: Toblerone is awesome.

1019
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:25,080
Speaker 0: It comes in a cardboard box and it's got all these little triangles.

1020
00:59:25,201 --> 00:59:29,102
Speaker 0: You can break them off one at a time and they got nice little nuts in them And it's good.

1021
00:59:29,183 --> 00:59:31,270
Speaker 0: The chocolate is better than Hershey's chocolate.

1022
00:59:31,892 --> 00:59:33,277
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, actually along those lines.

1023
00:59:33,317 --> 00:59:34,240
Speaker 1: those Ferrero Rochers.

1024
00:59:34,861 --> 00:59:36,509
Speaker 0: I'm not a fan of the Ferrero Rocher.

1025
00:59:36,871 --> 00:59:37,333
Speaker 0: I don't like it.

1026
00:59:37,353 --> 00:59:38,620
Speaker 1: So I used to like those a lot.

1027
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:40,167
Speaker 0: No, Greg was the one who bought them.

1028
00:59:40,890 --> 00:59:41,051
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

1029
00:59:41,312 --> 00:59:42,859
Speaker 0: I bought the Cadbury eggs.

1030
00:59:43,322 --> 00:59:43,886
Speaker 1: Oh the Cadbury.

1031
00:59:44,067 --> 00:59:45,820
Speaker 1: do you see how the Cadbury eggs are smaller now?

1032
00:59:46,101 --> 00:59:50,163
Speaker 0: I do see that and notice I haven't bought any last year in This.

1033
00:59:50,284 --> 00:59:51,875
Speaker 1: I used to always think I liked him.

1034
00:59:51,935 --> 00:59:52,660
Speaker 1: every time I ate one.

1035
00:59:52,700 --> 00:59:53,604
Speaker 1: I didn't actually like it.

1036
00:59:53,966 --> 00:59:56,276
Speaker 0: see I like the cream on the inside.

1037
00:59:56,296 --> 00:59:57,160
Speaker 0: There's nothing about that cream.

1038
00:59:57,200 --> 00:59:58,814
Speaker 0: The chocolate is just normal chocolate.

1039
00:59:58,834 --> 00:59:59,600
Speaker 0: big deal, right?

1040
00:59:59,960 --> 01:00:03,040
Speaker 0: And it's just a chocolate container for this awesome cream that they make.

1041
01:00:03,100 --> 01:00:09,200
Speaker 0: I don't know what the hell's in that cream and Making them smaller means a lot less cream and all I want is that cream and like a tube or something.

1042
01:00:09,381 --> 01:00:13,160
Speaker 1: I remember I saw a website up that the idea of that made me a little nauseous.

1043
01:00:13,622 --> 01:00:18,300
Speaker 1: I saw a website where a guy tried to cook a cake and he replaced eggs with Cadbury eggs.

1044
01:00:19,106 --> 01:00:19,811
Speaker 0: That didn't work.

1045
01:00:20,214 --> 01:00:20,819
Speaker 1: It didn't work.

1046
01:00:20,940 --> 01:00:28,603
Speaker 0: No I think what they should do is I realized that I can just buy frosting which is you don't know cake frosting is just Crisco And sugar basically.

1047
01:00:28,623 --> 01:00:30,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, so it's basically just trans fat and sugar.

1048
01:00:31,050 --> 01:00:34,040
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I realized I could just eat frosting.

1049
01:00:34,100 --> 01:00:35,344
Speaker 0: Why do I need to get cat?

1050
01:00:35,384 --> 01:00:50,120
Speaker 1: that was a bad revelation in high in college when we were kind of poor and we realized that In terms of like, you know taste and enjoy ability and all that Crisco and sugar aka Frosting was a lot cheaper than ice cream.

1051
01:00:50,621 --> 01:01:03,459
Speaker 0: You could just buy a tub of like cake frosting for like a dollar and then take a spoon and have at it And if you ate it really slowly That was a pretty good deal for your money and we did that probably more often than we should have.

1052
01:01:04,044 --> 01:01:05,739
Speaker 0: No, I think we did it about the right number of times.

1053
01:01:06,561 --> 01:01:11,020
Speaker 1: I still think that more than one is more times because you should have learned your lesson.

1054
01:01:11,301 --> 01:01:11,602
Speaker 0: I didn't.

1055
01:01:11,683 --> 01:01:12,265
Speaker 0: I learned a lesson.

1056
01:01:12,305 --> 01:01:13,088
Speaker 0: It tasted really good.

1057
01:01:13,189 --> 01:01:14,073
Speaker 1: I learned my lesson.

1058
01:01:14,354 --> 01:01:15,840
Speaker 1: I felt pretty crappy after that.

1059
01:01:15,981 --> 01:01:16,342
Speaker 0: I didn't.

1060
01:01:16,382 --> 01:01:17,005
Speaker 0: I felt great.

1061
01:01:17,146 --> 01:01:20,280
Speaker 1: Actually what I used to do a lot in college is just eat cookie dough.

1062
01:01:20,361 --> 01:01:21,858
Speaker 1: I'd buy a tube of cookie dough just eat it.

1063
01:01:22,221 --> 01:01:23,024
Speaker 0: Yeah, I didn't do that.

1064
01:01:23,084 --> 01:01:26,117
Speaker 0: But when I do make cookies, I eat some of the cookie dough and I like.

1065
01:01:26,198 --> 01:01:27,625
Speaker 0: I like cookie Dough ice cream a lot.

1066
01:01:28,168 --> 01:01:29,254
Speaker 1: I don't know why cookie dough.

1067
01:01:29,315 --> 01:01:30,200
Speaker 1: ice cream is awesome.

1068
01:01:30,401 --> 01:01:33,678
Speaker 0: It's a. the thing is people seem to make this mistake with the cookie dough.

1069
01:01:33,739 --> 01:01:34,020
Speaker 0: ice cream.

1070
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:37,020
Speaker 0: Is they used to in the early days not put enough cookie dough in there?

1071
01:01:37,422 --> 01:01:40,200
Speaker 0: It's like what the hell you should be freakin loading this thing up with huge junk.

1072
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:43,451
Speaker 1: Basically, I want cookie dough with ice cream and not the other way around.

1073
01:01:43,551 --> 01:01:44,875
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

1074
01:01:44,895 --> 01:01:46,240
Speaker 0: That's what I'm saying.

1075
01:01:46,661 --> 01:01:50,033
Speaker 1: Actually the best thing in the world along those lines.

1076
01:01:50,053 --> 01:01:51,117
Speaker 1: We've already gone on long enough.

1077
01:01:51,137 --> 01:01:51,900
Speaker 1: I think we'll end on this.

1078
01:01:53,187 --> 01:01:55,520
Speaker 1: I used to work at the Bella sub shop in Rochester.

1079
01:01:55,580 --> 01:02:00,359
Speaker 1: Well that one summer the summer of awesome where me Alex and Scott lived in Rochester.

1080
01:02:01,483 --> 01:02:12,097
Speaker 1: I just play Puerto Rico ten times Yeah like every day and I drove to the beach a bunch of times up north a bit and we just kind of Live the lives we would live if we had nothing to do except live our lives.

1081
01:02:12,378 --> 01:02:23,353
Speaker 1: Yep, and I worked at this de Bella sub shop to have money to buy food and I learned from the veterans that in the back freezer I mean de Bella's has really fucking good cookies in and of itself.

1082
01:02:23,434 --> 01:02:24,860
Speaker 1: the cookies they have are awesome.

1083
01:02:25,262 --> 01:02:29,140
Speaker 1: If you're ever in Rochester, New York buy one of their chocolate chip cookies with walnuts.

1084
01:02:29,441 --> 01:02:30,605
Speaker 1: You will not regret it.

1085
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:33,414
Speaker 0: I don't think you're gonna regret most chocolate chip cookies.

1086
01:02:33,434 --> 01:02:35,200
Speaker 1: No, but these cookies are above average.

1087
01:02:35,300 --> 01:02:37,180
Speaker 1: Alright, they're awesome.

1088
01:02:38,004 --> 01:02:39,151
Speaker 1: So they get.

1089
01:02:39,211 --> 01:02:44,039
Speaker 1: I mean they don't make the dough there But they buy the dough frozen and then they thought and they bake them fresh.

1090
01:02:44,762 --> 01:02:47,753
Speaker 1: The dough is sent in cookie form frozen.

1091
01:02:47,774 --> 01:02:49,460
Speaker 1: It is stored in the back.

1092
01:02:49,921 --> 01:02:52,269
Speaker 1: it does not freeze to the point that it is rock hard.

1093
01:02:52,790 --> 01:03:04,428
Speaker 1: if you open an individual package of a cookie and Eat it in its frozen state it is perhaps one of the top 10 most Delicious things in the world.

1094
01:03:04,488 --> 01:03:07,216
Speaker 0: I don't think it's that good, but it's really damn good.

1095
01:03:07,256 --> 01:03:08,059
Speaker 1: You've never had it.

1096
01:03:08,982 --> 01:03:09,685
Speaker 1: I was dubious.

1097
01:03:09,725 --> 01:03:13,020
Speaker 1: Someone's like go in the back and eat the frozen cookies and they were freaking out about it.

1098
01:03:13,020 --> 01:03:13,684
Speaker 1: So I'm like whatever.

1099
01:03:13,704 --> 01:03:16,319
Speaker 1: so I go back there one day and I'm clean and I'm like, you know what?

1100
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:23,020
Speaker 0: All right, and I ended up eating like five of them and then I probably good but they can't be that you're so good.

1101
01:03:23,201 --> 01:03:23,805
Speaker 0: I like a cookie.

1102
01:03:23,825 --> 01:03:24,651
Speaker 0: which cookie?

1103
01:03:24,671 --> 01:03:25,999
Speaker 1: which cookie which is real good?

1104
01:03:26,201 --> 01:03:30,280
Speaker 1: Yeah cookie which has got to be like super dry ice frozen though.

1105
01:03:30,621 --> 01:03:38,820
Speaker 0: Well, the thing about a cookie which is I want the cookies to be like not warm but cold but squishy You know, they got to be chewy cookies, right?

1106
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:44,320
Speaker 0: But the ice cream has to be freaking like solid hard vanilla ice cream with chips.

1107
01:03:44,621 --> 01:03:45,585
Speaker 0: I like when this chips even

1108
01:03:45,605 --> 01:03:57,328
Speaker 1: though I like it to be hard at first but with ice cream sandwiches or anything like that I love it the most if the ice cream around the edges is so melted that it's not gonna drip yet But it basically just mushes into my mouth.

1109
01:03:57,690 --> 01:03:58,734
Speaker 0: I don't like that so much.

1110
01:03:59,196 --> 01:04:00,080
Speaker 0: I like hard ice cream.

1111
01:04:00,561 --> 01:04:02,869
Speaker 1: All right, we've talked long enough about that.

1112
01:04:03,371 --> 01:04:04,796
Speaker 1: We're going into ice cream territory.

1113
01:04:04,816 --> 01:04:06,020
Speaker 1: I think that's gonna be another show.

1114
01:04:06,241 --> 01:04:08,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, and there's probably a lot of other candies out there.

1115
01:04:08,600 --> 01:04:16,188
Speaker 0: We could just talk and talk and talk about how we hate the watermelon flavor Jolly Rancher and ah watermelon flavored anything That's not a watermelon tastes like an asshole.

1116
01:04:16,208 --> 01:04:17,232
Speaker 0: Yeah and stuff like that.

1117
01:04:17,352 --> 01:04:20,104
