1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,259
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday, February 9th, 2021.

2
00:00:10,259 --> 00:00:10,500
Speaker 1: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,637 --> 00:00:14,109
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:15,714
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,754 --> 00:00:21,990
Speaker 1: Tonight, we are talking about asynchronous play in games as opposed to synchronous play.

6
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:23,828
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:25,171 --> 00:00:30,190
Speaker 1: So, uh, I don't need to say, "Oh, I've been playing some Overwatch," because I'm pretty much always playing Overwatch.

8
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:43,170
Speaker 1: Like, if I'm actually at my computer playing a video game, I'm either playing a co-op game with, like, the Scotts, or I'm playing Overwatch, or I'm playing Hades, or I'm playing an asynchronous game like 18XX, but we'll get to that.

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:53,937
Speaker 1: But Overwatch now, they use their arcade, like, the non-competitive, non-ranked place you can go to just play a game, to try stuff out.

10
00:00:53,998 --> 00:00:55,589
Speaker 1: Like, they'll put weird modes in there.

11
00:00:56,391 --> 00:00:59,350
Speaker 1: And they kept putting all these different flavors of capture the flag.

12
00:01:00,271 --> 00:01:03,925
Speaker 1: Like, they're clearly trying to make capture the flag a thing.

13
00:01:03,965 --> 00:01:05,330
Speaker 1: I think I've even talked about this before.

14
00:01:05,851 --> 00:01:14,095
Speaker 1: Like, they know capture the flag, the sort of true genesis of the kind of genre of competitive FPS, that became Overwatch.

15
00:01:14,436 --> 00:01:16,624
Speaker 1: Like, the originator of that.

16
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,090
Speaker 1: They want to make that work.

17
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:29,013
Speaker 1: And I think they're actually getting close, because over the last couple years, those CTF modes have just gotten, like, more and more playable, and more and more interesting, and more and more good.

18
00:01:29,394 --> 00:01:38,285
Speaker 1: And now, in the arcade, instead of different types of capture the flag just, like, coming and going, now capture the flag is its own category.

19
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:45,463
Speaker 1: And in that category, it has two, like, arcade modes, and a ranked competitive mode.

20
00:01:47,188 --> 00:01:52,203
Speaker 1: I'm gonna start playing, more so than I've ever done competitive, like, regular Overwatch.

21
00:01:52,564 --> 00:01:58,506
Speaker 1: I'm gonna dive deep into competitive capture the flag, because that mode is my goddamn jam.

22
00:01:58,827 --> 00:01:59,510
Speaker 1: We'll see how that goes.

23
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:10,226
Speaker 0: - The thing about capture the flag as a whole, right, is that when you play capture the flag video game, tribes, something like that, right, it's like the flag is like,

24
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:11,149
Speaker 0: "Bruh-ver!"

25
00:02:11,249 --> 00:02:11,410
Speaker 0: Right?

26
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:12,595
Speaker 0: Or, you know, TF2.

27
00:02:12,655 --> 00:02:15,086
Speaker 0: It's like, there's the flag, or the briefcase, or whatever.

28
00:02:15,147 --> 00:02:16,774
Speaker 0: It's in this holy location.

29
00:02:16,794 --> 00:02:19,305
Speaker 1: - You want, like, old Counter-Strike, where you could hide the hostages.

30
00:02:19,325 --> 00:02:20,550
Speaker 0: - No, right.

31
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:26,010
Speaker 0: And, well, I mean, I'm saying it's about, you know, getting in there, past defenses, right?

32
00:02:26,331 --> 00:02:29,363
Speaker 0: Going fast, dodging, you know, killing enemies.

33
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:36,335
Speaker 1: - They almost all have the concept of, there's a midfield, there's, like, an offensive zone for either side, and then a defensive zone.

34
00:02:36,376 --> 00:02:37,320
Speaker 1: Very much like hockey.

35
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:44,804
Speaker 0: - In real life, in real life, like, that capture the flag is kinda boring, right?

36
00:02:44,924 --> 00:02:49,540
Speaker 0: In real life, the good capture the flag is, like, enormous, enormous woods.

37
00:02:49,761 --> 00:02:51,668
Speaker 0: You don't even know where the fucking flag is.

38
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,093
Speaker 0: It's almost, like, a hide-and-seek.

39
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,906
Speaker 0: It's very zoomed in, like, "You're hiding behind a tree," right?

40
00:02:56,946 --> 00:02:58,471
Speaker 0: That kind of thing.

41
00:02:58,552 --> 00:03:01,443
Speaker 0: And no video game does that capture the flag at all, ever.

42
00:03:01,463 --> 00:03:07,390
Speaker 1: - I think one reason for that is that, in a video game, that would probably be boring as shit and difficult to make competitive.

43
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,375
Speaker 0: - Yeah, obviously.

44
00:03:09,395 --> 00:03:12,090
Speaker 1: - I mean, even in real life, it's only fun because you're out in the woods.

45
00:03:13,632 --> 00:03:25,050
Speaker 0: - But the video game capture the flag comes from that experience, yet doesn't look like it, much in the same way that the JRPG comes from the D&D experience, and yet is nothing.

46
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:26,978
Speaker 1: - Oh, that's a good way to think about it.

47
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,131
Speaker 0: - It's like when they moved it over to video game, right?

48
00:03:30,151 --> 00:03:32,302
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh, this is really fun to do in real life.

49
00:03:32,342 --> 00:03:33,427
Speaker 0: Let's make a video game of

50
00:03:33,488 --> 00:03:33,548
Speaker 0: it.".

51
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:34,311
Speaker 1: Oops.

52
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:36,577
Speaker 1: - Actually, so think of this.

53
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:38,061
Speaker 1: Then we'll get into the news.

54
00:03:39,184 --> 00:04:03,828
Speaker 1: So, games like Among Us and Fall Guys, like, low-investment, like, massively social games, are really popular lately, for a what if you made a game that was capture the flag, but instead of, like, what you described, but instead of trying to make it, like, a supremely competitive, deep experience, kind of just crank it out at the Among Us/Fall Guys level, and make it massive.

55
00:04:03,869 --> 00:04:06,718
Speaker 1: Like, it just makes server 40 on 40.

56
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:10,911
Speaker 1: It's a giant, like, woods map, and people are sneaking around trying to get the flag.

57
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,915
Speaker 0: - I played a game like that.

58
00:04:12,015 --> 00:04:14,867
Speaker 0: I think it might somewhat still exist.

59
00:04:14,927 --> 00:04:17,336
Speaker 0: I played a game like that way back in the day.

60
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:20,065
Speaker 0: It was just a 2D overhead view.

61
00:04:20,086 --> 00:04:21,290
Speaker 0: You were in these little vehicles.

62
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:39,599
Speaker 0: They were kind of, like, it looked like UFOs, maybe, and it would be, like, three on three, and you had, like, a laser, and you had, like, a grenade kind of item, and you had a little health bar, and you would move real slow, and you would, you know, you had a team, and you tried to go around and get the flag and bring it back to your base.

63
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,523
Speaker 0: What was that game called?

64
00:04:40,544 --> 00:04:43,335
Speaker 1: - I don't know this game, but that sounds interesting.

65
00:04:43,355 --> 00:04:45,442
Speaker 0: - It was, like, a really tiny little game.

66
00:04:45,462 --> 00:05:01,963
Speaker 1: - But I've realized that, well, not realized, we've talked about, we've done panels about this concept before, Horse Remorse, but a game like Fall Guys can be very fun, and people get weird, like, really competitive about it, even if a lot of it ends up being pretty random.

67
00:05:02,665 --> 00:05:07,380
Speaker 1: So I feel like there's a way to make a slow, zoomed-in capture the flag.

68
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,186
Speaker 1: that's just massively multiplayer.

69
00:05:09,587 --> 00:05:14,610
Speaker 1: that would scratch a social itch, even if it wasn't the kind of competitive game that we normally tend to like.

70
00:05:16,151 --> 00:05:19,530
Speaker 1: I don't know, I feel like there's a space there, there's an unfilled niche.

71
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:38,631
Speaker 1: Anyway, and some news, we didn't talk about this when it happened, but I want to talk about it now, because it's been weighing heavy on my approaching 40 brow, but Counter-Strike, the game that we played from near its beginning, late last year.

72
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:42,566
Speaker 0: - It was called ARK, Attack Retrieve Capture, A-R-C.

73
00:05:42,586 --> 00:05:48,240
Speaker 1: - So we should make bark better, Attack Retrieve Capture, and there we go, that's our game.

74
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,570
Speaker 0: - Yeah, the game, you know.

75
00:05:50,591 --> 00:05:57,220
Speaker 1: - No, we call it bark, you're all dogs, you can only, wait, there's no map, it never shows you where the flag is.

76
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,447
Speaker 0: - Capture the bone.

77
00:05:58,467 --> 00:06:07,351
Speaker 1: - Yeah, but it's not like, Overwatch Capture the Flag, where like, it highlights like the flag, someone got your flag, it's fucking there, right there, go get 'em.

78
00:06:07,712 --> 00:06:18,414
Speaker 1: It's more like, someone's got your bone, you don't know where, and you can only see, like, other players can point at where they think it is, and you gotta like find them in the woods.

79
00:06:19,159 --> 00:06:19,300
Speaker 1: Anyway.

80
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,660
Speaker 0: - It still exists, it's now called Armor Critical, armorcritical.com.

81
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:33,856
Speaker 1: - Alright, so Counter-Strike on November 9th, last year, at the end of the year, turned officially 20 years old.

82
00:06:33,876 --> 00:06:35,120
Speaker 0: - Pokemon's older.

83
00:06:35,461 --> 00:06:44,931
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Pokemon has released a lot of single player experiences, and has a massively evolving culture of card games, video games.

84
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:48,171
Speaker 0: - Counter-Strike has released like three games, four games.

85
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:53,680
Speaker 1: - Counter-Strike has released Counter-Strike, slightly different Counter-Strike, and slightly differenter Counter-Strike.

86
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,589
Speaker 1: - Pretty much.

87
00:06:56,609 --> 00:07:13,980
Speaker 1: - All I want to say about that, is that it is a testament to the core game loop of Counter-Strike as a competitive team-based first person shooter, the sheer fucking longevity of this game with very few changes over the years.

88
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:22,105
Speaker 1: Like, it is fundamentally the same game now that it was 20 years ago when we were playing it on those beta servers.

89
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:24,539
Speaker 0: - Yeah, pretty much.

90
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:42,940
Speaker 1: But it's interesting to me how popular it still is, and how specifically it is still a, it was a viable esport before esports were really much of a thing, and it remains a significant and important competitive esport that people care about, and there's an ecosystem around it.

91
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,831
Speaker 0: - No, it was a skill, you know, a skill-based game.

92
00:07:45,871 --> 00:07:50,940
Speaker 0: There weren't that many, you know, games where skill was, you know, there's not luck in Counter-Strike, really.

93
00:07:55,161 --> 00:08:01,739
Speaker 1: So in some other news, so that Cyberpunk game had a lot of issues that I think we talked about.

94
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:02,961
Speaker 0: - Oh yeah.

95
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:11,400
Speaker 1: - But the company that made Cyberpunk had some issues that are very Cyberpunk adjacent just recently.

96
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,430
Speaker 0: - So it seems like they got hacked somehow.

97
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:29,898
Speaker 0: Some of their internal system was compromised by some unknown means, and someone took a lot of confidential information and data, supposedly, and threatened to release it, and the company basically just, you know, did.

98
00:08:29,938 --> 00:08:33,594
Speaker 0: what I guess is what you should do, assuming you're already in the shit, right?

99
00:08:33,614 --> 00:08:41,015
Speaker 0: It should have not happened, but they already fucked up, so they basically said, "Yeah, this happened.

100
00:08:41,397 --> 00:08:45,090
Speaker 0: No, we're not gonna be, you know, pay the ransom, right?

101
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:45,311
Speaker 0: Go to

102
00:08:45,351 --> 00:08:45,692
Speaker 0: hell.".

103
00:08:45,712 --> 00:08:52,202
Speaker 1: - Quote, "We will not give into these demands, nor negotiate with the actor, being aware that this may eventually lead to the release of compromised

104
00:08:52,242 --> 00:08:52,483
Speaker 1: data.".

105
00:08:52,503 --> 00:08:54,773
Speaker 0: - Yep, and then who knows?

106
00:08:54,834 --> 00:08:56,240
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll see some compromised data.

107
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,846
Speaker 1: - I'm pretty confident we will.

108
00:08:59,648 --> 00:09:07,169
Speaker 1: It seems like it was a combination of data stealing, data theft, coupled with straight-up just ransomware on their whole network.

109
00:09:08,753 --> 00:09:14,548
Speaker 1: The thing is, if any of you have ever, I've never encountered ransomware.

110
00:09:14,568 --> 00:09:22,791
Speaker 0: - I've never seen it in person because no computer that I'm near is so poorly secured that that's gonna happen.

111
00:09:22,811 --> 00:09:39,225
Speaker 1: - But the one thing I have seen when ransomware attacks have happened is that typically, if the person who, like, gets attacked pays the ransom, often the person they pay, instead of giving them the code, will just say, "Oh, so you actually want your data back.

112
00:09:39,527 --> 00:09:40,390
Speaker 1: Send me twice as much

113
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:40,651
Speaker 1: money.".

114
00:09:41,755 --> 00:09:44,307
Speaker 1: Like, there's no guarantee they're gonna give you the data back.

115
00:09:44,568 --> 00:09:58,364
Speaker 1: There are some hacker groups where they'll have, like, the verifiable hashes in the websites and the ways to, like, they really want to make it easy for you to pay them a small amount, but generally, these more independent actors tend to just continue to exploit you.

116
00:09:58,986 --> 00:10:00,330
Speaker 1: Like, if someone blackmails you.

117
00:10:00,792 --> 00:10:12,940
Speaker 1: If you pay someone who blackmails you money so that they stop blackmailing you, there's literally nothing that payment does to prevent them from just blackmailing you in the future, and it verifies for them that the blackmail's legit.

118
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:21,786
Speaker 0: - Right, and it's also, you know, you always see, like, the famous, you know, movie hostage scene, which is kind of fake-ish, right?

119
00:10:21,806 --> 00:10:24,213
Speaker 1: - "I want a helicopter and a

120
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:24,755
Speaker 1: pony.".

121
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:26,742
Speaker 0: - "I got a briefcase of money.

122
00:10:26,842 --> 00:10:28,670
Speaker 0: You got some person tied up, right?

123
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:30,738
Speaker 0: We come and put them in the middle and swap,

124
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:31,100
Speaker 0: right?".

125
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,803
Speaker 0: - "What do you

126
00:10:31,863 --> 00:10:32,064
Speaker 0: do?".

127
00:10:32,084 --> 00:10:33,871
Speaker 0: - "You show me the person.

128
00:10:33,931 --> 00:10:35,076
Speaker 0: I show you the case of money,

129
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:35,317
Speaker 0: right?".

130
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:43,080
Speaker 0: With these ransomware situations, it could be like, "Okay, I've up, you know, it's like, you give me money.

131
00:10:43,801 --> 00:10:45,104
Speaker 0: I tell you I've deleted the

132
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:45,444
Speaker 0: data.".

133
00:10:49,172 --> 00:10:50,295
Speaker 0: "Okay, it's deleted.

134
00:10:50,355 --> 00:10:50,655
Speaker 0: Trust

135
00:10:50,675 --> 00:10:50,796
Speaker 0: me.".

136
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:52,479
Speaker 1: - "Yeah, I did not upload a

137
00:10:52,519 --> 00:10:52,780
Speaker 1: torrent.".

138
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:02,534
Speaker 0: - Yeah, or it's like, it's like, what, how can you, it's like, you're basically just giving someone money to hope that that person is true to their word.

139
00:11:02,654 --> 00:11:04,581
Speaker 0: It's like, you're not buying anything, right?

140
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:06,147
Speaker 0: There's no guarantees or nothing.

141
00:11:06,187 --> 00:11:16,018
Speaker 0: How, in what way can you make that fair exchange where you know for certain that, you know, this is, that money has rescued the person somehow?

142
00:11:16,038 --> 00:11:17,725
Speaker 1: - But I do want to point out something else.

143
00:11:18,287 --> 00:11:26,929
Speaker 1: CD Projekt, for all the problems with that company, for all the problems with Cyberpunk, the one thing that they did right is they recovered fully from the.

144
00:11:33,922 --> 00:11:40,086
Speaker 1: If you lose data in a ransomware attack, that just means you fucked up real bad and didn't have any processes in place.

145
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:46,989
Speaker 0: - Yep, they didn't have, so their security at protecting their, you know, systems was bad, but they had backups.

146
00:11:47,009 --> 00:11:49,115
Speaker 1: - Backups are so important.

147
00:11:49,156 --> 00:11:56,421
Speaker 1: The funniest thing, though, is the hackers, the email they sent them was like, "But we understand that most likely, like, you'll recover this data for

148
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:56,862
Speaker 1: backups.".

149
00:11:56,902 --> 00:12:00,274
Speaker 1: Like, they knew that the ransomware wouldn't probably get them.

150
00:12:00,294 --> 00:12:02,241
Speaker 0: - Now, that's another situation, right?

151
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:05,475
Speaker 0: Let's say you were really bad, you didn't have your backups, right?

152
00:12:05,716 --> 00:12:08,587
Speaker 0: You really sucked and dropped the ball, right?

153
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:14,404
Speaker 0: So now when you pay the ransom, you're hoping to get your data back, right?

154
00:12:14,645 --> 00:12:20,645
Speaker 0: So they send you, like what, an encrypted file, and they say, "Yeah, your data's in that encrypted file, right?

155
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,254
Speaker 0: Pay us money and we'll send you the key to decrypt

156
00:12:23,314 --> 00:12:23,394
Speaker 0: it.".

157
00:12:23,836 --> 00:12:28,211
Speaker 0: You pay them money, and they go, "A," they just lol and don't do anything.

158
00:12:28,753 --> 00:12:31,141
Speaker 0: "B," they send you a key to decrypt it, it doesn't work.

159
00:12:31,624 --> 00:12:34,939
Speaker 0: "C," they send you a key to decrypt it, you decrypt it, and it's a text file that says,

160
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:35,120
Speaker 0: "Lol."

161
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,729
Speaker 0: Or a picture of a skull or something, right?

162
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:42,383
Speaker 0: It's just like, and you can't get your money back, you get a refund.

163
00:12:42,765 --> 00:12:43,889
Speaker 0: It's not Amazon.

164
00:12:43,909 --> 00:12:44,792
Speaker 1: - There's a lesson here.

165
00:12:44,832 --> 00:12:49,046
Speaker 1: that's very simple and applies to everything, including this impeachment trial that started today.

166
00:12:49,708 --> 00:12:57,614
Speaker 1: Never, ever negotiate with someone where you believe and have reason to believe that they will act in bad faith.

167
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,020
Speaker 1: There's literally no point.

168
00:12:59,301 --> 00:13:07,206
Speaker 1: Debating, negotiating, none of those things matter at all if the counterparty cannot be reasonably assumed to act in good faith.

169
00:13:07,226 --> 00:13:15,754
Speaker 0: - Right, if someone is acting in bad faith, the only thing, the only way that you can get them to do something that they don't want to do is by force.

170
00:13:15,774 --> 00:13:18,482
Speaker 1: - Force or collateral, which is just force.

171
00:13:18,503 --> 00:13:22,436
Speaker 0: - Force or just let them be, that's your other option.

172
00:13:22,817 --> 00:13:28,354
Speaker 0: Just like, ignore them, or if you can't force them to do something, you can't, right?

173
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:41,862
Speaker 0: Only with someone who is acting in good faith where their word has value, where they will do what they say to some extent, where they will listen to what you are saying to some extent is the only kind of person that you can engage with.

174
00:13:41,962 --> 00:13:58,275
Speaker 0: If someone is just gonna lie, gonna not do what they say, is saying things but that aren't what they actually believe, they're just saying stuff, they're just gonna do what they're gonna do, don't waste any time on that person, right?

175
00:13:58,315 --> 00:14:05,556
Speaker 0: Whether it's a ransomware person or just some jerk you met on the internet, just don't do it, it's not worth it.

176
00:14:05,576 --> 00:14:10,254
Speaker 1: - So there's some other news that I want to dwell on a little longer than those other two things.

177
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:15,952
Speaker 1: There was a game that came out, was coming out around the same time as Overwatch.

178
00:14:16,353 --> 00:14:20,425
Speaker 1: that had extremely superficial similarities to Overwatch.

179
00:14:20,927 --> 00:14:32,708
Speaker 1: If you didn't know anything about games and you watched trailers, you might have assumed they were similar in some way, even though they were actually as different as an FPS and a board game.

180
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,742
Speaker 1: But there was a game called Battleborn and there's a game called Overwatch.

181
00:14:39,264 --> 00:14:43,136
Speaker 1: Battleborn, if you're not aware, failed catastrophically.

182
00:14:43,277 --> 00:14:44,240
Speaker 1: No one played that game.

183
00:14:45,081 --> 00:14:50,051
Speaker 1: That game just went downhill so fast, like it was kind of amazing.

184
00:14:51,033 --> 00:15:16,749
Speaker 1: So 2K has announced recently, I think on January 31st, like in the last couple weeks, that after February 24th, 2020, which was a while ago, you can't like purchase stuff in the game anymore, on January 31st, which just happened a little while ago, the game servers will go down and at that time the game in its entirety will remain unplayable forever.

185
00:15:18,454 --> 00:15:19,817
Speaker 1: Single-player bugs doesn't matter.

186
00:15:20,098 --> 00:15:23,427
Speaker 1: The game itself to even launch it requires those servers to be up.

187
00:15:25,413 --> 00:15:26,998
Speaker 1: A little bit of a tribes 2 situation.

188
00:15:27,619 --> 00:15:42,200
Speaker 1: So there's a lot like this story, there's a lot going on and I think I want to highlight like all the different threads here because these are threads that you can pursue if you find them interesting that talk about like they speak to have greater truths in the game industry.

189
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:46,091
Speaker 1: Point number one, games moving to this online.

190
00:15:46,231 --> 00:15:51,025
Speaker 1: only requiring a server to function at all model is kind of a problem.

191
00:15:52,709 --> 00:15:58,945
Speaker 1: How do you preserve a game like Battleborn for like posterity if it's literally gone forever?

192
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:07,330
Speaker 1: If the client does not do anything anymore, it's not like there's any way to get the server to like run in a museum.

193
00:16:07,391 --> 00:16:08,275
Speaker 1: We know that doesn't work.

194
00:16:08,556 --> 00:16:10,142
Speaker 1: Copyright ensures that will never happen.

195
00:16:10,644 --> 00:16:13,372
Speaker 1: So basically this game just disappeared forever.

196
00:16:14,115 --> 00:16:21,482
Speaker 1: Even though this game was a competitive game, much like Overwatch, there really is not much of a single-player experience to speak of.

197
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:25,210
Speaker 1: The fact that you can't interact with it at all is trouble.

198
00:16:27,295 --> 00:16:42,235
Speaker 1: Two, a lot of people are trying to make an argument that Overwatch coming out at the same time is why Battleborn failed and I don't think that is even a remotely credible argument.

199
00:16:42,896 --> 00:16:45,463
Speaker 1: Overwatch was a competitive first-person shooter.

200
00:16:45,864 --> 00:16:49,556
Speaker 1: Overwatch shares a lot with games like Counter-Strike or Quake.

201
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:57,602
Speaker 1: The skill that game is testing is teamwork and clicking on heads and doing FPS stuff with a high degree of direct personal skill.

202
00:16:58,363 --> 00:17:02,652
Speaker 1: Battleborn is basically a MOBA, like straight up.

203
00:17:03,293 --> 00:17:09,571
Speaker 1: Individual skill at FPSing or third-person shooting wouldn't matter that much in that game.

204
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:17,335
Speaker 1: If I just compare Battleborn to any other game, it's really more like Risk of Rain or Risk of Rain 2.

205
00:17:17,335 --> 00:17:19,079
Speaker 0: I've never played it so I don't know.

206
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:38,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's basically Battleborn was a MOBA and my opinion on what happened is that a lot of game journalists, because the games had similar trailers and somewhat similar aesthetics like team-based shooter, they assumed that they were going after the same audiences.

207
00:17:39,442 --> 00:17:43,983
Speaker 1: But what appears to have happened is a ton of people started to play Overwatch when it came out and kept playing it.

208
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:50,830
Speaker 1: A ton of people started to play Battleborn when it came out from the numbers I found, but didn't keep playing it.

209
00:17:51,172 --> 00:18:02,072
Speaker 1: The situation was a ton of people tried Battleborn, didn't like it, and the player base dropped off catastrophically to the point that within a few months people couldn't even get like a single game going at most times.

210
00:18:02,755 --> 00:18:18,819
Speaker 0: So I think that's just a sign of, you know, something that we sort of know but people don't think about a lot is that there are some game companies, right, that are good at supporting their existing game.

211
00:18:18,859 --> 00:18:21,690
Speaker 0: They put a game out and then they take care of it, right?

212
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:35,861
Speaker 0: So whether they do a good job or a bad job, right, and they make bad decisions, but the point is is that even if they're negatively active, right, they're doing bad things but they're still doing stuff, like they're still working all the time.

213
00:18:35,901 --> 00:18:42,247
Speaker 0: They got a team, it's on the game, they got patches, they got news, you might hate all the patches, but they're working on it.

214
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,977
Speaker 1: Valve and Blizzard do this very well, right?

215
00:18:45,037 --> 00:18:52,829
Speaker 0: Valve, Blizzard, the League of Legends company, Riot, right, all the companies with the big successful online games, it's sort of a chicken egg, right?

216
00:18:52,909 --> 00:19:02,824
Speaker 0: It's like, oh, we have a successful multiplayer game, therefore we keep care of it, or our game became a successful online multiplayer game because we take care of it, who knows?

217
00:19:02,844 --> 00:19:04,188
Speaker 0: But

218
00:19:04,288 --> 00:19:04,609
Speaker 1: I do

219
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:28,227
Speaker 0: think that a Blizzard-like company, where you have this reputation of doing it over and over again on several different games, when you put out a new game, people trust that that's what it's going to be, that you're going to be taking care of it, and so then, therefore, that game can now build on the trust of the effort you put into your previous games, maintaining those services, right?

220
00:19:28,247 --> 00:19:30,293
Speaker 0: Whereas, who made Battleborn, right?

221
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:35,044
Speaker 1: - Well, 2K.

222
00:19:35,064 --> 00:19:49,731
Speaker 0: - Right, so what other online, do they have a history and a community engagement of making online multiplayer games and keeping them going and working on them the way that a PUBG does, right?

223
00:19:49,751 --> 00:19:54,531
Speaker 0: Or even a Fortnite, Fortnite, the best at it, probably, right?

224
00:19:54,551 --> 00:19:58,912
Speaker 1: - Probably, they'll just radically fuck up their game because that's the audience.

225
00:19:58,932 --> 00:20:02,945
Speaker 1: they're going after, like radical changes, right?

226
00:20:02,985 --> 00:20:06,520
Speaker 0: They keep going, Minecraft, they got people who just keep working on it, right?

227
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,900
Speaker 1: - Civilization VI just keeps getting kind of crazy updates.

228
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,931
Speaker 0: - Right, so did Battleborn die?

229
00:20:13,951 --> 00:20:20,740
Speaker 0: I haven't played it, I don't know anything about what went on with it, but did it die because no one took care of it, or did they take care of it and it just sucks?

230
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:23,029
Speaker 1: - So what I think happened there...

231
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:30,260
Speaker 0: - And now, if they make any more games, if they try to make them online games with the community, that their rep is like ruined.

232
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,520
Speaker 0: It's gonna be hard to get people to buy into the next one.

233
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:39,905
Speaker 1: - I feel like what actually happened here happened so early, like the game came out and lost its player base almost instantly.

234
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:44,803
Speaker 1: That implies a more fundamental dysfunction and a mismatch on who the game was targeted at.

235
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:50,407
Speaker 1: That's a situation where, like, Team Fortress 2, when that came out, we were both really excited about it.

236
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:57,477
Speaker 1: Like, I'd been waiting for that game, and when it first came out, I jumped in and I started playing it, and I was pretty disappointed.

237
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:58,280
Speaker 1: It wasn't what I wanted.

238
00:20:58,360 --> 00:20:58,943
Speaker 1: I didn't like it.

239
00:20:59,003 --> 00:21:00,791
Speaker 1: I kind of stopped playing it pretty quickly.

240
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:07,320
Speaker 1: That mismatch of expectation seems to be what happened here because the player base didn't, like, start strong and slowly decline.

241
00:21:07,461 --> 00:21:21,860
Speaker 1: It started strong and then, like, catastrophically and rapidly declined, implying that people who played it for the first time discovered that the core concept of the game was not something they enjoyed, or they expected it to be one thing and it ended up being something else.

242
00:21:23,381 --> 00:21:26,058
Speaker 0: I think what happened-- - I've never-- I don't think I've ever even seen the game.

243
00:21:26,078 --> 00:21:28,085
Speaker 0: I basically-- - We played it at a PAX!

244
00:21:29,107 --> 00:21:33,500
Speaker 1: I have a video of us sitting there, playing it, and talking about it.

245
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:36,171
Speaker 0: - I don't think we played-- if we did, I don't remember it.

246
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:37,195
Speaker 0: - We played one match.

247
00:21:37,477 --> 00:21:39,526
Speaker 1: I was bitching the whole time because I couldn't invert the mouse.

248
00:21:39,546 --> 00:21:41,697
Speaker 0: - I do not remember this at all.

249
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,485
Speaker 0: I just know that there is a game-- - How do you not remember this?

250
00:21:43,706 --> 00:21:44,490
Speaker 1: Do I have to, like, get the video?

251
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,560
Speaker 0: - I just know that there is a game called Battleborn.

252
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:47,303
Speaker 0: That's all I know.

253
00:21:47,926 --> 00:21:50,396
Speaker 0: Until the news that it was gone.

254
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,440
Speaker 1: - Here's what I think happened.

255
00:21:52,640 --> 00:22:16,312
Speaker 1: Games journalists superficially kept comparing it to Overwatch, so players thought that they would be equivalent games, so I get the impression that the Overwatch-- people who were playing Overwatch or would play Overwatch, people who like a competitive first-person shooter, thought that Battleborn would be some sort of first-person or third-person competitive shooter, but when they got into it, despite what it looked like, it was a MOBA.

256
00:22:17,095 --> 00:22:23,756
Speaker 1: Generally, the kind of person who plays a first-person shooter, competitively, is not equally enthused about a MOBA.

257
00:22:23,816 --> 00:22:29,040
Speaker 1: Like, they target-- while there's a lot of overlap, they do target fundamentally different game experiences.

258
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:38,080
Speaker 1: I think people expected it to be more of a first-person/third-person shooter, and when they tried it, it was a very different kind of game, and that's why they bounced off of it so hard.

259
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:43,414
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, Battleborn didn't do a good job of getting the word out that, "Yo, this is a MOBA.

260
00:22:43,454 --> 00:22:43,916
Speaker 1: MOBA.

261
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:46,863
Speaker 1: Not shooter.

262
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:47,505
Speaker 1: Trust

263
00:22:47,646 --> 00:22:47,766
Speaker 1: us.".

264
00:22:48,368 --> 00:22:59,180
Speaker 1: So the people who would have liked it probably didn't try it out early, and by the time they might have corrected that message for those people to try it, the game had already declined so far that it didn't have critical mass to keep going.

265
00:22:59,741 --> 00:23:01,917
Speaker 1: I don't think any amount of changes to the game would have saved it.

266
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:13,869
Speaker 1: So, I guess one of those threads there is, be wary if you're a game designer or a game publisher, especially the bigger you are.

267
00:23:13,889 --> 00:23:29,563
Speaker 1: You have to make it very clear to the people out there who you want to play your game what the game is and who it's for, because if you don't make that crystal clear, lazy game journalists might tell people your game is something different from what it is, and that might destroy you.

268
00:23:32,408 --> 00:23:38,198
Speaker 1: So last, this kind of news happens a lot.

269
00:23:38,639 --> 00:23:39,782
Speaker 1: This is just the most recent one.

270
00:23:39,822 --> 00:23:40,886
Speaker 1: It's kind of a big deal one.

271
00:23:41,669 --> 00:24:00,720
Speaker 1: Gearbox, who you may know from Developing Borderlands, was just bought for 1.3 billion dollars by Embracer Group, which is just one more step in the massive consolidation of developers and publishers in the games industry.

272
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:06,282
Speaker 1: I expect eventually every single game made above like indies is going to be just one giant conglomerate.

273
00:24:06,302 --> 00:24:11,046
Speaker 0: I think the entertainment, you know, the major entertainment industry as a whole just keeps consolidating.

274
00:24:11,086 --> 00:24:13,056
Speaker 0: It's like, I'm surprised there isn't already just one.

275
00:24:13,096 --> 00:24:14,422
Speaker 0: It's like Disney's close, right?

276
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:17,191
Speaker 0: But it's like, wow, there's still more than one company.

277
00:24:17,272 --> 00:24:21,003
Speaker 1: CVS Paramount, like Paramount Plus, they're really trying to make that a thing.

278
00:24:22,848 --> 00:24:34,041
Speaker 1: But the problem they have is how many people out there, like the mass market, think like could list things that Paramount owns the IP to as opposed to another brand?

279
00:24:34,262 --> 00:24:35,566
Speaker 1: Like who knows that?

280
00:24:35,606 --> 00:24:37,492
Speaker 1: Who's not already a nerd about this stuff?

281
00:24:39,177 --> 00:24:41,925
Speaker 0: They, you know, they try to teach people what they're marketing.

282
00:24:41,966 --> 00:24:43,671
Speaker 0: That's what that job is.

283
00:24:44,294 --> 00:24:46,601
Speaker 0: So, but yeah, so Gearbox got bought.

284
00:24:47,363 --> 00:24:54,986
Speaker 0: So this is interesting because, you know, it's, you know, it's been already so much conglomeration going on.

285
00:24:55,608 --> 00:25:04,176
Speaker 0: And there's so much, you know, so many different industry ties in terms of, you know, this, this company is the developer and that company is the publisher.

286
00:25:04,236 --> 00:25:14,031
Speaker 1: Some publishers are developers, some developers are publishers, some publishers own developers, but also have their own developer companies and some publishers own publishers.

287
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:18,146
Speaker 0: Like some publishers and or developers have IP licenses.

288
00:25:18,206 --> 00:25:20,755
Speaker 0: Some of them own the rights to IP, right?

289
00:25:20,856 --> 00:25:23,384
Speaker 0: It's like, there's all kinds of weird things going on, right?

290
00:25:23,404 --> 00:25:26,252
Speaker 0: So it's like the developers of Pokemon.

291
00:25:26,372 --> 00:25:27,415
Speaker 0: is Game Freak, right?

292
00:25:28,418 --> 00:25:30,225
Speaker 0: Is Game Freak just owned by Nintendo?

293
00:25:30,426 --> 00:25:31,329
Speaker 0: It's like, I think it is.

294
00:25:31,731 --> 00:25:32,534
Speaker 0: Do you know for sure?

295
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:33,840
Speaker 0: What exactly is that relationship?

296
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,494
Speaker 0: Who, oh, there's a, there's a company called the Pokemon company.

297
00:25:36,514 --> 00:25:37,380
Speaker 0: What the fuck do they own?

298
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:37,801
Speaker 0: Yeah.

299
00:25:38,102 --> 00:25:38,404
Speaker 0: Right.

300
00:25:38,444 --> 00:25:41,696
Speaker 1: It's like, it's like, what if you're not in the industry, like?

301
00:25:42,177 --> 00:25:48,947
Speaker 1: I would struggle without looking it up again, just to be crystal clear, especially when there's like joint ownership or like stock swaps.

302
00:25:49,107 --> 00:25:50,693
Speaker 1: Like there's lots of nonsense that can happen.

303
00:25:51,115 --> 00:25:55,688
Speaker 1: The exact relationship between Gearbox, Take-Two, 2k and THQ Nordic, like.

304
00:25:56,410 --> 00:26:03,536
Speaker 1: summarize that quickly or Google around and count the time it takes for you to be able to summarize that succinctly.

305
00:26:03,617 --> 00:26:05,183
Speaker 1: It'll take you longer than you might expect.

306
00:26:06,006 --> 00:26:06,247
Speaker 0: Yeah.

307
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:10,381
Speaker 0: It's like Super Smash Brothers was made by HAL Laboratory until 2001.

308
00:26:10,381 --> 00:26:17,943
Speaker 0: And then starting in 2008, it was made by Sora Limited and from 2014 to now it was made by Bandai Namco Studios.

309
00:26:18,404 --> 00:26:19,748
Speaker 0: It's like, wait, what?

310
00:26:20,129 --> 00:26:22,556
Speaker 0: Nintendo isn't making Smash.

311
00:26:22,576 --> 00:26:23,840
Speaker 0: Someone else is making Smash.

312
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,486
Speaker 0: Nintendo publishes it and owns.

313
00:26:25,827 --> 00:26:31,700
Speaker 1: When you said Bandai, like I just realized something pretty, like, I don't think this is necessarily profound, but it stood out in my brain.

314
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:47,899
Speaker 1: Whenever we were kids, like we were young and the AOL Time and Warner were all merged together into AOL Time Warner, how utterly alien and like fake that name sounded when it first appeared.

315
00:26:47,979 --> 00:26:52,470
Speaker 1: Like saying the words AOL Time Warner seemed ludicrous.

316
00:26:53,012 --> 00:26:57,164
Speaker 0: And yet now even at the time it seemed like that shouldn't be legal.

317
00:26:57,264 --> 00:26:58,551
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be able to, right.

318
00:26:58,631 --> 00:27:00,279
Speaker 0: And now it's even worse than that.

319
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:02,529
Speaker 1: The difference is now we're used to that.

320
00:27:02,629 --> 00:27:07,049
Speaker 1: I'll say like Bandai Namco and literally not even bad and I'll string together 10 proper nouns.

321
00:27:07,089 --> 00:27:10,745
Speaker 0: NBC, Comcast, who knows what the hell that company is now, right?

322
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:11,247
Speaker 1: Right.

323
00:27:11,467 --> 00:27:17,151
Speaker 1: But that like word salad of a bunch of proper nouns that got merged doesn't, like it just rolls off the tongue now.

324
00:27:17,211 --> 00:27:18,317
Speaker 1: Like we're just used to that.

325
00:27:18,357 --> 00:27:19,140
Speaker 1: That's business as usual.

326
00:27:19,160 --> 00:27:20,645
Speaker 0: But anyway, it's bad.

327
00:27:21,327 --> 00:27:32,204
Speaker 0: But yeah, so the Gearbox got bought by some giant equity group that owns a fuck ton of stuff, but some of their stuff is published by other companies that are not purchased.

328
00:27:32,706 --> 00:27:36,740
Speaker 0: And so there's still the, now those relationships get kind of questionable, right?

329
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,187
Speaker 0: Are they going to maintain them?

330
00:27:38,207 --> 00:27:50,280
Speaker 0: And you know, like for, it always reminds me of like what happens in the comic book world where like when Disney bought Marvel, because it was like there were other comic book companies, for example, until then Dark Horse did all the Star Wars comics.

331
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,223
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

332
00:27:51,885 --> 00:27:59,452
Speaker 0: And then when Disney bought Marvel, they basically waited until the license expired and they said, okay, Dark Horse, you kept making Star Wars comics.

333
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:02,383
Speaker 0: Your license is up and now Marvel will make the Star Wars.

334
00:28:02,484 --> 00:28:06,984
Speaker 1: Actually, total aside, but with WandaVision, we talked about that last week on Wednesday a little bit.

335
00:28:07,004 --> 00:28:08,290
Speaker 0: Is there Star Wars in WandaVision?

336
00:28:08,491 --> 00:28:12,623
Speaker 1: No, but I realized, how the fuck are you going to do House of M if you don't have the X-Men?

337
00:28:12,643 --> 00:28:19,778
Speaker 0: They just do, you know, they never keep it true to the book, right?

338
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:21,609
Speaker 0: If they kept it true to the book, I'd probably want to watch it.

339
00:28:22,572 --> 00:28:25,730
Speaker 1: If it was like House of M with the X-Men, I would be even more interested.

340
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:37,282
Speaker 1: But like this article about this actually even like there's a few sentences here because nerds, like the fans, they don't care about the industry consolidation.

341
00:28:37,543 --> 00:28:45,676
Speaker 1: The only thing anyone who plays games seems to care about is what's going to happen to Borderlands because they don't know or care all these companies involved.

342
00:28:45,696 --> 00:28:46,339
Speaker 1: You know what they know?

343
00:28:46,661 --> 00:28:54,093
Speaker 1: They like Borderlands and they want another Borderlands to come and they don't want the next Borderlands to be bad because it was made by someone different.

344
00:28:54,434 --> 00:28:55,378
Speaker 1: That's all they care about.

345
00:28:55,820 --> 00:29:07,555
Speaker 1: So all these press releases are mostly spending a lot of time reassuring fans of the Borderlands IP that the Borderlands IP is fine, but the way they said it is kind of funny.

346
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:12,671
Speaker 1: They said, quote, "We love our relationship with Take-Two and the 2K games

347
00:29:12,691 --> 00:29:12,792
Speaker 1: label.".

348
00:29:12,812 --> 00:29:14,800
Speaker 0: It's the same political language everyone uses.

349
00:29:15,102 --> 00:29:18,094
Speaker 0: It's like a copypasta for merging and buying companies.

350
00:29:18,114 --> 00:29:19,219
Speaker 1: The second one's better.

351
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:25,078
Speaker 1: Quote, "A relationship with Take-Two where we've agreed on certain rights for exploitation of the

352
00:29:25,219 --> 00:29:25,620
Speaker 1: IP.".

353
00:29:26,001 --> 00:29:27,746
Speaker 1: The IP is a gearbox IP.

354
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:30,895
Speaker 1: They frame it in terms of the exploitation of the IP.

355
00:29:30,915 --> 00:29:32,641
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what it is.

356
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:38,707
Speaker 1: That is what it is, but I don't usually see press releases using that terminology when they're aimed at the actual consumers.

357
00:29:38,767 --> 00:29:40,634
Speaker 0: I mean, at work, that's the language we use all the time.

358
00:29:40,654 --> 00:29:41,578
Speaker 1: That's the word I use at work.

359
00:29:41,598 --> 00:29:45,592
Speaker 1: Where was the copyright exploited?

360
00:29:46,114 --> 00:29:48,380
Speaker 0: Where's the exploitation territory, et cetera.

361
00:29:49,382 --> 00:29:57,625
Speaker 1: So, pretty sure the end result of this for gamers who like Borderlands is that literally nothing will change at all.

362
00:29:58,527 --> 00:30:07,884
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, so, you know, anytime any company buys another company, they always say to the employees, especially, but also everyone else, "Nothing will change.

363
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:09,512
Speaker 0: You're just going to carry on business as usual.

364
00:30:09,552 --> 00:30:10,094
Speaker 0: We just bought

365
00:30:10,114 --> 00:30:10,315
Speaker 0: this.".

366
00:30:10,416 --> 00:30:12,384
Speaker 0: And it is 100% always a lie.

367
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:20,878
Speaker 0: You don't buy something because you don't want to... It's like, "Yes, I want to buy that house and never live in it and not jack up the rent or do anything.

368
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:22,264
Speaker 0: I just wanted to... Now I'm the owner.

369
00:30:22,325 --> 00:30:22,827
Speaker 0: Nothing else is

370
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:23,088
Speaker 0: changing.".

371
00:30:23,108 --> 00:30:24,334
Speaker 1: But people literally do that.

372
00:30:24,395 --> 00:30:25,380
Speaker 1: Pita tears are a thing.

373
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,490
Speaker 1: That's like a big chunk of the real estate in New York.

374
00:30:27,790 --> 00:30:29,397
Speaker 1: It's purely a place to park money.

375
00:30:30,220 --> 00:30:34,460
Speaker 0: But I'm saying you're making a... The point is even if you're parking money, you're making a change, right?

376
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:36,852
Speaker 0: It was previously this and now it's something different.

377
00:30:36,912 --> 00:30:38,259
Speaker 0: It wasn't, you know, previously.

378
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:40,932
Speaker 0: one person's money park and now a new person's money park.

379
00:30:41,434 --> 00:30:43,042
Speaker 1: Well, for pita tears, it usually is.

380
00:30:43,183 --> 00:30:44,670
Speaker 1: Very few people live in those apartments.

381
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:52,739
Speaker 0: But I'm just saying is that you don't buy a thing because you don't... It's like you don't go to the Best Buy and buy something and leave it at the Best Buy unopened.

382
00:30:54,985 --> 00:30:56,208
Speaker 0: Okay, right?

383
00:30:56,449 --> 00:30:58,558
Speaker 0: When you buy something, you're going to do something to it.

384
00:30:58,638 --> 00:31:01,230
Speaker 0: So, never leave anyone who says, "Nothing will

385
00:31:01,250 --> 00:31:01,571
Speaker 0: change.".

386
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:03,841
Speaker 0: Something will change, but who knows what.

387
00:31:04,122 --> 00:31:12,913
Speaker 1: Sometimes you buy something that is printing a small amount of money and you just unplug it, take it home, plug it in, and ask it to keep printing that money for you.

388
00:31:14,538 --> 00:31:16,404
Speaker 1: Anyway, and it could be a situation like that.

389
00:31:16,985 --> 00:31:21,240
Speaker 1: Lionsgate is involved because of exploitation of like the live action move.

390
00:31:21,521 --> 00:31:29,408
Speaker 1: They're like, "Read this article and I dare you to draw a Charlie Day yarn map of all the companies involved in this Borderlands

391
00:31:29,448 --> 00:31:29,950
Speaker 1: situation.".

392
00:31:35,811 --> 00:31:38,998
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

393
00:31:39,359 --> 00:31:41,043
Speaker 1: So, check this out.

394
00:31:41,564 --> 00:31:43,168
Speaker 1: I'm a big fan of speed runs.

395
00:31:43,188 --> 00:31:54,242
Speaker 1: Like, I don't watch video game streamers like at all, but I watch a lot of videos that go in depth on speed running like technique and the history of speed running records, etc.

396
00:31:54,764 --> 00:32:01,770
Speaker 1: And this one is a really good explanation of one of the weirder kinds of speed runs or one of the weirder kinds of techniques.

397
00:32:02,292 --> 00:32:15,218
Speaker 1: Because when people speed run, both real time and TAS, there's certain types of techniques, certain types of exploits, certain types of like frame timing and sub pixels that like exist in multiple games and people become experts at these things.

398
00:32:16,020 --> 00:32:24,525
Speaker 1: One of those techniques literally involves fucking with the hardware and there's a lot of discourse on where the line is.

399
00:32:25,387 --> 00:32:32,970
Speaker 1: Like, on the N64, is it okay to open the cartridge and push your finger hard on the chip while you're playing?

400
00:32:33,830 --> 00:32:37,729
Speaker 1: Is it okay to break an NES controller so you get it left and right at the same time?

401
00:32:38,551 --> 00:32:43,363
Speaker 1: Is it okay to put your NES on a hot plate while you play?

402
00:32:43,805 --> 00:32:49,825
Speaker 1: Because that is the speed running technique that lets you get faster times in Dragon Quest 3.

403
00:32:49,825 --> 00:32:56,610
Speaker 1: Putting your physical console on a hot plate and heating it to a particular temperature while you play the game.

404
00:32:57,851 --> 00:33:09,710
Speaker 0: I would say that the hot plate technique would be allowed if there was someone on Earth, right, who basically it was naturally that temperature in their home, right?

405
00:33:10,671 --> 00:33:12,429
Speaker 1: Oh, I could plausibly say that the NES.

406
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:19,818
Speaker 0: Right, because like it's like okay so-and-so lives on a tropical island and it's, you know, the sun is directly overhead.

407
00:33:19,858 --> 00:33:20,742
Speaker 0: It's that time of the year.

408
00:33:20,782 --> 00:33:21,686
Speaker 0: It's 100 degrees.

409
00:33:21,706 --> 00:33:24,194
Speaker 0: It's like, well, the air is 100 degrees.

410
00:33:24,234 --> 00:33:25,619
Speaker 0: The NES somehow still works.

411
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:28,628
Speaker 0: So I live in Norway.

412
00:33:28,969 --> 00:33:30,915
Speaker 0: I'm going to heat up my NES to 100 degrees.

413
00:33:31,256 --> 00:33:32,039
Speaker 1: Yep, so it's fair.

414
00:33:32,119 --> 00:33:34,427
Speaker 1: I have the same situation as that nerd.

415
00:33:35,189 --> 00:33:35,350
Speaker 0: Right.

416
00:33:35,490 --> 00:33:41,296
Speaker 0: If you're heating it up like unnaturally, it's like, well, I might as well just play in an emulator and save state, right?

417
00:33:41,337 --> 00:33:44,428
Speaker 0: You're modifying the capabilities of the equipment, right?

418
00:33:45,453 --> 00:33:47,870
Speaker 0: Yep, but I would say that is not okay.

419
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:59,210
Speaker 1: This video explains in enough detail exactly how and why this works for one particular game and it is fascinating and also pretty straightforward.

420
00:34:01,591 --> 00:34:18,130
Speaker 0: So anyway, so one of our favorite games that we, board games that we have played the most is Puerto Rico and we often point out how while mechanically this game is amazing and uh, Euro games, however, you know, it's, it's like the pinnacle of Euro games.

421
00:34:18,771 --> 00:34:22,542
Speaker 0: Uh, the theme of Euro games is often very loosely applied.

422
00:34:22,763 --> 00:34:23,083
Speaker 1: Yep.

423
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:32,889
Speaker 0: Uh, and in Puerto Rico, the theme of the game is colonization slavery, even though it doesn't use the word slaves in it.

424
00:34:33,731 --> 00:34:45,783
Speaker 0: Uh, you are literally taking little wooden Brown discs off of a boat that are specifically in the though many other pieces are not called out by their color.

425
00:34:46,043 --> 00:34:46,947
Speaker 1: that bothered me then.

426
00:34:47,007 --> 00:34:48,813
Speaker 1: And it bothers me now, right?

427
00:34:48,855 --> 00:34:51,704
Speaker 0: They're called colonists, but they show up on a boat.

428
00:34:52,145 --> 00:34:54,574
Speaker 0: The more demand there is for them, the more show up.

429
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:55,600
Speaker 0: They don't cost anything.

430
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,311
Speaker 0: The mayor just distributes them evenly to everybody.

431
00:34:59,274 --> 00:35:07,233
Speaker 0: Um, and your plantations and your buildings don't function unless you put colonists in them.

432
00:35:07,975 --> 00:35:15,862
Speaker 0: And there's an expansion that adds different buildings that require, you know, nobles implying that the colonists are somehow not noble.

433
00:35:15,922 --> 00:35:16,203
Speaker 0: Right.

434
00:35:16,845 --> 00:35:29,423
Speaker 0: Anyway, so it's obviously slavery, even though the game, uh, doesn't say slavery or mention anything about it, it's just sort of there, you know, it's, you know, it's not great.

435
00:35:30,005 --> 00:35:39,018
Speaker 1: And so many Euro games, especially from the nineties and early two thousands, like they all, almost all of them just use European colonialism as their default theme.

436
00:35:39,900 --> 00:35:40,362
Speaker 0: Yep.

437
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:45,538
Speaker 0: It's very common theme in a lot of games, especially, you know, from the two thousands anyway.

438
00:35:46,281 --> 00:35:53,670
Speaker 0: So here, this person made this amazing video that I think anyone who board games, especially Euro games, uh, should watch.

439
00:35:54,472 --> 00:35:59,026
Speaker 0: And basically the video, the video is how slavery is presented in board games.

440
00:35:59,186 --> 00:36:14,707
Speaker 0: And obviously Puerto Rico features prominently, but they go in depth examining several games and tabletop games overall of, uh, the different ways that slavery is represented both good and not good.

441
00:36:15,068 --> 00:36:15,209
Speaker 0: Right.

442
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:19,283
Speaker 0: Cause there are games that represent slavery is like, it's in the game.

443
00:36:19,625 --> 00:36:20,307
Speaker 0: Here it is.

444
00:36:20,568 --> 00:36:21,130
Speaker 0: It's slavery.

445
00:36:21,371 --> 00:36:23,058
Speaker 0: Oh, and it's bad by the way, right.

446
00:36:23,078 --> 00:36:27,997
Speaker 0: We're teaching, you know, it's, it's a proper, well done, correct educational game.

447
00:36:28,057 --> 00:36:29,723
Speaker 0: Like, yeah, slaves are bad.

448
00:36:29,743 --> 00:36:34,058
Speaker 0: And there are other games where it's like, yeah, I have slaves.

449
00:36:34,118 --> 00:36:35,061
Speaker 0: It helps you win.

450
00:36:35,142 --> 00:36:36,266
Speaker 0: It's like, that's not so great.

451
00:36:36,286 --> 00:36:41,404
Speaker 1: There's this fantastic, like early on in the, in the video, he puts up this chart.

452
00:36:41,565 --> 00:36:43,873
Speaker 1: that is like a really good way to describe this problem.

453
00:36:44,154 --> 00:36:47,125
Speaker 1: It's a two dimensional chart where you can plot a game.

454
00:36:47,727 --> 00:36:49,473
Speaker 1: One axis is on the top.

455
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,178
Speaker 1: Slavery is negative.

456
00:36:51,218 --> 00:36:55,010
Speaker 1: Like in the game, slavery is like shown to be a negative thing.

457
00:36:55,491 --> 00:36:58,640
Speaker 1: And at the bottom playing slavery is rewarded.

458
00:36:58,981 --> 00:37:03,455
Speaker 1: Like if you exploit slaves in the game, you're rewarded mechanically.

459
00:37:03,616 --> 00:37:04,399
Speaker 1: That's one axis.

460
00:37:04,419 --> 00:37:09,318
Speaker 1: And the other axis is on one side, the game says it's about slavery.

461
00:37:09,719 --> 00:37:12,270
Speaker 1: And on the other side, the game never acknowledges slavery.

462
00:37:12,570 --> 00:37:17,050
Speaker 1: And Puerto Rico is just in the, like the furthest bottom left of this fucking chart.

463
00:37:18,191 --> 00:37:19,856
Speaker 0: Pretty much so.

464
00:37:19,876 --> 00:37:20,116
Speaker 0: Yeah.

465
00:37:20,678 --> 00:37:23,405
Speaker 0: Uh, I think this is like necessary viewing.

466
00:37:23,586 --> 00:37:33,392
Speaker 0: And also if you are making games, uh, don't make your game theme fucking slavery, unless you are, you know, an expert on slavery

467
00:37:33,633 --> 00:37:56,281
Speaker 1: and do not mechanically reward players like, like games like, uh, you know, we always talk about John company or an infamous traffic because those games are a better like historical exploration of this fucked up situation as opposed to Puerto Rico, which is do these things and you will win in the meta moment.

468
00:37:56,301 --> 00:38:01,513
Speaker 1: I, uh, I'm leaning toward reading that book, but I have not yet continued it.

469
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:02,657
Speaker 0: Nope.

470
00:38:02,999 --> 00:38:05,950
Speaker 0: Cause I plan we've been, we've been that way for about a month or two now.

471
00:38:06,171 --> 00:38:06,351
Speaker 0: Yeah.

472
00:38:06,753 --> 00:38:06,974
Speaker 1: Yep.

473
00:38:07,395 --> 00:38:09,222
Speaker 1: So, uh, we'll just stay in that steady state.

474
00:38:09,884 --> 00:38:12,897
Speaker 1: Uh, otherwise we don't really have any online cons coming up for a while.

475
00:38:13,298 --> 00:38:16,713
Speaker 1: Pretty sure they're not going to be any cons in person for a long while to come.

476
00:38:17,195 --> 00:38:18,862
Speaker 1: So we're just stuck inside doing our thing.

477
00:38:18,882 --> 00:38:21,955
Speaker 1: Uh, I don't know what other meta bits we have right now.

478
00:38:21,995 --> 00:38:26,695
Speaker 1: Our forums are rocking or discords rocking, uh, every now and then we live stream some games.

479
00:38:27,197 --> 00:38:29,889
Speaker 1: I'm going to start playing overwatch CTF pretty competitively.

480
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:35,010
Speaker 1: So if anyone's good at that mode and wants to join up with me, maybe we can, uh, hit that platinum.

481
00:38:38,591 --> 00:38:39,234
Speaker 1: That's all I got.

482
00:38:39,294 --> 00:38:40,097
Speaker 1: I got nothing going on.

483
00:38:40,841 --> 00:38:41,805
Speaker 0: There is nothing going on.

484
00:38:41,885 --> 00:38:44,375
Speaker 0: It's, uh, you know, we're waiting for the sun to come back.

485
00:38:44,576 --> 00:38:44,837
Speaker 1: Yep.

486
00:38:45,761 --> 00:38:50,917
Speaker 1: Both the literal sun and just a post COVID world, or at least a mitigated COVID world at this point.

487
00:38:51,819 --> 00:38:52,320
Speaker 0: Pretty much.

488
00:38:53,002 --> 00:39:08,873
Speaker 1: So in our current COVID dystopian nightmare, one thing that has kept a lot of people going is the fact that even though we can't play games in person with our friends and loved ones, we can play games online with our friends and loved ones.

489
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:15,612
Speaker 1: But it is despite the fact that no one can go anywhere and everyone's stuck at home.

490
00:39:16,234 --> 00:39:28,449
Speaker 1: It is still for reasons that we've talked about in panels in the past, shockingly hard to get a critical mass of an adult's friends together to play a game online at the same time.

491
00:39:29,232 --> 00:39:33,064
Speaker 0: People, uh, you're guilty by the way, I am guilty than I am.

492
00:39:33,084 --> 00:39:33,525
Speaker 0: Right.

493
00:39:33,565 --> 00:39:37,175
Speaker 0: As people don't prioritize, uh, gaming, right.

494
00:39:37,216 --> 00:39:40,632
Speaker 0: People have this vision in their mind, especially nerds at least who like games.

495
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:41,354
Speaker 0: Right.

496
00:39:41,435 --> 00:39:42,920
Speaker 0: And they think in their mind, man.

497
00:39:42,941 --> 00:39:43,021
Speaker 0: Yeah.

498
00:39:43,442 --> 00:39:49,225
Speaker 0: It would be so awesome if we just like played, you know, I really want to play samurai sword slash Shogun slash Yakuza.

499
00:39:49,607 --> 00:39:50,009
Speaker 0: Yeah.

500
00:39:50,029 --> 00:39:51,774
Speaker 0: I really want to play some battle tech.

501
00:39:51,814 --> 00:39:51,974
Speaker 0: Yeah.

502
00:39:52,034 --> 00:39:52,837
Speaker 0: I really want you.

503
00:39:52,937 --> 00:40:00,299
Speaker 0: You imagine doing it and you want to wake your ass up at 9.

504
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:00,480
Speaker 0: Right.

505
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:01,966
Speaker 0: Don't do anything else that day.

506
00:40:01,986 --> 00:40:04,895
Speaker 0: Get to your computer, get in the discord chat, right?

507
00:40:05,036 --> 00:40:09,372
Speaker 0: Get your TTS loaded, set all your stuff up and we'll fucking do it.

508
00:40:09,492 --> 00:40:11,221
Speaker 0: And it's like, then people don't actually do it.

509
00:40:11,382 --> 00:40:14,475
Speaker 1: But even in pre-covid times, like, oh, I have to go to a wedding.

510
00:40:14,736 --> 00:40:16,603
Speaker 1: My son has to go to the hospital.

511
00:40:16,623 --> 00:40:18,369
Speaker 0: You don't have to do that stuff now.

512
00:40:19,751 --> 00:40:20,253
Speaker 1: Yup.

513
00:40:20,273 --> 00:40:21,638
Speaker 0: You're stuck inside doing nothing.

514
00:40:21,698 --> 00:40:21,919
Speaker 0: Right.

515
00:40:21,959 --> 00:40:24,429
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, get your ass up and do it.

516
00:40:24,870 --> 00:40:25,473
Speaker 0: Make it happen.

517
00:40:25,895 --> 00:40:26,739
Speaker 0: Nothing's stopping you.

518
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,134
Speaker 1: Except doing other things, working on geek night stuff in some cases.

519
00:40:31,458 --> 00:40:31,639
Speaker 0: Yeah.

520
00:40:31,679 --> 00:40:34,329
Speaker 0: If you're into the game will not happen unless you make it a priority.

521
00:40:34,349 --> 00:40:36,478
Speaker 0: You have to put it ahead of the other things.

522
00:40:36,498 --> 00:40:44,069
Speaker 0: You have to say when those other things come up, you have to, you know, like, oh, I was gonna, I don't know, go, you know, run or something.

523
00:40:44,089 --> 00:40:44,952
Speaker 0: You gotta be like, nope.

524
00:40:44,972 --> 00:40:46,778
Speaker 0: Um, I prioritized gaming.

525
00:40:46,839 --> 00:40:48,826
Speaker 0: I will not do the running or whatever.

526
00:40:48,966 --> 00:40:53,326
Speaker 1: As anyone who sees me at PAX has noticed, especially some of you have said hi to me at PAX Souths in the past.

527
00:40:53,346 --> 00:41:05,717
Speaker 1: Cause that's the pax where it's, I'm the most visible doing it, but I get up in a run like every morning during any gaming con we go to, uh, I actually do prioritize running over gaming and I pretty much why you're not fucking gaming.

528
00:41:05,978 --> 00:41:08,527
Speaker 1: Cause I'm not gaming with you.

529
00:41:08,648 --> 00:41:09,832
Speaker 1: Cause you don't want to play Overwatch.

530
00:41:10,654 --> 00:41:11,176
Speaker 0: No, I don't.

531
00:41:11,557 --> 00:41:12,600
Speaker 1: That's what I'm mostly playing.

532
00:41:13,523 --> 00:41:23,310
Speaker 0: So one way to make things a little bit easier for people who have time, but don't have time at the same time is asynchronous gaming.

533
00:41:23,411 --> 00:41:26,506
Speaker 0: We've talked about it a lot, but we've never dedicated a whole show to it.

534
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:29,856
Speaker 0: So the thing is, it's sort of a misnomer in a way.

535
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:38,785
Speaker 0: And that, uh, in computer terms, you know, and I guess also just, you know, uh, semantic terms, synchronous and asynchronous.

536
00:41:38,826 --> 00:41:41,837
Speaker 0: synchronous just means one thing happens after the other.

537
00:41:41,998 --> 00:41:42,218
Speaker 0: Right.

538
00:41:42,299 --> 00:41:45,530
Speaker 0: And the one step B has to wait for step a to finish.

539
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:45,891
Speaker 0: Right.

540
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:48,221
Speaker 0: So I take root is a synchronous game.

541
00:41:48,281 --> 00:41:48,884
Speaker 0: I take my turn.

542
00:41:49,225 --> 00:41:50,008
Speaker 0: Then you take your turn.

543
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:51,534
Speaker 0: Then next person takes their turn.

544
00:41:51,775 --> 00:41:51,976
Speaker 0: Right.

545
00:41:52,819 --> 00:41:56,532
Speaker 0: Uh, but race for the galaxy, even if you're sitting at a table, just playing.

546
00:41:56,573 --> 00:42:01,271
Speaker 0: it is, I don't know if it's officially an asynchronous game, but it's an asynchronous game.

547
00:42:01,291 --> 00:42:02,938
Speaker 0: You all take your turns just together.

548
00:42:02,958 --> 00:42:03,480
Speaker 0: Right.

549
00:42:03,500 --> 00:42:08,118
Speaker 0: You're not waiting necessarily for the previous person to finish before you go.

550
00:42:08,138 --> 00:42:08,901
Speaker 0: Right.

551
00:42:09,664 --> 00:42:11,993
Speaker 0: Or, you know, you can do things during other people's turns.

552
00:42:12,033 --> 00:42:13,378
Speaker 0: It's asynchronous, right?

553
00:42:13,439 --> 00:42:17,815
Speaker 1: Now it's, this isn't just a scale of a game is either asynchronous or it's not.

554
00:42:18,096 --> 00:42:21,527
Speaker 1: This is more about how asynchronous is a game.

555
00:42:21,587 --> 00:42:27,352
Speaker 1: Cause this is actually a more complex topic than you might think if you actually look at specific games and specific mechanics.

556
00:42:27,993 --> 00:42:32,146
Speaker 0: But when it comes to the internet and digital multiplayer gaming, right.

557
00:42:32,788 --> 00:42:50,114
Speaker 0: Uh, people will use the term asynchronous, even if games are technically synchronous games where like, you know, you have to take your turn and the next person and before the next person could take their turn, there's no simultaneous or, you know, actual asynchronous play, but you don't all have to play at the same time.

558
00:42:50,194 --> 00:42:53,323
Speaker 0: You can take your turn whenever you have time.

559
00:42:53,343 --> 00:42:56,817
Speaker 0: And then the next person it's, it could be hours later.

560
00:42:56,877 --> 00:42:57,843
Speaker 0: It could be immediately.

561
00:42:57,863 --> 00:42:58,928
Speaker 0: It could be the next day.

562
00:42:58,949 --> 00:42:59,792
Speaker 0: It could be the next week.

563
00:42:59,812 --> 00:43:00,616
Speaker 0: It could be the next year.

564
00:43:00,636 --> 00:43:03,989
Speaker 0: They log in and download or whatever they have to do.

565
00:43:04,811 --> 00:43:11,737
Speaker 0: And then they take their turn and then time goes by and then you basically just take your turn whenever you have time to take your turn.

566
00:43:11,777 --> 00:43:11,958
Speaker 0: Yup.

567
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:15,552
Speaker 0: So you're, it could be still, it could be synchronous.

568
00:43:15,632 --> 00:43:25,365
Speaker 0: It could be asynchronous in terms of the true meanings of those words, but in terms of, you know, the meanings you use when applied to multiplayer internet gaming.

569
00:43:25,826 --> 00:43:36,320
Speaker 0: synchronous means everyone is sitting there playing the game at the same time, like counter-strike versus you log in and take your turn whenever you have time to do it like sieve.

570
00:43:36,722 --> 00:43:37,043
Speaker 1: Yup.

571
00:43:37,103 --> 00:43:46,251
Speaker 1: Now this is where what it really comes down to is how well, how well do the mechanics of the game support practical asynchronous play?

572
00:43:46,311 --> 00:43:51,104
Speaker 1: Because I could make Overwatch asynchronous frame by frame.

573
00:43:51,445 --> 00:43:58,088
Speaker 1: Everyone has to do their next frame and once everyone's done their next frame, the game clock progresses to the following frame.

574
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:00,012
Speaker 0: Any game.

575
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:01,866
Speaker 0: It's like, what are you going to do on this frame?

576
00:44:01,926 --> 00:44:04,178
Speaker 0: I'm going to press up and click my mouse button.

577
00:44:04,318 --> 00:44:06,186
Speaker 0: What are you going to do on this frame?

578
00:44:06,246 --> 00:44:08,738
Speaker 0: I'm going to press the jump button and the special attack.

579
00:44:08,798 --> 00:44:11,992
Speaker 1: I will continue holding middle click, but now I'm also going to hit space bar.

580
00:44:12,855 --> 00:44:13,056
Speaker 0: Yup.

581
00:44:13,176 --> 00:44:15,585
Speaker 0: I'm going to continue holding the forward button.

582
00:44:15,645 --> 00:44:16,248
Speaker 0: Actually that.

583
00:44:16,308 --> 00:44:17,472
Speaker 0: Continue holding the forward button.

584
00:44:17,492 --> 00:44:19,360
Speaker 1: I kind of want to see a fighting game like that.

585
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:22,414
Speaker 1: Like Street Fighter frame by frame.

586
00:44:22,554 --> 00:44:23,740
Speaker 1: Everyone, you're just like that.

587
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,210
Speaker 0: Well, I mean the fantasy, whatever, what is that called?

588
00:44:26,571 --> 00:44:27,292
Speaker 0: Oh, fantasy strike.

589
00:44:28,074 --> 00:44:28,274
Speaker 0: Yeah.

590
00:44:28,334 --> 00:44:29,256
Speaker 0: It's kind of like that.

591
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:30,799
Speaker 0: It's slower, but not, you know.

592
00:44:30,839 --> 00:44:38,395
Speaker 0: But things like that in that nature.

593
00:44:38,896 --> 00:44:40,763
Speaker 1: But that's obviously reductive.

594
00:44:40,843 --> 00:44:45,621
Speaker 1: So like on the other side of this, there are games that support it incredibly well.

595
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:53,606
Speaker 1: Meaning the game will progress quickly and meaningfully despite larger numbers of players all taking their turns.

596
00:44:53,867 --> 00:45:05,482
Speaker 1: What it comes down to is how much does the next atom of the game or the next unit of interaction in the game in this case rely on inputs and particularly interruptions.

597
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:11,339
Speaker 1: So imagine a game where, like Civ, I take my whole turn then Scott takes his whole turn.

598
00:45:11,861 --> 00:45:17,219
Speaker 1: It actually supports asynchronous play pretty well in that I can complete my turn no matter what.

599
00:45:17,360 --> 00:45:19,750
Speaker 1: No other player ever has to do anything during my turn.

600
00:45:20,230 --> 00:45:32,494
Speaker 1: So we can support a long-term asynchronous game of Civ because it just goes turn by turn in a attacked another unit.

601
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,055
Speaker 1: Whoever I attacked, that player had the option to do something, like to defend or like take some action.

602
00:45:39,537 --> 00:45:50,536
Speaker 1: Now, if I do that on my turn, my turn stops and now the game has to go around and deal with what all the other players could do even if they choose not to do it before it can get back to me.

603
00:45:51,037 --> 00:45:55,091
Speaker 1: And that can cause a problem that will grind a game to a literal halt.

604
00:45:56,073 --> 00:46:06,925
Speaker 0: What's interesting is how game patterns that are actually bad for in-person play, right, so something like root where it's completely synchronous.

605
00:46:06,945 --> 00:46:18,265
Speaker 0: You take your whole turn and the only thing that could matter for someone else on your turn is like, I guess, the field hospital, an ambush car, or a battle where you just roll a die.

606
00:46:18,285 --> 00:46:19,610
Speaker 0: You don't really need someone to be there.

607
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:23,369
Speaker 0: Maybe they allocate damage or something, maybe, you know, something like that, right?

608
00:46:23,409 --> 00:46:28,190
Speaker 0: But there's very little to do on other players turns and players have a lot to do on their own turn.

609
00:46:28,631 --> 00:46:32,627
Speaker 0: So if you play root in person, yeah, people play quickly enough and it's good.

610
00:46:32,647 --> 00:46:37,042
Speaker 0: It moves quickly enough, but you can end up waiting for your turn.

611
00:46:37,102 --> 00:46:41,280
Speaker 0: Like just, okay, go take a snack break and then come back, take your turn, leave and come back, right?

612
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:55,279
Speaker 1: And part of that is because every time there's a fight at any point, the game has to stop and give anyone involved in a fight the opportunity to play one of those cards if they have them because that card can interrupt an existing action, right?

613
00:46:55,299 --> 00:46:57,750
Speaker 0: But what I'm saying is that in person, you have a lot of waiting.

614
00:46:58,111 --> 00:46:58,612
Speaker 0: that happens.

615
00:46:58,873 --> 00:47:04,652
Speaker 0: Whereas online, there isn't a lot of waiting because you don't actually sit there and wait.

616
00:47:04,692 --> 00:47:09,352
Speaker 0: You take your turn and then you know that it's not going to be your turn again for hours.

617
00:47:09,392 --> 00:47:11,862
Speaker 0: You don't sit there waiting and wasting your life.

618
00:47:11,902 --> 00:47:13,348
Speaker 0: You go and do something else.

619
00:47:13,769 --> 00:47:17,342
Speaker 0: Maybe take a turn in a different game, maybe, you know, right?

620
00:47:17,442 --> 00:47:20,613
Speaker 0: And then whenever you have free time, you take your turn.

621
00:47:20,694 --> 00:47:31,370
Speaker 0: So it's like you actually, if you look at the sum total of time that, you know, you that the each player spent playing the game in total, it'll be a pretty similar.

622
00:47:32,791 --> 00:47:40,641
Speaker 0: But if you look at how much time each individual person dedicated to the game, it'll be way less because they subtracted all that waiting time, right?

623
00:47:40,681 --> 00:47:42,408
Speaker 0: I didn't waste less of your life.

624
00:47:42,789 --> 00:47:47,179
Speaker 0: if the game is, is, uh, supports this kind of play well.

625
00:47:47,279 --> 00:47:47,660
Speaker 0: Right.

626
00:47:48,081 --> 00:47:53,897
Speaker 0: Um, but you know, a game, uh, that has lots of quick turns, right?

627
00:47:53,917 --> 00:47:59,380
Speaker 0: So a game that's really good in person, I always use tickets to ride is to be another one, right?

628
00:47:59,420 --> 00:48:00,283
Speaker 0: And take it to ride.

629
00:48:00,364 --> 00:48:04,441
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, you go around taking turns and take it to ride, but you do almost nothing on your turn.

630
00:48:04,482 --> 00:48:08,457
Speaker 0: You literally just like, you know, either take a couple cards or put trains at.

631
00:48:08,497 --> 00:48:09,600
Speaker 0: your turn is so small.

632
00:48:10,302 --> 00:48:17,610
Speaker 0: So it's like you're, you're taking this tiny, tiny turn and then you, what, wait hours for the person to take their tiny turn.

633
00:48:17,750 --> 00:48:19,197
Speaker 0: And then you take your tiny turn again.

634
00:48:19,277 --> 00:48:21,467
Speaker 0: It's like, that's a really bad experience.

635
00:48:21,487 --> 00:48:23,133
Speaker 0: You'll forget what the hell was going on.

636
00:48:23,454 --> 00:48:25,601
Speaker 0: Your w your right.

637
00:48:25,621 --> 00:48:27,206
Speaker 0: Your turns are so short.

638
00:48:27,247 --> 00:48:29,253
Speaker 0: You're better off just playing that live.

639
00:48:29,393 --> 00:48:30,877
Speaker 0: Everyone connected at the same time.

640
00:48:31,419 --> 00:48:33,625
Speaker 0: It'll zoom by a lot faster.

641
00:48:34,247 --> 00:48:37,056
Speaker 0: Um, but there's no reason to stretch that game out.

642
00:48:37,237 --> 00:48:58,012
Speaker 1: This is, I think where like the metric here and we're kind of spitball on this because we're thinking about this topic as we go, but that whole root situation, root, you can do a lot on your turn, but root games are significantly slowed down by the fact that there are a handful of potential interrupt actions, which means you can get less done during your turn.

643
00:48:58,494 --> 00:49:02,912
Speaker 1: I think the metric for how well a game supports asynchronous play is actually pretty simple in the end.

644
00:49:03,252 --> 00:49:14,822
Speaker 1: It is how much can one player progress the game state without any other player interactions before they must seed control to another player.

645
00:49:15,484 --> 00:49:28,127
Speaker 1: The longer that is, the more like stuff you can get done before you are forced to seed control, the better a game supports asynchronous play and the less, the less frequent control is seeded, right?

646
00:49:28,167 --> 00:49:30,774
Speaker 0: If it's constantly going back and forth a whole bunch.

647
00:49:31,657 --> 00:49:37,333
Speaker 0: Um, the other thing is that the longer the total game length, right?

648
00:49:37,413 --> 00:49:53,050
Speaker 0: The more advantageous it is to play asynchronously, because if you are playing in person, even live, even if you get everyone together, even if it's fast, if it's a five hour game, let's say playing in person live, um, you know, maybe after

649
00:49:54,374 --> 00:49:56,781
Speaker 1: like a Civ game, a live Civ game, that's five hours.

650
00:49:57,222 --> 00:50:00,695
Speaker 1: I have done one fifth of that interaction on average, right?

651
00:50:00,735 --> 00:50:06,989
Speaker 0: It's like what it's like, what are the chances you're going to get all the, even if you get everyone together, can you get everyone together to the end?

652
00:50:07,371 --> 00:50:08,556
Speaker 0: Are you going to finish it?

653
00:50:08,997 --> 00:50:16,726
Speaker 0: It's like really unlikely that you're going to get even dedicated people who prioritize gaming together for that long period of time.

654
00:50:16,786 --> 00:50:17,830
Speaker 0: It's such a long game.

655
00:50:18,331 --> 00:50:23,742
Speaker 1: I'm 39, two AM runs around like I'm stopping, right?

656
00:50:23,863 --> 00:50:29,056
Speaker 0: So the asynchronous game is a way that a game can finish, right?

657
00:50:29,076 --> 00:50:40,318
Speaker 0: You can keep it going and it will, as long as everyone's dedicated and diligent about paying attention and taking their turns when they come up, you can actually finish the game and get the full experience.

658
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:49,552
Speaker 0: You don't have to just keep replaying the beginning over and over again or save and come back to it and forget what the heck was going on, you know, anything like that.

659
00:50:49,693 --> 00:50:58,180
Speaker 0: You can so long, long games, uh, suit themselves much better than a game that's over in five minutes, like playing it asynchronously.

660
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:01,194
Speaker 0: It's like, why we can just get together for five minutes, I think, right?

661
00:51:01,535 --> 00:51:05,210
Speaker 0: There's no reason to play deep sea adventure asynchronously.

662
00:51:07,671 --> 00:51:08,293
Speaker 0: It's really silly.

663
00:51:08,434 --> 00:51:08,654
Speaker 0: Yep.

664
00:51:08,735 --> 00:51:20,393
Speaker 1: And that's where, well, the thing that is not obvious is that to design a game that is asynchronous friendly actually like really limits the kinds of mechanics you can include in the game.

665
00:51:20,955 --> 00:51:29,970
Speaker 1: Any reactive thing is basically off the table, like ambush cards in route really hampered the ability to make that game play by mail in an effective manner.

666
00:51:31,010 --> 00:51:31,090
Speaker 0: Yeah.

667
00:51:31,131 --> 00:51:36,216
Speaker 0: Imagine the gathering, you know, is like the, the ultimate interrupting game has cards called interrupt, right?

668
00:51:36,437 --> 00:51:40,734
Speaker 1: You got to form the stack of how many interrupts got played and then like play through the stack.

669
00:51:41,297 --> 00:51:42,802
Speaker 0: You know, people play it online.

670
00:51:42,842 --> 00:51:48,062
Speaker 0: They have a system for that, but it's like, you know, uh, it can even playing it live.

671
00:51:48,122 --> 00:51:49,025
Speaker 0: There's still some issues.

672
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,632
Speaker 0: Netrunner had all kinds of issues.

673
00:51:50,672 --> 00:52:01,038
Speaker 0: Cause it's like, when you play net runner, you go on a run and it's like, there's decisions like points constantly, like every step of the way, the other player has to constantly click, like, okay, not doing anything.

674
00:52:01,118 --> 00:52:01,340
Speaker 0: Okay.

675
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:01,903
Speaker 0: Not doing anything.

676
00:52:01,963 --> 00:52:02,205
Speaker 0: Okay.

677
00:52:02,225 --> 00:52:02,688
Speaker 0: Not doing anything.

678
00:52:02,728 --> 00:52:02,929
Speaker 0: Okay.

679
00:52:02,950 --> 00:52:06,084
Speaker 0: Not doing anything, doing something, you know, you don't want to miss your chance.

680
00:52:06,586 --> 00:52:34,490
Speaker 1: And this is where a lot of board games that go digital, like root made some mistakes when dire wealth, they're a great company, by the way, they've done such a fantastic job with root, but when they brought root online in order to make the game like move faster and support asynchronous play, which they built into the game, they did a few things like if I attack Scott and Scott doesn't have any ambush cards that are applicable, it won't wait for him to say, no, it'll just do the attack.

681
00:52:35,211 --> 00:52:44,557
Speaker 1: Meaning if I attack Scott and the game pauses for a while or waits for Scott to consider options, I know for a fact, he has an ambush card.

682
00:52:45,219 --> 00:52:56,439
Speaker 1: The only fair way to do that without changing the rules of root for the online version and literally making it a different game would be to have the prompt of Scott is considering his options up here.

683
00:52:57,101 --> 00:53:02,134
Speaker 1: Every single time I attack Scott, no matter what, always make Scott click.

684
00:53:02,917 --> 00:53:05,423
Speaker 0: Which hugely slows down the game.

685
00:53:05,764 --> 00:53:06,145
Speaker 0: Right.

686
00:53:06,707 --> 00:53:09,795
Speaker 1: And they made even worse mistake with the field hospital for similar reasons.

687
00:53:10,356 --> 00:53:11,178
Speaker 0: They fixed the hate field.

688
00:53:11,198 --> 00:53:11,920
Speaker 1: They did fix that.

689
00:53:12,321 --> 00:53:19,723
Speaker 1: They have used that information on purpose to my advantage in the past.

690
00:53:19,924 --> 00:53:20,626
Speaker 0: I have as well.

691
00:53:20,827 --> 00:53:23,356
Speaker 0: I'll attack a place with an ambush card.

692
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:23,838
Speaker 1: Yep.

693
00:53:23,918 --> 00:53:28,115
Speaker 1: I'll send like, I'll do like one attack in a bunny clearing and it's, it doesn't do the prompt.

694
00:53:28,477 --> 00:53:31,472
Speaker 1: Now I know it can attack the much more important bunny clearing and they got nothing.

695
00:53:32,494 --> 00:53:32,675
Speaker 0: Yep.

696
00:53:33,738 --> 00:53:49,790
Speaker 1: So, uh, another thing, like an advantage of asynchronous play that I'm finding, especially with like during COVID is you can have a lot of games going at the same time so that even if one of them slows down, like you always got something to do.

697
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:54,369
Speaker 1: I got two different train games and four different sieve games all going at the same time.

698
00:53:55,311 --> 00:53:55,513
Speaker 0: Yeah.

699
00:53:55,593 --> 00:53:57,162
Speaker 0: It's like you got nothing to, you know, it's taking.

700
00:53:57,182 --> 00:53:59,594
Speaker 0: your turn takes like a minute, a few minutes.

701
00:53:59,674 --> 00:53:59,875
Speaker 0: Right.

702
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:03,131
Speaker 0: So you can queue up a bunch of games as long as you can keep them on your head.

703
00:54:03,613 --> 00:54:08,855
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, you filled up your, all that free time during the day where you weren't doing anything meaningful.

704
00:54:09,276 --> 00:54:13,754
Speaker 0: You can now take turns in games to fill up your calendar there, you know, your schedule.

705
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:17,213
Speaker 0: It's like, yeah, you know, you take a break, eat a snack, take a turn.

706
00:54:17,233 --> 00:54:19,320
Speaker 0: You know, what were you going to do otherwise?

707
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:19,622
Speaker 0: Nothing.

708
00:54:19,642 --> 00:54:21,810
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, why not?

709
00:54:22,150 --> 00:54:27,409
Speaker 0: It's my, it's, you know, Phil, it's a much more exciting and better way to spend your time.

710
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:29,498
Speaker 0: If you're going to be stuck at home, right.

711
00:54:29,558 --> 00:54:34,355
Speaker 0: Taking turns and playing games, uh, you know, which is what you would do anyway if you had free time.

712
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:36,382
Speaker 0: Uh, why not?

713
00:54:36,502 --> 00:54:37,525
Speaker 0: It's, it's solely awesome.

714
00:54:38,248 --> 00:54:38,509
Speaker 1: Yeah.

715
00:54:38,830 --> 00:54:50,306
Speaker 0: Uh, I think, you know, one thing is that, uh, while we do have some async games to play, there are not nearly enough of them in the world and a lot of them are not done well.

716
00:54:50,466 --> 00:54:57,207
Speaker 0: Even sieve, it's like kind of broken and you need all these weird solutions did not support.

717
00:54:57,448 --> 00:54:59,356
Speaker 1: Like there was that pit boss thing with the server.

718
00:54:59,637 --> 00:55:00,883
Speaker 1: That thing barely worked.

719
00:55:00,963 --> 00:55:02,972
Speaker 1: I've gotten that thing half working so many times.

720
00:55:03,032 --> 00:55:03,394
Speaker 1: It sucked.

721
00:55:04,037 --> 00:55:18,387
Speaker 1: Uh, and some independent third party made something called giant multiplayer robot that handles it for you and just works and actually still have to save five games that are just still going, but are like wrapping toward their conclusions over these many years.

722
00:55:18,407 --> 00:55:19,110
Speaker 1: Yeah.

723
00:55:19,512 --> 00:55:24,152
Speaker 0: There's another one called player damn turn that works for sieve six and sieve five and some other games.

724
00:55:24,594 --> 00:55:27,204
Speaker 0: Um, but there's still, there's still hacks, right?

725
00:55:27,244 --> 00:55:29,632
Speaker 0: They work, but they're still kind of, they're not perfect.

726
00:55:29,853 --> 00:55:36,674
Speaker 1: But what bothers me the most is that civilization six in particular is so well suited to asynchronous play.

727
00:55:37,055 --> 00:55:43,913
Speaker 1: And yet the publisher and the developer refuse to support it in any meaningful way.

728
00:55:44,215 --> 00:55:46,445
Speaker 1: They, the things they've implemented don't actually work.

729
00:55:46,545 --> 00:55:48,273
Speaker 1: They failed like regularly.

730
00:55:48,614 --> 00:55:52,230
Speaker 1: I've lost so many games to their play by cloud option that I just gave up on it forever.

731
00:55:53,551 --> 00:55:56,802
Speaker 1: And like there's such basic stuff like a civilization six game.

732
00:55:57,123 --> 00:55:59,511
Speaker 1: Here's a like ideal use case.

733
00:55:59,571 --> 00:56:14,265
Speaker 1: If I was like the game, uh, producer or product manager or designer, like trying to solve this problem, start a game, live, get it to a certain point and then convert it to us asynchronous game from that point onward, like blitz through the beginning, play async.

734
00:56:14,546 --> 00:56:18,381
Speaker 1: And then if you feel it like, and you all get together, turn it back into a live game.

735
00:56:19,043 --> 00:56:21,131
Speaker 1: They don't make that easy to do at all.

736
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,921
Speaker 1: Like there is no button that would just make that happen.

737
00:56:24,382 --> 00:56:25,265
Speaker 0: You don't make money with that.

738
00:56:26,750 --> 00:56:28,962
Speaker 0: They make money if they sell you another DLC.

739
00:56:29,022 --> 00:56:29,203
Speaker 0: Right?

740
00:56:29,223 --> 00:56:30,912
Speaker 0: So that's what they spend all their time working on.

741
00:56:31,052 --> 00:56:33,804
Speaker 1: But yet they may play by cloud for some reason.

742
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:36,012
Speaker 1: I don't know why they even made that at all.

743
00:56:36,915 --> 00:56:37,096
Speaker 0: Yeah.

744
00:56:37,136 --> 00:56:37,778
Speaker 0: I don't know either.

745
00:56:37,798 --> 00:56:39,765
Speaker 1: Uh, especially cause it doesn't work.

746
00:56:40,467 --> 00:56:44,039
Speaker 0: You know, sieve is not really a balanced competitive game.

747
00:56:44,781 --> 00:56:47,089
Speaker 0: Uh, so it's like the multiplayer aspect of it.

748
00:56:47,209 --> 00:56:53,346
Speaker 0: You know, it's like people try to make it one, but it's not problems.

749
00:56:53,426 --> 00:56:58,566
Speaker 1: I enjoy sieve multiplayer more like an idea game in that I'm just interested in seeing like what happens.

750
00:56:58,627 --> 00:56:59,912
Speaker 1: Like let's just play it.

751
00:56:59,993 --> 00:57:05,997
Speaker 1: It's fun, but I'm not trying to win super hard because winning is kind of random if you're playing like optimally.

752
00:57:06,518 --> 00:57:09,970
Speaker 1: So it's more like, I just, it's like a fun experience.

753
00:57:10,291 --> 00:57:13,004
Speaker 1: Like I actually don't like playing six single player anymore.

754
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:14,671
Speaker 1: I only like playing it with people.

755
00:57:16,096 --> 00:57:16,538
Speaker 0: That's fine.

756
00:57:16,939 --> 00:57:26,623
Speaker 0: Uh, but yeah, asynchronous games, you know, it's like we bring up, you know, when they're good, they're not always good when they're good when, you know, sometimes different situations, but I definitely think there are enough of them.

757
00:57:26,663 --> 00:57:32,201
Speaker 0: There are so many opportunities in this space that are just sort of forgotten.

758
00:57:32,221 --> 00:57:44,844
Speaker 0: There's anyone who's made a big long board game, even if it's a crummy board game that we don't like, it's like, you know how many people would like to play asynchronous risk just on the, with a phone app, right?

759
00:57:45,526 --> 00:57:59,609
Speaker 0: Um, you know, how many people would play asynchronous twilight imperium phone app or something, you know, it's like, there's all the, all those things that people, uh, you know, nerds want, do want to play long games.

760
00:57:59,709 --> 00:58:05,993
Speaker 0: And some of them, you know, they don't prioritize it or for whatever reason, don't have friends or who knows, we can't get it together.

761
00:58:06,634 --> 00:58:15,242
Speaker 0: But if you have async with lobbies to join and play and you held people accountable to taking their turn somehow, right.

762
00:58:15,342 --> 00:58:21,104
Speaker 0: Or handle situations where people stop taking their turn, um, you know, or abandon a game and things like that.

763
00:58:21,124 --> 00:58:24,496
Speaker 0: There's, there's definitely something there to be tapped.

764
00:58:24,556 --> 00:58:26,242
Speaker 0: There is an untapped market.

765
00:58:26,403 --> 00:58:32,402
Speaker 1: I look in play your damn turn for six and I look in, uh, 18 X X games, 18 X X dot games.

766
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:36,997
Speaker 1: There are a shit ton of people playing these async games with strangers right now.

767
00:58:37,017 --> 00:58:38,985
Speaker 0: Well, I think it helps.

768
00:58:39,005 --> 00:58:53,319
Speaker 0: people are at home, but even before that, this, there's a lot of, uh, you know, people who want this kind of thing, you know, it's just something to do throughout the day instead of, you know, instead of checking your Twitter instead of doom scrolling or Facebooking, right.

769
00:58:53,439 --> 00:58:56,431
Speaker 0: It's like, you can check this site for turns to take in a game.

770
00:58:56,471 --> 00:58:58,918
Speaker 0: I think that's much better for you as a person.

771
00:58:58,938 --> 00:59:01,085
Speaker 0: Uh, I would say, right.

772
00:59:02,148 --> 00:59:04,558
Speaker 0: Uh, you know, and it's like, you could make money.

773
00:59:04,719 --> 00:59:06,346
Speaker 0: These things are like kind of free ish.

774
00:59:06,467 --> 00:59:07,170
Speaker 0: Some of them, right.

775
00:59:07,591 --> 00:59:10,260
Speaker 0: It's like, and make this stuff.

776
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:10,922
Speaker 0: People want it.

777
00:59:11,223 --> 00:59:13,230
Speaker 1: I think a big problem is a lot of game designers.

778
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:16,881
Speaker 1: They don't think about the asynchronous use case at all.

779
00:59:17,122 --> 00:59:21,397
Speaker 1: So, so many board games have one or two mechanics that make async basically impossible.

780
00:59:22,883 --> 00:59:25,774
Speaker 1: Like so many games that feel like they'd be such an asynchronous game.

781
00:59:26,096 --> 00:59:31,440
Speaker 1: If you actually try to build that, you're going to find there's one fucking mechanic that makes it not work at all.

782
00:59:31,822 --> 00:59:32,645
Speaker 1: And then you have a choice.

783
00:59:33,188 --> 00:59:36,480
Speaker 1: If you make it asynchronous by changing that mechanic, you've made a completely different game.

784
00:59:38,868 --> 00:59:55,050
Speaker 1: So what I, the real advice I would have, if you're designing a board game that is moderately complicated, see if you can avoid the kinds of mechanics, mostly interrupts or short turns, or it like actions that require all the players to do something before the game can proceed.

785
00:59:55,472 --> 01:00:04,130
Speaker 1: Try to make the unit of interaction of the player, like the individual player's atoms, be as big as possible before another player is obligated to take an action.

786
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,571
