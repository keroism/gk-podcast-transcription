1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,689
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, May 9th, 2012.

2
00:00:10,689 --> 00:00:10,911
Speaker 1: I'm Rim.

3
00:00:12,845 --> 00:00:13,218
Speaker 0: I'm Sky.

4
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,145
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,205 --> 00:00:20,420
Speaker 1: Tonight, the anime that everyone forgot about somehow, despite being surprisingly popular in the US.

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,218
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,298
Speaker 0: So it's getting close to the end of the work day, and my phone goes ring-a-ling, and I'm like,

8
00:00:31,338 --> 00:00:31,619
Speaker 0: "What?".

9
00:00:32,082 --> 00:00:34,360
Speaker 1: I predict another fascinating anecdote.

10
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,347
Speaker 0: And I'm like, "Who the hell is calling me?

11
00:00:36,407 --> 00:00:37,250
Speaker 0: No one calls me.

12
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:39,498
Speaker 0: You're not supposed to call on the telephone in the modern

13
00:00:39,538 --> 00:00:39,980
Speaker 0: times.".

14
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:40,722
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

15
00:00:40,762 --> 00:00:48,140
Speaker 1: Whenever I get a phone call, and it's not during an event where I'm rapidly in real-time coordinating with people, it's always kind of weird.

16
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:55,138
Speaker 1: It's like, "Alright, you're calling me, so it must be urgent, but I'm not talking to you online, so it's probably like someone got

17
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,060
Speaker 1: hospitalized.".

18
00:00:56,961 --> 00:01:00,612
Speaker 0: So, first of all, it wasn't one of those blocked numbers.

19
00:01:00,712 --> 00:01:03,320
Speaker 0: It showed the number, and it showed where the area code was.

20
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,220
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

21
00:01:04,521 --> 00:01:06,526
Speaker 0: And I was like, "Huh, alright,".

22
00:01:06,586 --> 00:01:11,580
Speaker 0: but obviously they weren't in my contacts, and I think they were from far away, like Texas or Arizona or something.

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:11,929
Speaker 0: I was like,

24
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:12,156
Speaker 0: "What?".

25
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:20,278
Speaker 0: So anyway, I'm like, "Alright, speak," and I pick it up, and immediately it says, "We are from political

26
00:01:20,398 --> 00:01:21,120
Speaker 0: something-something.".

27
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,633
Speaker 0: I think it's gonna be one of those political survey situations, right?

28
00:01:23,653 --> 00:01:24,357
Speaker 0: Like, "Who you gonna vote

29
00:01:24,397 --> 00:01:24,638
Speaker 0: for?".

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,943
Speaker 1: You know, I used to.

31
00:01:26,023 --> 00:01:37,820
Speaker 1: There was a time in my life, up until about four years ago, when I would, whenever anyone like that called me, I would mess with them, I'd talk to them, I'd do something, but I don't have time for that anymore.

32
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:48,200
Speaker 1: If anyone calls me, and it is not immediately apparent that they are a human who has something real to tell me that I probably already know, I just hang up without saying a word, and if they call back, I block the number in Google.

33
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,979
Speaker 0: So I just listen for a little bit, 'cause what else am I gonna do, right?

34
00:01:51,921 --> 00:02:02,699
Speaker 0: And they're like, they pretty much said, "If you do this, we will give you a free two-day cruise to the Bahamas on behalf of the people who are paying for

35
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:02,919
Speaker 0: this.".

36
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:09,039
Speaker 1: Oh, so it's one of those fake cruises where it's technically a real cruise, but they probably like force you to do stuff and sell you stuff.

37
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,675
Speaker 0: I have no idea what it is.

38
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,300
Speaker 1: And if you don't follow the rules, then they make you pay.

39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:14,334
Speaker 0: I have no idea what it is, but I'm like,

40
00:02:14,394 --> 00:02:14,998
Speaker 0: "Whoa!".

41
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:17,700
Speaker 0: So I put it on speakerphone so everyone can hear this hilariousness.

42
00:02:18,342 --> 00:02:23,939
Speaker 0: It plays the message again, and it's like, "Press 2 to do the thing, and press 9, and we'll never call you

43
00:02:23,979 --> 00:02:24,180
Speaker 0: again.".

44
00:02:24,320 --> 00:02:28,160
Speaker 0: So while it's repeating this message over and over, I search for the name of this place.

45
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,178
Speaker 0: You should've recorded it.

46
00:02:29,882 --> 00:02:30,418
Speaker 0: How do you do that?

47
00:02:30,902 --> 00:02:31,531
Speaker 1: Google Voice.

48
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:32,220
Speaker 1: You just hit--.

49
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,080
Speaker 0: I don't have Google Voice.

50
00:02:34,125 --> 00:02:34,166
Speaker 1: Oh.

51
00:02:34,186 --> 00:02:36,460
Speaker 1: I record every phone conversation I have.

52
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:37,000
Speaker 0: That's cool.

53
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:47,260
Speaker 0: So I go to search for the name of the political whatever it is, and I'm at Google, and I add the word "scam," and they're like, "Yeah, dudes, it's a scam.

54
00:02:47,341 --> 00:02:49,519
Speaker 0: They're just trying to get you to pay a hundred and something bucks.

55
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:51,308
Speaker 0: That's all it is, is?

56
00:02:51,328 --> 00:02:52,054
Speaker 0: they're just trying to get your

57
00:02:52,095 --> 00:02:52,317
Speaker 0: money.".

58
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,720
Speaker 0: And it's like two-day cruise, seriously.

59
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,216
Speaker 0: It's like even if you figured out how to actually get the cruise, even if there's no other weird loopholes on it, two days, it's like, "Yeah, we'll take it there.

60
00:03:01,236 --> 00:03:01,797
Speaker 0: We'll take it back up.

61
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:02,599
Speaker 0: Okay,

62
00:03:02,619 --> 00:03:02,760
Speaker 0: bye.".

63
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,020
Speaker 0: And tiny cabin with a bunch of people who fell for the scam are also on the cruise.

64
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, the kind of people you probably don't want to hang out with.

65
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:13,320
Speaker 0: Especially not in a boat that you can't escape from in the middle of the water.

66
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:16,940
Speaker 1: I really just don't see the appeal of the standard cruise.

67
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:32,800
Speaker 1: You could do a cool kind of cruise in a lot of situations, but it seems like when most people say they're going on a cruise, it's like Princess or something, and it's basically a floating Marriott for a week with a bunch of the kinds of people who would go to a floating Marriott for a week.

68
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:37,480
Speaker 0: Imagine if you took the Magfest hotel, put it on a boat, and some of the food's free and some is not.

69
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,439
Speaker 1: Now, that would be awesome.

70
00:03:39,222 --> 00:03:39,960
Speaker 0: But there's no Magfest.

71
00:03:40,021 --> 00:03:41,819
Speaker 1: If Magfest were happening during it.

72
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:45,257
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, Mag cruise, get it going.

73
00:03:45,277 --> 00:03:45,840
Speaker 0: All right, anyway.

74
00:03:47,042 --> 00:03:47,989
Speaker 1: What's the phrase?

75
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:49,440
Speaker 1: People say this a lot.

76
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:52,830
Speaker 1: The only people who go on those cruises are newlywed or nearly dead.

77
00:03:52,851 --> 00:03:53,232
Speaker 1: Anyway.

78
00:03:56,501 --> 00:04:03,040
Speaker 0: Anyway, so the point is, if you get the same phone call, it's a scam, obviously.

79
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:09,316
Speaker 0: If you needed me to tell you it was a scam, I recommend you just not pick up your phone ever.

80
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,400
Speaker 0: And don't go to any web pages.

81
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:20,399
Speaker 1: If any number calls you and it's not a human telling you something that's real and somehow relates to you in a direct way, it's a scam.

82
00:04:21,601 --> 00:04:24,160
Speaker 1: Or it's a telemarketer, which is basically a scam.

83
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:25,446
Speaker 0: Everything's a scam.

84
00:04:25,526 --> 00:04:27,980
Speaker 0: This is the only way to be safe if you are too dumb to tell.

85
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:40,880
Speaker 1: So it's not really news that the New York Anime Festival is happening, other than the fact that it is somehow surviving, much like a mitochondria inside of a cell of a larger being.

86
00:04:41,801 --> 00:04:52,331
Speaker 1: But it appears to once again be relegated to the tiniest, backiest, most hidden corner of the Javits, and seems to have its own website and its own track.

87
00:04:52,411 --> 00:05:00,340
Speaker 1: I imagine it'll have that, I hate to use this word, but I'm going to use it, pathetic anime stage instead of panel content or real rooms.

88
00:05:01,502 --> 00:05:03,318
Speaker 1: I think it's going to be pretty much the same thing as last year.

89
00:05:03,921 --> 00:05:06,560
Speaker 1: So I don't really have anything to say about it except it's happening.

90
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:12,639
Speaker 1: I've stopped submitting anime content to that event because it just doesn't seem worth it.

91
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:13,760
Speaker 0: No, that's not worth it.

92
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:25,340
Speaker 1: I mean, I'd still go to Otacon, Anime Boston, Zenkai Con, Kinetic Con, but the New York Anime Festival as a vestigial organ, an appendix to the New York Comic Con, is sad.

93
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:30,680
Speaker 1: It feels like I went to the anime part and checked it out, and it felt like a small anime con.

94
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,920
Speaker 1: It felt like that Ohio con, only pretty happening.

95
00:05:33,101 --> 00:05:39,540
Speaker 0: Like an artist alley with a lot of people in it, and a big room full of tables, and a stage with stereotypical stuff happening.

96
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,730
Speaker 1: Now, here's my trouble with it.

97
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:41,316
Speaker 1: That area.

98
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:48,380
Speaker 1: So the part that I can't deal with as I get older with anime cons is any public area at the con.

99
00:05:49,041 --> 00:05:52,020
Speaker 1: And the New York Anime Festival is nothing but that public area.

100
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:56,520
Speaker 1: There's no panel room with Daryl Surratt doing something awesome or Mike Tool doing something awesome.

101
00:05:56,640 --> 00:06:01,660
Speaker 1: It's just one big room, and if you try to go to a panel, well, it's the anime stage.

102
00:06:01,941 --> 00:06:03,409
Speaker 1: You're still in that big room.

103
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:05,099
Speaker 1: You can't escape it.

104
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:05,720
Speaker 0: Nope.

105
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,838
Speaker 1: So if we're there, we actually didn't present last year either.

106
00:06:10,762 --> 00:06:13,220
Speaker 1: If we present, we're not presenting on that anime stage.

107
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:15,600
Speaker 1: We're probably not doing any anime content.

108
00:06:15,942 --> 00:06:16,132
Speaker 1: Yep.

109
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,439
Speaker 1: Either video games or comics or press.

110
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:21,780
Speaker 0: Whatever.

111
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,520
Speaker 1: I don't think we even really did a show on it after last year.

112
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:31,940
Speaker 1: I didn't have much to say other than I talked to every employee of Hasbro, and none of them had anything to say about My Little Pony.

113
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,940
Speaker 0: Maybe they'll have something to say this time.

114
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,461
Speaker 0: They better.

115
00:06:34,642 --> 00:06:44,533
Speaker 1: Last year, the only thing I got out of them was I kept asking around, and I was in a suit, and I had my press credential and all my stuff, and I was like, "Look, this is my assignment.

116
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:45,638
Speaker 1: I need to talk to someone about

117
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:45,779
Speaker 1: this.".

118
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:51,480
Speaker 1: So finally they put me in charge of the guy who was the head of whatever at the con for Hasbro.

119
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:56,257
Speaker 1: And he was like, "Look, every press person who has come up to us has asked about My Little

120
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:56,558
Speaker 1: Pony.".

121
00:06:57,502 --> 00:06:59,995
Speaker 1: We didn't anticipate anyone would be interested.

122
00:07:00,056 --> 00:07:00,920
Speaker 1: We didn't bring anything.

123
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,126
Speaker 1: I don't have anything to say.

124
00:07:02,146 --> 00:07:08,920
Speaker 1: I could do an interview with you, but I literally have nothing to tell you that you can't find out from the website.

125
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:13,240
Speaker 0: But it's like you work for this company, and you don't know anything about the things at the company you work for.

126
00:07:13,702 --> 00:07:15,998
Speaker 1: No, so the only thing I asked him, I was like, "No, he knew about

127
00:07:16,038 --> 00:07:16,079
Speaker 1: it.".

128
00:07:16,584 --> 00:07:17,719
Speaker 1: He didn't have anything to say to the press.

129
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:28,179
Speaker 1: They didn't expect anyone cared about My Little Pony, because this was still before bronies kind of became well-known to the mainstream of nerdery and internet-y.

130
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,180
Speaker 1: Like, that was on the rising tide.

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:30,343
Speaker 0: We knew.

132
00:07:30,485 --> 00:07:31,380
Speaker 0: Why do we always know?

133
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,043
Speaker 1: Of course we knew.

134
00:07:32,103 --> 00:07:33,231
Speaker 1: We were not number one, though.

135
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:34,420
Speaker 1: Don't pretend that we were number one.

136
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,493
Speaker 0: I'm not saying I'm number one.

137
00:07:35,513 --> 00:07:35,959
Speaker 0: I'm just saying...

138
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:38,035
Speaker 1: People told us to watch it, and I was like,

139
00:07:38,055 --> 00:07:38,095
Speaker 1: "Eh?"

140
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:41,108
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'm just saying, why do we...

141
00:07:41,148 --> 00:07:45,140
Speaker 0: We weren't even the first, but yet we were still so far ahead of the curve.

142
00:07:45,581 --> 00:07:46,059
Speaker 0: How is this...

143
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:51,076
Speaker 1: Oh, Scott, it's easy, because we don't have anything better to do than to stare at the internet 24/7, constantly refreshing deeds of things.

144
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,841
Speaker 0: Why are other people not staring at the internet 24/7?

145
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:58,516
Speaker 1: One, that's actually pretty boring most of the time.

146
00:07:58,576 --> 00:07:59,140
Speaker 1: I mean, I remember...

147
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,259
Speaker 0: What else are they fucking doing?

148
00:08:01,383 --> 00:08:01,846
Speaker 1: I don't know.

149
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,080
Speaker 1: Having sex, going outside...

150
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:05,659
Speaker 0: You don't need to do that shit.

151
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:08,835
Speaker 1: No, Scott, I'm leading you in a different direction.

152
00:08:08,856 --> 00:08:09,620
Speaker 1: You're not going with me.

153
00:08:10,181 --> 00:08:11,900
Speaker 1: The answer to that is Google Glass.

154
00:08:12,443 --> 00:08:12,720
Speaker 0: That's right.

155
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:23,280
Speaker 1: Anyway... But I do have some real things to talk about, because we kind of previewed the new Lupin, the Fujiko Mine show, but it's not all out yet.

156
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:26,500
Speaker 1: We're not going to review it until it's all out, even though it's great.

157
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:34,380
Speaker 0: We could really use another episode idea for a Wednesday show, and being able to talk about a good show again would be a great Wednesday episode.

158
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:43,460
Speaker 1: Well, I want to see enough, because until recently, we hadn't gotten a full-on Zenigata, and we got a lot more Zenigata now, so I have more things to say.

159
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:54,720
Speaker 1: But the other shows I've been watching, I've caught up on Venture Brothers, which half of you out there are going too little, too late, or somehow amazed that I'm so late to that party.

160
00:08:55,901 --> 00:09:04,220
Speaker 1: And I've been watching Legend of Korra, which is amazing, but I can't talk about it, because Scott hasn't even seen the original Avatar, which is one of the best cartoons ever.

161
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:05,729
Speaker 1: Yeah, it is.

162
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,720
Speaker 1: It's really good.

163
00:09:07,261 --> 00:09:09,599
Speaker 1: And the new one is way better than that one.

164
00:09:10,201 --> 00:09:24,100
Speaker 1: In fact, I would argue that the new Avatar is the third best, no, fourth best cartoon, maybe third best, that I am watching or have watched in recent memory, that is current.

165
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:28,620
Speaker 1: That is right up there with Ponies, Archer, Venture Brothers.

166
00:09:30,181 --> 00:09:34,160
Speaker 0: So, only of those, only Ponies is excellent.

167
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,449
Speaker 1: You haven't seen any of it.

168
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,940
Speaker 1: You don't even know what it's about, or what it is.

169
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,320
Speaker 0: I know I don't like Archer, and I've seen five minutes of Venture Brothers and didn't care.

170
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:44,640
Speaker 1: Yeah, and what about Avatar?

171
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,079
Speaker 0: I haven't seen any of it.

172
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:46,604
Speaker 1: Really?

173
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:48,180
Speaker 0: It's really good.

174
00:09:49,028 --> 00:09:49,440
Speaker 0: Eh, whatever.

175
00:09:49,880 --> 00:10:03,520
Speaker 1: Okay, but the other thing I've been watching, other than Space Brothers, because I'm actually watching a lot of cartoons lately, is Kids on the Slope, that jazz anime with music by Yoko Kanno and directed by the same guy who directed Cowboy Bebop.

176
00:10:05,464 --> 00:10:11,920
Speaker 1: And no one's really talking about this, at least in my anime circles, except for the people who are hardcore about anime.

177
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,398
Speaker 0: That's how it usually goes.

178
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,540
Speaker 1: Even though it's a great show so far.

179
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,133
Speaker 0: What are the typical anime punk kids talking about?

180
00:10:18,153 --> 00:10:19,520
Speaker 0: There must be a show for them, right?

181
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,086
Speaker 0: One Piece.

182
00:10:20,594 --> 00:10:20,959
Speaker 1: Soul Eater.

183
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:22,320
Speaker 0: Still?

184
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:23,479
Speaker 0: Soul Eater One Piece.

185
00:10:25,064 --> 00:10:27,620
Speaker 0: I know One Piece is always going, but it's like... Soul Eater.

186
00:10:27,962 --> 00:10:29,273
Speaker 0: Is Soul Eater Bleach Naruto?

187
00:10:29,314 --> 00:10:30,040
Speaker 0: Are those still going?

188
00:10:30,601 --> 00:10:31,323
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

189
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:35,735
Speaker 1: Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood still seems to be pretty popular among the young kids, I guess.

190
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,678
Speaker 0: Well, I don't even know.

191
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:39,580
Speaker 1: People still talk about it.

192
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,874
Speaker 0: I have every volume of the manga now.

193
00:10:40,894 --> 00:10:41,359
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read it.

194
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,662
Speaker 1: I'm waiting.

195
00:10:43,063 --> 00:10:51,200
Speaker 1: The reason I haven't watched Brotherhood yet is that it has the problem that a good chunk of it is just a slightly crooked retelling of the anime I watched the first time.

196
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:54,540
Speaker 0: Well, if it's like the manga, it is much more than slightly crooked.

197
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:57,280
Speaker 1: Well, no, there's a point where they deviate heavily.

198
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:58,920
Speaker 0: It's like volume one.

199
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,703
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the anime...

200
00:11:01,244 --> 00:11:09,560
Speaker 1: I can't just skip that part because a number of people have told me that if I skip it and just start where things diverge, it won't make sense because they've crooked a few things just enough.

201
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:12,540
Speaker 0: Well, there'll be characters that you don't even know who the fuck they are.

202
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:23,920
Speaker 1: But the original Full Metal Alchemist, which was an amazing show but kind of forgettable, but I guess we'll talk about that in the second half because it's kind of relevant, is still too fresh in the memory.

203
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:29,093
Speaker 1: So I'm trying to wait until I get to the point where I say, "Hey, I should rewatch Full Metal Alchemist.

204
00:11:29,194 --> 00:11:29,775
Speaker 1: It's been long

205
00:11:29,815 --> 00:11:30,036
Speaker 1: enough.".

206
00:11:30,076 --> 00:11:31,660
Speaker 1: And then I'll just watch Brotherhood instead.

207
00:11:32,020 --> 00:11:37,540
Speaker 0: I'm just gonna read the whole manga and that should erase... that'll take over my Full Metal Alchemist portion of my brain.

208
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:39,260
Speaker 1: Well, what worries me is that...

209
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,200
Speaker 0: Kick out the anime part.

210
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:48,000
Speaker 1: Dave Riley a while ago, this was a long time ago, said something like he started to watch Brotherhood, but then for whatever reason, I think him and Grotz started watching the original again.

211
00:11:48,822 --> 00:11:51,179
Speaker 1: And they just kind of kept watching the original and finished that.

212
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:52,260
Speaker 0: Okay.

213
00:11:53,404 --> 00:11:55,380
Speaker 1: I never even watched the movie of the original.

214
00:11:56,212 --> 00:11:56,380
Speaker 0: Nope.

215
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,378
Speaker 1: Like, I got it right away.

216
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,745
Speaker 0: I think there were a few movies.

217
00:11:58,765 --> 00:12:02,120
Speaker 0: I didn't even know what there was because all I did was watch the original TV and that's it.

218
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:14,440
Speaker 1: I just remember being really excited about that movie and then when I realized how it was set and what it was about, I... I have never gone from interested in something to not interested in it as quickly as I did the Full Metal Alchemist movie.

219
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:15,652
Speaker 0: Anyway.

220
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:19,087
Speaker 1: Anyway, Kids in the Slope is pretty good.

221
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:23,580
Speaker 1: You should watch it if you're an anime fan and we will review it once Scott has watched it as well.

222
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:24,802
Speaker 0: Someday.

223
00:12:24,822 --> 00:12:27,459
Speaker 0: I still didn't watch the previous whatever show.

224
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:28,605
Speaker 1: What do you mean?

225
00:12:28,626 --> 00:12:29,439
Speaker 1: the previous whatever show?

226
00:12:29,801 --> 00:12:32,120
Speaker 0: By Watanabe, the Michiko show.

227
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:32,960
Speaker 1: You didn't watch that either?

228
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,580
Speaker 1: I've seen enough episodes to know it's awesome, but I didn't finish it.

229
00:12:36,141 --> 00:12:38,700
Speaker 0: I really just not watching so much.

230
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,319
Speaker 0: Why not?

231
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,975
Speaker 0: Because I watched, you know, I watched...

232
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:43,499
Speaker 1: It's because you're watching Ponies and Running Man.

233
00:12:43,783 --> 00:12:45,099
Speaker 0: Well, I watch Running Man every week.

234
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:45,469
Speaker 0: I know.

235
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:51,840
Speaker 0: It's because I watched so many long animes, like all Hokuto no Ken, all Galaxy Express, all Yamato.

236
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:56,539
Speaker 0: I watched all these long shows and I barreled through every single episode of them.

237
00:12:57,581 --> 00:13:02,180
Speaker 0: And now it's sort of like, well, I got enough animes for a while.

238
00:13:03,261 --> 00:13:05,818
Speaker 0: Don't really need more animes any time soon.

239
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:10,740
Speaker 1: Alright, even though there's... I've seen all these movies because I don't need to see movies anymore.

240
00:13:11,061 --> 00:13:11,342
Speaker 0: I am.

241
00:13:11,463 --> 00:13:15,840
Speaker 0: I'm also watching a lot of movies lately, but not animes.

242
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,720
Speaker 1: So anyway, you got any news or anything?

243
00:13:19,502 --> 00:13:20,968
Speaker 0: It's a tiny news and it's funny.

244
00:13:20,988 --> 00:13:23,500
Speaker 0: you mention Yoko Kanno because she's involved in this news, right?

245
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:30,580
Speaker 0: Uniqlo is a clothing store and apparently they do stuff that really has nothing to do with clothing also.

246
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:36,020
Speaker 0: There's like five different Uniqlo iPhone apps and only like two of them have anything to do with clothing.

247
00:13:36,722 --> 00:13:39,499
Speaker 0: But they just came out with a new one called Uniqlo Wake Up.

248
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:43,200
Speaker 0: And actually what this is, is it's an alarm clock that wakes you up.

249
00:13:43,441 --> 00:13:45,099
Speaker 0: And you might think, what the fuck, why do I need that?

250
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,003
Speaker 0: Right?

251
00:13:46,246 --> 00:13:47,320
Speaker 0: It's also for Android apparently.

252
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,999
Speaker 0: Uh, why do I need that?

253
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,039
Speaker 0: The iPhone and Android both have alarm clocks.

254
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:53,118
Speaker 0: This is dumb.

255
00:13:54,121 --> 00:13:57,220
Speaker 0: Well, what this does, it's different than a regular alarm clock.

256
00:13:58,301 --> 00:14:06,378
Speaker 0: Is it wakes you up and it actually speaks and tells you, you know, like what the... What the temperature is and what the weather's gonna be.

257
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,419
Speaker 1: Old people watches can do that.

258
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,420
Speaker 0: And it also, it plays a little happy music.

259
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:18,560
Speaker 0: And the music varies depending on factors such as weather and temperature and what day it is and all that kind of stuff.

260
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:23,180
Speaker 0: So it's not like, you know, normally with my, you know, iPhone alarm clock what wakes me up?

261
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,480
Speaker 0: Eh, eh, eh, get the fuck up, eh, right?

262
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,999
Speaker 0: With this it was like, ah, waking up.

263
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:35,420
Speaker 0: And then the other thing is that it's actually, you know, when you got that iPhone alarm, right?

264
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:38,280
Speaker 0: There's a pop up that you push a button on it to turn it off immediately.

265
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:42,920
Speaker 0: With this, you actually have to open the app and go into it to turn it off.

266
00:14:43,342 --> 00:14:46,340
Speaker 0: So it's actually slightly more difficult to disable.

267
00:14:47,402 --> 00:14:51,100
Speaker 0: Uh, so it's a better waker upper that is also less grading.

268
00:14:52,381 --> 00:14:56,100
Speaker 0: And it's, Yoko Kanno did all that, you know, variable kind of music in it.

269
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,918
Speaker 0: I think she collaborated with someone on it.

270
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,439
Speaker 0: Uh, Keigo Oyamada and Yoko Kanno.

271
00:15:03,205 --> 00:15:04,019
Speaker 0: Those are the two people.

272
00:15:04,492 --> 00:15:04,780
Speaker 1: Alright.

273
00:15:05,461 --> 00:15:10,540
Speaker 0: So, you can wake up pleasantly with this app that was made for free by a clothing store.

274
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:14,560
Speaker 1: You know, we're not talking about, in the second half, obscure anime that no one remembers.

275
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:22,020
Speaker 1: But, uh, to this day, anytime someone says the words, "Wake up," I just immediately hear that song from Gokudo.

276
00:15:22,284 --> 00:15:22,680
Speaker 0: I know, right?

277
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:24,319
Speaker 1: Wake up, wake up, wake up.

278
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:24,773
Speaker 0: Yep.

279
00:15:26,862 --> 00:15:30,940
Speaker 1: And one last little bit, because the anime industry in America is, uh, amazing.

280
00:15:31,804 --> 00:15:33,260
Speaker 0: You know, I just want to point out, right?

281
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:38,399
Speaker 0: We've mentioned many times in this show, in the early episodes of Geek Nights, we're all, "Nintendo, Nintendo, Nintendo, PC's

282
00:15:38,439 --> 00:15:38,620
Speaker 0: dead."

283
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:42,300
Speaker 0: And now, the current episodes, obviously, that's no longer the case.

284
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:47,780
Speaker 0: But it's funny how, anime industry down the shitter, really, the story hasn't changed.

285
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:54,380
Speaker 1: Well, particularly in America, because, Mike Tool tweeted this, if you missed it, I'll talk about it briefly.

286
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:04,940
Speaker 1: Basically, Media Blasters, uh, appeared officially dissolved, as far as the state of New York was concerned, as of April of 2011.

287
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:08,592
Speaker 1: So, Anime News Network had a story that was like, "Yeah, check this out.

288
00:16:09,575 --> 00:16:10,097
Speaker 1: Dissolved.

289
00:16:10,638 --> 00:16:11,019
Speaker 1: Wonder what's

290
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:11,180
Speaker 1: up.".

291
00:16:11,241 --> 00:16:12,579
Speaker 1: We tried to call them, they didn't respond.

292
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:15,340
Speaker 0: I've seen them at conventions, though.

293
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:21,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, so, there was a response from a gentleman, on behalf of Media Blasters, in their forum.

294
00:16:22,562 --> 00:16:26,980
Speaker 1: And it is him losing his shit, in an unprofessional way, about this whole story.

295
00:16:27,820 --> 00:16:28,071
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

296
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:40,681
Speaker 1: It appears that what really happened had to do with them not having actually filed their taxes, and instead had filed extensions, for, like, 2009, 2010, and 2011.

297
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:45,260
Speaker 1: But, eventually, because they kept filing extensions, something happened, and now they have to get caught up on all this paperwork.

298
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:50,100
Speaker 1: And, it's basically the kind of stuff that happens to every, like, small or poorly run company.

299
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:56,040
Speaker 1: And, I know the anime industry is run primarily in the US by people who really are passionate about anime.

300
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,880
Speaker 1: May not be super business savvy.

301
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:01,440
Speaker 1: But, you gotta be at least a little bit professional.

302
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:04,211
Speaker 1: And, if you screw up like this, it's fine.

303
00:17:04,412 --> 00:17:06,079
Speaker 1: It's okay if you screw up like this.

304
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:11,800
Speaker 1: I've been late on so many stupid tax filings for the sales tax crap I had to do for that Geek Nights store.

305
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:12,742
Speaker 1: But, you know what?

306
00:17:13,143 --> 00:17:13,806
Speaker 1: I dealt with it.

307
00:17:14,107 --> 00:17:17,940
Speaker 1: I didn't freak out publicly in a forum about it, on behalf of Geek Nights.

308
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:22,095
Speaker 0: Yeah, it makes you look like, you know, it doesn't instill a lot of confidence.

309
00:17:22,194 --> 00:17:23,460
Speaker 0: It makes you look like a moron.

310
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:28,020
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it exposes the reality that you are a moron, right?

311
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:28,823
Speaker 1: Maybe not a moron.

312
00:17:28,863 --> 00:17:32,618
Speaker 1: Maybe just you're not, you don't know business that well, or you can't keep your cool, you can't...

313
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,179
Speaker 0: It comes down to... It exposes the truth.

314
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:41,039
Speaker 0: If you... But, then again, if that's the truth, then you are also incapable of concealing it.

315
00:17:41,581 --> 00:17:54,800
Speaker 1: It's specifically that if you respond to a story like this, the way that this thread went, officially, or on behalf of your small company, it just proves that you can't, even if you're not professional, you can't even act like a professional.

316
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,400
Speaker 1: And, stuff like this is why we have such a low opinion of the anime industry in the US.

317
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:08,120
Speaker 0: Well, you know, we always talk about how we're so, we don't like big companies and how corporate and shut up and boring they are, right?

318
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:08,568
Speaker 1: You say that.

319
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:09,059
Speaker 1: I don't care.

320
00:18:09,466 --> 00:18:09,779
Speaker 0: I care.

321
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:17,800
Speaker 1: I actually prefer having a faceless corporate landlord because they give me way less trouble than unprofessional local dude landlord ever did.

322
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:21,220
Speaker 0: Well, no, no, no, but I mean like, you know, you ask a company a question, right?

323
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,150
Speaker 0: And the question, and they're like, "No comment.

324
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:24,678
Speaker 0: We cannot say anything at this

325
00:18:24,718 --> 00:18:25,020
Speaker 0: time."

326
00:18:25,161 --> 00:18:26,173
Speaker 0: Instead of just like, "Listen,

327
00:18:26,213 --> 00:18:26,497
Speaker 0: dudes.".

328
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we don't want actually answering and then flipping out like some kid on a forum.

329
00:18:32,360 --> 00:18:35,300
Speaker 1: You know, we want everything to be run the way Penny Arcade is run.

330
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:37,280
Speaker 0: Right, we want everything to be right down the middle.

331
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,980
Speaker 0: You just talk to us like normal, respectable human beings.

332
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:48,580
Speaker 0: You don't be all corporate and uptight, not saying anything so that you, you know, like a robot where we can't even believe that you're a person.

333
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,440
Speaker 1: Scott, name any significant company other than the Penny Arcade Corporation.

334
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,879
Speaker 0: Even Penny Arcade keeps secrets and such.

335
00:18:55,243 --> 00:18:55,640
Speaker 1: Like what?

336
00:18:56,201 --> 00:18:58,759
Speaker 0: I mean, do you know, they're up to something right now.

337
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,550
Speaker 0: Where is there going to be third packs?

338
00:19:00,591 --> 00:19:01,700
Speaker 0: Where is it going to be, right?

339
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,520
Speaker 0: This whispers, but they don't say what they're thinking.

340
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,400
Speaker 1: Because they haven't decided yet, probably.

341
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:09,700
Speaker 0: Of course, but, you know, they could include us in the conversation.

342
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:10,141
Speaker 1: Why?

343
00:19:10,403 --> 00:19:12,440
Speaker 1: I don't care to be included in the conversation.

344
00:19:12,827 --> 00:19:13,319
Speaker 1: I wouldn't mind.

345
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,382
Speaker 1: I don't think it's a big deal.

346
00:19:14,402 --> 00:19:22,040
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't involve the listeners in, you know, my planning of a trip to Turkey and whether or not that's going to influence a week of geek nights being on or not.

347
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,520
Speaker 0: Or, you know, what we're- They're not giving us money.

348
00:19:25,561 --> 00:19:29,040
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've never actually given Penny Arcade money.

349
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:29,920
Speaker 0: Ever?

350
00:19:30,483 --> 00:19:31,599
Speaker 1: I don't think I ever have.

351
00:19:32,341 --> 00:19:32,825
Speaker 0: Not once.

352
00:19:32,926 --> 00:19:34,480
Speaker 0: You bought Penny Arcade packs t-shirts.

353
00:19:35,181 --> 00:19:36,288
Speaker 1: Okay, I bought one Penny.

354
00:19:36,348 --> 00:19:38,480
Speaker 1: I bought a PAX t-shirt at two PAXes.

355
00:19:39,505 --> 00:19:40,159
Speaker 0: It's 40 bucks.

356
00:19:40,963 --> 00:19:42,915
Speaker 1: Yup, but I've never paid for a PAX badge.

357
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:46,920
Speaker 0: I've never- You have bought any Penny Arcade merchandise at any time in your life other than those two t-shirts.

358
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,559
Speaker 1: I never actually paid you for the Penny Arcade books you got me.

359
00:19:50,201 --> 00:19:51,439
Speaker 0: Did I get you Penny Arcade books?

360
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,771
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's part of the DCVS thing.

361
00:19:53,892 --> 00:19:55,520
Speaker 1: It's part of that long running tab.

362
00:19:56,323 --> 00:19:57,248
Speaker 0: Sure.

363
00:19:58,616 --> 00:19:59,018
Speaker 0: Alrighty.

364
00:20:00,142 --> 00:20:01,280
Speaker 0: So, they don't owe me anything.

365
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:15,800
Speaker 0: The point is, I just want you to treat your customers, act professionally while simultaneously showing your customers, or at least being really convincing, that you actually are engaging your customers and taking them seriously.

366
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:18,575
Speaker 0: Don't do what the White House petitions do, right?

367
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:20,200
Speaker 1: Which is nothing.

368
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,480
Speaker 0: Exactly, right?

369
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:33,392
Speaker 0: Actually make us believe that if you're gonna pretend to have a conversation with us and talk to your customers, don't just, you know, sort of pretend to.

370
00:20:33,452 --> 00:20:34,638
Speaker 0: You have to actually do.

371
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,640
Speaker 0: And even if you don't do what we say, which would be nice if you did some of what we asked, right?

372
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:47,310
Speaker 0: At least, you know, if not all, at least, you know, don't just, you know, be quiet and be like, or freak out.

373
00:20:48,743 --> 00:20:49,900
Speaker 0: You guys don't know nothing.

374
00:20:51,401 --> 00:21:01,300
Speaker 0: You know, you gotta find that in between normal person dialogue so that, you know, we at least can respect you and you can respect us as human beings or we can believe that you're respecting us as human beings.

375
00:21:01,701 --> 00:21:06,179
Speaker 1: But if you have to be one of the two, I'd rather you be faceless corporate than- Than crazy guy, yeah.

376
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,980
Speaker 1: Than posting in the anime news network forums.

377
00:21:10,464 --> 00:21:11,018
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

378
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:19,318
Speaker 1: So things of the day!

379
00:21:19,358 --> 00:21:27,070
Speaker 1: It's anime day, it's a Wednesday, talking a little bit about anime, so I figured I would pull the old anime music video thing of the day.

380
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:38,070
Speaker 1: Because back in the day, when AMVs were still, not everyone could make them, and I used to actually go to AMV contests at cons because there wasn't really YouTube like we have it now.

381
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:41,750
Speaker 0: So you had no things of the day and all you could think of was the search for a music video that was old?

382
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:53,489
Speaker 1: Actually, no, I got a bunch of things of the day, but I specifically thought to look for an anime music video that was from a show that was way popular in American fandom and then was mostly forgotten by now.

383
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,530
Speaker 1: And I didn't know of any good Ranma ones.

384
00:21:57,390 --> 00:22:05,107
Speaker 1: I knew of a good Karakano one because that would have fit, but that video was actually super long and doesn't really live up to modern sensibilities.

385
00:22:05,127 --> 00:22:05,429
Speaker 1: that well.

386
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:10,090
Speaker 1: But this Escaflowne video is great primarily because it uses Megadeth.

387
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:11,410
Speaker 0: That's a good choice.

388
00:22:12,350 --> 00:22:13,447
Speaker 1: Spoilers for Escaflowne.

389
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:14,830
Speaker 0: Sure, whatever.

390
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:16,430
Speaker 1: It is, it's a pretty big spoiler.

391
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:18,495
Speaker 1: But it's a weird spoiler.

392
00:22:18,515 --> 00:22:25,537
Speaker 1: It's not a plot spoiler, it's like- Or you're just gonna be thinking, "What the fuck?

393
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:26,380
Speaker 1: Really?

394
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,206
Speaker 1: That's what happens in

395
00:22:28,246 --> 00:22:28,748
Speaker 1: Escaflowne?".

396
00:22:29,779 --> 00:22:30,429
Speaker 1: It's a pretty good video.

397
00:22:30,750 --> 00:22:40,169
Speaker 0: So, you may not know this, or you may, but it is currently the 20th anniversary of one of the best games, Wolfenstein 3D.

398
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:43,609
Speaker 1: I was never a big fan and I didn't get into FPSs until Doom.

399
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:46,430
Speaker 0: We know that you hate treasure and you love Nazis, right?

400
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:50,350
Speaker 0: But I like collecting treasure and killing Nazis, so I like this game.

401
00:22:51,031 --> 00:22:53,210
Speaker 0: And I'm playing it right now with the sound off.

402
00:22:53,951 --> 00:22:54,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, Freund Leven.

403
00:22:55,378 --> 00:22:56,182
Speaker 0: Oh shit, I don't even have the-.

404
00:22:56,403 --> 00:22:57,167
Speaker 0: Oh shit, I got the knife.

405
00:22:57,248 --> 00:22:57,670
Speaker 0: Oh snap.

406
00:22:58,430 --> 00:22:59,174
Speaker 0: Uh oh, uh oh.

407
00:22:59,778 --> 00:23:01,810
Speaker 0: Anyway, so you should play this game.

408
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:04,450
Speaker 1: It's just a maze game with some mediocre shooting.

409
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:11,490
Speaker 1: And while it was revolutionary for being effectively the first popular modern FPS, it wasn't really an FPS at all.

410
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:14,143
Speaker 1: Doom was the real revolution.

411
00:23:14,163 --> 00:23:15,470
Speaker 0: Doom 1.

412
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:19,010
Speaker 0: Anyway, so if you want to play this game, which you should, right?

413
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:23,010
Speaker 0: You could buy it on Steam for a very low price with all the expansions and everything, right?

414
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,725
Speaker 0: But there's also the shareware, which is just episode one.

415
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:29,090
Speaker 0: But you don't want to play that old shareware version, right?

416
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:35,230
Speaker 0: What you want to do, because you might be unsophisticated, is you want to go to this website here.

417
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:41,150
Speaker 0: Because it is now, because it's the anniversary, you can play this in your web browser.

418
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,270
Speaker 0: All episodes one, two, and three in the web browser.

419
00:23:46,071 --> 00:23:48,950
Speaker 0: I recommend you read the instructions if you can't figure out the controls.

420
00:23:49,693 --> 00:23:53,430
Speaker 0: It should be good for you people who don't have problems with the motion sickness.

421
00:23:53,850 --> 00:23:56,450
Speaker 0: Because there's no up and down, there's only left and right, and forward and back.

422
00:23:58,213 --> 00:23:59,379
Speaker 0: And you can kill Nazis.

423
00:24:00,506 --> 00:24:01,190
Speaker 0: And it's awesome.

424
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:08,090
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment, this weekend, Friday and Saturday, is ZenkaiCon, a convention in Pennsylvania.

425
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:15,808
Speaker 1: We'll be there doing a panel about Dubrow, the Dubrow from My Shit is Fucked Up So I Have to Shoot/Slice You Too.

426
00:24:15,868 --> 00:24:16,730
Speaker 1: It's Straight Up Dog Time.

427
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:18,590
Speaker 1: And My Little Pony.

428
00:24:19,330 --> 00:24:19,726
Speaker 0: And Nazis.

429
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:22,278
Speaker 1: We are also doing...

430
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,423
Speaker 0: I mean, God Wends Law, right?

431
00:24:26,463 --> 00:24:27,009
Speaker 0: We can't avoid it.

432
00:24:27,230 --> 00:24:32,369
Speaker 1: Doing motivational anime, which you may have seen at Anime Boston, where we also did it.

433
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:35,078
Speaker 1: After that, Otacon is coming up.

434
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,390
Speaker 1: It's up to them if we appear there.

435
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:40,169
Speaker 1: Because we submitted panels, as we do every year.

436
00:24:40,751 --> 00:24:43,810
Speaker 1: And we were accepted every year, up until they decided they hated us.

437
00:24:44,293 --> 00:24:46,709
Speaker 1: So, if you want us to be there, tell them.

438
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:51,930
Speaker 1: KineticCon is coming up, we will be there, running the panels department, and doing a bunch of our own stuff.

439
00:24:52,552 --> 00:24:56,950
Speaker 1: And, it's looking pretty good that Dave Riley is going to come and do some stuff too.

440
00:24:57,452 --> 00:24:58,970
Speaker 0: Oh shit son, it's on now.

441
00:24:59,871 --> 00:25:01,176
Speaker 1: I'm legit excited about that.

442
00:25:01,437 --> 00:25:04,750
Speaker 1: Fast Karate is one of the only podcasts I listen to.

443
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,763
Speaker 0: I just stopped listening to it, but I do not dislike it.

444
00:25:08,004 --> 00:25:09,150
Speaker 0: In fact, I like it a great deal.

445
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:11,210
Speaker 0: I just stopped listening to it, I don't know why.

446
00:25:11,250 --> 00:25:12,790
Speaker 1: You should listen to that Grimrock episode.

447
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:13,970
Speaker 0: What is Grimrock?

448
00:25:14,350 --> 00:25:17,289
Speaker 1: That's that game we were talking about a few days ago.

449
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,788
Speaker 0: Well, I never even heard of it.

450
00:25:19,833 --> 00:25:21,590
Speaker 1: With the boss that was weird.

451
00:25:22,532 --> 00:25:24,390
Speaker 0: How many games have weird bosses, like all of them?

452
00:25:24,671 --> 00:25:25,882
Speaker 1: The one that was crazy weird.

453
00:25:26,043 --> 00:25:26,729
Speaker 1: It was a giant cube.

454
00:25:28,173 --> 00:25:29,310
Speaker 0: Oh, that one!

455
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:31,408
Speaker 0: Spoilers, I guess.

456
00:25:32,855 --> 00:25:34,109
Speaker 0: I remember this conversation now.

457
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,870
Speaker 1: And the Penny Arcade Expo Prime will probably be there doing stuff.

458
00:25:38,273 --> 00:25:39,924
Speaker 1: And PAX Dev was announced.

459
00:25:39,985 --> 00:25:40,750
Speaker 1: It's actually happening.

460
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:42,910
Speaker 1: Though, they just took a wild update to the website.

461
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:46,409
Speaker 1: There's a decent chance at least one of us will be there.

462
00:25:47,552 --> 00:25:48,580
Speaker 1: And everything else can wait.

463
00:25:48,621 --> 00:25:49,830
Speaker 1: We don't have that many important announcements.

464
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,890
Speaker 0: Remember to go find us on the internet with all our internet things.

465
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:55,660
Speaker 0: The book club is 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami.

466
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:01,950
Speaker 1: A bunch of our panels, lectures, workshops and such are on my YouTube channel.

467
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,789
Speaker 1: You can just watch them.

468
00:26:03,131 --> 00:26:07,124
Speaker 0: Also, Google has a new hangout with on the air mode.

469
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,150
Speaker 0: We're gonna start using it.

470
00:26:11,311 --> 00:26:13,901
Speaker 0: Basically, it's like a Skype killer and a Ustream killer.

471
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:18,449
Speaker 1: Yeah, watch out kids.

472
00:26:18,751 --> 00:26:25,148
Speaker 0: If you wanna know what's going on with that, what you gotta do is you gotta get on Google+, even though you might be hating on it.

473
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:26,655
Speaker 0: And you gotta follow Geek Nights.

474
00:26:30,033 --> 00:26:35,068
Speaker 0: There's actually a Geek Nights page on Google+ that you can follow and add to your Google+-ness.

475
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:39,770
Speaker 1: Now, if you really don't want to, it looks like we can just stream this straight to YouTube as well.

476
00:26:41,312 --> 00:26:49,449
Speaker 1: We're either gonna make a dedicated YouTube account just for this, or we're gonna use my Geek Nights rim account because that's where every other video is.

477
00:26:49,690 --> 00:27:05,169
Speaker 0: Right, but the point is that there's going to be, you know, if you follow us on the internet, then you will be able to get these YouTube links to watch these streams and also records of any hangout on the air stuff we may do.

478
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:16,930
Speaker 1: And we'll get right to it, but one last thing I do want to point out, because people don't seem to realize this, every episode of Geek Nights going all the way back to October 31, 2005 is available on our website.

479
00:27:17,371 --> 00:27:19,429
Speaker 1: Every single one, you can download all of them.

480
00:27:20,834 --> 00:27:22,849
Speaker 1: And there's like 800-something episodes up there.

481
00:27:23,551 --> 00:27:27,209
Speaker 1: So if you ask us to do a show on a thing, at least search the website.

482
00:27:27,510 --> 00:27:28,238
Speaker 1: There's a decent chance.

483
00:27:28,299 --> 00:27:28,704
Speaker 1: we did it.

484
00:27:30,331 --> 00:27:39,130
Speaker 1: And if you're lucky, you might be able to find another 10 or so episodes of Beta Geek Nights that are also on the internet and actually pretty easy to find if you know where to look.

485
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:47,210
Speaker 0: One last meta thing, very quick, BarCamp NYC 7 is June 9, 2012 in the Microsoft offices.

486
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:51,790
Speaker 0: You want to go to, I think, barcampnyc.org to get all the info about that.

487
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,330
Speaker 0: I'm helping to organize it for the second year in a row.

488
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:55,410
Speaker 0: It's awesome.

489
00:27:56,030 --> 00:28:00,469
Speaker 0: If you are a technology person near New York City, you should be there.

490
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,225
Speaker 0: It's free.

491
00:28:02,670 --> 00:28:07,910
Speaker 1: So a long time ago, we'd go to anime cons like OhioCon and Anime Central and Otacon.

492
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,323
Speaker 1: We're talking like a decade ago, 2002 era.

493
00:28:12,632 --> 00:28:16,270
Speaker 1: And that was around the gigantic boom in American anime fans.

494
00:28:16,510 --> 00:28:18,209
Speaker 0: It wasn't really until '04-ish, but yeah.

495
00:28:19,391 --> 00:28:26,410
Speaker 1: You forget there was a pre-boom there where the cons were getting big and Suncoast and all these places were selling VHS like crazy.

496
00:28:27,031 --> 00:28:28,310
Speaker 1: DVDs were starting to get sold more and more.

497
00:28:28,371 --> 00:28:28,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was '03-'04.

498
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:33,410
Speaker 1: No, Suncoast was selling VHS well before that.

499
00:28:33,550 --> 00:28:40,250
Speaker 0: Well, yeah, but I'm saying the height of the boom, the height, the peak, the climax was a year or two later.

500
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:42,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, but this was during this huge anime bubble.

501
00:28:43,070 --> 00:28:43,409
Speaker 1: It was.

502
00:28:43,811 --> 00:28:44,928
Speaker 0: It was on the ramp up.

503
00:28:46,294 --> 00:28:46,810
Speaker 1: All right, anyway.

504
00:28:47,231 --> 00:28:51,949
Speaker 1: So in this era, go to any anime con, go talk to any anime fan.

505
00:28:52,770 --> 00:28:54,450
Speaker 1: And it was all like Ranma.

506
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,349
Speaker 1: They knew Ranma and Fushigi Yugi.

507
00:28:56,490 --> 00:29:02,030
Speaker 1: There were these shows that just like people, everybody knew you'd see so many people cosplaying as them.

508
00:29:02,130 --> 00:29:02,950
Speaker 1: It was ridiculous.

509
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,750
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were things that were crazy popular.

510
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:12,110
Speaker 0: And it seems that now you talk to the modern anime fans, you know, and it's like people don't even remember.

511
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,410
Speaker 0: Old school people know them, right?

512
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:21,770
Speaker 0: You know, but even then, they're not occupying a large space in the mind share of the old school people necessarily.

513
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:28,489
Speaker 1: But then again, what is occupying a large share of the mind scape in anime conventions today?

514
00:29:30,651 --> 00:29:32,110
Speaker 1: Homestuck, video games.

515
00:29:33,230 --> 00:29:34,047
Speaker 0: Portal and Homestuck.

516
00:29:35,470 --> 00:29:55,950
Speaker 1: I mean, not to go down that whole separate discussion of what an anime con should or should not be or any of that stuff, but there was definitely a very surprisingly homogenous fan base in that the people who were in the anime subculture or were watching a lot of anime had all seen mostly the same shows, at least among the big shows.

517
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,089
Speaker 1: Like, everyone had seen Ranma and knew what it was.

518
00:29:58,531 --> 00:29:59,790
Speaker 1: Everyone saw Fushigi Yugi.

519
00:30:00,190 --> 00:30:02,349
Speaker 1: Everybody cosplayed as Ranma and Fushigi Yugi.

520
00:30:03,191 --> 00:30:09,210
Speaker 1: And I remember when Fullmetal Alchemist was airing, people were going crazy about it.

521
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:13,669
Speaker 1: Everyone was cosplaying as-- it was the exact same thing in the exact same manner.

522
00:30:14,231 --> 00:30:19,189
Speaker 1: And I remember saying often in panels and lectures, and even just talking to people, that it was the same thing.

523
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:24,189
Speaker 1: And the argument I would usually get is no, Ranma's crap, or whatever show I was talking about was crap.

524
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,830
Speaker 1: Fullmetal Alchemist is a show for the ages.

525
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,837
Speaker 1: It is forever.

526
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:29,310
Speaker 1: It is the best show ever.

527
00:30:30,612 --> 00:30:34,790
Speaker 1: And if Brotherhood did not come out, Fullmetal Alchemist, I think, would be completely forgotten by this point.

528
00:30:35,676 --> 00:30:37,048
Speaker 0: I think it's forgotten, right?

529
00:30:37,512 --> 00:30:38,468
Speaker 0: People remember it.

530
00:30:39,750 --> 00:30:41,469
Speaker 0: So it doesn't really fit into this category.

531
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:45,449
Speaker 1: I mean, people who saw it remember it.

532
00:30:45,771 --> 00:30:55,290
Speaker 1: But think about how many of the people at anime cons now, ten years after when we started going, are younger and never even saw it when it was popular.

533
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,890
Speaker 1: Their first con was after its peak of popularity.

534
00:31:00,010 --> 00:31:05,190
Speaker 0: Yeah, I still think that was a show that was on Cartoon Network during the boomiest period.

535
00:31:06,150 --> 00:31:12,050
Speaker 0: Therefore, I think it's not-- It doesn't qualify, really, as a show that was a hit and is now forgotten.

536
00:31:12,090 --> 00:31:17,930
Speaker 0: It just was a hit and is now not as popular, but it's not a show that's forgotten, right?

537
00:31:18,470 --> 00:31:23,950
Speaker 0: Forgotten is like, you know, no one even talks about it anymore, but it used to be all over the place.

538
00:31:24,210 --> 00:31:29,197
Speaker 0: Like, imagine if ten years from now you went to a, you know, and it's just like, "Naruto?

539
00:31:29,418 --> 00:31:29,579
Speaker 0: What?

540
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,025
Speaker 0: Oh, I remember that.

541
00:31:31,126 --> 00:31:31,929
Speaker 0: Whoa.".

542
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,210
Speaker 1: Well, Scott, here's the problem with what you're saying.

543
00:31:34,591 --> 00:31:36,810
Speaker 1: So that's probably just a function of time.

544
00:31:37,050 --> 00:31:38,750
Speaker 0: Well, you know, it's a degree, right?

545
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,070
Speaker 0: And how can you even measure it, right?

546
00:31:40,110 --> 00:31:45,810
Speaker 0: The degree of how popular it was at the beginning compared to the degree of how much it has been forgotten.

547
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:51,269
Speaker 0: Clearly, Fullmetal Alchemist has been forgotten to a, you know, medium, if not large, degree.

548
00:31:51,910 --> 00:32:03,349
Speaker 1: But, you know, there are many, many other shows that weren't-- But it's also been much less time, and I am 100% sure-- Give it five more years, and Fullmetal Alchemist will be well on its way to Fushigi Yugi levels.

549
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,020
Speaker 0: Quite possible.

550
00:32:05,041 --> 00:32:05,750
Speaker 0: Quite possible.

551
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:06,276
Speaker 1: I would bet money.

552
00:32:06,398 --> 00:32:08,568
Speaker 1: I would bet a lot of money if anyone was willing to take that bet.

553
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:10,350
Speaker 0: If you're counting the first one, it's quite possible.

554
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:11,426
Speaker 1: Even the second one.

555
00:32:12,214 --> 00:32:12,506
Speaker 0: It's possible.

556
00:32:12,651 --> 00:32:13,288
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

557
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:18,109
Speaker 1: So we want to talk a little bit about those shows that-- I bet against you.

558
00:32:18,370 --> 00:32:23,510
Speaker 1: --had their day in the sun in America in popular, like, anime fandom culture.

559
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:29,748
Speaker 1: Like, the shows that, you know, if you said, like, you didn't know what the show was, or hadn't seen it, people would look at you weird.

560
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:36,735
Speaker 1: Like, people would be really surprised if, you know, back in, like, 2003, if you were like, "Kotocha?

561
00:32:36,755 --> 00:32:37,140
Speaker 1: Child's Toy?

562
00:32:37,161 --> 00:32:37,545
Speaker 1: What the hell's

563
00:32:37,586 --> 00:32:37,809
Speaker 1: that?".

564
00:32:38,112 --> 00:32:50,107
Speaker 0: Right, it's like, you'd go to the anime club library back in the day, like, the early 2000s, and you'd look through, and, you know, it's sort of like my brain would sort of categorize shows into "shows people know and shows people don't know," right?

565
00:32:51,110 --> 00:32:54,910
Speaker 0: So, you know, shows people knew would be those popular ones.

566
00:32:55,070 --> 00:32:56,370
Speaker 0: Like, Rama, people know that show.

567
00:32:56,592 --> 00:32:57,570
Speaker 0: Kaibiba, people know that show.

568
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,750
Speaker 0: Evangelion, people know that show.

569
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:02,349
Speaker 0: But then you'd see, like, you know, Kishinko, it's like, people don't know that show.

570
00:33:03,013 --> 00:33:03,317
Speaker 1: K.O.

571
00:33:03,398 --> 00:33:04,150
Speaker 1: Century Beast.

572
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,449
Speaker 0: People don't know that show.

573
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:05,798
Speaker 0: Kuu.

574
00:33:06,310 --> 00:33:07,250
Speaker 0: People don't know that show.

575
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,689
Speaker 1: No, we gotta do a show on that show.

576
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:09,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, we had to find it.

577
00:33:09,970 --> 00:33:10,567
Speaker 1: I know, I'll get it.

578
00:33:11,431 --> 00:33:15,730
Speaker 0: You know, so it's like, you would look through, and that was sort of the two most broad categories.

579
00:33:15,890 --> 00:33:17,529
Speaker 0: Shows people knew, shows people don't know.

580
00:33:17,890 --> 00:33:25,930
Speaker 0: But what's happened is, since then, you know, a lot of those shows people knew, right, have moved to the shows people don't know.

581
00:33:26,070 --> 00:33:27,850
Speaker 1: Now, you could argue this is just a function of time.

582
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,448
Speaker 0: Even though I know them.

583
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:39,610
Speaker 1: Because, you know, shows are stupidly popular and then fade from memory, and this is why, whenever we do one of those, like, C-equivalent panels, where we list a bunch of shows and tell people why they should or should not watch them.

584
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,109
Speaker 1: You know, it's an easy thing to do in a con.

585
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:57,230
Speaker 1: But look, but when we do it, we're very careful to always point out that we don't talk about a lot of recent shows, and we don't talk about them because it's very difficult to gauge how much staying power a show really has when you just watched it.

586
00:33:57,350 --> 00:34:02,348
Speaker 1: I mean, I loved the ever-living shit out of Fushigi Yugi when I was watching it.

587
00:34:03,113 --> 00:34:08,527
Speaker 1: And Lodos War, when I was, you know, a little kid, I thought that was one of the greatest things ever made by man.

588
00:34:09,831 --> 00:34:12,170
Speaker 0: Um, they don't all up that well.

589
00:34:12,690 --> 00:34:14,850
Speaker 0: Well, it's not even a question of whether they're good or not.

590
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:19,409
Speaker 0: It's just a question of somehow they've been, you know, not lost, like, we still have them.

591
00:34:19,831 --> 00:34:23,690
Speaker 0: But it's like, no one talks about them anymore, even though they were highly talked about.

592
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:29,248
Speaker 0: And I just, you know, look in other geekeries, I don't really see it happening so much.

593
00:34:29,772 --> 00:34:34,409
Speaker 1: That's actually, I was thinking about this show after we decided to do it, and that's kind of the road I was going down.

594
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:34,975
Speaker 0: Right?

595
00:34:35,034 --> 00:34:37,750
Speaker 0: Look at, let's go through the geekeries just one at a time quickly, right?

596
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:40,270
Speaker 0: So, superhero nerdy comic books, right?

597
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:43,409
Speaker 0: The big ones of the olden days are still remembered.

598
00:34:43,909 --> 00:34:46,050
Speaker 0: Secret Wars, Watchmen, right?

599
00:34:46,130 --> 00:34:47,078
Speaker 0: Watchmen's from 1986, it's remembered, right?

600
00:34:50,254 --> 00:34:55,110
Speaker 0: Whether the new fans or the old fans, they don't let the old hits get forgotten.

601
00:34:55,411 --> 00:34:57,570
Speaker 1: Now, remember, we're being very careful, old hits.

602
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:05,190
Speaker 1: There's tons of obscure and/or crap comics that no one remembers, but they were never hugely popular to begin with.

603
00:35:05,370 --> 00:35:07,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, Crisis on, you know, Infinite Earth.

604
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,136
Speaker 0: Guess what?

605
00:35:08,541 --> 00:35:09,006
Speaker 0: It's not lost.

606
00:35:10,072 --> 00:35:11,527
Speaker 1: People still remember that shit.

607
00:35:11,770 --> 00:35:16,369
Speaker 1: Now, American comics kind of cheat in that, who was a really important superhero from 40 years ago?

608
00:35:17,310 --> 00:35:17,545
Speaker 0: Name one.

609
00:35:17,791 --> 00:35:17,940
Speaker 0: Batman.

610
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,710
Speaker 1: All right, so, they've still got Batman and Superman.

611
00:35:22,231 --> 00:35:22,610
Speaker 0: Exactly, right.

612
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:26,930
Speaker 1: I mean, imagine if Ranma was just, like, still going.

613
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:30,090
Speaker 0: Then it wouldn't be forgotten, which is why, you know, look at Naruto in one piece.

614
00:35:30,090 --> 00:35:33,090
Speaker 1: Naruto was still going, but no one talked about it anymore.

615
00:35:33,651 --> 00:35:35,110
Speaker 0: You mean, like, the Ama Goddess manga?

616
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:40,130
Speaker 1: Yeah, like, imagine if, that's exactly the example I was going to use, I have to use a different one now.

617
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:54,570
Speaker 1: Imagine if, you know, Batman just wasn't, like, there were still Batman movies, like there are now, but, like, no one really talked about him, and other than older comic fans and older, like, cinema buffs, no one really, like, knew much about Batman.

618
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:57,427
Speaker 1: Like, they had heard of it, maybe, but they didn't know what it was.

619
00:35:57,961 --> 00:35:58,210
Speaker 1: Yeah.

620
00:35:58,350 --> 00:35:59,769
Speaker 1: But yet, we kept making Batman movies.

621
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:03,349
Speaker 1: I've found that James Bond is like that for a lot of punk kids.

622
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:06,770
Speaker 1: A lot of punk kids have never actually seen James Bond.

623
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:08,648
Speaker 0: They gotta get schooled by Dr.

624
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:08,749
Speaker 0: No.

625
00:36:10,018 --> 00:36:10,082
Speaker 0: No.

626
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,390
Speaker 1: I like Timothy Dalton.

627
00:36:11,410 --> 00:36:11,727
Speaker 0: Whatever.

628
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:14,910
Speaker 0: What James Bond movies was Timothy Dalton in?

629
00:36:15,110 --> 00:36:16,890
Speaker 1: He was in only one, right?

630
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:17,529
Speaker 1: Live and Let Die?

631
00:36:17,956 --> 00:36:18,188
Speaker 0: Nope.

632
00:36:18,417 --> 00:36:18,525
Speaker 0: No?

633
00:36:18,690 --> 00:36:19,289
Speaker 0: That's Roger Moore.

634
00:36:19,674 --> 00:36:20,429
Speaker 1: Oh, it was Roger Moore.

635
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:21,010
Speaker 1: All right.

636
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:22,769
Speaker 0: So, you don't even know.

637
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,750
Speaker 1: Because I didn't actually see the entire Timothy Dalton one.

638
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,110
Speaker 1: I saw it on cable during the James Bond marathon.

639
00:36:29,110 --> 00:36:31,229
Speaker 0: What even happens in the movie that he's in?

640
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:32,090
Speaker 1: Fuck if I don't remember.

641
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:32,500
Speaker 1: He was there.

642
00:36:32,771 --> 00:36:35,669
Speaker 0: So, you're saying that he's great, and you don't even know a goddamn thing about it.

643
00:36:35,750 --> 00:36:38,990
Speaker 1: I was saying he was great because he's the one that everyone says is bad.

644
00:36:39,353 --> 00:36:39,788
Speaker 0: He is bad.

645
00:36:39,951 --> 00:36:40,036
Speaker 0: Yeah.

646
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:45,630
Speaker 0: Anyway, and I think he might have been in two and not one, but one that he was definitely in was License to Kill.

647
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:47,140
Speaker 0: Anyway, I'm almost 100% sure of that.

648
00:36:48,930 --> 00:36:53,349
Speaker 1: All I know is the only time I ever saw him was during the marathon of all the James Bonds that happens every year.

649
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:55,190
Speaker 1: It was just on the TV in the background.

650
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:58,828
Speaker 1: I was sitting there playing a GBA, and that happened to be the one that was on.

651
00:36:59,050 --> 00:36:59,456
Speaker 1: I was like, "Who's

652
00:36:59,477 --> 00:36:59,761
Speaker 1: that?".

653
00:37:00,452 --> 00:37:00,941
Speaker 1: "Oh, that's James

654
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:01,246
Speaker 1: Bond.".

655
00:37:01,934 --> 00:37:03,043
Speaker 1: "Oh, that's Timothy

656
00:37:03,063 --> 00:37:03,506
Speaker 1: Dalton.".

657
00:37:04,315 --> 00:37:05,368
Speaker 0: I was indeed correct.

658
00:37:06,270 --> 00:37:07,570
Speaker 0: License to Kill, Timothy Dalton.

659
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,250
Speaker 0: IMDB rating, six and a half.

660
00:37:09,991 --> 00:37:11,050
Speaker 1: That's higher than I would expect it is.

661
00:37:11,070 --> 00:37:12,390
Speaker 0: He was also in the Living Daylights.

662
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:12,987
Speaker 0: He was in two.

663
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:14,303
Speaker 0: So, I was 100% correct.

664
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:18,150
Speaker 0: He was in two James Bond movies, both of which were not so good.

665
00:37:18,251 --> 00:37:18,462
Speaker 0: All right.

666
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:22,770
Speaker 0: So, anyway, let's go through some other geekery.

667
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:23,830
Speaker 0: So, we covered comic books.

668
00:37:24,636 --> 00:37:24,950
Speaker 1: Sports.

669
00:37:25,710 --> 00:37:32,807
Speaker 1: So, people still talk about the 1944 Cup, the Oilers, the Edmonton Oilers.

670
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:36,961
Speaker 0: There was a thread on Reddit hockey, and they were like, "Best hockey

671
00:37:37,002 --> 00:37:37,349
Speaker 0: moments."

672
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:37,928
Speaker 0: And you know what?

673
00:37:38,050 --> 00:37:39,950
Speaker 0: The videos were coming from all eras.

674
00:37:40,570 --> 00:37:43,570
Speaker 0: You know, the geekery, the hockey geeks do not forget any hockey.

675
00:37:45,334 --> 00:37:46,330
Speaker 0: Video games, right?

676
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:49,630
Speaker 0: People have not forgotten The Legend of Zelda, right?

677
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:53,090
Speaker 0: I mean, not a lot of people, you know, punk kids haven't played it when I talk to them.

678
00:37:53,293 --> 00:37:54,049
Speaker 0: But they know what it is.

679
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:55,130
Speaker 0: But they know it, right?

680
00:37:55,251 --> 00:37:58,390
Speaker 0: Even if they haven't played Mario 1, which I'm pretty sure everyone's played Mario 1.

681
00:37:58,390 --> 00:38:01,470
Speaker 1: Dude, adventure is like part of pop nerd culture.

682
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:02,910
Speaker 0: And it's not forgotten.

683
00:38:03,230 --> 00:38:05,550
Speaker 0: It's like, you know, how many people have played adventure?

684
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,524
Speaker 0: You go around, but if you hold up the duck, people are like, "It's the

685
00:38:08,565 --> 00:38:08,788
Speaker 0: duck.".

686
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,650
Speaker 1: Now, Scott, there are- Even though it's a dragon.

687
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:14,129
Speaker 1: Outlaw was a very popular game.

688
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:14,848
Speaker 0: Relatively.

689
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:19,570
Speaker 1: And it is completely forgotten, except by you, me, and the people who were at that PAX panel we ran.

690
00:38:20,371 --> 00:38:24,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean, you know, Kaboom was one of the top 10 selling Atari games, you know?

691
00:38:24,391 --> 00:38:26,350
Speaker 1: And there's only- And no one knows that anymore.

692
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,470
Speaker 1: Except for, like, hardcore video game people.

693
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,169
Speaker 0: So there is a little- Even though I can't play.

694
00:38:31,230 --> 00:38:32,650
Speaker 1: There is some of that in video games.

695
00:38:32,790 --> 00:38:37,310
Speaker 0: Right, but the thing is, it's not the A- It is the thing, right?

696
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:41,630
Speaker 0: The video games that were popular and forgotten weren't the A+ popular.

697
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:43,070
Speaker 0: They were the A- popular.

698
00:38:43,151 --> 00:38:43,810
Speaker 0: I'm gonna make a different point.

699
00:38:43,810 --> 00:38:45,210
Speaker 0: Or the B+ popular.

700
00:38:45,390 --> 00:38:49,690
Speaker 1: They were popular before an internet, which makes things very difficult.

701
00:38:51,132 --> 00:38:58,250
Speaker 1: Because, you know, now we have so much access to stuff, but these anime that were forgotten, there was internet the entire time.

702
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:03,250
Speaker 0: But the point is, video games that reached the peak level of popularity were not forgotten.

703
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:04,150
Speaker 1: Super Mario Brothers.

704
00:39:04,536 --> 00:39:07,589
Speaker 0: It was the ones that were- Dude, your grandma probably knows who Mario is.

705
00:39:07,671 --> 00:39:08,069
Speaker 0: Exactly.

706
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:11,110
Speaker 0: It's the ones that were popular for a short period.

707
00:39:11,250 --> 00:39:12,590
Speaker 0: Like, say, Primal Rage, right?

708
00:39:12,831 --> 00:39:19,328
Speaker 0: Was very popular, but it was a flash in the pan, and thus was forgotten, except by people who remember the dinosaur fighting game.

709
00:39:20,005 --> 00:39:20,210
Speaker 0: Right?

710
00:39:20,690 --> 00:39:30,930
Speaker 0: But in anime, these shows were A+ top popularity, at least in the US, among the fandom at the time.

711
00:39:31,373 --> 00:39:32,630
Speaker 0: There was nothing more popular.

712
00:39:32,951 --> 00:39:38,270
Speaker 1: I don't think you guys can understand how many Ranma ½ cosplayers and cosplay skits there were back then.

713
00:39:38,531 --> 00:39:41,950
Speaker 0: It was the most popular thing in the US fandom.

714
00:39:42,270 --> 00:39:43,988
Speaker 0: There was nothing more popular than it.

715
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:47,210
Speaker 0: It would be like if Portal was forgotten, right?

716
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,649
Speaker 0: Portal is the most popular video game now.

717
00:39:50,370 --> 00:39:51,926
Speaker 0: Imagine if people forgot it in 10 years.

718
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:57,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, if in 10 years, a guy cosplays as Portal, and one guy is like, "Oh my god, Portal.

719
00:39:57,590 --> 00:39:58,360
Speaker 1: Yeah, old

720
00:39:58,441 --> 00:39:58,967
Speaker 1: school.".

721
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,849
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's what it's like.

722
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:02,870
Speaker 0: So, any other geekeries left?

723
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,430
Speaker 0: We did comics, board games.

724
00:40:04,590 --> 00:40:05,810
Speaker 0: I guess it's sort of weird, right?

725
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,130
Speaker 0: I mean, the mega hits are sort of never forgotten.

726
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,349
Speaker 1: The idea of mega hits is relatively recent.

727
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:14,810
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Settlers is still hanging around, right?

728
00:40:14,830 --> 00:40:15,590
Speaker 0: It's not going anywhere.

729
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:16,289
Speaker 1: It's still well known.

730
00:40:16,391 --> 00:40:18,030
Speaker 1: But then again, El Grande was really popular.

731
00:40:18,291 --> 00:40:19,150
Speaker 1: No one knows that.

732
00:40:19,370 --> 00:40:20,809
Speaker 0: But it wasn't A+ popular.

733
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:21,576
Speaker 1: How do you know?

734
00:40:21,596 --> 00:40:22,350
Speaker 1: You don't know the numbers.

735
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,070
Speaker 1: You're just completely speculating.

736
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:27,049
Speaker 0: It's not as popular as Settlers Carcassonne, which is still around.

737
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:29,530
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it was when it was out.

738
00:40:29,590 --> 00:40:30,770
Speaker 0: And look how old Munchkin is.

739
00:40:30,850 --> 00:40:34,490
Speaker 0: We played that at RIT social night, and it's still hitting hard.

740
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,150
Speaker 0: Magic the Gathering is still hitting hard.

741
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:38,910
Speaker 0: At the same time, it's easy... Pokemon trading card games still hitting hard.

742
00:40:39,031 --> 00:40:40,850
Speaker 1: It's easy to cherry pick these examples.

743
00:40:41,131 --> 00:40:41,236
Speaker 0: It is.

744
00:40:41,911 --> 00:40:46,691
Speaker 0: I mean, Magic the Gathering was popular, think of a board game that was super, super popular, A+.

745
00:40:46,732 --> 00:40:47,970
Speaker 0: that is now forgotten.

746
00:40:48,130 --> 00:40:50,650
Speaker 1: See, you say A+, what exactly does that mean?

747
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:51,670
Speaker 1: We don't have the numbers.

748
00:40:51,710 --> 00:40:54,009
Speaker 0: As in, it is the most popular thing at the time.

749
00:40:54,511 --> 00:40:54,997
Speaker 1: Among who?

750
00:40:55,159 --> 00:40:56,050
Speaker 1: Just German gamers?

751
00:40:56,592 --> 00:40:57,450
Speaker 1: Just board gamers?

752
00:40:57,710 --> 00:41:00,230
Speaker 0: Among people who care about that particular geekery.

753
00:41:00,874 --> 00:41:02,268
Speaker 1: I think you're still cherry picking too much.

754
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,710
Speaker 0: Even Ranma was the most popular among anime fans, but among the general populace, it was nothing.

755
00:41:07,975 --> 00:41:08,190
Speaker 0: Yeah.

756
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:09,850
Speaker 0: At least in the US, right?

757
00:41:10,095 --> 00:41:10,770
Speaker 0: It was non-existent.

758
00:41:11,613 --> 00:41:14,789
Speaker 0: So, you know, we're talking about among the geeks, the geeks have forgotten it.

759
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,350
Speaker 1: Well, let's go through the animes first, then we'll get back to other examples.

760
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:20,109
Speaker 0: I think we proved the point, though.

761
00:41:21,152 --> 00:41:26,570
Speaker 0: This really hasn't happened as obviously in the other geekeries as it has in anime for some reason.

762
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,690
Speaker 1: Well, TV fandom.

763
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:35,290
Speaker 1: People who talk about TV in, like, sitcom forums or whatever, they still talk about the Andy Griffith Show, I Love Lucy, I Love Lucy Has Not Died.

764
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:40,870
Speaker 1: I've been watching the Andy Griffith Show every now and then on Netflix.

765
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:42,069
Speaker 0: Well, that's your jam.

766
00:41:42,392 --> 00:41:42,770
Speaker 0: You know what?

767
00:41:43,053 --> 00:41:44,528
Speaker 0: It holds up pretty well.

768
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:45,301
Speaker 1: It holds up.

769
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:50,370
Speaker 0: I've watched an episode or two in somewhat recent years, and it holds up about halfway.

770
00:41:50,810 --> 00:41:52,549
Speaker 1: It holds up as well as, like, the Cosby Show.

771
00:41:52,870 --> 00:41:53,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, or the Flintstones.

772
00:41:54,870 --> 00:41:57,150
Speaker 1: Eh, Flintstones is better than the Jetsons.

773
00:41:58,437 --> 00:41:59,085
Speaker 0: Uh, I mean...

774
00:41:59,672 --> 00:42:01,330
Speaker 1: I hated the Jetsons as a kid.

775
00:42:01,350 --> 00:42:02,709
Speaker 0: They're sort of equal-ish.

776
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:03,749
Speaker 1: I hated that family.

777
00:42:03,930 --> 00:42:04,729
Speaker 1: I hated Elroy.

778
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:06,690
Speaker 1: I watched it, but I didn't like them.

779
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:10,635
Speaker 0: Yeah, I do admit that in the Jet-- I mean, the thing is, right, in the Jetsons, it's sort of like.

780
00:42:10,675 --> 00:42:14,890
Speaker 0: I like all the future-y stuff, but, yeah, none of the characters are, like, really great.

781
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:19,710
Speaker 0: You know, you don't really like any of them super much, and at least on the Flintstones, you really like Barney.

782
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:20,390
Speaker 0: He's awesome.

783
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:24,470
Speaker 1: Yep, and Fred would cause some trouble, but he'd cause trouble because he was headstrong.

784
00:42:24,571 --> 00:42:25,570
Speaker 0: And Dino was pretty awesome.

785
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:28,110
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, George Jetson caused trouble because he's a spineless twit.

786
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:29,250
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway.

787
00:42:29,874 --> 00:42:30,170
Speaker 1: Anyway.

788
00:42:31,631 --> 00:42:33,870
Speaker 1: But, so, we keep saying Ranma.

789
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:35,267
Speaker 1: There are a lot of shows like this.

790
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:36,829
Speaker 1: Remember Fushigi Yugi?

791
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:37,350
Speaker 0: Yep.

792
00:42:37,431 --> 00:42:38,349
Speaker 1: How much of that did you watch?

793
00:42:39,032 --> 00:42:39,228
Speaker 0: Really?

794
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:42,630
Speaker 0: But I knew enough about it because it was that popular, right?

795
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:43,970
Speaker 0: You know, that I didn't even need it.

796
00:42:43,970 --> 00:42:46,390
Speaker 0: It was one of those shows-- That's how popular it was.

797
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:54,430
Speaker 0: You don't even understand that without seeing a single episode, without watching it ever, I knew a significant amount about it just because it was that popular.

798
00:42:55,074 --> 00:42:55,968
Speaker 0: You couldn't avoid it.

799
00:42:56,450 --> 00:43:02,129
Speaker 1: I remember hanging out with two Miyake cosplayers at Anime Central 2000 and I think three?

800
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:08,447
Speaker 0: This is when you go to your room and the craft store and you make the fastest-- Oh, my gosh, bro.

801
00:43:08,792 --> 00:43:10,609
Speaker 0: That you can possibly make.

802
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,970
Speaker 0: You did that once with the Oh My God Is Movie with your blue triangle, right?

803
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:15,469
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

804
00:43:15,570 --> 00:43:17,262
Speaker 1: So I took a piece with $3 in my wallet.

805
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:33,849
Speaker 1: I went to, I think, Joanne Fabrics and I bought one square yard of blue felt and then I took a white sheet that we had been using as a curtain in our kitchen at RIT and I wrapped it around myself and wore white pants under it.

806
00:43:34,412 --> 00:43:40,670
Speaker 1: I turned that piece of felt into the front half of this symbol and then I put something on my forehead.

807
00:43:42,910 --> 00:43:47,270
Speaker 1: But yeah, Fushigi Yugi was the jam back then to everybody.

808
00:43:47,370 --> 00:43:48,884
Speaker 1: And you know what, it's kind of a crappy--.

809
00:43:50,057 --> 00:43:50,869
Speaker 1: It does not hold up.

810
00:43:51,030 --> 00:43:53,128
Speaker 1: It is like 90s-ish anime to a T.

811
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:56,810
Speaker 0: I can't comment not having seen it or re-watched it, let alone watched it.

812
00:43:56,931 --> 00:44:06,805
Speaker 1: I have no desire to re-watch it, but if you had asked anyone in anime fandom at that time, they would have said that Fushigi Yugi was a show for the ages that we will talk about for 50 years.

813
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,650
Speaker 0: Well, could it be, right?

814
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,830
Speaker 0: The one thing that sets the anime apart from these other geekeries is that it was an imported anime, right?

815
00:44:14,490 --> 00:44:18,150
Speaker 0: Is that it was, you know, these things, anime has already existed going back to Astro Boy.

816
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:18,941
Speaker 1: Spaghetti Westerns.

817
00:44:20,390 --> 00:44:21,690
Speaker 0: That's true, right?

818
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,329
Speaker 0: But I mean, you know, an imported geekery that we were involved in.

819
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:25,729
Speaker 1: All right, so--.

820
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:34,570
Speaker 0: And the point is, right, so as we've discussed many times, right, the anime that we got early on was they were cherry-picking the best stuff.

821
00:44:35,070 --> 00:44:40,950
Speaker 0: So we had this sort of false impression that the anime was all good when they were just leaving the crap in Japan.

822
00:44:41,130 --> 00:44:53,030
Speaker 0: But at the same time, they would bring over some animes that were not the best, and we would watch them and really, really like them because we didn't really have much to compare it to.

823
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:56,530
Speaker 0: So any anime was awesome because what were you comparing it to, right?

824
00:44:56,931 --> 00:45:08,430
Speaker 0: It was like if I had a closet full of food, and in there was like foie gras but also cheesecake, and I gave you cheesecake and you said that is the best tasting thing in the universe, and that's because you didn't even know the foie gras was in the closet, right?

825
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:09,989
Speaker 0: You didn't even know it existed, right?

826
00:45:10,350 --> 00:45:14,330
Speaker 0: And then years later when everyone's eating foie gras, you've forgotten the cheesecake.

827
00:45:14,850 --> 00:45:20,190
Speaker 1: See, I would go with this except that I think the trend continues pretty much unabated.

828
00:45:21,110 --> 00:45:21,173
Speaker 0: Mmm.

829
00:45:21,872 --> 00:45:23,367
Speaker 1: So I don't think that's the cause.

830
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:29,570
Speaker 0: I think it is a factor on some of the shows because some of the shows, like say Fushigi Yugi, right?

831
00:45:29,850 --> 00:45:34,509
Speaker 0: They were liked in their day because, you know, you didn't have much to compare it to.

832
00:45:34,770 --> 00:45:36,590
Speaker 1: Well, like Lotoswar is I think a better example of that.

833
00:45:36,850 --> 00:45:45,910
Speaker 1: Lotoswar, to people who had seen, because Lotoswar was primarily picked up in America by people who had just watched like the sci-fi stuff.

834
00:45:46,230 --> 00:45:47,530
Speaker 1: They'd seen like Vampire Hunter.

835
00:45:47,750 --> 00:45:53,129
Speaker 0: And this was D&D to anime, so really compared to 70s D&D cartoon, oh shit son.

836
00:45:53,571 --> 00:45:59,129
Speaker 1: I mean, kids who had just gotten into anime saw Lotoswar and it looked to them amazing.

837
00:46:00,270 --> 00:46:03,069
Speaker 1: And Deedlet was the most beautiful thing they had ever seen.

838
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:09,370
Speaker 1: And like I remember I was desperate to see more of it because Blockbuster only had one VHS tape of it.

839
00:46:09,530 --> 00:46:12,750
Speaker 0: I remember I would go to the store and I would see this big row of VHS tapes.

840
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:15,209
Speaker 0: There were a lot of them and I was like, "Whatever that is, I want to watch

841
00:46:15,269 --> 00:46:15,310
Speaker 0: it.".

842
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:16,149
Speaker 0: I didn't even know what it was.

843
00:46:16,670 --> 00:46:17,876
Speaker 0: And I never did.

844
00:46:17,896 --> 00:46:20,610
Speaker 0: I only watched that OAV one that was on a single DVD.

845
00:46:20,910 --> 00:46:30,727
Speaker 1: I remember trying to convince my parents to buy... A DVD player when DVD had first come out because Lotoswar on VHS was like over $200 to get all of it.

846
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:39,190
Speaker 1: The Boxset DVD, one of the first DVDs of anime to be released in the US as far as I can tell, was like $100.

847
00:46:39,190 --> 00:46:45,947
Speaker 1: I was like, "Mom, you'll save money if you just buy me a DVD player and that anime instead of buying me just the

848
00:46:46,027 --> 00:46:46,348
Speaker 1: anime.".

849
00:46:48,213 --> 00:46:49,930
Speaker 1: Except DVD players were still really expensive.

850
00:46:50,090 --> 00:46:53,076
Speaker 0: The thing is, people don't realize how recent DVD is.

851
00:46:53,096 --> 00:46:54,860
Speaker 0: In 2001, which was 11 years ago, the PS2 was coming out.

852
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:01,887
Speaker 0: We were at RIT.

853
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:06,645
Speaker 1: And people were saying, "Oh man, if you get a PS2, it comes with a DVD player.

854
00:47:06,706 --> 00:47:07,669
Speaker 1: Holy shit, you can watch

855
00:47:07,689 --> 00:47:07,769
Speaker 1: DVDs.".

856
00:47:08,171 --> 00:47:12,729
Speaker 0: It was 2000 or 2001 and we were like, "Holy shit, we gotta get that PS2 at the casino

857
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:12,930
Speaker 0: night.".

858
00:47:14,171 --> 00:47:17,890
Speaker 0: And we put all our fake money together and put it all on black and lost.

859
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:22,369
Speaker 0: If we would have won, it would have come out black, we would have had a PS2 to share amongst us.

860
00:47:22,690 --> 00:47:24,310
Speaker 1: And then it would have been that episode of The Simpsons.

861
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:25,127
Speaker 0: That's right.

862
00:47:26,730 --> 00:47:28,736
Speaker 1: We're getting off on a tangent of DVD players.

863
00:47:29,198 --> 00:47:33,030
Speaker 1: I don't want to talk about that special DVD player we had.

864
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:40,620
Speaker 0: But the idea is, some of these shows, the reason that they were super popular and forgotten is that they were incorrectly popular because...

865
00:47:48,712 --> 00:47:50,909
Speaker 1: But now is like the third or fourth tallest at the park.

866
00:47:50,990 --> 00:47:56,270
Speaker 0: They are no longer the tallest rollercoaster and that is why they are not given as much attention as they used to be.

867
00:47:56,570 --> 00:48:02,850
Speaker 0: But, some shows are actually the tallest rollercoaster and have been forgotten and are deserving of writing and attention.

868
00:48:02,850 --> 00:48:03,633
Speaker 0: Alright, so what's the show?

869
00:48:03,653 --> 00:48:06,003
Speaker 1: that is an A anime that's been forgotten?

870
00:48:06,064 --> 00:48:07,450
Speaker 1: I got a bunch, but what's your example?

871
00:48:07,610 --> 00:48:10,650
Speaker 0: Well, the one we just brought up was His and Her Circumstances, right?

872
00:48:10,710 --> 00:48:12,570
Speaker 1: Kare Kano, who remembers that?

873
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:15,603
Speaker 0: I only watched half that show and it was the awesomest.

874
00:48:15,664 --> 00:48:16,970
Speaker 0: I don't know why I didn't finish it.

875
00:48:17,930 --> 00:48:18,557
Speaker 1: I really liked it.

876
00:48:18,618 --> 00:48:19,063
Speaker 1: That show...

877
00:48:19,670 --> 00:48:21,670
Speaker 0: That was like the Gainax show, right?

878
00:48:22,070 --> 00:48:23,510
Speaker 1: After, you know, Ava and that.

879
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:31,210
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's like, you know, people now, you talk about Gainax, they'll be talking about FLC, or you know, all this other stuff.

880
00:48:31,370 --> 00:48:36,488
Speaker 1: Not saying those shows aren't great, but Kare Kano, I don't think... I would wager if we were an anime con, maybe...

881
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:39,190
Speaker 0: I think I might just go watch it and then we'll do a show on it.

882
00:48:39,210 --> 00:48:41,790
Speaker 1: Maybe one or two people will raise their hands if we brought up Kare Kano.

883
00:48:42,314 --> 00:48:43,102
Speaker 0: Only the old school.

884
00:48:43,465 --> 00:48:43,909
Speaker 0: No one else.

885
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,969
Speaker 1: I mean, if we're talking about... I don't know if it was an A anime, though.

886
00:48:48,256 --> 00:48:48,420
Speaker 1: A?

887
00:48:48,482 --> 00:48:50,490
Speaker 1: Mmm... I think it's a B. I think it's a good B. I liked it.

888
00:48:50,530 --> 00:48:51,079
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

889
00:48:51,120 --> 00:48:51,730
Speaker 1: I gotta watch it again.

890
00:48:51,750 --> 00:48:52,530
Speaker 1: I'd have to watch it again.

891
00:48:53,210 --> 00:48:56,090
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did a show on why you have to watch it again before you judge it.

892
00:48:56,535 --> 00:48:57,089
Speaker 0: Let's watch it again.

893
00:48:57,491 --> 00:48:58,150
Speaker 1: Alright, alright.

894
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:02,130
Speaker 1: But like, uh, Irresponsible Captain Tyler, I think it's A anime.

895
00:49:02,350 --> 00:49:02,867
Speaker 0: That's A for you.

896
00:49:03,794 --> 00:49:04,950
Speaker 1: I think it's A for everyone.

897
00:49:05,172 --> 00:49:05,830
Speaker 0: I gotta watch it again.

898
00:49:05,911 --> 00:49:06,940
Speaker 0: You do.

899
00:49:07,061 --> 00:49:08,030
Speaker 1: I will stand by it being A.

900
00:49:08,030 --> 00:49:09,990
Speaker 0: But that is most definitely forgotten.

901
00:49:10,312 --> 00:49:13,190
Speaker 1: Scott, I'll bet you a hundred bucks that you will say it's A after you watch it.

902
00:49:13,970 --> 00:49:14,327
Speaker 1: Two hundred.

903
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:15,050
Speaker 1: Maybe.

904
00:49:15,230 --> 00:49:15,670
Speaker 1: Five hundred.

905
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:15,915
Speaker 1: Sure.

906
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:17,590
Speaker 1: Five thousand dollars.

907
00:49:17,911 --> 00:49:18,409
Speaker 0: Okay, sure.

908
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:19,209
Speaker 0: Really?

909
00:49:19,732 --> 00:49:20,089
Speaker 0: Whatever.

910
00:49:20,950 --> 00:49:23,370
Speaker 1: Actually, I don't want to take that bet because I'm a hundred percent sure you will.

911
00:49:23,890 --> 00:49:24,019
Speaker 1: Anyway.

912
00:49:25,290 --> 00:49:29,250
Speaker 1: But, um, I think there's a completely different factor here that I've been mulling over.

913
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:40,550
Speaker 1: Anime fandom, more so than any other stereotypically geeky or nerdy fandom in the United States, has a ludicrously higher churn rate.

914
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:41,929
Speaker 1: Or turnover rate.

915
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:45,109
Speaker 1: I think more so than almost any other hobby in America right now.

916
00:49:45,590 --> 00:49:58,068
Speaker 1: People get into anime, go to anime cons, have this huge, like, anime sort of, like, honeymoon, and then get out of anime and stop going to anime cons and watch it occasionally on the internet.

917
00:49:58,088 --> 00:49:58,450
Speaker 1: and that's it.

918
00:49:58,891 --> 00:50:00,630
Speaker 1: Like, they disengage from the fan culture.

919
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:05,629
Speaker 1: So I think the people do find, like, Ranma and watch it.

920
00:50:06,072 --> 00:50:08,770
Speaker 1: But those people don't go to cons anymore so we never see them.

921
00:50:09,030 --> 00:50:11,610
Speaker 1: They don't participate in anime culture anymore so we don't talk to them.

922
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:23,850
Speaker 0: Right, there is no question that there are a large number of people who read anime, who watch anime, or even sometimes read manga and comics and such, but they are not in that culture, right?

923
00:50:24,190 --> 00:50:28,010
Speaker 0: Walking Dead keeps selling trades like crazy non-stop.

924
00:50:28,751 --> 00:50:30,789
Speaker 0: Those people are not comic book gang.

925
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:32,650
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, but I'm making a separate point.

926
00:50:32,770 --> 00:50:38,770
Speaker 0: There are people at my work who, they watch an anime or two on the Hulu's and such, but are they anime fans?

927
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:40,258
Speaker 0: Would they ever go to an anime con?

928
00:50:40,278 --> 00:50:42,410
Speaker 0: Do they actually know anything about anime?

929
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:43,710
Speaker 0: Not really.

930
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:44,750
Speaker 1: But I'm not talking about them.

931
00:50:44,830 --> 00:50:46,560
Speaker 1: I'm making a much more specific point.

932
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:48,250
Speaker 1: that has, I think, deeper consequences.

933
00:50:48,871 --> 00:50:53,690
Speaker 1: I think these are people who became self-identified anime fans.

934
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:54,408
Speaker 0: So they got in.

935
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:56,829
Speaker 0: See, I was talking about the people who were never in.

936
00:50:57,110 --> 00:50:58,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I'm making a separate point.

937
00:50:58,911 --> 00:51:11,570
Speaker 1: I'm saying there are people who started going to anime cons, got really into anime, but then as they continued to be into anime, they disengaged from anime fan culture for a variety of reasons.

938
00:51:12,290 --> 00:51:14,741
Speaker 1: So those people all eventually do fine.

939
00:51:14,781 --> 00:51:16,810
Speaker 1: Ranma and all these other, you know...

940
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:17,449
Speaker 0: Well, they might.

941
00:51:17,932 --> 00:51:18,828
Speaker 1: I think a lot of them do.

942
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:24,730
Speaker 1: And also, the old comic book guy is still there at every comic con.

943
00:51:24,770 --> 00:51:25,126
Speaker 1: He is.

944
00:51:25,371 --> 00:51:29,970
Speaker 1: But not nearly as many of the old anime guys are at every anime con.

945
00:51:30,339 --> 00:51:30,570
Speaker 0: That's true.

946
00:51:30,930 --> 00:51:52,008
Speaker 1: So the avenues for new fans to discover the old things are less in anime because the people who would mentor them no longer engage with the fandom in a way that they would run into them, coupled with the fact that I've met a lot of people and seen a lot of people who self-identified as anime fans and then pointedly self-identified as no longer an anime

947
00:51:52,088 --> 00:51:52,410
Speaker 0: fan.

948
00:51:53,713 --> 00:51:55,310
Speaker 0: Even though they may watch anime still.

949
00:51:55,490 --> 00:51:57,458
Speaker 1: Yes, but they disengage.

950
00:51:57,499 --> 00:52:00,150
Speaker 1: They don't want anything to do with anime culture, anime fandom.

951
00:52:00,411 --> 00:52:01,810
Speaker 1: They just watch anime on their own.

952
00:52:02,171 --> 00:52:07,169
Speaker 0: See, this is actually something else that's sort of unique to our particular situation, but you just sort of realized, right?

953
00:52:08,393 --> 00:52:11,410
Speaker 0: Even though we were in that generation that saw anime on the sci-fi channel...

954
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:14,430
Speaker 1: Dude, we ran the biggest anime club in North America for years.

955
00:52:14,710 --> 00:52:25,970
Speaker 0: I'm just saying, even though we were in the generation that watched on the sci-fi channel, we were not the true old school people who were watching Star Blazers and Robotech on UHF.

956
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,067
Speaker 0: Those are the real old school U.S.

957
00:52:28,108 --> 00:52:28,330
Speaker 0: people.

958
00:52:28,430 --> 00:52:30,330
Speaker 0: We were not there with a line of VCRs.

959
00:52:30,850 --> 00:52:32,049
Speaker 1: No, we were the next school.

960
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,210
Speaker 0: We were the next school.

961
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:36,470
Speaker 1: We were the end of the VHS fansubs, like SVHS days.

962
00:52:36,890 --> 00:52:52,310
Speaker 0: But because when we got into the anime fandom, that one school older than us was still there to show us the way, and that is how we absorbed both schools and also the future schools.

963
00:52:52,611 --> 00:52:55,607
Speaker 1: I mean, I would go to the anime club library and I'd be like, "What should I

964
00:52:55,647 --> 00:52:55,928
Speaker 1: watch?".

965
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:00,263
Speaker 1: and someone older than me would be like, "Watch this.

966
00:53:00,845 --> 00:53:01,447
Speaker 1: What's it about?

967
00:53:01,607 --> 00:53:01,908
Speaker 1: Watch

968
00:53:01,989 --> 00:53:02,049
Speaker 1: it.".

969
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,321
Speaker 1: But watch it.

970
00:53:03,382 --> 00:53:03,969
Speaker 1: And I'd watch it.

971
00:53:04,590 --> 00:53:05,509
Speaker 1: And they were usually right.

972
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:13,050
Speaker 1: And there was this continuation of the culture, which in comic fandom in America is almost too strong.

973
00:53:13,994 --> 00:53:17,450
Speaker 1: But in anime fandom, I think that continuity of culture is broken.

974
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:20,910
Speaker 1: I think it's absolutely at the edge of being completely broken.

975
00:53:21,490 --> 00:53:24,270
Speaker 1: And to use a personal anecdote, I'll be honest.

976
00:53:24,630 --> 00:53:35,908
Speaker 1: If we were not sort of industry press people, if we were not doing geek nights, being pressed, commenting, performing, I probably would have stopped going to anime cons like four years ago.

977
00:53:36,735 --> 00:53:37,470
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably.

978
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,550
Speaker 1: Because there's nothing for me at them that's related to anime.

979
00:53:41,691 --> 00:53:49,550
Speaker 1: I mean, Daryl Surratt and Mike Tool and all these people do great stuff, but we know a lot of what they know, the things they show me.

980
00:53:49,710 --> 00:53:50,990
Speaker 0: Because they've told it to us already.

981
00:53:51,330 --> 00:53:51,472
Speaker 1: Yes.

982
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:56,850
Speaker 1: Or they're things that I already know, or things that I'll find out as I'm researching that thing, and vice versa.

983
00:53:57,030 --> 00:54:00,170
Speaker 1: I'm not going to say anything that Daryl Surratt doesn't already know about anime.

984
00:54:00,410 --> 00:54:00,750
Speaker 0: That's for sure.

985
00:54:01,770 --> 00:54:05,870
Speaker 1: So there's no one to show me any mysteries because I've plumbed a lot of the mysteries.

986
00:54:07,751 --> 00:54:13,330
Speaker 1: And beyond that, the fan culture has nothing for me anymore.

987
00:54:14,230 --> 00:54:17,050
Speaker 1: And it's not just because of the age difference.

988
00:54:17,530 --> 00:54:30,730
Speaker 1: Because the age difference between us, you know, 30s, and the punk kids at anime cons now, 14, is not bigger than the difference between us when we were in our 20s, and the 40 and 50 year old guys who were at the cons telling us what to watch.

989
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:31,348
Speaker 0: That's right.

990
00:54:32,731 --> 00:54:41,610
Speaker 0: Even though a lot of what we were told was not by 40 and 50 year old guys at cons, but by, you know, we were 18 and 25 year old guys at anime club were telling us.

991
00:54:41,730 --> 00:54:43,348
Speaker 1: But I got a lot from cons too.

992
00:54:43,611 --> 00:54:44,067
Speaker 0: We got some.

993
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,090
Speaker 1: And I think there was a continuity of the con culture.

994
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:51,630
Speaker 0: And also when we would go to the con dealer's room, right, it wasn't just all Naruto headbands, right?

995
00:54:52,332 --> 00:54:57,790
Speaker 0: Basically all they had in those days was old school stuff, and you would learn just looking around what was going on.

996
00:54:57,950 --> 00:54:58,071
Speaker 1: Yep.

997
00:54:58,132 --> 00:54:59,650
Speaker 1: You'd see that blonde woman everywhere.

998
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,328
Speaker 1: Like, who's that?

999
00:55:00,470 --> 00:55:08,870
Speaker 1: And then you'd learn about, like, Mattel and all that, you know, Arcadia skies of Matsumoto verse three, nine, nine galaxies.

1000
00:55:09,350 --> 00:55:09,431
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1001
00:55:09,451 --> 00:55:11,349
Speaker 0: You see stuff and you try to figure out what it is.

1002
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,749
Speaker 0: Now you have to dig in the dealer's room to find any old stuff.

1003
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:29,790
Speaker 1: But I think that this phenomenon is universal to all things that are in any way related to popular culture, even within, you know, within subcultures, they have their own popular cultures, like in those universes, in those fish bowls.

1004
00:55:30,452 --> 00:55:35,490
Speaker 1: I think this idea of things are super popular when they fade out, I mean, fads, it happens.

1005
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:49,710
Speaker 1: I just think, I posit to you, this is barely a hypothesis, that anime fandom in America specifically has this problem in order of magnitude or more greater than any other equivalent fandom.

1006
00:55:51,032 --> 00:55:54,810
Speaker 1: And I have some theories as to why, and that's all I got for you.

1007
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:55,467
Speaker 0: Yep.

1008
00:55:56,271 --> 00:56:07,690
Speaker 1: I mean, it amazes me, like, we'll do an anime you should see panel at an anime con, and I'd say 90% of the people have not seen anime that I would consider kind of, like, basic?

1009
00:56:08,992 --> 00:56:11,409
Speaker 1: And I don't think I'm unjustified in saying that they're basic.

1010
00:56:12,150 --> 00:56:19,350
Speaker 1: You're like going to a film convention, being like, so I don't think I need to tell you all to watch Citizen Kane, and three quarters of the audience are like, Citizen who?

1011
00:56:20,112 --> 00:56:20,201
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1012
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:20,561
Speaker 1: What?

1013
00:56:23,132 --> 00:56:33,469
Speaker 0: So yeah, we should, you know, you should go out, and if you are one of those younger fans who has not been mentored by the old, you probably can't possibly be in that category because you already listen to the show.

1014
00:56:33,970 --> 00:56:41,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I want to hear your comments and anecdotes, I want to figure out if there is something to this, if there is something different about anime fandom.

1015
00:56:41,871 --> 00:56:49,449
Speaker 1: My strongest hypothesis is that it has to do with the churn of anime fans engaging in anime fan culture, so we can't see.

1016
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:52,930
Speaker 1: It's like under the radar, off the radar anime fans.

1017
00:56:53,090 --> 00:57:05,059
Speaker 0: I also want to put together a list of shows, right, that not even the A shows, right, that were forgotten, but also sort of the shows that were moderately popular, you know, 10, 12, 15 years ago, that have now disappeared.

1018
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:08,137
Speaker 0: Shows that are sort of like.

1019
00:57:08,198 --> 00:57:09,750
Speaker 0: on that, you know, you're under arrest level.

1020
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:12,850
Speaker 1: I was going to say YUA is probably the poster child of that.

1021
00:57:12,930 --> 00:57:16,470
Speaker 0: It was like about these two police girls, and back in the day it was kind of popular.

1022
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:18,730
Speaker 1: Kind of popular, it was, like everyone knew that show.

1023
00:57:18,851 --> 00:57:21,150
Speaker 0: Everyone at the anime club knew that show, at least.

1024
00:57:21,210 --> 00:57:22,670
Speaker 1: Yeah, everyone at an anime club knew that show.

1025
00:57:22,670 --> 00:57:34,170
Speaker 0: I haven't heard anyone else really mention it outside the anime club, but it's like, it was moderately popular, you know, I know some people were super fans of it, big time, and now you don't hear about that show at all.

1026
00:57:34,411 --> 00:57:35,490
Speaker 0: It is gone.

1027
00:57:35,850 --> 00:57:39,949
Speaker 1: Marmalade Boy, Kimiguri, Orange Road, we already talked about Caricano.

1028
00:57:40,250 --> 00:57:51,688
Speaker 0: The quality of these shows you could debate over, right, are they good or bad, but the point is, they had some level of popularity, you know, in the past, and now they are effectively disappeared, at least in the U.S.

1029
00:57:51,729 --> 00:57:59,670
Speaker 0: culture, and I imagine, I don't know for sure in Japan, but I'm pretty sure, you know, a good guess, no one in Japan is talking about, you know, Marmalade Boy.

1030
00:57:59,930 --> 00:58:02,429
Speaker 1: Ah, but Scott, how many people remember, I mean, Wings?

1031
00:58:04,453 --> 00:58:05,109
Speaker 0: What do you mean Wings?

1032
00:58:05,673 --> 00:58:06,949
Speaker 1: It's a sitcom from America.

1033
00:58:07,370 --> 00:58:08,270
Speaker 0: Oh, I was thinking of anime.

1034
00:58:08,450 --> 00:58:09,490
Speaker 0: That was moderately popular.

1035
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:14,170
Speaker 0: I only know it existed because it was on after a show, or before a show that I wanted to watch.

1036
00:58:14,170 --> 00:58:22,925
Speaker 1: That's just pop culture stuff, but you know, those shows are all forgotten, and the only ones that are going to be remembered in the long run are things like, you know, the classics, the Andy Griffith Show, The Simpsons.

1037
00:58:23,310 --> 00:58:25,290
Speaker 0: I'm surprised people remember 21 Jump Street.

1038
00:58:26,653 --> 00:58:28,989
Speaker 1: I don't think most people know that it's based on a show.

1039
00:58:30,295 --> 00:58:31,269
Speaker 0: Oh, you think it's like that.

1040
00:58:31,571 --> 00:58:39,570
Speaker 1: I think the only people who know it's based on the show are people who are 30 or older, and 30 is probably, like, literally the youngest person.

1041
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:41,363
Speaker 0: You think anyone's going to see Prometheus?

1042
00:58:41,383 --> 00:58:42,170
Speaker 0: who hasn't seen Alien?

1043
00:58:42,852 --> 00:58:45,870
Speaker 1: I think almost, I think the majority of people.

1044
00:58:45,890 --> 00:58:46,717
Speaker 0: I think half.

1045
00:58:49,352 --> 00:58:50,970
Speaker 1: I'm going to say half the people who go see Prometheus.

1046
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:55,042
Speaker 0: If I owned a movie theater, I'd go in before the movie, I'd be like, "Raise your hand if you have not seen

1047
00:58:55,123 --> 00:58:55,446
Speaker 0: Alien.".

1048
00:58:56,570 --> 00:58:56,738
Speaker 1: "Aliens.".

1049
00:58:57,673 --> 00:59:09,710
Speaker 1: Ah, so thus, something I want to say about anime cons, because I think we could fix this, if you think it's a problem, pretty easily, by doing something very simple at anime cons.

1050
00:59:09,790 --> 00:59:10,910
Speaker 1: You don't have to change anything.

1051
00:59:11,270 --> 00:59:16,150
Speaker 1: Let the Homestuck kids run around and have their, like, gay pony panels, whatever it is they want, who cares?

1052
00:59:17,072 --> 00:59:21,965
Speaker 1: All you have to do, this is the thing that we tried to push through at Otacon, which is one of the reasons they kicked us off.

1053
00:59:22,026 --> 00:59:33,169
Speaker 1: the staff, as far as I can tell, have screening rooms, show anime, have those showings be curated, and have someone who knows what they're talking about introduce a show.

1054
00:59:33,410 --> 00:59:34,870
Speaker 0: But those kids are never going to come in that room.

1055
00:59:35,091 --> 00:59:40,328
Speaker 1: I think they would, if you didn't schedule them as, you know, "Kare Kanno Episode

1056
00:59:40,328 --> 00:59:40,692
Speaker 1: 1.".

1057
00:59:40,692 --> 00:59:41,588
Speaker 1: No one's going to go to that.

1058
00:59:42,273 --> 00:59:48,569
Speaker 1: If you schedule this as fucking robot shows, people will show up there just to see what's up.

1059
00:59:48,690 --> 00:59:49,489
Speaker 0: Someone might show up.

1060
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:50,307
Speaker 1: I think people would.

1061
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,430
Speaker 1: Shows your mom wouldn't let you watch.

1062
00:59:52,931 --> 00:59:54,830
Speaker 1: Old stuff you probably should have watched.

1063
00:59:55,250 --> 00:59:57,169
Speaker 1: Stuff you probably didn't think you'd like.

1064
00:59:58,155 --> 00:59:59,349
Speaker 1: And you show them Princess Tutu.

1065
01:00:00,394 --> 01:00:03,809
Speaker 1: And you have someone actually explain, like, "So here's the deal with this show.

1066
01:00:04,192 --> 01:00:05,230
Speaker 1: Here's why this show...".

1067
01:00:05,291 --> 01:00:06,570
Speaker 0: Yep, it's the old idea.

1068
01:00:06,991 --> 01:00:09,430
Speaker 1: The old idea we've been pitching for six years.

1069
01:00:09,430 --> 01:00:11,789
Speaker 0: Maybe use one of our too many Kineticon rooms and do it.

1070
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,910
Speaker 1: Because that's the screenings department.

1071
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:14,879
Speaker 1: I don't want to get involved.

1072
01:00:16,611 --> 01:00:17,628
Speaker 1: I've got enough to deal with.

1073
01:00:18,431 --> 01:00:22,070
Speaker 1: Also, I don't have time to personally curate that.

1074
01:00:22,291 --> 01:00:24,089
Speaker 0: I could do one room for three days.

1075
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:28,710
Speaker 1: Yeah, you have other duties, captain, like head of operations for panels and workshops.

1076
01:00:29,291 --> 01:00:30,228
Speaker 0: I'll just quit that job.

1077
01:00:31,374 --> 01:00:34,189
Speaker 1: If you quit that job, I swear to God, I'll punch you in the eyeball.

1078
01:00:34,712 --> 01:00:35,286
Speaker 0: Anyway, let's...

1079
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:35,909
Speaker 1: The left one.

1080
01:00:38,078 --> 01:00:39,109
Speaker 0: Let's go and finish the show.

1081
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,490
Speaker 1: I think we're pretty much done.

1082
01:00:40,730 --> 01:00:43,899
Speaker 1: We've had our rambly, old timer, "Back in my

1083
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:44,224
Speaker 1: day!".

1084
01:00:44,872 --> 01:00:51,850
Speaker 1: Thing is, back in our day, you know, the old anime cons, there was still punk kids running around yelling and screaming.

1085
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:53,510
Speaker 1: A lot of that stuff hasn't changed that much.

1086
01:00:54,010 --> 01:01:01,330
Speaker 1: I think the only thing that's changed is that back then, the older people were still there in force next to the younger people.

1087
01:01:01,590 --> 01:01:02,749
Speaker 0: There were also less people total.

1088
01:01:03,011 --> 01:01:22,370
Speaker 1: Yeah, but even as Otakon started getting gigantic, when they took over the whole BCC and all that, there was a wider range of ages represented more equally, and I feel like it's skewing younger and younger, and meanwhile, the other bubble of the older anime fans are just leaving.

1089
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:25,545
Speaker 1: And we could do a whole show on why.

1090
01:01:25,586 --> 01:01:26,070
Speaker 1: I think that is.

1091
01:01:26,130 --> 01:01:27,489
Speaker 1: We might have already done a show on that.

1092
01:01:27,930 --> 01:01:38,709
Speaker 1: But I think that, in my opinion, that disconnect in the anime culture and anime fandom is the primary reason why we're seeing so many very popular shows forgotten so quickly.

1093
01:01:39,170 --> 01:01:40,327
Speaker 0: The memory is not being passed down.

1094
01:01:40,550 --> 01:01:43,429
Speaker 1: Yes, relative to other fan cultures of similar things.

1095
01:01:49,583 --> 01:01:51,720
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.

1096
01:01:51,920 --> 01:01:56,860
Speaker 1: Special thanks to DJ Pretzel for the opening music, Kat Lee for web design, and Brando K for the logos.

1097

1098
01:02:02,522 --> 01:02:05,200
Speaker 1: Remember, Geek Nights is not one, but four different shows.

1099
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:09,899
Speaker 1: Sci-Tech Mondays, Gaming Tuesdays, Anime Comic Wednesdays, and Indiscriminate Thursdays.
