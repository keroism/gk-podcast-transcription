1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:11,546
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday April 15th.

2
00:00:12,108 --> 00:00:12,589
Speaker 0: I'm red.

3
00:00:12,730 --> 00:00:14,897
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,157 --> 00:00:19,280
Speaker 0: We talk about Aerobiz Yoshi's cookie and gem fire.

5
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,944
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,917 --> 00:00:35,153
Speaker 0: I was playing some of that Wesnoth on the train today that there was not a lot.

7
00:00:35,194 --> 00:00:36,258
Speaker 0: there wasn't all that.

8
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,486
Speaker 1: yeah We talked about the game a long time ago.

9
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:42,839
Speaker 1: It's I think it's still the best open-source game ever ever.

10
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,666
Speaker 1: It's pretty still a good game.

11
00:00:45,846 --> 00:00:46,810
Speaker 1: since we talked about it.

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,800
Speaker 1: actually they've made a lot of changes to it for the better.

13
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:53,300
Speaker 0: I like how the skeletons will juggle their own heads if they're bored.

14
00:00:53,380 --> 00:00:53,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, they added.

15
00:00:54,025 --> 00:01:02,050
Speaker 1: you know they added graphical changes You know little animations to all the sprites, but they've also made a lot of game changes And I think it's definitely you know.

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,918
Speaker 1: if it was good before it's pretty good now now.

17
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,859
Speaker 0: We had an official front row crew server for Wesnoth that was being managed by Alex.

18
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:20,112
Speaker 0: it It was used a lot like a crazy lot for a couple weeks way back in the day And then it kind of fell into disrepair, but it's back in a big way, so yep We've talked about the show before.

19
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:23,887
Speaker 0: go find the old episode But you've never heard of battle for Wesnoth.

20
00:01:24,349 --> 00:01:29,579
Speaker 0: Wesnoth like WES as in Wes and then noth as in a noth n-o-t-h.

21
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:34,793
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean you know you can always tell a good game because some games.

22
00:01:34,813 --> 00:01:37,863
Speaker 1: You'll play you'll finish you put them down They're gone forever.

23
00:01:38,063 --> 00:01:53,460
Speaker 1: You know some games like you pick them up, and you've been on five minutes and some games They just sort of they might not you know might put them down But you'll go back to them again later at some point in the future Maybe a month or two you know and you keep coming back repeatedly.

24
00:01:53,541 --> 00:01:55,677
Speaker 1: You don't stick with them for a long time at any you know.

25
00:01:56,141 --> 00:01:58,940
Speaker 1: But you'll play it not play play it not play it.

26
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,980
Speaker 1: I think though that shells you at a game is got some quality going on and Wesnoth is that kind of game.

27
00:02:04,663 --> 00:02:06,650
Speaker 0: Check it out download it and remember.

28
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:07,835
Speaker 0: There's an FRC server.

29
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:09,160
Speaker 0: You can play as each other.

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,306
Speaker 1: It's not that for a critic.

31
00:02:10,326 --> 00:02:11,371
Speaker 0: I have something like that.

32
00:02:11,532 --> 00:02:12,960
Speaker 1: just point your Wesnoth game.

33
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,832
Speaker 1: Go to multiplayer say join server type.

34
00:02:15,873 --> 00:02:16,857
Speaker 1: was not that for a credit?

35
00:02:16,877 --> 00:02:17,580
Speaker 1: accomplish enter.

36
00:02:17,921 --> 00:02:19,889
Speaker 0: Maybe I'll post in the forum, and I'm there.

37
00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:20,732
Speaker 0: I'll warn you though.

38
00:02:20,812 --> 00:02:23,543
Speaker 0: some of the people in the forums are pretty good Not me.

39
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,275
Speaker 0: oh yeah, Scott and I not so good.

40
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:39,800
Speaker 1: Oh you suck of course I I've actually what I won one game And I semi won another game just because what ends up happening is is two good players You know and then maybe a bad player, and then me right who's sort of not?

41
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,934
Speaker 1: I'm not terrible, but I'm not good right.

42
00:02:42,478 --> 00:02:59,626
Speaker 1: so They the good players end up fighting each other, and I just sort of like turtle up and slowly Slowly build up my resources and just sort of hold fast And then eventually when one of them decimates the other I swoop in like a vulture and then somehow I sort of Technically win.

43
00:02:59,868 --> 00:03:06,706
Speaker 0: one way to do that is to be the undead right and You build a couple of strong defensive units And then you build a bajillion zombies.

44
00:03:06,987 --> 00:03:13,620
Speaker 0: you build a few bats to keep flying around like grab the city run away grab a city Run away, but you make sure you have a positive income.

45
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:21,799
Speaker 0: And then every round you build as many zombies as you can Make a sea of them and then when you figure it's time to slowly start marching

46
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:25,413
Speaker 1: them I would just have a line of zombies the way you do a line of mechs in

47
00:03:25,854 --> 00:03:27,239
Speaker 0: or a lot of fanatics and sieve -

48
00:03:27,581 --> 00:03:28,507
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah,

49
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:30,440
Speaker 0: but I'd like to talk about another game real quick.

50
00:03:30,523 --> 00:03:37,329
Speaker 0: I'd like to Give this game the old nail through the heart because I think it's over for most of you at least But a lot of you were playing.

51
00:03:37,369 --> 00:03:37,952
Speaker 0: I carry him.

52
00:03:38,194 --> 00:03:39,200
Speaker 1: Oh you want to bring that up.

53
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:48,260
Speaker 0: I want to bring that up because this this happens more often than you'd expect in the front row crew where Everyone will get it like hey check this game out Scott.

54
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:55,613
Speaker 0: I'll say I'll play it and people start to play it, but rib always says hey I don't know about that game always says that game's not gonna be.

55
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:57,279
Speaker 0: you won't be playing that game after a week.

56
00:03:58,082 --> 00:04:04,500
Speaker 0: I didn't say I was gonna be playing the game, but there were other times where that was the case like mech warrior mage night.

57
00:04:04,866 --> 00:04:05,679
Speaker 1: That's one case.

58
00:04:06,963 --> 00:04:09,690
Speaker 0: I carry him name another one anyway.

59
00:04:09,711 --> 00:04:10,713
Speaker 1: That's it isn't it?

60
00:04:10,773 --> 00:04:11,696
Speaker 0: you only got two.

61
00:04:12,097 --> 00:04:12,819
Speaker 0: It's more than one.

62
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:14,385
Speaker 1: You're like Oh, it's a big trend.

63
00:04:14,425 --> 00:04:14,586
Speaker 1: No.

64
00:04:14,626 --> 00:04:16,253
Speaker 0: It's - that's just with Scott.

65
00:04:16,314 --> 00:04:21,940
Speaker 0: if we do the whole I mean if we talk about all the games and other people we but they're all still playing World of Warcraft.

66
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,530
Speaker 0: I was about to bring up World of Warcraft.

67
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:27,279
Speaker 1: They're still playing it even though It's no different than I care, but I carry him.

68
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,360
Speaker 0: I mean it was like oh this game's cool.

69
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,868
Speaker 0: I was like all right, and I made an account.

70
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:32,596
Speaker 0: I logged in and I was looking.

71
00:04:32,616 --> 00:04:36,099
Speaker 0: I was thinking all right If this game's good Then there's gonna be some strategy.

72
00:04:36,662 --> 00:04:43,338
Speaker 0: so I looked in the forums and I tried to read a little bit about what strategies there were and I discovered that it didn't matter what you did ever.

73
00:04:44,381 --> 00:04:45,204
Speaker 1: Yeah, pretty much.

74
00:04:45,224 --> 00:04:48,800
Speaker 1: I mean you know it started out where the game was kind of interesting in that.

75
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:50,428
Speaker 1: Oh, it's like a web game.

76
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:53,000
Speaker 1: You know I don't have to sit there for hours and hours playing it.

77
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:58,820
Speaker 1: I just visit the website occasionally And then I click on a few things and then I can leave and then come back a little bit later.

78
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,427
Speaker 1: You know basically log in spend all my resources log out come back like that night Maybe twice a day.

79
00:05:05,628 --> 00:05:06,614
Speaker 0: see I didn't even think of it.

80
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:08,330
Speaker 0: from the game perspective I thought all right.

81
00:05:08,897 --> 00:05:18,099
Speaker 0: either this is a trick to get the sunk cost fallacy and use it to make money off of people or It's a legitimate person trying to make something cool.

82
00:05:18,623 --> 00:05:29,448
Speaker 0: So what I did is I read the terms of service And I determined immediately that this game was designed solely to hook you in and once you get to the point where You'd feel bad about abandoning everything.

83
00:05:29,468 --> 00:05:37,320
Speaker 0: You've built is about the point where it really sucks to keep playing Unless you pay for some little conveniences.

84
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:41,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, I pretty well in terms of service a complete bullshit in terms.

85
00:05:42,322 --> 00:05:44,574
Speaker 0: I don't want to get into how awful they are.

86
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:48,089
Speaker 1: yeah after a day or two I sort of realized that the game was pretty much just.

87
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:52,882
Speaker 1: you know click wait for things to level up Wait for things to level up And there was no.

88
00:05:53,223 --> 00:05:55,310
Speaker 1: the main problem with the game is there's no losing.

89
00:05:55,330 --> 00:06:00,830
Speaker 1: so if like if there's no way to lose you just Slowly approach, and there's no winning either.

90
00:06:00,850 --> 00:06:01,031
Speaker 1: It's like.

91
00:06:01,051 --> 00:06:02,075
Speaker 1: How do you win?

92
00:06:02,517 --> 00:06:03,300
Speaker 1: There is no winning?

93
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,082
Speaker 0: It's like.

94
00:06:04,163 --> 00:06:05,006
Speaker 0: I think we've learned.

95
00:06:05,046 --> 00:06:08,640
Speaker 0: there's a very famous movie that taught us very well very much.

96
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,868
Speaker 0: So how to win at games like I carry him.

97
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:14,380
Speaker 0: the only winning move is not to play.

98
00:06:14,544 --> 00:06:18,790
Speaker 0: Yeah That's the second time in a week.

99
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:20,177
Speaker 0: I've quoted that movie.

100
00:06:20,298 --> 00:06:28,360
Speaker 1: Yeah But anyway, yeah that game that game I discovered it was dumb and like a few days and then I stopped playing it a few days after that.

101
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,469
Speaker 0: But I like how you can kind of see the trend of like.

102
00:06:30,811 --> 00:06:38,680
Speaker 0: you know the classic graph of Innovators early adopters the mainstream the trailing edge, and you saw it in the crew and in the forums.

103
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:48,000
Speaker 0: It was like oh, we're gonna play this game And then all the cool people in the forums and everyone in the forums But then all the people who started playing it quit, and then there's this kind of trailing off.

104
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,053
Speaker 0: There's a few people are sticking with it to the end.

105
00:06:50,073 --> 00:06:53,716
Speaker 1: Yeah There's the same people playing World of Warcraft.

106
00:06:53,756 --> 00:06:56,184
Speaker 1: I think That's the main problem.

107
00:06:56,204 --> 00:06:56,626
Speaker 1: Is that like?

108
00:06:56,927 --> 00:06:59,960
Speaker 1: what kind of game doesn't have an end like that?

109
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,920
Speaker 1: I mean if it's if it's a role playing see it depends.

110
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:12,030
Speaker 0: I would like a game that didn't have an end like like Civ - I would usually keep playing Well after the game said hey, you're done.

111
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:12,632
Speaker 0: Here's you.

112
00:07:12,652 --> 00:07:15,240
Speaker 1: yeah, but you had a goal like if you took over the world.

113
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:20,098
Speaker 0: Actually, I was usually really pissed if I took over the world because that that there was nothing left to do.

114
00:07:20,218 --> 00:07:21,299
Speaker 1: exactly There's an end.

115
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:27,686
Speaker 1: This is there's a point at which even if you you know if this it's not a you know like even if the game doesn't Pop up and say game over.

116
00:07:27,967 --> 00:07:29,815
Speaker 1: It's like there is nothing more for me.

117
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:30,658
Speaker 0: It's like Sim City.

118
00:07:30,779 --> 00:07:34,351
Speaker 0: alright I have filled the last square with the best arcology.

119
00:07:34,652 --> 00:07:34,933
Speaker 1: Yes.

120
00:07:34,993 --> 00:07:36,940
Speaker 1: I have the entire board filled with arcologies.

121
00:07:37,221 --> 00:07:40,591
Speaker 1: There's electricity and water everywhere and everything is perfect.

122
00:07:41,052 --> 00:07:43,600
Speaker 1: What could I possibly do now and at that point?

123
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:45,750
Speaker 0: It's not even fun to make the disasters happen.

124
00:07:45,790 --> 00:07:47,519
Speaker 0: you see the arcologies fall down.

125
00:07:48,842 --> 00:07:50,834
Speaker 1: Yeah, they don't even sort of fall down in a cool way.

126
00:07:50,854 --> 00:07:51,820
Speaker 1: They just sort of go boom.

127
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:57,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's one thing that the Sim City games always lacked was the ability to zoom in on individual citizens panicking.

128
00:07:57,701 --> 00:08:02,345
Speaker 1: I think the newer Sim cities that we never played have that cuz 2000s last only play.

129
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:02,787
Speaker 0: yeah, cuz.

130
00:08:02,807 --> 00:08:05,940
Speaker 0: I think that was the best one in terms of a simulation game of a city.

131
00:08:06,102 --> 00:08:12,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway Plus I've heard the newest Sim City is like the crappest crap that ever crapped.

132
00:08:13,601 --> 00:08:14,323
Speaker 1: I've no idea.

133
00:08:14,343 --> 00:08:17,734
Speaker 1: I've heard it try out the civilization revolutions for the DS.

134
00:08:17,754 --> 00:08:18,577
Speaker 1: That's what I'm gonna try.

135
00:08:18,617 --> 00:08:19,580
Speaker 0: I'm excited about that.

136
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:20,103
Speaker 0: I'll admit it.

137
00:08:20,485 --> 00:08:26,540
Speaker 1: We'll see alright, so yeah, I'm not I'm not confident It could suck, but I wouldn't be disappointed if it sucked because I have a low expectation.

138
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,219
Speaker 0: I think it has a better chance of not sucking than Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, which I guess in my heart.

139
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:37,280
Speaker 0: I Expected the the DS game to be awful like I knew in my heart.

140
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:49,260
Speaker 0: It's kind of like I want to believe in cool things But at the same time I have logic and the logic says no no and I believed okay This game's gonna be awesome, but my heart knew and I lied to myself.

141
00:08:49,582 --> 00:08:51,940
Speaker 0: I knew that game was gonna suck and I spent money on it.

142
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,567
Speaker 0: I got it, and I played it and I went.

143
00:08:53,848 --> 00:08:56,640
Speaker 0: ah I was right except that I lied to myself.

144
00:08:57,202 --> 00:09:03,324
Speaker 0: So I was wrong, but I was right in the end, but I have 40 less dollars Mmm.

145
00:09:03,344 --> 00:09:03,645
Speaker 0: I don't know.

146
00:09:03,665 --> 00:09:04,811
Speaker 0: that's all I had to say about that.

147
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:06,780
Speaker 0: I got a non video game news.

148
00:09:06,861 --> 00:09:07,889
Speaker 0: It's related my video.

149
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,100
Speaker 1: my news is also non video.

150
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:15,380
Speaker 0: It's related tangentially in that we talked about this a lot on Monday, and we talked about it a lot on Thursday.

151
00:09:16,182 --> 00:09:17,820
Speaker 0: Don't talk about it so much on Tuesday.

152
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:27,599
Speaker 0: but a lot of you gamers out there with your Xbox and and your PlayStation threes have the HDTVs and you need cable to hook up the HDTVs to your boxes.

153
00:09:28,643 --> 00:09:30,108
Speaker 1: You just use an HDMI cable.

154
00:09:30,349 --> 00:09:31,072
Speaker 1: the end of story.

155
00:09:31,353 --> 00:09:33,059
Speaker 0: monster cables are crap.

156
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:41,495
Speaker 1: well Just in case you didn't know that an HDMI cable is a digital cable That means you either have a cable that works or a cable that doesn't work.

157
00:09:41,776 --> 00:09:46,411
Speaker 1: if the cable works It's just as good as every other cable that works.

158
00:09:46,813 --> 00:09:50,204
Speaker 1: if you can get an HDMI cable for a dollar That is long enough.

159
00:09:50,244 --> 00:09:51,568
Speaker 1: I guess the length is different.

160
00:09:51,608 --> 00:09:58,780
Speaker 1: right and it works, and then someone else has an HDMI cable That's $500 is the same length and also works.

161
00:09:59,261 --> 00:10:01,968
Speaker 1: There is no difference in performance between the two cables.

162
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:03,512
Speaker 1: none zero.

163
00:10:03,832 --> 00:10:12,803
Speaker 0: even further if you have analog cables Monster cables are not better than pretty much code hangers nothing You.

164
00:10:13,044 --> 00:10:18,735
Speaker 0: there is no human perceptible difference and in fact a lot of people I've seen say that they're actually worse because they made kind of shot elite.

165
00:10:19,077 --> 00:10:25,639
Speaker 0: alright, but monster has a habit of selling cables to people who are uninformed or stupid.

166
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:36,529
Speaker 0: yep and pursuant to this they also have a policy of finding anyone who might compete with them in any way and Throwing vague legal threats at them until they go away.

167
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:43,468
Speaker 1: Yeah, they've battled quite a few quite a history of you know threatening people with lawsuits and then sort of settling.

168
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:48,350
Speaker 0: well It just so happens that they tried to sue someone someone over at Blue Jeans cable.

169
00:10:48,671 --> 00:10:49,494
Speaker 0: They sent one of those.

170
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:52,747
Speaker 0: you're violating our patents and our blue jeans cable.

171
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,875
Speaker 1: sell bullshit cables Also, or a real cable.

172
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:57,785
Speaker 0: I didn't even look, but I respect for this guy regardless.

173
00:10:57,805 --> 00:10:59,070
Speaker 0: the guy runs blue jean cable.

174
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,370
Speaker 0: I'm gonna look for blue jean cables because the deal is they sent him this record violating our patents our copyrights.

175
00:11:04,511 --> 00:11:06,080
Speaker 0: We're going to serve you for everything.

176
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,166
Speaker 0: you should shut down me.

177
00:11:07,327 --> 00:11:09,176
Speaker 0: Let's see I don't know what kind of voice that was.

178
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:09,679
Speaker 0: I was doing.

179
00:11:09,719 --> 00:11:11,849
Speaker 0: I guess that's what monster cable sounds like to me.

180
00:11:12,431 --> 00:11:18,030
Speaker 0: But he responded with a letter that you should read in its entirety.

181
00:11:18,532 --> 00:11:45,270
Speaker 0: You know you're watching someone who has never played a video game in their life trying to play like I don't know Soulcalibur against the person who won the most recent Soulcalibur tournament or Watching someone who doesn't understand how to add one-on-one Debating a mathematician like seeing someone owned so thoroughly and so utterly to see such a one-sided engagement Much like what would happen if you were really good at one most fall 2097 in the news report afterward.

182
00:11:45,531 --> 00:11:46,433
Speaker 1: Yeah, oh, you know.

183
00:11:46,835 --> 00:11:48,179
Speaker 1: I'm going at my blue jeans.

184
00:11:48,219 --> 00:11:50,907
Speaker 1: cable is cables are reasonably priced.

185
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:57,150
Speaker 0: Oh Huh what I never would have expected that considering that this guy seems smart and rational and cool.

186
00:11:58,191 --> 00:12:06,350
Speaker 0: Anyway, so he responded with a very long letter Explaining one that needs to be a lawyer a good lawyer for a long time now.

187
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,010
Speaker 0: He makes cables because there's a lot of money in cables.

188
00:12:09,191 --> 00:12:13,169
Speaker 1: I guess there is but and kind of a weird switch like lawyering cabling.

189
00:12:13,912 --> 00:12:14,253
Speaker 0: I don't know.

190
00:12:14,293 --> 00:12:17,585
Speaker 0: There's a stock guy at my work who also is a chef.

191
00:12:18,188 --> 00:12:21,257
Speaker 0: That's okay But lawyer cable isn't.

192
00:12:21,718 --> 00:12:33,030
Speaker 0: no why not anyway, so this letter is so Wonderful to read as it bit by bit you ever see a buck a forum post.

193
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:43,687
Speaker 0: That's so bad and so misinformed that you want to just like take it Sentenced by sentence and attack each sentence on its own and just destroy it as much as you can.

194
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:47,250
Speaker 0: this lawyer does this and It's a beautiful thing to behold.

195
00:12:48,331 --> 00:12:53,489
Speaker 0: I'm gonna follow this to its bitter horrible end because monster cable isn't.

196
00:12:53,890 --> 00:12:54,514
Speaker 0: They're screwed.

197
00:12:54,816 --> 00:13:07,454
Speaker 0: if they ignore this and they give up on this guy The internet will know and people will start to realize hopefully that their cables are not what they say They are and if they actually go forward with trying to sue this guy They're fucked.

198
00:13:07,755 --> 00:13:12,269
Speaker 1: the thing is if you read the actual thing the guy wrote I read almost the whole thing.

199
00:13:13,315 --> 00:13:18,038
Speaker 1: He didn't actually attack, you know Monster for any sort of false advertising.

200
00:13:18,059 --> 00:13:20,146
Speaker 0: Yeah, he bet he implied it heavily though.

201
00:13:20,366 --> 00:13:26,000
Speaker 0: He basically said Regardless of the many many many many many points.

202
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:35,808
Speaker 0: I have made above know that if you pursue action against me I will bring up many many many many many as yet unstated and obvious defenses.

203
00:13:36,411 --> 00:13:43,170
Speaker 1: Haha, yeah, but most of the thing he actually wrote was talking about how your patents are untenable.

204
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:50,049
Speaker 1: and wow, you're basically saying that I'm infringing upon you because I made an RCA cable.

205
00:13:50,189 --> 00:13:55,490
Speaker 1: and You know all the things that you're basically patenting are common to all RCA.

206
00:13:55,550 --> 00:14:01,150
Speaker 0: Okay, I like particularly where he points out that they said he violated multiple different trademarks.

207
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:05,130
Speaker 0: But each of those trademarks was so different from the other traits.

208
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:11,690
Speaker 1: Like if I made knives and you made knives and I sued you because your knife was sharpened on one side even like that.

209
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:15,330
Speaker 0: It's like if I said I'm suing you because you violate these five trademarks.

210
00:14:15,752 --> 00:14:19,950
Speaker 0: I have a trademark on a knife with a red handle on a knife with a blue handle and a knife with a green handle.

211
00:14:20,171 --> 00:14:23,949
Speaker 0: Yeah, and my and it's like I cannot have infringed upon all of those.

212
00:14:26,292 --> 00:14:27,569
Speaker 0: It's it's wonderful to behold.

213
00:14:28,053 --> 00:14:33,219
Speaker 1: anyway, this guy will sell you a Ten foot XLR cable for thirty three fifty.

214
00:14:33,259 --> 00:14:33,680
Speaker 1: Is that good?

215
00:14:34,021 --> 00:14:34,583
Speaker 0: That's okay.

216
00:14:34,643 --> 00:14:35,205
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

217
00:14:35,225 --> 00:14:36,830
Speaker 0: Yeah, if it's quality, that's great.

218
00:14:36,992 --> 00:14:39,448
Speaker 1: It seems like it's pretty quality balanced.

219
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:45,097
Speaker 0: Well, of course it is All right, that's all I got.

220
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,990
Speaker 0: I just wanted to point out I guess I haven't brought it up on Wednesday.

221
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:49,055
Speaker 0: I'm sure I will at some point.

222
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:52,070
Speaker 0: don't buy fancy digital cables.

223
00:14:52,371 --> 00:14:54,175
Speaker 0: They're all the same.

224
00:14:54,196 --> 00:14:56,161
Speaker 1: don't buy the cheapest cables.

225
00:14:56,181 --> 00:14:59,530
Speaker 1: You can possibly find for everything no matter what.

226
00:15:00,273 --> 00:15:03,990
Speaker 1: Can you think of any instance where you'd want want to pay more for digital cables?

227
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:05,882
Speaker 1: I don't know even for analog cables.

228
00:15:05,922 --> 00:15:06,750
Speaker 1: You can buy the cheap ones.

229
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:07,532
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter.

230
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:12,007
Speaker 0: if you're running say a long audio run right in an electronically noisy room.

231
00:15:12,027 --> 00:15:13,070
Speaker 0: You gotta get shielded cables.

232
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:13,934
Speaker 0: It's very expensive.

233
00:15:14,195 --> 00:15:14,476
Speaker 1: Yeah.

234
00:15:14,757 --> 00:15:18,854
Speaker 1: Oh, I guess if you're also doing like some sort of live musical thing You might want better cable.

235
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:28,519
Speaker 0: Yes, or if they're gonna be in a public place being stepped on or anything like that Yeah, then you need sturdier cables, but for your little home entertainment center Just buy cheap cable.

236
00:15:28,559 --> 00:15:32,450
Speaker 0: and if you think you can tell the difference well It's it you can't anyway.

237
00:15:32,571 --> 00:15:33,093
Speaker 0: That's all I got.

238
00:15:33,113 --> 00:15:44,679
Speaker 1: you should read the article then that talks about how the people thought that the same wine With the more expensive price label on it tasted better than the same wine with I think the the pen and teller with a bullshit Show where they did the water.

239
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,444
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was all hose water But they said all this water is $50 fancy.

240
00:15:49,190 --> 00:15:53,710
Speaker 0: Well that coat hanger study where they show that people couldn't tell the difference between a coat hanger and a monster cable.

241
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:58,430
Speaker 1: All right, so do you remember the last time we're at uber con like three something years ago?

242
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,127
Speaker 1: It was a while ago.

243
00:15:59,391 --> 00:16:06,430
Speaker 0: That was the time where we interviewed Luke Crane But I got super drunk and then we lost the power cable to the compressor and I drove home in a blizzard.

244
00:16:06,671 --> 00:16:07,654
Speaker 1: Yep, that one.

245
00:16:07,834 --> 00:16:09,078
Speaker 0: that was an awesome time.

246
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,546
Speaker 1: Do you do you already know my news is now?

250
00:16:20,370 --> 00:16:29,570

251
00:16:29,832 --> 00:16:30,295
Speaker 0: It's funny.

252
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:38,150
Speaker 0: He's he's a rock star Game-master and I say that a lot and Scott says it a lot, but he had like an entourage following him.

253
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,039
Speaker 1: Well, no, it was pretty much him in tour.

254
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:42,854
Speaker 1: Those other people were from our chaos studio Press.

Speaker 0: You'd see like one guy walking and then this crowd like would be up and follow.

259
00:16:55,912 --> 00:16:57,498
Speaker 1: Uh, it wasn't really an entourage.

260
00:16:57,558 --> 00:17:03,805
Speaker 1: It was he was talking to some people who were unrelated to him You know doing business dealings and yeah, just making chitchat.

00:17:03,825 --> 00:17:04,790
Speaker 1: It wasn't an entourage.

262
00:17:05,231 --> 00:17:07,459

Speaker 1: Luke crane is based on a simplified burning wheel.

289
00:18:32,174 --> 00:18:41,850
Speaker 1: I'm just I'm paraphrasing now Includes art and extensive background material on the mouse territory is specially prepared by David Peterson the Mouse Guard creator.

290
00:18:42,752 --> 00:18:48,927
Speaker 1: two hundred and forty page hardcover thirty dollars That's it.

291
00:18:49,412 --> 00:18:52,546
Speaker 0: All right Guaranteed buying.

292
00:18:52,687 --> 00:18:54,478
Speaker 0: this is definitely going to be a good game.

293
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:57,428
Speaker 1: Duh, can you imagine though think about this?

294
00:18:58,191 --> 00:19:04,009
Speaker 1: It's such a perfect role-playing game because it's like, okay We're mice's right you got the inter mice in.

295
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,336
Speaker 0: I believe the technical term is Mises Mises.

296
00:19:06,758 --> 00:19:07,500
Speaker 1: you go outside.

297
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,566
Speaker 1: You know me sport.

298
00:19:08,727 --> 00:19:13,239
Speaker 1: Okay, you crawl around on the ground An owl shows up.

299
00:19:14,401 --> 00:19:19,480
Speaker 1: You don't worry about like monsters and stuff, you know, you don't have the unrealistic bullshit of random encounters.

300
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:22,470
Speaker 1: I think you have the totally make sense random encounters.

301
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,377
Speaker 1: Of course is gonna be animals in the woods.

302
00:19:24,417 --> 00:19:31,738
Speaker 0: I think what works More to the game's credit is that the setting of Mouse Guard is very neat.

303
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:36,147
Speaker 0: that too I mean, I don't want to say cool It's really neat and I like it.

304
00:19:36,227 --> 00:19:42,519
Speaker 0: and it fits kind of with the burning wheel like the base burning wheel Setting that you're expected to kind of use.

305
00:19:43,881 --> 00:19:49,960
Speaker 1: Also, the the book is gonna be eight by eight, you know, like a little square book the same as the Mouse Guard books themselves.

306
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:56,835
Speaker 1: So you can put it right up there next to your other Mouse Guard hardcovers Right in between your burning wheel books and your Mouse Guard books.

307
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:57,639
Speaker 1: It'll go right in there.

308
00:19:58,701 --> 00:20:00,366
Speaker 1: So yeah guaranteed buying in August.

309
00:20:00,426 --> 00:20:02,451
Speaker 1: I'll remind you again in August.

310
00:20:02,792 --> 00:20:04,116
Speaker 1: Maybe we'll ask the crane about it.

311
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:07,025
Speaker 0: Maybe maybe Have you gotten a lot of key.

312
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:14,332
Speaker 0: if you have any questions for Luke crane keep posting them in the forum because we're gonna do An interview whenever we have time we could just be to just have.

313
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:18,217
Speaker 1: we just make the Luke crane burning wheel Podcast just talk to him like once a month.

314
00:20:19,761 --> 00:20:21,408
Speaker 0: That's not that bad of an idea actually.

315
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:25,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, like like, you know, 15 minutes of Luke crane every month That's not bad at all.

316
00:20:25,831 --> 00:20:26,858

317
00:20:27,688 --> 00:20:27,939
Speaker 0: anyway.

318
00:20:35,181 --> 00:20:37,250
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

319
00:20:37,270 --> 00:20:53,413
Speaker 0: on July 31st Something was released into the world something frightening something that perhaps a video game a video game from a day 1995. video games were very different from how they are now.

320
00:20:53,433 --> 00:20:55,340
Speaker 1: It was pre internets, right?

321
00:20:55,801 --> 00:20:58,290
Speaker 0: So and in 95 wasn't really pre internet.

322
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,820
Speaker 1: I mean it could have been I had a cable modem.

323
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:15,655
Speaker 1: It was either a very early PlayStation game or a late SNES game or maybe a Sega Saturn Game, it was definitely a PC game Must have been an earlier sort of mid CD-ROM game.

324
00:21:15,796 --> 00:21:16,940
Speaker 0: about that.

325
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:24,030
Speaker 0: in fact was the era might have been like met warrior 2 of the Multi media game now.

326
00:21:24,352 --> 00:21:30,172
Speaker 0: This was not the first kind of Multimedia era game or the digitized games.

327
00:21:30,192 --> 00:21:33,081
Speaker 1: a lot of them did indeed come out 95.

328
00:21:33,081 --> 00:21:33,603
Speaker 1: I'm no fool.

329
00:21:34,044 --> 00:21:41,200
Speaker 0: It was probably I would say I mean people are gonna quibble him say no Technically, this was the first digitized game and blah blah blah blah blah.

330
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,506
Speaker 0: And there was that game on the SNES.

331
00:21:42,526 --> 00:21:45,639
Speaker 0: so there were two games like that on the SNES but on the PC.

332
00:21:46,522 --> 00:21:53,252
Speaker 0: Under a Killing Moon was the first Multimedia with real actors game that people and or directive.

333
00:21:53,613 --> 00:21:53,975
Speaker 0: No.

334
00:21:54,175 --> 00:21:55,500
Speaker 0: No, that was the sequel.

335
00:21:55,762 --> 00:21:56,912
Speaker 1: I know that's what I'm talking about.

336
00:21:56,953 --> 00:21:57,699
Speaker 0: game was awful.

337
00:21:57,969 --> 00:22:02,919
Speaker 0: Yeah Under a Killing Moon was at least okay because it had James Earl Jones in it and Margo Kidder.

338
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,948
Speaker 1: Didn't the other one also have James?

339
00:22:05,008 --> 00:22:05,430
Speaker 0: I don't know.

340
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:06,293
Speaker 0: I never even played it.

341
00:22:06,314 --> 00:22:07,800
Speaker 0: I'm just like the demo.

342
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:09,686
Speaker 0: I'm just casting aspersions all about.

343
00:22:09,726 --> 00:22:10,970
Speaker 0: I think I assume it sucks.

344
00:22:11,411 --> 00:22:12,835
Speaker 1: Yeah, who knows if it sucked there.

345
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,440
Speaker 1: I played the demo anyway.

346
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:15,287
Speaker 0: Thanks Murphy.

347
00:22:15,468 --> 00:22:20,426
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah in 95 Phantasmagoria was released.

348
00:22:20,486 --> 00:22:22,453
Speaker 0: you do not remember phantasmagoria.

349
00:22:22,814 --> 00:22:31,204
Speaker 0: This game was Awful, but at the same time it was touted as a revolutionary Genre.

350
00:22:31,285 --> 00:22:34,880
Speaker 0: changing like the world of gaming will never be the same.

351
00:22:34,940 --> 00:22:37,755
Speaker 0: This game was hyped up like you wouldn't freakin believe.

352
00:22:37,855 --> 00:22:38,760
Speaker 1: it was super hyped up.

353
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,505
Speaker 0: This was an adult game.

354
00:22:40,565 --> 00:22:46,280
Speaker 0: this not not adult in the porn way but adult in for mature audience and not in the mature porn way.

355
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:47,564
Speaker 0: But how come?

356
00:22:47,644 --> 00:22:51,416
Speaker 0: every way we have of saying something is for a mature audience implies pornography.

357
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:52,500
Speaker 1: I don't know.

358
00:22:52,741 --> 00:22:58,884
Speaker 0: I mean if you go to any convention video games, whatever and they say yeah, that's the mature gaming room You know, it's porn games.

359
00:22:59,406 --> 00:23:02,295
Speaker 0: if they say that's the adult showing room, you know, it's porn.

360
00:23:02,556 --> 00:23:06,598
Speaker 0: It's never anything but porn yeah, but uh this game.

361
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:10,327
Speaker 0: I Played this game all the way through.

362
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:13,920
Speaker 0: so did my mom and my little brother.

363
00:23:14,281 --> 00:23:18,133
Speaker 0: My dad took one look at it and said why do you want to watch a video?

364
00:23:18,193 --> 00:23:20,419
Speaker 0: That's two inches by three inches and blurry.

365
00:23:22,984 --> 00:23:23,749

Speaker 0: But look now I get to click on stuff.

372
00:23:36,082 --> 00:23:39,134
Speaker 0: Oh, so that little cursor changes when you're over something to click on.

373
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:40,299
Speaker 0: Yeah, so what do you do?

374
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,104
Speaker 0: Click out all the things.

375
00:23:42,687 --> 00:23:46,322
Speaker 1: Oh, that's a great game a lot like that Monty Python game I play.

376
00:23:46,884 --> 00:23:47,708
Speaker 0: I had that game.

377
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,174
Speaker 0: I had two of those games.

378
00:23:49,757 --> 00:23:50,279
Speaker 1: I laid one.

379
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:53,515
Speaker 0: Fantasmagoria was amazing.

380
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:57,468
Speaker 0: No amazingly bad in that one is.

381
00:23:58,412 --> 00:24:03,327
Speaker 0: I forgot until recently how Frighteningly violent this game is.

382
00:24:03,729 --> 00:24:07,945
Speaker 0: this game is just a series of poorly Snuff film.

383
00:24:08,145 --> 00:24:11,597
Speaker 0: it's silly violent, but it really while it's silly.

384
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:15,328
Speaker 0: It's also Super bloody and super violent.

385
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:20,283
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like bright red blood with the zipper hanging out, you know, it's not like The killer.

386
00:24:20,363 --> 00:24:26,621
Speaker 0: Yeah, it depends though because there's the one scene where he breaks the woman's neck and it's actually just really disturbing and not even Funny.

387
00:24:26,641 --> 00:24:29,913
Speaker 0: yeah, but the story whatever.

388
00:24:30,535 --> 00:24:39,169
Speaker 0: one thing this game had I want to point out Is that the end sequence was actually kind of cool, you know in a lot of games now There's like there'll be an FMV but oh shit press a.

389
00:24:39,189 --> 00:24:44,965
Speaker 1: oh Yeah, the the the much hated by Zero punctuation.

390
00:24:45,065 --> 00:24:47,513
Speaker 0: this game had that before.

391
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,319
Speaker 0: all those other games had that.

392
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:55,711
Speaker 1: well I might not who knows if it was the first game to have that but surly Certainly this game had it before.

393
00:24:55,731 --> 00:24:56,756
Speaker 1: it was a huge trend.

394
00:24:56,776 --> 00:25:01,636
Speaker 0: the cool thing It didn't have the whole game which was on seven CDs.

395
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:04,928
Speaker 1: I point out It still doesn't beat Wing Commander.

396
00:25:04,968 --> 00:25:05,832
Speaker 1: for how many was that?

397
00:25:06,233 --> 00:25:07,096
Speaker 0: This did not.

398
00:25:07,116 --> 00:25:07,699
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

399
00:25:08,664 --> 00:25:10,760
Speaker 0: You did not have that until the end of the game.

400
00:25:11,021 --> 00:25:17,088
Speaker 0: The end of the game was like this 10 minute 20 minute long FMV where you had to do that through the whole thing.

401
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:24,092
Speaker 0: and let me tell you there were like a billion violent ways to die Mmm, but what I have?

402
00:25:24,132 --> 00:25:26,826
Speaker 1: much in the style of Shadowgate.

403
00:25:27,411 --> 00:25:28,259
Speaker 0: ah Shadowgate.

404
00:25:29,763 --> 00:25:39,146
Speaker 0: What I have for you here my thing of the day are two examples of video from this game not three three examples because One is not safe for work.

405
00:25:39,207 --> 00:25:40,370
Speaker 0: It is one of the death scenes.

406
00:25:40,811 --> 00:25:42,175
Speaker 0: I point out the acting.

407
00:25:42,195 --> 00:25:44,040
Speaker 0: it is most excellent.

408
00:25:45,262 --> 00:25:49,011
Speaker 0: to especially note how the guy swaggers in it.

409
00:25:50,621 --> 00:25:51,724
Speaker 0: Words cannot express.

410
00:25:51,805 --> 00:25:56,199
Speaker 1: Wow phantasmagoria was seven CDs, but wing commander 4 was only six CDs.

411
00:25:58,883 --> 00:26:00,309
Speaker 1: So it actually beats it out by one.

412
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:06,775
Speaker 0: but the next video I have is the original Trailer that was used to hype this game up.

413
00:26:06,995 --> 00:26:09,123
Speaker 1: We're like e3 or something I don't even know.

414
00:26:09,243 --> 00:26:14,860
Speaker 0: all I know is that these the people making this game thought this game was serious business.

415
00:26:15,463 --> 00:26:18,780
Speaker 1: I'm sure they did cuz at the time, you know, you just look at it and go holy shit

416
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:26,376
Speaker 0: You know what at the time I did and so did my mom because we looked and like wow This game is really violent and video games were never like that before.

417
00:26:26,396 --> 00:26:28,765
Speaker 1: Wow It's really a video game.

418
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:29,427
Speaker 0: It was.

419
00:26:29,467 --> 00:26:30,290
Speaker 0: technically it was.

420
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:30,992
Speaker 0: there were puzzles.

421
00:26:31,394 --> 00:26:33,300
Speaker 1: Well, then technically YouTube's a video game.

422
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,264
Speaker 1: It's interactive right.

423
00:26:34,284 --> 00:26:35,328
Speaker 1: you click play and stop.

424
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:36,714
Speaker 0: there were actually puzzles.

425
00:26:36,734 --> 00:26:41,773
Speaker 0: the puzzles were like, all right I need blood to finish this horrible ritual at the end of the game.

426
00:26:42,115 --> 00:26:43,500
Speaker 0: Oh, look, I have a piece of glass.

427
00:26:43,741 --> 00:26:46,193
Speaker 0: I will cut my wrist with the glass to drop blood on the plate.

428
00:26:46,213 --> 00:26:47,058
Speaker 1: That's a wonderful game.

429
00:26:47,078 --> 00:26:51,178
Speaker 1: All right My thing of the day on my third video is the opening movie.

430
00:26:51,218 --> 00:26:51,580
Speaker 0: It's epic.

431
00:26:51,721 --> 00:26:56,240
Speaker 1: Anyway, my thing of the day you this has been on everywhere on the internet.

432
00:26:56,321 --> 00:26:57,580
Speaker 1: This is like all over the place.

433
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,820
Speaker 1: If you haven't seen this video by the time you're listening to this then you are not connected to the internet.

434
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:06,090
Speaker 1: You are not an internet person and you need to step it up.

435
00:27:07,014 --> 00:27:09,786
Speaker 0: if you have seen this video I had not seen the video.

436
00:27:10,408 --> 00:27:11,693
Speaker 0: No, right, of course.

437
00:27:11,814 --> 00:27:13,320
Speaker 0: I was at work working.

438
00:27:14,522 --> 00:27:19,220
Speaker 1: If you had been if you'd if we had like waited more 10 more minutes before starting the show you would have found the video.

439
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,528
Speaker 0: I think I can tell you a different measure.

440
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:23,074
Speaker 0: that's very close to what Scott was saying.

441
00:27:23,796 --> 00:27:34,020
Speaker 0: This video is not easily found near the top of dig yet as of the recording of this show and Thus one more note that dig is no longer.

442
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:41,520
Speaker 0: I mean dig got really crappy and it's almost useless now, but at least it had stuff that was internet II real early.

443
00:27:42,121 --> 00:27:43,184
Speaker 0: Now it doesn't even have that.

444
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,269
Speaker 0: it's like the signal-to-noise ratio is hit zero.

445
00:27:45,550 --> 00:27:45,770
Speaker 1: Yep.

446
00:27:46,252 --> 00:27:50,102
Speaker 1: Anyway, I guess this video has been everywhere on the internet I mean like.

447
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:54,680
Speaker 1: I saw it at like three different sites, you know, but it's still a good video.

448
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,254
Speaker 1: There's a reason it got so popular today and it's worth watching.

449
00:27:58,274 --> 00:28:01,720
Speaker 1: if you haven't seen it if you have seen it Well, then you're just gonna hear me talk about it.

450
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:20,005
Speaker 1: basically what they did is they took an RC car in a parking garage and They put some things on the hanging off the side of the RC car right like little dangly bits and they drove the RC car past a bunch of wine bottles with various amounts of liquid in them and with the dangly bits hit the Wine bottles.

451
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:21,779
Speaker 1: they would make a noise, you know.

452
00:28:22,301 --> 00:28:31,800
Speaker 1: And so they would line up and space the bottles out to create music and then drive the car Past all the bottles at a steady rate, you know to get the music to play.

453
00:28:33,201 --> 00:28:33,382
Speaker 0: Yeah,

454
00:28:33,743 --> 00:28:46,162
Speaker 1: and at the end of the song they actually put wine bottles on both sides of the car to sort of hit You know go faster than you normally could with the notes and they did the Mario song which is why it's a Tuesday thing of the day and Really?

455
00:28:46,242 --> 00:28:47,667
Speaker 1: They did a much better job.

456
00:28:47,687 --> 00:28:57,255
Speaker 1: that like I was thinking it'd be like, you know, dude, dude, dude But it's actually like wow, these must be Japanese people.

457
00:28:57,315 --> 00:29:03,813
Speaker 0: see the amount of anything You know, it could just be college kids at a tech school.

458
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,000
Speaker 1: No if you get to see I think it's Japanese.

459
00:29:06,101 --> 00:29:07,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, I haven't actually seen it yet.

460
00:29:08,031 --> 00:29:09,720
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure it's Japanese people.

461
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:15,218
Speaker 1: Anyway, it might be I can't really tell the videos sort of granny if we know it's not South Korean.

462
00:29:15,258 --> 00:29:20,094
Speaker 1: because no No, actually at the end the URL is exit excite China.

463
00:29:20,155 --> 00:29:21,700
Speaker 1: So there I think they're Chinese people.

464
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:25,760
Speaker 0: I was gonna say I know it's not South Korea because it didn't involve our Starcraft.

465
00:29:26,221 --> 00:29:30,335
Speaker 1: Yeah, so Chinese people did this in their parking garage, which is a pretty cool.

466
00:29:30,816 --> 00:29:31,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, so awesomeness.

467
00:29:32,261 --> 00:29:36,300
Speaker 0: So when I was a kid, there was a video game on the Super Nintendo.

468
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:50,295
Speaker 0: in fact, this game actually had a sequel and The sequel was different but not better to the point that I liked both of these games and played them both all The time and not just by myself, but with my brother and friends.

469
00:29:50,335 --> 00:29:54,687
Speaker 0: I would play these games Constantly hours and hours hours.

470
00:29:54,727 --> 00:30:00,770
Speaker 0: We would sit in my brother's room where the SNES was playing these games Yelling at each other getting super into it.

471
00:30:01,392 --> 00:30:04,126
Speaker 0: These games were called Aerobiz.

472
00:30:04,488 --> 00:30:11,832
Speaker 0: this game was a simulator of global Commercial Airlines and the management of such.

473
00:30:11,872 --> 00:30:13,840
Speaker 0: from the perspective of the CEO.

474
00:30:15,421 --> 00:30:17,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean basically you.

475
00:30:17,489 --> 00:30:21,585
Speaker 1: it was sort of like sim airplane company Like imagine if you were in.

476
00:30:22,067 --> 00:30:31,277
Speaker 1: you were not only the president of say, I don't know Delta Airlines But you were actually every single employee of Delta Airlines except for the pilots and the stewardesses.

477
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:31,879
Speaker 0: not even that.

478
00:30:31,939 --> 00:30:34,107
Speaker 0: no You're really just the CEO.

479
00:30:34,167 --> 00:30:36,696
Speaker 0: You have all these other advisors that do all the real work.

480
00:30:36,736 --> 00:30:37,760
Speaker 1: They don't actually do work.

481
00:30:37,841 --> 00:30:39,019
Speaker 1: They just tell you what to do.

482
00:30:39,301 --> 00:30:44,200
Speaker 1: They don't put them in places and they make numbers change, but you don't think you actually have to make all the decisions.

483
00:30:44,501 --> 00:30:48,040
Speaker 0: But all the decisions you make are the highest level of decisions like they'll advise.

484
00:30:48,401 --> 00:30:51,214
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, how much should a ticket cost from here to here?

485
00:30:51,254 --> 00:30:52,720
Speaker 1: That's not a very high level decision.

486
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,107
Speaker 0: No, you don't even specify direct prices.

487
00:30:55,147 --> 00:30:57,935
Speaker 0: You specify how much are we going to mark this up?

488
00:30:58,477 --> 00:31:04,320
Speaker 0: Yeah I'll tell you this what you want to do is mark everything up all the fucking way.

489
00:31:06,102 --> 00:31:19,039
Speaker 0: But it most of the decisions you make are like, all right It's it's the third quarter and we're down in Asia and international travel routes and because of the war going on in Africa It's really hard like we're having trouble getting people to fly out to whatever.

490
00:31:19,622 --> 00:31:24,680
Speaker 0: Well, I think we should do an advertising campaign stressing the the wide network of our bluff.

491
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:31,440
Speaker 0: I think we should buy this bank bankrupt hotel in Dubai and revamp it and then try to get people to fly there.

492
00:31:31,735 --> 00:31:36,497
Speaker 0: well I think we should buy this charter airline that's going out of business and then sell off all its stock.

493
00:31:36,758 --> 00:31:40,435
Speaker 0: and then you get to Decide which of these things you want to do and then you pick routes and you do things.

494
00:31:40,636 --> 00:31:41,520
Speaker 0: and am I gonna go with?

495
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,804
Speaker 0: Airbus or I'm gonna go with?

496
00:31:43,066 --> 00:31:48,648
Speaker 0: I don't know DC but oh the DC nines are coming out soon But maybe I'll go with that discount.

497
00:31:48,668 --> 00:31:51,540
Speaker 1: can we all go to discount Russian airplanes?

498
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,420
Speaker 0: Tupolev made the shittiest fucking airplanes.

499
00:31:54,864 --> 00:31:56,643
Speaker 0: Good God You know what?

500
00:31:56,663 --> 00:31:57,726
Speaker 0: They weren't even that cheap.

501
00:31:58,027 --> 00:32:00,775
Speaker 0: Like there was no reason to use their shitty like.

502
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:04,043
Speaker 0: I'd always play and be like, oh, man Perestroika.

503
00:32:04,365 --> 00:32:06,496
Speaker 0: now I can buy from Eastern Bloc companies.

504
00:32:06,838 --> 00:32:14,336
Speaker 0: Wow Everything they have is awful awful awful awful And they pollute.

505
00:32:15,066 --> 00:32:16,000
Speaker 0: You know what though?

506
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:21,980
Speaker 0: I often use them anyway because eventually they'd come to me and offer me like 60% discounts if I buy in bulk.

507
00:32:22,366 --> 00:32:32,580
Speaker 0: so I'd buy like 40 Tupolev like to you whatever piece of shits and I just use those in like Africa where no one cared anyway But it would only crashed.

508
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:33,970
Speaker 0: You know what?

509
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:34,698
Speaker 0: I didn't even care.

510
00:32:35,982 --> 00:32:38,913
Speaker 0: The thing is I love these games mine.

511
00:32:39,054 --> 00:32:40,580
Speaker 0: You think it's just like our rims being weird.

512
00:32:40,668 --> 00:32:53,420
Speaker 0: No Me and my brother would play these games all the time with our friends and we get super into him and I've never in my life met a single other human being Who is liked these games.

513
00:32:53,561 --> 00:32:55,740
Speaker 1: I don't think it's a matter of people hating the game.

514
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,524
Speaker 1: It's just a matter of.

515
00:32:56,685 --> 00:33:01,677
Speaker 1: it was sort of an obscure game that like you bought for the SNES But no one else bought for the SNES.

516
00:33:01,798 --> 00:33:03,065
Speaker 1: I Something else.

517
00:33:03,306 --> 00:33:06,080
Speaker 0: I've never even met anyone who thought a game like that would be interesting.

518
00:33:06,182 --> 00:33:15,372
Speaker 0: No I tried to get Scott and everyone to play it in our IT and they'd sit down with me and we'd play for like Ten minutes and then they'd say this game is boring and stupid.

519
00:33:15,432 --> 00:33:15,954
Speaker 1: Well, I wasn't.

520
00:33:16,335 --> 00:33:17,318
Speaker 1: it's not really, you know.

521
00:33:17,338 --> 00:33:18,826
Speaker 1: to be honest It's not a stupid game.

522
00:33:18,846 --> 00:33:26,560
Speaker 1: It's just the play is really slow and You don't get a lot of indications if you're doing well or poorly.

523
00:33:26,981 --> 00:33:31,920
Speaker 0: You get the yearly marketing reports and the quarterly marketing reports that aren't as full featured.

524
00:33:32,162 --> 00:33:41,136
Speaker 1: But give you a nice rough outline and you get this Yeah, but it's like, you know, unless you played the game a lot, you know, you know I mean like I see all I'm profiting hooray, but you're profiting more.

525
00:33:41,156 --> 00:33:41,779
Speaker 1: so to go.

526
00:33:42,261 --> 00:33:48,224
Speaker 0: Well, that's because I've made an international route that no one else had and thus with my monopoly I raised prices.

527
00:33:48,405 --> 00:33:48,667
Speaker 1: Yes.

528
00:33:48,687 --> 00:33:50,878
Speaker 1: Here's the kind of shit that you know, nobody bothers.

529
00:33:52,625 --> 00:33:54,460
Speaker 0: It wasn't really a game of knowledge of the game.

530
00:33:54,521 --> 00:34:04,508
Speaker 0: it was just a game of looking at boring charts and making marketing decisions based on those boring charts and sending people to negotiate for Airport, it's not a game people hate on.

531
00:34:04,548 --> 00:34:06,195
Speaker 1: it's just a game that you were way into.

532
00:34:06,235 --> 00:34:09,868
Speaker 1: that was really obscure And no one not many people know or care about.

533
00:34:10,630 --> 00:34:15,512
Speaker 0: I just I feel sad because a lot of games that I liked Or I'm good at or I think are cool.

534
00:34:15,873 --> 00:34:16,779
Speaker 0: No one else likes.

535
00:34:18,549 --> 00:34:19,998
Speaker 1: I don't have too many games like that.

536
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:21,646
Speaker 0: You have one very in particular.

537
00:34:21,666 --> 00:34:24,940
Speaker 1: you've been bitching about it lately because I bought Yoshi's cookie on the virtual console.

538
00:34:25,342 --> 00:34:26,668
Speaker 0: Cookies terrible game.

539
00:34:26,688 --> 00:34:28,376
Speaker 1: Yoshi's cookie is a fantastic game.

540
00:34:28,536 --> 00:34:29,159
Speaker 1: It's great.

541
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:34,080
Speaker 0: It's a week if all those puzzled upon kind of games are a hundred times better than Yoshi's cookie.

542
00:34:34,179 --> 00:34:35,244
Speaker 1: No, listen Yoshi's cookie.

543
00:34:35,284 --> 00:34:40,444
Speaker 1: The multiplayer is I think if you're looking at puzzle game Multiplayers, right?

544
00:34:40,826 --> 00:34:42,210
Speaker 1: Number one is pride Tetris.

545
00:34:42,632 --> 00:34:45,443
Speaker 1: Number two is probably Dr.

546
00:34:45,503 --> 00:34:47,710
Speaker 1: Mario and number three is probably she's cooking.

547
00:34:48,052 --> 00:34:49,136
Speaker 0: I highly doubt that.

548
00:34:49,216 --> 00:34:50,400
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, what's been Yoshi's cookie?

549
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,243
Speaker 0: That's a little fine.

550
00:34:51,263 --> 00:34:52,909
Speaker 1: No, not really totally.

551
00:34:52,929 --> 00:34:54,917
Speaker 0: No our puzzle bobble.

552
00:34:55,237 --> 00:34:57,165
Speaker 0: No Puyo pops not better.

553
00:34:57,527 --> 00:34:59,915
Speaker 0: No, what about that cool?

554
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:01,260
Speaker 0: all those cool modes of Tetris?

555
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:04,194
Speaker 1: Those are all just Tetris, but they're slightly skewed.

556
00:35:04,255 --> 00:35:04,919
Speaker 1: That doesn't matter.

557
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,299
Speaker 1: Anyway, Yoshi's cookie, right?

558
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:10,311
Speaker 1: the mole and I can tell you the single-player the multiplayer is.

559
00:35:10,351 --> 00:35:33,500
Speaker 1: so it's really cool because the way it works is You have everyone has I think a five by five grid although yeah, I think it's a five by five grid and The five by five grid is filled with cookies of all different shapes and sizes and you want to line up five in a row of the same kind of cookie horizontally or vertically, right and Every time you make a row like a Yoshi cookie shows up.

560
00:35:33,623 --> 00:35:52,699
Speaker 1: It's like, you know It's a cookie with Yoshi's that's shaped like Yoshi's head and you also get some points and you have this like thermometer that fills up as you start to fill up the screen, okay, and So what you can do is the only movements you're allowed to make is you can sort of rotate any Horizontal or vertical row to the left or to the right or up or down?

561
00:35:53,821 --> 00:35:55,389
Speaker 1: So and that's all you can do.

562
00:35:56,032 --> 00:35:57,519
Speaker 1: So, you know you move one cookie.

563
00:35:58,285 --> 00:36:02,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay You're moving four other cookies along with it and that's you know.

564
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:11,374
Speaker 1: So it's sort of difficult to like arrange the cookies exactly the way you want with sort of like those sliding puzzles You know, it's like well if I want to get this over there I got to move all these other things around.

565
00:36:11,394 --> 00:36:17,180
Speaker 1: and So it's sort of a race in one fashion of who can line up cookies the fastest.

566
00:36:17,441 --> 00:36:29,520
Speaker 1: but there's an additional strategy on top of that in which if you line up five Yoshi cookies a Magic power will happen and the magic power is determined by what it says at the top of the screen.

567
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,480
Speaker 1: So one player is red and one player is blue, right?

568
00:36:32,901 --> 00:36:36,339
Speaker 1: And the magic power either has a red ring or a blue ring around it.

569
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:42,258
Speaker 1: So if it has a red ring, that means it will happen to the red player and as a blue ring It'll happen to the blue player.

570
00:36:42,762 --> 00:36:46,120
Speaker 1: So if you line up the Yoshi cookies at say a bad time, right?

571
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:49,939
Speaker 1: You might actually give points to the other guy or take away points from yourself.

572
00:36:50,502 --> 00:36:53,479
Speaker 1: So you start out to wait to use the power at the right time.

573
00:36:54,102 --> 00:36:57,415
Speaker 1: But if you're waiting there to line up your fifth Yoshi cookie, right?

574
00:36:57,435 --> 00:36:58,820
Speaker 1: You got four or five Yoshi cookies.

575
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:01,919
Speaker 1: You're just waiting to move the last one into place for the power to change.

576
00:37:02,462 --> 00:37:07,085
Speaker 1: The other guy could be making a whole bunch of lines and scoring while you're sitting there and waiting for this thing to change.

577
00:37:07,388 --> 00:37:07,731
Speaker 0: I don't know.

578
00:37:07,751 --> 00:37:13,333
Speaker 1: I much prefer my Marketing graphs, but it's on top of that, right?

579
00:37:13,774 --> 00:37:15,520
Speaker 1: Okay, so I'm not gonna wait for it to change.

580
00:37:15,641 --> 00:37:23,880
Speaker 1: I'm gonna actually try to complete lines of cookies You know to try to keep my score going up and then when the power changes then I'll line up the ocean cookies really quick.

581
00:37:24,562 --> 00:37:27,453
Speaker 1: The problem with that is that okay, you keep making lines.

582
00:37:27,473 --> 00:37:29,200
Speaker 1: You keep getting more Yoshi cookies.

583
00:37:29,522 --> 00:37:34,265
Speaker 1: Eventually, you're gonna line them up no matter what you're gonna you know Because moving one cookie moves for others.

584
00:37:34,806 --> 00:37:37,332
Speaker 1: it gets pretty hairy in there managing all them cookies.

585
00:37:37,794 --> 00:37:38,716
Speaker 1: and it's actually.

586
00:37:38,736 --> 00:37:41,592
Speaker 1: it's a really good multiplayer puzzle game.

587
00:37:41,632 --> 00:37:44,458
Speaker 1: a single-player is Okay, but not as great.

588
00:37:45,522 --> 00:37:48,479
Speaker 1: But the multiplayer is really hot, but no one ever wants to play with me.

589
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:57,039
Speaker 0: Yeah See I think what I notice is that There's a trend and I know a lot of gamers have games like this where You whatever reason a game tickles your fancy and you really like it.

590
00:37:57,421 --> 00:38:05,119
Speaker 0: So you play it enough to become non trivially good at it Like you become really good at it, but no one else really gets into it.

591
00:38:05,461 --> 00:38:10,679
Speaker 0: so you never really get to use all these intricate skills and things you've figured out or care about.

592
00:38:10,719 --> 00:38:19,500
Speaker 0: and The worst thing is if you ever convince someone to play with you You're so good that they're not going to invest the crazy amount of time that you invested to get that good at the game.

593
00:38:20,024 --> 00:38:30,840
Speaker 0: so you pretty much have made a self-limiting world where unless you happen to run into the one person out there who Independently cared about that game as much as you did and achieved a similar level of skill.

594
00:38:31,582 --> 00:38:33,869
Speaker 0: You're never ever ever gonna be able to show this off.

595
00:38:33,949 --> 00:38:39,645
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like you found a great game, but it's either hated or So unpopular.

596
00:38:40,006 --> 00:38:44,809
Speaker 1: right that if you invest in it and there's a multiplayer aspect You're not.

597
00:38:44,870 --> 00:38:45,879
Speaker 1: there's no one to play against.

598
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:49,029
Speaker 0: Popular with air hockey is a big example of this.

599
00:38:49,331 --> 00:39:03,390
Speaker 0: if you actually try to get good at air hockey you'll pretty much immediately find out that you're now a thousand times better than everyone, you know, and League air hockey players are difficult to find.

600
00:39:03,410 --> 00:39:05,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not that difficult to find the email though.

601
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,020
Speaker 1: So we did an air hockey episode.

602
00:39:07,372 --> 00:39:15,220
Speaker 0: Yeah But it's it's difficult to like get them together to play air hockey with you conveniently Mmm, or like you're never gonna find anyone who's gonna play Yoshi's cookie with you.

603
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:22,351
Speaker 0: You got to get him to come to the house or go to their house bust open the Yoshi's cookie Sit down and have your deathmatch.

604
00:39:22,572 --> 00:39:22,894
Speaker 0: Yeah.

605
00:39:22,914 --> 00:39:24,743
Speaker 1: Oh Yeah, she's cookie.

606
00:39:25,184 --> 00:39:25,506
Speaker 0: Yeah, mom.

607
00:39:26,389 --> 00:39:28,799
Speaker 0: I guess my sad thing is that I have a lot of games like that.

608
00:39:29,582 --> 00:39:30,104
Speaker 1: I don't have.

609
00:39:30,546 --> 00:39:31,008
Speaker 1: I can't really.

610
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:34,180
Speaker 1: I'm sure I might have other games like that, but I can't think of them.

611
00:39:34,220 --> 00:39:39,025
Speaker 1: It's much eat because I guess people, you know They like a more known.

612
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:41,812
Speaker 1: well, they're not liking games that other people like.

613
00:39:41,973 --> 00:39:43,015
Speaker 1: there's no more.

614
00:39:43,176 --> 00:39:44,559
Speaker 0: but you never even got good at that.

615
00:39:45,121 --> 00:39:47,129
Speaker 0: No, no, I don't think anyone can get good at it.

616
00:39:47,169 --> 00:39:47,952
Speaker 0: I think it's random.

617
00:39:48,615 --> 00:39:48,876
Speaker 1: Yeah.

618
00:39:49,559 --> 00:39:51,547
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I see board games that I like that.

619
00:39:51,587 --> 00:39:52,028
Speaker 1: No one else.

620
00:39:52,129 --> 00:39:53,856
Speaker 0: you really really you're like.

621
00:39:53,876 --> 00:39:56,880
Speaker 0: you bought battle or you're like Yeah, and I was like wow this game sucks.

622
00:39:56,900 --> 00:40:00,679
Speaker 1: Well, I'd heard so much great things about it and I still think it's better than you think it is.

623
00:40:02,424 --> 00:40:03,086
Speaker 1: But it's not.

624
00:40:03,206 --> 00:40:03,928
Speaker 1: it's not great.

625
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:06,215
Speaker 0: But I always say I'll play it if you'll set it up.

626
00:40:06,736 --> 00:40:08,080
Speaker 1: Yeah set up is very annoying.

627
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:10,978
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I'm editor return to my original plan of.

628
00:40:11,059 --> 00:40:14,658
Speaker 1: well It has a bunch of miniatures we can paint with or something, but we're awful at that.

629
00:40:15,241 --> 00:40:17,930
Speaker 1: You always try you could practice on shitty battle or pieces.

630
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:20,900
Speaker 0: You're always trying to get us to play the Egyptian slot machine.

631
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:27,126
Speaker 1: I'm not always trying to get you to play the always suggested kinda Actually the Dracula game.

632
00:40:27,146 --> 00:40:33,506
Speaker 1: I could actually you know, I whenever I suggest it It's like only it's sort of half Sarcastically but half I kind of like.

633
00:40:33,667 --> 00:40:38,082
Speaker 0: I only like it if I'm Dracula and if I don't have to set it up or tear It down.

634
00:40:38,624 --> 00:40:43,000
Speaker 1: Well, it's like I kind of I really don't like the combat and I don't like the when the game takes too long.

635
00:40:43,401 --> 00:40:44,044
Speaker 1: But I do.

636
00:40:44,225 --> 00:40:47,820
Speaker 1: I really like Dracula's hidden movement and the chase for Dracula.

637
00:40:47,942 --> 00:40:52,776
Speaker 0: I like that part a lot Debated a lot how to take that Dracula game and make it really good cuz it's so.

638
00:40:52,816 --> 00:40:56,935
Speaker 1: so it's like I kind of want to Play it just for that, you know hidden card movement part.

639
00:40:56,975 --> 00:40:57,860
Speaker 1: That's really awesome.

640
00:40:58,643 --> 00:41:00,410
Speaker 0: I just have this problem a lot more with Scott.

641
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,040
Speaker 0: then Scott with video games like gem fire.

642
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:10,869
Speaker 1: And oh, that's another example where it's not because people hate gem fires because it was an obscure game gear game And you were probably the only people who bought it.

643
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,939
Speaker 0: It was on the Super Nintendo and the Nintendo.

644
00:41:14,041 --> 00:41:14,342
Speaker 1: What's the?

645
00:41:14,382 --> 00:41:15,588
Speaker 1: what's the game gear?

646
00:41:15,729 --> 00:41:17,055
Speaker 0: one crystal warrior?

647
00:41:17,195 --> 00:41:25,580
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the same one though Not even close that game crystal warriors for the game gear was basically advanced wars with fantasy piece.

648
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:26,566
Speaker 1: So it was the gem fire.

649
00:41:26,586 --> 00:41:27,531
Speaker 0: No, no.

650
00:41:27,552 --> 00:41:28,739
Speaker 1: No, I said.

651
00:41:28,799 --> 00:41:30,083
Speaker 1: so What was the gem fire?

652
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:30,485
Speaker 0: fire?

653
00:41:30,685 --> 00:41:33,976
Speaker 0: was the game where you have a map of something that's vaguely Britain?

654
00:41:34,598 --> 00:41:35,300
Speaker 1: All right that.

655
00:41:35,621 --> 00:41:38,150
Speaker 0: Okay, gem fires from a whole class of games.

656
00:41:38,211 --> 00:41:38,351
Speaker 1: Wait.

657
00:41:38,391 --> 00:41:39,736
Speaker 1: Wait, what was the cuz?

00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:41,442
Speaker 1: I don't like.

660
00:41:41,482 --> 00:41:42,104
Speaker 1: I tried to play it.

661
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:42,666
Speaker 1: I didn't like it.

662
00:41:42,947 --> 00:41:44,894
Speaker 1: But what was that PC one?

663
00:41:44,914 --> 00:41:46,159
Speaker 1: That was a TSR game.

664
00:41:46,179 --> 00:41:49,406
Speaker 0: Oh A Fantasy fantasy empires.

665
00:41:49,426 --> 00:41:50,912
Speaker 1: I actually like that one.

666
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:52,559
Speaker 0: No, no, you don't you think you do?

667
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:54,226
Speaker 1: I liked it when he played it.

668
00:41:54,407 --> 00:41:56,477
Speaker 0: you liked it because you did not play it long enough.

669
00:41:57,020 --> 00:42:00,730
Speaker 0: I invested Countless months into that game.

670
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:01,938
Speaker 0: I played it for maybe a half hour.

671
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,231
Speaker 0: I am probably better than any living human being at that game.

672
00:42:05,693 --> 00:42:07,660
Speaker 1: Let me tell you I liked it for a half hour.

673
00:42:07,941 --> 00:42:12,500
Speaker 0: Let me tell you and I had we continued that game that we had started with all of our friends.

674
00:42:12,982 --> 00:42:20,372
Speaker 0: It would have taken weeks of daily play for it to breach its bitter bitter conclusion You wanted you would have ended.

675
00:42:20,452 --> 00:42:22,000
Speaker 0: play a broken man.

676
00:42:24,462 --> 00:42:27,190
Speaker 0: Tell you gem fire is a really good game though.

677
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:32,375
Speaker 0: Yeah, you played it for like five minutes and said I played it a few more times than that.

678
00:42:32,516 --> 00:42:35,968
Speaker 0: Oh you didn't And you didn't read the instruction book.

679
00:42:36,109 --> 00:42:36,530
Speaker 0: You didn't know.

680
00:42:36,571 --> 00:42:37,976
Speaker 1: I don't have the instruction book.

681
00:42:38,277 --> 00:42:39,080
Speaker 0: That's the problem.

682
00:42:40,021 --> 00:42:41,326
Speaker 0: See there's this whole class of games.

683
00:42:41,346 --> 00:42:44,136
Speaker 0: there was one that simulated the Revolutionary War in the u.s.

684
00:42:44,457 --> 00:42:45,320
Speaker 0: And there was gem fire.

685
00:42:45,381 --> 00:42:51,975
Speaker 0: they're all made for the same people they all look the same and They were games of there's territories and they're all numbered.

686
00:42:52,176 --> 00:42:54,727
Speaker 0: you look at these games you go Oh, it's one of those games because it's always like.

687
00:42:54,807 --> 00:43:03,200
Speaker 1: it looks a lot like no banagas ambition and romance No bungas ambition and romance of the three kingdoms.

688
00:43:03,341 --> 00:43:04,506
Speaker 1: Those are the same kind of game.

689
00:43:04,546 --> 00:43:12,609
Speaker 0: but gem fire like these games on the SNES were like the best implementation that could have been done with the technology at the time and they're a lot better than those other games.

690
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:15,289
Speaker 0: and they were games of like.

691
00:43:15,309 --> 00:43:30,378
Speaker 0: there'd be like five factions and you have to deal with like the crown and then you have your like vassals that control different territories and you invest in agriculture defense and you raise armies and then you fight with each other with the politics and It was a really fun game.

692
00:43:31,060 --> 00:43:36,118
Speaker 0: I've beaten every possible scenario with every possible family and gotten every possible ending.

693
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:40,309
Speaker 1: really Yes, Wow Including I think you went that far.

694
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:41,594
Speaker 0: I did because I've.

695
00:43:41,654 --> 00:43:43,000
Speaker 1: was that when you're a punk kid?

696
00:43:43,261 --> 00:43:45,934
Speaker 0: No, that was when I was living in fish kill.

697
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:54,918
Speaker 0: Oh god I've never ever other than when I was a kid been able to play this game against another human being.

698
00:43:54,998 --> 00:43:58,055
Speaker 0: no one has ever Accepted a play with this game.

699
00:43:58,337 --> 00:44:01,071
Speaker 1: Yeah See I have a hard time because it's like.

700
00:44:01,091 --> 00:44:02,357
Speaker 1: you refer to it as like games.

701
00:44:02,398 --> 00:44:03,703
Speaker 1: you like that No one else likes.

702
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,480
Speaker 1: and that sort of implies that it's because you like a game that you know.

703
00:44:07,540 --> 00:44:08,042
Speaker 1: Most people are.

704
00:44:08,183 --> 00:44:09,991
Speaker 1: you know hate like what's the game?

705
00:44:10,012 --> 00:44:10,976
Speaker 1: A lot of people hate.

706
00:44:11,036 --> 00:44:14,945
Speaker 1: Let me try to think Die katana, right?

707
00:44:15,185 --> 00:44:19,781
Speaker 1: So if I decide if I like die katana, which I don't I don't like die katana I get on.

708
00:44:19,822 --> 00:44:21,026
Speaker 0: it wasn't that bad.

709
00:44:21,066 --> 00:44:21,628
Speaker 1: It's pretty bad.

710
00:44:21,688 --> 00:44:21,989
Speaker 0: It's just.

711
00:44:22,330 --> 00:44:24,317
Speaker 0: there were expectations that it did not meet.

712
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:25,220
Speaker 1: a fine.

713
00:44:25,582 --> 00:44:26,890

Speaker 0: that game was bad.

715
00:44:29,302 --> 00:44:31,849
Speaker 1: So if I liked fester's quest that would be.

716
00:44:31,869 --> 00:44:33,554
Speaker 1: I like a game that no one else likes.

717

Speaker 1: but if I like, you know Gem fire gem fire.

718

Speaker 0: No one will play it because I Well, no one will play.

723
00:44:52,905 --> 00:44:55,716

724
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:56,800
Speaker 0: gem fire is trivial to get.

725
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,212
Speaker 0: I know a lot of you gonna think oh and you're gonna get the ROM.

726
00:44:59,232 --> 00:45:00,720
Speaker 0: You're gonna be like, alright, I'll play this game.

727
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:05,624
Speaker 0: I can be all cool like rim thinks and I'll go play this game and I'll email and be like, yeah I played that game.

728
00:45:06,087 --> 00:45:07,192
Speaker 0: You're not really gonna play it.

729
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:08,680
Speaker 0: You're not gonna learn about it.

730
00:45:08,841 --> 00:45:11,640
Speaker 0: You're not gonna Yoshi's cookie it and figure out the strategy.

731
00:45:12,122 --> 00:45:16,280
Speaker 0: You're not gonna think about how awesome the game would be if you played it with another human being.

732
00:45:17,221 --> 00:45:18,928
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the game sucks against the AI.

733
00:45:18,968 --> 00:45:19,892
Speaker 0: cuz AI is stupid.

734
00:45:19,912 --> 00:45:21,599
Speaker 0: You'll figure out how to beat the AI like that.

735
00:45:23,563 --> 00:45:28,984
Speaker 0: Of course I'm also weird in that I really really like all those Second sequels.

736
00:45:29,224 --> 00:45:37,448
Speaker 0: like my favorite Mario game is almost Mario - it ends up being Mario 3, but it's almost Mario - yeah My favorite Zelda game is still Zelda -.

737
00:45:37,468 --> 00:45:47,084
Speaker 0: my favorite Castlevania game is far and away Actually is the DS one but number two right after it is Simon's quest.

738
00:45:47,445 --> 00:45:48,509
Speaker 0: I love that game.

739
00:45:49,352 --> 00:45:50,937
Speaker 1: Oh, you've all the worst ones.

740
00:45:51,057 --> 00:45:51,820
Speaker 0: the game is great.

741
00:45:51,981 --> 00:45:55,732
Speaker 1: Hey Mario - you know slash doki-doki panic is a good game.

742
00:45:55,773 --> 00:45:58,080
Speaker 0: Don't say that doki-doki panic was a terrible game.

743
00:45:58,120 --> 00:46:03,344
Speaker 1: I'm saying, you know, I said, you know, I'm just using the doki-doki panic to you know Which Mario - I'm talking about?

744
00:46:03,725 --> 00:46:10,819
Speaker 0: Well, because no one knows Mario - is Mario - they notice Mario - J or the lost levels Which by the way is sucked balls.

745
00:46:11,381 --> 00:46:24,215
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Mario - is better than Mario - USA is better than Mario - J and it's better than some other Mario games like Mario's time machine or Mario is missing and some others.

746
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:33,779
Speaker 1: but Other than that Mario 3 Mario World Mario 1 all better than Mario - it is way down there.

747
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:38,670
Speaker 1: Castlevania - awesome, probably the worst Castlevania.

748
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,778
Speaker 0: Have you fucking played how many Castlevania's you play?

749
00:46:41,798 --> 00:46:46,037
Speaker 0: There's one two Four wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

750
00:46:46,841 --> 00:46:47,464
Speaker 0: What about three?

751
00:46:47,484 --> 00:46:49,672
Speaker 0: I didn't play that never played three.

752
00:46:49,812 --> 00:46:51,659
Speaker 0: now, you know anything about it?

753
00:46:52,183 --> 00:46:54,339
Speaker 1: It looks a lot like one not really.

754
00:46:55,381 --> 00:47:03,863
Speaker 1: Anyway, one two four deep two DS games And The Genesis one.

755
00:47:03,883 --> 00:47:06,491
Speaker 1: Dracula X the only fail in Castlevania 64.

756
00:47:06,491 --> 00:47:10,902
Speaker 1: Oh, I know Castlevania 64 is the worst Castlevania.

757
00:47:11,144 --> 00:47:12,932
Speaker 1: Castlevania 2 is the second worst.

758
00:47:13,012 --> 00:47:17,788
Speaker 0: I think the only failing of Castlevania 2 is that the boss battles are weak.

759
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:20,777
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it's just not good.

760
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:21,800
Speaker 1: It's a really good game.

761
00:47:22,341 --> 00:47:23,143
Speaker 0: It's really fun.

762
00:47:23,544 --> 00:47:25,229
Speaker 0: And Zelda 2 is fucking epic.

763
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:26,973
Speaker 1: Zelda 2 is a good game.

764
00:47:26,993 --> 00:47:29,440
Speaker 1: It's probably the worst Zelda game what?

765
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,378
Speaker 1: Okay, Minish Cap is worse.

766
00:47:37,463 --> 00:47:39,429
Speaker 1: It is the third worst Zelda game.

767
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:44,060
Speaker 0: actually I didn't really enjoy those like Game Boy Color ones that much I like the game.

768
00:47:44,261 --> 00:47:47,159
Speaker 1: I like all portable Zelda's that Minish Cap a lot.

769
00:47:47,681 --> 00:47:53,140
Speaker 0: Minish Cap would have been fun if I hadn't played other Zelda games before like if I hadn't really played other Zelda games.

770
00:47:53,140 --> 00:47:57,018
Speaker 1: Yeah, if that's the first Zelda if you're gonna play Minish Cap make it the first Zelda game you ever play.

771
00:47:57,058 --> 00:47:58,108
Speaker 1: that way It's like awesome.

772
00:47:58,310 --> 00:48:02,853
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz it is awesome If you haven't played others, I actually I like those Game Boy ones like the most.

773
00:48:02,994 --> 00:48:15,513
Speaker 0: main thing is I think what it was is Zelda 2 unlike most other Zelda's had a couple of these really really Epic tasks in terms of the sheer amount of pain and effort.

774
00:48:15,954 --> 00:48:17,780
Speaker 1: and and the pain is that made it unfun.

775
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:22,735
Speaker 0: No, the pain was awesome because pain directly translates into accomplishment.

776
00:48:22,755 --> 00:48:27,099
Speaker 0: I mean if you beat the Silver Surfer The pain is not worth it.

777
00:48:27,402 --> 00:48:33,132
Speaker 0: If you're not going to beat the Silver Surfer Don't play it because the pain will only add up and you will never get the end.

778
00:48:33,754 --> 00:48:41,940
Speaker 0: if you know if you are willing to Beat the Silver Surfer then all of that pain turns into glorious glorious triumph.

779
00:48:44,044 --> 00:48:46,460
Speaker 1: You and you just wasted like how much time in your life.

780
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:55,259
Speaker 0: Well, that's a bad example because it would take most of an adult's life active life to beat the Silver Surfer legitimately but Zelda 2 had the hammer.

781
00:48:55,823 --> 00:48:59,884
Speaker 0: Going after the hammer is one of the many cherished memories You don't already like.

782
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:15,178
Speaker 0: if you're not And know how to get the hammer you will have that moment where you get to a screen and you've been playing for like two Hours and you have one life left and that screen looks different because there's all these pillars.

783
00:49:15,198 --> 00:49:15,720
Speaker 0: in the background.

784
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:23,220
Speaker 0: It's really tall and you see the hammer and in front of it You see those fucking red rhino guys with maces.

785
00:49:23,381 --> 00:49:29,520
Speaker 1: It's one, you know upright red like stark red alligator and he doesn't have a mace.

786
00:49:29,742 --> 00:49:44,137
Speaker 1: He's throwing axes at you Other than those jumpy nights at the end of the game pretty much one of the hardest guys and if you get hit by those Axes you are fucked and throwing axes at you rapidly like imagine if I had hatched my.

787
00:49:44,277 --> 00:49:50,200
Speaker 1: I could just make hatchets Appear out of the sky and then fling them at you like an Olympian throws the discus.

788
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:51,667
Speaker 1: No in a rapid succession.

789
00:49:51,748 --> 00:49:54,079
Speaker 0: that your shield means nothing to him.

790
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:59,080
Speaker 0: No an axe your shield is nothing and you probably like you're you'll be like.

791
00:49:59,240 --> 00:49:59,783
Speaker 0: What do I do?

792
00:49:59,963 --> 00:50:00,546
Speaker 0: What do I do?

793
00:50:00,787 --> 00:50:03,919
Speaker 0: and you might have enough magic left to cast jump?

794
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:07,771
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe I remember I or shield.

795
00:50:08,313 --> 00:50:09,417
Speaker 0: I got there fairy.

796
00:50:09,437 --> 00:50:10,280
Speaker 1: the fairy doesn't help you.

797
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:11,968
Speaker 0: Well, he would but you don't have a magic.

798
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:14,080
Speaker 1: Well, no the fairy can't pick up the hammer depends.

799
00:50:15,281 --> 00:50:23,504
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I just jump jump over him and I run and there's the hammer and I grab it and link is standing there holding Up going dee dee dee.

800
00:50:23,806 --> 00:50:27,420
Speaker 1: Meanwhile, the axe guy is right next to link paused as it goes.

801
00:50:27,541 --> 00:50:28,326
Speaker 0: Why?

802
00:50:28,971 --> 00:50:34,984
Speaker 0: as I grab the hammer It hits me and I die game over.

803
00:50:35,004 --> 00:50:41,124
Speaker 0: I remember as a kid I cried I Cried.

804
00:50:41,144 --> 00:50:53,210
Speaker 0: I remember other Zelda game has ever made me cry except Almost with sadness at a couple of points, but never with real world pain and desperation.

805
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:54,890
Speaker 0: My mother runs in.

806
00:50:55,111 --> 00:50:55,675
Speaker 0: what's wrong?

807
00:50:55,856 --> 00:50:56,340
Speaker 0: What's wrong?

808
00:50:58,100 --> 00:51:01,108
Speaker 1: Ah Come on.

809
00:51:01,149 --> 00:51:10,066
Speaker 1: the game basically Right limits you to this incredibly small area and the only way out of the small area is if you get the hammer to break The rocks but getting the hammer.

810
00:51:10,086 --> 00:51:28,884
Speaker 1: you have to go on this epic quest through all these dangerous dangerous caves and this maze And if you don't know your way through the maze it could take you forever to get through the maze and it's really really hard And long and then if you actually make it out with the hammer Suddenly the whole game opens up to you like I can go places Yes,

811
00:51:29,125 --> 00:51:31,840
Speaker 0: and all just because it was so hard to get the hammer.

812
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:37,660
Speaker 0: You've been seeing these rocks the whole game and then you finally get the instruction book.

813
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,150
Speaker 1: you need the hammer to break the rocks

814
00:51:39,271 --> 00:51:52,459
Speaker 0: and you I after crying and all that I finally get the hammer and I go to that rock and I hit a and the rock disappears and I take a pause and I take a step and Suddenly I'm in this new world.

815
00:51:52,762 --> 00:51:53,815
Speaker 1: It's like even Metroid.

816
00:51:53,855 --> 00:52:05,768
Speaker 1: imagine like if you know there were only like ten doors that would open with the regular gun and all the other doors are missile doors and the missiles were like By a hind like a hundred bosses

817
00:52:06,028 --> 00:52:11,344
Speaker 0: like to the point that you would call your friend and say hey Joey I'm going for the hammer.

818
00:52:11,384 --> 00:52:14,349
Speaker 0: You want to watch I got the missiles.

819
00:52:14,590 --> 00:52:15,331
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

820
00:52:15,451 --> 00:52:28,814
Speaker 0: I Oh Those were good days before I was demystified about everything in the world.

821
00:52:28,874 --> 00:52:30,520
Speaker 1: video games had to be like that again.

822
00:52:31,162 --> 00:52:33,368
Speaker 1: I don't know how I don't know how either.

823
00:52:33,388 --> 00:52:45,993
Speaker 0: I think the moral is there's any any of you out there Play and or like gem fire Yoshi's cookie or arrow biz or if you're epic Aerobiz supersonic.

824
00:52:46,740 --> 00:52:48,160
Speaker 1: Supersonic I think is better than regular.

825
00:52:48,220 --> 00:52:51,030
Speaker 0: It was better in some ways but they took the stock element out.

826
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:51,311
Speaker 0: good.

827
00:52:51,351 --> 00:52:53,759
Speaker 0: You couldn't buy stock in other airlines.

828
00:52:53,799 --> 00:52:59,299
Speaker 1: good There's less bullshit to worry about In the airplanes which have enough trouble concentrating on to begin with.

829
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:03,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, are there any games?

830
00:53:03,325 --> 00:53:06,215
Speaker 1: they're like you like that are just super obscure and no one's heard of.

831
00:53:06,536 --> 00:53:09,132
Speaker 0: or games that you like that Everyone else gives you shit about.

832
00:53:09,455 --> 00:53:11,431
Speaker 0: yeah Simon's quest.

833
