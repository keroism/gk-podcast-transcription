1
00:00:09,740 --> 00:00:11,361
Speaker 0: Hey, it's Wednesday October 28th.

2
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:16,960
Speaker 0: I'm rim God over Skype, and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:20,470
Speaker 0: We talk about a comic packs Romana by the Hickman.

4
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:26,918
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:30,961 --> 00:00:33,508
Speaker 0: That static you hear in the background can only mean one thing.

6
00:00:33,949 --> 00:00:35,614
Speaker 0: It's fads karate for the geek nights.

7
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:36,777
Speaker 0: I have scott on Skype.

8
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:41,079
Speaker 0: Oh Shit, I feel like we don't clap, but we're not going to do that.

9
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:45,220
Speaker 0: That double record sinking just yet since this is kind of off the cuff.

10
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:49,860
Speaker 1: That's also because we have the skills to use the mixer to do the one-side record.

11
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:53,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, but at the same time it sounds a lot better if you do the two-side record.

12
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:58,763
Speaker 0: But I'm lazy and basically my plan is you know I don't want to We're.

13
00:00:58,783 --> 00:01:00,200
Speaker 0: we're still like you guys are lucky.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:10,260
Speaker 0: We're doing shows at all for the next like two weeks because everything's just crazy as we're trying to like shuffle all these houses around And I got all this other stuff going on, but in moving moving you know I mean people are worried.

15
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:11,898
Speaker 1: Oh, no geek that will be no more.

16
00:01:11,959 --> 00:01:17,920
Speaker 1: well That's not true, but what is true is that you know when people are moving they got a. you're constantly got shit to do.

17
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:19,873
Speaker 1: That's more important than a podcast.

18
00:01:19,893 --> 00:01:22,222
Speaker 1: They are not paid for You know.

19
00:01:22,263 --> 00:01:23,768
Speaker 0: so yeah, well partly that too is.

20
00:01:23,808 --> 00:01:27,803
Speaker 0: I still don't have a car and Scott won't let me drive his car even though It's here.

21
00:01:27,823 --> 00:01:28,850
Speaker 0: Oh good.

22
00:01:28,910 --> 00:01:30,179
Speaker 1: You are not driving the car.

23
00:01:30,521 --> 00:01:31,365
Speaker 0: I used a little like.

24
00:01:31,385 --> 00:01:34,019
Speaker 0: I said I took it grocery shopping once and that was it.

25
00:01:34,764 --> 00:01:37,240
Speaker 0: Okay, good, cuz I needed grocery shopping something fierce.

26
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:41,260
Speaker 0: I was out of food and so was Emily the car speaking of the car.

27
00:01:42,262 --> 00:01:52,160
Speaker 1: Right I was going around the internet changing my address at various places And I changed it at Geico where I'm supposed to change it and they made your insurance go up hold on.

28
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:59,620
Speaker 1: They asked me in the end on the internet You know are you bringing the car with you, and I said no they said where are you leaving the car?

29
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,029
Speaker 1: I said in Beacon how long for a couple months.

30
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:04,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, they said how come you're not bringing it with you?

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:07,782
Speaker 1: And I'm like because there's nowhere to park and I can take the subway to work Uh-huh.

32
00:02:08,404 --> 00:02:10,972
Speaker 1: so then they called me this morning, and it's a uh-huh.

33
00:02:11,051 --> 00:02:13,340
Speaker 1: so why aren't you bringing the car with you?

34
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,570
Speaker 1: I'm like yeah, because there's no parking and right.

35
00:02:15,590 --> 00:02:16,434
Speaker 1: so they asked me again.

36
00:02:16,494 --> 00:02:17,640
Speaker 1: Why I'm not and they're like.

37
00:02:18,424 --> 00:02:21,333
Speaker 1: They're like Well, no no no no so then they're like.

38
00:02:21,353 --> 00:02:25,428
Speaker 1: well, you know Even whether you're bringing the car with you or not.

39
00:02:25,509 --> 00:02:28,258
Speaker 1: we have to charge you as if you have the car with you.

40
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:29,424
Speaker 1: regardless I'm like.

41
00:02:29,484 --> 00:02:31,097
Speaker 1: so why did you even ask me?

42
00:02:32,202 --> 00:02:38,486
Speaker 1: Right like why ask me whether or not I'm bringing the car with me or why if it doesn't matter I don't even know.

43
00:02:38,527 --> 00:02:40,060
Speaker 0: I used to just lie on that stupid thing.

44
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:43,060
Speaker 0: They made me fill out anyway cuz I was like if they're gonna drive to work.

45
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:51,920
Speaker 1: Hey funny as if the car is in Astoria Why even bother asking where the car is or the reasons for the car being where it is?

46
00:02:52,821 --> 00:02:56,235
Speaker 0: There's some way where they don't have to turn cuz they don't have to.

47
00:02:56,275 --> 00:02:57,300
Speaker 0: they can charge whatever they want.

48
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,155
Speaker 0: That's just him saying some you know Lady but you know whatever.

49
00:03:02,175 --> 00:03:09,289
Speaker 0: yeah But I mean most likely if your answer had been like I'm leaving it in a garage upstate And I take a train up to take it whenever going a road trip.

50
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:10,494
Speaker 0: They would have been like.

51
00:03:10,655 --> 00:03:12,504
Speaker 1: that's what I told them Really?

52
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:13,411
Speaker 1: Yes.

53
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,363
Speaker 0: Oh Well, that's it.

54
00:03:15,504 --> 00:03:20,065
Speaker 0: At least you can say, you know, you don't use the car to commute because that cut down on my insurance more Than anything.

55
00:03:20,853 --> 00:03:21,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's true.

56
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:27,037
Speaker 0: But now my $8 a month of car insurance my car is worth less than like the chair.

57
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:28,020
Speaker 0: I'm sitting in right now.

58
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:33,136
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the insurance is now like $800 a year like four payments of 200 something each.

59
00:03:33,618 --> 00:03:35,121
Speaker 0: that's not too bad Now.

60
00:03:35,201 --> 00:03:41,588
Speaker 1: before it was four payments of like a hundred and forty each so it went up by six to like two hundred and forty Dollars a year.

61
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,119
Speaker 1: Oh, wow Yeah, we'll see what happens with that.

62
00:03:45,282 --> 00:03:45,976
Speaker 1: You know, I'm gonna.

63
00:03:45,997 --> 00:03:49,500
Speaker 1: you know I'm gonna keep the car and if you know we'll see how much I actually end up using it.

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,050
Speaker 1: Like if I don't use it for like months on end and don't have it, you know desire or need to use it.

65
00:03:54,913 --> 00:04:03,490
Speaker 1: For you know Even though I really like the car and I've wanted to keep it for a long time and I completely own it If I sell it, I'll get a huge pile of money and I'll be able to just go.

66
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:04,998
Speaker 1: Ah, I don't need to worry about money.

67
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:06,848
Speaker 0: Ah, yep, but then you won't have a car.

68
00:04:07,593 --> 00:04:10,248
Speaker 1: But if I'm not using it for months on end, what will it matter?

69
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:10,610
Speaker 1: Yeah

70
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:18,257
Speaker 0: Well, then you'll have to do what I was doing for a while Where whenever you want to go on a trip and someone else isn't driving you got to rent the car and go pick it up and like, you know,

71
00:04:19,101 --> 00:04:22,540
Speaker 1: or maybe I can you know Get the car or something

72
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:24,270
Speaker 0: that car is not worth the money.

73
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:26,729
Speaker 0: You're better off just renting an individual car every time you need it.

74
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:28,374
Speaker 1: I know it depends though.

75
00:04:28,394 --> 00:04:33,367
Speaker 1: Like if I use the zipcar a lot or you know, it's it's it's you got to calculate.

76
00:04:33,749 --> 00:04:34,853
Speaker 1: for some people It's worth it.

77
00:04:35,155 --> 00:04:37,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, but not I don't think I want to buy your car.

78
00:04:37,730 --> 00:04:41,370
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy a scojo super cheap car and I'm saying it's a better car to buy.

79
00:04:41,711 --> 00:04:46,143
Speaker 0: Well, I only need a hold out until I got settled in house business cuz.

80
00:04:46,203 --> 00:04:50,942
Speaker 0: once all that settled I was gonna buy like a fit And maybe a Miata and then I'll be set.

81
00:04:51,686 --> 00:04:52,389
Speaker 1: you buy two cars.

82
00:04:52,671 --> 00:04:58,135
Speaker 0: Well Emily's gonna get the fit and I'm gonna get like a Miata or a z4 Like this fit car.

83
00:04:58,155 --> 00:05:03,430
Speaker 0: It's just a really it's like it's the same like kind of car as your Mazda 3 except it's smaller.

84
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:05,677
Speaker 0: It's a lot smaller and it's cute.

85
00:05:05,697 --> 00:05:07,943
Speaker 1: Oh, it's also less speedy.

86
00:05:08,465 --> 00:05:09,929
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you don't need speed so much.

87
00:05:11,152 --> 00:05:12,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, my car is cool.

88
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,229
Speaker 0: Not for driving around town.

89
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:23,490
Speaker 0: Plus what I'm thinking about doing seriously is it will have for a while have like one maybe like the dumper car And the nice car I might just buy like a little vespa to go around upstating.

90
00:05:24,611 --> 00:05:25,537
Speaker 1: It's not a bad idea.

91
00:05:25,698 --> 00:05:29,156
Speaker 0: cuz I'm going to the train station and stuff like that I just parked it with the bikes.

92
00:05:29,859 --> 00:05:32,270
Speaker 1: I could get one of those if I was in Manhattan, but I'm in Queens.

93
00:05:32,390 --> 00:05:33,013
Speaker 1: So that's not.

94
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:36,770
Speaker 0: I guess if you're gonna drive you got to use a car in Queens.

95
00:05:37,473 --> 00:05:38,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not gonna.

96
00:05:38,599 --> 00:05:40,669
Speaker 1: thing is if I here's the other thing though, right?

97
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:42,696
Speaker 1: You know, it's like oh man the car.

98
00:05:42,857 --> 00:05:48,079
Speaker 1: if I get like a raise of like $1,200 a year I don't think that's gonna happen very soon.

99
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:49,505
Speaker 1: I've haven't even been there a year yet.

100
00:05:49,545 --> 00:05:50,610
Speaker 1: I've been there six months, right?

101
00:05:51,070 --> 00:05:52,676
Speaker 0: That's that's a pretty standard raise.

102
00:05:52,697 --> 00:05:53,459
Speaker 0: You should get that.

103
00:05:53,480 --> 00:06:00,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I eventually get some sort of raise You know the parking spot behind my building is only a hundred and twelve dollars a month.

104
00:06:01,071 --> 00:06:05,989
Speaker 1: So if after taxes I get a raise of a hundred and twelve dollars, that's the thing It's like by the parking space.

105
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:10,729
Speaker 0: Living in the city kind of like it sucks to have a car if you're not ultra wealthy because you got to deal with it.

106
00:06:11,231 --> 00:06:17,194
Speaker 0: But if you have the money to just pay to park the car right next to your house in New York City It's like the best thing in the world.

107
00:06:17,214 --> 00:06:22,137
Speaker 1: But here's the problem though, right if I drive say to Wildwood with it That's fine.

108
00:06:22,177 --> 00:06:23,309
Speaker 1: That's totally awesome, right?

109
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:32,906
Speaker 1: But if I drive say, you know to I don't know somewhere like on the other side of Queens Where it's sort of far away from the subway or you know, I want to

110
00:06:32,927 --> 00:06:34,492
Speaker 0: go and like yeah Well,

111
00:06:35,175 --> 00:06:44,748
Speaker 1: no, for example, right if I wanted to drive to like Target to buy like an appliance That was big and I couldn't carry it on the subway right cuz I want to bring the car with me.

112
00:06:45,751 --> 00:06:47,799
Speaker 1: Parking anywhere else sucks a big day.

113
00:06:48,382 --> 00:06:49,486
Speaker 0: Hey, I used to work in the Bronx.

114
00:06:49,727 --> 00:06:50,330
Speaker 1: We have to pay money.

115
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:50,892
Speaker 0: I'm well aware.

116
00:06:50,933 --> 00:06:56,959
Speaker 0: more than once I would drive to like a work site and then an hour later I'd call back and be like I spent an hour.

117
00:06:56,979 --> 00:06:59,830
Speaker 0: There's nowhere to park within like an hour's walk.

118
00:07:00,312 --> 00:07:01,636
Speaker 0: I'm just coming back to the office.

119
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:05,190
Speaker 1: Yeah, so here let's see some other little bit before we go.

120
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:05,874
Speaker 1: It's a movie.

121
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:08,129
Speaker 0: I'm sure people are really fascinated with all this.

122
00:07:09,192 --> 00:07:09,635
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

123
00:07:09,655 --> 00:07:16,784
Speaker 1: See it's a moving tidbits number one A tension rod really works kind of well in the bedroom didn't work.

124
00:07:16,844 --> 00:07:18,490
Speaker 1: So well, I didn't get enough.

125
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,810
Speaker 1: I didn't get a second one, which I'm glad because they didn't have one wide enough for the living room.

126
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,856
Speaker 0: So let's get to inductive them together in the middle.

127
00:07:25,619 --> 00:07:29,150
Speaker 1: They actually had a thing that lets you connect two tension rods together.

128
00:07:29,455 --> 00:07:30,348
Speaker 1: It was like a special bit.

129
00:07:30,973 --> 00:07:33,488
Speaker 1: The special bit required needs to be screwed into the wall.

130
00:07:33,548 --> 00:07:36,230
Speaker 1: pretty much There's no way to avoid screwing something into the wall.

131
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:40,290
Speaker 0: They're gonna figure out what that metal was is like a doctor what can't tell what the hell it is.

132
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:47,090
Speaker 1: I'm basically gonna find the stupor and ask him to help me out because I don't know what to do with that situation at all.

133
00:07:47,533 --> 00:07:49,129
Speaker 1: But I don't know it sucks.

134
00:07:50,312 --> 00:07:52,665
Speaker 1: But you know the tension rod is doing pretty nice in the bedroom.

135
00:07:52,926 --> 00:07:55,769
Speaker 1: So whatever What else do I get here?

136
00:07:56,811 --> 00:08:00,525
Speaker 0: The real question Scott is if the curtains match the handbag in the shoes, right?

137
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:04,109
Speaker 1: Whatever the People don't have to look at me naked anymore.

138
00:08:05,391 --> 00:08:06,857
Speaker 1: That's what the the answer is.

139
00:08:07,138 --> 00:08:17,009
Speaker 1: Um, I finally got like a hanging file cabinet right, which I've always wanted and so now I was able to sort all my papers into it instead of them being in sort of a pile in the closet.

140
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:19,797
Speaker 1: and One thing about this file cabinet.

141
00:08:20,158 --> 00:08:23,130
Speaker 1: it's from IKEA and it it was really narrow.

142
00:08:23,552 --> 00:08:26,488
Speaker 1: so I was like, huh, I've never seen a hanging file so narrow.

143
00:08:26,508 --> 00:08:29,675
Speaker 1: and So I went to Staples and about the.

144
00:08:29,896 --> 00:08:32,985
Speaker 1: they only had two sizes of hanging file letter and legal.

145
00:08:33,065 --> 00:08:34,490
Speaker 1: so I bought letter, right?

146
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,145
Speaker 1: And it wouldn't fit in the hanging file like it just would not fit in there.

147
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:42,404
Speaker 1: and I'm like what the fuck How am I supposed to use this hanging file?

148
00:08:42,544 --> 00:08:43,188
Speaker 1: It makes no sense.

149
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:59,408
Speaker 1: apparently the way this thing works is You have to take out the bottom of the drawer like remove the bottom of the drawer And then there are these two metal sticks that you slide in and you actually hang the files Sideways on the metal sticks and they hang out the bottom of the drawer.

150
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:00,770
Speaker 0: That's nowhere.

151
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,210
Speaker 1: Nowhere in the instructions did it say that you had to do that?

152
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:05,818
Speaker 1: That's exactly what you have to do.

153
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:09,116
Speaker 1: I Had to find it online though.

154
00:09:09,157 --> 00:09:10,785
Speaker 1: People are talking about it and it's actually.

155
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:11,207
Speaker 1: it's very nice.

156
00:09:11,388 --> 00:09:14,637
Speaker 1: Uh-huh What about a TV that's not here yet.

157
00:09:14,818 --> 00:09:15,259
Speaker 1: I bought it.

158
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:26,854
Speaker 1: I went to B&H which is sort of like this big fancy like pro electronics store in in behind Madison Square Garden, it's uber famous and such and It's very Jewish.

159
00:09:26,894 --> 00:09:28,320
Speaker 1: They're closed on Saturday and everything.

160
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,179
Speaker 1: and I just went to look at the TVs and The people there the you know, the TV salesman.

161
00:09:34,199 --> 00:09:37,250
Speaker 1: they weren't actually that knowledgeable, but they were you know or helpful.

162
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:39,381
Speaker 1: But at least they didn't give a shit.

163
00:09:39,401 --> 00:09:41,170
Speaker 1: So there I was like, can I change the settings on the TV?

164
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,955
Speaker 1: They're like, yeah, whatever do whatever you want.

165
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:47,270
Speaker 1: So I changed the settings on the TVs to normal to figure out you know, whatever.

166
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:52,645
Speaker 1: And I pretty much decided well the TVs that look great are too expensive.

167
00:09:52,686 --> 00:09:53,850
Speaker 1: So I would just get a normal TV.

168
00:09:54,951 --> 00:09:59,529
Speaker 1: But the thing is so I look at the normal TV with $700 the one the Samsung I was looking at.

169
00:10:00,193 --> 00:10:00,997
Speaker 1: I go on Amazon.

170
00:10:01,037 --> 00:10:01,158
Speaker 1: It's 650.

171
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:03,590
Speaker 1: So I'm like, do you have a price guarantee?

172
00:10:04,410 --> 00:10:05,333
Speaker 1: Do you have free delivery?

173
00:10:05,996 --> 00:10:10,370
Speaker 1: and they didn't have a price guarantee, but they didn't have free delivery and Amazon also had free delivery.

174
00:10:10,491 --> 00:10:11,457
Speaker 1: So I'm like, well, you know what?

175
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:12,906
Speaker 1: I'll just buy it on Amazon here.

176
00:10:12,926 --> 00:10:13,509
Speaker 0: That's the way you go.

177
00:10:13,851 --> 00:10:16,160
Speaker 0: I don't buy anything in the real world except I don't know food.

178
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:18,830
Speaker 1: So the Amazon the TV was 50 bucks less.

179
00:10:19,590 --> 00:10:20,553
Speaker 1: So it's coming.

180
00:10:20,573 --> 00:10:27,177
Speaker 0: I guess now my co-workers are buying TVs right now because they're they're all talking about the big rush as OLED becomes big.

181
00:10:27,197 --> 00:10:29,669
Speaker 0: they're like, yeah buy all the old LCDs for super cheap.

182
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:35,810
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing right is that they've got the LCDs which and then they've got the LED, right?

183
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:43,742
Speaker 1: And they're trying to trick people into thinking that LED is different from LCD like, you know But really all it is is the same TV with different lights behind it.

184
00:10:44,204 --> 00:10:46,715
Speaker 1: and LED is better, you know It's gonna be darker.

185
00:10:46,755 --> 00:10:48,564
Speaker 1: It's gonna be more in the black area.

186
00:10:48,584 --> 00:10:51,147
Speaker 1: They're gonna be more evenly lit It's gonna use less energy.

187
00:10:51,951 --> 00:10:57,204
Speaker 1: But they're charging ludicrous amounts of extra money for the LED backlit.

188
00:10:57,325 --> 00:10:58,909
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, you gotta wait on something like that.

189
00:11:00,052 --> 00:11:08,343
Speaker 1: But I mean like I have an LED backlit monitors and LED backlit You know laptop screens and they were not.

190
00:11:08,403 --> 00:11:13,060
Speaker 0: ludicrously more money Partly depends on the size and the form factor and all sorts of.

191
00:11:13,221 --> 00:11:16,532
Speaker 1: I guess yeah more bigger LEDs might be more money It's true.

192
00:11:16,813 --> 00:11:19,743
Speaker 0: but oh, well plus it's a different market different demagogue.

193
00:11:19,824 --> 00:11:21,630
Speaker 0: Everything's different with TVs than with monitors.

194
00:11:22,351 --> 00:11:25,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna save any more talk about moving stuff for later.

195
00:11:25,866 --> 00:11:26,810
Speaker 1: We don't have in minutes.

196
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:28,697
Speaker 1: There's low our whole load right away.

197
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:30,624
Speaker 0: and what a load it is.

198
00:11:30,644 --> 00:11:32,430
Speaker 0: I got this whole house to myself.

199
00:11:33,930 --> 00:11:35,564
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of quiet up here.

200
00:11:35,887 --> 00:11:36,210
Speaker 0: It's weird.

201
00:11:36,290 --> 00:11:39,830
Speaker 0: I got and I felt like my day was a lot longer because I came home from work yesterday.

202
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:41,968
Speaker 0: I'm like hanging around the house and I did like all this stuff.

203
00:11:42,896 --> 00:11:46,389
Speaker 0: No one came into our room and bothered me And eventually I went to bed.

204
00:11:47,113 --> 00:11:49,342
Speaker 1: You know, I thought that my day would feel a lot longer.

205
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:50,647
Speaker 1: and the thing is right.

206
00:11:50,727 --> 00:11:57,189
Speaker 1: number one I'm actually not saving that much time because I'm sleeping like an extra 90 minutes.

207
00:11:58,613 --> 00:12:00,106
Speaker 0: But you're getting 90 minutes more sleep.

208
00:12:00,832 --> 00:12:01,718
Speaker 1: I am but I don't.

209
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:04,656
Speaker 1: I'm not getting more time to do stuff Which is what I really wanted.

210
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:13,469
Speaker 1: and number two is after work every day I'm pretty much going around to like bed baths and beyond in other places to get house shit and sorting house stuff out.

211
00:12:14,152 --> 00:12:20,270
Speaker 1: So I'm still don't really have any much extra time to like, you know do how you know to start coding or working on projects?

212
00:12:20,350 --> 00:12:27,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, those days when I like I just stay in the city for some reasons I got some hours to kill I was like wandering around the city going like stupid just doing stupid stuff.

213
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:33,449
Speaker 1: Yep, but soon Do that Anime.

214
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:37,423
Speaker 1: So I've actually got it with that.

215
00:12:37,443 --> 00:12:38,290
Speaker 1: what the show we're doing it.

216
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:42,630
Speaker 0: I've actually got a geek bite here because you know, I keep saying oh really I also have a geek bite.

217
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,035
Speaker 0: I keep saying there's no anime news.

218
00:12:44,095 --> 00:12:49,273
Speaker 0: and then I think last time I said there's no anime news except the fact that there's no Anime news.

219
00:12:49,594 --> 00:12:50,937
Speaker 0: All I gotta say is Jesus Christ.

220
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:55,830
Speaker 0: like nothing is happening in the anime industry anymore like nothing at all.

221
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:05,395
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean there's no anime and stuff and I'm actually watching a ton of anime lately on the train But there's just there's nothing interesting happening anymore.

222
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:08,080
Speaker 0: Like there's no news other than X show came out.

223
00:13:08,911 --> 00:13:14,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wouldn't get the giant robo that you gave me, but I don't have any Speakers on this computer now.

224
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,228
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm moving them over to the TV.

225
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:17,877
Speaker 0: Don't waste John.

226
00:13:18,359 --> 00:13:28,150
Speaker 1: I moved the old TV speakers into the bedroom Which is so awesome like because I basically connected my iPod dock to the TM to those speakers in the bedroom.

227
00:13:28,792 --> 00:13:31,303
Speaker 1: It's like the alarm uses them and I got you.

228
00:13:31,805 --> 00:13:32,207
Speaker 1: it's it's.

229
00:13:32,347 --> 00:13:32,970
Speaker 1: oh it's so great.

230
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,762
Speaker 0: It's the best move but you don't want to waste giant robo.

231
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:42,647
Speaker 0: without a good sound system giant robo you know, I watched the first episode again because I showed it to Judith and Natalie when they were visiting and Emily never seen it.

232
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,616
Speaker 0: and Jesus Christ, is that show awesome?

233
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:46,278
Speaker 0: Like I just it's.

234
00:13:46,418 --> 00:13:48,745
Speaker 0: I almost forget until I watch it again.

235
00:13:48,805 --> 00:13:52,417
Speaker 0: It was like, alright that show The first time we watched it.

236
00:13:52,558 --> 00:13:53,443
Speaker 1: RIT was nuts.

237
00:13:53,604 --> 00:13:54,749
Speaker 0: We were young we didn't get it.

238
00:13:55,413 --> 00:13:58,310
Speaker 0: I know exactly what I was thinking when we saw that giant robo one.

239
00:13:58,792 --> 00:14:05,884
Speaker 0: That was that era when we always left anime club early to go hang out somewhere like as a crew Only when the show was bad even often when the show was good.

240
00:14:05,904 --> 00:14:10,590
Speaker 0: We'd be like, yeah, let's go hang out We go do stuff like we play card games or bard games or whatever.

241
00:14:11,970 --> 00:14:18,214
Speaker 0: Anyway, or but I think back then like I remember I see why I wasn't at the time in my life when I could appreciate A show like that.

242
00:14:18,696 --> 00:14:20,727
Speaker 0: I was like, yeah, it's some stupid robot fighting show.

243
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:21,209
Speaker 0: Fuck this.

244
00:14:22,292 --> 00:14:23,501
Speaker 0: Why does everyone have superpowers?

245
00:14:23,521 --> 00:14:24,448
Speaker 0: that doesn't make any sense?

246
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:27,033
Speaker 0: Now it's like.

247
00:14:27,053 --> 00:14:28,799
Speaker 0: I mean, I guess I'm just a Hokuto.

248
00:14:28,819 --> 00:14:32,189
Speaker 0: no Ken fix that everyone has super powers in that show.

249
00:14:33,691 --> 00:14:38,951
Speaker 0: But I'm watching of all things right now and I said I was watching it before and then I stopped and I'm almost done with it.

250
00:14:38,991 --> 00:14:44,202
Speaker 0: Tetsuwan birdie decode the Remake of the original Tetsuwan birdie aka.

251
00:14:44,283 --> 00:14:45,267
Speaker 1: It's a remake.

252
00:14:45,307 --> 00:14:47,633
Speaker 1: It's not a sequel It's dead.

253
00:14:47,653 --> 00:14:47,954
Speaker 0: Yes.

254
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:51,910
Speaker 0: I mean I've not seen more than like one episode of the original birdie the mighty.

255
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,058
Speaker 0: It definitely feels like a complete remake.

256
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:58,114
Speaker 1: so you can watch this show knowing nothing about Absolutely, nothing.

257
00:14:58,154 --> 00:15:02,469
Speaker 0: The only thing you will not get are some clever homage to the original show.

258
00:15:03,292 --> 00:15:05,359
Speaker 1: Okay, so it's not it's not it's not.

259
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,285
Speaker 1: there's no story connection.

260
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:12,700
Speaker 1: You find out on your own episode 174 of spider-man without reading one through 173.

261
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:23,748
Speaker 0: No, it's basically just oh shit It's birdie the mighty aka birdie the berserker killer and she punches some kid and then he dies and she has to die share the body and all that stuff.

262
00:15:23,808 --> 00:15:28,090
Speaker 0: and I like this show a lot more than I expected.

263
00:15:28,191 --> 00:15:31,228
Speaker 0: I thought it'd be so dumb, but I watched the first episode with Emily and it was just it.

264
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,300
Speaker 0: Harken back to a different era of anime.

265
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:34,460
Speaker 0: Like.

266
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:42,395
Speaker 0: I felt like it was 1996 again In a good way like it was a dumb show, but it wasn't dumb like dumb anime I watch now.

267
00:15:42,817 --> 00:15:49,910
Speaker 0: it was dumb like dumb 90s anime Like it was just kind of like high flying space comedy action and just I don't know.

268
00:15:49,930 --> 00:15:54,125
Speaker 1: There's a lot going on in this show and watching the show on crunchyroll or somewhere else or what?

269
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,639
Speaker 0: I got a Pirated copy.

270
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:58,110
Speaker 0: I'm watching on the train.

271
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:01,504
Speaker 1: Maybe it leave you legally available.

272
00:16:01,605 --> 00:16:02,449
Speaker 0: I have no idea.

273
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:06,102
Speaker 0: At this point, I don't unless something's on crunchyroll.

274
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:11,442
Speaker 0: if it came out after like 2007 I don't have any faith that there's any legal way to get it.

275
00:16:11,502 --> 00:16:13,230
Speaker 0: I just don't even know what's on DVD anymore.

276
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,160
Speaker 1: I think claim word is coming out on DVD right now.

277
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,481
Speaker 1: Huh?

278
00:16:16,962 --> 00:16:17,163
Speaker 0: I could.

279
00:16:17,223 --> 00:16:19,190
Speaker 0: I was a show that was good enough to finish?

280
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,758
Speaker 0: I think I don't know.

281
00:16:20,778 --> 00:16:23,010
Speaker 1: It's good enough to at least continue watching before I left off.

282
00:16:23,251 --> 00:16:26,483
Speaker 1: Yeah, I actually you know, it's that's one of those ones where it's like.

283
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:28,390
Speaker 1: should I go and finish watching that anime?

284
00:16:28,710 --> 00:16:32,390
Speaker 0: If there's any show that manga if there's any show that we have the you know.

285
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:35,690
Speaker 0: We started watching it and we stopped for no reason other than we stopped.

286
00:16:36,173 --> 00:16:38,489
Speaker 0: We got to watch the rest of ergo proxy because that was a show.

287
00:16:38,851 --> 00:16:45,621
Speaker 1: That was the show that I was coming into my mind just as you were talking about stopping watching a show Because we didn't stop for any reason.

288
00:16:45,661 --> 00:16:48,054
Speaker 0: In fact, the show is just getting to the point We're like, oh shit.

289
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,100
Speaker 0: This might be a good show.

290
00:16:49,301 --> 00:16:53,048
Speaker 1: the one thing about the ergo proxy those I know what Darryl Surratt said about.

291
00:16:53,128 --> 00:16:54,554
Speaker 1: you know the leader parts and such.

292
00:16:54,695 --> 00:17:02,349
Speaker 1: but the thing is the show started with that cool cyberpunk city and then it switched to sort of Outside the city business, but then we was just getting back into the city.

293
00:17:02,912 --> 00:17:04,618
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but I mean I like this.

294
00:17:04,659 --> 00:17:07,249
Speaker 1: I wish it was the cyberpunk stuff the whole time.

295
00:17:08,516 --> 00:17:10,970
Speaker 1: It would have been much closer to a ghost shell kind of thing.

296
00:17:11,111 --> 00:17:20,130
Speaker 0: I think the weird thing about the show is that with the aesthetic and like the first couple episodes It looked really kind of I hate to use the word pretentious, but it seemed like this pretentious garbage.

297
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,281
Speaker 0: And then suddenly it's like oh wait, it's not doing that.

298
00:17:23,321 --> 00:17:25,470
Speaker 0: It's using uh, and then it went outside.

299
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:27,457
Speaker 0: It's like oh it's doing something different entirely.

300
00:17:27,477 --> 00:17:34,267
Speaker 0: and then having not seen the rest but having listened to Darryl Surratt's review Everything he said tells me that it's a show.

301
00:17:34,327 --> 00:17:36,195
Speaker 0: I like Yeah, probably.

302
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,363
Speaker 0: so we got.

303
00:17:37,383 --> 00:17:38,490
Speaker 0: we got to watch that and review it.

304
00:17:39,531 --> 00:17:42,949
Speaker 1: Alright, so I'm gonna actually do a geek bite on a comic book.

305
00:17:44,374 --> 00:17:46,953
Speaker 1: You know what kind of book it is Pax Romana?

306
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:48,819
Speaker 1: No, that's what we're doing the whole show.

307
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:51,449
Speaker 0: I know but you could totally steal all of our thunder with that.

308
00:17:52,231 --> 00:17:54,418
Speaker 1: Steal my own thunder from myself.

309
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,086
Speaker 1: I stole a dollar from my own wallet.

310
00:17:57,668 --> 00:18:01,328
Speaker 1: Ah, okay The only comic that I really since.

311
00:18:01,348 --> 00:18:04,964
Speaker 1: you know I couldn't really bring my books with me yet because they are too heavy and such.

312
00:18:05,165 --> 00:18:09,582
Speaker 1: I have to find some way to get them down here later Perhaps slowly and over time.

313
00:18:09,603 --> 00:18:11,575
Speaker 1: I Brought down.

314
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:17,329
Speaker 1: I'm trying to read everything that I've borrowed from anybody, you know Because that way I can give them back and not have to move them.

315
00:18:18,571 --> 00:18:20,729
Speaker 1: People give me back things I lent to them.

316
00:18:20,870 --> 00:18:24,169
Speaker 0: Yeah, speaking of which you ever get Eagle back from the comic geek speed guys.

317
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:27,343
Speaker 1: No, I will probably get it back at like the New York Comic Con.

318
00:18:27,363 --> 00:18:28,730
Speaker 0: All right, cuz I want it back.

319
00:18:28,830 --> 00:18:30,438
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I want to lend it to someone.

320
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:36,768
Speaker 1: Yeah, we could have gotten it back at What's it called the if we went to their convention.

321
00:18:36,788 --> 00:18:37,110
Speaker 1: the thing?

322
00:18:37,471 --> 00:18:38,395
Speaker 0: Wanted to go to that.

323
00:18:38,978 --> 00:18:41,709
Speaker 1: their convention is the same day as PAX East.

324
00:18:41,809 --> 00:18:43,606
Speaker 0: so I can't happen.

325
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:51,419
Speaker 0: No So well at the New York Comic Con which I guess is see that the you own the vast majority of the comics and manga In the front row crew like right here though.

326
00:18:51,459 --> 00:18:53,650
Speaker 0: Lara has pretty much all the manga that you don't know.

327
00:18:54,372 --> 00:19:04,003
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much but I'm very happy that I am the owner of sanctuary at Eagle like I feel like those two are worth if it weren't for Urasawa.

328
00:19:04,023 --> 00:19:09,557
Speaker 0: those two are worth more than like your entire collection, but Urasawa Damn, you know by it.

329
00:19:10,179 --> 00:19:14,313
Speaker 1: Yeah, Scott's boxes are being delivered here now, by the way, so Very nice.

330
00:19:14,394 --> 00:19:17,330
Speaker 1: Anyway, no, so I was you know, I also I want to you know.

331
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:23,112
Speaker 1: Okay, if I'm moving I want to get stuff sorted out between who I lent what and who lent what to me and all that Kind of stuff.

332
00:19:23,776 --> 00:19:26,670
Speaker 1: so so it doesn't get lost, you know in the moving process.

333
00:19:27,471 --> 00:19:35,509
Speaker 0: So I started reading Alex's Alan Moore Swamp Thing volumes That was laying under the piano forever and I while I've kept forgetting whose it was.

334
00:19:36,353 --> 00:19:38,222
Speaker 0: Yeah, who's is this now?

335
00:19:38,322 --> 00:19:39,146
Speaker 0: It's like it's mine.

336
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:39,950
Speaker 0: I lent it to Scott.

337
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:41,554
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've read.

338
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:43,703
Speaker 1: I've read like two volumes so far.

339
00:19:43,904 --> 00:19:44,687
Speaker 1: Maybe three.

340
00:19:44,707 --> 00:19:45,370
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

341
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,009
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

342
00:19:48,211 --> 00:19:49,605
Speaker 1: I mean the first.

343
00:19:49,908 --> 00:20:07,229
Speaker 1: you know The first issue in the first volume has it's sort of like Sandman in a way in that You know in like the first volume of Sandman It was like a little superhero II, you know and the Swamp Thing like the first issue actually has like the Justice League in it You know, they don't really do anything but they're just they're there there they are, right?

344
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:11,063
Speaker 1: So it's a little bit super hero II and then it sort of gets away from that.

345
00:20:11,184 --> 00:20:19,390
Speaker 1: and the thing is some of the issues It's you know has like this very heavy-handed Environmental message like this one issue that's like nuclear bad.

346
00:20:20,911 --> 00:20:28,390
Speaker 1: It's all about like this guy nuke face who's like horribly deformed from drinking like radioactive materials and that he shouldn't have done that.

347
00:20:29,112 --> 00:20:30,496
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's you know, it's it's.

348
00:20:30,898 --> 00:20:34,690
Speaker 1: it's also has like people dumping toxic waste into the swamp, you know and stuff.

349
00:20:34,851 --> 00:20:37,410
Speaker 1: And it's like, you know, obviously that's bad.

350
00:20:37,591 --> 00:20:45,710
Speaker 1: But like, you know, it's a very anti nuclear power issue and you know I think it would have worked a lot better if I didn't know that nuclear power was totally awesome.

351
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:54,370
Speaker 1: But you know and other parts of it, you know, or you know, it's really interesting Like I didn't know like what Swamp Thing was like.

352
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:58,209
Speaker 1: I knew he was a green guy from the swamp and that was pretty much it.

353
00:20:58,792 --> 00:21:07,930
Speaker 1: Like knowing what Swamp Thing actually is, you know And it actually Swamp Thing was something different and then Alan Moore changed what it was in this one issue.

354
00:21:08,010 --> 00:21:10,261
Speaker 1: That's like the lauded great issue.

355
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:14,194
Speaker 1: I think it's called like Anatomy lesson and It was actually.

356
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,498
Speaker 1: it's pretty fantastic.

357
00:21:15,559 --> 00:21:20,757
Speaker 1: I mean, it's you know, it's Alan Moore quality writing, you know And the art is actually really great.

358
00:21:20,797 --> 00:21:24,673
Speaker 1: the colors actually you think like the whole thing will be like black and green But it's not.

359
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:28,730
Speaker 1: there's actually a whole ton of color like all over and it really like stands out.

360
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:32,029
Speaker 1: It's like the art is as good as the art that on fables right now.

361
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:42,685
Speaker 1: So even though this thing is wicked old on a scale of make it old I mean, I think it's 80s old on a scale of say Watchmen to Batman Dark Knight Returns.

362
00:21:42,745 --> 00:21:43,490
Speaker 0: Where does it lie?

363
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:47,559
Speaker 1: Below both of them, but it's you know, it's still up there.

364
00:21:47,619 --> 00:21:48,963
Speaker 1: I mean, it's.

365
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,149
Speaker 1: I say it's it's prime mouse guard.

366
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:54,484
Speaker 0: good You have to read it and then we can review it straight up.

367
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:55,830
Speaker 1: Yeah, probably

368
00:21:57,294 --> 00:22:12,145
Speaker 0: I'll recommend conversely at some point It'd be worth your while to watch birdie the mighty at least a couple episodes to see Because the show would be dumb except that all the action in it is very like old-school anime action But not old old-school like old-school 90s old school.

369
00:22:13,993 --> 00:22:15,176
Speaker 0: There are so many schools now.

370
00:22:15,216 --> 00:22:15,698
Speaker 0: It's crazy.

371
00:22:15,738 --> 00:22:28,871
Speaker 0: Like some people old-school is Star Blazers and some people old-school is like Giant robo or Tetsu on birdie, but giant robo is old-school homage to an older school Incredibly old-school.

372
00:22:29,011 --> 00:22:29,272
Speaker 1: All right.

373
00:22:29,352 --> 00:22:39,440
Speaker 0: Anyway, but anyway moving this along it's time for things of the day.

374
00:22:40,021 --> 00:22:45,580
Speaker 0: So according to FARC anvil shooting is a grand American tradition and it is literally.

375
00:22:46,141 --> 00:22:51,955
Speaker 1: If you shoot at anvils or you shoot anvil you shoot anvils and anvils are the ammunition.

376
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:54,340
Speaker 0: you shoot anvils at anvils with anvils.

377
00:22:55,441 --> 00:22:57,949
Speaker 1: Wait, you can't have three anvils in.

378
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:58,772
Speaker 0: so here's what you do.

379
00:22:58,993 --> 00:23:07,275
Speaker 0: You take one anvil you put it on the ground Upside down you put gunpowder in the hole in the bottom of the anvil.

380
00:23:07,896 --> 00:23:09,160
Speaker 1: you put a hole in the anvil.

381
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,545
Speaker 0: There's a hole on the bottom of an anvil.

382
00:23:11,268 --> 00:23:13,456
Speaker 0: really that's like where you mount the anvil on something.

383
00:23:14,299 --> 00:23:15,282
Speaker 1: Oh, okay I see what you're saying.

384
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:16,726
Speaker 0: It's like a big slot down there.

385
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:21,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then on top of that you put another identical anvil.

386
00:23:22,281 --> 00:23:25,480
Speaker 0: Okay, and then you blow it up and that anvil goes higher.

387
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:32,327
Speaker 0: It's so high that you cannot see it and it comes back down Almost exactly where you shot it.

388
00:23:32,387 --> 00:23:38,398
Speaker 0: Sometimes it'll hit the anvil from which you launched it and Then you have to freakin run the hell away.

389
00:23:38,828 --> 00:23:39,200
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

390
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:46,295
Speaker 0: the video is basically he lights it and you expect you know watching myth busters or all the kind of Professional and semi-professional people doing stuff like this.

391
00:23:46,315 --> 00:23:49,940
Speaker 0: I Expected there to be like this long fuse or something electronic.

392
00:23:50,422 --> 00:23:51,246
Speaker 0: He likes the fuse.

393
00:23:51,648 --> 00:23:54,040
Speaker 0: It's sticking like an inch out of that anvil.

394
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,545
Speaker 0: Motherfucker runs, let me tell you.

395
00:23:58,565 --> 00:24:00,892
Speaker 1: Oh, he did run far away.

396
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:03,160
Speaker 0: No, he likes it and it's like a light light light light light run.

397
00:24:05,202 --> 00:24:10,920
Speaker 1: So like if a guy ran like let's say you ran like you just didn't stop running and the landfill got him any lady.

398
00:24:11,181 --> 00:24:18,709
Speaker 1: And then he ran immediately as soon as it was lit and never stopped and then the anvil happened to land on top of him Wherever you got to.

399
00:24:19,112 --> 00:24:20,480
Speaker 0: the image of that is kind of funny.

400
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,988
Speaker 1: But apparently why the coyote moment right there?

401
00:24:23,028 --> 00:24:26,178
Speaker 0: apparently the anvils tend to fall almost exactly where they went up.

402
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:31,475
Speaker 0: because you know Winds now pushing an anvil so much, you know, it'd be badass though.

403
00:24:31,515 --> 00:24:40,560
Speaker 1: If you if you like could Calculate and be really precise with your anvil and hit an anvil in the air with another anvil No, but that's an even better idea.

404
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:45,056
Speaker 1: But no like if you got the if you knew the anvil was gonna land exactly where it took off from.

405
00:24:45,076 --> 00:24:47,219
Speaker 0: have another anvil shoot Up just as that one lands.

406
00:24:47,614 --> 00:24:53,647
Speaker 1: No You you lit it and you just stood right next to it and it landed like right in front of you and you were just like Yeah, fuck that.

407
00:24:53,808 --> 00:24:54,895
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm awesome.

408
00:24:54,915 --> 00:24:58,668
Speaker 1: Yeah I Just stood right here.

409
00:24:58,729 --> 00:25:02,149
Speaker 1: this anvil could have landed on my head But it landed one foot in front of me and I was

410
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:08,659
Speaker 0: like the old physics thing where you take a bowling ball On a string hanging from the ceiling and you hold it next to your nose and you let go and you just stand there.

411
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:19,054
Speaker 0: Yeah, however, all that reminds me of is we were talking about electron microscopes and physics in like 10th grade And I remember he the professor part of the teacher.

412
00:25:19,114 --> 00:25:33,339
Speaker 0: I guess it was high school pointed out You were talking about why electron microscopes work that a far more accurate Man microscope would be a bowling ball microscope that just fired millions of bowling balls at near the speed of light at an object.

413
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:34,905
Speaker 1: Too bad.

414
00:25:34,925 --> 00:25:36,879
Speaker 1: We can't fire the bowling balls with the speed of light.

415
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,788
Speaker 0: Well near the speed of light not at the speed of light.

416
00:25:38,848 --> 00:25:41,279
Speaker 1: and the other problem is the bowling balls will hit each other.

417
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,383
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah electrons do the same thing.

418
00:25:43,443 --> 00:25:48,069
Speaker 0: electrons electron microscopes many kinds of them basically destroy whatever they're looking at.

419
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:49,863
Speaker 1: I Know that.

420
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:52,176
Speaker 1: that's why you can't take pictures of like live things.

421
00:25:52,236 --> 00:25:52,900
Speaker 1: They always die.

422
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,440
Speaker 1: There are some cool techniques to take usually kill them like when they're setting them up for it to go in the mega.

423
00:25:57,721 --> 00:26:03,862
Speaker 0: There are some weird cool techniques to take images of living things with electron microscopes Really?

424
00:26:04,123 --> 00:26:08,076
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know much more about it than that has maybe a scientist and show will type in.

425
00:26:08,156 --> 00:26:16,334
Speaker 1: but my thing of the Day is not the greatest thing of the day in the universe But it is following a long tradition of Soviet things of the day.

426
00:26:16,775 --> 00:26:19,323
Speaker 0: Those were the days my friend We thought they'd never end.

427
00:26:19,764 --> 00:26:19,985
Speaker 1: Yes.

428
00:26:20,486 --> 00:26:22,912
Speaker 1: This is basically a bunch of anti u.s.

429
00:26:23,313 --> 00:26:24,597
Speaker 1: Soviet propaganda.

430
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,820
Speaker 0: I love stuff like that.

431
00:26:26,769 --> 00:26:29,619
Speaker 1: Yeah It's you know, it's just a simple webpage.

432
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,680
Speaker 1: It's got pictures of you know fat cats with top hats being carried around by.

433
00:26:34,763 --> 00:26:37,953
Speaker 0: The reason I like so much Soviet propaganda is that one.

434
00:26:37,973 --> 00:26:53,776
Speaker 0: it uses this really cool style Like the very star and a lot of different styles going on here actually but to the message like the raw message independently of the kind of reality of communism is You know the workers rising up and taking back.

435
00:26:53,836 --> 00:26:54,640
Speaker 0: What's theirs?

436
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:55,606
Speaker 0: You know the blood.

437
00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:57,600
Speaker 1: actually most of these most of these images.

438
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:06,059
Speaker 1: I mean there's a little bit of that but most of these images are like Americans evil bombs Soviets good babies.

439
00:27:08,621 --> 00:27:21,071
Speaker 1: Like one of these pictures right show the loaf of bread and then it shows like a combat knife and the combat knife is chopping the loaf of bread right and each slice of bread is sort of falling off and turning into bombs.

440
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:23,482
Speaker 1: and It's right.

441
00:27:23,883 --> 00:27:25,348
Speaker 1: It's trying to say that the u.s.

442
00:27:25,529 --> 00:27:26,954
Speaker 1: You know turns food into bombs.

443
00:27:27,596 --> 00:27:28,619
Speaker 0: We kind of did back then.

444
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:37,000
Speaker 0: I know I mean not that communism was great But I can see the word rest of the world having that image of us and not feeling too unjustified.

445
00:27:37,401 --> 00:27:42,199
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think the translation is humanitarian help to starving ones in American way.

446
00:27:46,083 --> 00:27:46,566
Speaker 0: You see that.

447
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:50,806
Speaker 0: you know, that's what really does it the Communist stuff like that.

448
00:27:50,927 --> 00:27:53,614
Speaker 0: That's kind of funny and clever and well thought out.

449
00:27:53,634 --> 00:27:57,386
Speaker 0: I mean look at the propaganda We drop over like Afghanistan.

450
00:27:57,747 --> 00:27:59,211
Speaker 0: It's it's kind of sad.

451
00:27:59,291 --> 00:28:01,960
Speaker 0: It's not really biting or satirical or anything.

452
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:02,945
Speaker 1: Yep.

453
00:28:03,630 --> 00:28:04,072
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

454
00:28:04,092 --> 00:28:06,582
Speaker 1: These are these are funny and Interesting.

455
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:08,869
Speaker 0: So holy shit.

456
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:10,333
Speaker 0: I read a comic.

457
00:28:11,196 --> 00:28:11,798
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

458
00:28:11,818 --> 00:28:12,560
Speaker 1: He wrote a comic.

459
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,247
Speaker 0: You know, I did write a comic.

460
00:28:14,348 --> 00:28:17,080
Speaker 1: art of the word had part of the word Rome in the title.

461
00:28:17,161 --> 00:28:17,931
Speaker 1: That's why he read it.

462
00:28:18,437 --> 00:28:20,063
Speaker 0: Yeah well basically I was like Scott.

463
00:28:20,505 --> 00:28:24,801
Speaker 0: we got to do an anime and a comic in the next two Wednesday shows to kind of get back on Track.

464
00:28:25,384 --> 00:28:29,180
Speaker 0: and I was like, you're not gonna watch an anime in time for the next show.

465
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:31,167
Speaker 0: So give me a short comic to read.

466
00:28:31,488 --> 00:28:33,956
Speaker 0: and Scott's like I got one that ups that's up your alley.

467
00:28:34,137 --> 00:28:37,354
Speaker 0: It's got the word Rome in the title.

468
00:28:39,081 --> 00:28:41,358
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I was like, well, you know this.

469
00:28:42,742 --> 00:28:46,080
Speaker 1: You know, it's not greatest comic ever in the history of the world.

470
00:28:46,261 --> 00:28:50,160
Speaker 1: But I know that rim will enjoy anything that involves a Rome.

471
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,009
Speaker 1: But of course it was not me.

472
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:53,980
Speaker 1: and what did you expect when you saw like the cover?

473
00:28:54,321 --> 00:28:57,596
Speaker 0: All right, when I saw the cover I expected here.

474
00:28:57,636 --> 00:29:06,800
Speaker 0: My expectation was one This is a comic about what if the Roman Empire did not fall and continued if forever just without falling.

475
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:17,679
Speaker 0: So now we're at like the year 1999 or 2000 or whatever and there's just the Roman fucking Empire with modern stuff and it was kind of that but not really.

476
00:29:19,601 --> 00:29:25,139
Speaker 0: It kind of was in a way but in a. I was right in that the Roman Empire didn't fucking fall.

477
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:30,700
Speaker 1: The comic is by is written by Jonathan Hickman.

478
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:31,845
Speaker 1: Yes, the guy wrote his.

479
00:29:31,885 --> 00:29:33,472
Speaker 1: we wrote nightly news, which is it.

480
00:29:33,552 --> 00:29:34,918
Speaker 1: we did a show on that way back.

481
00:29:34,978 --> 00:29:38,618
Speaker 1: Yeah What's it called?

482
00:29:39,521 --> 00:29:46,936
Speaker 0: Scott told me hey, by the way, it's by Jonathan Hickman, you know the nightly news guy and I'm like Yeah, and then I forgot about that and I was reading it again.

483
00:29:46,956 --> 00:29:47,700
Speaker 0: I didn't look at the cover.

484
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,925
Speaker 0: I'm like, huh?

485
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:49,487
Speaker 0: This is now.

486
00:29:49,507 --> 00:29:51,816
Speaker 0: look at the front like da Jonathan Hickman.

487
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:55,568
Speaker 1: Yep What was the other one that he did?

488
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:56,272
Speaker 1: I can't believe.

489
00:29:56,312 --> 00:29:56,735
Speaker 1: I can't remember.

490
00:29:56,775 --> 00:30:02,374
Speaker 1: he's working at Marvel now actually writing on stuff like Fantastic Four and such.

491
00:30:02,655 --> 00:30:03,900
Speaker 1: it's really interesting.

492
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:06,680
Speaker 0: But anyway, I want to point out we're gonna review this.

493
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:12,480
Speaker 0: We're not gonna spoil it other than we kind of have to describe the plot which is a regular human.

494
00:30:12,701 --> 00:30:16,000
Speaker 1: He wrote transhuman and he'd also did a red mask for Mars.

495
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:22,639
Speaker 1: There was actually a reference to red mask for Mars at the end of Pax Romana.

496
00:30:23,487 --> 00:30:25,662
Speaker 0: No, cuz I didn't read that yet Okay.

497
00:30:26,203 --> 00:30:32,800
Speaker 0: Anyway, though, we're not gonna spoil this other than we have to spoil the premise because otherwise you can't review a one-off comic.

498
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:34,484
Speaker 1: Well, it's not really.

499
00:30:34,525 --> 00:30:36,935
Speaker 1: I mean it's a one-off in the sense that it won't trade.

500
00:30:36,955 --> 00:30:38,080
Speaker 1: paperback is the whole thing.

501
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:42,413
Speaker 1: But I think it's actually like three to five issues six issues something like that.

502
00:30:42,493 --> 00:30:53,498
Speaker 0: But it's a really short-contained story and Part of a spoiler is simply knowing what the story actually is because it starts out kind of Slightly different from where you'd expect it to start.

503
00:30:54,021 --> 00:31:06,658
Speaker 1: Well, it's also really interesting how they at the end they sort of rushed the end like they didn't, you know It's like you have this big story, but they really only Fleshed out certain short scenes in the story, but at the same

504
00:31:06,719 --> 00:31:10,740
Speaker 0: time I like that because one it definitely pulled a little bit of an Ava.

505
00:31:10,840 --> 00:31:16,720
Speaker 0: It's like seriously if you think that anything matters other than like the the numbers of what happened.

506
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:27,399
Speaker 0: It's kind of like when you look at a lot of old comic books the numbers like by the numbers of what happened like this war then this then this then this a description of the plot Often seems really cool.

507
00:31:27,741 --> 00:31:32,580
Speaker 0: But then you read the old comic and it's just I punch you you a little guy and all this bullshit.

508
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,849
Speaker 0: You don't care about you always.

509
00:31:34,111 --> 00:31:37,326
Speaker 1: you need a new example of old Example of old comic books.

510
00:31:37,487 --> 00:31:38,954
Speaker 0: I've hit you now you little guy.

511
00:31:39,075 --> 00:31:40,080
Speaker 0: Oh, no, he's hitting me.

512
00:31:42,881 --> 00:31:46,594
Speaker 1: But yeah, but this this is a comic that doesn't really tell you a lot of.

513
00:31:46,614 --> 00:31:51,109
Speaker 1: I mean there's like human drama and stuff But it only gives you like the high-level details.

514
00:31:51,149 --> 00:31:59,860
Speaker 1: It's like this huge gigantic, you know, you know Earth Universe spanning story and you're just getting a bird's-eye view of the whole thing.

515
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,191
Speaker 1: You're not getting a lot of details of.

516
00:32:02,231 --> 00:32:02,392
Speaker 1: this.

517
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:06,773
Speaker 1: person said this, you know There's very little really really like that.

518
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:29,300
Speaker 0: as a result because one Stories like this can almost fall into the trap of minutiae where like say you get to a point where you know Person a is totally going to betray person B and then like do something and you know it's coming and then you've got to read like the next 40 pages of it actually happening and Kind of you're like maybe interesting stuff happens.

519
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,722
Speaker 0: It might be portrayed well and whatever but at the same time there's this little part of you That's like.

520
00:32:33,205 --> 00:32:34,272
Speaker 0: I know this is gonna happen.

521
00:32:34,292 --> 00:32:35,499
Speaker 0: I want to know what happens next.

522
00:32:37,562 --> 00:32:39,649
Speaker 1: Yes, you're the kind of person doesn't like a cliffhanger.

523
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:43,817
Speaker 1: this is pretty great because it just rushes you straight through You know from beginning to end.

524
00:32:43,837 --> 00:32:48,914
Speaker 1: well Especially the point because at the end at the very end there is sort of a revelation.

525
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:55,214
Speaker 1: Oh shit, you know, yeah Well, it's also that there's also a mini revelation in like the early on.

526
00:32:55,254 --> 00:32:56,277
Speaker 1: but that was sort of obvious.

527
00:32:56,719 --> 00:32:58,764
Speaker 0: Yeah But it's it's sort.

528
00:32:58,804 --> 00:32:59,527
Speaker 0: there's so many good.

529
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:03,361
Speaker 0: but basically the premise before we get any further because obviously no one has read this He's not.

530
00:33:03,401 --> 00:33:10,500
Speaker 0: many of you probably read it is that nobody in the far ish future of the modern real world.

531
00:33:11,049 --> 00:33:11,539
Speaker 1: This is the gene.

532
00:33:13,782 --> 00:33:24,938
Speaker 0: Alright if you want no other reason to read this there is a gene Pope a genetic Pope an amalgamation of a thousand holy men and he is kind of a prick but also a badass.

533
00:33:25,058 --> 00:33:29,658
Speaker 0: and if You can just stop listening right now and buy this if you think that sounds cool.

534
00:33:31,834 --> 00:33:38,546
Speaker 0: But The real pull of the story is basically that we've got you know, it's the our future Catholicism not doing so.

535
00:33:38,586 --> 00:33:46,024
Speaker 0: well Islam is spread all over the place and you know science basically made religion kind of stupid and Obsolete and all that sort of stuff.

536
00:33:46,064 --> 00:33:53,267
Speaker 0: but the Vatican had a secret science program to develop time travel and it works And it really was shit.

537
00:33:53,347 --> 00:33:54,211
Speaker 1: It actually worked.

538
00:33:54,271 --> 00:33:54,532
Speaker 1: like.

539
00:33:54,974 --> 00:34:04,478
Speaker 0: I love those scientists who were like Yeah, we did it check it out we sent a rat back in time a little bit and then the Pope the Vatican's like Alright, let's do this.

540
00:34:04,941 --> 00:34:09,273
Speaker 0: So they gather all these holy people and an army and they do.

541
00:34:09,313 --> 00:34:18,399
Speaker 0: there's this all this whole build-up where they debate like Where do they go back in time to ensure that Catholicism is stronger now than it is currently like?

542
00:34:18,418 --> 00:34:23,760
Speaker 0: basically This is want to make Rome now fall and make Christianity and Catholicism remain strong and power.

543
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:30,603
Speaker 1: And it's really if the discussion they have of like even should they go back in time to when to do what you know It's very interesting.

544
00:34:30,623 --> 00:34:34,396
Speaker 1: Like they're like, well, we cannot absolutely not go back before the time of Jesus.

545
00:34:34,436 --> 00:34:35,460
Speaker 1: That would not be allowed.

546
00:34:35,701 --> 00:34:37,005
Speaker 0: You know, it's like it's cool.

547
00:34:37,065 --> 00:34:38,007
Speaker 1: I would all.

548
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:44,393
Speaker 0: the every character every single character in this is Smart at least as smart as you the reader.

549
00:34:44,414 --> 00:34:50,699
Speaker 0: So the intellectual discussions and arguments they have which it kind of does these cool decides where you'll get that like.

550
00:34:51,241 --> 00:34:51,562
Speaker 0: It'll like.

551
00:34:51,581 --> 00:34:57,320
Speaker 0: you'll see a scene and then it cuts to the following is the transcript recorded by such-and-such on such-and-such date.

552
00:34:57,721 --> 00:35:03,614
Speaker 1: And usually, you know, usually when you're reading a comic book and they break in with a bunch of text, you know it's sort of like.

553
00:35:04,542 --> 00:35:15,320
Speaker 1: You know, obviously, you know, I don't have a problem reading a novel but when you encounter that there's something in your brain It's like your brain doesn't like switching from like picture and text mode to pure text mode.

554
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:21,785
Speaker 0: Look at how many people who otherwise understand comics just skip over all the words and watchman stupidly Right.

555
00:35:21,886 --> 00:35:24,342
Speaker 1: So the thing is in this book Like.

556
00:35:24,382 --> 00:35:28,041
Speaker 1: I actually didn't have that problem like when I got to the text parts I like.

557
00:35:28,061 --> 00:35:28,945
Speaker 1: I just kept going.

558
00:35:28,985 --> 00:35:32,940
Speaker 1: I didn't feel that thing and even in Watchmen I read the stuff anyway.

559
00:35:33,102 --> 00:35:34,779
Speaker 1: But it's like it takes that to switch my brain.

560
00:35:35,002 --> 00:35:36,055
Speaker 1: I didn't have to switch this.

561
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:46,669
Speaker 1: Something about the way he laid it out or the amount of text or something maybe because it's still dialogue text like comics Yeah And also just being a solid block of pros on a raw level.

562
00:35:47,451 --> 00:35:56,320
Speaker 0: the actual real arguments that these characters are having Are the same kind of arguments we would have in the crew if such a thing were possible like they did.

563
00:35:56,581 --> 00:36:01,780
Speaker 1: They're very dirty arguments, you know, but that's you know, theological arguments usually are that way.

564
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,499
Speaker 1: But these are other arguments that are not theological in nature.

565
00:36:06,321 --> 00:36:24,460
Speaker 0: So basically they decide to go back the best time to change everything to where Constantine is about to basically make Christianity the the religion of Rome and their goal is to kind of prevent the schism and Create a society that will not fall and kind of fix Rome and that sort of thing.

566
00:36:25,623 --> 00:36:30,329
Speaker 0: And of course it all goes haywire But not necessarily for the reasons you expect.

567
00:36:30,389 --> 00:36:36,006
Speaker 0: it goes haywire a lot quicker than you would have expected Pretty much immediately.

568
00:36:36,066 --> 00:36:38,880
Speaker 1: I like how Constantine like the way they portray Constantine.

569
00:36:39,021 --> 00:36:43,980
Speaker 1: Oh, that was the best scene where like he knows like he knows what's up, you know, he's not a moron.

570
00:36:44,742 --> 00:36:59,074
Speaker 0: Well, that's the thing when they kind of the main dude sneaks up on him and Constantine's all cool and then he's like he says something insightful to Constantine like a da da da da and Constantine gives this really clever answer and then the guy's like shit man.

571
00:36:59,094 --> 00:37:00,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought I thought you would be simple.

572
00:37:01,841 --> 00:37:16,814
Speaker 1: Yeah, you thought the people in the olden times would be like cavemen, but no You know even even in the olden times to be Emperor like they you got to be on the ball or crazy or lucky Yep, but Constantine was not the the Nero.

573
00:37:16,834 --> 00:37:18,139
Speaker 0: There's also this great scene where?

574
00:37:18,381 --> 00:37:25,380
Speaker 0: Constantine's like all right I've had enough with you and he calls his all these guards like four big burly guards with you know weapons.

575
00:37:25,521 --> 00:37:28,257
Speaker 0: He's like take this guy away and crucify him or something.

576
00:37:28,298 --> 00:37:28,660
Speaker 0: I don't care.

577
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:36,160
Speaker 1: I have a feeling I would be willing to bet a small amount of money that Jonathan Hickman was listening to 12 Byzantine emperors.

578
00:37:37,963 --> 00:37:45,600
Speaker 1: You see a lot of that stuff where it's like, yep Is he gonna let the idiot son become king or is he going to appoint the guy who actually could be good at being?

579
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:49,319
Speaker 0: An idiot son ruins everything always.

580
00:37:50,122 --> 00:37:55,660
Speaker 1: There's also that stuff where like they know what the they know what the original history was gonna be.

581
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:59,680
Speaker 1: So they're sort of trying to figure out like well, we know that this person was a traitorous asshole.

582
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:00,844
Speaker 1: What should we do about them?

583
00:38:01,206 --> 00:38:01,949
Speaker 1: Should we kill them?

584
00:38:02,109 --> 00:38:04,860
Speaker 1: Should we you know, should we wait for them to make this?

585
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:16,258
Speaker 0: I mean knowing that like the barbarian invasions will come and like Forcing Rome to consolidate the borders and defend them better early on like hundreds of years before that Cool stuff like that.

586
00:38:16,722 --> 00:38:24,258
Speaker 0: But the guards like are gonna you know Take this guy away and kill him or something and then the dude the main character is like are these your best men?

587
00:38:24,278 --> 00:38:24,860
Speaker 0: and Constantine's?

588
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:25,040
Speaker 0: Like?

589
00:38:25,562 --> 00:38:32,080
Speaker 0: yes, and he just shoots them all and Constantine to look at his face is like what what the all right?

590
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:52,396
Speaker 1: yeah, that's one thing is that even if you don't appreciate like the more cerebral aspects of this book or the Historical aspects or anything or the graphic design aspects which haven't even talked about yet you you can appreciate this book on a totally shallow level of Dude brings freaking Humvees and machine guns back to Constantine's time and shoots them up.

591
00:38:52,536 --> 00:39:00,570
Speaker 0: There's a great line where the dragon birth tank Johnson has always wanted but the Emperor says something effective.

592
00:39:01,231 --> 00:39:08,441
Speaker 0: you took out an army of a hundred and thousand elite Romans and Suffered three casualties 150 men.

593
00:39:08,481 --> 00:39:09,749
Speaker 0: yeah, they're like.

594
00:39:09,769 --> 00:39:11,720
Speaker 0: yeah, my truck like flipped over and we lost some guys.

595
00:39:12,702 --> 00:39:25,180
Speaker 0: It's an accident like they got killed but There is a two-page spread of modern military Descending upon two Roman armies locked in battle.

596
00:39:25,501 --> 00:39:26,947
Speaker 1: That's the best spread in the whole book.

597
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:31,165
Speaker 0: that is like you turn the page to that and you're just in awe of it Just like fuck.

598
00:39:31,206 --> 00:39:32,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what I was reading this for.

599
00:39:32,956 --> 00:39:33,157
Speaker 1: Fuck.

600
00:39:33,197 --> 00:39:33,540
Speaker 1: Yeah.

601
00:39:33,781 --> 00:39:39,962
Speaker 0: so the graphic design because you mentioned it is really surreal and all over the place and Really like.

602
00:39:40,042 --> 00:39:46,978
Speaker 0: it's really sparse and yet detailed like the characters are really detailed and usually black and white or black and white ish.

603
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:57,559
Speaker 0: and then the backgrounds are kind of like Orange to black and almost no other color and lots of weird text popping up everywhere And the background is almost non-existent.

604
00:39:57,921 --> 00:40:02,279
Speaker 1: Only I think he got he put less cray crammed in less tiny words all over the place.

605
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:10,920
Speaker 1: You know, that's the thing Jonathan Hickman actually comes from like a graphic design Background, you know, like he doesn't come from like a comic art background.

606
00:40:11,081 --> 00:40:18,119
Speaker 1: So, you know when he does like books from Marvel or whatever He sort of writes, you know a fantastic for a story and someone else draws it.

607
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:27,928
Speaker 1: But when he these books from image that he did all on his own, you know Like nightly news and Pax Romana and you know, I think trans human I think someone else might have done some are in trans human.

608
00:40:27,948 --> 00:40:43,097
Speaker 1: I don't remember but or red mass from ours I'm not sure who did the art on that either but you know He basically he graphic designs the thing and as opposed to you know Doing comic art and it actually makes this really really interesting effect of.

609
00:40:43,639 --> 00:40:50,488
Speaker 1: you know Like there are there's panels, but there's not really panels and there's words all over the place But you still know what order to read them in.

610
00:40:50,508 --> 00:40:51,071
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've got.

611
00:40:51,513 --> 00:41:04,856
Speaker 1: he's got all sorts of like recurring Symbols and colors that have meaning and you know, he basically just he treats the page, you know Like like he throws out all the rules of making comics, but he still obeys them.

612
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:18,799
Speaker 0: Yeah Plus the cat like all the characters unique I really I like the character design and I like the characters because again no one's I've had you dude Just no one is that stupid guy like in almost any media.

613
00:41:18,819 --> 00:41:23,013
Speaker 1: there's like Oh the guy who gets it on with the with the yeah, but he didn't.

614
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:31,444
Speaker 0: he wasn't that stupid guy who like You know, he's gonna fuck it all up and then he fucks it all up and then like it's not fun to read Whatever you're reading anymore That's true.

615
00:41:31,786 --> 00:41:35,140
Speaker 0: Yeah, there are too many works where like the stupid guy makes it not fun to read.

616
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, I know you're talking

617
00:41:37,541 --> 00:41:47,110
Speaker 0: Especially like if you've seen like say there's a movie or a sitcom before you've seen it and you know There's a point at which like the whole thing falls apart and you almost like cringe at the fact that you're gonna have to watch that again

618
00:41:48,064 --> 00:41:48,205
Speaker 1: Like

619
00:41:48,245 --> 00:41:54,251
Speaker 0: I'm gonna have to watch this guy fail And no one is like that in tax Romana.

620
00:41:54,371 --> 00:41:56,780
Speaker 0: Everyone's kind of cool and badass in their own way.

621
00:41:58,963 --> 00:42:12,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's mercenary assholes even the mercenaries even the The religious folk, you know, I guess the one the one character I have a question about you know, the mother current King the little kid King.

622
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,270
Speaker 0: I kind of like him though, because he's he's just.

623
00:42:14,471 --> 00:42:18,690
Speaker 1: he's kind of a snarky little kid Yeah, but I wonder what like, you know, it's like.

624
00:42:18,730 --> 00:42:19,533
Speaker 1: is he really smart?

625
00:42:19,573 --> 00:42:20,116
Speaker 1: does he get it?

626
00:42:20,136 --> 00:42:21,100
Speaker 1: or is he just you know?

627
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:21,642
Speaker 1: A little kid.

628
00:42:22,103 --> 00:42:22,665
Speaker 1: I think he's just.

629
00:42:22,685 --> 00:42:35,750
Speaker 1: I think he portrayed him as more as just a little kid and not actually a kid who could Actually do a good job of kinging King Arthur they show they portray him is like he could actually King it up, but this kid no way.

630
00:42:37,112 --> 00:42:41,879
Speaker 0: Thing that I can't really spoil but What else we can say without spoiling?

631
00:42:41,919 --> 00:42:43,125
Speaker 0: I mean, it's a great comic.

632
00:42:43,185 --> 00:42:44,070
Speaker 0: I'd recommend reading it.

633
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:44,882
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's one.

634
00:42:44,902 --> 00:42:45,349
Speaker 0: just buy it.

635
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:46,756
Speaker 0: you can just read it in like if you like.

636
00:42:46,796 --> 00:42:48,322
Speaker 1: it's all visiting teen emperors.

637
00:42:48,362 --> 00:42:49,628

00:42:50,614 --> 00:42:56,356
Speaker 0: if you like the idea of So they brought some nukes back with them right if you like.

640
00:42:56,436 --> 00:43:01,142
Speaker 0: if you like nukes verse Romans if you like the idea of Imagine if nukes are like.

641
00:43:01,182 --> 00:43:11,841
Speaker 0: the Romans had nukes From the future and they and then all the people who brought them long long later had all died of old age And they were like this ancient mysterious technology.

642
00:43:12,263 --> 00:43:19,904
Speaker 0: and then like 500 years later Someone uses that ancient and mysterious technology from the future.

643
00:43:23,251 --> 00:43:24,415
Speaker 1: Wow, it makes it.

644
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,017
Speaker 1: that's sort of like.

645
00:43:25,057 --> 00:43:28,970
Speaker 1: what if aliens came right now and brought us like I don't know like fusion blasters?

646
00:43:29,752 --> 00:43:32,229
Speaker 0: Or what if you know our precursors, but they didn't let us use them.

647
00:43:32,711 --> 00:43:40,375
Speaker 1: They just sort of held them there and then like a thousand years from now like Indiana Jones 30 10 dug them up.

648
00:43:40,736 --> 00:43:40,877
Speaker 0: Yeah.

649
00:43:40,897 --> 00:43:42,422
Speaker 0: Well, you know the analogy be like.

650
00:43:42,462 --> 00:43:43,607
Speaker 0: what if the pyramid was that?

651
00:43:43,647 --> 00:43:44,530
Speaker 0: the pyramids in Giza?

652
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:49,005
Speaker 0: You know in Egypt were actually some crazy machine and we just couldn't figure it out.

653
00:43:49,045 --> 00:43:54,516
Speaker 1: and one day we're like, oh shit Too bad, they're just a pile of rocks.

654
00:43:54,737 --> 00:44:01,018
Speaker 0: Yeah built with a spiral pattern in the middle Perhaps but Pax Ramon is fun.

655
00:44:01,299 --> 00:44:05,453
Speaker 0: I very much enjoyed it for a quick read and I don't know Like I'm saying.

656
00:44:06,115 --> 00:44:06,657
Speaker 1: how much is it?

657
00:44:07,841 --> 00:44:08,382
Speaker 0: Ah, I don't know.

658
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:11,333
Speaker 0: like it can't be more than like 10 or 15 bucks I'll put.

659
00:44:11,353 --> 00:44:12,559
Speaker 1: I'll put an Amazon link up.

660
00:44:12,720 --> 00:44:14,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, I put up an Amazon link.

661
00:44:14,086 --> 00:44:16,895
Speaker 1: It's worth buying And that'll be that.

662
00:44:17,217 --> 00:44:19,970
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean, I like bananas, but I need popsicles.

663
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:26,977
Speaker 0: I Think we'll.

664
00:44:27,037 --> 00:44:28,430
Speaker 0: we'll turn it off there.

665
00:44:28,651 --> 00:44:29,697
Speaker 0: This is the geek.

666
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:32,150
Speaker 0: nights will be weird and crazy for a while until we get situated.

667
00:44:32,331 --> 00:44:36,350
Speaker 0: So I'll probably make the audio quality of the Skype and a little better next time we do this.

668
00:44:36,932 --> 00:44:40,810
Speaker 0: And before we go we should do the meta moment really briefly because we forgot about the meta.

669
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:44,888
Speaker 0: We said I said, alright, let's not forget to do the meta moment.

670
00:44:44,928 --> 00:44:48,649
Speaker 0: Scott's like yes We will do the meta moment and then we did things of the day that we didn't do it.

671
00:44:49,231 --> 00:44:55,390
Speaker 1: All right, so meta moment, let's see number one episodes may or may not come out regularly while we are moving.

672
00:44:55,611 --> 00:44:58,058
Speaker 0: We're gonna do whatever two episodes per week.

673
00:44:58,098 --> 00:45:00,807
Speaker 0: We are feeling it'll be kind of all over the place.

674
00:45:01,429 --> 00:45:07,967
Speaker 1: Yep What else is a meta moment person who won the ad contest?
