1
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,602
Speaker 0: It's Wednesday July 22nd 2020.

2
00:00:12,602 --> 00:00:13,044
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,064 --> 00:00:15,872
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,912 --> 00:00:23,376
Speaker 0: We are talking about the post adventure time continuing adventure time adventure time distant lands episode 1 BMO.

5
00:00:27,664 --> 00:00:28,677
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:30,962 --> 00:00:38,660
Speaker 1: All right, so you know it's it's that time of the year when certain fruits are are in season The stone fruits the melons, that's right.

7
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:39,623
Speaker 1: So we've been getting stuff.

8
00:00:39,964 --> 00:00:40,124
Speaker 0: so

9
00:00:40,545 --> 00:00:55,911
Speaker 1: the last time we ordered some fruit to be delivered right because first of all in New York City You know you can get any kind of fruit, but most of the if you go to the grocery to buy fruit Usually it's not the highest quality perfect timed fruit.

10
00:00:55,991 --> 00:01:03,340
Speaker 1: It's usually like unripe too, right Yeah, not local right you can get some good stuff at the farmers market.

11
00:01:04,141 --> 00:01:06,951
Speaker 1: You can get some good stuff actually in Chinatown or really not.

12
00:01:06,991 --> 00:01:16,345
Speaker 0: fresh direct is usually really good about that because they actually tell You how good the fruit is and sometimes they're crazy stingy with that five-star Kinda, but you know.

13
00:01:16,405 --> 00:01:17,128
Speaker 1: so we got some.

14
00:01:17,148 --> 00:01:18,653
Speaker 1: we got some fresh direct fruits right.

15
00:01:18,693 --> 00:01:23,360
Speaker 1: so last time our fresh direct fruits We got we were like we don't know which fruits gonna be good.

16
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,968
Speaker 1: Let's get a couple yellow peach and also some doughnut.

17
00:01:26,028 --> 00:01:28,095
Speaker 0: Well how many stars were on that website?

18
00:01:28,135 --> 00:01:28,697
Speaker 0: That's the key.

19
00:01:29,259 --> 00:01:30,203
Speaker 1: whatever We got.

20
00:01:30,564 --> 00:01:39,740
Speaker 1: so we got two regular peach and four doughnut peach, and they all showed up, and they were all Kind of hard yeah, and so we waited a little bit till they were perfect and we ate him right away.

21
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:40,764
Speaker 0: Oh, they became perfect.

22
00:01:40,784 --> 00:01:41,708
Speaker 0: This was not the story.

23
00:01:41,748 --> 00:01:43,616
Speaker 0: if they went from hard to blackened no.

24
00:01:45,442 --> 00:01:46,489
Speaker 1: And then the doughnut ones.

25
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:48,120
Speaker 1: what got perfect if we ate those right away?

26
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, we decided the yellow ones were a little bit better than the doughnut ones.

27
00:01:51,981 --> 00:01:57,740
Speaker 0: Yeah, we also got a tiny watermelon, and we got a really good tiny watermelon the other day.

28
00:01:58,083 --> 00:01:59,700
Speaker 1: So the tiny watermelon was okay.

29
00:01:59,921 --> 00:02:02,730
Speaker 1: But then after it was is better like on.

30
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:09,862
Speaker 0: after cutting it open and letting it be in the fridge for a day or two We left ours in the fridge for a couple weeks and when we finally cracked it open It was just.

31
00:02:10,324 --> 00:02:11,511
Speaker 0: it was one of the better watermelons.

32
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:20,700
Speaker 1: I've had like not top ten, okay We only had our sit around for maybe less than one week before we opened it anyway, so so we order some more.

33
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:21,347
Speaker 1: We're like okay.

34
00:02:21,387 --> 00:02:22,560
Speaker 1: We like the yellow peach better.

35
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:27,300
Speaker 1: Let's order for yellow peach instead of two and no doughnut peach and let's order some.

36
00:02:28,081 --> 00:02:29,989
Speaker 1: You know cut up watermelon cuz we're lazy.

37
00:02:30,451 --> 00:02:31,073
Speaker 0: That's fair.

38
00:02:31,656 --> 00:02:37,520
Speaker 1: so the Cut up watermelon comes in four separate plastic containers.

39
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:38,789
Speaker 1: Is it just water?

40
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:42,142
Speaker 0: Ordered.

41
00:02:42,363 --> 00:02:43,888
Speaker 1: we ordered the minimum amount.

42
00:02:44,048 --> 00:02:44,891
Speaker 1: so it's like you.

43
00:02:45,032 --> 00:02:46,376
Speaker 1: what should the minimum amount be?

44
00:02:46,537 --> 00:02:47,340
Speaker 1: one of these containers?

45
00:02:48,782 --> 00:02:57,660
Speaker 0: Because I can order like a quarter pound of deli meat from them And they will send me this tiny package with like two slices of meat right exactly.

46
00:02:58,001 --> 00:02:59,926
Speaker 1: And then so the peaches right.

47
00:02:59,947 --> 00:03:04,580
Speaker 1: so we had ordered yellow peaches, and we got two normal-sized ones right and that was the right.

48
00:03:05,062 --> 00:03:08,715
Speaker 1: So we ordered four and we ordered the exact same thing on the website.

49
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:09,156
Speaker 1: We checked.

50
00:03:09,177 --> 00:03:10,100
Speaker 1: It was like a reorder.

51
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:13,332
Speaker 1: It was the exact same item right yellow peach or whatever.

52
00:03:13,553 --> 00:03:25,723
Speaker 1: no they sent us four enormous ones like Bigger than an orange like huge peaches so big I couldn't even eat a whole one I had to like.

53
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:30,000
Speaker 1: it's like cut it in half and like split it up when it finally got soft, right.

54
00:03:30,942 --> 00:03:35,452
Speaker 1: So we've eaten three of the four But it's like if I knew that they were gonna be this big I would only gotten two.

55
00:03:35,553 --> 00:03:39,294
Speaker 1: you should have cobbled made some cobbler But yeah, we had to basically you know.

56
00:03:39,476 --> 00:03:44,386
Speaker 1: again though They sent him to us hard, and we I basically every day I would wake up and poke them.

57
00:03:44,888 --> 00:03:46,315
Speaker 1: no and then it's it.

58
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:47,380
Speaker 1: I think it was two days ago.

59
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,289
Speaker 1: It was like oh eat him now eat him now.

60
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:49,671
Speaker 0: We did that.

61
00:03:49,711 --> 00:03:52,564
Speaker 0: we got a bunch of black plums in a Like.

62
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:58,716
Speaker 0: eat these today and every day I'd in the morning I'd open the fridge I'd poke every black plum and as soon as one of them was squishy.

63
00:03:58,777 --> 00:03:59,480
Speaker 0: I ate it instantly.

64
00:04:01,081 --> 00:04:09,062
Speaker 0: Okay, the weird thing is they came in a group before and they like ripened on like four different non consecutive days Mmm.

65
00:04:09,404 --> 00:04:10,933
Speaker 1: Oh wow it's raining a whole bunch of suddenly.

66
00:04:10,953 --> 00:04:12,220
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there's a big storm coming.

67
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:14,772
Speaker 0: It's gonna be storms and crap all weekend looks like okay.

68
00:04:15,475 --> 00:04:16,480
Speaker 1: Oh, I wanted to bike this week.

69
00:04:16,741 --> 00:04:17,726
Speaker 0: I might just bike anyway.

70
00:04:18,189 --> 00:04:19,135
Speaker 0: It's scattered storms.

71
00:04:19,154 --> 00:04:19,978
Speaker 0: You can get away with it.

72
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:22,087
Speaker 0: The thing is the heat waves still going.

73
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:23,872
Speaker 0: it's not gonna cool off at night.

74
00:04:23,973 --> 00:04:40,270
Speaker 0: It's it's like 95 during the day and like It says here Saturday 75 to 89 clear and Sunday 79 to 94. that is a radical change from what I was looking at Literally a little while ago trying to plan a bike ride.

75
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:45,569
Speaker 1: it also says rain through Friday though It's a Friday or super early on Friday like 2 a.m..

76
00:04:45,589 --> 00:04:53,820
Speaker 0: This the rain will I see Friday scattered thunderstorms in the morning Oh, yeah, and then Friday evening Saturday Sunday looks good, so I'm gonna buy and do some biking for anyway.

77
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:57,994
Speaker 0: Yeah But Sunday is gonna be 95 degrees heated at the index of a hundred and four.

78
00:04:58,195 --> 00:05:02,480
Speaker 1: so the point is Right as shitty as Florida is for just about everything.

79
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:08,563
Speaker 1: I still remember when I went to Florida and we went to this place near my grandma's house called the boys Market.

80
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:13,440
Speaker 0: you told me this story like ten times, but it's like all the fruits like the mango stories.

81
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:19,400
Speaker 1: Every fruit there was so cheap and and always just like perfect and incredibly delicious.

82
00:05:19,662 --> 00:05:22,840
Speaker 0: It's like well like when I was in Thailand, and I grabbed a banana.

83
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:27,256
Speaker 0: I've been into it and my mouth just said whatever this is you've never had a banana like this.

84
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:28,420
Speaker 0: This is the god banana.

85
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,191
Speaker 1: It's like every but like they didn't have.

86
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:38,400
Speaker 1: yeah, I guess they did have weird fruits Yeah, but I what we were just buying normal fruits cantaloupe Costa Rica like I remember like I always kind of like mangoes.

87
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:43,209
Speaker 0: But the first time I was in Costa Rica And I ate a mango that had been like recently just picked.

88
00:05:44,011 --> 00:05:46,096
Speaker 0: that was a transcendent experience.

89
00:05:46,196 --> 00:05:47,520
Speaker 0: I think back to that mango.

90
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:51,050
Speaker 1: Right why can't we just fucking ship it faster?

91
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:53,680
Speaker 0: Well if climate change gets bad novel just grow them here.

92
00:05:54,581 --> 00:05:57,710
Speaker 1: Well, but sure that'd be good, but good in some way good.

93
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:01,180
Speaker 0: It's definitely a silver lining on a on a fire.

94
00:06:04,843 --> 00:06:10,952
Speaker 1: The thing is we have Apple here apples our thing and we go and a lot of times you go eat an apple right off A tree and it's sometimes.

95
00:06:11,032 --> 00:06:11,618
Speaker 1: It's not that good.

96
00:06:12,061 --> 00:06:15,820
Speaker 0: Yeah apples are pretty variable unless you get like particularly good apples.

97
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:25,940
Speaker 0: But the particularly good apples that the truth of the universe that I've learned as I became older Is that the better the product of a plant tastes the more?

98
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:33,103
Speaker 0: Fiddly that plant is and the more care and effort and nonsense you have to do to make it not die and to make it Produce the thing you want.

99
00:06:33,745 --> 00:06:39,060
Speaker 1: yeah, I just want to remind everybody though that also in addition to fruit right now is the time of corn.

100
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:45,365
Speaker 1: So the thing about corn is like you can make Incredibly delicious meal.

101
00:06:45,787 --> 00:06:49,220
Speaker 1: that is like easier than like some crappy microwave food.

102
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,749
Speaker 1: Just get yourself a fucking ear of corn right.

103
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,640
Speaker 1: take the ear of corn remove the husk husk that shit.

104
00:06:54,640 --> 00:07:00,222
Speaker 1: Yeah, right cut that shit in half if you need to because in case it's too long it don't fit in your pot Right.

105
00:07:00,263 --> 00:07:01,186
Speaker 0: boil it a little bit.

106
00:07:01,627 --> 00:07:07,069
Speaker 0: put some salty ass water in the pot not salt potato level But like put a bunch of salt in there.

107
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,440
Speaker 1: put a bunch of salt in that water boil that shit.

108
00:07:10,161 --> 00:07:15,380
Speaker 1: Put the corn in that boiling water for literally five minute like exactly five minute.

109
00:07:15,904 --> 00:07:18,000
Speaker 1: Then just take the corn out put butter on and eat it.

110
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,874
Speaker 1: That's all you gotta do and it's fucking delicious corn.

111
00:07:20,955 --> 00:07:21,919
Speaker 1: and you feel like you cook.

112
00:07:22,462 --> 00:07:27,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, and now is the only time you can do that because if you wait too long Won't be good corn.

113
00:07:27,265 --> 00:07:28,047
Speaker 1: It'll be shitty corn.

114
00:07:28,228 --> 00:07:31,880
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you can even eat that corner raw and it's pretty good.

115
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:34,674
Speaker 0: I've eaten raw corn off the cob, but the tea like it raw corn.

116
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:35,840
Speaker 0: I do like it raw with the corn.

117
00:07:36,846 --> 00:07:37,537
Speaker 0: raw corn cup.

118
00:07:38,445 --> 00:07:40,759
Speaker 1: Old old dirty rim likes the corn raw.

119
00:07:43,001 --> 00:07:45,754
Speaker 0: Wow that just evoked Adam Sandler.

120
00:07:45,855 --> 00:07:46,860
Speaker 0: ask high school memories.

121
00:07:47,805 --> 00:07:49,133
Speaker 0: That was a very at it.

122
00:07:49,193 --> 00:07:55,339
Speaker 0: We that was a very Listening to Adam Sandler when you're like 14 and a freshman in high school.

123
00:07:57,762 --> 00:08:02,780
Speaker 0: So there is a bunch of anime news actually but the one you're probably all gonna be interested in is a Gretzky Co.

124
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,763
Speaker 1: yeah, so Gretzky Co.

125
00:08:05,863 --> 00:08:13,427
Speaker 1: for some reason Netflix had a season one and then they had a season two and it's like oh look at that one Season two was just like better done.

126
00:08:13,447 --> 00:08:13,728
Speaker 0: Like they.

127
00:08:13,769 --> 00:08:16,520
Speaker 1: just I didn't watch it, but I was planning to watch it.

128
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:19,432
Speaker 0: It's uh, so it's got an Elon Musk character in it.

129
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:21,299
Speaker 1: Oh, are they the bad guy?

130
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:22,985
Speaker 0: Uh, it's complicated.

131
00:08:23,106 --> 00:08:24,613
Speaker 0: watch your show great.

132
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:28,788
Speaker 1: The point is Surprise, this actually was a surprise.

133
00:08:28,848 --> 00:08:31,238
Speaker 1: I thought a Gretzky Co was done for nope season three.

134
00:08:31,298 --> 00:08:31,720
Speaker 1: It's coming.

135
00:08:31,921 --> 00:08:34,732
Speaker 0: Well, I think all right, it's gotten a lot of lanes like.

136
00:08:34,852 --> 00:08:37,126
Speaker 0: it's a pretty good show like it's not great But I like it.

137
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:38,299
Speaker 0: I watched all of it.

138
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,163
Speaker 0: I'll keep watching it.

139
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:44,800
Speaker 0: but and and generally like anime fans like like it to a degree but they're not like going crazy over it.

140
00:08:45,021 --> 00:08:52,889
Speaker 0: They're not like getting tattoos of it like they do Attack on Titan or someone has a tattoo somewhere I'm sure but not not the weeb level.

141
00:08:52,909 --> 00:08:53,330
Speaker 0: more like.

142
00:08:53,932 --> 00:09:03,520
Speaker 0: I see a lot of people who don't watch a lot of anime But just watch Netflix Like people who don't even really think about anime getting really into this show because it's got a perfectly good dub.

143
00:09:04,022 --> 00:09:12,700
Speaker 0: It's just on Netflix and a lot of what goes on in the show really speaks to The kinds of problems that a lot of people run into in their actual offices.

144
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:15,992
Speaker 1: Mmm, it is a combo there, right?

145
00:09:16,012 --> 00:09:30,000
Speaker 1: So no, you know, it's not like Detroit Metal City, which is you know, the the The Unexpected character is into is a death metal person, right but it's you know, it's office humor plus, right?

146
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,169
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's all the layers in a grits ago.

147
00:09:32,952 --> 00:09:33,977
Speaker 1: We did a show in a grits ago.

148
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:34,640
Speaker 1: You can go listen to it.

149
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,198
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did it.

150
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,942
Speaker 1: The thing is I don't know if anything in that show and if anything in that episode I said It was any.

151
00:09:40,003 --> 00:09:48,331
Speaker 0: you are not into that show and that review like you were really down on a grits ago I don't remember at all Because I may.

152
00:09:48,391 --> 00:09:59,945
Speaker 0: I took the review itself out of the whole geek nights episode and made a YouTube video that I haven't published yet as part of that pipeline with the standalone reviews and I noticed the review was only like Nine and a half minutes long.

153
00:10:00,587 --> 00:10:04,660
Speaker 0: So I went to listen and it's basically you being like yeah, Gretzky go ain't that good?

154
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,388
Speaker 0: I don't know if I'll even watch the rest of it.

155
00:10:06,448 --> 00:10:08,540
Speaker 0: Why at the end I can review it from one episode.

156
00:10:09,482 --> 00:10:11,658
Speaker 1: Okay, if you're really that's also true is that?

157
00:10:13,203 --> 00:10:17,540
Speaker 1: Anyway, I There is something else that I want to say about some Netflix anime, right?

158
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,106
Speaker 1: So we did an episode on the not-so-great ghost in the shell 2045 Yep.

159
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:28,958
Speaker 0: So one person tried to come at me and say that the writing is just as good as standalone complex and we're just hitting on It because of the animation.

160
00:10:29,781 --> 00:10:31,187
Speaker 1: Whatever that person said is right.

161
00:10:31,247 --> 00:10:33,075
Speaker 0: Yeah, I disagree with that that right.

162
00:10:33,095 --> 00:10:34,928
Speaker 0: So I watch Huh?

163
00:10:35,231 --> 00:10:37,525
Speaker 1: I did watch All of the show.

164
00:10:37,545 --> 00:10:38,008
Speaker 0: Whoa.

165
00:10:38,108 --> 00:10:40,320
Speaker 0: Whoa, wait, wait, why?

166
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:43,247
Speaker 1: Cuz I had I was like I was.

167
00:10:43,327 --> 00:10:48,446
Speaker 1: I was thinking there and I was like, you know what this thing really isn't that long All right, it's only 12 true.

168
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:49,068
Speaker 0: Maybe you can.

169
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,373
Speaker 0: I've already watched it like.

170
00:10:50,634 --> 00:10:52,160
Speaker 1: I've already watched a third of it.

171
00:10:52,582 --> 00:10:55,939
Speaker 1: I bet no one else has watched a third of it as it has watched all of it.

172
00:10:56,363 --> 00:11:05,268
Speaker 0: I guess there's a point you make there to The show even if it's bad if it has even like the bear is glimmer of some of the parts I like from standalone complex.

173
00:11:05,811 --> 00:11:07,280
Speaker 0: the juice might be worth the squeeze.

174
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:09,091
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

175
00:11:09,172 --> 00:11:09,274
Speaker 1: no.

176
00:11:12,101 --> 00:11:16,420
Speaker 1: So, you know, I was like, hey, maybe if I watch to the later episodes, right?

177
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:20,916
Speaker 1: I was thinking maybe there'll be something so ridiculous there that I could post it on the internet.

178
00:11:20,976 --> 00:11:24,029
Speaker 1: and because no one else has seen It because no one posted anything.

179
00:11:24,069 --> 00:11:26,400
Speaker 0: I can find a guy back flipping backwards up the stairs.

180
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:29,159
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's in an early episode has to be crazy on that.

181
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:45,102
Speaker 1: so here's so I can tell you that basically the rest of the show is, you know, basically once they get back to You know Japan they make section 9 and it becomes much more episodic, you know trying to find the whatever They are called.

182
00:11:45,123 --> 00:11:50,100
Speaker 1: I don't even remember, you know, the fortnight players and whatever that shows.

183
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,798
Speaker 1: Yeah, the people with the super the super strong, you know transhuman people, right?

184
00:11:54,878 --> 00:11:59,515
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah The ones they find like aren't nearly as strong as that first one.

185
00:11:59,536 --> 00:12:03,540
Speaker 1: that like that first one They found the naked guy was like super dangerous.

186
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:11,546
Speaker 1: Right the ones they go after after they get back to Japan are like not even remotely Doesn't work stand-alone complex.

187
00:12:11,646 --> 00:12:16,960
Speaker 0: part of why it was good was that the threat they were facing was like an entire government and military.

188
00:12:17,823 --> 00:12:33,220
Speaker 1: They introduce a character who is basically like a very Anime, like yay Character who like stays in the in the office and like works the touch of comas and does computer stuff and makes mischief and whatever.

189
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:35,554
Speaker 1: It's an annoying character.

190
00:12:35,575 --> 00:12:42,085
Speaker 1: Yeah But what I do want to tell you is that the episode Someone told me.

191
00:12:42,105 --> 00:12:43,992
Speaker 1: Oh, you got a episode 7.

192
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:53,488
Speaker 1: I have something about episode 7. so episode 7 is basically the only episode with any glimmer of Ghost in the shell.

193
00:12:53,508 --> 00:12:55,200
Speaker 1: standalone complex quality, right?

194
00:12:55,320 --> 00:13:02,480
Speaker 1: So here's what happens in episode 7 is that it's basically Bato is going back to Japan on a plane alone ahead of everyone else.

195
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:03,639
Speaker 1: He's going back first, right?

196
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:11,004
Speaker 1: All right, and he gets a little helicopter ride and in the helicopter ride is the introduction of that annoying characters But it's brief.

197
00:13:11,205 --> 00:13:13,776
Speaker 1: so you can see what that annoying character is, right?

198
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,063
Speaker 0: Get a little taste.

199
00:13:16,204 --> 00:13:18,640
Speaker 1: inoculate yourself, right get a little taste.

200
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:25,745
Speaker 1: So, you know what they're that that character is gonna be a prominent character in the show going forward and then they leave and they're Not in the rest of the episode.

201
00:13:25,785 --> 00:13:27,632
Speaker 1: So you you can just get that information.

202
00:13:28,274 --> 00:13:35,785
Speaker 1: and the rest of the episode is Bato goes to the bank to deposit Launder his illicit.

203
00:13:35,985 --> 00:13:43,945
Speaker 1: other people have told me about this episode from mercenary work, right and someone else Tries to rob the bank.

204
00:13:44,386 --> 00:13:54,144
Speaker 1: and the whole episode is Bato trapped in the bank with The old people who are the only ones who go to the bank anymore And the bank robbers.

205
00:13:54,244 --> 00:13:57,372
Speaker 0: that feels a lot like Aramaki seller kind of episode.

206
00:13:57,813 --> 00:14:00,280
Speaker 1: or is a very or the pachinko parlor episodes?

207
00:14:01,002 --> 00:14:04,977
Speaker 1: It is exactly like that kind of episode but only Bato's in it.

208
00:14:05,178 --> 00:14:07,580
Speaker 0: So I'll watch that episode.

209
00:14:08,262 --> 00:14:14,500
Speaker 1: Right, if you have not watched Ghost in the Shell 2045, all you need to know is that all the characters?

210
00:14:15,663 --> 00:14:16,887
Speaker 1: Were in the u.s.

211
00:14:16,927 --> 00:14:25,954
Speaker 1: Doing mercenary work and they're now on their way back to make section 9 again and Bato is going to the bank with his money that he made being a mercenary.

212
00:14:26,154 --> 00:14:38,663
Speaker 1: and you don't need any other information to understand this episode And you don't need in this episode will also not make you curious about any of the overall plot of this whole 12 episode thing because it's a standalone Episode.

213
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:41,055
Speaker 0: Oh standalone you say so.

214
00:14:41,115 --> 00:14:45,939
Speaker 0: indeed is the Intended wording that pink haired purin is a key?

215
00:14:46,910 --> 00:15:01,321
Speaker 0: Yes, okay Because when I googled for sack 2045 episode 7 just to see some screenshots while we're having this conversation What immediately comes up is this meme that shows that character with an X through their face and it just says no more purin is Aki.

216
00:15:01,602 --> 00:15:03,146
Speaker 0: society has progressed past.

217
00:15:03,186 --> 00:15:05,012
Speaker 0: the need for purin is Aki.

218
00:15:06,356 --> 00:15:09,946
Speaker 0: I Need for this kind of character in a show.

219
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:11,771
Speaker 1: it is a very.

220
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:19,535
Speaker 0: it feels like a very 90s anime annoying cute Sidekick that gets a bunch of over sexualized merch character.

221
00:15:19,555 --> 00:15:23,051
Speaker 1: Uh She's not sexualized in the show.

222
00:15:23,071 --> 00:15:24,257
Speaker 0: She'll be sexualized in the merch.

223
00:15:24,297 --> 00:15:24,920
Speaker 0: I guarantee it.

224
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:34,315
Speaker 1: I'm sure she will be but it's basically like yeah, she's this super smart girl, but she has a very, you know, anime personality Stereotypical anime.

225
00:15:34,376 --> 00:15:36,245
Speaker 1: Yay Personality, right?

226
00:15:36,365 --> 00:15:39,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think anime has progressed past the need for that.

227
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:42,618
Speaker 1: Yes So, there you go.

228
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,631
Speaker 0: So speaking of a show that I watched I mentioned this a couple times.

229
00:15:45,691 --> 00:15:49,506
Speaker 0: I was watching it with Emily but keep oh and the age Of Wonder Beasts the.

230
00:15:49,627 --> 00:15:50,590
Speaker 0: it's all just on Netflix.

231
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:54,204
Speaker 0: Like we're just kind of watching it between all the other shows we're watching But we finished it.

232
00:15:54,224 --> 00:15:55,168
Speaker 0: There's two seasons out.

233
00:15:55,208 --> 00:16:01,108
Speaker 0: We watched them both all the way to the end and the show is Definitely worth watching.

234
00:16:01,189 --> 00:16:03,120
Speaker 0: It's a DreamWorks television animation.

235
00:16:03,607 --> 00:16:04,319
Speaker 0: It's aimed at kids.

236
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:12,479
Speaker 0: It starts out kind of like She-Ra is a like super kids show but it actually does a much more complex plot than I expected.

237
00:16:12,539 --> 00:16:16,651
Speaker 0: like What's the deal with the Burroughs and the humans underground?

238
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:17,453
Speaker 0: and like.

239
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:18,757
Speaker 0: but all.

240
00:16:18,837 --> 00:16:21,487
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna spoil anything But for a kids show.

241
00:16:21,507 --> 00:16:32,640
Speaker 0: this went way further and way Darker than I would have ever expected and also the vast majority of the human characters that get any screen time are not white.

242
00:16:34,242 --> 00:16:35,857
Speaker 0: There's like no white people in this show.

243
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:37,232
Speaker 1: that's nice.

244
00:16:37,698 --> 00:16:43,459
Speaker 0: and Otherwise, like if you haven't checked this show out This is the last I'm gonna speak about it because I've mentioned it several times along the way.

245
00:16:44,065 --> 00:16:52,659
Speaker 0: Having seen the end of season two They have definitely set up a season three But they have also answered all the questions you had from season one and two.

246
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:59,362
Speaker 0: So if there never was a season three You're not gonna be tearing your hair out trying to figure out what the deal was with anything Like.

247
00:16:59,403 --> 00:17:08,455
Speaker 1: I noticed a lot of Netflix shows are following that pattern of Wrap up your plot and leave room for another season, but don't guarantee another season.

248
00:17:08,616 --> 00:17:10,425
Speaker 1: most recently BNA Did the up.

249
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:11,819
Speaker 0: Dragon Prince did that?

250
00:17:12,859 --> 00:17:14,240
Speaker 1: The Dragon Prince seems to always do that.

251
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,363
Speaker 0: Yeah With one exception.

252
00:17:15,403 --> 00:17:20,980
Speaker 0: Dragon Prince did not answer shit about what's the deal with their dad in that bird that escaped.

253
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:24,063
Speaker 0: They just like drop that thread Really?

254
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:30,151
Speaker 1: I mean it was so obvious that the dad is in the bird And they just added it so heavily.

255
00:17:30,312 --> 00:17:36,573
Speaker 0: it's like Chekhov's gun and then like Someone sneaks on stage and steals the gun and then the play ends.

256
00:17:37,415 --> 00:17:37,816
Speaker 1: I'm mad.

257
00:17:37,997 --> 00:17:39,000
Speaker 1: I just want all I want.

258
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,662
Speaker 1: It was dad bird.

259
00:17:39,682 --> 00:17:43,876
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz also that dad is pretty hot and probably like you foreshadowed it.

260
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:44,920
Speaker 1: Just let it let it go.

261
00:17:45,382 --> 00:17:48,540
Speaker 1: Let them learn magic and take the dad out of the bird and put him in a new body.

262
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:52,593
Speaker 0: Yeah, or just haven't come back and like go to the show, right?

263
00:17:52,613 --> 00:17:53,576
Speaker 1: They go to the Dragons.

264
00:17:53,616 --> 00:17:55,744
Speaker 1: the Dragons, you know They make friends with them.

265
00:17:55,784 --> 00:17:57,572
Speaker 1: Then the Dragons help them get dad out of the bird.

266
00:17:57,713 --> 00:17:58,014
Speaker 1: Yeah.

267
00:17:58,115 --> 00:17:58,396
Speaker 0: Yeah.

268
00:17:58,818 --> 00:17:59,240
Speaker 1: All right, come on.

Speaker 0: Yeah keep us worth watching.

271
00:18:01,824 --> 00:18:10,299
Speaker 0: and all I gotta say is you think you know what the deal is with these humans and it is Not what you think and it's pretty good what the actual story is.

272
00:18:11,323 --> 00:18:12,131
Speaker 1: All right, that's nice.

273
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:12,900

00:19:40,783 --> 00:19:42,798
Speaker 1: Yep, DVD guy, right?

289
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,146
Speaker 1: Nothing, you know, there's the sword.

00:19:45,186 --> 00:19:48,220
Speaker 0: you the sword booth just or guys sword booth, right?

291
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:53,160
Speaker 1: And you know, there's a certain kind of booth right that sometimes is not even a booth.

292
00:19:53,341 --> 00:20:02,570
Speaker 1: Usually it's more often it go to a standalone anime store that's been around a long time Right where they've got the old stuff, right?

293
00:20:02,751 --> 00:20:06,580
Speaker 1: We're talking like, you know old dusty Godzilla figurines.

294
00:20:07,662 --> 00:20:09,410
Speaker 1: You know that kind of booth the kind.

295
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:19,170
Speaker 1: that's the kind of booth where you won't buy anything but you'll spend a lot of time looking at that booth and they'll have like an Actual Akira t-shirt from the 80s for a hundred bucks.

296
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:22,780
Speaker 1: Yeah and shit like that right that kind of booth.

297
00:20:22,841 --> 00:20:39,400
Speaker 1: Well, it's more like a museum Exactly, but I found I'm sure this has been around for a long time and I just didn't know about it There is a store called Kimono my house toys And I guess their Instagram and their eBay site are basically their website.

298
00:20:41,398 --> 00:20:48,364
Speaker 1: and basically, that's what they are is they are the super old dusty anime merch.

299
00:20:48,484 --> 00:21:00,074
Speaker 1: lots of Gundam lots of Ultraman lots of Godzilla lots of You know lots of Galaxy Express Yamato captain Harlock's Astro boy.

300
00:21:00,094 --> 00:21:02,100
Speaker 1: all you know the old stuff, right?

301
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:04,970
Speaker 1: That's the kind of stuff that they got at that store.

302
00:21:05,091 --> 00:21:07,620
Speaker 0: That's my kind of stuff right, you know?

303
00:21:08,784 --> 00:21:09,858
Speaker 0: Don't buy any of that stuff?

304
00:21:10,913 --> 00:21:11,292
Speaker 1: No, no No.

305
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:17,720
Speaker 1: Well, you can go to their eBay and buy it because I presume their store is not open to that many customers these days.

306
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:28,320
Speaker 1: But just follow them, you know peruse their Instagram account to get that experience of Going to one of those booths at an anime con since you can't go to anime con right now, right?

307
00:21:28,601 --> 00:21:33,880
Speaker 1: You can get that experience of the old dusty booth, and you can maybe even buy stuff if you really want to.

308
00:21:35,664 --> 00:21:42,332
Speaker 1: But you can also just follow them on Instagram And you'll constantly get posts from them as they post photos of their stuff.

309
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:52,647
Speaker 1: for example mr.. T wearing an Akira t-shirt Or a whole bunch of pit Akira pins and lensman pins on a board You know.

310
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:57,929
Speaker 1: or the San Diego comic-con 1992 you know t-shirt.

311
00:21:57,949 --> 00:22:02,160
Speaker 1: or this giant pile of old Disney stickers who knows if they're still sticky.

312
00:22:02,544 --> 00:22:03,698
Speaker 1: But I kind of want one.

313
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:08,839
Speaker 1: All kinds of great stuff on this Instagram from this store, so there you go.

314
00:22:09,363 --> 00:22:17,260
Speaker 0: So this is a Twitter thread But it's a pretty dense Twitter thread of exactly what you want to see without any text or anything in the way.

315
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:18,123
Speaker 0: It's just a long thread.

316
00:22:18,143 --> 00:22:19,387
Speaker 0: You can just scroll down and enjoy.

317
00:22:19,407 --> 00:22:31,533
Speaker 0: it is just a whole bunch of photos of Soviet bus stops from all over the Soviet Union and The reason why these are so cool is something.

318
00:22:31,593 --> 00:22:32,980
Speaker 0: I only learned about recently.

319
00:22:33,362 --> 00:22:34,968
Speaker 1: I feel like I've seen these before.

320
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,374
Speaker 1: talked about them on the show before.

321
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:39,345
Speaker 1: I think we've seen a few nice Because they see they.

322
00:22:39,385 --> 00:22:42,055
Speaker 1: I've definitely seen some of these before in my life.

323
00:22:42,075 --> 00:22:43,520
Speaker 1: They're familiar to my eyeball.

324
00:22:43,681 --> 00:22:45,150
Speaker 0: Yeah, I hope I didn't reuse that.

325
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:46,840
Speaker 0: I did a search and didn't find a thing of the day.

326
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:49,999
Speaker 1: There was I think there was a Kickstarter for a Soviet bus stop book.

327
00:22:51,142 --> 00:22:55,920
Speaker 0: If I talk about we might have talked about talked about that book, but basically this is just an archive of all these photos.

328
00:22:56,001 --> 00:22:59,019
Speaker 0: but what I learned from this thread is Why?

329
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,073
Speaker 0: Specifically Soviet bus stops are so crazy compared to a lot of other Soviet architecture.

330
00:23:04,093 --> 00:23:06,060
Speaker 0: That's so utilitarian and samey.

331
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:13,999
Speaker 0: What it came down to is the central government Didn't give a shit what bus stops looked like like they didn't care at all.

332
00:23:14,482 --> 00:23:36,480
Speaker 0: So when they told a local area to make bus stops The local area had complete discretion to do whatever they wanted and they tended to Get architects who wanted to just go crazy and do something cool And as a result They are so radically different like every area of the Soviet Union has Radically different styles of the things that the central government didn't care about.

333
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:51,772
Speaker 0: So if you want to find cool stuff on the internet try to find more examples of things that were very important to the Soviet Union But where the government of the Soviet Union did not have any particular ideological concerns about the nature of said thing.

334
00:23:52,434 --> 00:24:02,050
Speaker 1: what I find really interesting is that You know you look Historically right and that you know, the very Milton Friedman capitalism is freedom.

335
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:16,253
Speaker 1: people right are always like, ah, you know if the government is is Paying for the art and control in the art It's like, you know, it's like you won't be able to print any sign you want if the government owns the printing press Right to get the government's paying for the art.

336
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:33,812
Speaker 1: You're gonna get meanwhile Cool bus stop in America like anyway, what I'm saying though is if you look at you know The art that is produced by you know government's paying for it Even if that art is propaganda like Soviet stuff often was.

337
00:24:33,873 --> 00:24:40,815
Speaker 1: yeah, it's often fucking cool No matter what country it's in evil country or a good country or anywhere in between.

338
00:24:40,855 --> 00:24:45,160
Speaker 0: right if an artist paid a living Way to make something they'll try to do a good job.

339
00:24:47,405 --> 00:24:54,748
Speaker 1: Look at the mosaics you get in like New York City subway stations, right, you know, even North Korean shit, which is At least, you know.

340
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:58,305
Speaker 1: all those propaganda posters look cool Even though they're all.

341
00:24:58,365 --> 00:25:00,713
Speaker 1: you know, it's awful, but it's right.

342
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:02,800
Speaker 1: It's like when government pays money, you know.

343
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:04,285
Speaker 1: Look at all the Canadian animation.

344
00:25:04,326 --> 00:25:06,273
Speaker 1: the government pays people to make art kpop.

345
00:25:06,313 --> 00:25:08,220
Speaker 1: is the government paying people to make art, right?

346
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,208
Speaker 1: They get all kpop.

347
00:25:09,229 --> 00:25:10,320
Speaker 1: people are getting government money.

348
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:15,800
Speaker 0: Do you understand how good geek nights would be if the government just paid us to make it right?

349
00:25:16,041 --> 00:25:22,270
Speaker 1: And that's the government was paying podcasters because they felt that Podcasts were an important thing to have and we were getting.

350
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,880
Speaker 1: we like applied for a government thing and they were sending us cash.

351
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:27,690
Speaker 1: It's like oh man, he would be killing it.

352
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:28,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, we were.

353
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:39,483
Speaker 1: I would I would start doing a lot of things that I do Not do today Right, so it's you know, any kind of government funded art is like, you know government funding for the arts PBS All right.

354
00:25:39,503 --> 00:25:39,824
Speaker 1: Come on.

355
00:25:39,904 --> 00:25:40,647

Speaker 0: The Thunder outside is actually getting pretty intense.

00:29:36,630 --> 00:29:49,144
Speaker 0: what's interesting is it says rediscover their brotherly blah bond Implying that something might have broken that bond at some who knows who knows when in the adventure time time timeline The episode takes place.

430
00:29:49,184 --> 00:29:53,315
Speaker 0: Yes, because not to spoil anything but BMO does not take place.

431
00:29:53,395 --> 00:29:55,280
Speaker 0: when I assumed it took place, right?

432
00:29:55,380 --> 00:30:02,560
Speaker 1: We assumed oh, okay These episodes are going to take place after the end of the TV show But before the end end of the TV show, right?

433
00:30:02,620 --> 00:30:02,821
Speaker 1: Cuz the.

434
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:19,819
Speaker 1: basically the TV show has epilogue at the end that take place far in the future from The actual like end of the plot of the main characters and you would assume like all four of these episodes are gonna take place after the end of the TV show, but before the epilogue end of the TV show

435
00:30:20,442 --> 00:30:27,175
Speaker 0: Because we know for a fact obsidian takes pleasure not obsidian wizard city takes place after Because it is reacting to events from the show.

436
00:30:27,738 --> 00:30:46,610
Speaker 1: sure but anyway That is not necessarily the case as we learned watching this it could take place anytime in the adventure time timeline prequel in the middle of the show anywhere, right But they are canon adventure time animations That are not ever before seen and that is awesome.

437
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:50,660
Speaker 1: that they're continuing to make these and they're on HBO max.

438
00:30:51,241 --> 00:30:56,779
Speaker 0: Yep, I I definitely watched it on HBO max and did I not sail a high sea anywhere?

439
00:30:59,862 --> 00:31:11,433
Speaker 0: All I will say is if you are not technologically savvy and you find this show somewhere and Your media player tries to tell you to buy a codec do not do that.

440
00:31:11,914 --> 00:31:14,060
Speaker 0: Just find a different file.

441
00:31:14,222 --> 00:31:15,515
Speaker 0: That's all I'm gonna say about that.

442
00:31:16,302 --> 00:31:20,769
Speaker 1: Anyway, but a point is HBO max does have Some good content.

443
00:31:20,829 --> 00:31:30,560
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, like it's actually like You know like worth watching maybe if that's if that is the content you like the most, you know, it's got Studio Ghibli stuff.

444
00:31:30,801 --> 00:31:33,509
Speaker 1: It's got Cartoon Network stuff, obviously, right?

445
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:34,513
Speaker 1: It's got.

446
00:31:34,693 --> 00:31:36,740
Speaker 0: it's got bits of the Criterion collection.

447
00:31:37,001 --> 00:31:38,347
Speaker 0: It's got it crunchy roll stuff.

448
00:31:38,367 --> 00:31:39,993
Speaker 1: There's all kinds of stuff on HBO.

449
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:41,600
Speaker 0: man of our barbera Warner Brothers.

450
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:46,495
Speaker 1: Yeah It is not a bad thing to subscribe to if that's the one you're gonna subscribe to.

451
00:31:46,535 --> 00:31:48,966
Speaker 1: but I'm on Netflix right now And I don't do two at a time.

452
00:31:49,086 --> 00:31:50,594
Speaker 0: Well - I'm on Netflix.

453
00:31:50,795 --> 00:31:51,680
Speaker 0: crunchy roll.

454
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:53,933
Speaker 1: I actually have been watching the crunchy roll in a long time.

455
00:31:53,973 --> 00:31:55,140
Speaker 1: I should turn it off and turn out again.

456
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:59,360
Speaker 1: The problem is they always get this annual crunchy roll to save money and I do use it every year.

457
00:31:59,942 --> 00:32:00,826
Speaker 1: I just don't use it every month.

458
00:32:01,007 --> 00:32:09,578
Speaker 0: I've actually used it recently to get screen caps of Anime, we've reviewed to make those YouTube videos Mmm, so it actually anyway out.

459
00:32:10,403 --> 00:32:14,600
Speaker 1: So yeah, but you know if you if you want to watch this legally you can pay for HBO max.

460
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:16,848
Speaker 1: I don't know if it's available anywhere else at all.

461
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,775
Speaker 0: You pretty sure it's HBO max exclusive.

462
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,046
Speaker 1: if you have television Can you even watch this?

463
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:23,540
Speaker 1: Oh just cape cable TV and you watch HBO?

464
00:32:23,941 --> 00:32:26,675
Speaker 1: No, like will it be on demand on your cable box?

465
00:32:26,936 --> 00:32:27,760
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

466
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,967
Speaker 0: I think it's only on HBO max.

467
00:32:30,328 --> 00:32:30,990
Speaker 1: That's interesting.

468
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:33,417
Speaker 1: Anyway, the point is it's Adventure Time.

469
00:32:33,758 --> 00:32:34,340
Speaker 1: We watched it.

470
00:32:34,401 --> 00:32:35,497
Speaker 1: Let's talk about what we watch.

471
00:32:35,558 --> 00:32:36,710
Speaker 0: Yep We'll avoid spoilers.

472
00:32:37,194 --> 00:32:52,725
Speaker 0: at the very end we can talk a little bit about like our thoughts on what it revealed about the universe, but it is Really really cute because they introduced this rabbit girl character and it's basically this rabbit girl and BMO going around on a space Station that's falling apart

473
00:32:53,146 --> 00:32:55,214
Speaker 1: while a BMO is out on my

474
00:32:55,716 --> 00:32:56,620
Speaker 0: tries to destroy it.

475
00:32:57,043 --> 00:32:58,679
Speaker 1: BMO is out in space on a mission.

476
00:33:00,142 --> 00:33:02,200
Speaker 1: BMO ends up in a different world.

477
00:33:02,421 --> 00:33:16,210
Speaker 1: the world is basically not a planet but a space station sort of platform that has different domes that are connected and the different domes have different habitats in them and Clearly the people on the dome.

478
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:18,460
Speaker 1: so there's like crab people and robot people.

479
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:25,500
Speaker 0: There's crab people robot people bunny people and bunny people and then a whole bunch of like minor races that are also hanging out there.

480
00:33:25,801 --> 00:33:28,091
Speaker 0: It's definitely like a cosmopolitan space city.

481
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:33,164
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's some you know, there's some like Those bug guys.

482
00:33:33,485 --> 00:33:34,307
Speaker 1: Yeah monsters.

483
00:33:34,367 --> 00:33:35,732
Speaker 0: I love the little bug guys.

484
00:33:35,752 --> 00:33:38,380
Speaker 1: Yeah, all kinds of space shit is going on there, right?

485
00:33:39,823 --> 00:34:04,364
Speaker 1: And so, you know BMO ends up there via circumstances and the shenanigans there that he BMO discovers that the people there are like fighting over like You know resources because they're stuck on the station and there's certain rare Resources that they're fighting over and BMO gets involved in saving the day because it seems like most of the people there are sort of just content or compliant with their situation.

486
00:34:04,886 --> 00:34:11,466
Speaker 1: and BMO is like, you know being BMO seeing the injustice and being like yeah Adventure and

487
00:34:12,007 --> 00:34:26,469
Speaker 0: but it's very interesting to show cuz you it's been in Jake or some other characters are the driving powerful forces and BMO is either a cute sidekick or BMO is a catalyst but they save the day.

488
00:34:26,810 --> 00:34:28,174
Speaker 0: obviously there's exceptions to that.

489
00:34:28,655 --> 00:34:39,199
Speaker 0: But in this case BMO is the catalyst But is also like the mentor driving forward the plot and dragging this other character along.

490
00:34:39,742 --> 00:34:40,524
Speaker 0: It's a different.

491
00:34:40,563 --> 00:34:45,100
Speaker 0: it's like an inversion of what often happens in Adventure Time episodes when BMO is involved.

492
00:34:46,083 --> 00:34:46,764
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like BMO.

493
00:34:46,784 --> 00:34:49,713
Speaker 1: basically, you know sees like hey, there's some BS going on.

494
00:34:49,774 --> 00:34:50,676
Speaker 1: Let's fix it.

495
00:34:50,757 --> 00:34:53,620
Speaker 0: Yippee-ki-yay Kind of literally.

496
00:34:54,469 --> 00:35:03,097
Speaker 0: Yep You can sort of see like this is Sheriff BMO BMO literals like well I'm the sheriff of this town and I love how a lot of the people BMO meets are just like.

497
00:35:03,719 --> 00:35:06,125
Speaker 0: alright I guess you're the sheriff sure.

498
00:35:06,226 --> 00:35:14,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in typical BMO fashion BMO is simultaneously like playing while also You know not playing right?

499
00:35:14,937 --> 00:35:17,628
Speaker 0: Yep I love I love that duality of BMO.

500
00:35:17,689 --> 00:35:20,680
Speaker 0: all the time BMO is playing games because BMO is a toy, right?

501
00:35:20,740 --> 00:35:22,186
Speaker 1: So BMO is about playing.

502
00:35:22,206 --> 00:35:29,360
Speaker 0: Yep, but BMO is also special for the reasons We know from the show and thus BMO is a literal catalyst for good.

503
00:35:30,542 --> 00:35:35,784
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think if you haven't watched Adventure Time, I don't know This would guess you can.

504
00:35:35,865 --> 00:35:41,725
Speaker 1: I guess you can watch this but you would just some things would be lost on you one Big one in particular.

505
00:35:42,086 --> 00:35:43,170
Speaker 0: Well - lost.

506
00:35:43,250 --> 00:35:44,816
Speaker 0: I can think of a couple of big ones.

507
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:46,040
Speaker 0: That would be lost as one.

508
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:47,547
Speaker 1: I think that is vastly bigger.

509
00:35:47,668 --> 00:35:48,029
Speaker 1: Yeah.

510
00:35:48,391 --> 00:35:52,801
Speaker 0: Yeah, but there's also little things like football like That.

511
00:35:53,021 --> 00:35:53,804
Speaker 0: yeah, you're right.

512
00:35:53,844 --> 00:35:58,357
Speaker 0: Football is portrayed very well in this and I really like how that played out.

513
00:35:58,377 --> 00:36:03,119
Speaker 0: I Think it would still work if you'd never seen Adventure Time, but it would work.

514
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,063
Speaker 1: But yeah, you wouldn't.

515
00:36:04,525 --> 00:36:06,915
Speaker 1: you would be like, oh, I guess BMO has an imaginary friend.

516
00:36:06,935 --> 00:36:08,200
Speaker 1: whenever they look in a reflection.

517
00:36:08,381 --> 00:36:11,920
Speaker 1: This is yeah, but BMO's reflection is named football and BMO talks to it.

518
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:14,931
Speaker 1: It's like but yeah, BMO does that a lot in Adventure Time.

519
00:36:15,172 --> 00:36:19,719
Speaker 1: football is like a whole character and here They just they don't bother to introduce football.

520
00:36:19,961 --> 00:36:21,527
Speaker 1: It's just like there's football.

521
00:36:21,567 --> 00:36:22,912
Speaker 1: It's like you're it's expect.

522
00:36:22,972 --> 00:36:32,791
Speaker 1: It's written in a way where you're expected to know Football and so I think it's just the fact that she's a thrown there would be might be a little If you didn't know Adventure Time.

523
00:36:32,831 --> 00:36:35,646
Speaker 1: possibly, yeah, maybe not It's not that big a deal to the.

524
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:40,427
Speaker 0: I think what would happen is a small ball shows up a few times or like the things With the lards and all that like.

525
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,452
Speaker 0: there's a lot of things.

526
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:44,004
Speaker 1: that's true the lard Yeah, the.

527
00:36:44,426 --> 00:36:52,000
Speaker 0: this would feel a lot weirder and more Abstract and crazy if you hadn't seen Adventure Time.

528
00:36:52,281 --> 00:37:00,003
Speaker 0: But if you've seen Adventure Time a lot of the more crazy things that happen are pretty mundane features of the Adventure Time universe Right.

529
00:37:00,023 --> 00:37:10,038
Speaker 1: So lards are like these basically heads with big noses that float around that come in different shapes and sizes And they're kind of like mystical and immortal in regular Adventure Time like.

530
00:37:10,379 --> 00:37:21,460
Speaker 1: yeah It's like they have like a. they're like, you know, they don't play a large part But there's still Significant a significant and important presence and they sort of have a meaning to them and they show up at certain times and places.

531
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:27,180
Speaker 1: Yeah, but here it's like, you know BMO lands and there's a guy like lard farming if they're gonna eat lards or whatever.

532
00:37:27,361 --> 00:37:29,711
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's like if you haven't seen any Adventure Time, you're like.

533
00:37:30,395 --> 00:37:31,500
Speaker 1: that means nothing to you.

534
00:37:31,580 --> 00:37:33,727
Speaker 1: But if you have it's like oh shit, those are lards.

535
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:34,068
Speaker 0: Yep.

536
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,218
Speaker 0: Like now I kind of know the deal with large like.

537
00:37:37,278 --> 00:37:51,980
Speaker 1: more so Yeah, but it's like so that the impact of that same scene would be completely different for it wouldn't make it this a meaningless Watch to a non Adventure Time knower, but that the impact of that is like those are lards versus.

538
00:37:52,141 --> 00:37:53,891
Speaker 1: Okay, this guy's farming some space creatures.

539
00:37:53,951 --> 00:37:55,038
Speaker 1: All right, I get it.

540
00:37:55,881 --> 00:38:06,700
Speaker 0: So before we get into some spoiler territory the other notes I could point out is that there's a character another robot Kind of a broken robot seagull, you know voice seagull.

541
00:38:08,382 --> 00:38:12,000
Speaker 0: No, Simone Gertz the woman who makes the terrifying bad robots.

542
00:38:12,701 --> 00:38:23,617
Speaker 0: okay, they she was a huge fan of well is a huge fan of Adventure Time and The creators of Adventure Time were like we should get that person who makes bad robots to play our bad robot.

543
00:38:23,918 --> 00:38:25,163
Speaker 0: and the bad robot Person was like.

544
00:38:25,385 --> 00:38:27,316
Speaker 0: I've always wanted to be an Adventure Time voice actor.

545
00:38:27,356 --> 00:38:27,859
Speaker 0: Oh my god.

546
00:38:28,201 --> 00:38:30,380
Speaker 1: So they time seems to do that a lot, right?

547
00:38:30,602 --> 00:38:36,218
Speaker 1: I think you know John Hodgins been an Adventure Time voice actor and I think he voiced something in this because I heard his voice.

548
00:38:36,359 --> 00:38:40,880
Speaker 1: I think He might have been one of the people fighting against the crab people at that scene.

549
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,851
Speaker 1: Maybe I don't remember but I definitely heard John Hodgman's voice in the in the show.

550
00:38:45,911 --> 00:38:47,876
Speaker 1: Yeah, and also who's the person?

551
00:38:47,936 --> 00:38:48,839
Speaker 1: who's the voice of?

552
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:53,156
Speaker 0: Mabel and oh god, I always forget their name.

553
00:38:53,176 --> 00:38:54,040
Speaker 1: I just forget her name.

554
00:38:55,321 --> 00:38:56,210
Speaker 1: I don't know what their name.

555
00:38:56,251 --> 00:38:57,120
Speaker 0: She's an Adventure Time.

556
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:58,845
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can look it up.

557
00:38:58,905 --> 00:38:59,528
Speaker 1: But yeah, please.

558
00:38:59,588 --> 00:39:01,959
Speaker 0: Well, I forget their names to one of Jake's kids.

559
00:39:03,220 --> 00:39:04,826
Speaker 1: Yes, exactly that person is.

560
00:39:04,846 --> 00:39:07,354
Speaker 0: but one thing I can't say is that the voice acting is all.

561
00:39:07,455 --> 00:39:08,197
Speaker 1: that's the person.

562
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:09,080
Speaker 1: this is all.

563
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:10,347
Speaker 1: Yeah, the boy were not.

564
00:39:10,427 --> 00:39:14,405
Speaker 1: I don't think I heard Kristin Shaw in this BMO thing But I definitely heard John Hodge.

565
00:39:14,866 --> 00:39:17,134
Speaker 0: the voice acting in this is really good.

566
00:39:17,194 --> 00:39:19,100
Speaker 0: Like the writing is good like everything about it's good.

567
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:20,328
Speaker 0: It's a hundred percent worth watching.

568
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:29,550
Speaker 0: It does a little bit of Explain the plot at the very end, but it's so short that part that well That was a big thunder that it doesn't really matter.

569
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:33,966
Speaker 0: Like it's not a flaw I would say It just wraps up like it could have.

570
00:39:34,347 --> 00:39:37,540
Speaker 0: it could have had ten more minutes to wrap up its plot like a little more smoothly.

571
00:39:37,902 --> 00:39:44,925
Speaker 0: Instead it sort of accelerates toward the end and a few characters have their big Moments pretty suddenly.

572
00:39:45,065 --> 00:39:47,253
Speaker 0: but other than that like it's just fantastic.

573
00:39:47,313 --> 00:39:49,160
Speaker 0: It was laugh-out-loud funny at multiple points.

574
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:52,915
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you know, it's it's what you expect from Adventure Time.

575
00:39:53,116 --> 00:39:54,180
Speaker 1: It's more Adventure Time.

576
00:39:54,301 --> 00:40:03,260
Speaker 0: It gives you a lot of BMO if BMO is your favorite Yep And it does nothing to undermine the perfect ending of Adventure Time like it's not like if they just made more cowboy bebop.

577
00:40:04,062 --> 00:40:08,475
Speaker 1: No, no, no, it's it's more good Adventure Time, but it's not.

578
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:10,742
Speaker 1: you know, the the lack of length It could have.

579
00:40:10,842 --> 00:40:13,392
Speaker 1: you know, it's like they introduced a bunch of stuff.

580
00:40:13,492 --> 00:40:19,168
Speaker 1: They wrap up all the stuff they introduce and It's like it's more like okay.

581
00:40:19,188 --> 00:40:20,552
Speaker 1: You love Adventure Time so much.

582
00:40:20,753 --> 00:40:22,258
Speaker 1: You haven't had any in a while.

583
00:40:22,358 --> 00:40:22,980
Speaker 1: You want more.

584
00:40:23,381 --> 00:40:29,140
Speaker 1: Here's an Adventure Time snack and you're like, wow that tastes just like Adventure Time, but I wanted an Adventure Time meal.

585
00:40:29,542 --> 00:40:32,576
Speaker 0: Yep, I just want to know if they can make these forever.

586
00:40:32,636 --> 00:40:33,460
Speaker 0: I just keep watching them.

587
00:40:33,783 --> 00:40:34,797
Speaker 1: Well, they're gonna make three more.

588
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:43,044
Speaker 1: I know it's like it's like you're getting four snacks where what you when you want a meal the snacks taste exactly what you expect Them to taste like right?

589
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:43,806
Speaker 1: They're good.

590
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:45,631
Speaker 1: You're not turning them down, right?

591
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:49,140
Speaker 1: You should eat them, but you still want meal, right?

592
00:40:50,143 --> 00:40:50,448
Speaker 1: That's what.

593
00:40:50,488 --> 00:41:01,560
Speaker 0: that's what this is Alright, so spoiler spoiler spoilers because I want to talk about this assuming you've seen it That was definitely Finn's dad and 100% that is why he's in fucking space prison.

594
00:41:01,921 --> 00:41:05,193
Speaker 1: It is the voice acting of the same voice.

595
00:41:05,293 --> 00:41:08,323
Speaker 1: as soon as I knew I heard of the same voice actor I was like, that's Finn's dad.

596
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:08,604
Speaker 1: Yep.

597
00:41:08,705 --> 00:41:09,447
Speaker 1: Plus it was like.

598
00:41:09,527 --> 00:41:10,149
Speaker 1: it was like mr.

599
00:41:10,390 --> 00:41:13,279
Speaker 1: M and isn't Finn's dad named like Mert Marty or something?

600
00:41:13,925 --> 00:41:16,241
Speaker 0: Well balls of last name friends Mertens.

601
00:41:16,282 --> 00:41:17,004
Speaker 1: that's it, right?

602
00:41:17,044 --> 00:41:18,068
Speaker 1: Yeah plus I knew.

603
00:41:18,088 --> 00:41:18,470
Speaker 1: I knew.

604
00:41:18,490 --> 00:41:24,211
Speaker 0: as soon as he gets out of that car and you see he's wearing those short Shorts and like he's like man spread legs.

605
00:41:24,271 --> 00:41:24,793
Speaker 0: He's not.

606
00:41:24,833 --> 00:41:26,982
Speaker 1: as soon as he spoke a line of dialogue I was like.

607
00:41:27,002 --> 00:41:28,833
Speaker 1: that's Finn's dad's voice and I was like, wait a minute.

608
00:41:28,873 --> 00:41:29,557
Speaker 1: No, it's Finn's dad.

609
00:41:29,658 --> 00:41:31,587
Speaker 1: Yeah Immediately, I knew it and how.

610
00:41:31,628 --> 00:41:32,876
Speaker 0: he's kind of just a piece of shit.

611
00:41:32,916 --> 00:41:38,980
Speaker 1: the whole time He acted like he acted the way Finn's dad would act treated people the way Finn's dad treats me.

612
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:41,193
Speaker 0: I like how it brought the guys in as soon as they would.

613
00:41:41,294 --> 00:41:42,280
Speaker 1: as soon as there was trouble.

614
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,707
Speaker 1: He got out of Dodge just like Finn's dad does.

615
00:41:44,767 --> 00:41:45,007
Speaker 1: Yep.

616
00:41:45,408 --> 00:41:47,494
Speaker 0: I don't know how the plot was.

617
00:41:47,955 --> 00:41:48,296
Speaker 0: Actually.

618
00:41:48,336 --> 00:41:49,500
Speaker 0: These were humans who escaped earth.

619
00:41:50,563 --> 00:42:01,003
Speaker 0: Yep, like that little bit was fun, too Especially because the villain literally is just like an Elon Musk who sent himself into space and is now just fucking shit up with capitalism Mm-hmm.

620
00:42:01,646 --> 00:42:05,675
Speaker 1: So the interesting thing that's it's not quite Completely answered.

621
00:42:05,695 --> 00:42:14,010
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm right if we're going spoilers is you start out beimos on this mission to plant potatoes on Mars and gets pulled away by the Maintenance robot that you do learn about.

622
00:42:14,111 --> 00:42:14,272
Speaker 1: why?

623
00:42:14,312 --> 00:42:15,438
Speaker 1: yeah, but the deal was with that.

624
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,136
Speaker 1: But they don't explain beimos potato mission.

625
00:42:20,176 --> 00:42:20,839
Speaker 1: who sent him on?

626
00:42:21,141 --> 00:42:22,812
Speaker 0: Where did bemo get those potatoes?

627
00:42:22,953 --> 00:42:23,758
Speaker 0: or that was emo?

628
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:30,780
Speaker 1: I was bemo still with all the other Mo's right did like mo send bemo on a mission to plant potatoes on Mars.

629
00:42:31,242 --> 00:42:33,655
Speaker 1: Who would send bemo on a mission to plant potatoes on Mars?

630
00:42:33,755 --> 00:42:34,539
Speaker 1: magic man?

631
00:42:34,840 --> 00:42:36,046
Speaker 0: Cuz this is becoming.

632
00:42:36,127 --> 00:42:38,760
Speaker 0: this is before magic man's transformation.

633
00:42:38,904 --> 00:42:43,931
Speaker 1: This is before Who would have who would have sent bemo into space right?

634
00:42:44,011 --> 00:42:45,154
Speaker 1: It's like banana man.

635
00:42:45,515 --> 00:42:46,036
Speaker 1: It's like.

636
00:42:46,678 --> 00:42:47,560
Speaker 1: what's the deal there?

637
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,626
Speaker 0: It was a pretty good spaceship too.

638
00:42:49,746 --> 00:42:50,569
Speaker 0: Like it was right.

639
00:42:50,871 --> 00:42:51,091
Speaker 1: It was.

640
00:42:51,232 --> 00:42:53,400
Speaker 1: it was working bemo's clearly on a mission.

641
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,585
Speaker 1: The mission was functioning.

642
00:42:54,625 --> 00:42:55,549
Speaker 1: He had the potatoes.

643
00:42:55,890 --> 00:42:56,693
Speaker 1: He was specifically.

644
00:42:56,714 --> 00:42:58,260
Speaker 1: he knew he was going to bemo.

645
00:42:58,300 --> 00:42:59,586
Speaker 1: I guess bemo's not here or she?

646
00:42:59,607 --> 00:43:02,300
Speaker 1: bemo, you know knew they were supposed to be going to Mars.

647
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:06,294
Speaker 1: Yeah, right was headed towards it successfully was into.

648
00:43:06,334 --> 00:43:08,040
Speaker 0: it was like mission was totally cool.

649
00:43:08,771 --> 00:43:11,217
Speaker 1: Nothing about that setup was revealed.

650
00:43:11,337 --> 00:43:18,901
Speaker 0: That was the only unanswered Question which I like because it parallels at the end of real adventure time where you get the final Denim on.

651
00:43:18,962 --> 00:43:24,940
Speaker 0: other than bemo being the king of oohs you get bemo clearly launching that rocket into space.

652
00:43:25,120 --> 00:43:27,011
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm with their creator.

653
00:43:27,897 --> 00:43:33,190
Speaker 1: Yep Anyway, yeah, but I any other any other spoiler talk.

654
00:43:34,352 --> 00:43:35,458
Speaker 0: Mmm the Grays.

655
00:43:35,578 --> 00:43:50,150
Speaker 0: it was interesting in the sense that when Tree trunks is interacting with the Grays later and they're like trying to find a new home world It is very clearly clear that Elon Musk made the Grays turn him into an elf and then he basically fucked up their planet and left

656
00:43:51,591 --> 00:43:51,832
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm,

657
00:43:52,013 --> 00:43:52,534
Speaker 0: like he.

658
00:43:53,357 --> 00:43:56,166
Speaker 0: there's a lot of catalyzing incidents that occurred in this.

659
00:43:57,149 --> 00:44:03,330
Speaker 1: Yeah So Yeah, I mean if you're if you're writing for Adventure Time and you're a good writer, right?

660
00:44:03,410 --> 00:44:05,236
Speaker 1: There's so many episodes and so much content.

661
00:44:05,638 --> 00:44:12,141
Speaker 1: you can easily find a thing that happened in Adventure Time episode Right and then leave it in right.

662
00:44:12,382 --> 00:44:14,028
Speaker 0: don't even need to shine a spotlight on it.

663
00:44:14,068 --> 00:44:18,310
Speaker 1: Just weave it Right, let it you can just and you can treat it if it hasn't been used already.

664
00:44:18,470 --> 00:44:22,864
Speaker 1: It's like you can treat it as a starting point for whatever you're gonna do.

665
00:44:22,944 --> 00:44:28,909
Speaker 1: It's like oh that time that You know, it's like okay that the infinity train episode right.

666
00:44:28,929 --> 00:44:34,810
Speaker 1: well You can write something about how that train got there or you know, someone escaped the infinity train.

667
00:44:34,950 --> 00:44:35,191
Speaker 1: It's like.

668
00:44:35,252 --> 00:44:40,269
Speaker 1: it's like, you know, it's just like every episode is just like a fountain of ideas that you could go off into.

669
00:44:41,831 --> 00:44:43,879
Speaker 1: So that's what they do.

670
00:44:43,919 --> 00:44:57,690
Speaker 0: these side characters in this definitely are echoes of unexplained characters from Adventure Time that showed up in a few episodes like you can and that's You can take a parallel like draw them but like put them both side by side for every character you see in this thing.

671
00:44:58,551 --> 00:45:02,090
Speaker 1: And that's how you do the quality world building and the quality continuity.

672
00:45:02,251 --> 00:45:03,635
Speaker 1: You don't do it the way that you know.

673
00:45:03,675 --> 00:45:07,107
Speaker 1: Marvel DC Comics did or do or still do.

674
00:45:07,187 --> 00:45:07,930
Speaker 1: I don't even know anymore.

675
00:45:07,970 --> 00:45:16,359
Speaker 1: I don't know a new one in a long time where it's like if you didn't read all these different kind if you didn't read cats in America and Spider-man and this and that and the other thing.

676
00:45:16,399 --> 00:45:19,010
Speaker 1: you won't understand what's going on in secret Wars, right?

677
00:45:19,411 --> 00:45:41,161
Speaker 1: It's instead just a world building thing where it's like you can watch any random Adventure Time episode or movie or whatever comic and totally Be entertained, but if you understand the whole world Right, there's just hints and things that will enrich any particular thing that you consume, you know With your additional knowledge, right.

678
00:45:41,181 --> 00:45:50,671
Speaker 1: and each thing that they make while simultaneously Building on what already exists also is creating more for future things to go on Right.

679
00:45:50,872 --> 00:45:55,570
Speaker 1: It's like you watch this BMO thing and now we've learned about this place, right?

680
00:45:55,830 --> 00:46:00,490
Speaker 1: Well now think about how many more stories you could write with all the new things that have been created here, right?

681
00:46:00,770 --> 00:46:02,258
Speaker 1: You could write about those crab people.

682
00:46:02,621 --> 00:46:04,290
Speaker 1: you could write about or you know.

683
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:09,030
Speaker 0: When did those humans leave earth and like what happened to them specifically?

684
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:11,782
Speaker 0: Did they become the bunny people or the bunny people like the original hell?

685
00:46:11,802 --> 00:46:11,903
Speaker 0: like?

686
00:46:11,923 --> 00:46:17,985
Speaker 1: we don't know any of that Right, you can write about what Finn's dad was doing after this and before the other thing.

687
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:22,203
Speaker 1: you can write about what happened to the Evil guy the well the evil bunny guy.

688
00:46:22,263 --> 00:46:23,047
Speaker 1: What's what's his deal?

689
00:46:23,970 --> 00:46:28,670
Speaker 0: I want to say that this is literally the specific reason Finn's dad was in space jail.

690
00:46:29,731 --> 00:46:32,840
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably I feel like that is the exact sequence of events.

691
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,229
Speaker 0: is he was taken to space jail shortly after the incidents of the show.

692
00:46:37,254 --> 00:46:39,366
Speaker 1: quite possibly you could write about.

693
00:46:39,406 --> 00:46:44,022
Speaker 1: you know, there's the The the the non-mo that was in the garbage area.

694
00:46:44,062 --> 00:46:46,329
Speaker 1: you go so you go right you could write about that.

695
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:48,839
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's all kinds of stuff going on there.

696
00:46:48,859 --> 00:46:59,150
Speaker 1: It's just like while taking the existing material They've also created new fertile ground, right which May or may not be explored in the remaining three movies.

697
00:46:59,351 --> 00:47:01,981
Speaker 0: I feel like the three movies will not intersect with each other at all.

698
00:47:02,543 --> 00:47:03,888
Speaker 1: I also feel that way.

699
00:47:04,855 --> 00:47:07,272
Speaker 1: I feel like they will all be standalone Dealies.

700
00:47:07,613 --> 00:47:08,936
Speaker 0: standalone, it's it's it.

701
00:47:09,117 --> 00:47:11,563
Speaker 0: that's the gravel of this episode of geek nights.

702
00:47:11,783 --> 00:47:13,708
Speaker 1: Did you see the gravels that were on the?

703
00:47:13,969 --> 00:47:17,968
