1
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:12,500
Speaker 1: It's Monday November 23rd 2020.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:15,968
Speaker 1: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:16,008 --> 00:00:18,040
Speaker 1: We are talking about displays.

4
00:00:19,552 --> 00:00:20,568
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:29,710
Speaker 1: So as you all know because I talk about it a lot I have two of the same smartphone and the one I had for a long time starting to wear out.

6
00:00:30,133 --> 00:00:31,787
Speaker 1: so I started migrating everything to the new one.

7
00:00:31,807 --> 00:00:41,470
Speaker 1: and the most annoying thing about migrating from any smartphone to any other smartphone is Resetting up all your two-factor nonsense on the new phone exactly.

8
00:00:41,952 --> 00:00:43,078
Speaker 0: So just so people are.

9
00:00:43,178 --> 00:00:45,670
Speaker 0: if you don't know we did do a show on two-factor authentication.

10
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:52,169
Speaker 0: But the most common use the most common two-factor authentication method the one you're used to with Google authenticator app or whatever.

11
00:00:52,189 --> 00:00:58,050
Speaker 0: it is TOTP And the way it works is it's a time-based one-time pad.

12
00:00:58,150 --> 00:01:02,970
Speaker 0: You have a private secret key a number that is in your phone and nowhere else, right?

13
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:04,697
Speaker 0: So it's effectively.

14
00:01:04,818 --> 00:01:11,966
Speaker 0: it could be something, you know, someone could know the number But really it's a thing you have because it's written down in the phone's memory in a special place.

15
00:01:12,207 --> 00:01:25,970
Speaker 0: if you have an iPhone at Least they have that secure enclave or whatever And then it's nowhere else in the world and there's no way to read it out Like there is no function that will get the app to read that number and tell it to anything else.

16
00:01:26,177 --> 00:01:27,694
Speaker 0: Yeah So it's stuck there.

17
00:01:28,216 --> 00:01:36,730
Speaker 0: and then using that secret number and the current time it Generates codes and no one else could generate those codes at you know.

18
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:41,683
Speaker 0: So when you send those codes to the other computer They know what time it is because they're also a computer.

19
00:01:42,145 --> 00:01:47,730
Speaker 0: and they say well They know mathematically that the only they don't know your private key.

20
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:48,814
Speaker 0: They only know the public one.

21
00:01:49,537 --> 00:01:53,230
Speaker 0: the public one can't be used to generate keys, but it can be used to verify keys.

22
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:58,050
Speaker 0: So basically you tell them a number that you made using the private key and the time.

23
00:01:58,573 --> 00:02:05,683
Speaker 0: They look at that number and they look at what time it is and they say aha Only someone who has the private key would be able to guess this exact number.

24
00:02:05,723 --> 00:02:07,108
Speaker 0: It's a one in a million chance.

25
00:02:07,168 --> 00:02:07,810
Speaker 0: It's six digits.

26
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:10,334
Speaker 0: It's not eat right?

27
00:02:10,354 --> 00:02:11,760
Speaker 0: You're not gonna get they're not gonna let.

28
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,390
Speaker 0: you've got a million guesses six or thirty cells.

29
00:02:14,571 --> 00:02:16,960
Speaker 1: It depends that there's different schemes on how many seconds.

30
00:02:17,301 --> 00:02:21,115
Speaker 0: I forget how many seconds that if you can divide the time up You want it doesn't matter right?

31
00:02:21,155 --> 00:02:26,694
Speaker 0: the point is you don't even if you somebody could guess a million times The perfect.

32
00:02:26,794 --> 00:02:29,161
Speaker 0: the system that's having you log in like Google.

33
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:31,990
Speaker 0: if someone tries to guess, you know more than ten codes.

34
00:02:32,091 --> 00:02:33,769
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, you've had enough.

35
00:02:34,313 --> 00:02:39,619
Speaker 0: It's like we're not gonna let you guess a million times Even if you could generate all million guesses that quickly.

36
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:40,943
Speaker 0: so now some services.

37
00:02:40,963 --> 00:02:42,067
Speaker 0: problem is right.

38
00:02:42,087 --> 00:02:42,950
Speaker 0: you switch services.

39
00:02:43,414 --> 00:02:44,829
Speaker 0: You have to get a new phone.

40
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:52,215
Speaker 0: There's no way to read the private key out of phone a and put it into phone B. It's stuck there.

41
00:02:52,557 --> 00:02:55,129
Speaker 1: because if you could do that that actually creates a problem.

42
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,978
Speaker 1: now I noticed my Google auth app, which I deprecated like.

43
00:02:57,998 --> 00:03:01,389
Speaker 1: I don't use it anymore, but I noticed it has like an export function.

44
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:03,333
Speaker 0: now Mine doesn't?

45
00:03:03,896 --> 00:03:04,842
Speaker 1: it appeared that I must be.

46
00:03:04,943 --> 00:03:05,788
Speaker 0: it must be Android.

47
00:03:05,869 --> 00:03:08,950
Speaker 1: only I'm actually restarting my phone to look at it again because I noticed it.

48
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:12,603
Speaker 1: I wasn't sure what it did but it appeared that I would give you iOS.

49
00:03:12,723 --> 00:03:15,412
Speaker 0: one does not have that only the only the Android.

50
00:03:15,453 --> 00:03:18,624
Speaker 1: so I might have been able to actually migrate from one to the other.

51
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,816
Speaker 1: but what annoys me is that Well-made services.

52
00:03:21,837 --> 00:03:29,975
Speaker 1: I don't have many of these problems because they actually let you configure multiple TOTP authenticators for the same service.

53
00:03:30,015 --> 00:03:34,610
Speaker 1: you could then give them names or even let you have multiple options like have a key or your thing.

54
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,420
Speaker 1: Like you can set up stuff, but a lot of people.

55
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:41,960
Speaker 1: you just don't want phone to be one of your options Yep, but a lot of services only lets you set up one.

56
00:03:42,301 --> 00:03:42,662
Speaker 1: You can't.

57
00:03:42,722 --> 00:03:43,565
Speaker 0: even email isn't?

58
00:03:43,705 --> 00:03:45,370
Speaker 0: email is a is an okay option.

59
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:49,150
Speaker 0: It's better than phone, but it's still not great because email is still unencrypted.

60
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:53,927
Speaker 0: So someone who's accessing email servers could see emails flying around see the codes in them and use them.

61
00:03:54,228 --> 00:03:55,557
Speaker 1: Yep And that's a mess.

62
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:56,709
Speaker 1: anyway a worst option.

63
00:03:57,311 --> 00:03:58,034
Speaker 0: So Yuba key.

64
00:03:58,154 --> 00:04:08,029
Speaker 0: I bought the original or one of the very close to the original you because I belonged I was living in beacon And at the time it wasn't actually that useful because not too many things supported it.

65
00:04:09,114 --> 00:04:21,209
Speaker 0: One OAuth service that I used to log into one government account I used it for like WordPress and even though I stopped I my WordPress blogs are still up even though I haven't used them in forever.

66
00:04:22,154 --> 00:04:31,230
Speaker 0: But I did like having extra security on them not because they were particularly Worth protecting but because WordPress is very highly attacked.

67
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:35,730
Speaker 0: Yeah, right, so I just wanted to put a little extra security on there.

68
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:40,306
Speaker 0: But yes, you know the Yuba keys that I had those days were not very useful.

69
00:04:40,326 --> 00:04:44,127
Speaker 0: They didn't use TOTP They used a what's it called Fido or whatever, right?

70
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:50,793
Speaker 0: Now what I know is I actually you're logging into and they could and they only worked on something that had USB port So not a phone.

71
00:04:50,953 --> 00:04:51,154
Speaker 0: Yep.

72
00:04:51,395 --> 00:04:57,660
Speaker 1: I set up a bunch of stuff with my Yuba key to control like Access to password vaults and things like.

73
00:04:57,701 --> 00:05:03,089
Speaker 1: I did a lot with it back then like as much as I could But it wasn't like mainstream like I couldn't use it with Google easily, right?

74
00:05:03,671 --> 00:05:08,967
Speaker 0: So now Yuba key is a lot more mainstream but also so this is the current Yuba key.

75
00:05:08,987 --> 00:05:12,613
Speaker 0: is the Yuba key NFC whatever?

76
00:05:12,673 --> 00:05:19,416
Speaker 0: so not only does it USB, right but it also in addition to being USB I don't want to show the back of it.

77
00:05:19,436 --> 00:05:20,520
Speaker 0: That's what the code is.

78
00:05:21,283 --> 00:05:22,890
Speaker 1: Not that that would necessarily matter.

79
00:05:23,791 --> 00:05:27,890
Speaker 0: Someone could maybe request the same Yuba key from Yuba key if they had I don't know.

80
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:33,070
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is not only does it do all the things the old Yuba key did but also works with NFC.

81
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:36,190
Speaker 0: So you just hold your phone near it to get the code.

82
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,564
Speaker 1: Now older Yuba keys already did that but in the old days.

83
00:05:39,965 --> 00:05:41,170
Speaker 1: that didn't work with iPhones.

84
00:05:41,311 --> 00:05:45,366
Speaker 1: It only worked with Android for Apple reasons that were stupid and those reasons are all gone.

85
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:46,149
Speaker 1: Apple finally fixed it.

86
00:05:46,189 --> 00:05:49,663
Speaker 0: now I think now the newest Apple devices it will work with.

87
00:05:49,823 --> 00:05:51,470
Speaker 0: it works with iPhones going way back.

88
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,500
Speaker 0: It worked with my iPhone 7 and my new iPhone 12.

89
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,306
Speaker 0: It did not work with my iPad.

90
00:05:56,367 --> 00:05:57,370
Speaker 0: That's a couple years old.

91
00:05:57,451 --> 00:06:04,010
Speaker 1: I think only the newest iPads Will do it and older iPhones like iPhones 5 like 6 like it didn't work at all from what I remember.

92
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,889
Speaker 0: Yeah, it didn't work then but that was like five years ago.

93
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,378
Speaker 1: But the cool thing is iPhone 7.

94
00:06:07,378 --> 00:06:08,987
Speaker 0: it worked fine and that's four years ago.

95
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:09,530
Speaker 1: Oh check this out.

96
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:13,630
Speaker 1: So in the Google authenticator app in Android, there's an option to export accounts.

97
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:22,489
Speaker 1: It'll create a QR code you scan it with a different Google authenticator It passes the private keys across and then the old authenticator stops working and the new one starts working.

98
00:06:23,757 --> 00:06:24,300
Speaker 0: All right.

99
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:25,730
Speaker 0: Well the iOS one doesn't have that.

100
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:32,859
Speaker 0: So if you get access to someone's unlocked phone, open up their Google authenticator and steal their private keys Yeah, I don't know if it's a good thing or a bad thing.

101
00:06:32,919 --> 00:06:35,289
Speaker 0: So what the YubaKey does, right?

102
00:06:37,052 --> 00:06:39,673
Speaker 0: That is so great Is that you can.

103
00:06:39,753 --> 00:06:41,017
Speaker 0: it actually has storage in it.

104
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:52,468
Speaker 0: and over NFC or I guess over USB maybe but over NFC You can actually put into the YubaKey up to 32 TOTP private keys.

105
00:06:53,254 --> 00:07:06,209
Speaker 0: So now basically whenever I want to generate codes I hold my phone Near the YubaKey and it's then it generates a set of codes for all my apps And if I don't use the codes, then I have to hold my phone near the thing again.

106
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:12,410
Speaker 1: But what that means, the phone is now just a display like if my phone breaks I can borrow any phone on earth.

107
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,402
Speaker 1: That has the Yubico authenticator app, which is free.

108
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:17,109
Speaker 1: hold my key up to it get my code.

109
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:35,630
Speaker 0: Not only that I can take the YubaKey which is USB put it into my desktop computer Which is where it is And then I can open up the Yubico authenticator app on my computer and generate codes with a desktop Application and copy the codes from that application to my browser to use them.

110
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:37,903
Speaker 0: I don't need my phone when I'm at my computer.

111
00:07:37,923 --> 00:07:39,817
Speaker 0: if I left my phone in the other room I don't have to go get it.

112
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:46,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, even better I set up a bunch of sites support this now way more than used to using the key itself directly.

113
00:07:47,193 --> 00:07:50,709
Speaker 0: Yes, exactly You can also.

114
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:52,755
Speaker 0: What's it called?

115
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:58,490
Speaker 0: What I did is when I was setting up all the keys I actually bought two YubaKeys set it up on both at the same time.

116
00:07:58,974 --> 00:08:00,690
Speaker 0: I set it up on both at the same time.

117
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,848
Speaker 0: So if I lose one YubaKey, I have a backup that has all the codes in it.

118
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:09,812
Speaker 1: So I thought about doing that but it was kind of a pain with the timing and I gave up and I have one YubaKey With everything.

119
00:08:10,153 --> 00:08:12,420
Speaker 0: but I just photographed every QR code twice.

120
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:21,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, I reset up every one of my Backup codes and those those are now secure in a place and I also took my my other YubaKey.

121
00:08:22,472 --> 00:08:27,145
Speaker 1: I set that up as a key for things that allow multiple keys.

122
00:08:27,165 --> 00:08:28,650
Speaker 1: that I called it my backup key.

123
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:31,360
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did that also if there was something like that.

124
00:08:32,023 --> 00:08:41,722
Speaker 0: I just want to give a Sort of thumbs down To Instagram's two factor, right?

125
00:08:42,066 --> 00:08:44,454
Speaker 0: Oh, so The Instagram cuz.

126
00:08:44,494 --> 00:08:46,862
Speaker 1: I know that I noticed someone was futzing with it.

127
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:54,669
Speaker 0: I assumed it was you of course, it's me so the so if Instagram you can only mess with two factor.

128
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:58,538
Speaker 0: you can Wherever you're logging into Instagram, it'll the two.

129
00:08:58,599 --> 00:08:59,782
Speaker 0: logging in is just fine.

130
00:08:59,822 --> 00:09:00,725
Speaker 0: It asks for codes.

131
00:09:00,905 --> 00:09:02,450
Speaker 0: It asks her backup codes, whatever, right?

132
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,210
Speaker 0: When if you want to set up two-factor authentication on Instagram, you have to disable it and re-enable it.

133
00:09:08,351 --> 00:09:09,829
Speaker 1: Okay, a lot of services are like that.

134
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:15,190
Speaker 0: That's fine there's a better way but whatever they'll only let you do it on your phone.

135
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,438
Speaker 0: They won't let you do it on desktop.

136
00:09:16,458 --> 00:09:20,179
Speaker 0: If you try to do it on desktop, it says sorry You have to do it on your phone.

137
00:09:20,199 --> 00:09:21,626
Speaker 0: I do it on your hates.

138
00:09:21,927 --> 00:09:22,470
Speaker 1: that trend.

139
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,410
Speaker 1: There are so many things that don't work at all on desktop anymore.

140
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:31,978
Speaker 0: Yep, if you try to do it on your phone in the Instagram app what it will do when you try when you say You know set me up.

141
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:33,830
Speaker 0: It won't show you a QR code.

142
00:09:34,271 --> 00:09:34,732
Speaker 0: It just won't.

143
00:09:35,253 --> 00:09:47,488
Speaker 0: what it will do is it will look on your phone for the default authenticator app, whatever that happens to be and launch it and Insert the keys into it using the standard API for doing this.

144
00:09:48,733 --> 00:09:54,230
Speaker 0: And I had like three apps even though and there's no way to like choose the default one necessarily.

145
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,609
Speaker 0: So we're like opened up the Microsoft Authenticator app, which I wasn't using anymore and I was like no.

146
00:10:00,913 --> 00:10:02,988
Speaker 0: So I had to delete the Microsoft Authenticator app.

147
00:10:04,412 --> 00:10:07,109
Speaker 0: Get it to open the Google one to put the codes in there.

148
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:17,119
Speaker 0: Right, if you want to use some other authenticator app besides the one it's gonna just launch on its own It won't show you a QR code to photograph.

149
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:25,299
Speaker 0: It will instead show you the literal private key to type in and It's like so to put it on.

150
00:10:25,319 --> 00:10:30,569
Speaker 0: so for me to use the YubiKey with Instagram I would add a type in those like a whole big thing.

151
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:37,218
Speaker 0: Right and it didn't tell me like which Encryption method it was using for that key.

152
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:47,549
Speaker 0: and I think if I choose the wrong and there's a lot of choices You know, they're not just straightforward So I tried to just I tried to type it in once and it didn't work.

153
00:10:48,132 --> 00:10:50,882
Speaker 0: So I clearly made the wrong choice, which is the default.

154
00:10:50,902 --> 00:10:52,750
Speaker 0: I made the default choice and that was wrong.

155
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:00,590
Speaker 0: So I could not put Instagram on to the YubiKey because their implementation is bad.

156
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:03,312
Speaker 1: That is super annoying Yep.

157
00:11:03,774 --> 00:11:12,325
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so I the biggest thing is I did this so that now I am Disentangled from my phone in case I like drop my phone and it breaks or something happens.

158
00:11:12,425 --> 00:11:13,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not completely disentangled.

159
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:24,049
Speaker 0: I put the most unimportant apps and also Instagram still on a phone But I also have a backup phone now, so that's I'm okay, right I'm good.

160
00:11:25,252 --> 00:11:26,720
Speaker 0: So yeah, I just did.

161
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,099
Speaker 0: I don't know if I reviewed the tiny iPhone But just briefly like super briefly.

162
00:11:31,119 --> 00:11:33,970
Speaker 1: apparently twitch only lets you use authy specifically.

163
00:11:34,532 --> 00:11:36,678
Speaker 0: Yes, twitch only lets you use authy specifically.

164
00:11:36,698 --> 00:11:37,560
Speaker 0: That's also bullshit.

165
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:41,351
Speaker 0: cold guy point about me and twitch is the only thing that It's.

166
00:11:42,013 --> 00:11:42,876
Speaker 1: blizzard is annoying.

167
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:47,730
Speaker 1: blizzard makes you use the blizzard authenticator app and steam makes you use this blizzard indicator app.

168
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:53,694
Speaker 0: Blizzard was also what I had a slight hassle with because I haven't even used battle net in forever But I don't moved it over.

169
00:11:53,714 --> 00:11:58,070
Speaker 1: Well, I haven't logged into battle net like I haven't typed a credential in years.

170
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:01,266
Speaker 0: Yeah, I had a little bit of hassle with blizzard, but I got it done.

171
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:06,550
Speaker 0: steam It does make you use their own app, which is bullshit, but it works and is nice and I didn't have any hassle with it.

172
00:12:06,674 --> 00:12:12,723
Speaker 0: so Anyway, so yeah tiny iPhone all I want to say is yeah, it's got a better screen.

173
00:12:12,784 --> 00:12:13,265
Speaker 0: It's bad.

174
00:12:13,285 --> 00:12:14,128
Speaker 0: It looks nicer.

175
00:12:14,228 --> 00:12:14,850
Speaker 0: It's smaller.

176
00:12:15,413 --> 00:12:23,790
Speaker 0: It's got a better camera, right but functionality wise It's effectively the same as the iPhone 7 which I still have and still works.

177
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:29,350
Speaker 0: So like I could have just kept going with that iPhone 7 until it completely died and that would have been just fine.

178
00:12:29,551 --> 00:12:31,157
Speaker 1: That's what I'm doing with my Sony.

179
00:12:31,599 --> 00:12:34,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not disappointed though in this decision.

180
00:12:34,511 --> 00:12:37,350
Speaker 0: I don't have any regrets because a it's good to have a backup phone.

181
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,789
Speaker 0: Maybe someone else will have their phone broken and need the iPhone 7 which is still perfectly fine.

182
00:12:43,172 --> 00:12:47,252
Speaker 0: And also I am hesitant about the rumors on the iPhone 13.

183
00:12:47,252 --> 00:12:49,544
Speaker 0: So it's if you're gonna buy a phone it's good to get it.

184
00:12:49,564 --> 00:12:52,596
Speaker 0: if you're gonna buy any technology It's good to get it as soon as it comes out.

185
00:12:52,998 --> 00:12:57,612
Speaker 0: so you get the most for your money, but this iPhone 12 mini 100%.

186
00:12:57,612 --> 00:13:03,807
Speaker 0: I will keep this until it is broken and no longer functioning in such and plus.

187
00:13:03,827 --> 00:13:07,700
Speaker 0: the fact that has 5g I think is gonna give it, you know further life than the.

188
00:13:08,081 --> 00:13:09,345
Speaker 1: yeah, that's what I'm lacking.

189
00:13:09,405 --> 00:13:12,857
Speaker 1: but until kovat comes down There's no reason like 5g doesn't do anything for me.

190
00:13:12,877 --> 00:13:14,101
Speaker 1: I mean, it doesn't do anything yet.

191
00:13:14,162 --> 00:13:14,382
Speaker 0: Yep.

192
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:14,984
Speaker 0: Not yet.

193
00:13:15,326 --> 00:13:16,269
Speaker 1: I'm connected to my files.

194
00:13:17,472 --> 00:13:21,877
Speaker 0: very tiny thing to talk about is I've been using.

195
00:13:21,897 --> 00:13:28,988
Speaker 0: there's a thing called ansible which is an IT Automation thing along the lines of like chef puppet whatever.

196
00:13:29,008 --> 00:13:35,195
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Some of my developers have been using that and actually so of all the ones I've tried This one's just fantastic.

197
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:40,030
Speaker 0: Like all the other ones were just a big hassle hard to figure out how they work giving me problems.

198
00:13:40,851 --> 00:13:42,159
Speaker 0: Ansible is just like terrific.

199
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:45,535
Speaker 0: It works the way I want it to work And I'm setting it all up.

200
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:46,057
Speaker 0: So nice.

201
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:48,467
Speaker 0: Maybe we'll do a show on it later, but I love it.

202
00:13:48,608 --> 00:13:50,054
Speaker 0: So That's my.

203
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:51,057
Speaker 0: that's my recommendation.

204
00:13:51,077 --> 00:13:56,710
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, if you don't want if you don't want to do if you don't want to just write shell scripts It's a lot better than writing shells.

205
00:13:56,830 --> 00:14:01,010
Speaker 1: I mean, I'm just looking at some config examples and it without knowing anything about it actually how it works.

206
00:14:01,313 --> 00:14:02,670
Speaker 1: The configs are very readable.

207
00:14:03,371 --> 00:14:05,076
Speaker 0: It's still stupid YAML, but it.

208
00:14:05,838 --> 00:14:07,463
Speaker 0: they actually made a YAML schema.

209
00:14:07,503 --> 00:14:09,570
Speaker 0: that makes perfect sense and it's real nice.

210
00:14:09,811 --> 00:14:11,341
Speaker 1: I guess I can deal with the animal like it does.

211
00:14:11,381 --> 00:14:15,326
Speaker 0: I recommend I recommend Ansible it for products of that nature.

212
00:14:15,507 --> 00:14:20,256
Speaker 1: Yeah alright, so speaking of Internet access and 5g and everything.

213
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:25,049
Speaker 1: There is some news from Comcast a terrible ISP, but a lot of people are stuck with them.

214
00:14:26,371 --> 00:14:36,822
Speaker 1: So I didn't realize they've been in forties or enforcing data caps in a lot of places and now they are expanding To enforce their data caps basically everywhere.

215
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:39,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, isn't it a very large data cap?

216
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:41,702
Speaker 0: It's like 1.2 terabytes a month or something.

217
00:14:41,823 --> 00:14:48,816
Speaker 1: Yep, which I have Definitely exceeded 1.2 terabytes in a month many times I think.

218
00:14:48,957 --> 00:14:58,950
Speaker 0: even if you were a streamer and a pirater I don't think you would exceed 1.2 terabytes unless you were hosting your piracy server in your house And it was a public piracy server.

219
00:14:59,010 --> 00:14:59,251
Speaker 0: I think.

220
00:14:59,412 --> 00:15:12,139
Speaker 0: even if you had like a private piracy server that you were hosting for your friends I don't think you would hit 1.2 terabytes a month unless you had 1.2 terabytes of movies and your friend Copied your entire server in the month.

221
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:18,150
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's like we have a really hard Devices and like we're streaming geek nights all over.

222
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:21,670
Speaker 1: It's less now that I know that complicated thing with multiple like yeah streams.

223
00:15:22,252 --> 00:15:36,934
Speaker 1: But also the time when I used to like blow past those caps was back in the day when Amazon offered their unlimited cloud service and I just sent my entire NAS up to the cloud as a snapshot Every week.

224
00:15:36,974 --> 00:15:37,476
Speaker 1: because why not?

225
00:15:37,557 --> 00:15:40,730
Speaker 0: I wonder if the limit applies to upload and download or just one of the other.

226
00:15:40,912 --> 00:15:52,665
Speaker 1: It's not super clear there But yeah it seems to be causing a problem for what they have a bunch of data in the article about like who exceeds the caps and Apparently like ten percent of people are exceeding that cap on a regular base.

227
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:53,508
Speaker 0: That seems about right.

228
00:15:53,548 --> 00:16:03,174
Speaker 0: Yeah You know, I think I guess it could also happen if for example Maybe you have a household full of people right plus first of all people are home now So they're using more bandwidth at home.

229
00:16:03,395 --> 00:16:08,390
Speaker 0: Yeah Comcast Comcast bandwidth usage just like T home TP usage went way up, right?

230
00:16:09,672 --> 00:16:13,105
Speaker 1: The median Comcast ISP usage is 308 gigabytes a month.

231
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:15,859
Speaker 0: That's about right.

232
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,282
Speaker 0: Yeah, let's see.

233
00:16:16,403 --> 00:16:17,470
Speaker 0: That seems like a normal number.

234
00:16:17,530 --> 00:16:18,173
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the thing is right.

235
00:16:18,193 --> 00:16:19,478
Speaker 0: so 300 is like the median, right?

236
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:35,630
Speaker 0: So you think two people living there if you've got a household with several people then you could suddenly start going way up Doing four different Netflix streams like for five hours.

237
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:40,182
Speaker 0: You think you think median the median household is what like, you know.

238
00:16:40,362 --> 00:16:41,405
Speaker 0: two point something people.

239
00:16:41,465 --> 00:16:43,350
Speaker 0: maybe one point something people in the u.s.

240
00:16:43,511 --> 00:16:44,199
Speaker 0: I don't know, right?

241
00:16:44,584 --> 00:16:51,995
Speaker 0: I'm guessing but You know, so two people or roommates, okay Here's the biggest one.

242
00:16:52,256 --> 00:16:52,958
Speaker 1: say remember it.

243
00:16:53,119 --> 00:16:57,877
Speaker 1: remember when we like say four of us lived in an apartment in colony like the four Of us who were hanging out somewhere.

244
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:06,540
Speaker 1: We're all living somewhere in modern times and We all buy a new game and there's an update to that game and it's 200 gigabytes.

245
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:07,888
Speaker 1: cuz it's a big download.

246
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:10,285
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you download it four times.

247
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:12,275
Speaker 0: Yep That's what I'm saying.

248
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:16,190
Speaker 0: So like the 300 gigabytes is probably measuring like one to two.

249
00:17:16,971 --> 00:17:27,970
Speaker 0: Normal ish Netflix II watch II people if you've got four plus big time download II gamer Streamy piratey people, right?

250
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:32,690
Speaker 0: That's where you're hitting the 1.2 terabytes and 10% of people falling into that category.

251
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:37,747
Speaker 0: 10% of like Comcast customer accounts falling into that category seems normal.

252
00:17:37,787 --> 00:17:37,947
Speaker 0: right.

253
00:17:38,068 --> 00:17:39,011
Speaker 0: one in ten How?

254
00:17:39,031 --> 00:17:49,835
Speaker 1: but it is interesting because the parents this article the reason they didn't Enforce these cats before they enforce them everywhere except the Northeast like New York.

255
00:17:50,457 --> 00:17:56,770
Speaker 1: and the reason they didn't enforce it here was specifically because Everyone here has access to files which is uncapped.

256
00:17:59,223 --> 00:18:01,049
Speaker 1: Yep, like straight up which.

257
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:03,036
Speaker 1: that's the part that I think is interesting.

258
00:18:03,096 --> 00:18:13,460
Speaker 1: Comcast basically admitted as part of this whole thing that Competition forced them to give better service to people who lived in places with more competition.

259
00:18:13,944 --> 00:18:14,891
Speaker 1: And now they're saying fuck it.

260
00:18:15,012 --> 00:18:15,960
Speaker 1: We're service for everybody.

261
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:22,413
Speaker 1: Mmm Zoom calls and things like that are also pushing people's bandwidth way up.

262
00:18:22,774 --> 00:18:24,360
Speaker 0: They are using a lot.

263
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,208
Speaker 0: But I've got a kid.

264
00:18:25,389 --> 00:18:26,400
Speaker 1: you've got two kids in school.

265
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,818
Speaker 1: They are on a video call for like seven hours a day five days a week.

266
00:18:31,821 --> 00:18:37,677
Speaker 0: Sure, that is using a significant amount of bandwidth but zoom really is giving you low resolution video.

267
00:18:37,718 --> 00:18:40,225
Speaker 0: those aren't 1080p Those aren't 1080p.

268
00:18:40,225 --> 00:18:41,772
Speaker 0: 60 streams on zoom, right?

269
00:18:41,812 --> 00:18:46,611
Speaker 0: Those are like 640 by 480 30 at maybe 15 frames, right?

270
00:18:46,631 --> 00:18:47,013
Speaker 0: They're not.

271
00:18:47,274 --> 00:18:51,347
Speaker 0: they're not high quality Yep, so the article.

272
00:18:51,428 --> 00:18:53,014
Speaker 1: you can read this article to see all the details like.

273
00:18:53,054 --> 00:19:01,613
Speaker 1: I don't dive into it but there's some interesting points here about how The data caps don't actually protect like the networks in any way.

274
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,820
Speaker 1: They're solely not a monetization.

275
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:08,720
Speaker 1: Absolutely, it does not cost them materially more to hazard that bandwidth.

276
00:19:09,482 --> 00:19:11,890
Speaker 0: It once you have the cable set up it did.

277
00:19:11,930 --> 00:19:14,760
Speaker 0: the marginal cost of data moving over the cable is zero.

278
00:19:15,061 --> 00:19:15,684
Speaker 0: I think it's it.

279
00:19:15,704 --> 00:19:16,308
Speaker 0: Well, it's not zero.

280
00:19:16,348 --> 00:19:17,051
Speaker 0: It's the electricity.

281
00:19:17,212 --> 00:19:17,534
Speaker 0: That's it.

282
00:19:17,675 --> 00:19:22,420
Speaker 0: Yep, right the laser Whatever it is, and this goes back to an original the laser is gonna be on all day.

283
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,162
Speaker 0: So it's like you're.

284
00:19:23,564 --> 00:19:28,479
Speaker 1: it's just a fixed cost basically, but we've talked about this a lot and I'm gonna keep saying it.

285
00:19:29,401 --> 00:19:34,960
Speaker 1: Internet access needs to be provided by the US post service postal service in America and be a guaranteed.

286
00:19:35,061 --> 00:19:37,980
Speaker 0: Doesn't that mean it doesn't have to be the post office specifically?

287
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:49,780
Speaker 0: But it's just like it should be a guaranteed thing the same way that telephone service was and like a private company could be allowed to provide an ISP To compete with that, but it could be some sort of weird.

288
00:19:50,803 --> 00:19:56,217
Speaker 0: It just needs to be mandated and regulated at the same way that all the other just utilities are.

289
00:19:56,277 --> 00:19:59,408
Speaker 0: it shouldn't be like this special service you subscribe to.

290
00:19:59,468 --> 00:20:06,940
Speaker 0: right the way it is now in the US at least is Paying an ISP for internet access is no different than paying like Netflix for a subscription.

291
00:20:07,141 --> 00:20:10,740
Speaker 1: It's a luxury magazine treated like a luxury, but it's really a necessity.

292
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:14,003
Speaker 1: It's as important as electricity and water in the modern It needs to be.

293
00:20:14,043 --> 00:20:17,799
Speaker 0: it needs to be the same as you know, telephone electricity water, etc.

294
00:20:18,421 --> 00:20:32,160
Speaker 0: And also by the way, this is not true in the US but it should be is that if you fail to pay a water electric heating Internet phone bill that they shouldn't be able to cut it off.

295
00:20:32,762 --> 00:20:38,580
Speaker 0: They should never be allowed to cut you off unless the place to which the service is being provided is truly uninhabited.

296
00:20:38,821 --> 00:20:42,640
Speaker 0: Otherwise, they should not be able to cut you off no matter how much bill you fail to pay.

297
00:20:42,941 --> 00:20:43,703
Speaker 1: There are limited.

298
00:20:43,723 --> 00:20:47,555
Speaker 1: there are certain rules around electricity in the US for people.

299
00:20:47,575 --> 00:20:53,875
Speaker 1: if someone registers that in their house They have like certain kinds of medical equipment, but those protections are few and far between.

300
00:20:54,176 --> 00:20:54,798
Speaker 1: and for internet.

301
00:20:54,858 --> 00:20:57,605
Speaker 0: There's nothing Yep, I mean for phones.

302
00:20:57,686 --> 00:21:02,920
Speaker 0: all there is is if you don't pay your phone bill the phone will still call 911 and nothing else.

303
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:14,258
Speaker 1: Yep, also, don't forget a lot of people don't realize this especially younger people if you have an old cell phone It can always call 911 even if there's no SIM card any any telephone in the United States.

304
00:21:14,338 --> 00:21:26,449
Speaker 0: that is like hooked up in any way like op functioning right plugged into the wall a cell phone with no SIM card that still powers on properly if It's a United States phone in the US.

305
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,054
Speaker 0: You can call 911 on it.

306
00:21:28,175 --> 00:21:36,532
Speaker 0: No matter what, right so You can pick up like a $1 flip phone That is 3g on like about razor or something from.

307
00:21:36,552 --> 00:21:44,220
Speaker 0: you know, it'll actually be pretty cool to have a flip Right in 2020 that can call 911 even though it can't call anything.

308
00:21:44,381 --> 00:21:46,510
Speaker 0: I realize you could actually get service for it and call.

309
00:21:46,812 --> 00:21:54,360
Speaker 1: when I was migrating my phone I actually forgot to migrate the SIM card and didn't notice for like two weeks cuz how would I notice?

310
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,686
Speaker 0: Yeah, how would you do the iPhone?

311
00:21:56,767 --> 00:22:04,699
Speaker 0: So I don't know if you know this but when you migrate an iPhone All you do is hold your old iPhone near your new one and that's it

312
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:11,860
Speaker 1: Yep, actually the so androids don't like have the same thing by default, but the sony has one little thing built in that'll do that.

313
00:22:13,442 --> 00:22:18,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, but like you turn on a new iPhone and since I when I bought it I bought it from Apple and I know where they already knew who I was.

314
00:22:18,470 --> 00:22:20,680
Speaker 0: they knew right they knew my Verizon account.

315
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,751
Speaker 0: So they're just like hey Scott hold your old iPhone near this new one.

316
00:22:24,292 --> 00:22:25,637
Speaker 0: All right, and then it just worked.

317
00:22:25,858 --> 00:22:28,747
Speaker 0: the end So apps everything.

318
00:22:29,169 --> 00:22:34,712
Speaker 1: so in some other news we can't go too deep into it now But those Apple m1 chips are out and there's.

319
00:22:35,214 --> 00:22:37,279
Speaker 1: there's a lot going on there Yep.

320
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:47,703
Speaker 0: so the all you really need to know long and short of it is that the Apple m1 CPU by all accounts and benchmarks and things we've seen is Up to the hype.

321
00:22:47,844 --> 00:22:53,440
Speaker 0: it is maybe the best consumer CPU general-purpose CPU available.

322
00:22:54,401 --> 00:23:05,020
Speaker 0: Period right - right short of like maybe some ridiculously overclocked i9s or something with the caveat Nonsense that that is only true just like the old days with those alpha chips.

323
00:23:05,462 --> 00:23:07,611
Speaker 1: It's only true if your shit is compiled for them.

324
00:23:08,394 --> 00:23:08,575
Speaker 0: Yep.

325
00:23:08,655 --> 00:23:09,217
Speaker 0: Well, that's true.

326
00:23:09,338 --> 00:23:18,676
Speaker 0: Well, no Well, actually I saw some benchmarks that were indicating that there were some x86 programs and not jokey ones like even Adobe ones.

327
00:23:18,737 --> 00:23:31,383
Speaker 0: Yeah that Using Apple's Rosetta - right - emulation API whatever layer they have to make x86 apps run on the ARM CPU We're.

328
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:37,700
Speaker 0: actually it's the chip is so good that they were running faster through Rosetta - than they were on native chips.

329
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:41,600
Speaker 1: Now I saw talk of that too, but I didn't actually read those articles yet.

330
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:42,847
Speaker 1: So I'm not I wasn't like sure.

331
00:23:43,651 --> 00:23:45,240
Speaker 0: the point is it's ridiculously fast.

332
00:23:45,381 --> 00:23:56,406
Speaker 0: The problem is as always with Apple is that the GPU That they give you that sort of built-in is not shabby and they have you know All their their fancy metal.

333
00:23:56,507 --> 00:24:00,420
Speaker 0: whatever GPU stuff like you can get good graphics going on an Apple computer.

334
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:00,802
Speaker 0: There's no.

335
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:04,719
Speaker 1: even got the neural engine type stuff that like a modern Nvidia card has.

336
00:24:05,802 --> 00:24:09,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean that's all built into the the CPU even on I've got right.

337
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:18,115
Speaker 0: But that GPU is still compared to like an Nvidia even 2080. yeah, like it's not.

338
00:24:18,276 --> 00:24:25,080
Speaker 0: it's not it Right, and the reason is because the the ARM CPU that Apple has is actually cares about being power efficient, right?

339
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,959
Speaker 0: They won't want your battery to just die.

340
00:24:27,482 --> 00:24:30,454
Speaker 0: Nvidia GPUs ARM, you know AMD GPUs.

341
00:24:30,855 --> 00:24:32,000
Speaker 0: They don't give a shit about power.

342
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:35,054
Speaker 0: Look how you have to plug extra power cables into them from your powers.

343
00:24:35,114 --> 00:24:36,561
Speaker 1: I actually get a 3080.

344
00:24:36,561 --> 00:24:37,485
Speaker 1: I did the calculation.

345
00:24:37,505 --> 00:24:40,900
Speaker 1: I have to upgrade the fucking power supply in my computer, right?

346
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:44,480
Speaker 0: Is there basically like hot rods with the engine sticking out the top of the hood?

347
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:48,019
Speaker 0: That's why they're so fast because they're just like give me that electricity room

348
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,900
Speaker 1: Right and one end there because most people do not need that kind of power and it'd be better people use less

349
00:24:54,121 --> 00:24:54,502
Speaker 0: Exactly,

350
00:24:54,782 --> 00:25:00,739
Speaker 1: but at the same time it means apples will continue to be completely useless for the vast majority of gaming.

351
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:04,014
Speaker 0: if Apple made a computer, right?

352
00:25:04,054 --> 00:25:04,536
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

353
00:25:04,577 --> 00:25:05,160
Speaker 0: the Mac Pro?

354
00:25:05,240 --> 00:25:06,345
Speaker 0: They don't just fucking do it.

355
00:25:06,686 --> 00:25:10,100
Speaker 0: put the m1 or like m1 bionic that they'll come out with of course.

356
00:25:11,141 --> 00:25:13,027
Speaker 1: Let me just put a real video card in there.

357
00:25:13,267 --> 00:25:27,640
Speaker 0: put a fucking Nvidia 3080 in there and that will be the most powerful desktop computer on earth no question and Everyone will pretty much have no choice If they want the powerful computer to do any sort of professional work to buy that computer?

358
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:34,480
Speaker 0: Yes Intel even AMD which is burning out Intel because Intel's in the deep shit won't be able to hold any candles to that.

359
00:25:34,962 --> 00:25:36,328
Speaker 0: I would even maybe have to buy one.

360
00:25:36,529 --> 00:25:39,100
Speaker 0: and you know five or six years from now when I get a computer.

361
00:25:39,723 --> 00:25:42,997
Speaker 0: So my advice is there's still hiccups now because it's still.

362
00:25:43,379 --> 00:25:48,019
Speaker 0: you know People are still recompiling their software to get it over to ARM and all that, right?

363
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:52,459
Speaker 0: The m2 I think is gonna be unbelievable.

364
00:25:53,182 --> 00:26:02,319
Speaker 1: I'm glad I'm at a point where I can wait because I spent a lot of money on my workstation Years, I say if right your current computer hold on to it as long as you can.

365
00:26:02,801 --> 00:26:15,040
Speaker 0: But if your current computer is right wait one to two years to see that m2 CPU come out Before you go and buy an Intel or an AMD CPU or something else.

366
00:26:15,501 --> 00:26:20,099
Speaker 0: Right because it is probably gonna be like think about the difference between an iPhone one and an iPhone 3g.

367
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,576
Speaker 0: Look at how like the I the crappy iPod versus like iPod nano, right?

368
00:26:25,837 --> 00:26:27,666
Speaker 0: That's the kind of jump We're gonna see here.

369
00:26:27,747 --> 00:26:29,560
Speaker 0: and the the one is already ridiculous.

370
00:26:29,683 --> 00:26:34,452
Speaker 1: Yeah No, it has one caveat, but this will not up.

371
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,260
Speaker 1: that's important other than the video card thing.

372
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,966
Speaker 1: That does not really apply to most people.

373
00:26:38,508 --> 00:26:39,832
Speaker 0: the 16 Meg 16 gigs ram.

374
00:26:40,013 --> 00:26:41,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, you cannot have that much RAM.

375
00:26:42,582 --> 00:26:45,152
Speaker 0: You can't have more than 16 gigs ram and you know why.

376
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:47,200
Speaker 0: it's actually sort of a plus and a minus.

377
00:26:47,623 --> 00:26:48,551
Speaker 0: You can't add more RAM.

378
00:26:48,572 --> 00:26:49,620
Speaker 0: You're stuck with 16.

379
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,243
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

380
00:26:50,243 --> 00:26:51,830
Speaker 0: 16 is enough, but I like having 32.

381
00:26:51,830 --> 00:26:53,859
Speaker 0: I've had 32 for a long time, right?

382
00:26:54,542 --> 00:26:57,010
Speaker 0: But why can't you have more than 16?

383
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,100
Speaker 0: because they put the 16 gigs of RAM in the damn chip.

384
00:27:00,321 --> 00:27:02,428
Speaker 0: It's not dims over next to the chip.

385
00:27:02,528 --> 00:27:03,933
Speaker 0: It's fucking in the CPU.

386
00:27:03,993 --> 00:27:05,117
Speaker 0: The RAM is in there.

387
00:27:05,197 --> 00:27:05,960
Speaker 0: It's inside.

388
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:12,380
Speaker 0: It's the fastest goddamn RAM you can get maybe anywhere but definitely in a consumer computer.

389
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:14,466
Speaker 0: It's sort of unbelievable.

390
00:27:14,506 --> 00:27:17,580
Speaker 0: Do you would you rather have twice as much or would you rather have half as much?

391
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:23,960
Speaker 1: That's like ridiculously fast, but there is one thing that it will not be able to do better right now.

392
00:27:24,162 --> 00:27:29,799
Speaker 1: but this is such an edge case that it You probably takes more than 16 gigs of RAM at once.

393
00:27:30,462 --> 00:27:35,680
Speaker 1: Oh, I mean, I've used more than 16 gigs around when I'm editing video and doing effects that I can't render in GPU.

394
00:27:36,663 --> 00:27:40,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm pretty sure stabilizers Like I can do that.

395
00:27:41,129 --> 00:27:59,194
Speaker 1: I have a feeling if you buy like a Mac Well, this is what I wonder it has how we'll just fine extreme high-end Rendering stuff work on this compared to like an Intel box with a real GPU I'm sure it will be possibly if not comparable.

396
00:27:59,475 --> 00:28:00,178
Speaker 0: It might be better.

397
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:04,220
Speaker 0: I can't imagine I don't know, but if you could be it could be worse.

398
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:07,540
Speaker 0: But if it is worse, it will will be slightly worse not severely.

399
00:28:07,583 --> 00:28:27,627
Speaker 1: Yeah If you're doing stuff that is usually only the realm of like Wall Street or like weird performance computing Where the task you are doing is bound primarily by number of transactions per second as opposed to any other factor Like an old Pentium 3 could theoretically outperform this thing for a single threaded Like direct task.

400
00:28:27,748 --> 00:28:38,149
Speaker 1: if you overclocked it because it maxes out at 3.2 gigahertz It's not super comparable to like the clock speed of an Intel or an AMD chip Because it's a different instruction set.

401
00:28:38,290 --> 00:28:40,579
Speaker 1: what it can do with one clock tick is different.

402
00:28:41,402 --> 00:28:51,280
Speaker 1: But true if you're if you're doing very discrete linear non-parallel things 3.2 gigahertz is kind of slow, but it's not that much slower.

403
00:28:51,641 --> 00:28:57,599
Speaker 1: The best in Intel chips gonna do without overclocking it is like four four and a half like you're not that much faster.

404
00:28:58,307 --> 00:28:58,980
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know.

405
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:04,095
Speaker 0: But if you're taking advantage of neural engine how many less how much more efficient is your program?

406
00:29:04,155 --> 00:29:12,677
Speaker 0: if your program is suddenly like big Oh and instead of big oh, you know, yeah and log the neural engine only apply to the GPU rendering though.

407
00:29:12,697 --> 00:29:14,262
Speaker 0: I Don't.

408
00:29:14,363 --> 00:29:16,820
Speaker 1: I thought that only applied to regular units for GPU stuff.

409
00:29:17,902 --> 00:29:21,379
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure it's for like any sort of like machine learning type.

410
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,431
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah You could run machine learning stuff on it or you can run.

411
00:29:24,452 --> 00:29:27,403
Speaker 1: you can use it for rendering because that's why the E80 is so big.

412
00:29:27,423 --> 00:29:30,735
Speaker 1: the 3080 can do AI rendering or like.

413
00:29:30,776 --> 00:29:35,059
Speaker 1: when the CUDA cores first came out You could run software that just uses them to do AI stuff directly.

414
00:29:36,381 --> 00:29:41,200
Speaker 0: But I mean pretty much any application that you have you that you can map to the neural engines.

415
00:29:41,561 --> 00:29:42,684
Speaker 0: You know functionality.

416
00:29:42,825 --> 00:29:49,598
Speaker 1: just like when early video cards and we had those CUDA cores people could write software that would map to CUDA cores And get ridiculous performance.

417
00:29:50,565 --> 00:29:53,200
Speaker 1: Yep, but yeah, this is my point that point about the clock speeds.

418
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:57,231
Speaker 1: But unless you already know that this applies to you.

419
00:29:57,251 --> 00:29:59,338
Speaker 1: It definitely does not apply to anything you're doing.

420
00:30:00,647 --> 00:30:03,423
Speaker 1: Yeah And some other really brief news.

421
00:30:03,704 --> 00:30:11,379
Speaker 1: you might have seen that Twitter if you're using the regular Twitter app a bunch of broken weird stuff appeared at the top that everyone's trying to ignore.

422
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:21,333
Speaker 1: Twitter added a feature that basically no one seemed to want as they keep doing Probably to try to compete with like tick tock or whatever.

423
00:30:21,795 --> 00:30:30,849
Speaker 1: They basically added Ephemeral tweets that they call fleets that you can fleet something and 24 hours later Seen or used a fleet.

424
00:30:30,949 --> 00:30:35,409
Speaker 0: because I don't use the default Twitter app on any platform I use tweet deck tweet by.

425
00:30:35,489 --> 00:30:45,476
Speaker 1: I installed the regular app again And I posted one fleet that asked Twitter why they made this harassment prone abusive feature instead of just banning the Nazis And then I uninstalled the client again.

426
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:48,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, so there is a fleet out there that I posted.

427
00:30:48,795 --> 00:30:49,699
Speaker 1: I guess you can still see it.

428
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:55,640
Speaker 1: Hmm, but I guess I'm not gonna go deep into it because it's not super tech news.

429
00:30:56,142 --> 00:30:59,619
Speaker 1: Twitter's a company that is in the tech sector social media, etc.

430
00:30:59,961 --> 00:31:06,263
Speaker 1: But the thing that bothers me about fleet specifically that you should think about forget the annoyance of them adding a feature Like.

431
00:31:06,283 --> 00:31:07,412
Speaker 1: there's a lot of reasons for that.

432
00:31:07,452 --> 00:31:08,219
Speaker 1: We can talk about it.

433
00:31:08,721 --> 00:31:13,340
Speaker 1: The problem is this is the kind of feature that is extremely prone to abuse.

434
00:31:13,803 --> 00:31:23,140
Speaker 1: I can make a tweet that adds someone and Harasses them or gets my love followers to harass that person that automatically disappears in 24 hours to cover my tracks.

435
00:31:23,942 --> 00:31:25,279
Speaker 1: That's how well gonna get used.

436
00:31:26,083 --> 00:31:31,443
Speaker 0: Right, of course, but Twitter like no one else would be able to see like, you know You like.

437
00:31:31,463 --> 00:31:36,567
Speaker 0: if I harass someone and you don't hear about it for a day You wouldn't be able to see that.

438
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:42,427
Speaker 0: I did that but Twitter would presumably not actually delete them But just remove them from visibility.

439
00:31:42,447 --> 00:31:45,620
Speaker 0: Yep, and therefore could then still find people who had done her.

440
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:55,923
Speaker 1: I don't like but they tend not to and what this means that you can't do is if you are Harassed it is very hard to prove your case without taking Twitter to court To get that.

441
00:31:56,024 --> 00:31:56,405
Speaker 0: also.

442
00:31:56,767 --> 00:32:03,810
Speaker 0: there was Twitter apparently did have some problems where yes You could actually access fleets 24 hours after due to.

443
00:32:03,830 --> 00:32:05,936
Speaker 1: I just saw that news.

444
00:32:06,017 --> 00:32:09,010
Speaker 0: I didn't read the article yet Which proves that I think they're.

445
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:10,980
Speaker 0: you know, like I said, they're not actually deleting them.

446
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:16,538
Speaker 0: They're just you know, basically to change the SQL query is like select fleets where date time less than 24 hours, right?

447
00:32:18,066 --> 00:32:20,280
Speaker 0: And they're keeping all the fleets forever in the database.

448
00:32:21,261 --> 00:32:31,078
Speaker 0: But I think they're gonna fix that query or it's to make it so that through no public facing API Can anyone access old fleets and only internal people can access them?

449
00:32:31,259 --> 00:32:40,119
Speaker 1: Yep so last and least and I have almost nothing to say about this turns out the GIMP is 25 years old.

450
00:32:42,456 --> 00:32:44,330
Speaker 1: It had its birthday today.

451
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,797
Speaker 0: No the cause.

452
00:32:45,817 --> 00:32:47,365
Speaker 0: there's a lot of things with birthdays lately.

453
00:32:47,405 --> 00:32:50,715
Speaker 0: Mario's 35 Right.

454
00:32:50,755 --> 00:32:53,493
Speaker 0: What else is Microsoft Windows is 35.

455
00:32:53,493 --> 00:33:00,850
Speaker 1: so I went and I looked at the GIMP to see like how because I you know, I just use Photoshop since I started paying for Adobe like I haven't I haven't looked at the GIMP in so long.

456
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,298
Speaker 1: So I open it up to see.

457
00:33:02,398 --> 00:33:08,062
Speaker 1: hey, I know it's been like falling behind Commercial tools further and further, but it's real bad.

458
00:33:08,242 --> 00:33:09,668
Speaker 0: How bad can real Photoshop?

459
00:33:09,789 --> 00:33:12,118
Speaker 1: it is unusable.

460
00:33:12,831 --> 00:33:19,189
Speaker 0: Photoshop just added a feature where you can automatically replace the sky in a photo with a different sky.

461
00:33:19,289 --> 00:33:30,950
Speaker 0: Photoshop Just like a feature right a picture of Scott and tell Photoshop to make him happier and look at the looks like People who are like, you know, I don't need that whatever but it's like you don't understand.

462
00:33:31,171 --> 00:33:35,266
Speaker 0: There's someone else who does need that and that's why Photoshop costs that amount of money.

463
00:33:35,327 --> 00:33:36,090
Speaker 0: if you don't need that.

464
00:33:36,553 --> 00:33:38,450
Speaker 0: Yeah, go use junky old GIMP, right?

465
00:33:39,094 --> 00:33:45,850
Speaker 1: But even then all GIMP can do well Like I was trying to use the GIMP a little bit is you can resize images and that's pretty much it.

466
00:33:45,931 --> 00:33:52,988
Speaker 0: I still can't use the vast majority the vast majority of image editing that people need to do normal people on a daily basis.

467
00:33:53,048 --> 00:33:56,798
Speaker 0: resize is Crop resize filter and you know what?

468
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,102
Speaker 0: You don't need to use the GIMP.

469
00:33:58,143 --> 00:34:00,350
Speaker 0: There's a million little phone apps that do that.

470
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:04,503
Speaker 0: There's now Windows like Windows has the the windows built-in photos app.

471
00:34:04,523 --> 00:34:05,567
Speaker 0: It's called photos.

472
00:34:05,627 --> 00:34:07,856
Speaker 0: It's just Windows 10 You can do.

473
00:34:07,956 --> 00:34:10,750
Speaker 0: you can crop edit whatever with that little app you don't need.

474
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:12,105
Speaker 0: You know.

475
00:34:12,975 --> 00:34:14,949
Speaker 0: There there is just like photos on Windows.

476
00:34:15,070 --> 00:34:16,597
Speaker 0: This is Windows 10. this.

477
00:34:16,899 --> 00:34:20,830
Speaker 1: the reason I bring this news up is it brings a culmination something I've talked about off and on over the years.

478
00:34:20,870 --> 00:34:40,149
Speaker 1: I haven't talked about this on geek nights in like a decade But there was an era when like a bunch of open source desktop Applications appeared like the GIMP open office and at the time They did most of what the commercial equivalents would do and as a result they were for most people actually better because they were free

479
00:34:41,331 --> 00:34:46,030
Speaker 0: Exactly open office compared to Microsoft Office at the time was just like put any Microsoft Office.

480
00:34:46,571 --> 00:35:18,369
Speaker 1: But what the GIMP lacks and what a lot of these open source desktop projects lack aside from UX aside from like documentation aside from like actually thinking about what people want to do they lacked R&D and The features that got added to like Photoshop equivalents over the years could not be replicated by the open source community and this argument that Open source tools will be will be able to like sustain this baseline usage among people Didn't really pan out for a lot of sectors

481
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,410
Speaker 0: All right.

482
00:35:19,410 --> 00:35:19,892
Speaker 0: Well, I mean it.

483
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:26,889
Speaker 0: you could easily look at features that that the professional abs developed and sort of cop Try to copy them which is what these things tended to do.

484
00:35:27,050 --> 00:35:30,410
Speaker 1: But they got a point where those features are very difficult to develop, right?

485
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,457
Speaker 0: We've reached the point where it's like, yeah.

486
00:35:32,558 --> 00:35:36,050
Speaker 0: Okay, you want to copy the you know, you want to copy the cropper?

487
00:35:36,191 --> 00:35:36,897
Speaker 0: We can copy that.

488
00:35:36,978 --> 00:35:38,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, you want to copy brushes?

489
00:35:38,654 --> 00:35:49,451
Speaker 0: Okay We can copy customizable brushes and then it's up to the people to make the brushes themselves copy the entirety of the like alpha masking layer stuff that Photoshop does Right.

490
00:35:50,013 --> 00:35:50,314
Speaker 0: Okay.

491
00:35:50,334 --> 00:35:54,244
Speaker 0: We got a copy the sky replacer and it's like who's gonna copy.

492
00:35:54,284 --> 00:36:08,030
Speaker 0: who's gonna sit there and code the Sky replacer, you know on their own for free give it away for free and it's gonna work as good as if not better than The Photoshop one to the point at which a professional photographer can actually use it.

493
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:12,490
Speaker 0: No, no, no, but basically anyone who is anyone who is good enough to code.

494
00:36:12,570 --> 00:36:15,325
Speaker 0: The sky replacer is already working at Adobe.

495
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:21,305
Speaker 1: their archer set sir Right, but and like audacity is a good example of this too.

496
00:36:21,606 --> 00:36:33,790
Speaker 1: It's pretty good or Apple Yeah for audio But even like that all this open-source software They basically implemented all the relatively easy low-hanging fruit and they all kind of just stopped getting better.

497
00:36:35,452 --> 00:36:44,040
Speaker 1: Mmm, and I don't know if open source like desktop applications will ever start progressing again at the rate that commercial software is.

498
00:36:46,173 --> 00:36:50,125
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know - he's never gonna have a real D reverb.

499
00:36:50,165 --> 00:36:51,088
Speaker 1: that just works.

500
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:55,720
Speaker 1: but Adobe Audition literally added a D reverb function.

501
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,686
Speaker 1: I can click a button it removes reverb.

502
00:36:58,028 --> 00:36:58,770
Speaker 1: It just works.

503
00:36:58,991 --> 00:36:59,897
Speaker 1: I don't have to do anything.

504
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,045
Speaker 1: It saves me so much time.

505
00:37:01,105 --> 00:37:01,468
Speaker 1: It's like magic.

506
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:05,669
Speaker 0: It just cost you money.

507
00:37:06,853 --> 00:37:10,363
Speaker 1: but anyway things Of the day.

508
00:37:10,685 --> 00:37:11,390
Speaker 1: so check this out.

509
00:37:11,831 --> 00:37:27,649
Speaker 1: I found a channel that is not what I've linked to before but it's about like civilian like civic engineering and dams and stuff And it's about how this particular turbine engine in a particular dam I think in got a screw dropped into it.

510
00:37:29,952 --> 00:37:42,710
Speaker 1: Well, we do get to see like someone like starts grinding down the gears on this turbine but it's a. it's the turbine in a dam that is 92% efficient at turning water falling through it into electricity.

511
00:37:43,252 --> 00:37:46,642
Speaker 0: Yeah, hydro is really good, but this is particularly efficient to hide.

512
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:53,070
Speaker 0: the side effects of hydro are not energy loss And if it at least not the major, it's environmental destruction in the local rights environmental structure.

513
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,750
Speaker 0: We're building a dam and flooding places and un flooding places and fishes and that sort of thing.

514
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:10,232
Speaker 1: Yep, but this video is really cool because it talks about how you get such an Extreme amount of efficiency from what is actually a very very simple physical device Like this.

515
00:38:10,272 --> 00:38:18,909
Speaker 1: dam is not complicated by any measure No, but the reason I'm making this my thing of the day is not because of that.

516
00:38:19,831 --> 00:38:20,756
Speaker 1: That alone is cool.

517
00:38:20,937 --> 00:38:21,581
Speaker 1: Like this that can I?

518
00:38:21,601 --> 00:38:23,270
Speaker 1: this is the kinds of videos I watch all the time.

519
00:38:23,351 --> 00:38:40,050
Speaker 1: This is like just my jam But the reason I make is my thing of the day is about midway through the video the dude who is explaining it all Like the youtubey person who was like there in the dam interviewing people is sitting in a chair About a foot away from the actual spinning turbine

520
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:41,553
Speaker 0: Mmm,

521
00:38:42,014 --> 00:38:44,102
Speaker 1: like just sitting there like if he touched it.

522
00:38:44,243 --> 00:38:46,129
Speaker 1: I just imagined he would be turned into a mist

523
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,095
Speaker 0: Probably and

524
00:38:48,155 --> 00:39:04,090
Speaker 1: then he turns around and he's very careful but he holds one of those little light bike generators up to it and holds a light bulb connected to it and Touches the spinning thing to this massive turbine for real and lights it up.

525
00:39:04,692 --> 00:39:09,870
Speaker 1: And I had to like a cringe and actually like pause the video to figure out if this was an effect or real.

526
00:39:10,292 --> 00:39:10,675
Speaker 1: He did it.

527
00:39:10,795 --> 00:39:13,210
Speaker 1: He just sat there and touch this turbine.

528
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:17,430
Speaker 1: Okay, that is why this video is my thing of the day.

529
00:39:19,393 --> 00:39:22,167
Speaker 1: Okay So what do you got?

530
00:39:23,550 --> 00:39:24,095
Speaker 0: What do I have?

531
00:39:24,176 --> 00:39:25,690
Speaker 0: so speaking of Photoshop?

532
00:39:25,871 --> 00:39:29,390
Speaker 0: Here's some photographers that probably use some Photoshop judging by these images.

533
00:39:30,531 --> 00:39:39,941
Speaker 0: So what we have here is the 2020 ocean photographer of the Year award From oceanographic magazine the winners and finalists.

534
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,230
Speaker 0: So we got a. you know, we like fishes you like oceans, right?

535
00:39:44,071 --> 00:39:47,079
Speaker 0: Here are some really unbelievable photos.

536
00:39:47,179 --> 00:39:48,603
Speaker 0: I can't believe this is someone's job.

537
00:39:48,643 --> 00:39:49,706
Speaker 0: basically is to go to the.

538
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:50,990
Speaker 0: just take photos of the ocean.

539
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:51,452
Speaker 0: What do you do?

540
00:39:51,553 --> 00:39:52,577
Speaker 0: I'm an ocean photographer.

541
00:39:52,597 --> 00:39:53,662
Speaker 0: That's my whole job, right?

542
00:39:53,803 --> 00:39:54,707
Speaker 0: There's people out there.

543
00:39:54,747 --> 00:40:05,423
Speaker 0: That's their job and here is their greatest works of the year and I think it's something anyone can just really appreciate Unless you were really scared of fish or the sea.

544
00:40:05,443 --> 00:40:08,682
Speaker 0: I Imagine most people will enjoy this right?

545
00:40:08,702 --> 00:40:12,782
Speaker 0: This is some good photos Yeah, but it's the kind of you know, this is the kind of thing where it's like.

546
00:40:13,064 --> 00:40:21,997
Speaker 0: it's something everyone would enjoy But it doesn't really go viral and get around even though it feels like everyone would like it And share it if they if it got to them.

547
00:40:22,138 --> 00:40:23,983
Speaker 0: so stool spreading, right?

548
00:40:24,405 --> 00:40:24,786
Speaker 0: All right.

549
00:40:24,826 --> 00:40:26,713
Speaker 0: Appreciate some ocean Photographies.

550
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:30,130
Speaker 1: so in the better moment, we're still stuck at home.

551
00:40:30,351 --> 00:40:38,270
Speaker 1: I have not read more tale of Genji because I have not received a message Saying that you have read more tale of Genji, but I received a message that you have escalated.

552
00:40:39,272 --> 00:40:39,956
Speaker 0: No, I have not.

553
00:40:40,358 --> 00:40:42,349
Speaker 1: In fact, I started reading another nonfiction book.

554
00:40:44,231 --> 00:40:45,335
Speaker 0: I've read some comic books.

555
00:40:45,857 --> 00:40:46,942
Speaker 1: I'm reading a lot of nonfiction.

556
00:40:47,605 --> 00:40:48,789
Speaker 1: I did also finish decadence.

557
00:40:49,910 --> 00:40:50,914
Speaker 0: Okay, it's good stuff.

558
00:40:51,757 --> 00:40:52,259
Speaker 0: How about that?

559
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:53,082
Speaker 0: How about that dense?

560
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:53,825
Speaker 1: Yep.

561
00:40:53,945 --> 00:40:55,150
Speaker 1: It was uh, it was decadent.

562
00:40:56,852 --> 00:40:59,970
Speaker 1: There was a. there was a punch at the end that it was appropriately punchy.

563
00:41:01,150 --> 00:41:02,264
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's a good show.

Speaker 1: I also will say this I did a show reason celebrities You can't reach.

578
00:42:13,714 --> 00:42:21,303
Speaker 1: we did a show recently on now ricochet the tooth the year 2000 mod to half-life Been playing it off and on on the private server.

579
00:42:21,343 --> 00:42:22,708
Speaker 1: that super peachy set up.

580
00:42:24,053 --> 00:42:25,544
Speaker 0: Yeah, we I'm ready for gaming.

581
00:42:25,625 --> 00:42:27,155
Speaker 0: I'm not working I remind you.

582
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,430
Speaker 1: and uh ricochet is real fun.

583
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:47,041
Speaker 1: And what I've ever noticed is that when Scott and I play ricochet, we've only done it a few times so far One of us will dominate for a while, but then the other one will like remember some old strategy or gnosis or gain a skill and then that person will dominate for a while and we keep like Leapfrogging each other and ending up pretty even it's.

584
00:42:47,202 --> 00:42:48,829
Speaker 1: uh, that game has depth.

585
00:42:49,832 --> 00:42:51,862
Speaker 0: I still feel like on the maps that have an upper level.

586
00:42:51,942 --> 00:42:54,615
Speaker 0: It's like get on the upper level alone Stay there pull down.

587
00:42:55,158 --> 00:43:01,417
Speaker 1: Well when we were playing that big super multiplayer very It was whoever farmed the most like.

588
00:43:01,457 --> 00:43:09,680
Speaker 1: sometimes I'd like I'd finally get up there and you've been farming power-ups the whole time and I Get up there and I see just a wave of decapitating ice.

589
00:43:09,761 --> 00:43:10,703
Speaker 1: triple shots fast.

590
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:15,199
Speaker 1: Just like coming at me like a catastrophe Like what the fuck do you do?

591
00:43:15,219 --> 00:43:15,239
Speaker 1: I?

592
00:43:16,850 --> 00:43:20,050
Speaker 0: Just I stay up there alone bouncing back and forth and the power-ups coming.

593
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:21,018
Speaker 0: I wait for you to try to.

594
00:43:21,401 --> 00:43:23,438
Speaker 0: it's like if you just stay at the bottom I'm ahead on the score.

595
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:23,639
Speaker 0: I could.

596
00:43:23,659 --> 00:43:33,069
Speaker 1: just I don't have to fight you Where there's like two wizards and they're having a fight and they have like a beam of terrible power Just like crushing into the middle against each other.

597
00:43:33,512 --> 00:43:37,090
Speaker 1: That's what it feels like with two powered up people in a ricochet game by themselves.

598
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:43,214
Speaker 0: Yeah I love it when there's a wave of discs coming at me like a whole big mess and then I dodge them all with my left Right dodging.

599
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:45,562
Speaker 0: It feels like dodging fireballs from imps and doom.

600
00:43:45,603 --> 00:43:46,586
Speaker 0: It's like the same dodging.

601
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:47,550
Speaker 1: It is the same dodging.

602
00:43:47,773 --> 00:43:48,645
Speaker 1: Ah, that game is so good.

603
00:43:49,633 --> 00:43:50,337
Speaker 1: Yeah, let's get into it.

604
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:59,670
Speaker 1: We have not talked about this topic since April 3rd 2006. now I want to point out we call you run out of Monday ideas.

605
00:43:59,810 --> 00:44:09,104
Speaker 0: Send your Monday ideas via any of the DMS but because our show is so old as 15 years old We can redo show ideas now and it'll actually be somewhat fresh now.

606
00:44:09,284 --> 00:44:11,010
Speaker 0: also you have to resort to at this point.

607
00:44:11,171 --> 00:44:11,353
Speaker 0: so

608
00:44:11,475 --> 00:44:12,566
Speaker 1: this one in particular, uh

609
00:44:13,791 --> 00:44:14,374
Speaker 0: The news

610
00:44:14,514 --> 00:44:33,082
Speaker 1: on this day was that Microsoft virtual server started supporting Linux and also When we Recorded that episode of geek nights on that Monday We mostly explained in the show the difference between CRTs and LCDs and at the time I was still using a 21 inch CRT

611
00:44:35,530 --> 00:44:35,791
Speaker 0: Plus.

612
00:44:35,831 --> 00:44:38,280
Speaker 0: CRT is still even today have some advantages over.

613
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:42,373
Speaker 1: you want a really really high refresh rate Even the best.

614
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,296
Speaker 0: Yeah, even the best.

615
00:44:43,416 --> 00:44:51,286
Speaker 0: Oh LED, you know LCD displays are still not as You know good in some ways as a CRT is.

616
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:52,753
Speaker 1: yeah Do you want?

617
00:44:52,914 --> 00:44:56,529
Speaker 1: it's a really good zero latency and an extremely high refresh rate a CRT.

618
00:44:56,650 --> 00:45:02,310
Speaker 0: So that's why you still you still see like, you know, Smash Brothers players, right using the CRT, right?

619
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:04,085
Speaker 0: Cuz you know, it's what you gotta do.

620
00:45:05,191 --> 00:45:06,955
Speaker 1: But that changed a lot.

621
00:45:06,996 --> 00:45:09,401
Speaker 1: smart TVs appeared ink appeared.

622
00:45:09,642 --> 00:45:10,925
Speaker 1: There's a whole world.

623
00:45:10,965 --> 00:45:12,990
Speaker 1: I'm looking at two 4k monitors right now.

624
00:45:13,776 --> 00:45:18,690
Speaker 0: Yep OLEDs are a thing We've got you know, and the thing is it's not just monitors, right?

625
00:45:18,710 --> 00:45:23,509
Speaker 0: You've got displays on all kinds of devices with all kinds of different properties and things to choose from.

626
00:45:24,673 --> 00:45:26,130
Speaker 0: So it's just like a whole new world.

627
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:31,124
Speaker 0: So I guess I'll start with the most frequently used display by most people which is the television.

628
00:45:31,566 --> 00:45:32,990
Speaker 0: and what's really happened with the television?

629
00:45:33,252 --> 00:45:35,590
Speaker 0: Is you got LCDs but the OLED?

630
00:45:36,450 --> 00:45:49,973
Speaker 0: TV is like the king and the thing with an OLED that's different from an LCD is it's sort of the same thing Right, the difference is that an LCD is a screen with pixels and the pixels change color and the light is a light That's separate.

631
00:45:50,013 --> 00:45:52,123
Speaker 0: that shines through from the back and then haha.

632
00:45:52,164 --> 00:45:53,450
Speaker 0: You can see the colors in the pixel.

633
00:45:53,470 --> 00:46:03,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, and the pixels do like crystals basically move to change the polarization But exact they're only modifying the light that's coming through from that backlight Exactly.

634
00:46:03,532 --> 00:46:15,870
Speaker 0: So the early LCD screens would have like a couple lights usually like at the bottom and top like light bulbs and They would die or they would dim or you'd have some parts of the screen being brighter than others and they had all problems.

635
00:46:16,292 --> 00:46:28,494
Speaker 0: now when you see someone saying like you've got an LED TV an LED TV is just an LCD with a grid of LEDs behind the LCD screen to light it evenly With lower power.

636
00:46:28,836 --> 00:46:29,839
Speaker 0: It's a thinner screen.

637
00:46:29,899 --> 00:46:33,530
Speaker 0: It's better, but it's just better lights than just light bulbs, right?

638
00:46:34,671 --> 00:46:36,236
Speaker 0: So then came along the OLED.

639
00:46:36,256 --> 00:46:40,890
Speaker 0: so the OLED is an organic LED and what this is is really unbelievable.

640
00:46:41,718 --> 00:46:44,834
Speaker 0: each pixel has its self-illuminating right.

641
00:46:44,874 --> 00:46:55,205
Speaker 0: the pixels light themselves up and what this means is that the contrast ratio on an OLED screen is Unbelievable because a black pixel is fucking black.

642
00:46:55,265 --> 00:46:57,935
Speaker 0: it turns its light off Right and you can't see.

643
00:46:57,955 --> 00:47:03,005
Speaker 0: it's like so the dip on a screen has a light shining behind it at all times Right.

644
00:47:03,973 --> 00:47:11,309
Speaker 0: Even the black pixels are still kind of gray because there's light shining through them Right and it can't block all the light with like a like a lead shield.

645
00:47:12,898 --> 00:47:14,050
Speaker 0: It's just a crystal whatever.

646
00:47:15,311 --> 00:47:19,525
Speaker 0: So an OLED screen the difference between the lit up parts and the dark parts.

647
00:47:19,605 --> 00:47:21,190
Speaker 0: The contrast ratio is so high.

648
00:47:21,332 --> 00:47:22,629
Speaker 0: It's really really beautiful.

649
00:47:23,932 --> 00:47:27,955
Speaker 0: But the problem with LED screens is they are Expensive.

650
00:47:28,015 --> 00:47:29,442
Speaker 0: they cost a lot even today.

651
00:47:29,462 --> 00:47:30,930
Speaker 0: They cost a lot of fucking money.

652
00:47:31,432 --> 00:47:37,415
Speaker 0: And the reason they cost so much money is because when they try to make them at the factory The yields are low.

653
00:47:37,516 --> 00:47:43,921
Speaker 0: and what that means is when the factory spits out five screens or whatever some number of screens maybe ten screens.

654
00:47:44,689 --> 00:47:49,970
Speaker 0: a Percentage of those screens do not pass QA like they're busted or the pixels are messed up.

655
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:56,110
Speaker 0: They're not good enough to actually sell to anybody and they have to recycle them or try again or throw them out or whatever.

656
00:47:56,632 --> 00:48:03,443
Speaker 0: So when you buy a working OLED screen with all its pixels in good shape You're paying for a bunch of broken ones as well.

657
00:48:03,523 --> 00:48:04,569
Speaker 0: And that's where all your money went.

658
00:48:06,332 --> 00:48:06,915
Speaker 0: So that's a thing.

659
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:07,499
Speaker 1: Yep.

660
00:48:07,982 --> 00:48:09,350
Speaker 1: And now we've also on top of that.

661
00:48:09,430 --> 00:48:11,197
Speaker 1: we've got the dig at a 1080p or a 4k now TVs.

662
00:48:11,257 --> 00:48:19,608
Speaker 1: a 4k TV is really not useful to people.

663
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:30,010
Speaker 0: yet Unless there are you have any Yep, and you're using it as a PC And you might be watching those 4k programs a lot, right.

664
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:37,250
Speaker 0: So if the things you're watching a lot happen to be in 4k a lot Maybe you've got you know, you're you're just super super movie person.

665
00:48:37,310 --> 00:48:47,762
Speaker 0: You're buying those ultra boo rays that have 4k movies or you the sports you're watching or like NFL broadcasts are in 4k or something Right, then, you know Super Bowl is probably available in 4k - right.

666
00:48:47,802 --> 00:48:49,870
Speaker 0: then maybe maybe you should get it, right?

667
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:55,229
Speaker 0: The HD PC obviously can do 4k but like I don't think the newest consoles the ps5 doesn't do 4k.

668
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,875
Speaker 0: I don't think right does it?

669
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:58,079
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

670
00:48:58,139 --> 00:49:01,802
Speaker 1: No, I mean most people don't even run their computers at 4k even if they can.

671
00:49:03,152 --> 00:49:05,618
Speaker 0: PS 5 4k resolution guide.

672
00:49:05,678 --> 00:49:06,119
Speaker 0: Let's see.

673
00:49:06,661 --> 00:49:09,548
Speaker 0: It seems like it can do it to some extent.

674
00:49:09,588 --> 00:49:10,470
Speaker 0: but how many games?

675
00:49:11,110 --> 00:49:17,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, how many games even if it's outputting 4k or I feel like it's upscaling as opposed to rendering in 4k.

676
00:49:18,437 --> 00:49:25,119
Speaker 1: Just a change I Watch on my computer with my 4k monitor.

677
00:49:25,159 --> 00:49:26,622
Speaker 1: I'm actually rendering in 4k.

678
00:49:26,642 --> 00:49:27,545
Speaker 1: Yep.

679
00:49:27,585 --> 00:49:33,618
Speaker 0: The the ps5 does support 4k 120 Hertz video output.

680
00:49:34,691 --> 00:49:47,610
Speaker 0: So if you guess if you got a ps5 ps5 then maybe a 4k TV is a good idea Maybe maybe all right, it supports it to some extent and I wonder I bet it can play those fancy boo rays the upgrade ultra.

681
00:49:49,134 --> 00:49:54,330
Speaker 0: Not that I would ever buy a physical media ever again in my life, but it probably can play those I'm guessing.

682
00:49:55,491 --> 00:50:02,640
Speaker 0: See the final thing with TVs that's happened since 2006 is pretty much the smart TV has come to dominate And this is a problem.

683
00:50:03,143 --> 00:50:04,070
Speaker 0: This is bad, right?

684
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:10,949
Speaker 0: so you want to go and buy a TV and like us you have no intention of using any of that smart TV bullshit.

685
00:50:10,969 --> 00:50:16,082
Speaker 0: because Hey if you let the smart TV connect to the internet, right?

686
00:50:16,423 --> 00:50:18,890
Speaker 0: You're just asking for a world of problems, right?

687
00:50:18,950 --> 00:50:25,990
Speaker 0: this is a thing that has happened is because The software that you're basically I've seen a lot of smart TVs are bases Android phones in the TV.

688
00:50:26,572 --> 00:50:31,830
Speaker 0: That's what they are a lot of them and that software is never getting updated and it's easily exploited.

689
00:50:32,372 --> 00:50:36,764
Speaker 0: So your TV which eventually stops getting updates eventually gets hacked.

690
00:50:36,845 --> 00:50:46,190
Speaker 0: and now you've got a TV in your house to spamming Emails to someone who knows what it's doing malwaring Attacking using up your bandwidth that is limited by Comcast, right?

691
00:50:46,450 --> 00:50:47,670
Speaker 0: Who knows what the hell that thing's doing?

692
00:50:48,190 --> 00:50:55,063
Speaker 0: And also the functionality of even the best smart TVs with the best UIs is Basically crap compared to even things.

693
00:50:55,103 --> 00:50:56,049
Speaker 0: I don't like like the Roku.

694
00:50:56,351 --> 00:51:00,890
Speaker 1: Yeah, the UI tend to be really unresponsive like even on fancy expensive OLED TVs.

695
00:51:00,950 --> 00:51:04,366
Speaker 1: You'd be surprised how slowly they respond to commands.

696
00:51:04,908 --> 00:51:07,661
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean if you've got the ps5, what do you you know?

697
00:51:07,681 --> 00:51:09,690
Speaker 0: or a HD PC or Roku or anything?

698
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:24,210
Speaker 0: Chromecast and Apple TV all of those even though HD PC is the one true master, whatever the best one of all those the The the smart TV loses to everything.

699
00:51:24,230 --> 00:51:26,557
Speaker 1: well like the apps a lot of times the apps will just like.

700
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:34,421
Speaker 1: I remember way back when people were using the Netflix apps that were Built-in to or the YouTube apps in particular that were built into their TVs.

701
00:51:34,882 --> 00:51:37,490
Speaker 1: those YouTube apps would like one now block ads.

702
00:51:37,952 --> 00:51:41,687
Speaker 1: Two didn't really like work the way YouTube normally works.

703
00:51:41,828 --> 00:51:50,710
Speaker 1: and three Certain videos that were flagged with certain monetization settings would not show up Like you could not watch them because that was not treated like just a browser.

704
00:51:52,372 --> 00:52:02,213
Speaker 1: All sorts of nonsense would happen and that's on top of all these security concerns and the inability to like update them Or even to understand in some cases what they're doing Yep.

705
00:52:02,595 --> 00:52:04,950
Speaker 0: So the problem is you want to buy a TV that's not smart.

706
00:52:05,131 --> 00:52:06,416
Speaker 0: There aren't a lot to choose from.

707
00:52:06,436 --> 00:52:10,010
Speaker 0: there are some but not many and they're not necessarily the best displays.

708
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:17,390
Speaker 0: so what you can do is either a You can buy a smart TV and just not plug it into the internet and not use any of the smart stuff.

709
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:20,990
Speaker 0: Just use it as a screen and try to ignore the smart part as much as possible.

710
00:52:21,070 --> 00:52:23,199
Speaker 0: Yeah smart part in quotes.

711
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:24,224
Speaker 0: or you can buy.

712
00:52:24,244 --> 00:52:27,816
Speaker 0: there are people selling Large monitors, right?

713
00:52:27,836 --> 00:52:32,248
Speaker 0: So they're computer monitors that are just large like Alienware has like a 55 inch monitor.

714
00:52:32,288 --> 00:52:32,509
Speaker 0: That's 4k.

715
00:52:33,011 --> 00:52:35,449
Speaker 0: That's actually pretty impressive looking monitor.

716
00:52:37,151 --> 00:52:40,842
Speaker 0: But you know, it has some limitations mostly the price.

717
00:52:40,963 --> 00:52:46,170
Speaker 0: it's real expensive, but it does look pretty nice I gotta say even if you're not gaming or whatever.

718
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:55,983
Speaker 0: So there are some options out there for giant monitor or dumb TV But I think for reasonable in terms of saving money you have.

719
00:52:56,063 --> 00:52:59,453
Speaker 0: I think the option today that's available is just Smart TV.

720
00:52:59,633 --> 00:53:01,378
Speaker 0: turn off all the smart stuff as much as possible.

721
00:53:01,418 --> 00:53:04,347
Speaker 0: Don't plug it in just power in HDMI and that's it.

722
00:53:04,728 --> 00:53:22,163
Speaker 1: Yep and As much as I want a dumb TV like a TV that just doesn't do anything fancy I feel like that ship is sailing right now because what's driving these smart TVs like when you really think about it Is that TVs are really commoditized to most people.

723
00:53:22,223 --> 00:53:23,687
Speaker 1: they just want a TV that works.

724
00:53:24,108 --> 00:53:27,366
Speaker 1: when they buy one It's not like they're gonna replace it until it breaks.

725
00:53:27,447 --> 00:53:31,907
Speaker 0: in most cases Until they the bigger one they get enough money to buy a bigger one.

726
00:53:31,928 --> 00:53:37,089
Speaker 1: because yeah But once you get a big enough TV, you can get a gigantic TV real cheap if you get like an old LCD.

727
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:38,618
Speaker 0: There's a whole.

728
00:53:38,638 --> 00:53:44,250
Speaker 0: there's still a whole Culture of people who are just like oh look at my new big TV is like a dick measuring contest, right?

729
00:53:44,551 --> 00:53:49,669
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I think that ran out when you can for like 400 bucks literally get like a 72-inch TV and just like.

730
00:53:49,870 --> 00:53:52,227
Speaker 0: well I think there are actually a lot of people buying like.

731
00:53:52,247 --> 00:53:58,170
Speaker 0: there are People who don't like cuz you know, you're not bragging to your friends like ha ha it's you know.

732
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:00,397
Speaker 0: They don't understand if you're not tech people, right?

733
00:54:00,558 --> 00:54:05,478
Speaker 0: Oh, it's OLED high contrast ratio HDR, but 77 inches.

734
00:54:05,519 --> 00:54:06,606
Speaker 0: so there's a lot of TVs out there.

735
00:54:06,626 --> 00:54:09,050
Speaker 1: I don't know I was in high school.

736
00:54:09,171 --> 00:54:10,858
Speaker 1: I remember people wouldn't like.

737
00:54:11,139 --> 00:54:19,781
Speaker 1: there was an error where people were talk about my big TV but once Flat panels started appearing they talked more about the technology.

738
00:54:19,841 --> 00:54:23,351
Speaker 1: like the people who had a plasma TV would never shut up about their plasma TV.

739
00:54:23,372 --> 00:54:24,295
Speaker 0: that's true.

740
00:54:24,415 --> 00:54:30,130
Speaker 0: Anyway, even if they were saying outputting SD like plasma plasma is dead, by the way plasma, alright.

741
00:54:33,027 --> 00:54:35,397
Speaker 0: So, yeah That's the deal with TVs.

742
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:36,442
Speaker 0: So what our monitors?

743
00:54:36,583 --> 00:54:36,744
Speaker 0: right.

744
00:54:36,764 --> 00:54:37,467
Speaker 0: so monitors.

745
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:39,777
Speaker 0: these days They got 4k monitors out there.

746
00:54:39,797 --> 00:54:42,207
Speaker 0: The best monitor you can buy is the Apple monitor.

747
00:54:42,407 --> 00:54:43,030
Speaker 0: It's unbelievable.

748
00:54:43,553 --> 00:54:46,310
Speaker 0: It only works with Apple things and it costs a million that zillion dollars.

749
00:54:47,252 --> 00:54:50,710
Speaker 0: So don't buy it unless you win the lottery yesterday and you have Apple computers.

750
00:54:51,051 --> 00:54:53,419
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much but it's really smart.

751
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:56,430
Speaker 0: Like remember I was talking about how they were like lights behind the LCD screen.

752
00:54:56,832 --> 00:55:03,117
Speaker 0: It has a grid of lights and it dims and brightens them Dynamically as the images on the screen change.

753
00:55:03,698 --> 00:55:04,561
Speaker 0: no other screen.

754
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:07,388
Speaker 0: I'm aware of for consumers does that it's.

755
00:55:07,588 --> 00:55:08,210
Speaker 0: it's ridiculous.

756
00:55:09,151 --> 00:55:11,801
Speaker 0: So you're not an Apple person who has a million dollars.

757
00:55:11,861 --> 00:55:13,467
Speaker 0: what monitor are you gonna buy now?

758
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:19,510
Speaker 1: I think normal computer usage if you use a work like that like laptops just have a monitor like whatever.

759
00:55:19,611 --> 00:55:28,290
Speaker 1: But if you're buying a desktop monitor You pretty much want to get a 4k unless you have a specific reason not to in the model the case.

760
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:30,580
Speaker 0: So there's a few things that have developed right?

761
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,789
Speaker 0: So you've got the 4k versus the not HD.

762
00:55:33,010 --> 00:55:37,770
Speaker 0: There's even some 2k monitors out there with your higher resolution than 1080p, but you know what?

763
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:41,110
Speaker 0: Most monitors now, it's really hard to get an aspect ratio.

764
00:55:41,191 --> 00:55:43,990
Speaker 1: That's not 16 by 9 which I'm mad about but you know what?

765
00:55:44,170 --> 00:55:48,345
Speaker 1: I had to let that sail like as much as I honestly my whole life have since it appeared.

766
00:55:48,365 --> 00:55:50,151
Speaker 1: if preferred 16 by 10.

767
00:55:50,151 --> 00:55:53,223
Speaker 1: I still think it's a better form factor for what I do with computers.

768
00:55:53,926 --> 00:55:54,528
Speaker 1: I ship sailed.

769
00:55:54,608 --> 00:55:55,311
Speaker 1: I gave up I can't.

770
00:55:55,331 --> 00:55:55,934
Speaker 1: there's no way.

771
00:55:55,934 --> 00:55:58,444
Speaker 1: 16 by 10 still exists, but they're expensive and no one.

772
00:55:58,725 --> 00:56:00,010
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one's making them really.

773
00:56:00,694 --> 00:56:02,010
Speaker 0: So here's the things you have to worry about.

774
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:05,003
Speaker 0: The first thing you had to worry about is yeah, do you need that higher resolution?

775
00:56:05,164 --> 00:56:06,570
Speaker 0: and is your computer strong enough?

776
00:56:07,461 --> 00:56:09,689
Speaker 1: People do not have a computer that can drive 4k.

777
00:56:10,130 --> 00:56:19,366
Speaker 1: In fact, if you don't I have a dedicated GPU your computer probably cannot display at 4k Without either really lowering the refresh rate.

778
00:56:19,386 --> 00:56:25,405
Speaker 0: I have a 1070. the 1070 can have two 4k monitors and then it is at its absolute limit.

779
00:56:25,465 --> 00:56:27,170
Speaker 0: I cannot add a single extra pixel.

780
00:56:27,290 --> 00:56:32,087
Speaker 0: I couldn't have 2k to 4k monitors and a 640 by 480 monitor.

781
00:56:32,107 --> 00:56:32,689
Speaker 0: That wouldn't work.

782
00:56:33,871 --> 00:56:34,172
Speaker 0: It's like.

783
00:56:34,192 --> 00:56:36,419
Speaker 0: that's the limit of pixels it can render it once.

784
00:56:36,620 --> 00:56:41,375
Speaker 1: if you're a gamer and you put your games to be in 4k They will look beautiful.

785
00:56:41,696 --> 00:56:46,058
Speaker 1: However, they use Massive amounts of GPU.

786
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:50,095
Speaker 1: power like 4k is four times 1080p.

787
00:56:50,135 --> 00:56:51,442
Speaker 0: that's like having it you.

788
00:56:51,502 --> 00:56:52,990
Speaker 0: it's four times as many pixels.

789
00:56:53,130 --> 00:56:59,090
Speaker 0: So if you were running at 1080p 80 frames a second, you're probably going down closer to 20.

790
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:00,716
Speaker 0: So I'll give you an example.

791
00:57:00,956 --> 00:57:05,350
Speaker 1: my current computer my like super beast with its 1080 and like all the nonsense in it my workstation.

792
00:57:05,732 --> 00:57:09,447
Speaker 1: When I played overwatch before I got a 4k monitor, I rendered it at 1080p.

793
00:57:10,733 --> 00:57:11,980
Speaker 1: It was just locked at 120 FPS all the time.

794
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:18,161
Speaker 1: Perfect Didn't even like get hot like the GPU was like barely.

795
00:57:18,361 --> 00:57:19,605
Speaker 1: I like barely above idle.

796
00:57:20,107 --> 00:57:24,431
Speaker 1: when I got the 4k monitor My GPU is running like at 80%.

797
00:57:24,431 --> 00:57:28,927
Speaker 1: The room gets hot all the fans spin up and I'm locked at 60 FPS.

798
00:57:31,486 --> 00:57:33,678
Speaker 1: But It is so.

799
00:57:33,999 --> 00:57:37,190
Speaker 1: I remember you came over right after I'd gotten those monitors.

800
00:57:37,210 --> 00:57:44,039
Speaker 1: We were into auto chess and you were like we were talking about auto chess and I started playing and you were like Why does it look so good on your computer?

801
00:57:44,059 --> 00:57:44,963
Speaker 1: And you were like really real.

802
00:57:45,023 --> 00:57:50,418
Speaker 0: and then you realized oh 4k Yeah Yeah monitors matter a lot more than graphic.

803
00:57:50,458 --> 00:57:51,381
Speaker 0: Okay, so that's the first thing.

804
00:57:51,422 --> 00:57:52,144
Speaker 0: resolution right.

805
00:57:52,184 --> 00:57:53,890
Speaker 0: next thing colors, right?

806
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:59,335
Speaker 0: So if you're doing Photoshop II video type work print type work You're an artist of some kind.

807
00:57:59,797 --> 00:58:03,170
Speaker 0: you need a monitor with accurate color display, right?

808
00:58:03,290 --> 00:58:08,748
Speaker 0: You'd be surprised you could take the same JPEG in the same app with the same settings like clean windows.

809
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:13,030
Speaker 0: install Right and open that JPEG on two different monitors same computer, right?

810
00:58:13,090 --> 00:58:16,770
Speaker 0: Just drag the the the window back and forth between the monitors, right?

811
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:30,630
Speaker 0: And you'll see the colors change completely because one monitor is better has a higher Range of colors it can display in the gamut and It's just better at color accuracy or is more well calibrated or whatever.

812
00:58:31,232 --> 00:58:34,761
Speaker 0: So if it matters to you, then you need to.

813
00:58:34,801 --> 00:58:38,130
Speaker 0: the monitors that have extreme color accuracy cost a lot of money.

814
00:58:38,171 --> 00:58:40,996
Speaker 0: It's basically three tiers Generally speaking.

815
00:58:41,016 --> 00:58:48,344
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's ridiculous accuracy, which is like 100% s RGB plus even like Adobe and that's all.

816
00:58:48,404 --> 00:58:51,654
Speaker 1: I can use one of those peripherals to Calibrate it like.

817
00:58:51,835 --> 00:58:57,474
Speaker 0: after these monitors cost thousands of dollars that use them that we would use them at like Pixar or something I don't even you guys.

818
00:58:57,956 --> 00:59:00,386
Speaker 0: yeah, I don't you need that then is like the $500 monitor range.

819
00:59:01,610 --> 00:59:02,694
Speaker 0: This is what I'm talking about.

820
00:59:02,734 --> 00:59:05,806
Speaker 1: The Dell ultra sharp is a good example of that range, right?

821
00:59:05,846 --> 00:59:09,275
Speaker 1: We're talking $500 99% s RGB.

822
00:59:09,416 --> 00:59:13,670
Speaker 0: almost everything you see on your desktop computer is s RGB color.

823
00:59:14,540 --> 00:59:20,546
Speaker 0: You know Scheme gamut, whatever right so you can see 99% of the colors very accurately.

824
00:59:21,008 --> 00:59:21,690
Speaker 0: It's gonna be great.

825
00:59:22,032 --> 00:59:30,050
Speaker 0: Then you've got don't care about colors monitors Which are the all those ones that you see a new egg or whatever during Black Friday, which is coming up, right?

826
00:59:30,110 --> 00:59:31,114
Speaker 0: It's like oh my god.

827
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,066
Speaker 0: What a deal on a monitor 100 bucks 27 inches.

828
00:59:34,086 --> 00:59:34,890
Speaker 0: I'm getting this.

829
00:59:35,251 --> 00:59:36,336
Speaker 0: Yeah, cuz the colors on it.

830
00:59:36,376 --> 00:59:37,461
Speaker 0: They just don't give a shit right?

831
00:59:37,481 --> 00:59:39,089
Speaker 0: you who knows what you're seeing on there.

832
00:59:40,172 --> 00:59:41,298
Speaker 0: So those are your color things.

833
00:59:41,358 --> 00:59:43,107
Speaker 0: Okay, something else important.

834
00:59:43,128 --> 00:59:46,007
Speaker 0: these days I have learned every the details about this, right?

835
00:59:47,410 --> 00:59:49,465
Speaker 0: G-sync free sync, right?

836
00:59:49,747 --> 00:59:52,664
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah What is the deal with that?

837
00:59:52,805 --> 00:59:53,589
Speaker 0: So here's the deal?

838
00:59:54,510 --> 01:00:03,276
Speaker 0: You and the olden days right would have a game and the game would run at X FPS and your monitor can only render So many frames a second.

839
01:00:03,316 --> 01:00:04,482
Speaker 0: It's a 60 Hertz monitor.

840
01:00:04,502 --> 01:00:05,567
Speaker 0: It's a 144 Hertz monitor, right?

841
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,670
Speaker 0: You obviously if you're gaming higher Hertz is better, right?

842
01:00:08,770 --> 01:00:14,277
Speaker 0: Because if you're no point in rendering 100 FPS if you only got a 60 Hertz monitor You're throwing away 40 frames never to be seen.

843
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:16,684
Speaker 1: Yep gamers will make a weird argument.

844
01:00:16,865 --> 01:00:18,450
Speaker 1: That is pretty much nonsense.

845
01:00:18,811 --> 01:00:20,135
Speaker 0: So right if you.

846
01:00:20,155 --> 01:00:25,010
Speaker 0: but hey, you can buy 144 Hertz monitor now by even more than that, right?

847
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:33,369
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can't run 4k at 144 Hertz just saying But someone who's got a 3080 maybe 3080s probably could right who knows?

848
01:00:34,571 --> 01:00:36,378
Speaker 0: But yeah, if you've got the power you can do it.

849
01:00:37,001 --> 01:00:37,343
Speaker 0: Damn.

850
01:00:37,423 --> 01:00:38,086
Speaker 0: That's some stuff.

851
01:00:38,146 --> 01:00:38,869
Speaker 0: But here's the problem.

852
01:00:40,031 --> 01:00:41,117
Speaker 0: They're used as a setting.

853
01:00:41,258 --> 01:00:43,630
Speaker 0: every pretty much every video game has a setting vertical sync.

854
01:00:43,951 --> 01:00:44,713
Speaker 0: What does that mean?

855
01:00:45,114 --> 01:00:46,840
Speaker 0: That means when you set vertical sync.

856
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,224
Speaker 0: you're telling the GPU.

857
01:00:48,465 --> 01:00:50,050
Speaker 0: Hey, my monitor is 60 Hertz.

858
01:00:50,611 --> 01:00:54,724
Speaker 0: I want you to render 60 frames and we're gonna be in sync with each other.

859
01:00:54,804 --> 01:00:55,466
Speaker 0: render a frame.

860
01:00:55,586 --> 01:00:56,108
Speaker 0: show the frame.

861
01:00:56,368 --> 01:00:56,890
Speaker 0: render a frame.

862
01:00:57,171 --> 01:00:57,692
Speaker 0: Show the frame.

863
01:00:57,953 --> 01:00:58,475
Speaker 0: render a frame.

864
01:00:58,575 --> 01:00:59,057
Speaker 0: show the frame.

865
01:00:59,899 --> 01:01:13,599
Speaker 0: if you don't set that setting what can happen is something I saw as recently as Star Squadrons, which is sort of the screen tearing effect where the computer is drawn half the the current frame to the screen and it's about halfway through.

866
01:01:13,860 --> 01:01:28,789
Speaker 0: so it's in the middle of the screen drawing pixels and suddenly the next frame gets swapped in the frame buffer and So frame one is on the top half of the screen in frame two is in the bottom half of the screen and they don't Line up and you see sort of this horizontal line across the screen and it's sort of awkward.

867
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,721
Speaker 0: So the way we solved that was vertical sync.

868
01:01:32,781 --> 01:01:34,910
Speaker 0: right render the frames on time with each other.

869
01:01:36,131 --> 01:01:37,697
Speaker 0: What the hell is G sync then?

870
01:01:37,757 --> 01:01:39,624
Speaker 0: if we have vertical sync, right?

871
01:01:39,965 --> 01:01:41,350
Speaker 0: Why the hell do you need G sync?

872
01:01:41,670 --> 01:01:44,919
Speaker 0: Well, what if you can't render 60 FPS?

873
01:01:44,959 --> 01:01:47,987
Speaker 0: What if you've got 144 Hertz monitor, but you can't render 144 frames?

874
01:01:49,471 --> 01:01:58,821
Speaker 0: What if you can do more than 144 frame, you know, whatever what this does is it basically says hey, you know GPU You're gonna render all the frames you can right.

875
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,150
Speaker 0: just you know, don't care about what the monitors doing.

876
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:11,082
Speaker 0: Don't try to stay in sync with the monitor and the monitor is gonna display the frames properly in sync Right so that that effect doesn't happen.

877
01:02:11,323 --> 01:02:13,410
Speaker 0: Every frame is gonna start at the top and end at the bottom.

878
01:02:14,450 --> 01:02:24,509
Speaker 0: so NVIDIA just to not go into extreme detail NVIDIA does this in a very fancy way with lots of extra fancy features that are really kind of nice.

879
01:02:25,512 --> 01:02:37,946
Speaker 0: But it does it by having an actual CPU in the monitor to do the extra work and that's why G sync monitors are expensive Because they have extra hardware in the monitor to gain these extra features that are kind of nice.

880
01:02:37,986 --> 01:02:40,257
Speaker 0: if you can afford them The free sync.

881
01:02:40,518 --> 01:02:42,167
Speaker 0: what Nvidia AMD does?

882
01:02:42,267 --> 01:02:42,730
Speaker 0: free sync?

883
01:02:43,890 --> 01:02:46,259
Speaker 0: Free sync has less features than G sync.

884
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:49,010
Speaker 0: It is not as high spec.

885
01:02:49,111 --> 01:02:49,594
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

886
01:02:49,816 --> 01:02:51,810
Speaker 0: It doesn't do all the fancy things.

887
01:02:51,930 --> 01:02:53,916
Speaker 0: It just does the basics of synchronizing.

888
01:02:54,398 --> 01:02:58,530
Speaker 0: but the monitors are less expensive because they don't need that fancy extra CPU in the monitor.

889
01:02:59,571 --> 01:03:05,913
Speaker 0: So you can just get a free sync monitor and get most of the benefits, but not all the benefits You can.

890
01:03:05,953 --> 01:03:10,850
Speaker 0: however, you'll see some G sync compatible monitors, which are usually free sync monitors.

891
01:03:11,232 --> 01:03:15,730
Speaker 0: So you got an NVIDIA GPU, but you got an AMD free sync monitor.

892
01:03:16,132 --> 01:03:20,670
Speaker 0: You can get the benefits of the AMD one because the NVIDIA one sort of encompasses all that and more.

893
01:03:21,172 --> 01:03:23,379
Speaker 0: You're just sort of telling the NVIDIA GPU.

894
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:26,189
Speaker 0: Hey, don't do the extra stuff because the monitor doesn't have the CPU in it.

895
01:03:27,612 --> 01:03:33,688
Speaker 0: so that's what that's what that is, it's only important if you're gaming and Such and you got extra money for the monitor.

896
01:03:34,332 --> 01:03:38,270
Speaker 1: Yep, and I do not have that because I actually got my monitors a while ago when I built the new computer.

897
01:03:38,910 --> 01:03:46,566
Speaker 0: My my plan actually is when I eventually do get new monitors whenever the hell that is could be a year from now You've got one of my old monitors.

898
01:03:46,626 --> 01:03:50,670
Speaker 0: right now I'm gonna get one monitor that doesn't care about frame rate.

899
01:03:50,690 --> 01:03:55,990
Speaker 0: That's all about color right like a $500 color fancy monitor and then a second monitor.

900
01:03:56,050 --> 01:03:59,110
Speaker 0: That's the gaming monitor with the free sync G sync, right?

901
01:03:59,530 --> 01:04:08,165
Speaker 0: You know not maybe not caring about color so much getting the high frame rates 144 or more And hopefully both of them will be 4k and that'll be the limit of my GPU

902
01:04:08,185 --> 01:04:13,790
Speaker 1: now for me in terms of screen size I actually 27 inches feels like the sweet spot for like desktop like the kind of work.

903
01:04:13,790 --> 01:04:20,690
Speaker 0: 27 I think is the C 24 but I have 16 by 10. if it's 27 then it could be 16 by 9.

904
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:23,683
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like, you know, but bigger than that.

905
01:04:23,743 --> 01:04:25,450
Speaker 0: It's like that's a television that doesn't go on.

906
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:27,644
Speaker 0: I see people who got these televisions on their desk.

907
01:04:27,684 --> 01:04:28,690
Speaker 0: It's like no, what are you doing?

908
01:04:29,050 --> 01:04:30,676
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is that is not.

909
01:04:30,877 --> 01:04:34,190
Speaker 0: that is not right unless you've got eye problems or some other reason that makes sense.

910
01:04:34,563 --> 01:04:47,324
Speaker 1: Yeah now one thing I think about too is one of the real benefits of 4k on the desktop like when you go to 4k outside of gaming where if you don't Have a great GPU you can still tell your games to render in 1080p.

911
01:04:47,364 --> 01:04:48,448
Speaker 1: That's what I do for Star Wars.

912
01:04:48,529 --> 01:04:49,775
Speaker 0: actually Yep.

913
01:04:49,816 --> 01:04:50,137
Speaker 0: Yep.

914
01:04:50,198 --> 01:04:51,224
Speaker 0: I do that for some games.

915
01:04:51,244 --> 01:04:51,365
Speaker 0: Yeah.

916
01:04:51,486 --> 01:04:59,969
Speaker 1: Yep, but Texts will be surprisingly legible at very small physical sizes with a 4k monitor.

917
01:05:01,872 --> 01:05:08,515
Speaker 1: That is the thing you might not realize that you might think oh my text will all be tiny but it'll be Crystal-clear when it's tiny.

918
01:05:08,536 --> 01:05:21,590
Speaker 1: Yep and windows at least like it used to not work that great But like high resolution monitors used to have used to have a lot of problems on Windows But that's pretty much all gone now and you can set the scaling factor in Windows.

919
01:05:21,610 --> 01:05:31,290
Speaker 1: a lot of people don't think to do this and you can set it to like a hundred and twenty five or a hundred and Fifty percent where you still want your computer to output to your monitor at its native resolution.

920
01:05:31,793 --> 01:05:32,658
Speaker 1: Very rarely.

921
01:05:32,678 --> 01:05:34,670
Speaker 1: Do you want to output at any other resolution?

922
01:05:35,150 --> 01:05:40,370
Speaker 1: You can theoretically do like a perfect half or quarter, but that's not an ideal solution.

923
01:05:40,390 --> 01:05:54,941
Speaker 1: You're better off always sending data to your monitor at its native resolution so 3840 by like 2160 and then tell Windows to scale up all the like Interface stuff by 50%.

924
01:05:54,941 --> 01:05:56,186
Speaker 1: so text will be a little bit.

925
01:05:56,347 --> 01:05:58,716
Speaker 0: Alright, you know My resolution is twice as high.

926
01:05:58,776 --> 01:06:00,261
Speaker 0: make my icons twice as big.

927
01:06:00,322 --> 01:06:02,610
Speaker 0: make my text font my text size twice as big.

928
01:06:02,711 --> 01:06:05,150
Speaker 0: I just mean it's like oh and now everything looks great.

929
01:06:06,332 --> 01:06:08,683
Speaker 1: Yeah, and that really just comes down to how are your eyes?

930
01:06:08,724 --> 01:06:09,910
Speaker 1: How are you using the computer?

931
01:06:10,371 --> 01:06:14,706
Speaker 1: I've seen some people that they have the big TV monitor because they sit pretty far away from it.

932
01:06:14,746 --> 01:06:15,849
Speaker 1: the way they've set up their desk.

933
01:06:17,271 --> 01:06:18,241
Speaker 0: Mmm, that could work.

934
01:06:18,423 --> 01:06:23,704
Speaker 1: Yeah Of the Dell ultra sharp like U2718Q.

935
01:06:23,744 --> 01:06:29,124
Speaker 0: if you want a cheap pretty color I do like them because this applies to the TVs and the monitors.

936
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:30,910
Speaker 0: just how many connectors are on there, right?

937
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:31,955
Speaker 0: It's like if you're not a nerd.

938
01:06:31,995 --> 01:06:32,920
Speaker 0: you probably don't care you just need.

939
01:06:33,081 --> 01:06:34,810
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, we should talk about this really briefly.

940
01:06:34,932 --> 01:06:35,968
Speaker 1: I think we talked about it before.

941
01:06:36,652 --> 01:06:38,499
Speaker 1: Modern TVs still just HDMI.

942
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:38,900
Speaker 1: That's it.

943
01:06:39,362 --> 01:06:41,490
Speaker 1: But monitors take display port.

944
01:06:42,391 --> 01:06:43,615
Speaker 1: Uh a lot.

945
01:06:43,675 --> 01:06:46,784
Speaker 1: do not buy generic display port cables for reasons.

946
01:06:46,824 --> 01:06:47,547
Speaker 1: I don't want to get into.

947
01:06:47,607 --> 01:06:48,329
Speaker 1: you can google it.

948
01:06:49,651 --> 01:06:56,697
Speaker 1: most display port cables, especially if they're generic or cheap will have Wires in them that are not supposed to be there.

949
01:06:56,757 --> 01:07:08,887
Speaker 1: that will literally fry either your GPU or your monitor or both possibly Mmm, like just go read about display port cables and do not buy like Amazon generic or whatever.

950
01:07:08,947 --> 01:07:09,649
Speaker 1: you'll have a problem.

951
01:07:11,391 --> 01:07:18,717
Speaker 0: Okay, I wanted to talk about displays and like phones tablets and that We'll talk about a little bit I guess because we're going long.

952
01:07:18,737 --> 01:07:25,090
Speaker 0: but basically yeah most of the phones these days have you know The same sort of thing that's going on with monitors.

953
01:07:25,130 --> 01:07:27,010
Speaker 0: They're like really high resolution screens.

954
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:31,930
Speaker 0: A lot of all the best ones are oleds because even those those oleds are expensive on the tv side.

955
01:07:32,271 --> 01:07:37,174
Speaker 0: They're still expensive on the phone side, but they're so much smaller that you know And they can make more.

956
01:07:37,295 --> 01:07:38,781
Speaker 0: it seems to make a smaller one, right?

957
01:07:39,363 --> 01:07:40,729
Speaker 0: It doesn't cost as much as a giant one.

958
01:07:41,851 --> 01:07:46,666
Speaker 0: Uh, it's like, you know, this new iphone has like a you know, super amazing oled screen in it.

959
01:07:46,746 --> 01:07:47,629
Speaker 0: It's like unbelievable.

960
01:07:47,749 --> 01:07:55,030
Speaker 0: Yeah Uh, some of the android phones have super high refresh rate screens like some of those samsung galaxy ones and that's pretty nice, too.

961
01:07:55,130 --> 01:07:59,897
Speaker 0: I think the iphone refresh rate is actually maybe the one area It's still behind in terms of.

962
01:08:00,399 --> 01:08:01,403
Speaker 0: I guess they didn't feel the need.

963
01:08:01,423 --> 01:08:02,970
Speaker 0: they're like, yeah, they were like why I don't know.

964
01:08:03,130 --> 01:08:06,850
Speaker 1: I mean i'm good with like a 720p cell phone because maybe it saves battery.

965
01:08:07,332 --> 01:08:10,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe it's yeah, maybe it saves battery to have a lower refresh rate on the screen.

966
01:08:10,567 --> 01:08:12,581
Speaker 0: I don't know Uh, but yeah, those are.

967
01:08:12,702 --> 01:08:13,709
Speaker 0: that's what's going on there.

968
01:08:14,512 --> 01:08:20,470
Speaker 0: It's still oleds regular leds that sort of thing, you know, it's the same technology that we were just talking about only smaller.

969
01:08:21,594 --> 01:08:34,609
Speaker 0: Uh, there are all sorts of other display technologies like e-ink Yeah, like e-inks and those sorts of things, uh, you know old ips screens these older technologies They've been around a long time but miniaturization has happened.

970
01:08:35,011 --> 01:08:38,563
Speaker 0: So you see a lot in the hacking modding communities like.

971
01:08:38,582 --> 01:08:52,970
Speaker 0: you can buy now an e-ink display Of many varieties to go with a raspberry pi and it's like any shape size Sets of colors different properties, so, you know, there's like so many choices at reasonable prices.

972
01:08:53,732 --> 01:08:58,064
Speaker 0: Uh, there are ips screens like old, you know, like tiny lcd's.

973
01:08:58,124 --> 01:09:00,250
Speaker 0: I put one in my gameboy advance, right?

974
01:09:00,370 --> 01:09:02,502
Speaker 0: It's unbelievable this screen that you can put in there.

975
01:09:02,522 --> 01:09:02,563
Speaker 0: Um.

976
01:09:04,151 --> 01:09:10,500
Speaker 0: So for handheld portable devices like the kinds of screens you can just buy a screen like to mod into your project.

977
01:09:10,761 --> 01:09:13,752
Speaker 0: the choices now are really Like you're.

978
01:09:13,832 --> 01:09:19,849
Speaker 0: you're basically getting like best possible monitor from 10 years ago in a really tiny tiny space.

979
01:09:19,910 --> 01:09:22,828
Speaker 0: now Uh, like choose your resolution choose your size.

980
01:09:23,551 --> 01:09:27,281
Speaker 0: It low power right super bright super nice colors.

981
01:09:27,321 --> 01:09:34,389
Speaker 0: They might not be accurate colors, but they'll be nice looking Right, uh way better than what else you're going to get at that size.

982
01:09:35,032 --> 01:09:44,390
Speaker 0: So it's just there's a lot of activity going on in that realm even though that's not The highest end realm of displays that people think about the most which is you know televisions monitors.

983
01:09:44,872 --> 01:09:48,029
Speaker 0: There's still a lot of activity happening in the tiny display zone.

984
01:09:48,992 --> 01:09:52,149
Speaker 0: Uh in terms of using older technologies better smaller.

985
01:09:52,169 --> 01:09:58,489
Speaker 1: Yep I still think there's a lot of cool uses for e-ink that are just around the corner because it uses so little power.

986
01:09:59,491 --> 01:10:03,287
Speaker 0: Yep, because it only refreshes we need to refresh it and they've got some that are like partial refresh.

987
01:10:03,307 --> 01:10:07,246
Speaker 0: where you're like Okay, you've got you're reading an e-book reader, right?

988
01:10:07,488 --> 01:10:10,229
Speaker 0: It's like okay You've got your words here and the top left is a clock.

989
01:10:10,742 --> 01:10:11,612
Speaker 0: So, okay We need to read.

990
01:10:11,713 --> 01:10:15,890
Speaker 0: we're not going to redraw the screen every second or every minute because the clock is on the screen.

991
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:19,068
Speaker 0: We'll just refresh the tiny part of the screen that has the clock on it.

992
01:10:19,209 --> 01:10:23,229
Speaker 0: only All right, and then if you turn the page, okay, we'll refresh the whole screen now, right?

993
01:10:23,890 --> 01:10:25,423
Speaker 0: And save a lot of power that way.

994
01:10:25,484 --> 01:10:26,230
Speaker 0: It's it's real nice.

995
01:10:27,341 --> 01:10:40,763
Speaker 1: um Yeah, but the cool thing is if you're in the market to buy a new monitor at least Uh, if you don't need something very specific and fancy you can get Real good 4k monitors for pretty cheap.

996
01:10:40,864 --> 01:10:49,881
Speaker 1: Like they're not going to be super color correct They might only have a 60 fp like a frame refresh rate 60 hertz But they're way better than an lcd.

997
01:10:49,901 --> 01:10:51,770
Speaker 1: you would have gotten even five six years ago.

998
01:10:51,971 --> 01:10:55,264
Speaker 0: Yeah, I remember the one thing I forgot to talk about that.

999
01:10:55,345 --> 01:10:55,786
Speaker 0: we can end this.

1000
01:10:55,867 --> 01:10:56,825
Speaker 0: we can end on this All right.

1001
01:10:56,890 --> 01:11:00,264
Speaker 0: There's a couple trends that are going on in monitor realm that we haven't talked about.

1002
01:11:00,305 --> 01:11:02,753
Speaker 0: the first trend is the curved Display trend.

1003
01:11:02,894 --> 01:11:08,170
Speaker 1: I am theoretically a fan of that but every curved display i've seen is a really low resolution screen.

1004
01:11:09,051 --> 01:11:09,512
Speaker 0: I agree.

1005
01:11:09,652 --> 01:11:16,655
Speaker 0: I've used i've seen curved resolution displays, especially at packs as like demo machines and The curve.

1006
01:11:16,776 --> 01:11:19,250
Speaker 0: it's like you think it's a gimmick, but it's actually kind of nice.

1007
01:11:19,410 --> 01:11:25,149
Speaker 1: It's real nice if your monitor's big like 27 inch or bigger like that's real nice Like there's something to it.

1008
01:11:25,250 --> 01:11:30,158
Speaker 0: Like it's like you sit in front of the curved screen and it's like, you know It doesn't feel like awkward at all.

1009
01:11:30,218 --> 01:11:31,503
Speaker 0: It just it's like it.

1010
01:11:31,543 --> 01:11:38,559
Speaker 0: actually, you know, it's sort of like easier It just I don't know if there's like a science behind it But it's sort of one of those things where it's like.

1011
01:11:38,620 --> 01:11:39,824
Speaker 0: it could just be bs.

1012
01:11:39,884 --> 01:11:46,006
Speaker 0: It could just be psychological Where it's like, oh, yes, my split keyboard in my dvorak layout is better.

1013
01:11:46,107 --> 01:11:46,890
Speaker 0: It feels better.

1014
01:11:47,031 --> 01:11:47,858
Speaker 0: I can't explain it.

1015
01:11:47,899 --> 01:11:49,190
Speaker 0: There's no science behind it, right?

1016
01:11:49,550 --> 01:11:51,216
Speaker 0: the curved monitor is the same way.

1017
01:11:51,276 --> 01:12:00,750
Speaker 0: where it's like it just feels nice like you stand in front of them and it just like Feels nice the way like a nicer carpet just feels nicer than a rough carpet, right?

1018
01:12:00,930 --> 01:12:01,695
Speaker 0: You know, there's something there.

1019
01:12:02,017 --> 01:12:15,690
Speaker 0: the second trend that's going on in monitor land Is the combined monitors right where you'll get a display that is mega big like instead of being 1920 by 1080 What's 1920 times 2 like 4000?

1020
01:12:15,690 --> 01:12:17,812
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's not like two separate monitors It's just it.

1021
01:12:17,852 --> 01:12:20,929
Speaker 1: basically like you're almost outputting two different monitors to one physical device.

1022
01:12:21,471 --> 01:12:31,450
Speaker 0: Some sometimes you do have to plug in like two hdmi cables, but it's basically one big ass screen or One package that has secretly two screens in it.

1023
01:12:31,530 --> 01:12:34,923
Speaker 0: But in the middle, they're just right next to each other literally next to each other.

1024
01:12:34,984 --> 01:12:40,904
Speaker 0: So it might as well be one Extra wide screen or sometimes even extra tall.

1025
01:12:40,984 --> 01:12:46,584
Speaker 0: i've seen screens where it's like, yeah It's extra big but you're actually splitting up this one.

1026
01:12:46,804 --> 01:12:51,196
Speaker 0: What looks to you to be one Screen Splitting it up four ways.

1027
01:12:51,457 --> 01:12:54,109
Speaker 0: plug in four hdmi cables and show four different things.

1028
01:12:54,612 --> 01:13:00,577
Speaker 0: Rather than buying four monitors you buy one giant monitor and show four things on it Like a video wall almost.

1029
01:13:00,617 --> 01:13:00,838
Speaker 1: Yep.

1030
01:13:01,239 --> 01:13:11,150
Speaker 1: Now on one hand I can see a time and a place for that kind of thing but most of the ones i've seen are also Actually either pretty low resolution or have a lot of weird drawbacks.

1031
01:13:11,592 --> 01:13:17,418
Speaker 1: The other problem is if you don't live somewhere where you can have a big spacious desk That might not fit anywhere.

1032
01:13:17,438 --> 01:13:19,869
Speaker 1: like I could not put a monitor like that on this desk.

1033
01:13:20,752 --> 01:13:23,530
Speaker 0: Well, it's like and also just my personal workflow, right?

1034
01:13:23,650 --> 01:13:28,258
Speaker 0: Having one even if I could just combine both of my monitors into one monitor That was I guess what I have.

1035
01:13:28,258 --> 01:13:28,560
Speaker 0: 1920 by 1200 now time.

1036
01:13:29,890 --> 01:13:36,956
Speaker 1: Well, like if it's one big monitor and you tell a game to go full screen a lot of games do not have that aspect Ratio and there's all sorts of fuck-ups that happen.

1037
01:13:37,377 --> 01:13:41,850
Speaker 1: or they're playing on counter strike on like half of a monitor and that just feels weird.

1038
01:13:42,812 --> 01:13:43,497
Speaker 0: Yeah, so 3840 by 1200 it's like.

1039
01:13:45,873 --> 01:13:53,310
Speaker 0: It's like that's actually worse for me to combine these two screens Like I keep something on the right and something on the left and they're separated, right?

1040
01:13:53,510 --> 01:14:02,470
Speaker 0: So putting them in one screen the major benefit is really a few Applications like games that will spread their way across right?

1041
01:14:02,570 --> 01:14:04,142
Speaker 0: It's like star wars could be pretty good.

1042
01:14:04,162 --> 01:14:08,350
Speaker 0: if you're not doing vr And you do it on the big wide screen that could be pretty nice, right?

1043
01:14:08,471 --> 01:14:09,557
Speaker 0: It's extra wide.

1044
01:14:09,577 --> 01:14:12,010
Speaker 0: you see a lot to the left a lot to the right, you know.

1045
01:14:12,090 --> 01:14:18,550
Speaker 0: Maybe an fps could be really nice if it spreads its way across both screens like that, but so few applications do that.

1046
01:14:19,074 --> 01:14:33,130
Speaker 0: It's like it makes a really good demo But I think it's only a good purchase if you are frequent like your game is a game Like like your your life is focused on a game and that game supports that or something, right?

1047
01:14:33,511 --> 01:14:41,050
Speaker 0: Or you primarily most of the time use an application that supports that giant wide screen, you know one application across both, right?

1048
01:14:41,811 --> 01:14:47,390
Speaker 0: If you're doing two screens with one application left one on the right don't buy the big wide, you know mega screen.

1049
01:14:47,471 --> 01:14:48,827
Speaker 0: It's kind of silly, right?

1050
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:50,193
Speaker 0: Yep, but it is.

1051
01:14:50,294 --> 01:14:54,290
Speaker 0: it is a thing and it exists and it has uses but you make sacrifices in other areas.

1052
01:14:54,935 --> 01:14:58,224
Speaker 0: Uh for that at least right now And that's that.

1053
01:14:58,407 --> 01:15:01,135
Speaker 0: so 2020 screen update.

1054
01:15:01,316 --> 01:15:01,537
Speaker 1: Yep.

1055
01:15:01,657 --> 01:15:04,810
Speaker 1: And if you want to listen to what this was like in 2006, i'll link to that episode.

1056
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:09,670
Speaker 1: You'll hear us talk a lot about crts versus these newfangled early lcd.

1057
01:15:11,051 --> 01:15:13,539
Speaker 0: All right, so we're allowed to do this show again in 2034.

1058
01:15:13,539 --> 01:15:17,009
Speaker 1: All right, hopefully by then it's either just like.

1059
01:15:17,050 --> 01:15:19,579
Speaker 1: well I've got the i-implant and oh I got the.

1060
01:15:19,759 --> 01:15:22,810
Speaker 1: I got the synchronized i-implant, but I got the asynchronous one.

1061
01:15:23,652 --> 01:15:25,514
Speaker 0: I'm waiting for i-implant 2.0.

1062
01:15:25,514 --> 01:15:34,480
Speaker 1: At least This has been geek nights with rim and scott special.
