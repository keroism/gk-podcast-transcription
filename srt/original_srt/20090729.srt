1
00:00:09,500 --> 00:00:11,907
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Wednesday, July 29th.

2
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:12,669
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,689 --> 00:00:16,880
Speaker 1: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight our long-awaited coverage of Otacon.

4
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,593
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:32,517
Speaker 1: Oh Shit, it's geek nights.

6
00:00:32,919 --> 00:00:33,502
Speaker 1: We're back.

7
00:00:33,824 --> 00:00:34,146
Speaker 0: We're kind.

8
00:00:34,186 --> 00:00:34,890
Speaker 0: we were back Monday.

9
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:36,699
Speaker 1: We were back, but it was Monday neckbeard night.

10
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:41,118
Speaker 1: not everyone listens to that and this is the night Everyone was waiting for I guess isn't it?

11
00:00:41,158 --> 00:00:41,419
Speaker 0: you know?

12
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:43,185
Speaker 0: I think there's a problem though, and we.

13
00:00:43,586 --> 00:00:44,650
Speaker 0: it's like this constant battle.

14
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:48,317
Speaker 0: It's like we could have done this episode earlier But we stick to the schedule.

15
00:00:48,478 --> 00:00:51,230
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm sticking to the schedule means we're not gonna be timely.

16
00:00:51,671 --> 00:00:55,102
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I feel like you know if we were timelier.

17
00:00:55,162 --> 00:00:57,870
Speaker 1: It would have been better, but in some ways.

18
00:00:57,930 --> 00:01:06,230
Speaker 1: But at the same time I feel like the slightly faded memory of the convention Kind of crystallizes the things that matter and the stuff that doesn't matter falls to the wayside.

19
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:09,001
Speaker 1: I guess I guess well you know schedule no schedule.

20
00:01:09,443 --> 00:01:14,108
Speaker 1: if we did shows whenever we have an idea We do like ten shows in a row, and then like have a month of nothing.

21
00:01:14,914 --> 00:01:20,121
Speaker 0: Well if we could record the ten shows in a row and just put them out We could but we've never successfully done that.

22
00:01:20,161 --> 00:01:23,294
Speaker 1: the one time ever we were ahead on shows We were like two weeks ahead.

23
00:01:23,856 --> 00:01:26,645
Speaker 1: We just stopped doing shows put them all up, and that was the end of that.

24
00:01:26,666 --> 00:01:27,689
Speaker 0: it sure was.

25
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:40,390
Speaker 1: Plus the news is aren't timely yeah, but you know we had our usual after Otacon a week of awesome But sadly Scott and Emily had to go back to Beacon and work in the city while I went to the week of awesome.

26
00:01:40,611 --> 00:01:44,490
Speaker 1: Alright, but what we did do and people who know me might go.

27
00:01:44,591 --> 00:01:45,437
Speaker 1: Why did rim do this?

28
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:47,290
Speaker 1: we watched all of the new x-men cartoon?

29
00:01:47,792 --> 00:01:51,490
Speaker 1: And now you might be thinking but rim don't you hate the old x-men cartoon?

30
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,055
Speaker 0: I would have been like oh, that's understandable.

31
00:01:53,115 --> 00:01:55,584
Speaker 1: the new x-men cartoon Wolverine and the x-men.

32
00:01:55,986 --> 00:01:56,829
Speaker 1: it's fantastic.

33
00:01:56,849 --> 00:02:00,597
Speaker 0: I Can't say I've not seen it, but I will.

34
00:02:00,717 --> 00:02:02,222
Speaker 0: of course I'm very skeptical.

35
00:02:02,302 --> 00:02:05,130
Speaker 1: pretty much everyone all of us was excited about it.

36
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,609
Speaker 1: We watched the whole thing in almost one go.

37
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:09,673
Speaker 0: Really is it so?

38
00:02:09,693 --> 00:02:12,543
Speaker 1: the show is over or season one is over and season one.

39
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:14,390
Speaker 1: the plot kind of goes from beginning to from.

40
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,096
Speaker 1: Oh shit is Wolverine - oh shit.

41
00:02:16,137 --> 00:02:16,879
Speaker 1: It's Wolverine.

42
00:02:17,261 --> 00:02:17,703
Speaker 0: So is it?

43
00:02:17,823 --> 00:02:18,686
Speaker 0: how long is the season?

44
00:02:18,747 --> 00:02:20,354
Speaker 0: if it's not a Jeff It's not an anime.

45
00:02:20,374 --> 00:02:22,024
Speaker 1: It's like 13 14 episodes.

46
00:02:22,044 --> 00:02:22,567
Speaker 0: Oh, that's it.

47
00:02:22,828 --> 00:02:25,741
Speaker 1: Oh, okay I think I'm pretty sure that what didn't seem like there were that many.

48
00:02:25,821 --> 00:02:27,890
Speaker 0: so it's like a South Park season something like that.

49
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:34,227
Speaker 0: Yeah, all right, but I liked it, okay Ah, so you want to.

50
00:02:36,232 --> 00:02:38,270
Speaker 1: So we did a show, you know.

51
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,957
Speaker 1: And then we disappeared and went to Otacon.

52
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:43,230
Speaker 1: and now we're back and we're going to Connecticut this weekend.

53
00:02:43,731 --> 00:02:53,230
Speaker 1: So Friday Saturday and Sunday, which is Friday, July 31st, Saturday, August 1st and Sunday, August 2nd We will be at Connecticut at the Hartford connecting Center in Hartford, Connecticut.

54
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:55,577
Speaker 1: Connecticut's not really an anime con.

55
00:02:55,617 --> 00:02:56,159
Speaker 1: It's kind of a.

56
00:02:56,541 --> 00:02:57,545
Speaker 0: it's an everything con.

57
00:02:57,605 --> 00:03:01,839
Speaker 0: right on the front of the con book They say everything but the kitchen even though while it's an everything con.

58
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,450
Speaker 1: It's basically an anime con a webcomic.

59
00:03:05,630 --> 00:03:07,095
Speaker 0: It's not even that much an anime con.

60
00:03:07,115 --> 00:03:12,150
Speaker 0: I mean this anime fans and this cosplay but there's really not that much anime content.

61
00:03:12,210 --> 00:03:13,839
Speaker 1: Well, there's a ton of anime screening rooms.

62
00:03:13,859 --> 00:03:15,790
Speaker 1: that has all the accoutrement of an anime con.

63
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:19,130
Speaker 0: Yeah, but mostly it's a webcomic con because it's a ton of webcomic.

64
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:22,124
Speaker 1: It's also a better gaming con than most gaming cons in the.

65
00:03:22,405 --> 00:03:23,490
Speaker 0: it's a pretty great game.

66
00:03:24,593 --> 00:03:30,370
Speaker 0: The board game tabletop roleplay miniatures collectible card is strong as a dealer's room.

67
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:32,830
Speaker 0: I guess the dealer's room has a lot of anime merchandise.

68
00:03:34,251 --> 00:03:36,980
Speaker 0: There's an artist alley which you know, I guess is somewhat anime related.

69
00:03:37,001 --> 00:03:44,266
Speaker 0: There's a video game room, which is kind of good and There's a the sci-fi type guests the kinds you'll see it, you know.

70
00:03:44,306 --> 00:03:56,670
Speaker 0: a sci-fi con Yeah, but also usually a lot of voice actors and a lot of webcomic artists and us being yes We it's actually gonna be real easy to talk about what we're doing at this con because we don't have to list all our panels.

71
00:03:56,831 --> 00:04:04,202
Speaker 1: All right, I think I can sum this up panel 5 from 10 30 Panel 5 because that means I could do.

72
00:04:04,222 --> 00:04:04,725
Speaker 0: Yes.

73
00:04:04,946 --> 00:04:05,468
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

74
00:04:06,272 --> 00:04:07,599
Speaker 1: Panel 5. panel 5.

75
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:08,523
Speaker 1: I'm excited about that.

76
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,910
Speaker 1: when I saw that I was ready.

77
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,434
Speaker 1: I gotta get though.

78
00:04:10,454 --> 00:04:12,490
Speaker 1: I gotta get the table 5 just get it YouTube.

79
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:25,645
Speaker 1: This goes to yeah table 5 but we're going to be running every event in panel 5 either running personally or presenting From 10 30 a.m On Friday until like 5 30 on Sunday for as long as the con goes.

80
00:04:26,347 --> 00:04:28,513
Speaker 0: if there's ever anything You know you're not sure what to do.

81
00:04:28,714 --> 00:04:37,649
Speaker 0: come to panel 5. we will be in there doing something or another front row crew person will be in there doing something or Luke crane slash Jared Sorenson will be in there.

82
00:04:38,691 --> 00:04:40,179
Speaker 1: Uncle Joe's gonna be in there we.

83
00:04:40,661 --> 00:04:45,609
Speaker 1: and the thing is you look at all the other panel rooms Our room is dense compared to the rest of them.

84
00:04:46,372 --> 00:04:48,640
Speaker 0: So kinetic on isn't everything awesome?

85
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,082
Speaker 0: con.

86
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:54,333
Speaker 0: we are running an entire room at this con and also Jared.

87
00:04:54,353 --> 00:05:03,630
Speaker 0: we're bringing, you know, I saw I said already we're bringing Jared Sorenson and Luke crane with us and I guess at their prerogative They will be running many RPG type demo games.

88
00:05:04,412 --> 00:05:12,750
Speaker 0: You know while we are doing panels in panel 5 and also other front row crew peoples will be running many burning wheels and other tabletop role-playing games.

89
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:25,928
Speaker 0: So this kinetic on this is your opportunity if you live near kinetic on you know to come and read days Of rim and Scott three days of rim and Scott and front row crew and burning wheel and everything else.

90
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:26,570
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

91
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:34,570
Speaker 1: So a lot of people email us all the time about the beyond Dungeons & Dragons panel And this is the penultimate time we are doing that panel.

92
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,774
Speaker 1: We will try to film it.

93
00:05:35,834 --> 00:05:37,640
Speaker 1: But if you really want we're doing it.

94
00:05:38,221 --> 00:05:39,626
Speaker 0: thrice more rice.

95
00:05:39,766 --> 00:05:40,388
Speaker 1: Oh crap.

96
00:05:40,468 --> 00:05:44,606
Speaker 1: Well I will count both taxes as one con.

97
00:05:44,626 --> 00:05:44,907
Speaker 1: We're good.

98
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:51,008
Speaker 0: All right As they're doing in a kinetic on Pax West and one more time and then Pax East and then the panel is over.

99
00:05:51,068 --> 00:05:56,289
Speaker 1: and well between Those three I think we'll video it three times and if we don't get a good take from that I give up.

100
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:58,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, we should have videotaped the Otacon one.

101
00:05:58,339 --> 00:05:58,922
Speaker 1: Yeah, we should have.

102
00:05:59,143 --> 00:06:00,469
Speaker 0: did I have anyone videotaped that?

103
00:06:01,231 --> 00:06:01,914
Speaker 0: YouTube it over?

104
00:06:02,235 --> 00:06:02,757
Speaker 0: that'd be nice.

105
00:06:02,918 --> 00:06:03,239
Speaker 0: All right.

106
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:05,630
Speaker 1: So, uh, let's be quick on the anime.

107
00:06:06,552 --> 00:06:07,236
Speaker 0: Thing is right.

108
00:06:07,256 --> 00:06:15,530
Speaker 0: We're usually like at a loss for anime manga comics news Like sometimes we'll do like a geek bite instead But because it was San Diego comic-con and Otacon is a pile of it.

109
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:18,468
Speaker 1: So let me mention the extra week where we didn't even do shows.

110
00:06:18,609 --> 00:06:21,257
Speaker 0: Yep So let me just do two from San Diego.

111
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:23,845
Speaker 0: real quick right one of them requires explanation.

112
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:24,687
Speaker 0: one of them really doesn't.

113
00:06:24,868 --> 00:06:30,430
Speaker 0: number one Pan a Hall H at San Diego comic-con was a fiasco.

114
00:06:30,934 --> 00:06:32,870
Speaker 1: I heard great tell of this.

115
00:06:33,171 --> 00:06:34,315
Speaker 1: I didn't really read any of the news.

116
00:06:34,335 --> 00:06:40,402
Speaker 0: basically Hall H is this big room where they have a video screen and they do panels And mostly it's Hollywood showing shit off.

117
00:06:40,422 --> 00:06:46,530
Speaker 0: so you can go in there and see Trailers and previews of all sorts of things that you know before you're gonna see them on the internet or anywhere else.

118
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:48,300
Speaker 0: Yeah, like avatar.

119
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, Hollywood type stuff, right?

120
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:52,929
Speaker 0: So it's not like, you know, I'm sure it's leaked on the internet now.

121
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:56,449
Speaker 0: But if you wanted to see it first, that was the place line for this room.

122
00:06:57,391 --> 00:07:00,303
Speaker 0: What happened here was you know, San Diego comic-con?

123
00:07:00,323 --> 00:07:07,030
Speaker 0: I mean even though it's a Hollywood con Traditionally the audience for the con is nerds and I guess people in the industry, right?

124
00:07:07,472 --> 00:07:11,270
Speaker 0: You know, you don't really get normal people coming to San Diego comic-con too often.

125
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:33,157
Speaker 0: I mean they go but not in great great quantities, however There was Twilight shit going down And the words got out and apparently a bajillion bajillion Twilight chicks came to San Diego comic-con just because of Twilight and they wanted to see some Twilight shit and some Twilight people in Hall H. So what did they do?

126
00:07:33,177 --> 00:07:40,468
Speaker 0: They basically got to San Diego comic-con lined up for Hall H Got into Hall H and the room never cleared.

127
00:07:40,488 --> 00:07:46,790
Speaker 0: now So those Twilight people stayed in Hall H And they never left until the Twilight thing happened.

128
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:52,930
Speaker 0: And then the Avatar thing, wait, according to the anger video game nerd who was there with Spike TV, right?

129
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,390
Speaker 0: Doing stuff I guess cuz he has a contract with them.

130
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:58,885
Speaker 1: I remember we saw his first video and there's a crazy line behind him.

131
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:06,790
Speaker 0: In his second video He showed his journey to Hall H. He wanted to see the Avatar in Hall H Which he knew was after the Twilight.

132
00:08:07,252 --> 00:08:11,410
Speaker 0: So he figured all the Twilight people would leave and he would get in even though the line was long, right?

133
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,358
Speaker 0: But no, the Twilight people didn't leave.

134
00:08:14,398 --> 00:08:17,610
Speaker 0: they stayed in there and he was shut out like right before the door.

135
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:18,876
Speaker 1: Ah, just like Mike Tool.

136
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:22,050
Speaker 0: And he didn't get to see the Avatar trailer and such.

137
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:24,258
Speaker 0: But he didn't get in to see like some other shit in there.

138
00:08:24,278 --> 00:08:25,262
Speaker 1: I have two points of order.

139
00:08:25,623 --> 00:08:27,289
Speaker 1: Point the first, there's an XKCD.

140
00:08:27,651 --> 00:08:28,828
Speaker 1: That's basically about that.

141
00:08:29,673 --> 00:08:34,429
Speaker 0: One thing I do want to say the anger video game nerd said, well James Rolfe said, is that you're not amused in park.

142
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:38,510
Speaker 0: The line is long, but you know that if you get in the line, you're guaranteed to eventually ride the ride.

143
00:08:39,153 --> 00:08:41,683
Speaker 0: Not so and I think that's that's a problem.

144
00:08:41,724 --> 00:08:53,510
Speaker 1: Well by my second point This is much more important one and considering we're doing a review of Otacon 2009 and our coverage of that It's worth noting that cons like Otacon solved that problem more than a decade ago.

145
00:08:53,590 --> 00:09:01,041
Speaker 1: Whenever there are big events or a room like that They clear the room between every panel And seeing as Hall H everything is a big event.

146
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:03,090
Speaker 0: They should have cleared the room between every single thing.

147
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:06,204
Speaker 1: So SDCC, now you're fucked up.

148
00:09:06,686 --> 00:09:07,489
Speaker 1: Now you're fucked up.

149
00:09:07,911 --> 00:09:08,716
Speaker 0: News number two.

150
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:10,104
Speaker 0: There's a little bit of complicated news.

151
00:09:10,144 --> 00:09:15,330
Speaker 0: People don't know the backstory So I'm going to keep it short and I'm probably gonna get some stuff wrong, but it doesn't matter, right?

152
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:16,052
Speaker 0: Here's the deal.

153
00:09:16,673 --> 00:09:22,590
Speaker 0: Back in the olden days of comic books, there was a comic book called Marvel Man, right?

154
00:09:22,810 --> 00:09:25,230
Speaker 0: And it's a golden age corny ass comic book, whatever.

155
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:29,450
Speaker 0: And the rights to Marvel Man were all disputed and who knows?

156
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:33,702
Speaker 0: Told right because it's Marvel Man, but it wasn't owned by Marvel Comics or was it?

157
00:09:33,783 --> 00:09:34,284
Speaker 0: and whatever?

158
00:09:34,324 --> 00:09:37,520
Speaker 0: right at some point There was a comic book called.

159
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:38,950
Speaker 0: they couldn't call it Marvel Man.

160
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:59,561
Speaker 0: I think they did call it Marvel Man in the UK, but in the US it was called Miracle Man Right by Alan Moore slash Neil Gaiman and apparently it's this great great comic book and I really don't have doubts about that because the names Alan Moore and or Neil Gaiman are on it and I the thing is you know this ran into also some sorts of legal troubles

161
00:09:59,881 --> 00:10:00,102
Speaker 1: and there

162
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:07,010
Speaker 0: was actually a court case like Neil Gaiman versus Todd McFarland and who owns the rights to this thing and blabbity blabbity blah, right?

163
00:10:07,390 --> 00:10:13,859
Speaker 0: And what happened over time was people would like dig through the bins at comic conventions trying to look for Miracle Man issues And they go.

164
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,455
Speaker 0: now if you try to buy it It goes like a bajillion dollars.

165
00:10:16,596 --> 00:10:25,090
Speaker 0: one guy got all the issues and he bound them together in a hardcover book You know with the library binding company and he sold that on eBay for like a bajillion bajillion dollars.

166
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:26,784
Speaker 1: So has someone just scanned this in?

167
00:10:26,906 --> 00:10:27,430
Speaker 1: Is there a torrent?

168
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:34,795
Speaker 0: I'm gonna go, you know, I feel you know totally validated in going to find a torrent and now that I'm you know I'm gonna go look for one after the show.

169
00:10:34,815 --> 00:10:38,225
Speaker 0: because you know, whatever the thing is the news in San Diego.

170
00:10:38,245 --> 00:10:39,730
Speaker 0: Is that Marvel?

171
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:47,790
Speaker 0: Definitely definitely has the rights to Marvel man, they bought it them from the original Marvel Man creator.

172
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:59,030
Speaker 0: so this now brings back all these questions of Is the Miracle Man gonna be re-released in the nice trade hardcover omnibus, you know, whatever it is, right?

173
00:10:59,270 --> 00:10:59,794
Speaker 0: It's it's.

174
00:10:59,834 --> 00:11:01,586
Speaker 0: we're getting close to those time.

175
00:11:01,626 --> 00:11:02,170
Speaker 1: Here's the trouble.

176
00:11:02,210 --> 00:11:09,390
Speaker 1: They might they might have to broach this carefully because how many people who collected that are gonna be angry if it gets re-released.

177
00:11:09,430 --> 00:11:10,460
Speaker 0: Well, you know fuck them.

178
00:11:10,541 --> 00:11:11,288
Speaker 0: It's you know, it's all about.

179
00:11:13,731 --> 00:11:15,034
Speaker 0: That's not Marvel's concern.

180
00:11:15,074 --> 00:11:17,160
Speaker 0: Marvel's because Marvel doesn't make any money off that.

181
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:18,203
Speaker 0: their concern is.

182
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:27,350
Speaker 0: they very much want to be able to Publish a report reprint Miracle Man, which will sell like crazy and trade in hardcover making Marvel a ton of money.

183
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,410
Speaker 0: They couldn't give a shit about the collectors who paid a lot of money for it.

184
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:32,156
Speaker 0: Now the thing is there's.

185
00:11:32,277 --> 00:11:35,208
Speaker 0: you know, there's still issues with Todd McFarlane Guyman.

186
00:11:35,308 --> 00:11:37,859
Speaker 0: more Miracle man isn't the same as Marvel man.

187
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:38,864
Speaker 0: What's gonna happen?

188
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:49,148
Speaker 0: question mark question mark All I can say is I'm hopeful that this supposedly and probably amazing comic book will be read by me at a reasonable price.

189
00:11:55,902 --> 00:11:58,174
Speaker 1: But anyway, we have a lot to cover for Otakon.

190
00:11:58,214 --> 00:12:01,746
Speaker 1: So things of the day The AMV contest was pretty good.

191
00:12:01,786 --> 00:12:04,896
Speaker 1: It wasn't the best AMV contest at Otakon, but I'm seeing.

192
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,080
Speaker 0: we didn't even see the whole contest.

193
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:08,346
Speaker 0: Of course We only see the winners as we do.

194
00:12:08,427 --> 00:12:13,044
Speaker 1: the secret of Otakon is that if you want to see the AMV skip the entire AMV contest.

195
00:12:13,104 --> 00:12:14,291
Speaker 0: it takes too long and it sucks.

196
00:12:14,432 --> 00:12:15,940
Speaker 1: but go to closing ceremonies.

197
00:12:16,061 --> 00:12:20,660
Speaker 1: You will see all the best AMVs and even if the crowd is stupid and they vote for bad ones.

198
00:12:21,141 --> 00:12:27,820
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter because the staff will almost always pick the one like unknown or neglected video and put it in there.

199
00:12:28,364 --> 00:12:33,258
Speaker 1: that's how we saw 2525 and That is how we saw the Krauser video.

200
00:12:33,881 --> 00:12:43,729
Speaker 1: my thing of the day is the last anime music video that won an award at the AMV is no to count 2009 because Surprisingly despite the popularity of Detroit Metal City.

201
00:12:44,131 --> 00:12:46,479
Speaker 1: There was basically zero DMC.

202
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:46,900
Speaker 1: at Otakon.

203
00:12:47,021 --> 00:12:48,328
Speaker 1: I didn't see a single cosplayer.

204
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:48,811
Speaker 0: There was not.

205
00:12:48,992 --> 00:12:53,812
Speaker 0: I mean there might have been I mean everyone I've talked to about Otakon, you know reports seeing different cosplayers.

206
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:55,639
Speaker 0: Some people saw like a hundred Michael Jackson's.

207
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:56,900
Speaker 1: I saw three people's right.

208
00:12:57,241 --> 00:13:01,320
Speaker 0: So I asked the audience at one panel like who here seen a Vashta Stampede and everyone raised their hand.

209
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:01,621
Speaker 0: I'd like.

210
00:13:01,661 --> 00:13:03,630
Speaker 0: I seen zero and then after that I saw one.

211
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,899
Speaker 0: I was like wow, but other people saw like ten.

212
00:13:06,441 --> 00:13:07,203
Speaker 0: so like it's.

213
00:13:07,224 --> 00:13:23,066
Speaker 0: just the con is so big and people move in such patterns that like everyone is gonna have a different perception of The quantities of which characters are cosplayed and the only way to actually figure it out would be to like count or have people Write it down or so, you know some sort of real Scientific study, but

214
00:13:23,086 --> 00:13:25,920
Speaker 1: as far as I can see no one dressed up as crowd.

215
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,200
Speaker 0: It was not nearly enough Krauser definitely.

216
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:34,635
Speaker 1: But one thing I can say is that you know We went to the Vamps concert on Thursday and I didn't realize till after it that what's his name?

217
00:13:34,655 --> 00:13:36,041
Speaker 1: the guitarist who was playing with Odd.

218
00:13:36,061 --> 00:13:39,617
Speaker 1: yeah, he did the guitar part for the opener to DMC.

219
00:13:39,637 --> 00:13:43,108
Speaker 1: apparently Apparently he likes DMC.

220
00:13:43,832 --> 00:13:45,057
Speaker 0: How could you not like DMC?

221
00:13:45,197 --> 00:13:47,086
Speaker 1: Well, of course That's.

222
00:13:47,167 --> 00:13:47,999
Speaker 1: that's beside the point.

223
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:52,903
Speaker 1: There's no Krauser this whole con other than arguably Yeah, it's like.

224
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:54,533
Speaker 0: I was actually before the con.

225
00:13:54,553 --> 00:13:58,560
Speaker 0: I was sort of thinking like, you know What anime do I really want to see, you know busting out at the con?

226
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,851
Speaker 0: I'm like, you know, I'd like to see some DMC.

227
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:09,780
Speaker 0: I'd like to see some Krauser cosplays You know, I'd like to see some you know, that sort of stuff Merchandise in them, you know dealer's room if I can get that really good, you know.

228
00:14:09,860 --> 00:14:12,179
Speaker 0: So tech Krauser that everyone don't see a lot.

229
00:14:12,441 --> 00:14:16,575
Speaker 1: I saw one Jojo, but you really don't see any fist of the North Star cosplay.

230
00:14:16,635 --> 00:14:17,900
Speaker 0: It's not an easy cosplay.

231
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,306
Speaker 0: No one's really got to be big.

232
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:22,620
Speaker 1: Yeah, or you got to be really tiny without with huge huge.

233
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:24,933
Speaker 0: You should go as the North Star peasants.

234
00:14:25,174 --> 00:14:30,353
Speaker 0: Yes anyway But the thing is I didn't see crowds of the whole con and I stopped thinking about it.

235
00:14:30,413 --> 00:14:38,900
Speaker 1: and then as the closing ceremonies That's not as crazy video comes up There's like no Krauser no Krauser no Krauser.

236
00:14:39,161 --> 00:14:41,388
Speaker 1: I've resigned myself to a Krauserless Otakon.

237
00:14:41,849 --> 00:14:43,936
Speaker 1: and then this pretty good music video plays.

238
00:14:43,996 --> 00:14:45,300
Speaker 1: so it's worth watching.

239
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:49,072
Speaker 1: If you don't know what DMC is this will make you realize that it's great.

240
00:14:49,534 --> 00:14:51,280
Speaker 1: All right, I mean he killed his parents.

241
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:59,456
Speaker 0: All right My thing of the day is not actually anime my comic related, but whatever awesome.

242
00:14:59,657 --> 00:15:00,700
Speaker 0: It's this thing called Pixlr.

243
00:15:00,820 --> 00:15:06,320
Speaker 0: It's a web-based Photoshop basically, but it's not quite Photoshop, but it's not quite the gimp.

244
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,124
Speaker 0: It's sort of like.

245
00:15:07,425 --> 00:15:10,420
Speaker 0: it's better than MS Paint and it has features.

246
00:15:10,581 --> 00:15:13,839
Speaker 0: It has nice UI and it's in your browser and it's free.

247
00:15:14,522 --> 00:15:18,320
Speaker 0: What you know and it's really good for like, you know, you can use the Firefox extension.

248
00:15:18,461 --> 00:15:22,220
Speaker 0: Let's say you're on a website and you see an image like you're and you want to edit it real quick.

249
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:24,200
Speaker 0: You know, maybe like paste a face into it or something.

250
00:15:24,702 --> 00:15:31,520
Speaker 0: You can just use the Firefox extension open the image right up edit it real quick and then you know Save it paste it whatever and you're all good.

251
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,022
Speaker 0: So it's.

252
00:15:32,243 --> 00:15:36,340
Speaker 0: it's a handy handy tool for image editings on the Winternets.

253
00:15:36,944 --> 00:15:45,114
Speaker 1: So the moment you've all been waiting for Otakon 2009 we've been going to Otakon every year since 2002 seven years.

254
00:15:45,174 --> 00:15:46,719
Speaker 0: eight years because including the o2.

255
00:15:47,101 --> 00:15:48,971
Speaker 1: I've been doing panels at Otakon since 2002, right?

256
00:15:53,081 --> 00:15:54,000
Speaker 1: Sometimes surreptitiously.

257
00:15:54,106 --> 00:16:00,620
Speaker 1: Yes Only one of my panels at Otakon was me taking over a panel that the person who was supposed to run it didn't show up.

258
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:05,078
Speaker 0: Also for many of the years all the only panel that was done was the club summit.

259
00:16:05,098 --> 00:16:05,219
Speaker 0: now.

260
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:05,580
Speaker 0: It's funny.

261
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:06,500
Speaker 1: You look at the con resume.

262
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:14,054
Speaker 1: It's like anime club summit anime club summit anime club summit and then we busted out with gecky guy And then after that, it was just crazy panels every year.

263
00:16:14,255 --> 00:16:17,176
Speaker 0: Yep, so I think this.

264
00:16:17,257 --> 00:16:24,060
Speaker 0: you know I like to follow a Chronological structure not because I think that makes a good show but because it's easy for me to remember everything that happened at the con.

265
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,032
Speaker 1: Logically it gives us a more narrative style.

266
00:16:27,072 --> 00:16:28,500
Speaker 1: We kind of pull ourselves out of the meta.

267
00:16:28,661 --> 00:16:33,580
Speaker 0: However, I think that it would be a good idea if we take like the big hitting parts of the car.

268
00:16:34,861 --> 00:16:37,656
Speaker 1: Alright Scott, so just before we do the show I'm like so Scott.

269
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:38,420
Speaker 1: Here's my idea.

270
00:16:39,025 --> 00:16:40,780
Speaker 0: I didn't say I came up with the idea.

271
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:42,428
Speaker 0: I said I think it would be a good idea.

272
00:16:42,529 --> 00:16:44,780
Speaker 0: as in I agree with the idea that you came up with my idea.

273
00:16:45,066 --> 00:16:45,271
Speaker 1: That's

274
00:16:45,312 --> 00:16:59,896
Speaker 0: fine You can have the credit but I think it's a good idea if we take the big Hitting topics that we have to talk about Get those out of the way and then do a nice easy chronology because usually if you go straight into the chronology It's like you go you go you go and then you spend way too much time on something.

275
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,910
Speaker 0: you go you go And it's sort of you know, it's not fluid.

276
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:04,980
Speaker 0: the other thing is that big things to the front.

277
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,540
Speaker 0: Then the chronology will be nice and smooth.

278
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:12,419
Speaker 1: Well more importantly the big things we want to talk about are pretty much the only negative things We have to say about Otacon this year.

279
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:16,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean Otacon as always is the second biggest anime con in the US.

280
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:18,365
Speaker 0: It's totally awesome.

281
00:17:18,786 --> 00:17:22,839
Speaker 0: And as always just a few problems that glare and everything else is totally a great time.

282
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,231
Speaker 0: Otherwise, why the hell would I keep paying all this money to go every?

283
00:17:25,372 --> 00:17:26,960
Speaker 1: this is well, but we don't pay for badges.

284
00:17:27,901 --> 00:17:33,200
Speaker 0: You pay a lot of money for the hotel and we driving and the damn you Renaissance pay vacation days.

285
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,970
Speaker 0: I mean I took unpaid days to go down there.

286
00:17:35,372 --> 00:17:36,176
Speaker 1: Ah, that's harsh.

287
00:17:36,437 --> 00:17:37,221
Speaker 0: That's alright I got.

288
00:17:37,522 --> 00:17:54,614
Speaker 1: the other reason is that with the sort of narrative chronological thing and by cutting out the major bad things It's very easy for people like us who've been going to conventions forever to Dwell on the things that stand out to us which are the bad things and it's very easy to get a very negative Impression if we just talk about the things that stand out.

289
00:17:54,694 --> 00:17:55,277
Speaker 0: I mean remember you.

290
00:17:55,297 --> 00:17:56,242
Speaker 0: yeah, it's true You're getting.

291
00:17:56,262 --> 00:17:59,160
Speaker 0: you're getting an impression of the con from people have been to at seven times.

292
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,725
Speaker 0: Somebody went this is their first Otacon was probably blown away and was like, holy shit This is crazy.

293
00:18:04,805 --> 00:18:16,226
Speaker 1: I remember back when we had friends who would still not yet gone to Otacon We'd always have this ritual of like, alright, you haven't been to this con before All right Close your eyes and we take him into the dealers room like into the middle and we'd be like open your eyes and spin in a circle.

294
00:18:16,246 --> 00:18:24,649
Speaker 0: I Mean the dealers room, you know, it might not have the best stuff anymore, but it's still Gigantamous, I mean especially the first time you see it.

295
00:18:24,689 --> 00:18:25,713
Speaker 1: You're not expecting that.

296
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:27,860
Speaker 0: you're not expecting any roommates ginormous.

297
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,607
Speaker 0: I thought I could piss them off more with gigantamous.

298
00:18:29,628 --> 00:18:30,451
Speaker 1: Gigantamous is okay.

299
00:18:30,471 --> 00:18:31,516
Speaker 1: It's more cromulant.

300
00:18:31,556 --> 00:18:32,560
Speaker 1: I think than ginormous.

301
00:18:32,781 --> 00:18:33,623
Speaker 0: I don't think so.

302
00:18:33,964 --> 00:18:39,700
Speaker 1: Anyway, because gigantamous reeks of hit up hippopotamus and hippopotamus is okay in any capacity.

303
00:18:39,721 --> 00:18:40,679
Speaker 1: All right anyway.

304
00:18:40,961 --> 00:18:47,920
Speaker 1: So the other reason the narrative is that I've learned that about a third of the people who listen to our con reviews Haven't gone to the con.

305
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:48,984
Speaker 1: They want to find out what they missed.

306
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:55,071
Speaker 1: but it seems like most of the people who listen to our con reviews and I get This impression of a lot of other people who cover conventions.

307
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:56,740
Speaker 0: They were at the con and they just want to reminisce.

308
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,851
Speaker 1: They just want a replay of the con for nostalgia purposes.

309
00:18:59,911 --> 00:19:00,633
Speaker 1: So there you go.

310
00:19:00,874 --> 00:19:02,540
Speaker 0: All right, so the big hitters?

311
00:19:02,662 --> 00:19:03,331
Speaker 0: What's big hitter?

312
00:19:03,372 --> 00:19:03,919
Speaker 0: number one?

313
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:05,329
Speaker 0: For

314
00:19:05,370 --> 00:19:26,474
Speaker 1: the first time, you know I always praise Otacon that while mailing away badges is difficult and I understand why fan run conventions generally don't do it And I've always forgiven Otacon for that because they handle their pre-reg line to a degree that is staggering and even now despite the problems They process more than 10,000 people on Thursday night for a bunch of volunteers.

315
00:19:26,575 --> 00:19:27,958
Speaker 1: That's pretty amazing.

316
00:19:28,019 --> 00:19:35,939
Speaker 1: like that Props to Otacon for the fact that they are able to handle that many registrations per second continuously, but It's not enough.

317
00:19:36,221 --> 00:19:41,700
Speaker 1: Well every year you have been able to show up at the reg line after a few hours of being open and just kind of

318
00:19:43,022 --> 00:19:55,140
Speaker 0: Feel bad because we told everyone the strategy that worked in all the years past, you know Don't wait in the reg line Thursday or you know Just show up to the reg line on Thursday at like 8 or 9 p.m And by then the line will have cleared out.

319
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,594
Speaker 0: You can just walk in get your badge walk out without any waiting.

320
00:19:57,635 --> 00:20:00,231
Speaker 1: for the first time ever The line was interminable.

321
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,600
Speaker 1: The line was a disaster.

322
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:04,429
Speaker 1: There were just so many people in line and it never abated.

323
00:20:04,830 --> 00:20:07,298
Speaker 1: and Otacon says that they cut the line off.

324
00:20:07,438 --> 00:20:10,500
Speaker 1: at the end They got everyone in who showed up Thursday night to get their badge.

325
00:20:10,581 --> 00:20:16,858
Speaker 1: But I saw numerous reports of people who were turned away from the line near the end as they brought the line inside and shut the doors.

326
00:20:16,879 --> 00:20:19,655
Speaker 1: and A lot of people wanted badges on Thursday who couldn't get them.

327
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,118
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

328
00:20:20,802 --> 00:20:22,488
Speaker 0: So I guess that I didn't see that.

329
00:20:22,508 --> 00:20:25,400
Speaker 0: so I don't know which way it is, but I'll believe either story.

330
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:26,725
Speaker 0: But that doesn't matter.

331
00:20:26,765 --> 00:20:36,560
Speaker 0: the point is if I had had there was no point at which you could walk in get your badge and Walk out which means the line was not processed quickly enough on Thursday regardless of whether people were shut out.

332
00:20:36,841 --> 00:20:38,005
Speaker 1: Getting out of hand.

333
00:20:38,085 --> 00:20:47,980
Speaker 1: there's Otacon is too big and the thing is people who didn't get their badge on Thursday or couldn't show up on Thursday Friday was even worse trying to get your badge and Emily forgot to pre-reg.

334
00:20:48,301 --> 00:20:52,140
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, non pre-reg people and pre-reg people were in mostly the same boat, though.

335
00:20:52,361 --> 00:20:55,400
Speaker 1: So it's not like you were really any better off if you didn't get the yeah.

336
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:59,012
Speaker 0: Well, actually if you think about it, right there was 17,000 pre-reg and they said what 26,000 ish total.

337
00:21:01,301 --> 00:21:02,129
Speaker 0: Yeah, which means 9,000 reg reg.

338
00:21:03,602 --> 00:21:05,491
Speaker 0: You got to think those 9,000 reg reg.

339
00:21:05,551 --> 00:21:07,420
Speaker 0: most of them were there all at once.

340
00:21:07,681 --> 00:21:17,726
Speaker 0: So that was a line of 9,000. if the you assume the pre-reg was split half half Thursday Friday, then that's what like says 8,500 which is still too many.

341
00:21:17,746 --> 00:21:17,906
Speaker 1: Yeah.

342
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:23,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's Each.

343
00:21:23,504 --> 00:21:24,328
Speaker 0: the lines are about equal.

344
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:27,159
Speaker 1: here's what it comes down to one it this cannot stand.

345
00:21:28,224 --> 00:21:29,051
Speaker 1: It's getting out of hand.

346
00:21:29,091 --> 00:21:30,080
Speaker 1: It's only going to get worse.

347
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:35,020
Speaker 1: It's never going to get better and I don't think Otacon can handle the line better than they already do.

348
00:21:35,341 --> 00:21:44,809
Speaker 0: I don't think there's the only one way they could do it is if they also Set up reg boots in another place and had you know Just like twice or three times as many reg boots.

349
00:21:45,230 --> 00:21:46,114
Speaker 1: and that's not gonna have.

350
00:21:46,134 --> 00:21:46,977
Speaker 0: that's not gonna happen.

351
00:21:47,017 --> 00:21:47,820
Speaker 0: cuz where are they gonna put?

352
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:52,840
Speaker 0: Them, you know, they can't put him in the fountain lobby and there really isn't another lobby to lobby.

353
00:21:53,101 --> 00:21:54,870
Speaker 0: No, no Hilton doesn't have a space for that.

354
00:21:54,890 --> 00:22:02,120
Speaker 1: from a selfish perspective I'll just point out that Otacon is the only convention we go to where they make us wait in line for anything.

355
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:06,086
Speaker 1: I mean we do a million panels at all these cons and you know We always talk about the perspectives.

356
00:22:06,126 --> 00:22:14,119
Speaker 1: how if you're a panelist or you're a staffer or you're in the dealer's room at the artist alley You have a very different kind of view of the con and all the structures of the kind of very different for you.

357
00:22:14,863 --> 00:22:29,551
Speaker 1: for us Otacon is the only convention we ever go to where we have to stand in lines and It's getting to the point to where it's actually very difficult for us to manage having to stand in this line Just to have the privilege of doing panels at this con Mm-hmm and the only reason it was terminal.

358
00:22:29,591 --> 00:22:37,080
Speaker 1: it was bearable this year was that We went to the Vamps concert and they gave anyone who went to the Vamps concert who had a ticket Cut to the front of the line pass.

359
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,340
Speaker 1: So we were like among the first five people to get badges for Otacon.

360
00:22:40,541 --> 00:22:41,448
Speaker 0: I know it's Thursday.

361
00:22:41,529 --> 00:22:42,920
Speaker 0: people have been waiting in line for hours.

362
00:22:43,101 --> 00:22:47,080
Speaker 0: We have tickets to this concert and we just walk right up and get our badges immediately.

363
00:22:47,261 --> 00:22:53,300
Speaker 1: And Scott was the person who tweeted out the badge Picture right away because they didn't put up the placards of badges like they usually do.

364
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's actually.

365
00:22:54,303 --> 00:23:05,291
Speaker 0: I think that actually slowed the line down some because people would get up to the registration desk and look And pick out a badge at that point in time rather than if they had the placards up with the badge designs.

366
00:23:05,331 --> 00:23:09,308
Speaker 0: people would decide while they were waiting in line and then just Walk up and be like badge three.

367
00:23:09,489 --> 00:23:11,500
Speaker 0: Well, I guess some indecisive people would stop.

368
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:15,392
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is Otacon is the only major convention I know of that.

369
00:23:15,433 --> 00:23:19,073
Speaker 0: lets you even pick a badge and picking the badge is Nice, it's a cool thing.

370
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:28,018
Speaker 1: It's fun But is it really worth waiting in line hours and hours Even if it takes ten seconds for someone to pick their badge and to deal with all the?

371
00:23:28,038 --> 00:23:30,571
Speaker 1: you know All the logistics of people picking their badges.

372
00:23:31,093 --> 00:23:34,565
Speaker 1: ten seconds times 17,000 pre-reg is.

373
00:23:35,046 --> 00:23:36,070
Speaker 1: that's unacceptable.

374
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:37,193
Speaker 1: now, that's already.

375
00:23:37,233 --> 00:23:39,320
Speaker 1: you're gonna get a significant return by cutting that out.

376
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:44,520
Speaker 0: I think what they should do is either a not have you know badges you can choose from anymore.

377
00:23:44,540 --> 00:23:44,641
Speaker 0: Right.

378
00:23:44,946 --> 00:23:48,026
Speaker 0: B they could have Sort of like rent.

379
00:23:48,067 --> 00:23:51,389
Speaker 0: they can make all this badge art with the Otacon mascots and sort of.

380
00:23:51,409 --> 00:23:52,256
Speaker 0: you get a random one.

381
00:23:52,478 --> 00:23:53,548
Speaker 0: or you know That'd be kind of fun.

382
00:23:54,034 --> 00:24:00,007
Speaker 0: or C right part of the badge could be sort of like this standard badge and Part of the badge would be blank.

383
00:24:00,107 --> 00:24:03,340
Speaker 0: and then you could fill in that blank part of the badge with whatever you want.

384
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,611
Speaker 0: You could get someone to draw something on an artist alley.

385
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:07,300
Speaker 0: You could bring some art to put there.

386
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,948
Speaker 0: You could put stickers there, you know.

387
00:24:09,008 --> 00:24:14,819
Speaker 0: and the rest the other part of the badge would be the unforgeable Uniform part so that you would know you had a real badge.

388
00:24:15,382 --> 00:24:20,800
Speaker 1: The the other solution and to jump very far forward into our coverage the con feedback session.

389
00:24:21,362 --> 00:24:31,038
Speaker 1: This was echoed at the con feedback session and every time someone brought it up and it was brought up numerous times The crowd cheered louder than I've ever heard a crowd cheer at a con feedback session.

390
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:39,773
Speaker 0: Yep I mean I remember in years past when people recommended mailing the badges and the audience would be like The audience would be like, yeah, maybe you know.

391
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:41,579
Speaker 0: and the excuses sort of were like, okay.

392
00:24:41,861 --> 00:24:47,125
Speaker 0: But this year when they said mail the badges everyone was like, yes Yes mail the badges.

393
00:24:47,326 --> 00:24:47,828
Speaker 1: and the thing is.

394
00:24:47,868 --> 00:24:52,677
Speaker 1: it got to the point to where I think the second or third person who went up and was like look mail the badges out.

395
00:24:52,698 --> 00:24:58,438
Speaker 1: and Otacon's response was well No other fan run con does and that person was like Pax.

396
00:24:58,458 --> 00:24:59,944
Speaker 1: does Anime central?

397
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,470
Speaker 0: does San Diego comic-con?

398
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,839
Speaker 0: does New York anime festival does New York comic-con does?

399
00:25:03,899 --> 00:25:07,615
Speaker 0: well Comic-con is nonprofit, but I know it has a large industry.

400
00:25:07,635 --> 00:25:10,120
Speaker 1: but Scott New York comic-con New York anime festival are not fan.

401
00:25:10,321 --> 00:25:12,529
Speaker 0: I'm just saying those are read exhibitions.

402
00:25:12,669 --> 00:25:19,476
Speaker 0: for I know that I'm just saying is that conventions even though they're for-profit Nonprofit whatever right?

403
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:28,620
Speaker 0: The fact is is that Otacon is larger than those conventions and even though it may not have you know Have more resources that it spends because it's not for profit.

404
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:33,000
Speaker 0: It has that size of resource and therefore should be able to do it now.

405
00:25:33,121 --> 00:25:36,400
Speaker 1: We're not gonna dwell on this any further because we'll have to do a separate show on this.

406
00:25:36,741 --> 00:25:37,866
Speaker 1: I emailed anime central.

407
00:25:37,886 --> 00:25:40,940
Speaker 1: I'm trying to get all the different cons and get all their takes on it.

408
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,330
Speaker 0: I think that Pax just contracts it out to someone.

409
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:44,073
Speaker 1: Well, here's my thing.

410
00:25:44,495 --> 00:25:45,680
Speaker 1: I don't care how Otacon does it?

411
00:25:46,220 --> 00:25:50,378
Speaker 1: I feel like Otacon should whatever it takes Otacon should mail out the badges.

412
00:25:50,519 --> 00:25:56,420
Speaker 0: Yep I mean, they have some valid excuses and they have some other excuses, which I think are just excuses.

413
00:25:56,904 --> 00:26:04,603
Speaker 0: But regardless of whether they are valid or not The fact is that it is possible even though it may be difficult and Pretty much.

414
00:26:04,643 --> 00:26:11,435
Speaker 0: they have to conquer that difficulty and do it no matter how difficult it is Even if it was harder than climbing Mount Everest ten times in a row.

415
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:12,340
Speaker 0: They have to do it.

416
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,353
Speaker 0: Anyway, tough shit.

417
00:26:13,455 --> 00:26:13,860
Speaker 0: Just do it.

418
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:19,985
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is even if Otacon doesn't have the manpower which they don't they clearly doubt they can't get that much staff to Show up.

419
00:26:20,066 --> 00:26:21,112
Speaker 0: Yeah in the offseason.

420
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's not gonna happen.

421
00:26:22,721 --> 00:26:26,916
Speaker 1: they should just work it into the budget pay a company to just handle it and that's the end of that.

422
00:26:26,996 --> 00:26:29,404
Speaker 1: but a Corollary to that.

423
00:26:29,704 --> 00:26:33,194
Speaker 1: Here's a quote from an Otacon staffer dot dot dot.

424
00:26:33,254 --> 00:26:34,958
Speaker 1: since badges are so commonly lost.

425
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:39,035
Speaker 1: I Personally replaced over 250 lost badges this weekend.

426
00:26:39,436 --> 00:26:44,080
Speaker 1: now right there Otacon should not replace a lost badge under any circumstances.

427
00:26:44,281 --> 00:26:47,009
Speaker 0: Should there ever be a badge replaced if you lose your badge?

428
00:26:47,410 --> 00:26:48,393
Speaker 0: is the tough shit rule.

429
00:26:48,614 --> 00:26:49,417
Speaker 0: you pay $65 to get a new one.

430
00:26:50,861 --> 00:26:56,742
Speaker 0: Sorry that I mean if I lose my baseball ticket at Chase, you know like a Citi Field Dang good.

431
00:26:56,762 --> 00:26:57,826
Speaker 1: They kick my ass out.

432
00:26:57,846 --> 00:26:59,752
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna be give me a replacement.

433
00:27:00,013 --> 00:27:05,364
Speaker 1: all across the anime convention circuit I see more and more con saying look no replacements You got to pay.

434
00:27:05,384 --> 00:27:09,529
Speaker 0: and if I lose like if you lose your San Diego Comic Con Take you think they give you a replacement.

435
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:13,940
Speaker 0: if you lose your vamps concert ticket You think they're gonna let you in cuz like oh I lost my ticket.

436
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,145
Speaker 0: Can I get a replacement?

437
00:27:15,728 --> 00:27:16,230
Speaker 1: and I just.

438
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:23,129
Speaker 1: I feel like every excuse that Otacon has to not do It really falls flat in light of all the evidence that They have to do it.

439
00:27:23,351 --> 00:27:24,340
Speaker 1: There's no excuse for this.

440
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:25,544
Speaker 1: It's only going to get worse.

441
00:27:26,045 --> 00:27:30,739
Speaker 1: and imagine the resources that would be saved in terms of manpower and frustration.

442
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,875
Speaker 1: if They didn't have to do the get your badge lineup Well, they would still have the.

443
00:27:35,997 --> 00:27:38,408
Speaker 0: you know Buy your badge lineup day of con.

444
00:27:38,749 --> 00:27:40,937
Speaker 0: but think about these resources that would be saved.

445
00:27:40,997 --> 00:27:41,860
Speaker 0: and actually I got it.

446
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:45,220
Speaker 0: This is I guess it can don't start a conspiracy theory about this, right?

447
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,662
Speaker 0: But it is true Right.

448
00:27:46,682 --> 00:27:51,740
Speaker 0: a lot of people buy Thursday night hotel rooms to get in the Thursday pre-reg line.

449
00:27:52,081 --> 00:27:55,311
Speaker 0: That makes the city of Baltimore and surrounding hotels a lot of money.

450
00:27:55,672 --> 00:28:02,577
Speaker 0: if they mailed the badges I would show up Friday morning I wouldn't show up no Thursday night and that would hurt Baltimore and there might I'm not.

451
00:28:03,038 --> 00:28:07,842
Speaker 0: obviously I'm not suggesting there's any conspiracy there or anything along those lines But

452
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:08,587
Speaker 1: if

453
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:30,288
Speaker 0: Otacon actually cares about its members Most then it could save us a lot of money by mailing the badges and thus Saving us the trouble of having to stay in Baltimore an extra day and spending another day's worth of parking costs day's worth of eating out dinner costs and another vacation day at work, you know and Another day of hotel room,

454
00:28:31,091 --> 00:28:32,155
Speaker 1: but we're not gonna dwell on it.

455
00:28:32,175 --> 00:28:33,480
Speaker 1: We're gonna do other shows in the future.

456
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:38,340
Speaker 1: We'll talk about this a lot but Otacon you have like this is no longer acceptable.

457
00:28:38,481 --> 00:28:41,151
Speaker 1: It is just out of control and it is definitely do.

458
00:28:41,191 --> 00:28:43,600
Speaker 0: would you not go if they didn't mail the badges next year?

459
00:28:44,124 --> 00:28:44,811
Speaker 1: Well, here's the thing.

460
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:51,520
Speaker 1: I If I have I don't know if I would be willing to wait in that line regardless of what we were doing.

461
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:56,384
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think if I could skip the line because of my not so special status I would still go.

462
00:28:56,465 --> 00:29:08,357
Speaker 0: but if I had to wait in that line and they didn't mail the badges I might not go to Otacon next year unless there's like some crazy crazy crazy guests that I just can't miss like You know a Yumi or something like that.

463
00:29:09,584 --> 00:29:20,540
Speaker 1: but anyway, we don't want to dwell on that because Otacon was super awesome this year, but Major Problem the second and this is such a multifaceted issue that we have tied into the first issue a little bit.

464
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:27,639
Speaker 1: Also, it's more tied into like four or five issues that followed from it because it'll all come down to the root cause.

465
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:31,991
Speaker 1: but Daryl Surratt the infamous Daryl Surratt is awesome.

466
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:38,571
Speaker 1: He's anime world order guy one of the one of the three people and He did a panel with us and he tried to.

467
00:29:38,591 --> 00:29:40,920
Speaker 1: you know, he gave us all these videos for know your creators.

468
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,559
Speaker 1: He's like, I want to show all these.

469
00:29:44,122 --> 00:29:45,568
Speaker 1: Issue which director was it?

470
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:47,497
Speaker 0: crazy guy the ninja scroll guy.

471
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:50,864
Speaker 0: Yeah We're rank amateurs And such.

472
00:29:51,167 --> 00:30:01,272
Speaker 1: yes Alright, and he sent us all these videos right before the con to show and they were good videos But almost all of them included a female breast.

473
00:30:01,372 --> 00:30:03,700
Speaker 0: and well, it wasn't just the container breast.

474
00:30:04,081 --> 00:30:07,454
Speaker 0: They showed a nipple or two and I was first like Daryl.

475
00:30:07,474 --> 00:30:08,197
Speaker 1: We can't show these.

476
00:30:08,458 --> 00:30:09,000
Speaker 1: It's Otacon.

477
00:30:09,562 --> 00:30:11,449
Speaker 0: It's Otacon and always at Otacon is 10 a.m.

478
00:30:11,489 --> 00:30:13,175
Speaker 0: On Friday in a non 18 plus panel.

479
00:30:13,476 --> 00:30:14,439
Speaker 0: We can't show a nipple.

480
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:18,100
Speaker 0: So not that I personally have an objection to it, but we'll get in trouble.

481
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:24,220
Speaker 0: Trouble for showing you know, right man at an 18 plus panel, which is perfectly legitimate.

482
00:30:24,461 --> 00:30:32,400
Speaker 1: Yep, and I still point out to this day Otacon showed Ebola syndrome that nothing I could do could ever top that.

483
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:44,618
Speaker 0: I do think that's kind of crazy is that Otacon will show Ebola syndrome in an 18 plus video room But they won't allow Content that's even close to that level of nastiness right in one of its panel rooms also 18 plus.

484
00:30:45,724 --> 00:30:47,174
Speaker 1: Well, the thing is they did allow the panel.

485
00:30:47,235 --> 00:30:52,960
Speaker 0: We didn't get in trouble No, but they did call us in and yell at us, but I think they were concerned.

486
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:56,071
Speaker 0: I think they were not concerned about Ebola syndrome thing is.

487
00:30:56,131 --> 00:30:59,082
Speaker 1: I think they yelled at Gerald because we kind of threw him under The bus.

488
00:30:59,383 --> 00:31:02,032
Speaker 1: we were like, yeah that other guy brought that video.

489
00:31:02,132 --> 00:31:03,055
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

490
00:31:03,096 --> 00:31:06,260
Speaker 0: Everyone got away with it But anyway, it was all good.

491
00:31:07,061 --> 00:31:10,673
Speaker 1: Story had a panel titled animes craziest deaths.

492
00:31:11,035 --> 00:31:14,828
Speaker 0: I wanted to see this panel real bad But I'm sure I can just get Daryl to send me all the videos.

493
00:31:14,868 --> 00:31:19,266
Speaker 1: the line for this panel caused an enormous Problem at Otacon.

494
00:31:19,326 --> 00:31:21,014
Speaker 1: it blocked the entire 300 level for a while.

495
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:36,946
Speaker 0: First of all, they put in panel three and this shows that they did not put quite enough thought into which panels go into which Rooms, they obviously put some thought into it But not enough because I think regardless of you know, it might be difficult to guess on other panels How many people want to show up?

496
00:31:37,006 --> 00:31:44,480
Speaker 0: But if something is called animes craziest deaths I mean that is obviously needs to go in the biggest available panel room, right?

497
00:31:44,660 --> 00:31:50,119
Speaker 0: There's just no question that is gonna get a huge line and they put it in a big room But not the biggest room.

498
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:57,743
Speaker 1: The line was like I'm not exact Scott kind of cut in the line and I went all the way to the end of the Line to see what was going on In the panel.

499
00:31:57,783 --> 00:31:58,666
Speaker 0: six in the Hilton.

500
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:03,862
Speaker 1: there were and I'm not exaggerating thousands of people in line to see this Thousand.

501
00:32:03,882 --> 00:32:09,820
Speaker 1: the room only held a few hundred and the like peep and everyone every person that line was super excited about it.

502
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:19,660
Speaker 0: This was gonna be like the biggest thing and somehow when they closed the door and didn't let anyone else in my tools It was Mike tool me and a whole bunch of FRC type people's all right at the front.

503
00:32:19,861 --> 00:32:21,930
Speaker 1: Mike tool was the very front person in the line.

504
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,979
Speaker 1: I came over and I was like you didn't get in.

505
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,428
Speaker 1: He's like, yeah, what are the odds?

506
00:32:25,609 --> 00:32:27,520
Speaker 0: All right, so it's like we're all staying there.

507
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,630
Speaker 0: It's like wow, so it happens to be us.

508
00:32:29,671 --> 00:32:33,427
Speaker 0: the friends of the panelists can't get into the panel So we all agree to bail.

509
00:32:33,467 --> 00:32:34,953
Speaker 1: We're like, alright, let's just go get lunch.

510
00:32:35,114 --> 00:32:35,495
Speaker 0: Of course.

511
00:32:35,535 --> 00:32:36,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the obvious strategy.

512
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:40,598
Speaker 0: You can't waste your time at an Otacon where you have such a. you know, your time is limited there.

513
00:32:40,618 --> 00:32:42,112
Speaker 0: spend it It's precious.

514
00:32:42,112 --> 00:32:49,099
Speaker 1: 15 minutes later I'm standing out there and I get an SMS to you hanging with the princess tutu cosplayer.

515
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,846
Speaker 1: Yes We'll talk about them in the chronology.

516
00:32:50,906 --> 00:32:55,084
Speaker 1: Yes to the effect of the panel was shut down WTF.

517
00:32:55,144 --> 00:32:56,980
Speaker 0: and I was like, yeah, I know it was shut down and filled up.

518
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:57,323
Speaker 0: They're like.

519
00:32:57,383 --> 00:33:01,954
Speaker 0: no he got shut down shut down Like they kicked everyone out of the room and the panel was over.

520
00:33:01,974 --> 00:33:07,536
Speaker 0: and I'm like, wow Now the only times I've heard of that are the 4chan panel and another panel.

521
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:08,260
Speaker 0: that also happened.

522
00:33:08,561 --> 00:33:10,688
Speaker 1: So here's the high-level overview.

523
00:33:11,230 --> 00:33:14,240
Speaker 1: Otacon decided the panel was not appropriate for non 18 plus content.

524
00:33:14,581 --> 00:33:19,897
Speaker 1: So they shut it down immediately and they gave no recourse to have it rerun or schedule later or anything.

525
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:20,820
Speaker 1: It was done.

526
00:33:20,901 --> 00:33:24,064
Speaker 1: they gave no option of Warning.

527
00:33:24,546 --> 00:33:28,560
Speaker 1: no no option of you know shows things that don't violate the rule.

528
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:31,656
Speaker 1: they just shut it down and there was no appeal whatsoever.

529
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:43,055
Speaker 1: and I'm going to say right now before we get into the details of it that all things considered I can't blame Otacon for shutting the panel down and while they could have handled that aspect of it better.

530
00:33:43,075 --> 00:33:46,547
Speaker 1: I Agree with Otacon shutting down the panel.

531
00:33:46,969 --> 00:33:49,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean obviously they had to do something right?

532
00:33:50,181 --> 00:33:57,920
Speaker 0: They could have done something better, but this was obviously a Satisfactory that you know, it's not something you can say you shouldn't have done that.

533
00:33:59,163 --> 00:34:04,860
Speaker 1: You know, there were so many empty slots in the panel schedule because Otacon did not fill their panel.

534
00:34:05,101 --> 00:34:09,659
Speaker 1: In fact when we went to check in for our panels the panel guy was like, yeah, can you guys do some more panels?

535
00:34:10,721 --> 00:34:14,377
Speaker 1: No, yeah, we refused to but they they had a lot of open play.

536
00:34:14,397 --> 00:34:19,739
Speaker 1: they could have Trivially put this in like the panel room between our two panels.

537
00:34:20,021 --> 00:34:23,518
Speaker 1: That panel room was gigantic and could have held at least a quarter of the crowd that wanted to see it.

538
00:34:23,742 --> 00:34:31,460
Speaker 1: Yep But anyway, the art while Otacon was right at that point a lot of question was to where did the blame lie?

539
00:34:31,620 --> 00:34:34,268
Speaker 1: Did Daryl pull a fast one by not making this 18 plus?

540
00:34:34,649 --> 00:34:48,779
Speaker 1: and the answer is unequivocally this is 100% Otacon's fault but not for the reasons you might think mm-hmm because you see Otacon Did not read their panel Applications as far as I can tell at all.

541
00:34:49,261 --> 00:34:56,364
Speaker 0: They basically there is no evidence that they have read them and there is a mountain of evidence that they did not read them or at Least did not read them very thoroughly.

542
00:34:56,404 --> 00:34:59,092
Speaker 1: what panel descriptions for our panels were?

543
00:34:59,152 --> 00:35:02,080
Speaker 1: like the taught like me telling Otacon what the panels were?

544
00:35:02,281 --> 00:35:06,556
Speaker 0: Yes, they put our panel proposals in the pocket guide as opposed to our panel.

545
00:35:06,616 --> 00:35:08,627
Speaker 1: It was like yeah this panel We ran it at PAX.

546
00:35:08,687 --> 00:35:09,815
Speaker 1: It runs 55 minutes.

547
00:35:09,875 --> 00:35:10,580
Speaker 1: It needs a projector.

548
00:35:10,721 --> 00:35:15,280
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty slick and cool and you should let us run an Otacon blah blah blah And that's what it said in the con book.

549
00:35:15,621 --> 00:35:22,903
Speaker 0: Also, they seem to have removed like all the commas basically the pocket guide that has the descriptions of all the events was a complete Unedited disaster.

550
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:34,240
Speaker 0: and while I understand that a person bailed out of Otacon at the last second and they needed to rush to get it Done that is a very very important thing and you cannot afford even if you have to rush to get it done.

551
00:35:34,623 --> 00:35:40,914
Speaker 0: There is still sort of like a minimum level You know of job that has to be done on it before you can send it off to the printer.

552
00:35:41,316 --> 00:35:49,069
Speaker 0: and they just didn't Do it, you know, I mean, it's it's somewhat, you know, they could have even like called me up and said hey Do you want to edit this pocket guide?

553
00:35:49,089 --> 00:35:52,750
Speaker 0: and I put it, you know, if they needed it the next day I would have stayed up overnight and made sure it was.

554
00:35:53,232 --> 00:35:54,680
Speaker 0: I could have made it a lot better than it was.

555
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,064
Speaker 0: Let's just say that much now.

556
00:35:56,185 --> 00:36:04,300
Speaker 1: It wasn't just there just as another example of this sloppiness, which is leading up to why this happened Gekoku Inoue who is the voice of Belle dandy.

557
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:09,080
Speaker 1: She's a super popular voice actress and she's pretty famous and is really cool that she came to Otacon.

558
00:36:10,241 --> 00:36:15,480
Speaker 1: She was a voice actress for Oh Yankee Clinic, which is a hentai a horrifying hentai.

559
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:18,440
Speaker 0: I'm not sure how horrifying it is, but it's a hentai and I wouldn't watch.

560
00:36:18,641 --> 00:36:22,534
Speaker 1: I have a one of the manga of it over there that we really do.

561
00:36:22,774 --> 00:36:24,159
Speaker 1: it was given to me by Wyatt.

562
00:36:24,561 --> 00:36:26,168
Speaker 1: It was signed by Steve Bennett.

563
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:27,093
Speaker 0: Oh that.

564
00:36:27,173 --> 00:36:28,097
Speaker 0: Oh, Genki Clinic.

565
00:36:28,218 --> 00:36:29,629
Speaker 0: Yes I didn't really.

566
00:36:29,649 --> 00:36:33,433
Speaker 0: I thought that that was just a American thing that Steve Bennett did for him.

567
00:36:33,473 --> 00:36:34,860
Speaker 0: I didn't realize it was an actual anime.

568
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,052
Speaker 1: Oh, Genki Clinic is a horrifying hentai.

569
00:36:37,193 --> 00:36:37,535
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

570
00:36:37,555 --> 00:36:38,440
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is horrified.

571
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:42,320
Speaker 1: It is true that Gekoku Inoue was a voice actress in it and there's a lot.

572
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:50,015
Speaker 1: there's a whole bunch of debate about this, but she they never released a Version of it in America legitimately with her doing the acting.

573
00:36:50,397 --> 00:37:00,105
Speaker 0: they also Like, you know her agency or whatever doesn't let that information get out Like they don't list her as having been in it and that's why you it's hard to get Oh Genki Clinic in Japan Apparently and

574
00:37:00,427 --> 00:37:05,019
Speaker 1: presence like presence of it in America Conventions that talk do anything with her.

575
00:37:05,582 --> 00:37:10,239
Speaker 1: People are very respectful of this and they don't print that in the con book and hardly anyone knows it.

576
00:37:10,722 --> 00:37:12,380
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, even ask a question about it.

577
00:37:12,601 --> 00:37:15,899
Speaker 1: I like I'd heard rumors, but I didn't really know the story until this happened.

578
00:37:16,282 --> 00:37:17,659
Speaker 1: Oh to kind of just printed this in the book.

579
00:37:18,101 --> 00:37:22,359
Speaker 1: So someone at one of her panels was like blah blah blah Oh Genki Clinic and he wasn't.

580
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:24,999
Speaker 0: you know He didn't realize there was a controversy like we didn't realize it.

581
00:37:25,341 --> 00:37:32,788
Speaker 0: he just read it in the con book and asked about it and she got mad upset and the people who knew that this is a Really

582
00:37:32,808 --> 00:37:34,560
Speaker 1: the whole crowd was like, oh my god

583
00:37:37,141 --> 00:37:42,040
Speaker 0: You know people in the crowd knew this is a sensitive issue But this guy just read it in the con book.

584
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,265
Speaker 0: So that guy isn't at fault.

585
00:37:43,365 --> 00:37:45,956
Speaker 0: Otakon was at fault for letting that be in the convo.

586
00:37:46,016 --> 00:37:46,176
Speaker 0: Now.

587
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:47,040
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

588
00:37:47,683 --> 00:37:57,427
Speaker 1: I would never ever fault someone for telling the truth and I'm not an advocate of censorship and I wouldn't necessarily Like the fact that Otakon did it.

589
00:37:57,527 --> 00:38:03,958
Speaker 1: if they did it knowingly I would have taken a position that yes It's an asshole thing to do but you know what they have the right to do.

590
00:38:03,978 --> 00:38:15,271
Speaker 1: clearly I think it's obvious that Otakon Regrets that being a con Otakon screwed up because Jim would never have let that happen if he had read this and clearly a staffer At some point along the way fucked up.

591
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:24,771
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean if it was our convention We would have intentionally printed it in there like or or we would have paid made very especially, you know We would not have printed it there.

592
00:38:24,851 --> 00:38:25,719
Speaker 1: We would not have fucked it up.

593
00:38:26,041 --> 00:38:29,800
Speaker 0: Yes, you know it's one of the two but if it was intentional it was okay.

594
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:32,631
Speaker 0: It was accidental it, you know, then it's like.

595
00:38:32,671 --> 00:38:34,940
Speaker 0: it's not okay and it was accidental by Otakon.

596
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,549
Speaker 0: It was a failure in editing but these two things together.

597
00:38:37,669 --> 00:38:40,338
Speaker 1: now back to Daryl's anime craziest death panel.

598
00:38:40,759 --> 00:38:50,698
Speaker 1: now There is a whole controversy about the fact that I'll link to in our things that are in the post The clip that got the panel shut down and here's the pro.

599
00:38:50,718 --> 00:38:59,695
Speaker 1: the real issue I would take is that if there had not been two kind of distant nipples in this video Gigantic not anywhere near realistic.

600
00:38:59,816 --> 00:39:04,240
Speaker 1: Yeah nipples By Otakon's own admission at the con feedback session.

601
00:39:04,641 --> 00:39:10,440
Speaker 1: This panel would have been fine because America has this crazy double standard where violence is great, but a nipple is verboten.

602
00:39:10,561 --> 00:39:13,326
Speaker 0: Yes, but like I you know We talked about someone at the con.

603
00:39:13,366 --> 00:39:18,106
Speaker 1: feedback was like so you're saying that if it'd been just as violent But you didn't show a nipple.

604
00:39:18,127 --> 00:39:18,751
Speaker 1: It would have been fine.

605
00:39:18,771 --> 00:39:23,270
Speaker 1: and the staffer was like, yes Absolutely, and I you know watch this video.

606
00:39:23,712 --> 00:39:28,689
Speaker 0: It is a horrifying explosion of The thing is I want to bring up something.

607
00:39:28,749 --> 00:39:30,940
Speaker 0: Carol Bart's who's the newer CEO of Yahoo?

608
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:38,235
Speaker 0: Someone questioned her at a press conference and said, you know, Yahoo Why are you being all you know doing business in China and censorship and all that right?

609
00:39:38,496 --> 00:39:43,101
Speaker 0: and we always think you know Google Yahoo, Microsoft Censorship in China, they're bad Right.

610
00:39:43,121 --> 00:39:53,620
Speaker 0: The thing is she said something that I sort of have a hard time arguing against even though I still feel there's something wrong With this argument and that is she said Yahoo wasn't created to fix China.

611
00:39:54,142 --> 00:39:58,440
Speaker 1: Right, and that's the same thing for anyone who says that Otakon she just said blah and gone for it.

612
00:39:59,083 --> 00:40:02,180
Speaker 1: It's not Otakon's responsibility to fix American Puritan.

613
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:06,294
Speaker 0: Yeah, Otakon's, you know, Otakon's mission statement is not fix.

614
00:40:06,314 --> 00:40:08,200
Speaker 0: the United States is pure in ways.

615
00:40:08,281 --> 00:40:15,978
Speaker 0: You know Otakon's mission statement is you know Exist and spread anime and you know, love otaku generation, etc, etc.

616
00:40:17,583 --> 00:40:20,300
Speaker 0: And it has you know, nothing in there about fixing America.

617
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:32,563
Speaker 0: So, you know since that's not part of what Otakon sits out to do in all other aspects They're just going to act within the laws and regulations of the Convention Center the city of Baltimore the state of Maryland the United States The UN etc.

618
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:36,698
Speaker 1: So did Daryl Surratt just not check this as 18 plus when he should have?

619
00:40:37,019 --> 00:40:38,937
Speaker 1: well Maybe he did not check it.

620
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:47,160
Speaker 1: But you realize Otakon has this form you fill out to submit a panel and in the form There's a section that says is there anything important?

621
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:53,860
Speaker 1: We need to know about your panel and I put a whole bunch of stuff in there on all our panels which apparently Otakon didn't read because or at least they didn't.

622
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,242
Speaker 0: They didn't.

623
00:40:55,483 --> 00:40:55,825
Speaker 0: it didn't.

624
00:40:55,845 --> 00:40:56,106
Speaker 0: they didn't.

625
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,577
Speaker 0: we didn't have any evidence whatsoever that they read it.

626
00:40:58,939 --> 00:41:18,800
Speaker 1: because Daryl in his submission I'm gonna paraphrase because I have what Daryl actually wrote here But he said in that section the content in this panel contains strong graphic violence and the possibility of nudity But no graphic sex or hentai beyond what would be seen in an upper tier like r-rated movie.

627
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:32,638
Speaker 0: That is the reason why I did not check it as 18 plus Yep, and apparently, you know Otakon did not publish at least not anywhere that I saw, you know I didn't look for it granted, but I didn't see anywhere a policy about what makes 18 plus.

628
00:41:33,220 --> 00:41:38,980
Speaker 1: No, and you know what in the panel, they're really, you know as a panelist and it never really made it any.

629
00:41:39,321 --> 00:41:45,691
Speaker 1: They never said what you when you have to take it when you don't and to it is Otakon's responsibility to determine that not the panel.

630
00:41:45,772 --> 00:41:56,020
Speaker 0: Yep, and also You know Daryl Ran this exact panel at many other conventions in non 18 plus time slots with no issue whatsoever.

631
00:41:56,361 --> 00:42:02,140
Speaker 0: So so Otakon has a different standard from other conventions, which is fine, but you can have a different standard.

632
00:42:02,180 --> 00:42:03,104
Speaker 0: You just have to make it known.

633
00:42:03,164 --> 00:42:06,680
Speaker 1: but it's not obvious and to no one read this at all.

634
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:17,056
Speaker 0: No obviously No one read it at least any whoever read it did not act on it or think about it or anything and they accepted the Panel just fine and they let him run it without the 18 plus like in the afternoon.

635
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:22,776
Speaker 1: Yep Otakon is just so at fault here and I don't know what to do about it.

636
00:42:22,796 --> 00:42:24,043
Speaker 1: Let us take over panels I don't know.

637
00:42:24,305 --> 00:42:27,683
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would read all the panel descriptions That's at least.

638
00:42:27,944 --> 00:42:28,566
Speaker 0: at the very least.

639
00:42:28,606 --> 00:42:40,215
Speaker 0: I would read all the panel descriptions and the pocket guide wouldn't be messed up and Big panels obviously crowded panels would be in bigger rooms And other than that, I would probably run everything else the same as it is now.

640
00:42:40,376 --> 00:42:40,979
Speaker 0: and there you go.

641
00:42:41,804 --> 00:42:47,480
Speaker 1: So that was pretty much the biggest Disaster of Otakon because that was as far as I can see based on the count of people in line.

642
00:42:48,063 --> 00:42:50,817
Speaker 1: That would have far and away been the most popular panel of the entire con.

643
00:42:51,078 --> 00:42:51,900
Speaker 0: possibly All right.

644
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:55,393
Speaker 0: So are there any other big things that Otakon we have to cover before we do the chronology?

645
00:42:55,754 --> 00:42:57,340
Speaker 1: Oh big big things.

646
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,480
Speaker 1: There was the bleach panel thing, but we can talk about that later.

647
00:42:59,621 --> 00:43:00,263
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's it.

648
00:43:00,283 --> 00:43:03,876
Speaker 0: We'll do that chronologically because that was something we heard about afterwards and was not.

649
00:43:03,957 --> 00:43:05,784
Speaker 0: so, you know It wasn't that big a deal.

650
00:43:06,648 --> 00:43:07,271
Speaker 1: It was pretty cool.

651
00:43:07,291 --> 00:43:15,440
Speaker 1: There's one last thing I do want to mention about Gophers and gopher ring because this came up at the feedback session and it came up again on the forums.

652
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:19,060
Speaker 0: I just want to mention we brought it up in a show how to fix anime cons.

653
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:27,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, but one of the staffers at Otakon when someone complained about how you know being a panel it or being a gopher It really like.

654
00:43:27,464 --> 00:43:28,006
Speaker 1: isn't that fun?

655
00:43:28,046 --> 00:43:28,608
Speaker 1: at Otakon?

656
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:35,942
Speaker 1: and as you know panelists I can say that by and large the gophers I ran into couldn't act like they could not answer any questions I had

657
00:43:36,022 --> 00:43:41,886
Speaker 0: like every gopher that I ran into Otakon and I ran into quite a few and tried to you know Get help from quite a few of them.

658
00:43:42,288 --> 00:43:43,673
Speaker 0: They all see they were all nice.

659
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,480
Speaker 0: They were all trying to be helpful.

660
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,692
Speaker 0: They were all well-meaning and hard-working right?

661
00:43:47,873 --> 00:43:49,040
Speaker 0: They were all great gophers.

662
00:43:49,180 --> 00:43:51,047
Speaker 0: The thing was is that they just.

663
00:43:51,067 --> 00:43:53,054
Speaker 0: they were obviously improperly trained.

664
00:43:53,094 --> 00:43:54,920
Speaker 0: They didn't know their way around the convention center.

665
00:43:55,241 --> 00:43:56,366
Speaker 0: They didn't know the schedule.

666
00:43:56,587 --> 00:43:59,880
Speaker 0: They didn't know even where the information desk was which had moved this year.

667
00:43:59,921 --> 00:44:00,650
Speaker 0: That was the first thing.

668
00:44:00,670 --> 00:44:05,040
Speaker 0: when I walked in the con The information desk was replaced by the lost and found and the information desk had moved.

669
00:44:05,421 --> 00:44:06,727
Speaker 0: So I asked a nearby gopher.

670
00:44:07,029 --> 00:44:08,616
Speaker 0: Where did the information desk move to?

671
00:44:08,636 --> 00:44:14,200
Speaker 1: Oh Now the worst part is and not to really disparage Otakon, but the staff were largely the same way.

672
00:44:14,301 --> 00:44:17,699
Speaker 1: I I rarely encountered a staffer who could answer any question I had.

673
00:44:18,640 --> 00:44:22,683
Speaker 0: basically, it's it's not that the staff aren't hard-working or Such.

674
00:44:22,804 --> 00:44:29,560
Speaker 0: is that they have this sort of attitude that I think is harmful to the convention and They just they just need to fix it.

675
00:44:29,580 --> 00:44:37,260
Speaker 0: There's no that that's pretty much the bottom line that these staff and gophers of Otakon have an attitude and a culture that is harmful.

676
00:44:37,361 --> 00:44:46,540
Speaker 0: They are not particular often You know disrespectful to guests, you know, not guests of the members of the con badge holding.

677
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:49,493
Speaker 0: You know attendees as well as you know gophers.

678
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:59,309
Speaker 1: not saying this is not across the board It's just a general attitude, you know About the relevant quote and this started out shitstorm in the forum quote Gophering is not supposed to be fun.

679
00:44:59,329 --> 00:45:00,597
Speaker 1: You're put where you're put if you don't like it.

680
00:45:00,657 --> 00:45:01,100
Speaker 1: Don't do it.

681
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:01,865
Speaker 1: It's as simple as that.

682
00:45:02,488 --> 00:45:04,440
Speaker 1: and all I want to say we don't want to dwell on this year.

683
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:06,954
Speaker 0: This is a whole separate show that we have the show on it already.

684
00:45:07,015 --> 00:45:12,620
Speaker 1: Yes anime cons Yes, but we we will highlight it again at some point because we're going to PAX and everything.

685
00:45:12,720 --> 00:45:19,338
Speaker 1: But I bring it up because in the forum that same staffer basically said enforcers.

686
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:20,220
Speaker 1: What are you kidding?

687
00:45:21,121 --> 00:45:25,919
Speaker 1: Yeah, like they they they clearly did not understand what needs to change in staffing.

688
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,860
Speaker 0: Yes I think that you know that I mean, here's it here.

689
00:45:28,940 --> 00:45:31,040
Speaker 0: Let me I can sum it up by doing two impressions.

690
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:43,519
Speaker 1: I got emails from some Otakon staffers who were first-year staffers and a few of them posted in the forum to Basically saying like you know what we try But we just like no one told us what to do and a lot of times I watered around with nothing to do.

691
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:48,276
Speaker 0: Yep here I'm gonna do two impressions here and I think these impressions will sum up everything we have to say.

692
00:45:48,337 --> 00:45:51,269
Speaker 0: and let us get a move On and not extend this episode any further, right?

693
00:45:51,731 --> 00:45:58,452
Speaker 0: This is my impression of an Otakon staffer Managing a line to an event in which no cameras are allowed.

694
00:45:58,552 --> 00:45:59,154
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

695
00:45:59,174 --> 00:46:00,177
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

696
00:46:00,197 --> 00:46:15,700
Speaker 0: I know you're gonna do Basically yelling at the people in line as if they are children right yelling at them like hey you punk kids This is the rules.

697
00:46:16,561 --> 00:46:18,070
Speaker 0: That's an Otakon staffer right.

698
00:46:18,090 --> 00:46:19,820
Speaker 0: there actually is an Otakon staffer.

699
00:46:19,921 --> 00:46:29,808
Speaker 0: I don't even know their name But they do exist and I've run into them at my first Otakon in o2 and I ran into a similar person If not the same person at the Otakon o9.

700
00:46:29,908 --> 00:46:33,440
Speaker 0: now here is a Pax enforcer in the same situation.

701
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:35,185
Speaker 0: Dude, no cameras.

702
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:35,627
Speaker 0: What's up?

703
00:46:35,909 --> 00:46:36,411
Speaker 0: Oh, come on.

704
00:46:36,733 --> 00:46:36,974
Speaker 0: Listen.

705
00:46:36,994 --> 00:46:37,416
Speaker 0: All right here.

706
00:46:37,677 --> 00:46:40,956
Speaker 0: Give me your camera I'll put in lost and found and then after you get out of here, you'll find it.

707
00:46:41,037 --> 00:46:45,863
Speaker 0: All right, cool Go man, right improvisation Treat it treating.

708
00:46:45,944 --> 00:46:46,686
Speaker 1: Here's the attendees.

709
00:46:46,706 --> 00:46:48,611
Speaker 0: with respect improv being helpful.

710
00:46:48,812 --> 00:46:51,720
Speaker 1: improvisation come knowing solutions got things.

711
00:46:51,860 --> 00:47:01,339
Speaker 1: improvisation comes with one thing and that is authority the fact that any Enforcer from the lowest to the highest rank has equal authority to improvise on the spot and make things work.

712
00:47:01,781 --> 00:47:04,510
Speaker 0: Yep, and they're also, you know train.

713
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,340
Speaker 0: They're also trained enough that they are trusted with that authority.

714
00:47:07,842 --> 00:47:21,932
Speaker 1: If you don't believe that our anecdotal evidence here's a specific example Darryl's and you know panel craziest anime deaths shut down kind of ham-fisted Lee Otakon staffers could have like fixed it by moving the panel somewhere.

715
00:47:21,992 --> 00:47:22,313
Speaker 1: do it like.

716
00:47:22,553 --> 00:47:28,859
Speaker 1: they could have done something to make everyone happy and Solve the situation if they had just had the authority to think on their feet and improvise.

717
00:47:29,521 --> 00:47:44,419
Speaker 0: when we ran beyond D&D at PAX and a mob of Panel like hundreds of people yet Unexpectedly for the old for the first time we went over to where the gaming tables were and they were all full which had not Been true for the entire con.

718
00:47:44,540 --> 00:47:46,306
Speaker 1: So the packs enforcers all these

719
00:47:46,347 --> 00:47:47,531
Speaker 0: people with no tables to

720
00:47:47,551 --> 00:47:58,186
Speaker 1: say all these packs enforcers saw our trouble and they came over like guys You need some help and we're like, yeah, we got this mob We got to run like another panel on the fly and they were like, uh, let me check and they get on the radios And they're like panel room.

721
00:47:58,206 --> 00:47:59,755
Speaker 1: Whatever is empty go there.

722
00:47:59,996 --> 00:48:02,931
Speaker 1: We'll put up a sign We'll point everyone who's trying to find you guys over there.

723
00:48:03,253 --> 00:48:11,000
Speaker 1: and then they sent us all these other Enforcers to like set up microphones for us and to run this panel room for us on the spot at like 11 o'clock at night.

724
00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:18,060
Speaker 0: Yep They just completely improvised and just they grabbed tables from somewhere and they set up this panel room and made it happen on the spot.

725
00:48:18,140 --> 00:48:19,064
Speaker 0: They saw there was a problem.

726
00:48:19,084 --> 00:48:21,654
Speaker 0: They saw there was a crowd that was doing something.

727
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:23,020
Speaker 0: That wasn't you know, quite right?

728
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:24,126
Speaker 0: They had nowhere to go.

729
00:48:24,147 --> 00:48:24,872
Speaker 0: It was lost.

730
00:48:25,215 --> 00:48:27,386
Speaker 0: They saw it They descended upon it and they fixed it.

731
00:48:27,748 --> 00:48:32,709
Speaker 1: and before you say but PAX is a for-profit con Pax enforcers are not paid.

732
00:48:32,789 --> 00:48:35,160
Speaker 1: They're just as volunteer as Otakon gophers.

733
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:46,439
Speaker 0: Yes the only difference is in their attitude the way they are managed the amount of training they have the Enthusiasm they have the respect they have for each other the respect they have for the attendees and the respect the attendees have for them.

734
00:48:47,262 --> 00:48:52,680
Speaker 1: And I think that I used to think that anime con culture and anime con demographics could not support something like that.

735
00:48:53,247 --> 00:48:54,020
Speaker 1: I've changed my opinion.

736
00:48:54,121 --> 00:49:03,160
Speaker 1: I think it's because I know Otakon staffers who are exactly like that and I think you could get enough of those staffers If you just change the culture around anime conventions.

737
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:08,120
Speaker 1: But the culture of anime con staffing is a whole separate issue and we want to get to all the awesome stuff from Otakon.

738
00:49:08,140 --> 00:49:11,893
Speaker 0: Yep, and I think the one the Otakon's major difficulty is its inertia.

739
00:49:12,054 --> 00:49:13,840
Speaker 0: It's been doing it for how many years it's gonna.

740
00:49:14,302 --> 00:49:15,528
Speaker 0: It's very hard to change it.

741
00:49:15,951 --> 00:49:17,885
Speaker 0: Whereas Pax started off on the right foot Yep.

742
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:24,985
Speaker 1: Also Pax kind of started in a vacuum and kind of didn't have all the accoutrement and the baggage of old gaming cons and old Anime con.

743
00:49:25,005 --> 00:49:26,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, they just made it up as they went along.

744
00:49:26,540 --> 00:49:28,920
Speaker 0: They didn't you know, they barely looked at other cons, you know.

745
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,550
Speaker 0: So they didn't do anything according to the status quo.

746
00:49:31,590 --> 00:49:34,020
Speaker 0: They did things according to the way that they thought it should be done.

747
00:49:34,462 --> 00:49:37,297
Speaker 0: So anyway, yep, let's do the chronology of Otakon.

748
00:49:37,378 --> 00:49:39,887
Speaker 1: All right now This is this is very concert.

749
00:49:40,088 --> 00:49:42,937
Speaker 1: very pointedly this capsule is gonna be long, but that's fine.

750
00:49:42,957 --> 00:49:43,680
Speaker 1: You guys like this stuff.

751
00:49:43,860 --> 00:49:50,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, but very pointedly we did not get press passes this year and we tried to wander around the con straight up as attendees.

752
00:49:51,142 --> 00:49:53,209
Speaker 0: Yep, I mean panelists don't get a special badge.

753
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:56,200
Speaker 0: So we had the same badge as everyone else only we were running some panels.

754
00:49:56,280 --> 00:50:01,400
Speaker 1: Yep, so consider this a almost a blog post as opposed to like objective press coverage.

755
00:50:01,480 --> 00:50:04,456
Speaker 1: We're gonna talk about like I was trying to get dinner and stupid Baltimore and everything.

756
00:50:04,798 --> 00:50:04,918
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

757
00:50:05,381 --> 00:50:13,490
Speaker 1: So we showed up Thursday like we always do at noon and for the first time in Seven years the Renaissance Hotel just fucked us.

758
00:50:14,192 --> 00:50:22,328
Speaker 1: every year like we have this ritual we show up at noon We get a room like right next to the elevator like at noon at the Renaissance Early check-in.

759
00:50:22,832 --> 00:50:30,776
Speaker 1: we like hang out We go skip the line and get our badges because we're panelists and then we go and like swim in the pool and have a super Awesome party all night long.

760
00:50:30,817 --> 00:50:33,491
Speaker 1: Thursday The Renaissance Hotel just screwed us.

761
00:50:33,511 --> 00:50:34,960
Speaker 1: They didn't give us a room to like three the rooms.

762
00:50:35,061 --> 00:50:37,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, they gave our friend a room immediately Yep.

763
00:50:37,654 --> 00:50:43,218
Speaker 1: and And we registered the room like we got the room like months before they did and the rooms felt like chlorine.

764
00:50:43,258 --> 00:50:47,189
Speaker 0: and this is right next to the pool and the staff becomes far away from the elevator as possible.

765
00:50:47,209 --> 00:51:02,524
Speaker 1: and Beyond that the only reason we stayed in the Renaissance every year was because Right near the Renaissance over in the power plant is where all the good restaurants are but the one good restaurant out of business Yep, and basically like everything was fail and I've given up.

766
00:51:02,564 --> 00:51:04,450
Speaker 1: they've crossed me for the last time.

767
00:51:04,531 --> 00:51:05,018
Speaker 0: Yep, next year.

768
00:51:05,038 --> 00:51:05,790
Speaker 0: We're gonna stay in the Hilton.

769
00:51:05,831 --> 00:51:15,045
Speaker 1: Yeah They also gave us a one king-size bed despite us having reserved the room for two beds and four people Like the week after Otacon last year.

770
00:51:15,065 --> 00:51:15,145
Speaker 1: Yeah.

771
00:51:15,467 --> 00:51:18,441
Speaker 0: Yeah Fail on the hotel.

772
00:51:18,842 --> 00:51:20,470
Speaker 0: also the parking is still way too expensive.

773
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:28,466
Speaker 0: Yeah Next year the Hilton which is attached to the con I think will actually Save us a lot of time because how many times do we have to like walk back get the banner and stuff?

774
00:51:28,526 --> 00:51:28,747
Speaker 1: course?

775
00:51:28,787 --> 00:51:30,997
Speaker 0: a lot Of those trips can be a very much.

776
00:51:31,178 --> 00:51:32,905
Speaker 0: we can save a lot of time if we stay in that hell.

777
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:36,390
Speaker 1: a lot of people had Trouble, however with the Hilton I'll get into that at the con feed.

778
00:51:36,430 --> 00:51:37,515
Speaker 0: I don't think we'll have trouble.

779
00:51:37,595 --> 00:51:38,017
Speaker 1: we won't.

780
00:51:38,118 --> 00:51:39,805
Speaker 1: but four or five years ago.

781
00:51:39,905 --> 00:51:40,950
Speaker 1: We would have that's true.

782
00:51:41,151 --> 00:51:47,879
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, so the vamps concert on Thursday, but of course we skipped the pre-reg line Which is insanely long because we had vamps concert tickets.

783
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:49,726
Speaker 0: Yeah, that worked very well that line.

784
00:51:49,766 --> 00:51:50,790
Speaker 0: Skip we got our badges.

785
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:52,541
Speaker 0: We went over to the vamps concert.

786
00:51:52,561 --> 00:51:53,889
Speaker 0: We took a cab with a cool cabbie.

787
00:51:54,030 --> 00:51:55,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, he was all nice.

788
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:57,430
Speaker 1: and now we took the cab because we're really sure where the place was.

789
00:51:57,530 --> 00:51:59,278
Speaker 1: But the place is like a couple blocks from.

790
00:51:59,419 --> 00:52:01,909
Speaker 0: yeah, it looked much farther away on the map than it actually was.

791
00:52:02,371 --> 00:52:03,918
Speaker 1: Anyway, that's just Seattle syndrome.

792
00:52:03,958 --> 00:52:04,681
Speaker 0: We got in line.

793
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:07,135
Speaker 0: We met all kinds of cool people at the concert people We knew.

794
00:52:07,378 --> 00:52:20,890
Speaker 1: particularly behind us There was this really cute anime girl with her mom and her mom was like totally lazy Matsumoto like super awesome, like awesome, like I talked to her the whole time in line about like she is like old-school awesome.

795
00:52:21,011 --> 00:52:23,605
Speaker 0: We also walk past a weird like Satan Church.

796
00:52:24,067 --> 00:52:34,224
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I got some pictures of that like some other weird stuff on the way past like that scary-looking like rusty Blood-covered looking like can top and then later we saw the hobo can.

797
00:52:34,244 --> 00:52:35,168
Speaker 1: it was associated with.

798
00:52:35,188 --> 00:52:39,910
Speaker 0: yeah Anyway, so we event, you know, regardless there was weird stuff in the line for the concert.

799
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:41,056
Speaker 0: The line was a bit long.

800
00:52:41,418 --> 00:52:43,549
Speaker 0: concert started a little bit late, but that was all right.

801
00:52:43,831 --> 00:52:47,950
Speaker 0: Yep, we eventually got in the room and we were greeted with an awesome concert.

802
00:52:48,612 --> 00:52:56,590
Speaker 1: Any a lot of people we know we're like, I'm not interested in that concert or I don't want Your loss, you're all stupid.

803
00:52:57,836 --> 00:53:05,264
Speaker 1: Anyone who thinks they don't want to go to a concert because you know I don't like that style of music unless it's phantom ass live music is always badass and

804
00:53:05,264 --> 00:53:14,440
Speaker 0: 99% of live music is badass Regardless of genre or whether you know it already or don't know it already or anything Even like a band that usually like people would be rate.

805
00:53:14,781 --> 00:53:17,310
Speaker 0: It can be pretty awesome live, but here's the thing.

806
00:53:17,571 --> 00:53:21,430
Speaker 1: Here's the awesome part, you know hide the frontman for this band Vamps one.

807
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:25,249
Speaker 1: They're a lot more like hardcore and hard rocky a little bit of metal than they used to be.

808
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:26,253
Speaker 1: Oh, well, he used to be.

809
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:31,273
Speaker 1: it was a great concert and they did this interesting cover of Lucy in the sky with diamonds near The end.

810
00:53:31,293 --> 00:53:31,938
Speaker 1: that was pretty cool.

811
00:53:31,978 --> 00:53:32,684
Speaker 0: That's pretty good.

812
00:53:33,228 --> 00:53:36,670
Speaker 1: But During the concert, you know, he stops and he addresses the crowd.

813
00:53:36,730 --> 00:53:43,050
Speaker 0: He's like hello Baltimore And the thing is at what we never go to these j-rock concerts in the US, right?

814
00:53:43,391 --> 00:53:45,198
Speaker 0: They typically don't speak a lot of English.

815
00:53:45,238 --> 00:53:46,805
Speaker 0: the highs English is you know, it's alright.

816
00:53:46,845 --> 00:53:47,829
Speaker 0: He's definitely learned about it.

817
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:49,150
Speaker 1: Yes is very specific.

818
00:53:50,193 --> 00:53:52,150
Speaker 1: He's always like hello Baltimore.

819
00:53:52,831 --> 00:53:57,990
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you know, he'll say he won't say a lot right, but he'll say like a few things with a lot of power.

820
00:53:58,071 --> 00:54:00,688
Speaker 0: He'll be like, yeah, we're going to take care of you.

821
00:54:01,151 --> 00:54:02,818
Speaker 1: He reminds me a lot of that metal band.

822
00:54:02,838 --> 00:54:03,862
Speaker 1: We saw in in Poughkeepsie.

823
00:54:03,903 --> 00:54:05,610
Speaker 1: Do you like Christians?

824
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:23,557
Speaker 0: Yeah So anyway, you know if anyone knows back at the Larkin CL concert, you know five years ago whatever right he did similar shtick and one of the shticks was Did you eat crap?

825
00:54:23,777 --> 00:54:24,801
Speaker 1: and that was the famous.

826
00:54:24,821 --> 00:54:25,705
Speaker 1: the whole audience?

827
00:54:25,725 --> 00:54:26,548
Speaker 1: He's like blah blah.

828
00:54:26,568 --> 00:54:29,999
Speaker 1: the audience goes And he's like do you eat crap?

829
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:37,749
Speaker 1: and there's this slight pause as the audience goes And then everyone cheers anyway because clearly he doesn't mean crap.

830
00:54:38,091 --> 00:54:44,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then he's talking about eating crab because as Emily tells us the thing to do in Japan This is all about the local food, right?

831
00:54:45,110 --> 00:54:47,038
Speaker 0: It's like Emily went to see him in.

832
00:54:47,439 --> 00:54:54,183
Speaker 1: doing this concert in New York is like I eat pizza Slice as big as my head, which that's New York pizza.

833
00:54:54,304 --> 00:55:05,648
Speaker 0: Yeah, so if you ever go to Japan I think that it would probably be a very good idea to learn the local special food of wherever you're going Because then the people will like you and possibly be less xenophobic towards you.

834
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,538
Speaker 1: actually It's France is pretty much the same way.

835
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:17,524
Speaker 1: if you're in some little French town and you just order Maybe I just take that as a general travel tip for the world learn the local foods except in America and always eat the local Specialty wherever you are because then you might end up with scrapple.

836
00:55:17,866 --> 00:55:24,150
Speaker 0: You might end up with Yeah, you might have a grits also anyway, but that you know that he realized on the stage shoe.

837
00:55:24,190 --> 00:55:26,684
Speaker 1: He's like what I say wrong what I say wrong.

838
00:55:27,006 --> 00:55:27,267
Speaker 1: Oh, well.

839
00:55:27,529 --> 00:55:34,010
Speaker 0: Yes You know for years and years and years that has been an inside joke with us sort of an outside joke.

840
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:35,917
Speaker 0: We'd always be like did you eat crab?

841
00:55:36,258 --> 00:55:41,055
Speaker 1: and as far as I can tell it has been a joke among just pretty much a Lot of people who went to that concert.

842
00:55:41,075 --> 00:55:41,597
Speaker 1: like people.

843
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:43,705
Speaker 1: it resonated people remembered that.

844
00:55:43,725 --> 00:55:44,830
Speaker 0: something about that.

845
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:46,155
Speaker 0: Yeah, did you eat crab?

846
00:55:46,195 --> 00:55:47,158
Speaker 0: just stuck?

847
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:50,150
Speaker 0: and I didn't think that he would remember.

848
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:52,160
Speaker 0: I'm like how would he know that people remember that?

849
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:52,864
Speaker 0: how would he know?

850
00:55:52,884 --> 00:55:54,150
Speaker 0: and then oh, you know?

851
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,950
Speaker 0: I'm like the whole concert every time.

852
00:55:56,010 --> 00:55:56,291
Speaker 0: I'm like.

853
00:55:56,592 --> 00:56:00,185
Speaker 0: you know I was actually really looking forward to the parts where he said stuff instead of singing.

854
00:56:00,205 --> 00:56:00,526
Speaker 0: right.

855
00:56:00,847 --> 00:56:03,979
Speaker 0: I was like is He gonna say something about the crab what he's gonna say?

856
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:13,369
Speaker 1: he comes out, and he's like hello Baltimore Did you eat crab, but he says it and then he gets like he kind of cocks his head like he like.

857
00:56:13,389 --> 00:56:13,690
Speaker 0: he's like.

858
00:56:13,750 --> 00:56:14,654
Speaker 0: He knows like.

859
00:56:14,715 --> 00:56:22,944
Speaker 1: he knew he's so new and everyone was just like yeah Because every everyone in that crowd knew like.

860
00:56:23,486 --> 00:56:28,502
Speaker 0: everybody knew Everybody knew the score, and then he said a few other things you know.

861
00:56:28,542 --> 00:56:30,850
Speaker 0: and then he said do you eat crab again?

862
00:56:31,690 --> 00:56:32,675
Speaker 0: Cuz he knew it was a man.

863
00:56:33,158 --> 00:56:34,425
Speaker 0: it was a fantastic.

864
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:39,770
Speaker 0: That's like if you went to like a Rick Astley concert, and he came out.

865
00:56:39,830 --> 00:56:41,619
Speaker 0: He's like be like Rick roll, but you know Chris.

866
00:56:41,659 --> 00:56:43,810
Speaker 0: He does do that, but you know I'm just saying it's the same.

867
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:49,275
Speaker 0: It's like if he knew before you thought he knew Anyway, but the concert was awesome.

868
00:56:49,336 --> 00:56:53,890
Speaker 1: awesome concert shoutouts to everyone we met cuz we hung out with like a ton of cool.

869
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:55,702
Speaker 0: We hung out with so many people at this con.

870
00:56:55,762 --> 00:56:56,870
Speaker 0: I don't remember all of you.

871
00:56:56,991 --> 00:57:02,562
Speaker 1: I remember some I know your name Cool girl and your mom who were hanging out behind us in line.

872
00:57:02,823 --> 00:57:05,090
Speaker 1: cool people in front of us punk kids behind us.

873
00:57:06,111 --> 00:57:13,604
Speaker 1: That is also where I saw the gothical leader with the tiny hat and I decided that my goal in life is to see someone Wearing four of those tiny stupid.

874
00:57:13,624 --> 00:57:14,410
Speaker 0: we decided three hats.

875
00:57:14,550 --> 00:57:20,414
Speaker 1: I think you got to go all the way to four three like in a crown like in a circle and then one on top Of one of the other ones a

876
00:57:20,434 --> 00:57:21,297
Speaker 0: little pyramid

877
00:57:21,477 --> 00:57:22,481
Speaker 1: something like maybe ten

878
00:57:22,541 --> 00:57:24,087
Speaker 0: in sort of like a bowling pair like a

879
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:25,030
Speaker 1: stack of pancakes

880
00:57:25,711 --> 00:57:26,434
Speaker 0: Or a stack of cups.

881
00:57:26,915 --> 00:57:37,403
Speaker 1: anyway anyway, and like we met Erin who we met at PAX as well Yeah, she came all the way from Western Canada Bus from Western Canada and stayed in the hostel by Otakon.

882
00:57:37,424 --> 00:57:38,266
Speaker 0: that's dedication.

883
00:57:38,387 --> 00:57:39,190
Speaker 1: She's pretty cool, too.

884
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:46,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, totally awesome, but we also went to the seven a 7-eleven after the concert and they had individual servings of simply lemonade.

885
00:57:46,852 --> 00:57:48,780
Speaker 1: And then you know in the 7-eleven.

886
00:57:48,880 --> 00:57:53,725
Speaker 1: all these people are like oh my god, we're in Scott Yeah, woo in the 7-eleven everyone knew us.

887
00:57:54,007 --> 00:58:01,862
Speaker 0: so yeah We should have hung out the 7-eleven the whole time to meet the listeners anyway, so Saturday morning at Otakon Friday Friday morning.

888
00:58:02,143 --> 00:58:06,335
Speaker 0: I meant Friday, but I said Saturday so Trouble Friday morning.

889
00:58:06,355 --> 00:58:11,355
Speaker 1: now Otakon has never gotten those goddamn doors open at the right time, but this year It's 8 o'clock.

890
00:58:11,395 --> 00:58:12,624
Speaker 0: the cons supposed to be open doors.

891
00:58:12,665 --> 00:58:16,710
Speaker 1: a shot this year They got them open relatively quicker than other years, but we had a problem.

892
00:58:17,213 --> 00:58:21,254
Speaker 1: We had a panel pretty early on Friday at 10 and the second panel.

893
00:58:21,455 --> 00:58:22,899
Speaker 1: there's a line like one.

894
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,750
Speaker 1: none of the doors are open and there's this line like this crazy crazy line to get into the con.

895
00:58:29,252 --> 00:58:34,449
Speaker 1: So we go to the front the other privacy that street entrance because no one will let us in any other door.

896
00:58:34,549 --> 00:58:35,815
Speaker 0: and well I mean, it's understandable.

897
00:58:35,835 --> 00:58:38,066
Speaker 0: They can't open the middle street doors.

898
00:58:38,127 --> 00:58:38,790
Speaker 0: What's that Street?

899
00:58:39,172 --> 00:58:43,430
Speaker 0: I forget the middle street doors because you know the red line is passing by there.

900
00:58:43,490 --> 00:58:45,519
Speaker 0: So they can't open those until the red line is passed.

901
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:46,201
Speaker 0: understandable.

902
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:47,025
Speaker 0: Okay.

903
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:52,449
Speaker 0: They never opened the sky wall They never opened the sky walk, but actually they did open the sky walk this year.

904
00:58:52,872 --> 00:58:56,050
Speaker 0: But the thing is they don't open enough doors on the regular entrance.

905
00:58:56,110 --> 00:58:59,543
Speaker 0: They open one door and the people trickle in also too little too late.

906
00:58:59,623 --> 00:59:09,279
Speaker 1: and the the crux of this was Panels started at 9 and the doors open like at 9 15 and there was no one in the Convention Center Except the people were getting their pre-reg badges that morning.

907
00:59:09,721 --> 00:59:11,730
Speaker 1: So basically all the nine o'clock panels were empty.

908
00:59:12,072 --> 00:59:14,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was the thing if you got your pre-reg badge, right?

909
00:59:14,910 --> 00:59:16,530
Speaker 0: Because the reg doors opened on time.

910
00:59:16,590 --> 00:59:21,810
Speaker 0: So you got your pre registered or registered and got your badge immediately like your first in line Friday.

911
00:59:22,134 --> 00:59:23,350
Speaker 0: You just stayed in the con.

912
00:59:23,912 --> 00:59:29,610
Speaker 0: So those people got in before people who bought their badges got their badges Thursday and waited for these other freaking doors to open.

913
00:59:29,892 --> 00:59:32,150
Speaker 0: They need to open all of those doors.

914
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:36,241
Speaker 0: Not obviously not the ones that you can't open but all of the openable doors.

915
00:59:36,602 --> 00:59:39,690
Speaker 0: open all of them immediately at the opening minute.

916
00:59:40,613 --> 00:59:44,790
Speaker 1: Or don't schedule panels when no one can possibly be in the center.

917
00:59:44,931 --> 00:59:46,056
Speaker 0: Also a good idea.

918
00:59:46,136 --> 00:59:48,427
Speaker 1: more importantly we had a panel we couldn't get in.

919
00:59:48,527 --> 00:59:49,170
Speaker 1: we find some staff.

920
00:59:49,190 --> 00:59:53,330
Speaker 1: We're like look we got a panel we got to get in and finally the guys like alright fine.

921
00:59:53,531 --> 00:59:56,624
Speaker 1: And he let us in and we go to panel ops and we set everything up.

922
00:59:56,664 --> 01:00:03,704
Speaker 1: We barely make it to our panel, but Other panelists weren't so lucky and one panelist very specifically like.

923
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:05,630
Speaker 1: they went in and they're like look we got again.

924
01:00:05,770 --> 01:00:12,010
Speaker 1: We got a panel at nine and the staffer said to them You should have gotten in line earlier like everyone else.

925
01:00:14,290 --> 01:00:16,436
Speaker 1: Whoa, whoa is right now later.

926
01:00:16,457 --> 01:00:16,998
Speaker 1: Oh two counts.

927
01:00:17,038 --> 01:00:21,130
Speaker 1: official response was and I quote whoever said that was misinformed.

928
01:00:21,462 --> 01:00:22,850
Speaker 0: Yes I think that's you know.

929
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:28,533
Speaker 1: I think again the problem of too many staffers are misinformed and too many staffers take this Adversarial.

930
01:00:28,553 --> 01:00:37,650
Speaker 1: they're misinformed or malinformed or uninformed and they take this kind of adversarial Like this bad guy position when they could have worked something out.

931
01:00:38,091 --> 01:00:46,270
Speaker 1: but this also is the problem that Otacon is trying to prevent the other problem of People sign up to do panels just to get the perks and then just don't show up for their panels.

932
01:00:46,551 --> 01:00:51,891
Speaker 0: I think Otacon sort of has this assumption that anyone who's gophering or doing a panel or whatever is just out for a free Bad.

933
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:55,770
Speaker 0: here's the thing and only the staff and the button is the people who are really working hard.

934
01:00:55,950 --> 01:00:57,598
Speaker 0: Otacon tried to go to the con.

935
01:00:57,658 --> 01:01:05,144
Speaker 1: Otacon tried to fix this problem by making it to where you basically get Jack for shit if you're a panelist and they still had tons and tons of panels.

936
01:01:05,184 --> 01:01:07,130
Speaker 1: just not show up just not do their panels.

937
01:01:07,451 --> 01:01:10,902
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the thing is someone's doing a panel and showing up.

938
01:01:11,203 --> 01:01:13,230
Speaker 0: That's someone who cares about the convention.

939
01:01:13,250 --> 01:01:14,536
Speaker 0: They're just like the staff.

940
01:01:14,596 --> 01:01:17,470
Speaker 0: We're not trying to scam a free badge, right?

941
01:01:17,751 --> 01:01:21,130
Speaker 0: I mean, I'd probably pay the cost isn't the problem, right?

942
01:01:21,492 --> 01:01:22,437
Speaker 0: I mean, it's it's.

943
01:01:22,598 --> 01:01:24,630
Speaker 0: I want to help the con just as much as the staff.

944
01:01:24,711 --> 01:01:26,390
Speaker 0: But here's I'm helping in a different way.

945
01:01:26,551 --> 01:01:40,028
Speaker 1: I don't want to dwell on that any further other than to say that a bunch of Otacon staff have come up to us several of them independently of one another and a couple as a group as a group and it basically says that they're going to sponsor us To like take control of one panel room or one video room and run stuff in it.

946
01:01:40,129 --> 01:01:42,365
Speaker 0: Yeah We're working on something for next year.

947
01:01:42,405 --> 01:01:43,050
Speaker 0: That could be awesome.

948
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:46,591
Speaker 0: We'll possibly become staff or who knows what but yeah We're gonna.

949
01:01:46,812 --> 01:01:53,332
Speaker 1: we're gonna do our best to do some fixings within our power because our policy as always is if we're told to put Up or shut up.

950
01:01:53,352 --> 01:01:57,610
Speaker 0: We're always willing to put up and then if you deny our put up then we can trash you.

951
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:58,918
Speaker 1: That's why we drop Katsu Khan.

952
01:01:58,938 --> 01:01:59,723
Speaker 1: We weren't willing to put up.

953
01:01:59,964 --> 01:02:05,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, so we shut up okay, so So we caught our way in and we did.

954
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,190
Speaker 1: you know the panel staffer to his credit?

955
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:12,640
Speaker 1: I had the packs attitude because we were like Can we leave this banner in here overnight?

956
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:17,780
Speaker 1: And he's like the no you can't the policies No, and I was like we were like, so is it?

957
01:02:17,861 --> 01:02:18,924
Speaker 1: no we can't or is it?

958
01:02:19,266 --> 01:02:20,370
Speaker 1: you won't stop us.

959
01:02:20,490 --> 01:02:22,120
Speaker 1: But if it disappears, it's our fault.

960
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,930
Speaker 1: and he was like, I'm not gonna stop you.

961
01:02:24,091 --> 01:02:25,298
Speaker 1: So we hit it in the corner and it was fine.

962
01:02:25,399 --> 01:02:25,640
Speaker 0: Yep.

963
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:27,330
Speaker 0: See that's a packs attitude that guy had.

964
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:29,910
Speaker 0: That was the panel staff guy that the guy was in panel ops.

965
01:02:30,010 --> 01:02:33,166
Speaker 0: Yes, very much like, you know, we are not responsible for lost or misplaced items.

966
01:02:33,206 --> 01:02:35,159
Speaker 0: and we're like, thank you We'll leave this right here.

967
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:35,643
Speaker 0: Good day.

968
01:02:35,825 --> 01:02:36,248
Speaker 1: Good day, sir.

969
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:39,965
Speaker 0: See that is the correct attitude to have and he was also the one improvising.

970
01:02:40,005 --> 01:02:41,070
Speaker 1: Can you guys do more panels?

971
01:02:41,872 --> 01:02:43,258
Speaker 0: Yeah, we didn't know we did.

972
01:02:43,499 --> 01:02:48,830
Speaker 0: so we went to our first panel know your creators Which I have to admit was not the greatest panel.

973
01:02:48,911 --> 01:02:51,870
Speaker 0: The major problem with it was that we planned to retool it.

974
01:02:51,970 --> 01:02:56,145
Speaker 0: We failed to retool it and be we did not do enough preparation.

975
01:02:56,185 --> 01:02:57,590
Speaker 0: We planned to meet with Daryl Surratt.

976
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:01,270
Speaker 0: It was also on the panel on Thursday, and we failed to meet him on Thursday.

977
01:03:01,270 --> 01:03:05,958
Speaker 1: The fact that almost every video he sent me had boobs in it Yes, so it was very difficult.

978
01:03:06,018 --> 01:03:08,308
Speaker 0: And also we had a technology fail which is rims fault.

979
01:03:08,690 --> 01:03:09,453
Speaker 1: now I have.

980
01:03:09,534 --> 01:03:17,044
Speaker 1: well the thing is while I had some problems with that with the videos Other an industry panel had a similar problem in the same room.

981
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:17,305
Speaker 0: Yes.

982
01:03:17,386 --> 01:03:18,269
Speaker 0: I was at the Bana entertainment.

983
01:03:18,590 --> 01:03:23,770
Speaker 0: I was at a portion of the Bana entertainment panel in that same room and they had similar difficulties.

984
01:03:23,891 --> 01:03:25,418
Speaker 0: So it was not entirely our fault.

985
01:03:25,459 --> 01:03:31,370
Speaker 1: However, I will say this it was partially rims But I think Daryl Surratt was trying to sabotage our panel.

986
01:03:31,390 --> 01:03:38,489
Speaker 1: He was not trying to say it's with the boob because I noticed that the boob screwed him later And he was trying to bring us down with him into hell.

987
01:03:39,311 --> 01:03:41,825
Speaker 0: Okay, anyway, but yeah, that wasn't our best panel.

988
01:03:41,845 --> 01:03:45,182
Speaker 0: It didn't have enough preparation But considering that it was at 10 a.m.

989
01:03:45,242 --> 01:03:48,538
Speaker 0: Right not a lot of people showed up But considering that it was at 10 a.m.

990
01:03:48,880 --> 01:03:49,824
Speaker 0: And not a lot of people.

991
01:03:49,844 --> 01:03:51,130
Speaker 0: a lot of you was still waiting in line.

992
01:03:51,692 --> 01:03:54,103
Speaker 0: It was a lot of people considering those factors.

993
01:03:54,123 --> 01:03:55,670
Speaker 0: It just wasn't a lot of people in total.

994
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:02,153
Speaker 0: It was in the biggest panel room the same panel room they use for closing ceremonies and such and it had People.

995
01:04:02,494 --> 01:04:08,316
Speaker 1: it was you know, and also despite me thinking that that was a pretty weak panel on our part We got a lot of feedback.

996
01:04:08,336 --> 01:04:11,167
Speaker 0: We got some negative feedbacks though, which was pretty accurate.

997
01:04:11,247 --> 01:04:16,969
Speaker 0: one person was like Yeah, the con Pete the people running the panel, you know, we're sort of talking to each other about.

998
01:04:17,029 --> 01:04:19,783
Speaker 0: you know They're issues with the you know, and it was like yeah, that's exactly true.

999
01:04:19,803 --> 01:04:24,902
Speaker 0: It's cuz you didn't prepare Yeah, and in the future you will prepare this panel much much more.

1000
01:04:24,962 --> 01:04:27,370
Speaker 0: and the panels, you know, it's almost run its course anyway.

1001
01:04:27,692 --> 01:04:33,907
Speaker 0: So, yep, that was that panel Alright, so let us fast forward a little bit here.

1002
01:04:33,927 --> 01:04:44,615
Speaker 0: that point I don't want it around try to do a lot of wandering because there wasn't a lot I wanted to see right away at least, you know, I went to the artists alley, you know when it opened and Artists alley this year.

1003
01:04:45,217 --> 01:04:48,350
Speaker 0: very nice artists alley, you know just as big and awesome as last year.

1004
01:04:48,571 --> 01:04:50,461
Speaker 1: The art show was pretty solid - I gotta say.

1005
01:04:50,682 --> 01:04:50,903
Speaker 0: Yep.

1006
01:04:51,024 --> 01:04:52,210
Speaker 0: Our show was pretty solid.

1007
01:04:52,250 --> 01:04:54,370
Speaker 0: I mean there wasn't anything in the art show that blew me away.

1008
01:04:54,792 --> 01:05:00,198
Speaker 0: I did notice there was the giant big old statue though That was something epic to behold.

1009
01:05:00,258 --> 01:05:07,047
Speaker 1: and if I if I had not just like purchased a house I kind of considered it because that would have been a cool thing to own.

1010
01:05:07,067 --> 01:05:07,670
Speaker 1: it wasn't that it.

1011
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:13,861
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing was it was like you had to You know basically pay for shipping of the thing, which is like $1,000.

1012
01:05:13,861 --> 01:05:16,130
Speaker 0: and I'm wondering how did they ship it to Otacon?

1013
01:05:16,330 --> 01:05:17,637
Speaker 0: And did anyone buy it?

1014
01:05:17,697 --> 01:05:20,029
Speaker 0: You know, it's like whoa, really sort.

1015
01:05:20,069 --> 01:05:24,102
Speaker 1: of course It's partly you ship it to Otacon just to show it off like look why I rot.

1016
01:05:24,343 --> 01:05:24,564
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1017
01:05:24,584 --> 01:05:26,570
Speaker 1: Look ye mighty ye not guilty.

1018
01:05:26,670 --> 01:05:27,574
Speaker 0: They're also a lot of.

1019
01:05:27,614 --> 01:05:33,421
Speaker 0: there are also more models in the modeling contest in the art show Which I thought was pretty interesting.

1020
01:05:33,441 --> 01:05:34,710
Speaker 1: and I modeling is coming back.

1021
01:05:34,831 --> 01:05:38,470
Speaker 0: I think modeling is coming back and princess tutu is coming is making a research.

1022
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:41,623
Speaker 1: I think we are primarily responsible for princess tutu's comeback.

1023
01:05:41,663 --> 01:05:43,310
Speaker 0: I don't think we're responsible for the modeling comeback.

1024
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:45,879
Speaker 0: We're not but princess tutu definitely needs to come back.

1025
01:05:45,919 --> 01:05:46,601
Speaker 0: He's the come.

1026
01:05:46,902 --> 01:05:49,170
Speaker 0: it's a come for princess tutu and a come for modeling.

1027
01:05:50,037 --> 01:06:00,290
Speaker 1: Anyway Our friend speaking of that Every year we always go to the 18-plus section of the art show because it is invariably hilarious and it did not disappoint.

1028
01:06:00,672 --> 01:06:01,977
Speaker 0: Yep, there was some funny stuff in there.

1029
01:06:02,319 --> 01:06:04,890
Speaker 0: Our friend Eric Marisak was doing his awesome chalk arts.

1030
01:06:05,051 --> 01:06:10,295
Speaker 0: Yep, I did, you know pretty much he did the Otacon con book cover Nice crabs.

1031
01:06:10,335 --> 01:06:13,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, his stuff is always impressive and he's at like every time.

1032
01:06:13,190 --> 01:06:16,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, you go to a nerdy con be it, you know, I think he's gonna be a Pax.

1033
01:06:16,471 --> 01:06:18,883
Speaker 0: He's at New York anime festival New York comic-con.

1034
01:06:18,923 --> 01:06:20,190
Speaker 0: He's at all sorts of cons.

1035
01:06:20,713 --> 01:06:24,010
Speaker 0: Eric Marisak is the guy who's always doing the chalk art on the big piece of paper.

1036
01:06:24,533 --> 01:06:26,001
Speaker 0: Definitely stop and say hi to him.

1037
01:06:26,101 --> 01:06:26,765
Speaker 0: He's really cool.

1038
01:06:26,906 --> 01:06:27,650
Speaker 0: He's really cool.

1039
01:06:27,972 --> 01:06:30,190
Speaker 0: He likes to take a break, you know from drawing his chalk.

1040
01:06:30,331 --> 01:06:32,463
Speaker 0: So if you go and talk to him, he'll stand up and talk to you.

1041
01:06:32,503 --> 01:06:33,529
Speaker 0: just we can give his arm a rest.

1042
01:06:34,034 --> 01:06:35,709
Speaker 0: You know, he's got a lot of cool stuff to say.

1043
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:39,930
Speaker 0: I learned that he gets the chalk in bulk really cheap from this company that doesn't have a website.

1044
01:06:40,111 --> 01:06:41,481
Speaker 0: So, you know that it's.

1045
01:06:41,783 --> 01:06:50,710
Speaker 1: that's something to keep in mind This vision of buying Like just tons and tons and tons of it and just giving it to a whole to everyone in line at Otacon.

1046
01:06:50,730 --> 01:06:51,750
Speaker 0: That's what I was about to say.

1047
01:06:51,770 --> 01:06:56,029
Speaker 0: I would you know remember at Pax when he waited in line to give everyone pipe cleaners about.

1048
01:06:56,049 --> 01:06:58,718
Speaker 1: you know Another example of Pax being awesome.

1049
01:06:58,759 --> 01:07:01,910
Speaker 1: Good God, but there was this crazy line that was gonna be like two hours long.

1050
01:07:02,332 --> 01:07:11,230
Speaker 1: so Pax enforcers just went and got like all this pipe cleaner and Just pass it out in bulk and said do what thou wilt and everyone made awesome crafts in line at Otacon.

1051
01:07:11,632 --> 01:07:14,664
Speaker 0: People are taking you know people in line some stupid morons in line.

1052
01:07:14,684 --> 01:07:21,470
Speaker 0: These were attendees, by the way We're using like permanent marker to like draw on, you know, basically vandalize the city while they were alive.

1053
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:23,678
Speaker 1: Jackass is because because it was Otacon.

1054
01:07:23,718 --> 01:07:24,381
Speaker 1: It was the BCC.

1055
01:07:24,461 --> 01:07:26,488
Speaker 1: Otacon probably had to cover the cleaning of that.

1056
01:07:26,729 --> 01:07:27,555
Speaker 0: Yep Who knows?

1057
01:07:27,596 --> 01:07:28,100
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know.

1058
01:07:28,141 --> 01:07:28,908
Speaker 0: it could have just been.

1059
01:07:28,928 --> 01:07:36,190
Speaker 0: you know That the city because it's not remember remember and any issue regarding the line or outside the con Otacon does communicate with the city.

1060
01:07:36,492 --> 01:07:38,670
Speaker 0: But I think it does, you know, it is the city's responsibility.

1061
01:07:38,992 --> 01:07:42,328
Speaker 1: Yes, but if it's on the convention center, there might be agreements to the.

1062
01:07:42,348 --> 01:07:42,710
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1063
01:07:42,952 --> 01:07:45,510
Speaker 0: I have no idea how that works regardless up in the jackasses.

1064
01:07:45,631 --> 01:07:54,190
Speaker 1: But if we just bought chalk in bulk The kids wouldn't use the Sharpie to draw the penis when they can use the perfectly easily wash off chalk to draw the penis

1065
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:59,550
Speaker 0: Yep, and that also would have occupied people in line, you know who are bored and sitting there for hours and hours.

1066
01:07:59,610 --> 01:08:04,489
Speaker 0: They should just hand it out chalk to the whole line and I bet there are plenty of artists out in line.

1067
01:08:04,529 --> 01:08:08,774
Speaker 0: artists People who could have drawn some really good stuff out on this You know and it would have.

1068
01:08:09,095 --> 01:08:22,049
Speaker 0: also as people drove by after the line cleared They would have seen all this awesome anime arts all over, you know And they probably the only thing that you probably what I had to do was get some sort of permit from the city and Otacon Already probably has to get a bunch of permits from the city.

1069
01:08:22,831 --> 01:08:24,357
Speaker 0: How much work is one more permit?

1070
01:08:24,417 --> 01:08:25,823
Speaker 1: really think about our economy.

1071
01:08:25,843 --> 01:08:34,170
Speaker 0: that art festival is going on at the same time I think Baltimore would be anyone about yeah, and it would have made, you know The convention center look totally Otacon styling during Otacon would've been awesome.

1072
01:08:34,752 --> 01:08:37,430
Speaker 0: You know, it's that kind of creative thinking that you know people need to work on.

1073
01:08:37,529 --> 01:08:39,578
Speaker 1: Anyway, they're they're lucky because I didn't know about this.

1074
01:08:39,618 --> 01:08:42,828
Speaker 1: My other plan was to buy like 10,000 kazoos in bulk.

1075
01:08:43,930 --> 01:08:50,613
Speaker 1: Haha, I mean if you think butts got ya butts got ya was annoying imagine Thousand kazoos.

1076
01:08:50,934 --> 01:08:51,055
Speaker 0: Yep.

1077
01:08:51,075 --> 01:08:54,850
Speaker 0: All right thing is, you know, I don't you want to talk about the butt-scratching or just skip it.

1078
01:08:54,850 --> 01:08:55,469
Speaker 0: We should mention it.

1079
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:59,283
Speaker 0: So so apparently I heard I didn't hear anyone at the con actually say this.

1080
01:08:59,344 --> 01:08:59,585
Speaker 0: never.

1081
01:08:59,706 --> 01:09:08,787
Speaker 0: once in post Con a lot of people complained that people were saying butt-scratch up And I didn't know what the deal was.

1082
01:09:08,828 --> 01:09:12,066
Speaker 0: butt-scratcher I thought it was some sort of 4chan thing sort of like seeking fuck.

1083
01:09:12,086 --> 01:09:12,770
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

1084
01:09:13,613 --> 01:09:19,084
Speaker 0: But later on after we got home We did a YouTube search for butt-scratch up and we found out what it was.

1085
01:09:19,124 --> 01:09:20,870
Speaker 0: and actually I kind of think it's it's funny.

1086
01:09:21,051 --> 01:09:38,990
Speaker 1: Well, it was funny because well one it's an interesting exercise in memes and I don't want to get into that But we've talked about that a lot and it is like this beautiful example of the fitness of a meme and that's and the Susceptibility of people different kinds of memes but someone posted in the Otacon forum cuz someone was like, where did that start?

1087
01:09:39,069 --> 01:09:41,782
Speaker 1: Oh my god, and this guy was like, sorry guys.

1088
01:09:41,942 --> 01:09:43,790
Speaker 1: I think it was me and I'm not kidding.

1089
01:09:44,555 --> 01:09:50,850
Speaker 1: basically There were all those people like bums and people with permits walking up and down the pregrudge line and the line Friday morning.

1090
01:09:51,211 --> 01:09:52,578
Speaker 1: they're like ice cold water.

1091
01:09:52,638 --> 01:09:54,969
Speaker 1: get you ice cold water here trying to sell, you know water.

1092
01:09:54,989 --> 01:09:58,739
Speaker 1: and One guy in line after every time they walked by.

1093
01:09:58,759 --> 01:10:01,568
Speaker 1: I was like but scotch I get you but scotch.

1094
01:10:01,588 --> 01:10:11,527
Speaker 1: Ah, but scotch I make fun of those guys and apparently just started spreading up and down the line and it echoed for the entire Convention even though I never heard it once.

1095
01:10:12,312 --> 01:10:13,536
Speaker 0: That tells me how big this con is.

1096
01:10:13,677 --> 01:10:14,620
Speaker 0: that there was a nut.

1097
01:10:14,641 --> 01:10:17,874
Speaker 0: it was enough of a problem that multiple people complained about it But it was all.

1098
01:10:17,955 --> 01:10:20,730
Speaker 0: it wasn't big enough that I found out about it.

1099
01:10:20,791 --> 01:10:22,230
Speaker 1: The thing is for anyone to complain about that.

1100
01:10:22,270 --> 01:10:23,736
Speaker 1: There's nothing you can do about me.

1101
01:10:24,017 --> 01:10:27,370
Speaker 1: the people who go to anime cons are more susceptible to memes than average people.

1102
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,754
Speaker 0: You already took away the signs.

1103
01:10:28,854 --> 01:10:29,697
Speaker 0: It's a good move.

1104
01:10:29,737 --> 01:10:31,102
Speaker 0: You can't take away yelling stuff.

1105
01:10:31,202 --> 01:10:33,028
Speaker 1: It can't take away the butt-scratcher, right?

1106
01:10:33,068 --> 01:10:37,965
Speaker 0: So Also the video game room at Otacon was oh my god.

1107
01:10:38,346 --> 01:10:39,310
Speaker 0: It was actually quite good.

1108
01:10:39,330 --> 01:10:41,310
Speaker 0: I mean, it's pretty much the same as it's been in years past.

1109
01:10:41,350 --> 01:10:42,897
Speaker 1: They had these pump machines in the corner.

1110
01:10:42,937 --> 01:10:43,681
Speaker 1: that was rocking.

1111
01:10:43,902 --> 01:10:45,670
Speaker 0: people were actually saying the pump machines are really good.

1112
01:10:45,690 --> 01:10:47,808
Speaker 0: They didn't have a GDS DDR but not machines of DDR.

1113
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:52,724
Speaker 0: Anyway, I actually played you know, the sort of quirky Japanese shmups.

1114
01:10:52,784 --> 01:10:54,590
Speaker 0: I played this one little star, whatever.

1115
01:10:54,790 --> 01:10:56,797
Speaker 0: Well, we played the twinkle star whatever for the.

1116
01:10:56,817 --> 01:10:58,261
Speaker 0: I guess it was the ps2 version.

1117
01:10:58,301 --> 01:10:59,324
Speaker 1: became is so great.

1118
01:10:59,385 --> 01:11:02,473
Speaker 0: It's the versus witches Monster.

1119
01:11:02,533 --> 01:11:04,622
Speaker 0: shoot him up space shooter shmup, right?

1120
01:11:04,984 --> 01:11:06,370
Speaker 0: We also played.

1121
01:11:07,833 --> 01:11:10,530
Speaker 0: I played this game that was basically saying it was the Sega Saturn game.

1122
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:14,205
Speaker 0: That was basically Gradius, but you had all these different characters you could choose from.

1123
01:11:14,245 --> 01:11:15,350
Speaker 0: you could choose the Gradius ship.

1124
01:11:15,831 --> 01:11:25,520
Speaker 0: You could also choose like stick figure riding a paper airplane or flying pig or all these other like the dragon guy You know sitting on a rocket all this sort of stuff and it was.

1125
01:11:25,922 --> 01:11:27,950
Speaker 0: it was a pretty good Gradius game and infinite continues.

1126
01:11:28,111 --> 01:11:28,514
Speaker 0: It was fun.

1127
01:11:28,554 --> 01:11:33,510
Speaker 0: I also played this Xbox 360 game That was sort of a versus shmup.

1128
01:11:33,739 --> 01:11:37,846
Speaker 0: You know It's sort of like a versus bullet hell where you charge up and you turn into a boss and everything.

1129
01:11:37,886 --> 01:11:38,288
Speaker 0: and it was.

1130
01:11:38,529 --> 01:11:43,530
Speaker 0: it's a pretty Good game and you know, so there is some interesting stuff going on in the Otacon video game room.

1131
01:11:43,690 --> 01:11:47,985
Speaker 0: And you know, actually the time I went there was like right away on Saturday or Sunday.

1132
01:11:48,005 --> 01:11:49,893
Speaker 0: no right away on Saturday I went in there.

1133
01:11:49,934 --> 01:11:58,310
Speaker 0: I think just like immediately as soon as the con opened and You know, I said it wasn't too crowded when I was in there They had to wait in line and you know, I had a good old time.

1134
01:11:58,410 --> 01:12:04,086
Speaker 0: But apparently, you know when it was crowded there was of course issues But I was not party to them as I was there very early on Saturday.

1135
01:12:04,126 --> 01:12:09,067
Speaker 0: Yeah So yes good time in the video game room at Otacon any uh, you know, it does like.

1136
01:12:09,087 --> 01:12:09,710
Speaker 0: why the dealers room?

1137
01:12:09,972 --> 01:12:17,570
Speaker 0: Right dealers room at Otacon There was a lot less industry presence because the industry is down in the crapper, right?

1138
01:12:17,850 --> 01:12:22,210
Speaker 0: You know, there was like a media blasters booth and a funimation and that even those industry booths are much smaller.

1139
01:12:22,532 --> 01:12:30,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, but however in years past Otacon is you know, the way the dealers room has worked is they would still have this big industry space, right?

1140
01:12:30,670 --> 01:12:40,410
Speaker 0: They would just be less and smaller industry booths resulting in one area of the dealers room being sort of airy and wide open And the rest of the dealers room being, you know booths booths booths booths booths.

1141
01:12:41,252 --> 01:12:48,410
Speaker 0: The thing is this year they crammed the whole thing with booze booze booze booze booze, you know as the whole there was equal tightness.

1142
01:12:48,450 --> 01:12:49,315
Speaker 0: No, it wasn't tight.

1143
01:12:49,576 --> 01:12:54,650
Speaker 0: All the aisles were wide and comfortable, you know You were never cramped unless you wanted to get up close to a booth.

1144
01:12:54,911 --> 01:12:58,650
Speaker 1: But there were just a ton of smaller vendors with a lot of really interesting stuff.

1145
01:12:58,911 --> 01:13:01,659
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean it wasn't like some great great dealers room.

1146
01:13:01,679 --> 01:13:03,203
Speaker 0: There weren't amazing deals.

1147
01:13:03,564 --> 01:13:04,667
Speaker 0: There weren't like that.

1148
01:13:04,728 --> 01:13:10,770
Speaker 1: I gotta say Sadly enough, you know the deep discount DVD like 25% off sale was also going on during Otacon.

1149
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:18,650
Speaker 1: Yeah But here's what I noticed No dealer had a deal that even came close to just the standard Amazon price on freaking any DVDs.

1150
01:13:18,991 --> 01:13:23,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean the ones that did have deals like the always awesome sci-fi continuum.

1151
01:13:23,730 --> 01:13:23,931
Speaker 0: It was.

1152
01:13:24,132 --> 01:13:31,369
Speaker 0: I've already cleaned out sci-fi continuum and you're in all the 20 conventions I've seen them at so they didn't have anything left for me to clean them out of.

1153
01:13:32,221 --> 01:13:37,084
Speaker 0: so anyway You know if you're looking for treasures or if you're looking for deals.

1154
01:13:37,124 --> 01:13:42,645
Speaker 0: the Otacon dealers room didn't have it But what he did have was quantity and what it did have actually was model kits.

1155
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:45,763
Speaker 0: there was and you know There was just there's some resurgence.

1156
01:13:45,803 --> 01:13:46,810
Speaker 0: I noticed the anime Boston.

1157
01:13:46,950 --> 01:13:47,895
Speaker 0: I noticed it at Otacon.

1158
01:13:47,935 --> 01:13:49,121
Speaker 1: Oh now an anime Boston.

1159
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:50,870
Speaker 1: Scott was like, I think there's a resurgence.

1160
01:13:50,950 --> 01:13:52,275
Speaker 1: There's like there's more of this stuff.

1161
01:13:52,295 --> 01:13:56,970
Speaker 0: or I saw more people just anecdotally walking out of the dealer room with Gundam model kit.

1162
01:13:57,031 --> 01:13:58,850
Speaker 1: But then we get to Otacon and there's like this one.

1163
01:13:59,771 --> 01:14:03,325
Speaker 0: That's just model kits and it is packed the whole con.

1164
01:14:03,365 --> 01:14:04,730
Speaker 0: it was a poorly laid-out booth.

1165
01:14:04,851 --> 01:14:07,770
Speaker 0: It was hard to walk around in this one-way maze, right?

1166
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,639
Speaker 0: But they had model kits.

1167
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:11,610
Speaker 0: people were at the booth was constantly crowded.

1168
01:14:11,630 --> 01:14:14,769
Speaker 0: There was always someone at the cash register for as long as the dealers room was open.

1169
01:14:15,372 --> 01:14:21,670
Speaker 0: They had good stuff and I saw lots of model kits being sold and I saw Lots more of them at in the dealers room in general.

1170
01:14:22,212 --> 01:14:27,008
Speaker 0: so model kits are making a comeback at the dealer rooms in the cons and that is a good thing.

1171
01:14:27,108 --> 01:14:32,450
Speaker 0: I say and That's that's you know, that's really all there is to say about the Otacon dealers room.

1172
01:14:32,590 --> 01:14:33,997
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean, it's it's a dealers room.

1173
01:14:34,017 --> 01:14:34,620
Speaker 0: They sell stuff.

1174
01:14:35,243 --> 01:14:36,449
Speaker 1: now in terms of panels, right?

1175
01:14:36,489 --> 01:14:39,950
Speaker 1: Obviously I'm not gonna talk about every panel I went to but I saw some pretty good panels.

1176
01:14:40,071 --> 01:14:52,384
Speaker 1: I didn't see any bad panels, but I'll point out way in the end in the con feedback session Numerous people complained not you know, oh, they're bad panels But that there are a few panels that happen every year by the same people every year.

1177
01:14:52,404 --> 01:14:56,056
Speaker 1: that are terrible every year Yep, but I skipped all those.

1178
01:14:56,417 --> 01:14:57,602
Speaker 1: but one thing Otacon did.

1179
01:14:57,662 --> 01:14:59,870
Speaker 1: that was great and I'm glad they did this.

1180
01:14:59,930 --> 01:15:01,695
Speaker 1: They need to never stop doing this.

1181
01:15:02,316 --> 01:15:05,365
Speaker 1: They made a 15-minute break between every single panel.

1182
01:15:05,405 --> 01:15:07,330
Speaker 1: panels did not abut against each other.

1183
01:15:07,613 --> 01:15:08,709
Speaker 0: Yep, that was very good.

1184
01:15:08,911 --> 01:15:18,165
Speaker 1: So as a result unlike every other Otacon ever when we had a panel we would be in the room We'd be set up the time would start and our panel would start immediately and it was great.

1185
01:15:18,547 --> 01:15:19,550
Speaker 1: They're like brilliant Otacon.

1186
01:15:19,610 --> 01:15:20,255
Speaker 1: I'm glad you did that.

1187
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:21,825
Speaker 1: It made panels a million times better.

1188
01:15:22,288 --> 01:15:29,515
Speaker 0: Yep Another thing they did is they made it very clear when there would be a room clear and when they would not if there was No scheduled room clear.

1189
01:15:29,775 --> 01:15:42,270
Speaker 0: the room would not clear and if there was a scheduled room clear the room would clear and the only times They really scheduled room clears were like before the vamps panel, you know a very crowded panel before 18-plus starts in the room.

1190
01:15:42,350 --> 01:15:56,530
Speaker 0: You know obvious reasons and if there was some sort of reason that they had to do a room clear Like I heard that there was a technical difficulty in one of the rooms where they had to do some rewiring For liability reasons they had to do a room clear because they couldn't rewire it while there are people in there.

1191
01:15:56,891 --> 01:16:02,086
Speaker 0: You know just in case something happened insurance, etc, etc, and you know, and that is perfectly understandable.

1192
01:16:02,247 --> 01:16:09,550
Speaker 1: So again great I mean Otacon base exactly what they should have done Other than because we might not mention everything in the show exactly what they did do what they should have done.

1193
01:16:09,670 --> 01:16:18,210
Speaker 1: Yes, other than the big bad things we talked about at the beginning of the show every part of Otacon was just great Yep, like pretty much without question.

1194
01:16:18,451 --> 01:16:22,690
Speaker 0: So that's that's the thing is usually like if it was your first con right you're just gonna be like, oh man, this is awesome.

1195
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:23,685
Speaker 0: Oh, man, this is awesome.

1196
01:16:23,767 --> 01:16:31,470
Speaker 0: Oh, man this right the thing is we sort of take all those for granted because we've been going for so long and They tend not to stick out to us and we don't make a big deal out of them.

1197
01:16:31,570 --> 01:16:34,860
Speaker 0: so we tend to focus on the negative and the thing is any.

1198
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:41,841
Speaker 1: you know, anything that wasn't negative was totally awesome and In fact, I this was probably my most fun Otacon in years.

1199
01:16:42,223 --> 01:16:42,383
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1200
01:16:42,403 --> 01:16:48,310
Speaker 0: I know it's like in recent years going to cons I've sort of like been disenchanted with actually doing events at cons.

1201
01:16:48,793 --> 01:16:50,060
Speaker 0: It's only been running the events.

1202
01:16:50,100 --> 01:16:50,925
Speaker 0: that entertains me.

1203
01:16:51,005 --> 01:16:54,878
Speaker 0: going to the events You know I've sort of been disenchanted and I'm not too excited about.

1204
01:16:54,898 --> 01:17:01,770
Speaker 0: but this year actually went to some panels and went to Stuff and I enjoyed going to stuff and it was awesome again.

1205
01:17:01,951 --> 01:17:06,170
Speaker 0: So, you know that was that was cool and it made this Otacon pretty great.

1206
01:17:06,491 --> 01:17:16,248
Speaker 1: The other thing is that we actually and this is totally a non Otacon aside But it's hard to eat anywhere in Baltimore cuz one Like everything's going out of business because Baltimore is not doing so.

1207
01:17:16,268 --> 01:17:18,730
Speaker 1: well Nope, and to the power plant are full of jerks.

1208
01:17:18,770 --> 01:17:19,335
Speaker 1: We'll get to that.

1209
01:17:19,516 --> 01:17:21,170
Speaker 1: and the restaurant we wanted to go to was closed.

1210
01:17:21,270 --> 01:17:24,888
Speaker 1: Anyway, and three everything closes early and four there's Otacon.

1211
01:17:25,331 --> 01:17:28,444
Speaker 1: So everything that isn't closed or expensive is crazy crowded.

1212
01:17:28,464 --> 01:17:28,725
Speaker 1: You can't.

1213
01:17:28,765 --> 01:17:31,029
Speaker 0: even if it's not crazy crowded It takes forever to eat.

1214
01:17:31,130 --> 01:17:35,727
Speaker 0: So like every time we wanted to eat it always took way long way longer than it had in the past.

1215
01:17:36,008 --> 01:17:52,574
Speaker 0: and I'm actually Considering next year like for lunches at least just buying the food from the overpriced con vendors because Even though it might be overpriced and not so good It'll fill me up and it'll be done quickly and I can have a lot more con time and that is worth that slightly Exaggerated price.

1216
01:17:53,016 --> 01:17:56,388
Speaker 1: but the secret is to go to expensive places.

1217
01:17:56,448 --> 01:18:01,070
Speaker 1: a Friday night We got the front row crew together and we just went to the Capitol Grill, which is this great chain.

1218
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:06,009
Speaker 0: It still takes a long time, but it takes as long as the Capitol Grill takes didn't take extra long, you know.

1219
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:12,310
Speaker 1: Yep, there was no one in there but us and we had a very expensive awesome liquor filled steak dinner.

1220
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:12,812
Speaker 1: It was great.

1221
01:18:13,113 --> 01:18:13,915
Speaker 0: Of course, you know.

1222
01:18:14,056 --> 01:18:22,930
Speaker 0: as a result, you know, we were in a rush to get to events that happened around meals You know and I think next year I'm just gonna eat lunch in the con, but I'll still take the time for the dinners.

1223
01:18:22,970 --> 01:18:25,867
Speaker 1: I think the fancy dinner Friday night at Otacon is now a tradition.

1224
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:27,623
Speaker 0: Oh, yes I'm not saying anything about the dinner.

1225
01:18:27,663 --> 01:18:35,229
Speaker 0: the dinner will stay Yeah But the lunch I think I'm gonna eat lunch at the con next year just to have more time and not be rushing to get to events after a meal.

1226
01:18:35,992 --> 01:18:43,610
Speaker 1: You know, I didn't get to go see Ava 1.0 But actually I found out glad we didn't because the projector was screwy and apparently the concert next door was super loud.

1227
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:47,150
Speaker 0: I also heard it was the dub which I didn't have any interest in seeing if I would have known that.

1228
01:18:47,411 --> 01:18:54,487
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but the thing was, you know, I was I did want to get to the event at the time Before I knew these things post-hoc.

1229
01:18:55,450 --> 01:18:59,650
Speaker 0: So, you know, I wasn't able to because my you know, I had to eat anyway

1230
01:19:00,132 --> 01:19:04,653
Speaker 1: Yep, but I don't know what else really happened on Friday and every part of the con was great Yep,

1231
01:19:05,075 --> 01:19:07,183
Speaker 0: I mean, let me try to think of some of the panels I went to.

1232
01:19:07,203 --> 01:19:08,869
Speaker 0: I don't remember when these panels were.

1233
01:19:08,889 --> 01:19:10,513
Speaker 0: I Went to.

1234
01:19:10,713 --> 01:19:16,293
Speaker 1: the ones I really think about are the ones they went to on Sunday the Murayama the show the shot You girl.

1235
01:19:16,373 --> 01:19:16,875
Speaker 1: Yeah shot.

1236
01:19:16,975 --> 01:19:20,189
Speaker 1: Yeah, I always said showed until I was corrected by shot.

1237
01:19:20,349 --> 01:19:24,384
Speaker 0: Yep Um, I went to this kung best kung kung fu fight panel.

1238
01:19:24,585 --> 01:19:25,047
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1239
01:19:25,067 --> 01:19:25,890
Speaker 1: That was a great panel.

1240
01:19:26,111 --> 01:19:26,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was.

1241
01:19:26,675 --> 01:19:29,693
Speaker 0: I mean, you know, some people were complaining about it but you know what.

1242
01:19:29,854 --> 01:19:36,321
Speaker 0: I saw some videos of some awesome fight scenes from movies and There were ones I hadn't seen before and I learned some things.

1243
01:19:36,361 --> 01:19:42,380
Speaker 1: I didn't know and regardless of you know, I Went to the panel with Daryl Daryl Surratt.

1244
01:19:42,400 --> 01:19:47,739
Speaker 0: So we were sitting there and yeah, regardless of any other flaws in this in the panel I took some pause.

1245
01:19:47,779 --> 01:19:49,628
Speaker 0: I took positives away from it and I liked it.

1246
01:19:50,171 --> 01:19:55,246
Speaker 1: Well, I had never seen that, you know end weapons of the why and that was like the best fight.

1247
01:19:55,567 --> 01:19:56,630
Speaker 0: That was pretty great.

1248
01:19:56,831 --> 01:19:59,461
Speaker 0: Oh my god, I can't believe that cop and I fight.

1249
01:19:59,501 --> 01:20:00,285
Speaker 0: that was pretty good too.

1250
01:20:00,305 --> 01:20:03,435
Speaker 1: Yeah little too Realistic when it ends.

1251
01:20:03,797 --> 01:20:06,550
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was that was a little you know, but that's what made it cool.

1252
01:20:06,550 --> 01:20:07,841
Speaker 0: There's a realistic knife fight.

1253
01:20:08,063 --> 01:20:11,585
Speaker 0: Yeah This you want to talk about any of the concerts at the con.

1254
01:20:11,605 --> 01:20:12,470
Speaker 0: I didn't go to any of them.

1255
01:20:12,490 --> 01:20:13,956
Speaker 0: I didn't attempt to go to any of them.

1256
01:20:13,976 --> 01:20:17,310
Speaker 1: We just didn't have time but from what I gather the concerts were all pretty badass.

1257
01:20:17,673 --> 01:20:19,647
Speaker 0: Yeah, there were some complaints I heard.

1258
01:20:20,891 --> 01:20:21,978
Speaker 1: those can all be alleviated.

1259
01:20:22,018 --> 01:20:25,374
Speaker 1: most of the complaints where the people said a The concerts were too loud.

1260
01:20:25,414 --> 01:20:31,213
Speaker 1: the answer if you ever go to go to concert that's not like symphonic music without musicians earplugs You're dumb.

1261
01:20:31,494 --> 01:20:31,755
Speaker 0: Yep.

1262
01:20:31,836 --> 01:20:32,479
Speaker 1: Just that's it.

1263
01:20:32,740 --> 01:20:33,263
Speaker 1: You're wrong.

1264
01:20:33,464 --> 01:20:34,690
Speaker 0: Well, there was one thing though.

1265
01:20:34,750 --> 01:20:37,170
Speaker 0: Is that you go to anime Boston in the big panel rooms?

1266
01:20:37,430 --> 01:20:44,150
Speaker 0: They have speakers at the front and speakers in the middle and that allows them to keep the volume down and allows people to hear The panelists regardless of where they sit.

1267
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,395
Speaker 1: Why does Otakon fail at that?

1268
01:20:45,475 --> 01:20:47,824
Speaker 0: Otakon only has speakers in the front of the room.

1269
01:20:47,864 --> 01:20:49,250
Speaker 0: the result and they turn them up loud.

1270
01:20:49,350 --> 01:20:57,625
Speaker 0: So the people in the back in here and the result is that if we're sitting up front is too loud And you were sitting in the back is too quiet Pay for an extra set of speakers in every room

1271
01:20:57,866 --> 01:20:58,450
Speaker 1: our panels

1272
01:20:58,630 --> 01:20:59,031
Speaker 0: necessary

1273
01:20:59,091 --> 01:21:11,709
Speaker 1: in the Hilton on Saturday where it was very difficult for us because there was this crazy echo because of the really Crappy audio setup and Otakon is a crappy audio setup and all the panel rooms every year and they always have.

1274
01:21:11,749 --> 01:21:12,091
Speaker 1: you know What.

1275
01:21:12,632 --> 01:21:13,536
Speaker 1: it's a solved problem.

1276
01:21:13,596 --> 01:21:14,720
Speaker 1: anime Boston does it.

1277
01:21:14,760 --> 01:21:16,225
Speaker 1: just fine do it that way.

1278
01:21:16,245 --> 01:21:19,054
Speaker 1: and if the Union says otherwise Well, they just.

1279
01:21:19,074 --> 01:21:19,556
Speaker 0: I think they just.

1280
01:21:19,596 --> 01:21:24,298
Speaker 0: I think my guess is that the only thing they would have to do is pay DSL more money for more.

1281
01:21:24,318 --> 01:21:26,890
Speaker 0: for two extra speakers you have to in each of the two.

1282
01:21:27,030 --> 01:21:28,655
Speaker 0: There's only two large panel rooms, right?

1283
01:21:28,675 --> 01:21:30,802
Speaker 0: So four speakers would solve this problem

1284
01:21:30,942 --> 01:21:31,383
Speaker 1: trivially

1285
01:21:31,504 --> 01:21:41,730
Speaker 0: and I guess in some of the larger video rooms I'm I don't know what the speakers are like in there But in panel four and panel six just put an extra pair of speakers in the middle of the room and turn the volume down.

1286
01:21:41,830 --> 01:21:51,210
Speaker 1: The other complaint was that at the when the one idol gave her announcement like this is my last song Half the audience ran out of the room to get in line for like autographs and crap.

1287
01:21:51,250 --> 01:21:51,795
Speaker 0: Well, I think they.

1288
01:21:51,896 --> 01:21:53,430
Speaker 0: I think it might have been for autographs.

1289
01:21:53,490 --> 01:21:56,809
Speaker 0: I think it was also a swag line and it was very, you know.

1290
01:21:57,090 --> 01:22:04,641
Speaker 1: The only thing I can say about that is there's nothing Otakon can do about the fact that the majority of fans The anime cons are super disrespectful of Japanese guests in general.

1291
01:22:04,801 --> 01:22:07,330
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're super disrespectful of just anything in general.

1292
01:22:07,370 --> 01:22:13,370
Speaker 0: It's like it's like so weird these people come to this con and I mean, I guess if autographs your thing That's understandable.

1293
01:22:13,510 --> 01:22:22,501
Speaker 0: but people come and wait in hours and hours in line for an autograph or a free swag and they put that as a higher priority Than like all this other stuff and I just don't understand it.

1294
01:22:22,722 --> 01:22:26,989
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's not even that they're trying to be disrespectful It's just that they care about free like garbage.

1295
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:34,990
Speaker 0: Yeah they care about someone signing a piece of paper or Getting a free piece of crap that they're just gonna throw away or put in a drawer and ever look at again.

1296
01:22:35,010 --> 01:22:43,339
Speaker 0: I mean more than they care about, you know sitting and enjoying someone's wonderful music or you know talking with someone or see learning things at a panel.

1297
01:22:43,459 --> 01:22:50,370
Speaker 1: the autograph I can understand because you get that couple of moments to like say Something like if you are the biggest biggest biggest fan of like Trigon.

1298
01:22:50,551 --> 01:22:53,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean who are you really the biggest biggest biggest fan of this person?

1299
01:22:53,965 --> 01:22:55,210
Speaker 0: more than anyone else in the world?

1300
01:22:55,530 --> 01:22:56,394
Speaker 1: There are people who are.

1301
01:22:56,554 --> 01:22:58,702
Speaker 0: there are but hundreds and hundreds and I.

1302
01:22:58,803 --> 01:22:59,787
Speaker 1: it's so weird.

1303
01:23:00,108 --> 01:23:01,722
Speaker 1: It is though I've seen.

1304
01:23:01,843 --> 01:23:09,350
Speaker 1: I don't get it I've seen evidence of it But the people who complained that like I was the hundred thousandth person in line and they didn't sign my autograph.

1305
01:23:09,652 --> 01:23:10,237
Speaker 1: What the shit.

1306
01:23:10,317 --> 01:23:11,184
Speaker 1: those people are just wrong.

1307
01:23:11,466 --> 01:23:13,213
Speaker 0: Yeah All right.

1308
01:23:13,273 --> 01:23:15,406
Speaker 0: What else can I remember from this cut?

1309
01:23:15,507 --> 01:23:17,802
Speaker 0: Oh, of course Violent movies.

1310
01:23:18,024 --> 01:23:18,590
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1311
01:23:18,690 --> 01:23:26,704
Speaker 0: so as is the tradition at Otacon late at night in a lot they have one day a lot of video showing rooms and You know, they there's some that show anime.

1312
01:23:26,804 --> 01:23:27,830
Speaker 0: one of them shows classics.

1313
01:23:27,951 --> 01:23:38,853
Speaker 0: They always show otaku no video right away at the beginning of the con, you know It's it's a. the rooms never quite fill up all the way But they always have a surprising number of people in them watching anime, you know And I want.

1314
01:23:39,034 --> 01:23:46,782
Speaker 1: I didn't get to see all the violent movies I wanted but this was the best year for violent movies since Eachie the killer, I don't know since each of the guy I think since Ebola syndrome.

1315
01:23:46,822 --> 01:23:47,244
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1316
01:23:47,424 --> 01:23:51,298
Speaker 0: Anyway, that's a different kind of best But yeah, it's better than last year in the year before.

1317
01:23:51,358 --> 01:23:59,423
Speaker 0: So anyway, we go in and on Friday I watched Machine girl light which was just a hilarious spoof on machine girl.

1318
01:23:59,564 --> 01:24:01,310
Speaker 1: It was kind of perverted.

1319
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:05,250
Speaker 0: It was a lot more funny if you had seen machine girl and had lots of innuendos, but it was funny.

1320
01:24:05,371 --> 01:24:06,118
Speaker 0: It wasn't perverted.

1321
01:24:06,199 --> 01:24:07,189
Speaker 1: the crowd was enjoying it.

1322
01:24:07,491 --> 01:24:13,010
Speaker 0: Then they showed Chanbara beauty which I found out later was based on a video game and it was not so good at all.

1323
01:24:13,255 --> 01:24:13,869
Speaker 0: It was just a bad.

1324
01:24:15,332 --> 01:24:19,630
Speaker 0: It was a just a bleh meh zombie movie based on a video game.

1325
01:24:20,233 --> 01:24:32,498
Speaker 0: one thing that was good in it that I will say is that The guy who plays the sidekick was the gut was Kuma from the live-action Gogasen drama, so I'm a big fan of that guy.

1326
01:24:32,538 --> 01:24:33,160
Speaker 0: He's he's cool.

1327
01:24:33,200 --> 01:24:38,427
Speaker 1: I like him but while you suffered through this stupid movie, I wandered off drunk.

1328
01:24:39,472 --> 01:24:42,550
Speaker 1: Good job, but the thing is I ended up in the right.

1329
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:48,220
Speaker 1: Well, basically I ended up with some of the crew and then our friend cat low water by with her friends to go to the Rave, so I just followed them.

1330
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:49,909
Speaker 0: Oh the Otakon Rave.

1331
01:24:50,594 --> 01:24:52,350
Speaker 0: This the Otakon Rave.

1332
01:24:54,630 --> 01:24:59,770
Speaker 0: It's usually doom doom doom doom doom with smelly fanboys that are real crowded.

1333
01:25:00,192 --> 01:25:06,824
Speaker 0: You know hardly anyone's dancing except for a few people who think they can breakdance Glowstick swinging around hitting everyone in the face.

1334
01:25:06,985 --> 01:25:07,690
Speaker 0: That's the Otakon Rave.

1335
01:25:07,830 --> 01:25:09,375
Speaker 1: So the rave one.

1336
01:25:09,696 --> 01:25:12,644
Speaker 1: as I'm walking up I hear music and I don't believe my ears.

1337
01:25:12,925 --> 01:25:14,530
Speaker 1: It's the Ava theme remixed.

1338
01:25:14,891 --> 01:25:17,423
Speaker 1: Oh shit, so as I get closer, I look in the room.

1339
01:25:17,905 --> 01:25:18,890
Speaker 1: I don't see any circles.

1340
01:25:19,152 --> 01:25:20,950
Speaker 1: There are glow sticks, but there's always been glow sticks.

1341
01:25:21,211 --> 01:25:25,844
Speaker 1: But there are people dancing and having a good time to techno-y anime music.

1342
01:25:25,884 --> 01:25:26,466
Speaker 0: Was it smelly?

1343
01:25:26,486 --> 01:25:26,586
Speaker 0: No.

1344
01:25:26,887 --> 01:25:29,037
Speaker 0: Wow How could it not be smelly?

1345
01:25:29,319 --> 01:25:30,990
Speaker 1: I go into the side room and I see what they did.

1346
01:25:31,050 --> 01:25:41,627
Speaker 1: They moved the lame-ass rave music into that little side room and in the main room It was just like anime remixes and upbeat music and they've kind of at least Friday night.

1347
01:25:41,667 --> 01:25:48,546
Speaker 1: They dropped that Minimalist four-beat like trance crap and it was upbeat edging on happy hardcore music.

1348
01:25:48,566 --> 01:25:49,168
Speaker 1: It was awesome.

1349
01:25:49,288 --> 01:25:55,870
Speaker 1: I danced until my frail 27 year old old man body failed me an hour and a half later and then I went to bed.

1350
01:25:56,673 --> 01:25:59,864
Speaker 0: So rave good good good on fixing the rave.

1351
01:25:59,884 --> 01:26:05,426
Speaker 0: Otakon is the first the anime music Yes, seriously, and also there were staff whatever DJ.

1352
01:26:05,466 --> 01:26:06,350
Speaker 0: that was double plus.

1353
01:26:06,550 --> 01:26:10,782
Speaker 1: I saw two different Otakon staff members break up two different circles.

1354
01:26:11,264 --> 01:26:13,008
Speaker 1: Otakon knows the score now good.

1355
01:26:13,109 --> 01:26:13,450
Speaker 0: Very good.

1356
01:26:14,011 --> 01:26:20,570
Speaker 0: Okay, so on Saturday the violent movies I saw oh my god Saturday was the best ever.

1357
01:26:20,630 --> 01:26:22,840
Speaker 0: We didn't get to see video clip.

1358
01:26:22,900 --> 01:26:25,250
Speaker 0: I saw the very end of video clip because we were at dinner.

1359
01:26:25,431 --> 01:26:26,859
Speaker 1: I was looking forward to video clip.

1360
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I from what I could tell from the ending I couldn't really tell if it was good or bad.

1361
01:26:30,859 --> 01:26:31,662
Speaker 1: I don't think it was good.

1362
01:26:31,943 --> 01:26:33,470
Speaker 0: Anyway, I saw deathbell.

1363
01:26:34,672 --> 01:26:37,210
Speaker 0: It's called deathbell because it was about a school, you know.

1364
01:26:37,270 --> 01:26:39,180
Speaker 0: So a crazy killer in a school and he would.

1365
01:26:39,281 --> 01:26:40,950
Speaker 0: you would kill people whenever the bell rang.

1366
01:26:41,090 --> 01:26:42,154
Speaker 0: So is the deathbell right?

1367
01:26:42,735 --> 01:26:46,166
Speaker 0: and actually I was expecting a you know a violent movie and it was.

1368
01:26:46,486 --> 01:26:47,650
Speaker 0: there were violent deaths.

1369
01:26:47,750 --> 01:26:54,950
Speaker 0: You know in this in a Hannibal Lecter kind of way it was very reminiscent of saw Yeah, but actually it was just sort of a good movie.

1370
01:26:55,573 --> 01:26:57,462
Speaker 0: It wasn't a great movie.

1371
01:26:57,804 --> 01:26:59,030
Speaker 0: It was just sort of good.

1372
01:26:59,130 --> 01:27:04,256
Speaker 1: There's the thing what you know sort of good in one way, but it was a little contrived Little bit it was.

1373
01:27:04,617 --> 01:27:15,525
Speaker 1: I would characterize it as the ending was supposed to be a twist, but I saw as uncomfortably violent with a Pointless twist and a confusing plot that wasn't that interesting.

1374
01:27:15,545 --> 01:27:17,834
Speaker 0: The plot wasn't confusing It was just sort of obvious I think.

1375
01:27:17,854 --> 01:27:22,010
Speaker 1: No the plot was confusing because the editing was just terrible and it jumped around all the time.

1376
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:23,218
Speaker 1: You couldn't tell who was who and it just.

1377
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,970
Speaker 0: I didn't have a problem with that.

1378
01:27:25,010 --> 01:27:28,230
Speaker 1: Well, no near the end like it would cut around to these unrelated scenes.

1379
01:27:28,632 --> 01:27:31,430
Speaker 1: But it like the cutting didn't add anything to the movie just draw.

1380
01:27:31,591 --> 01:27:33,440
Speaker 1: It was just like it drawed out the.

1381
01:27:33,520 --> 01:27:34,043
Speaker 0: it could have been.

1382
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:35,570
Speaker 0: it could have been a little bit compressed.

1383
01:27:36,132 --> 01:27:36,835
Speaker 0: You know, it was.

1384
01:27:36,855 --> 01:27:38,561
Speaker 0: it was a little bit stretched out there.

1385
01:27:38,581 --> 01:27:39,324
Speaker 1: It was pretty weak.

1386
01:27:39,385 --> 01:27:40,810
Speaker 1: It wasn't worth seeing really.

1387
01:27:40,890 --> 01:27:42,115
Speaker 1: No, I think I don't.

1388
01:27:42,195 --> 01:27:45,789
Speaker 0: I wouldn't go and say rent this or download it or spend your time to see it.

1389
01:27:46,232 --> 01:27:48,045
Speaker 0: But you know like I was.

1390
01:27:48,226 --> 01:27:51,042
Speaker 0: you know It caught my attention and I was.

1391
01:27:51,062 --> 01:27:52,690
Speaker 0: I was relatively into it.

1392
01:27:52,730 --> 01:27:54,924
Speaker 1: I was bored and like sitting on Twitter the whole time.

1393
01:27:54,984 --> 01:27:57,015
Speaker 1: It was not that good But I liked.

1394
01:27:57,115 --> 01:27:58,621
Speaker 1: I liked death bell and was it?

1395
01:27:58,681 --> 01:28:00,729
Speaker 0: I would give it a three and a half out of five.

1396
01:28:01,131 --> 01:28:04,990
Speaker 1: I give it like a two and a half out of five after death bell.

1397
01:28:05,130 --> 01:28:05,733
Speaker 1: See, there's the thing.

1398
01:28:05,753 --> 01:28:08,142
Speaker 1: death bell was only worthwhile because it was.

1399
01:28:08,162 --> 01:28:12,392
Speaker 1: it was post seeded by black Magic.

1400
01:28:12,472 --> 01:28:15,603
Speaker 1: that was like magic to that movie.

1401
01:28:16,044 --> 01:28:23,510
Speaker 0: Uh, it was basically a General voodoo Like it was a perfect movie for late-night Otakon.

1402
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:26,699
Speaker 0: It was some real doctors versus witch doctors.

1403
01:28:26,759 --> 01:28:30,330
Speaker 1: I will sum the movie up with the with the quote of the movie.

1404
01:28:30,953 --> 01:28:33,869
Speaker 1: I'm actually 80, but I look 30 because I drink breast milk.

1405
01:28:35,535 --> 01:28:45,484
Speaker 1: and then you get a uncomfortably long scene where you learn how exactly a voodoo witch doctor Gets breast milk and what he does to get it and how he used.

1406
01:28:45,545 --> 01:28:48,194
Speaker 0: the best scene in the movie was Basically the za.

1407
01:28:48,214 --> 01:28:52,570
Speaker 0: the voodoo witch doctor had these zombies and the way the zombies worked is they're basically just corpses.

1408
01:28:53,012 --> 01:28:57,690
Speaker 0: But he would hammer nails into their heads and when he did that they would turn young and you know alive.

1409
01:28:57,811 --> 01:29:00,410
Speaker 0: But they would still be zombies under his control, right?

1410
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:01,635
Speaker 1: But they would turn his racket.

1411
01:29:01,675 --> 01:29:04,989
Speaker 1: he keeps selling the same decrepit old zombie to like stars, right?

1412
01:29:05,290 --> 01:29:08,690
Speaker 0: But it looks like a young hot beautiful woman because it has the nail in her head.

1413
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:14,090
Speaker 0: Well, well, you know some guy ends up doing this young beautiful zombie chick, right?

1414
01:29:14,291 --> 01:29:21,595
Speaker 0: And when he's doing her the nail comes out of her head and while he's doing her she turns into an old zombie corpse and That is the best scene in the movie.

1415
01:29:22,036 --> 01:29:22,979
Speaker 1: That was I don't know.

1416
01:29:23,080 --> 01:29:25,990
Speaker 1: I think when he gives that woman to shave.

1417
01:29:26,231 --> 01:29:31,204
Speaker 0: Yeah, that is what I expect to see at late-night Otakon live-action movies.

1418
01:29:31,224 --> 01:29:33,310
Speaker 0: horrible fucked up shit like that.

1419
01:29:33,310 --> 01:29:38,992
Speaker 1: It is the difference between uncomfortably violent and hilariously violence or grotesque All right.

1420
01:29:39,012 --> 01:29:41,102
Speaker 0: So let's talk about our panels on Saturday.

1421
01:29:41,303 --> 01:29:42,750
Speaker 1: So on Saturday, we did anime.

1422
01:29:42,791 --> 01:29:43,825
Speaker 1: You should see the panel.

1423
01:29:44,290 --> 01:29:47,001
Speaker 1: We like always do at conventions and it turned out the same way.

1424
01:29:47,122 --> 01:29:49,913
Speaker 0: usually turns out a bunch of people show up a bunch of people enjoy it.

1425
01:29:50,214 --> 01:29:59,730
Speaker 0: the one thing I want to say is that there are people there who had been to that panel before and Apparently they have confirmed that our spread of princess tutu is working.

1426
01:30:00,091 --> 01:30:09,142
Speaker 1: You know how we spread it some more like a surprising number of people not to toot our own horn Came up to us before during after that panel and said dude.

1427
01:30:09,443 --> 01:30:10,466
Speaker 1: I came to this panel again.

1428
01:30:10,486 --> 01:30:11,730
Speaker 1: You guys are totally right.

1429
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:13,661
Speaker 1: I'll watch everything you princess tutu.

1430
01:30:14,123 --> 01:30:14,425
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1431
01:30:14,445 --> 01:30:15,189
Speaker 1: It's the best thing ever.

1432
01:30:16,130 --> 01:30:23,820
Speaker 0: There's people who cosplayed as princess tutu and they came up and told us they were cosplaying as princess tutu Because we told them to watch it at a previous anime.

1433
01:30:23,860 --> 01:30:24,663
Speaker 0: You should see panel.

1434
01:30:24,784 --> 01:30:26,190
Speaker 1: Yes, there are pictures of us.

1435
01:30:26,250 --> 01:30:33,573
Speaker 0: I gotta get their pictures of us on flicker with with them cosplaying as princess tutu and they came to our panel and it was Awesome.

1436
01:30:33,754 --> 01:30:35,670
Speaker 1: Yep, and the best thing we got the picture afterwards.

1437
01:30:35,771 --> 01:30:36,334
Speaker 1: So, you know, they're like.

1438
01:30:36,355 --> 01:30:37,261
Speaker 1: will you pose for a picture?

1439
01:30:37,281 --> 01:30:38,690
Speaker 1: and we're like, yes, you guys are awesome.

1440
01:30:38,770 --> 01:30:40,335
Speaker 0: Our panel totally worked now.

1441
01:30:40,757 --> 01:30:46,601
Speaker 0: then there was a break and we sort of just hung out in panel 4 during this panel 6 Which is in the Hilton, which is great.

1442
01:30:46,802 --> 01:30:48,010
Speaker 0: It was nice and quiet over there.

1443
01:30:48,010 --> 01:30:56,506
Speaker 0: It's like this great retreat from the con You know and at these big panel rooms and we sort of retreated over there until it was time for our another panel Beyond D&D.

1444
01:30:56,567 --> 01:31:02,710
Speaker 0: now We didn't really want to run beyond D&D because it wasn't anime related didn't really fit into Otacon.

1445
01:31:02,770 --> 01:31:08,430
Speaker 1: I originally pitched it as beyond besom but Otacon agreed that yeah No one's gonna know what that is, right.

1446
01:31:08,952 --> 01:31:12,670
Speaker 0: So we ran beyond D&D at their request even though we were slightly reluctant.

1447
01:31:12,831 --> 01:31:15,602
Speaker 0: But we ran it and it was a great running of it.

1448
01:31:15,642 --> 01:31:17,670
Speaker 0: We ran it very very well.

1449
01:31:17,973 --> 01:31:19,830
Speaker 0: We learned, you know some of the slight flaw.

1450
01:31:19,930 --> 01:31:22,139
Speaker 0: It was a great panel to begin with and we made it even better.

1451
01:31:22,722 --> 01:31:37,169
Speaker 0: The place was packed and I Think we fixed the number one problem with the panel which is that after the panel people would always come up to us and say don't trash why you trash in D&D and At people just love the panel this time they didn't come up to us and ask why we're trashing D&D.

1452
01:31:37,530 --> 01:31:41,403
Speaker 0: They respected they realized we weren't trashing D&D and that we like D&D.

1453
01:31:41,965 --> 01:31:43,510
Speaker 0: and it was just so great.

1454
01:31:43,670 --> 01:31:51,297
Speaker 0: And the panel room was full and even though it was Otacon and I felt bad that we were doing D&D at Otacon It was great and and awesome.

1455
01:31:52,079 --> 01:31:55,910
Speaker 1: now the I was honestly floored by how many people came to that panel.

1456
01:31:55,991 --> 01:31:57,390
Speaker 0: I did not expect the room to be full.

1457
01:31:57,490 --> 01:32:01,670
Speaker 0: It was panel six the biggest panel room in the hell and effectively completely full.

1458
01:32:01,971 --> 01:32:06,836
Speaker 1: it was between eight and twelve like it was so many people and they were standing in the back.

1459
01:32:07,237 --> 01:32:13,870
Speaker 1: a bunch of Otacon staffers came in partly because I Told all of them if you want to see an example of what one of our real panels go here.

1460
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:16,462
Speaker 1: So a bunch of Otacon staff kind of came in and watch from the back.

1461
01:32:16,703 --> 01:32:26,430
Speaker 1: Yeah halfway through it was great and The only trouble was unlike the rest of the convention center We're like you can kind of slip into those back touch like there are ways to escape from crowds.

1462
01:32:27,253 --> 01:32:34,950
Speaker 1: The crowd that followed us out of that panel room was unmanageable And we basically to anyone who wanted to talk to us and you eventually lost us.

1463
01:32:35,672 --> 01:32:42,034
Speaker 1: The secret is we will leave a room like that if there's no back way and walk until the crowd is manageable And then we stop.

1464
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,286
Speaker 1: yep, so if people don't just wander off.

1465
01:32:44,326 --> 01:32:51,370
Speaker 0: We'll keep walking But if not enough people wander off we'll keep walking until we get to our hotel room, but that was an epic panel.

1466
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:51,952
Speaker 1: That was amazing.

1467
01:32:51,992 --> 01:33:07,160
Speaker 0: also went to a Fred shot Q&A slightly before we had to do our panels And and I didn't get to it until it was close to over which was sad And a lot of the things he a lot of the answers to questions He was asked were things I had read online already and already knew But it was.

1468
01:33:07,261 --> 01:33:10,982
Speaker 0: it was quite excellent And it was very disappointing in that it was in the smallest panel room.

1469
01:33:11,263 --> 01:33:13,255
Speaker 0: that was in the healthiest Fred shot And it has.

1470
01:33:13,275 --> 01:33:14,488
Speaker 0: the room wasn't even half full.

1471
01:33:15,252 --> 01:33:16,488
Speaker 0: What the French shot?

1472
01:33:17,970 --> 01:33:19,756
Speaker 1: Muriyama Ishiguro all these people.

1473
01:33:20,198 --> 01:33:23,730
Speaker 1: we had ten times that many people in our panel, which is fucked up.

1474
01:33:23,870 --> 01:33:25,498
Speaker 0: Yeah, totally fucked up.

1475
01:33:25,659 --> 01:33:26,322
Speaker 0: We went to all.

1476
01:33:26,362 --> 01:33:31,283
Speaker 0: we went to panels with Muriyama Shot an Ishiguro, and they were amazing panels.

1477
01:33:31,343 --> 01:33:32,529
Speaker 0: we learned amazing things.

1478
01:33:35,133 --> 01:33:37,407
Speaker 1: Here's the recap in the 70s with Tezuka.

1479
01:33:37,569 --> 01:33:38,793
Speaker 0: yes Here's the recap.

1480
01:33:39,134 --> 01:33:53,366
Speaker 0: Fred shots amazing old-school pictures of him with Tezuka and other like old anime clubs from way back in the day Muriyama becoming an official member of the Otakon staff getting a t-shirt and bat and staff badge from

1481
01:33:53,426 --> 01:33:54,028
Speaker 1: very bad

1482
01:33:54,068 --> 01:34:02,748
Speaker 0: honorary badge Staff badge from Jim Valls and Ishiguro going on a big rant about.

1483
01:34:02,808 --> 01:34:10,328
Speaker 0: you know The Japanese government wasting money on an anime and manga museum when they should be spending the money to preserve old anime and manga Which are getting destroyed?

1484
01:34:10,890 --> 01:34:13,028
Speaker 0: Whereas you know he compared it to Disney in the u.s.

1485
01:34:13,410 --> 01:34:17,707
Speaker 0: Which keeps snow white in a giant tunnel so that it will you know be preserved forever.

1486
01:34:17,867 --> 01:34:22,663
Speaker 1: like one example Mushi to preserve Astro boy would have cost about three thousand dollars.

1487
01:34:22,763 --> 01:34:26,995
Speaker 0: digital digital preservation digital $3,000 an episode.

1488
01:34:27,216 --> 01:34:36,343
Speaker 0: they're spending like billions of yen to make this museum and create government jobs when they could be spending it to preserve Thousands of anime episodes and movies

1489
01:34:36,564 --> 01:34:40,090
Speaker 1: that well if we have time at the end We'll talk about those panels in more detail, but those panels are all great.

1490
01:34:40,090 --> 01:34:49,196
Speaker 0: Those are all awesome panels on Saturday and Sunday And if you go to a con and you're not going to the these kinds of panels What are you going for really?

1491
01:34:49,397 --> 01:34:50,481
Speaker 0: I mean it was just so sad.

1492
01:34:50,521 --> 01:34:53,090
Speaker 0: these are in small panel rooms, and they weren't really full.

1493
01:34:53,471 --> 01:34:54,256
Speaker 1: I mean Ishiguro.

1494
01:34:54,296 --> 01:34:56,730
Speaker 1: they ran out of questions to ask him in the audience.

1495
01:34:56,971 --> 01:35:01,330
Speaker 0: That's why he went on his rant, which I think was actually better than questions from the audience which sucked.

1496
01:35:01,471 --> 01:35:03,049
Speaker 1: Yeah, plus people always ask the same questions.

1497
01:35:07,152 --> 01:35:08,978
Speaker 0: There was a resurgence of L.O.G.H.

1498
01:35:09,038 --> 01:35:11,185
Speaker 0: fandom which all the questions asked of him were.

1499
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:11,947
Speaker 0: L.O.G.H.

1500
01:35:11,987 --> 01:35:12,389
Speaker 0: questions.

1501
01:35:14,254 --> 01:35:16,125
Speaker 0: Talk about the for tax reasons panel that we didn't.

1502
01:35:16,205 --> 01:35:16,990
Speaker 1: so I was gonna get to that.

1503
01:35:17,070 --> 01:35:20,058
Speaker 1: Yeah, but for tax reasons they did all like she.

1504
01:35:20,078 --> 01:35:23,267
Speaker 1: she she's a bombshell or I'm in your manger.

1505
01:35:23,588 --> 01:35:24,110
Speaker 1: all that stuff.

1506
01:35:24,431 --> 01:35:28,245
Speaker 1: Yep, the Pirates of Silicon Valley not Pirates of Silicon Valley.

1507
01:35:28,305 --> 01:35:32,317
Speaker 0: It's Community College DX whatever whatever it was called.

1508
01:35:32,357 --> 01:35:34,262
Speaker 1: something else though too wasn't there a subtitle?

1509
01:35:34,442 --> 01:35:35,585
Speaker 0: Pirates of something?

1510
01:35:36,066 --> 01:35:39,116
Speaker 0: Pirates of Dark Water College DX?

1511
01:35:39,136 --> 01:35:40,902
Speaker 1: yeah, but uh that you know.

1512
01:35:41,103 --> 01:35:42,588
Speaker 1: the guys who did venture brothers?

1513
01:35:42,949 --> 01:35:44,956
Speaker 1: no But they get.

1514
01:35:44,976 --> 01:35:49,061
Speaker 1: that was their whole shtick was that everyone thinks that the guys who do the venture brothers But they're not right.

1515
01:35:49,101 --> 01:35:50,089
Speaker 0: they have a similar style.

1516
01:35:50,572 --> 01:35:54,770
Speaker 1: But they gave actually an awesome panel even though half the panel is just showing the movies again.

1517
01:35:55,331 --> 01:36:02,334
Speaker 0: But even though I've seen the movie also showed there the final part which contains a robot fight pretty now available online Spoiled it.

1518
01:36:02,636 --> 01:36:06,154
Speaker 1: Oh, no in case they haven't seen it yet those guys are super cool And I want to.

1519
01:36:06,194 --> 01:36:08,230
Speaker 1: I want to interview them or do stuff with them in the future.

1520
01:36:08,250 --> 01:36:11,757
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean they're friends of Dave and Joel Well Dave Riley and they.

1521
01:36:12,059 --> 01:36:18,252
Speaker 0: Emily knows them because she went to school with them And we know them from this and there's a lot of connections going on there We need to take.

1522
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:22,730
Speaker 1: really I really want to get them hooked up at PAX East because I think they would go over really well.

1523
01:36:22,730 --> 01:36:24,443
Speaker 0: They would go over really well at PAX East.

1524
01:36:24,564 --> 01:36:25,390
Speaker 0: I agree plus.

1525
01:36:25,430 --> 01:36:34,108
Speaker 1: They're really funny in person like sometimes you have the situation where someone can do something cool like they have a webcomic Or something like that, but they're not really funny in person.

1526
01:36:34,148 --> 01:36:39,228
Speaker 0: these guys are Situation like Randall Monroe where he is really funny in person, but he's just really shy.

1527
01:36:39,248 --> 01:36:43,423
Speaker 1: yeah Yeah, but these guys are Dave and Joel style.

1528
01:36:43,483 --> 01:36:45,230
Speaker 1: funny on just in person.

1529
01:36:46,411 --> 01:36:48,360
Speaker 0: All right, so what else do you have to cover?

1530
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:50,650
Speaker 0: you want to talk about the closing ceremonies and the feedback?

1531
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:56,554
Speaker 1: We already sort of skip over a bunch of stuff and just kind of rush to the end here because we've gone on for a While.

1532
01:36:56,574 --> 01:36:57,661
Speaker 0: the thing is I don't think this really.

1533
01:36:57,681 --> 01:36:58,990
Speaker 0: I think we've sort of covered everything.

1534
01:36:59,111 --> 01:37:02,188
Speaker 0: I mean can you think of anything we didn't think a lot of interesting things to talk about?

1535
01:37:02,850 --> 01:37:10,328
Speaker 1: Like mostly it was things that came from the feedback Ceremony not the feedback ceremony the feedback session and the closing ceremonies.

1536
01:37:10,348 --> 01:37:15,110
Speaker 1: like one Closing ceremonies they they announced all the dates and everything for next year.

1537
01:37:15,191 --> 01:37:23,729
Speaker 1: They pushed the dates back a little bit And they showed the opening animation of Otakon again, which was again done by madhouse and which was again awesome.

1538
01:37:24,831 --> 01:37:27,200
Speaker 1: Jim Bowles was drawn as Java the Hut.

1539
01:37:27,963 --> 01:37:29,388
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, that's I remember that now.

1540
01:37:29,428 --> 01:37:32,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's good Yeah, and I'd say still like the I read the other one better.

1541
01:37:32,731 --> 01:37:40,862
Speaker 0: I think that by making it You know while it was sort of funny for us putting all those staff people into it because we knew who they were Right I mean that doesn't really.

1542
01:37:40,922 --> 01:37:42,530
Speaker 0: that's sort of like for the staff.

1543
01:37:42,610 --> 01:37:44,862
Speaker 0: I mean most of the con goers don't get it, and it's not.

1544
01:37:44,882 --> 01:37:46,270
Speaker 0: I don't think it's as enjoyable for the.

1545
01:37:47,071 --> 01:37:49,601
Speaker 1: It's cool because it's this inside anime.

1546
01:37:49,782 --> 01:37:50,464
Speaker 1: It is cool.

1547
01:37:50,565 --> 01:37:51,187
Speaker 0: I do like it.

1548
01:37:51,247 --> 01:37:53,196
Speaker 0: I Definitely keep doing it.

1549
01:37:53,236 --> 01:37:58,605
Speaker 1: It's definitely awesome, but you know you're missing the point cuz I think they're gonna do this every year from now on.

1550
01:37:58,928 --> 01:38:04,272
Speaker 0: oh yes But I think that making all the jokes like with these like the spaces of the staff Scott you're miss They're not.

1551
01:38:04,332 --> 01:38:07,510
Speaker 1: I don't think they're going to next year notice how the style was very different, too.

1552
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:13,790
Speaker 1: I think every year they're going to change it up a lot because I agree I Didn't say they're gonna do it next year.

1553
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:20,589
Speaker 0: I said that doing it this year sort of you know made it less enjoyable for many of the con goers who didn't get it.

1554
01:38:21,152 --> 01:38:24,365
Speaker 0: I'm saying is that I think like why does job without have an ugly face.

1555
01:38:24,586 --> 01:38:28,280
Speaker 0: I think doing it You don't realize it's a staff They don't know the staff thing.

1556
01:38:28,340 --> 01:38:32,497
Speaker 1: doing it that way was kind of this Omaze to fandom culture.

1557
01:38:32,537 --> 01:38:43,128
Speaker 1: because you look at fandom culture like anime con sci-fi cons like where these cons Really started in the 70s and that style of homage was like the thing to do.

1558
01:38:43,148 --> 01:38:44,555
Speaker 0: yes But including the.

1559
01:38:44,596 --> 01:38:46,770
Speaker 0: I'm saying that style of homage is definitely the thing to do.

1560
01:38:46,790 --> 01:38:57,403
Speaker 0: It's the same style you see in like the daikon animation including Star Wars including star right but including the staff is the part Including staff and in jokes like that was the style of the times.

1561
01:38:57,524 --> 01:38:57,744
Speaker 1: No.

1562
01:38:57,825 --> 01:39:08,390
Speaker 0: I've never seen that but anyway We've never been to like an old gaming con where they do yes regardless I think including the staff reduce the appeal of that particular opening animation for the con goer.

1563
01:39:08,671 --> 01:39:09,537
Speaker 1: So I think it was.

1564
01:39:09,638 --> 01:39:11,309
Speaker 0: I would have just you know, but it was still great.

1565
01:39:11,571 --> 01:39:18,687
Speaker 1: It was just a slight a slight complaint very tiny I don't I disagree and I think that putting it there was great because it makes that year really stand out.

1566
01:39:18,848 --> 01:39:20,172
Speaker 1: every year is going To stand out.

1567
01:39:20,233 --> 01:39:25,550
Speaker 1: I mean the first one stands out because it was the first one and because they had the exploding manhole covers.

1568
01:39:25,992 --> 01:39:31,541
Speaker 1: Yeah, this one will stand out because it was all the staff and next year is gonna stand out because it'll be like super flat Or something now.

1569
01:39:31,582 --> 01:39:41,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, maybe Yeah, you can definitely tell though that you know while the animation is great It is definitely the Madhouse B team.

1570
01:39:41,591 --> 01:39:45,975
Speaker 0: I mean if you look at what the Madhouse or at least they're not putting a team effort into it Even if it is the a-team.

1571
01:39:45,995 --> 01:40:01,025
Speaker 0: because you look at Madhouse a team animation and it's like whoa And you look at this and it looks it's great animation But it definitely looks like an anime from a few years back and they're not putting in you know the full You know full the kind of effort they would put into like a big movie.

1572
01:40:01,306 --> 01:40:05,533
Speaker 0: Well one funny thing Obviously, it's unreasonable to expect that I'm just pointing it out.

1573
01:40:05,654 --> 01:40:18,163
Speaker 1: one funny thing Mariana did point out in his panel because people kind of pointed out that Yeah, your shows kind of peter out or you know no sequels or anything like that, and he basically said yeah I kind of get bored halfway through any series.

1574
01:40:18,183 --> 01:40:19,228
Speaker 1: I just want to do something new.

1575
01:40:19,569 --> 01:40:24,710
Speaker 0: yeah He's like he always wants to do something new and he doesn't like doing sequels or repeats or extending something too long.

1576
01:40:24,771 --> 01:40:32,250
Speaker 0: And I think I think if you look at it You know Madhouse doesn't really do the long shows like the Dragon Balls or whatever and they don't do a lot of sequels either.

1577
01:40:32,391 --> 01:40:34,923
Speaker 0: So it's you know I think that's that's something to say.

1578
01:40:34,983 --> 01:40:36,490
Speaker 0: that's a big plus for Madhouse course.

1579
01:40:36,550 --> 01:40:45,381
Speaker 1: It was also interesting Madhouse's and their perspective because someone has you know there's that Trigon movie coming and someone actually asked It was like one of the few good questions at the con.

1580
01:40:45,904 --> 01:40:47,010
Speaker 1: You know why a Trigon movie?

1581
01:40:47,091 --> 01:40:53,089
Speaker 1: I thought it was very unpopular in Japan and it was okay popular in the US and the manga didn't really sell and all that sort of stuff.

1582
01:40:53,109 --> 01:41:00,470
Speaker 1: and His answer was basically that we're not releasing Trigon for a Japanese audience or an American audience.

1583
01:41:00,853 --> 01:41:03,150
Speaker 1: We're releasing it for the worldwide Trigon audience.

1584
01:41:03,290 --> 01:41:03,973
Speaker 1: It's a Western.

1585
01:41:04,053 --> 01:41:06,582
Speaker 1: Westerns aren't really popular in Japan because they're not.

1586
01:41:07,064 --> 01:41:08,650
Speaker 1: they're difficult for the Japanese.

1587
01:41:09,193 --> 01:41:10,941
Speaker 1: You know zeitgeist to wrap around there's.

1588
01:41:10,981 --> 01:41:12,770
Speaker 1: there isn't all the history and knowledge.

1589
01:41:13,494 --> 01:41:19,644
Speaker 0: And I think that's definitely the attitude that not just anime But all industries in the world need to start having.

1590
01:41:19,704 --> 01:41:23,014
Speaker 0: too many people are doing Targeted marketing.

1591
01:41:23,034 --> 01:41:27,750
Speaker 0: you know I mean even look at the way the advert the world of advertising is structured these days, right?

1592
01:41:27,830 --> 01:41:30,005
Speaker 0: Let's say we sold ads on geek nights.

1593
01:41:30,065 --> 01:41:30,347
Speaker 0: right.

1594
01:41:30,669 --> 01:41:34,702
Speaker 0: well I'd say a good large portion of our audience is outside the US right?

1595
01:41:35,203 --> 01:41:40,369
Speaker 0: let's say the US arm of some company They're advertising agent bought ads from us.

1596
01:41:40,852 --> 01:41:44,930
Speaker 0: They would only pay us for our US listeners even though they're getting the international listeners.

1597
01:41:45,392 --> 01:41:52,710
Speaker 0: It's just you know we're in a global world and too many companies They're still operating on a single country or regional mindset.

1598
01:41:52,830 --> 01:41:57,326
Speaker 0: And you really everything you do these days has to be operated on a completely global mindset.

1599
01:41:57,346 --> 01:42:00,856
Speaker 0: if you're making a video game To sell it to the whole world at once.

1600
01:42:00,917 --> 01:42:01,418
Speaker 0: immediately.

1601
01:42:01,879 --> 01:42:05,269
Speaker 0: your valve is figure this out, but Nintendo hasn't you know?

1602
01:42:05,810 --> 01:42:08,590
Speaker 1: But Mariama and madhouse have clearly figured clearly figured it out.

1603
01:42:08,590 --> 01:42:10,109
Speaker 0: I mean like the other and that's a good plus for them.

1604
01:42:10,230 --> 01:42:13,910
Speaker 1: We couldn't make it more palatable to a Japanese audience because then it wouldn't be Trigon anymore.

1605
01:42:13,970 --> 01:42:14,575
Speaker 1: So what's the point?

1606
01:42:14,696 --> 01:42:16,510
Speaker 0: and there is regardless of region?

1607
01:42:16,831 --> 01:42:21,330
Speaker 0: There is a big enough worldwide Trigon audience to support a Trigon movie about that.

1608
01:42:21,390 --> 01:42:28,377
Speaker 1: There is not a big enough Trigon audience in any one place But there is a big enough one in aggregate to where they can make this movie.

1609
01:42:28,417 --> 01:42:49,786
Speaker 1: that if they just made this like in Japan for Japanese people and there wasn't this worldwide audience or if they tried to like sell it only in Japan or try tried to you know Then package it and move it somewhere it would have failed or wouldn't have gotten done, but by taking this global perspective We're gonna get a Trigon movie And I'm really looking forward to that because I think Trigon is One of the better and more interesting anime out there partly because it's different

1610
01:42:49,866 --> 01:42:50,690
Speaker 0: even though the manga is bad.

1611
01:42:51,752 --> 01:42:53,316
Speaker 0: One incomprehensible gibberish.

1612
01:42:53,537 --> 01:42:58,070
Speaker 0: one interesting thing I did at the bandai entertainment panel, which is black and it was very unprofessional.

1613
01:42:58,251 --> 01:43:01,686
Speaker 0: I think it was actually sort of a bad panel because what anime industry is there?

1614
01:43:01,706 --> 01:43:02,369
Speaker 1: What's bandai gonna do?

1615
01:43:02,750 --> 01:43:05,124
Speaker 0: I know but there one thing I did learn at that panel.

1616
01:43:05,165 --> 01:43:05,949
Speaker 0: That was very good.

1617
01:43:06,291 --> 01:43:08,078
Speaker 0: Right is remember we saw sort of the stranger.

1618
01:43:08,700 --> 01:43:09,925
Speaker 0: bandai entertainment has that.

1619
01:43:09,965 --> 01:43:11,390
Speaker 0: that's their show their movie, right?

1620
01:43:11,450 --> 01:43:12,194
Speaker 0: And that's on DVD.

1621
01:43:12,235 --> 01:43:18,130
Speaker 0: I think now and they talked about how they showed it in theaters They're going to show the Eureka seven movie in theaters the same way.

1622
01:43:18,191 --> 01:43:23,065
Speaker 0: They showed sort of the stranger Which I think is very good and I look forward to them putting more things in theaters.

1623
01:43:23,085 --> 01:43:25,159
Speaker 0: and while I'm not sure if I like Eureka seven or not.

1624
01:43:25,180 --> 01:43:25,928
Speaker 0: I've never watched it.

1625
01:43:26,391 --> 01:43:31,030
Speaker 0: Apparently I asked around and the movie has is can be watched separate from the TV show.

1626
01:43:31,150 --> 01:43:33,338
Speaker 0: So when that's in the theaters, let's go.

1627
01:43:33,358 --> 01:43:34,362
Speaker 0: There you go.

1628
01:43:34,864 --> 01:43:35,767
Speaker 0: We'll go see it the same way.

1629
01:43:35,787 --> 01:43:43,655
Speaker 0: you saw sort of the stranger Yep And hopefully they will continue to put their movies in the theaters like that and we'll continue to go see them See all this cool stuff.

1630
01:43:43,876 --> 01:43:45,664
Speaker 1: and we got from these panels that no one goes to.

1631
01:43:45,885 --> 01:43:46,949
Speaker 1: these are the panels to go to.

1632
01:43:46,969 --> 01:43:48,337
Speaker 1: it's all The cool stuff happens.

1633
01:43:48,357 --> 01:43:48,819
Speaker 0: I know right.

1634
01:43:48,839 --> 01:43:49,463
Speaker 0: Where are you going?

1635
01:43:49,543 --> 01:44:05,847
Speaker 0: You're going to like that You're going to like that survived the zombie apocalypse panel every single year or that same lame shit Dungeons & Dragons when you could be going and listening to the director of Macross Legend of the Galactic Heroes and space battleship Yamato talk about.

1636
01:44:06,008 --> 01:44:11,205
Speaker 0: you know Like Japan and how they're wasting their money and such and such, you know, what's better?

1637
01:44:11,225 --> 01:44:12,650
Speaker 0: All right, where are your priorities?

1638
01:44:13,291 --> 01:44:16,930
Speaker 0: Yep, or I guess though if you're listening to this podcast, you're probably not making this mistake.

1639
01:44:17,492 --> 01:44:20,904
Speaker 1: Like how'd you mano you po was the last cell man animated show at Madhouse?

1640
01:44:21,145 --> 01:44:22,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's an interesting thing to learn.

1641
01:44:22,673 --> 01:44:23,288
Speaker 1: Yeah, there you go.

1642
01:44:23,390 --> 01:44:24,093
Speaker 1: One little thing.

1643
01:44:24,856 --> 01:44:28,510
Speaker 1: and that their biggest focus was to not make it look like it wasn't sell animated anymore.

1644
01:44:29,891 --> 01:44:30,795
Speaker 0: He talked about how.

1645
01:44:30,815 --> 01:44:33,404
Speaker 0: you know, the newer season was, you know, digitally animated.

1646
01:44:33,444 --> 01:44:39,346
Speaker 0: but like they're like look, you know The cell animated digital animated looks the same, you know, so they proved a point by doing that.

1647
01:44:39,406 --> 01:44:43,364
Speaker 0: but they you know It's just not economically feasible to do the cells anymore.

1648
01:44:43,384 --> 01:44:44,790
Speaker 0: Take it's just more honest.

1649
01:44:44,910 --> 01:44:45,833
Speaker 0: It's just a lot of work.

1650
01:44:46,134 --> 01:44:49,927
Speaker 0: That's sadly unnecessary, you know when you could do it with a computer.

1651
01:44:49,947 --> 01:44:52,286
Speaker 0: So That's that's it.

1652
01:44:52,791 --> 01:44:56,130
Speaker 1: Other Otacon was fantastic, but there are a bunch of interesting things.

1653
01:44:56,230 --> 01:45:02,190
Speaker 1: I want to note one the escalators worked for almost the entire con and that is crazy and amazing.

1654
01:45:02,491 --> 01:45:04,096
Speaker 1: Yep, for the first time like ever.

1655
01:45:04,297 --> 01:45:08,210
Speaker 0: Yep, very good - they're sort of lax in bad checking.

1656
01:45:08,310 --> 01:45:11,464
Speaker 0: Sometimes they would be very strict and they want to see the hologram.

1657
01:45:11,765 --> 01:45:12,970
Speaker 0: Sometimes they wouldn't check it all.

1658
01:45:13,031 --> 01:45:14,550
Speaker 0: I could walk in with like the badge in my pocket.

1659
01:45:14,852 --> 01:45:16,885
Speaker 1: You could just walk in without a badge most of the time.

1660
01:45:16,925 --> 01:45:17,590
Speaker 1: It was kind of sad.

1661
01:45:17,690 --> 01:45:21,493
Speaker 0: Yeah, they really need to step up the badge checking but Otacon This is the responsibility.

1662
01:45:21,513 --> 01:45:26,749
Speaker 0: the security hired security mostly and Otacon knows that the hired security basically sucks.

1663
01:45:28,031 --> 01:45:29,937
Speaker 0: Here's an example of the hired security sucking.

1664
01:45:29,957 --> 01:45:31,242
Speaker 0: I was in artists alley.

1665
01:45:31,543 --> 01:45:33,490
Speaker 0: The artists alley men's bathroom was out of order.

1666
01:45:33,773 --> 01:45:38,007
Speaker 0: There was a unisex bathroom though But of course it only has one toilet because it's mostly a handicapped bathroom.

1667
01:45:38,711 --> 01:45:47,678
Speaker 0: That bathroom was broken last year also so over entire year they didn't fix it right - there's a bathroom Right outside the exit to the artists alley.

1668
01:45:47,698 --> 01:45:47,878
Speaker 1: Yep.

1669
01:45:47,999 --> 01:45:48,741
Speaker 0: I went out.

1670
01:45:48,841 --> 01:45:51,510
Speaker 0: I just went immediately outside of the exits like literally.

1671
01:45:51,872 --> 01:45:53,599
Speaker 1: Like you can see I exited.

1672
01:45:53,619 --> 01:46:00,290
Speaker 0: the artists alley went into the out that bathroom That's immediately outside the exit and then I went to the security guy and he said it's exit only.

1673
01:46:00,411 --> 01:46:02,703
Speaker 0: I'm like, I know it's exit only but seriously.

1674
01:46:02,743 --> 01:46:03,910
Speaker 0: I just went in this bathroom.

1675
01:46:03,930 --> 01:46:05,681
Speaker 0: I'm like, I know it's exit only.

1676
01:46:05,721 --> 01:46:07,190
Speaker 0: there's not really a crowd here right now.

1677
01:46:07,310 --> 01:46:09,719
Speaker 0: Just let me in dude, and he wasn't mean.

1678
01:46:09,759 --> 01:46:15,060
Speaker 0: but he was like, sorry dude can't you know, he couldn't just be like Okay, go in, you know, he was a security guy.

1679
01:46:15,080 --> 01:46:17,030
Speaker 0: I think it was a blue or red shirt.

1680
01:46:17,070 --> 01:46:17,634
Speaker 0: I don't remember.

1681
01:46:17,654 --> 01:46:18,479
Speaker 1: It was a blue shirt.

1682
01:46:18,881 --> 01:46:22,449
Speaker 0: I think he might have been red anyway But you know, you just he wouldn't let me back in.

1683
01:46:22,530 --> 01:46:26,422
Speaker 0: I had to walk all the way around and I understand the traffic flow issue.

1684
01:46:26,442 --> 01:46:28,950
Speaker 0: that should be exit only I agree.

1685
01:46:29,552 --> 01:46:32,061
Speaker 0: But seriously, I just went to the bathroom.

1686
01:46:32,341 --> 01:46:34,850
Speaker 0: There wasn't a traffic flow situation at the moment.

1687
01:46:35,191 --> 01:46:39,869
Speaker 0: He could have just been like, okay, dude, go in right, but he wasn't cool and he wasn't improvising.

1688
01:46:40,210 --> 01:46:41,838
Speaker 1: There's nothing Otacon can do about that.

1689
01:46:42,421 --> 01:46:46,578
Speaker 0: No, but it's just you know, it's just the Security staff would have not had this problem.

1690
01:46:46,598 --> 01:46:49,350
Speaker 1: I don't think we'll ever get a quality security staff at Otacon.

1691
01:46:49,470 --> 01:46:50,253
Speaker 1: I think it's impossible.

1692
01:46:50,635 --> 01:46:51,980
Speaker 0: I think they just gonna have to pay.

1693
01:46:52,302 --> 01:46:53,647
Speaker 1: I think no, I think they do.

1694
01:46:53,767 --> 01:46:54,450
Speaker 1: I'll bet here.

1695
01:46:54,592 --> 01:46:55,790
Speaker 1: This is total speculation.

1696
01:46:55,850 --> 01:47:03,586
Speaker 1: I'll bet the BCC has a list of approved bonded Securities consultancies and they all suck and you have to use one of them and they also maybe this one.

1697
01:47:03,606 --> 01:47:06,578
Speaker 0: that does I think if there's One that doesn't suck and is very expensive.

1698
01:47:06,598 --> 01:47:07,482
Speaker 0: I think it might be worth it.

1699
01:47:07,824 --> 01:47:09,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I'll bet there isn't.

1700
01:47:09,411 --> 01:47:11,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know what the situation is there.

1701
01:47:11,110 --> 01:47:17,210
Speaker 0: All I know is that they have to explore any possibility whatsoever of getting a different or better security.

1702
01:47:17,250 --> 01:47:24,070
Speaker 0: There was apparently because they're obviously not gonna get these people to do a better job So the only way they can fix it is to take the money elsewhere if possible.

1703
01:47:24,231 --> 01:47:36,430
Speaker 1: There is apparently a situation where a bunch of people dressed up as straight-up SS like Gestapo soldiers Yep, and they had perfect cosplays of this and a small a small number of people to come were super offended.

1704
01:47:36,532 --> 01:47:37,630
Speaker 1: They raised a big stink in the forums.

1705
01:47:37,730 --> 01:47:44,168
Speaker 1: But it looks like Otacon is taking the correct policy of not going down the road of censoring cosplay.

1706
01:47:44,188 --> 01:47:49,406
Speaker 1: That doesn't violate Otherwise very clearly marked rules like don't be naked.

1707
01:47:49,466 --> 01:47:49,627
Speaker 0: Yes.

1708
01:47:49,687 --> 01:47:50,310
Speaker 0: I can understand it.

1709
01:47:50,310 --> 01:47:59,029
Speaker 0: The people were actually Nazis, you know if they were actually, you know KKK people if they're actually spreading hate or acting in a hateful manner at the convention.

1710
01:47:59,791 --> 01:48:01,970
Speaker 0: Immediately, you can just kick them out and no one's gonna complain.

1711
01:48:02,372 --> 01:48:09,220
Speaker 0: But if someone just happens to have a costume with swastikas on it or whatever, I mean I have to do megalopolis cosplay with swastikas.

1712
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:10,404
Speaker 0: I mean that's a legitimate hit.

1713
01:48:10,866 --> 01:48:14,213
Speaker 0: I mean, I'm a Jew Hitler.

1714
01:48:14,233 --> 01:48:16,021
Speaker 1: no Fukatsu is a Japanese video game.

1715
01:48:16,141 --> 01:48:17,829
Speaker 1: I can dress up like Master D if I want to.

1716
01:48:17,909 --> 01:48:32,350
Speaker 0: yes That is a legitimate cosplay and if you're not actually spreading hate or being hateful or anything like that or doing anything inappropriate a Cosplay that has a symbol on it isn't hurting anyone and it's perfectly appropriate.

1717
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:34,460
Speaker 0: Here's the thing, especially if it's a cosplay.

1718
01:48:34,480 --> 01:48:36,370
Speaker 0: don't anime manga video game, etc.

1719
01:48:36,852 --> 01:48:40,290
Speaker 1: I don't want to dwell on it because Otacon seems to have taken the right position and said, you know what?

1720
01:48:40,630 --> 01:48:42,078
Speaker 1: No, we're not gonna do anything about this.

1721
01:48:42,139 --> 01:48:42,601
Speaker 0: Very good.

1722
01:48:42,742 --> 01:48:43,124
Speaker 0: Very good.

1723
01:48:43,949 --> 01:48:47,059
Speaker 1: Ah There was the in so-called fortune.

1724
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:48,242
Speaker 1: Rick rolled the con.

1725
01:48:48,342 --> 01:48:49,846
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't think it was fortune.

1726
01:48:49,867 --> 01:48:51,070
Speaker 1: Well, but anyway, what do you mean?

1727
01:48:51,130 --> 01:48:51,933
Speaker 1: You don't think it was fortune.

1728
01:48:51,953 --> 01:48:52,114
Speaker 1: There's.

1729
01:48:52,134 --> 01:48:57,073
Speaker 1: no it wasn't the staff of fortune, but that doesn't mean that's not what people mean No one really knows.

1730
01:48:57,153 --> 01:49:02,290
Speaker 0: the point is is that there was a philosophy of bleach panel that was approved and scheduled, but it was based.

1731
01:49:02,390 --> 01:49:04,538
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, we can sum this up real quick.

1732
01:49:04,558 --> 01:49:05,903
Speaker 1: They don't want to dwell on it.

1733
01:49:06,405 --> 01:49:09,076
Speaker 1: quote the Otacon staff When it was brought up a con feedback.

1734
01:49:09,518 --> 01:49:12,069
Speaker 1: Yeah, we basically just got Rick rolled by.

1735
01:49:12,109 --> 01:49:23,290
Speaker 0: that They came and ran was supposed to be a philosophy of bleach panel But was actually they just dicked around and did stupid shit and gave out goodie bags that had like quote gay porn in them.

1736
01:49:23,431 --> 01:49:24,924
Speaker 0: And who knows what else happened there?

1737
01:49:25,005 --> 01:49:25,529
Speaker 0: I didn't go.

1738
01:49:25,952 --> 01:49:35,906
Speaker 0: I'm just repeating what I heard post-hoc and It was they closed the panel down as soon as they realized what was going on And that was a very appropriate closing the panel down.

1739
01:49:35,926 --> 01:49:36,570
Speaker 1: Here's the problem.

1740
01:49:37,314 --> 01:49:43,442
Speaker 1: I am fairly certain that after this year There's going to be a lot more of that next year at all the cons.

1741
01:49:43,724 --> 01:49:46,510
Speaker 1: and the only way around that is to have good people vetting out panels.

1742
01:49:46,650 --> 01:49:48,094
Speaker 0: But the thing is right.

1743
01:49:48,135 --> 01:49:52,286
Speaker 0: they can't actually vet the panels because they nobody at any con can.

1744
01:49:52,326 --> 01:50:00,050
Speaker 1: actually why there is one way To and it is to take a more proactive role and to solicit good stuff as opposed to just relying on fans submitting.

1745
01:50:00,090 --> 01:50:04,710
Speaker 0: Yes, they ought they have an open, you know, they have the industry submits their panels, but then they have an open submission.

1746
01:50:04,850 --> 01:50:06,956
Speaker 0: I think the cons really need to.

1747
01:50:06,996 --> 01:50:07,418
Speaker 0: you can't.

1748
01:50:07,598 --> 01:50:11,750
Speaker 0: obviously you're never gonna be able to look at the panels or screen them beforehand.

1749
01:50:11,750 --> 01:50:12,813
Speaker 0: You know, that's not gonna happen.

1750
01:50:12,833 --> 01:50:13,516
Speaker 0: That's impossible.

1751
01:50:13,536 --> 01:50:13,977
Speaker 0: I agree.

1752
01:50:14,539 --> 01:50:18,110
Speaker 0: What you can do is go and actively solicit panels.

1753
01:50:18,210 --> 01:50:29,020
Speaker 0: Go and say we want panel X. then go and look for someone out in the world who can run panel X. Say hey you we want you rim and Scott.

1754
01:50:29,060 --> 01:50:30,424
Speaker 0: We know that you're great at this.

1755
01:50:30,564 --> 01:50:32,530
Speaker 0: Please come and run this panel.

1756
01:50:33,672 --> 01:50:34,396
Speaker 1: Anime Boston.

1757
01:50:34,698 --> 01:50:35,362
Speaker 1: Um, right.

1758
01:50:35,604 --> 01:50:36,630
Speaker 1: They were like come to our con.

1759
01:50:37,330 --> 01:50:40,200
Speaker 0: Exactly instead of saying who wants to do panels.

1760
01:50:40,481 --> 01:50:42,126
Speaker 0: say we want you to do panels.

1761
01:50:42,166 --> 01:50:43,270
Speaker 0: We want you to do panels.

1762
01:50:43,330 --> 01:50:44,960
Speaker 0: We want you to do panels and even better.

1763
01:50:45,262 --> 01:50:46,710
Speaker 0: We want you to do this panel.

1764
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:58,110
Speaker 0: We want you to do this panel and that eliminates any possibility of rick-rolling or at least it greatly Decreases the chance of rick-rolling because you're not gonna get you know, no one's gonna be able to just submit their rick-roll panel.

1765
01:50:58,190 --> 01:51:02,830
Speaker 0: You're gonna go out and ask for panels from people and you know, you're gonna get to have a better.

1766
01:51:03,010 --> 01:51:13,210
Speaker 0: You know the condo have more control over the content that is at the con and it's just a better thing overall Even though it's more work, but it's not an impossible of matter of arc of work.

1767
01:51:13,572 --> 01:51:18,909
Speaker 0: It is an impossible amount of work to screen all the panels But it's not an impossible amount of work to solicit the panels.

1768
01:51:19,231 --> 01:51:25,938
Speaker 1: But we've dwelled on that forever and a few cons are taking us up on it But not every yep anime Boston solicited us.

1769
01:51:26,279 --> 01:51:27,603
Speaker 0: We had to solicit Otakon.

1770
01:51:27,643 --> 01:51:27,965
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1771
01:51:28,025 --> 01:51:28,446
Speaker 0: There you go.

1772
01:51:28,667 --> 01:51:29,510
Speaker 1: Kinetic on took whatever.

1773
01:51:31,513 --> 01:51:36,110
Speaker 0: They gave us a whole panel room and they said yes to whatever we put in the con feedback session.

1774
01:51:36,230 --> 01:51:38,357
Speaker 1: I actually and I'm gonna do a thing about this later.

1775
01:51:38,378 --> 01:51:45,022
Speaker 1: I noted every single question people asked and 90% of them were stupid questions.

1776
01:51:45,062 --> 01:51:45,828
Speaker 1: I'm sorry.

1777
01:51:46,029 --> 01:51:52,430
Speaker 0: Yes I have a. this is a feedback about the con feedback and it's actually also sort of a feedback about panels in general.

1778
01:51:52,470 --> 01:51:56,050
Speaker 0: Is that people don't know how to ask questions?

1779
01:51:56,470 --> 01:52:01,826
Speaker 0: They suck dick at asking questions and there needs to be some sort of question asking filter.

1780
01:52:01,886 --> 01:52:05,244
Speaker 0: Here are some possible question asking filters.

1781
01:52:05,325 --> 01:52:12,361
Speaker 0: number one Instead of people walking up to the microphone and asking questions Have them walk up to a staffer and ask them the question.

1782
01:52:12,382 --> 01:52:25,823
Speaker 1: the staff will write the question down on Paper and then well it when it's time for a new question Everyone walks up and first of all the staff will be like look Just be quick and you only get to have one feedback.

1783
01:52:26,205 --> 01:52:30,742
Speaker 1: and then for the first three quarters of the panel Every single person has like four feedbacks and they don't shut them up.

1784
01:52:31,143 --> 01:52:35,748
Speaker 1: if they let people use the microphone They need to literally just like cut people it's strange.

1785
01:52:36,411 --> 01:52:44,113
Speaker 0: I think they have no problem like being mean towards con goers outside, but at the feedback panel that to be super nice to them You know.

1786
01:52:44,153 --> 01:52:50,220
Speaker 0: and like it's like if that is the time to shut someone up like, you know They should have a but they should be able to turn the microphone.

1787
01:52:50,260 --> 01:52:54,750
Speaker 0: if you're gonna let people walk up to the mic at Least give someone the ability to turn it on and off.

1788
01:52:54,991 --> 01:52:58,470
Speaker 0: So turn it off as soon as the person has asked their first question and don't let them speak anymore.

1789
01:52:59,414 --> 01:53:06,041
Speaker 1: Is like my name is blah and I've been going to Otacon for X years and to this day No one has taken the Thunder out of those sales.

1790
01:53:06,302 --> 01:53:16,956
Speaker 1: You like my mix metaphor there you can say Better better than our friend Peter Olson who two or three years ago at the con Walked up and he was like, hi.

1791
01:53:16,977 --> 01:53:17,539
Speaker 1: My name is Pete.

1792
01:53:17,699 --> 01:53:18,242
Speaker 1: I've been going.

1793
01:53:18,262 --> 01:53:19,326
Speaker 1: This is my like 400th Otacon.

1794
01:53:19,386 --> 01:53:24,527
Speaker 0: and Yeah, I it's okay to say who you are and how many Otacons you've been to.

1795
01:53:24,547 --> 01:53:25,150
Speaker 0: that's okay.

1796
01:53:25,591 --> 01:53:29,303
Speaker 0: But then your question should be one or two sentences and that's it.

1797
01:53:29,744 --> 01:53:31,049
Speaker 0: I mean, but that's it.

1798
01:53:31,149 --> 01:53:31,470
Speaker 0: you're done.

1799
01:53:31,691 --> 01:53:41,090
Speaker 0: You shouldn't be sitting up there like explaining explaining and explaining and explaining, you know If you want to do that make a podcast like we do or you can spend two hours explaining.

1800
01:53:41,190 --> 01:53:43,784
Speaker 1: There's the thing it used to be that the problem with feedback was.

1801
01:53:43,804 --> 01:53:48,070
Speaker 1: that is a million cosplay things I think because Otacon runs the masquerade in the arena.

1802
01:53:49,012 --> 01:53:51,984
Speaker 1: There was almost nothing about the masquerade in this.

1803
01:53:52,084 --> 01:53:57,585
Speaker 0: so it was very strange because I mean Usually you expect a ton of masquerade feedback to the point at which we would suggest doing that.

1804
01:53:57,645 --> 01:54:06,750
Speaker 0: anime Boston doesn't separating masquerade feedback and regular feedback, but actually You know Otacon had barely any masquerade feedbacks.

1805
01:54:07,330 --> 01:54:16,152
Speaker 0: Most of the feedbacks were related to you know, things like Daryl Surratt's panel getting shut down the 4chan panel Oh my god, pretty bad security Etc.

1806
01:54:16,232 --> 01:54:16,735
Speaker 0: Etc.

1807
01:54:16,755 --> 01:54:19,008
Speaker 1: We've already meant you some of the entire panel.

1808
01:54:20,172 --> 01:54:26,790
Speaker 1: The most asked question was I'm stupid and I either didn't read the book or have a really ludicrous idea that Otacon could never do?

1809
01:54:27,311 --> 01:54:32,190
Speaker 1: Yep, the second most common thing was you shut down the best panel at the con.

1810
01:54:32,431 --> 01:54:34,196
Speaker 1: Seriously, Daryl Surratt's panel.

1811
01:54:34,377 --> 01:54:36,945
Speaker 1: Yep, and number three mail out the badges.

1812
01:54:37,026 --> 01:54:37,668
Speaker 1: Oh my god.

1813
01:54:37,989 --> 01:54:44,868
Speaker 0: Yep Yeah, they really need to rework the feedback panel Maybe even a not having it at all.

1814
01:54:45,391 --> 01:54:52,116
Speaker 0: Because even having the feedback panel has you know has these various suggestions that go well You know, it suggests certain things.

1815
01:54:52,337 --> 01:54:53,683
Speaker 0: Pax doesn't have a feedback panel.

1816
01:54:54,406 --> 01:54:55,410
Speaker 0: What why is there feedback?

1817
01:54:56,211 --> 01:54:57,916
Speaker 0: Why should you come and why should there be?

1818
01:54:58,217 --> 01:55:02,050
Speaker 0: why should our panel close with on this negative note of everyone fucking complaining?

1819
01:55:02,590 --> 01:55:04,037
Speaker 0: You know, why should you even be allowed to complain?

1820
01:55:04,057 --> 01:55:06,870
Speaker 0: if you want to complain send us an email or come to the forum later.

1821
01:55:07,191 --> 01:55:08,778
Speaker 0: The con is not the time to complain.

1822
01:55:08,958 --> 01:55:10,484
Speaker 1: Well, here's one thing though.

1823
01:55:10,906 --> 01:55:11,870
Speaker 0: There's an argument to be had.

1824
01:55:12,232 --> 01:55:13,297
Speaker 1: Enjoy the feedback.

1825
01:55:13,418 --> 01:55:15,589
Speaker 0: I enjoy it too, but I'm just saying there's an argument to be made.

1826
01:55:16,091 --> 01:55:18,439
Speaker 1: But it's really simple to fix the feedback panel.

1827
01:55:18,961 --> 01:55:24,312
Speaker 1: one only let people give one feedback and they make them go to the end of the line to Before.

1828
01:55:24,372 --> 01:55:30,636
Speaker 1: if the first 15 minutes go through all the things that you know people are gonna ask and you're already aware of

1829
01:55:30,857 --> 01:55:38,009
Speaker 0: and just answer them off the bat and say if you ask any about any of The things we just said you're gonna sit down and you're not gonna ask

1830
01:55:39,517 --> 01:55:39,999
Speaker 1: Like people.

1831
01:55:40,180 --> 01:55:41,809
Speaker 1: every year people ask the same like ten.

1832
01:55:41,829 --> 01:55:43,950
Speaker 0: yes It's like we sit down for the feedback panel.

1833
01:55:44,071 --> 01:55:46,649
Speaker 0: We already know what the big think topics are gonna be.

1834
01:55:47,052 --> 01:55:51,215
Speaker 0: So if they would just address that if they know what they are - they know that you know This panel was shut down.

1835
01:55:51,255 --> 01:55:52,120
Speaker 0: That was a big deal.

1836
01:55:52,140 --> 01:55:53,206
Speaker 0: This is a big deal.

1837
01:55:53,246 --> 01:55:53,909
Speaker 0: That was a big deal.

1838
01:55:54,291 --> 01:56:00,908
Speaker 0: Just address the big deals right away and then say if you have a question about anything else I mean seriously come up.

1839
01:56:01,532 --> 01:56:04,746
Speaker 1: There's the person who was like why don't you get a panel about X every year?

1840
01:56:04,766 --> 01:56:07,449
Speaker 1: account staff is like well We can only get panels if people submit him.

1841
01:56:08,523 --> 01:56:09,890
Speaker 1: If you want to do the panel, that'd be great.

1842
01:56:10,713 --> 01:56:14,410
Speaker 1: And then every year they say the exact same thing because someone asks the exact same question.

1843
01:56:14,751 --> 01:56:18,566
Speaker 0: Yep, it's like someone always gonna understand if you were not there the in previous years.

1844
01:56:18,606 --> 01:56:21,900
Speaker 0: if it's your first Oticon It could understand if it's your first feedback panel.

1845
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:29,607
Speaker 0: I can understand if you came into the feedback panel late Regardless that stuff because there's a like a thousand people in that room who aren't you?

1846
01:56:29,988 --> 01:56:31,860
Speaker 0: so Send an email later.

1847
01:56:32,989 --> 01:56:34,216
Speaker 1: Ah We should just cut this short.

1848
01:56:34,397 --> 01:56:35,404
Speaker 0: I think I think we're done.

1849
01:56:35,444 --> 01:56:36,450
Speaker 0: We talked about the feedback panel.

1850
01:56:36,490 --> 01:56:37,679
Speaker 0: I'm sure this stuff we missed.

1851
01:56:38,021 --> 01:56:39,209
Speaker 0: we covered as much as we could.

1852
01:56:39,651 --> 01:56:40,656
Speaker 0: Episode is gonna be long.

1853
01:56:40,696 --> 01:56:42,283
Speaker 0: It needs to be long to sum it all up.

1854
01:56:42,484 --> 01:56:43,749
Speaker 0: Otakon is great Otakon.

1855
01:56:44,091 --> 01:56:46,223
Speaker 1: This was like my favorite Otakon in a long time.

1856
01:56:46,243 --> 01:56:47,390
Speaker 1: It was super awesome.

1857
01:56:47,490 --> 01:56:51,806
Speaker 0: I've been to seven Otakons is definitely in the top three four three or four.

1858
01:56:51,906 --> 01:56:54,710
Speaker 0: It might be the fourth best awesome people.

1859
01:56:55,371 --> 01:56:57,889
Speaker 1: Everything was great except the few complaints we had.

1860
01:56:58,371 --> 01:57:03,030
Speaker 1: However, if I have to stand in a three-hour reg line, I might not go back as much as I love Otakon.

1861
01:57:03,392 --> 01:57:05,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, they gotta mail the badges.

1862
01:57:05,185 --> 01:57:09,841
Speaker 1: no excuses Whatever it takes mail those badges because Otakon is like if it means.

1863
01:57:09,981 --> 01:57:15,828
Speaker 0: even if it means like one less Japanese musical guest if it Means, you know, I don't care if I have to pay like 20 more.

1864
01:57:16,512 --> 01:57:19,690
Speaker 1: I would pay like 20 or 30 bucks just to not have to stand in line.

1865
01:57:19,891 --> 01:57:27,690
Speaker 0: In fact, you know making Otakon more expensive while it even might reduce attendance which Otakon I think they just really don't want to do anything that will reduce attendance.

1866
01:57:27,791 --> 01:57:29,169
Speaker 0: Like they're really obsessed with the numbers.

1867
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:34,870
Speaker 0: I think it would actually make the con a better con if I raise the price and also advertise.

1868
01:57:35,051 --> 01:57:39,269
Speaker 1: I think if Otakon advertised they could get 10,000 more people, but I don't know if they could handle that.

1869
01:57:39,602 --> 01:57:52,289
Speaker 0: No but I think if they raise the price of the badge and Use that money to a mail the badges and market that I think it would balance out because with that extra money They would be able to mail the badges and handle more people.

1870
01:57:53,213 --> 01:57:53,835
Speaker 0: So there you have it.

1871
01:57:54,056 --> 01:57:58,170
Speaker 1: So Otakon 2009 super awesome, and I'm going to bed.

1872
01:57:58,470 --> 01:57:59,432
