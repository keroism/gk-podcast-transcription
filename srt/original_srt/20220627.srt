1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:09,939
Speaker 0: It's Monday, June 27th, 2022.

2
00:00:09,939 --> 00:00:10,160
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:13,197 --> 00:00:13,649
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:15,055
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:15,075 --> 00:00:18,210
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about refrigeration technology.

6
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,428
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

7
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:24,006
Speaker 0: And finally, we are free.

8
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:25,634
Speaker 0: Hockey is over.

9
00:00:25,815 --> 00:00:27,866
Speaker 0: I don't have to think about, "Oh, when's the next hockey

10
00:00:27,886 --> 00:00:28,369
Speaker 0: game?"

11
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,310
Speaker 0: Until, uh... For a little while.

12
00:00:31,993 --> 00:00:32,460
Speaker 1: Four months?

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,149
Speaker 1: Three or four months?

14
00:00:33,615 --> 00:00:33,828
Speaker 0: Yup.

15
00:00:34,412 --> 00:00:38,470
Speaker 0: And all I'll say is, you know what, I was rooting for the Avalanche because, one, they were gonna win anyway.

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,379
Speaker 0: Like, that path was determined.

17
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:42,470
Speaker 0: Round one showed me the way.

18
00:00:43,792 --> 00:00:47,170
Speaker 1: I mean, I thought they were gonna win since early in the regular season.

19
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,950
Speaker 1: But, on the other hand, it's like, you know, none of these, either team, neither one was a team that I hated or had bad people on it.

20
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:56,550
Speaker 1: You know, that I was aware of or anything.

21
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:06,350
Speaker 0: Though, what's funny is, right around this time, you see that ESPN has that big documentary about, basically, the hockey era of my childhood, the Red Wings-Avalanche rivalry.

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:09,309
Speaker 1: Yeah, 'cause they've went against each other several years.

23
00:01:09,770 --> 00:01:10,432
Speaker 0: Exactly.

24
00:01:10,452 --> 00:01:12,278
Speaker 0: But it's no longer a rivalry.

25
00:01:12,298 --> 00:01:13,663
Speaker 0: Like, the teams don't give a shit about each other.

26
00:01:13,743 --> 00:01:15,830
Speaker 0: Like, the hockey's very different now, but...

27
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:18,150
Speaker 1: Well, divisions change and all sorts of stuff, right?

28
00:01:20,252 --> 00:01:24,065
Speaker 0: But, I'm very happy that the Rangers made it as far as the conference finals.

29
00:01:24,566 --> 00:01:25,550
Speaker 0: Nothing to cry about.

30
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:28,089
Speaker 1: They did not think we were gonna make it there.

31
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:29,291
Speaker 0: Yep.

32
00:01:29,311 --> 00:01:35,449
Speaker 0: And now, this is one of those teams, Rangers have got a few years of "stay this good and just keep trying for a

33
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:35,630
Speaker 0: cup.".

34
00:01:35,731 --> 00:01:37,425
Speaker 0: And maybe it'll happen, maybe it won't, but...

35
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:45,010
Speaker 1: The problem is, is like, the Rangers are quite good, you know, but you look at these teams, like the Avalanche specifically, right?

36
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:49,539
Speaker 1: And it's like, you could just see, they're so far ahead of the other teams.

37
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:55,570
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, if the average team is a strength of five, right?

38
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,769
Speaker 1: The Rangers might have a strength of seven and a half or eight.

39
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:05,383
Speaker 1: And there's a lot of teams with a similar strength of seven and a half, eight, nine, right?

40
00:02:05,743 --> 00:02:08,710
Speaker 1: But the Avalanche have a strength of like, eleven or twelve.

41
00:02:09,431 --> 00:02:10,627
Speaker 0: Well, I think, so I read a bunch...

42
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:12,665
Speaker 1: And nobody else is like, you know, up there.

43
00:02:12,725 --> 00:02:13,169
Speaker 1: It's like, well...

44
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,384
Speaker 0: I read a bunch of analysis of people trying to say like, what's the deal?

45
00:02:16,404 --> 00:02:17,570
Speaker 0: Like, what exactly is happening?

46
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,910
Speaker 0: And there actually are pretty common themes, even among a bunch of people who normally disagree with each other.

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:30,330
Speaker 0: But they seem to come down to more depth in the team, like better coordination among the lines, like really just basic stuff.

48
00:02:30,691 --> 00:02:38,690
Speaker 0: But also, everyone made the point that they are proof that you do not need a good goalie to be a good NHL team.

49
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,229
Speaker 1: Well, you have to have an okay goalie.

50
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:44,270
Speaker 0: Oh no, but I saw people pointing out that people making an argument that they didn't even need a good goalie.

51
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,709
Speaker 0: Their goalie didn't even actually have to deal with that many shots.

52
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,137
Speaker 1: I mean, yeah, that's definitely part of it, right?

53
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:53,890
Speaker 1: You know, but he did, he was slightly subpar, right?

54
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,710
Speaker 1: I think he let in like a few over expected, but it's not like he was awful or terrible or anything.

55
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:04,430
Speaker 1: If you had a terrible goalie, so many more, you know, he did make saves, they would have gone in if you had a terrible goalie, right?

56
00:03:04,691 --> 00:03:09,489
Speaker 0: But look, Vasilevski and Shasturkin, two of the best goalies in the game right now.

57
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:18,130
Speaker 0: And yet, I think we have discovered, as we talked about before when we were in for this matchup, we were about to see the immovable object versus the unstoppable force.

58
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,230
Speaker 0: Turns out an unstoppable force will beat an immovable object every time in hockey.

59
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:28,310
Speaker 1: Right, because even the greatest goalie, they're not a superhuman who can just stop every single shot no matter how ridiculous, right?

60
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:37,190
Speaker 1: So therefore, it's, you know, it's like if you have the best goalie in the universe, but the rest of your team isn't good enough, the other team is going to get a million shots.

61
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:42,564
Speaker 1: And even though only 0.05% of them go in, it's like they just make enough shots.

62
00:03:42,825 --> 00:03:44,770
Speaker 1: and they make good enough ones, they're going to go in.

63
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:50,407
Speaker 1: And if your team can't get into the offensive zone, you can't score goals and the other team could just beat you 1-0.

64
00:03:50,507 --> 00:03:51,310
Speaker 1: It could happen.

65
00:03:51,511 --> 00:03:57,370
Speaker 0: Yeah, I did see one argument though that Colorado has the extra X factor of their high elevation team.

66
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:13,350
Speaker 1: So I think that's, I think there's some, you know, it's not completely without merit, but I think it is nonsense because if that was the case, we would see Colorado teams in all athletic sports winning more often on average.

67
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:19,543
Speaker 0: Not necessarily because that type of, like, the equivalent of doping, it's basically natural doping.

68
00:04:19,603 --> 00:04:22,250
Speaker 0: Doping meaning putting extra red blood cells in, essentially.

69
00:04:23,230 --> 00:04:29,570
Speaker 0: That only primarily benefits you in extreme endurance sports, but not in, like, other kinds of explosive action sports.

70
00:04:31,810 --> 00:04:40,010
Speaker 0: The point, we don't see people who come from higher elevations doing better on average in, like, foot races and many types of track and field events.

71
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:46,130
Speaker 1: The best track and field people are all from, like, you know, Nigeria.

72
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:55,390
Speaker 0: Yeah, but statistically, of course, there are individuals who can overcome anything like that, but overall, high elevation training is effective at certain kinds of sports.

73
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,519
Speaker 0: But anyway, hockey's done.

74
00:04:57,539 --> 00:04:58,766
Speaker 0: Don't have to worry about hockey anymore.

75
00:04:58,786 --> 00:04:59,470
Speaker 0: I heard you got a plant.

76
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:03,534
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, so I had, you know, I had a lot of house plants, right?

77
00:05:03,674 --> 00:05:15,249
Speaker 1: But the thing with the house plants is that, you know, it's hard to, if you just, you know, buy plants and it's, like, at a random place, you know, just say, "Oh, that plant looks nice.

78
00:05:15,309 --> 00:05:15,650
Speaker 1: I'll buy

79
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:15,750
Speaker 1: it.".

80
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:19,890
Speaker 1: You don't know, A, what kind of plant it is specifically, how to take care of it.

81
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:24,210
Speaker 0: Maybe at best it's got that little card that gives you vague instructions that assume you know a lot.

82
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:32,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, and then it's, like, if you don't have, you know, a garage or a yard, it's, like, it's hard to take care of plants just in a pot in an apartment.

83
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:33,813
Speaker 1: It's, like, what are you going to do?

84
00:05:33,833 --> 00:05:34,557
Speaker 1: You buy a bag of dirt?

85
00:05:34,577 --> 00:05:36,385
Speaker 1: Where are you going to put a bag of dirt in an apartment?

86
00:05:36,425 --> 00:05:38,592
Speaker 1: You don't have a, it's, like, We have a container.

87
00:05:38,612 --> 00:05:39,835
Speaker 0: Remember the old Geek Nights container?

88
00:05:39,855 --> 00:05:46,230
Speaker 0: That is currently on the balcony, and in that container is the bag of dirt and a bunch of other stuff like that.

89
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:48,750
Speaker 1: You have not wasted my balcony space on bag of dirt.

90
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:52,350
Speaker 0: Our balcony's huge, so it doesn't really take up any material about a space.

91
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:58,084
Speaker 1: The point is, is that it's a pain in the ass to do things like repotting plants or whatever.

92
00:05:58,104 --> 00:06:00,770
Speaker 1: You know, there's nowhere to go to do that, right?

93
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:14,350
Speaker 1: So, uh, one of the things I planned to do during my time of not work, which has got a couple more weeks left, uh, was go take care of the houseplants because they're all alive, but some of them were falling over because they were too big for the pot.

94
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:24,610
Speaker 1: Some of them were alive but sad, you know, so I took them to this plant store, and the plant store was basically the ideal retail establishment, right?

95
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:29,489
Speaker 1: So, you know, we always talk about just buy shit online, it's cheaper, right, you know?

96
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:37,030
Speaker 0: Well, what we always say, we always said, unless you need to talk to an expert and the store you're going to will have an expert.

97
00:06:37,110 --> 00:06:44,730
Speaker 1: Right, retail stores usually don't have experts, don't have good selection, don't have good prices, don't offer anything, right?

98
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:56,510
Speaker 1: But this particular plant store, I go in, and I, you know, I went up to the counter where, you know, this woman was sitting, and I, you know, but she, you know, didn't seem like she wanted to help me.

99
00:06:56,730 --> 00:07:04,490
Speaker 1: She seemed like she was, right, like working and cashiering and that sort of thing, and like she didn't want a customer service very much.

100
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:12,770
Speaker 1: And it turns out this other person in the store, this broey dude, who I didn't, who I just thought was a customer, was actually the owner.

101
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:30,650
Speaker 1: And he was, you know, it's like you look at this guy, and if you had seen this dude in any other setting, the street, you know, the park, anywhere, you'd think he was just some broey dude who was, you know, gonna get drunk, party, drive a fart car, right?

102
00:07:30,852 --> 00:07:31,507
Speaker 0: And he might be.

103
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:33,972
Speaker 1: Right, in New York too.

104
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:42,010
Speaker 1: But this dude was the owner of a plant store and an enormous plant nerd, like plant nerd the way that we're a computer nerd, right?

105
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:44,234
Speaker 1: And he was so happy, right?

106
00:07:44,294 --> 00:07:52,990
Speaker 1: It's like what he was doing would have normally counted as mansplaining, if not the fact that I was specifically asking for the explanation.

107
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:54,974
Speaker 0: It's funny, we had the same experience recently.

108
00:07:54,994 --> 00:07:58,841
Speaker 0: There's a little plant store that has a lot of succulents near us, like by the huntress.

109
00:07:59,222 --> 00:08:01,988
Speaker 0: Same deal, the people in there know everything.

110
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,150
Speaker 0: They're like mega plant nerds.

111
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:09,580
Speaker 1: Right, this dude is a huge plant nerd, you know, and he repotted my plants, and he's like, "Oh, you gotta get some fertilizer for this

112
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:09,940
Speaker 1: one.".

113
00:08:10,001 --> 00:08:11,022
Speaker 1: And he's like, "You should get this

114
00:08:11,082 --> 00:08:11,503
Speaker 1: kind.".

115
00:08:11,563 --> 00:08:12,385
Speaker 1: And I'm like, "Do you sell

116
00:08:12,405 --> 00:08:12,565
Speaker 1: that?".

117
00:08:12,585 --> 00:08:15,149
Speaker 1: And he's like, "No, I don't sell

118
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:15,350
Speaker 1: that.".

119
00:08:15,671 --> 00:08:20,630
Speaker 0: That's the surest sign of a real expert in a store, if they will recommend things that they don't even sell.

120
00:08:21,431 --> 00:08:27,246
Speaker 1: And I was like, "Yeah, this plant came with this kind of dirt, but I had to switch it to this kind of dirt because I couldn't find the kind of dirt it came

121
00:08:27,286 --> 00:08:27,447
Speaker 1: with.".

122
00:08:27,487 --> 00:08:28,449
Speaker 1: And he's like, "I make my own

123
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:28,630
Speaker 1: dirt.".

124
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:42,370
Speaker 1: Alright, but he repotted my plants, and I bought a new plant there, and I got some newer pots, and now my houseplant situation is all very nice now.

125
00:08:42,929 --> 00:08:49,650
Speaker 0: I think there's something to this ongoing belief and assumption and pop culture idea that millennials are obsessed with plants.

126
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:56,580
Speaker 1: Houseplant popularity is actually way up, which is probably why stores like that are successful.

127
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,506
Speaker 1: People got plants in their houses, you know.

128
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:01,470
Speaker 1: They want more, you know.

129
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,756
Speaker 1: People want plants when they had offices.

130
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:08,990
Speaker 1: You know, every office I've ever worked in, people are always having plants at the desk, right?

131
00:09:10,953 --> 00:09:12,562
Speaker 0: I wonder if we're allowed to have plants that are desks.

132
00:09:12,582 --> 00:09:13,970
Speaker 0: I've never seen one at anyone's desk.

133
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:15,277
Speaker 1: Really, never?

134
00:09:15,378 --> 00:09:16,529
Speaker 1: I've never not seen one.

135
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:19,170
Speaker 0: I mean, our desks are tiny at work.

136
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:28,166
Speaker 1: I guess my past three jobs, which is going back, you know, a long time because I kept the jobs for a long time each, but that's like 15 years' worth.

137
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:30,030
Speaker 1: People always had plants.

138
00:09:31,811 --> 00:09:33,684
Speaker 0: The only thing on my desk is one little goomba.

139
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:37,556
Speaker 1: The only thing on my desk now is nothing.

140
00:09:37,616 --> 00:09:39,341
Speaker 1: I don't have an office desk anymore.

141
00:09:39,361 --> 00:09:39,863
Speaker 1: I just have this.

142
00:09:39,943 --> 00:09:40,846
Speaker 1: This is my only desk.

143
00:09:40,866 --> 00:09:42,070
Speaker 1: I got one.

144
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,031
Speaker 0: Get in the news.

145
00:09:43,272 --> 00:09:45,495
Speaker 0: One non-tech news, but we can't not talk about it.

146
00:09:45,655 --> 00:09:48,719
Speaker 0: Of course, go read Real News to find out more.

147
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:56,050
Speaker 0: If you're hearing about this from Geek Nights, once again, I don't know what to say except go read something.

148
00:09:56,090 --> 00:09:58,185
Speaker 1: Maybe they're from another country or something.

149
00:09:58,205 --> 00:09:58,910
Speaker 1: You know, I don't know.

150
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,939
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're in the US and you're hearing about this from us, shame on you.

151
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:09,068
Speaker 0: But if you're outside the US, this has grave portents for other countries, too.

152
00:10:09,128 --> 00:10:10,270
Speaker 0: This is a big problem.

153
00:10:10,711 --> 00:10:23,130
Speaker 0: Basically, of course, the US Supreme Court has been compromised because the traitor guy who took over our government in an illegitimate election in 2016 cheated and appointed a bunch of people to our court.

154
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:28,920
Speaker 0: If you're not familiar with the American courts, basically our Supreme Court is invincible.

155
00:10:29,341 --> 00:10:34,190
Speaker 0: The people on it are appointed for life and there is zero accountability and supreme power.

156
00:10:35,232 --> 00:10:38,730
Speaker 0: And we're kind of screwed right now because there's no way to kick someone off the Supreme Court.

157
00:10:39,093 --> 00:10:41,350
Speaker 1: You can impeach them, but it's basically impossible.

158
00:10:41,490 --> 00:10:50,185
Speaker 0: It requires a supermajority in our Senate, which is 50% controlled by the fascists and unable to be changed significantly for reasons.

159
00:10:50,285 --> 00:10:55,650
Speaker 1: So we're in deep shit and they've basically- At least if you agree to follow the rules that are written in the Constitution.

160
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,945
Speaker 0: Yeah, which that would be a coup.

161
00:10:59,307 --> 00:11:00,496
Speaker 1: I'm not saying- Which we're still doing.

162
00:11:00,658 --> 00:11:02,050
Speaker 1: We're still doing for now, right?

163
00:11:02,551 --> 00:11:03,413
Speaker 0: To a degree.

164
00:11:03,473 --> 00:11:11,670
Speaker 0: The Department of Justice and the military effectively said that they're going to ignore state laws and make sure that service members can get whatever health care they need, which is a start.

165
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,329
Speaker 1: But if it's on federal land, then there's nothing they could do.

166
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:25,930
Speaker 0: But basically what this means is about half of the American states either have now or will imminently ban basically all abortions.

167
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:31,570
Speaker 0: And the other half of America's states are enshrining the right to abortions in their own constitutions.

168
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:38,190
Speaker 0: And the Republican Party in our country has said pretty much straight up that if they take back the government, they're going to ban it nationally.

169
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,657
Speaker 0: They're going to pass a law that just bans it in all 50 states.

170
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:47,450
Speaker 1: So the only way- Oh, but we could just filibuster that forever the same as they do.

171
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:48,392
Speaker 0: Nope.

172
00:11:48,533 --> 00:11:54,630
Speaker 0: If they pass it, they could overturn the filibuster because you only need 51 votes to overturn the filibuster and change the rules.

173
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,918
Speaker 0: Well, we don't have 51 votes.

174
00:11:56,938 --> 00:11:59,908
Speaker 0: We have 48 Democratic senators and two traitors.

175
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:11,821
Speaker 0: So basically the only legal thing you can do if you're not down for a coup, other than protesting and harm mitigation, is effectively in the

176
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:12,202
Speaker 0: U.S.,

177
00:12:12,262 --> 00:12:18,229
Speaker 0: we got to pick up at least one net seat in the Senate in the 2022 election.

178
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:25,930
Speaker 0: Because a lot of people on the left who are screaming and freaking out are also kind of yelling at the wrong people in one specific regard.

179
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:34,590
Speaker 0: Our Senate voted in May to overturn the filibuster and enshrine a basic form of abortion rights nationally, which would undermine this rule.

180
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:38,198
Speaker 0: That bill went down 49 to 51.

181
00:12:38,198 --> 00:12:40,584
Speaker 0: One piece of shit.

182
00:12:40,604 --> 00:12:42,689
Speaker 0: Democratic senator, Joe Manchin, voted against it.

183
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:50,910
Speaker 0: Meaning if we pick up even one seat, we should be able to do the exact same vote and it would get through the filibuster on a technicality.

184
00:12:52,931 --> 00:12:54,415
Speaker 0: So that's what we can do.

185
00:12:54,576 --> 00:12:58,387
Speaker 0: And the most likely one is Pennsylvania, where the cool guy is running.

186
00:12:58,869 --> 00:12:59,270
Speaker 0: Betterment.

187
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:09,130
Speaker 1: But even if we do that, you know, we have to keep that because at any moment, if the other side takes over the government, they could just pass the opposite law.

188
00:13:09,431 --> 00:13:09,651
Speaker 0: Yep.

189
00:13:09,712 --> 00:13:15,370
Speaker 0: Well, once we get that, the other next step is we got to either pack the court or abolish the Supreme Court or do something.

190
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,637
Speaker 0: We got to do something egregious, which is possible.

191
00:13:19,018 --> 00:13:20,863
Speaker 0: Packing the court is something FDR threatened to do.

192
00:13:21,304 --> 00:13:23,850
Speaker 0: It's doable, but it requires getting rid of the filibuster.

193
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:26,090
Speaker 1: FDR was not a perfect individual.

194
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,210
Speaker 0: Not saying he was, but in that regard...

195
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:31,400
Speaker 1: He had guts to tell you.

196
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,730
Speaker 1: this is what I want to happen and he made it happen, right?

197
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:34,131
Speaker 1: Yep.

198
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:35,735
Speaker 0: So we'll see.

199
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:41,210
Speaker 0: At least one more Democrat has to be in the Senate for anything to happen.

200
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:48,490
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, it's just, you know, the same crisis that's been happening for a long time continues to happen.

201
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,290
Speaker 0: Yep.

202
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:58,590
Speaker 0: The American population is concentrated into a handful of states and the rest of the empty land gets overrepresented in our government because our Constitution is...

203
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:01,408
Speaker 1: It's been this way since before we were born and we're still alive and...

204
00:14:02,491 --> 00:14:04,716
Speaker 0: Our Constitution is old and crufty.

205
00:14:04,956 --> 00:14:09,264
Speaker 0: And if you notice, we haven't amended it in a long time, except for trivial stuff.

206
00:14:09,525 --> 00:14:12,070
Speaker 0: It's starting to run out of steam, that thing.

207
00:14:13,792 --> 00:14:14,590
Speaker 1: Oh, what are we going to do?

208
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:15,992
Speaker 0: We'll see.

209
00:14:16,393 --> 00:14:21,970
Speaker 0: So I encourage you to read more about this and look at what options you have for doing something about it.

210
00:14:22,271 --> 00:14:24,339
Speaker 0: And if you're against abortion, I don't know what to get.

211
00:14:24,580 --> 00:14:25,584
Speaker 0: Stop listening to geek nights.

212
00:14:26,106 --> 00:14:27,010
Speaker 0: Like, what are you even doing here?

213
00:14:29,431 --> 00:14:37,209
Speaker 0: So in other news that is not that, you know, Geek Nights Monday technology, Google is actually both of our newses.

214
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:41,710
Speaker 0: Google is shutting down hangouts, which I feel like they have announced...

215
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:42,254
Speaker 1: That's not news.

216
00:14:42,295 --> 00:14:44,110
Speaker 1: We knew this was announced a long time ago.

217
00:14:44,270 --> 00:14:48,249
Speaker 0: I feel like this has been announced at least half a dozen times in some form.

218
00:14:49,772 --> 00:14:52,450
Speaker 1: They keep, you know, changing their fucking minds over there.

219
00:14:52,570 --> 00:14:57,050
Speaker 1: You know, it's like it's bad enough to start things and then, you know, get users and then turn them off.

220
00:14:57,150 --> 00:15:04,350
Speaker 1: It's another thing to like, you know, not just turn something off, but to like transition to other products and change branding.

221
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:12,650
Speaker 1: And because now not only are you hurting people by turning off a thing that they've come to depend on, but you're now also confusing people, right?

222
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:18,421
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, having allo and duo and chat and we are we are.

223
00:15:18,481 --> 00:15:23,430
Speaker 0: we are terminally online technologists who have been doing a podcast for like 15 years on technology.

224
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:29,910
Speaker 0: And yet I have to go look up what the fuck Google is doing and what app does what in this ecosystem.

225
00:15:30,251 --> 00:15:30,451
Speaker 1: Right.

226
00:15:30,491 --> 00:15:53,010
Speaker 1: It seems like they're finally getting everything in order and that I don't know what the time frame on this is, but when all is said and done, they are going to have all of the text chatting consolidated into Google Chat, which will be a product that is somewhere in between like a Slack and a, you know, Hangout DM thing.

227
00:15:53,151 --> 00:15:55,070
Speaker 1: But no one's really going to use it, basically.

228
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:58,530
Speaker 0: I mean, I don't even use Hangouts or any of this anymore.

229
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:04,750
Speaker 1: We used to use it, but then, you know, I stopped using it years ago when they basically fucked it up.

230
00:16:04,971 --> 00:16:06,244
Speaker 1: And then that was it.

231
00:16:06,973 --> 00:16:07,869
Speaker 0: I moved everything into Discord.

232
00:16:07,950 --> 00:16:08,972
Speaker 1: I don't know anyone who.

233
00:16:09,152 --> 00:16:20,870
Speaker 1: the only time I've seen it used recently is that, you know, if you were from working at companies, the companies I've worked for recently have used, you know, the Google Chat.

234
00:16:21,211 --> 00:16:22,355
Speaker 1: Right.

235
00:16:23,197 --> 00:16:26,929
Speaker 1: You know, as sort of like the backup if Slack goes down.

236
00:16:29,991 --> 00:16:38,010
Speaker 1: So even if the companies have Google, you know, workspaces, you know, for their email, it's like they're only using that for email.

237
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:40,870
Speaker 1: They're not using that for chatting on a regular basis.

238
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:41,830
Speaker 1: They have Slack, right?

239
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,250
Speaker 1: My ring light is having a problem with USB cable.

240
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:47,782
Speaker 1: USB cable is flaky.

241
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:55,570
Speaker 0: Basically, when Google Hangouts started like breaking and all the problems happened, that's basically when I jumped ship to Discord.

242
00:16:55,790 --> 00:17:02,410
Speaker 0: Today, I'd say that 80 percent of the people who want to talk to me just DM me on Discord or talk to me in a Discord.

243
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,510
Speaker 0: Another like 10 percent still SMS me.

244
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:10,490
Speaker 0: A handful of people, including my mom, Twitter DM me and everything else is email.

245
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:11,138
Speaker 0: And that's it.

246
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,869
Speaker 1: I mean, that's this is a sort of a fundamental thing.

247
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:18,530
Speaker 0: I guess I roll SMS and signal together because they work the same way.

248
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:20,909
Speaker 0: Like it doesn't matter which one's which when someone messages me.

249
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:27,849
Speaker 1: The point is, is that any service in which requires any platform in which users make accounts.

250
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:28,591
Speaker 1: Right.

251
00:17:29,694 --> 00:17:36,810
Speaker 1: It becomes basically trivial for that service to add a feature which allows users to direct message each other.

252
00:17:37,351 --> 00:17:43,429
Speaker 1: And even if that service is not a messaging service, that is, you know, where that is the primary use of it.

253
00:17:44,011 --> 00:17:44,312
Speaker 1: Right.

254
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:48,469
Speaker 1: It becomes also a necessary and helpful feature.

255
00:17:48,649 --> 00:17:48,810
Speaker 1: Right.

256
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,620
Speaker 1: So let's say you have, I don't know, eBay.

257
00:17:51,283 --> 00:17:51,485
Speaker 1: Right.

258
00:17:53,092 --> 00:17:55,488
Speaker 1: eBay's primary feature is buying and selling shit.

259
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:55,710
Speaker 1: Right.

260
00:17:55,870 --> 00:18:08,610
Speaker 1: But if you're going to have a transaction with someone, it becomes useful and necessary to have some sort of way to message that person and come and converse with a person that you were having a transaction.

261
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:08,832
Speaker 1: Yep.

262
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:09,478
Speaker 0: Like Uber.

263
00:18:09,983 --> 00:18:10,710
Speaker 0: All the problems with Uber.

264
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:14,990
Speaker 0: None of us said you got to be able to chat with the person who's picking you up in case like, wait, what intersection are you at?

265
00:18:15,410 --> 00:18:16,159
Speaker 0: You know, confusion.

266
00:18:16,645 --> 00:18:16,807
Speaker 0: Airbnb.

267
00:18:18,610 --> 00:18:28,570
Speaker 0: Like there are good reasons for this in terms of if you have a conversation through the Airbnb platform, then the company has a record of that in case there's fraud or malfeasance.

268
00:18:28,992 --> 00:18:30,590
Speaker 0: There's a lot of reasons why this makes sense.

269
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:36,510
Speaker 0: But now to your point, I have all these like messaging systems that each have a very specific purpose.

270
00:18:38,511 --> 00:18:38,691
Speaker 1: Yeah.

271
00:18:38,931 --> 00:18:39,752
Speaker 1: I mean, you know, it's like.

272
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:51,870
Speaker 1: so what happens is there's all these DM platforms everywhere and people will just start using one and the platforms that used to exist that whose sole purpose was text messaging.

273
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:52,512
Speaker 1: Right.

274
00:18:52,592 --> 00:18:59,590
Speaker 1: Other than SMS, all the other ones have really kind of bitten it right in favor of things that are also something else.

275
00:18:59,730 --> 00:18:59,871
Speaker 1: Right.

276
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:06,130
Speaker 1: You know, even your even your WhatsApp apps and things of that nature, it's like they're also sort of like a group chat thing.

277
00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:07,052
Speaker 1: And they all right.

278
00:19:07,133 --> 00:19:08,978
Speaker 1: Or, you know, it's like.

279
00:19:09,058 --> 00:19:13,050
Speaker 1: Facebook is also Facebook Messenger and Instagram as DMS.

280
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:19,890
Speaker 1: And even though it was primarily a photo thing originally, at least, you know, it's like so those end up getting all the users.

281
00:19:20,631 --> 00:19:25,549
Speaker 1: And then, you know, things like Google Hangout is right falling over.

282
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:27,313
Speaker 0: So, yep.

283
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:35,470
Speaker 0: So along those lines, even in more news, Google is combining duo, which I guess somehow still existed.

284
00:19:36,312 --> 00:19:38,238
Speaker 0: I remember I installed duo.

285
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,730
Speaker 0: It didn't work with domains at the time.

286
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:42,758
Speaker 0: So I never.

287
00:19:42,899 --> 00:19:44,209
Speaker 0: I never used it even once.

288
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,658
Speaker 1: I mean, that was the last time they tried to do this.

289
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:51,389
Speaker 1: They made that aloe in the duo and were like, OK, I forgot about aloe.

290
00:19:52,334 --> 00:19:52,596
Speaker 1: Right.

291
00:19:52,798 --> 00:19:53,890
Speaker 1: It lasted five minutes.

292
00:19:54,232 --> 00:19:56,590
Speaker 0: You know, whatever they launch them at like the same time.

293
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:57,192
Speaker 0: And I did.

294
00:19:57,212 --> 00:20:01,610
Speaker 1: That was the idea is that that was the original attempt was to replace hang out with aloe and duo.

295
00:20:02,431 --> 00:20:08,530
Speaker 1: And now they're basically they're going to have chat and they're going to have meat, which already meat is the only thing that Google has.

296
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:18,270
Speaker 1: I think that's going to actually have sustained usage because any company that even a company that uses Google workspaces and pays for it is going to be using Slack or Microsoft Teams or something.

297
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:19,845
Speaker 1: They're not going to be using the Google chat.

298
00:20:19,946 --> 00:20:20,128
Speaker 1: Right.

299
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:26,630
Speaker 1: But the Google meet companies use that except for companies that might pay extra and use Zoom instead.

300
00:20:27,432 --> 00:20:28,458
Speaker 1: Right.

301
00:20:29,182 --> 00:20:30,490
Speaker 1: The actual the best ones.

302
00:20:31,271 --> 00:20:31,492
Speaker 1: Right.

303
00:20:31,592 --> 00:20:38,310
Speaker 1: Still, to this day, I still believe that I message and especially FaceTime are the best as a product.

304
00:20:38,851 --> 00:20:46,490
Speaker 1: But they only work if everyone has an Apple device and therefore they're never going to be a solution for pretty much anyone.

305
00:20:46,772 --> 00:20:48,630
Speaker 0: I used I only recently got an Apple device.

306
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:53,190
Speaker 0: And even today, the vast majority of people I interact with online do not have even one Apple device.

307
00:20:53,871 --> 00:20:58,010
Speaker 1: But even if they do have an Apple device, it's like as soon as you have one person who doesn't.

308
00:20:58,110 --> 00:20:58,270
Speaker 1: Right.

309
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:06,290
Speaker 1: So it's like maybe the only people you talk to in your life are your family and they all have Apple devices, in which case it's going to be fantastic for you.

310
00:21:06,573 --> 00:21:06,797
Speaker 1: Right.

311
00:21:06,918 --> 00:21:07,750
Speaker 1: It's going to be amazing.

312
00:21:08,252 --> 00:21:14,410
Speaker 1: Maybe every single friend you have, you're a high school student and all of your friends have iPhones, literally everybody.

313
00:21:14,571 --> 00:21:17,008
Speaker 1: And you don't have a single person who doesn't have one.

314
00:21:17,069 --> 00:21:17,230
Speaker 1: Right.

315
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:19,843
Speaker 1: It's going to be fantastic for you to use iMessage and FaceTime.

316
00:21:20,225 --> 00:21:21,130
Speaker 1: Life is going to be great.

317
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:21,551
Speaker 1: Right.

318
00:21:21,992 --> 00:21:27,990
Speaker 1: But if you have just if you have online friends, if you're a connected person or if you're if you have friends in the community.

319
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:28,411
Speaker 1: Right.

320
00:21:28,431 --> 00:21:42,270
Speaker 1: You go to say, I don't know, a club or a volunteer group or a religious organization or a city council community or any kind of social group that you interact with.

321
00:21:42,492 --> 00:21:42,714
Speaker 1: Right.

322
00:21:43,219 --> 00:21:44,190
Speaker 1: A bowling league.

323
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:44,852
Speaker 1: Right.

324
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:51,389
Speaker 1: There's going to be at some point along the way, there's going to be people who are not using it.

325
00:21:51,730 --> 00:21:52,031
Speaker 1: Right.

326
00:21:52,592 --> 00:22:00,310
Speaker 1: And it ends up being that the universal platforms that work, no matter what computer or device someone has.

327
00:22:01,151 --> 00:22:01,455
Speaker 1: Right.

328
00:22:01,475 --> 00:22:02,730
Speaker 1: Even if they're shittier.

329
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:03,392
Speaker 1: Right.

330
00:22:03,412 --> 00:22:04,248
Speaker 1: Zoom is shittier.

331
00:22:04,812 --> 00:22:05,034
Speaker 1: Right.

332
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,710
Speaker 1: And FaceTime, it's going to win.

333
00:22:08,131 --> 00:22:08,333
Speaker 1: Right.

334
00:22:08,413 --> 00:22:11,170
Speaker 1: And so Google Meet is really good.

335
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:18,130
Speaker 1: If you have a company and everyone's using Google Workspaces, everyone can use Google Meet and it works for in company stuff.

336
00:22:18,411 --> 00:22:24,610
Speaker 1: But as soon as you have to interact with another company at that company is not using Google Workspaces also.

337
00:22:24,830 --> 00:22:25,252
Speaker 1: Guess what?

338
00:22:25,312 --> 00:22:29,770
Speaker 1: Now your company is also going to use Zoom to interact with the other companies.

339
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,610
Speaker 0: I haven't at least found that Zoom has displaced almost everything else.

340
00:22:32,650 --> 00:22:35,269
Speaker 0: And I find that every professional interaction I have is Zoom now.

341
00:22:36,051 --> 00:22:36,231
Speaker 1: Right.

342
00:22:36,272 --> 00:22:41,330
Speaker 1: And then your company is going to be like, well, we have to interact with people outside the company and use Zoom.

343
00:22:41,911 --> 00:22:45,970
Speaker 1: Then why the fuck are we going to use Google Meet for internal and Zoom for external?

344
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:47,441
Speaker 1: Let's just use Zoom for everything.

345
00:22:47,461 --> 00:22:48,630
Speaker 1: That way we're using less things.

346
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,750
Speaker 1: And then you're not using Google Meet anymore.

347
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:51,226
Speaker 0: Yeah.

348
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:56,209
Speaker 1: So I think that's the fundamental thing Google has to do.

349
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:57,489
Speaker 0: The sad thing, though, is...

350
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:58,788
Speaker 1: It's products out there.

351
00:22:59,672 --> 00:23:02,950
Speaker 1: I think it's sort of lost because, like, you know, it's like this.

352
00:23:03,932 --> 00:23:06,149
Speaker 1: Are people even using Gmail anymore?

353
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:07,247
Speaker 1: Like who need email?

354
00:23:07,530 --> 00:23:08,550
Speaker 0: Well, because no one sends emails.

355
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:14,530
Speaker 0: I increasingly find that and not from an old person complaining if you should use email for everything, that's ridiculous.

356
00:23:14,711 --> 00:23:19,149
Speaker 0: But email is good if you want to send someone like a whole ass page of text.

357
00:23:20,030 --> 00:23:25,786
Speaker 0: And I have people who will like SMS me a long thread.

358
00:23:25,846 --> 00:23:27,310
Speaker 0: that could have just been one email.

359
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:28,471
Speaker 1: Sure.

360
00:23:28,531 --> 00:23:33,851
Speaker 1: But I'm saying it's like, you know, if there are people who are new... You know, we have Gmail because... Right.

361
00:23:34,354 --> 00:23:37,350
Speaker 1: Like if I had to start using email today, I wouldn't choose Gmail.

362
00:23:38,176 --> 00:23:38,319
Speaker 1: Right.

363
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:38,830
Speaker 1: Not a chance.

364
00:23:39,110 --> 00:23:42,910
Speaker 1: The reason I use Gmail is because back in the day I had college email.

365
00:23:43,371 --> 00:23:43,592
Speaker 1: Right.

366
00:23:43,652 --> 00:23:50,050
Speaker 1: And at the time, everyone using the email their ISP gave them, whether that was the college or whatever, AOL or, you know, something.

367
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:54,250
Speaker 1: And then we entered the next period where it's like you weren't dependent.

368
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:56,409
Speaker 1: Your ISP could no longer give you services.

369
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:56,911
Speaker 1: Right.

370
00:23:56,952 --> 00:24:02,470
Speaker 1: Because they couldn't compete with the services like the ones that were provided by, you know, web apps.

371
00:24:02,971 --> 00:24:03,173
Speaker 1: Right.

372
00:24:03,555 --> 00:24:05,830
Speaker 1: So people moved to Gmail.

373
00:24:06,271 --> 00:24:06,512
Speaker 1: Right.

374
00:24:07,175 --> 00:24:10,470
Speaker 1: But now it's like, you know, at the time, Gmail was the only one.

375
00:24:10,634 --> 00:24:11,189
Speaker 1: That was the game.

376
00:24:11,290 --> 00:24:16,950
Speaker 0: I would probably still use Gmail today because I'm thinking about all the alternatives and I would probably just get a Gmail account.

377
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:24,110
Speaker 1: I would use maybe the iCloud email or there's some other ones out there that are that are good options also.

378
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:25,222
Speaker 0: Not a ton though.

379
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,470
Speaker 0: You start scraping the bottom of the barrel pretty quick.

380
00:24:31,295 --> 00:24:39,070
Speaker 1: If I only had to choose between Microsoft, Google, Apple, I guess Facebook doesn't give out email.

381
00:24:39,991 --> 00:24:43,706
Speaker 0: In that situation, I guess I might go with Microsoft.

382
00:24:43,746 --> 00:24:44,790
Speaker 0: if I didn't go with Gmail.

383
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:46,694
Speaker 1: I would choose the Apple one.

384
00:24:46,795 --> 00:24:51,150
Speaker 1: Of those three choices, I would choose the Apple with if I didn't have any existing anything.

385
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,489
Speaker 1: The Apple one is the easy choice for sure.

386
00:24:54,091 --> 00:24:55,890
Speaker 0: Of course, I didn't have an iPhone until recently.

387
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,429
Speaker 1: I'm just you know, even if I had no devices at all.

388
00:24:59,891 --> 00:25:00,152
Speaker 1: Right.

389
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:03,762
Speaker 1: Just choosing only the email app and not any.

390
00:25:03,983 --> 00:25:06,290
Speaker 1: nothing else is set yet with the Apple one.

391
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,566
Speaker 0: But I got to say, good lord.

392
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:24,970
Speaker 0: Now that not that Covid is winding down, but as I've interacted with humans again a little more frequently, I am reminded that outside of my close circles, if you ask someone how you can get in touch with them, I have found that a lot of people don't actually have a good answer anymore.

393
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:32,610
Speaker 0: Like non-online people aren't really sure and they'll mumble something about Facebook or maybe they have a cell phone number.

394
00:25:32,710 --> 00:25:34,184
Speaker 0: They'll give you a text and that's about it.

395
00:25:35,731 --> 00:25:38,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, because like they're really only, you know, communicating frequently.

396
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:43,710
Speaker 1: You know, they don't have an online presence where they're communicating with lots of people.

397
00:25:44,271 --> 00:25:45,177
Speaker 1: It's like they only.

398
00:25:45,237 --> 00:25:47,390
Speaker 1: it's like how did they communicate with their family?

399
00:25:48,191 --> 00:25:51,570
Speaker 1: Maybe they are one of those Apple only families that all FaceTimes each other.

400
00:25:51,730 --> 00:25:52,990
Speaker 1: But it's like, how do I get in touch with you?

401
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:54,689
Speaker 1: Well, they're not going to give you their fucking FaceTime.

402
00:25:56,291 --> 00:25:57,177
Speaker 1: That's not how it's going to.

403
00:25:57,197 --> 00:25:57,861
Speaker 1: you're not going to.

404
00:25:57,881 --> 00:25:59,210
Speaker 1: you just have to send them a quick message.

405
00:26:00,273 --> 00:26:03,530
Speaker 1: They don't have a personal email that they're checking right constantly.

406
00:26:03,692 --> 00:26:05,030
Speaker 1: They're not an online person.

407
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:08,670
Speaker 0: I mean, I give people my direct Discord, but a lot of people don't.

408
00:26:09,311 --> 00:26:11,409
Speaker 0: Discord is terrifying and confusing to them.

409
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're not going to make and they have to make an account for it.

410
00:26:15,131 --> 00:26:18,910
Speaker 1: Which they're not going to do just to talk to one person.

411
00:26:20,090 --> 00:26:21,637
Speaker 0: I would advise everyone.

412
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:24,690
Speaker 0: as a total aside and related to the first news we talked about.

413
00:26:25,511 --> 00:26:29,210
Speaker 0: I would suggest installing Signal and just setting it up even if you don't use it.

414
00:26:29,450 --> 00:26:29,926
Speaker 0: Signal is...

415
00:26:30,111 --> 00:26:30,515
Speaker 1: I have it.

416
00:26:30,656 --> 00:26:31,910
Speaker 1: I have it set up and never use it.

417
00:26:32,051 --> 00:26:34,289
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you set it up and never use it, it will.

418
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:39,410
Speaker 0: If you message someone else who has Signal, then you'll have end to end encryption.

419
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:41,389
Speaker 0: Like it's it's legit and it works.

420
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:44,029
Speaker 0: And that might be useful depending on how things go.

421
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:45,660
Speaker 1: I don't think that.

422
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:46,670
Speaker 1: I don't think that works like that.

423
00:26:46,710 --> 00:26:49,609
Speaker 1: If you just use the iPhone messages app, it's not just going to be like...

424
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,389
Speaker 0: I use the Signal app.

425
00:26:51,412 --> 00:26:53,269
Speaker 1: Yeah, I use the iPhone messages app.

426
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:55,089
Speaker 0: No, you got to use the Signal app or it doesn't do shit.

427
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:56,238
Speaker 1: Yeah.

428
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:57,977
Speaker 1: Well, that's that's that's not.

429
00:26:58,038 --> 00:26:59,929
Speaker 1: and, you know, I installed it and I don't use it.

430
00:27:00,332 --> 00:27:02,530
Speaker 0: No, see, I installed it and I actually do use it.

431
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:02,973
Speaker 0: I use it.

432
00:27:03,215 --> 00:27:04,488
Speaker 0: I replaced SMS with it.

433
00:27:05,892 --> 00:27:07,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, iMessages is also end to end encrypted.

434
00:27:13,870 --> 00:27:16,270
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

435
00:27:16,390 --> 00:27:20,930
Speaker 0: So I'm linked to a tweet because the tweet links to a video, but the tweet also gives some context.

436
00:27:21,534 --> 00:27:22,669
Speaker 0: The video is in German.

437
00:27:23,571 --> 00:27:24,509
Speaker 0: It won't matter that much.

438
00:27:25,113 --> 00:27:27,130
Speaker 0: It doesn't actually matter what they're saying.

439
00:27:27,191 --> 00:27:29,350
Speaker 0: It looks like there's subtitles in multiple languages.

440
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:39,490
Speaker 0: But my thing of the day is a video where there is a 15th century bath house in Germany and it has been restored.

441
00:27:40,796 --> 00:27:42,249
Speaker 1: So a late medieval bath house.

442
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:47,050
Speaker 0: Yeah, it has been restored and renovated to be fully functional and period correct.

443
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,410
Speaker 0: And it's a museum.

444
00:27:49,830 --> 00:27:54,910
Speaker 0: And this video is two naked German guys taking you through the full experience.

445
00:27:55,790 --> 00:28:02,410
Speaker 0: And I got to tell you, bath houses are something super cool that I wish Americans respected more.

446
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:06,387
Speaker 0: And I wish we had destroyed all of them at the end of the 20s and 30s.

447
00:28:09,291 --> 00:28:09,573
Speaker 1: All right.

448
00:28:09,593 --> 00:28:13,850
Speaker 1: So I think we've done an episode on sound cards a long time ago, but for people who aren't aware.

449
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:14,711
Speaker 1: Right.

450
00:28:14,731 --> 00:28:18,049
Speaker 1: You know, computers originally all the only sound they had was beep beep.

451
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:18,531
Speaker 1: Right.

452
00:28:18,692 --> 00:28:22,490
Speaker 1: And then, you know, the motherboard didn't have any sound audio facilities on it.

453
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:27,470
Speaker 1: You had to put a card in your computer that had synthesizers and other sorts of audio chips on it.

454
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,260
Speaker 0: You probably got an ad lib card.

455
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,970
Speaker 0: Maybe you got a sound blaster.

456
00:28:31,630 --> 00:28:32,733
Speaker 1: And so, you know, right.

457
00:28:32,773 --> 00:28:40,070
Speaker 1: So some, you know, when it comes to playing record, fully recorded audio samples like MP3s, WAV files, anything like that.

458
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:47,890
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter what sound card it is because you have the exact wave that is going to be played is recorded and then played.

459
00:28:48,010 --> 00:29:05,430
Speaker 1: But the earliest computers and consoles could not do that because the amount of memory it would take to store a high fidelity audio sample of any length before we invented MP3s and processors fast enough to decompress them quickly, you know, was vast.

460
00:29:05,591 --> 00:29:08,162
Speaker 1: And you didn't have a lot of storage space in early computers.

461
00:29:08,222 --> 00:29:09,910
Speaker 1: And so that didn't work out.

462
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:30,130
Speaker 1: So what you do is put a synthesizer in your computer and then it took a very little space to just basically have the equivalent of digital sheet music or even just, you know, a program that would generate, you know, sheet music effectively in, you know, as it processed to instruct the synthesizer.

463
00:29:30,250 --> 00:29:33,399
Speaker 1: Basically, it's like a keyboard without any keys.

464
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,169
Speaker 1: And there's a processor that pushes the keys electronically.

465
00:29:37,771 --> 00:29:38,473
Speaker 1: Right.

466
00:29:39,014 --> 00:29:43,909
Speaker 1: And because of that, every computer and every sound card sounded differently.

467
00:29:44,049 --> 00:29:44,250
Speaker 1: Right.

468
00:29:44,530 --> 00:29:46,257
Speaker 1: The Commodore 64 sounded great.

469
00:29:46,699 --> 00:29:49,149
Speaker 1: You know, some old Apple computers could really just go.

470
00:29:51,653 --> 00:30:06,670
Speaker 1: You know, but there are people with nostalgia and there are people with preservation interests and people with, you know, various reasons would want to have, you know, those exact or as close enough to it.

471
00:30:07,151 --> 00:30:15,350
Speaker 1: The exact synthesizers that were in those old sound cards so that they could, you know, use old software and hear exactly what it sounded like back in the day.

472
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:18,215
Speaker 1: Create music that is retro.

473
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:22,623
Speaker 1: So many reasons that you would want an old sound card and old sound cards.

474
00:30:23,043 --> 00:30:25,047
Speaker 1: Not necessarily easy to acquire.

475
00:30:25,107 --> 00:30:26,650
Speaker 1: There just might not be a lot of them.

476
00:30:26,930 --> 00:30:28,434
Speaker 1: They might not be a lot of them that work.

477
00:30:28,814 --> 00:30:29,075
Speaker 1: Right.

478
00:30:29,416 --> 00:30:29,957
Speaker 1: They might not.

479
00:30:30,077 --> 00:30:35,550
Speaker 1: Even if you buy a Sound Blaster 16 and you find one that inbox mint inbox.

480
00:30:35,730 --> 00:30:36,172
Speaker 1: Guess what?

481
00:30:36,533 --> 00:30:40,950
Speaker 1: That shits an ISA card and your computer does not have an ISA slot.

482
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:43,129
Speaker 0: Your computer doesn't even have a PCI slot.

483
00:30:43,951 --> 00:30:44,171
Speaker 1: Right.

484
00:30:44,212 --> 00:30:45,153
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

485
00:30:45,273 --> 00:30:48,058
Speaker 1: So it's like, well, how are you going to hook that up to your computer?

486
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:54,889
Speaker 1: You probably could find a way, some sort of adapter, some and write a bunch of drivers or get an old computer also.

487
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:55,690
Speaker 1: But that sucks.

488
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:06,807
Speaker 1: So here we have somebody who in 2019 compiled this forum post, the comprehensive list of all modern reproductions of vintage sound cards.

489
00:31:07,388 --> 00:31:08,570
Speaker 1: And it's exactly what it is.

490
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:12,497
Speaker 1: It's a comprehensive list of modern reproductions of classic sound cards.

491
00:31:13,178 --> 00:31:16,344
Speaker 1: And they've updated this list as recently as May 2022.

492
00:31:16,344 --> 00:31:18,428
Speaker 1: So just, you know, last month.

493
00:31:20,431 --> 00:31:22,516
Speaker 1: So they just been updating this forum post.

494
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:26,888
Speaker 1: And it's like, yep, you can get some creative music system, Yamaha, YMF262.

495
00:31:29,091 --> 00:31:29,392
Speaker 1: Right.

496
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:39,171
Speaker 0: Sound Blaster's crystal, whatever is all kinds of different, terrifying urge to spin up the old Sound Blaster all 32.

497
00:31:39,171 --> 00:31:39,371
Speaker 1: Right.

498
00:31:39,431 --> 00:31:44,560
Speaker 1: But, you know, here are, you know, some of these are actually people who have produced boards for sale.

499
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,950
Speaker 1: Some of them are plans for boards that you can like put together yourself, all sorts of things here.

500
00:31:51,070 --> 00:32:01,050
Speaker 1: But if you're interested in, you know, replicating the sounds of old computers with new computers, this is the link for you to click on.

501
00:32:02,211 --> 00:32:04,878
Speaker 0: In the moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book, Nine Fox Gambit.

502
00:32:04,898 --> 00:32:05,560
Speaker 0: We're done with it.

503
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:09,290
Speaker 0: The only reason we didn't do a show on Thursday is because we were busy.

504
00:32:09,931 --> 00:32:11,734
Speaker 0: So and I think we're going to be busy on Wednesday.

505
00:32:11,754 --> 00:32:12,937
Speaker 0: So no show on Wednesday this week.

506
00:32:12,977 --> 00:32:18,188
Speaker 0: But next week on Thursday, even recorded in advance, that will be the Nine Fox Gambit show.

507
00:32:18,208 --> 00:32:18,950
Speaker 0: We're done with the book.

508
00:32:20,354 --> 00:32:23,201
Speaker 1: That'll be the last show before I have to start another job.

509
00:32:23,221 --> 00:32:26,470
Speaker 1: Unless they decide to unhire me before I start.

510
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:27,751
Speaker 0: Exciting times.

511
00:32:28,372 --> 00:32:29,314
Speaker 0: Legitimately exciting.

512
00:32:29,454 --> 00:32:31,698
Speaker 0: But Nine Fox Gambit's real good.

513
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:33,020
Speaker 0: I got a lot to say about it.

514
00:32:33,621 --> 00:32:38,890
Speaker 0: And we're not going to talk about the second book in that book club book episode.

515
00:32:39,371 --> 00:32:44,641
Speaker 0: But I will say that having read most of the second book in the series, I'm going to finish the series.

516
00:32:44,741 --> 00:32:46,545
Speaker 0: I mean, granted, I think you always finish the series.

517
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,190
Speaker 0: I was about to say, I don't think that was your rim series finisher.

518
00:32:49,370 --> 00:32:50,091
Speaker 0: The cost.

519
00:32:50,111 --> 00:32:55,400
Speaker 0: I was about to say, Scott was probably going to point out that with one exception, I've never not finished a series.

520
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:56,182
Speaker 0: I fucking read all four.

521
00:32:56,282 --> 00:33:01,010
Speaker 1: Every single time I've made a book club selection, that was the first book of a series.

522
00:33:01,350 --> 00:33:05,557
Speaker 1: Rim has gone on to finish that series and I have usually not done so.

523
00:33:05,737 --> 00:33:09,283
Speaker 0: Wheel of Time, you followed a little further than I expected.

524
00:33:09,544 --> 00:33:12,669
Speaker 1: I read, I don't know, it might have been four or five wheels of time.

525
00:33:12,709 --> 00:33:13,430
Speaker 1: I don't know how many.

526
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:14,791
Speaker 1: There's at least a few.

527
00:33:15,152 --> 00:33:17,957
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, a month later, I was like, hey, I'm on book 13.

528
00:33:17,957 --> 00:33:18,758
Speaker 0: And you were like, what?

529
00:33:19,018 --> 00:33:21,542
Speaker 1: I've read every published Prince of Nothing book.

530
00:33:21,883 --> 00:33:22,143
Speaker 0: Yep.

531
00:33:22,344 --> 00:33:26,190
Speaker 0: And I doubt there'll be any more, which I highly doubt there'll ever be any more.

532
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:29,113
Speaker 0: Little troublesome because I would like to know.

533
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:29,894
Speaker 0: But anyway.

534
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:31,195
Speaker 1: Anyway.

535
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:33,298
Speaker 0: But I'm enjoying the Nine Fox Gambit.

536
00:33:33,578 --> 00:33:35,561
Speaker 0: By Thursday, I got to pick what the next book club book is.

537
00:33:35,581 --> 00:33:36,762
Speaker 0: I got a few ideas.

538
00:33:38,144 --> 00:33:42,690
Speaker 0: As much as I want to pick it, I'm not going to pick Emily Wilson's newer translation of a different work.

539
00:33:42,790 --> 00:33:45,853
Speaker 1: Because, well, I mean, yeah, it's like, you know, that's.

540
00:33:45,993 --> 00:33:47,095
Speaker 1: I'm going to read that for sure.

541
00:33:47,155 --> 00:33:48,236
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm going to read that.

542
00:33:48,736 --> 00:33:54,923
Speaker 1: The point is, is like, stop just picking sequels and things related to existing book club books.

543
00:33:55,203 --> 00:33:57,025
Speaker 1: You know, it would be preferable to get variety.

544
00:33:57,085 --> 00:33:57,245
Speaker 1: Right.

545
00:33:57,305 --> 00:34:01,610
Speaker 1: If every book club book was something, you know, going down a new road and not rehashing an old road.

546
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:06,755
Speaker 0: I will resist the urge, at least for one more cycle, to pick a nonfiction book, though.

547
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:08,235
Speaker 0: But I'm going to warn you now.

548
00:34:08,857 --> 00:34:13,481
Speaker 0: My next book club book after this one will very likely be nonfiction.

549
00:34:15,443 --> 00:34:17,585
Speaker 0: I love me some nonfiction.

550
00:34:19,987 --> 00:34:21,909
Speaker 0: Don't worry, this will be fiction and maybe pulp.

551
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:22,489
Speaker 0: Well, I'm thinking.

552
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:24,351
Speaker 1: I'll just I'll just pick some computer book.

553
00:34:24,371 --> 00:34:25,371
Speaker 1: That's not fiction, right?

554
00:34:25,853 --> 00:34:31,056
Speaker 0: I mean, you could just read anything you pick.

555
00:34:31,217 --> 00:34:39,063
Speaker 0: Just gives me the opportunity if I so be if I feel that it is justified to bust out my favorite count, the count.

556
00:34:39,223 --> 00:34:43,427
Speaker 1: It's like, can I can I take structure and interpretation of computer programs as a book club book?

557
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:46,589
Speaker 0: I mean, if you do count of Monte Cristo is going to be the next book club book.

558
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:47,550
Speaker 0: And that book.

559
00:34:47,570 --> 00:34:47,989
Speaker 0: I don't know.

560
00:34:48,010 --> 00:34:50,831
Speaker 1: I don't know if you would understand what.

561
00:34:50,891 --> 00:34:56,056
Speaker 1: the art of programming by Newt this book.

562
00:34:56,136 --> 00:34:57,036
Speaker 1: Is that even going to work?

563
00:34:57,557 --> 00:35:00,339
Speaker 0: If you pick that, what you know what?

564
00:35:00,479 --> 00:35:05,302
Speaker 0: I could do some technical like Newton, NATO doctrine book or some bullshit.

565
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:06,563
Speaker 0: The stuff that I read for fun.

566
00:35:07,604 --> 00:35:09,265
Speaker 0: I'm not saying you wouldn't understand it.

567
00:35:09,345 --> 00:35:10,406
Speaker 0: I just don't think you'd like it.

568
00:35:11,086 --> 00:35:11,546
Speaker 1: I'll be.

569
00:35:11,566 --> 00:35:15,749
Speaker 1: you know, just, you know, if you want to humor me, I guess I'll just ask you to do this.

570
00:35:15,809 --> 00:35:16,850
Speaker 1: I can't make that right.

571
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:18,391
Speaker 1: But go S.I.C.P.

572
00:35:18,411 --> 00:35:19,432
Speaker 1: You can just read it for free.

573
00:35:20,032 --> 00:35:21,213
Speaker 0: I wrote it before.

574
00:35:21,973 --> 00:35:23,515
Speaker 1: Go try to read the first chapter.

575
00:35:25,236 --> 00:35:27,077
Speaker 1: It's doubt it'll end with some.

576
00:35:27,417 --> 00:35:28,138
Speaker 1: it's a textbook.

577
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:31,520
Speaker 1: So it'll end with some quiz questions, I guess, in the first chapter.

578
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:31,980
Speaker 1: Yeah.

579
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:35,263
Speaker 1: And just see if you can even understand what the fuck is going on.

580
00:35:35,363 --> 00:35:41,787
Speaker 0: It's tough because I am a computer professional and a technologist, but I am an information technologist.

581
00:35:41,987 --> 00:35:43,868
Speaker 0: I am not a computer scientist.

582
00:35:44,629 --> 00:35:44,889
Speaker 1: Yeah.

583
00:35:45,189 --> 00:35:45,469
Speaker 1: Anyway.

584
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:46,210
Speaker 0: Yeah.

585
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:52,215
Speaker 0: Otherwise, Pax West, there will very, very likely be at least one gig nights panel there.

586
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:55,177
Speaker 0: But the odds are it'll be either just me or just me and Emily.

587
00:35:55,497 --> 00:35:58,500
Speaker 0: Emily will be there for some other professional reasons.

588
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:03,824
Speaker 0: I can't say that we'll be at any specific cons beyond that.

589
00:36:03,965 --> 00:36:10,350
Speaker 0: I feel like Scott and I might do a panel together at Pax Unplugged, even if we don't want Pax Unplugged to happen.

590
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:10,610
Speaker 1: Right.

591
00:36:10,650 --> 00:36:15,815
Speaker 1: We've reached the point where where I was just like, you know, yeah, cons are going to happen or not.

592
00:36:15,895 --> 00:36:17,216
Speaker 1: And the answer was not.

593
00:36:17,316 --> 00:36:23,622
Speaker 1: But yeah, now we're at the point where it's like, listen, you know, I don't know if I'm going to go to Pax Unplugged.

594
00:36:23,702 --> 00:36:32,250
Speaker 0: I'll say this of all the Pax's Pax Unplugged requires the least advanced decision from me and Scott to decide if we're going to go.

595
00:36:32,791 --> 00:36:33,953
Speaker 0: It's the least planning.

596
00:36:34,273 --> 00:36:37,399
Speaker 0: It can be a day trip very easily like that's a short trip.

597
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,280
Speaker 0: There's a lot.

598
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:43,690
Speaker 0: it's a lot easier to plan a Pax Unplugged to the last second for us than literally any other Pax.

599
00:36:44,510 --> 00:36:44,630
Speaker 1: Right.

600
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:48,959
Speaker 1: But, you know, we're at the point where it's like, I really would like to go to Pax Unplugged.

601
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:52,747
Speaker 1: You know, I hope other people I know would go there to play games with.

602
00:36:52,848 --> 00:36:54,010
Speaker 1: But who knows what's going to happen.

603
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:54,551
Speaker 0: Yep.

604
00:36:54,691 --> 00:37:00,137
Speaker 0: But I can at least say that I will almost definitely be presenting at least one panel at Pax West.

605
00:37:00,437 --> 00:37:12,050
Speaker 0: But I cannot promise that you will see me at the con at any other point than the panels, because I'll be in Seattle for other reasons and probably not hanging out mostly alone in the convention center for four days.

606
00:37:14,231 --> 00:37:16,154
Speaker 1: The website is coming along very nicely.

607
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:24,930
Speaker 1: I'm just about done with the part of the website that you won't see, which is the tooling that will let rim upload episodes easily and completely.

608
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:28,818
Speaker 1: It took a long time because I was getting really fancy in terms of the.

609
00:37:29,059 --> 00:37:33,770
Speaker 1: I discussed this before we sorted out the ID three chapters and all kinds of other fancy features.

610
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,215
Speaker 1: So that seems to actually all be coming together.

611
00:37:37,235 --> 00:37:45,670
Speaker 1: The next part I have to work on is basically getting all the data from the old website over to the new website with some sort of ETL process.

612
00:37:46,331 --> 00:37:58,990
Speaker 1: And once that's in place, the the finish line isn't close, but the the the the first finish line, I guess, of take down the old website and put up the new website becomes pretty close.

613
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:04,224
Speaker 1: Only, you know, a small pile of small tasks to accomplish to make that happen.

614
00:38:04,264 --> 00:38:06,170
Speaker 1: You know, verifying all the redirects are correct.

615
00:38:06,270 --> 00:38:21,630
Speaker 0: I don't want to take a moment to highlight and praise Scott here, because gig nights as a philosophy from the beginning, one thing that we were both like really, really mad about is when links break and people don't follow the basic contract of the Internet.

616
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:29,630
Speaker 0: And this would all be a lot easier if we didn't insist on never breaking a URL and never taking down content we have published.

617
00:38:30,732 --> 00:38:35,149
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, you got to realize, like the geek nights website was at first a WordPress, I think.

618
00:38:35,730 --> 00:38:35,870
Speaker 1: Yeah.

619
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:41,961
Speaker 1: And so if you have some link to some old WordPress posting, it's like it's.

620
00:38:42,141 --> 00:38:43,724
Speaker 1: I believe it would still work now.

621
00:38:43,864 --> 00:38:46,549
Speaker 1: And I'm going to make sure it continues to still work and redirect to.

622
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:50,275
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, it's like never mind the cruft of.

623
00:38:50,756 --> 00:38:54,422
Speaker 0: we were using the advanced features of Libsyn when Libsyn launched.

624
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:56,646
Speaker 0: Those features are no longer the advanced features.

625
00:38:56,906 --> 00:38:59,330
Speaker 0: They are charitably called the legacy features.

626
00:39:00,032 --> 00:39:00,414
Speaker 1: Right.

627
00:39:00,957 --> 00:39:03,150
Speaker 0: I think we are literally their oldest customer.

628
00:39:04,311 --> 00:39:05,734
Speaker 1: It's quite possible we could be.

629
00:39:06,736 --> 00:39:13,490
Speaker 1: But yeah, so, you know, sorting out all that shit will replace the old website with the new one as soon as the new one achieves feature parity.

630
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:28,310
Speaker 1: And then at that point, the website, the new website will be open source on GitHub and you will be able to watch the progress and also submit, you know, if you want to help out, if you have the skills to do so.

631
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:33,490
Speaker 0: And, you know, if you're trying to start a podcast, guess what will be a really cool framework you could use?

632
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:39,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, it might be difficult to just copy the website and deploy it yourself.

633
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:43,008
Speaker 0: Because it is it is made for the kind of thing that we do.

634
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:44,451
Speaker 1: Yeah.

635
00:39:44,711 --> 00:39:54,570
Speaker 1: You know, but regardless, you know, the progress has been happening, especially since I haven't had any work to do, but I haven't done any work on it in, say, three or four days because I've been doing other stuff.

636
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,017
Speaker 1: But I'm going to, you know, this week.

637
00:39:56,097 --> 00:39:58,750
Speaker 1: there's going to be some more progress happening, you know, tomorrow.

638
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:11,410
Speaker 0: And the thing is, once the new website is live, that lights a fire under both of us for a lot of the like new kinds of content and experimental stuff and like other projects we want to do.

639
00:40:12,632 --> 00:40:15,710
Speaker 1: So there's already a long list of features to be added to the website.

640
00:40:16,291 --> 00:40:19,810
Speaker 1: So we got to work on those also, but prioritize them and whatnot.

641
00:40:20,030 --> 00:40:20,291
Speaker 1: Yep.

642
00:40:21,573 --> 00:40:29,810
Speaker 0: So, yeah, let's just get right into it with a show that we came up with because our friends are currently arguing about the nature of refrigerators for a bunch of reasons.

643
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:31,272
Speaker 0: So I realize we've.

644
00:40:31,513 --> 00:40:33,057
Speaker 0: we have talked about cooling PCs.

645
00:40:33,337 --> 00:40:34,861
Speaker 0: We've also talked about PC cooling.

646
00:40:35,543 --> 00:40:38,110
Speaker 0: One of the rare instances where I think I snuck in an episode twice.

647
00:40:38,911 --> 00:40:40,176
Speaker 0: We've talked about server rooms.

648
00:40:40,276 --> 00:40:41,300
Speaker 0: We've talked about HVAC.

649
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,449
Speaker 0: Never talked about refrigeration.

650
00:40:45,093 --> 00:40:47,168
Speaker 0: Like as a technology, arguably.

651
00:40:47,631 --> 00:40:52,041
Speaker 1: I mean, we don't need to explain how refrigeration works with compressors and whatnot.

652
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:52,282
Speaker 1: Right.

653
00:40:52,322 --> 00:40:55,630
Speaker 1: You can look that up on YouTube and find better visualizations of it.

654
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:00,490
Speaker 1: I think even RIM's favorite technology guy, whatever, has a video or two on it also.

655
00:41:01,050 --> 00:41:05,290
Speaker 0: Suffice it to say, the only thing you need to know if you don't know is that all refrigeration is a concept.

656
00:41:06,071 --> 00:41:07,935
Speaker 0: It does one of two things and that's it.

657
00:41:07,995 --> 00:41:15,090
Speaker 0: It either removes heat from an environment into a medium in some fashion, like, say, dry ice in a room.

658
00:41:15,471 --> 00:41:25,110
Speaker 0: It's pulling heat into something to cool the space or it is actively pumping heat out of a space into the broader environment.

659
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,394
Speaker 0: It's just a heat pump.

660
00:41:26,755 --> 00:41:27,719
Speaker 0: You Google for heat pump.

661
00:41:28,061 --> 00:41:30,210
Speaker 0: There are plenty of people, like Scott said, who will explain it to you.

662
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,254
Speaker 1: So there's many different methods.

663
00:41:32,395 --> 00:41:37,590
Speaker 1: There's many different methods of doing this that vary sometimes in big ways, sometimes in small ways.

664
00:41:37,890 --> 00:41:40,669
Speaker 1: But, you know, regardless, like that's what you're doing.

665
00:41:41,451 --> 00:41:52,850
Speaker 0: Less than 200 years ago, the primary way a lot of people in America got things like ice was harvesting it from rivers in the winter and storing it under, like, bales of hay.

666
00:41:54,332 --> 00:41:54,514
Speaker 1: Yup.

667
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,169
Speaker 1: I didn't even know where the hell they got dry ice.

668
00:41:59,371 --> 00:42:03,101
Speaker 0: I'm trying to think about, I know about methods from the 1900s to make dry ice.

669
00:42:03,201 --> 00:42:06,770
Speaker 0: I don't know if and how dry ice might have been made before that, actually.

670
00:42:07,152 --> 00:42:10,209
Speaker 0: I don't know the history of dry ice at all, I realize, other than that one thing.

671
00:42:10,289 --> 00:42:10,470
Speaker 0: Anyway.

672
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:22,730
Speaker 1: I do remember, though, my grandfather talking about how back in the day, it's like you look at today and people drive food around and other things that need to be cold in refrigerated trucks.

673
00:42:22,870 --> 00:42:31,370
Speaker 1: Just a big truck that has a refrigerator attached to it and the inside of the truck is cold and now you can drive meat around town in the summer.

674
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:31,711
Speaker 1: Right.

675
00:42:32,232 --> 00:42:40,690
Speaker 1: But he said back in the day, all they would do is just have a truck and throw a piece of dry ice in the truck and maybe put a fan near it.

676
00:42:41,832 --> 00:42:42,476
Speaker 1: And that was it.

677
00:42:42,597 --> 00:42:44,568
Speaker 1: And the truck would be cold as hell.

678
00:42:45,251 --> 00:42:45,531
Speaker 0: Yup.

679
00:42:46,013 --> 00:42:46,474
Speaker 0: All right.

680
00:42:46,495 --> 00:42:46,735
Speaker 0: Yes.

681
00:42:46,816 --> 00:42:50,407
Speaker 0: Dry ice was observed and documented in detail in the 1830s.

682
00:42:52,391 --> 00:42:59,430
Speaker 0: And it looks like in the early 1900s is when manufacturing processes that are not that different from what we do today were invented.

683
00:43:00,214 --> 00:43:02,930
Speaker 1: And Rym has read Wikipedia to you as a service.

684
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,533
Speaker 0: Yup, because I was curious.

685
00:43:04,814 --> 00:43:10,690
Speaker 0: I did not know if they were able to make dry ice in the late 1800s and the answer seems to be sort of.

686
00:43:11,770 --> 00:43:12,111
Speaker 1: Okay.

687
00:43:13,052 --> 00:43:29,050
Speaker 1: Regardless, all the ways of keeping things cold back in the day, meaning up until relatively recently in terms of human history, was get cold shit and put it near the shit that needs to be cold until it runs out and then get more cold shit.

688
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,735
Speaker 1: Even in the 20th century, right?

689
00:43:30,755 --> 00:43:32,019
Speaker 1: You had the icebox, right?

690
00:43:32,039 --> 00:43:33,383
Speaker 1: They didn't have refrigerators in houses.

691
00:43:33,583 --> 00:43:35,910
Speaker 1: You would have someone deliver fucking ice to your house.

692
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:39,899
Speaker 1: You'd put the ice into the bottom of the fridge, right?

693
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,750
Speaker 1: The fridge would be cold until the ice melted and then they would deliver more ice.

694
00:43:43,910 --> 00:43:46,849
Speaker 1: And that's how you kept food in your house from spoiling.

695
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:58,868
Speaker 0: So, my grandparents had, when I was a kid, I might have talked about this on Geek Nights more than a decade ago, they had a general electric refrigerator from the late 1940s.

696
00:44:00,710 --> 00:44:01,856
Speaker 0: And it wasn't their primary fridge.

697
00:44:01,896 --> 00:44:04,288
Speaker 0: They had a more recent fridge in the main house.

698
00:44:05,290 --> 00:44:11,264
Speaker 0: But in the furnace room, they had that old late 40s fridge and it still worked.

699
00:44:11,625 --> 00:44:13,610
Speaker 0: And they were still using it because they thought it was neat.

700
00:44:13,951 --> 00:44:16,578
Speaker 0: It never had any maintenance other than some lubrication at any point.

701
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:18,905
Speaker 0: And as a kid, I was vaguely obsessed with it.

702
00:44:19,185 --> 00:44:20,830
Speaker 0: And all they stored in there was soda pop.

703
00:44:22,411 --> 00:44:25,569
Speaker 0: It had this really cool chunky latching mechanism to open it.

704
00:44:26,490 --> 00:44:27,749
Speaker 1: Yep, that's how they do.

705
00:44:28,030 --> 00:44:29,654
Speaker 0: Yep, and you had to manually defrost it.

706
00:44:29,734 --> 00:44:35,770
Speaker 0: But yeah, so early refrigerators that plugged into an outlet and used electricity, like my grandparents...

707
00:44:35,850 --> 00:44:38,896
Speaker 1: Hold on, there's one thing for the ice boxes, right?

708
00:44:38,916 --> 00:44:45,430
Speaker 1: There's one thing about the ice box that I never knew and still don't know, but I only have a guess.

709
00:44:45,850 --> 00:44:48,844
Speaker 1: Which is that, you know, the ice cube would melt, the big ice cube, right?

710
00:44:49,125 --> 00:44:50,010
Speaker 1: Then they'd bring a new one.

711
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:53,416
Speaker 1: Did you just drain the water down the drain?

712
00:44:54,098 --> 00:44:55,121
Speaker 1: Or drink the water?

713
00:44:55,663 --> 00:44:57,448
Speaker 1: Because the old ice cube melted into water.

714
00:44:57,468 --> 00:44:58,090
Speaker 1: It didn't disappear.

715
00:44:59,650 --> 00:45:00,173
Speaker 1: What did they do?

716
00:45:00,193 --> 00:45:00,997
Speaker 1: Did they pump it out?

717
00:45:01,641 --> 00:45:03,310
Speaker 1: What did they do with the water from the old ice cube?

718
00:45:04,072 --> 00:45:12,650
Speaker 0: So the Wikipedia page doesn't actually say much about it, except it talks a lot about how all nice ice chests had spigots to drain it and catch pans and holding tanks.

719
00:45:13,510 --> 00:45:15,850
Speaker 1: Okay, so you would drain it and it would go down the drain into the sewer?

720
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:17,379
Speaker 0: Yeah, pretty much.

721
00:45:17,621 --> 00:45:18,489
Speaker 0: I doubt people...

722
00:45:18,590 --> 00:45:19,690
Speaker 1: Like down the sink, basically?

723
00:45:20,291 --> 00:45:22,008
Speaker 0: Unless you lived somewhere where... That was my guess.

724
00:45:22,651 --> 00:45:30,190
Speaker 0: If you lived somewhere where you didn't have running water in your house, which, frankly, in the early 1900s in the US, not that uncommon.

725
00:45:30,773 --> 00:45:34,750
Speaker 1: But if you lived in a place without running water, are you really going to be in range of an ice delivery man?

726
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:35,631
Speaker 0: Might have.

727
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:36,474
Speaker 0: Small town.

728
00:45:36,976 --> 00:45:40,129
Speaker 0: A lot of houses in the 20s did not have...

729
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:44,870
Speaker 1: Since it's just water, it is safe to just drain it out into the backyard or some shit, right?

730
00:45:44,910 --> 00:45:44,996
Speaker 1: Yeah.

731
00:45:45,810 --> 00:45:47,570
Speaker 1: As long as you don't drain it on your kitchen floor.

732
00:45:47,830 --> 00:45:54,388
Speaker 0: But we had a beefy dehumidifier in the basement when I was a kid, and we would actually take that water and use it to water the plants in the house.

733
00:45:54,468 --> 00:45:55,090
Speaker 0: Just, why not?

734
00:45:55,992 --> 00:45:56,609
Speaker 1: Yeah, why not?

735
00:45:57,211 --> 00:45:58,272
Speaker 0: But yeah, refrigeration.

736
00:45:58,412 --> 00:46:16,430
Speaker 0: I talk about this a lot on Geek Nights, but in general, one of the most important things you can do if you care about technology is not to just focus on the bleeding edge of the cool new stuff we can do, but to think about technology that works and how it can be distributed more equitably, used more efficiently, etc.

737
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:21,530
Speaker 0: Refrigeration is one of the most important things humans have ever invented.

738
00:46:22,111 --> 00:46:25,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you play Civilization, it gets a whole spot on the tech tree.

739
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:30,010
Speaker 1: I think in every Civilization game that I'm aware of, refrigeration has its own item.

740
00:46:30,451 --> 00:46:32,185
Speaker 0: It's like, "Oh yeah, double food from all your shit

741
00:46:32,226 --> 00:46:32,407
Speaker 0: now!".

742
00:46:33,433 --> 00:46:33,970
Speaker 1: Yup, exactly.

743
00:46:33,970 --> 00:46:35,499
Speaker 0: Your cities can just grow like crazy.

744
00:46:36,163 --> 00:46:37,230
Speaker 0: See, also, sewers.

745
00:46:38,370 --> 00:46:38,541
Speaker 1: Yup.

746
00:46:39,451 --> 00:46:39,836
Speaker 0: Hospitals.

747
00:46:39,856 --> 00:46:41,010
Speaker 0: that comes after hospitals.

748
00:46:43,276 --> 00:46:48,570
Speaker 1: After plumbing, I think refrigeration is the next most important invention for human society.

749
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:49,051
Speaker 0: Yup.

750
00:46:49,494 --> 00:46:50,724
Speaker 0: I mean, it's to the point to where...

751
00:46:51,530 --> 00:46:55,288
Speaker 1: It's dependent on electricity, which at least kind of, right?

752
00:46:55,348 --> 00:46:55,690
Speaker 1: Mostly.

753
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:59,329
Speaker 1: There are plenty... So I guess you could rank electricity higher, kind of.

754
00:46:59,550 --> 00:47:09,210
Speaker 0: But there are plenty of cooling mechanisms that are as effective as modern day refrigeration that uses electricity that do not require electricity.

755
00:47:09,370 --> 00:47:09,990
Speaker 0: There's lots of ways to do it.

756
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:15,170
Speaker 1: That is true, but the vast majority of refrigeration around the world is the electric kind.

757
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:15,751
Speaker 1: Yup.

758
00:47:16,192 --> 00:47:23,310
Speaker 0: But I think the most important thing about it is just that it allowed perishable food to be stored with relative safety.

759
00:47:24,364 --> 00:47:24,509
Speaker 1: Yup.

760
00:47:24,890 --> 00:47:26,013
Speaker 0: Like, beyond everything else.

761
00:47:26,554 --> 00:47:42,030
Speaker 0: Because even in a modern world, in the year 2022, where I have a refrigerator and a freezer, I still have to put a not insignificant amount of mental effort into thinking about the safety of various foods and what should be stored where.

762
00:47:42,170 --> 00:47:43,735
Speaker 0: And can this be frozen?

763
00:47:43,795 --> 00:47:44,939
Speaker 0: Can this be refrigerated?

764
00:47:45,019 --> 00:47:46,122
Speaker 0: Should this be refrigerated?

765
00:47:46,443 --> 00:47:48,830
Speaker 0: Some foods shouldn't be refrigerated, like tomatoes!

766
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:50,973
Speaker 1: But I mean, think about this.

767
00:47:51,053 --> 00:47:53,179
Speaker 1: Back in the day, before refrigeration, right?

768
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:56,328
Speaker 1: It's like, okay, you either had to get everything fresh, or, right?

769
00:47:57,411 --> 00:48:05,778
Speaker 1: You store some food, okay, well then what if, you know, you might have to like... I mean, any food you want to store, you don't have to do some sort of preservation work, right?

770
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:12,310
Speaker 1: Like, you know, maybe can it, or, you know, what's it called?

771
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:16,890
Speaker 1: Like, you know, you can't just save the beef for tomorrow, you gotta make some beef jerky instead, right?

772
00:48:17,030 --> 00:48:18,107
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, stuff like that.

773
00:48:19,910 --> 00:48:21,477
Speaker 0: Like, leftovers were difficult.

774
00:48:21,638 --> 00:48:24,150
Speaker 0: Leftovers like we know them today are basically impossible without refrigeration.

775
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:29,200
Speaker 1: Right, it's like, okay, then you get, it's like, okay, you have this sort of battle going on.

776
00:48:29,261 --> 00:48:30,724
Speaker 1: It's like, do I save food?

777
00:48:30,744 --> 00:48:33,790
Speaker 1: Do I eat food, more food than I can stomach?

778
00:48:34,250 --> 00:48:35,393
Speaker 1: Do I go hungry?

779
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:41,126
Speaker 1: You know, do I eat, do I, the food's older, but do I eat it anyway and risk getting sick?

780
00:48:41,226 --> 00:48:43,050
Speaker 1: Do I even know that the food will make me sick?

781
00:48:43,972 --> 00:48:45,409
Speaker 1: Just have warm meat lying around.

782
00:48:45,890 --> 00:49:02,570
Speaker 0: Yup, and while there are a bunch of adjacent technologies that have achieved similar results, like to keep things cool, like evaporative coolers, like those have existed since ancient times, they are much less reliable, and they're not as controllable.

783
00:49:02,690 --> 00:49:08,770
Speaker 0: The big thing about the refrigeration we're talking about, like a modern fridge, is that you pick a temperature, and it is at that temperature.

784
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:17,610
Speaker 1: Also, you know, you talk about, you know, food traveling, right, so it's like you'd have to eat food that came from somewhere close.

785
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:28,150
Speaker 1: You couldn't eat a food that, you know, wouldn't, a spoilable food, that came from far away, you know, like, you get a fruit from another country, it's like you couldn't have that.

786
00:49:28,370 --> 00:49:31,798
Speaker 1: It would be disgusting by the time it took a boat over, or even if it took a plane.

787
00:49:31,858 --> 00:49:37,110
Speaker 1: somehow, you know, I guess planes and refrigerators were invented around, you know.

788
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:43,270
Speaker 1: But, you know, it's like before the, you know, you'd have to take a boat, and it's like it would be rotten.

789
00:49:43,790 --> 00:49:50,590
Speaker 1: It's like you would never be able to eat that unless you went to the other place, then you could eat the food from there, but you couldn't have brought the food from home, right?

790
00:49:50,610 --> 00:49:53,070
Speaker 1: It would be disgusting by the time you got to the other side, right?

791
00:49:54,410 --> 00:50:05,250
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, on boats, it's like the navies would be bringing around live animals on the boat, because otherwise, it's like if you just had all the animals pre-butchered, it's like guess what, you're not going to make it across the ocean.

792
00:50:05,671 --> 00:50:05,972
Speaker 0: Yup.

793
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:12,209
Speaker 0: Similarly, most of the food they brought was all the food you imagine on a Napoleonic era ship.

794
00:50:13,691 --> 00:50:14,114
Speaker 0: Weevils.

795
00:50:14,234 --> 00:50:16,389
Speaker 0: Weevils and hard bread and salt pork.

796
00:50:17,870 --> 00:50:18,391
Speaker 1: Exactly.

797
00:50:18,471 --> 00:50:21,376
Speaker 1: So, yeah, refrigeration was huge.

798
00:50:22,158 --> 00:50:29,210
Speaker 1: So, modern day, right, you go and you probably just buy a fucking refrigerator, but there's so many different ones now.

799
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:37,310
Speaker 1: When I was a kid, everyone I knew just had the standard refrigerator, which was just freezer on top, fridge on the bottom.

800
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:40,414
Speaker 0: When I was a kid, there were exactly two kinds of fridges.

801
00:50:40,815 --> 00:50:49,790
Speaker 0: Everyone, with a handful of exceptions, had what you describe, and there were a handful of kids whose parents were rich, who lived in the nicer houses and the newer developments in the suburbs.

802
00:50:50,311 --> 00:51:00,090
Speaker 0: They had the early versions of those modern fancy refrigerators with a bunch of features on them, like an ice thing and a water thing in the front, and the doors that opened to the sides.

803
00:51:00,230 --> 00:51:04,003
Speaker 1: I feel like I didn't see any of those until the mid to late 90s.

804
00:51:04,023 --> 00:51:06,090
Speaker 1: They probably existed earlier, but I didn't see any.

805
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:14,990
Speaker 0: I saw them in the houses of a handful of kids I knew in middle school, who were way richer than us and lived in way nicer suburbs than we did.

806
00:51:14,990 --> 00:51:20,990
Speaker 1: What I did see were people who had, you know, larger houses, they had garages and large basements.

807
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:29,950
Speaker 0: Oh, we had a beverage fridge, we had a fridge in the kitchen, and we had a, basically, when we bought that new fridge, the old fridge wasn't that broken, it was just like old and inefficient.

808
00:51:30,350 --> 00:51:32,470
Speaker 0: We stuck it in the garage, and that became the soda fridge.

809
00:51:32,810 --> 00:51:39,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, we might have done that if we had had such a space, right, in our house, but we also didn't drink soda, so it wasn't really a thing.

810
00:51:40,371 --> 00:51:42,090
Speaker 1: But people had chest freezers.

811
00:51:42,695 --> 00:51:44,510
Speaker 0: We also had a chest freezer.

812
00:51:45,750 --> 00:51:58,950
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the people with the chest freezers, for example, right, I remember you'd buy your turkey on Thanksgiving, and you'd go to the person's house who had the chest freezer, and leave it in there until Thanksgiving.

813
00:51:59,190 --> 00:52:01,110
Speaker 1: Then you would go there the day before Thanksgiving.

814
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:03,550
Speaker 0: If I had enough space for it, I would 100% have a chest freezer today.

815
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,850
Speaker 1: Because we didn't have room in our regular fridge to store a whole fucking turkey.

816
00:52:06,190 --> 00:52:09,690
Speaker 0: I would absolutely have a chest freezer if there was anywhere to put it in this apartment.

817
00:52:11,002 --> 00:52:11,169
Speaker 1: Yeah.

818
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:26,450
Speaker 0: There's also those cool, there are the Peltier, like there's chest freezers and chest refrigerators that are designed for long-term storage to be energy efficient, and they tend to have a really weak-sauce Peltier device instead of the more traditional cooling.

819
00:52:26,951 --> 00:52:33,350
Speaker 0: And they basically take a long time to get cold, but if you don't open often, they just stay cold using almost no electricity.

820
00:52:34,071 --> 00:52:40,630
Speaker 1: I mean, the best memory I had of chest freezers was the people across the street had one in the garage, and that's where they put the popsicles.

821
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:43,057
Speaker 1: It was like, you didn't have to go in their house to go and get a popsicle.

822
00:52:43,077 --> 00:52:45,124
Speaker 1: You could just be like, "Bam, you're already outside having a good

823
00:52:45,144 --> 00:52:45,405
Speaker 1: time.".

824
00:52:45,445 --> 00:52:46,770
Speaker 1: Just like, boom, popsicle right there.

825
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:55,730
Speaker 0: I remember going into random friends' parents' garages and just taking ice cream and popsicles out of their chest freezer, probably without permission, because the kids would all just kind of do this.

826
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:00,950
Speaker 1: It was equal opportunity, except for our house, because ours were in the freezer.

827
00:53:04,131 --> 00:53:14,130
Speaker 0: Though, what I do, the thing that always did bother me is every fridge I've ever seen that has an external port for water and ice, that shit never works.

828
00:53:14,990 --> 00:53:18,740
Speaker 1: Okay, well, first of all, it works sometimes, right?

829
00:53:19,141 --> 00:53:22,810
Speaker 1: The thing that bothers me is, A, inconsistent design.

830
00:53:23,251 --> 00:53:28,960
Speaker 1: A lot of times, I try to use it, and the design of what I'm supposed to do is not obvious.

831
00:53:29,001 --> 00:53:34,330
Speaker 1: Some of them, there's the plastic thing, you push your cup into it, and it's like, "Ah, that should make water come

832
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:34,490
Speaker 1: out.".

833
00:53:34,570 --> 00:53:37,538
Speaker 1: And some of them, that makes the ice come out, and some of them makes the water come out.

834
00:53:37,578 --> 00:53:38,561
Speaker 1: Some of them don't even have that.

835
00:53:39,022 --> 00:53:41,890
Speaker 1: Some of them, you gotta push buttons on the face of the thing to make stuff happen.

836
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:47,670
Speaker 0: A lot of times, they have a dial and a switch, and you set it to what you want to happen when the plastic thing gets hit.

837
00:53:48,151 --> 00:53:49,936
Speaker 1: And there should only ever be two buttons.

838
00:53:50,257 --> 00:53:51,781
Speaker 1: Spit out water and spit out ice.

839
00:53:51,821 --> 00:53:53,004
Speaker 1: Some of these things have more buttons.

840
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:54,327
Speaker 1: What the fuck are those buttons for?

841
00:53:54,548 --> 00:53:55,390
Speaker 1: Like, seriously?

842
00:53:55,970 --> 00:54:00,190
Speaker 0: Crushed ice versus chopped ice, even though they end up being kind of the same on most of these things.

843
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:01,572
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't give a shit.

844
00:54:01,592 --> 00:54:03,675
Speaker 1: If you give a shit about that, you got problems, right?

845
00:54:03,715 --> 00:54:13,090
Speaker 1: And then, the other thing is, I guess if you're extra fancy, I imagine, I've never seen one, there must be one out there that will carbonate the water, right?

846
00:54:14,211 --> 00:54:21,090
Speaker 1: Which I don't drink, but, you know, okay, if that's the case, I could make, you know, if you're that person, I could maybe say the third button is okay.

847
00:54:21,190 --> 00:54:36,590
Speaker 0: Well, I guess I'm always, I never like when a half-assed version of a feature is put into an inappropriate device, as opposed to, most people probably don't need this feature, and if people who really want or need it get a dedicated, specialized device to do that thing.

848
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:42,290
Speaker 0: Like, if I were that guy, I would have a specialized ice maker, like, in my bar.

849
00:54:43,471 --> 00:54:50,690
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, if you are in a place where, you know, let's say, you know, the water is not so drinkable from the tap, right?

850
00:54:51,794 --> 00:54:52,035
Speaker 1: Yeah.

851
00:54:52,116 --> 00:54:54,730
Speaker 0: And you want to filter it and keep it cold.

852
00:54:55,070 --> 00:54:57,819
Speaker 1: Even for me, like, my water is drinkable from the tap.

853
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,950
Speaker 1: I'm in New York City, like, the best water, among the best waters, right?

854
00:55:01,451 --> 00:55:06,326
Speaker 1: But, a lot of our fridge space is taken up by water pitchers, water bottles, right?

855
00:55:06,888 --> 00:55:07,650
Speaker 1: Things of that nature.

856
00:55:08,251 --> 00:55:19,850
Speaker 1: If we had the spigot on the front of the fridge, right, then I could save a lot of space in the fridge by not having all this water, like, saved up and all the time.

857
00:55:20,391 --> 00:55:23,830
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, I could drink from the tap, but the point is to make it cold first.

858
00:55:24,931 --> 00:55:28,970
Speaker 0: At least our tap is shockingly cold, even in the dead of summer, for some reason.

859
00:55:29,110 --> 00:55:30,054
Speaker 0: Sometimes, sometimes.

860
00:55:30,074 --> 00:55:33,630
Speaker 1: But it is a useful feature to have for space savings, right?

861
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:40,429
Speaker 1: The ice that goes right into the glass, eh, okay, me, eh, you know.

862
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:50,290
Speaker 0: I just find that most of the times, when I try to use one of those things at someone else's house, or, like, in an Airbnb, or anywhere that I encounter one, they fail in some way.

863
00:55:50,610 --> 00:55:56,368
Speaker 0: Even the last time I visited my brother, I go to use the ice maker, and suddenly he's like, "Ah, the ice maker doesn't really work, don't do it, don't touch

864
00:55:56,428 --> 00:55:56,468
Speaker 0: it!".

865
00:55:57,276 --> 00:55:57,487
Speaker 1: Yep.

866
00:55:57,871 --> 00:55:59,789
Speaker 0: I just feel like they're cheap and they tend to break.

867
00:56:00,611 --> 00:56:05,630
Speaker 1: Our fridge has the kind of ice maker I like, which is the one where you can turn it on and off.

868
00:56:05,890 --> 00:56:09,910
Speaker 1: Right now it's on, because I just used a bunch of ice, but I turn it off soon once the bucket fills up.

869
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:17,430
Speaker 1: But basically, there's a bucket in the freezer, and you just turn it on, and you wait, and eventually the freezer bucket is full of ice, just tons of ice.

870
00:56:18,891 --> 00:56:26,950
Speaker 1: And I like this because, A, you know, ice cube trays, I used to use those, and it's like you had to fill them, carry them to the freezer full of water.

871
00:56:27,711 --> 00:56:37,130
Speaker 1: You can't really have that many trays in the freezer because there's not enough room, and you don't have that much ice, and then it sublimates if you don't use it quickly enough, and then you don't have ice when you want it.

872
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:43,309
Speaker 1: The bucket full of ice in the freezer is just like, "Yep, there's just a fucking bucket full of ice, you can go wild with the

873
00:56:43,470 --> 00:56:43,570
Speaker 1: ice.".

874
00:56:43,650 --> 00:56:49,090
Speaker 1: It's like, oh, you want to, you know, you can put a couple cubes in a glass, you're like, just dip your glass in there like you're scooping.

875
00:56:49,610 --> 00:56:51,256
Speaker 1: You just scoop it all the way full, right?

876
00:56:51,276 --> 00:56:54,830
Speaker 1: Take a water bottle, just jam it with ice all the way to the top.

877
00:56:54,930 --> 00:56:59,190
Speaker 1: You don't get to give a shit, you get so much ice, and you don't have to, you know, you don't have to work.

878
00:56:59,770 --> 00:57:06,150
Speaker 1: You don't have to like, you know, remember to manage the ice, or to make cubes, or to fill anything, it's just, it's always there.

879
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:12,910
Speaker 1: And if it ever runs low, you push the button until it's full again, and then when it's done, you push the button one more time.

880
00:57:13,090 --> 00:57:18,059
Speaker 0: Now for whatever reason, I don't use ice, like, I almost never use ice in my day-to-day life.

881
00:57:25,251 --> 00:57:30,870
Speaker 0: So all I have is one little silicone tray that makes four giant ice cubes with a cover on it so they don't sublimate.

882
00:57:32,992 --> 00:57:36,750
Speaker 0: And anytime I use two of them, I put some water in there, so I always have ice cubes.

883
00:57:37,390 --> 00:57:40,590
Speaker 1: I mean, this time of year, you know, I'm filling coolers, I'm filling water bottles.

884
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:41,272
Speaker 1: Coolers!

885
00:57:41,454 --> 00:57:44,110
Speaker 0: I just go to the bodega and buy a bag of ice for a dollar.

886
00:57:44,230 --> 00:57:46,889
Speaker 1: That costs money, and you gotta carry the ice, and...

887
00:57:47,050 --> 00:57:47,687
Speaker 0: Bodega's right there!

888
00:57:49,113 --> 00:57:50,190
Speaker 1: It's still, it's work, right?

889
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:53,110
Speaker 0: Also, our freezer's usually pretty much full of food.

890
00:57:54,751 --> 00:57:56,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, ours is not that full of food.

891
00:57:56,178 --> 00:57:57,284
Speaker 1: There's only two people living here.

892
00:57:57,304 --> 00:57:58,450
Speaker 1: Why would you have that much food in there?

893
00:57:58,550 --> 00:57:59,607
Speaker 0: Well, we keep a lot of stuff in there.

894
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:01,040
Speaker 1: Eat it!

895
00:58:01,770 --> 00:58:02,590
Speaker 0: Yeah, then we kill it with more!

896
00:58:07,732 --> 00:58:10,790
Speaker 0: But living in an apartment is a little annoying because there are better fridges.

897
00:58:10,990 --> 00:58:15,390
Speaker 0: Like, I get a much better fridge than what we have, but I don't own this place, the building owns the fridge.

898
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:18,630
Speaker 1: Yeah, when you rent, you don't have a choice of fridge, so I've never bought a fridge in my life.

899
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:20,208
Speaker 0: Yup, as much as I would want to.

900
00:58:21,450 --> 00:58:25,230
Speaker 0: And, what's funny is a lot of people, even now, I see our friends still debating fridges.

901
00:58:26,090 --> 00:58:38,430
Speaker 0: A lot of people have a lot of shocking misconceptions about, like, how different configurations of fridges being more or less efficient, and it's almost all aesthetics and style, and very little of it affects the efficiency.

902
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:45,010
Speaker 0: But, from what I do know, a handful of things that people would think would be more efficient end up being way less efficient.

903
00:58:45,090 --> 00:58:51,130
Speaker 0: Like, case in point, the drawer freezer, those things just jettison cold air compared to a regular one.

904
00:58:52,090 --> 00:58:59,690
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, well, people, I don't know how many people realize that, like, you know, you have a fridge, the cooling is all happening in the freezer, right?

905
00:58:59,790 --> 00:59:10,210
Speaker 1: The fridge, part of your refrigerator, is actually just getting, sort of, you know, the cool air left over from the freezer, sort of goes into the fridge by, like, a vent, and that's what makes the fridge cold.

906
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:13,910
Speaker 1: All the actual active cooling is happening in the freezer zone.

907
00:59:14,070 --> 00:59:24,990
Speaker 1: So, the classic style with the freezer on top, you know, cold air goes down, warm air goes up, is much more efficient than the freezer on bottom kind, right?

908
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:29,590
Speaker 1: Because the cold air from the freezer just naturally goes down into the fridge on its own.

909
00:59:30,330 --> 00:59:33,990
Speaker 1: If you had to make the cold air go up, well, now, you know, it's not so simple, right?

910
00:59:33,990 --> 00:59:35,909
Speaker 1: You might have to have a little fan in there, who knows?

911
00:59:36,431 --> 00:59:52,230
Speaker 0: Now, I will admit, if I owned a place and I were rich, I would be really interested in one of those integrated refrigeration systems, where you don't have just one big fridge, you just have some of your cupboards are just refrigerated to different temperatures.

912
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:53,711
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

913
00:59:53,731 --> 01:00:05,467
Speaker 1: I mean, as inefficient and wasteful as that is, the convenience and amazingness of, like, you know, "Hey, next to your cabinet full of glasses is a refrigerated cabinet full of

914
01:00:05,528 --> 01:00:05,989
Speaker 1: beverages.".

915
01:00:06,370 --> 01:00:13,670
Speaker 1: And then, you know, next to where the cutting board is, right, in your work area, well, that's where the vegetable fridge is, right?

916
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:24,910
Speaker 0: But also, depending, that could be more efficient if done in a nuanced way around things, like, not everything needs to be cooled to the temperature of a refrigerator.

917
01:00:24,990 --> 01:00:29,450
Speaker 0: Then we pick that temperature because that is safe for pretty much anything for a short amount of time.

918
01:00:30,211 --> 01:00:32,750
Speaker 0: Like, that is a food safety temperature we've chosen.

919
01:00:33,010 --> 01:00:38,650
Speaker 0: But, like, a lot of vegetables, they'll keep on— Humidity also could be customized per fridge, yeah.

920
01:00:38,730 --> 01:00:42,223
Speaker 0: If they're just—they just need to be kept at a consistent temperature.

921
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:53,370
Speaker 0: that's slightly lower than room temperature, so a really weak-sauce Peltier system for the vegetable crisper could mean you don't have to waste all this energy cooling all your lettuces to 40 degrees Fahrenheit.

922
01:00:53,491 --> 01:00:56,310
Speaker 0: Like, you could have—you could actually probably save energy.

923
01:00:56,910 --> 01:01:00,710
Speaker 0: But, it's hard to calculate that because those are bespoke systems.

924
01:01:00,870 --> 01:01:02,249
Speaker 0: Like, that's not something you just go and buy.

925
01:01:02,631 --> 01:01:04,550
Speaker 0: That's something a rich person gets installed into their house.

926
01:01:05,991 --> 01:01:10,990
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, well, I mean, there are non-rich people who do have multiple fridges for other reasons, right?

927
01:01:11,090 --> 01:01:16,670
Speaker 1: Most notably, people who keep kosher, and they gotta separate their meat fridge from their dairy fridge.

928
01:01:16,870 --> 01:01:17,152
Speaker 1: Yup.

929
01:01:17,634 --> 01:01:20,390
Speaker 0: I used to have because it was a gift, and it was actually really useful.

930
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:29,066
Speaker 0: I had a wine fridge that—all it did was chill wine, but it—you know, wine doesn't need to get that cold, so it saved energy because it just kept the wine at the temperature.

931
01:01:29,087 --> 01:01:29,649
Speaker 0: you would drink it.

932
01:01:30,070 --> 01:01:36,090
Speaker 0: You type a number in, it just keeps it—but when that broke, I did not replace it because now I live in a tiny apartment.

933
01:01:36,990 --> 01:01:37,192
Speaker 1: Yup.

934
01:01:38,925 --> 01:01:39,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't know.

935
01:01:39,710 --> 01:01:43,950
Speaker 1: But yeah, I guess there's, you know, the last thing I guess would be the other arrangements of fridges, right?

936
01:01:44,030 --> 01:01:58,110
Speaker 0: A lot of people seem to have strong opinions about, like, the doors, whether you should get the splitting doors or— Well, my only preference is there is anything where there's a divider between the two left and right side of the fridge seems just a complete waste of space.

937
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:04,284
Speaker 1: Yeah, mine has the top doors split in the middle, but the inside of the fridge is one cavern.

938
01:02:04,324 --> 01:02:06,590
Speaker 1: It's not—there's no split in the fridge.

939
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,034
Speaker 0: Yeah.

940
01:02:08,074 --> 01:02:12,370
Speaker 0: I like just one big cavern, and then a smaller one big cavern for the freezer.

941
01:02:14,692 --> 01:02:21,050
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I really don't care too much about the—people have such strong opinions, like, I don't care about the doors, right?

942
01:02:21,110 --> 01:02:33,090
Speaker 1: I care about the efficiency, and I care about how much space is inside to store food as long as it's enough for the food I have, and I care that it fits in the kitchen and, you know, fits nicely and doesn't stick out too far.

943
01:02:33,090 --> 01:02:41,330
Speaker 0: Which again, living in an apartment, like, one minor annoyance of our fridge, you know, our apartment's big, but it's still— It doesn't swing out and hit things or block the way or, you know.

944
01:02:41,611 --> 01:02:50,070
Speaker 0: There is no way to remove the left bottom crisper drawer from our fridge without removing the entire refrigerator door.

945
01:02:51,490 --> 01:02:56,170
Speaker 0: Because you cannot open the fridge door all the way around because it's up against the wall.

946
01:02:58,371 --> 01:03:05,230
Speaker 0: And that's just an annoyance, there's literally no way around that, and that is not a concern for pretty much anyone who lives in a house, but if you live in an apartment—

947
01:03:05,310 --> 01:03:11,170
Speaker 1: That is a chore I do, like, once a year, is take all the things out of the fridge and clean them, all the shelves and the drawers and everything.

948
01:03:11,210 --> 01:03:19,330
Speaker 0: That one shelf, what I do is, when it's time to clean it— Yep, I open the fridge door, and then I clean it as fast as possible.

949
01:03:20,973 --> 01:03:22,390
Speaker 0: Like, I'm in and out of there so quick.

950
01:03:23,371 --> 01:03:23,572
Speaker 1: Yep.

951
01:03:24,255 --> 01:03:27,350
Speaker 1: It is nice to have a rearrangeable shelf, you know, and such and such.

952
01:03:27,656 --> 01:03:27,744
Speaker 0: Yep.

953
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:36,370
Speaker 1: Oh, the one other feature that our current fridge has that actually I do like is that if you accidentally leave the door open, it'll start beeping at you.

954
01:03:36,550 --> 01:03:36,614
Speaker 1: Ooh.

955
01:03:36,910 --> 01:03:42,590
Speaker 1: It would have been a great help earlier in life, but our fridges did not do that when I was young.

956
01:03:42,610 --> 01:03:50,430
Speaker 0: So once, one time, I think I talked about this in Geek Nights, we lost everything in the fridge because the door, like, a pressure thing happened, and the door popped open a tiny bit.

957
01:03:51,091 --> 01:03:53,390
Speaker 0: There was this, it was opened by, I think, the tiniest bit.

958
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:59,670
Speaker 0: And actually, a lot of the fridge, especially the lower part, still stayed, like, pretty cold.

959
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:05,269
Speaker 0: But it was just open wide enough to where the light bulb in there turned on.

960
01:04:05,630 --> 01:04:15,190
Speaker 0: And that light bulb was an incandescent bulb pumping out 20 to 40 watts of heat, and it basically cooked everything in the top of the fridge.

961
01:04:16,190 --> 01:04:17,030
Speaker 0: So I had to throw out everything.

962
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:22,050
Speaker 0: Had it not been an incandescent bulb, we probably would have lost almost nothing in that incident.

963
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:32,228
Speaker 0: So I did replace both bulbs in our fridge with fridge-safe, cold-temperature-rated LEDs, and they output basically zero heat.

964
01:04:32,429 --> 01:04:33,130
Speaker 0: Like, it's kind of amazing.

965
01:04:33,311 --> 01:04:39,510
Speaker 1: My previous fridge, my previous apartment, I replaced the bulbs, but in this current fridge, I just have whatever it came with.

966
01:04:39,630 --> 01:04:43,528
Speaker 1: I don't even know, I guess if they die, yeah, I'm gonna replace them with the best possible LED.

967
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:46,890
Speaker 0: Does he gotta get an LED that's designed for fridges?

968
01:04:47,671 --> 01:04:50,290
Speaker 1: Oh yeah, obviously you always put a fridge-specific bulb in there.

969
01:04:50,770 --> 01:04:50,839
Speaker 1: Yup.

970
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:54,322
Speaker 0: But, uh, yeah, refrigeration.

971
01:04:54,442 --> 01:04:55,670
Speaker 0: Super important to humans.

972
01:04:56,890 --> 01:05:00,429
Speaker 0: I camp and hike, I like camping and hiking and all that stuff.

973
01:05:00,931 --> 01:05:02,869
Speaker 0: And, uh, can't just bring a fridge with you.

974
01:05:05,191 --> 01:05:09,450
Speaker 1: I guess the last thing is that, you know, a lot of other features have been added to fridges these days.

975
01:05:09,670 --> 01:05:18,210
Speaker 1: They're trying to, you know, like, they get some fucking computers in there, and like, things to tell you how much food is left, or, you know, do some smart fridge bullshit.

976
01:05:19,031 --> 01:05:20,850
Speaker 1: All that stuff sucks, get that shit out of here.

977
01:05:21,010 --> 01:05:21,085
Speaker 1: Yup.

978
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:23,010
Speaker 1: Do not connect your refrigerator to the internet.

979
01:05:23,914 --> 01:05:25,321
Speaker 1: I don't want a fridge with a screen on it.

980
01:05:25,441 --> 01:05:27,350
Speaker 1: No, I don't want none of that shit, get that out of here.

981
01:05:27,630 --> 01:05:37,050
Speaker 0: Yup, unless the fridge were smart enough to, on its own, without me having to do anything, know an inventory of everything that's in it, and provide that to me via an open format.

982
01:05:37,310 --> 01:05:39,449
Speaker 1: That's what they say they can do, but, uh, no.

983
01:05:40,290 --> 01:05:46,930
Speaker 0: Yup, call me when they do that without me having to configure anything, and without me having to connect it to the internet.

984
01:05:47,835 --> 01:05:48,006
Speaker 1: Yeah.

985
01:05:53,965 --> 01:05:56,100
Speaker 0: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
