1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,428
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday, September 19th 2018.

2
00:00:11,428 --> 00:00:12,451
Speaker 0: I'm Brim.

3
00:00:12,531 --> 00:00:12,992
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,112 --> 00:00:14,315
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,355 --> 00:00:19,900
Speaker 1: Tonight, we review the fantastic Night is Short Walk on Girl.

6
00:00:21,823 --> 00:00:22,859
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

7
00:00:23,660 --> 00:00:28,014
Speaker 1: So I've been actually training myself to do faster half marathons.

8
00:00:28,034 --> 00:00:36,487
Speaker 1: Like I've realized that I can't run short distances as fast as I used to because 35 and 25.

9
00:00:36,487 --> 00:00:38,313
Speaker 1: And that kind of training is kind of hard on me.

10
00:00:38,373 --> 00:00:40,480
Speaker 1: And like my 5k times are never going to get better.

11
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:49,986
Speaker 1: But old people consistently run very good marathons and half marathons and all those like like 10k and up length races.

12
00:00:50,608 --> 00:00:56,888
Speaker 1: So I've actually been training to do long runs for the last summer as opposed to what I used to do up to that point.

13
00:00:57,631 --> 00:00:58,454
Speaker 1: And it's starting to pay off.

14
00:00:58,514 --> 00:01:07,687
Speaker 1: So I can now reliably do a half marathon under two hours, even if it's hot out, even if I'm tired, even if I don't bring food, like I'm always under two hours.

15
00:01:08,068 --> 00:01:08,971
Speaker 1: So now I'm shooting for an hour 50.

16
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:20,550
Speaker 1: But more importantly, I found a pretty good route because they fix a couple of, there's a couple of spots, like all the ways I can run 15 or 14 or whatever.

17
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:28,280
Speaker 1: miles basically either require me to do a bunch of like fiddly navigation around like traffic lights or I have to go way out of my way from a bike path.

18
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:34,645
Speaker 1: Like if I run north on the east side, the bike path or the running path is broken in a couple of places for construction.

19
00:01:34,665 --> 00:01:37,757
Speaker 1: And if I run around into Queens, I got to deal with traffic.

20
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:44,085
Speaker 1: And like if I go another way, I got to ride the subway home because I'm not going to run five miles home after I run 15 miles.

21
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:48,523
Speaker 1: But I found a route that goes a loop into Manhattan and back up through Brooklyn into Queens.

22
00:01:48,864 --> 00:01:52,337
Speaker 1: That's almost exactly a half marathon if I make one tweak to it.

23
00:01:52,397 --> 00:01:54,928
Speaker 0: Why don't you just run to a park and then run in a circle and then run home?

24
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:55,731
Speaker 1: Because that sucks.

25
00:01:56,896 --> 00:01:58,864
Speaker 1: I like to cover new novel ground.

26
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:00,269
Speaker 1: Otherwise, running's boring as shit.

27
00:02:00,831 --> 00:02:01,695
Speaker 1: See, also biking.

28
00:02:02,016 --> 00:02:05,429
Speaker 1: You want to just you want to just bike to Central Park and go around it all day and nothing else.

29
00:02:07,817 --> 00:02:09,907
Speaker 0: Are you enjoying the biking or are you enjoying the seeing stuff?

30
00:02:10,309 --> 00:02:10,490
Speaker 0: Both.

31
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:12,742
Speaker 0: If you're enjoying the seeing stuff, you could just ride a car.

32
00:02:13,324 --> 00:02:13,886
Speaker 1: No, it's both.

33
00:02:13,926 --> 00:02:18,180
Speaker 1: It's traversing distances with different scenery over time.

34
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:25,801
Speaker 0: Get a Google Maps VR biking hookup where you just bike in place and then you see new stuff on your VR.

35
00:02:26,002 --> 00:02:30,755
Speaker 1: No, that's not nearly as fun because you're just on rollers.

36
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:32,379
Speaker 1: You're not really biking.

37
00:02:32,419 --> 00:02:33,767
Speaker 0: Put a fan in front of you so you don't even know.

38
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,316
Speaker 1: No, you're still just on rollers.

39
00:02:35,558 --> 00:02:41,399
Speaker 1: I mean, yes, if biking in New York or in the world constituted a perfectly flat level, unchanging distance.

40
00:02:41,419 --> 00:02:48,889
Speaker 0: No, they have one, the trainers that like get harder, that match up with the video and they get harder and easier as the video has hills or downhills in it.

41
00:02:50,153 --> 00:02:52,521
Speaker 1: That's still not, that's still just not, like.

42
00:02:52,581 --> 00:02:53,384
Speaker 1: it's not a terrain.

43
00:02:53,445 --> 00:02:54,027
Speaker 1: It's just flat.

44
00:02:54,067 --> 00:02:55,171
Speaker 1: It's still perfectly flat.

45
00:02:56,216 --> 00:02:56,999
Speaker 1: There's no bumps.

46
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,646
Speaker 0: I guess, I guess it can't bump you.

47
00:02:58,968 --> 00:02:59,972
Speaker 1: I would like it to bump me.

48
00:03:00,334 --> 00:03:01,037
Speaker 0: You want to get bumped?

49
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:05,619
Speaker 1: Actually, what I'm really going to try now is that a mountain biking course up in sprain.

50
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:06,682
Speaker 1: Now that I figured out where it is.

51
00:03:07,445 --> 00:03:09,711
Speaker 0: So maybe there's one in Queens.

52
00:03:10,052 --> 00:03:12,138
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's not good.

53
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:12,720
Speaker 1: I looked into it.

54
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:17,597
Speaker 1: The good one near New York is near the sprain brook highway and like up in the Bronx.

55
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:18,923
Speaker 1: That's the place to go.

56
00:03:18,943 --> 00:03:23,303
Speaker 0: It's being a biking, uh, because of tariffs bikes in the U S are about to get expensive.

57
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:29,455
Speaker 0: So if you want, and it's already the right time to buy a bike cause it's fall, which was when new bike models come out and last year's bikes are cheap.

58
00:03:29,817 --> 00:03:32,529
Speaker 0: So if you want to buy a bike, you got about a month to buy a bike.

59
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:37,855
Speaker 0: And after that, it's not going to be a great time to buy a bike unless you buy like a used one, which then it won't matter.

60
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:40,885
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's only going to be like a 20% price increase significant.

61
00:03:40,926 --> 00:03:48,227
Speaker 0: It turns your $500 bike into a $600 bike or your $5,000 bike into a $1,200 bike.

62
00:03:48,588 --> 00:03:49,491
Speaker 0: That is a lot of money.

63
00:03:49,511 --> 00:03:54,809
Speaker 0: Well, unless you're buying $100 bike, then it becomes $120 bike, which is not a big deal.

64
00:03:55,091 --> 00:03:55,311
Speaker 1: Yup.

65
00:03:55,853 --> 00:04:02,061
Speaker 1: The other thing would be if you're like, I'm going to buy some parts that I'm going to need in the near future sooner rather than later.

66
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:11,596
Speaker 1: The other, the problem is even buying them now, I think the price increases are going to come well ahead of the tariffs actually affecting the supply line by like today.

67
00:04:11,857 --> 00:04:12,338
Speaker 1: Yeah.

68
00:04:12,378 --> 00:04:17,959
Speaker 1: This week, the moral is if you voted for Trump, you fucked up and now bikes are more expensive.

69
00:04:17,978 --> 00:04:20,892
Speaker 1: Unless you hate bikes and then you're still a bad person.

70
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:25,549
Speaker 0: Either way, you think people who voted for Trump like bikes?

71
00:04:25,589 --> 00:04:27,133
Speaker 0: You ever seen a cyclist or the red hat?

72
00:04:27,274 --> 00:04:30,825
Speaker 1: They're in fact the literal opposite of the kind of person who would like a bike.

73
00:04:31,869 --> 00:04:35,982
Speaker 0: I feel like anyone who rides bikes is guaranteed not to be right-wing.

74
00:04:37,085 --> 00:04:38,709
Speaker 0: You ever seen a right-wing bike person?

75
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:39,632
Speaker 1: I don't know.

76
00:04:39,652 --> 00:04:51,319
Speaker 1: I imagine if I found a right-wing bike person, they either have one of those cheating things that lets it look like you're on a real bike, but it's actually an electric motor or they just stole the bike.

77
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:59,710
Speaker 1: So anyway, we got a ton of geek bites because we've been watching a bunch of stuff and we've not been watching the same stuff.

78
00:05:00,373 --> 00:05:01,558
Speaker 1: In fact, I think almost nothing.

79
00:05:01,578 --> 00:05:06,437
Speaker 1: we're watching overlaps except Tonegawa's middle management whatever and Walk on Girl.

80
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,040
Speaker 1: the Night is Short.

81
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,848
Speaker 0: I think I'm done watching Tonegawa.

82
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:15,351
Speaker 1: I watched two more episodes and I like it, but I feel like I got to watch Akagi before.

83
00:05:15,411 --> 00:05:16,815
Speaker 1: I could truly appreciate it.

84
00:05:17,216 --> 00:05:21,211
Speaker 1: And also as much as I like it, it's not as good as a lot of the other things I'm watching.

85
00:05:22,455 --> 00:05:24,724
Speaker 1: So what do you have to say about Hanabado?

86
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:25,747
Speaker 0: Oh, so...

87
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:28,558
Speaker 1: Because we talked about this in Judge Anime, right?

88
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:28,818
Speaker 0: Right.

89
00:05:28,839 --> 00:05:35,822
Speaker 0: So when we judged anime, there was a badminton show and I feel like what we said was like, "Oh, it's a sports anime.

90
00:05:36,224 --> 00:05:41,482
Speaker 0: It'll probably be just like all the other sports animes like Yo-Yo Peddle and Haikyuu, but only badminton this

91
00:05:41,522 --> 00:05:41,803
Speaker 0: time.".

92
00:05:42,465 --> 00:05:49,502
Speaker 0: So I watched one episode of the badminton show and the badminton show is not good.

93
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:52,309
Speaker 1: Like, what's bad about it?

94
00:05:52,409 --> 00:05:53,292
Speaker 1: I'm just curious.

95
00:05:53,452 --> 00:05:59,752
Speaker 0: So the first of all, it doesn't have any of the comedy or excitement that other sports anime have.

96
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:00,917
Speaker 0: It is super serious.

97
00:06:01,218 --> 00:06:02,101
Speaker 1: Which could be good.

98
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,046
Speaker 1: I was like, they're super serious, like touch.

99
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:04,929
Speaker 0: Sure.

100
00:06:05,911 --> 00:06:15,888
Speaker 0: But it has a little bit of the things that Yuri on Ice has, which is at the very start, it shows two people and one of them loses to the other person at badminton.

101
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,540
Speaker 0: And then for some reason, they're both at the same school.

102
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:26,853
Speaker 0: One of them is in the badminton club, the one who lost, and is all angry at the world and, you know, is mean to all the other badminton club people.

103
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:28,040
Speaker 0: So the club is going to fall apart.

104
00:06:28,541 --> 00:06:35,610
Speaker 0: And the other person, the person who won and scored all the points and destroyed the angry person, isn't even playing badminton.

105
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:37,560
Speaker 0: They're playing tennis and they're like a genius.

106
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:41,455
Speaker 0: They're just like, you know, but they don't even want to, right?

107
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:44,687
Speaker 1: Well, to be fair, tennis is way more fun than badminton.

108
00:06:44,727 --> 00:06:48,359
Speaker 0: They're the reluctant, you know, prodigy person.

109
00:06:48,821 --> 00:06:49,524
Speaker 1: Okay.

110
00:06:49,544 --> 00:06:53,760
Speaker 0: They're all shy and don't want to say anything and don't even want to play badminton.

111
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,726
Speaker 0: Like it's almost like Shinji, right?

112
00:06:56,971 --> 00:07:01,569
Speaker 0: But basically none of these characters have any character or likable in any way.

113
00:07:02,072 --> 00:07:03,960
Speaker 0: It's like there's no character you give a shit about.

114
00:07:04,402 --> 00:07:06,611
Speaker 0: And everyone's taking everything way too serious.

115
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:09,422
Speaker 0: Like they're crying about badminton club within episode one.

116
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:24,428
Speaker 0: And then the only character that has any life to them whatsoever is the mysterious person who's clearly some sort of coach who reminds me a lot of the bad perverted coach from the horse show.

117
00:07:24,448 --> 00:07:25,852
Speaker 1: Oh, that's not good news.

118
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,780
Speaker 0: Only there was only one scene of perversion so far.

119
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:34,418
Speaker 0: And then it's like, we've introduced here, this person's going to help the badminton.

120
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:39,867
Speaker 0: It's not, no, unless it's not good.

121
00:07:39,887 --> 00:07:40,488
Speaker 0: All right.

122
00:07:40,609 --> 00:07:42,172
Speaker 1: I will refrain from watching it.

123
00:07:42,232 --> 00:07:42,713
Speaker 1: I forget.

124
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:49,813
Speaker 0: I like, but nope, there's no character in here.

125
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,684
Speaker 1: What's funny is I already forget what we said about this show.

126
00:07:52,724 --> 00:07:54,555
Speaker 1: So I don't actually know if we said pretty sure.

127
00:07:54,595 --> 00:08:00,386
Speaker 0: I thought it was going to be just like all the other sports anime, only badminton, but no, it's worse than all the other sports anime, only badminton.

128
00:08:00,487 --> 00:08:00,667
Speaker 1: Yup.

129
00:08:01,049 --> 00:08:05,686
Speaker 1: So I watched the first episode of the dragon prince, which is actually really, really good.

130
00:08:06,387 --> 00:08:07,851
Speaker 1: So it's on Netflix.

131
00:08:08,172 --> 00:08:10,518
Speaker 1: It's a high fantasy drama.

132
00:08:10,819 --> 00:08:12,686
Speaker 1: The vague gist of it is so it's like slayers.

133
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,920
Speaker 1: So it's kind of, but serious, like a hundred percent serious.

134
00:08:16,782 --> 00:08:22,428
Speaker 1: It's written by this or at least partially written by the same head writer as avatar, the last airbender, which you also haven't seen.

135
00:08:22,729 --> 00:08:24,215
Speaker 1: And which is also fantastic.

136
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:31,877
Speaker 1: Like if I had to rate it on our old anime scale, avatar is an a anime, a minus at worse.

137
00:08:31,917 --> 00:08:34,905
Speaker 1: Like it's up there with the a shows that we talk about.

138
00:08:35,448 --> 00:08:52,222
Speaker 1: This is basically avatar to not set in that world, like nothing to do with avatar, except that it has a lot of the, a lot of similar tropes, similar writing, similar characters, but it's a high fantasy world where basically elves and humans, like all these different kinds of elves and humans and dragons all live in this fantasy world.

139
00:08:53,185 --> 00:08:53,948
Speaker 0: No dwarves.

140
00:08:54,008 --> 00:08:55,352
Speaker 1: That's fine though.

141
00:08:55,373 --> 00:08:58,623
Speaker 1: Cause there's multiple kinds of elves and there's super hot dragons.

142
00:08:59,526 --> 00:09:05,425
Speaker 1: So at some point there's still like, there's six kinds of magic in the world and there's this whole fantasy thing.

143
00:09:05,906 --> 00:09:11,909
Speaker 1: But then the humans discover the seventh kind of magic, which is basically evil bullshit.

144
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,732
Speaker 0: Yeah.

145
00:09:13,154 --> 00:09:15,823
Speaker 1: And they use it and they're like, yeah, we got evil bullshit.

146
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:19,795
Speaker 1: And the elves are like, ah, fuck, no, get the fuck off our Island.

147
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,002
Speaker 0: Check out my evil bullshit.

148
00:09:22,102 --> 00:09:23,046
Speaker 0: All the elves dead.

149
00:09:23,488 --> 00:09:23,729
Speaker 0: So the

150
00:09:23,809 --> 00:09:35,433
Speaker 1: elves and the dragons just for, well, the elves at least force all the humans to the other side of the continent, put a big wall between the two of them and the king of the dragons, who's just this giant bad-ass fucking dragon

151
00:09:35,453 --> 00:09:37,200
Speaker 0: president of the United States.

152
00:09:37,861 --> 00:09:42,157
Speaker 1: The dragon basically just says, I'll guard the wall between you two sides.

153
00:09:42,197 --> 00:09:42,940
Speaker 1: You never fight again.

154
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:47,529
Speaker 1: And the humans use the dark sides.

155
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:48,311
Speaker 0: King of dragons.

156
00:09:48,872 --> 00:09:49,073
Speaker 1: Yeah.

157
00:09:49,113 --> 00:09:55,328
Speaker 1: So the humans go use the dark magic to kill the king of the dragons.

158
00:09:55,489 --> 00:09:57,554
Speaker 1: And now war is about to begin.

159
00:09:57,574 --> 00:09:58,797
Speaker 1: Yeah.

160
00:09:59,298 --> 00:10:04,235
Speaker 1: And the show is, it's a kid's show like Avatar, but Avatar is super good.

161
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:05,660
Speaker 1: And this is also super good.

162
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:10,113
Speaker 0: I wanted to see the evil magic be all like evil and like bloodbath.

163
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:12,400
Speaker 1: Avatar is a bloodbath.

164
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,309
Speaker 1: Do you know how many people die in Avatar?

165
00:10:14,329 --> 00:10:14,851
Speaker 0: No, no, no.

166
00:10:14,871 --> 00:10:21,439
Speaker 0: Like, like, like, you know, violence, like, you know, like berserk or it's like, uh, we'll see how far, how close it goes to that.

167
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,324
Speaker 1: Cause it's on Netflix.

168
00:10:22,444 --> 00:10:24,092
Speaker 0: Like the Netflix Castlevania anime.

169
00:10:24,252 --> 00:10:27,206
Speaker 1: Well, there is more of that coming, which I'm really looking forward to.

170
00:10:27,729 --> 00:10:30,202
Speaker 1: The only problem with it, like the character designs are great.

171
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:31,890
Speaker 1: The voice acting is fantastic.

172
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:33,357
Speaker 1: The story is pretty good so far.

173
00:10:33,397 --> 00:10:34,000
Speaker 1: The writing is good.

174
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:42,535
Speaker 1: The only complaint, and Emily pointed this out because I couldn't articulate it that well, is a lot of people were saying the frame rate is bad on the animation.

175
00:10:42,997 --> 00:10:43,880
Speaker 1: Remember like walk through.

176
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,247
Speaker 0: Wouldn't it be 30 FPS being?

177
00:10:46,388 --> 00:10:48,875
Speaker 1: it's not that the show is 30 FPS.

178
00:10:49,256 --> 00:10:51,243
Speaker 1: It's that the characters look kind of jittery.

179
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:57,548
Speaker 0: Like when they move like stuttery, it almost looks like, is it animated on like the fours or the sixes or who knows?

180
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:07,325
Speaker 1: It almost looks like if you took a 24 frame a second cinematic and just put it on a modern television, but only the characters, not like the backgrounds or anything else.

181
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:09,838
Speaker 0: It's not that just the way they rendered it.

182
00:11:09,938 --> 00:11:21,405
Speaker 1: And the, it's the way that what Emily said, cause she knows way more about this than we do is what appears to be happening is they wanted it to look hand drawn instead of a CG cause it's CG and it looks pretty kind of like walk through.

183
00:11:21,425 --> 00:11:23,961
Speaker 1: It looked great when it was still, but it looked a little weird when it moved.

184
00:11:24,323 --> 00:11:27,594
Speaker 1: So in this case, she said that the characters don't ease.

185
00:11:27,654 --> 00:11:28,396
Speaker 1: They never ease.

186
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,230
Speaker 1: And I didn't, I, now I realize what that means.

187
00:11:31,511 --> 00:11:41,491
Speaker 1: You know, when someone like strikes a pose and then they settle like a little bit, like after they struck the pose, that's easing and this show does not have that animation.

188
00:11:41,532 --> 00:11:53,383
Speaker 1: characters strike a pose and then they're static, but it stops being distracting after one episode and the show is so good that I'm just going to watch anything else.

189
00:11:53,544 --> 00:11:56,996
Speaker 0: So I watched an episode of yellow guy, yeah.

190
00:11:57,196 --> 00:12:00,351
Speaker 0: Assassination classroom, which is an anime I'd heard of many times.

191
00:12:00,371 --> 00:12:01,296
Speaker 0: I don't know how old it is.

192
00:12:01,437 --> 00:12:02,864
Speaker 0: It has a lot more episodes than I thought.

193
00:12:02,924 --> 00:12:04,370
Speaker 1: I've never watched it.

194
00:12:04,430 --> 00:12:05,616
Speaker 1: And all I know about it.

195
00:12:05,656 --> 00:12:08,185
Speaker 1: All I know is that it's the yellow guy, the yellow guy.

196
00:12:08,245 --> 00:12:11,013
Speaker 1: And it's one of those anime premise.

197
00:12:11,154 --> 00:12:12,979
Speaker 1: There are rules shows.

198
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,205
Speaker 1: It's in the genre of.

199
00:12:14,486 --> 00:12:15,309
Speaker 1: there are rules.

200
00:12:15,370 --> 00:12:16,374
Speaker 0: Are you ready for the premise?

201
00:12:16,555 --> 00:12:16,856
Speaker 0: All right.

202
00:12:16,876 --> 00:12:20,373
Speaker 0: This is not spoilers because it's all in episode one, which is the only episode I've seen.

203
00:12:20,393 --> 00:12:20,815
Speaker 0: You ready?

204
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:23,306
Speaker 0: Here's the premise of assassination classroom.

205
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:28,465
Speaker 0: Everyone on earth looked up at the moon and holy shit, like the moon exploded.

206
00:12:28,485 --> 00:12:35,331
Speaker 0: It's now permanently a crescent moon because a giant hole was blown and it explode because everyone looked up at it at the same time.

207
00:12:35,492 --> 00:12:38,183
Speaker 0: No, you couldn't notice the moon not exploded.

208
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:40,211
Speaker 0: It was a giant explosion.

209
00:12:40,392 --> 00:12:43,544
Speaker 1: The way you phrase that everyone looked up and the moon exploded.

210
00:12:43,685 --> 00:12:45,731
Speaker 1: So the moon exploded and everyone looked up.

211
00:12:46,052 --> 00:12:48,340
Speaker 0: Anyway, the moon exploded, right?

212
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:54,040
Speaker 0: The government found out this explosion on the moon that destroyed it was caused by yellow guy.

213
00:12:54,621 --> 00:12:54,942
Speaker 0: All right.

214
00:12:55,123 --> 00:12:55,343
Speaker 0: Right.

215
00:12:56,046 --> 00:12:59,136
Speaker 0: Yellow guy is ridiculously powerful.

216
00:12:59,156 --> 00:13:00,280
Speaker 0: You don't really know his origins.

217
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,485
Speaker 0: He can travel at mach 20.

218
00:13:02,485 --> 00:13:07,360
Speaker 1: So like cuba or what's his name from the show where all the kids die.

219
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:07,963
Speaker 1: He's yellow.

220
00:13:08,003 --> 00:13:08,707
Speaker 0: He has tentacles.

221
00:13:08,747 --> 00:13:09,692
Speaker 0: He can change color.

222
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:11,140
Speaker 0: Who knows what other powers he has.

223
00:13:11,641 --> 00:13:12,924
Speaker 0: He's from the earth.

224
00:13:13,124 --> 00:13:14,547
Speaker 0: He says he's not an alien.

225
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:24,233
Speaker 0: Uh, and he speaks English, even though his mouth doesn't move when he speaks English, but he has a mouth.

226
00:13:24,314 --> 00:13:25,398
Speaker 1: It just smiles all the time.

227
00:13:25,579 --> 00:13:31,702
Speaker 0: And he basically has threatened the earth that he will destroy the earth after I think a year or some amount of time.

228
00:13:31,742 --> 00:13:32,544
Speaker 0: I think something like a year.

229
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:39,950
Speaker 0: And the only way that he will not do to the earth, what he did to the moon is if someone, someone kills him.

230
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:40,492
Speaker 0: Yes.

231
00:13:40,532 --> 00:13:41,135
Speaker 0: He has to be killed.

232
00:13:41,255 --> 00:13:48,215
Speaker 0: He has demanded that he be allowed to teach this class of students how to kill him.

233
00:13:48,235 --> 00:13:54,319
Speaker 0: Uh, and so he's teaching this class of students, which is like, and it's, it's like the delinquent class, like class E.

234
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:56,024
Speaker 1: All right.

235
00:13:56,205 --> 00:13:56,967
Speaker 1: All right.

236
00:13:57,088 --> 00:14:00,760
Speaker 0: And they're in this school that is like, you know, an abandoned school.

237
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,864
Speaker 0: So no one else is there really.

238
00:14:02,286 --> 00:14:13,543
Speaker 0: So these students perfectly normal, but low grade students, have to go to this class in the school that's in the woods and he's their teacher and the yellow guy is their teacher.

239
00:14:13,904 --> 00:14:15,570
Speaker 0: He teaches them perfectly normally.

240
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:19,805
Speaker 0: Uh, he doesn't, you know, he's perfectly good, excellent teacher.

241
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:22,273
Speaker 0: And, but they're trying to kill him.

242
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:30,126
Speaker 0: If they kill anyone who successfully kills him, will not only save the earth, but will be paid like a zillion, bajillion dollars by the government.

243
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:36,589
Speaker 0: And the government has provided them with all manner of deadly weapons that are deadly only to yellow guy and not to them.

244
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:46,328
Speaker 0: So like they have guns that shoot these little balls and they try to shoot him and they like, he's, he's taking attendance and they're all blasting at him nonstop with assault rifles and Uzi's.

245
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:51,788
Speaker 0: and like for the whole time he's taking attendance, he's moving around to mock 20, dodging everything.

246
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:59,020
Speaker 0: And then they're like, you know, oh, we don't believe that, you know, someone questions whether the bullets even actually work.

247
00:14:59,341 --> 00:15:02,294
Speaker 0: So the yellow guy shoots his own arm with one and his arm explodes.

248
00:15:02,897 --> 00:15:03,058
Speaker 0: Right.

249
00:15:03,078 --> 00:15:04,283
Speaker 0: And he's like, no, they totally work.

250
00:15:04,564 --> 00:15:05,447
Speaker 0: You guys just couldn't hit me.

251
00:15:05,467 --> 00:15:06,793
Speaker 0: I was gonna mock 20.

252
00:15:06,793 --> 00:15:11,129
Speaker 0: He goes, he, he flies at mock 20 to get Mavo tofu for lunch from China.

253
00:15:11,591 --> 00:15:13,799
Speaker 1: Ooh, I would do that if I could do that.

254
00:15:13,819 --> 00:15:14,321
Speaker 0: I'm just saying.

255
00:15:14,341 --> 00:15:18,474
Speaker 0: Uh, so it has this comedic aspect, but also this scenario aspect.

256
00:15:19,216 --> 00:15:22,993
Speaker 0: And the thing is on the one hand, it's like, I could watch all of this, right?

257
00:15:23,033 --> 00:15:27,275
Speaker 0: And like, you know, I guess you would learn the characters of the different students and other thing.

258
00:15:27,335 --> 00:15:29,565
Speaker 0: And I, I assume there's this sort of conflict between.

259
00:15:29,585 --> 00:15:30,891
Speaker 0: he's a good teacher.

260
00:15:30,991 --> 00:15:31,835
Speaker 0: What's his deal?

261
00:15:31,915 --> 00:15:33,522
Speaker 0: But we have to kill him to save the earth.

262
00:15:33,783 --> 00:15:34,767
Speaker 0: Who knows what's going on?

263
00:15:34,787 --> 00:15:36,975
Speaker 0: because you see moments where he's evil too.

264
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:37,336
Speaker 0: Right.

265
00:15:38,059 --> 00:15:43,422
Speaker 0: Uh, but I feel like there's the kind of show where I just want to go right to the end and skip all the middle part.

266
00:15:43,542 --> 00:15:44,948
Speaker 0: And I just want to know what the deal is.

267
00:15:44,988 --> 00:15:45,670
Speaker 1: Read a spoiler.

268
00:15:45,771 --> 00:15:46,032
Speaker 0: I will.

269
00:15:46,534 --> 00:15:46,895
Speaker 1: Okay.

270
00:15:46,915 --> 00:15:52,177
Speaker 0: That's what I'm going to do because I don't want to watch 47 episodes or whatever it is.

271
00:15:52,337 --> 00:15:59,927
Speaker 1: That's how I dealt with my desire to know what happens in the attack on Titan while having zero interest in watching any more attack on Titan.

272
00:16:00,128 --> 00:16:06,515
Speaker 0: I feel like it could be fun, but I feel like it's just, it's like, it's just a little bit too shallow and transparent to actually be worth my time.

273
00:16:07,178 --> 00:16:09,306
Speaker 0: So I should just go right to the end and be done with it.

274
00:16:09,527 --> 00:16:12,499
Speaker 0: I feel like I would watch this, but watching it's not bad.

275
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:17,243
Speaker 1: I, you know, I feel like I would watch this if I didn't have so many other great shows to watch right now.

276
00:16:17,504 --> 00:16:17,705
Speaker 0: Yeah.

277
00:16:17,786 --> 00:16:20,137
Speaker 0: It's like, I feel like it's just below the line of something.

278
00:16:20,439 --> 00:16:24,720
Speaker 0: It's like, you could watch it and he'd be cool with that, but it's just below the line where I need to watch it.

279
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,129
Speaker 0: I can just, you know, go see what the answer is.

280
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:29,297
Speaker 0: So I also kill him.

281
00:16:29,317 --> 00:16:30,019
Speaker 0: Do they not kill him?

282
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,884
Speaker 0: Does he destroy the earth?

283
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:35,188
Speaker 1: So I know, I think I've mentioned this a couple of times, but because it's Wednesday, I can sort of formally do it.

284
00:16:35,529 --> 00:16:36,273
Speaker 1: Adventure time's done.

285
00:16:36,293 --> 00:16:36,694
Speaker 1: Of course.

286
00:16:36,715 --> 00:16:38,483
Speaker 0: The ending is now done.

287
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,614
Speaker 0: We can know what, instead of us saying, Oh, it's ending soon.

288
00:16:40,754 --> 00:16:41,217
Speaker 0: It is over.

289
00:16:41,317 --> 00:16:46,656
Speaker 0: Like there will never be another tele official television episode of adventure time on Cartoon Network.

290
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:54,983
Speaker 1: You cannot know more about the Canon of this cartoon than me because I have seen is going to literally every second of.

291
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:58,697
Speaker 1: it is going to be a movie that does not impact the Canon in any way.

292
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,626
Speaker 0: And there are comic books, which I own many of.

293
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:01,410
Speaker 1: They're fantastic.

294
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,053
Speaker 1: The comic books.

295
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:02,335
Speaker 1: Yes.

296
00:17:02,576 --> 00:17:03,601
Speaker 1: Kind of like the pony comic books.

297
00:17:03,621 --> 00:17:05,165
Speaker 1: Those are just like a plus comics.

298
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:05,387
Speaker 0: Yep.

299
00:17:05,888 --> 00:17:06,952
Speaker 0: But I own all those too.

300
00:17:07,554 --> 00:17:09,582
Speaker 0: I own all the adventure done comics.

301
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:10,244
Speaker 0: I own a lot of them.

302
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:11,771
Speaker 1: My gig bite of adventure time.

303
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:15,790
Speaker 1: Now that I know the fullness of it is that it is one of the greatest cartoons ever made.

304
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:19,144
Speaker 1: I think it will, that was already true, but it'll stand the test of time.

305
00:17:19,164 --> 00:17:23,096
Speaker 1: Uh, and it ended literally perfectly.

306
00:17:23,136 --> 00:17:25,746
Speaker 1: That ending is so utterly perfect.

307
00:17:25,906 --> 00:17:28,396
Speaker 0: Is my man choose goose in the final episode?

308
00:17:28,435 --> 00:17:29,541
Speaker 1: The voice actor of choose goose.

309
00:17:29,561 --> 00:17:30,945
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure is in the dragon Prince.

310
00:17:31,928 --> 00:17:32,249
Speaker 0: Okay.

311
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:34,516
Speaker 1: There's a character who comes out.

312
00:17:34,717 --> 00:17:55,812
Speaker 0: I told her in this earlier, I learned today, today I learned this, that the voice actor of choose goose the best character, but also the voice actor of a zillion other things, including candle Jack from freak is what, you know, I'm going to need more rope.

313
00:17:55,872 --> 00:17:58,726
Speaker 0: If you don't have a candle Jack is I'm going to need more rope.

314
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:02,825
Speaker 1: If you don't know what freak is all it is almost say is that it was weirdly ahead of its time.

315
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:06,919
Speaker 0: You can put that out today and people would think it was made today.

316
00:18:08,901 --> 00:18:11,111
Speaker 0: If it was an HD, do yourself a favor.

317
00:18:11,512 --> 00:18:21,840
Speaker 1: If you're not caught up on adventure time, don't just go watch the end because it literally sort of needs you to have seen every single episode of the show.

318
00:18:22,482 --> 00:18:23,887
Speaker 0: All the, all the episodes that matter.

319
00:18:23,927 --> 00:18:25,633
Speaker 0: There's no episodes.

320
00:18:25,653 --> 00:18:32,640
Speaker 1: I would say you need to have seen every episode of the show for it's a really, even the Masaki was a weird food chain episode.

321
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:33,421
Speaker 1: Yes.

322
00:18:33,662 --> 00:18:35,646
Speaker 1: Actually specifically.

323
00:18:35,686 --> 00:18:37,490
Speaker 1: Yes.

324
00:18:37,510 --> 00:18:39,214
Speaker 1: I ain't even shitting you bro.

325
00:18:40,337 --> 00:18:45,173
Speaker 0: It is even the, or even like that early episode where, um, where, uh, what's his name?

326
00:18:45,193 --> 00:18:46,619
Speaker 0: was the voice for the heart guy.

327
00:18:47,381 --> 00:18:48,064
Speaker 1: Oh, Ricardo.

328
00:18:48,325 --> 00:18:48,687
Speaker 0: Yeah.

329
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:53,003
Speaker 1: Uh, I think you would need to see that because it does set up some things about why bubblegum does what she does.

330
00:18:55,450 --> 00:18:55,590
Speaker 1: It's.

331
00:18:56,533 --> 00:18:59,140
Speaker 0: you'll see even the episode with the horse on the ball.

332
00:18:59,782 --> 00:19:04,520
Speaker 1: All I'm going to say is that remember that the Lynch said that he is the last scholar of golf.

333
00:19:05,441 --> 00:19:06,847
Speaker 1: The show ends perfectly.

334
00:19:06,867 --> 00:19:08,814
Speaker 1: And I cry every time I watch.

335
00:19:08,855 --> 00:19:10,160
Speaker 0: the ending ends with golf.

336
00:19:11,061 --> 00:19:11,844
Speaker 1: Uh, there's a golf.

337
00:19:12,004 --> 00:19:13,930
Speaker 0: golf is involved related to glob.

338
00:19:14,292 --> 00:19:14,853
Speaker 1: Possibly.

339
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:15,495
Speaker 0: Possibly.

340
00:19:16,258 --> 00:19:18,965
Speaker 1: It's very secretive spacey.

341
00:19:19,005 --> 00:19:21,238
Speaker 1: Like the, like it's, it, it kind of frames everything nicely.

342
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:22,042
Speaker 1: That's my favorite part.

343
00:19:22,565 --> 00:19:34,049
Speaker 1: Give me that Prisma boy, but it frames everything nicely and wraps things up appropriately for both the literal reality of the show and all of the themes that have recurred in the show over its run.

344
00:19:34,069 --> 00:19:35,778
Speaker 0: Give me that Prisma and that cosmic owl.

345
00:19:35,898 --> 00:19:40,775
Speaker 1: There's a, the last time you see Prisma is an excellent moment.

346
00:19:40,816 --> 00:19:45,659
Speaker 1: I would say that every character, the last frame that they're on screen is a masterpiece by itself.

347
00:19:48,281 --> 00:19:48,542
Speaker 1: So yeah.

348
00:19:49,023 --> 00:19:53,857
Speaker 1: Uh, the other thing that I'm watching right now is a BoJack season five.

349
00:19:54,379 --> 00:19:55,583
Speaker 1: It's continuing to be excellent.

350
00:19:55,623 --> 00:19:59,339
Speaker 1: It's still some of the best like animation for adults that's out there.

351
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:04,276
Speaker 1: And season five is already better than a lot of the previous seasons.

352
00:20:04,356 --> 00:20:07,567
Speaker 1: And it hasn't even gotten to quote unquote the good part yet.

353
00:20:09,011 --> 00:20:12,845
Speaker 1: And of course, DuckTales, which I also watched all of and is fantastic and you should watch it.

354
00:20:13,568 --> 00:20:19,849
Speaker 1: And I'm actually really looking forward to season two, which apparently starts in March.

355
00:20:20,932 --> 00:20:22,897
Speaker 1: No, it was renewed in March this year.

356
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:27,293
Speaker 1: And the second season will premiere in God, late 2018.

357
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:27,916
Speaker 1: I got to wait a while.

358
00:20:27,936 --> 00:20:28,619
Speaker 0: We've got time for this.

359
00:20:29,001 --> 00:20:30,426
Speaker 1: There's only 23 episodes.

360
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:47,071
Speaker 1: I found that once I watched one, I just had to watch them all because the show just every episode is better than the previous episode and the episode where it makes a crossover with the gummy bears is pretty good, but not quite as good as the episode that crosses over kind of with My Little Pony.

361
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:47,894
Speaker 0: Here's the news.

362
00:20:48,416 --> 00:20:49,560
Speaker 0: Care Bears is coming back.

363
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:51,362
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

364
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:52,726
Speaker 0: It looks pretty cute.

365
00:20:53,047 --> 00:20:54,110
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm not watching it.

366
00:20:56,577 --> 00:21:02,605
Speaker 0: I'm conflicted on that because what I was saying is I'm not telling you to watch the new Care Bears because I don't even know when it's coming out or I don't care.

367
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,031
Speaker 0: But do look.

368
00:21:04,332 --> 00:21:06,642
Speaker 0: There's like one promotional image floating around.

369
00:21:06,662 --> 00:21:08,753
Speaker 0: Look at that image to see what the Care Bears look like.

370
00:21:09,115 --> 00:21:09,738
Speaker 0: They look pretty good.

371
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:14,379
Speaker 1: Well, we're in this weird golden age of like bringing this stuff back.

372
00:21:14,921 --> 00:21:16,127
Speaker 0: Yeah, because no one's got any new ideas.

373
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:17,936
Speaker 1: Not people have plenty of new ideas.

374
00:21:17,976 --> 00:21:18,580
Speaker 1: BoJack's new.

375
00:21:20,561 --> 00:21:22,186
Speaker 1: I guess unless you saw Californication.

376
00:21:24,693 --> 00:21:28,283
Speaker 1: So there is some actual news that isn't just us talking about shows we've watched recently.

377
00:21:29,425 --> 00:21:34,015
Speaker 1: Space Jam 2 is coming with LeBron.

378
00:21:34,376 --> 00:21:34,917
Speaker 0: Oh, baby.

379
00:21:35,859 --> 00:21:38,343
Speaker 1: I'm weirdly excited for this.

380
00:21:38,684 --> 00:21:41,531
Speaker 0: Let's go theater.

381
00:21:41,551 --> 00:21:45,700
Speaker 1: I look forward to the slam and I want to come to the jam.

382
00:21:48,545 --> 00:21:54,386
Speaker 1: See, the thing is, I suspect that the original movie does not hold up at all, but I have not.

383
00:21:54,587 --> 00:21:56,576
Speaker 1: I get this feeling it's not going to hold up.

384
00:21:56,837 --> 00:21:57,560
Speaker 0: Oh, you don't think so.

385
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:57,981
Speaker 1: I don't.

386
00:21:58,001 --> 00:21:58,664
Speaker 1: We should watch it.

387
00:21:58,945 --> 00:22:00,613
Speaker 1: We've never reviewed it on Geek Nights.

388
00:22:01,115 --> 00:22:09,946
Speaker 0: See, I think the thing with Space Jam is that it was it was merely okay to good to begin with, but I think it is still holds up as okay to good.

389
00:22:09,986 --> 00:22:10,930
Speaker 0: I don't think it is decreased.

390
00:22:11,352 --> 00:22:12,476
Speaker 1: I could see that.

391
00:22:12,697 --> 00:22:13,922
Speaker 1: I remember being okay to good.

392
00:22:13,943 --> 00:22:17,718
Speaker 0: Thing is, is that it loses its novelty to Space Jam's coming back.

393
00:22:17,818 --> 00:22:20,988
Speaker 0: They need to bring back the Quad City DJs, a.k.a.

394
00:22:20,988 --> 00:22:25,280
Speaker 0: 95 South with the Miami booty for the theme song.

395
00:22:28,106 --> 00:22:28,327
Speaker 0: Right.

396
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,193
Speaker 0: Otherwise, it's no go.

397
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:31,477
Speaker 0: Streets of Rage is coming back.

398
00:22:31,517 --> 00:22:32,280
Speaker 0: They're remaking that.

399
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:38,424
Speaker 0: If they don't have music by the same person who made the music, I forget his name, we saw him at MAGFest.

400
00:22:38,464 --> 00:22:38,885
Speaker 0: Yeah, we did.

401
00:22:38,905 --> 00:22:41,154
Speaker 0: Who made the music for Streets of Rage?

402
00:22:41,415 --> 00:22:44,326
Speaker 0: one and two and three, then there's no point.

403
00:22:44,968 --> 00:22:48,183
Speaker 0: No matter how good the game is, it's like, no, the music is what made it happen.

404
00:22:48,665 --> 00:22:48,926
Speaker 0: Right.

405
00:22:49,468 --> 00:22:53,043
Speaker 0: It'd be like if you made a Miyazaki movie and you didn't have some Joe Hisaishi music.

406
00:22:53,084 --> 00:22:54,651
Speaker 0: It's like, just get out of my face with that.

407
00:22:54,933 --> 00:22:58,971
Speaker 1: Like if you made more utenna and didn't put that J like Shazar music in it.

408
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:00,458
Speaker 0: It's like Initial D without Eurobeat.

409
00:23:00,498 --> 00:23:00,960
Speaker 0: It's worthless.

410
00:23:01,661 --> 00:23:01,822
Speaker 0: Yeah.

411
00:23:01,842 --> 00:23:02,625
Speaker 1: Literally worthless.

412
00:23:02,665 --> 00:23:03,268
Speaker 1: Initial D.

413
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:07,124
Speaker 0: If this Space Jam movie has some Miami booty, we're good to go.

414
00:23:07,145 --> 00:23:08,993
Speaker 1: Then we know exactly.

415
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:10,138
Speaker 1: I'm weirdly excited about this.

416
00:23:10,158 --> 00:23:10,681
Speaker 1: I don't know what to do.

417
00:23:10,701 --> 00:23:11,947
Speaker 0: What could the plot possibly be?

418
00:23:12,007 --> 00:23:13,012
Speaker 0: Monsters come again.

419
00:23:13,032 --> 00:23:14,981
Speaker 0: And they're like, Michael Jordan's old.

420
00:23:15,021 --> 00:23:15,784
Speaker 0: We can beat you now.

421
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:17,109
Speaker 0: It's like, no, we made a LeBron.

422
00:23:17,952 --> 00:23:21,846
Speaker 1: That is literally the plot I would have pitched like that.

423
00:23:21,946 --> 00:23:22,548
Speaker 1: Exactly.

424
00:23:22,588 --> 00:23:24,033
Speaker 1: With a cameo and everything.

425
00:23:24,474 --> 00:23:26,501
Speaker 1: That is the exact plot I would put in.

426
00:23:26,521 --> 00:23:33,906
Speaker 0: The only other problem is that I think that kids these days did not grow up with Looney Tunes as much as we did.

427
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:36,599
Speaker 0: I'm sure they still know those characters, but not as much as we do.

428
00:23:37,081 --> 00:23:42,900
Speaker 0: I think what you should do is make it with other characters, perhaps Cartoon Network characters.

429
00:23:43,241 --> 00:23:44,246
Speaker 1: You know what actually would work?

430
00:23:44,306 --> 00:23:45,431
Speaker 0: Or anime characters.

431
00:23:45,772 --> 00:23:54,550
Speaker 1: If you could somehow pull together Roger Rabbit style characters from a bunch of different things because there were those new like Mickey Mouse cartoons that are really good.

432
00:23:54,591 --> 00:24:01,216
Speaker 0: Here's the problem, though, is that original Space Jam worked because the Looney Tunes characters are clearly not athletic.

433
00:24:01,236 --> 00:24:05,111
Speaker 0: Other than Bugs Bunny, who has natural skill at everything.

434
00:24:05,131 --> 00:24:07,020
Speaker 1: Like what's Elmer Fudd gonna do?

435
00:24:07,361 --> 00:24:08,424
Speaker 0: Exactly right.

436
00:24:09,467 --> 00:24:14,583
Speaker 0: But the characters that kids are into these days, it's like, but fucking Jake the dog.

437
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:19,020
Speaker 0: Jake the dog doesn't need the bronze help as long as he learns to play basketball.

438
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:19,762
Speaker 0: Right.

439
00:24:19,942 --> 00:24:20,645
Speaker 0: You're good to go.

440
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:24,320
Speaker 0: You know, it's like, well, you know, Naruto, Naruto can jam.

441
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:26,385
Speaker 0: Don't need no LeBron.

442
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:28,033
Speaker 0: Largo can probably beat LeBron.

443
00:24:28,515 --> 00:24:29,500
Speaker 0: LeBron is going to be on the bench.

444
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:34,066
Speaker 1: If you got Naruto on your team, it's just going to be a bunch of Fortnite's and that's it like Fortnite's and LeBron.

445
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:36,497
Speaker 0: I don't know if Fortnite's is stronger or weaker than LeBron.

446
00:24:36,698 --> 00:24:39,150
Speaker 1: Gumball could work because those characters are not athletic.

447
00:24:39,170 --> 00:24:40,355
Speaker 1: The point is, right.

448
00:24:40,516 --> 00:24:42,888
Speaker 0: LeBron can't out basketball Captain America.

449
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:44,657
Speaker 1: I feel like this could be used instead.

450
00:24:44,677 --> 00:24:48,953
Speaker 1: Here's a counterpoint to catapult and bring back a big Looney Tunes era.

451
00:24:49,315 --> 00:24:49,776
Speaker 0: Go for it.

452
00:24:49,797 --> 00:24:51,343
Speaker 1: Because Looney Tunes could work in the modern era.

453
00:24:51,363 --> 00:24:54,360
Speaker 1: Those new Mickey Mouse cartoons, like all that stuff were really good.

454
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,603
Speaker 0: I think we need to.

455
00:24:55,945 --> 00:25:06,241
Speaker 0: you know, the thing is, if I was writing it right, the way I write this shit is I'd be like, yo, you know, we still don't need the LeBron if I let Cody just bomb the other teams and himself.

456
00:25:12,165 --> 00:25:15,208
Speaker 1: But anyway, things of the day.

457
00:25:15,528 --> 00:25:19,374
Speaker 1: So I have a thing of the day that's really good and interesting, but depressing.

458
00:25:19,394 --> 00:25:20,277
Speaker 1: So I figured I'd save it.

459
00:25:20,598 --> 00:25:26,896
Speaker 1: So instead, this is just a dog feeding carrots to three rabbits and a pig.

460
00:25:26,916 --> 00:25:28,901
Speaker 0: I don't.

461
00:25:29,683 --> 00:25:34,216
Speaker 1: it is literally that this is not a Mustang hits bike bicyclist.

462
00:25:34,517 --> 00:25:41,210
Speaker 0: Did you see that it was a gift going around with his three dogs and they try to give a treat to the dog in the middle and he pushes the treat to the dog on the left.

463
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:41,731
Speaker 1: Yeah.

464
00:25:41,751 --> 00:25:46,258
Speaker 0: And then another treat comes in and he pushes the treat to the dog in the right and helps his friend does because he's a good dog.

465
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:52,145
Speaker 1: I also saw the one where the guy gives the treat to the first dog and then he gives the treat to the second dog.

466
00:25:52,165 --> 00:25:57,548
Speaker 1: But the first dog grabs and runs away and the second dog just looks up like, what the fuck is also a good one going around.

467
00:25:57,568 --> 00:26:01,425
Speaker 0: I think I see multiples that follow this formula where they were first.

468
00:26:01,465 --> 00:26:05,744
Speaker 0: There were videos people did where they would play like the, you know, the treat in the three cup shell game.

469
00:26:06,307 --> 00:26:07,391
Speaker 0: And the pet would get right.

470
00:26:07,692 --> 00:26:07,973
Speaker 1: Yeah.

471
00:26:08,395 --> 00:26:09,780
Speaker 1: Oh, the one where the pet got it wrong.

472
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:12,730
Speaker 0: No, they do it where they have three cups.

473
00:26:13,151 --> 00:26:13,312
Speaker 0: Right.

474
00:26:13,332 --> 00:26:14,818
Speaker 0: They put the treat under one of the cups.

475
00:26:14,878 --> 00:26:15,842
Speaker 0: They play the shell game.

476
00:26:16,204 --> 00:26:20,019
Speaker 0: The pet takes the shell with the or the cup or the bowl with the treat in it.

477
00:26:20,461 --> 00:26:21,183
Speaker 0: It's one treat.

478
00:26:21,645 --> 00:26:27,412
Speaker 0: And then the owner opens up another bowl that was previously had just been I think I saw there's a little white dog that looks like one.

479
00:26:27,713 --> 00:26:29,320
Speaker 0: And there was a ton of treats in that.

480
00:26:30,223 --> 00:26:30,785
Speaker 0: And then.

481
00:26:30,886 --> 00:26:31,167
Speaker 0: Right.

482
00:26:31,327 --> 00:26:33,316
Speaker 0: And that's that's a funny a lot of these.

483
00:26:33,356 --> 00:26:37,113
Speaker 1: They always there's this one song that was used in Rick and Morty and they cut to that song.

484
00:26:37,234 --> 00:26:38,561
Speaker 1: usually when they make these memes.

485
00:26:38,581 --> 00:26:42,562
Speaker 0: Like imagine if I play the shell game with rim, but instead, you know, you don't start with all the shells open.

486
00:26:42,623 --> 00:26:43,890
Speaker 0: You only open the one shell.

487
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,426
Speaker 0: And then you reveal the one I didn't pick is like I put like a dollar under it.

488
00:26:47,446 --> 00:26:48,532
Speaker 0: I shuffle them all around.

489
00:26:48,552 --> 00:26:49,879
Speaker 0: And then the other one had a gold bar.

490
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,211
Speaker 1: Now the other one's got like an unreleased Advance Wars.

491
00:26:54,416 --> 00:26:55,298
Speaker 0: So it's code to advance.

492
00:26:55,318 --> 00:26:58,264
Speaker 1: So what do you have for me?

493
00:26:58,986 --> 00:27:06,807
Speaker 0: So I don't know if I feel like I've done this thing of the day before, but for almost 20 years, we have loved the radical.

494
00:27:07,028 --> 00:27:13,351
Speaker 0: The fact that we never got a canonical published conclusion, I think, wasn't in the book that we didn't get couldn't get.

495
00:27:13,572 --> 00:27:14,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, but we didn't.

496
00:27:14,415 --> 00:27:16,984
Speaker 1: we didn't get to see it animated speculation.

497
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:22,926
Speaker 0: So the creator of Radisco is a guy named Joe Sparks, who has an Elvis Presley style haircut and still does.

498
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:27,563
Speaker 0: And Joe Sparks, after finishing Radisco and going to get jobs at places.

499
00:27:28,667 --> 00:27:33,282
Speaker 0: And I guess those jobs prevented him from making more Radisco in some way.

500
00:27:33,402 --> 00:27:35,129
Speaker 1: There's a whole complicated story.

501
00:27:35,169 --> 00:27:37,557
Speaker 1: There's a situation why he couldn't make more Radisco.

502
00:27:37,717 --> 00:27:44,719
Speaker 0: Anyway, the point is, is that he disappeared to go work as an adult for years and years and years.

503
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:52,665
Speaker 0: And only recently, maybe less than two years ago, returned to YouTube and has been producing content of various sorts.

504
00:27:52,726 --> 00:27:54,391
Speaker 1: In fact, he has a note on this video.

505
00:27:54,431 --> 00:27:56,177
Speaker 1: you link to a quote.

506
00:27:56,699 --> 00:28:00,752
Speaker 1: I am searching for those millions of Radisco and Devil Devil doll fans from 2001.

507
00:28:00,752 --> 00:28:04,527
Speaker 1: That is, if you know one, please let them know about my YouTube channel.

508
00:28:04,808 --> 00:28:05,170
Speaker 0: I'm here.

509
00:28:05,711 --> 00:28:06,172
Speaker 1: Yeah.

510
00:28:06,854 --> 00:28:08,318
Speaker 1: Joe, we got your back.

511
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,982
Speaker 1: We're like the O.G.

512
00:28:10,043 --> 00:28:11,186
Speaker 1: fans of Radisco.

513
00:28:11,226 --> 00:28:11,647
Speaker 0: We are.

514
00:28:12,349 --> 00:28:17,628
Speaker 0: But anyway, the point is, is I think I've talked about his return to YouTube before.

515
00:28:17,668 --> 00:28:18,693
Speaker 0: It may have been a previous thing.

516
00:28:18,713 --> 00:28:20,643
Speaker 1: He's still only got like a thousand subscribers.

517
00:28:20,724 --> 00:28:20,884
Speaker 1: Yeah.

518
00:28:20,925 --> 00:28:27,433
Speaker 0: This may have been a previous thing of the day, you know, his channel or some video on his channel, but he just put out a new video on his channel.

519
00:28:27,875 --> 00:28:36,343
Speaker 0: And in this video, what's going on is he was at one time an employee at LeapFrog, who I believe made children's fake computers.

520
00:28:37,005 --> 00:28:38,169
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, that sounds right.

521
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:48,587
Speaker 0: And I believe he was some sort of game developer software maker there making games for children's tiny computers for maybe at some portion of his life in between making Radisco and now.

522
00:28:49,088 --> 00:28:55,752
Speaker 0: And while he was there, that company had a talent show and he was in the talent show performing Radisco songs live.

523
00:28:55,812 --> 00:29:00,705
Speaker 0: It seems like he just told the entire story of all episodes of Radisco.

524
00:29:01,227 --> 00:29:06,042
Speaker 0: And this is a video that was of that performance at that talent show that was rescued.

525
00:29:06,062 --> 00:29:12,586
Speaker 0: And he put it on YouTube and is well worth watching because I have never seen a live performance of Radisco before.

526
00:29:12,606 --> 00:29:17,101
Speaker 0: And also, wow, he just makes the Radisco and Deviled all voices.

527
00:29:17,142 --> 00:29:20,292
Speaker 1: Yeah, that he can do that way more naturally.

528
00:29:20,452 --> 00:29:22,758
Speaker 0: They required no audio production.

529
00:29:22,778 --> 00:29:25,064
Speaker 0: He is just a good voice actor.

530
00:29:25,084 --> 00:29:31,664
Speaker 1: I feel like the pro movie for Netflix to pick up and reboot Radisco and Deviled.

531
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:35,660
Speaker 0: Also, he changes kill to kiss because I think he's talking to children.

532
00:29:36,162 --> 00:29:37,629
Speaker 0: He's performing in front of many children.

533
00:29:37,649 --> 00:29:40,400
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I think it was bring your kid to work day.

534
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:43,974
Speaker 0: Well, because one company where they make children's toys.

535
00:29:44,134 --> 00:29:51,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, also there's a so Adventure Time has a lot of moments where Finn or Jake or someone will say the words, I'll kill you.

536
00:29:52,261 --> 00:29:55,112
Speaker 1: And in the UK, at least, I don't think this has changed.

537
00:29:55,373 --> 00:29:56,860
Speaker 1: They won't let that be in a kid's shows.

538
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,496
Speaker 1: They usually remove it, kind of like how you can't spit on anyone.

539
00:30:00,516 --> 00:30:04,054
Speaker 1: That's why they cut out all the scenes in Adventure Time where someone spits on someone.

540
00:30:04,094 --> 00:30:08,572
Speaker 0: Well, that's why in the Ninja Turtles live action movie, which is excellent and holds up.

541
00:30:08,913 --> 00:30:15,534
Speaker 0: The Foot Clan is like teenagers and bad people in the Teenage Ninja Turtles cartoon that ran on TV for many years.

542
00:30:15,956 --> 00:30:21,357
Speaker 0: All of the foot soldiers are robots that explode the same as they are on the Teenage Ninja Turtles arcade machine.

543
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:22,502
Speaker 0: Yeah, et cetera.

544
00:30:22,623 --> 00:30:26,363
Speaker 1: There's there's a. there is a joke about that in Rick and Morty that you would not appreciate.

545
00:30:26,383 --> 00:30:28,334
Speaker 1: So I'll just skip it because you haven't seen that show.

546
00:30:28,374 --> 00:30:31,106
Speaker 1: But it's relevant to your turtles analogy.

547
00:30:31,126 --> 00:30:33,863
Speaker 0: They fight a bunch of guys that robots and then fight a real guy and he believes that.

548
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:34,367
Speaker 1: So they're fighting.

549
00:30:34,387 --> 00:30:37,243
Speaker 1: So they're fighting a bunch of guys and the kids like, I don't want to hurt anyone.

550
00:30:37,283 --> 00:30:38,449
Speaker 1: And he's like, shoot him.

551
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:39,875
Speaker 1: They're just robots.

552
00:30:39,996 --> 00:30:40,277
Speaker 1: Kill him.

553
00:30:40,297 --> 00:30:41,020
Speaker 1: They're just robots.

554
00:30:41,241 --> 00:30:41,984
Speaker 1: They're not shooting them.

555
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:42,486
Speaker 0: They're not.

556
00:30:42,687 --> 00:30:44,593
Speaker 1: They're clearly not robots.

557
00:30:44,934 --> 00:30:46,499
Speaker 1: And he's like, they're not robots.

558
00:30:46,579 --> 00:30:47,101
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

559
00:30:47,502 --> 00:30:51,434
Speaker 1: And then Rick is just like, yeah, but I mean, they're like robots.

560
00:30:51,514 --> 00:30:52,538
Speaker 1: I just I don't respect them.

561
00:30:54,405 --> 00:30:56,814
Speaker 0: Before we start the show, I just want to say it's hockey time.

562
00:30:57,697 --> 00:30:58,078
Speaker 1: Oh, it is.

563
00:30:58,098 --> 00:31:00,967
Speaker 1: I even watched the fake hockey preseason.

564
00:31:01,007 --> 00:31:03,216
Speaker 1: No, it was a pretty good game because it went into OT.

565
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:04,421
Speaker 0: I'm sure he was, but no.

566
00:31:04,442 --> 00:31:05,567
Speaker 1: And the OT was pretty good.

567
00:31:05,587 --> 00:31:16,811
Speaker 1: But very briefly, in the meta moment, if you are here because you saw us at PAX, if you go to our website, there is video of the panel we gave not from PAX West, but when we did it at PAX East, because guess what?

568
00:31:16,831 --> 00:31:21,730
Speaker 1: We did the same panel twice and the entire list is available in that YouTube video.

569
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:28,755
Speaker 1: Also, the Book Club book is still Homer's Odyssey, apparently, because Scott has an update at the 2001 Space Odyssey.

570
00:31:29,257 --> 00:31:31,504
Speaker 0: We're just going to do all Odysseys called the Odyssey Club.

571
00:31:32,367 --> 00:31:39,988
Speaker 1: And you may know that over a year ago, I started a Civilization V multiplayer game with the Patreon.

572
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:44,325
Speaker 1: patrons of Geek Knights, like people who are in the Patreon had the chance to join this game.

573
00:31:44,346 --> 00:31:45,310
Speaker 1: It was all humans.

574
00:31:45,730 --> 00:31:48,116
Speaker 1: We played this giant civilization five game.

575
00:31:48,818 --> 00:31:53,090
Speaker 1: The game actually just finished like the game is done.

576
00:31:53,391 --> 00:31:58,304
Speaker 1: We've been playing Civ V by mail for a long goddamn time.

577
00:31:58,725 --> 00:32:06,170
Speaker 1: The game is over, and I am now uploading the series of videos showing the progression of the game in the world over time.

578
00:32:06,631 --> 00:32:07,855
Speaker 1: So you can watch all that on YouTube.

579
00:32:07,875 --> 00:32:15,824
Speaker 1: I just uploaded a video where I titled it "The Raising of Susa" because if you couldn't guess, I burned fucking Susa to the ground.

580
00:32:15,844 --> 00:32:18,412
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, Craig Oliver.

581
00:32:20,217 --> 00:32:21,761
Speaker 1: Rule one of multiplayer Civ.

582
00:32:22,403 --> 00:32:25,812
Speaker 1: Building the great library sends a message to everyone around you.

583
00:32:25,852 --> 00:32:29,307
Speaker 1: And that message is I have built this instead of building an army.

584
00:32:29,528 --> 00:32:29,930
Speaker 0: That's right.

585
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:31,353
Speaker 0: I built this for you.

586
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:36,088
Speaker 0: Please accept my gift of one great library.

587
00:32:36,128 --> 00:32:37,593
Speaker 1: Do you have spear men and catapults?

588
00:32:37,633 --> 00:32:40,344
Speaker 1: Well, there is a party here and you're all invited.

589
00:32:40,485 --> 00:32:47,210
Speaker 1: So we've actually talked about a bunch of Masaki Yuasa movies in recent memory because Masaki Yuasa is really productive lately.

590
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,596
Speaker 1: Yeah, and really good.

591
00:32:49,696 --> 00:32:54,932
Speaker 1: And if I had to describe Masaki Yuasa in terms of like the kinds of works I expect.

592
00:32:56,457 --> 00:33:00,510
Speaker 1: Off the wall, kind of weird, little spacey, like that's kind of the way where I'd put it.

593
00:33:01,392 --> 00:33:04,980
Speaker 1: And night is short, walk on girl does not disappoint.

594
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:08,989
Speaker 0: So, yeah, so hold on.

595
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:17,302
Speaker 0: I'm trying to bring something up, which is an interesting thing that I learned only at the end of this movie, when after the credits, Masaki Yuasa comes out to speak.

596
00:33:18,025 --> 00:33:18,887
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, yeah.

597
00:33:18,908 --> 00:33:19,249
Speaker 0: All right.

598
00:33:19,269 --> 00:33:20,432
Speaker 0: So this is what I learned, right?

599
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:23,681
Speaker 0: So there is a person whose name is Tomohiko Morimi.

600
00:33:24,403 --> 00:33:28,954
Speaker 0: Tomohiko Morimi is an author, right?

601
00:33:28,974 --> 00:33:33,124
Speaker 0: And they are the author of Eccentric Family.

602
00:33:33,304 --> 00:33:43,681
Speaker 0: Eccentric Family, Tatami Galaxy, Night is Short, Walk on Girl, something called Penguin Highway that's probably amazing, Adventures of a Saintly Slacker, which sounds amazing.

603
00:33:44,203 --> 00:33:47,274
Speaker 0: And 2016, something called Night Train, which sounds amazing.

604
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,988
Speaker 0: Basically, everything they've written sounds amazing.

605
00:33:51,008 --> 00:33:57,068
Speaker 0: And the things, my only experience of their work, their novels are the anime adaptations, right?

606
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:10,650
Speaker 0: So Eccentric Family was not animated by Masaki Yuasa, but Tatami Galaxy and Night is Short, Walk on Girl were both written by the same author, the original novels and animated by the same people.

607
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:17,134
Speaker 1: And there seems to be a trend that at least these things are linked in subtle ways in the anime adaptations.

608
00:34:17,214 --> 00:34:17,395
Speaker 1: Right.

609
00:34:17,415 --> 00:34:25,306
Speaker 0: So, Rim, see, after seeing that thing after the credits, I said, "Well, I feel like I'm not going to be able to do a show on this.

610
00:34:25,485 --> 00:34:27,877
Speaker 0: Night is Short, Walk on Girl, unless I've seen at least some Tatami

611
00:34:27,897 --> 00:34:28,259
Speaker 0: Galaxy.".

612
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:28,762
Speaker 0: So I went home.

613
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:31,273
Speaker 0: I've seen now two episodes of Tatami Galaxy.

614
00:34:31,373 --> 00:34:32,638
Speaker 1: And I do plan to watch it all.

615
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:37,577
Speaker 0: In Tatami Galaxy, within the first minute, I see that Tengu Chin guy.

616
00:34:37,938 --> 00:34:40,888
Speaker 0: Literally, that character is just right there at the start, right?

617
00:34:41,149 --> 00:34:49,496
Speaker 0: The main two characters of Night is Short, Walk on Girl are Crook, slightly so, but are also the main two characters of Tatami Galaxy.

618
00:34:49,918 --> 00:34:56,156
Speaker 0: The minor character in Night is Short, Walk on Girl, the demon in the book.

619
00:34:56,196 --> 00:34:58,402
Speaker 1: The used book, God.

620
00:34:58,442 --> 00:35:04,801
Speaker 0: Yes, a crook, a little bit more than slightly version of that character, is a very main character of Tatami Galaxy.

621
00:35:05,764 --> 00:35:08,272
Speaker 0: The art style is basically identical.

622
00:35:08,693 --> 00:35:10,877
Speaker 0: The mood is very similar.

623
00:35:11,298 --> 00:35:14,365
Speaker 0: The plot is not so similar.

624
00:35:15,046 --> 00:35:16,530
Speaker 0: They're not redundant.

625
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:18,927
Speaker 0: Just, you know, you think, "Oh, that was only the same character, just the same

626
00:35:18,967 --> 00:35:19,149
Speaker 0: thing.".

627
00:35:19,209 --> 00:35:20,555
Speaker 0: No, it's not the same thing at all.

628
00:35:21,157 --> 00:35:22,844
Speaker 0: They're two separate works.

629
00:35:23,064 --> 00:35:25,653
Speaker 0: They're originally two separate novels, right?

630
00:35:26,335 --> 00:35:39,352
Speaker 0: It's just that because the same animation team was adapting two works from the same author that have some similarities, they kept some character designs and some moods and some things.

631
00:35:40,436 --> 00:35:46,955
Speaker 0: But from two episodes, I can already tell that Tatami Galaxy is fantastic, but we're not renewing Tatami Galaxy.

632
00:35:47,296 --> 00:35:59,271
Speaker 0: I'm just letting you know that I feel like it's hard to fully review one of these things without knowing about the other because there's so much togetherness going on here.

633
00:35:59,311 --> 00:36:08,776
Speaker 1: But at the same time, I cannot stress enough, The Night is Short, Walk on Girl is 100% watchable in a vacuum.

634
00:36:08,836 --> 00:36:10,945
Speaker 0: Yes, either one of these things stands alone.

635
00:36:11,186 --> 00:36:16,446
Speaker 0: If you were to watch them independently, but to fully grok either one, I think you need to experience both.

636
00:36:16,967 --> 00:36:21,241
Speaker 1: So I would actually recommend just go see this movie.

637
00:36:21,683 --> 00:36:23,709
Speaker 0: I don't think it matters which one you see first.

638
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:27,143
Speaker 1: No, I mean, just like stop listening to gig nights right now and just go see this movie.

639
00:36:27,183 --> 00:36:27,505
Speaker 0: That would.

640
00:36:28,951 --> 00:36:32,946
Speaker 1: this movie is one of the better anime movies I've seen in a long time.

641
00:36:33,067 --> 00:36:37,561
Speaker 1: I went into it knowing literally nothing about it except who directed it.

642
00:36:37,621 --> 00:36:47,196
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think it's even better than the other Yuasa one we saw with the vampire dog, but that might be because the vampire one, Lou Over the Wall.

643
00:36:47,276 --> 00:36:48,885
Speaker 0: I think it's better than Lou Over the Wall.

644
00:36:48,905 --> 00:36:52,542
Speaker 0: Maybe that's just because Lou Over the Wall is more of a children's movie and I'm an adult.

645
00:36:52,803 --> 00:36:56,255
Speaker 0: If this is not a children's movie, it begins with people getting blasted.

646
00:36:56,436 --> 00:36:56,696
Speaker 0: Yup.

647
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:08,793
Speaker 1: It's hard to describe what this movie is about without either really spoiling it or getting really, really sort of philosophical because it is very philosophical.

648
00:37:08,813 --> 00:37:18,073
Speaker 1: The plot is expansive in scope and covers probably 500% more ground than you expect it to.

649
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:26,220
Speaker 0: Basically, the way to summarize it best is that this is girl and it's one night in her life that we're experiencing.

650
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:26,380
Speaker 0: Yup.

651
00:37:26,541 --> 00:37:29,653
Speaker 1: She's on the cusp of becoming an adult or friends getting married.

652
00:37:30,094 --> 00:37:37,293
Speaker 0: The night begins at this wedding that she's attending and she goes on after the wedding.

653
00:37:38,176 --> 00:37:43,935
Speaker 0: She goes out to drink and starts partying and the night becomes this big adventure, right?

654
00:37:44,536 --> 00:37:50,415
Speaker 1: But in that like time-dilated way that nights like that when you're young feel like they last a lifetime.

655
00:37:50,475 --> 00:37:54,669
Speaker 0: Right, so in this night there are four seasons, right?

656
00:37:54,709 --> 00:38:01,335
Speaker 0: And I think he said the book was divided into four seasons and they sort of compressed the four seasons into one night in the movie.

657
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:03,023
Speaker 0: I haven't read the book.

658
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:04,007
Speaker 0: Obviously, it's Japanese.

659
00:38:04,028 --> 00:38:06,597
Speaker 0: I don't think it's translated.

660
00:38:06,637 --> 00:38:09,146
Speaker 0: I think it might be be getting translated though.

661
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:13,046
Speaker 0: I think I did read something somewhere that they're working on publishing these novels in English.

662
00:38:13,066 --> 00:38:13,650
Speaker 0: I would read them.

663
00:38:13,951 --> 00:38:17,800
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would read them, but the four seasons, right?

664
00:38:17,921 --> 00:38:21,932
Speaker 0: It sort of starts and I think it's starting.

665
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:24,323
Speaker 0: It starts in spring because it ends in winter, right?

666
00:38:24,665 --> 00:38:29,243
Speaker 0: So that's the, you know, that wedding part and that the parties soon after that are the spring.

667
00:38:29,705 --> 00:38:31,412
Speaker 0: Then there's this summer part and thank you.

668
00:38:31,633 --> 00:38:33,300
Speaker 0: Everything gets hot, right?

669
00:38:33,481 --> 00:38:36,573
Speaker 0: There's an ice kotatsu because they're all melting, right?

670
00:38:36,613 --> 00:38:39,385
Speaker 0: They go to the night book fair like, you know, the cicadas.

671
00:38:39,445 --> 00:38:40,349
Speaker 0: It's really right.

672
00:38:40,369 --> 00:38:50,171
Speaker 0: The hot times then there's then this fall and there starts to be stuff happening at the school and people are getting cold, but I guess and then at the end it's winter and everyone's sick, right?

673
00:38:50,934 --> 00:39:00,102
Speaker 0: And that's sort of the flow of this this one epic long adventurous night that goes through these four seasons and crazy stuff happens.

674
00:39:00,142 --> 00:39:17,906
Speaker 1: And if I really had to try to explain what it's about on a high level like it's it's that feeling when you're young and you haven't really decided what you want to do yet in your life and you're sort of you're just entering the adult world and you're starting to do the things that adults do and everything feels very important.

675
00:39:18,488 --> 00:39:31,397
Speaker 1: Very minor things feel like they're the most important things in the world and it follows someone through like experiencing a night like that like those nights we used to have when we were young like at RIT wandering around at night fighting with sticks and whatever.

676
00:39:31,417 --> 00:39:49,132
Speaker 1: But it also, but it simultaneously has this long-running theme about how the exact same night is very different even for the people who had the exact same experience based on their state of mind and how they feel about the situation.

677
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:56,760
Speaker 1: Like multiple people have the same experience and they all see it completely differently because of the state of their own heart and mind.

678
00:39:57,423 --> 00:40:00,054
Speaker 1: And you see this illustrated in so many different ways.

679
00:40:00,074 --> 00:40:06,318
Speaker 1: it'd be hard to catalog them like the clocks literally are moving faster for the old people than for the young people.

680
00:40:06,899 --> 00:40:16,149
Speaker 1: Things like that like the school festival which I can only describe as Kill La Kill like that festival like bunker where they're running it.

681
00:40:17,052 --> 00:40:27,990
Speaker 1: it evokes how it felt to be running the RIT anime club back when I was in college compared to now as an adult the reality of what running the RIT anime club was really like.

682
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:29,836
Speaker 0: Right so not you know.

683
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:33,248
Speaker 0: the main character is the the girl right who has like.

684
00:40:33,268 --> 00:40:36,424
Speaker 0: we keep saying the girl like she has no name it's just the girl it's literally the girl.

685
00:40:36,444 --> 00:40:40,057
Speaker 1: there's the girl the guy there the characters the other characters.

686
00:40:40,098 --> 00:40:41,322
Speaker 0: some of them have names right.

687
00:40:41,383 --> 00:40:49,073
Speaker 1: so she's just walking on she's just going from moment to moment the world's sort of passing her by and she's interacting with things for the hell of it.

688
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:49,415
Speaker 1: these

689
00:40:49,636 --> 00:40:57,150
Speaker 0: other characters though all have threads right and it's like everyone's thread gets resolved at some point usually tied up with some other character

690
00:40:57,391 --> 00:41:05,910
Speaker 1: and she's sort of almost a catalyst like as she's passing through the world everyone else's stories keep merging with hers and then splitting off again and then merging with each other.

691
00:41:06,111 --> 00:41:15,550
Speaker 0: yeah it's like this there's a character who's like in the beginning right and like the very opening scene the the guy who doesn't change his underwear and then katsu and then he goes away.

692
00:41:16,072 --> 00:41:20,990
Speaker 0: you don't see him for a while and then later on he comes back and he's real important.

693
00:41:21,391 --> 00:41:36,749
Speaker 0: yeah right uh the only other character besides girl who is sort of there the whole time is guy who is sort of in love with her from afar and keeps chasing her and keeps getting caught in the wake of her adventures but not really catching up to her and it you know coincidentally he

694
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:41,526
Speaker 1: feels a little bit like a scojo person like in terms of the way scojo

695
00:41:41,546 --> 00:41:43,673
Speaker 0: that doesn't mean anything to anyone who's listening

696
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:44,275
Speaker 1: a friend of ours.

697
00:41:44,376 --> 00:42:02,962
Speaker 1: i guess a lot of the characters in this evoke not the details of the lives of our own friends but the feeling about those people when they were similarly young and having these experiences like being young and running the anime club and being young and pining after a girl that you know like it's.

698
00:42:03,524 --> 00:42:10,183
Speaker 1: it's all those feelings and encapsulates what it felt like to be 19 and full of vim and vinegar and gin.

699
00:42:10,203 --> 00:42:19,434
Speaker 1: right also there is a lot of flowing this entire hemming away and the girl's superpower is that she can drink an infinite amount of alcohol.

700
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:22,409
Speaker 0: there's a very important drinking contest and she just keeps going.

701
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:25,306
Speaker 0: yep uh there's a lot of eating and a lot of food.

702
00:42:25,346 --> 00:42:30,400
Speaker 0: there's a scene where oh the hot nabe which is literally like lava nabe.

703
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:36,315
Speaker 0: uh you know this and you know at the same time that you've got sort of this.

704
00:42:36,756 --> 00:42:40,330
Speaker 0: you know serious philosophical thing and these character threads.

705
00:42:40,851 --> 00:42:48,535
Speaker 0: it is wacky and kuku bananas right in terms of like the you know in a masaki yuasa way and it just keeps going.

706
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:57,566
Speaker 1: it just keeps moving like it never pauses the only like the masaki yuasa episodes of uh adventure time adventure time or what was the space dandy?

707
00:42:57,726 --> 00:43:00,134
Speaker 0: yeah it's it's wacky like those.

708
00:43:00,174 --> 00:43:02,983
Speaker 1: very often they're like there's.

709
00:43:03,083 --> 00:43:06,997
Speaker 1: so we could if we did a final thoughts episode where we talked about the details of this movie.

710
00:43:07,038 --> 00:43:08,182
Speaker 1: it could go on for hours.

711
00:43:08,664 --> 00:43:09,508
Speaker 1: but what?

712
00:43:09,628 --> 00:43:14,230
Speaker 1: the other thing does that reminds me there's an america there's a movie a live action movie called punch drunk love.

713
00:43:14,711 --> 00:43:18,021
Speaker 1: that actually does the same thing at least for a portion of its run.

714
00:43:18,904 --> 00:43:20,589
Speaker 1: it never pauses like.

715
00:43:20,649 --> 00:43:22,174
Speaker 1: it never gives you a break.

716
00:43:22,515 --> 00:43:25,966
Speaker 1: it never like pauses to reset or like to establish.

717
00:43:25,986 --> 00:43:33,154
Speaker 1: it just keeps going and going and going and going and going as fast as possible covering so much more ground than you possibly expect and then it ends.

718
00:43:33,315 --> 00:43:40,834
Speaker 0: yeah the pace of this is really really fast and i at the start of the wasn't really cat.

719
00:43:41,376 --> 00:43:43,103
Speaker 0: i felt like i was missing something right.

720
00:43:43,364 --> 00:43:44,650
Speaker 0: but no i wasn't missing anything.

721
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:49,145
Speaker 0: it's just it was going fast and only giving me the minimum of what i needed to know.

722
00:43:49,165 --> 00:43:52,437
Speaker 0: and then later on you know things filled in.

723
00:43:52,517 --> 00:44:01,550
Speaker 0: things came around a second time a third time and i realized no i didn't miss anything they're just you they're just pushed it to the limit in terms of information.

724
00:44:01,711 --> 00:44:09,983
Speaker 0: they can give you right so that you can catch it all and comprehend everything but they can cram it all into the time they have in this movie before it's over.

725
00:44:10,003 --> 00:44:19,578
Speaker 1: i think my favorite moments without spoiling are like number one is actually early on when all the different drinking parties sort of converge with each other.

726
00:44:19,598 --> 00:44:24,920
Speaker 0: well i mean just when he they learn the dance from the all the sofas and then the old people fucking sofas.

727
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:25,482
Speaker 1: they go.

728
00:44:25,502 --> 00:44:28,354
Speaker 0: they end up at the sofas club where these kids are doing this weird.

729
00:44:28,916 --> 00:44:31,166
Speaker 0: they seem to be in a cult and they do the sofas dance.

730
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:36,129
