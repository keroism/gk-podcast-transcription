1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,660
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, June 5th, 2018.

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,102
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,543 --> 00:00:14,910
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:15,753 --> 00:00:17,762
Speaker 0: We just got shapes and beats.

5
00:00:18,244 --> 00:00:19,369
Speaker 0: It's just shapes and beats.

6
00:00:20,197 --> 00:00:24,510
Speaker 0: Let's do this Just that time of year.

7
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:26,300
Speaker 0: I'm biking to work again.

8
00:00:27,701 --> 00:00:28,684
Speaker 1: I'm biking everywhere.

9
00:00:28,704 --> 00:00:31,773
Speaker 0: Yep, but uh, so cuz I change jobs.

10
00:00:31,813 --> 00:00:33,638
Speaker 0: I bike to midtown like I have a really sure.

11
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:36,955
Speaker 0: it's like a 12 to 14 minute bike ride to work.

12
00:00:36,996 --> 00:00:37,680
Speaker 0: It's not that far.

13
00:00:38,403 --> 00:00:48,278
Speaker 0: I think I spend equal amounts of time on the Queensborough Bridge and not on the Queensborough Bridge But I'd never really biked around in midtown like during the day before.

14
00:00:48,338 --> 00:00:53,720
Speaker 0: like it's like Midtown only existed for me to get across to Central Park or across the way would you exactly?

15
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:01,512
Speaker 0: so I have to bike through like into the heart of midtown to get to my office and I encountered something that I've never really encountered before biking.

16
00:01:01,532 --> 00:01:05,658
Speaker 0: I encountered old people Yelling at me to slow down.

17
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:16,420
Speaker 0: All right, I have encountered in the like four times I've ridden my bike to work in midtown Four different old people who yelled at me to slow down.

18
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:19,415
Speaker 0: I was biking in the bike lane and today there were two of them.

19
00:01:19,475 --> 00:01:20,400
Speaker 0: two of them were today.

20
00:01:21,083 --> 00:01:23,960
Speaker 0: So in the second one when this old man yells at me to slow down.

21
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,713
Speaker 0: I actually stopped turn.

22
00:01:25,773 --> 00:01:26,600
Speaker 0: why would you do that?

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,833
Speaker 0: Cuz I was curious and I was like, what do you mean slow down?

24
00:01:28,853 --> 00:01:32,711
Speaker 0: and I had a Conversation with this person now, I decided would you do this?

25
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:36,885
Speaker 0: I was really curious, but if he's a crazy old man He was a crazy old man.

26
00:01:36,905 --> 00:01:45,972
Speaker 0: I know but specifically he said he seems to be Terrified of the idea that a bike will hit him.

27
00:01:45,992 --> 00:01:46,694
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

28
00:01:46,714 --> 00:01:47,818
Speaker 1: So don't go in the bike lane.

29
00:01:48,179 --> 00:02:01,419
Speaker 0: yet simultaneously, he thinks the bike lanes are Sidewalks that are for slow biking only and that if a bike is going fast It should be in the street with the cars instead of in the dedicated fast bike lane.

30
00:02:02,381 --> 00:02:09,830
Speaker 0: And he was really fucking mad that I was on a bike and that I was talking to him and I could have I could Have killed his wife and then I left.

31
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:10,919
Speaker 0: cuz he was obviously crazy.

32
00:02:12,161 --> 00:02:13,770
Speaker 1: And why did you just make him go crazy?

33
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,324
Speaker 1: if I keep talking to him till he just dies I think he would have hit me.

34
00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:19,760
Speaker 1: Oh, well, then you can call the police and crazy old man go where he belongs.

35
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:28,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I see while you there was a time you called the police on the crazy hobo and you felt bad like well Cuz that crazy hobo was crazy in a way where he just needed help.

36
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:31,403
Speaker 1: exactly if the police came and bludgeon this old man Over the head.

37
00:02:31,483 --> 00:02:32,469
Speaker 1: I wouldn't feel bad at all.

38
00:02:32,590 --> 00:02:34,200
Speaker 0: Yeah, I really have no sympathy for old.

39
00:02:34,561 --> 00:02:43,814
Speaker 0: I have no sympathy for the specific class of old people who are anti bike lane Or anyone is pretty much well, you know really knitted and uppity.

40
00:02:43,974 --> 00:02:45,560
Speaker 0: really anyone who's anti bike lane.

41
00:02:45,681 --> 00:02:48,372
Speaker 0: I got no tolerance for anyone who's anti anything.

42
00:02:48,393 --> 00:02:48,694
Speaker 1: I don't know.

43
00:02:49,035 --> 00:02:50,000
Speaker 0: I'm anti a lot of things.

44
00:02:50,261 --> 00:02:54,920
Speaker 0: Yeah about bike lanes only because there's no good reason to be against bike lanes.

45
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,752
Speaker 0: There's only bad reasons to be against bike lane.

46
00:02:56,773 --> 00:02:57,880
Speaker 1: There shouldn't be a bike lane.

47
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,360
Speaker 1: There should be a car lane and that would be none of them in Manhattan.

48
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,949
Speaker 0: Well, there shouldn't be cars in Manhattan.

49
00:03:02,969 --> 00:03:04,015
Speaker 0: The only there should be.

50
00:03:04,136 --> 00:03:11,940
Speaker 0: there should only be Professionally driven cars and eventually robot cars to drive around people who have disabilities there and for deliveries.

51
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:15,259
Speaker 0: There should be no other vehicles that are powered anywhere in Manhattan.

52
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:17,005
Speaker 1: Deliveries only at night.

53
00:03:17,206 --> 00:03:17,467
Speaker 0: Yep.

54
00:03:17,567 --> 00:03:18,712
Speaker 1: Also emergency vehicles.

55
00:03:18,813 --> 00:03:19,074
Speaker 0: Yep.

56
00:03:19,435 --> 00:03:19,737
Speaker 0: The end.

57
00:03:19,877 --> 00:03:20,078
Speaker 0: Yep.

58
00:03:20,118 --> 00:03:20,400
Speaker 0: That's it.

59
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:23,131
Speaker 1: And then it should spread slowly to the entire rest of the earth.

60
00:03:23,372 --> 00:03:25,240
Speaker 0: Yep, and we just shut down every town.

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:34,039
Speaker 0: That's too far away from things and if you live too far away from a place Well government's gonna buy your house and you get to move into an apartment or just you know.

62
00:03:35,361 --> 00:03:40,840
Speaker 0: Yeah So yeah that aside there we got some news today.

63
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:42,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

64
00:03:42,084 --> 00:03:45,936
Speaker 1: So e3 is coming soon, which means, you know, first of all e3 is still bad.

65
00:03:46,196 --> 00:03:51,439
Speaker 1: I'm surprised because years ago I remember talking about e3 was gonna die But somehow it avoided death.

66
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:57,719
Speaker 0: Okay, it's interesting cuz e3 was like for nerds who didn't know better because the Internet didn't really tell us what things were like.

67
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:01,410
Speaker 0: back Then people thought that e3 was like this mecca of gaming.

68
00:04:01,711 --> 00:04:05,059
Speaker 1: e3 is like just the bad parts of packs without without any other parts Yep.

69
00:04:05,422 --> 00:04:12,639
Speaker 0: But it took the modern internet and them letting non Developers in for everyone to realize this and I'm shocked that there's anyone who still cares about e3.

70
00:04:13,161 --> 00:04:21,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean basically e3 is all the video game companies still I don't know why go and have their major yearly press conferences there to show off their new shit.

71
00:04:21,841 --> 00:04:23,328
Speaker 1: I don't know why they don't do it somewhere else.

72
00:04:23,408 --> 00:04:28,048
Speaker 1: or just one year Nintendo just did it on their own and was like fuck E3 and I know why they didn't stick with it.

73
00:04:28,088 --> 00:04:29,715
Speaker 1: They're they're going back to e3 again.

74
00:04:29,815 --> 00:04:33,522
Speaker 1: Anyway, so What's the thing?

75
00:04:33,563 --> 00:04:37,519
Speaker 1: that's happening soon which means gonna produce a lot of good Tuesday news for us.

76
00:04:37,843 --> 00:04:45,980
Speaker 1: It's not happening now but luckily Some companies have got a little preemptive action a little teaser a little this and that to give us something to talk about.

77
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:54,025
Speaker 1: So the most notable one is the trailer for fallout 76. now is tough for me already because a to fall out of one I didn't.

78
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,300
Speaker 1: I never actually beat fallout one.

79
00:04:55,741 --> 00:05:01,297
Speaker 1: I never beat any fallout fallout - I booted up and I went for like a few screens in and that was it.

80
00:05:01,558 --> 00:05:04,469
Speaker 1: Yeah Fallout 3 I beat.

81
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,514
Speaker 1: I beat fallout 3.

82
00:05:05,514 --> 00:05:06,540
Speaker 1: Ooh, I didn't.

83
00:05:07,441 --> 00:05:13,116
Speaker 1: The thing is that was a $50 fallout 3 year edition with DLC fallout 3 new vegas.

84
00:05:13,176 --> 00:05:16,407
Speaker 1: I played I got Oh Middling bit in.

85
00:05:16,427 --> 00:05:17,671
Speaker 1: I didn't even make it to Vegas.

86
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:20,000
Speaker 1: I think I was like about to get to actual Vegas.

87
00:05:20,121 --> 00:05:21,048
Speaker 0: I just didn't care about.

88
00:05:21,068 --> 00:05:22,560
Speaker 1: him starts like in the desert.

89
00:05:23,182 --> 00:05:24,026
Speaker 0: I just didn't care.

90
00:05:24,046 --> 00:05:27,420
Speaker 0: and really what happened to me was that the you are outside.

91
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,788
Speaker 0: Fallouts were completely ruined by the mean every fallout.

92
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:31,169
Speaker 0: Yeah.

93
00:05:31,189 --> 00:05:35,239
Speaker 0: Well you are outside and it's an FPS or at least a first-person game.

94
00:05:35,801 --> 00:05:41,938
Speaker 1: Anyway, so then I didn't play fallout 4 cuz I'm waiting for to be el cheapo and it's not el cheapo yet.

95
00:05:42,159 --> 00:05:48,601
Speaker 1: Yeah But the thing is you got this fault 76 and this trailer for fallout 76 Right.

96
00:05:49,082 --> 00:05:52,272
Speaker 1: really appeals to me because the thing I like is it reveals no gameplay.

97
00:05:52,633 --> 00:05:52,874
Speaker 1: Yes.

98
00:05:53,255 --> 00:05:58,231
Speaker 1: The thing I like about fallout is the inside the vault aesthetic.

99
00:05:58,271 --> 00:06:03,074
Speaker 1: it reminds me of paranoia and wool and Logan's run and all of those.

100
00:06:03,094 --> 00:06:06,688
Speaker 1: it's the Apocalypses outside and you're safe inside.

101
00:06:06,809 --> 00:06:08,614
Speaker 1: things of yes fallout is one of.

102
00:06:08,795 --> 00:06:09,417
Speaker 0: well, there's two.

103
00:06:09,457 --> 00:06:13,500
Speaker 0: there's two genres there There's your safe inside and your safe inside.

104
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,872
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway, and that's the thing that I like about fallout.

105
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,879
Speaker 1: Is that you know, the vault boy cartoon?

106
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,255
Speaker 1: Yeah, a little society having a birthday party inside, you know, right?

107
00:06:23,295 --> 00:06:30,880
Speaker 1: I love that action and Once you're outside, it's like this lame, you know post apocalypse mad mag situation.

108
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,874
Speaker 1: But it doesn't have any of the fists of the North Star parts to make it any guy.

109
00:06:34,135 --> 00:06:41,880
Speaker 0: but even worse the more recent Fallouts the open-world like when I got outside in the modern fallouts, it felt really great and looked like this massive world.

110
00:06:42,221 --> 00:06:47,660
Speaker 0: But as soon as it started poking around there wasn't really anything anywhere except the plot flags, right?

111
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,980
Speaker 1: Well, if you had the DLCs, it fills in a lot of this stuff.

112
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:59,940
Speaker 1: so for example, I played oblivion, which is the one that came which is the Yeah, I got time for that's the old scroll one, which is basically all these Bethesda games of the same game, right?

113
00:07:00,364 --> 00:07:10,659
Speaker 1: but yeah oblivion was the old scroll and it came before fallout 3 and That one when I got it was super cheap like $5 or something and was full of DLCs.

114
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:19,080
Speaker 1: I didn't even realize DLCs when I encountered them because the way the DLCs are made is they basically what used to be empty land now has a thing In it, right?

115
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:25,043
Speaker 1: So for example when I played oblivion there was a DLC that was like this quest to get the holy armor and I was like That's my alley.

116
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,729
Speaker 1: That's that's that's Scott right there.

117
00:07:26,749 --> 00:07:29,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, the holy armor be the great Crusader or whatever, right?

118
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,813
Speaker 1: So I discovered this like I didn't even realize it was a DLC.

119
00:07:32,873 --> 00:07:40,440
Speaker 1: I found this holy temple In the middle of nowhere and I went on these quests and I got the holy armor and basically that became my home base.

120
00:07:40,801 --> 00:07:48,199
Speaker 1: I'd always teleport there leave my shit in the treasure chest there right always hang out there always use the holy armor Always be the holy warrior, right?

121
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:56,217
Speaker 1: And I didn't realize there's a DLC until later and it really, you know fills in the empty spaces in that big map Which is why you got to wait for those game of the year editions.

122
00:07:56,237 --> 00:08:02,827
Speaker 1: But anyway The thing about fall 76 that makes me slightly Excited whereas otherwise I'd be meh.

123
00:08:03,308 --> 00:08:03,830
Speaker 1: is that a?

124
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:06,380
Speaker 1: the aesthetic of this trailer is the part that I like.

125
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,856
Speaker 0: It's just got aesthetic and B.

126
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:12,991
Speaker 1: Supposedly, this is not going to be a Bethesda RPG game.

127
00:08:13,452 --> 00:08:13,733
Speaker 1: quote.

128
00:08:13,753 --> 00:08:26,443
Speaker 1: the word on the street is that it's going to be some sort of multiplayer survival game something kind of like a daisy or rust something like that and I'm down.

129
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:27,950
Speaker 1: I haven't you know, I'll go.

130
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:36,480
Speaker 1: I can go for one of those in the Fallout L world multiplayer fallout for real, okay, I am cautiously intrigued and that's all you're gonna get out of me for the time being.

131
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,022
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like can't write that off You know, yeah There you go.

132
00:08:42,303 --> 00:08:44,008
Speaker 0: Cautiously intrigued is the best anyone.

133
00:08:44,028 --> 00:08:46,616
Speaker 1: I was just hoping for another Bethesda RPG.

134
00:08:46,977 --> 00:08:49,266
Speaker 1: Oh, well, yeah You got enough of them.

135
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:59,117
Speaker 1: I mean, I actually played Skyrim a whole bunch but eventually I got to this quest where I had to go up a mountain and there was like a Abominable snowman and I couldn't beat the abominable snowman.

136
00:08:59,137 --> 00:08:59,540
Speaker 1: so I quit.

137
00:09:00,324 --> 00:09:00,807
Speaker 1: I might try.

138
00:09:00,827 --> 00:09:02,918
Speaker 1: I actually had the slight urge to try again.

139
00:09:03,846 --> 00:09:04,229
Speaker 1: So I might.

140
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,198
Speaker 1: I might do that someday.

141
00:09:07,444 --> 00:09:11,607
Speaker 0: So in some other news Mario tennis.

142
00:09:11,788 --> 00:09:13,540
Speaker 0: Mario Danny is coming back.

143
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:26,040
Speaker 1: we've been waiting for this but I was worried because the Mario tennis that was for the the Wii U was just a redo of Previous Mario tennis and the Mario tennis on the DS or the 3ds was el pupa was garbage.

144
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:30,774
Speaker 0: It was basically just a glorified Simon game in 64 and GameCube a Mario tennis.

145
00:09:30,975 --> 00:09:32,640
Speaker 0: All the GameCube one is still so good.

146
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,292
Speaker 1: Those are the real Mario 10.

147
00:09:34,292 --> 00:09:35,440
Speaker 0: I love that Mario tennis.

148
00:09:35,561 --> 00:09:43,443
Speaker 1: So now there's Mario tennis aces for the switch which is an all-new Mario tennis and they had a demo over the weekend Friday Saturday and Sunday and The demo.

149
00:09:43,503 --> 00:09:55,720
Speaker 1: the way it worked is you could play solo against the PC to train PC Switch to train your friend calm your friend calm Or you could play online and the way the online play worked is very clever.

150
00:09:56,362 --> 00:09:58,289
Speaker 1: I want to know why games like Hearthstone don't do.

151
00:09:58,349 --> 00:10:04,220
Speaker 1: this is a bracketed tournament and you get You play and you don't see the whole bracket.

152
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:12,671
Speaker 1: all you see is it just matches you up with someone who also has zero wins in a row and Then if you win it matches you up with someone who has one win.

153
00:10:13,112 --> 00:10:15,460
Speaker 1: and if you win it matches you up against someone who?

154
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:19,090
Speaker 1: Has two wins and it creates the bracket post-hoc.

155
00:10:19,632 --> 00:10:20,253
Speaker 1: and then you.

156
00:10:20,314 --> 00:10:25,049
Speaker 1: I made it to the finals once and then I got I lost And I made it to the semi-finals.

157
00:10:25,169 --> 00:10:27,560
Speaker 1: every other time the semi-finals are tough.

158
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:28,163
Speaker 1: I got lucky.

159
00:10:28,203 --> 00:10:29,570
Speaker 1: what that time I made to the finals.

160
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,133
Speaker 1: I was lucky.

161
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:31,620
Speaker 1: My semi-final opponent was Algarve.

162
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,900
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, I was only able to get two or three games in with humans because everyone had such terrible pain.

163
00:10:37,283 --> 00:10:42,296
Speaker 1: I basically played for a whole bunch of hours Like on Friday and I didn't play it all Saturday or Sunday.

164
00:10:42,337 --> 00:10:42,659
Speaker 1: cuz I'm not.

165
00:10:44,084 --> 00:10:50,063
Speaker 0: The people playing this game had such horrible latency that it was an unplayable like Pointless game.

166
00:10:50,103 --> 00:10:54,100
Speaker 1: Yeah at first I was streaming and I thought oh my streaming is causing the connection to be bad.

167
00:10:54,161 --> 00:10:55,129
Speaker 1: Then I stopped streaming.

168
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:56,420
Speaker 0: No, my connection was fine.

169
00:10:56,561 --> 00:11:01,002
Speaker 1: Yeah, I stopped streaming and I got a little bit better connection But not much.

170
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:03,630
Speaker 1: luckily it let you deny a match.

171
00:11:03,671 --> 00:11:05,697
Speaker 1: like you see your opponent has one bar.

172
00:11:05,857 --> 00:11:06,640
Speaker 1: Well, I'm not playing them.

173
00:11:06,881 --> 00:11:09,357
Speaker 1: Okay, we'll find you another opponent with the same number of wins.

174
00:11:10,361 --> 00:11:14,775
Speaker 1: Okay, and if you keep trying long enough, sometimes you get a good player right away.

175
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:15,497
Speaker 1: Sometimes not.

176
00:11:15,557 --> 00:11:16,600
Speaker 1: I didn't even mind losing.

177
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:19,208
Speaker 1: I just minded playing in some with horrendous lag.

178
00:11:19,268 --> 00:11:25,113
Speaker 0: the few times I found someone I could play with who didn't have terrible lag They were terrible at Mario Tennis.

179
00:11:25,294 --> 00:11:31,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, luckily When this game comes out it's gonna have everything that the other Mario Tennis has had.

180
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:34,311
Speaker 1: Yep, and then we can ignore the online part.

181
00:11:34,331 --> 00:11:36,580
Speaker 1: It's like I paid 50 bucks for GameCube Mario Tennis.

182
00:11:36,942 --> 00:11:38,130
Speaker 1: Why wouldn't I pay 50 bucks?

183
00:11:38,391 --> 00:11:39,478
Speaker 1: and that had no online?

184
00:11:39,539 --> 00:11:39,679
Speaker 1: Yep.

185
00:11:39,881 --> 00:11:43,400
Speaker 1: So why wouldn't I pay 50 bucks for this even if the online didn't exist?

186
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,150
Speaker 1: Well, the trouble is Nintendo and they could fix it too.

187
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:49,040
Speaker 0: Nintendo's charging money for their online play for all their games.

188
00:11:49,145 --> 00:11:49,233
Speaker 0: Yeah

189
00:11:49,381 --> 00:11:51,921
Speaker 1: I'm not paying any amount of money to play online and

190
00:11:52,222 --> 00:11:56,496
Speaker 0: based on the experience with this demo because the whole point of this was that it was an online event

191
00:11:57,037 --> 00:11:57,158
Speaker 1: the

192
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:05,072
Speaker 0: fact that 90 plus percent of all the people I played with we're talking like Multiple second delays between me hitting a button.

193
00:12:05,212 --> 00:12:06,578
Speaker 1: It could have been the netcode too, right?

194
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,600
Speaker 0: You know, I do not trust Nintendo to get it right though.

195
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,860
Speaker 1: No, I'm not paying any extra money for the online play.

196
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,936
Speaker 1: But I probably am gonna pay money for Mario Tennis.

197
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:16,720
Speaker 0: I'll play this in part.

198
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:32,279
Speaker 0: The problem is what I worry is that based on my experiences with other games like on the 3ds that the local multiplayer won't work either Because the pac-man verse local multiplayer works for shit Like it breaks all the time at home.

199
00:12:33,303 --> 00:12:43,092
Speaker 0: So my worry is we won't ever actually be able to play this game with other people ever Unless we put it on a TV and plug two pro controllers in.

200
00:12:43,112 --> 00:12:43,954
Speaker 1: that seems fine.

201
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:53,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, I can live with that but It's I'm getting really worried about the ability to play multiplayer games on the switch because so far it doesn't seem to actually work.

202
00:12:54,921 --> 00:13:07,320
Speaker 0: But in terms of the Mario Tennis game, at least it's not quite as full-on as GameCube and At the end 64 version in that it still has largely removed timing from the game.

203
00:13:07,381 --> 00:13:09,160
Speaker 0: You can't hit the ball sooner.

204
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:15,540
Speaker 0: It does matter because the one way well timing matters in terms of how hard and how well you hit it.

205
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:22,500
Speaker 1: Well, also if your timing is bad is see people didn't realize like there's a lot of subtleties that they didn't teach you in the tutorial.

206
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:34,340
Speaker 1: Yeah basically in the new in this Mario Tennis if your timing is bad if you swing when the ball is too far away from you that's What causes your opponent to get the star around the ball coming on their side?

207
00:13:34,521 --> 00:13:45,813
Speaker 1: Gotta get a well-timed hit so that your hit goes to the other side Just normally and doesn't give your opponent the chance to get some sort of power shot or the zone shot or any of those fancy Shots with the star.

208
00:13:45,955 --> 00:13:52,466
Speaker 1: Yep Right, but there's actually quite a lot going on here a lot more than going on than in the DS one That's for sure.

209
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:53,812
Speaker 1: You got the zone shots.

210
00:13:53,853 --> 00:13:55,440
Speaker 1: You've got this slow-motion thing.

211
00:13:55,480 --> 00:14:03,033
Speaker 0: You got the trick shots for trick shots are interesting because every character is a different trick shot and they're not just an automatic Save no, they're a pain in the ass.

212
00:14:03,073 --> 00:14:04,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, they're really hard.

213
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:05,679
Speaker 1: I kept hitting the arse.

214
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:09,097
Speaker 1: I don't like the control set up because I kept hitting the our stick by accident disabled it.

215
00:14:09,137 --> 00:14:09,740
Speaker 0: you can just turn it off.

216
00:14:09,821 --> 00:14:10,266
Speaker 1: Oh, you can.

217
00:14:10,388 --> 00:14:11,239
Speaker 0: did you go to the options?

218
00:14:12,241 --> 00:14:12,543
Speaker 1: That's like.

219
00:14:12,563 --> 00:14:14,415
Speaker 0: the first option is disable our stick.

220
00:14:14,576 --> 00:14:19,607
Speaker 1: Oh, I gotta do that Anyway, but then I got a prat.

221
00:14:19,788 --> 00:14:22,080
Speaker 1: thing is I was also using the our stick to do the trick shot.

222
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,233
Speaker 1: So I'm gonna have to practice doing the trick shot the other way.

223
00:14:24,455 --> 00:14:25,300
Speaker 1: Yep, but it was nice.

224
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,460
Speaker 1: There were two ways to do almost everything except basic shots.

225
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:33,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, so like even though the instructions were like oh to do the lob use X and something.

226
00:14:34,121 --> 00:14:38,157
Speaker 1: I was able to do the lob with my old AB and BA and the timing is exactly the same.

227
00:14:38,338 --> 00:14:38,960
Speaker 0: Oh that worked.

228
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,865
Speaker 0: I didn't even try that.

229
00:14:39,885 --> 00:14:41,614
Speaker 1: even try to all the old controls just work.

230
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:44,917
Speaker 1: Ah Maybe for the lob BA for the drop shot.

231
00:14:44,977 --> 00:14:45,320
Speaker 1: They like it.

232
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:49,180
Speaker 0: I kept consciously thinking X to do the law no X to do the drop shot.

233
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:50,471
Speaker 1: There's also lots of like.

234
00:14:50,915 --> 00:14:53,468
Speaker 1: for example There's other real subtle things going on.

235
00:14:53,488 --> 00:14:58,844
Speaker 1: if you're in the star your drop shot drops way harsher Lobs way harsher.

236
00:14:58,864 --> 00:14:59,767
Speaker 0: I found.

237
00:14:59,828 --> 00:15:07,535
Speaker 1: also if you do like if you use a to do the the the I don't know Which one is the slice which is his left hook or his right hook.

238
00:15:07,756 --> 00:15:08,660
Speaker 0: B is the slice?

239
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,465
Speaker 1: I don't know which one's hook and which one slice.

240
00:15:10,506 --> 00:15:20,540
Speaker 1: the point is if you do hook then your opponent want and it's like a Power hook then it's gonna knock back the opponent a whole bunch which will allow you to get a much easier drop shot.

241
00:15:20,902 --> 00:15:21,605
Speaker 1: I'm on the volley.

242
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:27,380
Speaker 1: I also find that if they counter it with the right shot Then they'll get knocked back less.

243
00:15:28,108 --> 00:15:33,299
Speaker 1: But if they do that Then you're know which shot they're coming back with and you'll be in position to return it.

244
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:37,540
Speaker 1: So do they get less knock back and do the shot?

245
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:41,573
Speaker 1: They want to do to avoid the drop shot But then you know what it is and they're predictable.

246
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:45,431
Speaker 0: the fact that we can have this Conversation means this is probably gonna be a good Mario tennis.

247
00:15:45,471 --> 00:15:47,920
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a lot going on subtly in this Mario tennis.

248
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,305
Speaker 1: It's it's a worth of playing.

249
00:15:49,727 --> 00:15:51,815
Speaker 0: Yep, but unfortunately, you can't play it.

250
00:15:51,836 --> 00:15:55,132
Speaker 1: The demos gone now Demos gone now and why the fuck was there?

251
00:15:55,193 --> 00:15:56,319
Speaker 1: no boo in the demo?

252
00:15:57,161 --> 00:16:01,877
Speaker 1: Fuck apparently, I think Rosalina though was was very boo like she bug and when she hooks.

253
00:16:02,358 --> 00:16:09,120
Speaker 1: Oh, baby Yeah It hooks bit and chain chomp was apparently the cheap bullshit character because his reach is just like enormous.

254
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,890
Speaker 1: He can hit the ball with barely moving.

255
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:11,915
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, I can reach that.

256
00:16:11,976 --> 00:16:12,559
Speaker 1: I'm a chain chomp.

257
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:13,565
Speaker 1: No No, it's like.

258
00:16:13,585 --> 00:16:15,014
Speaker 1: shouldn't the chain chomp have limited range?

259
00:16:15,054 --> 00:16:15,799
Speaker 1: is he tied down?

260
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:29,340
Speaker 0: yeah, I feel like I'm just gonna buy it when it comes out, but I Would caution you that if you are if you were interested You're not the kind of person like me who will play through all the single-player Mario tennis and who will try to play it.

261
00:16:29,561 --> 00:16:36,593
Speaker 1: You probably don't need to buy it unless you're in a situation We have many people and you will be partying in which case one person should buy it.

262
00:16:36,773 --> 00:16:50,337
Speaker 1: if you're not gonna play it in Person on a TV wait until after it comes out so we can tell you From the e-shop wait until the exact moment You are actually at a party with a bunch of people who want to play it before you buy it.

263
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:53,879
Speaker 1: cuz we're gonna have Unless you're there like me and you're gonna play single-player in practice and get good.

264
00:16:54,081 --> 00:17:01,923
Speaker 0: Yeah, but as soon as it comes out We will on geek nights tell you if online play works at all, right and they could always patch it because it's now internet E right.

265
00:17:01,963 --> 00:17:04,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, so if they you know, and also I'm not paying any money.

266
00:17:04,661 --> 00:17:08,020
Speaker 1: So as soon as they charge money for online play, I'm not paying no matter what.

00:18:16,141 --> 00:18:17,166
Speaker 0: You just can't see you just sir.

289
00:18:17,206 --> 00:18:22,217
Speaker 1: You just yeah, you can't see a concert and it'll be shorter But it totally worth it if you're in the area.

290
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:27,920
Speaker 0: Yep I feel like it took longer for the badges to sell out this year because I feel like it's like less time.

291
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:36,180
Speaker 0: I think it took 37 minutes for Saturday and Sunday to both be sold out But I think that does not account for the fact that the queue was probably already full beyond those days.

292
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,431
Speaker 1: I think their computer system was just you know, well oiled.

293
00:18:39,611 --> 00:18:47,373
Speaker 0: Well, I think also and this is just a suspicion This is not based on any inside knowledge we have but I suspect highly based on guts.

294
00:18:47,734 --> 00:19:02,142
Speaker 0: Yeah that due to the technically distributed nature of PAX West because PAX West is in the WSCC the Washington what at State Convention Center, but it's also in a bunch of hotels in the area like It's in.

295
00:19:02,704 --> 00:19:05,232
Speaker 1: there's a lot of location an ex-place.

296
00:19:05,633 --> 00:19:12,157
Speaker 0: I suspect they sell Way more badges that can fit in the WSCC at any one time.

297
00:19:12,177 --> 00:19:16,389
Speaker 1: I think yes They're definitely selling badges way over the numbers of like.

298
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:24,947
Speaker 1: they're probably combining the capacities of all those places and then adding even more Onto it and just dare in the fire marshal to shut down Because who can catch him right?

299
00:19:25,088 --> 00:19:30,411
Speaker 0: Well, if all those people try to go to the WCC at the same time Yes, then they'll just be like, sorry.

300
00:19:30,451 --> 00:19:31,757
Speaker 0: There's a way to get into the expo hall.

301
00:19:31,817 --> 00:19:32,320
Speaker 0: That'll be fine.

302
00:19:32,561 --> 00:19:37,243
Speaker 0: Yeah, I just suspect that's what's going on with pax's in terms of the badge Situation.

303
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:45,310
Speaker 0: and once again if you are bitter or butter or salty about the fact you didn't get badges There's literally no way to solve that problem.

304
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:45,953
Speaker 0: So stop.

305
00:19:46,114 --> 00:19:46,918
Speaker 0: There's nothing you can do.

306
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:47,340
Speaker 0: Just give up.

307
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:56,000
Speaker 1: Oh, no, there are a hundred things that a thousand people want and I was one of the 900 people that did not get Yeah hundred things where either change it.

308
00:19:56,020 --> 00:19:59,032
Speaker 1: So I'm one of the hundred people and someone else can be one of the 900.

309
00:19:59,032 --> 00:20:02,685
Speaker 0: be sure we'll make the badges cost $500 each and guess what?

310
00:20:02,725 --> 00:20:04,050
Speaker 0: It'll probably still sell out.

311
00:20:04,071 --> 00:20:04,713
Speaker 1: Well, I'm rich.

312
00:20:04,793 --> 00:20:05,576
Speaker 1: I'm okay with that.

313
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:11,197
Speaker 1: Yeah Man, and then the poor people have something that actually legitimately complain is I don't got fucking $500 a day.

314
00:20:12,561 --> 00:20:13,344
Speaker 1: What the fuck is it?

315
00:20:13,525 --> 00:20:17,480
Speaker 0: but I'll just warn you all cuz the other con that's gonna come up not too long after that.

316
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:19,513
Speaker 0: Well, actually it's after not too long artifacts unplugged.

317
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:20,479
Speaker 0: It's mag fast.

318
00:20:21,683 --> 00:20:25,114
Speaker 0: I think mag fest will be selling out just like pax's.

319
00:20:25,174 --> 00:20:27,823
Speaker 1: I think they will sell out the hotel Problem.

320
00:20:28,003 --> 00:20:30,070
Speaker 1: I did not and what much sooner they.

321
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,160
Speaker 0: so mag vest hotel problem is already a fucking disaster.

322
00:20:33,381 --> 00:20:40,724
Speaker 1: Yes, they because the capacity of mag fest is greater than the number of beds they have within walking distance of mag And the.

323
00:20:40,765 --> 00:20:44,760
Speaker 0: the fact that we have a way around that that has nothing to do with mag fest will remain that way.

324
00:20:44,820 --> 00:20:45,888
Speaker 0: I'm never gonna help you guys.

325
00:20:46,432 --> 00:20:52,795
Speaker 0: Sorry you're on your own But I think the mag fest badge situation is gonna get bad to me eventually.

326
00:20:53,657 --> 00:21:03,247
Speaker 0: I that's my suspicion but anyway things Of the day.

327
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:08,168
Speaker 0: so this made the rounds like wildfire probably thanks to the share zone.

328
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:14,299
Speaker 0: the share zone has done a done its part to make sure that Everyone in the world is aware of bofa.

329
00:21:15,714 --> 00:21:22,640
Speaker 0: so Horses as you know have really really stupid names in horse racing.

330
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,967
Speaker 1: So I watched the first episode of Uma Musume.

331
00:21:25,609 --> 00:21:28,016
Speaker 1: the characters also have horse names.

332
00:21:28,077 --> 00:21:30,067
Speaker 1: Just like these horses Do they have to?

333
00:21:30,249 --> 00:21:35,092
Speaker 0: yes, that's how it goes You know like Cumber Bunch and toilet paper.

334
00:21:35,232 --> 00:21:39,624
Speaker 0: and there's a famous horse that was just called our Horse we saw in Australia.

335
00:21:39,884 --> 00:21:41,870
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Far Lap Far Lap.

336
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,313
Speaker 1: No, isn't Far Lap the game?

337
00:21:43,634 --> 00:21:45,800
Speaker 0: Far Lap was the giant goddamn horse.

338
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:46,683
Speaker 1: What's the get?

339
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:47,906
Speaker 1: a long shot is the game?

340
00:21:47,927 --> 00:21:49,431
Speaker 0: Yeah Far Lap.

341
00:21:49,471 --> 00:21:52,240
Speaker 0: Here's this Wikipedia page the biggest goddamn horse ever.

342
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,786
Speaker 1: This horse is like an elephant.

343
00:21:53,867 --> 00:21:55,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, they have him stuffed.

344
00:21:56,197 --> 00:21:56,819
Speaker 1: We saw it.

345
00:21:57,802 --> 00:22:03,416
Speaker 0: He saw the taxidermy body and all I have to say is that you might think with our own eyeballs You are surely exaggerating.

346
00:22:03,436 --> 00:22:09,500
Speaker 1: the size Next to a horse and it's big and Far Lap was up on a pedestal, but no Far Lap is enormous.

347
00:22:09,863 --> 00:22:11,637
Speaker 0: It is shocking how big that horse was.

348
00:22:12,161 --> 00:22:15,240
Speaker 1: It's obvious why the other horses were not as fast as Far Lap.

349
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:28,392
Speaker 0: But the other great thing about horse racing is that there's the horse racing announcer, which is a professional Yep and coming around the bend is both of these nuts.

350
00:22:28,974 --> 00:22:40,428
Speaker 0: and the thing about horse racing announcers is that they have to with aplomb be able to say the names of these horses and not laugh at them and The to this gentleman's.

351
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:41,516
Speaker 1: try to do that job.

352
00:22:41,556 --> 00:22:43,468
Speaker 1: I could do it To this gentleman.

353
00:22:43,709 --> 00:22:44,594
Speaker 1: that job pays enough.

354
00:22:44,855 --> 00:22:55,520
Speaker 0: I don't think so but he is capable of Announcing the fact that both of these nuts won the race Without at any point cracking up, which I don't think I would have been able to do.

355
00:22:55,761 --> 00:23:03,412
Speaker 1: I think that, you know, that person has probably been announcing many horse races with equally Probably not even in the top ten funniest names.

356
00:23:03,452 --> 00:23:04,658
Speaker 0: He's dealt with over the years.

357
00:23:04,718 --> 00:23:08,280
Speaker 0: Yeah But this video really made the rounds.

358
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:11,673
Speaker 0: In fact, right before the show Scott was like, here's my thing of the day.

359
00:23:11,693 --> 00:23:13,360
Speaker 0: and I was like, that's already my thing of the day.

360
00:23:15,422 --> 00:23:21,273
Speaker 1: So I found another thing in the day, yeah so we've done things of the day of videos similar to this before.

361
00:23:21,313 --> 00:23:29,780
Speaker 1: I guess this sort of like this genre of You know because like the speedrunning community they just love to promote themselves and they're like they love to like talk.

362
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:31,798
Speaker 1: You know, it's like they got this whole thing going on.

363
00:23:32,381 --> 00:23:38,800
Speaker 1: So there's plenty of videos on YouTube where people explain how to do a speedrun how these glitches work.

364
00:23:39,182 --> 00:23:43,895
Speaker 1: You know, there's like this whole genre of like super In-depth explanation of video game thing.

365
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:44,640
Speaker 0: I love this shit.

366
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,264
Speaker 0: Subscribe to like.

367
00:23:46,325 --> 00:23:48,856
Speaker 1: all these are way more detail than you ever needed to know.

368
00:23:48,917 --> 00:23:57,425
Speaker 1: and there's a channel Called summoning salt and it's a somewhat recently made channel and this channel explains the history of Particular speedrun.

369
00:23:57,466 --> 00:24:02,808
Speaker 1: So he's like Megaman - he's like well the first recorded speedrun We have a Megaman - is this guy with this time?

370
00:24:02,828 --> 00:24:06,663
Speaker 1: and then this person to figured out this trick and got Faster.

371
00:24:06,704 --> 00:24:09,020
Speaker 1: and then this person got faster just by working real hard.

372
00:24:09,341 --> 00:24:12,596
Speaker 1: And then this person figured out this trick and got faster and so on and so on.

373
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:17,780
Speaker 1: and you know They describe the drama of the people involved the tricks that they figured out.

374
00:24:18,082 --> 00:24:23,045
Speaker 1: You know the all this kind of stuff and some of these Are not too exciting.

375
00:24:23,085 --> 00:24:27,520
Speaker 1: the Super Metroid one would you think would be the super exciting ones is like the number one speedrun game?

376
00:24:28,865 --> 00:24:29,820
Speaker 1: It was not that exciting.

377
00:24:29,902 --> 00:24:41,806
Speaker 1: It was just pretty much like well It was this person and then this person practiced harder and this person practiced harder and then these two people went back and forth But practicing more and then this person practiced more and it's like yeah All right, and this person got lucky.

378
00:24:42,187 --> 00:24:43,612
Speaker 1: there wasn't any like development, right?

379
00:24:44,033 --> 00:24:44,696
Speaker 1: But the video.

380
00:24:44,716 --> 00:24:46,000
Speaker 1: there's some really good ones on here.

381
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,961
Speaker 1: This is one about Choco Mountain Mario Kart 64.

382
00:24:48,961 --> 00:24:52,300
Speaker 1: This one goes deep and it is crazy.

383
00:24:52,521 --> 00:24:58,160
Speaker 1: And why did this one person waste their lives with tens of thousands of attempts on to get this trick three times?

384
00:24:58,580 --> 00:25:04,380
Speaker 0: Well, basically, I feel like that trick like what he did was basically going for the full web in player of games.

385
00:25:04,483 --> 00:25:14,979
Speaker 1: Yeah He got the full web And it was amazing that I was able to watch you and gain all the joy of that full web in like 15 20 minutes Whereas you probably spent like years of your life getting for that full web.

386
00:25:17,062 --> 00:25:21,820
Speaker 1: But if you want to get all that enjoyment in the fame 15 minutes is some videos on this channel.

00:25:46,939 --> 00:25:47,320
Speaker 0: I assume.

395
00:25:47,441 --> 00:25:48,466
Speaker 1: No, I was on the.

396
00:25:48,627 --> 00:25:51,200

00:25:52,283 --> 00:25:53,960
Speaker 1: So I read it when I was standing on the choo-choo.

398
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,105

Speaker 1: So we got stuff to say.

430
00:27:50,644 --> 00:27:57,746
Speaker 0: I think the two best shows that I actually watched some episodes of From our judge animes so far.

431
00:27:57,807 --> 00:27:58,790
Speaker 0: We're pop team epic.

432
00:27:59,733 --> 00:27:59,933
Speaker 0: Mmm.

433
00:28:00,315 --> 00:28:00,896
Speaker 0: I really like.

434
00:28:00,957 --> 00:28:01,619
Speaker 0: I keep watching it.

435
00:28:01,699 --> 00:28:02,040
Speaker 0: It's good.

436
00:28:02,281 --> 00:28:12,485
Speaker 0: Okay, no, I will admit I don't always watch the second half even though I appreciate what the second half is that and What was the other?

437
00:28:12,505 --> 00:28:15,178
Speaker 0: I forget what other one I was actually intrigued by anyway.

438
00:28:18,223 --> 00:28:21,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, well made in abyss is the show I actually like the most recently.

439
00:28:22,462 --> 00:28:24,830
Speaker 0: I don't remember if we talked about that one or not.

440
00:28:24,890 --> 00:28:25,151
Speaker 1: I don't know.

441
00:28:25,251 --> 00:28:27,720
Speaker 1: you might have anyway go see what we judged.

442
00:28:28,701 --> 00:28:35,990
Speaker 0: We've been waiting for fucking shapes and beats to come out as far as I can remember Forever so many many packs ago.

443
00:28:36,010 --> 00:28:36,954
Speaker 1: I don't know how many packs.

444
00:28:36,974 --> 00:28:38,260
Speaker 1: I feel like my entire life.

445
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:39,244
Speaker 0: I've gone to a packs.

446
00:28:39,486 --> 00:28:40,531
Speaker 0: I've seen shapes and beads.

447
00:28:40,772 --> 00:28:43,624
Speaker 0: I asked him what it's gonna come out and I said There's a guy standing there.

448
00:28:43,644 --> 00:28:44,407
Speaker 1: He's got this game.

449
00:28:44,468 --> 00:28:46,315
Speaker 1: The game is pumping fucking awesome music.

450
00:28:46,375 --> 00:28:47,218
Speaker 0: It already looks great.

451
00:28:47,319 --> 00:28:47,620
Speaker 0: I'm willing.

452
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:54,800
Speaker 1: He's got four controllers and on the screen are these little shapes and the shapes are dodging things and it's pretty much bullet hell.

453
00:28:54,901 --> 00:29:08,564
Speaker 1: We all you do is dodge but you don't shoot with a really bumping like style and out and all the obstacles that you don't want to bump into are moving and appearing to the rhythm of the awesome bump in music and There's pretty much all.

454
00:29:08,584 --> 00:29:11,780
Speaker 1: you can just see the game in two seconds and know everything there is to know about it.

455
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:23,658
Speaker 1: The only other thing you need to know is that what if you press a button you do a very short teleport and that short Teleport lets you a move fast to get out of the way and be teleport through an otherwise impenetrable obstacle without dying.

456
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:30,420
Speaker 1: if you You know position yourself correctly and don't teleport into the obstacle as I often do which you will do very very often.

457
00:29:30,923 --> 00:29:32,150
Speaker 1: So we waited years.

458
00:29:32,190 --> 00:29:32,975
Speaker 1: we'd go to packs.

459
00:29:33,156 --> 00:29:33,720
Speaker 1: We'd see the game.

460
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,760
Speaker 1: We go to another packs and see the game again.

461
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:41,239
Speaker 1: The game was it following us around to every packs and every time we went to packs The game would change a little bit and it got to the point.

462
00:29:41,601 --> 00:29:47,760
Speaker 0: I feel like video ball appeared got released and then died but in the span of us waiting for shapes and beads.

463
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:48,362
Speaker 1: That is correct.

464
00:29:48,965 --> 00:29:53,080
Speaker 1: The only game I've seen in more packs is is spy party, which has been in every pack.

465
00:29:54,103 --> 00:29:54,425
Speaker 1: Come out.

466
00:29:54,445 --> 00:30:00,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, so Shapes and beats improved a little bit the first few times I saw it and then I said, you know what?

467
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,460
Speaker 1: I don't need to keep monitoring this game for every little improvement I'll just wait for it to be out and done every year.

468
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,380
Speaker 0: I just went up to the booth and I was like when's it coming out?

469
00:30:08,122 --> 00:30:13,140
Speaker 1: At the beginning of this year I walked past the booth and it was quieter because the pack south.

470
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:14,626
Speaker 1: Yeah, the guy is the same guy.

471
00:30:14,666 --> 00:30:18,460
Speaker 1: is there the developer guy and I said hey this game actually fucking coming out.

472
00:30:18,501 --> 00:30:19,332
Speaker 1: I've seen you like 20 times.

473
00:30:20,632 --> 00:30:21,059
Speaker 1: He's like.

474
00:30:21,962 --> 00:30:23,979
Speaker 1: He's like you should look for something soon.

475
00:30:24,244 --> 00:30:31,600
Speaker 1: He's like, you know He actually gave some firm stuff and sure enough the game came out for switch and steam like last week.

476
00:30:32,002 --> 00:30:32,545
Speaker 0: It's so good.

477
00:30:32,947 --> 00:30:33,409
Speaker 1: It's so good.

478
00:30:33,449 --> 00:30:36,143
Speaker 1: So it's everything we expected all that time we were waiting.

479
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:41,945
Speaker 1: they were polishing and polishing and polishing and polishing and That's what makes a good game.

480
00:30:42,286 --> 00:30:46,922
Speaker 1: is hella polish and this is pretty much exactly what it was the first day We saw it.

481
00:30:47,023 --> 00:30:48,388
Speaker 1: it is you're a little shape.

482
00:30:48,689 --> 00:30:51,220
Speaker 1: don't touch the obstacles this bump in music.

483
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:56,580
Speaker 1: The obstacles move according to the music so you can predict them and you can also visually predict them too.

484
00:30:56,761 --> 00:31:02,349
Speaker 1: if in case you can't hear yeah, and The end it's fucking awesome.

485
00:31:02,731 --> 00:31:03,896
Speaker 1: it's polished like crazy.

486
00:31:03,936 --> 00:31:04,820
Speaker 1: so it's so perfect.

487
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:10,720
Speaker 0: So what it reminds me of very heavily even though obviously there's a lot of differences because super hexagon was a very simple game.

488
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:13,050
Speaker 1: Super hexagon is dodge the things.

489
00:31:13,311 --> 00:31:15,220
Speaker 1: Yeah, and it's bumping music bumping.

490
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:20,000
Speaker 1: It's changes and it's just shapes on the screen very, you know, geometrical solid colors.

491
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:29,160
Speaker 1: But super hexagon the differences is a not as much variation of shapes and beats No, not as much music as shapes and beats much smaller simpler game.

492
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:34,597
Speaker 0: But it's scratched the same itch that shapes you don't move don't move freely.

493
00:31:34,658 --> 00:31:42,853
Speaker 1: in super hexagon You just sort of rotate left or right as you're sort of, you know Your way out of the middle and super hexagon isn't always the same pattern.

494
00:31:42,894 --> 00:31:45,586
Speaker 1: every time it's like depends on what mode you're in Right, but there's like.

495
00:31:45,606 --> 00:31:47,200
Speaker 0: I played a lot of super hexagon.

496
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,880
Speaker 1: There's like a few different patterns and they come at you in different, you know.

497
00:31:51,501 --> 00:31:58,340
Speaker 1: So it's like pattern one pattern two pattern one And the next time you play it be like pattern four pattern four pattern four pattern one, right?

498
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:02,040
Speaker 1: You know, you know see memorize the individual patterns and learn to recognize them quickly.

499
00:32:02,441 --> 00:32:10,549
Speaker 1: Whereas in shapes and beats you just memorize the level as a whole and then it doesn't change it even one pixel but shapes and beats like I.

500
00:32:10,589 --> 00:32:22,307
Speaker 0: just it's interesting to me how Equally my brain puts these two games in terms of if there's a if I want a certain kind of feeling in my life They both provide that feeling a hundred percent, right?

501
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:23,190
Speaker 1: So shapes and beats.

502
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:26,700
Speaker 1: in its final form a has plenty of fucking songs.

503
00:32:26,981 --> 00:32:30,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no shortage of songs in it and I'm sure there'll be more in the future.

504
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:34,539
Speaker 1: They're all they'd manage to get that fucking Mortal Kombat song in there.

505
00:32:36,041 --> 00:32:37,647
Speaker 1: They got the license, you know, cuz he saw.

506
00:32:37,688 --> 00:32:38,089
Speaker 1: we saw.

507
00:32:38,109 --> 00:32:46,032
Speaker 0: that was like a demo at PAX was the Mortal Kombat song You know, and they already said there will be DLC So that I am confident we're gonna be able to get.

508
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:48,786
Speaker 1: and we knew they were trying to get it in there But I thought it might not get in there.

509
00:32:48,806 --> 00:32:49,569
Speaker 1: do the licensing.

510
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,256
Speaker 0: They got it in there.

511
00:32:51,277 --> 00:32:51,357
Speaker 1: Yeah.

512
00:32:51,518 --> 00:32:55,214
Speaker 1: Yeah That's where it's worth buying it alone just for that one level.

513
00:32:55,334 --> 00:33:01,558
Speaker 0: So some other interesting things about it Is that in terms of gameplay - it is way more varied than you might expect.

514
00:33:01,638 --> 00:33:02,160
Speaker 0: It's what it's like.

515
00:33:02,361 --> 00:33:03,346
Speaker 1: That's what the polish is.

516
00:33:03,386 --> 00:33:05,940
Speaker 1: they polished it so much that it's like so creative.

517
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,007
Speaker 1: It's like you think.

518
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:08,740
Speaker 1: how many different ways can you make crazy?

519
00:33:09,380 --> 00:33:14,400
Speaker 1: Rhythmic obstacles with shapes that are bullet like every level is completely different from every other level.

520
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:21,514
Speaker 0: Remember that Atari game design panel we did a few times where we talk about Surround on the Atari and how that game live wasn't called sir.

521
00:33:21,575 --> 00:33:22,317
Speaker 0: It literally try.

522
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:29,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was Ron basically, but how that Atari game fully explores every possible mode.

523
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:33,462
Speaker 0: You could have for that very simple set of rules Shaves and beats.

524
00:33:33,502 --> 00:33:40,440
Speaker 0: does that for this concept and the levels are all so shockingly varied that you will really be impressed playing it.

525
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:42,840
Speaker 0: Sometimes it's bullet hell.

526
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:52,639
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's just like these giant rhythmic heaven like stay in the right spot and the best is like there isn't I'm sure there Isn't seem to be like a best approach to any one part or no.

527
00:33:53,041 --> 00:33:56,119
Speaker 1: There's never any like one way like ah the way to get through this to do this.

528
00:33:56,462 --> 00:33:58,879
Speaker 1: Sometimes you can get through something by teleporting a whole bunch.

529
00:33:59,261 --> 00:34:05,800
Speaker 1: Sometimes you can get through something by staying really quite still and moving very slightly just to stay just away.

530
00:34:06,021 --> 00:34:09,643
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but then sometimes you're just moving around like crazy like that Right.

531
00:34:09,663 --> 00:34:13,940
Speaker 1: It's like sometimes you can just hide in the corner and not even move and you know, it's like that strategy work.

532
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:19,577
Speaker 1: Sometimes it's like you can always approach something in a different way and it can work or not work.

533
00:34:19,597 --> 00:34:21,202
Speaker 1: Who knows, you know Like.

534
00:34:21,764 --> 00:34:24,399
Speaker 1: sometimes where it seems like okay, there is only one way to do this.

535
00:34:24,782 --> 00:34:27,599
Speaker 1: Sometimes the execution really matters like okay, I have to teleport it.

536
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,980
Speaker 1: There's a big disc rolling towards me with a hole in the middle.

537
00:34:30,302 --> 00:34:33,620
Speaker 1: I got a teleport into the disc and then teleport out the other side of the disc.

538
00:34:33,681 --> 00:34:34,757
Speaker 1: There's no other way to do this.

539
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,179
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you got to do it just right because in the middle of the disc is a solid ball.

540
00:34:40,641 --> 00:34:45,560
Speaker 1: You got it's like and I would knew exactly what I had to do, but the execution had to be tight on that part.

541
00:34:45,701 --> 00:34:54,790
Speaker 0: it's also a really good balance of Elements coming out of the screen and telegraphing what they're going to do in some way Coupled with bullet hell.

542
00:34:54,830 --> 00:34:56,260
Speaker 0: nonsense, that's just coming at you.

543
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,800
Speaker 0: I just deal with bullet hell.

544
00:34:57,900 --> 00:34:59,347
Speaker 1: But it's not so hellish.

545
00:34:59,367 --> 00:35:02,059
Speaker 1: to the point where you're like fuck this game cuz I'm really bad at right.

546
00:35:02,661 --> 00:35:03,985
Speaker 1: It's right on that border.

547
00:35:04,025 --> 00:35:08,859
Speaker 1: Like it's like one step easier than super meat boy in terms of annoyingness of hellishness.

548
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:10,360
Speaker 1: Yep It's like you can do it.

549
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:17,848
Speaker 1: I made it to the final boss and the only reason they haven't beaten the final boss is because I just haven't sat down and Like done it enough until I beat it.

550
00:35:17,868 --> 00:35:20,620
Speaker 0: cuz story mode also has two really good things going for it.

551
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:22,760
Speaker 0: It has a pretty good checkpointing system, right?

552
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,046
Speaker 1: So that yeah This you're not really gonna have.

553
00:35:25,086 --> 00:35:29,483
Speaker 1: the only time that you're gonna have problems with checkpoints is when you're actually fighting a boss and there Are no checkpoints.

554
00:35:29,503 --> 00:35:33,260
Speaker 1: You know heat the whole boss at once which is also why I haven't beaten the final boss.

555
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:36,374
Speaker 0: But the other cool thing is that they have just a casual mode you can turn on.

556
00:35:36,394 --> 00:35:37,580
Speaker 0: that gives you double life.

557
00:35:37,801 --> 00:35:39,472
Speaker 1: Yeah, casual mode is like way easy.

558
00:35:39,553 --> 00:35:44,180
Speaker 1: I'm playing a normal mode Yeah, and I'm at the final final boss and I don't plan to turn on the casual mode.

559
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:47,029
Speaker 0: I don't need it, but I'm glad they have the casual mode.

560
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:51,979
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's because remember a tumble seed how There was no casual mode.

561
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:53,826
Speaker 1: It was just balls.

562
00:35:53,906 --> 00:36:05,405
Speaker 0: It was like Mega Man 2 style normal and difficult Yeah, so the other really cool thing is that it has a pretty because this game is so pulsing thumping flashing in your face.

563
00:36:05,526 --> 00:36:07,071
Speaker 1: the intro does a little bit bet.

564
00:36:07,111 --> 00:36:10,248
Speaker 1: the intro part of the game does a little bit better at the timing of the thumping.

565
00:36:10,289 --> 00:36:13,210
Speaker 1: and then You know the levels still have it.

566
00:36:13,250 --> 00:36:15,560
Speaker 1: but the outside the levels it gets a little bit less.

567
00:36:15,621 --> 00:36:16,676
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know.

568
00:36:17,241 --> 00:36:19,533
Speaker 1: But it also that intro is just so high.

569
00:36:19,553 --> 00:36:21,000
Speaker 1: the first has levels are so high.

570
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:25,060
Speaker 0: It has an accessible mode so that you can tone down the flashing.

571
00:36:25,522 --> 00:36:27,855
Speaker 0: So if your photo says the first thing that happens you turn on.

572
00:36:27,875 --> 00:36:30,848
Speaker 1: the game is is oh my god If you have seizures don't play this fucking game.

573
00:36:30,868 --> 00:36:33,620
Speaker 0: I'm like, yeah, but it has a mode that'll minimize that.

574
00:36:33,721 --> 00:36:40,540
Speaker 0: So some people who might be on the edge Might still be able to play this game and the fact that they went to that level even for a game like this.

575
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:42,812
Speaker 1: I think it was obvious if you make this game.

576
00:36:42,833 --> 00:36:49,008
Speaker 1: It's obvious that it is strobe light the game There.

577
00:36:49,028 --> 00:36:53,047
Speaker 0: it's also got Online multiplayer and local multiplayer.

578
00:36:53,067 --> 00:36:56,478
Speaker 0: Yeah competitive and co-op basically like semi-competitive.

579
00:36:56,578 --> 00:37:01,560
Speaker 1: Yep And basically it's you and a bunch of other people on the screen at the same time all dodging stuff together.

580
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:05,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think you can bring each other back to life and it's just really really fun.

581
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,840
Speaker 1: It also has yeah, it's like why would I want to bring something back to life and competing against them?

582
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:13,880
Speaker 1: Well, you get it ahead if you bring them back to life and then they even though they get a chance to score some.

583
00:37:14,505 --> 00:37:16,500
Speaker 0: But also the game with the multiplayer.

584
00:37:17,062 --> 00:37:20,113
Speaker 0: It's really set up with multiplayer casual mode combined.

585
00:37:20,133 --> 00:37:28,457
Speaker 0: to basically put it in this party mode Where this is the kind of game when you're out of house party You put it on one of the TVs with four controllers.

586
00:37:28,497 --> 00:37:29,764
Speaker 1: party mode Basically, just keep.

587
00:37:29,864 --> 00:37:33,280
Speaker 1: there's a party mode specifically and what it does is keeps playing music over and over.

588
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:33,984
Speaker 1: It'll stop.

589
00:37:34,325 --> 00:37:35,411
Speaker 1: you can just pick up controllers.

590
00:37:35,491 --> 00:37:37,180
Speaker 1: put them down doesn't keep score.

591
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,672
Speaker 1: It just keeps playing shapes and beats keeps changing songs over and over.

592
00:37:40,813 --> 00:37:41,475
Speaker 1: I am confident.

593
00:37:41,515 --> 00:37:42,780
Speaker 0: at the next go Joe Laura party.

594
00:37:43,102 --> 00:37:44,433
Speaker 0: This is what's gonna be in that TV.

595
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:46,043
Speaker 0: instead of star wall Yeah, why not?

596
00:37:46,385 --> 00:37:48,817
Speaker 0: cuz I'm gonna go put it on the TV before people show up to the party.

597
00:37:48,857 --> 00:37:49,259
Speaker 0: That's right.

598
00:37:50,622 --> 00:38:00,600
Speaker 1: The only things negative I can say about this game is that there are like a few Little wiggly niggles that you know, it's like they polished it so much but you can never be perfect, right?

599
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:04,220
Speaker 1: So one thing that bothered me is as a level one level in particular.

600
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:12,325
Speaker 1: But there's other places where it happens and where these spikes are falling from the ceiling and landing in the water in quotes And making a splash.

601
00:38:12,606 --> 00:38:13,068
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

602
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:14,031
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was real hard.

603
00:38:14,372 --> 00:38:20,999
Speaker 1: And well, yeah, but when the splash comes out There's a bunch of balls of splashing water in quotes, which is just pink balls of death.

604
00:38:21,924 --> 00:38:24,799
Speaker 1: The pink balls of death were actually see a lot of the game.

605
00:38:25,442 --> 00:38:30,200
Speaker 1: There are places where for example, there'll be a solid horizontal bar on the screen.

606
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:35,899
Speaker 1: That's that sort of faded pink and then it becomes solid pink and when they become solid it's when it kills you.

607
00:38:36,241 --> 00:38:41,946
Speaker 1: Yeah, faded one is the warning like don't stand here get the hell out of the way Yeah, and that's great.

608
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:44,600
Speaker 0: That's perfect design and you think oh doesn't that make it too easy?

609
00:38:46,201 --> 00:38:50,573
Speaker 1: The pink in this area where the splashing there are pink balls of water splashing.

610
00:38:50,894 --> 00:38:54,110
Speaker 1: those pink balls were not solid pink They were the faded pink.

611
00:38:54,917 --> 00:38:59,340
Speaker 1: Oh And they did not and they did not ever become solid.

612
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:02,689
Speaker 1: They just stayed faded and landed in the ground landed back in the.

613
00:39:02,930 --> 00:39:04,033
Speaker 1: those shouldn't kill you.

614
00:39:04,173 --> 00:39:04,915
Speaker 1: They don't kill you.

615
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:12,700
Speaker 1: Oh, okay, but Because they weren't like faded and then becoming solid it felt like they were gonna kill me.

616
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:16,512
Speaker 1: So I was like avoiding them subconsciously and it took a while to realize.

617
00:39:16,732 --> 00:39:19,180
Speaker 1: Oh, those aren't deadly at any time.

618
00:39:19,321 --> 00:39:22,058
Speaker 1: Why are they even on the screen if they're not deadly ever, right?

619
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:26,477
Speaker 1: I mean, I would be like imagine if a horizontal faded bar appeared and you stayed there.

620
00:39:26,497 --> 00:39:27,240
Speaker 0: That'd be brilliant.

621
00:39:27,361 --> 00:39:28,868
Speaker 0: You got so afraid of it.

622
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:31,180
Speaker 1: You got out of the way and it never became solid.

623
00:39:31,321 --> 00:39:32,365
Speaker 0: I'd be so afraid of.

624
00:39:32,405 --> 00:39:34,173
Speaker 0: that thing is just hanging out there a whole level.

625
00:39:34,494 --> 00:39:35,840
Speaker 1: Yes, but I'm just great.

626
00:39:36,021 --> 00:39:39,580
Speaker 1: I'm just saying is that that's kind of like, you know, there were parts of the game that were like that.

627
00:39:39,640 --> 00:39:40,402
Speaker 1: They're a little air.

628
00:39:40,904 --> 00:39:47,105
Speaker 1: also the teleport, you know if you have to sort of judge its distance and get used to it I teleport.

629
00:39:47,125 --> 00:39:49,560
Speaker 1: like Rick you said I teleported into things a lot.

630
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:54,315
Speaker 1: Yeah, also if you teleport and you're not currently holding a stick in a direction.

631
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:54,917
Speaker 0: Yeah, good.

632
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:55,158
Speaker 0: Good.

633
00:39:55,198 --> 00:39:58,293
Speaker 1: God help you It always goes right on the screen East.

634
00:39:58,735 --> 00:40:03,437
Speaker 1: so there'll be times I'm like go left left left left left and then I press teleport.

635
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:10,100
Speaker 1: and Because I let go of the stick like a fraction of a second too soon I teleported to the right instead of the left, right?

636
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:15,965
Speaker 1: Yeah, I feel like if you press teleport and you're not holding it in any direction at all You should teleport completely still.

637
00:40:16,346 --> 00:40:24,147
Speaker 0: so the last thing about this game that's worth talking about is that it is available both on steam And not in the Nintendo switch.

638
00:40:24,368 --> 00:40:25,793
Speaker 1: and which one do you buy it for?

639
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:27,540
Speaker 0: I actually bought it on the switch.

640
00:40:27,701 --> 00:40:31,140
Speaker 0: I bought it on the steam because I'm gonna play it when I'm just going around.

641
00:40:31,441 --> 00:40:35,100
Speaker 1: I wanted to play it when I was going around because that's how I play super hexagon.

642
00:40:35,321 --> 00:40:38,815
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the thing is I bought it on the steam because it was $3 cheaper.

643
00:40:38,835 --> 00:40:43,450
Speaker 1: Yeah I thought there was a DLC but I was wrong.

644
00:40:43,591 --> 00:40:46,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, Scott Scott was like, oh I told Scott I got about the switch version.

645
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,426
Speaker 0: He's like, oh, well, can you get the DLC?

646
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:52,560
Speaker 0: I was frantically googling like what fucking DLC is he talking about?

647
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:53,626
Speaker 0: Why can't I get it?

648
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:55,518
Speaker 0: Why is no one talking about this DLC?

649
00:40:56,681 --> 00:40:59,309
Speaker 1: So on this on the steam page there's no DLC.

650
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,232
Speaker 1: there's a DLC.

651
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:02,619
Speaker 1: it's a soundtrack of mp3s, it's not DLC.

652
00:41:03,141 --> 00:41:04,366
Speaker 0: That's just a soundtrack.

653
00:41:04,546 --> 00:41:06,152
Speaker 1: I know but it looks like a DLC.

654
00:41:06,192 --> 00:41:07,617
Speaker 1: So I paid three dollars for some mp3s.

655
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:10,549
Speaker 1: So I paid a dollar more than the switch version.

656
00:41:10,609 --> 00:41:12,095
Speaker 1: I paid three dollars less.

657
00:41:12,376 --> 00:41:13,180
Speaker 1: So steam is cheaper.

658
00:41:13,762 --> 00:41:17,738
Speaker 1: Steam won't go away when the switch is no longer a console people play.

659
00:41:17,879 --> 00:41:20,086
Speaker 1: true It is probably.

660
00:41:20,106 --> 00:41:25,666
Speaker 1: you know, there might be a situation where I was afraid Oh the switch won't get updated But you know what tumbleseed get.

661
00:41:25,686 --> 00:41:28,660
Speaker 1: all the updates of the steam got in very good time because I have tumbleseed.

662
00:41:28,721 --> 00:41:30,274
Speaker 1: I'm confident when there's real DLC.

663
00:41:30,315 --> 00:41:30,920
Speaker 0: It'll be available.

664
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,706
Speaker 1: I have tumbleseed on switch instead of on Steam because I wanted to play tumbleseed in bed with two sticks.

665
00:41:37,726 --> 00:41:44,080
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I can play you know Shapes and be just fine with anything with one stick.

666
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:44,683
Speaker 1: I didn't need this.

667
00:41:44,763 --> 00:41:49,024
Speaker 0: part of the reason why I got on the switch is that I can still play it with four people on My TV.

668
00:41:49,064 --> 00:41:51,320
Speaker 1: that way we can play it with four people on my TV.

669
00:41:51,661 --> 00:41:55,173
Speaker 0: Well, my htpc Scott is from late 2008.

670
00:41:55,173 --> 00:41:59,366
Speaker 0: No, it's got a GTX for video.

671
00:41:59,447 --> 00:42:02,135
Speaker 1: mine has an integrated Intel because I took the video card out.

672
00:42:02,195 --> 00:42:13,460
Speaker 1: I got a core i5 and it had 50 and had a 1070 but I took it out and put it in my desktop for Starwall has frame rate issues.

673
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:14,625
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna get one of those.

674
00:42:14,725 --> 00:42:18,360
Speaker 1: their Nvidia is coming out with these 1050s that are three gigs of video ram.

675
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:22,100
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna get one of those from htpc because it doesn't require any extra power cables.

676
00:42:22,461 --> 00:42:27,800
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to do a lot of party games on the switch for a while and then hold out one.

677
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:30,308
Speaker 0: I think you can go wrong picking either console.

678
00:42:30,409 --> 00:42:30,669
Speaker 1: Really?

679
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:33,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just like the dip, you know, it's just pick whatever.

680
00:42:35,002 --> 00:42:40,338
Speaker 1: I was going to say well get on steam and if I really played a whole bunch I'll get it on switch also cuz worth it.

681
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the single player is the kind where I beat it once and then I'm done.

682
00:42:44,222 --> 00:42:45,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I don't really need to do that.

683
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:53,176
Speaker 1: There are a bunch of challenges and nonsense if you're a masochist and I'm saying oh one other thing Is this an overworld in this game?

684
00:42:53,216 --> 00:43:01,900
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah The single player has an overworld like Mario 3 style or Lolo 3 style Where you go from level to level right even though the actual game plays in the levels.

685
00:43:02,663 --> 00:43:06,700
Speaker 1: But the overworld actually has some gameplay even though you can't die or anything.

686
00:43:07,262 --> 00:43:10,613
Speaker 1: And it's the overworld is way cute and the pirate ship is the best.

687
00:43:10,673 --> 00:43:11,014
Speaker 1: Yeah.

688
00:43:11,195 --> 00:43:12,660
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a helicopter.

689
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,047
Speaker 1: The helicopter is cute, but the pirate ship is best.

690
00:43:15,408 --> 00:43:17,434
Speaker 1: and the overworld is like really it's.

691
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:25,544
Speaker 1: it's like a really really good overworld that has rhythm and it has cute graphics and it has a story and It's way good.

692
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:30,341
Speaker 1: So I guess all you really say is one of the best one of the best Overworlds.

693
00:43:30,683 --> 00:43:32,634
Speaker 1: that isn't like, you know a Zelda overworld.

694
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,620
Speaker 1: right stuff actually happens.

695
00:43:33,782 --> 00:43:42,404
Speaker 0: So if you're a game developer The advice to take from shapes and beats is some advice that has really been making the rounds in the industry for a decade now And it's always right.

696
00:43:42,866 --> 00:43:45,820
Speaker 0: You should spend more time polishing your game than you spent making your game.

697
00:43:46,201 --> 00:43:50,460
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, I've you know, we talked about this and also spy party being so many years in development.

698
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:50,963
Speaker 1: But it's like.

699
00:43:51,264 --> 00:43:52,772
Speaker 1: that's why I have confidence.

700
00:43:52,792 --> 00:43:54,260
Speaker 1: spy party will actually be fucking good.

701
00:43:54,440 --> 00:44:01,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, although I read about what spy party is and even though it is I admit very very good It's just not a game that for me.

702
00:44:01,794 --> 00:44:04,736
Speaker 0: Well, it's good Fighter problem.

703
00:44:04,796 --> 00:44:14,745
Speaker 1: Yes The other thing I got to say is that you know The first time I learned this lesson people don't know half-life 1. most people listening this may not Remember when half-life 1 came out.

704
00:44:15,106 --> 00:44:21,769
Speaker 1: the story is real simple gave in and friends who worked at Microsoft had a bunch of fucking Money, they said well, let's make games instead.

705
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:29,736
Speaker 1: So they made half-life 1 the dream game and They it was delayed and it was hyped and delayed and hyped and delayed and hyped and delayed.

706
00:44:29,757 --> 00:44:30,880
Speaker 1: and they just said we don't now.

707
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,626
Speaker 1: So no release date.

708
00:44:31,686 --> 00:44:32,695
Speaker 1: It'll be ready when it's ready.

709
00:44:32,735 --> 00:44:39,780
Speaker 1: Fuck you and Sure enough because they spent so much time and let it be ready when it's ready and spent ages on it and delayed it forever.

710
00:44:40,243 --> 00:44:47,853
Speaker 1: When it came out in 1990, whatever the fuck late 90s It was God the game of God because they had polished that turd until it was no longer a turd.

711
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:48,314
Speaker 1: Yep.

712
00:44:48,916 --> 00:44:52,686
Speaker 0: So this game Proves that out yet again.

713
00:44:52,787 --> 00:45:02,735
Speaker 0: that polish kind of matters more than the core game As long as the core game is above a certain level of quality Yep, and the other thing to say if you're a game player This is a must play

714
00:45:02,776 --> 00:45:09,019
Speaker 1: game Yeah, and the thing I like most about this game is I feel like you know I can spend the 20 bucks play it.

715
00:45:09,100 --> 00:45:13,860
Speaker 1: I'm gonna beat the single player as soon as I sit down to actually do it Yeah, and then I won't need to play single player anymore.

716
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:17,555
Speaker 1: I'll be done, but I'll still have this great multiplayer game for any time.

717
00:45:17,635 --> 00:45:24,000
Speaker 1: a local party action Yeah, right and I tested it out on some people who you know, you think this is a kind of a hard game, right?

718
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:24,884
Speaker 1: It's one of bullet hell.

719
00:45:24,904 --> 00:45:27,820
Speaker 1: I tested it out on people who do not have bullet hell skills.

720
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:36,116
Speaker 1: They're not very good at games and they totally had fun Enjoyed the music right and had a good time and didn't die nearly as often as you would think.

721
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:37,420
Speaker 1: you would just die constantly like dead.

722
00:45:37,561 --> 00:45:38,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, did not be fun.

723
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:41,040
Speaker 1: It's like no they cuz it gives you lives.

724
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:42,949
Speaker 1: It's like you just say you take damage before you die.

725
00:45:42,989 --> 00:45:45,160
Speaker 1: It's not a one-shot kill even on hard mode.

726
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:52,801
Speaker 1: So everyone can have total like bald tons of fun with this even if you don't normally like a bullet hell Situation.

Speaker 0: so in case you think I should be saying your name And you're not make sure you didn't check the box.

742
00:47:40,433 --> 00:47:42,080
Speaker 0: that says I don't want a reward.

743
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:59,744
Speaker 0: Because if you say that you show up below the line and some people chose that because while they donate money to the patreon They do not want me to say their names on the show for whatever reason But if you want me to say your name You've got to uncheck that box and say you actually want the quote-unquote reward Also along those lines.

744
00:48:00,346 --> 00:48:02,012
Speaker 0: I'm actually spending the patreon money.

00:48:02,032 --> 00:48:04,339

748
00:48:20,221 --> 00:48:28,029
Speaker 0: Having a microphone and a podcast logo was the style of the times if the times were 2006 and I think we're past that point.
