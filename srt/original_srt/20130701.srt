1
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:12,139
Speaker 0: It's Monday July 1st 2013.

2
00:00:12,139 --> 00:00:17,809
Speaker 0: I'm rim I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight how to hide all your dirty pornography from the NSA?

3
00:00:20,382 --> 00:00:21,398
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:23,766 --> 00:00:27,857
Speaker 0: So I came home through Grand Central, which I don't do often anymore really have to.

5
00:00:27,957 --> 00:00:29,140
Speaker 1: it was a train problem today.

6
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:43,600
Speaker 0: Also, I was about to say it went away Because when I got to Grand Central the place was literally Overflowing like people were trying to walk into entrances and could not because of the severe crush of people already inside.

7
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:49,560
Speaker 0: So I basically shove my way in and start shoving my way through because I'm just trying to get down to the seven train.

8
00:00:49,580 --> 00:00:51,059
Speaker 1: in There I am the shiver robot.

9
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:55,855
Speaker 0: There are people lined up in lines that will easily take them over an hour to buy tickets.

10
00:00:56,096 --> 00:01:06,440
Speaker 0: at every ticket counter Every tickets every ticket machine on the upstairs floor had lines that were longer than lines I've seen for roller coasters and the concourse was filled with people.

11
00:01:06,942 --> 00:01:11,920
Speaker 0: Most of them were taking pictures and looked like tourists, but it was denser than I've ever in my life seen it.

12
00:01:12,243 --> 00:01:12,507
Speaker 1: You know what?

13
00:01:12,527 --> 00:01:23,773
Speaker 1: I learned the other day That you don't realize I didn't realize for years and in fact until the other day What there's a stairway and that little thing in the middle the shovel robot pushes in the pusher robot show that that was kind of the joke.

14
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:28,080
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah.

15
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:36,600
Speaker 0: So I couldn't figure out what was up But then I finally shoved my way through the crowd and I get down to the subway push a robot down there.

16
00:01:37,182 --> 00:01:39,249
Speaker 0: Yeah, because I shove down there.

17
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,219
Speaker 0: There's like four ticket machines and no people.

18
00:01:43,941 --> 00:01:45,887
Speaker 0: So I think it was mostly tourists who were in them.

19
00:01:45,988 --> 00:01:46,710
Speaker 0: I don't know what was up.

20
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:47,433
Speaker 0: It was weird.

21
00:01:47,954 --> 00:01:48,336
Speaker 0: Who knows?

22
00:01:48,677 --> 00:01:53,432
Speaker 1: Yeah Side note, which is mildly technologically related mildly.

23
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:55,139
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, we're you know, we're going to Paxos.

24
00:01:55,420 --> 00:01:59,360
Speaker 1: We'll save that for the meta moment, but I needed you know electrical conversion equipment.

25
00:01:59,982 --> 00:02:03,978
Speaker 0: I own pretty much every electrical conversion thing because of all my work travel.

26
00:02:04,219 --> 00:02:06,247
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, I bought on Amazon.

27
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:08,154
Speaker 0: the highest rated thing was the one you linked to.

28
00:02:08,235 --> 00:02:11,854
Speaker 0: is the one I bought at work Just because yeah, it adapts.

29
00:02:11,914 --> 00:02:17,554
Speaker 1: three, you know Australia's to just changes the shape of the Australian plug to the American plug.

30
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,527
Speaker 1: in fact all kinds of plugs Into Australian plug.

31
00:02:20,848 --> 00:02:27,197
Speaker 1: so you can plug all sorts of things in in Australia If you have non-australian electronic devices as long as those devices take 230 volts.

32
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:34,320
Speaker 1: Well, I thought it's so the thing is this right if you look at your electronic devices, right?

33
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,708
Speaker 1: for example a laptop with a transformer it'll say something on it like You know 110 through some number.

34
00:02:40,788 --> 00:02:43,737
Speaker 1: right and as long as you know, it's a wide enough range.

35
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:44,520
Speaker 1: You're good.

36
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,763
Speaker 0: Well most modern devices that are charging something that is in the end DC and has a little bit Wart on it.

37
00:02:52,286 --> 00:02:53,954
Speaker 0: They'll take between 110 and 240, right?

38
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,018
Speaker 1: The thing is I went and looked at all my things just to check this because I never really checked it.

39
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:07,120
Speaker 1: Recently when I travel I pretty much I mean when I last time I went to a country a different electricity For an extended period was in the year 2000.

40
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:20,480
Speaker 1: I went to Israel and I didn't bring a lot of electronic things with me that needed charging because that you know, even now I 2000 I bring like laptop Cellphone maybe Kindle everything mostly charges with USB.

41
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:24,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, I'm gonna bring more stuff to this than any other country ever been to it.

42
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:31,140
Speaker 1: Anyway, I noticed the 3ds an essential traveling electronic the AC adapter.

43
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,514
Speaker 1: No, no supporting foreign country voltage.

44
00:03:34,534 --> 00:03:46,557
Speaker 0: No, no That's the only one of all the ones that I checked like my camera battery chargers and everything is the only one Looked on Amazon like oh duh I'll make fun of you and be like look you could buy one for five bucks.

45
00:03:46,798 --> 00:03:50,091
Speaker 0: now All the ones I can find are not actually available for sale.

46
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:50,552
Speaker 1: Yep.

47
00:03:50,592 --> 00:03:51,235
Speaker 0: They're all sold out.

48
00:03:51,255 --> 00:03:52,680
Speaker 1: You know what I did buy an Amazon.

49
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:53,429
Speaker 0: what'd you buy?

50
00:03:53,449 --> 00:03:59,960
Speaker 1: a 3ds charger that is nothing more than a USB cable with a 3ds plug at the other end.

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:05,496
Speaker 1: That is a much better idea cuz I just have to friggin get USB out of something else.

52
00:04:05,576 --> 00:04:06,358
Speaker 1: Oh, here's all that.

53
00:04:06,619 --> 00:04:06,840
Speaker 1: what?

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,247
Speaker 0: Really all right.

55
00:04:09,367 --> 00:04:11,016
Speaker 0: on Amazon there is one guy selling.

56
00:04:11,298 --> 00:04:14,670
Speaker 0: that's eBay Yeah, but it was linked to from Amazon.

57
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:17,178
Speaker 0: Anyway, I don't know anyway.

58
00:04:17,378 --> 00:04:17,699
Speaker 1: anyway.

59
00:04:19,361 --> 00:04:21,228
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't know how much I'll use my 3ds there.

60
00:04:21,267 --> 00:04:24,680
Speaker 0: I'm mostly gonna be playing tabletop games and console games.

61
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:32,849
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I'm saying if I drain it on the plane and I'm gonna be there, you know Mostly sleep on the plane when I'm not sleeping.

62
00:04:32,869 --> 00:04:35,119
Speaker 0: I'm gonna try to read and review the panel.

63
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:38,910
Speaker 1: shit Yeah, but it's gonna be fucking like 24 hours on the plane.

64
00:04:39,010 --> 00:04:42,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's plenty of time to do those things and have time left over.

65
00:04:43,521 --> 00:04:46,051
Speaker 0: Actually, I'm gonna try to finish all my typing for bean town.

66
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:46,433
Speaker 1: Yeah.

67
00:04:46,513 --> 00:04:48,040
Speaker 1: Also, what about the plane back?

68
00:04:48,821 --> 00:04:52,137
Speaker 0: I'll just sleep the whole time about 12 24 hours chilly sleeping now.

69
00:04:52,178 --> 00:04:52,660
Speaker 0: I can do that.

70
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:55,575
Speaker 0: I'll just get super drunk and fall asleep and then I'll wake up at home.

71
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:58,952
Speaker 0: you wake up in New York I'll wake up in LA and I miss my connecting flight.

72
00:04:59,234 --> 00:04:59,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, okay.

73
00:04:59,837 --> 00:05:00,280
Speaker 1: It's all you.

74
00:05:00,822 --> 00:05:04,400
Speaker 1: I'm gonna play some video games at least part of that time for some hours.

75
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:09,160
Speaker 0: So a thing in New York for many of you who don't realize, you know, I bike to work almost every day.

76
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,911
Speaker 0: it's got bikes to work Emily even bikes to work.

77
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:16,214
Speaker 0: a lot of us bike to work because it's Biking is faster than the subway unless you're going.

78
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:17,560
Speaker 1: is it still an opening bit?

79
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:20,400
Speaker 1: Because these are things that we've talked about in opening but it's like a hundred times.

80
00:05:22,042 --> 00:05:23,856
Speaker 0: I'm going to review some technology.

81
00:05:23,876 --> 00:05:24,400
Speaker 0: I've been using.

82
00:05:26,062 --> 00:05:28,573
Speaker 0: My trouble is I have an expensive bike.

83
00:05:28,593 --> 00:05:30,160
Speaker 0: It would be a felony to steal it.

84
00:05:30,823 --> 00:05:34,340
Speaker 0: However, New York City is the bike steel in a city in America.

85
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,649
Speaker 0: nay, the Western Hemisphere nay the universe.

86
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:46,315
Speaker 0: seriously people steal bikes so frequently especially in Manhattan that basically I can't leave my bike anywhere

87
00:05:46,516 --> 00:05:48,991
Speaker 1: unless it's inside Knox like in

88
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:59,695
Speaker 0: New York is fine But if I want to bike out to lunch in Manhattan There is literally nothing you could say that would convince me and my bike will be safe for more than 30 seconds out of my sight No matter how many chains I put on it.

89
00:05:59,917 --> 00:06:00,099
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

90
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:04,954
Speaker 0: So I actually signed up for city bike which you know CITI.

91
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:08,839
Speaker 0: it's the sort of bike share program That's being set up in New York City.

92
00:06:09,181 --> 00:06:15,120
Speaker 0: It's in Manhattan a South of 59th Street and it's in Dumbo and some areas like right over the bridge in Brooklyn.

93
00:06:15,783 --> 00:06:17,250
Speaker 0: It's this thing where you get a little card.

94
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,359
Speaker 0: It's got a little RFID or something in it.

95
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:20,445
Speaker 0: It's on my keychain.

96
00:06:20,526 --> 00:06:22,820
Speaker 0: I stick it in and then I just immediately take a bike.

97
00:06:23,483 --> 00:06:37,358
Speaker 0: I get a 45 minutes take that bike wherever I want But as long as I put it back into another station before the end of that 45 minutes I don't have to pay anything and if I go over it's like 250 for another 45 minutes or whatever.

98
00:06:37,378 --> 00:06:37,739
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

99
00:06:38,441 --> 00:06:43,860
Speaker 0: So I don't have any by our apartments so I can't use it to bike all the way home.

100
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,750
Speaker 0: But I basically got it as an experiment and to kind of support this thing.

101
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:49,500
Speaker 0: So thus my review of this technology.

102
00:06:50,715 --> 00:06:55,501
Speaker 0: one These gear these bikes are steel framed Monsters.

103
00:06:55,923 --> 00:07:00,920
Speaker 0: they weigh about as much as all those bullshit bikes that we see people riding in other countries.

104
00:07:03,662 --> 00:07:07,856
Speaker 0: They weigh like 45 pounds if I had to guess by picking one up.

105
00:07:08,258 --> 00:07:13,796
Speaker 0: they are Massive - the brakes don't work for shit shitty brakes.

106
00:07:13,816 --> 00:07:13,937
Speaker 1: Huh?

107
00:07:13,977 --> 00:07:14,920
Speaker 1: What kind of brakes are they?

108
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,140
Speaker 0: They're kind of obscured but they're like linear pull just hand brakes.

109
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,608
Speaker 1: But usually those are pretty powerful.

110
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:25,180
Speaker 1: linear pull has a you know with them with the properly Calibrated levers is like actually like the strongest braking force.

111
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,560
Speaker 0: I'm suspecting part of the reason they are so terrible is that I get this thing going.

112
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:34,036
Speaker 0: It's so heavy max speed and here momentum.

113
00:07:34,237 --> 00:07:35,846
Speaker 1: Yep, mass Three.

114
00:07:36,531 --> 00:07:45,000
Speaker 0: the seats are pretty well inertia But just because of the way they're kind of kitted out the first time I rode one I actually hurt my back kind of badly.

115
00:07:45,502 --> 00:07:49,540
Speaker 1: Well, it's got sort of a derpy seat right and you gotta adjust the height of the seat.

116
00:07:49,981 --> 00:07:56,830
Speaker 0: But I had to stand up and kind of pump it to get going in you and I basically because in the wild gear I'll get to that.

117
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:04,260
Speaker 0: Okay, so Because of how heavy and slow they are It's really hard to get them going in a reasonable span again.

118
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:07,580
Speaker 0: I get like run with it and then jump onto it and you can't just start going.

119
00:08:08,105 --> 00:08:09,760
Speaker 0: So I used to when I first saw him on the streets.

120
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:17,020
Speaker 0: I'd make fun of people in my mind Because I'd see everyone on a city bike like a wobble to a stop and then a wobble every time they started.

121
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:20,965
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wobble too on these fuckers The gears.

122
00:08:21,448 --> 00:08:23,760
Speaker 1: so it has a three-speed Shimano hub, right?

123
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:26,289
Speaker 0: Yeah Yes three speed hub big hub gears.

124
00:08:26,349 --> 00:08:34,299
Speaker 0: now some people in the forum have been trying to Maintain that hub gears are in any way currently a reasonable replacement for a standard.

125
00:08:34,339 --> 00:08:39,038
Speaker 1: do When I see a hub gear in the Tour de France, then we'll talk.

126
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:57,900
Speaker 0: now Aside from the fact that not there aren't really many hub gear systems that have the same maximum ratio as my dear idea Hub gears in my experience suck balls and the ones in the city bikes suck more balls than the ones I am used to.

127
00:08:58,543 --> 00:09:01,120
Speaker 0: They only have three speeds which in America is actually the standard.

128
00:09:01,201 --> 00:09:03,580
Speaker 0: It's very rare to see a hub gear that has more than three speeds.

129
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,320
Speaker 1: Well, really, you know if you have three speeds, that's actually sort of enough for New York City, right?

130
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,950
Speaker 1: There isn't really too many places you're gonna need.

131
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:13,680
Speaker 1: I mean if you have five you're really set for the city.

132
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,147
Speaker 1: There's no giant hills.

133
00:09:15,509 --> 00:09:18,688
Speaker 1: the biggest till I can think of is the back of Central Park Which you should be able to get.

134
00:09:18,709 --> 00:09:28,933
Speaker 0: so in casual riding I'll get it to the top gear and then I have to just stop pedaling because I'm pedaling at my max cadence and There is no way for me to pedal.

135
00:09:28,973 --> 00:09:34,100
Speaker 0: to make the bike go faster It needs it needs two more gears, really.

136
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:45,078
Speaker 0: But luckily for the kinds of riding that it's intended for like go out to lunch go to the grocery store The three gears are kind of adequate, but it's very frustrating to use the hub gear system.

137
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:50,120
Speaker 0: one Despite what people tell you hub gears do not immediately shift.

138
00:09:51,082 --> 00:09:57,830
Speaker 0: Now they people claim that most hub gears have an advantage where you can shift and keep pedaling You don't have to worry about like letting up on the tension.

139
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:59,416
Speaker 1: Well, that's also true.

140
00:09:59,436 --> 00:10:05,920
Speaker 1: There's certain Derailleur gears where the teeth on the cogs or a certain shape mine has this where you can just keep pedaling.

141
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:07,501
Speaker 0: Pedaling.

142
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:19,839
Speaker 0: however, it is best practice and pretty much every bike to continue pedaling but very slightly lessen up on the forward Pressure against that little bit, you know when you feel that point where it catches in the ratchet

143
00:10:20,201 --> 00:10:20,362
Speaker 1: Mmm,

144
00:10:20,763 --> 00:10:36,499
Speaker 0: you basically want to let up a tiny bit right when it shifts, but with did it is when you shift You especially in modern bikes with the sort of trigger shifters you get this two-step where you push the thing and there's a click And then you have this like moment where you let go and you can time it really well.

145
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:46,730
Speaker 0: Hub gears you twist it and then at some point in the next like one point seven five rotations It kind of starts for a second and then it's in the other gear.

146
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:53,040
Speaker 0: there's a significant noticeable annoying delay in shifting Mmm, especially on these cheap hub gears.

147
00:10:54,241 --> 00:11:09,619
Speaker 0: Also because it's a twist gear and there's no sort of two-step like I'm used to and because it's really easy to twist it I guess because people might have trouble with it If you if you are riding the bike, it is very easy just accidentally shift into the easiest gear and then basically destroy your nutsack.

148
00:11:11,324 --> 00:11:12,980
Speaker 0: That happened to me like seven times.

149
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:22,889
Speaker 0: I'm an experienced biker and I'm I'm even used to having bikes with these stupid hubs and these stupid twist shifters and everything They ride, you know what they ride like.

150
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:34,420
Speaker 0: if I had to describe the what is like riding a bike like this It's like riding the kind of motorcycle or motorbike that you give a 13 year old in the Midwest Like I had a motorbike every kid anyway.

151
00:11:35,045 --> 00:11:38,627
Speaker 0: Yeah, they'll go like maybe 15 miles an hour.

152
00:11:38,627 --> 00:11:39,712
Speaker 0: 20 if you like.

153
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:45,263
Speaker 0: put the throttle all the way like power wheels Step up from power wheels Power wheels.

154
00:11:45,504 --> 00:11:47,412
Speaker 0: I believe you mean pow pow power.

155
00:11:47,432 --> 00:11:49,520
Speaker 1: Well, I was discussing a car power wheels.

156
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:52,096
Speaker 1: That's why I went to power with the power book.

157
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:58,346
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah in conclusion I Did some experimentation.

158
00:11:58,627 --> 00:12:00,373
Speaker 0: I biked basically home.

159
00:12:00,393 --> 00:12:01,236
Speaker 0: I couldn't bike all the way home.

160
00:12:01,256 --> 00:12:05,754
Speaker 0: So I biked to Grand Central Multiple days with a city bike from my office.

161
00:12:06,096 --> 00:12:14,213
Speaker 0: It takes me 28 minutes from when I start pedaling to when I'm in front of my apartment building Which is you know, not that bad.

162
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:22,359
Speaker 0: It took me 32 minutes on average to bike just to Grand Central, which is only two-thirds of the way home.

163
00:12:23,021 --> 00:12:37,780
Speaker 0: Mmm, the lack of efficiency due to the combination of shitty gears extreme weight terrible tires Basically makes me Significantly slower to the point that it adds 15 plus minutes to my average commute home.

164
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,786
Speaker 1: That's a half hour a day.

165
00:12:38,806 --> 00:12:39,410
Speaker 1: You're losing there.

166
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:44,179
Speaker 0: If you were gonna use city bike to go all the way home Yeah You really can't use city bike to go more than a mile or two.

167
00:12:44,762 --> 00:12:49,440
Speaker 1: I think that's what I think really the best use of it is simply to extend subway stops, right exactly.

168
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:55,700
Speaker 1: There are people who live close to a subway but not close enough that they can really walk there in the morning.

169
00:12:56,501 --> 00:12:57,747
Speaker 1: So those people own cars.

170
00:12:57,908 --> 00:13:03,809
Speaker 0: you imagine you if there's a city bike thing in front of your apartment To walk to the subway, but it still takes a few minutes.

171
00:13:04,171 --> 00:13:10,471
Speaker 1: if I could take a city bike to the subway station from my Apartment, it would take like five minutes not even less like two minutes like whoosh.

172
00:13:10,511 --> 00:13:20,232
Speaker 1: you're there instantly and that would be a huge Convenience and thus people who lived even further away from the subway Could get to the station in the same time.

173
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:21,860
Speaker 1: It takes me to walk to the station.

174
00:13:22,241 --> 00:13:32,620
Speaker 1: Currently they have to own a car where they live, you know, maybe along the Hudson or you know way north Distoria or way northeast closer to LaGuardia like the Steinway type people.

175
00:13:32,961 --> 00:13:37,080
Speaker 1: It's like they're you know, kind of a little far away for the subway station, but they had a bike.

176
00:13:37,602 --> 00:13:39,892
Speaker 1: You know that they could just not worry about getting stolen.

177
00:13:39,912 --> 00:13:42,920
Speaker 1: if they leave it at the subway station all day They'd be all set.

178
00:13:43,129 --> 00:13:43,340
Speaker 0: Yeah.

179
00:13:43,842 --> 00:13:46,250
Speaker 0: so the other the cool technological things they do one the pot.

180
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:50,867
Speaker 0: the stations where you get them are kind of solar-powered and they Basically just have car batteries in them.

181
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:53,800
Speaker 0: I saw a guy replacing him like just normal car batteries.

182
00:13:54,021 --> 00:13:58,914
Speaker 0: Yep, and despite all the news articles that keep talking about the system being super unreliable.

183
00:13:59,175 --> 00:14:00,639
Speaker 0: I've literally never had a problem.

184
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,253
Speaker 0: Mmm And the key is the way.

185
00:14:03,333 --> 00:14:08,179
Speaker 0: the best part about it Is that literally you walk up you put your little key in you just immediately take the bike.

186
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:11,190
Speaker 0: When you're done, you just shove it in turns green you're done.

187
00:14:11,571 --> 00:14:15,582
Speaker 0: the fact that they made it that easy and that quick is great All right.

188
00:14:15,823 --> 00:14:17,188
Speaker 0: So yeah, that's the technology.

189
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:18,995
Speaker 0: hub gears suck.

190
00:14:19,256 --> 00:14:26,560
Speaker 0: They're not there yet Maybe someday, but there are physical and mechanical limitations of how good a hub gear can be.

191
00:14:27,405 --> 00:14:32,351
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean look I used to be like, yeah I don't need that fancy road lands Armstrong bike, right.

192
00:14:32,753 --> 00:14:39,435
Speaker 1: and then I rode one and I was like Oh you pedal like once and you're going 30 and you barely had to put any effort into it.

193
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:40,318
Speaker 1: That is crazy.

194
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:47,197
Speaker 0: yesterday I rode a city bike to Grand Central, but then when I was home or no, I love Friday whatever day it was.

195
00:14:47,478 --> 00:14:54,839
Speaker 0: and then I Later got on my own bike and went riding and it it was almost I felt like my normal bike was magic.

196
00:14:57,808 --> 00:14:58,559
Speaker 1: All right news.

197
00:15:00,183 --> 00:15:00,837
Speaker 1: So, yeah.

198
00:15:02,201 --> 00:15:05,755
Speaker 1: So I read this really interesting story today about somebody who scammed.

199
00:15:05,856 --> 00:15:06,839
Speaker 1: read it, right?

200
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:08,024
Speaker 1: It's like and read it.

201
00:15:08,144 --> 00:15:11,680
Speaker 1: so, you know the site quick meme where you can make memes real easily.

202
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:21,023
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I use that site kind of often Right, so you should stop using it because basically what happened is long story short guy who works in that site One of the people who owns it Scammed.

203
00:15:21,104 --> 00:15:22,151
Speaker 0: Oh, no, I don't use quick meme.

204
00:15:22,211 --> 00:15:23,480
Speaker 0: I use a different similar site.

205
00:15:23,621 --> 00:15:26,835
Speaker 1: Oh, well, you're not gonna use that different similar site either when I'm done with the story all right.

206
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:43,899
Speaker 1: So he somehow became perhaps through a rigged election a moderator of our advice animals which is pretty much meme central and he was you know, basically voted up all the quick memes and down voted all the posts that were using competitors to quick meme and such-and-such.

207
00:15:44,616 --> 00:15:44,759
Speaker 1: right.

208
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:53,060
Speaker 1: Eventually through much investigation that is quite interesting and described in this article He was found out and quick meme was banned from reddit.

209
00:15:53,321 --> 00:16:11,479
Speaker 1: and even if it gets unbanned from reddit, it will never be unbanned from advice animals and The guys kind of scummy and it shows you yeah, he was trying to you know, he was afraid of competition He was trying to beat them through devious means but ended up Defeating himself because he was being shady and the internet doesn't take to that shit like the real world does.

210
00:16:11,721 --> 00:16:11,882
Speaker 1: My maker.

211
00:16:11,902 --> 00:16:12,445
Speaker 1: I use now your guy.

212
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:16,507
Speaker 1: I'm gonna tell you which one you're using.

213
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:24,779
Speaker 1: starting now because I learned in this article that yeah You know, there was quick meme and the competitor that they were trying to beat was live meme, right?

214
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,694
Speaker 1: Which is the one they were worried about because it had better features than they had.

215
00:16:27,714 --> 00:16:28,639
Speaker 1: Yeah, but you know what?

216
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:33,383
Speaker 1: Imgur now makes memes so Done and done.

217
00:16:33,584 --> 00:16:35,429
Speaker 0: Well what I've been doing now, what's follow?

218
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:35,951
Speaker 0: I used to.

219
00:16:36,091 --> 00:16:38,820
Speaker 0: I used meme generator dot nets.

220
00:16:39,281 --> 00:16:40,726
Speaker 1: Yeah, just use it by Imgur.

221
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:44,118
Speaker 0: now the way I used meme generator dot net because they have a good sort of.

222
00:16:44,138 --> 00:16:46,195
Speaker 0: they actually have a good internal ranking system.

223
00:16:46,215 --> 00:16:50,235
Speaker 0: I Make my meme and then I drag it into my anger account.

224
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:52,306
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, that's what most people do.

225
00:16:52,346 --> 00:16:55,380
Speaker 1: but Imgur now has a mean thing so you don't need to use anything else.

226
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,539
Speaker 1: That's has a bad user interface and it's of course already on Imgur.

227
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,467
Speaker 1: Well, you're starting right now using Imgur me.

228
00:17:04,667 --> 00:17:09,826
Speaker 1: I practice use a random one every time maybe but for now on You can use the Imgur one.

229
00:17:09,846 --> 00:17:10,771
Speaker 1: Oh my gosh.

230
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:17,375
Speaker 1: And yeah, this story is really interesting To show you know, just how you cannot scam your way around reddit and such.

231
00:17:17,395 --> 00:17:20,598
Speaker 1: I was pretty fascinated by the detective process.

232
00:17:22,222 --> 00:17:23,945
Speaker 0: Well, I know reddit does crazy stuff like.

233
00:17:23,965 --> 00:17:29,623
Speaker 0: you'll get down votes in some proportion to your up votes so that but they can do And they.

234
00:17:30,048 --> 00:17:31,140
Speaker 0: other forums have done this before.

235
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:35,099
Speaker 0: I've actually toyed with the idea of making a vanilla plug-in to do this if no one already did.

236
00:17:35,761 --> 00:17:46,371
Speaker 0: But they'll do things like that to obscure well the effect of your up-and-down votes so that if you make a spam bot and it's caught The spam bot won't know that it's not affecting anything.

237
00:17:46,551 --> 00:17:52,020
Speaker 0: This is this is not even close to anything related to that No, but I'm saying like there's clever stuff that goes on in these sites.

238
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,711
Speaker 1: I'm sure there might be yeah, but this has nothing to do with that.

239
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:56,860
Speaker 1: This is a guy who was gaming the system.

240
00:17:57,381 --> 00:17:58,102
Speaker 1: He's a moderator.

241
00:18:04,195 --> 00:18:06,680
Speaker 0: But anyway things of the day.

242
00:18:07,264 --> 00:18:09,540
Speaker 0: So I've been on a civil war kick lately.

243
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:10,064
Speaker 0: I don't know why.

244
00:18:10,144 --> 00:18:18,986
Speaker 0: maybe I'm just old enough and as far as I can tell Every man in America or at least someone who identifies as the gender male The older they get the more interested.

245
00:18:19,026 --> 00:18:21,736
Speaker 0: they get in the Civil War for some reason not me.

246
00:18:22,037 --> 00:18:23,000
Speaker 0: You're not old enough yet.

247
00:18:23,141 --> 00:18:24,271
Speaker 1: I'm more interested in trains.

248
00:18:24,392 --> 00:18:25,119
Speaker 0: This has just been my.

249
00:18:25,341 --> 00:18:37,920
Speaker 0: Maybe it's just my experience But every relative I've known a lot of the adult as time goes on the Civil War and particularly like the Ken Burns Documentaries and all that stuff just becomes more and more a part of their lives.

250
00:18:38,841 --> 00:18:42,740
Speaker 0: Okay, but also Crash Course finally got to the Civil War.

251
00:18:43,041 --> 00:18:46,220
Speaker 1: Oh, I still haven't watched any of that nor have I watched that British show with the peasant and such.

252
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:49,340
Speaker 0: Oh my god, the Crash Course is way better than the peasant.

253
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,088
Speaker 1: I haven't watched any one of those.

254
00:18:51,128 --> 00:18:53,660
Speaker 0: You should they're great, but he finally got up to the Civil War.

255
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:57,404
Speaker 0: The thing he doesn't talk about is the battles and the bullshit He just talks about.

256
00:18:57,465 --> 00:19:00,420
Speaker 0: you know, the politics and the society the consequences nice.

257
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:10,899
Speaker 0: So for anyone who actually cares about the details of these battles like, you know war gamers and grog nards This is actually a super awesome site civil war org.

258
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:17,719
Speaker 0: But they have a thing that I'm linking to the Battle of Shiloh for And if you don't know what the Battle of Shiloh was then I guess you're not old enough.

259
00:19:18,580 --> 00:19:28,514
Speaker 0: basically what they do is they take you through kind of the chronological progression of Every individual major battle in the Civil War like move for move.

260
00:19:28,554 --> 00:19:29,517
Speaker 0: this army went here.

261
00:19:29,577 --> 00:19:30,460
Speaker 0: this army moved here.

262
00:19:30,761 --> 00:19:31,684
Speaker 0: These guys did this.

263
00:19:31,925 --> 00:19:32,868
Speaker 0: this guy got shot.

264
00:19:33,289 --> 00:19:34,353
Speaker 0: this happened that happened.

265
00:19:34,614 --> 00:19:35,115
Speaker 0: It's over.

266
00:19:35,457 --> 00:19:36,420
Speaker 0: Here's pictures of bodies.

267
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,391
Speaker 0: all right, they're just really really well put together.

268
00:19:40,852 --> 00:19:48,285
Speaker 0: and considering that we just overturned the Most important part of the Voting Rights Act Mostly in the south in Texas.

269
00:19:48,727 --> 00:19:49,048
Speaker 0: I don't know.

270
00:19:49,128 --> 00:19:50,672
Speaker 0: two hours later pass there.

271
00:19:50,953 --> 00:19:53,259
Speaker 0: Let's not let poor and black people vote anymore law.

272
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:57,412
Speaker 1: So, yeah, let's go to war with them.

273
00:19:57,452 --> 00:19:58,094
Speaker 1: they won't win.

274
00:19:58,376 --> 00:19:59,079
Speaker 1: right history.

275
00:20:00,284 --> 00:20:02,059
Speaker 1: One thing we learn from the Civil War will win.

276
00:20:02,442 --> 00:20:03,448
Speaker 0: So just the two thing.

277
00:20:03,469 --> 00:20:12,338
Speaker 0: the reason I made this my thing of the day one Never forget the Civil War was pretty much just about slavery and at the Alamo we were kind of the bad guys.

278
00:20:12,619 --> 00:20:23,118
Speaker 0: Yes second thing to never forget the Civil War was actually crazily advanced compared to warfare in the rest of the world at its time.

279
00:20:23,139 --> 00:20:36,238
Speaker 0: and The reason the main reason that World War one was as horrifying as it was is because the entire world Ignored the American Civil War and didn't learn anything from what happened over here.

280
00:20:36,258 --> 00:20:39,020
Speaker 1: Nope No one cared about this.

281
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:42,039
Speaker 1: I mean how much do you know about civil wars and other countries besides the

282
00:20:42,099 --> 00:20:42,140
Speaker 1: u.s.?

283
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,704
Speaker 1: Let's think about civil wars.

284
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:45,991
Speaker 1: is that other countries don't learn about other countries?

285
00:20:46,031 --> 00:20:51,002
Speaker 0: civil wars - I learned a lot about the Civil War in Britain Mm-hmm.

286
00:20:51,424 --> 00:20:55,920
Speaker 0: I also learned a lot about these sort of on again off again civil wars within France.

287
00:20:56,722 --> 00:21:03,920
Speaker 1: Not once in the my history classes ever did they teach us about a civil war other than the American Civil War.

288
00:21:04,563 --> 00:21:08,302
Speaker 0: Aspects of partition were very reeking of civil wars Mm-hmm.

289
00:21:08,904 --> 00:21:14,920
Speaker 0: Anyway, the you're it but pointedly European generals ignore like if they had just paid attention to what happened over here.

290
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,957
Speaker 0: They kind of looked at America like this backwater and like oh the Americans are fighting.

291
00:21:18,997 --> 00:21:19,700
Speaker 0: Let him fight it out.

292
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:25,687
Speaker 0: we have our own, you know, big boy European stuff to do and History kind of glosses over that.

293
00:21:26,129 --> 00:21:29,160
Speaker 0: basically modern warfare began with the American Civil War.

294
00:21:29,861 --> 00:21:40,136
Speaker 1: hmm, anyway, so thing of the day a lot of times, you know various products will Cooperate with licensed properties to promote their products.

295
00:21:40,177 --> 00:21:43,107
Speaker 1: For example Hello Kitty band-aid.

296
00:21:43,227 --> 00:21:44,874
Speaker 1: What does Hello Kitty had to do with band-aids?

297
00:21:45,256 --> 00:21:46,139
Speaker 0: Not fucking much.

298
00:21:46,581 --> 00:22:03,360
Speaker 1: But if you like Hello Kitty and you need band-aids that might convince you to buy a Hello Kitty band-aid instead of a regular band-aid But sometimes once in a blue moon Such a partnership promotion deal just makes fucking sense in a glorious fashion.

299
00:22:04,186 --> 00:22:10,570
Speaker 1: As I present to you the Star Wars Pocky promotion Lightsaber Pocky the end.

300
00:22:10,993 --> 00:22:15,537
Speaker 1: watch these videos, duh Really no, they're really crazy.

301
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:19,940
Speaker 1: I'm going to the gross Japanese grocery to get pretty much everything on the list.

302
00:22:21,222 --> 00:22:21,944
Speaker 1: I'm sure they'll have it.

303
00:22:22,747 --> 00:22:36,842
Speaker 0: So in the meta moment, the book club book is Stasi Land a series of short non-true stories About what it was like to live in East Germany and deal with the Stasi and that whole, you know Awful.

304
00:22:37,143 --> 00:22:45,120
Speaker 0: that horrifying era that a lot of people don't seem to really think too much about Considering the majority of Americans are totally okay with the NSA has been up to lately.

305
00:22:45,602 --> 00:22:52,700
Speaker 1: It was really bad not quite as bad as Nazi times But still really bad and not quite we have it better.

306
00:22:52,881 --> 00:22:55,190
Speaker 1: But that doesn't mean that what we have is good either.

307
00:22:55,210 --> 00:23:03,720
Speaker 0: where you're going to be at not neck not this weekend But next weekend kinetic on not only running the panels department, but doing a smorgasbord of panel.

308
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,986
Speaker 1: We could have time to do panels if we're running panels.

309
00:23:06,006 --> 00:23:07,410
Speaker 0: Oh, well, we'll manage that.

310
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:09,435
Speaker 1: Okay, and we've been managed before.

311
00:23:09,756 --> 00:23:16,974
Speaker 0: then that next weekend We're gonna be in Melbourne Australia presenting Beyond Dungeons & Dragons on Friday at 1 p.m.

313
00:23:29,021 --> 00:23:33,659
Speaker 0: We are did looks like we're going to do is within a month or two.

314
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:36,871
Speaker 0: You're like the fuck if we go to dev as well.

315
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:38,960
Speaker 0: That means in the last two years.

316
00:23:39,462 --> 00:23:39,924
Speaker 0: So think about it.

317
00:23:40,105 --> 00:23:52,371
Speaker 0: in a two-year span it was Prime East Prime Dev East OS Prime Dev One two three four five six seven packs.

318
00:23:52,391 --> 00:23:53,995
Speaker 0: to God too many packs.

319
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,379
Speaker 0: is or not enough faxes?

320
00:23:55,781 --> 00:23:56,805
Speaker 1: Definitely not enough bag.

321
00:23:56,865 --> 00:23:59,957
Speaker 0: Probably be doing a lecture that we're entitling bad games.

322
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:08,099
Speaker 1: I'm kind of upset because I don't think I'll be able to go to unless some lottery happens Which is not gonna cuz I don't buy tickets won't be able to go to all us every year.

323
00:24:08,381 --> 00:24:09,404
Speaker 1: We go to Oz next year.

324
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:10,769
Speaker 1: So it's gonna be the first packs.

325
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:15,603
Speaker 1: I miss since oh wait, most likely will be packs OS 2014.

326
00:24:15,603 --> 00:24:17,833
Speaker 0: well, we didn't go to the first packs dev.

327
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:19,160
Speaker 0: we went to the second one.

328
00:24:19,461 --> 00:24:21,189
Speaker 1: That's true, but I don't really.

329
00:24:21,229 --> 00:24:22,877
Speaker 1: pegs dev is different from a pegs.

330
00:24:23,379 --> 00:24:27,891
Speaker 0: true I enjoy as some aspects of pegs dev more than some aspects of packs.

331
00:24:28,132 --> 00:24:31,320
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm case in point pegs dev does not have an expo hall.

332
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:34,679
Speaker 0: Uh-huh pegs dev gives us coffee.

333
00:24:36,001 --> 00:24:40,080
Speaker 1: And are you saying that the next when you go to pegs OS you're not gonna go the expo hall at all?

334
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:40,723
Speaker 1: Cuz you don't like it.

335
00:24:41,265 --> 00:24:42,772
Speaker 0: I will walk through it once as I do.

336
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:47,326
Speaker 0: That's what I do as well, but the Never forget.

337
00:24:47,487 --> 00:24:48,112
Speaker 0: that's been my thing.

338
00:24:48,152 --> 00:24:59,740
Speaker 0: I guess today never forget Never forget that there was a convention we went to once and that convention had a policy of free beer free unlimited beer for all attendees for the entire weekend.

339
00:25:00,463 --> 00:25:04,280
Speaker 0: And that convention was the same convention that Neil Gaiman told his stories that we met.

340
00:25:05,063 --> 00:25:09,380
Speaker 0: Steve Jackson didn't know who he was blew him off and wouldn't let him play set.

341
00:25:09,561 --> 00:25:11,150
Speaker 1: How many times are we gonna tell this story?

342
00:25:11,713 --> 00:25:15,877
Speaker 0: And that was penguin con free beer.

343
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:25,563
Speaker 0: So we're not going to pretend we know Exactly what the NSA has been up to because we don't We.

344
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:30,218
Speaker 0: all we know from what's been leaked so far is that they're collecting metadata and using that.

345
00:25:30,238 --> 00:25:36,119
Speaker 0: I Started to realize I think a lot of people don't really understand What's going on?

346
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,911
Speaker 0: And what the scandal is with Snowden and the NSA and the leaks and everything.

347
00:25:40,533 --> 00:25:45,257
Speaker 0: more importantly all the people I know who do care Really don't know what to do about it.

348
00:25:46,041 --> 00:25:52,720
Speaker 1: Well, I mean because it's actually the people who are technologically competent and understand what's going on have known about this forever.

349
00:25:52,821 --> 00:25:55,843
Speaker 1: That's why most of us were like, uh Yeah And it's I was like.

350
00:25:56,124 --> 00:26:06,120
Speaker 1: it was so weird to me that like I basically have seen this same news story Hundreds of times before like government has a crazy carnivore program spying on everybody on the internet.

351
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:16,299
Speaker 1: echelon, yeah AT&T Unwarned no warrant wiretaps from the government, you know, oh my god, and it's like busy, you know Patriot Act this news.

352
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:25,499
Speaker 1: This is like the 30th time I've seen this news in the past decade and only nerds freaked out the first few times and then nerds were like Yeah business as usual.

353
00:26:25,741 --> 00:26:34,218
Speaker 1: Well nerds are pretty much the only people who ever freak out about things and for some reason this time the same exact news Comes around again, and I saw it and I was like up same news as always.

354
00:26:34,278 --> 00:26:40,640
Speaker 1: All right I didn't really think much of it and then it was Exploding even into the regular news for days and days and days and I'm like what?

355
00:26:41,461 --> 00:26:42,265
Speaker 1: Why is this?

356
00:26:42,365 --> 00:26:43,752
Speaker 1: Why is this special?

357
00:26:43,812 --> 00:26:44,013
Speaker 1: What?

358
00:26:44,154 --> 00:26:46,784
Speaker 1: I think the difference is one Why didn't you freak out last time?

359
00:26:46,804 --> 00:26:56,914
Speaker 0: the average person basically ignores anything nerds freak out about on the internet of course So and also the average person ignores what activists freak out about.

360
00:26:56,974 --> 00:27:06,856
Speaker 0: so when a lot of smart people were Protesting the Patriot Act and marching and doing all their political activism about it The average person said what are those hippies up to whatever?

361
00:27:06,896 --> 00:27:10,567
Speaker 0: therefore I'm against And a lot of people were also against.

362
00:27:10,728 --> 00:27:11,430
Speaker 1: hippies are for them.

363
00:27:11,470 --> 00:27:14,240
Speaker 0: hippies kind of okay with the Patriot Act.

364
00:27:14,381 --> 00:27:17,196
Speaker 0: I'm still not okay with it, but at the same time.

365
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:17,618
Speaker 0: What do I do?

366
00:27:18,381 --> 00:27:18,824
Speaker 0: What not?

367
00:27:18,884 --> 00:27:21,699
Speaker 0: vote for the people who voted for it, then I can't vote for anyone.

368
00:27:22,601 --> 00:27:23,667
Speaker 1: Your vote will not matter.

369
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:24,491
Speaker 1: Not that it matters.

370
00:27:24,551 --> 00:27:25,717
Speaker 1: Anyway, please we vote for mayor.

371
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:26,200
Speaker 1: that matters.

372
00:27:26,401 --> 00:27:27,185
Speaker 0: Yeah, we can't.

373
00:27:27,286 --> 00:27:29,919
Speaker 0: actually our mirror a gonna heat up three crappy choices.

374
00:27:30,562 --> 00:27:33,132
Speaker 1: We have some crap some crappier than others like you want to.

375
00:27:33,313 --> 00:27:33,835
Speaker 1: you want to vote for.

376
00:27:33,855 --> 00:27:34,940
Speaker 1: the rent is too damn high.

377
00:27:35,425 --> 00:27:36,680
Speaker 0: Do you know who's running?

378
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:38,604
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's.

379
00:27:38,825 --> 00:27:39,910
Speaker 1: I forget her name when.

380
00:27:40,030 --> 00:27:41,979
Speaker 0: yeah, you know anything about her.

381
00:27:43,481 --> 00:27:45,428
Speaker 1: She's very liberal awesome kind of person.

382
00:27:45,468 --> 00:27:46,030
Speaker 0: in general.

383
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:47,073
Speaker 0: who else is running?

384
00:27:47,093 --> 00:27:47,374
Speaker 0: Scott?

385
00:27:47,615 --> 00:27:48,960
Speaker 0: there are currently?

386
00:27:49,061 --> 00:27:50,911
Speaker 1: Okay, yeah, none of those people can.

387
00:27:50,952 --> 00:27:53,863
Speaker 1: only three people have a chance of winning Real depends.

388
00:27:53,903 --> 00:27:54,787
Speaker 0: I mean right now remember.

389
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:59,848
Speaker 0: There's the primary which has to happen first and in the primary There are like 11 people running.

390
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,077
Speaker 1: yet only two of those people can win.

391
00:28:02,177 --> 00:28:02,338
Speaker 0: who?

392
00:28:02,378 --> 00:28:02,599
Speaker 0: which?

393
00:28:02,619 --> 00:28:05,969
Speaker 1: to The Quinn and Wiener, but I don't know Wiener.

394
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,599
Speaker 1: I think they're saying he has more votes than the actually has been.

395
00:28:09,168 --> 00:28:15,772
Speaker 0: Rising Target forward momentum in Wiener's.

396
00:28:15,813 --> 00:28:17,480
Speaker 1: can I think those are fake polls?

397
00:28:17,620 --> 00:28:20,510
Speaker 0: In fact, you could say that his poll numbers are swelling.

398
00:28:20,751 --> 00:28:21,052
Speaker 1: Yes.

399
00:28:21,192 --> 00:28:22,316
Speaker 1: I think those might be.

400
00:28:22,758 --> 00:28:25,411
Speaker 0: I only stole Jokes from another podcast.

401
00:28:25,512 --> 00:28:28,468
Speaker 1: I think those might be Manufactured polls.

402
00:28:28,488 --> 00:28:37,276
Speaker 0: Well, the thing is they're just recently Mmm, basically he's pulling between 17 and 25 percent and Quinn's pulling between 19 and 20 percent.

403
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:38,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll see what happens.

404
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:44,166
Speaker 1: We're definitely not voting for ya Republican guy not voting for you, dude.

405
00:28:44,507 --> 00:28:45,048
Speaker 1: What's his name?

406
00:28:45,389 --> 00:28:46,753
Speaker 1: Thompson something Johnson?

407
00:28:46,773 --> 00:28:47,174
Speaker 1: I don't know.

408
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:48,277
Speaker 0: Well, actually yeah there.

409
00:28:48,317 --> 00:28:56,333
Speaker 0: well, there's uh, There's Loda who has the highest Polling right now, but almost half of Republicans are undecided because they just don't care.

410
00:28:56,353 --> 00:28:57,076
Speaker 0: They're not gonna win.

411
00:28:57,096 --> 00:28:58,420
Speaker 1: And of course, it's New York.

412
00:28:58,522 --> 00:29:03,929
Speaker 0: but anyway Political activism seems to just turn off normal people.

413
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:05,735
Speaker 0: just kind of basically activism of any kind.

414
00:29:06,056 --> 00:29:10,060
Speaker 0: the average person just kind of immediately Justice who aren't quiet exactly.

415
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:11,810
Speaker 0: But seriously guys.

416
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:23,280
Speaker 0: the Patriot Act was passed a long time ago And also even if there hadn't been all these stories about the things that happen over all these years I pretty much assumed the fact that the only leak we got was that they're collecting the metadata.

417
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:26,320
Speaker 0: I pretty much assumed they're gathering everything at this point.

418
00:29:26,467 --> 00:29:31,111
Speaker 1: Okay So anyway, the original point is that nerds were not surprised right.

419
00:29:31,192 --> 00:29:34,540
Speaker 1: normal people for some reason this time paid attention and were surprised.

420
00:29:34,821 --> 00:29:38,620
Speaker 0: Difference between when Al Capone is going on a tangent here.

421
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:42,535
Speaker 1: Nerds already know what to fucking do about it, right?

422
00:29:42,575 --> 00:29:43,459
Speaker 0: I don't think they do.

423
00:29:44,122 --> 00:29:45,387
Speaker 1: Most of them do.

424
00:29:45,428 --> 00:29:48,400
Speaker 0: a lot of our listeners know what to do and they're not tech nerds.

425
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:51,080
Speaker 1: If you don't know what to do, I don't think there's that many tech nerds.

426
00:29:51,202 --> 00:29:51,920
Speaker 1: That's what I'm saying.

427
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,395
Speaker 1: But the tech nerds who knew about it were on slashdot.

428
00:29:54,415 --> 00:29:59,518
Speaker 1: those kind of people Already knew what to do about it And if they cared we're already doing what they were doing about it.

429
00:30:00,862 --> 00:30:04,880
Speaker 1: And the other people, they're the ones who don't know but now they suddenly care.

430
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:12,240
Speaker 1: So they have a situation where the people who cared were also the people who knew and did something about it already.

431
00:30:12,422 --> 00:30:13,699
Speaker 1: So it was sort of like, okay, we're done.

432
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:20,720
Speaker 1: But now we have a new influx of people who care, didn't know about it before, but still don't know what the fuck to do about it.

433
00:30:21,721 --> 00:30:34,420
Speaker 1: And the answer is, in short, to do anything about it will make your computer using very inconvenient but also secure Because for some security, especially security that fucking works, you have to trade away convenience.

434
00:30:34,723 --> 00:30:36,039
Speaker 1: There is no way around that.

435
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:40,160
Speaker 1: So if you care that much, how much do you care?

436
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:47,600
Speaker 1: How much trouble and effort are you going to go through to keep the government from reading and spying on your shit on the internet?

437
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,119
Speaker 1: Ask yourself that question.

438
00:30:49,542 --> 00:30:52,640
Speaker 0: So now we can go through basically the levels of paranoia.

439
00:30:52,821 --> 00:31:02,460
Speaker 1: Like every level up is increased paranoia, increased protection, increased inconvenience Which is the reason I do not do most of these things.

440
00:31:02,682 --> 00:31:04,298
Speaker 0: I also do not do most of these things.

441
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:10,350
Speaker 1: My paranoia level is low and my convenience desire is high And also I don't really have things to keep secret.

442
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,400
Speaker 1: but if I did I would probably do more stuff.

443
00:31:12,541 --> 00:31:22,460
Speaker 0: I think what helps is that we live kind of open lives partly because of geek nights And two, I mean it's already kind of public knowledge that we're both members of the most hated minority in America.

444
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:30,720
Speaker 0: So there's not, I mean, if someone, if we ever ran for political office, people just have to be like Atheists, here's evidence and we'd be done.

445
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:41,779
Speaker 0: So if we were into, I don't know, baby telephone porn That's against the law, I'm pretty sure Probably We should go to jail.

446
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,739
Speaker 0: Probably should, but that would not.

447
00:31:44,382 --> 00:31:49,460
Speaker 1: And don't take that as I'm making an argument of you don't do anything wrong, what do you have to keep secret?

448
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,440
Speaker 1: Because we all know the answer to that argument.

449
00:31:51,565 --> 00:31:53,102
Speaker 1: Yup But it's just.

450
00:31:53,302 --> 00:31:58,939
Speaker 1: I personally choose to not care that much because I personally don't care about keeping things secret.

451
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:14,880
Speaker 0: But nonetheless, level one, the level one of protecting yourself and paranoia is having some form of locally encrypted file system Mmm Any kind, I mean I have a true crypt volume, it's like 50 megabytes.

452
00:32:15,422 --> 00:32:25,380
Speaker 0: I put passwords in there, I put small amounts of data in there, sensitive files about things that If someone who didn't like me got a hold of them could probably cause me a significant amount of financial hardship.

453
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:33,120
Speaker 0: Yup Those files and those passwords and all that are in this little encrypted file And I just put it on Google Drive because it's encrypted, what the fuck are they gonna do?

454
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:42,900
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's really simple to do this, you get a piece of software that handles it for you like true crypt And you basically have files and sometimes, you know, you have to type in a password when your computer turns on.

455
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:47,957
Speaker 1: And sometimes you type in a password when you access the files and pretty much no one can read those files.

456
00:32:47,998 --> 00:32:48,560
Speaker 1: who is not you?

457
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,398
Speaker 1: Yup That's all there is to it.

458
00:32:50,801 --> 00:32:55,740
Speaker 0: Now, it basically causes no inconvenience, if I want to access those files I just mount it and type a password.

459
00:32:55,780 --> 00:33:02,939
Speaker 1: That's still technically an inconvenience that you have to type a password now when you did not previously But I have to type a password to open my computer anyway That's true.

460
00:33:03,564 --> 00:33:05,740
Speaker 0: The amount of added inconvenience is negligible.

461
00:33:05,961 --> 00:33:12,600
Speaker 1: Yup, sometimes you can configure it where simply logging into your user account also decrypts the keys that are on the computer.

462
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:16,420
Speaker 0: More importantly, it gives me something I couldn't do before.

463
00:33:16,561 --> 00:33:29,158
Speaker 0: So it gives me an increased convenience of because I have encrypted it in this manner I can put it somewhere public, I can post it to Fark and Reddit for all I care And download it whenever I need it.

464
00:33:30,003 --> 00:33:33,320
Speaker 0: So I put it on Google Drive, I don't have to trust Google at all.

465
00:33:33,782 --> 00:33:41,580
Speaker 1: Yup, this is really good stuff, for example if you want to cross country borders Right, so let's say Australia was an evil country, way super evil.

466
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,359
Speaker 1: You're saying they're not?

467
00:33:42,460 --> 00:33:49,280
Speaker 1: They're not perfect, right, but they're not, you know, they're not like freaking, you know, China or some shit, right And I go into Australia and get some data.

468
00:33:49,842 --> 00:34:09,600
Speaker 1: I upload that shit to the internet in Australia, obviously over an encrypted channel with a VPN or something, which we'll get to And it's encrypted and it's on Google Drive and then I delete all my hard drives and my SD cards And then I go back to the US and then I download it and I just cross the borders with the data And the customs people couldn't do shit because I walked across with a bunch of blank drives and disks.

469
00:34:09,786 --> 00:34:11,690
Speaker 1: Yup Maybe I'll have a clean Windows install.

470
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,239
Speaker 1: so it looks like it's for real, I don't know.

471
00:34:13,501 --> 00:34:15,319
Speaker 0: I guess we should back up, there is a level zero.

472
00:34:15,742 --> 00:34:19,045
Speaker 0: Don't install malware bullshit and compromise your computer *gasp*.

473
00:34:19,722 --> 00:34:22,060
Speaker 0: If you do that, then level one doesn't mean anything.

474
00:34:22,163 --> 00:34:22,679
Speaker 0: That's right.

475
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:33,540
Speaker 0: If there's a keylogger, if there's an ass.com malware toolbar, if there's anything on your computer If you ever installed Wares, you probably have a virus.

476
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:42,560
Speaker 1: An addendum to level one is something you can do is make that encrypted drive a USB stick And then you can physically hide that USB stick.

477
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:48,040
Speaker 1: So if the government ever comes to confiscate all your computers, all your stuff is on this USB stick that they're not gonna find.

478
00:34:48,241 --> 00:34:49,206
Speaker 0: Yeah, remember in hackers?

479
00:34:49,447 --> 00:34:51,739
Speaker 0: Hey, I put it in that place, I put that thing that one time.

480
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:59,180
Speaker 1: Yup That doesn't mean anything, that's actually a code, but But you know, you can leave it somewhere that's not in your apartment, perhaps like with a neighbor or something, right?

481
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,359
Speaker 1: And your neighbor can't do anything with it because it's encrypted.

482
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:02,779
Speaker 1: It's encrypted.

483
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:05,940
Speaker 1: Yeah Leave it at your parents' house, I don't know, whatever.

484
00:35:06,301 --> 00:35:13,020
Speaker 0: Like I said, it's the kind of, you can put it publicly posted, publish it in the newspaper if you can give it small enough.

485
00:35:13,542 --> 00:35:18,178
Speaker 1: Also part of level one is whenever you type, this should be something everyone just does.

486
00:35:18,238 --> 00:35:21,202
Speaker 1: in general It's like almost sort of level 0.5.

487
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:32,059
Speaker 1: But yeah, level one, if you are typing something into a website on the internet And sending that information across the internet to somewhere, you know, an email in your Gmail or something, right?

488
00:35:33,101 --> 00:35:37,160
Speaker 1: Look and make sure the SSL thingy is on and correct, right?

489
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:49,920
Speaker 1: Actually click on the lock and like look what it's saying And you make, you want to see if it has forward secrecy It'll also might have letters like ECDHE, which basically means forward secrecy.

490
00:35:50,701 --> 00:35:52,280
Speaker 1: Forward secrecy is very important.

491
00:35:52,681 --> 00:36:06,140
Speaker 1: That means that, yeah, even if the government is recording all of this encrypted stuff that you're sending over the SSLs over the internet If sometime later they get the key, they won't be able to decrypt everything they've ever captured from you.

492
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,598
Speaker 1: They'll need to get many different keys to do that, right?

493
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:20,880
Speaker 1: They'll only get a little bit of data if they crack it, which, you know, as opposed to if you don't have that And they get the key there and they crack it, they're going to decrypt everything they've ever recorded of you and your Gmail or whatever.

494
00:36:21,143 --> 00:36:22,537
Speaker 1: So be careful for that one.

495
00:36:23,307 --> 00:36:33,999
Speaker 1: Alright, so level- Whenever you type something in, don't type it in And if you care about the government seeing it or anyone seeing it, make sure the lock is on And it'll only be sent between you and the person you're sending it to and no one else.

496
00:36:34,603 --> 00:36:37,900
Speaker 0: So level two, some sort of VPN like iPredator

497
00:36:38,065 --> 00:36:38,459
Speaker 1: Oh yeah

498
00:36:38,621 --> 00:36:43,208
Speaker 0: That is probably, level two is probably as far as most of you ever get currently because level two- It's also

499
00:36:43,228 --> 00:36:43,918
Speaker 1: pretty easy to do

500
00:36:44,442 --> 00:36:48,660
Speaker 0: Is what people use to pirate things if they're worried about getting in trouble for piracy.

501
00:36:49,183 --> 00:36:52,500
Speaker 1: So what a VPN does, I think we've explained it before so I'll just be real quick.

502
00:36:52,901 --> 00:36:57,940
Speaker 1: Is it basically creates a secure tunnel between you and another spot on the internet?

503
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:20,900
Speaker 1: So for example, iPredator I think is usually between you and somewhere that Pirate Bay has a server in Europe somewhere Like Sweden or something or France And basically all the traffic on your computer, but when it comes out of your computer, gets encrypted and gets sent to France or Sweden And when- then it goes onto the internet like normal Then it comes back to that spot in Sweden or France and then gets encrypted and sent back to you.

504
00:37:21,301 --> 00:37:28,080
Speaker 0: Now, both SSL and VPNs require you to trust the person on the other end.

505
00:37:28,281 --> 00:37:28,917
Speaker 0: Mhm, mhm, mhm.

506
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:32,340
Speaker 0: So if Google is the certificate, Google can do whatever they want.

507
00:37:32,722 --> 00:37:35,620
Speaker 0: They can decrypt the same data you're sending them or else your webpage wouldn't work.

508
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:40,540
Speaker 1: That's the point, the point of SSL and VPN is that you're sending data to this other person you trust.

509
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:43,760
Speaker 1: Perhaps Google, PayPal, and only they are getting it.

510
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:48,039
Speaker 1: No one in between you and PayPal is looking at your credit card number that you just typed in.

511
00:37:48,461 --> 00:37:54,520
Speaker 1: Right, it's getting to PayPal securely, but you have to trust PayPal, PayPal can just spill the beans to the Feds.

512
00:37:54,661 --> 00:37:56,800
Speaker 0: But in the same way, it's the idea of trust networks.

513
00:37:56,900 --> 00:38:01,240
Speaker 0: If I give Scott a thing and then he blabs and tells everyone, I mean there's nothing I can do about that.

514
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:09,339
Speaker 1: That's right, if you direct message someone on Twitter or have a locked Twitter account And someone just copy and paste all your tweets because you let them follow you?

515
00:38:10,441 --> 00:38:12,980
Speaker 1: That's why I don't understand the point of locked Twitter accounts, they're completely stupid.

516
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:13,580
Speaker 1: They're kind of silly.

517
00:38:13,641 --> 00:38:14,740
Speaker 1: They defeat the entire purpose.

518
00:38:15,263 --> 00:38:20,760
Speaker 0: I guess they're for people who want to use Twitter and talk to their friends But actively want to avoid anyone else interacting with them.

519
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:33,160
Speaker 1: I guess if you didn't broadcast anything, if you were only doing like, you know You only wanted to direct message and add friends like an instant messenger But you wanted to follow a bunch of people and have an account But you didn't want anyone to see anything you ever sent.

520
00:38:33,402 --> 00:38:40,220
Speaker 0: Now there is a problem also with using these VPNs That yes, your traffic is basically sort of encrypted and then it pops out.

521
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:48,478
Speaker 0: So it comes out of nowhere in Sweden and ostensibly the person you trust to set up this VPN Is not keeping any logs, which is doable.

522
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:58,619
Speaker 0: Anyone observing that traffic might be able to figure out who you are or what you're up to Just because the traffic is still all associated with your tunnel in some fashion.

523
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:04,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, the people running the VPN might be able to figure it out But anyone else who's, you know, let's say I visit Google.com.

524
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:07,853
Speaker 1: Google.com is just going to see like anon1501.vpn whatever.

525
00:39:09,942 --> 00:39:10,838
Speaker 1: They don't know who I am.

526
00:39:11,161 --> 00:39:18,339
Speaker 1: But the people running the VPN can be like, aha, anon1501 just visited Google And that is an IP address for New York.

527
00:39:18,603 --> 00:39:19,619
Speaker 1: It is Scott, hahaha.

528
00:39:20,283 --> 00:39:23,320
Speaker 1: But they had to be actively monitoring if they're not logging.

529
00:39:23,360 --> 00:39:25,180
Speaker 1: But if I were a government You're fucked.

530
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:33,360
Speaker 0: If you were a government, you could just sniff all of the traffic coming out of one of these VPN egress points And over time from that aggregated data.

531
00:39:33,721 --> 00:39:47,320
Speaker 0: I mean, if you use the VPN and you keep logging into your Gmail through it Then eventually they'll know But not if that's SSL Gmail Exactly, but then they could figure out that that Gmail account is using iPredator.

532
00:39:47,902 --> 00:39:54,160
Speaker 0: Maybe then they do some heuristics or things to figure out what other traffic was happening around the same time that you checked your email.

533
00:39:54,861 --> 00:40:00,560
Speaker 0: And then, oh, well, there is a search for a thing that is definitely in the hometown of the person we're looking at And we know who uses Gmail.

534
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:05,980
Speaker 0: And there are ways if someone's out to get you to start to put a picture together.

535
00:40:06,081 --> 00:40:16,040
Speaker 1: But it's way difficult It's a ton of effort, basically Huge, expensive effort to figure something like that out Perhaps even closing on the not impossible, but improbable territories.

536
00:40:16,643 --> 00:40:19,740
Speaker 1: So really, this is why it's so, you know, these are easy things to do.

537
00:40:19,861 --> 00:40:25,260
Speaker 1: A VPN you set up once, you just click to activate it Encrypting a thing, you type in a password, only a slight inconvenience.

538
00:40:25,903 --> 00:40:41,279
Speaker 1: And it already raises the security level of doing these particular activities Storing data privately and visiting websites and doing internet privately To such a high level that the government, a very large government thing would have to be specifically after you.

539
00:40:42,042 --> 00:40:46,319
Speaker 1: And they're after you so much that they're going to expend a ton of resources to come after you.

540
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:51,440
Speaker 0: And if they're after you to that point, they've already put a physical keylogger in your computer with a warrant.

541
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:53,920
Speaker 1: Maybe Check the back of your computer.

542
00:40:54,203 --> 00:41:02,557
Speaker 1: Yeah, well, you'd probably want to check inside That too, but it's like if you see anything on, you know, your keyboard cable between your keyboard and the computer Where it's supposed to be.

543
00:41:03,181 --> 00:41:09,040
Speaker 0: How many of our listeners are going to go to their work, see the like PS2 to USB converter and unplug it?

544
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:20,019
Speaker 1: Oops, yeah, no I think you know what that is, but I'm sure they make a PS2 to USB converter that is also a keylogger And I'm sure they also make keyloggers that you can put inside of the keyboard where no one would see it.

545
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:30,360
Speaker 0: Or hell, if you work by an office window, I'll just have an HD camera and a telephoto lens pointed at your desk And just video you typing And a really tiny camera that you couldn't possibly notice unless you lurked really hard for it.

546
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,360
Speaker 1: You paranoid nut job.

547
00:41:32,181 --> 00:41:36,439
Speaker 0: Or just arrest you and beat you with a hammer until you fess up to whatever it is they want you to fess up to.

548
00:41:36,701 --> 00:41:40,740
Speaker 1: That's so much easier, but that kind of confession doesn't stand in court, at least not in this country.

549
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:50,636
Speaker 0: So level three, and I think this is a really kind of sub level, but if you're super paranoid You make one of those encrypted volumes and you do the true crypt style.

550
00:41:51,038 --> 00:42:00,140
Speaker 1: yo dog I can type in any password you want, they all return gibberish Right, so basically you, this is a step further than level one where you're encrypting this folder.

551
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:03,533
Speaker 1: You encrypt every hard drive you have, every disk, every.

552
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:08,460
Speaker 1: everything is encrypted with passwords And you turn the computer on, you have to type in a password to get the thing to boot.

553
00:42:09,002 --> 00:42:13,660
Speaker 1: But if you type the wrong password, it doesn't say wrong password, it just decrypts using that.

554
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:16,339
Speaker 1: And, you know, it may or may not work.

555
00:42:16,782 --> 00:42:27,159
Speaker 0: Or you set it up to where you have multiple volumes You have, if you type in password A, you get your real data Password B, you get a hard drive with some innocuous porn on it and that's it.

556
00:42:27,563 --> 00:42:38,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, legal porn Yeah, so that way, you know, for example, with something like this, you could, if you wanted to bring data Over a country border without using my internet method, right?

557
00:42:39,602 --> 00:42:43,680
Speaker 1: Like, for example, in China, that internet is not safe to upload over, right?

558
00:42:44,220 --> 00:42:48,580
Speaker 1: You would arrive at the airport and customs, if they're jerky, would be like, let me look at your laptop.

559
00:42:48,721 --> 00:42:51,420
Speaker 1: And then they say, type in a password, unlock this thing.

560
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:54,820
Speaker 1: Now you're going to, you are allowed to say no and you could try to fight that.

561
00:42:55,022 --> 00:42:58,939
Speaker 1: Well, it's China, you might not be allowed to say no That's true, but, I mean, you're coming into the U.S.

562
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:05,620
Speaker 1: I forget how to say Bielerusia, showing there You're in some weird country, you don't want to type in your password, you shouldn't have to, that's right.

563
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:10,620
Speaker 1: But, why not type in the fake password that makes the computer boot into some innocuous looking OS?

564
00:43:11,042 --> 00:43:13,980
Speaker 1: The customs agent will be way too dumb to know anything about that.

565
00:43:14,268 --> 00:43:15,638
Speaker 1: Now You'll totally fool them.

566
00:43:15,921 --> 00:43:25,940
Speaker 0: There is a way, this is called deniable encryption That there's no mathematical way to prove that there is or is not another volume that you didn't show them.

567
00:43:26,361 --> 00:43:34,620
Speaker 0: Because the data in a pre-decrypted state, so an encrypted state, is basically indistinguishable from random data.

568
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,660
Speaker 0: Because all the places where you don't have data stored, it is random.

569
00:43:39,387 --> 00:43:40,819
Speaker 1: Yeah, let me explain this better, right?

570
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:45,480
Speaker 1: So, let's say I have a text file, I want to encrypt it, and it's got a three letter word in it.

571
00:43:45,540 --> 00:43:49,000
Speaker 1: The word is cat, I want to send the secret message of cat to rim, right?

572
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,300
Speaker 1: So I encrypt it, and now it says D-X-Q instead of cat.

573
00:43:52,661 --> 00:43:57,520
Speaker 1: And we know, if you have the right key to decrypt D-X-Q, it turns it into cat, and that's how you know the right key.

574
00:43:57,662 --> 00:43:58,579
Speaker 0: Now there is another key.

575
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:02,920
Speaker 1: But, what if somebody uses the wrong key, and it decrypts, and it says dog?

576
00:44:03,582 --> 00:44:05,300
Speaker 1: Well, how do you know that that wasn't the right key?

577
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:11,820
Speaker 1: If that person doesn't know, right, see, I know that the right answer is cat, so I know if they use a key and it says dog, that they got the wrong key.

578
00:44:12,541 --> 00:44:17,760
Speaker 1: But, they don't know, they decrypt with their key, and it says dog, and that very well could be the right answer.

579
00:44:18,122 --> 00:44:20,799
Speaker 1: They don't know what the right answer is, that's why they're trying to decrypt it.

580
00:44:21,301 --> 00:44:27,040
Speaker 1: So, if you have encryption that works that way, right, on a higher level with a more complicated example, right?

581
00:44:27,260 --> 00:44:33,020
Speaker 1: They type in some password, they think they got it right, really they got it wrong, and they didn't find anything.

582
00:44:33,201 --> 00:44:36,536
Speaker 1: But they think that they've already cracked it, and now you're innocent.

583
00:44:36,576 --> 00:44:37,440
Speaker 1: now, they didn't find shit.

584
00:44:37,661 --> 00:44:43,580
Speaker 0: This is why one-time pads are actually unbreakable as long as the protocol is followed.

585
00:44:44,066 --> 00:44:45,322
Speaker 1: That's like level 100.

586
00:44:45,322 --> 00:44:58,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, we'll get to real one-time pads in the end Right Now, the other trouble with this, the reason this is level 3, is that it is actually a giant pain in the ass to maintain this dual-layered encryption at all times.

587
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:05,960
Speaker 0: Because, sure, you type in your password and your computer boots, and it's Windows 98 that's never visited a website.

588
00:45:11,364 --> 00:45:25,400
Speaker 0: Or, you use the other one, they say they monitor you over time, they start to figure out that you're obviously doing something Because all this other data keeps changing in a sort of uniform manner because of swap space and all these other things in your real encrypted volume.

589
00:45:25,902 --> 00:45:30,960
Speaker 0: So they could make a mathematical case that there was data in that other area that you refused to decrypt.

590
00:45:31,405 --> 00:45:32,498
Speaker 1: But they can't find out what it is.

591
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:38,920
Speaker 0: They can't find out what it is unless they beat it out of you with a tire iron Which, again, is not admissible in court, at least in this country.

592
00:45:40,641 --> 00:45:47,560
Speaker 1: So, level 4, GPG Mmm, pain in the ass time, basically Try emailing Wil Wheaton.

593
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:51,560
Speaker 1: Right I think he makes you sign, I don't think he makes you encrypt.

594
00:45:51,600 --> 00:46:01,900
Speaker 0: So he will not respond to you unless you sign, but he is more likely to respond, as far as he says, at least, if you also encrypt But you don't have to encrypt everything.

595
00:46:02,121 --> 00:46:06,480
Speaker 1: So we did an episode on private public key encryption, you can go back and listen to it, not gonna explain it again.

596
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:15,780
Speaker 1: But basically, you basically would take Wil Wheaton's public key, encrypt an email, sign it with your private key, and then mail it to him.

597
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:29,000
Speaker 1: And now when he receives that email, he can both a) he's the only one in the world that can decrypt and read that email And b) he can mathematically 100% verify that email came from you and isn't like a fake email from someone else that wasn't you.

598
00:46:29,401 --> 00:46:36,080
Speaker 1: And then he can likewise do the same to you using your public key to encrypt a response, mail it to you, sign it with his private key.

599
00:46:36,361 --> 00:46:41,240
Speaker 1: And when you receive his email, you will 100% know for a fact that email came from Wil Wheaton.

600
00:46:41,681 --> 00:46:47,300
Speaker 1: No one besides you was able to read that email, no matter how much spying they were doing, and such and such.

601
00:46:47,762 --> 00:46:50,637
Speaker 0: Now this is easy to do in theory.

602
00:46:51,301 --> 00:46:53,620
Speaker 1: It's easy to do for one-off emails to Wil Wheaton.

603
00:46:53,660 --> 00:46:59,040
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, well even then, in general There are free tools, free software, you click, you copy and paste a few keys in different places.

604
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:05,220
Speaker 0: I mean, literally, you use like GPG and you just copy and paste and encrypt it like in a little program and then paste the result.

605
00:47:05,525 --> 00:47:06,320
Speaker 0: It's a blob of gibberish.

606
00:47:06,320 --> 00:47:12,022
Speaker 1: You write your email in one program, you copy and paste it, you click the encrypt button, you copy and paste it, you push send Right?

607
00:47:12,424 --> 00:47:16,020
Speaker 1: It's a little bit of effort, you know, but it's not the worst thing ever.

608
00:47:16,242 --> 00:47:17,819
Speaker 1: And if you really need to do it, you can do it.

609
00:47:18,081 --> 00:47:22,040
Speaker 1: But the reason it's a level 3 inconvenience is Level 4.

610
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,539
Speaker 1: Who wants to run all your- oh, level 4 The reason it's so inconvenient, who wants to run all your fucking shit through the-?

611
00:47:27,780 --> 00:47:31,780
Speaker 1: Imagine if you're sending every email like this, like Wil Wheaton must God, that's a pain in the ass.

612
00:47:31,840 --> 00:47:41,360
Speaker 1: Now there are plugins for like Chrome that can automate this for like Gmail But it's still a pain in the ass and it makes it very hard to email people who do not use this.

613
00:47:41,741 --> 00:47:52,799
Speaker 0: Now it's mostly a pain in the ass because yeah, like you said, if I email like grandma She's either gonna see my signature block at the bottom and be confused by it Or not be able to decrypt the mail if I actually encrypted it.

614
00:47:53,781 --> 00:48:03,540
Speaker 0: But the benefits you get if you care about the level of security is that while the metadata is still there The stuff we know the NSA is gathering, who emails whom, they still get that.

615
00:48:03,981 --> 00:48:10,699
Speaker 0: But there is no way for them to read the content and there is no way for anyone out there to fake being you.

616
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:21,300
Speaker 0: You can verify the identity of the person you're talking to And you can verify the contents of the message And you can prevent the message from being read by outsiders.

617
00:48:21,782 --> 00:48:30,205
Speaker 0: But it's a giant pain in the ass and really this is where we get to the- From level 5 and- or 4 and on, there was a level 4, sorry You- you- you-.

618
00:48:30,406 --> 00:48:33,980
Speaker 1: if you're using this you're up to bad things that are worth protecting and keeping secret.

619
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,100
Speaker 0: Or you're me in high school where I'm just bored and I have plenty of free time and government's not gonna look at my stuff.

620
00:48:40,140 --> 00:48:44,660
Speaker 1: Or maybe you want to get into cryptography as like your profession Yeah Yeah or something like that, you know.

621
00:48:44,721 --> 00:48:46,954
Speaker 0: But these are all the levels where- Or use it for a business purpose.

622
00:48:47,096 --> 00:48:58,120
Speaker 0: legitimately You need to coordinate in sideband channels like coordinate somewhere else With the people with whom you want to communicate and arrange for your secure communication.

623
00:48:58,525 --> 00:48:59,860
Speaker 0: You need to agree with your friends.

624
00:49:00,326 --> 00:49:01,359
Speaker 0: This is my public key.

625
00:49:01,741 --> 00:49:07,040
Speaker 0: You know we will use GPG to talk to each other when we're doing our shady business.

626
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:10,500
Speaker 0: You've shared keys and made arrangements ahead of time.

627
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:14,460
Speaker 0: Now you can share because this is public private key encryption.

628
00:49:15,083 --> 00:49:18,299
Speaker 0: You don't need to worry about people intercepting your key.

629
00:49:18,681 --> 00:49:22,439
Speaker 0: Your private key should be encrypted with your level 1 bullshit already.

630
00:49:23,763 --> 00:49:26,480
Speaker 0: So you can- you can give someone the public key publicly.

631
00:49:26,864 --> 00:49:28,300
Speaker 0: You can post it on the internet.

632
00:49:28,622 --> 00:49:31,239
Speaker 0: The public key will not help anyone steal your stuff.

633
00:49:31,923 --> 00:49:34,998
Speaker 0: In fact you have to publish it if you want strangers to be able to email you with it.

634
00:49:36,101 --> 00:49:38,500
Speaker 0: But it does require a little bit of coordination.

635
00:49:39,942 --> 00:49:42,699
Speaker 0: So beyond here this is basically the crazy stuff.

636
00:49:43,356 --> 00:49:50,600
Speaker 1: Yeah Like I would say- There's GPG VOIP which is basically the same idea with the email only with talking over voice.

637
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:56,160
Speaker 1: So you can make secure internet phone calls that are just as secure as the email to Will Wheaton.

638
00:49:56,522 --> 00:50:03,140
Speaker 1: Where the other person knows it is you calling but no doubt You know it's them calling and it's 100% impossible for anyone to tap that.

639
00:50:03,240 --> 00:50:15,060
Speaker 0: Like those government phones where you pick up- you know you both pick up You start talking but before you say anything important Both your phones show a number and you say the number you see to the other person And there's a way to prove that they match or not.

640
00:50:15,382 --> 00:50:19,200
Speaker 0: And if they don't match then there's a man in the middle attack going on Or some other shenanigans.

641
00:50:20,022 --> 00:50:26,520
Speaker 0: Now in the old days I actually used it and it worked Back when you'd use PGP and you can read the whole history of PGP.

642
00:50:26,825 --> 00:50:27,478
Speaker 0: Pretty good privacy.

643
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:28,840
Speaker 1: That was how the EFF got started.

644
00:50:29,005 --> 00:50:31,240
Speaker 0: Exactly PGP is a crazy story.

645
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:33,379
Speaker 0: GPG is kind of the current open source.

646
00:50:33,803 --> 00:50:35,880
Speaker 1: Well OpenSSL also does a lot of this stuff.

647
00:50:35,921 --> 00:50:36,338
Speaker 0: Yeah it does.

648
00:50:36,801 --> 00:50:42,240
Speaker 0: But there was PGP Phone which in the old days would encrypt the audio stream.

649
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:47,670
Speaker 0: So you could use a coupler and have phone calls over POTS And it would be encrypted.

650
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:48,334
Speaker 0: and it worked.

651
00:50:48,818 --> 00:50:56,720
Speaker 1: okay You would plug a telephone into your modem and your computer would basically encrypt everything When it came in the modem from your handheld phone and then send it on the internet.

652
00:50:56,840 --> 00:51:08,898
Speaker 0: This is now- this is the same era where the software that did this also had tempest mode Where you could tell it to when you read a PGP encrypted message It would display it in a window that can't be copy pasted out of.

653
00:51:09,462 --> 00:51:14,020
Speaker 0: Can't take a screenshot of it like as you could if you fuck around Take a camera and take a picture of it.

654
00:51:14,060 --> 00:51:20,560
Speaker 0: But it also would display it in a really low contrast hard to read window To protect you against tempest attacks.

655
00:51:21,524 --> 00:51:25,500
Speaker 0: Tempest is not much of a concern If you are worried about tempest type attacks.

656
00:51:26,082 --> 00:51:31,180
Speaker 0: One, I see no evidence that they're really possible now that we don't use tubes and CRTs anymore.

657
00:51:31,862 --> 00:51:36,879
Speaker 0: And two, the governments that are after you have probably already just kidnapped you.

658
00:51:40,144 --> 00:51:43,520
Speaker 1: Yeah there's a point at which like you're protecting from such ridiculous nonsense.

659
00:51:43,702 --> 00:51:45,020
Speaker 1: That's theoretically possible.

660
00:51:45,161 --> 00:51:54,000
Speaker 1: Like yeah the government could have like a super telescope on a satellite That's aimed at the ground and peeping in your window But you can beat that shit with a fucking curtain.

661
00:51:54,843 --> 00:51:57,279
Speaker 1: So they're probably not wasting their time and money on that.

662
00:51:57,803 --> 00:52:02,435
Speaker 1: They probably can just walk up to your house and bash the door down Which is as simple as a curtain.

663
00:52:02,838 --> 00:52:05,540
Speaker 1: right That was the point of using a giant satellite.

664
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:11,220
Speaker 1: You know you have to think about what they're using against you To the point where you're getting a little ridiculous.

665
00:52:12,540 --> 00:52:16,100
Speaker 0: So level numbers don't really matter that much.

666
00:52:16,181 --> 00:52:24,360
Speaker 0: But if I had to say what level six is This is if you for real care and you don't even want the metadata to be able to be used.

667
00:52:24,802 --> 00:52:29,320
Speaker 0: And this is where you need not just deniable encryption but deniable communication.

668
00:52:30,141 --> 00:52:34,540
Speaker 0: Now a good example of this are the old famous numbers stations.

669
00:52:35,182 --> 00:52:40,600
Speaker 0: These are radio networks, radio stations that just broadcast someone saying numbers.

670
00:52:40,963 --> 00:52:48,780
Speaker 0: You can listen to these things with radios all over the world And you'll just hear seven, nine, four, three, eight, just on and on and on.

671
00:52:49,242 --> 00:52:55,619
Speaker 0: Nerds in the 60s and 70s would record these things and analyze them And think it's UFOs and freak out about them.

672
00:52:56,703 --> 00:53:09,195
Speaker 0: The modern equivalent of that would be You every day post 512 seemingly random bytes publicly to like 4chan Every day, every single day at the same time, 512 bytes.

673
00:53:10,961 --> 00:53:24,399
Speaker 0: There is no way to know who is reading that reliably because it's posted publicly Especially if it's posted publicly somewhere where there isn't A logging or a mechanism to see who made HTTP requests to see it.

674
00:53:24,681 --> 00:53:31,860
Speaker 0: Say you post it in line with a thousand other people who post their 512s In the same forum at the same time in the same thread.

675
00:53:32,582 --> 00:53:37,159
Speaker 0: So every day you post it and then maybe every day you look at it as well.

676
00:53:38,084 --> 00:53:40,180
Speaker 0: All right, there's not much data you can get from that.

677
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:45,499
Speaker 0: You can't use the metadata of this phone number called this phone number This email address, email, this email address.

678
00:53:45,560 --> 00:53:46,580
Speaker 1: Well, you're saying it's just a few bytes.

679
00:53:46,762 --> 00:53:48,620
Speaker 1: Why not upload a gigabyte every day?

680
00:53:48,780 --> 00:53:57,480
Speaker 0: You could, but the idea is that you upload that 512 bytes And say Scott and I, we've separated and we're off doing our nefarious business.

681
00:53:57,942 --> 00:54:05,920
Speaker 0: And every day Scott just checks that site with the million separate 512-byte things That every other person puts up there.

682
00:54:06,222 --> 00:54:08,540
Speaker 0: Maybe we would have some bots putting random ones up there, whatever.

683
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:18,659
Speaker 0: And every day he uses his private secret one-time pad key to decrypt one of them And see if I had a message for him.

684
00:54:19,143 --> 00:54:21,080
Speaker 0: And most of the time the message is nothing.

685
00:54:21,481 --> 00:54:27,080
Speaker 0: But the one time the message is like "Look ye mighty, activate, it's time to play Counter-Strike".

686
00:54:28,645 --> 00:54:29,759
Speaker 0: Or "Meet me at the bar".

687
00:54:29,960 --> 00:54:31,600
Speaker 1: What if I run out of one-time pad pages?

688
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:34,079
Speaker 0: Well then you gotta exchange pads again.

689
00:54:36,962 --> 00:54:40,239
Speaker 0: Now, another way to do this sort of thing is with that old network called WAST.

690
00:54:40,661 --> 00:54:42,980
Speaker 0: We've talked about it a lot, I'm just gonna link to it, you can look it up.

691
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:59,080
Speaker 0: It's basically a network, like a sort of private network that you set up Like a bunch of VPNs between you and all your friends That not only are encrypted and relatively private And it's a friend list where you have a circle of trust And you add people that you trust and no one else.

692
00:55:00,021 --> 00:55:13,360
Speaker 0: But you can set it up to where it is sending a small amount of data Constantly between all the nodes at all times So that if you send data, the data just replaces the noise And there's no way to know that you're communicating or not.

693
00:55:13,521 --> 00:55:17,240
Speaker 0: As far as anyone's observing, you're always communicating and never communicating.

694
00:55:17,645 --> 00:55:18,780
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about this, right?

695
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:24,820
Speaker 1: When you go on BitTorrent, let's say you have an encrypted BitTorrent But your ISP is watching you and they know "Well, look at this".

696
00:55:25,020 --> 00:55:27,000
Speaker 1: "He's using a VPN encrypted BitTorrent".

697
00:55:27,522 --> 00:55:29,140
Speaker 1: They don't even know that, he's sending some datas.

698
00:55:29,881 --> 00:55:40,520
Speaker 1: He downloaded exactly 2.73 gigabytes of data And that seems to be exactly the same number of bits In the newest hot movie in the theaters right now.

699
00:55:40,701 --> 00:55:43,460
Speaker 1: If I download that torrent that's real popular from Pirate Bay.

700
00:55:43,985 --> 00:55:45,480
Speaker 1: It's exactly the same file size.

701
00:55:45,984 --> 00:55:47,640
Speaker 0: Or think about the news or counter-terrorism.

702
00:55:48,083 --> 00:55:52,999
Speaker 0: Ever hear someone on the news say something like Due to increased chatter, they raise the security level?

703
00:55:53,700 --> 00:56:06,839
Speaker 0: What that means is people, nodes on some network that they're watching Because the "bad guys" use those nodes Suddenly have a flurry of communication where there wasn't any before Even if they don't know what that communication is.

704
00:56:07,121 --> 00:56:09,559
Speaker 0: You know some hornet's nest somewhere got poked.

705
00:56:10,183 --> 00:56:10,759
Speaker 1: Exactly, right?

706
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:13,720
Speaker 1: Bad, you know, if you think about it You know, think about, say, Kineticon.

707
00:56:13,801 --> 00:56:21,499
Speaker 1: For 10, Kineticon was a terrorist organization Which is the farthest from I don't know, if you go to some of those late night panels Maybe, right?

708
00:56:21,940 --> 00:56:22,298
Speaker 1: Guess what?

709
00:56:22,521 --> 00:56:27,259
Speaker 1: As it gets closer to Kineticon The Kineticon people talk to each other a lot more, right?

710
00:56:27,843 --> 00:56:30,120
Speaker 1: The day of Kineticon, we talk to each other like crazy.

711
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:39,820
Speaker 1: Well, if we were terrorists The day of our terrorist attack There's gonna be a lot more talking than like the year before When we're simply in like preparation discussion planning mode, right?

712
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:41,200
Speaker 1: There's a lot less talking going on.

713
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:43,280
Speaker 1: So even without knowing what we're saying, it's encrypted.

714
00:56:43,703 --> 00:56:46,240
Speaker 1: If they can see how many bits we're sharing, right?

715
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:49,940
Speaker 1: More calls, more letters, more whatever it is, right?

716
00:56:50,381 --> 00:56:51,840
Speaker 1: It's getting closer to the time.

717
00:56:51,961 --> 00:56:54,800
Speaker 1: So they're watching out looking for where we're gonna strike, right?

718
00:56:55,302 --> 00:57:05,139
Speaker 1: So if you just have fake, you know, undeniable encrypted Sort of messy random nonsense communicating at all times You're masking the chatter level.

719
00:57:05,483 --> 00:57:07,319
Speaker 1: So they'll never know, is today the day?

720
00:57:07,580 --> 00:57:08,531
Speaker 1: Or is tomorrow the day?

721
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:09,300
Speaker 1: Or a year from now?

722
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,440
Speaker 1: You just maintain that for a long period of time And they'll never know the day you're gonna strike.

723
00:57:13,582 --> 00:57:21,160
Speaker 1: Because the day you're gonna strike The chatter level doesn't increase It's just the fake chatter gets replaced with real chatter And the level remains the same Exactly.

724
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:29,160
Speaker 0: And it's clear, you know, you set these systems up Where if you try to send a lot of data all at once It throttles it down to send it at the predefined rate It's always sending gibberish.

725
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:34,400
Speaker 1: Yeah, in case you're accidentally talking more than, you know, the fake chatter.

726
00:57:34,541 --> 00:57:39,200
Speaker 1: So you don't give yourselves away by accidentally uploading A way too big file to the other guy or something.

727
00:57:39,402 --> 00:57:51,620
Speaker 0: Now the problem with everything at level 6 Is that you need to seriously prearrange everything ahead of time With the people with whom you want to communicate And you have to do it securely.

728
00:57:52,124 --> 00:57:57,340
Speaker 1: And you need to have a high level of technological skill Probably coding abilities If not hardware abilities.

729
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,120
Speaker 0: But like a public key you can give someone.

730
00:57:59,180 --> 00:58:06,299
Speaker 0: That's less secure encryption than a one-time pad Which is, if you follow protocol, unbreakable Literally unbreakable.

731
00:58:06,543 --> 00:58:09,800
Speaker 1: There is no technology Mathematically, 100% impossible.

732
00:58:10,001 --> 00:58:15,178
Speaker 1: If I encrypt a message with a one-time pad We can just give it to the NSA And be like, here you go.

733
00:58:16,804 --> 00:58:21,980
Speaker 1: It's not one of those things where like Oh, if they had a super quantum computer And a billion years they could figure it out.

734
00:58:22,041 --> 00:58:32,079
Speaker 1: It's like, no If they had an entire universe simulation You know, and 100 universe simulations Inside through a dimensional door They could never figure it out.

735
00:58:32,181 --> 00:58:35,800
Speaker 0: Of course, at that point Maybe they can just read your mind And steal the data out of it directly.

736
00:58:35,880 --> 00:58:36,082
Speaker 0: That

737
00:58:36,122 --> 00:58:38,659
Speaker 1: would be easier than cracking it, yes

738
00:58:39,124 --> 00:58:53,240
Speaker 0: So to exchange And here's the difficulty Scott and I could exchange privately A one-time pad that we construct ourselves right now With all those dice that are sitting over there in the studio And then we keep them in our wallets And go our separate ways.

739
00:58:53,524 --> 00:58:57,059
Speaker 0: And 20 years from now When we're up to our bullshit We use that pad.

740
00:58:58,243 --> 00:59:00,040
Speaker 0: Think about how much planning that takes.

741
00:59:00,262 --> 00:59:01,880
Speaker 0: I can't just email him the pad.

742
00:59:02,304 --> 00:59:03,919
Speaker 1: Then the government would see the pad.

743
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:09,100
Speaker 0: And if I encrypt the pad with PGP Now it's not unbreakable one-time pad.

744
00:59:09,281 --> 00:59:11,640
Speaker 0: It's as breakable as PGP is breakable.

745
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:16,780
Speaker 1: Yup What if, you know, the government comes And hits me on the head and takes the pad?

746
00:59:16,903 --> 00:59:18,459
Speaker 1: Well, fuck Exactly.

747
00:59:18,803 --> 00:59:21,485
Speaker 0: And then the problem with a one-time pad on its own Is that?

748
00:59:21,525 --> 00:59:22,373
Speaker 0: now I don't have any way to know.

749
00:59:22,413 --> 00:59:25,200
Speaker 0: it's not you anymore Unless we also have some sort of identity management.

750
00:59:25,502 --> 00:59:27,780
Speaker 0: So you want to encrypt PGP within the one-time pad.

751
00:59:28,041 --> 00:59:32,119
Speaker 1: And what if we fuck up and I lose a page Or I'm a page off?

752
00:59:32,240 --> 00:59:37,899
Speaker 0: Do you know how many stories from World War II and the Cold War Where someone, something got decrypted come down to?

753
00:59:38,343 --> 00:59:40,420
Speaker 0: Someone reused a page in their one-time pad?

754
00:59:40,772 --> 00:59:42,179
Speaker 0: Yup As soon as you reuse it you're fucked.

755
00:59:42,509 --> 00:59:44,380
Speaker 1: Yup Cannot reuse a page ever.

756
00:59:45,263 --> 00:59:48,360
Speaker 0: People have done clever things If you do XOR style encryption.

757
00:59:49,623 --> 00:59:51,320
Speaker 0: There was a program that did this.

758
00:59:51,381 --> 00:59:53,780
Speaker 0: I'm sure you could find it again Or you could just write something in Python.

759
00:59:53,881 --> 01:00:04,600
Speaker 0: The idea was you prearrange CDs Or, you know, albums And then when the time comes I take the second disk of the wall.

760
01:00:05,301 --> 01:00:07,280
Speaker 0: And you know to take the second disk of the wall.

761
01:00:07,703 --> 01:00:10,260
Speaker 0: And that happens to be what we're using for our one-time pad.

762
01:00:10,321 --> 01:00:10,839
Speaker 1: Well, you know you do.

763
01:00:10,900 --> 01:00:13,460
Speaker 1: And all your safe houses It's not technically a one-time pad.

764
01:00:13,546 --> 01:00:22,159
Speaker 1: Yeah All your safe houses you arrange Right Cassette tapes or something Or SD cards or who knows what Right In like a row on a shelf.

765
01:00:22,462 --> 01:00:25,740
Speaker 1: Probably CDs or albums would be more innocuous Right.

766
01:00:26,204 --> 01:00:27,880
Speaker 1: And then that is the one-time pad.

767
01:00:27,941 --> 01:00:30,120
Speaker 1: You never listen to them And they're in order.

768
01:00:30,645 --> 01:00:35,332
Speaker 1: So when you have to use one You start at the left Right And then you leave the last one.

769
01:00:35,352 --> 01:00:38,720
Speaker 1: you use sticking out And you always use one at a time exactly.

770
01:00:38,843 --> 01:00:46,339
Speaker 1: So you can send You know I guess if you use CDs 640 megabytes of data to the other person You can burn 800 megabytes if you really wing it.

771
01:00:46,949 --> 01:00:53,812
Speaker 1: I guess maybe Yeah But you send that much data to the other guy at once at a time And then you switch to the next album.

772
01:00:54,174 --> 01:00:54,999
Speaker 1: every single you know.

773
01:00:55,361 --> 01:00:58,140
Speaker 0: But again all this stuff requires ridiculous forethought.

774
01:00:58,606 --> 01:00:59,820
Speaker 0: And you have to do the forethought.

775
01:00:59,901 --> 01:01:02,078
Speaker 1: One person has to go in all the safe houses and arrange all the CDs.

776
01:01:02,662 --> 01:01:05,120
Speaker 0: And now you need to do spy shit to make sure you don't get tracked.

777
01:01:05,263 --> 01:01:11,469
Speaker 0: Do it in winter Wear a big hat Use cash Don't use a rental car Don't have the safe houses.

778
01:01:11,589 --> 01:01:13,299
Speaker 0: all be in a circle around your house.

779
01:01:15,681 --> 01:01:17,577
Speaker 1: You should watch Ghost in the Shell for more info.

780
01:01:18,068 --> 01:01:26,100
Speaker 1: Yeah And I mean beyond that is things like If you are doing something to where you need this level of protection Stop doing it.

781
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,419
Speaker 0: Well not in the United States.

782
01:01:27,744 --> 01:01:28,880
Speaker 1: Stop doing whatever you're doing.

783
01:01:29,186 --> 01:01:29,840
Speaker 0: You're up to no good.

784
01:01:30,182 --> 01:01:32,700
Speaker 0: The kids in Egypt and the kids in Turkey and all the.

785
01:01:32,720 --> 01:01:34,519
Speaker 1: They don't need safe houses and one-time pads.

786
01:01:34,726 --> 01:01:35,100
Speaker 1: They might.

787
01:01:35,428 --> 01:01:35,940
Speaker 1: I don't think so.

788
01:01:35,981 --> 01:01:36,378
Speaker 0: They might.

789
01:01:36,743 --> 01:01:38,319
Speaker 1: I think PGP would be the limit for them.

790
01:01:38,681 --> 01:01:43,540
Speaker 0: But the level the thing is PGP is going to stop most governments from doing much about Pretty much anybody.

791
01:01:44,003 --> 01:01:47,000
Speaker 0: But level seven like beyond that is seriously.

792
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:50,380
Speaker 0: You bought a used laptop with cash.

793
01:01:50,682 --> 01:01:53,020
Speaker 0: It doesn't have a hard drive in it just RAM.

794
01:01:53,141 --> 01:01:56,320
Speaker 0: You boot it with a Linux live CD then take the CD out.

795
01:01:56,762 --> 01:02:07,140
Speaker 0: You access it from behind the Starbucks wearing masks And you walked there taking a roundabout way And after you did your data dump you left the laptop behind.

796
01:02:07,529 --> 01:02:11,540
Speaker 1: Yes Maybe destroying it Maybe destroying it At least smashing the RAM.

797
01:02:11,601 --> 01:02:13,220
Speaker 1: The other parts you don't really need to destroy.

798
01:02:13,300 --> 01:02:17,020
Speaker 0: And then you're more worried about stuff like was there a security camera?

799
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,199
Speaker 0: Yup Where I went?

800
01:02:18,544 --> 01:02:19,680
Speaker 0: Did I leave a fingerprint?

801
01:02:20,444 --> 01:02:21,859
Speaker 1: Did I leave a DNA hair?

802
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,780
Speaker 0: Yup Was the camera?

803
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:32,260
Speaker 0: Did the store I bought the laptop from two years ago with cash Still keep its video footage of that time that I walked in and bought that laptop with cash?

804
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,720
Speaker 1: Could the government find the serial number of the hardware of the laptop Figure out where it was bought and when it was bought?

805
01:02:37,821 --> 01:02:39,479
Speaker 0: Is the government already watching me?

806
01:02:40,144 --> 01:02:42,540
Speaker 0: This is the level of the crazy these high levels here.

807
01:02:43,301 --> 01:02:48,760
Speaker 0: You have to set this stuff up before anyone who cares about your bullshit starts watching you.

808
01:02:48,901 --> 01:02:50,760
Speaker 1: Yeah imagine the government started watching us now.

809
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:52,131
Speaker 1: We didn't make the one-time pad yet.

810
01:02:52,151 --> 01:02:56,160
Speaker 1: so when we make the one-time pad They're watching us make the one-time pad and it's useless.

811
01:02:56,741 --> 01:03:03,898
Speaker 0: Yup You have to make the one-time pad before they get their eye on us Because I was really interested in this stuff in middle and high school You made one.

812
01:03:04,381 --> 01:03:09,760
Speaker 0: I do have pre-arranged one-time codes and one-time pads with a number of people.

813
01:03:10,009 --> 01:03:11,347
Speaker 1: Sure Yeah you know.

814
01:03:11,549 --> 01:03:21,400
Speaker 1: basically think of it like this If the eye of Sauron is already upon you It sees It doesn't matter what the fuck you do.
