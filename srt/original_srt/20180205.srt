1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:18,206
Speaker 0: It's Monday February 5th 2018 on rim, I'm hungry and this is geek nights tonight M.2 and you.

2
00:00:18,246 --> 00:00:21,680
Speaker 0: we're talking about the modern state of storage for computers.

3
00:00:22,882 --> 00:00:23,897
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:25,821 --> 00:00:33,591
Speaker 0: So the other day I was sitting in the living room and I got a halogen torsier the last Halogen bulb in my apartment.

5
00:00:33,712 --> 00:00:34,436
Speaker 1: You don't need that shit.

6
00:00:34,456 --> 00:00:35,079
Speaker 1: get LED people.

7
00:00:35,703 --> 00:00:38,401
Speaker 0: No, because LED bulbs still they are good Like.

8
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:41,379
Speaker 0: I actually have an LED torsier in this room and it's really good.

9
00:00:41,964 --> 00:00:47,054
Speaker 0: But the torsier I got in the living room one I paid a lot of money for that lamp and two it's really.

10
00:00:47,074 --> 00:00:48,440
Speaker 0: it's like the perfect lamp.

11
00:00:50,123 --> 00:00:51,708
Speaker 0: No, because it doesn't have glass on top.

12
00:00:51,728 --> 00:00:52,530
Speaker 0: the way this one does.

13
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,000
Speaker 0: okay, but I was sitting there and suddenly it just goes.

14
00:00:57,701 --> 00:01:03,219
Speaker 0: Light turns off didn't explode because there's no like giant tempered glass shield on top of it.

15
00:01:03,801 --> 00:01:07,440
Speaker 0: So I go over to it and the light bulb that has had from the beginning just died.

16
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:15,654
Speaker 0: I look at it and I unlike kids younger than us who will probably not actually know how Analog like light bulbs work.

17
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,974
Speaker 0: I Know how they work and I saw the filament was just broken.

18
00:01:18,994 --> 00:01:25,486
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I never bought a new light bulb for that and let me tell you if you know if you do.

19
00:01:25,546 --> 00:01:27,653
Speaker 0: I did find one but it's it's shady.

20
00:01:28,275 --> 00:01:39,660
Speaker 0: if you need to buy a Like an Edison screw bulb for anything It's pretty easy to figure out because the only thing you need to know is that is an Edison screw of the normal size.

21
00:01:40,244 --> 00:01:41,655
Speaker 0: And then how many watts?

22
00:01:41,695 --> 00:01:42,360
Speaker 1: in other countries?

23
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:46,431
Speaker 0: They have this similar same light bulb standard and it's pretty much how many watts does it take?

24
00:01:47,313 --> 00:01:55,992
Speaker 0: if you need any sort of like Modern LED bulb usually like the bulb is not a bulb It's just LEDs that are built into the lamp.

25
00:01:56,052 --> 00:01:57,679
Speaker 0: if it dies you throw away the lamp.

26
00:01:58,762 --> 00:01:59,166
Speaker 1: There are.

27
00:01:59,267 --> 00:02:00,700
Speaker 1: I have LED bulbs in all my land.

28
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:01,140
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,012
Speaker 0: But increasingly modern lamps like this lamp.

30
00:02:03,033 --> 00:02:04,079
Speaker 0: that was not cheap either.

31
00:02:04,847 --> 00:02:08,150
Speaker 0: It the LED is just in it Like the LED is built into the land.

32
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,919
Speaker 1: not seen a lot of those and I wouldn't buy one of those.

33
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:12,058
Speaker 0: Uh, they're pretty much what you want to buy these days.

34
00:02:12,139 --> 00:02:19,879
Speaker 1: now I want to buy a normal lamp that I can put a bulb into because that way when they switch from LEDs to some new Light technology I can just screw in a different bulb.

35
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:25,720
Speaker 1: I don't think a new light technology from regular light to compact fluorescent to LED all with the same light lamp.

36
00:02:26,904 --> 00:02:29,520
Speaker 0: I don't think a new technology is on the horizon.

37
00:02:29,921 --> 00:02:35,240
Speaker 1: I think they'll make something to make a tiny Sun that you can screw in the one thing I can say a tiny star.

38
00:02:35,761 --> 00:02:41,160
Speaker 0: So why have I had two CFLs in the living room in those dim lamps?

39
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,680
Speaker 0: I use for like accent lighting and one of them died.

40
00:02:44,307 --> 00:02:55,380
Speaker 0: I didn't get a new one yet But I happen to still have one box of the last four old style Light bulbs that I own just incandescent light.

41
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:55,923
Speaker 0: I have in good.

42
00:02:55,983 --> 00:02:57,492
Speaker 0: I had a box with three.

43
00:02:57,512 --> 00:02:58,820
Speaker 1: you're gonna last like five minutes.

44
00:02:59,443 --> 00:03:01,593
Speaker 1: It's like we forget like how often those went out.

45
00:03:01,633 --> 00:03:03,060
Speaker 1: They went out all the goddamn time.

46
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,480
Speaker 1: We just are you so used to it, but like it now that we've had come back for us and like LED.

47
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:11,740
Speaker 0: No, I thought I bought that thing a fucking bulge when I moved into this.

48
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,760
Speaker 1: It's like they never they never die.

49
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,079
Speaker 1: So the idea of like a like a light bulb going out used to be a common occurrence.

50
00:03:17,139 --> 00:03:18,891
Speaker 1: now It's like super super rare.

51
00:03:19,193 --> 00:03:25,079
Speaker 0: Yep, so I didn't throw them away because they were still good, but I wasn't gonna use them.

52
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:31,000
Speaker 0: So I put the cut the the this old bulb into one of these lamps.

53
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:37,820
Speaker 0: So one of these lamps are identical lamps has a CFL like a modern one and the other one has an old incandescent bulb.

54
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:47,869
Speaker 0: All the people who say that they can tell and that the light quality is different or something No one can tell me which one is which.

55
00:03:48,271 --> 00:03:57,572
Speaker 1: no unless they go look at the bulb inside of the fix It's the same thing is like the bottle of expensive wine bottle with the man of Chevy's and it tastes Yeah, it's the same thing.

56
00:03:57,795 --> 00:04:07,660
Speaker 0: However When I try only tell the light the light the white balance, however, I tried putting in white But I tried putting an LED in one of those cuz I was gonna replace the CFL's even though we're still good with LEDs.

57
00:04:07,801 --> 00:04:09,779
Speaker 0: I did that because they just use so much less power.

58
00:04:10,881 --> 00:04:15,960
Speaker 0: The LEDs at least the ones I had which are these like daylight ones that are pretty good white light.

59
00:04:16,022 --> 00:04:16,538
Speaker 1: That's what I have.

60
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:24,700
Speaker 0: They looked pretty shit in those fixtures and you could tell because the fixtures made him have sort of this greenish greenish character.

61
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:28,535
Speaker 0: So I find I got to figure out what to do with that.

62
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,964
Speaker 0: There are LEDs I think provide.

63
00:04:30,984 --> 00:04:32,470
Speaker 1: you can just get daylight balance.

64
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,200
Speaker 1: I mean not day instead of the white daylight ones You can get the yellow more yellow.

65
00:04:36,220 --> 00:04:37,921
Speaker 0: Yeah, I gotta get a different balance But there's.

66
00:04:38,222 --> 00:04:43,600
Speaker 0: I gotta figure out if I can completely replace all my remaining CFL's with LEDs.

67
00:04:43,923 --> 00:04:44,971
Speaker 0: I've replaced most of them.

68
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:49,035
Speaker 0: one in the bedroom It's like this fucking Sun that I plugged into the top of the tertiary.

69
00:04:49,617 --> 00:04:55,700
Speaker 1: It's great But just get a light that the kind of using a driveway and that'll light up your room real good.

70
00:04:55,869 --> 00:04:56,000
Speaker 0: Yeah.

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:08,020
Speaker 0: so I think I'm talking years before that I had some xenon bulbs and some fixtures and actually replace those with LEDs because the Expensive LEDs that'll fit in those weird fixtures are way cheaper than an actual xenon bulb.

72
00:05:08,868 --> 00:05:18,359
Speaker 0: but Halogens if you don't know the codes and like what a t3 is or a fucking d15 Good luck buying a halogen bulb.

73
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:25,780
Speaker 0: But I found the one I needed from a non dodgy place and it was like eight bucks and that is way cheaper.

74
00:05:26,362 --> 00:05:32,447
Speaker 0: Then the kind of LED bulb I would need to use this kind of t3 Connector or this.

75
00:05:32,487 --> 00:05:34,160
Speaker 0: well t3 form factor.

76
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,644
Speaker 1: They're not making too many of those.

77
00:05:36,664 --> 00:05:38,028
Speaker 1: They're not exactly in high demand.

78
00:05:38,088 --> 00:05:51,620
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm gonna eventually probably buy a pure LED from the beginning light to replace this halogen but in the interim It was way cheaper to just buy this $8 halogen bulb because this halogen bulb lasted a decade.

79
00:05:51,941 --> 00:05:53,687
Speaker 0: This next one's probably gonna last another decade.

80
00:05:53,707 --> 00:05:53,988
Speaker 0: Hmm.

81
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,694
Speaker 0: That is my story.

82
00:05:55,714 --> 00:05:57,379
Speaker 0: So we got any tech news.

83
00:05:58,182 --> 00:06:03,180
Speaker 1: There is tech news, so I guess you know, there's been you know, many net neutrality talks.

84
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:06,376
Speaker 1: It's not a lot new to say but actually there was something new to say.

85
00:06:06,396 --> 00:06:13,178
Speaker 1: I told a lot Something happened that we sort of thought but we didn't know exactly how it was gonna go down.

86
00:06:13,198 --> 00:06:25,124
Speaker 1: So In the United States, I guess this we got to make this tech talk and not legal talks Context because we do have a lot of non US listeners and we got a It's.

87
00:06:25,204 --> 00:06:27,276
Speaker 0: you got to remember how kind of fucked up the u.s.

88
00:06:27,337 --> 00:06:27,618
Speaker 0: Is from.

89
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:40,719
Speaker 1: anyway There's a group called the FCC the Federal Communications Commission and they regulate, you know radio signals And cable TV and all sorts of electronic communications things telephones primarily, right?

90
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,527
Speaker 1: And that includes ISPs and Internet's.

91
00:06:43,608 --> 00:06:44,671
Speaker 1: they regulate that as well.

92
00:06:44,711 --> 00:06:47,460
Speaker 1: They make you know, they make the regulations regulatory body.

93
00:06:48,481 --> 00:06:51,395
Speaker 1: It's where if you want like a radio operators license you get it from the FCC.

94
00:06:51,495 --> 00:07:07,184
Speaker 1: Yep, so The FCC, you know against the wishes of everyone except the FCC Undid the previous net neutrality regulations that we put in recently and so now there's back to the way it was before then Which is not good

95
00:07:07,505 --> 00:07:13,760
Speaker 0: because the before then was a time when there really wasn't a modern internet and it wasn't a problem yet.

96
00:07:14,041 --> 00:07:16,732
Speaker 0: And the reason it's now actually becoming a problem.

97
00:07:16,792 --> 00:07:18,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, and we fixed it with legislation.

98
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:33,279
Speaker 1: so What happened was as we said well, you know on the one hand there's a lot of states out there that disagree And they those states, you know, such as New York want to have the old rules back But states don't have the power to do that.

99
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:38,864
Speaker 1: The federal government has the power to do that and our federal government is because it is an interstate deal Not a you know.

100
00:07:38,925 --> 00:07:40,736
Speaker 1: radio signals go across state lines.

101
00:07:40,817 --> 00:07:49,640
Speaker 1: Yep telephones make calls across state lines Across state lines and out of the country is kind of broken right now, so we can't fix it there now.

102
00:07:49,821 --> 00:08:00,100
Speaker 1: So some of the smart states found a nice loophole, which is very clever and they said, alright We can't pass some law in our state that says you have to have net neutrality to be an ISP.

103
00:08:00,304 --> 00:08:00,918
Speaker 1: We can't do that.

104
00:08:01,424 --> 00:08:08,319
Speaker 1: But what we can do is we can say this Anyone who wants to have a contract with our state to do some work or something?

105
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:14,020
Speaker 1: Must be an ISP that adheres to these principles of net neutrality.

106
00:08:14,462 --> 00:08:18,115
Speaker 1: So basically you don't have to be if you're an ISP in New York.

107
00:08:18,175 --> 00:08:19,380
Speaker 1: or what's the other state, Wisconsin?

108
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:25,440
Speaker 0: There's actually a Law makers in Montana, so it's now up to six states.

109
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,811
Speaker 0: All right, so sit one, California, New York, North Carolina, and so North Carolina, Illinois might be the seventh and eighth I guess.

110
00:08:31,996 --> 00:08:32,097
Speaker 1: okay.

111
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:35,815
Speaker 1: But anyway, a bunch of states, you know saw this trick and all decided to go in on it.

112
00:08:36,135 --> 00:08:44,720
Speaker 1: and the trick is this You you know can be an ISP and operate in New York and be very unmet neutral and you won't be breaking any laws.

113
00:08:44,900 --> 00:08:56,540
Speaker 1: But if you make a contract with New York State say to provide some service to an office of the state or who knows what Or say to use land that you're gonna run cables in that is leased from the state, right?

114
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:03,440
Speaker 1: You know you're making a contract with the state Then you either a have to abide by net neutral principles or not have your contract with the state.

115
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:07,039
Speaker 1: Just void it and the state will pay someone else for that, you know business.

116
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:14,000
Speaker 1: So yeah, that's a it's a clever move And it's gonna go to court eventually.

117
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:22,949
Speaker 1: But you know, I guess I haven't seen any unnet neutral activities on my internet yet That I could tell.

118
00:09:25,683 --> 00:09:28,244
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is though I haven't had because there was a member.

119
00:09:28,264 --> 00:09:37,916
Speaker 0: there's a period like four years ago where Netflix just wouldn't work that well in New York on Verizon Like that happened for a while, but it seemed to have calmed down.

120
00:09:37,937 --> 00:09:39,544
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's a website You can go to fat.

121
00:09:39,585 --> 00:09:40,931
Speaker 1: I think it's fast.com.

122
00:09:41,152 --> 00:09:48,640
Speaker 1: FAST like speed fast And that is a site that will test your internet speed very very easily and it is run by Netflix.

123
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,626
Speaker 0: No fancy that.

124
00:09:50,747 --> 00:09:57,219
Speaker 1: Yeah, Netflix made this site to test your internet speed And you know sort of like see if anyone is throttling the Netflix, you know

125
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:13,434
Speaker 0: this does set a sort of I don't say dangers but worrying precedent yet again that an issue in the United States is that Traditionally the only reason any state has wanted to do its own thing So-called states rights has been because of slavery or racism or religion.

126
00:10:13,555 --> 00:10:15,180
Speaker 0: It's always been the bad sides of things.

127
00:10:15,281 --> 00:10:15,366
Speaker 0: Yeah

128
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:23,320
Speaker 1: States want rights because the federal government would have Regulations that would say don't be evil and it is like what we want to be evil states rights states rights

129
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:32,246
Speaker 0: but and part of the reason why the other the correct side of the political spectrum didn't really push on those sorts of things is Complicated but they basically never did.

130
00:10:32,306 --> 00:10:35,597
Speaker 0: you very rarely had states being like we're gonna do universal health care.

131
00:10:35,637 --> 00:10:36,280
Speaker 0: Fuck y'all.

132
00:10:37,982 --> 00:10:41,280
Speaker 0: So there's it seems with technology issues in particular.

133
00:10:42,180 --> 00:11:08,799
Speaker 0: States that are on the left side are more and more willing in the United States to do stuff like this and there's a lot of reasons why that are beyond the scope of a Monday episode of geek nights, but the problem is The main reason why we I have not pushed for this too hard Is that if you let these states that are intelligent do intelligent things like this And you let the states that are have better having problems because they voted in Republicans do the opposite of that.

134
00:11:09,421 --> 00:11:15,420
Speaker 0: You're just gonna increase the divide between people with technology and without with health care and without with computers and without.

135
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,139
Speaker 1: That's gonna bring about the cyber dystopia that I've been waiting for.

136
00:11:20,724 --> 00:11:25,451
Speaker 0: Not great for most people But it's I've been preparing for ever so long I have been to.

137
00:11:25,471 --> 00:11:28,662
Speaker 1: it rewards me because that's what I invested in and counted Huh?

138
00:11:28,702 --> 00:11:30,368
Speaker 1: Well, I'm a selfish person.

139
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:32,074
Speaker 0: We're deckers and company men.

140
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:32,496
Speaker 0: We're not.

141
00:11:32,516 --> 00:11:38,517
Speaker 0: we're not like the orcs Shadow run.

142
00:11:39,722 --> 00:11:42,580
Speaker 0: It's a role-playing system where you can play an elf who is also a hacker.

143
00:11:42,921 --> 00:11:43,905
Speaker 0: I dare you to find it.

144
00:11:44,006 --> 00:11:45,572
Speaker 0: Oh and a dragon runs for president.

145
00:11:45,652 --> 00:11:47,540
Speaker 0: I dare you to define a more rim setting.

146
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,529
Speaker 1: We need the dragon president now more than ever.

147
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:51,860
Speaker 0: Yeah, I would vote dunkless on let's go.

148
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:09,112
Speaker 0: So in some other news, uh, this sort of come out that uber and lyft, you know those companies Uber more sucks less than the other one, but they both suck.

149
00:12:09,212 --> 00:12:11,560
Speaker 0: Yeah, not gonna get into why they're evil.

150
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:13,360
Speaker 0: But let's say uber is evil.

151
00:12:13,601 --> 00:12:15,568
Speaker 1: Do not use them ever.

152
00:12:15,829 --> 00:12:18,318
Speaker 1: use a legit cab or not something else.

153
00:12:18,559 --> 00:12:32,436
Speaker 0: now The hope has been that all those problems are made moot by accessible self-driving car technology Because self-driving cars mean that no one ever needs to take a cab anywhere again ever.

154
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:33,659
Speaker 0: the car itself does it?

155
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:39,718
Speaker 0: that also means that maybe for most people individual ownership of cars doesn't even matter anymore.

156
00:12:39,738 --> 00:12:45,360
Speaker 0: and There's a problem that a big part of all the employment in the United States is people driving cars.

157
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,344
Speaker 0: We've talked about all this before.

158
00:12:46,445 --> 00:12:49,037
Speaker 1: truck driver is the number one job in the country.

159
00:12:49,137 --> 00:12:55,190
Speaker 1: in most states It's the number one job and then driver of car Period is like if you employ

160
00:12:55,231 --> 00:12:57,461
Speaker 0: a huge percentage of the middle class You

161
00:12:57,502 --> 00:13:07,960
Speaker 1: eliminated all the jobs where your job is to drive There would be not like that's like a very very perhaps double-digit percent of all jobs in the United States.

162
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:37,539
Speaker 0: So it appears based on this article and some of the discussion that's been happening in the sphere lately That the company like companies like uber like uber They their endgame is to try to have regulation and urban planning and policies in place To basically ban the private use of self-driving cars Particularly in urban areas where you know the vast majority of people are.

163
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:44,936
Speaker 0: so I'm actually okay with the principle of you can't own cars anymore.

164
00:13:45,297 --> 00:13:47,003
Speaker 0: cars are Car should.

165
00:13:47,023 --> 00:14:01,260
Speaker 0: in my in my ideal future car is just one more form of mass transit that drives very small numbers of people to destinations that not very many people want to go to and handles like last mile transportation.

166
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:06,919
Speaker 0: But car should just be one more offering of the government right alongside train boss, etc.

167
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:10,340
Speaker 0: So I'm okay with not letting people own their stupid cars anymore.

168
00:14:10,983 --> 00:14:23,200
Speaker 0: I'm not okay with private company using that legislation to be the sole owner of said cars to Continue to wage its war on mass transit and modern practice.

169
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:28,000
Speaker 1: I mean even if they do do that, right and it would be it would be crappy in the short term.

170
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:32,535
Speaker 1: Yeah, but historically speaking right that you used to have private subway IRT VMT.

171
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:34,180
Speaker 0: Yeah, that was a terrible idea.

172
00:14:34,562 --> 00:14:36,771
Speaker 1: We had private train terrible idea.

173
00:14:36,831 --> 00:14:37,133
Speaker 0: Yeah.

174
00:14:37,153 --> 00:14:38,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know, we still have private plane.

175
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:40,204
Speaker 0: But yeah, you know what?

176
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:48,360
Speaker 1: Maybe we shouldn't know but the point is is that over time because they were so terrible They became not so public anymore, right?

177
00:14:49,963 --> 00:14:59,570
Speaker 1: Even if we let uber do this, it's like well, it'll just get nationalized eventually At least to the Amtrak level of nationalization,

178
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:30,740
Speaker 0: yeah, but I guess from a technology standpoint The the thing self-driving cars are still gonna be crazy disruptive and that this is yet an example of one more way They're gonna be disruptive that a lot of people are not even thinking about whether or not private car ownership even matters and whether or not large conglomerate companies might use legislation ostensibly promoting better technology governance governance to in fact just control and industry as a private contractor.

179
00:15:32,581 --> 00:15:36,420
Speaker 0: So in some other news, we got to talk about this because everyone was talking about it.

180
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,608
Speaker 0: It was kind of a big deal.

181
00:15:37,628 --> 00:15:38,514
Speaker 1: too much news going on.

182
00:15:38,635 --> 00:15:41,163
Speaker 0: Yeah We got.

183
00:15:41,183 --> 00:15:42,387
Speaker 0: let's see how that goes.

184
00:15:42,668 --> 00:15:45,017
Speaker 0: you want to not talk about the Hawaii missile alert.

185
00:15:45,198 --> 00:15:48,380
Speaker 1: It's not that big You know, I feel like it's a. it's a. it's a beaten bush.

186
00:15:48,802 --> 00:15:49,405
Speaker 0: I feel it wasn't.

187
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:50,290
Speaker 0: it's partly.

188
00:15:50,330 --> 00:15:52,100
Speaker 0: we just didn't do a geek nights around when it happened.

189
00:15:52,980 --> 00:16:01,060
Speaker 0: But basically if you lived in Hawaii You got a legit notification from the government on your phone that said there's a fucking missile coming.

190
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:10,640
Speaker 0: This is not a drill and Because of the way the government works that was not corrected for what like 40 minutes too long?

191
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:13,568
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've 40 seconds might have been too long.

192
00:16:14,069 --> 00:16:28,050
Speaker 0: any number of seconds is too long, but the original story that came out I think the joke I saw on every UX designers Twitter was well I'm making a slide about this in my next TED talk Blamed it on the UI which is of course an awful UI.

193
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:43,317
Speaker 1: the UI is atrocious the UX is atrocious Yeah, but I mean that's you know Because the only there are very few companies in very few situations where people producing software Right have a culture of valuing designing UI for example Apple.

194
00:16:43,477 --> 00:16:44,180
Speaker 1: obvious, right?

195
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:50,400
Speaker 1: But most places that produce software do not have a culture appreciation or care for design.

196
00:16:50,481 --> 00:16:51,990
Speaker 1: They just may it works.

197
00:16:52,191 --> 00:16:53,580
Speaker 1: You know, it's just a bunch of text on the screen.

198
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,182
Speaker 1: Don't give a fuck.

199
00:16:54,242 --> 00:16:56,530
Speaker 1: They don't even care or think about it.

200
00:16:56,872 --> 00:16:59,220
Speaker 1: It's not even a matter of like being bad at designing, right?

201
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:02,272
Speaker 1: It's like they actually don't care or even think about like.

202
00:17:02,292 --> 00:17:03,295
Speaker 1: design is not a step.

203
00:17:03,657 --> 00:17:05,041
Speaker 1: Yep, right It's like.

204
00:17:05,303 --> 00:17:08,733
Speaker 0: but UX user experience goes one step behind just the design of a GUI.

205
00:17:08,773 --> 00:17:23,295
Speaker 0: because yeah, this GUI is awful but the entire Process and procedures around something are also part of the user experience and the process here was bad And the the rules people had to follow were.

206
00:17:23,396 --> 00:17:26,980
Speaker 0: it seems like Everything was bad in this situation.

207
00:17:28,142 --> 00:17:31,754
Speaker 0: So this outcome was basically inevitable and I am shocked.

208
00:17:31,814 --> 00:17:32,978
Speaker 0: It did not happen sooner.

209
00:17:32,998 --> 00:17:41,120
Speaker 0: Yeah I Guess the only point I really got here is that this is not just the story of a poorly designed menu caused a missile alert.

210
00:17:41,443 --> 00:17:43,199
Speaker 0: No, the story here is that?

211
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:44,261
Speaker 0: GUIs.

212
00:17:44,804 --> 00:17:46,029
Speaker 0: GUIs can prevent.

213
00:17:46,671 --> 00:17:50,819
Speaker 0: our GUIs can mitigate or Minimize the chance of mistakes being made.

214
00:17:51,523 --> 00:17:55,240
Speaker 0: UX design can also mitigate and minimize the chances of these things happening.

215
00:17:55,701 --> 00:18:00,135
Speaker 0: but the story of bad decisions like this is always bigger than you think.

216
00:18:00,536 --> 00:18:04,150
Speaker 0: and don't drill it down to One slide in some UX designers.

217
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,620
Speaker 0: talk at some TEDx that you're gonna see next month.

218
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:10,660
Speaker 1: I mean, it's just a question if I you know, we know how to design something, right?

219
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:15,198
Speaker 1: You go to design places and it's like they always talk about how to design things better how to get a topography.

220
00:18:15,239 --> 00:18:16,082
Speaker 1: good It's like.

221
00:18:16,424 --> 00:18:20,360
Speaker 1: but everyone there is someone who already cares about design, right and also they tend to care.

222
00:18:21,342 --> 00:18:29,214
Speaker 1: If you got someone who's painting Warhammer miniatures, right and it's like oh and they're trying to do better at it You can show them techniques like oh, he's had a dry brush.

223
00:18:29,254 --> 00:18:30,260
Speaker 1: Here's how to do that, right?

224
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,000
Speaker 1: Oh, here's how to apply the primer better, right?

225
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:37,940
Speaker 1: But if there's somebody who literally takes a can of red spray paint goes I'm done and like just doesn't give a fuck.

226
00:18:38,482 --> 00:18:39,425
Speaker 1: It's like how.

227
00:18:39,625 --> 00:18:40,528
Speaker 1: it's like what do you?

228
00:18:40,568 --> 00:18:44,100
Speaker 1: that's what you have most of the time in software production, right?

229
00:18:44,542 --> 00:18:52,933
Speaker 1: And it's not really a problem if someone does that in Warhammer cuz it's like, alright, that's what you like, bro I mean whatever right but it's a problem when you're hurt.

230
00:18:53,013 --> 00:19:05,620
Speaker 1: any missile alert system for Hawaii It doesn't hurt anyone but a badly designed software Even if it is technically speaking in the code bug free the poor design could actually cause bugs.

231
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:07,897
Speaker 1: Yeah, I cut it pebkek.

232
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:12,877
Speaker 0: So and you cannot assume that a user is going to follow a procedure.

233
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:13,500
Speaker 0: do the right thing.

234
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:25,306
Speaker 0: So a user experience has to take into account all of human failings and mitigate those things like say There's a situation where you have a UX that gates people to prevent Common mistakes from being made.

235
00:19:25,607 --> 00:19:31,086
Speaker 0: like if they try like the if you wanna send a real missile alert You got to click on it.

236
00:19:31,126 --> 00:19:49,239
Speaker 0: Like you got to do a confirmation thing of some kind You also have to assume that someone's going to go one step further and do all of that and then continue to proceed in making Their terrible mistake, so maybe you need a way to undo it a break glass Like you got a thing a lot of steps deeper than even a lot of UX designers do.

237
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:51,945
Speaker 0: Last and least.

238
00:19:52,246 --> 00:19:53,249
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, come on.

239
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:54,454
Speaker 1: There's not tech news round up here.

240
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:55,979
Speaker 0: This is kind of amazing.

241
00:19:56,820 --> 00:20:00,272
Speaker 0: Best Buy announced that they're no longer going to sell physical CDs.

242
00:20:00,313 --> 00:20:01,176
Speaker 1: They still sell CDs.

243
00:20:01,537 --> 00:20:02,360
Speaker 0: That's the news.

244
00:20:02,922 --> 00:20:06,275
Speaker 0: I am shocked that any big stores sell CDs.

245
00:20:06,476 --> 00:20:06,797
Speaker 1: I'm shocked.

246
00:20:06,837 --> 00:20:07,540
Speaker 1: anyone buys CDs.

247
00:20:07,741 --> 00:20:11,719
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't own a CD player, I don't think.

248
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:16,824
Speaker 1: Yeah, I can play one in my In my computer.

249
00:20:17,045 --> 00:20:19,353
Speaker 0: Oh, I still have my Fujitsu lifebook.

250
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:21,060
Speaker 0: It has an optical drive in it.

251
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,365
Speaker 1: Yeah, I have an optical drive.

252
00:20:22,445 --> 00:20:25,236
Speaker 0: I also have one optical USB drive for emergencies.

253
00:20:25,296 --> 00:20:26,180
Speaker 0: I guess I could play a CD.

254
00:20:26,281 --> 00:20:29,629
Speaker 1: I'm here cleaning up my The Connecticut house this weekend.

255
00:20:29,649 --> 00:20:30,533
Speaker 1: I found two disc men.

256
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:31,579
Speaker 1: I don't know if they worked or not.

257
00:20:31,941 --> 00:20:40,213
Speaker 0: yeah, didn't care throw them out, but it seems like everyone's moving to streaming and Hardly anyone seems to care about owning music.

258
00:20:40,234 --> 00:20:45,520
Speaker 0: streaming seems to be good enough And I think the whole industry is gonna have to align itself a hundred percent around streaming.

259
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:47,746
Speaker 0: Well ninety percent around streaming.

260
00:20:47,826 --> 00:20:50,995
Speaker 0: ten percent around collectors that you can milk for a lot of money.

261
00:20:51,035 --> 00:20:57,283
Speaker 1: There is a niche industry Going on like the lossless players There.

262
00:20:57,444 --> 00:21:00,233
Speaker 1: first of all, there are people who are stupid and collect vinyls.

263
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:02,360
Speaker 1: Yep, right of new things for some reason.

264
00:21:03,742 --> 00:21:12,020
Speaker 0: Okay, whatever you like bro you like music Go be my don't collect CDs though CDs will actually like they wear out like they'll just start flaking and they're dead.

265
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:25,000
Speaker 1: no, but there are people who are I see this in kpop a lot is they'll produce albums where they have like Photobooks and a big, you know, it won't be in a plastic jewel case It's like a big cardboard thing with all sorts of shit in there.

266
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,967
Speaker 1: Yeah actors crap, right sort of like.

267
00:21:26,987 --> 00:21:32,727
Speaker 1: I used to buy anime DVDs and they would come with plush plushies Underwear and action figures.

268
00:21:32,768 --> 00:21:33,310
Speaker 0: Where is it?

269
00:21:33,350 --> 00:21:35,220
Speaker 0: I still got the eye of Vogler somewhere, right?

270
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:35,884
Speaker 1: That kind of thing.

271
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:38,100
Speaker 1: So imagine if albums all came in eye of Vogler.

272
00:21:38,421 --> 00:21:39,445
Speaker 1: that's what kpop is like.

273
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:43,581
Speaker 1: so you'll buy them if you're a fan of that group and you won't listen to the music on the CD.

274
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:48,561
Speaker 1: you stream the music or watch it on YouTube right to get views up here to make Popular.

275
00:21:48,942 --> 00:21:56,293
Speaker 1: but you know people buy those to collect them as things just to have things because they're materialistic collecting people who I guess That's not good.

276
00:21:57,188 --> 00:22:05,266
Speaker 0: yep, so It's kind of amazing that this long tail lasted so long as people buy in CDs and Surprised it was worth the shelf space.

277
00:22:05,527 --> 00:22:12,440
Speaker 0: I think it's partly that it takes a long time for retail like big retail Organizations to change anything that they're doing.

278
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:15,968
Speaker 0: Yeah Cuz I'm sure there's some whole workflow around.

279
00:22:16,008 --> 00:22:21,023
Speaker 0: like CDs get shipped in bulk and then like with comics and things some things can't be Shipped back.

280
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:23,280
Speaker 1: and I was like about CEO best buy right?

281
00:22:23,381 --> 00:22:29,449
Speaker 1: When was the last time I Scott bought or listened to music on a CD?

282
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:33,628
Speaker 1: probably sometime in Beacon before when I had the car before.

283
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:36,660
Speaker 0: it's the last time my car my CD player didn't work in my car at any point.

284
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:41,179
Speaker 1: We lived before I plug the I've got the thing to plug the iPod into the car.

285
00:22:41,581 --> 00:22:53,680
Speaker 1: I use CDs in the car right as soon as I stopped using CDs period Which is I guess 10 plus years ago 2004 I think is the last time I listened to music from a red book CD, right?

286
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:54,342
Speaker 1: Something like that.

287
00:22:54,362 --> 00:22:55,708
Speaker 1: That's when they should have stopped selling them.

288
00:22:56,170 --> 00:22:58,460
Speaker 1: as soon as you stop using them like, huh?

289
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:06,600
Speaker 0: I'm the CEO of Best Buy Because you should stop selling these if you are wealthier you're probably an early adopter.

290
00:23:06,701 --> 00:23:12,640
Speaker 0: I mean my family actually like we Reinvested and saved and bought a CD player in the early days to add to the high-five system.

291
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:24,151
Speaker 0: Anyone, you know use the CD but tapes continued to be sold and popular for a long time After CDs were introduced and I didn't even know.

292
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:25,977
Speaker 1: I didn't even know who's still buying DVDs and blu-rays.

293
00:23:26,037 --> 00:23:26,880
Speaker 1: I'd stop selling those.

294
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:28,346
Speaker 0: Yeah, a lot of people.

295
00:23:28,366 --> 00:23:29,631
Speaker 0: I see them in my Anna Twitter feed.

296
00:23:29,651 --> 00:23:32,040
Speaker 1: Mostly I think they're doing the collectors item biz.

297
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,006
Speaker 1: I don't think they're actually.

298
00:23:33,428 --> 00:23:33,690
Speaker 0: actually.

299
00:23:33,730 --> 00:23:46,769
Speaker 0: a lot of them are buying shows and Then laughing at people later when those shows are taken off a streaming platforms And there's literally nowhere to watch them and the physical media is sold out and you try to pirate them and like they're not even Easily pirated cuz no one gave a shit.

300
00:23:47,372 --> 00:23:49,302
Speaker 1: if no one gives a shit then that's not a show We're not?

301
00:23:49,322 --> 00:23:53,907
Speaker 0: I need to see yeah, but I thought like I thought name a show I is.

302
00:23:54,028 --> 00:23:59,593
Speaker 0: I couldn't find an easy Torrent of my hood sky tie the original you have that I already.

303
00:23:59,613 --> 00:24:01,600
Speaker 0: yet cuz I pirated it and I kept it.

304
00:24:01,800 --> 00:24:02,905
Speaker 0: What if I hadn't kept it?

305
00:24:03,146 --> 00:24:06,318
Speaker 0: and today I was like man, I should really watch my hood sky time.

306
00:24:06,358 --> 00:24:06,880
Speaker 0: Good luck with them.

307
00:24:07,042 --> 00:24:15,960
Speaker 0: Yeah, might be tough But anyway things of the day.

308
00:24:16,584 --> 00:24:19,260
Speaker 0: So this video is called why the metric system matters.

309
00:24:19,361 --> 00:24:22,638
Speaker 0: But what it really is about is it talks about a bunch of different like?

310
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:25,840
Speaker 0: Measuring and counting systems and a bunch of historical stuff.

311
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:37,315
Speaker 0: It's a pretty good video goes a little more depth than a lot of you probably encountered before but it explains something That I didn't really know and I realized that no one around me seems to know.

312
00:24:37,335 --> 00:24:40,951
Speaker 0: so Scott American shoe sizes.

313
00:24:41,516 --> 00:24:43,358
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm How the fuck do they work?

314
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,339
Speaker 1: They're just slightly different from the European ones like half half up.

315
00:24:48,364 --> 00:24:56,454
Speaker 0: Europe uses pretty much just metric now number of centimeters There's like no the UK ones were half up from yeah, cuz you just know the US are you.

316
00:24:56,755 --> 00:24:58,280
Speaker 0: but anyway, why?

317
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,206
Speaker 0: What what is a 10 mean?

318
00:25:00,266 --> 00:25:01,733
Speaker 0: and what versus a 10 and a half like?

319
00:25:01,753 --> 00:25:03,159
Speaker 0: what is that system based on?

320
00:25:04,160 --> 00:25:10,340
Speaker 1: Probably they was probably someone's foot and they were like well that foot is X and there's probably something cobblers did and measured with.

321
00:25:11,083 --> 00:25:13,997
Speaker 1: So funny that my thing of the day also involves cobbling.

322
00:25:14,198 --> 00:25:23,086
Speaker 0: oh, yeah because I actually like the American system for purely selfish selfish reasons because my shoe size is Exactly a u.s.

323
00:25:23,086 --> 00:25:24,231
Speaker 0: 10 and a half.

324
00:25:24,291 --> 00:25:26,380
Speaker 1: mine change mine depends on the shoe company.

325
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:27,524
Speaker 1: It's like if it's a Nike.

326
00:25:27,545 --> 00:25:31,541
Speaker 1: shoe is usually 12, but like some other companies could be 11 11.

327
00:25:31,541 --> 00:25:33,246
Speaker 0: I mean if I buy quality shoes like.

328
00:25:33,287 --> 00:25:36,277
Speaker 0: I don't buy shoes from weird places, but I think I bought.

329
00:25:36,297 --> 00:25:37,180
Speaker 1: I bought some dress shoes.

330
00:25:38,282 --> 00:25:40,571
Speaker 0: My ten and a half is like spot-on.

331
00:25:40,611 --> 00:25:50,267
Speaker 0: it's always different from different company, but That system is actually based on a specific unit of measure Called the barley corn.

332
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:50,929
Speaker 0: Okay.

333
00:25:51,170 --> 00:25:51,611
Speaker 0: It's how many?

334
00:25:51,872 --> 00:25:54,360
Speaker 0: I guess it's how many barley corns long your foot is.

335
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,365
Speaker 0: Anyway, this video is pretty interesting.

336
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:57,588
Speaker 1: I'll use barley corns.

337
00:25:58,109 --> 00:26:02,600
Speaker 0: Uh, yeah, it's American shoe sizes much like American acres.

338
00:26:03,303 --> 00:26:12,638
Speaker 0: Seem to be based on some of the oldest units of measure that are still in common use today Because we have these like meta systems that are actually based on these old systems.

339
00:26:12,658 --> 00:26:12,999
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

340
00:26:13,862 --> 00:26:15,500
Speaker 0: Anyway, so what's your shoe related thing?

341
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,028
Speaker 1: So I found out about.

342
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:22,401
Speaker 1: you know, I've always thought like hey, you know There used to be cobblers about but now there aren't really cobblers Like.

343
00:26:22,421 --> 00:26:28,200
Speaker 1: the only cobbling that goes on these days is like shoe shining replace shoelaces and maybe replace a soul and that's about it.

344
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:35,030
Speaker 1: I mean I had some Birkenstocks and I wanted to get him fixed and usually in the city It'll be like shoe and watch repair place.

345
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:42,817
Speaker 1: the cobbler wanted like 80% of the price of new shoes And whatever all-in-one anyway, so I was like you can't really.

346
00:26:43,138 --> 00:26:46,760
Speaker 1: I always thought well You can't really cobble like sneakers the shoes that people actually wear, right?

347
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:48,620
Speaker 1: It's pretty much just dress shoes and boots and stuff.

348
00:26:48,660 --> 00:27:00,120
Speaker 1: But I would have thought without this video who even cares you buy another whatever the current Nike is and just move on Right, but no There's this kid in Chicago and I think his dad and also his grandpa were cobblers and he is also a cobbler.

349
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:09,307
Speaker 1: He's the teen cobbler almost like a superhero teen cobbler and he may has a store called fix yo kicks Which is fucking awesome.

350
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:17,110
Speaker 0: I did not take into account the people who want to keep their old Non leather shoes together.

351
00:27:17,331 --> 00:27:19,240
Speaker 1: sneakers are a big craze for the past.

352
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,928
Speaker 1: You know X years right.

353
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:23,600
Speaker 0: or if you live in the rest of the country tennis shoes anyway.

354
00:27:24,835 --> 00:27:29,718
Speaker 1: and or kicks Kid in Chicago you bring him like your Jordans for the 90s.

355
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:34,820
Speaker 1: He'll make them look new even though they're from the 90s or whatever and it's like that's fucking awesome.

356
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:35,867
Speaker 1: I wish I had that kid.

357
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,760
Speaker 1: Yeah, I hope it's cheaper to bring him.

358
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,448
Speaker 1: You know, I guess you're only bringing shoes to him.

359
00:27:39,488 --> 00:27:42,803
Speaker 1: if they're you know, ultra rare coca beans I would take him cuz.

360
00:27:42,823 --> 00:27:45,555
Speaker 0: I got my Nike like for whatever free running shoes.

361
00:27:45,575 --> 00:27:46,600
Speaker 1: I don't know if you can fix those.

362
00:27:46,921 --> 00:27:51,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'd be curious because the new ones are great for running but there was one.

363
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:52,927
Speaker 1: It'd be cheaper to just buy new ones.

364
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:53,751
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, but they're different.

365
00:27:53,771 --> 00:27:54,958
Speaker 0: I wear them for running.

366
00:27:54,998 --> 00:27:55,400
Speaker 0: I wear them out.

367
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:56,298
Speaker 0: I don't care what they look like.

368
00:27:56,801 --> 00:28:03,942
Speaker 0: But there was one year where they looked really good and I got a pair of those that are not looking so great and you Can't get those anymore.

369
00:28:04,603 --> 00:28:05,766
Speaker 0: If he could make those look good.

370
00:28:05,806 --> 00:28:07,189
Speaker 0: I would pay a reasonable amount of money.

371
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:09,928
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Yeah, that's kids.

372
00:28:10,008 --> 00:28:10,270
Speaker 1: Awesome.

373
00:28:10,371 --> 00:28:21,050
Speaker 0: Yeah in the meta moment The book club book is Emily Wilson's translation of the Odyssey by Homa Homa But really probably more by Emily Wilson, I'm guessing.

374
00:28:21,151 --> 00:28:23,679
Speaker 1: well, I don't know how much is how much is what?

375
00:28:23,719 --> 00:28:25,809
Speaker 0: well It's a new interpretation.

376
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:27,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, we'll discuss that when we do the book club.

377
00:28:28,081 --> 00:28:30,735
Speaker 0: Yeah, the previous book club book is it's still on.

378
00:28:30,755 --> 00:28:46,373
Speaker 0: the website was Nk jemisin is the fifth season and I just want to reiterate again If you didn't read that book you should go back and read it because the fifth season and the trilogy it's part of is real fucking good and More and more people around me are reading it because the book club.

379
00:28:46,634 --> 00:28:47,318
Speaker 0: so you should too.

380
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:52,596
Speaker 0: Otherwise if you saw us at packs unplugged the video of our talk is on YouTube.

381
00:28:53,018 --> 00:28:56,828
Speaker 0: if you saw us impact South the video of our talk is on YouTube.

382
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:02,122
Speaker 0: if you saw us at magfest the video of one of our talks is on YouTube.

383
00:29:02,764 --> 00:29:09,625
Speaker 0: and if you a long time ago saw our judge anime by its cover and anime Boston the video of us doing it At Scott's apartment for the fall 2017 season.

384
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:10,087
Speaker 0: anime winter 2018.

385
00:29:10,087 --> 00:29:10,468
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah winter 2018.

386
00:29:10,468 --> 00:29:11,171
Speaker 0: This is one older.

387
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:15,288
Speaker 0: Anyway, it is on YouTube.

388
00:29:15,409 --> 00:29:16,253
Speaker 1: the fall 2017 also is on YouTube.

389
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:21,739
Speaker 0: That's all of these are on YouTube and you can enjoy them.

390
00:29:23,231 --> 00:29:32,427
Speaker 0: So We haven't actually talked about like how hard drives work in the modern era as far as a consumer would care like Episode and SSDs.

391
00:29:32,467 --> 00:29:33,130
Speaker 1: I don't remember.

392
00:29:33,231 --> 00:29:33,934
Speaker 0: pretty sure we did.

393
00:29:33,994 --> 00:29:35,420
Speaker 0: we I'll dig some of that up.

394
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,008
Speaker 1: I mean we can just briefly go over right?

395
00:29:37,028 --> 00:29:38,918
Speaker 1: So when I first built a computer it was ATA.

396
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:47,485
Speaker 1: You had a ribbon cable and a molex 4-pin connector that went into that hard drive and spinning magnetic platters and read heads That would zip across them.

397
00:29:47,827 --> 00:29:50,720
Speaker 1: Right and that was a hard drive and there was no other kind of hard drive.

398
00:29:50,981 --> 00:29:51,463
Speaker 1: that was it.

399
00:29:51,884 --> 00:29:54,353
Speaker 1: and they were slow and they got faster over time.

400
00:29:54,393 --> 00:30:01,840
Speaker 1: and they changed it from IDE to SAT and SAT was better because it was faster and it didn't use a stupid ribbon cable used a much smaller cable.

401
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,582
Speaker 1: That was way better.

402
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:05,530
Speaker 1: Yep, and it was cereal in general.

403
00:30:05,550 --> 00:30:26,759
Speaker 0: There's been a move away from at least outside of Tightly controlled environments like on your motherboard with CPUs and everything, but you move to Serial interfaces for connectivity to slower things as opposed to parallel because it's really hard to keep those bits in sync in Parallel unless you can parallelize the workflow which for hard drives until recently you could not do

404
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:27,200
Speaker 1: anyway.

405
00:30:27,361 --> 00:30:30,917
Speaker 1: So then we had to SAT a and there's also a better power connector.

406
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:32,223
Speaker 1: not and it was smaller.

407
00:30:32,283 --> 00:30:35,277
Speaker 1: and you can get smaller drives because the connectors are smaller.

408
00:30:35,377 --> 00:30:37,752
Speaker 1: and you know The drives got better and so on.

409
00:30:37,792 --> 00:30:41,167
Speaker 1: and then you know The idea of the SSD was always there.

410
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:44,739
Speaker 1: people would like get a ton of RAM which meant like 32 megabytes of RAM.

411
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,356
Speaker 1: Yeah, and they would make a RAM drive, right?

412
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:56,740
Speaker 1: That would only last while the computer was on but they tried to keep the computer on a long time You know or people would get a whole bunch of RAM sticks and put them on a PCI card and make a drive.

413
00:30:57,041 --> 00:31:05,320
Speaker 1: You know out of RAM, you know some way because it's you know, it's solid-state storage meaning You know magnets is not solid-state, right?

414
00:31:05,581 --> 00:31:09,414
Speaker 1: It's it's a chip, you know that we're like an SD card.

415
00:31:09,454 --> 00:31:11,220
Speaker 1: that's solid-state like flash storage.

416
00:31:11,521 --> 00:31:13,991
Speaker 1: All right, if you want to know what's actually happening there.

417
00:31:14,392 --> 00:31:15,838
Speaker 1: It's like you had to go look that up.

418
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:17,145
Speaker 1: I'm sorry That's not what the show's about.

419
00:31:17,226 --> 00:31:17,447
Speaker 1: Yep.

420
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:19,339
Speaker 1: Also, I can't explain it to ya

421
00:31:20,603 --> 00:31:38,990
Speaker 0: and what's interesting is actually this stuff in general like This the protocols and how things work and like all the details have actually gotten way More complex around PC storage than they were back when I paid attention because I was like Meticulously researching how to build PCs.

422
00:31:39,151 --> 00:31:45,300
Speaker 1: Yep, but eventually we had SSDs But they were crazy expensive and small and they're still more expensive and have less storage.

423
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:52,746
Speaker 1: You still sometimes need magnet drives if you need a ton of storage like terabytes, but we have the SSDs now They're the size of laptop hard drives.

424
00:31:52,786 --> 00:31:54,834
Speaker 1: They connect to that same SATA.

425
00:31:54,854 --> 00:31:58,588
Speaker 1: It goes up to six gigabits per second You know and that's still.

426
00:31:58,628 --> 00:32:02,566
Speaker 1: we got and it's still great and people still use it But it wasn't fast enough.

427
00:32:02,606 --> 00:32:07,200
Speaker 1: We sorted the SATA couldn't really get any faster even though the SSDs could go faster.

428
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:13,519
Speaker 1: So on your computer on your motherboard this PCI Express slots and no one's really using those except to hold video cards.

429
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,127
Speaker 0: now It's interesting.

430
00:32:14,148 --> 00:32:21,960
Speaker 0: remember in the old day There was ISA and PCI and AGP and all these slots where you could use a protocol to connect things to your computer.

431
00:32:22,100 --> 00:32:28,300
Speaker 0: Yep, generic things like a card that does USB or a sound card or a video card or a network card.

432
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:30,160
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're putting a board in your computer that gives you shit.

433
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:36,562
Speaker 1: But now they slowly added all those things to the CPU and the motherboard and the bridge North bridge the South bridge Whatever.

434
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,252
Speaker 1: So now your motherboard has a sound card.

435
00:32:38,273 --> 00:32:39,460
Speaker 1: You don't put a sound card in there.

436
00:32:39,581 --> 00:32:41,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, your motherboard has like one or two network ports.

437
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,059
Speaker 1: You don't add a network card.

438
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:48,920
Speaker 1: So like the motherboards even mini ICX ones have like fucking everything on them and no one needed to put cards.

439
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:50,046
Speaker 1: You know everyone used USB.

440
00:32:50,066 --> 00:32:51,695
Speaker 1: They didn't need a game card to connect.

441
00:32:51,715 --> 00:32:53,783
Speaker 1: their game can tell again USB.

442
00:32:54,064 --> 00:32:59,740
Speaker 0: the big deal with USB is that it was a serial protocol as opposed to a parallel protocol.

443
00:32:59,941 --> 00:33:02,891
Speaker 1: We stopped needing to use those slots.

444
00:33:03,071 --> 00:33:05,680
Speaker 1: So some people got a bunch of video cards.

445
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:07,247
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz they had too much money.

446
00:33:07,549 --> 00:33:09,980
Speaker 0: Some people like me have a firewire card or something weird.

447
00:33:10,261 --> 00:33:13,520
Speaker 1: Yeah, but most people put in one video card and had a bunch of empty slots.

448
00:33:13,761 --> 00:33:16,410
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the thing is the way.

449
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:26,452
Speaker 1: the way the PCI Express works is that it's crazy fast obviously, that's why your video card connects to it, but There's only so much bandwidth there just like anything else this bandwidth.

450
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,520
Speaker 1: You couldn't put a hundred video cards in there.

451
00:33:28,681 --> 00:33:31,099
Speaker 1: They wouldn't be enough, you know bits to go around, right?

452
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,700
Speaker 0: Yep, so now not to get into the details just kind of beyond the scope of this.

453
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:40,989
Speaker 0: But that's why you'll see like you plug in one video card and it runs at 16 But if you would in two, it's eight and eight.

454
00:33:41,270 --> 00:33:41,491
Speaker 1: Yep.

455
00:33:42,094 --> 00:33:47,873
Speaker 1: Anyway, so What they call this is what channels you have so many PCI channels something like that.

456
00:33:48,234 --> 00:33:49,759
Speaker 1: I forget what it is lanes.

457
00:33:49,839 --> 00:33:51,498
Speaker 1: lanes That's what they call it lanes.

458
00:33:52,142 --> 00:34:05,125
Speaker 1: So your motherboard and your CPU have so a limited number of PCI lanes and you can only you know Once you've used those lanes up you can't add any more cards or anything else to use PCI Express Even if you got vacant slots, right?

459
00:34:05,827 --> 00:34:10,820
Speaker 1: So they're like, well, that's faster than SAT a. why don't we go borrow some of them?

460
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:11,607
Speaker 1: They're lanes.

461
00:34:11,768 --> 00:34:15,849
Speaker 1: so you could get Solid-state drives that plug in the PCI Express slot.

462
00:34:16,069 --> 00:34:19,060
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's kind of silly, but it works and it's really fast.

463
00:34:19,301 --> 00:34:28,280
Speaker 0: So, okay sure and there's all these other ways to do fast storage that are Enterprise only server only way beyond the scope of what we're gonna talk about today, right?

464
00:34:28,621 --> 00:34:29,362
Speaker 1: But what eventually?

465
00:34:29,402 --> 00:34:33,815
Speaker 1: what they currently have the latest and greatest technology is the m.2 slot.

466
00:34:34,117 --> 00:34:35,120
Speaker 0: now, this is important.

467
00:34:35,221 --> 00:34:41,572
Speaker 0: This is kind of why we're doing this show a lot of people Confused thinking because SATA was sort of.

468
00:34:41,592 --> 00:34:50,120
Speaker 0: I mean there were all their form factors for SATA But SATA for all intents and purposes was both the form factor for the cabling and the protocol.

469
00:34:50,302 --> 00:34:52,223
Speaker 1: Yeah up until now It was pretty much.

470
00:34:52,565 --> 00:34:56,100
Speaker 1: you plug stuff in where it fits and it works and you don't have to think about it.

471
00:34:57,081 --> 00:35:11,480
Speaker 1: M2 it makes, you know configuring the PC and the storage a little weird Compared to before and there's like a lot of weird stuff going on that you won't know unless you've been educated because m.2 is Literally just the form factor.

472
00:35:12,002 --> 00:35:13,667
Speaker 0: They basically needed a way.

473
00:35:14,008 --> 00:35:18,344
Speaker 0: the fact that you're like hard drives were pretty big in the old days and the old days They're even bigger.

474
00:35:18,827 --> 00:35:22,544
Speaker 0: but nowadays if it's not a spinning disk It's really just.

475
00:35:22,584 --> 00:35:23,488
Speaker 0: it can be a like.

476
00:35:24,010 --> 00:35:26,580
Speaker 0: look at a micro SD card like storage can be really tiny.

477
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:28,790
Speaker 1: They have a micro SD cards at like 512 megabytes.

478
00:35:29,212 --> 00:35:30,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like holy shit.

479
00:35:31,182 --> 00:35:40,948
Speaker 0: so it's like it's like smaller than a cornflake, but the Form factor of plugging in like SATA or all these other ways Didn't really make sense.

480
00:35:41,169 --> 00:35:43,560
Speaker 0: to have just like this tiny little chip sticking out of the end.

481
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:46,913
Speaker 1: You open up your solid-state drive and it's like two and a half inches.

482
00:35:46,974 --> 00:35:47,556
Speaker 1: you look inside.

483
00:35:47,576 --> 00:35:48,480
Speaker 1: There's almost nothing in there.

484
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:56,073
Speaker 0: Yep, and for most people who aren't building a giant desktop computer because desktops really are not like workstations are not a thing for most People anymore.

485
00:35:56,257 --> 00:35:58,640
Speaker 0: Nope You want you wanted a form factor?

486
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,497
Speaker 0: To be able to just put a hard drive into some small computer in a modern way.

487
00:36:03,537 --> 00:36:04,160
Speaker 0: that made sense.

488
00:36:04,180 --> 00:36:08,209
Speaker 1: Yeah for the way computers are used today It's like other than the power supply in the video card.

489
00:36:08,570 --> 00:36:10,920
Speaker 1: literally the motherboard in the CPU is the whole computer.

490
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:16,839
Speaker 1: So you could get mini ITX computers and like make really flat cases if you could somehow get rid of that stuff.

491
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:23,680
Speaker 1: and the hard Drive, you know, even the two and a half inch SSDs We're you know, really gumming up the works in terms of making the flat computer.

492
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:29,680
Speaker 0: So as a result, my hard drive is smaller than one of my RAM chips and it's just plugged into the light.

493
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:34,100
Speaker 1: It's like it's like a stick of gum, but slightly bigger maybe like smaller than a bookmark.

494
00:36:35,563 --> 00:36:36,069
Speaker 1: It's small.

495
00:36:36,211 --> 00:36:36,312
Speaker 1: Yep.

496
00:36:36,332 --> 00:36:37,000
Speaker 1: All right.

497
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:42,137
Speaker 1: So m2 refers to just the physical slot on the motherboard that these things go into.

498
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:42,840
Speaker 1: right.

499
00:36:43,361 --> 00:36:45,928
Speaker 1: Well, it's which is separate from what it's actually doing.

500
00:36:46,008 --> 00:36:55,107
Speaker 1: so an m2 slot and most motherboards you're gonna buy today can actually work either in SATA mode or PCI Express mode.

501
00:36:55,127 --> 00:36:56,833
Speaker 1: so you plug a thing into it a drive.

502
00:36:56,853 --> 00:36:58,319
Speaker 1: you get an m2 drive and plug it in.

503
00:36:58,881 --> 00:37:03,200
Speaker 1: That drive might be using SATA or it might be using PCI Express.

504
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:07,896
Speaker 0: This is why you gotta read the manual for your motherboard and the specs.

505
00:37:07,957 --> 00:37:11,530
Speaker 1: if you're buying the drive You might buy a drive that doesn't do PCI Express.

506
00:37:11,571 --> 00:37:12,193
Speaker 1: you plug it in.

507
00:37:12,253 --> 00:37:13,840
Speaker 1: it's only going at SATA speed.

508
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:17,080
Speaker 1: You might as well just plugged it into the SATA port with the cable.

509
00:37:17,542 --> 00:37:21,597
Speaker 1: It's not really getting anything by being plugged directly into that m2 slot.

510
00:37:21,978 --> 00:37:24,044
Speaker 0: Yep So even even better.

511
00:37:24,565 --> 00:37:30,018
Speaker 0: so a lot of motherboards like they'll advertise like they'll even have multiple m.2 slots like yeah m.2 raid.

512
00:37:31,581 --> 00:37:36,120
Speaker 0: Usually if there's more than one it's because it's just say to using the m.2 form factor.

513
00:37:36,321 --> 00:37:40,359
Speaker 1: No, no, I seen drive motherboards where you can put in two real PCI.

514
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:43,593
Speaker 0: I have but but I've also seen a lot that pointedly we're not.

515
00:37:43,653 --> 00:37:44,015
Speaker 1: it's gonna be.

516
00:37:44,035 --> 00:37:45,140
Speaker 1: it's gonna be in the cheaper end.

517
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:51,385
Speaker 1: Right if you get a cheapo motherboard that looks like it has too many m2s for a cheap motherboard then Probably something's up with that.

518
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:52,229
Speaker 1: You got to read the specs.

519
00:37:52,290 --> 00:37:54,300
Speaker 1: Anyway, there's another thing going on.

520
00:37:54,380 --> 00:38:03,019
Speaker 1: It's tricky which is you plug in an m2 drive and even if it's in PCI Express mode It's linked up to some of the SATA ports.

521
00:38:03,463 --> 00:38:12,200
Speaker 1: So if you also have SATA drives Plugging in something into one of the m2 ports might disable some of the SATA ports that match up with that one.

522
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:20,438
Speaker 1: Yep, so it's like oh if I plug in something to m2 slot one SATA slots one and two become disabled and you can't plug anything into.

523
00:38:20,478 --> 00:38:20,800
Speaker 1: oh my god.

524
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:25,757
Speaker 0: I was about to make an analogy but then I realized that kids today probably wouldn't even know what this is.

525
00:38:25,777 --> 00:38:31,500
Speaker 0: but on Network gear in the older days you'd have a bunch of ports.

526
00:38:31,861 --> 00:38:36,700
Speaker 0: You can plug your stuff into like plug computer one computers you computer three, then you had on uplink port.

527
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:46,259
Speaker 0: That's where you plug the switch or the router or the hub Into your other switch or router or cable modem or whatever like the upstream stuff.

528
00:38:46,982 --> 00:38:49,150
Speaker 0: Usually there was one port.

529
00:38:49,411 --> 00:38:51,939
Speaker 0: like you'd have ports one two and three were like for plugging stuff in.

530
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:54,350
Speaker 0: Then you'd have port four and the uplink port.

531
00:38:54,691 --> 00:38:57,523
Speaker 0: if you plug something into the uplink port it Cannibalized.

532
00:38:57,584 --> 00:38:59,372
Speaker 0: port four is one or the other not both.

533
00:38:59,633 --> 00:38:59,874
Speaker 1: Yeah.

534
00:39:00,035 --> 00:39:02,285
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's like yeah You have to play it's.

535
00:39:02,426 --> 00:39:03,511
Speaker 1: it's a weird situation.

536
00:39:03,531 --> 00:39:05,440
Speaker 1: It's like you think well, I got ten plugs here, right?

537
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,460
Speaker 1: I can use all ten of them.

538
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:10,057
Speaker 1: It's like no actually if you use that one, it borrows bandwidth for that one.

539
00:39:10,177 --> 00:39:10,760
Speaker 1: You can't use it.

540
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:11,965
Speaker 1: You can't use both of these at once.

541
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:12,909
Speaker 1: Yeah one of the other.

542
00:39:13,090 --> 00:39:14,336
Speaker 0: so my motherboard supports both.

543
00:39:14,376 --> 00:39:20,340
Speaker 0: so I can tell it Hey, I'm gonna put us say to drive in this m2 and then there's one say to port that I just can't use.

544
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:21,404
Speaker 0: It's got a different color on it.

545
00:39:21,544 --> 00:39:28,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, or I can tell it that's an NVMe PCIe card and it says yes Sir, your Sata port is ready and available.

546
00:39:28,264 --> 00:39:29,322
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's you know you got it.

547
00:39:29,422 --> 00:39:36,429
Speaker 1: you got to make sure you know you're aware of this before you just start plugging stuff in because it'll tell you Like which ports become disabled and stuff like that, right?

548
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:36,850
Speaker 0: Now.

549
00:39:36,891 --> 00:39:41,879
Speaker 0: What's funny is I gotta remember how old I am because AHCI.

550
00:39:41,899 --> 00:39:50,126
Speaker 0: I Remember that being the new way to do things and then I just noticed I'm looking at the Wikipedia here in addition to supporting Legacy AHCI.

551
00:39:50,387 --> 00:39:51,972
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's NVMe now, right?

552
00:39:52,012 --> 00:39:52,955
Speaker 0: Yeah NVMe.

553
00:39:52,975 --> 00:40:03,017
Speaker 0: I forget what this stands for NVMe Express, okay Non-volatile memory host controller interface to NVM HCIS.

554
00:40:03,238 --> 00:40:06,446
Speaker 0: Yeah the To deal with all that shit.

555
00:40:06,908 --> 00:40:09,295
Speaker 0: This is kind of why this is really interesting.

556
00:40:09,496 --> 00:40:17,263
Speaker 0: Is that Sata and enable PETA like parallel like old IDE with the parallel channels like, you know the big ribbon cable?

557
00:40:17,845 --> 00:40:25,312
Speaker 0: it only had all those channels to try to push a lot of data as fast as possible and More wires was just better back in the old days.

558
00:40:25,392 --> 00:40:25,754
Speaker 0: nowadays.

559
00:40:25,874 --> 00:40:26,879
Speaker 0: One wire is usually better.

560
00:40:27,362 --> 00:40:35,260
Speaker 0: Serialized transactions can generally be scaled better anyway But hard drives could not execute parallel instructions.

561
00:40:36,043 --> 00:40:37,548
Speaker 0: Because there's a spinning platter.

562
00:40:37,568 --> 00:40:40,137
Speaker 1: the needle can read like one spot at a time.

563
00:40:40,318 --> 00:40:45,360
Speaker 0: Maybe Maybe they could be as long as the data was formed the right way.

564
00:40:45,761 --> 00:40:50,220
Speaker 0: They could be writing onto one side of one platter and reading onto part of another platter.

565
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,900
Speaker 1: I don't know that is the inside of a hard drive.

566
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:52,783
Speaker 0: That is not.

567
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:57,420
Speaker 0: even if that existed that is not something you could take advantage of or be scalable.

568
00:40:57,801 --> 00:41:24,027
Speaker 0: the reality was that hard drives could effectively just queue up operations, but couldn't have been parallel and early Sata SSDs Were pretty much the same way because even though they were a solid-state drive internally Which theoretically could be engineered to have parallel read and write operations you Wanted it to be compatible with the way hard drives plugged into computers So it just plugged into Sata.

569
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:26,959
Speaker 0: so even if the drive supported it your computer couldn't support that.

570
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:38,207
Speaker 0: as far as I can tell NVMe allows for the idea that you have a drive that could have parallel I/O and Take advantage of that right?

571
00:41:38,227 --> 00:41:42,905
Speaker 1: It's like you plug in a drive to Sata and it's like sure You know it you you can.

572
00:41:43,025 --> 00:41:47,760
Speaker 1: it can tell the computer that this is a solid-state drive and not a hard not a magnetic drive.

573
00:41:47,840 --> 00:41:51,193
Speaker 1: The computer the operating system can account for that to a certain extent.

574
00:41:51,274 --> 00:42:03,340
Speaker 1: right treat it slightly differently But it's still speaking the same state of protocol There's only so far it can go to treat it differently Right by plugging it into something different and being like this is definitely not a magnetic drive.

575
00:42:03,441 --> 00:42:05,734
Speaker 1: This is definitely solid-state storage.

576
00:42:05,935 --> 00:42:17,317
Speaker 1: with these capabilities You can take full advantage of those Capabilities and not using a protocol that was designed for a hard drive with a big spinning platter that you know Spun around with a motor yep.

577
00:42:18,242 --> 00:42:20,914
Speaker 0: So NVMe or NVM Express or you'll see.

578
00:42:21,095 --> 00:42:22,240
Speaker 0: people refer to different ways.

579
00:42:22,762 --> 00:42:26,476
Speaker 0: That's the thing if you buy like one of those Intel solid-state drives.

580
00:42:26,516 --> 00:42:28,081
Speaker 0: That's just a PCI card Mm-hmm.

581
00:42:28,402 --> 00:42:29,726
Speaker 0: well PCIe card yeah,

582
00:42:30,168 --> 00:42:43,280
Speaker 1: so another thing you might be confused about is when you're shopping for m2 drives You'll see all these numbers like 2280 and 22 something else and all these numbers like it's like what the hell are all these numbers And like the motherboard will list like four different numbers and the you know.

583
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:46,858
Speaker 1: But the drive will only have one number and of course common sense you just go.

584
00:42:47,019 --> 00:42:55,716
Speaker 1: okay I'll just make sure the number on the drive matches one of the compatible numbers in the motherboard and you're good to go which is true, but it's important to know what that number means.

585
00:42:55,776 --> 00:42:59,809
Speaker 1: that number is Literally just the size and shape of the m2 drive.

586
00:42:59,809 --> 00:43:02,096
Speaker 1: 22 is the width and the height.

587
00:43:02,256 --> 00:43:03,420
Speaker 1: the length of it is you know?

588
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:06,420
Speaker 0: The other number 80 every now and then the standard make sense.

589
00:43:06,620 --> 00:43:14,986
Speaker 1: I said 2280 is like those sort of is the normal size for most of them that you're gonna get these days like the Samsung 850s or whatever like the Evo's.

590
00:43:15,247 --> 00:43:16,371
Speaker 1: those are 2280.

591
00:43:16,371 --> 00:43:16,992
Speaker 1: I'm pretty sure.

592
00:43:17,153 --> 00:43:18,758
Speaker 1: now in the old days if you see one.

593
00:43:18,778 --> 00:43:22,066
Speaker 1: That's like 2240. well you know it's a short stubby one.

594
00:43:22,427 --> 00:43:29,940
Speaker 0: now in the old days with like ISA and PCI like the old things you'd plug into computers They didn't really have that much of a tight tolerance.

595
00:43:30,020 --> 00:43:32,972
Speaker 0: And how big the things like there were rules about how big things could actually be.

596
00:43:33,032 --> 00:43:35,622
Speaker 0: but like some video cards would just be Longer.

597
00:43:35,742 --> 00:43:40,657
Speaker 0: you just had to know and take it into account and the tolerances weren't that big as computer cases were big.

598
00:43:40,998 --> 00:43:46,936
Speaker 0: the whole point Of m2 is to be able to build very space efficient computers.

599
00:43:47,378 --> 00:43:57,294
Speaker 0: so the Specifications and the way you refer to these things encoded those sizes Directly like this because people care a lot about how many millimeters wide something.

600
00:43:57,315 --> 00:43:58,479
Speaker 1: well you'll see on the motherboard.

601
00:43:58,579 --> 00:44:02,133
Speaker 1: usually They'll be the m2 connector and then one screw and then another screw.

602
00:44:02,214 --> 00:44:04,193
Speaker 1: so if it allows for the longer one Yeah, right.

603
00:44:04,521 --> 00:44:08,157
Speaker 1: And that's that you you're only gonna put one screw in there and the way you install it is real simple.

604
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:19,777
Speaker 1: you put in The end with the clips into the into the slot you push it down and get flat against the motherboard Top or some of them go on the bottom of the motherboard Yeah, which is cool, and then you put in the one screw, and you're good to go.

605
00:44:19,837 --> 00:44:20,159
Speaker 1: It's great.

606
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:24,634
Speaker 0: No, I can slide one into my nose up there if I was separate power connectors.

607
00:44:24,695 --> 00:44:25,537
Speaker 1: No nothing okay.

608
00:44:25,578 --> 00:44:29,237
Speaker 1: now one more thing You got to know is like this is a B business.

609
00:44:29,358 --> 00:44:38,520
Speaker 0: luckily This doesn't like you don't have to worry about it as much because it's kind of like in the old days with AGP Like whether or not you had the tab for the voltages and everything.

610
00:44:39,402 --> 00:44:42,862
Speaker 1: You don't to worry about this too much, but it's also good to know yeah Is that so?

611
00:44:43,063 --> 00:44:47,859
Speaker 1: on the connector part is a little notch and some have the notch on the left B?

612
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:59,765
Speaker 1: Some have the notch on the right them some have the both not just being M. Yep, so you'll see a drive will be like B. Plus M. That means that on the connector part It's got two notches on it.

613
00:45:00,247 --> 00:45:02,615
Speaker 1: You just got to make sure it fits in your mother part.

614
00:45:02,735 --> 00:45:03,658
Speaker 1: It's probably gonna fit.

615
00:45:03,879 --> 00:45:05,023
Speaker 0: yep I'm pretty sure.

616
00:45:05,223 --> 00:45:17,016
Speaker 1: pretty much all the motherboards have B, and if you buy a modern motherboard from you know aces a asrock Gigabyte whoever right and you buy a Samsung Evo m2 is gonna fit.

617
00:45:17,517 --> 00:45:18,280
Speaker 1: it's gonna be just fine.

618
00:45:18,743 --> 00:45:20,860
Speaker 0: It's sort of interesting that this is the kind of thing where?

619
00:45:22,001 --> 00:45:30,996
Speaker 0: It matters for early adopters because there would be things that only supported certain kinds of yes Like when m2 is brand new everyone is still feeling it out.

620
00:45:31,056 --> 00:45:31,880
Speaker 1: get a little bit now.

621
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:41,059
Speaker 0: It's standardized you're good to go like AGP there was still there within the old days you could buy video cards that were AGP and try to plug them in your AGP core port and they just wouldn't fit.

622
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:47,176
Speaker 0: and the assumption was the only people buying AGP video cards in that era were people who knew what they were doing.

623
00:45:47,617 --> 00:45:57,422
Speaker 0: and then later the GP ports just supported every kind of AGP card mm-hmm, so I hope we demystified the deal with m2 Cuz.

624
00:45:57,744 --> 00:45:59,780
Speaker 1: frankly it took me a while to figure it out.

625
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:03,034
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you have those numbers somewhat recently.

626
00:46:03,074 --> 00:46:13,760
Speaker 1: so if you have an existing computer You're just gonna buy a SATA hard drive or SSD or whatever and stick it in there still making new SSDs that are SATA, and they're still just great and still just fine and still crazy fast.

627
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:19,920
Speaker 1: There's nothing wrong with those, but if you're building new computers Pretty much if you're gonna cost you a bit more to get an m2 drive.

628
00:46:20,041 --> 00:46:24,609
Speaker 1: So if you can't if you want to save money That's the first place to save money is to get the SSD.

629
00:46:24,890 --> 00:46:32,620
Speaker 1: that's goes SATA instead of m2 because for most Normal people doing normal stuff that difference you won't know your game is gonna load a little slow or whatever.

630
00:46:32,620 --> 00:46:33,647
Speaker 0: But I predict it'll.

631
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:35,520
Speaker 1: the SSDs are still crazy fast.

632
00:46:35,600 --> 00:46:37,997
Speaker 1: You could save like a hundred to two hundred dollars, but not going m2.

633
00:46:38,681 --> 00:46:43,759
Speaker 0: Oh my HDPC probably got four more years of life just by replacing its old spinning disk with a regular old SSD.

634
00:46:44,241 --> 00:46:44,562
Speaker 1: That is.

635
00:46:44,683 --> 00:46:48,260
Speaker 1: one of the good thing about SATA is that you had your spinning disks hooked up to SATA.

636
00:46:48,300 --> 00:46:50,079
Speaker 1: now You can get an SSD play in the same hole.

637
00:46:50,702 --> 00:46:57,030
Speaker 0: But I think it won't be long until the vast majority of computers if you buy or build one Even if it's still SATA you're gonna put.

638
00:46:57,091 --> 00:46:58,618
Speaker 0: you're gonna have one hard drive is gonna be an m.2.

639
00:46:59,223 --> 00:47:02,065
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you have two hard drives It's just gonna be two m.2s.

640
00:47:02,426 --> 00:47:07,624
Speaker 1: and then the only other kinds of the main limitation is that the biggest m2s are like one Terabyte.

641
00:47:07,665 --> 00:47:12,390
Speaker 1: I think I've seen some two terabyte ones But they cost on our as much as the whole computer.

642
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:15,461
Speaker 1: like mine a one terabyte m2 is like $1,000.

643
00:47:15,461 --> 00:47:16,094
Speaker 1: It's like fuck.

644
00:47:16,155 --> 00:47:18,428
Speaker 1: no I have a 512 is like it.

645
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:25,784
Speaker 1: the for the is the price for people who have money and the 256 is for the price of people who have More less money.

646
00:47:25,804 --> 00:47:31,590
Speaker 0: Yep, but that's fine because if you need more space just add SSD That's much cheaper.

647
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:34,448
Speaker 0: or add a magnetic drive Even if you need a lot of space.

648
00:47:34,468 --> 00:47:35,432
Speaker 1: if you just got like thing about.

649
00:47:35,452 --> 00:47:38,549
Speaker 1: if you got a computer and it's like, okay I'll install windows in the m2.

650
00:47:38,931 --> 00:47:40,863
Speaker 1: I'll install the gate the Applications.

651
00:47:40,903 --> 00:47:42,269
Speaker 1: I use the most on the m2s.

652
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:47,660
Speaker 0: they load real fast on the games my Adobe apps Whatever my other crap on just a cheap SSD that I played into it.

653
00:47:47,841 --> 00:47:52,686
Speaker 1: But if you got all this stuff you could put it on an SSD and if you even want to save more money It's like okay.

654
00:47:52,726 --> 00:47:54,280
Speaker 1: I got a huge video collection.

655
00:47:54,421 --> 00:47:56,932
Speaker 1: You could put that on a magnetic drive and you wouldn't notice for shit.

656
00:47:57,234 --> 00:47:58,540
Speaker 0: now the fun thing about magnetic drives.

657
00:47:58,861 --> 00:47:59,524
Speaker 0: It's so cheap.

658
00:47:59,765 --> 00:48:01,633
Speaker 1: You can get as well as massive.

659
00:48:01,653 --> 00:48:08,808
Speaker 0: one might as well just buy two and raid them Like why not get an eight terabyte if you got money, but yeah You just get it by one if you don't have more.

660
00:48:08,828 --> 00:48:12,480
Speaker 0: thereby four terabyte spinning discs ain't expensive?

661
00:48:12,801 --> 00:48:13,504
Speaker 1: No, it's not.

662
00:48:13,584 --> 00:48:19,545
Speaker 1: you can get a four terabyte like spinning magnetic disc for like less than a hundred bucks Probably way less than that.

663
00:48:19,666 --> 00:48:26,280
Speaker 1: and meanwhile, you know a one term, you know to get four terabytes of m2 Storage is gonna cost you like five thousand.

664
00:48:27,601 --> 00:48:28,283
Speaker 1: Right, you could.

665
00:48:28,725 --> 00:48:30,530
Speaker 1: it's ridiculous the difference in price.

666
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:33,800
Speaker 1: So yeah, the magnetic drive is not dead yet, right?

667
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:40,729
Speaker 0: That's why you still the magnetic drive is the place is for if you have Terabytes of data that you want to start.

668
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:44,240
Speaker 1: people are not storing so much anymore because they use their streaming their music.

669
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:51,220
Speaker 1: They're streaming their videos and most you know, yeah, maybe you got a photo collection You keep in the cloud on Google Photos and then you know stuff like that.

670
00:48:51,260 --> 00:48:51,503
Speaker 1: It's like.

671
00:48:51,544 --> 00:49:03,599
Speaker 1: well now you're not storing anything But people who are still storing things people are storing photos locally people who are have videos downloaded or making videos usually creators Are gonna be stored right or you know anything like that?

672
00:49:03,860 --> 00:49:10,524
Speaker 1: Yeah, you might need to throw a magnet drive in there to get your storage up or just a NAS but that's still a magnet Drive is just in a different box.

673
00:49:10,605 --> 00:49:11,989
Speaker 1: Yeah the box your computers in.

674
00:49:12,712 --> 00:49:17,870
Speaker 0: so if you're building a computer in the near future You're probably have one hard drive for all your basic stuff.

675
00:49:17,891 --> 00:49:18,975
Speaker 1: now, you know how the m2 goes.

676
00:49:19,015 --> 00:49:19,718
Speaker 0: Yeah, it'll be an m.2.

677
00:49:25,794 --> 00:49:28,330
Speaker 0: This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.
