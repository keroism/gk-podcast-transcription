1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:09,449
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday, March 1st, 2022.

2
00:00:09,449 --> 00:00:09,590
Speaker 0: I'm Rym.

3
00:00:12,808 --> 00:00:13,197
Speaker 1: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,685
Speaker 0: And this is Geek Nights.

5
00:00:14,705 --> 00:00:18,000
Speaker 0: Tonight we are talking about Offworld Trading Company.

6
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:21,780
Speaker 0: A Stardock game from 2016.

7
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:22,737
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

8
00:00:24,642 --> 00:00:26,679
Speaker 1: Oh, we got a sudden, a sudden news.

9
00:00:27,603 --> 00:00:27,856
Speaker 1: Uh oh.

10
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:33,220
Speaker 1: They, uh, they signed the Bender guy for the Futurama show so that the Bendergate is over.

11
00:00:33,481 --> 00:00:34,468
Speaker 0: Pikachu face.

12
00:00:34,629 --> 00:00:36,060
Speaker 0: Like, I didn't expect that to happen.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:40,780
Speaker 0: It was really clear that there were, like, ongoing negotiations that were not public as part of that conversation.

14
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:46,479
Speaker 1: He's just trying to get paid and he deserves it because, uh, you know, people wouldn't be...

15
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:50,200
Speaker 0: He's the voice of, it was, he's the voice of Jake and Bender.

16
00:00:52,282 --> 00:00:58,200
Speaker 0: And he did it so well that when I saw Futurama, I thought, that is the voice of Bender and nothing could ever change that for the rest of my life.

17
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:05,319
Speaker 0: And then I saw Adventure Time and for half of the first episode, I thought, that's just Jake's voice, or that's just Bender's voice.

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,780
Speaker 0: And then it became Jake's voice permanently, instantly, and it was over.

19
00:01:09,582 --> 00:01:11,858
Speaker 1: He's got a really good voice, uh, you know.

20
00:01:13,901 --> 00:01:14,320
Speaker 0: Just talking.

21
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:21,740
Speaker 0: Brad, I was worried as soon as you said, uh oh, breaking news because most breaking news in the last five days has not been great news.

22
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:25,059
Speaker 1: That news is not for the shows, you know, that's for other things.

23
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:25,521
Speaker 0: Yup.

24
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:38,900
Speaker 0: So, uh, of course, we're not gonna cover it as news on Geek Nights, especially not today on a Tuesday, because you should not be coming to us for news about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

25
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:45,239
Speaker 0: This is uncharted territory, this is the largest land war in Europe since World War II.

26
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,700
Speaker 1: I mean, there have been instances of invasions, uh, during, well, Geek Nights existed.

27
00:01:52,641 --> 00:02:04,100
Speaker 0: But never on this scale, with this level of escalation, it basically, within 24 hours of it starting, which was, weirdly, I remember we finished the bell show.

28
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:12,040
Speaker 1: It was, yeah, all the previous invasions, at least, I mean, there were other ones, but, you know, the ones that make the news in the United States, at least, right?

29
00:02:12,901 --> 00:02:19,380
Speaker 1: So, uh, were always us, uh, just, you know, being imperialist and invading people for oil or other nonsense reasons.

30
00:02:20,341 --> 00:02:25,820
Speaker 0: Yup, I mean, uh, we, as a nation, invaded Iraq for literally no reason, not that long ago.

31
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:32,160
Speaker 1: That's pretty much, you know, most of the wars that I've experienced in my life were of that variety.

32
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:40,760
Speaker 0: But, uh, I think what's interesting, and then we'll move on, because, again, go to experts to read about this, like, it is moving very rapidly.

33
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:45,439
Speaker 0: Anything that you hear us even say is probably out of date by the time you listen to this.

34
00:02:46,361 --> 00:02:52,500
Speaker 0: Uh, but I guess it is very interesting to me that, one- Imagine how out of date they were in the newsreel times, right?

35
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,720
Speaker 1: Watching Newsreel, it's like something that happened a month ago.

36
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:05,119
Speaker 0: It's such a, it's a weird disconnect, like, you know, I was at work and, you know, I had a meeting and, uh, someone, like, the call starts, and someone just says, "Is there any news from the

37
00:03:05,179 --> 00:03:05,400
Speaker 0: front?".

38
00:03:06,441 --> 00:03:15,762
Speaker 0: And that was a perfectly legitimate question that I did not expect to hear in my daily life, like, with a person I was talking to in the year 2022.

39
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:17,999
Speaker 1: I think only an old person would phrase it that way, though.

40
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:20,253
Speaker 0: Uh, this was an older person, but not that old.

41
00:03:20,675 --> 00:03:21,259
Speaker 0: Not that old.

42
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:43,760
Speaker 0: But, uh, I guess it's interesting that the CIA and the UK, all the intelligence organizations of the world kind of leaked what the plan was, and it seems like the intent was to leak Russia's plan so that maybe Russia would change their plan, or not go forward with this.

43
00:03:44,261 --> 00:03:54,360
Speaker 0: And instead, Russia seems to be, as a military power, following the plan that was leaked, regardless of the fact that half the things that were part of that plan didn't pan out.

44
00:03:55,561 --> 00:03:57,565
Speaker 0: And it's a real weird situation right now.

45
00:03:57,605 --> 00:04:04,300
Speaker 0: that's beyond what even most, like, geopolitical scholars expected as a worst-case scenario.

46
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:09,358
Speaker 1: Alright, well, I mean, you know, if you just do what's expected, that's it, right?

47
00:04:11,081 --> 00:04:14,648
Speaker 0: But, uh, yeah, just pay attention to it.

48
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:20,459
Speaker 0: I've tweeted at length about the fact that there is not actually a risk of a real nuclear war.

49
00:04:21,402 --> 00:04:22,280
Speaker 1: That seems unlikely.

50
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:33,300
Speaker 0: It is extremely unlikely, but the thing I really want to point out, and I'm repeating this everywhere I have any amount of following, is that you're going to keep seeing the news talking about nuclear weapons and nuclear war.

51
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:35,389
Speaker 1: The news loves to talk about anything.

52
00:04:35,429 --> 00:04:37,740
Speaker 1: that's, you know, not going to make you scared.

53
00:04:40,241 --> 00:04:43,989
Speaker 1: You're telling me that the same news is like, "It's 11, where's the fuck are your children?

54
00:04:44,069 --> 00:04:49,440
Speaker 1: Oh my god, you're going to go outside, there's going to be a person out there who's not white, they're going to kill you, stay

55
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:49,600
Speaker 1: inside.".

56
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:54,319
Speaker 1: It's like, you're telling me that news is stoking fears about nuclear war?

57
00:04:54,963 --> 00:04:56,260
Speaker 1: That same news, really?

58
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,779
Speaker 0: This news that I've been using for these years, these clamps.

59
00:05:00,921 --> 00:05:09,020
Speaker 0: But I guess what I'll say is this, with nuclear weapons in particular, experts tend to use a lot of jargon when they talk about them.

60
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:25,160
Speaker 0: So, actually, for real, innocuous news that happens to involve strategic, which is, you know, another jargon term for nuclear weapons, will make them sound far scarier or more dangerous than they actually are if you're uninformed.

61
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,620
Speaker 1: So my advice to you- Not helping them yet, the same problem has a nuclear power.

62
00:05:28,821 --> 00:05:29,445
Speaker 0: Exactly.

63
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:31,580
Speaker 0: Or even things like thermobaric weapons.

64
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:36,220
Speaker 0: Like, I'm not saying thermobaric weapons are a humane thing to be used.

65
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:39,080
Speaker 0: Like, do not think that I'm defending thermobaric weapons.

66
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:46,280
Speaker 0: But thermobaric weapons are not materially beyond what non-thermobaric weapons are.

67
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:54,880
Speaker 0: Like, the media will use these terms, but if you are not an expert, it is easy to get a lot more scared than you should be about things.

68
00:05:55,161 --> 00:06:01,340
Speaker 0: And if you think, "Oh, I'll go follow experts," they know what's up, they're going to use jargon that's going to confuse and scare you even more.

69
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:11,540
Speaker 0: So my advice is, one, if you're actually afraid of nuclear war, do not seek out the opinion of experts on nuclear war, because they're going to say things that are going to scare you for no reason.

70
00:06:12,161 --> 00:06:16,620
Speaker 1: And two- Yeah, like the people with their doomsday clock that's at, like, one second away from midnight or whatever.

71
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,800
Speaker 0: Well, actually, the doomsday clock has made it very clear.

72
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:21,720
Speaker 0: The nuclear threat is not why the clock is where it is.

73
00:06:21,821 --> 00:06:23,439
Speaker 0: It is solely because of climate change.

74
00:06:24,136 --> 00:06:24,259
Speaker 1: No.

75
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:39,560
Speaker 0: Two, if you see news about nuclear anything, right now and for the foreseeable future, and you don't understand that news, do not retweet it or share it with other people or paraphrase it.

76
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,519
Speaker 0: Let other people do that.

77
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,919
Speaker 0: Because if you don't understand it, what are the odds that the people you share it to are going to understand it?

78
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:55,200
Speaker 0: And a lot of the talking parts about nuclear weapons are extremely scary if you do not have a lot of weird knowledge that most people do not have and should not seek out, frankly.

79
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:01,300
Speaker 1: The only nuclear weapon news you need to worry about is nukes coming at you right now.

80
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,740
Speaker 1: And if that happens, which is extremely unlikely, again, it's, like, not going to happen.

81
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:13,140
Speaker 1: If it does, your phone will let you the fuck know, the same way it lets you know when there's a hurricane or anything else.

82
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:31,680
Speaker 0: Yep, and the only, like, the only thing that could happen in the news, short of a nuke going off, which, again, the odds are basically zero, like, for real, would be if NATO became directly involved with Russian forces, that is the thing that would change that conversation at all.

83
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:46,380
Speaker 0: So anything that happens that does not include NATO actually, for real, fighting directly with Russian forces, then any news you see about nuclear weapons does not represent any material change in the situation related to nuclear weapons.

84
00:07:47,202 --> 00:07:48,579
Speaker 0: That's hard to internalize.

85
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:52,900
Speaker 1: You're really helping this by, you know, mentioning the nuclear weapons, right?

86
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,040
Speaker 1: You're sort of getting an old Streisand effect, right?

87
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:55,222
Speaker 1: No,

88
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,313
Speaker 0: you guys, it's a little, there's

89
00:07:56,353 --> 00:07:56,919
Speaker 1: a little bit of-

90
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:12,780
Speaker 0: No, 'cause there's a little zebra storyteller of, you gotta almost inoculate yourself against if the news starts talking a big stupid game about it, to remember that unless one of these big things changed, the news is just talking about scarce stuff, it's not actually a material change.

91
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:16,300
Speaker 1: Is the zebra storyteller the antidote for the Streisand effect or not?

92
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:30,800
Speaker 0: It may or may not be, I don't know, but, uh, for real, this is a major ongoing conflict with minute-to-minute updates, and I guess the last thing I'll say is, you do not need to follow this second-by-second.

93
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,179
Speaker 0: That does not help your psyche, 'cause you're not gonna, you're not gonna make any different decisions in your life.

94
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:43,139
Speaker 1: If you're listening to this podcast, it's unlikely that you're in a position to do anything material to help in a significant way, right?

95
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:55,200
Speaker 1: The only way you can help, you know, as a normal person who is listening to Geek Nights is through collective action, and, uh, you know, contributing your part to a greater whole that might do something.

96
00:08:56,581 --> 00:09:02,740
Speaker 1: So, if you want to do something, seek out such a collective action, otherwise, there's nothing you can do.

97
00:09:03,581 --> 00:09:08,460
Speaker 0: So yeah, uh, enough said about that, we're gonna move into the regular old Geek Nights from this point.

98
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:13,940
Speaker 0: And, uh, we'll start with, there was big gaming news that dropped kinda out of nowhere.

99
00:09:14,801 --> 00:09:27,100
Speaker 1: Uh, Pokemon, Scarlet, and Violet were announced, there was actually a real- It's surprising, 'cause it doesn't feel like the previous two main, you know, we're talking main Pokemon games, not side deals, right?

100
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,959
Speaker 1: The Sword and Shield ones don't feel like they're that old, and we've already got another one coming up right in.

101
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,220
Speaker 1: It's like, is this, I have to, I didn't look and see, but is this a normal time gap between main Pokemon games?

102
00:09:40,441 --> 00:09:43,160
Speaker 1: Or is it, or was it really shorter like it feels?

103
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:49,618
Speaker 0: I mean, I haven't beaten a Pokemon game since Pearl, so I'm not really one to talk about.

104
00:09:50,220 --> 00:10:00,855
Speaker 1: I do have to say, right, I beat Pokemon Red and Silver on cartridges back in the day, and I caught all the Pokemon, all of them, right?

105
00:10:00,996 --> 00:10:01,879
Speaker 1: Every single one.

106
00:10:03,241 --> 00:10:06,460
Speaker 0: Sure, Grandpa, no one can catch all the Pokemon now.

107
00:10:06,881 --> 00:10:07,298
Speaker 1: That's right.

108
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:12,478
Speaker 1: After that, I think I skipped the Ruby, whatever it was, I don't know.

109
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:25,460
Speaker 1: But basically, since then, I have bought a lot of, not side Pokemon, I've only bought a few side Pokemon games, but I bought a lot of the main Pokemon games, and I would get a few Gyms in and never beat them.

110
00:10:25,820 --> 00:10:32,139
Speaker 1: So, even though a lot of those games were great, and I had no complaints about them whatsoever, I just didn't end up beating them.

111
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,600
Speaker 1: I didn't have the time for it, or they didn't keep my interest.

112
00:10:36,282 --> 00:10:42,839
Speaker 1: It's like I would play and play and play, and it would keep my interest, but then as soon as I saved and put it away, I'd forget about it, and I wouldn't go back to it.

113
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,080
Speaker 1: So, I've learned my lesson, and I'm going to save myself.

114
00:10:47,304 --> 00:10:48,919
Speaker 1: I bought the Shield or Sword one.

115
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,547
Speaker 0: Which were from 2019, so it's been a while.

116
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:53,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, it has been a while.

117
00:10:55,323 --> 00:10:58,880
Speaker 1: I got a few Gyms in, and then I stopped playing, and I could go back to it, I guess.

118
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:00,440
Speaker 0: So, I guess, what's noteworthy?

119
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:05,900
Speaker 1: I learned my lesson, and even though this one, the new one, that Duck starter looks pretty good.

120
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,519
Speaker 1: I like a duck.

121
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,960
Speaker 0: Oh, that duck is the best one.

122
00:11:08,061 --> 00:11:09,079
Speaker 0: That's actually the one I would pick.

123
00:11:10,101 --> 00:11:14,440
Speaker 0: I almost always have gone with whatever the Grass starter is, and I would make an exception.

124
00:11:14,581 --> 00:11:24,740
Speaker 1: I mean, I would normally pick Grass because Green, and Grass is Green, but sometimes the Grass Pokemon, I just go with the coolest one or the cutest one.

125
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,394
Speaker 1: I can't be going based on any other type business, right?

126
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:40,660
Speaker 1: But anyway, if I hadn't learned my lesson, I would buy this and pick the duck, but I just learned my lesson, I'm not going to buy it, because I know that I'm just going to play a few Gyms and then stop.

127
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:45,900
Speaker 0: So, I guess what's notable, it's open world, like that seems to be the evolution of mainline Pokemon games.

128
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:49,240
Speaker 1: The new one, the Sword Shield one kind of is also a little bit.

129
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:55,880
Speaker 0: Yep, but continuing with that, the open world, that aspect of Pokemon seems like it's going to be a long-standing thing now.

130
00:11:57,022 --> 00:12:02,920
Speaker 0: Two, the puns and the names are Spanish-derived more so than English-derived.

131
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:18,639
Speaker 1: Well, because every Pokemon game has a region that it takes place in, and that region is often a sort of imitation that is inspired by a real world location, like the Alola Pokemon was a Hawaiian one, right?

132
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:26,300
Speaker 0: And I've seen Hispanic and Spanish-speaking and Spanish-adjacent gamers being very excited about this all over Twitter.

133
00:12:26,841 --> 00:12:31,040
Speaker 1: The new one they just announced is basically, yeah, it's Spain, it's Pokemon in Spain.

134
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:38,040
Speaker 1: There's going to be bull Pokemon, probably, that are going to run, they're going full Spain.

135
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:41,339
Speaker 1: So, we don't know much more.

136
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:42,859
Speaker 1: Hopefully, without the Inquisition part.

137
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:54,580
Speaker 0: So, for all the news, all we actually have to go on are a handful of statements, the images from the trailer, which is mostly a live-action skit that really buried the lead.

138
00:12:55,221 --> 00:13:04,040
Speaker 0: Like, if you saw this trailer and didn't know it was the Pokemon trailer for two new mainline Pokemon games, you would not be sure what they were announcing until halfway through the trailer.

139
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:25,914
Speaker 1: Not to talk about the war again, but it was confirmed by Nintendo, I believe, that they intentionally didn't do their full, they decreased the volume on the marketing because they weren't going to change their announcement date, but they decreased the volume on the marketing and instead of being like, "Holy crap, guys, Pokemon

140
00:13:25,934 --> 00:13:26,197
Speaker 1: Direct!"

141
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:29,356
Speaker 1: They were just like, "Alright, Pokemon Direct, it's happening, here it

142
00:13:29,456 --> 00:13:29,537
Speaker 1: is.".

143
00:13:30,281 --> 00:13:38,493
Speaker 1: Because there was an invasion going on and they don't want to be like, "Oh, yes, people are being murdered by an invading army.

144
00:13:38,653 --> 00:13:39,496
Speaker 1: Hey, come play

145
00:13:39,516 --> 00:13:39,978
Speaker 1: Pokemon!".

146
00:13:40,761 --> 00:13:46,140
Speaker 0: Like, when I talk, look at me on social media, a lot less just shitposting than usual.

147
00:13:47,161 --> 00:13:51,680
Speaker 0: I feel like a lot of people are dialing down the volume on anything they're doing with good cause.

148
00:13:55,162 --> 00:14:02,760
Speaker 0: In some other news, the playdate continues to slowly gain adoption and interest.

149
00:14:03,761 --> 00:14:08,824
Speaker 1: We talked about the playdate a few times, the new handheld that's black and white and has a little crank on the side.

150
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:14,780
Speaker 1: that was crowdfunded and then it's been delayed a few times.

151
00:14:15,101 --> 00:14:21,339
Speaker 1: and they released a little tool on their website that lets you make games, but it's a really simple tool that can only make simple games.

152
00:14:22,201 --> 00:14:28,687
Speaker 1: We've been waiting for the real SDK that would let you make whatever the hell software you wanted and that was released yesterday.

153
00:14:28,787 --> 00:14:36,900
Speaker 1: and I tested it out and made a little "Hello World" video game equivalent where you load a background, you load a sprite and you can move the sprite around with a d-pad.

154
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:41,280
Speaker 1: and that took me longer to set up the dev environment than to write the program.

155
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,724
Speaker 1: It took five minutes, right?

156
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:46,919
Speaker 1: I just squiggled two PNG files in Photoshop and that was good to go.

157
00:14:47,622 --> 00:14:53,640
Speaker 1: So, yeah, this thing is, you know, the next step they say is they're actually going to deliver them.

158
00:14:53,840 --> 00:15:00,739
Speaker 1: I pre-ordered one so I'm going to get one and I'm working on, you know, I guess shit-talking about making a game for it.

159
00:15:02,181 --> 00:15:08,260
Speaker 1: I can't promise actually making a game for it unless you count my little "Hello World" as a game.

160
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,300
Speaker 0: It's a fun, what I like about it the most is that this feels a lot like something we've talked about on GeekKnights before.

161
00:15:14,801 --> 00:15:34,660
Speaker 0: It's the equivalent of a graphing calculator in that it's the kind of device that's accessible enough to a designer or a coder to mess with, homebrew, and like learn basic principles to make something that'll work out of hardware that it's going to be a fantastic tool for hobbyists, for schools, for game design programs.

162
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:39,720
Speaker 0: There's a lot of ways you can use this kind of device and I think it's really exciting.

163
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:55,860
Speaker 1: You know, you've had a lot of these sort of fantasy consoles like the Pico 8 and whatnot where, you know, they create a video game console that never existed, just an imagined one and then they create an emulator for it and then you make games for it, but there are PC games, right?

164
00:15:56,963 --> 00:15:59,011
Speaker 1: You can't really run them on anything else too much.

165
00:15:59,914 --> 00:16:01,379
Speaker 1: Some things you can, but not, you know.

166
00:16:03,204 --> 00:16:05,140
Speaker 1: But here, it's like they took it to the next level.

167
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:14,073
Speaker 1: You know, programming for the play date is not really dissimilar from programming for the Pico 8 or any other similar simple fantasy console only.

168
00:16:14,093 --> 00:16:16,000
Speaker 1: It's a real console, right?

169
00:16:16,581 --> 00:16:24,505
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, it's a real physical thing that you're going to arrive at some point relatively soon and that's kind of cool.

170
00:16:24,565 --> 00:16:30,926
Speaker 1: We haven't had, I mean, there are people who can make a Game Boy game and make an NES game, right?

171
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:39,017
Speaker 1: But programming for those platforms is either really difficult because you've got to do assembly or C or whatever.

172
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:50,040
Speaker 1: there's not really advanced development tools or you use something like NES Maker which is pretty advanced actually, but it's a lot like using Game Maker, RPG Maker, right?

173
00:16:50,801 --> 00:16:53,691
Speaker 1: This is an actual console.

174
00:16:54,153 --> 00:16:56,260
Speaker 1: that's, you know, for the people, right?

175
00:16:56,380 --> 00:17:02,920
Speaker 1: But it's open and you can really make stuff for it, like 100%, just write a program in C and run it on there.

176
00:17:04,325 --> 00:17:04,977
Speaker 1: It's pretty great.

177
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,693
Speaker 0: Alright, we can get into the main bit.

178
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:16,858
Speaker 0: There's a thing about Switch 2 trending again because of an Nvidia leak but that's all like unconfirmed nonsense, so I'm not going to cover it.

179
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:17,742
Speaker 1: That's nonsense.

180
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,179
Speaker 1: Also, when is Nintendo included Nvidia hardware in their console?

181
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:21,921
Speaker 0: Exactly.

182
00:17:23,345 --> 00:17:28,138
Speaker 0: Either this is radically misinterpreted or there's even bigger news that isn't confirmed yet.

183
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,540
Speaker 1: But yeah, Nvidia did get some leakage.

184
00:17:33,341 --> 00:17:34,487
Speaker 0: But I'll cover that later.

185
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,180
Speaker 0: I see a lot of conflicting discussion.

186
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:44,618
Speaker 1: You can't trust news about leakages unless, you know, it has to be like that Nintendo one where they had all those assets and stuff, right?

187
00:17:46,383 --> 00:17:48,039
Speaker 1: Most leakage news you can't trust.

188
00:17:49,422 --> 00:17:52,260
Speaker 0: But anyway, things of the day.

189
00:17:52,420 --> 00:17:53,084
Speaker 0: So check this out.

190
00:17:53,326 --> 00:17:54,312
Speaker 0: I ski.

191
00:17:54,533 --> 00:17:55,660
Speaker 0: It's one of my main hobbies.

192
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,813
Speaker 0: And sometimes when you ski, you fall.

193
00:17:59,316 --> 00:17:59,980
Speaker 0: You fall over.

194
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,818
Speaker 0: Good reason not to ski.

195
00:18:02,661 --> 00:18:04,390
Speaker 0: Sometimes when you're on a bike, you fall over.

196
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:06,159
Speaker 0: Sometimes when you're just walking, you fall over.

197
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:20,880
Speaker 0: What I like about skiing is that if I say, bounce off of a tree, do a 360 vertically and land somewhere, and I'm on a bike, I'm usually bleeding from a couple of places and have like a busted rib or something.

198
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:22,539
Speaker 0: But when that happens...

199
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,199
Speaker 1: Because if that happens on a bike, you're probably landing on the hard ground, right?

200
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:31,779
Speaker 0: The bike might land on top of you, which has happened to me before.

201
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:39,257
Speaker 0: But skiing, if you fall over, you usually just fall into a bunch of snow.

202
00:18:42,062 --> 00:18:47,220
Speaker 0: I fall down all the time skiing, and I almost never have even minor injuries from that compared to mountain biking.

203
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:55,660
Speaker 0: But once, I was skiing on a trail called Bunny Buster, this really easy blue at Killington, but it was icy, shitty weather.

204
00:18:56,221 --> 00:18:59,720
Speaker 0: And I fell near the top of the trail, and I slid all the way down.

205
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:00,945
Speaker 0: I couldn't stop myself.

206
00:19:01,005 --> 00:19:03,540
Speaker 0: I slid all the way down on ice to the bottom of the mountain.

207
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:06,858
Speaker 1: Couldn't you just like, you have the ski poles, can't you just stick them in the ground?

208
00:19:07,763 --> 00:19:10,640
Speaker 0: In this case, the ski, the ground was basically solid ice.

209
00:19:11,402 --> 00:19:13,520
Speaker 0: It was a terrible day for skiing, I really shouldn't have even been there.

210
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:19,359
Speaker 1: You couldn't just like scrape the ice, you had nothing pointy or whatever to like just create any amount of friction with the ice.

211
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,000
Speaker 0: So I was able to slow myself down.

212
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:27,217
Speaker 0: I didn't actually make it to the end end of the trail, I slid like always, and very slowly came to a stop.

213
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,199
Speaker 0: And then luckily someone like kicked my skis down to me.

214
00:19:32,043 --> 00:19:45,739
Speaker 0: So this is a video of someone skiing and on a really easy looking black diamond, like just a long, wide, straight piste, but the snow doesn't look great, and they fell like I did that one time on the ice.

215
00:19:46,547 --> 00:19:53,240
Speaker 0: And they start sliding, but they keep sliding, and keep sliding faster and faster and faster.

216
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:59,999
Speaker 0: They slid on their ass over a kilometer before they eventually crashed into a net.

217
00:20:01,603 --> 00:20:04,479
Speaker 0: They're totally fine, they get up, and they're like "ugh" at the end.

218
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,720
Speaker 0: They had a GoPro on, you get to see the whole thing in glorious detail.

219
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:20,380
Speaker 1: And to answer your earlier question, I feel like no matter how much of a ski device it is, I feel like with a whole kilometer of time, you've got to be something you can do to create some friction and at least stop.

220
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:29,359
Speaker 0: So yes, there is a technique called the self-arrest that if you ski in those kinds of conditions, you are supposed to learn.

221
00:20:30,221 --> 00:20:33,660
Speaker 0: And this person clearly did not know how to do this at all.

222
00:20:34,121 --> 00:20:42,499
Speaker 0: It's one thing to slide down like a small blue trail somewhere on a mountain like in the east coast, but sliding a whole kilometer, this is like a case study in.

223
00:20:43,185 --> 00:20:49,560
Speaker 0: you should have learned this basic technique, you got way too far into your learnings, missing something fundamental.

224
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:51,518
Speaker 0: So, uh...

225
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:56,020
Speaker 1: Then again, there are some people who will, you know, pay to slide down, right?

226
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,599
Speaker 1: I think it'll do some tubing or some sledding, so...

227
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:05,460
Speaker 0: So there is a reason why pretty much every ski mountain on Earth bans tubes and sleds and any of those things, because they are considered...

228
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:06,219
Speaker 1: Because you can't steer them.

229
00:21:06,361 --> 00:21:07,660
Speaker 0: Nope, they are what you would call...

230
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:08,017
Speaker 1: Or control them.

231
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:09,940
Speaker 0: ...uncontrolled devices.

232
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,979
Speaker 0: And you can imagine exactly what that means.

233
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:15,200
Speaker 1: If you're just going, there's nothing you can do about it.

234
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,780
Speaker 1: You got to go one at a time, basically.

235
00:21:18,342 --> 00:21:24,340
Speaker 0: Like as a kid sledding, my main self-defense mechanism, if there was trouble, was to try to jump off of the sled.

236
00:21:25,143 --> 00:21:25,791
Speaker 1: Yeah, of course.

237
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:26,459
Speaker 1: What else can you do?

238
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,780
Speaker 1: The sled's doing what it's doing.

239
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:29,238
Speaker 1: You can't really steer it that much.

240
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:38,060
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, this is... You can watch someone slide on their ass over a kilometer down a mountain and crash into a net.

241
00:21:38,341 --> 00:21:41,359
Speaker 0: And it's funny because you know they're not hurt.

242
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:44,136
Speaker 1: All right.

243
00:21:45,340 --> 00:22:00,679
Speaker 1: So when I was in high school, right, I got the... I had money from working a part-time job and I was finally able to just go to... I had the ability, finally, to just go to fucking GameStop and buy video games or EB or whatever the hell store it was in those days.

244
00:22:02,922 --> 00:22:05,660
Speaker 1: And so the Game Boy Color came out and I was like, "You know what?

245
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:07,518
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna go fucking buy that thing on release

246
00:22:07,538 --> 00:22:07,720
Speaker 1: day.".

247
00:22:07,944 --> 00:22:08,739
Speaker 1: And I fucking did it.

248
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:10,180
Speaker 0: Man, I never had a Game Boy Color.

249
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:11,820
Speaker 1: I had a Game Boy Color.

250
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:12,980
Speaker 1: Then I had a Game Boy Advance.

251
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:13,765
Speaker 1: You know.

252
00:22:14,196 --> 00:22:14,380
Speaker 1: Anyway.

253
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:19,600
Speaker 1: So now, rest in peace, portable Nintendo lineup, right?

254
00:22:19,962 --> 00:22:22,679
Speaker 1: Now it's just Switch, which is both at once all the way over.

255
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:23,712
Speaker 1: Anyway.

256
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:26,280
Speaker 1: So, and I got the Game Boy Color.

257
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,239
Speaker 1: You know, it's like, "Well, I bought this.

258
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:37,236
Speaker 1: I can play Game Boy games on it and I can get some of those DX games that work on Game Boys and Game Boy Colors, but I want to get some Game Boy Color only games because otherwise what's the

259
00:22:37,256 --> 00:22:37,459
Speaker 1: point?".

260
00:22:38,103 --> 00:22:50,538
Speaker 1: And the premiere game was Mario Brothers Deluxe, which was, you know, up until that point in time, if you're in 1990, whatever it was, I don't know what year, seven, eight, I don't know.

261
00:22:52,188 --> 00:22:52,660
Speaker 1: I'm guessing.

262
00:22:54,783 --> 00:23:05,118
Speaker 1: It's like if you wanted to play Mario Brothers, Super Mario Brothers 1, you needed an NES or a PC with an emulator or something like that.

263
00:23:05,823 --> 00:23:10,674
Speaker 1: To play it portably, it's like, "Could I get a Game Boy that had Mario

264
00:23:10,714 --> 00:23:11,056
Speaker 1: Land?".

265
00:23:11,784 --> 00:23:11,958
Speaker 1: You know.

266
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:18,340
Speaker 1: But you couldn't play Mario Brothers 1 portably on any device that existed, really.

267
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:28,595
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like you could -- By the time we were in high school, if you got a moderately expensive laptop, you could theoretically run an NES emulator.

268
00:23:30,824 --> 00:23:39,920
Speaker 0: But I don't think you all really, unless you're as old as us, know what a laptop looked like, felt like, how much it weighed in that era.

269
00:23:41,782 --> 00:23:43,340
Speaker 0: The Steam Deck is on Marvel.

270
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:43,780
Speaker 0: Right.

271
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:46,236
Speaker 1: So nowadays, I'm like, "HD remakes,

272
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:46,599
Speaker 1: meh.".

273
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:53,720
Speaker 1: But at that exact moment, this was the way to play Super Mario Brothers 1 portably.

274
00:23:54,384 --> 00:23:55,159
Speaker 1: It was this game.

275
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:02,839
Speaker 1: And the game not only had Mario 1, it also had Mario 2, meaning the real Mario 2, the lost levels -- Not Doki Doki Panic.

276
00:24:03,964 --> 00:24:04,140
Speaker 1: Right.

277
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,980
Speaker 1: In color, on a small device, with a backlight.

278
00:24:09,083 --> 00:24:12,773
Speaker 1: The aspect ratio wasn't exactly the same as the original NES.

279
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:14,820
Speaker 1: It was a little bit different.

280
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:17,660
Speaker 1: But I couldn't tell the difference at the time.

281
00:24:18,181 --> 00:24:20,316
Speaker 1: It felt like I was playing Mario 1 straight up.

282
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,160
Speaker 1: And it had a lot of -- It was pretty nice, actually, all things considered.

283
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,820
Speaker 1: And it had extra features, one of those extra features being this little day planner.

284
00:24:34,047 --> 00:24:37,575
Speaker 1: They wanted to somehow be like, "Yeah, if you have this, it's also a

285
00:24:37,656 --> 00:24:37,958
Speaker 1: PDA.".

286
00:24:38,362 --> 00:24:43,399
Speaker 1: And I guess if you had a Game Boy printer, you could print, and it had all this extra stuff in there.

287
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:48,079
Speaker 0: Well, there was -- 'Cause Nintendo Power had a thing about it, and I was obsessed with it as a kid.

288
00:24:48,500 --> 00:25:00,660
Speaker 0: There was that Game Boy PDA thing that was both a cartridge and, as far as I could tell, never actually released keyboard, specifically for the Game Boy to be a PDA for real.

289
00:25:01,382 --> 00:25:01,513
Speaker 1: Yep.

290
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:03,438
Speaker 0: Nintendo Power had a whole spread about it.

291
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:04,307
Speaker 1: Yep.

292
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:16,740
Speaker 1: So this Game Boy Color, though, they had some PDA-ish features in this game as, like, a side extra bonus thing, and there's actually -- If you go back, there's a lot of things like that.

293
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:22,559
Speaker 1: You know, like, people seem to forget, like, the Wii just had a message calendar system in it and stuff, right?

294
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,838
Speaker 0: It's like -- Yeah, the DS had PictoChat.

295
00:25:25,122 --> 00:25:27,100
Speaker 1: The Wii had a weather app in it, right?

296
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:32,958
Speaker 0: It's like -- The regular DS had all this, like, local chat room stuff just built into it.

297
00:25:33,843 --> 00:25:34,877
Speaker 1: Yeah, the PictoChat, right?

298
00:25:34,897 --> 00:25:35,039
Speaker 1: Yeah.

299
00:25:35,623 --> 00:25:48,300
Speaker 1: So, anyway, there was PDA features in here, and there was this fortune-telling thing, and I guess if you wanted to see all the fortunes, you'd have to, like, open this game and check the fortunes, like, every day for a long period of time.

300
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:48,912
Speaker 1: It's like, "No one did

301
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:49,096
Speaker 1: that.".

302
00:25:49,945 --> 00:26:04,760
Speaker 1: But somebody here on my thing of the day basically broke the game apart, you know, went and inspected the ROM and found all the fortune-telling stuff and made a little app so that you could, you know, have your own little Mario Deluxe fortune thing.

303
00:26:04,882 --> 00:26:05,820
Speaker 1: I still have the cartridge.

304
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,680
Speaker 1: I don't know where my Game Boy Color went to.

305
00:26:08,941 --> 00:26:09,899
Speaker 1: I don't know what happened to it.

306
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:16,259
Speaker 1: But I have the cartridge, and I can stick it in a GBA to run it and see and play it if I wanted to.

307
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:18,900
Speaker 1: So, really fascinating.

308
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:23,260
Speaker 1: Just look at this side feature in a game that was completely forgotten.

309
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:25,219
Speaker 0: This is one of the beautiful things about the Internet.

310
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:34,919
Speaker 0: Any aspect of anything, there will be at least one person who cares about it enough to do a deep dive on it and bring it to the world.

311
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:35,622
Speaker 1: Right.

312
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:41,780
Speaker 1: It's like, I had it, and I only remembered that it existed because this person, you know, posted this thing online.

313
00:26:41,780 --> 00:26:42,428
Speaker 1: I'm like, "All right.

314
00:26:42,509 --> 00:26:43,440
Speaker 1: That was in that game.

315
00:26:43,825 --> 00:26:44,251
Speaker 1: I remember

316
00:26:44,291 --> 00:26:44,454
Speaker 1: now.".

317
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,780
Speaker 0: Bowser's Breath engulfs the future.

318
00:26:48,702 --> 00:26:48,965
Speaker 1: Yep.

319
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:50,139
Speaker 0: There it is.

320
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:56,497
Speaker 0: In the meta moment, the Geek Nights Book Club book is "The City We Became" by N.K.

321
00:26:56,537 --> 00:26:56,900
Speaker 0: Jemisin.

322
00:26:57,060 --> 00:26:59,440
Speaker 1: We're gonna do the show -- I finished reading it a while ago.

323
00:26:59,601 --> 00:27:03,460
Speaker 1: We're gonna -- I'm almost done reading.

324
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:05,471
Speaker 1: That book, I've read 1.8 more books.

325
00:27:08,183 --> 00:27:10,079
Speaker 0: We're gonna do a show about it in about a month.

326
00:27:10,521 --> 00:27:12,399
Speaker 0: You should easily be able to read this book by then.

327
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:15,059
Speaker 0: I highly recommend you read it with us.

328
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:26,139
Speaker 0: This book, if you have liked any of the books we have ever done on the Geek Nights Book Club, especially the books where we say something like, "Wow, that was a real Geek Nights-y book," you're gonna love the hell out of this book.

329
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:30,099
Speaker 1: Anything else?

330
00:27:32,869 --> 00:27:33,219
Speaker 0: We'll see.

331
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,417
Speaker 0: Convention's coming up.

332
00:27:35,822 --> 00:27:45,679
Speaker 0: There'll likely be at least one Geek Nights panel at PAX East, but I doubt we will be at PAX East beyond potentially doing that panel, potentially just me, potentially just me and Scott for a day.

333
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:46,938
Speaker 0: It's too soon to say.

334
00:27:48,341 --> 00:27:49,795
Speaker 0: Otherwise, I don't know.

335
00:27:49,815 --> 00:27:50,300
Speaker 0: We got nothing.

336
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,220
Speaker 0: We're working on the website.

337
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,160
Speaker 0: Well, Scott's mostly working on the website.

338
00:27:53,601 --> 00:27:57,220
Speaker 0: I'm working on some panel stuff for other cons that are online and virtual.

339
00:27:57,784 --> 00:27:59,020
Speaker 0: You might see some of that coming out.

340
00:27:59,723 --> 00:28:08,119
Speaker 0: In fact, you're gonna see an additional list of games for our Atari game design panel at some point in the near future that you can watch.

341
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:11,240
Speaker 0: Otherwise, just, I don't know, keep following us.

342
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:12,078
Speaker 0: I got nothing else new.

343
00:28:14,269 --> 00:28:26,960
Speaker 1: Once this website's done, then it's like I'm gonna be in this land of freedom where I won't have any obligation other than the job I have to make money and also maintaining life, right?

344
00:28:27,624 --> 00:28:31,759
Speaker 1: So sustaining myself with eating, cleaning, it's clothing myself, et cetera.

345
00:28:32,141 --> 00:28:38,480
Speaker 1: So I'm not gonna give any specific shit talk, but I will be doing something with that time.

346
00:28:38,962 --> 00:28:41,200
Speaker 1: I don't know what it is, but something.

347
00:28:41,882 --> 00:28:48,020
Speaker 1: And maybe one of those things I do with that time will produce something to share with the rest of the world.

348
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:52,320
Speaker 0: What you're saying is that you got a hopper and there's things in that hopper.

349
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:54,249
Speaker 1: Something might come out.

350
00:28:55,135 --> 00:28:55,739
Speaker 1: No promises.

351
00:28:58,204 --> 00:28:59,519
Speaker 0: All right, let's just get right into it.

352
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:04,539
Speaker 0: So this is a game from 2016 that we noticed and I pointed at.

353
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,699
Speaker 1: I knew it existed, and I knew what the name of it was.

354
00:29:08,643 --> 00:29:10,339
Speaker 1: And that was the extent of what I knew.

355
00:29:11,142 --> 00:29:13,260
Speaker 0: We knew that it was Mule Adjacent.

356
00:29:14,624 --> 00:29:15,820
Speaker 1: I didn't know that until recently.

357
00:29:16,365 --> 00:29:17,240
Speaker 0: We talked about that.

358
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:20,519
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure there's a Geek Nights episode where we mentioned it and said those exact words.

359
00:29:21,221 --> 00:29:23,879
Speaker 1: I don't think we've mentioned this game ever on Geek Nights before.

360
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:25,860
Speaker 0: Pretty sure we did it at some point, maybe in the forum.

361
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,500
Speaker 0: Well, anyway, this game, we're a little late to the party, but we've actually started playing it.

362
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:31,619
Speaker 1: A little late, six years late.

363
00:29:32,081 --> 00:29:33,050
Speaker 0: It's still going strong.

364
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:33,878
Speaker 0: It's had a bunch of DLC.

365
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,120
Speaker 0: It's free for multiplayer on the Epic Games Store like right now, apparently.

366
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,279
Speaker 1: Yeah, I bought a mega bundle of everything on Steam when it was a mega sale.

367
00:29:45,182 --> 00:29:47,680
Speaker 1: And I followed my policy of install it and play it immediately.

368
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:50,900
Speaker 1: And the game is Offworld Trading Company.

369
00:29:51,021 --> 00:29:57,000
Speaker 1: And what it is, is it's on paper, it's sort of what I always kept asking for, almost.

370
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,979
Speaker 1: It's like 90% of the way there.

371
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,777
Speaker 1: And that it's an RTS.

372
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:04,340
Speaker 1: We're talking StarCraft, we're talking Warcraft, right?

373
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:09,120
Speaker 1: Except you don't have to micromanage dudes fighting at all.

374
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:10,640
Speaker 1: There aren't any dudes to fight.

375
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:12,060
Speaker 1: There's none of that whatsoever.

376
00:30:12,401 --> 00:30:14,299
Speaker 0: It's just build the base, the game.

377
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:25,160
Speaker 1: It's you build the base, but then the base creates the resources on its own, just like you have peons making wood and stone in Warcraft, right?

378
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:36,280
Speaker 1: But then, once you have those goods, you basically play a stock market game with them, well, a commodities market game with them, where you're buying and selling them, trying to make a lot of money.

379
00:30:37,021 --> 00:30:44,240
Speaker 1: And then when you have enough money, you can start buying shares in yourself and also the other players' companies.

380
00:30:45,161 --> 00:30:49,319
Speaker 1: And then if you buy enough shares in someone else's company, they're dead.

381
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:50,539
Speaker 1: That's how you kill them.

382
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:56,520
Speaker 1: And so buying shares is sort of like converting money into victory points in sort of board game terms, right?

383
00:30:57,381 --> 00:31:01,639
Speaker 1: And once you bought everyone else out, you win and you play again, I guess.

384
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:08,202
Speaker 0: And it's basically, if I had to describe how this game feels, imagine

385
00:31:08,504 --> 00:31:08,846
Speaker 0: M.U.L.E.,

386
00:31:09,107 --> 00:31:11,720
Speaker 0: a game that I'm pretty sure we did a Geek Nights episode on, at least.

387
00:31:12,848 --> 00:31:13,399
Speaker 1: We should have.

388
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,219
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'll check that.

389
00:31:15,400 --> 00:31:15,501
Speaker 0: M.U.L.E.

390
00:31:15,521 --> 00:31:18,100
Speaker 1: is a historic and very important significant game.

391
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,300
Speaker 0: Yep, it's a game that we like.

392
00:31:19,520 --> 00:31:21,279
Speaker 0: We draw inspiration and ideas from.

393
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:23,299
Speaker 0: It's like one of those-- So does everybody.

394
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:24,578
Speaker 1: Everybody to us.

395
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:25,077
Speaker 0: Right?

396
00:31:25,722 --> 00:31:28,640
Speaker 0: It's literally one of the forgotten masters out there, like Sopwith.

397
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:35,923
Speaker 0: So basically, it's like that, but scaled up and with a modern sensibility because that

398
00:31:35,963 --> 00:31:36,345
Speaker 0: M.U.L.E.,

399
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:40,360
Speaker 0: as designed when it first came out, is a product of its era.

400
00:31:40,541 --> 00:31:45,880
Speaker 0: It has several aspects that are dated, that don't work that well, that are kind of arbitrary or random.

401
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:48,319
Speaker 1: It also has a lot more luck going on.

402
00:31:48,809 --> 00:31:48,979
Speaker 0: It does.

403
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:51,420
Speaker 0: Of World Trading does not have significant luck.

404
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,360
Speaker 0: If you lose this game, it's because you are terrible at this game.

405
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,320
Speaker 1: Or just not as good as the opponent.

406
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,416
Speaker 0: Yep, this game is hard to be good at.

407
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,257
Speaker 1: Yeah, very, yeah.

408
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:22,580
Speaker 0: But what it feels like playing is, imagine an RTS, but the RTS is, like I said, build the base, but next to that is a whole ass stock market with like 15 different things you can make and trade, and they all have prices that are going up and down based on what all the other players are doing in the game.

409
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:29,160
Speaker 0: It actually does act very closely like how a real stock market acts, or a real commodity market acts.

410
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:39,720
Speaker 1: If I have a shit ton of iron, and I hold onto it, and no one else really has any, and there's a demand for it, people need it, they're going to start buying it, right?

411
00:32:40,081 --> 00:32:47,660
Speaker 1: And the way the game is set up is so that there's never a situation where something's unavailable, right?

412
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,900
Speaker 1: There's never, like, there is no more iron.

413
00:32:51,001 --> 00:32:56,678
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen, because there's this colony, and you can always buy and sell with the colony.

414
00:32:56,718 --> 00:32:57,600
Speaker 1: that's not a player.

415
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:01,280
Speaker 0: Basically, it acts like there's a market maker, if you know how capital markets work.

416
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,500
Speaker 1: But the market maker has an infinite supply of all resources.

417
00:33:05,963 --> 00:33:12,158
Speaker 1: They're just set a price, so you might not be able to access that infinite supply if you don't have enough money.

418
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:16,620
Speaker 1: So if you want to buy iron, you can always buy iron, right?

419
00:33:16,821 --> 00:33:22,920
Speaker 1: But the price might be like $200 per iron, but you can get it, right?

420
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:34,940
Speaker 0: But let's say the price of iron is $200, and I have a shit ton of iron from earlier in the game, and I sell it all, every time I sell even one piece of iron, the price of iron drops a tiny bit, because more entered the market.

421
00:33:35,502 --> 00:33:39,780
Speaker 1: If someone buys an iron, you know, from the market, the price goes up.

422
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:43,000
Speaker 1: You don't directly trade with other players.

423
00:33:43,523 --> 00:33:45,920
Speaker 1: All your exchanges are with the market, right?

424
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:51,679
Speaker 1: You buy and sell your iron on the iron market, at the current market rate, whatever that is.

425
00:33:52,262 --> 00:33:54,999
Speaker 1: And every action you take changes that price.

426
00:33:55,961 --> 00:33:57,700
Speaker 1: So, have fun.

427
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:14,699
Speaker 0: Yep, so you interact, playing basically a real-time strategy game, building a base to get resources, and then buying and selling those resources on the market, and you have to mess with the market, because there is no possible way to make everything you need in this game.

428
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:22,679
Speaker 0: You cannot be self-sufficient, because unlike most RTSs where you grow forever, you can only grow so much.

429
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:31,789
Speaker 0: There's a finite number of buildings you can ever build with a little bit of plus or minus one based on events and things you can do in the game, but there's a limit.

430
00:34:31,969 --> 00:34:33,460
Speaker 0: You can only build so many things.

431
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:39,159
Speaker 0: It's not like old Civ games where you can upgrade everything all the way, build as many cities as you want.

432
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,219
Speaker 0: This game, you can only build so much.

433
00:34:41,963 --> 00:34:54,840
Speaker 1: Right, so if the game was only about money, you know, it's like, well, you could just, you know, concentrate on what's worth a lot and just ignore, you know, what does it matter if I'm trading iron or steel or carbon or whatever, right?

434
00:34:54,900 --> 00:35:00,739
Speaker 1: Well, it matters because you have a base, and that base has to be upgraded four times.

435
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:08,460
Speaker 1: And to upgrade the base four times based on which faction you've chosen, you're going to need specific resources to do so.

436
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:18,420
Speaker 1: So like with the really basic expansionist faction, in order to upgrade from level one to two, you need like a pile of steel and you need some glass, right?

437
00:35:19,005 --> 00:35:20,240
Speaker 1: And I think you need some aluminum.

438
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:25,000
Speaker 0: But like another faction will need chips and steel instead of those.

439
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:29,460
Speaker 1: You need to get specific resources to upgrade.

440
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:49,130
Speaker 1: So the beginning parts of the game are all about getting the resources you need to upgrade your base to the next level for the lowest price or producing them yourself, which is still an opportunity cost because you could be producing something else that's worth money, which is actually what matters, right?

441
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:58,860
Speaker 1: But you have to upgrade if you, you know, so there's a rush to upgrade and sort of a snowball effect because like Rym said, you have a set number of claims, which is it's a hex map.

442
00:35:59,421 --> 00:36:05,529
Speaker 1: So you can only build a number of buildings equal to the number of hexes that you have claims for.

443
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:07,140
Speaker 1: You start with what, like three or four claims?

444
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,079
Speaker 1: I forget how many, five?

445
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:11,840
Speaker 0: Well, there's one faction gets an extra one and there's all sorts of nonsense.

446
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:15,829
Speaker 1: But you only get so many claims and you build that many buildings and like.

447
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:16,419
Speaker 1: that's it.

448
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,348
Speaker 1: And you can't even to move.

449
00:36:18,408 --> 00:36:21,200
Speaker 1: the claims is sometimes you just can't.

450
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:25,239
Speaker 1: And like some of the factions can move, could move them a little bit.

451
00:36:25,565 --> 00:36:25,711
Speaker 0: Yeah.

452
00:36:26,503 --> 00:36:28,960
Speaker 1: A lot of the times, most of the time they're just permanent.

453
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,554
Speaker 1: So it's like you lay down an iron mine.

454
00:36:31,896 --> 00:36:35,760
Speaker 1: It's like, yeah, you could destroy it and build something else in that spot.

455
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:40,280
Speaker 1: But that's, you know, you can't move that claim to a different spot.

456
00:36:40,381 --> 00:36:44,880
Speaker 1: You can't, it's like if you suddenly want aluminum instead, it's like, well, there is no aluminum on that spot.

457
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:47,640
Speaker 1: You didn't use your claim on a spot that has aluminum.

458
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:52,500
Speaker 1: You can't build an aluminum mine until you upgrade and you get more spots.

459
00:36:53,222 --> 00:37:02,540
Speaker 1: And then eventually once you get to level five, four and five, but mostly five, now the game, everyone's going to have, you're not going to have infinity slots, but you have a lot of slots.

460
00:37:02,783 --> 00:37:03,780
Speaker 1: It's really flexible.

461
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:08,740
Speaker 1: So then it becomes the game of actually try to eliminate the other people.

462
00:37:09,302 --> 00:37:09,605
Speaker 1: Right.

463
00:37:09,747 --> 00:37:10,758
Speaker 1: You know, and such.

464
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,840
Speaker 0: So the factions also have their own powers.

465
00:37:16,263 --> 00:37:21,000
Speaker 0: Like each faction has radically different powers, a little bit like games like Dune in that they're radically symmetric.

466
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,060
Speaker 1: Well, like, you know, Starcraft, Zerg, Protoss, humans, all different.

467
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:24,448
Speaker 0: Exactly.

468
00:37:24,468 --> 00:37:24,919
Speaker 0: Just like an RTS.

469
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:28,212
Speaker 0: So like there's some, there's basic resources.

470
00:37:28,252 --> 00:37:29,820
Speaker 0: you can mine directly from the map.

471
00:37:30,182 --> 00:37:33,080
Speaker 0: And then there's derived resources like computer chips.

472
00:37:33,561 --> 00:37:39,680
Speaker 0: You have to put other resources into something to even make that resource at all, or just buy it from the market.

473
00:37:40,422 --> 00:37:49,040
Speaker 0: And those resources will become more or less valuable, not just based on what the players are doing, but based on what the colony that you're all sharing the map with is doing.

474
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:53,779
Speaker 0: As it grows, like it's slowly going to always need more and more food.

475
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:01,160
Speaker 0: Uh, but depending on the details, it might also need a lot of chips or might need glass or might do all sorts of nonsense.

476
00:38:01,704 --> 00:38:03,200
Speaker 0: And you kind of got to just watch this market.

477
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:09,220
Speaker 0: There's also a direct violence aspect of this game.

478
00:38:09,701 --> 00:38:13,099
Speaker 0: There's something called the black market and you have your cash.

479
00:38:13,963 --> 00:38:18,140
Speaker 0: You have cash that you use, you sell resources, you get cash, you can buy resources.

480
00:38:18,581 --> 00:38:26,320
Speaker 0: You can even tell buildings, hey, if you need a resource, like you need iron because you're the building that makes steel, just buy the iron as you need it.

481
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:29,019
Speaker 0: And the game will just start to automate all of that for you.

482
00:38:29,741 --> 00:38:34,340
Speaker 1: The game has a lot of quality of life features, right?

483
00:38:34,600 --> 00:38:39,400
Speaker 1: That allow you to like automatically sell, you know, this as it's produced, right?

484
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:42,830
Speaker 1: Automatically, you know, oh, it's the building that upgrades.

485
00:38:42,890 --> 00:38:46,560
Speaker 1: things automatically upgrade constantly, right?

486
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:52,600
Speaker 0: Like you don't have to manually buy the resources necessary to like build a building.

487
00:38:53,122 --> 00:39:01,760
Speaker 0: If you have enough cash and you build the building, the game will just automatically buy the right amount of resources with that cash at the current spot price on the market right then and there.

488
00:39:02,422 --> 00:39:02,522
Speaker 1: Yeah.

489
00:39:02,563 --> 00:39:09,780
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, maybe in order to upgrade your base, you know, you need a thousand iron and you have zero iron and iron is a dollar.

490
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,078
Speaker 1: It'll just tell you, hey, upgrading your base costs a thousand dollars.

491
00:39:13,641 --> 00:39:20,299
Speaker 1: Well, so tells you, and if you have a thousand dollars, you can just click upgrade base and it'll buy a thousand iron and upgrade the base.

492
00:39:20,742 --> 00:39:24,120
Speaker 0: You can also interact with the black market with that cash.

493
00:39:24,241 --> 00:39:31,880
Speaker 0: If you have enough cash on an interval that is faster or slower, depending on a bunch of factors, you can buy things from this black market.

494
00:39:32,202 --> 00:39:34,620
Speaker 0: Some of these things are direct attacks on opponents.

495
00:39:34,981 --> 00:39:42,920
Speaker 0: Some of these things are things like go steal some resources from somewhere on the map or give up a claim to remove it somewhere else.

496
00:39:43,523 --> 00:39:44,995
Speaker 0: There's a bunch of different things there.

497
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:50,640
Speaker 0: There's also a bunch of different maps that have different characteristics.

498
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:54,800
Speaker 0: So when you start the game, a limited number of factions are available.

499
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,819
Speaker 0: Not every faction is available in every game.

500
00:39:57,441 --> 00:40:00,120
Speaker 0: A limited number of black market things are available.

501
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:07,599
Speaker 0: Like every player sees what are the seven things that are even capable of being bought on the black market for this entire game.

502
00:40:09,504 --> 00:40:11,340
Speaker 0: And you kind of have to navigate.

503
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:18,540
Speaker 0: It's almost like it sets up the play box and then all the players know everything and have to make decisions accordingly.

504
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,519
Speaker 0: There's very little real randomness to it.

505
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:26,340
Speaker 1: Well, it is randomness in the setup, right?

506
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:28,280
Speaker 1: But not randomness per player.

507
00:40:29,144 --> 00:40:44,880
Speaker 1: I really like that because if you look at a game like Starcraft, even if you take Starcraft and you remove the thing I hate the most, which is the micromanaging the soldiers, it's still a game where you're like, "I play Zerg no matter what the map is.

508
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:51,628
Speaker 1: I'm a Zerg person and I've memorized the specific build order and 90% of the time it varies a little

509
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:51,929
Speaker 1: bit.".

510
00:40:54,781 --> 00:40:56,919
Speaker 1: But you're pretty much sticking to it.

511
00:40:57,604 --> 00:40:59,620
Speaker 1: You've determined that that's the optimal path.

512
00:41:00,060 --> 00:41:03,300
Speaker 1: Build this building, then this building, then this building, and so forth.

513
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:07,359
Speaker 1: And it's all executing this set plan.

514
00:41:08,381 --> 00:41:16,916
Speaker 1: And there isn't a lot of decision making that happens during the game until the mid or late game when it's like, "All right, what did they

515
00:41:16,956 --> 00:41:17,117
Speaker 1: do?".

516
00:41:17,941 --> 00:41:19,478
Speaker 1: Little rock, paper, scissors going on.

517
00:41:20,404 --> 00:41:22,420
Speaker 1: And also the execution component with the micro.

518
00:41:23,261 --> 00:41:26,799
Speaker 1: In Offworld Trading Company, you start, you see the map.

519
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:31,418
Speaker 1: Okay, you see which resources are plentiful and which ones aren't, and it's different every time.

520
00:41:32,162 --> 00:41:35,679
Speaker 1: And then you see what's available in the black market, which is different every time.

521
00:41:36,262 --> 00:41:38,539
Speaker 1: And you see which factions you have to choose from.

522
00:41:38,881 --> 00:41:42,820
Speaker 1: There's only four in each, but there's more than four in the whole game.

523
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:44,640
Speaker 0: Like we were playing multiplayer the other night.

524
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:47,920
Speaker 0: I'm only good at, well good, I'm making quotes here.

525
00:41:48,321 --> 00:41:52,080
Speaker 0: I am only minimally proficient in one of the four factions.

526
00:41:52,562 --> 00:41:55,960
Speaker 1: And if that faction just might not be available that game.

527
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,140
Speaker 0: And it just wasn't in the first game we played.

528
00:41:58,621 --> 00:42:00,151
Speaker 0: And I did not do well.

529
00:42:01,097 --> 00:42:01,560
Speaker 0: It was a problem.

530
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:09,240
Speaker 1: So now you have to decide based on the map what the black market is and what factions are available.

531
00:42:09,841 --> 00:42:11,359
Speaker 1: Which faction do you choose?

532
00:42:11,922 --> 00:42:14,460
Speaker 1: Where do you start on the map, right?

533
00:42:14,661 --> 00:42:21,060
Speaker 1: And then if you're not the first person to start, you now also have additional information of, well, they chose that faction.

534
00:42:21,764 --> 00:42:24,360
Speaker 1: Should I change my mind about which one I was going to choose?

535
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,560
Speaker 0: And the default way multiplayer works is real fun.

536
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:30,120
Speaker 0: Because single player against all AIs does this differently.

537
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:32,780
Speaker 0: But with multiplayer, there's debt.

538
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:36,819
Speaker 0: And we'll talk about debt in a minute, because debt is a huge fascinating part of this game.

539
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:41,919
Speaker 0: Debt has caused many funny things to happen when we played this multiplayer.

540
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:43,910
Speaker 0: Not just to you.

541
00:42:44,031 --> 00:42:44,354
Speaker 0: I hit D12.

542
00:42:46,281 --> 00:42:49,400
Speaker 0: My credit rating was pretty naturally bad.

543
00:42:49,501 --> 00:42:51,137
Speaker 0: And my stock price was approaching zero.

544
00:42:52,641 --> 00:43:01,999
Speaker 0: So basically, the earlier you play, so everyone's looking at the map, and there's an amount of debt, and it's very high.

545
00:43:02,642 --> 00:43:10,820
Speaker 0: And as you're watching, that amount of debt is slowly ticking down and getting closer and closer and closer from a horribly negative number to zero.

546
00:43:11,981 --> 00:43:22,580
Speaker 1: As soon as you click... So this is like, it's interesting because you could just start playing immediately, which would give you a head start and first pick of your location.

547
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:25,700
Speaker 0: And you start with a D credit rating and a ton of debt.

548
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,040
Speaker 1: Your debt is enormous if you do that.

549
00:43:28,360 --> 00:43:32,540
Speaker 1: So what really it's doing is, it's like, you're not going to start that early.

550
00:43:33,402 --> 00:43:34,219
Speaker 1: You're just not.

551
00:43:34,661 --> 00:43:39,898
Speaker 1: So you're giving everyone time to look at the map and see what's going on.

552
00:43:41,083 --> 00:43:46,860
Speaker 1: And then by the time you're done looking, now maybe you'll start thinking about actually clicking.

553
00:43:47,403 --> 00:43:56,100
Speaker 1: And it's a pretty clever way to start the game immediately, but also give you time and not just favoring someone who clicks the fastest.

554
00:43:56,320 --> 00:44:03,740
Speaker 0: But it also handles directly the situation that a lot of games where you have a starting position have, where some positions are just better.

555
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:14,880
Speaker 0: So when we played this multiplayer the other night, in two different games, once it happened to me and once it happened to Scott, two players were looking at the exact same spot.

556
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,739
Speaker 0: You can't see what anyone else is doing until they click.

557
00:44:17,224 --> 00:44:18,400
Speaker 0: We're just looking, looking, looking.

558
00:44:19,601 --> 00:44:26,239
Speaker 0: I'm hovering over a spot and I see the debt counter gets to a point where I think, all right, I could deal with that debt.

559
00:44:26,702 --> 00:44:28,740
Speaker 0: I click and a base appears.

560
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:34,060
Speaker 0: And I realize in that second that our friend Chris had in fact placed the base there.

561
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:36,474
Speaker 0: He clicked frames before me.

562
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:37,960
Speaker 1: Same exact moment.

563
00:44:38,682 --> 00:44:42,240
Speaker 1: I also had a situation where I clicked to put a base and it was like, nope.

564
00:44:42,443 --> 00:44:43,339
Speaker 1: And I'm like, what do you mean, no?

565
00:44:43,461 --> 00:44:44,439
Speaker 1: I'm like, click, click, click.

566
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,340
Speaker 1: It's like someone, other base just comes out and it's like the exact same moment.

567
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:55,479
Speaker 1: You couldn't, like, if it had landed a few seconds earlier, like even two seconds earlier, I would have been like, I wouldn't have clicked my mouse.

568
00:44:55,768 --> 00:44:55,956
Speaker 0: Yup.

569
00:44:56,282 --> 00:44:57,840
Speaker 1: And I would, I would have been like, oh, okay.

570
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:00,840
Speaker 1: They took more debt, but literally the same second.

571
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:02,137
Speaker 1: It was like, come on.

572
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:09,220
Speaker 0: But it's such a fun mechanic because the longer you wait, the better off your start is, but potentially.

573
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:14,360
Speaker 1: Well, not if you don't get the good, you've got to weigh that against getting the good spot on the map.

574
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:22,460
Speaker 1: And not only the good spot on the map, but if you go down earlier, you start producing goods and getting your way on your way to upgrading to level two.

575
00:45:23,000 --> 00:45:25,219
Speaker 1: Other people's bases haven't even landed yet.

576
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:28,280
Speaker 0: So one of the games I won, I started, you're doing nothing.

577
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:35,580
Speaker 0: I started way earlier than everyone else and I had a ton of debt, but I had two steel mills operational before another player even laid their base.

578
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:36,300
Speaker 1: And I won.

579
00:45:36,602 --> 00:45:36,800
Speaker 1: Exactly.

580
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,479
Speaker 0: So there was something going on there.

581
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,620
Speaker 0: So let's talk about debt because this is sort of the fascinating part of this game.

582
00:45:42,660 --> 00:45:53,459
Speaker 0: And this is how the quality of life of the, like how all these different quality of life features of the game work together so well to remove a lot of the annoying pain of most RTSs.

583
00:45:54,322 --> 00:45:55,180
Speaker 0: The game has the market.

584
00:45:55,801 --> 00:46:07,660
Speaker 0: And if you are buying things automatically that must be bought, like energy, for example, power, your debt's just racking up in the background.

585
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:08,978
Speaker 0: It's not taking away from your cash.

586
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:10,258
Speaker 1: If you don't have any money for it.

587
00:46:10,581 --> 00:46:10,702
Speaker 1: Yup.

588
00:46:11,026 --> 00:46:12,079
Speaker 0: But it just racks up debt.

589
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:14,420
Speaker 0: Debt might be fine.

590
00:46:15,282 --> 00:46:19,400
Speaker 0: You can have a bunch of debt, but your debt, one, there'll be interest.

591
00:46:20,021 --> 00:46:26,440
Speaker 0: And the worse your credit rating is, the worse the interest will be on the debt, regardless of the number of the debt.

592
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:33,639
Speaker 0: Your credit rating is determined by how bad your debt is relative to the other players.

593
00:46:35,703 --> 00:46:36,880
Speaker 0: There's a few other factors.

594
00:46:37,080 --> 00:46:43,000
Speaker 0: It's actually a fairly complex market, but you don't really need to know those details unless you decide to try to go pro with this game.

595
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:49,960
Speaker 1: The point is a lot of debt ruins your stock price and makes it easy for other people to buy you out and eliminate you from the game.

596
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:56,400
Speaker 0: And if your debt's too bad, if you have a de-credit rating, you can't even buy shit from the black market anymore.

597
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,900
Speaker 0: So the cool part about debt is you can accrue debt on purpose.

598
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:05,599
Speaker 0: You can pay debt off as you feel like it.

599
00:47:06,042 --> 00:47:07,960
Speaker 0: It's just one more mechanic in the game.

600
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:14,060
Speaker 0: The only things you cannot go into debt for are you cannot buy something from the black market with debt.

601
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:14,818
Speaker 0: You gotta use cash.

602
00:47:15,422 --> 00:47:20,400
Speaker 0: And you cannot buy any resource except power via debt.

603
00:47:20,841 --> 00:47:26,420
Speaker 0: If you need iron and you don't have any cash, you can't buy iron by going into debt.

604
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,000
Speaker 0: Your buildings that need iron just fucking stop working.

605
00:47:30,122 --> 00:47:30,806
Speaker 1: Yup.

606
00:47:30,987 --> 00:47:33,140
Speaker 1: You could sell something else and then buy iron.

607
00:47:33,901 --> 00:47:34,585
Speaker 0: Yup.

608
00:47:34,605 --> 00:47:37,840
Speaker 0: So you're usually trying to make a machine where like I make a bunch of food.

609
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,460
Speaker 0: I sell that food to afford the iron because I couldn't get any iron.

610
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:42,809
Speaker 0: Use the iron to make steel.

611
00:47:42,870 --> 00:47:44,060
Speaker 0: I sell the steel for a profit.

612
00:47:44,380 --> 00:47:48,280
Speaker 0: Like you're trying to make a fairly complex supply chain and market for yourself.

613
00:47:49,200 --> 00:48:00,700
Speaker 1: There are some resources that you make because they're just worth a lot of money and what it takes to produce them doesn't cost as much as what you get for selling them.

614
00:48:00,880 --> 00:48:01,759
Speaker 1: And that's just business.

615
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:04,472
Speaker 1: And there are some resources where it's like power.

616
00:48:07,140 --> 00:48:12,160
Speaker 1: It's like if I don't build a power plant, then I'm going to have to buy power from the market constantly.

617
00:48:12,381 --> 00:48:17,200
Speaker 0: And I've played games where for various reasons the price of power skyrockets.

618
00:48:17,721 --> 00:48:22,440
Speaker 0: And if you don't have enough power generation, you're losing like a thousand dollars a second.

619
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:22,581
Speaker 0: Right.

620
00:48:23,024 --> 00:48:25,560
Speaker 1: It's like the price of power might tank to like a dollar.

621
00:48:25,681 --> 00:48:27,560
Speaker 1: And you're like, oh, I'll just turn off my power plants.

622
00:48:27,740 --> 00:48:30,273
Speaker 1: You just buy power from the market and use debt for it or whatever.

623
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:32,219
Speaker 1: And who cares?

624
00:48:32,682 --> 00:48:35,019
Speaker 1: But then suddenly the price of power goes way up.

625
00:48:35,562 --> 00:48:38,059
Speaker 1: And remember the claims are locked in.

626
00:48:38,200 --> 00:48:50,100
Speaker 1: If you don't have a claim on a spot that's good for a power plant or an unused claim, suddenly your debt starts going up because you have buildings and those buildings are operating and they need power.

627
00:48:50,622 --> 00:48:55,100
Speaker 1: So it's like you're in the market to buy resources to run your buildings.

628
00:48:55,521 --> 00:49:02,560
Speaker 1: And hopefully what comes out the other end of those buildings is worth more than what goes into them at all times to some extent.

629
00:49:03,361 --> 00:49:13,760
Speaker 0: So one other aspect of the game, which is the final like core game mechanic other than victory, is there are five special buildings that do a bunch of different stuff.

630
00:49:13,940 --> 00:49:21,080
Speaker 0: And they take the game from being fairly simplistic into being an infinite sea of human decision making.

631
00:49:21,620 --> 00:49:24,280
Speaker 1: There's a patent lab that lets you get special abilities.

632
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,400
Speaker 1: There's an upgrade building that just lets you upgrade and make other buildings better.

633
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,340
Speaker 0: Both of those require potions, basically like chemicals as fuel to work.

634
00:49:34,442 --> 00:49:37,580
Speaker 1: There's one that's the hacker array that lets you manipulate the market.

635
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:38,948
Speaker 0: Drive the prices up or down.

636
00:49:40,825 --> 00:49:43,020
Speaker 1: Just fake the market, at least temporarily.

637
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:47,480
Speaker 1: There's the off world trade here, right, which is where the game gets its name from.

638
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:55,360
Speaker 1: It's basically a rocket launch pad that gives you access to a second market for all the resources that has different prices.

639
00:49:55,621 --> 00:50:01,340
Speaker 1: because you're selling them, you know, you're basically putting, it's like, oh, iron isn't worth anything on this planet.

640
00:50:01,822 --> 00:50:05,260
Speaker 1: Let me put my iron in a rocket and sell it to another planet.

641
00:50:05,721 --> 00:50:12,160
Speaker 1: And, you know, you got to check the off world market because it's off world trading company and see what the off world prices are.

642
00:50:12,422 --> 00:50:14,360
Speaker 1: They're going to be different than the local prices.

643
00:50:14,981 --> 00:50:21,760
Speaker 1: And you can make a lot of money and it just continuously firing rockets as long as you can keep fueling them and whatnot.

644
00:50:22,046 --> 00:50:22,297
Speaker 0: Yep.

645
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:25,860
Speaker 1: So say the last one is the pleasure dome.

646
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:27,537
Speaker 1: I wonder what happens in there.

647
00:50:28,860 --> 00:50:29,579
Speaker 1: Pleasure dome is just pleasure.

648
00:50:29,941 --> 00:50:30,360
Speaker 0: Print money.

649
00:50:31,402 --> 00:50:33,740
Speaker 1: Yeah, you build pleasure domes and they make money.

650
00:50:34,442 --> 00:50:42,160
Speaker 1: You build them next to the habitats in the colony and if people visit them and you just get free money and it's a way to win.

651
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,959
Speaker 1: If you get a lot of pleasure domes, you can make a lot of money and win that way.

652
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:51,340
Speaker 0: And then the final mechanic, the way you actually win, like the hit points of you as a player is the stock market.

653
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,880
Speaker 0: Your goal is literally to have enough cash to buy out all the other players and own them as subsidiaries.

654
00:50:57,642 --> 00:50:58,624
Speaker 1: All that other stuff.

655
00:50:58,684 --> 00:51:04,920
Speaker 1: It's like you're getting resources to upgrade your base and then you're upgrading your base so that you can build a machine that makes money.

656
00:51:05,260 --> 00:51:12,340
Speaker 1: And you're building a machine that makes money so that you can buy everyone else's shares until you own all the companies on this planet.

657
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:14,279
Speaker 1: You have a monopoly and then you win.

658
00:51:14,640 --> 00:51:14,709
Speaker 0: Yep.

659
00:51:16,284 --> 00:51:18,439
Speaker 0: It's real direct and straightforward and fun.

660
00:51:19,101 --> 00:51:26,500
Speaker 0: And if someone gets knocked out of the game, their faction just keeps running and you can still buy shares in it and just collect profits from it.

661
00:51:27,091 --> 00:51:27,520
Speaker 0: Basically.

662
00:51:28,581 --> 00:51:30,513
Speaker 1: And they are mercifully.

663
00:51:30,594 --> 00:51:31,600
Speaker 1: They don't have to keep playing.

664
00:51:32,040 --> 00:51:36,420
Speaker 1: It's like if you tank at this game real bad, it's a lot like Age of Steam.

665
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,271
Speaker 1: Someone will just buy all your shares and you're eliminated and you can go do something else.

666
00:51:40,311 --> 00:51:42,418
Speaker 1: Go eat a snack or go home.

667
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:43,452
Speaker 1: Yep.

668
00:51:43,900 --> 00:51:44,359
Speaker 1: Or whatever.

669
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:51,340
Speaker 0: But much like Civilization as well, when the game ends, you get a million charts.

670
00:51:51,681 --> 00:51:53,140
Speaker 0: Everything that happened in the game.

671
00:51:53,221 --> 00:51:55,600
Speaker 0: Like you see the full story of how it went down.

672
00:51:55,700 --> 00:51:56,839
Speaker 0: Look at the market over time.

673
00:51:57,323 --> 00:51:58,780
Speaker 0: Look at who was attacking who.

674
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:02,300
Speaker 0: Like, oh, it was Rym who was buying all those EMPs the whole time.

675
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:02,856
Speaker 0: There's proof.

676
00:52:04,820 --> 00:52:05,699
Speaker 1: So, let's see.

677
00:52:05,820 --> 00:52:07,200
Speaker 1: Good things about this game.

678
00:52:07,341 --> 00:52:08,678
Speaker 1: Obviously, I already said it's an RTS.

679
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:10,059
Speaker 1: We don't have to micromanage dudes.

680
00:52:10,202 --> 00:52:10,699
Speaker 1: That's great.

681
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:10,991
Speaker 0: Yep.

682
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:15,100
Speaker 1: It's also, you know, I love stock market thing.

683
00:52:15,180 --> 00:52:17,878
Speaker 1: I love how it's like really board gamey.

684
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,320
Speaker 0: The stock market feels like I'm playing a complex board game.

685
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:22,418
Speaker 0: Like it's just really fun.

686
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:27,319
Speaker 1: Unfortunately, it just feels like a board game that's, you know, doesn't have turns and it's going really too fast.

687
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:29,218
Speaker 0: We're not good at this game.

688
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,239
Speaker 1: No, I'm awful at this game.

689
00:52:31,841 --> 00:52:38,558
Speaker 1: And despite, you know, it has all those quality of life features automatically by turning, you know, automatically do this.

690
00:52:39,071 --> 00:52:39,260
Speaker 1: Right.

691
00:52:39,641 --> 00:52:44,376
Speaker 1: You really, once you get the keyboard shortcuts down, you understand the really good user interface.

692
00:52:46,181 --> 00:52:49,700
Speaker 1: It's like you never feel like there's no hassles or busy work.

693
00:52:49,826 --> 00:52:50,020
Speaker 1: Right.

694
00:52:50,201 --> 00:52:54,280
Speaker 1: Everything you're doing is like some sort of, you know, real decision that matters.

695
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,840
Speaker 0: Every click is material.

696
00:52:57,780 --> 00:53:01,940
Speaker 0: And APM could even matter up to a point, but not to the degree of like a Starcraft.

697
00:53:03,223 --> 00:53:05,039
Speaker 1: No, it is knowing that it matters at all.

698
00:53:05,300 --> 00:53:07,697
Speaker 1: But regardless, it's way better than the other options.

699
00:53:08,140 --> 00:53:10,800
Speaker 0: Let's say the price of glass is skyrocketing.

700
00:53:11,203 --> 00:53:13,460
Speaker 0: And let's say me and Scott both have a shit ton of glass.

701
00:53:13,863 --> 00:53:15,340
Speaker 0: We're playing real time chicken.

702
00:53:15,701 --> 00:53:21,794
Speaker 0: Who sells all their fucking glass first, captures those profits and ruins the market for the other one.

703
00:53:22,602 --> 00:53:22,958
Speaker 1: Exactly.

704
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:27,076
Speaker 1: Because if I have 100 glass and I just sell it all, it's like, well, the price just goes down.

705
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,497
Speaker 1: And now if rim tries to sell his, he's getting less money for his same amount of glass than I got.

706
00:53:32,461 --> 00:53:35,460
Speaker 0: So the challenges with this game, like I really like it.

707
00:53:35,581 --> 00:53:37,059
Speaker 0: I'm going to keep playing the shit out of it.

708
00:53:37,260 --> 00:53:39,160
Speaker 1: I would like to try to get better at it because.

709
00:53:39,728 --> 00:53:39,880
Speaker 1: Right.

710
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:43,940
Speaker 1: So the place we're at now in this game is like skill wise.

711
00:53:44,463 --> 00:53:46,839
Speaker 1: You know, I don't want to give two strategy tips because I don't have any.

712
00:53:47,664 --> 00:53:48,699
Speaker 0: I could like to the spreadsheet.

713
00:53:49,620 --> 00:53:49,716
Speaker 1: Yeah.

714
00:53:50,101 --> 00:53:56,720
Speaker 1: In single player, when I play against the AI at the normal difficulty, I can beat it pretty reliably.

715
00:53:57,341 --> 00:54:03,259
Speaker 1: But when you play single player, you have the ability to pause the game so you can just pause and think about what you're going to do.

716
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:04,280
Speaker 1: It's like you're about to upgrade.

717
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:04,900
Speaker 1: You're like, pause.

718
00:54:04,981 --> 00:54:06,199
Speaker 1: Where am I going to put my claims?

719
00:54:06,821 --> 00:54:07,879
Speaker 1: I'm going to go there, there and there.

720
00:54:08,004 --> 00:54:08,338
Speaker 1: All right.

721
00:54:08,761 --> 00:54:11,040
Speaker 1: And you unpause and put the claims and really quick.

722
00:54:11,241 --> 00:54:12,999
Speaker 1: And it's like, it's not an issue.

723
00:54:13,702 --> 00:54:18,540
Speaker 1: But when you play multiplayer, there is no pause at all at the game.

724
00:54:18,680 --> 00:54:22,160
Speaker 1: It just has a speed that's too fast for a slow old guy.

725
00:54:23,020 --> 00:54:25,100
Speaker 1: And it's like, I cannot keep up with it.

726
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:30,180
Speaker 1: Like I'll upgrade my base and be like, uh, uh, uh, I mean, every time I go, uh, I'm losing money, right?

727
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,679
Speaker 1: Not using the claims, don't have buildings down.

728
00:54:33,481 --> 00:54:38,358
Speaker 1: Uh, uh, you know, the market's moving and I'm like, uh, I'm busy paying attention to something else.

729
00:54:38,522 --> 00:54:39,158
Speaker 1: Uh, Oh God.

730
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:39,798
Speaker 1: Oh God.

731
00:54:40,006 --> 00:54:40,215
Speaker 1: Yup.

732
00:54:40,481 --> 00:54:42,609
Speaker 0: But also the game is very different.

733
00:54:42,729 --> 00:54:46,119
Speaker 0: playing against humans versus the AI, especially when you're not good.

734
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:55,858
Speaker 1: The AI and the real time mode, when we played three against there, three of us and one AI, it destroyed us.

735
00:54:56,220 --> 00:55:00,519
Speaker 1: Its base was upgraded one level ahead of our basis at all times.

736
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:04,540
Speaker 0: Its stock price was double any of ours within a couple minutes.

737
00:55:05,461 --> 00:55:10,757
Speaker 1: I don't know what it was doing, but it was just like better than us in every conceivable way.

738
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:15,719
Speaker 1: And that was the regular difficulty AI, not the cheaty, harder AI.

739
00:55:16,540 --> 00:55:16,696
Speaker 0: Yup.

740
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:30,840
Speaker 0: The other, uh, challenge with the game is that the learning curve to getting to the point where even at, where you could play the game, multiplayer and kind of understand what's going on and like feel like you understand why you lost up to a point.

741
00:55:31,841 --> 00:55:36,879
Speaker 0: It takes five to 10 hours probably to get to that point.

742
00:55:37,281 --> 00:55:44,840
Speaker 1: The tutorial was a really good tutorial and that it didn't break and it introduced a lot of concepts, but it was by no means complete.

743
00:55:45,404 --> 00:55:46,700
Speaker 1: It didn't tell you how to win.

744
00:55:46,840 --> 00:55:47,726
Speaker 1: It only told you like.

745
00:55:47,867 --> 00:55:49,880
Speaker 1: it basically was like an interface tutorial.

746
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:54,000
Speaker 0: Not really a game, but to be clear, it was necessary.

747
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:58,000
Speaker 0: Like that tutorial is necessary to even be ready to engage with.

748
00:55:58,100 --> 00:55:59,419
Speaker 0: So how do I actually play this game?

749
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:04,020
Speaker 1: You need like the tutorial is like, it'll tell you click here to buy glass.

750
00:56:04,242 --> 00:56:05,720
Speaker 1: Now click here to upgrade your base.

751
00:56:05,801 --> 00:56:06,879
Speaker 1: Now you have more claims.

752
00:56:07,420 --> 00:56:17,140
Speaker 1: So it like it, but it's like it told you what to do, but it didn't tell you why you were doing it or why you might do something else instead or what your other options were.

753
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,760
Speaker 1: It was literally like click here, now click here.

754
00:56:19,960 --> 00:56:30,096
Speaker 0: So I would say you have to play the tutorials first, then play the tutorial like challenges where it makes you play a faction and like win on a predefined map until you can beat all of those.

755
00:56:31,103 --> 00:56:32,698
Speaker 0: Then play some skirmishes with AIs.

756
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:33,637
Speaker 0: It'll crush you.

757
00:56:34,162 --> 00:56:54,480
Speaker 0: And then if you want to actually try to get good at this game, the only way to engage with it is, in my opinion, is kind of like with chess in that at that point, memorize a couple of basic openings just to get you like into the game enough to try to interact with the more advanced concepts.

758
00:56:54,880 --> 00:57:02,020
Speaker 0: Like I've memorized a couple of build orders that are not like perfect build orders, but they let me get further into the game.

759
00:57:02,931 --> 00:57:03,099
Speaker 1: Yep.

760
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:04,163
Speaker 1: I mean, that's the.

761
00:57:04,284 --> 00:57:06,380
Speaker 0: I think that's, you know, I'm going to link to the spreadsheet.

762
00:57:06,540 --> 00:57:09,200
Speaker 0: Scott kept talking about the spreadsheet, but I didn't know what it was.

763
00:57:09,340 --> 00:57:10,740
Speaker 0: Then finally, what the fuck spreadsheet?

764
00:57:10,842 --> 00:57:11,819
Speaker 0: And you sent me a link to it.

765
00:57:12,321 --> 00:57:17,520
Speaker 0: And it is literally just this Google Doc that tells you how to someone made it some player of this game.

766
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,560
Speaker 1: Someone made a Google Doc, which is basically the ultimate strategy guide for this game.

767
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:22,339
Speaker 0: It's real good.

768
00:57:22,440 --> 00:57:29,060
Speaker 0: Like when to found an expansive HQ versus a robotic HQ when not to found it.

769
00:57:29,361 --> 00:57:35,240
Speaker 0: Here's a basic build order and advanced build order and a bunch of expert build like guidelines.

770
00:57:36,865 --> 00:57:37,840
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think that's the thing.

771
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,680
Speaker 1: I don't the negative points of this game because it's not perfect.

772
00:57:41,827 --> 00:57:42,060
Speaker 1: Right.

773
00:57:42,201 --> 00:57:46,500
Speaker 1: Is that, you know, it is a little fast for old man Scott, but I guess that's just because I'm slow.

774
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:46,897
Speaker 1: Right.

775
00:57:47,061 --> 00:57:48,240
Speaker 1: It's like it's a it's an artist.

776
00:57:48,440 --> 00:57:48,520
Speaker 1: Yes.

777
00:57:48,601 --> 00:57:50,820
Speaker 1: It's not like it's false advertising here.

778
00:57:50,922 --> 00:57:51,240
Speaker 1: Right.

779
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:56,140
Speaker 1: It's if you don't want an artist at all, go play a turn based game instead.

780
00:57:56,420 --> 00:57:56,612
Speaker 0: Go places.

781
00:57:57,002 --> 00:57:57,680
Speaker 0: This is game.

782
00:57:57,922 --> 00:58:00,260
Speaker 0: This game shines with time pressure.

783
00:58:00,500 --> 00:58:01,820
Speaker 0: That is what makes it fun.

784
00:58:03,300 --> 00:58:06,940
Speaker 1: It does have, though, a little bit of that build order stuff, right?

785
00:58:07,300 --> 00:58:09,720
Speaker 0: Though, like I did watch some people are good at it.

786
00:58:09,840 --> 00:58:10,539
Speaker 0: I watched some streams.

787
00:58:11,300 --> 00:58:14,732
Speaker 0: The build orders that are memorizable are just.

788
00:58:14,993 --> 00:58:23,220
Speaker 0: they're very good, but they're worthless against someone who knows what they're doing because the people who know what they're doing adapt radically to what other people are doing.

789
00:58:24,080 --> 00:58:24,317
Speaker 1: The other.

790
00:58:24,620 --> 00:58:27,320
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like is a lot of information to take in.

791
00:58:27,461 --> 00:58:28,860
Speaker 1: It's not really the speed of clicking.

792
00:58:29,060 --> 00:58:31,139
Speaker 1: It's the speed of like, what the heck is going on?

793
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:32,559
Speaker 1: You got people can put.

794
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,760
Speaker 1: No, it's like put their buildings in their area.

795
00:58:34,861 --> 00:58:35,938
Speaker 1: People can put buildings forever.

796
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,320
Speaker 1: So it's like you can't even tell, like, what is that other person doing?

797
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,440
Speaker 1: What buildings they have?

798
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,340
Speaker 1: What's their strategy?

799
00:58:41,821 --> 00:58:50,823
Speaker 1: And in the time it takes, like look at their base and assess that shit has happened and you've missed, you know, price on something could have crashed or skyrocketed or, you know, I

800
00:58:50,843 --> 00:58:56,580
Speaker 0: feel like I've gotten to the point where I don't have to follow a strict build order to not lose when I play the robots.

801
00:58:57,365 --> 00:58:58,740
Speaker 0: And that is as far as I've gotten.

802
00:58:58,840 --> 00:58:59,640
Speaker 0: That's like the equivalent.

803
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:00,135
Speaker 1: Very.

804
00:59:00,701 --> 00:59:07,979
Speaker 1: I'm wildly inconsistent where it's like I'll either, you know, do great or kind of great or just completely collapse.

805
00:59:08,382 --> 00:59:10,840
Speaker 0: There's the game where you bought me out like right away.

806
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:14,319
Speaker 0: There was another game where I heard stock price was approaching zero.

807
00:59:15,241 --> 00:59:16,485
Speaker 1: You know, it's like I have.

808
00:59:16,605 --> 00:59:21,660
Speaker 1: the problem is, is that I try to use normal common sense heuristics.

809
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:24,960
Speaker 1: Like I look at a map and there's like no iron on it anywhere.

810
00:59:25,060 --> 00:59:30,760
Speaker 1: And I'm like, damn, I'll settle that iron and then I'll write the price should go way up and then I'll sell it.

811
00:59:30,863 --> 00:59:31,180
Speaker 1: All right.

812
00:59:31,260 --> 00:59:35,098
Speaker 1: It's like, you know, maybe I'll even use the hacker rate to boost the price of iron even higher.

813
00:59:35,504 --> 00:59:36,199
Speaker 1: Let's just do that.

814
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:36,780
Speaker 0: What did I do?

815
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,400
Speaker 0: Found a scientific HQ, make steel directly by founding on that iron.

816
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,360
Speaker 0: And who cares about iron?

817
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:46,359
Speaker 1: No, but that's like, no, I'm saying like I played against the AI and I had a monopoly.

818
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,960
Speaker 1: There was no other iron.

819
00:59:48,211 --> 00:59:48,400
Speaker 1: Right.

820
00:59:48,523 --> 00:59:49,218
Speaker 1: I had it all.

821
00:59:50,044 --> 00:59:53,540
Speaker 1: And the whole game, the price of iron was trash.

822
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:56,320
Speaker 1: And I'm like, there's no iron on the fucking map.

823
00:59:56,580 --> 00:59:58,100
Speaker 1: The supply, I have all of it.

824
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,880
Speaker 1: I'm fucking De Beers of iron.

825
01:00:00,380 --> 01:00:04,420
Speaker 1: Why is the price never going up unless I use like the hacker array?

826
01:00:04,521 --> 01:00:05,839
Speaker 1: And even then it doesn't go up that much.

827
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,260
Speaker 1: Like this makes no sense.

828
01:00:08,361 --> 01:00:10,958
Speaker 1: Like there must be some reason the price of iron didn't go up.

829
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,757
Speaker 0: Well, there is one aspect of this game that I like in that I think this is part of what makes the game work.

830
01:00:17,522 --> 01:00:22,500
Speaker 0: The market, each of the resources are not just completely fungible, like they're just theme.

831
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:28,175
Speaker 0: They all are used for specific purposes and tend to have certain patterns.

832
01:00:28,215 --> 01:00:34,420
Speaker 0: like raw metal, like aluminum iron will never become super valuable in any circumstances.

833
01:00:34,860 --> 01:00:36,234
Speaker 1: But it stayed at like way low.

834
01:00:36,840 --> 01:00:38,259
Speaker 1: It didn't even go up to like 20 bucks.

835
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:43,320
Speaker 0: That implies that the other players, the AIs were not buying much iron from the market.

836
01:00:43,993 --> 01:00:44,180
Speaker 1: Right.

837
01:00:44,261 --> 01:00:45,860
Speaker 1: But there are also situations, right?

838
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,739
Speaker 1: So there's the colony, which is not a player.

839
01:00:48,020 --> 01:00:50,059
Speaker 1: It's just a thing on the map that you can look at.

840
01:00:50,201 --> 01:00:52,159
Speaker 1: And you know, it's what you're always buying and selling with.

841
01:00:52,801 --> 01:00:58,800
Speaker 1: And I saw that the colony had a lot of laboratories, which implies that, you know, those laboratories need chemicals to operate.

842
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:04,419
Speaker 1: And I said, aha, that library has a lot of chemicals needs with all its laboratories of the science colony.

843
01:01:05,063 --> 01:01:06,420
Speaker 1: I'll build some chemical plants.

844
01:01:07,066 --> 01:01:07,298
Speaker 1: Right.

845
01:01:07,781 --> 01:01:10,580
Speaker 1: And at the time I built them, they were somewhat profitable.

846
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:15,860
Speaker 1: And then fucking the chemical prices were just like in the shitter.

847
01:01:16,020 --> 01:01:17,720
Speaker 1: And I'm like, demand is so high.

848
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:19,200
Speaker 1: And I don't see a lot.

849
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:20,499
Speaker 1: I looked at the other players' bases.

850
01:01:20,642 --> 01:01:21,440
Speaker 1: They weren't making.

851
01:01:21,900 --> 01:01:24,380
Speaker 1: I think one other player had like one chemical plant.

852
01:01:24,500 --> 01:01:27,819
Speaker 1: And it's like, shouldn't the price of chemicals be going up?

853
01:01:28,500 --> 01:01:30,285
Speaker 1: It's like what it's like.

854
01:01:30,506 --> 01:01:37,400
Speaker 1: those common sense heuristics of supply and demand did not apply in several games that I played.

855
01:01:37,461 --> 01:01:38,619
Speaker 1: It was like a common pattern.

856
01:01:39,081 --> 01:01:44,720
Speaker 1: So I need I'm having trouble finding a heuristic of trying to predict what's going to be valuable.

857
01:01:45,260 --> 01:01:58,140
Speaker 0: I know this isn't helpful, but I look at that market the whole time and I kind of treat it like it's the real stock market, the way I would actually invest were I trying to invest in the commodities.

858
01:01:58,714 --> 01:01:58,840
Speaker 1: Right.

859
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:08,560
Speaker 1: But I mean, that's that that's one way to play is just, you know, like day trading or like, you know, real time trading where like it's like the prices up, sell, sell, sell the prices down, buy, buy, buy constantly.

860
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:19,339
Speaker 0: But I can't find any long term thinking to apply to the only long term thinking I have is chips always become valuable near the end.

861
01:02:19,820 --> 01:02:23,039
Speaker 0: Food almost always becomes very valuable near the end.

862
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,800
Speaker 0: Fuel is usually more expensive than I expected.

863
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:30,899
Speaker 0: And power is the thing that will fuck me over really badly if I don't pay attention to it.

864
01:02:31,594 --> 01:02:31,760
Speaker 1: Right.

865
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:33,086
Speaker 1: But it's like I try to.

866
01:02:33,247 --> 01:02:37,446
Speaker 1: I was, you know, in my attempts to find a long term thing, we're like, aha, I can.

867
01:02:37,687 --> 01:02:40,720
Speaker 1: I can predict in this game that this will be valuable later.

868
01:02:41,241 --> 01:02:46,839
Speaker 1: I'll stockpile it early and then make a big move because there's no other supply of it or something like that.

869
01:02:46,941 --> 01:02:48,138
Speaker 1: And that never worked ever.

870
01:02:48,662 --> 01:02:54,919
Speaker 0: Ah, that was one of the multiplayer games with iron for me because I had the hacker array just boost iron like ten times in a row.

871
01:02:55,220 --> 01:02:57,119
Speaker 1: I tried to do I've tried to do that and it didn't work.

872
01:02:58,625 --> 01:03:00,840
Speaker 0: So anyway, the danger is the hacker.

873
01:03:01,101 --> 01:03:07,019
Speaker 1: I think that there's a lot more focus on that sort of, you know, instant reaction of.

874
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:07,779
Speaker 1: look at the market.

875
01:03:07,961 --> 01:03:08,999
Speaker 1: A number goes green.

876
01:03:09,280 --> 01:03:10,200
Speaker 1: Do you have that resource?

877
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,140
Speaker 1: Start selling.

878
01:03:11,244 --> 01:03:11,457
Speaker 1: Yeah.

879
01:03:12,105 --> 01:03:13,039
Speaker 1: A number is red.

880
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:14,640
Speaker 1: Do you not have that resource?

881
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:18,860
Speaker 1: You know, start buying that sort of if it's a resource you need.

882
01:03:19,130 --> 01:03:19,279
Speaker 1: Yeah.

883
01:03:19,622 --> 01:03:20,719
Speaker 1: Or going to need so.

884
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:25,440
Speaker 0: But I really enjoy this game more so than I expected.

885
01:03:26,122 --> 01:03:33,500
Speaker 1: And the multiplayer game with such high quality of life with, you know, with less micro than other artists, but still an artist.

886
01:03:34,640 --> 01:03:46,700
Speaker 1: And, you know, with despite being so simple, relatively in terms of like what you can do, but having clearly a lot of strategic depth to get better at it in a high skill cap of some kind.

887
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:49,198
Speaker 1: You know, there's a lot of replay value here.

888
01:03:49,529 --> 01:03:49,678
Speaker 0: Yep.

889
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:54,840
Speaker 0: And if you you might encounter that the eyes are extremely unfun to play against.

890
01:03:55,003 --> 01:03:55,899
Speaker 0: Don't worry about that.

891
01:03:56,681 --> 01:04:04,639
Speaker 0: If you invest the five to 10 hours and just learning the basics of the game, multiplayer against scrubs is super fun.

892
01:04:05,181 --> 01:04:07,540
Speaker 0: Like we were playing for player multiplayer.

893
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:08,559
Speaker 0: None of us are that good.

894
01:04:08,943 --> 01:04:10,820
Speaker 0: And the games were really close and interesting.

895
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:15,100
Speaker 0: Kind of like when you play a euro style board game, but none of you have played it before.

896
01:04:15,180 --> 01:04:16,800
Speaker 0: And you're all just kind of fumbling in the dark.

897
01:04:17,563 --> 01:04:19,919
Speaker 0: It can be real fun and real fair and real close.

898
01:04:20,703 --> 01:04:25,440
Speaker 1: The one thing I really didn't like about this game is the single player campaign.

899
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:29,747
Speaker 1: You can do a single player skirmish, which is basically just play a multiplayer game against A.I.

900
01:04:30,151 --> 01:04:31,020
Speaker 1: to learn your shit.

901
01:04:31,581 --> 01:04:36,200
Speaker 1: But there's a campaign and the campaign is really all these scenarios.

902
01:04:36,560 --> 01:04:40,180
Speaker 1: And like you unlock and you don't even have all the buildings to start with.

903
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,675
Speaker 1: Like you're unlocking them as you go along.

904
01:04:42,622 --> 01:04:43,820
Speaker 1: And it's sort of stateful.

905
01:04:44,241 --> 01:04:50,160
Speaker 1: It's not bad, but like it was not as fun as just playing the normal game.

906
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:56,040
Speaker 0: It's kind of like remember there's the Wesnoth campaigns, but just Wesnoth multiplayer was like the thing that was worth playing.

907
01:04:56,460 --> 01:04:57,540
Speaker 1: Exactly, exactly.

908
01:04:57,861 --> 01:05:02,560
Speaker 1: So I could see someone getting into the campaign thing and enjoying it, but not me.

909
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,200
Speaker 0: Especially because one thing that's worth noting, the music is fantastic.

910
01:05:06,601 --> 01:05:08,180
Speaker 0: Like the theme is fantastic.

911
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:10,960
Speaker 0: This like corporate libertarian health game.

912
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,100
Speaker 1: The music is good, but I had to turn it off because it was too distracting.

913
01:05:14,801 --> 01:05:16,179
Speaker 0: I just turned it way down.

914
01:05:17,321 --> 01:05:18,377
Speaker 1: Down works good.

915
01:05:18,740 --> 01:05:20,959
Speaker 0: The writing is really funny.

916
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:24,540
Speaker 0: Especially, like not just the regular game, like the writing is funny.

917
01:05:24,660 --> 01:05:26,880
Speaker 0: Like when things happen, like when a pleasure dome gets built.

918
01:05:27,140 --> 01:05:33,280
Speaker 0: But the tutorials are, they're not as funny as Portal, but they're close.

919
01:05:34,564 --> 01:05:36,500
Speaker 0: There are jokes and little bits.

920
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:43,260
Speaker 1: It's that same sort of like tug and cheek, you know, sort of, what's it called?

921
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:46,280
Speaker 1: Hitchhiker's Guide-esque nerd humor, right?

922
01:05:46,560 --> 01:05:50,060
Speaker 1: Where it's being cute and cartoony and sciency.

923
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:53,860
Speaker 0: But also being a little bit like, yeah, libertarian dystopia.

924
01:05:53,940 --> 01:05:55,109
Speaker 0: This is what it looks like.

925
01:05:55,149 --> 01:05:55,754
Speaker 0: This is awful.

926
01:05:55,855 --> 01:05:56,500
Speaker 0: Fuck capitalism.

927
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:58,179
Speaker 1: Yep, exactly.

928
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,070
Speaker 0: The game is very much like capitalism.

929
01:06:00,131 --> 01:06:01,440
Speaker 0: in its final form is awful.

930
01:06:03,241 --> 01:06:04,124
Speaker 1: There's some M.U.L.E.

931
01:06:04,164 --> 01:06:07,860
Speaker 1: references that are not at all veiled in any way whatsoever.

932
01:06:08,241 --> 01:06:09,112
Speaker 0: There's just M.U.L.E.

933
01:06:09,152 --> 01:06:09,800
Speaker 0: on the black market.

934
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:12,480
Speaker 0: You can just buy it and it goes out and gets resources from the desert.

935
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:14,650
Speaker 1: And the tutorial references like Dr.

936
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:18,179
Speaker 1: Bunten, the creator of M.U.L.E It's like by name.

937
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:24,520
Speaker 0: I think this game is just, like, it has great reviews from a lot of people.

938
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:26,420
Speaker 0: It's not talked about that often.

939
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,278
Speaker 0: It wasn't talked about that much even when it came out.

940
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:30,440
Speaker 1: Well, it's a very niche interest, right?

941
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:30,778
Speaker 1: It is.

942
01:06:31,642 --> 01:06:34,779
Speaker 1: Even perfectly implemented, if I had nothing to complain about.

943
01:06:35,762 --> 01:06:38,360
Speaker 1: Who in the world is the audience for this game?

944
01:06:38,661 --> 01:06:39,838
Speaker 1: It's like nerds like us.

945
01:06:40,460 --> 01:06:41,317
Speaker 1: It's pretty much it.

946
01:06:42,680 --> 01:06:48,960
Speaker 0: And it's interesting that a game that was basically designed for me as a primary demographic is also a game that I'm terrible at.

947
01:06:49,741 --> 01:06:50,898
Speaker 1: I'm so awful at this game.

948
01:06:51,240 --> 01:06:52,959
Speaker 0: Yet I want to play it more.

949
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,740
Speaker 0: So if you listen to Geek Nights, there's a chance you will like this game.

950
01:06:58,182 --> 01:07:02,219
Speaker 0: And I'm pretty sure you can still try it out for free on the Epic Games Store if you want to try it.

951
01:07:04,143 --> 01:07:05,307
Speaker 1: Or just wait for a sale.

952
01:07:05,448 --> 01:07:08,260
Speaker 1: It will be on sale again for very little money.

953
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,660
