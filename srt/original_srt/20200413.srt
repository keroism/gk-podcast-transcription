1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:11,283
Speaker 0: It's Monday April 13th 2020.

2
00:00:11,283 --> 00:00:11,685
Speaker 0: I'm rim.

3
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:14,595
Speaker 0: I'm Scott and this is geek nights tonight.

4
00:00:14,876 --> 00:00:20,920
Speaker 0: We are talking about Postgres or Postgres QL the database you should probably be using.

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:24,118
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

6
00:00:27,267 --> 00:00:29,813
Speaker 0: So I've been live streaming myself playing DDR.

7
00:00:29,993 --> 00:00:32,619
Speaker 0: I've done it a few times now and I find anyone watching that.

8
00:00:32,819 --> 00:00:34,425
Speaker 0: yeah But interesting.

9
00:00:34,847 --> 00:00:38,180
Speaker 0: well, some people come in to not particularly good.

10
00:00:39,845 --> 00:00:49,820
Speaker 1: Good, I mean, you know, you're in the same zone that we're both at with most video games Which is better than most people but not remotely good as the really good people.

11
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:51,206
Speaker 1: So we're you know, it's like you could.

12
00:00:51,267 --> 00:00:54,060
Speaker 1: those people are like interesting to watch because of their amazing.

13
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,805
Speaker 0: Well, one thing I've noticed is that I was looking around at other people who are live streaming DDR and there aren't many Because it's kind of hard to do.

14
00:01:00,845 --> 00:01:06,600
Speaker 0: well most of the DDR streams have a decent number of viewers But like they look like garbage.

15
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:12,960
Speaker 0: They're like super out of sync or like the audio sounds really bad or it's like a webcam in a dark room pointed.

16
00:01:13,020 --> 00:01:16,038
Speaker 1: Oh the best DDR videos are recorded videos, right?

17
00:01:16,098 --> 00:01:21,474
Speaker 0: Not Yep, but like people just like live streaming like hey, I'm playing fourth mix right now tune in.

18
00:01:21,775 --> 00:01:22,737
Speaker 0: They're just all pretty bad.

19
00:01:23,038 --> 00:01:37,147
Speaker 0: But also Most of the streams I found are people who are either on an arcade machine holding on to the bar Even if they're really good or they've made a fucking bar for their home pad and they're holding on to that Mm-hmm.

20
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:39,580
Speaker 0: So because I'm doing bar lists, I got a few viewers.

21
00:01:39,703 --> 00:01:40,239
Speaker 0: It's pretty fun.

22
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:46,102
Speaker 0: But the most fun thing is getting random requests like I do max 300 because I can pass most of the weird shit people try To make me do.

23
00:01:46,664 --> 00:01:49,974
Speaker 0: but I am definitely too old to ever pass max 300 again.

24
00:01:49,994 --> 00:01:51,760
Speaker 1: Holy shit if you use the bar.

25
00:01:52,641 --> 00:02:02,769
Speaker 0: Well, the bar doesn't help me because I just I can walk around the pad and I can pass max 300 if I do The first half and the second half separately.

26
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:09,979
Speaker 0: I am too old to do the whole song in one go My legs just run out of steam and I just fall over about two-thirds of the way through it.

27
00:02:10,562 --> 00:02:12,169
Speaker 1: I think this harder songs in that now.

28
00:02:12,330 --> 00:02:14,740
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there's Legend of Max, which I can get about halfway through.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,680
Speaker 1: I'm saying this even harder songs in that there've been so many DDR versions.

30
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,540
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, there's max though what we would consider a nine-footer from the old days if they change the foot system.

31
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:30,512
Speaker 0: But there's basically the equivalent of like 15 footers now Mmm, but they're not fun to watch anyone do it's just fanboy piston.

32
00:02:31,335 --> 00:02:43,931
Speaker 0: Yeah, but Getting the stream synced to where the two cameras pointed at my at me and my feet plus the audio plus step mania getting those all in sync the fucking nightmare.

33
00:02:43,971 --> 00:02:57,600
Speaker 1: because there is no good synchronization tools for Non-professional video equipment like good best synchronization that I found for someone Streaming a recording stuff at home is to simply send the audio through one of the cameras.

34
00:02:57,600 --> 00:03:00,271
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if you have multiple cameras, you got to sync those.

35
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,704
Speaker 1: but yeah, you definitely well at multiple cameras You would simply have.

36
00:03:03,764 --> 00:03:08,260
Speaker 1: hopefully the primary best camera would be the one with the audio going through it.

37
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,260
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and if you switch to a different camera, well then that one's out of sync.

38
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:17,939
Speaker 0: But I don't have a good way to plug my real fancy camera in to OBS.

39
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:21,655
Speaker 0: yet Cuz I don't have a good video capture card, but I think I said the one that I sent you there.

40
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,080
Speaker 0: I'm gonna buy one of those janky bootleg looking RTMP encoders and just stick it on my camcorder.

41
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:30,088
Speaker 1: Well, oh well that yeah, that's for that.

42
00:03:30,128 --> 00:03:32,277
Speaker 1: But you know cuz then I can use it if that works.

43
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:41,296
Speaker 0: I want one also Yeah I'm gonna get like a cheapo one cuz from what I can tell the cheap ones Are kind of dodgy and probably are not paying for the right licenses for their like whatever codex they have.

44
00:03:41,337 --> 00:03:47,715
Speaker 1: the cheap one was - it Was less $200 or less and the one that actually looked like totally legit.

45
00:03:47,755 --> 00:03:49,983
Speaker 1: Super good was close to like $1,700.

46
00:03:49,983 --> 00:03:53,980
Speaker 1: so it's like this and there weren't a lot of products on the market.

47
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:58,059
Speaker 0: So if I break one every six months, it's still cheaper to get the crappy one.

48
00:03:58,923 --> 00:04:06,131
Speaker 0: because it seems like the primary problem with the crappy ones is they'll just randomly break or die and they're kind of Even the Cerevo live shell X.

49
00:04:06,231 --> 00:04:14,017
Speaker 1: I saw people complaining that Sometimes their cloud service is down at some time and some battery that's in it is not great.

50
00:04:14,298 --> 00:04:14,780
Speaker 0: That's the thing.

51
00:04:14,881 --> 00:04:19,244
Speaker 0: It's like some domains like when I buy audio equipment Like there are.

52
00:04:19,363 --> 00:04:24,740
Speaker 0: if the pro versions the reason why they cost so much is that they just work like they just work.

53
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:25,724
Speaker 0: You don't have to worry about it.

54
00:04:25,744 --> 00:04:26,407
Speaker 0: The support is great.

55
00:04:26,427 --> 00:04:29,760
Speaker 1: But the problem is those pro ones do so much more stuff.

56
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:33,235
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't need like four-way cell bonding right that we don't need.

57
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,762
Speaker 1: I wish the pro one It's like.

58
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:40,044
Speaker 1: all we need is a device that takes HDMI in as HDMI outs.

59
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:46,220
Speaker 1: it's that for for you know connecting to like a monitor or right remove HTTP just in case.

60
00:04:47,142 --> 00:05:01,500
Speaker 1: Sure, it needs to take whatever video is on that HDMI and then encode it and send it via Wi-Fi Or Ethernet to an arbitrary RTMP destination to an arbitrary RTMP URL at 1080p 60.

61
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,504
Speaker 1: That's all it has to do.

62
00:05:02,624 --> 00:05:03,888
Speaker 1: It doesn't need any other feature.

63
00:05:04,209 --> 00:05:12,832
Speaker 1: The only configuration should be the Wi-Fi connection right SSID and info for that and the RTMP URL.

64
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:15,905
Speaker 0: yeah and RTMP authentication like.

65
00:05:15,925 --> 00:05:19,880
Speaker 0: I don't even care if like the color is bad or really anything.

66
00:05:20,847 --> 00:05:30,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, no I mean People were actually complaining that like the live shell X the color is bad Like it doesn't get to white it only gets to gray and it doesn't get to black.

67
00:05:30,461 --> 00:05:33,060
Speaker 1: It only gets to dark gray, but see that's what I'm talking about.

68
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,680
Speaker 0: It's one thing if there's a really expensive version, but it is perfect and just works.

69
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:41,954
Speaker 0: But it's just way too expensive if the expensive option also has people complaining about it.

70
00:05:42,255 --> 00:05:43,580
Speaker 0: That space is not mature yet.

71
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,502
Speaker 1: That wasn't the XP.

72
00:05:44,562 --> 00:05:48,052
Speaker 1: alive shell X is 700. the 1700 that that won $1,000 more is the one that has no problem.

73
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:53,607
Speaker 0: Yep At least I had described.

74
00:05:53,889 --> 00:05:56,640
Speaker 0: I restrained myself from buying as I need to do monitor speakers.

75
00:05:57,165 --> 00:06:03,260
Speaker 0: I got the ones that were Appropriate to the size of this room as opposed to the ones that I wanted to get.

76
00:06:04,803 --> 00:06:13,520
Speaker 1: Well, I mean, yeah, there's definitely you know You look at the market for any sort of electronic stuff and there's always things that are made for houses and large rooms big TV.

77
00:06:14,604 --> 00:06:15,730
Speaker 1: You know all this kind of stuff.

78
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:23,660
Speaker 1: and when you live in a tiny apartment, you know Even though those products are awesome when in a vacuum, they're not awesome in a tiny room without a lot of space.

79
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:29,254
Speaker 0: So I saved $300 by having 50 total watts of output power in this tiny room instead of 250 watts.

80
00:06:29,274 --> 00:06:33,438
Speaker 0: Yep So I got any news.

81
00:06:34,681 --> 00:06:35,865
Speaker 1: Do I have news all this?

82
00:06:35,926 --> 00:06:49,846
Speaker 1: the first of all is you know, I guess virus ish related news you may have seen this is that various states are looking for COBOL programmers because There's a lot of unemployment right now.

83
00:06:49,866 --> 00:06:55,747
Speaker 1: Yeah, and all the unemployment systems are written in COBOL And you're thinking well, okay.

84
00:06:55,827 --> 00:06:59,800
Speaker 1: First of all, you know, we need to talk about why it's still they haven't replaced that system.

85
00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:06,292
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a lot while there's a lot mostly bad reasons why there are Surprisingly good reasons in some cases.

86
00:07:06,694 --> 00:07:12,150
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah plenty of good reasons but the Fact is those are still the systems in use.

87
00:07:12,511 --> 00:07:18,610
Speaker 1: people go to work and they're looking at some cruddy old terminal Connecting to this old database that still works and still gets the job done.

88
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:23,505
Speaker 1: and still people get their unemployment checks and you think well Why do they need programmers?

89
00:07:23,565 --> 00:07:25,051
Speaker 1: this this system has been there?

90
00:07:25,132 --> 00:07:25,654
Speaker 1: It's working.

91
00:07:25,694 --> 00:07:26,156
Speaker 1: It's working.

92
00:07:26,216 --> 00:07:29,165
Speaker 1: So well since 1960 who knows how old the?

93
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:37,551
Speaker 0: but there were more unemployment claims in the last like two weeks than in like Entire quarters in recent year, but it's not about the probe.

94
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:40,760
Speaker 1: You don't need programming to increase the capacity necessarily.

95
00:07:41,447 --> 00:07:42,539
Speaker 1: Why do you need?

96
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:46,299
Speaker 1: programming Because they change the law.

97
00:07:46,823 --> 00:08:02,539
Speaker 1: That's why right the law Goes from some legislators hands they vote on it and when they change unemployment law Say to give everyone an extra six hundred dollars You have to change the code in the kobolds isn't to match the law.

98
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:14,639
Speaker 0: now That is an area where I actually have a lot of expertise because as you know My day job is in capital markets and capital markets have extreme Regulations in some cases.

99
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:33,438
Speaker 0: So like a law will happen and then an entire global industry has to implement that law in code Within like a couple years, but unlike every other sector in the entire global economy Capital markets has a shit ton of engineering resources available and they just do it.

100
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:48,760
Speaker 0: But even then it's a pain because laws are written in a way that is not necessarily that easy to transform into code Mm-hmm, but outside of capital markets you can't just hire like a hundred three hundred thousand dollar a year engineers to solve this problem.

101
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,079
Speaker 0: You don't have enough money to do that.

102
00:08:50,828 --> 00:09:03,098
Speaker 1: Right, you might be thinking well You could find a kobold guy to figure out this old not only to know kobold but to figure out this old busted system and Update it without breaking it right and get it to get the law changes in there.

103
00:09:03,158 --> 00:09:06,399
Speaker 1: Yeah, right It's like okay, you could do that, which is what you're gonna do.

104
00:09:07,143 --> 00:09:10,240
Speaker 1: It's like well, why not just rewrite the whole thing and some modern thing?

105
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:10,681
Speaker 1: Okay.

106
00:09:11,023 --> 00:09:16,569
Speaker 1: Well the even if you were gonna pay people to do that, you're like, okay Let's do the right thing and replace this old credit system.

107
00:09:16,951 --> 00:09:23,910
Speaker 1: Right the you have to a how much Institutional knowledge is in that old code.

108
00:09:24,371 --> 00:09:31,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, right that old system is calculating Things correctly, right regardless of how busted it is.

109
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:32,573
Speaker 1: It's doing it, right?

110
00:09:33,195 --> 00:09:39,538
Speaker 1: So you need to build a system and Based on it just knowledge that people have that you can talk to.

111
00:09:39,558 --> 00:09:39,658
Speaker 1: right.

112
00:09:40,761 --> 00:09:48,799
Speaker 1: they might not be able to explain things to you they might forget things things they say might be wrong and The the system is right.

113
00:09:49,482 --> 00:09:58,013
Speaker 1: You have to match you to reverse engineer every single edge case in that old system To make your system correct even worse.

114
00:09:58,254 --> 00:10:08,051
Speaker 1: you have to that process Alone, right will take you so long That you'll still be using the cobalt one for years and even worse.

115
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:17,668
Speaker 0: all that aside the old systems are more like normal engineering Which is something that most software does not follow.

116
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:22,742
Speaker 0: like the bet the practices of real engineering is not something that most code in the world Follows.

117
00:10:23,063 --> 00:10:25,832
Speaker 0: that's why code has a lot of bugs and a lot of issues.

118
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:37,609
Speaker 0: software like this cannot have bugs You cannot just use like the kinds of frameworks and the kinds of data structures and the kinds of validations That most programmers use in most code that they write.

119
00:10:37,850 --> 00:10:38,352
Speaker 0: you have to write.

120
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:45,333
Speaker 1: you say that but from what I've heard most of These old cobalt systems for this kind of thing are just spaghetti code.

121
00:10:45,373 --> 00:10:50,651
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it's often spaghetti code that will have Like multiple verification paths.

122
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:52,158
Speaker 0: the problem is it'll be three spaghetti.

123
00:10:52,198 --> 00:10:59,527
Speaker 0: It's correct It's correct spaghetti code, but it's it's not good, but they tend to have multiple paths of verification Which is something that it's not.

124
00:10:59,547 --> 00:11:00,069
Speaker 1: that I mean.

125
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:05,417
Speaker 1: you might get that with code for like space shuttles Yeah, medical devices, but not for unemployment systems.

126
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:20,080
Speaker 0: Yeah systems right But it's also sort of a more broader picture that I've realized more and more as the scale of what I do during my day Job increases and like the number of systems and like these things I interact with have just grown over the years.

127
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:28,040
Speaker 0: but one thing that's really become abundantly clear is that Enterprise doesn't just mean shitty interfaces and garbage software.

128
00:11:28,141 --> 00:11:30,400
Speaker 0: I mean that that is a big part of the word enterprise.

129
00:11:30,881 --> 00:11:33,309
Speaker 0: but enterprise also really like this is enterprise.

130
00:11:33,369 --> 00:11:48,693
Speaker 0: enterprise means that you're writing software or code or Systems that work on a scale that is beyond what 99.9 percent of all people will ever interact with Just the number of stakeholders number of users the use cases the constraints.

131
00:11:48,773 --> 00:11:51,040
Speaker 0: like it's a it's a totally different discipline.

132
00:11:51,321 --> 00:12:05,265
Speaker 0: it's almost like there's a kid there's a computer science discipline and a software engineering discipline and you almost need like a Scaled software engineering discipline that follows a different path through schooling and education Hmm.

133
00:12:05,285 --> 00:12:08,496
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the system that we've been replacing at my work for the past.

134
00:12:08,536 --> 00:12:09,279
Speaker 1: However long.

135
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:09,942
Speaker 1: Yeah I still haven't.

136
00:12:10,243 --> 00:12:10,966
Speaker 1: we're you know, we're get.

137
00:12:11,046 --> 00:12:11,187
Speaker 1: it's.

138
00:12:11,387 --> 00:12:12,773
Speaker 1: it's not nearly as complicated.

139
00:12:12,813 --> 00:12:13,435
Speaker 1: I'm sure right.

140
00:12:13,455 --> 00:12:14,600
Speaker 1: We're making a lot of progress.

141
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:22,510
Speaker 1: we are gonna replace it and but the reason that it's a good idea is because a The old system is actually not COBOL.

142
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:24,676
Speaker 1: It's like Microsoft SQL servers.

143
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:25,318
Speaker 0: Oh god.

144
00:12:25,338 --> 00:12:30,980
Speaker 0: Oh god Is there just like database trigger like stored procedures in there all kinds of garbage like that?

145
00:12:32,082 --> 00:12:33,729
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you want to give me a thousand less.

146
00:12:33,929 --> 00:12:38,264
Speaker 0: say the word stored procedure with with business logic in it It's less awful than COBOL.

147
00:12:38,304 --> 00:12:41,171
Speaker 1: So it's like we can sort of you know, figure it out.

148
00:12:41,492 --> 00:12:51,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, the other thing is that unlike the Unemployment system situation right the system we're replacing is actually often wrong, right?

149
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,386
Speaker 1: So it's not a matter.

150
00:12:52,607 --> 00:12:53,995
Speaker 1: It's not a matter of this.

151
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:54,800
Speaker 1: thing is right.

152
00:12:54,961 --> 00:12:55,624
Speaker 1: It's a matter of.

153
00:12:55,644 --> 00:12:57,634
Speaker 1: this is the thing everyone uses.

154
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:58,619
Speaker 1: it's right enough.

155
00:12:59,382 --> 00:13:02,012
Speaker 1: We cannot write by replacing it.

156
00:13:02,092 --> 00:13:04,260
Speaker 1: Not only are we fixing all of its flaws?

157
00:13:04,961 --> 00:13:05,484
Speaker 1: But we're gonna.

158
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,739
Speaker 1: we have the opportunity to do better, right?

159
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:13,457
Speaker 1: So with you don't have that opportunity with these COBOL systems to do better than them.

160
00:13:13,678 --> 00:13:19,058
Speaker 1: Yep, right As much there isn't that much room and there isn't like some motive for doing better.

161
00:13:19,219 --> 00:13:19,480
Speaker 1: Really?

162
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:23,837
Speaker 0: Yeah the cost of a lift and shift of this kind of thing is your hope.

163
00:13:23,857 --> 00:13:27,332
Speaker 1: like your hope for the Unemployment system is to never have to is to like.

164
00:13:27,372 --> 00:13:31,129
Speaker 1: the goal is for it to go away What no one's unemployed like.

165
00:13:31,169 --> 00:13:43,880
Speaker 0: whatever you out there if you don't work in enterprise scale Like whatever you think it would cost to do this kind of thing within one firm Raise it by an order of magnitude and then double it and that's probably a low-end estimate of the actual real cost.

166
00:13:44,402 --> 00:13:46,810
Speaker 1: Yeah, but I don't recommend you learn COBOL.

167
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:47,512
Speaker 1: No, no, no.

168
00:13:47,873 --> 00:13:58,090
Speaker 1: the one time I heard of someone replacing an old system was someone who worked at an big insurance company in the city that had an old busted system.

169
00:13:58,651 --> 00:14:06,811
Speaker 1: and the way that they were escaping that system is They were screen reading from a terminals to get the data out.

170
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:07,252
Speaker 1: Whoo.

171
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:10,020
Speaker 0: I've done I've implemented things like that before, right?

172
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:16,904
Speaker 1: So they were like, you know using a virtual terminal protocol to connect Right to the system Right inter.

173
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:28,579
Speaker 1: basically the new system was interacting with the old system as a user would because it's not like the old system has an Ethernet Port right exactly and then they were getting the data out that way, right?

174
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:36,360
Speaker 1: So that you know and that required basically almost no knowledge of the old system other than how to use a terminal.

175
00:14:36,621 --> 00:14:37,244
Speaker 1: Yep, right.

176
00:14:37,364 --> 00:14:38,850
Speaker 0: COBOL is definitely on its way out.

177
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:43,950
Speaker 0: But in general like my career too like here's a fun example I'm one of the global experts in the fixed protocol.

178
00:14:44,011 --> 00:14:46,159
Speaker 0: It's some old busted stuff, but people need it.

179
00:14:46,722 --> 00:14:54,530
Speaker 0: You will never go wrong by learning and becoming the expert in Old boring weird bullshit that nobody wants to deal with.

180
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,334
Speaker 1: because well by that we don't.

181
00:14:56,475 --> 00:15:09,000
Speaker 1: I don't necessarily mean a language like COBOL But with some old boring weird shit would be like a specific You know Technology or product like that has to be something that's actually used in an industry.

182
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:10,705
Speaker 0: Yeah, like knowing COBOL is not the important part.

183
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:15,200
Speaker 0: understanding how systems like this work is the hard part, right?

184
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:23,344
Speaker 1: So for example, like there's some specialized product that everyone in industry X uses to do a particular thing in the world Right.

185
00:15:23,886 --> 00:15:26,335
Speaker 1: It's like oh there are people trading.

186
00:15:26,436 --> 00:15:27,600
Speaker 1: I don't know commodities, right?

187
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:30,617
Speaker 1: All the commodities traders probably have a thing that they use.

188
00:15:30,718 --> 00:15:33,108
Speaker 1: Yeah That's like the commodities trading thing.

189
00:15:33,268 --> 00:15:40,153
Speaker 0: learn that if you sing and either if you become the master of that thing You're good You don't even need to be a programmer you just be a BA like a business analyst.

190
00:15:40,173 --> 00:15:52,769
Speaker 0: if there are people who make as much Money as me and Scott and then write any code their sole job is to understand explain and document complex systems based on Research and their own just knowledge and intelligence.

191
00:15:52,789 --> 00:15:53,351
Speaker 1: Well, that's also.

192
00:15:53,371 --> 00:15:55,720
Speaker 1: a large part of the problem is these old COBOL systems.

193
00:15:55,961 --> 00:16:01,032
Speaker 1: They were like I said spaghetti code But also not documented from a developer standpoint.

194
00:16:01,153 --> 00:16:09,080
Speaker 1: if they're right if there's any documentation Which there probably isn't it's from a user standpoint like how to use right like you have to enter someone's claim.

195
00:16:09,221 --> 00:16:10,026
Speaker 1: Here's how to do it.

196
00:16:10,127 --> 00:16:10,368
Speaker 1: Right?

197
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:12,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what's going on behind the scenes?

198
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,846
Speaker 0: Mysteries mysteries.

199
00:16:14,329 --> 00:16:16,340
Speaker 0: So in some other news, that's very sad and tragic.

200
00:16:16,481 --> 00:16:18,509
Speaker 0: I knew he died and I felt bad about it because he was.

201
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:23,250
Speaker 0: he was like over 80 like he was old I at one point years ago.

202
00:16:23,290 --> 00:16:47,153
Speaker 0: I was surprised he was still alive, but COVID-19 claimed the life of John Conway who is what a very very important person when it comes to computer science and other fields Mm-hmm, John Conway also like not that I knew him or anything but you know Sometimes there's a an important person who's also a dick or has problems as far as I can tell John Conway seemed like mostly a really cool person.

203
00:16:48,461 --> 00:16:58,096
Speaker 1: Yeah, John Conway, basically, it's like, you know, it's like you everyone knows like the game of life But like the amount of things that he worked on that are like significant.

204
00:16:58,136 --> 00:17:00,688
Speaker 1: and it's like oh that thing The Guardian.

205
00:17:00,728 --> 00:17:04,204
Speaker 0: I found a quote here the Guardian in his Basically the eulogy.

206
00:17:04,244 --> 00:17:08,599
Speaker 0: they said John Conway is a cross between Archimedes Mick Jagger and Salvador Dali.

207
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:10,491
Speaker 1: That's pretty much correct.

208
00:17:10,531 --> 00:17:17,480
Speaker 0: Yeah for many years He was worried that his obsession with playing silly games was ruining his career until he realized that it could lead to extraordinary discoveries.

209
00:17:18,946 --> 00:17:26,156
Speaker 0: so Pour one out for John Conway He's he's an important person and if you can find videos of his lectures and talks and just stuff he's done.

210
00:17:26,175 --> 00:17:27,380
Speaker 0: It's all fascinating.

211
00:17:28,104 --> 00:17:30,218
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm In some other news.

212
00:17:31,025 --> 00:17:33,140
Speaker 0: This is a Scott news, but it's up my alley.

213
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:33,501
Speaker 0: I didn't.

214
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:37,175
Speaker 0: I wasn't paying attention to this one because I don't set clocks anymore.

215
00:17:37,195 --> 00:17:38,440
Speaker 0: I have people to do that for me.

216
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:41,242
Speaker 0: I have not touched NTP in 3.2 years.

217
00:17:44,262 --> 00:17:52,763
Speaker 1: I'm not gonna get into the specifics of this because I'll be wrong and it's because it's about quantum mechanics And I'm reading this article right now So I'll see what I can.

218
00:17:53,484 --> 00:17:54,507
Speaker 1: but the basic.

219
00:17:54,527 --> 00:18:09,037
Speaker 1: the basic gist is that there's an atomic clock that works somehow by Quantum, you know check like charging a particle and then checking what charge level the electrons are add or something And it makes it makes a very very accurate clock.

220
00:18:10,182 --> 00:18:11,787
Speaker 0: But because okay, I'm reading this article.

221
00:18:11,827 --> 00:18:13,452
Speaker 0: This is what the fuck.

222
00:18:14,053 --> 00:18:23,360
Speaker 1: but because the clock works on you know such a Quantum level right it obeys the theory of relativity.

223
00:18:24,002 --> 00:18:29,520
Speaker 1: So if you make push if you pick up the clock and carry it away from the earth, right?

224
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:35,809
Speaker 1: It will on its own naturally Right speed up or slow down, right?

225
00:18:36,311 --> 00:18:37,675
Speaker 1: I guess all clocks do that.

226
00:18:37,735 --> 00:18:39,079
Speaker 1: Technically they see I'm already wrong.

227
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:42,148
Speaker 1: The point is the time is relative.

228
00:18:42,689 --> 00:18:51,043
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the point is that the clock is so precise Right that if you can use it as an altimeter Right.

229
00:18:51,404 --> 00:18:56,202
Speaker 0: So if you go to carry it a chanly induced frequency shift Right.

230
00:18:56,302 --> 00:19:03,260
Speaker 0: the frequency of this thing shifted by 21 hertz at a distance an elevation change of what?

231
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,482
Speaker 0: 450 meters.

232
00:19:04,823 --> 00:19:05,845
Speaker 1: what right fuck.

233
00:19:06,307 --> 00:19:15,669
Speaker 1: so you if you were to bring it up the Empire State Building you could theoretically tell how tall the Empire State Building is based on How much this clock is.

234
00:19:15,690 --> 00:19:16,614
Speaker 1: I don't know.

235
00:19:16,755 --> 00:19:17,779
Speaker 1: slow down or sped up.

236
00:19:18,201 --> 00:19:18,963
Speaker 0: The clock is.

237
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:24,219
Speaker 0: you can use this clock alone as an altimeter that's accurate to within 10 centimeters.

238
00:19:25,286 --> 00:19:26,212
Speaker 0: Look at your watch.

239
00:19:26,514 --> 00:19:32,139
Speaker 0: run up a building Look at your watch again and then be able to say just from what you saw on the watch how tall that building is.

240
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:39,978
Speaker 1: That's how much less how much less gravity there is up there than down here because there is less Right up there.

241
00:19:40,241 --> 00:19:42,138
Speaker 1: Yes, less gravity up there.

242
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:48,600
Speaker 0: Yeah, because the inverse square laws the further away you get from something the gravitational influence drops off rapidly.

243
00:19:49,104 --> 00:19:51,359
Speaker 0: However, it has never hit zero, right?

244
00:19:51,520 --> 00:20:03,000
Speaker 1: So normally the an atomic clock like this would be so valuable and so fragile that you would keep it in a room not move It connected to the internet so everyone could take advantage of its extra precise time.

245
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:07,499
Speaker 1: But yeah, they basically put it in several boxes in the back of a Honda Civic.

246
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:15,254
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah This is just cool stuff, uh, but yeah, I don't set clocks anymore.

247
00:20:15,635 --> 00:20:20,279
Speaker 1: NTP works fine, but If you did set a clock you'd set it against that one.

248
00:20:21,262 --> 00:20:24,544
Speaker 0: No, I would set it against a static Atomic clock.

249
00:20:24,604 --> 00:20:25,126
Speaker 0: I think still.

250
00:20:25,146 --> 00:20:28,280
Speaker 1: I know that one seems pretty good to me this one.

251
00:20:28,862 --> 00:20:35,083
Speaker 0: I got to read more about this thing because this article is more funny than directly informative, but this is cool Mm-hmm.

252
00:20:35,546 --> 00:20:35,908
Speaker 0: All right.

253
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:48,397
Speaker 0: So last but definitely not least One thing that the global pandemic has shown is that very few people have Reasonable solutions for doing like online meetings with more than like two people.

254
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:50,024
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean, you know, we.

255
00:20:50,747 --> 00:20:53,600
Speaker 1: I'm sure you've already read all about how zoom sucks, right?

256
00:20:53,840 --> 00:21:07,691
Speaker 1: But I want people don't seem to realize why did zoom become a big hit and it's because there were no other Products out there that were free Accessible to everyone on air on almost every platform.

257
00:21:08,353 --> 00:21:10,320
Speaker 1: that did exactly what it does.

258
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:15,340
Speaker 1: There are tons of video conferencing video chat solutions, right and most of them are better than zoom.

259
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:18,061
Speaker 1: But for example FaceTime FaceTime Which was?

260
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:19,725
Speaker 1: I'm still mad at Apple about this.

261
00:21:19,826 --> 00:21:28,270
Speaker 1: go back and watch the keynote where they announced FaceTime and said it would be an open Protocol that anyone could build FaceTime.

262
00:21:28,411 --> 00:21:33,571
Speaker 1: I thought there was going to be FaceTime on Windows And on everything Android everything and there wasn't.

263
00:21:33,993 --> 00:21:34,615
Speaker 1: there still isn't.

264
00:21:34,636 --> 00:21:35,580
Speaker 1: I would have used it.

265
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,688
Speaker 1: They straight out lied like the president.

266
00:21:37,808 --> 00:21:41,000
Speaker 1: they straight out lied, but FaceTime is the best video.

267
00:21:41,421 --> 00:21:43,871
Speaker 1: You know consumer video chat solution there is.

268
00:21:43,891 --> 00:21:46,380
Speaker 1: yeah, you can need an Apple device to use it, right?

269
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,564
Speaker 1: So that's right out right.

270
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:50,253
Speaker 1: so that can't beat zoom which runs on everything.

271
00:21:50,394 --> 00:21:54,809
Speaker 0: Yep, and there's a lot of great solutions But they're all enterprise II or cost money right?

272
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:58,040
Speaker 1: or even Google meet Google meet which my company uses.

273
00:21:58,162 --> 00:22:03,080
Speaker 1: You need to have a Google You know company account and all the people have to be on it.

274
00:22:03,401 --> 00:22:04,506
Speaker 1: You can use it at your company.

275
00:22:04,546 --> 00:22:07,900
Speaker 1: if your company uses Google, you know, Microsoft Teams or whatever.

276
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:10,349
Speaker 1: You got to have a company that uses Microsoft Teams.

277
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:12,959
Speaker 1: That's not something that someone at home can use with their friends.

278
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:19,040
Speaker 1: Zoom was also designed for companies to use to run little video chats, right?

279
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:22,210
Speaker 1: But it was free to try and set up.

280
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,800
Speaker 1: you can have a 40-minute chat for free or something like that.

281
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:33,156
Speaker 1: Then it times you out you start another one And Everyone get us download it for free use it for free and it did.

282
00:22:33,196 --> 00:22:37,131
Speaker 1: the grid display Right, the other chats did not do grid displays.

283
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:39,760
Speaker 1: They did, you know switch to whoever's talking.

284
00:22:40,242 --> 00:22:42,010
Speaker 1: I did all sorts of other, you know, you know.

285
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:48,659
Speaker 0: FaceTime does like a picture and picture, you know We use at work is proprietary like we paid a company to build it for us.

286
00:22:49,061 --> 00:22:56,394
Speaker 0: But it has a really good model where it'll line everyone up at the bottom But it'll only show like the ten or so recent people who talked.

287
00:22:56,755 --> 00:23:04,100
Speaker 0: but then some of Google does Yeah, and if anyone talks they come up in the big screen and then they kind of settled back into the array of people who?

288
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:04,803
Speaker 0: Recently talked.

289
00:23:04,823 --> 00:23:06,633
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's what most you know bit.

290
00:23:06,694 --> 00:23:16,400
Speaker 1: as for business cases That's what you want because in a business case, you know There's usually some people talking and a lot of people listening and maybe occasionally asking a question or chiming in.

291
00:23:16,902 --> 00:23:21,280
Speaker 1: But if you're chatting with all your friends, right you want this party atmosphere, right?

292
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:28,460
Speaker 1: The grid view is actually better for that social arrangement where even if someone doesn't talk you see their face always there.

293
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,553
Speaker 1: You you know, you feel like you're there with them.

294
00:23:30,594 --> 00:23:31,479
Speaker 1: you get their reactions.

295
00:23:31,801 --> 00:23:33,531
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, you know what they're up to.

296
00:23:33,591 --> 00:23:39,140
Speaker 1: you can see their environment, you know The business one that wouldn't be so great for that kind of kind of thing.

297
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:41,189
Speaker 1: You'd only ever see the chatty people like rim.

298
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:43,520
Speaker 1: Yeah other people you would be like were they even on the chat?

299
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,342
Speaker 1: I don't know.

300
00:23:44,843 --> 00:23:46,087
Speaker 1: you wouldn't feel that togetherness.

301
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,734
Speaker 1: So that is wise piece of shit.

302
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:52,286
Speaker 1: garbage zoom took over But obviously it sucks.

303
00:23:52,306 --> 00:23:54,414
Speaker 1: It has security issues privacy issues.

304
00:23:54,474 --> 00:23:57,963
Speaker 1: It's just a piece of shit really But there isn't anything else.

305
00:23:58,384 --> 00:24:03,157
Speaker 0: Well, there wasn't anything else until this update as of dateline today.

306
00:24:03,177 --> 00:24:08,350
Speaker 0: Oh Okay, so discord which not discord is not perfect.

307
00:24:08,531 --> 00:24:11,679
Speaker 0: However, I trust discord a lot more than I trust zoom.

308
00:24:13,042 --> 00:24:14,549
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I use discord low bar.

309
00:24:14,589 --> 00:24:21,940
Speaker 0: But yeah, but it's a low bar but like We are flying high above that bar with discord even though there's still our problems there.

310
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:28,080
Speaker 0: Like I want there to be more open solutions for this kind of thing, you know back when web 2.0 existed miss those days.

311
00:24:28,401 --> 00:24:31,172
Speaker 0: but anyway discord is right now.

312
00:24:31,513 --> 00:24:39,240
Speaker 0: they have rolled out a Feature that basically does all this stuff in five percent of discord servers out in the wild for free.

313
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:41,108
Speaker 0: It's just there and they're testing it.

314
00:24:41,128 --> 00:24:43,780
Speaker 0: They're gonna roll it out to everyone else on a schedule to be determined.

315
00:24:44,181 --> 00:24:44,984
Speaker 0: There's a fact here.

316
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:48,176
Speaker 0: I'm like literally just looking at this because it's brand new.

317
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:50,903
Speaker 0: it looks Basically, perfect.

318
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:54,695
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know, they were already positioned to build something.

319
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:55,277
Speaker 1: I was surprised.

320
00:24:55,297 --> 00:24:56,340
Speaker 1: They didn't have it already, right?

321
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,359
Speaker 1: They already do voice chat.

322
00:24:57,741 --> 00:25:02,056
Speaker 0: I already suspect they were already working on this and just hadn't rolled it out yet.

323
00:25:02,116 --> 00:25:03,160
Speaker 0: and then coronavirus happens.

324
00:25:03,664 --> 00:25:11,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, probably because I remember way back We were at a PAX and we were already Anxing about like we got to get off a Google Hangouts because we can't trust Google.

325
00:25:11,361 --> 00:25:15,460
Speaker 1: They're starting to like destroy all their services or it's not perfect, but I guess that's what we'll use for now.

326
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:22,988
Speaker 0: But I remember we talked to some discord people and they that was back when they were really trying to pitch like hey We exist check us out and they like.

327
00:25:23,249 --> 00:25:30,060
Speaker 0: they like in person really aggressively like yeah Forget your forget your forum put all your community in our discord.

328
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:30,823
Speaker 0: We'll help you out.

329
00:25:31,224 --> 00:25:34,836
Speaker 0: and we Scott was very like yeah, I don't trust you.

330
00:25:34,856 --> 00:25:36,080
Speaker 1: I don't trust them at all.

331
00:25:36,161 --> 00:25:37,069
Speaker 1: I still don't trust them.

332
00:25:37,109 --> 00:25:37,997
Speaker 1: Where are they making money?

333
00:25:39,101 --> 00:25:40,566
Speaker 0: Well, they make but what the thing is?

334
00:25:40,606 --> 00:25:43,295
Speaker 0: they do have a direct revenue stream.

335
00:25:44,058 --> 00:25:47,440
Speaker 1: the booth sure But yeah, but I don't think that makes them enough money to survive.

336
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,936
Speaker 1: I still think they're basically living on borrowed Silicon Valley time.

337
00:25:50,956 --> 00:25:53,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, like everyone else I think they are but there is a difference.

338
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:57,720
Speaker 0: like there's a meaningful difference because of course, there's differences of degree everywhere.

339
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:15,180
Speaker 0: But I do think when it comes to these kinds of companies, I'm not saying discord is great from this perspective but a company that has Zero sources of direct revenue versus a company that has at least one real Used source of direct revenue like Twitter has no direct revenue.

340
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,988
Speaker 0: They can only make money by betraying you and selling ads.

341
00:26:18,268 --> 00:26:22,480
Speaker 0: but at least discord has a way to pay them directly for stuff.

342
00:26:23,322 --> 00:26:24,707
Speaker 0: I will always trust a company.

343
00:26:24,807 --> 00:26:28,980
Speaker 0: I can pay with money over a company where there is literally no way to pay them with anything.

344
00:26:29,141 --> 00:26:40,956
Speaker 1: But stealing my soul getting my information spying on me selling the ads sure Whatever discord might be the main problem with discord is that you know, you know, it's gonna die.

345
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:42,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, everything's gonna die.

346
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:51,600
Speaker 0: I've I've lived through so much other works But I was able to preserve our alternative to Twitter with our friends at one point for you.

347
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:55,470
Speaker 1: But I can preserve all of my data from all of those.

348
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:59,040
Speaker 1: but discord it is much harder to back up a discord.

349
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,344
Speaker 0: Yep, I have a blog.

350
00:27:00,564 --> 00:27:09,689
Speaker 0: every chat I have ever had online with anyone ever going back to the year 1997 mine's not that comprehensive.

351
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:12,040
Speaker 1: But I mean I have a lot of chat logs going way back.

352
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:13,063
Speaker 0: I read the fire.

353
00:27:13,224 --> 00:27:16,394
Speaker 0: I can go back the first thing I ever said to Scott online.

354
00:27:16,715 --> 00:27:18,020
Speaker 0: We uh, I met.

355
00:27:18,682 --> 00:27:31,520
Speaker 0: He messaged me and he was like, hey, I was the guy who was at the anime club and I was like, oh, yeah Yeah, you want to meet at Gracie's for dinner and Scott was like sure and that was the first time we met Outside of the context of anime club in our way.

356
00:27:32,282 --> 00:27:34,529
Speaker 1: Yeah, I wasn't sure cuz it was sort of like.

357
00:27:34,609 --> 00:27:39,325
Speaker 1: I guess we were at an anime club and I guess I do an anime Club and I wasn't there.

358
00:27:39,445 --> 00:27:39,967
Speaker 0: cuz I skipped.

359
00:27:40,268 --> 00:27:42,316
Speaker 1: I mean, I guess I oh no, that's what it was.

360
00:27:42,336 --> 00:27:42,637
Speaker 1: It was the.

361
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:46,053
Speaker 1: It wasn't actually the anime club.

362
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:50,235
Speaker 1: It was our way D&d at our way with dammit Dwayne.

363
00:27:50,798 --> 00:27:58,137
Speaker 0: Yes Yeah it was after that session where we right rolled up characters for that game and then I was in that game as I was alone.

364
00:27:58,157 --> 00:28:08,604
Speaker 0: and then But then I kept seeing you, you know A very distinctive mustache hat first up and you stood out because you and Katsu were talking about like I just kept overhearing Proper nouns.

365
00:28:08,705 --> 00:28:11,074
Speaker 0: I cared about like battle tech something something.

366
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:12,579
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's pretty much it.

367
00:28:13,761 --> 00:28:16,572
Speaker 0: But I have detailed records of every conversation online.

368
00:28:16,592 --> 00:28:25,859
Speaker 0: I've ever had going back to that moment And it annoys me that there isn't just like a good API For me to scrape and archive everything that I've ever said on any discord ever.

369
00:28:26,161 --> 00:28:26,522
Speaker 1: You should.

370
00:28:26,582 --> 00:28:31,998
Speaker 1: discord should have a thing where a server administrator can save as and download it the.

371
00:28:32,018 --> 00:28:40,920
Speaker 1: you know Of every channel on the server, you know as a discord user You should be able to download and save as and text files all of your DMS.

372
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:47,200
Speaker 0: You know that IRC like thing that Tracy uses with discord does log everything, right?

373
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:49,168
Speaker 1: But that's logging things as they come through.

374
00:28:49,248 --> 00:29:00,780
Speaker 0: Yeah, but if I was rain something like that forever You'd have to run something to go back though and get all the old chats, yeah Might just have to start from now, but at least then we'd have everything from now onward.

375
00:29:01,601 --> 00:29:02,244
Speaker 1: I don't know how it works.

376
00:29:02,264 --> 00:29:03,348
Speaker 1: I haven't looked at anyway.

377
00:29:03,428 --> 00:29:05,175
Speaker 0: last but certainly not least.

378
00:29:05,215 --> 00:29:06,540
Speaker 0: This is a fascinating news.

379
00:29:06,841 --> 00:29:09,673
Speaker 0: I don't know if we ever talked about Brian swords of York on geek knives.

380
00:29:09,934 --> 00:29:10,657
Speaker 0: I feel like it was.

381
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:18,440
Speaker 0: we may have It had to have been a thing of the day, but you might have seen this YouTube video that made rounds years ago long time ago.

382
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,197
Speaker 1: We're so cool because we knew about this before.

383
00:29:20,217 --> 00:29:24,637
Speaker 0: it was cool And if you were a pro you might have seen this on TV in the 80s.

384
00:29:26,366 --> 00:29:26,998
Speaker 1: No one's that pro.

385
00:29:27,901 --> 00:29:28,764
Speaker 0: Someone had to be.

386
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:29,788
Speaker 0: but anyway, there is.

387
00:29:29,808 --> 00:29:31,776
Speaker 0: basically there was a PBS auction.

388
00:29:31,896 --> 00:29:32,840
Speaker 0: There's all into an article.

389
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:37,520
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna tell the whole story, but this auction had like a bunch of random crack to raise money for PBS.

390
00:29:37,941 --> 00:29:54,820
Speaker 0: but one of the things that kept coming up is there was this person named Brian swords who lived in York and Brian drew up anthropomorphic erotica, but tasteful Anthropomorphic erotica and That's the kind of thing that could just be on a PBS auction.

391
00:29:55,601 --> 00:30:04,320
Speaker 1: Like like he donated his artworks to support the local public television channel and they auctioned them off and made money To keep showing you Sesame Street.

392
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:04,407
Speaker 1: Yep.

393
00:30:04,660 --> 00:30:13,549
Speaker 0: And there was this just like compilation of YouTube of every time one of his art pieces appeared in these auctions The commentators like not making fun of it.

394
00:30:13,569 --> 00:30:15,980
Speaker 0: They were just like, oh, yeah, and here's a piece of art.

395
00:30:16,121 --> 00:30:19,060
Speaker 0: Oh, it's uh, looks like it's two rats and they're having a good time.

396
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:22,294
Speaker 0: This is a. this is an interesting piece and they would just talk about it.

397
00:30:22,375 --> 00:30:27,899
Speaker 0: and it's just like this Really really obvious furry erotica just hanging out on PBS in the 90s.

398
00:30:29,281 --> 00:30:37,739
Speaker 0: So fast forward 90s after 80s and 90s this 1992 is the year of the one that most people know the smell of wet fur.

399
00:30:38,685 --> 00:30:45,508
Speaker 0: so fast forward to Dateline today Many of you might have seen like rumblings of this.

400
00:30:45,568 --> 00:31:00,176
Speaker 0: but if you're not aware John Oliver of last week tonight Fend a very important human being who I love dearly has purchased the actual Original one that is most commonly known from Brian sorts of your.

401
00:31:00,396 --> 00:31:01,059
Speaker 0: he has it.

402
00:31:01,782 --> 00:31:04,354
Speaker 0: There's a picture of him holding the original painting.

403
00:31:04,374 --> 00:31:05,439
Speaker 0: it is done.

404
00:31:06,741 --> 00:31:10,817
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was I guess somehow he found out about Brian sorts of your any tweeted.

405
00:31:10,877 --> 00:31:15,512
Speaker 0: He was like, hey Does anyone know a Brian swords of York?

Speaker 0: I would like to purchase his art.

407
00:31:18,121 --> 00:31:19,667
Speaker 0: I want to track this down.

408
00:31:20,068 --> 00:31:21,032
Speaker 1: So I know he got the.

409
00:31:21,273 --> 00:31:22,036
Speaker 1: someone sold it to him.

410

Speaker 0: Yeah, apparently it's cool.

411
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:30,284
Speaker 0: We know some people who are closer to Brian swords orbit than I expected Mm-hmm.

412
00:31:30,304 --> 00:31:34,560
Speaker 0: So I almost want a frame picture of John Oliver holding this frame picture.

413
00:31:35,382 --> 00:31:37,429
Speaker 0: Okay, he looks so delighted with himself.

414
00:31:38,151 --> 00:31:38,954
Speaker 1: How was your thing of the day?

415
00:31:38,974 --> 00:31:50,993
Speaker 0: Uh, no, that was just some news but anyway, I guess it is time for things Of the day.

416
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:51,579
Speaker 0: So what do you got?

417
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:56,851
Speaker 1: so We were talking lately about all kinds of Animal Crossing biz and it.

418
00:31:57,091 --> 00:31:59,760
Speaker 1: people are like posting online all kinds of crazy stuff.

419
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:04,920
Speaker 1: That is like hard to believe because like how the turnip market works and all this other stuff, right?

420
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:07,153
Speaker 1: And it's like how did you figure this stuff out?

421
00:32:07,193 --> 00:32:14,051
Speaker 0: like data mom, you know It's like that long and it's not like a lot of yes Where you can dump the whole thing out and like read it in person.

422
00:32:14,091 --> 00:32:20,280
Speaker 1: a lot of people have posted stuff that's wrong Right or not quite exactly right so I can't trust them necessarily.

423
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:25,671
Speaker 1: so Apparently I didn't realize how far it had come.

424
00:32:25,731 --> 00:32:28,920
Speaker 1: I knew there was switch, you know homebrew stuff, right?

425
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:32,558
Speaker 1: But here is a link to like the actual switch home brews.

426
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:40,120
Speaker 1: You know people's is my thing of the day because they have come way further in switch homebrew than I had realized.

427
00:32:41,384 --> 00:32:53,647
Speaker 1: You can do some crazy stuff with switch homebrew and apparently if you do things correctly, it will not impair your ability to connect to switch online or Run legit games correctly.

428
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:58,060
Speaker 1: I would still personally recommend only doing this on like a spare switch.

429
00:32:58,321 --> 00:33:00,329
Speaker 1: Maybe grab a switch light and do it to that.

430
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:02,800
Speaker 1: No just in case you never know, right?

431
00:33:03,140 --> 00:33:08,255
Speaker 0: How cautious you are with your because Nintendo is not Sony bad, but Nintendo is the.

432
00:33:08,415 --> 00:33:09,699
Speaker 0: oh, I guess you bricked yourself.

433
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:19,404
Speaker 1: Sorry Right, but they are doing some phenomenal things and they have actual like supposed source code to the turnip market Was posted.

434
00:33:19,424 --> 00:33:22,180
Speaker 1: that could obviously change at any time with a version update to the game.

435
00:33:22,603 --> 00:33:24,919
Speaker 1: But that's supposedly the code that's being run right now.

436
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:32,897
Speaker 1: And there are several websites that you type in your current prices and they tell you you know What your prices could be coming up in the future?

437
00:33:32,917 --> 00:33:42,472
Speaker 1: So Yeah, if you're someone who's interested in some homebrewing running other software on your switch Maybe even pirating games if that's possible, you know do it.

438
00:33:42,512 --> 00:33:47,177
Speaker 1: changing your switch home screen to suck less It's kind of man.

439
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:52,883
Speaker 1: That's that's like one major thing you can do, you know, there's all kinds of crazy good stuff You can do.

440
00:33:52,944 --> 00:33:54,639
Speaker 1: write your own software to run on your switch.

441
00:33:55,163 --> 00:33:57,679
Speaker 1: You know me play some doom on there without buying it in the e-shop.

442
00:33:58,064 --> 00:34:05,480
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean I bought in the e-shop But I would I want to run a doom that can play remotely with other people the killer fucking app.

443
00:34:05,761 --> 00:34:09,795
Speaker 0: Well, I can no one ever do the obvious thing on a Nintendo platform right.

444
00:34:09,835 --> 00:34:13,788
Speaker 1: make your own switch software I'm sure is easily possible with this, right?

445
00:34:14,007 --> 00:34:16,775
Speaker 1: Yeah, this is a very detailed and cool guide.

446
00:34:16,795 --> 00:34:20,168
Speaker 1: - yeah No, it's like actually like totally legit.

447
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:21,313
Speaker 1: It's not legit.

448
00:34:21,333 --> 00:34:25,425
Speaker 1: It's a legit but but It works.

449
00:34:25,686 --> 00:34:28,275
Speaker 1: it legit and that it works not that it is legal.

450
00:34:28,815 --> 00:34:31,590
Speaker 0: So my thing of the day I was watching this over the weekend.

451
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:35,523
Speaker 0: I watched the beginning of it, but Apollo 13 in real time.

452
00:34:35,563 --> 00:34:37,087
Speaker 0: This is some cool ass shit.

453
00:34:37,127 --> 00:34:51,920
Speaker 0: So basically you go to this website and NASA has all the video all the audio all the transcripts photography Everything from the entire Apollo 13 mission all why we need to save all the chat from discord.

454
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:58,728
Speaker 0: So you can do right so what they've done and you can go right now and watch this Because it's the anniversary of Apollo 13.

455
00:34:58,728 --> 00:35:02,300
Speaker 0: They are replaying all of it in a really complex website.

456
00:35:02,380 --> 00:35:06,680
Speaker 0: You can be like like in real time as the events happened so long ago.

457
00:35:07,102 --> 00:35:11,120
Speaker 0: So you can log in right now and be like at this on this date at this time.

458
00:35:11,602 --> 00:35:16,540
Speaker 0: What was the like the person responsible for the thrusters saying to anyone in Mission Control?

459
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:21,220
Speaker 0: I want to see what the video was in like the secondary Mission Control Center.

460
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:25,939
Speaker 1: I want to get young until all the different people at the Mission Control in Houston all you know.

461
00:35:27,845 --> 00:35:30,214
Speaker 0: If you watch the movie like it feels like it was a pretty compressed thing.

462
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:37,277
Speaker 0: Apollo 13 went down over A lot longer period of time than you realize it is not until it didn't take 90 minutes.

463
00:35:37,578 --> 00:35:45,000
Speaker 0: It is 56 hours in is when the famous phrase that haunting Houston we have a problem happens, right?

464
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,945
Speaker 1: Imagine the movie was 56 hours long.

465
00:35:47,046 --> 00:35:51,378
Speaker 0: Yeah, so obviously I watched the entire launch because it's just amazing to see.

466
00:35:51,398 --> 00:35:58,513
Speaker 0: but You can also for a fast-forward rewind like you can jump to segments like if you want to see a particularly interesting bit.

467
00:35:59,017 --> 00:36:00,723
Speaker 0: this is Amazing.

468
00:36:00,844 --> 00:36:11,702
Speaker 0: and if you don't understand what's going on there is a Shockingly in-depth text commentary that is time synced to the entire thing that explains Everything.

469
00:36:11,742 --> 00:36:16,300
Speaker 0: like every acronym at one point they were like this guy sounds really boring, right?

470
00:36:16,621 --> 00:36:18,400
Speaker 0: It sounds like no one's paying attention to him, right?

471
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:27,706
Speaker 0: And then it goes into explain What that guy was saying and why he had to say it in the boring way he did and what purpose that served and it's just Pages and pages of this fascinating stuff.

472
00:36:28,188 --> 00:36:34,725
Speaker 1: stuff like this is super important simply not from the perspective of just you know space Yeah, but also just history.

473
00:36:34,825 --> 00:36:46,363
Speaker 1: if you look people talk about like pre-recorded history, right where we're doing archaeology and guessing Yeah, right Recorded history where it's like, oh, yeah, we have some writings of people in 1700 or whatever.

474
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:49,612
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like it's not, you know, there's so much, you know.

475
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:52,560
Speaker 1: guest work and interpretation Romans the earliest historians.

476
00:36:53,744 --> 00:37:01,447
Speaker 0: Some of the things that they wrote down are plausible, however Not likely right exactly.

477
00:37:01,829 --> 00:37:09,817
Speaker 0: So like I just think there were a hundred thousand soldiers at that battle, dude This kind of detailed recorded history, right?

478
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:18,460
Speaker 1: Is it basically as close to an objective complete recording of at least one zoomed in area at one zoomed in time?

479
00:37:19,002 --> 00:37:20,548
Speaker 1: That you can have to like?

480
00:37:20,568 --> 00:37:27,793
Speaker 1: if you sent this to someone in the distant distant future They would have basically other than maybe not knowing our language.

481
00:37:28,074 --> 00:37:30,060
Speaker 1: once they get past that right sort of thing.

482
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:35,256
Speaker 1: Yeah, there would be no question about what was what happened right at this point.

483
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:36,680
Speaker 1: Why was this event special?

484
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,745
Speaker 1: What was this event?

485
00:37:37,785 --> 00:37:38,710
Speaker 1: What was happening?

486
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:39,877
Speaker 1: What were people doing?

487
00:37:39,897 --> 00:37:39,997
Speaker 1: Right?

488
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:43,699
Speaker 1: Yeah long as you had basic understanding of like these are people.

489
00:37:44,342 --> 00:37:46,591
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it also really gives this perspective of like people.

490
00:37:46,611 --> 00:37:55,940
Speaker 0: think about Apollo 13 and the astronauts themselves But the number of people involved in a 10-second sequence where one engine has to do one thing.

491
00:37:56,781 --> 00:38:01,266
Speaker 0: I don't think people understand how big the Apollo program was.

492
00:38:01,687 --> 00:38:07,404
Speaker 0: as a project the number of people involved is Staggering is way less good.

493
00:38:07,444 --> 00:38:08,506
Speaker 1: You need a lot more people.

494
00:38:08,807 --> 00:38:11,413
Speaker 0: Yep, but also just like There's a lot.

495
00:38:11,453 --> 00:38:16,827
Speaker 0: even with modern computers modern space launches still require a terrifying number of people.

496
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:21,908
Speaker 0: Oh, yes So this is just so cool and I'm gonna continue to watch choice bits from it.

497
00:38:22,611 --> 00:38:27,344
Speaker 0: Also, it would be a lot harder watching if I didn't know how this ended because it's not a movie.

498
00:38:27,725 --> 00:38:29,410
Speaker 1: all the dramatization is removed.

499
00:38:29,511 --> 00:38:32,668
Speaker 1: Yeah, see what is it's really like for real real real.

500
00:38:33,211 --> 00:38:42,199
Speaker 0: It's like when the problem happens like you see some people kind of freak out like in the video in the background and like it's You can hear like the fear in their eyes.

501
00:38:42,259 --> 00:38:46,494
Speaker 0: because even watching the movie like as dramatized as it is We all know how it ended.

502
00:38:47,135 --> 00:38:50,503
Speaker 0: but they're like at the early parts of the disaster.

503
00:38:51,105 --> 00:38:53,210
Speaker 0: No one thought they were coming home, right?

504
00:38:53,310 --> 00:39:01,390
Speaker 1: There's also a difference between a real person Freaking out for real an actor protect acting as if they're freaked out people on the ground.

505
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:03,804
Speaker 0: We're freaking out way more than the astronauts.

506
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:04,749
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

507
00:39:06,313 --> 00:39:08,049
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, otherwise met a moment.

508
00:39:09,191 --> 00:39:13,449
Speaker 0: We're currently not reading the tale of Genji because we don't have commutes or free time.

509
00:39:14,671 --> 00:39:16,301
Speaker 1: Maybe I'll read some I don't know.

510
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:21,490
Speaker 0: I feel like I will as It gets a little warmer Like I'm gonna when I go for a long bike ride.

511
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:25,908
Speaker 0: I might like stop in an empty part of a park somewhere and read a little bit.

512
00:39:25,968 --> 00:39:26,250
Speaker 0: We'll see.

513
00:39:27,474 --> 00:39:28,059
Speaker 0: But I'm mostly.

514
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:29,110
Speaker 0: you know, it's weird.

515
00:39:29,931 --> 00:39:34,489
Speaker 0: I have this illusion of free time and that because I'm working from home every day and because of the way the world is.

516
00:39:34,509 --> 00:39:39,750
Speaker 1: I Have this sense that I have more free time, but there ain't a little bit of free time by not commuting.

517
00:39:39,932 --> 00:39:43,518
Speaker 0: Yeah, that saves me 22 minutes a weekday.

518
00:39:43,719 --> 00:39:43,920
Speaker 1: That's it.

519
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:48,380
Speaker 1: I've gained a little bit more free time by not showering Yep, but I don't actually.

520
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:55,590
Speaker 0: not only do I not have more free time But I picked up all these projects because I'm stuck at home and those projects are actually taking up more time.

521
00:39:55,872 --> 00:39:58,130
Speaker 0: I have less free time now than I did before the disaster.

522
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:02,410
Speaker 1: I made a significant progress on the meet redoing the geek night's website technology.

523
00:40:02,631 --> 00:40:02,952
Speaker 0: I am.

524
00:40:03,474 --> 00:40:08,150
Speaker 1: I've also spent a lot of time cooking because it used to be I just got home.

525
00:40:08,251 --> 00:40:11,743
Speaker 1: I don't really want to cook now Got all this time.

526
00:40:11,824 --> 00:40:12,270
Speaker 1: Let me cook.

527
00:40:12,310 --> 00:40:13,575
Speaker 1: Yeah, well cooking takes time.

528
00:40:13,595 --> 00:40:17,410
Speaker 0: that now I got some roasted root vegetables in there that I gotta go tend to at some point.

529
00:40:17,471 --> 00:40:18,448
Speaker 0: I got to make some chili.

530
00:40:19,532 --> 00:40:21,161
Speaker 1: All the cleaning I used to put off.

531
00:40:21,543 --> 00:40:22,005
Speaker 1: I'm cleaning.

532
00:40:22,146 --> 00:40:24,466
Speaker 1: Yep Just not myself.

533
00:40:26,931 --> 00:40:30,030
Speaker 0: So, uh, yeah, I don't actually have more free time, but we are doing a ton of projects.

534
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:30,792
Speaker 0: So stay tuned.

535
00:40:31,133 --> 00:40:37,270
Speaker 0: like our YouTube channels and like all our biz we are actively progressing on a lot of real projects.

536
00:40:38,051 --> 00:40:38,573
Speaker 0: Stay tuned.

537
00:40:38,593 --> 00:40:47,438
Speaker 0: like we're not taking this time idly geek nights is gonna bust out with more and more content But right now we're focused on Just yeah, I'm constantly doing stuff.

538
00:40:47,498 --> 00:40:50,110
Speaker 1: It's just it's got to get to done before anyone could see it.

539
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, I also started building a hurdy-gurdy kit and that's taking some time.

540
00:40:53,886 --> 00:40:54,369
Speaker 1: You got it.

541
00:40:54,449 --> 00:40:55,373
Speaker 0: Okay I'm already.

542
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:56,619
Speaker 0: I've built a good chunk of it.

543
00:40:56,659 --> 00:40:58,608
Speaker 1: But now I'm glad I am far away from it.

544
00:40:58,749 --> 00:41:01,335
Speaker 0: now I'm at the hard part Stringing that thing.

545
00:41:01,355 --> 00:41:02,719
Speaker 0: I do not look forward to.

546
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:03,843
Speaker 1: I hope you fail.

547
00:41:03,923 --> 00:41:05,829
Speaker 1: So you can't make annoying noises at me.

548
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:11,309
Speaker 0: Well, the problem is if I like playing this janky hurdy-gurdy probably gonna get a real one.

549
00:41:12,513 --> 00:41:18,876
Speaker 0: Okay, great So Postgres, why are we talking about Prosegress?

550
00:41:19,278 --> 00:41:36,070
Speaker 1: Well because in recent episodes and not even Mondays We've talked about how like, you know, if you are building any sort of modern System computer system It's almost definitely going to be just like a database and an application combo of some kind.

551
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:48,947
Speaker 1: yep, with some sort of you it interface right for users whether it's a desktop app or a web app or a mobile app and You should almost definitely just be doing Postgres as your database because it is the one.

552
00:41:49,087 --> 00:41:50,050
Speaker 0: Yeah now we've done.

553
00:41:50,190 --> 00:41:55,830
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure we did a geek nights on like what databases are and really get a nice on relational databases.

554
00:41:56,010 --> 00:42:03,310
Speaker 1: So we're not gonna repeat what a relational database is other than to say Postgres is a relational database that is free.

555
00:42:03,471 --> 00:42:06,171
Speaker 0: Oh, we did that show recently 2018.

556
00:42:06,171 --> 00:42:09,441
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we I think it might have been a repeat show might have been.

557
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:13,896
Speaker 0: I'll search around but basically there are a lot Of different relational database solutions.

558
00:42:13,916 --> 00:42:24,770
Speaker 0: We're not talking about non relational databases because frankly if You think you need a non relational database and you aren't already an expert in all this you are wrong And you're about to make a terrible mistake.

559
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:29,350
Speaker 0: If you are smart enough and right enough to where you know, you need a non relational database.

560
00:42:29,731 --> 00:42:32,018
Speaker 0: Don't listen to me or Scott for advice.

561
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:32,981
Speaker 1: That's right.

562
00:42:33,482 --> 00:42:36,170
Speaker 1: Oh and the thing is, you know, so the question is Postgres.

563
00:42:36,431 --> 00:42:38,760
Speaker 1: It's like why Postgres right?

564
00:42:38,840 --> 00:42:41,290
Speaker 1: What is special about this one versus the other ones?

565
00:42:41,470 --> 00:42:45,209
Speaker 1: Why should be this one the one that you go to without thinking about the other ones?

566
00:42:45,830 --> 00:42:54,957
Speaker 0: Until unless you have a reason I would say Postgres has been the one you should use for most purposes since about 2000 and Since a very long time.

567
00:42:54,998 --> 00:43:03,921
Speaker 1: so Postgres started out as not even SQL But it was like a Berkeley project as most computing things started out Way older than you realize right.

568
00:43:04,021 --> 00:43:09,182
Speaker 1: and then I think sometime in the 90s They had it's they they changed it up to Postgres 95.

569
00:43:09,182 --> 00:43:11,551
Speaker 0: I'd never heard of Postgres till like 2003.

570
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:25,910
Speaker 1: So yeah, Postgres 95 was a thing and then it finally became the open source project that it is now of Postgres SQL yeah sometime later in the 2000s and that project is still the project that is happening now.

571
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:30,964
Speaker 1: I think I'm not sure that when it switched over to its modern incarnation.

572
00:43:31,025 --> 00:43:36,230
Speaker 1: It was like Postgres 6 I want to say yeah, they went back to the original numbering

573
00:43:36,511 --> 00:43:45,492
Speaker 0: I have not used like the last time I used for like I used to manage and operate a High performance Postgres databases as a job like that used to be a thing I did.

574
00:43:45,533 --> 00:43:55,953
Speaker 0: that was something I was paid a lot of money to do but That was circa 2008 like that era but they're currently on Postgres 12.

575
00:43:55,953 --> 00:44:03,965
Speaker 0: Yep, like back when I was using Postgres on a day-to-day basis It did not really have reliable binary replication or disaster recovery capabilities.

576
00:44:04,306 --> 00:44:11,470
Speaker 0: I had to hack together like Replicating the like the back-end stores on DRBD and all this sort of nonsense.

577
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:13,310
Speaker 0: But Postgres has evolved rapidly.

578
00:44:13,370 --> 00:44:26,535
Speaker 0: The thing I'll say is that in that era even back then in like 2008 ish Postgres was already way better than any other free database solution like my sequel In the non free one.

579
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:36,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, like Postgres I found performed better than Oracle for the things I was using it for the other commercial ones Microsoft sequel why?

580
00:44:36,498 --> 00:44:41,476
Speaker 0: and my sequel like not that great I mean my sequel.

581
00:44:41,556 --> 00:44:45,010
Speaker 1: it's the reason my sequel took off was because easy.

582
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:51,370
Speaker 1: It's all news is also free and easy to use and a lot of things were built on top of it.

583
00:44:51,450 --> 00:45:04,430
Speaker 0: That would would not work with other solutions like so many web apps back then were like download this software Download my sequel install my head point your software at my sequel and the software will set up the database and just work.

584
00:45:04,992 --> 00:45:22,490
Speaker 1: Right before we had you know cloud hosting like we have today the typical web stack was PHP, which had a good connector for my sequel not so much for Postgres and So you would run PHP my sequel to get your website running with Apache and that was like this lamp stack.

585
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:24,415
Speaker 1: And that was the stack and it.

586
00:45:24,876 --> 00:45:36,017
Speaker 1: that stack dying and becoming less popular people moving away from PHP specifically to other languages and had Postgres connectors is Postgres is better than my sequel.

587
00:45:36,137 --> 00:45:39,530
Speaker 0: even in the lamp stack the performance was night and day in my experience.

588
00:45:39,931 --> 00:45:56,216
Speaker 1: Right, and it not just that but just like basic things like handling Unicode correctly all these basic fundamental things that you don't realize right foreign key constraints working properly supporting modern features I'm just remembering some shit.

589
00:45:56,256 --> 00:45:57,842
Speaker 0: I went right.

590
00:45:58,404 --> 00:45:59,186
Speaker 1: It's just like all this.

591
00:45:59,307 --> 00:46:02,530
Speaker 0: It's just Postgres very right janky.

592
00:46:03,491 --> 00:46:04,416
Speaker 1: Yeah, no Postgres.

593
00:46:04,637 --> 00:46:05,441
Speaker 1: It's a database.

594
00:46:05,481 --> 00:46:06,626
Speaker 1: It does things the right way.

595
00:46:06,707 --> 00:46:08,374
Speaker 1: It works the way It's supposed to work.

596
00:46:08,775 --> 00:46:16,263
Speaker 1: and whether you're someone who doesn't even know anything about the database You're just doing basic sequel or you're doing fancy fancy shit.

597
00:46:17,026 --> 00:46:18,090
Speaker 1: It it totally works.

598
00:46:18,331 --> 00:46:18,391
Speaker 1: I

599
00:46:18,471 --> 00:46:36,245
Speaker 0: found like in my professional career up until I stopped being at the level where I interacted with systems directly I found that generally systems that I inherited that were based on my sequel We're only based on my sequel because that's what someone set up who didn't really know what they were doing a long time ago And anything new was Postgres like everything was Postgres.

600
00:46:36,587 --> 00:46:40,382
Speaker 0: even in my current job I've had engineers migrate things to Postgres because it's great.

601
00:46:40,442 --> 00:46:40,643
Speaker 1: Right?

602
00:46:41,105 --> 00:46:42,390
Speaker 1: So what makes Postgres so great?

603
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:48,630
Speaker 1: Well, first of all, we already talked about how it's free and how it just does everything right normally right out of the gate.

604
00:46:49,533 --> 00:46:51,200
Speaker 1: So that's a good reason to use it.

605
00:46:51,501 --> 00:47:00,610
Speaker 1: Yeah, the real reason Postgres is great is All the other things it does that you may not ever need to use but are there for you when you need them.

606
00:47:01,211 --> 00:47:06,607
Speaker 1: That make it so that you're not really looking at other tools too much.

607
00:47:06,828 --> 00:47:08,293
Speaker 1: It's like Simon It's like a right.

608
00:47:08,655 --> 00:47:10,924
Speaker 1: It's like usually you have to choose in the world.

609
00:47:10,964 --> 00:47:13,641
Speaker 1: when you're when you're picking out tools You might be like, okay.

610
00:47:13,681 --> 00:47:14,650
Speaker 1: Well, here's a chef's knife.

611
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:22,050
Speaker 1: It's really good at cutting and I can use it a lot of different ways, but it's still just a chef's knife I can't screw to use it as a screwdriver.

612
00:47:22,494 --> 00:47:24,070
Speaker 1: Right that I need a Swiss Army knife.

613
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:30,339
Speaker 0: I could try really hard to use this screwdriver But I might hurt myself and I'm definitely fucking up both the knife and the screw Right now.

614
00:47:30,420 --> 00:47:36,603
Speaker 1: imagine a Swiss Army knife but the knife on it is a chef's knife and the screwdriver is like an amazing screwdriver.

615
00:47:36,724 --> 00:47:42,500
Speaker 1: and the corkscrew is an amazing corkscrew and None of them might be as good as the best.

616
00:47:42,560 --> 00:47:43,101
Speaker 1: right this?

617
00:47:43,182 --> 00:47:49,450
Speaker 1: the chef's knife on there isn't as good isn't the best chef's knife In the world, but it's like damn good, right?

618
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:53,007
Speaker 1: Like no one's you know, what's gonna reject that one saying it's not good enough.

619
00:47:53,268 --> 00:47:53,730
Speaker 1: Nope, right?

620
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:56,450
Speaker 1: It's like 90% as good as the best one, right?

621
00:47:56,892 --> 00:47:58,119
Speaker 1: So that's a Postgres did so.

622
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:01,113
Speaker 1: examples of things Postgres does Right.

623
00:48:01,494 --> 00:48:06,108
Speaker 1: So for example, you know, you're doing your SQL right and normally when you got SQL you got columns.

624
00:48:06,168 --> 00:48:06,770
Speaker 1: They got numbers.

625
00:48:07,122 --> 00:48:08,835
Speaker 1: Yeah They got caret text right.

626
00:48:09,517 --> 00:48:16,879
Speaker 1: a lot of applications out there have to put in some kind of weird data That you don't query with text or numbers right.

627
00:48:17,341 --> 00:48:20,650
Speaker 1: the most common example of this is GPS data, right?

628
00:48:21,230 --> 00:48:25,590
Speaker 1: It's two numbers usually right your latitude and your longitude down to a bunch of decimal points.

629
00:48:26,072 --> 00:48:30,610
Speaker 1: But when you want to query it, you don't want to do greater than less than plus minus, right?

630
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:33,176
Speaker 1: You got to say here's some GPS coordinates.

631
00:48:33,477 --> 00:48:38,469
Speaker 1: query this table and give me the one that's closest by distance, right?

632
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:43,970
Speaker 1: or Yeah, someone gave me an address and here's the location of that city.

633
00:48:44,516 --> 00:48:52,570
Speaker 1: Give me all G Give me all rows in this table that have GPS coordinates within this radius because they're you know within five miles of Scott.

634
00:48:52,651 --> 00:48:53,798
Speaker 1: He wants to find the restaurants.

635
00:48:53,878 --> 00:48:55,026
Speaker 1: Yeah that are nearby, right?

636
00:48:56,610 --> 00:48:57,253
Speaker 1: How do you do that?

637
00:48:57,615 --> 00:48:59,425
Speaker 1: Postgres has a thing called post GIS.

638
00:48:59,445 --> 00:49:00,028
Speaker 1: that just does it?

639
00:49:00,229 --> 00:49:01,033
Speaker 0: Yep I'm looking.

640
00:49:01,053 --> 00:49:03,546
Speaker 0: I'm looking at the list because I haven't used Postgres directly in a while.

641
00:49:03,868 --> 00:49:04,190
Speaker 0: the date.

642
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,358
Speaker 0: There are some fascinating data types in here.

643
00:49:06,378 --> 00:49:07,442
Speaker 0: Yeah.

644
00:49:07,462 --> 00:49:07,984
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's like.

645
00:49:08,124 --> 00:49:09,670
Speaker 1: so you think that's just one case.

646
00:49:09,790 --> 00:49:14,428
Speaker 1: No, it has these sorts of things for every case that you can imagine.

647
00:49:14,468 --> 00:49:21,270
Speaker 1: let you know I've seen stuff for like graphs and spherical coordinates and all sorts of other crazy biz.

648
00:49:21,711 --> 00:49:27,530
Speaker 0: Alright, like do you know how many times I've seen people put like IP addresses in like MySQL databases just as strings?

649
00:49:28,790 --> 00:49:29,357
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

650
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:29,782
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

651
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:37,910
Speaker 0: Yeah Address fields like another main feature like the triggers and Postgres are really good.

652
00:49:38,812 --> 00:49:43,950
Speaker 0: Yeah way better than like what I would do with an equivalent stored procedure in some bullshit data.

653
00:49:44,030 --> 00:49:52,062
Speaker 1: Oh, yes, all those basic database features that you expect views materialized views Triggers all these sort they've.

654
00:49:52,223 --> 00:49:54,753
Speaker 1: now they've added Notifications.

655
00:49:54,893 --> 00:49:56,821
Speaker 0: actually notifications are added a while ago.

656
00:49:56,841 --> 00:49:57,725
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

657
00:49:57,765 --> 00:50:00,193
Speaker 1: No this night Right.

658
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,358
Speaker 1: Yeah, they have.

659
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:01,579
Speaker 1: they've.

660
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:08,641
Speaker 1: more recently they've added a computed columns, so Normally, let's say you have a table.

661
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:10,569
Speaker 1: Yeah, and in the table you have a name.

662
00:50:12,072 --> 00:50:13,398
Speaker 1: Add your birth year, right?

663
00:50:13,438 --> 00:50:18,943
Speaker 1: I was born in 1982 and you did like damn I want to add a column that says how old you are, right?

664
00:50:19,205 --> 00:50:20,330
Speaker 1: I know your birth date.

665
00:50:20,591 --> 00:50:21,738
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but I need to.

666
00:50:21,799 --> 00:50:23,610
Speaker 1: I just want to know how many years the old you are.

667
00:50:23,670 --> 00:50:24,396
Speaker 0: There's a lot of.

668
00:50:24,497 --> 00:50:26,736
Speaker 0: there's a lot of bad ways to do that Right.

669
00:50:26,756 --> 00:50:33,910
Speaker 1: So you could in the old days What you could do is you could a make a real column and have your application keep one of the columns up to date.

670
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:40,901
Speaker 0: I would probably in my old dumb days either make a view for that or In SQL directly, right?

671
00:50:40,921 --> 00:50:47,269
Speaker 1: You can make a view that would Produce another second table that has the extra column on it.

672
00:50:47,390 --> 00:50:50,390
Speaker 1: Yeah, right and not and you would query that view instead of querying.

673
00:50:50,511 --> 00:50:51,700
Speaker 0: That's probably what I would have done.

674
00:50:51,761 --> 00:50:52,870
Speaker 0: thinking back to you could do that.

675
00:50:53,172 --> 00:50:56,530
Speaker 1: You could set up a database trigger to populate at that third column.

676
00:50:56,670 --> 00:51:00,081
Speaker 1: Yeah, right, but now they have actually just computed columns.

677
00:51:00,221 --> 00:51:00,924
Speaker 1: see every table.

678
00:51:01,205 --> 00:51:07,747
Speaker 1: you add a computed column and you say yeah This column equals this function this function on that other column done.

679
00:51:08,249 --> 00:51:13,490
Speaker 0: Yep It just have it or a feat like the feature other than because binary replication of disaster recovery.

680
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:18,830
Speaker 0: That was added like a long time ago, but the notifications are even better because I remembered that they'd added notifications.

681
00:51:18,910 --> 00:51:20,456
Speaker 0: They were good, but now I'm reading details.

682
00:51:20,777 --> 00:51:22,946
Speaker 0: They're way better than I realized.

683
00:51:23,307 --> 00:51:24,050
Speaker 1: everything's better.

684
00:51:24,331 --> 00:51:30,350
Speaker 0: You can replace a lot of the things you would use like an enterprise service bus or a polling system.

685
00:51:30,771 --> 00:51:33,240
Speaker 0: Just with the database you can just yeah.

686
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:38,865
Speaker 0: Hey if this table gets updated in this way Notify this endpoints right now.

687
00:51:38,925 --> 00:51:47,230
Speaker 1: a lot of a Reservation I've had as a programmer right is I've always stayed away from putting too many things in the database especially business logic.

688
00:51:47,952 --> 00:51:53,145
Speaker 1: Right because when something's in the database, it's not in your say git repository.

689
00:51:53,265 --> 00:51:54,970
Speaker 1: You're not carrying that around with you.

690
00:51:55,050 --> 00:51:55,735
Speaker 1: That's lost.

691
00:51:55,916 --> 00:51:57,669
Speaker 1: It's like in this other area, right?

692
00:51:59,391 --> 00:52:03,730
Speaker 1: And when you work with old systems that have a lot of things in the database, that's a big problem.

693
00:52:03,730 --> 00:52:05,925
Speaker 1: It's like this hidden part of the application.

694
00:52:05,945 --> 00:52:06,610
Speaker 1: You don't understand.

695
00:52:07,731 --> 00:52:09,379
Speaker 1: Where is the code that does this?

696
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:10,364
Speaker 1: Oh, it's in the database.

697
00:52:10,384 --> 00:52:11,570
Speaker 0: I felt there's not a problem at IBM.

698
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:26,495
Speaker 0: I couldn't solve forever and finally got the database team on to look at it And the problem was every time this data got inserted into the database There was a local stored procedure that would call out to an external service do some bullshit and then change the road That was inserted.

699
00:52:26,515 --> 00:52:28,405
Speaker 0: Yeah with business logic.

700
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:35,859
Speaker 1: Yep So what you what I do these days to handle that is I just put all my SQL into my code, right?

701
00:52:37,451 --> 00:52:41,940
Speaker 1: so that like So for example, would you go to front-row-crew.com?

702
00:52:42,140 --> 00:52:45,150
Speaker 1: right if you were to say take the code of front-row-crew.com?

703
00:52:45,190 --> 00:52:48,237
Speaker 1: And you wanted to make your own website You have a blank postgres.

704
00:52:48,277 --> 00:52:51,590
Speaker 1: you have to make a user with enough permissions to execute the SQL obviously.

705
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:53,901
Speaker 1: But then all the SQL is there.

706
00:52:53,921 --> 00:53:03,370
Speaker 1: so you just type a command and it would build The front-row-crew.com database for you out of nothing including any views that had to be made or anything like that.

707
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:07,851
Speaker 0: You know, that's a pattern I used at my last few jobs as well I can't?

708
00:53:07,891 --> 00:53:18,185
Speaker 0: we sold software and what we put together was the like the genericized SQL Method of creating the database structure regardless of what database type you're using right?

709
00:53:18,205 --> 00:53:19,228
Speaker 1: So an example, right?

710
00:53:19,268 --> 00:53:22,177
Speaker 1: So just the other day I'm working on because we're upgrading for a crew.

711
00:53:22,198 --> 00:53:22,719
Speaker 1: calm right.

712
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:27,610
Speaker 1: the old front-row-crew.com had my sequel because it was originally WordPress and the original days, right?

713
00:53:27,870 --> 00:53:32,510
Speaker 1: Yeah, and again, I got all that data out of there and I want to bring it over to a new postgres database.

714
00:53:33,072 --> 00:53:36,146
Speaker 1: So they have a feature called the foreign data wrapper, right?

715
00:53:36,528 --> 00:53:36,970
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah.

716
00:53:38,176 --> 00:53:41,975
Speaker 1: So the foreign data wrapper is this amazing thing Which I highly recommend.

717
00:53:42,036 --> 00:54:04,769
Speaker 1: back in the day if you wanted to migrate from say my sequel to postgres What you would do is you would do something like dump your MySQL database Into a SQL file massage that SQL and then run that SQL on postgres to insert all the rows Right or run a bunch of queries on my SQL to generate like a CSV or some set of csv's or something like

718
00:54:04,809 --> 00:54:05,010
Speaker 0: that

719
00:54:05,614 --> 00:54:07,230
Speaker 1: And then insert those in the postgres.

720
00:54:07,431 --> 00:54:07,571
Speaker 1: I don't.

721
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:12,170
Speaker 1: you'd have like up some sort of procedure that you'd have to do with the foreign data wrapper.

722
00:54:12,270 --> 00:54:14,741
Speaker 1: What I do is I tell postgres.

723
00:54:14,761 --> 00:54:15,725
Speaker 1: Hey postgres.

724
00:54:15,765 --> 00:54:16,830
Speaker 1: There's a MySQL server.

725
00:54:17,292 --> 00:54:31,270
Speaker 1: You can connect to it on this IP address with this username and password and it says Alright cool, and then I say oh by the way postgres Look at all the tables in that MySQL database and make tables on your side that exactly match those tables.

726
00:54:31,410 --> 00:54:33,076
Speaker 1: Yeah, it says okay.

727
00:54:33,116 --> 00:54:37,710
Speaker 1: I made tables that exactly match those tables and now I'm in postgres on my local machine.

728
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:46,490
Speaker 1: I go to a table I query it postgres queries my SQL Gets the data and returns it to me as if I had queried a local table.

729
00:54:47,232 --> 00:54:54,113
Speaker 0: If any of you know that my site we managing databases before where you're trying to migrate from an old database system to a new Database system.

730
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:56,082
Speaker 0: I think you can already see the potential here.

731
00:54:56,605 --> 00:54:59,620
Speaker 1: and now you think oh, yeah So one relational database to another.

732
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,330
Speaker 1: that's kind of fancy and really powerful.

733
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:06,028
Speaker 1: No, the foreign data wrapper can wrap all sorts of any data source.

734
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:17,990
Speaker 1: You can wrap API's in the cloud as web servers Where you can so you can write you can wrap a file you can have a CSV file You can have someone's Excel spreadsheet and wrap it and now it's a postgres table.

735
00:55:18,010 --> 00:55:25,757
Speaker 0: So you could write your application to only interact with postgres now and forever and then all your legacy wells Any data source that you have.

736
00:55:25,817 --> 00:55:29,208
Speaker 1: you can SQL it by putting a foreign data wrapper and postgres around it.

737
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:32,230
Speaker 1: Yep So that's a basic included feature.

738
00:55:32,511 --> 00:55:32,772
Speaker 0: I guess

739
00:55:32,792 --> 00:55:33,797
Speaker 1: my advice just works

740
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:44,866
Speaker 0: to all of you like to kind of wrap up like where we're going with this Is that if you're young and getting into like you're in school or you're doing your first jobs and you're in programming Like computer science or anything like that.

741
00:55:44,906 --> 00:55:51,950
Speaker 0: for one Learn how databases work because too many programmers don't know how databases work and basically reimplement databases in their code.

742
00:55:52,571 --> 00:55:58,827
Speaker 0: Yep, but to learn postgres specifically because postgres is really well made.

743
00:55:58,907 --> 00:56:01,813
Speaker 0: if you learn postgres You can work with any goddamn database on earth.

744
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:04,859
Speaker 1: You can also solve almost any problem.

745
00:56:04,939 --> 00:56:07,357
Speaker 1: It's like It's constantly at work.

746
00:56:07,377 --> 00:56:10,110
Speaker 1: We have all our data in postgres and it's like oh, no, we have a problem.

747
00:56:10,632 --> 00:56:18,219
Speaker 1: I have found a solution that involves SQL and does not involve me having the algorithm like oh We have this field with a dumb default value.

748
00:56:18,259 --> 00:56:20,690
Speaker 0: Can we change the default value without messed up anything else?

749
00:56:20,830 --> 00:56:26,910
Speaker 1: Yeah in a database that is trivial Don't think about postgres as like a place you store all your data.

750
00:56:27,251 --> 00:56:41,964
Speaker 1: You have to think about it as this program that can solve information problems, right and it already has all of the well-known commonly needed information Problem solutions built in for you to use.

751
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:46,680
Speaker 1: you just have to learn Which prob which problem you have and what the solution is.

752
00:56:46,741 --> 00:56:49,570
Speaker 1: and there it is for you already implemented basically perfectly.

753
00:56:50,213 --> 00:56:51,277
Speaker 1: Just take advantage of it.

754
00:56:51,519 --> 00:56:53,949
Speaker 1: Yeah, I couldn't even scratch the surface before getting hungry.

755
00:56:54,351 --> 00:56:56,638
Speaker 1: So many other things relative.

756
00:56:56,999 --> 00:56:59,728
Speaker 1: Yeah, they got JSON fields this search involved.

757
00:56:59,768 --> 00:57:00,470
Speaker 1: They got L tree.

758
00:57:00,813 --> 00:57:09,269
Speaker 0: also, the full text search in postgres is Fast enough to where a lot of people could use that as their primary means of querying.

759
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:11,567
Speaker 0: postgres Like it'll actually perform pretty well.

760
00:57:12,251 --> 00:57:14,336
Speaker 0: Just a full text search your whole goddamn database.

761
00:57:14,637 --> 00:57:18,608
Speaker 1: Postgres can even do like your image processing for you, right?

762
00:57:18,748 --> 00:57:19,470
Speaker 1: It's that crazy.

763
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:23,461
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're going into IT database management is really important.

764
00:57:24,003 --> 00:57:33,070
Speaker 0: learn how to get a postgres server Running and how to deal with it because it doesn't matter what's in a database if you're an IT doing support or operation.

765
00:57:33,332 --> 00:57:41,350
Speaker 0: If you know how to work with databases You can be the go-to person to solve like 80% of all problems that happen.

766
00:57:42,451 --> 00:57:44,619
Speaker 0: Like you'll become the database go-to person.

767
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,868
Speaker 0: That is a really good way to get your career.

768
00:57:47,048 --> 00:57:54,030
Speaker 1: like god I like bootstrap it and most of the programming that you can do right if you're not stuck at someplace with COBOL.

769
00:57:54,091 --> 00:58:02,853
Speaker 1: Yeah if you want to make money as a programmer with a job at a company almost all the code you write is gonna be some code that goes between That.

770
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:06,178
Speaker 1: a has code to tell postgres to solve a problem Yeah.

771
00:58:06,591 --> 00:58:12,410
Speaker 1: And then B takes data from postgres and massages it to present it to users and buy and back and forth.

772
00:58:12,731 --> 00:58:14,562
Speaker 1: Yeah, that's the code that almost I've written it.

773
00:58:14,602 --> 00:58:18,664
Speaker 1: pretty much every job is Code that goes between a person and a database.

774
00:58:18,966 --> 00:58:28,521
Speaker 0: Yep, right Like as soon as you get to the point where you need more than postgres plus code to interact with the data in the postgres You're edging into enterprise nonsense.

775
00:58:28,662 --> 00:58:33,315
Speaker 1: Even you've gone down a very bad territory Postgres can still get the job.

776
00:58:33,335 --> 00:58:35,000
Speaker 1: You just might need more postcresses.

777
00:58:35,301 --> 00:58:36,264
Speaker 0: Yeah more hardware.

778
00:58:36,365 --> 00:58:41,306
Speaker 0: or you need a few other Specialized things that are like postgres for adjacent areas.

779
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:52,850
Speaker 1: It takes a lot before You would have to have some crazy problem and some crazy scale like Google level before you would be Having to leave postgres because it's you know, right?

780
00:58:53,250 --> 00:58:59,870
Speaker 0: It's not gonna cause you problems like the next area you would leave postgres for and this is again a giant scale.

781
00:59:00,192 --> 00:59:02,950
Speaker 0: It's things like enterprise service buses and middlewares.

782
00:59:03,311 --> 00:59:08,290
Speaker 0: But at that point you're solving problems that 99% of the people listening will never encounter in their lives.

783
00:59:08,573 --> 00:59:09,585
Speaker 1: No, never in your whole life.

784
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:17,350
Speaker 1: So whether it's your local website or the company you work for This is this is the thing and it has been the thing for a long time.

785
00:59:17,450 --> 00:59:19,639
Speaker 1: So I see no reason it would not continue to be this and

786
00:59:19,720 --> 00:59:21,266
Speaker 0: one thing I can really want to stress before

787
00:59:21,547 --> 00:59:23,476
Speaker 1: it deserves its Own geek nights episode even

788
00:59:23,496 --> 00:59:32,389
Speaker 0: back in like 2007 2008 a problem My head with things like my sequel and like all these other things was the documentation was kind of bad like wasn't super clear.

789
00:59:32,931 --> 00:59:34,535
Speaker 0: Didn't just explain postgres.

790
00:59:34,575 --> 00:59:37,824
Speaker 0: is documentation has always been a plus?

791
00:59:37,884 --> 00:59:39,227
Speaker 0: like it is not I think it's.

792
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:40,310
Speaker 1: I think it's a minus.

793
00:59:40,471 --> 00:59:43,669
Speaker 1: I think the problem that I have with it is it doesn't show enough examples.

794
00:59:44,772 --> 00:59:45,759
Speaker 1: It's a good like you look up.

795
00:59:45,860 --> 00:59:50,780
Speaker 1: if you look up some SQL in there You get a document that fully explains every option you can possibly give.

796
00:59:51,261 --> 00:59:52,585
Speaker 1: and they don't give an actual.

797
00:59:52,625 --> 01:00:02,155
Speaker 1: just add an example of that SQL actually being used Data because I SQL and all the other databases.

798
01:00:02,175 --> 01:00:07,750
Speaker 0: the problem was the documentation consisted primarily of examples, but it didn't explain exactly what that parameter.

799
01:00:07,951 --> 01:00:15,736
Speaker 1: Yeah, the postgres documentation explains everything and then if you if you just do Google searches the next not page out You find will be example.

800
01:00:16,118 --> 01:00:18,469
Speaker 1: someone else or I was like, here's how to use this thing, right?

801
01:00:19,111 --> 01:00:20,297
Speaker 0: So, all right.

802
01:00:20,318 --> 01:00:20,760
Speaker 0: All right.

803
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:25,229
Speaker 0: So yeah, I'll leave you with this in 2008. ish this is so long ago.

804
01:00:25,893 --> 01:00:35,610
Speaker 0: We use postgres to run the real-time live Transactional system for trades at a major dark pool in US capital markets like algorithmic trading.

805
01:00:36,436 --> 01:00:41,772
Speaker 0: That was the performance level you could achieve in 2008.

806
01:00:41,772 --> 01:00:42,334
Speaker 1: It's now 2020.

807
01:00:42,334 --> 01:00:45,305
Speaker 0: Yeah postgres has come a long way and now I really got a 12.

808
01:00:45,305 --> 01:00:52,920
Speaker 0: Yes This has been geek nights with rim and Scott special.

809
01:00:52,980 --> 01:00:57,719
Speaker 0: Thanks to DJ pretzel for the opening music cat leave for web design and Brando K for the logos.

818
01:02:02,912 --> 01:02:12,430
Speaker 0: We are closer to resuming having a Scott cam in the live streams But I got to continue to fuss with some RTMP servers and some tech were sorting out.

819
01:02:12,851 --> 01:02:18,010
Speaker 0: The pipelines are getting more complex, but this will all bear fruit when we eventually start doing board game live streams.

820
01:02:18,571 --> 01:02:26,150
Speaker 0: But anyway now I leave you with something you may have forgotten and even if he did he wouldn't comprehend them.

821
01:02:26,852 --> 01:02:28,678
Speaker 1: I've dwelt among the humans.

822
01:02:29,140 --> 01:02:32,170
Speaker 0: their entire culture is built around their penises.

823
01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:34,761
Speaker 1: It's funny to say they are small.

824
01:02:35,343 --> 01:02:36,930
Speaker 1: It's funny to say they are big.

825
01:02:37,573 --> 01:02:45,522
Speaker 1: I've been at parties where humans have held bottles Pencils thermoses in front of themselves and called out.

826
01:02:45,944 --> 01:02:46,927
Speaker 1: Hey look at me.

827
01:02:46,947 --> 01:02:49,013
Speaker 1: I'm mr So-and-so dick.

828
01:02:49,575 --> 01:02:51,580
Speaker 0: I've got such-and-such for a penis.

829
01:02:52,523 --> 01:02:54,548
Speaker 0: I never saw it fail to get a laugh.

830
01:02:54,809 --> 01:02:55,829
Speaker 0: all right That's enough.
