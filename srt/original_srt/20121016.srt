1
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:12,613
Speaker 1: Hey, it's Tuesday, October 16th, 2012.

2
00:00:12,613 --> 00:00:13,194
Speaker 1: I'm rim.

3
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:23,058
Speaker 1: I'm sky and this is geek night tonight Genoa the traitors of Let's do this.

4
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:30,594
Speaker 1: So I found the secret to beating FTL pretty much 90% of the time.

5
00:00:30,614 --> 00:00:31,356
Speaker 1: cheating on easy.

6
00:00:31,376 --> 00:00:35,490
Speaker 1: cheating on easy Just like fucking max out your shield.

7
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:37,080
Speaker 1: just go for it like you can't lose.

8
00:00:38,021 --> 00:00:40,955
Speaker 0: I've gotten to the boss of max shields four or five times.

9
00:00:41,016 --> 00:00:41,378
Speaker 0: I know what.

10
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:41,880
Speaker 1: no weapons.

11
00:00:42,262 --> 00:00:44,773
Speaker 0: I had plenty of weapons and I was still unable to beat the boss.

12
00:00:44,834 --> 00:00:46,220
Speaker 1: the saddest thing that ever happened to me.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,396
Speaker 1: Those like I've never won using like the crew teleporter II thing.

14
00:00:50,436 --> 00:00:51,400
Speaker 1: I only really tried to do.

15
00:00:51,460 --> 00:00:53,880
Speaker 0: I've only recently learned how to use that without fucking yourself.

16
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,315
Speaker 0: But the problem with it is is you fuck up once with it and you're done.

17
00:00:57,335 --> 00:00:58,984
Speaker 1: It's how you're like, all right I've got one dude.

18
00:00:59,064 --> 00:01:00,090
Speaker 0: It's like I got really.

19
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:01,720
Speaker 0: I finally got really good at using it.

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,060
Speaker 0: I leveled it up and everything and I was going in and I had I had you know mantises and rock men to attack with.

21
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,148
Speaker 0: So I'm sending them over and beating them up.

22
00:01:09,228 --> 00:01:12,320
Speaker 0: I'm destroying ships without killing, you know with only killing the cruise.

23
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,450
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've been doing that mostly with the oxygen.

24
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,740
Speaker 1: like I'll just I unblast the oxygen until they die.

25
00:01:17,424 --> 00:01:19,840
Speaker 0: That doesn't even work for me because they just keep fucking repairing it.

26
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,931
Speaker 0: I need to actually kill their people so that they can't repair the.

27
00:01:22,971 --> 00:01:25,521
Speaker 1: I have killed many a ship just by letting the oxygen run Out.

28
00:01:25,702 --> 00:01:26,625
Speaker 0: I've tried that.

29
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:29,517
Speaker 0: just shoot ion at the oxygen and wait with such defense.

30
00:01:29,557 --> 00:01:30,200
Speaker 0: They can't hurt me.

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,859
Speaker 0: Thanks a while, but it works and they just repair it as fast as I shoot it.

32
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:38,320
Speaker 1: If you keep shooting you'll kill the guys in there and not with ion can use like a bomb.

33
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,413
Speaker 0: But if I shoot it with any weapon bombs don't damage the hull.

34
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:42,920
Speaker 0: I got to get a bomb.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,512
Speaker 1: Yes, I get a bomb again.

36
00:01:44,532 --> 00:01:45,519
Speaker 0: You had to use the missiles.

37
00:01:46,562 --> 00:01:49,260
Speaker 1: Then I gotta get four gameboys and I gotta get four links.

38
00:01:49,481 --> 00:01:52,995
Speaker 0: I can never seem to get the stuff that I you know into.

39
00:01:53,075 --> 00:01:56,148
Speaker 0: it's like for example one game I played and I was the Engi ships.

40
00:01:56,168 --> 00:01:57,373
Speaker 0: you start with the drone, right?

41
00:01:57,695 --> 00:02:02,130
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, and then at the first Shop there's another anti-ship drone.

42
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,395
Speaker 1: Yeah, I ship drones.

43
00:02:03,435 --> 00:02:03,636
Speaker 0: Fuck.

44
00:02:03,676 --> 00:02:08,739
Speaker 0: Yeah, so I'm like fuck Yeah, and I buy that shit right and I keep going along and I'm keep.

45
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:16,068
Speaker 0: you know I'm starting to run out of drone parts Even though I tried to get as many as I could and anytime I had an option to like trade missiles for drone parts I did so.

46
00:02:16,472 --> 00:02:17,160
Speaker 0: such like that, right?

47
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:22,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I'm going along with my drone parts and I you know I got a weapon to accompany my own cannon and things are going.

48
00:02:22,739 --> 00:02:37,992
Speaker 0: nice I'm I just I can blow through the regular game up until the boss a hundred percent easily every time on easy no matter what right but Throughout this game for I was like, I really need that thing that you know The drone the drone part collector.

49
00:02:38,073 --> 00:02:41,972
Speaker 0: so I have to so I can stop buying Every time I get that I.

50
00:02:43,121 --> 00:02:46,559
Speaker 1: Somehow that means I'll have like 80 drone parts by the end.

51
00:02:46,909 --> 00:02:50,726
Speaker 0: Yeah But it's better than having to spend Scrap on drone part.

52
00:02:50,746 --> 00:02:55,160
Speaker 1: you only need that if you're doing what I'm doing where you're busting out like three drones every fight.

53
00:02:55,261 --> 00:02:56,046
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was dry.

54
00:02:56,066 --> 00:02:58,080
Speaker 0: I was busting out like two three drones every fight.

55
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:02,074
Speaker 0: I actually found another anti-ship drone, but I never found the drone collect II thing.

56
00:03:02,114 --> 00:03:13,967
Speaker 0: and then of course You know by the end of the game I had my shields all the way up But I didn't have my engines up as much as I wanted because I had to spend so much scrap on freaking drone parts Right.

57
00:03:14,188 --> 00:03:18,732
Speaker 0: Well, don't use the drones as much But I had to to kill the bad guys.

58
00:03:18,773 --> 00:03:20,140
Speaker 1: No, you gotta have some regular weapons.

59
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:27,539
Speaker 0: I did have regular weapons, but the other problem was is I had to to power all three drones simultaneously Which I knew I was gonna need to beat the boss.

60
00:03:29,022 --> 00:03:33,180
Speaker 0: I needed to upgrade the drone section to hold six energy random aside.

61
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,560
Speaker 0: We gotta add six energy to the thing.

62
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:39,225
Speaker 1: I gotta isolate that simultaneously grab and make a.

63
00:03:39,325 --> 00:03:45,183
Speaker 0: so because I had to put so much of my scrap into upgrading the drone section and buying drones I Wasn't able.

64
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:49,240
Speaker 0: I actually picked up like a crazy awesome weapon, but it required for energy.

65
00:03:49,421 --> 00:03:51,749
Speaker 0: I got the weapon for free and I could did.

66
00:03:51,789 --> 00:03:53,816
Speaker 0: there was impossible to power that weapon.

67
00:03:53,896 --> 00:03:54,860
Speaker 1: What do you saw that screenshot?

68
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,928
Speaker 1: I had like four fucking giant weapons.

69
00:03:57,048 --> 00:03:59,820
Speaker 0: It was not possible to power all that stuff.

70
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:04,680
Speaker 0: No The way you didn't get it up straight is I lost all that scrap to buying.

71
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,934
Speaker 1: You're like power down those engines and oxygen and then power up the weapons.

72
00:04:08,974 --> 00:04:12,332
Speaker 0: do a big burst if that You know and then of course I can.

73
00:04:12,413 --> 00:04:13,180
Speaker 0: I get to the end of the game.

74
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:16,434
Speaker 0: I fight the boss, but I can't beat him because they can't power all the things.

75
00:04:16,454 --> 00:04:19,926
Speaker 0: and then right I died the boss.

76
00:04:19,946 --> 00:04:22,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I've never used crew teleporter against the boss.

77
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,205
Speaker 1: I want to try that.

78
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:25,120
Speaker 0: cuz I think I did and you know what happened.

79
00:04:25,604 --> 00:04:27,420
Speaker 0: It was actually working really awesome.

80
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,163
Speaker 1: You know what I do.

81
00:04:28,224 --> 00:04:31,780
Speaker 1: what I want to do is send got like a rock man into like the weapon pod.

82
00:04:32,202 --> 00:04:34,613
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was working really awesomely.

83
00:04:34,633 --> 00:04:41,180
Speaker 0: right in the first go I just shredded him up right and in the second go I sent him over there and I was also shredding him up.

84
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,931
Speaker 1: I want like but then boarding drone.

85
00:04:43,072 --> 00:04:44,059
Speaker 0: it only took.

86
00:04:44,743 --> 00:04:46,452
Speaker 0: Drones would be a lot better for boarding drone.

87
00:04:46,472 --> 00:04:46,794
Speaker 0: No, ain't.

88
00:04:48,642 --> 00:04:56,123
Speaker 0: But then I just fucked up a little bit right like one slip up and suddenly your teleporter is broken and you're trying to Repair it.

89
00:04:56,424 --> 00:04:59,500
Speaker 0: but then you got to repair your oxygen because your ship is gonna die.

90
00:05:00,544 --> 00:05:02,591
Speaker 0: So then suddenly you're scrambling to fix your ship.

91
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:05,320
Speaker 0: Meanwhile, your two guys are suffocating over in the boss.

92
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,711
Speaker 1: She's got you know what and then it's all right now.

93
00:05:07,792 --> 00:05:09,500
Speaker 1: I know how all those other ships felt.

94
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:13,529
Speaker 0: I basically I can get to the boss almost 100% of the time on easy 99% of the time.

95
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:18,864
Speaker 0: I Had it all set up.

96
00:05:18,904 --> 00:05:20,409
Speaker 0: I had the drone collecti bit.

97
00:05:20,469 --> 00:05:22,858
Speaker 0: I had three anti-ship drones.

98
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:23,380
Speaker 0: I had plenty of.

99
00:05:24,784 --> 00:05:27,531
Speaker 1: Get rid of the drone collecti bullshit and put something else there.

100
00:05:27,571 --> 00:05:29,556
Speaker 0: There was nothing for sale there.

101
00:05:30,058 --> 00:05:30,860
Speaker 0: There's no shop.

102
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,691
Speaker 1: There's multiple shops before the fat last zone.

103
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:39,997
Speaker 0: There was not a shop that was selling a Augmentation of any kind in the last two lines.

104
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:44,740
Speaker 0: now I was looking for one in the final sector cuz I knew that I didn't need this thing anymore.

105
00:05:44,981 --> 00:05:46,648
Speaker 0: There was not one available.

106
00:05:46,668 --> 00:05:48,374
Speaker 0: All right, and then it was fine.

107
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:49,780
Speaker 0: I beat the first section of the boss.

108
00:05:49,841 --> 00:05:53,625
Speaker 0: I'd be the second section of the boss easily but then the third section.

109
00:05:53,645 --> 00:06:06,251
Speaker 0: I had so little small amount of hull and no way to repair it because the randomness of the map drawing in the final sector Right put all three repairs next to the base.

110
00:06:06,452 --> 00:06:08,638
Speaker 1: I've never bothered with repairs.

111
00:06:08,738 --> 00:06:19,035
Speaker 0: and then No, but not only that in order to fly to the boss I had to fly through two of the repairs wasting them when I was already fully healed.

112
00:06:19,477 --> 00:06:21,104
Speaker 1: and then after this I just wait.

113
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:24,604
Speaker 1: there's an option to not jump just wait Hold on.

114
00:06:25,226 --> 00:06:26,050
Speaker 0: I can't just wait.

115
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,677
Speaker 0: you have to go out to fight the boss.

116
00:06:27,717 --> 00:06:28,299
Speaker 1: He'll come to you.

117
00:06:28,683 --> 00:06:30,240
Speaker 0: No, you can't just wait at the base.

118
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:34,000
Speaker 0: You have to go out at least a little bit go out a little bit and then wait a little bit.

119
00:06:34,141 --> 00:06:35,386
Speaker 0: I had to immediately.

120
00:06:35,426 --> 00:06:41,039
Speaker 0: the only physical star I could go to was the repair star And was because of the random generation.

121
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:44,488
Speaker 0: I'm telling you this there was no way to go.

122
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:49,731
Speaker 0: I in or the only way out of the base was through a minimum of Two repair stars got it.

123
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:50,859
Speaker 0: You know other way to go.

124
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:54,660
Speaker 1: You're not being trolled if someone flipped like the bullshit bit on your computer.

125
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,832
Speaker 0: I'm telling you because I have not it.

126
00:06:57,073 --> 00:06:58,260
Speaker 1: we need to play this together.

127
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:07,000
Speaker 1: We need to do a Dave and Joel style stream of like this have Every time there is some like one random bullshit that prevents me from beating the boss.

128
00:07:07,161 --> 00:07:10,533
Speaker 1: Meanwhile I play every time and it's like hey, I'm a rock man.

129
00:07:10,573 --> 00:07:11,437
Speaker 1: I'd like to join your crew.

130
00:07:11,517 --> 00:07:11,658
Speaker 1: Hey.

131
00:07:11,698 --> 00:07:12,300
Speaker 0: I'm a rock man.

132
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,689
Speaker 0: I like yeah, you know what happens to me.

133
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:13,870

Speaker 0: I'm a rock man like to join your crew awesome.

135
00:07:15,481 --> 00:07:17,234
Speaker 0: Hey, I'm a mantis like to join your crew awesome.

136
00:07:17,617 --> 00:07:19,624
Speaker 0: Hey There's an old man.

137
00:07:19,645 --> 00:07:22,357
Speaker 0: Would you like to try to bring him up to join your crew?

138
00:07:22,457 --> 00:07:23,120
Speaker 0: and I'm like hell.

139
00:07:23,341 --> 00:07:23,562
Speaker 0: You know.

140
00:07:23,582 --> 00:07:28,140
Speaker 0: I know this doesn't work sometimes, but how can I pass up a possibly free crew member yes?

141
00:07:28,341 --> 00:07:32,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, not only does he die he kills one of your crew members who went to get him restart.

142
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,335
Speaker 1: So the saddest thing that ever happened.

143
00:07:34,355 --> 00:07:35,120
Speaker 1: it happened recently.

144
00:07:35,422 --> 00:07:37,780
Speaker 1: I was trying the whole like teleporting crew thing in this game.

145
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:38,443
Speaker 1: I didn't finish.

146
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:44,452
Speaker 1: so I teleport most of my crew over to the enemy ship and they're fucking it up And everything's going great, and then out of nowhere.

147
00:07:44,492 --> 00:07:45,839
Speaker 1: It's like they're charging up their FTL.

148
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:48,390
Speaker 0: So you gotta shoot you gotta shoot the pilot so they can't go.

149
00:07:48,410 --> 00:07:49,173
Speaker 1: so I pause.

150
00:07:49,233 --> 00:07:50,157
Speaker 1: I'm like no biggie.

151
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,420
Speaker 1: No biggie No, I couldn't teleport him back because I'd been ion hit.

152
00:07:53,822 --> 00:07:58,725
Speaker 1: But I put two ion cannons at the pilot And I targeted the engine.

153
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:00,851
Speaker 1: and just it happened to be chance.

154
00:08:01,433 --> 00:08:08,095
Speaker 1: three full sets of volleys all Missed and then the ship disappeared with my entire crew.

155
00:08:08,336 --> 00:08:12,476
Speaker 0: yeah, there's a video I watched showing final boss strategy and this guy.

156
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:23,600
Speaker 0: he had stealth He had full shield he had crazy awesome burst lasers right and he had the the hull beam right and his strategy Was this seems pretty good genius strategy?

157
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,307
Speaker 0: He had right he was operating.

158
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:28,760
Speaker 0: he was using the real-time nature of the game right to his advantage.

159
00:08:29,103 --> 00:08:30,617
Speaker 0: What he would do is he would go up against the boss.

160
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:33,933
Speaker 0: When the boss is that he would pause all the time like crazy.

161
00:08:34,294 --> 00:08:37,827
Speaker 0: if the boss was about to fire That's when he'd activate the stuff right.

162
00:08:38,048 --> 00:08:43,188
Speaker 0: so all the missiles passed over him when he had all of his way Wasn't auto firing either.

163
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:51,569
Speaker 0: when all his weapons were charged He would fire all the beams all at once like doo doo doo doo doom And if they all hit the shield would be down to nothing.

164
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,528
Speaker 0: and then you would you have it paused already because he basically be Like fire.

165
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:57,082
Speaker 0: pause Right.

166
00:08:57,363 --> 00:09:06,362
Speaker 0: if the shields were 100% down you immediately fire the hull beam in this really precise way that did as much damage as humanly possible across like Multiple.

167
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:10,374
Speaker 1: that's the only reason I use beam weapons because I really like drawing that line right.

168
00:09:10,394 --> 00:09:12,220
Speaker 0: so he draws that line perfectly every time.

169
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,866
Speaker 0: So he does for the maximum effect.

170
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:14,889
Speaker 1: You know it's weird.

171
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:24,360
Speaker 1: There's a few things that really get me going in games, and it's basically Maximizing damage with the mechanic literally like one pixel of the line is in one section of the other guy.

172
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:29,915
Speaker 0: So that an inventory Tetris, so then you know it worked most of the time right.

173
00:09:29,955 --> 00:09:35,758
Speaker 0: and if the if the if the burst weapons Didn't break through the shield he would just sort of keep defending until the next.

174
00:09:35,818 --> 00:09:40,331
Speaker 0: you know Chant when I can tell the weapons were charged again And he just kept doing this and it totally worked.

175
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:42,380
Speaker 0: and it totally worked, and I was like this is genius.

176
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,366
Speaker 0: How could he lose with this?

177
00:09:43,467 --> 00:09:45,359
Speaker 0: and then of course random bullshit up?

178
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:51,580
Speaker 0: And all the drones come out of the boss and his stealth wasn't charged yet, and that's the problem.

179
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:54,051
Speaker 0: Don't use fucking stealth, but he also had max shields.

180
00:09:54,493 --> 00:10:01,540
Speaker 1: It wasn't like fuck stealth Stealth or four crazy weapons and three drones all the same.

181
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,945
Speaker 0: He had all that he had.

182
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:05,334
Speaker 0: you should see he had everything you need to have.

183
00:10:05,394 --> 00:10:07,442
Speaker 0: it's just random bullshit I don't know.

184
00:10:07,602 --> 00:10:13,056
Speaker 1: I win the majority of the times that play on easy and normal is not that hard either.

185
00:10:13,076 --> 00:10:15,928
Speaker 1: It's bullshit anyway.

186
00:10:18,241 --> 00:10:19,306
Speaker 0: He's already did a show on this.

187
00:10:19,688 --> 00:10:21,296
Speaker 0: so here's that ism gaming news.

Speaker 1: I Don't use the Xbox for anything else, and I'm not gonna renew my xbox gold.

202
00:11:26,684 --> 00:11:29,352
Speaker 1: an Xbox over PC no Xbox.

203
00:11:29,412 --> 00:11:35,140
Speaker 0: if you're one of those dumb people who doesn't have a computer attached to your television Yeah, but then I can't play it on my laptop.

204
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:37,105
Speaker 0: It's like people don't have this.

205
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:37,627
Speaker 0: you know.

206
00:11:37,687 --> 00:11:42,247
Speaker 0: realization that like it's like oh, I want to play it on my TV So I'm gonna get an Xbox.

207
00:11:42,287 --> 00:11:45,606
Speaker 0: even the angry video game nerd was like yeah I don't like emulators cuz they can't blame.

208
00:11:45,626 --> 00:11:48,198
Speaker 0: my team will plug a fucking computer in your TV like a normal person.

209
00:11:48,218 --> 00:11:56,400
Speaker 1: how many times You have to say this In my entire life, and I'll be perfectly honest as a hardcore gamer as all these things in my entire life.

210
00:11:56,400 --> 00:12:00,770
Speaker 1: I have maybe two or three regrets in Everything I've ever done in the last 30 years.

211
00:12:01,493 --> 00:12:03,360
Speaker 1: one of them is buying an Xbox 360.

212
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,072
Speaker 0: I don't necessarily regret it, but it's like I regret it.

213
00:12:06,132 --> 00:12:08,040
Speaker 0: I would have been fine not doing so.

214
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,212
Speaker 1: I would rather have owned Super Street Fighter 4 on the computer.

215
00:12:11,392 --> 00:12:11,874
Speaker 0: Yeah, well.

216
00:12:11,894 --> 00:12:13,360
Speaker 0: I don't think it's super on the computer.

217
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,780
Speaker 0: I don't know regular is on the computer.

218
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,320
Speaker 1: I would have been okay with not owning the game as much as I'm really pac-man.

219
00:12:18,461 --> 00:12:18,884
Speaker 0: I just like.

220
00:12:18,925 --> 00:12:23,067
Speaker 0: I wouldn't want to live without that pac-man But I haven't played that pac-man in months.

221
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:28,714
Speaker 0: that pac-man is not worth the amount of money in Xbox costs even though That pac-man.

222
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:29,139
Speaker 0: oh my god.

223
00:12:30,881 --> 00:12:42,899
Speaker 1: Seriously though I'm way excited about Monaco because the version of this game that we played at Pax - over two years ago was already enough for me to throw like 40 bucks at him.

224
00:12:44,421 --> 00:12:56,360
Speaker 1: So I can't imagine what it's like now, but I can because at the last packs where I saw it I didn't play it, but every time I walked by that booth the people standing at the booth were screaming while they were playing.

225
00:12:57,201 --> 00:12:59,410
Speaker 0: I've only ever seen that booth crowded and screaming.

226
00:12:59,571 --> 00:13:01,680
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's just people yelling and screaming and curse.

227
00:13:01,862 --> 00:13:03,780
Speaker 1: Oh my god the game looks so good.

228
00:13:04,394 --> 00:13:05,843
Speaker 1: so Xcom.

229
00:13:06,063 --> 00:13:08,715
Speaker 1: as you all know the new xcom is out, but it's 50 bucks.

230
00:13:08,756 --> 00:13:09,278
Speaker 0: fuck that.

231
00:13:09,619 --> 00:13:13,112
Speaker 1: now The thing is the game is probably worth 50 bucks.

232
00:13:13,212 --> 00:13:23,859
Speaker 0: play the demo not worth 50 bucks But it is xcom now a lot easier to play too because the interface is modern It's interesting and it says a lot about the game industry.

233
00:13:23,879 --> 00:13:29,665
Speaker 1: now It's funny because I what I'm about to say is basically the same thing I was saying about anime.

234
00:13:29,685 --> 00:13:33,236
Speaker 0: in the same thing you say about everything not everything, but anime.

235
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:33,757
Speaker 1: in 2005 you're consistent.

236
00:13:35,062 --> 00:13:39,842
Speaker 1: When in 2005 I was like yeah, X is a really good show X being pot You know.

237
00:13:40,184 --> 00:13:46,427
Speaker 1: and I guess I should say I don't want to talk about X the anime But you know why.

238
00:13:46,447 --> 00:13:47,571
Speaker 1: I guess that's also an anime.

239
00:13:47,772 --> 00:13:48,996
Speaker 0: no East is the east.

240
00:13:49,076 --> 00:13:49,899
Speaker 0: wow is pronounced.

241
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:54,763
Speaker 1: I see wanderers for me anyway, so I Like a show a lot.

242
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:56,851
Speaker 1: I would consider a show like the count of money.

243
00:13:56,871 --> 00:13:58,155
Speaker 1: crystal was an excellent example.

244
00:13:58,195 --> 00:13:59,580
Speaker 1: that show was great.

245
00:13:59,721 --> 00:14:01,932
Speaker 1: It was like a b-plus a-minus anime.

246
00:14:01,992 --> 00:14:09,771
Speaker 1: I love the shit out of it and the DVD box that came out and Later, I saw it on sale on Amazon for like six bucks.

247
00:14:10,032 --> 00:14:18,638
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I looked at I'm like holy shit six bucks Didn't even fucking buy it.

248
00:14:20,002 --> 00:14:38,720
Speaker 1: so as xcom is like one of the poster childs of a game made in 1994 that somehow in all these years no one was able to remake correctly until Xcom is one of the formative games of my life.

249
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:43,456
Speaker 0: It's your jam one of my favorite common bands who ever buy on a commando.

250
00:14:43,476 --> 00:14:44,500
Speaker 0: Those are rims three jams.

251
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,953
Speaker 1: So let's name all the xcom games 1994 xcom enemy unknown.

252
00:14:47,993 --> 00:14:49,659
Speaker 1: the real one one of the best games ever.

253
00:14:49,659 --> 00:14:52,693
Speaker 1: 1995 xcom terror from the deep shit.

254
00:14:53,276 --> 00:14:54,120
Speaker 1: xcom apocalypse.

255
00:14:55,101 --> 00:14:57,949
Speaker 1: Xcom interceptor not even an xcom game.

256
00:14:58,451 --> 00:15:00,056
Speaker 1: xcom first alien in big.

257
00:15:00,276 --> 00:15:01,360
Speaker 1: seriously has bro.

258
00:15:02,022 --> 00:15:04,047
Speaker 1: Xcom enforcer I've never even heard of.

259
00:15:04,067 --> 00:15:05,712
Speaker 0: that's a third-person shooter.

260
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:07,176
Speaker 0: That's the worst xcom.

261
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:14,197
Speaker 1: Genesis was cancelled As was xcom Alliance and then xcom enemy unknown.

262
00:15:14,237 --> 00:15:19,237
Speaker 0: in 2012 I think there was actually one that was I think was excellent.

263
00:15:19,257 --> 00:15:19,840
Speaker 0: apocalypse.

264
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,711
Speaker 0: Maybe was the one that was closest the closest.

265
00:15:22,751 --> 00:15:27,011
Speaker 0: it actually played like the original xcom But it was some more modern.

266
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:27,594
Speaker 0: It just didn't.

267
00:15:27,715 --> 00:15:28,560
Speaker 1: it was not a good.

268
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,931
Speaker 0: It was not as good as it did any.

269
00:15:29,992 --> 00:15:31,020
Speaker 0: it didn't have the base part.

270
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:45,780
Speaker 1: It was just the base parts the only part I care about right, but anyway, so despite even not you know That's not even counting the like dozen open source like attempts by game people to make the unreal tournament mod laser.

271
00:15:46,902 --> 00:15:49,631
Speaker 0: They were all awful and no one finished working on any of them.

272
00:15:49,792 --> 00:15:52,280
Speaker 1: so thus the conundrum of the gaming industry.

273
00:15:52,665 --> 00:15:53,699
Speaker 1: We gave a lecture at PAX.

274
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:59,179
Speaker 1: We don't have a video of a long time ago called egregiously unrealized potential where we talked about like how?

275
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,769
Speaker 1: Games like xcom or chrono trigger.

276
00:16:01,789 --> 00:16:04,179
Speaker 1: just nobody fucking remakes and nobody just does it right.

277
00:16:04,339 --> 00:16:04,862
Speaker 0: well They did.

278
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:08,257
Speaker 1: it's like people don't understand the essence of what made these games good.

279
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:20,795
Speaker 1: and here It is a perfect example of just doing exactly what I've been saying people should do for a decade And I can't be asked to pay 50 bucks for it's a lot of fucking money.

280
00:16:20,835 --> 00:16:22,020
Speaker 0: buying a commando rearm.

281
00:16:22,341 --> 00:16:24,729
Speaker 0: It was 20 I 50 bucks.

282
00:16:24,849 --> 00:16:27,940
Speaker 1: I'll blow that on dinner and not even think but that's dinner.

283
00:16:29,581 --> 00:16:30,806
Speaker 1: Also, this is my jam.

284
00:16:30,826 --> 00:16:32,272
Speaker 1: I don't know.

285
00:16:32,292 --> 00:16:34,300
Speaker 0: a lot of money for xcom.

286
00:16:34,881 --> 00:16:36,386
Speaker 0: I don't think it is what I mean.

287
00:16:36,426 --> 00:16:37,048
Speaker 0: what video game?

288
00:16:37,068 --> 00:16:43,666
Speaker 1: when I got I paid $70 for Zelda 2 $65 for Mario 3.

289
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,152
Speaker 0: xcom is a single-player game.

290
00:16:45,433 --> 00:16:48,940
Speaker 0: if I bought it or someone gave it to me for free I'd play it through and probably stop playing.

291
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,732
Speaker 0: It's a multiplayer component, but it doesn't seem like a good multi-player component one.

292
00:16:54,752 --> 00:16:55,835
Speaker 0: That's worth playing a lot.

293
00:16:56,136 --> 00:16:57,679
Speaker 1: xcom UFO defense.

294
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,502
Speaker 1: I Pirated.

295
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:01,116
Speaker 1: I didn't pay anything for it.

296
00:17:01,378 --> 00:17:10,777
Speaker 1: in fact It was the first game I ever pirated on purpose, and I played it without an instruction book which was extra awesome, but Like one day I figured out I could duck and I was like oh

297
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,009
Speaker 0: Yeah, but the point is

298
00:17:14,049 --> 00:17:20,068
Speaker 1: but I got maybe I don't know 4,000 hours of entertainment out of that game.

299
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:21,593
Speaker 1: I played it as much as I played.

300
00:17:21,653 --> 00:17:24,564
Speaker 0: sieve fucking - I'm telling you is a Counter-strike.

301
00:17:24,584 --> 00:17:26,494
Speaker 0: global offensive was 14 and change.

302
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:34,439
Speaker 0: So xcom does not hold a candle to that shit, so he can't charge me Multiple times the car.

303
00:17:35,522 --> 00:17:37,753
Speaker 1: But you're saying that not worth 50 bucks.

304
00:17:38,095 --> 00:17:41,085
Speaker 1: Here's my problem 50 bucks the price.

305
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:43,574
Speaker 1: it could be a thousand dollars and have the same discussion.

306
00:17:43,995 --> 00:17:48,167
Speaker 1: the problem is simply Once again, I look at my steam profiler.

307
00:17:48,187 --> 00:17:49,671
Speaker 1: I mean I got steam open right now.

308
00:17:50,112 --> 00:17:52,518
Speaker 1: What games have I never even installed?

309
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:55,308
Speaker 1: most area Battlefield 2 bad company.

310
00:17:55,649 --> 00:17:57,014
Speaker 0: Why do you even buy battlefield?

311
00:17:57,075 --> 00:17:58,360
Speaker 1: I think I got it like a dollar.

312
00:17:58,681 --> 00:18:00,807
Speaker 1: I uninstalled Bioshock and Borderlands.

313
00:18:00,868 --> 00:18:03,576
Speaker 1: I've never actually played braid on this computer.

314
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:10,116
Speaker 1: Dave defeat I don't know how I got that all our three ideas is a half-life 1 mod your grandfathered in.

315
00:18:10,397 --> 00:18:15,571
Speaker 1: I have played Europa Universalis 3 a couple of times couple times Let's see Magica.

316
00:18:15,611 --> 00:18:19,912
Speaker 1: I haven't even installed Machinarium Lugaru loom.

317
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:24,791
Speaker 1: I. I've got enough games to last me a decade right unplayed.

318
00:18:24,811 --> 00:18:25,233
Speaker 1: Yep.

319
00:18:26,055 --> 00:18:31,592
Speaker 0: It's a supply and demand of all Games regardless of what the game is, but this is the problem.

320
00:18:31,712 --> 00:18:41,600
Speaker 1: a game that is both rims Personal direct jam done correctly and done the way he specified well close enough at least won't play it.

321
00:18:42,044 --> 00:18:43,378
Speaker 1: What do we do about this?

322
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:46,146
Speaker 0: Don't charge 50 fucking dollars.

323
00:18:46,286 --> 00:18:47,390
Speaker 1: if it was free.

324
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:50,699
Speaker 0: I still wouldn't be playing it right now, but you would have downloaded it.

325
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,925
Speaker 0: Yeah, I wouldn't be playing it If it was a dollar.

326
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:55,230
Speaker 0: you would have paid the dollar.

327
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,595
Speaker 1: even I wouldn't be playing.

328
00:18:56,615 --> 00:19:00,146
Speaker 0: you still would have paid the dollar And you'd play it eventually.

329
00:19:00,387 --> 00:19:04,219
Speaker 1: what does it take for me to play a game that isn't Counter-Strike?

330
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:10,971
Speaker 1: I mean it might take a New advanced wars on a computer.

331
00:19:10,991 --> 00:19:12,979
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, I might do it.

332
00:19:15,805 --> 00:19:16,208
Speaker 1: Anyway, you know.

333
00:19:16,228 --> 00:19:18,000
Speaker 1: sort of brief news that we can go on.

334
00:19:19,581 --> 00:19:21,269
Speaker 0: So another thing it takes to get someone.

335
00:19:21,289 --> 00:19:23,580
Speaker 0: I mean you're gonna you would play it eventually, right?

336
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,996
Speaker 0: The question really is what would it take to get you to play the game now, right?

337
00:19:27,924 --> 00:19:28,920
Speaker 0: To get to play the game now.

338
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:35,759
Speaker 0: There has to be a reason to play it now as opposed to at some point later in my life Which means there needs to be some sort of?

339
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:43,316
Speaker 0: multiplayer Community some some component where playing it this instant is actually different like tribes do.

340
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,639
Speaker 0: if you didn't play it when it came out Well, you didn't play now.

341
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:53,040
Speaker 1: It's interesting is that there was a time Like when Dave's X came out human revolution a lot of the people I talked to and hang out with on the internet.

342
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:54,139
Speaker 1: We're all playing it right away.

343
00:19:54,623 --> 00:19:56,980
Speaker 1: So I was missing out on that and when I finally played it.

344
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,713
Speaker 0: I don't know why people are so concerned missing out on no.

345
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:06,670
Speaker 0: No, I'm missing out on the talking The shared Experience and dialogue of like.

346
00:20:07,011 --> 00:20:09,180
Speaker 1: like like the Dave and Joel it hasn't gone anywhere.

347
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:13,680
Speaker 0: Those people still had that experience and still remember it and you can talk about it with them later when you have it.

348
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:16,499
Speaker 1: Also, yeah, and then it becomes like our crew where we want it.

349
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:21,760
Speaker 1: You know someone else starts reading The Prince of Nothing and wants to talk about and everyone else is like fuck.

350
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,526
Speaker 0: Talk about that anytime.

351
00:20:25,064 --> 00:20:37,049
Speaker 1: But anyway, let's talk about it right now, but now Most of the people I talked to online except for the people who don't have jobs or are still in college or Don't have anything else going on.

352
00:20:37,672 --> 00:20:41,905
Speaker 1: They're the only ones who play single-player games Except Dave and Joel, I guess.

353
00:20:42,587 --> 00:20:45,596
Speaker 0: well, you know game reviewer type people and stuff like that.

354
00:20:45,616 --> 00:20:46,700
Speaker 1: We're game reviewer type people.

355
00:20:47,822 --> 00:20:48,951
Speaker 0: We're not paid to do it.

356
00:20:49,031 --> 00:20:53,080
Speaker 1: nor is it our primary Argue that most people are not effectively paid to do it.

357
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,665
Speaker 0: Well, imagine this right rim.

358
00:20:54,705 --> 00:20:59,240
Speaker 0: if we didn't if we didn't care about anime manga comics technology or anything.

359
00:20:59,341 --> 00:21:02,175
Speaker 0: But video games now board games no role-playing games.

360
00:21:02,195 --> 00:21:05,740
Speaker 0: I Imagine we would be paying 50 bucks for xcom and doing alright.

361
00:21:06,103 --> 00:21:09,344
Speaker 0: And I think there's just a lot of people out there that you know We interact with.

362
00:21:09,404 --> 00:21:15,973
Speaker 0: and you sort of forget that these people, you know They might dabble in some comics and read some webcomics.

363
00:21:15,993 --> 00:21:20,460
Speaker 0: so they might you know, but it's like they're Mostly in video games, right?

364
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:26,400
Speaker 0: It's like that is you know, if you if you divide made a little percentage chart of like how much of them is each geekery?

365
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,576
Speaker 0: It's like, you know video games would be over 50 60 percent.

366
00:21:29,636 --> 00:21:29,958
Speaker 0: Well, it is.

367
00:21:31,801 --> 00:21:33,105
Speaker 0: It's more even ways.

368
00:21:33,165 --> 00:21:34,609
Speaker 0: it's like 25 25 15 10, right?

369
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:36,375
Speaker 0: There's nothing.

370
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:40,208
Speaker 0: there's no hot geekery that I have That's even over 25%.

371
00:21:40,208 --> 00:21:44,163
Speaker 1: so yeah, but I guess case in point look at Otakon the.

372
00:21:44,404 --> 00:21:49,854
Speaker 1: you know, we were guests of Otakon doing lectures for almost a decade and We did a lot of them.

373
00:21:49,874 --> 00:21:51,262
Speaker 1: one year We did like five.

374
00:21:51,804 --> 00:21:59,359
Speaker 1: the biggest and most popular thing we ever did at an Otakon was beyond Dungeons and Dragons.

375
00:22:00,281 --> 00:22:04,719
Speaker 1: Gaming is the most popular thing at the biggest anime convention in America.

376
00:22:05,421 --> 00:22:06,745
Speaker 1: Mmm, it says a lot.

377
00:22:06,785 --> 00:22:08,790
Speaker 1: I think that says more about anime than about gaming now.

378
00:22:10,901 --> 00:22:17,610
Speaker 1: So anyway very briefly, you know, the New York Comic Con happened and as you know, we didn't go for the first time For the second time.

379
00:22:17,650 --> 00:22:18,640
Speaker 0: we didn't go to the very first one.

380
00:22:18,748 --> 00:22:22,552
Speaker 1: Yeah We couldn't though that the guests could go to the first one to go to the first.

381
00:22:22,572 --> 00:22:26,239
Speaker 1: the guests of the convention could not get Into the first New York Comic Con.

382
00:22:26,923 --> 00:22:31,080
Speaker 1: But no I went to everyone after that and I did not go to this one despite having a free badge.

383
00:22:31,785 --> 00:22:37,936
Speaker 1: And it's interesting that when I looked over You know the comic part of it had some interesting stuff going on, but anime is gone.

384
00:22:37,956 --> 00:22:42,314
Speaker 1: There's no anime there and Gaming is also gone.

385
00:22:43,642 --> 00:22:49,178
Speaker 1: Yeah, based on the online coverage right a lot of the kind of show has been replaced by TV.

386
00:22:51,964 --> 00:22:53,079
Speaker 1: It's SDCC light.

387
00:22:53,381 --> 00:22:55,890
Speaker 0: Yeah, so but looking at the online coverage it's.

388
00:22:55,930 --> 00:23:00,713
Speaker 0: they showed a clip of the first episode of ponies Which I got to see on the internet.

389
00:23:00,813 --> 00:23:04,859
Speaker 0: Yep, and to There was.

390
00:23:05,722 --> 00:23:06,185
Speaker 0: There was this.

391
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:07,251
Speaker 0: I think there's the usual.

392
00:23:07,292 --> 00:23:10,399
Speaker 0: the Gundam booth is always awesome But someone took pictures of every Gundam in it.

393
00:23:10,501 --> 00:23:16,257
Speaker 1: So there was like this e-level mezzanine where all the anime kids and all the people who sit on the floor at cons sat on the floor right.

394
00:23:16,678 --> 00:23:20,535
Speaker 0: and then the only thing that I could tell from the internet that I missed at this

395
00:23:20,595 --> 00:23:20,977
Speaker 1: con

396
00:23:21,218 --> 00:23:21,539
Speaker 0: right is

397
00:23:22,681 --> 00:23:26,339
Speaker 1: the security line because now they were searching bags to let people in that

398
00:23:26,359 --> 00:23:45,700
Speaker 0: and Be if you read bakuman There is a manga within the manga of bakuman no dog called ocelot number an otter number 11 and they had there they were giving away Otter number 11 like the spin-off which is sort of the same.

399
00:23:45,881 --> 00:23:48,100
Speaker 0: It's sort of the same ideas like kuji biki unbalanced.

400
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:48,441
Speaker 1: You know.

401
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:54,160
Speaker 1: you could do Scott if you really wanted it because way back when I I could easily get it if I wanted to.

402
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:57,120
Speaker 1: Yes, yeah, cuz when I really wanted that that pit boy.

403
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:05,280
Speaker 0: Multiple listeners send me their pit boys if anyone's gonna copy about her number 11 It makes Scott really don't even need to send it to me.

404
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:08,980
Speaker 0: Just scan it in and send me some JPEGs or send me a link to the JPEGs or whatever.

405
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:09,723
Speaker 0: I just want to read it.

406
00:24:09,743 --> 00:24:10,686
Speaker 0: I don't need to have it.

407
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:15,022
Speaker 0: I don't need more shit my house, but I don't know It's just.

408
00:24:15,243 --> 00:24:26,143
Speaker 1: it's interesting because I had some conversations with a lot of different people related to the or comic-con a couple years ago And the sentiment then was very directly Increased.

409
00:24:26,184 --> 00:24:29,280
Speaker 1: the gaming industry and gaming content at the New York comic-con.

410
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:41,500
Speaker 1: There was a big internal push for that and then all those people one by one Stop talking about it with me and then stop talking to me and then all the gaming content of the New York comic-con disappeared.

411
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:49,920
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I know those Watson is still there though And I'm pretty sure there's still a few booths that belong to various games like a crane was there.

412
00:24:50,000 --> 00:25:00,778
Speaker 1: but the gaming content at the New York comic-con has diminished substantially and As opposed to increase dramatically, which was what people specifically said they were going to do.

413
00:25:00,818 --> 00:25:04,992
Speaker 1: So I'm curious Who at read pop made the call of you know what?

414
00:25:05,373 --> 00:25:06,960
Speaker 1: Let's just try to be a shit here.

415
00:25:07,502 --> 00:25:11,036
Speaker 0: I guess they don't want to overlap with packs and they want to make money.

416
00:25:11,116 --> 00:25:11,980
Speaker 0: right and you think about it.

417
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:17,064
Speaker 0: Well, if we have a booth, yeah a booth selling comics makes more dollars Oh foot.

418
00:25:17,284 --> 00:25:21,500
Speaker 0: then a table for tabletop replay does yeah, which makes zero dollars per square foot.

419
00:25:21,821 --> 00:25:27,080
Speaker 1: But then you have the you know, the interesting incentive of you don't want people to stay in the convention for three days.

420
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:31,380
Speaker 1: You'd rather have three different people come for a few hours on three different day, right?

421
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:37,220
Speaker 0: Because if three different people come then it's you know, that's that's more customers per booth.

422
00:25:37,321 --> 00:25:39,512
Speaker 0: So all the exhibitors will make more money.

423
00:25:39,532 --> 00:25:43,267
Speaker 0: and if the exhibitors make more money You can charge more money for the tables.

424
00:25:43,548 --> 00:25:52,088
Speaker 0: and you know, so it's like oh that comment that guy just selling his comics You know from kind of came in from New Jersey Makes five hundred dollars.

425
00:25:52,149 --> 00:25:54,240
Speaker 0: You can't sell him a table over five hundred dollars.

426
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:57,636
Speaker 0: Anyway, that if he makes five thousand you can sell him a table over one thousand.

427
00:25:57,656 --> 00:25:58,480
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that later.

428
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:08,293
Speaker 1: That's kind of a separate show because it's basically look at packs and Otacon and the New York Comic Con like those three between all three of them show like the three possible directions the convention.

429
00:26:08,333 --> 00:26:13,801
Speaker 0: the one thing about the con is like It's if you want to buy some stuff they have stuff that you know It's.

430
00:26:14,183 --> 00:26:16,133
Speaker 0: I guess it'd be convenient especially because I live here.

431
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:24,200
Speaker 0: but the cost Getting in Outways the cost of you know, makes it not economical to buy anything.

432
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:26,310
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, I'm gonna buy a badge just to buy stuff.

433
00:26:26,351 --> 00:26:28,280
Speaker 0: Oh, maybe they just buy this stuff online.

434
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:35,560
Speaker 1: Maybe this is something really snarky and self-centered to say I kind of forget unless I think about it that conventions cost money.

435
00:26:36,521 --> 00:26:41,200
Speaker 0: It's also think about all these people a lot of people I talked to go to the con.

436
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:52,620
Speaker 0: I even talked to someone who was thinking about just standing outside the con because it's like all they just wanted to do was sort of like, you know Goggle and gaggle at people in costumes at the you know, and it's like we're just so jaded.

437
00:26:52,741 --> 00:26:54,380
Speaker 0: It's not worth anything to us anymore.

438
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:58,377
Speaker 1: But to a lot of if it's it's to a lot of years of Otacon that did that to us.

439
00:26:58,417 --> 00:27:05,424
Speaker 0: to a lot of people they just go to it and just being there and seeing all the nerdiness and costumes and craziness is like Whoa, it's that would.

440
00:27:05,524 --> 00:27:06,849
Speaker 1: it's so fun for them.

441
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:10,220
Speaker 0: But for us that's like you'd have to pay me to do it.

442
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,530
Speaker 0: It's like I've done that so many times.

443
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:15,551
Speaker 1: that would you could not Know value for me whatsoever.

444
00:27:15,572 --> 00:27:20,569
Speaker 1: the people I know who are the most excited about it Don't go to many cons or don't live in New York City.

445
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:24,141
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I realized I mean think about it 2002.

446
00:27:24,141 --> 00:27:28,139
Speaker 1: I went to my first anime convention and my mind was blown.

447

00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:48,647
Speaker 1: It's like oh, hey, it's that inflated thing.

457
00:27:48,667 --> 00:27:50,816
Speaker 1: They had at the other the last 11 conventions.

458
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:51,780
Speaker 1: We attended exactly.

459
00:27:52,041 --> 00:27:57,055
Speaker 1: Yeah, if I even notice it at all, I remember the last New York anime festival that happened.

460
00:27:57,095 --> 00:28:02,620
Speaker 1: We literally showed up Did our lecture and walked out like immediately?

461
00:28:03,481 --> 00:28:09,876
Speaker 0: Someone told me the other I forget who it was maybe a week or two ago and they were like, yeah I was got on this train and these oh it was.

462
00:28:10,178 --> 00:28:18,190
Speaker 0: uh my dad's friend from Connecticut and he talked about how he went to the city for Yankees game and he was on the subway and Some dudes came on the subway and started breakdancing.

463
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:20,119
Speaker 0: and I'm like, why did you even look at them?

464
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:21,972
Speaker 0: And he like he actually gave him money.

465
00:28:22,012 --> 00:28:22,558
Speaker 0: and I'm like what?

466
00:28:23,721 --> 00:28:29,702
Speaker 0: I'm like, dude If that he like people come on and they'll be like a mariachi band on the subway and I don't even know that they were There.

467
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:32,191
Speaker 1: no good thing for those of you don't live in New York.

468
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,640
Speaker 1: That is Scott is not in any way.

469
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,359
Speaker 1: It's not like a I don't know an exaggeration or a silly.

470
00:28:37,741 --> 00:28:50,734
Speaker 1: Literally, it'll be my morning commute and an entire mariachi band of like six people will come from another subway car into my subway car and play an entire song and No one even notices.

471
00:28:51,036 --> 00:28:55,799
Speaker 0: Yep Like if I got my headphones in I might not even know that they I might.

472
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:58,479
Speaker 0: you know It's like I won't react to it usually but I'll notice it.

473
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,540
Speaker 0: I got mariachi band right and just go back to what I was doing and ignore them.

474
00:29:02,903 --> 00:29:10,256
Speaker 0: But like if I got headphones in There's a good chance that they would come in and leave and I would and like I wouldn't even know that they were there in the first place.

475
00:29:19,292 --> 00:29:27,337
Speaker 1: But anyway things of the day Try not to do like pony mashups because you know I've anyone who cares about.

476
00:29:27,377 --> 00:29:30,269
Speaker 1: those have seen them all by this point and Gangnam style.

477
00:29:30,349 --> 00:29:43,630
Speaker 1: I would Is also something that I would say I don't need to do anymore but This is just such an unexpected and unexpectedly delightful mashup.

478
00:29:45,071 --> 00:29:45,975
Speaker 1: It's Ghostbusters.

479
00:29:46,036 --> 00:29:49,030
Speaker 0: It's flawed slightly, but it's still good enough to be awesome.

480
00:29:49,472 --> 00:29:50,134
Speaker 1: It's pretty great.

481
00:29:50,756 --> 00:29:54,148
Speaker 1: And the thing is you're gonna watch it and all you're gonna want to do is watch Ghostbusters again.

482
00:29:54,168 --> 00:30:01,186
Speaker 0: Yeah So imagine if you know you were watching like a cartoon of like Superman, right and Superman went.

483
00:30:01,267 --> 00:30:04,297
Speaker 0: he like flew away Right and he changed his clothes really fast.

484
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:08,956
Speaker 0: Imagine if you're walking down the street and you saw someone do that you would be like No, I wouldn't.

485
00:30:08,976 --> 00:30:09,561
Speaker 1: it's New York.

486
00:30:09,621 --> 00:30:10,670
Speaker 1: I see shit like that every day.

487
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:16,150
Speaker 0: You don't see somebody change their clothes faster than someone could humanly possibly change their clothes and then fly.

488
00:30:16,391 --> 00:30:21,190
Speaker 0: I saw a hobo stripping naked and changing clothes not as fast as Superman nor did he fly afterwards?

489
00:30:22,516 --> 00:30:24,008
Speaker 1: He was lingering a little bit, right?

490
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:27,090
Speaker 0: So imagine if you're walking on the street, you know.

491
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:38,410
Speaker 0: And you saw a cartoon and it was Batman with his little grappling hook going whoosh and then jumping across Buildings that were way too far apart now Grappling hook right for any human being to possibly jump, but he did it anyway, right?

492
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:45,866
Speaker 0: Well, if you saw that happen in real life You'd be and what they weren't using wires or like on a movie set you'd be like, whoa What the fuck even in New York, right?

493
00:30:45,946 --> 00:30:54,648
Speaker 0: Yeah Here's a video of somebody doing something that you would normally consider to be almost superhuman But he actually just does it straight up.

494
00:30:55,412 --> 00:31:03,564
Speaker 0: I'm not really a big fan of playing the game Metal Gear Solid but in Metal Gear Solid I know there was a character and his name is Revolver Ocelot.

495
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,030
Speaker 1: Do you know anything about Revolver Ocelot?

496
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:05,211
Speaker 1: I

497
00:31:05,291 --> 00:31:27,529
Speaker 0: know that he is a dude who is really fucking good with revolvers and he's also a boss in the game and there are many cutscenes in which he spins his revolvers a great deal like whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh in a way that if you watch, you know in the video game where it's just a You know computer-generated graphics right would appear to be basically impossible for a real person to do.

498
00:31:28,651 --> 00:31:30,578
Speaker 0: They are not impossible for real person to do.

499
00:31:30,618 --> 00:31:39,830
Speaker 0: this guy made a YouTube video of him spinning his revolvers and doing the 100% exact same thing the Revolver Ocelot does in the cutscenes of the video game.

500
00:31:40,252 --> 00:31:42,202
Speaker 0: He is a master of revolver spinning.

501
00:31:42,222 --> 00:31:43,710
Speaker 0: He is so good at it.

502
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,429
Speaker 0: He is as good as a fictionally super powered character at doing this.

503
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:49,373
Speaker 1: Good God.

504
00:31:49,433 --> 00:31:53,850
Speaker 1: the article on Revolver Ocelot has 33 citations in Wikipedia, right?

505
00:31:53,910 --> 00:32:00,120
Speaker 0: But the point is that this guy is as good as a fictional Theoretically super powered character at a thing.

506
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:02,750
Speaker 0: Hence my analogies of Superman and Batman.

507
00:32:05,031 --> 00:32:08,284
Speaker 1: So in the meta moment this Friday is the nerd NYC board game night.

530
00:33:17,077 --> 00:33:21,422
Speaker 1: Yep, and You have to run a game to play in a game.

531
00:33:21,482 --> 00:33:23,190
Speaker 1: You can't even attend if you're not running, right?

Speaker 1: So it's gonna be a great time if any of you are going to be there Great time the last two times because we will be there.

535
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:51,590
Speaker 0: I'm running again as I have run many times at events like this into the mountain the arc of Running a scenario that I'm still polishing, you know minds about and it's still not gonna be fully polished.

536
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:53,939
Speaker 0: I'm gonna basically finish polishing it when it's being played.

537
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:57,050
Speaker 1: Mine is about an arc filled with obscenities.

538
00:33:57,877 --> 00:34:06,453
Speaker 0: mine is about a. You're basically a bunch of merchants in a town and this is a knigget and he kills an awesome monster of some kind and has A mad treasure.

539
00:34:06,795 --> 00:34:10,110
Speaker 0: He brings the treasure back to the town and all the merchants fucking want it.

540
00:34:10,531 --> 00:34:15,210
Speaker 1: The last time I ran into the mountain the entire party died, but felt very satisfied.

541
00:34:16,271 --> 00:34:25,670
Speaker 1: The time before that the party destroyed the entire world and the time before that I think they all died screaming Mmm, like I think every one of them was screaming when they died anyway.

542
00:34:26,891 --> 00:34:28,597
Speaker 0: But yeah, I know some burning con.

543
00:34:28,618 --> 00:34:33,609
Speaker 0: a lot of people sort of chicken out because they're afraid to run a game Even if they really know how to play.

544
00:34:34,291 --> 00:34:37,820
Speaker 1: Seriously, I go to a lot of cons man up pussies.

545
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:42,733
Speaker 1: best majority of people who run games at conventions suck Acid.

546
00:34:42,753 --> 00:34:44,762

549
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:51,245
Speaker 1: You will not stand out.

550
00:34:51,344 --> 00:34:52,949
Speaker 0: even the people you think are really good.

551
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:53,954
Speaker 0: No, they suck too.

552
00:34:53,974 --> 00:34:54,797
Speaker 0: There's like said Luke Ryan.

553
00:34:54,817 --> 00:34:55,259
Speaker 1: He's really good.

554
00:34:55,279 --> 00:34:56,784
Speaker 0: It's like three people who are any good.

555
00:34:57,226 --> 00:35:02,756
Speaker 0: Yeah, everyone else sucks also And you know what?

556
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:04,570
Speaker 1: I think I'm pretty shit your shit.

557
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,930
Speaker 0: There's a. I've been told I'm a shit and I thought I was shit.

558
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:11,223
Speaker 0: But then once I was told I was good only one time or two times.

559
00:35:11,344 --> 00:35:21,200
Speaker 1: I was told at the last Two recesses ago three recess some some recess that I ran the best game The one of the people had ever played in a recess ever.

560
00:35:21,501 --> 00:35:23,490
Speaker 1: Anyway, I was very proud of that.

561
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:31,706
Speaker 0: There is a beginners track which I guess you may or may not be able to still sign up for Where you actually spend one day learning in one day playing.

562
00:35:31,746 --> 00:35:32,450
Speaker 0: so that's not too bad.

563
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:36,229
Speaker 0: If you don't know what you do and and you're a pussy, it's gonna be a good time.

00:35:44,998 --> 00:35:45,680
Speaker 0: I don't know whatever.

567

Speaker 0: Anyway, I can't imagine me.

579
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:05,554
Speaker 1: Oh, no the previous one 10-10-10.

580
00:36:05,574 --> 00:36:09,467
Speaker 1: New York comic-con was at the same time right and I went to do some press bullshit.

581
00:36:09,528 --> 00:36:16,246
Speaker 0: Yep Anyway, the book club book is the name of the wind by Patrick Rothfuss.

582
00:36:16,286 --> 00:36:17,410
Speaker 0: I've already finished it.

583
00:36:17,550 --> 00:36:18,578
Speaker 0: How come you haven't finished?

584
00:36:18,739 --> 00:36:20,210
Speaker 1: I just started reading it.

585
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:23,745
Speaker 0: I'm not talking about you and talking about all the use but also you kids.

586
00:36:23,946 --> 00:36:24,890
Speaker 0: you're slow at reading.

587
00:36:25,332 --> 00:36:28,404
Speaker 0: This is why you need to read and not listen to audiobooks.

588
00:36:28,424 --> 00:36:29,790
Speaker 0: You'll get faster and better at reading.

589
00:36:29,951 --> 00:36:31,563
Speaker 1: I am 10% of the way through this book.

590
00:36:31,643 --> 00:36:34,975
Speaker 0: I started it yesterday Thumbs up or thumbs down.

591
00:36:34,995 --> 00:36:36,280
Speaker 1: I'm liking it so far.

592
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:36,922
Speaker 1: So Scott.

593
00:36:36,942 --> 00:36:39,170
Speaker 1: I got one question for you who would win in a fight?

594
00:36:41,362 --> 00:36:42,734
Speaker 0: kvot or I think it's kvothe.

595
00:36:43,356 --> 00:36:44,500
Speaker 0: It's how it's supposed to be pronounced.

596
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,008
Speaker 1: Well, he said it's pronounced similarly to quotes.

597
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:48,126
Speaker 0: Yeah quote.

598
00:36:49,976 --> 00:36:50,803
Speaker 0: I think it's close.

599
00:36:51,005 --> 00:36:51,328
Speaker 1: You know what?

600
00:36:52,270 --> 00:36:54,968
Speaker 0: kvothe reshy sure the guy.

601
00:36:55,029 --> 00:36:57,486
Speaker 1: so There's some things I can say early on.

602
00:36:58,151 --> 00:37:03,146
Speaker 1: Getting some slightly homoerotic vibes from him and his student in the early parts of the book.

603
00:37:03,367 --> 00:37:06,257
Speaker 1: Okay, whatever whatever I'm just saying getting some vibes there.

604
00:37:06,297 --> 00:37:14,160
Speaker 1: Yeah, those vibes to chronicler reminds me a lot of Danilothon from the some frog out in the realms books.

605
00:37:14,180 --> 00:37:15,404
Speaker 0: Well, I don't know that character.

606
00:37:15,464 --> 00:37:16,668
Speaker 1: No, but he's a lot like that guy.

607
00:37:16,688 --> 00:37:21,029
Speaker 1: Okay Three who would win in a fight kvothe or Kellis?

608
00:37:22,594 --> 00:37:23,423
Speaker 0: kvothe or Kellis?

609
00:37:23,464 --> 00:37:27,017
Speaker 0: Yeah Kellis, it depends.

610
00:37:27,038 --> 00:37:40,982
Speaker 0: Yeah, because yeah, it depends because Of course this but these books right all three of them only two of which are out are the story of kvothe from his youth to his older days.

611
00:37:41,002 --> 00:37:45,941
Speaker 1: Yeah, because kvothe could kill like kvothe when he was just one of the enemaru.

612
00:37:46,042 --> 00:37:51,703
Speaker 0: It's like at it's edmera I think but it's like which point in each of their lives, right?

613
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:53,510
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, who's gonna win in a fight?

614
00:37:53,891 --> 00:37:55,517
Speaker 0: Merlin or Lancelot?

615
00:37:55,557 --> 00:38:03,410
Speaker 0: Well Merlin probably right, but no, it's super old Merlin Who's actually a baby versus super young Merlin who's a knicket with swords and lances?

616
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,820
Speaker 0: I think baby Merlin is gonna lose right.

617
00:38:06,142 --> 00:38:06,645
Speaker 0: so you got it.

618
00:38:06,665 --> 00:38:07,570
Speaker 0: You got to pick a time.

619
00:38:07,710 --> 00:38:09,598
Speaker 1: Well the same time it depends on how.

620
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:12,490
Speaker 0: we also don't know the full timeline of either character.

621
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:15,919
Speaker 1: Does kvothe have the mark like?

622
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,262
Speaker 1: well also kvothe.

623
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:18,526
Speaker 1: there's a lot of names.

624
00:38:18,786 --> 00:38:20,210
Speaker 0: I know you mean coty.

625
00:38:24,492 --> 00:38:25,535
Speaker 1: This book likes to throw.

626
00:38:25,556 --> 00:38:31,922
Speaker 1: I like that this when he starts telling the story and he's like three days and then he's like Some may know me as he starts listing.

627
00:38:31,962 --> 00:38:37,442
Speaker 1: like all these names The bloodless King killer have to do one damage, right?

628
00:38:37,483 --> 00:38:39,910
Speaker 0: Yeah, but book one is day one book Tuesday to book Thursday.

629
00:38:40,291 --> 00:38:40,693
Speaker 1: I'm liking it.

630
00:38:40,793 --> 00:38:41,115
Speaker 1: Okay.

631
00:38:41,215 --> 00:38:43,584
Speaker 1: It's not as artfully put together as the Prince of Nothing.

632
00:38:43,645 --> 00:38:44,990
Speaker 1: Nor is it is deeply philosophical.

633
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,150
Speaker 1: It's given me that good fantasy vibe, which is hard to get going in my blood.

634
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:56,824
Speaker 0: So anyway, and then the final meta we have an IRC channel.

00:39:37,718 --> 00:39:39,165
Speaker 0: you're not allowed to upload videos of it.

649

00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:44,124
Speaker 1: No, I looked into that.

652
00:39:44,425 --> 00:39:45,610
Speaker 1: most likely I'd get a strike.

653
00:39:47,333 --> 00:39:52,184
Speaker 0: Anyway You're better off just posting a photo of your junk to Imgur.

654
00:39:52,224 --> 00:39:52,848
Speaker 0: that'll stay there.

655
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:55,643
Speaker 1: now I'll upload a YouTube video that has a still of it in the middle.

656
00:39:55,744 --> 00:39:56,750
Speaker 1: take a while for people to notice.

657
00:39:57,251 --> 00:39:58,395
Speaker 0: Mmm, someone might report it.

658
00:39:58,737 --> 00:39:59,118
Speaker 1: Yeah, they.

659
00:39:59,138 --> 00:40:02,650
Speaker 0: probably there's also people who review every YouTube almost every YouTube video that goes up.

660
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:08,690
Speaker 1: Anyway, anyway anyway, so traders of Genoa is a game that we played.

661
00:40:09,071 --> 00:40:10,256
Speaker 0: But did we do things of the day?

662
00:40:10,316 --> 00:40:10,617
Speaker 0: We did.

663
00:40:10,638 --> 00:40:11,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, we did.

664
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:12,103
Speaker 1: Okay with you.

665
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:12,786
Speaker 0: I'm forgetting.

666
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:15,514
Speaker 1: All right captain All right, then lead us off.

667
00:40:16,015 --> 00:40:20,770
Speaker 0: Okay, so there's a game called traders of Genoa, but now is just called Genoa, right?

668
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:21,292
Speaker 0: I played.

669
00:40:21,312 --> 00:40:23,243
Speaker 0: there's a. it was an original printing in the u.s.

670
00:40:23,303 --> 00:40:24,430
Speaker 0: Is it traders general on it?

671
00:40:24,751 --> 00:40:31,710
Speaker 0: I played that a long time ago back in Beacon Poughkeepsie actually at Maas and then some reason I didn't go to that Maas meeting.

672
00:40:31,891 --> 00:40:34,707
Speaker 0: Yeah, that guy remember he went to his apartment.

673
00:40:34,727 --> 00:40:35,230
Speaker 0: He was there.

674
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:39,847
Speaker 0: He played it with us, but it was brought by this red-haired guy with the apartment with the bird.

675
00:40:39,867 --> 00:40:44,850
Speaker 1: Yes Okay, I played shadows over Camelot and then there were like the two cool people in town.

676
00:40:44,870 --> 00:40:47,924
Speaker 0: But there was that there was another cool person who you did not see.

677
00:40:47,944 --> 00:40:49,230
Speaker 0: that was there the red-haired guy.

678
00:40:49,451 --> 00:40:51,200
Speaker 1: Yeah, I never played a game with him.

679
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,090
Speaker 0: He owned traders in Genoa and he played at that time.

680
00:40:53,170 --> 00:40:56,703
Speaker 1: How come the three cool people literally disappeared and we had no context?

681
00:40:56,924 --> 00:40:58,469
Speaker 0: Oh, that's he get for not going every time.

682
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:02,164
Speaker 1: No, but we they disappeared and somehow we had no way to think.

683
00:41:02,264 --> 00:41:03,770
Speaker 0: I have a business card from one of the guys.

684
00:41:03,890 --> 00:41:04,535
Speaker 1: You should email them.

685
00:41:04,555 --> 00:41:08,009
Speaker 1: be like, hey, you're still in Poughkeepsie anyway.

686
00:41:09,151 --> 00:41:16,330
Speaker 0: So I played the game then and the whole gist of the game Is that it's a game where all the bits in the game are tradable, right?

687
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:22,689
Speaker 0: So it's like, you know, you play Monopoly and it's like you're not really allowed to just trade money with people, right?

688
00:41:23,052 --> 00:41:23,760
Speaker 0: It's like you can.

689
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:24,710
Speaker 0: I guess it's in the rules.

690
00:41:24,771 --> 00:41:25,961
Speaker 0: You can trade properties.

691
00:41:26,142 --> 00:41:36,288
Speaker 0: and it's like, you know A lot of games that have trading a really respect even have trading at all have like credibly you can trade Resources for resources in a very constrained.

692
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:43,290
Speaker 0: Yeah There are very few games that have ultra freeform trading and traders in Genoa also does not have completely freeform trading.

693
00:41:43,633 --> 00:41:49,230
Speaker 0: You can only trade with the person whose turn it is Right and you can only make trades that are binding and immediate.

694
00:41:49,311 --> 00:41:56,752
Speaker 0: The only other kind of trade you can make that's binding is If somebody is going to go into a workshop and this will make no sense If you've never played it.

695
00:41:57,094 --> 00:41:59,120
Speaker 0: you can trade with them for the goods.

696
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:01,648
Speaker 0: The workshop would produce when they go into it, right?

697
00:42:02,009 --> 00:42:05,699
Speaker 0: So Other than that, you can't really do anything.

698
00:42:05,779 --> 00:42:08,910
Speaker 0: But the interesting thing is all the different pieces in the game.

699
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:17,790
Speaker 0: You know the cardboard pieces cards tokens money Recent goods, you know all the different kinds of bits and there's a bunch of them.

700
00:42:17,810 --> 00:42:21,684
Speaker 0: There's like four or five six different kinds of bits can all be traded.

701
00:42:21,704 --> 00:42:32,130
Speaker 0: so you can be like I'll give you $3 and a tree for your Contract and a beer, you know you can really go crazy with that.

702
00:42:32,190 --> 00:42:35,570
Speaker 0: And that is the core of the fun and awesomeness of this game.

703
00:42:36,393 --> 00:42:41,450
Speaker 0: So it's had a recent reprinting in the United States and where it's just called Genoa instead of traders in Genoa.

704
00:42:41,771 --> 00:42:48,099
Speaker 0: But it is the exact same goddamn game as far as I can tell only newly printed with new art that kind of thing Going on bigger.

705
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:54,302
Speaker 0: I think it's like larger In its construction, you know, I have no way to tell bigger board bigger pieces.

706
00:42:54,383 --> 00:42:58,858
Speaker 0: I think I'm not a hundred percent sure But it's the same game and it's just as fun.

707
00:42:58,898 --> 00:43:01,910
Speaker 0: and we own it and we've now both played it many more times.

708
00:43:02,271 --> 00:43:08,490
Speaker 1: Now the the gist of it's pretty simple you basically it's hard to really explain a lot of the bits without looking at a board.

709
00:43:08,691 --> 00:43:11,822
Speaker 1: Basically you move around this board like you have a trail.

710
00:43:11,862 --> 00:43:17,722
Speaker 1: you leave like a slime trail of traders and Every turn you're like trade der not trade toe.

711
00:43:17,782 --> 00:43:19,490
Speaker 1: I could move it here or move it there.

712
00:43:20,054 --> 00:43:21,910
Speaker 1: What do you guys want me to do and Scott will be like?

713
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,505
Speaker 1: I'll give you a beer and five bucks if you move it there.

714
00:43:25,545 --> 00:43:31,530
Speaker 0: and let me do the thing Right, because basically you move this train of discs around the board and they all have to be in a line.

715
00:43:31,610 --> 00:43:33,621
Speaker 0: But you could sort of you know, you follow a path.

716
00:43:33,962 --> 00:43:38,499
Speaker 0: think of it as there is a guy He's walking around town doing errands in one day.

717
00:43:38,559 --> 00:43:53,470
Speaker 0: He can walk five squares, right and in those five squares He's gonna go into certain buildings and do errands in each of those buildings that he walks into Alright one person on is controlling the guy who walks around town and he moves all five spaces.

718
00:43:54,353 --> 00:44:00,814
Speaker 0: Every time he goes into a building one of the players at the table gets to do the errand in that building But only once.

719
00:44:00,854 --> 00:44:05,430
Speaker 0: so you can't normally do two different buildings in the same turn.

720
00:44:05,570 --> 00:44:08,841
Speaker 0: If I do the brewery, that's it for me this turn.

721
00:44:08,881 --> 00:44:11,530
Speaker 0: I can't also do the City Hall in the same turn, right?

722
00:44:11,851 --> 00:44:19,967
Speaker 0: So even though I'm controlling the guy walking around the town Only one of the buildings that I walk into I can keep I can do myself.

723
00:44:20,027 --> 00:44:21,574
Speaker 0: the other buildings I walk into.

724
00:44:21,594 --> 00:44:30,430
Speaker 0: other people at the table are gonna do those buildings Which means I need to get them to pay me to let them do those buildings or I can just end my turn immediately.

725
00:44:30,914 --> 00:44:40,350
Speaker 1: Now if I haven't taken my action yet Like I'm the traitor or doing the thing if I haven't taken my action yet I could always be like, well, I'm gonna use it myself unless someone else gives me another bid.

726
00:44:40,791 --> 00:44:52,818
Speaker 1: But if I come back if I'm gonna go into a place and someone actually does offer me like offers me something I have to take it or in my turn right like if no one at the table wants anything that's adjacent to rim Right and I say rim.

727
00:44:52,838 --> 00:44:55,109
Speaker 0: I'll give you $1 for the thing next to you.

728
00:44:55,591 --> 00:45:01,090
Speaker 0: He either has to say yes and let me have it or do it himself or end his turn.

729
00:45:01,191 --> 00:45:03,089
Speaker 0: Those are the only three options available to him.

730
00:45:03,752 --> 00:45:16,467
Speaker 1: now the other cool thing about this game is like Scott said you can trade anything for anything and there's a spatial clue like component of what's close to what and moving around and then there's all these different bits like you can get a contract

731
00:45:16,627 --> 00:45:16,848
Speaker 0: yep,

732
00:45:17,269 --> 00:45:19,155
Speaker 1: which you which has like.

733
00:45:19,235 --> 00:45:33,130
Speaker 1: there's things that have to do with having like a number of contracts adjacent to each other or like deals were like get these particular combinations of goods and then cash them in at this place or Have the trader go between this place and this place in one turn.

734
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:35,637
Speaker 1: So you have hidden information of.

735
00:45:36,018 --> 00:45:37,162
Speaker 1: here are my goals.

736
00:45:37,182 --> 00:45:46,550
Speaker 1: that will get me a bunch of money and everyone else has their own hidden Goals and you're all trying to negotiate to maximize your own goals and minimize the goals of others.

737
00:45:48,154 --> 00:45:49,890
Speaker 0: But did I mention that the way to win this game?

738
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:51,960
Speaker 0: The only thing that matters is at the very end.

739
00:45:51,980 --> 00:45:53,990
Speaker 0: How much money do you have, right?

740
00:45:54,030 --> 00:45:55,249
Speaker 0: That's all that matters at the end.

741
00:45:55,310 --> 00:46:02,330
Speaker 0: And of course at the end of the game a lot of some of the things you have like contracts can be converted into Money straight up depending on you know what you have.

742
00:46:02,692 --> 00:46:05,130
Speaker 0: But a lot of the things are worth no money at the end of the game.

743
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:07,790
Speaker 0: Like if you just have a beer sitting there at the end of the game, it's worth nothing.

744
00:46:08,192 --> 00:46:11,630
Speaker 0: There might be some tiebreakers involving things like that, but I'm not sure what they are.

745
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:12,788
Speaker 0: I don't have the rules in front of me.

746
00:46:13,331 --> 00:46:20,430
Speaker 0: So really it's all about just getting as much money as possible and all these other bits are just means of getting money.

747
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:26,150
Speaker 0: Now a lot of them if you get them in the right combinations in time could be worth like a hundred bucks.

748
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:29,603
Speaker 0: So like if you're get some rim is like he really wants a beer.

749
00:46:29,784 --> 00:46:31,390
Speaker 0: I see as a large contract.

750
00:46:32,054 --> 00:46:34,910
Speaker 0: I know that with that beer he could potentially get a hundred bucks.

751
00:46:35,351 --> 00:46:36,255
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna be like rim.

752
00:46:36,556 --> 00:46:40,128
Speaker 0: this beer is basically, you know, it's what's it actually worth in the game.

753
00:46:40,209 --> 00:46:46,350
Speaker 0: overall It may be ten, you know, who knows what but to you at this moment in time it is worth a hundred dollars.

754
00:46:47,053 --> 00:46:51,432
Speaker 0: So if you want it, you're going to have to pay out the nose Right.

755
00:46:51,793 --> 00:46:54,885
Speaker 0: It's like it's worth, you know, at least fifty right?

756
00:46:54,925 --> 00:47:02,170
Speaker 0: Cuz that'll be sort of fair But I want to win so I'll give you give me sixty four Right, and that's the kind of shit that goes on in this game.

757
00:47:02,290 --> 00:47:11,630
Speaker 0: It's like oh if someone else wanted the beer I'd be like oh ten bucks cuz I know that you only have a small Contract which means the most you could get from this beer would be thirty, you know.

758
00:47:11,751 --> 00:47:22,270
Speaker 0: So that all that kind of stuff comes into play where you're looking at what the other guy has To figure out how much the thing is worth to them now as opposed to how much something is worth on a global market.

759
00:47:22,451 --> 00:47:24,850
Speaker 1: Now what's interesting is that this game shares?

760
00:47:25,390 --> 00:47:29,849
Speaker 1: Two very important aspects with another game that we play a lot and I think we've talked about on the show modern art.

761
00:47:30,591 --> 00:47:37,088
Speaker 1: One the one of the mediums you use for bidding and trading is also victory points in both games.

762
00:47:37,549 --> 00:47:40,240
Speaker 1: and two Both games get around.

763
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:52,163
Speaker 1: the settlers problem of it's not act Like no one actually wants to trade or do business because in both this game and modern art The mechanics basically force you to trade new business.

764
00:47:52,183 --> 00:48:01,609
Speaker 0: I think the other game that does that of course is bizarre Bonanza - right it's people if you're playing out trading right points, right?

765
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:05,283
Speaker 0: No, that's It forced you to trade right does is that you?

766
00:48:05,363 --> 00:48:08,053
Speaker 0: if you have a game where there is trading People?

767
00:48:08,073 --> 00:48:14,170
Speaker 0: if it's if it's just freeform trading there is no reason to trade with anyone unless you're ripping them off.

768
00:48:14,810 --> 00:48:24,699
Speaker 0: Therefore right if all players playing are smart and it is not possible to rip anyone off because anyone will reject a ripoff trade No one will trade.

769
00:48:24,981 --> 00:48:27,318
Speaker 0: but trading is fun And you that's part of the.

770
00:48:27,419 --> 00:48:46,327
Speaker 0: that's why settlers isn't fun Or very fun when you have good players because no one trades and the whole fun of the game is like brick for wood All right, so in order to have a fun game for smart people with trading that is fun You need something to force people to make it a good idea to trade even if you're not getting ripped off.

771
00:48:46,729 --> 00:48:47,030
Speaker 0: and what?

772
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:53,104
Speaker 0: Genoa does to make that happen is they give you multiple opportunities when it's your turn to where?

773
00:48:53,566 --> 00:48:55,290
Speaker 0: sure your turn could end right here.

774
00:48:55,410 --> 00:49:03,979
Speaker 0: But if you go and you walk your little guy and you move the tower into other buildings Allowing other people to run errands in those buildings.

775
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:09,818
Speaker 0: they will pay you and you will get resources this turn You know right now that you could use.

776
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:13,350
Speaker 0: if you end the turn you're not getting anything for the rest of this turn.

777
00:49:13,390 --> 00:49:18,550
Speaker 0: So even though you're helping other people you will also be helping yourself in this turn versus ending it right now.

778
00:49:18,570 --> 00:49:27,930
Speaker 0: and if everyone just went to one building and ended their turn on every single action if One person didn't do that that person be pretty much guaranteed to win because all the extra stuff they be getting.

779
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:32,081
Speaker 0: So it's a good idea to let people pay you to do things.

780
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:41,818
Speaker 1: games like this really put into stark contrast games that involve trading but don't either don't facilitate people actually trading or the trading like the other way around.

781
00:49:41,838 --> 00:49:43,143
Speaker 1: the no one trades and settlers.

782
00:49:43,223 --> 00:49:44,609
Speaker 1: if it turns into the vote who wins game?

783
00:49:44,669 --> 00:49:52,010
Speaker 1: where You know you people trade or don't trade based on who they like or they're the politicals or the heuristics.

784
00:49:52,131 --> 00:49:56,990
Speaker 1: Right you're reading the Richard Garfield book yet Can I start using the terminology from it instead of our own time?

785
00:49:57,050 --> 00:50:00,870
Speaker 0: I'm gonna start reading it soon cuz I just finished the book because what we call vote who wins games?

786
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,416
Speaker 1: He calls the chip taking game.

787
00:50:02,476 --> 00:50:04,043
Speaker 0: I won't describe the chip taking game.

788
00:50:04,083 --> 00:50:04,545
Speaker 0: Is it a sim?

789
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,870
Speaker 0: is one of the simple example game.

790
00:50:05,910 --> 00:50:11,761
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the chip taking game shows how some games Because of the mechanics the.

791
00:50:11,781 --> 00:50:13,129
Speaker 1: now here's another thing.

792
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:17,862
Speaker 1: Particularly, this is a flaw in games that involve direct fucking.

793
00:50:18,263 --> 00:50:20,690
Speaker 1: Yep, which is what we call he calls it something else.

794
00:50:21,192 --> 00:50:26,610
Speaker 1: But direct fucking is a game like Vinci where I can attack Scott the player directly in the game.

795
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:28,477
Speaker 0: that is true that is that has a lot of vote.

796
00:50:28,497 --> 00:50:29,501
Speaker 0: who wins aspects?

797
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:32,251
Speaker 1: so games that have direct fucking tend to have vote.

798
00:50:32,532 --> 00:50:33,635
Speaker 1: who wins ideas?

799
00:50:33,835 --> 00:50:35,420
Speaker 0: right because if you just you can choose.

800
00:50:35,921 --> 00:50:41,457
Speaker 0: if you're playing say three four players you choose who you attack and Whoever you attack your vote.

801
00:50:41,478 --> 00:50:43,226
Speaker 0: You're basically voting for them to lose now.

802
00:50:43,246 --> 00:50:44,150
Speaker 0: They're falling behind.

803
00:50:44,230 --> 00:50:45,275
Speaker 1: So here's the chip taking game.

804
00:50:45,355 --> 00:50:47,504
Speaker 1: every round everyone has an action.

805
00:50:47,625 --> 00:50:47,906
Speaker 1: Well.

806
00:50:47,926 --> 00:50:48,830
Speaker 0: What do you have at the beginning?

807
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:54,207
Speaker 1: Yeah, so everyone starts with ten chips and on your round you choose one person take a chip away from them and throw it in the garbage.

808
00:50:54,931 --> 00:50:59,910
Speaker 1: Whoever is the last man standing with any chips wins the game, so wouldn't you just always so round one?

809
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:00,754
Speaker 0: How many people are playing?

810
00:51:00,774 --> 00:51:04,050
Speaker 1: let's say you me and Scott Johnson three, okay?

811
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,795
Speaker 0: So round one I take from Scott Johnson.

812
00:51:05,875 --> 00:51:10,590
Speaker 0: round two you're not gonna take from you know Scott Johnson cuz you already down one.

813
00:51:10,790 --> 00:51:11,894
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna take from yourselves.

814
00:51:11,914 --> 00:51:15,745
Speaker 0: you take from me, and then Scott Johnson takes from you.

815
00:51:15,765 --> 00:51:21,421
Speaker 0: so basically whoever Went It depend you know depending on the turn order.

816
00:51:21,762 --> 00:51:25,439
Speaker 0: right we're basically so we're all down to one And then it's someone's turn.

817
00:51:25,459 --> 00:51:26,806
Speaker 0: I guess I went first right.

818
00:51:27,288 --> 00:51:32,643
Speaker 0: so now I'm voting either rim or Scott Johnson will be eliminated and then so I eliminate.

819
00:51:32,763 --> 00:51:34,127
Speaker 0: say Scott Johnson.

820
00:51:34,147 --> 00:51:37,739
Speaker 0: then on your turn you eliminate me Or I eliminate you and then Scott Johnson eliminates me.

821
00:51:37,759 --> 00:51:38,322
Speaker 0: now look you can.

822
00:51:38,342 --> 00:51:39,145
Speaker 1: now here's the problem.

823
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:43,192
Speaker 1: you iterate through that the game is either set or Who?

824
00:51:43,413 --> 00:51:48,548
Speaker 0: if it's arbitrary what if it's simultaneous voting to which chip to remove?

825
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:56,121
Speaker 0: yeah But even then right cuz then at round one we both we all reveal our votes And we mean you both mean you both vote Scott Johnson now.

826
00:51:56,141 --> 00:52:01,435
Speaker 0: He's down, too, so then in the second round well You're not gonna vote Scott Johnson again You're gonna vote me and I'm gonna vote you.

827
00:52:01,877 --> 00:52:03,502
Speaker 0: cuz we just both voted Scott John.

828
00:52:03,542 --> 00:52:10,786
Speaker 0: so think about Johnson's gonna pick one of us Again, so think about this one of the game like this now other one of us in a game like this.

829
00:52:10,846 --> 00:52:17,429
Speaker 1: now the person Who's ahead isn't necessarily the person with the most chips cuz that's the person who's going to be fucked the most right.

830
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:21,123
Speaker 0: you would be Thinking at least one or two rounds ahead of who's someone gonna vote for right?

831
00:52:21,143 --> 00:52:24,583
Speaker 0: cuz you know in round one We both voted for Scott Johnson.

832
00:52:24,623 --> 00:52:25,369
Speaker 0: He's down to eight.

833
00:52:26,034 --> 00:52:27,845
Speaker 0: He voted for me, so I'm down to nine.

834
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:28,589
Speaker 0: you're still at ten.

835
00:52:28,991 --> 00:52:34,229
Speaker 0: So I'm gonna vote for you, and he's probably also gonna vote for you, and then you're gonna vote for me.

836
00:52:34,812 --> 00:52:35,818
Speaker 0: Right so then we're all dead.

837
00:52:36,341 --> 00:52:38,010
Speaker 0: so, but then I know that you were doing.

838
00:52:38,512 --> 00:52:43,230
Speaker 1: The determining factor of the game is either arbitrary political bullshit or attack rim.

839
00:52:43,310 --> 00:52:49,850
Speaker 0: He's gonna win right, but it also you get a little bit especially when the chips are getting low like when someone has two chips.

840
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:57,030
Speaker 0: Suddenly it becomes the stick game of unstable state because if you only have two chips you could theoretically be eliminated that immediately.

841
00:52:57,030 --> 00:52:58,556
Speaker 1: Well, no, then it doesn't become the stick game.

842
00:52:58,597 --> 00:53:05,883
Speaker 1: It becomes the game is already over game Or it becomes the brinksmanship game of Scott.

843
00:53:05,903 --> 00:53:06,726
Speaker 1: if you don't attack him.

844
00:53:06,786 --> 00:53:07,469
Speaker 1: He's gonna win.

845
00:53:07,529 --> 00:53:10,190
Speaker 1: so Which is a problem in many games basically?

846
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:15,288
Speaker 0: I'm in two and you're both at one the only chance you guys has of winning is if you both vote for me.

847
00:53:15,308 --> 00:53:22,816
Speaker 1: anyway the Terminology that Garfield uses one of you will die because I'm attacking only one is that these Many games just boil down to the like.

848
00:53:22,836 --> 00:53:24,179
Speaker 1: the mechanics don't matter.

849
00:53:24,199 --> 00:53:28,490
Speaker 1: the actual decisions that matter are just which player do I attack?

850
00:53:29,230 --> 00:53:30,153
Speaker 1: Who do I fuck?

851
00:53:30,454 --> 00:53:35,750
Speaker 0: and that's basically deciding which of the other players will lose and your own fate is out of your hands unless?

852
00:53:35,911 --> 00:53:39,849
Speaker 0: You know you would obviously pick the person most likely to vote for you, but that's really all there is to it.

853
00:53:40,171 --> 00:53:45,965
Speaker 1: So once again that you know just to kind of show how cool This book is just because it gives us terminology for all this stuff.

854
00:53:46,207 --> 00:53:46,750
Speaker 1: look at settlers.

855
00:53:47,012 --> 00:53:49,710
Speaker 1: I used to win settlers a lot in our crew before.

856
00:53:50,011 --> 00:53:55,690
Speaker 1: Everyone got really good at settlers and the reason I was able to do it is that the settlers breaks down in that whoever's the?

857
00:53:56,030 --> 00:53:56,111
Speaker 1: Head.

858
00:53:56,633 --> 00:54:02,245
Speaker 1: whenever the seven comes up everyone tries to gangbang on the person who's winning so they don't win to give everyone else a chance to catch up.

859
00:54:03,152 --> 00:54:16,090
Speaker 1: So the key to the game was to lay low and be in second place with a non obvious way To jump ahead of the last second wimpy cards or longest road out of nowhere being close to having longest road and largest army.

860
00:54:16,150 --> 00:54:21,230
Speaker 1: But somehow other people don't notice because and here's the way you don't actually have them in front of you the game has.

861
00:54:21,991 --> 00:54:26,947
Speaker 1: Other players have a poor model in their head of who's actually winning and that is the key.

862
00:54:26,987 --> 00:54:27,890
Speaker 0: and traders of Genoa.

863
00:54:28,191 --> 00:54:38,150
Speaker 0: It is really fucking hard to tell who is actually winning because somebody might be like hundreds of dollars behind you But they might be having a fistful of completed large contracts.

864
00:54:38,190 --> 00:54:48,296
Speaker 0: They just haven't cashed in yet and as soon as you get near via Paletti boom They just lay it out boom boom and they're just you know Cashing them in big time right at the end of the game now And there's nothing you can do about it.

865
00:54:48,316 --> 00:54:50,690
Speaker 1: Here's where the game breaks down and that it's a little not fun.

866
00:54:51,211 --> 00:54:55,825
Speaker 1: The big contracts are worth a hundred dinars ducats whatever the money is.

867
00:54:55,885 --> 00:54:59,318
Speaker 1: yeah now the trouble with that Is that the you know these big contracts?

868
00:54:59,559 --> 00:55:03,342
Speaker 1: There's four places where you can cash them in any time.

869
00:55:03,845 --> 00:55:08,924
Speaker 1: a player Wants to go there and has at least three goods.

870
00:55:09,386 --> 00:55:17,590
Speaker 1: everyone assumes Pretty much correctly that they have a big contract and demands a large portion of the profits.

871
00:55:18,072 --> 00:55:21,690
Speaker 1: So it's a very predictable and unfun element of the game.

872
00:55:21,771 --> 00:55:23,650
Speaker 1: There's no way to really bluff that well.

873
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:31,850
Speaker 0: But the point is is that that person already paid out a whole bunch Along the way to even get those goods unless they were really lucky and the contract itself.

874
00:55:32,292 --> 00:55:34,845
Speaker 0: So it's like then to pay out a huge portion of the profits.

875
00:55:34,885 --> 00:55:39,422
Speaker 0: on the final end It's like on the large contract how much do you actually make?

876
00:55:39,843 --> 00:55:40,786
Speaker 0: so you know.

877
00:55:40,947 --> 00:55:41,990
Speaker 0: if you have to you know?

878
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:44,562
Speaker 1: But I'm saying it the more you're going for.

879
00:55:44,622 --> 00:55:46,050
Speaker 1: cashing it in is not fun.

880
00:55:46,872 --> 00:55:51,014
Speaker 0: That's true among smart, and you don't even get a contract What's it called.

881
00:55:51,677 --> 00:56:01,770
Speaker 1: so the only reason people go after those Or the only way people go after them is going after the things that let you teleport somewhere automatically.

882
00:56:02,252 --> 00:56:07,112
Speaker 1: But then people realize that the game determinator Determiner.

883
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:09,297
Speaker 1: so people now treat that the same way.

884
00:56:09,338 --> 00:56:19,923
Speaker 1: they treat the corners and you can see how the game that the negotiations around that especially among Smart but not necessarily well versed in the game players.

885
00:56:20,385 --> 00:56:21,610
Speaker 1: It's just not super fun.

886
00:56:22,071 --> 00:56:25,384
Speaker 1: It's super fun among really apt players who are also smart.

887
00:56:25,725 --> 00:56:35,270
Speaker 1: It's not fun among Inexperienced players who are smart, but it is fun again If there's a new inexperienced and on the smart players, and you're taking advantage of the nubs exactly.

888
00:56:36,451 --> 00:56:40,110
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean, it's like you know, but that gets into the the classic example.

889
00:56:40,150 --> 00:56:43,695
Speaker 0: And then there's the whole thing where like they'll be enough doing something dumb And they'll be helping out.

890
00:56:43,735 --> 00:56:47,110
Speaker 0: say rim and I'll try to educate the nub and say look you're about to give rim all this.

891
00:56:47,231 --> 00:56:48,480
Speaker 1: Whatever guys advise it.

892
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:49,749
Speaker 0: What's going on you want to do?

893
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:52,179
Speaker 1: He's lying and trying to win advice.

894
00:56:52,340 --> 00:56:54,790
Speaker 0: rim is the person who lies and Scott never lies.

895
00:56:54,971 --> 00:57:02,407
Speaker 1: And you know what the result of that is someone other than me and Scott wins the game like that Possibly, but then I win because that's because you didn't listen to me.

896
00:57:02,427 --> 00:57:14,709
Speaker 0: Yeah If I tell you that the move rims about to make is gonna earn him that much money and that you should ask him for Four victory points and Scott has a fistful of beer and whatever and that's how these games.

897
00:57:14,729 --> 00:57:15,637
Speaker 0: yeah It's only beer.

898
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,673
Speaker 0: you can't do anything with just beer You know what?

899
00:57:17,733 --> 00:57:24,508
Speaker 1: if you're a German style euro board gamer type and you like these kinds of games Jenna was on the you might as well own it list.

900
00:57:24,589 --> 00:57:37,522
Speaker 0: yeah I mean the fact that you can trade anything for anything You know makes this game a whole lot of fun for the vast majority of people who like to play strategic games You know and it can only really be unfun for you.

901
00:57:37,743 --> 00:57:49,409
Speaker 0: if a you don't like trading at all be your it's basically everyone at the table is me and rim me and rim or And you do all play like assholes and everyone knows everything.

902
00:57:49,449 --> 00:57:50,573
Speaker 0: now It's actively.

903
00:57:50,613 --> 00:57:58,160
Speaker 1: despite looking like what I see you none of you are smart enough to actually understand the game looks Complex like and Decker if you just look at it.

904
00:57:58,321 --> 00:57:58,441
Speaker 0: No.

905
00:57:58,502 --> 00:57:58,723
Speaker 0: It's.

906
00:57:58,783 --> 00:58:00,530
Speaker 0: it's one of those deceptively simple game.

907
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:05,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you if you have someone else teach you the rules the game is rid dick.

908
00:58:05,588 --> 00:58:06,250
Speaker 1: simple to learn.

909
00:58:06,270 --> 00:58:06,912
Speaker 0: I hate all these.

910
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:07,434
Speaker 0: that's one.

911
00:58:07,494 --> 00:58:12,129
Speaker 1: now the game sucks to learn if nobody at the table already knows how to play.

912
00:58:12,269 --> 00:58:17,141
Speaker 0: one thing I really hate about a lot of games lately I've noticed is like you know a gregola or this.

913
00:58:17,422 --> 00:58:20,313
Speaker 1: or if someone teaches you how to play It's a unit.

914
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:20,855
Speaker 0: it's great.

915
00:58:20,935 --> 00:58:24,166
Speaker 0: even if someone teaches you it's like they teach you so many things.

916
00:58:24,307 --> 00:58:25,673
Speaker 0: you can't leave anything out Right.

917
00:58:26,016 --> 00:58:46,884
Speaker 0: so they teach you all these rules And it takes a long time no matter how even if you're super fast learners And they go over all these different bits and cards and all these things and then when you actually play It's like oh, this is really actually fast and simple and most of those rules I had to learn don't come into play very often and When they do I sort of know them now, and it makes sense.

918
00:58:47,125 --> 00:58:48,290
Speaker 0: and this game is way.

919
00:58:48,611 --> 00:58:52,065
Speaker 0: You know it's interesting, but explaining the rules was not easy at all.

920
00:58:52,266 --> 00:59:00,486
Speaker 1: one of the examples Carfield's bug that it I never thought of because like hard to teach easy to play because I don't like.

921
00:59:01,028 --> 00:59:05,250
Speaker 1: I used to play games Like cribbage bridge and whatever and I really don't like games like that anymore.

922
00:59:06,012 --> 00:59:15,596
Speaker 1: I like hearts inexplicably, and I enjoy Euchre, but I only enjoy Euchre if I cheat at it, but anyway, so the the idea of The people who's

923
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:19,113
Speaker 0: every show about board games actually going to be a review of the stupid book now Until

924
00:59:19,173 --> 00:59:22,129
Speaker 1: you read it and I can just start using the terminology from the book.

925
00:59:22,732 --> 00:59:26,290
Speaker 1: Granted I like our term direct fucking more than his terms.

926
00:59:26,391 --> 00:59:27,529
Speaker 1: I think I'm gonna keep using that one.

927
00:59:28,432 --> 00:59:45,879
Speaker 1: But so if you want people who teach that game who understand that game will usually also teach bidding systems in bridge which are the Systems of bidding to indicate to the other player whether or not you have a good hand and what they should do and all that Bullshit, which is crucial to playing

928
00:59:45,939 --> 00:59:47,062
Speaker 0: bridge without cheating.

929
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:57,065
Speaker 1: Yeah, but at the same time Really Really confuses new players and really obfuscates what the core mechanics of bridge are.

930
00:59:57,586 --> 00:59:58,850
Speaker 0: and really don't you know?

931
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:07,122
Speaker 0: I don't even really know the full rules of bridge but like the the scant details I do know they make it seem like wow, that's fucking stupid.

932
01:00:07,182 --> 01:00:07,362
Speaker 0: right.

933
01:00:07,422 --> 01:00:08,084
Speaker 0: what it's like?

934
01:00:08,105 --> 01:00:11,749
Speaker 0: if there's a special signaling system We're like you can't communicate but you can bid.

935
01:00:12,192 --> 01:00:18,724
Speaker 0: So if I bid 10 and that's a signal to my partner to do a certain thing now Don't the other players know what that signal is too?

936
01:00:18,765 --> 01:00:19,630
Speaker 0: because it's a well-known?

937
01:00:19,791 --> 01:00:20,896
Speaker 1: Yes, so then the game.

938
01:00:20,916 --> 01:00:22,042
Speaker 1: so then it's Street Fighter.

939
01:00:22,062 --> 01:00:32,483
Speaker 1: you have this high-level game of Using increasingly complex bidding systems or using a bidding system to bluff So the other team but then wouldn't my partner know?

940
01:00:32,603 --> 01:00:40,623
Speaker 0: not and if I'm trying to bluff and you know You're not allowed to communicate so I try to fool the other players that are on the other team But I end up fooling my own partner and we fuck ourselves.

941
01:00:40,643 --> 01:00:41,809
Speaker 1: You got to trust the other player.

942
01:00:42,111 --> 01:00:45,950
Speaker 1: We mean trust that they understand the bidding systems enough.

943
01:00:46,871 --> 01:00:48,238
Speaker 0: It's it's it's you know, it's like.

944
01:00:48,318 --> 01:00:50,550
Speaker 0: I think it's just nonsense to me.

945
01:00:50,690 --> 01:00:55,050
Speaker 1: I'll be honest games like bridge are taking a deck of cards and doing too much with it.

946
01:00:56,034 --> 01:00:56,899
Speaker 0: I get that I haven't.

947
01:00:56,939 --> 01:01:01,950
Speaker 0: I don't know the rules of bridge and I know a lot I used to play is a lot of advanced bridge out there.

948
01:01:02,211 --> 01:01:09,752
Speaker 0: I heard sort of water is but I just don't know enough about it to really make a you know an informed Judgment.

949
01:01:09,972 --> 01:01:11,838
Speaker 1: I just I don't enjoy games like that anymore.

950
01:01:11,858 --> 01:01:14,285
Speaker 1: I don't enjoy trick-taking games with bidding systems.

951
01:01:14,305 --> 01:01:18,621
Speaker 1: I Like hearts - yeah, but hearts is also.

952
01:01:18,902 --> 01:01:20,790
Speaker 1: we get to be ever done a show on hearts.

953
01:01:20,971 --> 01:01:21,975
Speaker 0: We do a whole show at.

954
01:01:22,155 --> 01:01:23,942
Speaker 1: I could do a whole fucking show on hearts.

955
01:01:23,962 --> 01:01:24,806
Speaker 1: You shut your mouth.

956
01:01:24,846 --> 01:01:33,583
Speaker 1: Microsoft hearts front row crew calm archive Hearts Hearts.

957
01:01:35,192 --> 01:01:40,471
Speaker 1: So we did a special on it on September 11 2007. there you go Huh?

958
01:01:40,933 --> 01:01:42,659
Speaker 0: He knows he's already like two years old.

959
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:44,846
Speaker 1: I know hearts is a good game now.

960
01:01:44,947 --> 01:01:47,193
Speaker 0: It's Seven years old.

961
01:01:47,374 --> 01:01:48,176
Speaker 1: Anyway, I think we're done.

962
01:01:48,196 --> 01:01:49,720
Speaker 1: You know what Genoa it's.

963
01:01:50,001 --> 01:01:50,141
Speaker 1: it's.

964
01:01:50,382 --> 01:01:54,857
Speaker 1: if you care about German style of art games You should own Genoa.

965
01:01:54,897 --> 01:01:57,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're the entry shelf, this is like there with Puerto Rico.

966
01:01:58,273 --> 01:02:00,530
Speaker 0: This is like the second is the second tier right?

967
01:02:00,570 --> 01:02:05,950
Speaker 0: Like if you are already, you know, if you're hardcore in the European board games, this is the second tier game.

968
01:02:06,010 --> 01:02:06,572
Speaker 0: You got to get it.

969
01:02:06,813 --> 01:02:10,990
Speaker 0: But if you're a dabbler or a newbie or whatever, this is not the first tier.

970
01:02:11,131 --> 01:02:12,899
Speaker 0: So it should not be one of the first games you buy.

971
01:02:12,919 --> 01:02:21,170
Speaker 0: you should but like once you've already covered Like the a-plus games and you're looking for more then Jenna was one of the first games you should go start to look at.

972
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:24,835
Speaker 0: I mean, it's board game geek rank 172 out of many thousands.

973
01:02:25,256 --> 01:02:26,219
Speaker 0: It's not bad.

974
01:02:26,239 --> 01:02:31,989
Speaker 0: I actually really kind of want to play end decker again now With the huts, the huts are the only good part.

975
01:02:32,291 --> 01:02:35,608
Speaker 1: No, fuck the huts you think is you say the huts is the good part.

976
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:36,572
Speaker 1: one They're not.

977
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:39,083
Speaker 1: and two, how come you always fuck up the huts?

978
01:02:39,385 --> 01:02:40,550
Speaker 0: I'm not gonna say I'm good at the huts.

979
01:02:40,630 --> 01:02:41,575
Speaker 0: I just really like that.

980
01:02:41,595 --> 01:02:44,790
Speaker 0: there's little huts and they're hidden and you sort of walk these dudes over to go investigate.

981
01:02:44,810 --> 01:02:46,663
Speaker 1: It's all the games all of our risk management.

982
01:02:46,683 --> 01:02:47,448
Speaker 0: It's physically fun.

983
01:02:47,488 --> 01:02:48,148
Speaker 0: the huts And you know what?

984
01:02:48,810 --> 01:02:53,126
Speaker 1: All the end deckers taught me in my entire life of playing it with smart people.

985
01:02:53,548 --> 01:03:00,310
Speaker 1: is that one Humans fucking suck at pattern recognition and they fucking suck at managing risk.

986
