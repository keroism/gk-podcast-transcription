1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:12,853
Speaker 1: It's Thursday March 30th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:12,893 --> 00:00:15,080
Speaker 1: We review V for Vendetta the movie.

3
00:00:15,582 --> 00:00:16,688
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

4
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:23,860
Speaker 0: so today Scott got Calus Yep came home from work pull into the driveway, and then there's a FedEx truck in my way.

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:34,262
Speaker 0: And well I got out of the car says you Scott Reuben yep Gave me box and inside was the much anticipated hard-to-get board game Calus.

6
00:00:34,904 --> 00:00:35,747
Speaker 1: now we played it once.

7
00:00:35,807 --> 00:00:38,676
Speaker 1: we'll probably talk about it some Tuesday to come.

8
00:00:38,736 --> 00:00:39,940
Speaker 1: after we played it a little bit more.

9
00:00:40,582 --> 00:00:41,305
Speaker 0: Yeah, all we did.

10
00:00:41,325 --> 00:00:45,340
Speaker 0: we learned how to play and we pretty much figured out how everything works.

11
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:48,659
Speaker 0: I'm gonna read the rules a couple more times to make goddamn sure we don't mess it up.

12
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:53,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, we've gotten a little lazy and full of hubris when it comes to board game rules lately.

13
00:00:53,943 --> 00:01:00,308
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean apparently we've never played Amun Ray correctly And yet we played it hundreds of time.

14
00:01:00,348 --> 00:01:03,820
Speaker 1: the last last last time you played it online you played it correctly.

15
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:06,629
Speaker 0: I played it online two or three times correctly.

16
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:09,740
Speaker 0: now all right, and I haven't been able to win.

17
00:01:10,603 --> 00:01:11,988
Speaker 1: But anyway, that's for another day.

18
00:01:12,289 --> 00:01:13,714
Speaker 0: Yeah, I won Calus though you suck.

19
00:01:13,995 --> 00:01:15,039
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did lose Calus.

20
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:18,694
Speaker 1: However, I do think the two-player game is a little bit broken.

21
00:01:18,714 --> 00:01:19,920
Speaker 0: I think it's broken.

22
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,056
Speaker 0: I just think it is missing a lot of the exciting factors most of the factors.

23
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:33,980
Speaker 1: Yeah, anyway Yeah, so in the news The UMD format which is the format of disc that the PlayStation portable takes for watching movies and playing games.

24
00:01:34,964 --> 00:01:42,040
Speaker 1: Sony a while ago Claimed that they had shipped millions and millions millions and that in fact production could not keep up with demand.

25
00:01:42,622 --> 00:01:49,100
Speaker 1: It is now turned out that this was in fact a complete fabrication and UMDs are almost completely worthless.

26
00:01:50,063 --> 00:02:00,240
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean whenever I went to the store I kind of believed it because I saw so many movies on UMD I was like wow because originally I thought I would see maybe five UMD movies ever and that would be it.

27
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:03,212
Speaker 0: But you would go to the store, and there was a pretty decent selection.

28
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:05,260
Speaker 1: You know well according to Reuters.

29
00:02:05,762 --> 00:02:12,744
Speaker 1: Well first off no one no studio has so much as broken even on UMDs Let alone made a profit.

30
00:02:13,146 --> 00:02:17,260
Speaker 1: well not only that a universal is completely dropping it.

31
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,859
Speaker 1: They said that they've had almost zero sales.

32
00:02:19,262 --> 00:02:24,067
Speaker 1: Paramount completely dropping the format unless something crazy happens They've never made a profit is not worth it.

33
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:30,052
Speaker 1: image entertainment Buena Vista Fox home entertainment They're all getting rid of it or at least drastically scaling back.

34
00:02:30,072 --> 00:02:31,820
Speaker 1: there you a there UMD releases.

35
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:39,160
Speaker 0: You can't sell something in a digital or hardware format for which there is only one player.

36
00:02:39,701 --> 00:02:42,891
Speaker 1: Walmart is even dropping the the format entirely.

37
00:02:42,931 --> 00:02:43,874
Speaker 1: they won't carry him anymore.

38
00:02:43,894 --> 00:02:43,975
Speaker 1: Well.

39
00:02:43,995 --> 00:02:45,680
Speaker 0: They're gonna sell PSP games though.

40
00:02:45,781 --> 00:02:47,660
Speaker 1: So yeah, but they're not gonna sell UMD movies.

41
00:02:48,102 --> 00:02:52,320
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like I saw the bunch of them in stores, so I figured someone must be buying him.

42
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:56,818
Speaker 0: You know you go to GameStop, and it's like good almost a hundred UMD movies to choose from.

43
00:02:56,858 --> 00:03:01,054
Speaker 1: yeah apparently No one was buying them, and it was basically a factor of one.

44
00:03:01,455 --> 00:03:14,480
Speaker 1: Sony was really pushing them And it's rumored no one can prove this that Sony was probably paying people to put these things displayed prominently - Sony had a massive Marketing campaign trying to convince people that they were actually selling really well.

45
00:03:15,002 --> 00:03:18,718
Speaker 1: I mean you saw a while ago all the articles about how crazy well UMD was doing.

46
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:26,300
Speaker 0: and Yeah, I believe those because they saw so many in stores, but now I believe this because yeah I've never seen one in public.

47
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,816
Speaker 0: I've never seen a single person using a UMD movie in a PSP ever.

48
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:43,678
Speaker 1: now the thing is Sony I don't think was technically lying when they said that they've sold that many UMD movies because the number they claimed is the same reason why they always claimed that the PlayStation 2 or their games or whatever always sell so well or that the PSP is doing so well.

49
00:03:43,738 --> 00:03:48,040
Speaker 1: in general They only count the number of units that they have shipped to retailers.

50
00:03:48,744 --> 00:03:51,400
Speaker 1: They never say how many units have been sold to consumers.

51
00:03:51,861 --> 00:03:59,485
Speaker 1: So every store that carries UMDs has a giant giant stock of unsold ones that they can't sell for anything Mmm.

52
00:03:59,646 --> 00:04:01,520
Speaker 0: It's just screwed up the Sony.

53
00:04:02,062 --> 00:04:04,853
Speaker 0: We need to start a thing on a website that says the Sony tally.

54
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:07,486
Speaker 0: every time Sony gets worse We put a little check mark.

55
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:08,974
Speaker 1: I mean Sony's just done.

56
00:04:09,035 --> 00:04:11,384
Speaker 1: as far as I'm concerned They've got no product.

57
00:04:11,424 --> 00:04:15,655
Speaker 0: How can a company consistently time after time for the past?

58
00:04:15,695 --> 00:04:17,358
Speaker 0: I don't know how many years just do something?

59
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:23,137
Speaker 0: Since the ps2 everything that Sony has done has been bad for Sony that and bad for everyone else.

60
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:23,639
Speaker 1: Really.

61
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:31,647
Speaker 1: I think the place PSPs UMDs my raise see my thinking here is that one.

62
00:04:32,069 --> 00:04:33,212
Speaker 1: the PlayStation was a fluke.

63
00:04:33,613 --> 00:04:38,126
Speaker 1: it only succeeded like we've said many times because Square and Final Fantasy jumped shit.

64
00:04:38,507 --> 00:04:42,860
Speaker 1: the PlayStation 2 only succeeded because it came out real early.

65
00:04:43,503 --> 00:04:51,259
Speaker 1: it was significantly better than the PlayStation 1 and The Xbox really had a piss-poor showing early on and it was backwards compatible with the ps1.

66
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:55,286
Speaker 0: The Xbox didn't come out till lay way later Yep, plus the GameCube.

67
00:04:55,346 --> 00:05:04,180
Speaker 1: while it was doing reasonably well and Nintendo made very good profits on it I think people were kind of wary from the not quite as awesome and 64 as they had expected.

68
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:11,755
Speaker 0: Yeah, if the n64 would have had I don't know CDs and some Final Fantasies.

69
00:05:12,096 --> 00:05:22,976
Speaker 1: There would be no PlayStation Yeah, but anyway, Sony they just kind of dropped the ball in every single facet of their company this time around In the past five or six times around.

70
00:05:23,318 --> 00:05:24,927
Speaker 1: Yeah So anyway enough about this.

71
00:05:25,007 --> 00:05:25,188
Speaker 1: the.

72
00:05:25,248 --> 00:05:35,069
Speaker 1: the moral of the story is that UMD is a dead format And if you have a PSP You're actually probably in luck for now because you'll be able to buy every UMD out there for next to nothing In the coming few months.

73
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:35,512
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm.

74
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:44,412
Speaker 0: Well, okay There are a lot of people who like to quote this crazy old Study about how some people prayed for.

75
00:05:44,693 --> 00:05:47,020
Speaker 0: there's some about prayer healing and how it worked.

76
00:05:47,442 --> 00:05:49,899
Speaker 0: Of course that study has been debunked many many times.

77
00:05:50,881 --> 00:05:53,207
Speaker 0: Today there came out this study.

78
00:05:53,287 --> 00:05:55,633
Speaker 0: That is real science.

79
00:05:56,214 --> 00:06:05,020
Speaker 0: They took about 1800 patients 604 of them were prayed for and were being told that they may or may not be being prayed for.

80
00:06:05,141 --> 00:06:06,716
Speaker 0: So they didn't know if they were prayed for or not.

81
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,975
Speaker 1: now They were being prayed for a paracord as far as I can tell I'm gonna get to that by devout people who were who had Seared severely held beliefs.

82
00:06:14,036 --> 00:06:20,180
Speaker 0: Yes 597 people were not prayed for and they were told they might or may not being prayed for.

83
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,519
Speaker 0: So they didn't know if they were being prayed for or not, but they were.

84
00:06:24,061 --> 00:06:29,860
Speaker 0: Six hundred and one people were prayed for and we're told that they would be the subject of prayer.

85
00:06:30,462 --> 00:06:32,028
Speaker 0: So you pretty much covered all the bases.

86
00:06:32,048 --> 00:06:33,894
Speaker 0: you got your control you got your experience.

87
00:06:33,934 --> 00:06:39,509
Speaker 1: It's all perfect science and As perfect as science can be when you're studying something like that.

88
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:40,231
Speaker 1: Yeah.

89
00:06:40,331 --> 00:06:43,700
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you got six hundred people and three different groups.

90
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,340
Speaker 0: That's pretty statistically significant.

91
00:06:46,982 --> 00:06:52,020
Speaker 0: The praying was done by members of three Christian groups and monasteries and elsewhere to Catholic one Protestant.

92
00:06:52,381 --> 00:06:53,686
Speaker 0: They were given written prayers.

93
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:57,238
Speaker 0: the first name initial last name of the prayer subjects bla bla bla bla bla.

94
00:06:57,298 --> 00:06:57,760
Speaker 0: Who cares?

95
00:06:58,723 --> 00:07:03,940
Speaker 1: the results were The results were actually hilarious.

96
00:07:05,122 --> 00:07:07,230
Speaker 0: There was really no difference between any of the groups.

97
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:14,176
Speaker 1: Not only was there no statistical Statistically significant correlation whatsoever between prayer and healing.

98
00:07:14,698 --> 00:07:20,520
Speaker 1: but in fact If you look at the raw numbers people who were prayed for had a slightly higher rate of complications and death.

99
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:28,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, these are people who recently had heart surgery or bypass surgery and they you know, so that way there was no variation.

100
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:33,440
Speaker 0: It was all people who had recent bypass surgery and they wanted to see how well they did based on that.

101
00:07:33,882 --> 00:07:36,240
Speaker 0: So it wasn't like all kinds of illnesses across the board.

102
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:48,780
Speaker 0: It was one kind of illness and the people who were prayed for and knew it they had fifty nine percent more Though fifty nine percent of them had complications, which is a higher percentage of complications than any of the other groups.

103
00:07:49,161 --> 00:08:01,665
Speaker 1: Now, of course a study like this is hard to really vet scientifically mainly because every case was slightly different and unless you had an identical List of people who all had the exact same condition operated on by the same doctor, you know All that sort of thing.

104
00:08:01,968 --> 00:08:03,700
Speaker 1: There's really no way to make this study perfect.

105
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:14,233
Speaker 1: however a lot of people really like to quote that old batshit study that said prayer actually helped people heal and This is just one more chink in the fact that that study was complete bullshit.

106
00:08:14,253 --> 00:08:16,200
Speaker 1: It was never replicated ever by anyone.

107
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:19,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, and while this study isn't perfect, it's far less bullshit.

108
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:23,060
Speaker 0: In fact, it's pretty damn good as far as science goes.

109
00:08:29,244 --> 00:08:36,356
Speaker 1: so things of the day my thing of the day is Something that I thought was fairly interesting and I found it a long time ago.

110
00:08:36,437 --> 00:08:42,640
Speaker 1: Not a long time ago Maybe a couple weeks ago, but back then the link to the trailer for this movie was dead.

111
00:08:43,182 --> 00:08:46,153
Speaker 1: So I really wasn't sure if it was legitimate or hoax.

112
00:08:46,575 --> 00:08:47,760
Speaker 0: I think it's cuz it was dug.

113
00:08:48,364 --> 00:08:55,740
Speaker 1: Well now they're hosting the videos on YouTube So I was able to watch them and I have verified that at least as far as I can tell this is legitimate.

114
00:08:56,081 --> 00:08:58,850
Speaker 1: Basically a bunch of fans have gotten together and made a low budget.

115
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:01,800
Speaker 1: now low budget not no budget.

116
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:03,365
Speaker 1: There's a big distinction there.

117
00:09:03,806 --> 00:09:12,555
Speaker 1: Legend of Zelda movie called the hero of time and I got to say watching the trailer I'm fairly impressed with the level of production that they've put on.

118
00:09:12,575 --> 00:09:15,479
Speaker 0: I didn't see it So it's not much I can say about it.

119
00:09:15,742 --> 00:09:17,560
Speaker 1: It looks fairly badass and well done.

120
00:09:18,402 --> 00:09:25,723
Speaker 1: The makeup and the characters and everything looks amazing except the guy they got to play link looks kind of like a doof Mm-hmm.

121
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:28,075
Speaker 0: Is it like that fan-made Star Wars movie?

122
00:09:28,095 --> 00:09:29,000
Speaker 0: That was out a while ago.

123
00:09:29,181 --> 00:09:30,432
Speaker 0: You can watch on the internet for free.

124
00:09:30,453 --> 00:09:31,219
Speaker 1: a little bit.

125
00:09:31,421 --> 00:09:33,500
Speaker 1: I mean imagine a really well done looking movie.

126
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,396
Speaker 1: I mean the trailer looks not professional but definitely very much above average.

127
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:39,664
Speaker 1: the show You know, it's like awesome scene.

128
00:09:39,765 --> 00:09:42,112
Speaker 1: awesome scene cool guy and makeup.

129
00:09:42,755 --> 00:09:43,557
Speaker 1: Oh, there's link.

130
00:09:43,577 --> 00:09:45,624
Speaker 1: He's a doof Fighting scene.

131
00:09:45,684 --> 00:09:46,828
Speaker 1: guy on a horse in the distance.

132
00:09:46,969 --> 00:09:47,831
Speaker 1: Oh link in the distance.

133
00:09:47,851 --> 00:09:48,393
Speaker 1: He looks good.

134
00:09:48,895 --> 00:09:49,798
Speaker 1: Oh link up close.

135
00:09:49,838 --> 00:09:56,399
Speaker 1: He's a doof Mm-hmm, but honestly, I kind of want to see this and I'm kind of looking forward to it.

136
00:09:56,833 --> 00:10:03,160
Speaker 0: Yeah I was looking forward to that Star Wars fan-made movie and then I watched it and it was really just a video fanfic.

137
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:10,659
Speaker 0: Everyone in it was like a scary person you see at a sci-fi convention and it can't be as scary as those Star Trek people We saw at ubercon.

138
00:10:11,141 --> 00:10:17,500
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean they had pretty high production values in that that Star Wars one and they had CG scenes of spaceships and everything.

139
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,248
Speaker 1: Yeah, the Zelda one has a lot of CG.

140
00:10:19,469 --> 00:10:21,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, they're done filming and they're just finishing up the CG.

141
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:26,551
Speaker 0: Yeah, but it was still a little painful to watch And I couldn't sit through the whole thing.

142
00:10:26,932 --> 00:10:28,580
Speaker 0: So we'll see if I can sit through this whole thing.

143
00:10:28,981 --> 00:10:29,845
Speaker 1: I think it's pretty cool.

144
00:10:30,206 --> 00:10:33,098
Speaker 1: I'd like to see it and maybe if you see the trailer, you'll change your mind.

145
00:10:33,379 --> 00:10:37,359
Speaker 0: or Yeah, yeah, it better be free though not paying for it.

146
00:10:37,741 --> 00:10:38,123
Speaker 1: Well, don't?

147
00:10:38,143 --> 00:10:41,720
Speaker 1: the only thing they have is they have a PayPal donate but it's not very prominent.

148
00:10:42,101 --> 00:10:46,640
Speaker 0: Yeah, anyway, so I'm not exactly sure where this robot is from.

149
00:10:47,141 --> 00:10:51,515
Speaker 0: Yeah, you might have seen a thread about, you know, robot ninja pirate, etc, etc.

150
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:52,679
Speaker 0: Well, this is about robot.

151
00:10:53,981 --> 00:10:56,651
Speaker 0: I think it's from the Robo one competition or something.

152
00:10:57,294 --> 00:10:58,900
Speaker 0: Basically, it's a little tiny robot.

153
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:03,640
Speaker 0: I'm not sure if it's remote controlled or not because the sites in Japanese it probably is remote controlled.

154
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:14,397
Speaker 0: I'm thinking Scott found this literally five minutes before we went on the air So he doesn't have any idea except there's a video of the robot in action fighting other robots with robot kung fu.

155
00:11:14,438 --> 00:11:24,315
Speaker 0: and I must say If the world were only robots and only robots that exist for real count This is currently the kung fu master of the whole world.

156
00:11:24,395 --> 00:11:25,460
Speaker 1: this robots badass

157
00:11:26,204 --> 00:11:41,580
Speaker 0: Like it literally like uses the same techniques a couple times But it has like three or four good techniques for knocking other robots down and like towards the end of the video It fights a robot that's bigger than itself and weighs twice as much and it still manages to knock it down.

158
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:47,218
Speaker 0: And when the robot falls on its back It does that little kung fu trick where you like you put your legs up in the air and then you flip up.

159
00:11:47,962 --> 00:11:49,346
Speaker 0: It's it's pretty awesome.

160
00:11:49,467 --> 00:11:53,100
Speaker 0: Yeah, and also like all the other robots are kind of slow and doofy.

161
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,772
Speaker 0: This one's like dancing around like Muhammad Ali like me.

162
00:11:57,214 --> 00:11:58,799
Speaker 1: I'll note that you said doofy.

163
00:11:59,661 --> 00:12:00,959
Speaker 1: That's a word you would never say.

164
00:12:01,462 --> 00:12:10,939
Speaker 1: I would submit in fact that the fact that I use the word so many times in my previous bit Virally implanted your brain to say that word could be doof doofus.

165
00:12:11,749 --> 00:12:15,772
Speaker 1: So it's Thursday And as we promised we're here to talk about V for Vendetta the movie

166
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:26,279
Speaker 0: and then we'll cross the spoiler line Just like yesterday where beyond that line You probably shouldn't listen unless you've seen it and we'll probably draw some comparisons between the movie and the comic and such-and-such.

167
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:31,619
Speaker 1: Yep, now for starters, we'll go real briefly over this because we know some people don't listen to all days of the show.

168
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:37,220
Speaker 1: But V for Vendetta was a comic first by Alan Moore and art by David Lloyd and you should read it.

169
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:38,598
Speaker 1: It's a very good comic.

170
00:12:38,961 --> 00:12:39,162
Speaker 1: You could.

171
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:44,020
Speaker 1: you should listen to yesterday's episode if you want to know more about it as we talked about it in fairly great detail.

172
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:47,919
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you don't even if you don't like comics, you should read this one.

173
00:12:48,502 --> 00:12:51,492
Speaker 0: Probably I would have to suggest after you read them after you watch the movie.

174
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:55,046
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean I read it Immediately before the movie.

175
00:12:55,167 --> 00:13:01,339
Speaker 1: as in I read it I finished it we got in the car and went to the theater Mm-hmm, but I think they both stand on their own.

176
00:13:01,643 --> 00:13:02,819
Speaker 0: They do both stand on their own.

177
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:07,540
Speaker 1: Having having one of them ruin what happens at the end for you does not ruin the other one by any means.

178
00:13:07,782 --> 00:13:08,489
Speaker 0: No, not at all.

179
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:09,116
Speaker 0: Not at all.

180
00:13:09,963 --> 00:13:13,584
Speaker 0: But I got to say that like I can imagine someone like me We're like.

181
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:15,539
Speaker 0: I saw the Akira movie and it was great.

182
00:13:15,921 --> 00:13:18,692
Speaker 0: Then I read the Akira manga and that was a zillion great.

183
00:13:19,114 --> 00:13:21,813
Speaker 0: and then I saw the Akira movie again And it wasn't as great.

184
00:13:21,914 --> 00:13:23,223
Speaker 0: as a result I can't.

185
00:13:23,423 --> 00:13:31,280
Speaker 0: I can imagine some people also being kind of like me in where if you read the Comic first and then see the movie it won't be as great.

186
00:13:31,702 --> 00:13:35,240
Speaker 0: But I can't imagine anyone seeing the movie and then that making the comic less great.

187
00:13:35,461 --> 00:13:38,580
Speaker 1: Yeah, except maybe with a fake computer thing that I think was dumb but quiet.

188
00:13:39,243 --> 00:13:41,191
Speaker 0: Keep going on about how you think the fake computer was dumb.

189
00:13:41,312 --> 00:13:44,311
Speaker 1: I just don't think it really belonged in the story But we'll talk about it later.

190
00:13:44,331 --> 00:13:44,675
Speaker 1: All right.

191
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,824
Speaker 1: All right But anyway to real real.

192
00:13:46,864 --> 00:13:49,491
Speaker 1: briefly V for Vendetta the comic and the movie.

193
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:56,788
Speaker 1: it's about a guy literally a guy Guy Fawkes G UI FAW KES.

194
00:13:56,868 --> 00:14:00,280
Speaker 1: now, if you don't know who Guy Fawkes is one I have I pity your soul.

195
00:14:00,563 --> 00:14:02,079
Speaker 0: You are not an intelligent person.

196
00:14:03,121 --> 00:14:11,028
Speaker 1: It's a. it's a. it's a British holiday based on the fact that a long time ago a man named Guy Fawkes Tried to blow up Parliament almost got a member.

197
00:14:11,068 --> 00:14:15,902
Speaker 1: Remember the 5th of November of gunpowder treason and plot, you know that old rhyme Really?

198
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:16,464
Speaker 0: I know it.

199
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:21,139
Speaker 0: Yeah, but really this guy put barrels of gunpowder under the Parliament building and tried to blow it up.

200
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:32,626
Speaker 0: like imagine if some terrorists Tried to blow up the White House and they caught them like a minute before it blew up like these guys are standing under the White House literally with bombs.

201
00:14:32,826 --> 00:14:37,807
Speaker 0: and then we caught them and then we made a holiday about it and we celebrated it for hundreds of years Afterwards.

202
00:14:38,231 --> 00:14:39,039
Speaker 0: so we didn't forget.

203
00:14:39,941 --> 00:14:48,880
Speaker 1: Now in this story, it's set in a 1984 ish kind of futuristic Alternate history kind of world very realistic future not laser guns and all that.

204
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:52,159
Speaker 0: But yeah, this it's sort of like a near future the movie, right?

205
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:56,837
Speaker 1: So now definitely the movie is is set further in the future than the comic.

206
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,263
Speaker 0: Yeah Oh, absolutely.

207
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:05,008
Speaker 1: more importantly it draws heavily on current events extrapolate what we're doing right now in the world Forward 20 or 40 years.

208
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:20,534
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I mean The comic is sort of set in what they thought the late 90s would be like in the 80s and the movie is Set in what we thought think like the 2010s might be like or the 2015s might be like now.

209
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:26,049
Speaker 1: now in this 1984 ish Fascist society like no bones about it fascist.

210
00:15:26,490 --> 00:15:27,714
Speaker 1: Yeah, not even kidding.

211
00:15:27,754 --> 00:15:31,023
Speaker 1: They don't even it's like alright look fascism Mm-hmm.

212
00:15:31,505 --> 00:15:40,297
Speaker 1: and the guy the main character or at least the motive character V Who wears the Guy Fawkes mask basically goes to blow up Parliament again.

213
00:15:40,317 --> 00:15:41,019
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

214
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:48,715
Speaker 0: Well, actually in the comic it's the first difference is that right at the beginning of the comic blows up Parliament But right at the beginning of the movie he blows up.

215
00:15:48,976 --> 00:15:49,740
Speaker 0: What's the name of the building?

216
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:51,465
Speaker 1: Oh, I don't remember what he blows up.

217
00:15:51,646 --> 00:15:54,940
Speaker 1: take the Barbary the one with the statue of justice on top of it.

218
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,240
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, well, we'll talk about the main differences between the comic and the movie later because that involves a lot of spoilers.

219
00:16:01,481 --> 00:16:06,979
Speaker 1: Yep, but he's basically a revolutionary trying to undermine this fascist society.

220
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:09,344
Speaker 1: and That's the movie.

221
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:11,492
Speaker 1: I can't really go into much more without spoiling a lot.

222
00:16:11,914 --> 00:16:12,135
Speaker 0: Yeah.

223
00:16:12,255 --> 00:16:13,440
Speaker 0: Well, there's some other characters.

224
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:16,230
Speaker 0: They're the the fascist guys trying to stop him.

225
00:16:16,451 --> 00:16:19,527
Speaker 1: Yeah, the leaders of all the various government agencies Mm-hmm.

226
00:16:19,891 --> 00:16:23,553
Speaker 0: There's a The girl Evie who's sort of the main character.

227
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:35,492
Speaker 1: Yeah, she's definitely the Movie seems to be very much from her Perspective or from these perspective or from the third main character or at least main Protagonist character the good detective guy.

228
00:16:35,512 --> 00:16:44,103
Speaker 0: Yeah, the good detective guy He's like I selected a favorite guy and he's definitely portrayed in a good better light in the movie than he is in the comic I don't know.

229
00:16:44,143 --> 00:16:45,690
Speaker 0: I think in the comic he was also portrayed.

230
00:16:45,771 --> 00:16:47,277
Speaker 0: I mean, oh he was he was.

231
00:16:47,338 --> 00:16:52,012
Speaker 1: I definitely agree He was pretty in a good light But it definitely seems like the movie was much the comic.

232
00:16:52,072 --> 00:16:57,792
Speaker 1: the I. the fact that you know things like Larkhill Existed was much more commonly known and accepted and in the movie.

233
00:16:57,812 --> 00:17:01,765
Speaker 1: It was more of a. this was a government secret Mm-hmm, things like that.

234
00:17:01,805 --> 00:17:03,008
Speaker 1: little things best.

235
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,018
Speaker 0: That's definitely my favorite guy in both versions.

236
00:17:06,178 --> 00:17:09,972
Speaker 1: Yes Somewhat different decision in the end of both of them though.

237
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:11,198
Speaker 0: He does sort of make.

238
00:17:11,238 --> 00:17:11,660
Speaker 1: that's fine.

239
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,869
Speaker 0: I think that's also because the circumstances were different.

240
00:17:15,011 --> 00:17:17,720
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, the movie just goes from there.

241
00:17:18,142 --> 00:17:25,311
Speaker 1: so you've got the fascist future society and the Revolutionary going at it and this is a.

242
00:17:25,413 --> 00:17:27,400
Speaker 0: the screenplay was written by the matrix dudes.

243
00:17:28,044 --> 00:17:30,760
Speaker 0: So there's a lot of cool knife fighting awesome.

244
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:31,138
Speaker 0: Yeah.

245
00:17:31,361 --> 00:17:43,246
Speaker 1: If you've read V for vendetta his main means of killing people because we'll make no bones about it in both the movie in the comic He is introduced immediately as the villain and he goes around Fucking killing people with knives

246
00:17:43,667 --> 00:17:47,920
Speaker 0: lots of knives throwing knives stabbing knives pointy fancy knives.

247
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:51,019
Speaker 1: He kills people and he makes no bones about it.

248
00:17:51,321 --> 00:17:52,969
Speaker 1: I mean there are scenes where so he's.

249
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:54,657
Speaker 1: someone asks him like are you going to kill me?

250
00:17:54,717 --> 00:17:57,487
Speaker 1: and he says yes And then he kills them with knives.

251
00:17:58,089 --> 00:17:59,173
Speaker 1: or did you kill that guy?

252
00:17:59,314 --> 00:17:59,554
Speaker 1: Yeah.

253
00:17:59,595 --> 00:18:00,458
Speaker 1: Did you blow up Parliament?

254
00:18:00,478 --> 00:18:01,020
Speaker 1: Yeah, I did that.

255
00:18:01,521 --> 00:18:02,243
Speaker 1: Yeah, what of it?

256
00:18:03,005 --> 00:18:09,701
Speaker 1: It's good stuff, but the final knife fighting scene in the movie is very matrix Styling.

257
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:12,380
Speaker 0: Yeah, like I saw it coming a mile away.

258
00:18:12,621 --> 00:18:22,823
Speaker 0: So that way it's like it's like here it comes and then you stop and you start to pay attention and watch Every single second of knife Action,

259
00:18:22,843 --> 00:18:33,293
Speaker 1: of course despite the fact that V kills a lot of people throughout the course of this movie I was very sympathetic toward V. In fact, I would hope that most of you out there would also be.

260
00:18:33,313 --> 00:18:35,983
Speaker 0: I think that's sort of the point is It's one of those things.

261
00:18:36,024 --> 00:18:47,491
Speaker 0: so they take a bat the guy who's you're not supposed to be all friendly with or a guy Who's sort of the bad guy and then they make you feel like the bad guy or like the bad guy and it's and then you I'm liking the bad guy.

262
00:18:47,531 --> 00:18:48,135
Speaker 0: Am I bad?

263
00:18:48,276 --> 00:18:52,247
Speaker 0: Oh my god It's one of those sorts of things.

264
00:18:53,130 --> 00:19:06,040
Speaker 1: now the movie that there are a lot of themes in the movie but the movie very much is Looking at our current political situation mostly in the United States actually And in a very direct way showing how it's bad.

265
00:19:06,481 --> 00:19:10,773
Speaker 0: I mean, this is the most blatant metaphor analogy stuff I've ever ever seen.

266
00:19:10,873 --> 00:19:13,200
Speaker 0: it's like that guy is Bush.

267
00:19:13,642 --> 00:19:17,240
Speaker 0: He's scaring all the people into doing what he wants and making war.

268
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:21,720
Speaker 0: The people have to rise up and make him stop because we don't want it to be that way.

269
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:28,280
Speaker 1: Yes, now the book involved a lot of ideas as we talked about yesterday, you know transhumanism and etc.

270
00:19:29,203 --> 00:19:30,748
Speaker 1: Now the movie is much more distilled.

271
00:19:31,028 --> 00:19:34,620
Speaker 1: the main driving idea behind the movie seems to be the political ideas.

272
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:39,673
Speaker 1: Yeah the ideas of freedom greater than fascism freedom freedom greater than all.

273
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:42,823
Speaker 1: and the quote that I just love quoting Governments.

274
00:19:43,245 --> 00:19:43,807
Speaker 1: people should not.

275
00:19:43,828 --> 00:19:44,591
Speaker 1: I keep saying wrong.

276
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:46,760
Speaker 1: people should not be afraid of their governments.

277
00:19:47,222 --> 00:19:48,827
Speaker 1: Governments should be afraid of their people.

278
00:19:48,887 --> 00:19:50,633
Speaker 0: I think they use that in the trailer actually.

279
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:54,465
Speaker 1: Yes, and it is spoken very Poignantly in the movie.

280
00:19:55,007 --> 00:19:59,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like they stop and then he says it slowly and loudly and then they stop again.

281
00:19:59,641 --> 00:20:00,493
Speaker 0: It's like there it is.

282
00:20:00,513 --> 00:20:02,285
Speaker 0: Aha Yeah, there are a lot of.

283
00:20:02,486 --> 00:20:06,040
Speaker 0: the movie does I think touch on a lot more points than just the political stuff.

284
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:17,120
Speaker 0: But it's sort of like they touch on one to go back to the politics They touching another one back to the politics Like the comic was definitely more the I the ideology of freedom and anarchy and then everything else was secondary to that.

285
00:20:17,625 --> 00:20:19,342
Speaker 1: the movie is Political.

286
00:20:19,804 --> 00:20:22,072
Speaker 1: Wow America and Bush are bad.

287
00:20:22,514 --> 00:20:24,099
Speaker 1: all this other cool stuff along with it.

288
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:34,636
Speaker 0: Yeah, someone had told me I saw it on the internet somewhere that The comic book is anarchy verse fascism, but that the movie he said it was liberal verse conservative.

289
00:20:35,158 --> 00:20:37,390
Speaker 0: after watching the movie I don't think I can agree with that.

290
00:20:37,451 --> 00:20:41,946
Speaker 0: I think it's more fascism verse Getting rid of fascism.

291
00:20:42,267 --> 00:20:42,528
Speaker 0: Yes.

292
00:20:42,628 --> 00:20:44,215
Speaker 0: The enemy is definitely absent.

293
00:20:44,376 --> 00:20:46,599
Speaker 1: We won't talk about the end yet We're not at the spoiler line.

294
00:20:46,680 --> 00:21:01,320
Speaker 1: but the end of the movie while Essentially is the same as the end of the comic in terms of the ideas and what happens and the sense you get at the End it stops just short of making the full point that the comic made which I'm not saying is it go to a bad thing?

295
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:08,308
Speaker 1: But it definitely stops short and makes a slightly different point a slightly less Biting point or less bad medicine.

296
00:21:09,031 --> 00:21:11,260
Speaker 0: I think pretty much the the movie.

297
00:21:11,762 --> 00:21:16,880
Speaker 0: It wasn't the people trying to make the movie weren't just trying to take the comic and make a movie out of it.

298
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:29,559
Speaker 0: they were trying to you know change the opinions or put some ideas into the populace that is watching this movie and As a result, you know, they made some decisions that changed it and that's where the anarchy went.

299
00:21:29,719 --> 00:21:34,440
Speaker 1: Yep Now I do believe that a lot of those decisions were well done and I think that the movie overall was very well done.

300
00:21:34,721 --> 00:21:35,827
Speaker 1: I'm very impressed with it.

301
00:21:36,289 --> 00:21:37,495
Speaker 0: It's better than a lot of movies.

302
00:21:37,555 --> 00:21:44,340
Speaker 1: I seen they can't deny Yep, and honestly I expected them to dumb it down and soften the edges a lot more than they did.

303
00:21:44,902 --> 00:21:50,740
Speaker 1: I mean early on in the comic the main girl Evie is a prostitute or she's going to be a prostitute straight out of process.

304
00:21:51,001 --> 00:21:53,560
Speaker 0: She's she's going she's like a waitress or something.

305
00:21:53,560 --> 00:22:00,126
Speaker 0: You're short on money and she goes out to prostitute herself for the first time ever in the movie and these aren't spoilers happens Right away in the movie.

306
00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:00,890
Speaker 1: that doesn't happen.

307
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:02,740
Speaker 1: It's something completely - it's something similar.

308
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:04,646
Speaker 1: But they don't come right out and say it.

309
00:22:05,028 --> 00:22:06,513
Speaker 1: Yeah, but other than that they don't.

310
00:22:06,553 --> 00:22:06,854
Speaker 1: I mean like.

311
00:22:06,874 --> 00:22:12,293
Speaker 1: there's the priest in both And pretty much his lines are identical in both the comic and the movie.

312
00:22:12,313 --> 00:22:13,477
Speaker 0: Yeah, I thought that was pretty funny.

313
00:22:13,658 --> 00:22:14,280
Speaker 0: the priest guy.

314
00:22:14,781 --> 00:22:17,970
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean basically there's this priest and he hired.

315
00:22:18,050 --> 00:22:21,840
Speaker 1: basically he's hired a prostitute girl and his advisors like.

316
00:22:22,484 --> 00:22:23,430
Speaker 1: I'm sorry, sir.

317
00:22:23,691 --> 00:22:25,040
Speaker 1: There was a mix-up at the agency.

318
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:32,777
Speaker 1: She's not as young as you like and he's like, oh dear and the guy's like, yeah, she's 15 We're sorry.

319
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,660
Speaker 0: Yeah, did Evie in the movie seem a lot older?

320
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:42,841
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah in the cut Evie in the comic is supposed to be like 16 or 17.

321
00:22:42,841 --> 00:22:47,940
Speaker 1: Yeah, Evie seemed more like me our age like mid 20s kind of deal in the movie.

322
00:22:48,242 --> 00:22:50,557
Speaker 0: Maybe that's just because the actor is that old and they couldn't really.

323
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,448
Speaker 1: yeah I think that was part of it and it just.

324
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:59,297
Speaker 1: it seemed to work better because they definitely made Evie a much Stronger character in the movie in terms of her fear of mental willpower.

325
00:22:59,377 --> 00:23:00,240
Speaker 0: Well, she's a good actor.

326
00:23:00,280 --> 00:23:02,288
Speaker 0: So I really don't think they could have chosen anyone better.

327
00:23:02,408 --> 00:23:05,340
Speaker 0: so better to just change the age which didn't matter so much.

328
00:23:05,581 --> 00:23:10,241
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know except it only makes it kind of silly when she's trying to pass for 15.

329
00:23:10,241 --> 00:23:13,915
Speaker 1: But other than that, yeah, but you know what they do that scene really well.

330
00:23:13,955 --> 00:23:14,618
Speaker 0: Yeah, other than that.

331
00:23:14,638 --> 00:23:15,240
Speaker 0: It doesn't matter.

332
00:23:15,401 --> 00:23:19,060
Speaker 1: So yeah, but I guess the movie is not to be taken lightly.

333
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:27,517
Speaker 1: It is definitely not soft around the edges as you might expect And there's a lot of brutality a lot of blood a lot of murder a lot of death a lot of terrorism.

334
00:23:27,537 --> 00:23:34,440
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yeah, it's like I figured you know, they wouldn't show certain things or certain things you modified but they you know.

335
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,528
Speaker 0: It's like when they do soften something.

336
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:48,948
Speaker 0: if you've read the comic you notice it and it may or may not bother you But they do it less frequently than you would guess just reading the comic and trying to say oh they'll soften that they'll soften that And really a lot of.

337
00:23:49,229 --> 00:23:56,240
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't want to make this a political show right now But even though you all know our political feelings mostly they're unlike any other.

338
00:23:57,641 --> 00:24:05,569
Speaker 1: But the way they handle the politics and the way they set it up if any of the Conservative leaders in America actually see this movie.

339
00:24:05,589 --> 00:24:07,034
Speaker 1: They're going to be incredibly pissed.

340
00:24:07,094 --> 00:24:08,940
Speaker 0: I think I think they're already pissed.

341
00:24:09,221 --> 00:24:12,820
Speaker 1: I mean, I've seen some rumblings already on FARC and such about this movie.

342
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:17,237
Speaker 0: There is a chance that they're so incredibly dumb that they don't realize that this movie's saying.

343
00:24:17,297 --> 00:24:19,831
Speaker 0: but yeah I don't know how you could be that dumb.

344
00:24:19,851 --> 00:24:32,140
Speaker 1: and I mean I'll go out on a limb right now and say that this movie is a an Indictment against the Republican Party and George W Bush and the government of the United States and the comic is not.

345
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:35,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, the comic is much broader than that and much more timeless.

346
00:24:36,251 --> 00:24:38,597
Speaker 1: This is definitely Wow America.

347
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:40,583
Speaker 1: Oh my god What WTF?

348
00:24:41,144 --> 00:24:49,759
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the one thing I have to say is that I don't think and maybe there if we're still still world in 50 years, I don't think the movie will make as much sense.

349
00:24:50,362 --> 00:24:53,679
Speaker 0: Unless you know during like this movie wouldn't have made so much sense.

350
00:24:54,263 --> 00:24:57,339
Speaker 0: Say in the mid 90s when Clinton was around, you know, we would have been like, huh?

351
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:04,173
Speaker 1: See, I think it would have though because then if they would have just it would have felt more like a 1984 kind of Deal, maybe maybe not who knows?

352
00:25:04,716 --> 00:25:05,240
Speaker 1: it's hard to say.

353
00:25:05,361 --> 00:25:08,637
Speaker 1: All I know is that in the world we live in now this movie.

354
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:16,391
Speaker 1: if Anyone out there who is very right-wing doesn't think this movie is about them for good or ill well done or not You've got to watch the movie again.

355
00:25:16,411 --> 00:25:20,368
Speaker 0: Yeah The movie is basically Republican suck.

356
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,877
Speaker 0: Yeah, it doesn't really say Democrats good though.

357
00:25:22,897 --> 00:25:23,860
Speaker 0: It just says Republican suck.

358
00:25:24,121 --> 00:25:25,428
Speaker 1: Yeah, because it does.

359
00:25:25,448 --> 00:25:27,619
Speaker 1: that's the one thing the movie stopped short on at the end.

360
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:33,997
Speaker 1: Is that at the end the pivotal event happens, but unlike the comic it doesn't follow through with the.

361
00:25:34,098 --> 00:25:38,115
Speaker 1: here's the alternative Mm-hmm, which I don't know if it matters or not.

362
00:25:38,155 --> 00:25:39,040
Speaker 1: It depends on your taste.

363
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:41,711
Speaker 1: We'll talk about that more when we pass the spoiler line.

364
00:25:41,952 --> 00:25:43,659
Speaker 0: Should we bring that spoiler line right up now?

365
00:25:44,346 --> 00:25:44,972
Speaker 1: I think we're yeah.

366
00:25:44,992 --> 00:25:50,359
Speaker 1: at the point of spoiler I'll just say one last thing for all of you out there who haven't seen the movie that go see it.

367
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:54,210
Speaker 1: V for Vendetta is a fantastic movie and a minimum rent it.

368
00:25:54,752 --> 00:26:00,468
Speaker 1: the fact that Scott and I went to the theater to see it Speaks volumes because we hate movie theaters.

369
00:26:01,029 --> 00:26:04,820
Speaker 0: Yeah, and actually let's talk about that for before we cross the official spoiler line.

370
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,985
Speaker 1: All right, god damn it ads.

371
00:26:06,968 --> 00:26:09,378
Speaker 0: I hate the movie theater still god damn it.

372
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:19,600
Speaker 1: now I like the movie theater I go to in New York City all the time because one I always watch anime movies there and two they don't show ads they Just show trailers for other like art house type movies.

373
00:26:19,842 --> 00:26:20,590
Speaker 0: I think that's the thing is.

374
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:25,640
Speaker 0: in an art house type movie You don't show ads and the people there are people there who want to watch the movie.

375
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:28,976
Speaker 0: They're not you know, I don't want to say this but the dregs of society.

376
00:26:28,996 --> 00:26:31,548
Speaker 1: Yeah, luckily We didn't run into too many dregs on Sunday.

377
00:26:31,749 --> 00:26:36,569
Speaker 0: It wasn't as bad as it could be actually, you know There wasn't anyone yelling or talking so loud.

378
00:26:36,609 --> 00:26:39,580
Speaker 1: There was some kid next to me eating candy out of a crinkly bag.

379
00:26:40,021 --> 00:26:41,204
Speaker 0: Oh, I hate the crinkly.

380
00:26:41,625 --> 00:26:42,788
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the worst.

381
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:43,229
Speaker 0: Especially.

382
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:46,617
Speaker 0: I remember in college people kids would have those like potato chip bags.

383
00:26:46,637 --> 00:26:48,847
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, ugly.

384
00:26:49,513 --> 00:26:50,160
Speaker 0: Oh, that's painful.

385
00:26:50,603 --> 00:26:54,347
Speaker 1: But honestly them if you're gonna go see a movie in a theater The movie is actually worth seeing in a theater.

386
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:57,820
Speaker 0: I'd say if you can get a cheap maybe the dollar theater for sure.

387
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:01,538
Speaker 1: No, yeah, I might go see it again at a dollar theater again in the dollar.

388
00:27:01,558 --> 00:27:06,158
Speaker 1: Yeah Now that I've seen it and I know exactly the differences I'd like to read the comic again and then watch it again.

389
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:12,600
Speaker 0: You know while this may not I don't think it was as good as you know Some other movies like Lord of the Rings or whatever that I would pay to see in the theater.

390
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:23,660
Speaker 0: But it's so much better than every other movie that's been in the theater for months and months And it's probably gonna be in the theater for months and months That if you don't go see it, you're probably not gonna be in the theater for like a year.

391
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:28,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you're anything if you're anyone like us at least plus honestly, you know voting with your dollars.

392
00:27:29,244 --> 00:27:30,099
Speaker 1: This is a good movie.

393
00:27:30,401 --> 00:27:33,820
Speaker 1: So if this movie makes a lot of money compared to all the crap movies out there right now

394
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:40,926
Speaker 0: You'll see a lot more movies based on comic books and the guy who wrote Watchmen will be even and Veeve will be even More pissed off because they'll make a Watchmen movie.

395
00:27:41,347 --> 00:27:45,280
Speaker 1: Even though meanwhile we saw the trailers and one they're remaking the Poseidon adventure.

396
00:27:45,361 --> 00:27:46,799
Speaker 1: I don't know what I think about that.

397
00:27:47,002 --> 00:27:52,092
Speaker 0: I never saw the Poseidon adventure But my general opinion of remakes is eh and two.

398
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:53,717
Speaker 1: we saw a trailer for a movie.

399
00:27:53,878 --> 00:27:54,560
Speaker 1: What was it called?

400
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:57,953
Speaker 0: I already forgot but one that was kind of like a snatch ripoff.

401
00:27:57,973 --> 00:27:59,299
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's this movie coming out.

402
00:27:59,319 --> 00:28:02,690
Speaker 0: Oh Lucky number 11 lucky number 11.

403
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:05,360
Speaker 1: It looks it's almost exactly like snatch.

404
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,198
Speaker 0: It looks like snatch plus America minus the number of characters though.

405
00:28:10,218 --> 00:28:10,720
Speaker 1: There might be more.

406
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,563
Speaker 1: I mean that was just a trailer but that movie I think we're gonna see that movie I was sold.

407
00:28:14,784 --> 00:28:16,448
Speaker 0: see I thought it was just a snatch ripoff.

408
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:25,477
Speaker 0: So I was kind of lukewarm and now I'm slightly less Cautiously optimistic than I was about Vee, but then they were like there's a guy named a rabbi.

409
00:28:25,517 --> 00:28:25,899
Speaker 0: Yeah, like.

410
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:30,020
Speaker 1: alright They're like, there's this other crime boss who lives across the street that zooms in on him snatch style.

411
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,332
Speaker 1: It's like the rabbi and then classic snatch kind of line.

412
00:28:33,593 --> 00:28:34,577
Speaker 1: Why do they call him the rabbi?

413
00:28:34,697 --> 00:28:35,400
Speaker 0: Cuz he's a rabbi.

414
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:40,309
Speaker 1: Alright anyway go CV for vendetta.

415
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,053
Speaker 1: It's well worth it.

416
00:28:41,193 --> 00:28:45,213
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, the most exciting trailer I saw was there's a Beastie Boys movie gonna coming out.

417
00:28:45,314 --> 00:28:48,388
Speaker 0: I'm totally getting that Download or DVD or something.

418
00:28:48,689 --> 00:28:51,280
Speaker 1: Beastie Boys are gonna let the beat drop.

419
00:28:51,983 --> 00:29:01,369
Speaker 1: All right, all right spoiler line, all right from this point forward We are going to spoil both the comic and the movie of no land for vendetta.

420
00:29:01,389 --> 00:29:04,750
Speaker 1: All right Spoilers spoilers spoiler.

421
00:29:04,830 --> 00:29:08,728
Speaker 1: do not keep listening If you do not want V for vendetta to be spoiled.

422
00:29:08,929 --> 00:29:14,164
Speaker 0: if you haven't seen both the comic and the movie and you care Don't keep listening.

423
00:29:14,465 --> 00:29:16,009
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think we've given you enough time.

424
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:16,912
Speaker 0: All right, that's it.

425
00:29:17,233 --> 00:29:17,574
Speaker 1: All right.

426
00:29:17,995 --> 00:29:23,330
Speaker 1: So in bow dies at the end But the fact that V dies in both of them was good.

427
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:25,380
Speaker 0: I was worried and he dies in the same way.

428
00:29:25,661 --> 00:29:30,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was very worried as the movie got toward the end that they were gonna take V's mask off.

429
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:31,880
Speaker 0: I was very worried about that.

430
00:29:32,001 --> 00:29:39,369
Speaker 1: Also that would have like killed the whole thing Like I would have been disgusted if that had happened and the fact that they did they didn't Despite the fact that that's a very.

431
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:41,400
Speaker 1: I don't want to sound prejudiced against Americans.

432
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:45,079
Speaker 1: That's definitely something that Americans in general would probably have wanted to have seen.

433
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:58,495
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm, at least people who if people were watching the movie because people who read the comic I mean if you're already bought this comic or got it from the library or something You're already smart enough that you're gonna get it, you know, or at least get the main point.

434
00:29:58,816 --> 00:30:01,239
Speaker 0: if you're in a movie theater I mean, this is the number one movie this week.

435
00:30:01,421 --> 00:30:02,814
Speaker 0: There are people who went to see it who are.

436
00:30:02,956 --> 00:30:08,980
Speaker 0: obviously There's at least someone who's not smart enough to get it and that person is still thinking they want to see what's behind the mask.

437
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:14,203
Speaker 1: Well also in the comic book in case you didn't realize it about the mask It goes into.

438
00:30:14,263 --> 00:30:24,509
Speaker 1: there's a whole page where they show like she imagines herself taking off the mask and seeing a face Mm-hmm, and then they backpedal like no that was just in her head and then she does it again And it's a different face and she does it again.

439
00:30:24,549 --> 00:30:25,253
Speaker 1: It's a different face.

440
00:30:25,353 --> 00:30:26,660
Speaker 0: Well in the movie they do the same thing.

441
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,024
Speaker 0: She's like the.

442
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,788
Speaker 0: the detective is like who was he?

443
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:34,300
Speaker 0: and she's like he's me and you and my dad and Gordon and everyone.

444
00:30:34,521 --> 00:30:49,820
Speaker 1: I thought it was really cool how they did that the how she starts naming all the names of Who V really was and she keeps naming everyone and then finally she says herself and then she says you And then as that's happening keeps cutting to that crowd of people all wearing V masks and they all start taking their masks off.

445
00:30:50,182 --> 00:30:50,988
Speaker 1: Yep, it was just.

446
00:30:51,069 --> 00:30:52,540
Speaker 1: it was a good piece of cinematography there.

447
00:30:53,021 --> 00:31:03,257
Speaker 0: it seemed like the movie definitely took a lot of the scenes from the book not all of them, but enough of them and Truthfully acted them out you know very very accurately.

448
00:31:03,277 --> 00:31:18,789
Speaker 0: and The transitions between them and a few of the details were changed and a lot of the things that were represented by comic book imagery or comic book narration were done differently like just there instead of showing the pictures of the different Faces, which would have taken like a whole minute.

449
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:21,320
Speaker 0: They just have her say who you know all these different names.

450
00:31:21,341 --> 00:31:22,419
Speaker 0: It's the same thing Yep.

451
00:31:22,861 --> 00:31:29,020
Speaker 1: And just little things like the detective in the first one shoots V and V actually dies in a different way in the movie.

452
00:31:29,121 --> 00:31:32,260
Speaker 1: Obviously since you you know, you've seen it all of you, I hope.

453
00:31:33,164 --> 00:31:35,052
Speaker 1: But despite that the end is that I mean the.

454
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:36,700
Speaker 1: the idea of the end is the same.

455
00:31:37,182 --> 00:31:43,908
Speaker 1: It just happens in a slightly different way because the way it happens in the comic would have taken another half hour of screen time To put to draw out.

456
00:31:44,069 --> 00:31:46,642
Speaker 0: well for the way things happen in the comic this is the.

457
00:31:46,762 --> 00:31:55,420
Speaker 0: this is if all the things that are missing the only one the one that I'm most upset about is There's a guy named almond and he dies right away in the comic.

458
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:07,218
Speaker 0: But his wife is like a very important character in the comic like she is there like from the beginning doing stuff Right up to the end and then in the comic she kills the head head leader guy.

459
00:32:07,459 --> 00:32:26,140
Speaker 1: now I'm glad they took it out because in a movie a movie is a very different type of media from a comic in the sense that it's more distilled it's shorter and Having that in there because it basically you would have had to had this extra character in whereas this whole extra plot from beginning To end of the entire movie and it just would have complicated the movie and made it longer

460
00:32:26,943 --> 00:32:29,535
Speaker 0: I think I just think that it was really important.

461
00:32:29,716 --> 00:32:30,580
Speaker 1: I don't think it was at all.

462
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,086
Speaker 1: It's not important at all to the message.

463
00:32:32,227 --> 00:32:32,528
Speaker 1: It's just.

464
00:32:32,729 --> 00:32:35,620
Speaker 0: it's not important to the message, but it's important to what?

465
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,519
Speaker 0: There's a whole separate message that has to do with her.

466
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,714
Speaker 0: It's like her message which is separate from the message of the whole.

467
00:32:40,754 --> 00:32:42,019
Speaker 0: the main story was lost.

468
00:32:42,669 --> 00:32:43,340
Speaker 1: Yeah, and you know what?

469
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:47,959
Speaker 1: I think that's good because the more if you put too much into a movie it just dilutes everything and ruins it.

470
00:32:48,521 --> 00:32:56,234
Speaker 1: one of the one of the best signs of a good filmmaker at least in my opinion is someone who can distill a movie down to Where every you get everything.

471
00:32:56,375 --> 00:32:57,059
Speaker 1: everything's there.

472
00:32:57,441 --> 00:33:00,812
Speaker 1: You're never distracted by other plots that aren't meaningful.

473
00:33:01,073 --> 00:33:03,020
Speaker 1: you drive the movie toward an end and you end it.

474
00:33:03,342 --> 00:33:05,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, but then this movie could have been made in five minutes.

475
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:11,307
Speaker 0: I mean if you want to distill it, you know to the max not to the max But there's definitely a level of distillation.

476
00:33:11,790 --> 00:33:16,055
Speaker 1: and if they'd put everything that was in the comic in the movie No, you can't put everything in.

477
00:33:16,075 --> 00:33:16,660
Speaker 0: that's just silly.

478
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:23,640
Speaker 1: Well, even that plot adding that plot would have added at least a half hour or not If not more to the movie, that's actually I wouldn't mind it extra half hour.

479
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:25,672
Speaker 0: The movie was kind of short I didn't.

480
00:33:25,692 --> 00:33:26,678
Speaker 1: the movie was actually pretty long.

481
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:34,260
Speaker 1: It would have complicated the plot unnecessarily because I doesn't add anything to the plot or story it's just an extra side thing.

482
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:36,135
Speaker 0: No, I think it definitely adds a lot.

483
00:33:36,155 --> 00:33:36,659
Speaker 1: What does it add?

484
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:37,752
Speaker 1: well

485
00:33:38,648 --> 00:33:56,660
Speaker 0: it the Almonds wife sort of shows you how you don't see in the movie Like what the normal people's lives are like and like the terrible things that you know, it's like, okay You see that in general life there is kind of terrible, but you don't actually sort of know what the other people are doing.

486
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:06,633
Speaker 0: She's like the person who's you know, who is a normal person living in this terrible society and all the terrible things She has to go through because of you know, the way that things are going.

487
00:34:07,116 --> 00:34:10,569
Speaker 1: and then you see I think that just wasn't necessary for the movie.

488
00:34:10,931 --> 00:34:13,380
Speaker 0: and then you can see as her attitude is changing you.

489
00:34:13,541 --> 00:34:17,040
Speaker 0: That's the attitude of all the people like when she you know gets pissed at the government.

490
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,106
Speaker 0: That's when the people are see.

491
00:34:18,186 --> 00:34:20,639
Speaker 1: I think the movie does it in a very good simple way.

492
00:34:20,659 --> 00:34:34,327
Speaker 1: Instead of having all that extra plot and characters and scenes they just kept cutting to normal families all around Britain sitting in their houses watching TV and watching the news and showing them reacting to the news and it kept.

493
00:34:34,407 --> 00:34:43,788
Speaker 1: there's this bar that they keep cutting to as well and it keeps showing all the common people and How they're they're mumbling and their reactions and what they're saying Just changes every time.

494
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,980
Speaker 1: it cuts to them as things have happened in the movie.

495
00:34:46,301 --> 00:34:48,208
Speaker 1: These characters are have a different attitude.

496
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:57,819
Speaker 1: and then the final scene when the final you know The revolution is happening and it cuts the camera very specifically cuts again to all these places and all of those places are empty.

497
00:34:57,859 --> 00:34:59,750
Speaker 1: now It cuts to the bar and it's empty.

498
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:01,240
Speaker 1: cuts to the old folks home and it's empty.

499
00:35:01,604 --> 00:35:02,840
Speaker 1: It cuts to every one of those houses.

500
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:12,318
Speaker 1: It kept showing and they're all empty because and then at the very end you see all those faces from all those places In the line when they take off their v-masks at the end.

501
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:17,900
Speaker 1: I think that serves the same purpose as that woman only much more screen ready.

502
00:35:18,727 --> 00:35:31,747
Speaker 0: It does serve the same purpose but I think the reason that I enjoyed the the woman doing that better than the all the families is it seemed like Watching that woman's life was a lot more darker and it kept the the.

503
00:35:31,807 --> 00:35:39,947
Speaker 0: the theme of the comic seemed to be like dark and Underground like the Sun was never out and shining, you know And a lot of those people's houses like.

504
00:35:39,987 --> 00:35:48,640
Speaker 0: we're all bright and happy and it didn't really feel terrible It's you know, it felt like those people had fine lives, you know, why were they upset with the government?

505
00:35:48,881 --> 00:35:49,162
Speaker 0: You know.

506
00:35:49,523 --> 00:35:52,735
Speaker 0: and it seemed like this woman actually had a reason to be upset with the government.

507
00:35:52,856 --> 00:35:55,809
Speaker 1: and see I just think from a Filmmaking perspective life was terrible.

508
00:35:55,849 --> 00:35:57,939
Speaker 0: These people were just people watching TV.

509
00:35:58,321 --> 00:36:01,739
Speaker 1: Yeah, well you also complained about the fact that they took the whole fake computer thing out of the movie.

510
00:36:02,042 --> 00:36:08,640
Speaker 0: It's not the fake computer itself It's the the the message of V love justice.

511
00:36:09,001 --> 00:36:12,335
Speaker 0: But the leader guy took justice away and justice of sleeping with him.

512
00:36:12,536 --> 00:36:14,604
Speaker 1: metaphorically speaking Yeah, and what again?

513
00:36:14,865 --> 00:36:15,387
Speaker 0: and the compute.

514
00:36:15,427 --> 00:36:18,980
Speaker 0: the leader guy was in love with the computer and V took that away from him.

515
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:19,503
Speaker 1: And you know what?

516
00:36:19,523 --> 00:36:22,720
Speaker 1: That's just another side plot that would have just complicated the movie.

517
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,911
Speaker 1: It would have made the movie less of a movie.

518
00:36:24,931 --> 00:36:26,820
Speaker 1: It would have made it longer and more complicated.

519
00:36:27,761 --> 00:36:33,280
Speaker 0: You know when I you don't have to add everything in but there you know ways clever ways to do things.

520
00:36:33,427 --> 00:36:44,560
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah and I think the way they dealt with not having the woman in was very clever and I think I just think it's my opinion that Having the woman and her plot in the movie would have made the movie overall complicated longer and just overall worse.

521
00:36:45,168 --> 00:36:53,719
Speaker 0: See, you know it's just that the Lord of the Rings took a book and they made it into a movie and they didn't include everything and they Did compress a lot and change quite a bit?

522
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:59,420
Speaker 0: But I didn't feel like anything was missing and it was quite long and a million people went to see it.

523
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:00,369
Speaker 1: Here's the thing they did.

524
00:37:00,409 --> 00:37:03,029
Speaker 0: it in such a clever way Like this was good.

525
00:37:03,049 --> 00:37:03,914
Speaker 0: V for that.

526
00:37:03,934 --> 00:37:04,960
Speaker 0: it did the same thing.

527
00:37:05,622 --> 00:37:10,000
Speaker 0: It's just almost as good and it's just because it isn't as good as something someone else has done.

528
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:12,067
Speaker 0: I feel like you could have done it better.

529
00:37:12,087 --> 00:37:18,074
Speaker 1: the thing you feel that way and I disagree because I read V for vendetta Literally 10 minutes before I went to see the movie.

530
00:37:18,114 --> 00:37:19,039
Speaker 0: I read it like a couple days.

531
00:37:19,262 --> 00:37:27,200
Speaker 1: I understand I read it I went immediately to the movie and Despite the fact that you know the woman subplot and the fate subplot were in my mind directly.

532
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:28,700
Speaker 1: I didn't miss them at all.

533
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:32,779
Speaker 1: In fact, I was glad the fate plot was not in the movie at all because I didn't like it.

534
00:37:33,521 --> 00:37:36,820
Speaker 1: And I was glad that the woman plot wasn't in because it just would have complicated the movie.

535
00:37:37,122 --> 00:37:38,589
Speaker 1: I didn't feel like I was missing anything.

536
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:40,720
Speaker 1: And in fact, I would have been disappointed if they had appeared.

537
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:46,580
Speaker 0: Yeah, I felt like they were missing and I felt like they could have been added without making it that much longer or more complicated.

538
00:37:46,782 --> 00:37:47,977
Speaker 1: I don't think they could have at all.

539
00:37:48,582 --> 00:37:54,240
Speaker 1: I'd like to ask someone who has experience in film what they have to say about that But I don't think it would have could have been done reasonably.

540
00:37:55,101 --> 00:38:05,571
Speaker 0: The real the real reason I've said about the woman missing is, you know, not so much, you know, okay Yeah, her purpose was still served by something else in the movie But the you know the tone of it wasn't dark.

541
00:38:05,973 --> 00:38:07,499
Speaker 1: I think the tone of the movie was very dark.

542
00:38:08,143 --> 00:38:10,700
Speaker 0: No, the movie the book definitely felt a lot darker there.

543
00:38:10,901 --> 00:38:12,788
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't think I mean one.

544
00:38:12,829 --> 00:38:13,933
Speaker 1: you said the Sun was never out.

545
00:38:13,953 --> 00:38:15,620
Speaker 1: The Sun's never out in the movie either.

546
00:38:16,082 --> 00:38:16,946
Speaker 1: It's always night.

547
00:38:16,967 --> 00:38:17,952
Speaker 1: It's always dark.

548
00:38:18,012 --> 00:38:21,989
Speaker 1: Everything's always dark the bat There's almost no background in most of the scenes.

549
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:24,377
Speaker 0: no, but I'm talking about in those people's houses.

550
00:38:24,418 --> 00:38:25,669
Speaker 0: that was the time It was light.

551
00:38:26,156 --> 00:38:35,311
Speaker 1: All right I point out that that might just be a side effect of the fact that the art in the comic is very very Simple and very colorless.

552
00:38:36,075 --> 00:38:36,397
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah.

553
00:38:36,638 --> 00:38:40,079
Speaker 1: I mean look here I'm looking to see right now where it's bright and sunny and the detective sitting on the beach.

554
00:38:40,601 --> 00:38:42,831
Speaker 0: That's cuz he's far away from everything that's going on.

555
00:38:43,232 --> 00:38:45,120
Speaker 1: Yeah, I just I don't think that's an issue.

556
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,730
Speaker 1: I don't think your concern really matters.

557
00:38:47,750 --> 00:38:48,312
Speaker 0: I don't know.

558
00:38:48,352 --> 00:38:54,140
Speaker 0: It's just that when it went to those people's houses I understood the purpose of going to those people's houses and seeing what they were doing.

559
00:38:54,704 --> 00:39:00,288
Speaker 0: But it felt when it went there It felt a little weird because you know It was like these happy.

560
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:02,900
Speaker 0: it seemed like they were just like happy American homes.

561
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:05,679
Speaker 1: See to me it seemed like they were just completely ignorant of what was going on.

562
00:39:06,144 --> 00:39:07,580
Speaker 0: Oh, I didn't feel like these people were ignorant.

563
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,838
Speaker 0: They seemed to be paying it like even that little girl seemed to understand what was going on.

564
00:39:12,621 --> 00:39:18,213
Speaker 0: No right away the first time they went to her house She would like went over to the TV and was like, you know bollocks.

565
00:39:18,273 --> 00:39:20,060
Speaker 1: No, that wasn't the first time pretty sure.

566
00:39:20,261 --> 00:39:23,220
Speaker 1: No, I remember very specifically the first time they show all these people.

567
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:38,300
Speaker 1: they're just complacently watching the television not saying a word and then it's not until Things start happening and the government starts covering up more and more and it becomes more and more obvious that the government's lying That people start reacting and every time they cut back to them.

568
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,409
Speaker 1: They're reacting more and more as they realize what's called.

569
00:39:40,429 --> 00:39:43,140
Speaker 0: they do react more and more, but they're reacting right from the start.

570
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,667
Speaker 0: I mean where you would expect.

571
00:39:44,707 --> 00:39:46,134
Speaker 1: again, I point out it's a movie.

572
00:39:46,234 --> 00:39:46,696
Speaker 1: It's short.

573
00:39:46,736 --> 00:39:50,550
Speaker 0: It's a different media I know but it doesn't have to be that short.

574
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:51,974
Speaker 0: You can still have more things.

575
00:39:52,095 --> 00:39:53,720
Speaker 1: I don't like this even longer.

576
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:56,640
Speaker 1: I just don't think having those extra plots would have helped the movie at all.

577
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:59,636
Speaker 1: I think they would have just heard it if the movie wasn't perfect.

578
00:39:59,656 --> 00:40:00,399
Speaker 0: There are ways to help it.

579
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:05,800
Speaker 0: That's so I'm not saying the movie was you know, it didn't detract from the movie to the point where it was terrible.

580
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:10,920
Speaker 0: This is still you know, pretty good, but it is just like the potential was lost that was there.

581
00:40:11,523 --> 00:40:14,060
Speaker 0: I disagree that they're saying the movie was absolutely flawless.

582
00:40:14,161 --> 00:40:17,780
Speaker 1: No, I was saying that the points you make about how to make the movie better are wrong.

583
00:40:18,021 --> 00:40:18,806
Speaker 1: I don't think that.

584
00:40:18,947 --> 00:40:21,039
Speaker 1: I think that if we did what you wanted the movie would be worse.

585
00:40:21,623 --> 00:40:23,717
Speaker 0: See it, but I'm not saying specifically what to do.

586
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:24,020
Speaker 0: I'm yeah.

587
00:40:24,120 --> 00:40:28,140
Speaker 1: I think the way to do it in the woman's plot in at all would have made the movie worse no matter how you did It.

588
00:40:28,522 --> 00:40:30,070
Speaker 1: no, I think it's no matter how you did it.

589
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:33,524
Speaker 1: It would have taken a decent amount of screen time So there.

590
00:40:33,564 --> 00:40:36,396
Speaker 0: so you're saying adding any amount of screen time at all would have made the movie worse.

591
00:40:36,496 --> 00:40:38,790
Speaker 1: in the case of this movie Yeah, I think it would have disrupted the flow.

592
00:40:38,831 --> 00:40:45,898
Speaker 1: the movie flowed very well because remember the movie takes place over the course of a year from Guy Fawkes day one year until Guy Fawkes day the next year.

593
00:40:45,918 --> 00:40:51,455
Speaker 1: and Yet the movie steadily progresses through this entire year and it works.

594
00:40:51,816 --> 00:41:01,160
Speaker 1: I think adding more Action and more motive force and more characters interacting with each other in other settings within the movie Would have made it much harder to keep that continuity and keep that flow.

595
00:41:01,621 --> 00:41:02,785
Speaker 0: Well, actually that's another thing.

596
00:41:02,825 --> 00:41:04,791
Speaker 0: I just remembered the movie.

597
00:41:04,871 --> 00:41:07,820
Speaker 0: It seemed like right up front towards the beginning.

598
00:41:08,021 --> 00:41:10,418
Speaker 0: It's like the flow is sort of going day by day.

599
00:41:11,062 --> 00:41:14,199
Speaker 0: It's like the first Guy Fawkes day then November the 6th, November the 7th.

600
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:17,560
Speaker 0: It seems like it's going this day the next day the next day the next day.

601
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:22,019
Speaker 0: I mean, there's some points in the movie or you could say, okay This might be next week, you know.

602
00:41:22,564 --> 00:41:28,459
Speaker 0: and then it reaches a point and then it's sort of Fast forwards like months and months and months and months and months like all at once.

603
00:41:29,042 --> 00:41:30,551
Speaker 1: See I never really got that impression.

604
00:41:30,691 --> 00:41:38,620
Speaker 0: no right after she like In the movie after she gets out of the prison It seems like and then she leaves V then it seems to skip over a whole bunch of months.

605
00:41:38,942 --> 00:41:40,793
Speaker 0: He's like come back on November 5th and then whoop.

606
00:41:41,115 --> 00:41:41,377
Speaker 0: Okay.

607
00:41:41,397 --> 00:41:49,120
Speaker 1: All right Yeah Now while time in terms of the mechanics of time went by in terms of the plot I didn't feel as though I missed anything.

608
00:41:49,241 --> 00:41:51,212
Speaker 1: I felt as though it was progressing at the rate it should have.

609
00:41:51,615 --> 00:41:52,480
Speaker 1: I didn't feel gypped.

610
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:53,770
Speaker 1: I didn't feel like anything was missing.

611
00:41:53,790 --> 00:41:55,039
Speaker 1: I didn't feel like anything was rushed.

612
00:41:55,602 --> 00:41:59,520
Speaker 1: It just seemed like a natural flow and I think by having those other plots that flow would have been disrupted.

613
00:42:00,208 --> 00:42:00,681
Speaker 0: See, yeah It's just.

614
00:42:00,841 --> 00:42:08,209
Speaker 0: I think the flow could have been more like instead of a whole bunch of events that happened at the beginning of the Year in rapid succession skipping over a bunch.

615
00:42:08,289 --> 00:42:14,420
Speaker 0: It could have been evenly paced like, you know month You say that but yet I didn't notice that at all.

616
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:15,385
Speaker 1: And I don't know if that's.

617
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,960
Speaker 1: even if that even happens that might just be the way you perceived it.

618
00:42:18,881 --> 00:42:19,183
Speaker 0: Okay.

619
00:42:19,223 --> 00:42:22,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, I don't even know if that because there are a lot of they don't even let you know What day it is a lot of the time?

620
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,042
Speaker 1: Yeah, you know what that's fine That means.

621
00:42:24,062 --> 00:42:27,080
Speaker 1: that's why that makes the flow move so much so smoothly.

622
00:42:27,241 --> 00:42:28,932
Speaker 0: But that's the way that I perceived.

623
00:42:28,973 --> 00:42:32,945
Speaker 0: It was a whole bunch of events That was skipped over.

624
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:35,755
Speaker 1: you should have heard how much Scott bitched about this movie.

625
00:42:35,835 --> 00:42:38,486
Speaker 0: I wasn't bitching about it I was just I had.

626
00:42:38,908 --> 00:42:46,120
Speaker 0: I have this thing where it's not that the movie's bad But it's like because I know so much and because I keep thinking about other things.

627
00:42:46,220 --> 00:43:05,830
Speaker 0: It's hard to you know, when you watch a movie sometimes and like get into the groove, you know like you feel like you're in the movie or like, you know, everything around your eyeballs goes away and you're like Aha or like when you're watching Star Wars and it's like, you know, it's like time for the like, you know Awesome lightsaber fight and you're just like yeah, and you forget about everything else in the world and you're into it.

628
00:43:06,031 --> 00:43:07,820
Speaker 1: Yeah, see that happens to me every movie I watch.

629
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:09,590
Speaker 0: see that doesn't happen to me every movie.

630
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:10,474
Speaker 1: Well, that's your problem.

631
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:14,470
Speaker 0: is when I think about it so much then, you know, I can't get into the groove.

632
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:15,374
Speaker 0: It just keeps me out.

633
00:43:15,655 --> 00:43:19,270
Speaker 0: and if a movie is terrible, even if I'm not thinking about anything, I can't get into it.

634
00:43:19,551 --> 00:43:20,356
Speaker 0: You know, it's like.

635
00:43:20,719 --> 00:43:22,350
Speaker 1: well, you know, I mean honestly, that's your problem.

636
00:43:22,773 --> 00:43:27,521
Speaker 1: I mean you you nitpick the movie to death on the way home And I just I really like to pick every movie.

637
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,469
Speaker 0: but some movies can't you know?

638
00:43:30,391 --> 00:43:30,593
Speaker 0: Hmm.

639
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:34,033
Speaker 0: I mean there are movies that are much less there.

640
00:43:34,094 --> 00:43:37,818
Speaker 0: I mean there are movies that are Like worse than this one yet.

641
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:39,345
Speaker 0: I'll still get into a groove on them.

642
00:43:39,406 --> 00:43:40,683
Speaker 0: You know, I don't know what it is All right.

643
00:43:41,010 --> 00:43:41,854
Speaker 1: See your problem is just.

644
00:43:41,934 --> 00:43:46,350
Speaker 1: it seemed like when we were driving home you very much kept comparing the movie to the comic.

645
00:43:46,510 --> 00:43:50,021
Speaker 0: That's the problem and once you've read one, you can't help but compare the two.

646
00:43:50,101 --> 00:43:52,830
Speaker 1: see I can take each one individually on its own.

647
00:43:53,238 --> 00:43:53,770
Speaker 1: I take the move.

648
00:43:53,850 --> 00:43:55,863
Speaker 1: I was watching the movie and I just read the comic.

649
00:43:56,285 --> 00:44:02,890
Speaker 1: but the comic While it might have colored some of my perceptions of the movie I saw it as a completely separate entity and I took it for what it was.

650
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,268
Speaker 0: Yes, I just have a hard time.

651
00:44:05,612 --> 00:44:12,986
Speaker 0: Maybe I watched it more times and tried real hard But it's like even if I'm you know, I think try to think about it as a separate entity.

652
00:44:13,047 --> 00:44:18,589
Speaker 0: I can do so Consciously, but I can't do so, you know in a feeling good sort of way.

653
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:23,928
Speaker 0: well honestly because like you just can't help but think it's like if I tried to read Lord of the Rings.

654
00:44:23,968 --> 00:44:28,964
Speaker 0: now, right and I read the word and it says like Aragorn stabs the guy all like.

655
00:44:28,984 --> 00:44:30,470
Speaker 0: I can't help but think of that guy.

656
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:32,181
Speaker 0: He was acting as Aragorn in the movie.

657
00:44:32,201 --> 00:44:37,070
Speaker 0: There's no way I can't picture What I pictured Aragorn as when I read the book before the movie existed.

658
00:44:37,211 --> 00:44:39,790
Speaker 1: Well, I hate to say it but that's just a failing on your part in my opinion.

659
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:46,050
Speaker 0: No Anyone out there if you've ever seen a music video and you remember the music video and then you hear the song.

660
00:44:46,351 --> 00:44:48,279
Speaker 0: You cannot help but think of the music video.

661
00:44:48,299 --> 00:44:49,162
Speaker 0: There is no way.

662
00:44:49,182 --> 00:44:51,150
Speaker 0: that's why they make music videos.

663
00:44:51,391 --> 00:44:54,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, it depends unless you've forgotten the music video or something.

664
00:44:54,330 --> 00:45:01,936
Speaker 1: But I'm just saying I can take V for Vendetta the movie completely independent of you for a net of the comic Even though I've seen and read both.

665
00:45:02,558 --> 00:45:12,890
Speaker 0: I can take it independently on a you know conscious thought level Like I can think about it separately, but I can't watch it without, you know I can't watch or read one without thinking about the other.

666
00:45:13,303 --> 00:45:18,213
Speaker 1: Yeah Which to me was just annoying because we couldn't talk about the movie on the way home because you kept nitpicking it and complaining About it.

667
00:45:18,575 --> 00:45:20,124
Speaker 0: I wasn't nitpicking and complaining.

668
00:45:21,190 --> 00:45:25,006
Speaker 0: I Was just comparing and saying, you know, this wasn't in there and that was.

669
00:45:25,066 --> 00:45:26,757
Speaker 0: and this is you know Cuz that's all.

670
00:45:26,797 --> 00:45:28,350
Speaker 0: you can't help but think about those things.

671
00:45:28,510 --> 00:45:28,872
Speaker 0: They're just.

672
00:45:29,353 --> 00:45:33,950
Speaker 1: I thought about him and I ignored him because they didn't seem relevant to the idea of either the movie or the comic.

673
00:45:34,311 --> 00:45:34,612
Speaker 0: Cuz it.

674
00:45:34,813 --> 00:45:37,323
Speaker 0: the idea in the main idea was the same.

675
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:40,443
Speaker 0: well mostly the same for except for the politics The main idea was the same.

676
00:45:40,848 --> 00:45:42,816
Speaker 1: actually I think the politics idea was the same too.

677
00:45:42,856 --> 00:45:46,669
Speaker 1: the thing was the movie just went more into the politics and lessened everything else.

678
00:45:47,231 --> 00:45:53,055
Speaker 0: hmm, the politics are the same but different, you know is like The same general idea.

679
00:45:53,095 --> 00:45:57,210
Speaker 0: but the movie politics are very much more honed in and pointed.

680
00:45:57,652 --> 00:45:58,195
Speaker 1: I think that was.

681
00:45:58,316 --> 00:46:00,990
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't think that matters the ID the political ideas were the same.

682
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:04,562
Speaker 1: The only difference was the examples they made and the way they did it.

683
00:46:04,924 --> 00:46:12,347
Speaker 1: in terms of the actual political idea I think they were almost identical Mm-hmm, except I guess except for the subtraction of the anarchy bit.

684
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:14,902
Speaker 1: now I mean the anarchy bit was the problem.

685
00:46:14,922 --> 00:46:16,130
Speaker 1: You couldn't have all that in the movie.

686
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:17,544
Speaker 1: It would have just complicated it too much.

687
00:46:17,968 --> 00:46:23,810
Speaker 1: all them Like I said way back all the movie did at the end differently was that it had the punch of the end result.

688
00:46:23,890 --> 00:46:27,586
Speaker 1: You know the fascism is overthrown, but it didn't have the follow-through with.

689
00:46:27,646 --> 00:46:30,820
Speaker 1: now we have anarchy Mmm, it just it didn't follow through.

690
00:46:30,861 --> 00:46:31,805
Speaker 1: it just stopped at.

691
00:46:32,066 --> 00:46:32,910
Speaker 1: the government has fallen.

692
00:46:33,291 --> 00:46:35,922
Speaker 1: You know at the fascism was fallen, but the idea was the same.

693
00:46:35,962 --> 00:46:37,830
Speaker 1: They just didn't follow through with the secondary idea.

694
00:46:38,251 --> 00:46:41,783
Speaker 0: Yeah, well that didn't really matter so much actually, but I mean, that's the only difference I saw.

695
00:46:41,804 --> 00:46:42,245
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

696
00:46:43,630 --> 00:46:43,891
Speaker 0: I Don't know.

697
00:46:43,931 --> 00:46:47,309
Speaker 0: it seems to me like your main complaint against anything that you know.

698
00:46:47,791 --> 00:46:52,210
Speaker 0: My complaints were all like it wasn't complicated enough and yours were it would have made it too complicated.

699
00:46:52,572 --> 00:46:54,343
Speaker 0: Yet you're always the person who's like.

700
00:46:54,363 --> 00:46:55,470
Speaker 0: I like complex things.

701
00:46:55,731 --> 00:47:09,130
Speaker 1: yeah, I like complex things, but you know what movies are a specific type of media and a Good movie is not overly Complicated because then it's not fun to watch or it's not useful to watch or it's not enjoyable or the flow is wrong.

702
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:10,748
Speaker 0: That is true.

703
00:47:11,492 --> 00:47:29,947
Speaker 0: However, you know the only point I'm making is that if you're going to you know just make a new movie that happens to have the same characters and setting as some other media because you didn't you know like a comic or a video game or something and You're not actually going to try to do the exact same thing.

704
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:30,650
Speaker 1: I think they did.

705
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:32,279
Speaker 1: I think they did almost the exact same thing.

706
00:47:32,299 --> 00:47:34,090
Speaker 0: No, I don't think they did the exact same thing.

707
00:47:34,331 --> 00:47:36,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think they did just as well as Lord of the Rings did.

708
00:47:36,741 --> 00:47:37,806
Speaker 0: no not even close.

709
00:47:37,906 --> 00:47:38,589
Speaker 1: I'd say so.

710
00:47:39,653 --> 00:47:40,697
Speaker 1: I would definitely say so.

711
00:47:40,737 --> 00:47:43,326
Speaker 0: no cuz Lord of the Rings is on like my a-list of movies.

712
00:47:43,366 --> 00:47:45,415
Speaker 0: This is like oh, yeah I a-list of movies.

713
00:47:45,576 --> 00:47:48,050
Speaker 1: how good a movie is or how good something has nothing to do with it.

714
00:47:48,281 --> 00:47:55,534
Speaker 0: No Because the comic if it like if you trans somehow magically translated the comic into like a perfect movie somehow By magic, right?

715
00:47:55,754 --> 00:47:57,783
Speaker 0: All right, and that would be on my a-list of movies.

716
00:47:57,803 --> 00:47:58,867
Speaker 0: Well, I'd even like a question.

717
00:47:59,088 --> 00:48:02,081
Speaker 1: see for me It's like I mean this is animated a - I can talk about.

718
00:48:02,101 --> 00:48:05,477
Speaker 1: All right, you've got the Count of Monte Cristo the book And you've got gone cuts.

719
00:48:05,659 --> 00:48:07,248
Speaker 1: Whoa, the the animation.

720
00:48:07,530 --> 00:48:11,867
Speaker 1: now I've seen many of the Count of Monte Cristo movies over the years and in my opinion, they're all terrible.

721
00:48:12,329 --> 00:48:16,465
Speaker 1: now The book is long and specific and exacting and detailed.

722
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:20,030
Speaker 1: now gone cuts Oh the anime representation of the Count of Monte Cristo.

723
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:27,150
Speaker 1: It varies and diverges wildly from the book in terms of the actual plot, especially towards the end.

724
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,230
Speaker 1: It just goes off and everything's different.

725
00:48:29,551 --> 00:48:42,447
Speaker 1: but the ideas between the two and the end to set it in the theme and Just the ideology are identical and as far as I'm concerned gone cuts Oh is probably the best film representation of the Count of Monte Cristo I've ever seen and I haven't seen

726
00:48:42,769 --> 00:48:43,110
Speaker 0: all of it.

727
00:48:43,191 --> 00:48:44,505
Speaker 0: So, I don't know if you can actually say that.

728
00:48:44,525 --> 00:48:50,170
Speaker 1: but anyway Well, I've seen the end and I've seen the first like eight and I've got a good idea of what happens in the middle.

729
00:48:50,271 --> 00:48:53,110
Speaker 1: I've read spoilers and it follows the same idea.

730
00:48:53,291 --> 00:48:58,550
Speaker 1: It just does it differently and I think that that's what matters a lot more than following what actually happens point for point.

731
00:48:59,032 --> 00:49:01,890
Speaker 0: See, I don't watch things to to know what the idea is.

732
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:06,290
Speaker 0: I mean if someone tells me what their idea is, it's like yeah, I've heard every idea there there is to hear.

733
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:07,408
Speaker 0: You're not telling me anything new.

734
00:49:07,891 --> 00:49:14,150
Speaker 0: The reason I watch or read something is to discover the idea the act of discovering and reading and finding things out.

735
00:49:14,190 --> 00:49:16,450
Speaker 1: So if that's the case, why did you watch the movie V for Vendetta?

736
00:49:16,550 --> 00:49:18,096
Speaker 1: Because you already knew what the idea was.

737
00:49:18,136 --> 00:49:21,690
Speaker 1: you weren't gonna learn anything new by watching it because it's a cool movie.

738
00:49:22,159 --> 00:49:22,384
Speaker 0: So,

739
00:49:22,404 --> 00:49:34,030
Speaker 1: alright but other than that then you you'll admit that you had no reason to watch it that you wouldn't have gotten anything out it because You already know the idea and there's no way The movie could have been good for you because you already know the idea unless it presented a new idea.

740
00:49:34,413 --> 00:49:36,389
Speaker 1: But then you would have been mad because it didn't follow the book.

741
00:49:37,091 --> 00:49:49,615
Speaker 0: Because it doesn't matter if I know what the idea is already It's that when you go and you you know They put up symbolisms in front of you and analogies and then you figure them out and even if you already know what the result is it's the Figuring out of them.

742
00:49:49,655 --> 00:49:51,181
Speaker 0: That is the fun part for you.

743
00:49:51,201 --> 00:49:53,250
Speaker 1: I very much disagree.

744
00:49:53,895 --> 00:50:02,829
Speaker 0: I know it's like if I know you know The result is for and then someone puts a math puzzle in front of me I still go through figuring it out and then I get to four at the end and I'm like, aha

745
00:50:03,651 --> 00:50:04,355
Speaker 1: Alright, so but

746
00:50:04,395 --> 00:50:05,704
Speaker 0: if it's too it's it's sort of like.

747
00:50:05,744 --> 00:50:07,312
Speaker 0: if it's too easy It's like.

748
00:50:07,352 --> 00:50:09,741
Speaker 1: so your complaint is that the movie was too easy to figure out.

749
00:50:10,102 --> 00:50:12,330
Speaker 1: kind of Wow, that's I hate to say it.

750
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:15,865
Speaker 1: I don't want to sound rude, but that's a really fanboy kind of thinking in my eyes.

751
00:50:16,046 --> 00:50:16,790
Speaker 0: It's not really.

752
00:50:17,050 --> 00:50:18,916
Speaker 0: See, that's the thing about fanboy not fanboy.

753
00:50:18,936 --> 00:50:20,040
Speaker 1: I'd say comic book nerd.

754
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:21,063
Speaker 0: No, it's not cuz.

755
00:50:21,564 --> 00:50:33,279
Speaker 0: nowadays anyone who says ooh The the comic did not exactly match the movie in every single panel and the dialogue was off by one word Oh my god, that's a fanboy.

756
00:50:33,319 --> 00:50:36,774
Speaker 0: But now it seems like anyone who says, you know Oh, it wasn't.

757
00:50:36,995 --> 00:50:40,330
Speaker 0: you know, the the exact same thing is now labeled as a fanboy.

758
00:50:40,411 --> 00:50:41,400
Speaker 0: It's not that I'm not saying.

759
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:42,510
Speaker 0: it is the exact same thing.

760
00:50:42,711 --> 00:50:44,157
Speaker 0: I know that it to be the exact.

761
00:50:44,218 --> 00:50:46,970
Speaker 1: I'm saying that I think you're really overly critical here.

762
00:50:47,331 --> 00:50:48,376
Speaker 0: I'm not overly critical.

763
00:50:48,416 --> 00:50:50,566
Speaker 0: Look the Lord of the Rings didn't have Tom Bombadil.

764
00:50:50,746 --> 00:50:51,510
Speaker 0: who gives a shit.

765
00:50:51,650 --> 00:50:53,218
Speaker 0: Yeah, that has nothing to do with it.

766
00:50:53,238 --> 00:50:58,342
Speaker 1: because while Tom Bombadil was great and important for the book Yeah, I think putting him in the movie would have just complicated thing.

767
00:50:58,362 --> 00:50:58,764
Speaker 1: cuz made it.

768
00:50:58,804 --> 00:51:02,558
Speaker 0: Tom Bombadil is like this You know crazy kind of fairy guy.

769
00:51:02,578 --> 00:51:05,910
Speaker 0: He doesn't fit with the movie, you know, here's see might is that Tom Bombadil?

770
00:51:06,111 --> 00:51:09,130
Speaker 1: Is the same as the fake computer in that it was unnecessary?

771
00:51:10,050 --> 00:51:13,263
Speaker 0: No, cuz I can feel how Tom Bombadil just doesn't fit in with.

772
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:15,110
Speaker 0: you know, what the movies are doing at all.

773
00:51:15,190 --> 00:51:19,190
Speaker 1: But yeah, and you know what the fake computer definitely feels like it fits in not at all.

774
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:20,657
Speaker 0: There's a totally different feeling.

775
00:51:20,898 --> 00:51:21,401
Speaker 1: not to me.

776
00:51:21,541 --> 00:51:24,820
Speaker 1: to me the fake computer is completely unnecessary I don't know.

777
00:51:24,840 --> 00:51:26,089
Speaker 0: I get a different feeling from it.

778
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:30,130
Speaker 1: All right to me the fake computer is this extraneous thing that didn't even need to be in the comic.

779
00:51:30,811 --> 00:51:32,641
Speaker 0: No, I felt that the fake computer.

780
00:51:32,661 --> 00:51:34,310
Speaker 0: I was constantly thinking about it in the comic.

781
00:51:34,873 --> 00:51:39,336
Speaker 1: Every time I saw the fake computer stuff after I realized what was going on with it I basically just ignored it.

782
00:51:39,396 --> 00:51:40,019
Speaker 1: It just wasn't.

783
00:51:40,481 --> 00:51:42,270
Speaker 1: it didn't seem to fit with everything else in the book.

784
00:51:42,673 --> 00:51:42,976
Speaker 0: I don't know.

785
00:51:42,996 --> 00:51:44,449
Speaker 0: when I read the comic it was like.

786
00:51:44,655 --> 00:51:48,662
Speaker 0: You know I was just once you knew that there was this fake computer running everything.

787
00:51:48,963 --> 00:51:52,679
Speaker 0: you would start to see what it was running all over The place you'd be like, oh there it is.

788
00:51:52,699 --> 00:51:54,650
Speaker 0: Oh, that's the fake computer, too.

789
00:51:54,751 --> 00:51:54,812
Speaker 0: I

790
00:51:54,833 --> 00:52:01,727
Speaker 1: mean so once again It's you you want to have a movie or a book where you have to figure all these things out and I just want to get The idea from it and the treatment of the idea

791
00:52:03,464 --> 00:52:05,056
Speaker 0: mmm, maybe Well,

792
00:52:05,076 --> 00:52:06,090
Speaker 1: yeah, cuz I know what I want.

793
00:52:06,351 --> 00:52:06,431
Speaker 1: I'm.

794
00:52:06,552 --> 00:52:12,134
Speaker 1: I know very much what I want out of movies and comics and V for Vendetta the movie very much gave me what I Wanted, you

795
00:52:12,154 --> 00:52:20,801
Speaker 0: know, it's just that I've seen you know, so many things and and I guess my sense is sort of dull It's like I just need intellectual exercise is what I'm looking for.

796
00:52:20,881 --> 00:52:23,350
Speaker 1: And if I don't well then why watch blockbuster movies?

797
00:52:24,192 --> 00:52:30,278
Speaker 0: Because I also enjoy blatant complete pulp Non-intellectual fighting and knife-throwing action.

798
00:52:30,298 --> 00:52:30,920
Speaker 0: That's awesome.

799
00:52:31,221 --> 00:52:33,828
Speaker 0: All right and explosions great cuz.

800
00:52:33,868 --> 00:52:38,977
Speaker 0: I'm a man Uh-huh, and you know Biologies and such.

801
00:52:39,499 --> 00:52:42,250
Speaker 1: so somehow biologies are linked to explosions.

802
00:52:42,972 --> 00:52:44,999
Speaker 0: Hey, I like the the Predators.

803
00:52:45,059 --> 00:52:48,350
Speaker 1: and see I never really liked any of the predator movies.

804
00:52:48,430 --> 00:52:51,885
Speaker 0: I've only seen one the the one first ones the only one you want to see.

805
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:52,748
Speaker 1: I didn't really like it.

806
00:52:53,332 --> 00:52:55,870
Speaker 1: No, I love the predator and we were talking about Rambo earlier.

807
00:52:55,930 --> 00:52:56,974
Speaker 1: I thought Rambo was dumb.

808
00:52:57,034 --> 00:52:59,863
Speaker 0: Rambo one is also it seems like the number ones of all.

809
00:52:59,903 --> 00:53:00,505
Speaker 0: those are okay.

810
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:01,990
Speaker 0: predator one Rambo one.

811
00:53:02,393 --> 00:53:04,990
Speaker 0: Well, actually terminator one and two not three.

812
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:10,515
Speaker 1: Well, most of our generation saw terminator two before we saw terminator one, but that's a whole other issue Not me.

813
00:53:10,918 --> 00:53:12,509
Speaker 1: most people I've spoken to saw two first.

814
00:53:12,791 --> 00:53:15,103
Speaker 0: Well, that's because two made it a lot bigger in the theaters and thing.

815
00:53:15,123 --> 00:53:16,229
Speaker 1: Yep, and then everyone saw two.

816
00:53:16,531 --> 00:53:18,145
Speaker 1: Wait a minute, and they went back and found one.

817
00:53:18,367 --> 00:53:22,910
Speaker 0: Yep It doesn't matter cuz those movies aren't you don't really need to see both of them in any particular order.

818
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:25,461
Speaker 1: But anyway, we've gone long case in point.

819
00:53:25,903 --> 00:53:27,530
Speaker 1: I thought you friend that it was fantastic.

820
00:53:28,213 --> 00:53:32,050
Speaker 1: If you're now, I don't think any many people listen to our show who are this way.

821
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:37,621
Speaker 1: but if you were a right-winger or a right-wing Republican or Very conservative in any way.

822
00:53:37,761 --> 00:53:39,150
Speaker 1: I don't think you're gonna like view for vendetta.

823
00:53:39,362 --> 00:53:44,470
Speaker 0: No Wait, if you're a real conservative like Abraham Lincoln, you will love this movie.

824
00:53:44,972 --> 00:53:48,309
Speaker 0: If you are a George Bushite, you will hate this movie so much.

825
00:53:49,491 --> 00:53:53,265
Speaker 1: Actually, I wish you hadn't used Abraham Lincoln as an example, oh, yeah, that's true.

826
00:53:53,406 --> 00:53:55,896
Speaker 0: Abraham Lincoln My me think of someone better.

827
00:53:55,917 --> 00:53:58,509
Speaker 0: Hold on cuz I forgot about his heaviest corpus BS.

828
00:53:58,931 --> 00:54:00,175
Speaker 1: Yeah, I don't get into it.

829
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:04,710
Speaker 1: But Abraham Lincoln is not a. I'm not pleased with Abraham Lincoln as a president.

830
00:54:04,750 --> 00:54:08,547
Speaker 0: Yeah, he's just the first name that comes to mind when I think of old and conservative together.

831
00:54:08,567 --> 00:54:15,326
Speaker 1: Yeah John Adams actually kind of as compared to Thomas Jefferson wasn't Madison a conservative.

832
00:54:15,667 --> 00:54:16,750
Speaker 1: He was a fiscal conservative.

833
00:54:16,850 --> 00:54:18,678
Speaker 1: I don't know much else about his policies me.

834
00:54:18,698 --> 00:54:20,987
Speaker 1: They're honestly after Jefferson and Adams.

835
00:54:21,047 --> 00:54:21,610
Speaker 1: I skipped a bit.

836
00:54:21,932 --> 00:54:25,435
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean all those middle guys Taft and whatnot.

837
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:27,404
Speaker 1: I know a lot about Taft, but that's it's like.

838
00:54:27,424 --> 00:54:34,882
Speaker 0: that's irrespective, you know days It's from Abraham Lincoln up through Teddy Roosevelt, no one cares what I care.

839
00:54:34,962 --> 00:54:36,710
Speaker 1: What about the reconstruction the Gilded Age?

840
00:54:37,790 --> 00:54:41,785
Speaker 0: you mean it was grant and then Alright, whatever.

841
00:54:41,805 --> 00:54:42,070
Speaker 1: We're not.

842
00:54:42,833 --> 00:54:48,860
Speaker 1: We're not gonna get into another show on funny presidents And not so funny presidents and this whole bit of presidents.

843
00:54:48,880 --> 00:54:49,843
Speaker 1: You seem to have forgotten about.

844
00:54:50,124 --> 00:54:50,385
Speaker 0: Yes.

845
00:54:50,766 --> 00:54:58,396
Speaker 0: So, uh real conservatives be at peace, but modern ones Neoconservatives, I guess perhaps.

846
00:54:58,656 --> 00:55:01,486
Speaker 1: Yeah V for Vendetta is an indictment against everything you believe.

847
00:55:01,546 --> 00:55:08,510
Speaker 0: if you are a neo conservative Well, that's because the Wachowski guys who made the matrix who wrote this screenplay are this, you know liberal kind of dude.

848
00:55:08,590 --> 00:55:12,937
Speaker 1: So well also I mean V for Vendetta if you read the comic Is very.

849
00:55:12,957 --> 00:55:23,210
Speaker 1: I mean it has all these other ideas in it but it's a very relevant bit of political writing among other things mm-hmm and The movie just takes that and applies it to the current political situation.

850
00:55:23,679 --> 00:55:25,134
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Now the pro.

851
00:55:25,154 --> 00:55:33,564
Speaker 1: the only problem with it is that anyone who would get riled up by this I think has already been riled up By things like Fahrenheit 9/11 and all these other sorts of movies that have come out lately.

852
00:55:33,644 --> 00:55:34,447
Speaker 1: a control room.

853
00:55:35,009 --> 00:55:36,513
Speaker 0: Yep You know what?

854
00:55:36,594 --> 00:55:39,570
Speaker 0: Actually, I could draw a lot of comparisons to this with Death Note.

855
00:55:40,190 --> 00:55:42,841
Speaker 1: Easily Actually, I I mentioned the.

856
00:55:42,861 --> 00:55:47,246
Speaker 1: my kind of thought is though That is one difference between V for Vendetta the movie and the comic.

857
00:55:47,286 --> 00:55:48,110
Speaker 1: is that in the movie?

858
00:55:48,710 --> 00:55:51,842
Speaker 1: They bring up the Count of Monte Cristo several times.

859
00:55:51,902 --> 00:55:53,970
Speaker 0: Yeah, they show you the coolest thing.

860
00:55:53,970 --> 00:55:55,849
Speaker 1: Well, they the original one of the original movies.

861
00:55:56,332 --> 00:56:00,350
Speaker 1: They actually shows the last scene of the Count of Monte Cristo and they show it multiple times.

862
00:56:00,791 --> 00:56:04,719
Speaker 1: So if you have you don't know how the Count of Monte Cristo ends V for Vendetta ruins it.

863
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:11,376
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm Like the part of the movie when I was just like.

864
00:56:11,396 --> 00:56:18,839
Speaker 1: ah at the end when they asks who V was and The first thing that Evie says is Edmund dance.

865
00:56:19,281 --> 00:56:21,487
Speaker 1: Yep, who is obviously the Count of Monte Cristo.

866
00:56:21,507 --> 00:56:22,892
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm Yeah.

867
00:56:23,354 --> 00:56:25,001
Speaker 1: Anyway, I said before I'll say it again.

868
00:56:25,042 --> 00:56:27,875
Speaker 1: We're wrapping up here that we've talked long enough Mm-hmm.

869
00:56:27,915 --> 00:56:32,910
Speaker 0: Thus concludes our non themed week that the Should we have a themed week next week or not?

870
00:56:33,050 --> 00:56:36,781
Speaker 1: Let's not lock it in since we're actually recording already a week in advance.

871
00:56:37,062 --> 00:56:40,795
Speaker 0: fine two weeks from now is the second theme Unless something happens.

872
00:56:41,317 --> 00:56:43,908
Speaker 1: Yeah, but two weeks from now depends on when you all listen to this.

873
00:56:44,089 --> 00:56:46,178
Speaker 1: Yeah Let's just stop before we dig ourselves deeper.

874
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:48,228
Speaker 0: I'll take the convention schedule to make sure.

875
00:56:48,248 --> 00:56:50,669
Speaker 1: yeah I will say one thing a final meta bit here.

876
00:56:51,591 --> 00:56:54,025
Speaker 1: Well, you know we say always like.

877
00:56:54,066 --> 00:56:54,790
Speaker 1: we record at night.

878
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:58,087
Speaker 1: We're a real night show even though we're recording like this current episode.

879
00:56:58,107 --> 00:57:05,202
Speaker 1: ahead of time I'll tell you all right now that it is currently 10 12 p.m Fuck it's night and we're recording.

880
00:57:05,443 --> 00:57:07,250
Speaker 1: we never ever record during the day.

881
00:57:08,251 --> 00:57:12,169
Speaker 0: Well, that's good because not a lot of V for Vendetta takes place during the day.

882
00:57:13,130 --> 00:57:20,799
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah The funniest thing on my final bit is that a friend of ours called me I hadn't seen the movie yet And I hadn't really read the comic yet like a few days ago.

883
00:57:20,859 --> 00:57:27,664
Speaker 1: She called and she says and this is funny Hey this movies out and I think it's really up your alley V for Vendetta.

884
00:57:27,684 --> 00:57:40,182
Speaker 1: It's like yeah, tell me something I haven't known about for six months, but the funniest thing she goes on to say that Yeah, V really reminded me of you, you know, if you were crazy But I'd like she that's totally what you would do and you know what?

885
00:57:40,664 --> 00:57:42,330
Speaker 1: Yeah, maybe to a point.

886
00:57:42,772 --> 00:57:46,165
Speaker 1: I don't think I'd wear a guy fox mask and run around with knives killing people.

887
00:57:46,647 --> 00:57:48,529
Speaker 0: if I was more badass I might be the detective guy.

888
00:57:49,031 --> 00:57:59,109
Speaker 1: but in terms of political philosophy and specifically in the comic the idea of anarchy as a Movement as opposed to anarchy as you know, well anarchy in the UK.

889
00:57:59,431 --> 00:58:02,624
Speaker 1: Yeah, it fairly succinctly sums up some of my political ideas.

890
00:58:02,845 --> 00:58:03,809
Speaker 0: some of them some of them.

891
00:58:04,131 --> 00:58:07,741
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean no one here is gonna say there should be no government.

892
00:58:08,544 --> 00:58:09,125
Speaker 1: It depends.

893
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:10,710
Speaker 0: There should be at least something.

894
00:58:11,171 --> 00:58:13,097
Speaker 1: Yeah, there should be something not nothing.

895
00:58:13,598 --> 00:58:14,842
