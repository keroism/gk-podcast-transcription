1
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,540
Speaker 1: It's Monday April 16th 2018 on rim.

2
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:15,567
Speaker 1: I'm just gonna and this is geek nights tonight.

3
00:00:15,788 --> 00:00:18,368
Speaker 1: We are talking about destroying data.

4
00:00:21,032 --> 00:00:22,023
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

5
00:00:24,213 --> 00:00:31,190
Speaker 1: So I had a co-worker who was in town from London this week And I got to tell him that he basically got to experience the entirety of New York spring.

6
00:00:32,052 --> 00:00:37,368
Speaker 1: okay, cuz It feels like this has only been happening in the last three years.

7
00:00:38,317 --> 00:00:39,388
Speaker 1: But I feel like every year.

8
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:46,077
Speaker 1: It's just like winter and then suddenly it's 80 degrees and then it goes like a little bit And then it's just summer.

9
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:47,990
Speaker 0: everyone talks about climate change, right?

10
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:48,774
Speaker 0: Oh, it's get the.

11
00:00:48,915 --> 00:00:51,690
Speaker 0: you know, the average temperature of the world is getting warmer, right?

12
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:52,850
Speaker 0: Well, that's not been my experience.

13
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:55,339
Speaker 0: My experience is simply that we did.

14
00:00:55,399 --> 00:00:58,510
Speaker 0: the start and end of the seasons has been shifted later, right?

15
00:00:58,751 --> 00:01:00,816
Speaker 1: It's not just that the summer star selves are.

16
00:01:00,876 --> 00:01:06,209
Speaker 0: summer starts later and it goes longer and then winter starts later and goes longer.

17
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,019
Speaker 0: So really just the season moved.

18
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:09,910
Speaker 0: they got pushed ahead in the year.

19
00:01:10,211 --> 00:01:14,210
Speaker 0: They don't line up with the months in the same way, but it's not that it is not extreme.

20
00:01:14,973 --> 00:01:23,118
Speaker 0: the changes are more extreme on a day-to-day point is is that it's cold and Even though other people say climate change is bad.

21
00:01:23,138 --> 00:01:28,149
Speaker 0: I feel like I want to burn more coal until it's you know 80-degrees every day.

22
00:01:29,531 --> 00:01:29,913
Speaker 1: He's called.

23
00:01:29,953 --> 00:01:31,339
Speaker 1: they want their stand-up routine bad.

24
00:01:31,379 --> 00:01:33,910
Speaker 0: I'm just saying I want it's cold.

25
00:01:34,733 --> 00:01:38,266
Speaker 1: I'm not happy but I can say that because I ski.

26
00:01:38,286 --> 00:01:43,050
Speaker 1: so I thought I'd like the Nuances of weather like yeah, we should burn coal until no one can ski anymore.

27
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:48,230
Speaker 0: Well actually save lives even though the the the bad weather will kill some people.

28
00:01:48,451 --> 00:01:51,861
Speaker 1: I think the bad weather already kills more people than skiing ever has key.

29
00:01:51,901 --> 00:01:54,569
Speaker 0: people will not be able to ski and will does be saved.

30
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:56,736
Speaker 1: Plus we can ski indoors.

31
00:01:57,279 --> 00:01:58,263
Speaker 1: They're skiing in Dubai.

32
00:01:58,565 --> 00:02:00,875
Speaker 0: That's safer than Skiing on a mountain?

33
00:02:01,639 --> 00:02:09,229
Speaker 1: probably not because no there's no trees and rocks and indoor skiing Yeah, but indoor skiing is pretty much only people who don't know how to ski which is the primary source of ski injuries.

34
00:02:10,014 --> 00:02:11,261
Speaker 1: People who don't know how to ski skiing.

35
00:02:11,281 --> 00:02:15,716
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, but So it got crazy hot.

36
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:18,183
Speaker 1: but oh, yes, I was getting my wasn't crazy hot.

37
00:02:18,223 --> 00:02:20,830
Speaker 0: It was slightly chilly relative slightly chilly.

38
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,438
Speaker 0: It was 79 degrees slightly chilly.

39
00:02:24,281 --> 00:02:25,766
Speaker 1: I think you've just turned into an old man.

40
00:02:25,786 --> 00:02:26,930
Speaker 1: I think you're permanently there.

41
00:02:27,551 --> 00:02:29,082
Speaker 1: You're your old man thermal when you're.

42
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:30,850
Speaker 1: what are you gonna do when you're 90?

43
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:33,710
Speaker 1: It has to be like a hundred and ten or you're freezing putting on a sweater.

44
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:37,390
Speaker 0: Well, all the people who are currently in Florida who are no good will be dead because I'm younger than them.

45
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,389
Speaker 0: So now I can move to Florida and perfectly fine.

46
00:02:39,771 --> 00:02:42,741
Speaker 0: But Florida will know all the Florida men will be dead by then.

47
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:47,465
Speaker 1: if I fly in Florida will suddenly be a good place And I fly out west or go way north.

48
00:02:47,546 --> 00:02:48,050
Speaker 1: I can just ski.

49
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,813
Speaker 1: It doesn't really matter.

50
00:02:48,893 --> 00:03:01,416
Speaker 1: but in terms of like upstate New York, Vermont, New Hampshire skiing The difference of even a couple degrees a month like a month and a half or so in either direction drastically changes everything.

51
00:03:01,436 --> 00:03:13,263
Speaker 1: and I can definitely say that the last three years have been very difficult ski seasons because we're just over that threshold for at least like Upstate New York and edging into parts of New Hampshire in Vermont.

52
00:03:13,364 --> 00:03:17,937
Speaker 0: No, I don't give a shit is good for me For now till New York floods Inflated today.

53
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,365
Speaker 0: Yeah, I was fine.

54
00:03:19,385 --> 00:03:20,009
Speaker 0: I'm on the third floor.

55
00:03:21,131 --> 00:03:27,534
Speaker 1: the funniest thing about that is that I got the alert and of course my phone doesn't make noise because I'm an adult but Pretty much.

56
00:03:27,755 --> 00:03:40,283
Speaker 1: I'm on this floor with like thousand plus other people so all morning Every like five minutes someone's phone would make that D Emergency alert sound and then you get this scattered delay as one by one.

57
00:03:40,383 --> 00:03:41,527
Speaker 1: Everyone's phone makes the noise.

58
00:03:41,547 --> 00:03:51,425
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm I think the only person on earth or just keeps their phone always in vibrate mode no matter what when there's a Another when there's a real emergency that actually warrants the use of that system.

59
00:03:51,445 --> 00:03:52,710
Speaker 0: then what's gonna happen?

60
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:58,142
Speaker 0: It'll vibrate and I'll know cuz I knew anyway I'm it on your floor of a thousand people.

61
00:03:58,424 --> 00:04:03,125
Speaker 0: It'll go D D the same thing and then everyone looks at their phone and then what?

62
00:04:03,386 --> 00:04:04,250
Speaker 1: and then they do whatever.

63
00:04:04,832 --> 00:04:08,106
Speaker 1: Whatever the thing says so far all the things said was parts of Queens.

64
00:04:08,126 --> 00:04:08,990
Speaker 1: They don't care about flooded.

65
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:12,580
Speaker 1: Stay off the stay off the highways on the edges of Manhattan.

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:15,610
Speaker 0: Yeah, what's it gonna say when I live in Manhattan surrounded by fire?

67
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,055
Speaker 1: I feel like at that point.

68
00:04:19,075 --> 00:04:22,410
Speaker 1: I'm already on my bike with the rabbits in a backpack like making my way out of town.

69
00:04:22,493 --> 00:04:24,091
Speaker 0: You're not You're.

70
00:04:24,152 --> 00:04:24,874
Speaker 0: you're not gonna make it through.

71
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:27,041
Speaker 1: the firewall depends on how high that firewall is.

72
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,706
Speaker 1: the Staten Island Bridge is pretty high.

73
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:29,830
Speaker 1: the Arizona Narrows.

74
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:32,949
Speaker 0: You're on Manhattan and you're inside the fire ring.

75
00:04:33,912 --> 00:04:34,995
Speaker 1: How tall is the fire ring?

76
00:04:35,256 --> 00:04:40,210
Speaker 1: is it over the Queensborough Bridge because if it's not I could walk over the top of the Queensborough Bridge.

77
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:40,777
Speaker 1: There's a little pad.

78
00:04:40,797 --> 00:04:41,648
Speaker 0: there you get cooked.

79
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,560
Speaker 1: Depends depends on how hot this fire is.

80
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,349
Speaker 0: the bridge is gonna be a nice grill.

81
00:04:48,253 --> 00:04:52,130
Speaker 1: We get some rim egg and cheese or I'll walk through the East River tunnel.

82
00:04:53,311 --> 00:04:55,559
Speaker 1: Fire's not in there and outside.

83
00:04:55,579 --> 00:04:56,462
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

84
00:04:56,482 --> 00:04:58,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, you'll get I got plans for everything.

85
00:04:59,516 --> 00:05:02,415
Speaker 1: Yeah Scott has a pretty good news.

86
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:03,739
Speaker 0: What's all my news?

87
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:08,916
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, so we talked about a lot about Internet of things and how.

88
00:05:08,936 --> 00:05:12,890
Speaker 0: you know, there's a lot of terms going on these days like cloud and Internet of Things.

89
00:05:12,954 --> 00:05:14,320
Speaker 0: Yeah we also have a cloud.

90
00:05:14,461 --> 00:05:16,775
Speaker 0: actually just means someone else's computer.

91
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:19,043
Speaker 0: if you ever see an article with the use of the word cloud.

92
00:05:19,063 --> 00:05:19,324
Speaker 0: a lot.

93
00:05:19,364 --> 00:05:23,999
Speaker 0: replace every instance of cloud with Someone else's computer and it will make perfect sense.

94
00:05:24,119 --> 00:05:24,440
Speaker 0: That's all.

95
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,363
Speaker 0: cloud is right.

96
00:05:25,764 --> 00:05:29,804
Speaker 0: Internet of Things simply means Thing that doesn't look like a computer.

97
00:05:29,845 --> 00:05:30,630
Speaker 0: That is a computer.

98
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:45,544
Speaker 0: Yep, for example, if you have one of those refrigerators with a screen on it and whatever guess what that refrigerator is a computer and If it happens to connect to the internet There's a lot of computers that don't connect to the internet right like your car is a computer or

99
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:47,794
Speaker 1: like the computer in Mission Impossible One

100
00:05:48,136 --> 00:05:50,029
Speaker 0: right is a computer doesn't connect to the internet.

101
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:59,243
Speaker 0: But if you have a computer in a thing that normally doesn't look like a computer But it connects to the internet now you have Internet of Things.

102
00:05:59,524 --> 00:06:01,712
Speaker 0: right computers hidden in places You didn't know

103
00:06:01,853 --> 00:06:14,110
Speaker 1: usually gets a little more nuanced and that almost now I'd say 99% of the time people specifically mean Something that does a physical thing in the real world like tracks the food in your fridge or lets you turn off a light.

104
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:17,544
Speaker 0: Right, but you know, it's a smart TV is Internet of Things.

105
00:06:17,605 --> 00:06:22,524
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's it's a computer That's that's your TV now has a computer attached to it hidden inside.

106
00:06:22,565 --> 00:06:29,510
Speaker 1: because as a technology professional What Internet of Things means to me is that thing does not get updates, right?

107
00:06:29,590 --> 00:06:30,614
Speaker 0: It's basically a device.

108
00:06:30,855 --> 00:06:34,790
Speaker 0: right and this is the main problem with them is you have basically full-on computers.

109
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:35,733
Speaker 0: They got CPUs.

110
00:06:36,134 --> 00:06:36,776
Speaker 0: They got RAM.

111
00:06:36,817 --> 00:06:37,900
Speaker 1: They're connected to your Wi-Fi.

112
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,754
Speaker 0: probably really as long as you have a CPU RAM and a network card That's enough.

113
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,104
Speaker 0: Yeah that to do damage and a power source.

114
00:06:44,425 --> 00:06:45,510
Speaker 0: That's enough to do damage.

115
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:50,304
Speaker 0: Yeah, any CPU with RAM and a network card can now do evil.

116
00:06:50,405 --> 00:06:52,190
Speaker 0: it can send spam emails.

117
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:54,470
Speaker 0: It can attempt to hack other computers.

118
00:06:54,651 --> 00:06:59,690
Speaker 1: It could turn your light switch on and off again so rapidly that it literally starts a fire in your house.

119
00:06:59,871 --> 00:07:00,153
Speaker 0: It gets.

120
00:07:00,193 --> 00:07:03,313
Speaker 0: try to send SSH, you know Connections.

121
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,143
Speaker 0: it can do anything that a CPU can do which is all the things.

122
00:07:06,164 --> 00:07:06,244
Speaker 0: well.

123
00:07:07,950 --> 00:07:13,970
Speaker 1: So if you do anything that can be accomplished by some combination of adding ones and zeros together, right?

124
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,030
Speaker 0: So like those fancy thermostats people have or what else?

125
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:22,283
Speaker 1: The secure those malware mail me one Bitcoin or the temperature was up by one degree per hour.

126
00:07:22,363 --> 00:07:27,057
Speaker 1: the garage door openers with Wi-Fi They only one Bitcoin or I break your car right.

127
00:07:27,258 --> 00:07:36,798
Speaker 0: all these sorts of devices that have an internet connection in a CPU and RAM hidden in them are Computers that are not being properly taken care of.

128
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:45,183
Speaker 0: the people who have them don't recognize them as computers and if you connect them To the Internet somebody can Hijack them connect to them use them in ways.

129
00:07:45,223 --> 00:07:46,470
Speaker 0: They weren't intended to be used.

130
00:07:46,891 --> 00:07:49,338
Speaker 0: You know your garage, you're literally not even a joke.

131
00:07:49,378 --> 00:07:59,350
Speaker 0: your garage door opener could be made to like send spams or Host child porn on its meager storage or who knows what yep mine mine bitcoins.

132
00:07:59,871 --> 00:08:06,290
Speaker 1: So there's a concept that's a little deeper than a firewall because a firewall is just some rules around the network traffic.

133
00:08:06,571 --> 00:08:10,794
Speaker 1: But the computer on the other side is still connected to the network Like it's.

134
00:08:10,814 --> 00:08:16,207
Speaker 1: still two people are connecting to it effectively directly to do stuff Unless you have a fancy like layer 7 firewall.

135
00:08:16,691 --> 00:08:21,105
Speaker 1: But the air gap is an important concept in IT security.

136
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:32,184
Speaker 1: if something is so important that Like it's serious like capital s serious Usually those are systems that are not connected to the internet at all.

137
00:08:32,326 --> 00:08:32,506
Speaker 1: Yep.

138
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:38,450
Speaker 1: There is no path There is no IP anywhere that will get between that computer and the internet.

139
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:40,720
Speaker 0: yep, like in our IT we had this.

140
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:44,280
Speaker 0: I took a computer security class and You nothing.

141
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:53,370
Speaker 0: in that lab in that room there's a bunch of racks and a whole bunch of tables with like patches on them and All these desktops in there in that room at all the at all the desks.

142
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:56,402
Speaker 0: Oh, but there was no internet connection in that room.

143
00:08:56,462 --> 00:09:04,250
Speaker 0: if we wanted to bring software into the room We had to go outside with a USB stick load it up bring it in USB stick son.

144
00:09:04,511 --> 00:09:05,938
Speaker 1: I used a zip disk for that.

145
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:10,595
Speaker 0: I used USB sticks because it was 2004 or whatever it was.

146
00:09:10,615 --> 00:09:11,418
Speaker 1: Yeah, I was.

147
00:09:11,438 --> 00:09:11,920
Speaker 1: I took that.

148
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,726
Speaker 1: collect the collect the equivalent class in 2000.

149
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:18,530
Speaker 0: Yeah The point is we had to bring software from the outside, right?

150
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:27,599
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like the Mission Impossible computer or say the computer that already a lot of times you just bring laptops in Already loaded and put like the computer that launches nukes.

151
00:09:28,141 --> 00:09:35,229
Speaker 1: even if you have the best internet security and firewalls on earth It's probably safer to just not actually have a connection to it.

152
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:45,629
Speaker 0: Anyway, so I you know, usually practically speaking this usually comes up in casual conversation because I can tell people hey You shouldn't be getting those, you know boxes, you know connected to your TV.

153
00:09:45,911 --> 00:09:49,858
Speaker 0: You should be getting an HD PC that you can update and has real software You should not be getting.

154
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:55,690
Speaker 0: if you have a smart TV Don't connect it to the internet and don't use any of the smart features get an HD PC, right?

155
00:09:55,950 --> 00:10:00,790
Speaker 0: This is the usual conversation we have because I'm talking about the insecurity of internet of things stuff.

156
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:03,944
Speaker 0: Right because those you know that you're not getting software updates.

157
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:05,350
Speaker 0: You don't know what the hell software is on there.

158
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:06,595
Speaker 0: You've connected it to your network.

159
00:10:06,615 --> 00:10:09,646
Speaker 0: You're putting everything at risk connecting some strange computer to your network.

160
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:11,774
Speaker 0: But here we go We have a real story.

161
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:12,677
Speaker 0: This really happened.

162
00:10:12,697 --> 00:10:13,581
Speaker 0: It's not sci-fi.

163
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:14,645
Speaker 0: It's not some example.

164
00:10:14,665 --> 00:10:15,930
Speaker 0: Well, it is an example.

165
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:16,975
Speaker 0: It's a real example.

166
00:10:17,015 --> 00:10:18,623
Speaker 0: this thing actually fucking happened.

167
00:10:19,366 --> 00:10:26,230
Speaker 0: some casino Had in the fish tank that was at the front of the casino as a decoration because you know casinos got fancy decorations.

168
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:32,790
Speaker 0: Yeah, a internet controlled thermometer thermostat thing to control and monitor the temperature in the fish tank.

169
00:10:33,311 --> 00:10:36,440
Speaker 0: But this wasn't just a thermometer like mercury and a stick.

170
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,910
Speaker 0: it was a computer with an internet connection that connected to where the Wi-Fi.

171
00:10:39,970 --> 00:10:41,034
Speaker 0: Yeah, right.

172
00:10:41,757 --> 00:10:43,061
Speaker 0: You just don't think of it as a computer.

173
00:10:43,081 --> 00:10:45,410
Speaker 0: You just you know, you think of it as fucking thermometer.

174
00:10:45,992 --> 00:10:57,950
Speaker 0: So, of course somebody hijacked that and now that's a computer that was on the casinos computer network And they went in through that very insecure thermostat connected to the casinos other computers that had real things.

175
00:10:58,192 --> 00:11:12,429
Speaker 1: I didn't look up the details of this particular Thermostat but generally the reason why these are never things things are so dangerous and even these contacts is that you connect it to your Internal network, but it's not directly accessible from the outside kind of like with Skype back in the day.

176
00:11:12,932 --> 00:11:16,990
Speaker 1: These these Internet of Things devices have to work when idiots are involved.

177
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:22,894
Speaker 1: So they are good at net busting and getting out to the internet to connect to some server somewhere To do their biz.

178
00:11:22,914 --> 00:11:36,670
Speaker 0: a lot of them are like these, you know, like for example the NAS I have you know Synology, yeah, it's like it connects to like this Synology stuff That's way out on the real internet like to help you if you don't know how to do land stuff in your house.

179
00:11:36,690 --> 00:11:38,182
Speaker 1: Yeah, that shit's all turned off on mine.

180
00:11:38,202 --> 00:11:43,286
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly It's like you can go to find that Synology calm and then it helps you.

181
00:11:43,306 --> 00:11:46,462
Speaker 0: that thing That's on the real internet helps you find something on your land.

182
00:11:46,482 --> 00:11:51,322
Speaker 0: It's like no no land only We're not having my NAS that's on my local network.

183
00:11:51,343 --> 00:11:52,930
Speaker 0: Talk to anything else outside.

184
00:11:53,131 --> 00:12:03,670
Speaker 0: So people will install these Internet of Things things on an internal secure network like web like someone will set up a webcam Those the worst security webcam and then in order to see what the webcam sees you go to a website.

185
00:12:03,851 --> 00:12:06,570
Speaker 0: That's on the public internet and now everyone can see everything that's it going on.

186
00:12:06,811 --> 00:12:11,529
Speaker 0: Yes, and even you didn't open as opposed to connecting directly to it from you know, wherever you are.

187
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:21,984
Speaker 1: Yep So if anything on that server that web thing that's letting this webcam do its thing is compromised at all You can get into the webcam and do whatever on the internal network.

188
00:12:22,024 --> 00:12:23,390
Speaker 0: someone used this thermometer.

189
00:12:23,732 --> 00:12:26,165
Speaker 0: They hijacked at that and then now they're on that.

190
00:12:26,205 --> 00:12:27,030
Speaker 0: they had a connection.

191
00:12:27,110 --> 00:12:36,561
Speaker 0: They were able to browse the casinos internal computer network and they found a database that was not so secure and that database had all Info about all the high rollers in the casinos.

192
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,183
Speaker 0: Yeah.

193
00:12:37,444 --> 00:12:38,870
Speaker 1: Okay, this is fun stuff.

194
00:12:39,111 --> 00:12:53,397
Speaker 1: now this is not the crazier exploits that people in talking about about using To get at completely air gap systems meaning has nothing to do with it now, but that's a similar but more Interesting story.

195
00:12:53,458 --> 00:13:00,807
Speaker 0: there are ways, you know, depending on what's going on You can try to hack into systems that aren't connected to the internet, but it's extremely difficult.

196
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:04,170
Speaker 0: Yeah point is There are things that are computers.

197
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:09,039
Speaker 0: You need to be able to recognize what is and what is not a computer and in the future Everything is a computer.

198
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:20,138
Speaker 0: if something is a computer do not put it on your network unless you have somehow separated it or something and Make sure you you know don't let it connect it if it doesn't have to.

199
00:13:20,198 --> 00:13:27,369
Speaker 0: you can get one of those internet connectable garage door openers and never Connect it to the internet and just open your enclosure garage door without any Wi-Fi.

200
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:36,830
Speaker 1: yep, or if you're gonna use its internet stuff at least put it on a Segregated Wi-Fi network that doesn't have any access to the rest of your network.

201
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:38,017
Speaker 0: Yeah, and then it's like, okay.

202
00:13:38,057 --> 00:13:39,989
Speaker 0: Well, here's this thing on its own this smart TV.

203
00:13:40,331 --> 00:13:43,643
Speaker 0: It might start sending spam to the internet and does whatever.

204
00:13:43,723 --> 00:13:45,470
Speaker 0: the worst it can do is use my bandwidth.

205
00:13:45,631 --> 00:13:48,885
Speaker 0: It can't hurt anything any of my other real computers or anything.

206
00:13:49,246 --> 00:13:50,090
Speaker 0: It's all on its own.

207
00:13:50,191 --> 00:13:53,910
Speaker 0: It might as well have its own private internet connection that it shares with nothing else.

208
00:13:54,432 --> 00:13:59,810
Speaker 0: And if it becomes horrible and using my bandwidth then I'll disconnect it and I can take advantage of its features in the meantime.

209
00:14:00,551 --> 00:14:03,868
Speaker 0: So in some other news, but ideally just don't connect it in the first place you want the problem.

210
00:14:03,948 --> 00:14:04,089
Speaker 0: Yep.

211
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:07,280
Speaker 1: So in some other news, I just saw this story.

212
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:10,150
Speaker 1: I remember seeing some rumblings about this and it's kind of interesting.

213
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:11,655
Speaker 1: I'm gonna summarize to.

214
00:14:11,675 --> 00:14:21,887
Speaker 1: the details are pretty technical and they rely on some understanding of the plain old Television set like the plain old television the plain old telephony networks like old phone pots.

215
00:14:22,248 --> 00:14:22,950
Speaker 1: Yeah pots.

216
00:14:23,912 --> 00:14:42,256
Speaker 1: so basically the way phones like phone calls work in the US is actually very well defined and modern internet-based telephony largely fakes a lot of that stuff or Translates between that stuff.

217
00:14:42,376 --> 00:14:56,590
Speaker 1: So like for example in the old days if you picked up a phone and by the old days I mean like the 90s and you called someone on the phone Like you picked up a landline if you've ever seen one of those people and yet rotary dialed something.

218
00:14:56,852 --> 00:14:59,169
Speaker 1: Whoa, I had a read a rotary dial when I was a kid.

219
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:03,886
Speaker 0: We're talking 90s, all right, you had a Phineas's key modem and you do dialed someone 80.

220
00:15:03,886 --> 00:15:18,176
Speaker 1: Yep right so The ringing sound you hear in the phone actually means like that is a part of the SLA of the phone network that the Destination phone is ringing.

221
00:15:18,557 --> 00:15:22,848
Speaker 0: I thought the destination phone was actually making those noises and sending them over the phone line to you.

222
00:15:23,509 --> 00:15:25,722
Speaker 1: Uh I'm pretty sure that was.

223
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:26,790
Speaker 0: you call different places.

224
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,538
Speaker 0: You heard different rings based on what phone they had.

225
00:15:28,578 --> 00:15:30,447
Speaker 1: pretty sure that wasn't actually true in the 90s.

226
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,201
Speaker 1: but I'm not actually that familiar with the previous iterations of the phone like

227
00:15:34,221 --> 00:15:44,750
Speaker 0: that like when the person picks up the phone they start talking and You hear and their voice gets sent over the line But before then the phone that has now received a call is and ringing out loud is also sending ringing noise.

228
00:15:44,770 --> 00:15:45,895
Speaker 0: What's crazy line to you.

229
00:15:46,076 --> 00:15:49,069
Speaker 1: is my freshman year wrong, but that's what I thought my freshman year.

230
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:54,390
Speaker 1: at RIT I actually took a whole class on this stuff and I mostly forgot it all because it's literally irrelevant to the modern world.

231
00:15:54,652 --> 00:15:56,892
Speaker 0: Yeah, unless you're setting up an asterisk server Which you're not.

232
00:15:57,033 --> 00:16:01,972
Speaker 1: but like the sound that a phone makes when you try to call someone in the phone is busy Like that.

233
00:16:02,012 --> 00:16:08,349
Speaker 1: DDD like all those things are very well-defined and there's rules about them and more importantly there's laws about them.

234
00:16:08,549 --> 00:16:15,550
Speaker 1: Yep So this story is fascinating and I'm only gonna skim the details because partly there's a broader story.

235
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:17,799
Speaker 1: I want to talk about the rough story here.

236
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:21,880
Speaker 1: Is that t-mobile was caught Faking the ring?

237
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,290
Speaker 1: sounds that come back.

238
00:16:23,430 --> 00:16:25,477
Speaker 0: Why would you want to fake the ring sound?

239
00:16:25,598 --> 00:16:29,150
Speaker 1: because the old phone network the hyper?

240
00:16:29,270 --> 00:16:32,736
Speaker 1: reliable phone network with all those mechanical relays and everything.

241
00:16:32,756 --> 00:16:33,077
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

242
00:16:33,197 --> 00:16:43,424
Speaker 1: It's really expensive to run and Really really really expensive to run in Shit-ass rural burg like a middle-of-nowhere, Arizona, right?

243
00:16:43,464 --> 00:16:44,166
Speaker 0: But it's still there.

244
00:16:44,206 --> 00:16:45,750
Speaker 0: You could just you connect someone to it.

245
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:46,529
Speaker 0: What's a big degree?

246
00:16:47,034 --> 00:16:52,230
Speaker 0: But there's a lot of things going on For it, whoever's whoever's in that area pays.

247
00:16:52,250 --> 00:17:02,758
Speaker 1: So part of the reason that worked is there was a limited number of phone companies and the infrastructure is relatively simple And they all sort of followed the same rules, but in the modern world of the Internet there's a lot of ways to connect calls.

248
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:20,690
Speaker 1: most people are using cell phones exclusively and It might just be that a cell phone trying to make a call Going through all these different networks that are run by all these different private companies Might time out or otherwise not make it to some shit-ass rural phone somewhere that still has some old physical infrastructure.

249
00:17:21,531 --> 00:17:24,465
Speaker 0: So rather than I don't know every time I've called the landline it works.

250
00:17:25,069 --> 00:17:27,703
Speaker 1: Uh I'm trying to think of the last time I call the landline.

251
00:17:27,723 --> 00:17:29,373
Speaker 1: that wasn't like an 800.

252
00:17:29,373 --> 00:17:32,204
Speaker 0: you live in a farm in the sticks and you have a telephone.

253
00:17:32,385 --> 00:17:33,650
Speaker 0: let us know we'll try to call you.

254
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:38,595
Speaker 0: We will both try to call you first come first serve Like you need to be in the way.

255
00:17:38,635 --> 00:17:39,700
Speaker 0: sticks way.

256
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,070
Speaker 0: Yeah, and you have a landline most in the forum.

257
00:17:42,291 --> 00:18:02,014
Speaker 1: we'll decide if you're sticks enough, yeah, but basically there's a bunch of things going on because a lot of the phone networks in rural areas are selling numbers in those areas to companies that then provide telephony services to other areas because it's way cheaper to connect or The air.

258
00:18:02,054 --> 00:18:05,770
Speaker 1: the infrastructure those phone numbers run on is subsidized by old federal nonsense.

259
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:15,010
Speaker 1: so that's why you can go to all these services and pay like 20 bucks a month and get as many 888 numbers as you want and just like route calls everywhere All right.

260
00:18:15,311 --> 00:18:19,285
Speaker 1: But what this means is this is a lot of the SLA of the phone network is starting to fail.

261
00:18:19,305 --> 00:18:21,935
Speaker 0: still haven't explained why t-mobile Would fake the ringing noise.

262
00:18:22,136 --> 00:18:23,140
Speaker 0: what is what is t-mobile?

263
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,930
Speaker 1: give a shit because t-mobile tries to connect to some destination.

264
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:30,510
Speaker 0: All right, so I have t-mobile phone and I'm in New York City with my t-mobile smartphone.

265
00:18:30,871 --> 00:18:32,899
Speaker 0: So I'm a t-mobile iPhone and I call.

266
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,470
Speaker 0: the person who lives in the sticks is listening to this show.

267
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,061
Speaker 0: So why does t-mobile give a shit just connect the call?

268
00:18:38,342 --> 00:18:40,230
Speaker 0: So yeah, why would you fake the ringing noise?

269
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:52,688
Speaker 1: so they're trying to connect the call but the call the the circuit might not actually be open to that destination for a Significant amount of time because of all these complications in the I want to see mobile characters.

270
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:53,110
Speaker 0: Let me wait.

271
00:18:53,672 --> 00:18:58,150
Speaker 0: So you call you always I'm used to that where you call and like there's a silent noise and you go, huh?

272
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,865
Speaker 0: Why isn't it ringing and eventually it rings.

273
00:18:59,905 --> 00:19:00,369
Speaker 0: that happens?

274
00:19:00,810 --> 00:19:04,250
Speaker 1: Yeah, so the it might have been too long or they didn't want to worry about it.

275
00:19:04,491 --> 00:19:09,762
Speaker 1: It was much easier to just always start playing a ringtone back at whoever called Well separately.

276
00:19:09,782 --> 00:19:10,449
Speaker 1: you're trying to connect.

277
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:12,826
Speaker 0: Okay, why would you do that?

278
00:19:14,351 --> 00:19:15,196
Speaker 1: I'm not t-mobile.

279
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:17,589
Speaker 0: like the person let the person wait one.

280
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:20,039
Speaker 0: I don't understand the benefit to t-mobile.

281
00:19:20,059 --> 00:19:23,214
Speaker 1: if I try to call anyone and I don't hear a ring like right away I just hang up.

282
00:19:23,254 --> 00:19:23,658
Speaker 1: I just give up.

283
00:19:23,698 --> 00:19:25,230
Speaker 0: and what is t-mobile should like that?

284
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:28,968
Speaker 0: Yeah, why don't I send the benefit to t-mobile of?

285
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,670
Speaker 1: Mobile, I don't know why they went down.

286
00:19:31,690 --> 00:19:34,424
Speaker 0: Well, that's key to understanding the story because that's the thing they did.

287
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:36,337
Speaker 0: that was supposedly bad But I don't know why.

288
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:37,748
Speaker 0: what benefit they get from doing it?

289
00:19:38,251 --> 00:19:38,612
Speaker 1: partly?

290
00:19:38,672 --> 00:19:53,138
Speaker 1: I think it was just to simplify their own infrastructure by not having to track all the way to the end destination if you made it there and when that phone actually started ringing before you come all the way back and play a specific SLA based ringtone on the other

291
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:56,813
Speaker 0: feel like that's how just the phone system would work by default and you have to do extra Work to me.

292
00:19:56,853 --> 00:19:58,322
Speaker 0: No, it's now again.

293
00:19:58,362 --> 00:19:59,810
Speaker 1: It's that's not how it works anymore.

294
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:07,510
Speaker 1: It's way more complicated than it used to be and frankly that SLA is probably fundamentally obsolete, but it's still regulated.

295
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:09,839
Speaker 1: It's still part of the FCC rules.

296
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,230
Speaker 1: The rules about how phones work are very strict

297
00:20:12,992 --> 00:20:13,694
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm,

298
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:26,233
Speaker 1: and the meta point I want to make is that I think the reason it took so long That for anyone even notice or do anything about this is that most people your cell phones don't give a fuck and rarely if ever Make phone calls.

299
00:20:26,654 --> 00:20:31,530
Speaker 1: Yes, and when they do they're almost always calling someone else who's also on a cell phone.

300
00:20:32,550 --> 00:20:38,530
Speaker 1: So the reason why this issue made it as long as it did is partly that people like us don't call people.

301
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:45,071
Speaker 1: And if we do call people I use modern technology like the internet and I don't try to call a landline Mm-hmm.

302
00:20:45,413 --> 00:20:46,216
Speaker 0: I don't think the sticks.

303
00:20:46,617 --> 00:20:49,890
Speaker 1: I don't think I've tried to call a landline in a decade.

304
00:20:49,950 --> 00:20:51,395
Speaker 0: I've called my mom's phone, which is a landline.

305
00:20:51,415 --> 00:20:52,520
Speaker 0: My mom doesn't have a landline.

306
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:53,443
Speaker 0: My mom does.

307
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:55,390
Speaker 1: No relative of mine has a landline.

308
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,855
Speaker 0: Even though it is a landline.

309
00:20:56,936 --> 00:21:00,010
Speaker 0: I think it is provided by the cable company.

310
00:21:00,111 --> 00:21:10,650
Speaker 0: So I think technically it's like a VoIP phone that just has the phone number Of the former landline that was in the house And I think it might even use the landline in the house like it connects to it.

311
00:21:10,891 --> 00:21:14,230
Speaker 0: But I think that I could get a landline, but I think that basically it's like it's like an old.

312
00:21:14,310 --> 00:21:16,810
Speaker 0: It's like an old-school phone with an old-school landline wire.

313
00:21:17,292 --> 00:21:22,470
Speaker 0: But then when you get outside to where the connection is actually it's can that you know that old?

314
00:21:22,731 --> 00:21:24,662
Speaker 0: It's cooking up to some sort of VoIP transceiver.

315
00:21:24,682 --> 00:21:28,483
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, I mean I got an rj11 I could just use and it plugs into my files box.

316
00:21:28,524 --> 00:21:29,630
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's something like that, right?

317
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,794
Speaker 0: Yeah, I think that's what it is where it's.

318
00:21:30,895 --> 00:21:33,224
Speaker 0: it's a landline, but it's not really so.

319
00:21:33,344 --> 00:21:38,030
Speaker 1: this is a kind of complicated story And you can read the article if you're really interested in the details.

320
00:21:38,110 --> 00:21:41,139
Speaker 1: But basically t-mobile is getting fined a pittance for this.

321
00:21:41,862 --> 00:21:47,997
Speaker 1: and this is the other meta story the FCC Because American politics is completely fucked right now.

322
00:21:48,017 --> 00:21:49,822
Speaker 0: The FCC is just basically the worst.

323
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:58,070
Speaker 1: Yeah, but they're even worse now Because they're controlled by the Republican Party, which is the bad party in the US.

324
00:21:58,551 --> 00:22:08,017
Speaker 1: So the Democrats actually wanted to take much more aggressive action to deal with the fundamental problem of Phone companies are ignoring most of America.

325
00:22:08,037 --> 00:22:10,103
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, at least bland wise.

326
00:22:10,364 --> 00:22:19,530
Speaker 1: Yep, and kind of like the post office We need to provide basic connectivity services to everywhere people live regardless of how economically viable.

327
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,850
Speaker 0: I mean FCC are not Democrat or Republican or not.

328
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:27,870
Speaker 0: Show me a time where a company was actually fined and a major company was fined and punished.

329
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:30,461
Speaker 0: An actual significant amount like they should be.

330
00:22:30,783 --> 00:22:32,370
Speaker 0: I can only think of like a few handful.

331
00:22:32,511 --> 00:22:34,826
Speaker 0: So these are completely breaking up AT&T.

332
00:22:34,967 --> 00:22:39,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, these Right There's not a lot of them, right?

333
00:22:39,390 --> 00:22:47,900
Speaker 0: There's not a lot of times when companies have actually been punished a proportionate amount, but in this case in particular The Democrats.

334
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:56,994
Speaker 1: because basically the Minority on this because the Republicans are in power so they get the majority meaning they can literally do whatever they want Ignoring the Democrats.

335
00:22:57,536 --> 00:23:02,710
Speaker 1: so they basically did this like minimum fine and are just sort of ignoring the issue.

336
00:23:02,833 --> 00:23:08,930
Speaker 0: Yeah I don't even understand the point of having the two opposing people there just so they can say what they is as the Democrat.

337
00:23:09,031 --> 00:23:09,272
Speaker 0: It's like.

338
00:23:09,352 --> 00:23:12,510
Speaker 0: it's basically just so you can let everyone know that it's bullshit.

339
00:23:12,691 --> 00:23:15,870
Speaker 0: And I guess occasionally when you agree and you vote it's just symbolic, right?

340
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:16,352
Speaker 0: It's sort of like.

341
00:23:16,372 --> 00:23:17,276
Speaker 0: well, you can see.

342
00:23:17,316 --> 00:23:19,505
Speaker 0: well, we disagree and all voted.

343
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:20,308
Speaker 0: Yes, so clearly.

344
00:23:20,368 --> 00:23:20,810
Speaker 0: this is good.

345
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:35,350
Speaker 1: This is a pretty recent phenomenon and all these committees where previously There would more often than you would expect be some sort of compromise or they'd argue behind closed doors And then they just present like they'd vote unanimously or close.

346
00:23:35,611 --> 00:23:39,590
Speaker 0: I'm pretty sure I remember when they were doing all this stuff during the Obama times.

347
00:23:39,671 --> 00:23:41,260
Speaker 0: It was usually three to all the time.

348
00:23:41,341 --> 00:23:48,669
Speaker 1: Also, it depends It's gotten to the point that it is the rule as opposed to the exception in the last year.

349
00:23:49,674 --> 00:24:02,168
Speaker 1: But basically the Democrat made a good point that this affected billions of telephone calls to rural areas over the last several years and is a quote massively deceptive and harmful violation.

350
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:10,690
Speaker 1: and The FCC will net will not even look at changing these rules will not even look at updating like basic connectivity services.

351
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:18,350
Speaker 1: I mean I would argue that broadband connectivity to these rural areas should be a right way more important than plain old telephone nonsense.

352
00:24:18,699 --> 00:24:19,130
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah.

353
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:29,379
Speaker 0: I mean also if I was in charge of the world anytime anyone got fined for anything the fine would always be Proportional to their means and significance.

354
00:24:29,419 --> 00:24:40,173
Speaker 0: So if like you're a poor person and you know the iron monkey strategy Yeah, if you're a poor person you do some crime like littering I'd be like one dollar fine and they'd be like no God damn it.

355
00:24:40,214 --> 00:24:40,716
Speaker 0: I can't.

356
00:24:40,756 --> 00:24:41,499
Speaker 0: they'd be pissed off.

357
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,081
Speaker 0: There's like a whole.

358
00:24:42,302 --> 00:24:43,165
Speaker 0: it's a big deal, right.

359
00:24:43,486 --> 00:24:52,390
Speaker 0: and if Bill Gates litters Fucking hundred million dollar fine go fuck yourself Bill Gates Same littering but it has to be an amount where he like he'll be like, ah shit, right?

360
00:24:53,193 --> 00:24:55,410
Speaker 0: So 40 million dollars t-mobile doesn't even give a shit, right?

361
00:24:56,050 --> 00:25:01,490
Speaker 0: If you find any company ever it has to be enough to make their stock go down and people sell off.

362
00:25:02,330 --> 00:25:04,581
Speaker 0: That's the only because that's the only way the CEO will be hurt.

363
00:25:04,641 --> 00:25:06,530
Speaker 0: right is that the stock has to go down significantly.

364
00:25:06,731 --> 00:25:12,836
Speaker 0: So what it's like what's t-mobile's like total worth like some billions 25% of your worth.

365
00:25:12,917 --> 00:25:13,821
Speaker 0: here's one minimum.

366
00:25:13,901 --> 00:25:17,824
Speaker 1: This is probably the first time where I'm gonna go beyond you So you're gonna find him even harder.

367
00:25:17,844 --> 00:25:25,246
Speaker 1: So I generally Ideologically disagree with the death penalty for basic for criminal law.

368
00:25:25,547 --> 00:25:32,089
Speaker 1: Yeah I Don't want to get into the details of that argument that discussion mean death penalty for a company?

369
00:25:32,129 --> 00:25:35,430
Speaker 0: sure But I mean don't think you give t-mobile the death penalty if it is.

370
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:41,416
Speaker 1: Oh, no, but I'm saying if there is a death penalty for humans Irrespective of whether or not.

371
00:25:41,476 --> 00:25:48,600
Speaker 1: that is the right thing to have if it exists and Corporations are ostensibly treated like humans for many purposes.

372
00:25:48,961 --> 00:25:51,750
Speaker 1: Then there should also be a death penalty for corporations.

373
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:52,633
Speaker 0: Yeah, but this isn't.

374
00:25:52,694 --> 00:26:00,507
Speaker 0: this isn't bad enough to warn the death penalty for t-mobile, but there are many corporations For example, I don't know any company that like poisons a river.

375
00:26:00,527 --> 00:26:05,190
Speaker 0: It's like yeah Yeah I think not only should you give the death penalty but all the executives should go to real jail.

376
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:09,009
Speaker 1: But the other sort of a more subtle point to think about is that whenever you're building new things?

377
00:26:10,112 --> 00:26:21,255
Speaker 1: It is important that the people who are building the new thing at least someone building the new thing Understands what the old thing they're replacing did and why it did what I what it did I think I do.

378
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:21,938
Speaker 0: they just don't give a shit.

379
00:26:22,321 --> 00:26:22,683
Speaker 1: I don't know.

380
00:26:22,763 --> 00:26:23,990
Speaker 0: It's got to also care.

381
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:31,910
Speaker 1: It is very easy to believe that Having the ringtone just play through a cell phone was just some engineer saying well that makes sense.

382
00:26:32,611 --> 00:26:39,412
Speaker 1: I'm not thinking about this like physical relay connected to some copper in Oklahoma saying is like an open DNS Thing.

383
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:42,470
Speaker 0: or the people who may go up in DNS don't care how DNS is supposed to work.

384
00:26:42,550 --> 00:26:45,685
Speaker 0: Yeah, and they don't send you an NX for a non-existing domain.

385
00:26:45,705 --> 00:26:46,790
Speaker 0: They send you some other bullshit.

386
00:26:47,071 --> 00:26:51,470
Speaker 1: I wonder if the open DNS people are still mad at us for saying that they are naive.

387
00:26:51,752 --> 00:26:52,155
Speaker 0: I don't know.

388
00:26:52,195 --> 00:26:54,491
Speaker 0: open DNS is like a big thing now, but I know We are.

389
00:26:54,511 --> 00:27:01,020
Speaker 1: the ship of Well-formed DNS sailed and we lost that fight a long time ago.

390
00:27:01,221 --> 00:27:01,823
Speaker 0: No, I'm actually.

391
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:03,448
Speaker 0: everyone else provides well-formed DNS.

392
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:10,264
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, so the T the TLDs Expansion has started to pollute the core idea of a tree.

393
00:27:10,766 --> 00:27:19,550
Speaker 1: But anyway, I digress but anyway things of the day.

394
00:27:19,911 --> 00:27:36,670
Speaker 1: So the Nintendo switch is very important because this is the first mainstream console I have bought myself to play games on since the 3ds and Before that was the DS and before that was Scott and I shared that gamikube that Scott bought and before that it was the SNES.

395
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:41,246
Speaker 1: Like I I was very disengaged from consoles for a long time.

396
00:27:41,287 --> 00:27:42,210
Speaker 1: The switch is amazing.

397
00:27:42,691 --> 00:27:56,064
Speaker 1: However, this video is living proof that even a great console Pales in comparison to the same experience on a PC Can mod it and mess with it.

398
00:27:56,084 --> 00:28:03,650
Speaker 0: Mm-hmm I mean pub G. the latest and greatest craze is a mod just like counter-strike was yep And you can't mod anything on switch, right?

399
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,897
Speaker 0: Imagine if you could mod Zelda for reals.

400
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:07,462
Speaker 0: What kind of all these like?

401
00:28:07,522 --> 00:28:09,950
Speaker 0: imagine what games would emerge, right?

402
00:28:10,892 --> 00:28:18,196
Speaker 1: That would be the next pub G which is not only a mod mashup of Breath of the Wild with I think the shot.

403
00:28:18,216 --> 00:28:18,417
Speaker 0: I mean.

404
00:28:18,457 --> 00:28:23,049
Speaker 0: look at the randomize just people make because they can mod, you know The SNES games you can't mod switch games.

405
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:29,069
Speaker 1: But I think the genre of what is mashed up here is called weird shit rims into a man.

406
00:28:29,189 --> 00:28:36,710
Speaker 0: one day They're gonna have you know Like in the way the decade or so we're gonna have mods of switch Zelda and they're gonna do a randomizer.

407
00:28:37,052 --> 00:28:39,186
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah, so Breath of the Wild randomizer.

408
00:28:39,207 --> 00:28:40,753
Speaker 1: Oh my god I look.

409
00:28:40,773 --> 00:28:46,973
Speaker 1: I await the day where I can watch a Breath of the Wild where the very important item is just in some random Ass cave.

410
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:48,398
Speaker 0: It's like oh that Korok seed.

411
00:28:48,498 --> 00:28:49,582
Speaker 0: Actually, that was the key item.

412
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:50,324
Speaker 0: That was Gannon.

413
00:28:50,545 --> 00:28:51,850
Speaker 1: Yeah, Gannon is just hiding there.

414
00:28:52,271 --> 00:28:52,893
Speaker 0: Oh Triforce.

415
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:53,414
Speaker 0: Yep.

416
00:28:53,635 --> 00:29:01,249
Speaker 1: Anyway, so yeah, but also it's worth noting that the song on this thing of the day Might be one of my favorite songs.

417
00:29:02,057 --> 00:29:14,666
Speaker 0: Okay Well, let me talk to you about another song on the Wu Tang album return to the 36th chamber sung by the deceased old dirty bastard known as shimmy shimmy.

418
00:29:14,948 --> 00:29:30,131
Speaker 0: ah Here is an excellent perhaps better than the original rendition of this song by one of my favorite people mum, rah the everliving I'm like old dirty bastard is Everliving.

419
00:29:30,512 --> 00:29:38,355
Speaker 0: this is just too and also is also and like old dirty bastard is old dirty And a bastard.

420
00:29:39,038 --> 00:29:44,802
Speaker 1: I uh, I also legit like this Rendition of this song and it gives me a feel.

421
00:29:44,822 --> 00:29:46,750
Speaker 0: I don't think you know the original rendition of this song.

422
00:29:46,830 --> 00:29:47,472
Speaker 1: I don't know Wu Tang.

423
00:29:47,492 --> 00:29:48,495
Speaker 1: that well, okay.

424
00:29:48,635 --> 00:29:53,229
Speaker 0: Can you name more than one Wu Tang member that I already named?

425
00:29:53,329 --> 00:30:03,777
Speaker 1: Nope Okay, just so we put that in terms of rims music in that in that in that that area of music like things I enjoy I knew the Wu Tang clan existed.

426
00:30:04,339 --> 00:30:09,918
Speaker 1: All right, and when as someone has pointed out, that's a Wu Tang song I've usually thought oh, that's a pretty good song.

427
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,625
Speaker 0: Yeah, there's a reason they famous.

428
00:30:11,645 --> 00:30:13,010
Speaker 1: Yeah, it's about as far as they got.

429
00:30:13,454 --> 00:30:17,407
Speaker 1: I do want to hear the The album that we don't know we can't hear yet.

430
00:30:18,434 --> 00:30:24,790
Speaker 0: well Have you listened to the eco, why are you so you're so interested in listening to this unobtainable Wu Tang album?

431
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:27,224
Speaker 0: Do you realize there are Wu Tang albums?

432
00:30:27,264 --> 00:30:28,270
Speaker 0: You could already listen.

433
00:30:28,892 --> 00:30:34,629
Speaker 1: If you look at my sonos history, I was listening to a bunch of Wu Tang clan a couple weeks ago.

434
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:37,223
Speaker 1: I don't know names of songs off the top of my head.

435
00:30:37,706 --> 00:30:43,119
Speaker 0: You don't know The classic in the meta moment.

436
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:46,987
Speaker 1: the book club book is the Odyssey by Homer.

437
00:30:47,268 --> 00:30:51,050
Speaker 0: I'm not working next week So I'll probably be going on an Odyssey.

438
00:30:51,431 --> 00:30:55,144
Speaker 0: So I've gone on quite an Odyssey already and also it's shorter than I thought.

439
00:30:55,205 --> 00:30:56,690
Speaker 0: I just stopped reading it.

440
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:58,044
Speaker 1: So she got to Odysseus, right?

441
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,374
Speaker 1: Are you still a Telemachus?

442
00:31:01,076 --> 00:31:02,141
Speaker 0: I just got to Odysseus.

443
00:31:02,241 --> 00:31:03,265
Speaker 0: Okay, he's on the island.

444
00:31:03,285 --> 00:31:03,747
Speaker 0: He's on the island.

445
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,838
Speaker 0: I think he's building a raft and making his move.

446
00:31:06,959 --> 00:31:09,688
Speaker 1: Okay, so Hermes came was like yo, you got to let this guy go.

447
00:31:09,809 --> 00:31:14,430
Speaker 1: stop Stop having amazing goddess sex with him every single night.

448
00:31:14,591 --> 00:31:16,985
Speaker 0: I don't know why she doesn't have amazing goddess sex with like Hermes.

449
00:31:17,005 --> 00:31:17,810
Speaker 0: who's a god right there.

450
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:24,323
Speaker 1: my one of my favorite And Hermes wouldn't say no in the Odyssey is when Hermes is like god.

451
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:25,707
Speaker 1: damn it cuz Zeus is like Hermes.

452
00:31:25,948 --> 00:31:26,610
Speaker 1: go deal with this.

453
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:26,931
Speaker 1: He's like.

454
00:31:27,614 --> 00:31:35,660
Speaker 1: and then he goes and even he is like, whoa this island Whoa, he literally goes from Olympus to this island.

455
00:31:36,182 --> 00:31:37,587
Speaker 0: I mean Olympus isn't that great.

456
00:31:37,627 --> 00:31:38,430
Speaker 0: That's the thing, right?

457
00:31:38,490 --> 00:31:40,461
Speaker 0: Olympus is not like fuck it in paradise.

458
00:31:40,521 --> 00:31:41,567
Speaker 0: It's the top of a mountain.

459
00:31:41,587 --> 00:31:44,510
Speaker 1: It's fucking cold Yeah, but it's still opulent full of splendor.

460
00:31:45,351 --> 00:31:48,081
Speaker 0: It's better than man meat world or Hades, but it's not.

461
00:31:48,181 --> 00:31:49,868
Speaker 0: it's not as good as fucking.

462
00:31:50,109 --> 00:31:51,607
Speaker 0: you know Whatever the name of that island is.

463
00:31:54,032 --> 00:31:54,715
Speaker 1: But yeah, so we'll.

464
00:31:54,815 --> 00:31:55,819
Speaker 1: uh, this is the book club.

465
00:31:55,859 --> 00:31:56,441
Speaker 1: you should read it.

466
00:31:56,561 --> 00:31:57,204
Speaker 1: it's amazing.

467
00:31:57,464 --> 00:32:09,302
Speaker 1: Emily Wilson did a fantastic job Translating this in a way to where reading it feels like just reading a story and enjoying it for what it is Without having to parse through somewhat archaic language.

468
00:32:09,362 --> 00:32:09,703
Speaker 1: Yeah.

469
00:32:09,763 --> 00:32:19,470
Speaker 0: No what they didn't write it, you know a lot of people Intentionally write in old-timey ways and she pointed out like, you know These people make an English translation and they write it with like ye old choppy talk.

470
00:32:19,470 --> 00:32:22,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, ye old choppy talk isn't any closer, right?

471
00:32:22,790 --> 00:32:31,761
Speaker 0: The whole Greek fake old English is only like a couple hundred, you know, even if that's how they spoke Yeah, which they didn't and that would only be like 200 years ago.

472
00:32:31,781 --> 00:32:35,380
Speaker 0: Whereas Homer Odyssey is BC You're not.

473
00:32:35,724 --> 00:32:42,110
Speaker 0: it's like you Predates the Greek it predates the idea of English it predates Greece.

474
00:32:42,591 --> 00:32:44,477
Speaker 1: So this is some like there's.

475
00:32:44,577 --> 00:32:49,290
Speaker 0: no there is no point in using old-fashioned sounding language, right?

476
00:32:49,450 --> 00:32:50,847
Speaker 0: It's not that much closer.

477
00:32:52,613 --> 00:32:55,170
Speaker 1: Yeah, at least Shakespeare is a product of its time.

478
00:32:55,491 --> 00:32:58,662
Speaker 0: Yeah, Shakespeare that's is how Shakespeare, you know wrote plays.

479
00:32:58,702 --> 00:33:00,890
Speaker 0: that might not be how they talked but that's how they wrote plays.

480
00:33:02,231 --> 00:33:04,138
Speaker 0: There's the actual words that Shakespeare wrote.

481
00:33:04,198 --> 00:33:06,326
Speaker 0: Shakespeare was a person most likely we know.

482
00:33:06,346 --> 00:33:08,490
Speaker 1: so if you're listening We know more about Shakespeare.

483
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:20,267
Speaker 1: They know about Homer because you saw us at PAX East because somehow our morning panel And you're confused that we haven't even mentioned games yet filled the room which it did eventually fill the room.

484
00:33:20,387 --> 00:33:21,170
Speaker 1: They turned people away.

485
00:33:22,272 --> 00:33:23,136
Speaker 0: They feel that's awesome.

486
00:33:23,177 --> 00:33:23,659
Speaker 0: empty seats.

487
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,227
Speaker 0: Yes, I believe in.

488
00:33:25,247 --> 00:33:27,058
Speaker 1: they were smart Yeah, but they're also a ton of people.

489
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:29,010
Speaker 0: stay like if you listen to the stream not smart.

490
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:30,150
Speaker 0: They should learn from the people who left.

491
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:37,250
Speaker 1: But if you wanted that list of games you saw us and now you don't wonder why we're talking about Linux and all this nonsense.

492
00:33:37,330 --> 00:33:42,875
Speaker 1: Well, guess what geek nights is four nights Mondays our technology and Linux and stuff You probably don't care about.

493
00:33:43,136 --> 00:33:45,788
Speaker 1: Tuesdays is where you're want to listen and not not tomorrow.

494
00:33:45,809 --> 00:33:46,110
Speaker 0: Tuesday.

495
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,930
Speaker 0: You're gonna have to wait a whole week and maybe even not even then because I'm not working.

496
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:51,690
Speaker 0: Who knows if I'll be in the mood to make a podcast?

497
00:33:51,951 --> 00:34:03,826
Speaker 1: Yeah, we're on a minor hiatus But while geek nights is coming in and out while we're sort of getting our shit together because Scott and I have both made Significant life changes recently and there's a lot we got to deal with.

498
00:34:04,429 --> 00:34:12,070
Speaker 1: but We are doubling down on the YouTube content because once we do pre-production Scott and I can go our separate ways and crank it out.

499
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,536
Speaker 0: Yeah, thanks to my new computer.

500
00:34:13,596 --> 00:34:17,150
Speaker 0: I was able to make a video with much greater ease than usual.

501
00:34:17,531 --> 00:34:23,188
Speaker 0: So we have and my video skills increase slightly each time I make a video, you know, what really helped you out?

502
00:34:24,552 --> 00:34:25,235
Speaker 0: I don't need the knob.

503
00:34:25,255 --> 00:34:28,250
Speaker 0: The knob is not necessarily really underestimate the power of this knob.

504
00:34:28,411 --> 00:34:31,630
Speaker 0: I did not at any point feel that I had the need for a knob.

505
00:34:31,891 --> 00:34:35,349
Speaker 1: You never wanted to just move something one frame before you did your thing to it.

506
00:34:36,331 --> 00:34:40,266
Speaker 1: No, I don't even use my keyboard just a mouse and knob and I can do almost everything.

507
00:34:40,588 --> 00:34:41,070
Speaker 1: It's amazing.

508
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,735
Speaker 0: I used I learned the keyboard shortcuts.

509
00:34:43,297 --> 00:34:44,643
Speaker 1: Yeah, my keyboard shortcut.

510
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:49,605
Speaker 1: This does more than I got a shuttle and I got a. well anyway, I have a mouse wheel.

511
00:34:49,626 --> 00:34:50,089
Speaker 0: I'm a mouse.

512
00:34:50,491 --> 00:34:55,969
Speaker 0: Yeah mouse left and right arrows and not enough if I hold shift and push the left and right as it goes even faster.

513
00:34:56,513 --> 00:35:04,225
Speaker 0: Then I have markers so I can just push up and down and go Turn this shuttle and the speed just varies.

514
00:35:04,285 --> 00:35:05,330
Speaker 1: in an analog fashion.

515
00:35:05,431 --> 00:35:07,766
Speaker 0: I can just push the up and down or to go to exact spot.

516
00:35:07,786 --> 00:35:08,148
Speaker 0: I need to go.

517
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:10,537
Speaker 1: Uh, your timeline is much simpler.

518
00:35:10,658 --> 00:35:11,801
Speaker 1: You want me to send you what.

519
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:12,885
Speaker 1: what a geek knives presents.

520
00:35:12,905 --> 00:35:18,546
Speaker 1: your tenant project looks like The like nested sequence upon nested sequence and templates everywhere.

521
00:35:18,566 --> 00:35:19,470
Speaker 0: I think I'm good.

522
00:35:20,343 --> 00:35:27,470
Speaker 1: but anyway So our video judging and reviewing all of the anime that's coming out in the spring.

523
00:35:28,113 --> 00:35:30,025
Speaker 0: So we have not yet watched the spring season.

524
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:30,770
Speaker 0: that has already begun.

525
00:35:31,051 --> 00:35:33,058
Speaker 1: We already reviewed it all and the video is on YouTube.

526
00:35:33,078 --> 00:35:33,921
Speaker 0: We previewed it.

527
00:35:34,121 --> 00:35:35,165
Speaker 1: Oh, we reviewed it.

528
00:35:35,326 --> 00:35:35,566
Speaker 1: Sure.

529
00:35:35,587 --> 00:35:38,674
Speaker 1: We're rarely wrong Even though we don't.

530
00:35:38,955 --> 00:35:42,109
Speaker 1: it seems like we don't know how all that persona nonsense is linked together.

531
00:35:42,129 --> 00:35:46,061
Speaker 1: now I do but I don't think the persona fans even really understand.

532
00:35:46,121 --> 00:35:50,317
Speaker 0: No, they explained it to me that it's like if they're correct I'm trusting them.

533
00:35:50,457 --> 00:35:53,130
Speaker 0: Yeah that it's sort of like Final Fantasy where it's not linked together.

534
00:35:53,231 --> 00:35:56,750
Speaker 0: They just all have the sort of like some similar themes like all the Final Fantasy of chocobos.

535
00:35:57,351 --> 00:36:03,070
Speaker 0: Final Fantasy 10 is nothing to do with Final Fantasy 6 other than they both have chocobos or Boogles or whatever, right?

536
00:36:03,190 --> 00:36:09,090
Speaker 0: So personas like that, which is actually good news because I was basically avoiding persona completely because I thought it was all connected.

537
00:36:09,191 --> 00:36:11,390
Speaker 0: But now I realize I could just go to any fucking persona thing.

538
00:36:11,390 --> 00:36:14,570
Speaker 0: I don't have to give a shit and maybe that actually makes me more likely to check one out.

539
00:36:14,751 --> 00:36:19,854
Speaker 1: I watched a let's play like partially of persona for like just a little bit of it Like.

540
00:36:19,875 --> 00:36:20,859
Speaker 1: I feel like we could enjoy that.

541
00:36:20,939 --> 00:36:23,690
Speaker 0: I mean, I think it's basically just an RPG that looks like an anime, right?

542
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:28,266
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah Yeah, so I feel like we should play Yakuza games before we play this.

543
00:36:28,648 --> 00:36:29,190
Speaker 0: share whatever.

544
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:38,156
Speaker 1: But the other video that's on YouTube is that panel the 40 tabletop games you need to play from PAX East 2018 in Glorious 2k.

545
00:36:38,176 --> 00:36:41,350
Speaker 1: Well, you don't need 4k when it's just us day.

546
00:36:41,370 --> 00:36:42,596
Speaker 0: I only did 1080p is cuz.

547
00:36:42,616 --> 00:36:43,360
Speaker 0: I'm like I'm gonna shit.

548
00:36:43,842 --> 00:36:45,108
Speaker 0: I didn't know why my face in 4k.

549
00:36:45,490 --> 00:36:46,536
Speaker 1: You know why I do 2k.

550
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:47,260
Speaker 0: I recorded it in.

551
00:36:47,501 --> 00:36:49,211
Speaker 0: 4k is but I put it out into 10.

552
00:36:49,211 --> 00:36:50,334
Speaker 1: I do 2k cuz.

553
00:36:50,354 --> 00:36:51,638
Speaker 1: I did some zooms plus.

554
00:36:51,658 --> 00:36:55,190
Speaker 0: none of the other content other than the image of our face was 4k resolution.

555
00:36:55,614 --> 00:36:57,615
Speaker 0: So it would be kind of silly but

556
00:36:57,696 --> 00:37:09,890
Speaker 1: I did it because When I'm doing the picture in picture like when we're talking the slides down here and when the slides up we're down here It means if someone does have a nice monitor that little area will be like 1080p or at least 720p depending on how big.

557
00:37:09,911 --> 00:37:12,859
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah Because your cut that content was 1080p to be exactly.

558
00:37:12,899 --> 00:37:14,746
Speaker 0: none of the images of anime that I had were 1080p.

559
00:37:14,766 --> 00:37:20,045
Speaker 1: Yep So it is on YouTube and you can watch it and maybe you learn a lesson about.

560
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:25,347
Speaker 1: if you don't go to a geek nights Panel at a con it's probably just gonna be on YouTube later.

561
00:37:25,367 --> 00:37:26,110
Speaker 0: That's right.

562
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:27,476
Speaker 0: You shouldn't show up and you shouldn't.

563
00:37:27,577 --> 00:37:29,104
Speaker 0: you should basically consume none of our.

564
00:37:29,144 --> 00:37:33,870
Speaker 1: you should tell people Who don't know about our shit to go to the panel?

565
00:37:33,991 --> 00:37:44,039
Speaker 1: so one we don't waste our time talking to people already know who we are and That way you can get them to go there and then they'll see the same panel and you don't have to tell them all the games Or whatever it is.

566
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:44,990
Speaker 1: We talked about in the panel.

567
00:37:45,030 --> 00:37:46,769
Speaker 0: You just tell them to watch the YouTube video.

568
00:37:47,111 --> 00:37:54,442
Speaker 0: I fast-forward so they can you waste as few time in their life as possible but then they can go play games with that extra time to catch 22.

569
00:37:54,442 --> 00:38:05,789
Speaker 1: because if everyone learns that lesson and No one goes to our panels Then we'll have to do order into these anime panels because we don't go to anime cows anymore and record them in our houses Which is way less fun and doesn't get us free badges to conventions.

570
00:38:06,500 --> 00:38:07,150
Speaker 0: I'll just move forth.

571
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:14,010
Speaker 1: We're gonna get to I. we're gonna do a point in the future to where No one goes to panels at any convention because they're all on YouTube.

572
00:38:14,431 --> 00:38:19,770
Speaker 1: Good except anime cons because you can't put any of that stuff on YouTube because the content idea immediately takes it down.

573
00:38:20,952 --> 00:38:22,621
Speaker 1: Yeah, so destroying data.

574
00:38:22,782 --> 00:38:24,270
Speaker 1: We talked a lot about backing stuff up.

575
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,330
Speaker 1: I don't think we've talked recently about destroying things.

576
00:38:26,390 --> 00:38:33,590
Speaker 0: Well part of it is that in most cases not all cases, but most cases I find it morally reprehensible to destroy data.

577
00:38:33,851 --> 00:38:43,119
Speaker 1: I keep I have chat logs of every I am conversation I have ever had Since the ICQ days, right?

578
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:51,970
Speaker 1: I mean if you think every single conversation I've ever had I have the exact conversation when Scott and I talked online for the first time, right?

579
00:38:52,030 --> 00:38:57,450
Speaker 0: So now a lot of people might think like short-term about destroying data, right something like rims chat logs, right?

580
00:38:57,510 --> 00:39:00,945
Speaker 0: And first of all, just cuz you don't destroy the data doesn't mean you have to distribute the data.

581
00:39:00,965 --> 00:39:03,598
Speaker 1: Yeah That's a separate conversation, right?

582
00:39:03,638 --> 00:39:05,146
Speaker 1: But yeah, it's not on the internet.

583
00:39:05,166 --> 00:39:05,990
Speaker 1: I don't even on the cloud.

584
00:39:06,291 --> 00:39:08,861
Speaker 0: I always think about you know, like Library of Alexandria.

585
00:39:08,961 --> 00:39:11,190
Speaker 0: It's like ah, what a shame it was, right?

586
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:16,670
Speaker 0: So when you delete a file, you know some you started to write something and then it's no good and you delete the file.

587
00:39:16,812 --> 00:39:20,034
Speaker 0: It's like okay That was probably worthless.

588
00:39:20,295 --> 00:39:21,620
Speaker 0: You don't want anyone to see it.

589
00:39:21,961 --> 00:39:37,390
Speaker 1: But one day you'll be dead and just Just Finding my NAS and finding on that NAS the thousands of garbage pictures I took of like New York City and using that as part of their Research into what New York City was like a thousand years ago.

590
00:39:37,571 --> 00:39:42,630
Speaker 0: Even the most worthless data that you have created could be worth something, you know.

591
00:39:42,811 --> 00:39:49,822
Speaker 0: Even something that seems completely like just a text file Could be a work of art or historical artifact or who knows what.

592
00:39:50,183 --> 00:39:57,345
Speaker 0: so I'm usually don't want to delete any data But there are some things it is okay to delete for example child porn.

593
00:39:57,706 --> 00:39:58,749
Speaker 0: delete it all please.

594
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:00,379
Speaker 0: Faster the better.

595
00:40:01,064 --> 00:40:04,273
Speaker 1: one could make an argument That not deleting.

596
00:40:04,354 --> 00:40:11,070
Speaker 1: it allows AI's expert systems and law enforcement personnel to use the data from it to find.

597
00:40:11,352 --> 00:40:14,636
Speaker 0: Let us not get off topic Let us not get off top.

598
00:40:14,676 --> 00:40:18,810
Speaker 1: just saying there's a project out there where they ask people to take pictures of hotel rooms.

599
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:29,948
Speaker 1: So Researchers who have the child porn that like the FBI has gotten when they've arrested people They can try to find the kids and rescue them.

600
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:38,325
Speaker 1: point is just saying Data may have a vet intrinsic value.

601
00:40:39,028 --> 00:40:39,450
Speaker 0: anyway.

602
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,015
Speaker 0: Deleting data is usually bad.

603
00:40:42,075 --> 00:40:44,242
Speaker 0: But sometimes well, there's.

604
00:40:44,262 --> 00:40:46,108
Speaker 0: you do have to delete some data.

605
00:40:46,128 --> 00:40:47,957
Speaker 1: for examples There's two different.

606
00:40:47,977 --> 00:40:49,667
Speaker 1: there's three different levels of deleting data.

607
00:40:49,728 --> 00:40:55,049
Speaker 1: on one There's do you have data that is local that you were trying to destroy so no one ever gets it?

608
00:40:55,491 --> 00:40:59,410
Speaker 1: Versus do you have data that you don't care about preserving necessarily?

609
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:03,281
Speaker 1: Versus did you publish data and you're trying to unpublish it?

610
00:41:03,422 --> 00:41:04,525
Speaker 0: Well, that's that's not deleting.

611
00:41:04,545 --> 00:41:06,568
Speaker 0: That's unpublishing true true But anyway, okay.

612
00:41:06,690 --> 00:41:11,190
Speaker 0: So the most basic case of deleting data is my phone is running out of room, right?

613
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:19,702
Speaker 0: So obviously just go to listen to some old episode of one of a hundred episodes of eat nights about backing up Back it up somewhere else and delete it from your phone.

614
00:41:20,003 --> 00:41:21,650
Speaker 0: Now same thing applies on your computer.

615
00:41:21,731 --> 00:41:25,470
Speaker 0: It's like oh, no, my computer's hard drive is full But I need to save this information.

616
00:41:25,852 --> 00:41:32,612
Speaker 0: Put it some buy another hard drive save it somewhere else and then delete it from the place That's full like I keep by pushing the delete key Like I keep.

617
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:36,046
Speaker 1: every photo I take on my phone goes into Lightroom basically forever.

618
00:41:36,107 --> 00:41:36,930
Speaker 1: They're tiny files.

619
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:39,084
Speaker 1: They own a Google photo forever.

620
00:41:39,104 --> 00:41:40,050
Speaker 1: because they're tiny files.

621
00:41:40,393 --> 00:41:42,130
Speaker 0: I got it backed up in three clouds.

622
00:41:42,331 --> 00:41:45,807
Speaker 0: Remember cloud means other person's computer and also my NAS and also my computer.

623
00:41:45,867 --> 00:41:46,410
Speaker 0: and what help?

624
00:41:46,850 --> 00:41:48,598
Speaker 1: Cuz I might want that data someday.

625
00:41:48,859 --> 00:41:53,989
Speaker 1: the incremental cost to me of keeping that data Approaches zero on a pearl.

626
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,756
Speaker 0: I like to add them all up together.

627
00:41:55,836 --> 00:41:59,570
Speaker 0: actually it adds up to pennies a month which adds up to dollars which becomes significant.

628
00:41:59,951 --> 00:42:05,650
Speaker 1: Yeah, but the way I preserve that stuff is using mostly free surface anyway anyway.

629
00:42:06,631 --> 00:42:07,234
Speaker 0: So there's that.

630
00:42:07,314 --> 00:42:08,819
Speaker 0: that's normal deleting right?

631
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:09,181
Speaker 0: You need to.

632
00:42:09,201 --> 00:42:12,960
Speaker 0: you're not actually deleting the data from existence You're just different one.

633
00:42:12,981 --> 00:42:14,090
Speaker 0: you're doing it from one place.

634
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:17,907
Speaker 0: Okay, so now I've got something I need to actually delete from existence.

635
00:42:18,007 --> 00:42:18,329
Speaker 0: why?

636
00:42:18,349 --> 00:42:22,390
Speaker 0: well I'm selling someone this hard drive, and I've backed everything up.

637
00:42:22,731 --> 00:42:28,710
Speaker 0: I'm not deleting it from existence, but I need to make sure that whoever gets this hard drive can't recover any of that data.

638
00:42:28,971 --> 00:42:31,288
Speaker 1: Yep, and that's mostly what we're talking about right now, right?

639
00:42:31,671 --> 00:42:35,024
Speaker 0: And in that case you need a tool that has existed for a long time.

640
00:42:35,084 --> 00:42:41,425
Speaker 0: that is still probably the best tool Called D band so named after the guy who made it Derek Derek's boot and nuke.

641
00:42:41,545 --> 00:42:42,970
Speaker 0: now it boots and it nukes.

642
00:42:43,514 --> 00:42:48,499
Speaker 1: When I was young I knew this was called D band But I always assumed that stood for something fun.

643
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:52,370
Speaker 0: when you boot it it says right on the screen Derek's boot and nuke.

644
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,898
Speaker 0: Yep, it's not hiding its name somehow.

645
00:42:54,998 --> 00:42:56,442
Speaker 1: so well the first time.

646
00:42:56,482 --> 00:42:58,930
Speaker 1: I actually had to use it was way back.

647
00:42:59,010 --> 00:42:59,775
Speaker 1: I worked at IBM.

648
00:42:59,815 --> 00:43:01,586
Speaker 0: I didn't know about its RIT, and that's when I used it.

649
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,652
Speaker 1: yeah at RIT I was.

650
00:43:02,692 --> 00:43:06,066
Speaker 1: I was a co-op, and I was working in this department before I got her.

651
00:43:06,106 --> 00:43:18,116
Speaker 1: like a big job there and the thing one of the things I had to do is We had all these servers, and they were like yo Wipe out all these hard drives following these regulations.

652
00:43:18,156 --> 00:43:24,277
Speaker 1: they pointed me at this like government site of like regulations for destroying data and That's your project.

653
00:43:24,297 --> 00:43:26,189
Speaker 1: spend a few months and like get rid of all this data.

654
00:43:26,993 --> 00:43:29,685
Speaker 1: And I was like can I just take the hard drive down to drill pass press?

655
00:43:30,066 --> 00:43:51,746
Speaker 1: and they were like no We're going to reuse the hard drive somewhere mm-hmm, so I did my research and I encountered Derek's boot and nuke and I encountered that it actually did all the things that the regulations said I had to do about Overriding the data with random data a certain number of times to make sure there is no Feasible chance anyone could get that data back

656
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:52,208
Speaker 0: mm-hmm.

657
00:43:53,132 --> 00:43:53,714
Speaker 1: And I did it.

658
00:43:53,955 --> 00:43:58,430
Speaker 0: a lot of this has to do with the way magnetic hard drives work where even if you like delete files.

659
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:09,066
Speaker 0: Well all that does is usually if you have to say if you know a normal file system is Delete the pointer to the file in the file system But it's somewhere to actually you know manually control the hard drive and read all the bits.

660
00:44:09,106 --> 00:44:10,611
Speaker 0: all the bits of the file are still There.

661
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:11,253
Speaker 0: it's just.

662
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:14,565
Speaker 0: they're not listed in the file system anymore, so they don't show up right.

663
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:24,201
Speaker 0: so you know It's like even modern file system, but you know also if you do try to delete them or overwrite them a magnetic hard drive It's like well You know it's like this sort of zero.

664
00:44:24,221 --> 00:44:25,450
Speaker 0: you could sort of try to figure out.

665
00:44:26,392 --> 00:44:28,587
Speaker 0: Aha this sector is a zero, but it used to be.

666
00:44:28,748 --> 00:44:30,336
Speaker 1: oh Think of it this way.

667
00:44:30,416 --> 00:44:32,385
Speaker 1: y'all the the analogy I was about to use.

668
00:44:32,787 --> 00:44:33,330
Speaker 0: how does a work?

669
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:41,644
Speaker 1: I was gonna talk about CRT's, but those are also obsolete yeah, so It's a similar thing though, and that say you have a you know what it's like.

670
00:44:41,684 --> 00:44:56,969
Speaker 1: It's like the aspirin in a couch Sit in the couch for a long time data is just there, and then I get up There's a there's a really minuscule aspirin there so someone with a very high resolution camera could theoretically take a picture of that and

671
00:44:57,952 --> 00:44:58,915
Speaker 0: Figure out who's that.

672
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:00,761
Speaker 0: figure out they could recreate the ass.

673
00:45:00,902 --> 00:45:02,767
Speaker 1: yep, so think of it like that now.

674
00:45:02,848 --> 00:45:04,774
Speaker 0: in practice This is.

675
00:45:05,115 --> 00:45:08,025
Speaker 0: I've never actually seen a case actually of anyone actually doing that.

676
00:45:08,085 --> 00:45:18,270
Speaker 1: I read a recent paper Showing that it is actually way less feasible Than it used to be because of the density of data on modern magnetic drives.

677
00:45:18,430 --> 00:45:24,948
Speaker 1: Yeah, cuz like back when this was a more feasible attack hard drive had like 500 megabytes on it mm-hmm.

678
00:45:25,289 --> 00:45:26,736
Speaker 1: nowadays I mean I have.

679
00:45:26,957 --> 00:45:29,610
Speaker 1: I have five eight terabyte hard drive sitting up there.

680
00:45:31,550 --> 00:45:45,329
Speaker 1: So also file systems have changed a lot like things have changed so much since the last time I cared about this Mm-hmm that I actually have to do a little bit of research if I actually want to wipe out data on.

681
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,418
Speaker 0: a large D-band still works.

682
00:45:47,499 --> 00:45:48,142
Speaker 0: It's still out there.

683
00:45:48,283 --> 00:45:49,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still gonna get the job done.

684
00:45:50,153 --> 00:45:52,089
Speaker 1: I have not used it cuz I haven't actually given anyone.

685
00:45:52,431 --> 00:46:01,270
Speaker 0: Actually heard recently though that D band was like bought by a different company And then yeah There's a fork and then the fork is what you should be using cuz you don't want to pay this company that bought D band.

686
00:46:01,679 --> 00:46:02,005
Speaker 0: I don't know.

687
00:46:02,712 --> 00:46:04,963
Speaker 1: So I guess they give it this way when you on the high level.

688
00:46:04,983 --> 00:46:15,810
Speaker 1: and the reason I don't go deep again It's just that the details are so specific To circumstance nowadays, and I don't even know what the story is with different kinds of SS.

689
00:46:15,930 --> 00:46:18,920
Speaker 0: The point is this is only good for deleting a whole hard drive.

690
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,826
Speaker 0: usually you booting and nuking right.

691
00:46:20,906 --> 00:46:27,790
Speaker 0: what if say I'm on my computer And I've got you know some files and I committed some crimes?

692
00:46:27,930 --> 00:46:31,281
Speaker 0: But they're good crimes cuz I'm a revolutionary person.

693
00:46:31,301 --> 00:46:32,765
Speaker 1: Yeah, you're Robin Hood, right?

694
00:46:32,825 --> 00:46:35,829
Speaker 0: I'm a good person allow it I'm doing some anti-government work.

695
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:43,123
Speaker 0: That's actually but my government's evil and they're gonna come and take my computer And I can't have these files on the computer that they're about to that.

696
00:46:43,143 --> 00:46:45,612
Speaker 0: I know they're coming to take so already You're fucked.

697
00:46:45,713 --> 00:46:49,270
Speaker 1: and my argument is modern computers modern file systems.

698
00:46:50,098 --> 00:46:57,310
Speaker 1: there's a lot of collateral change and Circumstantial evidence that appears when you do anything on a computer.

699
00:46:57,832 --> 00:47:02,150
Speaker 1: There's time stamps and there's stuff the file system did all over the place.

700
00:47:02,592 --> 00:47:10,324
Speaker 1: It's pretty likely that no matter what you do to delete something that was previously there Someone could at least figure out that you deleted something.

701
00:47:10,585 --> 00:47:15,441
Speaker 1: Oh, no shit I think that you've although you've already like.

702
00:47:15,501 --> 00:47:24,730
Speaker 1: it's already too late if you're doing that kind of thing All the data that is ever involved in that thing should already be in a separate encrypted store somewhere.

703
00:47:24,911 --> 00:47:27,247
Speaker 0: All right, so I've got a separate encrypted USB stick.

704
00:47:27,408 --> 00:47:31,990
Speaker 1: Yep Okay, deleting the keys to out into decrypt it is the same as deleting the data.

705
00:47:33,831 --> 00:47:38,744
Speaker 1: Yeah, because look at how Modern bit locker style malware works.

706
00:47:38,965 --> 00:47:46,510
Speaker 1: It doesn't delete your files It encrypts them and if it doesn't if it doesn't give you the key to decrypt it the data is gone.

707
00:47:46,570 --> 00:47:47,775
Speaker 1: There's no way to get it back.

708
00:47:48,177 --> 00:47:48,278
Speaker 1: It's.

709
00:47:48,579 --> 00:47:49,684
Speaker 1: it might as well be deleted.

710
00:47:50,085 --> 00:47:51,009
Speaker 1: It's arguably better.

711
00:47:51,291 --> 00:47:53,279
Speaker 0: I mean, it's like this you go to someone's house.

712
00:47:53,762 --> 00:47:56,588
Speaker 0: You put it you replace the lock on their front door You can't get in the house.

713
00:47:56,775 --> 00:47:57,793
Speaker 0: Yeah But you can.

714
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,154
Speaker 0: you're out.

715
00:47:58,174 --> 00:48:03,875
Speaker 0: you can change the lock on their front door or you can actually install another door in front of their Front door that has a lock on it.

716
00:48:03,956 --> 00:48:07,670
Speaker 0: Yeah, and that lock is 100% unlockable without the key magic lock.

717
00:48:07,830 --> 00:48:09,215
Speaker 0: It's a perfect magic lock.

718
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:18,169
Speaker 0: and now you eat the key and you threaten to not poop it out Unless or dissolve it an acid or something unless they give you money.

719
00:48:18,953 --> 00:48:23,964
Speaker 0: So in the modern era like company and now no one can ever get in that house the end You have to smash the house.

720
00:48:24,571 --> 00:48:29,610
Speaker 1: Most companies have some sort of data retention policy and like rules for how they'll delete stuff.

721
00:48:30,337 --> 00:48:37,555
Speaker 1: It seems like a lot of people either don't pay that much attention to what they've documented or They don't worry about it that much.

722
00:48:37,575 --> 00:48:38,498
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm.

723
00:48:38,578 --> 00:49:02,189
Speaker 1: And I don't know how much of a concern it really is Because from what I've read the feasibility if you just delete files and Override a hard disk with zeros like do like a DD and just like write zeros over everything on a hard disk I don't know if it's actually feasible for anyone other than a government operator That's well-funded to even attempt to get that data back.

724
00:49:02,471 --> 00:49:07,004
Speaker 0: Yeah, and I don't know like an SSD like what really especially if that drive keeps getting used.

725
00:49:07,265 --> 00:49:14,630
Speaker 0: because thinking if you're doing you know Data retention operations that like a corporation what you're doing is getting rid of old customer data probably, right?

726
00:49:14,750 --> 00:49:26,989
Speaker 0: Yeah, you're only keeping it for a certain amount of time and then you're clearing it out, you know, it's like, okay We'll keep your track of your I don't know your all your transactions and all the things you bought Only for a year and then we'll get rid of them right something like that.

727
00:49:27,271 --> 00:49:35,730
Speaker 0: so that if anyone busts into our database and there's a leak which you know We're of course not gonna have a leak because we're not stupid like all that the other people had leaks like eco facts or whatever.

728
00:49:36,812 --> 00:49:45,550
Speaker 0: If there is one, you know, or if they say there's an internal accurate the company who's evil and starts poking around the database They'll only get the last year of data and not your full world history.

729
00:49:47,071 --> 00:49:50,261
Speaker 0: But you know what if you just clear delete those days.

730
00:49:50,361 --> 00:49:58,684
Speaker 0: if you just do like delete everything older than a year Those are the same hard drives in the same server All the new information is gonna just start filling in that space over time.

731
00:49:59,266 --> 00:50:00,633
Speaker 0: You're gonna be okay You can just.

732
00:50:00,653 --> 00:50:06,470
Speaker 1: probably I think what it comes down to is as much as this Feels like it should be a very technology focused episode.

733
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:18,730
Speaker 1: The reality is that unless you work at a company with a policy and some real reason to care It generally doesn't matter because as a consumer just run something like DBAN and then just give sell the hard drive.

734
00:50:18,770 --> 00:50:25,998
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean at that company with a data retention policy, you know a hard drive in the net the sand crashes or something Right or whatever.

735
00:50:26,018 --> 00:50:27,350
Speaker 0: they use their storage array.

736
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:33,856
Speaker 0: Yeah You take it out you put a new one in and then you make sure that before you put the old one in the garbage You do the DBAN equivalent.

737
00:50:33,936 --> 00:50:41,520
Speaker 1: So most of the companies I have talked to about this over the years Prefer physical destruction of those situations.

738
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:43,126
Speaker 0: perfectly fine as well.

739
00:50:43,186 --> 00:50:48,570
Speaker 1: drill press to the platters Which theoretically if it's just a drill press through the platters someone could pull the platters out.

740
00:50:48,590 --> 00:50:59,450
Speaker 0: Well, if it's a magnetic with but if you take an SSD and put a drill through it Yeah, unless you miss the persistent storage in there I think you open it up and you find the right spot and just like shoot it with a gun.

741
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:05,463
Speaker 0: Yeah Take you could actually just rip that one chip off and throw there, you know, but I guess the the.

742
00:51:05,724 --> 00:51:09,780
Speaker 1: it's not a technology question It's a procedures question.

743
00:51:10,061 --> 00:51:19,036
Speaker 1: if you need to delete data you need to do the research and come up with the risk-reward like ratios and procedures you could follow.

744
00:51:19,056 --> 00:51:21,506
Speaker 1: and the most important thing about deleting

745
00:51:21,526 --> 00:51:21,868
Speaker 0: data is

746
00:51:22,390 --> 00:51:36,259
Speaker 1: having an audit history of when and how you did you deleted the data so that if Someone recovers the data in some crazy way in the future You least have proof that you did what you said you did and that you Asserted that it was good enough at the time.

747
00:51:36,621 --> 00:51:38,430
Speaker 0: It's a lot like, you know paper shredding, right?

748
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:45,460
Speaker 0: It's like yeah, you just buy a paper shredder it, you know, all of us deep over whatever your staples Yeah, or Amazon and put a piece of paper in there.

749
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:48,231
Speaker 0: a lot of crazy nuts are like, oh my god It.

750
00:51:48,372 --> 00:51:54,330
Speaker 0: those cut the paper in a certain pattern and and the government's know how to put together get a cross shredder.

751
00:51:54,430 --> 00:52:01,409
Speaker 1: Yeah, if it if the piece of paper is like the names of your spies in North Korea Yeah, maybe you should use a cross shredder and then burn it.

752
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:10,978
Speaker 1: but if it's my bank account statement the regular shredder I got from Amazon for the regular shredders and the raw chicken that it's in the Garbage with is probably sufficient.

753
00:52:11,279 --> 00:52:12,665
Speaker 0: My shredder has its own trash bin.

754
00:52:12,786 --> 00:52:14,613
Speaker 0: It's like its own Thing.

755
00:52:14,653 --> 00:52:15,436
Speaker 0: it doesn't mix with the.

756
00:52:15,957 --> 00:52:18,044
Speaker 1: oh, yeah, but I would just dump it in with the kitchen stuff.

757
00:52:18,606 --> 00:52:19,709
Speaker 1: Okay, why not?

758
00:52:20,111 --> 00:52:20,554
Speaker 0: Stick it up.

759
00:52:20,976 --> 00:52:23,350
Speaker 0: Yeah help take it up help ward people away.

760
00:52:24,331 --> 00:52:26,920
Speaker 1: I don't think anyone's digging through like cat litter.

761
00:52:26,940 --> 00:52:28,968
Speaker 1: No figure out a bank statement for me.

762
00:52:28,988 --> 00:52:32,982
Speaker 0: No So, yeah, but yeah, I like big companies.

763
00:52:33,002 --> 00:52:35,792
Speaker 0: what they do is they usually get the Visiting shredder.

764
00:52:35,812 --> 00:52:42,736
Speaker 0: Yeah big day put all their shredding stuff in these bins with locks on them like padlocks that could easily be busted because it's a plastic bin.

765
00:52:43,118 --> 00:53:01,527
Speaker 0: and then once a week or so the plastic bins go downstairs and there's Tractor trailer with an enormous shredder of industrial nature in it and it dumps out the bins into the shredder There's in such a way that even the shredding guys who are driving the truck can't even see what's in there and it shreds that Shit like oh, baby big time.

766
00:53:01,548 --> 00:53:10,396
Speaker 1: now I get the impression that a lot of the stories of someone got a hard drive and got data off of it are Literally just thought nothing was even done.

767
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:18,678
Speaker 1: like the hard drive just stopped working and someone threw it away and didn't even try to Even get a shredder to put the hard drives in.

768
00:53:18,738 --> 00:53:20,667
Speaker 0: I'm sure a big real big one.

769
00:53:20,687 --> 00:53:25,490
Speaker 1: I have That kind of shredder before they are terrifying to be around.

770
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:30,142
Speaker 0: Don't put any human flesh or any flesh period and anywhere near the entrance hole.

771
00:53:30,163 --> 00:53:36,652
Speaker 0: Yeah use a long stick to drop the hard drive Grabbers.

772
00:53:36,853 --> 00:53:51,981
Speaker 1: what this comes down to is if you just do basic due diligence to delete data from hard drives before you give them to people and If you can't do basic due diligence Destroy the hard drive rather than give it to anyone.

773
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:54,290
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm, and that's probably enough.

774
00:53:55,056 --> 00:54:02,669
Speaker 1: And if you can't even do that Then all the data on your hard drive is probably still there and easy for anyone who gets that hard drive to get.

775
00:54:02,809 --> 00:54:07,970
Speaker 0: if they Wanted to yeah, or maybe they'll just install Windows and treat it like a clean hard drive and they won't ever look at it.

776
00:54:09,893 --> 00:54:14,034
Speaker 0: So now we'll talk about not so much deleting but rim wanted to talk about Unpublishing right.

777
00:54:14,054 --> 00:54:15,819
Speaker 0: So the first obviously we talk about unpublishing.

778
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:18,930
Speaker 0: It's because you can't it's not possible to do this.

779
00:54:19,150 --> 00:54:21,377
Speaker 0: Yep, right as soon as you have some bits.

780
00:54:21,999 --> 00:54:25,730
Speaker 0: if you send those bits out onto the internet somewhere, right?

781
00:54:26,073 --> 00:54:26,567
Speaker 0: Guess what?

782
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:29,426
Speaker 0: You might as well just broadcast them the whole world.

783
00:54:29,466 --> 00:54:29,909
Speaker 0: deal with it.

784
00:54:30,030 --> 00:54:33,244
Speaker 1: So case in point my crazy archive of like everything.

785
00:54:33,707 --> 00:54:35,031
Speaker 1: it's on my NAS Mm-hmm.

786
00:54:35,432 --> 00:54:38,501
Speaker 1: And as a result, it is also mirrored onto Amazon Glacier.

787
00:54:38,521 --> 00:54:41,890
Speaker 1: Okay, but it's not published because it's encrypted up there.

788
00:54:42,733 --> 00:54:45,263
Speaker 0: So yeah, it was encrypted before it was sent there.

789
00:54:45,484 --> 00:54:46,930
Speaker 0: Yeah, and it's sitting there encrypted.

790
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:51,064
Speaker 0: So yeah, someone could get those encrypted bits, but because the keys are here.

791
00:54:51,084 --> 00:55:00,369
Speaker 0: It's not actually published You don't need to unpublish it because if so, even as Amazon people open up Glacier and get the files out Yep They got a bunch of random nonsense.

792
00:55:00,591 --> 00:55:00,912
Speaker 1: mostly.

793
00:55:00,932 --> 00:55:08,309
Speaker 1: what this comes down to is the thorny question of if you have data on a service and You want to stop using that service?

794
00:55:08,771 --> 00:55:12,704
Speaker 1: How do you know they actually remove your data if they even do you have to trust them?

795
00:55:12,985 --> 00:55:14,630
Speaker 0: Yep, there's no way.

796
00:55:14,831 --> 00:55:16,376
Speaker 0: Cloud is someone else's computer.

797
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:19,065
Speaker 0: So it's I have my private photos and someone else's computer.

798
00:55:19,346 --> 00:55:20,470
Speaker 0: I asked them to delete them.

799
00:55:20,551 --> 00:55:23,012
Speaker 0: They say they did The end.

800
00:55:23,313 --> 00:55:26,303
Speaker 1: yep, and you might say oh, but what about things like snapchat?

801
00:55:26,383 --> 00:55:28,510
Speaker 1: that the you you have to trust them.

802
00:55:29,411 --> 00:55:29,733
Speaker 1: That's it.

803
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:30,195
Speaker 1: You still have.

804
00:55:30,236 --> 00:55:32,045
Speaker 0: you're just going on their word.

805
00:55:32,226 --> 00:55:32,990
Speaker 1: You look at the code.

806
00:55:33,070 --> 00:55:34,902
Speaker 1: You know what they're doing unless you got.

807
00:55:35,223 --> 00:55:40,381
Speaker 0: even if you see the code How do you know that's the code that's running on their server, yep They could have just shown you some other code.

808
00:55:40,421 --> 00:55:42,655
Speaker 1: look at Facebook and Cambridge Analytica and all.

809
00:55:42,695 --> 00:55:45,730
Speaker 0: they let you come into their office and look at their server and examine it.

810
00:55:46,352 --> 00:55:47,135
Speaker 0: How do you know that?

811
00:55:47,176 --> 00:55:48,802
Speaker 0: that's the server that's actually being used?

812
00:55:48,863 --> 00:55:49,987
Speaker 0: It's not some phony setup.

813
00:55:50,007 --> 00:55:50,893
Speaker 1: Well, look at geek nights Like.

814
00:55:50,933 --> 00:55:55,367
Speaker 1: we won't even remove Comments in the old forum that is archived forever.

815
00:55:55,387 --> 00:56:08,230
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm if you post it in there like tough nuts, you know, if you really had like I guess if someone came to us with like a Serious problem like being stalked by something we might go back into that database and like change the name on an account.

816
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:10,970
Speaker 0: I mean people would could change their own names and on their accounts.

817
00:56:11,513 --> 00:56:14,328
Speaker 0: So like people had done that where I was like, no, I'm not deleting anything.

818
00:56:14,348 --> 00:56:18,010
Speaker 0: Sorry I want to help you but you know, that's not a way that I can help you.

819
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:26,259
Speaker 0: They just changed their username to make it so that anyone searching for their old name wouldn't find them And they close their account and stop posting.

820
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:32,942
Speaker 1: It's like if I delete my Flickr account, let's say Should Flickr be legally obligated to delete all my shit.

821
00:56:33,123 --> 00:56:39,703
Speaker 0: I mean if we're in charge of writing the law Mmm, it depends cuz at the same time running a forum.

822
00:56:40,044 --> 00:56:41,368
Speaker 1: I don't want to delete cool data.

823
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:45,586
Speaker 0: No Right someone took a cool photo in your Flickr, right?

824
00:56:45,707 --> 00:56:46,048
Speaker 0: It's like.

825
00:56:46,068 --> 00:56:52,548
Speaker 0: well You know, I kind of don't want to delete that photo right the whole world should be able to experience that photo.

826
00:56:52,608 --> 00:56:53,270
Speaker 0: It's so awesome.

827
00:56:53,651 --> 00:56:59,010
Speaker 0: I like person who previously had already shared it with the world now wants to unshare it with the world.

828
00:56:59,110 --> 00:57:02,360
Speaker 1: I like the idea of a new class of copyright.

829
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:03,363
Speaker 1: I just thought of this now.

830
00:57:03,644 --> 00:57:03,864
Speaker 0: Uh-huh.

831
00:57:04,225 --> 00:57:04,586
Speaker 0: Okay.

832
00:57:04,827 --> 00:57:06,728
Speaker 0: I'm sure it's a great idea You just thought of now.

833
00:57:06,930 --> 00:57:09,859
Speaker 1: So here's my basic idea because this is kind of like something like.

834
00:57:09,879 --> 00:57:11,163
Speaker 1: so I want to.

835
00:57:11,244 --> 00:57:16,091
Speaker 1: when I die and this is in my Will but I want I get updated because it's Mr.

836
00:57:16,131 --> 00:57:19,646
Speaker 1: Willow basically a public domain is mine to all my email account everything.

837
00:57:19,706 --> 00:57:20,008
Speaker 1: Fuck it.

838
00:57:20,028 --> 00:57:20,449
Speaker 1: Here you go.

839
00:57:20,671 --> 00:57:23,350
Speaker 1: Yeah, the world can read every email remember sent.

840
00:57:23,410 --> 00:57:32,250
Speaker 0: Well, I mean I got like, you know instructions like here is how to get into every one of my accounts and get all my Stuffs and you know because someone might need to my emails to manage my stuff when I'm dead.

841
00:57:32,671 --> 00:57:38,093
Speaker 1: I like the idea of there being a class of copyright law Above and beyond.

842
00:57:38,133 --> 00:57:43,228
Speaker 1: public domain may be called like the public trust or something or the public time trial.

843
00:57:43,248 --> 00:57:44,030
Speaker 0: things probably exist.

844
00:57:44,243 --> 00:57:47,323
Speaker 1: No But imagine so I there's would have to be a government run service.

845
00:57:47,383 --> 00:57:48,910
Speaker 1: can't trust some tech startup to do this.

846
00:57:49,010 --> 00:57:50,739
Speaker 0: Send it the Internet archive say archive.

847
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:50,940
Speaker 0: No.

848
00:57:50,980 --> 00:58:05,266
Speaker 1: No, I want the ability to Basically send data to a government service that is encrypted and unlocks Something like some number of years after your death and there's laws protecting it.

849
00:58:05,567 --> 00:58:07,909
Speaker 1: so you could say Here is data.

850
00:58:08,612 --> 00:58:13,566
Speaker 0: Why don't we start that service and then not actually unlock anything because the dead people can't sue?

851
00:58:14,268 --> 00:58:15,050
Speaker 1: that's not a bad idea.

852
00:58:15,050 --> 00:58:16,885
Speaker 1: That's like saying selling rapture insurance.

853
00:58:17,228 --> 00:58:27,030
Speaker 1: Yes Yeah, but I do like the idea of like services that get users data being obligated to unpublish it At least from the things they control if someone quits their service.

854
00:58:27,351 --> 00:58:34,290
Speaker 1: But I also like the idea that like 50 years after that person's death that data is out again.

855
00:58:34,491 --> 00:58:42,039
Speaker 1: Like get past the point where it's going likely to harm people and have a way To put data into the public trust on a time-delayed fashion.

856
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:53,290
Speaker 0: Hmm If someone posts a cool YouTube video and it's cool It's worth seeing and then they decide that they want to delete it from the internet.

857
00:58:53,632 --> 00:58:55,669
Speaker 0: Like there's that guy who deleted all this code from the internet.

858
00:58:56,653 --> 00:58:58,280
Speaker 0: You know, I've been a few guys like that.

859
00:58:59,003 --> 00:58:59,364
Speaker 0: Guess what?

860
00:58:59,444 --> 00:58:59,866
Speaker 0: It's out there.

861
00:58:59,886 --> 00:59:00,448
Speaker 0: Everyone's got it.

862
00:59:00,468 --> 00:59:03,519
Speaker 1: It's too late Yeah, but how do you know what we it was worth?

863
00:59:03,539 --> 00:59:06,710
Speaker 1: We've never been able to find that fuck his head thing.

864
00:59:08,491 --> 00:59:09,015
Speaker 0: Remember that?

865
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:09,941
Speaker 0: why didn't you save it?

866
00:59:11,791 --> 00:59:13,641
Speaker 1: Because it was some flash thing and I didn't save.

867
00:59:13,781 --> 00:59:15,389
Speaker 0: why didn't you save the eight people going gaga?

868
00:59:16,271 --> 00:59:19,505
Speaker 1: I do have that on a hard drive that's dead and I'd have to pay someone.

869
00:59:19,525 --> 00:59:20,409
Speaker 0: Why didn't you back up?

870
00:59:21,610 --> 00:59:24,523
Speaker 1: Uh, because that was a time when I didn't have any money different time.

871
00:59:24,543 --> 00:59:24,985
Speaker 0: You understand.

872
00:59:25,045 --> 00:59:31,307
Speaker 1: That's a bad hard drive Only holds a gigabyte one whole gigabyte gigabyte.

873
00:59:31,388 --> 00:59:31,789
Speaker 0: Whoa.

874
00:59:33,091 --> 00:59:37,650
Speaker 1: And actually almost everything else from that hard drive was backed up except for the most important file.

875
00:59:37,911 --> 00:59:40,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, we don't have Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.

876
00:59:41,103 --> 00:59:41,524
Speaker 0: You need it.

877
00:59:41,745 --> 00:59:42,407
Speaker 1: I can't find it.

878
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:44,878
Speaker 1: Good luck I found a similar but different video.

879
00:59:44,899 --> 00:59:47,270
Speaker 1: I'm just saying there are things I remember that are gone.

880
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:48,895
Speaker 0: There are things that are good to be gone.

881
00:59:49,256 --> 00:59:53,290
Speaker 0: I said, I usually I think it's immoral to delete data, but not all day.

882
00:59:55,817 --> 00:59:57,048
Speaker 1: The other day there's a there's the.

883
00:59:57,832 --> 01:00:01,890
Speaker 1: We're talking this morning - there's the I. how do you delete something from your own brain?

884
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,455

01:00:15,930 --> 01:00:16,793
Speaker 1: You'll not be named.

888
01:00:17,215 --> 01:00:21,410
Speaker 1: in the hopes that we would all eventually actually forget this person's name.

889
01:00:21,510 --> 01:00:27,336
Speaker 0: I thought we were just saying he who shall not be named because a it was funny and be used to Remind you how gross the first.

890
01:00:27,356 --> 01:00:29,464
Speaker 1: but I legit wanted to forget his name.

Speaker 0: I can spot him on the street.

898
01:00:44,065 --> 01:00:52,289
Speaker 1: I Vaguely remember what he looks like but I've morphed him with another person who I do remember their name a little bit because they had similar physical attributes.

01:00:52,511 --> 01:00:53,674
Speaker 1: Mm-hmm that person.

Speaker 1: so think of this.

917
01:01:43,000 --> 01:02:03,508
Speaker 1: your brain is a lot like these hard drives where You think something is deleted, but actually you just deleted the pointer to it Mm-hmm, but if anything else in your brain points at it something you haven't thought about in a long time You'll smell a weird smell and suddenly your brains like oh, that's what that guy's name was Because you smelled him one day and your brain remembered that pointer.

918
01:02:03,528 --> 01:02:05,573
