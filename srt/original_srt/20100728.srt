1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:10,715
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday July 28th.

2
00:00:10,936 --> 00:00:11,457
Speaker 1: I'm Rem.

3
00:00:11,718 --> 00:00:12,881
Speaker 0: I'm Scott.

4
00:00:13,022 --> 00:00:15,689
Speaker 1: And this is Geek Nights tonight, a-durrrrrrrrr.

5
00:00:17,531 --> 00:00:20,073
Speaker 0: We gotta redo that.

6
00:00:20,093 --> 00:00:21,314
Speaker 1: Dur-a-ra.

7
00:00:23,175 --> 00:00:24,256
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

8
00:00:27,358 --> 00:00:28,919
Speaker 0: So, durr, that's durr.

9
00:00:28,959 --> 00:00:31,346
Speaker 0: I guess that's the noise Rem makes most of the time.

10
00:00:31,366 --> 00:00:37,590
Speaker 1: See, I realize the reason that is a bad way to introduce this show is that we could be talking about Rosa Versailles.

11
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:39,637
Speaker 0: No, that's durr.

12
00:00:39,757 --> 00:00:41,604
Speaker 1: Well, that's if the P is silent.

13
00:00:41,845 --> 00:00:43,129
Speaker 0: Der is just rim.

14
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:46,602
Speaker 1: Well there's der, there's derp to der and there's derp to derp to der.

15
00:00:46,983 --> 00:00:47,926
Speaker 0: No, those are all you.

16
00:00:49,491 --> 00:00:50,756
Speaker 1: So we'll get into this.

17
00:00:50,796 --> 00:00:56,154
Speaker 1: You know, Otikons this weekend, we have news from the Comic-Con, but taking a cab home last night, right?

18
00:00:56,334 --> 00:00:56,675
Speaker 0: Okay.

19
00:00:57,097 --> 00:01:01,149
Speaker 1: And I was talking to the cabbie and he owns his medallion.

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,272
Speaker 1: Really?

21
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:04,658
Speaker 1: He bought it like 20 years ago.

22
00:01:04,678 --> 00:01:05,160
Speaker 0: Wait, wait, wait.

23
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,780
Speaker 0: So why, how did, how did you get to the point where he was actually telling you about this?

24
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:13,988
Speaker 1: I was sitting in the front seat with him and he was like, "Hey, I'll drive you, but my credit card machine's not working.

25
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,597
Speaker 1: I cannot take credit cards.

26
00:01:16,858 --> 00:01:20,532
Speaker 1: I will get in serious trouble if you want to pay with a credit card and you

27
00:01:20,572 --> 00:01:20,914
Speaker 1: can't.".

28
00:01:21,978 --> 00:01:22,901
Speaker 1: And we were like, "Well, we got it.

29
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:23,082
Speaker 1: We got

30
00:01:23,103 --> 00:01:23,384
Speaker 1: cash.".

31
00:01:23,988 --> 00:01:24,812
Speaker 1: And he was totally cool.

32
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:27,186
Speaker 1: We were talking about the city and then he's telling, you know, he lives in Queens.

33
00:01:27,226 --> 00:01:29,197
Speaker 1: He's like, "I've lived in Queens for like 40 years.

34
00:01:29,539 --> 00:01:30,363
Speaker 1: It's the best place in the world.

35
00:01:30,383 --> 00:01:31,247
Speaker 1: It's cool everywhere else.

36
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:32,734
Speaker 1: Don't ever live anywhere

37
00:01:32,794 --> 00:01:32,975
Speaker 1: else.".

38
00:01:33,718 --> 00:01:36,490
Speaker 1: And yeah, apparently 20 years ago for like 50 grand, he got a loan.

39
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,120
Speaker 1: He bought a yellow cab medallion.

40
00:01:39,181 --> 00:01:40,159
Speaker 0: So it's worth it, I guess.

41
00:01:40,401 --> 00:01:40,703
Speaker 1: Yes.

42
00:01:41,066 --> 00:01:42,760
Speaker 1: He said, yeah, he lives comfortably.

43
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:46,160
Speaker 0: How much money can you make in one day with a cab though?

44
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:48,153
Speaker 1: Well, it took him like 20 minutes to drive us home.

45
00:01:48,173 --> 00:01:49,685
Speaker 1: It was like 20 bucks total.

46
00:01:49,746 --> 00:01:51,120
Speaker 1: So about a dollar a minute.

47
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,343
Speaker 0: Dollar a minute.

48
00:01:52,785 --> 00:01:57,406
Speaker 0: So that's eight hours of driving, assuming you do eight hours, times 60 minutes.

49
00:01:57,426 --> 00:01:58,290
Speaker 0: So $4,800 a day.

50
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:02,398
Speaker 1: Not bad.

51
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,441
Speaker 0: Damn.

52
00:02:03,541 --> 00:02:04,647
Speaker 0: Why the hell am I doing this?

53
00:02:04,667 --> 00:02:05,571
Speaker 0: There's more behind me.

54
00:02:05,631 --> 00:02:06,395
Speaker 0: I don't make $4,800 in a week.

55
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,579
Speaker 1: Because a medallion costs one to $4 million.

56
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:11,442
Speaker 0: Okay.

57
00:02:11,462 --> 00:02:15,379
Speaker 0: So if I pay one to $4 million, how long would it take to pay it off?

58
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:18,012
Speaker 1: Remember interest, because you have to borrow that money.

59
00:02:18,032 --> 00:02:19,280
Speaker 1: You don't have one to $4 million.

60
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:20,102
Speaker 0: Of course.

61
00:02:20,163 --> 00:02:20,546
Speaker 0: Of course.

62
00:02:20,566 --> 00:02:21,879
Speaker 0: I had to do some maths.

63
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:24,039
Speaker 0: Regardless, it's a lot of driving.

64
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:25,239
Speaker 1: It was pretty cool.

65
00:02:25,421 --> 00:02:27,839
Speaker 0: If he's driving for 40 years, good deal.

66
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,280
Speaker 1: So we realized we haven't done a Monday show and for fuck ever.

67
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,570
Speaker 0: And we're not doing a Monday show right now either.

68
00:02:33,832 --> 00:02:35,340
Speaker 0: It's a Wednesday show.

69
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,100
Speaker 1: We got an epic Monday show coming.

70
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,360
Speaker 0: We haven't done a Wednesday show and forever.

71
00:02:39,981 --> 00:02:42,660
Speaker 0: So we haven't done a Monday show and fuck ever.

72
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:43,383
Speaker 1: So we're back.

73
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:44,006
Speaker 1: It's Wednesday.

74
00:02:44,026 --> 00:02:45,313
Speaker 1: And you know what?

75
00:02:45,534 --> 00:02:48,980
Speaker 1: There's actually for once news in the animation industry.

76
00:02:49,381 --> 00:02:54,959
Speaker 0: Well, also in the comics and everything else, because everyone saves all their announcements for Comic Con.

77
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:57,680
Speaker 0: I really, you know, some other people are saying the same thing.

78
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,184
Speaker 0: Why?

79
00:02:58,568 --> 00:02:59,820
Speaker 0: Why do you save your announcement?

80
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:01,030
Speaker 0: Like, what's the point?

81
00:03:01,252 --> 00:03:01,797
Speaker 0: Like, I don't get it.

82
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,222
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

83
00:03:03,845 --> 00:03:12,140
Speaker 1: Some industries you want to announce when other people are not announcing unless your announcement is big enough to where people will forget about everybody else.

84
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,940
Speaker 0: I mean, the problem is, right, is Comic Con is mostly movie shit nowadays, right?

85
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:21,860
Speaker 0: And people are actually saying maybe we should split it into, you know, movie con and Comic Con, you know, because it's getting all over each other.

86
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:29,500
Speaker 0: But anyway, regardless, if some guy's announcing like, oh, shit, we're going to make a movie about the superhero, that's going to be all over the news.

87
00:03:29,661 --> 00:03:35,935
Speaker 0: And your announcement of my new comic is coming out or, you know, is not going to be heard by anybody is right.

88
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,929
Speaker 0: So you should just announce things.

89
00:03:38,949 --> 00:03:43,535
Speaker 0: as you know, when you have confirmed something like, ah, we have decided we will do this.

90
00:03:43,676 --> 00:03:44,240
Speaker 0: It is a lock.

91
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,824
Speaker 0: We're doing it.

92
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:46,619
Speaker 0: Announce it right then.

93
00:03:47,322 --> 00:03:48,126
Speaker 0: How about that day?

94
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:50,339
Speaker 0: The day after the next convenient day?

95
00:03:50,781 --> 00:03:55,980
Speaker 0: You know, hold on to it until Comic Con, you know, and then put it out there.

96
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,900
Speaker 0: And now it's lost in this big sea of people going.

97
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,599
Speaker 1: But it could also be a kind of gentleman's agreement in the industry of we'll all announce our stuff at this event where it is traditional to do so.

98
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:08,599
Speaker 1: Perhaps people who run conventions like this.

99
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,520
Speaker 0: What is the benefit of choosing Apple in that situation?

100
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:12,818
Speaker 1: Perhaps.

101
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:21,659
Speaker 1: Remember, in the real world, unlike in just the prisoner's dilemma, you only really choose Apple when someone is bribing you with several additional apples.

102
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,440
Speaker 0: So where are these additional apples?

103
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:24,044
Speaker 1: I don't know.

104
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:25,120
Speaker 1: Maybe the comic industry.

105
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:25,723
Speaker 1: I mean, I don't know.

106
00:04:25,803 --> 00:04:32,254
Speaker 1: I just your dismissal of the practice of the industry, while usually warranted, I can force.

107
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:36,420
Speaker 1: I can see reasons why people might delay announcements or wait or give me a reason.

108
00:04:37,325 --> 00:04:37,590
Speaker 1: All right.

109
00:04:37,631 --> 00:04:38,099
Speaker 1: They want it.

110
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:41,580
Speaker 1: They know that press will be there paying attention at Comic Con.

111
00:04:41,842 --> 00:04:44,117
Speaker 1: If they announce it another time, no one gives a shit.

112
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:45,697
Speaker 1: No one even notices.

113
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:50,680
Speaker 0: Well, I mean, you know, if it's if it's a news about something that is not a movie.

114
00:04:50,922 --> 00:04:51,165
Speaker 0: Right.

115
00:04:51,205 --> 00:04:52,780
Speaker 0: Those press aren't paying attention anyway.

116
00:04:53,302 --> 00:04:53,544
Speaker 0: Right.

117
00:04:53,584 --> 00:04:55,740
Speaker 1: But at Comic Con, there is press that cares.

118
00:04:56,481 --> 00:05:01,020
Speaker 0: But if it is a comic or anime news, they're not going to pay attention anyway.

119
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:12,560
Speaker 0: The only people that are going to pay attention are things like Anime News Network or Newsarama or any of the kind of news that you're thinking only of the above the radar fans, the below the radar people.

120
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:15,859
Speaker 1: They probably barely know that Comic Con exists.

121
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,640
Speaker 1: And then right after Comic Con, there's all this news.

122
00:05:18,781 --> 00:05:21,340
Speaker 1: And they suddenly start like looking at articles and seeing stuff.

123
00:05:21,782 --> 00:05:23,259
Speaker 1: And the rest of the year, they never even look.

124
00:05:23,682 --> 00:05:24,719
Speaker 1: So the news is all at once.

125
00:05:25,122 --> 00:05:27,160
Speaker 1: And then as a result, the nerds find out all at once.

126
00:05:27,261 --> 00:05:28,778
Speaker 1: These people would otherwise never find out.

127
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,706
Speaker 0: Maybe there's a chance.

128
00:05:30,726 --> 00:05:37,120
Speaker 0: there's a chance that the normal under the radar fan could go to the nerdy websites all the reason soon after the comic.

129
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,419
Speaker 1: It doesn't matter either way.

130
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:43,960
Speaker 1: And you just pick that date because that's a nice date to kind of plan to do all your announcements and it's a nice tradition.

131
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:47,499
Speaker 1: And you're not under any pressure because you're in an industry with very long cycles.

132
00:05:49,622 --> 00:05:52,780
Speaker 1: Well, of course, there was actually very important news from the Comic Con.

133
00:05:53,461 --> 00:05:56,859
Speaker 1: I mean, that guy got stabbed to death, I heard in Hall H.

134
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:57,679
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

135
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:00,078
Speaker 0: Well, Hall H, you know, H stands for hell.

136
00:06:02,283 --> 00:06:03,860
Speaker 1: Hall H is like the worst.

137
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:09,360
Speaker 1: It's everything that I would hate about going to the Comic Con condensed into one hall.

138
00:06:09,481 --> 00:06:13,280
Speaker 0: Thing is, people talk about going to Comic Con and waiting in lines and waiting in lines.

139
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:17,680
Speaker 0: It's like, dude, I mean, if you don't go to the Hall H, are you really waiting in any lines?

140
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:22,330
Speaker 0: Just don't go to see any of that shit with the famous people and you won't have to wait in a line.

141
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,759
Speaker 1: I'm looking at pictures of the Comic Con and it's just like you think that hallway in the middle of Otacon is bad.

142
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:28,486
Speaker 1: Imagine that times 10.

143
00:06:28,486 --> 00:06:29,239
Speaker 1: It's like you can walk.

144
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:33,060
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've seen pictures of the dealer's room and you can't really walk very much at all.

145
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:39,100
Speaker 0: But even so, it's like, OK, you can't really walk that much in the dealer's room, but you can still, you know, cover it.

146
00:06:39,242 --> 00:06:40,240
Speaker 0: You don't have to wait in a line.

147
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:40,500
Speaker 0: You can.

148
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:49,850
Speaker 1: just Hall H is basically the room where, like, oh, shit, the trailer to the new Twilight movie is going to be shown at 141.

149
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:50,039
Speaker 0: Yep.

150
00:06:50,804 --> 00:06:51,458
Speaker 1: And then that's it.

151
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:52,720
Speaker 1: And little things like that.

152
00:06:52,861 --> 00:06:55,979
Speaker 1: And the hardcore crazy fan just bust their way in.

153
00:06:56,525 --> 00:06:57,198
Speaker 1: Never leave.

154
00:06:59,182 --> 00:07:03,980
Speaker 1: Unless I can have some sort of bodyguard entourage bubble, I don't think I ever want to enter that hall.

155
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:10,060
Speaker 0: Like what could possibly be in Hall H that would be worth in or in any hall that would be worth waiting in that ridiculous.

156
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:13,200
Speaker 1: I mean, you're basically about free kisses from Patrick Stewart.

157
00:07:13,642 --> 00:07:13,956
Speaker 0: Big deal.

158
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:20,740
Speaker 0: So I mean, like angry video game nerd, he was talking and like he went to see Penn and Teller and he had waited in line for that.

159
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,960
Speaker 0: But I don't think it was Hall H. I think it was some other hall.

160
00:07:23,122 --> 00:07:24,500
Speaker 0: You know, the line wasn't that crazy.

161
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,299
Speaker 1: It's a much better idea.

162
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:26,454
Speaker 0: And he did get in.

163
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,379
Speaker 1: We could have a Dagen H instead.

164
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,118
Speaker 0: Oh, Dagen H. That's such an excellent H. You know what?

165
00:07:31,421 --> 00:07:33,618
Speaker 0: I think Comic-Con needs its own Dagen H.

166
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:34,860
Speaker 1: As does Otacon.

167
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:35,335
Speaker 1: Huh?

168
00:07:35,484 --> 00:07:35,571
Speaker 1: Yeah.

169
00:07:35,981 --> 00:07:38,260
Speaker 0: I mean, imagine if you're waiting in the Otacon line.

170
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:40,000
Speaker 0: The line to get your reg badge.

171
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,000
Speaker 0: But that's not the line to get the badge.

172
00:07:42,561 --> 00:07:43,959
Speaker 0: That's because the badge was mailed to you.

173
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,320
Speaker 0: Because this is Comic-Con International.

174
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,620
Speaker 0: They mail the badge, right?

175
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,379
Speaker 1: But then you get...

176
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,720
Speaker 0: You have to wait in that line for every panel.

177
00:07:50,701 --> 00:07:52,179
Speaker 0: That's what Comic-Con is.

178
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,580
Speaker 0: You're waiting in the line to get into Otacon.

179
00:07:55,202 --> 00:07:57,259
Speaker 0: You get your badge, but you're doing that multiple times.

180
00:07:57,941 --> 00:07:59,720
Speaker 1: I don't know how people deal with it.

181
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,200
Speaker 1: But look at these pictures.

182
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:04,460
Speaker 1: Every single person is smiling, except in one picture I'm looking at.

183
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:07,240
Speaker 1: There's this really fat guy who looks really hot and uncomfortable.

184
00:08:07,784 --> 00:08:09,860
Speaker 1: And someone is trying to, like, shove their way around him.

185
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:11,000
Speaker 1: And he does not look happy.

186
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,239
Speaker 0: All right, well, let's talk about the stabbing.

187
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,879
Speaker 1: So, basically, here are the details...

188
00:08:15,921 --> 00:08:16,258
Speaker 0: Stabbing.

189
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:22,180
Speaker 1: So, the details that are relevant are that, one, the nerd media jumped all over this and lost its shit.

190
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:22,899
Speaker 1: Oh, my God.

191
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:24,199
Speaker 1: It finally happened.

192
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,520
Speaker 1: You know, violence at a nerd convention.

193
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,540
Speaker 1: Someone got stabbed.

194
00:08:27,921 --> 00:08:29,980
Speaker 0: Yeah, dude, you should check out Akihabara.

195
00:08:30,364 --> 00:08:31,000
Speaker 0: They've got you beat.

196
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,639
Speaker 1: So, here's what actually happened.

197
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:43,107
Speaker 0: Ow.

198
00:08:43,942 --> 00:08:44,358
Speaker 0: Dang it.

199
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:44,960
Speaker 0: Ow.

200
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:55,100
Speaker 1: And it is the tiny details that make this wonderful.

201
00:08:55,320 --> 00:09:00,380
Speaker 1: Like, for example, what panel it was that these two nerds were trying to see and what they were wearing.

202
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,320
Speaker 0: Wasn't it the Resident Evil movie thing?

203
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,080
Speaker 1: Yes, Resident Evil.

204
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:05,340
Speaker 0: We saw the big cardboard setup for that at the movie theater.

205
00:09:05,702 --> 00:09:06,720
Speaker 0: It looked pretty terrible.

206
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,019
Speaker 0: Had a panel.

207
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:09,337
Speaker 0: All right, so that was in Hall H, right?

208
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:10,340
Speaker 1: That was in Hall H.

209
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,019
Speaker 0: Why would you wait in that insane line to see that?

210
00:09:13,481 --> 00:09:14,759
Speaker 0: What person is this?

211
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,140
Speaker 1: They were already in the panel.

212
00:09:16,361 --> 00:09:17,836
Speaker 1: In fact, the panel was almost over.

213
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:18,484
Speaker 0: Okay.

214
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,160
Speaker 1: So, near the end of the...

215
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,499
Speaker 0: But, I mean, why would anyone wait?

216
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:22,368
Speaker 0: Why was that in Hall H?

217
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:27,560
Speaker 0: Why are there that many... Hall H, I assume, holds thousands, right?

218
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,119
Speaker 1: Scott, the room was filled for this.

219
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:33,280
Speaker 0: So, there were thousands of people there to see the Resident Evil movie something?

220
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,629
Speaker 1: Scott, remember when we went to see Inception?

221
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,700
Speaker 1: And there was that crazy line to get into the theater.

222
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,115
Speaker 1: We're like, "Crap, we're not going to get a

223
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:42,337
Speaker 1: seat.".

224
00:09:42,701 --> 00:09:44,415
Speaker 1: And then the theater's like, "No, that's the line for

225
00:09:44,456 --> 00:09:44,698
Speaker 1: Salt.".

226
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,018
Speaker 1: Walked right in for Inception.

227
00:09:46,322 --> 00:09:46,800
Speaker 0: What the hell was Salt?

228
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:47,677
Speaker 0: I don't even know.

229
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:49,460
Speaker 1: Angelina Jolie's spy movie.

230
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,439
Speaker 1: It actually looks pretty good.

231
00:09:51,043 --> 00:09:53,780
Speaker 0: But, why would you wait in the line for that?

232
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:57,159
Speaker 1: Your strangely righteous indignation surprises me.

233
00:09:58,142 --> 00:09:59,914
Speaker 1: I mean, I would wait in that line for free gold.

234
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:01,980
Speaker 0: Are they giving out free gold?

235
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:03,160
Speaker 0: I'm waiting in line.

236
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:04,800
Speaker 0: I'll wait in line the whole con for the free gold.

237
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,320
Speaker 1: Scott, beauty's in the eyes of the beholder.

238
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,358
Speaker 1: And for some people...

239
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,880
Speaker 0: You know what's more beautiful than any Resident Evil movie?

240
00:10:10,102 --> 00:10:10,519
Speaker 0: Free gold.

241
00:10:11,061 --> 00:10:11,959
Speaker 0: And you know what they don't got?

242
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:12,500
Speaker 1: Free gold.

243
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:16,200
Speaker 1: For some people, Resident Evil Afterlife, like that is the movie.

244
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:18,719
Speaker 0: You know what I was waiting that line for to go into Hall H?

245
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,158
Speaker 0: Zombie Will Eisner.

246
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:21,760
Speaker 0: Or maybe Zombie Tezuka also.

247
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:22,959
Speaker 0: That I would wait in line for.

248
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:23,860
Speaker 0: That might be dangerous.

249
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,078
Speaker 0: We have brought them back from the dead for you.

250
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:26,960
Speaker 0: Holy crap.

251
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:28,698
Speaker 0: Yes, you know.

252
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:32,960
Speaker 1: So anyway, to get back to the news here, because we actually have a show to review.

253
00:10:33,261 --> 00:10:33,515
Speaker 0: Oh, shit.

254
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,580
Speaker 1: So Hall H, Resident Evil Afterlife panel.

255
00:10:36,728 --> 00:10:36,918
Speaker 1: Okay.

256
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:38,218
Speaker 1: It's nearly over.

257
00:10:38,921 --> 00:10:46,569
Speaker 1: And a quote, "Altercation breaks out between two people who both are wearing the same limited edition Comic Con 2010 Harry Potter

258
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:47,333
Speaker 1: t-shirts.".

259
00:10:49,822 --> 00:10:50,054
Speaker 0: Okay.

260
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:59,880
Speaker 1: So one of them suggested that his friend, the person next to him, leave his seat because he wasn't into what was being shown.

261
00:11:00,422 --> 00:11:01,479
Speaker 1: So why don't you leave?

262
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,000
Speaker 1: You obviously don't care as much as I care about Resident Evil Afterlife.

263
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:07,819
Speaker 0: Who cares about Resident Evil Afterlife at all?

264
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:11,859
Speaker 1: And the guy who was sitting down tried to stab him in the eye with a pen.

265
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:13,238
Speaker 1: Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

266
00:11:14,543 --> 00:11:18,603
Speaker 0: So there was a guy sitting next to him and he said, "Why don't you leave if you don't like

267
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:18,827
Speaker 0: this?".

268
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,860
Speaker 1: And something happened.

269
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,679
Speaker 1: I don't have any details as to what happened.

270
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:29,740
Speaker 0: I thought I heard that there was a guy trying to like, you know, who left and then he was saving a seat for a friend and a guy tried to sit in the same seat.

271
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,580
Speaker 0: And that was what made the stabbing.

272
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,476
Speaker 1: This is the most recent news I could find.

273
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:41,812
Speaker 1: That the two people knew each other were wearing the same t-shirt, the limited edition Harry Potter Comic Con 2010 t-shirt.

274
00:11:43,422 --> 00:11:46,320
Speaker 1: And the best part is he didn't even get him in the eye.

275
00:11:46,541 --> 00:11:48,597
Speaker 1: He missed and just kind of scratched him a little bit.

276
00:11:50,364 --> 00:11:55,179
Speaker 1: The stabby was taken to the hospital and quote, "His injuries were non-life

277
00:11:55,219 --> 00:11:55,560
Speaker 1: threatening."

278
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:56,612
Speaker 1: Really?

279
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:00,100
Speaker 0: And the cool thing is- The worst part is you got to go to the hospital.

280
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,600
Speaker 0: Not, you know, that you're hurt.

281
00:12:03,143 --> 00:12:05,740
Speaker 0: You waited all in that whole line for the stupid Comic Con.

282
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:13,440
Speaker 0: You even got into the horrible Hell Hall H and now you have to leave for hours in the hospital waiting at the emergency room before you can come back.

283
00:12:13,581 --> 00:12:16,180
Speaker 1: He didn't even get to see the end of the Resident Evil panel.

284
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:19,059
Speaker 1: But apparently all the- What happened to the stab-er?

285
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,859
Speaker 0: Did he go to jail?

286
00:12:20,422 --> 00:12:22,360
Speaker 1: He was taken away by the police and to jail.

287
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,158
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

288
00:12:23,302 --> 00:12:23,879
Speaker 0: Does he out of jail?

289
00:12:24,343 --> 00:12:24,978
Speaker 1: I have no idea.

290
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:27,560
Speaker 0: That seems like the sort of one night in jail kind of thing.

291
00:12:27,740 --> 00:12:31,300
Speaker 0: Not like a trial, go to court, go to prison kind of thing.

292
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,580
Speaker 1: I don't know if I were the guy who got, you know, stabbed.

293
00:12:34,120 --> 00:12:35,680
Speaker 0: Yeah, but you really you can just press what?

294
00:12:35,841 --> 00:12:36,500
Speaker 0: Like an assault charge?

295
00:12:36,824 --> 00:12:37,580
Speaker 0: I'm not a lawyer.

296
00:12:38,482 --> 00:12:42,280
Speaker 1: No, I'd press like assault and intent to cause grievous injury.

297
00:12:43,142 --> 00:12:46,159
Speaker 0: It's not attempted murder because there's no way you could have murdered him with the pen.

298
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,718
Speaker 1: Pen to the eye could probably kill you.

299
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,960
Speaker 0: I don't know if it'd kill you.

300
00:12:49,081 --> 00:12:49,534
Speaker 0: You'd lose the eye.

301
00:12:50,466 --> 00:12:51,160
Speaker 1: Uh, far enough back.

302
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,339
Speaker 1: Brain, right there.

303
00:12:53,021 --> 00:12:55,100
Speaker 0: Okay, the odds of that are pretty unlikely.

304
00:12:55,461 --> 00:13:05,159
Speaker 0: You know, the most likely scenario in a crowded Hall H is that the ambulance would come and you would lose your eye and you'd have a wicked cool limited edition Harry Potter glass eye for the next Comic Con.

305
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,217
Speaker 1: I think they were selling them at the booth next to Hall H.

306
00:13:08,401 --> 00:13:11,117
Speaker 0: No, they were selling the Resident Evil movie glass eyes.

307
00:13:11,961 --> 00:13:21,420
Speaker 1: Once this nerd slap fight got out of control and after the pen came out, everyone else in the room freaking jumped the guy and held him down till the police got there and took him away.

308
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,880
Speaker 0: That's how it's going to go every time.

309
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,880
Speaker 1: Well, remember way back, this was like Otacon 2003.

310
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:31,060
Speaker 1: That one guy like went nuts and attacked that girl that we knew.

311
00:13:31,848 --> 00:13:32,120
Speaker 1: What?

312
00:13:32,441 --> 00:13:33,059
Speaker 1: You don't remember that?

313
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:33,598
Speaker 1: We were at Otacon.

314
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:40,519
Speaker 1: We were in the back room talking to the staff because we just run like the club summit and we were trying to like join the Otacon staff way back then.

315
00:13:41,022 --> 00:13:46,940
Speaker 1: So we're like walking with a bunch of Otacon staff and talking to them about like our plans and let's do, it was either 2003 or 2004.

316
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:52,020
Speaker 1: I think it was 2003 and we're like, like we're walking and we're like, yes, we've got it.

317
00:13:52,221 --> 00:13:53,420
Speaker 1: We're eating with the Otacon staff.

318
00:13:53,744 --> 00:13:54,218
Speaker 1: This is awesome.

319
00:13:54,841 --> 00:14:05,360
Speaker 1: And then we look up and I see like Pete and a bunch of our friends standing around a fight that has broken out and then they proceed to enter this fray and break it up.

320
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,778
Speaker 0: I don't remember the details of this.

321
00:14:07,303 --> 00:14:08,140
Speaker 1: Do you remember this at all?

322
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,779
Speaker 0: I remember there was something going on.

323
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,020
Speaker 1: That's all you remember?

324
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:16,340
Speaker 0: Like there was one dude who's wicked angry and he was related to somebody we knew maybe.

325
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:22,079
Speaker 1: I'm just not, I'm leaving out the names for privacy reasons, but I'm surprised you don't remember who was involved.

326
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:26,420
Speaker 0: I remember there was someone we didn't know who was all angry, who was related to someone we knew.

327
00:14:26,441 --> 00:14:27,036
Speaker 1: We knew who he was.

328
00:14:27,668 --> 00:14:27,900
Speaker 0: Okay.

329
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:28,884
Speaker 0: Wow.

330
00:14:29,903 --> 00:14:30,739
Speaker 1: Having some trouble here?

331
00:14:31,084 --> 00:14:31,700
Speaker 0: Oh, anyway.

332
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,240
Speaker 1: What did you eat for lunch yesterday?

333
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:34,199
Speaker 0: Yesterday?

334
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:35,540
Speaker 0: Peanut butter and jelly.

335
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:36,458
Speaker 1: Four days ago.

336
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:37,260
Speaker 0: Peanut butter.

337
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,711
Speaker 0: Well, four days ago was Sunday.

338
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:40,760
Speaker 1: I think you've got Alzheimer's.

339
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:41,879
Speaker 0: I didn't, I didn't eat lunch Sunday.

340
00:14:42,482 --> 00:14:42,609
Speaker 1: Uh huh.

341
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:43,616
Speaker 0: All right.

342
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:52,600
Speaker 1: Regardless, every nerd fight I've ever seen at a con has ended with someone intervening because it's really easy to intervene into nerd slap fights.

343
00:14:53,503 --> 00:14:55,720
Speaker 0: There aren't often fights where there's no intervention.

344
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:59,300
Speaker 0: Well, these public fights, public fights.

345
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:04,851
Speaker 1: That is the extent of the fullness of the knowledge of the stabbing in Hall H. Okay.

346
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:09,700
Speaker 0: So his is a bunch of really tiny news that are more anime manga related, right?

347
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,600
Speaker 0: Cause there were a bunch of comic news that were, you know, not manga, but you know what?

348
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,178
Speaker 0: They all sucked.

349
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:19,640
Speaker 0: So news number one, Eisner award winners, as is always at the comic con, right?

350
00:15:20,222 --> 00:15:20,940
Speaker 0: Only really important.

351
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:26,760
Speaker 0: Well, I'm sure there are other important winners, but the most important winner, Yoshihiro Tatsumi's, uh, drifting life.

352
00:15:27,142 --> 00:15:29,377
Speaker 0: It won two, two Eisner awards.

353
00:15:30,323 --> 00:15:30,979
Speaker 0: What does that mean?

354
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:33,339
Speaker 0: That means you should read it.

355
00:15:33,663 --> 00:15:34,879
Speaker 0: If you haven't read it, you suck.

356
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:35,837
Speaker 0: Read it now.

357
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,559
Speaker 0: No other manga has won any Eisner awards this year.

358
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
Speaker 0: So Yoshihiro Tatsumi's a drifting life.

359
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,559
Speaker 0: Go on Amazon, buy it or else you suck.

360
00:15:45,002 --> 00:15:45,720
Speaker 0: Two Eisner awards.

361
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:46,338
Speaker 0: That means read it.

362
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,219
Speaker 1: I think much more important.

363
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,180
Speaker 1: I'm sure you're going to talk about this.

364
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:52,780
Speaker 1: Some, uh, some important shows are released on DVD are going to be released on DVD.

365
00:15:53,260 --> 00:16:00,080
Speaker 0: Well, you know, the, uh, the galaxy express three, nine movie and also the second movie, which is just as awesome, right?

366
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:06,220
Speaker 0: Have been on VHS and we're on sci-fi channel, but now they're finally going to be on DVD from discotheque media.

367
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,619
Speaker 0: But discotheque is also releasing project ACO.

368
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:10,256
Speaker 1: Holy crap.

369
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,499
Speaker 1: That was in fact the third anime I ever saw.

370
00:16:15,463 --> 00:16:17,960
Speaker 1: And I think we talked about this like three or four years ago.

371
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,558
Speaker 0: Express movie might've been the third anime I saw that.

372
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:21,720
Speaker 0: It was that Saturday.

373
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:25,440
Speaker 1: It was like vampire hunter D, robot carnival, project ACO, galaxy express.

374
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,335
Speaker 1: Earth's answer to.

375
00:16:26,901 --> 00:16:28,780
Speaker 0: They're all old sci-fi channel stuff.

376
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,099
Speaker 1: Kashawn, robot hunter.

377
00:16:30,321 --> 00:16:36,900
Speaker 0: Interestingly enough in the very same, um, announcement, they announced that they're going to release sword fighting.

378
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,760
Speaker 0: Very good on DVD in the U S sort of fighting.

379
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:42,560
Speaker 1: Very good was a mediocre movie with very good sword fighting.

380
00:16:45,483 --> 00:16:55,480
Speaker 0: And what I didn't know what it says here is that, uh, the princess blade reimagines a historical manga that is written by Kazuo Kami Mora and also Kazuo.

381
00:16:55,581 --> 00:16:56,996
Speaker 0: Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

382
00:16:57,661 --> 00:17:00,460
Speaker 0: I didn't know there was any connection between Kazuo Koike and sword fighting.

383
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,260
Speaker 0: Very good article.

384
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:02,960
Speaker 1: Doesn't say what that is though.

385
00:17:03,866 --> 00:17:05,000
Speaker 0: What is that manga?

386
00:17:07,422 --> 00:17:08,599
Speaker 0: Oh, historical manga.

387
00:17:08,704 --> 00:17:09,140
Speaker 0: But yeah.

388
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:09,410
Speaker 0: Yeah.

389
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,015
Speaker 1: What is it?

390
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:11,455
Speaker 1: Why did they not tell us this?

391
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:12,539
Speaker 1: I don't know.

392
00:17:14,599 --> 00:17:17,180
Speaker 0: Um, yeah, but yeah, galaxy express movies.

393
00:17:17,320 --> 00:17:20,997
Speaker 0: Like I'm just going to buy them at like full price, whatever on Amazon.

394
00:17:21,037 --> 00:17:21,740
Speaker 1: project ACO too.

395
00:17:22,101 --> 00:17:35,189
Speaker 1: And I, as a kind of a shout out slash plug, you guys should go find, there's an old anime world order show where they reviewed project ACO and the history as to how and why project ACO was made is hilarious and independently.

396
00:17:35,209 --> 00:17:47,220
Speaker 1: project ACO is hilarious and independently, independently, anyone who watches project ACO before they turn like 11 will probably not understand that it is supposed to be a comedy.

397
00:17:47,482 --> 00:17:48,678
Speaker 0: You'll think it's a serious thing.

398
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:51,519
Speaker 1: I thought it was a straight up like dead serious sci-fi.

399
00:17:51,882 --> 00:17:54,840
Speaker 0: Anyway, also, uh, interesting releases, right?

400
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,640
Speaker 0: Drawn and quarterly.

401
00:17:55,821 --> 00:18:00,560
Speaker 0: Who's been doing some awesome releases of serious old high quality mangas, right?

402
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:07,020
Speaker 0: Is releasing two mangas written by the creator of, uh, giga no Kitaro.

403
00:18:07,662 --> 00:18:09,300
Speaker 1: Ah, not the good Kitaro.

404
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:10,260
Speaker 1: I prefer hakaba.

405
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:12,119
Speaker 1: Anyway, it's the same guy.

406
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:20,032
Speaker 1: I know, but it's not that gay, gay, gay Kitaro is kind of funny and Kitaro is hilarious or dark, depending on what kind of person is.

407
00:18:20,052 --> 00:18:21,259
Speaker 0: the same guy did both of them.

408
00:18:21,641 --> 00:18:26,240
Speaker 0: So this guy, uh, he did two other mangas that are coming out from drawn and quarterly.

409
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:32,617
Speaker 0: One of them is called onward towards our noble deaths, which is a war manga, which is like, Oh my God.

410
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,660
Speaker 1: That's a good title.

411
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:37,900
Speaker 0: And the other one is non non ba, which is about a boy in the thirties.

412
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:43,298
Speaker 0: Who's introduced to the world of, uh, you know, yokai and such, and he's going to see some awesome shit.

413
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:56,180
Speaker 0: So apparently that manga won the award for best comic book at the uncle in 07, which if anyone doesn't know on glam is basically the, uh, comic con of Europe.

414
00:18:56,701 --> 00:19:02,018
Speaker 0: So if you that's, you know, if you're in Europe, it's like board games, Essen, comic con on glam.

415
00:19:02,681 --> 00:19:07,940
Speaker 1: Actually, randomly, one of my coworkers sent me an article about S and they were like, how come you don't ever go there every year?

416
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,680
Speaker 0: And I was like, it's in fucking Essen.

417
00:19:12,251 --> 00:19:12,679
Speaker 0: Maybe we should go.

418
00:19:12,861 --> 00:19:13,240
Speaker 0: You know what?

419
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,660
Speaker 0: Next year, Essen wants it.

420
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:18,400
Speaker 1: Wait, this is dangerous because that's how we wait.

421
00:19:18,681 --> 00:19:19,899
Speaker 0: Maybe Essen is still this year.

422
00:19:20,222 --> 00:19:20,329
Speaker 1: Fuck.

423
00:19:20,886 --> 00:19:21,759
Speaker 1: I can't go this year.

424
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,900
Speaker 1: I got too much planned.

425
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,385
Speaker 0: We'll get, we're going to go to.

426
00:19:25,948 --> 00:19:33,800
Speaker 0: if, if Essen is this year still, and it hasn't happened yet, we're not going, but the Essen of 2011, watch it's on the same weekend as packs.

427
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,536
Speaker 0: Then we won't go.

428
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:34,872
Speaker 0: Yeah.

429
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,099
Speaker 0: But if it's just, you know, Essen, we'll go on.

430
00:19:38,441 --> 00:19:39,013
Speaker 0: Let's go to Essen.

431
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,280
Speaker 1: So briefly, but you know what?

432
00:19:41,660 --> 00:19:44,739
Speaker 0: If we go to Essen, let's also go and look at German castles and such and such and such.

433
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:47,179
Speaker 1: If I'm going to Europe, I'm taking at least a week off work.

434
00:19:47,361 --> 00:19:48,639
Speaker 0: Probably two.

435
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,260
Speaker 1: Thing is if it's in the spring, I'm going to Japan in the spring.

436
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:52,479
Speaker 1: So we'll, we'll see.

437
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:55,479
Speaker 0: We'll see when the Essen is, but let's, I don't even know.

438
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,099
Speaker 0: I just, that's all right.

439
00:19:57,721 --> 00:20:01,939
Speaker 1: A tiny bit, but this is worth discussing later, maybe in the forum, maybe on another show.

440
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:11,640
Speaker 1: But the guy who wrote Cowboy Bebop Daisato Sato said that basically said the anime industry sucks now and it's going to die within a few decades.

441
00:20:12,262 --> 00:20:12,598
Speaker 1: Obvious.

442
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:16,696
Speaker 1: He has a lot of interesting reasons why, and it's mad props to him for having the balls to speak up.

443
00:20:17,164 --> 00:20:18,359
Speaker 1: But I'll point something out.

444
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,599
Speaker 0: Say everything we already know.

445
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:24,360
Speaker 1: He said, you know, there are anime now that are still fighting these stagnating trends.

446
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,479
Speaker 0: There, there sure are.

447
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:27,560
Speaker 1: Eden of the East and Ergo Proxy.

448
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,100
Speaker 0: They're all, they're all in no automata.

449
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:30,980
Speaker 1: And we started watching both of those.

450
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:31,620
Speaker 1: Didn't finish them.

451
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:33,880
Speaker 0: I feel like that block get canceled or not.

452
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:37,520
Speaker 1: I don't know, but I feel like I'm just going to buy Ergo Proxy.

453
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,759
Speaker 1: We got to watch all of it.

454
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:39,519
Speaker 1: Start from the beginning.

455
00:20:39,942 --> 00:20:41,659
Speaker 0: I'm watching Eden of the East right now.

456
00:20:42,243 --> 00:20:44,720
Speaker 0: I watched the first episode a long time ago, but now I'm rewatching.

457
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:51,080
Speaker 1: I rewatched episode one yesterday and I guess episode two today, but I'm not going to talk about the rest of the, like the impetus of his article.

458
00:20:51,320 --> 00:20:56,000
Speaker 1: I want to point out one thing that was unpointed out by many people talking about this.

459
00:20:56,104 --> 00:20:56,258
Speaker 0: Okay.

460
00:20:57,160 --> 00:21:04,116
Speaker 1: Eden of the East and Ergo Proxy, the two shows that he says, yes, they're fighting the good fight, have something very important in common.

461
00:21:04,156 --> 00:21:04,700
Speaker 0: that he wrote them.

462
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,715
Speaker 1: He wrote both of them.

463
00:21:09,141 --> 00:21:13,560
Speaker 0: Even so though, he is, he is, uh, you know, he writes, he writes the good animes.

464
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:14,197
Speaker 0: What can you say?

465
00:21:22,922 --> 00:21:25,640
Speaker 1: So things of the day, what do you got for me, Scott?

466
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,559
Speaker 0: Oh, you want to know what I got?

467
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:28,340
Speaker 0: Even though mine is vastly superior.

468
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:34,460
Speaker 0: So one of the greatest anime voice actors of all time, maybe not if the greatest.

469
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:37,119
Speaker 1: Well, it's either pumpkin head or a door.

470
00:21:39,852 --> 00:21:40,220
Speaker 0: No idea.

471
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:40,564
Speaker 0: Yeah.

472
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,179
Speaker 0: So he is awesome.

473
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:54,100
Speaker 0: Uh, and what I did not realize is I don't know if this is a meme or if he's actually doing this, I cannot tell, right?

474
00:21:54,303 --> 00:21:54,798
Speaker 0: Either way.

475
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:55,760
Speaker 0: It's a thing of the day.

476
00:21:55,801 --> 00:21:56,359
Speaker 0: That is awesome.

477
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:03,500
Speaker 0: What do you, what we got here is there are multiple videos on YouTube that are Norio Wakamoto doing the opener to some anime.

478
00:22:03,602 --> 00:22:04,159
Speaker 0: So here's Norio.

479
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,118
Speaker 0: Wakamoto sings, Evangeline opener.

480
00:22:06,501 --> 00:22:09,700
Speaker 0: Well, Rio for good channel opener.

481
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,877
Speaker 0: So, but the one that is my thing of the day is Norio.

482
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,240
Speaker 0: Wakamoto sings lucky star opener.

483
00:22:15,402 --> 00:22:16,898
Speaker 0: That is my thing of the day.

484
00:22:17,588 --> 00:22:18,080
Speaker 0: Oh, snap.

485
00:22:18,161 --> 00:22:20,399
Speaker 0: You got to see this shit and well hear this shit.

486
00:22:21,082 --> 00:22:32,098
Speaker 0: Also this actually some legitimate, uh, documentaries, at least, uh, interviews with Norio Wakamoto on YouTube that you should totally check out and, uh, plenty of other scenes, uh, where you can hear him.

487
00:22:32,841 --> 00:22:42,060
Speaker 0: Doing awesome things like, you know, speaking in English as, uh, as the, the Catholic in Hellsing or being Chiyo's dad or whatever else he's doing.

488
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,740
Speaker 1: So that is pretty awesome.

489
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,560
Speaker 0: It's all about Norio Wakamoto today in Scott's thing of the day.

490
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:51,639
Speaker 1: I have for you a list of the 10 most famous penises in the land.

491
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,360
Speaker 0: It's got Ruben.

492
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,240
Speaker 1: Maybe Juan Batista dos Santos.

493
00:22:58,045 --> 00:22:59,020
Speaker 0: That was me in a past life.

494
00:22:59,965 --> 00:23:00,938
Speaker 1: You know what his deal was?

495
00:23:01,161 --> 00:23:01,776
Speaker 0: It was so big.

496
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:02,474
Speaker 1: No, no.

497
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:03,600
Speaker 0: You wrapped around the world.

498
00:23:04,563 --> 00:23:05,960
Speaker 0: That's why everyone knew it was so famous.

499
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:07,497
Speaker 1: Daddy to PP.

500
00:23:09,486 --> 00:23:10,180
Speaker 1: Both functional.

501
00:23:10,727 --> 00:23:11,099
Speaker 0: For serious.

502
00:23:11,260 --> 00:23:11,780
Speaker 1: For serious.

503
00:23:11,981 --> 00:23:12,859
Speaker 0: Did the P come out both?

504
00:23:13,762 --> 00:23:15,219
Speaker 1: Uh, actually it talks about that.

505
00:23:15,483 --> 00:23:16,840
Speaker 1: Here's a real picture of the double penis.

506
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,512
Speaker 0: Was it actually two penises or they were separate?

507
00:23:19,613 --> 00:23:20,939
Speaker 0: or was it they had, he had?

508
00:23:20,999 --> 00:23:23,840
Speaker 0: just, they were separate or is just the hose had a Y splitter.

509
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,698
Speaker 1: Now they were separate.

510
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:25,460
Speaker 0: Really?

511
00:23:25,541 --> 00:23:28,200
Speaker 0: So he could actually, maybe he had to pee on the right and then maybe later.

512
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:33,340
Speaker 1: actually the story as to who he ended up having a relationship with is quite amazing.

513
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:34,859
Speaker 0: Oh wow.

514
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:45,079
Speaker 1: He could probably, he could do the shocker, but, but that's, there's the, uh, the half millimeter penis that caused a children's book from Germany to be banned in America.

515
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:46,759
Speaker 0: Rim was, rim was the model for that.

516
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:47,698
Speaker 1: Dirk Diggler.

517
00:23:48,324 --> 00:23:49,300
Speaker 1: And it goes on from there.

518
00:23:49,563 --> 00:23:50,619
Speaker 1: It's an interesting list.

519
00:23:51,102 --> 00:23:53,598
Speaker 1: The only, there's one disturbing one toward the end too.

520
00:23:53,980 --> 00:24:01,640
Speaker 1: If you count John Wayne Bobbitt and Rasputin's penis is either very large or that is actually some sort of root vegetable.

521
00:24:02,202 --> 00:24:04,180
Speaker 0: I doubt that that is actually Rasputin's penis.

522
00:24:04,901 --> 00:24:07,959
Speaker 1: If it is, they ripped out a sizable portion of that man.

523
00:24:09,081 --> 00:24:14,756
Speaker 0: Well, you know, if you, depending on which tail you believe, I mean, they would have had access to the entire body.

524
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:19,600
Speaker 1: So, so the meta moment I suppose is in order.

525
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,820
Speaker 1: Otakon is this weekend.

526
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:22,978
Speaker 0: We won't be there.

527
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:27,753
Speaker 1: This is the first time in almost a decade that we have not been to eight Otakons in a row.

528
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:29,020
Speaker 0: This would have been number nine.

529
00:24:29,420 --> 00:24:30,558
Speaker 1: You almost said Otakon.

530
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:31,333
Speaker 0: Otakon.

531
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:32,258
Speaker 1: You said Ana.

532
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,140
Speaker 1: No, I get to this day.

533
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:38,440
Speaker 1: It amazes me when someone will say Otakon.

534
00:24:38,621 --> 00:24:40,940
Speaker 0: Well, it doesn't mean there's that guy in metal gear, right?

535
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,020
Speaker 0: And they always get confused.

536
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:42,450
Speaker 0: But it's Adam.

537
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,117
Speaker 1: It's our friend Adam who does it.

538
00:24:44,642 --> 00:24:49,077
Speaker 0: He's been to Otakon for- It's Otakon and it's for Otaku, right?

539
00:24:49,980 --> 00:24:51,879
Speaker 0: It is a kon of Otaku.

540
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,299
Speaker 0: So it's Otakon.

541
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,058
Speaker 1: It's for American Otaku.

542
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:59,020
Speaker 1: Yes, but you know- We have a slightly different definition of the word.

543
00:24:59,982 --> 00:25:01,580
Speaker 0: It's Otaku Otakon.

544
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,371
Speaker 1: Yeah, but Otakon is this weekend, the 31st and 1st.

545
00:25:05,201 --> 00:25:08,059
Speaker 1: You know, we're not doing any panels at it and we'll see what we do next year.

546
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:11,120
Speaker 1: But one thing I will note for those of you who are going.

547
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:12,660
Speaker 1: They don't mail the badges.

548
00:25:13,302 --> 00:25:15,320
Speaker 1: The line on Thursday is very long.

549
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,479
Speaker 0: The line on Friday is worse.

550
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:23,640
Speaker 1: Yes, there is going to be likely a severe thunderstorm in Baltimore Thursday while everyone's going to be in line trying to get their badges.

551
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:24,359
Speaker 0: Bring your umbrella.

552
00:25:25,402 --> 00:25:28,158
Speaker 1: If there is a thunderstorm, I suggest to you.

553
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:32,940
Speaker 1: But I also suggest not to listen to me because I'm not liable if you get struck by lightning.

554
00:25:33,501 --> 00:25:36,820
Speaker 1: Do not get out of that line because the Friday line will be a disaster.

555
00:25:37,020 --> 00:25:37,679
Speaker 1: It always is.

556
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:39,460
Speaker 0: Yeah, it is rain Thursday.

557
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:40,578
Speaker 0: No matter what.

558
00:25:40,781 --> 00:25:44,320
Speaker 0: If there's rain on Thursday, a lot of people will probably leave the Thursday line.

559
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:46,420
Speaker 0: This is just, you know, logic, right?

560
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:49,160
Speaker 0: And they'll go to the Friday line where there won't be rain.

561
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,359
Speaker 0: You do not want to do this.

562
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,319
Speaker 0: The Thursday line, you will succeed in getting your badge.

563
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:57,420
Speaker 0: But the Friday line, the Friday line is multi hours already.

564
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:01,936
Speaker 1: Now, imagine if half the people on Thursday and they get like 10 to 14,000 people on Thursday.

565
00:26:03,703 --> 00:26:05,998
Speaker 1: If even a quarter of them get in the Friday line.

566
00:26:08,481 --> 00:26:17,020
Speaker 0: And also a recommendation, you know, shortly towards the middle of the day on Friday, what's going to happen is the lines will pretty much be gone.

567
00:26:17,346 --> 00:26:17,620
Speaker 0: Right.

568
00:26:18,101 --> 00:26:21,579
Speaker 0: And, you know, the whole registration area sort of opens up and you can walk through there easily.

569
00:26:22,161 --> 00:26:27,419
Speaker 0: As soon as that happens, go get your 18 plus wristband for violent movies, because otherwise you're gonna have to wait.

570
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:32,814
Speaker 0: If you wait until right before the violent movies, you're probably going to miss some of them waiting in that stupid line to get your wristbands.

571
00:26:32,834 --> 00:26:34,196
Speaker 0: to get your wristband early in the day.

572
00:26:34,631 --> 00:26:34,778
Speaker 1: Yep.

573
00:26:35,649 --> 00:26:35,999
Speaker 1: Oh, God.

574
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,680
Speaker 1: We don't have as much other advice we should really give.

575
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:42,319
Speaker 0: There's going to be a lot of actually there's going to be a lot of awesome stuff at Otacon.

576
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,175
Speaker 0: That's not us.

577
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,000
Speaker 0: None of it's going to be us.

578
00:26:45,040 --> 00:26:46,158
Speaker 0: So you should check it all out.

579
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:46,595
Speaker 0: Yep.

580
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:47,960
Speaker 0: Like Yoshida Brothers.

581
00:26:48,160 --> 00:26:48,676
Speaker 0: Check that out.

582
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:49,558
Speaker 0: Artist Allie.

583
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,357
Speaker 0: Check that out.

584
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:51,980
Speaker 0: Violent movies late at night.

585
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:52,637
Speaker 0: Check that out.

586
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:52,848
Speaker 1: Yep.

587
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:05,339
Speaker 1: But I will say if you have any feedback about Otacon that you want them to know, like say you wanted them to mail the badges or you want to know why we weren't there or you wanted Daryl Surratt to have panels or you wanted Super Art Fight to do their awesome show.

588
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:12,980
Speaker 1: instead of Iron Artist's somewhat lame show, you should go to the con feedback because that is like the only time where Otacon really gets feedback.

589
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:19,520
Speaker 0: And even if you don't want to give feedback at the at the Otacon feedback session, they also show the winners of the AMV contest.

590
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,460
Speaker 0: So don't waste your time at the real AMV contest.

591
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:22,459
Speaker 0: Yeah, forget that thing.

592
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:27,060
Speaker 0: Go see the winners at the closing ceremonies and also they will announce the dates of the next Otacon.

593
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,639
Speaker 1: So you can then get the hotel early and ruin it for everybody else like we always do.

594
00:27:30,845 --> 00:27:31,077
Speaker 0: Yes.

595
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:34,640
Speaker 0: And they will also announce, I think, the attendance figures usually.

596
00:27:35,068 --> 00:27:35,238
Speaker 1: Yep.

597
00:27:35,781 --> 00:27:39,120
Speaker 0: And they'll show probably the opening and closing animations for the con again.

598
00:27:39,265 --> 00:27:39,393
Speaker 0: Oh, wow.

599
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,328
Speaker 0: We're not going to get to see him because they always they keep them under lock and key.

600
00:27:42,641 --> 00:27:45,980
Speaker 1: I know I've been I've been trying to find a bootleg copy of any of them.

601
00:27:46,060 --> 00:27:47,680
Speaker 0: And I think it is not going to be this way.

602
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:50,439
Speaker 0: We've seen them all the first two, but we're not going to see this one.

603
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:53,739
Speaker 1: Well, from the staff forum, I know a lot about the animation this year.

604
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, but it's pretty high quality.

605
00:27:55,945 --> 00:27:56,138
Speaker 0: Probably.

606
00:27:56,601 --> 00:27:58,900
Speaker 0: But we're not going to see it because they don't show it anywhere else.

607
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,200
Speaker 0: That's fine.

608
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:02,080
Speaker 1: I'm pushing to get New York Comic-Con to start having its own animation.

609
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:06,419
Speaker 0: Dude, you just got to put your freaking opening animation on YouTube because it's a great advertisement for your Japanese.

610
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,619
Speaker 1: People are stupid about that sort of thing.

611
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,360
Speaker 0: So you just smack them upside the head.

612
00:28:10,421 --> 00:28:11,320
Speaker 0: You say, oh, yeah.

613
00:28:11,581 --> 00:28:13,160
Speaker 0: Oh, well, you know, you don't let us show on YouTube.

614
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:14,238
Speaker 0: We're just not going to show it at all.

615
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,940
Speaker 0: Why did we put all that hard work into it?

616
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,200
Speaker 0: Well, you know, we can't show it on YouTube.

617
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:17,978
Speaker 0: So what the hell is the point?

618
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:19,720
Speaker 0: Yeah.

619
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:19,884
Speaker 0: No.

620
00:28:20,182 --> 00:28:20,397
Speaker 0: Okay.

621
00:28:20,542 --> 00:28:20,695
Speaker 0: Okay.

622
00:28:20,861 --> 00:28:21,380
Speaker 0: You can find on YouTube.

623
00:28:21,541 --> 00:28:22,034
Speaker 0: Oh, thank you.

624
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,037
Speaker 0: That's a Japanese one.

625
00:28:23,302 --> 00:28:23,518
Speaker 1: All right.

626
00:28:23,783 --> 00:28:25,000
Speaker 1: The book club is done.

627
00:28:25,161 --> 00:28:27,598
Speaker 1: So, you know, the next book club book is the way we have.

628
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:31,999
Speaker 1: This is a new announcement is going to be a Ray Bradbury collection of short stories.

629
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:32,856
Speaker 0: Okay.

630
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:36,400
Speaker 1: We'll do a show on it later, but you should read some Ray Bradbury.

631
00:28:36,928 --> 00:28:37,160
Speaker 0: Okay.

632
00:28:37,220 --> 00:28:38,178
Speaker 0: Which, which book though?

633
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,056
Speaker 0: Should I even really say people are just going to go start buying random ones and they're going to get the wrong one.

634
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:46,159
Speaker 1: And then red apples of the sun or golden apples of the sun.

635
00:28:46,463 --> 00:28:47,560
Speaker 0: You don't know how to remember.

636
00:28:48,001 --> 00:28:49,474
Speaker 0: That's why you fail.

637
00:28:50,303 --> 00:28:51,018
Speaker 0: I've never heard of it.

638
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,359
Speaker 0: So I've heard of Ray Bradbury, but I've never heard of either.

639
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,960
Speaker 1: Have you read any of Ray Bradbury stuff?

640
00:28:55,426 --> 00:28:56,545
Speaker 0: Fahrenheit 451.

641
00:28:56,545 --> 00:28:57,400
Speaker 1: Any of his short stories?

642
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,491
Speaker 1: Fahrenheit 451 is pretty short.

643
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:03,079
Speaker 1: He tends to write like four to five page short stories.

644
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:03,920
Speaker 0: Oh no.

645
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,720
Speaker 1: Most of the ones are like, here's the concept.

646
00:29:07,023 --> 00:29:07,554
Speaker 1: Let's go.

647
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:10,660
Speaker 0: Maybe you should turn some of them into RPGs.

648
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:14,540
Speaker 1: Like one of them in this is let's go back in time and kill a fucking dinosaur.

649
00:29:15,747 --> 00:29:16,178
Speaker 1: It's pretty good.

650
00:29:18,301 --> 00:29:21,457
Speaker 0: Also the New York Comic-Con New York anime festival, October 8th, 9th, and 10th.

651
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:22,218
Speaker 1: Right.

652
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:22,547
Speaker 0: Yep.

653
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,680
Speaker 1: And we will be there in force doing crazy shit.

654
00:29:26,082 --> 00:29:29,498
Speaker 1: Also that weekend nerd NYC board game night, Friday, October 8th.

655
00:29:29,900 --> 00:29:34,360
Speaker 1: Also that weekend, 8th, 9th, and 10th, 10, 10, 10, the burning wheel convention in Astoria.

656
00:29:34,721 --> 00:29:38,200
Speaker 1: Also in New York city, labor day weekend packs.

657
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,480
Speaker 1: We are doing big shit at packs.

658
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:43,059
Speaker 1: We cannot announce it yet.

659
00:29:43,383 --> 00:29:44,860
Speaker 1: We've been, there've been a lot of hints.

660
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,879
Speaker 0: We've been talking about the packs.

661
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,460
Speaker 0: It is going to be boom explode.

662
00:29:48,621 --> 00:29:51,540
Speaker 0: Cause there'll be so much awesomeness contained in the small area.

663
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:52,420
Speaker 0: And that's not even.

664
00:29:52,601 --> 00:29:52,956
Speaker 0: And you know what?

665
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:55,540
Speaker 0: Next year packs East is, I mean, this is cruise missile.

666
00:29:56,103 --> 00:30:01,078
Speaker 0: We're talking about here, but next year packs East is going to have to bring the nuke in order to, to, to step up the game.

667
00:30:01,701 --> 00:30:05,734
Speaker 0: It's basically, it's basically like a one upsmanship between the East and the West every year.

668
00:30:06,162 --> 00:30:09,000
Speaker 0: The one is going to be better than the other was in the previous year.

669
00:30:09,020 --> 00:30:11,460
Speaker 0: So the most recent packs will always be the best packs.

670
00:30:11,723 --> 00:30:12,919
Speaker 1: Maybe that's their plan.

671
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:18,020
Speaker 1: So every year Tycho can say at every con, this is truly the real packs.

672
00:30:18,485 --> 00:30:19,058
Speaker 0: That is correct.

673
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,498
Speaker 0: Except the East is the real packs.

674
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:22,138
Speaker 1: Yeah.

675
00:30:23,603 --> 00:30:25,275
Speaker 1: Um, but no, we live in the East.

676
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,080
Speaker 1: We're doing egregiously unrealized potential.

677
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,100
Speaker 1: We're also doing our home or hardcore panel game mechanics and mechanism design.

678
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:32,476
Speaker 0: All right.

679
00:30:32,903 --> 00:30:33,380
Speaker 0: Are you ready?

680
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,260
Speaker 0: Are you ready for something?

681
00:30:34,641 --> 00:30:37,560
Speaker 0: I got one more new announcement and we're done with the meta moment.

682
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:38,558
Speaker 1: Is this something I know about?

683
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:39,380
Speaker 0: Maybe.

684
00:30:39,585 --> 00:30:39,819
Speaker 0: Okay.

685
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:49,311
Speaker 0: One week after packs West in New York city is recess on Saturday all day in a, what is it?

686
00:30:49,621 --> 00:30:51,719
Speaker 0: Manhattan something, something they call the same place.

687
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,616
Speaker 0: The same place.

688
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:57,880
Speaker 0: There's going to be a full day of board and role playing games courtesy of nerd NYC.

689
00:30:58,402 --> 00:31:00,279
Speaker 1: Uh, I'll probably, I might run an RPG.

690
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:04,414
Speaker 0: I'm debating what to do in the board game by popular request.

691
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,679
Speaker 0: We have to sign up for it with everyone else.

692
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,778
Speaker 1: I will sign up for it.

693
00:31:09,024 --> 00:31:09,498
Speaker 0: It'll be full.

694
00:31:09,922 --> 00:31:11,979
Speaker 1: I mean, if I run a game, I can sign up before everyone else.

695
00:31:12,981 --> 00:31:17,780
Speaker 0: So in the other time slot, I think you sign up for your own game before everyone else.

696
00:31:18,141 --> 00:31:24,280
Speaker 1: I don't think you sign up that one of the perks of running a game is you can sign up for another game before everyone else gets a crack at it.

697
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:24,672
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

698
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:26,799
Speaker 1: You didn't remember that or you didn't do that last time.

699
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:27,417
Speaker 0: I didn't know that.

700
00:31:27,764 --> 00:31:28,440
Speaker 0: Ah, I don't think that.

701
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,459
Speaker 0: I think that may be a new rule.

702
00:31:29,541 --> 00:31:29,840
Speaker 0: Anyway.

703
00:31:30,121 --> 00:31:31,538
Speaker 1: I remember that being the rule last time.

704
00:31:31,701 --> 00:31:32,198
Speaker 0: Oh, we'll see.

705
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:35,100
Speaker 0: I don't know if that's a rule or not, but anyway, that is the end of the meta moment.

706
00:31:36,483 --> 00:31:39,160
Speaker 1: So there, we often don't talk about newer anime.

707
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:44,720
Speaker 1: I mean, right now I'm watching Hokuto no Ken and watching all of Leiji Matsumoto's works.

708
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,700
Speaker 0: Uh, I've finished watching space symphony Mitel.

709
00:31:47,881 --> 00:31:51,900
Speaker 0: So now I'm watching Eden of the East and I'm trying to get gun frontier.

710
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:55,080
Speaker 1: Well, I'm going to get on DVD and I'm going to get ergo proxy.

711
00:31:55,200 --> 00:32:00,060
Speaker 1: We can burn through that and do a show on it, but a new anime that's worth talking about.

712
00:32:00,241 --> 00:32:04,140
Speaker 1: And many of you are watching it now before we review it, we're not going to spoil anything.

713
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:06,320
Speaker 0: We already did a preview of it, but we didn't really.

714
00:32:06,641 --> 00:32:08,200
Speaker 0: It was basically, we talked about one episode.

715
00:32:08,380 --> 00:32:10,597
Speaker 0: Now we've seen, we've seen the whole show, both of us.

716
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:12,419
Speaker 0: So now we can do a real show on it.

717
00:32:13,002 --> 00:32:15,780
Speaker 1: And what I'll say is that you shouldn't even need to listen to this.

718
00:32:16,082 --> 00:32:17,659
Speaker 1: You should be watching Dora.

719
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:21,700
Speaker 0: It is if you haven't watched it already, in which case you should have watched that.

720
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,920
Speaker 1: It is a timeless anime forever because it is too soon.

721
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,079
Speaker 1: I am too close to it.

722
00:32:26,402 --> 00:32:27,539
Speaker 1: We can't put it in anime.

723
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:30,619
Speaker 0: You should say, I don't think it's, I don't think it's that good.

724
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,060
Speaker 1: No, but we can't put it in anime.

725
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:36,720
Speaker 1: You should see or anything just because it's too new, but you should watch it.

726
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:37,720
Speaker 1: Jesus Christ.

727
00:32:37,903 --> 00:32:38,698
Speaker 1: Should you watch it?

728
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,439
Speaker 1: Especially if you're one of those people.

729
00:32:40,964 --> 00:32:42,060
Speaker 1: And this happens to a lot of anime.

730
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:45,960
Speaker 0: If you're tired of moe shows and you're tired of shounen fighting shows.

731
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:56,780
Speaker 1: Very specifically, if you watched a lot of anime in the past and you've started to fizzle out as an anime fan, for whatever reason, this show will basically kick you in the nuts right back into anime.

732
00:32:57,021 --> 00:32:57,319
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

733
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:59,679
Speaker 0: This is, this is the good kind of show that we're always looking for.

734
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:05,340
Speaker 1: So Dora is by the same guy, or at least directed by the same guy who did Bakano.

735
00:33:05,962 --> 00:33:07,280
Speaker 1: And there are very similar shows.

736
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:10,200
Speaker 1: In fact, there's a cameo for Bakano in Dora.

737
00:33:10,283 --> 00:33:10,409
Speaker 1: Yeah.

738
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:13,540
Speaker 0: There's a couple, there's a couple of references to Bakano in Dora.

739
00:33:13,921 --> 00:33:20,875
Speaker 0: But the thing is Dora, Dora, I think it's Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, Dora, right.

740
00:33:23,941 --> 00:33:26,360
Speaker 0: And it's not, it's just annoying.

741
00:33:26,862 --> 00:33:29,340
Speaker 0: And you're just making yourself sound retarded.

742
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:36,759
Speaker 0: Anyway, the reason it's called Dora, Dora, Dora is because that's, it's an onomatopoeia for, you know, a motorcycle.

743
00:33:37,062 --> 00:33:40,220
Speaker 0: And there is a very important character riding motorcycle all around town.

744
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:47,274
Speaker 0: So it's like, dude, you know, uh, it's based on some visual novels as many animes and mangas are.

745
00:33:47,741 --> 00:33:56,840
Speaker 1: And unlike the usual situation, when something is based on a visual novel or an anime, the anime is moving slow enough to where there's no filler.

746
00:33:57,342 --> 00:34:00,000
Speaker 0: There, it's not like they, well, it's not a matter of moving slowly.

747
00:34:00,129 --> 00:34:00,280
Speaker 0: Right.

748
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:04,699
Speaker 0: I think the visual, from what I understand, I could be wrong, is that the visual novels are all done.

749
00:34:04,801 --> 00:34:07,277
Speaker 0: And there's so many of them that I think maybe five or six ish.

750
00:34:08,041 --> 00:34:11,100
Speaker 0: And the anime basically covers the material of the first two.

751
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:18,980
Speaker 0: So you have half of the half of the season, like the first 12 or 13 episodes, basically cover volume one and the rest of the show covers volume two.

752
00:34:19,121 --> 00:34:22,059
Speaker 0: And then you don't get volume three, four or five and so on.

753
00:34:22,525 --> 00:34:23,280
Speaker 0: They're not animated.

754
00:34:23,525 --> 00:34:24,058
Speaker 0: So that's that.

755
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:28,560
Speaker 1: Of course, I get the impression that this was very popular, so we'll see what happens.

756
00:34:28,780 --> 00:34:34,060
Speaker 0: Hopefully, hopefully they will just continue to turn the visual novels into anime because I can't read the visual.

757
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:35,418
Speaker 1: Tell there's no AV.

758
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:40,438
Speaker 0: At the very least, maybe I've, you know, quite a few visual novels have been brought out in the U.S.

759
00:34:40,741 --> 00:34:41,078
Speaker 0: Translated.

760
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:53,100
Speaker 0: Not that many, but you while I would read this one, if they if they try, I haven't bought any of them yet, but if they translated this one, I would buy it if they actually came out with all the volumes, just because I want to know what happens.

761
00:34:53,320 --> 00:35:01,520
Speaker 1: So I look forward also to what things in the future, because Takahiro Omori, the guy who directed Bakano and he's definitely he's going to do another show.

762
00:35:01,621 --> 00:35:03,240
Speaker 0: He's done two successful shows so far.

763
00:35:04,085 --> 00:35:05,220
Speaker 1: Not only that, look at his credits.

764
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:12,739
Speaker 1: He is one of the old guard people who clearly worked under other people and learn the trade the old way.

765
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:13,878
Speaker 0: What else did he work on?

766
00:35:14,401 --> 00:35:17,000
Speaker 1: He he did like animation for X driver.

767
00:35:17,140 --> 00:35:17,900
Speaker 1: He was the series director.

768
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:18,840
Speaker 0: X driver.

769
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,037
Speaker 1: For Fancy Lala.

770
00:35:20,686 --> 00:35:20,920
Speaker 1: All right.

771
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:21,679
Speaker 1: He did a Lupin.

772
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:23,090
Speaker 1: He did a Lupin.

773
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,339
Speaker 0: If you haven't done a Lupin, you're not an anime.

774
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:25,939
Speaker 1: Here's the thing.

775
00:35:26,202 --> 00:35:27,159
Speaker 1: The thing that we always look for.

776
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,059
Speaker 1: And this is the secret.

777
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:29,160
Speaker 0: Even Steve Bennett did Lupin.

778
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:34,739
Speaker 1: If you find a guy who directed something and you see that he did like the key animation for a bunch of old stuff.

779
00:35:35,180 --> 00:35:37,238
Speaker 1: He's probably one of the protege's.

780
00:35:37,842 --> 00:35:40,140
Speaker 1: He did the key animation for one of the Ursa Yatsura movies.

781
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,049
Speaker 0: Yeah.

782
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:44,060
Speaker 1: And he directed a bunch of other stuff and he's all over the place.

783
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:54,330
Speaker 1: But I think he is that these two are the, you know, Dora and Bakano are the shows where he is finally like, I'm directing and I will continue to direct stuff like this until I die.

784
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:58,339
Speaker 0: I look forward to his next work, which I hope actually comes to be.

785
00:35:58,945 --> 00:35:59,900
Speaker 0: And I hope he is not fired.

786
00:36:00,100 --> 00:36:01,620
Speaker 1: Go back and watch the end of Fancy Lala.

787
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:02,320
Speaker 1: Yeah.

788
00:36:04,502 --> 00:36:05,940
Speaker 1: Scott, he was the series director.

789
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:07,100
Speaker 0: Oh, I will.

790
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:09,559
Speaker 0: I will let you go tell me the secret of the dinosaurs.

791
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,219
Speaker 1: He storyboarded the first and last episodes.

792
00:36:12,644 --> 00:36:12,855
Speaker 0: Okay.

793
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:15,160
Speaker 1: He also directed the first and last episode.

794
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,679
Speaker 0: When you figure out the secret of the dinosaurs, just come tell me.

795
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:21,959
Speaker 1: You realize once I know the secret of the dinosaurs, I'm going to tell you that I know it and I'm not going to tell you it.

796
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:26,639
Speaker 0: I'll just stab you with a pen near the eye, but kind of miss.

797
00:36:27,822 --> 00:36:29,240
Speaker 0: While I'm wearing my limited edition.

798
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:43,459
Speaker 1: Unlike Dora, Bakano, you know, if someone has seen none of it and you're trying to tell them what it's about without spoiling anything or spoiling kind of the big reveals of the show or even the early kind of, oh, that's what the show's like.

799
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:44,716
Speaker 1: Bakano is very easy.

800
00:36:45,601 --> 00:36:48,060
Speaker 1: It's about, you know, immortal gangsters who are awesome.

801
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:48,996
Speaker 1: Let's rock.

802
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:49,592
Speaker 0: Hmm.

803
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:59,715
Speaker 1: Dora is about a bunch of people living in a district of around Tokyo, like an urban area, Ikebukuro.

804
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:00,480
Speaker 0: Okay.

805
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:06,260
Speaker 1: I just, it's not relevant and interesting things happen.

806
00:37:07,042 --> 00:37:18,499
Speaker 0: Well, more, more in, I think a better explanation is that there are people that live in Ikebukuro and things are pretty interesting because it's a happening kind of place, but there's all these urban legends and they're real, but they're real.

807
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:19,518
Speaker 0: All of them.

808
00:37:19,941 --> 00:37:25,180
Speaker 0: So it's like people always whispering about the, oh, the, there's a secret gang called the dollars.

809
00:37:25,241 --> 00:37:25,936
Speaker 0: Yeah, there really is.

810
00:37:26,545 --> 00:37:27,220
Speaker 0: Uh, oh man.

811
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,940
Speaker 0: There's a, there's a headless biker.

812
00:37:29,062 --> 00:37:29,776
Speaker 0: Yeah, there really is.

813
00:37:30,084 --> 00:37:30,439
Speaker 0: You know?

814
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,260
Speaker 1: And it's like, or that black Russian guy who sells the sushi.

815
00:37:33,421 --> 00:37:34,980
Speaker 1: He is crazy dangerous.

816
00:37:35,104 --> 00:37:35,260
Speaker 1: Yeah.

817
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,120
Speaker 1: He really backstory.

818
00:37:36,428 --> 00:37:36,513
Speaker 1: Yeah.

819
00:37:37,201 --> 00:37:38,800
Speaker 1: Shizu Oh, dressed like a bartender.

820
00:37:38,981 --> 00:37:40,360
Speaker 1: Fucking beats people to death.

821
00:37:40,382 --> 00:37:40,470
Speaker 1: Yep.

822
00:37:40,622 --> 00:37:40,936
Speaker 1: Right there.

823
00:37:41,082 --> 00:37:41,193
Speaker 0: Yep.

824
00:37:41,260 --> 00:37:41,617
Speaker 0: Yeah, he does.

825
00:37:42,007 --> 00:37:42,420
Speaker 0: He's crazy.

826
00:37:42,502 --> 00:37:42,800
Speaker 0: Super strong.

827
00:37:42,860 --> 00:37:48,600
Speaker 0: You know, and it's, it's basically, you mix, you take these urban legends, you know, they're not, I don't know if these are real urban legends.

828
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,899
Speaker 0: I've never heard of them before.

829
00:37:50,262 --> 00:37:53,000
Speaker 0: So it's like they made up a bunch of urban legends for the show.

830
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:56,939
Speaker 0: And then they all have something supernatural in nature and they're all for reals.

831
00:37:57,320 --> 00:38:05,600
Speaker 0: And you have this huge cast of characters like you have in a movie like snatch and they all get mixed up in all sorts of different directions as crazy things happen.

832
00:38:05,660 --> 00:38:08,520
Speaker 0: And you know, there isn't really a quote, main characters.

833
00:38:08,641 --> 00:38:09,840
Speaker 0: Some are more main than others.

834
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:14,280
Speaker 0: Some have the spotlight more than others argued that seltie is the main care.

835
00:38:14,600 --> 00:38:17,000
Speaker 0: It can also be argued that the main character.

836
00:38:18,485 --> 00:38:20,960
Speaker 1: So, or you could argue that there are two main characters.

837
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,460
Speaker 1: The first is seltie because she is like the overarching plot driver.

838
00:38:25,462 --> 00:38:28,639
Speaker 0: She's also the driver of the time, but some of the time she's barely in it.

839
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,500
Speaker 1: But, but she's still like, her story still ties them together in, in many, many ways.

840
00:38:33,647 --> 00:38:33,820
Speaker 0: Yeah.

841
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:40,500
Speaker 1: But the other main character is the, the triumvirate of the three characters.

842
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,860
Speaker 0: Well, there's also right.

843
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:51,460
Speaker 0: Isiah, who is like the bad guy, but he's like always in everyone's business, you know, it's like, no matter which, no matter which of the plots is going on, he's always into it.

844
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,680
Speaker 0: He's got his hands in there.

845
00:38:52,780 --> 00:39:00,820
Speaker 0: So could it be, you know, really, it's like, he's never way in the front, but that's just cause they don't want to reveal all his secrets, but he's always there.

846
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:10,999
Speaker 0: It's like the supporting guy who's, you know, if he's there all the time and all these other main people have a greater spotlight, but they come and go, maybe he's equal to them in, you know, mainness.

847
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:15,720
Speaker 1: But it's a show that moves very quickly sometimes and slowly at other times.

848
00:39:15,841 --> 00:39:19,260
Speaker 1: But the end result is it's not a show that's easily predicted.

849
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:25,446
Speaker 1: You can predict like certain major plot points, like you can with any show, but the show will kind of just story for a loop.

850
00:39:25,466 --> 00:39:28,551
Speaker 1: or they'll ask a question like, what is the secret of the, Oh, it's this.

851
00:39:29,305 --> 00:39:29,657
Speaker 1: Now what?

852
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:35,359
Speaker 0: And the other thing is that there's a lot of times where you know something, but different characters don't know it.

853
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,379
Speaker 0: So it's like, Oh, he knows, I know all these things, but he only knows this subset and he only knows this subset.

854
00:39:40,841 --> 00:39:49,059
Speaker 0: And all, if only these characters would all just tell each other what I know, they all know that they know that the other person doesn't know that they know.

855
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:59,760
Speaker 1: So at the end of the first story arc, there's one big reveal of, Oh, that's not so and so that's so and so I didn't see that one coming.

856
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:07,358
Speaker 1: I did that when that, when that whole reveal happened, basically it comes down to a bunch of people standing around going, what the fuck?

857
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:12,979
Speaker 0: There's pretty much really, there was pretty much only one thing and I predicted it way early and the proof is in the forum.

858
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:19,597
Speaker 0: And did in fact predicted, I predicted it absolutely 100% way early and everything else I didn't predict.

859
00:40:20,742 --> 00:40:23,639
Speaker 0: So I got, I got one, but it was a big one and no one else got it.

860
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,628
Speaker 1: So who should watch the show before?

861
00:40:25,668 --> 00:40:26,653
Speaker 1: we, you know, have a little.

862
00:40:26,713 --> 00:40:31,580
Speaker 0: everybody except except very small children and maybe old people won't like it.

863
00:40:32,002 --> 00:40:35,539
Speaker 1: I think small children would like at least the first season about like two year olds.

864
00:40:36,242 --> 00:40:38,420
Speaker 1: It's pretty and colorful and stuff's going around.

865
00:40:38,540 --> 00:40:39,840
Speaker 0: It's kind of dark stuff's lying around.

866
00:40:40,641 --> 00:40:46,318
Speaker 0: I was like 10 year olds and up from 10 to like, you know, I mean old people should watch it, but they probably won't like it.

867
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:47,774
Speaker 0: So maybe like 10 to 60 year olds.

868
00:40:48,440 --> 00:40:51,100
Speaker 1: I was eight when I saw vampire hunter D and I loved it.

869
00:40:51,762 --> 00:40:55,340
Speaker 1: My little brother was five, five, I don't know.

870
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:55,992
Speaker 1: He loved it.

871
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,079
Speaker 1: Vampire hunter D was the best thing ever when he was five years old.

872
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,439
Speaker 0: Yeah, but I mean, I don't know.

873
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:03,059
Speaker 0: He's going to really understand what's going on when he's five.

874
00:41:04,102 --> 00:41:06,000
Speaker 1: Just colorful, just colors running around.

875
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:06,376
Speaker 0: Okay.

876
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:07,960
Speaker 0: But you can get more colors if you watch Pokemon.

877
00:41:08,621 --> 00:41:11,920
Speaker 0: Or, uh, that's got way too many colors.

878
00:41:12,923 --> 00:41:14,439
Speaker 0: Stick with the Doraemon when you're five.

879
00:41:16,122 --> 00:41:19,079
Speaker 0: In fact, stick with Doraemon until you're like in second, third, second, third grade.

880
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,559
Speaker 1: Just don't watch Doraemon.

881
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,120
Speaker 0: Dude, there's your, there's your mashup.

882
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:29,220
Speaker 1: Yeah.

883
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:34,040
Speaker 1: He just Doraemon shows up and he takes off her helmet and it's just Doraemon.

884
00:41:35,981 --> 00:41:45,679
Speaker 1: So not to spoil anything, but this helicopter straight up and the way the show goes is, you know, there's the first episode and the second episode are really cool and they set up all this stuff.

885
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:48,560
Speaker 1: But then the mystery is who is the headless rider?

886
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:49,257
Speaker 1: What's the deal?

887
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:51,480
Speaker 1: Is she really headless right away?

888
00:41:51,961 --> 00:41:55,920
Speaker 1: They answer that straight up and she is just a character from that point forward.

889
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,180
Speaker 0: It's like, it's like, Ooh, there's a mysterious headless rider.

890
00:41:58,261 --> 00:42:00,179
Speaker 0: Then like w w like episode four or five.

891
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:01,660
Speaker 0: It's like the headless rider.

892
00:42:01,787 --> 00:42:01,934
Speaker 0: Hello.

893
00:42:02,281 --> 00:42:02,798
Speaker 1: She's just cool.

894
00:42:03,022 --> 00:42:04,360
Speaker 0: I'm hanging out in my house.

895
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,298
Speaker 0: I'm the headless rider.

896
00:42:05,641 --> 00:42:06,399
Speaker 1: She's scared of aliens.

897
00:42:06,780 --> 00:42:08,120
Speaker 1: She talks to people with an iPhone.

898
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,030
Speaker 0: Yeah.

899
00:42:09,704 --> 00:42:10,317
Speaker 0: It's like, what's up?

900
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,804
Speaker 0: Someone's like, they don't like, it's not like one of the other characters discovers it.

901
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:14,440
Speaker 0: It's like this.

902
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:18,740
Speaker 0: Suddenly there's an episode just focusing on that character and just reveals all at least reveals most.

903
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:20,480
Speaker 1: And then later someone's like, show me what's under your helmet.

904
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:20,998
Speaker 1: She was like, okay.

905
00:42:21,261 --> 00:42:22,639
Speaker 1: And he's like, Oh, okay, cool.

906
00:42:23,022 --> 00:42:23,558
Speaker 0: All right, let's go.

907
00:42:23,922 --> 00:42:24,860
Speaker 0: I see what's under that helmet.

908
00:42:25,344 --> 00:42:26,219
Speaker 1: I see what you did there.

909
00:42:26,380 --> 00:42:26,532
Speaker 1: Yeah.

910
00:42:27,287 --> 00:42:27,415
Speaker 0: Okay.

911
00:42:27,881 --> 00:42:29,820
Speaker 0: So I don't know how the helmet stays on.

912
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,880
Speaker 0: That's my problem.

913
00:42:31,801 --> 00:42:35,480
Speaker 1: Well, she, her clothes, everything else stays on and half of it was formed by her magic.

914
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:36,760
Speaker 0: That's cause she has a body.

915
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,320
Speaker 1: But she forms her clothes with magic.

916
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:38,620
Speaker 1: Remember?

917
00:42:39,309 --> 00:42:39,560
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

918
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,659
Speaker 1: She makes all those other helmets.

919
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:41,680
Speaker 0: No, that's right.

920
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:41,933
Speaker 1: Yeah.

921
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,360
Speaker 1: That's right.

922
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:43,434
Speaker 0: I forgot about that.

923
00:42:44,145 --> 00:42:44,420
Speaker 0: Magic.

924
00:42:44,600 --> 00:42:45,579
Speaker 0: He has a lot of magic in this show.

925
00:42:46,061 --> 00:42:49,300
Speaker 1: Not as much as you'd think, unless you count the internet as being magic.

926
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:50,479
Speaker 0: The internet is magic.

927
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:56,018
Speaker 1: It's funny cause you know, some characters like Salty has powers straight up and she's a little of the strong guy.

928
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:56,934
Speaker 1: Technically.

929
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:01,018
Speaker 1: It's not so much that he has powers, but she's just kicked so much ass.

930
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:03,460
Speaker 0: It's so awesome.

931
00:43:03,920 --> 00:43:04,477
Speaker 0: Oh my God.

932
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:06,400
Speaker 0: Some awesome people cosplaying issues as well.

933
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:07,520
Speaker 0: And it's actually cool cosplay.

934
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:13,780
Speaker 0: Cause instead of carrying around a big stupid sword, you carry on like a signpost or whatever, or like the railroad sign.

935
00:43:13,880 --> 00:43:16,232
Speaker 0: I saw some guys at Connecticut doing that.

936
00:43:16,272 --> 00:43:17,659
Speaker 0: cosplay is pretty good.

937
00:43:18,320 --> 00:43:24,058
Speaker 1: Plus his, I love his backstory and there's a scene where he gets, I can't spoil it, but it's awesome.

938
00:43:25,365 --> 00:43:26,359
Speaker 1: You should watch this show.

939
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:27,640
Speaker 1: Anyone will like this show.

940
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,040
Speaker 1: It's a cowboy beboppy show.

941
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:36,320
Speaker 1: We're pretty much, it's not quite as good as not in terms of goodness, but in terms of it's fun, it takes you along for a ride.

942
00:43:36,702 --> 00:43:38,539
Speaker 1: It's both serious and funny.

943
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:39,580
Speaker 1: Good start.

944
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:40,340
Speaker 1: Good soundtrack.

945
00:43:40,442 --> 00:43:41,440
Speaker 1: It kind of fades into the background.

946
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,319
Speaker 1: Just accents the point.

947
00:43:42,622 --> 00:43:45,399
Speaker 1: It's no, uh, Yoko Kanno soundtrack, but it's there.

948
00:43:46,542 --> 00:43:48,619
Speaker 1: The openings, the first opener I really, really like.

949
00:43:48,992 --> 00:43:49,118
Speaker 1: Yeah.

950
00:43:49,261 --> 00:43:49,760
Speaker 1: Second opener.

951
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:56,156
Speaker 0: The only thing I can say that's negative about the show really is that it pulls the Prince of nothing right away.

952
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:59,600
Speaker 1: They're like, there's going to be a holy war and the whole series ends.

953
00:43:59,801 --> 00:44:03,000
Speaker 1: And it's basically, we're almost at the holy war.

954
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:05,519
Speaker 0: Well, I think it's because you're only getting two.

955
00:44:05,840 --> 00:44:10,020
Speaker 0: That was the negative thing is you're only getting two of the light novel.

956
00:44:10,182 --> 00:44:12,120
Speaker 0: So you're not getting the whole story.

957
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:19,520
Speaker 0: So even though each individual light novel sort of wraps itself up and at the end of series, you get closure.

958
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,920
Speaker 0: You don't get the full closure because you only have two out of X parts, you know?

959
00:44:26,541 --> 00:44:32,279
Speaker 0: So it's like, if you're watching the star wars, any individual star wars movie stands on its own and has an ending to itself.

960
00:44:32,821 --> 00:44:40,580
Speaker 0: But if you only watch episode four and you don't watch five and six, it's like, well, like we don't get any ending here.

961
00:44:41,702 --> 00:44:56,538
Speaker 1: Look at, uh, you know, the Lord of the rings, the first movie, or much more importantly, if the empire strikes back stands on its own, except as a kid watching that, not having seen like all of the first movie and not knowing there was the third movie, that ending is basically what the fuck?

962
00:44:57,587 --> 00:44:57,859
Speaker 1: Really?

963
00:44:58,824 --> 00:44:59,698
Speaker 1: That's how it ends.

964
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:00,920
Speaker 1: Nothing.

965
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:02,680
Speaker 1: No one won and they just run away.

966
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:03,876
Speaker 0: Cause I know that guy's on.

967
00:45:04,460 --> 00:45:04,549
Speaker 0: Yeah.

968
00:45:08,292 --> 00:45:12,810
Speaker 1: When my dad was like, there's a third movie, you know, Okay.

969
00:45:14,402 --> 00:45:29,419
Speaker 1: But before we move on to a couple of spoilers, I'll say this, the dirt has a plot in the kind of the first 13 episodes or so that resolves itself in a very satisfying way and answers many, but not all of the questions.

970
00:45:30,341 --> 00:45:35,680
Speaker 1: The second season raises a whole different set of questions and answers most of them.

971
00:45:35,860 --> 00:45:41,080
Speaker 0: The first season, you know, relies a lot on the fact that it's introducing all these characters.

972
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:45,239
Speaker 0: So it can make most of the plot being revealing the characters.

973
00:45:46,965 --> 00:45:55,220
Speaker 0: Once all the characters are revealed, the rest of the series is about the conflicts between the characters unfolding and switching and whatnot.

974
00:45:55,541 --> 00:46:03,339
Speaker 1: It works because every character in this show is the short guy wearing a white suit in that Simpsons episode with the Chinese and the Yakuza and all the fighting.

975
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:03,837
Speaker 1: Yep.

976
00:46:04,723 --> 00:46:06,539
Speaker 1: Because every character is kind of just there.

977
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:14,080
Speaker 1: And then they have their moment where you find out how completely crazily bad-ass or scary they are or both bad-ass crazy.

978
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:17,180
Speaker 1: I think my favorite characters are the van people.

979
00:46:18,365 --> 00:46:19,179
Speaker 0: They're pretty good.

980
00:46:19,500 --> 00:46:22,339
Speaker 1: Like all of them together because they compete with Russian sushi.

981
00:46:22,842 --> 00:46:26,900
Speaker 1: I don't know the tasty, the van people are just like, yeah, let's go.

982
00:46:28,583 --> 00:46:30,580
Speaker 0: But then there's the head guy.

983
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:30,934
Speaker 0: What's it?

984
00:46:31,040 --> 00:46:33,240
Speaker 0: I forget his name, but he's just, he's just awesome.

985
00:46:33,367 --> 00:46:33,580
Speaker 0: Right.

986
00:46:33,661 --> 00:46:36,520
Speaker 0: And then there's the two, the Otaku in the back of the van.

987
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,859
Speaker 1: But they're crazy awesome when they want to be.

988
00:46:39,100 --> 00:46:40,599
Speaker 0: But there's the fourth guy in the van.

989
00:46:40,721 --> 00:46:41,219
Speaker 0: It's like, what?

990
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:42,179
Speaker 0: He's just sort of there.

991
00:46:42,260 --> 00:46:43,280
Speaker 1: He's the van driver.

992
00:46:43,700 --> 00:46:43,791
Speaker 0: Yeah.

993
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:45,160
Speaker 0: It's like, what's, I don't know.

994
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:45,798
Speaker 0: I don't get his deal.

995
00:46:46,061 --> 00:46:48,139
Speaker 1: He's the, he's the initial D drive and getaway guy.

996
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:48,673
Speaker 0: Maybe.

997
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:49,310
Speaker 0: I don't know.

998
00:46:50,548 --> 00:46:50,760
Speaker 0: Anyway.

999
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:51,939
Speaker 0: The show is great.

1000
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:57,380
Speaker 1: So we're going to spoil some shit about the first season now, just so we can talk about it to make this worthwhile.

1001
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:59,518
Speaker 1: The people who listen to our preview and already watched the show.

1002
00:47:00,142 --> 00:47:03,680
Speaker 1: So spoilers, spoilers, spoilers.

1003
00:47:05,322 --> 00:47:06,980
Speaker 0: Oh my God, everybody dies.

1004
00:47:07,565 --> 00:47:08,559
Speaker 0: And the show resets.

1005
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:09,160
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1006
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:10,379
Speaker 1: It was all just a fucking dream.

1007
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,180
Speaker 0: So anyway, the thing that I predicted correctly, right.

1008
00:47:13,281 --> 00:47:16,560
Speaker 0: Was that a Mikado is the head of the dollar.

1009
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:17,114
Speaker 1: Yup.

1010
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:20,611
Speaker 1: And that was, it was so obvious because completely normal guy.

1011
00:47:23,405 --> 00:47:23,719
Speaker 0: Right.

1012
00:47:24,081 --> 00:47:27,255
Speaker 0: And you have this whole, during the show, there's always this internet typing going on.

1013
00:47:27,528 --> 00:47:27,760
Speaker 0: Right.

1014
00:47:28,621 --> 00:47:32,700
Speaker 0: And he comes into town and he's totally boring, but there's this dollars thing.

1015
00:47:32,940 --> 00:47:37,039
Speaker 0: And it's like, oh, well, obviously this normal guy, right.

1016
00:47:37,421 --> 00:47:38,940
Speaker 0: There has to be something about him.

1017
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:40,060
Speaker 0: That's crazy secret.

1018
00:47:40,205 --> 00:47:40,380
Speaker 0: Awesome.

1019
00:47:40,481 --> 00:47:42,900
Speaker 0: Just like there is for every other character in the show has a secret.

1020
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:43,260
Speaker 0: Awesome.

1021
00:47:43,743 --> 00:47:45,620
Speaker 0: And he's the only one who doesn't look like he has a secret.

1022
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:46,000
Speaker 0: Awesome.

1023
00:47:46,100 --> 00:47:51,420
Speaker 0: But the only thing in the show that isn't already attached to somebody is the dollars.

1024
00:47:51,562 --> 00:47:52,740
Speaker 0: It's like, well, what's the dollars.

1025
00:47:53,286 --> 00:47:53,837
Speaker 0: It's this thing.

1026
00:47:54,981 --> 00:47:56,380
Speaker 0: Obviously that secret.

1027
00:47:56,583 --> 00:47:56,820
Speaker 0: Awesome.

1028
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:59,980
Speaker 0: That's just sort of unattached attaches to the guy without any secret.

1029
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:00,338
Speaker 0: Awesome.

1030
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,039
Speaker 0: That's, that's just there.

1031
00:48:02,140 --> 00:48:02,957
Speaker 0: That's how it goes.

1032
00:48:04,220 --> 00:48:06,980
Speaker 0: You know, everyone else has something to go with already.

1033
00:48:07,121 --> 00:48:10,039
Speaker 0: That is, you know, already, they're already got their stick.

1034
00:48:10,445 --> 00:48:11,098
Speaker 0: He didn't have a stick.

1035
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:12,519
Speaker 0: There's a stick without a person.

1036
00:48:12,901 --> 00:48:14,620
Speaker 0: The person with no stick stick with a person.

1037
00:48:14,745 --> 00:48:14,894
Speaker 0: Boom.

1038
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:15,460
Speaker 0: Done.

1039
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:19,289
Speaker 1: But also I like how, you know, people all have these kind of powers, whatever they may be.

1040
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:21,579
Speaker 1: And his power is basically.

1041
00:48:22,661 --> 00:48:23,060
Speaker 1: Fortune.

1042
00:48:25,362 --> 00:48:27,620
Speaker 0: It's a good power to have, especially when it actually works.

1043
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,700
Speaker 1: It makes it really interesting the way he used it.

1044
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:36,970
Speaker 1: Like that was the moment when the show went from just being really, really fun to also being like really, really well executed.

1045
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:42,018
Speaker 1: the way he uses the fortune power and the end of that, you know, and then all the reveals happen.

1046
00:48:42,280 --> 00:48:45,540
Speaker 0: But then in the second half of the show, he starts to use it a little more frivolously.

1047
00:48:45,686 --> 00:48:45,979
Speaker 0: Oh yeah.

1048
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:49,559
Speaker 0: Still to great effect, but not like the first time.

1049
00:48:49,821 --> 00:48:56,720
Speaker 1: Well, the first time that moment, just when everyone's looking at their phones and then they all look up and all the people who aren't looking at their phones, they're like, uh.

1050
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:05,559
Speaker 1: It's kind of a, that's the way the world is and is going to be.

1051
00:49:06,547 --> 00:49:06,895
Speaker 0: I hope so.

1052
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:07,536
Speaker 1: Yeah.

1053
00:49:07,940 --> 00:49:08,180
Speaker 1: Fortune.

1054
00:49:09,482 --> 00:49:12,839
Speaker 0: The other thing I thought was really interesting was the whole psycho thing, right?

1055
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:15,680
Speaker 1: It's like that I did not expect.

1056
00:49:15,861 --> 00:49:20,820
Speaker 1: When she got away and I was like, how the fuck did she get away?

1057
00:49:21,081 --> 00:49:23,620
Speaker 1: But I didn't think maybe I should try to figure it out.

1058
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:24,739
Speaker 1: I just thought how the fuck.

1059
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:27,100
Speaker 1: And then when they revealed, oh, duh.

1060
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:27,973
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1061
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:32,430
Speaker 0: But the thing that got me is that it's like, okay, someone's possessed by an evil sword, right?

1062
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:36,480
Speaker 0: But it's like, it's not the typical situation when you have that.

1063
00:49:36,801 --> 00:49:40,100
Speaker 0: Usually when someone's possessed by an evil thing, it's like the one ring, right?

1064
00:49:40,561 --> 00:49:43,240
Speaker 0: This was like, yeah, I got the one ring, but you know what?

1065
00:49:43,544 --> 00:49:44,319
Speaker 0: I got it under control.

1066
00:49:44,485 --> 00:49:44,798
Speaker 0: It's cool.

1067
00:49:45,347 --> 00:49:46,300
Speaker 0: And it totally is cool.

1068
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:50,540
Speaker 0: Like she's, she's got it, but she's not, you know, going crazy or stabbing people.

1069
00:49:51,481 --> 00:49:56,493
Speaker 0: You know, it was only someone else who had a problem that became all crazy toward the end.

1070
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,419
Speaker 1: She starts using it semi-frivolously too.

1071
00:49:58,829 --> 00:49:58,980
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1072
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:06,655
Speaker 0: But they, they show you the contrast between the slasher and her of like, yeah, this is what usually happens when there's someone possessed by an evil weapon.

1073
00:50:06,696 --> 00:50:10,497
Speaker 0: and here's how our person upset possessed by an evil weapon is going to be right.

1074
00:50:11,224 --> 00:50:11,457
Speaker 0: You know?

1075
00:50:11,902 --> 00:50:15,398
Speaker 0: And it's like, ah, I'd like to think that if I was possessed by an evil weapon, I'll be more like that.

1076
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,020
Speaker 0: You know, I wouldn't be all just like crazy, stabbing everybody.

1077
00:50:18,441 --> 00:50:37,200
Speaker 1: So I guess the last thing before we end the show, cause we've gone on long enough toward the end when in case someone's still listening, I'm not going to say who, but anyone who knows knows when someone gets fucking shot at the end of an episode, the fact that, and now I'm spoiling in the next episode, they don't address it for a while.

1078
00:50:37,542 --> 00:50:39,820
Speaker 1: And then the fucker just kind of wanders into the scene.

1079
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:41,078
Speaker 1: He's like, someone shot me.

1080
00:50:41,504 --> 00:50:42,179
Speaker 0: What the hell?

1081
00:50:42,780 --> 00:50:43,438
Speaker 1: I walked here.

1082
00:50:44,213 --> 00:50:44,360
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1083
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:45,859
Speaker 0: I thought he was, I thought he was done.

1084
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:46,919
Speaker 1: I thought he was done too.

1085
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:50,120
Speaker 0: And I was, I was upset because I was an awesome character.

1086
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,080
Speaker 0: I wanted to stick around.

1087
00:50:51,180 --> 00:50:55,200
Speaker 0: But then when he came back, I was also sort of upset that it was not a for real death.

1088
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:58,100
Speaker 1: I was also happy because that was fucking hilarious.

1089
00:50:58,580 --> 00:51:02,080
Speaker 1: That was, it was really like, like epic, like crazy scene.

1090
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:03,580
Speaker 1: Like someone got shot.

1091
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:04,660
Speaker 1: Things really got escalated.

1092
00:51:04,982 --> 00:51:07,379
Speaker 1: And then he just comes in and he's just so bad ass.

1093
00:51:07,640 --> 00:51:10,220
Speaker 0: The thing is guns are always a much bigger deal in Japan.

1094
00:51:10,365 --> 00:51:10,759
Speaker 0: Real ones.

1095
00:51:11,020 --> 00:51:13,140
Speaker 0: Anyway, then they are in the, you know, in us media.

1096
00:51:13,461 --> 00:51:20,513
Speaker 0: It's like when you see a gun coming out and like, you know, an anime that takes place in what's supposedly modern Japan, shit, you know, daughter dies.

1097
00:51:22,540 --> 00:51:25,159
Speaker 1: So Sasa in the movie, nobody has a gun.

1098
00:51:26,123 --> 00:51:27,560
Speaker 0: And they're all, it's a cop movie.

1099
00:51:27,680 --> 00:51:35,639
Speaker 1: I remember the scene where I forget if it was the first movie or maybe it was the rainbow bridge where that crazy person has a gun and none of the police have a gun.

1100
00:51:36,150 --> 00:51:36,297
Speaker 0: Nope.

1101
00:51:36,742 --> 00:51:39,173
Speaker 0: And then, you know, there's the, the, the big scene and those.

1102
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:41,200
Speaker 0: that is a fricking stabbing, right?

1103
00:51:41,281 --> 00:51:41,979
Speaker 0: It's like, Oh shit.

1104
00:51:42,180 --> 00:51:42,553
Speaker 0: A knife.

1105
00:51:43,081 --> 00:51:43,814
Speaker 0: Ah, Hey.

1106
00:51:44,241 --> 00:51:44,432
Speaker 0: Yeah.

1107
00:51:44,660 --> 00:51:47,000
Speaker 1: So it was better than one knife tuna.

1108
00:51:47,830 --> 00:51:48,037
Speaker 1: Oh yeah.

1109
00:51:49,087 --> 00:51:49,620
Speaker 1: I think we're done.

1110
00:51:49,661 --> 00:51:50,393
Speaker 1: We can wrap this up.

1111
00:51:51,184 --> 00:51:51,999
Speaker 0: You should watch the show.

1112
00:51:52,100 --> 00:51:53,680
Speaker 0: It's I think it's still free on crunchy roll.

1113
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:57,940
Speaker 0: There's going to be some sort of OAV like epilogue.

1114
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,080
Speaker 0: That's going to come out, which is like, Oh really?

1115
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,440
Speaker 0: Cause I guess that means that they're not going to do the remaining.

1116
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:03,918
Speaker 1: I think they will.

1117
00:52:04,101 --> 00:52:06,300
Speaker 1: I think maybe they'll just do OAVs for a while.

1118
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:06,778
Speaker 1: We'll see.

1119
00:52:07,106 --> 00:52:07,396
Speaker 0: I don't know.

1120
00:52:07,824 --> 00:52:08,400
Speaker 1: It's hard to tell.

1121
00:52:08,440 --> 00:52:09,837
Speaker 1: I don't know what the sales are like.

1122
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:14,080
Speaker 0: I'm more looking forward to just the guy directing more different animes.

1123
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,320
Speaker 0: Cause I can, you know, I can get the light novels for this, right?

1124
00:52:16,620 --> 00:52:17,900
Speaker 0: But also find the rest of the story.

1125
00:52:18,260 --> 00:52:20,160
Speaker 1: If you haven't watched it, watch Baccano.

1126
00:52:20,221 --> 00:52:22,220
Speaker 1: If you like Dora, you'll like Baccano and the other way around.

1127
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:23,420
Speaker 0: But I still didn't finish Baccano.

1128
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:24,560
Speaker 0: I only watched a handful episodes.

1129
00:52:24,740 --> 00:52:26,800
Speaker 1: I've seen all, but like the last three episodes.

1130
00:52:27,160 --> 00:52:27,418
Speaker 0: Oh, right.

1131
00:52:27,582 --> 00:52:28,080
Speaker 0: I thought you saw it all.

1132
00:52:28,420 --> 00:52:29,479
Speaker 1: It's fricking awesome.

1133
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:32,556
Speaker 0: I've only watched like a hand, like three or four and I've got to, I've just got to go forward.

1134
00:52:32,721 --> 00:52:37,120
Speaker 1: It is a lot more violent than Dora Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara Rara.

1135
00:52:43,461 --> 00:52:45,600
Speaker 1: This has been Geek Nights with Rim and Scott.
