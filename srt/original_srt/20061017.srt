1
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,051
Speaker 1: It's Tuesday October 17th, and this is geek nights tonight.

2
00:00:13,071 --> 00:00:16,720
Speaker 1: We come out of our funk to bring you Japanese style versus puzzle games.

3
00:00:18,542 --> 00:00:19,557
Speaker 0: Let's do this.

4
00:00:21,161 --> 00:00:28,360
Speaker 1: The sad fact about yesterday's show is that we did a much better show after the show while we were laying around talking.

5
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:31,551
Speaker 0: Well, I guess it's cuz we weren't being informative.

6
00:00:31,591 --> 00:00:45,139
Speaker 0: We were just laying around talking which is I think Getting the idea from listening to a lot of podcasts and from listening to our podcast that the entertaining bit is when People are just laying around talking and not trying too hard.

7
00:00:46,043 --> 00:00:46,726
Speaker 1: Well, it depends.

8
00:00:46,826 --> 00:00:49,236
Speaker 1: I mean sometimes we've been informative and it's awesome.

9
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:52,580
Speaker 1: I Think it was a combination of the topic and whatever.

10
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,400
Speaker 1: But anyway, today is a much better day for today.

11
00:00:55,802 --> 00:01:02,689
Speaker 0: If you if you show me a show that has never had a bad episode I mean, come on, seriously, even the greatest shows.

12
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,060
Speaker 0: there's a bad episode of cowboy bebop that one with the aliens.

13
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:07,529
Speaker 0: It wasn't so hot.

14
00:01:07,549 --> 00:01:08,494
Speaker 1: It was fine.

15
00:01:08,515 --> 00:01:09,340
Speaker 1: What are you talking about?

16
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:13,131
Speaker 0: So you get the point is that we don't have to make every episode amazing.

17
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:13,553
Speaker 1: Yeah, we do.

18
00:01:14,215 --> 00:01:14,977
Speaker 0: All right, whatever.

19
00:01:15,298 --> 00:01:23,176
Speaker 1: more importantly I would like to point out because a lot of people seem to have noticed that the episode didn't appear properly in the feed last night.

20
00:01:24,043 --> 00:01:25,249
Speaker 1: Yeah, all Scott.

21
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:35,107
Speaker 1: Yeah, I forgot to attach the category I just want to note because the one time a while ago when I went to sleep without dealing with the show properly Scott raised holy hellfire about it.

22
00:01:35,688 --> 00:01:38,376
Speaker 1: Yeah, so, uh, I just had to bring that up.

23
00:01:38,637 --> 00:01:41,571
Speaker 1: Okay, that's all I'm not gonna rag on him because I've done it before now.

24
00:01:41,591 --> 00:01:42,858
Speaker 1: We're in a level playing field again.

25
00:01:43,341 --> 00:01:44,204
Speaker 0: I know you screw up.

26
00:01:44,244 --> 00:01:45,248
Speaker 0: I can rag on you again.

27
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:47,778
Speaker 1: Yeah until you screw up and then we're even again.

28
00:01:47,798 --> 00:01:48,300
Speaker 1: exactly.

29
00:01:48,563 --> 00:01:49,656
Speaker 0: So you're the only gets rag done.

30
00:01:51,305 --> 00:01:51,998
Speaker 0: Cuz all your fault.

31
00:01:53,061 --> 00:01:58,948
Speaker 1: Anyway more importantly we mentioned yesterday Probably my favorite thing ever now.

32
00:01:59,028 --> 00:01:59,991
Speaker 1: I know I say that a lot.

33
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,736
Speaker 1: But this is this is particularly special.

34
00:02:02,238 --> 00:02:03,000
Speaker 1: my man scrote's.

35
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:15,016
Speaker 0: Okay, so you're hanging out over the weekend and our friend was showing us this game magic pencil magic Pendul a game that now like a year to have.

36
00:02:15,056 --> 00:02:19,932
Speaker 1: two years ago He says I got this awesome game that you need to see for the ps2.

37
00:02:20,453 --> 00:02:21,777
Speaker 1: I'll bring it when I visit.

38
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:22,840
Speaker 1: he visited.

39
00:02:23,226 --> 00:02:24,059
Speaker 1: He brought the game.

40
00:02:24,481 --> 00:02:27,630
Speaker 1: He did not bring a PlayStation 2 and none of us owned one.

41
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:30,960
Speaker 1: Oh, well, he says he'll bring it to Otakon.

42
00:02:31,622 --> 00:02:34,049
Speaker 1: With the ps2 forgets the ps2.

43
00:02:34,691 --> 00:02:37,860
Speaker 1: we go somewhere where we have a ps2 forgets the game.

44
00:02:38,623 --> 00:02:40,532
Speaker 0: He basically failed to show us this game forever.

45
00:02:40,593 --> 00:02:41,919
Speaker 0: So finally we go to his house.

46
00:02:42,785 --> 00:02:44,579
Speaker 0: So he shows us the game now.

47
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:52,720
Speaker 0: The way the game was described to me is that I thought you drew some sort of two-dimensional Monster and then it came to life and fought other monsters.

48
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,054
Speaker 1: Apparently you draw a three-dimensional monster.

49
00:02:56,094 --> 00:03:01,416
Speaker 0: three-dimensional monster But it's not quite as freeform as I had imagined.

50
00:03:01,496 --> 00:03:02,480
Speaker 0: but you can do a lot.

51
00:03:02,701 --> 00:03:04,210
Speaker 1: It's very freeform.

52
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:05,820
Speaker 1: You can do a lot of things.

53
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:10,217
Speaker 0: It's not as free as I hoped but it was still very free because what you hoped for was impossible.

54
00:03:10,237 --> 00:03:12,145
Speaker 1: with that level of Technology, I guess.

55
00:03:12,366 --> 00:03:16,099
Speaker 0: but where's the ps2 supposed to be able to control icvms with nukes on them?

56
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:23,465
Speaker 1: Um Scott we got to the moon as the United States with something less powerful than my TI 85 Calculator before I overclocked it.

57
00:03:23,826 --> 00:03:25,792
Speaker 0: I know but remember when they could.

58
00:03:25,852 --> 00:03:27,437
Speaker 0: they didn't want Saddam to get ps2s.

59
00:03:27,477 --> 00:03:32,110
Speaker 1: Yeah You know what that brought back a whole bunch of sad memories.

60
00:03:32,631 --> 00:03:39,496
Speaker 1: Yeah, but anyway, yeah for all of our political leanings Clinton was awesome, but those weren't the best president's years.

61
00:03:39,657 --> 00:03:46,298
Speaker 0: I'll say that anyway, so He finally shows us this game and he shows us all the cool monsters.

62
00:03:46,338 --> 00:03:46,720
Speaker 0: He's made.

63
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:52,319
Speaker 0: He's got like Godzilla looking thing and uh, no, there's a thing that looks like the big monsters from Nausicaa.

64
00:03:52,722 --> 00:03:53,608
Speaker 1: Yeah, he made some.

65
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:54,636
Speaker 1: really he made a monster.

66
00:03:54,656 --> 00:03:55,180
Speaker 1: That was himself.

67
00:03:56,121 --> 00:04:00,344
Speaker 1: Yeah, now the thing is the monsters look pretty cool but they were alright.

68
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:07,744
Speaker 1: and then he showed us how you draw a monster and the monsters he drawn became a Billion times more impressive.

69
00:04:07,784 --> 00:04:13,580
Speaker 1: because I can't imagine doing something like that in 3d with an analog thumb nub.

70
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:17,510
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean if there was a study this game needs a DS for real.

71
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:21,279
Speaker 0: cuz on the ps2 you're really limited by the interface.

72
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,280
Speaker 1: Yeah, this game on the DS would make gangbusters.

73
00:04:26,322 --> 00:04:27,680
Speaker 0: Anyway, it would go gangbusters.

74
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:31,213
Speaker 0: He starts to draw a new monster to show us what a drawing a new monster is like.

75
00:04:31,314 --> 00:04:37,496
Speaker 0: he draws a blob with blob feet And blob arms and a blob head and we're like what the hell aren't you gonna draw like a penis?

76
00:04:37,837 --> 00:04:38,520
Speaker 0: and he?

77
00:04:39,242 --> 00:04:43,640
Speaker 0: In all the time of owning this game for years never drew a penis, can you believe that?

78
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,000
Speaker 0: That would be the first thing that any reasonable person would draw.

79
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:51,034
Speaker 1: Yeah I mean the DS proved to the world and I started a new thing.

80
00:04:51,054 --> 00:04:55,749
Speaker 1: where if you are given an Electronic media where in you can draw something.

81
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:59,660
Speaker 1: the first thing any human being will draw is a penis.

82
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:02,010
Speaker 1: If you do not draw a penis you were not a human being.

83
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:08,480
Speaker 0: even Gabe who draws day in and day out You know goes up in front of a class of little kids teaches them how to draw a funny cartoon.

84
00:05:08,621 --> 00:05:09,808
Speaker 0: And what is the first urge?

85
00:05:09,948 --> 00:05:11,880
Speaker 0: don't drop penis don't drop penis don't drop penis.

86
00:05:13,221 --> 00:05:19,778
Speaker 1: So now I will note though that he didn't really play the game a lot since the DS came out and the DS was really the beginning of that trend.

87
00:05:20,564 --> 00:05:23,540
Speaker 1: Yeah, I guess it was because I mean before then there was the cock boat.

88
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,260
Speaker 1: But other than that, I didn't really draw penises on a regular basis.

89
00:05:26,883 --> 00:05:31,865
Speaker 1: I've drawn more penises since the DS came out and then the rest of my life combined That is true.

90
00:05:31,905 --> 00:05:36,600
Speaker 1: Yeah, including the 11 to 14 year old years, which are key for penis drawing.

91
00:05:37,543 --> 00:05:38,746
Speaker 0: They are indeed the era.

92
00:05:38,826 --> 00:05:43,360
Speaker 0: in fact most penises is drawn but in our times there wasn't so much penis drawing.

93
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:46,193
Speaker 0: There was a lot more stick figure with boobs drawing going on.

94
00:05:46,253 --> 00:05:46,614
Speaker 1: Really?

95
00:05:46,775 --> 00:05:49,553
Speaker 0: Yeah, at least in my town No one could really draw.

96
00:05:49,654 --> 00:05:50,480
Speaker 1: there wasn't much drawing.

97
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,070
Speaker 1: The thing we would always do is we draw stick figure wars.

98
00:05:53,331 --> 00:05:58,715
Speaker 1: you draw like a thousand stick men with white heads Fighting a thousand stick men with blackheads and they all had guns.

99
00:05:59,016 --> 00:05:59,740
Speaker 0: Well, that was racist.

100
00:06:00,202 --> 00:06:01,005
Speaker 1: See it wasn't.

101
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:08,320
Speaker 1: so much racism is that we couldn't draw and the only way we could differentiate Stickman was to color in the head or not color in the head anyway.

102
00:06:09,422 --> 00:06:13,639
Speaker 0: So he finally drew a penis in this game made a penis monster.

103
00:06:13,779 --> 00:06:27,589
Speaker 1: now Not only did he draw a penis but the whole room the whole front row crew who was there is sitting around Directing him like make the shaft longer make the head a different color make the balls brown and gnarly put some wrinkles on him Get some veins in there.

104
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:36,617
Speaker 0: in the end I thought it was done, but they continued to add a bunch of scraggly nasty hair And some varicose veins of varying color.

105
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:39,536
Speaker 1: now I'll note that every now and then he could go into this thing.

106
00:06:39,557 --> 00:06:53,780
Speaker 1: that would show you a rough idea of how it would look when it was walking when it was dancing when it was attacking when it was sad and When once it was mostly complete and he sets it to the dancing thing Scott who was staring at the screen?

107
00:06:54,121 --> 00:07:01,639
Speaker 1: Rapturously the entire time with rapt attention says oh Yeah, oh, yeah.

108
00:07:02,603 --> 00:07:03,827
Speaker 0: It wasn't oh, yeah like that.

109
00:07:03,907 --> 00:07:06,556
Speaker 0: It was oh, yeah, like oh, yeah, it's awesome.

110
00:07:06,637 --> 00:07:07,580
Speaker 0: It was freaking awesome.

111
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:09,530
Speaker 1: It was more of a oh, yeah.

112
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:11,320
Speaker 0: No, yeah was no.

113
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:13,853
Speaker 0: Considering it was it was like Kool-Aid.

114
00:07:13,994 --> 00:07:22,931
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah No Because after you said that the entire room turns and looks at you there is exactly eight seconds of silence And then we all died roughly.

115
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:24,400
Speaker 0: What does that say about you guys?

116
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,740
Speaker 1: That we figured something out about your personal life, and it was hilarious.

117
00:07:29,822 --> 00:07:32,380
Speaker 0: But I think it's awesome when there's a hilarious dancing penis.

118
00:07:33,341 --> 00:07:39,400
Speaker 1: So we finally start playing the game and it just gets worse because first of all he names it scrotch in the game.

119
00:07:40,022 --> 00:07:40,845
Speaker 0: It was a perfect name.

120
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:45,040
Speaker 1: I suggested testicles, you know a nice regal Roman sounding name king testicles.

121
00:07:45,374 --> 00:07:47,724
Speaker 1: But testicles croats was good.

122
00:07:48,005 --> 00:08:05,649
Speaker 1: and scrotch comes out and then this little girl comes out with her monster to fight our Monster and this little girl's monsters this little stuffed animal and the stuffed animal like runs over and bats at the penis and does a little bit of damage and then scrotch rears up and Does a horrible motion.

123
00:08:05,669 --> 00:08:15,502
Speaker 0: it's think of M bison psycho crusher You know turns horizontal flies through the air and bangs into the enemy only it's a headbutt in a in a in a penis Sort of way.

124
00:08:16,084 --> 00:08:21,221
Speaker 1: it just leans down and BAM or it'll do a nice spin where it kind of whips the testicles around and hits It.

125
00:08:21,684 --> 00:08:22,529
Speaker 0: yeah, it'll.

126
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:31,580
Speaker 0: it'll spin around really rapidly You know just with the testicles Sort of like a helicopter blade only on the bottom and then whack the bad guy a few times with the nuts.

127
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:40,220
Speaker 1: Because the worst thing was that as the final touch at Kate's request They added a little bit of stretchy spooge kind of hanging down from the tip.

128
00:08:40,684 --> 00:08:44,868
Speaker 0: That was kind of nasty Unnecessary if you ask me gratuitous.

129
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,000
Speaker 0: one might say yeah, it definitely made it look uglier.

130
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:49,691
Speaker 0: I mean it looks so nice and pristine.

131
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,060
Speaker 0: before they added some of that shit.

132
00:08:51,181 --> 00:08:52,551
Speaker 1: I gotta say it was a little disturbing.

133
00:08:52,591 --> 00:08:55,306
Speaker 1: when he goes into the pasture You know where he keeps all his monsters.

134
00:08:55,386 --> 00:08:55,868
Speaker 1: you see it.

135
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:58,840
Speaker 1: Just kind of frolicking in the grass and bounding around.

136
00:08:59,842 --> 00:09:01,319
Speaker 0: Yeah, it was rather unpleasant.

137
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:03,669
Speaker 1: That is the story of scrotch.

138
00:09:03,769 --> 00:09:09,179
Speaker 1: I I implore Nintendo or anyone to make a game like that for the DS.

139
00:09:09,199 --> 00:09:21,706
Speaker 0: I Think the lesson learned is if you have a game that lets you draw a penis There's really no two ways around that now, it's really hard to avoid Alright news time.

140
00:09:21,987 --> 00:09:22,429
Speaker 0: Yeah, okay.

141
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,312
Speaker 1: We got some news.

142
00:09:23,774 --> 00:09:25,440
Speaker 0: so my news there.

143
00:09:25,661 --> 00:09:33,216
Speaker 0: You may not know this, but there's something called DS homebrew, and it's this whole Sorta.

144
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:39,839
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's this group of people and this technology that allows you to do things with your Nintendo DS.

145
00:09:39,899 --> 00:09:42,029
Speaker 0: besides What Nintendo expects you to do with it?

146
00:09:42,109 --> 00:09:42,552
Speaker 1: Hey Scott?

147
00:09:42,652 --> 00:09:44,180
Speaker 1: Is it a witch's home?

148
00:09:45,943 --> 00:09:48,029
Speaker 0: No, it is not a witch's homebrew.

149
00:09:48,269 --> 00:09:51,838
Speaker 0: I got another question is it about which is homebrew?

150
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:56,216
Speaker 1: no maybe anyway style.

151
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:07,440
Speaker 0: So Basically what people would do is they would use the original was the pass me device You know which would allow you to take code from your computer and play it on your DS.

152
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:21,240
Speaker 0: But then they went on and they got better things like the m3 And you know they got different kinds that they put like flash cartridges in the GBA slot And they'd put like boot cartridges in the DS slot that would stick out of your DS.

153
00:10:21,421 --> 00:10:25,040
Speaker 0: None of these things were very elegant and none of them were elegant solutions.

154
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:31,736
Speaker 0: You know they would work, and you could play NES roms SNES roms GBA roms DS roms.

155
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,616
Speaker 0: You could also do a lot of software written for the DS by just people.

156
00:10:37,038 --> 00:10:40,273
Speaker 0: you know I mean There's a. there's a comic reading software for the DS.

157
00:10:40,293 --> 00:10:41,620
Speaker 0: You could read comics on that thing.

158
00:10:41,841 --> 00:10:43,780
Speaker 0: They're mp3 players all sorts of stuff.

159
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:51,787
Speaker 1: I gotta say the only reason I didn't get into it was that I never heard someone who had one have anything Particularly glowing to say about the one they had.

160
00:10:51,807 --> 00:10:57,080
Speaker 0: I mean there were some people who would flash the DS itself to replace the firm.

161
00:10:57,362 --> 00:10:58,250
Speaker 1: I'm gonna happen.

162
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:07,478
Speaker 0: if there was a guy I saw a video of him doing it and if I had that guy do it for me I would have said okay, but I'm not gonna try that myself see.

163
00:11:07,518 --> 00:11:16,460
Speaker 1: the last time I did anything like that was when I modded my ps1 with a six-pin mod chip Mmm, and I I can't solder anymore.

164
00:11:16,621 --> 00:11:18,569
Speaker 1: I used to solder stuff all the time as a kid.

165
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:21,100
Speaker 1: I you know circuits and stuff and I was playing around with electronics.

166
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,726
Speaker 1: I was in science Olympiad.

167
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:25,274
Speaker 1: I can't solder anymore soldering that mod chip.

168
00:11:25,315 --> 00:11:26,880
Speaker 1: I burned myself like nine times.

169
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,808
Speaker 0: Yeah, I've also lost that skill mostly.

170
00:11:29,029 --> 00:11:30,415
Speaker 0: I gotta get it back.

171
00:11:30,515 --> 00:11:31,640
Speaker 1: It's not that useful anymore.

172
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,029
Speaker 1: It's easier just to buy a new.

173
00:11:33,089 --> 00:11:34,759
Speaker 1: whatever thing broke that you're trying to fix.

174
00:11:35,402 --> 00:11:36,967
Speaker 0: Yeah, but what if you're trying to make something new?

175
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:42,560
Speaker 1: I buy an IC or mod something anyway You get a mod chip the sticks on the outside.

176
00:11:42,728 --> 00:11:49,967
Speaker 0: Yeah There are flash me's and past me's and all this dreck that you had to deal with and it was all Expensive and confusing and nothing was perfect.

177
00:11:50,629 --> 00:11:50,950
Speaker 0: now.

178
00:11:51,030 --> 00:12:01,336
Speaker 0: There is a new thing called the DS - X dream and This is as pretty much as close as we're gonna get to perfection now.

179
00:12:01,456 --> 00:12:02,440
Speaker 0: It's a bit expensive.

180
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:04,459
Speaker 0: It's like over a hundred bucks for this thing.

181
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:05,784
Speaker 0: But what it is?

182
00:12:05,804 --> 00:12:37,540
Speaker 0: it's a DS cartridge that has a little tiny USB connector at the top so you can plug it into your computer and inside of this flash cartridge DS cartridge is 512 megabytes or 4 gigabits of flash memory and In that flash memory you can put DS roms mp3s And it's got a cool little you know menu system.

183
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,603
Speaker 0: so you could.

184
00:12:38,643 --> 00:12:42,655
Speaker 0: you know a big DS ROM usually is only about 30 megabytes.

185
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:52,240
Speaker 0: so you can put a whole lot of DS roms inside this one DS cartridge and Put it in your DS and then choose in the menu which DS game you want to play.

186
00:12:52,802 --> 00:12:56,580
Speaker 0: The best thing is that this fully supports, you know one cartridge play.

187
00:12:57,042 --> 00:13:00,599
Speaker 0: So if you have a ROM of say Mario Kart you can play it with.

188
00:13:00,699 --> 00:13:03,231
Speaker 0: you know All your friends even if they don't have Mario Kart.

189
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:11,757
Speaker 0: and pretty much these guys Tested a whole bunch of different games and the only game that didn't work right was Pokemon diamond from Japan.

190
00:13:12,279 --> 00:13:28,022
Speaker 1: Oh well Yeah, I got to say if I actually jump on this boat and get some sort of play roms on my DS Nintendo and a lot of other companies are going to lose a lot of money because I bought bionic commando for $20.

191
00:13:28,022 --> 00:13:38,540
Speaker 1: If I could just play my ROM collection on my DS that is my roms Minus the roms that suck times $20 that they're losing and I'll say right now that I'll pirate them and I'll do that.

192
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:39,880
Speaker 1: And that's the end of that question.

193
00:13:40,021 --> 00:13:44,280
Speaker 0: Yeah, the way I figured out if you want to play NES SNES.

194
00:13:44,340 --> 00:14:06,179
Speaker 0: Well, not SNES doesn't work so well but NES, you know GBA type roms you have to do is get one of these programs for your computer and You take that program and you take say an NES ROM and you feed it into the program and the program will spit out a Nintendo DS ROM of the NES game and you load that onto the cartridge to get it to play.

195
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:08,170
Speaker 0: and That's how these things kind of work.

196
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:12,149
Speaker 0: but DS doom Supposedly works even though one guy couldn't get it to work.

197
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:13,895
Speaker 0: Everyone else could scum.

198
00:14:14,016 --> 00:14:17,719
Speaker 0: VM DS works So you can play monkey island on your DS of this thing.

199
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:22,720
Speaker 0: Oh Yeah, this is this is a hot thing.

200
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:29,420
Speaker 1: you see This wouldn't be an issue if these companies would all have to embrace the DS and brought out all these games that now we're pirating.

201
00:14:30,301 --> 00:14:36,080
Speaker 0: I know why the problem is is that you know, the DS can play GBA and DS games.

202
00:14:36,321 --> 00:14:41,360
Speaker 0: So I'm if I get one of these I'm not gonna be using it to play GBA and DS games.

203
00:14:41,461 --> 00:14:42,146
Speaker 0: Oh my DS.

204
00:14:42,347 --> 00:14:44,140
Speaker 0: if I want to do that, I'll just buy the game.

205
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,422
Speaker 0: It's.

206
00:14:44,442 --> 00:14:49,508
Speaker 0: you know, I don't need to pirate that even though some you know I could understand 13 year old kids with no money doing that.

207
00:14:49,548 --> 00:14:51,093
Speaker 0: I'll excuse them me.

208
00:14:51,234 --> 00:14:51,876
Speaker 0: What do I care?

209
00:14:51,876 --> 00:14:52,057
Speaker 0: $30 DS game?

210
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,570
Speaker 0: It's not like there's so many DS games.

211
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:56,381
Speaker 0: I already have every DS game I want.

212
00:14:56,421 --> 00:15:05,208
Speaker 1: wouldn't need to pirate one for but like imagine if Sierra had just taken all the police quest space quest quest for glory games And put him out on the DS.

213
00:15:05,389 --> 00:15:06,373
Speaker 0: I would have bought them all.

214
00:15:06,695 --> 00:15:07,800
Speaker 0: but no they're not doing that.

215
00:15:08,483 --> 00:15:24,729
Speaker 0: And you know while I can get a lot of these games on my computer, you know I'm using Linux and we got a Mac downstairs and you know While I can emulate the games there or perhaps get the original versions there or get an actual like old NES out and play the old games.

216
00:15:25,031 --> 00:15:27,100
Speaker 0: It's so much effort and it's not portable.

217
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:30,772
Speaker 0: If I got an NES game, I want to play it portably, you know.

218
00:15:31,113 --> 00:15:32,720
Speaker 0: and rim look he's willing to pay for it.

219
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:34,899
Speaker 0: He just bought bionic commando for the GBA.

220
00:15:35,128 --> 00:15:42,539
Speaker 1: Yeah but Strider counts as negative money as far as I'm concerned and mighty final fight is a pretty much useless game.

221
00:15:43,604 --> 00:15:44,749
Speaker 0: It's worth it to play one time.

222
00:15:44,990 --> 00:15:46,919
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah one time I've ever I already played it.

223
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:54,020
Speaker 1: Yep before I bought this game I played it again to remind myself that the game involves drop kick drop kick drop kick drop kick drop kick drop kick.

224
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:54,622
Speaker 1: That's how you win.

225
00:15:54,964 --> 00:15:55,646
Speaker 1: Yep right now.

226
00:15:55,727 --> 00:15:56,710
Speaker 1: I just spoiled the game.

227
00:15:56,991 --> 00:15:59,019
Speaker 1: if you drop kick everyone you can't lose.

228
00:16:00,441 --> 00:16:09,130
Speaker 0: but anyway, the point is is that this is awesome new cart that you can buy and You put it in your DS and you can.

229
00:16:09,572 --> 00:16:16,178
Speaker 0: your DS basically becomes this Programmable portable computer that can do all sorts of awesome things that it's not meant to do.

230
00:16:16,499 --> 00:16:18,447
Speaker 1: isn't James or someone gonna get this?

231
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:20,615
Speaker 0: Yeah, I'm gonna convince someone to get it.

232
00:16:20,836 --> 00:16:22,806
Speaker 0: now that I figured out You know how it works.

233
00:16:22,967 --> 00:16:25,080
Speaker 1: We've often used James as our testbed for things.

234
00:16:25,207 --> 00:16:31,927
Speaker 0: Yeah I'm using him as the testbed for this department because he's a lot more interested in it than I am because he wants to program Some DS software.

235
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:32,732
Speaker 1: we do too.

236
00:16:32,812 --> 00:16:34,683
Speaker 1: We just don't have time I know.

237
00:16:34,703 --> 00:16:35,205
Speaker 0: I know.

238
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:37,777
Speaker 1: remember when we tried to get a DS dev kit Nintendo laughed at us.

239
00:16:38,119 --> 00:16:39,808
Speaker 0: Yeah Well now who's laughing?

240
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:43,946
Speaker 0: now, I'm gonna get one for a hundred bucks and change You know Def Con.

241
00:16:44,588 --> 00:16:46,374
Speaker 1: Yeah Def Con on the DS.

242
00:16:47,076 --> 00:16:47,597
Speaker 0: Oh shit.

243
00:16:47,818 --> 00:16:51,608
Speaker 1: That would be Wow, I wonder if he thought of that.

244
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:52,732
Speaker 0: I don't know.

245
00:16:53,174 --> 00:16:56,788
Speaker 1: I'm gonna email him and just say hey Did you consider putting Def Con on the DS?

246
00:16:57,249 --> 00:17:00,000
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'll just fill the rest of the email with dollar signs.

247
00:17:03,344 --> 00:17:14,415
Speaker 1: All right speaking of dollar signs brand theft auto for You know, there's it's gonna have all these high-res polygons You know, I just got to say something real quick about Grand Theft Auto.

248
00:17:14,457 --> 00:17:19,520
Speaker 0: a great I played Grand Theft Auto 1 and in its day on the PC on DOS.

249
00:17:20,002 --> 00:17:33,095
Speaker 0: That was a fun game and then I played the expansions for Grand Theft Auto London Which is the same game only it was a little bit more fun because they said funny British things and the cars are cool And London was a lot more fun to drive around.

250
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:33,700
Speaker 1: Why is that?

251
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:36,329
Speaker 1: Why is it that British accents make things cooler at us in the

252
00:17:36,409 --> 00:17:36,791
Speaker 1: u.s.?

253
00:17:37,172 --> 00:17:39,279
Speaker 0: I don't know but the Austin Powers car was wicked cool.

254
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:40,518
Speaker 0: anyway.

255
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:46,680
Speaker 0: GTA 2 came out and it was basically the same game only they changed it.

256
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:51,220
Speaker 0: It was darker and it was like it was just it wasn't good.

257
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:54,980
Speaker 0: They had like these gang wars and crap and they added all this extra crap to the game.

258
00:17:55,060 --> 00:18:02,300
Speaker 0: It was no longer simply run around, you know for fun driving and running over people, you know, it got kind of bleh.

259
00:18:03,221 --> 00:18:07,283
Speaker 0: GTA 3 I played it once and I was like, oh well, this isn't the game It used to be.

260
00:18:07,303 --> 00:18:10,420
Speaker 0: screw this shit, but yet somehow it's the most popular game.

261
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,563
Speaker 1: See, I enjoyed it because it was.

262
00:18:11,704 --> 00:18:14,692
Speaker 1: it was the first widely known sandbox kind of.

263
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:17,480
Speaker 1: here's the world interact with it game.

264
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,105
Speaker 0: But GTA 1 was like that.

265
00:18:19,165 --> 00:18:29,599
Speaker 0: GTA 3 was like a worse game, but they made it 3d without, you know It's like the game itself was 3d But it was the same as the 2d game only not

266
00:18:29,659 --> 00:18:34,196
Speaker 1: really Because the world was a lot more immersive being 3d and having better graphics and the way the game was.

267
00:18:34,256 --> 00:18:36,162
Speaker 1: it was more immersive and you Could do more.

268
00:18:36,182 --> 00:18:37,747
Speaker 0: Hey, not much more.

269
00:18:37,847 --> 00:18:38,871
Speaker 1: Yeah quite a bit more.

270
00:18:38,891 --> 00:18:40,034
Speaker 0: you shot people.

271
00:18:40,074 --> 00:18:41,960
Speaker 0: you beat people up your random over with cars.

272
00:18:42,262 --> 00:18:44,537
Speaker 1: Yeah, it was a lot more fun to me in the 3d.

273
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,867
Speaker 1: But then again, I played the 3d.

274
00:18:47,168 --> 00:18:49,858
Speaker 1: exactly how long I could have enjoyed that about two hours.

275
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:51,464
Speaker 0: Yeah I actually beat.

276
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,011
Speaker 0: you know GTA 1.

277
00:18:53,011 --> 00:18:53,253
Speaker 0: Yeah.

278
00:18:53,514 --> 00:18:54,679
Speaker 1: But anyway, that's not my point.

279
00:18:54,779 --> 00:18:55,665
Speaker 1: Yeah I don't care at all.

280
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:59,748
Speaker 1: People are allowed to enjoy grind theft auto Mm-hmm captain.

281
00:19:00,089 --> 00:19:02,840

282
00:19:03,202 --> 00:19:04,047
Speaker 0: Yeah, exactly.

283
00:19:04,067 --> 00:19:06,200
Speaker 0: If I don't like it, I'm gonna say it sucks.

284
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:06,663
Speaker 0: That's how.

285
00:19:06,744 --> 00:19:08,980
Speaker 0: that's what people say things suck when they don't like them.

286
00:19:09,227 --> 00:19:22,640
Speaker 1: No, no Cuz you always go the step further and say and you're wasting your time and you're stupid and you are Except you I recall last week would come home from work and play Sonic the fucking Hedgehog like - Sonic the Hedgehog 2 was awesome.

Speaker 1: anyway.

289
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:31,382
Speaker 1: now Grand Theft Auto 4 is gonna be coming out for the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.

290
00:19:31,382 --> 00:19:41,000
Speaker 1: No kidding, but they had announced a while ago There's going to be exclusive content on the Xbox 360. if you get that version of the game you get extra.

291
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:51,999
Speaker 1: Now the news here is not a hundred percent verified yet, but they've got a source who they call source And I don't if whether it's true or not is not the issue.

292
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:55,369
Speaker 1: But this sort of thing has been happening a lot lately.

293
00:19:55,409 --> 00:20:07,383
Speaker 1: The rumor is and I'll give it about a 75% chance being true Grand Theft Auto 4 is going to have alternate exclusive content for the PlayStation 3 release Uh-huh.

294
00:20:07,644 --> 00:20:18,939
Speaker 1: So it's kind of like when Soul Calibur 3 or 2 2 was released on three system I'm just gonna say that and each one, you know one had link had someone else one had someone else.

295
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:20,779
Speaker 1: You can tell which one I cared about.

296
00:20:21,081 --> 00:20:26,120
Speaker 0: Yeah, and much most people cared about because apparently the GameCube was the most popular Soul Calibur 2 platform.

297
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,210
Speaker 1: Yeah to anyone who thought the GameCube didn't do well.

298
00:20:28,451 --> 00:20:34,918
Speaker 1: I mean it outsold the Xbox worldwide and Soul Calibur 2 for the GameCube sold more than either for the other ones.

299
00:20:34,938 --> 00:20:35,280
Speaker 1: I don't know.

300
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:42,365
Speaker 0: I think the ps2 sold more possibly but I think that like at tournaments and stuff people always played the GameCube one.

301
00:20:42,566 --> 00:20:49,200
Speaker 1: Well part of the thing remember it's kind of founding issues there I mean the GameCube one looked better because the PlayStation 2 was really kind of at the end of its life.

302
00:20:49,562 --> 00:20:52,940
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, it's still at the end of its life, but games are still coming out for it.

303
00:20:53,121 --> 00:20:54,853
Speaker 1: Yeah, and I'll bet games will keep coming out for it.

304
00:20:55,074 --> 00:20:55,900
Speaker 0: Yep for a while now.

305
00:20:56,021 --> 00:20:58,940
Speaker 1: What's bothered me now is that a lot lately people are saying?

306
00:20:59,240 --> 00:21:02,834
Speaker 1: Oh, this game is exclusive for three months and three months later.

307
00:21:02,855 --> 00:21:10,100
Speaker 1: It comes out on another platform Yep, and I guess it seems like such a dishonest and crappy business practice.

308
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:11,319
Speaker 1: But yet people fall for it.

309
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:17,900
Speaker 1: There are people who buy a console because of an exclusive game even though the game will come out for another console later.

310
00:21:18,405 --> 00:21:22,608
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean that's the number one thing I use if I'm deciding on what console to buy.

311
00:21:22,628 --> 00:21:25,717
Speaker 0: my number one decision factor is the exclusive games.

312
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:36,973
Speaker 0: because you know If there's a game that's gonna come out for the ps3 the Xbox 360 and the computer Well, and I really want the game then I'm gonna get the computer.

313
00:21:37,013 --> 00:21:37,996
Speaker 0: Why should I buy a console?

314
00:21:38,016 --> 00:21:39,440
Speaker 0: I have a computer, you know.

315
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,780
Speaker 0: So it all comes down to okay.

316
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:49,200
Speaker 0: If I'm gonna buy a console it has to have a lot of games that I need that console in order to play.

317
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:57,920
Speaker 0: you know that are games that I must play that I can't live without playing somehow and You know Nintendo always seems to have the exclusives.

318
00:21:57,940 --> 00:22:02,000
Speaker 0: You're not gonna see Zelda hunt anywhere else and you know, you're not gonna see it anywhere else.

319
00:22:08,751 --> 00:22:10,367
Speaker 1: things of the day.

320
00:22:10,387 --> 00:22:14,021
Speaker 0: I Had another thing of the day planned, but it got.

321
00:22:14,282 --> 00:22:19,830
Speaker 0: I'm gonna push it back to tomorrow because My brother informed me I had a more important thing of the day to use.

322
00:22:20,131 --> 00:22:25,592
Speaker 1: See the thing is I could totally preempt your thing of the day now because I'm the one who found it and showed it to You.

323
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:27,810
Speaker 1: I build it up for a whole day.

324
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:31,084
Speaker 1: I was like I got this awesome thing and when you see it, you're gonna go.

325
00:22:31,706 --> 00:22:32,530
Speaker 0: it's my thing of the day.

326
00:22:32,610 --> 00:22:33,375
Speaker 0: I got dibs.

327
00:22:33,455 --> 00:22:35,990
Speaker 0: I called dibs and I'm gonna do it tomorrow.

328
00:22:36,413 --> 00:22:36,856
Speaker 1: But if what?

329
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:38,810
Speaker 1: if I do it today, you could still do it tomorrow.

330
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:41,373
Speaker 1: No Why not?

331
00:22:41,755 --> 00:22:42,981
Speaker 0: because it's already been done.

332
00:22:43,001 --> 00:22:45,090
Speaker 0: We never duplicate things of the day unless we forget.

333
00:22:45,391 --> 00:22:49,030
Speaker 1: Well, if I do it today, then it would be your choice to duplicate it tomorrow.

334
00:22:49,931 --> 00:22:50,795
Speaker 0: I already got dibs.

335
00:22:50,896 --> 00:22:53,286
Speaker 0: if you violate dibs, there will be consequences.

336
00:22:53,587 --> 00:23:03,085
Speaker 1: All right, fine I'll just say that Scott's thing of the day involves Batman Hey and Super Mario Brothers - stop giving away my things of the day.

337
00:23:03,105 --> 00:23:03,186
Speaker 0: Yeah.

338
00:23:03,467 --> 00:23:06,400
Speaker 1: Yeah All right, you can give my things of the day away.

339
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,848
Speaker 0: I forget everything that it is.

340
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:08,230
Speaker 0: Really?

341
00:23:08,591 --> 00:23:09,234
Speaker 0: Yeah, what is it?

342
00:23:09,575 --> 00:23:13,310
Speaker 1: All right, so there's this game a little flash game that came.

343
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:16,520
Speaker 1: Oh, yeah I can't remember now and Scott pointed me to it after.

344
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:20,075
Speaker 1: well first he starts playing in his room and I hear him because whatever He wants attention.

345
00:23:20,738 --> 00:23:22,728
Speaker 1: He'll talk really loudly in his room hoping I'll walk in.

346
00:23:23,796 --> 00:23:32,153
Speaker 1: So I hear oh a game huh, oh Fuck fuck Fuck this game.

347
00:23:32,414 --> 00:23:37,794
Speaker 1: and he runs into my room and says you got to try this game and and you tried that game this game It's just.

348
00:23:37,895 --> 00:23:40,210
Speaker 1: you know those games where you got a little cursor and you get contribute.

349
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:42,730
Speaker 1: Basically, you have a block that follows your mouse cursor.

350
00:23:43,131 --> 00:23:47,247
Speaker 1: You have to move it around an obstacle course without touching anything and get it to a goal.

351
00:23:47,548 --> 00:23:48,010
Speaker 1: No big deal.

352
00:23:49,651 --> 00:23:51,055
Speaker 1: This one reverses your mouse.

353
00:23:51,176 --> 00:23:52,299
Speaker 1: up is down left is right.

354
00:23:53,162 --> 00:23:54,606
Speaker 0: It really sucks in.

355
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:55,750
Speaker 0: it really sucks.

356
00:23:56,031 --> 00:24:02,130
Speaker 1: Now I got to level 19 and I stopped only because it was late and we had to do the show.

357
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:04,759
Speaker 0: It was indeed level 19.

358
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:05,301
Speaker 0: I saw it.

359
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:09,012
Speaker 1: we're not lying now this game Will.

360
00:24:09,374 --> 00:24:12,130
Speaker 1: it's painful to watch someone else play it.

361
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:20,069
Speaker 1: It's painful to be more painful to play it because when you lose it makes this noise And you just and it's like shock therapy.

362
00:24:21,272 --> 00:24:25,166
Speaker 0: It really is just so irritating to even be near this game.

363
00:24:25,186 --> 00:24:28,410
Speaker 1: now something interesting Is that after I played the first two levels?

364
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:33,070
Speaker 1: I got really really really good at it And now I can just sit down and get back to level 19 in about five minutes.

365
00:24:33,191 --> 00:24:36,163
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, it's really a matter of patience it beating the game.

366
00:24:36,424 --> 00:24:37,710
Speaker 1: No, it's a matter of muscle memory.

367
00:24:38,032 --> 00:24:42,597
Speaker 1: If you play it for like an a half hour or so You can just use a backwards mouse.

368
00:24:42,637 --> 00:24:42,898
Speaker 1: fine.

369
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:43,059
Speaker 1: Now.

370
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:45,249
Speaker 1: I can just use a backwards mouse without even thinking about it.

371
00:24:45,853 --> 00:24:47,669
Speaker 0: Yeah, yeah, but I mean anyone can do that.

372
00:24:47,810 --> 00:24:49,217
Speaker 0: So it's just patience.

373
00:24:49,277 --> 00:24:51,246
Speaker 0: and are you gonna sit there and build that skill?

374
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,860
Speaker 0: and once you do It's just how long are you gonna spend playing before you win?

375
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,325
Speaker 1: I think the skill is permanent.

376
00:24:57,108 --> 00:24:57,569
Speaker 0: I don't know.

377
00:24:58,014 --> 00:24:59,030
Speaker 1: I'm gonna a week from now.

378
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:04,112
Speaker 1: I'm gonna try to play the game cuz just now I played the game and I literally went level one two three four five six Seven eight.

379
00:25:04,132 --> 00:25:06,824
Speaker 1: without even trying I could just move the mouse around backwards.

380
00:25:06,844 --> 00:25:07,467
Speaker 1: Uh-huh.

381
00:25:08,553 --> 00:25:14,605
Speaker 1: However, I'm not to get to that point I had to play the game for over a half hour yesterday and got fucking damn.

382
00:25:14,706 --> 00:25:15,409
Speaker 0: Was that worth it?

383
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,754
Speaker 1: Yeah, I think it was.

384
00:25:16,774 --> 00:25:18,260
Speaker 1: All right, and you know what?

385
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:22,932
Speaker 1: It's more worth it than learning to type into for ack Haha.

386
00:25:23,234 --> 00:25:23,555
Speaker 1: All right.

387
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:25,222

391
00:25:40,951 --> 00:25:43,885

00:25:45,151 --> 00:25:47,440
Speaker 0: It is indeed the unluckiest day of the year now.

393
00:25:47,801 --> 00:25:48,122
Speaker 1: Luckily.

Speaker 0: in fact he's the unlucky beast like.

410
00:26:47,437 --> 00:26:53,890
Speaker 0: he was born on Tuesday the 17th and he has webbed toes and They basically really make fun of superstitions.

411
00:26:54,311 --> 00:27:01,658
Speaker 0: but they they're also true in the episode where people get hit with lightning because they do something unlucky and It's pretty hilarious.

412
00:27:02,443 --> 00:27:03,488
Speaker 0: and today's Tuesday the 17th.

413
00:27:04,771 --> 00:27:08,287
Speaker 0: My brother used to think he was born on Tuesday the 17th because he was born on a 17th.

414
00:27:09,510 --> 00:27:12,222
Speaker 0: But I just checked and he was born on Monday the 17th.

415
00:27:12,564 --> 00:27:13,186
Speaker 1: Whoa lucky.

416
00:27:13,448 --> 00:27:18,785
Speaker 1: Yeah Well, if he hadn't been lucky he would have been born on this Tuesday the 17th exactly.

417
00:27:19,448 --> 00:27:22,256
Speaker 0: just to clarify Superstitions are all bullshit.

418
00:27:22,296 --> 00:27:25,706
Speaker 1: Yeah, except apparently throwing salt over your shoulders.

419
00:27:26,187 --> 00:27:29,108
Speaker 0: It's not a superstition It's a. it's a ritual just like pen says.

420
00:27:32,453 --> 00:27:41,950
Speaker 1: I won't bring it up in too detail now because I don't want to go long in the episode But I recall you getting quite perturbed at one point when we prevented you from throwing the salt over your shoulder.

421
00:27:42,071 --> 00:27:44,068
Speaker 0: You got rituals you do like what?

422
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:45,694
Speaker 1: Stuff like what?

423
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:46,518
Speaker 1: I'm curious.

424
00:27:47,141 --> 00:27:48,970
Speaker 1: I'm not denying it, but I'd like to hear some evidence.

425
00:27:50,713 --> 00:27:52,590
Speaker 0: What are some of rims ritual?

426
00:27:53,550 --> 00:27:56,594
Speaker 1: Ha Scott can't come up with anything Besides.

427
00:27:56,976 --> 00:28:05,456
Speaker 1: Scott is the one who was so anti Religion spirituality philosophy anything and getting through salt over his shoulder to keep the demons away It's not to keep the demons away.

428
00:28:05,476 --> 00:28:08,909
Speaker 0: There's nothing wrong with doing things as long as you don't, you know.

429
00:28:09,371 --> 00:28:16,490
Speaker 1: Well, I'll note that the reason you gave us for many years that you did it was quote because otherwise something bad will happen.

430
00:28:16,812 --> 00:28:17,818
Speaker 0: No, I didn't say that.

431
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,409
Speaker 0: Yes, you did said something will happen.

432
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:23,133
Speaker 0: Okay Something will happen.

433
00:28:23,194 --> 00:28:24,177
Speaker 0: something always happens.

Speaker 0: something's happening right now Who knows.

435
00:28:26,252 --> 00:28:29,589
Speaker 1: so it's okay to make a pedantic kind of BS argument like that.

436
00:28:30,412 --> 00:28:35,305
Speaker 0: It's okay to have a meaningless ritual if it's not harmful.

437
00:28:35,365 --> 00:28:37,010
Speaker 1: World of Warcraft is a meaningless ritual.

438
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:37,632
Speaker 0: Oh, it's not.

439
00:28:37,692 --> 00:28:38,855
Speaker 0: that takes way too much time.

440
00:28:38,995 --> 00:28:42,966
Speaker 0: Why if all right, if you're ritual because you're wasting salts?

441
00:28:43,447 --> 00:28:44,530
Speaker 0: salt is wasting salt.

442
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:46,175
Speaker 1: You're also making a mess.

443
00:28:46,476 --> 00:28:47,639
Speaker 0: that's not harmful either.

444
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:50,949
Speaker 0: the salt you make things clean right whatever?

445
00:28:51,009 --> 00:28:58,477
Speaker 1: today We're going to talk about Japanese versus puzzle games because over the weekend We didn't bring any board games to the northern geek house.

446
00:28:58,979 --> 00:29:05,018
Speaker 1: We pretty much just played video games hung out and drank a little Yep, and we watched one movie, but I slept.

447
00:29:05,340 --> 00:29:06,424
Speaker 1: Yeah, it wasn't that good a movie.

448
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:07,307
Speaker 1: I was really disappointed.

449
00:29:07,729 --> 00:29:08,780
Speaker 0: Oh good I'm glad I slept.

450
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:19,869
Speaker 1: Yeah For reference the movie was all the Queen's Men, which would have been a useless movie But it had Eddie Izzard in it and it had some really good lines, but the movie was overall kind of met all right.

451
00:29:20,652 --> 00:29:25,914
Speaker 0: Anyway for those of you don't realize you know we play Tetris in this country And I think we play.

452
00:29:25,934 --> 00:29:26,415
Speaker 0: what are the games?

453
00:29:26,435 --> 00:29:26,897
Speaker 0: they play?

454
00:29:26,937 --> 00:29:38,969
Speaker 0: bejeweled and you know all those puzzle games were stuff falls from the top And you guide it to the bottom or stuff falls from the top and you kind of move stuff around to arrange it in a better fashion.

455
00:29:38,989 --> 00:29:48,050
Speaker 0: and And Well in Japan there's a lot more of those that we never get to see or They get turned into something else before they come over to this country.

456
00:29:48,431 --> 00:29:58,381
Speaker 1: Not only that just the whole genre of that a versus style puzzle game for things fall from the sky and time as a factor Is really more advanced over there?

457
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:03,016
Speaker 0: Yeah, if you try to play like for example Cardcaptor Sakura Tetris.

458
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:06,189
Speaker 0: right you play this thing on the PlayStation in Japan.

459
00:30:06,369 --> 00:30:09,581
Speaker 0: now It's Tetris only it has Cardcaptor Sakura on it.

460
00:30:09,721 --> 00:30:10,022
Speaker 0: Okay.

461
00:30:10,123 --> 00:30:11,929
Speaker 0: It has a nice theme very nice.

462
00:30:12,572 --> 00:30:31,850
Speaker 0: however, if you play versus mode you actually choose a character and Depending on which character you choose when you do damage to the opponent your character will do damage in a different pattern Based on the character you choose and some characters are actually better than others and drop more dangerous patterns on the enemy.

463
00:30:32,433 --> 00:30:35,910
Speaker 0: You know you ever play some good examples or in the u.s.

464
00:30:36,010 --> 00:30:40,489
Speaker 0: Would be super puzzle fighter where your street fighter guy does attacks to the other side.

465
00:30:41,334 --> 00:30:43,649
Speaker 0: Only imagine the character mattering a lot more.

466
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:46,195
Speaker 0: Japan has a lot of games like this.

467
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:51,370
Speaker 1: yeah, basically I would say that these games aren't so much puzzle games as they are fighting games.

468
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:53,219
Speaker 1: They're just abstract fighting games.

469
00:30:53,521 --> 00:30:55,270
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess you could look at it that way.

470
00:30:55,432 --> 00:30:56,589
Speaker 0: You know it's a fighting game.

471
00:30:56,951 --> 00:31:00,970
Speaker 0: We know cuz reflexes and control of the gamepad matter just as much.

472
00:31:01,732 --> 00:31:05,563
Speaker 0: Only it's more about quick thinking and it's sort of like you know.

473
00:31:05,623 --> 00:31:09,938
Speaker 0: you solve your puzzle in a way That you know causes an attack.

474
00:31:09,998 --> 00:31:27,182
Speaker 0: so instead of just pushing a button to make an attack happen You sort of build an attack on in your board and then unleash it at the critical moment while your opponent might unleash attacks on you which you know mess up your board and Defeat your ability to release attacks.

475
00:31:27,282 --> 00:31:32,108
Speaker 1: now normally we talk about how awesome We are at things, but we're not the old-school masters of these games.

476
00:31:32,148 --> 00:31:44,020
Speaker 1: in fact I had never seen these games until I got to RIT and at the RIT Anime Club social nights I saw a lot of people older than me playing these games Very quickly and very well.

477
00:31:44,261 --> 00:31:46,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, we suck relatively speaking.

478
00:31:46,390 --> 00:31:51,649
Speaker 0: I mean I could probably beat most of the listeners until oh wait a way to throw down my.

479
00:31:52,232 --> 00:31:54,821
Speaker 0: Okay, I mean the listeners who?

480
00:31:55,021 --> 00:31:56,105
Speaker 0: because who else is there this?

481
00:31:56,125 --> 00:31:57,510
Speaker 0: meet you me and the listeners, right?

482
00:31:58,073 --> 00:32:05,563
Speaker 0: So I could buy beat most listeners who never played the game before But I imagine a lot of them would advance their skill rapidly and thwart us.

483
00:32:05,683 --> 00:32:07,047
Speaker 1: see like we'll be.

484
00:32:07,067 --> 00:32:09,917
Speaker 1: watch our friend Adam And our friends go Joe play the game right.

485
00:32:10,058 --> 00:32:12,547
Speaker 0: they would kick our ass every time watching them play each other.

486
00:32:12,588 --> 00:32:14,556
Speaker 1: the game looks really Easy, and they're just throwing stuff around.

487
00:32:14,596 --> 00:32:16,003
Speaker 1: throwing stuff around throwing stuff around.

488
00:32:16,043 --> 00:32:17,550
Speaker 1: then five minutes later someone dies.

489
00:32:18,193 --> 00:32:21,069
Speaker 1: So then I sit down next to him like Adam, and I play.

490
00:32:21,089 --> 00:32:25,271
Speaker 1: I Died within 11 seconds, yeah I'm like.

491
00:32:25,653 --> 00:32:30,590
Speaker 0: I'm thinking this game is completely unfair because I have no chance to do anything at all.

492
00:32:30,811 --> 00:32:31,152
Speaker 0: I'm like.

493
00:32:31,413 --> 00:32:32,518
Speaker 0: this is just bullshit.

494
00:32:32,558 --> 00:32:33,462
Speaker 0: screw this game.

495
00:32:33,542 --> 00:32:34,265
Speaker 0: It's not worth it.

496
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:37,340
Speaker 1: so one of the games We play this weekend was magical drop.

497
00:32:37,923 --> 00:32:39,330
Speaker 0: magical drop is a classic.

498
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:44,856
Speaker 0: I think they're actually newer ones like magical drop F or magical drop J Or s. I don't know the letters.

499
00:32:45,137 --> 00:32:46,041
Speaker 1: the games are that.

500
00:32:46,161 --> 00:32:47,406
Speaker 1: the gameplay is very simple.

501
00:32:47,767 --> 00:32:48,169
Speaker 1: you can.

502
00:32:48,912 --> 00:32:54,809
Speaker 1: Gems of different color are coming down in pad in square patterns from the sky, and they're basically it's like Tetris upside down.

503
00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:01,701
Speaker 0: Yep, like this is bored growing on top of you, and you can think of it like Stalag tights coming down from the ceiling.

504
00:33:02,084 --> 00:33:06,495
Speaker 1: yeah because remember Stalagmites might hang from the ceiling But they don't right.

505
00:33:06,535 --> 00:33:10,350
Speaker 0: and you're this little jester and the jester is at the bottom of the screen.

506
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:11,538
Speaker 1: see I don't think you're the jester.

507
00:33:11,578 --> 00:33:19,250
Speaker 1: I think you are the Ranging between cute and slightly edgy girl standing in the background of the jester is your minion?

508
00:33:20,311 --> 00:33:26,130
Speaker 0: Okay, you could put it that way, but anyway you control the jester and the jester can do two things.

509
00:33:26,572 --> 00:33:38,030
Speaker 0: He can pull balls from the top of the screen into notes Yeah into his hands skirt And he can take all the balls in his hands skirts and toss them up to the top of the screen.

510
00:33:38,030 --> 00:33:39,384
Speaker 0: Those are the two things he can do.

511
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:49,343
Speaker 1: now There's different colors, and the goal is to get what three four four in a row I think for a number in a row vertically of one color.

512
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:57,629
Speaker 1: if you cause that to happen then Every gemmy of that color touching those will disappear in addition to those mm-hmm.

513
00:33:58,331 --> 00:34:01,583
Speaker 0: So let's say there's a horizontal row of blue balls.

514
00:34:02,004 --> 00:34:06,340
Speaker 0: you you go to the far left You pick up you pull the blue ball down into your hand.

515
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,909
Speaker 0: you go right you pull down another blue ball.

516
00:34:09,273 --> 00:34:14,246
Speaker 0: You go to the right you take the two blue balls You're holding and throw them to the top of the screen.

517
00:34:14,348 --> 00:34:17,686
Speaker 0: now You've got three blue balls in one vertical column.

518
00:34:17,726 --> 00:34:22,925
Speaker 0: they disappear But they're touching this horizontal row of blue balls that are still remaining.

519
00:34:23,025 --> 00:34:24,109
Speaker 0: all those disappear as well.

520
00:34:24,391 --> 00:34:29,859
Speaker 1: Yeah, because if blue balls are touching a horizontal row of blue balls That's the best way to get rid of blue balls of course.

521
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:33,406
Speaker 0: now the problem is you can only hold one color ball at the same time.

522
00:34:35,311 --> 00:34:40,429
Speaker 0: So if you're holding a blue ball you can't pull down a yellow ball or a green ball.

523
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:43,833
Speaker 1: So if you see you know you can say there's five blue balls You can grab.

524
00:34:43,853 --> 00:34:45,099
Speaker 1: you go grab grab grab grab.

525
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:47,010
Speaker 1: then you throw them all in one spot and make them all go away.

526
00:34:47,050 --> 00:34:51,370
Speaker 0: You got to toss up the blue balls before you can grab the green balls, and there's other things.

527
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:52,996
Speaker 1: I mean depending on what character you are.

528
00:34:53,016 --> 00:35:03,575
Speaker 1: because every time you make things go away or get combos it drops Bad things on the other person's screen the little slimes with eyeballs, and they will know that's battle That's a different game.

529
00:35:03,595 --> 00:35:03,857
Speaker 0: All right.

530
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:04,582
Speaker 1: That's battle balls.

531
00:35:04,643 --> 00:35:08,290
Speaker 0: I'm thinking wrong game Yeah, drops ice cubes and all sorts of other nasty.

532
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:11,681
Speaker 1: It just drops other stuff on the other guy's screen does damage them.

533
00:35:11,721 --> 00:35:14,189
Speaker 1: the pattern of the damage depends on what character you play.

534
00:35:14,290 --> 00:35:17,801
Speaker 0: for Example one character does a lot of damage in the middle.

535
00:35:18,223 --> 00:35:33,609
Speaker 0: so if you want to defeat this character You're gonna have to have a strategy where you take balls from the middle and put them on the sides Or else the middle row is gonna get really long and come down and stab you right away When the sides are gonna be really shallow and not near killing you.

536
00:35:34,172 --> 00:35:37,746
Speaker 1: I'll note that if you've never played these games before it doesn't matter.

537
00:35:37,806 --> 00:35:38,549
Speaker 1: You'll just lose.

538
00:35:38,971 --> 00:35:45,924
Speaker 1: Basically yeah unless I mean when Scott and I played against each other was fine because we both really sucked and the game actually Was playable hmm?

539
00:35:46,591 --> 00:35:51,920
Speaker 0: Well, I think what makes the games interesting in general is that if you play something like Tetris It's the same every time.

540
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,349
Speaker 0: it's who's gonna play Tetris better.

541
00:35:53,912 --> 00:36:04,790
Speaker 0: but these characters while they might unbalance the game at points and What they do is they force the the other the opponent to change up how they play the game in order to win.

542
00:36:05,652 --> 00:36:21,028
Speaker 0: You know if I play the game in a certain way all the time and you use a different character it drastically changes the pattern of the pieces I have to play with and I'm forced to completely change my Strategy or lose unless you don't know what you're doing in which case it doesn't matter okay.

543
00:36:21,068 --> 00:36:23,650
Speaker 0: the other game We played was battle balls.

544
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:28,278
Speaker 1: Right after we Generated and played with throats for about an hour.

545
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:34,790
Speaker 0: right now my first playing a battle balls I was playing against someone is really good, and I couldn't do anything.

546
00:36:34,891 --> 00:36:44,289
Speaker 0: So I thought the game was complete crap and useless And I was right about some of that and not so right about some of that You know, but it wasn't as impossible as I thought it was.

547
00:36:44,952 --> 00:36:48,844
Speaker 0: But it's still a little bit annoying and a little bit luck-based at points.

548
00:36:48,964 --> 00:36:53,480
Speaker 1: my experience with the game was thus I have a little triangle of balls falling all right.

549
00:36:53,561 --> 00:36:54,545
Speaker 1: I'll let him fall somewhere.

550
00:36:54,826 --> 00:36:56,554
Speaker 1: Oh look they rolled out They spread out.

551
00:36:56,916 --> 00:36:57,620
Speaker 1: Oh another set.

552
00:36:57,881 --> 00:36:58,062
Speaker 1: who?

553
00:36:58,123 --> 00:36:59,329
Speaker 1: I can get those colors to line up.

554
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:01,842
Speaker 1: Hey, it didn't fall where I wanted it to do.

555
00:37:02,164 --> 00:37:02,767
Speaker 1: what the fuck.

556
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:03,209
Speaker 1: I'm dead.

557
00:37:04,097 --> 00:37:07,237
Speaker 0: Yeah, see the problem with this game Is that you have these balls.

558
00:37:07,498 --> 00:37:10,490
Speaker 0: then they come down in sets of three and they're different colors.

559
00:37:11,092 --> 00:37:18,436
Speaker 0: And if you can you know you put them down and if any of them are kind of not balanced properly They'll fall down.

560
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:21,249
Speaker 0: and you know roll around until they land somewhere.

561
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:22,697
Speaker 0: yep Yep, so think of it.

562
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:26,135
Speaker 0: like you know you're taking a bunch of pebbles in your hand And you just let go of them.

563
00:37:26,597 --> 00:37:29,328
Speaker 0: you know some of them land on top of the pile and stay there.

564
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,768
Speaker 0: some of them roll down the sides.

565
00:37:32,110 --> 00:37:49,578
Speaker 0: Now if you match up enough balls of the right color touching each other they disappear And that causes the balls on top of them to fall down which in turn Hopefully will make another set of colored balls that will disappear and cause a chain reaction Eventually doing extreme damage to the opponent.

566
00:37:49,980 --> 00:37:57,524
Speaker 1: the goal of experienced players seems to be to Set up a giant combo build and build and build and build and build and build and build.

567
00:37:58,066 --> 00:38:01,115
Speaker 1: and then it's kind of a Bringsmanship thing where both people are building.

568
00:38:02,018 --> 00:38:12,510
Speaker 1: if you set off a combo and the other person sets off a combo while you're doing it To counter your combo They basically end up doing more damage to you than you do to them because they counter it and then they counter attack.

569
00:38:12,571 --> 00:38:16,290
Speaker 0: Yeah, the timing has a lot to do with it Which is why you know we did say it's more.

570
00:38:16,493 --> 00:38:22,050
Speaker 0: It's a lot like a fighting game And you know I mean normally the combo the other guy did would have just done a whole bunch of damage.

571
00:38:22,171 --> 00:38:26,109
Speaker 0: You know if you play Tetris if I get a Tetris and rim gets a Tetris it evens out.

572
00:38:26,591 --> 00:38:30,181
Speaker 0: Imagine if the timing of when you set off the Tetris caused.

573
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:34,234
Speaker 0: you know the guy who does it at the right moment actually does More damage to the opponent.

574
00:38:34,836 --> 00:38:42,201
Speaker 0: it adds this whole other level to the game instead of just putting the things in the right places But putting them in the right places at the right time.

575
00:38:42,241 --> 00:38:44,529
Speaker 0: sometimes you want to go slow sometimes you want to go fast.

576
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:46,790
Speaker 1: now This is the game that has that horrible damage thing.

577
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:57,496
Speaker 1: Damage seems to come in the in the form of little slimies that fall into your board and any time They come across one of your balls They grab it and turn that color.

578
00:38:57,977 --> 00:39:02,090
Speaker 1: now they count as walk that color and you can destroy them by destroying normal balls next to.

579
00:39:03,013 --> 00:39:04,437
Speaker 1: But you can't destroy them on their own.

580
00:39:04,818 --> 00:39:09,907
Speaker 1: and furthermore when you destroy them the slime goes away and the ball They originally were remains.

581
00:39:10,752 --> 00:39:16,650
Speaker 0: Yeah, so you basically have two kinds of balls this the colored balls and there's colored balls with eyeballs.

582
00:39:17,312 --> 00:39:19,498
Speaker 0: And if it has eyeballs that's not good.

583
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:23,049
Speaker 0: and when you get damaged you bet your screen basically fills up with eyeballs.

584
00:39:23,189 --> 00:39:51,410
Speaker 0: normally There's only a few eyeballs on your screen But when you get damaged there's a lot of eyeballs on your screen a whole lot of eyeballs And you can't get rid of an eyeball unless you match up some non eyeballs on top of them and Often playing against a good opponent They'll fill your screen with eyeballs to the point where you have no room on top of the eyeballs to make any matches whatsoever Unless you're really really lucky and the pieces that you get you know don't have any eyeballs in them.

585
00:39:51,952 --> 00:39:58,448
Speaker 0: And then all the other opponent has to do is you know let's say I'm near the top of the screen but I can still make a match and clear the whole screen away.

586
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:02,403
Speaker 0: I Put down a piece then he drops a few more eyeballs on me.

587
00:40:02,644 --> 00:40:02,945
Speaker 0: I'm done.

588
00:40:03,126 --> 00:40:05,193
Speaker 0: There's no way I can win That's it.

589
00:40:05,675 --> 00:40:06,499
Speaker 0: There's eyeballs there.

590
00:40:06,519 --> 00:40:07,424
Speaker 0: There's no way to get rid of them.

591
00:40:07,444 --> 00:40:08,449
Speaker 0: There's no room game over.

592
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:09,871
Speaker 0: and That's.

593
00:40:09,891 --> 00:40:15,270
Speaker 0: what kind of bothered me is that it felt like you know when you weren't dead you were dead anyway.

594
00:40:15,832 --> 00:40:21,750
Speaker 0: And I really don't think a game should have that situation where you know if I have lost it should be game over.

595
00:40:22,071 --> 00:40:25,410
Speaker 0: You know it's kind of annoying when it's game over, but it's not game over yet.

596
00:40:25,611 --> 00:40:36,170
Speaker 0: I disagree in this game because one that situation lasts about five seconds It does But it's still annoying and I go through this five seconds of time where I'm trying to save myself.

597
00:40:36,713 --> 00:40:37,397
Speaker 1: That's theirs.

598
00:40:37,458 --> 00:40:45,510
Speaker 1: because if you were actually good that Usually you're not as hurt and that gives you the chance to if you had a combo set up to get to it.

599
00:40:45,811 --> 00:40:48,801
Speaker 0: Sometimes there is a small there was a small chance.

600
00:40:48,942 --> 00:40:51,250
Speaker 0: You know and people did escape from that horrible situation.

601
00:40:52,151 --> 00:40:57,970
Speaker 0: However it mostly depended on what balls they were given which is random and not a matter of skill.

602
00:40:59,015 --> 00:41:02,150
Speaker 1: The situation that most lasts a few seconds is not a big deal in this game.

603
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:02,490
Speaker 1: Yeah

604
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:18,908
Speaker 0: the other thing that bothered me is like you know I would set up a big combo and I would just need one particular colored Ball to set it off, and I wouldn't get that colored ball for like you know too many pieces in which case It didn't matter anymore need a completely different color And I never get exactly what I need.

605
00:41:18,928 --> 00:41:27,219
Speaker 0: and It's just kind of annoying because you know all the timing in the world and all the nice setup in the world won't help You if the game doesn't give you the color that you want.

606
00:41:27,741 --> 00:41:32,238
Speaker 1: it also has the interesting mechanic that the game is pretty much Symmetrical both people get the same pieces.

607
00:41:32,299 --> 00:41:39,490
Speaker 1: imagine playing Tetris where everyone gets a square Then everyone gets a line then everyone gets another square.

608
00:41:40,350 --> 00:41:42,772
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of tricky though I mean it doesn't.

609
00:41:42,792 --> 00:41:52,790
Speaker 0: you know as people really start playing you know one guy either drops away more pieces than the other guy and Then one guy gets attacked And it doesn't really you know matter so much anymore.

610
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:56,749
Speaker 0: And you know who knows where in the sequence of balls each guy is.

611
00:41:56,769 --> 00:42:01,229
Speaker 1: well Yeah, but you get the same starting sequence, so you start on a perfectly level playing field.

612
00:42:02,394 --> 00:42:04,710
Speaker 0: Well, you know it's it seems perfectly level.

613
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:08,470
Speaker 0: But then you know a couple eyeballs will fall down and that mixes up the whole thing.

614
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:09,535
Speaker 1: But that's after the start.

615
00:42:09,575 --> 00:42:11,985
Speaker 1: I said you start with a perfectly even playing field.

616
00:42:12,126 --> 00:42:12,809
Speaker 0: yeah, I guess.

617
00:42:12,829 --> 00:42:14,457
Speaker 0: so It just doesn't really.

618
00:42:14,517 --> 00:42:15,683
Speaker 0: it's not really equal.

619
00:42:15,703 --> 00:42:20,870
Speaker 1: It is kind You're just gonna blame because you suck at the game, and I also suck at the game.

620
00:42:20,930 --> 00:42:22,658
Speaker 1: But I accept that fact and move on.

621
00:42:22,759 --> 00:42:25,050
Speaker 0: yeah, well I accept the fact that I suck at the game.

622
00:42:25,432 --> 00:42:26,316
Speaker 0: I'm just pointing out.

623
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,890
Speaker 0: You know these slight imperfections in its puzzling.

624
00:42:29,511 --> 00:42:32,369
Speaker 1: Yeah, I mean there are a lot more games like this like put your pop and whatever.

625
00:42:33,171 --> 00:42:33,974
Speaker 0: Yeah, put your pop.

626
00:42:33,994 --> 00:42:37,129
Speaker 0: That's the one where you just drop the little eyeball guys and match the colors.

627
00:42:37,149 --> 00:42:37,872
Speaker 1: now You shoot them up.

628
00:42:39,336 --> 00:42:40,940
Speaker 0: I think I don't remember.

629
00:42:41,201 --> 00:42:42,585
Speaker 1: There's a million of these games.

630
00:42:42,926 --> 00:42:50,848
Speaker 0: Yeah one other one I just want to talk about real quick is panel day pawn Which you might not know as Pokemon Puzzle League for the n64.

631
00:42:51,912 --> 00:42:55,829
Speaker 0: They changed it to Pokemon when they brought it over here because they figured otherwise no one would want it.

632
00:42:56,834 --> 00:42:59,409
Speaker 0: But it's actually this really kind of good puzzle game.

633
00:42:59,449 --> 00:42:59,630
Speaker 0: where?

634
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:06,130
Speaker 0: You you know there's a bunch of squares of different colors And you kind of flip them and you try to match them up.

635
00:43:06,290 --> 00:43:08,420
Speaker 0: You know to be the same color like you know.

636
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:10,590
Speaker 0: oh, there's a red and a blue next to each other.

637
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:13,018
Speaker 0: Let me you know make them switch places now.

638
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:16,849
Speaker 0: There's three Reds in a row, and they disappear and it came out.

639
00:43:17,753 --> 00:43:19,219
Speaker 0: Oh, no, or did it not come out.

640
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,063
Speaker 0: I can't remember they.

641
00:43:20,645 --> 00:43:23,035
Speaker 1: oh if I had a thought bird It would play right now.

642
00:43:23,135 --> 00:43:26,509
Speaker 0: They made a GBA compilation of puzzle games, and they put dr.

643
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:30,664
Speaker 0: Mario, and it was either panel day pawn or something else on there.

644
00:43:30,965 --> 00:43:34,945
Speaker 0: It was original Yoshi's cookie And I know she's cookie is a bad game.

645
00:43:34,985 --> 00:43:35,830
Speaker 0: I like Yoshi's cookie.

646
00:43:36,151 --> 00:43:41,429
Speaker 0: I think they took out panel day pawn which they were gonna put on there originally which kind of sucks because I like it.

647
00:43:42,455 --> 00:43:44,130
Speaker 0: But yeah, that's it's another similar game.

648
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:48,670
Speaker 0: You know you choose a character and that changes the kind of stuff that happens to the other guy.

649
00:43:49,531 --> 00:43:54,570
Speaker 1: Yeah, if you see these games around they're the best places to find them are usually at anime conventions.

650
00:43:55,711 --> 00:43:59,103
Speaker 0: Another good place is just anywhere you can get PlayStation roms.

651
00:43:59,123 --> 00:44:01,230
Speaker 0: I mean we're talking about PlayStation roms anyway.

652
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:05,050
Speaker 0: They're all Japanese games, but the menus are pretty simple.

653
00:44:05,170 --> 00:44:07,159
Speaker 0: I mean you go to one player.

654
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:09,610
Speaker 1: not only do you not need to know Japanese to play the game?

655
00:44:09,710 --> 00:44:16,330
Speaker 1: But even if you have trouble there are a million facts and walkthroughs and translations because these games are very popular in the u.s.

656
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:19,070
Speaker 1: Among anime fans and hardcore gamers.

657
00:44:19,351 --> 00:44:27,030
Speaker 0: I think most of it has to do with the fact that a lot of them like I said card captor Sakura Tetris and Game like magical drop has an anime intro to it.

658
00:44:27,090 --> 00:44:33,970
Speaker 0: You know they're all anime characters or anime style characters that you're choosing from and that really appeals to anime fans.

659
00:44:35,271 --> 00:44:41,568
Speaker 0: Something else you just want to warn anyone about who tries to play a Japanese PlayStation game because most of these are PlayStation games.

660
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:43,352
Speaker 0: is That in America?

661
00:44:43,673 --> 00:44:53,010
Speaker 1: X is yes, and you know square or triangle is which I never got because I played Japanese games from PlayStation Long before I ever played an actual English game.

662
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:54,896
Speaker 1: It makes sense.

663
00:44:55,157 --> 00:44:56,501
Speaker 1: circle yes X no.

664
00:44:56,621 --> 00:44:57,424
Speaker 1: why did they change it?

665
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:58,728
Speaker 0: in America, I don't know.

666
00:44:58,969 --> 00:45:04,473
Speaker 0: but In Japan and all these Japanese games circle is yes And X is no.

667
00:45:04,554 --> 00:45:08,567
Speaker 0: so when you want to go through the menu to the game you have to push circle.

668
00:45:08,647 --> 00:45:11,740
Speaker 0: if you push X You're gonna go back out into the menu again.

669
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:12,504
Speaker 0: You don't want to do that.

670
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:23,598
Speaker 0: I Just you know it gets a lot of people the first time they sit down to play one of these things And you're trying to progress through the menu and you get to the character select screen And they push X and you're like what did you do now?

671
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:27,730
Speaker 0: We're gonna go back push circle, and then they push X again.

672
00:45:30,633 --> 00:45:31,301
Speaker 0: It's like goddamn.

673
00:45:31,341 --> 00:45:31,928
Speaker 0: it don't push X.

674
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:35,899
Speaker 1: Yeah, so you just gotta have scrotch there to tell you what to do.

675
00:45:36,581 --> 00:45:39,390
Speaker 1: I guess I guess we're thinking scrotch should become the mascot.

676
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,889
Speaker 1: We're gonna try to get a picture of him off of the PlayStation game to put up for everyone to see.

677
00:45:44,453 --> 00:45:45,318
Speaker 0: That's a good idea.

678
00:45:45,338 --> 00:45:47,190
Speaker 0: I think it's absolutely necessary.

679
00:45:47,552 --> 00:45:53,064
Speaker 1: Yeah, I haven't searched to see if anyone else has done it And I'm sure Adam is working on a better version of scrotch,

680
00:45:53,506 --> 00:45:57,532
Speaker 0: and you know if You want to make scrotch do his thing make sure you push circle,

681
00:46:04,778 --> 00:46:07,420
Speaker 1: and that was geek nights with rim and Scott special.
