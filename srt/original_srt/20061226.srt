1
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:10,998
Speaker 0: It's Tuesday December 26th.

2
00:00:11,158 --> 00:00:14,530
Speaker 0: I'm Scott, and I'm rim and this is geek nuts.

3
00:00:15,377 --> 00:00:18,109
Speaker 0: Tonight we talk about Mario party.

4
00:00:20,031 --> 00:00:21,045
Speaker 1: Let's do this.

5
00:00:22,473 --> 00:00:26,899
Speaker 0: it's 10 o'clock on with Tuesday and Rim says all right.

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,207
Speaker 0: Let's do high energy.

7
00:00:28,308 --> 00:00:34,360
Speaker 1: all right I'm like yeah, fuck you see the thing is I can do high energy no matter how fucking tired I am and I'm really fucking tired right now.

8
00:00:34,421 --> 00:00:35,909
Speaker 0: You can't fucking yeah, okay?

9
00:00:37,315 --> 00:00:38,690
Speaker 0: I did it do 10 high energies.

10
00:00:39,272 --> 00:00:45,730
Speaker 1: I think I pulled off quite a bit of high energy despite the late night drunken tired stupor that I was in at Otacon.

11
00:00:46,654 --> 00:00:48,210
Speaker 0: Oh, I guess yeah, but Otacon is different.

12
00:00:48,371 --> 00:00:49,096
Speaker 0: It's like by the.

13
00:00:49,196 --> 00:00:50,847
Speaker 0: in Otacon you have a second wind.

14
00:00:50,968 --> 00:00:55,468
Speaker 1: you know When you're doing something yeah, and I'd already had my first second and fifth wins by that point.

15
00:00:55,689 --> 00:00:59,378
Speaker 0: yeah But when we're at home We don't even use one win.

16
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:01,087
Speaker 0: We don't even know we're near 10 wins.

17
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:03,977
Speaker 1: well We would have but instead we bought some.

18
00:01:04,177 --> 00:01:14,676
Speaker 1: well when we bought all the stuff for the annual front-row crew New Year's bash Extravaganza which for various reasons we have ended up in charge of for the last many years That's fine.

19
00:01:15,078 --> 00:01:16,687
Speaker 0: Just have everyone else do everything else.

20
00:01:16,969 --> 00:01:20,689
Speaker 1: and well We let someone else do it once when way back when we were at our IT.

21
00:01:20,991 --> 00:01:22,037
Speaker 0: That was before we did it.

22
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:24,390
Speaker 0: it was they did it was their thing and they screwed it up.

23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,093
Speaker 0: So then we took it.

24
00:01:25,234 --> 00:01:26,620
Speaker 1: yeah well before that we always like.

25
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,910
Speaker 1: New Year's was always like okay, and father wasn't anything great.

26
00:01:29,371 --> 00:01:33,524
Speaker 1: And then that New Year's was the lamest New Year's party ever like.

27
00:01:33,664 --> 00:01:39,549
Speaker 1: so lame that it forced us To take upon the mantle of requiring everyone to do something awesome every year.

28
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:48,188
Speaker 1: I mean not only was that New Year's so lame But we're probably gonna do a show about New Year's is on Thursday now, so I can tell the story all right all right.

29
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,995
Speaker 0: anyway Let's go with the planned Open e bit.

30
00:01:51,297 --> 00:01:52,845
Speaker 1: oh the plate, but you can't let on that.

31
00:01:52,966 --> 00:01:57,255
Speaker 1: we plan the opening But it's supposed to be like fast karate where it's kind of this Organic.

32
00:01:57,938 --> 00:01:59,446
Speaker 1: we just were talking about something.

33
00:01:59,486 --> 00:02:01,694
Speaker 1: It's like you're a little boy Is a secret.

34
00:02:01,755 --> 00:02:03,982
Speaker 0: fast karate plans quite a bit.

35
00:02:04,504 --> 00:02:05,607
Speaker 1: Here's a secret there.

36
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:06,390
Speaker 1: We plan everything.

37
00:02:07,391 --> 00:02:11,865
Speaker 0: Okay, so when I was a kid you might not know this game echo the dolphin.

38
00:02:12,366 --> 00:02:13,510
Speaker 0: It's the Sega Genesis game.

39
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:16,925
Speaker 1: It was an extremely hyped game that lived up to a lot of the hype.

40
00:02:17,668 --> 00:02:17,990
Speaker 0: I don't know.

41
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:20,038
Speaker 0: I don't remember there being too much hype about it there.

42
00:02:20,118 --> 00:02:21,926
Speaker 1: I saw ads about it every goddamn day.

43
00:02:22,207 --> 00:02:26,655
Speaker 0: all right whatever I only I never bought the game But I played it at the dentist's office.

44
00:02:27,337 --> 00:02:40,653
Speaker 0: and when I played it at the dentist's office on his you know multi cartridge Sega Genesis No I could never get like echo starts in this first little pond and all you can really do is talk to these other dolphins and Swim around.

45
00:02:41,254 --> 00:02:46,129
Speaker 0: and I was never able to escape this beginning pond like I was always stuck in it.

46
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:52,432
Speaker 1: now I'll note that if you haven't played this game It's not like Mario won, but like say I can't get past the first level those goombas Just get me.

47
00:02:53,094 --> 00:02:58,850
Speaker 1: this is like if you can't get past not even the first Goomba, but if you can't start walking, right?

48
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:01,570
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's like you're in a pond, and there's no way out.

49
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:07,930
Speaker 0: There's obviously this path to the right, but it's got these two bricks in the way And it's like well is these two bricks in the way?

50
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:09,069
Speaker 0: How am I supposed to get out of here?

51
00:03:09,691 --> 00:03:17,766
Speaker 0: And I was never as a kid playing it in the dentist's office waiting to go get my teeth cleaned Ever able to figure out what the hell to do to escape this pond.

52
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:18,750
Speaker 0: well today.

53
00:03:19,312 --> 00:03:24,410
Speaker 0: You know we want don't ask why but we bought Mario one for five bucks in the virtual console.

54
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:26,217
Speaker 1: We could answer why but not today.

55
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:29,550
Speaker 0: and while we were doing that I bought freaking echo the dolphin.

56
00:03:29,711 --> 00:03:31,660
Speaker 0: Why not piss away more money on games?

57
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,725
Speaker 0: I could emulate for free.

58
00:03:32,765 --> 00:03:32,986
Speaker 0: what?

59
00:03:33,107 --> 00:03:33,509
Speaker 0: whatever?

60
00:03:34,419 --> 00:03:36,412
Speaker 0: No, it's stupid Cares.

61
00:03:36,552 --> 00:03:41,710
Speaker 1: see that's how Nintendo wins because the normal people buy stuff on the virtual console anyway because they don't know better.

62
00:03:42,172 --> 00:03:46,370
Speaker 1: We know better, and it's painful when we do it, but we do it anyway.

63
00:03:46,612 --> 00:03:49,510
Speaker 0: We're just masochists over here video game masochists.

64
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:54,427
Speaker 0: But I bought echo the dolphin and I played it and I escaped the first pond.

65
00:03:54,487 --> 00:03:55,210
Speaker 0: it was amazing.

66
00:03:55,230 --> 00:03:56,214
Speaker 0: I was like oh shit.

67
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:57,640
Speaker 0: I escaped the first part.

68
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,022
Speaker 0: He did.

69
00:03:58,082 --> 00:03:58,965
Speaker 0: it took me 24 years.

70
00:04:00,151 --> 00:04:00,474
Speaker 0: He did.

71
00:04:00,575 --> 00:04:01,120
Speaker 0: it is easy.

72
00:04:01,201 --> 00:04:03,055
Speaker 1: at first bond I mean, it's not like.

73
00:04:03,135 --> 00:04:05,990
Speaker 0: I guess I'll take me 24 years cuz I'm older than echo the dolphin.

74
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,156
Speaker 0: But you get the point seriously.

75
00:04:07,196 --> 00:04:09,950
Speaker 1: you've sat down and with no effort escape the first part.

76
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:10,493
Speaker 1: It was like.

77
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:13,490
Speaker 0: and then I proceeded to the right and started to explore.

78
00:04:14,695 --> 00:04:21,387
Speaker 0: All of a sudden I'm exploring all over the place You know and I'm finding all this good stuff and eventually I find this big blue gem.

79
00:04:21,447 --> 00:04:23,638
Speaker 0: It's huge It's bigger than me, and I'm like oh shit.

80
00:04:23,658 --> 00:04:28,321
Speaker 0: That's got to be something good, so I start poking it you know trying to figure out what the hell to do to make it.

81
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:29,829
Speaker 0: you know do its Jimmy thing.

82
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:33,888
Speaker 0: and I got stuck under the gem and I couldn't move.

83
00:04:33,908 --> 00:04:37,246
Speaker 0: I Was stuck under the gem and I couldn't move.

84
00:04:37,729 --> 00:04:47,914
Speaker 1: now I'm sitting there and Scott's dolphin is is upright like Sitting there with his nose stuck in the ground and he keeps hitting buttons and screaming and for a minute I wasn't screaming.

85
00:04:47,994 --> 00:04:49,058
Speaker 1: No the dolphin was screaming.

86
00:04:49,118 --> 00:04:49,721
Speaker 0: Oh the dolphin.

87
00:04:49,741 --> 00:04:56,180
Speaker 0: We have every time I push the squeak button the dolphin goes Kind of like a thought bird or like a dolphin.

88
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,170
Speaker 1: yeah like a dolphin bird right thought.

89
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:00,954
Speaker 1: So I'm watching him.

90
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:03,342
Speaker 0: I'm thinking is there evolutionarily related.

91
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,410
Speaker 1: I'm thinking why doesn't Scott move?

92
00:05:06,016 --> 00:05:07,189
Speaker 1: Why is he just sitting there?

93
00:05:07,571 --> 00:05:16,197
Speaker 1: I could it's obvious what you have to do move and then before I can say anything and he's or he could say anything I think oh Did the game glitch?

94
00:05:16,237 --> 00:05:16,840
Speaker 1: is he stuck?

95
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,649
Speaker 1: and then Scott says I think I'm stuck I?

96
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,848
Speaker 0: Was the dolphin was most definitely stuck at the bottom of the ocean?

97
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:26,316
Speaker 0: Tomorrow for the second time.

98
00:05:26,377 --> 00:05:27,260
Speaker 0: well, I guess maybe not.

99
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,066
Speaker 1: no you've got to wait 10 years.

100
00:05:29,167 --> 00:05:29,910
Speaker 1: come back to it.

101
00:05:30,030 --> 00:05:30,613
Speaker 0: I know whatever.

102
00:05:30,653 --> 00:05:38,750
Speaker 0: the next time I decide to play my $8 echo the dolphin I will have to and I escaped that first pond for the second time of my life.

103
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,524
Speaker 0: I'll have to avoid getting stuck somehow.

104
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:45,039
Speaker 0: I don't know how But I'll try right.

105
00:05:45,119 --> 00:05:46,584
Speaker 1: so instead of a news today.

106
00:05:46,604 --> 00:05:54,463
Speaker 1: I'm gonna do something kind of crazy something We haven't done in a long time Something for which we don't even have music because we do it so infrequently.

107
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:56,048
Speaker 1: I got a geek back.

108
00:05:56,309 --> 00:06:03,339
Speaker 0: Oh shit That's no good no all right.

109
00:06:03,379 --> 00:06:06,474
Speaker 1: This is from Maximilian and a couple weeks ago We were talking about Germany.

110
00:06:06,514 --> 00:06:08,340
Speaker 0: and when did he send us this email?

111
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,908
Speaker 0: Oh god December 16, okay?

112
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:11,630
Speaker 0: What's what's today?

113
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:12,870
Speaker 1: December?

114
00:06:13,571 --> 00:06:15,462
Speaker 1: Something far later days ago.

115
00:06:15,563 --> 00:06:16,710
Speaker 1: not that bad all right.

116
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:29,668
Speaker 1: But he said the feedback pretty much right after the episode where we talked about the crazy the batshit crazy Legislation that some people in Germany are trying to put forward to criminalize violent video games.

117
00:06:29,949 --> 00:06:33,459
Speaker 0: all right They want to just like put FPS designers in jail or whatever.

118
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,244
Speaker 1: something crazy and crazy.

119
00:06:35,545 --> 00:06:39,283
Speaker 1: well knowing a bit about Germany I mean being in Germany at least.

120
00:06:39,364 --> 00:06:42,790
Speaker 1: I assume he's in Germany And I assume he's probably one of our listeners.

121
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:47,064
Speaker 1: I just don't know his screen name because I'm lazy, and I don't pay attention anymore.

122
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:48,710
Speaker 0: obviously he listens to the show.

123
00:06:49,101 --> 00:06:50,716
Speaker 0: Yeah I think that's got to be.

124
00:06:50,977 --> 00:06:53,447
Speaker 0: if you didn't listen to the show we better call Randy cuz.

125
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:54,150
Speaker 0: he's gonna win a prize.

126
00:06:54,150 --> 00:07:00,710
Speaker 1: The thing is we have a not an insignificant number of German listeners and more than one of them is in the forums.

127
00:07:01,173 --> 00:07:10,719
Speaker 1: So I so if I see another person who talks about Germany I'm not sure which person it is or if it's a new person entirely Whatever but anyway He has some really good insight into this whole thing.

128
00:07:10,739 --> 00:07:13,428
Speaker 1: cuz we're not really experts on Germany in any.

129
00:07:14,171 --> 00:07:19,510
Speaker 1: I mean I I know a lot about Germany back when Rome was around, but not so much about modern German.

130
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:27,049
Speaker 0: I know about as much about Germany as I know about most major countries that aren't my own country and not Japan.

131
00:07:28,972 --> 00:07:30,599
Speaker 0: And I guess I know more about Israel.

132
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,046
Speaker 0: I didn't about Germany, but that's about it.

133
00:07:32,146 --> 00:07:32,910
Speaker 1: Yeah, so I'll read this.

134
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:34,102
Speaker 1: I may or may not paraphrase.

135
00:07:34,122 --> 00:07:34,830
Speaker 1: We'll see how it goes.

136
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:41,052
Speaker 1: It's kind of long, but I think it stands on its own and it'll add some I guess clarification to what we had said about Germany.

137
00:07:41,754 --> 00:07:45,690
Speaker 1: hi Raymond Scott, I thought I should write something about the whole thing with the game ratings in Germany.

138
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,345
Speaker 1: I just wrote all this for a different site and thought you might want to read it.

139
00:07:49,988 --> 00:07:52,135
Speaker 1: first of all We're not Nazis winky face.

140
00:07:52,617 --> 00:07:56,489
Speaker 1: second this whole discussion started in like 2003 so it's actually old news.

141
00:07:57,231 --> 00:08:03,830
Speaker 1: Germany is split into 16 states only two of which want to have this law that you're not allowed to play or develop violent games.

142
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,957
Speaker 0: Stop right there.

143
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,969
Speaker 0: Why don't those two states?

144
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:10,789
Speaker 0: Just become like Utah and the rest of Germany can be all cool.

145
00:08:11,131 --> 00:08:16,050
Speaker 1: You know Utah is kind of shitty, and I wish it wasn't that way, so I don't know.

146
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:26,868
Speaker 1: I don't know how Germany works But I'm glad that Utah is Utah and Utah doesn't spread its snow because if Utah spread out There'd be like one of them well Maybe like 20 of them in every state, and then they wouldn't get anything they wanted.

147
00:08:28,171 --> 00:08:30,750
Speaker 0: I'm glad Utah only affects, Utah.

148
00:08:30,991 --> 00:08:38,770
Speaker 0: It doesn't affect anyone else, but if they were spread out not only were there not be Yeah, I'm not I mean spread out as if their power was more.

149
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,948
Speaker 1: I agree with you, but if we spread them out their power would be.

150
00:08:40,989 --> 00:08:43,600
Speaker 0: yet We have to contain them to where they can't affect other people.

151
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,388
Speaker 1: We've got to garymander them.

152
00:08:45,488 --> 00:08:49,345
Speaker 1: yes right anyway Germany blah blah blah.

153
00:08:50,135 --> 00:08:59,050
Speaker 1: This will never go through Never I'm not sure because I think that they are all the same political party And I guess that the other parties will just say no to get them pissed off.

154
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,856
Speaker 1: So you know German political stuff.

155
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:04,730
Speaker 1: that and the board game die bacher is all I know about German government.

156
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:07,276
Speaker 1: Yeah, the rating system is pretty harsh.

157
00:09:07,376 --> 00:09:13,352
Speaker 1: red steel is an 18-plus call of duty 18-plus Star Wars Battlefront 16-plus Etc.

158
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:18,850
Speaker 1: you see German politicians aren't scared of us being nazis again since Germany is overprotective.

159
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:20,255
Speaker 1: This may make a little more sense.

160
00:09:20,676 --> 00:09:23,405
Speaker 1: some guy shoots 20 people in a school in 2003.

161
00:09:23,405 --> 00:09:26,443
Speaker 1: German politicians say to themselves What was so special about him?

162
00:09:26,504 --> 00:09:26,847
Speaker 1: Let's see?

163
00:09:28,011 --> 00:09:28,693
Speaker 1: Here's music.

164
00:09:29,014 --> 00:09:30,659
Speaker 1: know that he reads books know that.

165
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:33,066
Speaker 1: oh, what's this doom to encounter?

166
00:09:33,106 --> 00:09:34,310
Speaker 1: strike first?

167
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:39,810
Speaker 1: Everyone says it was because of the games, but then they find out that he didn't pass the final school exam for the second time.

168
00:09:39,971 --> 00:09:42,668
Speaker 1: I guess that's what caused it, and they forgot all about that.

169
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:46,786
Speaker 1: Now I think one month ago this guy goes to school hurts 14 people.

170
00:09:47,007 --> 00:09:51,383
Speaker 1: no one even died And they killed himself and everyone says all caps computer games.

171
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:52,146
Speaker 1: No nose.

172
00:09:52,808 --> 00:09:55,903
Speaker 1: I'll bet now Knows anything about that anymore.

173
00:09:55,944 --> 00:09:57,386
Speaker 1: it got brought up in the news like twice.

174
00:09:57,847 --> 00:10:00,796
Speaker 1: most Germans understand that the main problem You know isn't video games.

175
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:01,358
Speaker 1: It's quote.

176
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,389
Speaker 1: Where do you get that rifle unquote?

177
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,149
Speaker 0: Yeah, isn't it a lot harder to get guns in Germany than it is here?

178
00:10:07,431 --> 00:10:10,829
Speaker 0: Yeah, I guess I have a lot stricter gun control than we do I believe.

179
00:10:10,869 --> 00:10:12,550
Speaker 0: so I don't think they have a Second Amendment.

180
00:10:12,972 --> 00:10:14,923
Speaker 1: So I guess it's a lot like America.

181
00:10:15,023 --> 00:10:22,490
Speaker 1: Germany has its Jack Thompson's who make a big ruckus or like the people in America are like yeah Bring back the draft, and then the news reports.

182
00:10:22,854 --> 00:10:24,310
Speaker 1: They're trying to bring back the draft.

183
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:30,398
Speaker 1: But the actual reality is one guy is trying to bring back the draft And he wasn't even trying to bring it back.

184
00:10:30,418 --> 00:10:32,144
Speaker 0: well like seriously.

185
00:10:32,204 --> 00:10:33,890
Speaker 0: He was trying to bring it back to make a point.

186
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:39,590
Speaker 1: Yeah, ironically, so I guess in this case Germany's not as crazy as the world thought they were.

187
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:48,327
Speaker 1: It's just that because this thing was so crazy like they all the gamers who read this probably thought of Germany What the rest of the world thinks about the u.s.. When they read about Jack Thompson.

188
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:48,850
Speaker 1: yeah?

189
00:10:49,334 --> 00:10:50,907
Speaker 0: I think it's a little worse than Jack Thompson.

190
00:10:50,927 --> 00:10:56,984
Speaker 0: Yeah Yeah, you know what it tells me Jack Thompson He should move to Germany cuz they'll find some friends there cuz he ain't finding any here.

191
00:10:57,185 --> 00:11:07,414
Speaker 0: well in at least two states It was a funny thing with Jack Thompson on like in 60 minutes or some show I don't even know and they were just totally the guy who is totally Laugh.

192
00:11:07,454 --> 00:11:07,918
Speaker 0: it had him.

193
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,823
Speaker 1: It's not hard to laugh at Jack But I can't talk about Jack Thompson cuz he hasn't done anything newsworthy in a while.

194
00:11:14,205 --> 00:11:15,930
Speaker 0: He's just been his usual crazy self.

195
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:17,456
Speaker 1: Yes, I mean at this point.

196
00:11:17,496 --> 00:11:20,950
Speaker 1: He would have to like murder a baby in order for me to talk about him again.

197
00:11:21,432 --> 00:11:22,295
Speaker 0: I don't think that's gonna happen.

198
00:11:22,717 --> 00:11:25,268
Speaker 0: We'll see all right, so I got some news here.

199
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:38,773
Speaker 0: quite often I do stories about video game advertising because it's becoming more and more of a Problem, I guess yeah, I don't play PC games anymore not through lack of desire Just through lack of new game.

200
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:40,759
Speaker 0: No this advertising and on PC games.

201
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,682
Speaker 0: so at some point.

202
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:42,846
Speaker 1: well monkey ball.

203
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:48,107
Speaker 0: Yeah, right No are the dole ads still in monkey ball, I didn't see them in the one we have.

204
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,453
Speaker 1: uh I didn't look.

205
00:11:49,494 --> 00:11:51,161
Speaker 1: there weren't so many bananas in the minigames.

206
00:11:51,221 --> 00:11:51,824
Speaker 1: I didn't notice.

207
00:11:51,965 --> 00:11:55,397
Speaker 0: yeah anyway someone did a study.

208
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:56,565
Speaker 0: who did the study?

209
00:11:56,665 --> 00:11:57,188
Speaker 0: bunnyfoot.

210
00:11:57,209 --> 00:12:01,300
Speaker 0: a Behavioral research agency called bunnyfoot did a study.

211
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,290
Speaker 1: That's a pretty awesome name for a behavioral research institute.

212
00:12:04,612 --> 00:12:10,929
Speaker 0: yeah, I wonder if it's this is BS or not, but Maybe I should just not do this story.

213
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:16,390
Speaker 0: I'll do it anyway, but basically they did a study with some video games.

214
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:22,414
Speaker 0: They had a hundred and twenty people playing who were age 18 or older And they played them.

215
00:12:22,615 --> 00:12:28,109
Speaker 0: they've had them play sports games such as Gran Turismo 3 NBA live and Project Gotham racing.

216
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:28,832
Speaker 1: wait Wait wait wait.

217
00:12:28,992 --> 00:12:33,184
Speaker 1: sports games such as Gran Turismo 3 that's not much of a sport as driving in circles.

218
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:42,213
Speaker 1: Yeah, yeah, whatever I was hoping for a NASCAR argument or something never mind I get.

219
00:12:42,233 --> 00:12:45,221
Speaker 0: NASCAR is a sport in you know.

220
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:50,476
Speaker 0: I mean it is it's not the greatest but it's a sport.

221
00:12:50,596 --> 00:13:01,950
Speaker 0: anyway, they had people play these video games and According to them recall recall and recognition of in-game ads was low across the board.

222
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:11,570
Speaker 0: NBA live and some wrestling game came out on top and Project Gotham Racing 3 had no consumer engagement at all.

223
00:13:11,951 --> 00:13:19,188
Speaker 0: Wow, so I think that's obvious is that in a racing game where the ads are flying by you You're really not going to notice them at all.

224
00:13:19,651 --> 00:13:27,362
Speaker 0: but in a game like what are the other ones are pro wrestling which isn't a sport and Basketball you're pretty much looking at the same thing the whole time.

225
00:13:27,603 --> 00:13:29,430
Speaker 0: so the ad is just constantly there.

226
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:34,330
Speaker 0: That's definitely gonna have more of an effect, but it was still low across the board.

227
00:13:34,470 --> 00:13:37,159
Speaker 0: No one pays attention to in-game ads even when they're there.

228
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:38,022
Speaker 1: see here's my worry.

229
00:13:38,404 --> 00:13:40,250
Speaker 1: most people don't pay attention to TV ads either.

230
00:13:40,654 --> 00:13:53,869
Speaker 1: most I mean other than Internet ads where you could actually like how many people click on them and all that as dubious as those metrics may be I have a feeling that Advertised depend I mean in the chain the people who do the studies or?

231
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:56,536
Speaker 1: Understand how ineffective ads are?

232
00:13:56,997 --> 00:13:58,662
Speaker 1: are not the people buying the ads?

233
00:13:58,743 --> 00:14:03,289
Speaker 1: and I don't think that studies like this no matter how many you're Done would have any effect on the number of ads in video games.

234
00:14:03,932 --> 00:14:05,378
Speaker 0: No, I don't think so either.

235
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:19,348
Speaker 0: Here's the problem right is you have The advertising industry itself which while they do things We don't like they're good people working in that industry, and if we stop buying ads people are out of jobs.

236
00:14:19,448 --> 00:14:24,059
Speaker 0: Oh well - you've got a lot of things that we do like.

237
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:27,410
Speaker 0: that can only exist because of advertising.

238
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,670
Speaker 0: Without advertising they wouldn't exist because they have no way to make money.

239
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:35,897
Speaker 0: They would either have to just do it for free or not do it And there's really no way for them to make money.

240
00:14:35,918 --> 00:14:37,923
Speaker 0: at least no currently existing business model.

241
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:39,307
Speaker 1: Ha like slashdot.

242
00:14:39,488 --> 00:14:46,029
Speaker 0: Yeah exactly Three if People don't pay attention to ads and they don't like ads.

243
00:14:46,812 --> 00:14:49,700
Speaker 0: But people seem to some people seem to think ads work.

244
00:14:50,261 --> 00:14:53,613
Speaker 0: if someone ever puts two and two together this whole shit house is gonna go.

245
00:14:53,836 --> 00:14:59,665
Speaker 1: I Mean the nerds all figured it out, and we just use adblock.

246
00:14:59,826 --> 00:15:00,469
Speaker 0: yeah, I know.

247
00:15:00,529 --> 00:15:03,054
Speaker 0: but Someday some advertise.

248
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:10,880
Speaker 0: some people who buy ads from ad agencies are gonna start to realize hey our ads don't do shit Let's stop buying them.

249
00:15:11,121 --> 00:15:12,629
Speaker 0: then the ad agency is gonna go.

250
00:15:12,669 --> 00:15:15,038
Speaker 0: shit We're out of customers is gonna be no ads.

251
00:15:15,299 --> 00:15:21,849
Speaker 0: then the people who do things supported by selling advertising space They're gonna be in the shit like a network TV.

252
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:25,541
Speaker 0: Oh, yeah, all all at once are gonna have no network television.

253
00:15:26,003 --> 00:15:27,848
Speaker 0: all the advertisers are gonna be out of jobs.

254
00:15:27,868 --> 00:15:32,004
Speaker 0: well look now Who make products and services are gonna save a lot of and network TV.

255
00:15:32,024 --> 00:15:48,804
Speaker 1: as soon as things like TiVo appeared suddenly people started skipping ads and the executives in the TV industry got really nervous real quick and doing everything they can to make sure that time-shifting is either illegal or Limited or coming up with any way to force you to watch those ads.

256
00:15:48,945 --> 00:15:53,050
Speaker 0: I mean I go to the movie theater And they've got the freaking ads lined up at the front.

257
00:15:53,190 --> 00:16:03,910
Speaker 1: You know what bothers me more than that when I go to the movie theater and the ads are playing And I continue to talk because the ads are playing and not the actual movie, and I get shushed by someone around me.

258
00:16:04,672 --> 00:16:06,777
Speaker 0: Yeah, what I've never been sure.

259
00:16:06,877 --> 00:16:07,639
Speaker 1: I've been sure.

260
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:13,299
Speaker 1: I've been shushed by making noise during the coca-cola ad that comes before every So much shush me during the ads.

261
00:16:13,359 --> 00:16:15,290
Speaker 0: I would start yelling it like it's a freaking ad.

262
00:16:16,351 --> 00:16:17,277
Speaker 0: What's wrong with you?

263
00:16:17,318 --> 00:16:19,190
Speaker 1: my altercation went along those lines?

264
00:16:19,331 --> 00:16:23,070
Speaker 1: And it was responded to with a louder shush and a look of exasperation.

265
00:16:24,071 --> 00:16:27,984
Speaker 0: I Would have done it again to see how far that exasperation would go.

266
00:16:28,004 --> 00:16:29,390
Speaker 1: it was a big fat lady.

267
00:16:29,430 --> 00:16:30,475
Speaker 1: I don't think she was gonna do much.

268
00:16:30,495 --> 00:16:31,219
Speaker 1: You couldn't catch me.

269
00:16:32,063 --> 00:16:35,019
Speaker 0: I get her as indignant as possible So she would get kicked out of the theater.

270
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:35,381
Speaker 1: No.

271
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:36,789
Speaker 1: I didn't really want to bother with that.

272
00:16:37,711 --> 00:16:40,064
Speaker 0: I thought it's all that would be more entertaining than the movie.

273
00:16:40,286 --> 00:16:43,110
Speaker 0: What movie is there That'd be more entertaining than a diggin fat lady?

274
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:43,974
Speaker 1: I don't know.

275
00:16:44,014 --> 00:16:47,310
Speaker 0: I was I'd go to the theater and sit through ads just to see indignant fat lady.

276
00:16:48,313 --> 00:16:49,209
Speaker 1: Let's make a movie.

277
00:16:49,752 --> 00:16:50,654
Speaker 0: Indignant fat lady.

278
00:16:50,735 --> 00:16:51,598
Speaker 1: Why don't we?

279
00:16:51,838 --> 00:16:55,510
Speaker 1: why don't we just make a movie like, you know, Jackass and Borat and all those movies?

280
00:16:55,813 --> 00:17:00,799
Speaker 1: But all we do is go around Find the type of person who is conducive to being made indignant.

281
00:17:01,381 --> 00:17:02,404
Speaker 1: make them indignant.

282
00:17:02,484 --> 00:17:05,893
Speaker 1: the way John Cleese used to irritate people Sounds good.

283
00:17:06,295 --> 00:17:07,579
Speaker 1: and never buying the release.

284
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:08,361
Speaker 1: never do.

285
00:17:08,401 --> 00:17:12,073
Speaker 1: never push them over the edge to where they get so indignant that they turn to Anger and punch.

286
00:17:12,334 --> 00:17:19,880
Speaker 0: All right, everyone start sending us money and we will go buy a camera and make this movie or Film yourselves making people indignant.

287
00:17:20,382 --> 00:17:26,752
Speaker 1: Well, no because that requires many cameras No And it's none of which we own and then just put them on YouTube and then we can watch him or we can skip That whole movie thing.

288
00:17:26,772 --> 00:17:30,750
Speaker 0: Well, no, see I'm hoping to actually like, you know, because I know that's not actually gonna happen.

289
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:31,634
Speaker 0: We're just shit talkers.

290
00:17:31,674 --> 00:17:32,859
Speaker 0: I want to get like a camera here.

291
00:17:33,602 --> 00:17:35,188
Speaker 0: Yeah, that's the only electronic gadget.

292
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,172
Speaker 0: We don't have All right.

293
00:17:36,192 --> 00:17:37,618
Speaker 1: Yeah send us money lots of money.

294
00:17:37,698 --> 00:17:40,850
Speaker 1: send us cameras and go to dig and dig us and then give us money.

295
00:17:41,055 --> 00:17:43,469
Speaker 0: Yeah, right Give us money for nothing.

296
00:17:51,261 --> 00:17:52,452
Speaker 1: things of the day.

297
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:56,420
Speaker 0: Oh Man, I got a nice backlog of things of the day here for you people.

298
00:17:56,902 --> 00:18:00,940
Speaker 1: All right, so pop one out of the queue or push one out of the depending on what you're using.

299
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,663
Speaker 1: Yeah got a stack or a queue.

300
00:18:03,105 --> 00:18:13,040
Speaker 0: this here is a pretty good article that came up today and it was around the Nets and I think I didn't read it at all actually, but I know that it's gonna be interesting.

301
00:18:13,702 --> 00:18:29,356
Speaker 0: The title of the article is the history of computer role-playing games part 1 the early years 1980 Through 1983. it starts out by talking about tabletop games and how they took those systems and ported them into the computer.

302
00:18:29,376 --> 00:18:33,320
Speaker 0: and then You know, it starts off with like mainframe games.

303
00:18:34,407 --> 00:18:44,157
Speaker 0: and let's see 1983. this article ends with games like Dungeons of Dagorath tunnels of doom.

304
00:18:45,342 --> 00:18:46,346
Speaker 1: Wow, you know what?

305
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:47,229
Speaker 1: These games can't?

306
00:18:47,269 --> 00:19:00,980
Speaker 0: I mean much like the Italian guard the Atari Role-playing adventure games that we picked up, you know These actually look more playable than those because you actually have the controls of a computer.

307
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:02,868
Speaker 0: They talk about Ultima 1 in here.

308
00:19:02,969 --> 00:19:05,440
Speaker 1: Yeah, but yeah, Ultima 1 was not a good game.

309
00:19:05,601 --> 00:19:07,106
Speaker 0: No, none of these are really good games.

310
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:07,528
Speaker 0: Actually.

311
00:19:07,709 --> 00:19:08,632
Speaker 0: This one looks pretty good.

312
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:09,636
Speaker 0: temple of aps.

313
00:19:09,676 --> 00:19:12,306
Speaker 0: Hi I mean, I'll even kind of fun.

314
00:19:12,387 --> 00:19:24,149
Speaker 1: even a lot of the later games like the gold box D&D games and all that and Even although a lot of the later Ultima's as much nostalgia and joy as I gained and have from these games They're a bit shit.

315
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:25,720
Speaker 0: All these games are pretty bad.

316
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:34,520
Speaker 0: But back in their day they were it, you know And it was a lot easier than you know to play if you're a loser sitting at home and you had a computer.

317
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:38,755
Speaker 0: There's a lot easier to play these games and to find some friends for some real D&D action.

318
00:19:39,156 --> 00:19:45,399
Speaker 1: Ah true true Yeah, I guess we're lucky that I mean we grew up in the era of online gaming and MMOs.

319
00:19:46,122 --> 00:19:47,916
Speaker 0: Yeah, you know some of these are better than MMOs.

320
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:49,866
Speaker 0: I got to say depends

321
00:19:49,906 --> 00:19:50,569
Speaker 1: on the MMO,

322
00:19:50,890 --> 00:20:04,975
Speaker 0: but either way if you are, you know Someone who is a fan of role-playing games of any sort and especially the video role-playing games, you know Those all came from somewhere, you know, the Japanese didn't invent them, you know, it's like we.

323
00:20:05,055 --> 00:20:06,420
Speaker 0: it's like most things in Japan.

324
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:07,306
Speaker 0: We invented it.

325
00:20:07,366 --> 00:20:09,339
Speaker 0: They took it made it better and sold it back to us.

326
00:20:09,882 --> 00:20:20,866
Speaker 0: Yeah, like that whole samurai thing or that language More like I know the car the anime the manga Yeah, all that.

327
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:21,187
Speaker 0: Yeah.

328
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:21,348
Speaker 1: Yeah.

329
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:21,650
Speaker 1: Yeah.

330
00:20:21,911 --> 00:20:23,739
Speaker 0: Anyway all the stuff that we actually like.

331
00:20:25,429 --> 00:20:43,360
Speaker 0: but Yeah, so the role-playing game is yet another thing like that and here you can read the history because I'm pretty sure that Most of our listeners, you know, I mean we got some old listeners who are playing these games But most of you probably weren't playing Computer RPGs when I was zero years old.

332
00:20:43,802 --> 00:20:47,939
Speaker 0: So this article will enlighten you to many things enlighten me to many things and I'm about to read it.

333
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:50,408
Speaker 0: So have it out loud.

334
00:20:50,609 --> 00:20:51,733
Speaker 1: You're gonna read the whole thing for us.

335
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:54,443
Speaker 0: No, it's fucking long and it's only part one God damn.

336
00:20:54,463 --> 00:20:57,800
Speaker 1: Okay, cuz I'm definitely not reading my thing, which is an entire Wikipedia entry.

337
00:20:58,283 --> 00:21:00,820
Speaker 0: You're gonna see these a Wikipedia entry for your thing of the day.

338
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:08,379
Speaker 1: I am because actually the story was dug up and I was just gonna use that because whatever it was dug up But it got dug up and then it got waned.

339
00:21:09,321 --> 00:21:13,800
Speaker 1: Okay, or dug or whatever you want to call it penny arcade it slash dotted.

340
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:26,112
Speaker 1: But I know that I mean most people in continental Europe and Britain know about this and I know a lot of Americans do But I also know that a lot of Americans don't and that saddens me.

341
00:21:26,413 --> 00:21:49,013
Speaker 1: you see during World War one Which was probably the most pointless of all the wars of the modern era Probably one of the most pointless wars ever with the possible exception of the Crimean War Which as far as I can tell served no purpose other than to add a chapter to my history book And to give me the charge of the light Brigade, but the Christmas truce.

342
00:21:49,675 --> 00:21:51,040
Speaker 1: World War one horrible war.

343
00:21:51,144 --> 00:22:02,076
Speaker 1: basically they were just sending people into no man's land to die against machine guns and the primary battle strategy was to send more guys than the other guy and gas warfare.

344
00:22:02,136 --> 00:22:07,215
Speaker 1: and it was you know, the modern Industrialized way of civil war and just it was.

345
00:22:07,677 --> 00:22:08,440
Speaker 1: it was a horrible thing.

346
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:17,959
Speaker 1: No one argues that it was not a horrible thing But it was also one of the last wars where something like this it could happen let alone did happen.

347
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:38,620
Speaker 1: You see in the December of 1914 along the front between Germany and France the troops basically stopped fighting and in many places celebrated Christmas together and And even in some point snuck to each other's trenches or into no-man's land and had small parties exchanged gifts.

348
00:22:39,383 --> 00:22:42,335
Speaker 0: What about the land mines in the way land mines?

349
00:22:42,355 --> 00:22:43,480
Speaker 1: there weren't so many land mines.

350
00:22:43,661 --> 00:22:47,379
Speaker 1: Okay, no man's land was no man's land mostly because of the machine guns.

351
00:22:47,802 --> 00:22:51,060
Speaker 0: I know mostly because the machine guns, but I figured if you walk there you is no good.

352
00:22:51,401 --> 00:23:02,761
Speaker 1: well base, I mean the thing is these troops there started to be this wave of people who just said we're not gonna fight anymore and It got pretty bad as far as the military commanders were Concerned.

353
00:23:03,443 --> 00:23:07,539
Speaker 1: and actually it didn't really happen in any year or any war since then.

354
00:23:08,121 --> 00:23:14,460
Speaker 1: Because the commanders after seeing what happened did everything in their power to make sure that that sort of thing could never happen again.

355
00:23:15,282 --> 00:23:28,910
Speaker 1: But I guess at least for this one moment in one of the bloodiest wars in the history of the world The people fighting realized that it was all just bullshit and at least until they were forced to start shooting at each other again In a few areas they stopped.

356
00:23:29,332 --> 00:23:33,410
Speaker 1: and if you don't know anything about this I highly suggest you read the Wikipedia article provided.

357
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,699
Speaker 1: It doesn't become vandalized in the next seven seconds.

358
00:23:37,266 --> 00:23:40,679
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's kind of a change though because you think oh that happened to World War one, right?

359
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:43,367
Speaker 1: Well, that was almost a hundred years ago.

360
00:23:43,387 --> 00:23:51,053
Speaker 0: I know I know but in the Revolutionary War, which is a 200 years ago You had George Washington attacking people on Christmas.

361
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:52,740
Speaker 1: Well, yeah, but not only that.

362
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:55,180
Speaker 1: Well, I mean Americans were some of the first terrorists.

363
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:57,722
Speaker 1: But think of this.

364
00:23:57,742 --> 00:24:10,009
Speaker 1: during the American Civil War the battles were so like regular and pitched that many battles had tourists and Civilians having picnics in the nearby fields watching.

365
00:24:10,030 --> 00:24:12,135
Speaker 1: Yeah, think about that.

366
00:24:12,155 --> 00:24:14,884
Speaker 1: That doesn't happen anymore That can't happen.

367
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:19,079
Speaker 0: Well, you know before they had football war was the only thing on the telly.

368
00:24:19,753 --> 00:24:30,047
Speaker 1: I mean I'm not saying that we should go back to the time when war was noble or Noble in the stupid ironic not actually noble sense Yeah, but I don't know it.

369
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,849
Speaker 0: in some ways war would used to be more brutal But in some ways it used to be more civil.

370
00:24:36,130 --> 00:24:38,680
Speaker 0: Yeah gasp only if we could get rid of it entire.

371
00:24:38,841 --> 00:24:43,377
Speaker 1: Oh, no a complex view of history that cannot be expressed in short sound bites.

372
00:24:43,658 --> 00:24:45,966
Speaker 1: Yes Yeah, just read about this.

373
00:24:46,006 --> 00:24:48,694
Speaker 1: This is something interesting that really says a lot about.

374
00:24:48,995 --> 00:24:55,105
Speaker 1: no matter how shitty people are There are still good people even in the worst situations Sometimes.

375
00:24:55,146 --> 00:25:04,198
Speaker 0: yeah, I mean two ugly fat Nazis having a fistfight Fat ladies one of them's talking during the ads and the other one doesn't like it.

376
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:06,730
Speaker 1: Yeah, there's no good there.

377
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:07,173
Speaker 1: Yeah.

378
00:25:07,818 --> 00:25:14,520
Speaker 1: Wow There was more good in no man's land in World War one on December 24th 1914 and there wasn't a movie theater.

379
00:25:14,622 --> 00:25:15,277
Speaker 1: I was at once.

380
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,668
Speaker 0: Yeah We're just gasping all over the place today.

381
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:22,700
Speaker 1: Yeah, we got some gasping stories for another day.

382
00:25:23,781 --> 00:25:24,162
Speaker 0: We do.

383
00:25:24,182 --> 00:25:24,242
Speaker 0: Yes.

384
00:25:24,543 --> 00:25:25,787
Speaker 1: What were you gonna talk about?

385
00:25:26,569 --> 00:25:28,996
Speaker 0: I forget Mario Party Mario Party.

386
00:25:29,056 --> 00:25:30,400
Speaker 1: It's me Mario.

387
00:25:30,626 --> 00:25:35,698
Speaker 0: All right I think we're mostly gonna talk about Mario Party's four and five because those are the ones we have played the most.

388
00:25:35,838 --> 00:25:40,135
Speaker 1: I think we're gonna Talk mostly about the idea of Mario Party and the pros and cons of that.

389
00:25:40,276 --> 00:25:41,761
Speaker 0: I think that's a good way to start Okay.

390
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:43,746
Speaker 0: So what is Mario Party?

391
00:25:43,766 --> 00:25:50,146
Speaker 0: Well, it started a long time ago and In the Nintendo 64 they came out with a game called Mario Party.

392
00:25:50,326 --> 00:25:58,791
Speaker 0: now by the name of it You can guess the point of Mario Party was that you and three of your friends could have a party and Mario would help you Out.

393
00:25:59,333 --> 00:26:01,182
Speaker 1: now in gaming terms.

394
00:26:01,363 --> 00:26:04,804
Speaker 1: It was basically just an American style board game.

395
00:26:04,825 --> 00:26:17,610
Speaker 0: Yeah Well, I mean the classic American board game is Candy Land or Uncle Wiggly Which is roll the dice move the pawn roll the dice move the pawn And then maybe the spot will say move back to or move forward for you know.

396
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,864
Speaker 0: And eventually whoever gets to the end first wins.

397
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:20,870
Speaker 0: That's Candy Land.

398
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:24,250
Speaker 0: Mario Party sort of puts a twist on that.

399
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:34,001
Speaker 0: The first thing they do is they make the track a circle and it has different branching paths and there are different maps that you can play on in case you like one better than the other.

400
00:26:34,503 --> 00:26:41,789
Speaker 0: but all you really do is roll the dice and Mario walks that many spaces and then Luigi rolls the dice and he moves that many spaces.

401
00:26:41,809 --> 00:26:44,901
Speaker 0: and The thing is the track is a circle.

402
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:54,957
Speaker 0: You don't end anywhere You're just going around and around and around and as you go around you're trying to get stars and there's a number of turns.

403
00:26:54,977 --> 00:27:03,128
Speaker 0: so you can play a 10 turn game or you can play a 50 turn game or a 25-turn game and after however many turns let's say you pick 10 turns.

404
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:07,825
Speaker 0: So everyone takes 10 turns at the end of the 10th turn over as the most stars wins.

405
00:27:08,287 --> 00:27:09,190
Speaker 0: and that's Mario Party.

406
00:27:09,552 --> 00:27:20,927
Speaker 1: Now in terms of actual game mechanics and the way the game worked it was very simple and generally consisted of minigames and You know random movement and possibly very light tactical decisions.

407
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:25,502
Speaker 0: Yeah Tactical decisions are pretty much when do I use the item?

408
00:27:25,642 --> 00:27:26,886
Speaker 0: Which item do I use?

409
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:28,030
Speaker 0: Who do I use it on?

410
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,879
Speaker 0: Should I go left or should I go right?

411
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:33,050
Speaker 1: and the answer is always which way is the star?

412
00:27:33,630 --> 00:27:34,694
Speaker 0: Yes, it is always.

413
00:27:34,774 --> 00:27:38,328
Speaker 1: I go the way to the star or I avoid the star on purpose.

414
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:41,798
Speaker 1: Yep Now we can't talking about the gameplay.

415
00:27:41,899 --> 00:27:44,950
Speaker 1: isn't really the spirit of Mario Party cuz gameplay by itself?

416
00:27:45,454 --> 00:27:47,087
Speaker 1: These games are pretty piss poor.

417
00:27:47,107 --> 00:27:53,250
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean the main problem with Mario Party is that it could be very quick But it ends up being very slow.

418
00:27:53,310 --> 00:27:58,950
Speaker 0: You spend a lot of time watching animations and watching characters walk around the board slowly all unskippable.

419
00:27:59,051 --> 00:28:02,470
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah, it's most of it is completely unskippable and very slow.

420
00:28:02,470 --> 00:28:12,623
Speaker 0: I mean if you were playing Candyland, you could do it a lot faster because you just be like you wouldn't go one two Three four you just be like six ten.

421
00:28:12,844 --> 00:28:16,374
Speaker 0: you're moving ten spaces forward immediately, you know You know this waiting business.

422
00:28:17,096 --> 00:28:27,370
Speaker 0: it gets really pretty annoying because Mario Party is an otherwise fun game But you end up spending a lot of time playing it like way too long and now lose interest.

423
00:28:27,557 --> 00:28:41,287
Speaker 1: Yep Now the thing is the reason that these games are noteworthy at all Aside for the fact that the mini games from these eventually spawned such amazing games as WarioWare Yeah, and the like but that playing the game straight up is not fun at all.

424
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:42,150
Speaker 1: In fact, it's stupid.

425
00:28:42,511 --> 00:28:45,581
Speaker 1: In fact, if you played this game just you against the computer.

426
00:28:45,602 --> 00:28:48,010
Speaker 1: I submit that you have no life.

427
00:28:48,632 --> 00:28:51,621
Speaker 0: I did it only to unlock the maps for multiplayer.

428
00:28:51,821 --> 00:28:54,690
Speaker 1: Well, that is understandable slightly detestable, but understandable.

429
00:28:55,052 --> 00:28:56,278
Speaker 0: It was a detestable experience.

430
00:28:56,318 --> 00:29:01,135
Speaker 0: I did it while mostly reading a book and pushing air And practice.

431
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:03,465
Speaker 0: I did also build my minigame skills.

432
00:29:03,666 --> 00:29:07,970
Speaker 1: So yeah, they have a benefit Yes, but the game itself, like I said is pretty crap.

433
00:29:08,492 --> 00:29:20,362
Speaker 1: but the reason that these games are so iconic and the fact that and not just in our front-row crew group but in a lot Of social groups particularly in colleges and among kids These games take on a dimension unto themselves.

434
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:42,058
Speaker 1: because while the game itself is shit the risk/reward ratio of the game is Such that playing it with three other adults or people of equal intelligence to you and equal gaming skill to you With the requisite amount of trash-talking and getting more into it than an intelligent person should Makes for one hell of a time.

435
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:49,190
Speaker 0: I mean imagine if you know Pretty much anything in the world can be awesome if you get into it.

436
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:50,815
Speaker 0: I mean, yeah candy land.

437
00:29:51,096 --> 00:30:03,489
Speaker 1: if you get a bunch of people and you sit around some of you drinking some of you not Really fucking getting into candy lad and yelling and screaming and trash-talking You can make that game at least three times more enjoyable than it is.

438
00:30:03,791 --> 00:30:05,802
Speaker 0: Yeah, I mean you look at we're just talking about NASCAR.

439
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:07,170
Speaker 0: right NASCAR is pretty boring.

440
00:30:07,554 --> 00:30:31,210
Speaker 0: But if you really you know Make yourself a fan of a car or a driver and you really want them to win and you start paying attention to all the Crazy shit that you know the details and everything and you really pay attention And you like paying attention to it and you get excited about it and you have someone next to you Who's also excited about it, you know that you sort of feeds off, you know, and all of a sudden you're a NASCAR fan.

441
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:39,329
Speaker 1: Yep, and I talked about the risk/reward thing because one of the things that many Mario parties did very well and that the ratios changed a Little bit is indoor games.

442
00:30:39,831 --> 00:30:44,342
Speaker 1: But the goal of the game is to get stars and in the end pretty much.

443
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:46,748
Speaker 1: whoever has the most stars wins.

444
00:30:47,269 --> 00:30:51,625
Speaker 1: now How many stars will you get in an average game of Mario Party?

445
00:30:51,645 --> 00:30:57,023
Speaker 0: It varies Somewhat wildly but it depends on how many turns are in the game.

446
00:30:57,064 --> 00:30:57,284
Speaker 0: Yes.

447
00:30:57,325 --> 00:30:58,649
Speaker 0: It's like a 10 turn game.

448
00:30:59,231 --> 00:31:00,454
Speaker 0: Someone gets three stars.

449
00:31:00,494 --> 00:31:01,116
Speaker 0: They're doing real.

450
00:31:01,156 --> 00:31:01,457
Speaker 0: Well.

451
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:03,061
Speaker 0: Yeah in a 50 turn game.

452
00:31:03,241 --> 00:31:08,985
Speaker 1: You're gonna need like ten stars, but think about that it So few stars are available.

453
00:31:09,025 --> 00:31:09,750
Speaker 1: It's like hockey.

454
00:31:10,151 --> 00:31:15,710
Speaker 1: I mean in basketball someone makes a basket you don't even blink because you expect them to you blink when they don't make a basket.

455
00:31:15,911 --> 00:31:20,013
Speaker 1: Yep, but it will ease men's basketball Future.

456
00:31:20,073 --> 00:31:21,038
Speaker 1: I'm a joke, but never mind.

457
00:31:21,058 --> 00:31:23,350
Speaker 1: Just giving past all that good fundamentals.

458
00:31:24,233 --> 00:31:31,456
Speaker 1: But in hockey if someone scores a goal especially in some of the older days when the rules were a little different That was a huge fucking deal.

459
00:31:31,496 --> 00:31:35,549
Speaker 1: you get up and yell and scream, and it's the man of the year moment of the century.

460
00:31:36,511 --> 00:31:37,996
Speaker 0: Mario Party is the same way.

461
00:31:38,037 --> 00:31:38,920
Speaker 0: you get a star.

462
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:39,944
Speaker 0: It's like okay.

463
00:31:40,004 --> 00:31:41,329
Speaker 0: I got a star you.

464
00:31:42,374 --> 00:31:48,609
Speaker 1: And if you get a star as opposed to a star Which is basically a black star that takes a star away.

465
00:31:49,031 --> 00:31:51,600
Speaker 1: That's like if you're playing Monopoly, and then someone was.

466
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,490
Speaker 0: a star is not present in every version.

467
00:31:54,572 --> 00:31:55,148
Speaker 0: Oh, no, it's not.

468
00:31:55,912 --> 00:32:01,247
Speaker 1: But that's like if you're playing Monopoly, and then someone just gets a card and takes away boardwalk and park place from you.

469
00:32:01,488 --> 00:32:08,781
Speaker 0: yeah now Yeah There's the thing that really makes Mario Party different from just walking around.

470
00:32:08,821 --> 00:32:11,970
Speaker 0: the board is of course the mini games and the items.

471
00:32:12,594 --> 00:32:14,830
Speaker 0: That's pretty much what it comes down to as mini games and items.

472
00:32:14,890 --> 00:32:17,103
Speaker 0: That's why the game doesn't suck, and it's fun.

473
00:32:17,646 --> 00:32:23,152
Speaker 0: the mini games Let's say me and remember the only people playing right I go I roll the dice I move.

474
00:32:23,353 --> 00:32:27,488
Speaker 0: you know I land on a spot and sometimes a spot does something random.

475
00:32:27,529 --> 00:32:29,981
Speaker 0: sometimes It doesn't but it's usually not a big deal.

476
00:32:30,584 --> 00:32:31,347
Speaker 0: rim rolls the dice.

477
00:32:31,367 --> 00:32:33,916
Speaker 0: He moves Then we play a mini game.

478
00:32:34,377 --> 00:32:40,822
Speaker 0: whoever wins the mini game gets a lot of points and coins and all sorts of good stuff and ever lose.

479
00:32:40,862 --> 00:32:45,842
Speaker 0: the mini game gets dick and Then every turn you all play a mini game.

480
00:32:46,504 --> 00:32:51,850
Speaker 0: now at the end of the game Whoever well depends on which version of Mario Party you're playing.

481
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:55,461
Speaker 0: But whoever won the most mini games gets a

482
00:32:55,541 --> 00:33:02,949
Speaker 1: star and not only that but since they won more mini games They had more coins or whatever and they probably got more stars in the course of the game, too

483
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:12,094
Speaker 0: Yeah, which means they probably got more stars during the game, but also there's another star you get at the end of the game for Getting the most coins.

484
00:33:12,175 --> 00:33:18,040
Speaker 0: in mini games They're having the most coins something to do with coins and usually if you win the most mini games you have the most coins.

485
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:19,647
Speaker 0: You're gonna get that start to.

486
00:33:19,667 --> 00:33:22,380
Speaker 0: so winning all the mini games is really where the game is at.

487
00:33:22,761 --> 00:33:26,819
Speaker 0: They really should just have you play 10 mini games and say who won.

488
00:33:27,201 --> 00:33:29,651
Speaker 0: Let's see get rid of the whole walking around the board business.

489
00:33:29,933 --> 00:33:46,629
Speaker 1: the reason they don't is that if the game I mean I always said that I want Mario Party to be where I could skip the stupid animation so I could get on with Yep, but if you did that you'd be able to play Mario Party a lot more often you play those mini games a lot more and I think the game would lose its charm a lot quicker.

490
00:33:46,649 --> 00:33:54,340
Speaker 1: because now the game is it takes you have to have a time set Aside and people are willing to spend those hours playing this game.

491
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:58,520
Speaker 0: Yeah, well, I mean you could just play a short game like 15 turns in like an hour.

492
00:33:58,721 --> 00:34:02,700
Speaker 0: So but it doesn't really get the excitement because it's over as soon as you started.

493
00:34:03,063 --> 00:34:13,205
Speaker 0: You know when you had the big long game that's and it can get pretty epic with lots of big heavy-duty items like chain chomps and booze flying around and a lot of Wigglers and genies and shit.

494
00:34:13,466 --> 00:34:16,416
Speaker 1: It's one of those rare games where it does something.

495
00:34:16,437 --> 00:34:19,128
Speaker 1: That's really annoying You know, you have to wait through all this stuff.

496
00:34:19,168 --> 00:34:24,860
Speaker 1: It takes forever to play and in this case Adding that forces you to not play the game often.

497
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:29,480
Speaker 1: So when you do playing Mario Party becomes an event as opposed to just a game.

498
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:38,690
Speaker 0: Yeah, the thing is, you know, even if you set the time aside to play if you actually get down to playing it It's sort of like setting off cheap firecrackers.

499
00:34:38,772 --> 00:34:40,880
Speaker 0: Some of them might be duds and some of them might work.

500
00:34:41,321 --> 00:34:46,138
Speaker 0: You know, you got to make sure that when you play Mario Party, sometimes it just doesn't work and you go.

501
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:47,885
Speaker 0: Ah shit This isn't fun anymore.

502
00:34:47,925 --> 00:34:51,498
Speaker 0: Let's not play it and sometimes you sit down and it's fun the whole time.

503
00:34:52,081 --> 00:34:56,880
Speaker 0: Yep, depends on the group the time the mood what's going on all kinds of stuff.

504
00:34:57,040 --> 00:35:01,540
Speaker 1: And it's also one of those games where, you know, winning the minigames means you're more likely to win the game itself.

505
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:07,460
Speaker 1: And basically whoever has the most skill at these minigames as long as they don't they make proper tactical decisions will win.

506
00:35:07,801 --> 00:35:10,919
Speaker 0: Except there's a very slight chance of you winning by luck.

507
00:35:10,979 --> 00:35:19,437
Speaker 1: Yeah We'll see there's enough randomness in the game to where no matter how good you are The game might just totally dick you and make, you know, your Wendy win.

508
00:35:19,457 --> 00:35:36,460
Speaker 0: Yeah I mean there there is a certain You know ratio of luck to skill in the game and the luck is significant enough that occasionally I'd say about 5% of the time luck matters and skill doesn't mean anything.

509
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:41,198
Speaker 1: Well, actually the also the closer you are in skill to your friends the more luck matters because the closer the game is.

510
00:35:41,319 --> 00:35:41,901
Speaker 0: that is True.

511
00:35:41,961 --> 00:35:50,107
Speaker 0: if everyone is really awesome at all the minigames then it pretty much comes down to luck because otherwise you're gonna win an equal number Of minigames supposedly.

512
00:35:50,167 --> 00:35:50,348
Speaker 1: Yep.

513
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:52,800
Speaker 0: Such-and-such and also make the best decisions.

514
00:35:53,142 --> 00:36:03,256
Speaker 1: But like in a German board game if I you know If I get dicked by luck, like if a game is made poorly and the game just totally screws me There is not a single moment of enjoyment in that experience.

515
00:36:03,617 --> 00:36:09,119
Speaker 1: All I do is go Ah, fuck the game fucked me and maybe someone will say yeah, you suck Haha.

516
00:36:09,322 --> 00:36:13,970
Speaker 1: Then we just continue in Mario Party if you lose by complete luck.

517
00:36:14,031 --> 00:36:16,820
Speaker 1: if Scott was winning the whole game and he won every minigame.

518
00:36:17,422 --> 00:36:29,620
Speaker 1: But I happen to land on a thing and duel and win like one thing and then I get the like the bonus star And he steals all my stars and like I win by complete and utter like like imagine if we're playing a game, right?

519
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:33,494
Speaker 0: We played a hundred minigames and I've won all of them and I have ten stars.

520
00:36:33,615 --> 00:36:34,900
Speaker 0: rim is one nothing, right?

521
00:36:35,780 --> 00:36:44,110
Speaker 0: The last turn he lands on a spot and he gets to fight me in one minigame and in that one minigame I don't know something happens and he wins.

522
00:36:44,371 --> 00:36:46,180
Speaker 0: he can steal all my stars.

523
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,525
Speaker 0: It's possible sometimes.

524
00:36:47,626 --> 00:36:53,420
Speaker 1: Yeah, like the game totally dicks and there's stars flying around and I win and Scott loses Even though Scott was obviously better playing.

525
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:58,577
Speaker 1: That is one of the awesome things about Mario Party because no matter how good you are.

526
00:36:58,637 --> 00:36:59,440
Speaker 1: You might get dicked.

527
00:36:59,661 --> 00:37:05,655
Speaker 0: Yeah, no one's gonna come out of a game like that and say alright Like there you are better than you.

528
00:37:05,715 --> 00:37:12,824
Speaker 1: Hahaha like you almost everyone kind of hopes that crazy stuff like that will happen like the more crazy and Broken.

529
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:16,059
Speaker 1: the game you played was the more you'll remember it the more fun you'll have.

530
00:37:16,801 --> 00:37:21,192
Speaker 1: I mean, it's well like when we were playing against Ian in the champ world championship bout.

531
00:37:21,653 --> 00:37:24,620
Speaker 1: we got totally dicked like totally dick.

532
00:37:24,781 --> 00:37:28,309
Speaker 1: We probably lost anyway, we're doing that Well, but we were hanging on.

533
00:37:28,610 --> 00:37:35,800
Speaker 1: we had a decent chance of winning We were right there with him and the game just raped us repeatedly into the ground got stars.

534
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:40,780
Speaker 1: They're stolen star star and then we didn't have enough money from all that to buy the star.

535
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,682
Speaker 1: It was horrible.

536
00:37:41,702 --> 00:37:45,850
Speaker 1: It was terrible, but that random dicking was so hilarious.

537
00:37:46,400 --> 00:38:07,080
Speaker 0: We would play Mario Party where there was this one map this Bowser map where in the middle of the map if you got In there, it was a little tiny circle that you could just keep running around in circles in there And the whole circle is full of bad news real bad news And we would just try to get in there and try to run around in circles on purpose to make all the worst shit happen.

538
00:38:07,321 --> 00:38:11,639
Speaker 1: It's a game where winning is fun and losing is probably in many cases more fun.

539
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:15,740
Speaker 0: Yep, you know if you like WarioWare with all kinds of minigame action.

540
00:38:16,061 --> 00:38:17,787
Speaker 0: The thing is the WarioWare minigames.

541
00:38:17,827 --> 00:38:19,332
Speaker 0: they tend to be single-player.

542
00:38:19,392 --> 00:38:21,840
Speaker 0: It's like, alright, everyone play your own little minigame.

543
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:22,703
Speaker 0: We'll see who could do it.

544
00:38:22,743 --> 00:38:25,853
Speaker 0: Well, they call them micro games, right micro whatever.

545
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:26,635
Speaker 0: Well, they are.

546
00:38:26,696 --> 00:38:28,020
Speaker 0: they are a bit more micro.

547
00:38:28,341 --> 00:38:30,453
Speaker 1: I consider them a subset of minigames.

548
00:38:30,513 --> 00:38:30,855
Speaker 0: Yeah.

549
00:38:31,036 --> 00:38:38,260
Speaker 0: Yeah, but The minigames in Mario Party are less micro and they often involve direct competition between players.

550
00:38:38,521 --> 00:38:43,500
Speaker 1: Yeah, and like three versus one two versus two every man for himself all sorts of things.

551
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:46,772
Speaker 0: Yeah, this is bunch of different combinations and a bunch of different skill sets.

552
00:38:46,832 --> 00:38:48,940
Speaker 0: I mean some of the minigames are complete luck.

553
00:38:49,161 --> 00:38:50,809
Speaker 0: It's you know, pull straws who wins.

554
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:53,220
Speaker 0: some of them are push a really fast.

555
00:38:53,381 --> 00:38:55,440
Speaker 0: He pushes a the fastest our favorite kind of game.

556
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,900
Speaker 0: Yeah, the best was like dungeon duos is one of the best ones where you know, it's teamwork.

557
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,743
Speaker 0: You got two people.

558
00:39:00,884 --> 00:39:08,363
Speaker 0: one of them has to do one thing and the other person has to do something else in concert or The can can which is the game where the best at well That's the bet.

559
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:12,900
Speaker 1: that is a game that Scott and I are straight up over many games totally undefeated.

560
00:39:13,021 --> 00:39:15,079
Speaker 1: There's no chance anyone could ever beat us at it.

561
00:39:15,180 --> 00:39:21,763
Speaker 0: Yeah It's like I have to stop and then rim has to stop and then I stop and then he stomps in order to open this Work.

562
00:39:21,803 --> 00:39:25,660
Speaker 0: this can opener in tandem, you know It's all sorts of fun stuff like that.

563
00:39:26,303 --> 00:39:30,500
Speaker 0: If it's just for the minigames, I would still recommend getting some Mario Party Yep

564
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:38,031
Speaker 1: or even if even if you end up not liking Mario Party at all in the very least if you like Wario where Remember that this is kind of where that kind of game came from.

565
00:39:38,212 --> 00:39:47,037
Speaker 0: Yeah a little bit of history Yeah and some even if you don't like the annoying Incredibly long board game part if you don't have a bunch of friends to play that with.

566
00:39:47,479 --> 00:39:53,450
Speaker 0: you know There's seven Mario parties out now three for the n64 Four for the GameCube and the.

567
00:39:53,550 --> 00:39:58,326
Speaker 0: there's gonna be number eight is gonna come out for the Wii pretty soon.

568
00:39:58,467 --> 00:39:59,271
Speaker 1: the the um, what?

569
00:39:59,291 --> 00:40:00,054
Speaker 1: what were you gonna say?

570
00:40:00,898 --> 00:40:01,240
Speaker 0: I don't know.

571
00:40:01,541 --> 00:40:03,527
Speaker 0: I think there's actually Mario Party GBA.

572
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:04,530
Speaker 1: I think there was.

573
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,095
Speaker 0: there's this Mario Party advance.

574
00:40:06,116 --> 00:40:07,480
Speaker 0: So there are eight Mario parties.

575
00:40:07,863 --> 00:40:09,760
Speaker 0: There's also Mario Party e-reader.

576
00:40:11,161 --> 00:40:11,803
Speaker 0: It's terrible.

577
00:40:12,164 --> 00:40:16,959
Speaker 1: Yeah, the e-reader is in the pile with the Virtual Boy and the u-force and the Power Glove, right?

578
00:40:18,222 --> 00:40:19,994
Speaker 0: Wow the e-reader did you force?

579
00:40:20,457 --> 00:40:33,799
Speaker 0: yeah But Yeah, if it's worth it to get all those games just because they have different minigames and but they come up with a new Mario Party every year, you know, I mean the game came out seven years ago.

580
00:40:34,442 --> 00:40:36,952
Speaker 0: That was the first Mario Party in 19 2000.

581
00:40:36,952 --> 00:40:38,860
Speaker 1: I think Wow again, I'm feeling old.

582
00:40:39,241 --> 00:40:41,350
Speaker 0: Yeah, so or 99 maybe was 99 1957.

583
00:40:41,350 --> 00:40:49,032
Speaker 0: Yeah But Yeah, it just for the mini cuz there are.

584
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,720
Speaker 0: you could just play the minigames if you want.

585
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:52,046
Speaker 0: You don't have to play the board game.

586
00:40:52,086 --> 00:40:54,980
Speaker 0: So just to play all the awesome minigames is worth it.

587
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:59,780
Speaker 0: The thing is each new Mario Party has new minigames and new maps and everything.

588
00:41:00,263 --> 00:41:07,133
Speaker 0: But they also keep some of the old Popular minigames over from the previous versions like we have four and five.

589
00:41:07,634 --> 00:41:12,595
Speaker 0: five is probably a better game I think but it has some minigames that we're also in for.

590
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:15,789
Speaker 0: so it's kind of like Didn't get all new minigames.

591
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:19,824
Speaker 0: I got mostly new minigames All right.

592
00:41:20,468 --> 00:41:22,960
Speaker 0: So you're gonna get some redundancy buying all the versions.

593
00:41:23,181 --> 00:41:32,430
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's still better off than buying Madden and then buying Madden the next year where the roster is updated Yeah, and nothing else Unless you have friends nearby.

594
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:36,666
Speaker 1: don't buy all the Mario Party I don't know.

595
00:41:36,706 --> 00:41:43,649
Speaker 0: You don't buy them all, you know n64 games are emulatable or you know Just borrow them.

596
00:41:43,790 --> 00:41:45,520
Speaker 1: someone, you know has Mario Party.

597
00:41:46,002 --> 00:41:52,880
Speaker 0: Probably if you haven't played Mario Party at all It's worth playing at least one time in your life as long as you have four human beings.

598
00:41:52,900 --> 00:42:03,500
Speaker 1: Yeah my recommendation is either play it with three other people who also don't know how to play or Be the only one who doesn't know how to play but don't bother learning how before you play and don't ask anyone.

599
00:42:03,801 --> 00:42:07,994
Speaker 0: Yeah, because that's another thing about Mario Party is that you know new.

600
00:42:08,355 --> 00:42:18,204
Speaker 0: every time you're about to play a minigame You can practice the minigame before actually playing it for real and when you're first starting to play you tend to use that practice A lot.

601
00:42:18,224 --> 00:42:22,670
Speaker 0: I mean we use the practice a lot but Later on, it's just like screw the practice.

602
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:23,132
Speaker 0: Let's try it.

603
00:42:23,172 --> 00:42:24,920
Speaker 0: Whoo, and it's a lot more fun that way.

604
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:27,550
Speaker 0: So I recommend not practicing minigames.

605
00:42:27,891 --> 00:42:30,280
Speaker 1: You can really if none of you have played the games before.

606
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:37,850
Speaker 0: Yeah, it's okay to read the instructions to figure out what buttons do what but don't actually Do the practice mode just play the game.

607
00:42:38,172 --> 00:42:46,491
Speaker 1: So I guess before we close this off A big welcome to all you dig users who seem to have found us since dig Podcasts appeared you and your crazy dig podcast.
